<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion of the upcoming Nick Diaz vs. Benson Henderson UFC fight, seguing into Opie's anecdote about his son's destructive, yet creative, interaction with a "snowing Christmas tree," resulting in a house covered in fake snow.  This sparked a debate on parenting styles, comparing the hosts' and guests' childhood disciplinary experiences (including spankings, soap-in-the-mouth, and stick beatings) to modern methods like time-outs, which they deemed ineffective.

Opie then recounted seeing Billy Connolly's stand-up show and a chance encounter with Joaquin Phoenix.  A lengthy discussion followed about a recent interview with Joe Piscopo, detailing surprisingly candid conversations about his divorce and personal life, punctuated by crude humor and speculation about his sexual exploits.  The difficulty of balancing work and family life, especially with early morning show start times, was briefly touched upon.  Bob Kelly was mentioned as a scheduled guest, and Dana White was expected to call in later.

Anthony then shared personal experiences about his parents' divorce and his mother's mental health struggles during his childhood, contrasting his childhood sadness with his coping mechanisms as an adult.  The conversation shifted to reminiscing about Carol Burnett's show, particularly Eunice's comedic performances, and then to Joe Piscopo's career and Miller Lite commercials, including his Frank Sinatra impression.  A frank and often vulgar discussion about dating preferences and physical attractiveness ensued, interspersed with tangents about daylight savings time and a hotel's automated pancake machine.

Bob Kelly joined the show in-studio, contributing to conversations about living in Alaska and his experiences in Aruba, including details about the beaches and a comparison to other Caribbean destinations.  He also promoted a multi-functional travel bag he developed.  Further discussions about hotel accommodations and more Aruba anecdotes followed.  Larry King and Quentin Tarantino were mentioned as upcoming guests, along with the anticipated call from Dana White.

The conversation continued with a rambling discussion about vacations, particularly Aruba and its topless beaches, further escalating into vulgar descriptions of female body hair and explicit jokes.  Kelly promoted his upcoming stand-up shows.  A listener sent an ornament as a plug, resulting in more vulgar jokes about feces. Anthony described his extensive Christmas tree collection, including the aforementioned snow-producing tree, highlighting its flaws, especially regarding children and pets.  This led to tangents on robot vacuum cleaners and more off-color jokes.  Further reminiscences about harsh childhood treatment and a story about a dog eating a prime rib were shared.  The hosts viewed pictures from "Awkward Boners," leading to more sexually explicit jokes, followed by a discussion about a subway flasher and a concluding anecdote about a fight with comedian Rich Voss.

A subsequent segment focused on animal cruelty, specifically the Sarah McLachlan ASPCA commercials, with Patrice O'Neill in studio offering vehemently negative commentary.  An upcoming fan gathering at FH Riley's and the Rory MacDonald vs. BJ Penn UFC fight were discussed extensively, including the fighters' personalities and training styles.  The hosts and guest shared personal anecdotes about parenthood, including a graphic discussion about breast milk.  A call from Joe Piscopo, part of an ongoing “trilogy” of interactions, was mentioned, along with a call from Dana White, touching upon Twitter verification, Pinkberry, and upcoming UFC fights.  The segment ended with breaking news about the suicide of a hospital receptionist involved in a previous prank call.

Finally, Dana White joined the show.  The conversation began with a brief mention of the prank call and the hospital worker's death.  The discussion then shifted to UFC fighters, particularly Anderson Silva, his recent fight, and a Bentley gift.  They discussed Silva's next fight, *The Ultimate Fighter*'s move to Tuesday nights, and the show's success on FX.  The upcoming UFC fight card on Fox was promoted.  The latter half of the segment included plugs for Bob Kelly's stand-up shows and Jim Florentine's podcast, featuring a humorous bit about Florentine's disdain for gift-giving and Black Friday shopping, and a repetitive "Ah! Fluid!" chant.  Jim Norton promoted his upcoming advice show.  The segment, like much of the broadcast, was filled with profanity and vulgar language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Meow, meow, meow, good morning everybody!  Good morning, Jim Norton.  Hello, buddy.  Is today grim in the morning?  I don't know, I think he's on as well.  Oh, good.  Got Bob Kelly coming in too today.  Okay, good.  7.30.  And Dana White's calling at 9.40.  What is he calling about?  To promote probably this fight.  This fight's, I think, this one. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, this is the Fox one, right?  Yeah.  This is the biggest one for Fox.  Nick Diaz and...  Benson Henderson.  And Henderson.  Yeah, I can't wait for this one.  Did someone have to tap out of that fight?  I don't know.  Or that card?  I know Shane Carlin had to from the Ultimate Fighter show.  He hurt his knee again, I think.  Yeah.  But I don't know, if you may hear news, I haven't heard it.  No, there's something going on on Twitter.  Oh, I don't know.  Sam, do you know?  Why would you?  The hell am I thinking. 
[00:01:00]  Thanks for nothing.  Whatever.  Just go over in your little waif-like shirt.  So, um...  So, I set up the snowing Christmas tree.  Oh.  It needs to be talked about for a couple minutes.  Holy shit.  The dumbest idea ever.  I will be putting video up later today.  Why was it a dumb idea?  Why?  Yeah.  Well, when you have a two-and-a-half-year-old, they don't understand what the snowy Christmas tree is all about.  He thinks it's way more fun, and it probably is in his mind, to take his cups, his bowls, whatever he could find, his buckets, and take the fake snow and throw it all over the house. 
[00:01:30]  I wish he wasn't a civilian.  I wish I...  Sometimes I wish I could throw my kid in the public eye, because I would have such great video, but I just don't want to do that with my kids.  But he has decided that it's way more fun to take his little hands and get his hands in the fake snow. 
[00:02:00]  The snowy Christmas tree, basically, it's a huge, huge receptacle.  Receptacle?  Right.  Thank you.  And then the snow goes up the middle of the tree, and it comes out like a sprinkler on top.  So, where the snow is all collecting, he's able to get in there, and he's just taking handfuls and throwing it on the ground.  And he's putting what he calls his guys in the fake snow, you know, all his, like, army men and his dinosaurs and stuff. 
[00:02:30]  And he likes to throw them in there, which is clogging up the snowing Christmas tree.  I have snow all over my fucking house, and this thing's only been set up for two hours.  You know what, though?  When you think about it, he's right.  The two-and-a-half-year-old is right.  Right.  That's what every, like, non-rational person...  Like, if you don't just ration it away, that's what you want to do.  You want to pick this shit up and just throw it right.  That is more fun.  I know I'm the idiot here.  I assume, oh, a two-and-a-half-year-old would appreciate a snowing Christmas tree for what it was meant to do. 
[00:03:00]  No, man.  I remember as a kid, we all would use our toys in a different way.  And he doesn't understand why he can't, like, do that.  Well, he sees how wonderful the snow is coming down off the Christmas tree and realizes that that wonderment can be spread throughout the house.  Yeah.  You know the packing peanuts?  Yeah.  That's basically what the snow...  Styrofoam, right?  Styrofoam.  It's in the tiniest of balls, where if you even try to sweep it up, it blows all over the place.  Just the sweep motion.  If you're sweeping lightly, this shit is so light that just the slightest breeze... 
[00:03:30]  And it's everywhere.  ...or the slightest momentum just throws it everywhere else.  Do you have the one with the...  Oh, sorry.  Do you have the one with the music?  Yes, I do.  Because, yeah, they just flipped on the music on this bad boy.  This thing is awesome.  See?  This is the exact one I got.  This video kicks ass because it's nothing but the snowing Christmas tree, and it's four minutes and six seconds.  Oh, wow.  No, the video I made, which I haven't put up yet, will be 25 seconds. 
[00:04:00]  Here's my snowing Christmas tree.  Wow, what a dumb idea.  I want to see footage of the rest of your house with fake snow all over it.  It's everywhere.  It's everywhere, and it's being tracked around the house like you would mud or snow when you come into your house, real snow.  And you can't scold him and be like, that's bad, because then it's like, well, I thought this tree was a source of happiness.  I spent, I set it up, and then I spent, like, off and on the next two hours trying to just constantly sweep up snow. 
[00:04:30]  You didn't see this coming?  No.  And now I've realized I'm just going to have this fake snow around my house, and I'm sure we'll be finding it in April and May.  Yeah.  I've given up sweeping up the fake snow because there's an adjustment there, too.  If it's all the way on high, which he likes to do, it doesn't fall back into the collector.  I'll call it the collector.  It goes out?  Like, it shoots out?  It kind of misses, sure.  So it feels like it's actually snowing in your house. 
[00:05:00]  There's snow on the ground.  Somebody needs a Roomba for Christmas.  And then he's scooping it up by the baby handful and just throwing it everywhere.  Do you know how much fun that must be?  Like, I'm 44, and I'm thinking how great that would be to do.  If you're two and a half, that fucking rules.  Yeah, because there are no consequences.  There's no, like, this is a mess that's going to have to be cleaned up.  Who cares?  Just throw it.  And when I try to tell him, you know, to do something, his new thing is to tell me I'm bossy.  That's what he says?  He goes, you're bossy.  Dad, you've got to chill out. 
[00:05:30]  We're having a snow party.  God, I wish I was old school and just yelled and screamed.  It is kind of funny when he calls me bossy.  I'm like, all right, fuck.  Do you laugh when he does stuff like that?  Yeah, of course.  He doesn't like when you're bossy?  No, he goes, you're bossy.  I'm bossy.  I'm trying to keep the snow in the collector.  So he's literally now thinking, oh, if I throw snow around and call my dad bossy, it's a good thing.  I get laughs.  And, you know, we open the box, and I'm thinking, okay, you know, he understands helping a little bit.  Like, he gets all excited.  So I give him everything to put on the ground. 
[00:06:00]  And it comes with these decorations.  And I gave him a screwdriver.  I'm like, you know what?  He can handle a screwdriver two and a half just to make believe he's doing shit.  He took the screwdriver and started fucking punching holes in all the ornaments that it comes with.  What?  That's his first.  And then I gave him a little hammer.  I'm like, all right, you can tap a little.  You know, tap.  Make believe you're fucking helping me set this thing up.  And he's just breaking everything.  We're not supposed to give him, like, real tools.  Why?  That's why they make special plastic. 
[00:06:30]  But he does what adults want to do.  He does what we want to do.  He just hasn't been, like, he doesn't know that he's not supposed to.  Right.  That's what I'd love to do to a box.  Just stab my fucking screwdriver and do it and hit it with a hammer and throw shit all over the house.  How great would that be?  That is your first instinct.  When you pick up a hammer, you just want to hit things.  Oh, fuck yeah.  You're right.  You're right.  Like, if you're hammering a nail into the wall, all you want to do is just start smashing the wall.  I'm sure in his little fucking brain, he's having a blast.  But watching, it's like, oh, my God. 
[00:07:00]  So he threw, I mean, the ornaments that the snowing Christmas tree comes with aren't worth putting on the tree anyway, so.  Does your wife ask you why are you giving him screwdrivers and fingers to play with?  Nah, not really.  No.  No.  He plays with scissors and all that shit already.  That's good, I guess.  Well, why not?  Maybe it'll, are you of the school of thought that if, you know, he has a slight accident, he'll learn?  Like, you know what I mean?  No, he learns.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  He learns.  I mean, I'm supervising him when he's handling the tools. 
[00:07:30]  You're not going to let him cut his fingers off.  No.  So, I don't know.  And then, of course, I hear from all the parents that they're like, of course it's the dumbest idea ever.  You don't bring a snowing Christmas tree into your house with a two and a half year old?  You don't punish him?  Well, we give him the dumb timeouts, but he thinks that's part of his day now.  He puts himself in timeout.  He hits his little sister and goes, oh, timeout time.  I'm like, no, that's not what we're trying to teach you. 
[00:08:00]  He's like, I just want a break.  I'm going to go hit her and that way I get a timeout.  He almost gets mad if we don't give him his timeout for the day.  So then he'll do something, like, which deserves the timeouts just so he can fucking do his timeout.  That's where it's a weird thing between how we grew up and how you raise kids now.  Man, a timeout meant to us, you know, depending on how harsh it was, a good spanking.  Some people get slapped.  All that shit.  And that made you not want to do that anymore.  But isn't there something between timeout and hitting? 
[00:08:30]  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  I don't know what it is because you put him in a chair for a little while and they say, oh, at his age, a timeout should only be two minutes.  What?  And I try to make it hurt a little bit.  Like, I'll put him in, like, not the hallway, but in my vestibule area.  Or sometimes I'll turn the lights off and I guess that's not good.  No, you can't do that.  Why not?  Why you don't want to give him, like, lifelong nightmares?  Well, in the dark a little bit, some kind of consequence.  Like, look, you're going to get this again if you do what you did.  Yeah.  You know, we used to get hit. 
[00:09:00]  So I don't think it's that bad to put him in a, you know, not complete darkness, but darken the room a little bit.  So we can't look around at all the cool stuff around him.  Yeah, it's got to be something.  Like, you have to be able.  I was giving him a timeout and I was, I'm facing him away from the TV and us and everybody else, right?  Toward the windows.  And then I realized I'm just allowing him to look at an amazing view for his timeout.  Something I didn't get to see until I was, like, 40. 
[00:09:30]  He's just like, oh, wow.  He's like, wow, I get to see the skyline of New York.  Buildings, this is beautiful out here.  All right, timeout over.  No, I'm enjoying this.  So I don't know what it is.  You know, we're reading books and shit because the timeout thing is a joke film.  You should sit in, can you get a TV in a room and make him watch really awful shows?  A little clockwork orange action?  Well, yeah, but don't get, like, maybe, like, the Laverne and Shirley theme song and a bunch of terrible things.  He needs to make a two-minute video, and that's what he has to watch when he's bad.  Yeah, mini clockwork orange. 
[00:10:00]  I like that.  Some terrible, terrible sitcoms.  I like that.  My mom made us sit in the naughty chair.  What was the naughty chair?  It has a fist on it.  It was dad's reading chair.  See, your generation's different, even.  Yeah, I mean, it really...  Me and Jimmy's generation, man, we had a fucking...  I've told the story a bunch.  When we misbehaved, we had to go outside and get our own stick to get spanked with.  Yeah, that's what my parents had to do.  They had to go get a switch.  Oh, you did get hit?  I didn't, my parents...  No, I'm saying when my parents were growing up, they had to go get a switch.  Yeah, that was...  I guess that was a gag between the parents. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, let's see how big of a stick he comes back with.  Yeah.  I can remember my father washing my mouth out with soap.  Wow.  And holding my mouth open.  Never got that.  And taking soap and grinding it on my teeth.  Wow.  Graping it on my teeth.  How old?  Maybe six or seven.  But I had said some really...  That's that time where I was yelling curses.  Right.  And I was just saying, you know, shit, fuck, pussy, cock, this is your dick reporting.  I'll never forget that.  And I heard the jingle of the keys and realized they had walked in the back door. 
[00:11:00]  Wow.  I was just showing off for one of my friends.  Yeah.  But they just walked in and heard me screaming.  Which I'm not saying that that's the appropriate punishment, but they were probably...  That's unbelievable.  You got your mouth washed out with soap.  So I did, but I learned.  Did it work?  I fucking bet it did.  Because now you're squeaky clean.  Now I mean, when I turned 18, I started to be a pig again, but I was a good boy for like 12 years.  But here's the point.  You can't do that to a kid nowadays.  No.  You know, you can't.  You'll be in deep trouble.  Yeah, you'd be...  But even if it was acceptable, I don't think I could hit my kid anyway.  Could you hit him if he was going to run across the street? 
[00:11:30]  If the consequence of him not listening was getting really injured.  You know, that's a great question.  Yeah, I think...  That's what I think you should be.  I think in that case it would be, yeah, harsher.  Yeah, I think you might be right on that.  You just hit me up with something that...  Yeah, I think I would.  Because the penalty, like, if he should associate...  Because the panic that I would feel like, holy fuck, you just can't do that.  And he should be scared to do it.  Right.  Because he doesn't understand getting killed.  Right.  But he understands fucking getting hit.  Right.  So that would stop him from doing that.  But I don't know.  I don't know how people... 
[00:12:00]  You know, I'm not judging anyone.  I look at my kids and I'm like, how the fuck do you hit them?  Holy fuck.  I don't know how our parents did it.  I don't know.  I don't know how you separate that.  The punishment has to be something that they can't do to themselves.  Right.  Like, you have to have some kind of power.  Wait, what was the naughty chair?  It was stupid.  It was just a chair that you sat in when you were bad, except if you weren't bad...  Right.  You played with the chair.  It would just be a chair.  Yeah.  So what...  It wasn't a naughty chair until you were bad, so it really didn't...  So what...  So what'd you look at? 
[00:12:30]  Nothing.  You just had to sit in a chair for like 10 minutes.  And stare at a wall a little bit?  Yeah.  And that didn't do anything, right?  Nothing.  It was almost like, oh, cool.  I get a little break in the action.  I'm having so much fun, it's kind of nice to take a break.  Right.  You just rest.  You've just been running around the house in circles yelling things.  But yeah, I mean, I didn't really start acknowledging consequences until my dad could start taking things away.  Right.  Because that's how you disciplined us.  You just took away privileges.  Like, you took away everything that... 
[00:13:00]  I started taking away some of his guys.  I think that's the only way to do it.  I noticed that his guys are important to him, so I'd take a few of those away for a little while.  Stuff like that, but...  Well, we don't.  Does he ever cry when you punish him?  No.  He thinks it's part of his day.  Like, he's like, oh, you can get that back in a couple minutes.  No problem.  He literally, like, you know, was rough with his baby sister because he didn't have his time out yet.  I'm like, how do you deal with this?  He just shoves her and he's looking at you like, wow, time out?  Yeah, we're assuming that the time outs were doing something in his little brain. 
[00:13:30]  He's like, no, he just noticed that he hasn't had one of those yet.  If you make them longer...  They love their routines at that age.  Do you know when it will start to drive him nuts?  When he's supposed to be playing with his friends or supposed to be doing shit that he can't do.  Right.  Right now, it's no breakup because you just fucking hang out in the house anyway.  Right.  But you wait until he can't go out with his friends because he's got to sit there in a chair like a fucking tool and just stare at the wall.  Then he'll be like, oh, that stinks.  Or he'll repeat everything I tell him because we'll go, look, if you don't behave, no park, at the time, no park, no pacifier. 
[00:14:00]  I'll list all these things.  No ice cream.  And then he'll just sit in his chair and go, no park, no pacifier, no ice cream.  Like it's a joke.  Right.  Because he knows he's getting all that stuff.  You son of a bitch.  Maybe I should bring my mom over to discipline him.  Are you a softie with him?  Holy fuck, he'll behave.  Oh, but he's a sap.  Of course.  Am I a sap for what?  He said you're a softie with the kid.  I'm like, yeah, he's a sap.  First kid, yeah.  Yeah, of course. 
[00:14:30]  So your kid probably knows that.  Oh, yeah, I guess.  Like he knows that you're not going to do anything that bad.  But the rules are stupid.  I didn't make these rules for the new generation.  Do you think you and Anthony's dad are different?  Yeah, my dad was a softie.  No, you and Anthony's dad.  Oh, me and Anthony's dad.  Of course, yeah.  Yeah, but I mean, my mom was evil.  My dad was amazing.  My dad was a softie.  My mom was brutal.  So I don't know.  But I didn't make these dumb rules for these new kids.  Someone came up with this time out thing. 
[00:15:00]  It's a joke.  It's stupid.  It doesn't work.  Of course it doesn't.  It's stupid.  It just gives them a break in the action.  Because like Jim said, at that age, they're just in the house anyway.  I remember having to stand in the corner.  Is that kind of like a time out?  Yeah.  But the problem is when they're two and a half, you got to kind of anchor them down.  Yeah, standing in the corner would be not fun at all.  I hated that because it was so boring.  And you're standing.  You're getting a little tired.  That's what you should make him do.  Stand in the corner.  But he'll start wandering around.  And then how do you keep him in the corner? 
[00:15:30]  Well, Tom, every time he wanders around, say to him, and then use these words,  you're increasing your punishment exponentially.  See, I mean, we've done this bit a million times, but now they're coming in.  My mom used to hit me with a wooden spoon.  Filter on the ceiling.  I'd get slapped.  Once in a while, I'd get slapped in the face.  In the face.  Really bad.  I would have to really curse.  I don't think I'd get slapped in the face.  But none of it felt abusive.  It all felt fairly normal to what other kids would do.  I never felt like, oh, no, my parents were, you know, it was only when I fucked up. 
[00:16:00]  It wasn't for never for no reason.  You never had like, did you ever, were you ever fully forced, punched in the face by your father?  Never.  You were?  I've had a few, yeah.  Wow.  My father never punched me.  Wow.  I could recall maybe like two real good ones.  Wow.  Two really good ones.  No kidding.  For what?  Uh, school misbehaving, mostly.  Yeah, I sucked.  That was the worst in school.  That's right.  Punching his face is a violent accident.  In the face for bad school work?  Not all the time.  Like, it was literally like twice in my growing up days. 
[00:16:30]  Wow.  But like, there was an instance I could vividly remember where it was just like, I think I  was already in bed.  And I got like dragged out of bed to get fucking sucker punched in the fucking nose.  Wow.  Jesus.  I never got that.  No, me neither.  My shit was just verbal.  Everything was just yelling and screaming.  And, you know, and your shit would be destroyed.  I didn't have that either though.  If you didn't clean your room, you know, your shit would be destroyed.  And it was the dumbest thing.  Like, it could be sneakers laying out and that meant your room wasn't clean.  So next thing you know, your whole room would be destroyed in a pile. 
[00:17:00]  I'm like, really?  Over dumb sneakers?  Just stupid shit like that.  Is that why you're not that attached to stuff?  Like, is that why you can kind of get rid of stuff when you move?  Because like growing up, it was like always tossed out?  Possibly, but also because of radio, I moved around so much, you had to keep everything  in a car.  You know what I mean?  You didn't have the luxury of like having a storage unit or any of that shit.  That's why Oak likes breaking stuff all the time.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's just so he could deny other people their things.  I'm sure.  I'm sure it's connected somehow. 
[00:17:30]  Now you don't get to have something.  I don't do that as much.  I remember I took a bat to the knee when I was late once.  I was late coming home.  My curfew was like 10 and it was like 10.20.  What?  And I see my dad coming out of the elevator with an aluminum baseball bat.  Who's your father?  Al Capone?  No, he thought he was a tough guy, but he wasn't.  That was the thing.  Like, you know, because if he really was a tough guy, this shit would happen all the  time.  Boy, he punched you in the face and hit you with a bat.  I'd say he's a pretty tough guy.  Nah, but it wasn't like a beating.  It would just be like one good one. 
[00:18:00]  What did your mom do?  Nothing.  Yeah.  So you had like...  Yeah, my mom ruled our house.  My dad allowed her to do whatever the fuck she wanted.  All the discipline in my house came too late.  It was like 16 and 17 and then they're deciding like it's time to discipline the child.  They're trying to figure out, why is it being so bad?  It's like, I'm already an adult.  Like, you fucked up.  Like, you had all that time to fix it and now you got to deal with what you made.  You needed a naughty chair when you were a kid.  I guess.  I didn't have any.  A naughty chair.  A naughty chair. 
[00:18:30]  It's so stupid.  It's a terrible name for a punishment place.  Now it's just a time out.  It's just dumb.  I mean, the new child psychologist, I don't think they really have figured this shit out  yet.  You know, obviously everyone has decided you can't like beat the shit out of your kid  anymore.  I mean, for many generations, that's what you did.  And kids would, you know, wise up and, you know, start behaving.  Did I tell you my friend Veronica, who's a comedian, Veronica Mosey?  Yeah.  And she was on a train one time and she's just, uh, and she said she was watching this  mother like slap her kid and she said it was a full train and she just was sitting there 
[00:19:00]  watching this, like a little, like a two or three year old.  And I guess the mother was like slapping him and Veronica just snapped and then fucking  screamed at the woman and said, if you fucking hit that kid again, I'm going to hit you.  And the lady just stopped and like said something to her, but didn't hit the kid again.  Yeah.  When you, when you see someone like not, uh, you know, doing the right thing with their  kid in public, it's brutal.  I can't watch people hit kids.  I can't watch it.  I wasn't able to before I became a father, but now that I'm a father, holy fuck. 
[00:19:30]  Cause you understand, you know, the innocence of a child.  It's, it's, it's rough to see.  It's rough.  You don't see it as much.  Thank God.  No.  People in general don't do that shit in public anyway.  So maybe we're getting nicer.  Maybe politically correct people are just right.  I'll never be that way, but maybe they are.  Oh, just say this.  And I realized that I'm getting angry and I'm fighting for like, no, say the more offensive  thing.  Maybe they're just nicer.  Like anything else.  It's somewhere in the middle would be good.  Right.  Somewhere in the middle. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Go totally crazy with political correctness and the anti-bullying, you know, bullying does  is a healthy thing as well.  I think can be, yeah, I think it is to a point, I just bullied Sam to a point, to a point it  is, you know what I mean?  Not full out bullying where you, where kids are fucking jumping off bridges and shit, but  somewhere in between, I think should be acceptable to, to a point and bullying does not cause people  to commit suicide.  And the, the only, the really weird cases are where it's the one kid who's bullied by everyone. 
[00:20:30]  Like there's always that one kid who's just considered the fucking, the.  Be the piece of shit or the freak by every student.  That's the one.  Right.  No, yeah, yeah.  He would be this kid, but he rocks an adult so he can handle it.  You know, and he knows we're just kidding and I wink at him a lot and he winks at me  and, you know, we wink at each other.  Hey, moving on to other shit because we've done this, this break a million fucking times.  How was Billy Connolly?  I, I loved him.  I mean, I love Billy.  And, uh, I went, I was going to go by myself and, uh, I wanted my friend, Laura Levitas, 
[00:21:00]  who's a comic, just happened to text me at seven o'clock.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  So she met me in front of the, uh, Beacon Theater.  I think Joaquin Phoenix was there.  I saw this guy walk in and he looked like, uh, uh, this guy, Jeff, who's a live nation,  uh, booker, who's been a friend of mine for years.  I know Jeff.  Yeah.  You know Jeff from, uh, not Jeff Wills from San Francisco, but, uh.  Oh, then I don't know Jeff.  This is Jeff from, uh, Philly.  And, uh, I'm like, that looks like Jeff.  And, uh, I'm like, that's fucking Joaquin Phoenix. 
[00:21:30]  But, you know, I didn't want to bother him while he was walking in, in front of a bunch  of people.  You were positive that it was him?  No, but I'm pretty sure because.  You should have waited for him to drink a soda and see if he starts dribbling down.  Half of it wound up on his fucking neck.  But, uh, Billy went on about 8-10 and, and played till about 10.  They gave us great center stage fucking, like, seventh row at the Beacon.  And the guy is just a fucking master.  I mean, uh, he, he walks out and it took him a minute to get started. 
[00:22:00]  He was like, eh, he's starting fucking, uh, he's just talking about not too sure how he's  going to get started.  At the Beacon?  Yeah.  How many people?  Did he sell it out?  No, but he was very, I would say it was about 90% sold.  The only open seats I saw were right, you know what, he probably did sell it out.  They were, they were the open comp seats, which they do at casinos too.  Right.  So that was the only ones I saw right in our section, which were all comps.  So there's their comps that were given away.  Why can't they move the people down at that point?  They will, they will if you ask, but a lot of times people forget to ask.  Right.  How, how is he selling out the Beacon Theater? 
[00:22:30]  Where, where's he getting his fan base from?  Well, he, cause he's not as known in America.  Well, he opens up talking about, joking about, he'll mention Scotland in this big show.  Right.  And then he'll mention, uh, and he just makes fun of it.  They mentioned Sweden.  Ha.  Right.  Fucking, uh, New Zealand.  And like, Billy has fans all over the fucking world.  And, uh, just to watch this guy for the first couple of minutes, just kind of meander and  think, uh, about what he was going to do and just kind of welcome people to the show.  But it wasn't awkward or uncomfortable. 
[00:23:00]  You knew it wasn't like he was trying and missing.  He was genuinely just thinking about what he want and talking to the crowd.  It was so casual and so fucking relaxed.  And it's like this guy, what a master this guy is.  Not an ounce of fucking panic.  Not an ounce of worry.  And the crowd was a hundred percent just sitting there absolutely waiting to see where he went.  It was just, it was, I, I haven't sat there and watched a comedian for two hours.  You rarely go to see a comedian.  I never go, dude.  But Billy, I had to because it's fucking Billy Connolly. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  And, uh, we said hello afterwards and just what a sweet guy.  What a sweet guy.  He's in The Hobbit too.  Not the one we saw.  Oh, is he in the other one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And when he was in, he was talking about it.  He's, I think he's in the second film or the third.  Did he say the third?  I think he might've said the third.  Oh, I didn't really?  Oh, that's right.  I made the joke that it's going to take us about eight years to see his performance.  But actually that's not true.  The next Hobbit movie comes out next December.  And then the third one I hear comes out the following March.  Oh, wow.  Like three months later. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Maybe, maybe I got my timeline wrong.  And they're calling it the longest movie ever.  Oh, wow.  Probably a good four hour movie.  But you know what?  No, they're calling the whole Hobbit movie the longest movie ever.  It's one movie.  It's in three parts.  And they said that will be the longest movie ever.  I'll be honest.  Mainstream movie.  That ending of that fucking, uh, of that first Hobbit, man, it made me want to go see  the second one.  Like you will want to see the second one.  Oh God, yeah.  And the, uh, the, I can't just say enough about the graphics.  Like just to be wrapped up in a movie like that, like where you feel like it's just 
[00:24:30]  life happening around you is fucking great, man.  We're a week out from everyone else seeing the Hobbit.  Yeah.  I'm going to go see the IMAX.  I'll actually buy it.  I'll see it again.  Yeah, me too.  Actually, I think I might even bring my kid.  It wasn't that dark.  No.  Some of the story though, he'll, you know, he's still too young.  A little young.  Cause there's a lot of actual real story there.  Yeah.  Is there?  Yeah, I think so.  With the fake people in the fake cities.  Yeah.  That Tom Papa pointed out.  That was funny.  It's hard to follow that shit when everything's been up. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to Klung Dong.  What does it mean?  But I recommend, if anyone's in New York and you have nothing to do, check out Billy  tonight, unless he is sold out.  I'm going to guess that Friday sold out and then they put Thursday on sale second.  Right.  That's the way it will normally work.  So he's probably completely clean on that show.  But if you can go see him.  And you know what I saw there?  And she's so famous to me.  I fucking, it was down in the, in the VIP area.  After, uh, was, uh, Janice from the Sopranos.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Uh, and, and she's so, uh, she's so, uh, um, well, I, I forgot that she's a celebrity. 
[00:25:30]  I'm like, oh yeah, I know her.  And then I was like, oh, it's fucking Janice from the Sopranos.  Oh, Janice.  Janice.  How does she look?  She looks exactly the fucking same.  Really?  Exactly the same.  But I, I wanted to just start talking to her, but I couldn't remember her real name.  So I was, I kid, you can't just go, hi, Janice.  She's a tutoro.  What's that?  She's a tutoro.  Is that Ada Tutoro?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  See, I remember.  All I needed was the little fucking tip at Billy Connolly last night.  And, uh, he's just a nice man. 
[00:26:00]  You know, we, there was like 50 people backstage.  I'm like, fuck.  Cause I would do, I was literally, I almost dozed during the show and it was no reflection  on him.  I, I've been up since five 30.  I can't do that anymore.  I cannot go.  Of course not.  Fucking all those hours.  And, uh, but I'm like, I got to stay in and, uh, I'm glad I did cause he's just fucking  great.  Very cool.  Good deal, man.  Yeah.  I recommend him highly to anyone.  Um, it's really, uh, great trying to drive in at this hour.  Your traffic?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:26:30]  Are you cranky?  I blame my iPhone, first of all.  Um, the new charger, like I have a shitload of fucking phone chargers all over, all over  the place.  And, uh, they're all the old ones.  So I got my new iPhone, which takes that new charger.  I've won.  Yeah.  And me too, actually.  And I go, I go, eh, I think there should be enough power left on this.  Why go, why go downstairs and get the charger and plug it in? 
[00:27:00]  Nah, I didn't.  Wrong move, huh?  Wrong move.  So, uh, yeah.  The Kenny phone call, the alarm.  Because that's the other thing.  The LTE sucks up the battery way quicker on this iPhone.  Oh, it does, right?  Mm-hmm.  I have the same thing where I got one in my living room plugged into my laptop and then  I don't have one in my bedroom.  And it's a weird thing to not have a bunch of cords laying around.  And sometimes I'll say out loud, where's all my cords?  That's an interesting story.  I just wanted to contribute nothing. 
[00:27:30]  And then, of course, I don't need Naughty Boy phone anymore.  So, I don't have that.  Why?  Well, because I don't need it.  I don't have, you know, her.  I don't remember her, right?  The model.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh.  So, I don't need Naughty Boy phone.  Like, all, the only people I need is on my phone now.  So, Naughty Boy phone kind of goes to the wayside.  I don't really charge it anymore.  I don't carry it around.  Yeah, same fucking thing with me.  Yeah, yeah.  So, it's, oh, sure. 
[00:28:00]  Why are you touching and holding Sam like a fucking lunatic?  But I had the same thing with my Naughty Boy phone.  I don't need it.  You don't need it, right?  But there's some people that you don't want to give your new number to.  So, you keep them on the old one.  Yeah, and then I don't care if I have the old one or not.  It's just one of those deals where it's like,  I don't have the phone.  I don't care.  I'll check it maybe in three days.  And if somebody called it, I'll be like, oh, okay.  But for the most part, I don't care about Naughty Boy phone anymore.  That.  That.  There you go.  Just waiting in the cut in case you have to bring it out of retirement. 
[00:28:30]  Yes.  You never know.  And then the traffic on the expressway.  That's why I was kind of like, when we brought up the point of maybe starting the show later,  I was like, it won't help me.  Because I would leave later, and the traffic in 15 or 20 minutes difference is insane.  Like, I just wrote it off.  I sat back and went, I got it.  You know what?  Fuck it.  Yeah.  I lean back and just drive like every other asshole on the road that apparently doesn't want to get anywhere quickly. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, 7 to 11 would have been great for the extra hour of sleep.  But the bottom line is, it just, I mean, you getting in here, and even Kenny would have a problem getting in that.  Extra hour would fucking murder Kenny, too.  Unless you're in the city, it will not help.  Yeah.  It's dumb to start this early, to be honest with you.  It sucks starting this early.  I know.  Believe me.  It's dumb.  But I would absolutely have to leave.  It's dumb because it's a national show now.  Yeah.  I mean, if you really want to get into it, they got it like, whatever. 
[00:29:30]  They think it's an East Coast fucking company.  It's not.  We're broadcasting to the whole country.  They don't have any kind of West Coast presence.  That office in LA, which I've done interviews in, but it needs.  I don't know why they don't want to acknowledge that.  They want all the morning shows to start at 6 a.m.  That's so stupid.  Sure, there would be problems if you started later, as you're mentioning, but, you know,  we end at 10.  If we ended at 11, that means 8, you know, they could hear us all the way to 8 a.m. in California. 
[00:30:00]  That's smart.  So I'll be saying we should go an extra hour, and I don't disagree.  From now on, we are 6 to 11.  Fuck 6 to 11.  If they want to pay us, I'll fucking do 6 hours a day.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm sure the listeners would love if we went 10 to 11.  You know, that extra hour, instead of listening, you know.  It's never been a problem doing radio, but it's always been a problem that they don't fucking pay us properly.  You pay me properly, I'll do a 6-hour show for you. 
[00:30:30]  I don't give a fuck.  Fuck you.  This is easy.  This is easy shit.  Char.  Joe Piscopo from yesterday.  How great was he, man?  How great was Joe Piscopo?  Well, and people are just, I feel bad for people that think they're fans of this show.  Because I tweeted a picture of Joe Piscopo, and then all of a sudden someone wrote,  Oh, thank God I'm not listening today.  What?  You missed the big turn.  This show is so unexpected. 
[00:31:00]  You missed the big turn yesterday.  So instead of even hearing it, like, I don't even want to know what happened.  He writes, Oh, thank you for posting that.  Now I know I don't need to listen today.  I'm like, really?  And his point, I think, was that it would be the same stuff we did on the phone.  And the stuff we did on the phone with Joe Piscopo was amazing in its own right, cringy  and all that shit, right?  And then he comes in, and I was telling Mars before the show today, I was going to go down  the same road and just beat the shit out of him live and make everyone uncomfortable.  And then when he started talking about his divorce, I went, All right, we're going down 
[00:31:30]  a different road.  And I blew off everything I had intentions of doing.  And then we went down this other road, and it was amazing radio.  The guy was just spilling his guts out to us about being in a shitty fucking divorce situation.  And then he turned to everyone.  Now we all love Joe Piscopo.  How could you not?  He was great.  But this dumb guy, and I feel bad.  I mean, I feel bad because you say you're a fan.  You're like, Oh, thank God I didn't listen today.  You missed an amazing hour of radio.  Guys like that and Jeff Dunham. 
[00:32:00]  And I mean, just as nice guy comics.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love hearing the other side of it because, you know, it's so interesting to me to hear  because they're just guys.  But you see Joe on stage, and he's a happy-go-lucky guy.  Or Dunham's a guy who's fucking, you know, murdering and this sweet, clean comedian.  Clean, mainstream.  And he talks about his wife trying to run him off the road.  I'm like, This is fucking amazing to me.  Yeah, absolutely.  I love knowing that stuff.  So, Iraq, when is it going to air?  The 24th?  We're doing a Joe Piscopo trilogy, basically. 
[00:32:30]  A trilogy?  Yeah.  On the 24th.  And I hope we promote it separately.  In 3D at a high frame rate.  Yeah.  We're going to do part one, which is obviously us looking at the Showtime special.  A nice two-hour block of you dissecting Club Piscopo.  Club, all right.  So, then it's going to start with Club Piscopo.  Then it's going to go into the phone call we did with the guy, which was about 20 minutes long.  And then it's going to go into his appearance on the show.  It's an amazing fucking piece of work.  The trilogy.  The Joe Piscopo trilogy.  Because it started as one thing and ends as another with a lot of twists and turns. 
[00:33:00]  Lord of the what?  That flings.  Yeah, he really is.  Because he's always fucking...  Wow.  Holy shit.  Why would you keep getting girls pregnant at 61 years old?  Dude, that's just Joe's big Italian dick.  He can't pull it out.  No.  He can't pull it out.  It's a fucking...  It's probably a big, heavy dick.  It's actually a term they used to describe other dicks.  They call it Piscopian.  Piscopian.  He has a Piscopian cock.  He has a Piscopian cock, which he would not remove from the woman. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, my God.  He doesn't really have a big dick, does he?  That's hilarious.  We should have asked him.  Why were you looking at me like...  We should have asked him.  You might have heard something.  Yeah, see, I saw him.  I was peeking in the bathroom.  It's always these weird things you hear about celebrities.  Oh, I would peek at Piscopo's dick.  Without a doubt.  Without a doubt.  What's wrong with you, Danny?  It's not gay.  No.  That shit's not gay.  It's like Joe Piscopo's close to you and he's taking a leak.  It's not gay if you're curious?  Yeah.  No, I mean, if it's a celebrity cock.  If it's a celebrity cock is what I'm saying.  A guy on SNL.  A guy that used to do skits with Eddie Murphy. 
[00:34:00]  Yes!  Of course.  If Eddie Murphy just took his cock out and said, what do you think?  I'd probably give an honest appraisal.  Well, then...  Not bad, Eddie.  If it's Joe Asshole, of course you're not looking.  But, I mean, Joe Piscopo, you look.  I'm sorry, you look.  Or ask any white trash bitch from Jersey.  She'd probably know.  Exactly.  So, are you a woman between the ages of 18 and 19?  You might know what Piscopo's cock looks like.  Unless, of course, she looked while he was fucking her because he wouldn't pull it out.  I don't know how big it was.  He just...  Joe just grabs my ass cheeks and grunts it in my neck. 
[00:34:30]  That's what he calls the Piscopo way.  He's a fucking animal, that guy.  But you feel bad for the guy, but then you realize he does it to himself.  Yeah.  He's continuing to do it.  Yes.  He's 61.  He's got a two-month-old.  Oh, God.  No, two-year-old, right?  Two-year-old.  Two-year-old, yeah.  But he's living a...  Even though it's annoying, the divorces, you know what?  He's fucking...  That means he's got three women he's got to now take care of that he's not connected to  because he said he's not really sure where this relationship's going.  So he's got three women he's got to take care of and now three sets of kids. 
[00:35:00]  He's banging younger girls.  It's like...  That's every guy's dream.  He had a conversation.  But he purposely got her pregnant.  You think he...  Yes.  I don't think he does it on the list.  I don't know.  Listen to the story.  He fucking said it.  He got tricked into it.  He was happy.  She was pressuring him.  And he finally said, what the fuck?  All right.  I think he just doesn't like pulling out and jacking off.  I think that's right.  Listen to the appearance.  He basically says, I was stupid.  You know, I started believing that maybe...  All right.  Maybe this will be the right thing to do.  How many lows does he put in the don't knock a girl up? 
[00:35:30]  Like, you know how many times Piscopo has probably gotten lucky?  Yeah, right.  He's probably dumped so many lows that have had no consequences.  Or maybe they have.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  Maybe some have.  But my point, going back to this one guy, it's just interesting, some of these comments  we get after the show.  It's like, you don't really know the radio show.  Because at any moment, this whole fucking thing could turn in a way that's so, so unexpected  and different than what you were listening to.  The Piscopo thing was an amazing hour of radio. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, I thought he was a lot of fun, man.  That was great.  I mean, it was out of his mind.  Was it nerves or what?  He wouldn't stop talking.  I think Joe talks really...  Like, a lot of people, not necessarily nervous, but you're not sure of the situation.  And I also think you could see in him that he has the ability to be very fucking angry,  but he wants to be a nice guy.  Like, I like to see that kind of back and forth.  Like, you could see that Piscopo's not a pussy.  He's just a nice guy.  And he plays a nice guy.  And he doesn't want to have any arguments.  But if you came at him the wrong way, he probably would just fucking break your jaw. 
[00:36:30]  I saw it in his eyes yesterday.  I saw it in his eyes.  I'm like, okay, that guy, you know, he'll have some fun and he'll fuck around a little bit.  But if you go too far, he will try to strengthen you.  Yeah, he'll still...  That's odd that you bring that up.  Because driving home, I was thinking about the whole thing in the interview we did with him.  And I could absolutely picture him yelling at somebody.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Like, you could picture him being like, and you fucking bitch!  Yeah.  Like, oh, Joe Piscopo.  Angry Piscopo.  Did you believe...  I didn't believe when he said... 
[00:37:00]  When he said...  And she comes home, but I'm like, honey, where were you?  You know you didn't, Joe.  Where the fuck were you, you bitch?  Yeah, you're probably like fucking Carlo.  He took his belt off.  And of course, you know, I would love, love to hear her side of the story.  Yeah.  Love.  Because I bet she has a completely different fucking story.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then you've got to think it's somewhere in the middle of the truth, obviously.  That old gag.  But out in the hallway.  He made it sound like he was like a fucking saint.  Yeah.  Trying to say that he doesn't bang broads on the road. 
[00:37:30]  He probably dipped a couple times.  It's hard not to, man.  He probably dipped a couple times.  He was like, dude, ask me, did I ever cheat on her?  And I looked at him like, come on, Joe.  Like, probably.  You imagine if he said yes, did you?  Well, yeah, actually, yeah.  If you're a horned dog at 61 getting broads pregnant, I think you can't help yourself.  When we were walking out, he stopped me, and he couldn't resist talking about young women.  He just had to.  He, again, just bashing the shit out of women his own age.  He's like, Anthony, I can't, I just can't go to 30. 
[00:38:00]  I can't do 30.  They've got to be in their 20s.  Wow, really?  Because there's something about the skin, the nice, the, he sounded like the colonel  from Booking News.  They're just so, they're so cute.  I just look at them, Jack.  Are you my friend, Joe?  Are you my friend, Eddie?  Are you my friend, Eddie?  Are you my friend, Eddie?  When I was single, I absolutely dated my age as well, and man, just fucking couldn't relate. 
[00:38:30]  Maybe I just ran into the wrong ones my age.  I don't know.  But the ones I ran into, I'm like, wow, they're in a different fucking world than me.  Joe brought it up.  He said, like, when they go, oh, Joe, I've been a fan for a, he has such disdain for women  over 30.  Hates them.  I can take care of you.  No, you can't.  No, I don't think so.  You know, if you got a woman your own age, it would be a lot better than the problems you're  in now.  No, actually.  Sometimes you want somebody, younger women make you feel younger. 
[00:39:00]  It sounds stupid, but it's like, they're not dealing with the same thing.  Like, when I'm dating someone who's, like, 25, or my ex now who's 23 or 24, I like the  fact that she's not looking towards marriage and baby, like every woman my age.  There's just a different mindset.  Your age, they're not, they're, they're, it's passed them by.  Well, say women in their late 30s or 40, right?  They're looking for marriage at least.  Your actual age, they're like, if they, you know, they have one more shot at having a  baby, that's it.  Yeah, done. 
[00:39:30]  So they're going to fucking go into panic mode.  I'm the last shot they have, and that's really sad.  Because if you're betting on a losing horse here, ladies.  My sister set me up with someone my age, and we played golf one day, and I think I told  a story, and she was really nice.  She really was.  And she played golf, which I like, and I walked her back to her car, and she was really hoping  for the number exchange, and she's like, well, it was all awkward.  I helped her, like, get her bag in her trunk, and I knew there's no way.  Meanwhile, a younger girl.  Because, I mean, and not to be a dick, but I also was holding out hope to have a family 
[00:40:00]  still, and she was like, she was in her early 40s, I guess.  Dusty eggs.  Right.  Yeah.  But there was just something about her.  I just couldn't fucking relate, and she was really nice.  She was definitely good looking.  Did you tell that you were a caddy as you were carrying the bag?  Yeah, I used to do this for a living, like, awkward chatter as you put it on the track.  Oh, yeah.  And she's like, well, hopefully, you know, my sister was working at a country club at  the time.  I'm like, oh, hopefully you'll stop in again.  I'm like, yeah, that'll be good.  Yeah.  And, you know, she's looking. 
[00:40:30]  I'm like, all right.  And I got to my car and left, never saw her again.  And what is it that, like, younger girls, you can feel like, all right, I'll shove my tongue  down her throat when we leave here.  Wow.  But an older woman, you're just like, okay, shake hands.  Put the clubs in the trunk and leave.  See, I mean, this is not going to be, you know, you guys would probably laugh, but I  also dated younger, obviously.  But there were some that I dated younger that I was like, fuck, no.  Yeah.  No.  Way to their maturity level was just I couldn't relate to. 
[00:41:00]  Harry Potter movies.  Yeah, of course, they're hot as shit and all that.  But I mean, I was bringing up just basic references and they're like, what's that?  I'm like, how is that going to work?  Yeah.  I don't mind that sometimes, though.  I lucked out with my wife.  She's like an old soul.  So if it's somebody who's like, I had dinner with somebody recently who was, I guess,  you know, mid 20s, but not it wasn't even a romantic meal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she liked the prize that she got in the fucking I forgot the McDonald's meal.  Fuck me.  Whatever it is.  But it was it was I don't I just kind of get used to doing that. 
[00:41:30]  Like, as we're talking about something, I'll just say who somebody is.  Right.  Like, you know, like, like, like Network or Faye Dunaway.  Well, she was big in the and I'm like, I don't mean to keep doing that.  She's like, no, I don't know who they are.  It's interesting.  And it's like that type of thing.  I don't want to at least listen to you because that's thank you.  You're helping out my point.  I will bring up cool shit from my when I was growing up like, oh, my God, George Carlin.  Who's they don't even give a fuck.  They're like they're nodding like, yeah, yeah.  Like as they're looking around for where their drink is and stuff. 
[00:42:00]  I'm like, all right.  It's fun to maybe date young, but there's nothing here.  Yeah, that's but but if they're, you know, have an open mind like, well, fuck, tell me more  about this George Carlin or whoever.  I'm just throwing something out there.  Then that's different.  After a while, you just stop making references.  Oh, really?  Honestly.  Yeah.  You like like it'll pop in my head and be like, oh, that guy was in another movie.  And I know the movies, but and normally I would blurt it out as a little, you know, trivia  thing or something, whatever, a little small talk.  But now a lot of times I just check myself and go, I'm not even going to bother. 
[00:42:30]  But you might.  You know what?  She may want to see those movies, though, like sometimes like because I'm I like Clockwork  Orange and that was I was three when that came out.  You like movies that came out before, you know, I hear why you turn off Spongebob.  Oh, see, this is a movie that, oh, forget it.  Yeah, this used to also just be something on the sink, but now it's a character named  Bob.  Right.  Oh, forget it.  Why are you? 
[00:43:00]  All right.  Do not bring your child to The Hobbit.  I'm not.  I just I just think that he can handle more stuff than he can.  So not a crying baby at the movie theater.  Well, no, my kid doesn't cry.  No, but there's 3D TVs or not.  Imagine a 3D TV that you could watch that on home.  That's where kids will fucking love 3D.  Right.  But it's just not there yet.  TV is not there.  I will brag.  My kid has never cried in public.  He's never been the problem child.  I'm lucky.  I know I'm lucky. 
[00:43:30]  So I think the second one might be a problem.  Just a little bit.  I think.  Goddamn chicks.  I think the second one might be a little.  I think we got really lucky with the first one.  Not that there's major issues, but it's definitely a little different.  I do get some sympathy from my dad when I think back at what a fucking piece of shit  crybaby I was.  God, imagine that.  Imagine you're a fucking guy and you got your son with you and he's just pissy eyes all  the time.  Wah!  Wah!  But maybe you should have taken care of his home life. 
[00:44:00]  Probably.  You were fucking reacting to what the fuck was going on around you.  Wah!  And he thinks it's completely normal to have fucking yelling matches and throwing shit  every night.  But Joe wasn't crybaby pissy eyes.  You know?  My brother was like the fucking...  He was the man fucking son.  And I was a little pissy half a fig.  Well, I kind of agree with you, but I also think that, you know, your dad...  I'm sure your dad's a good guy, but he just yelled probably more than he should have.  And he turned what was a sweet puppet artist into a fucking... 
[00:44:30]  A raving hate monger.  Ha ha ha!  What was a sweet, curious boy who just wanted to make...  He turned the fucking child from sixth sense to little girl doing a puppet show into the  fucking mother poisoning her.  You were holding out hope that they were going to figure it all out.  Yeah.  And Joe was like, oh, jeez, I know what this is.  I'm just going to fucking move on with my life.  I was in such denial.  Like, I used to... 
[00:45:00]  In bed at night, I'd think about it and go like, oh, you know, I know kids talk about  divorce, but that's not me.  That's not my family.  That's not going to happen.  And then they, you know...  Divorce was rare when we were divorced.  I thought, like, that was something that happened to people in movies.  That was...  It was extremely rare.  You forget.  Yes, because now it's just...  There was always one in your town, and they were always looked at like weird.  Like, what?  Yeah.  You're...  You're not married anymore?  What the fuck?  It was always a strange thing. 
[00:45:30]  Yes.  I didn't want to be that.  It was always...  Yeah.  Like, it was like a dark cloud over that house.  Yes.  Your parents are what?  They don't live in the same house.  And then if I was over a friend's house or something, or relative, and I was watching  a movie that involved any way, shape, or form divorce, like the married couple is arguing  and talking about divorce and stuff, I would get all embarrassed and put my head down because  I thought they were, like, thinking that that was me and, like, oh, it was so... 
[00:46:00]  Oh, it was terrible.  Poor, shy, sad little Anthony.  Oh, I was so sad.  Poor, shy, little scaredy-cat cutie Anthony.  Aw, little puppet boy.  With my velour shirt.  Aw, heety-doo-dee-doo, a puppet.  You're a faggot!  All right, put it away.  Give me a beer, Dad.  You're right, Dad.  Why explore my creativity?  You're right.  Let me just funnel all this anger.  You're right, Dad.  I'll start doing shots at eight years old.  Yes.  I'll take all the anger I have toward you and Mom and funnel it toward brown-skinned people. 
[00:46:30]  Yes, I'll blame them, because you would have.  I'm sorry, Dad.  You're wrong.  I mean, you're right.  Oh, that's terrible.  There's a whole half a planet suffering because of one spaghetti fucking throwing against the wall.  Spaghetti hits the wall.  Exactly.  And that's it.  Well, my household was different, and I was very aware who the problem was in my house,  and I secretly hoped that there would be a separation.  Oh, did you really?  But they got along, which was so fucked up.  They got along well. 
[00:47:00]  Did you honestly, you hoped that they would?  I hoped.  When my mom used to go away, which meant fucking mental shit, mental hospitals,  where, oh, she's in Portland.  Like, they'd make up cities.  Take the fucking mafia when you go to jail.  She's away from work.  That was the most peaceful fucking week.  It would pop up every once in a while.  A nice week of, ah, no yelling.  Nice.  Now take me to the institution.  Then she'd come home, and the first week would be good, and then back to the same shit. 
[00:47:30]  Wow.  Because she doesn't want to learn or take care of her own issues, whatever.  Oh, boy.  I talked to her the other day because she's got some kind of Christmas party at the home she's living at.  I've got to figure out where that is.  Oh, shit.  I've got to figure out where that is.  I think she's at the same place.  She was inviting you to it?  Dude, I swear to you, sometimes I think she does this shit on purpose, and I think she listens to us.  She goes, hey, do you watch that Dish Nation?  Oh, my God.  I'm like, don't even fucking tell me you like that. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, my God.  But then, like.  Great show.  And that's all I got on it because then the reception was really bad.  Because I was, like, trying to tell her, like, you don't like that, do you?  She's like, what?  What?  And I'm wondering if she's doing this on purpose.  It's terrible.  Dish Nation stinks.  Is that the radio shows?  Yes.  But, I mean, then again, she's in her 70s, so maybe that's the type of shit.  If she likes it, that's exactly why we should hate it. 
[00:48:30]  Yes.  If an older woman likes it, it's not the type of shit.  I don't know, but, I mean, when I was getting along with my mom, well, I'd get along with her.  It is what it is.  It's like, she's into edgy shit.  She was into Carlin and all that.  She loved Carol Burnett.  Loved it.  She would fucking, I was ready to say how.  She would lose it to Carol Burnett every night.  That was her show, man.  That shit was funny, though.  She understood good comedy.  Absolutely.  That shit was funny.  She understood a good story, and she would tell a good story and had a great laugh.  But, unfortunately, she let the darkness take her. 
[00:49:00]  I was watching old Carol Burnett recently when they were her and Tim Conway and Vicki Lawrence.  came in for the town hall.  And just watch it all.  That Eunice, those sketches are the gong show sketch.  Feelings, where she's singing feelings, and it's fucking abysmal.  And then Eunice, she's just had so much enough of her family, and she just turns into a cunt and screams.  She's so funny, man.  That is a fucking brilliant... 
[00:49:30]  Amazing.  ...67 to mid-70s, around, or whatever.  Yeah.  Or 75.  Harvey Korman, the Tim Conway, the Carol Burnett, and then the Vicki Lawrence, Steve Lawrence.  Vicki Lawrence was great as Mama, though.  Yeah, I got sick of that character.  Did you?  I really did.  Well, they really pushed the shit out of me.  They pushed the shit out of that character of hers.  I didn't think she was as good as the others.  Well, Eunice was the star of that sketch.  Oh, I know.  Of course.  That awful hairdo.  Carol Burnett played amazing characters.  I mean, for the younger people in our audience, if you've never searched out the Carol Burnett show... 
[00:50:00]  Does it hold up, though?  Yes.  Some of it's...  It does.  You have to know, this was on regular TV in the late 60s, early 70s.  Yeah.  And look up the sketch on YouTube.  It's Carol Burnett...  Eunice does the gong show.  It's a two-part sketch.  And this was live fucking television.  That format just doesn't exist anymore.  No.  The variety show.  Because I don't think anyone could pull it off.  No.  It's one of the reasons why it doesn't exist.  I don't think...  Who could pull this off? 
[00:50:30]  Name one fucking comic that could pull this off.  The closest thing is, like, SNL, but that isn't even near what this is.  Right.  But the variety show with the same cast doing these things...  No.  Because those characters on SNL aren't as riveting.  Right, right.  Like, Eunice was weird.  Like, you really felt sad for her, too.  Like, she's just in this dogshit existence with this harmless but mope of a husband and this  fucking horrible, cunty mother.  It was such a good show, man. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, is she funny.  I think I want another coffee.  Thank you, Ken.  That was great.  Fuck.  And there really wasn't much else to choose from back then.  No.  You put CBS on, you were watching this fucking show.  Feelings.  Oh, her singing stunk.  She never set foot in that kitchen.  I don't know.  We've got to find one that works for radio.  We'll just find her singing.  It's horrible.  Is it in this sketch?  Yeah, yeah.  This is the gong show.  She's trying to...  She's going to do the gong show and she just rehearses. 
[00:51:30]  It's at the end of this part.  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  Hey!  Hey, I wrote a whole new thing for my song that I'm going to do out there.  I got a real inspiration.  Now, I want you to listen to it.  I think you're going to like it.  I want to see what you think about it.  Okay?  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Mama.  Mama is just sitting there.  She's singing to her mama and Ed.  I asked you what you bought today.  Just a few necessities, Ed.  Necessities?  Yes, necessities. 
[00:52:00]  I mean, a person doesn't go on TV looking like a sack of potatoes.  I mean, why don't you just wise?  Look, we are talking about national TV here.  And I am talking about the way you're leading us down to the poor house, which, believe me,  you better be prepared to move into when you come home next week.  If I come home next week.  Just what do you mean by that?  Well, see, they learn all these lines in one week.  From week to week. 
[00:52:30]  It's amazing.  And they're not looking at fucking cute parts.  No.  No.  They know their parts.  They're not in Hollywood for a while.  A television part.  Eunice, you are nuts.  That's for a little bit to a...  Oh, yeah.  I don't know where she does it.  Would you like to hear the letter again?  No, I would not.  Eunice, don't read it again.  When she'd scream at mama, almost crying.  I love when she would yell at her fucking mother.  She'd just snap it.  You have to zip through it a little bit because it's towards the end of this. 
[00:53:00]  Mama, my friends, my friends, my little day.  Why don't you even fixin' your leg down on my face?  Oh, man.  I'm tryin' to forget my feelings of love.  Feelings.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, feelings.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, feelings again in my arms.  Oh, yes. 
[00:53:30]  Feelings.  I don't think it works on the radio, but just Google it and watch it.  It's fucking brilliant.  That's old school.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to see the Joe Piscopo.  I saw Danny found an old Joe Piscopo commercial.  A commercial?  Yeah.  Was it Ballets?  No, he's a spokesperson for Miller.  Oh, right.  I remember this.  He was fucking huge.  He was on...  Dude, you do forget how fucking huge Piscopo was.  He got to fucking do Miller Lite or Miller commercials. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Did they have Miller Lite back then?  Yeah.  They were the big Miller Lite.  Okay.  When I played hoops, I could beat anybody.  Still can.  Yo, cheap little one-on-one or what?  Get out of town, man.  Chicken.  At least I can enjoy a Miller Lite while I'm looking for a game, right?  How about you, Peanut?  Ah.  Whipped.  Light tastes great, but these bean poles probably drink it because it's less filling.  Hey, yo, bean pole, you want to show me what you got?  Yeah, well, he's walking through all these tall basketball players. 
[00:54:30]  But it's weird.  I remember that commercial.  Imagine the pussy he was getting then.  Yeah.  With his mullet.  I know.  He did have a fucking mullet.  Joe always had a mullet.  Yeah.  Joe's a mulleted fool.  But I remember those commercials.  He is kind of a fool.  A lovable one, though.  You forget how big he was.  And we goof about some of his act, as it were. 
[00:55:00]  But remember when he did Frank Sinatra singing the Rolling Stones?  No.  It was a huge fucking bit.  Now I got to hear it.  He did, yeah, Frank singing Under My Thumb.  I'm not going to say.  Oh, I don't remember that.  It was fucking huge.  It was a huge bit.  Yeah, find that bit.  Frank Sinatra, Joe Piscopo doing.  Can't you see I'm watching Joe Piscopo dressed up?  As a professional wrestler.  Oh, Jesus.  These commercials, though, man, for the time, were huge.  Which is it? 
[00:55:30]  Huge.  They were Super Bowl, Sinatra singing Rolling Stones.  These were Super Bowl commercials, too, man.  Yeah, yeah.  He had Miller-like Super Bowl commercials.  Huge.  That was one of the...  I mean, when you think of Piscopo on SNL, this was one of his premier bits.  Oh.  Huge.  I'm not going to see the Stones.  I'm just not going to pay that fucking money.  Oh, no.  I want to see them, too, but fuck them.  $7.50?  Fuck them, they're $7.50 a ticket bullshit.  Fuck them.  Jesus.  That's a lot of fucking money. 
[00:56:00]  I would only pay that if I could have a meet and greet with them.  No Piscopo singing Under My Thumb?  No.  Not yet.  Hang on.  My thumb.  That girl.  Oh, right, right.  I remember that.  She shot me down.  My thumb.  That chick.  It was fucking funny, man.  For the time.  But, yeah.  Time does move by, doesn't it?  That's why we like younger women.  It's a way it feels like you're stopping time because you're going back to... 
[00:56:30]  I don't think of it.  You know something?  It's not that psychological.  It's not that deep.  It's, well, it's a lot to do with just what is physically attractive to you.  That's also correct.  I mean...  Yes, I like that, too.  But there is, I understand what you're saying because to sit there and have a conversation  with a woman my own age is fucking horrendous. 
[00:57:00]  Shut up.  Well, here's why I agree with you, but you're right.  It is a part of, it's just hotter, much hotter looking into touch.  But it's kind of hard to believe that from the man who likes the helicopters and fucking  just like all these childish things and wants to just sing karaoke.  It's not like the rest of your life is grown up stuff.  You're a fucking child.  You're wearing an Army Man shirt.  You want to shoot guns and fly helicopters.  An Army Man shirt.  You're a nine-year-old.  Yeah, I'm just like G.I. Joe. 
[00:57:30]  Why the Army Man shirt?  I don't know.  A lot of Army Man shirts.  I really do have a few of them.  You're waiting for the revolution?  Well, dare to dream.  But, no, 5-11 sent me a bunch of them.  Oh, that's actually under my thumb by the Rolling Stones.  Oh.  Yeah, 5-11 sent me a bunch of them, so I just wear them, and they're very comfortable.  But, yeah, I realize my closet isn't full of adult clothing.  Well, once you step out of it, it will be.  That's a terrible dog joke. 
[00:58:00]  It's just corny.  We get it.  It's gay.  I'm gay.  Good one, Joe.  Somewhere my dad's going, you're right, that fag.  My dad had me pegged as a faggot.  He really did.  I hope before he died he realized that, you know, I was hetero, you know, as much as I could be.  I remember I didn't want to, we went out to California, me and my brother, Joe Curry, Frank Bush, our friends, to visit my dad out at the ranch.  And I had pictures of things from back here in New York. 
[00:58:30]  My car, what I was doing for a living, and my girlfriend at the time.  But my girlfriend at the time was fucking heinously ugly.  Wait, how old were you?  Not really ugly.  This was maybe my mid to late 20s.  Oh, you had an ugly chick?  Mid 20s.  Ugly as sin.  Was she fat?  No.  She was very skinny.  Why'd you go out with her?  Uh, because I was a fucking broke-ass tin knocker. 
[00:59:00]  Was she good fuck?  A little hot, not even.  Oh, no.  I don't even think she really liked sex that much.  Which is why I started, uh, you know, cheating on her.  Okay.  But, uh, I did have pictures of her and stuff, and, uh, I remember my dad, and then my brother, who was going out with this, uh, very, very pretty girl.  Yeah, and, uh, he actually brought her to California with this whole trip that we took. 
[00:59:30]  So, there is this girl, very pretty, hanging out.  My dad sees her, and my dad was, like, you know, smitten with her and everything.  And he kept asking me, so who's this girl?  Where's, you know, you got any?  And I was like, yeah, I got pictures, but, oh, they're, they're in the car.  I never wanted to, like, get the pictures and show him.  She was fucking bat-face ugly.  And all I kept thinking was, like, God, he probably thinks again that I'm a fag.  Because I didn't want to show him pictures of who my cheek was. 
[01:00:00]  You should have just brought a picture of another girl.  Then your brother would have rather like that.  I should have.  Like Costanza at the fucking club, yeah.  This is my fiancé.  Yeah, my brother would, and my brother.  And then it got, it reached the point where I think they were goofing on me.  Where my brother and my dad would start going, like, Anthony, why don't you, where are the pictures?  Where are the pictures?  And they'd start, like, laughing, because I think they wanted me to show the ugly.  Had Joe seen her?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So Joe probably said, dang, she's a fucking beast. 
[01:00:30]  Just ugly.  Ugliest sin.  How long did you date this monster?  Probably eight months, I guess.  It was a while.  That's funny.  But, yeah.  Oh, is she fucking ugly.  Ugly.  Ugly.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  I remember when I were an ugly broad.  No?  Nope.  You're a lucky guy.  Banged a few.  Well, you were one of those guys, though, that had, like, attractive girls coming up to you.  I sure did.  I don't work.  I sure did. 
[01:01:00]  I'm spinning plates and juggling trying to fucking get attention.  She hopes to put up some numbers.  Did you put up those numbers?  I put up some numbers with the good-looking bruds.  I did all right.  I would rather not, like, go out with someone if they were ugly.  Yeah, well.  You know what?  Oh, some of us didn't have that fucking option.  Really?  We had to go out with whoever would fucking go out with us.  And this is how it works.  I'll break it down.  Like, you're absolutely attracted to someone first.  And the people that deny that with the beauty is skin-deep shit, shut up. 
[01:01:30]  We all look at people like, wow, she's really attractive.  And then you hope that she has something behind her after that.  That's how that works always.  Do you think it works that way with girls, too, though?  I remember.  As much?  I think girls are a little more into personality.  They say that shit, but I don't believe it.  They say that that's not as important, but I don't believe it.  It's as easy as getting blown off by some chick.  It's just like she looked at you and was just like, nah, didn't give you a shot. 
[01:02:00]  I'm not saying every girl's like that.  That's for sure.  But I think more girls will test the waters and see what the personality is like more  so than a guy ever will.  I think you're right, but I think they would.  I think it's men are judgmental and they'll instantly make a decision.  Instantly.  Right.  I think chicks will give you a chance, but you still need that.  You need that time.  You have to convince them to get the time.  Oh, the personality doesn't hurt, but I think women are looking.  It's way more work.  But I think women are looking for a physical attraction as well. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  Everyone is.  But I think the women will give you a little more of the benefit of the doubt than the guys  will as far as looks goes right off the bat.  You're probably right about that.  Yeah.  To a point.  I remember when those feelings started happening.  Those feelings.  And we would go over to my mom's friend's house and they had a daughter that was actually  probably two years older than me at the time.  We really got along.  And, you know, I think both families were hoping, like, maybe at least we would date. 
[01:03:00]  I was like, fuck, 14, 15.  Arranged marriage thing going on here.  And I remember thinking to myself, and I'm going to sound like a complete asshole, I'm like,  I would never be seen with this fat broad.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I said that to myself.  I'm like, no.  And she was great.  She was, you know, she was attractive and she had a great personality, but I remember  thinking then, no.  A little chubby.  Yeah.  Too chubby for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And maybe that's wrong.  I don't know.  It's what it is.  It can't be right or wrong. 
[01:03:30]  It's how you, you know.  But I was also, like I said, 14-ish.  Yeah.  Like, no, man.  A lot of peer pressure there.  Yeah.  Want a break?  Sure.  We got Bob Kelly coming in today.  Bobby.  And we got a Dana White phone call.  And next week, I just want to promote that we're going to have Larry King in the studio  again.  He's great.  We love when Larry stops by.  Yes.  And his internet show is doing very well.  Of course.  Very well.  CNN got rid of him.  He goes on the internet, and that's the place where a lot of things are happening, and his 
[01:04:00]  show's doing well.  He's getting a lot of A-listers and everything to do his show.  Wow.  So he's reinventing himself at his fucking age.  I'll go for him.  70-something.  Probably pushing 80 at this point.  Yeah.  The internet's certainly a fucking viable option.  And then Quentin Tarantino, a lot of people are like, why didn't you get Quentin Tarantino?  He was that serious?  He's in next week.  He'll be in next week.  Which means we got to go see that movie.  I'm going to see it.  Django.  And I'm also going to see, we have Judd Apatow, so I want to see his movie, too. 
[01:04:30]  When is Judd coming in?  A couple weeks, I think.  Nice.  And I want to give out an email address.  Ooh.  Ooh.  For chicks?  No, it's from my new advice show on Wednesdays from 10 to 11, and there'll be a replay at  some point.  Jim Norton Show at Gmail.  And I've gotten some fucking, I Twittered it yesterday.  I got a bunch of actually really good.  Gives you the right to give people advice.  You're a wreck.  Well, I'm motivational and inspirational.  Whoa.  I'm going to start selling myself like a black radio station.  Motivational and inspirational. 
[01:05:00]  You know?  Sounds good.  Yeah.  I'm in.  I'm departmental, not detrimental.  What does that even mean?  Departmental?  All right.  Sounds good.  So yeah, with your advice, questions, I'm going to take live phone calls, and I'm also  going to go to some emails and helpful.  I've been actually poring over them and with some very, very helpful advice.  I guarantee results.  What's the name of the show?  Jim Norton Show.  No.  I thought it was something else.  Oh, you know why we didn't call your friend Jim Norton? 
[01:05:30]  Because somebody on Twitter, normally on Twitter you want to strangle them, but they pointed  out deftly that Alison Rosen, her show is called Your New Best Friend Alison Rosen, her  podcast, and that was a little too close, so I didn't realize that.  So I didn't want to call it something that's similar to somebody else.  That's her thing, and I don't want to step on it.  She's more famous.  Exactly.  So you just take it.  Yeah, but I don't want to think I was taking her shit, so I just said, fuck it.  I told Steve, enough.  This is the Jim Norton Show.  If that's not good enough, then I don't deserve to have any success with it. 
[01:06:00]  I like that Jim Norton Show.  It's very talk show-y.  I don't get it.  Very late night talk show.  Believe me, your friend Jim Norton I like a lot, but if it's close to someone else,  then I'm not going to do it.  You're a good egg, Noonan.  Yeah.  I wanted to call it...  What if there's another Jim Norton with a show?  Well, there's a Graham Norton with a show, the best talk show on the fucking planet.  And fucking Graham Crackle with a show.  Oh, and fucking Ed Norton.  Holy shit, we're going to go for hours here.  All right, Iraq, why don't you take us to break. 
[01:06:30]  The opening of the show.  I'm sat alone in a boggy marsh.  Totally emotionless except for her heart.  Mud flowed up into love's pajamas.  She totally confused all the passing piranhas.  She's love, she's love, she's in my head.  She's love, she's love, she's love, she might be dead. 
[01:07:00]  Love lingered last in line for brains.  I would imagine Weird Al Yankovic did something with this song, right?  He's Gump.  He's Gump.  Was it Gump?  Yep.  It was Gump.  Far has Gump. 
[01:07:30]  Fucking E-Rock knows Weird Al Yankovic.  E-Rock actually is a fan of Weird Al Yankovic.  Oh.  You are, right, E-Rock?  Yes.  Oh, God.  Why?  Oh, we did this break, too.  Did we?  Well, give me the quick answer again.  I forgot.  Because it's what I grew up with.  Yeah, but I grew up with Dr. Demento, and I appreciate a Weird Al song every once in a while,  but I wasn't all in.  No.  I wasn't all in like you.  You bought his albums, right?  Yep.  Oh.  Oh, no.  My name is Forrest.  He casually remarks. 
[01:08:00]  Ugh.  This is bad.  Hey.  Pockets?  Chocolates?  There it goes.  Why is this head shaved?  Who's he supposed to be there?  This is fucking hilarious.  Pockets, USA?  A little pot, USA?  Oh, a Ruth Buzzy reference in the video?  Good job.  Oh, this song is...  This song is about a Ruth Buzzy from 1994. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, this song is...  Ah, yeah, but Ruth Buzzy is from a TV show from 1968.  But this song, how old is this song now?  90s, yeah.  94, 95, right?  We used to play this in AF.  No, the Gump version I'm talking about.  Oh, the Gump version.  Yeah, same time.  Yeah, all right.  It's a song that Weird Al's doing.  It's about 15 years old easy, if not more.  Bob Kelly in studio.  It's been a while.  Hi, Bobby.  What's up?  What's up, boys?  I'm excited to be here, man. 
[01:09:00]  Are you?  You know, it's weird.  Last time I was here...  Are you?  Good point.  It's dark out now.  Last time I came here, it was light out when I came.  Yeah.  Now it's just...  I woke up this morning like, is my alarm clock wrong?  Like, it's just pitch.  You never get up this early?  You haven't been up this early since it's been dark this early?  Mm-hmm.  It's been this way for like fucking two months?  No, I don't have to.  We get an idea of what Alaska's about because there's probably...  I think we get four to five weeks where when Kenny picks me up, it's light out. 
[01:09:30]  It's like, wow, this is cool, man.  This is different.  But literally only five weeks a year we get that.  Yeah.  Rest of the time, we come here in the dark.  I don't know if I could do that.  It's kind of fucking depressing.  I don't like the whole fucking dark in the morning, dark at night thing.  It's four to five and it's dark.  It's terrible.  It's cold, windy, and dark out.  And all I'm thinking is, if it was summer, I would be out on a lounge chair in the sun  for hours already.  Passed out. 
[01:10:00]  Passed out, of course.  Passed out with a sunburner.  At 4.30 when it gets...  With a little hand on your chest.  At 4.30 when it gets dark, you start settling down for the night.  Like, oh, I guess it's time to like eat dinner and start thinking about bed.  4.30.  I mean, I don't do that, but you know what I mean.  And you're right.  Then you go, wait a minute.  It's dark.  I'm walking home.  It's five o'clock.  I would have at least four more hours in the summer.  Four hours!  And we, as a society, can't figure out that that falling back shit doesn't work anymore.  Fuck that. 
[01:10:30]  Why can't we even...  You know, they want us to figure out the fiscal cliff.  They can't even figure out how to give us more daylight.  Yeah.  We made this time shit up.  Just fucking shift it.  Right.  We could change this.  Yeah.  And the working stiffs, they work nine to five, so they never...  We made this shit up.  We did.  We made this shit up and we could fix it.  But, you know, for the working stiffs that do nine to five, they go home and they can't  go outside and enjoy themselves for a couple hours.  Yeah.  I was just in the room the last week.  They don't do that fucking time. 
[01:11:00]  Nah.  Poor shit.  I get it.  It started because of the farming and all that, you know, back...  Yeah, but who the fuck farms?  Eight people?  Well, that's why...  In America?  Right?  But why do we...  Why...  What's the reasoning now?  No.  That was back in the day...  The reasoning is we can't figure out anything.  You used to have dinner at five.  Yes.  That's right.  There was dinner at five o'clock and you were done.  They would get up early in the morning to do their farming.  Yeah.  And then at night, when it was darker earlier, I guess they'd go into the barn or something 
[01:11:30]  to do that work.  And that's where those big breakfasts came from.  Yeah.  Like, you know, that Grand Slam at Denny's?  19 eggs.  Sausages.  Yeah, sausage, bacon, pancakes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's for farmers, not fat fucks like me who wake up at eight just to get that and then  go back to sleep until four.  What?  Oh, my God.  Really?  What?  Dude, there's nothing worse.  That's the worst.  At a fucking hotel.  When they have the hotel with the free buffet.  Yeah.  That alarm goes, ding, six o'clock.  Get down there and get the first honey bun.  Oh.  I sat at a hotel. 
[01:12:00]  Where the fuck is it?  Chicago?  I don't know where the fuck it is.  They had a pancake machine maker.  Yeah.  Where you push a button and two pancakes.  No.  Listen to me.  Two pancakes.  I've seen this.  And not evenly sized, like perfect little pancakes.  Every pancake is a little different, like a pancake should be.  Right.  Because if the pancake came out and everyone was like the other one, this is fucking evil.  This is not right. 
[01:12:30]  This is robotic shit.  It should never happen that way.  Every pancake comes out.  You hit a button, two pancakes come out.  There it is.  I've seen this.  Holy shit.  I actually had pancakes because of this machine.  I don't like pancakes in general, but I'm like, fuck, I got to try this.  I sat there for two hours explaining to people because they didn't know what it was.  And they'd walk by it.  And I'd go, it's a pancake machine.  You hit the button and pancakes come out.  How many did you have?  I had to have at least eight because I had to help people know what it was.  Nobody would use it.  That shit expands quickly when you eat it. 
[01:13:00]  I can only eat like two pancakes.  It is.  It's like you're eating a sponge.  They're fucking amazing.  Do you like the pancake?  That batter dries.  They're so thin.  I like the Froot Loops dispenser where you just turn the thing and Froot Loops come out  of my house.  Like a gum bun machine?  No, man.  It's a big cylinder filled with Froot Loops.  They have them.  It's just a basic turn the handle and fill up your bowl with Froot Loops.  It's like horse feet when you go to a petting zoo.  You got to keep your hand flat when your feet.  Yeah, or your mouth open underneath it.  I don't have it figured out, though, because it crunches up some of the Froot Loops. 
[01:13:30]  A little bit at the end.  A little bit.  They have them in the airport lounges with pretzels and peels.  The way in size!  Where is this happening, this pancake machine?  I want one from my house so bad.  Most motels at this point.  Really?  Or hotels.  Like the hotels with the continental breakfast?  Holiday Inn Expresses.  Yeah.  Hampton Inn.  Those type of places have the pancake machine.  Yeah, they have one little fucking Guatemalan lady.  And she runs the whole thing.  Really?  It's spotless.  She takes her job very seriously.  I bet she runs the whole fucking show. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, let's do the whole fucking pancake and village.  They don't run out of the whole milk when you need it for your Froot Loops, right, Bobby?  She's right there fucking replacing everything.  You ever see a syrup container come apart like that?  Holy shit.  Yeah, she probably did Captain Crunch and Toucan Sam.  Let's do it for Mrs. Butterworth and Aunt Jemima.  Let's do it for Snap and Crackle.  Yeah, what's their whole platoon of cereal or something? 
[01:14:30]  Fucking A, Chip.  Fucking hate you.  What do you say, Chip?  Oh, it's about a platoon of cereal.  Why wouldn't you have one of these?  If you're a multi-millionaire, just a fucking millionaire.  You got more than two million in the bank, you should have this.  Pancake machine?  It should be in your kitchen like a coffee maker.  Who only has two million in the bank?  Oh, man.  Really?  Oh, my God, dude.  That feeling, let me tell you something about the feeling you have that I don't have.  Oh, it was just a joke.  What's that, in your feet?  That was just a joke, Bobby. 
[01:15:00]  Just a joke, Bobby.  Not shortness of breath?  Actually, I got something to tell you, guys.  Oh, no.  No, I'm kidding.  Don't chatter me.  Everyone's eyes open up.  Don't read into it.  It was just a joke, Bobby.  You have more than two million in the bank.  Oh, my God.  What a great feeling that is.  Just a joke.  You guys are all fucking loaded.  It's better than one million.  That's for sure.  You have one million?  No, I said it's better than one million.  I have two million.  Oh, you have two million?  I'm not loaded.  You have thousands.  You're a thousandaire.  Thousandaire. 
[01:15:30]  I'm a fucking hundredaire.  Oh.  Oh, Bobby.  Jeez.  That's not bad.  You're all right, though.  You're paying your bills.  Still better than every, pretty much, except for you guys.  Everybody on this floor.  There you go.  You're paying your bills.  How is Aruba?  This is the best place on Earth.  Aruba!  Everyone says it, but what about the windy part?  What windy part?  Everyone talks about the windy part.  There's no, the wind.  They say there's a windy part of Aruba if you're on that part, it's miserable, but if you've  picked the right side where there's no wind, you're good. 
[01:16:00]  You have no choice.  What do you mean?  One side of the island where the ocean, the Atlantic Ocean hits, is the windy part, and  nobody lives on that island except for a couple of fishermen in huts made out of fucking  So you don't really go to the ocean?  Oh.  No, the ocean side is the Caribbean Sea side, and that's where all the hotels and everything  are.  And it's white sands, and it's beautiful.  Look, you can see.  Oh, so why do people, so why do they talk about the windy part all the time? 
[01:16:30]  That side of the island, which you can go on, it's like a national park, you can rent  the four-wheel fucking vehicle.  And I went on that this time, all these little roads, I went all up these roads, and they have  all ruins and caves and shit you can go in.  So they're not roads, they're paths.  Yeah, you need like a four-wheel drive.  Yeah.  I love, you see, sometimes you see tourists in their little fucking Uri, little tiny,  those little European Uri cars.  Oh, those cars, yeah.  Yeah, little tiny golf cart wheels, and they're on that side of the island, and they're just 
[01:17:00]  fucking stuck.  Holy shit, and then all of a sudden there's a fucking housing development with a golf course.  Do they have a little town in Aruba?  Yeah, they got a bunch of little towns.  They got malls and all that shit.  No, I mean a town where you walk, and it has a little, like, maybe it has a little fudge  store.  Oh, yeah, they got two of them.  They got actually three of them.  A little coffee shop, a couple nice restaurants, a place to have a few beers.  Downtown.  A little shopping.  Where I used to stay, at the Renaissance, they have a private island that you go out to  in the morning, there's a boat that just ships you back and forth. 
[01:17:30]  It's a 10-minute ride, and it's a private island.  Why is that better than just going on the beach?  Because it looks like the beaches are nice.  Ah, the beaches are great.  Are they crowded?  No, nothing.  That's why I like the Turks and Caicos.  The beaches aren't crowded yet, and they don't have the people marching up and down trying  to sell you shit yet.  No, they don't have any of that here.  Oh, good.  I hate that shit.  There's no, yeah, like, fucking Bahamas.  Nothing better than trying to lay down on the beach and get a little relaxation.  You're on the beach, and it's like, braids, braids, shirt, kerchief, kerchief. 
[01:18:00]  Fuck, shut up.  I'm sleeping.  You didn't want to be talked to?  Not at all.  Except for the guy with the drinks in the coconut.  Love that guy.  I was right here.  I want a sweet coconut drink, like coconut with, like, a little bit of Coca-Cola in it.  Really?  No.  Coconut drinks are great, though.  So you can't have alcohol.  I know.  That's the only time you could really have coconut is with an alcohol drink.  Alcohol.  Alcohol is overrated.  Aruba is a shit.  You can't fuck with Aruba.  I want to go there now.  Yeah, me too.  It's so, it's so, it's not as cheap as, I mean, it's expensive because it's Dutch and 
[01:18:30]  all that shit.  They fucking charge you and I'm like, but it's not, to New Yorkers, it's not expensive.  You stay in a nice place?  Ah, I fucking stay.  In all the places.  They redid all the places, so all the, even the, we stay at this, like, boutique place,  I mean, Chibo Bay or some shit, whatever the fuck it's called, and all the rooms are  redone with the nice beds.  It's not that flat mattress.  I hate that.  With that shitty flower pattern.  It's like a wrestling mat.  Yeah, a wicker chair.  Fuck off.  You know, it's like antique furniture.  It's all brand new plasma screens, walk-in showers. 
[01:19:00]  It's great.  I hate a wicker chair.  Ugh, I hate wicker.  I hate wicker.  I don't mind it to sit.  Rattan.  It's rattan.  If it's made properly, it's a nice, it's a nice, uh, rest.  Do you have wicker?  Uh-oh.  What?  Do you have wicker in your house?  No.  See, it never fits.  When I go to these places, it never fits in a house.  It never fits in a nice wicker chair.  Although that wicker chair seems a bit out of place.  I have a wicker hanging chair in my apartment.  It's in the middle of my apartment.  Yes, I just hang there and I sit in my wicker and I read.  No, you don't.  Star magazine. 
[01:19:30]  Thank God you don't.  Star magazine.  What are you doing in Aruba?  Just chill out?  Yeah.  This is why I love going there, too.  We've been there fucking 18 times.  So all that Magellan shit that women like to do.  We gotta go here.  We got my friend told me to go.  Thank God.  It's all over.  It's over.  We wake up.  Now you relax like you belong there.  Well, the only stressful part is you gotta plant, you claim every morning with your fucking  towels.  You're palapa.  What's a palapa?  Yeah, you're on, you know, the big thing you gotta lie in there.  Is that what you were just doing in the bathroom? 
[01:20:00]  You gotta go out at like 6.30, put your towels down on a lounge chair before that fucking  French douchebag comes out.  Yeah.  Is it crowded?  No, it's not crowded, but you want up front right near the ocean.  You want the best little umbrella and you gotta wake up real early.  Oh, fuck that.  And then once you wake up early, that guy will wake up earlier.  And then he'll, so you gotta kind of keep getting up.  Yeah.  But, um, or give the, give the towel boy.  Well, because the hours I keep, I'm the one first on the beach and I, uh, put my shoes 
[01:20:30]  and my book and everything I can to, you know, get the proper chairs.  Yeah.  In the prime spot.  Yeah, because what happens is everybody kind of gets their own umbrella and that's your  umbrella for the week, but then somebody new comes in and wakes up earlier and takes somebody's  umbrella.  Right.  And that fucks up everything.  And then we gotta go over here and those fat lesbians have to move back one.  And then that fucking shitty couple from the Netherlands has to move on.  Now you've fucked up everybody's vacation.  You know how pathetic, I'm the first one up in a resort. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  And they don't even have the coffee made.  You know how they kind of have those like, uh, poolside, you know, breakfast thingies.  And I'm there waiting for the fucking coffee.  They get so annoyed.  The sun's not even up when I wake up.  Yeah.  I get, I'd rather get up really early, watch the sun come up and all that shit, have coffee,  take a walk on the beach.  No one the fuck is around.  And then when it gets really hot, that's when I go in and chill out for a couple hours.  You go in the place.  I go, I go take a nap.  Really?  Fuck yeah.  And then I come back out and get the rest of the day in.  I woke up early every day.  I woke up at 637 and I stayed up all day on the beach. 
[01:21:30]  What's that?  You're making a joke and how precise the time was that you woke up, 637.  637.  It's fucking, bro.  It's very precise.  I don't understand the people that sleep in.  My God.  That's the best part of the day when you're on one of those islands.  How does your brain work that fast to put that joke together?  It just does.  Oh, Jesus.  Chips stinks.  637.  If you're out partying, though, it's hard to get up early even when you're at a, no, 
[01:22:00]  I mean, but if you're, if you are, I've been to Aruba.  Oh, yeah?  I love it.  Yes.  The fucking little casinos that you'd be crazy.  I love it.  Yes.  Nobody gambles.  Everybody's on penny slots except for you at a fucking table with $20,000.  And it's ruining everyone's, everyone's having good natured time and he's screaming,  fucking hit me!  They're like, what's wrong with this guy?  We're supposed to be having fun.  Racial epithets at the table.  Did you go to the Creepery?  No.  Someone's telling me, great restaurants, candy shops, oh, it's Mentality Magazine on Twitter. 
[01:22:30]  Oh.  And the Creepery.  I didn't go there.  Those Creepery places stink.  I don't like crepes.  And then they, what, fancied up with some fucking fudge or-  Yeah, fucking Nutella.  Nutella, right?  Nutella and a fucking-  Nutella is so overrated, by the way.  Let's not get carried away.  You like the Nutella, huh?  It's chocolate in a can.  Yeah, there's better chocolate to get out there.  There's chocolate you can put on bread.  Chocolate for breakfast.  For some reason, it's okay.  I'm not going to lie.  The fattest guy in the room is going, fuck Nutella, no.  All right, chocolate you can put on a sandwich. 
[01:23:00]  It's all right.  It's shit.  I'm in.  Did you have fun?  Did you, were you a good boy or a bad boy?  Did you eat okay in a room?  I worked out, we worked out every day.  Good, you did.  And then we, we, I mean, I fucked off a little bit.  We, but here's the thing, we woke up every day early.  We went to bed at like, we went to bed at 9.30 one night.  Ugh.  That's late.  Listen, I was so tired.  We woke up at six, went, worked out.  And then, I mean, going in the water and doing all that shit that makes you tired. 
[01:23:30]  Then we went snorkeling and then went to dinner at 9.30.  No, snoop it, dude.  Snoop, no, no, I'm not a snoopering.  Not snoopering.  Snoopering.  I don't even do that, I don't do, that's what, I don't do those tour shit things anymore.  I love, we just, you can drive.  Bobby's fads.  Bob goes through fads.  I know, you get a solo and Bob with your fads and then you blow it off.  This is the best thing.  You're going to love it.  And then you talk to him a month later, he's like, ah, I haven't done that.  Fuck that.  That sucks.  Yeah, I don't snoop.  I just go on the iPhone.  I got the app to snoop.  Oh, now he's got, um. 
[01:24:00]  What is that?  I hope.  It's a charger.  What is this?  Headphone fucking.  You know what?  Little yo-yo.  That's a little gadget.  What is it?  I hate the headphones, how you put them in your pocket.  And they tangle, Bob.  And they tangle.  And I hate it.  Me too.  What do you do?  Now I bought this.  What do you do?  It's like a little thing of floss.  All you do is pull it out.  Like you're pulling floss out, but it's your headphones.  And then you just unhook that, and then you use your headphones, and then fold them in  half when you're done, and you pull it down, and boom.  All right, what happens?  Come on, son.  What happens?  I just don't like carrying shit around. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, but look at that.  That's my problem.  That goes right in your pocket.  Bobby, what happens if it booms after you take it off?  What do you think?  Boom.  You don't boom after you take it off.  It tangles.  No.  Oh, what do you mean?  What if you take it off, and then it spools up on you?  It spools up after you take it off?  Yeah.  It doesn't do that.  It could.  It could in a bad world.  Well, then how do you fix it?  That's a fucking problem.  I don't want you to be positive.  That's a problem.  It's amazing how annoyed I get when my fucking headphones are tangled.  Someone is a millionaire because they came up with that. 
[01:25:00]  Well, I'm going to sell one unit.  Yeah.  Now, what happens if it goes...  It's called a recoil.  Can I see the recoil?  What happens if it goes...  No.  Can I see it?  No, you can't touch anything that can be broken.  Do you think...  I'm on here promoting...  I don't know you.  Like, I've never met you.  Why?  What happened?  You think the beard disguises your shittiness?  What happened?  I just want to see the recoiler.  Bobby, make it recoil without the headphones on.  Don't do that.  What will happen?  Why would you do that?  That's a fucking flaw, then.  I hope that you accidentally put that in. 
[01:25:30]  Why did you just turn into a fucking Yenta from Long Island?  That's a fucking flaw.  That's a flaw.  That's a flaw, Bobby.  Oh, I don't like when it recoils like that.  It gets all tangled.  It frightens me.  It makes a snapping noise.  I bought one for my friend, and it recoiled in her pocket in church.  She had to throw it away.  Yeah, her lipstick was ruined.  It recoiled, and it snapped the edge of the lipstick off all over Dolores' purse.  It got caught in a charm brace that her wrist broke.  She has osteoporosis, and her wrist broke. 
[01:26:00]  All tangled.  You're tangled.  Not really.  My cord's always tangled.  You ever wear the headphones all tangled?  No, because it touches me.  It's like fucking wrapped around your neck like it's choking you.  It tickles my cheeks and neck.  It makes me crazy.  I'm already done.  Look, see, I'm done now, too.  I'm done, though.  I'm done.  No, no.  From the man that brought you the fucking bandolier.  From the man who brought the bandolier, the BBP bag.  Right.  I've got a new bag, too, but actually, it's the best.  Do you know what your fucking reality show should be? 
[01:26:30]  Gadget Zilch.  That's a great fucking name.  That is a good name.  It's a great idea for a show, too.  Gadget Zilch.  I ain't giving you my fucking headphones.  What do you think?  I was born yesterday, too.  Dude, I don't fucking break technology.  You sure?  Bobby, will she show you how I am?  You sure?  I don't fuck with break technology.  I love technology.  No, I mean, the Samsung S3 headphones, they're making it with some other shit where it doesn't  tangle as much.  It tanges a little bit.  It's a cord, yeah.  Let me see.  I have the Bose ones.  I don't trust you.  I'm not stupid.  I don't like Bose.  Hey, what happened to the Bandolier?  You done with that?  No, I still got it. 
[01:27:00]  What's your new bag?  The new bag is it has, you can charge up to four devices in it.  Oh.  And it charges, you can charge your iPhone four times.  Bobby.  What?  This is the show you should be pitching.  What?  Yeah.  Trying out all new gadgets.  Yeah.  I would watch this show.  I.  Because you find shit no one knows about yet.  I don't know about this fucking.  It's the best bag ever.  That phone thing you're talking about.  You travel, you forget, your phone dies, you just plug it into your bag.  And just how you work things like that, and then you do this, and boom.  Oh, this is the best.  You want one of these? 
[01:27:30]  I'll get you one for Christmas.  No, but the problem is then it's more shit you got to carry around.  This.  No, I don't.  Wow.  That was just mean.  That was just mean.  If you acted like that in your audition yesterday, you would have got the part.  That was really good.  So Aruba was good.  Aruba's the best.  You have a 10-day.  I miss Bob.  It's all New York and Boston, people.  Where do I go?  Those flatbacks.  Maybe I go to Aruba this year with two kids.  Holy fuck.  If you're like me, I like boutique hotels that mainly adults stay at, or there's some kids. 
[01:28:00]  Or you want to stay where all the fucking kids and families.  Or do you like Keith Robinson, a five-star hotel motherfucker.  He's right.  I agree with Keith.  Yeah, I don't like that, though.  Five-star, you get to go walk through this fucking hotel, go in an elevator up here, walk  down a fucking ice-cold hallway.  Ice-cold hallway?  Yeah.  Yeah, who watched that in the fucking summer?  No.  They fucking don't know how to do AC right.  They don't do AC right, man.  You freeze your fucking balls off. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, dude.  The corner of your mouth has white fucking snowflakes on it by the time you get back.  I want a nice fucking five-star hotel.  Yeah, but you don't go out.  Like, we were in Brazil.  You came out when the sun went down, like fucking Count Dracula.  Fucking white shins and an Aussie shirt.  So, of course, the five-star hotel room was nice.  He didn't even bring fucking swim trucks.  He brought fucking just jean shorts and would show up as the sun went behind the favelas.  Fucking ghoul would come out.  I want a nice five-star.  I want a gentleman's hotel. 
[01:29:00]  Mr. Norton, may we help you?  Yes, I'd like to have some Caesar salad delivered to my room, please.  But if you're on an island, you want to check out the island, don't you?  I could do both.  I'm going to check out the island.  Where are you going?  Back to my five-star hotel.  Then where?  Back out to the island.  Then where?  Back to my five-star hotel.  Then you would hate Club Med because Club Med was all about...  They showed me my room.  This is years ago.  And I'm like, where's the fucking TV?  Oh, we don't believe in TVs at Club Med because we want you to socialize.  And be out of your room.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  That's too much.  Yeah, Club Med stinks.  That's too much because no matter what, at the end of a long day, you want to turn that fucking TV on.  Club Med is for guys who wear sweatbands around the top of their head.  Yep.  You know what I mean?  I'm trying to pick one of that.  Those fucking idiots.  Actually, I liked Club Med.  Oh, it stinks.  I didn't like the room.  The room was horrible.  It was horrible sleep.  It was all like cinder blocks.  There was no...  Do you remember the song?  Everything sweated.  Your wallet even sweated.  Do you remember the song?  A Club Med Vacation.  The antidote for civilization. 
[01:30:00]  I do remember that one, yes.  How the fuck do you remember that?  I like being in a room where you walk out and you step out of the back door and you're in sand.  Yeah.  And there's the beach.  That's what I like.  I don't like fucking walking through a lobby.  You've got to walk 20 miles.  It takes 20 minutes to get to your fucking stupid lounge chair.  Yeah, who wants a lobby?  Why would you want a lobby?  I love a lobby.  Why?  I like a good lobby.  I love a lobby.  See, it's different than when you're on an island.  No, it's not.  It really is.  I am on an island. 
[01:30:30]  That shit rules if you're in Philadelphia or something.  I want a lobby everywhere.  They don't call me Lobby Jim for nothing.  Yeah.  Where's Jim?  In the lobby.  Where else?  It takes fucking forever to get to the fucking beach.  Good.  I like a nice, slow trip.  The elevator stops at every floor.  It's like, I just want to be on the sand.  I'm fucking the Griswold, too.  I buy every float, every stupid thing at this.  Really?  I get these little pillows for your chair that keep your towel on. 
[01:31:00]  It says, I love Aruba.  That's why you should do a gadget show.  My wife hates me.  Me walking to the beach, I have the floats.  I got the noodles.  I got the pillows.  Just a colorful, fat fuck.  Walking to a chair.  You really do just say, Taurus.  Bobby's a Taurus.  Yes.  Oh my God, you don't even know.  The ugly American Taurus.  Inner tube around your waist.  Europeans, they come out with a towel, a pack of cigarettes. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  And their sunglasses.  And a book.  And a hatred of Jews.  And a fucking book.  Yeah, exactly.  And a fuck, yeah.  They don't know how to enjoy themselves, Bobby?  No, they do.  As Americans, we have to have every...  You can tell the Boston and New York,  they have fucking floaties and all this coolers,  and they're making sandwiches on the beach.  They're smoking.  That's how we go to the beach.  Europeans.  Right.  Fucking towel and a book.  And that's it all day.  Fuck them.  Because they're used to having nothing and being bombed in a blitzkrieg.  We like fucking gentlemanly comforts. 
[01:32:00]  Yes.  Hey, where's your cooler?  I'm going to wait six hours to have some water.  Asshole.  Bring your own shit.  Yeah, like Bob.  Bring all your shit, your gadgets.  Bob brings his fucking computer on the beach.  And my iPad and my iPhone.  Yeah, why wouldn't you?  You can't see your iPad on a beach.  Yeah, you can.  It's all fucking glary.  Yeah, you need sand on it.  What are you fucking Kindle supporters?  It's all glary.  Yeah, you can.  You put it up bright, and then you fucking get under the polapa.  You put the towel over your head and fucking make a dark room for yourself. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Oh, you can see it.  No, you can't.  I did it.  Stop it.  I did it.  No, you didn't.  Do you read it?  Didn't I?  Oh, my God.  Do you read a good book on vacation?  I have to read some books now, so.  Really?  Why?  I just don't.  Bob has to read some books.  That's great.  Avenue Q eyebrows.  What is that?  That's you on the beach.  I'd buy that.  That's you and your iPad on the beach.  I think I bought that.  That's somebody. 
[01:33:00]  I think I bought that hoodie.  Looking at a fucking screen on a computer with a cone kind of dark room thing over it.  Big sock almost.  Yeah, it's a sock.  You can see the computer.  Go for him.  I like it.  Well, you've never been to.  No, but I.  You don't go on vacation.  No, but I.  At all.  It's hard with the radio show.  Why?  We go on vacation.  No, but I mean.  What do you do while we're in a Caribbean island?  It's just hard to.  I love that.  Oh, yeah.  I hit an island every year.  As soon as he said that, I go, I looked at you two. 
[01:33:30]  I'm like, wait a minute.  That's right.  Yeah.  No, but we don't plan vacation that far in advance, and a lot of times one will go while  the other stays.  I plan my trip last minute and always get a good fucking situation.  I don't have anyone to go with.  I'll go with you.  You don't need anyone.  I would like to go.  I would like to bring me.  Just go and chill out.  Well, I'll go.  I'll fucking go.  Go to Aruba.  We'll get on JetBlue.  Fucking direct flight.  How many hours?  17.  Yeah, that's a little.  I want to go to.  It's four hours.  I want to go to fucking Dubai.  I don't want to go there. 
[01:34:00]  Nah.  Fucking life.  I have an invite to go to Dubai.  I do want to go there, but I don't want to go there for a fucking vacation.  I want to go on a tropical vacation where I don't have to worry about getting my head  cut off.  Oh, that's true.  Look at a bunch of chicks on the beach with nothing, just covered.  Oh, wait.  Aruba, do they go topless?  Yeah, it's kind of weird.  I mean, there's just tits everywhere.  Oh, Jesus.  There's just titties everywhere.  I'm not going to.  So that's great.  I'm not even going to say anything.  So that's great.  What's wrong with that?  That one's too easy.  I know. 
[01:34:30]  That's why I've done it.  It's just, yeah.  There's just tits everywhere.  And that's the problem?  Well, they're not great tits.  It's not like it's fucking fantastic titties.  You realize there's a lot of bad tits out there.  There's a lot of bad tits.  But they don't, Europeans don't care about their bad titties.  No, they don't care about their fucking fat asses.  They don't care about hair.  The guys don't care that they're fucking wearing that marble bag fucking dick.  The pubic hair flying out the sides of it.  Oh, God.  I bought five of those.  No, you didn't.  I did. 
[01:35:00]  And we got to Aruba.  Sewed them together.  All right.  I'm just kidding.  All right.  Stop.  All right.  Get off me.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, she threw them out before we got there.  She threw them out as.  Why would you buy five?  You have to buy a lot of everything, right?  I want, yeah.  I bought every color.  That's what you do when you like something.  I'm just asking.  If you're black, what the fuck are you talking about?  I don't buy time.  Well, they do.  I need that in every color.  Or if you're Arthur.  Right.  That's true.  Arthur.  That's his accent.  Who?  I'm sticking it for Bobby. 
[01:35:30]  That was his Boston accent.  Say it again, Bobby.  Arthur.  Arthur.  I said Arthur.  No, now he's trying to fix it.  Yeah, now you're fucking me up.  It's Arthur.  Now you may be insecure.  Arthur.  No, it's Arthur.  Arthur.  It's Arthur.  All right.  We're going to break.  Have you seen Perry's wife?  Yeah, I know.  Don't you hate Perry's wife?  He's going to take the knife out of the cheese.  Bobby, what are you promoting?  We've got to take a break here.  We're at T'Nitum at Stanhope House in Stanhope, New Jersey.  It's a new club.  You working with Doug? 
[01:36:00]  Oh, boy.  Where's Stanhope House?  Stanhope, New Jersey.  Oh, there's a Stanhope, New Jersey.  Right next to Sithope.  Or Stan, give it all up.  Hope, hope.  And then tomorrow night I'm at...  Terrible.  It's the worst.  Orid.  Sometimes they're good, though.  No.  Tomorrow night I'm at Uncle Vinny's in Point Pleasant.  Oh, yeah.  Which is...  Who was just in here?  Oh, Foot played it.  Yes.  Who?  Joe Curry.  Joe Curry.  Plank Foot, my friend. 
[01:36:30]  We call him Plank Foot.  Right.  Everyone knows him as Joe Curry.  We call him Plank Foot because he was tapping his foot in a barn one day when we were all  drinking whiskey and smoking marijuana cigarettes.  And he was tapping his foot to some Charlie Daniels music.  And as he tapped his foot, which he has got giant feet, dust was swirling off the floor  around his foot, like in a vortices, like you dropped a plank and it hits the floor and  the dust goes, whoosh.  So we called him Plank Foot. 
[01:37:00]  So we had...  This name stuck since 1977.  What a great storyteller you are.  You're a fucking great storyteller.  I try.  Oh, my God.  You should talk to children.  Oh, wait a minute.  He does.  Oh, God.  Much to the chagrin of the police.  Sure.  Sure.  Bobby, can you tell another story today?  Storytelling with Bob Kelly.  Oh, God.  You got maybe a scenario later today?  Yeah, maybe later tonight.  We can always tell a story to the kids.  It has to be different than the other one, though.  The other one was a cabin in the woods and it was snowing and all that. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, no, we could talk about Aruba.  I mean, it's a...  Maybe a beach scenario.  A little storytelling at the beach.  We can work it out.  All right.  But yeah, this weekend.  Tonight, Stan Hope House.  Tomorrow, Uncle Vinny's in Point Pleasant.  So go to my website, robertkellerlive.com, for the tickets and availabilities.  Series XM.  Series XM.  The O.P.  R3 Show.  Aruba.  Jamaica.  Ooh, I want to take it.  Bermuda.  Bahama.  Come on, pretty mama. 
[01:38:00]  Key Largo.  Montego.  Bob Kelly in studio.  It's Friday.  We played this for you, Bobby.  All right.  Kokomo.  Bringing you back to Aruba.  I have only one part of the song I like.  What part?  The Aruba.  All the other places suck.  You'll get beheaded and your wife will get raped.  Fucking, they'll just smell marijuana on her pussy.  That's part of the pitch.  Oh, my God.  Man, she smells like marijuana.  The pussy smells like marijuana.  Gange, man. 
[01:38:30]  I hear you got to be careful in Jamaica.  Yeah, you can't leave the fucking...  That's why I hate these places.  Yeah, Nassau, Bahamas.  You got to be a little careful.  You can't leave.  Going from the airport to the resort is always a treat, looking at all the tin shacks and poverty.  And you realize, oh, boy, if I got let out here, I'd probably die.  Aruba has that, too.  But you don't have to...  They're not fucking killing people.  Opie, promise I'll get you in a...  I can't even read his writing this year. 
[01:39:00]  What is this?  Matt Paxton.  Oh, it's Matt Paxton.  I'm sorry.  Matt Paxton's Happy Holidays, Five Decisions Away, Golden Poop Ornament.  Hey, he chickened out a little bit because his poo looks like a Christmas tree.  Let's be honest with each other.  Does that look like poo?  Well, it looks like a nice soft serve shit.  My poo looks like fucking a bunch of little cockroaches.  Whatever lump I have in my asshole that mushes my poo. 
[01:39:30]  What?  Makes it flat.  This is today's plug-all, I guess.  What do you have, a Play-Doh Fun Factory tumor in your ass?  Comes out shaped like a star?  I haven't had a fucking nice fucking missile poo.  Why?  I don't know.  What do you mean?  Missile poo.  I shit three times a day.  I'm great.  It just comes out all broken up and shit.  Yeah.  Now that the seawater's been in me, it's all like fucking white.  When was the last time you had a poo where you technically didn't have to wipe? 
[01:40:00]  Wow.  Where you go for the wipe and go, holy fuck, this rules.  When I was one.  Really?  How are you guys eating?  I don't.  I haven't had that in a long time.  What the fuck?  Jimmy just farted, but he did like a fucking fist pump.  He did come through.  He did like when a hockey player scores and they put their skate up and pull their fist  back.  That's what Jimmy did while he farted.  That's hockey, though.  We don't know.  Oh, what's that?  What is hockey?  We don't know.  We don't know what's going on.  Danny's wearing my hat. 
[01:40:30]  Oh.  The hat.  The fucking hat.  Is this Jimmy?  Okay.  Wow.  Does it smell?  Yeah.  A little bit.  I kind of smell it.  I don't want to smell it.  So, Matt Paxton, thank you for the ornament.  Yes.  The duty ornament, yes.  He was bragging about the duty ornament, but it turns out it looks too much like a Christmas  tree.  I would have went all in.  How do you make it look more like shit?  Like make it look like shit.  Yeah.  How?  Like you make it look like a turd.  You know what made it look like?  The tip.  The tip.  The tip.  The tip on the top. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, you know what you'd have to do to make a shit look like that?  Right.  You got to move your hips.  He wasn't brave enough to go all in, so he wants people to think it's an actual Christmas  tree.  Yeah, maybe.  That's all.  But thank you.  He's trying to sell a few, you know?  Thank you.  I'll put it on my tree with pride next to the ornaments the other listeners and whatnot  have sent.  Yeah, I'll put that on my tree.  What's wrong with you?  What?  I got it.  Did you get a tree, Anthony? 
[01:41:30]  I have...  He's all in.  I have one, two, three, four, five trees in my house.  Right now?  Right now.  Regular Christmas trees?  Regular size.  One is giant in the living room.  Any personalized ornaments, though?  It's like fucking 15 feet tall.  And then the other ones are standard size trees.  Any personalized ornaments on it?  No, but I did get...  Or is it all...  No, they're pretty much your generic ornaments.  But I did get a listener that sent me some authentic late 1930s German ornaments. 
[01:42:00]  Were they fucking earlobes?  No.  Teeth?  Instead of stringing popcorn and stringing teeth?  He's got a bunch of luggage handles and a fucking...  I got a tree, Bobby.  Boy, you got a fake one or a real one?  You love gadgets.  Oh my God, yes.  You can appreciate my fucking tree.  The clap on, clap off?  Oh no.  What?  It's the snowing Christmas tree.  What's that mean?  It actually snows.  Shut the fuck up. 
[01:42:30]  I know you're in.  It's...  I know you're in.  You'll love it.  Show them the snowing Christmas tree.  It's hilarious.  And I got it.  And my two and a half year old has decided that it's way more fun to take all the fake  fucking snow and throw it around the apartment.  I knew that would happen.  Did you set it up yesterday?  Oh yeah.  How'd it go?  I got a video...  What does your 16 and a half year old think about your trees?  Bobby?  Now, here's the snowing Christmas tree.  Fucking Eggers fingernails.  Look, look.  Look.  He does.  God, I hate him. 
[01:43:00]  It's terrible.  There it is, Bobby.  The snowing Christmas tree.  Comes out like a sprinkler on top, I understand.  But then look.  It's snowing.  Where does this fucking stupid snow go?  Look.  Into a big fucking collector.  Into an umbrella at the bottom.  And then it goes back into the tree.  Now, is it a vacuum thing or an auger?  Look at Bobby's face.  He kind of likes it.  Oh, Bobby loves a gadget.  Where do you put the presents?  Around the tree, I guess.  Oh, you gotta get another tree.  I'm gonna have another tree.  This is like a goof tree.  You can't have a cat. 
[01:43:30]  Like, if you have a cat with that, no.  Oh my God, they're gonna shit.  Shit comes spraying on the top of your tree.  That'd be hilarious.  The cat shits in it.  It gets picked up and just sprays shit.  That's true.  You can't have a cat.  You can't have a two and a half year old, I realize.  He decides he wants to fucking play in the fake snow and throw it around the house.  You can put trees under that, Bobby.  You put gifts under it.  No, not little trees.  You put gifts under it.  Yeah, look.  There's a little gifts.  You can do that.  Yeah, you got a fucking animal.  That thing's gonna go, you're just screw...  You're gonna fucking see him just...  Bobby.  Imagine if you had a pet monkey. 
[01:44:00]  Let's be honest.  You kind of like it.  You kind of like it.  I do.  You kind of like it.  This is...  Is that a...  That the tree comes with it.  That's not something you put on...  No, no.  What do you think?  You hollow the trunk out?  Yeah, I know.  You make those things individually, the snowflakes, out of granite.  It's kind of good, right?  Bobby, is it a vacuum-y type thing?  Airflow?  Or is it a machine that augers the shit up?  I have no idea.  No?  Who got it?  You or your wife?  I actually...  I kind of saw it in the store window, and my wife said, you know what? 
[01:44:30]  I'm gonna make him happy.  And she fucking ordered it.  I wasn't actually gonna buy it.  Then you saw the Corleone gunned down headline in the paper.  Look at that.  Look.  It's snowing in your house.  How festive is that?  Okay, let me ask you a question.  Does it make a noise?  I imagine it's not.  No noise.  It's gotta be...  That's what you hear.  That's a fucking noise.  Oh, my God.  Well, you could go either music or no music.  I usually go no music.  That music stinks.  But you could go music.  It goes...  You hear the sound?  That's what rape victims hear in their head while they're being raped. 
[01:45:00]  Is that what you heard, Bobby?  Listen to the sound.  It sounds like it's snowing outside.  That's all you get.  How festive.  That's actually a nice...  That's pretty badass.  It is.  And then the branches all have snow on them.  I kind of like it.  That's pretty nice.  I know you like it.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  I don't get that.  This is made for you, Bobby.  Not so much for me and a two-and-a-half-year-old.  I don't like the big umbrella underneath.  I wish that was a little smaller.  Or it looked a little different than an umbrella.  It's literally an umbrella. 
[01:45:30]  I don't know.  You can hang some shit.  Yeah.  You can fucking figure it out to make it look cooler.  It looks like a prototype because it's an umbrella.  It looks like the prototype the guy made in the garage before you went on the show.  Now, what we're planning on having for the bottom is a container unit.  For right now, I use this umbrella from Costco because it serves the purpose.  And they mean well, but you do get snow everywhere else, too.  It's not just going into the umbrella.  Yeah.  It's got to bounce off of shit.  I got fake snow all over my house.  I've had it for two hours.  Oh, God. 
[01:46:00]  Before he went to bed last night.  You got to make sure.  There's snow everywhere, right?  Because if he eats that.  I eat it.  Is it?  Is it?  I put mustard on.  I eat that fucking shit.  He's good as far as not eating shit like that.  He's good so far.  So, I don't know.  I like it.  I'd get it.  Yeah?  I'd get it.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  It looks great.  How great is that?  It really is festive.  You can't fuck with that.  It's snowing inside.  You got the snowflakes, boom.  They go up, boom.  Dude, they come out.  They go all over you. 
[01:46:30]  You got your presents, dude.  You got your plug.  Dude, you got your Christmas music.  Boom.  It's snowing inside, dude.  It's like a Christmas at the Kellys.  Dude, you put your hat, your mittens on.  You feel like you're outside.  You try to sweep it up.  It goes whoosh all over because it's so light, dude.  They need to figure out something where it snows from your ceiling, though,  instead of coming out like a sprinkler at the top.  They have it.  It's called poverty.  Ah, poor people.  But they'll figure that out.  Yeah, I get it. 
[01:47:00]  Snow from the ceiling.  That wouldn't rule.  How could you get it?  Because it kind of comes out like a sprinkler head at the top there where the star goes.  The only thing I don't like is the amount of snow in the bottom and the umbrella.  The bottom.  Fix the fucking umbrella and the bottom, and I'm good.  How are you going to catch the snow if you don't have an umbrella?  Come on, son.  You fucking made a tree that snows.  You can't figure out the last part that stinks?  I got a snowing tree in my house.  They need to drape some shit around the umbrella so it doesn't look like an umbrella.  You're right.  Yeah.  You're right.  Oh, you know what? 
[01:47:30]  Put some fake Christmas packages around there.  There you go, Bobby.  You're thinking.  Right.  Well, you can put the presents inside the snow.  Let the presents get snow on.  Ah, the weather outside.  It's frightful.  Fire's so delightful, too, I hear.  I don't know that song.  I was going to get one of those Rombas, those robot vacuum cleaners.  It's a Roomba.  And my friend.  What is it?  My friend got one.  He goes, you have dogs.  You can't get one.  I go, why?  He goes, if my cat shit in the kitchen, I came home and that Romba spread cat shit. 
[01:48:00]  Smeared it everywhere.  Smeared it all over the kitchen floor.  So it smeared a layer of thin cat shit all over the kitchen floor.  Wow.  So his floor is like brown instead of white.  That's crazy.  That shit doesn't look like it works properly.  No, they haven't figured that out yet.  Nah.  Yeah, just hire someone.  I can't wait for a fucking robot.  A real one.  Just have a friend.  Like Rosie from the Jetsons.  She pushes a vacuum around.  We don't really talk about it on our show.  Do you watch the Shark Tank? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  With all the fucking inventions they're coming up with?  Holy fuck, it's a great show.  It's pretty cool.  It's on Friday nights, right?  Yeah.  I want to see.  It's a little kid riding a Rumba.  Ah, that's adorable.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at that toe just about to be lopped off.  Yeah, yeah.  No kidding.  Yeah, it's fucking awful.  Hitler hair.  What was that?  What was that?  The eagle's nest?  Little kid.  Baby.  He's got Hitler.  Blondie is barking in the back.  Hitler did have a baby haircut.  This kid has a haircut like Hitler.  He's riding around.  It's called the Jew moving machine. 
[01:49:00]  He's driving through the ghetto and it moves Jews to other locations.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look at the baby.  It's a Jew mover.  Jesus.  Oh, man.  I get one of these, though.  These are all right.  You should get one of these, Anthony.  It would clean your whole fucking house while you're wet.  You've got a maid.  Oh.  She comes in and fucking vacuums.  You don't have a maid yet?  I got a Mexican.  No, my wife won't let me get a maid. 
[01:49:30]  Fine.  She just doesn't want some fucking lady in the house.  Oh.  No.  All right.  That's true, too.  You never know.  It's another chick in your house.  Yeah, but yours you know.  Right?  What do you mean?  Don't you know the lady who cleans your house?  I know the, yeah, yeah, the maids come over.  It's three of them.  Oh, yeah.  Three Mexicans.  They run around my house cleaning shit up.  But one of them?  It's hot.  Not hot.  Fuckable?  But fuckable.  You think she could fuck her?  Blowjobable?  I bet.  I bet. 
[01:50:00]  How?  How?  What do you mean?  How could you fuck her?  A 20?  I don't know.  A 20 and a fucking taco?  I see it this way, Jimmy.  I come home from work.  She's cleaning, and she's a little late, so she's cleaning my bedroom.  Usually the bedroom's done, because I've got to go upstairs and nap before my trainer  comes over.  So she's cleaning the bedroom.  I walk upstairs, and I open the door, and I go, oh, I'm sorry.  And she goes, oh, I'm almost through in here.  I was like, yeah, I was just going to sleep.  She goes, oh, no, just, you know, I'll be quick. 
[01:50:30]  Just do whatever you need to do.  I'll be okay.  So I start just disrobing in front of her to get into bed, and I fucking pull off my underwear,  and my big, fat cock spills out of my pants.  And she's like, she's holding the vacuum hose, and she looks at the hose, looks at my cock,  like, hey, look at this.  I'm comparing the two.  Except the cock is dirtier than the hose.  Than the vacuum hose, Jimmy. 
[01:51:00]  I'm sorry, what happened?  And then I get in, and I notice she's staring.  So I tap the bed like a creep and go, why don't you join me?  You tap it with your cock?  Yeah, yeah.  You hear the bed being tapped really loudly, but both my hands are behind my head.  And then she goes, oh, should I?  I'm like, ah, don't worry about it.  A little clean up.  Can you do me a favor, Luke?  Can you do a Spanish accent where you do her?  Because it sounds like you're fucking you.  What?  Should I come into bed with you? 
[01:51:30]  She's Mexican.  Yeah, yeah.  That is good, senor.  I don't know, senor Speedy.  What?  You trying to fuck me?  My sinus is a fuck though.  Oy vey.  Slip your burrito into my taco.  Mr. Anthony.  Mr. Anthony.  Should you just say quick because they're downstairs cleaning?  Quick, quick, quick.  And she'd just hike up her dress and while she's bent over, the vacuum would still be going.  You'd have to stick it in real quick.  Really?  She'd be like, okay, come inside.  You're a piece of shit.  Okay, come inside. 
[01:52:00]  And then I'd take the vacuum and suck my cum out.  Don't want no half Mexican baby.  You'd make her work while you're fucking her.  Right.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Dust the fucking bureau while you're pounding your ass.  I wouldn't want to fuck my ass.  And then you get the Arnold Schwarzenegger situation.  Yeah.  But why?  She's sexy there.  I mean, she looks like shit, but I'd fuck.  Why wouldn't you fuck that?  She's sexy there.  I'd fuck that.  She's sexy there, I guess.  I'd get head off that.  Her big titties.  Yeah, look at her big fucking tits.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm feeling that, yo.  Arnold was a bad boy, yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, I'd definitely fuck that.  I'm a bad boy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So you get a tree, Bobby?  No, I don't get a tree.  You don't get a tree?  What's the matter with you?  What's wrong with all these gadgets?  We're saving up the big Jewish.  What about a small one?  Put it on that table of yours.  We go home.  I go home.  I don't have my own Christmas yet.  We still go home.  I go elsewhere, but you've got to have your house to be a little festive, right?  Yeah, but I think we're planning on moving, so. 
[01:53:00]  I may get a tree this year, because I'm having my apartment painted and a couple pieces of furniture.  I may get a little tree.  Get a little one.  Yeah, but what are you going to do with it?  Just like, it's such a fucking weird...  They chop a tree down, so we stick it up for a month.  Bobby, a small tree.  A table one.  A tabletop.  I used to think that shit, but they grow the trees purposely for that.  It's not like they're ripping out forests.  Yeah, what's the matter with Christmas tree?  No, a fake tree I would get.  Here, come Santa Claus.  You've never seen the Christmas tree fields when you're up in New England?  There's a lot of them up there. 
[01:53:30]  No.  Start riding around, all of a sudden you see thousands and thousands of Christmas trees being grown.  Do you think plants can feel pain?  I want to get rid of my fucking plant.  I just can't do it.  What?  I just can't get rid of my plant.  Yeah, of course.  My big dumb tree, it's all lumbering and shit.  I'm going to have to have it trimmed out.  It looks sick.  What tree?  I have a tree in my house.  I got a tree in my house.  You got a tree in your house?  I got a tree on my house.  But you're worried that the plants could feel?  Yeah, I feel really bad.  Like, I want to throw it out, but I kind of feel like it'll be sad.  I feel disloyal.  Probably dying from all this stuff that they see you do to women. 
[01:54:00]  No, but it's hanging in there.  It's not the healthiest tree, but it's hanging in there.  It's trying to commit suicide.  It refuses to drink.  I'm coming in, all the water splashed all over the floor.  I'm going to watch another botched massage.  I'm sure our plants and trees have their own shit.  I don't know.  We just don't have a concept of it.  I can't throw it out.  I don't know if it feels...  I don't think it feels like humans, but it's got its own fucking thing, I'm sure.  I tried throwing it out once, and I came back, and it was at my front door again. 
[01:54:30]  I'm like, this is just weird.  You hear?  Yeah.  Who is that?  Mr. Tree.  You kill bugs?  Yes.  Bugs creep me out.  I rarely kill bugs.  I always kill them.  I actually seek them out to kill them.  Yes.  I always catch and release.  No.  Bugs, yeah.  A roach?  But I'll kick a fucking dog.  No, you won't.  Yes, he will.  You don't fucking kick a dog.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, you don't fuck dogs.  What if a dog...  Are you out of your mind?  I love dogs.  Let me just come up with a situation.  What if a dog, you cooked a nice steak... 
[01:55:00]  Do you tell it in story form, like you tell...  No, no, no, no.  Let's say...  It's a prime rib.  And you got prime rib.  Prime rib.  Love prime rib.  And you're ready to watch...  Big potato.  Big potato.  You're ready to watch the basketball game.  Who's your favorite sports team right now?  Patriots.  Patriots are in the fucking playoffs.  Let's say Patriots are in the playoffs.  Champions.  Because this story Anne's telling, maybe the Knicks were in the playoffs.  All right.  Maybe the Knicks were in the playoffs.  Yeah.  So you're ready.  Let's say you're all ready.  You're all ready.  You got everything set up.  You got your little TV tray. 
[01:55:30]  A drink.  You got a beautiful dinner.  Well, I didn't have a drink.  I mean, this person didn't have a drink at the time.  Right, this person.  So he went upstairs to get that drink, going, you know what?  I fucking forgot.  And I was thinking, prime rib.  He was thinking.  He was thinking prime rib, baked potato, Knicks in the playoffs.  I'm going to have a beer.  What an ideal situation this is.  A nice cold beer.  A brewski.  I'm a recovering alcoholic, and it sounds good to me.  Oh, it sounds great.  All right.  So you understand.  I'm with you.  All right.  And then this person must have heard some kind of a ruckus going on downstairs. 
[01:56:00]  As he might be getting his cold beer.  Right.  He's getting his cold beer to top off this wonderfulness.  And he hears a little ruckus downstairs.  Then he hears a woman say, Chester, what are you doing down there?  I hate her.  Which makes this person think, huh, wait a minute.  My prime rib is down there.  Yeah, it was prime rib, right?  My prime rib is down there.  Yeah.  My baked potato.  I'm getting the beer.  I want to go down. 
[01:56:30]  And the dog is down there.  Dog's Chester.  And there's a ruckus.  Oh, there's dessert, too.  Oh, and there's dessert, too.  Yeah, but that was for later.  What kind of dessert?  I don't know.  When I was told the story, I don't remember the dessert part.  Oh, I thought it was good, though.  But it was waiting to be eaten after the meal, certainly.  It doesn't have to be accurate.  You can lie to me.  I'll never know.  Strawberry sugar.  Let's go with, if it's prime rib, I might go with a little cheesecake.  Oh, God.  Or how about some fucking banana cream pie with whipped cream?  Oh, that'd be good. 
[01:57:00]  Touch Bobby's arm and hold it very romantically.  I'd love to lop off his little mitts.  I'd love to lop off his little mitts.  I'd love to cut his hands off.  Just lop them off and make them into a fucking jewelry.  The snowing Christmas tree must be like being near E-Rock eating powdered donuts.  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  Sorry.  I'm sorry for that one.  A constant fucking Jimmy Hagen shower.  As a guy who takes fat jokes, that's a good one.  You've got to take that one. 
[01:57:30]  Sorry, sorry.  That's a fucking good one.  Jesus, that's a good one.  I'm getting low on E.  I'm going to try to keep that going.  For the record, I'm going for that, E-Rock.  No more jokes from me about you.  No more poking fun at what is obviously a disastrous situation for you.  No more jokes.  It's all fact-based now.  Exactly.  From now on, only hurtful statements.  You're garbage.  So anyway, so then whatever.  Oh, right.  No, no, no.  We're good.  Well, there was a ruckus.  No, no, no.  There was a ruckus. 
[01:58:00]  This person went downstairs to see what the ruckus was about, knowing, though, knowing before  he went down there what the result was going to be when he saw it.  And, yep, there it was, the dog gobbling away at the steak on the floor now, because everything  starts on the floor, which is ruined now.  Now it's ruined.  Ruined.  You can't just pick it up.  Ruined.  It's full of hair and everything.  Well, this person might have salvaged the prime rib and rinsed it out in the sink.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, my fuck.  Oh, that part.  He might have.  He really were into it.  Oh, you can't do that.  There's dog bacteria on it.  But not before the dog received a well-placed boot to the liver and went...  And then the woman might have gone...  Chester, what happens?  Did you get hit growing up, Bobby, misbehaving?  Of course I did.  I got hit.  There was a misbehaving situation going on.  Bobby got hit just for being Bobby, for no reason at all.  I don't even want to go down the road. 
[01:59:00]  I mean, you can if you're on.  It drives me nuts what your grown-up story is.  You kicked a fucking dog?  I never admit that kicking a fucking dog.  Why would I admit to that?  That's crazy.  I've never heard a dog.  Oh, my God.  Fuck that thing.  Fucking taking his goddamn steak.  What's fucking luscious lips doing?  I know.  The intern called luscious lips.  Clark Kent classes.  Yeah.  Not for him. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah, some Sarah McLachlan songs playing.  Remember Patrice's joke?  Or some guy's cake.  Oh, God.  Patrice is the funniest fucking...  His bit on that?  The visualization of a kitten with a headache bag on his head.  Can we find that?  No, not that.  The Patrice bag.  The bit before that he did about fish.  How fuck fish.  Because they have no eyebrows.  They have no eyebrows to show emotion.  When they get killed and when they're living, they're the same stupid face.  Yeah, they could be having the best time or they could be getting killed and they look 
[02:00:00]  exactly the same like dumb fish.  Because they have no eyebrows.  Like a puppy.  Wide open eyes.  A puppy let you know.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Remember that?  That's a fucking brilliant joke.  Let me see.  I want to have some laughs, too.  Let me have a few laughs.  A few laughs.  Oh, is this the bit?  I think so.  We can play it into a break.  I love this.  If it's not the bit, it'll still be great.  It's a great bit.  Yeah, it's Patrice's take on animals.  We'll do it going into a break today.  What the fuck?  We're not breaking right now.  I was saying.  I was ready to flop off my headphones and then I realized, I think we just came back from 
[02:00:30]  a break.  Oh, E-Rock's got it?  How long?  E-Rock.  I want it.  Three and a half minutes.  Yeah, all right.  We'll play that into a break.  I think Jimmy should get a dog.  No, I'm way too much.  And get a little dog you can carry with you, like fucking Paris Hilton.  That'd be adorable.  Isn't that adorable?  Norm would be with a little tiny Yorkie teacup.  It just puts its head out and I just kiss it.  Oh, come here.  You know how many chicks that come up to you everywhere?  We get him a fucking rhinestone bag, but it's a skull with rhinestones. 
[02:01:00]  That'd be fucking pretty cool.  I could bring the little fella with me.  You could bring him everywhere.  Oh, little kisses.  If you saw him at my house, my dog, Kelby.  Did he feed him a booger?  No, I've done that.  I know.  You're terrible.  This cocksucker, when he comes over, Kelby starts screaming.  Kelby?  Starts screaming.  Eeh, eeh, eeh.  Look at it.  Aw.  Goes fucking ballistic.  And all he does, he bends over and he just gets little kisses. 
[02:01:30]  Oh.  And he does that.  Who do?  Who's?  Who's the little seal boy?  He's a seal because he sounds like a seal.  Aw.  So I call him because he's making seal noise.  He has so much.  I'm afraid his little heart's going to burst with love.  And anybody else get a reaction like this?  No.  Just Jimmy.  No.  Dog knows Jimmy.  From that dog.  That dog is the, Kelby, one of the most antisocial dogs until he met Jimmy Norton over at 520.  I have a magical way with animals.  They adore me. 
[02:02:00]  Do you?  Yes.  I'm very good with animals.  And I'm fairly good with children.  But with animals, I'm very good.  Like that guy in fucking Oregon.  Which guy?  Was that guy in Portland?  Oh, it was the Kenan opinion?  The guy that got fucked by the horse and killed.  In Seattle.  Oh, it's Seattle.  Sorry.  Yeah.  He loved animals, too.  Well, animals loved him.  Well, not really.  I remember a story of another guy who might have hit a dog on the nose when it was misbehaving  under the table.  Oh, oh.  Like, took the pointer finger and thumb and then did the flick thing on the tip of that 
[02:02:30]  fucking annoying dog's nose?  Yes.  You did that?  Might have done it.  Yeah.  I'll fess up to it.  You did that with those fucking fat fucking worker man hands?  I know, I do have cheap metal worker hands.  Oh my god, your fucking fingers are the equal size.  From working for a living.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's called working for a living.  Yeah, you have fat...  You do that.  You are a thick-fingered idiot.  I never realized that.  Let me see your little fucking feminine hands.  These are Mike holding hands.  Give me your hands, Mr. Hooper. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  That shit's from opening fucking big five-gallon paint buckets.  It's from punching the wall with disgust of my life.  That's what it was back in the day when I was working for a living.  You have big fat fingers, man.  Are they really fat?  No, they're the man hands.  That's a man hand.  You got man hands, Bobby?  He's got man hands.  Yeah, you have Travis body, but you have man's hands.  You have Mary Tyler Moore body, but...  I got shitty hands.  Yeah, you get little Facebook fingers.  Shitty fucking...  Look at this.  This fucking pinky decided to stop growing somewhere along the way. 
[02:03:30]  Look.  Look.  Yeah, you've never done a day's work in your life.  I got shitty fucking hands.  I got to clip my nails.  Never done anything.  I was a caddy.  Like Edgar.  Caddy's not a day's work.  It's rough.  Caddy.  That was rough work.  Yeah, but you don't do anything with your hands.  You throw it on your shoulder.  Yeah, I fucking learned how to swing a golf club properly.  Yeah, that's not work.  That caused calluses.  That's not work.  This guy was on a roof fucking drunk by noon trying not to fucking die.  I did more cement work than he did.  You what?  Yeah.  I did way more cement work than he did.  I didn't do much cement work. 
[02:04:00]  Don't get me started.  Yeah.  That was one of the things they decided when we were growing up to keep us busy.  We did a lot of cement work around our house.  We had to make paths that led to nowhere, and we had to build a lot of work.  Would you live in a prison?  How much cement work did you do?  My brothers joke that we lived in barracks, so yeah, you're not too far off.  And we would have to build rock walls.  I hate rocks.  That sounds like an independent film.  I fucking hate rocks to this day.  There is a movie that James Spader did about building a wall.  He lost a poker bet, and the guy made him build a wall for a year.  You don't understand.  My dad would trick us. 
[02:04:30]  He goes, hey, I found these woods, and we're going to go, and you guys are going to run  around, and you get to play Army and stuff.  Like, yay, cool.  And we get into the minibus, the Volkswagen minibus, and he would pull over to the side  of the road.  He goes, there you go.  And then he would tell us at that point that actually we're there to collect rocks for the  next rock wall.  Deploy.  Deploy.  He would search out areas where there was an abundance of rocks, and then we would  have to go, and then we'd have to roll them down the hill and fucking pack up the minibus.  That's a good way. 
[02:05:00]  For what?  Make it fun.  How is it fun?  Look, my stepdad goes, here, go out and fucking do that.  Oh, you know what?  Why am I telling him tragic growing up stories?  I would love if my dad went, hey, we're going to have fun.  We're going to have a good time.  We're going to go get rocks.  He'd be like, let's go get rocks.  Go out and fucking do the yard work, or I'll punch you in the face with a hatchet.  Jesus.  We all had our issues, didn't we?  Everybody did.  Yeah, but I just realized I'm telling him, like, you got us all beat, Bobby. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, but I didn't get, he didn't fuck me.  No, no.  Those people, those people.  That's bad.  Those people.  My father called me a faggot.  Always thought I was a faggot.  Really?  Because I was crying like a faggot.  I got that, too.  Constantly.  I got a little baby, which I think is worse.  No, it's not.  Baby.  That fucks with your man.  Faggot.  You know you're not a faggot.  Baby, it's like you're a little baby.  It's like you're a little baby.  You know when your father's calling you a faggot, you think that's fucking better than  baby?  Because I didn't know what faggot was when I was being called a baby.  It was him.  How did you know what a faggot was? 
[02:06:00]  Because my dad would fucking tell me.  I'd hear him talk about the faggots.  That's what a faggot is.  Because I heard fucking, let me hear, I heard faggot, chink, nigger was like all the time  in the house.  Constantly.  That was a big one.  And there was one more.  I don't think he minded the Jews.  Oh, and my mom was a fuck face. 
[02:06:30]  That was it.  My mom was a fuck face.  Is your dad dead?  Yes, he is.  Did you kill him?  No.  No.  Right.  But, oh, what a joy growing up.  When did he die?  Back in the mid-90s.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Wow.  That was that.  Were you friends with him?  Yeah, you know.  It was okay.  It got better later in life when, you know, I was able to say, I am working. 
[02:07:00]  I actually have a girlfriend, albeit an ugly one.  At the time, I had a real fucking ugly girlfriend that I was embarrassed to show him pictures  of.  I've talked about this a little earlier in the program.  What made her ugly?  She had a fucking Picasso face.  It was just...  It was just...  A weird nose?  Everything.  Nose, eyes that were way too close together.  The eyebrows were a little too bushy?  Eyes were too close together.  Like that?  That's close.  Get out of here. 
[02:07:30]  Anthony, I would love to see her.  That's a good one, Danny.  All the chicks, except the one you're dating at your parties.  She was...  Yeah, her eyes were way too close together.  She had, like, lips that were too big.  Like sugar?  Horrible schnoz.  And just really not an...  But why did you go with her then?  That girl looks like butthead.  Why did you go with her?  Because she would fuck me.  You didn't get pussy back in the day.  No, I did.  But I didn't care if they were ugly or not. 
[02:08:00]  Oh my God.  Is that her real face, you think?  That's something.  Danny's finding great pictures of ugly girls.  Did it morph that face?  Wow.  Okay, this is my problem.  When you have a kid...  Like, you lucked out, Ope, because your kids are fucking gorgeous.  But were you nervous at any point?  Look at me.  What was I supposed to have?  An ugly kid?  And then I got a beautiful wife on top of it.  Of course I was supposed to have a beautiful kid.  A little fucking red toehead could have swapped out.  Be some fucking gene from way back, like, three generations ago. 
[02:08:30]  You're a fucking Viking shit gene that you have.  The freak of the Hughes family.  You're the guy at 300 that can't be in the fucking group?  My father gave me his helmet.  It was supposed to be launched over the fucking cliff.  All right, we'll let you in.  Pick up your shield.  Like, to my fucking arm.  Wait.  All right, you can listen.  Just go fucking...  Where were we going with this?  Go go out the backfield.  Where were you going with this?  I don't know.  We were all just...  No, Bobby. 
[02:09:00]  Where were you going?  Oh, Bobby.  I'm afraid that you have a kid, and God forbid.  I mean, that...  Unless the parents are as ugly as that fuck.  How about...  You know, I was just fucking around, obviously.  You see them at the playground where you see a beautiful kid, and you see the parents,  and they're ugly as sin.  You're like, how the fuck did that happen?  You could tell that it's their kid.  They didn't adopt or anything.  They used to throw babies out.  When they came out with a hair lip or fucked up or something wrong with it, they used to toss them  out the fucking window, and there was a pile of babies. 
[02:09:30]  The window.  There was a pile of babies right on the fucking back of the town.  Yeah, you go to the back of the town, the baby pile, and they just flip your throat over  like...  That was it.  Now you're going to keep it.  You guys, I know we're on the internet right now.  You want to look at Awkward Boners?  What's Awkward?  Why would we look on the internet?  Why would we just take our dicks out here?  Well, my brother-in-law is always searching for shit for us.  Why would Awkward Boners be a site?  It's called AwkwardBoners.com.  Oh, okay.  It's got to be people that have boners.  The best one ever. 
[02:10:00]  Have you seen the kid?  He's online, and there's some beachy camp situation.  There's an error establishing a data connection.  Oh, there we go.  Oh, there it is.  Awkward Boners.  Wait, what's that one?  That guy's just kidding me.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on.  That's something Jimmy would do.  Yeah.  What about that?  Wait, wait, where's the second one?  Who's got the boner?  Oh, the guy on the right has his cock head.  Oh, man.  Dude.  All right, that guy.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  That's not real.  It's one of those ballet things.  Wait, why don't you think it's real? 
[02:10:30]  These aren't real.  The guy's got the big fucking rod.  Wow, that bike guy had a big rod.  That's real.  That's not real.  Look at him.  He's rotting it.  You don't think they're real?  No, the bike one isn't real.  No?  The bike one doesn't look real.  What would a rod look like if it was in a bicycle guy's pants?  The ballerina dude looks real.  It's not going to go straight up to your belly button.  No?  No.  Where's it going to go?  If you have a rod...  Yours doesn't reach your belly button?  No.  In bicycling pants?  Yeah, mine.  Listen, what I'm saying is that if you get a rod and you're in a fucking tour of France, 
[02:11:00]  you're going to move it over to the side or stick it in your ass like a tranny.  You're not going to let it just go straight up like...  If it's turgid, you can't bend that thing.  Nice fucking word.  Look at this asshole.  Oh my god, come on.  That's like a Bobo situation.  That's my all-time favorite boner picture.  And you think it's real?  Yes, this one is completely...  Look at him.  He's scoping that chick's ass right there.  Holy fuck.  He just wants it so bad.  Girls in between, man.  Why would you like...  We're all good at hiding our boners.  Why wouldn't the kid hide his boner? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, he might as well just be jerking it off right there.  Yeah.  I just...  Look at his attire isn't prepared for hiding boners.  No.  There's not much you can do in a bathing suit.  What are you going to do?  Flip it up and then it's hanging out the top.  That's why belts were made.  So you could fucking tie a boner down.  That's before they put the little mesh thing in the shorts.  I hate the mesh thing.  It hurts the...  Of course you do, because your dick is so huge.  For regular dicks, it's fine.  No, no.  It makes the tip of your dick, like, when you walk, it kind of runs like a cheese grater 
[02:12:00]  on that fucking thing.  It's terrible.  It doesn't happen to me.  So you don't know if awkward boners is real?  Some of those didn't look real.  Some of those, I'm sure, are real.  But some of them looked a little strange.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Why don't you start your own thing where you have your fans do awkward boners?  Oh.  Because that's fucking gay?  Could you send in your own cock pics?  Thank you, fans.  Well, touche, Anthony.  Apparently.  Look at this idiot on the subway.  Oh, God. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, I saw...  There was...  I gotta find it.  There was a story, I think it was from the Daily News or the Post yesterday, of this  guy.  He was riding the subway with crotchless nylons on, but he was keeping his knees together,  but then just opening them up a little bit and someone snagged a picture of him.  Really?  What a creep.  Those purrs on the subway, man.  Absolutely.  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about fucking bringing the fag to the show?  Yeah, yeah, there you go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, let's get this.  Wait a minute.  I have this video of this guy in nylon.  Hey, we didn't solicit it, though.  Like, you're fucking saying.  You didn't see this guy?  Oh, man. 
[02:13:00]  What the fuck, dude?  What the fuck?  Read the story.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  What a creep.  Is this a real story?  Yeah.  Let me see the picture.  Read the story itself.  Jesus.  This is like a blog, but let's see.  Hey, can we put this on our Facebook page?  He has hairy legs and big cock.  But he has a woman's coat on.  Yeah.  I think I bought that coat for my wife for Christmas.  He has a J-Lo puffy coat.  Yeah.  She says,  This guy was sitting across from me last night at 1030 on the L train. 
[02:13:30]  He was wearing crotchless nylons and opening and closing his legs to reveal his penis.  I took photos, which he saw me do, and he confronted me when I got off at 6th Avenue,  hurled threatening epithets at me and chased me out of the street.  Fuck you if you're going to do that.  Yeah, you're going to fuck you, man.  This man does not seem like a harmless pervert.  He's got a huge piece.  Here's the picture, Brace for Impact.  I would just assume...  Brace is not falafagous looking.  Nice cock.  Don't you assume...  Don't you assume most women just laugh at that shit, though?  Yeah.  No.  Most do.  Some women... 
[02:14:00]  You never hear about it.  As long as this idiot's not following him after they get off the subway, I would assume  women would laugh at this shit.  They're not horrified, are they?  I don't like his fat knees.  Like, why...  His hairy fat knees.  What argument could it have?  Like, oh, why are you taking pictures?  I'd be like, why the fuck are you showing your cock, then, in the train, you fucking asshole?  Then you get tossed in front of a fucking train.  Not if you shove a gun in his face.  Whoa.  Shoot his big cock off.  Bullet bounces back, hits you in the mouth.  Oh, mmm.  That's a leash.  I'm talking about that incident where the guy got thrown into the subway. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Who's side are you on?  What?  Who do you support in this?  Who do you support in this?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes.  It's fucking sad.  Although, the Asian guy confronted the crazy person.  You don't confront crazies, do you?  I have.  I kicked a guy in the subway in New York.  Oh, yeah?  Why?  Because he was screaming at fucking ladies.  Like, there's all these ladies, and they're just screaming, fuck you.  Like, she was wearing a fur coat, and then she was screaming at all these women.  Just going in their face, screaming at them. 
[02:15:00]  Really?  They're calling them cunts and fuck you.  And then I told them to shut the fuck up, and then they came at me, and I gave them a  Rich Voss spinning kick.  Oh, wow.  Where your leg doesn't fucking fully extend, and you're off balance, and you fall, too,  when you kick them.  That's the Rich Voss kick.  You just described it perfectly.  Yeah, his kicks are like short rounds kicks in fucking...  Indiana Jones.  The funniest thing I've ever seen is when we did the O&A, when we did the fucking pilot  of Comedy Central, and they met Keith Robinson.  God, why this isn't out there for people to see. 
[02:15:30]  They were fighting.  They fought, and this is what I knew, what a fucking little slimeball Voss is.  And they got into a fight, and it got a little heated.  They both had blindfolds on, and he picked up his blindfold, looked to find Keith, and  then threw a front kick.  A kick.  And then they had a real fight.  He kicked him.  He picked his blindfold up, found Keith, and then threw a fucking kick, not even to his  front, to his back.  He kicked Keith in the back.  And then Keith took him down and fucking grinded him to the floor. 
[02:16:00]  You want to play?  God, that pilot was a horrible idea.  It was a fucking nightmare.  Did you guys know what you were doing, though?  We didn't want to do it.  Because it was a dumb idea.  Now I think we fucked up our chances at Comedy Central.  Well, did you know that?  You should have spent it.  Whatever, though.  Did you take charge of that?  A few years now.  Did you guys?  I didn't know what was happening.  No, no, no.  We were stupid in the end.  I kept saying this is a dumb idea, dumb idea, and they're like, well, but, you know, this  could be good for down the road with you guys in Comedy Central.  Oh, yeah.  You never let those idiots dictate you.  Of course.  You live and learn. 
[02:16:30]  I mean, they were unfocused.  Live and learn.  It could have been a good show with a lot of work.  What was the thing that we got, the option where we didn't want to do something and the  person could, the freak, something like that?  Well, I added that to just, I added the freak thing just to try to fucking make it better.  Because what they had, they didn't have the freak thing.  Eastside Dave.  That's when I became a fan of him.  Because he was hilarious.  And he did, oh, I think he shaved his, he had to shave his nipple and drink the water. 
[02:17:00]  And then he just, he had to shave his nipple in public.  That's easy for him.  That's all he had to do.  But then he just drank the water.  Dude, that's easy for him.  Oh my God.  He ate his own shit on our show.  He ate his own shit on our show.  I was here with his shit in a hat.  Go shit in your hat.  He's shit in a hat.  That was part of our shit stage.  Thank God we're out of our shit stage.  I don't know whose hat it was.  I think it was an intern's hat was stupid.  And he took it off and shit in it.  All right.  Listen, we're going to go to break with the Patrice O'Neill animals thing. 
[02:17:30]  But Bob Kelly is playing.  Tonight.  Stanhope.  Stanhope House in Stanhope, New Jersey.  And if you guys want the next five people to email this son of a bitch info at catcharisingstar.com,  you get two for one.  Next five people.  Info at catcharisingstar.com.  And for tonight's show at the Stanhope House in Stanhope, New Jersey.  Tomorrow night, Uncle Vinny's, Point Pleasant.  They're open.  Which, you know, it's all fucked up down there.  But Uncle Vinny's is open.  So come to that show too.  Tomorrow night.  Support the neighborhood.  Yep.  Tomorrow night.  And we go to break with Patrice O'Neill, the great Patrice O'Neill, the benefits sold 
[02:18:00]  out, which is so cool, talking about animals.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Patrice.  Good morning.  I have a feeling you might have something to say about the Michael Vick thing.  Because I remember when this whole thing went down, you were like, you guys don't understand  the culture of what goes on.  I love dogs.  Love them more than people, as Bill was saying.  I love dogs.  I knew you'd have something to say.  I couldn't, people who are vicious to animals bug me, you know, especially if you're up 
[02:18:30]  at four o'clock in the morning watching Isle of Lucy and Sarah McLaughlin comes on.  I will remember you.  Showing a picture of a kitten with conjunctivitis and a fucking puppy smoking a cigarette with  a fucking headache bag on.  If you don't feel bad for animals after you're watching a fucking watery eyed kitten.  Dude, that is the fucking worst commercial.  And it's in between fucking Carol Burnett, fucking Guthy Rankin selling Carol Burnett and 
[02:19:00]  a Lucy.  And it's so long, the commercial.  And a fucking pit bull puppy missing a paw, snorting cocaine.  He has no home.  Now, if you don't fucking feel for an animal after you watch that, you're a fucking serial  killer.  There's a one-eyed cat.  You're a hunk of shit.  If a kitten with a fucking, with pink eye doesn't fuck you up, you're a cocksucker. 
[02:19:30]  Look at it.  Look at it.  Turn this shit off, man.  I don't want to see that shit.  I don't want to see that, man.  We're watching the commercial.  The dog with the paralyzed back legs.  Oh, fucking no.  Oh, look at that.  What a bad boy he's been.  That dog looks so sad.  He must have misbehaved.  Dude, I can't even look at that commercial.  It ruins me. 
[02:20:00]  I'm Sarah McLachlan.  Yes, bitch.  I spread peanut butter on my pussy.  Let the dog lick it off.  She sings his sad songs.  I know.  And it gets sadder and sadder, bitch.  Kill yourself.  Throw a Frisbee to that fucking thing.  These poor animals, man.  That looks like a healthy dog.  Exactly.  The whole thing's about money.  Look at the poor little kid.  It ain't about money.  A kitten.  Kittens with a headache is the worst thing ever.  A headache.  A fucking headache bag. 
[02:20:30]  A fucking school cartoon headache bag.  And a cigarette.  And fucking deep thoughts and shit.  I don't need it.  Goddamn produce.  I fucking.  I love animals.  Three-legged cat.  Three-legged cat.  What's wrong with that dog?  That dog looks normal.  I don't know.  Look at more.  What's wrong with these animals?  And how long is this fucking infomercial?  Forever this goddamn thing takes so long. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, but you don't know what these animals did to bother the owner.  They don't share the whole picture.  I refuse to look at it any longer, man.  The guy's fucking scrubbing his pots and pans with a kitten's eye.  Yeah, exactly.  Who are these people who hate animals, man?  Oh, no.  I love animals, but I will punch a kitten squarely in the middle of its face.  If it mews while I'm watching TV, I will punch it squarely in its face.  If it mews.  Fucking assholes, man.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[02:21:30]  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  I'm kind of mad.  I've got a decision to make.  I've got to either do the Jew thing this weekend or go to FH Riley's for a big fan gathering.  Yeah, there's a big thing going on.  And we haven't really promoted the big fan gathering.  They do it every year, and they do it at my brother's joint, which I greatly appreciate. 
[02:22:00]  This is the first I'm hearing of it.  I know.  We should have promoted this all week.  I love those when you do those.  They're great.  Great party.  I've done them a long time.  So tomorrow night at FH Riley's 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village,  getting ready to expand.  We're very excited about that.  The fans are getting together.  They do it every Christmas.  Bunch of degenerate guys and skanky chicks.  Newsday Lord takes care of the whole thing every year, right?  It's her thing.  What time does it start?  Like 1 a.m. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, that's fine.  We have a fight to watch on Saturday.  Saturday night is one of the best fights ever on free TV.  Nick Diaz.  Nick Diaz.  Oh, we got Dan White calling today.  Yeah, fuck that.  And who?  BJ.  BJ and fucking Rory.  Oh, Rory, right?  Yeah, Rory is an animal.  Oh, Rory's an animal.  This guy's a fucking serial killer.  He's an animal.  I even know Rory.  All he does, this is when you know someone's going to lose, when they're with their daughter  eating steak off a barbecue, and the other guy is just playing Xbox in his underwear.  He has a TV, an Xbox, he bangs chicks and trains. 
[02:23:00]  That's all he does.  Really?  Oh.  Jesus.  Fucking great.  And what a gang.  He's an animal.  You have some orange stuff on your fucking mic.  He said yesterday, he goes, BJ's going to lose this fight because he's doing it for  other people's opinion of him.  I'm doing it to hurt him.  Wow.  Yeah, Rory's a fuck.  Rory McDonald, right?  Yeah.  He's great.  And I can't wait for this.  He's one of the up and coming, he's going to be a monster.  Big Canadian guy.  Great looking guy, too.  Holy shit, good looks. 
[02:23:30]  A lot of people.  Is he the one that looks, who's the other guy that looks kind of young and looks like  there's no way he has the skills he has?  That's him.  It is him, right?  That's him, yeah.  Show him right on there.  No.  That guy right there.  Let me see.  Ooh, he is.  No, there's another guy, too.  He dresses fucking savvy, too.  I hope.  We love BJ Penn.  We love the guys that come in and do our show.  BJ's done our show.  BJ's one of my favorite fighters of all time.  He's the shit.  Who are you picking?  You know, when you see a BJ, I want him to win, but when I see a guy playing with his 
[02:24:00]  kid instead of fucking punching a bag.  Oh, really?  That was just for the photo op.  Yeah, but then you have a birthday party and this cake, and then you look and there's  somebody cooking something on a grill.  It's like Rocky when he was training in the hotel lobby instead of fucking the basement  like Clever Lang was.  You go to Rory McDonald.  He's Gino.  He's just at the...  He's training with an NHL fucking hockey player.  Hey, Babu.  I gotta go with what you just said because, like, having two kids now, it absolutely is  harder to do my job. 
[02:24:30]  Now imagine you're a UFC fighter.  So you're right.  Hey, you lost the eye of the tiger, Rock.  Yeah.  You used to have the eye.  I still got the eye, but I also have...  We're done with this.  You owe me a favor.  I also have to fucking sweep up fake snow all day long now.  It's not easy.  I absolutely still have the eye of the tiger, but I'm also fucking...  You have the eye of the fucking kitty cat.  Making sure my son doesn't choke out my new one.  But I do have the eye of the tiger.  I really do, Bob.  If you could have stopped and just... 
[02:25:00]  Now you have two.  I know you love your kid.  I know that.  But if you could have, looking back going, you know what, let's just have one.  No.  You'd have two.  Every kid I grew up with that was an only child was a weirdo.  You gotta have more than one.  I'm not doing it.  You're not gonna have kids at all?  I'm gonna have kids.  Of course I'm gonna have kids.  When are you gonna have kids?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's going on?  When are you gonna have kids, man? 
[02:25:30]  What the fuck?  I'm gonna have kids, but I'm not gonna...  I don't think I'm having one.  That's it.  You're gonna go one.  You're gonna raise a weirdo.  I'll raise a fucking serial killer.  I saw a lady going to Aruba with fucking double carriages and fucking playpens and two...  Playpens with the sand?  Whining little fucking cocksuckers.  Fuck that.  I just saw her...  I saw the...  Just...  I quit.  I'm on the verge of giving up in her face. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, wow.  I'm not doing that.  All right.  When you look at this parent with one kid and it's a little tiny stroller and they flip  it up and the kid sits in the lap.  I hear you, but I...  We'll see, but I wouldn't mind one more.  Which one do you like better?  And don't tell me you like both of them the same.  I like my son better just because he's been around longer.  Right.  I've had a...  You know, but now that this tape will be played in the future, thanks a lot, Bobby.  No, I mean...  You can't...  You can't like...  I said it like last week.  My daughter's finally becoming aware, so it's a lot more fun already. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, but you can't...  But the first couple months, it's just...  I don't even know...  They don't even know what they're staring at.  They don't move their eyes or nothing.  They just want to be fed.  But you're going to like one of them better.  That's just the human nature.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can't like two separate things that aren't exactly the same...  Exactly the same.  You can't like them that way.  Like, you ask me that question a year from now, I will absolutely not answer that question.  You won't.  Nope.  Because you know that one of them...  No, it'll get back to them.  Now it's easy to answer that because the one is brand new. 
[02:27:00]  Right.  I haven't done anything with the one yet.  I don't have the breast.  The first two, three months of the kid's life, it's all about the kid and the mom, basically.  And I hold and change a diaper here and there.  What, the breastfeeding?  You bring home the bacon.  How's that?  How's the breastfeeding?  Is that gross?  It's weird.  When milk comes out of a nipple?  It's just weird.  Do you get jealous?  Like, hey, that's my tit.  Well, that's...  I don't want that.  Now I'm just used to it, I guess.  You wouldn't feed off a...  Oh, fucking bull. 
[02:27:30]  You wouldn't suck it down and drink that sugary milk?  Wait, sugary?  Have you ever done that, Jimmy?  No.  No.  Look at Jimmy.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  I know there's fathers out there that have tried it.  Have you tasted it?  I swear to God, I have not.  It's a fetish for people.  They love it when women...  I swear to you, fucking sick bastards.  And I'm a goofball, and I wouldn't do it just as a goof.  You've got to be going to hell.  If God looks down and sees you having a mom squeeze her baby milk into your selfish 
[02:28:00]  cocksucker milk for money, you're going to hell.  You wouldn't suck that fucking...  It smells like body.  It smells like human body and a little sugar on it.  Oh.  Hold on a minute.  How do you know?  I just heard.  I forgot about this.  You ate it.  I have tasted breast milk.  Yes.  But I refused to taste my wife's.  You tasted Voss's baby shit.  Why wouldn't you taste your own baby?  I got caught on that one.  I had no...  Okay.  I was not going to do that fucking problem.  I set up a bit that I thought would never happen, and these assholes set me up behind 
[02:28:30]  the scenes.  I love it.  They got me bad.  Voss was right around the corner with a baby diaper.  I basically said from time to time, I would just go in there and go, look, if someone shows  up within the next hour, I'll do a baby diaper mustache.  That's gross.  Knowing that the odds of that are slim to none, but then these guys set me up.  It was your fan base.  But they set me up behind the scenes, and they hinted that maybe today would be the day  to put that out there again, and then all of a sudden Voss walks in.  Do you remember...  So I didn't want to be a pussy.  It looked like somebody scraped out the back of a juicer. 
[02:29:00]  Dude, it was fucking...  Just thinking about it.  Yeah, that's terrible.  Oh, so Pat Duffy's sister.  Pat Duffy's sister had a kid, so we started talking about breast milk, and we made ice  cream with Pat Duffy's sister's breast milk.  It was delicious.  That's kind of...  But then the aftertaste was beyond horrendous.  I was about to interrupt you.  Oh, you tasted it too, right?  It was delicious for two seconds.  Two seconds, and then the second part of the taste, or whatever the fuck, how that works, 
[02:29:30]  it starts...  It was like that zebra gum.  Fruit striped gum.  Fruit striped gum.  When you first put it in your mouth, it tasted like ice cream, and it was even vanilla ice cream.  I remember, and I'm like, man, this is...  And then it hits you, and then you just...  It was like licking a fucking scab.  It was like licking a sweaty armpit.  Oh.  Right?  It was strange.  You knew it was milk.  You knew it was okay for you.  Your body is registering this is okay to have, but the taste, there was just something foul  about it that registered that made you go, it's good, it's okay, but this is wrong. 
[02:30:00]  You shouldn't be doing this.  It went from tasting good to holy fuck, what did I just do within a second, I think.  Two seconds, yeah.  And just knowing that I've ingested, like, parts of Pat Tuffy's sisters.  God.  She made that for me.  And it's not a...  I'm looking at this photo.  It's not like a hole in the nipple.  It's a bunch of little holes.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like it just comes out of one.  It's like a fucking broken shower head.  It's like a shower head that needs to be soaked in that anti-calcium shit.  CLR.  Yeah, that's CLR. 
[02:30:30]  Soak your nipple in CLR.  It's fucking...  We used to have a girl when we used to do bits, Bobby.  She would run around the studio squirting us with breast milk.  Oh, God.  You were horrified.  You were horrified.  When you had the eye of the tiger.  I have the eye of the tiger.  Eye of the tiger.  You guys had the eye of the tiger.  You guys lost it.  I got the eye of the tiger.  I'm just a little more distracted right now.  I still got it, Bobby.  Still got it.  Where are the hores?  Fucking hell.  Oh, man.  What is that?  Disgusting.  It's a lactating slut.  Can't you read?  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  Lactating slut.  Why would you just squirt breast milk on your vagina?  It's just gross.  Why would you do that?  It feels good.  You wouldn't lick your...  I like to say titty milk off a cunt.  How the fuck does this go?  Titty milk off a cunt.  Okay.  Ugh.  Now, let me ask you a question, Opie.  Does it leak?  Do you just look over and the shirt's wet?  It's...  I guess it does. 
[02:31:30]  That's a good one.  I've never...  Wow.  I swear to you, and I'm embarrassed, I didn't know that happened.  Really?  I thought it was one hole.  You thought it was one hole?  I have to say it.  I have to be the idiot.  It's not one hole?  No, it's a bunch of little holes.  I always thought it was just one hole.  I'm an idiot.  That's a bunch.  Oh, God.  Why am I learning that in my 40s?  I didn't know it either.  I didn't know that.  I learned it in my 30s.  Did you...  You didn't...  You didn't know that?  No, why would I?  I don't acknowledge that.  Because we've been around a while.  It was like a shotgun blast.  So why, when the girl came in, it came out of one hole? 
[02:32:00]  No, I think it came out of a couple.  I remember one stream, like a fucking...  I wasn't looking very closely.  Water pistol type of situation.  Oh, God.  What?  It's just...  It's all natural.  Have you smelled your wife's farts, Bobby?  Oh, my God.  Well...  I've never smelled my wife's farts.  Yeah.  Never?  No, man.  I don't know what the fuck she does.  My chick farted in bed a month ago.  I'm aware when she...  She laughed.  She was laughing before it happened.  Really?  She was going, oh, my God. 
[02:32:30]  She was just giggling.  Oh, she felt it.  And it was...  I got mad.  Like, I wasn't...  Like, I didn't even...  It was so bad that I went, are you fucking stupid?  Really?  Like, and she was like...  She's laughing.  She's laughing hysterically, because I'm always farting.  And I was like, seriously, are you fucking dumb?  Why would you do that?  It, like, made me angry.  It was so vile.  That's funny.  It was like, she fucking ate poison, and something that died, that ate something that died, and  then fucking licked a fucking dirty pussy, and then... 
[02:33:00]  Do you think your wife goes in the other room and farts when you're not looking?  She has to.  I think she has an assistant.  Like, she probably sneaks out at, like, three in the morning and just opens the window and  cuts a bunch of gassers and waves them out.  She goes off to...  She has a fart room?  Yeah.  She goes off...  It's like a safe room.  She pulls a book down, and a special door opens.  Yeah.  And a fan aiming at the window, and she just cuts gassers.  It looks like one of those fucking smoking rooms at an airport, where ceilings are all  fucking yellow.  Remember the smoking rooms? 
[02:33:30]  I once farted so bad in the middle of the night that I woke her up from her sound sleep,  and then she...  Oh, man.  And all I remember was being woken up, because she was so fucking pissed.  Jesus.  I guess I farted while I was sleeping, and it was so bad I woke her up.  How...  That's got me bad.  I've heard my wife fart.  You have?  I've heard her fart in the middle of sleep.  It's so...  It's just...  Those little...  Those little...  Because...  And then you look at her face, and she's grinding her teeth, because even in her sleep, 
[02:34:00]  she's trying to be...  Just not let her asshole...  Just...  And I...  You can always...  Because you see, my dogs will get up, because they'll hear it.  They hear like...  It's like a dog whistle.  Yeah.  At first, you don't hear anything, but the dogs hear it.  Yeah.  They're tilting their heads sideways.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's funny.  And I'm looking around, like, for fucking mice.  Yeah.  And then, does it reek? 
[02:34:30]  No, those don't smell, but she farted the other...  You know who really has?  My dog, Kelby.  I know.  He has farts, and he's getting old now, and I think something in his stomach is dying.  That's disgusting.  Fucking dogs farting.  Stop it.  And you can hear...  You can hear this.  This is what you hear.  He'll be sleeping on the bed.  We're actually going to stop crating him now, but...  Crating him?  What's that mean?  Put him in a crate at night.  Because he's sleeping on the bed, and you hear this.  Oh! 
[02:35:00]  And then...  Nothing worse than that.  This fucking cunt gets up and walks away from it.  And it's pure dog shit.  Yeah.  It's pure shit.  Smelling like...  It's a shit.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, shit.  One time I actually saw his asshole open up.  Ah!  Because you know you can see dogs' assholes.  Did it grow a shout out?  It just...  Dogs are fucking disgusting.  I love dogs, but they are fucking gross.  They're disgusting with those farts. 
[02:35:30]  And it's not even like a person where it's like,  Oh, it's a human being.  I can't really do anything about it.  Like, dogs, it's...  You don't have to deal with that shit.  Ugh, I hate dogs.  I love dogs.  How can you hate a fucking dog?  They're filthy animals.  They're a fucking...  They'll protect you.  They're filthy animals.  But you like a cat?  Dog has personality.  I don't like cats.  I like a take a cat.  No, I don't like cats either,  because they fucking shit in the house in a box.  You do too.  And it's...  I shit in the toilet.  Yeah, but the same thing in the toilet.  No, it's in water and you flush it.  It doesn't sit there for a fucking couple of days. 
[02:36:00]  You get the new fucking cat thing that actually...  Fuck that.  And if you let a cat out, like...  Oh, no, it's an outdoor cat.  That means your cat's gonna die.  It's getting run over.  What?  Cats are amazing at finding fucking tires to run underneath.  Whenever you see a dead cat, it's one arm.  It's still stretched out.  Like, it just didn't see it coming.  You never see a cat in sitting pose.  It's always in mid-run.  Yeah, it's mid-run.  What is that?  Oh, God.  Oh, look at his dumb fucking dog face. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, he's so cute.  Would you punch that dog for fighting the tub?  No.  I'd punch the top of his nose.  Why?  Why would you hit an animal?  You fucking nuts.  Yeah, don't hit animals.  That's stupid.  You can't hit a fucking animal.  You punch the bridge of his nose.  You punch its bottom teeth into the tub.  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  You punch the fucking top of his nose.  No, you're stupid.  That's horrible.  The way you're with my dog, I know you're not like that.  I've punched many dogs.  You never punch my dog.  You love my dog.  Bobby, is he weak around your dog?  If you saw Norton come to my house to fucking be with my dog, not me. 
[02:37:00]  You like dogs, right, Jimmy?  You would have one.  Don't I have a video?  I think I have a video.  Yeah, there's a video.  I just saw a video on my computer of...  Well, the problem is, Kelby's little heart bursts with love.  Enough with this name, Kelby.  That's his name.  Where did you get the name Kelby?  That's an adorable name for a little Chewbacca dog.  Yeah, dude, it is.  Is it the cute?  Yes.  I hate it because it is a cute name.  God damn it.  Kelby.  Kelby.  It's like Shelby and Kelly.  There you go.  What is it?  There you go.  Let me see dumb Kelby.  Let's see.  Let's see your dumb fucking dog. 
[02:37:30]  Is this where Jimmy's a...  Wow, that dog loves you.  Do you like how happy Kelby is to see me?  It makes me sick.  I hate it.  That dog loves you, Jimmy.  He follows him around.  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  It's a little dog.  It makes you feel like...  It does. 
[02:38:00]  It's weird.  He's trying to communicate with you.  Dog loves you.  His little dog heart.  Aw.  It's going to burst with love.  So full of love.  But this is what Norton is.  This is how he can compartmentalize.  Yeah, exactly.  You said it.  I said it in a nice way.  He compartmentalizes his feelings.  He'll come to my house, get his love for my dog, and shut that shit down, and then go  get a hooker.  And then shut that down, and go out to dinner with a friend.  And then close that door, and go to bed. 
[02:38:30]  That's it.  No.  But what happens is, all the doors crack open, and that's why I don't sleep.  Because all of a sudden, the hallway gets cluttered.  Right.  With hookers, and dog love, and friendship, and no girlfriend.  All he sees in this dark room are those glowing eyes.  One's of a dog, one's of a fucking woman of questionable sexuality.  One's of a woman with a glow-in-the-dark condom on her.  That's actually not questionable at all.  Why is that guy wearing a dress? 
[02:39:00]  Oh, shit.  Dr. Steve just tweeted me saying,  Breast milk flan is always fun to make for your friends.  Is he just fucking around?  Breast milk flan?  Is he fucking around?  No, that's what he makes.  Usually he doesn't fuck around.  It's breast milk and donkey cum.  Mixed with grapes.  Oh, God.  By the way, flan stinks.  Flan is horrible.  Stop making believe it's a good dessert.  It's bread with fucking, with fruit vomit on it.  Everything else you can have.  Why would you get the flan?  Why would you get the flan?  Dr. Steve, if you're out there, from riotcast.com. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Oh, he's one of your guys.  Oh, one of the best shows on the network.  It's great.  You know what show became really good?  It's fucking the Comedy Cellar table.  I know.  I know.  Fucking great show.  But some women don't produce milk.  And if my wife, she has fake titties, is that going to affect...  Your wife's got the fake boobs.  I got the fake boobies, yeah.  I swear to you until just now, I didn't know that one either.  Really?  I'm learning so much shit today.  They say you can nurse. 
[02:40:00]  I've seen her a million times.  She's got a great pair.  She's got a great pair.  You can't tell.  It's got a little, what's that called?  A little droop.  Oh, yeah?  You pick them up and they fall.  It's not like straight out.  What do you mean?  Some titties, you know, they get what they do when they move.  What are you talking about?  You know?  They get the muscle.  Remember, at any W, these girls would come in here, they'd look amazing in sweaters and  stuff, and then they'd take them off and they're just two fucking hard balls in front of their show.  Well, that's if they're too small-titted.  He hasn't seen a fucking C-cup in fucking five years. 
[02:40:30]  They're still developing.  Yeah, he's fucking dealing.  He's going to fucking undo a training bra.  He gets them when they're Bs.  He doesn't get to see them when they're Ds.  What's a C and a D?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  The fucking grade you got.  Uncle Paul.  Stupid.  So I wonder if with fake titties you can produce milk.  Yeah, they say you can.  Really?  You can nurse off.  Were her nipples taken off?  Some girls get the nipple taken off.  Yeah, they had them taken off and they didn't put them back on. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, so.  Were they in a drawer?  I had them put my logo, my RobertKelleyLive.com logo.  I know.  I know.  I like that really was the case, you idiot.  When you just start doing comedy.  Oh, no, that's not true.  I don't know.  Some lady out there listening.  That's disgusting that you did that to your wife's nipples.  I know you have to sell tickets, but Jesus Christ.  I'm ready to do your podcast again.  Let's come.  I get to do it once a year, I guess. 
[02:41:30]  Why?  I did it last year around this time.  It looks like a pretty pro fucking setup you got there, too.  It's all right.  No, I know.  At first, you just had a couple of microphones and stuff, but now it's like, look, and you  got the banner up and everything.  Maybe we got a bunch of shit.  Yeah, it looks pretty cool.  We're right above the Comedy Cellar now.  Yeah?  They have a little studio.  It's pretty goddamn cool.  Yeah, it's good.  It's a good place.  Maybe that's where I'll do my podcast.  Podcast?  You have a radio show.  You're going to do a podcast and a radio show?  I'm doing something.  Nice.  I'm doing things.  I'm doing things.  Hey, we got a Joe Piscopo bit that just came in. 
[02:42:00]  What up?  These guys are constantly making shit behind the scenes.  Want to hear this?  Is this bad?  Of course.  Hang on.  Oh, God.  Wait, wait, wait.  Easy?  No, not easy.  It's terrible.  Where is that from?  Belly button.  Yeah, it's not as bad as it's been.  Did you come in your belly button last night?  No.  You want some?  No.  It's not bad.  No.  Try it.  Get away from me.  See, now that you're like doing the kettlebells, you don't have as much rank in your belly button. 
[02:42:30]  It's kettlebell day.  It's not as deep anymore.  I'm very short today because yesterday was a kettlebell day.  And a bunch of pull-ups.  Yeah.  You should see him do pull-ups with the diapers.  No way.  Jimmy is an animal on the pull-up bar.  There's no way he does pull-ups.  Really?  I was surprised.  I don't do perfect ones.  How many pull-ups can you do?  How many?  I do different sets.  I did 102 yesterday.  Fuck you.  But not in a roll.  I did seven sets of 12.  Upside down?  A set of 10.  And then a set of 8.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[02:43:00]  You're fucking...  He's an animal.  Are you under?  No.  You're forward?  It's harder.  Under, like with biceps facing me, like my fist facing me, it gives me a little bit of a  pain in my elbow, almost like a tenderness in my elbow.  It's harder to do it this way.  He's an animal.  It's harder to do it.  It's amazing to watch.  This way.  And what do you do?  Just fucking...  You actually...  Yeah, but again, you look at them.  I do pretty well, but I don't do the exact military one.  How many do you get your chin over the bar each time?  In a row.  Close.  He said he did seven sets of 12.  How many do you do in a row?  Seven sets of 12, he said. 
[02:43:30]  What I'll do is...  I'm huge.  I'm telling you.  I'll do...  I've done 12 or 10.  In a row.  12 or 10 in a row.  Yes.  But again, you'll look at them and go, well, your arms weren't 100% down, or your chin just touched  the bar.  I don't do them perfect.  It's close enough.  It's pretty amazing.  I've seen it with my own eyes.  Is there a fucking, like, a fake dick on the bar to get you up there?  What do you mean fake?  He has his train to pull his cock out.  12.  Wow.  That's pretty goddamn good.  We've got to get a bar in here so we can do that. 
[02:44:00]  Is it just a plain bar, or is it the one where it compensates your weight?  It's the machine.  No, I hate those.  No, he doesn't use the weight thing.  I've seen it.  Amazing.  Ask me the questions.  I was an eyewitness.  I was amazed by it.  They're hard to do, man.  He does that, then he does some crunches, then he goes back on the floor and does some shit,  then he goes back to the pull-up bar.  I do it in between every exercise break I do.  He's an animal.  That's pretty great.  He's really good in the gym.  Jimmy's been the best shape of his life.  Let's go to Dr. Steve, who gives a fuck?  I am.  Dr. Steve.  I am.  Ah, breast milk flan. 
[02:44:30]  Dr. Steve.  I'm waiting to hear my riot cast plugs.  I already fucking said you.  You said you were the best show on the platform.  I just said it.  You fucking cock.  Needy.  Needy.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Dr. Steve.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Flood.  Flood.  Flood.  Flood.  Ay-ah.  I milk the women that are in my end-of-life care. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, what I do is, to make breast milk flan, you have to take some breast milk, and then  a little bit of toenail clippings in the graham crust, and a little fluid.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Pop assist.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Fluid.  Ay-ah.  What's the flan thing all about there, Dr. Steve? 
[02:45:30]  I'm sitting in the waiting room waiting to have a fiber optic scope shoved up my cockhole.  How's that?  Ow!  Why are you doing that?  What's wrong with you now?  Oh, uh...  Is it a prostitute?  He's rewarding himself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah. 
[02:46:00]  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  Ay-ah.  I had an episode of hematospermia, my friend.  Awesome.  That's blood in his cum.  Hematospermia?  He could just be passing a kidney stone. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, no.  What happened?  Is it constant?  No.  Yeah, I'm coming constantly.  I mean constant blood in your cum?  No, just one time, and I kind of blew it off because that can happen when you get to be my age.  And it'll happen every once in a while.  You get a little congestion.  We have to look forward to it in our 60s?  Fuck.  I can't wait until a girl blows me and has blood breath.  Insult to injury. 
[02:47:00]  People say bullshit on the 10 pull-ups for Jim Norton, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  That's tough.  A lot of people say bullshit.  I saw it with my own eyes.  Like you said, maybe a couple in there are a little sloppy, but in general, he's doing 10 to 12 fucking pull-ups.  Yeah, but if you had a fucking pussy with fruit bat wings on it.  Dr. Steve, you going to be all right or what?  Yeah, no, I think so.  I had an episode after that of what's called gross hematuria. 
[02:47:30]  The fuck is that?  What's that?  You just piss blood.  Oh, God damn it!  Was it dark blood or was it like light blood?  No, it was like red blood.  I'm getting woozy.  Could you feed a vampire with it?  Yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah.  I came bright red once.  Oh, my God.  Because you had beads.  No, my cum was bright red.  Yeah.  I had a little, Dr. Steve knows he pretty much held my hand through the whole fucking thing.  How dare you say the whole thing?  No, he's great.  When you panicked at three in the morning?  Because I had a prostate scare, and so they were taking samples, and then they warned 
[02:48:00]  me that, A, I would have the feeling of having to shit for 12 straight hours and having to  pee for 12 straight hours.  To our listeners say.  Which is, it was so fucking uncomfortable, I can't even tell you.  And then they warned me when I, you know, fucking ejaculate, as they put it.  It might be a little red.  A little red.  It was bright red.  I'm getting woozy.  Well, when they stick needles through your prostate, it parts. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  They start a needle.  Oh, yeah.  And, oh.  It punches the prostate.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, oh.  They have to withdraw some fluid.  When they did that, I actually whimpered, and the doctor actually held my hand.  Oh, just thinking about you, Bobby.  Hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand, man.  When they fucking put needles through the prostate and get samples, trust me, I let out a little  I was not happy. 
[02:49:00]  But bright red.  Not a little red.  Bright, dark red.  So you pissed out a fucking cup full of red jizz?  No, he's just peeing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jizzm.  Jizzm.  I was just relating with my jacked on it.  Oh.  Fluid ejaculation.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Steve.  Yeah.  Did you hang up on him?  No.  It's right here.  Look, everyone knows I did.  He's going to think I did.  He is gone. 
[02:49:30]  He's gone.  My hands were up here the whole time.  What happened?  What do you mean, Bob?  He probably had to go.  He said he was at the doctor.  We've got a timing issue.  Dana White in a few minutes, but first, this Joe Piscopo thing.  Not in studio, but he's calling.  I told you that.  I didn't know that.  What time is he calling?  Big fan.  Minutes.  Oh, wow.  So let's squeeze this Joe Piscopo thing.  Okay.  This bit they just came up with and brought in.  Calling in to your favorite radio show can be one of the funniest experiences there is.  Boys, how are you?  There's Joe Piscopo.  Joe Piscopo.  It's been so many years, sir. 
[02:50:00]  You can get your point across and have a laugh with the boys.  How long have we known each other?  Since the Eisenhower era?  Yeah, it was a long time ago.  It was a long time.  But sometimes, things can go horribly, horribly wrong.  Without the proper forethought, these dream calls become the stuff of nightmares.  Hey, Joe, you getting that young pussy now that you're single?  Hey, hey.  I'm trying to keep it nice.  Yeah, of course. 
[02:50:30]  Pleasant conversations turn to exercises and extreme humiliation on a national level.  And I wanted to plug, too.  It's Scotchdale.  Yes.  Tomorrow night, I'm at the Talking Stick Resort, which is going to be a plan.  Only the good places for you, Joe.  Joe Piscopo.  And that includes Jersey.  Why the obsession with Jersey?  I think because I was brought up here and everybody's got that work ethic.  Because after the Sandy situation, we all joined together.  It's too bad you didn't have a beach house.  A room full of silence can only lead to irrecoverable damage. 
[02:51:00]  So before you pick up that phone, remember, the next asshole could be you.  Hello, guys.  Hello there.  Come on now.  Where are you?  I got you.  A message from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  What happened? 
[02:51:30]  What happened?  Hello, hello, hello.  You guys need to put the fuck, man.  Hey, man.  It's a trilogy.  Yeah.  You have to watch all three parts.  That's true.  It does come together at the end.  That was part two.  Part three, you would be happy with.  What was part one?  Part one was making fun of his Showtime special.  Two hours of playing the special on this show and chewing it apart, stopping every few seconds  to just pick apart everything he did.  I actually, at the end of that special, I watched it.  I was in a hotel room and I watched it. 
[02:52:00]  I literally had to push my mouth shut because I was like, wow.  I was watching.  I woke up on my couch in the middle of the night and it was on because I had Showtime  on and it was just on.  So I got like one eye open and I'm watching and I had to get up and sit up and watch this.  I was stunned that this was on television and frightening.  He is so talented, kind of.  I mean, come on, dude. 
[02:52:30]  You're terrible.  He played every fucking instrument.  Yes.  Plays everything.  Yes.  Yes.  And then he does, yeah.  I got to interrupt because we got Dana White on the phone.  I will say this really fast.  December 24th, we're going to have the Joe Piscopo trilogy because it started with us making  fun of him.  His special, then the phone call, and then he came in studio yesterday, Bobby, and everything  was great.  That's great.  It's an amazing piece of work.  It's awesome.  Dana White, it's been a while, sir.  I'm so sorry about the other day, you guys. 
[02:53:00]  What happened?  I missed my time with you guys.  Oh, fuck.  I thought...  Dana.  Oh, you called after 10.  Oh, all right.  We got you now.  Yeah, we got you now.  And we're very happy about that.  Hey, I heard you may have been responsible in some way, shape, or form for getting me verified  on Twitter.  Yes, I was.  Are you verified now?  Yes.  Oh, I started following you.  Jimmy, you prick.  I didn't know it was you. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, some guy that followed me on Twitter, he's like, oh, yeah, I know Dana, and he could  hook something up.  I'm like, oh, cool.  And then the next thing I knew, the next day, boom, I got my check mark.  Are you taking over Twitter as well, Dana White?  No.  No?  No.  I'm just really close to the guys on Twitter.  Yeah, very good.  No shit.  I don't doubt it.  Dana White on Twitter.  Yeah.  Like you need more followers.  She's doing very well.  You give away a lot of gloves and cool stuff on Twitter.  Like if you meet me, it's always some Pinkberry. 
[02:54:00]  It's just an excuse for Dana to go to Pinkberry.  It's always like, hey, do you want to sign Carwin Glove?  It'll be under the Pinkberry thing I'm eating.  I asked for the Dana White at Pinkberry with the Fruity Pebbles, right, Dana?  Hey, I'm a Fruity Pebbles fucking Pinkberry guy.  I go, give me the Dana White.  And the guy goes, huh?  I laughed at Dana when he told me that the first time, and then I tried it.  Oh, it's the best.  It's the best.  Original, right?  Original?  I do original with the Fruity Pebbles.  And maybe a little fruit, a little bit, a little strawberries.  Oh, you go mochi.  I do go mochi.  What do you do, Dana? 
[02:54:30]  You go mochi?  Norton rags with me all the time about Pinkberry.  Why?  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with the guy who runs the most masculine sport on the planet  stopping off for a little Pinkberry before hitting the back.  Yeah, what do you put on yours?  I really do put Fruity Pebbles on it.  No, I know that.  But what else?  You get a few more toppings.  We all know that.  Unlimited toppings now.  Unless you go for the special ones where it's an extra dollar, $1.50.  I hate that they do that to us.  Me and Norton do Wonderberry now because it's right around the corner from my house. 
[02:55:00]  What's Wonderberry?  I've never even heard of that.  Yeah, it's owned by, I think, the Taliban.  It's owned by a Serbian.  Wow.  It's a small guy.  Pictures of Milosevic all over.  It's really a depressing place, but they're delicious.  Then you've got the mango people trying to do the Pinkberry shit.  The guy has 15 flavors, but only one of them works every day.  Oh, really?  He's not really in the business.  One of the toppings is dirt.  It's a cover-up for something else.  Yeah, this is delicious.  What is this? 
[02:55:30]  Borscht!  Wonderful.  It's human hair.  So, Dan, you're promoting the fights on Saturday, right?  Right.  Yep.  And on Fox.  On Fox.  This is going to be your best Fox one.  And the Fox ones have been good, but, man, this lineup card is great.  Best free fight ever on free TV, period.  I think so.  I think you're right.  Are you kicking yourself?  I mean, are you looking at this going, oh, my God, we could have made so much money off  of pay-per-view on this fight?  No.  We, you know, the deal with Fox is we're doing four live free fights on Fox a year, and they're, 
[02:56:00]  you know, every one of them are pay-per-view quality.  That's the deal.  And these guys are what, welterweights?  Which guy?  Diaz and Henderson.  No, these guys are fighting for the 155-pound title.  Okay.  Now, did you learn from, like, not, like, did you say you didn't want to have heavyweights  anymore on Fox if you could help it?  Because a lot of times the heavyweight fights are over faster because these guys just hit  so hard.  No, I mean, you never know what's going to happen. 
[02:56:30]  You know, when we did the Cain Velasquez-Junido Santos fight, the first fight on Fox, in a million  years, I mean, yeah, it could go the way that it did, but I thought that that was going  to be more of a war than it was.  We're doing the rematch of that fight December 29th in Vegas.  Oh, wow.  But, yeah, no, you never know.  Believe me, there's some fun heavyweight fights out there, too.  But this card, this card starts off with Matt Brown versus Mike Swick.  Yeah.  There's no way that goes to a decision.  Those guys are both knockout artists who stand up and bang. 
[02:57:00]  The second fight that people are crazy about, Rory McDonald versus BJ Penn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what we've been talking about a little bit.  Yeah.  This kid.  We were going at it yesterday at the press conference.  That is definitely going to be a fun fight.  Rory's amazing.  And Joe Gunhua versus Gustafson.  Oh, wow.  At the main event, which is Ben Henderson versus Nate Diaz.  Yeah.  Nate Diaz is, I mean, Nate Diaz is kind of, I mean, because his brother's been out, I mean, 
[02:57:30]  just as good as his brother now.  If not, maybe, you know, better.  He looks better and better every time he fights.  His last couple of fights have been amazing.  And this is going to be a real good fight with Ben Henderson and Nate Diaz.  One of my favorite things that Nate Diaz ever did, he got a guy in a triangle, knew he won  the fight, and he just gave double fuck yous to the camera.  Like, fucking what's up, motherfucker?  It was like, are you shitting me?  And then you see the guy tap out, you know, oh, what an embarrassing reel for that guy. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That fight's going to be great.  But Rory is like a, this kid is like the new fighter.  I mean, he's just a, I mean, BJ's the prodigy, but he came up knowing, you know, jiu-jitsu  and came in and won two titles at two different weight classes.  But now this guy is the new fighter.  He's like the John Jones who came up knowing it all.  Even GSP called this kid the new GSP.  Wow.  I was impressed, by the way, with St. Pierre in that last fight. 
[02:58:30]  I could not believe how amazing he was in that last fight.  Yeah, GSP's great.  Great fight.  Yeah, but I mean, I expect him to be good.  He was in the fight right before that, too.  What was the fight right before that?  Because I did see it.  Johnny Hendricks.  Oh, God, yeah.  He did.  Martin Camden.  Yeah.  Is he pissed that he's not getting.  The guy knocks people out so bad they skid across the office.  It's like a hockey fight.  Now, is Hendricks, is he mad that he's not getting the GSP fight and Diaz is getting that?  Nick's getting the next fight? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  You know, so when, basically what happened was after the fight, George St. Pierre said, you know,  I'm going to go on vacation and figure out what I want to do when he came back.  And when he came back, he said, told us that it feels like he has unfinished business with  Nick Diaz.  He wants the Nick Diaz fight.  George St. Pierre's been our champion forever.  The guy's never asked for anything.  He wants Nick Diaz.  We'll give him Nick Diaz.  And, yeah, I saw yesterday that Johnny Hendricks was tweeting that, you know, he wants to fight. 
[02:59:30]  And, you know, I understand.  But, listen, Johnny Hendricks, first on the scene, he's had some great knockouts in the  last couple fights.  He can fight another fight and wait until this GSP Diaz fight happens.  And then he'll get the next shot.  Yeah.  Right now, I think that Diaz is a bigger fight, even though Hendricks is great.  But, you know, he can wait one more fight.  Yeah, if Diaz can stop fucking toking on a bong before he fuck in, you know what I mean?  That would be nice, yeah.  That would be nice.  You know what it is?  It's like the more animosity that builds up. 
[03:00:00]  It's amazing how many great fights you guys have.  Like, every time there's a card, there's at least one fight on there I'm dying to see.  It's like with boxing, what is there, one every two years?  It's a big fight.  And it seems like you guys are just doing them every other month.  You have a fucking huge fight going on.  Thanks, man.  And you realize, too, last year, it was a crazy year for us.  You know, even though with the Fox deal and, you know, all the success that we had,  we lost eight of our 12 main events due to injury.  Wow. 
[03:00:30]  Eight of our 12 main events due to injury.  And then even we're going out the same way we came in.  The December 29th card has been switched around already so many times.  We had Forrest Griffin fall off that card.  We had Weidman fall off that card.  And Gray Maynard fall off that card.  I mean, all due to injury.  It's been such a crazy year with injuries.  And what about, how's Carwin?  Carwin, too.  Well, that was the ultimate fighter.  Him and...  Yeah, how was he doing, though?  You know, he was completely depressed. 
[03:01:00]  I talked to him a couple days ago.  The guy's in a total depression, you know?  Why so many injuries lately in training?  I don't know.  It's just crazy.  But it's been such a weird year for us.  And I hope this shit ends in 2013.  Aren't they...  Some of the fighters, though, starting to train a little differently?  Like, they're kind of looking at...  I'm going to take care of my injury.  I'm not going to push myself as hard.  And, you know, because of what these people are doing?  It's not that.  A lot of people were saying, you know, a lot of speculation that, you know, 
[03:01:30]  for the first time ever in combat sports history,  we're the only company to ever provide health insurance for fighters.  Our fighters get health insurance.  So everybody was saying, oh, it's because they have health insurance now,  but they're...  Believe me, whether you have health insurance or not,  doesn't stop the fact that you blew your ACL out.  You know what I mean?  It's just...  I think back in the day when we had Matt Hughes, Chuck Liddell,  Tito Ortiz, Randy Couture,  you had some of these guys out there that were so dominant, 
[03:02:00]  and they came from these camps where they were the toughest dude in camp.  Now they have these camps where, you know,  they have 10 killers training for fights at the same time.  Remember back in boxing when, like, let's say Oscar De La Hoya was training  to defend his world title?  Hello?  Hello?  He's playing a silent game with us.  Dana's phone was kind of being...  It sounded like he was a little choppy there, and then it just stopped.  Maybe it'll come back.  Dana, you can't leave us hanging with that one. 
[03:02:30]  That was a good one, right?  Yeah, it was.  Well, in the meantime, if Dana doesn't come back,  it is on this Friday, this Saturday night.  What time is it on?  Do you know?  On Fox?  What time is it?  I think it's 8 o'clock.  Is it 8 o'clock?  I am.  It's Fox 5.  Fucking dying to see this.  This is going to be a great one.  This card is amazing, man.  It's fucking incredible.  For free.  I can't believe it's free.  Yeah.  The BJ Penn fight, I hope he...  I hope...  I know BJ's going to put up a fight, but I would love to see him come back and win. 
[03:03:00]  I like Rory.  I want to see Rory being...  Yeah, Rory, he's an American psycho, dude.  I mean, he is the neatest dressed fucking guy on the planet.  Doesn't he have one loss only?  I think he's only lost one fight.  He lost to...  Oh, fuck.  What's his name?  He lost to Alconda.  Carlos Alconda.  Beat the fuck out of him.  Bobby really knows his shit.  Beat the fuck out of him.  Officially, Dana's gone.  That's the fight he wants.  He wants that fight back.  Yeah.  Yeah, because he's a different fighter now.  He trains with GSP.  GSP is helping him train for this.  He's his sparring partner.  He trains for... 
[03:03:30]  Helps GSP fight for his fights.  But, yeah, Carlos Alconda, he wants that fight back.  But this fight is going to be great.  I cannot wait for this fucking Henderson-Diaz fight.  It's going to do well.  Breaking fucking news, man.  Holy shit.  Remember the radio show in Australia that pranked Kate as she's in the hospital?  Yes.  And remember the receptionist that took the phone call in the hospital?  Fired.  Dead.  Whoa, wait.  What?  She killed herself.  No way! 
[03:04:00]  So now those guys are in fucking trouble.  Oh, fucking...  What a dummy.  Are you kidding?  How embarrassing.  It's just coming over the old wire there.  I wonder if they were going to fire her.  They were probably going to fire her.  Kate Hospital receptionist, who was duped by the Australian DJ's prank phone call, dies  in suspected suicide.  We played the call on this show, what, two days ago?  Wait, wait.  But it wasn't the receptionist that was giving the info.  The receptionist handed them off to a nurse, right?  So which one...  Is it the one that was heard a lot on the phone call, or the one right at the beginning? 
[03:04:30]  At the beginning.  She probably caught a lot of shit.  The nurse who was first to answer.  First.  She couldn't handle it.  They found her dead just a few feet from the hospital.  Hospital worker took the prank call.  Dana's back, though, too.  Okay.  Hey, Dana, that was you.  I'm sorry.  You were saying, remember when Oscar De La Hoya was training?  Yeah, that was weird.  I was talking.  I didn't even know I wasn't on it anymore.  I apologize.  I've had that many times arguing with women.  Huh?  They'd build a camp around him.  These guys would come in and help him prepare for the fight. 
[03:05:00]  But now there's these camps where all these guys are training together for a fight, and  they end up hurting each other.  And again, that's my opinion, but who knows why it's happening.  All I know is I hope it ends next year.  And what about, I mean, to just go off topic for a second, who is Silva fighting next and  who is Jones fighting next?  We're working on that.  Actually, I met with Anderson Silva.  He came to my office right before I flew to Seattle.  And we talked about a lot of cool options, man. 
[03:05:30]  I love, you know, first of all, Anderson Silva is the best fighter ever.  I love watching this guy fight.  I dread the day he retires.  And it's not a money thing or anything like that.  I love to watch this guy compete.  What people don't realize and don't give him enough credit for, he's 38 years old.  Wow.  He's still destroying everybody.  Yeah.  Like, it's nothing about this, right?  And the Stefan Bonner fight.  So, Anderson, first of all, Stefan Bonner weighs 205 pounds. 
[03:06:00]  Anderson's 185 pounds.  Bigger, stronger.  Then after the fight, you saw how he destroyed him in that fight.  Then after the fight, he tests positive for steroids.  Who, Bonner?  Yeah.  Bonner does.  Oh, I hear that.  Bonner was even on steroids and gets annihilated the way that he did by Anderson Silva.  The guy is just unbelievable.  I love to watch him fight, and the long-winded answer to your question is we're working with  him right now for his next fight. 
[03:06:30]  Now, the car, didn't you just give him, like, a fucking crazy car?  Yeah, we bought him a Bentley.  Jesus.  Holy fuck.  For Silva?  Yeah, the guy stepped up.  He took that fight on 36 days notice.  Okay.  Wow.  And that's...  I'll fight for Bentley.  Yeah, I'll fight.  I'll let Roy Nelson punch me in the colon for a fucking Bentley.  Right.  Now, would you be mad...  They say you don't really feel it when you get knocked out.  I'll fucking take a hit for Bentley.  Would you be mad if he took that Bentley and sold it, like, on the price is right and got 
[03:07:00]  the money for it?  No, it's his car.  He can do whatever he wants.  That's what the guy did on the...  What was that movie where they would just...  The guy would, instead of paying him, they just kept giving him cars?  The wood...  Sam Jackson did that in the fucking boxing movie.  I don't remember.  He's like, just get him another fucking car.  Hey, Dana, I'm a little behind.  Are you cool with Jon Jones?  Yeah, we're cool.  Everything's good.  I've been with him and Chael Sonnen for, like, six weeks now filming The Ultimate Fighter.  Right. 
[03:07:30]  It wraps up Tuesday.  Let me tell you what.  I've done so many seasons of The Ultimate Fighter.  Yeah.  And I know everybody's going to go, oh, he's full of shit because he's a promoter and he's  just that.  I said it many times this last season of The Ultimate Fighter.  It sucked.  You know, I...  Wow.  Roy Nelson was a horrible coach.  It just...  The guys weren't fighting.  This season that's airing right now with Roy Nelson and Shane Carwin, it's one of the  first seasons none of the guys, except the guys that made it, are fighting in the finale. 
[03:08:00]  Wow.  We didn't take any of the guys.  They're all gone.  This season, with Jon Jones and Chael Sonnen, Tuesday, this coming Tuesday, is the semifinals.  I can't wait to see these fights.  We have...  The four dudes that are going to the semifinals are so...  They're so badass.  It's going to be awesome on Tuesday, but there's this one guy that I think is going  to win it.  I'm telling you guys right now, if you haven't watched the season of The Ultimate Fighter in  a long time, wait till you see next season, there's a fucking guy on this show, every 
[03:08:30]  guy he fights goes to the hospital.  And I'm telling you...  Holy shit.  Every guy.  Not just like, oh, my shoulder hurts or out of my nose.  This guy fucking murders people, man.  Wow.  It's unbelievable.  And it's changing.  You're changing the night.  He's had...  Somebody's going to the hospital.  Wow.  Dana, you're changing the night, too, from Friday to Tuesday, right?  Yep.  Which is way...  I mean, way better.  That's smart.  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  Well, when we did the Fox deal, we were with FX.  First of all, you know FX has all this killer programming.  You know, they got Sons of Anarchy.  They got Justified, Always Sunny in Philadelphia, American Horror Story.  I mean, every night they have a killer show that's pulling big numbers.  Friday night was their night.  Well, Friday night is the second shittiest night on TV, right behind Saturday.  Saturday's number one.  Friday's number two.  Hot levels are down.  Males 18 to 34 are out partying or doing whatever they're doing. 
[03:09:30]  But still, when they put us on Friday night, their men 18 to 34 were up 67%, and men 18  to 49 were up 75% on Friday night.  So it was a home run for them.  But it wasn't a home run for me.  I want to be on a night where there's more guys home and more guys watching TV.  So these guys have been great partners to us already, and they're moving us to Tuesday  night.  That's fantastic.  I got to say, an observation.  The UFC is so great because you can hear the excitement in your voice still. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  You hear how excited Dana White is?  That goes a long way, though.  I'm up for Tuesday for the semifinals.  This next season is the opening finals.  When does that start up?  The next season?  Yeah.  When it starts, we start in January.  Okay.  I knew it was close.  Okay.  And is that, can I ask you a question, just because I'm a fan of the show since it started,  but the house that, is that, do you guys own that house?  Do you rent that house?  Because they seem to fuck it up every year.  Yeah, we rent.  Okay. 
[03:10:30]  We rent the house.  Hey, where can I watch, like, old seasons of The Ultimate Fighter?  Can I see that on the UFC website?  That's a good question.  You know, I know for a fact it's on DVD.  Okay.  I'll send you every friggin' DVD of The Ultimate Fighter.  Dude, I've been dying to go back and watch all of them because my DVR is taping them  messed up, so I'll tape a whole bunch in a row, but all of a sudden it will break the  chain I've been watching, and it'll show a fuckin' mid-season fight from season three.  It's really weird the way my DVR is not recording them properly, so I've been having trouble 
[03:11:00]  following.  It's driving me nuts.  All right, I'll send you every season on DVD, and I'm glad you said that.  I've got to figure that out.  If that's happening to you, it's probably happening to other people.  Because I watch, when I'm on the road, I'll buy the pay-per-views, and I watch them on  what, I don't know what your streaming is, but it's amazing that even with a mediocre  connection in the hotel room, I can fuckin' watch the fight.  It's like watching a 17-inch HD screen on my laptop.  Your streaming is, it's absolutely amazing.  Well, he's paying for it, I'm sure.  I'm sure he's paying for it.  But it's great. 
[03:11:30]  Some big bucks for him.  iPad yet?  What's that?  You can watch it on your iPad, too, and it's awesome on the iPad.  No, I haven't done that.  Yeah.  I've watched it on the iPad.  Yeah, it's great that you can watch the pre-fights right on your computer, on Facebook.  Exactly, because in between fights, you can just go to whatever other site you want to  watch, you fuckin' whack your bag for a couple of minutes, or you keep the fights up in one  corner, and in between rounds, you just fuckin', you know, whatever, you go to Pornhub.  All right, and let's plug the fight properly.  It's this Saturday night.  This is an amazing, amazing card. 
[03:12:00]  Henderson Diaz.  And it's 8 o'clock on Fox, and it's free.  Rory, BJ Penn.  Yeah, Rory, BJ Penn.  Showgun, who is fighting.  Showgun, Jesus.  What's the opening fight again?  It's Mike Swick and Matt Brown.  Which is great.  I mean, quick Swick.  This guy just came back, right?  He just fuckin' knocks people out in like 10 seconds.  That fight's gonna be a war.  Yeah.  Dana, what time?  It is...  We were confused by the time.  I want to make sure...  5 o'clock on the West Coast, 8 o'clock on the East Coast.  Yeah, 8 o'clock here.  Gotcha. 
[03:12:30]  So if you're not a UFC fan, or you're kind of up in the air, just watch this.  Don't fuck yourself?  Yeah, you're an asshole.  If you're not a UFC fan...  This is one of those opportunities.  If you've never seen the UFC, you've never made the decision to buy a pay-per-view, it's  live, it's free on Saturday night on Fox.  Check it out.  All right, good.  All right, man.  We'll talk to you soon.  Thanks, Dana.  Always a pleasure, brother.  Bye.  Dana White from the UFC.  I legitimately can't wait for this fucking...  I saw this fight, the promo for this fight, a while back on the internet, because I go  to those sites every day, and I was like, oh my... 
[03:13:00]  I was like, we gotta go to this, me and Norton.  And then it said free.  I was like, get the fuck out of here.  Why didn't we go to it?  I don't know, because it's free.  We could have.  Where is it?  Seattle?  Let's go to Seattle.  Let's get on a plane right now.  I can't.  I gotta get a kid.  Oh, that's right.  I got two kids.  We all have the fucking eye of the lizard.  All right, listen.  Thank you to Bob Kelly.  Thanks for having me on.  Good to be back.  What's the big plugs again there, Bobby?  Tonight at the Stanhope House.  Is Doug gonna be there? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, gosh.  Stanhope House in Stanhope, New Jersey.  Tonight, one show.  And you want...  I'm still giving the first...  Actually, there's only a couple left.  So if you want...  There's literally two pairs left.  If you want, you can email this info at catcharisingstar.com.  Two for one tickets.  I think there's two pairs left.  So if you want them, you can do that.  And tomorrow night...  Any apples?  Uncle Vinny's in Point Pleasant.  Two pairs left.  Tomorrow night.  Come down and support the club. 
[03:14:00]  I didn't even get that.  Oh, you fucking silly goose.  Tomorrow night.  Big fan gathering at my brother's restaurant.  Tomorrow night, FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  I'm gonna try to show up.  Yeah, I might go there, too.  I gotta blow off the Jew thing.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm supposed to go to a Jew thing.  A Jew thing.  What is it, Hanukkah or something?  Is it Hanukkah?  Who do you know that's Jewish?  I go every year to this Jew thing.  Who?  It's top secret stuff, Bobby.  Top secret?  I got some Jew friends. 
[03:14:30]  And they do their Jew thing.  Trying to bang this broad, Hendry.  I know.  So I got the Jew thing or the fan gathering.  So I think fan gathering wins over Jew thing.  Jimmy, you want to go together?  Um, well, as long as we're not going December 28th through the 31st, because I'll be in Buffalo  doing the Helium Club.  There's a Helium Club in Buffalo?  It's opening up, yeah.  No shit.  And April 11th through 14th, Caroline's here in New York.  Sounds great.  So I'm sure there's no buzz about me being here, but if you want to come, just watch.  Jesus.  Yeah.  It's just true. 
[03:15:00]  And you can always check out my podcast at riotcast.com, which is the greatest podcast network  in the world.  I, um...  Jim Florentine, Rich Voss.  I just listened to Florentine's latest one about Black Friday.  I love fucking Florentine's show.  He's very...  He gives a shit.  He doesn't like anything.  Why?  Why do you gotta shop?  He doesn't like anything traditional.  Gotta buy gifts.  Gotta buy some gifts.  Stop it.  It's cheaper online.  It's a lot easier.  You get a sweater.  You're doing...  What's the problem?  I got VHS tapes for my aunt.  Off with them in the stores. 
[03:15:30]  Like, what am I supposed to do with VHS tapes?  Add in Apes.  It's 2012.  And she's always like, hey, you gotta get me a gift.  Why?  Trying to watch football.  You wanna buy gifts?  If you're over 18, no more gifts.  Yeah, stop it.  See, I listen, Bobby.  See?  But then he said, actually, 20, because you might be in college and need a sweater or something.  Everyone's going at the same time to buy gifts.  Why?  Why?  It's stupid.  And they put a plan together.  You go to electronics, I'll go to clothes, and we'll meet at the register.  We'll meet at the register.

[03:17:00]  What if I get my own show, like on Tuesday?  10 o'clock.  You got it.  From 10 to 11.  You got it, Bobby.  Nothing else happening.  Yep.  That's it.  I'd love to do a show.
