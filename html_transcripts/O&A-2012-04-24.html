<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie and Jim Norton in the studio, Anthony being absent due to illness.  They started by discussing their upcoming show at the Hard Rock Cafe in Cleveland, worrying about a potential empty room due to scheduling conflicts.  Norton then regaled listeners with a humorous account of his frustrating clothing shopping experience in Soho, highlighting the difficulties of finding well-fitting clothes for his body type and his interactions with unhelpful salespeople. Opie chimed in, complaining about his acid reflux, blaming a carb-heavy French toast "breakfast for dinner."

The conversation then shifted to Norton's preparation for his upcoming stand-up special, including meetings with a stylist and tailor, and his choice of solid-colored shirts to avoid camera bleeding.  He also discussed his recent breakup, his anger issues during the relationship, and his reluctance to date again, reflecting on the intensity of his arguments with his ex.  The hosts transitioned to a broader discussion of the state of radio, criticizing the dominance of political talk shows, lamenting their #69 ranking in Talkers Magazine, and contrasting their style with the more structured political commentary. They discussed various radio personalities, including Rush Limbaugh, Howard Stern, Laura Ingraham, Rachel Maddow (and a lawsuit against her), and Joe Rogan's successful podcast.  This led to a discussion about homophobia in politics, referencing an article about repressed homosexual tendencies in openly homophobic individuals and an HBO documentary on gay politicians who legislated against gay rights.  They briefly touched upon the 2012 Presidential election, expressing their cynicism towards both Obama and Romney, and analyzing a clip of Rudy Giuliani seemingly contradicting himself regarding his endorsement of Romney.  Throughout this section, the hosts frequently used vulgar language and sexually explicit humor.

A voicemail from Jim Norton's mother, urging him to replace sex work with exercise, was played.  This was followed by a "Cock Talk" segment featuring a caller, Mars, graphically detailing his first homosexual experience. The conversation then turned to a photograph of Governor Chris Christie seemingly asleep at a Bruce Springsteen concert, sparking discussion about the ensuing media coverage and controversy, including clips from Good Morning America and Bill O'Reilly.  Christie's responses were analyzed and mocked, along with his handling of the New Jersey Nets' relocation. The hosts expressed frustration with their employer's lack of support regarding the Christie photo.  They also discussed their frustrations with Facebook and Twitter, their complexities, and a trending photo of a man with a very small penis.

The show continued with a discussion about a Yahoo News article listing things younger generations didn't need, leading to speculation about generational differences in technology and lifestyle. This segued into a discussion about advancements in technology, including computer graphics, medical technology (urine analysis, nanotechnology), and the potential downsides of self-replicating nanotechnology.  They contrasted the ease with which young children navigate smartphones with their own technological struggles growing up.  A humorous bit featuring Tom Papa's "Ted Lannister" character from a fictionalized *Game of Thrones* scenario followed, filled with sexual innuendo.  Discussions about the popularity of "Call Me Maybe," the hosts' Cleveland experiences, and E-Roc's emergency room visit concluded this segment. Tom Papa and Penn Jillette were mentioned as guests.

The next segment began with a discussion about courage, quickly transitioning into a critique of Sully's new book and predictions of poor sales. A vulgar discussion about penis size, sparked by a Twitter picture, ensued, along with "Uncle Paul" bits. Tom Papa was mentioned as an upcoming guest, and Penn Jillette unexpectedly arrived. Jillette shared a story from his book about a Hasidic Jew who became an atheist after listening to his show, including an offensive anecdote about a shared meal.  His appearance on Celebrity Apprentice, his experiences with other celebrities (Lisa Lampanelli, Lou Ferrigno, Adam Carolla, Arsenio Hall), and an encounter with a police officer after texting while driving were also discussed.  A story about a Las Vegas gun range concluded this segment.

Penn Jillette remained as a guest, the conversation beginning with a discussion about a previous segment involving Jillette and a comedian named Chip, whose jokes were deemed terrible.  Jillette then discussed his children's unusual names, Moxie Crimefighter Gillette and Z Penn Zoltan Gillette, explaining their origins and anecdotes. He also recounted stories from his experience on Celebrity Apprentice, his magic show with Teller, and the creation process of their illusions, including their "I'm a Little Teapot" routine.  After Jillette left, Opie, Anthony, Sam Roberts, and other show personnel discussed their exhaustion from Jillette's conversation style. They also discussed a picture of an Asian penis, child naming, and their opinions on celebrities. The show concluded with a Mother's Day advertisement and final comments, including banter about the intern, Jeff Spicoli.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  What the hell am I doing here?  Let's do this.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the O.P. and Anthony Show  right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  We are the kings of this type of radio.  No one has ever done it better.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Is it gay to titty fuck a guy?  Honestly. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  You bet I did and I came all over the place.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, everybody.  Yeah.  It's me and Jimmy today, which means it's grim in the morning.  Two tired guys and sick.  We're all falling apart as the big broadcast in Cleveland happens.  Jimmy is doing his special up there, obviously, Saturday night.  We're broadcasting live Friday afternoon from 3 to 7. 
[00:02:00]  I hear the club doesn't even open up until 4, by the way, Sam.  So you're going to be broadcasting to an empty room.  Somebody did call in the after show and said the Hard Rock has been telling people that the doors open at 3.30.  Oh, 3.30.  Really?  I'll be broadcasting starting at 3 o'clock.  And I want it to stay that way.  I want you to be broadcasting to an empty room at the Hard Rock Cafe in Cleveland because it'll serve you right, sir.  I can broadcast under any conditions.  Well, I guess you can.  That's why people hate you, I think. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  One of the reasons.  One of the many reasons, yes.  There's tons of them.  But you broadcasting to an empty room would rule.  At first, I was like, you have to be fucking kidding me.  And then I was like...  No, you got to just go with it.  I kind of want to do it.  I kind of want you to do that, too.  For a half an hour.  Because there's a lot of hype and stuff.  And people are really excited.  We're going to Cleveland for the first time in five years.  Then they're going to turn on their radio and just hear you in an empty room.  It's perfect.  It's perfect.  Because we're very confident these days in our ability.  So we don't need that shit.  Right.  We don't need to hear a big, live, over-the-top broadcast. 
[00:03:00]  Just you and echoes.  That goes.  None of the guys on the staff will talk to me, either.  No.  No.  But as...  He's talking about the empty room.  As the big trip nears closer, we're falling apart.  Anthony's out sick today.  I had horrible acid reflux last night where I was just going to fucking call it.  And now I'm talking to Jim.  You know, the second half of Grim in the Morning.  And you're tired, too, right?  I couldn't be more tired. 
[00:03:30]  I left here.  We left at 10 yesterday.  Yeah.  Pretty sharp.  I got home.  By 10.40, I was back out.  I was going to meet my friend down in Soho to get clothes for the special.  I wanted to get a, you know, a dressy shirt.  Nothing too crazy, though.  I'm not going to, you know.  Whatever.  I didn't know what I wanted.  And I probably...  I spent seven hours yesterday with my fucking awful torso.  I love...  Me clothes shopping, it's like lugging a fucking dead limb into stores. 
[00:04:00]  I went into Barbados.  And they have great stuff.  The problem is me.  The problem is not the clothes.  Soho has amazing clothes.  I thought of you a lot because I'm like...  Like, when you...  For Letterman, I'm like, you look good when you do Letterman.  Like, she got you guys good suits.  You're 5'11".  I'm like, I would kill to be 5'11 when I'm clothes shopping.  It's a fucking nightmare.  Why do you have to say I'm 5'11"?  I like to tell people I'm over six foot tall.  Oh, are you over six feet?  Yes, please.  I just think 5'11 sounds dishier.  You know what I tell people when I dress my wife nuts? 
[00:04:30]  I'm six foot with my shoes on.  And I mean it, too.  I'm not even trying for the joke that she just rolls her eyes and goes...  I tell everyone, I'm over six foot with my shoes on.  It's so hard to buy fucking clothes, dude.  You're in that weird shape?  I'm so ashamed.  I have to tell salespeople I'm misshapen.  Like, when they start to help me, I'm like, you don't understand.  I'm misshapen.  You think you understand, but you don't.  And they laugh and go, you know, we've seen it all.  And then they realize that you were telling the truth. 
[00:05:00]  It's a disaster.  Because it's either clinging to my fucking...  Like, the ones that...  Because it's all...  Soho should be called Twink City.  Yeah.  Because it's everything down there is built for slender guys.  Like, I went into a place called Suit Supply, which is really nice clothes.  I went into Ben Sherman.  I went into Bloomingdale's.  A few really nice places of names I don't remember.  And Varvatos was great.  The stuff was really nice clothing.  Did you try Rag and Bones?  No, I did not.  That's why I forgot.  I like the Rag and Bones.  But I don't like spending $250 per shirt. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, it's a little much, man.  What is going on with clothes?  I went clothes shopping yesterday as well.  I bought four button-down shirts, and it cost me...  And there was a sale, so I saved over $100.  It still cost me $370 for four shirts.  Do you try them on first?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I do.  Oh, yeah.  I got to make sure my bitch tits don't show too much.  Dude, that's the fucking thing.  You got to make sure the tits don't show, the sides... 
[00:06:00]  Like, all this shit has to be hidden.  I'm a little big up top.  It's from working out a lot.  I know.  It's actually tight, but it's big.  And if I gain a few pounds, or if I'm a little bloated, or if I have a little too much salt for dinner,  then the fucking water just fucking fills up my bitch tits.  Yeah.  Oh, Christ.  I've never thought of plastic surgery, but I would get that shit sucked out.  I've thought of it, yeah.  I work out all the time just to try to keep up. 
[00:06:30]  But with that said, yeah, so you got to make sure you get the proper fit.  That's what a good clothes shopping is.  It's like you're buying for warmth, to look good, and to conceal.  Like, you want to conceal.  So I bought eight shirts yesterday.  Okay.  I wound up going all to the same store, because Macy's has a brand called INC, which are like button-down shirts,  but they fit me well.  The black shirts I always wear in Leno, there's INC.  I have INC.  Those are the ones I like.  Good choice, man.  I have a couple INCs. 
[00:07:00]  There's something about-  I think they're a newer brand, because I've never heard of them before.  They're Macy's exclusive, I think.  We sound like girls.  No, a couple of men.  Men got a shop.  So you got some shirts for the big broadcast?  I bought eight.  I don't know what I want, and I took them all to the fucking tailor, because I'm a fucking  shrimp-armed zilch, and it's just-  So they're going to cut them and fit them nice?  Hopefully, yeah.  And I got to get my jeans done, too.  I wish you picked a shirt that gives everyone, like, epileptic seizures while they're watching  the special.  What would that be? 
[00:07:30]  Like, horrible stripes?  Well, you got to watch that.  It's called Bleeding on Camera, and the really weird small stripes, I think, do it.  And there's a bunch of shirts I liked, but can't wear them.  And I think if you shoot in HD, you're okay.  Yeah.  But I'm like, I don't even want to fuck with that, because there's nothing more distracting  than watching Bleeding Patterns on someone's clothing, so I go for solid colors.  I think you'll look fine.  She's got a shirt made.  Well, I thought you were the sweater boy cutie.  You're not going for a nice sweater?  No. 
[00:08:00]  I don't know.  I can't wear a sweater.  You can't wear a sweater.  I thought of it, but I look particularly fat in these.  I look better when I'm not in the sweater.  I'm very tired.  Seven hours, and I fucking napped for an hour, and then I woke up and just did my stupid  spot.  I'm tired because of acid reflux, which I get every once in a while, and I'll tell  you why.  I decided to live like E-Rock for a night.  Oh, no.  E-Rock, you got the best fucking scam going ever, man.  To not give a shit is the best thing ever. 
[00:08:30]  Did you stay up watching Family Guy and the Simpsons?  No, my sister was over helping out a little bit, and she goes, hey, I want to make dinner  for you.  I'm like, wow, that's really nice.  A nice little gesture.  She goes, what do you want?  I go, I want French toast.  I decided to do that breakfast for dinner thing that is sweeping the nation.  I'm not the only one that does breakfast for dinner every once in a while, right?  And it's a bad for you breakfast, too.  It's pretty much a dessert.  Oh, my God. 
[00:09:00]  So I had so much fucking French toast.  It's just carbs and syrup.  Yeah.  And I think if I have too many carbs, that's what brings on the acid reflux.  It was that big bread, too.  That challah.  What is it called?  That fucking...  E-Rock, help me out.  Challah?  Challah.  Is that some Jewish shit?  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  The Jewish know how to make some breads.  Challah is good.  Challah.  Challah.  And she made the thick French toast with the egg batter and the fucking maple syrup.  And that was dinner? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, do you think I had two or three?  Oh, and then she cut strawberries on top.  Oh, my God.  You're right.  It was dessert for dinner.  It wasn't even breakfast for dinner.  That's nice.  Did you go back for seconds?  I went back, and I'm not even exaggerating for the radio.  I had four helpings.  I felt like E-Rock last night.  God, what a life.  What did you drink?  I'm just...  Nothing, actually.  Because if I drink too much water before bed, I wake up in the middle of the night.  So I've got to be careful.  You don't drink water before bed?  I have to.  No, man, because then I have to get up in the middle of the night and pee and shit. 
[00:10:00]  This morning radio just fucking sucks.  You have to overthink everything.  I'm laying in bed at 250, just wide awake.  Like, why am I not...  What's wrong with me?  Really?  How has that happened?  How am I not asleep?  And I know why my voice has gotten deeper over the years, because it's the acid reflux just  burning the shit out of my vocal cords.  Do you ever feel it up in here?  Up in your throat?  You feel like you're going to puke?  Occasionally.  I think you have it worse than I do, though.  But I still get it pretty bad, but...  I got it all checked out.  I'm good. 
[00:10:30]  But, you know, I don't want this shit happening on a regular basis, because it sucks.  I'm tired, man.  So let's do a tired show.  I mean, we are.  No, but we have to do something.  What kind of something?  Like, what kind of activities would you do on a tired show?  I don't know.  Let's think about it.  You can have a nap time.  Ooh, you want to have nap times?  I'll never wake up.  By the way.  And I got a stylist coming.  I'm meeting a stylist.  As soon as I get home, I have to go see a stylist, and then go to see if the tailor has done  any of my clothes, and then maybe do my jeans. 
[00:11:00]  Because, again, I think it's just my arms that are fucking disproportionately snow.  Right.  Legs, too.  What is the stylist going to do for you?  Just, I don't know.  I did pick shirts.  Maybe just see.  I'm not going crazy with this.  You just want to look decent, and I'm so bad at this.  Because when you're shooting something, you just don't want to fuck it up completely.  Right.  Like, for Monster Rain, it was a black t-shirt and jeans, which I loved, but I want it to  be a little bit different this way, so it's just, it's a different look.  You want it to be visually just different.  Are you going to shave your head? 
[00:11:30]  I mean, the same as it always is.  Nothing different.  I like what it's looking like right now.  Yeah.  Because there's a little too much gray in it now.  No, it's not.  I'm going to dye it a little red.  Something fun.  Fiery.  I want to be a ginger for my special.  I like it.  Yeah.  It's not that gray, by the way.  Jimmy Red.  It doesn't look gray.  I hate it on the sides.  Really?  Yeah, I feel it.  It just makes you feel fucking old.  It looks distinguished.  That's what some people say.  Why don't you put a little medicine in there?  Because my scalp is right there.  It wouldn't do any good.  You're still young enough to put a little medicine in. 
[00:12:00]  I would in a second, dude.  I would dye my hair in a second.  Bob Kelly brought the medicine thing to our show for the new listeners out there.  Medicine is like, you know, coloring the hair a little bit.  But how do you do it with your hair that short?  Like, if you color your hair and it's really short.  I don't know, man.  I don't have fucking gray hair yet.  You have gray pubes?  A couple.  I wouldn't know.  Why?  Shaver.  That's right.  I forgot.  As soon as I see fucking buds.  You're a smooth boy.  Yeah.  I keep it nice, but I don't fucking go for the baby look.  I have to keep it completely fucking buff. 
[00:12:30]  Completely bare.  Doesn't that feel like sneakers on a rubber fucking gym floor when you're having sex?  Don't you need some movement down there?  Oh, no.  So the skin doesn't, like, catch?  Oh, yeah.  No.  I mean...  That's why the hair was put there.  So you can move around a little bit.  Probably, yeah.  But I...  No, dude, I don't...  You probably fuck better than I do.  I just lollygag through it.  Do you really? 
[00:13:00]  Just thrust.  Yeah.  Thrust.  Yeah, I just survive.  I'm just fucking pounding, just trying to get through it and not embarrass myself.  I hear you.  I think you're going to look great Saturday.  I just hope the show can survive.  Yeah, I think we'll be okay.  Well, then I woke up with some sneezing.  And I'm like, oh, am I, like, one day behind Anthony?  But I think I feel all right.  I think I might have given it to him.  I had it before him, before I left.  I felt it.  And then when I got to fucking Cincinnati, it was very...  It was Vic Henley.  Vic Henley started this shit. 
[00:13:30]  Because he came in under the weather.  Was he sick when he came in?  Fuck yeah, he was.  What an asshole.  So put him on the fuck list.  Okay.  Are you keeping track of the fuck list?  I started yesterday, officially.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  I feel like my head is buzzing.  I'm so tired.  Really?  I know nobody wants to hear this bitch about being tired, but it's like, it just happens.  You can't not be tired at this hour.  True.  You never fucking get used to this, dude.  I was thinking when you told me we were going to mornings recently.  You got off the train.  I met you at the train station, actually. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  And you had to come down to D.C. with Ant.  And you're like, we signed with XM.  I was so happy we'd signed.  And you're like, well, we're going to mornings.  I'm like, really?  I know.  I'm trying to talk you out of it.  I'm like, why?  I never wanted this.  Now we're eight years into it.  Seven and a half years into this.  And you're like, we got to do mornings.  We have to.  And you were right.  Things are going to change.  We got to change up some shit.  But what I like.  I love the people going, oh, you're all the bitching and stuff.  I'll laugh, you know, October 1st when you resign. 
[00:14:30]  It's not that easy this time around.  I'm telling you.  Things got to change a little bit.  It's still easy.  I mean, you know, this is honestly.  I want some.  I want some things.  Just a few little things.  Afternoons stunk because I didn't live when I did afternoons.  Like, at least now I get my shit done.  But when I was in the afternoon, at three o'clock radio, I'm back on stand-up schedule.  It means I'm going to bed at six in the morning.  I'm not fucking Ralph responsible.  Right.  If we're back on afternoons, I'm getting hookers at six o'clock in the morning.  And I'm going to bed. 
[00:15:00]  And I'm waking up at 220.  And rolling in at three.  And then not living.  Three is weird because it's just kind of in the middle of the day.  You can't, like, start anything.  And then by the time you're done, you can't really do much either.  Yeah, three is fun.  It's a weird fucking time.  But you're not as tired.  You're awake.  You kind of feel like you missed a lot.  Like, I always feel like I missed a lot when we were doing afternoons.  Now, at least, with the news we're on top of.  And, you know, you can do dumb work.  But go home and go to bed if I want to.  True.  Fuck the news, though.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Because we're going to do a tired show today.  Yeah.  We need activities for a tired show.  Maybe Iroch could read you a story.  Like, a lullaby or something.  Iroch, have you ever had breakfast for dinner?  I was thinking about you yesterday.  I haven't really done that in many years.  And it was just cereal if I did.  Breakfast for dinner rules.  I'm going to have breakfast for dinner once a week when my son can appreciate it.  I'm more likely to have dinner for breakfast than breakfast for dinner.  I don't like breakfast foods that much.  You know, like, I would eat breakfast food three days, three days, three times a day. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, no, I don't really like it.  It's just too bready.  There's too much bread.  What's wrong with you?  You don't like bread?  No, I like bread.  No, you don't.  Go clear that up.  But it's just when it's just bread.  I need a little something else.  You like breakfast?  Some cheese or something.  What are you talking about?  Breakfast isn't just bread?  Well, I don't like eggs, so it is.  That's the beauty of breakfast.  They fucking fancy up the bread.  Yeah, but it's just so bread.  There's no...  Like, you're talking about bread in general.  Like, pancakes would be the bread category.  Pancakes, waffles.  But pancakes should throw some shit in there.  Waffles rule.  You don't like waffles? 
[00:16:30]  Waffles rule with syrup.  I like waffles, but not...  I love bacon.  Okay.  I mean, I'll have bacon with anything.  You don't even like waffles?  I like waffles, but not like as a dinner meal.  Why not?  Dinner is substantial.  Waffles, a little butter on top, some maple syrup.  I'll have...  Throw some bacon on the side.  I love Eggos for breakfast.  Eggos?  What kind of douche eats Eggos?  Eggos are good.  What is it, 1978?  Who the fuck eats Eggos?  Try them.  They're still good.  Isn't Eggos like a waffle?  Yeah.  It's a waffle.  It's all it is.  It's a waffle for kids?  No, it's just a waffle you can toast instead of eating a waffle iron. 
[00:17:00]  You could toast fucking waffles.  Right.  That's what an Eggo is.  Eggos makes friends, too.  So why don't you just call it waffles?  What?  It's Eggos.  What do you rock?  Eggos makes French toast, too.  What's the difference between an Eggo and a waffle?  A waffle you generally make in a waffle maker.  An Eggo is a waffle that's already made.  It's just a pattern on the dumb thing which makes it a waffle?  Isn't it the same shit?  An Eggo is a waffle that's pre-made and you put it in a toaster.  A waffle is...  A waffle is batter and you put it in a waffle maker.  No, it's not. 
[00:17:30]  You could get pre-made waffles and you throw it right in your toaster.  What are you talking about?  According to E-Rock, Eggo makes that, too.  Eggo started that shit.  No, they didn't.  But waffles started that shit.  Waffle?  Eggos are a brand of waffle.  Waffles were around before Eggos.  Right, but Eggos are the brand of waffles.  It's like Tupperware in plastic containers.  Does an Eggo look like a waffle?  Yeah, an Eggo is a waffle.  Then it is a waffle.  So let's drop the Eggo name.  No, that's the type of waffle that I like.  I want a fucking Eggo right now more than I want oxygen. 
[00:18:00]  They're so good.  But I can't have one.  Why?  One Eggo?  They're thin.  They're not going to gain weight.  No way.  They're four days out.  They have blueberry Eggos.  No, but you can still do a lot of damage in four days.  Sunday night when I'm back in New York, I'm going to go out and have a nice dinner and  treat myself.  Strawberry Eggos.  Next Monday morning, I'm going to be fucking...  Chocolate chip Eggos.  With that, I'll probably have gas.  Oh, I had fucking...  Because I'll be eating a nice Sunday next Sunday.  This lady where I was shopping, she's like, you want to try some jeans?  We've got some good jeans.  And I'm in the dressing room as she's saying that, and I'm shirtless, and I'm so bloated. 
[00:18:30]  I look like I'm pregnant.  Why were you...  Hence the acid reflux.  I guess my whole body has just get...  Dude, my belly was so far out.  Why were you bloated?  What did you eat before you went?  I don't fucking know.  I don't know what caused it.  I did eat some shrimp that might have been a little old.  Maybe I gave myself food poisoning.  Oh, wow.  Won't you...  I smell every...  Oh, I smell it.  It smelled all right.  It smelled all right, but I was so bloated, and she's outside the dressing room with jeans. 
[00:19:00]  I'm like, ugh.  I'm just like fucking going, ugh, to myself in the mirror with my big bloated belly.  Oh, it's the worst feeling.  You know how awful jeans look when you have a bloated belly with everything just hanging over the top?  Did you buy jeans?  Hell fucking no.  I just bought a few shirts and got the hell out of there.  I, uh...  Me and Kenny were fucking recently in a gig, and we were having shrimp cocktails together,  because Kenny loves a good shrimp cocktail.  I know.  That's what...  That's the bane of his existence. 
[00:19:30]  That's Kenny's thing.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Kenny eats shrimp cocktail like a girl eats shrimp cocktail.  They both smelled bad.  Oh, they smelled bad.  Yeah, there's a really weird smell.  You just know.  You just know.  And if someone's like, what's it smell like?  It wasn't necessarily too fishy.  We both sent them back.  It's like, never fuck with that stuff.  It just smelled wrong.  I had a bad, uh, baked clam recently.  Do you smell each one before you eat it?  Fuck yeah, I do.  I love seafood, but I smell that shit.  And how did you eat it, then, if you smelled it? 
[00:20:00]  Um, you know what?  I didn't smell the baked clam.  Now, you just called me out on that.  You're right.  I usually do smell, but I...  Oh, you know what it was?  Because it was baked clams.  I'm thinking, ah, it's cooked.  I don't have to smell it.  Because it's baked, right.  It's usually when it's raw or shrimp, I definitely smell it as well.  But I did not, Jimmy, because it was baked.  You're right.  And then it just tasted funny.  I'm like, ah, fuck.  You spit it out?  Hell yeah.  But then I ate the rest of them because I smelled the rest of them, and they were all fine.  Yeah, for some reason, usually a clam...  You just get a bad clam every once in a while.  Yeah, it's not going to be like fucking ten of them.  Bad clams don't just hang out. 
[00:20:30]  They're like a gang.  Clams are like pussies.  Yeah.  You're going to get a bad one every once in a while, but it doesn't mean you're going  to stop eating pussy, right?  Absolutely.  It means I'm actually going to eat more of it.  Oh, my in-laws are listening right now.  Fuck.  Turn off the radio.  They know you eat pussy.  You don't have to listen every morning.  They know you eat it.  They're aware.  It's okay.  You don't have to listen every fucking morning.  If I was you, that's all I would talk about until I stopped listening is cock sucking  and pussy eating box.  I save my edgier stuff when I know they leave the house.  Oh, God.  I never...  No, I'm joking.  I don't care.  In the end, I don't care, and they don't care. 
[00:21:00]  They're cool.  My family is herds.  I've had so many of those awkward discussions.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Or the voicemail that your mom left about the ladies of the night.  Oh, it was 2003.  Yeah.  That's 2003 already?  Yep.  Well, it's good to know that you changed your ways, and you don't really do that anymore,  and you settled down with a nice lady, and...  I'm a single 10 months.  I know.  10 months without a girlfriend.  And my ex is still one of my best friends.  She's one of my favorite people.  We just...  Dating was rough.  So, why don't you maybe do some of that couple's therapy? 
[00:21:30]  She kind of...  My therapist thinks I needed that, but I don't know, man.  It got...  The fighting got so bad, I just...  It changes things.  And it's almost like when I got as angry as I've gotten, it's my problem that I got that  mad, but it frightened me.  Right.  It really scared me, how fucking angry I got, and I cannot do that again, and...  That means you might not be able to be with anyone.  No, because...  Because you're going to have your issues when you settle down with somebody, and if you can't 
[00:22:00]  handle it without that major anger, that could be an issue.  I thought of that.  Like, because the problem is me.  My anger is my own thing, but it was so bad.  Mm-hmm.  But then again, the way she was handling it was not good either.  Like, I look back, like, stepping back from it, it's like, I'm not just going to...  I'll blame myself, but not for everything.  Like, eh.  Nah, she could have...  She was awful with this and this and...  Whatever.  She's still one of my favorite people.  You guys are great together.  Sometimes, yeah.  We weren't fighting.  We were...  Well, I didn't see you guys a lot, but when I saw you, I liked how you guys were together. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  I mean, she makes me laugh, and she's still...  You know, she was dirty and funny and fucking...  Yep.  It's one of those things, man.  It's not...  The idea was I was afraid I was going to go to jail.  I'm like, it's going to get...  I'm like, you're going to spend time in prison if you don't leave this relationship.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I...  A lot of guys get in those and know what I'm talking about.  Anytime a violent episode happens, I've never had a physical altercation.  But with her, I was scared, because she didn't hit me, but we were yelling, and she, like,  kind of hit my arm one time, and so I could just see that. 
[00:23:00]  Escalating?  Yeah.  And I'm like, then I don't trust myself.  Like, will I get mad and...  Or will I just break something I value?  Like, I have a lot of stuff that I love around my stupid museum apartment, and I would be  scared that she would break...  She said she never would.  Yeah.  But I'm like, what if she freaked out and broke something...  True.  ...that was irreplaceable to me?  You would lose your fucking mind.  I would lose my mind, and I would hate her, and I would, you know...  She knew how to push your buttons, I guess.  She did.  She never did that shit, though, yeah.  I think women in general know how to push your buttons, so... 
[00:23:30]  That's the beauty of them.  They do, but I mean, anybody you date is going to know how to...  Yeah.  Get to you a little bit.  Yeah.  And I know how to get to her.  But it's like, you feel it when it's like fucking...  You feel when you're gearing up into one of those arguments.  It's really weird, like, a mild discussion in the darkness.  No, no, no, no, and then it's like a body shift.  It's like, she's laying there, and you're laying there, and then you, like, turn, and 
[00:24:00]  you turn up on your arm, or it's like a weird aggressive posture in your sleep, even.  You feel yourself...  Yeah.  You feel that change happen, and then it's just a nasty fucking argument.  You start to feel like you're better off just being single?  No, I mean, yes and no.  I mean, because I like this...  Like, she'll hear something on the radio.  She doesn't listen to the show once in a while.  Like, she'll go to YouTube from something else that got directed.  Like, usually it's a chip bit or some stupid shit. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  And then she'll ask me questions about it, and I'll get annoyed.  It's like, no, that's not what that was.  Right.  And then I just get defensive and irritated, because to have to explain the radio job, I fucking  refuse to do it.  Right.  It just, it's like...  Yeah, I...  It drives me nuts, because it's like, you like the way we live, and...  You like the life it provides.  Don't ever tell me what I can say.  Oh, my ex was so fucking jealous of this radio show, and would just always be like...  I'm like, you shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  Look how you live, you dope. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Shut up.  I'm a good guy.  I'm a loyal fucking guy.  I'm a trustworthy guy.  Shut up.  But to have to explain, complimenting other women.  Oh, all that shit.  That's why I, you know, I've had a...  I did this to myself.  I've always had kind of a, you know, don't touch rule.  You know, that's our...  We get to see naked women on...  Not anymore, really, because it doesn't matter.  But back in the day, yeah, we had naked women on a lot.  I didn't fucking touch or fuck any of these chicks. 
[00:25:30]  And my broad would be out of her mind about it.  I'm like, look how you live.  Shut up.  That's the only way to handle it, too, is to say that.  Right.  Shut up.  That's it.  You gotta know the difference between the guy that's on the radio trying to entertain people  and the guy you fucking live with.  Wake the fuck up.  The second you go...  We're not like this...  We're not completely like this when we're not here.  There is a difference.  The second you go, well, yeah, no.  Like, the second that happens...  Right.  It's fucking finished.  You can't do it. 
[00:26:00]  You can't.  Right.  I mean, I'll respect boundaries and names and, like, identities.  I never break that.  But you can never worry because once I start worrying about what a girl is thinking or  whatever, the implication...  It's like worrying about offending someone.  Like, well, I shouldn't do a Jewish joke.  But then again, what about black people?  Then again, what about gay people?  Then again, what about women?  It just snowballs and then there's too much shit to worry about.  And I can't function and be fucking funny on the air.  I can't be myself on the air.  Yeah, fuck that filter shit, you know?  I don't even... 
[00:26:30]  I don't go home and think twice that there's going to be a problem at home because of something  I said on the radio.  It's a good feeling, you know?  Because my ex was all about that.  I'm like, just shut the fuck up.  Jesus.  Well, we listen sometimes.  Like, what's worse than when you're with your chick and a replay comes up or it happens  to be on in the car and you hear something, you're like, oh, fuck, this is when the girls  came in.  I don't know. 
[00:27:00]  You know where it's going.  And you're like, I complimented their pussies.  I know.  I'm going to hear shit about this.  And then that part comes up and you're like, fuck.  I don't listen to the show anymore.  I used to be obsessed with listening to the show to make sure everything was cool.  How did it sound?  How can I improve my part of the show?  How can I improve the show in general?  All that shit.  And I had to let it all go.  I don't even have our channel in my car.  I just don't want it. 
[00:27:30]  Is that because you're confident or because you don't want to make any more...  I know we put on a good show every day, but I don't need to hear it anymore.  So you don't need the security.  No, I need to get away from radio more these days.  How come?  I used to be like a fucking...  I used to be stupid E-Rock where I had to listen to a bunch of shows and see what everyone  else is doing and making sure we're still the best out there and all that crap.  You can't do that.  I've got to live my life now.  It's hard when you start comparing yourself to other people.  I never compared myself to other people.  I just wanted to make sure what was the competition I'm doing. 
[00:28:00]  I literally...  I care something...  I'll listen to a bit.  Like, you have a bit I listened to last night because somebody referenced it.  We talked about Sully.  Yeah.  I listened to the old Sully's book break.  We were going to find Sully's books.  It made me laugh.  Like, I'll go to YouTube once in a while and find an old bit if someone reminds me of it.  And YouTube is so great.  It's like...  I'll do that.  You just go find the bit and I'll have a laugh, but...  I will do that.  Every once in a while someone will tweet me with, you know, a bit or something.  I'll go, oh, yeah, that.  And I'll listen on my way to the gym or something.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[00:28:30]  But in general, no, man.  I don't even have the channel in my car.  There's plenty of other stuff I'll listen to on Sirius XM.  I'll listen to this.  I literally listen to Ozzy's Boneyard.  I don't go...  I don't listen to much radio.  It's mostly the iPod.  Pearl Jam Channel.  I wouldn't know where that was if you put a gun in my fucking head.  I like the Pearl Jam Channel.  Absolutely.  I have no idea where...  I've never even hit it accidentally.  Classic Rewind.  I wish there was a better way to scroll through channels, like on a radio in general.  Like, Michiukaku, who we've been teasing lately, but he did a fucking one-hour thing called The World in 2030. 
[00:29:00]  It was a lecture he gave.  And, you know, he starts off with his typical silly, you know, little silly jokes.  But then he gets into where we're going and the way computers are getting...  This is called Moore's Law, where computers are getting cheaper and cheaper.  And he starts from when NASA, compared to the iPhone and the cost and the size.  And by the time 2030 is here, he's saying that we will have, like, sheets of paper will be computers.  Like, computer chips with that will be literally a nickel because the cost will be so cheap. 
[00:29:30]  So you'll be doing all of your work just on these little disposable computers.  And he was explaining how you'll bring your hard drive everywhere with you.  You won't have to just have it in one place.  And one of the things, I'm thinking how great radio will be, just to have that all open in front of you.  And not have to go, like, I just can't wait for these fucking advancements.  Right.  I can't wait.  And radio is one area. 
[00:30:00]  He wasn't talking about radio, but it just made me think.  Look it up when you have time, an hour to kill, 2030 Dr. Cocker.  It's really, really interesting.  Is it a podcast?  Because I'll check that out.  No, no, no.  It's a visual lecture he gives at a school.  Really?  Oh, getting back to the radio thing, which goes to your point, the reason why I don't monitor any radio anymore is because I've heard it all now.  There's nothing out there.  There's literally nothing out there.  The Talkers Magazine just did their top 100, and I guess we made the list at 69. 
[00:30:30]  All the big radio shows are just political shows.  That's what radio has become.  They're just all political shows.  The top 10 are Rush Limbaugh-type radio shows.  That's why you're listening to podcasts now.  Huh?  Yeah.  You're taking a look at what's going on there.  I'm digging the Joe.  I'm all about Joe Rogan's podcast lately.  It's fucking good, man.  Yeah, I've done it once.  I've never heard it.  Joe Rogan's podcast is fucking good.  I will give him the top spot in the podcast world, and I've heard all of them.  I like Jay's, absolutely.  I like Bill Burr's, absolutely. 
[00:31:00]  I like Voss and Bonnie, abso-fucking-lulu.  And Bobby.  And I haven't heard Bobby's in a while, but I like doing Bobby, so yeah, I'd put him on that list.  And Marc Maron, sure.  But top of the list, man, is Joe Rogan's podcast.  It is fucking good.  Yeah.  That shit would have been a huge radio show back in the day.  A huge radio show.  But it's becoming a huge podcast, and it's just as good.  Right.  I mean, it really is just as...  I've been thinking obsessively about podcasts lately.  It's like I'm looking into equipment and everything, but I'm not going to do what Ant did. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  I'm not going to do all that, just literally for my own thing.  Oh, yeah, nice.  You gotta.  You gotta, because that's where all this is going, no matter what.  That's why I try to tell these guys, we need a podcast.  Do it, put your own satellite.  No, the podcast world is blown up, so we should be part of that now to keep our names out there.  You should also be doing podcasts.  Like, literally, you should be doing Rogan's, Corolla's, and then have them.  It's like, you know, because they used to believe it.  They all want to be on...  Nobody doesn't want to come on the radio on the road, too. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  It's a great fucking back and forth.  I want to fly out to LA just to do Rogan's podcast.  You should.  Because I don't want to do it on the fucking phone.  But I want to sit in and fucking do his podcast.  And I might even do a hit.  I was about to say, would you smoke pot if you went in?  First time in many years, I might do a hit.  But then I would look like a dumb fucking fool.  That's the funny point.  That's the fun of it, yeah.  There's something crazy like that.  I want them to get really baked, and then I'll do one hit, and I'll probably be even with them.  What's the top 20, to prove my point? 
[00:32:30]  They're all political talk shows.  Rush.  Yeah, that's number one.  Savage.  He's down there.  Hannity.  Hannity.  Laura Ingram.  Laura Ingram.  Neil Bortz.  Neil Bortz, yeah.  Ed Schultz.  Ed Schultz, probably that stupid blowhard.  Yep.  Who wants to be Rush Limbaugh for the other side so badly.  I don't know who Dave Ramsey is.  Here, just go on.  This list means nothing to anybody.  Go from one to ten.  We don't have to.  All right, you did.  Yeah, number one.  This is why radio sucks, because it's all just political talk now, which is fine.  There's a huge audience for that. 
[00:33:00]  But what happens to guys just talking about shit?  Yeah.  It's gone on regular radio.  Rush.  Rush is number one.  Hannity, number two.  Mike Savage, number three.  Ed Schultz, number four.  Laura Ingram.  Laura Ingram, number five.  She's a sex...  I'm attracted to Laura Ingram.  Yeah.  I would love to have sex with her.  She's sexy, man.  Laura Ingram is fucking sexy.  Would you pop her shitter?  If she let me, I mean, I would rather...  Because she's like a really smart person, she'd probably be more fun to spank, because she's  probably much more into letting go at that point, like, she's, you know, because she 
[00:33:30]  really...  Yeah.  She's probably, she's normally probably one of the brighter people in any room she's  in, so she's probably tired of fucking bossing everybody around.  Right.  And when she has sex, she probably just wants to be spanked.  I hear a clip every once in a while.  I don't really know much about her show.  She's good, man.  She's not, I mean, I don't...  She's not hurt in New York, so...  Oh, she's not, right?  No, she's not in the New York market.  Didn't she used to be?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Is Dr. Laura still on fucking satellite?  Oh, remember that fucking deal they made?  What happened to that deal?  Oh, she's still here.  Wow, you'd never hear about her.  They spent millions on that fucking old broad. 
[00:34:00]  How's her show doing?  No one talks...  Literally, no one talks about it.  No one talks about it.  No one hired, and it just disappears.  No one talks about that show.  They gotta figure out the marketing department around here.  No one talks about that show.  No, that was supposed to be a big hire, remember?  Remember?  I can't stand her.  No, she sucks.  Dave Ramsey, number six.  Mark Levin, number seven.  Tom Hartman, number eight.  Who's Tom Hartman?  I don't know, but he spells his name T-H-O-M, which immediately makes me not like him. 
[00:34:30]  Of course.  Number nine, Glenn Beck.  And number ten, Joe Madison, the first colored broadcaster on the list.  Thank God you phrased that properly.  What about Tom Joyner?  Isn't he in the top?  Maybe he's not as influential as those guys, but he's pretty big, right?  Oh, Levin, Stephanie Miller.  Who's she?  Stephanie Miller.  I sort of started radio with Stephanie Miller.  She was part of Brother Wheeze's show.  They used to call themselves Brother Wheeze and Sister Sleaze. 
[00:35:00]  And she was the Sister Sleaze of the program.  And she stepped out of Wheeze's shadow big time, and she's a star.  She's really talented, Stephanie Miller.  Do you know her?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course I do.  And I'm just saying she's talented.  That doesn't mean I agree with her politically and all that shit.  So shut the fuck up.  No, I know, but it's annoying, these dummies out there that don't listen closely.  She had a TV show.  Yeah, I know.  She's good, man.  Stephanie Miller's fucking talented.  She's really funny, but I think she's kind of blown off the funny part of her whole personality 
[00:35:30]  and is more serious these days.  She's a very funny broad.  12 is Howard Stern.  He's got to be pissed about that, huh?  Because he just thinks he's the greatest fucking thing on planet Earth.  He might be happy to be in the top 20.  He ain't happy to be number 12.  You don't think so?  After all those political guys?  Give him a new thing to bitch about.  Neil Bortz.  Remember, Neil Bortz, 13.  Mike Gallagher, I love. 
[00:36:00]  You like Mike Gallagher?  I love him.  He's a really nice guy.  I don't know anything about Mike Gallagher.  He comes to my shows in Dallas.  He's a Dallas guy?  Yeah, he's from Dallas, and his son's a fan, and they come to the shows every time I go down there.  He's a really genuinely nice guy.  His audience is, I think, pretty conservative, but he has me on to promote my books.  Right.  He'll have me do call-ins, and he's a nice guy, man.  Mike's a really nice guy.  A lot of these guys are conservative talkers.  Alan Combs.  Why?  And they're all nice guys.  None of them are stick-up-the-ass guys.  Alan Combs is a really nice guy, but he's a bore. 
[00:36:30]  He was a bore with Hannity.  He's a bore on his own.  Nice guy, though.  Nice guy.  I've never heard of him.  You don't know the first thing about him?  He's that boring.  Jerry Doyle, 16.  17, Bill Handel.  Now we're getting into a territory of guys I've never heard of before.  Doug Steffen.  I don't know any of these guys.  18, Doug Steffen.  19, Michael.  Can't even fucking pronounce his last name.  Smirk Connish.  Smirk Connish, I guess.  That's terrible.  And finally, 20, remember Rusty Humphreys. 
[00:37:00]  These are guys we used to make fun of.  We're number 69.  Yeah, because it's all about political talk.  If you're not doing political talk, you're not that important in the radio world, I guess.  You want to keep going?  Dennis Miller has a radio show?  Yeah, it's fun.  Have you done Dennis Miller's show?  A few times, sure.  21?  Not a while, though.  He's actually not a bad radio guy.  He's a fucking...  Dennis knows how to do radio.  He does?  Yeah.  All right.  Surprising.  And Man Cow Radio.  25. 
[00:37:30]  Is he even on in Chicago?  I don't know.  Is he back on in Chicago?  I don't know.  But he changed his act.  He went political, and he was able to survive, I guess.  I think he's a fucking dick.  Always thought he was a dick.  All right.  We don't have to keep doing the list.  It just keeps going on and on and on and on.  We're way down at 69.  Who's above us?  Who's right in front of us?  Yeah, let's do that.  Who's 68?  And then who's 70?  Who could feel better then?  Oh, this list is just stupid.  One year, we were really high, I think.  Top...  Weren't we six or something one year? 
[00:38:00]  That was a K-Rock.  Jay Severn is 68.  O&A, 69.  70.  Mitch Album.  Oh, Mitch.  Boy.  Do you know Mitch?  His books.  His books.  Who's Mitch Album?  He used to work for ESPN or does.  I don't know.  And then he wrote that book.  What was the name of that book that was a huge bestseller?  I read it.  It was good, actually.  And then he decided he was an author and ended up writing three or four books that were just  horrible after that.  What about fucking... 
[00:38:30]  He was a one-hit wonder author.  Others would say differently because I think his books sell pretty well.  But what was the name of the big hit for Mitch Album?  Tuesdays with Maury?  Yeah.  Tuesdays with Maury.  Of course.  What is that about?  Old dude.  At the end of his life.  Talking about his life.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's been many years since I read it.  Is it fiction or non?  I think it's a true story-ish.  I think it's non-fiction.  Yeah.  Because it knocked Mick Foley's book off the list.  Yeah.  It's a true story-ish. 
[00:39:00]  How about Keith Olbermann fucking suing?  I was just thinking of him as just the people.  He's mentioned ESPN.  He's an asshole, too.  Well, yeah.  But he's suing...  He's hard to work with.  50 million, I think, he's suing Current TV for?  Yeah.  And Current TV's suing him.  They're like, oh, really?  Are they suing him back?  Yeah.  They're like, all right, let's get into this.  But so what happened to this magic relationship...  I didn't...  Between you and the ex-vice president of the United States?  Oh, I know.  What the fuck happened?  I'll be honest, man.  I used to watch him on MSNBC. 
[00:39:30]  He was, you know...  He was fun to watch.  I don't like the guy at all,  but he was just kind of fun to watch.  And MSNBC now just has a lot of really boring fucking people on that channel, so...  But is he going to...  Because I've been reading about...  He's fucked.  ...his lawsuit.  Rachel Maddow is getting sued by a guy.  That's an interesting...  Why is Rachel Maddow getting sued?  Oh, she's getting sued.  And it's by one of those guys.  Forget his name.  We can look it up, Sam.  He's a metal...  He used to do like...  He's like a Christian zealot, I think, 
[00:40:00]  or like an evangelical Christian.  Right.  And he does like a radio show.  And he had said, like, of course he's anti-homosexual.  Why wouldn't you be?  But, you know, that's who he is.  So he was quoting the Bible and Muslims.  There was something to that effect where they were saying that...  He was saying something about how Muslims want to execute homosexuals.  But Rachel Maddow and her show really did edit the audio.  Yeah.  Even though this guy doesn't like homosexuals, I don't think.  But they really did make it look like he said that he was for the execution of homosexuals. 
[00:40:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And I don't think he was saying that.  Even though I think this guy sucks, I don't think he was saying that.  Yeah, you can't do that to a guy.  You can't do it to somebody.  You can't do that to a guy on these shows.  Even a guy whose views are fairly repulsive, you can't do it.  Right, of course not.  So he's suing for a $50 million defamation...  Oh, no.  He's suing for $50 million and she's suing him for, like, legal fees or some shit.  They're going back and forth.  I was reading an article on homophobia yesterday. 
[00:41:00]  I actually was reading a whole magazine, but there was an article in there.  And there's a professor who basically said they did a study.  And they said the people that yell and scream about the homosexuals are the ones that are a little scared that they might have a little something going on in their own fucking heads as far as that goes.  And this professor did a whole study on it.  And he really believes that is what's going on with some of these people or a lot of these people.  Well, did you see the HBO documentary on politicians who have legislated against gays, but they're all fucking gay? 
[00:41:30]  Like, these guys, they get caught fucking getting massaged and blowing each other.  And, like, all they do is they go through...  HBO went through their voting record.  And so many of them were fucking, no, no, no, fags, no.  Right.  And, man, they can't get enough cock.  Right.  And it's like, there are guys who don't know they're gay, but guys that are fucking doing that and then going and fucking voting...  Right.  How do you live with yourself?  Yeah, that's twisted.  Being such a fucking horrible piece of shit.  That's fucking twisted.  But this professor did a whole study.  And, you know, a lot of times the people that yell and scream about it are the ones that are really scared about their own emotions. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  Or are already acting out on their own emotions.  Yeah.  Or it bothers them.  Or they have to...  Or when they're jerking off, their mind goes to a certain place.  And then as they come, they have to veer away from that because they're going to feel too guilty if they come thinking about balls in their face.  Right.  If they figure they'll fucking take it out on fucking...  It's just really irritating.  All right.  I've become radically fucking liberal with that.  It's just...  But it has come to annoy me.  I was feeling very conservative about a lot of shit. 
[00:42:30]  And I hated the fact that every entertainer just attacks the conservatives.  It's too easy a position.  And too...  You know, it's not a dangerous position to take to blast the conservatives always.  But they fucking just...  With that shit have just made me really hate them.  Right.  Yeah.  I can't fucking stomach it.  I just hate both sides.  Yeah, but this is just...  People like to pin me...  I love to pin them up.  For being an Obama guy.  I'm not an Obama guy.  It all started...  And he's obsessed with this. 
[00:43:00]  When it came about that he had a chance at the presidency, I'm like, holy shit, this guy's going to win.  And everyone told me, you're crazy.  They'll never, you know, they'll never vote in a black guy as president.  And I said, no, man, there's something going on out there.  This is going to happen.  And there was an excitement that came along with that.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  But in the end, Obama's a fucking nerd and he's just like the rest of them.  You know, he just is just like the rest of them.  I don't know who I want.  Like, I kind of...  Out of Romney and Obama?  Who gives a fuck?  Well, for Romney, I think it'll be better for Wall Street. 
[00:43:30]  I'm just thinking...  I think the stock will be doing better.  Oh, absolutely.  But it's like, I'm tired of that, too.  With Romney, you know, a lot of people will save a little more money.  Yes.  Yes.  But these guys are all full of shit, man.  Giuliani came out and, you know, America's mayor.  And he's endorsing Romney, right?  Of course he is.  This is a fucking...  They're playing it on a few of these channels now.  They're not going to play it on Fox, obviously, because that's just how this shit works.  They have a clip of Giuliani just killing Romney. 
[00:44:00]  Fucking killing him and saying this guy changes his mind on issues more than anyone has ever changed their mind on shit.  Giuliani, Republican, beating the shit out of Romney.  He comes out yesterday or this morning saying, you know, he's endorsing, because that's what you have to do.  In the end, you've got to endorse the main guy.  That's why I endorse him.  And then I'm sitting there going, well, really?  But he doesn't...  If you sat Giuliani at a bar and no one was around, he would probably go, I don't fucking like Romney and I don't want him, you know, as our candidate. 
[00:44:30]  But the problem is, like, Sam has a clip-up.  It's like, when is he lying?  Is he lying now during the debate or afterwards by endorsing him?  Because one of these two times, he's lying.  Right.  This is...  Well, this is when they were debating back in, what, 2008?  Seven, I mean.  And they all do it.  But you've got to get the clip where he just is...  He's part of a panel.  And basically saying, oh, God, this Romney guy is just not a good choice for us.  And now...  I'm sorry.  Didn't scumbag Santorum just do the same thing?  Didn't he just jump on him and endorse him? 
[00:45:00]  I hate it.  So who's the real guy?  You're endorsing him?  Or are you the guy that really doesn't think he's the right candidate?  Hillary said she would rather have McCain in office when she was going up against Obama for the nomination.  Right.  And then, of course...  They're all so predictable.  Not once...  Like, I like the fact that McCain almost went with Joe Lieberman.  I really did kind of like...  That would have been such a weird...  I think kind of a weird ticket.  I kind of wish he had done that.  Yeah.  I think they would have had a better shot. 
[00:45:30]  Joe Lieberman with that voice of his?  He's awful.  Oh, my God.  But he was definitely more qualified.  Yeah, he would have made it fun, I guess.  Yeah.  I kind of like when they crossed...  With that monotone cartoon voice of his.  So you've got to find the other clip.  I know MSNBC played it this morning because they're enjoying the fuck out of it.  Of course they are.  That's their thing.  You know, here's the guy that just endorsed Romney.  Look what he said, Amir.  I think it was like three months ago, four months ago.  So.  I don't buy endorsements.  I think endorsements...  If you need... 
[00:46:00]  Anyone that cares who somebody else endorses, you're an idiot.  If you care who your union endorses...  Well, maybe that's going to benefit you.  But if you care about an opinion of somebody, like a politician's opinion...  Right.  Like, I endorse...  I don't give a fuck who Jeb Bush or who Mario Cuomo or who any of these guys endorse.  Right.  Union's a bad example.  Why can't the individual think for themselves?  Right.  Exactly.  That's what they're basically telling everyone out there.  You can't think for yourself.  So if you like Jeb Bush, then you got to like, you know, Romney. 
[00:46:30]  It's so dumb.  The whole thing is dumb to me.  I know that's such a basic, you know, basic point, but it's just dumb to me.  I'm going to vote this year.  Who are you going to vote for?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  You got your two guys.  They're right there in front of you.  I'm totally...  I have...  I'm leaning more towards Obama, but I don't...  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I don't hate Romney.  I really don't.  I just think he's...  He's like...  I mean, that's how I feel about Romney. 
[00:47:00]  But I don't hate him.  I don't think he's a piece of shit.  I just...  Yeah, I think...  I don't know.  I think it just shows that our system, our political system is broke, that that's the  best the Republicans could come up with.  And, you know, you could say the same with Obama when that came around, sure.  But I think it's broke.  Yeah.  Romney was the best guy you could get?  That's kind of scary, man.  Yeah.  It makes me think there's a lot of really talented politicians out there that just don't  fucking want to deal with the shit. 
[00:47:30]  That kind of which one...  That comes with the office.  Ron Paul, I mean, he never would have won, but goddammit, he makes it fucking fun.  Yeah.  I would love him to be...  He tells it like it is.  Whether you like it or whether you agree...  Wow, I'm seeing a cool car crash, car chase on TV.  Starting point, chase goes to dogs.  And then they cut back to the anchor.  Could we want to see her?  Yeah.  Come on, man.  Show the rest of the video.  Ron Paul just speaks his mind.  I like that.  Yeah.  I like that.  Whether you agree or disagree, you know what he's thinking. 
[00:48:00]  You know, Romney, you go, is that really what you're thinking now, or are you trying  to get a little more votes over here?  What's going on?  Please tell me.  I would guess that Ron Paul does not like gays, but I think he edits himself on that  issue.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think he's a really religious dude.  I don't think he...  They never like gays, and I think he just kind of edits...  He's smart enough to know that you just don't want to...  That's a big issue, right?  Yeah.  Is this the clip, Sam?  Hopefully.  Before we go to break, so this is Giuliani, a mere few months ago, talking about Romney,  but today he's endorsing the hell out of him. 
[00:48:30]  I think he'll make a fine president.  I said to those Reagan Democrats, where you won't have this barrier of possible elitism  that I think Obama could exploit pretty effectively.  That was from our file tape.  Joining us now, former mayor of New York City and former Republican.  I think it's coming here.  Oh.  Is it...  This should be it.  Try it.  Because it was when he was on set. 
[00:49:00]  And I remember the Carter White House.  Nah, it's going to take too long.  Maybe if someone could edit it down the hall, we'll have it after the break.  I just find it fascinating.  And before you politicize it, trust me, both sides do it.  I could easily acknowledge that.  Do you know how many did it?  They all do.  They're all fronts.  They just all do it with their endorsements.  Like, really?  You were beating the shit out of the guy?  So now you think he's the right man for the job?  That's crazy to me.  That's crazy talk.  Like, you're that much of a whore to your party?  Right.  The guy on your side is always better. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  That's how you know they're all such twats.  How about you just don't say anything?  You already said what you think of the guy.  Just leave it at that.  Yeah.  Keep your honesty.  We're going to go to break with the famous Norton's mom voicemail.  To show you that Norton's life has drastically changed since 2003.  I'm much better now.  All right, man.  You're listening to Grim in the Morning.  Hi, sweetheart. 
[00:50:00]  It's mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here.  But we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening, which is a wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs.  And, you know, just for like 20 minutes to a half an hour, and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also, there's gyms in New York. 
[00:50:30]  You could go.  You could exercise.  And you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  And you relieve, you know, tension and stuff.  And you'd be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just am thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling.  So don't get offended or think I'm strange.  But I am a mother, and I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything's falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing. 
[00:51:00]  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on.  I know it's not my business.  But, anyway, I love you, and I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  But, anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas, and I really hope you can make it.  And, anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie?  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  This is the Opie Anthony Channel on SiriusXM.  Welcome back to Cock Talk. 
[00:51:30]  I'm Mistress Vixen.  Today, we're talking about your first man-on-man experience.  We have Mars on the phone from Puerto Rico.  Mars, talk to me, baby.  I'm a changed man as of yesterday.  I am a fucking changed man.  I'm not the same.  Mmm, Mars, I see here you had your first gay experience last night. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Yummy.  So, tell me, what was that little asshole of yours like before the big night?  My shit is so tight, man.  I guess I'm anal retentive.  It's so tight.  Mmm, sexy.  And what was going through your head when you whipped out that big dick?  He tells me to lie down on my left side, and I'm facing a particular direction, and then  he pulls his apparatus out.  I'm like, hell no, that shit is not going near me.  Sure enough, he goes behind me.  How big was it?  It was, I swear to God, about two feet long. 
[00:52:30]  Ooh, you're a spicy little bitch, aren't you?  And what did he say before he put it in you?  Did he ease it in?  I'm just feeling for a second, and all of a sudden, this motherfucker, all the way in  my ass.  Oh.  Ooh, you lucky little taquito.  Tell me more.  He goes like, he goes like this.  Come on, buddy.  Help me.  Help me here.  Work with me.  Let me do my job.  What was that job?  Open my ass.  I don't know how you guys do it.  Just letting that rainbow-striped freak flag fly. 
[00:53:00]  Come on.  Alcohol.  How do you?  Alcohol.  This all sounds so dirty.  How'd you get cleaned up after?  Sir, did he do it for you?  Yeah, he cleaned it afterwards.  No, he did it afterwards in front of me.  No, he did.  Ooh, how did he do that?  What is it?  Toss salad?  You could toss my salad anytime.  Ooh, he licked your asshole clean with his tongue?  Exactly.  My God, Mars.  You are so naughty.  Any guy would be lucky to go south of the border with you. 
[00:53:30]  This is our secret.  Don't tell anybody.  What I wouldn't give to have a dick sometimes.  Well, tune in next week when Cock Talk returns and we talk to guys about their first time with a down-low brother, Mars.  I bet you have a story like that, don't you?  Ooh, you little Spanish fly.  You've got me all wet.  See you next week for more Cock Talk.  Get up if you want to. 
[00:54:00]  It's Grimm in the morning with Greg and Jim.  Grimm in the morning with Greg and Jim. 
[00:54:30]  Let's do this.  Not sure if you're a boy or a girl  Hey, babe, your hair's all right  Hey, babe, let's stay out tonight 
[00:55:00]  You're like me and I like it all  We like dancing and we look divine  You love bands when they're playing hard  You want more and you want it cost  Get in topical  Hold up, wait a minute  With the sex man  Good morning, sexy  Good morning  I was trying to wait for the hook there, but 
[00:55:30]  It takes a while  It takes a while  I love Bowie  I love old Bowie  Diamond Dogs, right?  Released 38 years ago  What was on Diamond Dogs?  All I knew was Diamond Dogs and Rebel Rebel  That was it  Give me the list  I'll tell you what was on there  I think there was only five songs on that  Was Suffragette City on there?  I don't think so  I don't know  I don't know my David Bowie albums  I do like David Bowie songs though  Space Oddity  Here's what I have  1984  Chant of the Ever-Circling Skeletal Family 
[00:56:00]  Diamond Dogs  Future Legend  And Rebel Rebel  Do you know what's good?  Fuck it  Which one did you say?  What's Ground Control to Major Tom?  Space Oddity  That's a great one  Oh yeah  And also  I like  Did you like China Girl?  Hated  China Girl  What about Modern Love?  Silence of the Lambs  Modern Love I despised  Because me and Florentine  We did a pilot for VH1  Which I watched part of recently  This is fucking 1999 maybe 
[00:56:30]  Wow  We played roommates  Jerry and  What was my  Morris  It was like a Beavis and Butthead  Where it was  Me and Jim were roommates  And we would watch videos  And comment  And then  There was a guy and girl couple  In another apartment  We would all watch videos  In our apartments  And comment on them  And have like little storylines  I watched part of the pilot  Very recently  And it made me laugh  It wasn't that bad huh?  No  Me and Jim had some funny stuff  I think  And this was one of the songs  Could you rework pilots you think? 
[00:57:00]  In this day and age  Probably  But I remember that they would  Write us stuff  And there's a line in this  Where he goes  Say bye bye  And they had me and Jim  Wave at the TV  Bye bye  Which I hated  I don't know man  I don't think  Bowie got caught up  In the whole MTV culture  You know  I don't know if he really  Had to do that  This is a good tune though  I hate to  It's very catchy  But  Yeah  You want some Space Oddity? 
[00:57:30]  I almost feel like  Anyone could have sang this song  You know what I mean?  Yeah  Like Bowie was  Fucking Bowie  Before MTV came around  But a good tempo  Is fucking  Da da da da  It's such a good beat  I'm a sucker  For a good pop song  Yeah  I really am  In the end  La la  I can't help but do that  When I like this song  This isn't a bad song  Yeah  Where's Roland?  I'm supposed to be getting  Some David Bowie t-shirts  Some Rolling Stone t-shirts 
[00:58:00]  I'm supposed to be getting  A Kurt Cobain Nirvana t-shirt  And I was supposed to  Where are my t-shirts?  On Twitter  Which he didn't start up again  Nah he's a little scared  For what?  They showed that  Governor Christie photo  All over TV last night  Thanks for the heads up  On Twitter  A lot of people  Looking out for me  I guess O'Reilly had it  And O'Reilly  Showed the picture  Of Governor Christie  Possibly sleeping  At the Springsteen show  And I'm like  Oh here's O'Reilly  He's gonna have to stick up  For Governor Christie  He gave a look  In a line or two 
[00:58:30]  Like oh really?  You're saying you weren't asleep?  And he almost rolled his eyes  Like it's very obvious  You were asleep  But he  I guess he couldn't go all in  But it was  It was pretty evident to me  That O'Reilly believes  That he might have been  Sleeping at the Springsteen show  I was all hoping  For my Twitter plugs  And  Did you hear Liam  On the after show yesterday?  Why would I?  He's the one  Who's freaking out Roland  Oh really?  He keeps telling Roland  That somebody's gonna  Call him and sue him  And that he's gonna get fired  Sue him for posting a picture? 
[00:59:00]  Do you know how dumb  Governor Christie would look  If he sued  A fucking  A fucking Springsteen fan  For posting a Twitter photo  Yeah  When it looks like he's sleeping?  Yeah  What?  You didn't start your Twitter account  Back up  Nah  I have nothing to tweet anymore  Why wouldn't you?  But that drives me nuts  That people here  Are telling Roland this  And freaking him out  And it's like  Look at this  Go ahead  Play this  This is from GMA  Which is  Good morning America  A little TV show 
[00:59:30]  On ABC  This would be like  Touching the third rail  Of New Jersey politics  The governor however  Is fighting back  And this morning  Ron is on the story  Hey Ron  Alleged is the key word here Dan  And it all began  When someone  A Democrat  Roland  Snapped a photo  Of a red Democrat  Why do they have to  Always do that shit?  Maybe sometimes  Someone goes  Holy fuck  This is a cool photo  I'm gonna take it  Why does it always  Have to be political?  Holy shit  And I'll tell you  It's stupid Roland  He doesn't know  The first thing  About politics  And why don't they  And why don't they 
[01:00:00]  Know who it is?  Why don't they know  Who it is?  Because there's  They know who it is  But they don't want  They're gonna make believe  They don't know who it is  But they don't know  What Rolando means  They don't know the connection  How about you do  A little research  And you would know  That Roland doesn't  Give a fuck about politics  But they all do this  Well they  Yeah but they can't  Do research  Because he took his  Twitter down  Because people at the  Company are panicking  Who's panicking  At the company?  That's what I'm saying  I understand why  Roland's nervous  By the way  Not one discussion  With the marketing  Department here 
[01:00:30]  About this photo  No  Not one  No  Why would there be?  And I snaked my own  Twitter into this whole thing  They're putting  Opi Radio on TV  They're putting  Rolando 99  Rolando  You got all of Fox  Rolando what?  Rolando  Rolando's  99  Rolando's  99  You would think  Sirius XM would actually  Walk down to the studio  And have maybe just a little  Conversation about this  Nope  Why don't they do that?  Because  It's your normie  Whether they like it or not  We don't even have a discussion  About it 
[01:01:00]  But this thing  You know  We're on day two  They're still talking about this  Today  Are they even aware  That we're getting publicity?  Well I brought it up  In our meeting yesterday  That Roland had created  Not only been a part of  But created a news story  And what did they say?  Good job Roland  Oh good job Roland  But you're all over Fox  No but why not tie that in  Like they should encourage you  To keep your Twitter account  And say use it to  Promote the platform  As a goof  Something  Have fun with it  You know what I mean 
[01:01:30]  Like it should be  Something silly  You didn't do anything wrong  Go back  And also I want to  Play the O'Reilly clip  Where you know  Not a big O'Reilly fan  I'll be honest with you  But he did the right thing  With his picture  He didn't politicize  He obviously wasn't sleeping  He basically hinted like  Oh I think you might be sleeping  On the story  Hey Ron  Alleged is the key word here Dan  It all began when someone  A Democrat perhaps  Stacked a photo of the Republican governor  With his eyes closed  At the Springsteen concert  Which would definitely be a no-no 
[01:02:00]  For a New Jersey politician  But now the governor  Is offering his own explanation  He says he was  Grooven to the music  You decide  He is New Jersey's  Biggest rock star  That's good  Show Springsteen from 1985  They have nothing to talk about  He is the state's biggest  And most famously pugnacious  Political star  He's fat  Get the hell off the beach  In Asbury Park  Chris Christie is also  A big fan of the  I'm starting to think  Christie is a tough guy  Yeah  I'm starting to think  He wanted to be in the Sopranos 
[01:02:30]  Yeah  You hear what he said  About the New Jersey Nets  They could buy  He said good riddance  You gotta get that clip too  That's a good clip  To play today  That's pretty funny  Cause the New Jersey Nets  Are officially leaving Jersey  Everyone knows that  But they played their last game  In New Jersey  And next time you see them  At home  It's gonna be in Brooklyn  The Brooklyn Nets  Which I think is really cool  For the franchise  I think it's gonna fucking  Wake that franchise  The fuck up  But Governor Christie  Had to be the tough governor  Saying good riddance  Fucking blowhard 
[01:03:00]  Shut up  Why would he want  Athletes in this fucking state  Right  You're not a Soprano guy  Relax  You're not  Just govern you dope  Lose some weight  Fat fuck  He can't control his weight  But he's gonna tell us  What to do  That's exactly  Oh really  Let the state vote on that  How about the state votes on  If you're a certain weight  They don't have to pay  Your fucking medical bills  Right  You want the voters  To decide on fucking  On who can get married  Right  How about you let  The fucking voters decide  On what weight 
[01:03:30]  The state stops providing  Your government healthcare  Fucking fatso  He wears a hula hoop  As a belt at this point  He is the roundest person  I've ever seen in my life  He's horrendous  I play  Play  The Bruce Springsteen  From  I would guess this is  Roland would know  1982  Roland knows what show this is  This is ABC  Why can't they get their  It's like 80  Well they probably filmed  Like in 85  But a lot of people out there  Would look at ABC  Like as a respectable  News organization 
[01:04:00]  And they don't even have  They don't even have  Their stock footage up to date  They have to show  Springsteen  From like 25 years ago  For a Springsteen  And explain who he is  He is a rocker  From New Jersey  They update you  For Springsteen  Later in the story  All right  A veteran of more than  120 Springsteen concerts  Including this one  In New York City's  Madison Square Garden  Just a few weeks ago  So imagine the  Governor's embarrassment 
[01:04:30]  When a fellow concert goer  Snapped this photo  Of Christy  Apparently snoozing  In mid-concert  Falling asleep  At a Bruce Springsteen concert  Is about the worst thing  That a New Jersey politician  Can possibly do  I think it's worse  Even than insulting  The cast of the Jersey Shore  But Christy  Is not getting the accusations  Lying down  He's fighting back  During Rocky Ground  Which is like  Kind of a really spiritual song  Is it?  People sat  So I sat up on the seat 
[01:05:00]  And I put my head back  And closed my eyes  And listened to the song  The incident  Dubbed Snoozegate  By one website  Was quickly splashed  Across newspaper headlines  From Cape May  To Hoboken  And beyond  Fair or not  Christy now joins  Such alleged  Narcoleptic luminaries  As Vice President  Joe Biden  Who was caught  Resting his eyelids  During a speech  By President Obama  Former Vice President  Dick Cheney  Who seemed to be  Slumbering  During a cabinet meeting  And Pope Benedict  Who once caught  A few winks  During a Sunday mass 
[01:05:30]  On Malta  But somehow  It's especially uncool  To appear to nod off  During a high decibel  Rock concert  This is Bruce Springsteen  After all  Not the opera  I have never  Fallen asleep  During a Bruce Springsteen show  I will never  Fall asleep  During a Bruce Springsteen show  Well  But it only got worse  For Christy  When he started reciting  The names of everyone  Who was with him  At that concert  Apparently  To try to prove  That he was fully  Conscious throughout  The governor said  His wife was not there  It turns out 
[01:06:00]  She was there  Prompting Christy  To say  It was dark  What did I know  I was tired  Oh no  That seems to be  Self-incriminating  Yes  But he also said  Listen  Nobody was taking  My photo  When I was fist pumping  During Badlands  Was he body surfing  Is the big question  I would say  He was sleeping  I would say  He nodded off  A little bit  He just seems  Yes Kenny  Like a douchebag  With this whole thing  Is there any way  To see that picture  To prove or disprove 
[01:06:30]  That he sat up  On the seat  Like he contends  Well he said  He sat up on his seat  And put his head back  But the picture  That made it to  Roland's Twitter  We'll just say  Shows his head  Kind of forward  And that's the position  You would put your head  If you wanted  Like get a quick  Little cat nap in  And you know what  He actually may have  Been relaxing  And enjoying the music  But it's just funny  That he's such  He's one of these guys  He's so annoyed  That he has to explain this  And he wants to make  Everybody believe him  Right  He's going a little too far 
[01:07:00]  You got the  Riley clip  From last night  Although can I say  Somebody raised  A very very smart point  Yes  That he may be  Pushing this story  I believe it was  Our own Danny  Who suggested this to me  Because he may be  Trying to cover up  Something else  That's going to pop up  That he knows  Is coming up  And this is  A pleasant  Annoying distraction  Like this is  Such ridiculous  Non-penalty news  Really  Right  He may be doing this 
[01:07:30]  Because something else  Is coming around the corner  That they won't cover  As vigorous  I don't know  Yeah  There might be a strategy  By him to do this  You got the  Clip of Christy  Talking about the  New Jersey Nets  And good riddance too  We got a bunch of  Christy clips to play today  He  He's one to look at  A little closer  You know  Just how he presents himself  Yeah  He kind of annoys me  Does he  Yeah  His attitude  His tough guy attitude  I don't mind that as much  Just his stance on that one thing  Drives me fucking nuts  The gay thing 
[01:08:00]  Well he wants the people to vote  But why should they  None of that fucking business  That's how he spun it  He goes  No let's let the people  Vote on that  Are you doing that  With every single issue  No of course not  But that's how he got out  Of that controversy  That's exactly what he did  He got out of it  Right  Instead of making a tough call  Look if you're not for it  Then say it  I'm not going to the Nets game  Tonight  And my message to the Nets  Is goodbye  Who's the tough guy  You know  Listen to the tough guy 
[01:08:30]  He loves when people  Laugh at his stuff too  He loves it  If you don't want to stay  We don't want you  I mean seriously  I'm not going to be in the  Business of begging people  To stay here  That's one of the  Most beautiful arenas  In America  That they've had the chance  To play in  It's in one of  The country's  Most vibrant cities  And they want to leave here  And go to Brooklyn  Good riddance  See you later  I mean I don't have any  You know concern about it  And I think there'll be  Some other NBA teams  Who may be looking  To relocate  Who say 
[01:09:00]  You know  They look at that arena  And they look at  The base  The fan base here  In the New Jersey  New York area  And say this is an  Opportunity for us  Perhaps to  You know  Increase our fan base  And to try something  Different  So yeah  I got  There will be no  Tears shed on my part  Tonight  They go  They go  That decision was made  A long time ago  And they want to go  To Brooklyn  Have at it  No problem  From my perspective  Well I mean  You know  It's a tough spot  The New Jersey Nets  Haven't had a fan base 
[01:09:30]  In many many many many years  Absolutely  A lot of times  When the Knicks play the Nets  In New Jersey  There's way more Knicks fans  Plus it's at the IZOD  That's a nice  That's a nice place  It's in Newark  I mean  No no  That's Prudential  IZOD is at the Meadowlands  Oh they play over there  See I don't even know  I just assume  They play  The Devils play at Prudential  No I know that  But they didn't  They didn't move the Nets over there  I don't think so  Did they  Shit on my face 
[01:10:00]  Why wouldn't they move the Nets over there  Now I'm very very confused  Didn't they move the Nets  Help me out somebody  Please  They moved the Nets  From where to where  From the Meadowlands area  To the  Oh I didn't know that  No no no  They're based in the Prudential Center  You're right  Yeah okay  Wait they're in Newark  And he called Newark  One of the most vibrant areas  Yes that's why  Thank you  That's why I brought it up  You're right  Oh  But then fucking Roland 
[01:10:30]  Confused the fuck out of me  I thought they played over there  Why don't you tweet about it  I haven't been to a Nets game  But they've had a tough time  Keeping their fans over the years  Even with the new place to play  They weren't getting fans  So I think they're going to do  Really well in Brooklyn  Brooklyn was made for  Fucking basketball  I mean I think their  I think their  Jersey's going to sell like crazy  Plus a new concert right now  Yeah it's going to be alright  A whole new stadium  Yeah but the most vibrant city  Newark, New Jersey  Let's relax  They're trying really hard 
[01:11:00]  But let's calm the fuck down  Yeah there's a few block radius  It's a real beehive of activity  I do go there for hockey games  And they corral you  To the  You know  The Eyes Out Center  Yeah  They corral you to the Eyes Out Center  There's cops all over the place  No no no  Basically saying  This is the way you walk  To go to the game  That's it  We don't really want you guys  Wandering from  You know  The train station  To the Eyes Out Center  Prudential Center  Period  Prudential Center  Eyes Out Center  Is Roland's confusing thing  Excuse me  Prudential Center 
[01:11:30]  Right  It's amazing the way  They completely block off the streets  Like you're free to roam the streets  Around the arena  Because the cops  Block everything off around there  Jimmy they block  It's perfect  It's literally  They're corralling you  I know  Right to the Prudential Center  Dude I go to MMA events there  Because they're not dumb twats  Like New York City  Yeah  They don't have a fucking union  Right  You're fucking them in the ass  It's not a vibrant city  No  It's a vibrant block  They figured out a couple bars  And restaurants 
[01:12:00]  Right around the Prudential Center  That's okay to do as well  But man  You go two or three blocks  You could be in a world of hurt  Yeah  The cops do  What's it talking about  They do corral you  Yeah  They don't let you  Especially if you're this color  That's right  Literally  We could see  I went there with Jess  For a wrestling show  Like a couple weeks ago  Of course  And you go  What else  And you go to the corner  Right where the cops are  And they let you pass  And you can see  Right across the street  Is where there are a bunch of people  Who you don't want to be  On that corner  Right  And they're waiting  Just waiting 
[01:12:30]  Oh they're just  They're just  Standing there  Yeah just hoping  They're just hoping  They figure  Look  How many people  For a wrestling event  15,000  Yeah they fill up the arena  15,000 let's say  So their odds are like  Alright out of 15,000  We'll get a handful of dummies  Somebody's gonna come from out of town  Somebody's gonna park  A little too far away  Yeah  We'll get a cell phone  Or something  Maybe a wallet or two  Do you think that they look for marks  Oh my god  They have to  Oh yeah  If you were in that business  Why wouldn't you  Just standing on the corner  Just like okay 
[01:13:00]  Police we're fine  We're over here  We're not in your area  I would be three blocks away  Just waiting for an idiot  Waiting to give someone directions  Or something  I think the provincial center's this way  Follow me  Smash them in the head with a rock  And steal everything in their pockets  With a fucking tire iron  No problem  Empty the pockets  But it's  Yeah  That one block  Is completely  It's not vibrant  Is the point  No  They're trying really hard  But it's not vibrant  That's a scary city still  Like you said  There's no way  It's safe to walk 
[01:13:30]  From the train station  To the  To the  Prudential center  Unless there's an event  Because then  You know  Then they  Yeah  They make a parade route  For you  There's a whole crowd  You're safe in a crowd  Yeah  When you all have your  Fucking  New Jersey devil's  Jerseys on  You can't wander around  Looking for a nice spot to eat  No  You can't wander  I mean there's a couple  There's one street  Right next to the  Prudential center  That there's a couple  Little places there  But besides that  I would never go any further  In no fucking way  You can't explore  The local culture of Newark  Yeah but now 
[01:14:00]  You know  Governor Christie's gonna  You know  Someone will now  Either get mugged  Or raped  Because he  He announced that  It's a vibrant city  It's vibrant  So people are gonna go  Oh  I didn't realize that  Let's go to Newark  And you know  Check out the sites  I would bet money  That someone's gonna  Get now mugged  Because he said that  There's people  At every corner  Just waiting to help you  Oh I didn't  Growing up  I thought it was  A hell hole  But he's saying  It's vibrant  You know what  Let's go take a look  At this place  They got the arena  It's so vibrant  Right  You got the O'Reilly clip 
[01:14:30]  Yeah I don't think  He posted it  Okay  That sleepy liar  Huh  That sleepy liar  I think he was  Sleeping  No it's good  That you know  At least we're  No one here  Is encouraging Roland  That's good  Not even a conversation  Not even a conversation  With people that I guess  Supposedly are running  The channel  People upstairs  Like not even saying  To him  I understand why Roland's nervous  He's a fucking  He's a grunt  You know what I mean  He's a fucking  He's a foot soldier  He doesn't want to get  Fucking in trouble 
[01:15:00]  But you're not  One of these guys  That's going on  And Roland  You're fine  You should boot that back up  Like us saying  It's one thing  But somebody from the company  Saying it  Don't worry about it  You know why  They will never do it though  They want to keep  Everyone scared around here  Because if  God forbid  Something crazy  Happened somehow  And there was any blowback  And somebody said  Well why wouldn't Roland  Have shut this down  Then Roland would  Would be able to say  Well he told me  It was  So they're just  No I understand what it is  They're not the one who  Yeah  But you know  They should just say 
[01:15:30]  In all likelihood  Nothing's going to happen  Except good  How about a conversation  About it  We're getting a lot of  It was in a lot of papers  And it's already  Good morning America  Fox did something  MSNBC  No I don't know  And instead of having  Roland from Sirius XM  They have blown  A major marketing opportunity  Because I'll tell you one thing  They would have had Roland on  You know how great it would have been  To see Roland on a new show  I would have loved it  Being interviewed  Put him in a stupid suit and tie  Yeah you look sleepy  You'd be phenomenal 
[01:16:00]  When was the last time  You wore a tie Roland  Um 8th grade graduation  That was it right  Yeah he was 20  Yeah  More importantly  Where's my fucking t-shirt  You promised me a week later  Kevin just got back  So he's making those right now  So it'd be like a week  You said a week last week  I know but he just got back  From China  Why was he in China  Uh  Did he win the big dick contest  No he has to go to China  Twice a week  Or twice a month  And then India once a month  You see the smallest dick ever  Bonaduce 
[01:16:30]  No it was on my Twitter  Yesterday  Does he have a small dick  It's a  Don't get yourself in trouble  Again Roland  Roland would just be like  In the middle of  Interviews  Just going  Bruce  Oh I know  This  Bruce  This could be the smallest  Penis ever  Do you know how good  It was on my Twitter yesterday  Look at this  It's a cheap plug for  OP radio I know but  Oh my god  Yeah I um  There was  There was  Something was trending yesterday  I can't take credit 
[01:17:00]  For this picture  And I  I clicked on the trend  And then there was a link  To this picture  Supposedly it's a gym in LA  And the guy was like  I fucking gotta take the picture  Of this  And it's  It's an Asian guy  Of course  And uh  You know  People hate stereotypes  But you're  You're looking  If you go to my Twitter  Probably the small  The smallest penis ever  They talk about this  Where some guys have baby penis  I never believed it  My kid  Who was  Almost two  Has a bigger penis  Than this guy  Whoa  He's kinda got a big one 
[01:17:30]  Nice  My kid's kinda got a big one  Yay  And my kid  At two  Almost two  Has a bigger penis  Than the picture  I tweeted yesterday  How humiliating  I think Bobo's  Is bigger than that  Really  And Bobo's  Got a small one  Bobo's got a tiny  Little baby dick  Yeah it's been a while  Since we've seen his penis  That guy basically  Just has a  A protruding vagina  Surrounded by hair  How awful  I have a tiny pinky  And his penis  Is probably  Half of my  My pinky  Right  Half  Half the 
[01:18:00]  The size of it  Oh it must be all  He probably jerks  All with two fingers  How the fuck  How the fuck  Do you get by with that  How the fuck  Do you get by  How do you date women  With that  What do you do  His chubby pubis  Sticks out further  Than his penis does  Well if he shaved it down  That would be a case  Where it would look  Even sillier  He'd look like a child  Right  Yeah  So  Mine looks fucking  Good when it's shaved  Yeah  Fuck you  Dangling  It just dangles there  That's a terrible penis 
[01:18:30]  Isn't that horrendous  That  That penis was so bad  It was trending on Twitter yesterday  Can people see that  Oh  Huh  There's no visual element  Well thank god we got our Twitter  So  Yeah  It's one of my last tweets  On my timeline  If you want to check it out  There are reports by the way  That Bobo is  Has actually found  A ride to Cleveland  Oh really  He just dummy  Actually Facebooked me  Like I'm gonna get him a ride  I don't  I mean I'm happy if you go  But  I don't care  I don't care if you come to the show  He talks at every show  He's always with  Or he's with somebody who talks 
[01:19:00]  Even if he's not talking  He's with somebody who's yapping  Yeah  I'll say it again  Some of the super fans  Of this radio show  I don't even understand  Why they're fans  I don't get it  Like what does Bobo like  About the show  I don't even know  It's the same thing  As Stalker Patty  But he's obsessed with it  Stalker Patty the same way  If you sat her down  And go  Why do you like this show so much  I don't know  But they're obsessed with it  Yeah  How's Bobo getting to Cleveland  Apparently he's found somebody  Who's driving there  That's gonna give him a ride  Who's Kurt Love  It's his boyfriend 
[01:19:30]  I don't know  Oh you don't know  His boyfriend Kurt Love  Are they coming together  I don't know  I would assume Kurt Love is driving  Maybe there's a riff between them  Maybe they're just fuck buddies  I don't know  But uh  Something's going on there  Yeah  You think Kurt Love likes  That you're telling the world  That he's Bobo's lover  I don't know  It's just what I've heard  You know  It's just things that I've heard  I'm not that deep  In the fan community  But I try to stay abreast  Of what's going on  I hear ya  You know  Hey can I Instagram penises  Now that I'm new to Instagram  I don't think so 
[01:20:00]  Not even if it's tiny like that  I don't think  You can Instagram nudity  And then people got mad at me  They're like  Hey not safe for work  You get that yet  When you tweet something  Not safe for work  If anyone sent me NSFW  I would block them  They were all pissed  But I'm thinking  This penis is so small  How could you get in trouble  For this picture  Man how about you  Don't look at it at work  Exactly  Well I didn't say  It was a peener  I didn't say it was a baby penis  I wanted  I wanted the element 
[01:20:30]  Of surprise with that tweet  Can you get in trouble  For twittering that stuff though  Twittering I don't think  No  Oh I didn't know  I thought they  But some of the picture sites  Will uh  Not allow nudity  Oh is that what it is  It's not twitter  Nope  Twitter you can link to nudity  But like instagram  You can't post nudity  Alright  Well thank god  I didn't do that  But then some of the picture sites  Are already like saying  Nope we don't want  The nude photos over here  I've had some shit  Knocked down  Knocked down  I was wondering why that was 
[01:21:00]  Okay  So  You gotta figure out  Which ones allow it  I guess  I don't care  Instagram has cool filters  But it's  Twitter is better  Instagram is fucking stupid  Well they both can exist together  That's the thing  They compliment each other  And instagram's becoming pretty big  So it's not bad  Not a billion dollars big  That dumb Zuckerberg  Well facebook is the worst  It sucks  Facebook fucking stinks dude  It's shitty  I don't know how to navigate it  I don't know how to separate  My fan page from my regular page  The regular 
[01:21:30]  I hate the way the fan page looks  All these shit all over both pages  The privacy settings  Fucking stink  Facebook fucking blows  Yeah  It's a bunch of computer nerds  Who have become too clever  It's like it's hard to navigate  Sorry  I got a fan page as well  And I can't update it from my phone  Because it'll go to my regular page  I'm like no  I want to update my fan page  There's no way to split that  I'm not on facebook as regular me  I just use facebook for like a fan page  But I can't update it from my damn phone  You can't link anything 
[01:22:00]  Why won't they allow me to  You can't right  No it's their assholes  They won't let you link anything  Your twitter can't be linked to your fan page  Oh I tried that  Is that why it can't  Yeah  Yeah I don't understand  Why do they make that so difficult  Why  Because my thing got filled up  So I had to start a fan page  And I can't link anything to it  That's what  You know what  That's what I  I was struggling with  Trying to get my twitter  Every time I tweeted  I wanted it to go out of my  It's like here's  You shitheads at facebook  I was trying to post more content  To your fucking site  They're idiots  Yeah  Why would they do that 
[01:22:30]  I have no idea  And now they're just  They just keep adding more and more things to it  That make it more difficult to navigate  And longer to load  I can't wait till somebody comes along  And fucking  Cause my space was kind of simple  And facebook  But I hate the  The poke and the pillow fight  And this one  And you know other  And the world  And your friend requests  Did someone sell  Do you want to delete your request  Or do you want to hide  Or do you  Fucking shut up  I think facebook's on its way out  Do you really  I hope so  My space was  When it was simple  It was popular  And then when people got more and more complicated 
[01:23:00]  And they were customizing their pages  And everything took forever to load  And then it went away  And it was spam too  But in the regular  In the regular world man  People love their facebook page  Not as much as they do  They love checking their facebook page  They'll be  I mean  Cause twitter and instagram  But they're weak right  Something could come along  And just  Easily  Can take it over  And you should just be good at like  Like twitter's good at twitter  It doesn't have to be good at everything  And instagram's good at just pictures  You know what I mean  Like they focus  On one thing that they're good at 
[01:23:30]  And it's simple  And it's easy  Can you go to my fan page please  Like on facebook  This is why I fucking hate facebook  It shows old posts  I don't want a fucking old post showing  Is your fan page  OP radio fans on facebook  Yes  It is  Oh okay  It's the only thing I care about  I don't even really care  I try to  I try to keep up with it  But  They make it very very difficult  There's a picture of me and Patrice  On my fan page  Very cool  Um  Jim Norton's Facebook  I'm sorry  Yeah  Now look at  Let me see  Turn it  Like what the fuck 
[01:24:00]  There's the  There's me thanking people  Me trying to post  And on the right  There's people posting  Where is  Oh maybe I can see certain things  That other people can't see  I don't know  It's already complicated  I just don't  I don't know  Because  You'll post something  That'll be on the left side  Which seems to be the good side  Of beyond  And then you post again  And then the other post  Goes to the right side already  It's very confusing  Yeah this many people  Like this  Activity  With a fucking  With a stupid  A little  Calendar thing  Oh it's so awful 
[01:24:30]  Yeah  They gotta figure it out  It's a great Richard Pryor picture  They need someone  That is a little smarter  As far as  Smarter than Zuckerberg  Well Zuckerberg is  Is smart  As far as  You know  Figuring out the initial  The initial  Start up  Of the whole thing  But now I need someone  That you know  Understands a little better  And how people think  They can't just let it be  And by the way  You can't look  And see who  And who likes your fan page  As the admin  You cannot look and see  Tom  Who likes your fan page 
[01:25:00]  Hi Tom  Hi Jimmy  Sit the fuck down man  You can't do that  Yeah  On your Facebook  It stinks  We're talking about Facebook  And how much we hate it  It stinks  It's horrible  It's over  Why do you think it's over?  It's over  I hope you're right bro  It is  My 65 year old  Parents are  Oh yeah  I guess that's the first sign  Right  Yeah  I'm starting to get sick  Of Twitter by the way  Are you?  Yeah  It's a lot of work  And I'm like  What is the purpose?  The purpose is to take down  The government  But you don't need  It's just being funny  Like I love  It's just being funny 
[01:25:30]  I feel like it's  But it seems like  They all have this life cycle  It's like  Alright Twitter was great  Right  Facebook was great  We all got into it  Then it kind of  MySpace  MySpace  Now Facebook is like  Going to be the next MySpace  And now Twitter is like  That's the hot thing  And feels current  And then that'll get old too  And then we'll use holograms  Twitter has a lot  But then again  Facebook may not go anywhere  It may not be as relevant  To certain people  But that's got a fucking  Half a billion followers  Or whatever  Facebook is still solid  They just gotta figure some shit out 
[01:26:00]  Before a competitor comes along  And just knocks them out of the game  It's scary though  How much information of yours  Is on there  Like my wife was at a wedding  And she didn't like how she looked  You know she said  She looked like a baked potato  She was in this weird dress  And she just didn't like  A little bloated maybe  Maybe she had a little too much salt  Right  A little puffy  Whatever it was  She was puffy  If she was puffy okay  So she doesn't put up  Any pictures of it  Because she doesn't want  To be the baked potato  But everybody else at the wedding  Has pictures of her 
[01:26:30]  Right  Popped up all over the place  We're all  Everybody  Every normal person  Is dealing with the paparazzi  Yes  It's the truth  Like everything you do  In your small circle of friends  You're now  And it spreads out  On the internet  It's amazing  Yeah  Rowan I really feel for you buddy  I really do  This is a big scandal  You're involved in  And it's going to get bigger  And don't think  It's because you're being quiet about it  That things are going to  Kind of calm down  This is going  This is like deep throat  Back alleys 
[01:27:00]  Like walking to the parking garage  Scary shit  Is about to happen  I attempted to take some of the heat  And some of the news outlets  Are going with it  And using Opie Radio now  But the fact remains  It's all started with Rowan  I did try to take some of the heat  Hold on  I did try  I tried to take some of the heat  No you didn't  You're not plugging your Twitter  To take heat  Use one more follow  You know I got my  I got my Twitter on the news Rowan  You're welcome  Alright good point  Good point  I'm kind of mad  They're going back to Rowan 
[01:27:30]  You're right  You fucking called me out on that one  And you're absolutely fucking right  It doesn't  Are you nervous  Like going to your car and stuff  I don't drive  You don't drive  Well we think he's fake mafia guy  Christie likes to come across  Like he was part of the Sopranos and shit  But I think  You're right  I think he's a blowhard  In the end  Yeah he's just a loud bully  He's like one of these guys  That he feels like  If he could just light off  Firecrackers  And people would pay attention to him  How do you crap on the Nets  And Springsteen in one week  That's a very good question  You sleep at a Springsteen show 
[01:28:00]  And you're telling the New Jersey Nets  To go fuck themselves  That's great  Don't you realize  A lot of the people  That live in your state  Are going to go across the bridge  To see the Brooklyn Nets  Way to go Governor Christie  Maybe this is why  He stopped building the tunnel  To New York  Because he was afraid  More people were going to leave  Oh no  He says until New York  Pays their fair share  That tunnel will not be built  That was another lie  That's what he said  That was another lie  He was  New Jersey wasn't  We need a lot more tunnels  Going in and out of Manhattan  But this will probably bore  The rest of the country  And for some reason  We just can't figure it out 
[01:28:30]  We just can't figure out  The obvious shit  Everyone's a fucking greedy cunt  For whatever reason  The obvious shit is  We need another tunnel  Maybe a couple more bridges  And they just can't figure out  How to pay for it  Unbelievable  Well I think this is how  You do take him down though  Good job rolling  You put a little picture up of him  Sleeping during Springsteen  He'll be out  I'm telling you  A tunnel in a basketball team  A fucking bad photo  Ruined Mike Dukakis'  Presidential  Oh man  Aspirations  A bad photo 
[01:29:00]  On that tank  Ruined his presidential  Aspirations  And there's another one too  Yeah  It wasn't just Dukakis  Who else has had a bad  That's why JFK  I mean you know  He wound up having a bad video  But  In the morning  When they presented him  With a hat  A cowboy hat  He wouldn't put it on  Because he was  He was worried about  Looking stupid  He didn't want to have  Right  Yeah  He was smart  He understood that game  During Obama  It looked bad  It lasts for years  This is not going away  This is going to be around 
[01:29:30]  For a long time  It'll always pop up  He's not going to get to  Walter Mondale  I don't think so  No  He just said he was  Rolling  Why didn't you make a video  Imagine a fucking  15 second video  Of him snoring  Yeah why  You just cost him  The vice presidency  He wasn't going to get nominated  Wiping the drool  He's on the short list  Yeah and you don't have to get nominated  You just get chosen  Short list long list  I think he's one of three  Yeah  He's been out there  Fucking Rodney's thinking about  Absolutely  Is he  Cost him now  Yeah  It's Rubio  I watch like Sports and Bravo 
[01:30:00]  Never Can All That  It's Christie  You didn't even know who it was  I didn't know  You're just recording a fat guy  Mitch Daniels doesn't want it  I don't think  And who else  I think it's  Personally I think it's going to be Rubio  Because of the Latin vote  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah it's a smart vote  Talking about Facebook  I was reading an article  It's a quick little game  Because we're a bit older  In this studio right  Wee games  The younger generation  Which is even younger  Than our own Sam  So I'm thinking  We're talking 18  Call it 
[01:30:30]  I don't know  Like 25, 26  Yeah  There's eight things  That they don't need  In their lives  That we did  Oh  Would you like to guess  Valtrex  Comic books  Valtrex  And there's a couple of  Huge surprises on this list  Things they don't need  In their life  That we did  That we did  TV  TV's one of them  Whiteout  TV watching is down  Yeah  They don't watch TV  They don't watch TV as much  Roland just said whiteout  You know what  He has anything for a typewriter 
[01:31:00]  Right  They don't even know  What a typewriter is  That's kind of creepy  Even though a keyboard  Is a typewriter  I know another one  A watch  Oh wow  A watch would be a good one  That's right  Because of the cell phone  It's not on the list  It's not on the list  But we'll put it on the list  Rickshaw oil  We'll put that on our list  Ooh  Fuck  Wow  Other things that they don't  TV watching is absolutely number one  VCR  One of them  Yeah  No no  That probably goes with TV watching  Arnold Schwarzenegger 
[01:31:30]  Arnold Schwarzenegger  They don't need him  We really needed him  We did  Still do I think  What else wouldn't they need  Well what else  Is computers replaced  They'll go with computers  They don't need a desktop computer  Oh good one Jimmy  By mistake  We all grew up with that stupid  Well you know  Sam  Yeah  Child of the 80s  We all had a computer  You grew up with  We all had a family computer  That is going away  No desktop computers 
[01:32:00]  Do you know I watched  That's on the list  The first  I saw the first episode of Mad Men list  I've never watched Mad Men  What  Never  And I'll say it was really good  And they were showing the typewriter  And I'm watching as the guy goes home on the train  And there's no instant communication  And I'm like  It just feels so isolating  Yeah  To watch that  To be so  Like you  Oh my god  It's right  You couldn't text  And then I'm like  Hey shithead  The first 20 years of your life  You couldn't text  Or the first 30 years  I didn't text  I was 30  I know 
[01:32:30]  It's crazy  I forget now  In the last 13 years  How my fucking  I cannot function  Without a constant connection  To  Yeah  Or just like standing in the airport  Any place where there's time  To pass  Online anywhere  Everybody just takes out their device  You got your computer in your pocket  Perfect  And you just sit there and burn time  I don't remember  I really don't even remember  And it did happen  That you would just sit there  You had to communicate  I mean we've talked about it on the show  But you know  Friday happy hour  You're gonna meet your friends 
[01:33:00]  Yeah  How'd you do that?  The word just got out  We're gonna be at blah blah place  You had to make a plan  Like a night before  Yeah exactly  And if you were just out there  You didn't get the word  You were just  Fuck  You would like search a few places  And go  Oh cool  You guys are here today  Right  I was just walking by this restaurant  The other day  And it was like  I had this little outdoor thing  And there were like four tables out front  Everybody in those four tables  Was looking down at their device  No one was talking to the other person  Everybody just had their head down 
[01:33:30]  I'm telling you  Evolution  We are moving towards a place  Where we are all going to be  Just on the same mental wavelength  Through computers  We're gonna know each other's thoughts  Yeah  Yeah  There's gonna be no more privacy  And I'm not saying that's bad  Privacy will be seen as a primitive quality  To need privacy  We are all gonna be in the exact same  We're gonna know everything about each other  So none of it will be shocking eventually  You're right  I mean when I was  Even the stuff you do won't be shocking  If everyone knows what you do 
[01:34:00]  No believe me  They'll fucking  They'll look for tranny tendencies  And they'll fucking  They'll weed out  All non-hackers  But I was thinking about that  With Roland putting this picture out  And then like with my wife  With getting her picture out  You know just like a regular person  A celebrity  Like everything's being spread  Yeah  There's gonna be a time  When anything that you say  People are gonna overhear it  Yeah  You know what I mean  And record that  And then they're gonna put sound bites  Of you just fucking around  And saying something  Some joke about  Jews or black people 
[01:34:30]  Or something  Just that you  You'd say with your friends  That has no venom to it  All of  You're right  Like everything  Every big brother thing  About your images  Your thoughts  Your words  Is going to be spread  All over the place  We're not gonna be  And then they're gonna  Police it  And then we're gonna be  In camps  And then the robots  Are gonna eat us  Oh no  Yeah  Well they're gonna police  It will be our downfall  By the way  The robots  I know  The thoughts eventually  Will know  It won't even be what we say  It'll be what you think  They'll come to a place  Where people start to get 
[01:35:00]  Criticized for  Vicious thoughts  How will that  How will they find  My thoughts  That's the next step  In computers  Where they're already  Working on things  Where quadriplegists  Can move computers  With their eyes  We're gonna get to a place  Where you just think  Of something  And it Googles it  For you  That's coming  In our lifetime  Where we can just  Think and operate  Our computers  So eventually  All of our thoughts  None will be secret  We'll still be bored though  We will  Probably  Probably  I'm serious  But it's true  Like the same thing  That we're saying  Like you didn't text 
[01:35:30]  The majority of your life  Whatever we're doing now  Is gonna seem archaic  Verbal communication  Is gonna seem archaic  Why do you think  All aliens  They don't talk  We're going towards  Silent communication  Because literally  What aliens don't talk  No but they always say  That whenever they see aliens  They just silently communicate  Through their fucking  We don't know though  That's just a movie  Who does  However  It does make sense though  Because we're going  Towards that place  Where we all just  Are thinking 
[01:36:00]  You know  You talk to yourself  Once in a while  But verbal communication  Is not  Is eventually gonna be seen  As I think  A fairly primitive  Non-necessary thing  Yeah  We won't get to hear  Roland's voice  We'll do it  I'm sure we'll still do it  But it won't be  Almost like now  We look at running around  A fire and going  What assholes  We look like  What's the difference  Between that and going  Hey you want coffee  They're just separated  By a couple thousand years  It's a good point  We got two on the list  You want to go for all eight  Yeah  Younger generation  Which is younger than 
[01:36:30]  Desktops  Yeah  So like people who are 21 now  Or even younger  College kids right now  They don't need these eight things  Really in their life  Pencils  Less than we did  Pencils  Yes  Radio  Radio  Calculator  Don't say that  Yes  Is radio on the list  I don't know  I don't remember the whole  Oh you don't have the list  I don't remember the whole list  CD player  I don't know  This was a big set up  To disappoint everybody  Just google it  No  Think google 
[01:37:00]  Think it  Just think it  And see what happens  They're working  Number  Well I know that  Cars are on the list  Mmhmm  College kids  Don't feel like  They need to own a car  Like we felt like  We needed to own a car  That's a weird list  That's true though  Well the percentages are down  Obviously a lot of people  Still buying cars  But they don't feel like  They need to as much  No that generation  That generation  Zip cars  Yeah and they just think  It seems like a big  They don't need to wander as much  We needed to wander 
[01:37:30]  Yeah  That's right  That's exactly right  Like the road trip  Like getting out  Just go for a ride  Remember when you were a kid  You would just go for a drive  And now it's just  You're on your little phone  It's on Yahoo News I believe  You're flying all around the world  In your cell phone  Here's what I was going to say too  By the way  With computer technology now  They can take your voice  And they can take your image  And basically make  A forgery  Like not  We can't do it convincingly now  Right  But 25 years from now  Or 30 years from now  With computer graphics  You will be able to make  An entire movie 
[01:38:00]  With an actor  Who didn't utter those words  Right  Look what they do with this  I get a hologram  Of fucking  Tupac  Tupac  Which is created from nothing  Right  Wait 25 years of technology  Oh yeah  So what you say  Almost won't be  Punishable  Because forgeries  Will be so convincing  It'll be very hard to tell  If that's the organic person  Saying it  Or if it's a forgery  Right  So it'll have to go  Into thoughts  And that's where  You end up living forever  Yeah  You'll just have a record online  Of your whole  Of your whole fucking life 
[01:38:30]  I mean  You'll be long gone  But your being  Your presence  Whatever  Will be online  No you'll be alive too  Fucking  Like that Kako video  They've already grown  Human ears  Like from your DNA  And he  Oh this is what he was talking about  How in the fucking  In the bathroom  Of the future  He said  When you take a leak  He said  Everything will be  Computers will be everywhere  And he said  While you pee  It will analyze  Your fucking urine  And see what's wrong 
[01:39:00]  With your health  He goes  When you're doing your  You're brushing your hair  He goes  Because computer chips  Will be almost  With that  Like dirt cheap  Your comb  Will read  What's  Whatever chemical signals  Your hair gives off  Or you'll  You'll breathe on the mirror  And it will do a fucking  Physical analysis  Of your DNA  And know exactly  Hey you need more of this  You need more of that  Nanotechnology  And he was talking about  Cancer detection  How now they can detect it  With like you know  A hundred billion cells  But like when you do that 
[01:39:30]  It'll detect it with  You know a couple of thousand cells  Or five hundred cells  Way before  But you know  What's the real shitty part  We're gonna be the last generation  Of old people  We fell short  We're gonna just miss it  By like  20 years  That is so fucking  It's true  They're gonna look at us  On the street  I wish I lived in the 1800s  At that point  Look at their necks  They're gonna see us  Walking around  They're gonna feel  Way more sorry for us  Than we do  When we see old people  Yeah  They're just gonna be like  Oh remember when that  Used to happen  No they're gonna hate us 
[01:40:00]  More than we hate old people  Will you guys just stop  Reminding us of what  Could have been  Yeah the other  The other era  When we used to  Age and die  I feel like we're gonna  We're gonna fall  Just fucking short  Just short  We're just gonna miss it  Or we're gonna be cursed  Where they do figure out  But we'll be 85 year olds  Right  While everyone else is youthful  For their entire existence  Now dude  Wrinkle bags  No because the next generations  Will have other things  That we don't see yet  Like they'll have computer  Like computer viruses 
[01:40:30]  Will eventually injure people  Because once we're told  Everything you do  Is on a computer  A virus  Will wipe out your memory  Weird computer shit  That we don't see coming  Is gonna be a fucking  Major problem to deal with  Well yeah  Cause they say like  When you were talking about  Like on the hairbrush  Those tiny tiny  Computer chips  What's that  They say that  That's gonna be  That nanotechnology  Also is  They're afraid  It's gonna turn into  This goo  This self-replicating goo  That's just gonna grow  And like a disease  Right  And physically devour things 
[01:41:00]  Oh yeah  We'll fuck it up somehow  Yeah  I'm trying to remember  The rest of this list now  Fuck  Oh  Another one was a house phone  House phone  We grew up with house phones  Yeah  They're like  We don't need a fucking house phone  That's stupid  It is stupid  TV guide magazine  Good one  You got the other four  A mug with a picture of Benson on it  No one needs that  Did you say newspapers?  Newspapers  Right  Newspapers  Oh newspapers  College kids  College kids just don't feel the need  They don't need to actually read a newspaper 
[01:41:30]  Flavored panties  Yum yum  Right  A video store  Yeah you know what  They don't exist anymore  As much as Roland should be killed  Bookstores  All that  But these were more like  Over the top shit  Oh  Also on the list was  Beer  Beer  Regular beer  Really?  You realize that most  They said most college kids  Have never had a regular beer  They just  They just fucking live their  Lives having light beer  Really?  I thought that was a little weird  That is weird  They don't drink regular beer 
[01:42:00]  Because it's too fattening?  I think it's because  All the advertising  It's like every  Yeah they don't know any better  Bud light  Horse light  They all just go  Light beer  Schlitz light  Huge  Pabst light  What were the other two?  Parents  I don't have the article  I'm just trying to think  Parents  Family  They don't need  Shit  Fuck  I don't have the other two  God damn it  Asshole measuring devices  Lists  Shit  What was the other two now?  Anyone else read this fucking list?  I read it but 
[01:42:30]  Cameras  Camera  No  Oh  No  Video recorders  What did we say so far?  We got TV  Yeah  Watching  TV watching  Home computers  Meaning the desktop  They don't drive as much  Or they don't feel like  They need to own a car  That's so weird  House phone  Newspaper  And light beer  There were two more on this list  I thought  I usually hate lists  But this one  I kind of liked 
[01:43:00]  What else would be in there?  I should have fucking saved the article  Porn magazines  And I did not save the article  Boyfriends  Girlfriends  You can't like  It's not in the Yahoo archives  Yahoo  I mean I don't know what it would be  I'm trying to search out Yahoo  But I don't know what it would be called  In the archives  Alright whatever  Maybe they don't need  Pets  Because they have their robotic pets  Furbies  What's wrong with the Furbies?  You don't need  Human touch 
[01:43:30]  Because you have  Computers  Love  I don't need love  Which is this thing you speak of  Love  Well we'll break then  Fuck it  Eventually you may be  You know what  You may be right Tom  That love  Yeah  Is a fucking chemical thing  And it may not be necessary  After a certain point  Because  Like being funny  May not be necessary  All these weird little things  That release dopamine  In the brain  Once  Once you get these things 
[01:44:00]  Instantly  And whenever you want them  Being funny  Being  All these things  May just be qualities  Like  Like being a good fucking  Antelope sniffer  Like  No one gives a fuck  If you're a good  Antelope sniffer now  But 10,000 years ago  The guy who sniffed the antelope  Got all the blowjobs  I'd like to go the other way  With that  Maybe a bar  Filled with broads  That you're connected  With chemically  Right  Imagine that  Imagine how much fun  That would be  It's like a specific bar 
[01:44:30]  For your  Yeah when you're dating  And you're like  And then every once in a while  You hit on one  You're like  Oh fuck man  You're like  I'm going connection  Imagine having a whole bar  Of women that  They already figured out  Ahead of time  Your chemistry is right  Yeah your pheromones  How cool would that be  That would be pretty great  You'd be out of your fucking mind  And they would be out of their fucking mind  Because they're connected to you as well  Oh the example  Dum Dum Kaku gave  Was that  You'll have  Your wallpaper  Will all be online  And computerized  And it'll be like screens  If you want it to be  Yeah  They said you're single 
[01:45:00]  This is an example  Of our social lives  You'll be single  And you want to go out  On a Friday  And you'll open up  The whole wall  Will be your computer screen  And then you'll just be able  To communicate  Immediately  Like we do on FaceTime  Who's movie  Minority Report  That Minority Report  You just come in  And you start  Moving your arms around  And screens  Like it pops up  I don't know how that'll work  But I can't wait for that  I can't either  That we'll see  I hope we can live long enough  We've got  We really should get  Some human growth hormone  So we can hang out  They're already 
[01:45:30]  They're working on a liver  In five years  They're going to grow livers  Legs and all that stuff  Probably within X amount of years  Eventually your body  Will just be replaceable  Jimmy's hoping  I'm with Papa  Not to live longer  Just so he has a better body  I think we'd fall short  Unfortunately  We're going to fall short  Oh we are  Oh well  I know  We're going to just miss it  How about a TV  That's the size of your wall at home  What are they waiting for  Yeah  Demand  Is that all it is  It's too much money  But on something like that  It'll happen  But Kurzweil said  40 something years  I think he said  His theory 
[01:46:00]  I think he's off  I think he's wishfully thinking  Yeah  But I think he's just obsessed  With being immortal  But Ray Kurzweil said  I think in 40 years  We'll have singularity  As he calls it  Does he think he's going to be around  Because he's like 60 something  No  Now he already has all sorts of  Fucking help  He takes a lot of vitamins  And shit  He does  A lot of stuff  He's in his 50s I think  He did a documentary  It was  Yeah  It was a snooze fest  Because he's a bore  Yeah  But he's a really  They say  Absolute genius  They say he's one of the smartest guys  In the entire world  Oh he's brilliant  I've been reading him for years 
[01:46:30]  Yeah his theory  Did you see the documentary  No  And there are people working on  The robot technology  And these people  Are scared shitless  Because they know  The potential of robots  And they're like  We feel like we should  Just shut down these programs  Because we can't handle  What these robots  Are capable of doing  No  Oh yeah man  They talk to these weird  Far out people  That are all about  The robot technology  Well  If there's a clip online  It would be great to play today  They're like  I'm telling you  Really  I don't know if we want to go down this road 
[01:47:00]  No that's terrible news  Because I really  Embrace the robot future  No they're going to do it  No matter what  But the people that are really  On top of that whole thing  Really  They're a little fucking nervous man  Well maybe we're just evolutionary  Maybe the evolutionary trail  Starts with amoebas  And starts with all that shit  And maybe we were necessary  To bring the robot technology  Into existence  And then maybe our usefulness  Will cease  Maybe eventually we'll fade out 
[01:47:30]  And we won't be needed anymore  I mean we think we're  The center of everything  But maybe we were just  Step five  In a nine step  Or twelve step process  Wow  If you think of the universe  Of course that's what  It's all about  We always think we're  The center of everything  But no we're not  In the end  Wow that is deep  You're right Jimmy  But what about the soul  Fuck the soul  We're not just amoebas  We have a soul  Yeah what is it exactly  It's a fucking chemical thing  No it's a magical spirit  Oh no Tom  I disagree  Oh robot schmobot 
[01:48:00]  What do I know  When I see you  It's not just chemicals  It's my soul soaring  It's spinning with yours  Yes  I tell you  That is pretty interesting though  Devil's Advocate  Had an amazing line  When he's going  What about love  And he goes  Like large quantities  Of chocolate  That was such a great line  Right  But it really is  All it is  It's a dumb chemical reaction  It's meaningless  Like I mean as far as  It serves a purpose  But eventually it won't  Alright for the OCD 
[01:48:30]  People out there  That need the entire list  And we do have people out there  This shit drives them nuts  If you have a whole list  It drives them fucking nuts  You can count on it  I want to thank  CharlesCTX on Twitter  Cigarettes was one of them  Ah really  Finally the youth of America  Has realized  What the fuck  Are we doing by smoking  So that's way the fuck down  So no cars  And no smoking  I just invested in lucky  I know  Nerds  It's just that  The numbers are way down  You know  People are still obviously  Doing both those things 
[01:49:00]  What are they doing  To buy cars and stuff  Because there's no place  To smoke anymore  It's not cool  Yeah  It's very hard  When I was young  It was really cool  For a bunch of tough guys  To go hey  Want to have a ciggy  Yeah at the sock hop  Let's have a ciggy  And loco man 075  To round out the list  It was email  Oh  An actual email account  They feel like  That's just primitive  Really  Yeah because it's more about  You know the Facebook  And the you know  Maybe a little private message  On the Facebook  Or the Twitter  And all that  Wait until they get a job 
[01:49:30]  Yeah I know  Once you have a job  You need an email  That one I found weird  Because I still need my email  Yeah  Supposedly you know  Especially like that college  That college age  They think email is stupid  Wow  You don't email  Yeah you know  My daughter has  She took my old iPhone  So she  There's no service on it  It's just like an iPod touch  She's 10  So I don't want to give her  On you know  An account  And have her be able to email  And do all this stuff  It doesn't matter  Because  She 
[01:50:00]  Her and her friends  They just find games  They go on like  Words with friends  Or other games  And they text through the games  Yeah  All they need is a wifi connection  They're like little rats  They just find a way  Through the wall  Or like people set up  Like kids set up  Private Twitter accounts  Sure  And they're only friends  With their friends  So there's like 5 or 6 of them  Yeah  And they just sit there  Tweeting to each other all day  Yeah  You think you're smart  Until you have a kid  Sam saw it over the weekend  We were hanging out a little bit  My son is not even 2 yet  He's about  Almost  Less than  Less than a month away from 2  He knows how to take my phone 
[01:50:30]  Unlock it  And find  Because this is what's important to him  Find pictures  He knows my gallery  He goes to the gallery  And then it's not good enough  To look at pictures  And he does this  With his finger  Oh man  The swipe  The swipe  To find videos  He likes watching my videos  On my phone  And I go watch Sam  If you think I'm  This is a set up  Here it is  My phone is locked  I hand it over to him  And within 30 seconds  He's watching videos on my phone 
[01:51:00]  He's not even 2  Oh my god  That's fucking scary to me  It is scary  This little kid  Is sitting there  And not only  He swipes through  And he's not a genius by the way  Because I'm not bragging about my kid  This is what kids are doing nowadays  No exactly  But he's at the age  Where he can learn language  Where they're really like  What's the word  Malleable at that age  And so now  This is just a new way  It's just a new thing  For them to learn  I tell my cleaning lady  To speak Spanish  The entire time  She's in my house  But he's going to learn  That dirty shit  That dirty Spanish  That's fine  With her rump hanging out  With her crack showing  As she bends down  Warshes my floor 
[01:51:30]  She's in my place today  I'll go over there  And see her butt crack  Her ponytail ends up  In her butt crack  Yeah and I want to get in there  Just give it a little  Yeah of course  Ponytail in the butt crack  But he's on the photos  I like that she's alright  But whatever  And then like  He knocks the hard button  On the phone by mistake  That brings it back  To the you know  Whatever the home screen  Yeah  And he starts scrolling  Through all the pages  Finds the photo icon  Pushes it  And starts scrolling  Through photos again  And finds the videos  I could do that  He's one and a half  No he's almost two now  But he's been doing 
[01:52:00]  Honestly he has been  Doing that for a few months now  Oh my god  Yeah it's creepy as all  Hell  It was creepy to see  Cause I'm thinking  Alright what is he gonna know  At three four five  When does he  He passed me  In intelligence  As far as  Yeah  Oh yeah  Wait you should've  Went diddy  Think about the amount  Of porn that they have  In their pockets  With these devices  They have the whole world  Of porn  But remember when  We were growing up  And you look at your parents  And laugh at them  Cause you knew more  Yeah  As far as technology goes 
[01:52:30]  Oh please  That's gonna happen to us  You got kids  It's already happening  It's happening to you  It's already happening  My daughter watches me  Do anything  With a computer  A phone  Any technology  And she just sighs  And rolls her eyes  Like get out of here  Old man  Just hand it over  I'll do this for you  I could do this  So much faster than you  You dying old bad  I knew I was in trouble  I got a nephew  He's in medical school  He is pretty fucking  Smart this kid  But he was making  His own computers  At 15 years old 
[01:53:00]  And I was thinking  To myself  Holy fuck  And he was doing it  Like it was no big deal  He's like hey  I'll make you one  He did  And he ended up  Making me a computer  He goes oh  I can make a computer  Way better than anything  You can buy at the time  Oh my god  He was 15 at the time  Now he's I think  24, 25  What is he doing now?  He's in medical school  Really?  Down in Atlanta  Oh I needed some circuit boards  Then I will manufacture  A computer for you  He's at Emory  He's fucking  He's a rock star down there  Really?  Yeah he really is  Effortless 
[01:53:30]  Effortless  Doesn't even fucking  Study nothing  It just comes so easy  To this kid  I was like that  Why didn't I get  That part of my brain  Where did that part  Of my brain go?  Right  Why is mine all hard?  Why do I have to  Work hard at everything?  Why is my brain  Like a Triscuit?  He was a huge Tebow fan  And still is  And when you know  They were winning  The national titles  And stuff  He went to  Tebow school there  He was following  The football team  Around the country  When he was in pre-med  And he would call me  Like oh I'm in Vegas 
[01:54:00]  Oh yeah I got  I got a big exam  You know tomorrow  But I'll be back in time  Maybe cram an hour  Before I have to take it  Oh my god  He was one of those guys  You're so old  I had a fucking  And dumb  I had to cram for the  I had to study my balls off  For the easiest subjects  Out there  Right exactly  To get a C  Yeah  Just like a fucking pass  I know  I hate people  Where it comes effortless  There's always gonna be dummies though  Always  Like you know  That was something  That will never change  Oh no actually it will  They'll genetically weed it out  Right  They'll exterminate them  Exactly  Well no  Those are we weren't 
[01:54:30]  So now everyone has  DNA engineering  Everyone has a kid's story  Yeah yeah  I'm not trying to say  My kid is any more special  Than other kids out there  They're all doing this stuff  It's crazy  Yeah it's scary  And the old thing used to be  That you'd have like  One computer for the family  So you could watch  What your kids are doing  On the internet  But then now  You know  Every kid needs a phone  Or an iPod touch  Or whatever  And they have  The same power  That a computer does  I thought about that  The other night  It's like we have this rule  Like if you're on the computer  We want to know  What you're doing  And you gotta ask permission 
[01:55:00]  Yeah  And they're like  Hey I just realized  They haven't touched  The computer in months  Because they have this iPod touch  They're in their bed  Looking at god knows what  Yeah  There's no controlling it  The other thing my kid does  I have my old phone  Laying around  I just haven't thrown it away yet  That's his phone  He walks around the apartment  With it to his ear  Like he's having conversations  I like when they imitate you  Yeah  Like how you would talk  Oh yeah  But I'm  You know  It's the big parent debate  My kid  Will have a phone  By three  Really 
[01:55:30]  Fuck yeah  Just freedom  Let him go  Not even freedom  Just so I know  Where the fuck he is  Even if he's ten feet away  From me  Oh really  I'll be able to get a hold of him  Always answer  Because my brother's like  I'm not getting my kid's phones  He finally gave in  I'm like fuck that  The younger the better  So I can fucking  You know  How old did your brother give in at  Well his kids are older  They're all like early teens  And stuff now  And like 11 year olds  And stuff  Was that like late  For a kid to have a phone now  Oh yeah man  11  Your kid have a phone  Mine's ten  No no phone 
[01:56:00]  A couple other friends have it  But a majority don't  What's the logic there  It's just it's too early  It's be a kid  Grow up  Develop  Read  Do all this other stuff  Become a person  And then we'll get into  Become a slave  I swear I did this last night  They both have  My six year old  And my ten year old  Have our old iPhones  So it's like an iPod touch  I took  I just got back from the road  I hid them  I hid them yesterday  And they came home from school  And just  They just started  Looking around  And I could see it 
[01:56:30]  They weren't saying anything yet  They're just looking at me  Like um  And all night long  Where's my phone  Where's my phone  I said it's in a safe place  I just  I need to check my messages  I'm like no you don't  You have nothing going on  But you know  It's  But that's what it's gonna be  So when you say  You know  You want them to read  And stuff  You're gonna  You're actually doing them  A disservice  No I don't think so  I think you might be  I don't think so  Because all the other kids  Are on their phones  That's what is important  But they're just  Dicking around  They're like 
[01:57:00]  They're gonna walk  Into school  With all that  Stupid book knowledge  And their fellow students  Are gonna look at them  Like you idiot  Who cares  Yeah it's like  You don't need it  But I really  Do you realize  What apps I got  On my phone  But you don't  Really read  On these devices  You think you're reading  But you don't  No  You don't get  Like I get the  New York Times  On my iPad  Oh  Fancy  Mail  Yeah  Someone's got a case  Of big shot-itis  Someone wants to brag  About their  Intelligence 
[01:57:30]  Do you get through  The Sunday  New York Times  Forget it  Okay good  Forget it  I work out with it  It's all heavy  I left it  Over your head  Yeah there's no way  I don't know  I really think  That you  The little brains  Should develop  Before they become  Slaves to it all  True  You know  Yeah  I mean they're  Doing it anyway  My little rules  Are just one little  Stop  You know gap  For them  They're getting around  How long did it  Last before you said  Oh fuck this  Here's your stupid 
[01:58:00]  I didn't give it  Oh good for you  They just got kind of  Quiet and they were  Just kind of  Well tomorrow  Will I have it tomorrow  Right  I said yeah  I just  So what are they doing  They just  They didn't do anything  Plotting his death  They're setting up  Tripwires around the house  They're probably on mine  You know as soon as  You left the room  They know exactly  Where the phones are  They've probably  Been on the phones  Exactly  They probably put  A tracking system  In that phone  When you were  Away on the road  Who are you kidding  They know exactly  Where those phones are 
[01:58:30]  The one kid took  Her iPod shuffle  The little square one  You know  And started going  Through that  And I could see  She was trying  To find a way  How can I use this  To do what I want to do  She was going through  Her photos  And all of a sudden  She couldn't crack it  You know what  She'll probably open  The back of that  And rewire  The whole fucking thing  I know  The robots are coming  That's really interesting  Though that we're  Going to be  You gotta find the robots  We're just the amoebas  We are just a 
[01:59:00]  One thing in the evolution  We're not  We aren't the plan  We're just a little part  Of it  Possibly yeah  I think you might  Be honest on with that  It's pretty frightening  Oh yeah  Alright well  I got  I got family members  That are proud  Yeah my  My nephew is working  On stem cell research  Wow  This kid is  Could be something  Fucking huge  Geez Louise  He was  I've told  I've talked about  My nephew Jason  A bunch of times  On the show  He was a kid  When he was growing up  He never 
[01:59:30]  Showed my sister  His grades  He said  Don't worry about it  And they never  Checked on his homework  He said  Don't worry about it  He controlled the house  When he was a little kid  I don't know how  You get this done  At what age?  You know  They lived in Florida  So unfortunately  I didn't grow up  With my  You know  I would see him  A couple times a year or so  But he  At an early age  He was like  I got this  You have nothing  To worry about  And he would  He would just go  In his room  Close the door  When it was time  To do his shit 
[02:00:00]  Wow  And then at the end  Of every semester  He would just throw  His A's down on the table  Boom  There you go  Those are the  Those are the real  And they never  And after a while  They just never  Questioned this kid  He was an adult  By an extremely early age  I remember  When I used to go  To Florida a lot  And see my sister  I remember him being  Like maybe five  In the back seat  Still in a car seat  Right?  Yeah  And I drove him  To a theme park  It might have been  SeaWorld or something  And I got lost  On the highway  Trying to get back  To my sister's house  I thought I had it  And he fucking 
[02:00:30]  Told me how to get home  At five  And I thought  That was amazing  Maybe five year olds  Just know that shit  I don't know  They don't  I didn't know at the time  But maybe I should have  Fucking realized  At that point  But yeah  He's working on  Stem cell research  And all sorts of shit  Down there  That's the scary  Those are the really  Scary smart people  And the kids  When they  They just do it  For themselves  They're not doing it  To please their parents  They're not doing it  They're just like  Quietly like  No my brain is  I'm working on this  And then he would  Just build a computer  In his room  Like I'm gonna build  My own fucking computer 
[02:01:00]  Were you good in school?  Yeah  I was bored with school  That was my issue  You were just bored  I just knew  I have to  I tweeted yesterday  Stupid Shakespeare's  Birthday right?  Right  Shakespeare was a nightmare  When we were growing up  We had to learn that shit  And I'm like  Why did we have to  Learn that shit?  But I remember  Being in school  Going why do I  Have to learn this shit?  What does this mean?  It's a soul  But there were so many  Subjects like that  When we were growing up 
[02:01:30]  Yeah  It was just busy work  You weren't learning  The important stuff  I hated Shakespeare  Trying to translate  That shit  Whyeth don't you  Loveth me  Yeah  Oh it's all Greek  To me Tom  I said to heck  Get a comic book  Live a little  But that Shakespeare  Was interwoven  Throughout our schooling  It would just come up  Here and there  It wasn't even  A Shakespeare class  All of a sudden  Next thing you know  We're reading a Shakespeare play 
[02:02:00]  I'm like why?  Oh fuck  Here he comes again  And then we had to  Interpret it  And then the teacher  Didn't even know  Because he wasn't sure  Because there's many  Interpretations  Of what he actually  Meant with this  He was like a weirdo  He didn't want to see  It kept popping up  In the halls  Oh shit  Here comes Shakespeare again  I fucking hated that  You going to the game?  Shakespeare's coming  Oh god  Put everyone on Twitter  Oh happy birthday  To Shakespeare  He also died  On the same fucking day  By the way  He did?  Yes  Born and dead  On the same day  On the same day 
[02:02:30]  Yeah a few years ago  Boy talk about  A birthday treat  From Mercury's heart  And that turns out  My molten loins  Oh so you know Shakespeare  I'm just making it up  Oh  I don't know  That's what you have to do  To start putting some weird shit together  And throw some Greek into it  And then in the end  It turns out that  He might not have even  Wrote those plays  Oh really?  That they just used his fucking name  Well  And there were other writers  And said yeah  Say Shakespeare wrote this  So they don't even know  If he wrote his own shit  Or a lot of his shit 
[02:03:00]  Deceit is Mercury's  Unborn child  Shakespeare  Shakespeare  Yeah  That was from  The Merchant of Venice  Oh wow  Yeah  Could you take us to a break  With some Shakespeare  Because I gotta eat and pee  And do all sorts of shit  By the way  Penn Jillette is gonna be in studio  Tom Papa is in studio  Before you take us to break  What are you promoting Tom?

[02:16:30]  E-Roc looking for the  Club Soda Kenny song  Oh  Penn Jillette should be here soon  He tweeted that  Looking for it  Like he's in a vault  Going through files  He's kneeling  He's kneeling  Like a fucking  Looking for it on the floor  CDs  It's like a pile of CDs  Put it in the computer  In college  And we haven't had Tom  Here in a while  We almost lost E-Roc  Over the weekend  What happened?  He was in the emergency room  What?  He's doing much better now  What happened?  I don't know if he wants 
[02:17:00]  To go through it again Tom  It was very very  You want to see the picture?  It's a little gory  You want to see the picture?  Alright  He actually got really hurt  He got really really hurt  I don't know if he wants  To go through the whole thing again  It was  Really?  It was touch and go there  For a while  Were you concerned?  Sure  If you read his Twitter  Of course  We didn't know what the fuck  Was going on for a while man  It was really  Really a scary fucking weekend  Really?  Yeah  Yeah  You got the picture?  It doesn't look like it  Here comes the picture 
[02:17:30]  Did you delete the pictures?  What the  E-Roc  Did you delete the pictures?  It was too emotional for you?  What is that?  Rosacea?  Did someone fall asleep  On a pillow?  You know what Tom  It ruined the bit  But what the fuck  Yeah  Might as well have been  Rosacea  I think he deleted  The other pictures  He went to the emergency room  With what amounted to  A scratch on the side of his head 
[02:18:00]  Why did he go to the emergency room?  That's what we're trying to figure out  But then he gets really mad  If we bring it up  Because he had panic alone  In his place  Like  I've got it  I've got it  Shelving fell down on him  In a garage  In a nail  Scraped the side of his head  I think it was like  One of those  Little tack nails  I don't think it was a nail  And his jaw was a little sore  So he wasn't sure  If he broke his jaw  So he went in  And got checked out  How about a mirror?  And I don't know  And then he like  Was mysteriously tweeting about it 
[02:18:30]  So we didn't know  If he had a fucking  Diabetic coma thing  Or a fucking heart attack  We didn't know  What the hell was going on  With this kid  And he walks in fine  He walked in fine Monday  Some people want attention  He was hoping  It might be a little more  So he'd get a little more attention  It backfired on him  Did he lose followers?  He might have lost followers  On that  Yeah  It really looks like  He just fell asleep  On a  Like a hard pillow  Well he squinted his eye  In the picture  To make it look worse  Is he wearing like 
[02:19:00]  A hospital robe?  Yes  Oh god  In the end  It was not even contusions  It wasn't even contusions  No blood loss  He said it was  It was a bad bruise  There's no bruising  And the doctor gave him  Like a low level of Percocet  Oh that's  That's a long way to go  There you go  There's the Monday morning picture  It's the same as  Friday morning  Don't be  Confused by the swollen neck 
[02:19:30]  It's always like that  That grapefruit sized tumor  Is his face  That could confuse you  That could confuse you  But trust us  It's always like that  It's more about  What's going on  Around the ear  I guess  We don't know  We don't know  What the problem is  Look how lonely  That ear is  On that massive head  That ear  On that profile  It's like  It just wants  A normal sized face  It would take a long time  For that ear  To make it to the chin  At this point 
[02:20:00]  That is long distance  From Chinville  Oh my god  Where were we  We can't find the  Club Soda Kenny hit  This is filler  You have it right in front of you  Literally looking  It's on your right  I got it  Gave you the disc  Gave you a disc  So you guys made this  A hit on the after show  Kenny singing this  Hit song  Yeah we made the song  A hit and then  Club Soda Kenny  Caught the fever  And so he sang it  Okay  So it was like a remix  Kenny remix  It's Club Soda Kenny  Call me maybe  I threw a wish  In a well  Don't ask me  I'll never tell 
[02:20:30]  I looked at you  As it fell  And now you're  In my way  I trade my soul  For a wish  Pennies and dimes  For a kiss  I wasn't looking  For this  But now you're  In my way  Your stare  Was holding  Ripped jeans  Skin was showing  Hot night  Wind was blowing  And where you  Think you're going  Baby  Hey hey  I just met you  And this is crazy  But here's my number  So call me maybe  It's hard to look right 
[02:21:00]  At you baby  But here's my number  So call me maybe  Hey  I just met you  And this is crazy  But here's my number  So call me maybe  And all the other boys  Tried to chase me  But here's my number  So call me maybe  Before you came into my life  I missed you so bad  I missed you so bad  I missed you so so bad 
[02:21:30]  Before you came into my life  I missed you so bad  And you should know that  I missed you so so bad  Here's where they want me  To ad lib  Good for them  Pull my prick  Pinch my helmet  This has been another  Club Soda Kenny production  With my man  Troy Kwan  And prime time  Sam Roberts  Stay tuned  For behind the music 
[02:22:00]  With Club Soda Kenny  Club Soda Kenny  On Facebook  Y'all  Stop yelling  See I liked  The very end  When Kenny was just riffing  Yeah  And being silly  Yeah  I just typically don't like  Anybody singing  Bits  Yeah  But I hate them  We've done a lot of them  They fucking all stink  I never enjoy them  Even you singing  Oh that was only  In a montage of all of us  But I've never done one on my own 
[02:22:30]  I wouldn't  They're fucking awful  I like when Kenny  Sings the hits  I like when Kenny introduces songs  Because he can talk  Yeah  But just hearing Kenny  Sing in a bad voice  Me in the shower  But hearing Kenny  Introduce songs  Fucking country  Kenny cow shit  Or whatever  That makes me laugh  Here's Jimmy singing  Oh you know what  I guess I have  There we go  One two three four  Tell me that  You love me more  Sleepless  Long nights  That was what 
[02:23:00]  My interest was  I like it  Teenage hopes  Arrive at your door  Left you with nothing  But they want some more  Because the ironic point  That we're all bad singers  We know  I kind of like it  You're changing your heart  That's a good point  There's no point to it  If we were real singers  And one of us sucked  That'd be great  But we all stink  I kind of like it  It's true  Yeah  The whole reaction  To any of those  Is yeah he can't sing  I forgot about that  I did do Beth  Plus it was just another way  For me to play the song  Yeah  Bob Kelly sang 
[02:23:30]  Don't Stop Believin'  On Friday Show  Yeah  On our Facebook page  Opie and Anthony  I kind of like that  Because he really got into it  Yeah the video's up there  That's a cheap plug for me  It's because you don't believe  In a soul Jim  I know  I heard about Bob Kelly singing  I just  It was fun  Because it was karaoke  And we had to make shit up  Can I hear it?  No one was here  Can I hear it?  No it's too long  No it's too long  No it's too long  I was just trying to get people  To our Facebook page  Opie and Anthony  I'm sorry  Like that shit motherfucker  Plus  Now  There are thousands of people  That are going to have  Call me maybe  Stuck in their head all day 
[02:24:00]  No they won't  No way  They absolutely will  No  Because I  I fall prey to that very easily  Trust me  I forgot it already  I've gotten hundreds of tweets  Over the last week or two  Still people saying  Call me maybe  Well tell your mom  To stop tweeting so much  She doesn't tweet  Mom is bleeding  She does  Hey  My brother Scott  Wants in on the E-Rock abuse  This is family wide  We all love  Making fun of E-Rock  Why are we going back to E-Rock?  That's not fair  Because my brother  The whole family  And he's got the Islander poster too  So you think he would be a little nicer 
[02:24:30]  You know about the Islander poster right?  No  It wasn't a poster  E-Rock you want to  No I'm good  No come on  Because Papa doesn't know  I have some catching up  I've been away  Yeah please  Was it a poster?  It wasn't a poster  I thought it was a poster  No  You gave me a nice gift for Christmas  It's a poster  It's not a poster  Why isn't it a poster?  Because it's not a poster  It's a photo  It's a framed photo  Signed by some  Hall of Fame  New York Islanders  And that's his favorite team  Uh huh 
[02:25:00]  So we got him that  And he decided to have his brother  Hang it in his garage  Because it's a little  Like photo  No it's  I don't really  I don't really hang stuff in my apartment  Or is it 8 by 10?  No  It was nice  The frame is maybe  2 feet by 3 feet  It's a little bit  2 feet by 3 feet  It's a little bit  That's almost  Ooh museum glass  It was big  My brother loves it though  Really?  That's the point of the story  My brother loves it  You fucking got museum glass 
[02:25:30]  For that stupid poster  Museum glass  What is museum  Is that better than regular glass?  Much  I actually use it for everything  Why is it better?  Because it prevents the UV rays  From fucking up your picture  You know it's museum glass  Because like  See the lights above our head  If you look into glass  At the reflection  The lights above our head  They're yellowish  But if you look into the glass  And they're a bluish  Tinge  That's museum glass  It does protect signatures  Nice  And I get all my fucking  Autograph stuff  When I frame it  It's with museum glass  I sleep in museum glass 
[02:26:00]  Really?  Yes  I wrap it around my cock  When I have sex  Behold  Well that brother  Who has the Islanders poster  Didn't do your side of the bit  It's not a poster  It's not a poster  He just texted me  He said  And I've seen this picture  And Scott  Please send it  I want to tweet it  He once got a  Very recently actually  He got a fish hook  Entirely through his thumb  And didn't go to the ER  No you don't go to the ER  Unless you're really injured

[02:28:00]  For our Sully interview  What?  I got it  You want me to blow it up  On the air  You want to talk about  On the scene  What's happening  Every time he tries  To discuss the landing  Oh yeah  We cut him off  And talk about everything  But  Yeah  I love it  But purposely  We'll even lead him that way  But every time he gets to like  Well on that day  Well yeah  We'll get to that  That's hilarious  Because we don't want to talk to Sully  I do though 
[02:28:30]  Because  I think that  I'm sure we'll take some calls  I know that  Lyle Chipperson's a fan of his  And we'll call in  Yeah  As will Paul Hargis  But I would be nice to him though  Just because he did save  A bunch of people's lives  Well we noticed Tom  If you're a hero  Yeah  You don't get to write one book  You get to write a lot of books  It just keeps on coming  He's on his second book  And it's a bit of a drop off  In the first one  And that's saying a lot  A bit of a drop off  Still haven't crashed  Like Jimmy pointed out 
[02:29:00]  Perfectly yesterday  He talked about everything  In the first book  He loved nothing  I listened to that bit  We did about the first one  It's funny  To read the YouTube comments  And I forgot that we said  His book was called  Geese are cunts  Right  We really gave him  A good mocking  That was very satisfying  Did you have a man  Or you talked to him  No we just made fun of  It was the first book  We attacked  That's hilarious  I'm sure he's a nice man  Well what happens is  I guess if you're a hero  And you're shopping  You know a book deal  You could go 
[02:29:30]  Well that's nice  But I want a two or three book  Sure  Yeah your agent gets in there  And the problem with that  Is we're stuck with the second book  Which is  What's the book called?  We even forgot  We did this whole thing yesterday  I think  Let me just think I remember  Nobody Gives a Shit  Part 2  I think it's called  Chesley Sullenberger  Blame my agent  I forgot the name of it  Yes  We talked about it yesterday  For the life of me  I wouldn't be able  To come up with it  Really?  Yeah I don't know 
[02:30:00]  It's about inspirational tales  And the big one he lists  Is Tony La Russa  What?  It should be a book  About overmanaging  And only batting lefties  Against righties  Fucking asshole  I hate Tony La Russa  True inspiration  Yeah  It's called  Overmanage a baseball team  Making a Difference  Stories of Vision and Courage  From America's Leaders  I hate the word courage  In a book title  I hate it  I fucking despise it  You blow off all the books  That have courage  In a book title  Unless it's a guy  On a skateboard  In a clan hood  Headed into the Bronx 
[02:30:30]  Then I'm like  I want to read this book  Of courage  What was the most famous  Courage book?  The Red Badge of Courage  The Red Badge of Courage  There you go  I don't mind that as much  That's gotta be number one  I don't mind that as much  What I don't like  Is the descriptive part  Of the title  That says it's a book  Of vision and courage  Tales of courage  Right  Tales of  Overcoming  The odds and obstacles  And courage  Yeah  And fucking stories  Of courage  Fuck you  Fuck courage  Courage stinks  Courage 
[02:31:00]  Courage gets right in the mouth  Yeah  Fuck that courage  Sully  What does he know  About courage  Leaning on a chair  So that book  He just interviewed  Other people  Who were great  Of course he did  Tell me about your courage  And I'll tell you about mine  Well actually I can't tell you  About mine  Because I told it in the first book  Yeah  That I can't really reference here  Let's toast each other's courage  Right  Here's to your courage  It's like in Jaws  Let's drink to your leg  Let's drink to my courage  Fucking blows  It's funny  And the only guys he gets  Is Tony La Russa  Yeah real brave 
[02:31:30]  Real brave  He's right up there  With fucking Pat Tillman  I'm gonna leave my starting pitcher in  His legacy  His legacy  Is a bit tainted  Yeah  Mr. La Russa  He was part of the whole  Steroid thing  He didn't know what was going on  In the clubhouse  Come on  Yeah exactly  Can we read part of that  He was pretty big too  I'm gonna read part of this  A lot of times online  You can read  Not yet  Probably because it doesn't come out  Until May 15th  Oh I'm gonna read part  I hate the fucking  The sweater he's wearing  With his collared shirt  Look that  That's a different Sully 
[02:32:00]  We don't know the casual Sully  That's Sully around the house  Look he's got an elbow  On a fucking chair or something  Shirt sleeves rolled up  You know  That's right  Oh he's the Dr. Phil now  Yeah  It's celebrity Sully  Making a difference  This book  It's Dressed Down Day at Work  But they try too hard  It'll look like they're being dressed down  Yeah exactly  That's that look  Casual Friday  It's Casual Friday that is over  Casual Sully  To speak in terminology  He'd understand  And this book  Is gonna do worse  Than a goose over LaGuardia  This book  Is gonna do 
[02:32:30]  Terribly  You want real courage  Go out on the Today Show  And try and get people  To buy this  Yeah  You want to prove courage  Get through this book  Without fucking falling asleep  I got a real bit  Let's really fucking  Make it hurt  And get some geese in here  To shit on his butt  While he talked to him  Honk  Honk  Just hear  Honk  Honk  So tell us  Honk  Honk  Honk  Honk  I was  We took off  To 10,000 
[02:33:00]  Honk  Honk  So goose killer  Did you even care about  The family you killed  Honk  Honk  Honk  We got an Uncle Paul bit  I think we should break  Because we gotta catch up  On breaks  And wait for the big  Pendulet interview  For the record  Tweets pouring in  about Carly Rae Jepsen  being stuck in people's heads?  No, I don't think so.  Oh, please.  That's two points.  That's your mom panicking.  It's not my mom.  It's all her fake Twitter accounts.  Boring in.  Her name on Twitter is  MilfWHR. 
[02:33:30]  Is Penn here or no?  I haven't been told he's here yet.  But we'll take a break.  By the time we get back,  I'm sure he will be here.  He should be.  He's never late,  although he's late officially now.  It will be magical.  Tom Papa?  Yes, sir.  Denver Comedy Works this weekend.  I have some shit to straighten out.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Do you really?  Uh-oh.  What do you got to do?  With who?  Uh-oh.  What happened?  What'd I miss?  This is going to be a problem.  Have you ever been here for a problem?  Hank. 
[02:34:00]  No.  Someone should bring up that blog.  We should have that ready.  His video blog.  Uh-oh.  What is it?  Fill me in.  Fill me in.  Do I know?  I think we played it.  He thought Jim Norton  was making fun of Comic-Con.  He didn't kill me.  He just said, you know,  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Yeah, get that clip together.  Because you made a Comic-Con thing?  I did a Comic-Con thing for Leno,  but then Chip did a Comic-Con thing.  Didn't realize.  He confused Jim Norton for Chip Chipperson.  Yeah, and he thought that  we were mocking Comic-Con people. 
[02:34:30]  Uh-huh.  Which, first of all,  they're fair game,  but second of all...  You should mock them.  Yes.  Like any other group.  They would even understand that.  No, there's no different than any other group.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to break  and have that bit ready.  Ooh, this is going to be good.  Tom, you want to see a small penis?  This is going to be good.  And then I'll show you a big one.  You want to see a small penis?  I do.  You do?  I have a friend who can't hook up with girls.  He's got everything.  He's got money.  He's got...  Everything's good.  But he just can't close the deal. 
[02:35:00]  And it just seems like...  You're sitting next to him.  He's such a catch.  I'm thinking he must have a small one.  Or he's gay.  Let me see.  I can't take credit for that.  Oh, my God.  That's a gym in L.A. that someone tweeted yesterday.  And it was a trending topic.  The picture's so ridiculous.  It was trending on Twitter.  So I retweeted it, and people were losing their minds over this picture.  That I would go to the emergency room with.  I might have to retweet it, because people are saying they can't find it in my timeline.  That is ungodly small. 
[02:35:30]  Blown away the stereotypes, by the way.  What do you mean?  Well, you can tell the guy's Asian.  You can see the Asian in his face.  He didn't look at the face.  You can see the Asian.  It's true about that.  This peener.  I've heard over the years that there's guys out there that have baby penises.  My kid's penis is bigger than that.  Already.  And he's, like I said, almost two.  Imagine having a baby peener through life.  That would be really...  How would you handle yourself? 
[02:36:00]  You don't.  Take karate?  No, I mean...  You handle yourself with your pinky and ring finger.  But you want to get laid.  How do you get that...  What do you do?  You gotta fucking embrace it.  You gotta embrace it.  Fucking...  Suck this baby dick.  Come on.  Make this fucker grow.  Come on.  Pull it out with your mouth.  You gotta just use it.  I'm not hurting anyone's pussy with this thing.  Just fuck her as hard as you can.  When you're fucking, you probably learn little tricks.  Like how to fucking drive your elbow into her spine. 
[02:36:30]  So she's like, oh!  Just to get deeper.  Yeah, just things that will help get the sounds that a real man would get.  Just the horrible...  Just going through life of finally, like, getting the girl, getting her to finally come back with you,  finally get your clothes off, and then disappointed every time.  There's gotta be a horrible way to go through life.  Yeah, women say size doesn't matter, but I think it matters to a point, right?  Right, you gotta have something.  If you ask these ladies, maybe they don't want a huge donator, but they want something that looks like a penis, right? 
[02:37:00]  Right.  Oh, man, that is sad.  Unbelievable.  That is really, really sad.  I'll retweet that shit for the people out there.  You should.  They deserve it.  Let's take that break.  Make love.  Pendulet next.  What do you want to do during the break, Jimmy?  Just show each other, do a little size comparison.  He's not here, right?  No, I don't want to make him wait.  Okay.  But we got a Uncle Paul bit to break for everybody.  Cool.  Uncle Paul!  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare. 
[02:37:30]  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love ya.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul recalls his favorite Jordache commercial.  Yay!  That was Timothy and Amber.  She would always jump up.  I'd say, you got the look.  And she'd go, I want to know better.  And I'd say, you got the look. 
[02:38:00]  And she'd say something.  And I'd put her face in the pillow.  Yeah, we'd all dance Jordache.  And I'd slide him down.  Sure.  I'd say, let me smell that word.  Yeah, I could always tell when she'd been running around.  Cause her little feet would smell.  And sometimes Jordache in that little middle scene keeps the smell of the private scent.  Yeah, the jeans would just keep that in there.  Scrub-a-dub-dub.  Somebody's becoming a woman. 
[02:38:30]  They're so young, their bodies are confused.  The body don't know what it's doing.  I bet she was jogging around the playground.  You fall off the jungle, Jim?  I smell a little copper.  My dad says when we're in my room, we have to keep the door open.  Jordache Basics.  I'm not going to do anything different if the door's not open.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  And now he's coming over here. 
[02:39:00]  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  God, why did we invite Penn Jillette in during the break? 
[02:39:30]  Because we didn't know he was here.  The text came through after.  But I mean, you should have sat outside the studio.  I love that you say as you go on,  now we've got to talk about everything we talked about.  Yeah, and then we've got to be actors now.  Maybe we're here for the first time.  Well, let's talk about different stuff.  But Penn Jillette just gave us ten great minutes.  I know.  I do want to talk about the last story we were talking about from your book.  Sure, yeah.  The Hasidic Jew guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Who decided, I can't do this anymore.  And he chose you to show him the light.  Yeah, he's an Orthodox Jew. 
[02:40:00]  And he had been following that his whole life.  And a very serious, I mean, a scholar and stuff had studied that.  And then listening to my radio show, and now Penn Sunday School,  he began questioning more and more things and became a full-out atheist.  And in that kind of strong community, that changes your whole life.  I mean, it did lead to divorce.  It's arguments over where his children go to school.  You know, they go to Hebrew school and so on. 
[02:40:30]  And he came out.  It's so humbling.  You know, after the show, you know, we always hang out and talk to everybody after the show.  So there's big crowds around us.  And then after the show, there's a few people that wait behind because they want to talk a little longer.  And if you're lucky, those are good-looking women that say, I want you to sign my breasts.  And you go, okay, but I'm going to use my middle name, too.  And you need to have my Social Security number.  And maybe I'll draw a little picture of my children when I get to the underneath part where it has the good heft.  And I'm not going to use a pen. 
[02:41:00]  And it should be done in saliva.  It'll be very, very nice.  And, you know, the perfect breast is, a lot of people don't know this,  but it's 55% below the nipple and 45% above.  And that's the problem with implants.  A lot of times they put too much above.  You want that 45 underneath right where it says Gillette.  The famous teardrop.  Exactly.  Of course.  Of course.  What's an example of a perfect breast?  Who's got a perfect?  I've got two of them.  But mine are B-cups. 
[02:41:30]  They're not really big enough.  Who's got a big perfect tit?  Oh, God.  Seika did.  Seika.  Seika.  Seika.  Had perfect teardrop tits.  She just sent me her autobiography.  Yeah, I've read it.  It's great.  Is it good?  Yeah, it's really good.  She follows us on Twitter, too.  Yeah, she's great.  I love Seika.  She seems to be a fan of the show.  I don't know.  And I liked her because no matter what she was doing in porno and how nude she was, she  always had a little scarf on.  Yeah.  There was always that little accent.  A little class.  A little class.  She was like Batman.  She believed the accessories really mattered. 
[02:42:00]  She had her little, you know, fuck scarf.  And he had his utility belt.  I don't know how he knows what he's going to need.  I'm going to need this thing that shoots exactly 75 yards and just has this exact hook that  fits right into there.  I'm going to bring that with me tonight.  I need that.  Thank you, Alfred.  So the guy comes to you in Vegas.  She comes to me and he's one of the ones waiting afterwards.  Yeah.  And he says, it's great because he says, you know, I was an Orthodox Jew and I listened  to your show and I've become an atheist and it's a really big deal for me.  And when someone says that, it's so intense. 
[02:42:30]  You kind of go, thank you.  And you kind of try to run away.  It's very hard to give the appropriate response back because it means everything to me.  I understand the power of it, but you don't know what to say.  So you kind of do that eye contact thing.  And he goes, you know, there was bacon on the airplane, but I wanted to have my first  treif meal with you.  And I go, uh, come on backstage.  So we go backstage.  But did you have any doubt there? 
[02:43:00]  Or, I mean, that's a big responsibility.  Don't you think?  I guess so.  Except that I don't believe in God.  So you were overly excited.  Like, let's do this.  Yeah.  So I went back and I go, sure.  Eat anything you want.  And he goes, well, it's, it's Turkey and it's fruit.  And I guess it's not actually been blessed, but it's not very exciting.  I was kind of hoping when I went backstage, you'd have like big bacon cheeseburgers and  stuff.  And I go, we don't have it all the time.  It's not like the, the non-Jews.  All we do is eat bacon, which is a mistake. 
[02:43:30]  We should.  Uh, so we call, you know, we find out if the place is open and then all of us, the piano  player and our crew and everybody just go out for this perverse communion, last supper,  first supper thing.  And we put him in the middle.  Like, you know, he's, he's like Jesus in the, you know, the Da Vinci painting.  We're on each side.  And we just say, you know, we want, and the waitress comes over, you know, and says, what  would you guys like?  We go, we're already for everybody.  And Teller goes, we'll have, um, clam chowder, clams on the half shell, oysters. 
[02:44:00]  Uh, we'll have the pork ribs.  We'll have the pork roast.  We'll have a bacon cheeseburger, a side of bacon and, uh, shrimp.  And she goes, who's that for?  And Teller goes, for him.  So then, uh, he's sitting there and all of a sudden all this food comes out.  This is food.  This guy's, uh, knocking on 40.  He's in his thirties, you know, uh, this is food that for his entire life, he has been  told is pure evil.  Yeah.  Okay.  He has spent his life avoiding this. 
[02:44:30]  And now the whole table is full of it.  And our, uh, one of our, uh, crew guys, who's kind of a punk just goes, you know, man,  I was going to go home and like watch TV.  And if you don't actually eat this shit, I'm going to fucking ram it down your Jew throat.  So just another point of view, you know, just Teller and I are being very respectful  of this moment.  And Zeke, you know, wants Zeke, who is the fan of you guys.  He wants to get it to happen.  Good old Zeke.  No.  Like, I'm shocked at the guy who's our fan.  Of course.  Yeah.  I'll shove it into your Jew mouth. 
[02:45:00]  In fact, he just thinks, he just thinks that this, the heavy moment has to include the  threat of physical violence.  Otherwise, why are we here?  So just kind of as a joke, uh, as the food sitting there and there's this whole moment  we're taking, Teller just picks up a shrimp and rams it in his mouth.  And he kind of goes, uh, uh, and then Jonesy, who is Welsh and plays piano, all of a sudden  becomes a Tomelic scholar, you know, and he goes, it doesn't really count because he didn't 
[02:45:30]  do it on his own volition.  Teller pushed that.  That wasn't actually the first mouthful.  And then he picks up this big, greasy bacon cheeseburger.  I mean, the symbol of atheist America.  I mean, that, that really should be on the atheist American flag.  This big dripping, you know, the way you really want a bacon cheeseburger to be.  And then after you've eaten it the way you wish it wasn't, you know, exactly.  I know that feeling. 
[02:46:00]  And he just picks it up and the, and the, and the cheese and the bacon are all in his  hands, you know, and he just takes this bite and he goes, wow, that's really good.  And all of a sudden, you know, all of the kind of religious stuff just goes away and he's  just digging the cheeseburger, you know, and we all just, we just eat.  And it's this huge life changing moment.  And I mean, uh, we were all crying. 
[02:46:30]  I mean, it was just this big, it was really like the closest you could get to some sort  of huge atheist baptism.  Was he real, was he visibly shaken while he was doing it?  Was it like a bit, you could tell he was doing something big?  All the things you could guess, all the things you could guess, really excited.  No, no, no.  And then, you know, I wrote about it in my book and used a different name for him.  And then over the past, this is two years ago, three years ago, over the past three  years, he's come out more and more to his family.  Well, that's why I wanted you to tell the story again today.  Cause I wanted an update. 
[02:47:00]  So where's he at now?  Three years later.  I had supper with him last night and it was great.  He sat down and said, I have crab at the, uh, at the, uh, he's ordering for himself  now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  But I mean, I don't think a day goes by.  He doesn't have bacon.  And we've always requested a German waiter now.  I, I felt like I was listening to a celebrity cause I listened to your podcast from time to  time.  And all of a sudden he's talking, he's doing some, the reason rally from, uh, from DC  rally. 
[02:47:30]  Right.  And he's talking, blah, blah, blah.  And finally comes up and you're like, uh, should I tell him who you are?  And he goes, I don't give a fuck.  And it was that guy.  And I'm like, Holy fuck.  That's the guy that I read about in Ben's book.  He's actually been, uh, he's become a bit of a celebrity.  There's a, uh, there's a real movement.  There's a book that just came out and I wish I had the name of it at the top of my head,  but it's a woman who has, who, which is, you know, you take whatever it is for a man  to leave that community and you bump it up a thousand times for a woman.  And she just left the hardcore acidic community. 
[02:48:00]  In Brooklyn, uh, did she, was it in New York?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I, I think I know who you mean.  There's a whole big thing about her, her leaving.  And she's like, she's kind of young, right?  She's not that old.  She's like 26 or something like that.  That's exactly.  Yeah.  Uh, there was one more thing about that.  Oh, what does his family think at this point?  His family, you know, and I always love this.  His family is, and this is true for, there's a few exceptions that are terrible, but this is  true for most people I know that have come out as atheists from some sort of fundamentalist  family.  The family understands that they still love him. 
[02:48:30]  And it's a theological difference.  And he was really kind of shocked and happily shocked that he, like his brother and his,  his, his mother and his father, there's a few, you know, in-laws and stuff that are really  pissed at him.  But overall, they're really supportive and, you know, people tweet me all the time and  say, I'm, I'm about to come out and say, I'm an atheist to my parents.  What's your advice?  And I just go love them.  Remember that, that the love has to transcend that because if, if the love can't transcend  religion, then you're a shitty atheist, you know, because that's all we got. 
[02:49:00]  All we got is each other.  All we got is humanity.  All we got is our life here.  And all we got is love.  So if you're going to sell that out for atheism, you're doing something besides what I call  atheism.  That has to be more important.  You know, I just saw a documentary where a kid was going into the Hasidic community.  He was raised Catholic, but then somehow his mother was Jewish and, and he embraced it  and moved to Brooklyn and grew the past.  It's an amazing, you know, the, the Brooklyn community of Hasids is this wonderful thing. 
[02:49:30]  I mean, the community is just beautiful and how tight knit it is.  And you can just, you know, the way they help each other in business and all of this.  I mean, it's, there's so much to learn about the community and then you get all excited  about the community.  Then of course, the way women are treated and it's horrible.  All you have to do is go to B&H.  I was just going to say B&H.  Every business should be run like B&H.  It's an amazing place.  Amazing.  I never get pissed off in there. 
[02:50:00]  They're always ready to help.  They know stuff.  You feel like you learned something and there's no hassle.  It's so great.  And I went with a, with a.  It's all in steps.  Okay.  You picked out your thing.  Now you go over here.  Now we go over here.  Now you go to this.  Everything is nice.  They're all informed.  It's unbelievable.  And they're wearing funny hats, which is really important.  You know how much more I didn't, I mean, I love doing this show more than any other  show in New York.  If you guys wore funny hats, it would just, boom.  They would just go, if I walked in and Norton's got a big black hat, like a sombrero, and he's 
[02:50:30]  chewing his gum with a sombrero, I would be just going, wow, I didn't think it could  get better.  I finally have an answer to a question.  People come to New York and they go, what should I do?  What should I, where should I go?  One of the stops.  Go to B&H for an hour.  34th Street and 9th.  It's something you just don't see anywhere else.  All the products moving on the conveyor belt above your head.  Because they understand, oh, whoa, if people are stealing our shit, we're going to have  to raise the prices.  So they figure that out with conveyor belts above your head.  They're amazing.  You're watching the product moving around. 
[02:51:00]  It's thievery proof.  Almost thievery proof, unless it's a manager doing it from the back.  And even then, I'm sure they have a system in place to stop it.  And you just know you're being taken care of.  That's great.  You don't question anything.  Yeah.  I went to, with a bunch of Hasids that were in various stages of leaving the community,  I went to a restaurant that's called Trafe, that's in Brooklyn.  And we went there and we were all talking and having a good time.  And we finish and the check comes.  And I reach for the check and two of the people in the full hats and the payists and the whole 
[02:51:30]  thing say, no, no, Ben, we're paying.  And BJ, the guy you're talking about, who kind of invited me, he said to me, he said to  me, this is the first time that this has ever happened in Brooklyn, that two Hasids are  pulling the check away from a goyim from Western Massachusetts.  I mean, the worst kind.  I mean, you can be a non-Jew, but a non-Jew from Western Massachusetts.  I mean, remember in Do the Right Thing, Spike Lee, when he's walking down the street, Spike 
[02:52:00]  Lee says to the guy, go back to Massachusetts.  You know, that is the most, Western Massachusetts is the most non-city.  Because you're not south, but you're still not really northeast.  You know, you're wearing a flannel shirt, you've got a beard, you're kind of a half-hippie.  It's a bad place to be from.  So, you know, a Massachusetts guy there.  So these guys are searching you out now?  I thought this was a one and done, but now you're having dinners all over the place?  Well, once in a while. 
[02:52:30]  You know, one guy came to me, got in touch with us through a website, and said he wanted  me to be the one to cut his payas.  Wow.  Really?  He wanted me to cut his payas off.  Oh, man.  So I'll tell you, if there is a hell, I've just gone past Hitler.  I'm way past Hitler.  Yeah.  That's ballsy.  And we finally have a radio pit.  Let's do that.  Cut your payas?  Well, you would have to agree to it, obviously.  We're going to hold them down.  Although the old opening afternoon said, fuck that agreeing shit. 
[02:53:00]  We're doing this today.  Go get one.  You've mellowed.  You've mellowed.  Yeah, man.  We now get at least a little bit of permission.  Like, maybe I consider doing it.  That's enough.  Hold them down.  Fuck.  You're here for Celebrity Apprentice, obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm...  But I've got to tell you, because this is...  I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff about this.  But, you know, I got pretend fired on a pretend game about pretend business on pretend TV by pretend Trump. 
[02:53:30]  And so he fires me.  And then I work.  He can't fire me.  I don't work for him.  I work for the Rio in Las Vegas.  And I work for Caesars.  And Caesars owns Harrah's and everything in Vegas.  Everything in Vegas is owned by, like, three companies.  One of the companies is Caesars.  They're the biggest.  They're the best.  I've worked for them for 11 years.  The best bosses I've ever had.  Because, you know, the best boss you can have is one that ignores you.  Wow.  You know.  Bravo. 
[02:54:00]  Caesars...  If that was true, we'd have the greatest bosses in history.  I know.  It doesn't work out for us in that way.  They ignore us because I don't think they even know we're here.  But once a year, once a year, you know, one of our bosses comes by the show with, like, a niece and goes,  Hey, it's good.  That's the entire input.  There's not meetings every week about the direction of the show.  And they'll say stuff like, Yeah, you know, one of our secretaries said that you put a new bid in.  Is it going well?  You know, that's the amount of hands-on.  He's describing Nirvana right now for us.  That's great.  They just trust us completely. 
[02:54:30]  You know, and I'm sure if the sales went way down, we'd get a phone call.  Sure.  But if the sales are okay, you know, the seasonally up and down.  They know you're doing it.  So Caesars gets in touch with us.  We've been talking about this for, you know, for months.  But they get in touch with us and, you know, they know, I know when I'm going to be fired.  And they say, Boy, that Opportunity Village, you know, for people with mental disabilities, intellectual disabilities, you really like that charity.  And I go, Yeah, I really like them a lot. 
[02:55:00]  And they say, So you did great at Celebrity Apprentice.  You were great.  And I go, Thanks.  And they go, We loved you on there, man.  You were wonderful.  You were really great.  Because they had to give me time off to do it.  So it cost them a lot of coin for me to do it.  They spent a lot of coin and hope they'll get it back in publicity and so on.  But they still spend coin.  It's out of pocket.  And they go, Yeah, you did great on there.  And they go, Did they just say, like, out of the blue, I love this, What's the prize that Trump gives if you win the whole thing?  And we say, You know, it's a quarter of a million dollars for your charity if you win the whole thing. 
[02:55:30]  And they said, Okay, what do you mean, Okay, we'll write a check for the quarter million to Opportunity Village.  Let's just consider that you won.  Nice.  I love the attitude of, We don't got to do no 13-week NBC show.  You don't have to pretend to fight with Lisa Lampanelli.  You don't have to yell at Lou Ferrigno.  Oh, this is a good charity.  You're a good guy.  We like it.  We'll write a check.  That's the way it's done.  So Opportunity Village finds out, you know, Sunday night that I'm fired. 
[02:56:00]  Then they find out Monday morning they get all the money as if I won.  And weeks earlier.  Because, you know, I'm sure the NBC check, you know, it's going to be announced whatever in May.  And then the NBC check takes a while to cut.  You know, that'll be like, you have to go through people.  And they probably step on it and there's a taste here and there.  You know, it just goes.  It probably has baby laxative in it by the time you get it.  And, you know, this is a check from, like, Caesars.  That's like quarter of a million.  Yeah, we threw in another $10,000 for your trouble. 
[02:56:30]  Here you go.  Wow.  And so they're getting new vans.  They're doing all this stuff.  That's awesome.  You know, that's a hip boss.  Sure.  That's a hip boss that you go on and do that.  They just kind of go, eh, it's okay.  And you notice also I'm saying Caesars, not even the guy's name.  Right.  Because I said, should I talk about it?  Oh, fuck it.  No.  How far in advance did you know when you were getting fired?  Well, when I got fired.  Because it was shot in November.  Oh, gosh.  It was shot long over.  Yeah, way, way over.  Way, way over. 
[02:57:00]  And it's weird because you wait to see.  Oh, I don't watch it.  So you wait to see what people say about how they edited it.  You know, because then they get to do, they know, they shoot everything before they edit it.  So if Trump does something nutty and fires you because he has a wild hair up his ass.  And incidentally, do you know that the phrase wild hair up your ass, it's spelled H-A-R-E.  It means crazy rabbit up your ass and not just like an errant ass hair.  I didn't know that.  Because you're going, big deal.  I always have errant ass hairs.  Yeah, that's easy.  Yeah, but a crazy rabbit. 
[02:57:30]  And an H-A-R-E up your ass, that's not as easy.  That's something.  So if he happens to get a wild H-A-R-E up his ass, if he's sitting on a crazy bunny, as  we say in the modern world, and fires somebody, then they have to go back and edit it so that  there's like a reason for, so they have to go back and like find stuff of me like eating.  That's what they found.  You know, they use footage of me eating to look like I'm doing nothing.  Oh, see, he had a piece of fruit.  No wonder.  See, Trump knew that.  So they put that whole thing. 
[02:58:00]  He knew the whole thing.  And it's, you know, it's about 16 hours a day.  It's six days a week.  And it just doesn't stop.  And they keep like, you know, you have cameras on you that whole time.  And then you have, you know, people like yourself, people like me, you know, two-bit,  narcissistic, mentally deficient stars who are clawing with the other people of the same  kind.  And then they yell at you.  You know, you have people you've seen on TV yelling at you.  And I didn't yell back, you know, but still. 
[02:58:30]  Why would you if it's Lou Ferrigno?  I mean, that would really be a fucking waste to yell at Lou Ferrigno.  I don't hear what you're saying.  Yeah.  Well, he gets, he gets, he gets very angry.  And of course, there's all the jokes about the Hulk, you know, you won't like me when  I'm angry.  Well, I don't.  Are they putting it on or are they genuinely angry?  There's no way to tell.  Right.  You know, there's no way to tell.  That's the question I get asked most.  There's people that I've known.  I mean, you guys know Lisa Lampanelli.  Yeah.  You must know her really well. 
[02:59:00]  And I was, you know, she's crying and ripping herself to pieces.  And she doesn't know if she's doing it for the cameras or she's really feeling it.  Right.  You know, you're kind of into that whole thing.  Right.  And it's just so weird.  And the way I was brought up, no one raised their voices, you know.  Right.  My mom and dad never yelled at each other.  They never yelled at me.  So when someone's yelling, I always assume they're kidding.  Right.  Which is one of the problems that I used to have with old girlfriends, you know.  I hate you, you dick! 
[02:59:30]  Because, you know, my dad, he would never raise his voice unless, you know, if he yelled  shut up, it meant he was joking.  Right.  You know.  If my dad was mad at me, he did that I'm disappointed so I'm pouting thing.  You know, that heartbreak thing.  That's the way we deal with it.  So it was just crazy to be in this world.  And, you know, I would talk to them because you've got nothing else to do.  I mean, believe me, if there had been anyone else in the room, I would have talked to those  people.  But I'm talking to them.  And they talk about, you know, I guess regular people. 
[03:00:00]  Did your family yell?  Oh, it's the complete opposite.  See, that's what I would get from them.  Over the dumbest things, my mom would be in our face yelling.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Sneakers just laying in the middle of my room would cause a yelling fit.  Ridiculous.  So if you were on Celebrity Appendish, would you be screaming?  No.  I had to turn the corner and stop yelling.  I realized it was just hurting me.  No one was listening to me.  I used to have really good points about shit, but I would yell them. 
[03:00:30]  So now people are like, you're just a fucking lunatic.  I'm like, no, but listen to the yelling.  There's some fucking sense in there.  And I finally realized it's just stupid.  No one's going to take you seriously if you just scream all the time.  When I get really angry, I go to, okay.  Yeah.  That's true.  Really quiet.  It's still good to yell.  I like having that in my back pocket, but I realize I can't pull that out too often.  You know John Cleese from Monty Python.  Sure, sure.  So the first time I met Cleese, we're working together in this show over in London. 
[03:01:00]  And there's, you know, as always, it's a TV show.  It is always something fucks up and you've got 15 minutes to do nothing.  Cleese says to me, when you get mad, do you yell?  I said, never.  He goes, your family, did they yell?  Did your mom and dad yell?  I go, no, never, never.  He goes, your friends, you get pissed at each other, you yell back and forth?  I said, no.  He said, me neither.  Never raised my voice.  But both of us have discovered there's nothing funnier than a big guy yelling.  He said, whenever I'm on camera, I want to be yelling. 
[03:01:30]  Because it's funny.  And you look at Fawlty Towers, you look at bullshit, there's nothing but a big guy yelling.  You're an asshole!  That's right.  Yeah, you do yell a lot.  For someone that doesn't yell.  Yeah, it makes me laugh so much.  And that's one of the reasons on that show.  I think everybody, like NBC and the other people, expected me to come on going, then  there's this asshole!  And fuck, you need to shut the fuck up!  You know, they expected that and they got instead, um, sorry. 
[03:02:00]  No, sorry.  I don't like, really, I don't do that anymore.  You really didn't care.  I loved it.  Did you like any of the guys on Celebrity Press?  Oh, we have all the people I liked before.  But I mean, like, did you really like someone or is it more just a casual or all celebrity?  You know, we all like Adam Carolla.  Yeah?  You love Adam Carolla.  I had a misunderstanding with Adam and I got to work out, but yeah.  Yeah, well, whatever it is, work it out.  It was a dumb thing.  It was a dumb thing.  And you know, Arsenio I know for years. 
[03:02:30]  Is he a cool guy?  It's hard to tell.  Well, that's why I'm asking.  I don't know.  I've never met Arsenio.  What's his vibe?  I've heard he's a nice dude.  His vibe is very, very nice and very reserved.  And then he can flip.  He can flip on you and get really weird.  I met Paul, you know, Paul Sr. from Orange County Choppers.  We've had a bit.  Who I just loved.  Yeah, he's a cool guy.  He was just great and cool.  Michael Andretti, who you know how he ended up on Celebrity Apprentice.  Do you know this?  Oh, it's the creepiest, most horrible thing.  So Marco Andretti is this guy in his 20s, piece of ass, good looking, rich. 
[03:03:00]  They put him on there.  He was the youngest guy who was going to be on the men's team.  They expect him to be banging one of the women and have all this intrigue.  You know, they have it all written out.  And NBC knows who's going to do, you know, Penn's going to go apeshit.  And this, you know, he'll be doing this.  And, you know, Adam will say this smart ass thing.  And then this woman will bang anybody.  So we'll put her on.  It's great.  And so they have Marco Andretti, which was a dream.  He's perfect.  Looks good, all cast.  He's like their ace in the hole.  He comes out and does all the press. 
[03:03:30]  And it's great because he's already flirting with Miss America and Miss University.  Yeah, it's perfect.  And then he goes to Vegas to do a race, you know, one of his indie races.  And his best friend is killed right in front of him in the crash.  Remember that crash?  Brutal.  And he all of a sudden gets this big dose of perspective.  Oh, my friend was killed in front of me.  And now I'm going to fly to New York and do a dipshit television show?  Oh, wow.  So he says, I can't do that. 
[03:04:00]  I'm just too...  So his father, Michael Andretti, says, yeah, I'll do it.  So Michael Andretti shows up, who isn't any of the things NBC wanted.  He's not volatile.  He's not young.  He's just a really, really good guy.  So in the middle of all these self-absorbed, narcissistic, redundant celebrities, you have  one guy who's just like a guy.  So all these people are like yelling and carrying on and backstabbing. 
[03:04:30]  And Andretti's going, we supposed to do this task?  So they're getting nothing out of him.  Because, you know...  We had him on the show.  He's great.  You didn't like him?  We didn't get anything out of him.  He's a nice guy, though.  He's a great guy.  I just want to tag what you just said.  Real nice guy.  He's a wonderful guy.  He's a wonderful guy.  But there was no showbiz going on.  Not much going on.  Real guy.  Because, you know, so I spent most of my time talking to Andretti because Andretti has 
[03:05:00]  a lot of information I don't have, like how to drive a car.  Right, right.  And he told me the greatest thing.  He said, no matter how much knowledge I have of automobiles, I cannot explain to my wife  that she can trust the thermostat in our car.  I tell her, it's at 72.  It's fine.  The car will get there.  And she turns it down to 63.  And then she turns it back up. 
[03:05:30]  She does not trust the thermostat.  So that's his whole thing.  So I said to my wife, you know, Michael Andretti's wife doesn't trust the thermostat either.  And he's an expert in automobiles.  So why don't you just keep it at 72?  It'll all be fine.  Do you keep your thermostat right?  Yeah, I don't even think about it.  Never think about it.  To be honest, I don't think about it.  You don't ride your thermostat?  No.  That's Michael Andretti's pet peeve.  That's hilarious.  He drives cars at 240 miles an hour.  Just don't fuck with his thermostat.  Would you do it again?  Would you do Celebrity Apprentice again? 
[03:06:00]  Was it good for you?  Ah, yeah.  You know, all the celebrities talk about this was the hardest thing I've ever done.  Oh, really?  And I just go, have you ever had a job?  Right.  You know, because I believe that the hardest job in show business, who do you consider that to be?  David Letterman or who works the hardest?  Yeah.  Letterman's a good one, man.  Yeah, Letterman.  That's the hardest job in show business.  Now compare that to a 12-hour shift in an emergency room.  You know, Springsteen does a three-hour show.  And then there's some assistant who's sitting at a desk answering phones for eight hours. 
[03:06:30]  Who's working harder?  You know, the guy who's got 40,000 people screaming for him or the person.  So I believe that anyone, so they do these interviews and they go, you know, we want to get an interview of you saying this is the hardest thing in the world.  And I go, what if a coal miner comes home from work, sits down on the couch, and I come off and go, oh, I'm in Trump Tower.  If I want something for lunch, I say, I'd like some Egyptian hummus and maybe bring some of those little mandarin oranges. 
[03:07:00]  Could I have that in 10 minutes?  And it's 12 minutes.  And this guy's been working at a coal mine all day.  He's going to sit down on the couch to relax.  And I'm there telling him how hard I'm fucking working.  I will not do that.  So it is 16 hours a day, six days a week is a long schedule for show business.  If you work at USAMRID and you're flying around the world to infectious disease centers and hot zones and fighting Ebola and watching children die  and hoping you don't end up puking shit out of your mouth and dying in front of your family, that's a harder job. 
[03:07:30]  It's just a harder job.  Do they really feed you stuff to say like that?  Like, hey, could you make it like this point of view?  How old is he?  I thought that they just let the cameras roll and whatever would happen would happen.  No, they do that too.  But they also go, you know, you sit in the room.  Wow.  I think they got lazy with reality shows.  I didn't think they'd be that fucking audacious.  No, no, it's not really audacious.  You have to understand it's not really a thing.  I'm the producer. 
[03:08:00]  I got a cameraman and a sound man, okay?  And you go in and you got to do your confessional, okay?  So you're on the show.  It's time for your confessional.  We have got to sit there for like an hour and 15 minutes or an hour and a half and you  have to tell me everything you're feeling.  So I go, okay, Jim, Clay Aiken yelled at you a little bit today.  How'd you feel about that?  I really wanted to punch him right in his throat, but I felt it would be a bad move and I'd be  thrown off the show.  So I just kind of had to take it.  It was irritating.  They would love that.  Really? 
[03:08:30]  They would love that.  And then you go.  Fuck, Jim, you're made for this.  Yeah.  But then you get to the point and they go, so is this hard?  And if you go, no, they go, well, you've been here a long time.  You know, and you go on like that.  It's more frustrating than hard.  I don't know if I'd consider it hard, but it is very frustrating to have to deal with  a guy whose bare chest I did enjoy in those screen caps and then to have him screaming  at me like that.  Yeah, and I know what you're saying.  They can just continue questioning you.  But they're not lying.  I know what you mean.  Yeah, yeah, right.  They're not saying you say this.  But they're going to question you until they hear what they're kind of looking for. 
[03:09:00]  Unless you're enough of a nut.  And you'll notice when you watch Celebrity Apprentice, there's none of the confessionals  of me because I talk about the Cold War.  I talk about Watson and Crick and DNA.  You're going to out-talk anyone.  So they're going to just give up.  So I go on any subject they want and they think I'm going to get to the point.  I talk about the recording session with Sinatra at Columbia in 58.  You know, that brings me back to your podcast because I said it before the show, but you got  stopped by an officer out there. 
[03:09:30]  Where do you live?  L.A. area?  Well, Vegas.  Oh, Vegas.  Excuse me.  You're out there full time.  We covered this material.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Las Vegas.  And you were texting.  I would know.  But your car was completely stopped.  Completely stopped.  And this new law just went in that you're not allowed to look at your screen ever.  Ever.  And that law just went in.  And, you know, the day the law went in, I guess, I stopped at a stoplight and I checked  about three blocks from my house.  I checked my email and the light turns.  And the guy cherry tops. 
[03:10:00]  And as I explained many times, every artist...  And he had to get off his phone so he could pull you over.  Yeah, probably.  I was in Central Park the other day and I got video of it, but I just can't go down that  road.  A cop driving and texting.  I'm like, we're all doing it.  Who are we kidding here?  And I do have the video, but I feel like that would be just a completely dick move.  I do support the cops and stuff in general.  But anyway, so he stopped you for texting at a red light, right?  But, you know, every artist has his venue where he is his best. 
[03:10:30]  And I believe I am at my best when pulled over by police officers.  And the reason is that I don't do drugs and I don't drink.  So I always have this feeling of innocence.  That other people don't have.  Any of my friends that are pulled over, they're afraid there's a little dope in the car somewhere.  Or maybe there's a little tiny bit of alcohol in their blood.  Or they're just going to be a little careful.  I don't care.  I know there's nothing in my car.  It's a brand new car.  So he comes over and I go, hey, do you keep a diary? 
[03:11:00]  What?  Do you keep a diary?  Do you know how...  No, no.  How do you keep a diary?  I don't...  Because this is a special day for you.  You've just pulled over the first all-electric car that's in Nevada.  And you know something?  You know something?  This is the first one.  This is a Nissan Leaf.  They come out in July.  And I've got the first one and you pulled it over.  Do you know what that means?  Do you know why?  Do you know what that means?  Because I'll tell you what that means.  That means when we're pulled over, stopped here. 
[03:11:30]  If we were in a regular combustion car, the engine would be idling, which means those cute  little polar bears, they'd be kind of fucked.  But with the way we are now, with an electric car just sitting here and you standing there,  we could stand here talking forever.  We're not hurting the environment.  We could stand here until some drunk driver comes along, boom, runs you over and you're  dead.  We'll be fine.  He goes, well, I hope that doesn't happen.  And I go, that's exactly my point.  Our hopes and dreams are different.  And he says, you know, I need to see your paperwork. 
[03:12:00]  I go, what is that?  He goes, you know, your license.  I go, yeah, and what else?  And he says, your registration and insurance.  I go, let me tell you something cool.  If the registration and insurance is not someplace in this car that I can find it, an assistant  gets fired.  There's going to be somebody, you know, college student working hard who's getting her ass  fired because of you.  That's going to be on your head.  And I say, now I've got to use my phone to look into the, use it as a light to look 
[03:12:30]  in the glove compartment.  He said, you can't have a handheld device in your hand when you're in control of the  vehicle.  I said, but I believe you're in control of the vehicle because you pulled me over and  if I wanted to drive away now, you'd stop me.  So you're in control of the vehicle.  So I'm going to, he said, well, no, turn your overhead light on.  I said, I don't know how to.  It's a brand new car.  Did I mention that?  So I pull out the book, the book on the leaf and I start thumbing through it. 
[03:13:00]  And he goes, your license and registration is not going to be in there.  And I go, no, no.  I haven't really read the book and I thought we could go through it together.  And I go, you know, you're standing there in Vegas with all these drunk drivers, you're  in a really dangerous position.  You want to get in the car with me?  So I finally, he, he kind of reaches in and goes, here's your license and registration.  Here they all are.  And they're all fine.  You know, he's not, he's not helping me.  He's getting mad.  And we go, no, he's not mad at all.  He's just kind of laughing and exasperated and just kind of going up and I go, you're 
[03:13:30]  going to write about this?  He goes, I have, I go, you know, I'm on my way home.  We're having movies there.  You want to come by?  So we just have a, I mean, have a fabulous time with him.  And it goes, and we're probably pulled over for like 15 minutes, you know?  And he finally says, uh, well, I'm just going to let you off with a warning this time.  I go, do you think that makes any difference to me at all?  Do you think this is going to change my behavior in any way whatsoever?  He says, no, all just a waste of time. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, but it was wonderful.  I love it.  And you know, when you, you enjoyed the conversation, I love getting pulled over by police because  most people, when I'm talking, walk away from me, but he can't because he could have a criminal  there.  You know what I mean?  He doesn't know.  You know, and I guess I kind of crossed a line saying that I hope to get hit by a drug  driver, but he knew in my heart, I didn't mean it.  He knew it was just a joke.  And also that's wicked dangerous.  I don't like the cops do that because in Vegas at any given time, 40% of the people on the 
[03:14:30]  road are shit faced.  Yeah.  You know, everybody's driving drunk there.  I mean, the two things we're good at in Vegas is driving drunk and suicide.  Suicide.  Oh, of course.  A lot of stuff.  They kind of bury that, don't they?  That's not in the papers all the time, is it?  Actually, that's the new slogan.  What happens if Vegas stays in Vegas, come here to kill yourself.  That's what they mean by that, people are fucking killing themselves.  And that's why they're staying in Vegas.  I'll tell you something creepy.  You know, we were working on, you know, we do the bullet catch in our show. 
[03:15:00]  So we do a lot of handgun stuff.  We had a lot of training.  And so we were at one of these shooting ranges, you know?  Yeah.  And the guy says, oh, man, this creeps me out so much.  The guy says, you know, the horrible thing about working here is when the shooting stops.  And I go, what?  And he goes, sometimes, you know, we're sitting at the desk.  It's a 24-hour shooting place.  Guy comes in and asks, you can rent a gun and some ammo. 
[03:15:30]  And he goes into the range.  And we're sitting here doing paperwork.  And we hear, bang!  Bang!  Oh, my God.  He said, then nothing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then we know we've got to call the police and clean up.  Oh, how often?  I mean, I didn't ask him.  Enough where it bothers him.  You just asked often.  I'm saying if that happens to be once in 100 years, I'm pretty freaked out.  And, you know, you're sitting there.  You're on the night shift at a gun range in Vegas. 
[03:16:00]  How much do you get paid for that?  Yeah.  And you're sitting there.  And all you're hearing all night is bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Get the TV on over there.  Checking your texts.  Doing a little bit of paperwork.  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Wow.  Boy.  Wow.  I learned something today.  Well, you'd think that when you came in, they would say, how'd you do with the tables?  Yeah, exactly.  That should be the first question before they give you the fucking pistol.  Yeah, right.  How you feeling today?  How you feeling today? 
[03:16:30]  You know, the guy had you, you know, this is, put it on my credit card.  Put a little something for yourself there.  You know, there must be subsides.  You know what I love about Vegas is going two blocks off the Strip, and you see the  real fucking Vegas.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How scummy and dirty it is.  It's that close to the main road, too.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, people think that that whole...  And, of course, now that, you know, Obama, for some reason, has this hard-on for Vegas  saying, don't go there.  Yeah.  Why is he saying that?  Maybe he's trying to balance what just happened with that GSA fucking scandal. 
[03:17:00]  He's trying to balance.  Which is also, why are you buying commemorative coins when we have hookers in Vegas?  What the hell?  I mean, that is...  I'm outraged by that, but just the way they spent their money.  A mind reader, a clown, and commemorative coins?  Yeah.  And that's what's representing Vegas?  Right.  We have better stuff than that.  Go see the Blue Man Group.  Have yourself a good time.  Hookers.  Yeah, there's a girl with a dick who needs to go through college.  Yes.  I hated the Blue Man Group. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, did you?  Do you know those guys?  I love them.  I love them.  So, I'm just going to stick up for them.  All right, all right.  I just adore them.  By the way, I have to clear something up with Penn.  Yeah, Penn.  Which I forgot about.  What?  You went after Jim Norton?  No, he didn't go after.  I would say he went after.  What?  Yeah, he went after.  When?  When?  How?  No, he just misunderstood something I did.  I just keep forgetting.  What happened?  Tell me.  When you did your video podcast, you thought that I attacked people at Comic-Con.  You didn't throw anything.  You just, you thought that I, you said that you loved me. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  You're like, but then he makes fun of, you're talking about people mocking Comic-Con people  and you thought I mocked Comic-Con people.  Did you?  Yeah, I did say that.  You know, I did.  I did believe that.  I did a Leto piece, but wasn't mocking them.  It wasn't, okay.  And the bit I did is Chip Chipperson.  Yeah.  Where I sound like I'm being mean to them.  The joke is really that Chip stinks and my jokes are awful.  So, it really wasn't a mockery of them.  So, I kind of fell for an Andy Kaufman thing.  Yes.  Well, it's not really Andy Kaufman.  It's not even as deep as what Kaufman would do because it is kind of punchline driven  for people who know that just Chip stinks.  But the joke is that the Chip's jokes are terrible. 
[03:18:30]  But you thought I threw the Comic-Con people under the bus, but I really didn't.  Oh, I'm very sorry.  No, no, because you didn't throw me under the bus.  Yeah.  But I certainly...  That clip.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Chip at TV.  Yeah.  He's playing his character.  Yeah, I was just doing that really.  Just being an unfunny fucking mox.  Well, then I misunderstood.  Yeah.  But I hope I said in there that I love you.  You did.  Oh, no, you did.  Penn, you're very nice.  It would have been so much better if you guys grew up in families that yelled.  I did.  I got yelled at, you know, and soap in the mouth and all that stuff.  Soap in the mouth.  Did you really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, really? 
[03:19:00]  Teeth fucking teeth scraped with soap.  Wow, we didn't have the soap in the mouth.  Yeah, well, I'll tell you...  Helped.  You know, I have...  My daughter is six and my son is five.  My daughter is Moxie and my son is Z.  And they're playing in the sandbox and I'm reading next to them.  And all of a sudden, Z, my son who's five, sees a bug.  And he sees a bug and goes, what the fuck?  Because it's a bug.  You know, you're in a sandbox, you see a bug.  What do you say?  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Why not?  And Moxie, who's my daughter, who's a teacher's pet and just goody-goody and kind of a little 
[03:19:30]  sickening.  She says, daddy, daddy, Z said a bad word.  And daddy says, shut up, Moxie.  Because if you see a bug, you've got to say, what the fuck?  Where do those names come from, Moxie and Z?  Moxie is...  I love it because it's an American word.  It was invented for a soda.  It's a soda in Maine called Moxie.  And now it means, you know, balls, guts. 
[03:20:00]  And that's her first name.  And then Z's name is Zoltan.  And that's my wife's maiden name.  So his maiden name is that.  And then my daughter's middle name, my son's middle name is Penn, which makes me real happy.  And then my daughter's middle name is Crimefighter, which I get a lot of shit for.  All the stuff on the web talks about, you know, asshole celebrities or their asshole children's  names.  You made that list.  And it always says, you know, Moxie, Crimefighter, Gillette.  And I get all the heat for it. 
[03:20:30]  It was entirely my wife because my wife doesn't have a middle name.  So when she was pregnant, we're talking about our daughter.  We're going to name her.  We decided on Moxie.  We love that name.  It abbreviates to Mox.  And I figure if she keeps the weight off and is good looking, she'll be Mox the fox.  And if she gets fat and ugly, she'll be Mox the ox.  It's her choice.  It's her choice.  You know, she'll make that decision at 14 how many onion rings she wants.  Up to you, Mox.  I went, as you can see, Dad went with the onion rings.  You can eschew the onion rings if you like, and you'll be Mox the fox. 
[03:21:00]  Your choice.  And then I said, what's her middle name?  And Emily says, middle names are bullshit.  Fuck that.  And I go, well, she goes, I don't even know your middle name.  And I'm married to you.  You know, no one knows your middle fucking name.  And I go, it's Fraser.  And she goes, oh, yeah, I did know that.  And she goes, well, middle names don't mean anything.  And I go, yeah, I just kind of thought, you know.  And then Jonesy, our piano player, the Pan and Teller Show, had just read my novel, Sock. 
[03:21:30]  And in it, one of the characters says, from now on, call me Crimefighter.  And he says, why don't you call her Crimefighter?  And Emily, my wife, says, you want a middle name, asshole?  Fine.  It's Crimefighter.  Nice.  And I go, you know, I'm going to take the heat for this, right?  Everybody's going to say Penn Jillette crazy.  She goes, good.  You take the heat for that.  It's Crimefighter.  And then I get excited because I figure when she's pulled over by the police, which is, of course, all I live for,  she'll be able to pull out her driver's license and say, officer, we're on the same side. 
[03:22:00]  My middle name is Crimefighter.  And it's worked.  My wife got pulled over for speeding.  And she doesn't do the real performance art that I do.  But she did say, do you know who this is in the back seat?  And he said, no.  And she goes, that's Moxie Crimefighter Gillette.  And the police officer goes, yeah, I heard about that.  That's really cool.  That's the little crimefighter.  Hi there, little crimefighter.  No speeding tickets.  Just walked over.  So it's already been worth it. 
[03:22:30]  It's awesome.  He lives an exciting life, doesn't he?  He does.  He really does.  Whenever I sit with him, and this is the second time I've been with you, I always walk out going, I've got to do more.  I've got to do something with my wife.  It wouldn't work the same for you.  You try it, and then the cop would go, smart ass, and fucking hit your teeth in a flashlight.  You'd be missing teeth.  I just want to go for coffee with this guy.  Just getting coffee with Penn's got to be an adventure.  I try to make adventures out of things.  Yeah, it's funny.  We've had dinner once in Vegas, and he was with my ex-girlfriend and myself in Penn. 
[03:23:00]  He was a fine dinner companion.  Very enjoyable person to eat with.  I want to just go to Vegas to see the show.  It's phenomenal.  I haven't been to Vegas in a while, but next time I go, that's where I'm going.  You've got to come by.  Fuck that Copperfield shit.  Make sure you let me know.  I will.  Because we can hang out.  I had a great time with the...  I will.  And he'll cut your payas off.  Bacon cheeseburgers.  I didn't know Penn honored requests like that.  I should have said, I haven't been blown ever.  I need to fucking hire a chick to blow me.  I've got to milk this next time.  Everybody's crying. 
[03:23:30]  You know, I believe that we only exist to have good stories.  And I think that me blowing Jim would be a really good story.  Oh, that's up to you.  I just want you to pay for it.  It's a better story if I do it.  Much, much better.  Much better stories.  And with a cheeseburger.  So who wins Celebrity Apprentice?  You've got enough money to tell us.  I know you have enough money.  I know you signed something, but fuck that.  Who wins this thing?  Let's make some news today.  Who do you think wins it?  Who's left? 
[03:24:00]  Lisa's there.  Lisa's there.  Aubrey's there.  Aubrey, right.  Huh?  Clay?  Clay's there, obviously.  Clay's there.  They're so old.  Di, you know, Miss Universe.  Di and one more.  What's that?  The housewife lady?  Teresa and Arsenio.  Teresa is a psycho, isn't she?  I didn't have interaction with her.  She's from New Jersey housewives.  I get fired before.  There's a few people I was never on the same team with.  I wasn't really with Debbie Gibson at all. 
[03:24:30]  I didn't really overlap with certain people.  You know, I just spent most of my time with.  They divide it, which is so kind of 50s, to divide it men and women, you know?  Yeah.  That seems so, you kind of feel like you're on like some 50s show.  Do they figure that will get more controversy going?  Are men more likely to fight with other men?  Is the dynamic of male and female not being together?  It's harder for men to work shit out amicably than a man and a woman, because with a man  and a woman, maybe somebody will give because of that dynamic, whereas with two women, they  might just be catty twats, or two guys. 
[03:25:00]  Actually, the original name of the show was catty twats.  It was Donald Trump's catty.  Well, the double T is so they can copy right it.  You know, I just realized that.  You're fired.  You're fired.  I just realized I don't care who wins.  There's my answer, man.  There's my answer.  Now that you're off, who gives a fuck?  I think the answer is that I won.  I got a quarter of a million dollars from Opportunity Village.  That's awesome.  Cannot do better than that.  Yeah.  Your guy's telling us you got to go.  You got other press. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, yeah?  And we're ending anyway, so I guess it works out.  Sunday school.  I'm a fan.  Okay, cool.  Thanks.  Go find that on iTunes, Pendulet's podcast, and Pendulet on Twitter.  You don't have to promote that.  It's like almost two million followers or whatever.  Jesus.  And the show is honestly great.  I mean, I really loved it.  My ex and I went and saw it, and fuck, it was a great live show, man, at the Rio.  Who saw it recently?  Was it Danny that came in here and said?  Somebody just said they saw it recently, and they were blown away.  Yeah, we're also putting a lot of new stuff in, you know?  We got no reason to, you know? 
[03:26:00]  We're just doing this stuff purely because we want to.  We just put in a bit called I'm a Little Teapot.  He's a Little Teapot, actually.  It takes, I mean, this is what I always wanted to be when I was young.  It takes about two and a half minutes of stage time.  We worked on it two years and three months and almost $100,000.  And it's like two and a half minutes, it's gone.  And I really want the audience, you know, it's just a stupid trick, but it's impossible. 
[03:26:30]  It's the hardest magic you'll ever see.  And we totally bury the lead.  Don't let anybody know it's difficult.  Don't underline it, nothing.  And we always, you know, people after the show go, I don't think anybody noticed how hard that trick was.  And I go, you did.  Right.  You know, you're in the audience.  You're not magic.  You're not special.  Why two years?  Because nothing works.  It's really hard.  So you rebuild it and you rebuild it.  And you can't fuck up once even, right?  Although you told that great story on our show where you fucked up once.  Yeah, we can fuck up. 
[03:27:00]  But, you know, the thing is, magic is like if every time you wrote a song you had to invent the instruments.  You know?  So we get this idea for a bit where, you know, Teller's going to be a little teapot.  He'll go in the audience.  He'll take his jacket off.  He'll show that his arms are clean.  He'll walk up on stage.  He'll stand in place.  And I will start singing, he's a little teapot, short and stout.  Here is his handle.  Here is his spout.  He'll get into that position like a five-year-old.  And it'll just be like, boy, it's this stupid.  They've lost their minds. 
[03:27:30]  It's stupid.  And when he says, tip me over and pour me out, I will lift him up, I will pour him, and water, tea, hot tea, will flow out of his hands into a cup.  And then I'll just put him down.  And then I'll walk behind him to show there's no device behind him.  And then I'll do the second verse of teapot.  He's a clever teapot.  Yes, it's true.  Let us show you what he can do.  He can change his handle on his spout, tip him over, pour him out.  And then with the whole audience ready for it, Teller will roll up his sleeves.  I will pick him up, and I'll pour water out of the other arm. 
[03:28:00]  And so that's wicked hard.  Because you're doing a complete levitation.  I mean, it's the Copperfield flying.  You know, Copperfield does flying.  It's a fabulous trick.  It's eight minutes with a huge buildup.  He's flying all over the stage.  This is exactly as hard as that because I can't pick him up and pour him out.  And we also have the production of water from bare hands with sleeves rolled up.  So I just want to say it's his fault, Rowling. 
[03:28:30]  When Rowling comes in, that means your people are panicking.  I just want your people to know it's his fault.  We haven't even gotten to the steeping in this picture.  It really is Penn's fault.  You tell them.  So you sit down with the people and go, we want to do He's a Little Teapot.  And you're building shit.  You've got to levitate a full person on stage and no one can see it.  Then you've got that fucking T.  And you wouldn't believe one year into it when we're saying to each other, how important is the water coming? 
[03:29:00]  I mean, isn't it funny enough that we do a full levitation?  Isn't that enough?  Isn't that enough?  And we go, yeah, that's enough.  No, fuck it.  We've got to get the...  And that's another year.  That's amazing.  So that's, you know, we put that new shit in and we get a new bit where we dress a cow as an elephant and vanish it surrounded by an audience.  Real, real cow.  And we've been working with that fucking cow for, that's three years.  Wasn't there some story, some guy was out there trying to bust some of your stuff? 
[03:29:30]  Oh, there's people that steal shit all the time.  Yeah.  But I, my feeling is we're doing it, people know that it's ours, so I don't worry much.  Telly gets a little bit more tense about it, but not me.  I've got to leave.  I've got to go do some of the thing.  SomedaySchool.com, Penn Jillette.  We're leaving, too.  Hold on one second, Penn.  Tom, where are you at?  I'm in Denver this weekend at the Comedy Works.  Be good, buddy.  All right, and Jimmy?  I will be with my boys shooting my special.  We will be in Cleveland at the Hard Rock on Friday from 3 to 7 p.m. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  It's going to be a great, great fucking crazy experience in Cleveland, I hope.  And I'm looking forward to shooting the special finally.  I'm dying to.  When are you doing it?  Saturday at the Ohio Theater.  Oh, awesome.  Right on.  Awesome.  But I want to thank Penn Jillette again.  Do I have to do this now?  Did she leave her?  Fuck.

Huh?  Yes.  You were a minute ago.  I know. 
[03:32:30]  No, you're being casual.  Sam.  Yeah.  Me and Tom don't have the energy to get up to talk into a mic.  Can you hear us?  Yeah, I turned on every mic in here.  One of them is picking you guys up.  I don't want to say this the wrong way.  Yeah.  We truly love Penn Jillette, but we both feel very exhausted right now.  Well, he's got a lot to say.  I told Tom, we're just having a conversation, I'm like, he challenges your listening ability.  Is that what it is?  Because I would think that it'd be like almost easy because you don't have to do a lot of  poking and prodding. 
[03:33:00]  He's fascinating.  I mean, I really want people to listen to this, you know, closely.  Understand.  Yeah, understand.  He could, there are people who could talk, but they have nothing.  Those people are fucking, should be shot.  But Penn Jillette at least, you know, has a million things he could talk about and it  makes them all interesting, but he challenges your listening skills.  You just switch them on and he goes.  I feel like I ran a marathon.  Look at us.  And yeah, you guys, we're just lounging.  They're both on the back in the couch in the corner with Mike sort of near them. 
[03:33:30]  It's exhaust.  It's like being next to a roaring river.  Right.  Yeah.  It really is.  I feel like we just got off like a class five rapid.  I feel like we're at a police station and we saw some horrific crime and we're just  waiting to talk to the captain.  His wife must be hard of hearing.  Oh my God.  And so what are you, are you, are you, his wife must have hearing aids because yeah, our  ears are shot.  And what's, what's the exhausting part of it?  You have to listen. 
[03:34:00]  Just listening and trying to figure out what you're going to ask him based on.  Dude, think about it.  In this day and age, no one listens.  Yeah.  It, you, if you have to listen to someone for more than 30 seconds, that's a lot in this  new world.  Yeah.  We just listened to, uh, Penn for an hour straight.  An hour straight.  And he's got, he's got a 10 minute answer to any question.  Oh yeah.  And you have to, he keeps you engaged.  Like you have to kind of respond, not, you can't get a word in, but he'll, you have to  visually respond and he wants, he's constantly working for your attention. 
[03:34:30]  The best part is you think you kind of lay low, like, oh, I'll just let him talk.  I don't even have to listen.  And then he's so aware.  I told Tom this, some people that talk a lot are not aware of the room that everyone's  falling asleep or like, holy fuck.  He's very aware of the room on top of it.  And if you're not listening, he's going to call you out.  And that's why he asked me that one question.  When you were growing up, did your parents yell at you?  I'm like, oh fuck.  He's asking me something.  Boom.  Just threw the conversation to you.  Because he felt like maybe I wasn't engaged anymore.  I was so relieved he was talking to you. 
[03:35:00]  I was like, I don't know what's happening right now.  Is it like the radio version of a pop quiz?  Like, oh my God, I'm going to have to work for this one.  I don't know.  That's a terrible analogy.  Horrendous.  So make one then.  Make a better one.  You're usually pretty good, Sam, but you fell on that one.  We did already.  We saved the class five rapids and we went through a whole thing.  That wasn't we.  That was you, Tom.  That wasn't both of you.  He is one of my favorite people to have on the show, though.  Well, he's interesting.  Absolutely.  And you're right when you said he's not just coming in here and talking to talk. 
[03:35:30]  Like, he's actually, just because he's dominating the conversation doesn't mean he's not actually  having a conversation.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Woo!  Wipes you out, though.  Is his daughter's middle name really Crimefighter?  Yeah.  I guess.  Sound like it.  He's not a liar.  See, I'm from the school that I want to name my kids, like, a little different.  You do?  I really do.  Is there a book for that?  Why?  No, if you wanted to name your kids different, you shouldn't be looking at a book.  Yeah, but I need some, like, examples. 
[03:36:00]  Why do you want to name your kids?  That's that different, Ken.  I can't just name your kids and share.  Because when you hear a unique, different name, it always makes sense.  Like, oh, fuck, that's cool.  Yeah, but the reason it's unique is because it's not in a book.  Megaphone.  It's in a book.  Megaphone.  Book.  Book.  Book.  Name book.  But Moxie.  Moxie's a great name.  Moxie is good.  But no one names their kid Moxie.  But it works.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you really, it's a risk, though.  A little worried about a girl named Moxie in Vegas.  True.  Yeah. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, he didn't give the other scenario.  Yeah.  Or on a pole.  Right.  Moxie could be on a pole.  Yeah.  And then on a billboard that he has to see all the time.  Yes.  Yeah, but you don't want to go super different.  Like, you don't want to go so different people think you're an ass.  No, it's got to be like, it's got to be where it stops people in the track, in their tracks and goes, oh, wow, that's cool.  That's different.  That's a good name.  Yeah.  You go with regular names for your kids?  Yeah, pretty regular.  Yeah.  Italian regular.  I went New York regular. 
[03:37:00]  Like, Apple is a horrible name for a kid.  Not really.  Apple?  Apple is a bad name.  Whose kid's Apple's not a bad name?  Gwyneth Paltrow.  Right.  It's easy to say that that's a bad name.  It's really not that bad, if you think about it.  It's bad.  If there was a kid in my school named Apple, I would make fun of them every, I'd make fun  of her every day of her life.  Anything Gwyneth does is good.  You think so?  Yes.  Yeah.  Because that's the other thing.  Like, it's not just cool to adults.  Kids are going to make fun of this name.  Sam, have you promoted my Twitter as I sit here, or no?  No.  Well, what am I getting out of this?  You know, I'm a guest.  When guests come on shows, they get plugged. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, they also usually talk into a microphone.  You haven't plugged my shows in Denver?  You haven't?  Nothing.  Well, I wanted to make sure, first of all, this time you knew you were actually on the  after show and not Opie and Anthony.  I'm an after show veteran.  I love when Tom Papa replies to my tweets.  It makes me feel a little better about myself.  Does it?  And he does it every once in a while.  No pressure.  You don't have to do it any time soon.  You've done it enough.  Trust me.  That's what I'm going for here.  But every once in a while, I'll see a little Tom Papa retweet or a little reply. 
[03:38:00]  And I feel just a little happier.  You like that.  I'm not going to lie to you.  It's a celebrity retweet.  That's what Penn Jillette does to you.  He just makes you an honest person.  It just peels back the layers.  And now you just get the pure version of us right now.  Right.  Eric said his middle name is Wood.  Sam's middle name.  Don't you know that?  Your middle name's Wood?  My middle name's Wood.  Yeah.  It's not like a big secret.  And you make fun of weird names?  That's a weird name?  Apple?  You have a problem with Apple?  Wood's a better name than Apple.  No, Wood.  You would be made fun of in school for having a name like Wood. 
[03:38:30]  That's why you go after other people's weird names.  Because you're insecure about Wood.  That's why it's my middle name.  You get a little Wood.  Woody Roberts.  Oh, by the way, I just tweeted a...  Oh, B.  The whole prom box fell.  Was the tweet that valuable?  Yeah.  Everything fell.  Everything fell down.  No, because everyone was requesting a retweet of the Asian penis.  Everyone?  And I think it went clever, too.  I wrote, by request, the ultimate definition of chink in the armor. 
[03:39:00]  Well, that just sounds racist.  Clever.  Kind of clever, right, Tom Papa?  Yes.  Because everyone's all about that chink in the armor phrase, and now I got the perfect definition of that.  Oh, it's a terrible picture.  By the way, I did not take the picture.  A lot of people were wondering.  It's from an L.A. gym.  Yeah, it's the same thing Roland said, but he still is getting all the credit for tweeting the picture.  Yeah, he is.  His Chris Christie picture.  That's all right.  What are you whispering to E-Rock over there, Roland?  Dude, you have no fucking juice on this show.  Are you fucking kidding me?  I mentioned my Twitter.  I didn't even get one new follower.  Because they're already your listeners. 
[03:39:30]  Tom, did you get any followers from your plugs?  Let me check.  Let me check.  Yeah, but look at your at mentions, and how many people are mentioning Carly Rae Jepsen today.  I think I got two new people.  That's so sad.  It is just so sad.  It's so sad.  I have a guest today, Eric.  Why are you whispering in my headphones instead of just talking to me?  Let's see.  You have him from American Idol?  I like how he's in charge.  I don't have a guest.  Oh, Metta World Peace is a good name.  Oh, he's still going.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he changed his name.  He made that choice himself.  From Ron Artest. 
[03:40:00]  Metta World Peace is a horrible name, Sam.  That's what I just...  Nobody named him that.  Yeah.  Is it weird to you looking at your seat and seeing Sam in it?  I can't wait for someone else to take that seat.  There's nothing on my calendar.  Nobody sent me any emails that said I had a guest today.  Annabelle is saying there's emails confirming...  The guy in the photo is Asian.  Is my name on it?  Yeah.  I didn't get it.  Yeah, it looked like it.  Yeah.  So the one guy writes, how do you know he's Chinese?  I didn't say he's Chinese.  He said Asian.  I didn't say Asian. 
[03:40:30]  I just said chink in the armor.  Oh, chink is Chinese, I guess.  I mean, yeah, of course he can come in.  I'm going to, you know.  But chink in the armor is a phrase, too.  Yeah.  So I went with the phrase.  Yeah, chink in the armor means like an Achilles heel.  Chink in the armor means having a tiny penis.  That would be your flaw.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That would be your flaw.  Your fatal flaw.  That's why it's clever.  Can we go home now, Sam?  Of course you can.  Who's your guest?  I'm going to switch him so I tape it for later.  Who is it?  It's the guy who got voted off American Idol this week.  You got an American Idol guest? 
[03:41:00]  We've never had an American.  Oh, we had...  That's why I'm putting him to tape.  We had Taylor Hicks.  Yeah, that's right.  And then Jay Moore blew it for us by calling everyone a cunt that day.  Why would you say it?  Including a publicist.  Why would you bring that back up?  Because I thought it was awesome.  Apparently there's a crowd downstairs for this guy.  He's the popular kid.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I didn't watch American Idol.  I used to watch.  Yeah, I mean...  You want home, Ken?  It's up to you.  Is Jimmy staying?  He's recording now. 
[03:41:30]  Do we have to wait for him?  It's up to you.  Does he drive you home?  Kenny?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How are you doing, Kenny?  Nice, Kenny.  That is a nice luxury.  Where do you live?  Downtown.  Uh, we're not trying to...  You could...  They're just on the couch there.  I'm supposed to interview Keith Robinson.  Tom Popper and Opie.  Facebook slash Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He cancels some bullshit.  What about it?  Well, timeline stinks, but people can still like me.  It's the worst...  You can whisper.  We can still hear you.  It's like, what's wrong with you? 
[03:42:00]  Publicity.  Yeah.  What?  You can still hear you.  That's what I'm trying to do.  I know.  Was there an accident, Sam?  Yeah.  Opie dumped the whole bin over trying to check his Twitter.  Well, I want to see how much juice you have, and I obviously have none.  I have plenty of juice.  Check for Carly Rae Jeffries.  Juiceless.  I lost two followers.  Well, maybe you're not exactly performing.  You're sitting on a couch, yelling into a microphone that's halfway across the room.  I tweeted a picture of a guy with a baby dick.  That does nothing to do with the after show.  Hey, did you hear Opie and Anthony played my songs today?  Sam?  They didn't like it. 
[03:42:30]  Well, Jim didn't like it.  Well, they were a day late and a dollar short because the after show debuted it.  Exactly.  Debuted it.  They debuted it.  Did you like the Club Soda Kenny song, Opie?  I spelled debut.  What?  Did you like the song?  It was all right.  I like when Kenny sings the hits.  Yeah.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Did you notice they're working on a behind the music with Club Soda Kenny?  No.  It said it in the outro of the song.  You are forcing people to do that.  I don't think Troy's actually doing it. 
[03:43:00]  No, it said so in the song.  What song?  Call Me Baby.  It was one of the things Kenny shouted out.  It said so or you said so.  It.  No, the answer is you.  Kenny, you got any yogurts?  Yes.  I'm starving.  Tom, you want a yogurt?  No, thank you.  I try not to eat dairy.  Would you like a banana?  No, thank you.  They're high in potassium.  Would you like a pop tart?  Would you like Kenny's special banana?  Special banana.  More than a mouthful. 
[03:43:30]  Kenny, we had a nice meal in Cleveland once.  We sure did and that was the first time I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Tom Papa.  That was a nice evening.  You know, E-Rock has a Cleveland salad story.  I thought you were saying Cleveland steaming.  Salad story.  What's the Cleveland salad story, E-Rock?  It's up to Sam.  It's Sam's show.  Of course.  Hi, Sam.  I can't hear him, though.  Put your headphones on.  Well, how about he comes in here and talks like a...  Because he's a producer.  He's running the board.  Oh, boy.  He doesn't need to hit anything in there. 
[03:44:00]  He comes in here.  He talks nice.  He needs to hit things.  He's my producer.  It seems like a lot more work.  It's a show.  We're actually trying to put a nice little show on for the people.  Yeah, people are waiting to, like, say what did they learn today on the phones.  And me and Tom are just exhausted in the corner.  Right.  But because your name's on the wall, I can't exactly, you know, you get top priority.  I don't give a fuck.  No, you don't want to get up off the couch.  Is E-Rock going to tell his Cleveland salad story?  Yeah.  Is he coming in for it?  No.  Oh.  You're going to have to get up and get headphones.  I'm not going to do that. 
[03:44:30]  Well, then you're not going to get to hear the story.  That's fine.  He already told it to me.  Did you like it?  Yeah, I actually did.  I can't front.  Okay, Eric.  Because it's a classic Kenny moment.  What's the Cleveland salad story?  During the promotional tour of Coming to XM, we were in Cleveland.  Nobody can hear it.  They don't have headphones.  I'm worried about the audience, not the people in the room.  There's four people in this room other than me.  We want, well, four more than who you're, oh boy.  Keep going.  I'm so tired.  I'm worried about the listeners at home. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, my God.  I just blew the easiest joke ever.  Yeah, it really was.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  Get me home.  Oh, my God.  I'm done.  Let's go to a request.  JT and PA.  More people.  Yeah, today I learned, Sam, that's a cue.  Sam, that's rude.  You love this.  No, Opie and Tom Papa can't hear what's going on.  Yeah, nobody can hear you now.  That's even more ruder.  Because I want to hear what the calls have to say, not you.  You're just bullshitting again. 
[03:45:30]  That's what I do.  Kenny, you're talking over callers.  It's bad radio.  I have my own agenda.  I know.  It's called bad radio.  Sam.  No, it's not.  Sam.  Yeah?  Would you allow Kenny to give you a wedgie today?  No.  He hasn't done one in a while.  We could give it to somebody else then.  Why?  I'm not going to do it.  Please?  No.  Roland has disposable underwear.  I'm not going to get a follower because of this show.  Look at the juice.  Squeezing a little more out.  One guy.  One guy.  What's his name?  Mark.  Mark?  With a C or a cat? 
[03:46:00]  C.  Nice.  Mark with a C.  If you want more shout outs like that, follow Tom Papa on Twitter.  Sam, I will read the Twitter of every person that follows me right now.  OB Radio on Twitter.  Tom Papa on Twitter.  Follow them now.  Actually, unfollow them and then re-follow them so you can get your little mention.  I will read their Twitter names as they come in.  All right.  Nothing. 
[03:46:30]  Absolutely nothing.  I hate to tell you, but there's a bit of a delay.  Oh.  Why?  I don't want to bring the science into the discussion.  Why?  What's your name?  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  You.  Oh, me?  Yeah, you.  Oh.  I learned that...  Wait, Jim's in the room.  Jim's here.  Ah.  Sorry, buddy.  Fucking...  Mary Lou Henner's doing an interview.  I'm fucking bummed I missed my fucking picture with her. 
[03:47:00]  She looks good, man.  How'd you miss it?  I'm here.  You weren't like waiting outside the door?  No.  I was just talking to fucking Gary.  That was a mistake.  Five times.  The interview's probably 15 minutes.  They said a half hour.  Why do you push the mic away like we can't hear you?  I turn those mics way up.  Anything?  Help?  What do you got going on over there?  We're just talking.  I really want to fuck the picture of Mary Lou Henner.  She's fucking sexy, man.  I think...  I love her.  Did you see her?  Yeah, she looks good.  She's doing it in press right now.  But she looks great.  Taxi is fucking 1979. 
[03:47:30]  I did a thing.  When her book came out...  I didn't.  You don't have a picture with her?  No.  I do.  I want her to...  Wait, did you get...  Oh, sorry.  It's okay, buddy.  Go ahead.  No, no, Jimmy.  No, no, I was just going to say, I wanted more pictures with Taxi.  I had nothing there.  I do want to ask Sam, did you get a picture with Amy Smart?  Yeah, I interviewed her for the Sam Roberts show.  Who is she?  She's fucking hot.  Yeah.  She's a good interview, too.  She's shorter than I thought.  Is she smart or what?  Yeah, she's smart. 
[03:48:00]  Is she a good-looking person?  The picture?  She's really good-looking, yeah.  What does she do?  She's an actress.  She was in Road Trip and Crank, and she's in Shameless now.  She was in that movie with the guy who becomes fat.  Just Friends.  Just Friends.  Is that a whole story?  Yeah.  She's super nice, too.  Yeah, she's very nice.  She was actually...  And we did the interview, and then we went to the lobby to take the pictures and stuff,  and she ended up talking about Bruce with Roland for 15 minutes.  Did you finger her?  I didn't know.  It was an interview.  I spoke to her. 
[03:48:30]  What did you say to Roland?  Stop talking about Bruce?  No, she got a kick out of Roland.  She was laughing at him.  Are you and Jillian now dating?  Wait, Eric is in the room now.  Oh, Jillian again.  We're close to dating.  Eric's in the room.  That's a great picture.  No, everybody just hears you.  It's ambient noise.  She's hot.  Turn on the microphone.  I'll turn on everyone's mic except yours.  Are you dating...  Uh, dating.  Are you dating Jillian?  Jillian Jacobs from Community?  Yes.  Not yet.  She did love Sam.  But we had quite a back and forth on Twitter last night.  I saw that.  She's a wrestling fan. 
[03:49:00]  Who knew?  She goes to wrestling shows.  She's the blonde?  Yeah.  I like the blonde.  I like the blonde.  Where's my boyfriend?  Does she get a boyfriend?  I don't know.  Not for long.  Not if I have anything to do about her.  Corky L.A. douche.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He might be a nice guy.  Yeah, you've never met the guy.  I want to date an actress.  Maybe she doesn't have a boyfriend.  Maybe she's just looking for a wrestling fan to meet.  Jimmy doesn't know why me and Tom Papa are like this.  Like what?  Did Penn Jillette exhaust the hell out of him?  Oh.  No.  No, we're not saying anything bad, Jimmy.  Yeah, no.  He challenges your listening ability. 
[03:49:30]  I find him very interesting.  Like he's easy to listen to.  He could talk about anything.  Yeah.  But it is mentally exhausting.  By the way, I'm getting a lot of tweets that are both you and I are tagged on Opie as  well as you, Tom Papa.  So I feel like you guys are not giving credit to a lot of listeners right now.  Thank you very much.  I haven't added another follower in the last 15 minutes.  Are you looking at your replies, though?  Because they were already following you, but they're also hearing you again.  I don't see any followers.  Because keep in mind, Tom, you've had a stupendous appearance on the after show in the past. 
[03:50:00]  That's true.  I'm a veteran.  You probably picked up a lot of followers that day.  I think I'm the only person to try and plug a national TV event through the after show.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's not true.  That's famous day.  Oops.  That's not true.  Loverboy was on the show.  Shane G73.  Mm-hmm.  Whoa.  I'm getting a lot now.  Oh, look who's got juice after all.  Belly Vankert.  Keith Harmon.  Tom, what does your show air?  Marshall Davis. 
[03:50:30]  Wow.  That's it, Sam.  I got two.  Tom.  Scott L.  What does your show air?  One of the ones that Tom got.  I don't know.  Okay.  We just handed it in.  Oh, you just did it.  Okay.  And this, by the way, you're getting all these followers on this, the worst after show in  the last two weeks.  No, that's a good one, Sam.  Really?  You think so?  Yeah.  We're going to be talking about this one.  This one is a stink of roach because there's no chip call.  Is that what it is?  Chip bails you out every fucking day.  Chuck Knudson says Sam sucks.  He's wrong. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  Also, Chuck Knudson is a name for an idiot.  Yeah, Chuck Knudson.  How come he's not a nut daughter?  Ryan Johnson called me a fucker.  See?  All these people chiming in now.  There's a lot of people listening.  I don't know why, but they are.  Kenny, you want to go take a picture?  Make it all right.  Of who?  Is that a no?  Of Mary Lou Hanner?  Who else?  Who else is it?  Kenny, have you ever said no?  Don't lean into the mic. 
[03:51:30]  It's not on.  Turn the microphone on.  People can hear you in the background.  It's better.  Trust me, Kenny.  I know what I'm doing here.  See, the world revolves around Sam Roberts.  Oh, really?  What world?  He doesn't like anybody else's star to shine brighter than his.  That's not the case.  You blow out other people's candles to make yours shine?  Never.  I think I give plenty of time to everybody here on the after show.  Then turn on the fucking microphone.  People can hear you fine. 
[03:52:00]  Besides, I've given you more than enough chances to shine on the after show, and all you've  done is brought everything to a screeching halt.  He gave you a hit single on the after show.  Yeah, but we, Troy and I had to work with him a lot.  A lot.  And by the way, Troy, he says he likes working with Club Soda Kenny.  He hates working with Club Soda Kenny.  Troy gets so frustrated when he's in there with Kenny.  You saw him.  If that's true, Troy's going to have the worst time in Cleveland.  It's true.  You saw him in there. 
[03:52:30]  He wouldn't even make eye contact with you while you were recording that song.  Yeah.  You know, dude.  That's how Troy was supposed to be.  Yeah.  Come on, dude.  I'm just trying.  We've got to just get this done.  I've got a bunch of shit to do, dude.  Yeah.  And you were in there lollygagging and trying to put in your little creative input.  And sloughing off.  Sloughing off.  To say the least.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, Sam.  We're all going to leave you now.  Bye, Sammy.  Okay.  Bye, Sam.  Thank you all for hanging out.  Yeah.  It was a pleasure.  I'm not turning that off.  When do you guys go?  Friday?  Yes. 
[03:53:00]  Friday is Cleveland.  Everybody join us.  Thank you all for being a part of After Opie and Anthony Live.  It was a pleasure.  Opie.  Opie, you could have cleaned it up, and instead you kicked the mess.  Opie, Tom Papa, Jim Norton, Club Soda Kenny, Roland.  There's something.  We can finally turn off all those couch mics to get that ambient noise down.  They just don't like to put effort into this show, do they, Eric?  Eric, I'm trying to think back when they used to. 
[03:53:30]  After Opie and Anthony Live?  I don't think there ever has been a time.  No.  I don't think they take this seriously.  Opie had one good moment on After Opie and Anthony Live, and that was when he came in  here and he told the story of his son throwing shit at him.  You remember that?  Were you there that day?  Well, all right.  I would say that's, no pun, number two.  Okay.  Jeff Spicoli, the intern.  Sorry.  Who never knows anything because he's a complete stoner. 
[03:54:00]  No, I'm not.  He's a douchebag.  No, I just come on.  He's an idiot.  He's got fake hair.  Is your hair fake?  What?  Is your hair fake?  No.  Turn to the side.  Look at it.  By the way, Eric.  Yeah.  To hear me better just now?  Yeah.  He took his headphones off.  No, no.  He's coming through here.  I saw what you were doing.  Tell him to turn sideways.  Look at the profile.  Yeah, I learned that aliens don't talk to communicate.  That's very good.  That's very good.  All right.  That's a reference to today's show.  Way to go, intern Jeff Spicoli. 
[03:54:30]  When is your intern up?  Are you asking me or Eric?  What?  Eric is not an intern, so his internship expired long ago.  It's up, I guess, in, like, I don't know, May 11th or something like that.  Is this your first or second semester?  It's first.  Eric, is he getting invited back?  You're the intern boss.  He was.  He was invited, but he declined.  You're not coming back for a second semester?  No, I can't.  I have another year of school left, so, you know.  What do you got going on?  Uh, school. 
[03:55:00]  All right, you understand that, like, when you're in school is the only time you have  to intern.  Yeah.  Like, that's when you intern.  They only allow me a certain amount of internships.  I see.  So you're not allowed to have more intern credit?  No.  Or you're saving it so you can do something different and get a more varied wealth of experience?  Well, I could be saving it for another internship here, but right before I graduate, that way,  if I happen to get in the door here, you know.  Yeah, very clever, because you've got the other year of school, and the last thing you 
[03:55:30]  want to do is make an impression, but then go back to school, everybody forgets who you  ever were.  Yeah, like I just did now.  Luckily, you've not made an impression this semester, so you have that going for you.  Sweet.  Let me see what's going on.  Everybody wants to...  Hey, real quick, do you have a live read?  Yeah.  We're running out of time.  Oh, okay, I do that now, and then maybe a couple what-did-you-learns before we go?  Yeah, let's do that.  Well, Eric, this is something.  This isn't a live read.  This is just something I meant to tell you.  I hate...  And by the way, thank you for taking care of that guest situation. 
[03:56:00]  That would be better off pre-taped.  We don't have to worry about all the...  Honestly, she walked in, and she's like, are you all set?  Nobody had a clue that you had this guest.  Yeah, including me.  But then she showed me an email thing, and we're all on it, so I didn't...  Who's all on it?  Roland, you.  It's not in my calendar.  I don't know.  It's on the list there, the 1045 you were supposed to.  I mean, it's not a big deal.  I'll just do it at 11, I guess.  Is that what time it's rescheduled for?  I think it's after that one.  So 1115?  Yeah, we'll check it once we're off the air. 
[03:56:30]  Okay.  I hate Mother's Day is what I was going to say.  I hate Mother's Day.  You're thinking the same thing.  You hate Mother's Day.  Admit it.  Everybody hates Mother's Day, and that's because you didn't know what you were going to say.  You never know what to do.  Every year, you get the same flowers that die in a week, the same picked-over card from  the drugstore, and take Mom out for the same crappy Mother's Day dinner.  This year, take her to a better dinner.  And I have the real solution beyond dinner.  My friend Steven Singer has created the perfect gift for Mother's Day.  A real long-stem rose dipped in 24-karat pure gold. 
[03:57:00]  You can't eat those.  No.  You can't eat them, but they do last forever.  It's the gift that lasts a lifetime, and it's only 69 bucks.  Yes.  $69 to please your mother forever.  Mothers, grandmothers, even mother-in-laws love them.  These real long-stem roses come shipped in a beautiful gift box with your own personalized  card.  What a wonderful gift.  Steven Singer has a special color for each mood you're in.  You could choose from Violet Pearl, which symbolizes admiration. 
[03:57:30]  You could do Peach, which symbolizes appreciation.  You could even do the classic All Gold, which symbolizes respect and eternal love.  I don't know if you give that to your mom.  Maybe you give that to your wife.  Eternal love is weird to give to your mom, just to phrase it that way.  I mean, unconditional love, maybe, but eternal love.  She'll look at you funny.

[03:58:00]  Dan, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah, Sam, I just wanted to tell you that even though it's hours later, I still have  Call Me Maybe stuck in my head.  And what did I say?  And what did I say?  This is a song that gets stuck in everybody's head.  And, you know, Opie, Anthony, Jim, even Tom Papa, I think everybody is starting to come  to the realization that you listeners came to, not too long ago, but recently, but everybody's  kind of realized it.  That this After Opie and Anthony live show is a hot commodity. 
[03:58:30]  It's become a mainstream player in the world of satellite radio.  And it's something that simply can't be ignored.  You can describe it however you want to describe it, but the proof is in the pudding.  After Opie and Anthony live as a show speaks for itself.  And if you and if and if Opie and Anthony don't want to jump on the bandwagon yet, they  don't have to, but they will.  You all did.  Didn't you, Eric?  I'll tell you something that's going to happen.  What?  In a few weeks from now.  Yeah.  Jim was going to come in and said he was listening to this song over and over on his iPod on a 
[03:59:00]  flight back from wherever.  And he may have heard it on a movie or a TV show, and he's going to talk about how great  this song is and totally not realize that we played this for him.  Exactly.  I mean, Eric, you've seen After Opie and Anthony live evolve into a beast, haven't you?  Anthony Wiener.  Hello!  We're the ones who broke the Anthony Wiener thing, and I gave the credit to Opie and Anthony.  Hello!  That was nice of you.  Thank you very much.  The other nice thing that I do is make sure to give Ron and Fez their proper respect 
[03:59:30]  and their proper time.  They're coming up next, so stay tuned.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow, when After Opie and Anthony Live continues.  Goodbye, everybody!  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! </pre>
