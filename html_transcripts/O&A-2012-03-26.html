<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of the Trayvon Martin shooting, focusing on the media's coverage, the "Stand Your Ground" law, and the racial implications of the public perception.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Sam Roberts, used offensive language throughout this segment and debated Geraldo Rivera's commentary on the case. They also discussed their own negative experiences with Twitter and online criticism.  A brief listener call from Eric in Philly added a perspective on police procedure in the Martin case. The discussion then briefly touched on other news stories, including an elementary school oral sex incident and the New York Jets' quarterback situation.

The next segment included E-Rock, and digressed frequently.  Main topics included Geraldo Rivera's previous appearance (Opie regretted not checking a trending clip beforehand), E-Rock's controversial tweets about Dick Cheney and Trayvon Martin resulting in lost followers, upcoming guests (Donald Sutherland, Shaquille Oâ€™Neal, Aziz Ansari, and Pauly D), Gallagher's health issues and retirement, *The Hunger Games*' success, and Mayor Bloomberg's proposed bridge tolls.  The hosts also analyzed Pat Benatar's "Love Is a Battlefield" video, discussed the legality of employers requesting Facebook passwords, and mentioned a high school student expelled for a tweet containing "fuck."  A Twisted Sister advertisement parodying *Animal House* was played.  The segment was rife with off-color and sexually suggestive jokes.

A segment focusing on James Cameron's Mariana Trench dive followed. This involved discussions of the physical and psychological challenges of the dive, the sub's descent, and speculation about what Cameron might have seen, all interspersed with crude humor, including fart jokes.  The conversation then shifted to the Titanic's decay, the possibility of raising it, recovered artifacts, and a listener call providing further details about the sub's descent.  This transitioned to Leonard Nimoy's 81st birthday, with a bizarre 1960s video of Nimoy singing a children's song being played.

Donald Sutherland then appeared in studio, entering after an amusing incident where he inadvertently bypassed the studio and gave the hosts the middle finger.  The ensuing interview covered Sutherland's career, *The Hunger Games*, his preparation for roles (emphasizing deep understanding over rote memorization), and his decision to decline violent roles like those in *Deliverance* and *Straw Dogs*. He shared anecdotes about working with Alan Alda and his son Kiefer, touched on his support of the Occupy movement and criticism of corporate tax loopholes, and discussed his decision to accept only a day's pay for *Animal House*, potentially losing millions. The hosts bantered with Sutherland, whose sarcastic wit contributed to the comedic dynamic.  After the interview, the hosts discussed their experience with Sutherland, his comedic timing, and a post-interview anecdote involving cologne and tea.  A clip of an awkward George Wendt interview was also shown.

The final segment featured an in-studio interview with George Wendt, promoting a book about beer. The interview, however, quickly turned uncomfortable as the hosts aggressively questioned Wendt's drinking habits, focusing on blackouts and vomiting. Wendt appeared visibly uncomfortable. Following the interview, the hosts discussed the awkwardness, noting Wendt's unpreparedness for this line of questioning.  The segment included listener calls, a discussion of a March Madness bracket challenge, further discussion of both the Wendt and Sutherland interviews, mentions of Danny McBride and Aziz Ansari, and the movie *The Hunger Games*. The broadcast concluded with promotional information.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Yeah!  Morning. Morning.  Good morning. Morning. Morning. Morning. Morning. Morning. Morning. Morning. Morning.  Morning. Morning. Morning.  I got a welcome aboard. I got two welcome aboards.  Two good mornings.  It was one good morning away from a full house.  Yeah. He's the bestest. Makes me feel great.  Isn't he wonderful?  Oh, he just, you know, to get that good morning like that.  Good morning. 
[00:00:30]  How's the weekend?  Ah, how could it be bad? The weekends rule.  They do rule, sir. They do.  Working for the weekend. I think that's what we're all doing.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah. Fucking Monday.  Much too short.  Let's be honest with each other.  Fucking Monday.  Please.  Doesn't matter what you do for a living.  Fucking Monday.  I think you're right.  We got it easy.  A piece of cake.  We do have it easy, but it's still fucking Monday. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  I saw the line finally.  I watched a little.  I'd never seen Office Space, so I put it on last night.  I only watched it for a half because I go to bed.  Yeah.  But I saw the line on the Monday.  Someone's going to case you the Monday's.  Case you the Monday's.  Oh, you just want to choke her.  And also, what is it you do here?  Yeah, yeah.  The John C. McKinley line.  It was funny.  That's a great movie.  He's really funny.  That's why I saw the line.  I watched it the first half hour.  Oh, you got to see the whole thing.  It's simply is it you do here.  It was very good.  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  People are beating me up on Twitter saying, oh, you said Tiger Woods would never win again.  I did not say that.  I don't know why you have to come in here on Mondays and then explain yourself to Twitter  idiots.  It's Twitter explanation.  See, at least we can go off with a lot more than 140 characters when we have to explain  things.  That's why I fuck it.  Just block everyone and keep Twitter fun for yourself and the people that might be interested  in what you're tweeting.  I said that the guy will probably win a few tournaments here and there, but I don't think  the Tiger we know and remember is ever coming back. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And if he wins a few more, then I'm completely wrong, of course.  But I didn't say he was never going to win again.  Right.  Plus the fact that it was a tournament that he's won six times prior, I believe.  So he's won this tournament seven total times now.  But he did look good.  Did he?  Yeah, he absolutely looked good.  He looked good from the start.  So I think he shot a 62 on the first day.  That's pretty fucking impressive.  That's like 10 under.  Go for Tiger.  And then he kind of kept it pretty consistent around, you know, even par or whatever for 
[00:02:30]  the rest of the tournament.  A little under.  A couple of strokes under here and there.  I did pretty good on 18.  I did a, I think it was nine under par.  Nice.  On 18.  Yeah, I saw you tweeted.  Oh, Kinect golf.  No, I know.  I saw you tweeted that shit.  Oh, yeah.  Is it accurate?  It's pretty goddamn good.  I got to say, I really like the Kinect, man.  It's, you know, I think it's the infancy of this kind of technology where you don't use  a controller or anything.  You just kind of stand there.  And it's pretty fucking cool.  And the finesse that you got to give some of the shots, it's translated in that, you know? 
[00:03:00]  So it's pretty good.  I think if you got to use actual golf clubs, then it would be really cool.  Yeah, yeah.  Because if you have nothing in your hand.  It's weird.  You almost, if you kind of grab your thumb and kind of swing, you know, it's a weird.  Because that's the one thing with golf.  You still got to get the club on the actual ball.  Yeah, yeah.  You need that feeling.  You know, and if you miss it by just a hair here or there, it will affect the shot.  But if you get to, you know, hit real golf clubs in your house, you've got to get tall 
[00:03:30]  ceilings, obviously.  Imagine the people that would have golf clubs flying through their televisions.  But that would be fucking badass.  But you think this version is pretty cool, huh?  You know, for a golf game that isn't a controller game, it's pretty fucking good.  I was playing online also.  So there's some body, some other faraway land playing with me.  And they were fucking really good.  And I kind of was like, eh, you know.  Were they cheating? 
[00:04:00]  I don't know.  You can't tell anymore if online people are cheating.  All online people cheat.  I didn't even give a shit.  If they're better than you, they're cheating.  They're cheating.  How can you cheat at golf?  That's what I tell myself.  What do you mean?  It was pretty good, though.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know how the game goes.  But certainly, you know, maybe somehow you could fucking figure out how to hit it further and shit.  I don't know how you cheat with Kinect.  I don't either.  So I'm out.  But I know.  You know, I'm sure there's cheats.  But I also like the little intermission part where, you know, you make a good hole there. 
[00:04:30]  And you get to celebrate, you know.  Yeah.  And your character is kind of standing there.  And it'll do whatever you're doing.  You know, if you throw your hands up and fist pump, it'll do that.  Yeah.  So I usually, I grab my balls and make like I'm jerking off.  All right, good.  And the character's just like jacking off on the screen.  And then, and I was doing this when I was playing online.  Right.  So the other person can see this.  Right.  And then another time, I just put my hand out in a SIG Heil and start goose-stepping around. 
[00:05:00]  Good for you.  And there's this little animated icon goose-stepping around.  Good for you.  It's fucking hilarious.  As soon as you start saying that, I'm like, the only thing you should do is jerk off.  Yeah, yeah.  You just jack off.  You should bend over and fucking just spread your ass cheeks.  Spread your ass cheeks and look over your shoulder.  Fuck you.  It's hilarious.  Fuck you.  It's hilarious.  Fuck you.  It's a lot of fun, man.  I was having fun with that game.  What is Bobo doing, Sam?  Your stupid fucking friend. 
[00:05:30]  Is that my friend?  He's fucking mad at me because I didn't say hi to him.  I didn't even see the guy.  I am dealing with all problems from now on.  I don't know.  The guy is all over Twitter.  Hope doesn't even say hi.  I didn't even see the kid.  I don't know why he's mad all the time.  He thinks he should be back on the show because the reason is because it's been a while.  The show.  All right.  So Big A hasn't been on in a while.  Stark of Patty hasn't been on in a while.  Pat from Minaki hasn't been on in a while.  That's what we told him.  But then he's all over Twitter.  Hope doesn't even say hi to me.  Did you see Bobo Friday? 
[00:06:00]  I didn't even know he was here.  I was out.  Yeah, I said hi to him.  You just had him?  I told you he was here.  I'm like, who's the head of Bobo?  I inadvertently hit the shit show on my radio.  Yeah.  Inadvertently.  Every day.  And I heard the Bobo on there.  And what happened to the Busy Buddies?  Well, Bobo joined them, I guess.  Oh, really?  I was talking and it was just rambling babble.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  But I didn't even see you, Bobo. 
[00:06:30]  So knock it off.  You don't have to explain yourself to Bobo ever.  Oh, yeah.  The Bobo.  Yeah, I know enough of him.  When you were saying explaining shit to the Twitter audience?  Yeah, yeah.  I definitely understand.  I blocked somebody.  And to think that I would block someone just on their political view and having a civil discussion about politics, race, just, you know, issues that are out there is ridiculous.  I don't do that. 
[00:07:00]  I never have done that.  But this guy got another account real quick and just starts lambasting me.  You blocked me because I don't agree with your point of view?  And I was like, no.  Because you were a fucking asshole.  I got a tweet from him.  Oh, did you?  I don't even know what the discussion had happened, but I know that that's not it.  Because then when you block, then they go to us.  I'm like, same thing.  I get that.  I'm like, well, just fucking watch your pussy boy Opie to unblock me.  And then you know what I do? 
[00:07:30]  I'm like, I don't fucking need this shit.  I'm not dealing with this shit.  I've been doing radio since I was 18.  Leave me the fuck alone, man.  Exactly.  You know?  People get blocked for being idiots.  And you do find that most of the people you block will just get another account and start all over again anyway.  Yeah.  I know for a fact one guy that has started over a dozen accounts.  Really?  That's how obsessed he is.  That's fucking, you know.  Yeah, that's bordering on psychopaths.  Oh, of course.  And we all have them.  Jesus.  We all have them.  We all have a few of those. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Getting into, especially over the weekend, a lot of Trayvon.  Trayvon.  A lot of Trayvon tweets.  We get the young man that was gunned down in Florida.  So there were a lot of those tweets.  And I was just, I was trying to let people in on some facts.  Not so much about the case, but things that people don't really understand about use of deadly physical force laws. 
[00:08:30]  Because people are like, he was unarmed.  Now, again, I've said this many times.  I'm not saying anything about what happened, what didn't happen, because no one knows yet.  You know, they've got to go through this whole thing and do an investigation, which they're doing right now under a microscope.  But a lot of people are like, they have no idea that someone could be unarmed and still be shot by somebody justifiably.  It can happen.  It's not out of the ordinary.  And if a 911 operator suggests to you to not follow somebody, it's that, a suggestion. 
[00:09:00]  It's not the law.  And then if you follow them, you're breaking some kind of law.  Like, a lot of people are piling these things on.  Like, you know, he did so many wrong things in that situation that resulted in this guy dying.  But the fact of the matter is, a lot of people don't know what the laws are.  Why are you telling me?  You've got to tell LeBron James.  Well.  And the Miami Heat.  I see.  You're wearing your hoodie.  Everybody's got the hoodies on today.  We're all wearing our hoodies. 
[00:09:30]  Well, Sam is.  Sam, are you, wait a minute.  I've got to ask you, honestly.  Did you do that on purpose?  No, he wears a hoodie almost every day.  I didn't notice until I saw you.  Sam doesn't get political.  This wasn't on purpose.  You're not wearing one in solidarity of Trevon?  You know, I actually, stupid winter decided to come back.  Yeah, a little bit.  So my winter coat usually has a hood.  I took, I actually took the hood off today.  You took your hood off.  You took the hood off.  I didn't mean to.  But I'm like, it's kind of, you know, I don't need the hood with the whole fucking ensemble. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So I took, I actually took my hoodie off today.  Uh, yeah, the wearing of the hoodie, the, I saw a bunch of, it looked like kindergarten  kids all lined up wearing hoodies and holding Skittles because he apparently had Skittles  and iced tea with them.  So, so did Trevon have a hoodie on, obviously?  Uh, yeah.  Was it pulled up?  Uh, yeah.  He had a pulled up hoodie and, uh, he was, uh, walking through this neighborhood, which  they call a gated community.  Um, it's, it's apartment buildings with a gate around.  Um, it's not quite the rolling lush hills of a gated community, but the press. 
[00:10:30]  Is it, hold on though.  Is it, is there only one way in?  Um, no.  Because that's a gated community.  There's a way in off a few different streets.  A few different, like.  But is there like a guard at each entrance?  Yeah, I think it's just gated.  Then why are they calling it a gated community?  Because they want, the press wants this to sound white.  They want it to sound more menacing.  They want it to sound like it was a white man in a gated, plush community that shot a  innocent black man.  Well, that's why, that's why I'm slowing you down.  Because a true gated community, they, they're on guard all the time. 
[00:11:00]  It's usually one, maybe two ways to get in.  And those areas are guarded, obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  But you're saying this is not the case here.  No, it's, it's, there's a gate around apartment buildings is what it is.  Which, again, doesn't make any difference in what happened.  Right.  I'm not saying it justifies anything.  I'm not saying anything about that.  The actual incident, when I say that, I'm just saying that the press, this is an incident  where the press is jumping on it and trying to make it something it isn't, because it 
[00:11:30]  makes a better story if a white man, and especially if it was an affluent, gated community  living white man, killed an innocent black man.  And he's Hispanic, the guy, his family's identified Zimmerman as Hispanic.  Zimmerman is Hispanic, but Reuters continues to call him a white Hispanic, which...  Like a president, they call a white black man, I guess.  A white black man, right, right.  Because he's half white.  The press just sucks.  It really is insane what the press has done here. 
[00:12:00]  I look at that guy, I think Hispanic every time.  I don't think white Hispanic.  What is white Hispanic?  It just, they want to put the word white in there so bad.  Desperately.  Of course.  So bad.  But do you know, I've allowed myself, and I caught myself doing this, getting annoyed  at this case, and I'm allowing my hatred of the press.  Yep.  Hatred.  To like, to look at this and go, well, like, it was a bad shooting.  But I'm almost allowing my hatred of the press to taint looking at this for what it was, 
[00:12:30]  which was a guy who was a douche.  The guy, look, man, I heard the tape.  He didn't have to follow that dude.  Because it's not his property.  He's a fucking security guy.  His life wasn't threatened.  You could hear the kid in another tape yelling, help, help.  Well, now they're saying that might not be him.  I believe it was him.  It could be Zimmerman, because some witnesses are coming forward, or a witness is coming  forward and saying that he was getting beaten by Trayvon, and that's him yelling on the  tape.  They'll be able to figure that out eventually. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Zimmerman allegedly had a broken nose, all kinds of bruises on his face, and the back  of his head was cut open from where he was thrown on the ground and being punched by  Trayvon.  How old was Zimmerman?  28.  28.  Trayvon was 17.  And then they're trying to show that there is some kind of penchant for violent behavior,  because Trayvon was suspended for 10 days from school, and it's being floated out there 
[00:13:30]  that he was suspended for beating up a bus driver.  But now this case, if it turns out Zimmerman didn't do anything wrong, there'll be riots  in Miami, like we can't get justice, and it's not, without, because maybe, by person, I thought  it was a bad shooting, but maybe if he was getting beaten up, maybe.  I know, that's just it.  And that's the reason that he has not been arrested as of yet, is because all of the  evidence on the scene that the police have to act on showed it as a self-defense shooting, 
[00:14:00]  and they took down the report as that.  They took witnesses, from witnesses, and the scene, they determined it was a self-defense  shooting, and they didn't arrest him.  Now, it will go to a grand jury, I think, April 10th, they're going to start hearing this  case, and like Jimmy said, if, in fact, evidence that isn't, hasn't been heard yet, shows that  this was a self-defense shooting, and in Florida, with the, you don't have to retreat from aggression 
[00:14:30]  in Florida in order to use deadly physical force.  It's not a prerequisite to that.  You, if it's shown to be a good shooting, wow, there is going to be some shit.  Jeb Bush came out and said it was, the Stand Your Ground did not count here.  Was that him just trying to?  Oh, yeah, because he doesn't look too good right now.  He's trying to smooth this over.  The Stand Your Ground law is, it's perfectly fine.  It really is a good law. 
[00:15:00]  It doesn't, it leaves you not open to these lawsuits if you do have to use deadly physical  force.  Did you hear him say fucking Coons into the mic?  Like, that's, like, of course CNN harped on that.  We got it right here.  You got the tape?  We got it right here.  When you hear it over and over, at first I didn't think it, and then when I heard it  played a couple of times, cleaned up, you know, like, I've allowed, I have the obsession  with, if it was in reverse, it wouldn't be reported this way. 
[00:15:30]  I'm trying not to.  Well, Zimmerman's lawyer is saying that he was saying goons, and that's what he would call  thugs, or people that are, you know, suspicious.  Wow.  He's acknowledging goons.  I don't know.  The lawyer, you know, is trying to put on fire.  Who's got their pink hoodie on?  Look at all these hoodies.  Hoodies all over the place.  Oh, God.  Which entrance is that that he's heading towards?  The back entrance. 
[00:16:00]  Are you following him?  Yeah.  Okay, we don't need you to do that.  In my honest opinion, that's coons.  I think he's a fucking coons.  That doesn't sound like coons.  In my honest opinion, that's coons.  Which entrance is that that he's heading towards?  The back entrance.  Fucking coons.  Are you following him?  Oh, that is so coons.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Fucking coons.  Yeah, that does.  I mean, that does.  But that's, to me, a case.  I don't want my hatred of the media to interfere with.  Like, that's a case where it actually does matter what he said, because you could see 
[00:16:30]  that that's part of the motive, maybe.  Following the guy.  If you're a neighborhood watch guy, your job is not to follow a guy.  No, no.  You call the police.  With a fucking pistol.  And how do you get...  Here's what I find hard to believe, not knowing all the facts.  Uh-huh.  You're following a guy with a pistol.  He's unarmed.  When you pull a pistol, he has Skittles, and he attacks you.  I'm not saying it couldn't happen.  He apparently did not pull the pistol.  Oh, okay.  Until he felt his life was being threatened.  And some of these witnesses are alleging that when Trayvon was on top of him and punching 
[00:17:00]  him, he pulled the pistol out then and shot him.  That phone call to the girlfriend is disturbing, though.  Like, they're saying, like, the call from the Trayvon made to his chick and was telling,  like, this guy's staring at me.  Now he's looking at me.  Like, he was bothered, but it didn't sound like he was menacing this guy.  Why would you call your chick in the middle of fucking menacing?  Yeah, yeah.  That just doesn't make sense to me.  Well, all this stuff has to come out in an investigation. 
[00:17:30]  It's...  There is an investigation ongoing.  It's under a microscope.  So people that are screaming for justice, it's...  The wheels are in motion.  We'll see what happens.  Yeah.  Why was Trayvon walking through the gated community?  The quote gated community.  His father was visiting his girlfriend.  His father has a girlfriend in that community.  Trayvon, because he was suspended from school, didn't have to be in his neck of the woods where  he lived, and he was going to hang out with his father and his father's girlfriend at  this complex. 
[00:18:00]  So he went there.  He was hanging out with them.  He went to go get some skittles and iced tea, and that's when he was coming back and  met up with Jorge Zimmerman.  It leads to Geraldo Rivera.  Geraldo's own son hates him right now.  Geraldo is a douche.  And I know what he's saying, too, but I just think he's wrong.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Geraldo, again, is motivated by his own interests. 
[00:18:30]  He's very pro-Hispanic, being Hispanic himself.  He's been on our show, and I think when Jimmy brought up something that was questioning something  he said about Hispanics, he pretty much just lost his mind.  We got into it because I said something like, I'm happy with people.  I don't want the borders closed.  I just want people to come here legally and attempt to assimilate into the culture and  learn the language.  I don't think that's too much to ask, but I wasn't saying get rid of them, don't let  them come in.  You're welcome to come.  It was too much to ask for Geraldo.  Geraldo was out of his mind. 
[00:19:00]  He's like, no, they're learning English faster than anything.  And then me and Opio walk at home.  After the interview, we're walking home.  We look in a building.  They're doing, in Opio's building on the other side, they're setting up a mock apartment  for another building.  So I'm like, which building is this?  We couldn't even talk to the guys.  They couldn't even answer what building they were fucking doing.  A very simple question.  A mock-up for.  Before we play the Geraldo Rivera, we got Eric in Philly.  Eric disagrees with Anthony.  Eric, what's up, buddy? 
[00:19:30]  I didn't see anything to disagree with.  Anthony, I agree with you 99.9% of the time, but in this instance, it's not about rage.  It's about shoddy police work.  It explains to me how they could drug test the victim, but not drug test the shooter.  What would have given them the right, by the way, to drug test the shooter?  There is no law that says that...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  There's no law that says a shooter has to be drug tested.  Is there a law that the victim has to be drug tested? 
[00:20:00]  I don't know.  The point is, the kid wants to...  I know, I know, I know, though...  He wasn't out there wielding a gun for no good reason.  If he didn't track the kid, he wouldn't be in the situation he's in.  It doesn't...  It doesn't matter.  I mean, he was following the kid, and his contention was that he was doing that as part of the neighborhood watch.  If no shooting happened, this just would have been a, you know, he followed some kid, called the police, they checked him out, whatever. 
[00:20:30]  But in a fluid situation like that, the use of deadly physical force is...  It goes back and forth, depending on every second of what is happening in that situation.  You can use deadly physical force, and then within a second, the situation can change, and you're not justified in using deadly physical force.  That's how, you know, odd it is, and how difficult it is to say if a shooting is good or not. 
[00:21:00]  Agreed, but this kid is an overzealous scumbag who was overstepping his boundaries as a citizen.  Oh, I agree with that.  So what don't you agree with me on, though?  Because I didn't say anything...  Shoddy police work, are you saying?  And I agree with you 99.999% of the time, my man.  Shoot, I had a lot of people saying, you know, when a police shoots somebody, they put them on administrative leave, they put them on a desk until the investigation is done.  Sometimes they take their gun away.  Police are held to a higher standard than citizens are, to tell you the truth. 
[00:21:30]  But they're not arrested.  That's what it is.  A cop is not arrested, so maybe you're not arresting this guy is the right move.  But that is a good point about them drug testing the victim.  Like, maybe they shouldn't drug test the shooter, but why do you drug test the victim unless that's standard and I didn't know it?  I have no idea.  It might be standard in some type of situation like that.  I don't know.  But I do know that unless this guy is arrested and for some reason they deemed he was intoxicated or on drugs, perhaps, if they looked at him, cops are pretty good at spotting people that are on drugs or alcohol. 
[00:22:00]  I guess they didn't have a reason to drug test or alcohol test this guy.  And what picture are they showing these days of Trayvon?  Well, I hear they're showing more of an older picture of him.  Well, they've been showing the young picture, but they've also shown George Zimmerman in a previous arrest picture in an orange jumpsuit when, in fact, there are plenty of pictures of him looking, you know, smiling, looking very nice. 
[00:22:30]  I like to point it out on both sides.  It is.  It's the press.  They love fucking shaping this story.  Yeah.  Is that how Trayvon Martin looked when he got shot?  No, no.  That's a picture when he was, like, 12 years old.  So why do they keep showing him as a young, innocent kid?  It's a lot.  It makes the story better.  It does sell papers.  So what does he look like now?  More like that.  Nice.  You guys happen to recognize that Zimmerman kid looks like Chaz Bono?  Maybe that's why he was so pissed off.  He really does.  Good job, Eric. 
[00:23:00]  Look at the picture of him in the orange jumpsuit.  And what Obama said, by the way, fuck Newt Gingham, because what Obama said was if I had a son, he would look like that.  He's not saying he's black and I'm black.  Like, he's trying to personalize, like, God, that could have been my kid that was injured like that.  I don't find that to be offensive.  And Newt Gingrich comes out and goes, well, that's despicable.  It's divisive.  Fuck Newt.  Newt Gingrich really annoys me.  I was mad at Obama when he first said that, but then when I looked at Trayvon Martin and studied it, I'm like, holy fuck, he kind of does look like he could be Obama's actual son. 
[00:23:30]  But you can't win as the president when you comment on that.  Like, if he would have commented, if he's just trying to personalize it and saying, I can kind of empathize with these parents because I have kids.  A lot of people saying it was a powerful statement by the president.  It did have, you know, race beyond it.  It wasn't like, if it was a white kid, he wouldn't have said that.  No, but if it was a white president, it was a white kid.  I'm not saying that he didn't say that the kid would have looked like his kid, but maybe he's empathizing as a parent.  Like, look, this could be my son or my.  Is he going to say that about the, about the University of Mississippi white kid that was shot and killed by three black guys yesterday? 
[00:24:00]  Is he?  Oh, that's right.  No, we haven't heard about that.  What happened?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  University of Mississippi.  You can always count on that.  It's got the.  Good for it.  It's got the info.  Shot dead by three black guys who got away in a car.  For what reason?  Why was he shot dead?  Who knows?  No one knows.  No one knows.  No one knows.  We know it wasn't racial.  Oh, couldn't have been.  We know it wasn't a racially motivated.  Couldn't have been.  Couldn't have been racial.  And this, when I hear this stuff, this is the stuff I'm allowing to poison my view of this Trayvon Martin thing. 
[00:24:30]  And I caught myself doing it.  And it's like, from what I've heard and from what I believe so far, it really seems like this kid was innocent and walking home.  And you can't penalize someone for having a thug look because when I was growing up, the hoodie look wasn't it.  It was fucking long hair and metal.  And it was when rap first started.  So it was like, when I was a kid, if someone had a fucking long hair, it looked like Florentine in 1990.  All of a sudden, everyone's wearing hoodies. 
[00:25:00]  When I bring up the pictures, when I bring up the Trayvon pictures on Twitter and Life on the Compound, which is on iTunes right now.  I did a whole little thing on Trayvon if you want to see it.  Just search Compound on iTunes.  When I bring up the pictures, though, because there are new pictures of him from his Facebook page that show him flipping the bird with his hoodie up and like all gangsters, pants are down by his fucking middle of his thighs.  But I'm not bringing it up to say that it justifies anything that happened to this guy or that that's anything. 
[00:25:30]  But I want to bring it up because the news will never show that.  They just won't show you that photo.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't they show all the pictures?  I don't know.  We're looking at three right now.  And they obviously go to the most innocent one.  Yeah, because they really are pigs.  They love shaping the story.  Like you said earlier, it sells more fucking newspapers.  It keeps you glued or sells ratings is what we really should say.  It keeps black people angry. 
[00:26:00]  It keeps white people feeling scared and guilty.  And it keeps everybody fucking watching and buying.  Another story that was in the news over the weekend was, I think it was in Alabama or maybe Louisiana, one of these southern Gulf type states.  In a school, a couple of, I think they were eight-year-olds, were they, having oral sex with each other under a desk.  Nice.  And the teacher was fired because the teacher apparently didn't notice.  How do you not notice?  That you're eight-year-olds in a class under the desk, oral sex with each other. 
[00:26:30]  Isn't every eight-year-old looking at that?  Who knows?  But the teacher apparently didn't give a flying fuck or just was so not doing their job that they weren't even paying attention to what's going on in the classroom.  You should be fired for that, by the way.  Well, the, the, I mean, really, a few news organizations used file photos of a child at a desk and the child was a white child when, in fact, these were two black kids that were having oral sex under the desk in a 85% black area and school district. 
[00:27:00]  What is wrong with the media?  But using a white file photo in that circumstance was misleading.  Yep.  And I don't think it was the right thing to do.  I think it's another way that the press goes, meh, well, it's not.  You got proof of this?  I want to see this for myself.  Maybe they also feel like it's more tragic, though.  Like, again, we talked about they don't fucking show black missing kids the way they show white missing. 
[00:27:30]  Don't forget, they're white and they are, at the end of the day, fucking feeling a lot better than the people that they're making to look like victims.  So for them, it's probably more of a tragic story, a shocking story, if the white kids are having oral sex than the black kids.  So they want to do it that way and make it look more shocking.  Like, isn't this terrible?  These children were being unmonitored and if it's black kids, they probably feel like, well, of course, that's what black kids do.  Well, this whole thing with Trayvon Martin is just bringing up a lot of racial stories. 
[00:28:00]  And what I'm seeing is a lot of attention on this case.  Right.  And I'm seeing a bigger problem that isn't being attended to, which is black-on-black crime.  The fact that I said last weekend 10 people were killed in Chicago shootings, that is getting no attention.  40 people were shot and 10 killed.  That's a war zone.  That's a fucking war zone.  But, you know, they'd rather concentrate on white Hispanic guy shoots... 
[00:28:30]  White Hispanic guy.  The media can't get enough of that.  Where are all the shootings, though?  Are they in those areas where we've pretty much given up on those areas?  Gang, gang, gang.  As a society.  But you know what?  There are no less innocent people that are being killed in these circumstances, because it's not always the gang or the drug dealer that's being killed in these shootings.  It's a 6-year-old girl was killed in the shooting.  A 10-year-old was wounded. 
[00:29:00]  And you know what?  What makes her any less innocent, because she was shot by another black guy, and you could just chalk it up to drugs and gang violence, instead of some half-white Hispanic security guy?  Well, you got Reverend Al talking about blueberry pies.  That's why.  And they had the blueberry pie!  It's on TV again.  I know.  These lean-forward ads.  They're rough.  MSNBC.  They are rough to watch. 
[00:29:30]  Fuck their mothers.  They are fucking rough.  I can't stand them.  They just...  They're infuriating.  I don't know what they're trying to do with those ads, either.  The lean-forward?  You're so far left with those ads.  It's insane.  They are simply trying to almost own what they are.  Wow.  Because Fox is destroying everyone.  Yeah.  They're probably just trying to go, okay, here's what we are.  Come here if you like this thinking.  The Ed Schultz one really bothers me now.  We were seeing it before the show.  And we were saying that I would love to see Ed Schultz's conversation with his tax guy. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  After he's on TV talking about how, you know, people aren't paying their fair share and they're  getting away with murder and this and that.  I would love to fucking listen to that conversation.  Sitting with his accountant.  Do you think he's going, please, just give him more.  Right.  Give him more.  Or do you think he's going, all right, here's some receipts.  What could you scratch off my taxable income here?  Jesus Christ, they're killing me.  What could you work up for me?  Please.  Yeah.  Just stop it.  It's all bullshit in the end.  Everyone just bullshits their way through life. 
[00:30:30]  Of course they do.  Here's Geraldo.  Geraldo's just a fucking dope.  Let's talk about the Trevon Martin case and what's going on in Florida.  Well, I have a different take, Brian, on that.  I believe that George Zimmerman, the overzealous neighborhood watch captain, should be investigated  to the fullest extent of the law.  And if he is criminally liable, he should be prosecuted.  And he will be.  That's fair.  And that's a fair statement.  That's all.  So far so good, Geraldo.  And that's all I've been saying the entire weekend. 
[00:31:00]  And I have been called horrifically awful things on Twitter by people.  But all I'm saying is no one has the information that the people that are conducting the investigation have.  So far so good.  And it's under a microscope.  There's no shenanigans going to be pulled on this investigation because everyone's watching now.  But I am urging the parents of black and Latino youngsters particularly to not let their children go out wearing hoodies. 
[00:31:30]  I think the hoodie is as much responsible for Trevon Martin's death as George Zimmerman was.  When you see a kid walking, Julia, when you see a kid walking down the street, particularly a dark-skinned kid like my son Cruz,  who I constantly yelled at when he was going out wearing a damn hoodie or those pants around his ankles,  take that hood off.  People look at you and what do they think?  What's the instant identification?  What's the instant association?  It's those crime scenes, surveillance tapes. 
[00:32:00]  Every time you see someone sticking up a 7-Eleven, the kid's wearing a hoodie.  Every time you see a mugging on a surveillance camera or they get the old lady in the alcove, it's a kid wearing a hoodie.  You have to recognize that this whole stylizing yourself as a gangster, you're going to be a gangster wannabe.  Well, people are going to perceive you as a menace.  That's what happens.  It is an instant reflexive action.  Look, not the worst thing in the world when he just said this.  Hearing him say it completely is not crazy at all.  He's right.  I don't know if that's what happened here in this case. 
[00:32:30]  But he's not crazy for what he's saying right there.  Right or wrong, it's what it is.  You know, you can't say that Geraldo's wrong.  No, he's not.  Because when you do look at surveillance video, you do see a lot of hoodies with guns pointing at people.  There happens to be a person underneath the hoodie.  Saying the hoodie's as guilty as Zimmerman is stupid.  No, that's dumb.  But, I mean, are kids walking around with the hoodie all tight? 
[00:33:00]  The hoodie up and tight?  I don't know the style of hoodie, Sam.  Well, what is Geraldo saying there?  Just walking out of the house with a hoodie on?  Well, the whole thing.  Because that's dumb because across the board people are wearing a hoodie.  No, if you just walk out of the house with a hoodie on.  But if you're, you know, like you said, the pants are pulled down on your ass and you're fucking, you got the hoodie up and you're just barely looking out from underneath it.  Right.  You know, there's, there's, there's, that's all menacing.  Everyone knows what the look is.  Let's not fucking, you know, semantics come into play here. 
[00:33:30]  Let's not fucking bullshit each other here.  We know what the look is.  It's a gangster thug look that when you see somebody walking toward you on maybe an empty street like that, you might have some concern is what I'm saying.  But it doesn't justify anything.  If that guy had walked up to him in the booth and started a fight with him and he shot him, I would say fuck Trayvon Martin.  But it doesn't look like that's what happened.  Even though he had the hoodie on, to me, the things that bug me are the fact that he followed him, which it's hard to justify physical force. 
[00:34:00]  He's a cop, but he's not a cop.  He's a neighborhood watch guy whose job is to take a look, call the fucking police, and he did call the police.  He called the cops.  Then he should have just let the cops do their work.  Or, but if this kid would have just disappeared or the cops didn't get him or he would have broken into a house before the cops got there.  Like, before the shooting, it doesn't seem like that bad a thing to do, is what I'm saying. 
[00:34:30]  Following someone that you don't recognize in the neighborhood that you're the neighborhood watch guy.  I mean, so following somebody isn't in and of itself a bad thing pre-shooting.  Was Trayvon wearing a hoodie?  Yeah.  All tight and shit or just fucking?  Oh, yeah, that's why everyone's wearing a hoodie, because that's all he had was a hoodie on and some skills.  But, I mean, was he wearing it the way Geraldo's saying?  That's important here.  I don't know how he was wearing the hoodie.  It is Florida.  It's tough to walk around with the hood up and tight. 
[00:35:00]  Was it raining?  Oh, are you kidding?  Come on.  I see people in July wearing snorkel jackets around the city.  Please.  I'm just saying, you know.  I mean, that's a big, that's a, there is a difference there.  I don't think he was wearing it softly off the shoulders.  You don't think?  No.  You think he had it up?  Yeah, it was probably up.  But I don't know.  I'm just saying.  Geraldo continues here.  Remember Juan Williams, our colleague, our brilliant colleague.  He got in trouble with NPR because he said Muslims in formal garb at the airport conjure a certain reaction in him, a response in him. 
[00:35:30]  That's an automatic reflex.  Juan wasn't defending it.  He was explaining that that's what happened when he sees these particular people in that particular place.  When you see a black or a Latino youngster, particularly on the street, you walk to the other side of the street.  You try to avoid that confrontation.  Trayvon Morton's, you know, God bless him.  He's an innocent kid, a wonderful kid, a box of Skittles in his hand.  He didn't deserve to die.  But I'll bet you money.  If he didn't have that hoodie on, that nutty neighborhood watch guy wouldn't have responded in that violent and aggressive way. 
[00:36:00]  God, I don't hate what Geraldo's saying.  I don't fucking hate it.  Except for the line.  Everyone went nuts about this.  Except for the line about the hoodie being as responsible as everyone.  That was a dumb line.  That's dumb, yeah.  But in general, I don't hate what Geraldo's saying here.  Nope.  It's hard.  If there wasn't a shooting, if this was a case of this guy just confronting Trayvon Martin and then having like a confrontational moment,  and then that would be, to me, totally justifiable. 
[00:36:30]  And by the way, this is why it's so hard for people on TV to be honest.  Yeah.  Because they attack.  They just attack you.  And they didn't quote him accurately.  This is Geraldo being honest.  Yeah.  And then we get mad if people are being honest, right?  And they didn't quote him accurately, and they didn't quote his intent.  Because you listen to that, he's certainly not a racist.  I don't fucking hate what Geraldo's saying.  And that's probably not the smartest thing to say today, because everyone's all about hoods up and it's hoodie day and all that.  Oh, yeah.  But he raised that one, what's that guy's name?  One.  Because I think he's generalizing here, obviously. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  And he's not necessarily completely talking about Trayvon.  Right.  He's generalizing.  Or Juan Williams, who got fired for NPR.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's quoting him as saying that certain looks.  But people do wear certain things sometimes because they want to appear a certain way.  And if you react to that appearance, you're a blankophobe or a blankist.  Got it, yeah.  Instead of realizing, well, they dress a certain way because they want you to feel that way.  And a show we all love, The Wire.  Man, when they wanted those guys to look menacing, what did they do? 
[00:37:30]  There's a way to dress someone.  They put their hoods up.  Right.  And went tight.  There's a way to dress.  You know, I dress like a gangster every so often.  You sure do that.  You sure do.  I get hassled.  But when I do it, it's the pinstripe suit with a fedora.  Because I dress like an oldie style gangster.  Get it, Jim?  I did not, but I'd like you to explain it further.  Wouldn't that be hilarious if I just walked around like Edward G. Robinson?  By the way, the other Trayvon Martin pictures aren't even that menacing. 
[00:38:00]  No, no.  They're certainly different than the ones the media are showing.  He gots a grill, motherfucker.  They're trying to find like a, you know, really menacing bad picture.  What bothers me is I really thought Trayvon Martin was a lot younger because I'm not as  close to the story as Anthony is.  Oh, I follow all racial stories.  But I've been watching on TV and I'm like, oh, poor young kid.  But it's like, holy fuck, that picture they're using is a good two or three years old.  Yeah.  Why are they doing that?  Yeah, I don't know.  Some of them are five years old. 
[00:38:30]  Why'd they do it with the guy that was beaten up by Fat Nick?  They just kept showing him in military garb.  Like, look at the picture.  They keep showing.  They keep showing him when he's 12.  That's okay.  In front of a flag.  Instead of realizing he was in a neighborhood to steal cars.  It's because they, again, it comes back to that thing.  What is it?  It doesn't.  What does this serve them?  What purpose does this serve the people doing this?  There is a reason for it.  Well, it gets you more interested in the story.  But it goes even deeper than that.  Because they're all looking for ratings, man.  They believe it.  When you listen to them talk, they really believe it. 
[00:39:00]  By the way, I still don't believe Trayvon Martin deserved what he got.  Not at all.  No.  But it's so weird how the media likes to shape it their own way.  And then we have to look at them and think that they're giving us actual news.  Accurate news?  Get the fuck out of here.  Until they do a complete investigation on this, I'm not judging either way.  Like, I'm not fucking judging anything.  I don't know what happened.  And neither does all these other people that are tweeting.  I'm just saying what could be if the laws are adhered to. 
[00:39:30]  And what, you know, like I said, the use of deadly physical force has no bearing if somebody's armed or not.  Or has Skittles and iced tea instead of a gun.  Or, you know, a hoodie who gives a shit about the hoodie that, you know, if somebody perceives a threat to their life and it's judged that he was, had reasonable belief that his life is in danger, then, yeah.  You're allowed to use deadly physical force to protect yourself. 
[00:40:00]  All right.  One more clip from Geraldo.  What about the fact, I mean, the people of New York, a couple of nights ago, they had a million hoodie marks.  You cannot rehabilitate the hoodie.  You're not going to, I understand that the reaction might be overzealous or even irrational in some extent.  I mean, when you look at the statistics, it may be.  But you're not going to rehabilitate the hoodie.  You're not going to.  Just stop wearing it.  Stop wearing it.  Don't let your kid, you know, the old Johnny Cash song, don't take your gun to town, son, leave your gun at home. 
[00:40:30]  There is some things that are almost inevitable.  I'm not suggesting that Trayvon Morton had any kind of weapon or anything, but he wore an outfit that allowed someone to respond in this irrational, overzealous way.  And if he had been dressed more appropriately, I think unless it's raining out or you're at a track meet, leave the hoodie home.  Don't let your children wear it.  I thought I remembered, you know what?  It was raining.  He was wearing a hoodie and it was up because it was raining.  Bravo to Geraldo.  But Geraldo said something like he contradicted himself. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  I know, but I'm guilty because I saw Geraldo on Twitter, you know, trending and all that.  I'm like, what an idiot.  And I'm guilty of not going and listening to the clips myself until today.  I don't have much of a problem with what he's saying.  I really don't.  Yeah, I think if you're going to...  When we were growing up, our parents yelled at us all the time.  You're not going to leave the house looking like that for whatever reason, right?  I looked like a dirty pothead when I was in school.  I used to wear the green army type top and a hat and, oh, see, I'm still wearing that. 
[00:41:30]  I didn't even catch that.  Look, you know, Zimmerman fucking blew it.  It was raining, too, so he had to...  But Geraldo said that the hoodies is responsible as Zimmerman.  And then he goes, unless it's raining, but it was raining.  So it's like that contradicts the most...  But I sort of understand that, too, because when you're walking around and it's raining  and you see a bunch of people with their hoods up, you're not thinking as much as if the hoods are up 
[00:42:00]  and it's a beautiful sunny day.  So I sort of get it.  But everybody is jumping on the...  Logically, you would think that shit out in your own head.  Everyone's jumping on the, you know, prefacing this and finishing off what you say by saying,  hey, look, I think Zimmerman, you know, did this or that.  We don't know.  You can't...  Everyone's rushing to judgment.  God, I don't...  It's one of these deals where you got to wait and see.  This guy may have literally thought his life was in danger at that point. 
[00:42:30]  Who knows?  Between the time when he followed...  Following him, it doesn't come into play during that moment of he felt his life was in danger.  If he feels his life is in danger, then it would be a justifiable shooting.  But in a situation where we all have interactions and we all understand certain subtleties and interactions,  a guy who knows he's armed who's following a dude, to me, that's a wannabe cop. 
[00:43:00]  He's one of those guys.  So it's almost like if you're putting yourself in a situation where you're hoping something happens,  even if you don't realize you're doing that, where you can pull the pistol, here's a shot to do it.  Maybe they had some words.  I don't know.  But I would have a lot more fucking empathy for Zimmerman if this kid had walked up to him,  or this guy had walked up to him, and they had had something.  But why would this guy call his fucking girlfriend? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Can you look that up real quick before we go to the girlfriend thing?  Because he did call his girlfriend.  His girlfriend heard some of it, and she was like, just run.  Just run.  Just run.  She said that to her boyfriend, like, get the fuck out of there.  Like, I don't know.  Why would that interaction?  That's not a...  When's the last time you heard a blood or a crip call his girlfriend and go,  there's a man with a gun, and she went, run?  Yeah, true.  That's not a gangster thing to do.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure that'll come into play as far as the grand jury goes.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, that kind of fucking...  That kind of bugs me. 
[00:44:00]  And, hey, look, maybe they did have a fight, and maybe the help wasn't Zimmerman.  I mean, sorry, it wasn't Trayvon, but...  I don't know.  Help.  Help.  If you're on the phone with your chick, and she's saying, run, and then there's somebody  yelling, help, and he's mumbling fucking coons as he's following you with a pistol, those  things so far make it hard for me to see where...  I see.  I agree with you, Jimmy.  But, again, I don't know.  I mean, what would you say, Sam?  Still early in the whole investigation.  He said, and this is according to his girlfriend, the phone was in his pocket, and the earphone 
[00:44:30]  was in his ear.  Uh, he said this man was watching him, so he put his hoodie on.  Uh, he said he lost the man, Martin's friend said.  Is that the chick or a girl?  Yeah.  I asked Trayvon to run, and he said he was going to walk fast.  I told him to run, but said he was not going to run.  Eventually, he would run, said the girl, thinking that he managed to escape.  But suddenly, the strange man was back cornering him.  And Trayvon said, what are you following me for?  And the man said, what are you doing here?  Next thing I hear is somebody pushing, and somebody pushed Trayvon because the headset 
[00:45:00]  just fell.  Now, that could have been Trayvon pushing him.  Who knows?  I called him again, and he didn't answer the phone.  The line went dead.  Besides screams heard on 9-1-1 that night, as Martin Zimmerman scuffled, those were the  last words he said.  So they don't know who...  So maybe he didn't have the hoodie on when he started following him.  And then he put the hoodie on for whatever reason.  Maybe he was trying to make himself look tougher.  I mean, who knows?  Maybe he didn't know it was a neighborhood watch guy, and you're trying to make yourself 
[00:45:30]  look tough.  Because sometimes you want to look a little bit tougher because you're scared, too.  Just because he's a black kid doesn't mean he's not scared of getting a ship beat out  of an apartment complex.  So maybe some fucking guy who looks kind of menacing himself is following him.  He's like, what the fuck?  Yeah, you could speculate all kinds of scenarios here, what happened before the shooting.  But if he called that chick, that to me is not the sign of a guy who runs and goes, I lost 
[00:46:00]  him.  Did he call the girl or did she call him?  Or were they on the phone when this all went down?  It sounds to me like he didn't call his chick when this happened.  It sounds like he was talking to his chick and then this confrontation happened and she  happened to catch what was going on.  Maybe, but that sounds to me, if he says to her like, hey, this guy is looking at me  and she's like, get out of there.  And he's like, I'm not going to run.  Those just aren't even responses to somebody who's about to be confrontational, saying I'm 
[00:46:30]  going to walk fast, but I'm not going to run.  Well, perhaps he wasn't thinking about being confrontational until this guy's like, hey,  what are you doing here?  And then he thinks, why the fuck is this asshole asking me anything?  Fuck you.  And then, you know, lunges at him.  You could speculate both ways.  You know, it's just one of those things.  Maybe, yeah.  And I'm not saying that's what happened either.  God, are they in a tough spot down there in Florida?  Oh, boy.  They are in a tough spot.  They're hoping, boy. 
[00:47:00]  They're hoping, fucking Coons is a rough one, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Because that shows a certain mindset walking into it.  Like, that's an aggressive thing.  Why would you say that on a 911 call, you dumb motherfucker?  Well, that's just it.  And, well, also, a lot of his friends that are black are coming forward and saying, this  guy is great.  We love him.  He's never been a racist.  He's, you know, and some very respected people.  For Zimmerman?  Yeah, for Zimmerman.  There's a former news guy from down in Florida that was well-respected and is a friend with 
[00:47:30]  Zimmerman and said, no, this guy, he's not racist at all.  He was mentoring, him and his wife, I guess, were mentoring two black kids for free.  So, this whole racist thing that's coming out is a lot of people saying, no, he wasn't  racist.  Race didn't play any part in it.  This is a rough situation.  But this is where the media, if it turns out they're wrong, where they should just be fucking  lined up and shot in the temple because they put you in a bad place.  Like, everybody is ready to fucking go out and riot now. 
[00:48:00]  So, and like, what if they really didn't get all the facts out right?  The news is inciting.  They, if they're, if, if this happens, if, if he's found to be justified in his shooting  in self-defense and the grand jury says we're not going to indict and there are any type  of violence or riots, the fucking news is, was inciting a riot.  But then again, they'll cover it. 
[00:48:30]  They'll cover it with, with fucking foam coming out of their mouths.  Oh, well, they love a good race riot.  I wonder if they, if they cover it that way much more because it does incite certain, maybe  those things are much more reactionary than black on white.  White on black just gets a reaction out of blacks, a lot more of a violent reaction than  black on white would get from whites.  And that's just better for them to cover.  I don't know.  Maybe there's something, maybe there's something really scummy about it.  Thousands to march for Trayvon. 
[00:49:00]  Crowds expected a town hall meeting.  That's in Sanford.  Sanford.  Martin's parents expected to speak at a town hall meeting.  Thousands with their hoodies on.  Look at them in church with their hoodies.  What the fucking hoodie being the symbol of fucking whatever for this is stupid.  Stupid.  Stop it.  Stupid middle-aged white guy.  They'll be delivering communion at church with Skittles.  Right.  Oh my God.  Ah, even Tebow was out, out on the town wearing a hoodie, but I think that's what he just 
[00:49:30]  wears.  Yeah, it's because he was in Chelsea, he didn't want to be recognized coming out of a fucking  six-day avenue bookstore.  He did a very manly thing his first day in New York.  What did he do?  He went to Broadway to go see Wicked.  Did he really?  Yes, he did.  And then he had dinner in Chelsea.  Yeah.  Way to throw everyone off the scent.  What is wrong with this guy?  Because he went to see Wicked because he thought it was about vaginas.  To boo them. 
[00:50:00]  Fuck, that's funny.  Hey, and Rex Ryan coming out and saying, yeah, fucking Sanchez is in trouble, man.  But, you know, we didn't bring Tebow here to fucking hold the clipboard, which is going  to make it even worse for Sanchez.  Maybe they just had enough of Sanchez.  I mean, they want to see if Sanchez could step the fuck up and handle the pressure.  If not, then they're looking at Tebow, man.  Rex Ryan said it.  Has Sanchez let everybody down every time, you think?  He falls apart a little bit under pressure.  Maybe they've had enough of that shit. 
[00:50:30]  Like, he's supposed to be a franchise guy.  Yeah.  He's got good quarterback skills, but he doesn't have that extra little thing that fucking  wins championships.  Fucking, yeah.  He panics a little bit.  Yeah.  And Tebow certainly doesn't panic, but he doesn't have quite the quarterback skills that  Sanchez does.  In general, I would say.  He doesn't have that thing that, who's Manning for the Giants?  Not Peyton, but fucking...  Oh, Eli.  Eli.  Eli.  Eli.  Absolutely has it.  I've turned a corner on him, man.  I thought he was a joke compared to his brother.  That guy is great under pressure.  And I'm a complete idiot for thinking that, because he's great under pressure. 
[00:51:00]  You're right, Jimmy.  You're fucking right.  Want a break?  Yeah.  All righty.  God, I didn't hate what Geraldo said.  I'm an idiot.  I know.  I did what everyone does.  I should have fucking searched out the clip after I saw it trending all over the place.  Hoodie gotta eat.  And let's do that.  Hey, everybody, this is Geraldo Rivera, and you are listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door. 
[00:51:30]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah.  Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door.  Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door.  Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door.  Hey, hey, hey, yeah.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute. 
[00:52:00]  With the sex man.  Morning, sexy.  Morning.  How's your Monday?  I got a case of the moonbees.  Fucking E-Rock.  Did you buy some blue rocks for your house?  I saw you tweeting about it.  I saw that, too.  Very exciting.  Yeah, no, that was a joke.  Oh.  Why?  Why was it a joke?  I thought it was something cool to get for your pool.  Well, I don't have a pool.  Oh.  See, I thought you were decorating the Nagel Palace with some blue stones. 
[00:52:30]  I would totally do that if I had that, but I don't.  Oh.  Oh.  What a letdown.  Well, that joke went over everyone's head.  I just assumed you had a pool and got some dumb blue rocks.  I know.  That's what I thought.  Nah, it was just towards one person.  Troy Kwan.  Who was it for?  I guess Jennifer Hutt lost her American Express card over the weekend, so I just posted that  I bought all this stuff from my house on her card. 
[00:53:00]  Why are you kissing her ass?  What's wrong with you?  You need to be liked by everyone?  That's where that came from.  Jennifer Hutt.  Inside jokes with Jennifer Hutt?  Is your wife pissed at the mashup Nicole picture?  No, not at all.  Why is she sending you those shots?  I don't know.  I don't think that wedding's going to work out.  Everyone's saying that.  But why is she sending you pictures like that?  Were they nudes?  I don't know. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, we're not allowed to talk about this?  No, it's not her.  It wasn't her.  So why is she saying what?  She was playing along with...  I just threw that up there saying it was her.  And then she finally responded like two days later saying that, oh, that was just supposed  to be for you.  God, you got all this inside weird shit going on.  It's like inside jokes on Twitter.  Oh, God.  Oh, I see.  It looks like her, but it's not her.  Is it?  Let me see.  Where is that?  Oh, God.  Oh, I don't know.  What are these jokes for?  No. 
[00:54:00]  You're using Twitter for one person?  Well, you're using it to insult celebrities.  Of course I am.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Look at her there.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Wow.  Good point.  Good point, I guess.  Fuck.  Oh, E-Rock.  Use Twitter however the fuck you want.  Exactly.  Guns N' Roses news.  They're all going to sit at the same table.  For Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  The Shorty Awards?  No, not the Shorty Awards.  I love the fucking... 
[00:54:30]  They're all going to sit at the same table, but they're not...  No word on if they're going to perform.  When is that?  Tomorrow, I think.  Tomorrow night.  Oh, it's close.  Okay.  Oh.  That almost looks like her, I guess.  Oh.  I guess that's the picture that was...  That E-Rock tweeted saying it was Mesh at McColl.  Sexy, dude.  Who is that chick?  It's not Mesh at McColl.  It's something we found online.  Some girl, huh?  Pussy bulge.  From I Like Girls Daily.  I love I Like Girls Daily.  Also, check out the other account. 
[00:55:00]  I Like Sex Daily.  They have I Like Asses Daily, Booze Daily.  Well, she's getting a little out of control.  I Like Girls Daily and I Like Sex Daily.  I've been going to I Like Bill Daily, and that's not as sexy.  No.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Gallagher suffered another heart attack.  No, I know.  Another one?  I swear to God.  Wait, wait.  Another one?  Yes.  On Sunday.  Yeah, because I thought it was just like, no, we know that already.  Oh, man.  No, he's had two.  Oh, no. 
[00:55:30]  Come on.  He's had two in the last two weeks.  Oh, boy.  You know, he was in that coma from the first one.  It's a minor one.  And then he's been out of the hospital a few days, and he just had another minor one.  He's retiring.  Wow.  Fucking Gallagher has had it.  Wow.  That's not good.  Nah.  Gallagher could be.  He said he's going to retire from on-stage shows.  Yeah, he's retiring.  Wow.  Going to miss Gallagher on the show.  I swear to God, I thought it said comedian Jim Gaffigan.  A quick look.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's why I made a fucking gasp. 
[00:56:00]  Oh.  Hunger Games.  Goddamn, $155 million over the weekend.  Wow.  That's a lot of money.  That is a successful movie.  The most successful opening for a non-sequel film that came out in March or something.  I love those stats.  Where the weather was above 75 degrees.  I think that's the title they got.  Yeah.  We got Donald Sutherland from Hunger Games coming in today.  The Hunger Games at 9.30, by the way. 
[00:56:30]  And tomorrow it's Shaquille O'Neal and Aziz is coming in, huh?  Aziz, yeah.  Nice.  Aziz.  Excuse me.  Aziz and Zaria.  And Pauly D in studio tomorrow as well.  What time is he there?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  That's Wednesday.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I'm ahead of myself.  Shaq and Aziz tomorrow.  We're going to get them to fist fight.  I hope so.  That's my goal to get Aziz and Shaquille O'Neal to fucking throw down.  I'm using Shaq's shit.  I am too.  It actually smells really good.  Oh, his deodorant and shampoo.  Yeah.  It smelled good.  Is there shampoo there?  I didn't get any fucking shampoo.  I didn't see no shampoo. 
[00:57:00]  That was a body wash.  That was a body wash.  Oh, oops.  Oops.  My hair's been frizzy.  I'm body washing.  I'm fucking using his deodorant.  New Dove products.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, man.  He must go through a bottle of that body wash.  No shit.  At one sitting.  One shower.  Very excited to have Shaq on the show tomorrow.  Dick Cheney got a heart transplant and everyone made their heart jokes over the weekend on Twitter.  Everyone had their jokes, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  What was the biggest, most popular one? 
[00:57:30]  I'm going to guess something.  Oh, good.  Um, don't you, don't you have to have a heart in the first place to have a heart transplant?  Yeah, I read that one a few times.  I went with the, I wonder if they, you know, got the giant stick out of his ass while they  had him on the operating table.  Right, right.  I try to, I try to do it a little different.  A little different.  Oh, don't you have to have a heart in the first place?  I also read something, one about, you know.  Go to the Dick Cheney trend. 
[00:58:00]  Let's see what.  Eating hearts.  I tweeted a good one.  What do you got?  I said, how come you don't have no clubs or spades or, or diamonds?  That is funny.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Ah.  You know, I fucked up my own tweet.  Let me, let me, because it sounded horrible.  Let me see.  Are you finding other, uh, Dick Cheney tweets?  Mm-hmm.  I, I went, uh, what did I write?  I went, uh, uh, Cheney got a heart transplant, right, uh, right, oh, no.  What was yours?  No.  God, come on. 
[00:58:30]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  This guy, I literally lost 200 followers on this tweet.  You want me to read it?  Yes.  Oh.  People kind of liked it, though.  Dick Cheney just got a heart transplant.  Right about now, the heart is wishing he was in Trayvon Martin's chest.  Oh.  Oh.  That's a good line.  Oh, boy.  That's a rough one, but I thought it was going to be a...  And then I hashtagged it too soon.  Did you hashtag?  And people went, yes, blocked. 
[00:59:00]  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Did they hashtag, did you hashtag Trayvon?  No, I wasn't brave enough to do that.  See, that's what gets you.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, that one, because that'll get you.  I still lost about 200.  The last count, it was over two.  Oh, fuck, they fucked you.  I don't even know how many I have.  Sometimes, man, you tweet something, and those sensitive Nancys out there will block you  immediately.  And then the other one was just Dick Cheney had a heart transplant.  I wonder if they also removed that giant stick from his ass.  And then some guy writes, what, so you can lick it? 
[00:59:30]  That is good.  Good one, E-Rock.  So you can lick it?  Relax, dude.  It's just a stupid fucking joke.  I'm only 45, it was 45, 45 followers away from 90,000.  I haven't broken the 100,000 mark yet.  You will.  I just, you know.  I don't even know how many I got.  All right.  I keep track of that.  I keep track when they fucking dump me, though.  I don't even notice.  I honestly just go like, oh. 
[01:00:00]  Like, that's the first I've looked at how many.  I don't even know how many I have.  I check every 30 seconds.  Do you?  Refresh, refresh.  What are some of the Dick Cheney jokes?  Because everyone went with those whole, he had a, go ahead.  Neil Brennan.  I have some bad news.  Funny guy, by the way.  The operation was a complete success.  Dick Cheney's doctor.  That's very funny.  I have some bad news.  Bad news.  The operation was a complete success.  Neil is actually a stand-up, and he was very, very instrumental with creating Chappelle's show. 
[01:00:30]  He's a great writer.  Oh, no.  Neil Brennan is a very funny guy.  Uh, Justin Stangle, breaking Dick Cheney received a heart transplant.  Experts say he's more machine now than man.  His mind is twisted and evil.  Nice.  Um.  See, that's different.  Let's see.  Kim Jong, number un, said, now it can be told, dad donates his heart to Dick Cheney.  That's all right.  It's topical.  Uh, bearded stoner wrote, Dick Cheney got a heart. 
[01:01:00]  Now if W gets a brain and Colin Powell gets some courage, Condi can click her heels and go home.  That's good.  That's very clever.  Ah, a little, uh.  Very clever.  Right, a little Wizard of Oz there.  Oh, is that what that was?  Oh.  I didn't get that.  I thought you just didn't have flippers or something.  Oh, look at my fucking joke moving up the charts.  Look at you.  Right under Albert Brooks.  Right under Albert.  Albert Brooks says, Dick Cheney gets new heart, not to be confused with compassion.  He's a funny dude.  That is funny.  That's pretty good.  Go with Patton.  I thought Patton Oswalt had a good one, too. 
[01:01:30]  Which one is trending on his?  Oh, God.  Let me out of here.  Uh, quote, the heart that was just sewed inside of Dick Cheney.  See, that's good.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  William Black wrote, I guess Dick Cheney finally had a change of heart.  That's good.  Ah, see?  That's a little different.  That's a play on words.  Yeah.  Oh, your little, uh, stick from his ass tweet also made this.  Oh, good.  Wow.  Doing all right.  How do you spell Cheney? 
[01:02:00]  I'm going to Twitter something good.  C-H-E-N-E-Y.  Yeah.  It's what?  C-H-E-N-E-Y.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm, uh, fucking pissed off again at the mayor of New York City.  What'd she do now?  It's perpetual.  Well, this is why I hate them all in the end.  Yeah.  Uh, they want tolls on the, uh, where, on all the bridges?  On all the bridges.  Um, of course, the East River bridges are free. 
[01:02:30]  They're free.  Yeah.  Why does Long Island get a pass on that?  I think because they figured, look, it's fucking Long Island.  It's not Jersey.  It's part of New York, you know?  Let's, uh.  Is that how that works?  I never.  Let's give them a little fucking.  I never even thought of that before.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how that works.  Yeah.  So, then why are they changing the rules?  Um, because they, uh, want, uh, money.  Because the.  Because they don't know how to spend the money that they already have.  Exactly.  And that's why I hate them all.  Exactly.  They have enough money to run New York City, and period. 
[01:03:00]  I don't even want to hear the argument.  Yeah.  I don't want to hear the argument.  A lot of people use their transportation and everything else, and they still just keep  losing money.  So, now they want, they want to, uh, have bicyclists, excuse me, uh, pay tolls to cross  bridges.  Enough already.  Bicycles.  Enough already.  He's a fucking out-of-touch scumbag.  Enough already.  The mayor's an out-of-touch scumbag.  Third term douche.  Three terms.  Enough with him. 
[01:03:30]  When is he done?  Is it like.  Fuck.  Has he got a couple years left?  The tolls keep going up, and they still don't have enough money, and now they need to find  money from bicyclists.  That's how desperate this city is.  That means you're not doing your job.  He puts bike lanes everywhere, which encourages people to ride their bikes.  He fucks up that way, and then he wants to fucking tax people for riding their bikes  or tried tolls?  Part of his evil plan.  What a douchebag.  What do you think?  The fucking bikes are hurting the bridges?  Yeah.  Asshole?  How much damage does a bike do to a bridge that, you know, you gotta, it's just enough 
[01:04:00]  already.  God, what a fucking, how about instead of spending a hundred?  A hundred million to run the city, you fucking baby boy rich kid?  How about you donate that money so bicyclists and middle class people don't keep getting  fucked at the tolls?  How about that, shithead?  Because now, like, a lot of people are looking at their bikes and going, oh, fuck, I'll save  money on gas and tolls?  Yeah.  And I live close enough, so that's what I'm going to do now to commute, and now they  have to turn around and go, uh-uh.  We need your fucking pocket money, too.  No way.  Uh-uh.  If they try to charge tolls, people for bicycles just rip the fucking tolls down. 
[01:04:30]  There should be a massive project.  And there shouldn't be tolls on the East, uh, you know, crossing the East River.  Right.  Because of what Ant said.  It's part of New York.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Part of New York.  Then again, Staten Island, doesn't matter.  Staten Island going into fucking Brooklyn.  That's true.  Staten Island, uh, you pay.  They fuck Staten Island so bad, man.  Oh, God, they hit you hard.  Yeah.  They hit you hard.  Oh, boy.  Well, that's the latest from this fine city.  Now they're going after bicyclists.  That's just ridiculous.  Did we build this city on rock and roll? 
[01:05:00]  We sure did, eh?  Yeah.  It's got to pay for it somehow.  Sure did.  That fucking song is in the new Muppets movie, which is the go-to movie in my house right  now.  Is it?  And, uh, that song is in it.  And all I keep thinking in my head is, my dick's all shitty.  My dick's all shitty.  Ah, this one.  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  Dick's all shitty.  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  So, isn't this great? 
[01:05:30]  I love the midi.  Yeah.  The horrible midi fucking.  Who wrote this?  This is great.  Ah, favorite of mine.  Is it a fan or no?  Was it?  I don't know.  That's a good one.  Say you won't blow me.  Like it in your face.  It's so blatant.  Say you only take the cock.  In your dirty face.  Now I'm all filthy. 
[01:06:00]  There's two real hard dicks.  One mix.  One mix.  One mix.  Just like a black man's.  But not quite as thick.  What makes this song?  He sells it.  Oh, yeah.  The fool needs a diaper.  Yeah.  Oh, he's yelling.  My dick's all shitty.  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  Oh, my dick's all shitty. 
[01:06:30]  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  No interpreting this any differently than it is.  He just went right for it.  My dick's all shitty from your asshole.  Oh, my dick's all shitty from your asshole.  Oh, my dick's all shitty from your asshole.  Nice.  I love it.  Dun, dun.  Dun, dun.  Someone very mad that I'm saying bicyclist instead of cyclist.  Oh, stop it.  What's the difference?  I don't know.  In the story, it says bicyclist.  You're right to say bicyclist.  It's a martial guy. 
[01:07:00]  Martial.  What?  Let's say hi to Kirby.  Kirby.  Yeah, I have a problem with you.  What are you, laying in by the street and by the grass and something, Kirby?  Are you a vacuum cleaner guy or something?  Yeah, Kirby.  Where's Curb A?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Is the garbage sitting right by you, Kirby?  Is someone getting kicked to you, Kirby?  Hey, where's Durwood?  Yeah, I got kicked to the Kirby or something?  Okay, I'm punching out. 
[01:07:30]  Cyclist, please.  Cyclist.  Why?  Is that what you say up there?  What's the difference?  What do I say up here?  It's English, my friend.  I don't know.  You're Canada.  What's wrong with bicyclist?  Yeah, what's wrong with saying bicyclist?  You're a bicyclist.  I would rather say cyclist.  It would be much easier for me to say, trust me.  Maybe bicyclist is a cyclist that sucks dick and pussy.  There you go.  Hey, how's your enthusiasm?  That's from Truth.  That wasn't mine.  Truth Diggins.  Hey, can I heal my appetite or something? 
[01:08:00]  By the way.  By the way, by the way, by the way.  Edward in East Rutherford.  So Bloomberg cuts trans fats and ban smoking because he wants people to be healthy and then  punishes them for riding a bike.  Yes.  It all doesn't make sense across the board.  They're all idiots.  His dick's all shitty.  Take the fucking money you got and figure out where you're not spending it properly.  Yeah.  It's not my problem anymore. 
[01:08:30]  Holy fuck.  They just keep doing it.  I was listening to the news on the way in about shit like this.  And if you had somebody in your household that had a budget and was supposed to take  care of your household business and they were constantly fucking up and just the way  they solved it was just asking you for more money.  Right.  It's like, well, no, you got this, you know, budget for the household to run the household  and stuff and you keep fucking up.  And then you're sending like a bunch of money to friends.  It's like, well, no. 
[01:09:00]  How about you pull back?  Don't send money to friends.  Don't, don't, you know, shop around a little.  Look for cheaper prices for things.  And then maybe you won't have to keep asking me for money.  Right.  But they just keep asking for money.  You'd say, what do you do?  You'd get all pissed.  I see people every day in New York City doing their jobs, going to work, spending like crazy.  So what the fuck?  It's the exact same city as it was 20 years ago.  So what are you doing differently?  Yeah, what are you doing?  You're not spending the money right.  We didn't read far enough.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no. 
[01:09:30]  We didn't.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  This is not necessarily the mayor pushing this through.  This is a guy named, this is a former traffic commissioner.  Taxi McTexter?  Sam McSchwartz, actually.  The guy who quoted the Gridlock Sam, that guy.  Gridlock Sam?  Gridlock Sam.  Bloomberg's in Asia right now.  He's not supporting a congestion price plan.  That's one part of Asia.  Lady boy.  But they want to keep cars out of Central Business District below 60th.  Schwartz wants to reduce. 
[01:10:00]  That's why it reduced tolls on Uptown Bridges, the Triborough, Whitestone, and Throgsneck Bridges.  The round trip tab would drop from $13 to $8.  That's never going to happen.  No, no.  But I'm saying he's trying to balance it, I think.  Uh-oh.  Oh, wait.  We're assholes.  Get some money from the bike guys.  Or just put these Midtown things.  But that'll never happen.  That'll be the excuse to do the bike thing, and then they'll never fucking lower it.  Okay, maybe, yeah.  I think.  No, you might be right, dude. 
[01:10:30]  They never do the right thing in the end.  They say they're doing it for this reason.  It's never for that reason.  God, my dick's all shitty.  From your asshole.  I can't get that out of my head now.  I'm going to sing that all day.  Exactly, you're right.  Yeah.  You know what?  Matt in Brooklyn makes a good point.  It is cyclists, so you don't exclude the assholes riding unicycles. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, how hipster is that?  That just looks exhausting.  Have you ever tried a unicycle?  No.  I tried it once.  I think I fucking tore my fucking ACLU.  I want to say ACLU so bad, but that's certainly not right.  Civil Liberties Union, yeah.  I know, yeah.  It's an ACL, right?  Yeah, it is an ACL.  You tried the unicycle?  No, it looks dumb.  It is dumb.  It is stupid.  I like the extreme unicyclists now. 
[01:11:30]  They're doing ramps and everything.  No, you still look stupid.  It's like doing fucking BMX on one of those giant front wheels with the little back wheel  bike.  Imagine just doing a cross-up.  You go off a fucking dirt hill and you cross your fucking giant wheel up.  I would assume jackass did that stunt.  If not, someone should get on it.  I think they did.  Okay, because that would be a great video to watch.  I think they did.  Hey, you were listening to the news on the way in.  Did you hear the Facebook thing?  Uh, yes.  Yes.  Are they trying to make it a law or trying to... 
[01:12:00]  They're trying to see if it's legal at all.  I'll see if it's legal at all.  Because a lot of employers, potential employers, if you go in and fill out a job application,  along with the rest of the questions they ask you, they're asking for people's password  to their Facebook account because they want to, like, check out what this guy's all  about.  Wait, no, no, no.  Pass?  You're sure it's password or...  Or just accept a friend request?  I heard fucking password.  Well, that's just...  They want to be able to dig into, like, the shit that you might have, like, behind the  privacy thing or something. 
[01:12:30]  What?  And they're trying to see if it's legal because I guess bosses are actually asking for this.  They've been doing this and they're looking to see if it's legal because an employer can't  ask you certain things that would be on Facebook.  Race, age, sexual orientation, and if they deny you employment based on those things that  they find on Facebook...  What the fuck?  Wouldn't they get enough info by just checking out your Facebook page?  You would think.  I think if...  But they want to go even deeper?  I think they want to...  You know, smart people kind of alter their social media accordingly if you're going for 
[01:13:00]  a job or shit like that.  You would, you know, probably take down some of the hooker fucking shit you got up for.  Why wouldn't you just have another Facebook page?  A clean version if you're going for a job, I mean.  I don't know.  I guess that's what they're thinking, you know.  I could see them looking at your public page to see, like, you know, there's nothing wrong  with seeing what a person is like.  If you're going to put it out there.  Yeah, if you're putting it out there, but fucking private shit, fuck you.  Yeah, it's about passwords.  They want your password. 
[01:13:30]  It is password.  Yeah.  Wow.  What job asked for that?  That's illegal.  I don't know.  That's completely illegal.  That's probably one guy.  What job is that?  That doesn't make sense to me.  Or some high school student just got suspended or expelled from things he twittered?  And they will lose that case legal, because the Supreme Court backed up a ruling that  said you couldn't punish students for making a parody of their principal's MySpace page  at their home.  Right.  You can't punish people for the shit they do at home.  Yeah.  Well, people are.  They're punishing a lot of people for what you do at home and what you tweet. 
[01:14:00]  That's where the privacy stuff's getting crazy.  We're so willing to put a lot of information out there, though.  We're lucky because we're dumb fucking on the radio, in the public eye kind of people.  So we're not really tweeting anything that we don't fucking say on a daily basis here.  But you get your regular Joe out there that's just working his job, and he says something  that might be deemed inappropriate.  The guy's going to lose his fucking gig.  Well, I got shit for an email.  This is a weird line. 
[01:14:30]  And the company was not that bad with it, actually.  I got an email from some scumbag who was mad at something I said.  So I wrote him back, fucking nasty.  And then, of course, this little fucking cocksucker copies all the bosses and stuff.  Really?  But they were actually okay with it.  They're like, eh, you know, it's a subscriber.  You try not to if you can help it.  There was no ramifications for it.  But it's like, that's what little fucking dirtbags people are.  But there was no penalty for it, which was good. 
[01:15:00]  And I would never, ever edit a response to somebody where if you write me and attack me  and I attack you back, all bets are off, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  And on Twitter, if I attack somebody, I never want to hear shit from the company.  No.  If I say on Twitter.  Of course not.  I mean, business.  What do you got on this, Travis?  Nothing.  There's another story today.  Nothing.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care.  Bye-bye, Travis.  Safe trip home.  Yeah.  Why would you start something with nothing?  Everything, guys.  And then, and then, that is funny.  It's like, so what's up?  Oh, nothing. 
[01:15:30]  I was just going to say, well, you said nothing.  I have so much for you.  There's another story today.  This high school kid that was expelled from school because a tweet that he wrote at home  said fuck.  Whoa.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that's right.  It sounds suspicious like the story I just mentioned.  Wow.  Because Jim just was talking about when I'm walking down the hallway.  Yeah, sure.  What happened in Florida?  Did someone get shot?  Go ahead. 
[01:16:00]  You covered.  Go ahead.  Boy, he's right.  You did have nothing.  Yeah, apparently.  You should open up and go, to reiterate.  By the way.  Oh, poor Travis.  Look, there's 15 seconds when I'm walking down that hallway.  Oh, boy.  And when the gold happens.  Headset.  Apparently.  That's embarrassing, right?  Headset.  Headset.  Yep.  Kenny does.  I know Kenny does.  Kenny doesn't get called his pants down.  That's true.  He does not.  Ever.  His giant pants.  Yeah.  With his fucking huge pants down. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  Well, fuck me.  With his giant fucking looking like he has a boner fold in the front of his pants when  he sits down.  What do you think of the Tiger?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing on Tiger Woods?  You're a big golf guy.  Yeah, I think it's great.  You think he's back back?  I think he's playing a lot better this year than he did last year.  Yeah, because he's got that other win that was not an official PGA event in December.  So he's won twice in three months.  Yeah.  I'd love to see him win the Masters.  That'd be great.  Ooh.  Two weeks.  Yep.  Two weeks to go?  They got the week off, basically?  Or are some of the guys playing in...  I have no idea. 
[01:17:00]  I'm sure there's something going on there.  Look at Kenny in his big pants.  It looks like an Undertaker.  His giant leather jacket.  Jesus.  He just has giant clothes.  I know.  Okay.  He played great, though.  Okay.  Yeah, he did.  He putted well.  Mm-hmm.  Which he hasn't done in a long time.  And what, just like a week after he had to get out of that other tournament?  Yeah, I guess it was true.  He fucking had a slight injury or something.  And the Post puts it on the front page.  Oh, you see the Post today?  The Post.  Look out, ladies.  There's no other news in the world. 
[01:17:30]  Look out, ladies.  It's back.  Look, he's back.  Tiger wins for first time since sex scandal.  And in big letters, look out, ladies.  Oh, boy.  He's ready to head over to Perkins.  I don't know why anyone doesn't take the New York Post seriously.  Who gives a turkey?  It really is silly to say that.  Look out, ladies.  That means he's probably back to, you know, banging broads.  Yeah, could be.  Could be.  Gets him in his zone.  Why wouldn't he?  Gets him in his zone.  Obviously, he likes it.  Why wouldn't he? 
[01:18:00]  Because every fucking girl he's been with talks.  So he's probably a little paranoid.  But he's not married.  So who gives a shit now?  That's true.  Single tiger can do whatever the fuck he wants.  Good point.  That book comes out tomorrow.  Are we having Haney in?  I forget.  Did we say hi to...  Hi.  Did we say yes to Haney?  I'm not sure if you guys said yes to him.  Hank Haney?  Mr. Haney.  His former...  It was Tiger's swing coach who now decided he has to be an asshole.  Oh, he supposedly had a tell-all book.  We did say yes to him.  But I want the book first.  And now he has to be an asshole to Tiger, right? 
[01:18:30]  Wow.  Don't they sign nine disclosures?  Why does he have to be an asshole to Tiger?  Probably not in sports.  No one knew Hank Haney's name before he started working with Tiger.  Hank Haney?  Maybe.  Maybe they do.  Maybe it's just for while you're working with him.  Who knows?  You could get someone to sign a lifetime...  I'm sure if there was anything preventing him from releasing this book tomorrow, it would  have been taken care of.  I love the fact that Tiger's lawyers crushed that fucking...  That fucking cunt.  I think that's the one who blabbed about it or something, because she had a non-disclosure. 
[01:19:00]  A blabber mouth.  Yeah.  Rachel Lucatel.  And I guess...  I don't know what the details were, but she hinted to it or something on the celebrity  sex...  Whatever the fuck show was.  Oh, yeah.  And I love the fact that fucking twat Gloria Allred could do nothing about it.  Oh, how fucking hateable.  I'll bet you Gloria Allred kept her percentage, though.  Oh, yeah.  If she got one.  I'll bet.  That's my guess.  Gloria Allred.  Yeah.  We're going to break, because we've got things to talk about next.  Things!  Truth's on our side, Bubba.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:19:30]  I want to know about this James Cameron after the break.  Oh, my God.  Director.  Guy's in a fucking...  Adventurer.  He is an adventurer.  More than a director.  He's fucking crazy, man.  Yeah, we'll talk about it next.  I just want to know how you get a signal from that fucking...  What?  He was tweeting.  He was tweeting.  No.  Yeah.  Well, he obviously went through Verizon.  Oh, can I tell you?  I was so annoyed on Friday.  I'm in the elevator, and I'm seeing people with Verizon iPhones texting with no problem  in the elevator, and I'm just constantly dropping signal with AT&T. 
[01:20:00]  Why don't you get some Verizon?  Because I'm still under contract.  A contract?  I don't have lots of money like you to break my contract.  But how much is it to break the contract?  Hundreds of dollars, and I have two phones.  They're not fucking owning up to their part of the bargain.  They're a terrible fucking company.  That's fine.  I hate AT&T.  Yeah, yeah.  It's terrible.  Verizon?  You have Verizon stinks, though, with the text messaging.  Verizon's text messaging?  Yeah, I lose a lot of texts, and a lot of them are not go through.  Really?  Even though they go through.  Yeah, Verizon's text needs work. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, but the phone calls, it's worth it.  Yeah?  Yeah, I wouldn't...  AT&T just stinks to high heaven, though.  All right.  James Cameron's got some fucking balls.  Let me see.  Yeah, we'll talk about it next, because we're going to take some time with this shit.  All right.  Stay there.  How's everyone today?  Hope you're having a good Monday.  Hi. 
[01:21:00]  Hi there.  I have a song running through my head.  Uh-oh.  You're writing it?  It's all shitty?  No.  Oh, what?  Did you ever just hear something by the Ramones called, Somebody Put Something in My Drink?  Oh, yeah.  You have heard that?  Fuck, yeah.  I had never heard that.  Like I said, I just kind of found the Ramones recently.  Dude, that has been in my fucking head.  It's an amazing song, isn't it?  Somebody!  That is so fucking catchy.  How's my acting?  Oh.  Not bad, right? 
[01:21:30]  Taking acting classes.  I've never heard this before.  Oh, I thought it was a big hit.  I've never heard this one.  Just the chorus is just...  But don't you feel like you have?  Yes.  Yeah.  Sorry.  No, it was very true.  People take the Ramones very seriously.  Oh, I like this song. 
[01:22:00]  I remember the kids that used to listen to this.  Somebody put something, somebody put something in my drink.  Somebody put something, somebody put something.  Sounds like another song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I asked him a ton of that. 
[01:22:30]  But that's fucking been stuck in my head.  That somebody.  Oh, fuck.  It's good.  Yeah, yeah.  I like it a lot, actually.  Oh, there's a Pat Benatar riff thing.  I like it.  What's the Pat Benatar riff?  Heartbreaker.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Heartbreaker.  Heartbreaker.  Love taker.  I don't know which was first.  Heartbreaker.  Love taker.  Somebody put a heartbreaker in my drinks.  Where are you at with the Pat Benatar?  She had her time.  Wasn't bad, right?  Wasn't bad.  She had her time.  What's your favorite one?  Love is a Battlefield. 
[01:23:00]  I'm not going to remember.  I like the Love is a Battlefield video.  Leave me alone.  They used to do the videos, and in the middle of the music, they'd have dialogue from the  drama that was going on in the fucking video.  Just play the stupid song, please.  Yeah.  We are young.  With the before video, like the drama leading up to this.  The drama leading, and then all of a sudden they start dancing.  Solve a song.  What, really?  God damn, she was sexy, man. 
[01:23:30]  I forget.  What does she look like now?  Oh, you want to do this?  I guess.  I'll turn this up for a second.  We can hear a little bit of Pat Benatar.  Let's rock it.  Let's rock out.  Love is a Battlefield.  Oh, she's on a bus.  Where is she going?  Is that Times Square?  Yeah.  Winston!  She was pretty.  Old school Times Square.  No promises.  Wasn't she with Jerry Brown?  Was she?  Married to him or no?  I don't think so.  She's just singing in the bus. 
[01:24:00]  Oh.  She's leaving her parents' house.  You leave this house now!  And then she's got to sing.  And then she's singing her responses.  You can just forget about coming back.  Now the father's got to stop talking.  I know.  He's the same age she is.  That's her fucking younger brother.  If you leave this.  I'm in the middle of the song.  I'd be so embarrassed to sing a video.  Oh, the brother.  She's got to say goodbye to her brother looking out the window.  Yeah.  She's got the Japanese writing t-shirt on, too.  Of course she does.  That was all the rage.  Oh, she's hooking.  Please, hook. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, shit.  Girls, girls, girls.  She's walking down a seedy street.  Please blow somebody like fucking...  Oh.  Oh, but she made it to the fucking bus terminal.  She's at the bus station.  Oh, my God.  What are these gay guys that are coming up with?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Oh, no.  I didn't...  Yeah, what happens here?  She falls in with, like, a pimp or something?  I hope so.  Oh.  Oh, the father's looking at girls.  Where's Morgan Freeman when you need him?  Now the father's worried.  Where is she?  Now, where's my girl?  I should have said to leave.  She's in the body. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, that awful 80s fucking bandana look.  Oh, no, Pat.  Look at the guy with the short shorts.  You see that?  Oh, the father can't eat.  The father said he can't eat.  He's thinking of his little girl in the big city.  Yeah.  Sucking cock.  That's all I'm thinking of.  All right.  She's walking into some place.  What is this?  The bandana's a rough and tumble area.  You think she's trying to find herself?  Oh, she goes to the bar. 
[01:25:30]  There's a guy in a Hawaiian shirt in the bar.  The greasy pimp guy.  Oh, please start hooking.  Well, I think this is supposed to be a sort of supposed to represent hooking.  But she's dancing with guys.  But she's doing it without any emotion or anything.  With that awful fucking 80s.  Yeah, her hair is up in like a headband.  It looks like they put her hair in a headband and then threw an M80 in the middle of it. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  What is the weird...  What is her job?  To dance for old guys?  I don't know.  What is going on, man?  See, dancing represents fucking.  She's a hooker.  Then what is she doing to his?  She's writing letters to home.  She's writing her brother and saying, I'm a fucking cock.  I'm fine.  No, basically saying, I'm doing well in the big city.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, look at the pants and the outfit.  She's probably misrepresenting what she's actually doing to her family, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Leave me alone!  Oh, she steps in front of the pimp. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  Now she's going to have a dance battle.  Oh, no.  Dance battle.  Dance battle.  Yay!  Yeah, yeah.  Dance battle.  Dancing off.  Dance battle.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Oh, he backs up.  She's starting.  Whoa!  Oh, dance battle.  Dance.  Dancing.  It's the thrillers.  It's the ripoff.  I know.  They're just kind of.  Let's see what the guy does back, though.  Is he going to pull the gun out and shoot them all?  Yeah, because she's wearing a hoodie on her clit.  Oh, this dance battle is going well. 
[01:27:00]  She's kicking ass on the pimp guy.  Oh, she's backing up.  Wow, she's really bad at this.  Yeah, she's awful.  She's awful.  Look at all the bad dancing girls in the background.  Who is she defeating?  Stephen Hawking?  Who stinks?  He does the same move 20 times.  It's really bad.  Oh, and there's a bunch of them dancing behind, fighting off the pimp.  Coney 2012 guy did a better dance on the sidewalk.  He's laughing the fuck out.  Oh, the pimp has the worst smile.  Oh, he really does. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, shit, buddy.  He ain't giving up easy.  He ain't giving up easy.  Take that, bitch.  Take that, bitch.  Dance face off.  80s dance.  He can really dance, though.  Oh, yeah.  He's going.  He's going to town.  Oh, no.  Oh, a drink to the face.  She threw a fucking 17-ounce drink in his face.  That was huge.  Jesus.  It was a big gulp of vodka.  That looked like Titanic footage.  She's trying to wiggle her non-existent boobies.  I know.  Jesus.  She's taking all the girls out of that place.  She's setting them free.  They're all going to dance. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Benatar wins the dance battle.  She takes all the girls out of there.  And they're still dancing.  Yeah.  It's in the middle of the morning now.  It's the morning.  What are they doing?  With their 80s gloves.  She's going back home.  She's got to be going back home.  Same clothes that she came there with?  Yeah.  Look, I love these fucking 80s outfits.  80s outfits.  It was kind of like this post-apocalyptic view of the future.  Yes.  Look.  That's kind of what they thought the future was supposed to look like.  Oh, boy.  Now she's got to admit that daddy was right.  Ding, ding, ding, ding. 
[01:28:30]  Snapping her fingers, walking down the street alone.  She goes home smelling like fucking cum.  Yeah.  Oh, does she see her dad?  That's it?  You just know she's going home.  And meanwhile, you just know.  They should show the pimp following her and dragging her by her Benatar hair back into the car.  Right.  What, he was in 83 or so?  Yeah, what does she look like now?  Probably 83, yeah.  Pat Benatar, 2012.  I want to download some fucking Pat Benatar, though.  Some Pat Benatar.  Fuck yeah, that was good.  Yeah.  What's another big song by her?  Oh, my God. 
[01:29:00]  Heartbreaker.  Heartbreaker's good.  She's a heartbreaker love maker.  She's in a million.  Shadows of the Night.  We're ready with the shadows of the night.  Somebody is going to fucking download Pat Benatar's greatest hits.  You can't find what she looks like now there, Sam?  Oh, come on.  Yeah, there she is.  This is like...  She actually...  This is Child of the 80s shit right here, Sam.  She isn't hideous.  Proving our point, by the way. 
[01:29:30]  I mean, that's her?  You've got to fully factor in how old she is, you know?  She's no kid.  Yeah, she's a little bad.  No.  Yeah, she's...  There's nothing wrong with her.  She's all right.  Yeah.  She made it.  She made it.  She made it.  She made it.  The tough years.  Oh, she looks good, man.  She didn't get all fat and shit.  She looks good.  Give me another Pat Benatar song, Ero.  We did that one, though.  No, we didn't.  Well, we did.  Me and Ant did.  How about... 
[01:30:00]  Does she ever slow it down?  Well, this one's kind of slow, right?  No, man.  It kicks in, man.  Bam!  Yeah.  Child of the 80s.  Oh, of course.  Oh, Hell is for Children, of course.  Hell is for Hell.  Hit me with...  Hell is for Hell.  Hell is for Children.  She's not on iTunes.  Hit me with your best shot.  Invincible.  In the heat of the night.  Oh, this is a big one.  This is a huge hit.  Yeah, man.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[01:30:30]  God, we sound like queers right now.  We are.  Well, good.  Promises in the Dark.  Oh, that was a good one.  Promises in the Dark.  She's not.  We Belong.  This is Promises in the Dark, right?  She has had a lot of hits, man.  Oh, yeah, she is.  She was fucking huge there in the 80s.  Yeah.  Should we know?  That's it. 
[01:31:00]  This is the slow one.  A lot of chorus echo on our voice.  Not slow, Anne.  This one.  No, it kicks in.  Oh, boy, does this kick in.  She really belts it out.  Oh, love is the battlefield.  Well, I'll see you.  You're going to want this one, Jimmy.  I'm getting the greatest hits.  She's got flange voice in this.  It's a good 80s effect.  Now we've got to wait for the kick in.  Oh, it's got to kick in.  And then we'll move on.  It's got to kick in.  Just when you think you've done. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, God.  We play all the hits.  Opie and Anthony show.  All right, get ready.  Oh, wait until it kicks in.  This is nothing.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Wait, wait, wait.  Promises where?  Where are they?  In the what?  In the what?  Yeah!  Whoa, Jimmy's pogoing. 
[01:32:00]  He's doing the Charleston.  I always look straight ahead right there.  Straight ahead.  It's uncomfortable.  Jimmy's the best dancer.  Why are you doing that?  Hey, Jimmy, you're going to dance tonight.  Oh, my God.  Brings me right back to growing up in the 80s, Sam.  Yep.  Holy fuck.  I'm right there now.  Who doesn't remember this being a child of the 80s?  I guess those commercials from the 70s last week also helped you remember the 80s.  Well, I was a very young child when all that hit. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, sure.  Your prom song was Time in a Bottle.  Are we done with Pat Benatar?  We just lost most of our audience.  Well, they're all jamming the path.  Now we've got to try to get them back.  They're all jamming the path from Benatar.  Hit this again.  Hi, guys.  She was all about the video.  Yeah, yeah.  She took her time with her videos.  She was in that whole era where the video was paramount. 
[01:33:00]  She was a bomber pilot in one of them.  Shadows of the Night, I think.  Was it Shadows of the Night?  Look at Shadows of the Night.  And she's like flying an old World War II fucking plane.  Yeah, I just call it a plane.  I'm sure you know the exact model of it.  I don't remember.  Oh, because she's like a Rosie the Riveter.  Oh, let's hear this.  This is a good one.  She's just a working girl in this one.  They're all building.  Yeah.  She just starts.  She's building parts with a Rosie the Riveter outfit on. 
[01:33:30]  And then says, fuck this.  I want to fucking.  She's doing a plane.  Now she's daydreaming by a machine like I used to at Apollo air conditioning.  Oh, it's a P-51 Mustang.  Oh, that's not a Mustang.  Nice thing you know, guess who's flying the Mustang.  Ooh.  I'll bet P to the V is.  Ah, shit.  Oh, see?  Now she's.  Why is she.  Why are these 40s pilots.  Why do they have mullets?  Yeah, they look like fucking.  Oh, those are little trainers. 
[01:34:00]  Really?  Yeah.  What's the name for plane?  Midnight Angel.  Midnight Angel.  Oh, yuck.  Yeah.  Oh, yuck.  Midnight Cowboy it should be.  Did they do this out at fucking Republic Airport?  Probably.  All based in New York.  Hey.  Hey.  That's a Judd something.  Reigold.  Hamilton from Fast Times.  Yeah, it's fucking Caddyshack Day.  No.  You're in a Caddyshack Day.  I mean, yeah, yeah.  Sorry.  Fast Times.  You're right.  So, baby, take my hand. 
[01:34:30]  It'll be alright.  I honestly think that's Republic Airport.  Where are they flying to?  They're on a mission, Jimmy.  To do what?  To bomb the Nazis.  Oh.  Pat Benatar is the first woman combat pilot.  You're actually Tom Cruise.  Oh.  Didn't fucking top that.  Now she's pointing down like something's happening down there.  Oh, no.  She's getting a period.  She wants to drop clots on the enemy.  They're going to go take a look-see. 
[01:35:00]  Rusty surprise.  Come on.  See, Nazis.  Wow.  A real swastika in a...  Oh, shit.  They went all over the swastika.  Watch her land.  Is this Valkyrie?  She's turning the Jews in.  That's why she's going.  Wait, where'd they land?  Exactly.  It's night now.  Now they're just walking around with the Nazis.  Are they going to take out the Nazis?  Why'd they bomb them?  Why do they still got their bomber hats on?  Who with a plane lands to confront Nazis?  You don't.  You just bomb them.  Or you parachute him.  You don't fly the plane in yourself, get out, and then go on a mission. 
[01:35:30]  They should show her in Japan carrying fucking little boy.  It goes off.  Dumb cunt.  Hitting the nose of the bomb with a hammer.  Why is Slim Whitman sitting on this thing?  Are they getting the secret codes now?  And they look so 80.  I think they're stealing the Enigma machine.  Oh, now there's dynamite.  Oh, no.  They're planting dynamite.  They're blowing the place up.  No, it's a good time.  Get it? 
[01:36:00]  Oh, no.  Kablooey time.  This is Inglourious Bastards back in, like, 83.  Yeah.  So they ripped off a Pat Benatar video?  Yes.  Who is this 80s chick in Hitler's bunker?  I know.  Oh, it's supposed to be Ava?  J.T. Walsh.  How fucking awful is this?  Oh, it's terrible.  What a terrible video.  You know, this is horrible.  They're blowing up Nazis here.  The guy's kissing his frulein in the window.  Oh, he sees something.  Uh-oh, he's armed.  They're walking away.  Hey, boys.  Hey, you. 
[01:36:30]  We got a problem.  We got a problem.  Intruders.  Let's get them.  How did they decide this song, this video was good for this song?  They're riding a fucking scooter.  Look, she parked it.  They parked Midnight Angel in the fucking driveway.  How did they get the plane there?  The Nazis didn't notice a plane landing in their driveway.  How did they not hear outside the fucking driveway?  That's hilarious.  And she took off again.  Now she's singing into the little airplane microphone.  Yeah.  Because she's flying again.  Yeah.  The tower's going, why are you singing? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, get the fuck out of there.  Exactly.  Enough of the singing.  Please get shot down.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Nazis.  The Nazis got her in his crosshairs.  Please shoot him down.  Guns are firing.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  There's smoke.  Plane is fucked up.  Oh, those are Nazis getting shot.  Oh, no.  Oh, come on.  Why did she park in the German plane?  I don't know.  That just doesn't seem right.  This is horrible.  Uh-oh.  The Nazis going down in flames.  Oh, boo.  Pat Benatar killed the Nazis.  Yeah, I was hoping she'd get a pontoon and put it right up her ass. 
[01:37:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Now the head of the Luftwaffe is very annoyed.  They give the old A-OK.  And they're flying close enough at night to do the A-OK thing.  To do the A-OK to each other.  Now they're flying home.  Oh, she's back to Rosie the Riveter.  Oh, she's just changing.  How long does this go on after this?  An hour and ten minutes.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yes.  All right.  She's back in the drill press.  She's like, well, that was a good dream.  Is it going to be one of those videos?  Or was it?  Oh, yeah.  They love doing that.  No, she's just cranking.  No, that was just a dream.  Cranking our machine. 
[01:38:00]  And she goes to the bathroom and stinks it up.  From the horrible diet they had back then?  Yeah.  She goes in and takes a nice meatloaf and lasagna lunch shit.  Fucking stinks up the whole warehouse.  God, 80s videos suck.  I can't believe we were fucking analyzing a Pat Benatar video.  That's what I'm wanting in realism.  Yes.  Yeah, the videos back then had to be these giant, like, production numbers.  Little drama.  With the story, drama, special effects.  Madonna had a few of those, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:38:30]  Along those same lines, Twisted Sisters videos in the 80s.  Oh, yeah.  All had the same guy yelling at the same kid before going into a movie.  Well, because Niedermeyer from Animal House.  Because it worked once.  They decided, let's put it in all our videos.  I want to rock it.  Put Niedermeyer on it.  He's a sneaky little shit like you.  Uh-huh.  Dean Wormer.  Are we really going to watch this now?  Oh, there's an advertisement on Twisted Sisters.  We're not going to take.  Dink, dink, dink.  No.  We ain't going to take it.  I don't like the, like, ain'ts.  We're not going to. 
[01:39:00]  I know.  And yet, this is a good song.  Like, I listen to these songs, and I'm like, ah, I do enjoy them.  What is this?  This is a new one?  Oh, no.  It was an advertisement.  I thought that was him.  For hoodies.  Okay, God.  See, Martin Lawrence.  Oh, shit.  I'm going to add for hoodies.  All right.  Uh, what a...  Pass the carrots, please.  Niedermeyer.  Can you move the arrow, Sam, or I'll bite your fingers. 
[01:39:30]  Can I add the excuse, please?  What a dick.  The wife's petrified.  Oh, boy.  He's going to say something.  Faithfully submitted.  Douglas Niedermeyer.  Sergeant at Arms.  It's great.  Feels like dinner at my house when I was a kid.  What a great prick he is.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-oh.  Here's the music of...  What is that? 
[01:40:00]  What is that?  I know what that is.  That's music.  Douglas C, please.  Douglas.  He's just a child.  Don't Douglas see me.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Uh-oh.  Kid's playing guitar in the room.  What's up there?  Damn. 
[01:40:30]  Kid sucks.  Yeah, he really is bad.  He's not even playing with the music.  No, no, no, no, no.  Bam.  Damn.  Damn.  All right, mister.  What do you think you're doing?  I like when he looks at the poster of Twisted Sister.  This is a pigsty.  I want you to straighten up this area now.  You are a disgusting slob.  Stand up straight.  Tuck in that shirt.  Adjust that belt buckle.  Tie those shoes. 
[01:41:00]  Twisted Sister.  What is that?  He points at D.  What is that?  I like that smile off your face.  Oh, boy.  Do you understand?  What is that?  A Twisted Sister pin on your uniform?  What kind of a man are you?  You're worthless and weak.  You do nothing.  You are nothing. 
[01:41:30]  You sit in here all day and play that sick, repulsive, electric twanger.  I carried an M16 and you, you carry that, that, that guitar.  He's spitting like crazy.  Who are you?  Where do you come from?  Are you listening to me?  What do you want to do with your life?  I want to rock. 
[01:42:00]  Kid does look like a fucking waste.  Oh, now it's just him.  Now it turns into an Eastside Dave video.  It's just fucking Douglas Niedermeyer.  His mother's in the woman's throwing fucking water in his face to Lakeham.  He's just falling down.  And then the song.  Oh, he turns into D.  Oh, where not?  He turns into D.  He's spinning in a big circle.  He was spinning round and round, and that made him into D. Snyder.  He ain't gonna take it.  Oh, well, I don't know.  Why is he singing to the man?  Oh, wow. 
[01:42:30]  This is so fucking silly.  Yeah, 80s.  And now D's just singing to the breakfast table.  Singing to the whole family.  This must seem silly.  Yeah, there's a man in an outfit.  He looks like Odorous Yurunga singing to us.  There's a tranny singing to us.  Why is Jim's date singing to us and the band is here having oatmeal?  Everyone's turning into the band.  I used to love in the 80s videos also, you had to pay the attention to the lead singer. 
[01:43:00]  He's like the guy.  But then the rest of the band had to get in there.  So I was like, all right, we'll just give them a couple of shots in the video.  A small part in the video.  All right, there you go.  That's great.  We were supposed to talk about James Cameron.  Oh, my God, we were.  The James Cameron.  He took this little dildo down to the Marianas.  It's amazing.  He went by himself?  All alone.  Seven miles down in the ocean?  Seven miles down.  Wow.  35,000 feet and change. 
[01:43:30]  Wow.  A mile lower than the Everest is high.  Wow.  And he can only see how many feet in front of him, you think?  Well, that's just that.  How does that work?  Maybe up to 100, I would guess?  Probably at most, yeah.  At most, right?  They put a lot of light.  They put lights all over this fucking thing.  And they had it where it didn't kick up as much sand.  Thank you.  I was saying silt earlier.  It was driving me nuts.  But it is silt.  It is.  But most people would just say sand. 
[01:44:00]  Well, it's silt.  That's the mistake they made back in the day?  Yeah.  Last time people were down, they were in the 60s.  Really?  Yeah.  It was two guys in their baths sphere.  Why haven't they gone back?  I guess they were like, ah, it's a deep hole.  And then after a while, people were like, ah.  Stopped doing shit after the 60s.  I don't know.  We really did.  We really had a nice start with that moon thing.  And then just went, ah.  Put a man on the moon and do those other things.  Like, fuck women.  Fuck interns in my pool.  Have them get blowjobs to my chiefs of staff.  Teddy looks a little tense. 
[01:44:30]  Would you mind putting his brain cancerous penis in your mouth?  Give Robin a handjob in the kitchen.  Are we back to Beardsley?  And this DeCard.  Is it Beardsley?  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  But we should have had a fucking hotel on the moon by now.  We just gave up.  On the moon, yeah.  Easily.  Come on.  Well, all the technology that they've acquired since they were down in the trench last time.  Forty-some-odd years ago, right?  Yeah, so now it doesn't kick up as much silt. 
[01:45:00]  And they got lighting and cameras that are really good.  Yeah.  And he apparently got some really amazing footage down there.  And what is this?  Is this going to be some kind of documentary or is it footage for a film?  I'm sure it's going to be an amazing documentary.  Or knowing him, it'll probably be both.  He's a ballsy dude, though.  He is.  To have as much money as he has and to chance that.  Why is it ballsy, though?  I bet you they got it pretty figured out these days.  There's no guarantee your fucking vessel is.  There's no way to get you.  He was tethered.  But, yeah, of course, they lower him down. 
[01:45:30]  And the thing is vertical.  Okay.  So he's just about standing up in this thing.  It's like a coffin.  Is it that small?  Yeah, it's really small.  Oh, my God.  And it drops down.  It takes quite a few hours to get down to the bottom.  We've got to go slow, right?  Yeah.  And then to come up, what they do is he jettisons some weights.  And the thing kind of shoots up.  It took 70 minutes.  Seven zero minutes. 
[01:46:00]  To come up?  To come up, yeah.  How long did it take him to get down there?  Two and a half hours.  Two and a half hours down, 70 minutes up.  Yeah.  And he was down there for 20 minutes, I guess.  Oh, what a feeling.  Around there.  Just going down, down, down for two and a half hours.  The pressure, they said, is equivalent to three SUVs  on your little, on your big toe.  Really?  Like, that's the amount of weight that the pressure  of all that water being on top of you is pressing on that.  Most people can handle that.  I could take three SUVs on my toe. 
[01:46:30]  Fuck yeah.  You wouldn't have to.  But it's every square inch of your body  has the weight of three SUVs on it.  Oh, okay.  It's not just your toe going, ow, ow.  It's like the entire world sitting on your belly.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'd take.  Three SUVs.  The pressure.  On every toe.  Every inch.  If there's ever a catastrophic failure of that thing,  he would never know.  You'd do it, why?  It would be instantaneous implosion that would,  he wouldn't even feel wet for a second.  No, but he might. 
[01:47:00]  But I'll tell you one thing.  He would hear the, uh-oh.  I think by the time you hear a, it's just,  anything that's compromised on that thing  would just crush it.  Wow, that's pretty amazing.  Imagine if you looked out and saw some guy swimming.  Yeah, the guy's waving, too.  Good evening.  So what is he going to see down there?  He's got a hammer and chisel.  He's coming for your window.  Oh, man, that would suck.  That's like a Twilight Zone episode.  What did he see down there?  One of those weird fucking fish things?  I bet he saw a fish with one of them light hats 
[01:47:30]  that they wear.  They got them light hat fishes.  Yeah.  They do have some weird little life down there.  It's weird because it's totally pitch black.  What's the place he went into?  Is that the crevice you guys were talking about?  Yeah, the Mariana Trench.  Mariana Trench.  It's the deepest point on the earth.  Did he go to the bottom of it?  Huh?  Well, no, they pretty much...  No, you probably know.  I think they mapped all the oceans at this point.  He went to the bottom?  Yeah, right to the bottom.  So he went as low as you can go?  Yep.  Wow.  And he's the only one that ever did it solo. 
[01:48:00]  The other guys that went down there,  it was two guys, and that was back in the 60s.  What a ballsy fuck, man.  Back in the fucking 60s.  Yeah, that is ballsy, man.  I mean, you could say, well, you know,  he's got the technology.  Two biggest films of all time he has.  He's an amazing guy, James Cameron.  Titanic, fucking, yeah.  Avatar.  Yeah.  He really is a fucking...  And aliens.  Don't forget about that.  Right.  Well, most brutal part of Cameron...  You know what?  Let this guy say, because he looked up his shit.  I didn't.  Todd in Harrisburg.  Go ahead, Todd.  Yeah, I was reading that the most brutal thing about the descent is that the capsule is shaped 
[01:48:30]  like a bullet, and in order to get down there as fast as they can to maximize the amount  of time they had on the bottom, it spirals the whole way down.  So he's spinning for two and a half hours going...  Come on.  Is that true?  No fucking way.  Come on.  Is that true?  That can't be.  How the fuck...  Isn't he...  They made it like a bullet, and that spins.  Nah, come on.  Wow.  How is he not extremely fucking dizzy?  How do you spin for two hours?  Two and a half hours.  Must be a very slow spin.  Wow, that's crazy.  Now, maybe you just... 
[01:49:00]  They train astronauts for that shit.  It's at 5,000 RPM.  Wait a minute.  Is that him just...  That's all the room he has?  Yeah.  I guess they make it really narrow, so it's like less...  Less...  I don't...  Likely to implode, or...  Yeah, any...  Any breach in that thing has to be small and very fucking structurally sound.  Like, look at that hatch he's gone through.  It's got to be six inches thick, and he gets in there and gets in a standing position.  I'm not claustrophobic, but...  Oh, that would drive me insane at me. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, you would have to be, right?  Oh, man.  He's probably taking so many test runs in that thing and simulated it, and...  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you going to do, though?  You know?  I want a submarine.  Down there, nothing.  Can we see if it says...  I want a submarine badly.  A submarine?  Yeah, just to tool around and long outside and stuff.  It'd be fun.  Just off the beach.  Nothing crazy.  I remember I said I wanted a kit for one in Popular Mechanics once, and I wanted to build  it.  Wow, that'd be awesome.  I never did.  Never thought I could, anyway.  I would love one of those.  Just tool around in the bays or something.  Just the thought that you would...  Is it a spiral? 
[01:50:00]  Less than 50 feet down.  I just thought that it would break, though, and you'd just sink.  Yeah, but if you're only 50 feet down, you can figure it out.  50 feet, you'd be dead.  If it breaks?  Yeah.  Why?  Let's see.  Wait, let me look at that.  Sam, why is that thing popping up?  I'm trying to see.  It doesn't look like it...  Can spin with all the tatters.  I want to know what he saw.  And when do we get to see what he saw?  He saw.  And what kind of tweets did he have?  He said, uh...  Have arrived. 
[01:50:30]  Something like, uh...  Hitting...  Hitting bottom.  Never felt so good.  Did he say something like that?  Something like that.  Yeah.  It was a dick joke.  It was a joke about, like, when you put your dick in and you feel, um...  That you've hit bottom.  He said, my vessel's all shitty!  My vessel's all silty!  Silty!  Is he up already?  He's back up.  Oh, yeah.  He came up, like, 20 minutes later.  Yeah.  He supposedly spent six hours down there. 
[01:51:00]  Six hours?  He plans to spend.  Oh.  I guess.  Let's see.  Engineered to sink upright and spinning.  Jesus.  Like a bullet fired straight into the Mariana Trench.  The sub can descend about 500 feet a minute.  Wow.  That's pretty fast.  Yeah.  That is fast.  500 feet a minute.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  35,000 is a long...  You forget how far that is.  Oh, man.  Wait.  Just to think you're in that...  Like, think of the big scheme of things and what that must have looked like.  That little tiny dot at the end of a rope. 
[01:51:30]  Just...  Just way the fuck underwater.  Do you feel it spinning, though?  Because I guess you do.  I would assume you'd have to.  How do you fucking stop that?  Yeah.  How fast is it spinning?  Because even a slow spin can get you fucking dizzy.  Yeah.  And then once it's stopped, you know, the fluid in your ears is still...  Fluid.  It's still spinning around, and that's what makes you all dizzy.  You turn your head sideways when that happens, you'll fucking puke.  I wonder how they trained him to stop that.  I bet he wore those little things on his wrist that I used when I was on the carnival cruise. 
[01:52:00]  Maybe he took some Dramamines.  What did he take to fucking stop puking?  That guy's been in the North Atlantic on ships for...  He's probably impervious to any type of motion sickness.  Nobody took nothing.  Balls.  Because he's a real man.  He took testosterone.  He took nothing.  Yeah.  Anybody would get sick.  Even butt-renauts.  Hey, Iraq.  Butt-renauts.  You got a song for us today in honor of James Cameron and his descent?  Uh-oh. 
[01:52:30]  Just thinking if you're thinking like I'm thinking.  Oh, no way.  Are you thinking like I'm thinking today?  No way.  He might.  Let's see.  He might.  No fucking way.  Let's see if we have a match.  Do we have a match today, Iraq?  You can't think all day.  No match today.  Didn't Jimmy sing a fine version of Yellow Submarine?  Oh, God.  Oh, I have.  Yeah, I had that one cute here.  Oh, you did?  Well, that would have been the match.  If that's the name. 
[01:53:00]  Yellow Submarine Sandwich.  Submarine Sandwich.  Submarine Sandwich.  Submarine Sandwich.  Submarine Sandwich.  Submarine Sandwich.  Submarine Sandwich.  Wow.  First attempt in over 50 years, Antzo.  It was the early 60s.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, I would so do that.  I had to be scared out of my fucking mind.  It was way bigger back then. 
[01:53:30]  No images were captured because of the substance.  Oh, okay.  Leaving no visibility.  Leaving no visibility, yeah.  That's why he was lowered, probably.  Yeah, yeah.  They wanted to make sure, you know.  What's he saying?  If you go all the way down there.  Let's make sure.  Cameron Deep Sea Challenger is fully equipped with lights and cameras.  And action.  The 60 descent took five hours.  His is less than two.  He can stay there for hours.  You get a sense of how thick the steel is here in the hatch to withstand the pressure at that depth. 
[01:54:00]  This is the steel sphere here.  This is where the pilot goes.  Pilot.  He is cramped in there.  He has to keep his knees bent and cannot extend his arms.  Oh, fuck.  Wait, he can't move his arms, basically?  Can't extend them.  And the search recovery crew have to find it.  Have to get you out.  You're bolted in.  Wow.  We can't get out. 
[01:54:30]  So we may complete the dive, get all the way back to the surface, and then have a potential hazard at the surface.  Oh, fuck this.  Remember what I just said?  Fuck this.  Can't bend his knees.  Holy fuck.  That looks claustrophobic as all hell.  Of course I'm worried.  Worry is a good thing when you're an explorer.  I think when you're cavalier, when you take risk for granted, that's when you're going to get bit.  No, I think it could just happen, even if you're not cavalier.  I can't breathe.  We know that we're going to see very strange animals. 
[01:55:00]  Like amphipods and holothorians.  Scrimps down there.  Holy shit, motherfucking scrap.  Scrap on the bottom.  That was the bottom of it, right?  Yeah.  Science can't answer one very basic question.  Are there fish?  I like me some of them scrimps.  Maybe not.  Wow.  We're looking at a dropped camera at the bottom.  Yeah, where is this video for the people out there?  We can't just watch videos.  Sure we can.  Where is it?  Astronogeographic.com.  All right, yeah, go there so you can see the videos we're checking out.  How can you grab a fish from there and bring it up? 
[01:55:30]  Can you?  With the pressure, kill it on the way up?  I can't reach out.  No, no, no, no.  I mean, we're in third grade.  I don't think they're going to get a fish.  I love when we go into third grade.  But they do.  They brought up fish on fishing lines from great depths, and they do.  They explode when they come up.  Their eyes pop out of their fucking head.  They're all blown up.  Yeah, they can't take, like, the no-pressure zone up here.  That means you can't eat it.  Tasty, good eating.  Can't eat a fish that exploded.  Would it suck if the fish that cures AIDS is at the bottom of that thing? 
[01:56:00]  And they just can't get it up?  It just keeps blowing up in the ocean.  It's like, damn it.  That was claustrophobic, dude.  Yeah, that looks crazy claustrophobic.  When they said he was bolted in, that's when I was out.  He couldn't extend his legs.  He couldn't extend his arms or bend his knees.  When I saw his arms, I'm like, fuck that.  And he can't get out of it.  Yeah.  I just said he was home.  All right.  He's just stuck forever.  Let's break it down.  Ready?  Yeah.  You're in that position.  Yeah.  You're descending.  You're a panic attack.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, you get a cramp in your calf.  One of those middle-of-the-night fucking cramps that wake up and can't sleep, and you can't 
[01:56:30]  fucking do shit.  Oh, my God.  James, what's the matter?  Ah!  Oh, my God.  Ah, crap.  What, are you going to piss?  Oh, man.  I would just piss my pants.  Oh, they just probably got it set up.  Yeah, fuck that.  One of those fucking, you're pissing a fucking thing that's around your dick.  What did you say?  You can piss in three hours.  You're pissing a diaper.  For discovery reasons, I'd pee my pants.  No problem.  But you know what?  No problem.  So, you ever get, like, in a nervous situation, and you pee?  You have to pee?  He would be, I'd be like, oh, I just pissed. 
[01:57:00]  They bolt me in the thing.  Two seconds later, I'd be like, I gotta piss.  Or he gets that nervous shit.  Oh, nervous shit.  He's really got a shit.  Oh, imagine, like, all of a sudden, you know those shits that just go, grr, come out  of nowhere?  Yeah.  What if he's doing that?  Imagine gassing in there.  Oh.  I'd love to be in there with him and cut a few farts.  Like, drop a nice egg fart and close the thing.  Oh, man.  Have a good trip.  The thing would probably last, like, when they open that hatch.  You'd probably smell it as pristine as it was when it first came out of the ass.  I want to ruin his trip to the bottom of the ocean with one of my farts. 
[01:57:30]  That's right.  Jim can't be a scientist, because he'd bolt him in with some farts.  With farts.  Yeah, right before he closed the hatch.  Yeah, take this with you.  Bolt it.  Opie's V on Twitter writes, they can light the Mariana, Mariana, right?  Yeah.  Trench, but not the O&A studio.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's true, see?  The light jokes might go away soon, though.  Lights.  Yeah, I'm getting you some.  We might have figured out the lights, finally.  I like that there's a Twitter user named Opie's V.  I don't.  I don't like it at all.  That's hot. 
[01:58:00]  No, it's not.  It's fucking hot.  I'm going to follow that one.  You fuck.  There's a picture of it on his Twitter.  Holy shit.  Someone should start Jim Norton's sweater, because Jim Norton's wearing a lot of sweaters  these days.  I really have been.  The Titanic.  You lost weight, Jimmy.  Thank you.  The Weight Watchers is working for you.  Thank you.  That's fucked up.  Not that I noticed or anything.  That's right if you look at my body.  Wow, it just goes like that.  Oh, there's a sign down there that says, Welcome to Challenger Deep.  No, that's what the website is saying.  That was very nice of them, to put a sign down there for James Cameron.  6,000 feet. 
[01:58:30]  The Titanic is at 12,000.  Would you take a...  So that's fucking three times as deep.  Would you take a glass elevator to the bottom of the ocean floor?  Oh, it would crush in a second.  Yeah, I'd probably go, hey, stop here.  I'm going to get off and buy some girdles.  I'd say, yeah, every 10 feet down, I would go, floor five, shoes, hats, and gloves, ladies'  foundations, and other picture postcards.  Floor 36,277. 
[01:59:00]  Same joke over and over with different things.  Where did I park my car?  It's a parking garage.  Get it?  I would say, boy, this elevator sure the heck is taking quite a long time.  I hope no one pushes all the buttons on the way back up.  Oh, I know.  Stopping at every depth.  Yeah, this is like going up into the plane, but going down into the ocean.  Where's the clouds and stuff?  Oh, you're funny.  I would just do all kinds of little jokes.  Up, where's the whales on the sonar and not? 
[01:59:30]  Imagine if a whale just rolled by and fucking...  And clipped that...  Or a shark saw those fucking ropes and thought they looked delicious.  Like somebody didn't realize that whatever coached those fucking tether ropes is a shark  aphrodisiac.  What about an octopus just hugging you?  Fuck.  And wouldn't let go.  But it wrecks everything.  Like, it doesn't break anything, but it just sits on the window.  I just want some contact.  It wasn't even trying to be evil.  Yeah.  It blocks all the cameras.  He's never seen anybody. 
[02:00:00]  He just wants a hug.  Right.  Yeah, you go down there and it's like, what the fuck?  Cuts off your oxygen.  He reaches in and you feel his octopus tentacles entering your asshole and you can't move.  You're like, hey, what the hub?  Wow.  Now you're just sitting on the bottom.  Can you imagine just hanging out?  Yeah.  It's showing the light.  Is there a cave down there?  I guess there is.  Wow.  There's all sorts of shit.  I'd love to go cave diving under there.  That's craziness.  Sure would.  Hey, cave diving.  What are you doing?  Craziness.  See, the Earth's crust is born in the Pacific region off the coast of California and then 
[02:00:30]  it pushes towards Asia and the two plates where they meet, one plate goes under the  other plate and that's what made that giant trench.  It was all that just pushy, pushy.  Amazing.  What the Earth is constantly moving.  Yeah, it pushed it down.  And that's why there's a ridge where it actually comes out of and a valley where it goes back 
[02:01:00]  in and California will someday be right against Japan.  Really?  Yeah.  You think the center...  Maybe next week.  I don't know.  You think the center of the Earth is really hot?  Oh, let's journey to it.  Yeah, it sure is.  I'd light a ciggy down there in a second.  You can bet.  Quick, get me a Benson and Hedges.  I see the core.  Go ahead.  You're true.  Benson and Hedges.  Old lady cigarette.  Where's my Chesterfields?  Yeah.  Quick, get me a moor.  I see the big circle of fire.  I'm smoking. 
[02:01:30]  Well, you got to give him credit.  I mean, what a set of bulls.  You have all that.  The guy lives in fucking palatial mansions.  Makes very popular motion pictures.  And he feels compelled to go underwater a lot.  Titanic.  Yeah.  I think they're doing that Titanic special on April...  Is it 8th or 10th?  Enough with that boat.  Yeah, enough.  Are you tired of the Titanic?  Stop already.  Sam, can I see the video?  He's got half the video showing, and he's showing the...  Shut up. 
[02:02:00]  I'll spit on you.  Ah, back to the Titanic.  Ah.  Toot-dee-doo.  Remember how romanticized everybody was with the Titanic when that movie came out?  Sure.  And it was like at the same time all the pictures were coming up from the real Titanic, and it  was all very romantic.  Now everyone's just like, all right, without the romanticizing, it just shows the pile  of fucking rust and shit that's down there. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Cares.  Should we have a leg?  Yeah.  Shouldn't we have a hotel down there by now?  Oh, my goodness.  Come on.  What are we doing with our technology?  I don't think they even want people going down there anymore.  Why?  Because they've disturbed a lot of the...  Who cares if you can't see it?  Who cares if it's disturbed?  Exactly.  Right?  We look at it and disturb it.  That's what humans do.  The only people that are disturbing it are the people that are down there that see it.  Right.  So give people the opportunity to see it before it completely goes away.  What are they saving it for? 
[02:03:00]  It is rotting very quickly, they say.  Is it?  Yeah, it's rusting.  A lot of rust.  How much longer until it just disappears?  I don't know.  I wonder.  I don't really wonder.  I just said that.  Is it possible to raise it or it would fall apart?  No, it's very fragile.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's a big pile of rusted shit.  Even when they send some of these remote vehicles in there and it hits like the edge of something,  giant chunks of rust fall off.  It can't take, like, anything.  Oh.  Game.  Yeah, the little blow-up toys at the fairs. 
[02:03:30]  Why don't they go down there and just lift it up with a bunch of ropes?  Just pick it up.  Push it.  It's like, it's underwater.  Everything's lighter than that.  Suck all the water out of the area.  Build a giant, like, uh, what do you call it?  A gurney or something?  Gurney.  You're in gurney.  Yeah.  I had a dream last night that my ex was blowing me and I caught a silent gasser and I was so  embarrassed that she was blowing me and I farted.  So I pulled her up and started making out with her and then she just blew me and then  she's like, I could smell your fart the whole time.  I was so embarrassed. 
[02:04:00]  There was your dream?  You dream things like that?  You bet I do.  That's hilarious.  Why would you dream that?  I don't know.  What's that, Sam?  That's one of the beautiful staterooms in the Titanic.  That's a small room, right?  Where someone drowned.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Jesus.  Titanic's in 3D now, right?  Why don't they just fucking remake the Titanic?  They're working on the 3D.  Yeah?  Ah, they got the 3D.  I think it's going to be 3D.  They'll do the 3D.  Look at that, yeah.  It's coming out in a couple weeks.  Enough with that fucking movie. 
[02:04:30]  Is that an actual photo or is that a mock-up?  That's a photo.  Photo.  But I mean, of the real Titanic?  Sure.  You ever touch the Titanic?  No.  How?  When we were living in Boston, they had a little display where you could touch Titanic shit.  They want to touch it.  Oh.  Yeah, they had like...  What do they sacrifice?  They sacrifice a piece where everyone gets to touch it.  Yeah.  So you're like, fuck, I'm touching something that was at the bottom of the ocean.  It's a little piece of steel that you're going to touch.  What was it?  I forget.  I don't think it's a toilet seat.  That shit traveled around the country, but it was a cool exhibit. 
[02:05:00]  Do you remember like the pickles and shit that were still in their jars and all that?  Were they really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They had all this stuff that looked pretty damn pristine from the Titanic.  Pickles.  Well, who's going to eat it?  That's true.  Fish doesn't have thumbs.  You know how hard those jars ought to open?  They had the dramatic, what was it, a clock or something that stopped exactly when you  hit the water.  Yeah.  All the plates.  The white star line plates.  They had the plates and stuff, but they were in really good shape.  White star line.  Is a plate from Titanic worth a lot of money?  I would assume they're probably worth a lot of fucking money, yeah. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  White star line was the ship company?  Yeah.  They only brought up...  Fucking racist.  They brought up, like, plates and cups and shit like that, and I think a lot of people  were getting pissed, though, that they were kind of pilfering from what people conceive  of as a grave.  It's like grave robbing.  But the pickles...  Not if it's a plate.  Yeah.  If it was someone's fucking dentures, then...  Yeah.  Who cares?  Fuck them with the bottom of the ocean.  Now, with a pickle...  Could you eat a pickle after a hundred years?  Jimmy, fuck them. 
[02:06:00]  I bet you could.  It's so violent.  Jimmy's question is, could you eat the pickle?  How long?  Wow.  I'd love to have a Titanic pickle sandwich.  Hold the relish, darling.  This is the last one of its kind.  Quick, get a white star line plate.  I'm dying for some pickles.  Hold the relish on a pickle sandwich?  I'm going to have a little bit of pickle with a side of pickle juice.  Get a star line plate.  I'm starving.  I'm famished.  Oh, shit.  Can we go make wee wee?  I'd like to break those pickles. 
[02:06:30]  One of a kind.  Yeah.  Just break the jar of pickles on the floor and sweep it up like it's just...  Yeah.  Some classics.  Yeah.  Let's wee wee.  Oh, wee wee time?  Wee wee.  My goodness.  A little more radio.  Donald Sutherland.  And then we start our Monday.  That's what I say.  Oh, we got a really good beer clip after the break.  Beer?  And one of our favorites.  It's his birthday today.  And I'm surprised Ann hasn't picked up on it yet.  What?  That's a dumb little tease.  Oh.  For the people who still appreciate a good radio tease. 
[02:07:00]  I don't know.  Okay.  I look forward to saying whose birthday it is just to hear something from you, sir.  All righty.  That's all I'll say.  I'll play along.  All righty.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opinion Anthony Show.  In the middle of the earth, in the land of Shire, lives a brave little hobbit whom we all admire.  With his long wooden pipe, fuzzy woolly toes, he lives in a hobbit hole and everybody knows him. 
[02:07:30]  Bilbo, Bilbo Baggins, he's only three feet tall.  Bilbo, Bilbo Baggins, the bravest little hobbit of them all.  Now hobbits are peace-loving folks, you know.  They're never in a hurry and they take things slow.  They don't like to travel away from home.  They don't like to travel away from home. 
[02:08:00]  Travel?  Is this right?  Sure is.  Who's singing this?  Leonard Nimoy.  Who is 81 years old today.  81.  Leonard Nimoy.  And of course, once again, Anthony ruined the movie for everybody.  The Star Trek movie was great.  The new Star Trek.  Who is this song?  By 1942.  Oh, my God.  There's a video to it.  Oh, God.  Why is he singing this?  And I guess it was done when he was filming Star Trek because he's got the Spock hair. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  You would think he would moose it up a little bit.  Yeah, something.  Just to change it a little bit.  Oh, they're wearing Spock ears.  Oh, wait.  No, those are hobbit ears.  Oh, boy.  This is going to get stuck in my fucking head.  Turn it off.  Wow, this is bad.  Turn it off.  Oh, it has that groovy 65.  Oh, it really is 60.  This video is horrifically 60s. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, it has to be.  La, la, la, la, la.  Why didn't Peter Jackson use this in the movie?  It would have been great.  Maybe he will use it in The Hobbit.  Yeah, okay.  This is when he was doing the original of Spock?  Yeah.  Yeah, because he's got the hair.  La, la, la, la.  Bilbo.  Bilbo.  Bilbo. 
[02:09:30]  Bilbo.  Bilbo Baggins.  That's terrible.  A dildo.  Dildo Figgins.  Logan, thank you.  Yeah, Leonard Nimoy 81.  So there you go.  Ah.  Good for him.  Good singer.  With his dentures.  Almost sounds Tom Brokaw-ish, but he kind of does now.  You just ruined his frame.  Live long and prosper.  Since my usual farewell would be a bit self-serving. 
[02:10:00]  It doesn't say you always were my friend.  Yeah.  You, I shall be, I am and shall always be your friend.  I shall always, will be and your shall's friend.  Let me see it.  Oh, God.  There are so few Vulcans left.  There are so few Vulcans left.  We can not afford to ignore each other.  Oh.  Then why did you send Kirk aboard when you alone could have explained the truth? 
[02:10:30]  Because you needed each other.  Because you needed each other.  The revelation of all that you could accomplish together.  Of a friendship that will define you both.  In ways you cannot yet realize.  Realize.  How did you persuade him to keep your secret?  He inferred that universe and...  Live long and polydent.  Should he break his promise?  Oh, it sounds terrible.  Promise.  Like to see him just go thong.  They just fly out of his mouth.  And out of faith. 
[02:11:00]  One I hope that you will repeat in the future is Starfleet.  For sure.  In the face of extinction, it is only logical I resign my Starfleet commission and help rebuild our race.  Exactly.  And yet you can be in two places at once.  Once.  I urge you to remain in Starfleet.  I have already located a suitable planet on which to establish a Vulcan colony.  Oh, it sounds awful.  Those tensions are ready to fly out of his head.  Do yourself a favor.  Put aside logic.  Do what feels right.  Feels right. 
[02:11:30]  You think he has bad breath?  Oh my god.  What are they in there with?  A screw?  A loose screw.  I shall simply say, good luck.  Yes.  Good luck.  Oh, because my normal thing would be self-service.  That's fine.  Yes.  Live long and prosper.  Well, you know.  That movie was fucking great.  It really was.  God damn movie.  It was fucking great.  I'm not a Star Trek fan and I loved it.  Bill Bull Baggins. 
[02:12:00]  Oh my goodness.  No, we got to play a clip before Donald Sutherland.  Hello, Christopher.  Like the villain in that?  He was just all fucking.  You got to text that Donald Sutherland's here yet?  Oh, is he?  He's pulling up?  All right, good.  What's your favorite Donald Sutherland movie?  Let's go around the room.  I would go with Animal House.  Animal House.  I really enjoyed the remake in the 70s of Invasion of the Body Snatches.  I loved him.  I believe it was. 
[02:12:30]  I forgot he was in that.  Oh, it was great.  I loved him in JFK and I loved him in Little Murders.  It was 71, but he's great in that.  Yeah, he's very funny.  Where he goes, where he's on the phone in Invasion of the Body Snatches.  I found a buddy.  I found a buddy.  A buddy?  What are you talking about?  Let's not forget that deeply depressing movie, Ordinary People.  Ordinary People, where he's married to that fucking bitch.  That bitch.  Mary Tyler Moore.  And of course, Kelly's Heroes.  That's right.  He was in Kelly's Heroes.  The Tank guy.  A fucking movie they show a lot. 
[02:13:00]  Yes, yes.  They love that movie on Sundays in the middle of winter.  Yeah, yes, they do.  Kelly's Heroes.  Boy, that was star-studded.  Yes, Mr. Rock?  And the original M.A.S.H.  Yes, he was in the movie M.A.S.H.  That's weird.  He's Hawkeye Pierce.  But no one acknowledges that.  We all just know the TV show.  We're not going to bring that one up.  That was a case where the show was more popular than the movie.  Correct the movie.  Yes.  Any other examples of that?  Any, any?  What?  Seinfeld? 
[02:13:30]  Friday Night Lights.  Okay, look.  I'm talking show people watch.  Yeah, but the people who watch that really love it.  I've never seen it, but I know it was really, you know, well-received.  Fair enough.  You take something of that magnitude.  He was great in A Time to Kill, too.  Oh, okay.  I'll give him that one.  Yes, Mr. Rock?  Another example in a Donald Sutherland movie, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  All right.  Very good.  Very good.  Yes, indeed.  Wow, look at you.  The show bigger than the movie.  Weird Science.  Weird. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, boy.  Was he in it?  No, but it was a short-lived USA show.  Oh, God.  Lee Turgesson was in it, though.  Turd Ferguson?  Oh, from Oz.  Turd Ferguson.  It's not my name.  Turd Ferguson.  Does anyone know what Norm MacDonald's doing?  Alice?  Why is he live-tweeting golf?  I don't know, but I have to hide him every time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Every Saturday.  But what's the bit there?  Is there a bit there?  No.  He wants to be a golf announcer.  Huh?  He just really likes golf.  There's no joke there.  It's no bit. 
[02:14:30]  Norm MacDonald.  He live-tweets golf, which I kind of...  Like he's an announcer.  I kind of appreciate it, because I was out and about yesterday, but I was like, holy fuck.  It's way too much.  Hundreds of tweets on golf in one day.  I think he's kidding.  I don't know.  I don't know what the bit is.  I don't know.  Sometimes you don't know what the bit is.  He's a wanky guy.  Oh, he was also in Rain or Me.  How do you know my name?  I love that.  Calls up.  What happened?  Yes, Mr. Bunnell.  We'll be right there.  I didn't give you my name.  How do you know my name? 
[02:15:00]  From what movie?  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  I got to watch that damn movie.  That's a good one.  I haven't seen it in a while.  Yeah.  I'm out.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm fucking out on that one.  You want a beer clip before he gets here?  Yes.  Here's a beer clip.  Man, I can't believe y'all got to be up here authorizing.  People to do alcoholic beverage in their house.  Beer, we sell it now not good enough.  How are you going to make it in your home if you don't have the facility to make sure it's healthy?  What does M-E-A-D need? 
[02:15:30]  What is that?  How are you going to keep your kids from becoming wine owners?  When I have a cocktail, I drink Chevy's Regal.  Chevy's Regal is stamped and approved by the government agencies that said this is healthy.  But you think I'll drink something that was made at somebody's house?  Man, you're going to make everybody up there wine over.  Now, that's the same guy.  Are you sure?  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  That's the same guy from Milo? 
[02:16:00]  That's why we gave you the clip.  No, I thought you gave it to me because it's funny no matter what.  It's the same guy.  The original guy?  Yeah.  The only to be a wee guy.  Holy fuck, look at this guy.  Oh, man.  Donald Sutherland.  Look at fucking Hollywood royalty walking down the hall.  Oh, man.  I don't want to look.  Oh, my God.  He's got really long, like, gray hair and a beard.  Holy fuck, look at Donald Sutherland, man.  Oh, man.  Okay.  Okay, let's all be cool.  Let's all be cool.  Donald fucking Sutherland.  Let's not be too starstruck.  Jimmy, you all right?  I'll handle this well.  He's got his luggage. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's rolling past with it.  He's gone.  He just flipped Jimmy the bird.  He just went by us and gave us the finger.  That's funny.  He just flipped the bird.  He went around the corner and gave us the middle finger.  Oh, shit.  What the hell was that about?  What is he doing?  He's in Al-Q right now.  What's that?  He walked into the Al-Q studio.  I guess he was supposed to do us first. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, he's coming back.  But he walked by.  I don't think he knows where he's going.  Well, bring him in.  No, they're trying to figure it out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's people trying to figure it out.  He's his own guy.  Oh, that's hilarious.  He just gave us the finger.  He's just like, whatever.  That's great.  He's got his Donald Sutherland luggage on.  He's taking off his trench coat.  Okay.  Okay.  He's got to go to the restroom.  What happened?  He's got to go to the restroom.  Well, what are we supposed to do?  Look at those locks.  Long, white hair.  Yes, white.  Hello.  Hi, how are you? 
[02:17:30]  Wow.  Who are you?  What's up, Roland?  How are you?  You all right, Roland?  What?  What's the matter?  You all right?  Oh, you got your Jets shirt on for Tim Tebow?  You got a Tebow ready?  He's got a Tebow, Jeremy.  What are you putting that right there for?  Why is it all scratched up?  Two cameras shoot.  So I could be on some camera, too.  Did you age it?  No, it's just a, um, you did so fast when you watch it.  There's a camera over there, too, Jimmy.  Look.  Cameras all over the fucking place.  Oh, Jesus.  Everyone's got, what, what, uh, Roland?  It's like a camera factory in here or something. 
[02:18:00]  What?  I ain't moving shit.  Ah, damn.  You figure it out.  No, it's just when they rush to do their shirts, it's just going to make them that way.  I can't go, what, like that?  Perfect.  It looks better, but if you don't want to.  Yeah, but I can't.  Not that I have to say is important.  He's not Donald Sutherland.  Why does it got to face that way?  You put it over there, but don't put it right, but this guy's sitting right here.  Put it, like, over there by that monitor and aim it up so you can get past the thing.  The thing you do.  There you go.  Just make sure you're pointed.  That's the wall.  That's the...  He's just fucking with you. 
[02:18:30]  Roland, what?  Oh, no, I just said they rush to do their shirts, and if they did, they need to use good  material.  The next batch will be better.  What, they're using shitty material just to get the shirts out?  Of course.  No.  Yes.  Sort of ironic, isn't it?  Well, yeah, because that's why they charge 35 bucks, and you go, Tebow!  35 bucks.  Today, I got one high five, and then on Saturday, they go, Tebow, and I turn around, and they  go, you're an asshole for buying it.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  A lot of excitement with the Tebow.  I'm excited for Tebow.  What do you think?  What do you think?  I'm happy I'm going to go to Jets games this season, so... 
[02:19:00]  Well, you always go to Jets games, no matter what.  I know, but now it'll be fun to just chant Tebow.  It'll be fun to just chant Tebow.  And then when he's on the field, you go, Sanchez, Sanchez.  Oh, that is kind of funny.  Okay.  You're going to fuck it up?  I'll do that.  Sanchez is going to get a little nervous.  With Tebow on the sidelines with the clipboard.  What happened now?  He talks what?  I just seen...  Who talks?  You do.  He's just directing.  What's going on? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, here's Donald Sutherland.  All right.  Bring him in, man.  Wow.  Look at him.  Yay.  He's got his suspenders on and a tie.  He's bringing his luggage in.  I wouldn't leave my Donald Sutherland luggage around.  Oh, my God.  This could be interesting.  What?  There's a discussion going on.  He's a good guy?  Yeah.  What's the discussion about?  I don't know.  What are they talking about?  I don't know.  What are they talking about, Roland?  I don't know.  Why?  The Roland...  His acting is getting worse and worse.  I know.  Roland is panicking.  As the years go by. 
[02:20:00]  Panicky Pete Roland.  Ah, Donald Sutherland.  What kind of microphones are these?  Hello, sir.  I don't know.  What are they?  What kind of microphones?  Probably cheap ones for this company.  Sure.  Very cheap.  This company isn't known for...  Can I have a U87?  Exactly.  See?  He's a guy that knows his stuff.  Why are you carrying your own luggage?  You're making everyone nervous.  You're rolling your own luggage, sir.  I am?  Yes.  The mics do work better when you pull them in front of you.  You smell really good. 
[02:20:30]  Does he smell good?  Oh, he smells great.  Yeah.  What does he smell like, Jimmy?  Just really good cologne.  Like very clean.  Yeah.  You smell good.  Like success.  I'm sitting beside someone who can't tell the difference between perfume and flatulence.  I see them as one and the same.  You smell great.  I really appreciate that you guys have water and tea and all that stuff.  It's nice.  And why wouldn't you?  Do you want something?  I have no idea why I don't, but just no one else.  We do have water.  That is your water.  Do you want something else, sir?  I'd love a cup of black tea. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Please rock.  We'll get some black tea.  Wow.  You do smell good.  Yeah.  Man.  It's just permeating the room.  Yes.  I like it.  Thank God.  This place stinks.  It's success and it's a successful movie.  That's what it is.  Everybody came out.  You know, the Twitter feeds all said it was an A, an A plus.  Yeah.  Which is great, you know, because an exit poll nowadays can kill a movie.  And this one is just, but it's, people keep saying, you know, I don't want to go see it.  It's a movie for kids.  It's not a movie for kids. 
[02:21:30]  It's a movie for adults.  It's living up to the hype, too.  Like a lot of times, like you're saying, if you pre-hype a movie, there's nowhere to go but  down from there.  But what an opening weekend.  This one's got everywhere to go up.  Yeah.  You know, there's a movie for the 99%.  It has a chance.  When I read the script, I didn't know anything about the books.  When I read the script, I said, my God, this could allow young people to feel that they  can determine their destiny.  You know, and it's great.  Do you feel when a movie's this successful that, would you rather have a successful movie 
[02:22:00]  monetarily or something that you really are happy with and proud of doing?  I'm happy with this and I'm proud of doing it.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  It's like, it's amazing you got both as far as this is concerned.  And if it can, if it can in some way organize young people, you know, it's been a pretty  dormant generation.  I just, I read the other day the Port Huron statement that the SDS produced in 1962, 50 years 
[02:22:30]  ago.  It was wonderful.  And we have nothing like that today.  The SDS?  SDS.  I know what that means, but they don't.  What is it?  Students for a democratic society.  Oh, SDS.  I got the wrong letters.  You said SDS.  No, DS stands for Donald Sutherland.  Who booked me into this?  Exactly.  Look at him.  Can we, we, uh, were you, were you very active, uh, growing up as far as, uh, social growing 
[02:23:00]  up?  Yeah.  I, I, I, I, you know, I grew kind of a foot a year.  Oh, see that because he is tall.  No, he's very tall.  Politically.  No.  I was, I was, no, I'm, I'm from Nova Scotia.  Yeah.  You're Nova Scotia, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, Canadian.  Where men are men and sheep are afraid of us.  Are you a Canadian?  No, but I have, uh, friends that are Canadians.  No, so we're not fellow Canadians.  Did you hate the way he tried to bond with you on that and then you realized he's from  Long Island?  Our neighbors to the north.  Yeah, I'm just from Long Island.  That was creepy.  Are you from Canada? 
[02:23:30]  Really?  You too?  No, Long Island.  Well, one of their glaciers ran over Long Island.  If I could try to put the connection there somewhere.  You know, Hunger Games, third best opening weekend of all time, should be mentioned  while Donald Sutherland's in the studio.  That includes franchises.  That includes Harry Potter 2 and one other one.  I can't remember which one it is.  It's the, it's the best opening weekend.  That wasn't a franchise.  Or a sequel.  No, a sequel, yeah.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  This is not yet a franchise until the second one comes out. 
[02:24:00]  $155 million so far.  That's pretty good.  Hope you got a piece of that.  You got a piece of the action?  Well.  Okay, really a downer, right?  No.  I may, when John Landis, he had been a gopher on Kelly's Heroes.  Oh, he was?  Did you want me to tell it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't want to spoil it.  No, I know the Animal House story.  That's what I mean.  Okay, sorry.  He was a gopher on Kelly's Heroes.  Oh, wow.  I didn't know that.  And MASH came out when I was over in Yugoslavia, and he said, okay, I'm going to be a great director.  I said, well, if you're going to be a director, I'll be in every film. 
[02:24:30]  So I was in Kentucky Fried Movie and all that kind of thing, just playing a waiter or whatever.  And I was shooting Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and he said, come over up to Eugene, Oregon,  and do a day on this, playing a professor who smokes dope.  And I said, okay.  He said, Universal wants to offer you 2% of the profit.  I said, Universal, 2%?  No.  Oh, no.  I said, they need to pay me my daily rate. 
[02:25:00]  So they did.  2% of Animal House, huh?  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Well, you know.  Forget about the Neumann U87.  Do you know, what would 2% roughly have translated into?  Do you have any estimate?  Have you just tried to block it?  I just want to know.  If the figure 2 million comes into your mind.  Yeah, yeah.  I would think it would probably be a lot of money.  Were you surprised in 80 when ordinary people beat Raging Bull for Best Picture, or did you  kind of feel like it was going to? 
[02:25:30]  I don't think about those kind of things, to be truthful.  I mean, Marty's movie was wonderful.  Bobby was fantastic in it.  It just appeals to a different audience.  It's that year Jack Lemmon won Best Actor.  And De Niro won for Raging Bull.  Well, then that wasn't the same year, because the same year, oh, maybe, I don't know, Jack  won, maybe it was. 
[02:26:00]  Redford won Director for Ordinary People, and Ordinary People won Best Picture, and I think  De Niro won Best Actor.  Oh, did he?  Okay.  Why are you arguing with Donaldson?  Oh, I'm not.  I'm helping.  Oh, my goodness.  He's helping me.  I'm 76 years old.  I need whatever I can get, and I want to thank you very much for the tea.  Yeah, yeah.  Still making it.  We told him, I told him, have water and tea ready, and they just don't do it.  We have the water, but no tea.  I just keep trying to pass the water to him.  Here comes the tea right now.  Oh, is that his tea?  I bet it's in a plastic cup.  It better.  I think it's in.  Is that his tea? 
[02:26:30]  Yes.  A real tea.  No, it's in a plastic cup.  Don't spill it.  Can you believe it?  It's in a Starbucks.  It should be in the bone cup.  You're trying to poison me, yeah.  But it's in the bone cup, Barbara.  Do you prefer a glass to drink your tea out of her?  Because I know Bill Cosby likes to drink out of a glass.  Anything.  Anything other than plastic or paper.  Oh, boy.  We are screwing up by the numbers here today.  Oh, no.  I'm just being a complaining old...  No.  It's a fantastic movie.  Yes.  Jennifer Lawrence.  I said somewhere that she should be called Jennifer Lawrence Olivier.  She's just a great actor. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  And Gary is a brilliant writer.  Those scenes in the Rose Garden in the movie, did you see the movie?  I have not seen the movie yet.  We couldn't get tickets.  It was sold out all weekend.  We could not get tickets.  It's the big city, New York.  Kind of hard to...  Yeah.  Same sort, though.  We're going to see it.  Swear.  He's going to kill us.  I've seen every Donald Sutherland movie.  You've seen almost everyone.  You haven't seen this.  I haven't seen Little Murders.  Little Murders.  Little Murders.  Little Murders.  What a great film.  But the odds are not good. 
[02:27:30]  Very, very funny movie.  But the look he's given us, I got to tell you, we live in Manhattan.  We could not go see this movie.  And they won't give us a screener copy, obviously.  It was sold out the entire weekend.  They won't give us copies, which some films do, but films of this size never give out screeners.  No.  So we couldn't see it ahead of time.  They don't give out screeners because there's so much problem with...  Pirating horror.  All I'm saying is we want to see the movie before we got here.  What are these video cameras doing?  Because otherwise I would have dressed.  You look terrific.  You look great.  Wonderful.  Seriously.  Do you look great? 
[02:28:00]  I think it's...  What do they do with that?  We just videotape every interview.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Turn those cameras off.  What do they do with it?  No, no, no.  I don't know.  I just needed to know.  I don't know.  Okay.  All right.  Great pleasure being on you.  Do you like...  Little Murders was 71.  No one had talked about it.  Like, you know, I mean, back then they did.  But it's such a fucking great underrated comedy.  Yeah.  It's a great movie.  Alan.  Gosh, he was funny. 
[02:28:30]  Who?  Elliot Gould?  No, no, no.  Elliot, you know, Alan, when he directed it.  Oh, I don't know who directed it.  Vincent Gardinia's in it.  And Donald just plays, like, this really weird...  I play a minister.  Hippie minister.  Everybody's...  No, he's very straight.  Well, it was...  But it was bizarre for that movie, maybe.  It's maybe...  Because it kind of seemed like it was the juxtaposition of him to Vincent Gardinia.  It was supposed to be kind of like a shocking presence.  Little Murders was a Jules Feiffer script.  Yeah.  It was funny.  Well, now I've got to see that.  I know.  Now I've got to see Hunger Games and that. 
[02:29:00]  Carol, I've never heard that name on a man before.  You were just fantastic.  That and JFK are my two favorite Sutherland monologue moments.  Oh, yeah.  That is it.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah.  By the way, a lot of people try to help you out, Donald.  They know how much money you would have made from monologues.  Oh, no.  JFK.  That's no help.  JFK took three months to prepare.  For that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it was whatever it was, 20 minutes, 20-minute monologue.  Wow.  And you can't memorize it.  I mean, you could memorize it and just say the words. 
[02:29:30]  But to make it real, you have to have it so profoundly absorbed that you can answer a telephone in the middle and then go right back to what you're saying because it's in your head like it's really in your head.  Is that what you did?  Did you research everything and just until you knew it backwards and forwards and then just kind of speak it out?  No, but I mean, I had done a lot of the research earlier because I had produced a film called Executive Action, which was about that.  And Fletcher Prouty was somebody that I admired and believed in. 
[02:30:00]  And, yeah, anyway.  Well, he was the guy.  Wasn't it based, your character actually was based on two people.  It was based on Fletcher and somebody else.  Go see The Hunger Games.  It's a wonderful movie.  It really is.  It's a wonderful movie for adults.  He's a promoting machine.  No, I'm not a promoting machine.  That's why he's here.  It's just that I researched what?  No, I'm saying was X based on Fletcher and somebody else or somebody else?  No, Fletcher.  Fletcher Prouty was there.  Oh. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, you know.  Fletcher and Oliver Stone.  Oliver Stone has a piece of everything.  People actually are compelled with you and that movie and stuff.  So I think it does.  And JFK.  Yeah, people are interested in, you know, your other movies.  Because he told something.  And when he told it, you listened to him.  Yeah.  I was just there for one day.  I came and went.  Well, it's one of those parts that kind of stand out.  It's kind of the same as this.  Yeah, yeah.  Here you come.  You go.  But not quite leaving the brilliance on that film. 
[02:31:00]  So I'm failing here.  No, we don't.  No, no.  It's all right.  I can take exception.  We're failing you.  No, no.  Please.  It's wonderful.  In that monologue, but that is what, that kind of summed up everything everybody felt  about that whole assassination and that monologue.  The rest of the movie was great, even though I think Oswald did it.  But I think that that monologue was fucking summed up what everybody thought about.  It's not whether or not Oswald did it.  It's whether what was behind Oswald doing it.  That's kind of just the window dressing. 
[02:31:30]  Keep the people guessing.  It's like a parlor game.  You're doing lines at Don Sutherland?  I can't help it.  It's Don Sutherland.  Way too late, guys.  Way too late.  Hunger Games, though.  See that.  Really.  Of course.  That's what we're talking about.  I can't wait to see this one.  Do you pay attention to the criticism or the positive reviews that a film like this gets?  Or do you not care what people say either way?  Or does it bother you and make you feel great?  Are you going to say something bad?  No.  No, no, no.  No, it's okay.  No, not at all.  It's okay.  No, it's okay.  Because you were saying the Twitter stuff was really positive. 
[02:32:00]  The Twitter stuff, that's just exit polls.  That's people coming out of the movie saying, I loved it.  And that's wonderful.  That means something.  Because nowadays in this modern society, people coming out of a movie saying, this one sucks.  It just kills it.  Suddenly, the rest of the weekend goes in the toilet.  And this one was never, ever projected to be 155.  Max, it was thought maybe 138.  Wow.  It just went through the roof. 
[02:32:30]  That's got to make you happy.  Did you read the book to prepare?  You said you read the script.  But then did you read the book to learn more about your character?  Or did you say no?  No, I didn't want to know it.  You didn't want to?  Of course I read it.  Oh.  I just told him I spent three months preparing for this monologue.  For 20 minutes.  I thought you meant for JFK.  I thought you meant for JFK.  He did.  You meant for JFK, didn't you?  No, he did.  No.  I meant for Hunger Games.  Oh, I thought you meant for JFK.  You said you spent three months preparing for that monologue to absorb everything.  Yeah, I know.  But you were just asking me if I read the book about Hunger Games. 
[02:33:00]  Or did you maybe want to make character decisions that you didn't want to know what the book said  because you couldn't bring that in?  Or did you want to?  I didn't know.  That's why I asked.  You guys really are very brave.  Why are we brave?  I'm going to sit with him all this time.  No, you know, this is, how many, 30 million people have read this book?  Wow.  This is a movie in the imaginations of 30 million people.  And 30 million people are going to be happy with the movie that Gary Ross has made. 
[02:33:30]  But to be a part of their imagination, obviously I had to read the book that their imaginations movie was based on.  I was just afraid if I said, did you enjoy the book, you would yell at me and go, I didn't read the book.  Why would I read the book?  I'm playing the part.  See, you screwed up, Jimmy.  I don't know.  I really, there's no good answer here.  That's what we're all finding out.  It's no winning.  How did I upset one of my favorite people?  I don't think so.  No.  No, I'm in love with you.  I didn't know how to bring it up.  I think it wouldn't be an opportunity. 
[02:34:00]  But it's, you come out of the movie feeling so happy.  It's just if young people recognize that they've been a dormant generation.  And if they can just get it together to, you know, this is a movie for the 99%.  Yeah.  They should stand up and do something.  Did you think Occupy was a good thing?  Like at least got people moving?  Oh my God, of course it was a good thing.  It was a wonderful thing.  It still is a wonderful thing, you know. 
[02:34:30]  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, when you have people.  I like it.  Ant said really.  Oh, I'm over here going, really?  Yeah, Ant said really.  No, no, no.  No, when you have people standing up saying, we don't care that you're rich.  We just care that you're trying to buy our government.  Those are people that you can believe in.  Yeah, but then they do care that you're rich.  No, they don't.  No, they kind of do.  Well, they care if you're rich, if you're serious.  If you have somebody like, what's his name, Stanley, Stephen Schwartzman, you know, who says that Obama, when he tries to close that corporate tax loophole, when he says that, when he makes it akin, when he draws a parallel between that and the Nazis invading Poland. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, sure, take his $4.7 billion because he doesn't owe it.  You know, but when you have General Electric who makes $4 billion in profit and doesn't pay any tax and gets a rebate, yeah, sure, come on.  You know, Oliver Wendell Holmes said taxes are what you pay for a civilized society. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, but when do you think it kind of stops a little bit and gets a little more, you know, they can't keep taking, keep taking.  My God, it gets a little more.  But it's the people that aren't paying, see?  That's what I mean.  That's what I mean.  They keep taking, and that's what I mean.  The young people have to realize that it's their identity to take hold of and their destiny to realize and stop the taking, you know?  I mean, the taxes they keep taking from me.  See, I was on the other end of it.  I'm talking about, no, no. 
[02:36:00]  I don't like being taxed a lot.  Well, then you don't like a civilized society.  He doesn't.  He's very uncivilized.  You should see him eat with his hands.  It's disgusting.  I can't believe they got me on this show.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  He's part of the 1%.  You actually have listeners.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, can you believe it?  Boy, do we.  I know.  It really, it is astounding.  I was listening to NPR.  I was, I'm sorry.  Wow.  I was listening to NPR.  I came out of my house.  Would you have insomnia? 
[02:36:30]  I have insomnia.  I was driving on the PCH heading towards the McClure Tunnel, and she, the young woman, was interviewing Willie Nelson on the occasion of his 75th anniversary, and it was, I just heard the tail end of it.  It was a wonderful interview, and she was fine.  She was very young.  And as I got into the tunnel, she said, is there anything, it was the end of the interview, is there anything about being 75 that has surprised you?  And he said, yes. 
[02:37:00]  And you could hear in her voice how excited she was, because she thought, I've got a scoop.  This is it.  She said, and what was that?  And he said, I never thought that I would outlive my penis.  No.  You could tell.  You mean a loose.  Heavy, heavy traffic on the 10 going east, right?  Yeah.  In Los Angeles.  One out of every six cars went out of control.  That's a great line, man.  That's Willie, yeah. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, we've had Willie, yeah.  He is.  He likes his pot.  We'll say whatever the hell he wants.  He loves his pot.  I'm 43, and I'm already in a Cialis binge.  I don't know how anybody makes the 75 and keeps a solid rod.  We're going to talk about that stuff.  I require medication.  Jesus, this is the most depressing show.  No, that should be, that's uplifting.  That was uplifting.  Yeah, that was uplifting.  If it were uplifting, terrific.  Then he wouldn't need the Cialis.  Yeah, literally.  Yeah.  Hunger Games.  Have you ever refused the role because you didn't like the tone of it, or that you thought 
[02:38:00]  the movie itself was giving the wrong message?  He doesn't like your questions.  He doesn't like your questions.  Do you like his questions?  John Borman came and lived beside me for two weeks.  I love John Borman.  His twins came and played with my twins.  He wanted me to do a movie called Deliverance.  And I said, no, I do not.  I said, can you believe it?  No, I do not want to do violent films.  So he went and he cast John Voight and made Deliverance.  Sam Peckinpah said, please do Straw Dogs. 
[02:38:30]  I said, no, I do not want to do films that are violent.  And then I went to play a fascist in Novichonti, who killed a kid by swinging him around his head.  Oh, Jesus.  And the part they offered you in Straw Dogs, I guess, was Hoffman's part, or was it one of the...  Yeah.  No, it was her part, but I said...  Yeah.  No, it was the part that Dustin eventually played.  But yeah, I had to...  Alan Alder, have you ever talked about... 
[02:39:00]  I love...  Yes, he's one of my favorite people.  One of the great, great gentlemen.  And I was...  I didn't...  I'd never met him.  I was standing beside him in a lineup to meet the Queen Mother at a film, but a royal film performance in London.  And I saw that it was him, but we hadn't actually met.  And he...  His elbow hit my side, and I leaned in, because you couldn't look sideways, because you had to face the Prince Philip, actually, and the Queen Mum. 
[02:39:30]  And he leaned over towards me, and he said, I want to thank you for my life.  And it was the most elegant, wonderful thing.  Just...  Wow.  Wow, that's amazing.  Yeah, beautiful, eh?  Really beautiful.  That's all right, man.  Do you like the show?  Is it weird to watch someone else play a role that you've played?  I have to be truthful, I've never seen it.  But then I haven't seen MASH, either.  I mean, I saw half of it, but I haven't seen the whole thing. 
[02:40:00]  You ever watched the show?  I didn't watch the show, and I've only seen half the movie.  Half the movie?  Why do you guys do that?  Do you know how wrong it is that you just said to me and Donald Sutherland, why do you guys do that?  Like, we're both doing the same thing.  No, but...  No, I mean, we've heard it from other actors.  Why won't you watch some of your own work?  I don't get that.  Because it's not my own work.  I mean, I give somebody else my work, and they take it, and...  But I mean your own performance, I guess.  But they take my performance and change it around.  It's not me.  I don't give a shit.  But my character, you know, early on, I'd never seen Clute, for example, really protests 
[02:40:30]  because they've taken my arm and put it on my ear and that kind of stuff, you know?  And that bothers you, obviously.  Oh, God.  It bothers my character.  Was that bad?  No, no, it bothers my character.  It's that bad.  The look he gives you.  The look he gives you.  You'll be very happy that Dick Cheney has a new heart.  You'll be very happy to know that he has a heart.  I wouldn't wish ill of anybody. 
[02:41:00]  So, yeah, if, you know, he gets a new heart, that's...  He might have been a Cheney guy.  How does the donor's family feel?  Well, I guess that depends on their political affiliation, but I'm sure they would rather  have whoever the donor was in their life than Dick Cheney having a new heart.  He probably jumped the line in front of a few people, too.  No, he didn't.  It took 20 months.  Yeah, he was on the waiting list for a while.  To get a heart plant transplant when you're 71. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, that's going to take over.  That'll take a while.  That means he knows some people.  You think?  Oh, come on.  I don't know.  Remember Mickey Mantle getting his liver?  That was a travesty.  That was a travesty.  Yeah.  He drank through that second liver in two weeks.  Oh, did he?  I saw a guy with a heart transplant in Canada sitting in the window of his fish market smoking  cigarettes.  He was great.  Wow, really?  You know, and this was in Canada, and so we pay for it. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And I said, listen, mother.  But, you know, I don't give a shit what you do with yourself, but that's my heart.  You know, I paid for that.  So repoed it right there on it.  Do you, and not watching yourself, have you seen, like, Ordinary People or your performance  at JFK?  Ordinary People, my God.  Bob insisted I go see it.  Halfway through it, I got down in between the seats and crawled out of the seat.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Why?  You're so good in that.  You're great in that.  You're so good in that. 
[02:42:30]  I should see The Hunger Games because I'm really good in that.  We're going to see The Hunger Games.  Well, it's a testament to how great...  I love my character in The Hunger Games.  Gary Ross did just such a wonderful job of creating this because he wrote scenes in the  Rose Garden that Suzanne Collins is totally enthusiastic about, but that weren't in the  book.  Oh, they added some things in that weren't in the book.  To define for people the nature of this oligarchy of privilege that this allegory is about. 
[02:43:00]  Hey, have you seen the movie?  Have I seen the movie?  I've seen the movie twice.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Now you'll...  No.  In Kiefer, when I was not going to see Six...  God, the tea is really...  I'm allergic to it.  It just burped.  But when Six Degrees of Separation opened, Kiefer went in to see it, and I stayed outside  with Fred Skepsi, the director, and went to have some...  And he came out and he said, Dad, you really have to go see this one. 
[02:43:30]  So I went to see it, and I was okay, you know?  I mean, it was like having vertigo or something, you know?  You get over it.  Really?  And I get over it.  So I go see everything now.  Oh, okay.  I forgot you were in that with Stockard Channing, I think.  Didn't you play your way?  That was great.  Do you get embarrassed watching yourself?  Like, if I act, I get embarrassed watching myself.  And I probably should.  So does the audience.  I should get embarrassed.  It's incredible that he leaves himself open like that.  I know.  Believe me.  Wow.  And it's very rare of these guys to hit me below the belt. 
[02:44:00]  You should never be embarrassed about your work.  Donald, who do you play in Hunger Games?  We should get the basics out there for the people that haven't seen the film.  I play Coriolana Snow, who is the president of Panem.  That seems like him.  He's 76 years old.  He's beautiful.  No, he's great.  He really is great.  He's staring it open.  I'm hanging in there, though, man. 
[02:44:30]  I'm staring right back at him.  I'm trying.  Were you nervous when you had to...  No, don't do it.  When I came in here, I thought, gosh, look at these three wits.  I was going to say going through the audition process, but I couldn't say it.  Don't look at him.  When was the last time you auditioned for something?  Like, how many years has it been since you've had to do that?  Two.  Oh, no.  Hey, you know something?  After Ordinary People, I couldn't get an audition. 
[02:45:00]  I couldn't get a meeting for one year.  Why?  I couldn't get a job.  I couldn't get a job.  Why?  There are other people you have to ask, because I thought, I'm ready.  No, I couldn't get a job.  Weird, eh?  I was joking.  I figured you hadn't gotten an audition since MASH, but you'll still have to occasionally  ask you to read for something?  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  You know, and they'll say things like, oh, he's wrong for this.  He doesn't do comedy.  I say, I can tell you a joke. 
[02:45:30]  But you did MASH.  Precisely.  Yeah.  I did Kelly's Heroes.  Did you ever see Kelly's Heroes?  I've not seen Kelly's Heroes.  Come on.  It's great.  You did Clint Eastwood?  No.  It was wonderful.  It's a great cast.  Yeah.  And I resent the fact that those two, when I said I hadn't seen it, both went over the  top with how much he loved it.  To further humiliate the masculine.  Oh, wow.  We're trying to pile on now, Jimmy.  When I was a kid, I went to the movie theater in Central Islip, and all day on a Saturday  sat there with my friend, and we just watched it over and over again.  It's a long movie.  What are you saying?  Tickets for and selling?  Do you know how bad it makes you feel when they say, when I was a kid? 
[02:46:00]  That's why he said it.  He's just trying to hurt you.  Stick it to you.  Believe me.  That was him trying to hurt you.  It's all about taxation.  It's back to that.  Yes.  Don't tax me this much.  I'm barely holding on.  So what was the first job you got after Ordinary People?  Max Dugan Returns.  Oh, man.  And they offered it to you, or they wanted you to read for it?  No, it was a supporting role, and no, they didn't ask me to read for it.  Though, Herb Ross, he's dead now, was the director, and it's a film where my son plays 
[02:46:30]  baseball, and he doesn't have anything to do.  He'd just have one line.  There's just one little scene.  And Kiefer was there.  He would have been 16, I guess.  I said to Herb, can my son just do this?  He's not acted.  He's played an extra.  He was interested in it.  And Herb Ross said, I have to audition him.  And he took him into his trailer for two hours and came back out and said, no. 
[02:47:00]  No, he can't do it.  And he got some guy, I don't know, anyway, with all respect.  Wow, why do you say no?  Kie couldn't have been that bad.  No, he wasn't bad at all.  He was terrific, you know.  God, you'd think he would do your favor.  You're Donald Sutherland, for God's sake.  Yeah, really.  But when you look back and the guy's like, that's what I thought.  Who says he's not funny?  He's quick.  It's Donald Sutherland's quick.  What a shitty decision that is.  Kiefer's in one of the biggest shows in the last 50 years. 
[02:47:30]  And he's a wonderful actor.  He's a great actor.  And a fantastic man.  Yeah.  We did Letterman together.  And we're doing a movie.  We're going to do a movie.  Redemption.  Oh, you are?  We did.  Yeah.  You knew it?  No.  I did not know that.  I think you said, did I really do Letterman with him?  I said yes.  Leno.  Letterman?  Letterman.  Yeah.  Yeah, you were on Leno with Kiefer.  Yes.  Have you guys ever worked together?  What?  What?  No, I said, he's trying to brag is what he's trying to do.  Yeah, he is trying to brag to you.  He's trying to brag.  Well, I remember when Kiefer came off, he did his segment first and he had said that Donald, I think 
[02:48:00]  he said, had never won an Oscar.  And I was shocked by that.  I was shocked.  I couldn't win an Oscar.  Why?  No, I've never been nominated.  Oh, that helps.  No.  Maybe that was what he said.  That was a shock.  Wait, anyway, anyway, do you remember Johnny Carson?  Sure.  Milton, do you know who Ramsey Clark is?  Yes.  Was?  He was the attorney general for Lyndon Johnson.  And he was on Johnny Carson. 
[02:48:30]  Milton Berle had been there originally.  You know, Milton Berle did the opening and he was sitting down beside Ed McMahon.  And Ramsey Clark and Johnny Carson, where this would have been in the early, very early  70s, were talking about how to get out of Vietnam, how to end the Vietnam War.  And they were just having a conversation, you know, and not coming up, I must say, with  any solution.  And Milton Berle was waving his hand like that, like to the radio listeners, I'm waving  my hand.  And Johnny finally said, yes, Milton. 
[02:49:00]  And Milton said, I can tell you how to end the war.  And Ramsey Clark turned around and looked at him and Johnny said, how can we end the  war, Milton?  He said, well, you put it on ABC, they'll cancel it in three months.  Oh, damn.  That's good.  Hunger Games.  Yes, I'm going.  Hunger Games.  It's wonderful.  And it was really sold out.  Yeah.  Oh, no, I believe you.  $155 million.  You have an honest looking face. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, boy.  But if he said that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm a little more up.  Well, you know, political affiliation has nothing to do with who I find entertaining or  who I would be friends with.  I hope not, because you'd be alone in a room.  Hey, they didn't kill you off in this movie, right?  No, no, no.  I'm in the four.  In the four.  Oh, man.  Have they made more than one yet?  No.  Sometimes they do.  You know that.  They're making the second one this summer. 
[02:50:00]  Right.  And then the third and the fourth.  And they have to, you know, do them quickly because I'm 76.  Well, if you took that Animal House deal, that's like 200 grand.  Oh.  You brought up the Animal House.  What?  I thought, see, four movies.  Why would you bring up the Animal House?  And then it would be like 50 grand a pop.  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry.  I'd have to move that up.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I just felt like we were all kind of getting together and getting along here.  No, no, no.  We're not.  You misread that completely.  Because I feel totally alienated. 
[02:50:30]  I'm sorry, sir.  You misread that.  I'm out of tea.  I'm miserable.  I was trying to.  So there's going to be at least four movies.  That's cool.  I want to ask you.  Can I ask an actor question?  Yeah, maybe you'll get to see the fourth.  What?  Can I ask an actor question?  Can I ask an acting question?  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's looking at me.  Yeah, no, no, no.  I'm trying to prepare an answer for you.  How do you, when you read something...  Timing.  How do you make it yours? 
[02:51:00]  How do you make it yours?  Like you said, you didn't memorize the JFK per se.  You kind of just soaked it all in.  How do you look at dialogue?  But I knew it word for word.  What I'm saying is there's a difference between memorizing and knowing.  The end result is the same, except the end result for memorized is that it comes out by rote.  It sounds like certain political speakers, you know?  Right.  But if you know it, then it just sounds as if you're talking, like I'm talking to you, as opposed to reading off the teleprompter. 
[02:51:30]  And that comes from just absolutely going over it and going over it and...  Yeah, getting it so that it's an integral part of you.  Yeah.  Are you an actor?  I'm a comedian.  I do a little bit of acting, but my acting is, let's be honest, it's okay.  Well, okay is good.  I thought you were going to say it was terrible.  I should have. 
[02:52:00]  Roland is freaking out over here.  I guess Donald has to go.  Can I ask Donald something?  You're a busy man.  Did you have fun today?  Did I have fun here?  Yeah.  I need to go.  I'm so happy it's finished.  I actually had a wonderful time.  Yeah, two of you are really terrific.  But it's him is the one you don't like.  Of course it is.  He's the problem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I enjoyed the hell out of this. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, we loved you.  Donald.  And the Hunger Games is in theaters now, and obviously we're absolutely going to go soon.  You don't need a lot of help from us promoting it.  I know.  I don't even know why you're here.  You could have taken this hour off.  You don't need to promote this.  I flew in from Los Angeles last night.  I fly back this afternoon.  Wow.  Wow.  And as to your question of you don't know why I'm here?  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  And he's rolling his own luggage.  It's very confusing.  I know.  Very confused by this Donald Sutherland.  That really was a great entrance.  He just walked by and gave us the finger and left his luggage there. 
[02:53:00]  We're an odd man.  I'll never wash that finger.  Okay.  Goodbye, everybody.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Donald Sutherland.  Thank you.  Hunger Games, obviously, in theaters now.  I guess this time I'm a little murdered.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's almost time to go home. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  It's almost time to go home.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's almost time to go home.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's almost time to go home.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Donald Sutherland in studio today.  Oh, my God.  That was great.  I got to tell you, one of my favorite interviews of all time.  Yeah, he was, uh...  Just in general.  It was just an amazing experience.  I fucking loved it.  And he's a legend, so having him in here is really cool.  And then he just...  He's such a sarcastic...  Oh, when you figured that out, at first I was gulping.  I was like, oh, no. 
[02:54:00]  Why did I say that?  And then you realize he's just a sarcastic son of a bitch with quick comedic timing.  Yep.  Oh, I loved that.  God.  That was cool.  I'm glad.  Because I've always...  I love those movies.  Yeah.  And, you know, have him come in here and not be a dick is pretty cool.  Because for me, it's very easy to bitch, obviously.  But the other side of it, I fucking loved today.  That was fucking...  Yeah, that was good.  I told my brother, because he goes, how cool is that?  I go, dude, it just fucking...  I go beyond.  Yeah.  Today's one of those days where I just fucking realized I love what I do. 
[02:54:30]  And I consider myself lucky.  Yeah, that was very cool.  That was so much fun.  And he really had a good time.  He just hung out for 10 minutes, by the way.  He had another interview, and he just hung out during the whole break.  He was spraying Jimmy with his cologne.  With his cologne, yeah.  And then, I don't know, they brought the cologne back in because Jimmy wants it now.  I think Jimmy wants to steal it.  I think he's trying to negotiate for the cologne right now.  Oh, he'll put that up somewhere in his house.  Donald Sutherland's perfume.  Well, then creepy Jimmy had to drink his tea that he left behind. 
[02:55:00]  Did he?  Yeah, he drank his tea.  The tea's right there.  That's the tea that Donald Sutherland was drinking.  Maybe he'll get the essence of Donald Sutherland and be able to act better.  You never know.  Part of Donald Sutherland goes into Jimmy.  That was pretty cool.  And I was saying, it just amazes me when these guys come in, these huge, over-the-top, famous  fucking people, and they don't see their own work.  They haven't seen, like, MASH yet.  You think he actually did, but it's cool to say he didn't?  No, he seems too... 
[02:55:30]  I believe him.  He's at the point he doesn't have to lie for anything to anybody.  He didn't see ordinary people?  No.  Because he said that Kiefer, after...  Oh, he said it on the air.  Six Degrees of Separation.  Yeah, yeah.  Kiefer said, you've got to see this one, Dad.  And then he went and saw it, and he's seen those since.  But no, I believe him.  He's probably one of those guys that just...  Spencer Tracy was like that.  Because it bothers him when he realizes what they do with his performance.  I've never heard that before from some of these guys.  They're bothered by it, because they see it another way in their head when they're acting 
[02:56:00]  it out, and then they see the final product and go, what the fuck?  You moved my shit around.  Yrock, please email me those pictures today.  There's a picture...  Today, how about you do it immediately?  Right now, it's like a Twitter one.  Please.  How about I'm doing it right now?  Oh, shit!  He just spit on the boss.  He just told you, pretty much, that was saying shut the fuck up.  No, Yrock just said shut the fuck up.  I'm losing the fucking Yrock thing today.  Oh, man.  He's kicking my ass.  Today, we've watched Yrock go from the young boy who looked at you and looked up at you,  and you were just amazing. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, I am.  And now...  What?  But now we're looking like...  What happened?  Now he's reached those teen years where he's rebelling against you.  But behind the scenes, I've told Yrock, all I ever wanted from this kid was for him  to fight back.  That's all I ever wanted.  Oh, well, now look at what you got.  And now I wish I'd never told him that.  You fucking created a monster.  He's kicking my ass.  Is he on Twitter, Sutherland?  I don't know.  He came...  He really...  He had a great time.  And we were off air when he was signing stuff.  And then he... 
[02:57:00]  I asked him, like, what was the cologne?  I forget.  It's some French name.  Yeah.  So he fucking goes into his luggage.  They're waiting for him to go to other press.  He goes into his luggage and gets it.  And he calls me back in and sits there and sprays me with his cologne.  And then he sprays some on his neck.  You're not going to shower for a couple days, right?  I wouldn't have anyway.  So now my balls will still stink.  But I'll still wash my balls.  Yeah, wash your balls.  Keep that neck not washed.  I'm going to smell Donald Sutherland for a few days.  Donald Sutherland sprayed me with cologne.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, I was too scared to say it. 
[02:57:30]  A lot of people did the math.  He lost out on $2.8 million.  2.8.  Yeah.  Jesus.  And he made $50,000.  Yeah, $50,000.  I think it was $50,000 for his day's work.  That's his day's work.  And he could have made $2.8 million.  Oh, you're going to pay me my day's pay?  What?  Wow.  What?  Truth is on your side, Bubba.  And that's a day's pay in 1978 was $50,000.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a lot of fucking money in men.  Sure.  I bet you the $2.8 million is higher.  It probably is. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, yeah.  And he'd probably still be getting like every so often, here's your animal house.  Oh, God, yeah.  It's much higher.  He lost a lot of money, but I mean, he's probably made so much since then.  Oh, you think?  Yeah.  Being Donald Sutherland.  Yeah.  True time.  And then with this movie.  Is there any Little Murders there?  You can't find that, right?  I bet you on YouTube there's none of it.  He was so fucking great.  He only had one scene.  He plays a preacher.  Why'd you bring that movie in for him to sign?  That's weird.  Out of everything he's done.  I see you did bring in your damn day.  I brought in the disc.  I didn't have the box.  Because Little Murders is one of my favorite Sutherland performers.  Otto turned me on to it years ago. 
[02:58:30]  So, and he's so, I don't even know if they'll show him in the trailer, but he does a wedding  and Vincent Gardena pays him to mention God because his daughter's marrying an atheist.  Right.  And he's just very entertaining.  People want us to explain the Sutherland Animal House thing.  I think we just did.  Basically, they offered him 2% of the movie or a day's pay, which was $50,000 for him back  then.  And some people who did the math said it was at least $2.8 million he passed up on. 
[02:59:00]  Well, he didn't know.  He didn't know that Animal House was going to be as great as it was.  What was the other thing he said that I couldn't believe?  Oh, he was never nominated for an Oscar?  Is that possible?  Yeah, never nominated.  Was he just busting balls?  No, no, no.  That was what Kiefer said.  Never.  But then as I was saying it, I hesitated because I'm like, did he win for fucking...  Even for, you know, supporting?  No, nothing.  Come on.  That's crazy.  That seems crazy.  I think he wrote W and then that's an O-R-K. 
[02:59:30]  I think it says work on it.  Oh, maybe.  Jimmy Work.  Jimmy Work on it.  Maybe you're acting.  Oh, work on it.  Yeah.  Okay, follow it.  Because he signed Little Murders for me and then he went back in and he wrote something  else.  He didn't like your political views, sir.  None of them do.  None of them do.  But he's, you know, Hollywood fucking elite.  He's fucking...  He's one of the royalty.  He really is.  I give him a pass on anything.  There's no one...  There's no actor in Hollywood he couldn't be comfortable with. 
[03:00:00]  Like, he worked...  They listed who he worked with fucking...  He's worked with Brando, obviously De Niro, Sarandon, Mary Tyler Moore, Will Smith, Oliver  Stone, Michael Douglas, Hoffman, Freeman, Clint East...  Like, there's nobody...  Oh, there he is.  Oh, he's so great.  The only one he'd be...  That's so cool.  Oh, my God.  The only one he'd be in line with, like, with Alan Alda standing in a line would be to meet  the Queen, you know?  They're all just, like, fucking amazing actors.  Thank you for my life.  Thank you for my life.  Don't we have stories like that?  Uh, yeah, yeah. 
[03:00:30]  Just like that, right?  We're in line at Starbucks.  Right.  And we run it to Danny Bonaduce.  That's our equivalent story.  That's it.  Had a burger joint once.  Wow.  We're just like Donald Starwood.  Well, it's a good cologne.  It's...  Vietnam.  When he was saying words like Vietnam, he was reminding me so much of his character in  JFK, because to hear him say that Vietnam in certain things, I could just hear that fucking  monologue.  Fuck, was he good, man. 
[03:01:00]  That was fun, man.  I really enjoyed the hell out of that.  Yeah.  Why don't we get the fuck out of here?  I'm so happy he had fun, too.  Jimmy Caroline's sold out, probably?  No, but it is selling very well.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 2-on-2, 7-5-7, 4-100.  Nice.  For tickets.  And, uh, I'm going to Washington, D.C. in a couple weeks.  First gigs ever...  Washington.  ...at the D.C. Improv, which will be the 12th through the 14th of, uh, April. 
[03:01:30]  April 12th through 14th, I'll, uh, be at D.C. at the, uh, Improv.  Improvization.  Why are we, um...  Still here?  Still, uh, on the air.  Can I still have Donald Sutherland fever?  Ah!  Oh, my fucking Sutherland picture.  I look like a fucking...  A what?  I don't know.  Hot stud with a V?  Fucking dope.  You've got a good body.  Fuck yeah, man. 
[03:02:00]  I'm taking a body.  Fucking...  That body looks pretty smoky.  Ah!  Look at a stupid fucking picture.  You agree, Sam?  Oh, yeah.  All right, let's calm down.  Look at that bod.  Do you have a lot of my interviews on the hard drive?  I gave Sam a hard drive to put my interviews on, and I know he's not putting them on there.  I am putting them on.  I know he's not, because he's fucking...  Of course he is.  No, he's not.  He's too busy fucking positioning his wrestling pictures.  Like, oh, Jim wants this Michael K. Williams interview, but first, I want to make fucking  macho man's feet do this.  Do you think I've taken it out of the box? 
[03:02:30]  No.  Oh, no.  I hope so.  It's time to...  Can we go?  Yeah.  I mean, technically, you still have four minutes.  Shut up, Sam.  I agree, Sammy.  Fuck.  Fuck.  The O.P. and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around, After One Day Live is next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony show continues. 
[03:03:00]  This is After One Day Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes.  After O.P. and Anthony Live, I just went out.  Donald Sutherland, who is in studio today, obviously.  I hope you all heard that interview from start to finish.  If you didn't, make sure you catch the replay.  But Mr. Sutherland was out there in the hallway just now.  He's doing a couple other shows here at Sirius.  He might be done now. 
[03:03:30]  I don't know for sure.  But he was doing a couple other shows.  So I went out real quick to grab a photo with him before this started.  Because I knew I wasn't going to have a chance after.  And, you know, I went up to him after he got out of the studio and said,  Hey, you know, Mr. Sutherland, would you mind taking another picture?  And, you know, would you mind terribly?  And he gave me this look like, did you just step in shit?  Who in the hell do you think you are?  Well, I don't know if you saw it, but he looked at the top of your hair first. 
[03:04:00]  And then looked quickly down at you and was just like, ugh.  Well, listen, Sutherland, you don't exactly have traditional grown man hair either.  He came in here with...  But he's earned it.  So how long do I have to take before I've earned it?  He's always had long hair since he was young.  Yes, but the full beard and the Santa Claus kind of long, wavy hair.  I guess he's also...  He has a certain degree of skill that I simply don't possess.  So in that respect, even when he was young, he was still good at what he does. 
[03:04:30]  Which I'm still working on as we speak.  When you get older, you can rock whatever look you want.  And no one's going to give you shit over it.  And then they'll look at the old pictures of me and be like, oh, that makes sense.  Because that's his look.  But now it just doesn't work.  But yeah, he was a hilarious guest.  Just because I love when somebody like that comes in here.  Like a Donald Sutherland who is Hollywood royalty.  So right away, it's like Opie, Anthony, Jim, like, you know, they're a little off their game. 
[03:05:00]  Because they've got to figure out how to read him before the interview really gets going.  Because, you know, this is a guy who they don't want to upset.  They want to make sure that they're going with his vibe, whatever that is.  And, you know, just reading the situation.  With some other people that come in here, it's a who gives a fuck parade.  You know, it doesn't matter what their vibe is.  It doesn't matter what they think because Opie and Anthony know they're bigger than those celebrities are anyway. 
[03:05:30]  I mean, they thought that with The Rock at one point and were wrong.  But more often than not, they're right.  They come in here and, you know, it's like if so-and-so is on his way in here, we really don't have to do anything special.  We'll just be ourselves.  And he will vibe with what our show is.  When someone like Donald Sutherland comes in here, you are now vibing with him.  And so when he came in here and the quest to figure out whether he was pissed or sarcastic for the first whatever ten minutes or so of the interview was just hilarious.  And I know that Opie, Anthony, and Jim, especially Opie, also just bathe in that awkwardness and just love it. 
[03:06:00]  But I think, I mean, I think based on the read that I got from him, he had a great time in here.  He did.  You could tell, right?  Like, because it was just not a traditional radio interview.  And they were acknowledging, like when he took a shot at them, they weren't going, oh, Donald, and moving on to the next thing.  Like, they were like, okay, let's swim in this for a little while.  And that's what you don't get on radio. 
[03:06:30]  That's what makes the Opie and Anthony show very, very special.  Sal, you're still an intern.  I hope you were taking notes on that and realizing some special things going on.  Absolutely.  Were you listening to the interview?  I was, yeah.  I was panicking a little bit.  Because you weren't, is that during the period of, is this sarcastic or is he pissed?  Yeah, no, yeah, exactly.  You couldn't tell at first?  I couldn't tell at all.  How long did it take you as not being in here and reading the facial expressions?  I don't know.  Like half the interview?  More than half.  I'd say more than half, yeah. 
[03:07:00]  Definitely.  Like you're 20 minutes in going, oh boy, this is, this is not going well, guys.  No.  Um, yeah, I mean, for a second, I thought, for just a split second, and by the way, this  is not a star on the caliber of Donald Sutherland, but what's his name?  Norm from Cheers.  Like, that was a not sarcastic, just awkward interview.  No, that was not an enjoyable, entertaining, awkward interview.  You didn't find that entertaining? 
[03:07:30]  After, after we figured out what the fuck was going on, that it was just all him.  Yeah.  Then I was like, okay, now it was entertaining.  But at that moment, you're like, what the fuck is going on?  See, there's two schools of thought here.  Like, somebody like me, like, I love moments where it's like, oh my, what is, what, what  the fuck is happening?  Like, why, why is this conversation happening like this?  Why is he being so difficult?  None of this makes any sense.  Um, do you have any of that Norm interview?  I know it's a last minute thing. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, I don't know if I have a, of a hit off of this.  Because it was, it was long and uncomfortable, but those are the best moments here.  Like, sometimes they work out extraordinarily well for everybody, like with Donald Sutherland,  uh, who's in the Hunger Games right now.  And sometimes it just works out well for us in the sense that we have something to talk  about, as was the case with, uh, Norm.  Because Norm came in here, if you remember, he was promoting this book, and it was just  about drinking beer.  Like, some people, they leave their sitcom roles where they become very famous, and they 
[03:08:30]  decide to leave that all behind, move on to the next thing, and, and, and try something  else.  Become, you know, have the careers based on themselves, not based on what that role on  the sitcom was.  Like, Ted Danson, okay, once he struck gold with three men and a baby, he didn't need  Cheers anymore.  And then he put blackface on, so he left it all behind, you know what I mean?  I think that, that doesn't sound right. 
[03:09:00]  What?  I think he went back to Cheers, didn't he?  He did two movies and went back to Cheers.  I mean, I thought it kind of peaked at three men and a baby, was that not?  I think it peaked at Becker.  Becker, yeah, that's true.  And then he went back to TV.  And Becker, hey, come on.  But listen, Norm did not, I think he probably tried to leave the Cheers thing behind.  It wasn't working out.  And so he wrote this book about-  A book, by the way, that would have probably been better had he released it while on Cheers.  Right. 
[03:09:30]  Exactly.  He might as well have written the book as Norm.  Like, he might as well have written the book in character, not as this actor.  What's his name?  George Wynn.  George Wynn.  The book was, I didn't remember his name, the book was by the actor, George Wynn, but  it might as well have been written by Norm because it was just a book about beer, about  different kinds of beer, about where you can get beer, about how you can prepare beer.  So-  This would have been, you're right, this would have been better had it been written as Norm. 
[03:10:00]  Right.  Like, look, Norm has written a book, and then George Wynn could come around promoting it  and saying, yeah, I wrote the book as the character, Norm.  Like, that's a humiliating interview to have to sit down and say that I had to channel  this character that somebody else wrote to write a book about beer.  But it's not as humiliating as, yeah, I'm the actor who played this character, and now  I'm writing about what this character is interested in.  But I guess George Wynn is also interested in beer. 
[03:10:30]  Because as the interview started, you know, we start asking him questions about beer, and  as I thought was a good question, asking him questions about whether or not he was an  alcoholic.  Because that's, like, if-  How dare you.  If your passion in life is alcohol, you might be an alcoholic.  Anthony Cumia has other passions in life.  That wasn't a shot at Anthony.  He's got tons of stuff going on.  Alcohol is one of his passions, but that doesn't mean anything. 
[03:11:00]  He's not writing books about wine, yet.  So there's no reason to throw that.  But when George Wynn came in here, yeah, we were like, you know, especially Jim, he was  like, hey, you know, have you ever thought, are you an alcoholic?  And I think that was the point where everything turned ugly.  And that was actually ugly.  Not like the great Donald Sutherland here, who just held us, not only the audience, but  all of us in studio in the palm of his hand, thinking, is he being sarcastic, or is this  getting weird?  For George Wynn, for Norm from Cheers, it never, he, there was nobody was in any, everybody 
[03:11:30]  was just spilling all over the place.  Nobody was in anyone's palm.  And, and, and, and he was, there was never a question of, is he being sarcastic, or did  this just get ugly?  It was just, it was just an ugly day.  Did we have a shorter clip of that?  I'm looking, it kind of went on.  Yeah.  For when he started asking him about his alcoholism.  That's where it started, right?  I was right.  Yeah, but then it goes on for a while, where they try to weave in other subjects, and then 
[03:12:00]  it comes back into, like, there's a long pause, and up goes, what's wrong, George?  I kind of want to hear a little bit of that.  Can we, can we, can we, hold on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's just start it from a point and play it.  By the way, a lot of people are tweeting me about the Cleveland, oh, and maybe I will,  I mean, people speaking of Twitter were tweeting me about SNL ripping me off again on Saturday.  That was a rerun, but yes, they did rerun the episode where they ripped me off, so maybe 
[03:12:30]  I'll talk about that.  But also, as far as Cleveland goes, we don't have, you know, the on sale, I don't think  we're going to sell tickets, but we don't have all the venue information and the who,  what, why, where, and when yet, but we are doing Cleveland.  It'll be on the Friday before Jim's show at the end of the month in April, so I think  it's the last Friday in April.  We will be in Cleveland, so just leave that day clear on your calendar for now, and hopefully  you'll get to see the show, because we've got a lot of great stuff planned. 
[03:13:00]  Now, is that true?  I don't know.  I actually don't know if we have anything planned, but we should have something.  Also, with the Donald Sutherland thing, Jim, you can tell when Jim is obsessed, because  he starts, he wants the experience with these celebrities, and he acknowledges all the different  senses that they're hitting him on.  You can tell when Jim is excited about somebody, because he'll say something about their cologne. 
[03:13:30]  He said stuff about Gene Simmons' cologne.  He said stuff about Ozzy's cologne.  He loves the way some of these men smell, and I don't think we got it on tape.  Michael K. Williams, too.  Michael K. Williams, exactly.  All these guys that Jim loves.  E-Rock snapped a couple pictures of it, which I'm sure he'll put up on Facebook, slash Opie  and Anthony, but Donald Sutherland, while we were on commercial break, was actually, like,  after Jim said, no, really, you smell amazing, he went into his luggage, he took out his cologne, 
[03:14:00]  and he gave Jim two spritz on either side of the neck.  It was one of the most intimate things I've ever seen between a show host and a celebrity  on that caliber.  It was really a wonderful thing, which only made Jim more excited, because after he gets  spritzed on either side of the neck, he leaves the studio for a little while, and then he  comes back.  As he said, with Donald Sutherland fever, he looks at the half-drank glass of tea, or plastic  cup, as Mr. Sutherland so regally pointed out, and he notices it's still on the table, and 
[03:14:30]  he picks it up, and he announces to the room that he's going to have a sip of this, and  he just, he takes a sip of Donald Sutherland's tea, as if that's going to give him that power.  I don't know if it actually will, but it was something to behold.  Jim, he gets giddy over some of these people.  I mean, he obviously, you know, he's got a lot of admiration for a guy like Donald Sutherland.  I don't know who doesn't, but he gets giddy for these people, and so, yeah, he's going 
[03:15:00]  to want to experience the taste of Donald in the tea.  He's going to want to experience the smell of Donald in the cologne.  That's just a little weird.  No, this is, he likes all, he got,  No, I know he likes doing that, but I've never seen him drink somebody else's beverage after  they left.  Yeah, it may be the first time that we've meant, that we've noticed him experiencing the taste  of a guest, very much about the touch in handshakes or arm around the shoulder, very much about 
[03:15:30]  the sight in terms of photos, as we discussed the smell, of course, the cologne, the hearing  in terms of through the headphones and all that, but yes, he got to experience the taste  of Donald Sutherland today, which is something that, I don't know how many of you, everybody's  got their celebrities that they love out there, how many of you have gotten to experience the  taste of that celebrity? Literally. Not like, you know, have a moment of their life, like 
[03:16:00]  literally, taste is the sense that, not a lot of you. Have you ever gotten to experience  the taste of Hulk Hogan, Eric?  No.  Neither have I.  Have you got to experience the taste of McFoley?  Mmm. No, I mean, he fed me, but I don't think that counts as experience. I mean, he did  hit me on that taste level.  Yeah.  So do you think that works?  No, he's got to either taste the food through the spoon that he fed you with, or vice versa.  I have to eat something after him, not from him. 
[03:16:30]  Like if he had a sandwich with him and you took a bite.  Right. It would have to be like a peanut butter and jelly or like a chicken cutlet or  something, because my tastes are very particular.  No, it would be whatever he was eating.  Well, if you catch him eating a chicken cutlet sandwich one day, let me know and I will have  a bite.  Yeah. And say, Mick, save a bite for old Sammy boy.  I'll wave you around. Sam, it's going down now. Come on.  Mick, you put any hot sauce on that? I like hot sauce.  I don't know.  Did you, uh, did you grab that clip? 
[03:17:00]  Um, yeah, I have, uh, it's not the what started it, but it's a part where, uh, Jim just goes,  I need to go back to the drinking again.  Yeah. Does this highlight the awkwardness of it?  It doesn't have to be where it starts. I just want, I just want to feel the awkwardness  of the George Wendt interview from what, when, when was this? Two years ago?  Hold on.  A year and a half?  This was from two, October of 2010.  Okay.  So is that right? No, sorry. May of 2010.  May of 2010. So it was almost two years ago. Um, and George Wendt came in to talk about his 
[03:17:30]  book about drinking. Uh, yeah. And that's what I want to have. I want the audience right  now to feel that uncomfortableness. Is it in there? Will this do it for them, Eric?  Um, I believe so. Cause they keep going. He talks about how drinking was affecting his  kids and were you uncomfortable listening to it? Um, at this point I was just, I think  I was just trying to understand what the hell was going on. Okay. That's good too. And then  a little later on now I'm like, I can't even focus on this. This is just too sad. There's 
[03:18:00]  nothing. Okay. Here's a, here's a little bit from George Wendt on the Opie and Anthony  show.  So the drinking, I want to get back to the drinking. I like the fact that George was honest.  He said he drinks every night. Um, see Jimmy, uh, stopped drinking and doing drugs at 17,  18, 18. I'm sorry. 18 years old. He knew he just couldn't, uh, do the drinking thing  there, George.  I was, I was not a functional guy when I drank. Are you, as a guy who drinks every night,  is it, have you had gigs that kind of got messed up because of it? Like you're supposed 
[03:18:30]  to have a call at six and you get there at eight or no, no, I don't. Uh, when I say every  night, it's not, um, that's if I'm left to my own devices, you know, right. If I, if  I have, uh, something like, for example, when my kids were in grade school, you know, like  I would only drink on weekends cause you know, I had to like hit the deck at six 30 or something  and, you know, feed them, get them out the door, blah, blah, blah. Cause they don't understand  hangovers. Right. George that too. And then the night before I was always like, you know, 
[03:19:00]  now did you do homework? And you know, so, um, you know, I, I was a lot more responsible,  but now I'm just sort of sliding, sliding back into my like college days where you can  kind of do what you want. Kind of. Yeah. Unless I have a gig. Does it feel good or does it kind  of feel like, uh, floating somewhere? It feels fine. I, I, frankly, I wish I was busier and  then maybe I'd, you know, probably, you know, take care of myself a little better. I was 
[03:19:30]  busier. You mean, uh, you mean eating better or do you mean, uh, drinking less? Just drinking  less. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, um, I eat well. Are you, are you a vomiter? You mean vomiter  like drinking? No. So you never throw it up? No. Yeah. I have. Yeah. Actually I did it. Um,  when a couple of summers ago, my brother poisoned me and you threw up. Yes. It was,  it was so frat boy. It was like, yeah. Are you a blackout drinker? No. No. You remember 
[03:20:00]  everything? Yeah. You have to make the some, I used to make the phone calls. There's gotta  be some calls you make where you're like, uh, what exactly? When they call you back and  you try to piece together the night before, but you're back like, yeah, no, no, I remember  that. No, no, no. So you drink every night a lot. Um, but it hasn't really affected you  that badly. Well, I don't know. You know, uh, I'm obviously grossly overweight, you know,  maybe that's, you know, could have something to do with it. It could be an effect, but, 
[03:20:30]  uh, um, no, other than that, I wouldn't say. Does the weight, is it, uh, something like  for me, it's sex, you know, I mean, eating is tough. I think eating and sex are very similar  because you can't be abstinent. Like, you know what I mean? You can, you can not drink,  you can not do drugs, but you can't not fuck or you can't not be sexual. You can't not  weight. So is it, is it been something that's always been a struggle for you? Where you're  like, all right, I kind of want to fix this or, I mean, how do you kind of take that on?  What? The weight? Yeah. The weight, you know, just try to, you know, exercise a lot. And, uh, 
[03:21:00]  if, if I, you know, obviously I know how to lose weight, the hard part's keeping it off.  So, I mean, it's, it's kind of fun to lose weight, you know, cause it's all very active and,  you know, um, when you're going to do that. Yeah, you can do, you know, you can do it pretty  easy. Oh, it's just, uh, you know, cause it's just like maybe several weeks and it's  like, you know, people are like, Oh my God, you look fabulous. Yeah. Right. And then it's  just gets really boring. And it kind of motivates you to lose more for, right. Then you go right 
[03:21:30]  back to, it sounds like you need beer, George. I think that's what Jimmy's getting at. You  need beer. No, George kind of, you seem talking to, you seem like a little, I know you're tired  too, cause morning radio is a bitch, but you seem a little bummed a little bit. Yeah.  Slightly bummed. Oh, geez. I don't know. But, you know, maybe if we change the subject,  maybe I wouldn't be, but, uh, you know, you can talk, you talk about it. It's hard to change  the subject when the book is called drinking. Yeah. That's what kind of motivated me to talk 
[03:22:00]  about it. Yeah. Okay. Cause it leads, uh, into the book, a barstool professional's guide  to beer drinking with George. Yeah. That's good. It's fun. Yeah. That's it. It's a, it's a laugh  a minute. I forgot how uncomfortable it was. I can't believe how bad that was. I told you  it's long. Oh my. And, and how long was the interview total? Uh, total 42 minutes. We 
[03:22:30]  talked to that poor, poor man for 42 minutes. Well, the, you know what? The, the interview  might be, I'd say maybe shave off five, 10 because we had Kenny come in afterwards. And, uh, remember  George was out in the hall reluctantly taking photos with people. Oh yeah. I'll talk about  that in a minute, but trying to get him back in. Yeah. It was just because what you notice  from that is this guy, George went from cheers. He comes in and he's trying to promote a book  that he thinks is about fun drinking stories. Like I'm sure what he figures is, Oh yeah. 
[03:23:00]  When, you know, we have fun, we drink beer, blah, blah, blah. We'll go to the bar guys  watching sports, blah, blah, blah. Or, you know, like frat guys telling stories or whatever,  just like drinking, being fun. He had no idea that he was walking into the studio for an  intervention. This was not a book about him coping with drinking. You know what I mean?  This was not like him. And it was not a tell all book. It was a fun facts about beer. That's 
[03:23:30]  all it was. It was in the humor section of the book of the bookstore. It was in the humor.  Section next to the Letterman top 10 list. And so he, yes. And so he comes in and thinking,  Oh, we're just going to, you know, me and the guy, this is a guy's show, obviously. So we're  just going to tell some fun drinking stories, not realizing that we're going to be like, cause  I mean, I think that it's appropriate line of questioning because in my mind, I'm saying 
[03:24:00]  this guy sounds like an alcoholic, but I don't think he gets, you know, the, that gets said  to him enough that there's honest people in broadcasting that will say, you know, well,  then we'll start asking him things like, you know, are you a blackout drunk? Do you vomit?  Have you ever fucked up a, a gig because of drinking and things like this that are just  like, well, what do you, what, what's going on guys? You're not asking me fun drunk stories.  You're these are questions that an alcoholic gets asked. If I answer yet. And then he knew 
[03:24:30]  that too, that if he answers yes to too many of the questions, that's why he was like, no,  no, no, no, no, not really. Cause he knows that that's the test that if you answer yes  to a certain amount of those questions, yeah, that means you're an alcoholic. That's how they  figure it out. And yeah. And guess what? Nobody wants to hear an alcoholic who's an admit, an  admitted alcoholic coming out with a book talking about his fun drinking stories. Cause now it's a 
[03:25:00]  problem. Now it's not the fun guy from cheers anymore. It's the overweight man who's got a  serious drinking problem. Yeah. Then that's the book that you release after you've done rehab and  cleaned up your life. And it was just so sad. It's like a Motley Crue book or something. That  was like a tell all blah, blah, blah. This was not a tell all. This was not him. It was so sad when he  said, well, I guess I wouldn't drink as much if I'd like to be a little more busy. Uh, cause he's just  like, Oh, he's not getting any work either. And he just said that. And then Opie, Mr. Charming over here, 
[03:25:30]  did, I don't know if you guys caught that. I definitely caught it when, uh, George goes,  you know, I exercise and Opie said, what are you going to start doing that?  It's just mean.  Do you think George heard that?  Well, he pretended not to cause in his head he goes, there's no way that this guy who's hosting  the show that is interviewing me, there's no way that he could have just insensitively said, 
[03:26:00]  when are you going to start that? He must have said, it must be hard to start that. Cause  the question he answered was it must be hard to start that. No. Yeah. As opposed to when  are you going to start that? You know, this show has gotten so good over the years where  to situations that it's evolved from and to where it is now back in the old days at any  W if they had somebody on the phone like this or somebody in the studio like this, there'd  be a button on the board that you could, uh, they could mute out from that person. They 
[03:26:30]  couldn't hear what you're saying on the mic. So they could say all these horrible things  about the person whispering them. You could say stuff like that. And then you'd be holding  a button and the guy couldn't hear it. When we got to satellite, they were like, yeah,  you know what? We don't need that anymore. We're just going to tell these people on the  phone and into their face in the studio. Good. All the problems. And, and, and the other  thing that I was picking up on while that interview was on was to, I thought the George  went, was trying to, when he said like, I'm grossly overweight. So there's that I believe. 
[03:27:00]  And I believe this with every fiber of my being that he was trying to be funny. That was self  deprecating humor. And when the guys responded with silence and it was almost like an Oprah  interview, like, uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. I see where that would be a problem. Like, you know what?  Attack yourself so they'll stop attacking you. Right. And it didn't work. Like that  was, that was sort of just like, cause it wasn't an attack. He was just trying to get 
[03:27:30]  some humor across and the guys decided, no, we're going to confront you. George went,  you have a problem. And the Opie and Anthony show is where you come to get better. We, the  Opie and Anthony show are Sirius XM's help net. We are the, the compassionate show that  you can come to, to bring this out, which is not what we are at all, but it's hilarious.  Um, we should talk to Casey in LA. Casey, you're on after ONA live. 
[03:28:00]  Hey, what's going on guys? Good morning.  What's up Casey?  Hey, I just want to point out that at some point in the interview, you can literally just  hear Opie going, uh, it's like groaning in the background just because, cause it is a  difficult position to be sitting where Opie is sitting and realizing that for whatever  reason, because of the line of questioning, because of whatever it is that your guest has  decided to completely clam up. And I mean, thanks man. Yeah. It was, it was hilarious. 
[03:28:30]  Cause the reason in this scenario was that George went, was just not ready to be questioned  on this. Like he was just woke up and he walked from his hotel to here. Yeah. And he just wasn't  in that frame of mind in his life. He was not at that point where he's ready to tackle the  problem. He's obviously, to me, he, he struck me as somebody who probably is suffering from  alcoholism, but he doesn't want to admit that. You know what I mean? And he knows that admit it, 
[03:29:00]  but he doesn't want to do anything about it. Not only does he not want to do anything about  it, he wants to write books about how great it is to be an alcoholic. He knows that somewhere  in the back of his mind, he knows that he is suffering from alcoholism in my mind. This  is all what I took from listening to the interview, just like all of you. But in my mind, I see  a guy who knows that he's an alcoholic, but he doesn't want to admit that. And so when  that line of questioning is brought up, he clams up. It's just, it's uncomfortable. 
[03:29:30]  You know what I mean? Poor George. Poor George is still alive, but that wasn't it. I don't  know. I'll look it up. Oh, and that's what we're going to talk about. And then after the  interview, I think it was me and Travis who decided we should get some George Wendt photos.  Now I didn't even watch Cheers. Okay. I don't care about Cheers. I became a fan of George  Wendt because he's the guy from that awkward interview that ONA did. So, so that's why I wanted  to get a picture with him because I wanted to see what it would be like for somebody coming 
[03:30:00]  out of that experience to have one of the staffers ask for their photo. And he, it's probably  the least happy celebrity photo I have. Like, is he faking the smile, but no, I show he's  sad. He's not even faking a smile. He's straight faced. He's got one foot towards the door.  He is ready to go. And I think Travis was the same way that it just ready to go. And  that's the whole difference. Like, that's why I wanted to hear that. Cause that's a truly 
[03:30:30]  awkward interview. Like Donald Sutherland today, like you thought it could get awkward, but  he's just, he happens to be a guy who's hilarious. And that's why when we went outside and I asked  for a picture with Donald Sutherland, he looked at me like I had stepped in shit, but he was  goofing. He was being, you know, cause he's just a, he's a quick witted person. Whereas  Norm from Cheers, not terribly quick witted, just a guy who's, who's had a lot of shit handed 
[03:31:00]  to him, I guess you remember Travis. It's one of my favorite photos I have. And I did it  for the exact same reason that you did. Forget about Cheers. It's, this is the guy who had  the most awkward interview on the show ever. First of all, I knew that there was no possible  way I'd ever get another picture. Cause he's not coming back on this show. Never coming  back. I love probably got cirrhosis of the liver or something. He's not going to be around  that much longer. He just looks so depressed. Yeah. He, he came in. Did you hear, were you  listening to that clip I played? Did you hear when he said, well, you know, I'm horribly 
[03:31:30]  overweight for one. Tell me I was wrong. Tell me he was trying to get away with some self  deprecating humor. I don't know what he was trying to do. And when Opie and Anthony and  Jim met that with silence, it became just a thing that sat there. It just became a fact.  You know, it just became somebody struggling with what he came in in a, in a, in a, he  looked like he rolled out of bed. Yeah. And that he was getting all fucked up the night  before. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Travis is finding the George Wentz photo. He is alive. Oh, thank 
[03:32:00]  God. He's 64. God bless George. I mean, he, you know, I guess he doesn't look that bad  from 64. He's got a scowl on his face. Can you send that photo to Eric or just link it  to the Opie and Anthony Facebook page? It's on facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony. Oh  yeah. You got to see this picture of Travis with George Wentz. I don't even know where  mine is anymore, but I'll know what I may have it on the hard drive. Okay. Yeah. Put 
[03:32:30]  him up there because that was hilarious. Roland, you were with us when, uh, George  went was here, correct? No, I wasn't. That wasn't your book. That wasn't. Did you hear  the clip that we just played? No. I was into the Bruce channel. What's up? What goes on  in your mind? 10 o'clock that channel changes in Roland's office. Nah, I'm going to change  it before 10, but what goes on? That's true. What goes on in your mind when a, when a guest  interview is just going horribly? Like, you know what would be a good example for you? The  Paris Hilton interview. What goes on in your mind when things have just taken a turn for 
[03:33:00]  the worse? I was like, great. I just got fucked in the ass by life. That's how you feel?  Yeah. I was like, great. Let me just figure out how to get out of this fuck hole. Yeah.  And it's, and it's still happening. It's not like, it's, it's not like when you do something  it's over, it still goes on. So it's, as it time ticks, I hear click, click. You're trying  to figure out how to get out of getting fucked in the ass while you're still being thrusted  into. Yeah. And then you have to, then you have like 10 people shoot at you and you have 
[03:33:30]  to answer questions right away. It's not like, can you give me a minute? There's no, give  me a minute. It's like, what's this? Yeah, I do this. Well, luckily in the case of George  went, there probably wasn't 10 people. Well, you probably had one person going, I gotta go.  Yeah. It's just George. I think you, and he was here by himself, right? Yeah. He walked right  in by himself. He's not looking good in these photos. No, he looks terrible. The one in the  studio, it looks like his whole face is just bloodshot. Yeah. He was having a big 
[03:34:00]  night. Well, and it was a rough morning for him. He just had to go through, he didn't  know he was coming in for an intervention. He thought he was doing a fun guy show where  they talk about drinking beers. He didn't realize this was like, George, well, you have  a problem. We care. We are here because, because we love you. But it wouldn't have been an intervention  if he didn't come in looking like he was, you know, bloated over. Yeah. I did ask his  nephew and his nephew went, oof. Who's his nephew? Jason Sudeikis. Really? That's George  Wendt's nephew? Yeah. That's how Jason got started in Second City through his uncle. He 
[03:34:30]  probably keeps that information private. Yeah. Well, do we, is there any, we gotta get Jason  Sudeikis on the show. Yeah. For fucking votes. Oh. I'll be honest. Yeah. Where the fuck's my  votes? I need yeses. Bob in Illinois after Open Anthony Live. George Wendt didn't hear of you  on the NASCAR tally a couple weeks ago. Yeah. He was still honking that shitty book, I think.  He was all fucking hungover. You could tell by your daughter he was ready to die, poor guy. 
[03:35:00]  You want a, you want a, you want a Blu-ray there, Bob? Yeah, sure. What, of what? It's, uh,  Immortals. It's that movie that came out. Mickey Rourke's in it. He's having a comeback,  right? Sure, man. And then Superman. And Superman's in it, too.  Henry Cavill. Comes with digital copy. I don't know what they said about you, Sam. You're  all right. Thank you very much, Bob. I'm gonna put you on hold. See, you give someone  a $10 Blu-ray, you're all right. Yeah, exactly. Finally, I can get some compliments. All I  need to do is give people things. Um, yeah, what's that? It's on the floor now. Um, yeah. 
[03:35:30]  I was looking at my brackets, Travis, because we're still, we're still doing this brackets  thing, right? Oh, yeah. Brackets, brackets, brackets. It's still on. It doesn't end, right?  Somebody's really gonna get a thousand dollars, even though the show hosts are not involved  whatsoever. Oh, yeah. I think the company's contractually obligated. What a waste of money.  Oh, I knew that. Yeah. Well, at least the Final Four's here. Well, I was looking at it  by Tebow Fever. I still got my champion team in... Kentucky? Yeah, I took... No. Or 
[03:36:00]  Kansas. Kansas. I took Kansas. We're not up to the Final Four. Yeah, next week is the Final  Four. Yeah. But we don't know the Final Four teams. Yes. Yes. What are the Final Four? Oh,  Kentucky, Kansas. Yeah. There it is. I shot up to, like, 1,200, I think. I gotta tell you guys  something. Out of the Elite Eight, I had two out of eight. That's 25%. In the Final Four,  I'm out. I'm out. You have nobody? It's up for me. I'm done. My Elite Eight. Syracuse  made it all the way to the Elite Eight, but I had them going, uh... I would check mine, but 
[03:36:30]  I forgot my password and my username. It had to do it. What was your team name? Dick in  the Ass. The real Dick in the Ass, wasn't it? The real Dick in the Ass, yeah. Yeah. I mean,  the Daniel Bryans are officially... The Daniel Bryans. The Daniel Bryans are officially out,  unfortunately. But I guess, uh... How are the B-Sharps doing, Eric? Um, well, I was just doing  the Facebook update. I'm gonna log in right now. That's how much... That's how dumb this whole  thing was. That's how much of a waste of time and money the whole thing was. All of us, everyone  here, has to log in to figure out where they are in the standings. Like, I've hung out with people 
[03:37:00]  who are sitting there watching these NCAA games, and they actually know which of the  two teams playing they have to win. Like, I'll watch a game, and unless it's like Syracuse  or something, I don't know which team I have winning. Wow. Do I have... What number are  you? Um, I am now at 15-59. Uh, I'm winning them 12-20. Oh, I have Tebow fever. I have  like, uh... Tebow! I think I'm in 18-something. You have to be. If all your people are gone. Are 
[03:37:30]  you still in this thing, Eric? Uh, let me... Well, we're all still in. No, I mean, I am  out. The guy in second place, his name is Buttsex. Buttsex. Yeah. That's a rip-off of  Roland's name. I have three of the Final Four. Oh. You do? Yeah. You were right about  this, Travis. Anything can happen in the Final Four. How many do you have left? Two. You  have two. Are they on the same side? Yep. Oh, so that's not good. So the most you could  have in the championship game is one. One. But, what if that's the winning team? Who do you 
[03:38:00]  have winning the whole thing? Kansas. Is Kansas still in? Yeah. Yep. They're  good, too. Are they good? Kentucky is really good. I don't know. That's who I  have to win. You have Kansas winning, too? I have Kentucky to win. One of them will  win. How did you guys... Well, Roland, you actually watched sports. Roland is  asserting that one of these four teams will in fact win. Are you bullshitting you? This  is confirmed. Roland's Lock of the Week. Eric, how did you pick the teams? Norm  McDonald posted his bracket, so I just did an exact copy of his. Oh, Jesus. Norm has 
[03:38:30]  a sports show. Oh, he did for a little while. Eric, do you have any... There he is. I knew  he was going to. I was waiting for him. You were in your bracket talk. Ron Bennington,  the great Ron Bennington, has arrived. Welcome back to After Open Anthony Live. We were just  doing a little sports break for all the people. You know, everybody's got March Madness and  Tebow fever. The illness is unbelievable, but... Did my opening change? Now do you 
[03:39:00]  just say it before the crash? I have to tell you. Could you play the crash? It used to  be like a spontaneous, like, whoa! It was like fantastic at one point. Now it's become this  afterthought. And Eric's excuse... Well, we were talking about brackets, so I couldn't  bring in Ron. True. You understand. Yeah, I understand. That doesn't hurt you at all,  does it? No! No! The fact that you guys are talking about what every other show out there  is talking about? No! I don't want to interrupt that. We have... I love the extra lights in  here, by the way. Are they working for your show, too? Yeah, they're fantastic. I think 
[03:39:30]  they mainly put them in for you guys, really. Yeah. Because you guys were saying, how is  the video element going to play out? Well, we don't do that. We just like to see each other's  makeup look good. But, you know, Roland, today at 12 o'clock, we're probably going to simulcast  when Tim Sanity hits and does his first press conference with the Jets. And they said, this  is the biggest press conference in the history of backup quarterbacks ever. You cannot get 
[03:40:00]  into the normal place. They've had to move it to a field house. They have. Yeah. For the  backup quarterback, Roland, have you seen the back of Roland's shirt? Let's take a look  at it, Roland. You just says Tebow at 15, and then it looks like it's old. Is that the  point of that? No, it's just my first wash did that. One wash. It's just a cheap shirt.  Yeah. Yeah. They made him too fast. But it looks vintage. It really does look vintage.  Donald Sutherland, he goes, did you pay too much money for that shitty shirt? I got to tell 
[03:40:30]  I mean, it's a great Donald Sutherland, though. I thought he was here. Yeah, so did I for  a second. Close your eyes, assholes. Is that your new, is this replacing Lynn Sanity for  you? No, I still got my former Sanity. They're best friends, you know, Lynn Sanity and Tim  Sanity. They are. Yeah, they're both friends in Jesus. That's right. Two religious guys.  I mean, Jesus is taking over New York sports, it seems like. Hopefully, yes, except for he's  not all that good right now. No. We really need some championships. Well, Carmelo Anthony, 
[03:41:00]  I think, kind of seems to have pushed a little of that Jesus out. Are you mad at Carmelo and  Roland? Fuck him. Fuck him, is what he's saying. I mean, it's one thing to be an XL channel,  but let's just not do it for no reason at all. You're right. Now, by the way, Donald Sutherland  has the biggest facial features of any human being I've ever seen in my life. Yeah, and it  only is accentuated by that giant beard, but he's got everything. It's just big on the  guy. It is, and he seems like he, instead of doing this movie, he should have been in 
[03:41:30]  Hogwarts. Now, have you seen this? The Hunger Games? Yeah. Yeah. What'd you think? I mean,  I talked about it a little bit on the Sunday show. Yeah. It's, it's Twilight, you know?  It is Twilight. It's going to do very well. I thought it wasn't. Well, it's already done  gigantic. Yeah. You know, but. I thought that it wasn't, I thought that it was going to be  different. I didn't realize it was, it was Twilight. Yeah, it's Twilight. Yeah. Like  I thought. That's the best thing to say about it. Like, it's just like Twilight. And I don't 
[03:42:00]  know why. Did you see it? Yeah. Yeah. I saw it in a screening room. Very fancy. Yeah.  And we all moaned. We were moaning what was going on. Oh, God. And then when, you know,  you talk to Donald Sutherland, he's like, this is the Occupy movement. This is fantastic.  Think this will start a revolution. Like a lot about. No. No. Then a lot about kind  of what irked me is kind of spoilers. So I don't want to talk everything about it, but  no, I don't want to, but yeah, I guess when it down and then I'll be able to do it. Cause 
[03:42:30]  I saw the film too. And I want to talk to somebody about it. Well, it was the kind of the whole  idea, the uprising didn't exactly pan out. Didn't really even take place. No, it didn't  did it, but it was there. It was potential for it. Right. I guess that comes in second or third,  but I don't go to, then they're not a hunger games anymore. Are they? I don't think so.  You know, at that point we're going to stop the hunger games. Does this chick defend her  title in the next hunger games next year? That would be shocking if she did. Although  she could probably win again. She didn't seem to have too much of a tough time with it. 
[03:43:00]  Well, that's because most of the action happened off screen. Two more people are killed. I was  sitting there and like Jess was describing the book to me and the plot of this movie. And I  said, it sounds awesome. Like little kids, they go and they fight to the death and they  just fuck each other up like crazy. But then I went and I was like, these like, I was talking  about it over the weekend. I was like, these little girls that are lined up for the movie  instead of me using a little bit of intelligence and saying, obviously this is not what I've 
[03:43:30]  expected. I was walking past all these girls like, wait till they see what's going on in  this movie. Right. And then I was like, Oh, you know, I think happened. Jess got you to  take her to a teen flick. Yeah. That's all. She likes the Twilight movies. So after that,  she's probably going to keep lying about everything. You know, like, Oh God, the action that goes  on in sex in the city three, you got to see Valentine's day. There's this giant, there's  a tank in it. But didn't you think like it was a couple of different movies to like the,  the one, like where the, the city people lived, they were all acting like they were in a nineties 
[03:44:00]  Batman film. And then you get out in the other, it just felt like a different movie. It was  very much like a, like penguins Gotham city. And like, have you paid attention to all the  other people who act like they're in some form of reality? Yeah, no, that doesn't make a lot  of sense. Um, but yeah, I, and I actually liked the part before they started the hunger games  better than the hunger games. You liked the, um, the makeover. No, no, no, no, no. Yeah. 
[03:44:30]  There was a long makeover where they go to Oz and everybody's shining their feet and everything.  Well, I saw Lenny Kravitz was, uh, bragging about this and he was doing interviews. Yeah. I'm like,  Lenny Kravitz, you've been in the fucking film three minutes longer than me. You're barely in it.  Yeah. He's doing interviews. Well, yeah. I mean, aside from what's her name, the two,  the girl and the kid, most of the people are only in for a couple of minutes. Stanley Tucci 
[03:45:00]  has a standout role in this thing. But, um, yeah, I mean, I guess I just thought there'd  be a little more adultness to it. There's none. Something like you could imagine what this  movie would be with an R rating. That would be a movie I would see. Well, you know, that's  come up quite a few times is how come bully got the R rating and this thing didn't bully  says the word fuck and hunger games kills kids. Yeah. We don't mind kids seeing children 
[03:45:30]  get killed. Yeah. As long as there's a little romance thrown in there. Now, the other thing,  and of course I'd never say this in front of Mr. Donald Sutherland. No. But shouldn't  you have felt bad when some of those children died and you didn't? No. Like there was no  connection. No. Cause you sat there and you were like, yeah, well, 23 of them got to go.  How many are left? How many are left now? And then, and you couldn't even like, you know,  I think you're supposed to want the kids to upheave against Donald Sutherland. Right. 
[03:46:00]  And then you kind of don't, you know what I mean? No, not at all. It's not really giving  too much away, but it is. It's, it's, the kids are going to love it. I don't think that  you're giving too much away because everybody must have seen it if it made 155 million.  I get, well, unfortunately Donald Sutherland, I don't know if you were listening to the  interview. He walked in here and they were Opie, Anthony and Jim. No, we didn't. Sam  saw it and I'm sitting there holding a camera with no mic in front of my face and he's just  sitting there like, what did I walk into? Um, but yeah, I mean, Roland, you haven't seen 
[03:46:30]  it yet. No, I was watching Naughty Hill over the weekend. I think you will. You'll, you'll  really. Naughty Hill. From what year? Like it was on TV. It was 98. Yeah. It was good. You'll enjoy  it. I think you'll really enjoy Hunger Games. I know. I'm excited because I love like the  Twilight series. Yeah. Take a sandwich because you will get hungry watching Hunger Games.  Oh yes. I stuck a sandwich in there and I broke it out very, very quickly. And how fast  did Woody Harrelson go from a drunk to a lovable guy? I don't, I didn't, you know, this whole 
[03:47:00]  uh, you sons of bitches are about to. Yeah. That bit's been done quite a few times now. Yeah.  No, but what I meant was I liked the part, uh, the tension building up to the fact that  they were going to have to go fight to the death was probably the best part, not the makeover  part. Okay. Before the Hunger Games, before the makeover, that part. I did not have a favorite  part of the film. You didn't. Jess was upset with me too. Cause she was like, well, what'd 
[03:47:30]  you think? And I was like, wow, I didn't really like it. Like if you ask any follow up questions,  I'm going to tell you what I thought. And then she said, well, what didn't you like  about it? And then she, you know, you should have said what I didn't like about it is I'm  not 14. I mean, cause that's the, you know, like if people say to me, did you like finding  Nemo? No, I didn't because it wasn't made for me. I couldn't relate. You know, I don't  know what to say about cars too. Yeah. I'm sure like if I had two kids in the backseat  watching those little TV sets, I'd be like, this movie's great. You don't, you, you don't  stay up with the cartoons. I think it's weird when like I've never, I don't like the 
[03:48:00]  cartoons anymore either. Like even the toy stories, I go, okay. I mean, I guess it looks  kind of cool, but I, if you, when you have kids, uh, when you and Jess adopt, um, then  you will be like back into cartoon world. Cause anything that makes your kids happy, but when  they're not into cartoons, now what weirds me out is like toy story three will be playing  at like 10 30 in the theater and it'll be packed with fucking adults watching it. That's 
[03:48:30]  insane to me. I don't get that either. Roland, you like cartoons. I love them. I watch cartoon  ever too. You do? Yeah. So you watch Scooby Doo, but not new cartoons. Um, yeah. Oh, the  movies I watch all of Pixar is I love. Even the Puss in Boots. I just got on a 3d Blu-ray.  I gave up after Shrek 1. I was done. I do like when I, when Eddie Murphy yells. Yeah. Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  That's my dad. What I like to do is watch that with the, with the fucking screen off. So  I'm just listening to Eddie Murphy. Eddie Murphy yelling. My dad walks around the house  still to this day. I'm looking down Shrek. I'm looking down. Dad. Stop it. He's 12 years  old at this point. Eric, you still watch cartoons. Oh yeah. Now do you, I know you're, you're  really obsessed with the cartoons from when you were a kid, like watching He-Man and stuff  like that on DVD. You watch He-Man on DVD? It's not even funny. No, it's not. It's action. 
[03:49:30]  He-Man, Voltron, G.I. Joe. Mask. Like I could see if you were still watching like Fred Flintstone  or fucking Scooby Doo. I still watch He-Man. It's insane to me. Like picking up on, picking  up on nuances that you might not have picked up when you were a kid, but He-Man is just like  by the castle of Grayskull. By the power of Grayskull. Do you watch with your shirt off? You just  put a shirt on and a plastic short. And then you put in like strips of tinfoil over your  chest, X'd out. By the way, Chris thinks that E-Rock doesn't like him. Chris Stanley? 
[03:50:00]  Yeah. I don't know why. Is that true? I don't know why either. I have no idea. Somebody thought  him a lie, I guess, that fucking E-Rock complains that he mumbles too much on the air. The other  day we went to do something and then we had a meeting and my Twitter's just blowing up.  People yelling at me saying, how do you not think Pepper is funny? It's like, why are you  making fun of Pepper? I'm like, I haven't even said anything. Did you say it on the  air? No. No, he said something very kind to me in the hallway and then I misconstrued  the whole thing. It's just not like you. So Pepper was like, what the fuck? So he could 
[03:50:30]  be, so he could have the excitement and maybe use that as a ringtone, you know, for himself.  Do you feel, Eric, like Pepper doesn't have that broadcast voice that you're so used to?  No, I love Pepper. I think he's great on that show.  So he's the world's biggest. He said to me, he goes, Pepper's everything that Sam's  not. What? What the fuck, Eric? Why the fuck would you say that? That's good. What  the fuck is your problem? I did say that. Oh, your voice started to crack there. You 
[03:51:00]  can't sound that fucking tough. I know. I mean, that's why I don't get it. You should like  the Hunger Games. Oh, shit. Fuck. But you do, so. Oh. That was a fat joke, Roland. It  was? Was it? I didn't, I mean, it wasn't intended to be. By the way, Roland's killing it on Kenny  Powers this season. Just fucking destroying as Kenny's half-brother. I haven't watched this  season, but I'm assuming there's a character that. I cannot, as, as, uh, I think next week 
[03:51:30]  is the finale. And I'm gonna miss this fucking thing like it was an old girlfriend. Is it  still holding on? Oh, God, yes. It was season, I stopped, like, in season two. Why? I don't  know. It's not perfection. I don't know. I mean, it's good. I never stopped liking it,  but it was just like, all right, I think I've seen it. No. No, it's, every season's different.  Yeah. They're in Myrtle this year. It's unbelievable. Yeah. I would imagine. I'm glad Danny McBride  has that going for him. I don't like that the movies that he did, like, he hasn't had 
[03:52:00]  a hit movie. Uh, except that he's been like, you know. That he was the star of? Right. Or  that he was a part of? No, none of his vehicles have been hits. Okay, yeah. What are his vehicles  then? Pineapple Express? No, that wasn't his. He was amazing in that. Yeah, but he was a  bit player in that. He was like a breakout in it, but it wasn't his, he was a breakout.  Like, I'd say he's featured. Your Highness? Drillbid Taylor? Yeah. Did not do well. And I thought  that was funny. By what? You mean the, I mean, critics, box office, whatever scale  you want to use, it didn't do well. Uh, what else? Um. Drillbid Taylor did, all right. 
[03:52:30]  I, I don't even remember it, so I'm. Owen Wilson? He's a homeless guy? Yeah, I'm gonna  have to disagree with you. Um. Foot Fist Way, he was good in, but I don't think the movie  did well. Well, that was his, like, indie movie. And then the other one was. That's what  we got him for the first time here. The Jesse Eisenberg movie. Uh, 30 Minutes or Less.  Yeah. Social Network? Yeah. He was Spider-Man in that movie. Um, no, him, uh, 30 Minutes or 
[03:53:00]  Less with Jesse Eisenberg didn't do anything for either of those two guys. I haven't seen  that one. Nobody has. Yeah. I mean, I'm not, I didn't, I didn't see it. Do you feel bad  as he hasn't taken up the way you want? No, I think. I mean, I can't feel bad for people  for not having hit movies. Cause like most of the people I know don't have hit movies. Yeah,  of it. Like Kenny Powers has the option to have hit movies. Like most people are so far  away. Like Kenny Powers is right there. I feel like he's a step away from having a hit  movie and it just doesn't happen. Aziz, he's got Parks and Recreation, which is, I don't 
[03:53:30]  know. I love him on that. I guess. That show's great. He was in Funny People too. Yeah. And  he was good in Funny People. You know. So what's your point? Aziz is not going to make  it? No, I think Aziz is doing all right. I don't know where this is going. I think  Aziz is doing all right. I think between Aziz and Kenny Powers, you'd rather have Kenny  Powers' career. I don't know. Cause I think Kenny Powers is more like, like Aziz. Hold on.  He writes it. He produces it. Will Ferrell calls him on the phone. Aziz is like what? Fifth 
[03:54:00]  mic on the fucking Parks and Rec show? Yeah, but Aziz has. He's coming in tomorrow, so  he's phenomenal. Oh, Aziz? Then he is great. I'm sorry. He's fucking fantastic. But there's  two things about Aziz. Number one, I feel like Danny McBride is not, he doesn't have  that thing anymore where it's like this guy could be a big star because he's got too many  setbacks. Aziz still has the, this guy could hit the next level at any moment. And.  All right. I'm going to agree now on Aziz cause I found out he was coming in here. And I 
[03:54:30]  don't know if you know this or not, Ron. I do not. Aziz hangs out with Jay-Z and Kanye  West. I don't think Danny McBride can say that. Well, he hangs out with Will Ferrell. I would  rather hang out with Jay-Z and Kanye West. That's cause you're racist. You're racist against  Whitey. No. I'd rather hang out with Will Ferrell. One is better than both. Yes. I never want  to hang out with Kanye West. Just the fact that he's there means you don't want to hang  out with Jay-Z anymore. Yeah. I think, uh, I think Kanye wants you to talk to him. Like, 
[03:55:00]  you go, Hey, shut up. I would want to hang out with Kanye West all the time. I think that  he's too moody and he's going to act like you stole something of his, you know? And Jay-Z,  I think he would be great until his fucking boys came around and then I think that he'd find  ways of picking on you. Oh, so he'd have to be the cool guy. You'd be like, Hey, check  out Sam's hoodie, everybody. It looks stupid. Yeah, this shit looks dumb. He saw the Hunger 
[03:55:30]  Games. Sway saw me in the hallway today and he said, you know, he said, hello. And then  he said, watch out, man. I see you wearing that hoodie. Geraldo says you're going to get  shot. Yeah, we're all safe. Is that why you wore it today? No, I'm just wearing a hoodie.  I've worn this thing a hundred times. Put it up over your head, though. Rob Crawford  is hoodies all the time. See if I were supporting. Do I look more intimidating? It looks like  you're supporting Opie. I don't know why Opie, and I tweeted something about it. He used to  have his group with the hoodies. I said that on Friday, too. That was my actual favorite 
[03:56:00]  thing that's ever happened on Twitter. The hoodies? Yeah. With Big A joined in and started wearing  it and the different people. I'm like, this is so great. If I were Opie, I'd be pissed that  this kid robbed him of his army. You should have said he's part of my stuff. Yeah, you  guys are all supporting me. The million Opie march was going on in New York. But I don't  know. I mean, Opie has not come out with a stance one way or the other. Fez has come  out. I heard the big announcement on whether or not the hoodies stand by. Yeah, Rob Cross 
[03:56:30]  is devastated. He wears hoodies all the time. Does he wear a lot of them? Every day, almost.  Fez. How's Fez doing, by the way? Seems like he's doing great. He kind of likes Roland,  and Roland doesn't know it. He has a crush on Roland? If you were gay, would you be with  Fez? If you were. Depends by the food. Why not? Okay. Well, what's the gayest thing you've  ever done? Have you done anything that approaches gay? The after show. Okay. So yeah, this is  gay. All of us are gay today. We've all been a little bit gay before. Why not? What time is 
[03:57:00]  he's coming in tomorrow, Roland? Nine o'clock. Are you making earlier with Shaq? If you get  the opportunity, would you please just tell him that I thought he was so much better than  Kenny Powers? Yes. And I fucking stuck up for him a million percent. Yes, I will. Well,  on that note, we should let you continue on with your broadcast day. You guys are invited  back if you want to be here for the Tebow announcements at noon. I know. Always feel free. I would love 
[03:57:30]  to. I won't know what he's talking about, but I'm sure Roland will celebrate with you.  Yeah, we're probably going to have a bucket of beer down here until. Beer on ice. Just  going crazy for the new Super Bowl for the Jets go. Tebow fever. Let's go, Jets go. Well,  stay tuned for that. It's all coming up on Ron and Fez. We'll be back with more of this  tomorrow. Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over. For real this time. Check out the O&A show on Facebook  at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony. And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday 
[03:58:00]  from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern. Fun and Fez are next.  Hey! </pre>
