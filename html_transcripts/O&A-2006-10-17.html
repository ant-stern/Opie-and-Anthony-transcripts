<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with an apocalyptic, humorous intro about a rage-inducing virus, immediately transitioning into complaints about their current radio station's management.  They cite a lack of a program director, disorganized administration, difficulty accessing ratings data, and frustration over their reported ratings, which inexplicably include another show's numbers.  A caller, Eric from New Jersey, criticizes the show, sparking a debate about the station's overall performance and the hosts' perceived contribution to its success. The hosts discuss a miscaptioned Daily News photo that incorrectly suggests Greg Hughes has his own show, further fueling their discontent. Mike from Brooklyn calls in to support their reaction.  The conversation shifts to a desire for a better-run station with more successful shows, praising Ron and Fez while criticizing past program directors.  Promotions for their upcoming appearances on *David Letterman* and Jim Norton's solo appearances are aired, along with a segment for a talent show. They detail their bizarre trip to Guantanamo Bay, where Jim Norton performed for the troops, highlighting unusual occurrences. The segment concludes with renewed complaints about station management and hopes for improvement.

The show continues with an anecdote about NASCAR drivers receiving commemorative Guantanamo Bay flags, while Opie and Anthony did not.  This transitions into a discussion of recently fired sports announcers: one for an allegedly racially insensitive joke about Lou Piniella, and Lamar Thomas for inflammatory commentary during a college football brawl.  The hosts debate the double standard in sports commentary.  The conversation then pivots to porn addiction, prompted by a CNN report, with numerous callers sharing personal experiences and perspectives.  A shocking twist occurs when a caller's wife unexpectedly calls in to reveal his two-hour commute was a lie concealing an affair.  The discussion on porn addiction explores varying opinions on its severity.  The hosts briefly mention the video game *Bully*, in which Jim Norton has a role, and touch on Mike Tyson's past, including his alleged hardest punch on Robin Givens.  Further promotion for their *David Letterman* appearance and their "Fatty Pig Fatty Contest" is included.  Actor Brian Cox then calls in, discussing his career, fan interactions, and offering acting advice. Laszlo is present in the studio throughout this segment.

The interview with Brian Cox continues, covering his career, his role as Hannibal Lecter in *Manhunter*, and the coincidental career overlap with Anthony Hopkins.  A segment on the video game *Bully* follows, showcasing and mocking the voice acting of Jim Norton and an intern named Steve.  The hosts and Brian Cox critique Steve's performance.  The "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest is discussed, focusing on contestant Crystal (541 pounds) and attempts to recruit a heavier participant, "Honey," involving negotiations with Honey and her friend, "Bob."  The show includes brief, quirky interactions with a street musician, Laszlo showcasing a video game, a woman selling Greg Norman apparel, and a messenger repeatedly suspected of carrying pornography.  The segment ends with jokes, self-aware comments about the show's potentially offensive and illegal content, and general banter.

The show then presents a possibly fabricated story about a child and a Burger King employee involving injuries and hash browns.  A listener calls in to express enjoyment of *Lucky Louie*.  A significant portion focuses on a scathing review of the show's Chicago ratings in the *Chicago Sun-Times* by Robert Fetter (or Feeder), prompting angry, vulgar responses from the hosts. They repeatedly attempt to contact him unsuccessfully. Listeners call in to express support and contribute to the criticism of Fetter. The discussion shifts to the hosts' diets and bowel movements, detailing a particularly bad smoothie experience.  They discuss attending a comedy show, "Last Pest Standing," planning to air the recording.  The segment concludes with continued anger over the Chicago ratings and complaints about media coverage. The show briefly touches on the media's attempt to cover the birth of America's 300 millionth citizen.  The hosts utilize profanity and sexually suggestive humor throughout.

The final segment opens with a discussion of a comedy show, highlighting both successful and disastrous performances, including "carpet bombing" moments.  They brainstorm incorporating footage into their show, discussing editing and Anne's potential introductions; Happy, described as a "fucking crazy person," is mentioned as a frequent filmer. A major portion is dedicated to John Mark Carr, a former teacher, and his appearance on *Larry King Live*. Opie and Anthony play clips, expressing extreme disgust at Carr and King's perceived leniency towards allegations of child abuse. They use highly offensive language and make graphic, sexually explicit comments about Carr's alleged crimes, mocking Carr's responses and King's interviewing style.  They discuss the possibility of getting Mike Tyson on the show and mention their declining ratings.  The "line of the day" winner, a humorous anecdote about child sexual assault, is announced.  The show concludes with self-deprecating remarks about their lack of a permanent radio home.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202, featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  At the beginning, we knew this was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease,  fills their veins and blood with pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates, and kills this cast?  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct.  I wish the God they weren't. 
[00:00:30]  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and coworkers.  Sometimes it leaves pussules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God Almighty.  We need to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is its phrave?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out. 
[00:01:00]  Here we go.  I'm a boredom.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Time to turn the electricity on. 
[00:01:30]  Power up.  Power up the radio station.  Power up  Jesus age Christ  Because the company gets to save electricity after our radio show 
[00:02:00]  Just turn the thing off  Just turn it off  Turn it off  I don't know how during the entire course of our career  We have been put in this position  What type of penance are we living out here?  We are so sick of working for bad radio stations  We're so sick of it  I don't know how  It would be amazing to work for a station where 
[00:02:30]  Like the whole station has ratings  We can only dream  I've been doing radio since I was 18  And you hear about those radio stations where they're just a mother effer  Right  From morning to night  Powerhouse  Just powerhouses  All the jocks have these voices and they're just kicking ass in the ratings  Yeah  And then there's Opie and Anthony where we just work for one crap hole after another 
[00:03:00]  Just one crap hole after another  We don't even know who the boss is anymore around here  We're like mercenaries  All I wanted was ratings yesterday  I didn't even know who to call  I don't even know who's in charge  I know Tom Chiasano  I thought you were man  I know Tom Chiasano's in charge  But I'm talking about like on the programming side  I didn't even know  I don't know who our program director is anymore 
[00:03:30]  Tom's the boss here  But he's like the boss of the station  To make sure that money keeps flowing in  Yeah he's more the sales boss  The cash flow boss  That looks over the PD  But then there's the show's bosses  You know  Which is the program director  Which we seem to again  Not have one of  Does that happen a lot in radio too?  I've only been in the business 12 years  And I  Based on what I know  From what we've done in the past  Yeah 
[00:04:00]  I don't know if this happens a lot  Does it happen a lot Opie  That shows just don't have program directors  Because that seems to have been our entire career  We're the first show in radio history  That doesn't have a boss  We've never  We're like retarded children at a home  It really is amazing  That's why I didn't really get too close to Mark Chernoff  Who's the program director I guess officially here at Free FM  But I think he stepped down  No I don't think he's even officially  I think right now we are without a program director  Did he step down officially?  I don't even know  I didn't get close to him when we moved over here 
[00:04:30]  Because I just knew he'd be gone too  Gone  I don't know if people  Yeah he's gone  Oh yeah  I was playing  A while ago  He's over at the fan  I see him all the time  With the Iron Man  Oh  Do you see him carrying boxes out?  Yeah we haven't seen him in a while  I don't know  Have you seen him with a box with a plant in it?  Do you see him come in here in the morning and say hi?  Mark?  Yeah  Yeah  Not in the last few days I don't think 
[00:05:00]  Well there you go  Not in the last  It's been longer than that  It's been longer than that  If you really sit down and think about it  So I don't know  But we don't  We uh  Here we are again  Again  Here we are  We  We  We  We  Try our hardest  We really do  Someone is saying  We've shown success  Hans Gruber  On the instant feedback  One effing show where you guys don't complain  One  I effing dare you  You gotta understand our position 
[00:05:30]  Yeah  We are broadcasting from another crap hole  We don't complain all day  So just be quiet  We  Sit back  Enjoy it  Or wait for a little while  And then come back  What can we tell you?  The ratings came out here in New York City  And the Opie and Anthony show  Did very well  Again  Yeah  We went up  It was wonderful  It's a wonderful thing  We're still building  We're still making our comeback 
[00:06:00]  But in general  We're moving in the right direction again  Thank God  We're ticking upwards  Rest of the station in New York  Well that's  Another story  Maybe that's why we couldn't get ratings yesterday  They didn't want  They didn't want anyone to see them  They didn't want anyone to see  I know I had to send five emails  To Mark  Five emails to get the ratings that I usually get  Just automatically sent to me  Yeah  Because I like to see the ratings for the entire station 
[00:06:30]  I don't want to see certain demos  I don't want  I want to see everything  So I can kind of pick it apart  Because the truth of the matter is  We went up  It's a wonderful thing  I love the fact that that's working  People are coming on board  Listening to this program  But the truth of the matter is  The way the paper reports it  It reports our ratings from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.  That's driving Anthony nuts  It's driving me up a wall 
[00:07:00]  It's driving you insane  Because from 9 to 10 isn't us  And I'm not even going to get into what they call a pissing match  I don't have to dump out of that  It's just a term that's used  I don't want to get into one  I'm too tired  To even bother getting into one  I don't care  If the Lord Jesus Christ was on at 10 o'clock  At 9 o'clock here  I don't care 
[00:07:30]  I don't want to share ratings with the Lord Jesus Christ  It's just the way it is  We're sharing an hour of ratings  I hate that  I don't know what the answer is  I don't know what we can do about it  But it's bringing our average down  Well we'll have the breakout today  Where it's 6 to 9 a.m. for us  I want to know what our ratings are  For the show we do  From 6 to 9  From 9 on  That's going to be the new program director's problem  Whoever the hell that might be 
[00:08:00]  And whenever the hell they might show up  Well this is the solution  I say we go to Eric Logan at XM  Because he helped make this deal for us  And we beg him  And smack him in the head  We beg him  I know they don't want us to do another hour  But maybe let CBS run like a best of hour  So then we know it's all us  Yeah  Just throw some stuff together  Throw it on  That's my solution  Or replay the first hour of the show at 9  Do just anything  So we know it's all us  So then we could get a real feel for what we're doing 
[00:08:30]  And we can take responsibility  If we go up or down  It's us  Well we went up again  But we got it  But I look at numbers  And I go  I know that  I know  God damn it  I know that's higher  I know it's higher  And then you look  You know  You look at middays  And go  Oh  Okay  That's a quarter of our ratings  Right there  That's a quarter of our ratings  Right there  And it is  A lot lower than we are 
[00:09:00]  The station would make more money  If they just turned the power off  After our show  To save the energy  They would save on the electric bill  I'm not even kidding  And we were in the same situation  At WNEW back in the day  For a while  And then the station  Yeah  Then the station started growing  But it took like what  Two years  Yeah  Maybe longer  Two and a half years  And we're right back in the same position  We're in the position at AAF  And then it would  You know  I wanted to talk to some kind of PD yesterday 
[00:09:30]  There's  You don't even know who's  Who's in the  In those shoes  Yeah  Who's the guy  We don't know  You got ratings from Mark Chernoff  But  Like I said  It took five attempts at emails  I got them in dribs and drabs at first  Then I started getting  And I still didn't get the sheet  That I wanted  One that he sent for  You know  Other markets  And other things  Right  I'm used to getting those  Are we getting another PD  Yeah 
[00:10:00]  Supposedly  We're supposed to get another PD  But  And people are saying  That we chased out this PD  Oh  Stop already  Don't you realize  We're just too exhausted  To chase people out  Oh I've had it  How many PDs have retired  Because of you guys  Yeah people  It's just frustrating  We just want to work for  A radio station  Where you know  You could kind of brag about it 
[00:10:30]  Yeah  You know  I was having a talk  With Tom Chisano  I told him  Look I gotta be honest with you  I don't listen to the station  You know  After  After our show  I just don't listen  I go  Sometimes I listen on the weekends  Because the music's cool  There you go  And then he was  Hinting at some things  About the weekends  And I went  Oh boy  Oh boy  Oh boy  I started that sentence  Realizing  Maybe he told me some stuff  I'm not supposed to say  I'm not sure now  I gotta ask him  I'm sure  No 
[00:11:00]  You weren't supposed to  I don't know  Let's say hi to Eric  In New Jersey  Eric  Hey what's up guys  What's up  I just want to tell you guys  The rest of the show  Is on the station  I can't wait  Until you guys get off  Because I'd rather listen  To JVNL  With the radio chick  Even Jim Cramer  Than you two  Alright  Do you understand something Eric  Wait Eric  Why didn't  Eric seriously  Stay on the line  Yeah we'd love to discuss this  You write in your comments  Is the rest of the station 
[00:11:30]  Really that bad  And now you  You use that to get on our show  To try to trick us  Do you realize the shows  You just mentioned  Are horrendous  In the ratings right now  Yeah but how many of them  Have been around  If they even came from  The New York area  It's like their first year  In the city  It doesn't  That's not how it works  In radio  Jesus  You don't understand Eric  The way radio works  Which is fine  You're a listener  That's fine  You're not supposed to understand  But you know  It's hard to argue  With people that do understand 
[00:12:00]  The ratings  You live and die  By the ratings  In radio  That's just the way it is  And the  The shows you mentioned  That's fine  If you enjoy them  That's great  But apparently  There's not many people  With you there  We'd love for there to be  Holy Jesus  Would we love for there  To just be a bunch of you  A bunch of Eric  That loves  The other shows  And the station  Is doing very well  Did you  Where do you live 
[00:12:30]  Jersey  Yeah  Can you get the  The post in the daily news  Not yet  Alright well  Try to find them today  And just look at  The ratings of the station  As a whole  And some of the day parts  That they break down  And just look  And get a realistic look  You know  You don't like us  You don't want to listen to us  Fine  Not everyone's going to like us  I hate to tell you Eric  You've got to thank us though  Because if it wasn't for us  Pulling these really good ratings  In the morning  Oh Jesus  This station would probably  Be playing Spanish pop music 
[00:13:00]  Well what about  Before they changed the format  Wasn't that  You know  One of the top stations  In the city then  Dude I have a question  Yeah Howard was on  In the morning  Why are you listening  Howard was on in the morning  And he pulled amazing numbers  And that pretty much  Pulled the station along  They played music  The rest of the day  Which did okay  They weren't  Killing  But they weren't  In the sewer  He hung up  See  They never want to  They never want to  Hang on  And just discuss things 
[00:13:30]  They want to call up  And bitch about something  You know  They don't like the truth  I want to know  Why would somebody  How do you know  What this show  Is talking about  If you don't like it  I would never listen  To a show  I know  He knows everything  Never  Hi Eric  Keep listening  I would never  Listen if I didn't  Like the show  You know what  Yeah I'm in the same boat  I don't listen  On the way home  Sorry  And see  Believe it or not  We want to be working  For a radio station  That has a bunch  Of great shows  Of course we do  From us  All the way to midnight 
[00:14:00]  How much easier  Would it be  That would be unbelievable  But we're in this position  All the time  You can defend  Your favorite show  On this radio station  Right now  The fact is  They're all doing  Horrendous  Horrendous  Just the way it is  And if they didn't  Hire us here  They would probably  Change the format  At this point  Yeah  They would probably  Go to Spanish Pop  Because it seems like  Everyone loves  Spanish radio  For some reason  Yeah there's  Like two Spanish stations  And 18 billion  Spanish people  In New York  And they wonder  Why those stations  Do so well  Right  Gee 
[00:14:30]  I wonder  Steve from Queens  Steven from Queens  Opie  Time to break out  The old promo  From WNAW  Where it was  Static  The Opie and Anthony show  And then back to static  How we end up like this  That was before  Rana Fez  The Rana Fez days  But anyway  Just to help out  What was that guy's name  Eric  Eric  Yeah help out Eric  You can see this for yourself  In the daily news  Overall  The radio station  That you're listening to us on  In the New York area  WFNY 
[00:15:00]  It got a 1.3 overall  1.3  Yeah  And for the people  That don't really understand  What that means  Well  Walk  A radio station  That doesn't even come in  In Manhattan  Yeah try to get it  I dare you  You can't get it in Manhattan  It's a Long Island radio station  Which means  It only covers  Part of the  Of the New York metro  As far as the ratings go  They got a 1.1  A station you can't hear  In Manhattan 
[00:15:30]  Is nipping at our heels  Nipping  Is nipping at our heels  A magey old dog  Okay Eric  We deal with facts here  A radio station you can't  I gotta say it again  That you can't hear  In Manhattan  Is nipping at our heels  A dumb little station  From Long Island  That's how bad this place is  God it's so frustrating  We understand now  It's in a  A rebuilding phase 
[00:16:00]  I guess  That's why they brought us  On board  You know  Well that's fine  But how about  Let's rebuild with a PD  Let's get a PD  Start there  And have a PD  Start with a PD  Like here's something  When your PD decides  To step down  Have someone waiting  In the wings  Yeah that's a good idea  That's kind of like  Having the New York Yankees  Lose Joe Torre  And they just gotta go out there  And play baseball  Just send the team out there  To play while we look  For a new guy  A new skipper  There you go  That's a perfect analogy 
[00:16:30]  That everyone can understand  You can understand that right  Could you imagine  A team going out  Without the coach  Just  Hey  Just play ball  Some dude's like  Going to Dirk Jeter  I want to play second base today  But you can't  Alright  Oh yeah  Yes I can  Who's gonna tell me I can't  You're gonna tell me I can't  We don't have a skipper  Right  That's how it is here  That's a nice picture  By the way  In the Daily News  Don't even  Don't even get started on that  Because I  I came in  To a smiling Travis 
[00:17:00]  Who had to rub that in my face  Like  Like  Like I just  Went on the rug  And he rolled the newspaper up  And smacked me on the nose with it  Anthony  Travis is a little too happy  About what happened today  In  What is that  The Daily News  Yeah  This is Hinkley  Hinkley did his story  Well we used to joke about this  But I guess  This morning  It became real  No we never joked about this  You are not understanding  The problem with this  What about the  There's times when  Your picture's in the paper 
[00:17:30]  And not mine  I don't care about  The freaking picture  That's not the point  See our show's falling apart  It's not the point  We gotta  We gotta bring the  I  We've had  My picture's been in the paper  Your picture  We joke about it  Because it's ridiculous  And that's funny  I don't care  About the picture  Not being in the paper  As long as the show's represented  By either of us  That's fine  The way this is worded  It's the text  Not the picture  It's a picture of Opie  A wonderful picture 
[00:18:00]  Of Opie  And to the left of him  Is a picture of  Steve Harvey  Who I guess has a radio show  Here in New York  I didn't even know  I don't know  Apparently he does  We're too busy  Doing eight hours of radio  A day to know  Look  I'm not even  I'm not even gonna say  Why this is a problem  I'll just read it  Okay  And let the listeners decide  Alright  Early risers  It says  And there's the picture  Of Steve Harvey  And Opie  According to the  Summer Arbitrons

[00:24:30]  But holding the mic the other person's talking into  And looking exasperated  Yeah we'll do that  So anyway  I'm confused  What's going on here guys  We're just  Want to thank everyone that does listen to us on Free FM here in New York City  The ratings were very very good for the boys  Yes  For us  And we appreciate it  And you know  Just stating facts  The show after us  Is just a disaster  And  And it doesn't get much better  Throughout the day  It's just  We want it to though 
[00:25:00]  We do  We so  Want it to  Yeah  Because people think we're  You know  Destructive and all that  Yeah we're the asses  We're the jackasses  Of the station  Because we want  We want to work on a station  Where all the shows are doing well  Are moving up  Are at least you know  Showing life  That's all  I don't  We don't care  If a station in  Or a show in three months  Has to be number one  That's not the point  I would love to work at a station  Where all the shows are creeping up 
[00:25:30]  Just kind of making  Getting listeners every month  And doing things  Every book  But  Oh my god man  We are always in this position  I guess that's why  We were brought in  I guess that is  Because why else  Would anyone hire  The likes of us  We are so difficult  To work with  We're really not though  We got along with  Ron and Fez  Why is that?  That proves everyone's theory  Why the hell  Do we get along 
[00:26:00]  With those guys?  Because they have  More problems  Than people on this show do  They're both  Is that what it is?  Yes  They're both insane  Ron's a kook  And Fez is just  Fez is a loud  Psychopath  And Ron is just  That thousand yard  Marine stare  Saying brilliant things  With a cigar in his mouth  Ron's going to wind up  Biting someone's ear off  Ron's going to bite  The ear off an agent  And be arrested  With blood in his mouth  Ron's just waiting  For the mailman  To come by every day  Just hoping that  The whole payola  Plugola thing returns  That's all he cares about 
[00:26:30]  Just waiting for his envelope  He's just sitting there going  I know it  It's going to turn  In our favor again  I just know it  I don't know  I don't know why  It's not even like  I just like those guys  I love them  Love them as people  In a show  And I don't understand  Why that is  And we can't  Get that with  Any other program  And there's no secret  We want Ron and Fez  On this station here  Of course we do  Who wouldn't  And even Ron and Fez  They're stupid enough  That they said  They would do  Two different shows  They're stupid enough  To do what we're doing 
[00:27:00]  No we're not stupid  We said  Yeah you can have us  But you got to simulcast  Oh split us up  They'll do two separate shows  They're more than willing  To do two separate shows  To make it work for them  Hardest work in show  And show business  Completely two different shows  Every day  They were very popular  Here in New York  When they were on  Come on  Yeah  There in D.C.  Well yeah  Gotta love the Ron and Fez  Alright well  They're Fez  We gotta take a break  So there's our little 
[00:27:30]  Ratings wrap  We do it when the ratings  Come out  So bear with us  Okay we've stopped whining  So stop your whining calls  About us whining  Yeah  You know  We're a little frustrated  Here in New York  Oh by the way  Chicago the Opie and Anthony  Show got a 0.0  It's the ONA virus  Spreading across America  I can walk on my hands  I can fart and chew gum  I play the Ova  I can ride a unicycle  I wear a bra  Laced panties  So your talent is being  Queer Travis

[00:29:00]  Just want to remind people  You got to vote for  Jerry Springer tonight  Yes  On Dancing with the Stars  On ABC  Put Jerry over the top  So far so good man  We've had a major effect  On the TV show  A major effect  They're booing every week  When Jerry Springer  Doesn't get voted off  That's what we want  We want Jerry to dance  Till his kneecaps are bleeding  I say Ron and Fez 
[00:29:30]  Ron and Fez  I say  You know who I say?  I say Kid Chris  Kid Chris  I say Kid Chris  I say Ron and Fez  Start there  Wherever the PD is  Start there  PD Greg Opie Hughes  What?  That's  Oh hi Tom  I'm shaking his head  There he is  He's like come on  Give me a break  Alright  You look very snazzy today  Oh look at Tom  No no no  You don't want him to come in  Tom's like  Oh boy  I have two words for you 
[00:30:00]  Neither of which can be said  On terrestrial radio  Oh Jesus  Two words  Neither of which can be said  On terrestrial radio  Uh oh  I think Tom's angry  He's angry  Why?  Well we're frustrated  Everyone's frustrated  Everyone around here is frustrated  What can I tell you?  That's the way it works  Ah  And now  Now he just made us all sad  No he's wrong  The word you can be said  On terrestrial radio 
[00:30:30]  That's true  One of the two cannot be said Tom  Yeah  You is fine  You can say you  But now we're sad  But then again  Wait  No no  Off can also be said  Yeah  Oh wait  But maybe not  Hmm  If the first word is ending in I-N-G  Yeah  No probably not  Alright  Why would the boss do that?  Now he took the energy out of the room  Now we're sad  Mother  Say that  I know what he wanted  He wanted to say silly geese 
[00:31:00]  You can say that on radio  It's allowed  And why does he look at me and say it?  I'm not  Hey look at the paper  Did you see the paper yet?  Did you see the paper?  Oh now you're gonna say  What is he supposed to talk to me?  Now you're gonna say  It's your show  Look how this works  Look how this works  Steve Harvey and Greg Hughes  He looked at me and cursed me out  But now  Why shouldn't he?  Yeah thanks Ed  He's just paying attention to the paper  But see that's not smart  What? 
[00:31:30]  As the big boss  That's not smart  Because now the energy's out of the room  Now we're sad  No there's plenty of energy  You don't want your big boss cursing you out  As you're trying to do a radio show  Maybe the words he wanted to say were  Thanks guys  You rule  Those are the two words  Because he didn't want to offend any other radio program  What does he  Thanks guys  Why does he curse out the only show that's getting ratings?  Attaboy  He didn't curse you out  Oh yeah he did  He looked right at me  And I could tell  I'm trying to think of two words  Gay tie  His head was shaking like Hepburn too 
[00:32:00]  Oh he did not look pleased  Oh he was shaking his head  He's gonna come back  He's gonna come back  No  Ah a little frustration in the building today  A little bit  Can you feel it?  No  Why aren't we allowed to speak our minds about this?  It's frustrating  I guess we are  Because we did  Two words that can't be said  Two words  This is gonna bug me all day  Well maybe  Sounds like  Mother 
[00:32:30]  Duck  But you could even say mother  Of course you can  You could say mother blanker  Blank you is probably what he meant  He probably really was  But he was so upset that he forgot that he can say you on radio  He's got to keep a certain decorum  I think it was something ing space ass something  I think that's probably what it was  Oh I got ya  Yeah  Wow  Those you can't say both words  Right  That would be a bad thing  Right 
[00:33:00]  Either one is bad in any context  Right  But I don't think those are the words he was thinking  I know the words  Good job  How about a good job for the show  Pat on the back  That's what I want  How about a pat on the proverbial back  Good job  Good job  I don't think that was it either  I know what it was  This is like deja vu all over again  We always got yelled at in the old days  And we were the only ones getting the ratings  I know what the words are by the way  It's right here 
[00:33:30]  What is it  Let me yell it  Hold on  What  Oh no  You're going to yell at him  No  No of course not  I'm going to yell the words  Okay  Wait he's going to yell through the soundproof  Are you going to yell it in the soundproof booth  No  No he's acting  He's acting  He's an actor you know  Alright Jimmy's  I'm kind of getting characters  Alright Jimmy's in the dunking booth  What are you doing  Attaboy  That was it  It's acting 
[00:34:00]  Anthony you're more logical than me  What were we supposed to do today  What were we supposed to do today  It's in the paper  It's on the New York Radio message board  It's on other message boards around America  The sleeping on the billboard thing  Yeah  We talked about doing  Yeah let's do that  That'll get to us  Are we supposed to just ignore this  Yeah we're supposed to ignore it  Like it doesn't exist  Because we're that type of show  And we've always been this kind of show  Where we just cover it up 
[00:34:30]  And don't talk about it  Of course we talk about it  It's in the papers  People bring it up  Well the look on Tom's face  Bill might be right from Waterford  Bill from Waterford  Writes on the instant feedback  I got it  F-ing C's  Oh that could be too  Good  Good one  Tom's too much  It would be A  The second part would start with A  Yeah  It's just not his nature  He's a gentleman  Yeah he's a gentleman  He's a gentleman  If I may be permitted 
[00:35:00]  He's snazzly dressed  Yes  He wouldn't speak that horribly  I would think it  But he wouldn't say it  I would suggest we do two hours commercial free  At this point  Because as soon as the mics go off  Oh no that's right  And I was just going to predict the future  That I see an after show meeting  I see an after show meeting  Have fun  But I see an after  We're done with this segment meeting  I'll turn the mics right back on  Oh no  We gotta protect ourselves somehow 
[00:35:30]  Just leave them on in the background  While the spots play  And you  You  I know what words you want to feel  What?  Eric's fired  Sorry  I don't even know what he does  Someone's head has to roll  He's safe  Job  Or no job  Alright well 
[00:36:00]  We'll move on  Yeah let's  Let's move on  To everything we had planned  For the day  As if this was just another day  God forbid  We state the obvious  God forbid  Yeah  We even stated the obvious  About Chicago  Not allowed  We even said that  In Chicago  The ratings are still not happening  No  But we've only been on  In Chicago what?  A month?  A month and a half?  Yeah it was like a month  We could officially say  It's not our fault still  And it doesn't count 
[00:36:30]  Yeah  It's pretty much still  The  The old numbers  We'll wait  We'll wait  To see what happens  In the fall for that  Alright let's say how to  Coke Logic  Coke Logic  Hey what's going on boys  Hey  Hi  Yeah I've noticed  There's been billboards  There's been the commercial  Yeah  I'm just wondering  Is there some sort of  Glitch in the system  That is still a 0.0  For Chicago  I mean  Well I was just joking  I mean it might as well  Be a 0.0  I mean we got something 
[00:37:00]  Oh there has been a bump  Well I wouldn't call it a bump  Maybe like a  The start of a pimple  Maybe  It was a boo  Maybe  Yeah  A little boo  But the way things work  In the radio world  We haven't been on  Long enough  Right  We didn't start  The same time we started here  And  A lot of that  That bit of the ratings  Aren't even ours  So  I hear ya  We gotta wait  Yeah  Now next one  That'll be ours 
[00:37:30]  And there'll be no excuses  I predicted 11 share  We officially have an excuse  For Chicago still  Yeah officially  We do  Alright  We have an excuse  As long as we have an excuse  So the excuse today  Coke Logic  Too early to tell  For Chicago  Yeah  I had a question for Jimmy  You may ask it  Welcome back  Thank you  Are you gonna move the date  On your Zanies gig  For what  For Chicago  No but why would I move  The Zanies date  Boring  No but why would I 
[00:38:00]  Why would I move  The Zanies date  I  Heard you say that  On the radio  Boring  Well sorry  But I will  Address it now  Okay  Alright thank you  That was exciting  For everybody  In the country  Coke Logic  Nice  Alright  How was Cuba Jimmy  Um  Cuba  It was good  It was uh  Nice  How'd you get there  You two were lollygagging  Enjoying the freedoms  Provided by our boys  Right  Fagging around  I was down there  Risking my life 
[00:38:30]  Risking your life  Yes  Uh  We flew into  Jacksonville  And we uh  Stayed the night  At a place called  The Naval Lodge  Which is like a little  On base  Ooh  It's awful  Does it look like  A big belly button  Oh  Like a hell  You make a naval joke  Why not  It's a nice little lot  No it's a cute little motel  If you want to  Murder a prostitute  Wait you fly into  Jacksonville  Really  Yeah it really is  Uh it's an awful  Little motel  On the  You fly to Jacksonville  And do their regular  Uh  Uh  Airport 
[00:39:00]  And then you  Take a taxi  To the naval base  And the military  Is a nightmare dude  If you wonder why  Things  And Jeff pointed this out  If you wonder why  Things aren't going well  In Iraq  Do something with the military  It is  We have to get up  I think it's 7 o'clock  For an 11 o'clock flight  Like they pick you up  They want you at the airfield  At 830  Oh 700  Oh wait 30  Yeah I guess  2,200  40  Yeah they want you  To the airport  They want you there  Three hours  Before you take off 
[00:39:30]  And there might be  50 people on your plane  It's a nightmare  What type of aircraft  They got an ATA  They rented a commercial airliner  Oh  7.57 to fly us down  And uh  We weren't treated like kings  I'll tell you that much  No  We were thrown in road  32A  32B and C  There was a first class  They didn't put us in that  Was everyone else  Dressed like a soldier  Uh no  There were soldiers  There were some higher  They're very casual  In Guantanamo  It's like a lot of people  Don't wear uniforms there  I noticed  Yeah  Yeah  That's nice  Who was in first class  To Cuba 
[00:40:00]  It was a business class  I think it was a couple  Of officers  High ranking officers  Probably a few Canadians  Yeah  There's still a lot  Of go there  High ranking  Yeah man  We got down there  And uh  The show was decent  You know  I mean  A lot of the higher ups  Didn't like me  I could tell  The commander  Of the base  Didn't like me  The XO  Who's  His guy under him  Didn't like me  I was a little too vulgar  For them I think  Uh  But the soldiers enjoyed it  Of course they did  That's what they like  They get a little weird  When I start talking about Islam 
[00:40:30]  It's really weird  Like in the military  There's so much  Jeff pointed out again  Jeff again  But he pointed out  That there was so much  Sensitivity training  So you could feel them  Pull back a little bit  Like oh I better not laugh  I'm gonna get  My career will end  Yeah it was really  Like an odd  And they laughed  But it was like  You could feel  It get like a  Slightly uncomfortable  I guess cause there was  Commanding officers and stuff  And you know  So I just lapsed into  My filthy porn material  Much to the enjoyment  Of the soldiers  And the abhorrence  Of the uh  Anybody who's like  A non-inlogger  Listed man  Got repulsive 
[00:41:00]  It was an enjoyable time  You know  You don't feel like  You're in Cuba though  You feel like  You're in the States  You know  Technically it's part  Of the States  No it's not  No?  No it's rented Cuban land  Rented?  Yeah  I thought we got that  After we decided  We weren't gonna invade them  They had to give us  Some property over there  And they decided  That they were gonna  Take their missiles away  We know  We've been on in Cuba  Since  We've been on in Cuba  Boy that's not Freudian  We've been in Cuba  Since like  Late 1800s  How do they not 
[00:41:30]  Just throw us out then?  Because there was a lease  We rented it  And I don't know why  They didn't throw us out  During the Cuban Missile Crisis  But they  You know Christopher  Columbus landed there  For a day  And then  For a day  Dummy  Didn't think there was  Any fresh water there  So he went on  To his next  Rape slash abomination  Nice job Columbus  You didn't think  There was anybody  So he went and  Discovered Jamaica  And then he discovered  This guy finds a lot of  Places where people  Are already there  Maybe he could  Come here  And discover some  Listeners  For the rest of the  Station  Hey hey hey 
[00:42:00]  Two words for you  Bubba  Tom that was  Jimmy Norton  Look at him next time  Um  Why do you have to  Look at me  I don't know  You guys should face  The boof  Look at the paper  The paper  Face the boof  I'm not gonna look  Over there  He's looking  He's right there  Is he waiting  No he's  Oh god  So Cuba was good  The base was good  Is there a Starbucks  On the base  Uh  They do serve  Starbucks coffee  There's a McDonald's  On the base  Aww  Um  They have the golden  Arches and all that 
[00:42:30]  Yeah yeah yeah  What  Drive through  Uh  There's probably  9,000 people  On the base  Since uh  Since 9-11  There used to be like  2,000  And then they had  Old Camp America  Set up  Mmm  Um  Which is where  All the detainees  Are stored  Ah you didn't go there  Yes we did  You did  Yeah  Did you get to  Kick them or anything  Or have some fun  You don't get near  The detainees  But the fact that  We got into that camp  I had an idea  For you  Which would have  Been really fun  You get yourself  A leash  And you get one  Around the neck  With a leash  And build a pyramid  Out of them  Naked  And then smoke a cigarette 
[00:43:00]  And point at them  Believe me  I would have done  Nothing but Lindy England  Jokes  If they didn't back out  On the Islam stuff  They got really  A little tense  And I was like  Alright I understand  What's going on  Taking it back  And they'd probably  Just been beating them  No they wanted to laugh  They sell shirts  I bought Guantanamo shirts  For people in this room  I'll bring them  I got them  I got them  I didn't bring them  Because I was rushing out  But they have some other ones  That they will only sell you  As you're leaving the island  Where it's like  You know  They have like  A bunch of rats 
[00:43:30]  Being drowned  You know  Al-Qaeda references  And funny shirts  And the reason  They can't sell them anymore  Is because the  Pukey  Do-gooder  Red Cross  Was there  And thought that  That was too racist  Or whatever  They're Taliban fighters  These are not victims  They're Taliban fighters  Yeah  Being imprisoned  And you can't sell shirts  That kind of depict them meanly  So what they do  Is as you're leaving the island  You know  Four hours earlier  Than you have to be anywhere  You're you know  While gathering  Like a bunch of creeps  In this little area 
[00:44:00]  Being checked off  You have to write down  Your order  And they give it to you  At the airport  At the naval station airport  Like it's a drug deal  It's like a dope deal  With naughty t-shirts  Are they funny shirts?  They're alright  I mean you know  For you know  No big deal  Yeah did I howl  No  Did they take you for a ride  In the middle of the night?  No  You can't leave the base  You cannot  See I lost that bed  I go Jimmy I bet you there's a way  You cannot leave that base  I bet you there's a way  Where they take you  For a little ride at night  To check out some stuff  You cannot leave the base  We just  They basically  Took us to Camp America  But when you pull into Camp America 
[00:44:30]  There is literally  And I'm not exaggerating  On the fenced off area  Where they keep the detainees  There's a sign  Every ten feet on the fence  That says no photography  You cannot take pictures there  So we went to where  The food is served  You know  We went in and talked  To some soldiers  I went out to  To go to the bathroom  They took my camera  Before I left the building  To walk fifty feet  To the bathroom  Really?  They won't let you  Leave the building  With your camera  So they're really strict  And then they told  The detainees  Get the same ice cream  And food that the soldiers get  And I wanted to throw up  And that would probably  I wish Ozzy would have been there 
[00:45:00]  On your way to the bathroom  You without your camera  What are the odds?  What are you doing man?  I'm here to entertain the detainees  All right  Jim would have been the guy  Getting shot  Like being shot  Because he's taking a picture  Right  We should take a break  And then I had a 17 hour  Travel day yesterday  All right  We'll talk about that  When we get back  Oh it's a big teaser  For the folks  How's that sound?  Sounds great  Is the boss gonna curse us out  During the break? 
[00:45:30]  Yep  Guaranteed  Why?  Because  What's going on?  Nothing yet  Anything?

[00:48:00]  Was like  Yelling at me  Or something  It's just so weird  Aren't we grown men  At this point  I said no  Don't ever mistake  Yourself for that  As long as you have  This job  We have the only jobs  In America  Where like  You get yelled at  Like you're a kid  Yeah  Yeah like in business  When the boss  Comes to your cubicle  He'll discuss things  For the most part  Like you're an adult  And you know  If you screwed up  You know  You get a talking to 
[00:48:30]  As an adult  Right  But yeah  We get  We get yelled at  Like your father  Comes in  And then we have to  Go on  I'm sorry  Oh gee  I don't know  What to say  I won't miss curfew  Again  I don't know  What to say  Alright  Next time  I'll ask  Before I take your car  I learned it from you  Okay  I learned it from you  Alright  I'll mow the lawn  Just always awkward  Yeah  So Jimmy 
[00:49:00]  It took 17 hours  To get home yesterday  It was just  It was an abomination  Yeah  They make you wake up  At 645  To leave your luggage  Outside  Me and Tony Woods  Shared a townhouse  It was me  Tony Woods  Jeff Ross  They gave us townhouses  We split on base  They have really nice facilities  They do that for visitors  So you have to put your luggage  On the front lawn  Or on the porch  For them to pick it up  At 7 in the morning  We get picked up at 8  Guantanamo Bay  Is split into like  Two halves  And there's like  A ferry that takes you between  So we have to go to the ferry 
[00:49:30]  We finally get over  To the air station  For an 11 o'clock flight  Our bags come there  At 10.30  We just check our bags  Right there  Like you understand  We have to wake up  An hour early  Leave our bags  Outside the porch  And then they just  Meet us there  Three and a half hours later  We fly to Jacksonville  And I'm sitting  Of course next to my new friend  You know  Got this like  You know  Helicopter security president  Yeah you know  Just talking  Inviting me to the White House  You know how it is  He makes new friends  And we got yelled at  Yeah no no  You're making new friends 
[00:50:00]  And we got yelled at  Nah he's just  He's a good guy  He just wants to see  If I want to come  For a White House tour  You know  You know how it is  You can go  To the White House  Well it all depends  On what wing  I want to see  Like he's not really  Doing the helicopter security  Anymore  He's more in the  Like advanced planning  You know  25th amendment stuff  You know  That type of stuff  Like if the president  Gets hurt  What they do  You know the stuff  That you have to do  High up in the government  Those are the kind of friends I have  And he said  Well basically he was saying  That if I want to come  For a tour of the White House  To give  Like I think it's like  A two week notice  So they can do a background check  Can I  Can I go 
[00:50:30]  Well it all depends  Because now he says  I want a tour of the West Wing  Then you probably need  Like almost like  A two month notice  Two months  The security check  Yeah well that's where  The president hangs out  You might bump into him  That's like a huge security check  Hey hey  Jimmy Norton  Hello  Lucky Louie  How great would that be  That would be the finest moment  Of my life  If all three of us were there  And he happened to say  That I liked Lucky Louie  But he wasn't  I love you  You're funny  So that's what I did  And then we land in Jacksonville 
[00:51:00]  And we had a nice 5-10 flight  Which was delayed  Because of the weather  In Houston  Six hours  There was a six hour  Flight delay  On my plane  Well because the plane's  Coming from Houston  Those weather swamped them in  They couldn't get from Houston  They're in hell down there in Houston  Yeah  I saw the flood water  Oh yeah  Brutal  Yeah  Oh I thought you meant  The Katrina evacuees  Okay  The weather  Yeah  Yeah  I thought maybe the plane  Was up on blocks  At the terminal  When you got on it 
[00:51:30]  Yeah there's 5,000 people  Living in it  Yeah and uh  So me and Jeff  Just last minute  I hate panicking at airports  We ran over to Delta  Bought tickets last minute  To fly  My car's at Newark  To fly into LaGuardia  Because I was afraid  I was going to miss  Today's uh  Festivity  Yeah man  I was going to miss  The show  Talking to  I thought yeah  I was afraid  I was going to miss  Today's scolding  I flew home  For a scolding  I ran through the airport  I've never run through  You know me  I'm Ernest Early  Of course you are 
[00:52:00]  I'm Oscar on time  I'm Pete Prepared  I'm Frank First in line  You know  I'm Elmer Elite  I don't like to be Larry Late  No  No  I don't want to be Ralph  Never  It was  We bought tickets  We were so annoying  The lady at the Continental desk  That we switched to Delta  The fat lady that worked  For Continental  Actually took the escalator down  And went and got our bags for us  To guarantee that they were  On the Delta plane  We bought at 530  We bought  540 
[00:52:30]  We bought tickets  For a 630 flight  We had to be checked in by 6  The guy was actually  Very nice for Delta  Checks us in  And because we bought  Our tickets last minute  That's apparently  A huge security risk  So we have to go  Through the orange line  The orange line  We have like a giant orange  Ticket with you  Which means extra security  Oh boy  615 for 630 flight  That must be nice  To walk around with  Yeah  Like uh oh  615 for 630 flight  I'm like sir  We're not going to make our plane  And he's like  Well I can't do anything about that  Those TSA workers  Are for the most part  Scumbags 
[00:53:00]  I know you guys got a job to do  And it's brutal  But you are  Detached scumbags  And thank god  One of them decided  One of the passengers  Let me go in front of him  A nice passenger  So yeah  You can go in front of me  Hey hey hey  You're being a little negative  I don't want to be yelled at  By anyone else today  Yes  Two words for you  Yeah  Terrorism  So we actually  I got to stand  In that new machine  That new one  That zips  That blows air on you  Those new  It looks like a Star Trek portal 
[00:53:30]  And it's supposed to  Like if you have any  Explosive residue on you  Or anything  It blows it into some sensors  That's what it must have done  Because it was blowing air all over  And I actually wanted to go through again  Because I felt  I felt if I may  Vivacious  Refreshing  Refreshed and vivacious  Did you get that feeling?  What?  You know like when you were  Climbing the ropes in gym class  What?  You get a little tickle  Oh oh  Did it tickle your area?  Oh no  No no no  I had on heavy thick jeans  Yeah  I don't know what I wore  Short pant  Short pant  They just want to check out your package 
[00:54:00]  They blow so much air at you  Yeah they blow your sweatpants back  So it just showcases everything  It's like wow  That guy's wagging  So we made this flight  We're not talking explosives  What did you just get on  And they shut the door?  Oh I was  I've never heard this before  As I'm running  A final boarding call  As I'm running through the  I've never heard that before  You're always relaxed  Sitting  Reading  I'm always kicking back  Perusing the newspaper  You're sleeping sometimes  At that point already  So we got on  We made a home 
[00:54:30]  I was afraid of missing the show today  Because I was afraid  They were going to cancel the flight  Yeah  And I got to tell you  I did it with Jeff and Tony  Tony Woods is one of the funniest people alive  Yeah  I forgot  He is one of the funniest people on the planet  So hopefully if he's in town  He's just  He's a great comic  I had to say that  Because I forgot how great he was  Yeah we'd love to have him  Come by  Yeah  That's my whole Guantanamo story  Not much to tell  Really?  How big is the base?  Can you look across it?  No no no  It's like 40 square miles  40 square miles? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah 40 square miles  Oh okay  And again it's split by a bay  So you take a ferry from one side to the other  It's  It's  They have a beach  They have a beach  Yeah they do actually  They have a nice beach  Yeah  And they have these little crabs  Land crabs  Banana rats  We saw giant lizards  It really was creepy  Crawling around  They have salmonella on their skin  And they're crawling around the restaurant  On the tables  Which was nice  Yeah  They met the base commander  These two NASCAR guys came down  Really  Oh  You want to talk about what a  This is who I am  And this is what a douche I am  They have 
[00:55:30]  For the two NASCAR drivers  Who came one day  They came  We were there  We were there  Friday  Saturday morning  Till Monday night  Or whatever it was  Monday morning  And the two NASCAR drivers  Came one day  And the base commander  Has a big ceremony  For the NASCAR drivers  He has a big flag  That was on Guantanamo  It's in a  It's in a  It's in this like  Piece of wood  That they've made  And says this flag was flown over Guantanamo  And they present it to you  And the photographers are snapping photos  And then he gave one to Jeff Ross  And then me and Tony 
[00:56:00]  Just kind of sat there  Eagerly awaiting our flags  Oh no  And we didn't get them  They never came  They never came  No I didn't stand up  Your flags never came  But I really did think I was getting one  And after Jeff Ross  The base commander looked at me a little bit  Oh no you made the move  I did  I did this with the chair  You made the move  To get up  And get your non-existent flag  I thought  Because the NASCAR guys got them  And then they said  To Jeffrey Ross  So I'm like 
[00:56:30]  We're all going to get these special things  Presented by the base commander  Why didn't you get one  Why would I  Yeah  So I pushed the chair back  Ready to get up  And then that was it  There was no more  What a Ralph Cramden moment that is  Thank God I didn't  Here it comes  My fortune  Thank God I didn't stand up  I want to thank the base commander  For my flag  He didn't like no  Sit down Ralph  They were all polite though  The base commander didn't like me 
[00:57:00]  Alright  Well  Very good Jimmy  Good to have you back  Oh  Glad you made it  Out of the  Out of the S as they say  They fired another  Sports announcer  Yep  Yeah they're dropping like flies  I guess in sports  You can't have an opinion either  Nah  No opinion  No uh  They'll give you a talking to  And then boot you out the door  Yeah  When we had the guy yesterday  We talked about him  That was just dumb  Yeah  They're the Spanish 
[00:57:30]  Yeah  They're talking about  Lou Piniella  It was so innocent  In his wallet  It was a call back  To something that was said  Earlier in the broadcast  And apparently  Piniella was laughing  At it  Yeah whatever  Well did they rehire him  Or is he done  Done  Of course  He's done  Well this is why  The guy got fired  For this  Yesterday  It was Steve Lyons  Just in case you weren't  Listening yesterday  And uh  Now what was the wallet call back 
[00:58:00]  Was he saying because he was Spanish  He ripped his wallet off  Or was there something else  So tied in  Lou Piniella said something  About a wallet  Uh  And it was some kind of 
[00:58:30]  A really stupid analogy  To baseball  And he brought up a wallet  So the guy was just saying  Like look at  Look at  Lou's acting like an ass  Over here  And I'm still trying to  Basically figure out  What he was talking about before  It had nothing to do with  Real  Well because he was  No it was kind of a  Hispanic  Oh okay  He doesn't want to  You know  He's talking Spanish  So his wallet's missing  Kind of a thing  That was okay  Doesn't want to  Doesn't want to sit next to the  Hispanic guy  With fear of  His wallet being stolen 
[00:59:00]  He should  But what does he expect  In this climate  What a dope  Of course  What do you expect  You should be allowed  To say stuff like that  Of course  You should be encouraged to  But  He uh  He should have known better  Yeah what a dope  You can't say things like that  You'd be thrown out  Well uh  We saw the big fight  Over the weekend right  In that football game  No  You didn't see the fight  I had no communication  With the states at all  The video is amazing  I was in a communist country  It was an all  It was an all out brawl  At the Orange Bowl  All out brawl 
[00:59:30]  One guy takes his helmet off  And whacks the other guy  In the back of the head  Or in the back of his neck  Or whatever  They're stomping on one of the players  Kicking him as he's down  Oh  It was an all out brawl  It wasn't one of these little  Squirmishes or whatever  And  Squirmishes  Squirmishes  And uh  Well the announcer said something  During the melee  And he got fired for it  This is what he said  Horrible violence  All over the field  And it starts to point  In any particular direction  Now the 
[01:00:00]  Metrodade police  Trying to restore order  And that's what I'm talking about  You come into our house  You should get your behind kicked  You don't come in the  OV playing that stuff  You across  You across the ocean over there  You across the city  You can't come over to our place  Talking noise like that  You get your butt beat  I was about to go down the elevator  And get in that thing  Oh boy  The guy's a bit excited  Oh boy  That guy was  That guy  I thought that guy was a player  He was an announcer 
[01:00:30]  Yeah  Beat it  What do you think  Is going to happen for that  Scram  He's excited man  It's an all out brawl going on  Yeah but he's really encouraging  I thought he was a player on the field  Talking about why they beat up  The other team  Yeah  He's the local guy though  I think  He's the local announcer  He wanted to jump in  Yeah he wanted to take the elevator down there  This is what happens  When you come into our town  What our  Yeah maybe  Maybe that's not what should happen  Maybe it's good sportsmanship  Here's the story 
[01:01:00]  Saturday's mid-game brawl  Between the University of Miami  And Florida International University  Claims it's first off the field  Victim Monday  When Lamar Thomas  A former Miami player  So he's a former Miami player  He's got a vested interest here  Who cheered the fight on  From a broadcasting booth  And even threatened to join it  Was fired from his announcing job  He didn't threaten to join it  He was just joking  He got caught up in the moment  And got excited  Yeah but you're not supposed to get caught up  In a moment like that  That's supposed to be a horrific thing  That you're supposed to just sit there 
[01:01:30]  And go  This type of thing  Does not belong in sports  Ah they all got  This is  Not good  The children may be watching  Very shocking  That we see this  You're not supposed to sit there  And  Guy sounds like a gangbanger  Yeah  That's what happens  When you come into our house  Yeah our house  Do ya  That's our turf  Well they showed up  Turf  Do they still say turf  I don't know  1962  Talking like a  Beretta episode  What an ass I am  He wants to go down there  With his knife  And throw it from his left hand  And then back to his right 
[01:02:00]  With his left hand  And then back to his right  And wear his denim jeans  Cuffed with white socks  And black shoes  We'll put a kerchief  Between our teeth  So we can be  A close range  When we stab at each other  Is that what they held  Their teeth  You see that one yeah  You put like a  A kerchief  Or a bandana  In your teeth  And the other guy  Would put it in his teeth  And you  You'd have a knife fight  A close range  What if you let go  And you're a pussy  I would have let go  Well if you let go 
[01:02:30]  Then apparently  You had the chance  To put it back  In your mouth  But you didn't let go  It was part of the honor  Of the knife fight  But what if you didn't  Like the way it was  Pulling on your teeth  Or if you felt  It was bad for your bridge  It goes on here  We got good news here guys  Comcast Sports Southeast  Fired Thomas from his job  Doing color commentary  On Hurricanes games  And will edit  His fiery remarks  During the brawl  From a replay  Of the telecast Wednesday  Are they going to edit out  The fight too  Probably 
[01:03:00]  I think the fight  Is a lot worse  Than what the guy said  I bet they edit the fight  So if you're going to edit out  What he said about the fight  You might as well  Just edit out the fight as well  I bet they do  They're not going to edit out  The fight  That's going to drive ratings  I don't know  I don't know  That's a tough call  I bet they edit it out though  So they're going to  I bet they do  I say they don't  Pinky bet  But then all of a sudden  It's just going to be dead air  Where the guy was commenting  About how he wanted to join  You know where that pinky goes  That really makes a pinky bet 
[01:03:30]  Worthwhile  When the head stomping  Helmet swing and brawl  Erupted during the third quarter  Thomas not only  Repeatedly cheered UM  On but said he wanted  To join them in taking  A shot at the FIU team  And then they  Basically quote what he said  He even seemed disappointed  When the referee  Finally got control  Why don't they just  Meet outside in the tunnel  After the ball game  And get it on some more  He urged  You don't come into  The Orange Bowl baby  We've had a down  Couple of years  But you don't come in here  Talking trash  The OB 
[01:04:00]  He called it the OB  That's the Orange Bowl  Yeah the Orange Bowl  The OB  What a DB he is  Everything sounds tough  When you call it that  S-N  Tom is on the phone  With him right now  With some choice words  You come in here  Talking smack  It's time to get it on  We let you play  In our stadium  They play well  I gotta give it to FIU  They played well so far  But you crossed the line  At some point  Thomas in an interview 
[01:04:30]  With the Miami Herald  An hour before he was fired  Said no one from CSS  Suggested he toned it down  During the telecast  And that he hadn't heard  From the network since  But he seemed to clearly  Expect some disciplinary action  I'm very new to this  Whole media thing  Said Thomas  I'm an ex-player  I love the school  I was doing games for  I'm very passionate  About the University of Miami  I love those kids  Just like my brothers  I played with my emotions  On my sleeve  And I broadcast games  Just like that  Unfortunately this thing 
[01:05:00]  Blew up into a national event  And I was caught  With my pants down  If I could do it all over again  I would be a little more  Tackful  His threat to join the fight  Thomas had  Was a joke  Everybody who knows  Anything about the Orange Bowl  Knows it's gonna take  At least 40 minutes  To go down the elevator  From the press box  He said  I'm 36 years old man  What am I gonna  What am I going to do  Down there  It was a joke  But people didn't  Take it that way  That's the way it goes  Slow chow  Fire  Oh Jimmy  Man  Fired 
[01:05:30]  Fired  Watch what you say  In this day and age  You really do  You just get thrown  Out the door  It's amazing  Kelly in New York  What's up  Hi I just wanted  To call you out  Opie out  Yeah  Because Jimmy was  Making fun of  Wearing black shoes  And white socks  And Opie was  Proudly showing off  His shoes  Onto the  Pal talk cameras  Wearing black shoes  And white socks  Well no

[01:17:30]  She called up  And she wanted to give a message to her hubby Dan  Crystal's pregnant  And wanted to give a message to Dan  Because he listens every morning  And tell Dan  Hey, turn around  You don't have to go to work today  And we kind of  Assumed  That perhaps Dan wasn't on his way to work  I don't know  Well, he left his cell phone home  Left his cell phone home  It just sounds a little fishy, you know 
[01:18:00]  So we speculated  As to what he might be doing  Aside from driving to work  And one of those things was  Perhaps he was going up for a little liaison  We're suggesting he might be in a bunny suit  A little call back there  Yeah  Well, we have Dan on the line  Dan, what's up?  Hey  Hey, Dan  My mistress heard my wife on the phone on your show  Yeah  She tripped and cracked her head on the nightstand 
[01:18:30]  I don't know what to do  I don't know what to do  Are you the Dan?  No  I just had to  Oh, thanks  Later  That would have been cool  If we got the actual  It would have actually been good  If it was Dan  Well, we won't be ignored, Dan  That's right  Let's go to Kate in Jersey  Kate, what's up?  Hey  Hey  I'm calling about the porn addiction  It's the real deal, man 
[01:19:00]  My ex was a full-on porn addict  And what was better  He was an attorney  So he'd be watching porn at work  And doing whatever he was doing  And then billing the clients for the hours  Wow  The clients would get billed for him  Doing what he's doing  Perusing pornography  Yeah, why would you say he was a porn addict?  Does six hours a day qualify?  Yep  How do you know it was six hours a day?  You got him on the clock?  Well, when he came clean to me about that 
[01:19:30]  And everything else he was doing  I found out about the details  What else was he doing?  Let's just say he and Jimmy would have had a lot to talk about  Oh, okay  He liked getting ladies?  Yes, he did like getting ladies  And with my money  And with your money  How do you not love this guy?  No offense  And let's just say  He liked ladies  That perhaps  Would drink a lot of water  Well, no 
[01:20:00]  Not for that extent  Alright, okay  I thought maybe when you said him  And Jimmy had something  Just ladies in general  Were the clients always wondering  Why their legal paperwork was laminated?  Oh, yeah  He left that job one step ahead of an investigation  Oh, wow  Alright  Well, thank you, Kate  Oh, you're so welcome  We can get a million of those calls  The weird thing is  CNN  Talked to someone named Lance  I don't think this guy has a problem 
[01:20:30]  Lance  I haven't heard the audio yet  But it says Lance  Never gonna get through this  That Lance looked at porn  Three to four times a day  I think the average adult male  Looks at porn  Three to four times a day  Yeah  Yeah, definitely  Easily, right?  If he has access to it  Yeah, absolutely  Definitely  See, that's Barry Pepper  Lance and Amy look like  Your average American family  Nice house  Beautiful son  Happy life  But getting to this point  Was a lot harder  Than you can ever imagine  I haven't looked at porn 
[01:21:00]  Or anything for three years now  Lance Tracy  Is a porn addict  And it almost destroyed his marriage  Well, when I was first married  You know, I was looking at porn  Gotta try harder  On a good day  Or a good week  Maybe once or twice a week  Bad week would be  Three, four times a day  For Lance  The deception began  It really is nothing  That's  That's  What is that?  That's like saying  I'm an alcoholic  I had a near beer on Tuesday  And then a Meisterbrow  On Friday afternoon  God almighty  What a rookie Lance is 
[01:21:30]  That's nothing  Three to four times a day?  When the internet  Especially when the internet  First really popped  With porno  There wasn't a guy  In this country  That wouldn't have been  Considered a porn addict  You spent  Hours  On end  Looking at pornography  That you couldn't get  In magazines  Or any of the places  You used to get it  And it was available now  At your fingertips  You were right there  You were of everyone  In the country 
[01:22:00]  Every man was a porn addict  That had a computer  You couldn't even  Get the magazines  I mean most guys  Couldn't just go out  And get a porn magazine  Because they were married  Or whatever  Yeah but this was easier  It was better  That's what I'm saying  It was more accessible  More material  You're saying  You know  That what you couldn't  Find in magazines  I'm saying  A lot of guys  Just couldn't even  Buy the magazines  Themselves  But now it's right there  On your computer  You take a quick peek  While the wife is in the kitchen  Cooking up supper  You don't have to change  Your schedule at all  To see it  Right 
[01:22:30]  And yeah  It's very addicting  But three to four times a day  This guy may last  That's not them  Creep  I'm talking about  I'm late for the cellar sometimes  Because I can't pick myself  Out of my computer chair  Literally my back hurts  I understand what addiction  I'm like  Alright well if I keep going  I'll just take a very fast shower  I can't stop  I can't  I'm out of control  Lance is a little girl  Really?  Hey look at it  Three times a day  Teehee  Oh a little peek  In her breast  Oh whoopsie daisy  And they've got that 
[01:23:00]  Running through the meadow  Acoustic music  Running behind them  Yeah yeah  Like oh this part  And then you know  When the music changes  Everything goes hard  Everything will be  And he says  Up to three to four times a day  Which means  Unless those  Unless those sessions  Lasted four hours a piece  You know who told him  He was a porn addict  That Dumbbelly's married  His wife  His stupid wife  Told him  That he was addicted to porn  He got busted  He got busted  And she's like  I'm gonna leave you  He goes  But I'm an addict 
[01:23:30]  I gotta  I need help  He's sitting there going  Oh jeez  I just looked at a few nude pictures  Enough  Give me a break  Times a day  For Lance  The deception began  Almost immediately  Deception  During their entire courtship  And for the first two years  Of their marriage  He kept his addiction  A secret from Amy  There's a lot of guilt  And shame  And so  You know  On my own part  Because I feel morally  It's not right  I hate Lance  See  It's this morality  That comes into it  Guilt  Shame 
[01:24:00]  There's no shame in it  Get on there  And then like  For the first two years  While I do the courtship  He kept it a secret  Well he kind of has to  What is he gonna say  Sorry I was late to pick you up  But I couldn't finish fast enough  I couldn't get that  Video downloaded quick enough  I just had to see what happened  When the horse walked into the frame  Sorry sweetie  What kind of vernacular is that  Courtship  Like he comes to court  Exactly  Yeah  Come to court  I go right back to the  Three to four times a day though  That's nothing 
[01:24:30]  He was gonna serenade her  Outside her window  Unless she let her hair down  Ridiculous  Lance was so ashamed  That he privately sought help  Through a support group  Turns out  His addiction  Isn't uncommon  There are men that I work with  Who will spend  Four to six hours a day online  It's easier than ever  To access porn  And as a result  Porn addiction  Is on the rise  Rob Weiss  The director of the  Sexual Recovery Institute  Has seen it time and time again  They'll get up 
[01:25:00]  In the middle of the night  When they're sure  Their wife's asleep  And they'll go online  To look at pornography  For Lance  His wife eventually found out  And his secret addiction  Became the focal point  Of their marriage  I was really  Really hurt  I mean  I was  Shocked and hurt  And felt betrayed  And probably angry  He immediately got professional counseling  But his addiction  Caused a deep rift  In their relationship  I felt like  I wasn't attractive to him  Because  These stupid women 
[01:25:30]  Don't get it  They don't get it  You have to be a slut  Every once in a while  Yeah you goody gumdrops  Stop being a goody gumdrops  Stop making eye contact  You have to be a slut  Every once in a while  Can I just point out  That's the secret  To James Norton  That you hit that  Right on the head  She caught him  And he all of a sudden  Ended up in counseling  Because she was upset  About the whole thing  He does love the old nag  He doesn't want to  End the relationship 
[01:26:00]  But I hate to tell you  Cookie  In the sack  You're a dud  You know what you are  You're vanilla ice cream  You're melted vanilla ice cream  And he wanted to  Bury his face  In some Twix ice cream  And maybe have a little  Twix bar on his chest  Some peanut butter  It's simple  You gotta be a slut  Every once in a while  It comes down to that  Yeah  Comes down to that  The reality is  We all want to  F like animals  From time to time  She's a goody two shoes  I don't want to do that  It hurts  Oh don't pull my hair  It'll be all must up 
[01:26:30]  I have to take the kids to work  And there's nothing wrong  With perusing pornography  Pornography on the net  What the hell's wrong with it  He was probably on  Some filthy sites too  I don't think so  He was on filthy sites  It doesn't sound like he was  It sounds like he was  Looking at some nudie pictures  It sounds like he was  Just doing some basic porn  This doesn't sound like  Somebody whose job  Is being jeopardized  By going online  This is his wife  Was hurt  Like he was cheating  With the computer  Or he got caught 
[01:27:00]  In a dirty instant message  That she found  Or something  And he had to tie it in  With his addiction  I don't think  That he was doing  It doesn't sound that bad  That's just it  When they had sex  And she was lying back  He would prop the laptop  Up on her chest  By her face  And just type  And look up better faces  And hotter things  Hotterfaces.com  And her chest was all sore  Because the laptop is hot  And burning her chest  How great would that be  He's put it right on her dumb face  Don't tell your head stupid 
[01:27:30]  I'm watching something  I just want to feel loved  Shut up  Let's go to Bill in Jersey  Bill says it all here  Bill go ahead  Hi man what's up  I just heard about that  You know that she's complaining  That you know guys are getting up  And looking at porn  Just like you guys said  If they were getting it at home  They wouldn't have to look it up  You  If you're getting it enough  You don't look at porn as much  Yeah  If your wife is some crazy  You know  Some crazy freak  And you know what  Like  Then they're not going to have to  And I'm generalizing  I'm sure there's people out there 
[01:28:00]  With legitimate problems  Where they just can't get enough  But in general  A guy will not look at porn as much  Or look at the hot pieces of asses  Walking down the sidewalk  If they're getting enough at home  Or how about this stupid wives  Why don't you watch it with him  Or do something for him  While he's watching it  Why don't you throw a curve ball  Once in a while  Instead of being the  Kvetching nag  That you always are  And turn that off  That's terrible  Go over there  When you catch him  Go what are you looking at  You filthy guy  What are you looking at 
[01:28:30]  Oh you like dirty stuff like that  Do you  And then just like  Smack him or something  That's right  Stop being a mommy  And be a slut everyone  She got her big  Bunt mom jeans on  When she came into that room  And went  Oh my god  Oh Lance  Wearing sensible sneakers  She looks up at the wedding picture  Of both of them  With their arms around each other  And then looks at the screen  And there's just disgusting donkey  And a Spanish woman  Dirtycowgirls.com 
[01:29:00]  How could you  Oh Lance  You took a vow  Shut up  You know what an awful lay she must be  An awful lay  She only wants it one way  Where she has to put her hands  On his shoulders  And look in his eyes  And he has to try to focus  With his eyes wide open  Pretending she's anyone  But the stupid mullet wife  That she is  His eyes are open so wide  He's trying to fantasize  His contacts fall in her mouth  Gotta throw a little lust  In the relationship  Not all about love ladies 
[01:29:30]  Pull his sweatpants down  The next time you catch him  Marching porn  Stop being such a buzzkill  Spank his hiney  Yeah  Tell him he's bad  And pull his pants down  You're naughty boy  For watching that  Aren't you  And make him  Put on a pair of your pants  Oh sorry  You wanna do that  You know what  Don't be dirty for real  And don't try that  Fun wife naughtiness  Yeah yeah  That you and your dumb  Girlfriends talk about  Like you know  Oh maybe I'll give him  A swat on the fanny  That's not sexy  To a porn addict  A swat on the fanny  Turns no one on 
[01:30:00]  Swat on the fanny  You know like one of those  Oh you're naughty  And then they giggle after  And spoil the illusion  Oh stop laughing  You whore  I've been bad  I'd love to hear  The counseling session too  Yeah I admit it  I like pictures of girls  Yeah  Yeah  Oh Lance  Alright let's continue here  The audio's great  I live to him  Because he wasn't  Initiating the same way  And I think he was  Getting a lot of his  Needs met  Over the internet 
[01:30:30]  Yes  And so I started  Wondering what's wrong  With me  Well what's wrong  With you is  You didn't get the hint  The 20 million times  When he said  Hello look  When he said  Things like  Excuse me  That's not corn  On the cob  You're eating  He used to lighten up  They just looked  The other way  And he gave her  All the signs  Right there  And it was probably  Normal you know  Stuff that he wanted  I'm a busy mother  Do you have a picture 
[01:31:00]  Of her  That would be good  Can you do a picture  Of her  Well here we go  Let's see what she looks like  Here we go  Listen to this clip  Even as Lance  Struggled to regain  Control of his life  As with any addiction  There were times  He fell off the wagon  Or slipped  While I was trying to get better  And going to these different  Little programs and what not  I was still looking at it  Off and on  That was  You know  A good sign  That I was definitely addicted  It was a failure to stop  Even though I was trying to stop  We have a saying that  Internet pornography  Is the crack cocaine  Of sex addiction  And what we've been able 
[01:31:30]  To tell in the last few years  Is that  What  On MRIs  When you see a sex addict's  Brain light up  Around sexual stimulation  It looks like a cocaine addict  That's actually the truth  But the crack addiction  Is awful  Because you don't  Pipe people over the head  To get money  To join a website  You don't shoot cops  Over porn addictions  On websites  It's kind of a dumb thing  Well good news guys  The story ends nicely here  Ah the music  Let me guess how it ends nicely  Let me guess how it ends nicely  Okay  He finally begins to conquer 
[01:32:00]  His porn addiction  And then she jumps for joy  And paralyzes herself  And now he watches it  With her in the bed  Next to him  And there's nothing she can do  But blow in her tube  She blows in the tube  And all the lights up  On her screen  She was just about to jump  And yell whoopee  And her stupid mom foot  Hit the top step  And she tumbled down clumsily  Like a sack of potatoes  Now she tries to yell at him 
[01:32:30]  Through a straw  Oh parrot lungs  What's that you're trying to say dear  He's just got his hands full  It wasn't easy  No  But with determination  Spirituality  And the love of his wife  Lance is getting better  You go Lance  I've been sober for three years  Sober  Wait wait wait wait 
[01:33:00]  Did he say sober  Yeah  Could you stop using the same words  Exactly  Say it  I've been boring for three years  Yeah  I've been horny for three years  Why do they use that  It really takes away from  Alcoholism  Drug addiction  When people say this  When's the last time  You used it like this  Beat your wife and kids  And didn't remember it  Due to a porn addiction  It's the same addiction 
[01:33:30]  It really is  But I mean  Don't over dramatize it  I'm almost to the date  And now  To celebrate  All that they've gone through  Lance and Amy  Have decided to renew their vows  On their fifth wedding anniversary  Fifth wedding  He's whipped already  We just need to start over  And put the past behind us  Behind us  Instead of trading in new partners  We just moved away from the past  And renewed our vows  Oh it's over Johnny  She's fire  We've made it through  And you know  And we are better for it now 
[01:34:00]  Yeah you really sound convincing  Very convincing Lance  Yeah  I was going to take her  To Patrice's swinger club  Yeah  Take her to La Trapeze  Ew  Did Patrice go to a swingers club  Oh yeah  La Trapeze  Yeah  Patrice had some  Stellar stories yesterday  What did he do  With the swingers club  Besides make every other couple  Uncomfortable  When he wandered in the room  With a hot chick  And they're like  What is he  Can he just leave  We'll take her  Can he stand guard at the door  Like one of those  Bouncers in a strip club  When you get in a lap dance 
[01:34:30]  We got everyone  That wants to pipe in  On this porn addiction thing  We got a counselor  Luanna  Hey  How are y'all today  Hi Luanna  Let's go  Well I just wanted to say  You realize  He's not just looking  At the porn  Three and four times a day  Yeah  You know that right  Right  Yeah he's taking care  Of business  Exactly  Yeah  So then he has  Nothing for his wife  So that does put  A strain on the relationship  He has nothing  For his wife  Because she hasn't  Given him anything  Luanna 
[01:35:00]  She sounds like a dud  Yeah she sounds  Like a dud  I'm not really with you guys  She sounds like  She just lays on her back  And can't wait for it  To be over  So she can check on the kids  And go back to being a mom  And the whole  She likes being a mommy  The whole thing about him being  Or her being you know  Horrified when she saw it  Oh my god  Yeah like why didn't she  Jump in and help out  And have a good time with it  Well not a lot of women  Have that freedom to do that  What  It's been sexually repressed  For a long time  Yeah but that's  I'm sick of  I understand that  But there's no victims 
[01:35:30]  Only volunteers  You can't keep saying things like  As a woman I expect to be  Treated equally  I expect this  I expect that  I demand this  I demand that  And you're right to demand  That stuff  But then when it comes to  The sexual views  You still play the victim  Well we're taught  We're not supposed to do that  Well you're also at one point  You're not supposed to make  As much as a man  Or you're not as smart as a man  Or you're not as dominating  In the workplace as a man  And yet you override those things  So what about the sexual stuff  You're right  I don't disagree with you  Jimmy  You're 100% correct  But it's still  It's an addiction 
[01:36:00]  It's very serious  It's very scary  Yeah it is  It does ruin lives  But this guy didn't sound addicted  This guy sounded whipped  This guy  And let me tell you something also  If this happened after five years  Like this is just five years  They're renewing their vows  Then it probably started  Pretty early in their marriage  So if they got to do that  And then you know  She talked him into the renewing  The vows  To make everything all better  It's over John  I also blame him  Because he probably wanted more 
[01:36:30]  From a wife and a relationship  And just kind of looked past all that  He probably realized early on  That she was a dud in bed  Like oh boy  This ain't gonna be good  Right  He was probably doing that  Long before they got married  And a lot of times  Yeah  Sex addicts will get married  Thinking  Well this is gonna stop it  This is gonna help  Right right  But she should  You know that  Right right  No I'm sorry  Go ahead  It's gonna make them  You know  If I have a wife  I'll straighten up  I won't do it anymore  But as a guy  Look  I mean I love porn  I think I'm probably addicted to it  To the concept of it 
[01:37:00]  To all of it  And I've behaved like an addict with it  So I understand that  And a lot of times  A woman will do what you want  And you'll still choose the porn  Which is where it becomes  Really unhealthy and destructive  But just listening to her  And the way she reacted  You know  You could just tell  That she's like one of these hens  Who is probably just horrid  And lightly experimental  And boring in the sack  And this guy  Through addiction  Wants more  You know  You understand what I mean  It's like  It's like a woman  Who comes from a really rich family  Dating a broke guy  She's going to be miserable  And feel like it's lacking  That's the way it is 
[01:37:30]  When a sex addict  Marries a goody gumdrops  You're just missing  I agree  So women  Get with the porn  A little bit  Time to maybe  Have her take a little gander  At the pillow  During some of their sex play  You know what  Maybe she needs to be taught  That blood and tears  Can at times  Be beneficial  And the smell  Will come out of the sheets  All right Lou Anna  Exactly  Thank you  Take care y'all  We could easily keep going  But we have to take a break  We'll try to get to some  Of these phone calls  After the break 
[01:38:00]  Brian Cox  To join the program next  Laszlo in here  He's got the new game  From Rockstar Bully  Somebody's playing it  On the big  Bully  Panasonic Plasma TV  It looks great on the TV  Got gaming on this  Panasonic looks great  Doesn't it  Yeah  They're just fooling around  With the game  In the background  Bully  It looks like it's going to be  Another winner for Rockstar  Jim Norton is a cop  In the game  Yes  Yeah we got some of  Jim Norton's lines  We're going to try to get to  Before we end this part  Of the Opie and Anthony show today  It's the ONA virus  Spreading across America  Opie and Anthony's appearance

[01:39:30]  He has a porn addiction  Ty  A girl from Maine  Why does wife think  Guys have to initiate sex  Married 18 years  Wives just want to be  Good girls now  That's Mike and Rocklin  Ow  I'm telling you man  We want you to be a slut  Every once in a while  Well maybe she tried  To initiate sex  And like a lot of women  Are terrible at it  Like there are girls  That will just get naked  And lay there  And go come on  And it's like  Do you understand  How awful that is 
[01:40:00]  And how  Just like you need  To be seduced  I need to be seduced  To a certain degree  Like women don't understand  That it's like  You know you have  All these conditions  Which fair enough  A lot of guys are pigs  They just want to kiss you once  And then hop on  And be alright  Understandable  That's annoying  But just like you need things  We need things  Don't just get naked  And I resent that  And I'll never give you  What you want  You actually resent that  And you'll never get  What you want  Ever  It'll be like a mouse tail  Hanging there  Good luck ladies 
[01:40:30]  If you're not going to  Put any effort into  Turning me on  You're going to get nothing  Don't just lay there  Naked and take for granted  Because you're a woman  And you're naked  Like oh here's the gift  Jim  Not happening  Like Nicholson  In carnal knowledge  Where it just ends up  At the end  Where he just needs  So much twistedness  To even have it work anymore  Well dude  It's like she can be  Replaced now  It's like you understand  As much as men  Are replaced by donors  And you really don't need us  Thanks to the old test tube  Or whatever  We don't need you  Thanks to the computer

[01:43:00]  That was the real Kenny  That came out for a second  What'd he say  No one else moved around  That was defensive slash aggressive hateful Kenny  That's gotta work  Yeah it has to work  Better  Third time's a charm  Now you can hear the callers and everything  Just for phone calls  We were talking about sex addiction  And you know  Could you mind  Who's who  Opie  Anthony  Jim Norton  Jim Norton  You blew off Jim Norton  One time in your past  Hurt my feelings 
[01:43:30]  Did you  Yeah  He wasn't mean  He just hurt my feelings  What happened  I'm very sensitive  Well I know that but  Well I know Jim Norton  Funnily enough  Was it a misunderstanding  Cause there's an old friend of mine  Who's called Jim Norton  He's an actor  Is he  An Irish actor  Oh no no  I'm not  I can say I act  But I won't call myself an actor  He's an actor  N-O-R-T-O-N  Yeah yeah  Well that's Jim Norton  How old is he though  Is he like an old time actor  Yeah he's about 60  Okay  I'm sure his credits are a lot better than mine  I get like  I'm like a 5 and under guy  He was in The Weir 
[01:44:00]  On Broadway  And he did Dublin Carol  On Broadway  I'm not really good at  He was in Lucky Louie  On HBO  He was on a show  That got canned  And I had one line in Spider-Man  And I've been in  Probably five of the worst  Independent films ever done  How did I  I went to the premiere  Of Match Point  Which was an amazing film  And you were great in it  And I wanted to get photos  With everybody  Because that's just what I do  That's what Jimmy does  And the highlight  I've got to be honest  I'm a comedian  So Woody Allen for me  My manager  We're the same manager  Introduced me to Woody  And I mean that was  You know  And Sun Yee  All fairness  Oddhead 
[01:44:30]  Not good in person  Yeah  And yeah  Strange looking girl  And I got a picture with Woody  And Scarlett Johansson  That's where I got my Scarlett Johansson  Very beautiful girl  And I asked Brian  He said no  Oh I'm sorry  That's what you're going to get  I'm sorry  I do make a policy of it  Sometimes  You know it's funny  Sometimes my Native American  Blood creeps in  And I think you're going to  Capture my soul  And I say no fault  Yeah  See that's what happens  When they snap your picture  Yeah but I've been doing it recently  I've been doing a play recently  And it's been happening 
[01:45:00]  On a regular basis  So if you were standing outside  The Duke of York's Theatre  In St. Martin's Lane  In the last four months  You would have had your picture  Taken with me  And I really apologize  That's right  I was just hurt  People must ask you a lot though now  Especially with the X-Men stuff  I mean you get a lot  That's a whole different breed of fan  It's always difficult  When you get somebody  Who comes up with you  With no teeth  And cross eyes  And hair  Not arms  You look like this  But you know  And they want to have  Your photograph taken with you  You go  It just feels a little weird  And weird sometimes  Weird  Yeah  Well the X-Men crowd  Also anytime you make 
[01:45:30]  A comic book movie  You're going to get  A certain fan base  That's probably different  Than other movies you've made  Yeah  To be polite  You know geeks  Yeah  But that's okay  I don't mind  Most fans are geeks anyway  And nice geeks  There's nothing wrong with geeks  I'm told you're geeks  But I don't know  Yeah  We have tendency  Some of us have tendency  To be a little more geeks  You know  Be into the old technology thing  Laszlo here  He's a geek  Hello sir  But there's nothing wrong  With being a geek  Correct  Unless you're addicted to porn 
[01:46:00]  No no no  Geeks are what make the world go wrong  You're like a real trained  Like he's intimidating  Because like  As an actor  He's like a real actor  Like he's not a guy  Who just like is a comedian  That kind of gig  This guy's like a  Stage actor  Like a guy that could  You know stand on stage  With Hopkins  And make it work  Or anybody in the business  And I have an audition today  And I'm just trying to figure out  How do I tilt my head  When I horribly deliver this line  Now look  You have a professional here  Maybe you can get  A little guidance  What do you  This is my biggest problem  When I act  Besides the whole like  Lack of ability thing 
[01:46:30]  What do you do  With your hands  I ask every actor  We interview this  I never know what to do  With my hands  I always feel like  Like when I have  If I'm sitting down  I can just kind of  Put them up  Fold my arms  Hold my legs  But when I'm standing  I just feel like a stiff idiot  And I either put them  On my hips  Like a superhero  Or I just hang them  Like I'm kind of dead  You know  It's not  You just realize  He has his work  Cut out for him  Where do I begin  Brian  He's serious  Help him out  No no no  I think that 
[01:47:00]  It is hard to know  What to do with your hands  You know  I mean I even have times  When I find it really difficult  To know what to do with my hands  And sometimes I put my hands  In my pockets  Or you know  Sometimes I  You know  I sit on them  Or what have you  Do you get a lot of direction  About what to do with your hands  No no no  No  The director assumes  You know what to do  With your hands  At this point  If you've gotten to this point  They wouldn't direct him that way  Me they'd go  Hey stupid  The hand's no good  Stop waving at them  Like there's flies around you  I think the thing to do  Is to just  You know  One of 
[01:47:30]  A thing that's quite good  Is to  To put your thumb  And your index fingers together  Before you do a take  And then just release it  Oh  So if you do that  If you hold that  And then you're doing a take  And if you have that problem  You just release it  And then you forget about it  My problem is  I'll forget to release it  And everything I say  Will look like I'm giving the A-OK sign  Or smoking a roach  Exactly  Yeah  I ask this to other guys  We interview too  Like what  Is there anybody  Because you've been in the business  For a while  I mean it's I think 
[01:48:00]  The 65 the while goes back to  So you've been  You've had a long history of work  Yeah a long history  Is there anybody  You've done stage with  Or a film with  Where you just could not believe  You were in a scene  With this person  Like I can't believe  That I'm actually acting  With this guy  Or this woman  Yeah there's been  A few people like that  Who you know  You know Annette Bening  I mean who's a fantastic actress  You know  And she's  She really puts you  On your game  You know the great thing  Is when you work  With a really good actor  You make  You know because acting  Is you know  As Clint Eastwood said  It's all about reacting 
[01:48:30]  It's all about acting  So in a sense  If you work with a great actor  I thought he was in the room  Pardon?  I thought he was in the room  Oh you thought he was in the room  Yeah  But it's true  You know  I  You know Annette  Annette Bening's one  Morgan Freeman  There's another  You know  What's his name  The other guy  The other one  Sam  Sam  Sam  Sam  Sam Jackson  Sam Jackson  You know Sam  You know  I've been very lucky  Working with a lot  Ed Norton 
[01:49:00]  You know there's a lot of  Guys you work with  Who are  Another friend of Jimmy's  Exactly  Upsets me  He must be a relation of yours  No I actually met him  At the Comedy Cellar  It's the first thing he said  He goes hey my brother's name is Jim  And I just said something like  You know stupid ass I am  I just nothing to say to the stars  Yeah he's really good  By the way Brian a lot of people don't know  Do you get sick and tired of people asking about being  Like you were the first like Hannibal Lecter  I mean that was you before  Before  You hate hearing about it or 
[01:49:30]  No it's very  You know I don't know  No the thing about being the first  It's just one of those things  It just goes on and on and on  I mean I now  You know I now fess up  I am  Was the first Hannibal Lecter  And I'm very grateful  It's been  Opened a lot of doors for me  And whenever  Any film 
[01:50:00]  Relating to that subject  Opens  I always get good reviews  Which is nice  When I haven't done any of the work  So I  I'm  I'm very grateful to Hannibal Lecter  Were you annoyed  When they gave it to Hopkins  For the other one  Or you didn't care  What happened to do with it  I was  I didn't even  You know originally  There was a problem over the name  I don't know if you realize  But  If you look at Hannibal Lecter  In  Manhunter  And you look at Hannibal Lecter  He's spelt differently  He's actually called  I think he's L-E-K-T-O-R 
[01:50:30]  Whereas in  The other movies  He's L-E-C-K  T-O-R  And  There was a problem over the name  And they thought  They couldn't use the name  So for a while  He was called  I think he was called Quigley  In one of the  Earlier drafts  Of  Silence of the Langs  I may have got this wrong  Because  We had the same agent  And I remember my agent  Saying to me  Oh  You know  Tony's going up for this role  Which sounds very like  The part you played  He's called Quigley  But it's written by Tom Harris 
[01:51:00]  In The Silence of the Lambs  And I said  Oh that's good  And then I realized  It was the same role  But  No  I've  You know  I was doing something else  At the time  The irony  Actually  This is much quoted  But the irony is  I was playing King Lear  At the National Theatre  When  Tony was playing Hannibal Lecter  And when he was playing King Lear  At the National Theatre  I was playing Hannibal Lecter  So it's kind of weird  He just referred to Hopkins twice  As Tony  Like that's  Really good  Don't you want to be there 
[01:51:30]  Jimmy  Yeah  Don't you want to be there  I still call him Anthony  Somebody was singing your praises  And saying  You know  Was it the gentleman  With the green arms  Who met me at the door  Oh  Creepy Steve  We call him  Yeah  He said  That you did a video game together  And that you were  A wonderful actor  He said  He's a really good actor  I'm not an actor at all  Apparently he was in it as well  That was very nice  Of you to relay  But here's what stupid Steve just did  And let me catch that bastard  He just wanted you to know 
[01:52:00]  That he did something  And he couldn't be so obnoxious  To go  Do you know I did a video game  Would you please tell me  What you think  I did voiceover  To make it look like  He was giving me a compliment  Well he was giving you a compliment  It certainly is  With your creepy green arms  Brian doesn't like it  And neither do we  I didn't say that  Well you didn't have to  Oh the first thing he said  This morning when I gave him the game  Was I've got to go to IMDB  And make sure that it's there already  Yeah he wants his credit  On IMDB  Look if I'm going to get  Is this on  If I'm going to get pummeled  You know mercilessly  I'm going to make sure  It's up on IMDB  Yeah go to Brian's IMDB site 
[01:52:30]  And then look at a real actor's site  Before you look at  Your one credit for a voiceover  On a video game  Believe me  I'm not deluding myself at all  Yes you are  I'm not  Don't sell yourself short  Do we have  There's a couple of  Steve did a sketch  We have audio of  Do we have a couple  Just lines  We have like little lines  From Steve  And if you want to see  Somebody emote  I mean this kid is good  Well yeah give the set up too  For Brian  It was a sketch where Steve  Steve you want to explain  The sketch to Mr. Scott  No not really  It was  It was one of our interns 
[01:53:00]  Bill played a weird guy  Who walks into Steve's house  And it's a bizarre sketch  And Steve just has such emotion  And it turns out that in the sketch  Bill's parents have died  So Steve has to ask Bill  How did your parents die  There's just a lot of emotion in it  And then there's another part  Where he says why not  Now listen to the emotion  The difference  The dynamic  Between how did your parents die  And just an ordinary why not  Grabbed randomly from his lines  Here's why not 
[01:53:30]  Why not  How'd your parents die  Why not  How'd your parents die  Why not  How'd your parents die  Do you detect the emotion  In the parents dying part  Well maybe that's  Is it good as an actor  To just kind of like say  Everything the same  And figure that the audience  Can put in the pauses  Where they feel it's necessary  Or the emotion  Yeah  Or the dynamic  Or anything  Steve is like mad libs  With emotion  Like he'll throw out the lines  And then let the audience  Fill in however they feel about it  Um 
[01:54:00]  Well it's a very difficult thing  To  I can't really tell  From just hearing those two lines  Oh yes you can  Because that's it  That's his range  Well it seems  That's all you get  It sounded real  And that's  That's  That's  You know  Sometimes that's the best  The views are in  You know  I mean the thing about  Brian Cox  It sounded real  He'll put it on his bio  He'll put it on his bio  As a credit  He quotes around  I hear it again  Yeah  Here he goes  Why not 
[01:54:30]  How'd your parents die  Why not  How'd your parents die  Well there's a genuine intention there  You could hear the intention was  That he really wanted to know  How their parents died  So in fact  He succeeded quite well  I don't think that's bad at all  And also he didn't let emotion  Get in the way  Right  What I want to know is  What does the why not relate to  I don't get  The why not  Doesn't really relate to  What was why not again  I don't remember  Was it that Bill wanted to come in  And he said  Can I come in 
[01:55:00]  And you said why not  Yeah  Oh no it was  I can't go home  And he couldn't come back  Oh he can't go home  And then he said why not  And he goes my parents died  And then Steve  We have a response  Steve goes  How'd your parents die  But when Bill says  My parents died  Steve has a response to that  Yes  Which is just  Which is just thick  With compassion and emotion  Yes  It's beautiful  Some more Steve  That's terrible  I'm sorry  He has a little stutter  A stammer thing  That's terrible  I'm sorry  Yeah you're embarrassed 
[01:55:30]  Which is fine  I can see that  And that's a kind of  Genuine emotion  Some see something  These  This gentleman's parents  Have died  And you're embarrassed  That they've died  And you're saying  Hear it again  Yes of course  That's terrible  I'm sorry  So you're saying  That's terrible  I'm sorry  That's terrible  I'm sorry  That's terrible  I'm sorry  That's terrible  I'm sorry  And it's like  I want to get out of the room  Because it's terrible 
[01:56:00]  And I'm sorry  So I actually think  You do it quite well  I'm actually rather impressed  Wow  Thank you sir  Brian just took horse manure  And made lemonade  But you know  Half the thing  With all of this  I mean I've just done this movie  Go running with scissors  Yeah  And the thing is  The material is so extraordinary  You don't have to do anything  You just sit back on it  And let it ride you  Rather than try and ride it  Because there's no way  You could ever match it  I'm looking forward to the movie 
[01:56:30]  I've read the book  Yeah  It's a good movie  It's a crazy story  Are you playing the psychiatrist?  I play Finch  Yeah  I play the doctor  The doctor  Yeah  And the psychiatrist  He adopts  I adopt Augustine Burroughs  Right right  And it's a really good story  I mean people have been going on  About the veracity of it  The truth  Sorry  I don't want to use big words  That's okay  Steve's still in the room  Sorry Steve  My apologies  I'm sorry  I don't understand that  That's okay  I'm sorry  Terrible  No but you know 
[01:57:00]  The great thing is that  You know  It's actually  It's a very extreme story  But actually  The real story  Is probably much more extreme  And that's what people  You know  The old thing  Life is always much stranger  Yeah  What's the story about  For the people  That maybe didn't read the book  Well the story is about  A young man  In the 70s  Which says it all  Because that was the crazy time  So it was about a young man  In the 70s  Whose mother is going through  A kind of crisis  Which is a crisis of self esteem  And she wants to be famous 
[01:57:30]  Basically because  Andy Warhol said  Everybody should have  50 minutes of fame  So she thinks  Well why not me  And she has these  She writes this poetry  Which is not very good  And she has these poetry readings  Which nobody comes to  And finally she's going through  This break up in the marriage  And her husband's an alcoholic  And the boy is there  And she's going through a crisis  And basically the boy  Is left abandoned  And so this doctor  Who's her psychiatrist  Adopts him  But then his family  Is wacky 
[01:58:00]  And it's a really interesting  Kind of dimension  Because of just  You know  It's like  It's like one of those  It's like Harold and Maude  One of those  Hal Ashby stories  You know  Of the 70s  It's  It doesn't sound like  Something you hear all the time  Oh that movie again  You know  It doesn't sound like  One of those  But it's actually a period  That you know  I lived through  And we wore the most  You know  Nowadays we wore clothes like that  We'd be locked up  You know  They're awful  Yeah 
[01:58:30]  It was the sartorial worst period ever  You know  It was just a disaster  And what about Wolverine  Yeah well  I spoke to the writer yesterday  David Benhoff  And who knows  They CGI'd  In the last movie  X-Men 3  They CGI'd  Both Ian McKellen  And Patrick Stewart  To make them look  20 years old  I say to make them look  30 years young  That was really amazing  It was  In fact they looked  Too young 
[01:59:00]  Yeah  I thought no no  They've gone too far  You know  I mean  I mean Ian  Apart from the fact  That he sounded like  Some olden bookie  He looked as if  He was just out of school  You know  Yeah  So the voice in the face  Didn't quite match up  But it was amazing  And so if they can do  The same for me  Then I'm prepared  To do the movie  Yeah obviously  It's a prequel  If they ask me  Yeah it's a prequel  And as people  Everybody knows  Wolverine doesn't age  You know  He's still Hugh Jackman 
[01:59:30]  And he'll always be  Hugh Jackman  You know  Yeah  Unfortunately Hugh Jackman's  Aging  So they better hurry up  Because I have to  Then CGI him  You know  This movie with you  This is a really good cast  I'm looking at  As you're going over  With the films about  I mean yourself obviously  Annette Bening  Jill Kleberg  Who's been around  For a long time  He's fantastic  Alec Baldwin  I mean  He's also fantastic  Great great  It's  I think the great thing  About the movie  Excuse me  The great thing about the movie  Is the fact that  Everybody in it  Is at the top of their game 
[02:00:00]  You know  If you want  Steve  Oh he's gone  If you want  Real good acting lessons  You should go and see the movie  Because  They really are  I mean Alec Baldwin  He plays a small part  But he's so wonderful  As this alcoholic  Joe Fine  I mean the surprise  Of the movie for me  Is Joe Fiennes  Joe Fine  Who always played  These guys in flouncy shirts  And tights down  I don't know who he is  Is he related  He's not related to Ralph  Is he  He's Ray Fiennes' brother  Oh Ray  I'm sorry  Ralph  That's right  Ralph  Ray  Ralph  I pardon  I pardon you  God I'm lying 
[02:00:30]  How did I forget that  He was in Shakespeare  I pardon you  Yeah  No he's  He's wonderful  He was in Shakespeare in Love  And  A couple of other movies  Well we've got to take a break  So  Brian this was definitely  A thrill for us  Absolutely  Giving Steve acting lessons  Yeah  Anytime  And the film is called  Running with Scissors  It opens in New York  And Los Angeles  On Friday  October 20th  Which is this coming Friday  A few nights from tonight  And nationwide  It's on the 27th

[02:07:00]  Actually is named Jimmy  But he's being bullied  Yeah  Yes  He's being bullied  There's nerds  And jocks  And it's basically  Sort of a comedy  And a coming of age teen  Well we got some of Jimmy's lines  Oh yes  We have some of Steve's too  Please God  Yeah we're going to end with that  Are you kidding me  We're going to compare  The quality of acting  I looked for flubs  On Jim  And I didn't find any  Awesome  Here's Jimmy and Bully  Playing the officer  Don't mess with the law  That just sounds like me 
[02:07:30]  That'll be in the game  That's hysterical  That is good  Oh my best bra is ruined  I could so picture this  Me too  Because you put it on  I am on duty  Don't bother me  I suck  No I like that  Because I could totally picture  Walking up to your character  In the game  And having it say this  Yeah I got my eyes closed  I think you did a great job  Better not be anyone 
[02:08:00]  Hiding from me around here  Get back here kid  Yeah you can actually  Hide in trash cans  In the game  Lockers  Lockers  I know  One of my favorite  Parts of any game  Is when you're walking around  And there's somebody  That is supposed to not see you  And they blurt out  Something like  Hey what was that  And then you just  Like stop for two seconds  And they go  Huh must have been the wind  And then they walk away  And then hey what was that  Must have been the wind  This is the worst guard ever  I'm right here you dummy 
[02:08:30]  Yeah  Do you know what I've done  To kids in the past  Oh well  Is that an outtake  Or just off of Jimmy's computer  Yes  He caught my brain  He picked up a little  Electrode in the head  I don't know how that  Just snuck out to me  Ah Jimmy  That's not the line  Yes  Oh oh  I gotta go  Don't want to miss  The lingerie sale  That was actually  At the end of the  Recording session  We were just trying to chat  I hate my acting  No it's good voice work 
[02:09:00]  Trust me  We'll play a guy  You'll feel really good  About yourself  You gotta see it all together  With your  And the graphics guy  Works your hands  Are we trying to  So it doesn't matter  See and this is  Your character  That's your character  I look like the garden  Clockwork orange  I love it  Oh you do  Big mustache  6705-321  You're a big guy  You got a nice chin  Thank you  Your character has a nice chin  Jimmy  I like it  With a little dimple in the middle  Well they gave you a really huge chin 
[02:09:30]  They really do  Like Dudley Do-Right  Well are these pictures up on  OpieandAnthony.com  They should be  I can get them to you  Yeah they definitely should be  So people can see the character  Jimmy plays in Bully  And if Rockstar had any common sense  They would work with me  On a character based on me  There's a lot to do  There certainly is  Here's Jimmy's last line for today  Why do you punks  Always have to cross the line  Wow  That scared myself  That scared me  Jimmy Norton everyone  Oh I feel  And Rockstar Game Bully 
[02:10:00]  So Steve plays a construction worker  Yeah  Who hangs out in the bad part of town  Ironically  He was the one of the village people  He liked the most  Because the motorcycle guy  His mustache was too big  He'd get bacon bits caught in it  And we pissed  He'd get  All right  So his character is hard working  Easy going  Goes to community college at night  Optimistic  Likes pretty women  And dates many of them  Always having romantic misadventures  But has a sense of humor about it  Friendly  Enjoys his life  All right 
[02:10:30]  And your character  You can actually  As Jimmy  You can walk up  As Jimmy the character in the game  You can walk up to  The construction worker  And have a conversation with Steve  And this is Steve's lines  From Bully  The problem is  Is that people don't listen  To my ideas  I'm really clever you know  I don't know  In fact you said  Is twice in a row  And that was just taken  From his production studio  The problem is  Is  The problem is  Come is  Yeah  It should be  The problem is  Can you play that again  Because he says 
[02:11:00]  The problem is  Is  Let me hear that  You're stupid stupid  The problem is  Is that people  Don't listen to my ideas  I'm really clever you know  No  No  That's  That's another one  That's terrible  I'm sorry  The problem is  Is  Hey man  That's his style  It's his trademark  Yeah  My style  You have a trademark  Like style of acting  It's  It's  The problem is  Is  The problem is  No  No  Stay in the  And I guarantee  His hands were upturned  And like Steve  His palms were up to the sky 
[02:11:30]  The problem is  Just moving back and forth  Picture if you're holding  Two  Grapefruits  Yeah  You're holding two  Grapefruits in your hands  Out in front of you  Arms stretched  And your palms  Are underneath  The grapefruits  That's  His hands  Yeah  And he's just moving them  Back and forth  What do you got Laszlo?  Hit track 10  Track 10?  Yeah  This should be on your replay machines  Great  Alright  Track 10  This is Steve  And the rock star game 
[02:12:00]  Bully  That's probably true  But I don't really care  Yes  And then  We could use that  For a lot of stuff  Right  And here's  Here's the passionate one  That reminded me of  Steve's past  In a rock band  Track 11  Track 11  Yeah  I just imagined him doing this  At the front of the stage  When he was wearing  That girl's kilt  Or whatever he was  What was he wearing?  A blouse  A blouse  Of course he was  Oh yeah  Let's rock and roll  Whoa 
[02:12:30]  Wow  Now if that doesn't sound like a construction worker  I don't know what  Rivaling Paul on that one  I don't remember any of this  The weirdest was  What are you building?  A giant penis?  You know in the Discovery Channel  When they're out filming lions, tigers, or bears or whatever  And they get that awesome shot  There was a moment in the session  Where Steve flubbed up and actually growls  And it sounds very bearish  Some dude didn't  Some dude  He didn't like my game 
[02:13:00]  Some dude told me he didn't like my game  Little growl there  Growl like a bear  Some dude  Wait, my motivation  Some dude  Some dude  Some dude  Some dude  That's terrible  I'm sorry  And then the engineer  Had to tell him a few times  That he was popping his peas  When you're speaking on a microphone  Especially they have this beautiful microphone at Rockstar  This Neumann  That has a huge diaphragm on it  And if you 
[02:13:30]  Your pea  It ends up hitting the diaphragm  And it's an unusable take  Yeah  And so Steve had a couple of peep-ops  Which we all do  We all do a few peep-ops  Yeah  But the engineer  You can't hear the engineer  But he goes through to Steve's headphones  And says you're popping your peas  Did I?  I knew it  I knew it  I wish I was this picky  When I was doing production on my own  But drums cover up a lot of s**t  Drums cover up a lot of s**t  Oh, they do 
[02:14:00]  Thanks, Laval  However, they don't cover as much  As you think they do  Evidently not  Thank you, Aslo  I'm sorry to throw you in  Oh, that's great  Oh, yeah  No, the bus wheels weren't on my chest for an hour  Yeah, thanks  I love it  What is he hiding?

[02:30:30]  Here at XM Satellite Radio, the ONA virus.  Pretty good fart in the elevator for Jimmy.  Had us all laughing as we came out.  That was a good one.  Two Asian women in the elevator. 
[02:31:00]  And right when the doors shut at the lobby, Jimmy blasted one out.  Nice volume, nice tone.  Like this.  Yeah, very loud.  I get chicken chili.  Oh, goody.  How fattening is that?  I don't know.  I don't eat a lot of it.  Don't whisper at me.  All right.  I need a little bowl.  I need the little bread bag with the spoon. 
[02:31:30]  Just all the accoutrement.  Ooh.  Accoutrement.  Accoutrement.  Is it accoutrement?  You know, I stopped off at...  You ever go back to your old haunt?  Sure.  Your old haunts back these days?  Oh, and then you realize they cemented up the hole in between the stalls?  I went to Apollo Air Conditioning yesterday.  Wow.  Yeah.  Because it's kind of...  It was kind of where I was going. 
[02:32:00]  I was on my way.  And some of my old bosses, a couple of people that worked there that I knew, still there.  Still there.  Are they happy to see you?  Doing their thing.  Yeah.  They fans of the show?  It was fun.  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah, listen to the show.  My boss, my supervisor there, Bob, he's got another year to go there.  He just started working when I worked there.  Another year and he retires.  You know what's funny is that they probably... 
[02:32:30]  That tub story you told about how you dropped something and broke your tub?  Yeah.  I hope they charge you for that.  Well, they also brought up the fact that I told the story of hauling my jet ski with my work van.  When I was supposed to be working.  They brought that up.  That was so fun.  Yeah.  Dropped in on my old pals from Apollo Air Conditions yesterday.  I called you when you were there.  And Bob had showed up when we were on the phone. 
[02:33:00]  You know, talking ratings and stuff.  Yeah, what a buzzkill today over there, huh?  Well, early on.  When we first got there.  Sorry for stating the obvious.  But why did I not get a...  Why did I just get a spoon?  Because Steve is gay.  Steve's an ass.  All right.  I want a complete package of bread unopened with a little truffle thing.  Here's a...  Oh.  I have a spoon.  I don't eat the truffles.  There are no truffles. 
[02:33:30]  Mind you...  All right.  Give me that goddamn bread.  Just give me the goddamn bread.  Give him the fucking bread, Hawk.  Take a spoon.  Thank you, Hawk.  Give him the goddamn bread.  I don't eat the whole thing.  He doesn't eat the whole thing he said.  All right.  Listen.  I know the soup's important, but I don't want to lose this call.  We got Honey on the phone.  She is the 500-plus pound girl that wants to come in.  Oh, Honey.  For Fatty Pig Fatty.  Honey!  Honey!  Why?  I love the fact that we got girls with stripper names that are, uh, Honey, 500 pounds that  want in on this contest.  Fatty Pig Fatty. 
[02:34:00]  What's up, Honey?  How you doing, Honey?  How you doing?  Good.  Um, you show your 500-plus?  541 last weigh-in.  541.  And when was that?  When was that weigh-in?  About two months ago.  What?  About two months ago.  All right.  You're at more than 541.  You think you gained or lost since then?  I'm the same.  Hmm.  Uh, can you move around a lot?  Yeah, I can move around a lot. 
[02:34:30]  How old are you?  30.  30.  Right on.  How'd you get so big?  Eating?  Nope.  Thinking about you.  Nah, I mean, you just like to eat?  Is that...  Is that it?  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  It's a bunch of everything.  Glandular problem?  No glands.  No?  Is this the heaviest you've been?  Yeah.  Well, uh, do you listen to the show?  No, a friend of mine do.  Yeah.  Well, we're paying $10 a pound to the heaviest girl that comes in here. 
[02:35:00]  That's a lot of money, honey.  That would be 5,410 pounds for you.  Mm-hmm.  Plus $1,000 to the person that brings you here.  What do you do for a living?  I chill out.  Just chill out?  I'm a housewife.  Oh.  Uh, you got a man?  I have a husband.  You got a man?  I got a man.  Is he a chubby chaser?  I got a man. 
[02:35:30]  He's a chubby ch...  I know.  We're real funny.  I'm sorry, but...  God, if this all it takes, Jesus.  But yeah, I have a husband.  He make money?  He makes money.  Yeah, a lot?  He makes a pretty penny.  All right.  How much did you weigh when you got married?  I don't know.  How much did I weigh a year ago?  About a year, though.  I don't know about sports and some change, because after my son, I gained weight. 
[02:36:00]  After your what?  After the son.  After my baby.  Okay.  After your baby.  All right.  So who did you get birth to?  Under the Giant?  No.  My baby, Joseph.  Justice?  Well, I thought the other way.  After the son.  After she started orbiting around it.  So ugly.  That was a reason.  Yeah.  Why don't you come down?  You actually can't win the contest.  Yeah, you could use, like, over five grand, can't you? 
[02:36:30]  Did I say dollar instead of dollars?  Whatever.  Jason, give me a break today.  Honey, you could use, like, five grand, right?  Yeah.  Who can't, right?  So why don't you make the trip down?  All right.  That's what we're working on.  We just wanted to call, and he said you guys, you know, wanted us to call first.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll be honest with you, honey.  I don't think anyone's beating 541 pounds.  No.  You're a big gal.  So that means just you hang out.  We weigh you. 
[02:37:00]  If you don't want your face on the internet, we got, like, a...  A little mask.  We got a mask or a paper bag you can wear.  You can change your name.  Maybe you already did.  I don't know.  Don't even tell us at this point.  And then you walk away with 5,410 pounds thanks to H57.com.  A lot of money.  And they'll even give you the H57 to see if you can lose some pounds with that.  Yeah.  If you feel like losing weight, why not?  Why not?  I say you don't lose the weight, though.  I say you get fatter.  Just be you.  Why not?  Just be you. 
[02:37:30]  You're a proud big girl, right?  Yes.  I look good.  What's your favorite sexual position?  All of them.  You can move around a little bit in that bed.  You nimble.  You might even be able to throw in a 1-800-mattress bed.  Whatever it takes to get this done.  I got to see, honey.  Okay.  All right, honey, so where are we at?  Can you come down tomorrow?  Yeah.  When can you come down here? 
[02:38:00]  You're talking tomorrow?  Well, whatever.  I mean, it's up to you.  We're just trying to negotiate here.  We want to enter you in a contest that we think you have a very good shot at winning,  which will pay you over $5,000 for doing nothing but coming down here and standing on a scale.  You're not going to find that anywhere else.  Yeah.  I know.  We're not going to be mean to you either.  We're actually a lot nicer than you think we are.  Yeah, we'll be real nice.  We're silly geese.  I'm not worried about that.  I'm all right.  Oh, okay.  We could have snacks, whatever you need.  What do you need?  You like ringdings? 
[02:38:30]  What's your favorite snack?  Snack of choice.  We'll have it here.  In abundance.  What do you like?  I have my snack right here already.  Entenmann's?  What is your snack?  A wild boar.  What's your favorite snack, honey?  I don't have a favorite snack.  Yeah, you do.  Yeah, we all have favorite snacks.  Come on.  I like peanut butter cookies.  I like Nilla wafers.  I like peanut butter cups.  Ew.  I hate peanut butter.  Yeah, Reese's peanut butter cups.  No, Godiva.  Homemade peanut butter.  Really?  I never had one. 
[02:39:00]  That's my little downfall right there, honey.  Where'd you get them?  That sounds like to die for.  It's terrific.  Oh, it'll be my death.  They make them fresh every day, Jimmy.  Where do you get a little peanut butter cups?  I like Nilla wafers and ginger snaps.  Ew.  That's two of the faggiest cookies.  They're delicious.  Wait, what do you like?  And Nilla wafers.  Nilla wafers.  Nilla wafers.  Nilla.  Nilla wafers.  And ginger snaps.  Out of everything you could choose, I like Nilla wafers.  You like them better than Oreos?  But it wouldn't be on my top ten.  No, I wouldn't eat Oreos.  You like fucking Nilla wafers better than chocolate cake? 
[02:39:30]  Anthony doesn't eat anything that's black.  No, no, I don't eat things like that.  Yeah.  He hates to be reminded.  No.  Of course you like Nilla wafers that are pure and white.  You are white, Arian cookie.  That's right.  We'd love you to come down.  Not a problem.  I'll be there.  Okay.  That's just how I'm convinced.  That's all right.  You don't want to win five grand.  I don't want to win five grand.  I know.  Wait, you're not coming down?  Five large.  Say that again?  She said she's going to, but she doesn't sound convincing. 
[02:40:00]  I don't sound convincing.  Yeah.  You're going to do it?  Convincing, you want me to be?  What time you're coming?  Oh, I see what people are saying.  I have somebody else bringing me to you guys.  He's on the phone.  So I don't...  You have to ranger with him.  Oh, I've been saying you can win 5,410 pounds instead of dollars.  Now I get it.  All right.  That's a lot of dollars.  All right.  You should beat me up for that.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm not a sensitive person.  Y'all just say what you want to say.  Don't make me like you mean...  All right.  Let's cut to the chase. 
[02:40:30]  You coming down here?  Yeah, I'm coming down here.  Did I say I was?  All right.  What day?  What day, Bob?  Well, Wednesday worked.  Not this Wednesday, but the following Wednesday worked the best for us.  So we were going to talk to the producer, find out what you guys still scheduled like and go from there.  Okay.  Bob, are you Honey's Honey?  I'm Honey's friend.  I'm Honey's handler.  Handler.  Okay.  Well, yeah.  Well, Bob will get $1,000 just for getting Honey in the door here.  Yep. 
[02:41:00]  That's pretty cool.  A finder's fee.  I like that.  And I think we might even throw a few more dollars at you for just coming down just in case someone does beat you.  But I honestly don't think anyone's going to beat you.  No.  And it's my job to, like, play it the other way.  Like, yeah, you know, I think we could even do better.  Let's be honest with each other.  I don't think anyone's beating 541 pounds.  Throw a few dollars at her, some biplanes.  Yeah, you know.  What kind of snacks, Honey?  A Whopper with cheese.  Ah, yeah. 
[02:41:30]  All right, we can do that.  We love Whoppers with cheese.  Is Whopper Burger King?  Yep.  All right, we got Burger King coupons, too, today.  Remember that song?  We'll save a few for you.  Who's got the best darn burgers in the whole wide world?  Hardee's.  Hardee's.  Burger King and I.  Oh, that was Hardee's.  And then the Burger King would run in with his little crown on.  Yes, I do.  And he'd swing his cock.  And everybody would laugh and clap.  Slap it on a Whopper bun.  Yeah.  Feed it to a kid.  Make the kids eat it, and then stop eating it, and then eat it, and then stop eating it. 
[02:42:00]  And then hide it in their hineys.  Mama, the Burger King put his hamburger in my hiney.  He said he was making me a special deputy.  I'm a prince.  I'm a prince.  I'm a special prince.  He used my buns.  He said that was his hamburger, and I had sesame seed buns.  But I had blood in my underwears.  Mama, the Burger King made blood come in my underwears.  All right.  Jesus. 
[02:42:30]  Mama, I just wanted to go in and have French fries, but the Burger King put my face on the  counter and put blood in my underwears, because he said I had sesame seed buns.  And then he put Burger King sauce all over my hair and face, and then he hit me.  Mama, he hit me.  And there was little hash browns in my underpants.  When the Burger King stopped using my buns, there was little hash browns in my underpants. 
[02:43:00]  And my hiney burned like someone put hot apple pie sauce in it.  Someone poured a hot apple pie sauce in my hiney.  Poor little unknowing kid.  All right.  We're going to get honey down here, it looks like.  Yeah, we're coming.  That would be great.  All right.  You guys know what to do.  You got a contact.  You want to be put on hold.  What do you need?  Well, we're going to get in touch with your guys and set up a date, and we'll be down.  We'll put you on hold and give you the address. 
[02:43:30]  I think they might have one.  All right.  Yeah, hold on, just to make sure everyone's set, okay?  Please hold.  Honey, it was great talking to you.  Yes, sweetheart.  Thank you.  Good luck in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Your buddies will have a pie and just scrolled your mouth.  That's how the boy's asshole felt.  Like that piping hot, roof of your mouth is on fire feeling.  You feel it for days later.  Especially since you're that young, you're so confused.  You don't know what it is.  All you know is, all you remember is some kind of sour breath over your shoulder, and 
[02:44:00]  like, as the pain got really intense, you heard a grunt, and then a hat fell off the  head and landed in front of you.  As he gave that final thrust, he went, and he just, his hat fell off and landed in front  of the lad.  Mama, the man's hat fell off, and then my hiney exploded.  Let's go to Steve in California.  Steve.  Hey, how's it going there?  O&A?  Hey, what's up, Steve? 
[02:44:30]  Hey, I was going to tell Jimmy I watched Lucky Louie last time on HBO, the repeats, but it's  the best show around.  I fucking love it.  It's great.  Well, thank you, man.  If you loved it, let HBO know it, because they canceled it, so I appreciate you enjoying  it.  You got it, buddy.  Thank you, man.  Damn them.  That's it?  All right.  Damn them.  Well, we'll take a break.  We'll regroup.  We got things to do today.  We got the Mike Tyson audio we still haven't played.  Right.  We got John Mark Carr from Larry King.  We haven't played that yet.  I guess we're up to 300 million Americans officially.  Yeah, but they're saying the 300 millionth American has already crossed over the border 
[02:45:00]  from Mexico.  Yeah.  What, they were trying to make it a big thing?  Yeah, like, as far as the population of America goes.  It doesn't count.  But they say it's just been illegals already have crossed over the border.  They've crossed over the 300 million Americans.  And they counted honey 400 times.  Honey.  Yeah.  It's time for another Opie and Anthony Show scream-along. 
[02:45:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Okay.  Terrific.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, this is a fun article. 
[02:46:00]  It's Robert Fetter again.  Will he come on our show?  Can we get Robert Fetter on?  It's strong.  Free FM still in throes of ratings free fall.  This is, what is this, Chicago Sun-Times maybe?  Yeah.  Yeah, all right, Chicago Sun-Times.  Our ratings in Chicago, just absolutely awful.  But not our ratings yet.  We haven't been on in Chicago long enough for us to take responsibility for the bad ratings 
[02:46:30]  and morning drive at this station we're on in Chicago.  It's still at least like two months of Rovers ratings.  It says, and we have to be the highlight of the whole article.  Like the book came out for Chicago and New York yesterday.  Today it's L.A.  And then another city we're not on in.  And then tomorrow it starts with all the stations we're on.  All the cities we're on.  Philly, Boston, Washington, all them start coming in tomorrow.  But Robert Fetter, you know, does his rating summary of what's going on in the market.  And it says, the headline, Free FM still in throes of ratings free fall. 
[02:47:00]  He writes, everything that's wrong with CBS radio can be summed up in four letters.  W.C.K.G.  Arbitron ratings released Monday for the summer quarter delivered another catastrophic blow  to the Free FM talk station.  Whoa.  And this is why we've got to get him on the phone.  The syndicated duo of Greg Opie Hughes and Anthony Cumia proved no more popular in mornings  than the dog they replaced, Shane Rover French. 
[02:47:30]  Because it's still Shane Rover French's numbers.  Christ on a pony.  We didn't start there when we started here.  We picked up markets as we went along.  We got New York first.  We were here first.  We're doing very well here.  But we had to sit there while the fucking David Lee Roth numbers went away.  Someone's correcting me.  It's feeder, I guess.  All right.  Who knows?  Feeder.  It's one E.  Excuse me. 
[02:48:00]  Cockhead is how I pronounce it.  Cockhead.  And the parentheses, in parentheses, he writes, the solution, of course, is still man-cow.  Is it?  And, wow.  As a result, for the second straight quarter, WCKG wound up below a 1.0 share of all listeners.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeek. 
[02:48:30]  So, can we get John, uh...  Feeder, Fetter?  Robert.  I mean, Robert Feeder.  Yeah, get this brave guy that, that...  What?  He's not in yet.  It's only 840 in Chicago.  Who gives a shit?  You're a fucking reporter.  Be there early.  Yeah, Clark.  Report.  You, you fraud.  Jeff in Chicago, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey, I want to tell you, uh, uh, you know, you guys are the only program on CKG that is  worth a shit.  You know, you got all these other boring programs all day and all night long.  We don't even know who's on there.  I mean, we like Steve Dahl a lot. 
[02:49:00]  Um, I don't know who else is on.  Yeah, Steve Dahl's having a tough time as well, uh, in Chicago.  Don Likus is on there, and he'll...  Don Likus is on there, and he'll bore you to death.  Yeah, he...  I mean, Steve Dahl still gets it done, but not like...  Yeah, right.  Like he used to...  But, you know, everybody waits for your program as soon as your program's over.  Well, that's...  I mean, that's nice, but to keep it fair, you know, we're not...  We don't have ratings yet in Chicago, so it's still...  It's too early to tell what kind of effect we're going to have in the Chicago radio market.  Who's on after us, dude?  Uh, I don't even remember you.  It's so boring, I just turned the channel, so after your program, I... 
[02:49:30]  Hey, when is Tom Likus on?  Because he talks in his real voice.  Oh, geez, come on.  Yeah, right.  Uh, Stan and Terry are on after us.  Yeah.  Anyway...  Right?  You have to have a good morning.  I'm going to punch out.  On their website, it says, Stan and Terry, relaxed like the temptations.  Okay.  What?  That's their slug line.  I don't know what that means.  Oh, right?  I don't know what that means.  Penn Jillette, then, is on from one to two.  His slug line is the larger and louder half. 
[02:50:00]  Steve Dahl, been there, done that.  Jim Cramer, making your money, or making you money.  Likus 100, adult education.  Bill O'Reilly, and Bill O'Reilly, the factor.  Why could...  What was Likus's...  What was Likus's called?  Adult education?  Yeah, yeah.  He does like his 101.  With fat, boring cunt taken.  Like him to be raped by a man in a Burger King hat.  Let's say hi to Rob in Chicago. 
[02:50:30]  There I was as a child.  Yeah, my face is on the counter, and he had hat head.  And the hat fell off in front of me.  Rob?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  The first advertising for the show that I've seen of any kind was this past week.  The billboards went up, and I started seeing bus signs, and they're shared between you and Steve Dahl.  That's cool.  That's still too early.  That's what pisses me off, though.  This guy, what is his name?  Robert Fetter.  Fetter.  Yeah, we should just say Fetter.  Fetter.  Fetter.  Fetter. 
[02:51:00]  He's saying that we're failing, and he knows radio.  Oh, he knows it's too early.  The guy knows he's being a fucking little cunt about it.  Yes.  Get him on the phone.  Wake him up.  Give me his home number.  We love Steve Dahl, even though he's on the cover of The Post today.  Let me say.  I love you, Jimmy.  Thanks, buddy.  I'm going to tell on you.  I love you.  I'm calling Steve Dahl right now.  All right, well, we'll wait for the boys to get Robert Fetter.  Fetter.  On the phone.  Where'd you get that fruit?  Jesus, that looks good. 
[02:51:30]  Don't touch my fruit.  I want some of that fruit.  You can't have my fruit.  Can somebody get me some fruit?  You bet.  You can't have any of my fruit.  I want somebody to get me the same fruit that Opie has.  Don't touch my fruit.  That is the worst.  Do I have to say it like that?  What?  Yeah.  Fruit.  Right.  That I've ever seen.  Why?  What's wrong with my fruit?  There's too much citrus.  Yeah.  What is it?  What's in it?  Oranges.  There's oranges.  Is that grapefruit?  Grapefruit.  Say it right. 
[02:52:00]  Grapefruit.  And then what?  Pineapple?  Pineapple and orange.  You are looking at an acid bath.  Well, I'm hoping because this fruit hopefully will make me shit.  Where did you get that?  I haven't shit.  Melon.  In a day and a half.  You got any cantaloupe and honeydew?  Start taking the stuff that that doctor gave us.  Oh, I don't know.  What do you think?  Oh, I don't know.  I wouldn't take a chance.  Do you know where to get that fruit?  Hey, Jimmy.  I'm thinking colonics.  All right.  You're really thinking colonics?  I'm thinking of going to the weirdo doctor, too. 
[02:52:30]  I think it would be easier just to get the colonics done.  Jimmy, what do you think?  Instead of going through the powder and the pills.  I'm going to try the powder.  I'm going to do the colonics.  And the colonics might hurt your butt just a little bit.  I'm going to kind of do the powder.  What do you mean it's going to hurt my butt?  When they put something in there, there's a squirt water in there.  Unless you're used to things being in your butt, which I don't think you are.  I certainly wasn't.  It takes a little bit of getting used to.  Oh, I see where you're going.  I see where you're going with this.  I see.  All right.  What do you got cooking in your oven over here?  Oh, see here. 
[02:53:00]  Now we get to the bottom of the issue.  And this is why Robert Feeder, fetter, fuckface, has to call our show.  See, we got some inside guys in Chicago.  Vince, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey there, Vince.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Thanks, Vince.  Hey, if you get a hold of Feeder, ask him why he's always had such a hard-on for Mad Cow.  Has he?  He's always supported Mad Cow?  Always.  I just want to Mad Cow's guy.  I have no problem with that, but let's at least be fair and tell him. 
[02:53:30]  You're reporting in a fucking newspaper.  This guy is supposed to put facts in there.  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair, Judge.  Sir, I want to put facts in there, and the guy is full of shit.  Hey, sir, which guy do you mean?  Which reporter?  Feeder.  Feeder.  Feeder, yeah.  Feeder, yeah.  Feeder.  And don't call on Monday because he doesn't work on Monday.  Well, it's Tuesday.  Who is he?  Johnny Carson?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Yeah, fudge.  We're just staying on fruit.  Yeah, what kind of fruit do you like? 
[02:54:00]  Fruit.  I like grapes.  Yeah, I like grapes.  I don't like melons when it comes to fruit.  You know what?  I got a problem with grapes.  I got to eat them all.  I don't like figs.  Would you like me to cut you a fig, perhaps?  What are you?  Ancient Rome?  No, I was eating a salad recently, and it had figs in it.  My salad was chock full of figs.  Ugh, fig.  I'd rather have fucking rhinoceros balls sliced in half and tossed into my salad than figs. 
[02:54:30]  You know what figs are all about when you eat fruit?  It comes out like figs.  Aw.  I don't want figs.  They look like those eye things that develop on fat people's eyeballs and fucking on fat people's necks.  Aw.  Look, he's got a fig farm on his neck.  I don't want to kiss him.  He's fat and has a fig farm on his neck.  All right, man.  Fruit is good for you to call on, bro.  Dude, I eat a lot of fruit.  I'm not saying fruit is bad. 
[02:55:00]  I'm only saying I don't like figs.  How does anybody like grapefruit?  It's beyond me.  I like it.  It is a sour, bitter tasting.  It's not sweet at all.  Look at the color.  That's not sweet.  It's like a ruby red pussy.  It doesn't matter.  It's sour and bitter.  Exactly.  It's not sweet at all.  Watch.  No, watch.  Oh, he's good.  Piece of grapefruit.  Fruit.  Fruit. 
[02:55:30]  It's good for you.  Oh, my God.  It's horrible.  It is pretty sour.  It's turd.  It's sour and bitter and awful grapefruit.  An orange is good because it's like a grapefruit, only sweet.  See how much more relaxed we are over here?  That was a buzzkill today, man.  I'm pissed off.  We gave the station good ratings, and we ended up getting yelled at.  That's what happens.  Why should anything change?  I got a bubble in my throat.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, it certainly is.  I have a smoothie bubble in my throat.  You know what you need to fucking...  Like I just took a load of cum.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:56:00]  Kiwis.  Best fruit?  No, I don't fucking...  Off kiwis annoy me.  It's a little seedy flavor.  They're too...  Oh!  No.  I like blueberries when they're in season, and I like strawberries.  Boobies could be my favorite.  Right?  Honeydew.  Oh, I don't know.  What do you think?  Oh, fuck, honeydew.  Right in the mouth.  And cantaloupe.  Oh, cantaloupe is for queers.  Cantaloupe stinks.  Cantaloupe is fucking rookie fruit.  Then call me faggot, because I love it.  All right, why don't we move on with the show? 
[02:56:30]  I like to play with the little crocodile head that I have here.  Let's do that.  That is really sick.  It's a little baby alligator head.  Capitated alligator head you play with.  I want to tease children with this.  We got stuff to do.  I want to wave this to children and just go, bite, bite, chew, chew.  And then scrape their little fingers with the teeth.  By the way, we were being polite because we were being heard on Free FM in New York.  The ratings for the rest of the day are just...  Abominable.  Un-fucking-believable.  So we were...  Unfathomable.  So we were actually trying to be cool about the whole thing this morning. 
[02:57:00]  We really were.  We really were.  Yeah, they don't listen to XM anyway.  You know, whatever.  If they do, they do.  We were trying to be nice.  Trying to be nice.  I'm not kidding.  They could turn off the station after our show.  And save on the electric bill.  And we're just frustrated because every place we go, we're in the same situation.  We said the same line at N.E.W.  Yep.  They could turn off the station.  You know what's sad about this situation?  I was looking at N.E.W. ratings.  They were a little higher than Free FM. 
[02:57:30]  They were higher.  Yeah.  I'm like, well, at least in the old days, we were over here.  We're a little higher.  When back in the old days, they were talking about what a horror show N.E.W. was ratings-wise.  They were better ratings than where we are now.  Way better.  In New York.  I don't like the name Free FM.  I think it's reactionary.  I like the name K-Rock better, man.  I don't like the names like Jack and all this fancy shit.  The name Free FM, I just don't like.  I like K-Rock.  I liked K-Rock in New York when it was just K-Rock. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  It's K-Rock.  Yeah.  It has more personality.  Yeah.  Put some fucking music and stop playing faggoty fucking music playlist.  Stop playing the same shit.  They switched it.  They put K-Rock somewhere else.  Now they're doing FM.  Oh, my God.  Get me some sugar.  Get me some-  See?  Look.  It's so sour.  Are you having a problem eating your fruit?  Oh, my goodness.  I told you.  It's Tark.  Why did you do it?  Is it Tark?  Why did you do it? 
[02:58:30]  Fucking lunatics.  We're punch drunk from being beat up this morning.  Oh, my God.  We were just like kind of start a show, celebrating the fact that we had a pretty good book in New York.  I mean, we got a ways to go, but we're moving up, especially in the demos, and that's all that matters.  And then all of a sudden, Tom comes in and just curses us out.  How is that good for us in the station?  Kenny, am I allowed to have one sugar packet on my fruit? 
[02:59:00]  Isn't there enough fructose in the fruit?  Fructose?  You know, it's to fruct yourself.  Kenny, if I get a smoothie like that again, throw it in the savage's face that made it.  You know, I was thinking the same thing.  It was a rookie-  What was wrong with you?  Smoothie assembler.  What did you think was wrong with it when you saw it?  I just knew when he stepped up to the plate to make it like-  It wasn't going to be good.  Yeah, he was a little off.  There's too much of whatever they use.  What are they using, skim milk?  And then I saw from the color. 
[02:59:30]  Yep.  The color was too light.  It was too milky.  He got something out of his private pump.  You think he fucking jacked off in my smoothie?  No, I think he popped a cyst into it.  He squeezed it.  He had a back cyst.  An ass cyst.  He injured himself picking figs.  And he had a back cyst.  No, believe me.  I'm sorry.  You go.  Sorry.  You were done.  Yeah, I knew.  You were done.  Wow.  I knew when I saw it.  And I should have just had it sent back when I took that first sip. 
[03:00:00]  But I drank the whole thing.  But it wasn't good banana-y.  I like them banana-y.  I tell them exactly like that, too.  And it was a bunch of fucking milk with a little bit of banana and barely a trace of strawberry.  All right, listen.  Set.  Tank, call the show, please.  Please, Tank.  Call the show.  Tank.  What does Tank want?  Don't hide behind your instant feedback and call the show.  There's not many people calling right now, so you'll get right through. 
[03:00:30]  So, wasn't Tank, uh, Mrs. Brady's, uh, boyfriend that came to visit?  And I will test you with your last name.  He writes...  And Robert Reed fucked him in the ass while he slept.  Gay maids.  We have too many new listeners that really don't get the program yet.  They just don't.  They don't.  We really haven't changed that much as far as our delivery.  What seems to be his fucking problem.  And our take as far as doing a radio show.  Tank writes, do you guys have to be such insecure douches about every person that says anything about your show?  How about do an entertaining show and stop being prima donnas and maybe people won't talk shit about the ratings? 
[03:01:00]  Hey, ass, maybe when the ratings come out once every three months, we like to fucking discuss them, you cunt.  You little fucking cunt bag.  Please, please live in New York so you can come down here.  Come down here because I want to watch other people beat you up.  Tank on the phone?  The phone's an outlet.  I'm much too slender.  Nah, we're going to have a bunch of fake tanks now. 
[03:01:30]  You are svelte.  See, tank.  See, we call people out on stuff.  Yeah.  When Robert Federer, feeder, fooder, writes about the rating summary in the Chicago Sun-Times.  Yeah.  And then blatantly ignores the fact that we have nothing to do with this ratings book.  It bothers us.  I'm sorry.  Tank, let's say someone wrote a story about you that you were a heterosexual that didn't like to only fuck your father in the asshole. 
[03:02:00]  See, that would be upsetting to you, wouldn't it?  Because you know that's true.  You have to think, Tank.  You fuck your father in his asshole.  And if someone wrote and said you didn't, that would be a lie, and you'd have to call him out on it.  That's right.  You ass.  Jesus.  Why can't we ever just be a show that just skips merrily along and bitches about things when they get brought up, and we have fun when we're in a fun mood and things like that.  This is what this is.  And do we bitch every time someone badmouths? 
[03:02:30]  Yes.  What do you do in your fucking life?  If you find out someone's badmouthing you, what do you do?  Just shrug your shoulders?  That's the beauty of being on the radio.  Anyone that badmouths Lucky Louie or me, I badmouth.  Anyone badmouths this show, we badmouth back.  Tank here.  What's wrong with you?  You can relate to this.  When you're making the French fries every day, and it gets back to you that people aren't digging your French fries that day, what are you doing?  He don't care.  He spits in it.  You're blowing snot rockets into the French fries, right? 
[03:03:00]  You're not just going, well, that's one guy's opinion, and I better just continue making good French fries here.  That's right.  You should be dating Margaret Houlihan with that name.  Tank.  Little man.  Tank, is that you?  It's me.  Tank.  Yuck.  Tank.  What is it?  Maybe you were athletic in high school, but now you're a big fat fuck.  His first name is...  And they still call you Tank.  His first name is Septic.  Because he's full of shit.  Oh, language. 
[03:03:30]  Yes.  I wouldn't take it there.  Tank.  Is Tank calling?  He won't call.  Maybe one of these tanks is on the phone.  Another brave fucking asshole.  They're all brave online.  Yep.  All fucking brave.  Why do we need to put our names if we badmast the show?  You don't need to, but why wouldn't you want to?  And plus the fact it sets up for another fine bit, because we'll go at it with the guy.  That's fun to listen to.  People like that.  Do we have Tank on the phone?  There's a bunch of phone calls coming in.  It's lit.  Nah. 
[03:04:00]  No tanks.  Oh, Tank.  Where are you, Tank?  He's a faggot.  He ain't calling.  That's right.  He's a fucking little faggot.  Why do we bitch?  Because we read lies about us, Tank.  That's right, Tank.  You dickbag.  All right.  There was an article written that said your mother isn't a whore.  Wouldn't you be upset because you know that cunt face is a whore?  Right, Tank?  Well, no surprise.  Tank has decided not to call the show. 
[03:04:30]  All right.  What do you think, Tank?  All right.  Keep being brave behind your computer screen.  All of them that are.  Oh, they disgust me.  You have an opportunity to call any day you want.  But instead, you'll hide behind a keyboard, right?  Just type away.  All right.  Give me something funny to talk about.  So they introed America's 300th millionth person.  Great. 
[03:05:00]  This isn't the real one.  What nationality was this?  They just guessed.  What was it, by the way?  It wasn't a white God-fearing American, was it?  I'll say Hispanic.  They are the fastest growing population here in this country.  So odds are.  Hey, where are you going?  It's just...  Oh, boy.  And now it's just a shitstorm.  Yeah, we...  Language.  Because people are just dumb. 
[03:05:30]  Duck.  Chicago.  Yeah, what...  What the fuck, guys?  What's up, Duck?  Listen to this one.  Listen to this one.  You wonder why nobody fucking listens to you.  Why everybody bashed you.  Listen to your fucking New York attitude and think about it.  Hey, what about your Chicago attitude?  Chicago, you cocksuckers.  Duck.  Hey, that sounds like a good attitude.  Wait, Duck.  Duck.  You don't make sense because you're calling our show.  That means you're listening.  I'm listening and I'm just about fucking tired of the bullshit.  And your attitude isn't very good either.  If you want anybody to listen, why don't you just fucking lighten up some and quit thinking 
[03:06:00]  that New Yorkers are holier than fucking dollars?  No one said New Yorkers...  Dude, what does New Yorkers have to do with anything?  You're not getting the point, Duck.  Whether we succeed or fail in Chicago, what we're trying to say today, it's too early  to tell, and we want to call out Robert Feeder on that.  Yeah.  What's New Yorkers...  What's wrong with that?  And fuck, Tank.  Get off the fucking...  You guys are the greatest thing in the world.  So what?  Who said we were?  All right, wait.  Give us... 
[03:06:30]  Hold on.  Duck, duck, duck.  Give us one example where we said we're the greatest thing in the world.  Or give us one example of our New York attitude.  Okay, New York attitude.  Yeah.  Detroit.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, the Midwest.  Oh, jeez.  The Midwest.  We're not a bunch of fucking yokels.  We're not a bunch of fucking idiots.  We didn't say that.  We were talking about the South, you idiots.  Yeah, we all could agree the South stinks.  Right?  No.  No, because...  No.  No, you can't agree that the South stinks.  Why do you guys think...  We're just...  We're just kidding with that statement, too. 
[03:07:00]  He was kidding.  Duck doesn't really get the...  What's wrong with you, duck?  You don't get sarcasm.  You don't get just...  Duck.  The point is as follows.  Gentlemen, the point is as follows.  Veter's a dick.  Veter's been attacked.  Better.  Everything to do with CKG forever.  All right, so why can't we call him out on it, finally?  Why can't we call him out on it?  Everyone else just...  But everyone else just...  Veter doesn't fucking count to your listeners.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, duck.  It makes for good radio.  If this guy's been putting down WCKG and he loves man cow forever, why not? 
[03:07:30]  Why don't we call him out on it and have...  And smash him.  And smash him and then get him on the air and see if he's brave enough to discuss this.  Why not?  On a professional level.  He's not brave enough to discuss it on a professional level.  Veter's been lying behind his column for 20 fucking years.  What would Doug, what would you do?  And, Doug, Doug, could I ask you this?  Is this the type of show we're doing today, because we're in pissy moods about everything,  is this the show that is indicative of this program, the show that we do every day? 
[03:08:00]  Not even today's show.  Just a little bit of today's show is a bitch fest.  Yeah.  We moved on after Tom Chiasano said, fuck you.  Yes.  Your shows are great.  There's nobody ever saying that your shows aren't good.  You got a couple...  Doug, Tom Chiasano put us in a bad mood, because, you know, we were just speaking the truth.  We were frustrated.  We have a passion to do radio.  And, you know, we spoke our mind.  We were going to move on.  And he actually mouthed the words, fuck you, to the show that's getting in the ratings.  That kind of... 
[03:08:30]  I mean, we had fun with it on the air, but it was kind of a bummer.  I'm not going to lie to you here.  It took the air right out of the room this morning.  Like, oh, great.  You guys made a great comeback.  Jimmy's been on a roll.  You guys have all been on a fucking roll.  Fuck feeder.  Dude, we came up with a new bit today, Doug.  What about fruit?  We want to...  We want to...  Doug, we want to beat up feeder, because what would you do?  First of all, we do five hours a day.  If someone's bad-mouthing you, why wouldn't we address that?  Like, it's annoying on a personal level, so we're not so detached that we won't address it. 
[03:09:00]  Why wouldn't we?  Like, as a guy, if someone was bad-mouthing you, wouldn't you want to get them on the phone  or address them?  Of course you would.  Well, normally, Jim, when I address someone, I'm always face-to-face with everybody every  day.  Well, it's hard on the radio.  Yeah, that would be nice if we could be, but there's too many fucking cowards out there.  The most we can come is to at least getting the guy on the phone and addressing it.  And, you know, what's wrong with having an argument with a guy or listening?  You know, why not?  Because you're going to beat this thing to death.  Beater's never going to call.  Better.  You're never going to respond.  That's the kind of cowards you're going to do. 
[03:09:30]  Hold on, dude.  We will not beat it to death.  We've been pretty good about that.  The old show, we used to beat things into the ground.  Oh, my God.  And we...  All right, all right.  You got me on that one.  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  Thanks for the advice, Doug.  But it's still too early to tell if we're going to fail or succeed in Chicago.  You're going to succeed in Chicago.  Everybody out here loves you.  We're not Robert Feeder.  Fetter.  We're not Feeder.  Fetter.  We're going to have a fucking Spurs.  Spurs didn't survive.  It's Fetter, isn't it?  He sucked.  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Thank you.  They're a duck. 
[03:10:00]  Just trying to help.  He's with the New York attitude, and he's just yelling.  He sounds like the fucking...  Like Dennis Frina.  Yeah.  I'm going to cook a hot dinner, and I'm going to find your wife, and I'm going to kill her, too.  How do you not love Chicago?  Who was trying to work out a duck, duck, goose joke in their head?  I honestly got to do your thing.  I was trying.  Chuck, what's up?  Hey, I just want to say...  Wait, wait.  Did we go from duck to Chuck?  Yeah.  Suck, duck, Chuck.  Well, you know.  All right.  Go ahead, Chuck.  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, I just want to say...  What's up, Chuck?  Up, Chuck.  It's like a puke joke.  Hey, keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  What?  Up, Chuck.  What?  What's up?  Hey, I just want to say you guys are having a great show.  And when Jimmy said, hit it, me earlier, I nearly shit my pants.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  And just keep up the fucking good work.  I've been listening since Nude Poetry Woman Day back on NEW.  And she beat me up.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  All right. 
[03:11:00]  Bye-bye.  Have fun.  All right.  Well, that's...  Keep bitching.  We love it.  Say what?  You can keep bitching.  We love it.  No, we'll...  I don't mind bitching.  It can be fun to bitch.  I enjoy hearing it.  It can be fun.  And like I said, it's not indicative of this program.  We have days where maybe we'll go off, we'll be a little pissy.  Sorry.  That's the honesty of the show.  We can't come in and put on the radio voice, blah, blah, blah, and then leave and be all pissy.  I'll tell you what frustrates us, because we really were trying to be nice today, but we're sharing ratings with a midday show over at Free FM that's getting absolutely no ratings. 
[03:11:30]  It's just frustrating.  And then it's reported in the paper that Opie and Anthony did this certain number in Morning Drive, but that's rated 6 to 10 a.m.  And these fucking writers know.  We're only responsible for 6 to 9.  They know.  You take the last hour away, and our ratings are very, very impressive, but it'll never be reported that way, and we get really frustrated. 
[03:12:00]  And we get frustrated every month when the ratings come out, and we know what's going on.  And the people that report on radio ratings in the papers here in New York know what's going on, but they refuse to really acknowledge it and kind of tell the real story.  Let's say you do a job.  So we get very frustrated.  You do a job, 8 hours a day, you're supposed to work.  That's your normal business job, for 8 hours a day, and you work on a commission for sales or something like that.  After 6 hours, a blithering idiot retard comes in, blowing snot out his nose, and can't make one fucking sale. 
[03:12:30]  But you're responsible for the entire 8-hour shift.  Wouldn't that annoy the piss out of you that this fucking retard is in there blowing snot bubbles instead of selling, and you're losing out?  And the company letterhead comes out, the little newsletter comes out, and says,  Well, this guy did shitty. 
[03:13:00]  You know, he could be doing better for his 8-hour shift.  And you sit there and go, But I don't work 8 hours of the shift.  A retard comes in for 2 hours.  And instead of you being on the cover with a smile, they have Dirk Banner, regional manager.  Right.  Explaining the new corporate strategy is Dirk Banner.  Dirk Banner, and he's standing in front of a, what are those called, the things you, they made a caulk, like a corkboard.  A corkboard.  Dirk Banner is standing in front of a corkboard. 
[03:13:30]  Dirk Banner.  Clippered.  I ran out of steam on Dirk Banner.  I had a high hopes for him.  Dirk Banner.  That fissled immediately.  Let's go to Mike in South Carolina.  Mike.  Hey, man.  Hey, Mike.  What's your fucking buddy, boy?  This can't be a real boy.  Hey, buddy, they're talking shit about South Carolina.  Boy, you funny, man.  All right.  This can't be your real boy.  What?  South Carolina?  I love South Carolina.  Yeah, boy.  Y'all fuck is funny, man.  I like y'all. 
[03:14:00]  Got relatives down there.  Y'all fuck is fucking laugh.  It's the fucking, it's the Pacific Northwest that I'm talking about we got to goof on, right?  Those guys suck.  Yeah, boy.  Y'all, you come down here and hang out, man.  I love the Midwest, the South.  It's beautiful.  I like the South.  They're fine.  It's the fucking Northeast.  Wait a minute.  All right, Mr. South Carolina laughing character guy.  Jesus.  You cackling goose.  All right. 
[03:14:30]  Good morning, America.  Intros.  America's 300th millionth person.  That's cool.  All right.  How did they choose this person?  On location where poor steps on introduction.  Wouldn't it have been a baby?  Well, they just got to pick someone.  So they probably saw a wet back and said, all right, you're the one.  Well, do they have two reporters?  They have one guy in Wisconsin.  Jesus.  They won in Florida.  They're both looking at, they both have stopwatches eye to eye with a cunt.  All right.  So far, it's just blood and afterbirth.  I got a head.  I got a head. 
[03:15:00]  They should have had a competition.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would have been fun.  Weak it out.  As soon as the fucking, you know how funny it would be if the head popped out and they  were like, wait, wait, wait.  Put the balloons back.  It's not breathing.  Put the balloons back.  Let's go to contestant number two.  The band has to stop.  Send the band away.  The band has to stop playing and the camera like pulls away just to two crying people.  Even better.  Fredo has to send the band away.  Get out of here.  Even better.  The 300 millionth person is our waterhead. 
[03:15:30]  Oh.  All right.  Let's hear.  And it takes all weekend to be born.  All right.  We're watching the clock.  Drum roll, please.  Now for that American milestone.  The 300th millionth American will arrive today in a matter of seconds.  We're two away.  Let's check in with Juju Chang.  I know you're there at the nation's busiest maternity ward in Atlanta.  Are you watching the clock?  One more.  One more Juju. 
[03:16:00]  Is it going to be there?  We're watching the clock.  We missed it by two minutes.  We just had a baby girl born here at 744 a.m.  The good news is she's healthy.  The bad news is she's not the 300th millionth American, as far as we can tell.  Now, based on what democracy tells us, we have just witnessed.  Wait, wait, wait, Juju.  We can't let this moment pass.  The clock just went to 300.  There are now 300 million Americans.  Oh, my God.  Hacking.  In the United States of America.  I was broken fetty, but I'm in a maternity ward.  I was broken fetty, but I'm in a maternity ward.  I guess it would not be appropriate. 
[03:16:30]  Okay.  Go on now, Juju.  I just said to recognize that milestone.  I wish I could see that clock.  You literally, we had a nurse rush in and say, we checked out a baby boy, baby girl born,  but it was 744, so we missed it.  Holy shit.  There's probably fucking 30 kids born at that time.  Yeah.  And it's not 300th million.  It's 300 millionth.  Millionth.  Not 300th.  How many kids do you need?  300th millionth.  That's a lot of people. 
[03:17:00]  Dope.  They missed the moment.  Yeah, they missed the moment.  They didn't have the baby.  They fucked up completely.  They picked a maternity ward in where?  Georgia?  Atlanta.  Well, what about one on Long Island?  Yeah, how about one out fucking in a nice neighborhood?  Can the 300 millionth person in this country born please be white?  Could you just pick a white person for something in this country these days?  Can the president go read to white children? 
[03:17:30]  Speaking of picking a white kid for something, how about president?  I don't know.  I gotta disagree.  I think white people have had a few things sewn up here for a while.  Who cares?  We're defeated.  We're a defeated race.  Hey.  And I speak as only half of one.  But we couldn't figure this out.  Sicilian, you know.  The Moors.  We couldn't figure this out, though.  They just picked a hospital somewhere and said, all right, it'll be from this maternity ward.  Dude, do you think that news fucking program was the actual Census Bureau? 
[03:18:00]  I don't know.  That was a dopey gimmick that went horribly awry.  I want to poop.  I want to poop.  I want to poop.  I want to poop.  I want to poop now.  The whole country's just going to look like Sam in how many years?  That's right.  How many years before we all just are Sam?  Indistinguishable race with feet that point out like idiots.  Big thumbs.  That's fine.  Better to grasp more things. 
[03:18:30]  He's like the evolu...  You've evolved further than everyone else.  But that's fine.  Then there won't be wars at that point.  No wars.  Why?  We're not going to fight over.  Still be land.  We'll have the same religion and the same color.  We'll all just be hippies.  Just Sam.  Hi.  Welcome to Earth.  I'm Sam.  Yes, it is.  No matter where UFO lands.  Hello.  Take me to your leader.  I am.  All right, then let me meet your subjects.  Hi, hi, hi, hi. 
[03:19:00]  We're all the same guy.  Yeah.  Let's go to Candyman.  Got to calm people down.  Candyman.  Hey, nice sales pitch.  How long before XM loses another hour for free FM to get it?  No, no, no.  Then the whole thing collapses next month.  Then the whole thing collapses.  Delicate balance.  Yeah, I'm here to say we can't do that because we understand the overall plan here.  That would just collapse the plan.  I don't know.  Delicate balance.  I would hope that they would at least listen to the suggestion of maybe running a best of 
[03:19:30]  or the first hour of the show or something, just so we know six to ten is ours.  Hey, I've got to suggest.  But as far as doing another hour, that's just not going to happen.  I've got a suggestion.  What?  What?  What?  Danny better do for an hour, man.  Who wouldn't listen to see if he's going to kill someone?  I like Danny.  Call that one.  I like him a lot.  No, he's good.  What's wrong?  All right.  What's wrong?  Seem to have Robert Federer's home phone number.  Oh, good.  We'll call him at home.  Get that motherfucker at home.  We'll call him at home.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  Thank you, Candyman.  All right.  Later.  They know why.  This person knows why they picked Atlanta Hospital.  Bobby in Georgia.  Bobby.  Some information you got, man.  What's going on?  I love that guy.  What's up, Bobby?  Hey, listen.  What they did was in the paper, they had the statistic.  Every seven seconds, a baby was born.  Every 13 seconds, somebody died.  And every 31 seconds, an illegal immigrant comes into the country.  Or an immigrant is naturalized or whatever.  But anyway, they figured, with all the babies going on in Atlanta, they figured that's the  busiest place. 
[03:20:30]  So that's where they figured.  They sit there and count it back, and they look at it, and they just figured that's where  the baby would get.  Well, they missed it.  You know what sucks is some poor mom somewhere that officially had the 300th, 300 millionth  kid.  Yeah, it's hard to say.  300 millionth, 300 millionth kid.  And no one knows.  But God knows.  God knows who's 300 millionth.  Oh, God doesn't give a fat rat's ass.  And you tell Robert Fetter, whatever the hell he wants to call himself, that he better 
[03:21:00]  come on the air with us, or some of these credit card numbers will be distributed amongst  our crew.  They have his credit card numbers?  They don't know what they got.  The pests are very resourceful.  Wow.  Vote for Jerry Springer tonight, pass.  Jesus Christ.  Let's get the job done.  There was blood type.  Let's get the job done.  Don't you worry about it.  Here's his blood type.  You want us to throw some AIDS in it?  This bit of information right there is crucial to any theft of identity. 
[03:21:30]  Can you say what kind of a...  Right there.  No, I'm not going to say a word.  But right there.  That is crucial.  Oh, my.  No, you tell him to just fucking get on the phone.  Look at this.  Look at that.  Where is it?  You get that information.  Hey, this guy gets it.  What is it?  Let me see.  It's probably the wrong fucking one.  This guy gets it.  No, that's him.  Look at that.  Where am I looking at?  Okay.  Right here. 
[03:22:00]  Right there.  Oh, over there.  Yeah.  Look at that.  No.  Wiggle it out over the air.  Oh, no.  Isn't that great?  Oh, no.  That's hysterical.  Very resourceful.  All right, let's see.  Not picking up.  Can we leave a message?  Let's leave a message.  Let's leave a message.  Can we leave a message?  All right, not picking up.  Eight.  We'll give away.  Every time we call and you don't answer, another number gets given out.  Eight.  Let's leave a message.  Is the first number.  Well, he might be on his way to work.  Of the area code. 
[03:22:30]  Let's be realistic.  It's not realistic.  Why should we start now?  He may be on his way to work.  He may not be avoiding it.  He may not have heard this.  He may not have XM.  He may not be unaware right now.  Well, now it's...  What if he stops at a glory hole?  Well, then, I'm sure.  It's 9-15 now.  Schedules that in.  Call the Sun-Times.  Chicago Sun-Times.  Like we used to say, get him on the horn.  Tell him that Opie and Anthony are having a meltdown and they need to talk to Robert.  Whatever. 
[03:23:00]  Tony in Pennsylvania.  Tony.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Listen, I got to call you guys.  You know, I'm a long-time fan.  Yeah.  On the old show.  Yeah.  When there was problems like this, you guys at least dealt with it.  All you're doing is looking for excuses now.  And it's, you know...  What do you mean?  Let's talk about it.  All right.  Please explain.  You can't just throw that out.  Well, I mean, you know, you're not looking for any solutions.  Instead of coming up with good bits.  I mean, right now, you guys should be plugging the fact that your replay, Letterman, will be tonight.  We have been.  We have been.  Yeah, and little Jimmy will be on November 1st. 
[03:23:30]  He's trying to make us feel better by doing a little gag call.  Sasha has a problem with you.  Sasha.  Sasha, what's the matter?  Hey, man.  Anthony, you there, man?  This guy is so not from...  Yes.  Okay.  I'll play along.  Yes.  I'm here, Sasha.  Thank you for playing along, man.  Hey, dude.  You say you're hating on Seattle, man, but we love you up here, man. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, I love the Northwest.  What I really meant was the Southwest.  Hold on, man.  I get it confused.  It's a cappuccino.  Hold on, man.  Hold on, man.  He's having his cappuccino.  It's wacky Pacific Northwest guy.  That's right.  Except I hate it when you really hate on the women, man, because the women are our sisters.  They're our mothers, man.  And I'm not dealt with that either.  God, this guy does sound like people from there.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  All right. 
[03:24:30]  Well, we got someone at Free FM that has heard us.  Open Anthony, Free FM, New York City, 6 to 9 a.m.  They did the breakout.  Oh, finally?  Men 18 at 34.  Ranked number three.  Really?  Overall, number two English with a 7.8.  Number two English, yeah.  Trailing only a hot 97 and some Spanish douche station.  So wait, for the white station, we're the number one in that demo? 
[03:25:00]  Number two for whitey?  You know what?  Number three overall.  Yeah, that's fine.  But you got to take the Spanish crap out because you can't compete with Spanish.  Because there's too many Spanish people going over.  And there's only a few stations.  There's only, yeah, a couple of stations and there's a hell of a lot of Spaniards.  Well, this is how they sell it to the advertisers.  This isn't us trying to make ourselves look better.  We actually sell it this way.  Because on the Spanish station, they play Spanish commercials.  So they could go to advertisers and go, good news.  You know, Open Anthony, men 18 to 34 are the number two English speaking radio show in morning drive. 
[03:25:30]  Men 18 to 49, the story's even better.  We're ranked number two when you get rid of that crap hour.  And we are number one as far as English speaking radio stations.  Are they promoting it as the crap hour?  Is that what they actually call it?  Yeah, it's the crap hour.  Wait, number one, what was that demo you just read?  Men 18 to 49, that's our demo.  18 to 49's our demo.  So we're second behind the Spanish speaking station, basically. 
[03:26:00]  Okay.  That is huge.  Number one English.  Men 25 to 49, you know, we're ranked number two behind the Spanish speaking station.  Number one English speaking radio show.  And it just goes on.  Number two overall, men 25 to 44, same thing.  Spanish station beating us.  Men 25 to 54 were ranked third overall.  You can't say you said that?  Number two English.  They're just praising us, though.  Wins is beating us. 
[03:26:30]  Men 25 to 54.  Damn news.  They're fucking assholes that win.  I hate that little news clicker.  The paper reporting a 2-2 overall 12 plus.  Right.  What did I tell you we had?  I just wanted to show my...  I think you said a 2-5.  Is that correct?  I forget.  I actually went with a .4.  So I said to him earlier, 2-6.  Okay.  He's got 2-6 as well.  2-6.  If you see that article in Daily News today, moves us all the way past all those stations  that were tied at 2-5, including IMIS, including Q104 here in New York. 
[03:27:00]  It's a whole different story when you get rid of the crap hours, what we're getting at.  I'm going to send this off to someone.  Oh, boy.  Look what I do.  What are you doing?  Look.  Look what I do.  Oh, no.  Look what I do.  Look.  I'm starting trouble.  Look.  Look.  Look.  I see what you do.  What's my Tyson audio?  You might want to take a look at this.  Send.  There you go.  That'll be it.  That'll be on a website in the very near future. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Great.  Whoa.  What happened?  Did I just do something?  Oh, and the guy that I just sent it to?  Yeah.  Just emailed you?  I said, can you forward New York waiting to me?  I just sucked that bottle.  I beat him to the punch.  He wanted him.  I sent him.  All right.  Jiminy Cricket.  There you go.  Heart.  They consider Hot 97 English speaking?  Good point. 
[03:28:00]  Good point.  They speak the language of the swiggy.  No.  Oh, they're very popular.  Yeah.  And they bitch because I say pounds instead of dollars.  Really?  You might want to listen to Hot 97.  What?  All right.  What do you want to do?  I want to hear John Mark Carr audio.  John Mark Carr.  And Mike Tyson?  Yes.  All right.  We'll do that after the break.  I say Tyson first.  That's just my guess.  It's not necessary.  Oh, I don't know. 
[03:28:30]  What do you think?  Oh, I don't.  You know, I wouldn't mind hearing John Mark Carr throat.  And I do see a point for the other.  Um, I think that I should have, I don't know. 
[03:29:00]  I'm going to say maybe we should do.  Oh, I don't know. 
[03:29:30]  It's a freak shot.  Sturdy little spank.  Oh, yeah.  This tastes so good.  Come on down and I'll feed you a sausage.  Give me it.  Oh, no.  You guys suck.  So does your mom.  You guys suck. 
[03:30:00]  So does your mom.  I'm quite the mother.  The mother shucker.  The mother shucker.  But friggin' what?  Talk about things.  Talk about things.  Food syndication.  Talk about things.  Talk me, bitch.  Remember to always drink your banana juice. 
[03:30:30]  Ant's losing his mind.  He's bouncing people from the pal talk room.  Hey, uh, this is the Opie and Anthony show.  I found Sophie.  By the way, I want to say hi to everybody that I personally met at FH Riley's over the weekend.  My brother's restaurant.  My restaurant as well, by the way.  I just don't do anything.  I just sit there. 
[03:31:00]  Silent partner.  Silent partner.  Is that what they call it?  I'm very proud of my brother, though.  He's doing a great job with FH Riley's.  400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village out there on Long Island.  And, uh, they held a last pest standing at FH Riley's over the weekend.  My brother was the emcee.  He's never emceed anything in his life.  That was a rip, man.  Every once in a while he'll get up at a wedding and say something as a best man.  But that's about it.  He doesn't do that.  He doesn't do public speaking or any of that crap.  And I gotta tell you, he did a great job.  He did a great job. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, great emcee.  And, uh, the object was, uh, stand-up comedy.  Like, open mic.  You showed up, man, you went?  Oh, yeah.  Cool.  Oh, my God.  If these guys don't have an appreciation, a newfound appreciation for what you guys do,  uh, they should all just be smacked.  Why was it, uh...  It was hysterical.  In every way it wasn't supposed to be.  Who went up that was funnier than you thought they would be? 
[03:32:00]  Um, um...  My brother.  Your brother.  Yeah, to be honest with you.  Uh...  Whack Baguette.  Whack Baguette.  Who's that?  She was, uh...  Whatever.  She's a girl.  Okay.  She went up first and, uh, really just laid into the, uh, Whack Bag crowd.  Okay.  By the way...  Did some good ripping apart.  Before we move on, don't, don't say who won.  No.  I mean, uh, the insiders, no.  Yeah.  But I'll tell you why I don't want, uh, us to announce the winner.  Because we're thinking of airing Last Pass Standing on 202 in its entirety with no edits. 
[03:32:30]  How long was it?  Just very raw and let it roll.  It's like an hour and a half.  Because they did about 45, 50 minutes and they took a really long break, which was the problem.  If they're going to do this again, they need a shorter break because everyone got hammered.  So the second half is very sloppy.  How's the audio?  It's great.  It's, uh, MP3.  It's perfect.  So we're thinking just run it as a special on this channel.  I got to get with Eric Logan.  We got to get with Eric Logan and Don and decide when we should air it. 
[03:33:00]  Like air it twice.  Maybe this weekend.  In the middle of the night or at whatever.  I'd like to hear it.  Or late night.  What do you think?  I'd love to hear it.  And like I said, the insiders know who won.  But for the casual listener that doesn't go to the websites, they don't consider themselves a pest.  It'll be fun listening for them as well.  I don't know who won.  Right.  That's why I kind of stopped there because I think we're heading in that direction.  We were going to start talking about who was really good and who wasn't and who won the thing.  You know, eventually.  Me and Luis Suke were talking one time.  He said he likes to listen to the comedy channel, but not for good comedy, for bad comedy. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  There's something about hearing horrid comedy.  And I don't mean a really good comic who you just don't like politically or whatever, but somebody who stinks at it.  There's something great about listening to that.  Yeah, absolutely.  Because it's so obvious that they're bad at it.  It's like someone trying to hit a high note and their voice cracking.  Like when someone sucks at doing stand-up, there's just no way around it.  I couldn't get enough of this.  I sat in the back and I was laughing.  I was cringing.  It was all the emotions.  There were definitely some really funny lines.  There were definitely some major cringe moments. 
[03:34:00]  There were just train wrecks.  Oh, yeah.  You know, people just getting yelled at.  Did anybody bomb?  Oh, yeah.  There's bombing.  Oh, it was just complete carpet bombing.  Right.  People that really didn't know might have actually had something that might have been considered an okay joke, but just no timing, no delivery.  Yeah, so.  Did no filter plug on?  Does anybody remember?  Not when I was up there. 
[03:34:30]  Wow.  No, I don't think so.  Why wouldn't he go on stage?  I don't know.  So, we're thinking about it.  I got to get, we got to get with Don and Eric and see when we can run in, where it makes sense.  But I think it would be great for the channel.  You know, I'll intro some of the segments.  Anne can intro.  Yeah.  Just do the setups because it needs some setups here and there.  And just let it run in its entirety.  We were thinking of editing the thing, make it, you know, move a little better.  Yeah.  And then Anne and I are talking like, you know what?  Just run it as is.  Did Happy typing go go on?  She was running the Paltalk camera. 
[03:35:00]  She's a fucking crazy person with her laptop.  She's passionate about the show.  She's a cyborg.  She walks around with the laptop pointing cameras at people.  Yeah.  She's going to catch a murder on film one day, or me masturbating looking at her, and she's  going to go say, cut it out, you.  She'll say, oh, I always knew it.  Oh, I don't think you should be doing that.  I always knew it.  Oh, I don't think so, Jim.  F-E-D-E-R at SunTimes.com.  Attack.  Where is he?  F-E-D-E-R at SunTimes.com. 
[03:35:30]  Attack.  Jerk.  He doesn't want to come on the show with us, well.  Well, have we got to call him again?  He doesn't want to.  Call his house.  Call his place of business.  Let's leave him a message.  Let's leave him an honest message.  Not a nasty one, but just like a, hey, how are you?  Wanted to see if man, well, you know.  Four.  Four.  Oh, you must be playing golf.  All right, psycho.  Are you a golfer?  You could have just said four.  All right, let's have some audio.  Let's play some, let's get with the Mike Tyson. 
[03:36:00]  I'd love to hear Mike Tyson.  All right, we got Mike Tyson.  The other thing.  I just don't want to poke fun.  Vote for Jerry tonight, please.  ONA Pest, this is going to be a tough week.  This could be the week where we lose the whole thing.  Really?  Why?  Eh, this is what?  Have you been kind of keeping tabs?  They talk about the.  Good dancers?  They talk about dancing with the stars on all the gossip shows.  Yeah.  I mean, it's the hot story, so.  And we're kind of controlling it right now.  But I think, I think we got our work cut out for us this week.  Yeah.  So we need everyone to vote for Jerry at abc.com. 
[03:36:30]  Jerry Springer.  Okay.  Mike Tyson wants to beat up girls.  He has in the past, but he wants to get paid for it now and keep it on the legal side.  God, who doesn't?  Mike Tyson said fans should not expect much of a fight when he steps back into the ring.  But the 40-year-old former heavyweight champ promised an entertaining show Friday night  when he launches the Mike Tyson's World Tour in Youngstown, Ohio.  Tyson says he will likely go just four rounds against former sparring partner Corey T. Rex Sanders.  He says future stops on the tour might include bouts with women, possibly professional boxer and wolf. 
[03:37:00]  A promoter for wolf says, ah, that'll never happen.  Fred from Jersey, were you just listening?  What the hell is going on with you two?  Ratings are poor at best.  We just told you what the ratings are.  Oh, my God.  And the email I got will throw it up on whack bag.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus, Lord.  And baby Jesus.  Will you at least listen?  That's your job.  Just listen.  It's somebody who just doesn't understand. 
[03:37:30]  Fred sounds like a real galoot.  You know what happens, too?  They're ignorant of ratings, so they read the paper and see the station ratings  and assume that they are your ratings.  What does Fred know?  Fred takes the shitter.  Fred knows nothing.  Fred likes his shitter-filled.  Fred's not happy unless his shitter is being filled full of potentially damaging fluid.  That's the only time Fred has a smile on his face. 
[03:38:00]  When his vertical smile is being hammered.  Yeah.  His shitter.  When Fred's shitter is being filled with spermatozoa,  it is only then that his frown is turned upside down.  All right.  There's the Tyson audio.  When Fred's shitter looks like a cup of tapioca,  only then is he happy.  When Fred coughs and semen goes blah, blah, blah, and bubbles out of his shitter, 
[03:38:30]  it is then that he's in utopia.  What did we learn from the Tyson audio, anything?  That was no Tyson.  I thought it was going to be Mike Tyson talking.  Oh, no.  I thought, too.  We didn't have that.  Tyson probably just said something like,  yeah, I want to fight this one and that one.  All right.  He wants to fight the bitches.  Yeah.  But what the fuck was, uh,  what's he doing when he's fighting his sparring part?  He doesn't think he's going to last more than four rounds?  He's not the same Tyson.  Oh, of course not.  But, I mean, does Tyson think he's going to get his ass kicked?  You don't even realize he's not the same Tyson. 
[03:39:00]  Of course.  He quit the fucking fight.  He quit his fighting game in the middle of a fight.  Didn't you say that, what, last week, that we're all hoping, was it you?  It's an odd, yes, it's like an odd hope.  We're all hoping that the old Tyson gets back and, you know,  time's a bitch and it's never going to happen.  It's not even hope because we know it's not going to happen.  It's this weird...  He gave up.  It's an unspoken...  We don't really formulate what it is we want from him.  Look at these savages just beating the crap at each other at the Orange Bowl.  I love that clip. 
[03:39:30]  It's great.  It's a great clip.  That was the Tyson audio?  That's...  Fuck.  I know.  I was waiting for that.  I want to hear a girl.  I love hearing Tyson talk, I know.  Well, let's try to get some Tyson audio of him talking about it.  How about John Carr?  Yeah, let's go to John Carr.  Get some John Carr.  Let's talk about John Mark Carr.  What do you say?  What do you say, Dan?  Some John Mark Carr?  Here's John Mark Carr on Larry King Live last night.  What took you to Thailand?  Well, I'd been traveling for a few years outside the United States.  You were a teacher, right? 
[03:40:00]  Yes.  I was a second grade teacher.  I was beginning my one-year contract at a very prestigious international school in Bangkok.  I won't mention the name out of respect for the school.  Have you ever had any problems with children?  No.  Absolutely not.  All those stories were false.  There's so much, Larry, that was false.  That you can tell me.  You never had a problem.  So much.  So much that's false.  You never bothered a child with them?  No.  Bothered.  Absolutely not.  I've protected children.  I've been...  You ever give a kid garlic up the ass? 
[03:40:30]  I've been a teacher for a kid.  You ever make it look like it's assholes leaking Welch's grape juice?  You never bothered a child.  Bothered.  Well, is that what you call...  Yeah.  Is that what you call fucking anal rape?  Excuse me, son.  Why are you having 30 stitches put into your anus?  I was pestered.  The man pestered me.  He was burdensome.  Uncle Johnny bothered me.  He was bothering me. 
[03:41:00]  Is that what you call removing memories?  A mere bother?  Are you never bothered, children?  When someone taps you on the shoulder, that's a bother.  Yeah.  When they put your terrified face into a pillow and make your hiney feel like the sun is being  put into it.  Yeah.  Playing keep away.  That's bothering a kid.  Yes.  Not...  Not...  Yeah.  Shoving your dick in his face.  Yeah.  Making him kiss it.  You bothersome. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  By the way, Chester's liver from Wackbag.  Yes.  John Markar is a fruit.  Fruit.  He is a fruit.  I've been a teacher for...  This is my 10th year of teaching.  I still call myself a teacher.  I've heard that some people say, well, he'll never teach again.  In the profession of teaching, once you're a teacher, you're always a teacher.  If I'm never in a classroom again, I'll always be a teacher.  And I've...  So therefore, you unequivocally say you have never harmed a child and wouldn't because you're 
[03:42:00]  a teacher ever harm a child.  Right.  Not right.  Not right.  How about molest, Larry?  Yeah.  How about use the word sexually or the way you'd say it, sexually mollest?  Mollest.  John Carr is a psychopath and he doesn't think that fucking a kid is bothering you.  Because a lot of pedophiles, look, they really do love children.  Some of them are sadists.  Other ones don't want to hurt kids.  They truly love children.  They want a relationship with them.  They think that it's okay what they're doing because they love kids. 
[03:42:30]  I mean, we really...  They think that the fact that they love children is...  It's the same bit twice when they're going to laugh.  The molest crew.  Check it.  The motley underwear.  Do you ever put blood on a Superman symbol in someone's underoos?  Do you ever bother someone?  Do you ever bother?  Do you ever bother a boy in the way of ripping off his Flash Gordon shirt and biting him? 
[03:43:00]  Were you ever slightly annoying to a child?  By lopping his head off with a little baseball hat on it?  What a fucking idiot, Larry.  I don't want to be a teacher.  Why don't you say the words sexually abused or have you ever molested?  Use words that are undebatable.  Yeah.  Because this guy, if he said you ever bother a child, he's probably going to say no because  they love me and I love them.  It was in a loving relationship.  You'd never harm a child.  No, I love children. 
[03:43:30]  I would only make them feel good.  Yeah.  Well, here we go.  Listen to this one.  So then the obvious question is, you don't have to answer it is, why did you say you did?  This has something to do with a past arrest and a past criminal investigation that was  launched against me.  And I cannot make any kind of comments about that under advisement of my attorney.  Let's set it straight.  Are you saying you never said you harmed a child?  I'm saying that I believe that you're leading into an area that...  No, but it's simple, John. 
[03:44:00]  You either said I did or said I didn't.  I'm not asking about it.  I am saying that I've never harmed a child.  Okay.  I'm saying it right now.  Okay.  I'm saying that I would protect any child who I thought was being harmed.  Okay.  I don't ever recall saying that I did harm you.  Why the fuck is he on this show?  If he's not going to talk about it, why is he on the show?  What about the JonBenet Ramsey thing where he said he was there?  Why did you say that?  Laris, you just keep asking that and then throw him off the show.  Why did you say you were with JonBenet when she died?  I can't under-invite.  Get out.  Get the fuck out. 
[03:44:30]  You're a pedophile.  Beat it.  You creep.  Just keep pushing the guy.  What do you mean your fucking attorney advised you?  Where was he in Thailand when you were sashaying along like one of the aliens?  William Frawley pants.  Yeah.  What a douche this guy is.  And Larry, too.  Larry's a fucking softball lobber.  Ugh.  Ugh.  So you're saying, wow, you're really digging deep.  Yeah.  Well, this next clip's going to really bother you, then.  In all fairness, though, Jon, you don't have to comment. 
[03:45:00]  Why does he keep saying you don't have to comment?  In all fairness, and believe me, just don't talk.  It's a talk show.  Maybe you'll trick him into saying something.  You don't have to comment.  So you just say you don't have to comment.  You know, the person that's in the hot seat gets a little relieved.  Don't say that.  Maybe Larry thinks it puts them at ease.  Larry's a fucking suspender-wearing douche.  The hot seat to him is the seat they use for timeout.  Because it's, ugh.  So hot.  You're in trouble.  You've been a bad girl. 
[03:45:30]  Well, the hot seat is what a lad has after Mr. Cart disciplines him.  Fucking creep this guy is.  Yay.  And fucking Larry's interviewing him like he just wrote a bestseller.  Yeah.  Like he's a nice guy.  You don't have to answer this.  I don't mean to pry, but did you or did you not smother and murder the child with a garret?  Fucking jackass.  What did you do with the little cowboy hat?  Did you wear it and prance around? 
[03:46:00]  Put it on.  Yelling yippee-yay.  Did you fire the little six-guns like, pa-choo, pa-choo?  Pa-choo, pa-choo.  Doddering old fool.  Asinine questions.  In all fairness, though, John, and you don't have to comment,  there were many reports that you did confess to a crime.  Which is what caused the whole hoopla in the beginning.  Oh, crying.  That's why there were all the photographers.  That's why there was the insanity of the plane trip. 
[03:46:30]  You had said you did something.  If you hadn't said you did something, you, don't you think you created the story?  Well, I think that I have multiple opinions on who created the story.  You were part of it.  You know, the story.  That was certainly something that still disgusts me.  I want to be John Mark Carr, the unknown.  You know, I want to be able to walk down the street without anyone knowing who's right now.  You said it on camera. 
[03:47:00]  You're too bright not to know something that's cause and effect.  Well, you know, again, this goes back to what I'm telling you,  that my attorneys have advised me not to.  There's no charges pending against you?  No charges pending against me, but it's not something that I can discuss without my attorney giving me advice to discuss that or being with me.  And at this time, I'm being told by my attorney and advised that I shouldn't discuss this matter. 
[03:47:30]  Not to mention John Benet Ramsey's name.  You know, at this point, I'm possibly a target for law enforcement to just keep their eye on me.  Oh, perish the thought.  Let's keep an eye on a fucking guy that said that he was with a girl when she died.  And I had kiddie porn on his computer that they lost his evidence in California,  and that's the only reason he walked from that fucking case.  And he's just a creep in Thailand.  Why doesn't fucking Larry just say, why did you say I was with John Benet Ramsey when she died? 
[03:48:00]  And then show the clip.  Larry, I know you know I asked you not to mention that name or those allegations.  Why doesn't he just fucking sandbag this cocksucker and play that clip?  Play the clip.  I don't get it.  I'm being nice.  I'm trying to get better guests.  They said if I got him, I'd get Tom Hanks.  Roland told me.  Roland said.  Roland said, if I talk to John Mark Carr, I'd be able to get honest tool. 
[03:48:30]  So, John Mark Carr, you have an eight-year-old opening wide Friday.  Who?  Fucking guys.  What a waste of time.  Larry King's an ass.  Just lobbing softballs at this fucking pedophile who really likes softballs.  He certainly does.  Drunk Mexican from Virginia.  Is Jimmy upset because Carr is a sicko or that he isn't handing out pointers?  I don't like... 
[03:49:00]  And DJ Anal Lightbulb from posthores.net as Larry King, I don't mean to be uncouth, but did you shove your hog in a toddler?  That's exactly what he should be asking him.  You don't have to answer.  He's a real journalist, and that fuck, he's letting that coward hide behind his lawyer, which this actually just makes John Carr look more like a fucking creep than he already did.  I was with her when she died.  Why did you say that?  Did you lap hairless twat?  You don't have to answer.  Just wink.  Me, you, Betsy, a toddler. 
[03:49:30]  What a creep.  Did you open her little pussy because you thought there was a pearl in it because it looked like a little oyster?  Were you pearl hunting?  I think he was just smart and wanted to get out of Taiwan.  You were helping little boys make wee-wee.  Were you?  Was that what you did?  Were you really kissing her little vagina like it was a Muppet mouth? 
[03:50:00]  Ah, shit.  Let's get out of here.  Line up the date.  Now, you don't have to answer this, but when you left that home, does your penis smell like blood and Similac?  You don't have to answer if you're attorney-invite not to.  Fucking the Motley Crue.  But I need to know.  I had to cut his throat and watch just dust fall out of it.  He's fucking finished and irrelevant, Larry King.  Fucking suspenders-weary idiot. 
[03:50:30]  How about a real question?  You're a fucking journalist.  He gave him nothing.  He fucking didn't guess what we asked fucking Brian Cox tougher questions over at CBS.  Holy shit.  Nothing.  Line of the day time.  Line of the day.  Sponsored by BodogFight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S. in a bout against the Russians.  It's all on BodogFight.com, a mixed martial arts tournament and docu-reality unlike any seen before. 
[03:51:00]  Here is today's runner-up line of the day.  You don't come into the Orange Bowl, baby.  We've had a down couple of years, but you don't come in here talking trash.  The OB.  He called it the OB.  That's the Orange Bowl.  Yeah, the Orange Bowl.  The OB.  What a DB he is.  Everything sounds tough when you call it that.  S-N. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  And then they proceeded to laugh for about two straight minutes.  Yeah, I know.  Just giggling.  That's funny because we know what he meant.  Yeah.  Here we go.  This is the line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  All you remember is some kind of sour breath over your shoulder, and like, as the pain 
[03:52:00]  got really intense, you heard a grunt, and then a hat fell off the head and landed in  front of you.  As he gave that final thrust, he went, and he just, his hat fell off, and landed in front  of the lad.  Mama, the man's hat fell off, and then my hiney exploded.  There you go. 
[03:52:30]  He left the harder the second time.  The funny part to me in that whole thing is not only the fact that he has on a burgundy  felt outfit, but after he thrusts and the kid is unhappy, and the hat thuds, like, clinks  off in paper hat fashion, if you were watching from the back, all you'd see is him bent over  grunting with hat head.  He'd have crown head.  Sweaty hat head with that hat, just kind of, the winds kind of making him move a little 
[03:53:00]  on the counter.  No, it's not the winds.  It's the wispy breaths of the confused victim.  Line of the day within line of the day.  Plink.  Let's go to Todd in West Virginia. 
[03:53:30]  Todd.  Plink.  Yeah.  Yeah, Todd.  Hey, how you doing?  I hope you, John Mark Carr was in Thailand, not Taiwan.  Yeah, I know.  Oh.  Yeah, same shit.  Here's the sound it would make when it fell off, too.  You hear, ah!  A little paper hat just hitting the counter.  What is wrong with you? 
[03:54:00]  Communique still no fetter or feeder have been trying him regularly.  Fit the air.  All right.  Oh, I gotta shit and go do fucking DVD commentary for Locky Lloyd. 
[03:54:30]  Oh!  Another guy that cares what I look like, Sir Loggins.  Wow.  I guess he sent this about, uh, one, two, a ton of times.  Got a problem?  Well, he writes, uh, I love when Opie says, you know, I could have been a model, but they  leave off the, on the cover of Mongoloid Fancy at the end.  Oh, Mongoloid Fancy.  Wow.  I'm a subscriber to that, by the way.  Yes.  Sir, why?  Sir Loggins, why?  Why? 
[03:55:00]  You thought that line was that good?  It's that good.  You watching this shit?  What?  They just pulled a dinosaur out of the water and you don't even fucking react.  Shut up.  That's my script.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Oh!  Wow.  Look at that.  That was good.  I didn't know you were acting.  You were picking your teeth with your hand.  That was good.  All right.  Good luck with your audition.  Yes.  You know what I want to do with this banana? 
[03:55:30]  What?  What are you going to do with it?  I want to rub it over someone's face and make this noise.  We're getting silly.  We're leaving.  We're leaving before we go into silly mode.  I'm sorry.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye.  Bye.  Anthony and I are a show without a station.  We're floating.  We really don't have a home.  A place we can call our own.  Yeah, well, that's the way it's always been.  You and I, the outcasts of radio.  I don't understand.  No one wants us.  What the hell is going on?  No one truly wants us.  No.  No one truly wants our radio show. 
[03:56:00]  But much to their chagrin, we're doing a little too well to just set a drift.  Tune in tomorrow for another chapter in the heart-wrenching saga that is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Bye-bye.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.  If you'd like to vote on any of the weekly show polls, go to iliketolisten.com. </pre>
