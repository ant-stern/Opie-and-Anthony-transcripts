<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the in-studio appearance of Joe and Anthony from the band Rotgut.  Rotgut performed several original songs throughout the broadcast, including satirical numbers about Cuban refugees and the White House plane crasher, as well as a reggae parody of *The Brady Bunch*.  Comedian Sam Kinison was also a guest on the show.

Opie introduced a new segment, "Celebrity Death Watch,"  centered around the theory of celebrities dying in threes.  He referenced the recent death of Jessica Tandy and speculated about who the next two victims might be, with a discussion ensuing on whether Patrick O'Neill's death qualified under the segment's criteria of "prominent" celebrity.

The show continued with various segments including a live performance of Rotgut's song "Gun Electric Shock OJ."  Listeners also called in, with one woman claiming breast growth after a hypnosis session, and another caller requesting Opie to physically assault his future wife on air.

A significant portion of the broadcast involved an in-studio appearance by a BDSM couple, "Master Spike" and his "slave," who engaged in a spanking and hot wax session live on the air.  Remarkably, a pizza delivery person, who arrived earlier in the show, remained throughout this and the other segments.  The show concluded with Rotgut promoting an upcoming performance.

[00:22:30]  Yeah  Because if you're like me  You have noticed  That celebrities die in threes  Always  I bet the farm on George Burns  Now he keeps coming back  He had brain swelling on Tuesday  He's 98  Fell in his bathtub  My brain is swelling  And supposedly  He's gonna be alright  Of course  So let's go over this real fast  Jessica Taney died Monday  She's one  And I predict  Within the next two weeks  Two more prominent celebrities  Will, you know, keel over  And we just got a ruling 
[00:23:00]  That Patrick O'Neill  He was in Stepford Wives  Right  Which is a sick movie  But he wasn't prominent enough  Didn't do much after that  So still  It's only one celebrity has died  That is  So we're still looking for two more  Any suggestions possibly?  We were thinking before  Ray Combs  The old host of Family Feud  The one  Wait, wait  The new old host  Right  Because Richard Dawson  Right, right, right  Was the host  Okay  Then they had Ray Combs  He had a horrible accident  Right  And now he's been in  Some kind of near death coma  For months  Like a long time 
[00:23:30]  Almost a year  So he would definitely  So they brought back  Richard Dawson  For the feud  Have you seen him?  He's most bloated  Right  Graying  He looks horrendous  Come over here, honey  Suck my face  Let's give Richard a little kiss  Know who he reminds me of?  Oh  Dudley Moore  All the way  Where the hell's my hat?  Hi, Linda  Excuse me  Oh, your head

[00:32:30]  Can she bend over so we can see the brand on her?  On her brand?  Sure.  You actually branded your wife.  Take this right off.  Oh, my God.  Look at that butt.  The love.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  I want to see the brand.  Don't lose your footing.  Don't lose your footing.  All right.  Very good.  That's a couple quick spanks.  Yes.  Let's warm it up.  And you brought all sorts of sex toys.  Let's hear the whip.  They're discipline toys.  Discipline.  I called them artillery before I had the artillery.  I want to hear the whip real fast. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, the whip?  Sure.  Everyone, move back.  Hold.  Move over.  Duck.  Ow.  Oh.  Easy.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That's frightening.  I've seen some towel snapping in the locker room, but this is way out of hand.  Do we have security in the building?  Okay.  So, this is all in fun.  I've got to say this right away.  Oh, this is just to have fun.  So, you do bachelor parties, right?  Mm-hmm.  And you did one tonight, and Master Spike's not happy with you. 
[00:33:30]  No.  I'm very, very disappointed about that.  He said I was a dirty little slut.  Oh.  I don't think you can say that.  Okay.  I'll be here all week.  Try the veal.  Thank you, Ray.  No.  All right.  Wait, wait.  Before you discipline her, we're going to play a little whipping post music, I think.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  All right.  So, explain what she did, Master Spike.  Well, we went to this bachelor party tonight, and unfortunately, she went over there, and 
[00:34:00]  she was standing with all her beauty.  I was flashing this older gentleman, and he got really excited, and everyone thought he  was going to have a heart attack.  Not to mention, she was stalked bird naked.  Naked?  Okay.  Okay.  So, what's going to happen now?  Well, she has to get disciplined, because she was taking her flappers right over the  guy as he was laying down, and she was wiggling her torso. 
[00:34:30]  Okay.  Hey, listen.  We got a nice spanking chair for you.  Oh, this chair is just perfect for spanking.  Armless and warmed up.  Yes.  All right.  By the way, this lady is beautiful, man.  Very attractive.  One hair, perfect body, and a leather get-up, tattoos.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute. 
[00:35:00]  What was it?  Does that hurt?  Spike is using the southpaw stance.  And you like this?  Oh.  Yes, she does.  Oh, it's hot.  Does that turn you on, really?  It's like extended foreplay.  Sure.  All right.  Why don't you let Opie pour some hot wax on me?  Yeah.  All right.  Come here, Opie.  Come on, Opie.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me play a couple commercials right after the commercials.  I will do that.  I will do that.  Stay right there.  Ah!  All right, all right.  Enough with the whip already. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Okay.  So, quickly, we've got to do this because we've got to get back in the songs.  What are we doing?  Dripping some wax now?  Yeah, we're going to put some hot wax on her, Opie's going to put some hot wax.  This is how demented the show got tonight.  The guy that delivered the pizza about three hours ago is still hanging out.  I don't even know this guy, but now I do.  She's bent over.  The pizza guy.  Her lovely round ass is right in front of me.  You have to help me with my ultimate fantasy.  You really want me to drip this wax on you? 
[00:36:00]  It's really lovely.  Wait, what's the ultimate fantasy?  All right, here we go.  It's an Asian girl.  Here we go.  It's purple wax.  Do you want an Asian girl?  Here it is.  Uh-oh.  Here it comes.  Very nice.  Oh!  Try and make an X, Opie.  That doesn't hurt.  Oh!  Oh, it's hot.  I just dripped my initials in her butt.  Yeah, it's Opie.  Look at that.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Sorry, my handwriting is pretty sloppy, but there you go.  All right.  I want to thank Master Spike and his slave for stopping on by the nighttime attitude where 
[00:36:30]  you never know who's going to...  Enough with the whip already, all right?  We're just about wrapping up the nighttime attitude.  We got a lot of people to thank tonight.  I want to thank TJ and Bobby for producing the show tonight.  I want to thank Mickey J from Montauk and his mission of Good Times, Bad Times.  We want to thank all the people off the radio after we abused Kurt Cobain.  They were part of the show.  Thank you. 
[00:37:00]  Who else we want to thank?  Oh, the pizza dude who decided to stay for three, four hours.  He's driving right now going, that's me.  That's me.  We want to thank Master Spike and his slave.  If you're just turning on the radio, it's going to take way too long to explain.  Unbelievable.  I'm going to be able to explain it.  I want to thank Nicky G for stopping by.  Who else?  I just make the album.  Oh, you guys.  Oh, yeah.  I feel so at home here.  I had to thank somebody.  I want to thank Rod Cut.  Where are you guys going to be next? 
[00:37:30]  We're going to be at, on the 23rd, we're doing a show at Hofstra at the USA.  That's the on-campus club over at Hofstra University.  University.  In Hofstra University. </pre>
