<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the usual chaotic banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, filled with offensive jokes about communism, pedophilia, and the show's unpopularity.  A significant portion focused on a listener who switched to XM radio specifically to avoid them, prompting further vulgar jokes and discussions about sex.  A lengthy, absurd segment followed concerning a pedometer given to staff member Ben, with a caller, Scott, providing a technical explanation of its mechanics.

The show then shifted to a critique of "Supersize Me," speculating on the filmmaker's motives, followed by a McDonald's discussion. This transitioned into an analysis of their past interview with Alex Borstein, acknowledging their difficulties interviewing intelligent women. A caller further discussed their low XM ratings, mentioning promotional appearances at the Boston Comedy Club and the Howard Stern show.  A substantial portion then mocked Rosie O'Donnell's movie, "Riding the Bus with My Sister," using derogatory terms and jokes about intellectual disability.  This included reminiscing about past guest Corky (a person with Down syndrome) and playing Stephen Lynch's Special Olympics song.  The segment continued with more jokes about Rosie O'Donnell and intellectual disability.

A later segment heavily criticized Rosie O'Donnell's film,  repeatedly using derogatory language for intellectual disability. Multiple clips were played, with the hosts, callers, and even the actress portraying the character (who spoke about basing her performance on a real person with a similar condition, without meeting that person) engaging in offensive humor and speculation. This segment also included discussions about the hosts' struggles with intelligent women, poor movie quality (especially a planned "Honeymooners" remake with a Black cast), and a song about disability.

Another excerpt involved a discussion of a negative *Kojak* remake, followed by speculation on Tom Cruise's sexuality and a caller's shift from Howard Stern's show, citing Stern's negativity.  The conversation touched upon a Rosie O'Donnell bit,  Stern's vacations, the upcoming *The Honeymoollies* remake, topless photos of Katie Holmes, and George W. Bush's social security speech. This led to darkly humorous comments about euthanasia for the elderly,  the network's preemption of the speech, Randy Rhodes' controversial anti-Bush skit, and a debate on the legality of such satire.  Anthony described his multitasking while playing online poker, including an anecdote about almost defecating during a tournament, leading to a discussion about bathroom habits.  A listener debated social security and politics with the hosts, referencing Michael Moore and Al Franken's *Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them*. The segment concluded with discussion of the Rhodes skit, a positive *Roger & Me* review, a Paisano's ad, Dalton Ross's arrival from *Entertainment Weekly*, and a tease for Ben Bailey.

The interview with Dalton Ross from *Entertainment Weekly* focused on television, including HBO shows (*Deadwood*, *Entourage*, Louis C.K.'s pilot), *American Idol* (with commentary on Paula Abdul and Scott Savold), *Lost*, Rosie O'Donnell's movie, Ellen DeGeneres, and the Britney Spears/Kevin Federline reality show.  The discussion included the frequency of the C-word in *Deadwood*, May Sweeps programming, cancelled shows, and speculation about an *American Idol* contestant's alleged child abuse and drug use.  Dee Dee, a news contributor, called in with stories about children making pornography, frogs in smoothies, nurses consuming marijuana brownies, and further speculation about Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes.  The segment ended with discussion of Dee Dee's weekend plans and sexual activity; various audio clips including *Life on a Stick* and an anal sex commercial were played.

Finally, the broadcast included a call from listener Marion, providing a life update (new job, weight loss, continued affection for the show) and recalling past interactions.  Comedian Lance Kroll then called in, discussing his previous failed appearance with Tracy Morgan, his Taekwondo background, his Spike TV show, and his role as "Kip the Gay Guy" on *The Joe Schmo Show*.  The conversation included tangents on martial arts, Joe Rogan, reality TV, and culminated in a vulgar, self-deprecating pitch from Kroll in character as Chris Walken. The show concluded with thank-yous to Kroll, mentions of gifts from Dr. Steve, and farewell comments to the crew.

[00:03:30]  This moral decay weakens our resistance to the onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  Pedophile humor.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes! Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  El virus.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  No, do it!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  O-N-A party rock! 
[00:04:30]  You're a phony!  Hey!  This guy's a great big phony!  Hey!  You're a great big phony, you know that?  That's right.  You're a big fat phony!  That name sounds like royalty.  Are you royalty?  I'll bet you're the kind of guy that would fuck a person in the ass and not even have the goddamn common service that he gave him a reach around.  Who's the slimy little communist shit-twinkled-toed cocksucker down here who just signed his own death war? 
[00:05:00]  I'm scared of you!  I'm scared of you!  Well, no shit.  I'm scared!  You had best un-fuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and shit down your neck!  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  What are these fucking cards, sweetheart?  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please follow the police.  What have we got here, a fucking comedian? 
[00:05:30]  I am actually considering the satellite radio option.  I'll go to whatever network doesn't have Opium Anthony.  What a dick!  Well, no shit.  That's gonna turn out to be a brilliant decision on your part, you ass.  Isn't that great?  He based his whole decision in life and career on that.  That's pretty much it. 
[00:06:00]  I've never heard him lay out any other criteria for a satellite radio company for him to go to.  I've never heard him lay out anything else but that.  I am actually considering the satellite radio option.  I'll go to whatever network doesn't have Opium Anthony.  Don't pull my fucking hand over there!  I said choke yourself!  Beyond AM, Beyond FM is XM's satellite radio.  Open your mouth!  They're paying for it!  You eat it!  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body. 
[00:06:30]  We can freeze his head.  I know that one didn't make sense, but I just love that clip.  Oh, God.  Welcome to the Opium Anthony show.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Good morning!  Because we made the right decision when it came to picking a satellite radio company.  That's right.  Sirius is in the toilet.  XM is just kicking ass left and right.  Mm-hmm.  Left and fucking right.  We said we'd go to any satellite company that doesn't have Ben Sparks working there. 
[00:07:00]  Sorry, Ant.  Oh, well.  Fucked up your line, but...  What'd you do?  Paper cut.  I hate that.  You ever get one right across the helmet over the hole?  Stop it!  No!  Don't even joke!  I've gotten one of those.  Oh!  Ow!  You ever have a piece of skin...  Think about it.  You ever have a piece of skin on the side of your nail and you decide to pull it off?  And when you're done pulling, you pull it all the way down to your elbow? 
[00:07:30]  You have a little thin red stripe right down to your elbow.  After you pull your cuticle.  Paper cuts.  What were you saying, Ant?  I'm sorry.  I'm not thinking it was ancient mystery.  Look, it totally took me out of the game.  I hate that.  It's a good thing they don't sting for hours.  It's not even that.  It doesn't...  It doesn't really do much damage, but just the feeling as it's happening just skeeves me...  skeeves me out.  Ooh, it's not bad, Travis.  It's such a perfect little opening.  Perfect little wound opening.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a paper cut.  Mmm. 
[00:08:00]  What were you saying about Ben, though?  I said we...  Now you've got a mouth full of food.  Jesus, dude.  I haven't tried.  You had an hour to eat.  You decide...  The mic's...  It just got here and I'm starving.  We sit around for an hour.  Good job, Travis.  Yeah.  We sit around for an hour waiting for the show to start.  We finally get in here.  We have a ridiculous 15 minute open and then finally the mics go on and that's when you  decide to take your first bite.  Yeah.  My God, man.  Actually, I just had to take one bite to see how it was. 
[00:08:30]  Was it good?  He did a good job?  He did a great job.  All right.  As usual.  Can I request that Travis just brings me a fork that he didn't actually hold his thumb over  the mouthpiece on?  Did he do that?  He was holding it by the tines?  He's holding...  Ooh.  Ooh.  Wait.  What was that at?  He was holding it by the fork's tines.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  You know, I think the professor moniker there, if I just...  If anybody knows that they're called tines, I don't think you really need the whole professor 
[00:09:00]  there.  I disagree.  I think a lot of people kind of know that.  I disagree.  Because this whole thing is about how you know a little bit about everything.  Yeah.  Some people have the misconception that I know everything.  It's not true.  I said a little bit about everything.  I know.  Well, a lot of people ask me stuff on the websites and chat rooms or message boards, assuming  I know everything.  He just came in with a big box of forks and just opened up the lid and gave it to him  like, your forks, sir. 
[00:09:30]  I am presenting you a fork, sir.  He is picked whichever one pleases you.  No, that's the beauty of you, though.  You know just a little bit about everything.  Just a tad.  So you could talk to anyone about anything.  Oh.  Because after a while, you know, it gets boring.  Who cares if you know that much about astronomy?  You just want to know the basics.  That's it.  Or whatever.  Name subject here.  Point star or a physicist.  That's right.  Have a little something for everybody.  A little something.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Well, Ben was in the office.  Yes.  God, I love when people just step right into shit.  Step right into the...  He really is crazy.  He really is crazy.  Why?  Why do you think Ben's crazy?  Why is he wearing a...  He's got a pedometer.  Well, that's what came in a care package today.  Oh, it did?  Yeah.  He opened it up.  He was very excited.  I'm like, Ben, what is that?  He goes, I'm going to keep track of how many miles I walk during the day.  During the day. 
[00:10:30]  Because I guess he walks home from work.  Yeah.  And it's a long walk and he wants to kind of time it out.  Is it herky and jerky proof?  I don't know.  That's what we're getting.  Does it have a herky and jerky thing built in so it doesn't count those as steps?  Because he could walk to the moon with all the miles that are going to be on that thing.  He's got it on his shoulder.  I should have walked 40 miles.  So he's keeping track of how far he walks during the show, I guess.  I don't know.  And then he's going to figure out how far it is all the way home. 
[00:11:00]  Where's he clipped the name drop-o-meter?  That one?  A pedometer.  Just make sure he doesn't walk by schoolyards and beeps.  What does that do, dude?  Get up.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  Oh, my God.  I'm not kidding.  Eric is sitting in the seat in front of the night.  I want to sit down.  He hit his shoulder.  He's got a chair over there.  He goes, get up.  Did you just pull a power move?  Get up.  That was his whole power move.  Get up.  That's right. 
[00:11:30]  That was Ben the boss.  Yeah.  I'll work anywhere that Eric doesn't.  That's right.  I'll sit anywhere that Eric doesn't.  I got this so I can see how far I go on my bike and stuff.  Why not?  On your bike?  I was joking about it in the office.  It doesn't work on a bike?  I would assume so, doesn't it?  I'm not joking.  You had it on your side.  I was testing to see if it works.  Steve was sitting in my chair.  What?  It doesn't work on a bike?  I don't think it does.  I think it works.  Here's something I believe.  You might be wrong on this one, by the way.  From what I know, I believe it works from some type of, you know, your steps. 
[00:12:00]  It has to actually have some kind of impact, doesn't it?  I don't know.  How else would it work?  Is it a pendulum thing?  I don't know.  How does it work?  I don't know.  Maybe the bend.  It can't be the steps, because what if your stride is longer than someone else's?  Then it wouldn't be accurate.  Yeah, but I think you have to take that into consideration.  I think you program it or something.  Why don't you throw it on and take a few steps?  Let me take a look.  Let's see, Ben.  Did it come with, like, an instruction manual?  Yeah.  Is it on right now? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  It's moving when I tap the bottom.  Dude, you are not doing what I think you're doing.  I'm pedaling a bicycle.  No, you're not.  Oh, my God.  He's spinning in a circle.  You're spinning it in a circle, and it's actually working.  You're circling around.  It is.  What are you supposed to put it on?  Dude, it is working.  Yeah, but you're making circular motions.  The only way that would work on a bike is if you put that on the actual wheel as it's 
[00:13:00]  going around.  Or you put it on your ankle.  I guess that's where you'd put it if you were...  No, hold it with your other hand.  Now make circles with your other hand.  See, that ain't gonna work.  I know that.  You would have to put this on your ankle if you were riding a bike with it.  Oh, is that what you're thinking?  I'm thinking it's got a pendulum in it.  You can feel it.  Yeah.  You can feel it.  So what does that mean?  It's very sensitive to any kind of movement.  What does the pendulum mean, then?  I don't know.  It just means that it's any type of movement whatsoever and it's chalking up. 
[00:13:30]  Hold on.  Where was this mailed from?  Where was it mailed from?  Yeah.  What do you mean, where was it mailed from?  Where did it come from?  It came from a store.  I don't know.  What do you want me to call it?  It came in a box, though, right?  Right.  From a store in New York City?  Yeah.  Alright, so there should be something on there, then.  That thing traveled.  Oh, no.  I reset it already.  It did.  Yeah, no.  I reset it already.  Was there something on there?  Yeah, there was.  There actually was.  I'm not going to chalk up the miles that it spent in the back of the delivery truck.  Why not? 
[00:14:00]  Look, it was on a bumpy road.  You know.  Not accurate.  Someone has to tell us how this fucking thing works.  Listen.  I hear that.  You hear it?  Let me go to Scott.  Hey, Scott.  It's chalking up all kinds of stuff.  Scott?  Hey.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, how you doing?  It works just like a little round T87 thermostat with a mercury bulb.  T87 thermostat.  Scott's using the language I understand.  Yeah.  A little mercury bulb.  You got it.  But that's how that works.  I've got one.  I walk about 12 miles a day on the job. 
[00:14:30]  Alright.  Thank you.  Alright.  Have a good one.  Alright.  Bye.  The pedometer multiplies the number of steps you take by the stride length.  You enter and then divide that number by 5,280, the number of feet in a mile.  Oh, my God.  This is fascinating.  There you go.  This is the worst radio ever.  This is how we start the Friday show.  Your pedometer.  There we go. 
[00:15:00]  There we go.  Well, we had a quick joke about the herky and jerky in motion and how we were wondering  if that would affect the pedometer.  And we got a little tied up in the mechanics of the whole thing.  Let me also state that when I opened this up, Opie was like, oh, wow, where'd you get  that?  You were kind of like, oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So let's just get that on the table, too.  I was just rollerblading.  That's what I was starting to think.  Why not?  You know.  I'm actually interested.  A little worse when I'm inline skating.  I don't think it would.  No?  I think like on little impact, it would put like a step in there, but you're rolling, 
[00:15:30]  you know?  By the way, the hardcore skaters don't like when you call it rollerblading.  Oh.  Inline skating?  Yeah, because rollerblades is a brand.  Right.  It's like a Xerox.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I didn't know that.  I found out the hard way, because I've been talking about, you know, skating and inline  skating for years, and the hardcore, dude, it's not called rollerblading.  That's a brand.  It's called inline skating.  Great.  Or you could just say skating now. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Because people know you're, you know, on the roads.  They don't skate on those big dopey skates anymore, so it's just skating.  Skate.  Whatever.  We'll keep that in mind.  I'll tell you what.  I'll give you a report on Monday.  How's that?  Very good.  I'll try it out over the weekend.  I saw Supersize Me, and that guy has one of those in there to test how far New Yorkers  walk when he's doing this thing on McDonald's.  Right.  And that's where I thought it made you get it.  That's our old pal, by the way.  He used to do our radio show.  What?  He's coming in, too.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  He's coming in in a couple weeks.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  For MTV.  Yeah.  Ibetyouwill.com.  He was the guy.  And then, remember, he came in and did a bunch of stuff for us, and then he got the  TV show on MTV, and then he got Supersize Me, which is, if you saw that, did you see that?  It was good, yeah.  I didn't love it, but it was good.  It was interesting.  That, to me, was interesting, that thing.  Yeah.  You know, Supersize Me was interesting.  That's right.  That movie came out while we were on hiatus.  But so, it just wasn't accurate.  No?  People just don't eat like that.  Well, no. 
[00:17:00]  I don't think he was saying that people eat like that.  It's just kind of showing an extreme case of it.  Yeah, but the whole concept was that he was just going to eat McDonald's, you know, when  he needed to eat.  Right.  Like, you're eating that little bagel thing there.  I'm trying.  So, instead, you would have something from McDonald's.  Yeah.  And that would be it.  And then you'd have something from McDonald's for lunch, and then for dinner.  Right.  But this guy was just pigging out, to make his point, is what I'm saying.  You think?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Well, we could get into it with him. 
[00:17:30]  It seemed like he was eating, you know, enough to satisfy himself each time.  And I want him to be honest.  I think he was sneaking a lot more food, also, when the cameras weren't running.  Because the movie wouldn't have been as effective if he didn't gain a lot of weight.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And all of his blood work didn't come back, like he was ready to stroke out or something.  No, stop.  He was like, I think when the cameras weren't rolling, he was just shoving his face at every  possible second.  Yes, there was a large...  He was doing it during the movie.  Like, if you saw him in the drive-through, when he got his bag, he was ordering more than 
[00:18:00]  just the meal.  He had tons of stuff in that bag to take around with him the whole day.  Yeah.  You had to order one thing off the menu with everything at least once.  Yeah.  And if only it would supersize it if they asked him to supersize it.  Yeah.  I mean, again, what he did off camera, though, you never know.  Because just to make the point.  Yeah.  On camera, though.  I mean, you know...  It was effective.  I'm thinking...  Yeah, of course.  Are you surprised, though?  Huh?  Are you surprised?  What do you mean?  I was, like, pretty shocked.  I'm just a big expose.  And the fact that, like, McDonald's is unhealthy.  Yeah.  Whoa!  It's really going out on a limb there. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, man.  I mean, some guys just get in there and really dig out the dirt.  I'm just thinking if you're going to film a documentary like that, you're going to want  to make it to look good, obviously.  So, you're not going to stick to the rules when the camera's not rolling.  You're going to be trying to shove more food in you to make your point.  You know?  Unless you're doing, you know, an accurate documentary.  Nah, I don't think he was.  We'll get into it.  We'll see what he is willing to admit now that he's made his money and it's out on DVD.  Mm-hmm.  I think there was some stuff going on there.  When is he coming in?  In a week or two, I guess. 
[00:19:00]  I saw that.  I swear to God, as bad as it is, it made me want to get McDonald's.  Because I do love the occasional McDonald's.  What's better?  You do?  Really?  Two cheeseburgers and a large fry.  What is better than that in your fat face?  Nothing.  Nothing better.  Once a month, you can get away with it.  Yeah.  You can get away with it once a week.  Easily.  Easily.  You exercise, dude.  You're in great shape, actually.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That little V.  All right.  Calm down.  Kip, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How are you?  Pretty good, man. 
[00:19:30]  Yesterday, you were talking about new talent coming to the channel.  Oh, yeah.  I was wondering, are you going to go visit them and make a dominatrix cry?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Punching out.  Punching out.  Let's go to Tony in Vermont.  I don't know what that was about, Anthony.  I don't know.  Opie.  Yeah, Tony.  Hey, you know what the worst thing about rollerblading is?  What?  Telling your dad you're gay.  I'm punching out. 
[00:20:00]  Why?  Can't punch out.  You crashed.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Give me the car.  I love the car.  No.  No car for you, mister.  You'll get nothing unlike it.  Huh?  That is so stupid.  Yeah, rollerblader, you can't call that gay.  Unless you're rollerblading behind certain areas of Central Park, then maybe because  you're rollerblading for all reasons.  You know, if you're going to go on the air and admit that you like ballet, then there's  the joke or something.  My God.  Uh-oh.  Pat from Munaki checking in about the movie Supersize Me. 
[00:20:30]  He goes, that movie was like porno for me.  That's pretty funny.  That isn't bad.  I don't like when Pat is funny.  I know.  I hate that.  You should have blown it on the read-through.  Yeah.  It should have made it really bad, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Do you see him sitting there jerking off?  Oh, yeah.  Eat another.  Get the quarter pounder.  I almost say get the double whopper, and then I realize wrong franchise, fat tits.  That's right.  Well, we got some good stuff for the show today, right off the bat. 
[00:21:00]  Ooh.  Well, we ended the show yesterday.  Yeah.  With a, well, kind of boring interview, yeah.  I was mulling that over in my head all night, and trying to figure out where it kind of  went awry, that whole interview.  I obsessed about it, you know, out of the building.  Yeah, you obsessed.  Well, not as bad as I used to.  I mean, obviously, I had your ear all the way back to the garage, and then I took off 
[00:21:30]  for my abode.  And by the time I got home, I forgot about it, because I had to go to Long Island for the  day, and hand out the Hustler magazines to my entire family.  My entire family.  Just a little quick side thing.  Yeah.  Had to hand them to them in, like, brown paper bags and stuff, because my brother has kids,  my sister has kids.  Handing the smut out to your family.  My mom's there, so I got scissors.  I'm cutting out the article, and cutting out some of the pictures that are part of our  article.  Is there a big cock on the back of it, though? 
[00:22:00]  Like, you cut it out and turn it over in the big cock?  Nah, just a naked cartoon on the back.  Oh, is it?  Okay, that's...  Yeah, just a naked cartoon.  My mom could handle it.  She just didn't want to go into the store and buy the...  No, who wants to?  Buy the article.  You know, so, talking about the July 2005 issue.  It's finally hitting newsstands.  We're in it.  Yep.  But anyway, yeah, so by the time I, you know, jumped in my car and headed toward Long Island,  I was fine with it, but...  Yeah.  I was bummed.  I was just trying to figure it out.  Like, it didn't suck, but I was just hoping it was going to be a lot more than it was. 
[00:22:30]  I was thinking we had, you know, we had Travis Tritt come in.  Knew nothing about Travis Tritt.  He came in, sat down, and it was a very easy, natural conversation for him to just fit in.  A lot of people loved that interview, by the way.  It was really cool.  Yeah.  It was great to sit down and talk to.  And then yesterday, Alex came in.  What's her last name?  Borstein.  Alex Borstein.  And she was cool.  I don't want to trash her or anything.  No, no, no.  Totally cool.  Totally cool.  There was nothing going on there at all.  I blame us.  We have a problem with women. 
[00:23:00]  We are so bad with women.  I kind of told you that on the sidewalk, too.  Yeah.  I said, when intelligent women come in here that actually have a brain, we're like almost  dumbfounded.  Like, ah.  Like, they sit there, and then we try to talk.  There's no way to get the conversation going.  Like, we didn't know much about her except for her involvement with the family guy and  Mad TV.  No real specifics or anything.  We didn't know really any more about her than we did about Travis Tritt. 
[00:23:30]  But for some reason, when a woman sits down to have an interview to do anything but shove  a wiffle ball bat in her, we just have this problem.  We can't really carry on a conversation with her.  Are you trying to say we can't carry on a conversation with an intelligent woman?  Yeah.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  That is just awful to say.  If it's anything but smut coming in here with tits, we have a problem.  Man. 
[00:24:00]  And I don't get it.  That's all I could, after assessing it in my head last night, that's all I could really  come up with.  I don't know why.  If we're out in a personal, you know, just out to dinner or something, and there's women  around us, I'll carry on a conversation.  Yeah.  It'd be great.  But for some reason, in the context of this program, it is impossible for us to have an  exchange with a woman.  Why is that?  I don't know.  It was a herky-jerky interview.  It was.  It was like pulling teeth, as they say.  Like pulling teeth.  Like we would ask her something about the show, we'd get an answer, and there was no 
[00:24:30]  way to elaborate.  I'm sitting here going, I want to add something to this, but I got nothing.  Like, eh.  Yeah.  She's going to find out that we're stupid if we talk too long.  It's just, I don't know what it is.  I'm not intimidated or anything.  It had nothing to do with that.  It was just, it's just carrying on a conversation with a woman on this program.  Yeah.  There's just no reason for it.  You're right. 
[00:25:00]  Very rarely there's no reason for it.  Jesus.  That's it.  You've never developed that skill, because why, when are you going to need that on this  show?  Very once in a while.  When are you going to need that?  No reason for it.  Greg on Long Island.  Greg?  I'm one of those listeners who listen to replays over and over and over again.  It wasn't her that was boring.  I mean, yeah, it wasn't a great interview, but the guy that called at the end there, oh,  he even didn't know what to say.  He was like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Well, he's like the creator of the show, and does a lot of the voices on the show. 
[00:25:30]  It's Seth.  Yeah.  He had nothing to say.  He's a nerdy guy.  Yeah.  And it was only like, uh, I don't know, ten minutes or five minutes he was on the phone,  and he was completely spent.  I was kind of bummed, because I'm a huge Family Guy fan, and I just, uh, was hoping  for so much more out of that last half hour of the show yesterday.  That's a tough interview, though.  Phoners are tough, man.  I've done phoners that are really...  He might be great in studio, but they're very hard to do sometimes.  You don't know what's going on in the studio, and you just...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doing cartoon voice has got to be a rough way to make a living anyway.  All right.  He's used to being behind the camera and not, like, you know, dealing with people. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, and then you come out, you're on mic, and you've got to be entertaining.  All right.  Thanks, Greg.  Well, it wasn't your fault.  No, it's okay.  I think it was a little bit.  Yeah, in the end, it's got to be our fault.  We've got to, you know...  If it wasn't going well, we could have cut it short or something.  We've got to entertain the masses out there.  We just have this issue where we can't talk to women.  We call it shame.  We kind of acknowledged that on the way home yesterday.  Yep.  Anthony and I, where did you...  I was there.  I definitely heard it.  You weren't really talking about it with us. 
[00:26:30]  You were just kind of...  You were just shy.  A little shy.  A little shy.  Oh, there you go.  For the faithful listeners, there's something to look forward to now.  The next time an intelligent woman comes in here, see how we handle it.  It's just really bad for some reason.  I don't know.  Look forward to that next time we have one.  All right.  Why don't we take a really quick break?  When we get back, we've got the Tony Danza clips from yesterday.  Okay.  We ended the show listening in on Tony Danza and Rosie talking.  Oh.  And we got just a great clip from her new Hallmark movie. 
[00:27:00]  Ooh.  Coming up this Sunday.  Ooh.  Your homework assignment for this show is to watch it so you can have fun with us on the  phones.  Because we are going to rip it apart.  I can't imagine what clips we're going to have to choose from where we go, well, pick  this one but not this one.  It's going to be every second of dialogue that she does as a retard that we are going  to want to listen to.  Well, we could do just a four-hour show on the movie.  That's it.  Just play the movie and it's going to be Mystery Science Theater.  Oh, that's what we should do.  We're just going to comment on the movie.  That's what we should do.  All right. 
[00:27:30]  When we get back, we've got the clips from Rosie's new movie where she plays a retard  and fans are talking about it.  Let's be open-minded, guys.  Let's.  You're right, Jimmy.  First, we should just reintroduce ourselves with Twato.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  I think that's.  Twato, man.  Yeah, let's.  See, that's something negative.  If I would have taken that off, it wouldn't have been a good radio show.  See, you're right.  See, I didn't have it taken off.  Very smart. 
[00:28:00]  And you're still convinced it's what?  A shaving accident that went wrong?  No, it's just something that I was meant to have you guys exploit.  Right.  Tetherball.  Yeah, but what is it?  No, I'm just saying.  What do you think it is?  I forget what you used to tell us.  I remember shaving once.  You know, I was like a.  That's right.  A bottomless dancer.  Yeah.  And on 42nd Street and 8th Avenue at this place called Las Vegas Bar.  And I said, you know, my pussy is too hairy.  I said, yeah.  And everyone's shaving their pussy those days.  You know, they had that, you know, the little girl type of pussy. 
[00:28:30]  So I said, let me shave.  So I did.  And I think that's what happened.  And I never shaved again.  Really?  Because I swear that happened from shaving.  But.  Yeah, she.  I don't remember.  She hasn't shaved down there in a long time.  So you have a big bush that looks like someone's hiding in there.  Yeah.  A little Vietnamese guys in your fucking snapper hiding there.  Right.  Right.  Like your beard if you let it grow.  Ugh.  It's a genital war.  It's a genital war, but she will not admit it.  Never.  It is a genital war.  Let's take the pants off.  Yeah.  Let's take a look at it.  Hey. 
[00:29:00]  I don't know.  My pussy is like up for it.  You know.  But anyway.  Show it.  Don't be shy.  Yeah.  Don't be shy.  Calm down.  We've all seen the naked.  Calm down.  We've all seen the naked.  Calm down.  Move your hand.  Yeah.  We gotta see that.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Rich is throwing up.  Wow!  It's gotten bigger.  It's gotten bigger. 
[00:29:30]  Oh!  You could see like Gene Wilder.  It looks like a brain in a jar in a lab.  Rich threw up.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, Rich.  Look, look, look, look.  Rich, look at it.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Look at it, Rich.  Have a second.  Have a second.  No, it's really a horse shape.  Remember Valentine's Day?  Oh.  Ew.  Oh my God.  What the fuck?  What is that?  Jesus, put an APB on that fucking...  Rich can't take it. 
[00:30:00]  Would you suck that into your mouth really slow?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Somebody actually sucked on that.  Somebody's fucking that?  It's like a speed bump by the pussy.  I haven't had sex in a long time.  I can't imagine why.  Look at that thing.  Really?  Mr. Polo.  Polo.  Polo sucked on that.  Who?  Polo.  Remember Polo from Ron and Fez?  Yeah.  That fat guy?  Yeah.  With the fat stomach?  He didn't suck on that.  He did not.  He sucked on Twato.  I sucked his dick, but he didn't suck Twato. 
[00:30:30]  Isn't there one in the back door, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, you have a hemorrhoid.  Yeah.  What are you thinking about this?  Her pussy looks like a rubber glove hanging and she's laughing.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  What can I do, Rich?  What am I going to kill myself?  Get it cut off.  No.  That's what everybody does with those.  Yeah, but then I couldn't be on here and expose it.  I'm just taking around in a jar with you.  Yeah.  I just know.  I know.  I mean, I like it.  I like my Twato.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  More human than human. 
[00:31:00]  More human than human.  More human than human.  More human than human.  More human than human.  More human than human.  More human than human.  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  The Friday edition.  Had another great week of radio.  A lot of fun.  Tim Norton's going to Boston after the show.  Right after the show, right?  Yeah, by noon I'll be on the road. 
[00:31:30]  Me and Kenny going up together.  Oh!  Playing the comedy connection up there in Boston all weekend long.  Pretty much sold out, I think.  Someone told me that the Saturday shows were sold and there's a little bit left tonight.  So if you want tickets, you know.  Very nice.  And then Anthony and I, I think we have to walk a couple blocks and do a quick appearance  at the Hilton Hotel or something.  Yeah, they're doing some kind of a home entertainment show over there.  You know, one of those trade show kind of things?  Yeah.  And we'll be there because XM Satellite Radio is home entertainment.  There you go.  That's the reason we're there. 
[00:32:00]  That's why we're there.  We're going to stand around and then we're going to have these geeky sales guys come up  to us.  Oh no.  Talk about their products.  Oh God, not more of that.  How they love the show.  And they want to, could you come over here because I want to show you what we're working  on.  Right.  And then we've got to look and go, ooh, that's nice.  Can I go home now?  I was going to make the trip to Boston but I don't know.  I think I just need a weekend of mellow out.  Just want to do nothing, right?  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  I'm looking forward to that just relaxing.  I'm tired, man.  Like I want to do the gigs and relax, take some time in New York and just hang out.  That's it.  Hang out, do nothing.  Finally not do that stupid Iraq joke.  I'm so sick of my dumb voice and this material.  It's hysterical.  You shut up.  You want to move on though and just get on with this stuff.  Is that how it works?  You kind of go like, oh, I'm sick of hearing my own voice.  Jokes become like fat shakes really quick.  You're like, I'm right already with you.  I know you're there when I need you.  Oh God.  And it feels really good when you come up with a brand new one, right?  Yeah, awesome. 
[00:33:00]  Nothing better.  Rich in Boston, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I'm a union bridge painter up here and I listened to you guys since 8 a.m.  and then when you were syndicated out of New York.  And of course, I've even got my friends to get the show.  Oh, cool.  Well, and behold, I listened to you this morning.  I get out of my truck.  I jump in a work truck, start it up and I hear little Jimmy Norton's voice on the radio.  Well, what the hell?  They get XM?  Boston Comedy Club advertising on BCN on the Stern show. 
[00:33:30]  He's getting fucked all around.  Oh, that's very, very funny.  Little Jimmy Norton.  Advertised.  We love the gang at WBCN, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  They're good guys, but he's going to get killed when he goes to the satellite radio.  Well, I think that's a very obvious thing now.  I think people are starting to figure that out.  When Logan showed us those...  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Eric Logan one time took us into his awful office and showed us these pie charts.  And that's one thing he's good at is pie charts.  Pie charts.  Of what XM has as far as factory installs. 
[00:34:00]  It's just embarrassing, man.  That's what this whole thing is.  It's factory installs and it's just they're murdering.  Yep.  Serious.  Yes, sir.  Oh, it's John Clayton.  I thought it was Joe Clayton.  Rich?  Yeah.  Hey, one other quick thing.  Yeah, go ahead.  Because of you guys, I'm flipping through Maxim Magazine, a new issue.  Okay.  I see Rich Voss has a little interview there.  I swear to God, I caught myself talking out loud in his big stupid slurring voice and 
[00:34:30]  mispronouncing words.  While you read the interview, right?  You play along.  It's just goddamn horrible.  Hey, I got a punch outta here.  I'm at work.  All right, buddy.  Thanks for listening.  Have a good one.  There he goes, Rich from Boston.  You know how immature I think I am?  Because there's a story here and there's like a cratchety person that doesn't find something  funny and I find it very funny.  It seems in Mishawaka, Indiana, a situation that looked like someone trying to kidnap children  actually turned out to be a very poorly timed prank. 
[00:35:00]  A pickup truck playing ice cream truck music in a neighborhood caused parents to call  police.  It turns out it was two high school boys who thought it would be funny to play the music  through a loudspeaker and watch the kids come running out to the street.  So Barry Dickerson of Rose Park blew the whistle on the pickup truck and called the cops.  They thought someone was trying to lure children with the music to maybe do bad things.  So Dickerson says, Attracting little kids to a strange vehicle. 
[00:35:30]  I don't see how that's funny.  I see that as something I want to do right now.  Like the second I read it, I'm like, I want to do that.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  You play the music and just watch them come out with the disappointment on their little  stupid faces.  Clutching their little dollar bills.  All their little dollars running out the door.  That's hysterical.  That's really funny.  That is really funny.  That's a good prank.  We're all losing our senses of humor, I gotta tell you.  Barry Dickerson, another quote, it was not a very funny prank. 
[00:36:00]  What kind of pedophile hooks up a loudspeaker system to his car?  No one does that.  You just snatch the kid.  Yeah, they're on the DL.  Psst, come here, you need a ride?  They don't feel...  music, blaring it.  Black paper?  40 kids this time?  I can't believe it.  In the trunk, kids, you get in the back seats.  You'll meet us down there.  But the second I read it, I'm like, I want to do that.  I just want to see their dopey little wanting faces. 
[00:36:30]  Stop.  Stop.  Shut up.  That is really, really funny.  Really funny.  All right, very good.  They mature.  You want to do the Rosie O'Donnell clips?  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  From Tony Danza yesterday?  Of course.  There's an ad right here with her picture riding the bus with my sister, and it's just  makes me angry how awful it is.  The ad itself is a Forrest Gump-looking ripoff thing.  They have her sitting on a park bench, a bus bench, whatever it is, with the clouds in 
[00:37:00]  the background, the same type of Forrest Gump look.  I guess she's going for her Emmy.  Is that what this is?  I was hoping for an Emmy.  Anybody that plays a retard on a TV movie is really gunning for that Emmy.  Had her on Tony Danza yesterday.  Somebody on one of the message boards popped up a website also.  She has a photo website.  You know how people have photo websites?  You can post your pictures of your vacations or family get-togethers or whatever it is.  She has one of those.  And I went to it, and it's just her, like, they have one of her girlfriend there and 
[00:37:30]  her laying in bed together, like a picture of a girlfriend's face looking all like they  just woke up in the morning.  Picture Rosie's face on the pillow.  Rosie's a big, fat mess, but she did well for herself.  Yeah, she didn't look that bad at all.  I mean, her chick.  I mean, if you're going to be a lesbian, I mean, she did all right, man.  She did all right.  And then she's got her pictures of her kids on vacation.  It's like this, she's just got this need, I guess, to open her life up to the public  like that.  Like, out of nowhere, all of a sudden, she came out of the closet and now everything. 
[00:38:00]  Look at these pictures.  They're just like anyone's pictures that would be online.  What kind of an idiot would put their pictures all over the...  And she writes all personal stuff in her blog.  Yeah, right.  What kind of idiot would do that?  Yeah, man.  Her...  See, look at the picture.  There's the two of them in bed.  Where, where's the bed picture?  That was it.  That's the one?  The bed.  That's not...  No, back up.  Back up, Eric.  Walk back.  Down.  Yeah, right there.  The two next to each other.  You see Rosie's on the pillow or something. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, wow.  That's creepy, yeah.  She's kind of a porter.  Oh, yeah.  Her girlfriend's a porter.  Wasn't she...  No, that's not her...  That's her other friend.  That's not the one she's sleeping with.  That's the chick...  I hate to admit this, but I...  You know who that is?  Yeah, she used to work on the Rosie O'Donnell show.  What, faggot?  I know, I know.  I know.  That's really bad.  Which is the one that she's a...  Which one is she...  That one right there.  Yeah?  The much thinner one.  Yeah, it says Us in L.A.  That's her.  Us.  She's a hot little blonde.  If you keep going, I think there's better pictures of her. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  But she was on Tony Danza yesterday, plugging her show, her movie.  And I have been a fan over the years of made-for-TV retard movies.  I love them.  Can't get enough watching people try to act retarded.  And like Jimmy has said in the past, for some reason, that's totally acceptable.  It's fine.  People watch.  They do little goofy things.  There's always these comic moments where they're screwing something up in a retarded way. 
[00:39:30]  And the audience laughs along.  And that's fine.  Right.  But Jimmy gets on stage and does a retard joke.  And, you know, you're the Antichrist.  You suck.  You stink.  You should burn in hell.  Do a cute little reference about like, hey, there's a retarded person.  Let's pick up a stick and molest it.  It.  Molest it.  So what?  The lacrosse team wants to do a little, have a little fun with her.  Yeah.  So what?  They throw milk money on her chest and they're finished.  There's no skill in acting retarded, too. 
[00:40:00]  None.  None whatsoever.  None.  We've all done it our whole, you know, our whole lives.  Why is it looked at like this big acting challenge that is so amazing when they do?  It's the easiest thing to do.  They all put on the stupid retard voice and walk around stupid.  Tom Hanks and Forrest Gump, he did a good job.  Ben's been doing it for years.  You've got to give him credit.  But a lot of these other movies that come out, I'm just reminded of being in high school with my friends.  And we all did the retard voice and stuff. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  I want to be like a normal person.  There.  Give me a fucking Emmy.  If Rosie wants to win an Emmy, she should act thin.  That would be impressive.  Act thin and act like you love dick.  Who's the thin chick with the cock in her hand?  That's Rosie.  Give her an award.  Amazing.  So she's got this movie.  It's coming out Sunday.  Do we have the Corky CD?  We've got to get the Corky CD.  Corky.  Oh, Corky. 
[00:41:00]  Singing Poison Ivy.  Now that guy should win an award.  Because that's a real retard acting in a TV series.  How they got him to do anything is amazing.  You see some of these guys, they're just banging their heads.  Ah!  Going crazy.  And they actually, you know, you follow direction.  Well, I bet you, if you, like, look behind the scenes, right off camera, there's the director  and his parents holding cow prods.  So, like, if he didn't say his lines right, he got a good jolt and a fat thigh.  Gave him a teaching.  We've interviewed Corky over the years. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You, um, I remember I was at the studio at B.A.B. once, and it had a door with a little  glass window in it.  A little glass window.  I'm so proud of you that you remember this one.  Oh, this one was a fine Opie moment.  Shining moment.  And, uh, this guy is peeking in the window.  He looks in the window.  And obviously...  And he's just like, ah!  He has Down syndrome.  And, and Opie points to the window.  He goes, hey, look, Corky's at the window.  Joking.  Because we start laughing. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, because that's what, every time you see a retard, you go, hey, Corky.  It's Corky.  And, um, lo and behold, it was Corky.  He was there to do an interview.  I didn't know it at the time, though.  I really didn't.  But what are you supposed to do?  So, we invited him in, and, uh, it was just awful radio for five or ten minutes.  You do have a similar look, you know.  Was he nice?  Actually, he was really cool.  I gotta, I gotta admit.  You didn't ask about the script or the, or the plot lines.  Do you like cookies?  That's what it's pretty much. 
[00:42:30]  Blow a pinwheel in front of his face for 15 minutes and then send him on his way.  Ooh.  He was doing a children's CD at the time.  Yeah.  Remember the creepy guys that were, you know, his handlers or whatever you want to call them?  Weren't they following him around?  A couple of musicians that, um, took him under, under their wing and, and had him singing songs.  That was another thing.  Two guys decided they were going to hook up with Corky and, um, have him sing on their, uh, on their CD. 
[00:43:00]  It was just awful.  What were they doing?  Songs like Poison Ivy?  Yeah, we used to have the CD, but it's like, Poison Ivy comes to creeping when you're,  Hey, you're bad at baby!  They could just throw in this bad line every so often.  Ooh.  Then they took him to Romania and put a little hat on him and made him dance to make tourists happy.  With a muzzle on so it doesn't bite anybody.  We're talking, ruin your day.  What?  What is he talking about? 
[00:43:30]  What the hell is he talking about?  That's funny.  You're an idiot.  All right, so we got some clips.  Tony Danza and Rosie O'Donnell talking here.  The retard.  Yeah.  Here's like an intro clip.  They gave me a copy of this movie.  It's called Riding the Bus with My Sister.  And it's directed by one of our dear friends, Angelica Houston, who we love.  Yeah.  And Andy McDowell's in the picture, and, you know, it's Rosie playing a special person.  Yeah.  And...  Take that, a retard! 
[00:44:00]  Playing a special person.  You know Tony Danza's like, hey, he's playing a fucking retard, you know?  He's a special person.  I can't wait till she thanks him for being the inspiration in the film.  Hey, you're welcome, all right?  Jackass.  Tony's hungry today.  People just sound stupid and uncomfortable when they're trying to be politically correct.  A special person.  He sounded completely uncomfortable.  Playing a...  A...  A...  A... 
[00:44:30]  A dumb...  A special person.  Special person.  What does that mean?  Exactly.  It's not special!  I understand you want to say they're special.  If you're the parent of a...  A mentally disabled child,  I'm sure you want to say they're special.  They're not special!  They got a problem.  Something happened.  Why is it only in that case where something that's not good is special?  Right.  Special is always good.  Oh, look, my special girl.  Right.  Oh, look at that special... 
[00:45:00]  Special gift I got.  Yeah.  It's very special.  Look at my special child.  Oh, the boy's an honor roll.  You're doing an HBO special.  That's right.  It's special!  Oh, and there it kind of fits in.  Yeah, but when it's bad,  you know, because your kid came out with a couple of chromosomes.  There's a lot of people out there that would say that's not a bad thing,  that they had a special kid.  Really?  Yes.  Ooh.  That it has enriched their lives.  Oh, I know what they got. 
[00:45:30]  Whatever gets you through the day,  I understand.  Whatever you got to pump through your mind to make it...  ...so you don't jump out the window.  I understand.  I understand why you say special.  We all like lemonade, don't we?  Mm-hmm.  Because if you don't say special,  you'll lose your mind looking at the kid next door  that came out perfect and plays baseball...  Yeah.  ...and doesn't try to eat it.  I understand.  Believe me.  But it's not special.  And hearing Tony Danza say special, 
[00:46:00]  you could just hear it in his voice.  It's uncomfortable and not natural.  And you don't have to say,  hey, look, I hear you're playing a dummy.  But he could have said it like,  hey, Rosie is playing a retarded person.  There's nothing degrading about saying retarded person.  Your growth mentally has been retarded.  Retarded.  That's what it is.  Your growth has been like,  well, in that case,  it should be a stopped person.  Because retarded implies that there's still some growth there.  So you're reversed.  Yeah, but they don't like retarded  because it implies that there's no room for growth there. 
[00:46:30]  That they don't have the potential.  And, of course, they're special and do have the potential.  They're not retarded.  They are advancing on it.  Retarded.  Say retarded.  Everybody knows.  Can I just play the Stephen Lynch song?  Oh, which one?  And then we'll go back to this thing.  All right.  Does it make sense?  Yeah, it is.  I don't want to hear it.  I don't want to hear it.  Watch them run.  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.

[00:51:00]  It's a stereotype  Of a retard  The voice she does  Her mannerisms  It's not like  She's a great actress  And studied  Retards  And you know  Got every detail down  This is her  Back in Comac  In high school  Goofing on a retard  It's pretty much  What she's doing  And they're filming it  She probably had  The same character  During Powderpuff  Yeah  Did you guys have  Powderpuff  In your high school  Where you do  Goofy skits  For the rest of the school  It was called  The talent show 
[00:51:30]  For some reason  They called it  Powderpuff  At Harborfield  Jesus  Awful  I know  Powderpuff  Powderpuff  Why would they call it  Powderpuff  I have no idea man  How gay is it  Well who put it  Who put it on  The drama department  Yeah the skits were pretty  Gay  Powderpuff  It was pretty gay  It was pretty awful  It was pretty stupid  There is not one  Drama department  In one school  Anywhere in the world  That is not run  By gay people  Not that there's  Anything wrong with it 
[00:52:00]  That's right  Yes  Powderpuff  Oof  When I was a little boy  I was in the school play  And I only had one  Like a couple lines  I don't remember them  But it was about  A boy who was dirty  And I said  Maybe we should have him  Dry cleaned  That was my acting line  Did people laugh  I don't remember  I was so scared  I stunk  What play was it  I don't know  Did you have poopy  In your pants  I'm sure I did afterwards  Little rusty drawers  Flattened shite  Flattened from nervous boys  Sitting in it

Ha ha  No not Britney  I'm coming back  And you're a Dolpho  And you're new  How'd you know my name?  You're new  Cause I know everything  Ha ha  Listen  I have to stop on Carlton Street  Carlton's not a bus stop  And listen to Henry  You have to stop there  Because  Ms. Pack has a swollen up leg 
[00:55:30]  And she has to go to Dr. at 11  So  Stop on Carlton Street  Rudolpho  And listen to me  Because I only tell you two times  That's it  Then you're on your own  Morning Mr. Breakfast  Can I have some Mr. Cheese Cereal?  Okay  Ha ha  I pity the poor fool  Don't eat that cereal  Ha ha  Great  Her great acting job as a retard  Is Pee-wee Herman 
[00:56:00]  She's ripping off Pee-wee  Okay  Ha ha  Where's the bus gonna stop?  Ha ha ha  Ha ha  Ha ha  Ha ha  Oh my god  Look at the bus  Cabin Curtis  Ha ha  Hi Cabin Curtis  Ha ha ha  Captain Carl  Captain Carl  Here comes Mr. Vod Captain Carl  Ha ha  Ha ha  Ha ha  Ha ha  Ha ha  Ha ha  Ah  Unbelievable  It's Pee-wee  It's Pee-wee Herman  I bet you too 
[00:56:30]  I haven't seen the clip  That she's not getting on a short bus  No  It's a regular  No it's a regular bus  It's a regular like city bus  Oh city bus  Okay  I wasn't sure if it was  She was getting picked up for school or something  Oh my god  I do like the fact that the driver scolds her  Yeah  It's not a stop  Not a bus stop  Not a bus stop you tard  That would be worth it if everyone in the movie talked to her like that no matter what she said  No it's not  No it's not dummy  Good try  I'm sure you'd have that little chit chat if that happened in New York City with one of these New York City bus drivers 
[00:57:00]  I'm sure he would be just as polite  You know what you'd hear  Pshhhh  Shut up  Shut up and sit down  I'm late  We have to stop  We have to stop  And the other stop  No we can shut up  Shut up  Sit in your seat or I'll throw your dumb ass off  Right  There's no chit chatting going on  Shitting and chatting  Shut up  You and your fat stretch arm strong legs  No bend marks  No bend marks at all  Not even a dimple 
[00:57:30]  So what do you think is going to happen to Rosie in this movie?  We should take bets  Oh how does it go?  You know there's going to be that dramatic moment where maybe she gets lost or something  And now she's all confused looking at the big buildings  That's definitely going to be insane  Where she gets lost  Gets lost  Starts looking at the big buildings  And eventually I bet you they find her at the end and everything's going to be okay  I think that's just a sub thing  I think the whole thing is going to be the fact that somebody will think that she's not capable of doing something 
[00:58:00]  Maybe even her sister will think that there's some kind of shortcomings because of her being a retard  But then she will show everybody that she is indeed capable and inspire people  I think what's going to happen is that Rosie doesn't know how to express herself  And they're going to wander through the whole movie  Why does she buy tacos and then just rub her face in them and go  It's going to be a story of inspiration 
[00:58:30]  Maybe the other sister, Andy McDowell  Yeah  Has some kind of illness  Ah  Maybe  They don't work  No, you're on  Oh  I'm trying to use that phone  That's when she's at a pay phone, I think  Oh, these are more clips of Rosie  Oh, okay  These are more clips  I thought we only had the one  And then I guess she gets into an exchange about who the bus driver is  And the bus driver doesn't know who she is 
[00:59:00]  I know you are, but what am I?  That didn't make sense  I meant to do that  Okay  There you go  Okay  And she has some fun in the movie, too  Then she can't really hear the bus driver, I guess, at one point  Well  Well  I cannot wait to see this movie, by the way 
[00:59:30]  Dude, I can't wait for this show  For how I'm bashing this, cannot wait to see it  I just want to know what the conflict's going to be  There's going to be some stupid conflict  Yeah  Dumb conflict  Yeah  It can't just be her riding the bus the whole movie, can it?  No  That'll be perfect  I hope there's a little problem  I hope there's something  Does she do a crying scene, you think?  You think there's a retarded crying scene in it?  No, but I'm sure Bob Kelly will be crying when he watches the movie  Him and his bum leg 
[01:00:00]  Jesus  That's right  You know, it's so sweet, the siblings, and I love that  Blubbering gimp  He'll be on the couch eating ho-hos  Just going through tissues  We're halfway through this  Dennis Hopper's going to call  There's a retard on the bus  If you don't hand over the money, I'll have her talk until everybody kills himself  Okay  Did they chat a little after the clip?  Yeah, yeah, we got that  Here it is 
[01:00:30]  The fake laugh  And then he laughs like a retard  Yeah, this is where it picks up right after the clip plays, obviously  They're going back to Tony live  Sweet  Very sweet  Yeah, I haven't been able to watch it  You haven't watched it?  Now, I watched some of the early cuts when Angelica was putting it together  And honestly, all credit of this movie belongs to her  That woman is not only the best actor we have in America  But she's an amazing director  And I had to cry a lot of this 
[01:01:00]  I was very scared of playing a role that's so challenging  And she made it easy  This is a kid who, her life becomes whole when she starts riding the bus  All the buses  She has all the bus drivers, all the passengers  She knows everybody and everything about them  Right, and that's sort of all she does  She has a form of mental retardation  She falls somewhere in the autism spectrum  And she will only do the bus  When the buses are off on Sunday  She just waits at home until the bus  She's the first one at the stop 
[01:01:30]  Every time she tells people who's been on, who's been off  And she knows everything there is to know about the buses  Did you meet the real Beth?  You know, I didn't  But she's a real person  She sure is  And her sister Rachel takes care of her  And Rachel sort of felt it would be very disruptive for Beth  To meet new people  So I didn't meet her  But I have a friend who has a sister named Cynthia  Who is very much like Beth  Only instead of the buses, she loves Broadway  So she knows everything about Broadway 
[01:02:00]  What show was on where and what theater and what day  And so I went to see a few shows with Cynthia  And a lot of my character is based on Cynthia  As well as a tape that I saw of Beth  But I never did get to meet her  Although her whole dream of her life is to go to Disney World  So when the movie wrapped, I got her four tickets on the sleeper bus  The Greyhound bus to go to Disney World  Yeah, you see  To meet new people  Right, to meet new people on the bus is what I thought  I hope it ends up on the side of a ditch on 95 
[01:02:30]  You know, they have to wait until she's in a place where she understands  That she's going to go  And her therapist will go with her  But I hope she gets to do that  I wanted to put her on the bus  So the fucking dummy didn't charge the cockpit  Put her on the bus  That's great  That's great for the poor minimum wage Disney employees  Down there having to deal with that  Yeah  Oh  Great, thank you Rosie  A sleeper bus  You're just a wonderful American 
[01:03:00]  You always do the right thing  Like it's not bad enough to be on a bus either  You know  To be on a bus  And this nut's got to be on there  Little kid at Disney  Molly, who's wearing the dumbbell costume?  Now, now  Now, now  Jesus  Oh, that ain't good  Oh, that bugged me  What a method actress  Yeah, I watched the tape  Way to throw yourself into the role, fatso  Didn't even meet the girl  I guess she would have been 
[01:03:30]  Like she said  To  Which only goes to show you  She's probably  Eight billion times more crazy  In real life  Than Rosie's playing her up to be  Rosie's going to play her up to be  You know  Oh, look how sweet  And look how functional  And  She should have got ready for the role  By sniffing glue  Before every take  Right  Put that bag up to your mouth  Paint, glue  Paint thinner  Jesus  De Niro would have done it  Hey, how did you prepare for the role?  Well, I crawled into my mother's womb  And I had her drink  Big bag of lead paint chips 
[01:04:00]  Chowing down  Saying some stupid movie  Making believe it's popcorn  Cutting her own oxygen off  For way longer than she should  And when I start to black out 
[01:04:30]  Take the bag off my head  Hey, you know  De Niro would have done it that way  Right  Everyone knows what he did  To get ready for the Raging Bull  That's a real actor  That is a real actor  She watches a tape of a retard  And she's got it down  Goes to a Broadway show  With someone who just ruins  The play for everyone  Brrrr  Right  Why is that person doing that?  Shh  Shh  Shh  Yeah  Oh, just the shushes 
[01:05:00]  That must have been going on  Adler  That's pretty  The dress is up  Shh  Shut up  Dolt  Imagine getting stuck behind that head  Big giant head  Can't see the set  Had to wait a year  To get these tickets  Can't see anything  This daytime hack  Just gets front row  Oh  Steve C's there  I really  I just wanted to say  I thought you did a wonderful job 
[01:05:30]  Bravo  Bravo  Could you cut some liners for us?  Steve C's a big Broadway fan  No, is he really?  Yeah  Goes to a lot of shows  Oh, he doesn't  Yes, he does  Let's go to Zach  Yo  Come on, Zach  Hey, I know the dramatic event  In Rosie's movie  Huh  Bob Kelly's gonna take her to the basement  And hold her  Hold a rock over her  Until she puts out  Bunch it out, boys  Have a good one  Yeah  That would be it  What are you doing? 
[01:06:00]  Ha ha  I'm being gang banged  Ha ha ha  We haven't explored this emotional side of Bob Kelly  We have to call him and see if this is the type of movie he would cry over  Hmm  If he knows that we're all looking, he probably wouldn't  Yeah  Because he'd be fighting, but alone on his couch  If he was home alone, he'd be blubbering  With that dumb leg up, smoking a cigarette  Dude, Bob will do this  This is what Bob does  He rehearses what he's gonna say  This is what a bore Bob is  And I hope you're listening, stupid  You'll show up and he'll just sit down  And he'll be like, you know, dude  And he'll just start talking 
[01:06:30]  And it's like, you rehearsing motherfucker  Don't have these  He rehearses, like, just conversation  He, Bob wants to be smart  And he'll walk around the house  And he'll just go, you know, dude  And he'll, like, pontificate  And sound smart to him  Because he's an idiot  And then you sit down  And you're like, you are fucking  What is this droll nonsense  You're firing at me  Dude, you know, the government  Shut up  Ha ha ha  Shut your mouth  Ha ha ha  We gotta get Bob Kelly on today  Ben's listening, he'll try to get it 
[01:07:00]  I want to punch him  Right in his bad knee  Right in that ripped tendon  I want to just drill my fist  You're calling him good  Uh, Waylon from Georgia  Yes, uh, I have a little thing  Uh, I'll say we hang her  Then we, then we scare her  Then we run her over  Not even gonna wait for him to finish  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was doing a lot  All right, Pat from Boston  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey  I think on the bus  She's gonna get her period  And her sister's gonna show her  How to put on a pad  And then everything will be okay 
[01:07:30]  The pad  She's fucking out  Now, make sure you roll it up  In tissue paper  And put it in the nearest  Waste paper basket  And wave it in the bus driver's face  Ha ha ha  Slap him in the face with it  Blindside him  While you're putting your fare in  Just pull out your used pad  And whack him in the face with it  And we'll see what kind of patience  The bus driver really has  Smacking over his mouth  And a mock kidnapping  Ha ha ha  Joe from Chicago  What's cracking, boys? 
[01:08:00]  What's up, Joe?  I've been listening to you guys  For about two weeks now  I am infected  Oh, thank you  Yeah  Thank you, Joe  Oh, is it me?  I look like I have a retard already  Rosie?  She already has Down syndrome  She kind of has that look  The big fat head  They had to keep stopping her  Going, look, could you look  A little smarter?  You know, this girl  Isn't really this stupid  I think  The only good ending  For this movie  Would be if she gets hit 
[01:08:30]  By a bus  That's the ironic ending  Yeah, go for the ironic ending  She actually gets hit by a bus  The bus runs over her retard head  And breaks its axle  And she survives  Ha ha ha  See that big thing pull away  What happened? 
[01:09:00]  What an annoyance  You're trying to go to work  Read the Times?

Nothing  I wanted to tell you that this is based on a true story  Yes  Yeah, Rosie was sort of saying that  Yeah  In that last clip  It was based on a true story  So I know how it ends  Oh  So if you guys want to know  Hell yeah, we want to know how it ends  Yeah, spoilers  She gets a bum leg  While Rosie, the retard 
[01:11:30]  She gets a bum leg  And her sister has to come  And it ruins her life  And then the bus driver takes over  And takes care of Rosie  So the bus driver takes care of her  Yeah, she gets a bum leg  And she can't walk  She has to be wheeled around  And the bus driver comes to the rescue  And takes care of her  And she lives at his house  So it's not that great of an ending  But  He lives at the bus driver's house  Geez, what's happening there?  Yeah, what is up with that?

They wouldn't send one over?  We should be able to see  These in advance  So we can comment 
[01:16:30]  We're probably going to  Give this show  Great ratings  People are going to watch it  Just to see Rosie's  Standout performance  As a retard  You know that  It's going to be hilarious  The confusion  At the hallmark offices  Like when they get  The overnight ratings  Why is this show  Number one  Men 18 and 34?

[01:18:00]  Of the passengers  And the bus drivers  And the bus routes  It's amazing  It's special  And the only thing she enjoys  Is riding the bus  Riding the bus  And that's the only thing  She can't do anymore  There you go  Because she has a bum leg  She's got a bum leg  So she can't ride the bus  Yeah  And that was her whole life  It must be like what  What kind of bum leg?  A Mabel King bum leg?  Because that's a bum leg  What kind of bum leg?  That she can't ride the bus  And the bus driver takes her  And  You know there's something

[01:19:30]  Ed was kind  With good intent  But just a little  Differential  Special Ed  Mama dropped him  On his hand  Now he's not so bright  Instead  He's a little bit special  Just a little bit special 
[01:20:00]  We'd play tag  And he'd get hurt  I'd play soldier  He'd eat dirt  I liked math  And a spelling bee  Ed liked  Talking to a tree  All special Ed  Mama dropped him

[01:21:30]  He grabbed a brick  And he swung in my head  And as he laughed at me  That's when I knew  Special Ed just made me special too  Now I laugh  Now I laugh  As I count bugs  I give strangers

[01:22:30]  That bastard Ed made me special  Just a little bit special  All right  Everybody talking about  The Opie and Anthony show  We don't care  Keep talking  I know I'm a loser  Anthony  You're a jerk off 
[01:23:00]  Opie  A douche  Anthony  You effing tool  Opie  I'm a tool  Anthony  I'm a dumb twat  Opie  Okay pathetic  Anthony  Someone just shoot me in the head  Back to you 
[01:23:30]  Opie  Hey everyone  It's your good pal  Phil McCracken  Boy I got a rock hard one  Here in my back  Cause I'm diddling myself  You're a kid toucher  I'll bag anything with a hole  Opie  Opie  Anthony 
[01:24:00]  Hey let's go touch some children  Okay terrific  Thank you  XM202  Hope you're enjoying the Opie and Anthony program 
[01:24:30]  We like to call it the ONA virus  We like to call it the ONA virus Anthony right  Right  Cause like a virus  You catch it  And it runs rampant  And it spreads  And it's cool  Like everyday you get callers from all over the country  They trickle in Anthony  I'm not gonna sit there and go  Oh they're just flooding in  But it starts with a little trickle  All of a sudden you get a call from Chicago  Oh my god I've been listening to you guys for two weeks  There's another guy that caught the virus after three hours  He said I've been listening to you guys for three hours  I'm hooked  Wow he must have caught a pretty strong strain of it 
[01:25:00]  And then we ask you to spread the virus to your friends  Of course  Maybe to your friends that don't have XM Satellite Radio  Let them listen  And that's where the company gets happy  Cause this show will turn people onto the platform  That maybe wouldn't have ran out and got XM Satellite Radio  Who knows  And they get it and realize  Wow this whole thing's pretty cool  One guy's pissed off at us because he pays for XM Satellite Radio  He's paying for all the channels but he only listens to our channel  Wow  There are people out there I gotta tell you they're strange  Hardcore 
[01:25:30]  They have to set their alarm clock to listen to the entire show  And then they listen to all the replays  And if they miss a replay they get really pissed off  And you know we're attempting to add some new shows onto this channel  Are you talking about listeners or you?  I don't  You know what I do?  And I'm just like a regular listener after the show  If I know we had a really good show  I will search out the replays definitely  If I know we stunk  It happens  You know when you're pulling this crap out of your ass everyday like we do  Sure  You know we have all this preparation in front of us 
[01:26:00]  But we don't know where we're gonna go  Yeah I just  Alright well that show just didn't happen today  And then I'll  I won't listen at all  I won't beat myself up  The old days I would  Yeah  I would but not anymore  So yesterday what did you choose to listen to?  I know  The show  Nah there was good parts of yesterday's show  Yeah  That's  First hour and a half was hysterical  And that's another reason why I don't obsess  Because it's  You can listen to the show whenever you want  And a lot of people have the my-fi  So they're taping the show now  And they know when we suck  And they'll fast forward  And you know  And they're reading message boards  So people will tell them what segments were 
[01:26:30]  You know pretty good  You know what I mean?  So they get an overall understanding of the show  And then some days they listen to the whole thing  Other days there might be just one or two segments  That just are really good  Standouts  Standout segments  So yesterday the show started off great  There were some moments  But there was a lot of flat spaces too  We had a problem at the end  Flat spots whatever  We're not able  We discussed it earlier  We have an inability here to sit down  And intelligently talk to women  That was pretty much what we learned yesterday  You know when you said that earlier 
[01:27:00]  A bit light went off in my head  I don't know what it is yet  But there's something there  Why you want to actually try it?  Yeah  Like give it a try  With everybody now knowing that we have this inability  Yeah  To have a girl sit down there  And try to carry on a conversation with her  That could be really good  I think yeah  We could line up girls  And they could all dress slutty  Like they're strippers  And then just by talking to them  And the awkwardness  I think you and I will be able to tell  If they're like some kind of like 
[01:27:30]  Professor or scientist  You think that?  I don't know  That's what I'm thinking  See that way though  There's a bit there somewhere  Just them walking in  With those kind of clothes  You would know right?  Well not you would know  But it would make it easier for us to talk  It would kind of ruin it  Because we'd be able to carry on a conversation  We'd go like  Wow you're really hot  Or you know  What do you do?  You just carry on a conversation  But if they come in  And they're like those professional girls  You see walking down the streets of Manhattan  With their smart business attire on  And they sit down  What the hell are you going to say? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah  Want some coffee?  Well we'll throw it in  We'll throw it in the back of our heads  We'll come up with something  Yeah  Because there's definitely something there  Mm-hmm  Because you're 100% right Anthony  James in Indiana  What's up?  How you doing all day?  Pretty good  I just want to tell you guys  Are just fucking awesome first of all  Thank you friend  My girlfriend  I tried to get her to listen to y'all  I've been a fan since you were on the premium  I love that you're on the regular now  I've got it on all three now  Wait are you a fan since we've been off the premium or?  No no no 
[01:28:30]  I paid for you all on the premium  And I paid all of the $2 religiously  Oh cool  What a guy  How'd you find out about us?  Really when I got XM  I mean I'm from the Midwest  And when you all came on XM  I jumped right on it  Cool  And I mean I'd still be paying  If you were still on the premium  But I'm glad you're not  Because now I've got you on all my receivers  Oh cool  Alright James  The funniest thing was  My girlfriend  She can't stay in your guys show  Really?  I listen to you every morning 
[01:29:00]  But it was funny  Because Wednesday  She was in the truck with me  I passed another semi  And that one just  Is just to have  One of your wow stickers on the breather  Yeah  She felt implied just to flashing  Because it was whipping out Wednesday  There you go  Nice  That's why you've got to get the wow stickers  You know  We have a dilemma  As a show  We really do  We know what guys want to hear  From their radio program  But then we do live appearances  And it's just a sausage factory  It's just  So then  Then we get together  And like do we soften our delivery a little bit  Just so we can get just enough girls 
[01:29:30]  To show up to some of these appearances  You know  Not change the show drastically  But just enough  Where we get some more  Hot pieces of asses showing up  Dude they're pussies now man  Dude they've totally watered down the show  I bet Washington told them  They need more women  And if they don't  Calm the show down  Shut up  Dude  I like the fact that we're brutal  Because the women that do show up  You know the type of girls they are  That's right  They're good eggs  Hey listen  I gotta get on the  Look you sit on the toilet  Put the scheme out  I gotta go  Alright  That's what we're looking for 
[01:30:00]  Hey uh  Travis is checking in  Isn't he supposed to be getting us coffee right now  Travis  Travis  Yeah  Hello  Yeah  Go ahead Travis  Yeah as well as I like guys know  We're listening to Montana  This shit's awesome  Thanks man  Montana  You've been listening for what  Two weeks  About two weeks  That's right  See we just knew more than everyone at XM  I gotta tell ya  Yep  We just knew that we needed to be exposed to the entire platform from day one  Take us off the premium and uh 
[01:30:30]  I mean we went over this like last week  I was  I was frustrated in the beginning but I sort of understood  Just because we needed to kind of get back into the flow  But  But man they wasted so much time  I'm telling you  So much time  Now we just have to do our show  Thank you  And watch the people appear  Alright  Watch them appear from the four corners of this grand country  Like magic  Like magic  Exactly  And they are  Like magic  It's magic  It's magic  And they're popping up all over the place now 
[01:31:00]  Hey uh  The Honeymooners  Yeah  I've been taking a peek at this off and on for the last few months  You know  Uh  At first I got really excited  Because they decided to make a Honeymooners movie  And I got excited because I didn't know anything about it  But I just thought Honeymooners movie  Has potential right  And then they decided to go with the black cast  Which I'm like  What?  What kind of gimmick is that?  That has nothing to do with the original Honeymooners  No  You can't be Honeymooners if you're a common law married  The Honeymooners is one of the 
[01:31:30]  Probably  Yeah well Eric's saying the greatest show ever  The greatest sitcom ever  It's definitely  Groundbreaking  It's definitely one of the top five  Right  Sitcom  Best sitcoms of all time  Yeah  So why would you fuck with the formula?  Because Hollywood is filled with uncreative  Cowards  And dummies  None of you are original as your writers  Or maybe it's that the networks have cut your balls off  I don't know what it is  But this is the best you can do  Is redo old TV shows  Yeah  You're shit 
[01:32:00]  All of you  You writers out there  You are shit  And this is what you come up with  This is what you get  You know  Real fascinating  Because I know you got the article in front of you  You know  This trend of making movies out of TV shows  Started I guess with the Brady Bunch  Was that pretty much the first one?  Let me think  I think you're done with other ones right?  Yeah  That was the one that kind of  You know  Put the whole concept on the map  Sitcoms I think you're right  Yeah  Well yeah  That's what I mean  You know  Old TV sitcoms and stuff  And the first Brady Bunch movie 
[01:32:30]  Was really funny  They did a really good job  And then the second one blew  And they were goofing on it  And then it just wrecked the whole franchise  And then  Because of the success of the Brady Bunch  They just started popping these  Movies about old sitcoms out like crazy  Like they're going to have a bewitched one  Bewitched  I know  And Will Ferrell is hilarious  But he's just going to bomb in that movie  I'm sorry to say  They were fun to watch  Way back when  And you know  For nostalgia's sake  Sometimes they pop on now  And you'll turn it on and watch  But  As far as  Making movies about these shows 
[01:33:00]  You know what worked  And I was surprised it worked  I saw it on a plane a couple times  Bits and pieces  Was the Fat Albert movie  Because it was what it was supposed to be  Are you kidding?  No I'm dead serious  Because as a cartoon  It was a cartoon  Don't even look at him seriously  Because I'm going to smack him in the face  I'll tell you what  I actually watched part  There were certain parts  That I thought were fun  I swear to God  He had me at first  But now I'm with you  I know he did  I looked at Ovi and said  He's got him  Did you see it and hate it?  Look I'm going to look at you  Shut up  You're a lying sack of shit  No I'm not 
[01:33:30]  I'm not  You are so lying  No I would say  You know what made me laugh  I know it sounds like  I'm being sarcastic  But I'm going to be honest  You are being sarcastic  Because it was a cartoon  I can understand taking a cartoon  And using that technology  To make like a film  And it was what it was  It was a dumb cartoon  And it was like  That's it  I like when they're all  Walking in a group  There was actually  Parts that were okay  I know it sounds like  I'm full of malarkey  It does sound like it  Because I cannot possibly  Fathom that you  Enjoyed that movie  But it was what it was  It was a cartoon  You know what I mean 
[01:34:00]  There's nothing to really  Change with it  It was like  Let's just see what it  Looked like  Yeah  I know what this is about  Fine  He wants  There's a connection there  There's some kind of connection  No not at all  His manager  Had a lot to do with  The movie  There's something there  The director of that movie  Now has a project  Right  Has some kind of project  Okay Jim  I have no idea  You're changing my friend  Slowly but surely  I swear to God  But your buddies  Opie and Anthony  Are taking notice  I didn't  No because I refused  To audition for the honeymoon  They asked me to audition  For like some small  Do you like Robin Williams 
[01:34:30]  Robin Williams yes  One of the only celebrities  That would be nice to me  Yes  He's a sweet guy  Didn't say anything  About his actor  You know what  Me and Colin went downstairs  One time to the comedy cellar  We were like  We were going to go down there  Just watch and go  Ugh  And it was  And Colin even said  It was fucking brilliant  He did 45 minutes  It was all topical shit  I mean the guy is brilliant  When he wants to be brilliant  Yeah  Yeah I mean we watched him  And we went down there  Specifically  First time he came to the cellar  Just to go  Ugh  Did he grab a tablecloth  Off one of the tables  And make like a gay scarf with it  No he didn't  And kind of walk around the stage 
[01:35:00]  Doing the gay thing  Because that's just hysterical  Yeah I know that's something  Do you like  That's a prop  Do you like Billy Crystal  Not really  I mean I don't hate him  But I didn't like him  He was really rude to me  And it annoyed me  So your likes or dislikes  Are based pretty much  On personal things  And how they treated you  Sometimes  Yeah I'm not a fan  Of his movies  I don't hate them  I mean like  They're irrelevant to me  I don't watch them  And I don't  You know kill myself  If they're on  Whatever  Alright  So the Honeymooners movie  Yeah  We have  Cedric the Entertainer  Is playing Ralph Cramden 
[01:35:30]  And he's got a couple of quotes  In Entertainment Weekly  The summer preview issue  Movie preview  Cedric  Said he never  He had never really seen  Jackie Gleason  In the Honeymooners  Until after he was cast  As Ralph Cramden  In the film  Now is this like  Some kind of line of crap  That he's given  To say you know  I wasn't influenced by it  Is there a human being  That  How did you avoid  The Honeymooners  Especially in entertainment  Well especially  The guy's got to be  In his 40's right 
[01:36:00]  Yeah  How did he avoid  Not seeing the Honeymooners  His whole life  Being a comedian  Because I remember  As a kid watching  Gleason's variety show  When he had the girls  And the cigarettes  Big Daddy Smooth  Cedric recalls  He says he didn't want  To impersonate Gleason  As much as capture  Ralph's disposition  But he couldn't rely  Too heavily on  Cramden's signature  To the moon Alice  And then he's quoted  As saying  It's not politically correct  To talk about  Whopping your wife 
[01:36:30]  Nowadays  There you go  There you go Hollywood  That's exactly what you are  That's what you are  In that sentence  So you can't have it  Both ways in Hollywood  You can't make these  Comedies  And try to be  Politically correct  There was nothing  Politically correct  About the Honeymooners  Right  You can't do it  It doesn't work  Time and time again  These movies just  Completely fail  Because they're worried  About who they're  Going to offend  It just doesn't  Work that way  Why was  Something about Mary  Such a smash  Hundred million dollar hit 
[01:37:00]  They goofed on  Retard  She had a load  In her hair  He got his dick  Caught in his zipper  A dog bit his dick  Right  It was vicious  And it was funny  You fucking idiots  They're all a bunch  Of these  Politically correct  Cowards  So now you're  Going to get a movie  You're going to get  The Honeymooners movie  With a black cast  Which you know  I just don't understand  I don't understand  Why that decision  Was made  If you're going to  Remake the show  It's a gimmick  Were they going for  Some gimmick thing 
[01:37:30]  But that show  Is so brilliant  You just redo  The whole thing  With some interesting  Actors  And it would be a hit  In my opinion  Some new situations  If you want to  Change it around  A little bit  Right  Have the same  Type of characters  Yeah  That movie will get  A half a star  You watch  You watch  And the contrast  Anthony  We were just talking  To the gang  From Family Guy  Yesterday  You saw the clip  Got to give it away  A little bit  In the new episode  That's running  Sunday night  They do a cutaway  To the Honeymooners  That exact scene  Yeah  Where you know  He's saying 
[01:38:00]  To the moon Alice  To the moon Alice  And she opens up  A yap to say something  And he punches  A square in the face  And knocks her out cold  Lays her out on the floor  Now that's funny  Hilarious  That's god damn funny  And that is the difference  That's why Family Guy  Will continue to be successful  And this movie will bomb  And why is it  That with the violence  They're making in films  Or the cop dramas  Why is it acceptable  You can show domestic violence  In a dramatic situation  Yeah  I'm so sick of the  Fucking little dotted line  They put for comedy  And where you can't cross  It's revolting  In comedy  Because there's no place 
[01:38:30]  For that in comedy  Because they don't see it  As an art  They don't see it as an art  They see it as a bunch  Of fucking clowns  With red noses  Shit heads  Well  The black cast  I don't get it  It's going to be  The Honeymooners  It's going to be  A beloved character  From days gone by  Ralph Cramden  And it's not going to be  Ralph Cramden  Because he's going to  Black it up  You know  It's going to be  It's going to be all ghetto  Jive talking  Shucking in a jiving  You know  With his buddy  What's he going to go up to 
[01:39:00]  I mean  He's going to go up to Norton  And they're going to  Talk ghetto to each other  Is that going to  Anyone else notice  Because we're talking  About movies here  That there's just no movies  You're dying to see anymore  Nope  What is going on?  Hollywood stinks  Lately I've been wanting to  You know  Especially this winter  Was just awful in New York  And you know  The spring we've had  A few rainy days  And it's perfect days  And perfect weather  To go to the movies  I go  I read the paper  And I'm going through  The movie listings  And there's just nothing  I want to see 
[01:39:30]  Star Wars  No  Star Wars  Well those movies  Aren't out yet  Kevin Smith said  Fucking awesome  For Star Wars  Yeah  And Kevin Smith  Is a huge Star Wars fan  And critic  He thought the last two  That were made  Really blew ass  And he saw this one  And said it's amazing  So hopefully  Lucas got it right  This time  But week after week  The new movies come out  And they get one  That awful two stars  Which means you don't know  If it's good or bad  You know this new 
[01:40:00]  Triple X movie  State of the Union  If Vin Diesel  Turned it down  With Ice Cube  Got one star  That was an automatic  Payday for Vin Diesel  Walk in  Walk through your lines  And here's a huge check  I'm sure  And he turned it down  And he turned it down  It's getting horrendous reviews  It's just mediocre garbage  I mean that is all  That they are  I want to see Hitchhiker's Guide  I do too  Yeah  Yeah that's got  They got  That got three stars  So  That looks pretty funny  Better than the original  One  Who's in that  What's his name 
[01:40:30]  But I even  Who's in Galaxy Quest  I got rooked into  See Fever Pitch  And that movie was awful  How did you get  Rooked into seeing that  That's maybe  If you're in a hotel  And you've seen  Everything else  In the new releases  Still in theaters  In the hotel  Yeah  It was a rainy day  And it was  It was there  And it was starting soon  Sam Rockwell  That's who's in it  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Look I just went through  The whole movie  There's nothing  There's not a movie  I want to see this weekend 
[01:41:00]  Nothing  Well someone suggested  The Batman  That's coming out  Looks like it's going to be pretty good  Someone suggested the  Where is it  That looks like a lemon  The Longest Yard  Remake of The Longest Yard  Yeah  Stop  All those remakes  Remakes  Another one I didn't audition for  Really?  The Chris Rock Adam Sandler film  No  No  No  It's going to be a bomb right  I don't know  I mean  Sandler's films are so successful  Do we need a Jiminy Glick movie?  No  Are you kidding me?  No  Jiminy Glick and La La Wood  Sandler's quickly losing his 
[01:41:30]  What dude?  Spanglish?  Yeah  Like I respect  Again Robin Williams is a bad example  But he's a guy who can really act  Like he's a Juilliard trained actor  He's not just a stand up  Who thinks  Alright now fuck it I'll act  He's a real actor  Jim Carrey made a run at some serious stuff  But it was a hard translation for him to make  I mean  Jim Carrey's doing pretty well  I like Jim Carrey  But I mean  It's just  He's playing some weird roles  But he's pulling it off  Yeah  He doesn't take the typical  But it's just people don't really take him serious  Adam Sandler  Yeah  I mean 
[01:42:00]  The Happy Gilmore stuff  I mean a 2019 film  That's great  Stick to that  Dramatic roles  Hey I love you  How do you follow the longest you are?  They have to realize  There are certain things  That they cannot  Top  You're not going to top  The Longest Yard  The Honeymooners is too famous  It's too well known  You can't top that  Yeah  Leave it as it is  Leave it alone  You want to remake an obscure film  Like Tarantino  Kind of  You know  Remake certain John Woo  That's weird  That's doable  What like the 
[01:42:30]  Like all the camera work and shit  All the angle  That's all John Woo stuff  You know  All the reservoir dogs  All that stuff is old John Woo camera  Yeah  That's all  Yeah  I mean that type of stuff  You can get away with  Yeah but not directly  Just taking crap  No  This old crappy movie remakes  TV show remakes  It's just ridiculous  Do you remember when they redid  All in the Family  In the early 90's  It's called 704 Hauser Street  It was the same house  Same set  But they moved a black family in there  Oh right  He was John Amos from Good Times 
[01:43:00]  He was the black Archie Bunker  Lasted like a couple months  And cancelled  Nobody watched it  I thought that was going to be a good idea  Yeah exactly  I tell you  The same no talent  Fucking not qualified for his job  Studio scumbag  That greenlit a lot of this crap  They're idiots  They're people who wanted to make it in the business  You didn't have the talent  Now you're in a position of power  Yeah  You didn't make it in the business  Because your judgment stinks  You don't have it  Your judgment still stinks  You know who makes great judgments  Fucking Weinstein  Yeah 
[01:43:30]  Over at Miramax  Those guys are fucking great  Of course  Stupid Disney doesn't want anything to do with them anymore  Got a deal going with those guys  What's that?  Got a deal going with those guys  Never met them  I actually  I went to the Seinfeld comedian premiere  When that happened  And Harvey Weinstein  I didn't know  Recognize him at first  I didn't know who he was  Like I knew his name  And I see this big fat fucking guy  Smoking in a restaurant with Seinfeld  I'm like  He's somebody  Because Seinfeld notoriously hates cigarettes  And this motherfucker  Would have flicked an ash in Jerry's face  And not care  But those guys do nothing  But give like good movies 
[01:44:00]  And of course  Disney wants to distance themselves  Shit  It's just a disaster lately  You go to Blockbuster  The new releases  And you're just  Combing those long walls  Forever  I haven't been to Blockbuster  I haven't been to Blockbuster  I'm trying to find one stupid movie to watch  Years I haven't been to Blockbuster  Probably two years  Just buy the DVDs now  Now I just buy them  Ugh  Screw it  Might as well have  Because anything that I don't want to own  I pretty much don't want to see  Or I could just see it on TV  Once  I like  I don't care  Or I get it from Danny 
[01:44:30]  And don't return it  Yeah  That's pretty much what I do  Well the movie ticket prices  Are so ridiculous  In New York  You might as well buy the DVD  Wait a little longer  You know  If it's a movie you don't really need  To see right away  And have Steve illegally download it  And burn it  Tell me about it  Steve doesn't do that  That's what he does  Of course he doesn't  No no no Steve uploads  Man my family enjoyed that Incredibles movie  Three months before it hit Blockbuster  Thank you Steve  Yeah  Of course he had nothing to do with it  It's all about jokes on this show  I don't ever download things illegally 
[01:45:00]  I wouldn't do it  I read the synopsis  And I move on  Pete from Queens  What's up?  Hey  Going back to that  Politically correctness  To the old sitcoms  I recall Happy Days  When  Howie Cunningham  Had his old army buddy walk in  And he was black  And everybody flips out  Marion flips out  You know  She's wondering what the neighbors think  Oh that was a special episode  Oh wasn't the black character  On Happy Days named Sticks?  Wasn't it Sticks?  No Stacks  And he forgot to 
[01:45:30]  Stacks  And he fell asleep  And got shot  They had to kill him  Yes Sticks  I think it was Sticks right?  Sticks was going to have a wedding  I think it was  And they had no place to have it  So they had it in the Cunningham house  Even the cartoons of the old days  I mean remember the Jets  Did you ever see any black people on Jetsons?  Oh here's the  Here comes the line  Hold on to your hats people  Hold on  Don't you try to wiggle out of this  No  I don't remember seeing any blacks on the Jetsons sir  Well you see how bright the future is then? 
[01:46:00]  Wow  That was a spacecraft crashing  Let's go to Jamie  What's up Jamie?  Yeah I was just going to say  It's actually brilliant  To put the black cats in the Honeymooners  Why is that?  Well because how else would they get by with  Smacking your bitches up  And doing all that kind of stuff  No but  That's mainstream culture now  They're not doing it bro  Yeah but that's the point  They don't believe in the whole violence angle  That the Honeymooners had  So you won't see any of that stuff 
[01:46:30]  Instead of seeing beyond the dumb lines  Which was that it was a loving relationship  And she was the boss  She was one of the first dominant  Hilarious women on television  She never lost to that idiot Ralph  She was the boss  But she wasn't a career woman  But I guarantee in the black Honeymooners  You watch  She's got a job  Absolutely  She's going to have a much better job  Than Cedric  Who will definitely be the bus driver  Is it true that the black guy playing Norton 
[01:47:00]  Gets shot out on the fire escape  While he's sleepwalking  Trying to get through windows  It's Mike Epps  Who's playing him  Mike he's a funny comic man  Is he yeah  Yeah Mike he's been in all those  Friday movies and stuff like that  Oh yeah yeah okay  He's a good stand up  He's a really character driven  Is he really like ghetto  Yeah  Yeah so he's going to be like  Real ghetto Norton  I don't know  Whatever they tell him to do as an actor  I mean I don't know what they want  The role of him  But you know  Mike's a funny dude  Let's go to Jay  Hey Jay  I don't know how they're getting around  The fact that 
[01:47:30]  The old white Honeymooners  They actually worked  There's a funny scene too  In the opening where Cedric goes  Yo get that retard bitch off the bus  Hey Jay what's up  Hey how you doing guys  Hey sweetie  Hi  Hi  Listen  Talking about all these remakes  What about Vin Rames  On Kojak  Yeah he's going to be the black Kojak  That's right  It's a TV series  It's already running  Oh it is running

[01:49:00]  That's what it was  It was a typo  Oh god  Racist  Jesus Christ  Are you talking to yourself there  You know what  That was kind of cute  Boy you really went for the whole enchilada  Was there a black odd couple back in the 80s  I do kind of remember that  Stop  I do remember that  They did the odd couple  And made the characters black  Oh so this idea is not even original  To make them black characters instead of white 
[01:49:30]  Yeah just so the black audience will come out  Because black people go out  Their movies always do well  Because they're  You know  They feel crazy  Crazy  You look fantastic  You look really well  Thanks  I was going to say that your  Look great too  Thank you  Particularly today  Just a quickie  What was that?  That's Sally  Philip Seymour Hoffman  Robert Downey Jr. tells some British talk show hosts  She has nice tits  Oh there was a black odd couple?  Yeah  Hold on hold on buddy  Go on now  Felix Unger was played by Ron Glass from Barney Miller  Wow  Wow 
[01:50:00]  Hey  And who was Oscar?  Someone named Demond Wilson  Demond Wilson  Was he in the  That's dummy  Yeah  From Sanford and Son  His son Demond Wilson  The Arthur Ashe Oscar is such a mess  He leaves his AZT and T-cells all over the house  Oscar, Oscar, Oscar  There's a tennis racket with blood on it  Oscar, let me wash that robe  Let me just wash it 
[01:50:30]  It's so stained  It's so soiled in the back  You're not dying, Felix  You're killing everyone around you  Let's go to Kevin in Buffalo  Kevin  Hey, what's going on boys?  Hi Kevin  How are you Kevin?  Hi sweetie  Hi  Hey, the guy that played Styx Cunningham  He was a drummer in Richie's band for a while  Yeah, there's a couple different black guys on the happy days  Right, but the guy that played Styx ended up in porno movies afterwards 
[01:51:00]  Oh really?  Yep  I can't remember his real name  But you guys might be able to check that out farther  Alright, thank you  We'll get right on that  And we all know the big thing about Chuck not being there for the second season  But was that ever explained by the producers that somebody knows?  I think they just never had a storyline for him  It was always about Richie and his friends  And he was so rarely on camera that they figured they'd just send him off to college 
[01:51:30]  And never have him on the show  But they would say, I have two kids  They like made him cease to exist  Yeah  They never explained why they made him cease to exist  No  It was terrible writing  And there were two Chuck Cunninghams, by the way  Wow  We learned that during the reunion special  Oh, hold on the info we got from that  Or a couple months ago  The dude from Jersey, Big Black Kojak, cries every fucking week  So I guess he's more of an emotional Kojak than Telly Savalas was  But I did see an episode and it's... 
[01:52:00]  I don't know why they call it Kojak  It might as well just be a new cop show with Ving Rhimes  Because I have no idea  It has nothing to do with Kojak  The character names are the same, you know  Like, hey, Krucker, you know  But he wears the hat, has a lollipop  Because they just don't have confidence in their stuff in Hollywood  Yeah  They shouldn't in a lot of it  They should have him with a ball gag getting railed up the ass in a room by some hillbilly  I'm about to get medieval on you, baby  Baby  Did you see who's kissing Katie Holmes? 
[01:52:30]  Ah, yes  What do you think that's about?  There's been rumors about Tom Hanks forever  Tom Hanks?  Well, what does Tom Cruise have?  I mean Tom Cruise, I'm sorry  Jesus, Tom Cruise  Tom Hanks, where did that come from?  Tom Cruise  Tom Cruise  Is now with Katie Holmes  You know something, though?  All the rumors and stuff  I used to hop on that bandwagon  I just don't see  I haven't seen any evidence that this guy is gay  None  I've seen him just railing some of the hottest chicks in Hollywood  You gotta give the guy his due 
[01:53:00]  It's wishful thinking on men's part  Because he's so good-looking  He's everything all of us want to be  He's a handsome, talented guy who bangs tens  We all want him to be gay  Like, something's gotta be wrong  Please, right  Something be wrong  Be a gay guy  Be tortured as you're kissing her  He's 42  Is he?  Depressing, right?  Tom Cruise is 42  Fuck, I'm old too, man  Well, he's got himself  And she's 26  Prime  Very nice  16 year difference  I like that  Who doesn't? 
[01:53:30]  Um, alright  16, 18, whatever  Whatever  Um  But if it works, it works, right?  Good point  You know, people are people  When you really get down to it  What does age really matter?  Other than a number  And an addition of life experience  That's it  Who cares if you're as old as her parents? 
[01:54:00]  That's right  Even if you met when you were 24  And she was however old  That would be six  I like that  Alright, let's go to Cliff in Oklahoma  Six  Hi boys  Do the math  Jesus  Hi boys  Hi Cliff  What's up Cliff?

[01:56:30]  Ten times better  And I'm glad  I'm not even going to even switch  I'm definitely staying with XM  I'm definitely hooked on you guys  Thank you sir  That Rosie O'Donnell bit  I was pissing my pants  You know here's the difference too  You can listen to a bit like that  On our show  Or you can tune in to him  And he'll  He'll bitch and complain  How he can't do a show anymore  Because Bush has it out for him  I mean  Yeah  He's always complaining  That oh I created this  And they copied that  That's such bullshit  Well I got an example 
[01:57:00]  On Monday show I think  I got to find an old tape  That'll just make for a funny bit  I invented a carbon paper  Robert  Which is really ironic  If you think about it  Because then people  Could copy other people  I invented  I am actually considering  The satellite radio option  I'll go to whatever network  Doesn't have opium anthony  Okay  Yeah that'll turn out to be 
[01:57:30]  A wise choice  You idiot  Eeny meeny miny  Hoohoo  Alright let's go to break  What the hell here  Like sand  Through the hourglass  So is the only day of life  Ross is coming in today  And I think he was the one  As we're all leaving last night  Finally at  I don't know  Like 12  1230  Whatever it was  He's like  Don't forget to  Don't let Jimmy off the hook  He was blowing kisses  To the audience  Did you blow kisses

[02:01:30]  Top let's go to  Mr. Skin  And then  Best ex  He ever had  Best ex  He ever had  Michael Jackson's  You know  Chick there  Debbie  Or  Debbie Rowe  Whatever the hell  Her name was  Fat broad  Basically saying  That he is a really  Nice guy  And a nice father  Blah blah blah  And that there's  Vultures hanging around him  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  Vultures  Nothing's happening  To Michael Jackson  He'll walk  He'll definitely walk  And then the other  Paper has  Bush Benz 
[02:02:00]  On social  Social security  Did you watch  His speech last night  A couple minutes  Did you watch  Any of it  Do we have audio  Of that  I don't know  I don't know  I watched it  Yeah  You can't  I got a lot of  Problems with  George Bush  His  Presidency  Over the years  A lot of problems  I have a problem  With him too  That he's now  Holding men's hands  Yeah that was a little  Rough to watch  The whole homoerotic  Culture makes me  Nauseous 
[02:02:30]  To faggots  Hold my hand  As we walk  It's like  Don't you know  This fucking press here  Two men in the garden  Pictures of this  In the garden  As we walk  Hand in hand  You're the president  Of a nuclear superpower  Can't you go  Hey fuckhead  We're doing this  Our way  We're not holding hands  And canoodling  Fruit holding hands  You think President Bush  Has a circle of friends  Like you know  We have  Where behind the scenes  Hey faggot  They're just  Fucking with him  So bad  You think like  Rumsfeld  Before they walk  Out of the  The oval office goes 
[02:03:00]  You want to hold hands  Yeah exactly  Get the fuck out of here  You got a thing  I don't care who you are  Yeah  On this planet  You got that group of friends  That is  They're just going to  Mess with you  No matter what  I believe that  You know  They probably have like  They're making  T-shirts and stuff  For behind the scenes  You know  Oh  Bush doesn't like Bush  Oh look at him  Holding hands  With a man  Ugh  I watched some of it  Last night  Yeah  And for all the fault 
[02:03:30]  That the Democrats  Are laying on him  About this social security  Thing  I have not heard  One viable solution  That they've come up with  They say  Like Bush came up  With this thing  He said  Social security  Is going broke  The old people now  Are getting their money  They'll continue  To get their money  A couple of generations  Down the line  As far as grandchildren  Are concerned  There's a real problem here  The money's just  Going to run out  There's just too many  Older people  That are living longer  And it's just  The money's running out  You can't 
[02:04:00]  You can't  Support the older people  On what  The people that are  Working at any given moment  Are contributing  Mathematically  Doesn't work out  Something has to be done  So George W  Comes up with this plan  To privatize it a bit  To take some of this money  That you normally just  Comes out of your check  And goes into social security  You see it every week  And instead  Your money  That is taken out  Can be invested  Not invested  In dot coms  Or something  But a very diverse  Portfolio  Of bonds  And stocks 
[02:04:30]  And that way  It earns money  And by the time  You retire  You'll have  A little nest egg  For yourself  A retirement fund  It's one of the  It's one of the only ideas  I'm hearing  The Democrats  Then come out  And go  This is horrible  All this is going to do  Is make more money  For wall street  Because of fees  This is setting up  Retirees  For disaster  If the market crashes  This  But not one idea  Bush is an idiot  For coming up with this 
[02:05:00]  Not one alternative idea  Besides  Well  Let's raise the taxes  Let's then just take  More money out  For social security  And before you know it  Your whole check  Will be gone  Well the answer  I think  The solution  Is very simple  When somebody  Has to be a certain age  You  If you see the end  Of one flow  Over the cuckoo's nest  You have a big Indian  Put a pillow  Over their burdened face  And hold it  Their burdensome heads  You know  That is an option 
[02:05:30]  I haven't heard that one  And I say  We kill the elderly  You say elderly  The elderly  That's fine  The nuclear elderly  It is sick you know  That these old people  Have to deal with this crap  I mean look  In fairness  Old people  Earn their right  To relax and shit  Most of them  Have busted their ass  To do all this stuff  Their whole lives  And it's like  We can't take care of them  We're sickening  Yeah  Did you hear what happened  To her speech last night  What  Oh it's not like  The old days  This is  I mean  You know  The TV time  Is getting way too important  Oh right  And the network  May sweeps just started 
[02:06:00]  May sweeps have started  We're going to have  Someone coming in  Talking about May sweeps  As a matter of fact  And it's just way too important  To give up all that time  For another dumb speech  By the president  Yeah  So the White House  Learned a painful media lesson  Thursday  Do not launch a press conference  On the final night  Of  Final night  First night of May sweeps  CBS  NBC and Fox  Cut off President Bush  Mid-sentence  In several time zones  After sacrificing  One hour of prime  The president was left  Standing on the stage  As NBC rushed  To Donald Trump  Fox to Paris Hilton  And CBS to Survivor 
[02:06:30]  Wow  All those networks  Saying no  These shows are so much  More important  Than what the president  Has to say  Wow  That is something  I guess it was only  ABC and PBS  Stayed with him  To the end  Sensing he was running  Into trouble  Bush joked  We better finish this up  There are TV programs  To show for the sake  Of the economy  But it was too late  They were already gone  Oh that's that conservative  News organization  Yeah yeah  They had done the same thing  To Clinton  Yeah  Or if Kerry was president  They did the exact same thing  Yeah  And if one person  Calls and said 
[02:07:00]  Hey the companies  Are owned by conservatives  I'll bite your ear off  And spit it in your face  They don't make  The day to day decisions  Stupid  Yeah  That's exactly  The case  They cut him off  One defense  They do have  Is the  All 24 hour  News organizations  That are out there  Fox News  And CNN  Are well equipped  To cover the entire thing  They do  Who doesn't have it  These days  If you're still  Jockeying around  A set of rabbit ears  On your television 
[02:07:30]  You really don't have  A voice in this country  I was going to say  What the president  Has to say  Doesn't concern you  The contribution  You're making  Is really nothing  So shut up  He doesn't care about you  He doesn't care about you  Just watch Paris Hilton  Oh the democrats do  But yeah  But yeah  President Bush  Doesn't care  Then again  Fox cut out too  And Fox is pretty conservative  They're new  Yeah true  But they have Fox News  You know  So it's like  Obviously  It was an economical decision  More than a political one  Oh yeah absolutely  They figured  What the hell  Let's put on our shows  If people want to watch 
[02:08:00]  They go to Fox News  Still getting the viewers  You guys heard what  Randy Rhodes did  On her show huh  Yes  We have Air America  Here on XM Satellite Radio  And she got in a lot of trouble  I don't agree with what  She has to say  For the most part  But she does a good job  With her show  Really  Yeah I heard it  I enjoy listening  She knows how to keep  A talk show  Rolling right along  Huh  She's out of Florida  I thought she was out of New York  Is she out of Florida  She's out of West Palm Beach  Yeah  In some trouble now  With the Secret Service though  Yeah I can't get the  Eric we might have a bad CD here though 
[02:08:30]  Eric fix that CD  See what you can do  Chop chop  Basically government officials  Are reviewing a skit  Which aired on the network  Monday evening  A skit featuring  An apparent gunshot  Warning to the president  Gunshot warning to the president  You can't threaten  The president's life ever  No  Whether you're a wacky  You know radio DJ  Or some psychopath  You can't do it  But does that constitute  A threat  Well that's what  See that's the whole thing  I don't think it does  At all  I mean you can't 
[02:09:00]  Screw around with it  You can't  See there's a difference  Between parody  Like that was  A skit  A fictitious skit  On the radio  Being parody  And people saying  That it's illegal  To threaten the president  Even in joking  Now there's a difference  What they mean by  In joking  Is you can't  Write a gag letter  Saying that you're  Going to do harm  To the president  And send it out  And say it was a joke  That's the joke  That they say  You can't do  But in some type of 
[02:09:30]  Parody sketch  I think it's  It's totally legal  I don't know  You guys might not  Have heard  But John Malkovich  Was arrested this week  For the role he played  When he was trying  To assassinate the president  Many years ago  Oh there you go  And I don't know  I also heard  Gary Oldman  Is being brought in  For questioning  Because he portrayed  Lee Harvey Oswald  Oh I forgot  Once again  The same rule  Doesn't apply  To actors  As it does  To anything  In a comedic sense  Yeah and I never  Got that  You know  I never have  Gotten that  That point  I don't understand 
[02:10:00]  How you know  Society takes  Radio guys  More seriously  Like everything  That is said  On the radio  As a radio host  Is real  We mean it  Right  And it's  There can never be  Any sarcasm  Drama  Anything like that  Acting  Acting  It's all gotta be real  Things done in character  Right  You know it's all  Anything that comes out  Of the radio is real  But you do it  In a movie setting  It's fine  Yeah  Didn't the secret service  So they really weren't  Investigating  This might have been  A little bit blown out  By America  America too 
[02:10:30]  Like  Well why not  To get some nice  Publicity out of it  I didn't like the way  I understand that  She shouldn't go to jail  For it  But I didn't like  The way she's like  Well if I have to be punished  Then I have to be punished  Shut up  I'll take one for the team  You're not going to jail  Stupid  Everybody knows what it was  And stop denying  That you were part of it  I didn't highlight this part  Where she's saying  That I had nothing to do  With the bit  There was something  Oh yeah  We were talking about that yesterday  Well basically  I got some stuff here  She says  She's not afraid  Of being prosecuted  Over the matter  This was just a stupid 
[02:11:00]  Stupid bit  She explained  On yesterday's broadcast  On the Air America  Network  But if it crossed the line  Then certainly  There must be punishment  And if there is  I want to be punished  So that I can actually say  Equal justice  Under the law  Anybody that has  Stepped over the line  Of law  Needs to be prosecuted  Including me  Rhodes maintains  The skit was created  By producers  A bullet right through  His head  At Air America  Without her knowledge  And she would not have 
[02:11:30]  Aired it  If she had heard it  In advance  I hear Rick Delgado  Was fired  And didn't even work there  Poor Rick  It's amazing  The government  The government is saying  Even joking about  Shooting the president  Is a crime  Let alone doing it  On national radio  Right  Joking  We are taking this  Very seriously  I did  I actually did  A little research  And popped up online  The actual laws  To threatening  The president  And it's  What?  Forget Aristotle  And fuck Socrates 
[02:12:00]  Here comes  Professor Anthony  What is wrong with you?  Well I was wondering  I was very curious  This is what amazes me  I was thinking about  What you were talking about yesterday  You're spending  Eight hours a day  Playing poker online  Video poker  So I was starting to think  When does this guy have time?  During the time I play poker  Like I have  I have two computers  So you were done with poker  And said  I gotta look up some laws now  No no  As the poker is on one computer  On the other computer  During the whole time 
[02:12:30]  I play poker  I forgot you had that  The other computer is running  So during the whole time  I'm playing poker  You don't have to  Totally concentrate  Playing poker the whole time  Most of the time you spend  It's folding your hand  Okay  And while they're playing  Then I'm on the other computer  And I'm  Getting knowledge  Getting knowledge  I'm doing things  I think you do that  Because that little knowledge  Is your only connection  To sanity left  You feel yourself spiraling  Into a bedridden  Gambling  Destituting distance  And you're like  I have to just do  Something else healthy  While I'm here  Bedridden  I'm just laying in bed 
[02:13:00]  With a laptop  Shitting into a baggie  No germs  Oh my god  You bring up  Something yesterday  I almost got to the point  Where I was going to  Start laughing at myself  And maybe even crying  Because I was in the middle  Of a tournament  Playing poker  Online  And I really had to  Take a dump  Bad  And I had just  Started playing  I actually considered  Seriously considered  Going into the bedroom  Logging on  Grabbing the laptop  And sitting on the ball 
[02:13:30]  Taking a dump  So I could still play  Alright  I just breathed  A sigh of relief  Why what?  You thought I dumped  My pants?  I'm like alright  He's not going too crazy yet  I was waiting for  Just a  Something much worse  Oh yeah  You don't think  Sitting on the ball  Not being able to  Not play  While I'm taking a crap  And let me  I can understand  And I'm not even  Addicted to the video  Poker online  But you're in  Probably a $200 room  And you know  A $50  $50 room  And you don't want  You know  You're in the middle  Of the tournament 
[02:14:00]  I can understand that  I thought you were  Going to say  I will  And I saw the wastebasket  That's what I put  Next to the computer  And I'm like  And I was considering  For a moment  Taking a dump  And  Well that's right  No  Who else thought  He was going that way  Exactly where I thought  He was going  I got computers  All over the house  Taking a laptop  To the bathroom  Yeah that's nothing  We can do it  I might do it then  I don't know  We could be Tom Likas  And we could do a whole hour  On that if you like  Come on  No  That's what Likas does  Oh he's terrific 
[02:14:30]  That guy tells women  Let's take some calls  Laptop in the bathroom  Likas  Yeah he does  Bob on a cell phone  You're on with Tom Likas  He does four hours  And each hour is one subject  I like that about Likas  Not boring at all  Let's talk about  Throwing your wife  Into the fireplace  During a Christmas party  The laptops get nice and hot  Do you want that hot laptop bottom  On your bare knees  While you're firing a log  Oh you know  The heat from the laptop  Would be rising up  Into your face  And it would be  Clutching the aroma  From the ball  But then you've got to 
[02:15:00]  Stand up  With your left hand  You have to hold  The laptop  And you have to  Wipe with your right hand  Because you can't put  What are you going to do  With the laptop  No I would be able  To lean up  And probably put it  On the bathroom counter  On by the sink  Okay  Put it up there  And then take care  Of business  By the way  Thanks for the  Baby wipe tip  Oh have you picked them up  I sure did  Aren't they wonderful  I had no idea  They got the word  Baby off them  And you don't look  Ridiculous  Now they're just  Regular like  Maybe aloe or something  They're very cool 
[02:15:30]  I got the aloe one  You take them out  And they're very cool  They kind of  Woo  You get a little tickle  It's wonderful  I like to  When I take one of those  I will wrap one around  My finger and cram it in there  Until it comes out clear  Like completely clean  I know  We've discussed that  I know  That's just  Clean  I don't get it  Jimmy's colon's like a rifle bore  It's just completely  You can see reflections  On the side of it  It's amazing  That's ridiculous  I don't know  I just like to be clean  Like my apartment  You know  It's clean except for one room  And I throw all the dirty crap 
[02:16:00]  In that one room  And guess what  Close the door  You don't know what's going on  Behind that door  No one even sees it  Right  Same with the  You know  The back door there  Just make sure you got the door  Just the door's got to be clean  Right  You don't understand though  I get a lot of impromptu ass eatings  No one's going in there  Right Ope  Impromptu  Oh well see  People are using his door  They're actually opening it up  I have a lot of company  Mine's a lot of company  Mine's just a storage facility  I'm not having visitors  No one's visiting 
[02:16:30]  People even ask  What's behind that door  Ah you don't want to know  You don't want to know  Right  Keep it locked  Keep it locked  See I'm just a difference  I'll say why don't you open it  Stick your tongue out  And take a look  Why don't you investigate that room  There we are  Investigate that room  No  No  No  Use the wipe  Keep your underwear all nice  Isn't that bad for you though  To use those wipes  After a while  I mean I know women  A lot of strippers use it  Like after they pee  They do  But it's supposed to dry you out  I guess in your ass it's okay  But I heard that they do  There's like  We're not going in our ass 
[02:17:00]  I've not had a problem  No just between the cheeks  We're just cleaning the doorway  I've not had a problem  With those  They're wonderful  Yeah I got it  Thanks for the time  No cranky ass  Oh  It's great  You have a hairy crack  No  You know  I'm not a hairy for an Italian guy  I'm really not  Light wispy  Ooh  It's like an Asian boy  Ooh  Alright we got some problems  On the phones  We gotta  Oh problem  Oh no  We gotta work out some issues here  Scott in Oklahoma  Hey guys what's going on 
[02:17:30]  What's up Scott  Hey there little fuck face  Hi Scott  Let's watch the language please  Hey let me first say man  I'm a huge fucking fan  I'll never quit listening to you  And I think Anthony  Is probably no offense  Opie you're great too  But Anthony I think you're one of the  Fucking best talents  On radio today  Oh thank you sir  But  Terrestrial or satellite  Uh oh  And uh  I just  For the political views guys  Jesus Christ  I mean you're  Earlier you were talking about  Social security  Democrats  Didn't have a plan  You need to watch something 
[02:18:00]  Other than Fox  No no  Believe me  Harry Reid  The house  The house and the Senate  Both have come out  With plans of social security  And what's their plan?  To raise the  The minute  You know  After you make more than  Ninety thousand dollars  In the year  You quit paying into it  They want to raise it  To one hundred fifty thousand dollars  That's what I said  My friend  I said their plan  Is to raise taxes  To raise the rate  That you have to put  Into social security  That's not an answer  It solves it  Until the year  Two thousand ninety five  No  It's not solving it 
[02:18:30]  It's putting more  Of a tax burden  On the American public  No no no  It's putting more  Of a tax burden  On the rich  Two percent  Rich  Let me tell you  If I got to pay four percent  When I make a year  Why should not  Somebody who  It should be across the board  Scott  What's the  What's the  What's the pay rate  Of the people  That are going to be taxed  How much?  For  Ninety thousand dollars  Ninety thousand  Let me tell you something  And that's per household  Right?  No  That's individually 
[02:19:00]  Pay  Individual  Ninety thousand  First of all  Ninety thousand  Isn't rich anymore  In this country  You're doing all right  You're doing all right  But it's not  You're not  Driving around  In luxury automobiles  In a big house  People have this misconception  That that's  The rich American  It's not  You're not  You're not  You're penalizing  People  In this country  The Democrats  Want  The Democrats  Want to penalize 
[02:19:30]  The people  That have  Actually attained  Some type  Of American dream  Is this Tom?  Is this Tom?  Tom  Are you Tom?  Scott  I'm sorry  Scott  I know what you're saying  About the percentage  But here's my problem  What you're saying  Like there was a thing  For regular taxes  Seventeen percent  Across the board  Rich poor  Everyone pays  Seventeen percent  Was a suggestion  By Forbes years ago  I agree  I like the flat rate  Let me finish  I'm saying  In principle  I agree with that  If you make  Ten million  You pay whatever that is  If you make  Fifty thousand  You pay seventeen percent 
[02:20:00]  Of that  But the more money  You make  The higher percentage  You're paying in taxes  Anyway  There's a lot of people  In a forty to fifty percent  Tax bracket  Yep  And I'm not saying  That wealthier people  Shouldn't pay more  Because it is fair  But it should be  Based on a percentage  Can I say something?  Go ahead  I make forty eight thousand dollars  A year  I pay four percent  Out of all my  Every paycheck I get  Goes to FICA  Right?  Yep  And I pay  Up to forty eight thousand dollars  That's how much I make a year  Right  You take somebody  Who makes two hundred 
[02:20:30]  Million dollars a year  After they make  Ninety thousand dollars  In the second week  Of January  Or the first week  Of January  They don't pay  Another fucking penny  For the rest of the year  Into social security  Dude dude  I know what you're saying  And I don't totally  Disagree with you  But my problem  When you're going  By a percentage basis  Is if the tax system  Was like  Looked at that way  Like again  Seventeen percent  For everyone  I would think  You had a more  Valid argument  But now the  Democrat  Now they're saying  A percentage  Four percent  For everybody  And yet when it  Comes to  Alright let's have  A seventeen percent  They're much more 
[02:21:00]  Comfortable taxing  Someone higher  With the more money  They make  We're just talking  About social security  Not taxes in general  No I'm not talking  About a tax principle  I'm arguing  The social security  Right right  I hear you  But Scott  You've got to  Understand something  As far as the  Democrats are concerned  This is just  Another piece  Like everything  The Democrats  Come up with  And say  Well the wealthier  Americans have to  Pay this  This  This  You put them  All together  Scott  And it's not just  Paying a little more  Than the ninety thousand  A year  Or paying this  Or a percentage 
[02:21:30]  Of the tax  You add all these  Things up  And the public  Is getting the  Shit taxed out of them  And it's the public  That is  Actually  Attained some type  Of American dream  They're the ones  That now have to  Get the burden  And all the entitlements  Paid in this country  Is from the middle class  And they're screwing us  On a daily basis  I mean  His latest tax cut  For the top two percent  Of the country  While we're at war  Trying to pay for the armor  Trying to pay for  You know  Everything that goes  Along with the war  He gives the top  Two percent of this country 
[02:22:00]  A fucking tax break  Scott  Here's my  Bullshit  The public  And they're democrat  You cannot agree with that  The top two percent  Of the country  Is paying  Ninety-eight percent  Of the freaking taxes  We're paying  Dude  Not where  They pay  Do you know  A lot of people  Are in a forty  To five  A forty-five percent  Tax bracket  I mean  Dude that is sickening  To have to pay  Forty-five percent  Or whatever  Or forty percent  Of your money  To the federal government  Off the top  Is revolting  I understand  If you're making  Forty-eight thousand dollars  A year  If you're making  Forty-eight grand a year  You're going to have  No sympathy  For a guy  That's screaming  That my god 
[02:22:30]  Why  If I make a million dollars  How come I'm being so taxed  I'm  There's no sympathy  That's going to go out  From people making  Forty thousand dollars a year  I understand that  But  It's just the way it is  You can't keep  Taxing these people  And by these people  I mean me  But they can keep  Taxing the middle class  The guys who make  Between twenty and sixty thousand dollars  A year  We're paying the brunt of it  But do they're taxing  No you're not  Eating the most of it  Yes we are  Look at  There's other news channels  Out there other than Fox  XM signed 
[02:23:00]  I'll send you my quarterly  I'll send you my quarterly  Tax bill my friend  Scott  Let me send you  Let me send you  My quarterly tax bill  And you tell me  Where the burden is  I'll send you what I pay  Every three fucking months  I'd love to see that  It's ridiculous  You come up the hard way  You used to be  A working class guy  And now you've got  You know a couple bucks  To rub together  You don't want to let go of it  Man  That's not true  No no no  I was fine with what  They were taking out  When I was making  Four hundred bucks a week  I was fine with it 
[02:23:30]  Are you making more now  Or are you making more  Than you did in 1984  I am making more now  Than I made in 1984  Percentage wise  And by that I mean  Everybody that worked  In 1984  You're teasing of course  Shut up  $10,000 and you've got to  Pay $300,000 worth of taxes  You owe $300,000  That sounds like a lot  If you make $40,000 a year  And you've got to pay $6,000  That doesn't sound like that much  Because you make less  Wait Scott  If you make  Scott if you make  How much you have to pay  $300,000 
[02:24:00]  I'm just throwing numbers  I don't know  I'm asking  I didn't hear the first figure  You said  I said  If you make  $10,000,000  If you make  $10,000,000  If you make  $10,000,000  The government  Is going to want  Almost five of it  Right  They're not taking  $400,000  If you make  $10,000,000  My friend  They're taking  $5,000,000  From you  And believe me  You might sit back  And go  Well you've got  $5,000,000 left  But when you had  $10,000  It'll piss you off  And I don't make  Exactly  You just made my point  Now how did I make 
[02:24:30]  Your point  Because $5,000,000  Exactly  That was my point  Scott  Are you a socialist  I mean do you think  That we should all  Just pay  I mean maybe  You're a socialist  I don't know  Well you know  Honestly  I don't really know  What I am  I used to  I voted for Reagan  When I was younger  I really didn't know  Then I got older  I got a union job  At one point in my life  And I kind of started  Paying attention  To what was going on  In politics  And where money was going 
[02:25:00]  I started getting involved  And educating myself  And reading  And I don't know  I think I might have  Some socialist in me  Because if being a socialist  Means that I'm for  The working class people  The guys who have to  Take a shower  When they get off work  The guys who work  50, 60 hours a week  Trying to take care  Of their family  And those guys  Are paying the brunt  Of everything  It's not the brunt  Of everything  Yes they are  Because at the end of the day  I ain't got no fucking money  And if you make  $10,000,000  You still got five  What the fuck man  I ain't got  That's the democratic way 
[02:25:30]  To look at things  It's more socialist  But the democrats' answer  To everything  Is to tax the people  That have made something  Of themselves in this country  And it's ridiculous  Bush came up with an idea  He's got this idea  About social security  And of course  The democrats  Just have to bash it  And I don't even think  Scott  I do think the middle class  Gets fucked horribly  And I do think  Look republicans  Are more for wealthier people  Democrats are more for  I mean that's  Since time out of mind 
[02:26:00]  It's been that way  And I don't disagree  That things have to be different  But I just don't like  The answer  Because you have to realize  That when you make  $50,000,000  That's one thing  I've never made anything  Close to a million dollars  In my life  I've never made that  Nothing even close  To that  I make decent money  But you know what  The government takes  A lot of it  A higher percentage  Than they should  I'm all for  Everybody paying 17%  I mean maybe  That answer's a flat rent  You know a flat tax  You know  But whatever  It just needs to work out 
[02:26:30]  And what I'm saying  With you is  In the long run  At the end of the day  It needs to work out  Financially  So you know  The middle class  Okay  Okay  The middle class  Does get fucked up  I mean you're not wrong  My grew up middle class  My father was out of work  And it stinks  We were broke a lot  It's awful  Yeah  So I don't think  You're wrong  I think everybody  Gets screwed  In their own  Relative way  You know  Yeah  Okay  There we go  Right Peewee  Okay  I got one more thing  Alright sweetie  No you don't 
[02:27:00]  Yeah I do  By God  Oh  Yeah  Hey I know  Sometimes  I got a feeling  You're the only one  That may lean  A little bit Democrat  All I'm saying  Is you're the voice  For you know  50%  I'll say  Well I ain't gonna say  How many listeners  Is Democratic  But I know  We all cringe  When fucking politics  Gets brought up  Democrats get bashed  And all I'm saying  Is flip on here  Every once in a while  And bring up  An argument to them guys  Scott  You're definitely  Very observant  But through this whole argument  I was eating my 
[02:27:30]  Egg white sandwich  Yeah  Hey if you guys  Fucking rock  And I'll never quit listening  I might fucking turn it down  When you start talking politics  We're not as  Scott we're not as conservative  As you think man  It's really not  I know  I'm not as conservative  As you think I am  I hate to you know  Play my cards  I can't be bothered  Because nothing ever changes  I know that's such a  Blanket statement  But  Nothing changes  These two  It's two just  Powerful teams  Just fighting it  Back and forth  And there's nothing  That really changes 
[02:28:00]  I mean obviously  They have to work together  But they're never  Going to work together  No if one side  Has a good idea  The other side  Won't support it  That's what I mean  Because it's partisan politics  I can't be bothered anymore  I swear to God  With politics  I can't be bothered anymore  On my time off  I started to  Actually start reading  A lot of  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Yeah  Jesus  Okay  I actually started reading  A lot of liberal books  I started reading  All the Michael Moore stuff  And I was paying attention  To Bill Maher  And things like that  And then I was just 
[02:28:30]  Then I was fed up  With what they had to say  As well  And I can't be  I swear to God  I can't be bothered  They're all phonies  One of the biggest books  That I've ever read  That changed my life  And I know you guys  Are going to fucking  Laugh at me  But uh  It honestly changed  My life  Is uh  Rent Boy  Al Franken  Al Franken  Uh  Lies and the line  Liars who tell him  It's a fucking great book  Republican or Democrat  It needs to read it  Why was that book great  I read that one too  I forgot to add that  To my little reading list  I did read that  Not only did he expose 
[02:29:00]  A lot of the lies  He gave you the reference  At the bottom of every page  Where you could go back  And look at it  Let me  Here's my question  Scott  I haven't read the book  But when you look at a guy  Like Michael Moore  You watch something  Like Roger and me  And you're like  Oh my god  But then when you read it  Debunked  And I'm not saying  That he's wrong  About everything  But when you see  All the bullshit  That gets thrown  Into any point of view  That's that agenda driven  You see like  Oh that made sense  When I read it  Or when I saw it  But now that I hear  The answers  And the rebuttals for that  It didn't make as much sense  As I thought  But both sides do that 
[02:29:30]  I know  I agree  I know  Okay have you  I guess you're talking  About like 9-11  Have you seen that  Fahrenheit 9-11  I have  No I was actually  Thinking about Roger and me  I have not seen  Fahrenheit 9-11  Okay well like  Fahrenheit 9-11  And everybody says  You know that book  Was full of lies  And I'm sorry  The movie was full of lies  And all kinds of shit  But there's a 9-11 reader  That came out  About six months ago  That goes along  With the book  That goes almost  Fucking frame by frame  And factuates  Everything through that movie  And why did he remove it  By what 
[02:30:00]  And when I hear  It was on television  And stuff  They'd ask him  You know they'd say  It was a lie  He would up front  And say well which part  Tell me what's a lie  And everybody  No offense but Jim  But everybody's like  Well I've never seen it  So  No no no  I didn't say  Fahrenheit 9-11  I don't know  My question about  Fahrenheit 9-11  Why did he remove it  From documentary  Oscar consideration  By playing it  What he pulled  Because his facts  Were being called  Into question  Because of his editing  He purposefully showed it  The night before the election  He said because he thought  It was important  But he knew that  That would  But he knew that  That would automatically 
[02:30:30]  Remove it  From documentary consideration  And that was a less  Humiliating way  Of having  His facts wouldn't be  Called into question  He wanted it named  For best picture  Which I didn't even  Get the nod for  So best documentary  Is what he wanted  When his facts  Were being called  Into question  It was embarrassing  So he shows it  The night before  The election  As a face saving  Way of removing  It from consideration  No  They showed it  Because like you said  The best documentary  He didn't show it  On TV  Because his facts  Were in question  Pay per view  Dude  Pay per view 
[02:31:00]  He showed it  On pay per view  Right  But it wasn't  Because his facts  Was in question  No I think it was  A way of getting  Of gracefully  Not being  Because he knew  That would remove him  From possible  Nomination for a documentary  Alright  I think he put it  On pay per view  Because he knows  I know this sounds  Like a fucking  Big time liberal  But he knows  That the Bush's  Administration  Has done nothing  But lied to us  For the last five years  And he wants to  Well  Just get the book  Well  Alright  Okay  Thank you  Alright Scott 
[02:31:30]  Thank you  I appreciate it guys  Bye Scott  You can argue  With them fuckers  Alright  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you Scott  Let me summarize  For everybody  Half the people  Out there  Agreed with  Anthony and Jim Norton  And half of the people  Agreed with Scott  The caller  Thank you  We changed  No one's mind  No  But go to  Moralize.com man  Roger and me  It was a brilliant documentary  Now look it up  And see a lot of the stuff  That looked great  When you watched it  And you're like  Oh that was wrong  I really thought  That Michael Moore 
[02:32:00]  Was fighting the good fight  I really did  For a while there  Especially when we're  On hiatus and stuff  But Anthony and I  Met that guy  He wants to be a rock star  Just like anyone else  In the entertainment business  Yeah  He's not actually  Fighting any fight  He found a little angle  He likes publicity  He likes money  He found a little angle  Where he gets  You know the publicity  And that's what he's really into  When those cameras turned on  When we were at that Beatles thing  He just played up to the cameras  And all that stuff  Just like  There's nothing wrong with that  But just like everybody else  You know  This guy isn't anything special 
[02:32:30]  He's no special  Than any of the other idiots  Out there  And when Scott just said  About like  When they asked Michael Moore  What lies  He said  And they could  Like when they told  Michael Moore  So what lies  And they couldn't say  Michael Moore and Bill O'Reilly  Had an impromptu debate  I read the entire transcript  Of the drug report  It was outside the Democratic Convention  It was in a parking lot  There was people around  It was a friendly debate  And I don't like O'Reilly  But he's a bright guy  And in this debate  They were talking about Bush being a liar  And O'Reilly cornered him verbally  And fucking wiped the floor with him 
[02:33:00]  Because one on one like that  Just two guys debating  One conservative  And him and ultra liberal  He got his face smashed in the debate  Did O'Reilly have a dildo in his ass  I think he did  He said something about  Washing that awful fat beard  With a loofah sponge  With a loofah  Which turned me on  Alright  Alright back to retard audio  Yes back to Rosie  Well we still have the Randy Rhoads thing  That's where it started  That is what started that  I like it  I love this ADD show  Alright so she's in  Where were we  She's in trouble for  Yeah with the Secret Service  They're kind of investigating 
[02:33:30]  If this is to be considered  A threat against the president's life  Right well we got the bit  We have the audio  Let's hear  Just a quick minute  Let's take a listen  See if there's a big deal here  This is the Randy Rhoads show  Air America Radio  We saw America  Through the Great Depression  And hot and cold wars  Our muscles boosted this nation's  Economic superiority  To dizzying heights  And then our time came  To enjoy just a little  Of the comfort and security 
[02:34:00]  We brought to the U.S. of A  So we joined with others  Of our era  To protect what's rightfully ours  But now we've learned  That the AARP  Isn't enough  Our pensions have been stolen  Our health benefits cut  And those of us with homes  Too often have to choose  Between heat and food  Okay  A spoiled child is telling us  Our social security  Isn't safe anymore  So he's gonna fix it for us  Well here's your answer 
[02:34:30]  You ungrateful whelp  The A-A-A-R-P  The American Association  Of Armed Retired People  Just try it  You little bastard  Oh let's not do that  I'm here in Florida  Let's not arm the old people  Until they leave  What is with all the killing 
[02:35:00]  Alright here's the deal  Wait wait what  Let me start Anthony  Please  Please  Give me my time  No hope  She should be sent to jail  Because that bitch just stinks  It's not funny  It's awful  She should be sent to  Radio jail  Microphone not plugged in  Anything  Radio jail guys  Make her do a radio show  Without electricity  That should be  What  That's the big deal 
[02:35:30]  That's corny  That's the big deal too  How did anyone even interpret that  As a threat against the president  Isn't the president killing the old people  No I think it was the old people  Shooting at somebody  Yeah  Oh alright  You could assume it's the president  Alright  Because he's the one that's in charge of  You know  Any of the benefits that are being cut  For the old people  The reason they would pick up arms  And start shooting  But there was  Can I take back my statement  That I thought she ran a good talk show  No you can't take that back  That was really hacky and stupid 
[02:36:00]  But I want to know  If Air America is going to run  A little comedy parody  How about if a woman  Being punched in the face  Or violence  Domestic violence  I wonder if that's going to be  Like a little comedy thing  Or if they would object to that  Wholeheartedly on principle  And don't act like you're trying  To make a political statement  With that cornball shit  You played off as a bit  It was awful  And I couldn't even  If I heard that  In passing  And I didn't fall asleep  During it  I would not even  Know who the old people  Were shooting at  Yeah  Like you little bastard

I don't know  It was the job application one  Ben Bailey  Ben Bailey Boulevard  Okay  And he's a sociopath too 
[02:41:30]  He's a drinker  And a rage filled  Fucking psycho  And this gave you a chuckle  On the way in?  Yes it did  So the rule is  Everybody  The rule is  If you screw up  Just one too many  Job interviews  You become  A stand up comedian  That's how it happened to me  You never make it through 
[02:42:00]  A job interview  You know  It's such a high pressure situation  You know  You really need that job  You get all dressed up  Go in there  A couple minutes early  You're trying real hard  Not to make any stupid mistakes  The first opportunity  To make a stupid mistake  You make  A stupid mistake  They give you that application  You accidentally  Put your name  In the wrong box 
[02:42:30]  You already  Didn't get the job  Right?  Because what are you going to do?  What are you going to scribble it out?  Hand in your application  With a giant scribble mark  Right on top  There you go  There you go  Say did I get the job? 
[02:43:00]  No  Can't ask for another application either  Can you?  Uh  Could I have another application?  Please?  Why?  Because I put my name in the wrong box  They're going to be like  You don't need another application sir  Because we're not hiring any idiots today 
[02:43:30]  You put your name in the wrong box  In a job application  You have no other option  But to leave your name  In the wrong box  And you're in the interview  And the guy's like  So your name is  Ben Bailey  Yes  And you currently reside  At 365 
[02:44:00]  Ben Bailey Park  Yes  Yes I do 
[02:44:30]  Why I've lived there all my life  But don't try to send me mail  I put my mailing address  In the comments box  And  And due to a bizarre zoning coincidence 
[02:45:00]  My zip code is exactly the same  As the first five digits of my phone number  Why I am clearly  The man for the sky  Hey  This is Ozzy Osbourne 
[02:45:30]  Ha ha ha ha ha  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony  Stay fucking tuned  As I'll come and fucking kill your favorite pet  Hey we gotta get this guy in right away 
[02:46:00]  He's been waiting way too long out there  And we don't like people waiting outside the studio  ever. Jim Norton. Ever. God, you're right, Jim. Jesus, what was I thinking? Jim Norton.  Let's see. Oh, Dalton. I know your name. What's up, Dalton Ross? How are you, sir?  Hey. Getting all situated, Anthony. Of course. From Entertainment Weekly. What's up? Hello,  sir. How are you? I'm hanging. Doing all right? What do you do with Entertainment Weekly? 
[02:46:30]  Really? I watch a hell of a lot of TV, and they pay me to do that, which works out pretty  well, but every once in a while, I actually have to write about it. Wow, I figured out  how to do that and not even have to write about it. Yeah, really? It's like pretty much my  job is to watch TV and then come in here and just spout about things. That must make watching  TV just like a job, though. Well, you know, it's interesting. You can't enjoy it anymore.  Well, actually, I never watch it at night. That's my down time. I actually watch it either  on DVDs or tapes before I enter. I fire up the TiVo, and I watch it. That way, you get 
[02:47:00]  to cut out the commercials, which is nice. TiVo must be like a boon to your industry.  Yeah. You just have to record it on video. I'd marry my TiVo if I could. My wife would  let it. I'd move to Utah and do that. I like talking to other people that have stupid jobs  like us. Yeah. Like, you spend your day watching TV, and that is your job. That just amazes  me. It's pretty sweet. No more videotapes, though, which was just like, ugh. Oh, yeah.  Yeah. Let me just get rid of the goddamn videotapes. Who doesn't have a DVD player? 
[02:47:30]  He's a rich guy. He's a lot of people out there. Scott from Arizona probably doesn't.  You might have been able to get me with that for maybe a few years back. Who, Anthony?  Everyone above 100th Street here in New York City. Who are you kidding?  He also doesn't have a butler and cook. He doesn't have a butler. He has a cook, though.  The opium Bruce Wayne show. I have a butler.  Sorry, Dalton Boat. That's all good. I hear there's a big buzz on this HBO show,  a Louis C.K. pilot. There's supposed to be a hot buzz in the entertainment industry about 
[02:48:00]  that. Well, you know, there's a hot buzz on anything on HBO. Pretty much anything that  can get on there. Lisa Kudrow's got a new show coming on. Lisa Kudrow on HBO?  Yeah. What's she going to be doing? She's going to be doing sort of a show as an actress looking  gig, you know, one of those sort of pseudo-real, pseudo-fake sort of shows, you know. Entourage  is coming back. Entourage is funny. I like Entourage.  The Louis C.K. thing was supposed to be huge.  Yep, yep. Deadwood is great.  Deadwood's good for...  Love Deadwood.  ...waiting for the Sopranos to show up.  Deadwood's great, but if you turn away, it's like The Wire. You turn away for one second, 
[02:48:30]  you have no idea what the hell's going on. You know what I mean? Seriously, don't answer  the phone. Don't go to the bathroom. Don't make any popcorn or else you're just completely lost.  Yeah, you'll get tripped up on the storyline. I like the use of the C word, very prominent.  I counted. I actually counted one episode 39 times in about a 50-minute episode.  Wow.  Yeah, they throw that word around a lot.  Yeah, it's crazy. And he claims it's historically accurate. I don't know about that.  It used to be used a lot back in the olden days.  That's what he says. So David Milch, creator David Milch says, I don't know about that. 
[02:49:00]  I guess so. It's a damn entertaining program.  The Louis C.K. project didn't really have a lot of that profiling. I mean, they had like a married couple  and some other stuff. By the way, he's involved with that project.  Yes, I've noticed.  Nah, he doesn't care less about it. I'm speaking very objectively.  So Mace Sweeps have begun. Well, it will begin this coming weekend, right?  They're beginning now. They're beginning now. A lot of finales. A lot of big events.  You know, we've got that Elvis thing.  What is that?  Well, you know, it seems like every ten years they've got a new Elvis thing, right?  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  It's like the king is still in the building, I guess. I don't know. I don't know if I'm going to watch it.  You've got two nights.  You have to watch it. That's your job.  Yeah, but we all... I know. It is my job.  Watch it. Watch it.  But I don't know if I would because, I mean, we all know how it's going to end, right?  The dude's going to get fat. He's going to start wearing white jumpsuits and doing karate on stage.  And then he takes the dump and dies.  Sounds like the Ben Sparks story.  Yeah, and a lot of people blame his dying on the pills and stuff.  I don't know. I sort of think if you've got a bowl of bacon on your piano for an everyday snack,  you're not going to sort of hit triple digits in the years department anyway. 
[02:50:00]  It's sort of, you know, you're in borrowed time to begin with.  Yeah, Dr. Nacopoulos, they all blame Dr. Mick. They said he gave him the pills, he killed them.  But the guy wanted to stop giving him pills, and Elvis said, stop giving me pills, I'll buy the goddamn drugstore.  Yeah.  What are you doing, not giving Elvis pills?  No, you've got to give Elvis the pills.  Even if he doesn't want them, you should give them them.  Yeah, Elvis is going to get the damn pills.  Of course.  He's going to get the damn pills.  Absolutely.  What are you talking about American Idol?  American Idol, you know, I'm just, I'm not into the singers this much this year.  You know, they're trying to do sort of the rock and roll thing with like, you know, some of these guys.  It's just not happening for me. 
[02:50:30]  That show is all about the auditions.  I watched the first, I don't know, two or three shows, and then I was done.  And I set it on this program, I was done.  This guy watches every episode.  But what you just said doesn't make sense.  It's just about the auditions.  That's all I watch.  I don't watch anything I watch.  You mean the bad guys.  Because you don't watch anything else.  There's all these dopes that think they have talent and making complete fools of themselves  on national TV.  I enjoyed that.  But then it takes another whole turn.  It's like two shows in one.  You get through that and then you get to the point where you start seeing these people 
[02:51:00]  on a weekly basis.  You know, you find ones that are good, some that are bad.  Ones you want kicked off and they keep going week after week.  Are you rooting for one in particular every week?  Let me think.  Oh God, don't say that.  No.  Thank you.  I'm not rooting for one.  For a couple to be thrown off that Anthony Fedorov has got to go.  Oh, he's horrible.  He stinks on ice.  Horrible.  And then the fat guy.  What's his name?  Scott Sable.  Scott.  He's got to go too.  Both of them.  They're usually in the bottom of the voting each week. 
[02:51:30]  And then what a shocker this week.  Hold on, hold on.  Yes.  We do have a TV guy here and we have to take this moment because Ellen DeGeneres is about  to dance again.  Here she goes.  She's terrific.  Here she goes.  Well, you never know when she's going to start.  That's the beauty of this bit.  Like she teased that she might have, she was about to start dancing and then she stopped.  Well, she's clapping for herself too.  She's pumping herself up.  You know, this is sort of a pre-game routine.  It would disappoint the audience because they want to dance with her.  Wow.  Look at this.  And on the other screen in the other corner we have Tony Danza. 
[02:52:00]  It's like Battle of the Retards.  In this corner.  What do you think of these shows there?  I think Danza and I are sort of wearing the same suit there.  That's a little frightening.  It's like, what's that all about?  I'm not a big daytime talker guy.  You know, I watch all my stuff like I've got to watch the nighttime stuff during the  day.  You watch that during the day so you don't really catch this drivel.  Anyway, back to American Idol.  I'm sorry.  Do you want a TV show or do you just write for them?  I write about TV shows.  It's a magazine, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Entertainment Weekly.  I know. 
[02:52:30]  No, you didn't.  He's got his own stuff going on.  He's got his own thing happening over there.  I love it.  Jimmy is so self-centered.  I'm just a bad pop culture guy.  I know I should know this stuff, but I don't.  Let me tell you about Idol.  The reason to watch Idol now is just to watch how insane Paula Abdul is every week.  She's crazy and I'm glad people are starting to address this.  From the start of the show, I was like, this woman's on drugs.  There's something wrong with her.  According to this primetime special, that might not be the only thing she was on.  I don't know.  We'll see.  Maybe some sex going on between her and one of the contestants. 
[02:53:00]  I don't know.  That's the rumor.  Or the judges.  Maybe there's something going on.  Yeah, yeah.  They're going to do a whole expose.  When is that?  Next week?  Yeah.  Apparently, if it airs, she's threatening to sue and stuff.  We'll see what happens.  Oh, it'll air.  They'll send their lawyers out and make sure it airs because now it's gotten so much publicity.  It's going to do great.  It'll be interesting to see what happens with Idol, too, because the finale is the same  night as the Lost finale.  Both two-hour finales the same night.  But come on.  The Idol finale, they don't do anything for an hour and 55 minutes.  I know.  You can sit around there and watch Jackoff postpone the ending for 50 minutes. 
[02:53:30]  Secrets.  Right after the break.  What's the Lost finale?  25th.  The show Lost.  You ever see that?  I saw one episode of it.  Oh, is it a show called Lost?  I'm not kidding.  I thought there was a Lost finale from American Idol.  I swear to God.  The Lost finale?  The Lost episode.  That's a good one.  Found in Jackie Gleason's old locker.  No, I thought there was a mistake or something that got screwed up and they fixed it.  Right.  Yeah.  No, the people on the island, you know.  I watched one episode of that show and I was like, I could give a crap.  It's good.  It's good.  Really?  You like that one? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, I like it.  I'm into it.  I'm into it.  I mean, you know, you've got to stick with it.  There's a lot of stuff going on.  It's sort of hard to pop in and out.  Yeah, that's what it is.  You can't kind of step into that show.  The characters and stuff.  What about, we've seen a little preview of Rosie O'Donnell's movie this Sunday.  Oh, my God.  Where she plays the retard.  Jesus.  Have you heard the audio?  It's really good.  She's convincing.  Oh, yeah.  Did we have that clip again?  Where is it?  Because we made a little, we noticed something here.  If we could play the clip of Rosie.  What's up with her hair in that movie, too? 
[02:54:30]  Have you seen that?  She's got like a Harper Marks Arnold Horshack.  It is a Horshack.  It is a Horshack.  There's a thing going on there.  It is a Horshack.  You're right.  And then she's wearing Blossoms hat.  Just so she's more believable.  That's all.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  Here's the clip.  Here's the clip.  And what is this?  Britney Spears?  Ha ha!  No, not Britney Spears.  I'm Cole Vest.  And you're a dolphin.  You're new.  How do you know my name?  You're new.  Cause I know everything.  Ha ha!  Listen. 
[02:55:00]  I can't stop on Carlton Street.  Carlton's not a bus stop.  Oh, listen to Henry.  You have to stop there because Miss Pack has a swollen up leg and she has to go to the doctor  at 11.  So stop on Carlton Street, Rudolpho, and listen to me because I only tell you two times.  That's it.  Then you're on your own.  Morning, Mr. Breakfast.  Can I have that Mr. Cheese cereal?  Okay!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  I pity the poor fool who don't eat my cereal!  Ha ha!  Very similar, isn't it there, Dalton? 
[02:55:30]  Rosie's Playhouse?  She is completely doing pee-wee.  Everyone's saying how brilliant she is in this role.  What do you think, Dalton?  What go through your head when you hear something like that?  It used to be you played a mentally challenged, I'm going to use the PC term there, and you  were on the road to Oscar glory, but now it's just like, come on, Robin Williams is doing  it again on screen, it's just like, wow, that's a tall order right there.  When did Robin Williams do it?  He's doing that new David Duchovny movie.  Yeah, which is just getting panned.  Ellen! 
[02:56:00]  Ellen's dancing!  Damn, she's smooth.  Yay!  She is smooth.  And look at the audience is dancing with her.  They're so happy to be there.  She is putting the honky and funky right now, ladies and gentlemen.  She is fantastic.  You know damn well she doesn't want to dance anymore.  Why is she taking people's coats?  I don't know.  She's safe.  She's incorrigible.  She's got their chairs.  Tough times financially for Ellen, you know?  She's giving them to someone else.  Ellen!  Oh, she's nutty.  This is crazy.  Oh my God, boy.  I can't even steal.  I can't.  Wow.  The public lapsed this crap up. 
[02:56:30]  Oh boy.  Just lapsed.  She's still going too.  I know, she'll go for five minutes.  Yeah, I know.  She's terrific.  I bet you if you talk to Ellen behind the scenes, she hates dancing.  It was one of those goofy things that worked, but now everyone's like, no, it's a hit.  You've got to do it every show now.  Yeah.  What a workout that woman's getting though.  Come on, let's be honest.  Oh.  Hollywood is so good with just knowing when to let something rest.  As good as we are on this show with our bits that go on forever and ever and ever.  And what is it about the one guy from American Idol, the guy that's not supposed to be on 
[02:57:00]  the show anymore?  The fat guy?  Yeah.  Which one?  The fat guy, Scott.  He was in The Post today.  Oh, you mean Scott or Bo Bice?  He's just awful.  Bo Bice got...  Yeah, he got rung up too.  He had a record.  He had a...  And not the kind he's looking for.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, he was busted for pot and coke.  Yeah.  But then he got off the hook because he went into some kind of drug treatment program and  they plea-barguined it down.  But it doesn't seem like American Idol really cares.  He's one of the standout stars of the show this season, so they're not going to dump him. 
[02:57:30]  That's right.  They love the Rockers this year, although the Rocker got voted off this week, so Paula didn't seem  too happy about that.  No, she was, again, just a complete emotional breakdown she had.  She looked like she was going to make out with his mom.  Did you see that?  She's huddling with his mom afterwards and sort of getting a little too close for comfort,  if you ask me, if I could throw a little Jim J. Bullock in there.  I don't know.  Oh, he was fantastic.  He was a genius.  He hasn't done anything since that show, which is a sin.  Hey, I believe you forgot Boogie's Diner. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, well, I don't think anyone saw it, yeah.  What's that?  Constantine was singing his song that got him kicked off the show, that Nickelback song,  which he did a horrible job on, and that's why he got the boot.  But, this Scott Savold guy, what's his name?  Savold, Savold, yeah, whatever.  Savoldi?  I don't know.  Whatever's clever.  He is awful.  He doesn't have the idle look.  His voice is awful.  He can't stay on key.  And week after week, they keep voting for this guy. 
[02:58:30]  And he beat up his kid's mom, right?  He did something like that.  Yeah.  That's just like the cherry on top.  Constantine's mom was crying and Paul Abdul went over and just started weeping into her  face, like holding her cheeks and saying it's okay.  All right, now I've got to watch it again.  They keep focusing on Paul Abdul being a lunatic.  I've got to watch that now.  That's the hook.  Apparently, Scott had a legal problem, too.  He beat up his baby mama.  Yeah.  He beat up his kid's mom or something.  He beat up his kid's mom.  I don't think they care anymore. 
[02:59:00]  They usually throw people off for this, but now it doesn't matter.  They're hoping to get people with records and then slowly but surely exploit this stuff  as the show goes on and get the press going.  He's a gangster.  Hey, so May Sweeps has begun technically.  Yeah.  Anyone doing anything really crazy?  Well, yeah, there are a few things going on.  I guess you've got, first of all, Britney Spears.  People can never get enough Britney Spears.  She actually has a show, a reality show, with her husband, Kevin Federline.  I love it.  I'm going to read you.  This is from UPN.  Direct from UPN. 
[02:59:30]  Describe the program.  It's going to be airing starting May 17th.  International icon Britney Spears and husband Kevin Federline share their personal love  story through exclusive, never-before-seen private home videos they shot themselves during  their courtship, engagement, and wedding.  It's like, where is the barf bag when you need it right there?  Who cares?  It's literally home movies.  It's like home movies.  Yeah, sitting down and watching Britney's home movies.  Yeah.  Good stuff, though.  Good stuff.  That guy, now that he's knocked her up, he's going to move on. 
[03:00:00]  He's going to move on to hot pieces of asses.  Because now he's very famous because he's the guy that knocked up Britney Spears.  Yeah.  Now he's on the cover by himself on all these magazines.  His star is rising.  You're right.  And, you know, he will move on to young snatch.  Well, he sort of did what Chris Judd did and he sort of kicked it up a notch.  You know, he married the hottie and he got her pregnant, you know?  You know what show is so underrated and it's one of the best shows on television right now? 
[03:00:30]  Life on a Stick.  Have you seen that?  So not with you on that.  So not with you.  I can't even fake it.  I actually watched Stacked.  Have you watched Stacked yet?  No.  That's the Pamela Anderson one.  And I said, this actually almost makes Life on a Stick look good.  Almost.  Really?  Not quite.  That's really bad too, yeah.  We got the Life on a Stick promo, Anthony.  Oh.  We were supposed to play these weeks ago.  Really?  Yeah.  I can't wait to hear this.  Because you notice how awful.  They've been promoing this show forever.  And the promos that they were playing on Fox during, you know, American Idol and other shows on Fox, 
[03:01:00]  it was like they were trying to get you to not watch this.  It was so completely devoid of anything interesting or funny that you would watch it.  It almost looked like an SNL sketch or a Mad TV sketch of a show that wasn't supposed to be funny.  Yeah.  That's pretty right on.  It was horrid.  Maybe it's a Geico commercial.  Then you don't know until they say, you know, why have you called Geico?  All right.  Let's play the promo here and take a listen to this. 
[03:01:30]  For some, the dream is to become an idol.  Be a dumbo child dumbo.  For others.  A medium-sized dumbo.  It's Wieners.  Look at all those customers.  We're going to imitate them.  Wieners, wieners, wieners.  Some dick and some of them.  If we sing that, the police will come.  Introducing Life on a Stick.  Once in a while, a hot dog comes along.  Premieres tomorrow after American Idol on Fox.  Okay! 
[03:02:00]  He's singing about hot dogs.  That's hilarious.  That is so bad.  And watching these, you're like, this has to be a joke.  And the show's worse.  Yeah.  What's the show about?  I think it's two guys that work in a hot dog type restaurant that looks like a McDonald's  for hot dogs.  I've never seen any type of restaurant like this.  And it's their hijinks with their stereotypical Indian, I guess he is, or Arab.  I can't even tell a boss that always goofs on them and they goom on him back and they're 
[03:02:30]  really stupid, sort of trying to be like a Beavis and Butthead type characters.  When did Hollywood become so irrelevant with any type of real character portrayal?  How did it stop being anything that was real or meaningful?  It's just shit.  All of it is crap.  These over-the-top bad characters.  None of it's funny.  No.  It's not ironic.  It's awful.  Now, we only heard one.  Maybe, do we have another one?  Yeah, let's try another.  Let's try another.  Maybe it was just that one. 
[03:03:00]  Give it a second chance.  Maybe I judged too quickly?  Yeah, Jimmy.  Laz and Fred dreamed of having it all.  They got wieners.  This job sucks.  Yeah.  Except for the hats.  They're outstandingly tall.  Introducing Life on a Stick.  Your stepbrother has condemned us all to hell.  We're not in hell.  Premieres tomorrow after American Idol on Fox.  They couldn't find one moment that might even give you a chuckle to put on their promos.  Not a one. 
[03:03:30]  The only people I want killed more than those actors and writers is the fucking studio audience members that are howling in the background.  Oh, howling.  That had to be sweetened.  There's no way.  Well, that's all machines.  That's all machines.  Nitrous into the audience.  Your brother doomed us to hell.  Hell's hot.  Yeah, they went back to the weird joke.  My father's funny!  Ha ha!  Fox tomorrow.  Everything they know about life.  What if we deep-fried everything in Mr. Hutts' office?  They're learning at the food court.  You will all go to prison for the rest of your lives!  Introducing Life on a Stick. 
[03:04:00]  What were you thinking?  Just now?  See, this is why I would rather not parent.  It's just frustrating.  Premieres tomorrow after American Idol on Fox.  Look at Jimmy.  Jimmy is ready to jump through the window.  It's the cadence.  It's, you know, music, music, music.  Bah!  Silence, and then the line is delivered.  It's the same thing on every promos.  And they suck.  They suck.  You're scaring Dalton.  No, it's funny you mention that.  But it's funny because that's the way all the promos are constructed.  And even if you put a funny joke in there, by the way it's constructed, it's just not even funny.  Right.  If you take, like, a one-liner out of a show with no context and just put it after some bad music, yeah, it's just like, what do you got? 
[03:04:30]  Nothing.  It's just crap.  Yeah.  They deserve it.  Life on a stick.  Yeah.  Premiering on Vag.  Shut the fuck up.  Oh.  Yeah, more on May Sweeps there.  Yeah, well, hey.  Tim, another show going by.  Bye-bye.  Star Trek's getting canceled.  Yes, the latest installment.  Enterprise.  Enterprise, May 13th will be the finale.  It's actually funny.  Our, you know, our West Coast office is right across the street from UPN.  And one of our writers was driving in and he saw two people out front picketing UPN. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, God.  So I'm thinking if you're UPN and you see only two people out front, like, bemoaning the  cancellation of one of your shows, you probably made the right call.  You can't pull the plug quickly enough.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, there was, well, any time any of the Star Trek shows go off, you get the geek letter  writing and geek protesting, but there's really not that many, like you said, two guys out  there.  And this show, you know, I'm a pretty big Star Trek fan, but just never really got me.  Yeah, it started off with a little promise, but it just sort of, it just never hooked on. 
[03:05:30]  Sort of a next generation guy.  I sort of like that one.  Yeah.  But, you know, this just did nothing for me.  I like the next generation.  Original series, of course.  Yeah.  Classic.  And then the movies, all of them.  I like that.  Except the first one.  Another show going by.  Rathacon, baby.  Rathacon.  Rathacon's like the best.  Yeah.  The first one, it's like, hey, could you fire a fucking phaser?  Yeah.  Could you do something?  It's the most boring trying to be like 2001 A Space Odyssey, but it's Star Trek.  You want to see, you know, some combat and stuff. 
[03:06:00]  So then when Rath came out, it was like, yeah, it was great.  Yeah, it was great.  It was great.  Yeah, it was fantastic.  Another show going by by Everybody Loves Raymond.  Yeah, May 16th.  May 16th, the good news is that they're not going to try and do some Seinfeld, you know,  wrap everything up, you know, some grand...  It's just going to be pretty much...  They didn't really wrap up Seinfeld.  They're still sitting in that jail somewhere.  They are in that jail.  So doing a hard time.  With the fat guy.  But they're going to...  It's basically going to be like a regular episode.  They're going to do like an hour-long clip show beforehand.  Then they'll do sort of a regular half-hour goodbye.  And, you know, we'll hope for the best. 
[03:06:30]  You know, the show slid for me.  I used to think it was very, very funny.  The past year or two just hasn't really hit it as much for me.  Probably best to go out now.  First season, I watched it and thought it was really good.  As a matter of fact, I actually was having to defend it with Opie.  I remember him saying, oh, all these sitcoms that are coming out.  I go, no, that one's pretty good.  And then it just really started stinking.  Yeah, it's sort of...  You know, it's hard when you're on that long.  As you know, you just say fresh and new and it just, you know...  Oh, tell us about it.  I can't be bothered with the sitcoms like everybody does, Raymond. 
[03:07:00]  I mean, I love Curb Your Enthusiasm.  That's my show, man.  Yeah.  That's the type of thing I want to see more of.  Buy the DVD box that's like Taxi, all that stuff.  Watch it.  And just let the networks just go into the toilet with their shit and awful shows.  Buy the old show.  All in the family.  They're just degraded.  Buy the old shows.  Watch them, yeah.  Bob Newhart just came out on DVD.  Hilarious.  With Suzanne Plachette.  Oh, yeah.  Great.  Yeah.  Survivor.  Survivor.  I used to be a huge Survivor fan.  I saw the first maybe three or four and then I just kind of faded away as a viewer. 
[03:07:30]  I think it comes and goes.  It's really like a...  It has good seasons and bad seasons.  It sort of depends on the cast.  I think this season's actually been pretty good.  Last season was a stinker.  This one I think has been pretty good.  You know, they had that one tribe just got decimated all the way down.  And so I think it's been a pretty good season.  What is interesting though is, you know, they got Boston Rob and Amber from the All-Stars.  They're on The Amazing Race.  That finale is May 10th.  And then they're going to air their wedding on May 24th.  I just don't see how that's interesting unless Boston Rob is like, you know, somehow, you know, 
[03:08:00]  swindling the florist.  But I don't know really where the intrigue is going to come from that.  Yeah, I have no idea.  For chicks.  Maybe she doesn't show up to the wedding.  Oh, there you go.  And then there's a police investigation.  Maybe she went out jogging.  Maybe she goes out jogging, turns up missing.  Went jogging down the beach.  The police declared a criminal case.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, their whole appeal is just how, you know, down and dirty they can get in a gaming strategic element.  I don't know what's going to happen with that wedding, you know.  Well, Survivor's still, you know, getting the ratings though. 
[03:08:30]  20 million people.  I mean, 20 million people.  It's pretty crazy.  I know nobody that watches it.  Like, I don't even, it doesn't have that water cooler talk that it did the first couple of seasons.  That's for sure.  You know, nothing really has water cooler talk now.  It seems in a sense because the way that it is, you know, you TiVo it, not everyone's watching it when it's on.  At the same time.  Yeah.  That's a good point.  People bring bottled water to work.  That's right.  That's part of the problem.  That's the last show.  It was a tough crowd.  Tough crowd.  Colin Quinn's a tough crowd.  There he goes again.  You make a good show. 
[03:09:00]  He makes a really good point though.  When Seinfeld was on Thursday nights, Friday, everybody was talking about it around work.  ER was another show people talked about a lot.  NYPD Blue.  A million of those shows, but with the TiVo and everything else, they're so late.  They're watching it at all different times, and we're not syncing up as a society as far as our TV viewing anymore.  People in our office are literally walking around in the mornings with their hands over their ears because they don't want to hear people talking about it.  I mean, you almost don't want to talk about it and ruin it for someone.  That's the best way to talk about it.  Spoiler.  Go ahead. 
[03:09:30]  Wreck it for everybody.  Family Guy.  Family Guy and American Dad.  And American Dad.  Seth MacFarlane's new.  He was on here, right?  Did you guys have him on?  Yeah, we had Seth on and Alex, who does Lois.  And I couldn't be happier that they're bringing that show back.  I just hope they don't lose their edge because the climate's different now, you know?  Here's what's interesting about it.  Okay, we know the show was on, right?  It got canceled.  It comes out on DVD.  Huge smash.  But a huge smash for DVD is about two million.  I think it's still about two million.  The question is, is it going to be able to do network numbers to stay on a network? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  That's really...  Because if two million people are passionate about it, they watch.  That's all it watches.  We all know that's a flop for networks.  So are other people now going to come to the party?  I don't know.  Yeah, we'll have to wait and see on that.  What do you think?  Arrested Development coming back or no?  I really hope so.  I just think it's hilarious.  I think it's great.  It's a funny show.  It's funny.  It's inventive.  It's different.  It's what TV needs.  You know all these fans trying to save shows who told about the two people on Star Trek.  But Fox has actually organized their own Save Arrested Development campaign, which 
[03:10:30]  is really sort of odd.  Yeah, aren't they the ones that really make the final decision?  They make the decision.  But they've started a website and they're like sending out t-shirts and doing all this  stuff.  You know, it gives prestige to Fox Network.  I know that's almost an oxymoron to put prestige and Fox Network in the same sentence.  But it really doesn't do big numbers.  They put it after The Simpsons.  It's still not doing it, but it's hilarious.  It's just great.  It is.  And it just goes to show you the kind of crap that the public in general licks up.  Oh, yeah.  Just garbage gets numbers. 
[03:11:00]  And then anything new, inventive, a little different, something that might take a little  more thought or some getting used to than just plopping down in front of the same  basic formula-driven sitcom crap, it doesn't do well because people are just stupid.  Yeah, they just want to tune out.  They don't want to think.  What do you think?  I mean, my friend and I were talking and TV in general is just so watered down.  I mean, is it because of the mentality?  Well, I think it's also that there's so much more out there and the whole market's 
[03:11:30]  so saturated.  So there are still good programs on television.  Probably if you count up the number of good shows on television now, if you include cable,  there used to be, you get the same number even more, but it's just the crapola meter's  out of control on the other side.  So there is some good stuff there, but you have to weed through so much bad stuff just  to get to it.  Yeah, but we were watching.  I never saw Arrested Development.  Was it second or third season?  Second season.  And he's like, dude, this show is just like...  I'm like, well, you know.  It's great.  You've got to check it out. 
[03:12:00]  I mean, that's why the DVDs are great.  You can go back, get the DVDs, see the whole first season.  And it's, you know, David Cross is in it and he's hysterical.  And it's something you wouldn't expect to see on Fox, which is probably the best endorsement  for it.  Very good.  All right.  Anything else in May Sweeps we haven't covered?  I know Oprah's doing some kind of wacky shows.  She's getting like twins together.  One's really, really fat and the other one's very thin and petite.  Wow.  And for some reason that's a big deal.  And then she's doing another one on twins where one of them had a sex change. 
[03:12:30]  This is a...  She's going that route?  She's going the Maury route with the freaks.  Yeah, I guess.  Freak show kind of thing?  Yeah.  I saw some commercials on that and I'm thinking that's not what Oprah does.  Got to give Maury his props, man.  That guy's been around for, you know, a lot of talk shows come and go.  Maury Povich knows what works.  Bring on the freaks and the DNA tests.  Yeah.  That's unbelievable.  The only shows he does is bring on, you know, baby mama and bring on the daddy.  Do a little DNA testing, see if it's the father. 
[03:13:00]  And then on the other hand, he brings in little progeria kids and fat infants and other freaks.  He's like P.T. Barnum.  You got to love him.  I wonder what his dad, Shirley Povich, who is just an incredibly well-respected journalist,  is thinking in his grave when he sees Maury doing some of that stuff.  I don't know.  I don't think he's really thinking.  Yeah, I don't think he's thinking too much.  I'm thinking, look at all the house Maury lives in, what a dope I was.  Sticking it out at the Washington Post for all those years, yeah. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, no, that's, you know, there's some other specials.  The Muppets are back.  I don't know.  I got a soft spot in my heart for the Muppets.  I don't know.  I like Animal.  Yeah.  They took a picture with De Niro and he turned me down.  He takes a picture with the...  Yeah, he took a picture with Muppets.  Fucking cloth puppets.  Ugh, that really hurt.  You should have put a little mop on your head.  Yeah.  I'm sure he would have loved that.  Bob.  Poke him with a big fuzzy finger. 
[03:14:00]  Alright, we want to thank Dalton Ross for stopping in.  Thanks, guys.  Oh, we're going to let him go.  I know.  We would let you go.  Well, we have to do the news and a couple other things.  We'd love to have you part of the program for a ton of time.  Come in and do some TV stuff with us.  Absolutely, guys.  It's been a pleasure.  Sure.  Alright.  My pleasure.  What are we plugging here?  Entertainment Weekly?  Entertainment Weekly, it's a good plug.  I do a...  Yeah, that's good enough.  Yeah, that's it.  It's not worth plugging other stuff, you know.  Show up here and there.  Entertainment Weekly, that's the weekly gig.  That's what pays the bills.  You do articles on people and stuff? 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Better watch out.  Alright, it's Dalton Ross, everyone.  When we get back, we've got Dee Dee doing the news from Washington.  Oh.  So, we'll do that in just a few minutes.  Let's do it!  The O.P. and Emity Show.  The O.P. and Emity Show.  The O.P. and Emity Show.  Alright.  I want a Frappuccino.  Shut up!  Hold on, three, four, five.  All right. 
[03:15:00]  I want a Frappuccino.  Shut up.  Hold on.  Three, four, five.  Get me a goddamn chocolate chip, medium Frappuccino, and a straw.  You ought to put the pedometer on Travis.  That's right.  They log up a few hundred miles.  Look at him run.  Hey, Ben, what is the pedometer saying?  I don't have one.  Four.  Oh, okay.  Four steps.  It's in the office.  He's up to four. 
[03:15:30]  He usually does ten steps.  It's in the office.  Ow!  Don't, don't.  What happened?  His back hurts.  He had a little picture.  My lower back is killing me.  What happened there?  Picked up some nephews and nieces yesterday.  Ah.  Running around with them.  Oh, no.  What, did you hurt your back close in the trunk?  Oh, Jesus.  Master Poe has given me all sorts of advice.  Oh, kick your legs up.  That will release the pressure on your lower back.  MP.  Interesting little story here. 
[03:16:00]  I know.  Rocker Tommy Lee.  Yeah.  Of course, we know he has a thing for big blondes.  So no one was surprised when he met a six-foot Pamazon.  That's like Amazon with a P.  at Seattle's Club Medusa  and started in with the hot and heavy tonsil hockey.  He's making out with a chick, a big blonde.  Looked like Pam, I guess, at this club.  But later in the evening, a snitch for the Enquirer  saw Tommy's turn-on, lifting, and in quotes,  it says, per, skirt, to hit the head at the men's room urinal. 
[03:16:30]  Tommy's seen none the wiser when he was seen  leaving hand-in-hand with his Pamela look-alike.  Well, we're guessing he may have gotten  a surprise package later.  A little thing for tranny?  How did you see that jerk?  Bet the tranny got a surprise package, too.  It's called jaundice.  What do you think Tommy was more shocked at?  The surprise in our pants or the surprise in his pool? 
[03:17:00]  He was surprised to see that little youngster  making out with the drain.  Holy crap.  Wow.  Happy bird.  Oops.  Blow out the candles.  Oh, no need to.  They're wet.  Everyone's crying.  DeeDee, save me.  Save me, DeeDee.  I always forget the pool thing, 
[03:17:30]  and you always remind me.  I love the pool thing.  Surprised.  All right.  DeeDee's going to save us.  Who is he, Luke Costello?  How?  A classic pool accident.  There's someone in the...  That's what happened.  Hold on, DeeDee.  Hello, 911 operator.  There's somebody in the...  A...  I bet. 
[03:18:00]  911, what's your emergency?  There's somebody in the...  Hey, we lost DeeDee.  What happened?  I don't know.  I said, hold on.  Where'd she go?  This was DeeDee's segment.  DeeDee.  DeeDee.  She didn't have something happen in a pool, did she?  No, in her, who knows?  Who knows?  Right.  She just gets spanked.  Who knows?  Dirty girl.  Dirty, dirty little cricket.  She's a dirty, dirty girl.  Oh, she's naughty.  She sure is.  Is she calling back? 
[03:18:30]  All right, here's DeeDee.  Where's DeeDee?  DeeDee.  DeeDee.  Oh, my God, you hung the phone up on me.  No, no, we didn't.  Okay.  We need you today.  Okay.  You want to do the news today?  Sure, I only have a few minutes, though,  because I have to go back in my studio soon.  Traffic?  Traffic, yep.  Chicago, Dallas.  I'm still doing Dallas for a few more weeks, and Minneapolis.  I've got to tell you, I hate the traffic channels at XM.  Why?  Why?  They're really boring.  Well, it's not...  Well, then, you know, you have over 100 channels to choose from, 
[03:19:00]  so listen to another one.  And I'm like, why am I listening to the traffic for Chicago?  I'm not in Chicago.  No, you've tuned to New York.  Oh.  You don't listen to Chicago traffic.  Don't you know how this works?  I was just, you know, taking a listen to all the other channels on XM.  I got it on my preset.  Who would spend their time in the car commuting, listening to the traffic for Atlanta?  Yeah.  There's a whole channel dedicated to traffic and weather in Atlanta.  Did you hear that new channel, Deep Traffic, where they actually just go over, like, if there's 
[03:19:30]  any back-to-bike pads and little alleys that people walk through?  Deep Traffic.  That is very good.  All right.  Tune into that.  Yes, DeeDee.  Okay.  I have a hot tween story for you.  Oh, hot tween.  Yes.  Love the tweens.  Tweens, yes.  Five Springfield, Ohio kids have been arrested, accused of taping themselves having sex. 
[03:20:00]  Wow.  Yep.  The sex tape was discovered just two days ago when detectives say one of the teens involved  showed it to her little brother.  He told his mother, and she went to the sheriff.  The four girls and one boy range in age from 12 to 17.  Who is the lucky boy?  I know.  Probably the 17-year-old.  Wow.  Like I said, who's the lucky boy?  How old were the girls?  Between 12 and 17.  Yeah.  Chinese disease.  Too young.  And then the tape is marked. 
[03:20:30]  The tape is marked porno.  Yeah?  The tape is marked porno on the side, says one lieutenant familiar with the case, and  it's a true description, he says.  I'm not going into details of what's on the tape.  It's appalling, says one detective.  I'm not going into details, because I don't want to waste any more time that could be spent  watching this movie again and again.  Very good, Anthony.  They're not going into details of what's on the tape, so use their imagination.  What tough detective is looking at that and being appalled?  I don't know.  I mean, stop. 
[03:21:00]  It's hot.  You're going to watch it and crank it.  Suck it, kid.  They're all kids.  Oh, God.  All kids just having fun like kids do.  That's right.  Did you ever make a sex tape?  What, an 8mm film?  They were consenting infants back in the older days.  Yeah.  Yeah, you have any sex tapes out there, DeeDee?  No, thank God.  I'm sure.  No, no, no, I don't.  Uh-oh.  You're sure what?  You destroyed the tape?  I know I don't.  Uh-oh.  You do, don't you? 
[03:21:30]  She taped him once.  Dirty, dirty girl.  We're not yelling green yet.  You tell us a little bit about this.  I know.  I don't have a tape out there, right?  You dirty, dirty girl, DeeDee.  I don't.  I don't have a tape.  You think you got rid of the tape.  There are no tapes of me.  No?  Are you being paddled by an African-American gentleman?  With his schlong.  With his UPS uniform on?  UPS.  Go on, UPS.  I got some news from Peru, too.  Peru.  All right.  Lima, Peru. 
[03:22:00]  The government politely are asking residents to refrain from making endangered frog smoothies.  Peruvian officials saved some 4,000 endangered frogs from being whizzed into popular drinks  after they were found hidden in a fridge.  We were checking the fridges when out jumped a frog.  It had escaped when they were in some big crates over there.  A spokeswoman for Lima City Hall said on Thursday,  the frogs are used for cocktails.  They put them in cocktails because they're supposed to have some kind of aphrodisiac quality. 
[03:22:30]  I told you the frogs were disappearing.  I said that two weeks ago on this flying program.  It's true.  So, um, don't, you know, don't drink frog smoothies.  Gives me the shits.  That's why they call it a toadstool.  Well, you know, your news stinks today.  No, it's good, DeeDee.  I liked it.  I liked the tween story.  It's not a frog thing. 
[03:23:00]  It's not time to do anything, though.  No time.  We've been asking you to do the news all week.  Yeah, but I've been very busy, and then I came on, and I said 10 a.m., and here it is at, what, 10.40 almost.  Told you.  It's busy here in traffic land.  All right.  All right.  Let's hear your next story.  Maybe it's a little better.  How about nurses unwittingly ate pot brownies when they were at work?  Ooh.  Yes.  Saucy.  Saucy.  Yeah, there you go.  You're getting this stuff in the Weekly World News.  We want hard-hitting news on this program.  No.  Well, I have a producer who did this for me, actually. 
[03:23:30]  Some kid did this for me.  Young Mike Nelson.  Young Mike Nelson, you stink.  That's very busy.  I need a producer.  All right.  Well, let's hear about the...  Nurses eating pot?  Sure.  Okay.  12 employees, including some nurses at California's Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center, ate a plate of brownies while on shift.  Authorities now suspect were laced with marijuana.  A hospital employee's family member allegedly brought the brownies to the hospital on April 20th.  So, a spokesperson said that patients weren't endangered because managers and other staff quickly filled in when the employees started feeling a little bit ill and high. 
[03:24:00]  So, you know, it is a little bit funny, but the spokesperson said, you know, it's not really...  Well, thank God no one was hurt.  Right.  That's all I can say about that.  I know.  Thank goodness.  Can you imagine that, though?  Yeah.  Put itching powder on someone's catheter.  Just laugh.  And that's some Hollywood news.  Oh, a little entertainment news.  Yeah, Katie Holmes, Tom Cruise, they know enough, they're an item. 
[03:24:30]  And Katie is saying that she's not a virgin.  She's saving herself for Mr. Right.  That she's not a virgin, but she's saving...  What is she saving, a balloon nut?  Yeah, what does that mean?  I mean, she is a virgin.  Oh.  I'm like half asleep.  I took some Ambien last night, so I'm a little groggy.  What do you think she's doing for Tom if she's not a virgin?  Well, that makes that rumor about Tom.  Maybe it's true.  Because, you know, him and Nicole, they adopted those kids.  Me and Deedee, we know what's going on out there.  I said the same thing, and these guys aren't agreeing with me.  I'm telling you.  Come on now.  Who? 
[03:25:00]  Now Nicole is saying she wants some of her own children coming out of her...  Come on now.  They adopted the kids.  It was all for show, I bet.  No, he just didn't want to wreck that nice body on Nicole Kidman.  I wouldn't...  If I was married to Nicole Kidman and she tried to have a kid, I would go bonkers.  Pardon my French.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Why would he be with a virgin?  And he's 42.  Come on now.  Yeah, that's a little weird.  I mean, yeah.  Hello.  He's onto something.  And it just sucks that everybody knows that she's a virgin and you're not getting laid. 
[03:25:30]  Maybe she's a technical virgin.  Technical virgin?  Maybe, Eric, she's a technical virgin.  You know, that could be.  Technical virgins are technically virgins, but, you know, they could definitely satisfy their men.  Yep.  Other areas, other things to do.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, geez.  Whoa, that was a big snort.  No, I was just thinking about something about other ways.  Never mind.  All right, hold on.  We've got a commercial for the technical virgin.  I've got big plans for my future. 
[03:26:00]  A good college, a career, maybe even my own business someday.  But one thing I'm not planning on is getting pregnant.  That's why I choose anal sex.  I mean, sure, it hurts a little, and I wind up walking funny for a day or two.  But I think my future's worth it.  But I think my future's worth it.  Anal sex.  The smart choice for your future.  What do you think, DeeDee?  Um...  I heard that.  Backdoor action.  Oh, it...  Never mind. 
[03:26:30]  Is that your thing, DeeDee?  I don't like it all the time.  I told you guys this before.  You're not into the, uh...  The back door looking like an ass cave?  Anal?  Not all the time.  It has to be with somebody I really like and feel safe with.  You don't like it with white gentlemen?  Where are you getting off at?  I was with...  I never did the jungle fever thing.  Good girl.  All right.  Yes.  Well, you were hinting to something just before we played that, that...  Yeah, all right.  So they're not having sex, but there's other ways.  What do you mean by that?  You were thinking...  No, no.  You were thinking of other ways. 
[03:27:00]  Well, you know...  Hello.  Well, job.  Yada, yada, yada.  Yada, yada, yada.  I'm looking at the time.  I have to do that.  Thank you, Elaine.  Jesus.  Sorry.  You ever just spit in your hand and help out a friend?  No.  I was in lube.  I was actually asking Ant.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  You got one more story for us?  No, I don't.  I actually have to do...  Ask Don.  He knows what it's like.  Wiki, ask him. 
[03:27:30]  I really have to do the...  Back to traffic.  Back to traffic.  The damn traffic.  You don't have, like...  Maybe...  You know what?  Maybe I can call up and you guys can listen to me do the traffic while I'm recording it.  Do you have to run down there to do it in time?  Yeah, I have to go run and do it right now.  Yeah.  And then...  Oh, my God.  Everyone knows the traffic is the same every freaking day.  Yeah, it's needy.  No, it's not.  Because sometimes there's disabled vehicles and accidents.  Just run the tape you ran last time.  Absolutely.  That's right. 
[03:28:00]  There's a five-mile delay.  Traffic is backed up because somebody dropped a serious satellite radio on the highway.  You know, one time I'm going to do the traffic for you guys.  The crews are attempting to move it.  We don't do traffic.  We've never done the dumb stuff on our show.  Well, we do dumb stuff, but not on purpose.  We don't do traffic and weather and that type of thing.  Okay.  Yeah.  I know.  All right, DeeDee.  I think we should do a weather forecast every day.  Let folks know what they're in for. 
[03:28:30]  You want me to get some weather together and do it for you next week?  No.  No.  No.  It's fine, DeeDee.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye, DeeDee.  Jesus, DeeDee.  Just go away.  We're going to look at you.  I mean, thank you so much.  Yeah.  We've got to get you out of here.  Have a good day.  Weekend.  Bye.  Bye.  What are you doing this weekend, DeeDee?  My parents left yesterday, so I'm having a manover this weekend.  Oh, my God.  How long were your parents in town?  Oh, God.  Two weeks.  Oh, so you are just all horned up and ready to go this weekend, huh?  Yes, I am.  Who's the lucky fella? 
[03:29:00]  No comment.  Who is the lucky fella?  A guy.  Yeah?  How horny are you right now, DeeDee?  Let's just say I'm chewing a lot of ice today.  Oh.  Oh, is that what you're doing?  You're horny?  She's trying to control herself.  Her parents were in town for two weeks, and they finally left, and she's getting some  action tonight.  Oh, we're good.  What kind of action do you think?  Are you going to have to be yelling the word green a lot tonight?  I'm not yelling green.  Oh, you're just going to let it keep going, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, I've got to go do traffic.  You got the lacrosse team coming over to you? 
[03:29:30]  No, I didn't find you if my mouth wasn't cold.  I didn't say lacrosse cream.  Oh, my God.  I'm not saying that's a zilch.  All right, DeeDee, could you give us a full report on your sex on Monday?  Um, um...  Will there be spanking involved?  Possibly.  Will you be doing the spanking?  Possibly.  You're going to get a Roman war helmet, are you?  You never know.  I try to be spontaneous.  I want to see DeeDee get a Roman war helmet from an Asian gentleman.  So it looks more like Roman goggles. 
[03:30:00]  This is Roman war helmets.  All right, nice try, DeeDee.  All right, I'll give you an update on Monday about how my weekend was.  All right, we'd love to hear about it, all right?  Okay.  One of our favorite people from Washington, DeeDee, everyone.  Bye-bye.  Bye, DeeDee.  And that caller said, we're the shielding best.  Eric Logan takes best to his barber.  We should play What Do We Learned today.  We haven't played that in a while.  Yeah, it was very educational today.  Let's go to Marion.  One half of the retarded, Laverne and Shirley. 
[03:30:30]  Hi, guys.  How we doing?  Hey, Beth.  How you doing?  Hey, Ben.  Hi, Jim.  Hi, Beth.  Make it fast, because there's not much of a buzz on your character anymore on this program.  Hey, come on.  Diane, so am I.  What?  We're working.  So?  I don't care.  Everyone works.  If we're not going to have to visit you, we both work, and she's working every day.  Oh, she got a job.  We're doing really good.  Yeah, I talk to her every day.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My took the over.  I don't care.  Yes, Marion.  She's doing it. 
[03:31:00]  And yours is even doing food with her drinking.  What?  She's doing it.  We shut that thing off.  All right.  What is she doing?  She's not even drinking anymore.  Yeah, sure.  Really?  And you know, she got a job offer yesterday to go work at Newark Airport in two weeks.  A job offer or an actual job?  No, a job offer.  She's got to go to Newark next week.  What?  As a 767?  You're going to use your panties as one of those things you put the bags through?  To work on airplanes and stuff.  That was minivan thing. 
[03:31:30]  To work on airplanes?  Yeah, to clean airplanes.  And now I do care.  What is she doing on a fucking airplane?  Yeah, what kind of job would she have there at the airport?  They told her.  She's going to go put an application the next week to go work at Newark Airport starting in the middle of May.  She's going to be cleaning the airplanes.  Cleaning the airplanes?  Yes.  She's working at Dunkin' Donuts right now, right around the corner from my house.  Oh, great.  Look for Dunkin' Donuts stock to plummet.  But she's doing good.  On unexplained resource loss.  I hear from her every day. 
[03:32:00]  As a matter of fact, yesterday, listen to me, guys.  We went for a walk yesterday.  She's lost a lot of weight.  Yeah.  No, she hasn't.  Yes, she has.  She hasn't.  It's all relative.  Yeah, she lost about 80 pounds.  It's called a son.  We cut him back on her drink.  And, hey, I've lost more weight.  So, hey.  But she wanted me to call you to tell you, don't forget about us.  We'll be up to visit you, hopefully, sometime soon.  She should get a job cleaning trains.  Oh, come on.  They could get a little messy on that cow catcher on the front. 
[03:32:30]  She has to windex the front.  Hey, guys, when you see her, you'll be amazed at how much she's changed in the last year.  Oh, yeah?  Really?  And her roommate is still around, and he's doing good.  That's just wonderful.  That's fantastic.  Everybody's doing good.  So, how's everything with you guys?  Shut up.  No.  No one wants to hear you asking how we're doing.  I miss you guys.  Come on.  I can't hear you guys that much in the morning because you've come on at 7, and I've got  to be in work before 7.  All right, Marion.  But I'm off today because I have a day off.  All right, Marion.  Thank you.  All right.  I wanted to call you to say hi. 
[03:33:00]  Thank you for the update.  And tell you that we miss you guys, and we still love you.  Thank you for the update.  Thanks, man.  Okay.  We'll talk to you soon.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah?  Bye.  Click.  Don't we have to play?  Never take a call from them again?  Well, there was a dare.  No, there was one time where the retard of Laverne Shirley gave us just great radio.  When they were doing movie lines?  Oh, they were doing movie scripts.  We would give them a piece of a script.  Right, right, right.  Well, they do, yeah, movie scenes from famous, famous movies.  They did Pulp Fiction once. 
[03:33:30]  Do you have a short clip there, Eric?  Not really, probably, right?  He's going through the whole thing.  That was my favorite was their scene from Pulp Fiction that they did.  All right, Eric's looking for it.  Oh, my God.  Lance Kroll's calling in.  The Lance Kroll?  Oh.  Are you kidding me?  Pop him on.  Lance?  What's up?  Hey.  Is this you?  This is moi.  Lance.  Lance Kroll.  Lance, I'm in trouble, Lance.  Talk about bad radio.  Are you guys ready for 10 minutes of awful radio? 
[03:34:00]  Really?  No, because if this doesn't flow, you're out of here in 45 seconds.  I know.  I know.  You better impress us in 30 seconds.  Just a flare.  Just a flare.  Actually, Lance.  I was actually on, I was supposed to go on with you guys about a week ago, and before  me was, who was it from SNL?  Black guy, really funny.  Tracy Moore.  Yeah.  And I was listening to this, and I was like, this guy is killing.  He's slaying.  And I'm just, I can't do that. 
[03:34:30]  We love the Tracy.  I was so nervous, and then they called, and they said, we can't do it today.  We'll have to reschedule.  Oh, thank God.  We actually got a cool bio on you, bro, and it says, this is actually interesting to me,  second degree black belt.  You trained for the Olympic team in 88 and 92, and you were ranked number three in North  America in Taekwondo.  That is correct, yes.  You still work out and stuff, right?  Yeah, I go to the YMCA and kick the bag.  I'm completely out of that element now.  I blew my knee in the middle of a fight. 
[03:35:00]  In 1996, and I did a spinning kick on my knee in midair.  It didn't hit anything.  It just twisted completely around, tore up all the cartilage, ripped out my leg.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Did Mr. Miyagi rub his hands together and put it on your leg?  No, I did not get up and do the crane.  I did not.  Dude, I don't take martial arts.  A friend of mine took it, and he said the key to martial arts. 
[03:35:30]  He's like, if you're going to be good at it.  He said, you know, I mean, it's about thinking, and a lot of times, you know, it's like, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  I agree.  Completely.  Lance Kroll of the Lance Kroll show on Spike TV.  What just happened?  Nothing.  He just, you know.  How was that?  I don't know why you're laughing.  I thought it was a good question, actually.  It's actually, well, it's about mentality, basically.  It's not necessarily, it's about the physical, but his point is that it's about the mental as well. 
[03:36:00]  It's like, it's.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know you were asking me a question.  You just sort of dropped off there.  No, no, no, no.  It's about a discipline, too, as well as physical.  Yeah, there was a question in there.  Yes, there was, it's totally mental.  I mean, you know, you've got a, you're in there, you're fighting.  I mean, people at that level are getting kicked the crap out of them, you know, and you have  to sort of, I mean, it's just like boxing.  It's the same thing, you know.  You have to, you have to believe that you're going to win.  You have to focus and all that.  Do you know Joe Rogan? 
[03:36:30]  Do I know Joe Rogan?  Yeah.  I've heard of him, but I don't know him.  Oh, he would give you a good fight.  He's a good friend of ours.  He's a comedian.  He hosts Fear Factor, and he's like, he's like you are, man.  He's like, he's an animal.  He's like a Taekwondo expert.  He's like a, he's like a real TV star.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  No, I agree.  I agree.  No, stop.  I just want to know what, what the Lance Kroll show is about.  I really don't.  I would like, I know.  You really don't.  No, can I, before you give the, you know, the, what the show's about, and then we go,  hey, thanks Lance for calling, and we all go home happy. 
[03:37:00]  Great.  I got to tell you one thing, though.  Uh-huh.  I was a huge fan of the Joe Schmo show.  Oh, thanks, man.  And I'm not even joking anymore here.  You're not even just saying that.  You were Kip the Gay Guy on the Joe Schmo show.  Who knew that Kip the Gay Guy could kick some serious ass?  Yeah.  Did you watch the Joe Schmo show, man?  I did, indeed.  I love, I'm not even kidding.  I love that show.  I thought it was a great, great gag.  It was fun, man.  It was, it was, uh...  I thought you guys could have got a little more vicious and stuff.  Basically, it was another one of these reality shows, pretty much taking, taking Big Brother 
[03:37:30]  and stuff, well, basically the whole reality show genre, and it was all actors except for  one guy, Joe Schmo, basically.  Matt Kennedy Gould.  And they controlled the whole game, and this guy had no idea that they were all actors  around him.  And I thought it was, it was a lot of fun to watch every week.  Yeah, it was.  A cliché and reality show.  You know, and we've got more vicious, but the guy was so delicate.  I mean, who knew he'd be so damn fragile?  He, like, you know, started busting out crying the first eviction ceremony when...  Yeah, that was really cool. 
[03:38:00]  ...that little guy laughed, and after that happened, we were like, okay, so we can't get,  you know, we can't go too far.  It was so hokey, and I, I mean, was he, come on, was he onto the gag at all now that the  show was over?  No, no, you know, it's funny.  I mean, all my friends thought, okay, the big twist is going to be he's in on it, and  he really wasn't.  He's really that completely immersed into that reality.  He thought that that was, you know, it was bizarre.  I mean, he still has a hard time accepting the fact that I'm not a gay Cuban, so...  Yeah, at the end of the show, they're kicking, you know, someone from the house out, 
[03:38:30]  right?  And they all had these plates, and they had to, when they, when the guy was voted off  of the girl, they had to take their plate up to the host.  It was ridiculous.  And the host, what's his name again?  It was a...  Ralph Garman.  Yeah, Ralph.  Yeah.  Who's, uh, he does a pretty good job, uh, doing radio for, uh, uh, Kevin and Bean, actually.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh...  I'm married, by the way.  Did he?  Not to a porn star.  And then he takes the plate and just shatters it in the fireplace every week.  And I'm like, come on.  Dust to dust. 
[03:39:00]  Yadda, yadda, you're dead.  It was a ridiculous reality show ceremony.  A great parody of those ridiculous ceremonies they did.  The whole show was a...  Yeah, exactly what I am saying.  A parody of the reality shows.  But, uh, I don't know.  There was something about it.  I loved it.  And then they tried to do a second season.  It didn't work.  It didn't work because they were, what, they were onto it?  Yeah, well, they cast a girl that was just way too smart for their own good.  And she caught onto it, like, day one.  And after about the third episode, she kept asking so many questions that they didn't want 
[03:39:30]  to pollute the other guys.  So they finally admitted it to her.  And then all of a sudden, she was now part of the game.  And it just got so messy.  And it just didn't have the same, you know.  It seems like one of the things with reality shows, because, I mean, it just seems like  they all start off one way, you know.  And then, like, just through the whole process, I mean, everybody kind of winds up not too sure.  Right.  That's a good question, Jimmy.  Why is this guy laughing? 
[03:40:00]  You're making no sense to me.  I keep thinking that you're saying a statement, and then I don't hear the question at the end.  You go, that's...  God, that is so weird.  I totally caught that one.  It's more about, like, they'll start one way, and they all seem just to morph into this,  like, odd, confusing thing that makes no...  They almost do it on purpose, because they think that putting the twist is more important  than doing interesting TV.  Oh, right, right.  That's exactly what you're trying to say, Lance.  I agree.  They all do it, too.  All right, Lance, what's the Lance Kroll show about? 
[03:40:30]  It is sort of my way of not being an insecure actor.  And I just said, well, no one's going to cast me, so I'm just going to have to make my own show.  And so I did, and Spike said, okay, we'll do eight episodes, leave us alone.  And so me and my buddies, we all grabbed the camera and shot a show.  I mean, it's, like, kind of an unbelievable experience as far as, like, absolutely no one  was telling us what to do. 
[03:41:00]  They just said, here's the money, see you at the premiere.  So it's basically 30 minutes of what we think is funny, and hopefully everyone else will, too.  Wow.  What are you going to do after the eight shows, there?  Hopefully make eight more, but if not, you know, use it as a really good show.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Now, Lance, Spike is actually getting, like, a lot of people are talking about Spike.  I'm surprised it's actually succeeding as fast as it is.  Spike TV?  Yeah, yeah, it's actually doing pretty good. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, I mean, well, they've got some, you know, I mean, you know, they've got wrestling,  which brings in the numbers.  It's sort of like NASCAR.  Like, I never watched NASCAR, but I hear it's very popular.  They've got MXC, which is, you know, hilarious, the dubbed Japanese game show, extreme game show.  Oh, I love that show.  Yeah, that's a good show.  That's still on?  Yeah.  I haven't watched it in a while.  You guys haven't even seen my show, have you?  No.  No, no, we can't.  Sorry.  Lance, we can't be bothered. 
[03:42:00]  We're big stars now.  Dude, you haven't watched it.  It's funny.  I'm telling you.  It doesn't look like anything else on TV.  It's a sketch comedy show.  I'm not pitching this as BS.  It is completely 100% independent made.  It's really cool.  It's got ninjas, samurais, prank calls, you know, drug-induced zombie rage.  It's got everything.  What do you think, a tough crowd?  I bet you it doesn't have teabagging.  It does not have teabagging, but it does have the playmate of the year.  She's in it a lot.  She fights the ninja at the end and bears her breath. 
[03:42:30]  You know what?  I think we're going to give this Lance Kroll show a peek.  Lance, everybody's writing in and saying you do a pretty good Chris Walken.  Sure.  It's not bad.  It's not great, but it's okay.  That's very good.  That is pretty good.  I'll give you that.  All right.  All right.  Do you have any other impressions or no?  No.  It's actually not bad.  Lance, why don't you give the big show a push as Christopher Walken.  Let's go. 
[03:43:00]  All right.  Please.  I implore you.  Please watch the Lance Kroll show.  It's got pee drinking, poop eating.  Put your finger in my ass.  My ass.  Give it a watch.  Lance Kroll is a hungry man, tired of eating ramen noodles.  All right.  There you go.  You're happy?  It's on Spike TV on Monday at 11 p.m.  Monday at 11 o'clock.  All right, Lance.  Thanks for being a good sport today.  We appreciate it.  Thanks, guys. 
[03:43:30]  All right.  Take care, man.  If you're in New York, come on by, then.  Please don't hurt me.  All right.  All right.  There he goes.  Lance Kroll, everyone.  Did you say thanks for being a good sport?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just won drama.  I was just trying to.  I was just.  Yeah.  Thanks for taking some ribbing.  You know, we've got to thank the guests.  We're putting up with our shenanigans.  Oh, and thank you, Dr. Steve, for my gift baskets, which I will share with the group.  Wow.  Look at that.  Jimmy, have fun in Boston, and have a good weekend.  We'll see you Monday.  Bye.  This concludes our podcast day. </pre>
