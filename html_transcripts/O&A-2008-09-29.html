<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the final game at Shea Stadium and the underwhelming closing ceremony. Opie and Anthony criticized the Mets' performance, the late arrivals and absences of notable former players, and Tom Seaver's poorly executed final pitch. They contrasted this with the closing of Yankee Stadium and compared the demolition approaches of both stadiums.  Humorous anecdotes, including a fabricated story about using the Stations of the Cross as an alibi, were interspersed with listener calls further commenting on the Mets and Shea Stadium.  The conversation then shifted to politics, focusing on Sarah Palin's perceived unpreparedness for the vice presidency, contrasting her with Joe Biden.  Clips from a Katie Couric interview and a Jack Cafferty segment criticizing Palin were played, prompting further humorous commentary.  The hosts briefly discussed the upcoming vice-presidential debate, the economic bailout, and other news items, mentioning upcoming guests Larry Charles and listener interaction, along with the possibility of a staff member's departure.

The show continued with a discussion of a controversial John McCain audio clip and Sarah Palin's purported belief in the coexistence of humans and dinosaurs. This led to a discussion of the inaccuracies in religious texts, specifically the Bible, and the Creation Museum. Paul Newman's death and the subsequent increase in sales of his films were discussed, followed by dark humor regarding death and funeral practices. Listener calls ensued, one suggesting the Flintstones as a source of the dinosaur-human coexistence misconception. The hosts referenced *Land of the Lost* and Chaka, making several offensive jokes about the character.

A significant portion focused on the HBO show *Little Britain*, with descriptions of various sketches, including sexually explicit ones. They promoted *Religulous* and other HBO shows. The "FU line" featured vulgar messages from listeners. A news story about a landlord secretly filming his tenants for 20 years sparked a lengthy and explicit discussion about voyeurism and personal experiences with peeping.  The segment concluded with further discussion about the landlord story, *Little Britain*, Larry Charles's upcoming appearance, and a co-worker's unusual haircut.

Larry Charles, director of *Religulous*, then appeared for an in-studio interview.  The discussion centered on the film's satirical examination of organized religion, its approach, and anticipated backlash.  Various religions were discussed, including Mormonism, Islam (with a humorous anecdote about gay Muslims in Amsterdam), and Judaism (including a Holocaust-denying rabbi). The Creation Museum and the lack of historical evidence for Jesus' existence were also discussed.  Humorous moments included jokes about religious narratives and unexpected encounters during filming, such as their expulsion from the Vatican.  The hosts and Anthony Cumia engaged in off-color banter, including jokes about sex, religion, and various stereotypes. An *Independence Day* bit, Stunt Brain's potential departure, and a listener phone segment on the film concluded this section.

A subsequent segment centered on listener calls discussing Jewish observance of the Sabbath and its restrictions on electricity use.  The hosts and callers engaged in numerous jokes and offensive stereotypes about Jewish practices, including Kaparos and "Shabbos Goyim."  The conversation included tangents involving a caller's repeated "Baba Booey" exclamations, a graphic anecdote about a woman's encounter with a Jewish man, animal welfare, a "toodly-doo" song, and a hypothetical "shitting your pants" competition.  A caller also shared humorous transcripts of angry interactions with Apple customer service.

The final segment opened with a call from Rich Hornack, who was verbally abused by the hosts. The main focus shifted to a story about George Brett allegedly shitting his pants in the Bellagio after eating crab legs. This led to caller stories about their own bowel movements, including one about a child with a prolapsed rectum. Political commentary interspersed with highly offensive language about John McCain and Sarah Palin was included.  A caller shared a story of finding a flatulence-impregnated pillow.  The hosts then discussed a Heather Locklear mugshot, making crude comments about her appearance.  Concerns about the financial crisis and the hosts' investments were discussed, followed by promotion of WebEx, with further crude jokes. Jimmy's attendance at a Bill Maher lunch led to a discussion about their past relationship with Maher.  The show concluded with off-color banter and announcements for the next day's broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Where do we begin today?  Hi.  What's going to happen this week on the Opie and Anthony show?  I think with us.  Hi and hearty.  How do you do?  Good morning.  Yes.  Stupid Monday.  You think there's someone out there that actually likes Monday?  Um, uh, yeah. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, there are people that, like, enjoy getting up early.  Ah, I love getting up.  I used to work with some people like that.  They'd be like, ah, I love getting up on a nice brisk winter day.  That brisk air just, ah, it wakes you right up.  Like, shut up.  Who wouldn't want to just stay in bed?  Bed rules.  Getting out of it sucks.  It's just the way it is.  Say no more, say no mo'. 
[00:01:00]  Although I was thinking yesterday, um, yeah.  With the job we have, with the ridiculous hours we keep.  Yeah.  Um, every day amounts to a Sunday.  Except for Friday and Saturday.  Now here's why.  On a Sunday, I'm usually asleep until after I'd be home on a weekday anyway.  So I sleep in, you know?  Because it's one of the few days I can.  So if I wake up at like 11.30, I'd have completed a full day's work and been home already. 
[00:01:30]  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  So, I wake up.  Theoretically, it's exactly like a Sunday to me.  I have to go to work the next day.  And I have the rest of the afternoon to kind of hang out.  So every day is Sunday.  Except Friday and Saturday.  Which is Friday and Saturday.  Every day is Sunday without the church thing.  It's been that way for many years.  Long time.  I don't think I've set foot in a church. 
[00:02:00]  Well, for weddings and, uh, Christenings.  What about like, uh, Christmas mass?  Uh, I don't do the Stations of the Cross during Christmas.  Really?  We used to lie that we were going so I could, um, go out with, uh, some girl.  You know, get her out of the house.  Yeah.  We tell her mother, who is very religious.  Very religious.  That we're going to the Stations of the Cross at St. Anthony's Padua Church.  And we would, um, hang out in the parking lot of the church. 
[00:02:30]  And do awful things that church-going people should never do.  Why would you do it in the church parking lot?  Just in case somebody showed up.  Mm-hmm.  You'd be able to keep an eye on the parking lot.  And then, you know, jigs up.  You gotta go inside.  Or you gotta come out and say, hey, how you doing?  Kind of a thing.  Gotcha.  So it was your alibi.  You just want, uh, people to see that you're near the church.  I'm at the church.  And then they'll report back to Rowe.  Say, yeah, I saw him.  I saw him at the church.  My mother didn't care.  What are you kidding?  She was, you know, into her own thing. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Who cares?  I bet she was crying about the Mets.  Oh.  Oh, Shea Stadium.  My old stomping ground.  Oh.  Rowe, he's saying it again, Rowe.  Don't make me call.  Look, last week was really wild on this show.  Well, that's the only thing that could get this, uh, this show even in more trouble.  He's doing it again.  No, no.  I didn't ask my mom how she felt about that whole thing.  Yeah.  All I remember back in the day is you're, uh, basically your father. 
[00:03:30]  He's been, Sal.  He's been your father figure for many, many years.  Yeah.  I remember that he threatened our lives.  It was pretty much, uh, yes, a threat of our lives.  Of our lives.  If we discussed any further, it was actually the listeners getting involved.  They ruin everything.  You think it was the listeners?  We knew the fine line to tread when we were talking about my mom and perhaps some, you  know, relationships she had had with some former Mets.  Uh.  So we were able to keep it like.  And Jets.  Uh. 
[00:04:00]  No Knicks.  Whew.  Thank God for that.  I'm a, I'm a Knick hater.  I don't want them in my house.  Jets, Mets, okay.  Jets, Nets, not okay.  No, no, no.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Football, a little football, a little, a little baseball, uh, no basketball.  So you're trying to say that we kept it, you know, between the lines and it was the  listeners that got us in deep trouble that day.  I think that what really put Sal over the top was when the listener called up and just 
[00:04:30]  started getting really rank about what my mom was doing with a Mookie Wilson.  Uh, that really kind of upset Sal.  So we steered clear of the subject.  Oh my God.  I know this is a national show, but, uh, got to talk about the Mets just choking second  season in a row, almost the exact same way.  They blew it so severe.  They had something like a three and a half game lead when we started paying attention again.  Yeah.  And that was, uh, with what?  Not that much time. 
[00:05:00]  No.  A couple weeks left in the season.  And it wasn't a three and a half games, you know, into the wild card.  No.  It was first place.  First place.  They were in first place.  Was there any doubt out there that the Mets were going to blow it again?  No.  Everyone knew.  You just knew.  They knew.  We weren't even talking about it because we're like, oh my God, this is so obviously going  to happen again.  Yeah.  But, uh, so they, they needed a win yesterday and they, they did not win.  No, they did not. 
[00:05:30]  And, uh, now, uh, that's it.  They're done.  Season's over.  Shea Stadium, uh, uh, that was it.  Last game played.  I don't know why people were so upset.  Um, obviously you're upset because your team lost, but the people that were there, now they  could say they were there for the last game play to check.  Yeah.  You don't have to, you know, no playoff games to worry about.  If they won, then they were going to play another game today.  Yeah.  Why aren't they blowing up this S-hole already?  What are they waiting for?  That place should just be gone. 
[00:06:00]  It's pretty funny, though.  No news, no newspaper fold-out, 20-page fold-out section on the history and the pomp and circumstance.  No.  And all that crap.  It's been, it's been kind of interesting here in New York to see two, uh, stadiums going down  this year.  Yeah.  You got the Yankees.  I'm, I'm not a Yankee fan, but you got to acknowledge the history and all the amazing  players that have played for the Yankees organization over there.  And then you got the Mets and Shea Stadium. 
[00:06:30]  It is too drastic.  Like, the Mets are stupid.  What they should have done was allow the Yankees to have their year.  This is the final year of Yankee Stadium.  Right.  Here's all the great, the Yankee greats.  We start in the new stadium next year.  Then the Mets wait maybe a year, maybe two years, and then they do the same thing.  To do it the same year.  Yeah.  It just shows how, how the organizations are completely lopsided.  There's a, there's a great organization.  And then there's the Mets.  Yeah.  And the Mets last, after, after the game, they, they, uh, they dragged out all the, the, 
[00:07:00]  and I'm using quotes, the great Mets, the, the stars of the Mets.  Wait, after the game, they did it?  After the game.  Yeah.  After the loss?  After the loss.  Oh, dude.  Dumps.  Dude, they are stupid.  It was perfect, though.  It was perfect.  Half the upper deck was gone.  Yeah.  Most people left.  Not most, but a good percentage of people left.  And then they're like, now I'm a Mets fan going way back.  I'm more old school Mets fan than, than, uh, you know, than, uh, current. 
[00:07:30]  Current Mets fan.  Yeah.  In general.  Because I'm more of a hot, whatever.  But, uh, they're dragging out people from, like, the heyday of the Mets, and I'm like,  that guy played, like, I think that guy played five innings for the Mets.  Here he is.  The five inning sensation.  You might remember him from.  Right.  From 1967.  Right.  But they had, uh, the announcer go.  Before we get started, just want to let everyone know that, uh, due to, uh, other obligations,  the following players will not be making the closing ceremonies today here at Shea Stadium. 
[00:08:00]  And it was a, it was an, it was the, it was everybody you want to see.  Uh, Davey Johnson will not be here in attendance today due to prior obligations.  He was the one that, you know, he's the manager of the 86, uh, World Series, uh, champions.  Oh.  And then they listed, Nolan Ryan will not be here, and just player after player after  player.  Joe Torrey.  Joe Torrey.  Yeah, I mean, people forget that Torrey was, you know, was, uh. 
[00:08:30]  You know who could have made it, and it would have been Cole?  No.  Billy Buckner.  Billy Buckner.  It would have been nice if he showed up, gave a little wave.  It's not a bad idea.  Kind of like tripped over first base, like a little goof thing.  It's not a bad idea.  And then they just dragged out the, the Mets, and they got Willie Mays, but what is Willie Mays  doing these days?  Come on.  But then again, I think Willie Mays played what?  One season?  One year.  One year.  And then, uh, so then they drag out these people, and some got, you know, some got, 
[00:09:00]  Mike Piazza got a huge standing ovation, and Tom Seaver, Tom Terrific was there.  Not too terrific throwing that pitch.  No, and then, yeah, the final pitch at Shea Stadium, he bounced it about eight feet before,  you know.  In front of, uh.  In front of the plate.  Piazza, right?  Because he's such a, ugh.  I had a run-in with him.  We've talked about it on the show where he hit me in a, in a charity softball game because  I got a hit off him.  Hank.  So he thought it'd be funny to throw a fastball at my head.  He's, he's not a nice guy.  He plays the game.  So, it was obvious that, uh, there's no way he's gonna make, get, get it to home plate. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  So he jokingly, like, uh, walks up a few steps and then waves off, like, nah, nah, I could  still do this.  Goes back to the mound, the rubber.  Yep.  And bounces this, this thing and then grabs the shoulder immediately.  And who was saying?  It's like the perfect way to, to close that S-hole.  Yeah.  I'm surprised they didn't, uh, somehow tie in the, the Jets.  That's what I was thinking last night.  To the, uh, the stadium. 
[00:10:00]  Because they, you know, they played there for a lot of years.  Well, a few years anyway.  I think the Jets, they wore their throwback uniforms yesterday.  Oh, is that what it was?  So maybe that was, yeah.  Maybe that was in tribute to, uh, Shea, they threw them, I don't think.  It wasn't even the, it didn't look like the uniforms they wore back then.  The Jets doesn't even know what he's talking about.  It actually looked like, kind of like a Green Bay uniform.  Yeah.  I think it was, uh, paying tribute to Brett Favarari.  That was, I think that was the, uh, the uniforms they, when they were the Titans. 
[00:10:30]  Yep.  Oh.  So that goes way, way back.  Remember the Titans?  Mm, yeah, that's, uh, a movie or something, I think.  Oh, but, uh, maybe.  Maybe they could have got some of the, like, the monster truck guys or something.  They did a monster truck event.  Monster truck show.  Could have gotten the Beatles.  The Beatles and maybe one of those guys.  A couple of them.  Maybe one of those daredevils that jumps over buses and stuff.  I'm not talking about the great Evel Knievel.  I'm talking about.  She's dead.  I'm talking about the, uh, the other guys that would get in their Fords and stuff.  Yeah.  Jump over buses. 
[00:11:00]  And then.  What about that?  The whole thing would explode.  But it was just, it was, it was, it was, it was,  it was so bad.  So badly done.  I don't know what else you could do.  It went out exactly as it should have.  Right.  In just a complete disastrous meltdown for the team.  Yes.  Uh, and no one gives a crap about this stadium.  And Tom Seaver just dribbling a ball to Mike Piazza behind home plate.  Yeah.  For the last pitch ever.  Good job.  And then him and Piazza walk all the way out to center field. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, well.  And, and at the same time, close the two gates.  What is it?  Mary Tyler Moore, the last episode.  Turn out the lights.  They were trying to make it into something.  There wasn't a tear to be had by any of the players.  No one cared.  And then this Tom Seaver, who was all about the, uh, the attention.  It was his day.  He comes back out on the field to get some of the dirt.  Oh, did he?  What is he going to do with the dirt from Shea Stadium?  Just take it off the ball you tried to throw to Piazza.  Yeah.  There's plenty of dirt on that one.  They should have done the, uh, eight o'clock game, and they should have done this all in 
[00:12:00]  the afternoon.  Of course.  Always lead up to it.  The public address announcer should say, well, that does it for Shea Stadium.  Take whatever you want.  Just ravage the place.  We don't care.  Just take whatever you want.  We know this stuff isn't worth crap on eBay.  Keith Hernandez was, uh, crying.  Is that true?  I didn't see no tears.  Goodness gracious!  Keith Hernandez is crying!  Apparently, Howard Johnson was, like, a mess.  Ho-Jo, as they called him.  Ho-Jo.  See, I didn't know how, how inside we wanted to get here, but Howard Johnson, he was dressed 
[00:12:30]  like he was going to play.  Oh, really?  And then I started thinking that...  That's funny.  No, because all the other guys, they had, like, just awful jerseys over there, like,  you know, suits and stuff.  Yeah.  But Howard Johnson was in full, I'm ready to play gear, and I'm thinking, I'm thinking  to myself, Ant, that this guy might be a little coo-coo-coo-coo-coo.  Oh, hey, put me in coach.  Still waiting for that phone call.  Yeah.  Because he, I mean, he was dressed from head to toe like he was ready to play. 
[00:13:00]  They're going to call me.  They're going to call me.  And I bet you if anyone, you know, interviewed him, which I doubt, he was probably going  to say, well, this is my original uniform, and I'm in, you know, I haven't gained a  pound since I retired.  Oh.  Did you hear Dykstra talking?  Like, two games ago, Lenny Dykstra was in the stands, and they started interviewing  him.  And remember when he rolled his car and kind of messed himself up?  He sounds like he's not right.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You're completely wrong, because Mr. Dykstra has made more money since retiring than playing 
[00:13:30]  Major League Baseball.  Really?  He's a bigwig on Wall Street.  I know he consults.  He's a financial whiz, this Lenny Dykstra.  Yeah.  I know he consults Kramer, but I had not heard him speak.  No, this Lenny Dykstra is a multi, multi-millionaire.  Well, he consults Kramer.  Like, Kramer asked him questions?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's close to brilliant when it comes to financing.  Wow.  Yeah, Lenny Dykstra, exactly.  He brought back this hole-in-the-throat guy, swabbing it with the key tip again.  Yeah, I see that, Ant.  Son of a...  Ugh, I hate that commercial. 
[00:14:00]  So, whatever.  Shea Stadium is now done.  Yankee Stadium is now done.  Now, what are they doing?  I know with Yankee Stadium, they're doing the slow disassemble.  Mm-hmm.  You know, are they doing the same thing with Shea?  Are they just going to dynamite the thing?  They should just dynamite the whole thing.  I love when they do that to a stadium.  Yeah.  And just collapse the thing.  Dynamite it.  Yeah.  How are they doing to the Yankee Stadium?  With a wrecking ball?  I think they're going in with white gloves and taking it apart brick by brick.  Seriously.  Oh, it's so sacred.  Yeah, they're taking their time. 
[00:14:30]  Probably because they could sell it.  Of course.  Yeah.  Every piece of that.  What's up, Travis?  Well, I think why everyone's calling is Howard Johnson's the hitting coach, so that's why  he's wearing this uniform.  Jesus Christ.  Travis goes, okay.  Travis goes, that's why they're all calling.  And here I am going, cuckoo, cuckoo.  Maybe he has to wear that.  Maybe he's got to wear it because, you know, he's with the team.  That's funny. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, is that...  Who knows?  Who cares?  That's classic.  They're done.  I was telling Anthony, now I can say it, like, I don't really watch the Mets anymore, so  when I talk about being a Mets fan, it's like more old school.  And I told Anne, I was watching the game yesterday, I'm like, wow, what stadium are they playing  at?  Because it looks so different.  And then I realized it's the brand new stadium that you can see in center field.  Yeah, right behind the stupid big apple that comes out of the hat.  The top hat. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, because old school fans...  We're so metropolitan, we're the Mets.  Yeah, old school fans know that as the empty space where you can see right into the parking  lot back in the day, but now there's a big brand new stadium there.  Looks kind of cool and everything.  They should leave them both up.  Just play, like, one day you play here, one day you play in the next one.  It's up to you that day where you want to play.  Just surprise everyone.  Don't tell the fans until the game starts.  Half of them are in one park, half in the other.  Yeah, you have both teams take batting practice in different stadiums, and then everyone 
[00:16:00]  has to rush to get into the next stadium.  How inconvenient that would be.  That would be awful.  Take all parking out.  Yeah, no parking.  Take a bus.  Oh, I'm getting killed on instant feedback.  Oh, my God.  My observation was great, though.  I'm thinking of Howard Johnson's cuckoo.  I'm just hoping that he can play again.  All right.  How did you get to hear the song?  Yes, what happened?  Do you want the song?  We love this song.  Ah, love this.  Greet the Mets.  Greet the Mets. 
[00:16:30]  Step right up and defeat the Mets.  Bring your kiddies.  Bring your white.  Guaranteed to have...  Worst baseball song ever.  The Mets are really sucking the ball.  Are they?  Knocking those home runs over the wall.  Not quite.  Side.  Side.  You'll see them everywhere in postseason except the stadium.  Meet the Mets.  BTS Mets.  The New York Town. 
[00:17:00]  New York Town.  Next little village.  Oh, no.  Where do they go?  To meet the Mets.  Oh.  Oh, they're hollering and cheering.  Florida.  It's not in October.  Where do they go?  To meet the Mets.  All the fans are true to the orange and blue.  Are they?  So hurry up and come on down.  Mm-hmm.  Cause we got ourselves a ball.  The Mets of New York Town. 
[00:17:30]  Give them a yell.  Go to hell.  You really smell.  Come on and meet the Mets.  Meet the Mets.  Yep.  Step right up and defeat the Mets.  This song is horrible.  It's still going on.  It's like auditory rape.  Guaranteed to have the time of your life.  Because the Mets are really sucking.  He's sucking the ball.  Not in the ball.  Because the Mets are really sucking their wives. 
[00:18:00]  We're all mad.  Everybody's coming down to meet the M-E-T-S Mets of New York.  New York Village.  Of New York.  Get it.  And the song says East Side, West Side.  Yeah.  No one from Manhattan goes to see the Mets.  East Side, West Side.  All around the town.  It's like Massapequa.  Like Long Island.  Right.  Queens maybe.  Right.  Not East Side, West Side.  Crips. 
[00:18:30]  Bloods.  Yeah.  Oh, see, there's another team for the East Side, West Side guys.  Yeah.  The Yankees.  Hey, really quick.  So, you got the Mets' last game at Shea.  Mets fans show some hope going into the stadium.  It was a rollercoaster ride of emotions at Shea today, as lifelong Mets fans said their  final goodbyes during this last game at the stadium.  All the magic, all the memories, all the times, you know, you thought you were counted  out and done.  Comeback, you know, magical comebacks, it's, you can't put it into words. 
[00:19:00]  So, there you go.  There's a hopeful Mets fan as he goes into the stadium.  Into the stadium.  And then you got out of the stadium.  But there would be no magical comeback on this final day at Shea.  The Mets lost to the Marlins 4-2.  Ending their hopes of winning the wild card.  What do you want me to say?  Two years in a row.  Two years in a row.  Going home.  For many, it was a heartbreaking way to end the season and stadium history.  However, fans say they will remain loyal to the Amazons no matter what. 
[00:19:30]  But I'm not going to be a Yankee fan.  I'm still going to be loyal.  But it just hurts.  It hurts a lot.  It hurts a lot.  I'm going to go home and cry now.  We still Mets lovers.  We love you, Mets.  All right.  All right.  Next year.  Next year.  Next year.  We love you.  Same time.  But a whole new place.  Next year.  That's the worst feeling next year.  Only because they blew it.  They had it and they blew it.  That's the worst.  Yeah.  If they were like the Yankees, we didn't even care this year.  The season was blown halfway through the season.  You know, it was completely over with the Yankees. 
[00:20:00]  So it wasn't like, oh, what a shocker.  They're not in the playoffs for the first time in like 15 years.  But the Mets, you just knew they were going to, you knew they were going to do the same  thing.  Sergeant G from Iraq.  The Mets should change that line, really suck in the ball to really suck in the fall.  That's a good one.  The Mets, the only team to take a three and a half game lead in September and lose it twice. 
[00:20:30]  Twice.  Yuck.  All right.  Did you see though, as far as the Yankees go, did you see Jeter all suited up like he  was playing?  Wait, he's cuckoo.  I can't even tell you how.  That's so funny.  I can't even tell you how uncomfortable I got as I give my brilliant theory and then  I look at the phones and I see every phone ring and I'm like.  He's bashing you.  I go, uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[00:21:00]  I think there's a problem with my brilliant theory.  What's he doing dressed in a uniform?  He's a bit cuckoo.  That crazy guy.  It's like he's still part of the team.  Oopsie.  The hell do we know?  Well, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're going to continue.  We're going to talk about the football.  The football.  We're going to talk about the Paul Newman.  We're going to maybe give you a hint to who's leaving this fine radio show of ours. 
[00:21:30]  A lot of speculation going on, but someone that's very important to this radio show will  be leaving in the near future and we're not happy about it.  And, uh, oh, uh, little Britain.  Religious.  Did you see Religious?  I did not.  I thought you were going yesterday.  No, I'm going to a lunch for it today.  I haven't seen it.  Oh, all right.  Oh!  I liked it a lot.  Yeah, we got Larry Charles, the director of the Bill Maher film, Religious, coming in.  Oh, good.  At 8.15, I do believe.  So we'll talk to him as well.  Opie and Anthony, stay there. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, good morning to everybody.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Lots of instant feedback coming in.  Scott from Hobpog writes,  Did anyone see Brett Favre dressed up in a Jets uniform pretending he was playing quarterback  for them?  What a crazy person.  He's crazy.  Yeah, that's all it takes is one screw-up on this show.  Well, speaking of which, Danny in Buffalo writes, 
[00:22:30]  Sure, Opie gets killed about Howard Johnson, but Professor Anthony slides.  Uh-oh.  Saying the Stations of the Cross are during Christmas instead of Lent.  It's during Christmas, dummy.  I don't know.  The Stations of the Cross on Christmas Eve.  I remember going to church, and you would go on all the Stations of the Cross.  Where, you know, this is this, this is that.  There's, like, all these stations around the church, and you'd go there, and the guy prays,  and then you'd go to the next station.  And if you go into any Catholic church, you'll see, like, a bunch of these little Jesus-like 
[00:23:00]  kind of carrying the cross, and then Jesus doing this, and, you know, all the little  things that tell the whole story.  I don't know.  But I know it's around, uh, uh, uh, uh, Christmas.  Know that?  Sure it's that light.  That was, like, the big thing.  It's Lent's around Christmas.  Lent's around Easter, I think.  Oh, this is different.  No, this was definitely a, uh, a, uh, Christmas thing, as I remember. 
[00:23:30]  Did you see that, um, homeless guy with the robes and, uh, the beard, and, like, he was  doing all these crazy miracles, and people were following him?  Oh, God.  What a nut he was.  What a kook.  Wouldn't you give up something for Lent that you wanted nothing to do with anyway?  Oh, yeah.  It was really easy.  Like, uh, like hats with beer cup holders.  I refused to wear one during Lent.  That was my big sacrifice.  Make it easy.  You do make a good point, because I think I, like, gave up, like, Brussels sprouts or something  stupid.  Something I ate once a year. 
[00:24:00]  Well, I gotta give up Brussels sprouts this, uh, this Lent.  Or yams spread on my tongue.  Right.  Just dump.  Right.  As a kid, though, that's what I did.  I wasn't giving up the chocolate or the collecting of the baseball cards or any of the stuff that  mattered to, uh, what, 11, 12-year-olds, you know?  It was always some dumb thing.  Yes.  No snow pee bubble gum, mother.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm giving it up.  Uh, well, the Jets had a big win, huh? 
[00:24:30]  Did they?  Yeah, the Pats had a bye week.  But, uh, we gotta start paying attention to the Buffalo Bills 4-0.  That's, that's the, that's the team right there.  Because when you say meltdown, you are talking about Buffalo.  No.  That is a team that just cannot close the deal.  Well, it's a, it's a, it's a new team.  Well, usually is every few years, but.  The guys that were part of the meltdown are long gone.  Well.  I just think it's a, so what are you predicting, a big win for Buffalo? 
[00:25:00]  Well, they're 4-0 all the way.  I'm starting to take a peek at, uh.  Oh, no.  At Buffalo.  Oh, no.  Poor Buffalo.  Spent a lot of time at Western New York and, you know.  Oh.  Even though Brett Favre, uh, had six touchdown passes.  Setting a record, by the way.  Ah, sets a record.  He beat Joe Namath's, uh, touchdown, uh, passing record there.  Oh.  In one game.  And it was a career.  Biggest drunken, uh, babbling to a bimbo record.  Yes.  Joe's pretty good at that.  It was a career high for Brett Favre, too.  He never did that with the Packers. 
[00:25:30]  Six touchdown passes in one game, so.  It'd be so great if he won a championship with the Jets.  That would just.  Oh, yeah.  Did he have a win with Green Bay, right?  Or did he?  Uh, go, pack, go.  Did he have a win with Green Bay?  Well, oops, keeping his mouth shut on this one.  I ain't saying a word.  Yeah, he did.  He did, but I was going back on the other thing.  He tied Namath's record.  I don't think so.  Namath had six TDs.  I heard, uh, I, I, I, I.  Last night, Chris Collinsworth said,  good company to be in, uh, with, uh, Joe Namath and Brett Favre.  I know it's early, but I think I just read in the paper that he, uh, set the record. 
[00:26:00]  I beg to differ.  Oh, boy.  Am I 0 for 2 today?  I'm usually pretty good.  I'm having a bad day.  Norm in, uh, Rhode Island.  What's up?  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Norm.  Hey, you dope.  The stations that are crass are representative of the crucifixion, which is light.  It has nothing to do with Christmas.  Then how come I would go and, uh, during Christmas and it would take hours?  You sit there and, and do all these, uh, uh, goddamn calisthenics in, in, in church.  I think you're doing calisthenics for the priest for another reason. 
[00:26:30]  No, don't try to throw that in.  I'm making sense here.  I know there was something going on.  Oh, he bailed.  He's right, though.  It's the crucifixion.  That's Easter.  I have no idea.  The, the stations of the cross.  Was it a midnight mass or something?  No, a lot of people do the stations of the cross throughout the year, and they're technically  the physical.  Those are the holy rollers.  But you can do them any time, and Lent just highlights it because it's the story laid  out there, and that's the, the end of the story finishes up in the stations of the cross.  What's the purpose of midnight mass? 
[00:27:00]  Uh, because, uh, like, Jesus.  Well, no, they sell playstations and the doors open and you run in.  Because I guess Jesus was born at midnight or something.  So you're kind of, like, celebrating the fact, oh, God, am I right about that one at least?  Look, uh, you know, I, I was sick all weekend, so I'm a little out of it right now.  Might be all the crap I, I took to, like, uh, get ahead of this thing before.  What's wrong?  Before it's full blown.  I don't know, like, uh, the, the heavy chest and the aches and, uh.  What?  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  What?  The same stupid illness I get every year, and it knocks me out for two weeks.  All right, five, six, uh, TD passes were once shy of the NFL game record held by Sid Luckman.  Yeah, all right, but.  Sid Luckman?  No, that's not the fact I was looking for, Travis.  Did he set the record for the Jets?  That's all we need to know.  Tied it.  Yeah.  He did tie it.  Yeah.  Tied it.  Well, where's that?  We are dumb as dirt today.  Where's that?  Sid Luckman's a queer.  All right, he tied NamUs record. 
[00:28:00]  I'm 0 for, oh, I'm keeping track.  I'm 0 for 3.  Why do you do the ceremony after the game?  I don't think, you, they should have made it a night game and done it before.  You lead, the climax is the game, you lead it up, especially.  Look at the Mets fans crying in the stands.  They don't want to leave.  Well, it's, it's Shea Stadium.  Who cares?  Everyone hated it.  Look at this.  It, it was the worst place to watch a baseball game.  It really is awful.  Like a giant toilet.  Why are people crying?  A giant toilet, yeah.  Yes.  Big, round, stupid stadium. 
[00:28:30]  Yes, Travis.  Just to answer Jim's question, traditionally, the last Sunday game,  games of the year, they're all day games.  There's no Sunday night game for the last game.  And they would do it after, because it's a 1 o'clock game, so you don't want to drag it.  Yeah, but they could have made an exception knowing it was the last game at Shea.  I'm with Jimmy.  But who cares?  Because here's the other funny thing about the closing of Shea Stadium.  Big, who gives a crap closing ceremony with all the old players no one cared about for  the most part.  95% of the players they dragged out, no one cared about.  I would name names, but people out there would be like, who was that guy? 
[00:29:00]  Did Strawberry show up?  Strawberry and Doc Gooden.  Doc Gooden showed up in gangster jeans, and I don't know what's going on with him,  but I think he's still down on his luck.  He doesn't look like he's doing as well as Lenny Dykstra and the rest of them.  And then they just decided to do fireworks.  It's at 6.15 here in New York.  Yeah.  Light out.  Thank you.  Thanks for getting the joke.  Yeah, 6.15.  It's light out.  And we're going to end with a fireworks display.  Big fireworks show in the daylight.  Honestly, it was perfect. 
[00:29:30]  A perfect end to a crappy stadium and a choking team.  Who does fireworks when it's still light out?  Yeah, it's...  They should have just aimed him at the team.  Yeah.  Watch him run around.  Is Ed Crane cool there or Bob Apodaca?  I don't think Bob was there, but, yeah, Mr. Crane cool was there, yes.  Who didn't show up?  You said Nolan Ryan didn't show up.  Nolan Ryan, Mookie Wilson.  No, Mookie? 
[00:30:00]  Davey Johnson, who, like I said, was the manager of the Mets when they won it all in 86.  What about Greg Nettles?  Greg Nettles is a Yankee.  I was wondering.  Wait, wasn't he?  Didn't he go to the Mets for like a week?  Oh, please.  Anthony's wrong.  Good.  I don't know.  No, I don't know.  I'm 0 for 3.  You're 0 for 2.  No, he retired from the Yankees, didn't he?  Who?  Greg Nettles?  I want to say he went to San Diego.  Did he go to...  Yeah, okay.  I could be wrong.  Oh, wait.  I'm only 0 for 2, not 0 for 3.  Brooklyn Ace, how are you, sir?  Help me out.  Good morning.  You're not 0 for 2. 
[00:30:30]  He tied that record.  That record it stood for 32 years with Namath at 6.  He tied it.  I swear, I either read it or someone...  Then someone gave me misinformation.  They said that he broke Namath's record.  So he tied Namath's record with 6 TD passes.  Okay.  Hey, and Jimmy, that was a great show Saturday night.  Oh, thank you, man.  You came to Poconos.  Thanks a lot.  Oh, Steve from Bayshore.  Oh.  He's wondering if Palin took her kid and painted little stitches, baseball stitches on his head 
[00:31:00]  and in celebration of the Mets, let him walk around like Lil' Mr. Met.  That's just insane.  Of course that didn't happen, Steve.  That Palin is as dumb as they come.  She belongs on this show this morning.  No kidding.  No kidding.  Who can't wait for the vice presidential debate?  Oh, it's going to be a good one.  That, I think, could be really good TV. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, my God.  We got a real slobber knocker here, King.  It is going to be a loo-loo.  I think so.  She made a couple of faux pas, I guess.  Well, they're basically saying when she talks off teleprop or off script, she's just a dummy.  Well, didn't she just say...  She can't think on her feet.  The same joke over and over.  She kept giving the same speech.  It's like...  Yeah.  Look, I know we've had some dumb vice presidents in our lifetime. 
[00:32:00]  You got to think Dan Quayle.  Dan Quayle, obviously.  Dan Quayle, probably the dumbest man to ever be vice president was Dan Quayle, yeah.  But this Sarah Palin, wow, she's just not ready for that position.  They ask her any question that means anything except these cutesy, you know, oh, you're a hockey mom.  What's that like?  You know, she can answer all those questions.  But they ask her anything that is of any relevance to the country, foreign policy, the financial meltdown. 
[00:32:30]  And she can't speak.  She doesn't know what she's talking about.  Yeah.  It's embarrassing to watch.  Yeah.  And, you know, I know we...  Well, not us.  Stunt brain started the rumor that Hillary Clinton's going to, you know, step in and take over for Biden.  But now there's people begging McCain to bail on Palin and said it was cute while it lasted.  But you got to get rid of her.  Ew, is that her?  Yeah, the swimsuit video is finally out.  That's an awful swimsuit. 
[00:33:00]  Well, it's back in the 80s, I think, so...  Dude, even in the 80s, isn't the swimsuit supposed to be a bikini?  It's a one-piece where the cut of the leg is so low down on the thigh that she walks like crap in those heels.  She got a little bunt.  It's 24 years ago.  She got a flab on her ass.  And look, she should not be in a beauty contest.  And look at her sporting 80s hair.  Oh, that's what she should be doing.  The video will be up on onaradio.com.  Sarah Palin in a bathing suit. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, she has hair like Marky Post.  Right, yeah.  Marky Post.  Pitching about her style.  She's just dressing for the times.  What do you got on that stump brain?  But people are actually talking about how, you know, they need to get rid of her.  Yeah, this was started by a conservative columnist who wants her out.  And it's a woman conservative columnist who says, listen, we got 34 days left, 33 days left.  Get her out now and put somebody in there.  You can't do that.  Can he do that or no?  No.  Sure.  That would be death.  No.  But they want her to step down.  They would turn around and bash the hell out of him saying, well, look at his ability to 
[00:34:00]  make a decision.  He can't even pick his own vice president.  And you want him for president.  They would kill him on that.  But he could always say that as a president, if something starts and I feel it's not right,  I'm not afraid that I'm going to look bad by stopping and changing it.  I'm not going to be so married to every decision I make that I can never admit something didn't  work.  People, they know they call it flip-flopping and waffling.  They don't call it change.  You can't change your mind if you're a politician.  I agree with Jimmy, but no one has ever done that. 
[00:34:30]  It would be, that would make a lot of sense.  But yeah, having her step down for some kind of reason, I don't know, going in for a womb  transplant.  That might, you know, she might be able to get away with that.  Yeah.  You know, I can't continue because I got things to do.  We forgot to mention, so after they mentioned all the ex-Mets, one by one, they touched  home plate for the last time.  Oh, yuck.  Watch Tom Seaver.  Look at that.  Oh, God.  What was that? 
[00:35:00]  Bounces eight to ten feet in front of home plate.  Hey, look.  Because Mr. Pompous Seaver can, you know, walk a little closer to the plate for the last  pitch.  Man, let's just watch him lose.  All right.  Anyway, let's say hi to Tom in Philly.  Hey, Tom.  Hey, Opie, Anthony.  How are you doing this morning?  You're out, Tom.  I got some bad news for you, Opie.  You're not having a good morning.  Uh-oh.  What now?  That Bill Maher movie is not called Religious.  It's pronounced Religulous.  Yeah, Religulous.  Oh, my God.  Opie is 0 for 3 now. 
[00:35:30]  Holy jeez.  Oh, my worry.  You just got to throw that in.  How did he say it, though?  I think he said it wrong.  He said Religulous.  It's Religulous.  They're going off ridiculous.  Right.  I know that.  Bill Maher's Religulous.  Yes, and we got the director, Larry Charles, who also directed Borat.  He's going to be here in about an hour.  This movie is going to get great success.  It's going to get a lot of people talking.  What, did he do a lot of interviews and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  Bill Maher is not a fan of organized religion. 
[00:36:00]  That's good.  Not a fan whatsoever.  It was kind of like mocking it and laughing pretty hard.  Did he give any of them a break, or did he kind of attempt?  No, he was pretty true to what he was doing.  How about Islam?  Did he really bash Islam?  A little bit.  A little bit, huh?  A little bit.  Yeah, sure.  A little bit.  Not as much as he went after the Christians.  He definitely bashed the Muslim religion, though.  Yeah.  A little bit, yeah.  And then he stayed away from Hinduism and all that.  The Eastern religions, he decided to leave alone because he doesn't know much about. 
[00:36:30]  I'd like to know why that is.  Basically, Bill Maher says that we need to get rid of religion to save the world.  That's the only chance we got is to get rid of...  John Lennon say that.  Get rid of...  Smart man shot in the back.  Right.  But he says that's our only hope is to get rid of religion or this earth of ours is doomed.  And religion is what's going to, you know, destroy it in the end.  Eastern religion probably affected him less anyway.  Like, when you're in the career as a stand-up or as an entertainer, you're more affected by Western religion. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, especially in this country, you know.  Yeah.  Catholicism and then, what else you got?  Judaism.  I love giving a good bashing to Islam as much as anybody, but the Catholics have caused much more problems for entertainers over the years, the Christians.  Yeah.  The Mormons, wow.  They got some crazy stuff going on.  Yeah.  Who's their god?  Joe Smith or something like that?  Yeah.  Right?  Joe Smith?  Joe Smith, who's going to be...  Stop.  Who's going to be sitting there up in heaven right next to God on Judgment Day. 
[00:37:30]  Joe Smith?  Joe Smith.  Terrible name that is.  Give me some facts on...  I hope that isn't his name.  I know.  Anyway, going back to the Sarah Palin.  I think most people at this point have heard Sarah Palin just sounding, what, confused?  Yeah, she doesn't sound like somebody who really knows what the job is, knows how to speak in interviews, knows how to handle tough questions, or even easy questions. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  She needs a teleprompter.  She's got to sit there and stare at it and read off of it.  Or she needs a cutesy speech about who she is.  Like that initial speech she gave when they first announced that she was the vice presidential candidate running with McCain.  She came out, gave a speech, it was like, all right, this woman seems, you know, a little inexperienced, yes, but she's got a handle on things, family, she's running things up there in the tundra. 
[00:38:30]  But now, as they dig a little deeper and ask her about questions about foreign dignitaries and problems in the world and in the country, she has not a clue.  The wheels are falling off, Anthony.  The wheels are falling off.  Most people heard her on the Katie Couric interview, but what we want to do right now is give Jack Cafferty props.  By the way, I hate Obama and I hate Biden and don't want them elected. 
[00:39:00]  I'd rather have the inexperienced vice presidential candidate in there with McCain than I would to have Obama in there with Biden.  Why do you feel like you have to say that today?  Everybody knows that.  You know why?  Because I would have gotten the, you know, you're liberal bashing, you're a liberal who's just.  I like people knowing where my stance is.  Yeah, but you tell like it is, though.  I still say, vote for McCain.  All right, listen.  I'm endorsing McCain.  I love those emails you get from people where if you don't like, if you bash Bush, who deserves to be bashed, you're accused of being a liberal. 
[00:39:30]  A liberal.  It's like, have you ever listened to this show, you idiot?  All right.  Here's Jack Cafferty, an old salt who tells it like it is.  He's miserable.  He tells it like it is more than most of these guys on CNN and MSNBC and Fox.  This guy tells it like it is.  He's miserable.  Oh, I know.  It's a cranky ass, this guy.  He's a local dude from New York.  Of course he is.  He used to be with Sue Simmons there.  Yeah, he's been doing CNN for a while now, but I think it's CNN, right?  Yeah.  Please, please, please.  They tried to fire him.  Remember they tried to fire him for the China comment? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  They thought they're all good.  He wouldn't leave.  The Chinese government.  Oh, I'm right.  It is Joe Smith.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Here's Jack Cafferty on this.  Just one.  This is Jack Cafferty's, you know, angle on the whole Sarah Palin, Katie Couric thing.  Why isn't it better, Governor Palin, to spend $700 billion helping middle-class families  who are struggling with health care, housing, gas, and groceries?  Allow them.  Now, listen closely to Sarah Palin answer this question.  If you haven't heard this yet, it's just amazing. 
[00:40:30]  Listen to the question closely, too.  Right.  You can really get a grasp on what the question is and then listen to her answer.  Right.  Why isn't it better, Governor Palin, to spend $700 billion helping middle-class families  who are struggling with health care, housing, gas, and groceries?  Allow them to spend more and put more money into the economy instead of helping these big  financial institutions that played a role in creating this mess.  That's why I say I, like every American I'm speaking with, we're ill about this position 
[00:41:00]  that we have been put in where it is the taxpayers looking to bail out.  But ultimately, what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health care reform  that is needed to help shore up our economy.  It's got to be all about job creation, too, shoring up our economy and putting it back on the right track.  So health care reform and reducing taxes and reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions 
[00:41:30]  and tax relief for Americans.  And trade, we've got to see trade as opportunity, not as a competitive, scary thing,  but one in five jobs being created in the trade sector today.  We've got to look at that as more opportunity.  All those things under the umbrella of job creation.  This bailout is a part of that.  That bitch is stupid.  Holy mother of God, what is she babbling about?  My favorite part of the clip is in the middle there. 
[00:42:00]  She goes, oh, oh, oh, that's the point I wanted to make.  This non-point.  You ever been, you know, in the middle of an exam during high school?  Yeah.  And then, oh, oh, I think it might be.  Job creation.  I'm going to go with job creation.  Yeah.  I'll see the apple didn't fall far from the tree.  Hey, well, just to finish up then, Jack Cafferty, this is the reason we're playing it today.  Right after that clip, Jack Cafferty had this to say on CNN.  Did you get that? 
[00:42:30]  If John McCain wins, this woman will be one 72-year-old's heartbeat away from being president of the United States.  And if that doesn't scare the hell out of you, it should.  I'm 65 and have been covering politics, as you have, for a long time.  That is one of the most pathetic pieces of tape I have ever seen for someone aspiring to one of the highest offices in this country.  That's all I have to say.  Yeah, but she's cramming a lot of information.  There's no excuse for that.  She's supposed to know a little bit of this.  She's a stupid bitch.  Don't make excuses for her.  That's pathetic. 
[00:43:00]  It was not her best answer.  I agree with you on that.  Thanks, Jack.  And way to go, Jack Cafferty, because that wolf blitzed her.  Yeah, he goes, it was not her best answer.  I agree with you on that, Jack.  That isn't what Jack was saying.  Jack was calling her adult.  That's right.  Pretty much.  Shut up.  And he's just like, ah.  Shut up, wolf, and let Jack say what he's going to say.  Jack has his own agenda, too.  Yeah.  You know, he's obviously a little biased.  At least he's honest.  But, yeah, I mean, that was a horrific answer to a relatively straightforward question. 
[00:43:30]  You know, why should these people that are suffering not be bailed out, but the taxpayers  are now footing the bill for this giant rescue of these financial institutions?  So how does that help the people?  All right.  Well, then you give a little answer.  I have a question.  Is the bailout, are they doing the bailout, and who is pushing for the bailout?  Yeah, we're doing the bailout.  Kind of.  Yeah, it's pretty unilateral at this point. 
[00:44:00]  I mean, the Republicans are the ones that were, which is odd.  They were giving Bush really more crap than the Democrats were about this thing.  Well, the White House put out a three-page plan for up to $750 billion.  Then the Democrats made it 100 pages with a bunch of junk going to weird programs.  They always do that.  They always do that.  So the Republicans went, hold on a second, and they were demonized.  But now it looks like they got it settled.  We're just going to destroy ourselves in the end.  Well, it's not going to be like the Middle East or Korea or any of these other places. 
[00:44:30]  It's going to be ourselves.  We're going to just destroy this country ourselves.  We're going to implode.  It's a weird thing.  There are two schools of thoughts on this buyout thing and this actual rescue that's going on.  Some people say, why not give the money to people that need it, that have lost their homes, that are in foreclosure.  And then other people say, you can't just let these huge institutions that have been around for years just wither and die, even if they did do it. 
[00:45:00]  It was their own mistakes and mismanagement that did it because these companies do make jobs and they help the economy out more than just doling out money to people who spent too much money.  They spent money above their means.  Regardless of if they were talked into it by some mortgage shyster, they screwed up, they made a mistake, and now they're paying for it.  Should we as taxpayers pay for that, or should we pay for an institution that through mismanagement is all screwed up, but it's very valuable to our economy? 
[00:45:30]  So what do you do?  What do you do?  Well, I say what you do is get more naked chicks on this radio show.  Well, that would help.  That would help the economy.  It's the trickle-down theory.  It's what happens on your leg.  Trickle-down theory.  You wear boxers.  That's the trickle-down theory.  That's what I was getting at.  I wear tighty-whities.  Knowledge is good on this show, but let's keep it. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, someone is suggesting, is it Brian?  Brian's saying the Sarah Palin answer there is pretty much like a beauty pageant contestant.  Oh, wow, yeah.  You know, answering one of their dumb questions.  What do you hope for the world?  I want to work with handicapped children.  Not that closely.  Mm-hmm.  I think what you need, like I said, is an Indian, when they beat that CEO to death, a few more 
[00:46:30]  of those, a few...  How about one of those in America?  One of those guys...  It would take one.  ...begged out and beaten to death by all the people they screwed.  Oh, that'd be great.  That'd be great.  That would keep people in line.  Yeah.  Take them to the soccer field and behead them.  Oh, wait a minute.  We should have, like, Third World Nation Day.  One day we get to do stuff that they do in Third World Nation.  Where we just cut off hands for theft and cut out tongues and pluck out eyeballs, things 
[00:47:00]  like that.  One day a year we go to Third World Nation.  Can you imagine?  I like it.  You would clean up this country for one day.  You would get people thinking, you know, whatever, behead people in the middle of Central Park,  just all over the place.  Third World Nation Day.  Take care of all family business day.  That's right.  That's right.  All right.  We got to take a quick break here.  I want to ask Ann if there was any fallout from Friday's show, because everyone's talking 
[00:47:30]  about Friday's show.  Wherever I go, that's all they want to know.  Fallout.  Is that a joke?  No.  No, there was no fallout.  All right.  Well, that was...  I just put it out of mind.  I just continued.  I had a good weekend, even though it was raining and a little bit cold.  Jacuzzi time.  My nice, hot jacuzzi, Jimmy.  Well, maybe I'll find out this Friday or Saturday. 
[00:48:00]  Yes.  When I stop by.  Cordially invited.  Ooh.  Of course.  Did you...  Were you living the life of Guns N' Roses this weekend, Ann?  A little bit.  Or more the life of...  Not zebra.  Living the life of zebra.  I was trying for a wimpy band.  Oh.  Yeah, I was living the life of...  James Blunt.  Michael Bublé.  Bublé.  Air Supply.  There it is.  Steve from Bay Show.  That's the one I was looking for. 
[00:48:30]  Living the life of Air Supply.  Going to bed early.  Yeah.  Taking care of my voice.  Blue Heeler.  He's a regular from Kentucky.  God damn it.  Obi-Sara Palin isn't the only VP candidate to talk nonsense this week.  Joe Biden has misspoken many times.  Why does he get a pass?  He does not get a pass, my friend.  We played some of that audio last week of Biden just babbling.  And Biden, at least you feel like, has a lot of foreign policy experience.  But do we know, do we know, honestly, I've heard that before, too.  Do we know if that's good or bad experience? 
[00:49:00]  I don't know.  I'm basically repeating what I heard.  Well, last week, Biden was talking about how his helicopter got forced down over Afghanistan  and made it sound like it was real dramatic.  It was a snowstorm.  Yeah.  Hello.  I heard you say that before.  Jimmy just stole his thunder.  I could have totally hijacked his point.  That's all right.  But yeah, I look, we all, it's amazing how we all repeat what we hear.  Like, you say it as fact, but like, I don't know if you said to me, all right, here's  a gun at your face. 
[00:49:30]  How many, tell me some of his foreign policy experience.  I'd go, I don't know.  But a man said he had some.  He has the experience.  I don't know what it is.  If it's good.  Yeah.  Hitler has experience in government.  Yeah.  You know, it was like, doesn't mean a lot of people would like it.  He's been on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Oh, I know that.  For like two decades.  Since you've said it, I know that now.  So, as of 30 seconds ago, this should keep the fine listeners tuned.  Landlord peeped on female tenants for 20 years. 
[00:50:00]  We will tell you about that after the break.  Also, some props to Bobby Lee.  Yeah.  Maybe we should get some of that audio for the show.  I was, I spent the weekend pretty much being sick and I was just watching way too much TV.  I felt like Anthony.  I'm like, wow, this is what Anthony does all the time.  It's kind of cool to watch a lot.  I just watched TV.  And I came upon Mad TV, which is just god awful.  They also have some broad doing Sarah Palin and you compare it to Tina Fey. 
[00:50:30]  It's like, why would you even do a Sarah Palin thing when Tina Fey is doing such a great job with it on SNL?  But Bobby Lee as John McCain.  Oh, my.  That's funny.  That is funny that they dressed him up like that.  Maybe the boys in the office could get a few clips, especially the clip where they try  to take his picture and Bobby Lee as John McCain completely freaks out.  That's all we'll say.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Try to play that on this station.  Oh, you don't think we can?  Sure.  Go ahead.  Holy ass.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:51:00]  Play it for him.  Are you kidding me?  Play it for him and you tell me if they would allow that through.  Okay.  Play it for him during the break.  Play him the clip and see if he says yay or nay.  Could you do that?  Yeah.  As a nice exercise?  Why couldn't we play it?  Oh, are you kidding me?  You don't have to make sense.  It is.  It's just that this is what it is.  It's hilarious.  I know damn well.  Yeah.  Well, good luck.  Good luck to you.  I got 20 says it's good.  All right. 
[00:51:30]  We'll find out after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony on a Monday.  Yuck.  Tina Fey all over TV with this Sarah Palin impression she's doing.  Sarah Palin also said in the L.A. Times that humans and dinosaurs walk the earth at the  same time.  That's that religious thing.  Oh, my God.  Do you really believe that?  People believe.  Earl believes that.  A lot of people believe that.  Our own Earl.  A lot of people believe that one, Jimmy. 
[00:52:00]  believes that that that dinosaurs.  That's how they explain the dinosaurs.  After so many years of just not acknowledging dinosaurs.  You know, for so many years, the church is like, no, didn't exist.  No, we don't know what you're talking about.  It's poppycock.  And then they decide, all right, there were dinosaurs, but they were around like, I don't  know, a few days ago.  They make these things up to keep their funny little storybook relevant. 
[00:52:30]  Well, yes.  Palin didn't say that.  That story is from a teacher who claims Palin said it to her.  So they don't have a clue.  Believe it.  All right.  I believe it then.  Religulous.  The director, Larry Charles, coming in today.  And they talk about the dinosaur human thing in that movie.  Because there's a creation museum.  A creation museum.  Yeah, somewhere.  I don't know where it is, but they went to the creation museum for this movie, Bill 
[00:53:00]  Mardet, and they show a dinosaur with like a saddle on it, basically suggesting that not  only did humans and dinosaurs walk the earth together.  Yay, we rode them.  Yeah, the humans rode them like horses.  It's funny, all those cave drawings, you don't see a lot of drawings of dinosaurs.  They're all buffalo and things that we know existed.  You don't see a lot of T-Rexes carrying people off.  Not one, yeah, cave painting of a dinosaur.  Religious people, you're just boobs because you won't. 
[00:53:30]  I mean, it feels like, ah, religion's so easy to attack, but it's like you just make  yourself such fun targets.  Yeah.  It's like you don't ever bend.  Yeah, because there's this mentality that no matter how educated we get and how much  knowledge we get throughout the years to figure out where we came from and where the planet  came from and timelines and stuff, there's scientists working diligently every day.  And they just cannot accept anything that comes out of the scientific community that 
[00:54:00]  might contradict what their book says.  And I'm talking about a few religions here, you know.  That book is unbending.  You cannot, you can't say, hey, we did some research on this.  This is absolutely wrong.  No, it's not.  It was written by some guy that was drinking a lot of wine or a bunch of guys that were  drinking wine a bunch of years ago.  Actually, it wasn't even that.  They said it and someone else heard it and decided to write about it. 
[00:54:30]  You can't tell, like, your buddy plans for the weekend and have him tell another buddy  without screwing the whole thing up.  Yet thousands of years go by of translations and other crap.  And this book is, you know, gospel.  I think it was 300 years after Christ died, they voted.  The Bible is a bunch of stories.  Like, there was a bunch of them left out.  But I think they voted on the most popular ones in the ceremonies.  And those are the ones that became the Bible to kind of make the religion. 
[00:55:00]  This is the book.  Yeah.  It wasn't like it was like this is what Christ wrote.  It's like a bunch of hundreds of years.  Yeah.  Put it together.  A lot of people like this is the word of God.  No, it was his greatest hits.  He had some flops in there.  The greatest hits.  That's his greatest hits.  The Bible is the greatest hits.  I want some of the $1.99 rack tracks.  Yeah, I want the songs they just throw on the greatest hits album at the end.  B-sides.  Right.  A couple B-sides.  You can't say that because Ted in a letter to the Corinthians said.  Ted. 
[00:55:30]  Who are the Corinthians?  Enough of the Corinthians.  I don't know.  Enough of their mail.  Who cares about their mail?  All the time, the letter to the Corinthians.  I'm thinking Ted the Disciple.  I don't know.  He might make a business day on the show.  Dear Corinthians.  He turned water into Diet Coke.  I read that once.  He turned bread into toast.  Me and Danny were just doing Ted impressions over the weekend.  It's kind of fun.  It is so much fun to do Ted.  It's freeing.  Ted is freeing. 
[00:56:00]  It certainly is.  He drops all inhibitions.  Ted.  Good news.  Bobby Lee as McCain.  The clip we want to play.  We can play it.  Really?  It looks like they're going to give us one today.  Gee, thanks.  That was my strategy.  Oh, good.  To just bash it and make it sound silly if you said no.  Good, good, good.  And we've got to acknowledge that the great Paul Newman passed over the weekend.  What?  I didn't hear anything about that.  Oh, my God.  I know.  You know what's weird when someone really famous dies?  I was reading in the paper today.  His movies, and I quote because it said in the paper, flying off the shelves. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  What is that about?  He's dead.  I've got to see him.  Yeah.  What is that about in human nature that someone really, really famous dies, and then you've  got to go out and get all his movies and stuff?  Yeah.  That's the weirdest thing to me.  I think I have a guess at it.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Because when they die, they're in the forefront of your mind.  Like, oh, yeah.  I haven't thought of Newman in a while.  Oh, Christ.  He did do that and that.  You're like, oh, yeah.  I liked him.  I did want to watch Slapshot this weekend.  Did you?  I could watch it any weekend, but for some reason, maybe Jimmy's onto something because 
[00:57:00]  I was sort of doing the same thing.  I'm like, I want to watch Slapshot because he died.  Yeah.  And then I couldn't find Slapshot anywhere.  I thought I had a copy.  Well, you've got to pick up the Paul Newman box set.  They have all those?  Well, it's at the Hollywood Funeral Home.  Whoa!  His pine box set.  Comes with a little satin pillow in it.  All the movies are resting gently on it.  Satin pillow.  Oh, it's just creepy.  It's not used for anything else. 
[00:57:30]  It's not comfy.  No, satin pillows are awful.  Could you imagine laying on your couch, watching a movie over the weekend or something, with  a little satin pillow behind your head?  I can't.  My hands over my chest?  Yeah.  In a suit?  No.  Satin pillow is made for a head that's never going to move again.  Yeah.  Just kind of lay it there.  Ugh.  The little indentations that come out when your head is laying.  Oh, yeah.  Never to change.  For eternity.  Until maybe your head falls to the side when it's the skull, and your jaw goes, nah.  Ugh.  The problem I have is, like, when you go to these open casket wakes and stuff, and the 
[00:58:00]  person's laying there perfectly, and then you know you get some dumb cemetery worker  that kind of just throws you in the ground, and now your body's not perfect anymore.  Oh, what if you tilt it uncomfortably?  You got a crook in your neck for eternity.  Oh, that's got to hurt when you wake up.  Because some, you know, minority decided to just throw you in the hole.  My neck hurts.  I think I died funny on it last night.  Well.  If you ever go to a...  I think I talked about...  I missed it, though. 
[00:58:30]  I'm just throwing them out there.  It doesn't matter.  But if someone out there is laughing...  Nope.  It's all right.  We all missed a joke together?  Yeah.  That's good.  Listen on the replay, and don't laugh then, either.  I didn't hear it.  Good.  Let's go to Pittsburgh, Bob.  I heard it.  I know he did.  I saw the Jimmy smile.  Zeno in Philly, we already talked about the Mets collapse.  I'll acknowledge it.  Nothing but freaking phone calls from the Philly crew all weekend long. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  A lot of laughing.  I bet.  Mocking.  Bob in Pittsburgh, how are you, sir?  Hey there, Bab.  Yeah, pretty good.  Hello?  Let's speak and be spoken to.  Bobby, let's go.  You've been listening to the show.  You've got to jump in.  There's a mention on the Sarah Palin thing, but the Dr. Miller, maybe she was watching  like the Flintstones when he was seeing it?  Well, I think a lot of people think that the dinosaurs and humans walked the Earth at  the same time because of some of the movies we watched growing up.  Yes.  And the Flintstones and some other things. 
[00:59:30]  One Million B.C. with Raquel Welch.  There's been a few of them.  Sorry, guys.  I don't know.  It just makes a better story thinking that.  Yeah.  Humans and dinosaurs were...  Would you be scared if you...  Land of the Lost.  Land of the Lost.  Remember Chaka?  Chaka, he was the cutest thing.  Was he?  Yeah.  How great would it be if you have a Bic lighter and Chaka just to see him running around  like a monk?  Yeah.  They were all...  A protester.  It was so nice to him and he was supposed to be a little cutesy.  But you know with all that fur and he didn't have toilet paper. 
[01:00:00]  It's just a mess back there like a bear.  Looked like he was lugging around a bunch of coconuts.  Why does Chaka always have a coconut seat with him?  Chaka sucked.  Chaka just reeked.  Hope he died of a brain tumor.  Chaka's a queer pillow biter.  What noise did he make?  It was just awful.  What was Chaka's...  Oh, what was it?  We had Chaka.  Somebody did it on our show recently.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  What was the Chaka?  The Chaka noise.  Yeah.  That show was so incredibly bad.  They could not make it look faker.  If you tried, you couldn't make a background look more fake.  They were constantly running away from a movie screen.  It was just awful.  Hey, um...  People believe it.  Really fast because we had the guys in last week.  That little Britain on HBO.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I've been watching that.  Those guys will never be on our show again. 
[01:01:00]  They are going to be freaking huge in the States.  They're massive in Britain.  They're massive in Britain.  We didn't know much about them.  They came in to promote their HBO show that started over the weekend, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  Man, if you got HBO on demand, take a peek at little Britain.  Some of the best characters ever developed, really.  Yeah, really funny.  You know, they get a little risqué.  Oh, yeah.  They're not into that PC crap, that's for sure.  That's good.  That's really good. 
[01:01:30]  I saw most of the first episode.  It was very funny.  And I forgot the sketch.  We talked about the sketch about the cop.  You can't say much, but let's just say the cop was becoming visibly excited holding guns.  Yeah.  Doing the gun display.  And then when the visual excitement ended, and it was apparent on the front of his clothes  that the visual excitement was over, he just dropped the gun and said, all right, I want  to go on to something else.  Yeah.  It was really funny.  Yeah.  He was showing off all the guns to, what, the recruits or his boys, yeah.  HBO had a lot of-  And as the guns got bigger, well, what he was sporting got. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  HBO is just a great-  They have the greatest shows.  Dude, the gym bit is so effing funny.  I didn't see that one.  They-  They're gymnasium guys.  They-  They're just completely naked.  In these giant muscle suits.  In these, like, Arnold Schwarzenegger ripped giant, yeah, naked muscle suits.  And they're sporting tiny little peens.  Yeah.  They're really, really underdeveloped down there. 
[01:02:30]  And they take their towels off, and they're just acting so gay with each other.  They're supposed to be real macho.  But I guess they're not gay.  It's just over-the-top macho.  And the one guy-  At one point, one guy's bent over a bench, and the other guy's doing things.  And the other guy, I wish we could talk about that.  Yeah, it's just one of those things.  But anyway, just want to give some love to Little Britain, if you haven't checked it out  yet, on HBO.  Very, very funny.  Dude, you should watch-  Very edgy.  And Bill Maher even has a great show. 
[01:03:00]  Bill Maher, the Religiousist, has a great show on HBO on Friday nights at 11 o'clock.  It's a great, great channel.  No, see, that was a down-and-dirty plug for Jim.  No, it wasn't.  Of course it was.  Yes, it was.  Down-and-dirty is at midnight.  That has nothing to do with Bill Maher.  You're on after Bill Maher on HBO, which is a great spot to be, especially now because  of this movie coming out.  That means more people are going to watch Bill Maher on HBO, and they're going to be sitting  there all nice and comfortable, and then they're going to watch Jimmy's Down and Dirty  on HBO.  I hope so.  You know what I saw over the weekend, too, is it's been obviously out for a long time. 
[01:03:30]  For your consideration, it's like Christopher Guest, another one of those kind of weird,  quirky documentary things on the film industry, indie films and stuff, but not his best work,  but Gervais is in it.  And I didn't realize that until we really started getting into Ricky Gervais and stuff.  And again, just brilliant.  He stole the friggin' movie with a very small part as just a sleazy movie executive in a 
[01:04:00]  suit.  And just the whole thing of how he wants to come in and change everything, but he does  it in that way.  It's like, you know, with his little wrinkled nose and...  Right.  Yeah.  Very, very funny.  So if you get a chance to see that, to see Gervais.  He's great.  He's great.  Ricky has a great little head nod he does.  It's like a little move to the left and the right, like, eh, with the nose.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's so great at just being a casual scumbag.  Yep. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, I want to talk about little Brent a little more, but most of the stuff he can't even  talk about here.  Which is good, because then you watch it and it's hysterical.  There's a few clips on YouTube if you don't want to wait, just to, you know, check out  as you're, you know, at your miserable job in your miserable cubicle where you can't  hang up anything anymore because, you know, the do-gooders at your work are...  They won't allow it.  They won't allow it anymore.  Arr!  Pirates!  More pirates.  Arr!  Did you hear about this whole thing? 
[01:05:00]  Did you hear about this?  Oh, my.  Jesus Christ, I'm a dolt.  You can't go off the coast of Somalia in a boat, apparently.  It doesn't matter what you're hauling.  These pirates are hijacking ships and then just taking whatever they want.  Money, goods.  Mm-hmm.  And now the latest thing is they got a ship full of old Russian tanks.  And they appear to be like just a couple of Somalians with a few RPGs, some machine guns, 
[01:05:30]  on these little, little boats.  And they take over these ships.  Container ships.  They've been killing a couple of people.  What the?  That's where you ought to send our tug barges with all our garbage from New York?  Yeah, take it.  Oh, they'd love it.  No, don't take that.  They would love it.  They'd eat forever.  A bunch of AIDS needles.  Here, don't take those.  Everything we don't want. 
[01:06:00]  I don't think they need many AIDS needles over there, to tell you the truth.  But 2008, we shouldn't be dealing with pirates.  There's no pirates.  I don't get that.  And just because it's on the open sea, I guess, they got to call them pirates?  Yeah.  That sounds like a pretty dated name.  They don't look like pirates.  Yeah.  It's like the news reporting, you know,  and a rogue went into a bodega today and robbed it.  Yeah.  A rogue.  No.  No, they kind of updated it to criminal.  Oh, that robber. 
[01:06:30]  That's also a pirate.  Yeah, he's a pirate.  They're all pirates.  Some scallywag.  Right.  Why are they romanticizing what these animals are doing?  It's not because they're pirates.  You hear pirate now, you think pirates of the Caribbean.  This isn't a Johnny Depp thing.  I'm thinking Johnny Depp stumbling around with an English accent.  Not a bunch of toothpick Somalians with RPGs that are fatter than them.  Right.  There's no walking of the plank.  There's no eye patches.  There's no goofy triangle hats. 
[01:07:00]  No.  I'd like to try it.  And the parrot and the one arm or the one leg.  None of that fun stuff with these pirates.  Right.  That's for sure.  Right.  I don't think you could barter with them either.  I don't think you could step up and say, you know, make a deal.  They don't sing any good pirate songs either.  No.  No yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me.  No.  No.  None of that.  Stop calling them pirates.  They're animals.  We're going to go to the FU line.  When we get back.  FU.  Landlord peeped on female tenants for 20 years. 
[01:07:30]  We'll get to that story finally after the break.  We got Larry Charles, the director of Religious.  20 years?  Coming in at 8 o'clock.  How do you get away with that for 20 years?  It's quite the watching somebody grow up kind of a thing, isn't it?  Got lazy, I guess, at the end.  Yeah.  How did he get caught?  That's what we're going to find out.  How the hell do you look for 20 years on different tenants?  20 years.  And also, a heads up, if you go to onaradio.com, CokeLogic's latest animation is up there.  Oh, what is it? 
[01:08:00]  Hoagie Boy.  All right.  I got to say it.  We got a Hoagie Boy animation from CokeLogic up at onaradio.com.  But first, it doesn't mock Eric, I hope.  Let's go to the FU line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have eight new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, I'd just like to give a big f*** you to my boss, Tom, for making me work a double.  And then after that, try to make me go to his house and pick up a dead f***ing possum. 
[01:08:30]  F*** you.  You were more fun when you were fat.  I hate you.  Next message.  Yeah, I got a couple people I want to say f*** you, too.  My boss.  He's a miserable f***er.  Second, my girl.  F*** you.  You dirty whore.  And third, f*** everybody else who doesn't like me.  Next message.  I want to send a big f*** you to Budweiser beer.  It's all your fault I can remember last night and got a fat chick in my bed.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big f*** you out to Lance. 
[01:09:00]  This guy is such a d*** bag.  Always has to sit around and get high and f*** chicks with herpes.  I mean, really.  You think you're that clever, man?  You're not.  I just give up on you, man.  Sorry.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Knox from Bayonne.  I'm giving a big f*** you to my babysitter's boyfriend, Gabe, for taking her s*** in my bathroom and letting it flood out.  F*** didn't like you to begin with.  Now I hate you.  F*** you.  Next message. 
[01:09:30]  Hey, I'd like to give a big f*** you to me.  Hey, didn't want to stick it out in law school, huh, a-hole?  Hey, congratulations.  Now you're 35 selling cars for a living.  F*** you.  Next message.  Hey, this is Rocco from Wall Street.  I want to give a big f*** you to the Dow, the NASDAQ, and the S&P 500 for making my week the worst week of my career.  My life is also giving me a heart attack.  F*** you, market.  Next message.  I'd like to say f*** you to my girlfriend who went to f*** Australia. 
[01:10:00]  F*** six other guys.  Listen, you.  I was f***ing your sister while you were gone.  Bye.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  F*** you to the max, too.  Goodbye.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got Larry Charles coming in.  Religulous.  Bill Maher's latest movie that Larry Charles directed. 
[01:10:30]  He, of course, directed Borat.  And what did he do for Seinfeld?  A little show called Seinfeld.  A writer.  Of course.  Was he the head writer?  No, I think it was Larry David.  I think Larry David.  I know, but was he, like, you know what I mean?  On probably a couple episodes.  We'll ask him.  All right.  We'll choose him.  Yeah.  Is he using that in his IMDb and he, like, maybe wrote one line?  One of those guys. 
[01:11:00]  Comedians are writing for Leno, but they just send a few jokes in and one got used.  Yeah, then they use a writing credit.  You know, people use our show that way.  I'll look at people's, like, credits.  As heard on?  As heard on the Opie and Anthony show.  Like, that guy was on once and he bombed miserably.  Was he ever on?  He was, but he was never asked back.  But he's using us in his bio.  877-212-0&A.  We got a landlord peeping on tenants for 20 years. 
[01:11:30]  How'd he get caught?  I think the initial thing, like, 20 years ago, technology wasn't as good as it is now for peeping.  That's what I was going to go with.  If you're going to get caught, you should have got caught 20 years ago when all the equipment is, like, bigger than...  Giant.  Giant.  Behind a wall like the Wizard of Oz.  Right.  Meanwhile, now you need a pinhole camera.  I bet he got greedy.  I bet he was so used to not getting caught.  Oldman was doing something and he went, could you move to the left a little?  Something stupid. 
[01:12:00]  He should have got caught because...  Through the wall or something.  The camera spinning film.  Pretty much get a camera on the tip of a pen these days.  How are you getting caught?  This is the story.  You can clearly see one camera out in the open on the front porch of 566 Stanbridge Street.  But it's the other cameras, hidden inside the apartment units here, that landed the landlord, Thomas Daly, behind bars.  He's always been a good landlord.  This male tenant lives on the top floor of the only one of four units here. 
[01:12:30]  Police say was not monitored by hidden security cameras and illegally evading the privacy of young women in the building's three other apartments.  Do you have cameras in your place?  Not to my knowledge.  Oh, not to my knowledge.  But Daly owns 15 other apartments in Norristown.  And the Montgomery County DA says he admitted to spying on female tenants for the past two decades.  Kind of hot.  Hmm.  Kind of hot.  Well, it always is. 
[01:13:00]  Extremely illegal.  Voyeurism.  Kind of hot.  Do you know the lawsuits he's going to have to deal with and he'll have to sell his buildings and just pay these chicks?  Yeah.  He's in deep doo-doo.  He's in big, big trouble.  He might have to file for bankruptcy.  Maybe.  There is just something hot about that, though.  You're right.  There's something incredibly hot about voyeurism.  About just kind of, you know, these friggin' porn movies that are all staged and this and that and the other. 
[01:13:30]  Nothing beats a good, she has no clue she's being watched.  I think a lot of them have a clue, though.  Like this broad across the way.  Maybe stuff like that, but when you've got some guy stashing a camera and you're just home.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, that is, I'm talking about the ones where you walk the neighborhood and all of a sudden, like, all the lights are on in the bedroom and there's not a hint of a curtain and there she is completely naked. 
[01:14:00]  She obviously is into doing that.  Can I tell you a woman that we know from the show?  I won't say her name until I get the okay from her, but she had a, she lived with her boyfriend's family.  And he, the father, the boyfriend's father, she said would come down.  She caught him peeking in the window a couple times.  And he would come in and rifle through the underpants and stuff like that.  And I think they caught him on video, like, looking through her underwear drawer or something.  Just a real creep.  Thank God there was no, like, surveillance when I was, you know, working. 
[01:14:30]  So I would peep and look, locker rooms, things like that.  Whenever I had a job where there were naked women, my prime directive was not getting the job done.  It was figuring out how to see one of these women naked.  And that was it.  I would spend days with tools and stuff and going through ceiling tiles and duct work just to catch a peek.  It was so exciting.  I saw.  Breathing all heavy.  Oh, my God, this is so effing hot. 
[01:15:00]  Holy Jesus Christ.  I saw my sister's friends naked.  Oh, yeah.  I used to do that old gag.  My dad, he was brilliant.  We had a bathroom with a normal-sized window, like the window that we could look at traps.  That's not normal size.  You had a bay window in your bathroom.  Brilliant.  Because my dad's logic, you know, this bathroom, like, faced the woods.  And then you could be taking a bath or a shower, and you could be enjoying the woods. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, I got you.  But somebody in the woods could be enjoying it.  Oh, boy.  Did I figure that one out at an early age?  Also, my mom would be like, Greg, it's 11 o'clock at night.  Why are you going outside?  I would come up with some dumb excuse and run up into the woods, sit kind of next to a tree, and watch my sister's friends shower when they have sleepovers.  Wow.  I used to peep in my sister's window when she had friends over.  Yeah.  And they would change.  Like, oh, they're having a sleepover or something, and they'd change. 
[01:16:00]  I would be outside.  And my outside window, or her outside bedroom window, was like at the front of the house, and there was no cover.  There was no nothing.  So there I am, just like, you know, okay, I'll watch that friend get changed, or something like that.  And then when she used to have the friends over for sleepovers, that's when I used to make them do the headstand competition.  I'd talked about this before.  Well, they needed entertainment, and I was always the funny guy. 
[01:16:30]  So I'd come in and be like, all right, hey, let's have a headstand contest.  And they were all wearing little nightgown type things.  So they would have a headstand contest to see who could stay doing a headstand the longest.  And they would get in a headstand against the wall, because I would say, use the wall.  That's easier that way, knowing that they could do a headstand longer that way.  And their nightgown would flop right over their face, and I would see panties.  Innocently.  So innocently, dude.  Innocently, it would just, like, you know, whoops. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, it was a little whoopsie.  It would flop over, and they would just leave it like that.  Yeah.  It was great.  You know what's funny about your headstand competition?  We used to do that back in the day up there in Boston.  Yes.  On the rock bus.  It definitely got used later on in life.  I was with Anthony once on this rock bus, and he goes, I'll handle this.  And we got, what, two young girls on the rock bus.  And Anthony all of a sudden decides to get them to do a headstand competition. 
[01:17:30]  I'm like, this ain't going to work.  He goes, just watch.  Watch this.  And it worked, boy.  Like a charm, the headstand.  And then we're both sitting there like, why are we faithful?  Why are we faithful to our broads?  I don't know.  Why were we faithful?  Shouldn't have been.  Shouldn't have been.  Weren't for long.  No.  It was awful.  No, we were very, very, very good boys.  But that sneak a peek thing is just, uh...  It's really hot.  It's the best.  Wonderful. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Little nighties.  Here's the second half of the, uh, the landlord story.  A 45-year-old landlord allegedly installed cameras and microphones in the bedrooms behind  ceiling fans, bathrooms behind mirrors, and in living rooms.  Then, from his Phoenixville home miles away, Daley could view the footage here at his house  on the internet.  Wow.  For voyeuristic purposes.  When you hear that he might have been videotaping the females, I couldn't believe it.  Norristown police were first called here when a female tenant found in her apartment  a camera with wires leading to a basement recording system. 
[01:18:30]  Daley was arrested and charged with illegal wiretapping and invasion of privacy.  I wonder which camera she found.  Like, did the mirror break and she saw it, or did the ceiling fan...  That's dumb news.  They don't explain anything.  I know.  These are the little details you want.  How did the guy get caught?  So we could learn.  I mean, so we, uh...  We have to learn from his mistakes.  Hey, I knew this was going to come up, and I got...  I got to address this.  Uh, Opie, you're a liar.  You watched your sister shower. 
[01:19:00]  I, I, I got to tell you, no.  No?  The, the, the day she went into that bathroom, that was too creepy for me.  Even as a kid that was, you know, had raging hormones.  I saw my sister, uh, naked.  In the, you know...  On purpose, though?  That's what...  Well, her friend...  This guy's getting...  Sometimes her friend was in the room.  You know.  At the same time, so...  So your eyes...  You're going to take the hit.  You're like, what do I do?  Two eyes to the left, eyes to the right.  I don't know what to do here.  Left to the...  Oh, no.  Ah, that would... 
[01:19:30]  I hope, I hope she got down her shaving skills a little better.  Your sister.  I'm kidding, Dorney.  Dorney knows I love her.  Oh, my God.  That was way back when.  If you know anything about my upbringing, there were so many freaking people coming and going  in my house.  I had many, many, you know, choices.  Yeah.  Well, I would actually get bummed when I, you know, my sister was going in there.  I'm like, ah.  Come on.  Come on.  Because I also knew that I could only, like, sneak out of the house, like, once without 
[01:20:00]  my mom...  Yeah, saying, what are you doing?  Right.  Because as a kid, there's no excuse to be outside your house at 11, 12 o'clock at night,  whatever the time would be.  Unless you're peeping.  Yeah, exactly.  You want to peep.  You got to peep.  I think every guy has peeped at some point on somebody.  One time I ran out into the woods.  I'm like, Dad, what are you doing?  Yeah.  Hey, what?  You got to watch the open windows. 
[01:20:30]  See it all the time.  Especially here in the city.  It's like that girl that crossed the way.  Like, you just don't...  I don't think you think about it.  If you're just in your house...  Like, for the longest time, I didn't have blinds on my bathroom windows.  Like, my master bathroom window, which is...  It's a giant window that overlooked my neighbor's house in the back.  And then finally got, you know, blinds on there.  But at the time, I didn't give a crap.  Just flopping out.  In New York, people just don't believe in that.  I mean, they'll do a shade every once in a while just to keep the sun out. 
[01:21:00]  But there's no blinds.  No, people...  I think people really like being naked in front of others.  I'll tell you what it is.  I really do.  You don't think...  Because you know my apartment, how it's like...  It's wraparound.  It's a lot of glass.  And in my kitchen, I have a big window.  Yes, you do.  And you can see a bunch of other apartments.  Yeah.  And I literally...  When I walk out of my bathroom naked, my kitchen is straight ahead.  And there's a giant window.  And there's probably 15 to 20 apartments that can very closely look into mine.  I don't care.  You just don't care. 
[01:21:30]  You just almost think, like, whoever looks, big deal.  Yeah.  They're not looking.  You wouldn't just go anywhere else and expose yourself like that.  But there's some safety that you're in your house.  There's a window.  But who cares?  You're naked.  You're flapping all over the place.  Who cares?  But you wouldn't step out your door into the hallway like that.  Do you know how many times, because of the windows where my computer is, how many times  I've had to...  I'm under the desk, and I'm like, I know somebody can see what I'm doing. 
[01:22:00]  And it doesn't turn me on.  I'm just too lazy to get up.  That would be so funny if somebody just sent pictures.  Hey, Jim, check it out.  This is you.  I believe you don't think I haven't closed the shade when certain guests come over.  Hi, Daddy.  All right, hold on.  I've got to do something.  I've got to get this place airtight.  I do have shades, and that's why I got them.  Well, yeah, someone's got a bad back at one in the morning all the time, needs a massage.  When I first moved back to New York, they put me up in, like, this hotel that overlooked 
[01:22:30]  an apartment complex, and I've told the stories over the years.  You know, old lady with the one-piece bathing suits, you know, stirring the sauce.  It's one of those stories we tell from time to time.  But the one thing I want to say today is, like, my window faced this entire apartment  complex, and of course, you know, I had binoculars, and I was checking things out.  And what I saw over and over again were people with telescopes.  Yeah.  Not every other apartment.  That would be an exaggeration, but there was a lot. 
[01:23:00]  And no one's into astronomy.  Astronomy stinks.  But obviously, these people are, like, in New York.  They know they could check out a lot of windows and see what's going on.  Mm-hmm.  Ashley knows how this guy got caught.  Ashley.  Yes.  Hi.  Hey.  Hello.  How do you have?  What's up?  Hi, Ashley.  Hi.  How are you boys today?  Good.  Pretty good, Ashley.  I just want to let you guys know about that peeping Tom, how he got caught.  Yeah.  The girl that called the cops, her boyfriend was changing a light bulb in the bathroom 
[01:23:30]  and found, I don't know whether it was a camera or a microphone or something.  Oh, the old boyfriend changing the light bulb thing.  You'd have to, as a boyfriend, you'd have to go over there and just beat the crap out of  the guy, though, first, and then say, hey, he's got cameras in there.  Yeah, I don't think that's going to the authorities.  That's going right to where he is.  Yeah.  And beating the crap out of him.  Beat him up.  Yeah.  If that was me, my boyfriend better be going over there and beating the crap out of him.  Right. 
[01:24:00]  Exactly.  Cigars and Scotch says he was using the clock from Scarface.  With the big 12 missing, with the big hole in it.  That was $1,500, and there's a giant hole.  Yeah.  How did they not see that?  It's hole o'clock.  No.  How do you not notice in Scarface?  No.  They didn't think anyone would wonder what time it was at any point during that counting  a few million dollars.  What time is it?  It's 11, 12, void one.  But the 12 was out. 
[01:24:30]  Why'd you say 12?  I know, because I'm no improv-ing.  That's where all my improv skills were.  They fell through the hole in the clock.  As I said it, I realized I'm a nothing.  Well, 11, 12, void one.  Exactly.  12, 30 is the void one.  The void is where the humor should have been.  I stepped into it and plummeted to empty silence.  Let's say hi to John in Queens.  John used to check out a girl showering.  Good morning, boys.  How are you, John?  I'm a paramedic out in Queens. 
[01:25:00]  Are you?  Ah, yes, ah, yes, Jimmy.  They used to be this apartment building on the fifth floor every night.  This chick would leave her windows open, and you'd have like four ambulances and two  cop cars out there watching the shower.  It was a great show.  One of the other guys used to carry night vision goggles with them.  So we used to drive around the parks, and we used to watch the little teenagers getting  it on in the cars and stuff, too.  I was always into outdoor action. 
[01:25:30]  Really?  Like, there's something about having sex outside that is really kind of nice.  Cool.  And I don't think it's the...  I've never been one of those, oh, it's if you get caught, that whole thing.  Because that's just an utter distraction.  To me, that's a complete distraction.  The idea of maybe getting caught.  But just being outside, pull the car into the woods and just like up against a tree or something.  It's nice to like, you know, feel a breeze on your... 
[01:26:00]  Ah, yeah, nice little breeze tickling the undercarriage.  Yeah.  I never have been a fan of like underpants and panties and stuff, but I remember when  I was a kid growing up, my neighbors, both really hot girls, and they were older than  me.  I was maybe 12, 13, 15, 16.  And I took a pair of silk panties off the line.  They were clean, though.  They'd probably been hung dry.  Aw.  I kept them for years.  I can't...  I would just reach...  I'd have them in this secret little place.  It was so nice to be so innocent.  And you would use them? 
[01:26:30]  Oh, I would wrap them around myself.  Yeah.  Wow.  Boy, were they fantastic.  They were fantastic.  Wow, that's like a...  That's...  What a coup.  You got something great.  They were so hot.  I forgot how much mileage I got out of those.  I would smell them.  Even though they had been on the line, there was nothing to them.  We did the bit where it was the weirdest thing that when you were a kid, because you  didn't have access to what we have access to now.  Yeah, just...  Like naked women.  Any type of hardcore porno you want to see, it's available. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  I told the story where I stole the tampon from the golf bag, and then I worshipped...  What?  I told that story.  I don't remember this.  I've heard...  I did remember this.  You worshipped a tampon?  I don't know.  I don't...  It was just...  Because it was so, like, taboo.  Yeah, well, you knew where an 11-year-old would have been going.  And it was like...  If you didn't steal it, where it would have been.  Yeah.  I'm saying 11.  I was probably like 12 or 13.  Late developer here, boys and girls.  But I was caddying for a mother-daughter team, and went into the daughter's golf bag after 
[01:27:30]  after the round, and found this thing.  Went, oh, I think I know where this goes.  And I actually brought it home, and I had it in the woods.  You serial killer.  But then I didn't know...  Taking trophies.  But then I didn't know...  Like, I don't know.  But then I...  You should get something they've already used, though.  Any object they've already used, because I hadn't been used yet.  Used tampon?  Not necessarily.  What's wrong with you? 
[01:28:00]  Well, I wouldn't take a...  I think because it was just so taboo that it was a turn-on, but there was not...  It's a tampon.  Who cares?  Yeah.  But it's...  But for a 12 or 13-year-old, just having, like, something that was associated with a  female was kind of a turn-on.  It was...  I don't know.  I can't really explain it, I guess.  All it meant was she was cranky.  I'll tell you one thing.  If you're going to have work done over your house, pull down every picture of your daughter  if she's hot.  Because when I would do a job and I'd go into a house and see pictures like that, I'd go 
[01:28:30]  right into the room and just, like, look for panties on the floor.  Stuff like that.  Do you ever get any good ones?  Just go, oh, that's a good one.  And I would look inside and see, ooh, look at that little stuff going on there.  It was just the hottest thing.  Because you had a visual with the picture, so you knew what she looked like.  And then you're looking at the panty, just going, like, oh, my God.  See?  So dirty.  I haven't brought my whole tampon thing together. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, no.  What did you do?  No, no.  I didn't, like, sit there and, like, take care of myself with, you know, looking at the  tampon.  Nothing like that.  That'd be hysterical, just resting it on your dresser.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, look at that.  The applique you put in your ear.  It was just that it was, like, some...  The tip is so beveled.  It was not...  It was just...  It was taboo.  And I can't really explain it, I guess.  It's because it is.  It's a private thing.  You know what it's used for, where it goes. 
[01:29:30]  Right.  So that's kind of a turn-on.  It is, especially as a younger boy, as a little lad.  Let's go to Chris in New York.  Chris.  How's it going, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Chris.  Dude, wasn't it the little sketch?  It was like a drawing of a woman with one foot up on the toilet bowl? 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, and that was how she would use it.  Well, we've talked about this, too.  That was hardcore porn for an 11- or 12-year-old.  Yeah.  For that, it was like, oh, man, look at this.  Yeah.  Right on, man.  All right, let's go to Adam on Long Island before we take a break.  Adam.  Yo, guys.  What's good?  Hey, man.  Hey, Adam.  I got two different scenarios.  The first one was when I was in college, we had an apartment that faced across the street  a sorority house.  So every Friday and Saturday, the girl would come home from the bar, tanked, and she would 
[01:30:30]  bang out a different guy every time, right in the window, didn't care.  It's Bluto Blutarski we're talking to here.  With a ladder up against the window.  Why did you ever move?  The semester at the end.  I had no choice.  I mean, oh, okay.  Spent 10 years in college.  Yeah.  I was thinking, like, no, you were just a regular guy.  You just happened to live in a college town across the street from a sorority house.  Why would you ever leave?  Yeah.  I'm not back. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  It was fantastic.  Cool.  Thanks, Adam.  Your phone's a little choppy.  But I got to get Brett, the owner of FH Riley.  He's in the heart of Huntington Village.  Yeah, 400 New York Avenue.  He tells a great story about how he was checking out this girl every freaking morning.  I think that we told him where he set his alarm clock to be on her.  Setting your alarm to wake up so you could peep.  No, he would set his alarm clock to be on her schedule because she was getting up at, like, 530 or something like that. 
[01:31:30]  Window, no shades, old school window, one of those older houses in Huntington.  And I stayed at his apartment many times.  I mean, his window was literally 20, 30 feet from this bathroom window, and the girl would just do everything naked.  And he would set his alarm clock, and he would get snacks.  How do you eat when that's happening?  Movie.  He was enjoying the hell out of himself.  He would set up his snacks right on the windowsill and just check out this girl every morning.  Yeah, you'd have to... 
[01:32:00]  Chicken wings, like, from the night before.  He didn't care.  What a creep.  How do you eat a snack?  Eating?  You should be scrapping.  Yeah, it's hard to scrap during.  I'm sure he probably did, but he's not going to tell his older brother.  Very hard to scrap during the peep.  No.  It's very hard.  You've got to put it in your memory because there's too many distractions and things like that.  So you kind of put it in your spank Rolodex.  Yeah, he was bummed when he had to, like, leave that apartment.  That's for sure.  We used to go in the apartments in North Brunswick and peek through windows and stuff like that.  And there was one girl in Little Leopard Panties who we used to always see sleeping man. 
[01:32:30]  I couldn't scrap because my friends were there, but I went back by myself and tried to.  What is Danny writing?  New York City subway is great for peeping?  Certain staircases and escalators?  Yeah, absolutely.  If you're down below and they're walking up the stairs, you get a hell of a view.  Oh, I mean, I could think of two subway stops just off the top of my head immediately that are perfect for, like, upskirts and stuff like that.  One is Queensborough Plaza.  By the preschool?  There's like a mesh.  It's kind of like the Brady stairs where there was kind of, you know, but there was like a mesh, and you could just see right through it. 
[01:33:00]  So if you're waiting for the train in the correct spot, you could just every so often just kind of take a nice little peek.  Showtime.  I love how Danny makes believe I just happened.  You're going under the stairs.  You just happened to be under the stairs.  With 200 other guys.  Cameras, phone cameras.  The rest of the platform, not a person to be seen.  You missed our train three times.  Right.  It's completely a local reference, but there's a 7 train here in New York, and the 74th and Broadway stop has one of the largest escalators I've ever seen in my entire life. 
[01:33:30]  It just goes up forever.  And, you know, with a chick wearing a – it doesn't even have to be a very short skirt.  Proper angle, yeah.  If you get on the bottom of that escalator when she's at the almost, you know, like a quarter of the way – you're seeing everything.  I'm sure there's a formula to dictate the triangle of the escalator and the distance away from the length of the skirt and where the actual –  And you know the creeps are at the bottom of the escalator like, not yet, not yet, I think.  There it is.  Right.  No way. 
[01:34:00]  Some mathematicians going, she's going to have to be in an elevation of 39 feet.  And go now!  Get on the escalator.  Even, you know, even on the subway cars, if you, you know, like in busy –  If you lay on the floor, right.  With your face up.  No, I mean, sometimes these chicks, they wear like ridiculous – even on, like, commuting to work or they're going to the club on a Friday, Saturday night.  They wear ridiculous clothes where if you're sitting directly across from some of these chicks, like you could pretty much see everything going on.  When Danny wrote New York City Subway is great for peeping, I'm picturing he's the guy, like, exposing himself. 
[01:34:30]  There's, like, women taking pictures of Danny with their camera phone and sending it to the police department.  Is Larry Charles here?  Not yet?  Okay.  We're going to talk to Larry Charles hopefully after the break.  Very, very confident – controversial, sorry, movie coming out with Bill Maher.  Is it a comedy or is it more about serious?  A lot of jokes, Jimmy.  Okay.  But also getting some knowledge out there or his take on the whole organized religion thing.  I'm so pissed off I didn't see it.  I have to see it this morning.  I think you would enjoy the film.  Yeah, I think so, too. 
[01:35:00]  Hey, we're going to do a little primetime gossip as we go to break here with Sam Roberts.  We're back with more primetime gossip.  When we last left you, the Anthelini empire was crumbling around us, and since then things have gone from bad to hilarious  as Anthony revealed the true reason Anthelini came to an end.  She takes these goddamn pills that keep the fat from digesting.  It goes right through you.  And then she goes to bed, and a certain part of her body will leak. 
[01:35:30]  Anthony decided to continue his streak, no pun intended, of descriptiveness and honesty,  just in case the listeners at home couldn't pick up on exactly what he was talking about.  I woke up one morning, and I swear it looked like someone overturned a pizza on my sheets.  The big announcement left Anthony's co-workers in utter shock.  Jimmy's hand is over his mouth. 
[01:36:00]  His eyes are as wide as I've ever seen them before.  Well, because he just saw the traffic.  There's an oil spill on the LIE today.  Oh, Jesus.  An oil slick?  Yeah.  What must have happened?  And we have listeners that are trying to take the LIE.  There's an oil spill in my bed.  The pillow skidded off.  But even after all this, the pure sweetness that is Anthelini shone through as the pet names continued.  Oh, they're calling her Jill Nicolicki.  Oh, boy.  There it is.  Could it possibly get any worse? 
[01:36:30]  Keep listening as PTG follows a situation that could only end in a felony.  Stay tuned.  Oh, my God.  I had to walk away.  Oh, Jesus.  I had to walk away.  How do we explain this?  How do we explain this?  How about this?  A new rule on the L.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Sam has to be in here with his camera at all times.  Yeah.  And Steve is not allowed to wear a hat.  Yeah.  I just don't know. 
[01:37:00]  Steve, do you go home and then go, I'm not being goofed on enough and decide to do things?  Well, no, you know what?  I don't do things with the explicit intent of being goofed on.  I just really don't care at this point.  All right.  Please take the hat off.  Come on.  We have to goof on your hair.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't even.  But we got to explain.  Steve comes in today and he's got a hat on backwards.  And it's obvious that, well, it was obvious that he had a shaved head.  Yeah. 
[01:37:30]  Out of nowhere, he decided to shave his head down to like just skin.  So we've been asking him to take the hat off all morning so we could see the shaved head.  And to our surprise, it's not a shaved head.  No.  When he has the hat on backwards, it looks shaved because what's exposed is skin, right?  Way above his ears, right?  Yeah.  Easily an inch to two inches above his ears are completely shaved.  So we finally decided to take the hat off.  And you want to take the hat off again there, Steve? 
[01:38:00]  He's got.  Isn't that great?  He's got what amounts to.  Here, look this way.  The George McFly.  Well, I'm flicking it back.  There it is.  Wait.  Take the headphones off.  Stories.  And look toward Anthony.  Science fiction stories.  Take the headphones off.  You said no.  Now turn that way.  Oh, my God.  I was going to go totally bald.  You should have.  Eh, I might. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, George, what are you working on?  Websites.  Science fiction.  Forno.  Can you explain what you're doing?  So basically, when he takes the hat off, obviously, he has a lot of hair still.  On top.  Yeah, it's growing.  I've got the long.  It's growing out on top.  And systematically, I've been growing it longer on top, but having it trimmed on the sides.  Now I just went bald on the sides.  Completely bald on the sides.  Are you going crazy? 
[01:39:00]  Maybe.  Yeah.  You're joining Devo.  Devo had hair like this?  Also, Shemp Howard had that, too.  Shemp.  Yeah, I was doing Moe.  Demolition, man.  I was doing Moe Howard in the shower the other day.  Yeah, Moe had it, but he had the bangs.  Shemp brushed it back.  Let's throw One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in there, too.  There was a few of those type of haircuts, right?  What's his name?  Billy.  Billy, right.  Billy.  He's stuttering and stabbing.  Billy Bivitt.  Yeah.  Billy Bivitt.  Yeah, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  There you go.  Brad Dourif. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  He was in Exorcist III.  And Mississippi Burning Man.  He's been in a lot of stuff.  He was in Lord of the Rings.  Don't try to divert the conversation.  I'm not trying to divert the conversation.  I'm just trying.  Someone wants to elaborate how you were doing Moe in the shower.  I meant to say behaving like one.  I meant to say combing my hair forward like Moe.  Of course.  Stump Brain, I'm sending you these pictures immediately.  Okay.  It's, uh, wow.  It's actually very cool.  God damn it.  That's a good one, too.  Forrest Gump.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:40:00]  Got a little Forrest Gump thing going there.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Well, Steve is just down the show with that one.  We have to bring our, uh, is he right outside the door?  Yeah, let's get Larry Charles, the director from Religious.  Religious.  Ken in Delaware, as we get Larry situated.  What's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey, Ken.  Hey, uh, oh, do a favor, man.  Yeah.  Please do not root for the Phillies.  Yeah, you know what?  Your in-laws and everybody else around this area.  Philadelphia is.  Root for the Brewers and the Dodgers. 
[01:40:30]  You know what, though?  Philadelphia is becoming my second home.  I'm down there all the time.  I'm going to be down there again this weekend.  And I really like this Phillies team.  I was telling that in the office, you know, now that the Mets are out, I'm all in.  Phillies.  Phillies finally win the World Series.  Again.  Or for the first time.  No, again, right?  They've won it, but it's been a long time.  A long time.  Is it 81 or something like that?  One division.  All right, so you just barrel through.  You just barrel through.  Why would I root for the Brewers?  I have no attachment to Milwaukee.  Exactly.  He's, um...  I don't know, man.  Just root for somebody else. 
[01:41:00]  Uh, Phillies all the way.  It's very obvious.  Come on.  Come on, man.  You're killing us.  First do it.  All right, man.  Uh, where's Larry Charles?  He doesn't want to come in now?  I think he's at the other dressing room.  Since that stupid CBS move in our dressing room is on 54th Street.  I know.  Why couldn't they put CBS in that?  Because they're dummies.  Please.  No one thinks.  All right, well, uh...  No one thinks.  Larry, look at you.  Hey.  Hey, there you go.  Larry, you're all dressed up. 
[01:41:30]  You're doing TV later?  Yes, I am.  Not in the suit, though, amazingly enough.  Should I take this off and do that?  No, I don't care.  All right.  You look good, man.  What do you need?  Tell me what you need.  Usually people, like, you know, come in here in sweats and T-shirts.  Yeah.  You look good.  I saw Religious.  Thank you.  Religious, is that...  Religious is correct.  Okay.  Starring Bill Maher, of course, as a documentary.  And Larry Charles did Borat.  Yes, sir.  And Bill Maher decided that you were the perfect person for this project.  Apparently so.  Do you want to, like, give the explanation of the movie before we start? 
[01:42:00]  It's about religion.  Obviously, yeah.  It's...  It's...  That's okay.  My head's getting smaller, I think.  I've been shrinking lately.  It is...  The premise of the movie...  First of all, the premise, the thesis behind the movie is to make a Saturday night date  movie about religion.  I want people on a Saturday night to open the paper.  They're looking for a movie.  They see Dark Knight.  They see Tropic Thunder.  Then they see Religious.  They go, okay, this looks like it might be a good time.  I want people to have a good time.  I want it to be a rollicking, rock and roll, rollercoaster ride through religion. 
[01:42:30]  That's kind of a tough order.  Yeah, it is.  But it seemed, like, worth doing, though.  Yeah.  And surprisingly, both of us realized that no one had really done that before.  I mean, other than the life of Brian, it's hard to find a movie that's kind of a scathing  satire of religion.  None's on the run, my friend.  Yeah, none's on the run.  That's right.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  I got laid after Passion of the Christ.  There you go.  There you go.  Exactly.  Sister act.  This is like the Passion of the Antichrist, basically.  So, Bill wanted to do a thing kind of skewering religion. 
[01:43:00]  I haven't seen it.  I didn't realize the screening.  It was a bunch of, did he interview a bunch of people, or what exactly did he do?  Yeah, he pretty much went around the world interviewing people.  Yeah, we went all around the world interviewing people, but that's one layer of the movie.  Then, you know, in the editing process, we use a lot of archival clips.  We're using great music.  The movie opens with The Seeker by The Who.  So, there's a great soundtrack, great archival clips of Hollywood movies that are, you know,  the absurd Jeffrey Hunter, blue-eyed, blonde-haired Jesuses, and stuff like that. 
[01:43:30]  And so, it's a real fast-paced mix of a lot of layers of information.  Yeah, Bill Maher's making some, you know, pretty solid points about organized religion.  Then, they'll go to a quick clip from some old-school Jesus movie.  And that was brilliant, man.  Some of those clips, just out loud funny.  We were howling at the screening.  I don't want to give it away, but there was a few that are going to make people really laugh hard.  Yeah, I hope so.  I mean, you know, again, what's great about making a documentary is that you can get those clips for nothing under the fair use law. 
[01:44:00]  If you can make it clear that there's some meaning to the clips that's illuminating the point that you're making,  they give you the clips for free.  So, we were able to, on a very low-budget movie, able to use a lot of that kind of stuff.  You know, it was great.  Now, what about Backlash?  Anything?  You know, how some people, like, when Dogma came out.  Oh, Dogma!  Dogma!  When Dogma came out, I know Kevin Smith got a lot of crap from the Catholic League.  Yeah, I think this is an equal opportunity offender.  With religion, sometimes that doesn't matter. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, it may not.  It may not.  I mean, people haven't seen it yet.  Obviously, it hasn't come out yet.  So, the Backlash hasn't begun.  But again, for me, the biggest controversy would not be, like, protesters in front of the theater or anything like that.  It would be people who would normally be aghast and offended by this movie to go in again on a Saturday night at the mall and go and see it and find themselves laughing despite themselves.  That, to me, would be the greatest triumph and the greatest controversy.  So, what do you do?  You just present it as ridiculously as it's presented by the people that try to pump this stuff.  And it's just, it's funny. 
[01:45:00]  You don't have to do very much.  Yeah, you really don't.  You don't have to say, what do you believe?  And once people start talking about the talking snake or the Garden of Eden or the big whale or those stories, and you realize they're, like, children's stories that we as adults cling to on some kind of literal level, that's kind of scary.  As basing your whole existence on a children's story kind of a thing.  That's correct.  It's like believing that Santa Claus, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Only you're told at 10 years old that Santa Claus isn't real.  You're not told at 10 that Jesus isn't real.  So, you cling to it for many, many years afterwards.  And, of course, it leads, the point of the movie is it's leading to the, these children's stories are leading to the end of the world. 
[01:45:30]  That's the ending of all the children's stories.  And, you know, the Bible, the Koran, the New Testament, they all have apocalypse scenarios.  So, these kind of silly stories are taking us to the end of the world, which is kind of, that's the most religious thing of all.  Yeah, believing that someone actually lived inside a whale, you know.  Right.  Well.  You know.  That is a silly little story they put in there.  But people believe it.  Do we have any, any, Bill Donahue?  Anyway, I know he's had quite a few problems with Bill over the years. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, I don't know very much about him.  I know he wants to have a boxing match with Bill.  That's his idea of a solution to the problem.  Well, you're going to hear a lot from Donahue in the coming weeks.  He's going to be spearheading this one.  He'll be on all the news stations.  It'll be good for your movie, though.  Exactly.  They all, you know, people, what happens, and it happened to Borat, too, is that initially people are distressed.  Then the movie comes out.  It's kind of successful.  They bask in the 15 minutes of fame that they get.  They ask for DVDs.  Sasha will sign a DVD and send it off to them, and then they sue you. 
[01:46:30]  So that's the solution.  Great.  Thanks.  You guys do okay with all the lawsuits from Borat?  Amazingly enough, just last week, the last of the lawsuits were dismissed.  We set a precedent in the courts, and hopefully that'll be usable when we start getting sued on.  They came out of the precedent.  The precedent was that we did our homework.  We had very tight legal releases.  We had no liability whatsoever, so the lawsuits were all founded to have no merit whatsoever, so they were all dismissed.  Oh, good for you, man.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah.  You guys went after the Mormons. 
[01:47:00]  Yes.  And Joseph Smith.  Yeah.  A real scam artist.  But the people are believing.  Look at the stuff they've built in the honor of Joseph Smith.  The Mormonism, which is one of the fastest-growing religions, has one of the craziest stories.  You know, I mean, God is a flesh-and-blood man.  He actually had physical intercourse with Mary.  You know, if black people are subhuman in Mormonism, they just recently changed that, by the way.  You know, but in the Book of Mormon, black people are considered to be less than human. 
[01:47:30]  All these things people didn't know.  If Mitt Romney had gotten the nomination, this stuff might have come to the surface.  But it's pretty amazing that there's a growing religion that believes these kind of things,  you know, in this day.  When did Joseph Smith live?  In the 1800s.  1800s.  Okay.  That's when they knew a lot about everything.  Right, right.  Let me tell you that.  And when you die, not only are you facing God, you're also facing Joseph Smith.  Yeah.  So that's good.  That's right.  That's right.  And you get your own planet also. 
[01:48:00]  You get your own planet if you live a good life here on Earth.  Can I ask you what you do with that planet?  Whatever the hell you want.  It's just you on a planet.  Invite your white friends.  Yeah, but you're white friends, yeah.  But is it, can you, but if everyone has their own planet, then you got to invite people over  like, hey, you want to come over to the planet tonight or else you're alone.  But that's exactly the movie.  The movie is asking those questions, those basic questions that are like logical questions  about these things.  How does the planet thing work, you know? 
[01:48:30]  And nobody thinks about that deeply.  They just accept it, you know?  So they're all stunned and shocked when Bill asks these basic, simple questions about their  own belief system, you know?  Yeah.  And then you guys went to the Creation Museum.  I thought that was fantastic.  I would say take the family for sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good one.  And they believe that dinosaurs and the humans walk in the Earth at the same time.  And not only that, I'll give away this one shot.  There was a shot, I think I said it earlier anyway, where a dinosaur had a saddle on it.  Yes.  Basically saying, not only did we live together, we rode dinosaurs like we ride horses. 
[01:49:00]  Exactly.  And people believed this.  And the most insidious part of the Creation Museum is if you walk in there, it's an amazing  place.  It looks just like the Natural History Museum here in New York.  So you think, oh, it's scientific, but it's all this kind of quasi-science.  It's all fake science to justify these incredibly crazy belief systems.  They'll always take science and just throw it aside.  Like, ah, now we got to think.  Because for years, I didn't even hear the explanation that man was around with dinosaurs. 
[01:49:30]  That's a new one.  They just used to say, no, there were no such things as dinosaurs.  I don't know what you're talking about.  They pull up these bones.  We don't know what they are.  Right, exactly.  And then the science of it got so good that people accepted the fact that, yes, there were  dinosaurs.  So they had to address it by going, yeah, well, we were around with the dinosaurs.  It still works into the whole storybook thing.  Well, what's really sick and sad about it is, like, 1925 was the Scopes trial.  You know, Inherit the Wind and all that.  And so we had really finished this discussion, like, 50, 80 years ago already.  You know, that evolution is real and that creationism is a story and all that kind of 
[01:50:00]  stuff.  And yet somehow it has crept back into the point that now they want to teach a creationism  next to evolution in the school system again.  It's like teaching magic with chemistry.  You know what I mean?  It's very scary.  Alchemy will turn lead to gold.  I was pretty well-informed going into seeing this movie.  But the one thing I was not informed about that you educated me on was the fact that  our story of Jesus is a story that was told many, many times way before Jesus lived in 
[01:50:30]  very much older religions.  The story is exactly the same.  And that kind of creeped me out to find that out.  There's a number of things about that.  First of all, yes, there are many, many myths and legends of a Jesus-like figure that predate  Christianity, you know.  That has the same basic story.  He was born on the same, you know, these guys were born on the same day.  They were crucified.  They were resurrected.  They had 12 disciples.  They were shepherds and all these kind of things, all the same stuff. 
[01:51:00]  You know, that's the first thing.  The second thing is, which was shocking to me and I discovered in the making of the movie,  is that there's absolutely zero evidence that Jesus even existed.  There's none.  There's no tangible evidence.  There are many writers writing at the time of Jerusalem in the Roman occupation who were  there, historians who were there, journalists who were there.  There are tons of writing on that stuff, not one mention of Jesus, basically.  The only mention of Jesus is in the Gospels, which those were written long, long after  he supposedly was dead. 
[01:51:30]  Many, many decades, even liberally speaking, it could be as much as 200 years later that  the Gospels were written and they don't even match.  Which is odd because, and you might say, wow, well, it was such a long time ago, but there  are cultures that predate Jesus that we have pretty good information on.  You know, Egyptian, Roman Empire, you know, those things predating Jesus, why is it, you're  right, why isn't there any tangible evidence?  That's right.  Like, we know there was a King Tut.  Exactly.  There's a body, there's a tomb, there's historical documentation. 
[01:52:00]  Right.  So where is Jesus?  And Pontius Pilate existed.  All those other people did exist and they are written about very extensively, but the name  Jesus, this cult leader Jesus has never mentioned in any of those historical accounts.  Did you guys address it all?  I heard someone talk, a scientist, about why people become religious or believe in a deity.  Something about how it's kind of put there, perhaps by nature, as kind of like, because  everyone has natural enemies except for us.  So that's kind of like a stop for us or something for us to kind of, to keep ourselves from going 
[01:52:30]  completely over it.  I also think it's a hope.  You've got to have some kind of hope that you're not just going to die and it ends.  So we're so self-important, we think that we can't just turn into dust, that we have  to become some part of some collective Borg or something that makes us feel better.  It's a gigantic ego problem.  Right.  We're afraid of death.  And in fact, if you look at the history of Christianity, it was really founded as a 
[01:53:00]  slave religion.  Those people had horrible lives and they said, well, look, it's really bad now.  But the next life, it's going to kick ass.  Yeah, yeah.  So just get through this one.  Yes, that's right.  Just do your thing here, but it's going to be great in the next life.  You know, and that's a great promise to people.  You know, that's the perfect invisible product, you know.  And I was mentioning before, was there, I didn't, again, I didn't see it, was, I know  Bill didn't do a whole bunch on Eastern religions, but was there anything addressed  with Islam?  Because I noticed a lot of things just won't address, and it's obviously prevalent what's 
[01:53:30]  going on now.  It was addressed on some level.  Oh, there's a massive section on Islam and the danger, especially in Europe, because what you  see in Europe and places like Amsterdam, which are really cool cities, you know, what's  happening is that they're so tolerant that they've allowed this intolerant, fundamentalist,  Muslim immigration to take place.  Those people are sort of like large population.  The most popular baby name in Europe is Mohammed now.  You know, so things are really changing in Europe and these liberal, progressive cities  that are secular now.  You know, in England and in Netherlands, people don't go to church anymore, but you have this 
[01:54:00]  fundamentalist, Muslim thing happening, and this is creating a clash of cultures also.  And one part of the movie that was hilarious, he found gay Muslims.  Right.  Two of them.  Two.  In Amsterdam?  Thank God there were two.  It was a gay Muslim, wait, a Muslim gay bar.  Yes.  Right?  Yes.  Yes.  And he went there on like a Tuesday night or whatever, there's two guys.  Two guys.  Yeah.  Two gay Muslims.  Rock.  And the other thing...  And they weren't attracted to each other, so that was a big problem.  You guys had some great angles in this movie, and then you... 
[01:54:30]  They're both waiting for the other one to get drunk enough for in the morning.  Right, right.  And then you interviewed two...  Sexual jihads, I think it was.  Two Jewish gentlemen that actually went over to Iran.  Yes.  And what do they believe?  Well, this one rabbi went to the Holocaust denial conference in Iran because he doesn't  believe that Israel should exist.  That's a whole movement in Judaism, an extremist movement in Judaism that doesn't believe that  the Israelis have earned Israel. 
[01:55:00]  They shouldn't have Israel, and so this guy actually kind of hangs out with the president  of Iran and denies the Holocaust and tries to destroy Israel.  That's his thing.  He's a hardcore Jew with the payas and everything, and he's over in Iran supporting what...  Wow, that's very odd.  Yes.  The hell's he thinking?  Like, where does he want the Jews to go?  He believes that the Jews don't deserve the land until they've earned it somehow, and  they haven't been holy enough yet to earn it, and he's waiting for some sign, I guess.  Does he say where they should go, though, or no? 
[01:55:30]  He wants them to hang out in Muncie, upstate here, until they get the word from the Messiah.  The sign is apparently going to be a mushroom cloud launched from Iran.  That's right.  That's a good sign.  That's the one.  Make your move.  That's the one that he wants to see.  Larry, you got time?  Can we take a quick break?  Sure, of course.  All right, Larry Charles, the director of Religious, starring Bill Maher, documentary.  And when we get back, I want to talk about Scientology and maybe take some phone calls,  because, I mean, this is a very sensitive subject, and I'm sure, well, people have a lot to say. 
[01:56:00]  877-212-ON-A.  Stay there.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Larry Charles in studio, the director of Religious, starring Bill Maher.  It's a documentary on organized religion.  And pretty much goes after most religions.  Didn't go after the Eastern religions, because he openly admitted he doesn't know much about those.  Well, that's the whole second movie, though.  Possibly a second movie.  Not the sequel, yeah.  Bravo.  And unfortunately, we had to take a break, because, wow. 
[01:56:30]  The discussion we were having during the break, now we've got to make believe we didn't have it,  because it was...  There's plenty more to talk about.  Well, in the movie, Religious, they go to the Vatican, and outside, they get kicked out of the Vatican, right?  Yes.  Why did they kick you out of the Vatican?  Well, they realized we didn't belong there, and we were kind of trying to film, and we were trying to sort of get, you know,  we were trying to get to the Pope.  We were right down the hall from the Pope's apartment.  And eventually, we had gotten through the Swiss Guard, and we had gotten through all the security, 
[01:57:00]  which was pretty lax, I have to say.  And we wound up on the floor that the Pope lives on, in his apartment there.  And, of course, the Vatican, you know, you saw the priest, he's an old guy, the Pope's an old guy.  It's kind of like a nursing home, in a sense, a religious nursing home.  That's what it's sort of like.  There's a lot of old men walking around.  Well, the old priest, one of the highlights of the movie, outside the Vatican, Vatican's in the background.  Bill Maher, you know, interviews this older priest.  Father Foster.  And he seemed like, well, he was saying some crazy stuff that probably priests shouldn't be saying. 
[01:57:30]  Right.  And I'm thinking, oh, you found some kook.  Not kook, because he was making a lot of sense, to be honest with you.  And then it turns out, because we asked a few questions during the break,  this guy lives right next to the Pope inside the Vatican, and he's believing this stuff.  He's one of the highest level Vatican priests.  But I think what you discover is that the Vatican hierarchy knows all this stuff already.  They're all PhDs.  They're all enlightened people.  They're all highly educated.  They know the difference between the reality and the myths, but they're afraid to sort of disseminate that information to the masses  because there would be anarchy, the church would fall, and the institution itself would collapse. 
[01:58:00]  Right.  Can't they let out little bits at a time to kind of get people used?  Not the fact that we don't know if there's a God, but just little things that were kind of crap.  Can't they do that to make themselves more relevant in modern times?  It's so easy to debunk so much of it now.  Well, that's really a part of a bigger point, which is that originally religion was sort of invented to sort of explain our world to ourselves and what we're doing here.  And actually, ironically, there are major questions to ask about life today, where we're from, where we're going, why we're here. 
[01:58:30]  And those questions are actually thwarted.  The inquiry is thwarted by organized religion.  Yeah, and they can't even, like, admit that the priest or having sex with the little boys.  Initially, the religion was to kind of hold you off so they promised you an answer to all the questions.  That's right.  Like, growing up and being raised Catholic until my early teens, I guess, I was always told, yeah, you'll go to heaven, some heaven place where you get anything you want. 
[01:59:00]  I remember being told this, you get anything you want, anything you could dream of is yours.  Yeah.  And all your questions will be answered.  So all those things that you start growing up and you think, like, the universe has no end?  Well, how does that work?  And, you know, I can't wrap my mind around it.  It'll all be answered in the afterlife with Jesus.  Yeah.  And then you realize, what?  It's got a wacky story.  And where do you get the white robe when you show up to this? 
[01:59:30]  Is it like jail where they give you, like, you know, your little...  Yeah, how does that work?  And your loved ones, like, are they old and dead?  And they have to walk around all hunched over still like they died?  Or do they get young?  Who gets to choose how young you get to be?  Is that God's choice?  Or do you go, I want to be this age again?  And how crowded is this place, by the way?  How many trillions of people have died?  Right.  Where are they?  And then you're supposed to be reunited with loved ones.  Let's say you truly love somebody, you married them, they died, you moved on, married someone 
[02:00:00]  else, truly love them, they die, you die, and now you've got two bitches that you don't  know what to do with because you're in heaven and everyone's supposed to be rejoined again.  I think that's actually hell that you're describing.  That's true.  I want to go back to that priest outside the Vatican.  What were some of the stuff he did say in the movie?  He said that basically the entire Jesus story is just that, a story.  He said that December 25th is absurd.  He said that all the things that we've sort of taken assumption about are false, essentially, 
[02:00:30]  and that's not what Jesus was about at all.  I want to go back to that point because that came from a guy that's living right next to  the Pope in the Vatican, not Larry's angle where he found some kooky priest in the middle  of nowhere.  This guy is pretty much ground zero of the religion.  We've had some criticism that we go after fringe people and extremists, and that's really  not true.  This guy is a high-level priest in the Vatican.  The other priest that we spoke to is also a very high-level Vatican priest.  We spoke to Senator Mark Pryor.  We spoke to Francis Collins, who is one of the most highly esteemed scientists in the 
[02:01:00]  world, who happens to also somehow strangely believe in all this stuff.  So we've talked to him.  We tried to get to the highest echelons of power we could.  Of course, there's a whole phalanx of filters preventing you from getting to the team.  Why would that guy talk to you?  Because you just wrecked his retirement plan.  I don't think he cared.  I think he was at a point where he was kind of liberated.  He's old, and he didn't care anymore.  The truth is more important to him at this point.  So I appreciated that, actually.  And then Ant was discussing Republicans and the... 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, how the Republican Party has just been now aligned with the religious right.  Yeah.  And it's just such an odd thing now, because if you say you're a Republican, people assume  that you're this anti-abortion, just lunatic religious zealot.  Well, and of course abortion, there's no mention of abortion in the Bible at all.  There's no mention of homosexuality or being against it.  Jesus never preaches against homosexuality.  These are all things that were added on later that people sort of glommed onto or made up 
[02:02:00]  to justify their own bad behavior, you know?  Yeah.  What did...  Because they always quote that thing, some page in the Bible or some line about God  saying that man should not lay with man.  Right, right, right.  But there's a lot of man laying with man, actually, in the Bible.  Really?  Sodom and Gomorrah.  Hot.  If you read the story of Noah very carefully, you see that somehow or another Noah's sons  violated him.  You read these things, they're there, you know?  Noah's sons raped Noah, you know, while he was drunk, you know? 
[02:02:30]  And that's...  Wow.  I mean, if we had the Bible here, I'd show you the passage.  It's absolutely true.  Larry, you're going to have a hell of a three months.  You are going to be all over the place.  Yes, sir.  Scientology.  Yeah.  Well, Scientology is just, you know, it's the same thing in a new package, that's all.  It's like a science fiction writer came up with it.  It sounds crazy because it's new, but really, when you compare it to the elements of the  old religions, it's really just as crazy. 
[02:03:00]  Given enough time for the pages to turn brown and curl up a little bit, you have a legitimate  religion that everybody would just go, hey, that's fine, you know?  Judaism, Christianity, Islam, they all start as cults, too, you know?  I mean, they all start as cults, you know?  Some of them make it and some of them don't.  It's a marketing thing.  It's all in the marketing.  Yeah, that's right.  Scientology seems to have a lot of marketing money.  Well, you know, Jesus had, you know, that was the thing.  Judaism was like a punishing God, a judgmental God, and then Christ comes along and he's  like, no, I forgive everybody, turn the other cheek, you know, and all that kind of stuff. 
[02:03:30]  That was a good message.  That's a better product.  It's sold, yeah.  Yeah.  It's sold very well.  It's better than guilt and beating yourself.  Exactly.  Now, you guys travel the world for this movie?  Where was the scariest place?  I would say Jerusalem is most probably the scariest place because right there is the  center of all the conflict from the very beginning, and you sense that at all times.  There's rubble everywhere, ancient rubble.  You know, there's like bullet holes everywhere.  From the same conflict.  From the same conflict, exactly.  And you could, you know, there are soldiers with machine guns.  There are angry Muslims, angry Jews. 
[02:04:00]  Everyone's angry.  And so it's a very volatile place, and you can see the violence ready to erupt at any  moment.  In the holiest of lands.  That's right.  That's right.  It's the exact opposite.  It's such a hypocritical thing that no one really seems to see that more damage has been  done under the flag of religion than anything else on this planet, aside from maybe bitches.  And that leads to Sharon's question.  There are no, you know, excuse me for one second. 
[02:04:30]  That's what I say.  There are no bitches in this scenario either.  This is such a male-dominated world, the world of religion, that there are virtually  no women in positions of power in religion anywhere in the world, which is an interesting  aspect of it, too.  Let's go to Sharon in New York.  Sharon.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  We've got Larry Charles, the director of Allegulous in the studio.  Hi.  This is really interesting.  I don't think I want to go see this.  Don't think.  Yes.  We saw it Friday, a few of us, and yeah, we were laughing out loud, and then we were 
[02:05:00]  getting educated, I think, a little bit, and I enjoyed the film immensely.  Because my question is, what is the whole, you know, idea behind the movie, or what are  you supposed to come away with the movie thinking?  Because I was raised Methodist or Protestant or whatever, and I don't know, I'm struggling  with my own idea of what this thing is supposed to be about.  I just dumped a guy that was atheist because he was trying to talk to me, so I don't know  what to think about all this.  Well, I think if you're a modern human in the world and you look around you, you realize 
[02:05:30]  how much destruction is being done in the name of these silly belief systems.  You know, we're just saying, be rational, ask some questions, you know, and if you can  change the dialogue ever so slightly, shift the paradigm ever so slightly, things might  change eventually.  So this is a commercial for atheism, that's what this movie is?  No, no, not at all.  It's a commercial for reasonableness, you know, that's what it is.  It's against extremism, it's against the violence that will come out of this religion, it's  against destroying the world, that's what it's about. 
[02:06:00]  And enough films have been...  Well, do you believe in any kind of higher power?  What is, you know, is that?  I believe that there's many mysteries in the universe that we can't explain yet, and we're  not allowed to inquire about them, religion stops us from asking those questions.  That's good.  Yeah, you guys definitely make a point that we need to get rid of religion to save the  world.  That's right.  That was a pretty heavy point, by the way.  How could so many people, because I'm reading things here on the phones and feedback and  stuff, I'm just reading, a lot of, you get people angry. 
[02:06:30]  A lot of people get angry when you step on their religion.  Yes.  And I don't understand how they can't just open their mind for a second and listen to  reason, where this is, it says it right in the bill of sale, it's faith-based.  Yes.  Completely faith-based.  Yes.  There's no real hard evidence.  And then you show them something with hard evidence, and they'll try to debunk it based  on just their faith-based stuff.  Well, you know, it's the idea of these thoughts being implanted in your mind when you're a child 
[02:07:00]  before you have a choice.  That is a very insidious part of the religious process.  They get you when you're kids, before you have a choice to decide.  If you were 18 and they said, okay, now you may choose your religion, things would be  much different today.  Yeah.  There wouldn't be as many religious people in the world.  I'm sure of it.  You know?  It's when you have no choice and you have these thoughts planted in your mind.  It's like being the victim of child abuse.  This is all you know.  And then often you become a perpetrator yourself.  You know?  It's the same process. 
[02:07:30]  You are planted with these thoughts.  Your parents were planted.  Your grandparents were planted.  Your children are going to be planted.  And it perpetuates itself that way.  I've known people that have grown up in very strict religious families and they all end  up, effed up.  Just like sexually repressed, just guilt-ridden.  It all depends on what religion.  You know?  You're Jews.  Very guilt-ridden people.  You're Catholics.  Holy Jesus.  Don't even talk about sex.  Right.  You know the effort I had to put into banging a Catholic girl? 
[02:08:00]  They're the best, though, because they're filth bags.  Once you cross them over that threshold, once you scoop them up like Satan and take them  away, wow, they can't stop.  Yeah, bring a black friend with you.  All right, baby.  But here they are preaching against sex while they're taking these little boys into the altar  boys and having their way with them over the course of many decades without any legal  ramifications whatsoever.  I think one reason people get so mad is because deep down, I think they know. 
[02:08:30]  I think the majority of times, like that priest you said, I think deep down, because I have  my own faith with God and my own struggle, deep down you know that science is right.  It's hard not to acknowledge it, especially now, maybe 300 years ago, but having that called  into question in a way, you're kind of just trashing somebody's hope because that's sometimes  all people hang on to.  It's like you're taking the one thing that they can look forward to, like, well, at least  and saying it's crap, and you know it's crap.  But deep down, I think they know. 
[02:09:00]  But is it healthy to believe in an illusion?  Oh, no, I'm not saying it's wrong.  That's why they get so mad.  Yeah, I agree with you.  I think that's a very good point.  And to base your entire life on it, though, seems to me like you're just living this life  to serve so that it's better in the next one.  It's like, it seems to me to be an awful waste of time.  You don't have to serve.  You know, again, you have to just believe.  You don't have to do anything good.  You could be a complete asshole, but as long as you believe, you will have salvation. 
[02:09:30]  You know, so there's no real motivation to even be nice to somebody, basically.  Right, right.  As long as you're guaranteed your spot.  That's right.  That's right.  We could do another hour on this, but we got some panicky Pete's.  Look, you got the press people today?  The press people got their coats on and everything.  They're like, we got to get them out of here.  A big TV tour today?  I don't know what the hell I'm doing.  I hear like one of those satellite TV tours.  I just have been pushed into rooms and talked to people.  I don't know who they are.  We can talk to you for another hour.  I know.  I would have loved to have talked about Borat a little bit of Seinfeld, things like that.  Please, I'd love to come back.  Absolutely.  That'd be great. 
[02:10:00]  I'd love that.  Absolutely.  Thank you guys very much.  Come back later this week.  We'll just do part two of this interview.  Cool.  I'm serious.  I would love to.  If we can set that up, because phones are lit.  They all have great questions, but we've got to get them out of here.  It's such an interesting subject.  I love it.  Larry Charles, the director of Religious, starring Bill Maher.  A lot of laughs in the movie, by the way.  It's a good time.  That's the expense of God.  The religious truckers in the trailer park.  They have a little church in an actual trailer.  In a parking lot, yeah.  So much I want to get to, but we've run out of time.  Larry, thank you so much. 
[02:10:30]  Thank you very much.  All right.  Larry Charles, everybody.  And I think we've got to get out of here, too.  Wow.  Look at that.  We're splitting already.  All right.  Hey, Sunday night, I'm part of a George Carlin tribute panel.  It's at the Y here in New York on 92nd Street.  So you can go to Y, what is it, 923Y.org?  No, it's 92Y.org, but it's on ONARadio.com.  Okay, yeah.  All the info is on ONARadio.com.  Okay.  We're going to leave you with another Primetime Gossip, two in one day, from Sam Roberts.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  We're back, and the Primetime Gossip Mills are going bananas. 
[02:11:00]  Recently on the O&A show, Opie made an enormous announcement that soon one of the show's cast  members would be gone.  Someone very, very, very important to this radio show is leaving.  It's not myself, it's not Anthony, it's not Jimmy.  But someone that is very, very important to this radio show is leaving.  Opie left it there, and the listeners went wild, leading to much speculation as to exactly  who was leaving. 
[02:11:30]  However, Primetime Gossip was able to get some audio that may help clear up this situation.  Stun brains.  Stun brains.  Stun brains.  Hey, I was considering it, and then E-Rock and Danny both took the spoon and stuck it  back in.  That's right.  The Google-using mental midget wouldn't even have a scoop of ice cream with his co-workers.  There's the spoon.  No, it's already been violated.  See, I knew you were one of those.  There!  You're not one.  The evidence became clear. 
[02:12:00]  Mr. I Love Politics more than the O&A show himself, Stunt Brain, is obviously not a true  member of the Opie and Anthony family.  When are you going to be part of the team officially?  When are you going to, like, make everyone feel like you're part of this?  What do we have to do?  Well, right there, that was it.  The stuntster was high on the totem pole when he first came to the show, but after blowing  his chance to prove his loyalty, old Contribute Nothing Stunt Brain may justifiably be on  his way out the door. 
[02:12:30]  We'll keep you informed as this story unfolds, only on Primetime Gossip.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The Vice President, with your permission, I'd like to remain on your side.  I had a feeling you would.  And what happens if they do become hostile?  God help us.  God help us.  God help us.  There's going to be a lot of scared people out there. 
[02:13:00]  Did the President fly a mission in this one?  Of course he did.  He's a fighter pilot.  Shit!  You know I'm, I could do my best work in the air.  Really?  I think wise, maybe.  He's plummeting into a mountain.  Being sucked out of the fuselage of a fucking Hawaiian air flight.  Fucking cunt.  Marty, Marty.  Jamie says this building has an old bomb shelter.  We're heading down there now.  All right, everybody, head down to the basement.  Take it slow, don't run. 
[02:13:30]  Walk down to the basement.  There's no shame in hiding.  Oh, I better call my mother.  We got it.  Yes, you're gay.  You love cock.  Call your mother.  Over the top gay guy.  Over the top gay guy.  Yes, we get it.  These characters can be found in like any bad movie that's made.  It's just, in Independence Day, they really stood out.  Caricature.com.  It's all fucking, we get it.  The black guy's funny and crazy.  Yeah.  The Jew's a Jew that we get it. 
[02:14:00]  The gay guy is talking about his mother and his analyst.  Yeah.  You're a quirky New York Jewish guy who adores cock.  As exit, in the Latin sense of the word, adorare.  You fear cock as one fears the sun.  Jimmy, speaking of which, Harvey Feinstein, his character in Independence Day.  Or Firestein.  Did I say Feinstein?  Feinstein.  Oh, for four.  Oh, for fucking four.  I'm Harvey Feinstein. 
[02:14:30]  I'm gay too.  Hey, forget it.  What?  I just want to bring back one of my favorite bits, but if I mess up the setup, then how  am I supposed to do that?  Oh, no.  You didn't know.  You're saying Harvey Feinstein in Independence Day.  I did say that, right?  Yeah, what about him?  His character.  You think he, I don't know, likes cock?  Yeah, we've established that.  But even more than liking it.  Yeah.  The adoration.  The adoration of it.  Yeah.  Damn it, he loves it!  Can't resist him. 
[02:15:00]  Wow.  I love the run into the ground bits.  Of course.  I'm a big fan of those.  Larry Charles, what did you guys think, huh?  Really cool, man.  He was a very interesting guy.  I liked his take on it.  Yeah.  And it's amazing how angry people get when you really question.  Well, it's their faith, you know.  That's just it.  They get angry because they believe what they believe and what are you going to do? 
[02:15:30]  What are you going to do?  Faith.  What are you going to do?  Do you have faith?  Do you have faith?  I couldn't get into the one part because we ran out of time.  How the Jews get around the rules.  The Jews.  The electric.  Yeah, yeah.  The electric rules.  How do they do that?  The electric rule.  Well, David told us.  Well, you're not allowed to use electronics or any like modern day luxuries because of  what?  Electricity or something?  It'll be dead now if it wasn't my David.  David.  David.  It'll be dead now if it wasn't my David. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Apparently, they get away with it.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  Not David.  No, no.  What's up, David?  We're not wasting 40 minutes with you.  David, quickly, though.  I just want to know.  It is Rosh Hashanah, right?  You wasted our time on Friday.  It will be.  On sundown today.  Put them on the clock.  Sundown today.  Five minutes tops with David today.  Thank you.  Okay.  Sundown today is Rosh Hashanah.  That's correct.  Now, what does that mean?  That the Jews have to get home before sundown?  Is that one of those holidays?  Yes.  Okay.  Happy Jewish New Year.  What if we tied you up and made you stay here? 
[02:16:30]  What would happen to you as a Jew?  Seriously.  Maybe disappear.  Hmm?  Just disintegrate like a vampire in the sun.  What if we just got a chair and tied you up here and you couldn't get home before sundown?  Before sundown.  That wouldn't be very nice.  I understand that, but what would happen?  What do homeless Jews do?  Then I wouldn't get to celebrate the New Year.  How did you feel about our guest, Larry Charles?  What he was saying about religion and basically, not just Judaism, but all religions he was  premised on.  You know, he was poo-pooing them, if I may. 
[02:17:00]  Did you hear him?  I heard him, yeah.  Some people aren't in favor of religion.  Some people don't believe in it.  I mean, logic.  No, no.  I'm saying it logically.  Because I have my own things with God, too.  Like, I do believe, but then, like, it's so hard to deny.  I'm really caught in a weird place in my life.  Well, it's the organized religion angle that bothers me.  But even a God thing, you could pick, like, one single entity that created everything  and still wonder why, you know, through science we found out this, that, the other thing, free  will. 
[02:17:30]  I'll save everyone a lot of time.  God is an alien scientist.  That's all it is.  Yeah.  Seriously.  Big experiment?  I don't know if you want to go big experiment down that road, but he's just an alien from  another planet that we haven't discovered yet, probably will never discover.  Who made him.  And probably another, like, alien scientist from another.  See, we've just got to stop somewhere.  That's the conundrum.  There's no end.  Everything, it goes on and on until you have to get to the point where there is some type 
[02:18:00]  of divine entity that created things, or at least created the thing that was able to  make more things.  But everything has to end.  Like, the universe has to end.  It keeps going forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.  But at the end of that, it has to have something.  There's no end.  It's just infinite.  Infinite.  Like, let's say it ends with a wall, but then what's behind the wall?  Who's got pot?  Our brains aren't.  Who's got the pot?  I'll tell you what's behind the wall. 
[02:18:30]  Our brains aren't big enough to wrap ourselves around us.  I know.  A big TV and a giant chaise lounge.  That's right.  That's heaven to me.  I think the problem is that we just don't understand what nothing really is.  So when they say there's nothing here before, say, before the Big Bang, whatever you want  to call it.  Nothing.  Just nothingness.  Well, what was in the nothingness?  No, no.  But it's an absolute nothing of non-existence.  We just don't comprehend that.  It's something that doesn't exist.  Exactly.  It's just nothingness.  But what was there before the nothingness?  Nothing.  You wouldn't notice. 
[02:19:00]  Because there's nothing there.  But it had to be something.  No.  It didn't.  That's only...  It was something that was called nothing.  We can't understand it.  It didn't exist.  There was nothing.  So nothing existed.  But then again, how could fucking atoms appear to be something?  Thank you.  And atoms don't just appear.  Like, for no reason, there's nothingness.  And a couple of things show up and go, crash!  And here we are.  It's all just silly.  It's nonsense.  Maybe there is a God.  For Christ's sake.  What do I know?  By the way, I'm not an X-Files fan.  I've watched maybe 10 minutes of that.  That's my theory. 
[02:19:30]  The whole alien scientist.  I guess that's what?  That was the overall plot of X-Files?  Yeah.  Sort of.  I don't know.  Sort of.  Yeah, I agree with you.  I think it could be a part of it.  It's not that crazy.  I think it has something to do with an alien that started this whole thing.  And maybe they come and look at us once in a while to see how we're doing.  See how we're progressing.  And maybe they make themselves known when we socially progress to a certain point, when  we're a planetary unit, or when we have the ability to reach them.  Maybe that's one of those things.  There you go.  That's more of a Scientology type take on it.  Maybe they're right. 
[02:20:00]  Maybe Xenu or whatever has a point.  Maybe there is something to Scientology.  A point on his head.  Oh, come on.  Use your head for something other than a hat rack.  My father would say that before teabagging my mother in my view.  And he'd make her nose a Roman woman.  David.  Yes.  So in this movie, Religious, which you did not see because you weren't privy enough to,  because you're a coffee boy.  Right.  Like, Jews aren't allowed to use what?  Electricity and stuff every Friday or Saturday? 
[02:20:30]  On the Sabbath, right.  And on the high holidays.  So this is a high holiday.  Yes, that's correct.  So no electricity.  Right.  No electricity.  All right.  All right.  They can't turn on electricity.  So how do you say Happy New Year?  Without anything, you just go Happy New Year and light a goddamn candle?  Do you guess when the ball drops?  Yeah.  How do you watch Dick Clark if you can't turn the TV on?  Oy vey.  It's doing noon.  I bet you Dick Clark does it every year, but no one knows because they're not allowed to  turn on their TV.  Yeah.  Watch TV.  Hey.  So, all right.  We established that.  But in this movie, Religious, in Jerusalem, they visited this guy. 
[02:21:00]  His whole job is to come up with inventions that doesn't go against their religion, but  they could use electronics.  Oh, wow.  Have you heard of this?  No, I haven't heard of this.  You haven't heard of this stuff?  Well, someone's got to call in because they could have spent more time on this topic in  the movie.  But, I mean, there's some people out there that might have knowledge on this, but they've  learned how to use phones and all this stuff around the Sabbath, and it doesn't go against 
[02:21:30]  their religion.  I don't get it.  They're not one of the battery powers.  That's what it is, right?  Oh, David's five minutes are up.  Get the hell out.  Thank you.  David, take it easy.  By the way, happy Rosh Hashanah.  Thank you.  We would have gave you a couple extra minutes, but you didn't even have the answer to the  question we had for you.  But someone out there will.  Is your family celebrate with the blowing of the chauffeur?  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Who will be blowing the chauffeur?  No one in the family will blow the chauffeur.  They go to the synagogue, and the rabbi will blow the chauffeur.  Oh, so at the synagogue, the rabbi does that?  Yes.  Don't they do that at homes?  In homes?  No? 
[02:22:00]  Not in our home.  No, the rabbi does it.  Okay, the rabbi.  Did you ever try to fool them by wearing a chauffeur hat?  Yes.  To get blown?  The chauffeur hat.  Look at him laughing.  It's funny.  The chauffeur hat.  I get it.  When are we going to go to lunch?  Why would you go to lunch with him?  Are you buying?  Save your receipt.  Yes.  Thank you, David.  Oh, you're welcome.  Thank you, David.  And again, Happy New Year.  Happy Rosh Hashanah.  Happy New Year, David.  Thank you very much.  Say hi to everybody for us.  I certainly will.  What year is it, by the way, in the Jewish calendar, if I may? 
[02:22:30]  That's a good question.  It's like in the 57-something, 57-50, whatever.  4892.  It's not 4892.  It's already in 57.  4892.  What's up?  It's the year 5,700 and something?  Yes, it is.  From the Old Testament.  Wow.  Yes, it is.  The New Testament is based simply on Christ A.D.  That's all that matters.  That's all that matters.  It doesn't matter before that.  The year of our new earth.  So the earth started 5,700 years ago?  According to the Jews, that's correct.  Before Jesus.  There was no earth before that? 
[02:23:00]  Oh, we're all...  Of course there was.  Oh, we're all dying with no afterlife.  Let me ask you a question.  If the earth...  Oh, my God.  We're all dead and there's nothing.  Let's just be here.  Why would it just start then?  Like, we're not even in the middle of the Milky Way.  We're on the fucking outskirts of the shitty Milky Way surrounding a mediocre star.  We haven't even unwrapped the Milky Way yet.  We have not.  Because it's a candy bar.  How...  I didn't mean that.  How could it be that science has kind of really proven that the earth has been around for billions of years? 
[02:23:30]  Not in its current form exactly, but it has been.  It's kind of slowly turned into what we have now.  How is that explained that it's only 5,700 years?  It's not necessarily the earth, is that?  It's just like the year for the Jewish religion of the year.  Like when the Jewish religion first started.  Like when they started keeping track for the Jewish religion.  So it's possible that there were some primitive man walking around 10,000 years ago, 20,000 years ago. 
[02:24:00]  30,000 years ago.  With spears and stuff.  And 30,000 years ago.  40,000 years ago.  Just keep going.  Just keep going.  1,212,475 years ago.  Just do that until 11 o'clock.  Just keep going.  All right, we're out of here.  So you buy that?  I do.  Oh, okay.  You do.  But the religion itself thinks that 5,700 and some odd years, that's pretty much it.  That's what they believe, yes.  Poofed out of nothingness.  Correct.  How do they explain quasars and pulsars?  There you were. 
[02:24:30]  Quasars and pulsars.  Fuck that.  How about dinosaur fossils?  Let's just go with that.  That they can say we were here for the same time.  Like why would God all of a sudden create it and then throw all this weird shit in space?  Why wouldn't it just be us floating around with a giant light over us?  Right.  And cutting the malarkey, bub.  Yeah.  What's with all the other planets?  Yeah.  And what religion do they believe in?  Yeah.  Why so many other planets?  There are a lot.  Why does Jupiter turn quickly?  What is that?  Why does Jupiter so big?  And turns 10 hours a day.  Jupiter's 10 hours a day. 
[02:25:00]  Why does Saturn have brains?  I don't know.  That's a good question.  Yes.  What's the moon do?  Besides float around looking all dented?  The moon's a prick.  He's got to learn how to take it.  The moon's a faggot.  He fucking just follows our big earth cock around with his mouth open.  The moon's got to learn how to keep his hands up.  The moon does nothing but open its asshole for space rocks.  How about you block a few punches, moon?  I know.  Jesus.  Defend yourself.  Defend yourself.  It's a wreck.  You're like a woman with a bad childhood.  Kind of like Chuck Liddell.  You've got to get that arm up. 
[02:25:30]  That left arm up.  The moon is defenseless.  The moon is also known Vicky LaMotta.  No kidding, man.  Fucking moon stinks.  It really does.  Just so the earth likes you that it takes all the punches and rocks.  All right.  I like to fuck the moon right in the mouth.  A big smiley face.  Making a big frown.  Dumb moon.  The meteorites.  You can see them coming from miles and miles away.  How about you get ready for one of them?  Yeah, or you duck.  Right.  You fucking get nothing but space, faggot.  Right.  Move. 
[02:26:00]  Move your moon face.  Out of a way.  Stupid moon.  I hope the moon has AIDS.  Right.  Fucking shrinks up to even a smaller, worthless ball of rock.  Moon is the punching bag of the universe.  It really is.  She put a curly wig on it and fucking Brady Bunch music.  Right.  Right back to that, Jimbo.  She give it a Pete Rose haircut.  All right.  Where are we?  Oh, we're going to learn about turning the lights on and off in Brooklyn during the...  What? 
[02:26:30]  Did they get cups to turn?  Okay, let's say hi to Charlie in New York.  Charlie, so this is the question.  Religionalists, they could have got into it a little more, but during the Sabbath, the  Jews aren't allowed to use, like, you know, electronics and modern-day stuff.  But there's a guy, his whole job, he's got a company somewhere in Jerusalem where they  sell products that they could use that doesn't go against their religion, like electric wheelchairs  and such, Anthony.  Well, electric wheelchairs are probably pretty important.  But they're not electric, they've got some kind of, like, hydrogen fucking canister thing. 
[02:27:00]  Are you kidding me?  No, it was a good part of the movie.  What about lights in the house?  Oh, well, Jewish guys left.  We got Charlie.  What about lights in the house?  Like, is it just dark?  Gotta use candles.  Candles.  What about TV?  No TV.  What about life-saving stuff like the fucking iron lung?  Ah, what about an iron lung?  Charlie.  That would be...  Or dialysis.  Charlie.  Yes, Opie. 
[02:27:30]  We're waiting for your answer.  Yes.  Okay, I'm a retired police officer from Brooklyn, and in the 6-6 precinct, what we would call  the influential Jews used to get the cops to come to the house to turn the lights on  and off.  So if the light is on, then it has to stay on?  I believe so.  Brilliant.  And then if it's off...  So you pay a cop a few bucks.  Well, I don't know if they pay anybody to do anything.  That's silly.  Yeah, because you're also using it.  Is God going to go like, oh, you flipped the light switch, you're out? 
[02:28:00]  But no, the police did it.  It's okay.  Oh, okay.  You tricked me.  Oh, you.  Dog shit.  All right, let's go to Cody.  I'll believe in some wacky stuff.  Nonsense.  Cody.  Yes.  Okay.  I got two things real quick.  First of all, I understand the nothing.  I've seen the never-ending story, Jim.  I don't know.  What is the never-ending story?  It's a book by Michael Enda.  It's a fantasy world.  Everything's being destroyed because kids aren't reading books.  They have no memory of things.  So in the story, it's living in real time. 
[02:28:30]  So nothing exists where the kids' memories are because there's no fucking memory of anything.  Oh, I actually did not see that or read it.  All right.  Great.  I like getting my knowledge from movies, too, though.  I'm sorry.  You're either.  He just fell apart with this call.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  He's like, all right.  Gee, gee, gee, gee.  Joe from Texas.  I think he was shitting on me thinking I stole the idea from that story, which I really did not.  Oh, no.  Joe from Texas.  How do you do?  How do you do, Joe? 
[02:29:00]  We got Mars, Neptune, Mercury, Venus.  What's it about?  They rotate pretty good.  Yeah.  What's wrong with the planets we got?  What's some of those other planets we got?  Uh, Uranus, Uranus, Uranus, Mercury, Pluto, Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars.  What did he say?  The asteroid is between, I believe, Venus and Saturn. 
[02:29:30]  Can you make a living?  Let's see.  See, now I'm learning like Joe and Yonkers.  Comic Kahoota.  Oh, my God.  Super-novus.  Harry's calling.  Harry's calling.  Harry's calling.  Call it Hellbop. 
[02:30:00]  Joe Yonkers.  How are you, sir?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Good evening.  Hello, sir.  Around here, right?  I work in a hospital.  Yeah, sure.  I got a radio show.  Yeah.  Big deal.  I tell jokes.  Elevators run and stop on every floor on the Jewish holiday so the Jewish people don't  have to press buttons.  Oh, right.  So it stops on every single floor.  Yep.  Imagine what a pain in the ass that is.  It's so annoying.  Well, they're all doctors.  You need the Jews there.  That's true.  It's a library without Jews.  It's a library without books. 
[02:30:30]  God's not paying attention to that stuff.  The elevator.  I saw you.  You pushed five.  Right.  You're going to hell or whatever.  Wherever you go.  Yeah, what do Jews do, sir?  If they're doctors, they need electricity.  What do they do?  I don't know.  Thank you for half the help.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Dana, who has a question about the cops turning on the lights.  Dana.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  We're in here.  Hey, I'm going to call that first cop out, but how are they going to call the cops to  turn the lights on and off if they can't use a fucking phone? 
[02:31:00]  Are they going to blow a rape whistle or something?  Well, maybe it was a prearranged thing.  Yeah.  Maybe they make a deal ahead of time saying, hey, the Sabbath is coming.  Those Jews are sneaky.  Oh, boy.  Jesus.  All right, boys.  Touch out.  Let's say hi to Colin in Florida.  Colin.  In Florida.  Sunshine State.  Don't invite me.  I get angry.  That's very funny.  Colin.  Hey, oh, that's actually the reason answering machines were invented, so they didn't have 
[02:31:30]  to answer the phone on their Sabbath.  Well, the phone they showed in the movie had some, like, pencil in it or something.  They took the pencil out, and then all of a sudden it was connected to, I guess, your  loved ones.  Wow.  Maybe I fell asleep.  I don't get it.  Yeah.  No one's answering my question today.  What's your question?  Basically, there's companies out there that get around this whole using of electricity  so their lives don't suffer as much as they probably suffered, you know... 
[02:32:00]  Many years ago.  Many years ago.  Sure.  So they keep God happy, but they also get to continue doing some stuff with the electricity.  Yeah.  No one has the answer to this riddle.  Oh, God.  Answer.  Let's go to Adam in Jersey.  Adam.  Hi.  How are you doing?  All right.  Yeah, the Jews in Brooklyn, the Hasidic Jews, I'm a member of PETA, and what they do is  on the PETA website, you can check this out, there's a thing called caporos, and what they 
[02:32:30]  do is they take a live chicken, wave it over their head, and allegedly the chicken takes  on the sins, and then they spar to the chicken.  Stop.  Yep.  That sounds very old or a sect that, like, isn't very popular.  Right.  Now it's the Hasidic, they truck in, like, 15,000 chickens every year.  I used to live in Brooklyn, and I never remember seeing that.  I'm telling you, PETA sends out a thing, they just sent it out.  All right, well...  I saw a bunch of idiots trying to cross Ocean Parkway very friggin' hazardously. 
[02:33:00]  To get to the other side.  Yes.  Why did the Jew...  Charles is back, he says, Jews walked to precinct to get cops to turn lights on, and then we  got this, Mike on Long Island.  Mike!  Mike!  Hey, God, what's going on?  All our names are coming in today.  I install home automation systems, and the Jews pay us to automate all of their stuff  so that they don't have to touch anything.  Oh, like timers and stuff?  Yeah, timers, astronomical clocks, all that kind of crazy shit. 
[02:33:30]  Astronomical clocks.  Ooh, that sounds scary.  But isn't that going against God?  There was a reason why he didn't want you using these modern-day luxuries, and now you're  getting...  They outsmarted.  But you're outsmarting God.  Yeah.  Isn't God going to get you in the end and go, look, there was a reason why  I did this, and you're breaking the rules still?  Yeah, like they're going to say to God, but the officer turned it off, and he's going  to go, hey, cunt, I'm God.  This is not a small claims court where you fucking eke out on a technicality.  A loophole.  You found a loophole with God?  I said no lights. 
[02:34:00]  You had lights.  You're fucking going to hell.  Yeah.  Go fuck yourself.  Wow.  Justin makes...  Exactly.  Justin makes a very good point.  We're trying to get to the bottom of this question, and Justin, what do you have?  Hey, fellas.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  How do y'all expect some Jew to call that's listening to the radio right now, pick up the  phone and call, and tell you the answer?  Yeah.  Why don't you ask tomorrow?  Yeah, they're not really allowed to be listening to radio today, so this is the wrong day to  ask this.  Very good. 
[02:34:30]  Rachel, what's up?  Good evening.  Hello.  I work for Jews, and what they do is...  We all do, on some level.  Yeah, what do you think, your alarm?  I'm doing stand-up for 18 years.  You think club owners are all Irish?  I'm kidding.  You're saving up to me, Jewish.  Yeah, she said it like, I work for a Somalian.  Even Barnes found it funny. 
[02:35:00]  I know.  She said it like, I work for a Somalian.  You're acting like...  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  They set all their lights on timers, like that other guy said, but they also do the  ovens, they set their ovens on before the Sabbath, real low, so they can use them all weekend  or during that time, so they don't have to turn them on so they can have hot food.  Oh, fucking annoying.  What'd they stop?  Just say, look, that's kind of nonsense.  We're going to keep the shit on.  Yeah.  We're in better language than that. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, maybe.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Let's go to...  I'm Jewish.  Let's go to Mark.  Mark.  Mark.  Yes, hi.  Hi.  Hello?  You're here, Mark.  We're on.  What's up, Mark?  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, guys.  A couple things.  One, I'm Jewish, so I know a lot about this stuff.  Boo!  No, I don't have a radio show, but Colin Powell, who's not Jewish, was what's called the Shabbos 
[02:36:00]  Goy, meaning he's someone who's not Jewish, who'd come in on the Sabbath, prearranged,  and would turn things on, and you can't say to them, hey, you know, turn on the light  or turn on the oven and say, oh, you know, it's kind of dark in here, isn't it?  And they turn the light on, and old-timers kind of do that.  Still, some people do it.  Isn't that weird, because I'm listening to your story, but I'm thinking of Travis's  house, where a Jewish guy came in and turned something on Travis's mom. 
[02:36:30]  That's right.  Actually, what happened was, here's how they met.  She went to his house, because he had prearranged that she would get a deep digging while her son  was at college.  Yeah, perhaps that was it.  She was the one that came over to flip on the switches?  That's right, and she goes, oh, my goodness, there's a fire plug here, and she sat on it,  and he said, no, that's my cock.  And she said, well, I'm going to call it the womb wrecker.  And she wrote a Colonel Kurtz-like fucking letter, goodbye to the family, goodbye to everything, 
[02:37:00]  I got a Jew cock, and I'm never coming home.  He knocked that Goyim's fucking, he knocked her hat off.  He fucked her so deep and so hard her hat fell off.  And it was one of those fucking hats that Abilia Earhart wore that was really on there.  A snug fit.  Oh, yeah, she had a fucking leather flying hat on, and he fucked it off.  That man fucked a leather flying hat off.  Wow, did Travis's mom get fucked good?  Oh, she got fucked well. 
[02:37:30]  Damn.  Travis, comment?  Yeah, he's thumbs up in it.  He hasn't heard from his mom in many years.  That's why he clings with so much love to that fucking dog.  I know.  It's just misplaced fucking affection that he's missing from mother.  I hope a Jewish man runs it over by accident.  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  Yeah, like fucking Crown Heights gets out.  I'm sorry!  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you got?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, what if you're a Jew, and it's Rosh Hashanah, and you have a heart attack, and they've got to use those electric paddles on you? 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, and then you're blowing off your religion real quick.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  I think you have to...  I'm not going to help this Christian boy.  Trash Hashanah.  Can't use the paddle.  My moment has passed.  My moment's passed.  I don't have my joke anymore.  It was a good one.  He took up time.  No, it was just, you know, better than a throwaway, but not as good as a real zinger.  Well, you should say it, then, if it doesn't matter now, because we know the moment passed. 
[02:38:30]  It won't count as a bomb.  Okay.  It won't count as a bomb.  If it bombs, it won't count.  You can't even keep this straight face.  I'm not even kidding.  No, I'm not kidding either.  I'm not saying it.  The guy stepped on you, so it's, like, understandable.  Jimmy's right.  It's in the opening.  I totally forgot it already.  I really did.  It just slipped right out of my head.  It's in the handbook, though.  Jimmy was right about that one.  Like I would say it.  We've got a Jewish doctor, Derek Long Island.  Hey, guys.  How you doing? 
[02:39:00]  I went to school with a lot of Orthodox Jews, and you get special dispensation if you're  doing things like saving lives, et cetera, so you're actually allowed to do that.  Oh, special dispensation.  Yeah.  Punching up.  And who decides that?  Well, I don't know.  Probably the rabbi or something like that.  Whoever the pope of Jews are.  Who's the pope of the Jews?  Well, what if the rabbi decided that?  He decided wrong, and now this rabbi...  Everybody's got to pay.  Now this rabbi fucked up your eternity.  See, that's why the pope is infallible. 
[02:39:30]  He says things.  If he makes up a rule, and then the Catholics follow it, like they still go to heaven, because  you know, the pope's infallible.  But I don't know if the Jewish pope, whatever that is, makes up rules.  I don't know if they have the same thing, where God will just go, ah, look, the pope said  that, ah, I guess, you know, he's infallible.  I don't know.  It's an odd thing.  I work for the sanitation department.  All right.  Well, we got to go back to Brooklyn. 
[02:40:00]  It's a hotbed of Jewish.  It really is.  Yes, it is.  Of course it is.  How are you, Joe?  How do you do, Joe?  Why the delay on the phones today, man?  Something's up.  How's it going, boys?  Hey.  All right, though, and now I'm commenting about one of the calls we called about the  chickens, killing the chickens and stuff.  Mm-hmm.  I work for the sanitation department right there in Borough Park, and they actually have  a truck that goes around to all the synagogues and all the designated areas to pick up all  the chicken guts and crap. 
[02:40:30]  Real nasty stuff, man.  Well, they're just fucked up.  So they are doing stuff with chickens, savages, fucking killing animals.  Why don't people just stop?  All right.  My whole statement.  Why don't people just stop?  I just, my childlike observation, I ran out of steam immediately.  Fuck the animals.  I eat chicken all the time.  You want to slaughter it?  Go ahead.  Fuck it for all I care.  That is an animal holocaust going on with chickens.  We've talked about that, believe me, and had some very entertaining animations done about  it.  Oh, the chicken slaughterhouse. 
[02:41:00]  One of my favorites.  Eric DC, how are you?  Hey.  The rule is that if it's a matter of your life or your health, you don't have to follow  the other rules.  Why?  If it's a rule, it should be good.  Your life or your health.  Well, because they don't want you to, you know, if you're starving to death, you can  have a pork sandwich.  They're not going to get on your case about that.  Oh, for eating like swine.  I just don't dig on swine.  But you decide that.  Then God goes, you know what?  I looked at all the paperwork, and you really weren't starving.  Well, then when Yom Kippur rolls around, the thing you're toning for is anything you 
[02:41:30]  did to violate your promise to God.  So why not just flick the lights on, have a ball, then Yom Kippur comes along.  You're all right.  You got me.  Sorry.  That's why they're Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah Jews, because that's what they do.  Oh, so you're rock and rolling all the way to Yom Kippur.  Yep.  And then it's a make good.  Yep.  I love it.  Make good.  We're learning about the Jews today.  Yeah.  A make good.  Thank you. 
[02:42:00]  Who could think there'd be make goods?  I know.  It's like confession.  Yeah.  Confessions are make goods.  They sure are.  You can pretty much do whatever the fuck you want and then get in that little phone booth,  and it's a make good.  You tell the man who may or may not have diddled a child's penis, and then you have your active  contrition, and then you go home and do it all over again.  Sure.  Now we learn about the special toilet, or what we like to say, the turlet.  Boom.  Mike in Boston.  It's the mouth of a lucky boy.  Mike in Boston listening on BCN. 
[02:42:30]  See, I say that every morning knowing everyone's listening on XM.  Good morning.  How are you guys doing?  What's up, Mike in Boston?  How are you?  Good, good.  I'm a civil engineer with a firm just outside of Boston.  Yeah, sure.  We did a Jewish elderly housing project, and we came up with a design, the cost, and then  they said, oh, by the way, we can't use an electricity Friday and Saturday, and we  had to go back to the drawing board, increase the tanks and the pumps.  When they got the extra cost for the increased size capacity to the tank, the guy, the head 
[02:43:00]  of the association says, well, you know, maybe if we couldn't hit it running, it'd be  okay, so we don't have to spend the extra $30,000.  So as long as they couldn't hear it running, it's all right to use electricity so their  toilets don't pack up in their living rooms.  Oh, boy.  The second they want to spend extra money on it, it's an issue.  Oh, boy.  The spaceman's going to be really mad at that one.  That's not good.  No.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Take care.  Thanks.  Boss of Jews is Grand Ravai. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  How did Jews know about electricity so long ago?  I'm an orthodox Jew.  Here we go.  Steve in New York.  Steve?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you very much, Steve.  It's appreciated.  Yeah.  I just wanted to comment on what Eric said before from D.C. is the number one law is that  life and health supersedes the other laws.  Nobody's looking for anybody to kill over and pass out to follow the rule.  So that's the number one rule.  Okay.  So that, like, supersedes all other rules.  Yeah, and as far as who makes that judgment call, I mean, you've got to make some personal 
[02:44:00]  decisions in life.  And, you know, we do have traditions, and we do have our rabbis, and you don't run to the  rabbis and say, I'm starving to death.  That really doesn't happen much in the 21st century.  No.  What if you screw up, though?  Make the wrong decision?  If you screw up, you try, you feel bad about it, and you try to move on and do the right  thing.  Is there a holiday or some kind of thing where you can atone for that?  Yeah, well, you keep on the day of atonement, but it doesn't work like you say, I'm going  to screw up, and I'm going to go get it fixed afterwards.  You really need to have the right intentions, and if you happen to screw up, then you try 
[02:44:30]  to fix it afterwards.  Okay.  You can't just walk into it and say, I'm going to a confession booth, and I'm going to  go eat a ham sandwich and go fix it afterwards.  That's what Catholics can do.  You know, in the end, we all end up in hell because no one's going to have a perfect score  card.  No!  We're all going to, like, think we're doing the right thing.  It turns out we weren't doing the right thing.  We weren't doing the right thing.  And if you don't need a perfect score card to get in, then why try to get the perfect  score card?  Right.  And if you make one mistake and you're out, then, oh, that's right. 
[02:45:00]  No one's getting in.  No one's getting in.  And my problem with my Catholicism, when they change the rules, right?  The Vatican Pope changes the rules.  Yeah.  And, you know, you get scared with this health thing burning forever and ever, but I think  if you burn forever and ever, it just becomes what it is, and you deal with it.  You're just like, ow.  How much screaming can you get done?  You're like, all right, this is my eternity.  You tell the new guy, like, the first fucking 3,000 years really sucks.  Like, it really stings.  Right.  But then, it kind of gets a little easier. 
[02:45:30]  Like anything else.  Yeah.  And then it's not so bad.  Like, look at me.  I'm bubbling away here.  I'm boiling.  But what about all the people in hell, like, doing some serious tough times, and then the  Pope or whoever, like, changes the rules, and now you don't go to hell for this anymore?  Do you have to stay in because the law was the law like that?  Or do you get to go to heaven for a rule that you broke that the Pope all of a sudden  says isn't a bad thing anymore?  Or does someone post your bail and you're out?  Yeah.  And are there levels of hell, like, for a mass murderer, child molester, killer guy, is he 
[02:46:00]  in the same agony and pain in hell as somebody who ate, you know, meat on Friday or something?  Right.  Yeah.  Do you think the guys complain, like, if you're next to a kid fucker, and all of a sudden  you're like, but I had ham.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, could I get somebody in here?  I got to talk to somebody.  Yeah.  Can I be represented?  And, of course, everyone there is a lawyer because that's the joke. 
[02:46:30]  They're all lawyers in hell.  Oh, here we go.  Boo-hoo.  Boo-hoo.  B-double-O.  Let's go to Jeff in Arizona.  Jeff.  Jeff.  Yeah, my girlfriend, she's Jewish, and she always, uh, ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey.  Oh, no. 
[02:47:00]  Ba-ba-booey, ba-ba-booey.  Is he doing this for real?  I think he is.  We thought it was a joke at first.  It would be a funny joke.  Oh, my God.  I'll wait it out.  Me, too.  I got a smoothie in front of me. 
[02:47:30]  He hung up.  Oh.  Was that all you had?  What's the matter, faggot?  You run out of breath?  Call back and do it some more.  Yeah.  You had the ears of everybody there.  Yeah.  You had the radio station.  It was all yours, and that's all you could do.  My favorite part is when they eventually have to realize, we're not going to cut you off. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Oh, no.  We're really not.  Yeah.  Can we take a break, Dan?  I have to piss.  Yeah, I got pee, too.  I'll pee pee.  Yeah.  Okay.  We go pee-pee.  We'll be ready to pee.  We're still confused by the Baba Booey call.  Maybe that guy could call back and say he was for real or kidding, because we honestly don't know. 
[02:48:30]  And the sad part about this, that, if it was real, the last time we were at Sirius, we probably talked to Gary for 10, 15 minutes in.  Yeah, we're all one big happy family now.  See?  See how that works?  We were hanging out with our old boss, Jeremy, and Gary came in to say hi, and we were, like, kind of catching up on things.  Yeah.  Talking about all kinds of shit.  I have no idea if that was real or not.  The Baba Booey thing is so fucking silly to do. 
[02:49:00]  It's just, it's like, oh, God, dude, what are you doing?  Like, it was funny when he first did it, because he was telling part of the story, and then he breaks into it, and you're just kind of like, oh, dude, you're not really doing this, are you?  I guess he is.  Unless he just was in a DeLorean, and it was, you know, 1988, let's say, or 85, it perhaps could have just been, right, it could have just been 85, and he had set it back to go, you know, to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance. 
[02:49:30]  What was that, November 10th, 1955?  I believe he went back to November 10th, 1955.  And instead, something happens, lightning struck the DeLorean, and he went to today, 2008.  Dear God, proof that you are real, and have the Baba Booey guy call back, please.  And he thought it would be funny, because then the DeLorean radio came on, and he was listening to Opie and Anthony, and he goes, you know, let me call these guys and do the Baba Booey, because it's 1985. 
[02:50:00]  So he did it, and it didn't work, because, you know, it's really 2008.  So hopefully he went back to 85, and he's all well and fine now.  On the road of the dice.  Yeah, sing it, Huey.  Oh, Huey?  This is Huey Lewis.  Huey Lewis.  Fucking sucks. 
[02:50:30]  I love Huey.  We had no idea not like Huey Lewis.  He fucking sucks.  Dude, I sometimes just put Huey Lewis and blast it through my house.  He is.  I know he was a good guest, too.  I know.  I do.  I heard he has a huge cock.  His music is back in time.  It's unlistenable.  That's better than his.  Oh, here I go now. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  What's wrong with Huey, Jimmy?  Do we have our Toodly-Doo CD today?  Our Toodly-Doodly-Doo.  Our Toodly-Doo. 
[02:51:30]  Our Toodly-Doo.  Our Toodly-Doo.  Our Toodly-Doo.  Our Toodly-Doo.  Our Toodly-Doo.  Our Toodly-Doo-Doo.  Our Toodly-Doo.  Our Toodly-Doo.  Hey, Jeff in Arizona.  This is the Baba Booey guy.  Jeff.  Baba Booey.  Baba Booey.  Baba Booey.  No, no, no.  Jeff.  Jeff.  You get that point.  I wasn't.  Were you real or fucking without?  Like...  You know what it is?  I absolutely love your damn show.  Okay.  I called in the very first show you guys had and I Baba Booey'd you.  Asshole.  I've done it like three times since.  You know, I just get a kick out of it.  I love you guys to death, little Jimmy. 
[02:52:00]  Thank you.  I fantasize about having mad, passionate sex with you.  Thank you.  Stand in line.  Baba Booey.  Baba Booey.  Baba Booey.  Baba Booey.  There you go.  Just don't do that until I come.  That will ruin my heart on you.  Baba Booey, Baba Booey.  This could be the start of something.  Now, Jeff.  In Jeff's world, he's the Baba Booey guy for our radio show.  Yeah.  I want to hear from other people out there that what is their thing that we have no idea about?  Oh, that he's the guy.  Like, Jeff, in his world, he's like, yeah, you know the Baba Booey guy from O&A?  That's me.  That's me. 
[02:52:30]  So what else do we got?  What else?  What other budding stars are out there?  Yes, out there that we have no idea about.  Like, I'm the ransom guy from the Ramsey household.  Let's get that cut up on.  I'm the garage guy.  I'm the Johnny Ola character from the Ramsey crime.  Hey, the answer to the question, by the way, with one day, two days left, whatever it is,  we're still working on it, Popeye.  Oh.  That's the answer.  Yes.  You can bet we are.  Hey.  Which toodly-doo do you want today, Anthony? 
[02:53:00]  A toodly-doodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Surprise me.  I love hearing a good song remade with nothing but a fucking toodly-doo pan flute.  In honor of our God discussions today.  Yes.  Why don't we do this one?  Can I?  This is our toodly-doo song of the day.  How funny it was, because Ant was so mean to Gray.  It was, because Ant's not a mean guy.  No, I...  And the minute he was playing this song, and I kind of liked it, and then they obnoxious 
[02:53:30]  belch.  I just belched him.  And he was just awful.  I never do that.  It was really funny.  It was just how fucking belligerent he was being a gray wolf.  Poor guy has no home.  I know.  And every time he'd play, he'd be like, oh, Christ.  It's horrible.  It's like, oh, here he gets this again.  It's horrible.  People out there, they're not even close to knowing the members of this show.  So, the fact is, he is the most horrific one.  Yeah, he's a piece of shit.  He's a piece of shit.  And let it be known that I'm pointing to Anthony. 
[02:54:00]  Now, if you did a poll, most people would say me.  Yes.  Nine out of ten would say, oh, he's the biggest dick on the show.  You're right.  Fuck no.  Not even close.  Yeah.  Oh, it's close.  All right.  You don't get carried away.  All right.  Fucking who are you?  Mother Teresa.  I'm not even in the stratosphere.  Yeah, you are.  Yeah.  All right, well.  Fuck.  That was just so funny to hear Anthony's such a dick to grapple.  It was so unnecessary.  It was uncalled for completely.  It was as unprovoked an attack as I've ever seen. 
[02:54:30]  It was terrible.  What are you doing?  The bit has legs, sort of.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  Well, I'm the instant feedback guy.  Second only to that cut Steven S.  See, that's his claim to fame on this, on this, on this, on this, on this, on this.  Someone hit him in the head.  Freddie from Mercury.  You're on the phone.  I've lost a lot of weight.  Here's the toodly-doo song of the day.  The toodly-doo-doodly-doo. 
[02:55:00]  In honor of our God discussion.  Yes, please.  Nice so far.  Ah.  I know what this is.  Where's the toodly-doo?  Maybe it's not.  This is just nice.  All right.  Stop it.  Stop it. 
[02:55:30]  Quiet.  Stop it.  I want an Asian finger in my rectum when I get this.  Above us, all this.  Oh, no words.  That's right.  Toodly-doo-ly.  A toodly-toot-dee-doo-doo.  Oh, I got it now. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, drums.  Toot, toot, toot, toot-ly-doo. 
[02:56:30]  Toot, toot, toot-ly-doo.  You toot.  Toot, toot, toot-ly-doo.  Oh, harmonies.  I'll do it.  Toot, toot, toot-ly-doo. 
[02:57:00]  Stop whining.  Toot, toot-ly-doo-doo.  Toot-ly-doo. 
[02:57:30]  Toot-ly-doo.  That's my favorite part.  Toot, toot-ly-doo.  Toot-ly-doo.  Toot-ly-doo.  Toot-ly-doo.  Toot, toot, toot, toot.  Don't you love the irony?  You can say, I toot-ly-doo.  But I'm not the only toot-ly-doer. 
[02:58:00]  Not the only father.  Toot, toot, toot-ly-doo.  Toot, toot-ly-doo.  Toot-ly-doo.  Toot-ly-doo-ly-doo. 
[02:58:30]  And there you have it.  The toot-ly-toot song of the day.  I love the toot-ly-doo.  We're going to have to find more discs.  Because I like that bit.  I just love the homeless guy playing Imagine.  Imagine no possessions.  Yes.  Imagine no soap.  Best you can.  Imagine being bludgeoned by teenagers.  Imagine shitting outdoors in the cold.  Imagine rock-hard shit in my undies.  It's easy if you're an intern.  Imagine your brain splattered all over the last thing you signed. 
[02:59:00]  I guess you didn't, or you wouldn't have signed it.  You'd have kept going.  I'll say hi to Dave in Massachusetts.  Imagine no hat, because it got shot off.  Imagine your friend is a pudding head.  Why?  He's got hat with gutters.  Still makes Anthony laugh.  Toot-ly-doo.  Imagine your friend's wig has tapioca in it. 
[02:59:30]  A bowl cut.  Dave in Massachusetts.  Hey, Dave.  Yeah, you know Opie's nicer to the homeless by the treat-yourself cake-stomping incident.  Linger longer.  Ah, leelay.  What can I say about that?  It's true, you did.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You did.  Toot-ly-doo, toot-toot-toot-toot.  Holy mackerel, what's that noise?  What happened?  Just a...  It was.  I hear that noise when I cum in my own head. 
[03:00:00]  That's the sound I hear.  When you cum in your own head?  Yes, I do.  I drill a Ted Kennedy hole and argolode into it.  I sent it on Wednesday, and then I resend it on Friday.  You resend it.  What did you resend on Friday?  Hope it's a stool shampoo.  Hey, my bad, guys.  Hey, give me a second.  Sorry about that.  Hey, look, I'm the jerk-off that's been calling WFAN ESPN Radio, calling up these guys on  here and telling them I want to slap their buttcheeks.  I'm not sure if you guys have seen that crap on YouTube.  Yeah.  That's you?  That's you.  Claim to fame. 
[03:00:30]  That's me.  Why have you been doing that?  Get that audio.  I wanted to see how it sounds.  What's that?  No, we're going to go find that.  We're going to find that.  Thank you.  And if you would be a deer, if you call one of these shows, if you would plug Down and  Dirty with Jim Norton, it would be very appreciated.  Oh, well.  Not a problem, Jim.  Thank you.  I want to slap your buttcheeks.  Thank you.  I would like some gorilla advertising.  If the fans would help me, it would be very appreciated.  Literally.  Get a gorilla.  Yeah.  And run around town.  Put a sign on him.  Yes.  Love that.  And people can just punch it.  Oh.  And he's just ripping people apart. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Like gorillas do.  They get all angry.  What a bad advertisement that is.  He bit my face and then shit on me.  He climbed a building.  He bit my genitals off.  They tend to like doing that.  Yeah.  He ripped my testicles off.  Where was I supposed to go?  What was that plug that was written on?  A sandwich board?  Yeah.  A sandwich board on a gorilla.  You're trying to read the plug and all of a sudden he just pounces on you.  Fucking plucks your eyes out so you can't watch it anyway.  Shit's in the holes that are left in your head.  Oh, gorillas are horrid.  Let's see how Todd and Grand Rapids mission. 
[03:01:30]  It's a rough and tumble.  What's up, Grand Rapids?  Hey there, Ted.  Morning, boys.  I want to be the guy who's the first to call it a toodly douche.  A toodly toodly douche.  A toodly douche.  Let's go to John in California.  John.  I haven't said frunkus in two years.  No, it's been a while.  Frunkus!  Wow.  People are going to think it's a best of.  John, California?  No, they're not.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just want to say I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, and I was looking at my little 
[03:02:00]  XM receiver when I got in my car, and I said toodly douche.  I was like, oh, all right.  Turned on the radio, and got to say, Anthony, you've brightened my day, and now I'm ready  to go to work.  Oh, well, that's great.  I'm glad I could help brighten your day.  It's all right.  Love you guys.  I hope he toodly douche into a fucking abutment.  So do I.  On this way to work.  He should say turdly douche, because he's shit. 
[03:02:30]  Steven S. from Bayshore.  He has sent this line in a hundred times.  He loves this line.  He just wants us to say this.  It is a good line, by the way.  Oh, Jesus.  I'd like to plug Jill Nicolini's new HBO show, Brown and Squirty.  Oh.  Jeepers.  Because, you know, I feel bad.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  It's Down and Dirty with Jim Norton, HBO, this Friday night at midnight.  Or is it Saturday night at midnight?  It's Friday right after Bill Marshall.  Friday.  Florentine's on this episode, a couple of the comedians, and Artie Lying. 
[03:03:00]  It's a really good episode.  But those are Howard guys.  How does that make sense?  Why?  What are you doing, Jimmy?  That doesn't make sense.  Florentine's not a Howard guy.  Florentine's a fucking Jim Norton guy.  Florentine got Jim Norton as his first paid gig in comedy in 1990.  You guys were roomies.  Fuck yeah, man.  I remember, recently I saw that Cribs.  What?  From Jimmy's house with the mold.  Oh, words, yeah.  Yeah, it was great.  Yeah, man.  Fucking, that was my, 30 years old, I finally moved out of my house.  Yeah, 30. 
[03:03:30]  Let's see how to Mike in California.  I was older than that, Jim.  Mikey?  Hey.  Hey, this is Mike in California.  What's up, man?  Um, I sent you guys some Apple help desk questions last night through the onaradio.com.  Yep.  Did you?  Is this actually you?  Yeah.  Well, no, it's not me, but I've had those since I, for years, and I thought they were hilarious,  and I thought you guys would get a kick out of them.  That shit's hilarious.  So what, you, uh, how'd you get these?  Um, just years and years ago, my friend built a computer for me and threw them on my hard 
[03:04:00]  drive, and they were just funny.  All right.  How many we got today?  A couple?  I sent you guys maybe like six or seven.  He sent a bunch, but, uh, this was one that was good.  One out of the bunch?  All right, hold on, Mike.  One of them is good.  All right, hold on, Mike.  Okay.  I can do anything for you that a supervisor can do.  Um, I'm telling you that there's no one here who can help you. 
[03:04:30]  Can I have a supervisor, please?  No, sir.  You may not talk with the supervisor.  Um, I can give you the number for the Customer Assistance Center if you wish to file a complaint.  I do wish to file a complaint.  Okay.  Their number is 1-800-776.  And I will file a complaint.  Okay, you're more than welcome to do that.  Um, I believe anyone you talk to will tell you that if you need help with software that  Apple does not make, you have to call it.  Listen, don't talk to me like some stupid idiot.  I know what I'm talking about, and you don't know what you're talking about. 
[03:05:00]  Okay, sir, well, um...  And you should learn to be nice to people.  You shouldn't be nasty.  You should be cooperative.  I can't help you if I don't know how, sir.  Listen, don't talk to me that way.  I'm a human being and I'm a person.  And you don't have a lie to talk condescending to me.  And don't talk down to me.  Who the hell do you think you are?  I asked to speak to your supervisor.  I don't have to tell you why I want to talk to your supervisor. 
[03:05:30]  Who the hell do you think you are?  You got so young.  Well, I apologize if I upset you, sir.  Wow.  I love how his anger just built.  The guy who's yelling is an ass, but I hate these fucking customers.  Even though Apple...  Let me tell you something about fucking Apple, who I love.  Always saying, we don't support non-Apple things.  Then don't...  Like certain things.  Then don't fucking promote them on your fucking website. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Like certain apps.  Yeah?  Don't sell them from my fucking iPhone if they're not ready.  What happened?  What app did you get?  It's just like the AIM one that sucks.  Or how about MobileMe?  Apple does certainly support that, but you can't get phone support for it.  Only online support.  Oh, shit.  How about this?  Before you fucking sell something like MobileMe, Steve Jobs, how about you make sure it's fucking  ready? 
[03:06:30]  How about that?  They want to get everything out there really quickly.  Yeah, sure.  How about you make a battery that lasts longer than an hour and a half when I have the features  that you allow running on it?  They've gotten so much better with that with video games, but it used to be...  They used to want to hit their launch date to the point where they would put games out  that were broken.  Fucking broken.  And you'd wait for the patch.  How many times do you have to fucking wait?  For the patch.  You'd buy the game, you'd start playing it, it would suck ass, freeze up, crash, fucking 
[03:07:00]  clip, whatever problem it had.  And then they'd be like, oh, yeah, we'll just fuck it.  And they knew it.  The guys at the game company were like, we'll just put it out and then we'll patch it later.  And you had to pay for the patches.  Didn't you?  No, it was usually just downloadable from their site, but it was a pain in the ass  and everything.  But just the fact that, you know, what the fuck?  Oh, yeah, I've been fascinated by this commercial, too.  Oh, okay.  It's the dog and cat nail clipper commercial, and they're trying to sell you the one that 
[03:07:30]  like files his nails round instead of cuts them.  And they show a cross section of a cartoon little doggy nail.  Inside that doggy nail is a nerve ending.  It's the pulp.  It's like the pulp of a tooth.  When you get to that, oh, boy, they're not going to be happy.  And if you hit it, the quick, I think they call it.  Right.  And if you, they show like someone clipping the nail and it cracks into that part.  And you just know the dog's like, they don't care.  You can kick a dog in the balls.  It doesn't hurt him like it does a person after you lick him. 
[03:08:00]  But most of us have no idea.  So you just take whatever scissors and go, whatever.  Take care of your nails, little doggy.  Fucking hammer.  You're slipping right through nerves, basically.  With that little fucking Dexter dog, I'd do it with a goddamn chainsaw.  Cut his feet off.  I use a lawnmower.  Put your paws into that shit, dick.  And I kick the cat like that guy who fucking is on trial.  Oh, the old cat kicker.  That guy's in the news every fucking day, that trial.  Like, it's the trial of the century, this thing.  Who cares?  Some guy kicked his chick's cat. 
[03:08:30]  Good.  Where's the media coverage of the fucking black guy, that group that fucking attacked  Christopher Newsome and cut his cock off?  Where's the fucking faggot media's coverage of that?  Took his girlfriend, raped her for days before cutting her tits off and killing her.  Fucking left-wing pussies.  Yeah, where's that?  Where is it?  But no, the news is full of the cat fucking kicking story.  Guilty white fruit.  You shouldn't kick animals.  Yeah, right, Opie?  I agree.  How'd you learn that?  Where's Chester? 
[03:09:00]  Where is my Chester?  Yo.  He went downstairs to say hello to Opie.  Opie was eating dinner while he was watching his basketball game.  And Chester went down and said, hi, I heard Chester scream a little.  And he came up and a few months later, he was dead.  Opie, what happens to Chester? 
[03:09:30]  Chester shits a fribble now.  It looks like a friendlies fribble.  That Chester is shitting.  Three kicks make a dead dog.  It wasn't a couple months later.  I mean.  What was wrong with the dog we had?  Kicking the liver?  It baked pretty good.  Liver cancer?  That fucking other dog.  What was Tiffany? 
[03:10:00]  What was the other one?  Tiff?  The little fucking pug nose thing?  Remember when you would take turns bopping it on the nose under the table back in the day?  I would.  What was the name of that little thing?  I can't remember the fucking name.  Tiffy, right?  Was it Tiffy?  Because that was Dawn's little Yorkie's name.  Oh.  Tiffy Toodles.  Tootly Toot.  Tiffany Tootly Toot.  You know how you flick something that's on a table?  Let's say there's a little crumb.  And you kind of get the power up with your pointer finger by flicking it off of your thumb.  It's very, you know. 
[03:10:30]  We would do that to the dog under the table so fucking hard.  I couldn't build up enough power in the finger to snap this dog in the nose.  This dog.  And it would go like.  And I'd be like.  Oh, oh, Chester.  I'm sorry.  I stepped on his foot by accident.  Oh, he'll be okay.  And it happened three more times during dinner.  Believe it or not, I love animals.  That thing was a night.  Here it is.  Try to eat.  Watch.  Okay, you're trying to eat. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Holy shit.  It would go on and on.  For the whole meal.  Chester's hungry.  For the whole meal.  Feed Chester poison.  It would climb on you.  It wasn't Chester.  That was Chester too, wasn't it?  Oh, but the replacement dog was way worse.  Way worse.  Stupid ass dog. 
[03:11:30]  stupid-ass everything.  Could you put a garage door opener  in my house during your vacation?  Yeah, okay, sounds like a treat.  I'll be out in a fucking Massachusetts cold.  Your ex-mother-law,  like, God bless her, I like her.  But she had a 50- to 100-foot phone cord.  Oh, well, the phone cord was  the reason you broke everything  in her fucking house, too.  Hope you'd talk on the phone  swinging a virtual wrecking ball 
[03:12:00]  from his hand.  This phone cord's wound up  in, like, balls that were tangles,  but the phone cord was long enough  to go everywhere  because it was, like, 60 feet long.  No joke, it was the longest  phone cord I ever saw,  and it's like, why don't you  have a fucking, like, a...  A codless!  A codless!  Codless!  And I like to wander around  when I talk on the phone.  So he's knocking hummels over,  they're breaking on the floor.  You broke some, like,  precious fucking thing.  She had precious moments,  and she didn't care. 
[03:12:30]  She loved Opie.  Forget about it.  Opie could do no fucking wrong.  That's okay.  I'll just glue the head back on.  I'll glue it back on.  What happened to my  Faberge egg?  I think Opie broke it.  The best is Smud from Whackbag.  Great.  Now I'm stuck in my car.  Judy rules.  Judy.  She did rule.  Judy.  Yeah, poor Judy passed.  I've passed on to the afterlife.  I've passed!  You liked her, though, right?  I'm with Annie Marg now! 
[03:13:00]  Fucking her and Annie Marg,  I'd have to take them out.  I'll bolt out for brunch or some shit.  Annie Marg loved to, like,  toss them back, though.  What's the bill?  Let's see.  All right, for the brunch,  it was $17.  and for the drinks,  $241.  What?  We had a couple of cocktails.  I had a mimosa,  Annie Marg was drinking  screwdrivers, 
[03:13:30]  and Jennifer was having  the Bloody Marys.  Okay, how many did you each have?  15!  Wow!  Oh, my God.  Yeah, those were the days.  By the way...  Annie Marg died.  Yeah.  Yeah, they all...  They all kept the one  you want to die.  I never said that.  I would never make a statement  such as that on the airway.  It's almost over, Jim.  No, no, I'm saying in life.  I'm not saying...  Exactly!  I'm saying it's always  the people you don't want. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, it's true.  Yeah.  You know,  they say,  only the good die young.  Who says that, though?  Billy Joel.  Yeah.  That's what I say.  Only the good...  Toodly-doo.  No, no, no, no, no.  Toodly-doo-doo-doo.  Toodly-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.  Toodly-doo-doo.  Is this a bonus  Toodly-doo song of the day?  Toodly-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. 
[03:14:30]  Toodly-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo 
[03:15:00]  All right, enough of the Billy Joel.  Thank you.  Toodly-doo-ly-doo.  Jim McSweeney says my argument of being a nice guy is falling apart.  Like this by your very eyes.  I'm a nice guy argument is really falling apart this morning.  I didn't claim to be a nice guy.  I'm just saying Anthony, you know, has been under the radar as far as that thing goes for one too long.  Hey, here's that guy.  He says he's famous for doing this on the fan.  Just to bring everyone up to speed. 
[03:15:30]  Right about the route.  Jack on the cell phone.  Jack, what's going on today?  Hey, Mike, I want to slap your butt cheeks.  Okay, I heard that from Jack on Saturday.  Here is nicely produced Mike and Yonkers.  Mike, what's going on today?  Hey, what's the slap my butt cheeks, Mikey?  People love the toodly-doo.  I love the toodly-doo songs.  One song a day, though.  You can just toodly-doo.  I'm sorry, I got a little overzealous with the Billy Joel.  I just feel like toodly-doing.  Toodly-toodly-doo. 
[03:16:00]  It's amazing how addicting it is.  It's a toodly-doo.  Because that's the sound I hear in my head when my balls are being sucked.  I hear like toodly-doodly-doo and doodly-doodly-doo.  I must acknowledge the fact that I did get the toodly-doodly-doo from Jim.  Doesn't matter.  The toodly-doos.  You know what?  I pulled it from space.  We're all toodly-doers deep down.  Yes.  I just adapted it to that stupid flute that that fucking homeless Indian was playing.  Great wolf.  Your balls are getting sucked.  Your balls are getting sucked.  And there's a finger being piped in that ear. 
[03:16:30]  Toodly-doodly-doo.  Toodly-doodly-dee-dee.  Guys, we got to do the George Brett thing from Friday.  We let the folks down.  We did.  George Brett talking about shitting in his pants, but there was a mic open.  Really?  Yes.  This is really good, actually.  We just didn't have time on Friday.  What were we doing on Friday?  I thought we were just kind of calling it in.  Yeah, we phoned it in.  All right.  Then, check how sick I was. 
[03:17:00]  Check how sick I was.  Then I'm standing up.  Yeah, wait, wait.  I think I might have got the tracks reversed.  Oh, Danny, no.  You did not watch.  Oh, my God.  Danny is so fired.  Is Danny leaving the show?  Wow.  Let me look at him.  Very interesting.  Oh, no.  Right side.  Back to the right, gentlemen.  Both hands.  Right side.  What's the setup on this, Danny? 
[03:17:30]  I need a little setup for the folks out there.  I'm not sure who was filming or why they were filming, but they were filming, I guess the  Royals doing their spring training exercises before a game.  And he was wearing a mic, and I guess he forgot it was on or didn't realize it was hot.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Didn't realize it was hot.  And he's just telling one of the rookies about how he got sick one day.  Nice.  Right side.  Back to the right, gentlemen. 
[03:18:00]  Both hands.  Right side.  Pardon.  To the left side.  I shit my pants last night.  I did.  Went out and had a great meal.  Just a great fucking meal.  I had to go to the bathroom so bad in the car.  I'm going, travel.  Hurry up, man.  I got to shit.  I had fucking shit in my pants.  And if you listen real closely, at the beginning, the way that he remembers this whole I shit  my pants story was because he farts and then turns to the guy.  He goes, I farted. 
[03:18:30]  I shit my pants.  He's got to be happy that this guy, that's hilarious.  He's really just, yeah, this is just some guy's story.  Talking about fucking, yeah, I shit my pants.  This is what guys talk about.  Yeah, fuck, I had a good meal.  This is why women are not fun to hang out with.  You chicks have never told a good I shit my pants story.  Fucking whores.  How great is it when a little nugget pops out?  Oh, it's not.  There's nothing better.  A nugget.  Just a little.  If you let a whole lot out. 
[03:19:00]  How about one of those?  It looks like someone broke a 20 ounce yu-hu on a rug.  That happened once.  I'm talking about a hard nugget that just popped out because of the force of the gas or something.  Here's the thing, though.  It's always either a nugget because you were trying to sneak a fart out.  Right.  Or you have such bad diarrhea that you can't hold it in and that splatters.  What about a nice, tapered, one foot long shit that you just decide to take in your pants?  How fucking funny would it be to have to walk around with like a pound of shit in your pants? 
[03:19:30]  Well, when it happened to me, you don't actually decide.  No, it's just it.  It starts out as a fart and you realize, oh, and at that point, yeah, you might as well.  All right.  Because you know you're throwing everything away anyway.  Shit your pants day.  Right.  We've got to have a shit your pants day on the show.  What you're missing is the beauty of making the decision to do it.  Yes.  Well, the bathroom's open.  No.  I don't feel like getting up.  I'm just shitting.  I'd rather just shit my pants.  Without even thinking about it for 20 seconds, I have four stories that I remember. 
[03:20:00]  Really?  Look, I don't want to be the only one, but I shit like a champ every day at, you know,  5.15.  Oh, 5.15.  I will hold it in and I will shit my pants, but I can't be the only one.  Here comes the old 5.15.  Right.  Poop, poop.  And then we'll have some...  Boop, boop.  I know.  And then we'll have...  And then we'll have someone judge who did the best shitting in their pants. 
[03:20:30]  The best shit in their pants.  I don't know if I could shit myself.  You know what the worst is?  Jimmy, could you, though?  Could you shit yourself?  Could I breathe?  No, would you, though?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  What do we wear?  Whatever you want.  The tuxedo.  Or a white tuxedo.  That's what we're going to do.  With tails.  To get a brown streak on.  Listen, here's what we ought to do for the radio show.  Okay.  We should all wear white tuxedos and go out to a restaurant and shit our pants in the white  tuxedos.  Listen, the whole fucking radio show should go out and shit our pants in white tuxedos 
[03:21:00]  with top hats.  Diuretically evacuate.  What the fuck are they going to do about it?  Throw us out?  You know how bad it would smell when the waiter came to the table and everyone's just got  loads of shit in their pants?  How about we don't even get to the table?  We all do it while we're waiting to be seated.  This way they can't accuse us of anything.  We all shit our white tuxedo pants.  Would you like to be seated now?  Oh my word. 
[03:21:30]  What is that smell?  They'd have to mop the floor and throw us all out and we'd all be standing on the bus  back to the city.  Because you don't want to sit.  Your table is ready if you would come this way.  Oh my.  In white tuxedos.  Fuck, that's hilarious.  Oh, hello.  Yes, um, yeah, hi, uh, table for five, please.  Yeah, sorry about that.  Yeah, I need a table. 
[03:22:00]  Oof.  Yeah.  Derek, Derek, they're noticing you're on the board today.  Wow.  See, it's not a waste of time.  That was a good pickup by Derek.  All right, let's get back to George Brett.  But I'll let, I'll let, I'll let a, I'll let a log out if someone else does.  Should I be honest right now?  I, I'm not going to shit, but the way I have gas, like, this could, if I could, like.  Oh.  All right, Jimmy, that was a good one. 
[03:22:30]  I, that could have been a problem.  Right.  But, uh, yeah, I got the.  That sounded like it is a problem.  Are you sure?  No, it's not.  No, I never.  My asshole's immaculate.  Well, that's good for you.  Embarrassingly clean.  Well, that's good for you.  It's fucking hairless.  That's wonderful, Jimmy.  There's not a person in this room that wouldn't want to tongue out my brown eye.  That's wonderful.  Oh.  All right.  Here's George Brett.  So the first part, you hear him, like.  Oh, someone's calling.  Who's calling, Jimmy? 
[03:23:00]  Oh, someone's going to be called a cunt real quick, though.  Yes?  Who?  Rich?  Get the fuck off the phone, you cunt asshole.  What's that?  Uh, Rich Hornack looking for Bob Meyer.  Oh, he is a cunt asshole, then.  And then he goes, all right.  I guess we heard you screaming.  All right.  All right.  He wasn't happy.  All right.  Let's go to the, uh, George Brett thing. 
[03:23:30]  He wasn't happy.  No, he wasn't.  Oops.  We got someone calling from Bethlehem.  Is it the baby Jesus?  I would believe that's Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  That's so Bethlehem.  It's baby Jesus.  Everyone has a shit story.  Fuck talking politics, right, everyone?  Yeah.  Let's talk shit.  They love their shit.  Here's George Brett.  Listen for the fart.  Right side.  Back to the right.  Both hands.  Right side.  Farted.  To the left side.  I shit my pants last night. 
[03:24:00]  I did.  Farted.  Went out and had a great meal.  Just a great fucking meal.  I had to go to the bathroom so bad in the car.  I'm going, travel.  Hurry up, man.  I got to shit.  I had fucking shit in my pants.  I'm good twice a year for that.  When was the last time you shit your pants?  Me?  Yeah.  Been a while?  It's been a while.  Shit.  I was in Vegas a couple years ago.  Just an honest, I got a true story.  Staying at the Bellagio.  Okay.  I went over to Mirage for dinner.  Met some friends of mine over there.  Went to Kokomo's, a great little steakhouse. 
[03:24:30]  The guy brings out some fresh crab legs.  He just came in.  I got to give them to you guys.  I'm eating them.  Then we go play gamble a little bit.  I had a tea time early in the morning.  So I said, look, I got to get going.  I'm walking back to the hotel.  I get three quarters of the way out of the lobby.  All of a sudden, I go, oh, fuck.  And I'm standing here like this.  I got my butt pinched so fucked.  I'm fucked.  I can't move.  All of a sudden, you know, felt all right.  I went just like this. 
[03:25:00]  Water.  I had some food poisoning from the crabs.  Take off my leather jacket.  Tied it around my waist.  I'm just standing there.  And it's just running down my leg.  I got jeans on, black bucks, no socks.  And I just start fucking walking.  Every time I'm walking, something's coming out.  It's water.  Straight fucking water.  Oh, God.  It's a Hall of Fame player.  No shit.  Telling his shit story.  Can I tell you my... 
[03:25:30]  It's a good one.  Wait, really fast before you move on, before we lose the moment.  That guy didn't want to hear the George Brett shitting his pants story.  Yeah, did you hear him?  He's like, eh, it's been a while.  But he forced the story on the guy.  He really wanted to tell him about the time he shit his pants.  George Brett could not wait to tell the story.  And during the whole course of George telling the story to these players,  they're like walking away from him and like he's following them.  There's a video?  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  Telling him.  Yeah, it was at the Bellagio.  Yeah. 
[03:26:00]  Having some crab legs.  Now I understand why he was carried on so much.  That wasn't pine tar.  Yeah.  Not on the back.  His own special.  Yeah, a special gription.  Can I tell you that...  Sorry, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  That's okay.  The best part of that whole thing was the way it literally went far to shit my pants.  He...  Can we hear the beginning again?  Because you've never heard a faster transition.  You're right, Dan.  He wanted to get into that shit that anything would have segued.  You got a Buick.  Shit my pants last night. 
[03:26:30]  Right.  That's right.  Yeah.  Right side.  Back to the right, gentlemen.  Both hands.  Right side.  How fast?  Pardon.  To the left side.  I shit my pants last night.  I did.  Went out and had a great meal.  Just a great fucking meal.  I had to go to the bathroom.  Who asked him?  I didn't know what happened to him.  He probably didn't even fart.  He just lied about it so he could say good to the story.  Wilmington Wow writes, no wonder George Brett had hemorrhoids.  George Brett shitting his fucking pants in the lobby. 
[03:27:00]  How helpless do you feel?  Oh my God, really?  Just like, hey.  And then when people come up, hey, George Brett.  Oh man, I want to shake his hand and he's...  This is another part of the story if you want to hear it.  Oh yeah, I have to.  On the down of the leg, of course.  Here we go.  God damn, I can't find it.  What happened?  I can't find it.  Then, just tell how sick I was.  Tell you how sick I was.  Then I'm standing outside and I got to get on my cell phone and I called a guy.  I said, Larry, you won't believe this.  I'm standing outside the fucking Bellagio. 
[03:27:30]  I can't move.  I got shit everywhere.  I shit all over myself.  And Larry's about a 48 waist.  So he brings me over a pair of pants and some towels and some towels.  And so then he comes over and he meets me.  I tell him where I'm standing.  He finds the closest bathroom.  When you go up the escalator, you go into the fucking...  I can't get in the elevator.  It's 12 o'clock at night.  So he goes in.  He finds the closest bathroom in the lobby of the hotel.  And then I get in the escalator.  And he kind of pretends like he dropped something. 
[03:28:00]  So no one gets behind me.  Tells me where it is.  I go in there.  He goes and gets the towel all wet for me.  Throws it over the fucking stall.  I take off all my fucking clothes.  Just wipe off.  Leave my shoes.  Left my shoes.  My pants.  Everything right there.  The towels right there in the stall.  And I'm walking barefoot with my shirt and his pants that are 48 waist through the lobby like this.  It's midnight.  Got up in the morning.  Took the most perfect double tapered shit I've ever had in my life.  Double tapered.  True story.  True story. 
[03:28:30]  Who's the pitchers in this game?  Back to business.  All I want to do...  I got to call Bravo Sierra.  What was he doing?  Some kind of prank?  He just casually goes, who are the pitchers today at the end of that?  Dude, he's just telling a story.  No, you know what it was?  He was telling a story.  And like the guys that he was telling the story to, they just didn't care or like they  were too...  They were embarrassed or whatever by it.  So, he was done with the story.  They were so uninterested.  He just had no one to turn to.  So, he just turned to someone else and was like, oh, who's the pitchers? 
[03:29:00]  That is fantastic.  That is fantastic.  I like the fact that there's a fucking Hall of Famer and you could have gotten his shitty  shoes and pants and put them on eBay.  All I want to do is hang out with George Brett and listen to his shit stories.  Shit stories from George Brett.  He says it happens twice a year, so he's probably got a lot of them.  Dude, how old is he?  50?  I think a hundred shit stories.  I would hear all of them twice.  Well, now that he's older, it's probably three or four times here at this point.  That's fantastic.  Because when you get older, you might shit your pants more. 
[03:29:30]  You can't find it?  Nah, it's been taken off of a few...  Why would it be?  Oh, really?  Yeah, I don't know why.  Oh, my God.  That is really good.  Farted.  Let's say hi to Bob in Pennsylvania.  Bob.  Hey, Bab.  Yeah.  Hey, Bob.  Call back.  Bob, it's just a story.  Bob, you're listening to the program, Bob, instead of your phone.  I give up on Bob. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, Jimmy, Jesus.  Jimmy's got some good ones in him today.  And then he giggles.  God, farting is wonderful.  God damn it.  I had to throw a pillow away this weekend.  Did you?  Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night.  Dude, it was.  Because there was a horrendous smell in my bed.  Oh, no.  And then I realized it was the pillow.  Somehow, I guess... 
[03:30:30]  I have a lot of pillows in my bed, and I guess I must have been, like, farting into my pillow  or something.  Yeah, what?  And the smell that came from this pillow woke us both up, by the way.  That is so fucking disgusting.  10-up, fart pillow?  How do you get fart pillows?  What do you put the pillow between your legs?  Well, I guess.  Do you sleep with a pillow between your legs?  Because some people say that's good for your back or some shit.  Yeah, because I'm dealing with a back issue right now.  And then you just fart into this fucking fluffy little pillow, this poor pillow. 
[03:31:00]  It woke us both up.  We're just both days confused, like, what the hell is that?  And then I smelled the pillow, and the pillow reeked.  Oh, God.  Why'd you throw it out instead of just washing it or washing it?  Well, I exaggerate.  I just threw the pillowcase away.  Look how close Alaska is to California, that map.  It's, like, right there, and Hawaii is off the coast of Texas.  You always show the map like that.  Queen City itself.  Geographically challenged.  Oil dips below $100. 
[03:31:30]  Nice.  Yeah, but meanwhile, there's still the John S. Q. Public is still paying at the pump.  Yeah, that's right.  They got us by the purse strings.  So did Obama win the debate?  That's what polls are showing.  Not the poll I read on Drudge, but I'm sure CNN poll would have him winning.  Fox would have McCain winning.  Because that's their audience.  That's who's voting.  Where do we go for fair and balanced news? 
[03:32:00]  Opie and Anthony show.  Well, we try.  I guess we're better than most.  No.  But then we have to talk about shit and stuff, so it kind of confuses everyone.  Yeah, it does.  We probably get really good knowledge out there, but no one wants to take us seriously because  we have all this other crap we do.  And then we talk about shit.  We had a really good religious discussion today, but now we're totally tooting and talking about  shitting our pants to get the ratings up.  That's what the satellite audience looks for.  Who calls themselves fair and balanced?  Fox.  Fox. 
[03:32:30]  They're not fair and balanced.  No.  That's the no spin zone.  The beauty is to go from CNN to Fox.  Any given night, it's two drastically different things going on.  Yeah.  They're covering the same story.  Amazing.  The debate.  And it's completely different.  Right.  Electoral votes shift Obama's way as he gains in Florida and some other state.  Look, McCain is really old and his vice president's a dumb twat.  How can anybody want McCain?  I mean, I know you like the guy, but I'm saying, practically, she could be fucking president. 
[03:33:00]  She is, I think, really bringing down the ticket now.  She stinks!  Now, I mean, at first, she boosted it up because it's like, all right, she's kind of a mom thing.  The moms are relating to her.  And like I said, she gave a pretty good speech when she was first appointed or nominated.  And then, holy shit, she's just an ass who knows nothing.  So what does McCain do, Anthony?  You're McCain guy.  She has to.  The only way you can replace her. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, big trouble.  This is big trouble for McCain.  Wow, this is breaking news from Anthony Cormia.  You didn't think this is big trouble.  You didn't think this last week.  No, no.  Now she's starting with these faux pas.  She's stupid.  She's a dummy.  She's what they call a dumb broad.  Yep.  She really isn't, um, not that worldly.  They got a video of her jogging in a Eagles jersey looking really hot.  What is she, in Philly today?  Really?  She doesn't fucking do interviews because she's a fucking dumb cluck.  Yeah. 
[03:34:00]  She's stupid.  She'll get killed in a debate.  Well, the debate is what, Thursday?  I can't wait to see that.  I'm not watching that.  Everyone's watching that.  That'll be one of the highest rated vice presidential debates.  But, dude, if Biden can make her look stupid.  That's easy.  Yeah.  She could just start crying.  Why are you being so mean to me?  Imagine she just turns complete bitch and just goes crying off.  You know, makes fun of his wife and kids being killed.  Oh.  She comments on that and he's like, yeah, well, look at you, pumped out.  They just get really nasty and pleasurable.  Really fucking nasty.  Yeah, nice hair plugs, douchebag. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah, good.  This might be getting too deep into the subject, but did anyone take a look at the debate Friday?  I didn't.  And how McCain started off?  I thought they were canceling it, to be honest with you.  McCain went for the heartstrings and he went for an open to get everyone on his side.  He didn't say reporting for duty?  He goes like this.  He goes, it was so calculated.  He's like, before I start, I just want to like, you know, my thoughts and prayers go  out to Edward Kennedy and his family.  He was rushed to the hospital just a few hours before this debate began. 
[03:35:00]  And my thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family.  It turns out, Kennedy had a minor, like a minor tremor or something.  Doesn't matter.  And he had to go to the hospital to be checked out.  Jeez.  But McCain was using it.  Fucking eggplant in your head.  But McCain was using this to like, to get everyone like, oh.  Any well-wishers, you want to say hi, just follow the trail of pudding to his room?  Oh, boy.  All fucking country's falling apart financially. 
[03:35:30]  Ted's had his day in the sun.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't hate Ted Kennedy, but it's like, you know, come on.  Yeah.  Let's move on.  Yeah.  Let's fucking move on, can we?  Those Kennedys in their brains.  I did not get pink eye from the farting into the pillow.  Brown eye.  It was awful, though.  Jason in Texas.  Let's do line of the day.  Get the hell out of here.  Jason.  Hey.  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  Better now, Jason. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, sweet, man.  It's my birthday.  Jason wasn't a very good swimmer.  Go ahead.  You're the only reason why I have XM radio.  Kill them, mommy.  Kill them, mommy.  How terrible overacting that was.  She was horrid.  Yeah.  Old broad.  Stupid sweater.  Mrs. Vorklitz.  Jason, what do you got?  I'm shocked.  I can't believe I actually made it on the show.  Yeah, you did.  Go ahead.  That was awesome.  Hey, what about anything in the prize chest for a faithful O&A listener?  Yeah, I got something for you. 
[03:36:30]  Exactly.  There it is.  Dial tone.  Let's see how did John in Washington.  Take it with you.  John.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  That other asshole you were just talking to.  What a moron.  Hey, I got a shit story for you.  I've been waiting, holding out for her.  Nice.  Used to have to take care of this retarded kid a couple hours a day at school, right?  The kid used to have a big thing about the bathroom.  So he says, I got to go to the guy.  So I said, okay, let's go to the bathroom.  Well, he'd already shit himself.  He's running down his leg.  I got to clean the kid up a little bit, right?  So we get in there.  I'm kind of trying to wipe his ass off, clean the shit off his leg. 
[03:37:00]  And I bend the kid over to wipe his backside, and he's got a frickin' looks like a little  mini alien brain sticking out of his ass.  It was his sphincter muscle.  It popped out.  Got to put it back.  Uncle Paul.  I called a frickin' idiot that's in charge of him all day, and I said, what the hell  is this?  And she barks at me, well, he knows how to take care of it.  And I said, what?  I said, Seth, she says, you know how to take care of it. 
[03:37:30]  I do, I do.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Crosses his legs, pinches his ass together, squeezes his little cheeks together, and pop,  it's gone.  Yep.  Holy shit.  Unbelievable.  He was supposed to have gotten surgery to correct this little malady, but that might  be one for that sick doctor you get on there.  He's like one of those kids who can turn his eyelids inside out.  One of those kids that can do that?  Yeah.  Yeah, walk around with meatball eyes.  They call it...  All right.  Whatever.  You're talking.  Most hideous thing in the world, honest to God.  Mm-hmm.  Thank you, John.  Let's go to Dave in Mississippi. 
[03:38:00]  He was at the debate on Friday.  No, he wasn't.  Dave, were you at the debate, or are you lying?  It's a cluck.  Yeah, I went to check it out down in Oxford last Friday night, and I don't know, I haven't  really noticed it before, but every time McCain talks, he has that speech impediment  with the S words.  It's like, he whistles every time.  Yeah, he does whistle.  He's got this whistling.  Yeah, it's that whistling thing, and he also resembles that cartoon, King of the Hill,  Hank Hill's dad, that fucking Vietnam amputee. 
[03:38:30]  Okay.  My girl picked up on the fact that McCain's upper lip doesn't move.  Anyone else notice that one yet?  Neither do his shoulders.  Yeah.  But his lip doesn't move at all, the upper lip.  It's kind of, it's a bit strange to look at.  Yeah, when an NVA boot is smashed into it, I guess all the nerves are kind of...  Let's go to Todd in West Virginia.  Todd.  Yeah, when McCain was talking about Kennedy being in the hospital, he had already been  home for an hour. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He was talking about John F. Kennedy.  He just seems so out of it.  Yes.  And he was shot, I think, 45 years ago in Dallas.  I think McCain goes out of his way to show everyone that he's a really nice guy.  Yeah.  I think we all know he's a good guy, but he seems to be trying to push that forward a little  too much when he talks publicly.  Ted Kennedy was rushed to the hospital with a brain aneurysm.  Our hats and prayers are with the guys. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yeah, no, sometimes it pops out.  It just grips the head so nice.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Something's happening.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  There's a little more to that than met the nose.  Oh, is it really stinking now?  I bet it is.  Comes off the microphone.  Bites me like a crab claw.  It's like I'm trying to smell something in a crab cage, and it's going, the old schnozzola. 
[03:40:00]  You know, a funny image, a crab just pinching someone's nose.  That is comedy gold.  Oh, look.  Yes.  Especially if they're fucking laid up, like paralyzed below the neck, and someone just  puts a crab on their chest, and they rub, like, whatever's in a crab vagina on your  nose, so the male crab will grab it and try to fuck your face. 
[03:40:30]  It's silly time on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's ridiculous.  Fucking awful.  Here to help us introduce silly time is the silliest goose we know, Mr. R. Bud Dwyer.  Don't metal down.  Don't, don't pat.  Oh, shit.  The nose.  Crab just clips his nose.  Found a friend, Harry.  Love that scene.  Creepshow. 
[03:41:00]  Creepshow, yes.  Buried up to his neck.  Leslie Nielsen buried Ted Danson up to his neck.  Do a line.  I'll tell you what it's from.  Oh, geez.  Now I'm stuck.  You can act like a man.  How about, um...  How about we do this?  Shut your head.  We may decide to do something that, that, that is different from Barack Obama, but we should 
[03:41:30]  decide that based on our self-interest and what we think is best.  Um, and the only way that will happen is that if people are paying attention and neighbors  are talking to neighbors and family members are talking to family members, people shouldn't  make a decision this time based on, I like that guy.  Or, you know, I, she's cute.  Um, you know, this isn't...  Who's that? 
[03:42:00]  Michelle.  Michelle.  Michelle?  Michelle Obama.  Good.  I like her.  I don't.  I don't.  Really?  At all.  You like Michelle Obama?  Why not?  Notice that...  I'm with Anthony on that one.  She scares me.  Notice her, uh, absence from his, uh, campaigning of late.  They buried her.  She was with him every fucking where he went at the beginning of this shindig.  The second he actually clinched the nomination, bye-bye.  Don't need her fucking, uh, input. 
[03:42:30]  Cause she is, uh, she's a troublemaker for him.  I make believe she doesn't exist.  Well.  Seriously, I do.  He gets elected.  She's gonna have a lot of say.  Believe me.  She's one of those sisters that looks like she don't take no shit.  No shit.  Guaranteed.  Guaranteed.  Yeah, Heather Locklear was arrested for, um, driving erratically.  They're not calling it a dewee yet.  They might be drug-oriented.  Yep.  Maybe even prescription.  Yep.  But, uh, her mugshot looked pretty good. 
[03:43:00]  She was all watery, cry-ey eyes.  Mm-hmm.  You know, she had big, uh, big doe eyes all full of water.  She looked pretty hot.  Just wanted to, yeah, he wanted to comfort her.  Yeah.  She still looks good.  She can't, she's definitely no kid.  Comfort her with a good fisting.  Anthony, you actually said that a 47-year-old woman looks good.  Well, she looks good.  I didn't say I'm fucking her.  Yeah, he wants to treat her mouth like a pocket pussy and then stab her.  Yeah.  I am a little pissed about the, uh, pocket pussy.  About what?  I am a little pissed, uh, that, uh, uh, uh, well, uh, who, who got married? 
[03:43:30]  Scarlett Johansson.  Yes, Scarlett Johansson married that fucking, uh, guy there.  Ryan.  Fucking Duncanook.  What's his name?  Ryan Reynolds.  Ryan Reynolds.  She is fucking beautiful.  So now she's off the market.  Yeah.  Have you had a shot, though?  Hey, I might have.  He probably did.  Never know.  I don't know in this fucking stupid business.  Yeah.  That fucking fat cock swings the right way.  Never fucking know.  Never know.  I don't want to have her in my closet.  Scarlett Johansson.  She was beautiful. 
[03:44:00]  She's fucking hot, man.  She's got nice boobies.  Dude, she has some fucking fat motherfucking tits and that beautiful face.  That juicy rump.  She's got really nice boobies.  But she's got a fat pussy, Jim.  She probably does.  She probably shaves it.  She probably didn't shave it because it was too meaty.  She's like, I can't.  It looks like a boxer's fist.  And someone said, trust me, that's good.  And she has to wear fucking old school bathing suits, like male bathing suits.  Because she probably said once, my cunt bulge is obscene.  And then she went. 
[03:44:30]  And then she's like, I can't even give head because I slobber so much.  Oh, God.  I look like a Komodo dragon.  Dude, I'd love to eat her ass.  That's terrible.  Fucking four foot shit.  Let's play what drugs.  Yeah, that's a mugshot.  Yeah, we're looking at a mugshot and holy mother.  The color picture looks way better than the one we've seen in the paper.  What does she moisturize her hair with?  Sand?  Fucking stringy-haired bitch.  Yeah, see.  Look at those eyes.  Her eyes are so huge.  She looks like one of those paintings with the sad little faces. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, the big eye?  Yeah, the big eye paintings with the sad little faces.  But she's definitely got lip work done.  You can see she's got collagen lip thing going on.  Hopefully like Sean Connery.  Yeah, hair's a little a mess, isn't it?  But those are pretty sparkly.  Oh, my God.  Fresh tears.  We didn't even acknowledge that the Dow was down 262 more points today? 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, it went up 200 and something points on fucking Friday.  It's a rollercoaster ride you can make a lot of money on if you play it right.  I still got to get my money out of WAMO.  Fuck.  You have money in WAMO?  Oh, boy, do I.  Ah, Jesus.  Oh, boy, do I.  You better not really.  I do.  What happens?  Do you?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  They're going to just fucking freeze your assets.  No.  So they can pay their bills with it, and then you get nothing.  You're FDIC insured up to like 200,000 after that. 
[03:46:00]  It's all theirs.  So what do I do if my bank collapses?  I lose all my money?  If you have more than 200,000 in there, you'll just get 200,000.  No.  That's it.  So why would you ever keep more than that in a bank account?  You're not supposed to.  You're supposed to have it kind of broken up.  But that's the only way to make real interest.  Well, you could put it in different accounts.  No, but you don't get the same interest.  Each account is...  It's all based on the lump sum.  Or is it? 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, but if you're talking about a money market account, things like that,  some of those things are not FDIC insured.  Ah.  Yeah.  So what do I do?  Along with mutual funds and bonds.  Those aren't insured.  Those are you lose them.  You lose them.  I'm taking all my money out of banks today.  Consider it like Citadel stock.  Just a piece of shit.  I'm taking it all out today.  Put it in the bank of mattress.  The bank of mattress.  Bank of mattress.  Secure bank. 
[03:47:00]  This is professional broadcasting fucking...  I gotta go make a tinkle and then I gotta go because I gotta be somewhere.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy, where are you going with?  I got that lunch at 12.30 for Bill Maher's thing.  Oh, look who's invited.  Am I invited?  Ah, no.  Is Bill Maher gonna be there?  Why did you get invited?  Why the fuck?  Tell him to get on our fucking show.  Tell him we're pushing his movie night.  Yeah, I didn't get invited through them.  I got invited through the people.  I kind of like Bill Maher these days.  I've always liked Bill Maher.  He's a fucking very good comic.  Yeah, we just...  We got off on the wrong foot fucking 13 years ago.  He comes off like that.  He's not... 
[03:47:30]  I mean, I don't know him well.  I've known him one time.  I don't know him.  He knew Ant and I were green at the time and he pointed out and made us feel like douches.  And I think that's the reason why we make everyone look like a dick now.  Yeah, it's Bill Maher's fault.  Yep.  Fucker.  All right, why don't we do line of the day in the United States?  Line of the day.  Let's do that then.  Let's go.  Line of the day is brought to you by WebEx.  Really?  Wow.  New advertiser.  Nice.  WebEx.  WebEx.  WebEx.  Hold meetings, make presentations.  WebEx.  And do it from the comfort of your own home or office. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, I thought it was like X-rated.  Do you listen to fine-tuning?  Fine-tuning?  Never.  Anyone?  Why would I listen to that?  I like the fine-tuning on a Saturday or Sunday morning.  What is it?  Music from around the world.  But they go deep with the rock and roll, too.  Like, they'll play some obscure Van Morrison song.  I need hits.  And then some weird, like, African chant thing.  And then they'll go old school with some kind of, like,  like, kind of loungy fucking female singer thing.  Fucking weird. 
[03:48:30]  Why would you, uh...  Early morning.  And then they did, like, Walking on the Moon by the Police.  All mixed, uh, mumbo-jumbo.  Mumbo-jumbo stuff.  And then I think I heard Robert Plant doing, like, a Hendrix song.  Ugh.  Yeah.  I'm all about fucking either lithium...  You're all about the hits.  Lithium or, uh...  Or, uh...  Well, that's all I put on.  Lithium.  Well, my favorite...  I get the same ten songs over and over again.  My favorite station is either Ethel or Squiz,  but the problem is, yeah,  you gotta, like, rest those channels.  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  And let them get some new shit on there.  Mm-hmm.  And then you go back to it.  But decades...  Sometimes I like throwing on, uh, 80s.  Laugh along with some of the...  Yeah.  ...80s hits.  Guilty Pleasures.  80s?  Yeah.  What?  Well, when you...  Guilty Pleasures?  No.  When you get past the hair bands and, like, some of the...  Uh, New Wave?  Yeah.  There was some...  There was a lot of shit that was shoved down our throats in the 80s.  Yeah, but, you know, I'll listen to, um... 
[03:49:30]  How about Big Band?  What is Big Band channel?  Big Band?  Not Big Band.  You mean, like, Benny Goodman?  No, no, no, no, uh...  The fucking...  Uh...  Stupid instrument you have.  Uh...  Play it through your ass, then I'll be impressed.  It's like the...  The, uh...  Uh...  What is the channel?  Top tracks?  It's...  Big tracks?  Big tracks?  Yeah.  Big tracks is kind of cool.  Yeah, I listen to that.  All right. 
[03:50:00]  There's our advertisement for, um...  Satellite Radio.  Satellite.  For other channels.  We'd appreciate a little, uh...  You know, reciprocation on those channels to mention how our show is great.  Thank you.  Hoping for the best.  Hoping for the best.  Ah, you gotta hope for the best.  Expect the worst.  Hope for the best.  XM hit us.  We're hoping, uh, this new company doesn't hide us.  Oh, I thought you mean hit us.  Well, they did hit us.  You know how... 
[03:50:30]  You know how bad they wanted to hit us?  Down there in Washington?  Wanted to hide us?  Or hit us?  Both.  Okay.  What?  How did we skate and everyone else gets fired?  You see the list of people that are getting fired?  Are they on-air people?  Getting fired?  All those guys of power are gone.  Yeah, but...  Hugh, Nate.  Remember we sat with Nate?  He's long gone now.  Nope.  I don't remember because he didn't want to meet with me.  Fucking beat it.  Yeah.  I'm so glad he's gone.  I'm so fucking happy both of them are gone. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  Oof.  Nate.  Who's left down there?  Way to take the fucking...  Way to take the reins and drive it right to the ground.  Yeah.  Were they fucking Air Egypt pilots?  Big tracks.  Thank you.  Yeah.  People aren't happy with the ACDC channel because it took...  What station?  I don't know.  One I didn't listen to.  Broadway.  In the punk channel.  I know.  What was it called?  Fungus, they took it off.  I gotta go, guys.  All right, Jimmy. 
[03:51:30]  I'll see you tomorrow morning.  All right, James.  I gotta go home and take a nice shit.  Jimmy, did you get to see Religious today?  Or you just...  No, that was why I fucked up yesterday and didn't go to the screening because I, for some  reason, was thinking that it was today with the lunch.  I just misunderstood.  That sucks.  I'll go see it this week.  Because that movie's gonna be a biggie.  Yeah, I'll see it.  I mean, I'll listen to it when I'm talking.  We gotta get Mr. Donahue on tomorrow to talk about Religious.  No, we'd love to.  All right, line of the day.  We're just babbling.  Yeah, let's get out of here.  WebEx, yes.  Hold meetings, make presentations. 
[03:52:00]  Who are they kidding?  Wow, from the comfort of your home or office?  But that's how they're selling it?  No one buys this stuff for...  Yes, it's for meetings.  Yes, for conferences and meetings.  Why don't they tell the folks what they can really do with this WebEx if they want to  sell some stuff?  You know something?  Some cameras.  If anyone wants to use their very good software for other things besides just meetings, it  says hold meetings, make presentations.  You can do other things, but I think WebEx wants you to know that that is the option 
[03:52:30]  that is open to you.  Ixnay.  I love the guy.  Well, we got a webcam, so you kids can talk to grandma in Florida.  The second you hear webcam, it's all over.  Right.  Right.  The second the word webcam comes into a conversation.  Do you know why we get a webcam?  Well, so little Johnny and Susie could talk to grandma in Florida.  You know, they missed their grandma something terrible.  That's why I got this webcam. 
[03:53:00]  I'm going to be working a little late on Quicken tonight, honey.  You go to bed.  I got to balance our checking account.  That's when the webcam fires up.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Just spanking.  Well, they don't say what kind of presentations you can make, so that's entirely up to you.  Good point.  Look, God blesses WebEx, and I know it's some fine advertising they're doing, but I just laugh 
[03:53:30]  when they sell webcams to keep in contact with relatives across America.  America.  Hi, boss.  Mac Fry.  No.  Rumor has it, thanks to Bill K. from Philly, fuck the Phillies, although I am rooting for  them to go all the way, because it is my second home.  Sorry about that, Philly.  Donahue won't even watch the fucking movie, that blank bag.  Oh, there you go.  That jizz bag. 
[03:54:00]  Why don't we watch it?  We should at least watch it, right?  Lithium isn't that good of a channel, by the way.  I like lithium.  Fucking Alice in Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Soundgarden,  Alice in Chains, Nirvana.  Jesus Christ.  It's like Lucy.  Lucy is like everything we played at AF, which is pretty cool.  Where were we with the WebEx plug?  Do it from the comfort of your home.  I think we were there.  Check it out at WebEx.com, so you can do meetings. 
[03:54:30]  Meetings.  My cock meets your pussy.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Remember Chaka?  He was the cutest thing.  Was he?  Yeah.  How great would it be if a Bic lighter and Chaka?  Just to see him running around like a monk.  Yeah, they were all...  A protester.  It was so nice to him, and he was supposed to be all cutesy, but you know with all that  fur, and he didn't have toilet paper.  It's just a mess back there, like a bear. 
[03:55:00]  It looked like he was lugging around a bunch of coconuts.  Why does Chaka always have a coconut seat with him?  Jesus.  Very nice.  Jimmy sure can paint a picture, can he?  Me, me.  Toodley do tomorrow?  Well, if I feel like a toodley doodley do.  If there's a good toodley do song.  Or maybe a toodley do song that has something to do with what's going on tomorrow.  That's always good.  Tie it into a current event. 
[03:55:30]  Toodley do.  Yeah.  Another runner-up line of the day.  And then I couldn't find Slapshot anywhere.  I thought I had a copy.  Well, you gotta pick up the Paul Newman box set.  They have all those?  Well, it's at the Hollywood Funeral Home.  Jesus.  Whoa!  Whoa!  His pine box set.  Comes with a little satin pillow in it.  All the movies are resting gently on it.  That was in bad taste, wasn't it?  Too soon.  Just a bit.  Iraq, they're requesting Bob Marley's crapping instead of jamming. 
[03:56:00]  Justin Metz.  From Hoboken.  In honor of the shit stories we did today.  Meetings.  Ron R writes, meetings.  M-E-A-T-I-N-G-S.  A lot of the day time.  And thank you, Webex.com.  Here comes. 
[03:56:30]  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Well, I think why everyone's calling is Howard Johnson's the hitting coach.  So that's why he's wearing this uniform.  Jesus Christ.  Travis goes, that's why they're all calling.  And here I am going, cuckoo, cuckoo.  I shit my pants last night. 
[03:57:00]  The tag is good, but I think they got to keep the farted in there as well.  Yeah.  Farted.  Farted.  I shit my pants last night.  I kind of missed the roll.  I got to replay that, too.  All right.  I guess we're done.  Yep.  Let's mosey, as they say.  Mosey.  Another one in the books.  Good.  That Monday's done with.  Tomorrow's our last day.  We have some special plan. 
[03:57:30]  We'll see you tomorrow. </pre>
