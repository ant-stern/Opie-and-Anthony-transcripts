<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show returned from a two-week holiday break with Opie and Anthony recounting their struggles readjusting to their morning routine.  Anthony jokingly claimed he spent the break "partying and partying," while Opie described his morning disorientation.  They discussed the Mayan end-of-the-world prophecy, their sports teams (Jets, Giants, Islanders), and *The Honeymooners*.  Their New Year's Eve commentary heavily criticized CeeLo Green's altered lyrics to "Imagine," Justin Bieber's "Let It Be" performance with Carlos Santana (with a caller providing the fact that Greg Rolie, Santana's former keyboard player and "Black Magic Woman" singer, later joined Journey, and further discussion revealing Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac originally wrote it), and Dick Clark's seemingly pre-recorded appearance on *Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve*.  They also debated Santana's musicianship and a Van Halen rumor of a performance at Cafe Wha?.  The Bieber performance and his collaborations were discussed further.

A substantial portion focused on Van Halen's reunion, with a new song being played and a heated debate on David Lee Roth versus Sammy Hagar, heavily criticizing Roth's stage presence and discussing Michael Anthony's absence.  Axl Rose and Guns N' Roses were criticized, and a confusing, humorous discussion about Van Halen's best-selling albums ensued.  A shocking, albeit joking, anecdote about Ozzy Osbourne hanging a midget (revealed to be a long-running joke about Ronnie James Dio) was shared.  The show then transitioned to listener calls, with one focusing on a disgustingly cheap woman from "Extreme Cheapskates" who reuses toilet paper.  This led to a discussion about "Hoarders," specifically an episode involving a hoarder with a deceased person in their home.  The hosts expressed disgust and discussed the mental health aspects of hoarding. The segment concluded with self-promotion of their podcasts and projects, including a video podcast featuring Opie's new beard.  Profane and vulgar language was frequently used throughout.

The next segment began with promotion of side projects, including YouTube videos with Joe DeRosa, followed by a dismissive rant about their small online critics and a rant about portrait-mode videos.  A significant portion focused on a running joke regarding the death of frequent caller "Bobo" and the subsequent appearance of numerous impersonators.  MSNBC was cited as a source for Bobo's supposed death, with the hosts initially reacting with a mixture of mockery and sadness.  A voicemail from a purported "Bobo" claiming to be alive caused further chaos, escalating into a comedic segment with many callers claiming to be Bobo.  The prank included someone tricking Bobo into waiting outside for a Giants game that never arrived.  His relationship with his boyfriend, Kurt Love, was discussed. The segment also mentioned Dio Hughley, Joel McHale, Jim Jefferies, Jimmy Fallon, Carol Miller, and further discussion on Dick Clark's health and Ryan Seacrest's role in *Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve*.  Jimmy's flatulence was repeatedly referenced.  Vulgar language and offensive jokes were prevalent.

The following segment heavily criticized Ryan Seacrest's hosting of Dick Clark's New Year's Eve show, mocking his perceived inauthentic portrayal of Clark's health.  They imagined alternative scenarios involving B.B. King.  A *Twilight Zone* episode ("the man on the wing") was analyzed, focusing on the costume and lack of racial diversity.  Listener tweets were read, followed by commentary on Lady Gaga and Kathy Griffin's New Year's Eve performances.  The misidentification of John Walsh was discussed, alongside Brock Lesnar's UFC fight and retirement, and Mel Gibson's divorce.  A Katy Perry nude photo (or alleged photo) was examined with Sam Roberts' assistance.  William H. Macy's presence in the studio was mentioned, and the segment concluded with banter, including an account of Jim Norton's pungent flatulence.

The final excerpt opened with a discussion of Jim Norton's flatulence and its effects on the studio.  Anecdotes about Jim's bowel habits were shared, and Opie's new beard was compared to Yukon Cornelius.  The hosts discussed readjusting to their work schedule after vacation, with Ant's disheveled routine and Eric's sleeplessness and late-night texting with Opie mentioned. A call from "UCB Fred," a Ron and Fez intern, announced their return.  The crew's varying weights were joked about, with Roland, a guest, discussing his status as the number one son in his family compared to his brother Roger.  A listener won a copy of *Archer*.  A&E reality shows like *Intervention* and *Extreme Cheapskates*, and their authenticity, were discussed.  The show concluded with promotions for Opie and Anthony, Ron and Fez, Sam's podcast, and their social media.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  You get a dang open hand, you don't listen to a dang open hand.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  And now, here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons? I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  What does this thing do? 
[00:01:00]  What does this thing do?  Hello?  Are you talking to this end?  What happens?  You were...  Wow.  All right.  Oh boy, everybody's fucked up.  No, I'm going to try not to.  What?  Shut up, Sam.  It's a new year, so my new year's resolution is to not give a shit.  But the problem is, does it sound weird in your headphones? 
[00:01:30]  No, no.  It sounds a little weird.  It was a little loud at first.  A little loud.  But now it's okay.  Really?  Yeah.  Nah, Mars can figure it out.  No, we can't.  It sounds very bassy.  Bassy.  Bassy.  Damn.  No, you said something that was right on point right before the show.  Oh.  We only took two weeks off.  Maybe a little less, even.  I don't even know.  Yeah, it was like two weeks ago.  And then you wake up this morning, and I don't even know how to do this.  I was so discombobulated. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, radio.  I don't know how to do this.  I didn't know how to get ready for work.  Yeah.  Like, I got up.  First of all, I didn't know how to shut my alarm off.  I was still all groggy, and I'm just like, eh.  And then just the ritual that becomes automatic of just putting your pants on and getting dressed  and knowing where to go first, second, third, to get out of the house.  I was walking around like an idiot with one sock on and a toothbrush in my mouth.  Like, what do I do?  I don't know how to do this.  It only takes two weeks to completely forget that you ever did morning radio. 
[00:02:30]  My wife goes, when you walk away, you're really going to miss it.  Nah, I don't think so.  The two weeks reminded me, nah, I don't think you're going to miss it too much.  That was just nice to...  Weren't you bored, though?  I was bored.  Nah.  You should get a kid in your life.  Oh, maybe.  Or a girlfriend or a friend.  How about you start with a friend in your life?  Yeah, it was just one of those, you know, things where you're able to sleep a little 
[00:03:00]  later and stay up a little later.  You know, just do some shit.  Not have to worry about fucking down the hall people.  Down the hall people?  That's great.  Who are they?  I know.  Who are they?  It was fun.  Yeah, well...  And then the whole Christmas, New Year's thing is just kind of nice and being off that  whole time.  Parties, things like that.  It's just kind of fun.  Party and party and party and party and party and party and party and party and...  I guess we've got to say Happy New Year to everybody. 
[00:03:30]  Happy...  Due Year, actually.  Happy Due Year.  2012, if those Mayans are right, won't have to worry about decorating the old tree next year.  No one's going to listen to us.  Michukaku said they're not right on this very program.  We should get that clip.  Was he scared when he said it?  Can we get that clip?  I want it out there to the press that this 2012 shit is bullshit.  When in 2012?  When in 2012?  December 20th is the last day of the world.  Oh, they said December 20th? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, the whole year's got to go by first?  Yeah, that's what sucks.  Well, at least we get a summer in.  Yeah, I guess.  Nice.  So then how about October?  Could open the pool again.  How about October 20th would be nice?  I probably shouldn't close the pool.  Huh?  Nah.  Why bother?  Why bother?  Just let it turn green and...  Let everything rot.  Fuck.  Me and Jimmy were just talking about our fucking football teams.  Oh, what happened?  The Jets sat out.  I don't know.  My Giants won.  My Giants, huh? 
[00:04:30]  I don't have a sports team to follow right now.  Jimmy doesn't have a sports team to follow.  My Islanders suck a dick.  And my Jets are out of the playoffs.  Yeah.  And people are like, well, why don't you root for the Giants?  I'm not that guy.  No?  No!  Fuck the Giants.  If the Giants...  I'll be looking at the Giants, I think.  That's because you're not really a fan...  I'm not really a football fan.  ...of the Jets or the Giants.  Yeah.  No.  I hope the Giants lose first round.  I was...  As a matter of fact, I was watching the Honeymooners Marathon at some point, and a football game 
[00:05:00]  was on, and some guy tweets, weren't you watching the game, faggot?  And it's like, you know, I'm just...  I'm not that into football, and it's the Honeymooners.  And I don't...  And just...  It's a fucking bonehead.  I'm a faggot.  I understand not watching football on a regular Sunday, but, you know, it was the last week  of the season.  A lot of shit was going on.  Yeah.  A lot of maneuvering.  It doesn't even really...  No?  No.  I was watching a little of the Honeymooners. 
[00:05:30]  Man, he gets angry very easily.  Yeah, I was just telling you how threats of domestic violence on every episode is hilarious.  I saw the episode where, I don't know, some broad was sleeping over, and that just bothered  him.  Everything bothers him.  Just everything bothers him.  And you listen to me.  Right.  I was, like, yelling at people.  Holy shit.  I love when he would flub a line.  Who would live with that?  When he would flub a line and just plow over it because there was a live millions of people  watching, they couldn't...  Yeah.  They couldn't.  There was no cut.  No. 
[00:06:00]  Fantastic.  I love those marathons around New Year's Eve.  Adam's saying, why not follow the Knicks?  I have to follow the Knicks because I need sports in my life.  Oh, that's good.  Just a little bit.  So do you have...  I need sports in my life.  I don't have a hockey team.  I don't have a football team right now, so...  That's good.  So you got Time Warner?  Yeah, that's the problem.  Oh, so you could follow the...  Oh, that's right.  What?  You can't.  MSG.  I don't get MSG.  Said, yeah, them and Time Warner having an issue.  Wait, you can't see the Knicks on Time Warner?  No.  In New York City.  No.  This whole fucking thing is so fucking sickening. 
[00:06:30]  Let me explain, though.  I live probably two miles from where the Knicks play basketball, and I'm not allowed to watch  them.  You're not allowed.  Sorry, you can't come.  Oh, these fucking cable companies.  And the teams, too.  But they are all just such...  The whole thing.  Greedy.  They're all shit.  Scumbags.  Yeah, that's right.  I can't watch the Knicks.  So even though I want to...  Here's a guy that will be a Knicks fan, because I don't have my Islanders, I don't have my  Jets.  So, all right, I'll take a look at the Knicks. 
[00:07:00]  I can't watch the Knicks.  Nope.  I think if I go to Jersey, maybe I could watch.  Yeah.  Yeah, I have to go somewhere else to watch, even though I live two miles from where they  play.  Or I think...  Yeah, Fios just got MSG, right?  Huh?  Yeah, Fios.  Can I explain to JD, he goes, with all due respect, Ralph Crandon reminds you of yourself.  No, not even close.  I'm only uptight here.  I am so fucking chill when I'm out of this fucking building.  Simple as that. 
[00:07:30]  I'm a chill motherfucker.  That's it.  It's these assholes down the hall that drive me nuts.  But besides that, my life is fucking smooth.  Smooth.  Smooth.  Smooth, yo.  I never raise my voice.  I never raise my fist.  You're a fine host.  I'm a fine host.  Mine host.  Jimmy came over for a little New Year's because he was in town.  Nice.  Yes.  I don't want to drive New Year's Eve.  It scares me, man.  It's like, it's just tonight you're going to get killed.  No one wants to get paralyzed on New Year's Eve.  Oh, you don't want to be that guy. 
[00:08:00]  God, no.  You don't want to have to explain that as you're in your wheelchair blowing through a straw.  What happened?  Well, you know.  Figured I would have a few on New Year's Eve and drive home.  Yeah.  One for the road.  Right.  One for the road, indeed.  But usually it's the drunks that are cool, man.  They're the ones that don't get hurt.  Yeah, it's the other ones.  I ever tell you about the drunk driving accident that fucking hit our house when I was growing  up?  Hit your house?  You know where I live.  Yeah.  And my house that I grew up on, there was a turn and the drunks would come home from 
[00:08:30]  Huntington and they would go right into the woods because of the turn.  They're driving straight.  They're falling asleep, sleep, whatever.  And they go right in the woods and no problems.  Yeah.  They would just either kill themselves or destroy their cars and no one was bothered by this.  But the stupid fucking town decides, wow, too many people are going in the woods right  there.  We need a guardrail.  Oh, great.  So that meant that they hit the guardrail and then go right toward our fucking house. 
[00:09:00]  Ricochet off of that into your house.  Wonderful.  I could get my brothers on the phone.  I know of it of at least four horrific accidents that happened right in front of my fucking  house.  Okay.  One where the car's upside down in the middle of the night.  We hear help me, help me, help me.  My dad goes out there.  The car's upside down with a fucking electric wire on top.  I'm not going to be helping you.  No.  Well, he did though.  He dragged the guy out of the car.  Called the authorities. 
[00:09:30]  But one one guy hit our house.  They estimated he was going 80 miles an hour, hit the fucking corner, took out the whole  right side of our house while we're sleeping in the middle of the night.  The car rolled all the way into the backyard.  You couldn't even find a big piece of the car.  Yeah.  And because the guy was drunk, he walked away.  Did he get out singing Just the Way You Are?  Yeah.  Billy Joel.  Nice.  But with that accident, the guy was coming back from Huntington Hospital where his friend 
[00:10:00]  earlier that night was in a drunk driving accident.  They could talk about things.  And then he checked him out, got drunk, I guess, and then plowed into our house.  Oh, fantastic.  Do you know, you talk about drunk driving.  There's an amazing documentary on that woman.  Oh, yeah.  The drunk driving accident on the, where was it?  Was it?  Taconic.  Yeah, yeah.  Where she killed herself and her daughter and three nieces.  Yeah.  And three people, another, eight people died.  Yeah, crazy.  HBO did a documentary on her and how the family, the husband just thinks that she wasn't drunk. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  And it's amazing how good this thing is.  Is she drunk?  I think she was.  Oh, yeah.  Well, the toxicology reports say yes.  And they had them done by somebody else and they say yes.  And the husband's going, no, no, she wouldn't have done that if they found marijuana in her  system.  Yeah.  And he's, he's hateable.  By the end of it, you stop having empathy for him and going, ah, you know.  Yeah.  Guys just, he doesn't want to picture his wife as a murderer.  Sure.  And they're just like, ugh, shut up.  Yeah, by the end of it, I hated him.  You know, that shit before I had a kid was just another dumb story. 
[00:11:00]  But now I think, how the fuck do I allow my kid to go in someone else's car?  Like someone, let's say it's a parent of his friend when he gets a little older and all  of a sudden they're like, yeah, we're going to, you know, drive upstate, whatever.  We'll have it back Sunday.  I can't imagine that.  That you have to rely on somebody else.  You just got to roll them bones.  Yeah, I know.  It's just that everything's a chance.  Well, this was a family and she was like the responsible one and everybody thought  that she was like the one.  Nobody would never do that.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  She was the one you would say, oh my God, would I absolutely let my kids go? 
[00:11:30]  Designated driver.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  It was the morning.  It was early, you know?  Eek.  So, uh.  Something happened.  What happened to your kale boys?  That's what I was getting at.  Man, they stink and good.  Fuck them.  I left that invested in it, to be honest with you.  No, you became a fan at the end of the season.  Very briefly.  You started looking a little more.  Once I start watching, I'm like, eh.  But, uh, I just, I lose interest quickly.  Like, I was doing something else while they were on.  I don't really care.  I don't respect the franchise.  I don't, you know, fuck them.  I was annoyed for a minute. 
[00:12:00]  Eh.  And the dumb Jets.  Fuck them.  For a minute.  Yeah, who cares?  The dumb, stupid Jets.  I've been getting abused for a few days now on the old Twitter.  Yeah.  Because of the stupid fucking Jets and they're beating me up over Rex Ryan.  I don't play for the team.  I'm just a fucking fan.  But, yeah, apparently, uh, they kind of fell apart there.  Apparently?  You have to beat the Dolphins to, you know, kind of try to get into the playoffs and you can't do that?  No go. 
[00:12:30]  Then you got a quarterback that throws two interceptions to linemen?  Has that ever happened?  I know every once in a while you get the one interception, but.  Yeah.  Twice in one game?  Well, I guess you don't have to worry about seeing that anymore, huh?  Nah, me and Jimmy kind of have similar quarterbacks.  Sanchez and Romo are fundamentally really good quarterbacks, but they just fucking can't get it done when it matters.  Nah.  They're bums.  They're.  That.  What they do on the field would be like me doing stand up well in a club. 
[00:13:00]  And then every time I do TV, I fucking bomb.  Yeah.  That's what the equivalent is.  Every time I go out and go, ah, I would just have a horrible set and I would blame it on something else.  I saw the lights were in my face.  It was terrible.  I knew what to do with, ah, they didn't introduce me right.  Yeah.  They stink under pressure.  And I hate guys that stink under pressure.  Yeah, the choke artists.  I hate guys like that.  Ah, what are you going to do?  Because that's what's supposed to make you a champion is being able to, you know, bring 
[00:13:30]  that extra oomph when it matters.  Any job.  Can you imagine if a doctor stunk under pressure?  Like, he's really great.  Like, when there's no pressure, he has to sew up something at home.  Like, he's fucking great on the sewing machine, but then when he does stitches, he leaves it  open and there's an infection.  He's really great at concentration, but when it's, yeah, a real operation, he panics.  He just can't deal.  He doesn't know what he's doing.  Like, yeah, Sanchez sucked a big dick.  Yep, that's coming in from everyone.  Fuck.  Fuck.  I have no fucking football team. 
[00:14:00]  Eh.  Go 49ers.  I'm going with the 40 fucking Niners to win the whole goddamn thing.  I won't think about that worthless sport until next year.  Like, Super Bowl Sunday, I'll think about it because we won't be able to say anything  but the big game.  The big game.  I just don't give a shit.  I mean, it's weird how, like, I've changed over the years.  The more of these guys that we've met and the less I realize, it sounds corny, but I  have virtually no connection to most of them.  Yeah.  Not that they're supposed to love us, but I was like, I wound up disliking a lot of them. 
[00:14:30]  I'm like, I just don't have interest.  Yeah, most of them are jackass.  Tom Brady is one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever live, and I met him, and I hated him.  Very briefly.  But he's a dick.  How did you know you hated him by just meeting him briefly?  It's all in the face.  I always know because I've met enough, I'm lucky enough, and I've said this before, we're  all lucky enough to be on the side of, we're fans, so we're not so jaded that we wouldn't  ask for a picture.  Right.  But I also have fans, and I kind of understand how you react.  Most fans, when you walk up to somebody, you don't understand how you would react to that 
[00:15:00]  situation because people don't really approach you.  But I know what's annoying and what's not.  And I know what a quick handshake in a picture is okay.  You're just hanging out, having a beer, you're not doing anything crazy.  Is it ever annoying to meet a fan?  I think it's great.  Well, maybe once in every blue moon is one that can be annoying.  I've had times where I was like at the cellar where guys will walk up to me and just in  the middle of dinner, I'm like, all right.  But I always do it.  But someone like you meeting Brady, you're not in an annoying position, I guess. 
[00:15:30]  You know what I mean?  You know what not to do to be fucking annoying.  I shouldn't say he was a dick.  You know what?  Maybe I'm being unfair.  But I knew he was like, ugh.  But in fairness, he did take the picture.  But why was he bothered?  I don't know.  How could he be bothered?  The guys with him were dicks.  You know what?  Let me take that back because I got to be honest.  He wasn't that bad.  But the guys with him were kind of dicks.  His minion?  Yeah.  They were dicks.  Henchmen?  He was okay.  Well, that's their job, though.  Their job is to just be dicks. 
[00:16:00]  They're hanging with Brady.  It's like, well, you're hanging with him.  You're not him.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's their job.  So he doesn't look like a dick.  Oh, maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe it would annoy me.  Look, you know what?  I'm just backtracking over everything I just said.  Maybe it would annoy me if I always had people asking me to sign, like, Alan Alda doesn't  sign MASH stuff anymore because he's been doing it for 35 years.  Sign the fucking thing.  Just keep signing.  Maybe you get sick of it after 30 years of people interrupting your meals.  MASH stuff.  Jimmy.  You're a star. 
[00:16:30]  Yes, thank you.  Of MASH.  Oh, fuck.  30 years from now, you're going to be sick.  Jim Norton of signing MASH stuff?  No fucking way.  I don't know.  That's kind of a dick move, man.  Ringo Starr said he was, but Ringo probably gets so many, when he came out and he goes,  just don't send me any more stuff.  He's an asshole, too.  Sign the Beatles shit.  He says he's too busy to sign autographs.  Just sign it.  He could have, yeah.  But I have to think of things.  Or at least, like, make a statement.  And I'm trying to get to everything that is sent to me on a regular basis, but at this 
[00:17:00]  point, I can't keep up with it.  I'll do my best.  But he comes out and just basically says, fuck you.  Fuck you.  I don't give a fuck what Robbie says.  Fuck you all.  Could it be, though, that a guy, like, these guys start to see stuff on eBay, and they know  that, like, since the internet, it's no longer just fans.  Now it's a business for people.  So they're actually just signing shit for people.  You know what you mean?  Or selling their stuff.  Good point, but if you have Beatles money, I don't give a fuck if you're selling my used 
[00:17:30]  underwear online.  But there might be a lot more of it coming in, I'm saying.  Who cares?  Eh, I don't know.  He's in a castle somewhere.  Why would he be bothered by that?  A castle.  I would just sign everything.  All right.  If somebody's desperate enough to take something I signed and put it online, then fuck it.  Yeah.  That kind of fame?  Who wouldn't want that kind of fame?  Beatles fame.  I think they look like assholes.  Is this the video?  Is this saying he won't do it in person or don't send me anything?  Don't send me anything.  Don't send me anything. 
[00:18:00]  Will he do it in person, though?  I don't know.  Let's see.  This is a serious message to everybody watching my update right now.  Peace and love.  Peace and love.  I want to tell you, please, after the 20th of October, do not send fan mail to any address  that you have.  Nothing will be signed after the 20th of October.  If that has a date on the envelope, it's going to be tossed. 
[00:18:30]  I'm warning you with peace and love, but I have too much to do.  So no more fan mail.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And no objects to be signed.  Nothing.  Anyway, peace and love.  Peace and love.  Good.  My God.  Yeah, that's a bit of a dick.  No more fan mail is a dick move.  Yeah.  No fan mail.  No more fan mail.  Fuck you all.  How you handle that is you say, look, I can't keep up anymore.  You know, I'll do my best, but you might not want to send me stuff anymore because you're 
[00:19:00]  not going to get it back.  But to just basically say I'm not signing anything.  I'm going to be very busy taking drum lessons.  See, because I suck.  Yeah, that's kind of a dick move.  I think so.  Well, no more fan mail.  It's going to be tossed.  Tossed.  It's going to be tossed.  I think it's such a hassle to be a Beatle.  Shut up.  You know, and again, but I'm coming from a point of view of fucking fat tits from Jersey  who gets the occasional letter.  If I got what he got, would I be the same?  Maybe I'd be the same.  Maybe I'd be different. 
[00:19:30]  I don't know.  Yeah.  But when you get it from all over the world, everywhere, they just pour you in in different  languages.  And you know what shitty handwriting he's had to read?  What else is he trying to fuck his wife?  And he's got to read, yell a submarine!  Exclamation point.  He's tired of it.  He's 70.  Half the band is dead.  He's like, oh, great.  Now we have to carry the burden?  Enough!  I guess.  You make a good point there, Jim.  But he has people.  So the people could, you know, organize everything. 
[00:20:00]  Or filter through the bullshit.  Could you sign for an hour?  Here you go.  Because you know he's still getting it.  So maybe they do filter through the stuff that's fucking nonsense.  And to say, like, the real stuff, give me and I'll sign it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Or maybe he just said, fucking throw it out.  Yeah.  Speaking of...  Toss it.  Speaking of the Beatles, you know what?  We could start here today.  Ah.  You got the CeeLo and you got the Justin Bieber doing Beatles songs for the New Year's Eve.  Yeah.  CeeLo, a little controversial.  I guess he switched a few of the words around to imagine. 
[00:20:30]  How do you feel when a band changes words around?  It happens from time to time.  Ah, don't give a shit.  You don't care?  No.  Especially something like New Year's Rockin' Eve.  When CeeLo Green's up there.  Who cares if he changes the words around?  There's nothing rocking about the Dick Clark Rockin' Eve.  It is so anti-rocking.  I'm becoming a softie, man.  Because I was live tweeting all that shit.  Having a good time.  Then Dick Clark popped on the screen. 
[00:21:00]  I'm like, I don't feel like tweeting anymore.  Really?  It's just not fun anymore.  He looked horrendous.  I tweeted that he looked like a sweet potato.  The makeup they put on him.  But other people said he looked like an Oompa Loompa.  Oompa Loompa.  Either way, he looked horrendous.  I'm like, this isn't fun.  He was not looking good.  Lady Gaga.  Fuck Lady Gaga.  The mayor.  Fuck the mayor.  Her honor, the mayor.  Fuck Kathy Griffin.  Kathy Griffin.  Oh, boy.  Look at what Dick Clark.  I mean, I know it's radio. 
[00:21:30]  Did he die and they just CGI'd him?  Makeup looked good.  Yeah, look at that makeup.  In all fairness.  Look at his hand.  I looked it up.  He's 82, 83.  Survived the stroke.  In all fairness, sounding better.  But not good enough to be on TV.  I thought he sounded a little bit worse.  But maybe it's hard to say.  But like last year to this year is one better is one worse.  And I would bet a lot of money.  And we have a guy.  I don't want to blow up his spot.  That was within feet of Dick Clark.  So I got to ask him a few questions.  Oh, right.  We saw him.  Yeah.  But I don't want to blow up his spot. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  Because a lot of the listeners know who this guy is, too.  Yeah.  I would bet a lot of money that Dick Clark counting down from 10 or 20, I think it was.  Yeah.  Is pre-recorded.  Pre-recorded now?  They did it a bunch of times until it looked like, okay, we could use this one.  Ah.  I would bet a lot of money.  Interesting.  Because the first year when he really fucked it up, that I believe was live.  Right.  Because they're like, all right, Dick, we're going to go live.  But after that, they're like, we can't do this again.  There's no fucking way.  So let's pre-record Dick.  They don't show him counting it down. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  They just have his voice.  And we'll use the best one he does.  He probably did it for three straight hours, and they finally found one they could kind of use.  I wonder if they do that.  That's a good point.  I would bet a lot of money.  Piece it together.  I'll go $1,000 on this right now with anybody.  Yeah, you know, I might agree with you there.  Because like you just said, yeah, they don't really show his face.  Because they can't match up the video.  No, no.  So they just have him.  They show like Times Square.  In the studio.  And then he hears voice in the background. 
[00:23:00]  But he came on the screen.  I'm like, I'm done live tweeting.  This is just fucking depressing.  Had it.  It was fun for a few years.  But now it's like, what are they doing?  Whose decision is it to keep him on camera?  Dick.  Ryan Seacrest.  Because he owns the show, right?  No one.  You cannot fuck with Dick Clark.  Dick's not going anywhere.  You can't fuck with Dick Clark.  Even to this day.  Like, we'd make fun of him.  But he fucking is still Dick Clark.  You know what really showed Dick Clark for who he is?  Oh, yeah.  Michael Moore?  Bowling for Columbine.  When Dick Clark was in the van and they were trying to, I guess he wanted an answer from 
[00:23:30]  Dick Clark.  And it's Michael Moore.  So he's just an idiot.  He walks up to the van.  He wants some answers about why this woman has to drive so far to go to a job.  It's just some horse shit.  And Dick Clark goes, all right, come on.  Shut the door.  Shut the door.  He's getting all mad.  And some assistant just slams the van door in Michael Moore's face.  And you should have ran him over. 
[00:24:00]  So I'm going to say it on the phones.  He was about three seconds behind.  I think he was about two seconds behind.  But I'm still going with my theory because maybe someone fucking fucked up by pushing  play.  Didn't fire the fucking sound effects.  I don't know.  I don't think he does the countdown live.  I don't either.  And it's sad that he feels like he still has to be on camera.  And I wonder if he knows that it's still doing great ratings because people are looking  at a freak show.  Well, yeah.  They're not tuning in to Dick Clark because it's a fun, rockin' Eve party that they have 
[00:24:30]  to be part of.  They're like, oh, we got to see what he looks like this year.  And Ryan Seacrest, we were talking about it at my house.  He has to go home knowing he fucking fakes the whole fucking thing.  Hey, that's right, Dick.  And makes believe that Dick is still in porn.  And makes believe he can understand what Dick Clark's saying.  You're the man, you know, just to share this night with the wonderful Dick Clark.  To me, that is, shut up, you phony. 
[00:25:00]  I was asking people, there's no fucking way that he goes home and feels good about himself.  I don't care how much money he's making for that.  Yeah.  To have to fake it like that.  Oh, for that kind of cash.  Huh?  For that kind of cash.  But if you sat down Ryan Seacrest with no fucking cameras on, nothing, he would beat  the shit out of Dick Clark, you got to think.  And go, oh, yeah, this is a fucking nightmare.  It's an annoying, doddering fool won't fucking leave.  So, you know what?  After we talk about CeeLo Green, I'm reading the lyrics.  It's only one lyric change. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  And typically, I don't have a problem with it.  But now I'm kind of like, ah, fuck CeeLo Green.  Right.  You know what?  It's like, Lennon wrote a brilliant song.  And the lyric he changed was, nothing to kill or die for and no religion too, is Lennon's  line.  And he wrote, nothing to kill or die for and all religion's true.  And whatever his reason was, it's like, why are you singing this?  Either sing it or don't.  But if you can't interpret the song and make it yours lyrically, that just annoys me.  That's a huge change, though.  It is.  It is a big change. 
[00:26:00]  That's a massive fucking change.  Yeah.  And it doesn't fit the song anymore.  Right.  You know, Lennon was like, basically saying religion is the cause of a lot of problems.  Yes.  And now CeeLo is basically saying, no, man, all religions are true.  Oh, fuck CeeLo.  What he was saying, this is what he's his argument, is that he goes, I meant no disrespect.  I was trying to say a world where you can believe what you wanted.  That's all.  You know what?  But you're already in that world.  You know what?  Then write a song about that.  Don't use someone else's song. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  Asshole.  The whole essence of the song, imagine, is to take everything that people fight over.  Right.  And, you know.  And wipe it out.  And wipe it out.  And then, you know, that would give people, there'd be no reason to brawl.  Right.  So you can't add religion in.  Because the second there's religion and two people have different religions, they're going  to want to kill each other over it.  So you can't have that.  It doesn't fit the song.  If CeeLo wants that message out there, then try to write a brilliant song like Imagine,  you asshole. 
[00:27:00]  He's a good songwriter.  He does.  He does interesting stuff.  He doesn't need to do that.  Fuck you is great.  Yeah.  It's not quite Imagine.  Exactly.  I guess so.  He made fuck you lyrical and enjoyable, but maybe he just couldn't get over the hump and  write about God.  But saying all religion is true, that goes completely against Lennon's message.  Yeah.  Here's how it sounded.  Just that part.  Imagine there's no conscience.  It isn't hard to do. 
[00:27:30]  Nothing to kill or die for.  And all religion is true.  I don't like it.  Nah, he's a douche.  I don't like it at all.  I don't think it's disrespectful.  Because if you're an artist, don't do that.  Yeah.  I don't like it at all, man.  That changes the whole fucking meaning.  It's silly. 
[00:28:00]  That's not a subtle change.  That's a fucking massive change.  Well, to me, that wasn't the true Beatles abomination of the evening.  Oh, please.  Preach it, brother.  Justin Bieber sang Let It Be.  And this weak voice, little nothing.  Just, I mean, it was such a horrible version of that song.  Yeah.  I think all that's going to catch up with this kid.  His voice is definitely weak. 
[00:28:30]  And he's picking, like, Beatles songs now?  Yeah.  It's all going to come crashing down on this kid.  Is he picking Beatles songs, do you think, because he's trying to bridge into a bit of an older audience?  Because he's tired of...  Or whoever's making the decision for him.  I think his voice is so weak that his people behind him are picking massive songs that everyone knows.  Yeah.  Which makes it easier to kind of hide the fact that his voice is probably just above average at this point. 
[00:29:00]  He's very mediocre.  His voice, his dumb dancing isn't good.  I think he's a great dancer.  Is he a thing, though?  Yes.  Wonderful moves.  He's got quite the moves.  Sure does.  Kid lights it up.  I was telling you guys, he's got good people behind him, though, because they know, all right, we get Carlos Santana.  Because when Carlos Santana hits the stage with that goddamn guitar, you're instantly hooked.  But a corny example, but this is the difference between someone like him and Lady Gaga, whether people like her. 
[00:29:30]  She's a genuine superstar.  She's a great performer.  She goes out there by herself.  He's always teamed up with somebody else.  Right.  I mean, but I got to continue with that.  And I fucking hate that she has to dress like it's Halloween every fucking time she performs because I think her talent and her voice alone is good enough.  She doesn't need all that horse shit.  Right.  I agree.  And she doesn't have to be always profound about everything.  It's her gimmick.  Sometimes you're just doing something.  It doesn't have this deep fucking meaning all the time. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, sometimes just going out and singing a song.  Right.  Whatever.  Right.  She was all dramatic that she was picked to fucking launch the stupid crystal ball or whatever.  I did like her crawling over the fucking scaffolding and that black number and her ass was just fucking.  They zoomed in her ass crack.  Really?  Yeah.  How'd it look?  It didn't look bad.  I gotta be honest.  I wouldn't mind giving her the old foot.  Foot.  I don't think she's attractive.  Foot.  I think she's sexy.  Sam, would you? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  I know Sam and Jimmy think she's attractive.  You think she's attractive?  She's sexy.  I wouldn't think she's attractive sexy.  There's something fuckable about her.  Absolutely.  I'll give her that much.  Fuck.  She's all right.  I'll give her that much.  Nice big thong bulge.  She's all right.  Justin Bieber?  Justin Biebs.  Yeah.  Santana saved his fucking ass.  I hope Santana got a lot of money to save Bieber's ass.  Yes.  Did you hear this?  Yeah, I heard it, but I didn't think anyone could save him.  You know, Santana did what he did, but it sure didn't save Bieber. 
[00:31:00]  I think it saved the performance.  I don't like Santana either, even though he's a good guitarist.  You don't like Santana?  Why?  Sick of him.  He's so repetitive when he plays.  I'm so sick of fucking Carlos Santana.  Oh, my God.  Now you're going old school, Ant.  Stop.  I know.  That's old school shit.  What's his song recently, which is actually a good song, but he doesn't sing it.  That annoys me.  I feel the same about it.  Is he talking about smooth?  Smooth up, isn't he?  Yeah, whatever.  Smooth up, right?  Wow.  That's not recent anymore.  I think that song was on when we were at N.E.W. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, that's an old song now, Jimmy.  Oh, whatever.  I know he's a good guitarist.  He's tired of him.  But in all fairness, that kind of gave him a second career.  Yeah.  Santana.  So tired of him.  You talking about this?  That's a great riff.  It is.  But he doesn't sing and I just hate him.  What year is this?  I'll go 1997, 98.  I'm going to guess 2000.  Rob Thomas from Matchbox 20 singing. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yes, just annoying.  This is a great song.  It's okay.  No, no, no, no.  I can't let you do that.  99?  Yeah, 99.  What did I say?  Oh, 98.  I see too different.  Yeah.  Just All Right, Jimmy?  Yes.  I love this song.  I'll still play this.  This one is a good song.  It's a pop-baller. 
[00:32:30]  The chorus is good.  What about when it kicks in right about here?  You said this life ain't good enough.  I'd give my world to lift you up.  I could change my life to better suit your mood.  Because you're so smooth.  You're so smooth.  And it's just like the ocean under the moon.  It's the same as the emotion that I get from you. 
[00:33:00]  You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah.  Give me your heart, make it real, or else forget about it.  And there goes Carlos.  Yeah, it's good.  You pulled up a horrible video of this song.  I know.  It's good.  It's like somebody just put it together.  What's his big song from the 70s, though, that I hate so much?  That's okay.  I like, oi, ko, mai, va.  How does that go?  But he has a million of them.  Whenever I hear a song that's annoying, I'm like, who is that? 
[00:33:30]  There goes Santana.  What about the Black Magic Woman?  That's the one I think I don't like, right?  The Black Magic Woman.  That's probably his biggest hits, but I like oi, ko, mai, va.  What's Black Magic?  How does that go?  Black Magic Woman.  Got a Black Magic Woman.  Do, do, do, do, do.  Got a Black Man.  And then repeat that 8,000 times.  Do you know who sings on that?  Who?  I don't know.  That's what annoys me.  You never know who sings on it.  That's what bugs me.  Wait, who did sing Black Magic Woman?  Where's Kevin from Connecticut when you need him?  I fucking don't, don't.  I don't know the answer to that one. 
[00:34:00]  Hopefully right now, Kevin from Connecticut is right now looking out of his car window  and just seeing dirt and his wheels spin.  Turn this up.  How do you not like this, Jimmy?  Oh, it's boring.  Really?  Bores me.  This is literally, this is like auditory sominex.  You don't appreciate the musicianship?  No, he's a good guitarist.  I would never say he's not.  Fuck is he a good guitarist?  But he always bored me.  Yeah, it is just...  Clapton, I always hate it too.  And I know he's a good guitarist, but I hate him. 
[00:34:30]  I probably like, wow, is this sacrilege, but I think I like Carl Santana's playing better  than Clapton.  Good.  I don't.  Fuck Clapton.  Where are you with Santana, eh?  I don't like this.  Do you like anything by Santana?  Nah, a couple of songs maybe, but when he starts fucking doing this for hours on end...  No?  He's just a string stretcher.  He's a string stretcher and he...  Well, we're radio stretchers.  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:35:00]  Cock stretchers.  We stretch our way right to fucking 10 o'clock every day.  Ah.  We got Santana facts coming in.  You want them or not?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  Santana facts.  First phone call of 2012.  Well, Dan!  Hello.  Hi, man.  Good morning.  Well, a crazy Santana fact that you might like or might be bored to death with is this  song was sang by Greg Raleigh, who was the keyboard player, who eventually started Journey.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  This is Greg Raleigh, huh?  Yes.  Fuck, you know what? 
[00:35:30]  I never knew that, I don't think.  And of course, Neil Sean was playing guitar, so I guess they hooked up and got Journey going.  And a little fact about Neil Sean, he's now running around the country with a housewife.  Yes.  The psycho broad that crashed the Obama party.  Oh, that one.  That blonde?  Oh, that one.  Yeah.  Neil Sean is having sex with her.  Good.  Oh, that Neil Sean.  What other Santana facts, Dan?  I hear the reeking in your voice, so I know you're true. 
[00:36:00]  No, no, I'm white.  You got a little Hispanic in your voice there.  Oh, no, no, no.  All right, I apologize.  Oh, I'm punching out.  That's it?  That's your Santana?  You just had one.  It said Santana facts.  Oh, well.  All right, thanks, sir.  Have a good one.  Some people saying Fleetwood Mac did this song first.  Really?  Do we know that?  Wait, do we know that?  Did I know that?  It says it on Wiki, so I guess it's got to be true.  Can I hear Fleetwood Mac doing Black Magic Woman? 
[00:36:30]  This is still going on.  Oh, it is.  And I hate the fact that I guarantee Santana won't let them put their...  How come they don't say the name of the guy singing it in the fucking...  It's always Santana, Santana.  That annoys me.  Yeah.  I'm basically saying the guitar is way more important than the vocals.  Oh, E-Rock's got it in there?  E-Rock, let's hear Black Magic by Fleetwood Mac.  This has got to be early Fleetwood Mac, right?  I got a black magic woman.  I got a black magic woman. 
[00:37:00]  Wait, so Santana didn't even write the song?  His biggest hit?  I don't think I ever knew this.  I don't think Fleetwood Mac wrote this either.  This sounds like a black artist that was fucked over.  I bet you this is fucking Lead Belly.  Yeah.  Or one of those guys.  Probably sang it when he was in prison.  Yeah.  Turns out.  Don't turn your back on me, baby.  It's by Peter Green.  Much less guitar stress in this one than in Santana's pompous version.  Fleetwood Mac was a much different band when they first started. 
[00:37:30]  Then they got the Stevie Nicks that really fucking exploded.  Oh, this is before her.  Oh, yeah.  I never liked them anyway.  Fleetwood Mac?  No.  No.  Respect.  Stand back.  Stand back.  Well, that's not it ever.  That's her solo song.  Oh, yuck a room.  Here's what I love.  Love when Jimmy doesn't like a band and then sings a verse of the song.  I think he's kind of like Stand Back. 
[00:38:00]  That was her when she went solo.  I hated her because she always sounded like she's fucking underwater.  Stand back.  Stand back.  Believe me.  Yeah, she does have that.  Auditory range.  I'll be happy to.  I never liked a lot of their stuff.  Gold Dust Woman.  None of that shit.  I wouldn't know it.  It's sort of faggy music for a guy to like.  It's terribly faggy.  To tell you the truth.  Ah, come on.  That wasn't really it.  It's all right to get faggier once in a while.  Did you like Tusk?  That's the drum song.  Tusk was all right. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, we never got to Bieber.  Yeah, we got to Bieber.  We didn't hear him let it be.  Do we have Peter Green doing Black Magic Woman?  Or he just wrote it?  That's it?  Or Letter B like they did on Sesame Street.  After Letter A comes Letter B.  Letter B.  Oh, I get it.  Brilliant.  Sesame Street was brilliant.  Here's Justin Bieber.  So we get to current day where Justin Bieber did Let It Be with Carlos Santana.  Listen to the autotune in Bieber's voice.  It's subtle, but it's there. 
[00:39:00]  I'm sorry.  They can't sing live is so fucking irritating.  He's terrible.  All of them that can't sing live should just be fucking shot.  He's terrible, but no one knows he's terrible.  He's not terrible.  But he shouldn't be as big as he is, in my opinion.  It's all based on the fact that he had those looks that the little girls fucking just creamed  over.  And that's what it was.  There are plenty of people more talented than the gentleman.  Let the record state we never got to hear Oi Como Va.  Oi Como Va. 
[00:39:30]  Or is it Como?  Oi Como Va.  Can we play that?  Going on a break?  Oh, why not?  It'll make my fucking New Year.  Oh, we should.  Here's Justin Bieber.  Let It Be.  How you guys feeling tonight?  Shut up.  I'm so happy to be here to bring in this New Year with you guys.  You guys?  With all you've been through, your spirit's never been broken.  What?  What are you talking about?  You're talking to 12-year-olds.  Here he goes.  How tough has their lives been? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  With all you've been through.  Talk to a 35-year-old.  You lost your lip gloss.  Right.  It's horrible.  What have they been through?  You had a boyfriend of three days who broke up with you.  Yeah.  Know how heart-wrenching that can be.  The fuck?  Who is he talking to?  I don't know, man.  11 and 12-year-olds.  Yeah.  He's trying to appeal to a bit of – he's trying to bridge to an older – he's trying  to sound more like an adult where he's going, I know you've been through some hard times.  He's just talking to the country in general for the economy and things of that nature because 
[00:40:30]  he's tired of fucking – he's trying – he sees the end coming.  Oh, the warden from Midnight Express just walked by.  Roland.  Say, they said 10.30.  William A.C. is 10.30, but what time is he in?  10 o'clock.  Why don't we get him?  Why don't we get him?  10.30.  Go and get on.  And he'll beat your feet with a stick while two chubby children stand next to him.  Oh, very good question coming in from Derek on Long Island.  No.  Do you think ABC pressured CeeLo to change the fucking lyrics? 
[00:41:00]  You know how everything has to be PC these fucking days?  No.  No.  No way.  It's a good thought, though.  You can't PC a fucking Lennon song.  Yeah, really?  You can't?  All the shit they're doing nowadays?  Yeah, but Lennon songs, that pretty much – it's –  You think that would be controversial?  Because especially since in a politically correct world, what CeeLo did was not politically correct.  It was politically –  PC would be to remove the religion from something. 
[00:41:30]  That's what PC thinking is.  You don't say religion is true, and that's not PC.  I guarantee you the network wouldn't go near that.  Okay, good point.  So it was CeeLo being the dick.  Make your own dumb religion song.  Leave Lennon's shit alone.  CeeLo.  Big Lennon fan.  You can't fuck around with his shit.  Ah, Bieber.  Never been broken.  We all do the best we can each year.  Like the Hyman's.  Learning from our past to be better in the future.  Yeah.  It's happened, it's happened. 
[00:42:00]  And what will be, will be.  So what I say is –  So what I says –  So what I says –  So what I says is –  Is –  Let it be.  But he said, whatever will be, will be.  So whatever I say is let it be.  No, we should sing Que Sera Sera then.  That's a –  Yeah.  What a terrible fucking –  That's horrible.  What a –  That's like if you're like, you know, I know we've all been on trains that are crazy.  So what I say is crazy trains. 
[00:42:30]  Crazy trains.  That fucking stinks.  That was terrible.  You know, we've all gone underwater in apparatuses that were kind of a combination of blue and green.  Oh, wait.  How do you make yellow?  I fucked up.  I don't know primary colors.  I'm sorry.  Primary.  I think you can make yellow.  I suck.  Yeah, you can't make yellow, right?  I meant to say what –  I guess blue and yellow make green.  Yeah, yeah.  Yellow is the primary.  Let me boo myself.  Wait, can you make yellow?  No, you can't fucking stink.  I was trying to improv.  But you have to be able to make yellow.  We just haven't figured it out. 
[00:43:00]  No, we just haven't figured it out yet.  Yeah.  Think about it.  It's a primary color.  I think people have been thinking about it for many years.  Why?  Because humans say we can't make yellow?  Oh.  There's got to be a way to make yellow.  Think about it.  Make yellow in my pants.  There you go.  It's happened, it's happened.  And what will be, will be.  So what I say is –  So what I say is –  Oh, we know this song. 
[00:43:30]  Do we?  What is this?  They don't really know it because –  Yeah, they're like, huh?  If you play that for anyone over the age of –  I probably have to say 30 at this point,  the place will go fucking nuts.  Do you hear the crowd noise was very level?  Yeah, they're like, well, I don't –  Right.  You know what I'm trying to say?  A hundred percent.  When you see Billy Joel's last concert and McCartney comes out,  and they say hello, and then he sits down,  and he just goes –  Of course, he does an intro.  You don't intro let it be.  No, you just play the song, you idiot.  And the first note that's hit, 90,000 people are like, 
[00:44:00]  holy shit, we're getting to hear let it be.  He had to set it up with some of the words.  Yeah, yeah.  And he couldn't –  And even that didn't get a big –  You know, it's like I say,  we drive a Volkswagen Beetle here.  Whatever will be, will be.  See, it's just very level.  Same response.  Oh, now they pump it up.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  You hear the autotune?  Subtle autotune, but it's there.  And in my hour of darkness,  she is standing right in front of me,  speaking words of wisdom.  Let it be.  It's so weak.  Let it be.  Let it be. 
[00:45:00]  Let it be.  Let it be.  Let it be.  Oh, he's trying to do a little vocal aerobics.  And the autotune's helping out.  Oh, did you hear Carlos?  Yeah.  That was a little –  I'm coming on stage, motherfuckers.  Come on, Carlos.  Pump this shit up.  Come on.  Weak, right, Ed? 
[00:45:30]  So.  Yeah.  You know this shit way more than me,  but that sounds weak.  It's just standing weak.  Eat it.  It's falling apart.  And let it be.  Yeah.  What was that? 
[00:46:00]  His improvs are terrible.  It's just –  Wow.  Oh.  Ladies and gentlemen, Carlos Santana.  There's a fuck.  Oh.  Fuck.  More string stretching. 
[00:46:30]  He does a good job with it,  but who gives a shit that he's there?  He's totally unnecessary.  He's not about the fucking –  No, he's not totally unnecessary.  They knew they needed something to pump this song up,  that he can't pull it off by himself.  No, that's exactly –  Paul McCartney and a fucking piano that, you know,  he doesn't need Carlos or anybody else.  And by the way, we were lucky enough to see Paul McCartney recently,  and he still sings Let It Be like it's 1967. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, it's fantastic.  We got a little of that, right?  Holy fuck.  Let's hear the difference.  Yeah.  That sounds fucking great. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, effortless, right?  Yeah.  No auto-tune.  No Coliseum.  Auto-tuning.  Oh, it's just Paul's voice.  Speaking words of wisdom.  Let it be.  We don't have to play it.  Oh, let it be.  Let it be.  Let it be.  That's how you do it.  It's just fucking good.  Sounds good.  Sounds good.  Bieber sounds bad.  Bieber bad. 
[00:48:00]  Good for Bieber,  but I don't think the audience matches.  The talent.  He is desperately trying to appeal to older people.  Yes, that's what that is.  By tying him with Santana.  He's trying so hard to not be the teeny bopper white kid falling off the cliff.  So he brings in fucking Busta Rhymes.  Usher's always been there.  You know what?  You have to perform with him every time.  You're right, Jimmy.  They're throwing everything at him to try to keep him relevant.  Yeah.  They're throwing a little auto-tune in there.  You saw the Busta Rhymes thing at, what, the tree lighting ceremony, was that? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  When he did that?  His voice is weak.  And now Carl Santana.  Because you're thinking, all right, we need a guitar part there.  Let's get someone that can really fucking do this.  He really does kind of stink.  And the Carl Santana angles with, you know, the kind of Rob Thomas thing.  You know what I mean?  No.  Rob Thomas?  You know, smooth up in you.  Oh, oh, oh.  Not smooth up in you.  That's a...  Who did smooth up in you?  Bullet Boys?  Anyone?  What?  Right? 
[00:49:00]  Who?  Fucking look up Bullet Boys.  Was that smooth up in...  Smooth up in you!  Bullet Boys, people are saying yes.  We play that on AF.  The only station that really rocks.  Smooth up in you!  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  A Bullet Boys reference.  Yeah.  To start the new year.  Somewhere Eddie Trunk is coming.  Right.  Speaking of which, he was tweeting about the Van Halen thing.  Was he?  Holy fuck.  At Cafe Wa, right?  What? 
[00:49:30]  What?  Huh?  I have no idea.  Oh, did Jimmy just fuck up something?  No.  I was announced yesterday.  Jimmy's face got like...  Dude, if you fucked up, you gotta go with it.  I don't think I did.  You got some inside info?  No, I think it was actually...  You made a face like, fuck, I wasn't supposed to say that.  No, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Wait, you're confusing everybody.  You're panicking.  What's going on?  Okay, because Van Halen is doing a set at Cafe Wa in the village. 
[00:50:00]  Holy shit.  There's 250...  It's Thursday.  Yeah, it's like a rumor.  Oh, it is.  I don't know.  I mean...  I heard it from a comedian.  It's not a rumor if Jimmy knows, because Jimmy knows that whole area.  I like how Jimmy just said that.  I heard it from a comedian.  Please, trust me.  I didn't hear it from anybody in your music.  Trust me on this.  It's online.  Really?  How do you guys feel about the Van Halen thing with David Lee Roth?  No, enough with them.  I'd like you to see that, though.  In that club?  We're back!  That's an amazing... 
[00:50:30]  Cafe Wa in the village is legendary.  Like, Plyer used to work there.  Miles Davis.  It's an amazing acoustic.  I'm just...  I'm so fucking done with Van Halen in any way, shape, or form.  Really?  Yeah.  Enough.  Didn't they do the Van Halen with David Lee Roth already?  Yes!  So what's different about this?  I'm confused now.  It's just like an extended version of that?  Just go away.  Supposedly there's a new song coming out.  Do we have the new song yet?  I hear it's dropping today.  So we should have it, don't you think?  Yes, I believe we do. 
[00:51:00]  Well, no, I mean, we can do our thing, but I want to hear the real thing.  That is the real thing.  Oh, yeah.  Which is the real thing?  Oh, this is the new Van Halen?  Oh, okay.  Sounds like Van Halen.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's good.  We've been away for a long, long, long, long time.  We've been changing.  We've played some games.  The more things change, the more things stay the same. 
[00:51:30]  Stay the same, I say.  We'll have a hold of a winter glider.  We're back.  We're better than ever.  We're back.  We're back.  Yeah.  Together forever.  We're back.  Yeah.  We're back.  We're better than ever.  We're back.  We're back.  This is just as good as any shit they can come up with at this point. 
[00:52:00]  We're back.  We're back.  You didn't like it to be back-to-back during the video?  Oh, no.  I didn't like any of the choreography you came up with.  We're a little bit older, but we ain't much wiser.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  Yeah.  Brand new Van Halen debuted here.  We're back.  Wow, I didn't know that, Jimmy.  Oh, man.  I've heard live Van Halen over the years with David Lee Roth.  I've never got into live fucking Van Halen with David Lee Roth. 
[00:52:30]  We get it.  We went to a bunch of Van Hagar shows.  Yeah.  Sammy Hagar knows how to fucking perform.  Yeah.  A lot of people-  David Lee Roth, not so much after those leg kicks.  Well, you'll get a lot of people arguing about that.  I know.  I just started a whole fucking thing now, but-  Where?  Are there people out there that have actually seen live Van Halen with David Lee Roth and  Sammy Hagar at this point?  Oh.  They would have to be some old fuckers, right?  Oh, I did. 
[00:53:00]  But I mean, back in the day, I don't mean David Lee Roth a couple years ago, whenever  they did that thing.  I'm talking David Lee Roth, Van Halen in their prime, which means you've got to go back to  the 70s, late 70s, early 80s, right?  I did see them at Nassau Coliseum.  Was David Lee Roth good as a performer?  Well, you know what?  Everyone was so rapt.  I can't give an honest assessment, because at the time-  You're fucked up.  It was the best fucking thing that ever happened.  Because Van Halen was huge. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  You're just there.  It's loud.  It's fucking, you know, everyone's smoking the weed.  And they ruled.  They ruled.  So it's tough to say.  Yeah.  My memory of it is fantastic.  I've heard live tracks over the years.  I never got into it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Whatever.  It does just mean anything to anyone.  Probably not.  Who gives up?  Oh, they are back-to-back in that picture.  Oh, of course they are.  Is that Eddie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, I forgot how short his hair was.  Let me see him. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  He looks better than I thought he did, though.  He looks younger than I thought he did.  He looks healthier.  Yeah, I would never recognize him.  Wow.  Yeah.  They leave Roth's face and that smile you always recognize.  That dumb face.  Yeah.  Who's playing bass?  Is Michael Anthony still fucking, what, staying home because everyone cares about the bassist?  Asshole?  No, because he's friends with Sammy Hagar.  Who cares?  He's Team Hagar.  But he was there from the beginning, right?  They're doing their Cabo Wabo shit.  Oh, that fucking awful.  Oh, you're going to sing about whiskey.  Yuck. 
[00:54:30]  Fucking asshole.  Cabo Wabo.  How terrible.  Do a shot.  Yuck.  They sing about tequila.  Do a shot.  How fucking awful.  It's not whiskey, though.  It's tequila.  Hey, what's tequila?  Yes.  Yes.  Tequila.  Yeah, we're all wearing open-toed shoes.  Yeah, we're all wearing open-toed shoes.  Mott's tequila.  Sammy's a friend of the show, Jimmy.  No, he's not. 
[00:55:00]  What?  What's the last time he was in?  Exactly.  They were supposed to perform.  He didn't come in.  What happened?  He didn't come in.  What happened?  He said no.  He said no?  Of course he did.  He said no to fuck Sammy Hagar.  He said no to Boneyard.  My Boneyard should do.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  But that said, even if he said yes, I'd still hate this song.  Cabo Wabo.  You don't like the Cabos?  It fucking stinks.  I hate rock songs about the islands.  This is what you drink when you're down there wearing a wild Hawaiian shirt.  You'll get fucking beach sand on your feet.  Fuck you. 
[00:55:30]  That sounds kind of nice, Jimmy.  Sounds awful.  When you want to be in a warm place with a nice toddy.  Why wouldn't you go on tour with fucking Van Halen when you're the original bassist?  Why would you split it down the middle?  I don't get it.  Well, I don't know.  There's a lot of bad blood there.  Michael Anthony's the one that did all the high harmonies, too, over David Lee Roth.  So it was very important to the Van Halen sound in the day.  Well, don't they have Wolf?  Isn't Wolf playing bass?  Wolfgang is.  Wolfie.  Wolfie?  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Wolfie's an old man by now.  He's got to be.  Been hearing about that kid forever.  Damn, that's true.  Yeah.  He's got to be 30 years old at this point.  Come on.  The original band should do the original band thing, or it's not the original band.  Unless somebody dies.  Then you can understand it.  Well, happens to the best of them.  Yeah, where is he?  What's Michael Anthony doing?  You want to know?  Yeah, yeah.  He's with Sammy Hagar.  I'm with the Cabos.  They're pals.  Sammy Hagar and the Cabos.  Is he in chicken foot?  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  That's what he's doing.  He's doing chicken foot. 
[00:56:30]  Asshole.  Maybe he has more fun doing chicken foot than dealing with Eddie's fucking attitude.  At this point, can't they just go out and make $100 million on the tour and stop?  I know.  Well, that's what Guns N' Roses should be doing, too, right?  Well, you know, why would you when you could just not show up for interviews and not do  any press?  That's what they should all be doing.  He's just a prick.  The guy's a prick, making his fans wait like that.  What a fucking prick. 
[00:57:00]  Like, what a selfish, me, me, me.  That's all Axl is.  And he's a great singer.  Great.  But it's like, he makes you just hate lead singers.  He's actually amazing.  Selfish fucking cocksucker.  But he was his own worst enemy.  Oh, what a douche.  I love the fact that Duff and Slash went on to other massive bands without him.  But it was easy at that point.  I mean, I love that they did that, too.  But they probably had $100 million in the bank at that point.  So they said, yeah, we could easily do this. 
[00:57:30]  True.  Right?  Yeah.  I feel bad for the caterers that had a nice gig.  Yeah.  They're the ones that got fucked.  They're the ones in some shitty fucking restaurant somewhere now going, fuck, man.  Sucks.  We had good lives.  But Axl had to fuck it up for everyone.  Wow.  What's this now?  What are you looking up, Jimmy?  They're one of the five rock bands, Van Halen, so massive they are, that have had two albums,  some more than 10 million copies in the U.S. 
[00:58:00]  I guess as far as rock is concerned, they're the 56th, wait, 19th, I'm sorry, 19th best-selling  band of all time.  That's tremendous.  Wow.  Yeah, that's pretty big.  Wow.  ACDC's up there in the top five, I know.  Sure.  I'm sure Kiss is up there, because they've sold 80 million albums.  What were the two Van Halen albums?  I don't know.  Hopefully OU812.  Well, I'm wondering if there was one from the David Lee Roth years and one from the Sammy  Hagar years.  Could This Be Love was rocking.  That might be from that one, too. 
[00:58:30]  Dude, OU812 was a massive album for Van.  It was.  That was their biggest one with Hagar, right?  Yeah, it was pretty big, yeah.  So which two?  I really want to know now.  Didn't say which two albums it was?  Yeah, well, I'd just say...  You know, fucking name the albums, you fucking fucker.  I need to know which two.  I don't know.  God, where are we?  1984.  Oh, 1984 was their biggest selling?  Van Halen.  Really?  Is that in just order of...  Wait, are you sure this is order? 
[00:59:00]  Let's go.  84 had Panama and Jump on it.  No, 84 was a great album.  It was a little too poppy for me, but it was absolutely a great album.  So you had 1984 was their biggest album, then Van Halen from 1978, then 5150, okay.  Oh, 5150.  Yeah, 5150.  That's the one with Sammy Hagar.  Oh, you, 812 is a terrible cover.  It's a terrible cover.  Why?  It just reminds me of old sticks.  It's like the old Beatles cover, Meet the Beatles or something. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, it's just their four heads and shadow.  Oh, you, 812.  I don't know what that means.  But 5150 was the third song.  The tumor?  That was their answer to David Lee Roth's album.  His album was Eat Em and Smile.  Right.  And then they came out with OU812 as like a goof on ham.  Yeah.  Really?  A little Van Halen fact.  Do you know what I just realized?  Factoid.  30 years later.  And this is very inside Ozzy stuff, and I know I always bring it back to Ozzy, but I just  realized that Ozzy used to hang a midget during his act. 
[01:00:00]  Yes, he did.  When he would sing Goodbye to Romance, Ronnie the Midget would get hung, and it was really  cool, this love song, and then the midget's getting strung up.  And I just realized within two or three months, I mean, of now, that that was making fun of  Ronnie James Dio.  Oh, really?  He had a midget on stage named Ronnie.  I never connected the fact, because he would always tease Sabbath for having Ronnie, and  he would always say, like, they've got their own midget on stage. 
[01:00:30]  And I literally, 30 years later, realized, oh my god, he was goofing on Dio by naming  the midget Ronnie and hanging him.  That's pretty funny.  I fucking never caught that.  God, am I dumb.  I remember he'd go, say hello to Ronnie, and the midget would come out.  Wow, that's funny.  I never got that.  That's a great gag.  Yeah.  Ozzy's funny, though.  We all know that.  Funny, yeah, but Jesus.  He's got a great sense of humor.  Too cool for the room.  I didn't get it.  What a dope I am.  That happens.  He's an alt comic.  Ozzy's very ironic. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  All right, we should break, I guess.  Yeah, let's eat here.  Yeah, I want to hear oi como va.  It's driving people nuts that I'm saying oi como va a lot.  We're going to take a break, and when we get back, it's tradition.  When we come back, first show of the year, we've got to go through the Dick Clark audio.  Of course.  So we'll do a little of that.  Can we talk about the Ramones at one point today?  No, we can't.  Just for a second.  No, no, no.  Please?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. 
[01:01:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Oye cómo va, mi ritmo, bueno pa' gozar, la, oye cómo va, mi ritmo, bueno pa' gozar, la.

[01:05:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show  Get in topical  Hold up, wait a minute  with the sex man, good morning sexy, happy new year, how was your holidays? 
[01:06:00]  It was very good, yeah?  Yes.  Get everything you got to get everything you want to get to Christmas, what was your big gift?  Well, the big gift I had was this new gift I had was this new Canon camera, which was nice, but you know, DVDs, video games, clothes.  Any wrestling stuff? 
[01:06:30]  That's a cool gift, yeah?  That's a cool gift, yeah?  That's a cool gift.  That's a cool gift.  That's a cool gift.  Did Angie get that for you?  No, somebody else in my family got it.  Oh, okay.  That's cool, they probably forged it, but that's not a good gift. 
[01:07:00]  That's a great gift.  It's a great gift.  It's a great gift.  It's awesome.  It's a great gift.  How do you know it's real?  I have to kind of take it on the way, and I looked online, too, to match the signature.  It looks pretty authentic.  Say certificate of authenticity, and I'll go in there and kick you to that.  No, no, no, no.  That's all bullshit.  Of course, it's like a guy would fake an autograph, but then make sure that the certificate was real.  Yeah, but it came from that guy, so who cares?  Yeah, the certificates don't come from anywhere.  They could just print them out and say, yeah, it's him.  Swear.  You know how I know if it's real if I hand it to a guy and he signs it, and even then I doubt it. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, yeah, topical.  Why the Zeppelin?  It is John Paul Jones' birthday.  He's 66 years old.  Wow.  Cool.  66.  I would guess older.  Yeah.  He's been around forever.  I don't know.  That's pretty old.  You don't like this one, do you?  It's a good song.  So played. 
[01:08:00]  Just so fucking.  Some songs are so played, it doesn't matter how long you go without hearing them.  You just, you can't hear them again.  Yeah, this one's just okay in my book.  Yeah.  By the way, can I say, I fucking Ron Paul.  Fuck Iowa.  But I'm happy to see Ron Paul doing so well in Iowa.  Mitt Romney's a bore.  I really want Ron Paul.  God, Romney is a bore.  I am fucking officially going to start pulling for Ron Paul.  Well, Ron Paul will not get elected.  You'll end up with four more years of Obama, but. 
[01:08:30]  I could live with that.  Do you really think that he wouldn't get elected, though?  No.  No.  Ron Paul?  No.  I don't know, man.  If it was only him against Obama.  Hear me out.  But he's, Republicans will go with him over Obama, and also a lot of radical left, he's  a lot of radical liberal guys who you think would be like radical Democrats, but they like  him.  He has a really weird, he's one Republican who pulls these radical lefty guys who should  be voting for Obama.  It's just, he's too weird.  I love that.  I know, you love it. 
[01:09:00]  That's like a fuck you to the system in a way.  Mainstream America doesn't love weird.  I love the fuck you to the system, too, Jimmy, but he doesn't have a shot.  I don't know, man.  He's a smart guy.  But it pushes forward, like hopefully someday we can get a third party and other things  happening, but...  Depends on who he picks his VP.  If he has a good vice presidential choice, Ron Paul, maybe say he picks Condoleezza Rice.  I don't know if she's qualified, but she had a great reputation.  She was in the Bush administration.  She's a smart woman.  She has a great...  There's nothing scandalous in her life other than the fact that she may not like cock. 
[01:09:30]  I mean, why not?  Well, that's a big one.  Wasn't she Secretary of State for a while?  I mean, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, well...  He doesn't have a shot.  I don't think so, either.  I don't think so, no matter who he brings on.  It's fun to watch, but he doesn't have a shot.  I don't know, man.  That's scary how boring Mitt Romney is.  Yeah.  Are you a Mitt Romney guy, Ant?  I'm whoever...  That's your party.  ...gets the Republican nomination guy.  But are you a Mitt Romney guy?  Be honest.  You're not too thrilled.  I'll fucking vote for him. 
[01:10:00]  He's the candidate.  Are you secretly hoping for a stronger candidate?  I don't care.  I think he needs some charisma.  I don't give a shit.  I think he needs that charisma if you're going for the White House.  Yeah.  He looks like he's going to have a nervous breakdown.  If you remember, George Sr. was portrayed as a wimp and something like that, and he didn't  do anything, but then he got into office and, you know...  He was likable, though.  Is Romney likable? 
[01:10:30]  I don't know.  It's so hard to tell in these fucking pre-primary bullshit things.  I'm reading between the lines.  You're like, eh, it's Romney.  I'm pulling the lever for whoever fucking is the Republican candidate.  No, I know you'll do that.  I don't care if it's Mary Tyler Moore.  I'm just amazed...  She's not mine.  I'm just amazed these are your choices for your party, sir.  Well...  I'm amazed.  Like, this is the best they could do?  Sorry, we don't have a gimmick like the Democrats did four years ago, so...  Or whatever it was. 
[01:11:00]  I like Obama.  Gimmick.  I really do.  Obama's an ass.  Yeah, probably fair enough.  Jimmy's eye just got really big.  I like Obama.  All the policies stink.  You know what you also like?  Chicken foot.  And farting.  Yeah, farting and chicken foot.  Cobble wobble.  The shark.  You don't like that whole theme he's got going on?  I fucking hate it.  It's like the beach theme.  Tequila.  Fucking assholes.  Sandals.  Relaxing.  Paint one of your toenails black. 
[01:11:30]  Whoa, what a wild time you're having.  Oh, fuck yourself.  That's a Hawaiian shirt that's opened up halfway down your chest.  Thanks.  Digging it.  Gravely voice.  Yeah, yeah.  You're talking like nodding with a drink in your hand with a fucking lemon in it.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  They'll stand there and get your feet wet.  That's why I loved oil in the Gulf.  Good.  That's what you get.  It pleases you that Sammy Hagar might have had oil all the way up to his knees.  All over his dumb feet.  Oh, my God.  Stupid blonde, little wispy hair on his foot. 
[01:12:00]  Good prick.  You don't like when bands go with a theme?  Hate it.  A party theme?  Hate it.  Partying.  We were talking on New Year's Eve how much I hate party songs.  All right.  Anyone who sings about a party is a douche.  Jimmy was cracking us up.  What band was it?  LMFAO.  You know this LMFAO?  Yes.  But Jimmy had some good points about how the party can't get started until certain individuals  arrive.  It drives me nuts.  It drives me nuts.  That's the whole song.  Like everyone's just sitting around, just waiting. 
[01:12:30]  And they tell you what they're going to do in the party.  We're going to get the party.  Of course you are.  Of course you're never.  We're going to come to a party that's already fun and enjoy it.  Enjoy it.  How about once they do that?  We're going to come and dance with everybody and not hog the spotlight.  Pause this because Jimmy's on a roll and I want to hear the lyrics to this song.  That's all that happened.  It just drives me crazy.  It's good.  It drives me crazy.  Basically what you're saying, the people already at the party, they don't understand how to  party until the main party guy shows up.  These assholes act like you're just showing up and the room has no music. 
[01:13:00]  It's quarter to twelve.  We've been here since 8.30.  Where have you been, shiny pants?  Oh, here you are.  It's fucking sickening.  Pompous.  Who's got the song?  You got it?  All right.  Listen to this.  So this is the song.  Oh, this is Shots with Lil Jon.  Oh, good.  Get ready to get choked up.  Let's do it.  I'd call security.  72 million hits.  Lil Jon just scares me. 
[01:13:30]  He's a nice man.  I met him at the Porn Awards.  He's a nice man.  Yeah, he was the...  They were doing that big song years ago when I hosted the Porn Awards.  I introduced him with...  Who are the brothers?  Yeah, you can't get it.  I'm raising the roof.  The club.  Of course.  All eyes on him and the club.  Right.  The club sucked at Talia Rhyme.  Yeah.  We love Tron.  Here's a guy showing up in a wig like the guy from fucking...  Oh, fuck.  The guy from New York. 
[01:14:00]  Everybody.  Shots.  Shots.  This is a club song.  It's just awful, though.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  You don't like that song?  Not only do I not like that song, I hate it.  I don't like Al-Qaeda.  I hate that song.  Is it a beat to dance to?  I just hate the...  I hate party lyrics.  Because it's like they're so fucking awful.  Is there a party song that's actually a good song to listen to? 
[01:14:30]  My Girl Wants to Party All the Time?  Yeah.  Rock and roll night and party every day.  My Girl Wants to Party All the Time.  Andrew W.K.  What happened to him?  He used to be a friend of the show.  He fell off the face of the guy.  He's still wearing that white t-shirt, isn't he?  Currently residing in the Where Are They Now category.  Andrew?  I don't know.  I think he came back a little bit.  Yeah.  All right.  You want to do the audio?  The Dick Clark audio?  It's tradition.  Yes.  First day back from the big holidays. 
[01:15:00]  Of course.  We go through the Dick Clark audio.  Yes.  Were you watching the...  Oh, yes.  Well, I was doing my New Year's Rotten Eve.  Rotten Eve?  I was doing New Year's Rotten Eve, broadcasting that as we watched New Year's Rockin' Eve and  had a little shindig at the house.  New Year's Rotten Eve.  New Year's Rotten Eve.  That's a better name for it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big A was singing.  You are a rotten guy.  Yes.  Then we had a big poker game.  Yeah? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, just kind of hanging out, ringing in the new year.  But yes, I did watch.  Oh, I did watch.  God, this is just...  Zoinks.  Uncomfortable, man.  Yeah.  Here's Ryan introing the boss, Dick Clark.  Oh.  Let's go upstairs to the man who we've been celebrating all night long.  He started this party.  He hasn't been celebrating all night long?  Celebrating it all night long.  Exactly.  God, did you make fun of this?  Of course.  At least his makeup was realistic, though. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, my God.  Why did they go with that orange?  I don't know.  They didn't realize.  Maybe they thought that the filter was different.  He looks fake.  Yeah.  That's what bothered me more than the speech, was the makeup.  It was terrible.  Well, they went with a spray tan, obviously.  Oh, God, yeah.  Where was he all year, though?  In a fucking basement?  At his feet, and he was, like, watching the wine kegs in the basement?  I picture him in one of the bathtubs, like the Toddlers in Tiaras, where they got to  spray tan him.  Holy shit, I was watching some Toddlers in Tiaras. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, the show's great.  I know this is ADD radio today, but...  It's hilarious.  That show's fucked up.  Those parents are fucking shootable.  Oh, fuck that show.  You see the show that was on before it?  Twins' ass.  The Cheapskates.  No.  You didn't see this?  No.  DVR it.  They're running it a million fucking times on TLC.  What did they do?  It was just before Toddlers in Tiaras.  How they save money?  Oh, I didn't see that one.  Is it called Cheapskates?  I forgot the name of it.  There was a lady that reuses toilet paper. 
[01:17:00]  That's lovely.  But I guess...  How does she reuse it?  I guess she has, like, rags that you're supposed to use if you're in her house.  And then what?  You fucking wash them out?  No.  Like a diaper?  Yeah.  And then you put it in the bucket that she provides in her bathroom, and then she washes  them and reuses them.  That just reeks.  She washes them.  Who would hang out with her?  Who would ever just go to...  Every time she said, do you want to come over, people would just go, no, you cunt.  We really should have audio of this show for our show. 
[01:17:30]  With your shit rags.  You didn't see this?  No.  I think some of the people that kind of put it on for the TV show, I think.  Yeah.  But I think this lady's the real deal.  And she brags that doing this, she saves $240 a year.  Big shit.  You're taking $240 of pain in the ass.  But you're washing everyone else's shit.  Yeah.  Is that worth $240 to you?  What do you do with your money?  What do you do with $240 that outweighs shitty rags in a bucket? 
[01:18:00]  That you have to wash out by hand.  Yeah.  How much fun are you having with that $240?  Because I don't think you can just throw that into your washing machine.  I think you've got to hand wash.  And then you put your clothes in there afterwards?  You can't find the clips?  What show is it?  I don't know the name of the fucking show.  Someone help us out.  Let's see.  Hey, look down.  Someone's got it.  What's the name of the show?  A lot of people watch this thing.  What's it called, people?  Anyone?  It wasn't called Cheapskates. 
[01:18:30]  It's a...  No.  No one seems to be coming up with an answer.  Oh, right there.  Jews!  Yeah, it's called...  Answer.  No.  No.  It wasn't...  What?  No, it's not the couponing.  Addiction?  No, it's not couponing.  Come on, man.  Everyone was tweeting about it.  Someone's got the name of the fucking show.  No one's got it down there?  Thrifty Fucks.  It's not Thrifty Fucks.  That sounds like a great show, though. 
[01:19:00]  Extreme Who Gives a Shit.  That's a good one.  Oh, come on, man.  It's not Extreme Cheapskates.  People were losing their minds watching this show.  Maybe I dreamt this.  Maybe I had a good dream.  No?  No one's coming up with it.  No one?  No.  Ooh, Jimmy.  Why all the farts today?  I'm happy to be back.  What'd you eat last night? 
[01:19:30]  I had cottage cheese yesterday, and I'm having some now.  I'm on a diet.  Cottage cheese.  You're officially on a diet?  Yeah.  Because you sure weren't on New Year's Eve.  No, I was a pig.  He wants some cheese, and he's in a little cottage.  Cottage cheese.  Cottage cheese.  Jimmy likes to indulge a little bit.  I do.  Does that taste like anything?  It's good.  Cottage cheese, it's salty.  It's not bad at all.  Cottage cheese sucks.  You've got to add...  Add a little bit of banana.  He's pushing the back of his head down on his own banana.  That's funny.  You've got to do... 
[01:20:00]  You've got to do mandarin oranges with cottage cheese.  It's a perfect combination.  Try it someday.  I don't like citrus with anything milk product.  Extreme Cheapskates.  Thank you, Jim and Philly.  That is Extreme Cheapskates.  Extreme Cheapskates.  Is this the toilet paper brought you?  Here we go.  The extended family of scrubbing bubbles.  Where are we?  Dick Clark Audio, but we've got to play this first, but we have a commercial.  This is the water-activated formula. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  God, how long is this commercial?  Eight, seven, seven, seven, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right, here we go.  I'm cutting toilet paper squares for our bathroom that we will wash and use instead of paper products.  Why?  We have a little bin underneath the basket that holds the little toilet wipes where we put them  so we can wash them later.  And then when it's time to wash, I just pour them in and I never have to touch them with 
[01:21:00]  my hands.  Oh, really?  Buying toilet paper just doesn't do anything for me.  As a middle-class family that makes a good income, I shouldn't have to go into debt to buy  toilet paper.  All of our cloth wipes...  You're not a middle-class family, then.  Going into debt.  Her husband should be fucking causes.  Who puts up with this bitch?  This bitch started out as just some broad in the bar that you found attractive and now  you fast forward and she's a psycho that has to reuse toilet paper.  I don't know if I believe this.  Huh?  Something about this reeks of bullshit. 
[01:21:30]  Something about this reeks of bullshit.  It just...  Yeah.  Look at her eyes.  She looks crazy.  I don't know.  Look at the rest of her house.  She does look crazy.  Yeah, maybe she is.  All right.  We've been using them for more than five years.  Using cloth toilet paper saves us $20 a month.  Over a year, then, that is $240.  I had one person say she couldn't contaminate her washing machine.  I just had to laugh because if you know anything about bacteria, there's no way it can survive  those harsh conditions. 
[01:22:00]  So contamination is not an issue at all.  When Angela first came up with the idea of cloth toilet paper, I was kind of a little skeptical.  Once I got used to it, to me, it's more comforting to have something solid on your hand than the paper stuff.  How about just your hand?  Ew, look at the brown fucking...  It's stained.  It's got stains on it!  Dude, it's stained.  Would you use that?  No!  Oh, God.  That's disgusting.  She's terrible.  There were brown stains on that white fucking rag. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, awful.  And you're supposed to, like, go there and go, oh, yeah, I'll just wipe with a rag.  Even the poorest family out there wouldn't do that.  No.  And you're putting it all in your washing machine?  There's shit all over the place.  I don't care if it's killing the bacteria.  I know, and it's got to stink in the bathroom.  It's got to stink in the whole house.  Yeah.  When you're washing that shit.  It's like, oh, what do you got, a cat?  No, we just shit and wipe with rags.  Problem? 
[01:23:00]  And another, what appears to be, that to me, I think that's a mental illness.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  That you have to deal with.  Great.  Once again, another fucking wacko that just can't get over somebody fucked her shitter when she was four.  How about this?  Go to therapy and stop putting the rest of us through it, you chiseler.  Yeah.  Rest of her family.  Oh.  Poor family has to, you know, cut squares of reusable toilet paper.  You know what?  Fuck the poor family.  They're tolerating it.  The husband's an adult.  The kid has no choice.  If that husband could say, look, bitch, we're not doing that. 
[01:23:30]  God.  This is just dumb.  Why would you just steal, like, rolls of toilet paper from a restaurant?  Or just go get napkins somewhere.  They always have an extra roll in there.  No, use them for napkins, you know.  Napkins, anything.  Right, right, from a restaurant.  Just whatever.  You could get free toilet paper if you're that desperate.  You didn't watch that show, huh?  No.  I wish I did.  I watched Hoarders last night.  Oh, my God.  Just infuriating.  It was the season premiere, I guess.  And there's just another woman that looks like fucking Ernest Borgnine with a cane. 
[01:24:00]  And she's walking around just, I want to save that.  No, I need that.  You know, try throwing it away.  Try.  Meanwhile, there's workers standing there with their thumbs up their ass because this woman  can't throw away a fucking pie tin.  I don't feel.  I feel good for the workers.  That means time and a half as they wait for this bitch to make a move.  And then Riff Raff, by the way. 
[01:24:30]  What's Riff Raff?  Riff Raff was the guy Norman.  He was also featured.  He looked like Riff Raff.  Okay.  Uh, and, uh, he apparently, uh, uh, had a girl that was living with him in his Hoard  house.  And, um, he went in to check on her and, uh, she was a little unresponsive.  So he called the, uh, ambulance.  They showed up and had to dig through things and push shit over and everything.  And they finally got to her and told him, oh, she's been dead for a while. 
[01:25:00]  Really?  Yeah.  She fucking, he just had a dead person in the house and didn't know it because of his  Hoard.  No.  Who was the person?  That's a major crime.  His girlfriend.  Really?  Yeah.  God.  She deserves it if she tolerated that.  And there's pots and pans.  She's into pots and pans.  She just has so many pots and pans, uh, and won't get rid of them.  Oh, you just want to smack these people. 
[01:25:30]  Philadelphia, huh?  That was Norman.  Norman?  He's the one that had the dead person in the house.  Isn't that ironic?  What was his hoarding thing?  Uh, just everything.  Just everything.  Crap.  He had bottles of, like, Gatorade bottles with his own piss in it.  Why do they always save their own urine?  Oh, they're disgusting messes.  What's the thinking?  What do you do that for?  That's how you should talk to them.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  You gotta handle them with kid gloves.  Sick of it.  You wouldn't handle them with kid gloves?  I would completely cut them out of my life. 
[01:26:00]  What, what, I would just go, cause I've been on a, I told you a roll of taking people out  of my fucking phone.  You fucking crazy bitches.  Out of the phone.  That's how these people should be handled.  Out of the phone.  Yeah.  I know we go backwards a lot on the show, but that's because of a delay.  And I apologize for that, but there's no way around it.  Yeah.  Uh, someone brought up a good point about the, uh, and we'll go back to hoarders certainly,  and we'll do the Dick Clark.  Don't worry.  We're professionals.  It all makes sense in the end.  Uh, the used toilet paper lady.  Yeah.  Someone makes a great point that we should have. 
[01:26:30]  It probably costs more money to wash this stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's gotta buy fucking detergent unless she doesn't.  Detergent, water, energy.  She's just hot water.  So, so that, it's gotta be bullshit.  And then someone says they know the lady.  Oh, really?  And know it's bullshit.  No way.  So, let me, let's try this.  I mean, it might be, uh.  Well, I called it bullshit.  Denise in Jersey, what do you got on this?  Quickly.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  No, I don't know the lady.  I just know it's bullshit.  Think about it.  If you're gonna recycle these things, you gotta use a lot of bleach. 
[01:27:00]  Bleach breaks down fabric.  She's gotta be going through new rags every two, three washes.  Ass rags.  You know what it is?  It's everyone.  They want to be a star.  A star.  Yeah, I bet you that was, that just doesn't seem right to me.  I think it's a mental illness, and she thinks she's saving money, but she's not acknowledging  all the money she's using to wash the shit rags.  Her dumb husband.  Yeah.  I think it's, I don't think it's, I think it's based on.  Why is it always mental illness?  Why is it always mental illness?  How about she's just a stupid fucking cunt?  Because, you could be right, Denise, but they always have to have, they always got their 
[01:27:30]  issues, and because nobody in their life just cuts them off.  Here's how you handle people like that.  You cut them off.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  And you immediately remove them from your life permanently.  That's the only way to handle them.  It took a long time, but I don't understand why you have to deal with someone else's mental  illness, where it affects everybody, making their lives worse.  So, why don't you just cut the one person out and save everybody else?  I'm serious.  Watching those hoarders last night, and the mother, that fucking mother, just talking 
[01:28:00]  about all excuses.  Well, it got a little out of hand.  I love when they say their house got a little out of hand, and there's human shit, and just  shit stacked up so high you can't see furniture, walls, nothing.  I want to go with that.  A little out of hand is maybe your sink gets overflowed to the point you can't really turn  the faucet on anymore.  A few too many dishes.  But you get to it eventually.  That's a little out of hand.  A little out of hand.  Not the staircase filled with bags filled with shit. 
[01:28:30]  She was literally sitting in the middle of a room on a chair, surrounded by mountains  of garbage.  Yeah.  And she goes, I've never been the best housekeeper.  Really?  Really?  You're sitting in a load of shit.  Right.  And she's never been the best housekeeper.  One log is very out of hand.  Yes.  Once you have one log of shit on the staircase, things are going to be talking about coffee. 
[01:29:00]  And she had two piece of shit sons, also, that lived in the house.  And they just, they go into their bedrooms, which are just disasters, and lay down and don't  do anything.  And then one of the women that were on the crew asked, hey, you're a grown man, and in  your room, which is full of garbage, you don't have a garbage pail in here or anything?  And he actually said, well, I had one, but I had a big one, but they, you know, the rest 
[01:29:30]  of the people in the house didn't like it, so I got a smaller one, and that wasn't good  enough.  Like, just excuse after excuse after excuse.  It's exhausting.  It was exhausting to watch.  I can't watch that show, you know.  Oh, it was fantastic.  Too close to home.  I feel bad for the me, me, me shit.  The people who are underage, like, the kids I feel bad for, but anybody who's an adult  and tolerates that deserves it.  Literally, they should just be left to die in their own film.  I was watching an episode before the premiere, which did have two teen daughters that were  living in this house and very upset that the house is a wreck. 
[01:30:00]  And I tweeted my thoughts on this.  I think it's very, very easy to bed down a hoarder daughter, because they are just so  needy and wanting of anything that isn't just a disaster like that.  Probably very easy to just get them.  You get them in a clean house.  You know what they would do to you?  And they're freaking out.  You know what they would do to you if you gave them just a clean bathroom with a warm shower  and fresh sheets?  Fresh sheets.  And then other people were talking like, well, their pussy would smell like cat shit. 
[01:30:30]  There's cat shit everywhere.  You think their teeth are in good shape?  You want to kiss a hoarder's daughter?  A hoarder daughter.  Yeah, nobody wants to kiss the mouth of a hoarder.  A hoarder daughter.  I was born a...  Don't call me a hoarder.  Terrible band.  Ugh.  Enough.  Hey.  Oh.  What?  I heard that.  They're terrible.  I love the Pearl Jam.  I hate them.  I like one song and it's not even the one they wrote.  Which one?  To cover a fucking, I believe, in Miracles. 
[01:31:00]  The fart.  I'm sorry.  I'm happy to be back.  That's great.  They're just tiny farts, though.  Why don't you fart like a man?  Because there's so many of them.  They come out in pieces.  They section off.  The hoarder's was good, huh?  Yeah, hoarder's was really good.  And then Intervention after Hoarder's featured probably one of the hottest chicks that have  ever been on Hoarder's, on Intervention.  And she was fucked up. 
[01:31:30]  She thought bugs were crawling on her.  Like she had some like breakouts on her forehead.  And she's like, yeah, they come out of here.  They come.  And she meant it.  Oh, fuck.  And they're chasing her around the house.  And oh, it was great.  Yeah, that's her right there.  I'm just amazed people are still falling for the Intervention crap.  Look at her.  For the TV show.  She's fucking a wreck.  What is she doing?  What kind of drugs?  I think she's fucking shooting up shit.  Oh, wow.  Meth.  She uses meth.  And they just show her like completely fucking losing her mind. 
[01:32:00]  Who these people are.  What was that Hemingway quote?  The world breaks everyone.  Can we go back a little bit?  I just want to see what that Hemingway quote was.  I don't know.  Ask Hemingway.  He's sitting right here to my left.  That beard.  Sam, where's the Hemingway?  I'm shaving today.  Are you?  Why?  No, I'm not.  I want it to be just ugly now.  People are like, you look like an idiot.  Well.  You look like an idiot.  Jesus.  I'm glad that you're concerned. 
[01:32:30]  I'm not growing it to look nice.  Say that to Ulysses S. Grant.  That's true.  Ted Kaczynski was pretty bright.  Oh, okay.  I've got everything from Richard Dreyfuss in Jaws.  Oh.  To Robert Redford in that one fucking movie where he grew the beard.  I forgot the name of her.  Oh, yeah.  Where he was a mountain man.  Fucking got a bunch of others.  Whatever.  Yeah.  That's her?  Yeah, that's her.  God damn it.  She hot.  Yeah.  And then they show pictures of her.  That's her now?  No, no.  They show pictures of her.  That's her.  Holy shit.  She's hot. 
[01:33:00]  Who does she look like?  I'd rescue her.  I don't know.  They show pictures of her.  She's smoking crack.  When she was even younger and before the drugs hit her and shit like that.  Like 20 and stuff.  Who's that pig?  A friend or something.  She should be smoking the crack.  She's fucking sexy.  Yeah, this girl looked really good.  Wow, she still looks good, though.  She's smoking it in front of her mother?  Yeah.  Yeah, because that's what they do.  And her body's banging, too.  Yeah.  She looks at those zits on her and shit.  Should we be playing this audio?  She's playing as bed bugs.  Start over.  I want to hear this. 
[01:33:30]  No, she's just delusional.  Where do we start?  She thinks bugs crawl on her.  I like a good scene where the whole family's fighting.  Oh.  It's great.  I don't know, man.  How to, how...  Dread!  That's my wine!  The environment that Christina lives in is what helps her to remain an addict.  Here you go.  Tired you get.  Yeah, right.  She's agreed to be in a documentary about a dickhead.  I've really got concerns about Christina losing her sanity. 
[01:34:00]  Christina's out of control.  Put knife down.  She's not her, my sister.  She's a different person.  Get out of here!  Christina!  She's wild.  She's not chasing people with knives!  Stop!  It's just something about the pipe.  It makes your brain totally lose it.  There's something a little ScarJo about her face.  Well, I'm not going, period.  Okay, then we need to sit back down again.  Okay, well, yeah, because I'm not going.  Pause.  Go ahead.  Would you deal with this, Jimmy?  No, she, part of it, a part of it is, I mean, I understand as an addict how brutal it is, 
[01:34:30]  but a part of it is she's still in the house and she's a brat.  I would so just deal with this for a little while.  I love crazy girls, but that's kind of way over the top, the drugs and everything.  I would get to the point of sitting in a dumb living room.  Yeah.  And then when she says, like, I'm not doing this and gets up and I would go, all right.  Goodbye.  See ya.  I'm not going to sit here.  I'd be like, all right.  Fuck you.  Take your clothes off.  Go have fun.  Yeah.  And then you see them a year later. 
[01:35:00]  What are you doing?  Same thing.  You missed nothing.  The whole year of my life was better and you've done nothing.  Oh, your life was better?  Oh, yeah.  Frank was better, huh?  I understand you got to care to a point, but.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm just, I'm in recovery, so I kind of get that, but.  Yeah, she is just a fucking disaster.  She's a spoiled brat.  Throwing something in her mother's head.  Just throw the bitch out.  Yeah.  She's smoking crack in the house.  You're enabling her, you sick fucks.  Oh, they all enable her.  Jimmy, let's talk about this for a second.  Because where's, where, at what point do you go, you know what, go do what you're going 
[01:35:30]  to do?  I don't know.  I mean.  As a recovering addict, like, you know what I mean?  I mean, I'm like that immediately.  Like, I try to help people, but I never try to, I'm not Christ.  I don't rescue people.  Not?  No.  I mean, I have to say that because of my reputation.  You're Christ-like.  Of having holes in my hands.  But what, how far would you go if someone you knew close to you had a major problem?  It's hard to say because I don't live with anybody.  So for me, it's easier to tolerate because you're just a crazy friend.  Right.  All of my friends are fucked up. 
[01:36:00]  They're all addicts.  All of them.  But I wouldn't let someone in my house if I knew they were going to steal from me.  I wouldn't let some.  That's just it.  I wouldn't allow somebody to, but I don't have children.  It's easy for me to say because I don't have kids.  When you have kids, it's harder.  When you're married, it's harder.  Sure.  But I understand that those are things I can't comprehend.  So it's easy to pontificate, but I have no kids and no spouse.  Right.  I would probably tolerate a lot more from them than I would from fucking students.  I guess you would have to, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I know my friends are all, you know how embarrassing is to talk to your friends 
[01:36:30]  and they're drunks and they're just loud.  Even that I don't put up with.  Oh, Jimmy.  Actually, I really wasn't thinking.  Awkward.  I really wasn't thinking.  It's kind of awkward in here.  Anthony's never embarrassing because we're always in Anthony's house.  I'm very loud.  Yeah.  No, I get loud.  You are loud and you repeat yourself.  But it's always in your own house.  I don't mind that.  Rah, rah, rah, rah.  Rah, rah, rah, rah.  I want what's coming to me.  It's like Billy Batson.  I'm like Billy Batson.  And that's my party.  His jacuzzi has a balloon tied to it. 
[01:37:00]  Ah, shit.  I mean, at the bar and the club and shit.  People just start getting loud.  Yeah.  Ugh, shut up.  I just don't have a high tolerance just because of what I've been through.  Yeah.  Growing up.  Good.  You shouldn't.  Lunar ticks.  I don't know if that's good or bad though, you know.  It's great.  You think?  Yes.  Absolutely.  I would certainly reach out and try to help someone if they were having a problem.  I would probably sit down for an intervention.  But as soon as they are running toward the window, I would have to just go. 
[01:37:30]  Go ahead.  I'm going to go to the gym.  When I talk to people who won't go, who won't do anything for themselves, they won't go  to fucking like a detox or something.  Them I have very little tolerance for because it's like, you know what the problem is and  you are choosing.  So what do I want to tell you?  Yeah.  I want to follow you around and beg you to get better.  Don't.  And you got some of these assholes in your life that like you try to do the right thing  and help them out and then they turn on you.  Yeah.  That happens.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  Anyway, let's break.  Are you done with Hoarders, Ant?  Because that was a good roll. 
[01:38:00]  That was a good one.  What happened with the dead person?  They arrest a guy or anything?  No.  You could have a dead person in your fucking house?  He didn't know.  He called the ambulance when he thought she was sick.  Right.  But she was dead.  How long did they estimate?  A couple of days.  Wow.  And they did get him on having too much shit in his house, you know, so he had to clean  up or else he was going to be thrown out.  And just the cleanup process, watching them just toil over the smallest little nothing and 
[01:38:30]  sacrificing their family and everything else because they want this control is what it is.  How can they go into your house and make you clean up?  It is an odd thing.  And I've watched enough of these shows where I'm on kind of I'm on the fence on this one.  I mean, it is your house.  But when you're a neighbor and it stinks of cat shit and your property value is going  down, then it's not just your own.  OK, yeah.  If you want to live in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere and live in your own shit, 
[01:39:00]  feel free.  I don't think it's about the property value going down.  I think they go with the health issue.  Yeah, there's a health issue there.  Yeah, right.  Things like that.  They don't give a fuck if the neighbor is being affected property value.  Yeah, yeah.  I think the local government or whatever gets involved with the health issue.  And they do get pissed off.  They're like, oh, who's telling me how I should live my life and my house?  It's like, you're just a fucking mess.  My family is the most important thing to me.  Is it?  The family that left hasn't been to your house in 10 years because you won't fucking throw 
[01:39:30]  away a salsa lid, you dummy.  You should be able to do whatever you want in your own house as long as it doesn't affect  others.  Yeah.  That's a famous thing that you've heard a million times in your life.  But I guess in this case, it becomes a health issue if this is spilling out into your yard  and neighborhood.  Well, if you want to see that episode and some commentary, just put live from the compound  in iTunes.  And that episode just went up this morning. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, cool, man.  Yes.  Bravo.  I like the iTunes now.  Everyone's doing a fucking podcast.  I got to get on that.  Yeah.  Jump on that.  Oh, wait.  I'm on the radio.  No.  I know.  I can't motivate myself.  All right.  We have a radio show.  This is our podcast.  This is our big podcast.  Let's just start calling it a podcast and then we don't have to do individual podcasts.  Yes.  It's the opening of the name Jimmy Podcast.  Because I guess it's cool to just say podcast now.  Podcast.  Our own Sam Roberts, he kind of got me re-motivated.  I wanted to get on iTunes for a while and it just was very not easy. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's not something where you just upload it like you do anything else.  There's that RSS bullshit.  You got to submit it.  Submit it and they got proved something.  I don't know.  Anyway, I finally got some help from the hippo juice people.  Sure.  And, you know, walked me through it.  Now it's a piece of cake.  So it's up.  Those of us in the podcast community can relate.  Podcast community. 
[01:41:00]  Yes.  The podcast community.  Let's just do our podcast here, man.  This is our podcast.  It's a good podcast.  None.  Have you heard the, has anyone heard the Comedy Cellar one yet?  That dad's a fucking, I haven't heard that one.  That's a good one.  I heard.  Have you done it yet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I was listening to, uh, to Voss's and Voss and Bonnie's, which is hilarious.  It's really good.  And then, uh, goddamn Bill Burr has a funny ass one.  He was doing a Christmas one, a post Christmas, uh, podcast.  Really funny.  Um, and of course, Bobby Kelly. 
[01:41:30]  I did Bob Kelly.  Yeah.  Let's fucking promote that one.  Bobby.  Yeah.  Bobby.  I did Bobby's, uh, first podcast of the new year.  How did they get it?  I don't even know.  iTunes.  iTunes.  Just go to iTunes.  Bobby's on iTunes.  Yeah.  Everyone's on the iTunes.  What's the name of his podcast?  You know what, dude?  Yeah.  Y-T-K-U-Y-K-W-G.  I'm sure if you just search Bob Kelly.  Yeah, there's plenty of ways to search it.  Are they free?  Robert Kelly on Twitter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had free.  Riotcast.com.  I had fun because it's just an easy hour.  Yeah, that's just it.  You do an hour.  You do an hour. 
[01:42:00]  See, but the difference, mine is video also.  Yeah, that's exciting.  So I add those visual elements of maybe a TV show that we're watching to comment on.  Maybe just some shenanigans and chicanery.  And you know what you can do to listen to the video podcast in the car?  Sorry.  I apologize.  Yes, sir.  What can you do?  You just play the video on your phone and plug it into your car, but just don't watch the video.  That's what people are asking me.  They're like, I saw it on Twitter.  Someone goes, Anthony, is it video or are you going to also do audio?  I go, well, if you download the video and if you don't look at it, it's called audio. 
[01:42:30]  Right.  And that's it.  So don't worry about it.  Speaking of video, I did a video with Joe DeRosa.  Oh, yeah.  I love this.  And you get to see the debut of the beard.  Ah, is that the first time the beard makes an appearance?  Yeah, yeah.  It has its own Twitter account and everything.  Oh, Opie's beard.  No, I don't know.  Now it will now.  I've seen Opie's V on Twitter.  I don't have a fucking V.  I gave five pounds for the holidays. 
[01:43:00]  Five pounds, probably all in the cock.  First video of the year.  That V's got to lead somewhere.  Sure does.  My head just got bigger.  You know what I love about our radio show?  It's becoming one big plug for everything else we do.  Oh.  Oh, I was number five.  I'm number four now.  Oh, boy.  Not good.  Yeah.  Number one video comedy.  My first video of the new year is So Much for Health with Joe DeRosa.  And you get to see my stupid, ugly beard.  That's exciting.  Go to my YouTube channel.  Yeah.  Hey, oh, another thing. 
[01:43:30]  Somebody was on Twitter from a website from years ago that just used to try to give us shit.  Yeah.  And was, again, trying to give me shit.  And I just blocked them.  Yeah.  But I went to that website and looked.  Five active members.  I'm not kidding.  I think I'm not going to say it.  It was, yep, that one.  Which one?  Yes.  I'm not going to say it out loud.  Which one?  I won't say it out loud either. 
[01:44:00]  No way.  Hold on.  Why give them any fucking attention?  It really is horrendous.  It's like, and they're still trying to push it as, like, something.  Oh, really?  They thought they knew what they were doing.  It's like, yeah, yeah.  Look at that.  Bunch of cunts.  And nobody who runs, and people could say they don't care how many people are there.  No.  Nobody wants to be in a five-person online community.  Message boards are done.  They're dead.  They're dead.  There's no reason for them now with Twitter and your own, like, blog sites and things like that. 
[01:44:30]  And so websites, these guys are still there trying to bash people, but no one except the five people that are part of that.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  That was before.  It is really bad.  What are you pushing out today?  I can't help it.  I apologize.  It is so bad today.  I think the cottage cheese is wreaking havoc on my sister.  Not just wreaking havoc.  It's just wreaking.  You get to see Joe DeRose's iPhone cover.  What is he doing?  Why doesn't he fucking turn it the right way in landscape? 
[01:45:00]  He's an idiot.  He filmed the whole video on portrait.  Now I'm doing two-camera phone shoots.  Does that make sense?  Two-camera phone instead of two-camera shoots?  Yeah.  Two.  I used his footage.  You're like Desi Arnaz with an iPhone.  He filmed me.  Or something.  But see, I hold my phone the right way, you idiot's landscape.  Everyone knows landscape.  Joe DeRose goes portrait, and then he has a dumb, it looks like he's holding a cassette tape.  But can't you just turn it?  Can't you just turn it?  Like, this should be a button you hit which just turns the whole fucking video. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, but once the video's made in portrait mode, it's cut off.  You know?  The sides are cut off.  It doesn't exist.  Well, how about you just turn it so it's black?  That's all.  Meaning that there's black bars.  What happened?  It should be able to...  You can turn the video.  Well, you should have just done it right the first time.  Yeah, do it right.  Just hold the camera sideways.  Oh, fudge.  And a lot of you out there, because everyone's doing their shit, they send me videos.  It's in portrait mode.  It sucks.  I don't retweet any of those.  Terrible.  Why would you?  Fucking hold it in landscape. 
[01:46:00]  Awful people.  Why do they do that?  Awful.  They're cocksuckers.  Ugh.  They're cocksuckers.  All right, now that we all promoted our...  We all self-promoted our...  Our side projects.  Our side deals.  Not me.  Our side pieces.  I have no side pieces to promote.  You're the king of...  I mean, today.  You've got your act.  Yeah.  That's what you do.  I have nothing.  You do your podcast live on stage.  Ugh.  Just fucking believe me.  I am finished.  No.  No, Jimmy.  I'm okay with it.  I'm finished.  No.  Gee.  No, we're counting on you. 
[01:46:30]  Ugh, boy.  Are you fucking betting on a dead horse?  You really...  You...  I...  They're really...  I'm right now on the track, and they're actually coming out.  The other comedians are coming out with a tarp.  Oh, no.  You have a single gunshot?  Oof.  Oh, by the way, also, Live from the Compound is in HD now.  Ooh.  Whoa.  H-D.  Wow.  Yes, I picked up a new TriCaster unit.  Damn it.  It looks amazing.  I gotta say.  My videos are now in 3D.  What?  3D!  My eye of smell-o-vision. 
[01:47:00]  Whoa!  Fuck!  I'm waiting for Jimmy to come over.  All right, we still haven't played the Dick Clark album.  Oh, Dick.  So we'll do that after these messages.  Nappy do you.  The Opie and Anthony Show, on Sirius XM.  Hey, now, this is Dio Hughley.  Hey, this is Brewery.  Hey, everybody, it's Joel McHale.  Hi, this is Jim Jeffries.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  See you're driving around town with a girl I love. 
[01:47:30]  And I'm like, fuck you.  I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough.  I'm like, fuck you.  Gonna miss Bobo.  He did some great stuff for the show.  Oh, yeah.  Gonna have to get a tribute together.  I heard he died over the time we were gone?  Yeah, I was actually, I didn't, you know,  I didn't talk to Kurt Lovey, his boyfriend.  But, um, boyfriend, Kurt Love.  But I saw it on MSNBC, of all places. 
[01:48:00]  How did the Kurt Love boyfriend thing start?  Was he the guy that drove him home from FH Riley's that time?  And they've been friends ever since?  Yeah, they just hit it off.  Yeah, he drove him home one time, and he just hit it off.  What's going on?  I want to be part of this.  I'm just, I'm cracking up against it.  What is this nonsense with this retard?  Sam, Sam, out of all of us, could keep a straight face the longest. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  And just watching him.  They don't know who Kurt Love is.  I know.  Just some random guy that out of nowhere we started saying it was Bobo's boyfriend.  Bobo's boyfriend.  Doesn't even make sense to anyone listening.  I don't have a boyfriend.  I don't have a boyfriend.  Yeah, but rest in peace, we grieve differently.  So it's true?  I saw it on MSNBC.  I heard it from you on Twitter.  I just retweeted what I heard.  I heard that Bobo passed.  I know as much as we hate him, he did some good stuff for the show. 
[01:49:00]  So I figured, fuck, that kind of sucks, I guess.  That's all I knew.  I mean, I didn't actually see the MSNBC clip, but somebody screencapped from MSNBC.  Oh, so it's got to be real, then.  It's the news.  Sam's literally crying.  Sam is literally crying.  Are you still busted up about it?  Yeah, it's sad.  You do realize that we've been on the radio two and a half hours, and we had a lot of funny  stuff so far.  Oh, yeah.  But you haven't laughed once.  At Kurt Love.  He's laughing at Kurt Love. 
[01:49:30]  This fucking creep hasn't laughed once, and now he's crying he's laughing so hard over  a dumb throwaway line.  It is just throwaway, because you're just starting a rumor about somebody who nobody knows who it  is.  It's just taking a person.  Exactly.  And this is their whole public identity.  Like, the only thing anybody knows about Kurt Love is they've heard his name mentioned  in reference to being Bobo's significant other.  Oh, so it's like a gay friendship?  Yeah.  No, they're dating.  Kurt Love's dating Bobo?  Well, they were.  They were.  Like, Bobo leaves behind Kurt Love. 
[01:50:00]  He leaves behind Kurt Love.  He's survived by Kurt Love.  Exactly.  Wow.  Survived by Kurt Love.  Did Kurt Love try to jump in the coffin at the funeral?  He was really emotional.  No, I've heard.  I don't know.  Try to get right inside that coffin with Bobo?  Oh, yeah.  All I know is, was there some type of message?  What message?  Yeah.  Oh.  What are you talking about?  There was somebody pretending to be Bobo.  Oh.  Left a message to Kurt Love, man.  Oh, that's cruel.  I don't know about this.  Wait, we have the message? 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's, let's, hold on.  So Bobo died over the holiday.  Yes.  Yes.  And he's been in love with Kurt Love, and Kurt Love's been in love with him for some time  now.  And he's survived by Kurt Love.  Yes.  His boyfriend.  Yes.  Okay.  Someone.  But now what?  Played a cruel trick, I guess.  Yeah.  And imitated Bobo and called him.  Yes.  No, he called, yeah, he called Bobo's lover, Kurt Love.  His former.  What did he die of?  Yeah, what did Bobo die of? 
[01:51:00]  I don't know.  I just saw the screen cap from MSNBC that said he had passed on.  Why would MSNBC pick up that story?  I know we're a celebrity.  Because we're a big radio show, I guess.  Yeah.  Oh, and he's kind of known for the show.  Oh, okay.  I mean, remember when he used to call and he would say, you know, everybody noticed me  at the Mets game.  Right.  His neighbors recognized him.  Yeah.  So where does the fake Bobo come into this little play?  I don't know.  Someone's just being an asshole.  So someone's being an asshole trying to claim that Bobo didn't die.  Yeah.  And that MSNBC had it wrong?  Yeah.  I'm so confused.  I don't know. 
[01:51:30]  Well, are they covering it on Howard's show?  Because I know he's been doing Howard's show, I guess, right?  Oh, yeah, right.  That's true.  Yeah, that's another one I saw the screen grabs from.  What did he say?  Oh, yeah, that's real.  Fuck.  Breaking news.  There's the MSNBC screen cap.  Nation mourning the death of celebrity Daniel Bobo Curlin.  Radio star.  Fuck.  See, if you look in the right corner, it says MSNBC.  Right.  It's right there.  It says it.  File photo.  That's obviously real.  File photo. 
[01:52:00]  So at this point, I was under an umbrella.  Yes.  So at this point, I got to assume that Bobo's gone.  Well, why would MSNBC report?  I mean, they report.  You decide.  So does the fake Bobo sound like how Bobo sounded?  Yeah.  But I mean, you know, Bobo impressions are so easy to do.  Can we hear this?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear this.  Sad.  Oh, you want to play it today?  I think he's queuing you.  Oh, this?  Is this going to be...  Play it.  Well, you got to start at the beginning. 
[01:52:30]  Oh.  This is, uh...  Kurt Love.  Fake Bobo.  See, I guess Kurt Love wanted to get back at the fake Bobo, so he decided to put this voicemail  left for him on YouTube for everybody to...  Oh, okay.  That makes sense.  Because this is, again, Bobo's lover.  Kurt Love.  Right.  Okay.  His lover.  Well, hello, Jeff.  It's me, Bobo.  Somebody, uh...  On MS...  Someone must have told MSNBC that why.  That I'm dead.  So damn well, I'm not dead. 
[01:53:00]  You damn well.  Something's wrong.  I need a phone number to MSNBC.  Somebody better get me their phone number,  because I'm going to have a word with them.  I'm going to get whoever televised that lie without me fired.  I will go after the person who televised that lie and believe that lie.  Ugh.  It ain't going to be pretty.  There's going to be some punches.  I'm going after that guy. 
[01:53:30]  Whoever did this.  If it's that asshole cunt bitch, Jordan,  or that fat fuck door to D-Rock.  Oh, shit.  So damn.  I ain't going to...  There's going to be some hurting going on.  Yeah.  I can't find out who did this.  Right.  Please call me back.  Let me get a chance. 
[01:54:00]  Let me get a chance.  Then he just moans at the end of the call.  Just like the real Bobo used to do.  My favorite part is he goes,  I'm going to have a word with dumb.  With dumb.  With dumb.  It's just draining.  They're having a word with dumb.  It's draining.  It really is.  It's draining.  That's the only word for it.  It is draining.  But let's be honest.  That's a pretty good impression of Bobo.  Yeah.  I'll give it to that guy.  That's why it upset Kurt Love so much. 
[01:54:30]  He thought the love of his life was gone forever.  Love of his life.  And now this impersonator is just toying with him.  Yeah.  Everyone's saying that's a good Bobo.  Oh, well.  Well.  My thoughts taste wrong.  Yeah.  We'll get like a tribute together.  Thoughts and prayers.  What do you want to give him?  Five minutes?  If not.  We don't have that much stuff.  Three minute tribute?  Hello.  E-Rock's got a good 45 seconds.  You got 45 seconds, E-Rock? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Let me see if I...  Oh, you know what?  We can just play When He Broke Characters, the fuchsia.  Fucking favorite one ever.  I wonder if that fake Bobo will call our show.  That'll be creepy.  I think that would just be insulting.  I'd be able to break that guy down.  It's morbid.  Do we have anybody on the phone now?  Looks like one of those lines is going.  Do we have anyone on the phone now?  No, I don't think so. 
[01:55:30]  Oh.  Have the audio if you'd like.  Should we do our Bobo tribute now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the Bobo tribute?  In memoriam.  That everyone's been waiting for?  Yeah.  Especially Kurt Luff.  All right.  The Bobo tribute, finally.  A fugitive.  Can I ask you, what borough of New York do you live in now?  No.  I live in Queens.  What's happening, fugitive? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, what happened?  Fugitive?  No, nothing.  I actually, the dog had just walked a little bit too.  The dog walked a little bit too.  Fuck you!  That is so fucking funny because it's absolutely honest.  And that's it.  That dolt couldn't even stay in character.  What a dummy.  But that's...  There you go, though.  There's the tribute.  That's the tribute.  He'll be missed.  Never forget.  Yeah, who's going to sit in the front and fucking wreck my shows? 
[01:56:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Who's going to bring loud women to my shows from now on?  Oh, he would do that.  Jimmy is disgusted.  All right.  Let's play some Dick Clark audio.  What happened?  Sam, we can't mourn forever.  You're right.  You're right.  Why is Sam crying again?  Now what? 
[01:57:00]  Because...  I don't know.  I don't know why.  Wait, what did you just say?  I said because Bobo is just going to flip out now.  Why is he going to flip out?  He's dead.  From heaven, of course.  From heaven or hell.  Or so I'm here.  Why hasn't the fake Bobo called in?  Huh?  I don't get why fake Bobo hasn't called in.  Out of respect to Kurt Lowe.  Oh, Bobo.  Oh, Bobo.  Hey, Bobo. 
[01:57:30]  All right, look.  Look, Bobo.  Bobo.  I don't appreciate you imitating Bobo, someone that was very special to this radio show who  has now passed.  Have some respect.  Right.  Have some respect for the dead, sir.  No, it really is me.  I really am a lie.  No, you do a great impression.  That's a good impression.  But...  But who is this?  Yeah, you've captured his absolute idiocy already.  No, it really is.  It really is me.  Bobo.  It can't be you because MSNBC reported Bobo's death. 
[01:58:00]  I saw it on the news.  I also saw it on CNN and Fox News.  So...  No, I saw it.  There was nothing there about me on any of those news.  I saw it.  We all saw it.  Are you saying that I didn't see it?  I looked at every news show.  Fake Bobo, what are you trying to do here, really?  What are you trying to do?  This is just sick.  Now I'm still alive.  Well, yeah, you are because you're doing the impression of Bobo, whoever you are. 
[01:58:30]  Of course you are.  No, I really am Bobo.  We saw Bobo laying in a casket, so we know he's dead.  No, there was not a rape.  Yes, we know.  There was not.  You did not see my mom.  Yes, I'm looking at a picture of it right now.  Prove that you're really Bobo, then.  Go ahead.  I really am Bobo.  I live in Mass Effect Queens.  Everyone knows that.  Everyone knows that, so anyone can call with that information.  My mom's name is Aurora.  We know that, too.  We know that. 
[01:59:00]  It's been talked about.  Bobo mentioned all this stuff during his numerous appearances.  What's your dog's name?  No, two dogs.  Rosie and Mr. Maloney.  Oh, you just fucked up.  Yeah.  You paused way too long in between the question and the answer.  You know what?  I'm not talking to this fucking fraud anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's great.  Apparently, before his demise, someone told Bobo to wait outside his house holding a sign  with his name on it and that they were going to drive by and take him to the Giants game. 
[01:59:30]  What?  What happened?  I don't get it.  Somebody actually told Bobo, Bobo, go outside your house, hold up a sign that says Danny,  because his name is Daniel, of course, Bobo, and we're going to send a car for you, and  that's how the car driver's going to recognize you, to pick you up and take you to the Giants  game.  He stood out there for how long?  I don't know.  I was too busy mourning.  Hours.  There were hours between tweets. 
[02:00:00]  Hours on end.  And then when he finally realized he wasn't getting picked up for the game, what did he  tweet?  You do it, Trevor.  Got screwed again.  That is the cruelest thing to do.  Who would do that to a retard?  It's the cruelest thing.  Proven once again, they don't get what we do.  But fake Bobo, why are you calling back?  It really is me, right?  I feel like I did get screwed over that.  Hold on a minute.  Who's this also on the line? 
[02:00:30]  This is Bobo.  Oh, see?  It's another guy doing Bobo.  See what I'm saying here, people?  I'm the real Bobo.  This guy is lying.  Well, he sounds like Bobo.  See, everyone is trying to do the fake Bobo now.  See, he's the fake Bobo.  I'm the real Bobo.  Yeah, I think this guy sounds better.  Which one do you want to pick as the new Bobo, now that the real Bobo's gone in?  I'm the real Bobo.  No, I like the other guy.  That guy sounds good.  Yeah, I like that guy.  This guy's lying. 
[02:01:00]  Ah, see?  He says that to a T.  I'm not lying.  Nah.  No, you're lying.  I'm not lying.  You're lying.  Fobo's too over the top.  Yeah, Fobo.  I like this real Bobo guy.  The other guy's a little more subtle with his impression.  I would do anything for the show.  No, I would do anything for the show.  Ah, see?  No, I know that's...  He says lying.  What?  Fake Bobo?  Is it a positive?  I know that's Jordan.  What?  He's lying.  He's lying. 
[02:01:30]  I know that's Jordan.  Like to kill everybody that's even imitating Bobo at this point.  I'm not Jordan.  I'm Bobo.  Yeah, I kind of like that guy.  Maybe we use him as the new Bobo.  Yeah, he'll be the new Bobo.  No, I really am.  I know that really.  No, we all know that Bobo...  It's pretty obvious that Bobo's passed.  But the character's so good, we really should get a new Bobo.  Jesus.  Ah, stop it.  I feel a little Bobo.  This guy's lying.  Hold on, man.  It really is.  I really am.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  How many times do you fall for the same fucking thing? 
[02:02:00]  Tommy.  Wait, Jimmy, we got another Bobo, though.  What?  We have Bobo number...  We have fake Bobo.  We got real Bobo number one.  Now we got real Bobo number two.  Real Bobo number two?  Hello, I'm not lying.  I'm Bobo.  That's great.  That's him.  Harvey Bobostein.  That sounds just like him. 
[02:02:30]  It sure does.  Meet the match.  Well, let's go with Bobo number three.  Bobo number three.  Yes.  You're Bobo?  I'm Bobo.  Wow, that's pretty good, too.  These guys are good.  They sound just like him, more so than that first guy.  I feel better that we could replace the character now.  Yeah.  We got some good ones to choose from.  It was only a name.  Yeah, I know.  No, I really am still alive.  No, you're not, you liar.  I'm alive. 
[02:03:00]  You're the Bobo.  No, no, no, I am still alive.  Let's go with Bobo number four.  Bobo number four.  Hey, boys, it's Bobo.  I'm from Jersey.  Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow.  I remember when he did that.  Oh, he's doing the Bruce Springsteen impression.  Oh, shit.  That's just like how the original Bobo did it.  Not bad.  Before he died.  Yes.  All right, fake Bobo.  Anything else you want to say before we say goodbye to you?  Say the same thing you've been saying for 20 minutes.  Go ahead.  Again.  No, no, no.  You're alive for repeated. 
[02:03:30]  I really am still alive.  Right, I really am.  Ah!  Oh, it's raining.  Why did I not know you would tell you?  How every time does it happen?  And I felt victim to that damn scam last Sunday.  What kind of dummy stands outside with a sign waiting for an anonymous person to get them  for the Giants game?  No.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  I think it's fake Bobo, the burp. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, every time.  So, fake Bobo, what do you want to say?  I didn't hear you.  I don't know if I could trust anybody that says they got giant tickets.  Yeah, I mean, why wouldn't you?  That sounds like a really smart deal that somebody would give away $300 tickets or whatever  to some blithering idiot in Queens.  I don't know if I could even trust my own friends.  What friends?  Oh, believe me, there's lots of them.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, there's others.  And it's not just any people that listen to this show.  Fake Bobo, thank you.  I can't trust anybody.  Fake Bobo, thank you.  We've got to move on.  Yes, fake Bobo, come on.  I will admit that...  I really would do anything for playoffs.  Fake Bobo, thank you.  I will admit that the impression is right on.  So, we'll give you that much today.  Yes, Fobo.  I really am a fool.  Bye.  Bye.  Just training. 
[02:05:00]  Impossible.  There's eight more Bobos on the line.  It just never changes.  His same droning bullshit.  Just dumb.  I don't think you could train him to work at McDonald's.  No.  No.  No.  He would ask every customer for Giants playoff tickets.  Yeah, he'll be a burden to whoever has to care for him for the rest of his life.  Well, I mean, he's dead though.  Well, that's true.  No, he says he's alive, but I'm more confused now than when we started. 
[02:05:30]  Kurt Love's okay with this, though?  No.  Being his boyfriend and all.  Boyfriend, lover.  Lover.  Everything.  You know, they are each other's everything.  His lover.  Kurt Love.  It's just nonsense.  No one knows who Kurt Love is.  Do you think that's why his name's Kurt Love?  I don't...  Yes.  Yeah, his last name is Zbobo.  Zbobo. 
[02:06:00]  Zbobo.  Yeah.  Pretty funny.  What a dolt.  Fuck him.  Giants tickets stands out with a fucking sign.  What a dope.  Just go buy tickets.  Who does that to a retarded guy?  Well, that's true. 
[02:06:30]  Who's worse?  I'm more mad at that.  Tell me you are the fucking...  You need to know the truth.  It's like, you gotta know your fucking limits.  You can't even let him have a home life.  You just have to constantly fuck with him.  Oh, I know we abused the shit out of him, but fuck.  Not in the afternoon, though.  It's cruel as fuck, but just to think of it and put it together and have it work, that's  pretty good.  You gotta...  But why it's cruel is he's not even doing it, like, for an audience.  He just did it.  No, just to fuck with him.  Just to be a dick.  How did you get the picture of him with the sign? 
[02:07:00]  He Twittered it because he had to prove to the guy that he was outside.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  I thought it was a good idea.  Yeah.  Just kidding.  Oh, fantastic.  We have a video response.  Is there something else here?  Or is this...  Or we did the whole thing?  No.  Oh, that's...  We haven't done that yet.  Oh, it was a YouTube channel.  Of course.  I forgot.  What?  Well...  Oh.  I mean, you're not the only one with a YouTube channel. 
[02:07:30]  So he has a video response?  Of course he does.  So what?  Why wouldn't he?  The courts of his death.  Wait.  So...  He's trying to tell the world he's not dead and he made a video?  Is that what's going on here, Sam?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  God.  Hi, everybody.  This is Daniel Bova Curlin.  You all know me from the Opium Anthropocene show.  You all know him.  And I'm in right now in...  Nyack.  Out of all those places in Nyack, out of all places, probably not a place you'd expect to 
[02:08:00]  find Bova.  I just haven't been...  Not a place you'd expect to find Bova.  Bova, Bova, Bova.  I know you...  You can't even say his name.  I know you think it's impossible, but Jimmy actually bites his own teeth.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've never seen...  It's mind-boggling.  He...  Jimmy...  I've never seen a face like the one Jimmy makes when he's really annoyed.  Jim's not alone.  This video has four likes and 24 dislikes.  No one would expect to fight Bova.  What got you, Jimmy? 
[02:08:30]  Just the whole thing with this fucking idiocy.  Like how he's trying to prove that he's alive, but he has to sidestep that and talk about  how you might not expect to find Bova in my hand.  I enjoy him sometimes.  Well, you know what?  I expect Bova to be in that part of the world.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  I wouldn't expect that either.  You wouldn't expect that?  No.  No?  No?  No?  No.  Yeah, I mean, that's a car ride away from Queens.  I know.  So you don't expect him to be a car ride away from... 
[02:09:00]  A car ride?  No.  Who would expect to fight Bova?  Yeah.  In the next town.  You know where I would be surprised to see him on a college campus?  High school graduation line.  Employed.  Yes.  All right.  Well, here's the video of him trying to prove to everyone he's alive.  I'm still not buying it.  A place is probably not a place you'd expect to find Bova.  Bova.  I just haven't been visiting here.  But I'd like to let you guys all know.  There's been rumors around me that I'm dead. 
[02:09:30]  Guess what, assholes?  I ain't dead.  I'm alive.  Well, and that's right, this dummy is still alive, and I'm still like to wreak havoc.  And I know there is somebody who made up a lie that I'm dead.  And if I find out who made up that lie, if I find out who it is, the name of that person, that guy will get his ass kicked and will be sued to the highest extent of the law. 
[02:10:00]  So, I will beat his ass any way I can beat him up.  I'm allowed to beat him up.  Anyway, I want him to regret he lied about my death.  He will regret that lie.  I will make sure.  And if I have to, I will make, if it's possible, I want that guy raped by a black man.  Jesus.  So, fuck you, whoever believes this lie. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, you paused.  Okay.  I thought it was that one.  Oh, I know.  It looked like it was, like, another fucking hour.  The way Sam has it, it looked like it was 40 more minutes of this blithering idiot thing.  Just babbling and rambling about nothing.  Nothing, self, as usual.  So, I guess that person, I don't know, whatever.  It's all very confusing.  Yeah.  I guess what's not confusing is Kurt loves his boyfriend. 
[02:11:00]  That's the only thing we know for sure.  We know that for sure.  Kurt Love is just a listener to the show.  Yeah.  Who happens to be, or he was, or he is, whether Bobo's dead or not, I don't even know at this point.  Yeah.  But regardless, the love of Bobo's life is Kurt Love and vice versa.  And that we know for sure.  Yes.  Okay.  They have or had a passionate sexual relationship.  Oh, wow.  All right.  At least we know that.  It's a fact.  Did he actually say he's going to reach havoc?  Okay.  Yeah.  Reach havoc. 
[02:11:30]  I thought I heard that.  He's a tall guy.  You're going to be sued to the highest extent of the law.  Of course.  And he's only going to beat the person to the point where it's still legal, did he say?  And if possible, he'll be raped by a black man.  Right.  Yeah.  If possible.  According to Snopes, that video is fake.  Oh, wow.  Snopes checking in.  Yep.  Dopes.  Dopes.  Dopes.  And Will in Houston writes, I think Bon Jovi handled the death rumor better.  My favorite part is looking at Jimmy. 
[02:12:00]  Jimmy's eating his face.  I'm just, he's just a fucking idiot.  I can't even have mercy on someone who just falls to the same thing every time.  Every time.  Every time.  You mean if I plunked him down right now, he would do the same shit?  There's no way.  No.  Fake Bobo.  Yeah, this is actual Bobo. 
[02:12:30]  Actual.  What do you want to tell the world?  No.  Tell me.  What do you want to tell the world?  You know what?  I ain't going to say anything about this rumor, all right?  I already know it's fake, all right?  Not according to Snopes.  Yeah, Snopes is saying that the video is fake.  Well, the thing is, I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think  What do you want to tell the world, fake Bobo?  You as anyone else.  All right.  Just mumbling and not getting to it. 
[02:13:00]  What?  Get to it.  It drives me, fucking drives me nuts.  I apologize.  Oh, it's just a chore.  Because you're asking him a question.  What do you want to say?  Will you stop fucking starting over?  Just say it once.  It really is a chore.  I apologize because I think I'd do it just to see your reaction.  Oh, I'm trying to be crazy.  I think that's the only reason I do this.  Because it drives you nuts.  Oh, he's just an idiot.  He falls for it every time.  I'm like, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck. 
[02:13:30]  It's the worst.  Oh.  God bless.  Yeah.  Godspeed.  Godspeed.  Bobo.  Daniel Bobo Curlin.  Why didn't he take Kurt Love's name?  Bobo Love.  Bobo Love.  Or was Kurt Love supposed to take Bobo's name?  Kurt Love.  They switch.  They're switch hitters, I've heard.  Would he do a Daniel Bobo Curlin hyphen love? 
[02:14:00]  That would be good if he hyphenates.  Then he would be Kurt Love Curlin, which is true and his name.  Yes.  Right.  It's so inside.  Yeah.  And that's what makes you laugh?  That it's so inside?  It's so ridiculously inside.  And that's, well, why does that make you laugh?  Because it's just like, there's no reason to take someone as nondescript as Kurt Love and 
[02:14:30]  to just drag them through the mud for no reason except for your own personal amusement.  Right.  Because no one else.  No one even knows who he is.  Everybody just goes, why is he saying Kurt Love?  I don't understand.  I don't get that.  How long does the snow fall on this video for?  That's what I want to...  I just turned it on.  It's a YouTube filter.  I want to see.  Oh, it's going down now.  Why don't we take a break and finally do the Dick Clark audio?  Yes.  God.  Wow.  It's 9 o'clock already. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  We should go home early, I think.  Start the new year nice.  Just to, you know...  He's got a week and a half off.  I'm not a jump into the pool kind of guy.  I like wetting my foot a little bit in the water and getting the temperature.  I've seen you jump into pools.  Well, only when they're heated very nicely and home.  Oh, I think we could all agree we want to do this nice.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice and easy.  Nice and slow.  See?  That's right.  That's the way to do it.  All right.  Finally, the Dick Clark audio next. 
[02:15:30]  Please.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Jimmy has left the show, I guess.  I guess he has something to do for a minute or two. 
[02:16:00]  But this is what we have to do.  Yes.  Dick Clark.  Oh, yeah.  Dick Clark.  Dick Clark.  He did his New Year's Rockin' Eve.  Him and Ryan Seacrest, who's doing the heavy lifting now.  But always, always paying tribute during the entire evening to Dick Clark kissing his ass  and making it seem like he really has anything to do with this New Year's Rockin' Eve.  You said that Ryan Seacrest is doing the heavy lifting. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Well, for what?  There's nothing to do.  Exactly.  And they take themselves so seriously.  Yes.  Like, they're changing the world.  It's the easiest gig.  Yeah.  How do you get the Ryan Seacrest gig?  He fell right into it, didn't he?  But he doesn't do anything clever.  Doesn't do anything creative.  Nothing.  Remember when there were two hosts to American Idol?  Yeah.  Two of those guys?  Whatever happened to the other guy?  Whatever happened to the other guy?  Ryan Dunkelman?  Oh, God.  Andrew Ridgely.  But how do you get that gig? 
[02:17:00]  I don't know.  We're too ugly for that gig, I think.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think you've got to look kind of...  You've got to look kind of...  I almost said you've got to look hot.  You've got to look kind of human.  You've got to look kind of, you know, the part, I guess.  There they are, the two American Idol guys together.  You know that Ryan Seacrest makes just millions upon millions of dollars,  and I don't even know what he does.  Apparently, he's got a radio show.  Yeah, but it's a boring radio show.  Yeah.  But it's syndicated.  It's syndicated.  Yeah, how does a boring radio show get syndicated?  Post to American Idol. 
[02:17:30]  We're a good radio show, really good radio show.  We were syndicated, and we couldn't get an audience like he has.  So what?  You just got to...  Because we didn't appeal to the masses.  And how do you do that?  By being boring?  Yeah, by being milquetoast.  I don't get it.  He has that, and he took over American Top 40 from Casey Kasem.  Casey Kasem.  And then he's Dick Clark's guy.  He's got the Dick Clark, the Casey Kasem.  He's taking over all those old radio guys.  And he knocked out Rick Dees for the morning show on the Kiss FM.  When does he start doing Wolfman Jack's voice? 
[02:18:00]  But what does he do?  He bees Ryan Seacrest.  Someone explain.  He produces the Cardassian show.  Oh, right.  That's another thing I just don't understand.  So all these people that I don't understand get together and make boatloads of money.  Huge cake.  Like, if you sat down a Ryan Seacrest fan, what would they say?  Yeah.  Why?  Why do you like the guy?  Well, maybe he acts like one of their friends. 
[02:18:30]  No, he doesn't.  That's the Carol Miller line.  Oh, sorry.  We're their friends here on Debbie-Doo, Eddie Debbie-Doo.  God, we made so many more friends than she ever did, too.  Oh, boy.  She was trying to tell everyone that she's friends to the listeners.  Really?  And you had more friends?  Oh, way more.  Because the listeners listen to me, it's like, why do they listen to you?  You just play music.  Why would you be any different than anyone else?  Because I'm their friend.  Really?  Would you let them over your house? 
[02:19:00]  The weird part is that's what we were accomplishing.  Yeah.  By drinking with everybody.  Making dopey friends.  Doing all these live broadcasts.  The dub-a-doo-ity-dub-a-doo.  Dub-a-doo-doo-boo-ba-ba-ba-ba.  She's still around.  Yeah.  Wow.  She works here, I think, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  How you doing?  Another one, though.  What does she do?  She sits in the jock prep area over in the hallway here by herself.  What is she prepping for?  She's a rock jock.  What do those dumb jocks prep for?  Oh, God.  I know what's the latest going on with the bands that are on classic rock stations. 
[02:19:30]  The latest?  I have no problem with Carol Miller.  I got to stress that every time I beat her up because I really, I'm past this.  Yeah.  But I never got it, that's all.  I was one of those people.  Even when I was doing it, I'm like, this is horse shit what I'm doing.  Right.  You didn't need a jock prep area?  No.  Jock prep area.  I knew it was horse shit, and I also knew I got to do something different or I'm just  going to leave the business.  Yeah.  But these people still don't think it's horse shit. 
[02:20:00]  We don't even need an office at this point.  No.  Like, we haven't had an office in years.  No.  They have a jock prep area.  We haven't even prepared for this show.  We have to talk for four straight hours.  Ha, ha, ha.  We don't care.  None of this was prepared today.  No.  We just said, fuck it.  Turn on the mics.  Let's see what happens.  Yes.  Who's that?  Carol Miller.  Carol Miller.  Which I don't have a problem with.  I really don't.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, but if you don't have a problem with her, you're just smashing her for no reason,  which is still, that's not going to not hurt her feelings. 
[02:20:30]  I just smash what she is.  That's all.  Not her as a person.  What?  Oh, wait.  No, no, no.  I know what that signal is.  What?  What?  What?  Don't you dare.  Iraq, you got to run the board.  Relax.  Yeah, you got to run the board.  You got to run the board.  I'm going to go talk to Gary.  Yeah, go talk to Gary.  Go talk to Gary.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We got it.  Yeah.  Just run the board, Eric.  Jimmy's, uh, where's he going? 
[02:21:00]  Jimmy is going into the, uh.  The Iraq portion of the studio, which is the control booth.  Jimmy, by the way, has the worst fucking parts today.  Oh, he just let it loose.  I could hear it.  Oh.  Iraq's gagging.  Whoa.  Iraq's gagging.  He's stuck in.  It's a virtual gas chamber, is what Iraq is stuck in. 
[02:21:30]  By the way, how about he stops ruining everything with the lemon pledge?  Oh.  You're ruining the goodness.  Those are bad.  They're pretty bad today.  They're so bad today, Jimmy.  You brought some in with you.  That's intestinal disease.  Wow.  You brought some back in with you.  It followed you in like a fucking, like, lingering ooze.  Garbage can in the door.  Like impending doom.  Sorry.  That's, uh.  You can smell that all the way in the hole. 
[02:22:00]  It's so bad.  But it followed him all the way back.  It did.  It followed him.  I told you.  Like a contrail.  My farts are codependent.  Yeah.  They want to stay with you.  Yeah.  They get homesick for the ass.  Who's that?  Oh, jeez.  Kenny.  Looks like Sammy Hagar's out there.  Some chick looks like Sammy Hagar.  She's actually cool.  I'm sure she is.  Some fucking chicks that look like Sammy Hagar always have to be.  I'll write down who that is for you.  Okay.  Oh, is it somebody important?  God, yeah, man.  We've talked about that a lot. 
[02:22:30]  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Wow.  Cool.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm still waiting for something that I didn't get, so.  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  Really?  Dick Clark.  Okay, so, uh, Ryan Seacrest intros Dick Clark.  Finally, we get to this point.  Let's go upstairs to the man who we've been celebrating all night long.  He started this party 40 years ago.  Dick Clark.  Dick, happy new year.  Thank you, Ryan.  What a great party.  You know, when we began 40 years ago, I never dreamed our program would become a habit for 
[02:23:00]  minutes year after year after year.  And tonight, it's big and better than ever.  He says that every year.  He says this every fucking year.  You're right, though.  He does sound better.  Does he?  You're right.  Yeah, he does sound better.  He does sound better.  It's a habit.  What is he talking about?  Times Square.  They were doing the Times Square thing way before Dick Clark, and someone decided, you 
[02:23:30]  know what?  We should probably put this on TV.  That's all it is.  Yeah.  And it used to not be just from Times Square.  Really?  Yeah.  The New Year's Rockin' Eve was like in a studio somewhere, and they'd have bands play  and stuff.  It wasn't really all.  Now, it's all in Times Square.  The performances and everything is in Times Square.  Because they figured out how you could do that outside, in front of people.  Yep.  I like Dick Clark, because he broke a lot of rock bands that other guys weren't giving  time to.  He was good to a lot of bands.  I like Dick Clark.  I think he's had an amazing career, but I don't like this. 
[02:24:00]  Like, what are you doing?  Someone close to him has to go, look, just step away, man.  What kind of stroke did he?  Because Patrice had a stroke that just shut him down and ended everything.  But Dick Clark has a stroke.  Like, what, I guess it was a different part of the brain, or did they get him right to  the hospital?  What the fuck happened?  I guess so, yeah.  Yeah.  Like, I would love to have the details of his stroke, like, where he was and what they  did for it.  I think when you have a stroke, you've got to get help immediately is your only chance,  right?  Was it just a different one?  In most cases?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure there's different strokes, too.  Yeah.  I guess that's a question for Dr. Steve. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, the difference depends on how the...  All right, Dick Clark, so here's more Dick Clark.  Oh, he's diabetic.  Okay.  Who?  Dick Clark is?  Yeah, type 2 diabetes.  I didn't know that.  Is that the bad one?  Yeah.  No, I'm serious.  Is that the bad one?  I don't know.  Minor stroke.  You can sit home and feel sorry for yourself.  I hope you don't do that.  Crumpy old fuck.  Well, that's a minor stroke. 
[02:25:00]  You had a minor stroke?  Wow.  I guess so.  Yeah, it must have just hit the speech.  Diabetes.  Maybe just hit the speech.  Maybe his brain is fine and it just hit the speech center.  I don't know.  I'm sure his brain's fine, which makes it just a living hell, I would assume.  But when you look at what a stroke can do, like it ended Patrice's career in life, like  that's not as bad.  Even if he couldn't do his gig, he still fucking could live and hang out with his wife and  eat dinner.  And Dick Clark's life is probably not that much different, just a little slower.  He's got a lot of money.  And he's in his 80s anyway. 
[02:25:30]  He wouldn't exactly be fucking riding a dirt bike anyway at that age.  I think he's 82.  82.  Fuck.  Ah, here's Dick Clark.  Now the man who started this tradition four decades ago is inside, getting ready to count  us down to 2012.  Dick!  Thank you very much, Rock.  You know, we have a whale of a moment for me.  People everywhere have one thing on their mind.  What will Lady Gaga do to entertain the world tonight? 
[02:26:00]  Talk about energy.  Boy, you can feel it in the air.  Yes, you can.  An 80-year-old guy talking about Lady Gaga.  He doesn't even know.  And energy.  Maybe he's totally fine from the stroke, and this is just old age.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not in his 40s.  I mean, he's an old fuck.  Lady Gaga, the energy.  Yeah, we know.  Shut up.  Well, Jenny McCarthy was also on the scene. 
[02:26:30]  She's terrific.  She certainly was.  She's just a terrific fucking lady, man.  She's sexy.  She's funny.  Oh, God.  She made a lot of wacky faces.  I've never seen her do that before.  Yeah.  Oh, I have.  And then who's this cop that's going to get fired for kissing Jenny McCarthy?  You don't think that was set up?  Oh, okay.  You don't think they got permission from the NYPD and they sent one of their boys over?  Of course.  Everything is set up.  Nothing is spontaneous.  I wish they would have sent a fucking, like, an undercover black guy from, like, the narcotics division. 
[02:27:00]  Dressed like a homeless guy.  Fucking, you know.  Just grabs her.  Yeah, he just looks like a fucking criminal, but he's got a badge around him.  So you're like, oh, I guess he's undercover.  Starts tonguing her.  Yeah.  Well, we get to hear how terrific Jenny McCarthy is in this clip.  Congratulations, Dick Clark, for 40 years of bringing in the New Year.  Thank you, VLG.  You know we were back live in New York.  Now, who are the people down there tonight? 
[02:27:30]  Eight out of ten are from out of town.  And many came here from all over the world.  Jenny?  Dick, thank you so much.  I ran into these little cutie patooties.  What's your...  Cutie patooties?  Jimmy's mad.  It's just annoying.  Oh, it really is.  I'm like, oh, come on, Jimmy.  It's just infuriating to hear.  I wonder if they just wanted him to do it to this year, by the way, because it's his 40th. 
[02:28:00]  I wonder if Dick Clark will be done after this because it's the 40th anniversary.  I thought at the end of the broadcast, it seemed like he was heading that way.  Yeah.  What a great moment.  But we'll see you next year.  Yeah, but he said, I'll see you next year.  Well, he has to.  He can't just go, I'm done.  But he should have said, look, this is it for me.  I'm going to give it to Ryan.  It would have been a nice moment.  Thank you, B.I.C.  Jay from Huntington.  Who the fuck is Mady Dada?  Mady Dada. 
[02:28:30]  Jesus.  This is network TV.  It just blows my mind.  Yeah.  We can't get shit done on TV.  And this guy, 82 with a stroke, talking about Lady Gaga.  That's just normal.  Part of me thinks it's commendable that he does it.  Like, hey, you know what?  We can't be so shallow that we don't look beyond that.  He's still capable and he's still doing it.  He's not capable.  No, no, but I'm saying he's still talking and the show is getting done.  And then there's the other part of me that says, look, fucking move on. 
[02:29:00]  Let it go.  Give it to somebody else.  But then it's like, well, what's more important?  He's not even giving it to anyone else just on camera.  He still owns the show.  Maybe that's inspirational to other people.  Like, maybe people who are fucking older or have had health issues look at him as like,  well, fuck it.  Look, Dick Clark's still gone.  I don't know.  But 80-year-olds aren't watching Rockin' New Year's Eve.  No, but I mean.  Watching Lady Gaga.  Younger people.  Bieber.  Everything.  Let it be.  Let it be. 
[02:29:30]  Terrible.  Terrible.  Thin-voiced little wimp.  Terrible.  Whole world's insane.  Justin Bieber is massively huge.  Ryan Seacrest is massively huge and doesn't do anything.  Dick Clark has a stroke at 82 years old.  He's on TV and we're fucking back here.  Here's, everything is amazing.  The one word is amazing.  I like that.  Amazing.  Just what Dick Clark is, Dick. 
[02:30:00]  Thank you, Ryan.  Now, look at that picture above me.  I don't care where you live.  You won't find anything like it anywhere on the earth.  But 40 years later, I still find it amazing.  Ryan?  They just, like, they kiss his ass, kiss his ass, throw it to him.  He says, like, a couple of sentences and then, right?  The over-the-top kissing of his ass is really uncomfortable. 
[02:30:30]  It's embarrassing.  Let's back up to the man that got this all started.  It was the year zero.  No one knew what to do year after year.  And he's the one that decided to start counting them.  What?  Did you see the Dick Clark montage, but they left out the stroke years?  Oh, did they?  But, you forget.  He was the world's youngest teenager.  You got the montage?  Oldest teenager?  When was he?  Youngest teenager.  The world's oldest teenager.  What an idiot.  Whatever he is.  All I think of with Dick Clark is fucking Jenny Gump almost throwing herself off a balcony 
[02:31:00]  and then running out while her drug friend fucking falls asleep.  That's how I associate Dick Clark.  With happy thoughts.  Yeah.  Here's the countdown.  Dick, you've done this for the last 40 years.  Please take it away.  Count us down to the new year.  All right.  And now, the big moment.  We're waiting for it.  We're waiting for it.  We're going to roll the cards. 
[02:31:30]  We're going to move back on.  They are going to remember to life forever.  Or the 40th time.  Let's count down.  17, 60, 50, 14, 15, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,  5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  He got New Year out that time, I think.  He got it.  He got Happy New Year. 
[02:32:00]  I hate it when he had to rush the, you know, 7, and then they're on 2.  He's like, 5, 4, 3, 2.  Yeah, yeah.  He was getting a little backed up there.  Might be a little too inside, but you can hear the engineer, like, turning up the crowd noise.  Yeah.  They're trying to drown him out.  Let him go.  I'm like, come on, Dick.  I think the way they do it is, I've heard from somebody who works it, that there's somebody  under the desk, and when they want him to speed it up, they poke his legs with pins.  That's the signal for speed it up.  You're flubbing it.  It's like, what tells you it's time to speed it up, Dick? 
[02:32:30]  The million people who are two numbers ahead of you?  Hurry up, motherfucker.  Get to it.  Wow, Jimmy.  What?  I'm sorry.  You are shooting an odor out of your ass.  I'm trying not to.  A kin to a skunk.  I apologize.  It is so incredibly bad.  I don't mean it to be.  I'm so happy to be back.  I can't not acknowledge it, is what it is.  Wow.  Wow, dude.  I can't not acknowledge it.  I'll try not to.  Now it's sour.  I've been trying not to.  It's so bad.  Holy fuck. 
[02:33:00]  Wow.  All this talk about Dick Clark just gets to me.  Sam, we better go home.  A hoarder's house.  We've got to clean up the studio for Ron and Fez.  We better get out of here.  We've got to air it out.  Yeah, we've got to air it out.  Open up some windows, which we can't do, so we better leave.  You've been back from vacation for three hours.  Three hours and five minutes.  That's a long time.  Maybe.  Sort of.  We need to, you know, regroup.  No.  You had a chance to regroup, and you didn't.  Dick Clark not paying attention.  Hey, Dick!  Boy, boy. 
[02:33:30]  What a man.  Everybody came to have a good time, and are they ever having one?  You did a great job of throwing the party.  Here's what bugs me.  Here's what bugs me.  He's just saying obvious shit.  Yeah.  Smiles are better than frowns.  It's like, I know that, Dick.  How about you add something to it?  He's so basic now, he can only say obvious things.  These people are happy. 
[02:34:00]  No shit.  Fucking quiet.  Honeydew Wilkins from Oklahoma City.  He writes, did he say tits teen?  Tits.  Hot.  Tits teen.  Then again, would I rather watch him bumbling through the countdown or fucking perfect, I  like her, but perfect Ryan Seacrest.  Who the fuck wants?  He's not interesting.  No.  No.  They're all watching because, you know, it's a sideshow on TV.  It's the only reason they're getting a massive rating. 
[02:34:30]  Here.  It hits big and more fun every year.  Ryan?  It does indeed.  Look.  It does indeed.  Here's why they're doing it with Dick Clark.  Because they think that he's such a habit.  People will watch him.  What do you do?  Yeah, you watch Dick Clark.  Put Dick Clark on New Year's Eve.  Yeah.  The minute he's gone, then you're competing with Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin and all  these other fucking people who your whole life wasn't spent watching. 
[02:35:00]  Why is it so important who gets the ratings on that night?  It's the same as any other night.  It's money.  I mean, that's why.  But most people are out at parties, so they're not really even paying attention to the TV.  But they're all watching the countdown somewhere.  It's on, yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone's watching the countdown somewhere.  I'm just wondering if you're an advertiser, yeah, you're getting big numbers, but you  want to know that people are going to watch your commercial.  But if everyone's in a room just partying, are they really watching the advertisers?  I don't know.  I mean...  It's like anything else.  Are you ever watching the commercials? 
[02:35:30]  But that show is usually on in the background of everybody's party.  So, you know.  All right.  And they figure that Dick Clark is the one we've all been watching.  Yeah.  So, it's just the one you think of.  It's kind of when you know it's time to like, oh, it's New Year's, you know.  Let's fucking count it down.  Maybe he doesn't want to do it.  Maybe he's like, oh, look, I want to retire.  I've had a stroke.  I'd like to settle down.  And they have photographs of him, like, fucking jerking off with B.B. King somewhere in 1966.  They're behind a dumpster somewhere, just fucking tugging each other's dicks. 
[02:36:00]  I would love to think that's true.  I would love that, too.  Electric.  Pitbull said it.  Amazing.  Dick.  Dick.  Thank you very much, Ron.  You know, we had another great new year.  People are looking to the future with hope and with will.  And not too long from now, they will call the people, sweep up everything, and time straddle 
[02:36:30]  with it fine by morning.  But for right now, what a night to remember.  Brian?  You said it.  And right on time there.  I love how uncomfortable, right?  He has no idea.  He's starting to talk until Dick says his name.  No, I say, right?  You said something, Dick.  Apparently.  Yeah, it's obviously set up something where Dick Clark has to say Ryan when he's done.  I love the band.  Because how would you know when he's done?  Right.  He wouldn't. 
[02:37:00]  He probably gets interrupted all the time in his personal life.  He's in the middle of a story.  People are like, all right, I guess he's finished.  Yeah.  It sounds like he might be finished.  Oh, wait.  Every fucking, I hate the banter they do.  Like where Dick teases the youngster and Ryan pretends to be good-natured instead of  really taking off the gloves.  Hardy har har.  And finally this.  Now we have a lot more entertainment for you.  Come out, so don't call it that yet.  I hope I have a healthy and happy new year from the bottom of my heart. 
[02:37:30]  Now, I am marking my 40th year.  Ryan is about 34 years behind me.  That's not bad.  There's a long way to go.  You know, to come the theory, 40 years ago, you weren't even born.  Yes.  And the first year I was born, I was this height.  The same year.  Yeah.  This height. 
[02:38:00]  I haven't grown much.  Did you ever do that?  Yeah, I did.  It was fantastic.  And by the way.  I never saw so many people.  Yes, you did last year, motherfucker.  Oh, God.  We're changed for nothing.  It's pretty much the exact same thing every year.  Same thing.  You have seen that many people.  It doesn't seem different.  The only thing that's different is the year.  The only thing he could say, I've never seen a two, a zero, a one, and a two in a row.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's what he should say.  I don't know why this bothers me so much. 
[02:38:30]  I don't know why it bothers me.  It shouldn't bother me.  Because Dick Clark's a smart guy.  But Ryan bothers me, too.  Well, he's just, because he has an ability to do what we don't do.  He has an ability to be that, and then he has a great career because of it.  I wish I could do that.  I wish I could go, uh, indeed!  No way.  And I was handsome and people liked me.  Fuck no, man.  I wish a lot.  First couple years of my radio career, I did that shit.  You go home at night and you don't feel good about yourself.  No.  I go home at night now and I don't feel good about myself.  I don't give a shit. 
[02:39:00]  But I mean, but to have to fake it just to get a big audience?  Fuck that.  Yeah, take the money and run.  You think?  You'd be able to do a Ryan Seacrest thing?  Oh, absolutely.  Wow, I wouldn't be able to do that.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  No problem.  No problem.  Get me in there.  Hey, Dick!  Hey!  Fantastic, Dick!  Hey, I don't know why you're here.  Hey, where's Ryan?  And you would bite your lip?  Oh, yeah.  Knowing that you'd want to just make fun of it? 
[02:39:30]  No, I wouldn't even bite my lip.  I could totally get myself in that zone.  Wow, good for you.  Oh, no problem.  I'd get caught off camera once.  There's no way I could do it.  I'd get caught with the audio running when I wouldn't know.  Here's how I would be wrecked.  I would do a great job on camera.  I'd be fucking Gary Grovel.  Well, good point, Dick!  You know?  And as soon as, like, he was talking, I wouldn't realize my mic is on.  Yeah.  And I'd say something, not even over the top, just like, I'm right already.  I fucking heard you.  What? 
[02:40:00]  Have him removed from the premises.  How many more years of this?  Something like that would bleed through.  Yeah, maybe.  Did Jim Seacrest say how many more years of this shit?  Did that go over?  Because he was on seven?  That's great.  Yeah, so.  Too many people.  Incredible.  Why do you keep feeling good with all the people?  I was going to tell you, we ran upstairs, and the crew.  How great is there playing the cancer music behind Dick Clark, by the way?  We all know that as the cancer music.  Oh, yeah, the cancer music. 
[02:40:30]  They use it in what?  ER.  Yeah.  They've used it a couple different times, I believe.  Anytime they need an obese Hawaiian to sing a song.  Every time someone is on their way out, they like to pull out that number.  Yeah, yeah.  I was going to tell you, we ran upstairs, and the crew and I are sweating.  Do you have a fan?  One year, one year from now, any year, I'm waiting for the temperature to drop.  Good-natured fun.  Dick is hoping it's really cold in Times Square one year. 
[02:41:00]  I hate the fun ribbing.  This is good-natured, though, Jimmy.  Remember, you're Jimmy Seacrest.  Jimmy Seacrest.  Anthony, remember, you would do that.  Oh, I would do that in a second.  You would have to make fun of how warm it is to Dick Clark, because he's been out there in the war zone.  Hey, Dick, I'm lucky I'm down there, and it's not too cold.  It's not too cold.  I remember years back, you down there in the snow.  Please extol upon us one of your humorous anecdotes about the snow and the cold, Dick. 
[02:41:30]  That's endearing.  Man, I remember the snow.  You're coming down harder than I've ever been there before.  Anthony?  Talk more.  I'm busy.  But you said you wouldn't.  You would go with it.  Oh, I would.  You would go with it.  I'd be like, yeah, Dick, oh, boy, we sure are getting lucky, all of us out here.  You know, Lady Gaga's barely wearing anything.  It's a good thing it's warm out there, right?  No, you did it.  You could see her clitoring through her meertards. 
[02:42:00]  You could do some good-natured ribbing about the weather, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, I would fucking shoot myself.  I'd do it in a second, because I'd go home and just fucking...  You'd really do it.  Be like, ah, build another wing on the house.  Buy more guns.  Any year, I'm waiting for the temperature to drop.  So I can't speak, right?  What a special night.  Incredible to look back at all the matters.  Go back there in a second.  That was awkward. 
[02:42:30]  Whoa.  That was awkward.  Who said...  That was Ryan saying, so I can't speak or something?  So now you're going to make believe that he speaks perfectly?  This guy sucks.  No, I think he slipped.  Huh?  No, he's talking about how, you know, when it's cold out, you can't talk as well.  Yeah, I know, but you shouldn't probably bring that up.  No.  No, you don't understand.  In their world, Dick Clark doesn't have any problem whatsoever.  See, if you're going to be Ryan Seacrest, but that's what they...  He doesn't honestly think that. 
[02:43:00]  Yes, he does.  No, Ryan doesn't.  For the gig.  For the gig.  But in real life, that's a very awkward thing he just said.  That's what I'm getting at.  So you have to go home and realize that you just sold your soul.  But it's not being...  That's right.  Ryan Seacrest right there is making the whole world know that Dick Clark is fine.  Nope.  Let me hear it again.  Nope.  I don't know.  Is that selling your soul?  Like, I don't...  There's honesty and there's integrity.  And then there's, all right, the guy's doing...  He has a stroke and he's doing a countdown on New Year's Eve. 
[02:43:30]  Do I call him out?  You can't really call him out.  What are you going to say?  I understand that.  But, I mean, Ryan is trying so hard and so over the top to make everyone believe, look,  this is just fine and normal.  And he's probably just waiting for him to trip and fucking break his neck and stop already.  All right.  Listen again.  What a special night.  Incredible to look back at all the memories, too.  Oh, lovely.  You're such a great friend to me and to the nation.  What happened?  You wanted to hear that one part, right?  Every time there's a thump in the studio, Ryan probably goes, did Dick fall? 
[02:44:00]  This might be...  If he hears anything, there's like a little glitch.  Wait, did Dick fall down the steps?  He's got trip wires set up all over.  With fucking boxes and nails.  Bad lighting everywhere.  Bad lighting.  He probably takes on half the light bulbs in the studio.  Fucking, he snips his shoelaces.  One year from now, any year, I'm waiting for the temperature to drop.  So I can't speak, right?  What a special night.  Incredible to look back at all the memories, too. 
[02:44:30]  That was awkward.  You're such a great friend to me and to the nation watching.  Thank you for everything.  Thank you very much.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year.  Dick Clark.  So I can't speak.  So I can't speak.  That's a great day.  It's a weather day, so I can't speak.  Yeah, but it's still awkward.  And he felt comfortable to say that because he really is making everyone believe that everything  is fine.  No, there was some uncomfortable silence that happened right after he said it.  So he realized, oh, fuck.  Yeah, I think so.  So that was a glimpse of what he's really thinking.  Or, no, just kind of a slip. 
[02:45:00]  It was a slip.  But it's like, put it this way.  It's like when my good friend, Bill Shatner, was here in the studio.  And I was talking about the compound.  And I said, ah, and Bill, I have a pool.  And his wife drowned in the pool.  And after I said that, I felt all weird.  I got hot.  And I was sweating.  And it was very uncomfortable.  So there's the slip.  See, it's just a slip.  And you don't notice until after it happens.  And then you just try to make believe it didn't happen. 
[02:45:30]  But you could hear.  But you know, there's like an uncomfortable moment.  Like when he started sobbing.  Man.  There's a man on the wing.  There's a wife in the pool.  He's a friend of the show.  He doesn't care at this point.  He's got a new one.  There's a man wearing a hoodie footy on the wing.  A man wearing a fuzzy hoodie footy on the wing.  Worst costume ever.  Great episode, though.  Great episode.  What was the worst costume?  The man on the wing on Nightmare at 20,000 Feet with Bill Shatner. 
[02:46:00]  Can you try that a little bit, Sam?  In there.  I can't see it.  It was a pretty bad costume from the Twilight Zone.  That looks good.  That looks kind of real.  Hair's cool.  Yeah.  He was in a big bunny suit, it looked like.  It's like he's in poison.  And let me tell you something.  If the wife in that episode wanted to help the husband out, she would have sat by the window and looked out the window the entire time.  Because here's what happened.  It either would have shown itself, and then the wife would have went, holy fuck, you're not crazy. 
[02:46:30]  I saw the thing, too.  Or it never would have showed itself again, and then they wouldn't have to worry about it ripping the cowling off the engine.  And then they would have landed, and everything would have been fine.  Oof, that is terrible.  Yeah.  It is a hoodie footy footy.  That is really funny.  It's a man with a hoodie footy on the wing.  God, I should have laughed the first time.  I haven't seen that episode.  I know.  Now that I see the picture.  I was tweeting as we all watched it together.  That's really funny.  Somebody said, Anthony, you know, Twilight Zone's available on Netflix and everything. 
[02:47:00]  You're watching a marathon with commercials and everything.  It's the whole communal thing of those marathons, like the Honeymooners and Twilight Zone.  I have all those.  I have them at home.  I can pop it on my Kaleidoscape.  But to watch it and know other people watching the same episode, and then you could tweet  it and fuck around.  Right.  I get it.  Yeah.  More fun that way.  A couple more things about New Year's Eve.  Is it New Year's Eve or New Year's Eve?  I think it's New Year's Eve.  Then you say New Year Resolution.  Happy New Year's Eve. 
[02:47:30]  New Year's Resolution, New Year's Eve.  No, you say New Year Resolution.  No, it's New Year's Resolution.  No.  Because it's the resolution of the New Year, it's possessive.  New Year's.  What's possessive?  The resolution is the New Year's.  Because it belongs to the New Year.  Right.  So it's the New Year's.  That's why there's an apostrophe.  Did you say my New Year's Resolution is?  Yes.  Yes, apostrophe.  No.  Yeah.  Possessive.  I don't accept it.  You'd say Happy New Year.  Happy New Year's Eve. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Because the Eve is of New Year.  It's only not possessive.  There's no apostrophe when it's plural.  Oh.  Like if I say.  English.  Like this subject sucks.  There's an S at the end of it, but that's not possessive.  No, it's not possessive.  That's a weird example.  By the way, I did like your William Shatner example.  Yes.  But let's not forget Sam's example.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  That was a fucking big football.  Did you have that, Iraq?  Is this him? 
[02:48:30]  Big football.  Yes, there he is.  Yes, he is.  Okay.  He's coming in.  I can hear his voice.  Adam Walsh.  Hi, John.  How are you?  What did I say?  Hi, John.  How are you?  Oh, my God.  I'm an idiot.  How are you?  You can't just say after you do that, oh, my God.  I'm an idiot.  What else am I going to say?  Jimmy just trying so hard to cover it up.  Hi, John.  How are you, John?  Hi, John.  John.  How are you, John?  John.  Welcome, John with a J and O and H and N.  I didn't know what to do there.  Oh, who would?  You don't expect someone to be addressed as their murdered son when their whole life has 
[02:49:00]  been spent as a result of that.  Exactly.  You know, you might expect it if it was something that you didn't really know, but he's a celebrity  and everyone knows his son was decapitated.  You don't expect to hear that name used.  Exactly.  If you threw cold water on me, it wouldn't have been as shocking.  Can we hear that one more time?  I didn't mean to cover it so well.  Oh, you are so good. 
[02:49:30]  I'm like the wife whose husband is drunk again.  Yes.  Yes.  Is this him?  No, I don't know.  Yes, there he is.  Yes, he is.  Okay.  He's coming in.  I can hear his voice.  Adam Walsh.  Hi, John.  How are you?  What did I say?  Hi, John.  How are you?  Oh, my God.  I'm an idiot.  How are you?  John, John.  Hi, John.  How are you?  Something about John, John.  Hi, John.  John.  Something about John.  Hi, John.  Are you in the John?  I've been in John with many women.  Hi, John.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, Sam. 
[02:50:00]  For what it's worth, I didn't expect to hear it either.  What?  Just popped that.  It was a surprise to me.  Oh, it was?  Oh, yes.  That's great, though.  I love it.  Adam Walsh.  And Cigars and Scotch writes, the man on the wing looked like Don Imus.  Oh, my God.  His hair.  His wing is hideous.  Going to poke around the engine for a while.  I'll see if I can dig out some wires and whatnot.  Who's looking at me through the window? 
[02:50:30]  Is that Bill Shatner?  You stupid idiot.  Is that the man on Mars, too?  The face on Mars?  Go back to those pictures, Sam.  There's one with the man on the wing.  Right?  No.  Down.  Down.  Down.  Down.  No, it's still the man on the wing.  Down.  I'm going to see.  Is that a mockery of the face on Mars?  Oh, no.  I don't think so.  Second one on top before I spit on you.  No.  No.  Down.  Yeah.  There you go.  No, that's just the man on the wing.  Wow.  That's Don Imus.  Very good.  Cigars and Scotch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just out here on the wing.  It's driving this guy crazy and stuff. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  It is Tuesday, right?  Yeah.  It certainly is.  Cigars and Scotch with the two for Tuesday.  Oh.  Two in a row.  Ready for the second line?  Two.  Usually people say, hi, John, to Jimmy.  Exactly.  That's funny.  That's a thinking man's line.  Very good.  It's good.  A couple things about New Year's Eve.  Lady Gaga.  Quick clip from her here where she has to make everything she does profound. 
[02:51:30]  Here's an example.  To say that I love this city is an understatement.  This is my hometown and my dream.  I'm going to marry the night.  I won't give up on my life.  It's her dream to be in Times Square for New Year's Eve, I guess.  Oh.  What a great song. 
[02:52:00]  I don't.  It's funny.  I don't really listen to that song.  I usually go to the third one, which is Judas on that record.  What song is that?  This is gay talk, by the way.  Marry the Night.  Most sexual.  But Marry the Night's the first song, I think, was a government hooker.  But I like, I actually am liking that, just hearing that moment of it.  I love her live.  Everything, cock should be falling out of the ceiling onto my face as I'm talking.  Like asbestos, they should be tumbling onto my face.  Yes.  I got the Blu-ray for Christmas.  What?  Lady Gaga's live show.  How is it?  It's fantastic.  I wouldn't mind getting that.  It's the same one I went to at the garden. 
[02:52:30]  I'm sorry to see.  When is she coming around again?  I don't know.  I'd go see her again.  She's great.  You're less gay if you're Blu-ray for Christmas.  Blu-ray.  Get it?  Do you get it?  I do.  You can blow me.  You got it.  You got it.  I got it.  You got that one?  That time I got it.  Oh God, the man in the window, the man, the fucking twat wife is just fat. 
[02:53:00]  She's fast asleep.  How do you sleep when your husband is just making such a spectacle of himself?  I know.  And the wife had a perfect cockhead hairdo.  It looks like a fucking helmet.  It's a mushroom.  Yeah, she has the cockhead hairdo.  And he's like, look, hurry.  There's a man out there.  A man on the way.  What a genius Rod Serling was, though.  Yeah.  Like that stuff is still, a lot of it's still creepy 50 years later.  Fuck yeah.  It's good writing.  Not a black person to be found in the Twilight Zone.  Yeah.  My God.  It was, uh... 
[02:53:30]  It was one, though.  Wasn't Brock Peters in it?  No?  Yeah.  I don't know.  None of that stuff.  It's a...  Wow.  Why didn't they go with black people?  I don't know.  They didn't just back in those days.  Back in those days.  Yeah.  Ah, man.  There were black people on TV.  Blacks would just get on TV.  What year was the Twilight Zone at?  TV, 55, 60.  But they had mammies on the big screen, so, well, why didn't they have mammies in the  Twilight Zone?  Eh, I don't know.  I'm thinking there's something to that.  Were there none?  No black people?  Willoughby, there wasn't a black conductor on the train or anything. 
[02:54:00]  Willoughby was just, you know, a bunch of old people.  Well, dead people.  Is that what they were?  I don't want to spoil it.  I love the fucking one where they...  Stepped off the train.  They're all on the train set.  They see the giant shadow, but they're all just train set people.  Do you remember that one where they're on a train, they just keep seeing this weird  shadow, or whatever they are.  They're in a town.  It's, oh, the little, uh...  Oh, yeah.  That's the little, the couple, they get drunk, and they end up waking up, and they're in a 
[02:54:30]  house, in bed somewhere, and they're trying to figure out what they did the night before.  And it turns out that they just play toys for a giant kid.  And they hop on a train at one point to get out of the little dumb town.  And the dummies, they close the blinds.  And it's like, wouldn't you leave it open and see where the fuck you were?  Look out the window and see until you see a sign that you recognize?  And then they just go around, and they open the window when the train stops, and they're  back at the same place they started, because the train just went around in a circle.  How great is that? 
[02:55:00]  Why are they brilliant, brilliant guys?  They fucked up a great franchise, man, because they could have made a million of these movies.  Mm, yeah.  You could have.  When it was all hot.  The bad third eye.  That one, I was laughing that the diner had two aliens in it, but not one black person  would be found in the diner.  It was a guy from Mars, a guy from Venus, not a black man to be found in that diner.  How to serve people?  Yeah.  How to serve.  It was to serve man.  To serve man.  How to serve people would have been a little more of a giveaway that it was a menu or a 
[02:55:30]  cookbook.  What was it called?  To serve man.  It's a cookbook!  And then a big nine-foot alien traps him on the thing and pushes it up.  I always said it was the canimids, and I think I tweeted that.  The canimid head guy looked like he had those dark, dreamy, E-Rock eyes.  Look at him right there.  Yeah.  Look at that one.  He's got the dreamy E-Rock.  And he's got E-Rock's new hair, too. 
[02:56:00]  And then someone said he's also got E-Rock's appetite.  He's eating people.  It was really fun.  It was hours of tweeting Twilight Zones.  That's some good writing.  It was a lot of fun, man.  But the black thing, that's suspicious.  I wonder what's going on.  I don't know.  Rod Serling had no use for him, I guess.  We got a Kathy Griffin clip from New Year's Eve.  She decided that she needed to be in her bra at one point.  Why? 
[02:56:30]  This is CNN.  Hubba, hubba.  Oh, hubba.  And then you got Anderson Cooper, who has to make believe, I guess.  Well, he has to make believe a lot of things, I guess.  Oh, was he fibbing?  Was Anderson Cooper maybe telling a fib?  There's a lot of make-believing going on.  A lot of make-believe?  One being that Kathy Griffin is hot in a sexual way.  Oh, that could be make-believe in many ways.  But then you have to make-believe the other thing to start with.  Which is what? 
[02:57:00]  I don't know.  I ain't saying it, because certainly no one else is out there.  No.  For whatever reason.  For whatever reason.  But here's how the clip went down.  Kathy Griffin with LeBron.  We're very excited here.  We're going to be bringing you all the festivities here.  Oh, my Lord.  What, are you kidding me?  We just saw Lady Gaga.  Are you kidding me?  We just saw Lady Gaga, and I just thought, why?  I swear, I'm literally talking to you guys, and I turn around.  Why can't we do a block rhyme in my underwear?  Where's the sign? 
[02:57:30]  Where's the sign?  It's not nude.  I have, look at it.  Jeez, look at the, no, look at the sign.  Oh, Jesus.  Good Lord.  Seriously.  Lady Gaga's performance is over, and I was inspired.  You've got a rocking body, by the way.  By the way, my microphone is off.  Oh.  She does have a good body, though.  She's probably 50.  But let me add something.  Yeah.  If a girl's over at the compound, let's say, in your single days, and all of a sudden she's  got a bra on, would you tell her that she has a rocking body? 
[02:58:00]  You got a rocking body.  Let me tell you.  Rocking.  Would you?  No.  No?  I wouldn't tell her she has a rocking body.  A rocking body.  Is that what Anderson Cooper says to girls?  That they have rocking bodies.  Yeah.  You've got a rocking body, by the way.  By the way, my microphone is off and everything.  I don't even know what's happening.  I'm assuming it's the crucial break, or we're going live to Hong Kong.  I love how you're just, like, standing here, like, as if. 
[02:58:30]  I'm just, like, grimping, and I'm completely dressed.  Oh, goodness.  What banter they have.  What chemistry right there between Anderson Cooper and the naked or semi-clad Kathy Griffin.  It works.  A lot of people like it.  Do they?  Do they?  Yeah.  I don't mind that as much as the whole Dick Clark thing.  Oh, Pat from Monaki is saying, we misheard that.  He said, you have a rotten body.  A rotten body.  Oh, Pat.  Pat was tweeting like a maniac over the vacation. 
[02:59:00]  Yes.  A lot of Pat from Monaki tweets.  Did he get stuck?  His foot fell through the trailer floor?  No.  His rotted floor?  He is very funny, man.  He's hilarious.  He's got some great tweets, and he, anytime he reminds me that he lives near the fucking  runway of the airport, it just conjures an image.  He knows how to paint a picture in 140 characters.  Why doesn't he do stand-up?  I'm not saying it's easy, but I mean, like.  Because of his feet. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, exactly.  At least do open, try some open mics.  Yeah, or do something with writing.  He's a good writer.  I'm not downplaying it, obviously.  It's an open wound night.  It seems like he has some natural ability.  He should do some fucking, uh, some open micers.  Or Steve and Bayshore should be writing.  These are both very funny guys, and they're not, either one of them are not.  And they're doing shit with their lives.  Yeah, both of them are just basically, as we're saying, human garbage.  Yeah.  No, I think they're both funny dudes, and Pat should perform, or at least write.  Steve would rather, what, paint houses, I guess?  I don't know what he'd rather do.  Just look at his big, dumb feet. 
[03:00:00]  Adopt cats and fix his things.  Is he a cat person?  Is he married?  Uh, he's a cat person.  I know that much.  And he's not married?  I don't know yes or no.  I don't want to blow up anybody's stuff.  Oh, okay.  I have no idea.  I know his history.  Does he like pussy?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay, good.  Oh, he likes it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he does.  Mm-hmm.  Likes memorabilia from the era.  Mm-hmm.  I know that.  And he likes to paint shit.  I hope he's caught in a gay scandal with a Jewish fella, and he has to explain it with  all his Nazi friends.  No, no, I was trying to, like, get it on the inside to get some information. 
[03:00:30]  For what?  Suck it out of his bag.  Oh, look who's in the chat here.  Kurt Love.  Oh, God.  Kurt Love's back.  Is he sad?  I don't know what he's laughing about.  He should be very sad.  Yeah, he should be.  All right.  Kurt, listen to the replay, Kurt.  You really took up bashing.  Sterling did hire a lot of black guys at the time.  Oh, okay.  According to Justin.  What?  But they weren't on film.  They weren't on TV.  I didn't see them. 
[03:01:00]  One more thing to do today.  Brock Lesnar.  Oh, man.  He got his ass fucking handed to him.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Who was the guy that was fighting him?  Alistair Overeem.  Yeah.  He was a heavyweight.  Let me tell you something.  He knew exactly what the fuck to do to Brock Lesnar to make him fall down.  Lesnar come back too soon, Jimmy?  No, it was a year.  No, no.  He was fine.  The thing was this.  If they got on the ground, Overeem would have had a hard time because Lesnar's so strong. 
[03:01:30]  He's a good wrestler.  But fucking Overeem.  Not only was he the Strikeforce champion, he's a kickboxing champion from, I think, 2010.  And stand-up-wise, he's probably the best heavyweight striker.  He's deadly.  It just looked painful.  Fuck, man.  Answer me this.  Why would he retire?  Why wouldn't he give it one more shot?  Because I think that's his first fight in a while.  In a year.  But he had 12 inches of colon removed.  And personally, I think he's going back to WWE.  And I think because A, they offered him a lot of money.  And B, it's just less punishing.  Overeem kneed him six times. 
[03:02:00]  Like, big kickboxer knees.  And then, did you see the kick that ended his fucking...  He kicked him in the liver.  And Brock backed up and then, like, went, oh.  Just like Chester.  Yeah.  Apparently, Brock took a stake off his...  Could you show the kick, Tim?  Do we have that?  What happened, Brock?  Brock seems to be hurt.  I don't understand.  They're doing stand-up. 
[03:02:30]  They're stand-up.  They're doing stand-up.  Yes.  Stress factory?  What's up with his ear?  He's kneeing him.  I guess he got cut.  Yeah.  This kick.  Oh, man.  That's a knee in the body.  Big knee.  He's hurting Brock.  He's against the cage.  And then he just...  He tried standing up.  That's it.  They let it go for a while, too. 
[03:03:00]  No, he's covering up.  He was covering up, but they knew he wasn't doing anything.  He was hurting, man.  He was done.  Lester Overeem has defeated Brock Lester.  Overeem has a face like a bad guy in a movie who just wins the fight.  Yeah, yeah.  The cocky.  Yeah.  He kicked him.  Everything he kicked, it was right in his guts, right in the part where you know he has problems.  Right where the surgery was.  Brock was...  Did you see the speech he made? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, we got it right here.  A body kick.  Yeah.  Made him just fucking fall down like a sack of potatoes.  And that's probably as hard as Overeem could kick.  Like, he got kicked in a bad place by a kickboxer.  Hard.  Here's Lesnar.  Lesnar looks a little out of shape there, too, huh?  A bit, yeah.  A little bit.  All right, I'm here with Brock Lesnar.  First of all, Brock, obviously disappointed.  That's a shitty...  I'll get it here.  You got it here?  Okay.  He's an excellent wrestler, Joe.  I got to step up my game.  Okay, here it is.  Joe Rogan going over to Brock Lesnar. 
[03:04:00]  Alistair Overeem, Jr. Dos Santos.  What a striking matchup that will be.  Joe will visit with the former UFC champion.  Brock Lesnar defeated tonight at 226 of the first.  All right, I'm here with Brock Lesnar.  First of all, Brock, obviously you're disappointed.  He's been out of the Octagon for a long time.  Give us your thoughts on the fight and your future in the sport.  My hat's off to Alistair Overeem.  I want to take my hat off to all my training partners, my wife, my family. 
[03:04:30]  I'm wearing a hat.  That's silly.  Take it off.  I've had a really difficult couple of years with my disease.  And I'm going to officially say tonight was the last time you'll see me in the Octagon.  Brock, you had an amazing ride going from no mixed martial arts fights to jumping right in with the best of the best. 
[03:05:00]  If this is your last fight, I want to thank you very much for some great fights inside the Octagon.  I want to thank everybody.  I want to thank the Fertittas, Dana White.  Brock Lesnar is officially retired.  I promised my wife and my kids.  If I won this fight, then I would get a title shot.  And then that one would be my last one.  But if I lost tonight, everybody, you've been great.  Alistair, it's been a pleasure.  Brock? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, get over here.  Hey, we got a pay-per-view to do.  You get over here.  You're working for Vince McMahon.  You're hired.  You're hired.  Yes.  Brock, you think you're seeing that?  You're the wrestling guy.  I mean, there's been rumors out there, Sam.  Yeah, for a long time.  They're probably going to try to pull off the Undertaker, Brock Lesnar.  But probably not until next year's WrestleMania.  They won't do it this year.  Because they already got, I mean.  Aren't there 800 pay-per-views that they could plug them into? 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, but WrestleMania is the big deal.  Because they got The Rock back.  Jericho just came back.  They got enough for this year's WrestleMania.  I heard he's got a lame fucking gimmick, Jericho.  No.  I don't know.  I read it.  Well, he's a friend of the show.  No, he did a lame thing on purpose so that the fans would start cheering him.  And then he didn't say anything, making the fans boo him.  It was brilliant.  I didn't understand because I don't care.  But you asked.  I know.  What made you care? 
[03:06:30]  He had a light-up jacket.  I care.  I asked for the listeners.  I don't care.  Yeah.  I asked for the listeners.  Yeah, he had a light-up jacket.  A light-up jacket.  Sounds fun.  Can we talk about Lesnar for a sec?  That's a bummer.  But he's doing the right thing.  He can't compete with guys like that.  I know, but you got to wonder, you know, what he would have been if he didn't get that disease.  Honestly.  He had a great start.  He did.  But the only guy he really knocked out was Couture.  Not even knocked him out, but really hurt with a punch.  And at one point, Rogan said when they were standing there, he goes, Overeem has no respect for his striking game. 
[03:07:00]  Guys that can hit, like, Dos Santos.  You saw what Kane did to him.  Yeah.  Shane Carlin should have beat him, but just gassed out.  Fucking Velasquez beat him fairly easily.  I think Dos Santos would have beaten him because he's a big puncher.  And Overeem killed him.  I think he would have been in trouble.  Even though he's so strong.  If he was healthy the whole time?  Yeah.  He's a great wrestler, but it's like they know that.  So guys would just avoid being taken down. 
[03:07:30]  Just keep him on his feet.  Keep him on his feet.  He's also 34 years old, so he only had a couple years left.  Yeah.  Regardless.  Yeah.  Overeem's up there, too, though.  He might be 31.  And now he gets to go back to the wrestling and make a shitload of money.  There's millions of dollars to be made if he goes back.  Oh, yeah.  Millions.  Really?  Yeah, definitely.  Even though he lost his last fight?  It doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter, yeah.  He could have lost three fights in a row, doesn't he?  Wrestling will be something different.  Yeah.  He'll just be.  They love him.  I mean, all he does, he doesn't even...  He's talked shit about wrestling.  Like, his book, he was just talking about how much he didn't like it, and he just did 
[03:08:00]  it for the money, but it doesn't matter.  He's so good that...  That stupid Undertaker thing, I bet he fights him now.  I'm sure he will.  They'll make...  He'll make millions off of his one match with the Undertaker.  Yeah.  He's got 240-acre or 40-acre fucking ranch.  He's got some sick amount of land in northern Minnesota.  He's fine.  Yeah.  There was no scar, though, where they took his colon.  Where are they going for your colon?  I guess they're going through your asshole.  Do they?  No.  Or some kind of laparoscopic surgery where they just make a little hole. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, I thought they went in through their stomach.  Oh, no.  Well, they're not going to cut you open like fucking Braveheart.  Why'd they cut him open in Braveheart?  Because he was a very bad boy.  No, no, no.  But what was the...  They cut him open for what?  Oh, they spread him out on that fucking bench, and they wanted him to plead his allegiance  to the king, and they were purifying his soul through pain, and so they would cut him up  alive with these big knives and take his intestines out and pull him and shit like that. 
[03:09:00]  What if he would have just pledged his allegiance?  Then they would have given him a quick death and cut his head off really quickly.  Oh, they still kill him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There's no, you know, stitching him up after that.  And then they do that.  But he, of course, yells out, freedom at the top of his lungs.  I bet you in real life, he was like, all right, the king is fine.  I love the king.  I love the king.  I love the king, please.  Yeah, yeah, king rules.  Come on, my head off.  Yeah, where's the king?  Ow.  Elbow to those kingly ribs, you.  This hurts.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  He probably said, no, I'm dumb.  And somebody would think, I think he said freedom. 
[03:09:30]  No, he didn't.  He said, I'm dumb.  You would say, fuck the king at that point.  As soon as you felt the point of the knife.  No, I praised him.  I mean, I mean.  I love the king.  No, I mean, you would say in your head, like, fuck the king, you know, whatever it takes  to.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Get me the fuck out of this.  When you saw that, like, big hook and knew they were just going to rip his fucking guts  open with it.  It's an amazing scene.  Oh, it's twisted.  It's a good movie.  He lost a fucking racist.  Makes a great fucking.  And speaking of which, he lost a shitload of money. 
[03:10:00]  Oh.  What did he lose?  450 mil?  $450 million.  Because she was in all those movies.  Out of.  She was in all those.  Did he lose a half a billion in the divorce?  He lost half of everything he had.  That's how much he likes new pussy.  How old was he?  Oh, because you had a kid together.  He was with her.  30 years?  For 30 years.  They had seven or something kids together.  Oh, his first wife.  Yeah, yeah.  The real wife.  Oh, that's not the one he argued with.  No, no, no.  Not her.  Oh, okay.  Now, even then, I don't think she deserves half of that fucking thing.  30 years?  All their kids? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  The weird thing is, the wife stood by him when the psycho bitch was all over his case.  Oh, yeah?  And then, in the end, she fucks him way worse.  She was great in the Lethal Weapon films.  Oh, that's right.  I honestly, as much as I hate the way the divorces are done, 30 years and seven kids with somebody?  Well, she deserves money, but not $450 million.  30 years is a long fucking time, man.  Is that what it's all about?  It's about investing your time so that, in the end, you can just get a fuckload of money out of somebody? 
[03:11:00]  I don't understand it.  Seven kids, though.  I'm saying, that's legitimate partnership.  Give her a million for each year.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm serious.  30 million?  That's fine.  You can't live off 30 million?  A million a year to be with me.  That still would be, he would still save $420 million.  Yep.  Exactly.  A million a year.  That sounds good.  You live off that.  That doesn't sound outrageous.  Who couldn't live off $30 million in the bank?  I'm never going to be sympathetic to this cost. 
[03:11:30]  No, I normally am not either, but only with the ones that seem legit to me.  And 30 years and seven kids is a legitimate life together.  $450 million worth?  It doesn't matter what the amount is, because...  Let's say give her $100 million.  Holy fuck.  That seems like you're being more than fair.  You're partners with somebody for...  It's different.  When you have seven of somebody's children, it's like you're half of their life.  How about she's also entitled to 50% of Mel's future film earnings?  Everything he gets now after they're completely divorced... 
[03:12:00]  I don't agree with that.  She is entitled to half of that also.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's tough.  I don't...  That just...  And then...  Wow.  And Katy Perry and Russell Brand are...  Oh, what a...  Which makes everybody sad.  But he gets tired of juggling those tits around.  They're heavy.  Those big fucking tits.  Heavy, though.  Yeah.  Heavy.  There's gonna be problems in a few years there.  You think?  Yeah.  They don't want the boobies too big.  They're gonna be with someone for a while. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, man.  What are they?  Like 34D?  Big.  Aren't there ones with her just not holding them?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Of course, Sam finds all of her just covered up.  Yeah, what the fuck are you doing?  No, not with pink Donovan either.  Show her tits.  Just tits.  I want tits.  Tits.  No, not covered tits.  Naked tits.  She's in a clown outfit there, stupid.  Just show tits, Sam.  Yes, there are.  Okay, here you go.  Can I get Peter Pumper?  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Nice big areolas.  Jesus Christ.  Are those fake or real?  No, I am.  The picture's not even real.  They probably smell like the back of a leg underneath them. 
[03:13:00]  Like behind your knee when it sweats.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[03:13:30]  No? Sam, you hear me?  Yeah, I heard you. I saw it. It's a fake  picture. That ain't fake.  Katy Perry doesn't have any real nude pictures out.  My friend thought it was really funny years ago.  That's real. We'd say funny names  and IP Daily.  That's a funny one. That's a good one, Jimmy.  IP Daily.  He wrote the book called Yellow River.  That's not the one I posted.  She's nude. I saw the one you posted.  It wasn't real. That one's real? 
[03:14:00]  No. There are no  actual, real naked pictures of Katy Perry.  They're close.  Look at that one. She's got a dick in her ass.  Yeah, it's Katy Perry with a dick  in her ass.  She's making the Katy Perry face, too.  Yeah, so it's gotta be her.  Yeah, that's her. Looks just like her.  Of course it's her.  Oh, wow.  There she is.  Yeah, that's her. It's not her.  Oh, Jimmy.  Let's go home. 
[03:14:30]  Alright.  Where's William Macy?  Put in our time.  Yeah, we did.  Oh, wow.  Happy New Year to everyone.  Nappy do ya.  Oh, that's her.  That has to be her, Sam.  It's right there. You're right.  It looks like her in the face.  And she's naked, so...  You're right.  You could see where the babies come out.  Right there.  You could see where the stink is.  It's not her.  Where they make the stinky...  That's so her.  There's no way Katy Perry would sit there with her, uh... 
[03:15:00]  Oh, Jimmy, you never know.  Ah, that's her sucking dick.  Alright.  Well, it's been wonderful being back.  Yeah, Happy New Year to you and yours.  Yes, we'll see you, uh, tomorrow, uh, same bat time, same bat show.  And, um, can we, uh, talk about lawyers tomorrow on the show?  What about them?  Why?  I want to know, uh, what about them?  Mm-hmm.  Fear factor lawyers compared to Opie and Anthony's lawyers. 
[03:15:30]  Oh.  What's the snake look?  There are a lot of bite snakes on TV and we can't do an eggnog drinking contest?  That's true.  We'll discuss this a little further tomorrow.  Yeah, what's your name, character?  What do you do, character?  Love that guy.  What do you do for a little character?  He's a lawyer.  Yeah, where is that guy?  Can we get him back on?  Can we get him back on?  Let's get him back on.  All right.  D-Rock fucking left us out to fucking hang.  Oh, Jesus.  Eric, what are you doing? 
[03:16:00]  We pay attention.  There were a couple good outs there.  Now we're just fucking floundering.  Yeah, but then people start talking when you're giving out, so...  It was almost the perfect show.  I would have just hit the button when one of us just said, let's...  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:16:30]  Back, back, back.  It will be after Opie and Anthony Live show.  Opie just left.  I was just discussing with him.  At one point, if you were listening today, Jim went into E-Rock's booth.  Because E-Rock has to run the board out of a little side room.  I mean, it's a booth.  We do the phone screening, and there's two boards that the show is run off of.  I have one in front of me, and this is where Opie usually sits, Opie's board. 
[03:17:00]  And then there's another one that controls the commercials.  That's in the side room where E-Rock sits, and that's where the phone screener is.  Jim went in there once earlier in the show.  I think it was during a commercial break.  Because he likes to do this, and we've talked about this before.  He likes to go in there and pass gas.  Is that the correct phraseology, E-Rock?  Do I have this right?  If you want to call it that, yes.  Right, so he goes in there, and he passes gas while E-Rock is running a commercial or doing whatever. 
[03:17:30]  And he'll go in and say something like, hey, E-Rock, do we have a...  And then he'll fart, and then he'll walk out of the room and shut the door.  And the room is small.  So as Anthony said, it turns into like a gas chamber.  Where E-Rock is always equipped with air fresheners and Febrezes and...  Yeah, also, though, the ventilation in this room, the air that comes into this studio is over on the other side by the call screener.  The vent that sucks the air up to recycle it or whatever is right above where I sit. 
[03:18:00]  So it gets blown over and sucked up right near me.  And you say studio.  I mean, some call it a studio.  Others could call it a closet, right?  Well, this is about...  Actually, this is bigger than some of the other studios around here.  But still.  Yeah, it's a closet.  So today we went in, and Jim went in and did it.  And Opie was so enthralled by it that he insisted that we get another two-camera shoot going.  Two-phone camera shoot is what Opie's patented new technique is called. 
[03:18:30]  So Jim went in there.  While I recorded with my phone in here,  Opie followed Jim into E-Rock's studio.  So hopefully we'll have a nice two-phone camera shoot going up on Opie's YouTube channel,  Opie Radio, later on today,  of E-Rock being trapped in the gas chamber.  Was it a bad one?  It looked, from where I sat, like it was not pleasant.  Yeah, because he leaned over.  I knew he was coming in.  He goes, what's this?  And as he leans over the board and, you know, kind of positions his hiney in the air, 
[03:19:00]  just goes...  Wait a minute, he positioned his hiney?  He leans over, like, to the board, but he, you know, like when you stand on your tippy-toes  and kind of put your ass up.  Yeah.  That's what he did and let go.  He can't just go in and do it.  He has to make...  No, he has to make it...  It's an art.  He's a performer.  Yes.  So, you know, he farts, and then within seconds, it's just so sour, and like, it makes your 
[03:19:30]  teeth and your mouth hurt, because if you're breathing it in, like, it's like you're, it's  almost caking to the inside of your mouth.  That's disgusting.  Yeah, it's horrible.  Like those, like when you eat Pillsbury biscuits, but they're not right out of the oven, and they  end up leaving a film on the top of your mouth.  Exactly.  Okay, good point.  Um...  Talk to Sal there, too.  He was in the room.  Intern Sal, you screened phone calls today, correct?  First of all, congratulations on being the intern survivor.  Thank you very much.  Yorick, are we getting more interns this semester? 
[03:20:00]  Yes, we got one more that we just hired.  Ooh.  And...  When does he start?  He...  Or is it a she?  No, it's a he.  We're waiting for, you know, all the typical stuff, you know, school okay, background check,  all that stuff.  Okay.  So as soon as I know, we'll announce that.  But we, I think we have a position, uh, one more position left.  People can still apply?  To fill.  Yeah.  So go to SiriusXM.com slash internships, uh, click on Opie and Anthony, and you could be  an Opie and Anthony intern.  Because since Sal is going to be here, we already have the good intern. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  So I'm going to need at least one that I can kind of mess with their brains and turn into  a bad intern.  Okay.  Uh, hotline.  Hotline.  Hi, I want to be an intern.  I want to be a rock hairstylist.  Welcome, welcome back, Roland.  Hey, how's it going?  I'm surprised he's not busy.  Uh, this was a big day for Roland, because we were just talking about Jim.  William H. Macy's in the building.  And Jim was, was looking to get a photo with the man.  Uh, hopefully Roland will give us an update later.  I didn't realize Jim wasn't here for the last time, uh... 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, I didn't either.  Uh, William H. Macy was in studio.  I didn't either, but I guess he wasn't.  Sal, uh, you were...  So congratulations on being the intern survivor.  Thank you very much.  Uh, are you happy now that we're in a new year?  Yeah.  And the other intern, the bad one, that everybody...  I can't remember his name.  What was it?  I don't know.  It doesn't matter.  Everybody actually has forgotten about him.  Um, I deleted his stuff along with Bobo, so it doesn't matter.  Right.  That's...  Don't bring up the dead.  Well, all right, sorry.  Um, are you happy that you've outwitted, outlasted? 
[03:21:30]  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm happy to be back.  It's cool.  Yeah.  You feel like a winner and a champion?  Uh, yeah.  Are you gonna...  When we get new interns, are you gonna be the type of person that takes people under  their wings and be like, look, guys, I see the look on your face, okay?  I've been there.  I was...  Yes, yes.  I had a first day, too.  I know.  You're thinking, Sal, the intern.  Everybody knows him.  Everybody loves him.  Yes!  I had a first day as an intern.  Let me show you how it's done, kid.  Probably not at all.  That's not you?  That's not me at all.  That's not your personality? 
[03:22:00]  No.  Um, are you looking forward to having...  Yeah, absolutely, because...  It'll take off some of the workload, you know, it'll be nice.  So...  What's your workload like?  You know, just, you know, when...  At least Matt did do...  I'm sorry, uh...  Whatever his name was.  I dumped out.  Don't worry about it.  I did do some stuff that, uh, helped me, you know...  Like the busy work?  Like the...  Yeah, the work that you don't need much...  Skill.  ...brain power to do.  Yeah.  I understand.  Well, this, uh, this new guy, um, reading his resume and talking to him, has all the 
[03:22:30]  production skills that we need.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Pro Tools and does video editing, too.  Nice.  So, he can help out with all that stuff.  Somebody...  Do you do video editing?  No.  Somebody's got a little competition, Sally!  Somebody's got a little...  So, um, Jim went in there while...  You were phone screening today?  Yeah, yeah.  What is it like when Jim goes in there...  It's hysterical.  ...and puts you in the gas chamber?  It sucks, but it's, it is kind of funny.  He just comes in and goes, what's that?  Like, you know, in the chip voice.  Yeah.  And just...  And then...  Gone.  And then he leaves.  Yeah.  Um, so it's hysterical, but you have to kind of put yourself outside the situation. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  Y-Rock was, like, gagging a little bit.  He gets pissed.  It was pretty funny.  Eric doesn't...  Eric doesn't think it's funny.  I saw him, like, throwing things and yelling through the window.  Obviously, I couldn't hear him, but he gets pissed.  Yeah, he started, like, dry heaving a little bit.  Eric, you get upset?  Well, this one I saw coming because Jim kept looking at me with his wide eyes, and I'm like,  oh, no, I know what he's doing, but it's the worst when he leaves the studio, and I  don't see him come, you know, past my window here, so all of a sudden the door just opens, 
[03:23:30]  and, you know, it could be, you know, anybody, and Jim just walks in there, sticks his...  He usually just sticks his ass through the door, lets go, and then slams the door shut  so I can't get to it.  Because you don't believe him anymore when he comes in acting like he has business in there.  No.  Of course not.  You've been around the block one too many times.  Sal, how long does it take before the smell hits you?  Is it an instantaneous thing, or are we talking about a bit of a delay?  Well, this last one was instant because Ope had said it went down the hallway.  When Ope walked away with Jim, he's like, I was still smelling it down the hallway. 
[03:24:00]  Is that how it is?  Yeah, it's pretty quick.  Is there ever moments where you're like, oh, that one wasn't even bad, and then it...  Ah!  Well, I even bought Jim's breakfast this morning.  I was thinking, eh, this is...  Do you know when you're bringing him foods that are going to be worse for you in the  gas chamber?  Well, I don't know.  You know, I brought him cottage cheese today, so that was...  Yeah, when I heard that this morning too, because Jim has lactose issues, because he  always has that...  He's got a delicate tummy.  That lactate...  What is it?  Lactate milk?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:24:30]  Or something like that?  So if he's eating cottage cheese, which is pure dairy, it's not going to be good.  So that was what it was today, Sal?  Just cottage cheese?  What else?  That was on the menu.  And a banana?  Oh, okay.  Well, the banana, I don't know, that potassium.  And then he also drinks two cups of coffee, so it's...  It's not good news for you.  It's all ammo.  Not good news for you guys in the booth.  Well, hopefully...  I don't know how my video turned out.  Hopefully Opie's turned out all right, and the two phone camera shoot will go up, because  they were talking about it today, and Opie and Joe DeRosa came up with this technique, 
[03:25:00]  Sal.  I don't know if you've seen this.  Yeah, I was watching it in the booth.  Yeah, where they're using phone cameras, but they're both filming, and then Opie gets  a video, he slices them together nice.  This one was, I guess they were getting vegetable juice, and Joe threw his all over the street.  But the reason why I think everybody needs to see this video is because something's going  on here at the show, it's been mentioned here and there, a couple jokes were made about 
[03:25:30]  it today, but it really has gone unsaid.  And that's the fact that Opie has decided, without anybody asking him to, without any  challenge, without any goal, to grow an obnoxious, dirty beard.  Like, he's just decided.  Looks like Yukon Cornelius.  Who's that?  The explorer from the animated Rudolph.  The red beard with the little wool cap.  Okay, I understand. 
[03:26:00]  I like the reference, too.  Of course, that's your reference.  Yeah, he's decided to grow.  When you started your internship, Sal, when did you start it?  September.  And Opie was still baby-faced, clean-shaven, right?  Yeah.  And this is a guy who looked like, and you can be honest with me, a male model.  Is that right?  Like, this is a guy who you'd be like, there's Ashton Kutcher, there's-  Well, not according to Troy.  There's Greg Opie Hughes, and then there's everybody else in terms of good looks, in  terms of style, and in terms of sheer physique. 
[03:26:30]  Right?  You could say that.  You could say that.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  I mean, we all know Opie takes a lot of care of his body.  And, you know, Jim has brought up the immaculate shape his abdominals are in on more than one  occasion.  I guess that's what he calls it.  He calls it the V.  The V that points down to the goodness in Opie's body there.  And if you ever see him in person, make sure you point out, wow.  Or ask to see it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:27:00]  Let me see your abs.  Your abs really do look as good as they're described on the radio.  Yeah, just take a picture of you and the abs.  Just bend right down to the belly.  But he decided, I guess, when was it?  November-ish?  Yeah.  November-ish.  Right after Thanksgiving.  To throw out, to November-beard it up.  Yeah.  He told me at one point that, because he was going up to visit his family in Philly, his  in-laws in Philly, over Christmas.  And he said, yeah, I'll probably shave it then.  And then I hung out with him over the break, after Christmas, and he still had the beard 
[03:27:30]  and he's rocking it today.  It's getting to the point where it's like, that's what's noticeable about him.  Yeah.  Like, and you can see it in the video that he posted.  And I think that it should, more of an issue should be made of it, because it's just another  thing that he does.  I think he's doing it to be obnoxious.  Like, I think he's doing it because he knows that some people will be bothered by the fact  that he's doing it.  And he is like a little kid in that way.  Like, sometimes he just does things to be obnoxious. 
[03:28:00]  Because, um, I, what's going to happen, I think, and I hope, is that, and this is what  happened with my hair, for instance.  I started growing my hair, and originally, I had short hair, and me and Danny were having  a hair growth length, a hair growing contest to see, it was Afro Wars, right?  And both of us looked like insane people, at a point.  Like, we were both like, this is stupid.  And then one day, Danny decided to shave all his hair off. 
[03:28:30]  But I had grown my hair for so long, it becomes such a commitment that it's like a part of  you.  And it's like, well, I can't just cut it off.  I mean, then why did I do all that?  So like, I can't see myself getting a haircut anymore.  Could you go, I know you're saying you couldn't see yourself getting a haircut anymore, but  could, can you remember yourself with the short hair?  I look like a different person in photos.  We were going through the photos before the end of the year of just, you know, the entire  archive, and I pulled a bunch of Sam, and it's just so weird to see him. 
[03:29:00]  You like me, don't you?  No.  You really do.  It's just to see that short hair, it's just, it's awkward.  Because it was like, I took a clippers, set it on three, and just clipped down my hair  all the way, all the time.  My hair was always very short, and cropped close to my head and everything.  But then once I started to let it grow, it becomes such a commitment, and also, it's  an identifying feature.  Yeah, I was going to say, that's kind of you now.  Right?  Like, to cut it off is to kind of reshape the whole physical identity of who you are. 
[03:29:30]  You have to get new shirts made and stuff.  Exactly.  Like, how am I going to sell shirts with a guy with an afro, and everyone's like, who's  that guy?  Who's that guy?  I see you with the short hair looking like Corey Matthews on Boy Meets World, but I don't  know who the guy on the shirt is.  So I can't, I can't shave it like that anymore.  But Opie, I hope, and that's the key.  If he'll let it keep growing to a certain length, he's not going to be able to stop it. 
[03:30:00]  I think he's just let it go.  It's going to be like, there's Opie with the giant beard.  Like, that's his thing.  Yeah, let it go.  Like, modest Yahoo.  He had a massive beard, and he just shaved it, and it made TMZ and everything, but now  he just looks like a skinny Jewish guy.  Like, he doesn't look like anything anymore.  Like, I don't want to see that rapper anymore.  Yeah.  Whereas before, he had this giant beard, and that's him.  Sure.  And I honestly think that Opie's going to get to the point where he's like, well, I planned  on shaving this, but I just can't.  And he's got a wife, and he's got a son, and his son's going to be talking by that point, 
[03:30:30]  and his son's going to be like, seriously, Dad?  Like, that's ridiculous.  What are you doing?  And he's going to say, I can't.  I can't shave it off.  Now, he might trim it.  But I think he's going to become Big Bushy Beard Man, and that's going to be the next  level of Greg Opie Hughes.  Check out the beard for yourself.  It's on the Opie Radio YouTube page.  And as he said on the show, we should plug it real quick.  He came out of, when he filmed the video, he had just done Bob Kelly's podcast, which 
[03:31:00]  is on riotcast.com.  I guess he's on the most recent episode that went up yesterday, and I've heard it.  It's great.  It's hilarious.  And it's just Opie chilling and doing a podcast.  Like, you know, you don't hear that too often.  And he's got a massive beard, so what you want to do is watch the YouTube video, get  that picture in your head, and that way you'll be able to properly visualize what's going  on in the podcast.  But yeah, so I'm hoping that that beard keeps going to the point where, you know, once you 
[03:31:30]  pass the point of no return, you're there.  It's like Troy.  Like, his hairdo, he can't change it, because that's him.  And like, if Troy came in, like, he's got the hair, his hair kind of goes up and it's  swooshy.  It's not long.  He can cut it and everything, but he's got a very distinct hairstyle.  Yeah.  And if he ever changed it, it would be changing, that's that different Troy now.  Like, you know, this is blonde sex bagel we're dealing with now.  This is a whole new sex bagel. 
[03:32:00]  I mean, do you feel different?  Um, not anymore.  I did when I first got it, but not anymore.  Your hair was never your identifying feature, though.  I mean, I would, I would, you know what, this is only going to get insulting.  Because you know what I'm going to say.  It's probably a fat joke.  Well, I was going to say, it would be like me cutting my hair, Opie shaving his beard,  would be like if E-Rock showed up here skinny one day.  And we'd be like, but because it's a different guy.  Because then what's Ant going to make the jokes about?  And Jim and Opie and me and Sal, you when E-Rock's not around. 
[03:32:30]  What are we going to, what are we going to make the jokes about?  You know what I mean?  It's an identifying feature.  You know what I'm saying, right, Eric?  I'm not insulting you.  Sure.  You thought the hair would, you said, though, that you thought the blonde hair would be out  by Christmas-ish.  I thought so.  I thought it was going to grow out faster than it has been.  Yeah, but it is growing out pretty fast.  I know, you're loosely horrible.  But nobody else thought that it would grow out.  How fast do you think hair grows?  My hair usually grows pretty damn fast. 
[03:33:00]  Are you going to cut it very short as to speed up the process?  No, I'm not going to do like, I'm not going to do like a number one razor all around it.  You're just going to be like, cool guy who had a bleach job, but now he's letting his roots  grow out because he don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  I like that.  I like the attitude.  The awkward hipster look.  Yeah.  Obi and Anthony and Jim started the show today because we're back from, I think it turned  out to be, it was almost two weeks, like a week and a half vacation. 
[03:33:30]  Hope everybody had a very pleasant New Year's Eve, I should say, and New Year's Day and Christmas  and Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and all that stuff.  But we started the show talking about how you wake up now because we have to get up to  do this show.  I mean, I, we, the staff has to get up even earlier than O&A do, but, um, like I'm up  a quarter to four and you get these routines that are just ingrained.  So, because otherwise, because your body doesn't know what to do at that hour in the morning. 
[03:34:00]  So you're just ingrained.  You wake up, you do this, you do that, you do this, you go out the door and then you're  at work.  But Ant was saying he's walking around the house with one sock on it and a toothbrush  sticking out of his mouth.  Because you do, you take all this time off and all of a sudden you're totally out of  whack.  Your, your whole procedure, you've forgotten it.  Like I woke up this morning confused as to what my alarm was.  Um, I think at one point I thought somebody, a person was waking me up. 
[03:34:30]  Um, at one point I thought there were two of me because I have two alarms and I, in my  mind, I thought there was one alarm for each person.  Then I woke up and I didn't know where any clothes were.  Uh, it, it was completely, I mean, by, it takes until you get here before you're back  into the swing of things.  But in the, in the early morning, it's completely foreign and it's only been a week and a half.  Did you drive in?  Yeah, I drove, I always drive in.  And that's the other thing.  Oh, I'm glad, I, I'm glad, because. 
[03:35:00]  Because if, I think you might be going where I'm going with this.  No, no, no, go ahead.  No, I, I was driving and then I realized I didn't make a turn somewhere.  Oh.  Because I wasn't used to driving that way anymore.  I go, oh fuck, I had to, you know, swing back around and go right towards the tunnel.  The, uh, the funny thing about driving at this hour in the morning is, because I drive  at like, whatever, 415, 425, and, uh, I'm driving into the city.  And because it's that early, there's almost nobody on the road.  And so whenever I see another car, like whenever I see another pair of headlights in my rear 
[03:35:30]  view mirror or anything, I'm just going, what the fuck is he doing on the road?  Like, I just get pissed off that somebody is sharing, one car is sharing my road with  me.  What is he going?  What does he want?  He shouldn't be here.  And I have to slow down and let him pass me so I can have the road completely to myself.  Um, but I knew, Eric, it was going to be rough for you because, like, Eric and me were still  in vacation mode last night.  It was like 11 o'clock at night.  Yeah.  And Eric and me-  Well, I tried going to bed. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  And it didn't work.  Eric and me-  Like, I, if I lay there without something on, just the, like, my head just doesn't turn  off and I, it's like I keep talking to myself.  So I gotta talk to yourself about-  Just, so, every stupid little thing that's going on in my day-  Animaniacs?  No.  I haven't watched that in a long time.  Which was the best episode.  But, uh, no, so I'm like, fuck it, I have to go, I gotta put the TV back on to watch and  hopefully fall asleep again.  I have to literally turn the TV off and make a commitment that the TV can't come back on. 
[03:36:30]  Like, if it's after, like, if it's 11 o'clock, I'm not turning the TV back on.  Like, last night I was in bed for over an hour and a half just letting my mind wander,  but I couldn't-  See, that's the problem.  I gotta put the TV on with the sleep timer, put the remote off to the side and just kind  of lay there and watch and pass out before the TV turns off.  Yeah, because Eric and me at 11 o'clock at night are texting each other about wrestling  that's on.  Because, I mean, we both knew, we were still on vacation as far as we were concerned with  no-  I honestly didn't think you were up, but I put something out there, I'm like, let's 
[03:37:00]  see if Sam responses, and you text me all pissed off, I'm like, Sam's up.  Did you really put it out there to see if I was up?  Well, I was trying to think, what would be so bizarre and doesn't make any sense based  on what we were watching?  Eric makes these wrestling predictions, and Eric is as, well, I don't know if as big, but  he's a big wrestling fan.  As long.  As long.  I've been watching it since I was a little kid.  In the same way I am, but he hasn't, like, I think his, I honestly think that E-Rock's 
[03:37:30]  mind has not developed with wrestling, and that when he turns it on, he still regresses  back to when he was a little kid.  Because he comes up with these storylines and predictions, and where he wants the TV  show to go, that just makes no sense whatsoever.  There's a small portion of what I think going, alright, I know, because as you, you know,  you say, that's bad for business, this isn't going to work.  Ever.  There's a little part that, you know, when I think of something, I'm like, okay, yeah, 
[03:38:00]  that's not a really good business deal, but you know what, that's just so outrageous,  I want to see that, I don't care about the business, and then I say it to you, and you  get all mad.  Yeah, because it doesn't make sense, it's bad for business.  It makes sense to me.  Like, whenever, like, Chris Jericho returned last night, and E-Rock is spouting off with  all these ideas about people that are already involved in other storylines, and he just  wants to blow them off.  Yeah, I'm not thinking about other story arcs, and, you know, six months down the road, I'm  thinking, what would I see next week?  It's just so stupid, and I'm trying to go to sleep, and I'm just kind of perusing through  Twitter, and get one of E-Rock's goddamn wrestling predictions again. 
[03:38:30]  E-Rock Radio on Twitter, by the way.  And I have to just, uh, kill him, yes, E-Rock Radio.  As a matter of fact, you can also, uh, go to NotSam on Twitter.  Uh, I didn't retweet Eric, but you just can.  Uh, we got Ron and Fez intern.  Yes.  How's it going?  You're...  UCB Fred.  Yeah, but I was, I didn't know how to call him Matt or Fred, I forgot which one...  You can call me or whatever.  UCB Fred, that way we get...  Is this Matt?  Everybody knows.  Is this Ron and Fez's first day back?  Yes.  Ron and Fez are back today, at 11 o'clock, live. 
[03:39:00]  That's good to know UCB Fred.  Do not change the station.  No, because...  As soon as the show ends.  You know, I think there are people who change the station as soon as Opie and Anthony end,  and then change it back as soon as I end, so they leave and then come back for Ron and Fez.  Well, they shouldn't do that.  I don't, I don't think so either, but I think they do.  I don't think there's anyone who says, man, Sam's after show is over, I gotta turn it off  before Ron and Fez come on.  I've gotten my radio filled.  So, um, how was, how's it getting back to the grind, getting back to the routine for 
[03:39:30]  you guys?  Because it's not as rough because you don't have the crazy wake-up times where the mind  is still clouded.  Yeah, I feel fresh.  I feel more like I did when I first started, you know, like really refreshed.  By the end, you know, really kind of takes a toll on you, but I feel, I feel good.  You feel like you're starting anew.  Yeah.  Do you have any New Year's resolutions?  I have a few New Year's resolutions.  What are they?  Well, one of them's a holdover from last year, and that's the gain 10 pounds.  I actually lost five this year. 
[03:40:00]  So you should be gaining 15.  Well, yeah, I should.  But you don't want to set those goals too high.  Obviously, last time you, uh, you gained negative pounds.  Yeah.  I want to get back over 140 this year.  Okay.  Um, well, uh, good luck to you.  How much do you weigh now?  About 135.  135.  Okay.  And you're how tall?  Probably like 6'1".  Okay, that's not enough weight on a person.  Is that, like, bad or?  Yeah, oh yeah, that's like, uh, Ethiopia bad.  That's like, like Sally Struthers, like, has to start a collection for you bad. 
[03:40:30]  All right, well.  You know, like, that's like, sickly, you know, Somalia flies flying around you, and all you're  trying to do is convince someone to send you enough money for Cheetos.  Bad.  That would explain a lot of things, like why I feel so tired a lot of the time.  You know why?  Because your body doesn't get enough nourishment.  Oh, okay.  You know, stuff like that.  That stuff you all gotta, is, why don't you just eat more?  Um, it costs a lot of money, and sometimes, like, when you, it costs money to eat. 
[03:41:00]  I know, but not a lot.  You can, you could eat a, a, a regular diet without, without being Bill Gates, I think.  I guess.  I think, even poor folk find a way to get a couple meals a day.  Also, when I get sad, I don't eat.  How often are you sad?  You used to be afraid.  Not that often, but sometimes when you get sad, you might, you know, you don't feel like  eating for a day.  So, like, you'll be sad about something, and then you'll be like, oh, fuck, I'm sad,  I'm not gonna fill my New Year's resolution, and then you'll get even more sad.  Yeah, it's, it's kind of like a, a chain reaction, it's like feedback, you know? 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, it's just a horrible cycle that you get stuck on.  It's pretty bad.  Here's Roland coming up the hall.  What's E-Rock doing in here?  I'm used to you being in the gas chamber.  I'm just getting some stuff.  Oh.  I want to know if, uh, if, if Jim was able to pull off this picture.  Let's see, he's walking up here.  Is he gonna come in?  Roland's coming in.  Okay, good.  Roland!  How was vacation, buddy?  You like pressure?  I will.  Archer on Blu-ray, fantastic. 
[03:42:00]  Do you like Archer?  How was vacation?  That was good, fantastic.  You were in Las Vegas and Arizona.  Right here, number one son.  Number one son right here.  To see in the family.  Oh, fantastic.  The, are you, you are, you have a brother, obviously Roger.  Yes.  He's been on the show before.  Yes.  Um, you're number one right now?  Number one.  How far behind is Roger?  Woo!  Very far, why is that?  He's not in the family anymore.  Roger's not in the family?  Sort of, but it's still number one son here talking.  Why is Roger not in the family?  Yeah, things happen, things move, things shift. 
[03:42:30]  That's fantastic, I tell you.  So, so, your goal for Christmas was to go down there and not only be number one son, but  get your other brother out of the family altogether.  No, the family, he's still part of it, but number one son.  He's part of it on paper.  Yeah, number one son, though.  But you're number one by a mile.  Leaps and bounds.  It's just the two of you, though, competing, right?  I don't think he knew about the competition, but...  Well, that's even better for you.  Fantastic.  That makes it even easier for you.  Is there any...  What did you do to be such a great son? 
[03:43:00]  I didn't have to do that much, but it was fantastic.  My parents chowder me with gifts and everything.  Hang on, Roland.  Some people want to compliment me.  Joe, you're on the after show.  Hey, Sam.  How you doing, Joe?  Some people do like the shit hour.  Thank you very much, Joe.  Once it's over, I put your 80s on 8.  Well, stay tuned for Ron and Pez.  They're all so good.  Oh, all right.  Thanks.  And also, Roland, let's hear from Scott.  Scott, you're on after Open Anthony Live.  I can't believe I got through on the first call.  That's right. 
[03:43:30]  I just wanted you to know that absolutely there's at least one, or now me and Sam, two  people, our show, I guess it was, that listen to you, and then I absolutely flip the channel  over to 11 and listen to something else, usually sports.  Okay.  Well, sports are good, but Ron and Pez is a great show.  You should give them a listen.  There's also on the Bruce channel, too.  Backstreet is awesome.  At least noon.  Well, we'll just go to 11, but thank you very much, Scott.  Thank you.  Sam, what about the Bruce channel, though?  Well, the Bruce channel is good, but that's something you could turn on around 3-ish.  Is that good?  Yeah.  3-ish.  But see, I like to turn it on right after the show, or even during our show. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, that's true.  Here, a little bit of Bruce.  It's a special case.  You go, oh, they got William H. Macy in studio, and then you go, okay, let's see what's going  on over on Bruce.  This interview is kind of driving itself right now.  I need to feel the power of Bruce as I work, so.  Now, we were talking about Hoarders today.  Yeah, she's coming in.  That's what I thought, and this is the same doctor who's come in before.  Robin.  Robin.  Robin Z.  She fit in well with the show, and when's she going to be here?  This week?  Next week.  Next week.  Okay, this is very exciting.  What else is going on this week? 
[03:44:30]  David Duchovny.  Duchovny's coming back.  Double D, yeah.  Now, you are David Duchovny's biggest fan.  I love him.  President of the fan club.  Love him.  Like, almost like a gay thing, or no?  If he needs somebody to cuddle with, I'm there for him.  Okay.  But not in a gay way.  Not in a man way.  Yeah, not in a gay way, just in a functional way.  Yeah.  If you need a cuddle, if you need a release.  I'm here for you.  Right.  But not like a whole sexual thing.  Do I?  I want to say a gay way, in the Joe DeRosa way. 
[03:45:00]  Okay.  Like, you can appreciate him, and you're like-  I'll DeRosa him.  I'm thinking about this on a different level.  I like that.  When's he coming in?  Friday.  Promote X-Files?  No, Californication.  Oh.  X-Files is a good show, too.  But Californication is awesome.  That's true.  You know who loves Californication?  Mars.  And believe it or not-  No, he does?  Yeah, I try-  He follows the storyline?  I-  Yes.  I-  Mars watches a lot of television.  And he doesn't just watch old stuff, he watches new stuff.  I trust Mars-  Yeah, he does.  For TV shows.  He Netflix streams. 
[03:45:30]  I mean, while he's supposed to be at work, he's watching these shows.  I don't say that, thanks.  So, uh, number one son, this is great.  That's a great Christmas gift for you.  Fantastic.  Did-  This is a question that's on America's mind right now.  Uh, did-  Did James Norton, did he get the William H. Macy photo?  I'm standing here live, so the answer is yes!  Yeah!  Woo!  Because, I'll tell you, if that photo had not taken place, you still would have come in here. 
[03:46:00]  But it wouldn't have been happy.  You wouldn't have been passing out these Archer Blu-rays.  You would have been-  Dick in the ass.  You would have walked in slowly, head pointed to the ground, and just grabbed a mic.  Like, no matter what I was talking about, and said,  Dick in the ass.  I said, guess where the one in 2012 is?  In my asshole.  Is 2012, do you have any New Year's resolutions?  Yeah, lose weight, whatever.  Broke that.  Try.  Yeah, why don't you try to see if a UCB Fred can borrow 10 a year pounds. 
[03:46:30]  I have a goal.  Mine is to actually gain weight.  Just follow me around.  You know, I'll tell you that's true.  Just put the fumes on getting 10 pounds.  I'll tell you that, if you hung out with Roland more, you would gain weight.  Eric, all fat jokes aside, you hang out with Roland a lot.  Yeah.  It's not the healthiest thing a person can do for themselves, is it?  No, because Roland knows so many great places to eat.  And Eric, are they all delicious?  I don't think Roland has steered me wrong once. 
[03:47:00]  This is not Eric's fault, too, because I order two appetizers.  I go, try one if you want, and then they're so good.  You can't just try one.  No.  Yeah, that's it.  I mean, even with me, we'll go out to a barbecue place, and I'll be like,  yeah, I'll have this, or I'll have this chicken sandwich, and Roland will get a burger.  Did you go to the barbecue place that we go to?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then it'll be like, yeah, you want to, let's get wings, too.  And I go, okay.  Frito pie.  And yeah, let's get some chips.  Okay.  Frito pie, yeah.  Say, why don't you have some? 
[03:47:30]  Oh, okay, I'll have some, but I won't have enough.  You'll have plenty of room in there.  Just keep eating.  Look at me, I'm eating.  The first time Roland took me there, you know, I'm looking through the menu,  and he's ordering all this stuff.  I go, what?  I said, you're going to eat all that?  And he goes, no, you're going to want this.  And then the appetizer comes, and he goes, you try this with this,  dip that into that, and then try that.  Like, he just gives you instructions.  That's great.  Yeah.  Actually, this is from Chris in Seattle.  It says, why are all of you people either 130 pounds or 300 pounds? 
[03:48:00]  Is anybody normal size?  Which is true.  That is true.  It's stress in both directions.  It is.  Yeah, we're all unhealthy.  Some of us choose not to eat because we're sad, like UCB Fred,  and some of us overindulge because of stresses.  Oh, you get bit your sweet ass.  I started getting depressed yesterday.  I text Eric.  I go, I'm sad today.  So why was it?  It's like the first day back in school.  You know what's going to happen.  Oh, it was like the typical Sunday feeling. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  Did you eat a lot to help you with that?  No.  Did you?  Yeah.  Just so everyone knows, because the show likes to complain about things,  we love what we do and we like the show and everything.  Speak for yourself.  Okay, fine.  I like the show and what I do.  But just like any job, when you're on a long vacation,  it doesn't matter how great your job is,  you still just don't want to go back after two weeks.  I don't think a lot of people even have a week and a half vacations.  That's a huge amount of time.  We're on a school schedule. 
[03:49:00]  It's ridiculous.  Weekend teacher conference.  Before I left, I went to eat a burger and I got two burgers.  On the West Coast then.  Yeah, and I got two burgers and my mom goes,  you know they're going to scan your burger.  I'm like, I don't care.  So when I went to Vegas, the woman goes,  we're going to scan your burger.  I'm like, that's going to deter me of eating it, sweetheart.  Just scan it so I can fucking eat it.  So she scanned your burger.  Oh, in the airport?  Yeah, in the airport.  You put it through the x-ray in the airport?  They made me.  And then you ate it.  Fuck yeah.  That's radiation. 
[03:49:30]  It was so good.  You know how when the...  And I shit over Colorado and Pittsburgh.  Because you can see the map where you're flying.  The special sauce gets rancid from it.  You know how when you're at the doctor and you have to get an x-ray,  they put a lead protector over your chest?  That's because of dangers that you get from doing things like getting an x-ray  or putting your food through x-ray machines.  Well, they scan you.  The full body scan?  Yeah.  So I had the bag and they full body scan me and then they grab me.  They go, what's in the bag?  I said, deliciousness. 
[03:50:00]  What's it like when you're at home?  And the big fat woman goes, what do you mean?  I go, come on, honey.  You know.  You know.  What's it like when you're at home?  Is the home cooking?  Are you eating more or less?  My dad cooks phenomenally.  Yeah, his dad's a great cook.  Oh, your dad's like a chef, right?  Yeah.  My dad got two pound porterhouse steaks, double stuffed baked potato.  So how come you were skinny when you were like a kid?  Like when you were young, you were skinny, but your dad was...  Was it just metabolism and it all caught up with you?  It's called life.  It was stress in the other direction.  Yeah.  The only thing I had to worry about is will I make my TV show on time and how much time 
[03:50:30]  do I have to play?  Now it's just like work is like, ah.  Yeah.  Dick in the ass.  You get very stressed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Even my dad goes, he goes, you should lose some weight.  I go, I'm trying, dad.  He goes, one pound or two pound porterhouse?  I'm like, two pound, dad.  Two pound.  I do have to stress for life.  I do have to point out too, just like Sam's hair or me or anybody else on the show, going  through the archive, seeing where Roland started with us to where he is now, this show has  fucked him up.  But see, the difference...  And my hair too. 
[03:51:00]  The, the, the, it went from here to...  Yeah.  Lost hair, gained weight.  It just, what a terrible equation.  You guys could stanza me.  Talk about a dick in the ass.  You guys could stanza me.  I'm like, Jesus.  But, but with Opie, we're talking about Opie's beard, it's going to be, I, I think it's  going to become his thing.  Whereas, if I cut my hair off, I'd be a different dude.  If E-Rock got skinny, he would be a different dude.  It would be like if Roland lost his speech thing he's got going on.  Because he could get skinny, but he'd still go like, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,  and it'd be like, it'd still be Roland.  That'd be hilarious. 
[03:51:30]  I might have a deep voice.  But he just came in like, hello, Opie, Anthony, I've got some, I've got some guests to pitch  you.  What do you think of David Duchovny?  It'd be like, no, this doesn't work anymore.  They understand me.  Yeah.  You'd be trying to mumble, and it would just be like, yeah, I don't, I don't know what  happened.  It would still be completely like eloquent.  It's funny, Eric, though, that you clarified that you're not complaining, because how long?  It was three minutes, I would say.  It was a matter of minutes into this show. 
[03:52:00]  And that, I think that's when I was officially back.  When I was like, okay, nothing's changed.  I'm back to the, to the regular grind of this thing.  When, after minutes of being on the air for the first time in a week and a half, Opie  referred to our management down the hall as those assholes down the hall.  It was minutes.  Nothing has happened yet.  Nothing could.  It's just carrying over.  We, we, we got, we all got here.  Yeah.  They got here, you know, before the show starts.  They were just reading their papers, going through all the articles and the audio. 
[03:52:30]  Show starts.  Management wasn't even here to talk to them.  Nothing could have happened.  And they just said, oh, we're back, those fucking assholes.  Those fucking assholes down the hall.  And I said, okay, I'm finally, I'm finally back.  I know.  Yeah, sure.  I'm back.  I'm back on the grind, as they say.  Listen, why don't we give one of these away?  Roland just threw it to me.  Archer, the complete season two.  Second season.  Yeah.  This is the animated show on FX.  Who's in this show?  A bunch of famous people, right? 
[03:53:00]  Who does the voices?  It's animated, obviously.  So it's not like the people.  But a lot of famous people do the voices.  It's a hilarious show.  It's not like a kid's cartoon.  I would say it's one of the cartoons like E-Rock would watch.  But he watches kids cartoons.  So that doesn't.  I watch this.  That doesn't apply.  You watch anything that's animated.  Well, this has.  Well, you're not going to know who he is.  But his name is John Benjamin.  He was in Home Movies, Dr. Katz.  Oh, okay.  I know Dr. Katz.  Professional therapist.  He played Brendan Small. 
[03:53:30]  So, call Ace.  No, no, he didn't play Brendan.  He played another character in there.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  And I have the complete season two on Blu-ray that I'm going to give to one person.  On the airplane, I saw Glee.  I paid $5.99.  I was bored to see Glee, the movie.  There's a Glee movie?  Glee 3D movie on the airplane.  Oh, my God.  You paid $6?  I did.  And then I just, a little kid behind me popped his head up.  Wait, they have 3D on a plane?  It wasn't 3D, though.  It was the Glee movie.  They paid for the 3D, but I didn't get the 3D. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, the kid behind me goes,  Mommy, he's watching Glee.  Ew.  I feel so, yeah.  All right, let me go to this line.  Yes, sir, or madam.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  What's your name?  My name's Brian.  How you doing, Sam?  I'm doing very well, Brian.  Would you like, do you watch Archer?  I have not, but I've heard about it, and I would love to see it.  Would you want to, do you want to start with season two?  Yeah, do you want to watch it on TV, or do you want to just get to see it in high definition  on your own time? 
[03:54:30]  Oh, let's think for a moment.  Let's do some high definition, sir.  All right, Brian.  You just won season two of Archer on Blu-ray, so stay on hold, and one of my lovely assistants  will take your information.  Awesome.  Thank you.  All right.  Can I call the interns and possibly E-Rock, when there's no interns here, my lovely assistants?  No.  I like that.  Can I start doing that from now on?  E-Rock, that's kind of...  What about the prince and his assistants?  Oh.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Because he is the prince.  E-Rock, when you watch, we were talking about intervention today, and that crazy chick 
[03:55:00]  that was also on crack, and saying, you know, how much would you deal with?  Because, like Ant said, he would deal with this batty bitch who was on all kinds of drugs  because she was hot.  He'd deal with her for a little while.  Is this...  You don't deal with this at all because you're worried these are the type of people that will  steal your sperm?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, that's correct.  I'm glad you're finally in doing it.  Did you see the one where they showed Joe McKell in the soup where the woman ate her husband's 
[03:55:30]  ashes?  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  I did see that.  Was that intervention, or was that one of the other...  I'm not sure, it was either intervention or one of the other ones where she just licks  her finger, puts in the ashes, and just eats it.  A&E should just change the name of the network to We're Fucking Nuts, and then just put these  shows on without title.  It's just like, oh, yeah, did you watch, you know, We're Fucking Nuts.  This show's about somebody who eats ashes.  This show's about someone who's on drugs.  This shows...  Yeah, they show it at the movies, and she's like, watch that movie, licked her finger,  put it in, licked it.  I think, though, A&E is the one reality show network with integrity, because, like, we 
[03:56:00]  were watching, Obi brought up Extreme Cheapskates today.  Oh, that's a good one.  And that was one where a woman was using squares of fabric instead of toilet paper to  wipe assholes, and then family assholes, and then washing the cloths instead of buying  toilet paper, there was some suspicion brought up that that was phony, that that was fake.  A lot of the shows on E! have been brought up, could be fake. 
[03:56:30]  A&E, like Hoarders and Intervention, are not fake.  It's like History Channel.  I love Alaska Gold Rush.  Yeah?  I got addicted to that.  Like, those are the only ones that you can watch that you're like, okay, this is actually  a reality show.  They're insane people, but it works.  Listen, I would encourage you all...  I'm sorry we only had the one season of, uh, one season two copy of Archer to give away.  I would love to give something to each and every one of you.  Um, I guess make sure you look at everybody's side projects that we were talking about today. 
[03:57:00]  Podcasts and YouTube videos and whatnot.  But you know what?  What's even more important?  Your podcast?  What?  I...  Roland?  You could say whatever you want, but I'm not here to plug that.  Um...  Is that on iTunes?  Of course it is.  What's that under?  What's more important is...  Live from the compound on iTunes.  No, what's more important is this show.  Why don't you tune in...  HD video.  Why don't you tune in tomorrow...  It's number four right now.  And listen...  Eric.  Listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay?  Because that's where all the magic happens. 
[03:57:30]  And after Opie and Anthony Live following that, stay tuned, because the first Ron and  Fez of 2012...  Or...  Go download Sam's podcast now.  And listen to it.  It's coming up next.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony Live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.
