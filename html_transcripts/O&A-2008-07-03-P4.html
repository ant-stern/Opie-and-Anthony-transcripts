<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment featuring Twitchell and his agent, Pat (on the phone), along with Jim Norton and a remotely connected Joe Rogan in the studio.  The central focus was Twitchell's compulsion to eat Almond Joys until vomiting, stemming from a childhood trauma involving excessive Almond Joy consumption.  The hosts provided Twitchell with numerous bags of Almond Joys, encouraging him to indulge.  He eventually succumbed, vomiting repeatedly on studio equipment and personnel.  The vomit's consistency and the distinct smell of Red Bull were noted.  Twitchell's descriptions of his childhood trauma and feelings about his mother were interwoven with discussions of his bowel movements and potential OCD.  Despite the vomiting, Twitchell continued eating Almond Joys, providing numerous opportunities for jokes and observations from the hosts and guests.  The "money shot" of Twitchell vomiting was repeatedly highlighted as something to be shared online.

Next, a discussion about global warming ensued.  Seth Rogen and Bill Hader were mentioned as previous guests, along with JBL (John Bradshaw Layfield).  Studio guest Steve debated Anthony, who expressed concern over global warming, citing Al Gore's *An Inconvenient Truth*. Steve argued against the urgency, prompting reactions from Anthony and callers.  Points of contention included melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels (and the potential submersion of Florida), the impact of fossil fuels, and the speed of environmental change. A physicist called in briefly supporting Anthony's view.  Davis Guggenheim, director of *An Inconvenient Truth*, called in later, stressing the problem's multifaceted nature and the need for collective action, discussing alternative energy, big business, and individual responsibility. The segment transitioned to lighter topics, including ringtones and a list of "most depressing songs of all time," including snippets of various songs accompanied by the hosts' commentary.  The global warming debate remained unresolved.

The show continued with a segment focusing on depressing songs, punctuated by highly offensive and sexually explicit commentary. The hosts offered crude interpretations of songs like "Strange Fruit," "People Who Died," "D.O.A.," "Seasons in the Sun," "Total Eclipse of the Heart," "Honey," "The Shortest Story," and "The Christmas Shoes," frequently rewriting lyrics with graphic sexual content and using racial, homophobic, and misogynistic slurs. Listener calls interspersed the discussion, some suggesting additional songs. Jimmy Norton shared a vulgar story about a massage that escalated into a sexual encounter.

The final segment centered on a listener, Patty, facing financial hardship, and the hosts recounted their juvenile pranks (with friends Tom Naylor, Looch, Mark Rosenberg, Stanley, Mike, and Marvin Schnoll named) including acts of vandalism and bodily fluid-related pranks. The main event involved Patty, blindfolded and naked, searching for two $1,000 checks hidden among mousetraps on the studio floor.  The hosts detailed Patty's past appearances, referencing instances of financial and other assistance (fixing hammer toes, providing a wig, arranging a makeover). Patty mentioned her recent job loss at Godiva.  She successfully completed the challenge, despite sustaining mousetrap injuries. The show concluded with a jingle.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We got Pat, Twitchell's agent, on the phone.  Can we get Twitchell's in here?  Where is he?  Still shitting?  He's over here.  We'll get back into a groove again in a second here.  Hi, Twitchell's.  How was the crap?  It was great, thanks. 
[00:00:30]  My stomach just feels really queasy still.  Yeah, well, that Red Bull probably.  Four.  Four Red Bulls you're up to?  Well, it's what I'm done with.  Total four.  I think that's my record.  The first time I did it on here, I think I only did two.  And that psyched me.  I feel really sick.  You feel sick, huh?  It came out like a SlimFast shake.  Hey, you know, you're eight.  You know your agent Pat, right? 
[00:01:00]  Marketing agent, yeah, yeah.  Marketing agent.  Pat.  Yeah, he doesn't have solid logs, you're right.  There's no way you could have solid logs with all that moving around and jumping and stuff.  And the Red Bull.  And the Red Bull and all that.  I keep forgetting that.  I can curse me.  You talking about my shit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Moving around and jumping makes your shit loose?  You've got to think it's like breaking it up in there.  Hopefully you're breaking it up in there.  That's what I was thinking.  I figured he's got an opi has a mic in front of him, so that means everything he says is the truth.  He's an expert.  Yeah, expert. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, of course.  Are your logs soupy?  Very soupy.  They're not really logs and they're soupy, right?  No.  It's just a nervous evacuation.  That's actually a good point.  All right, Twitchels.  Pat's on the line.  Pat.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Were you listening to Twitchels earlier?  Yeah, absolutely.  He did a fantastic job for us today.  He's amazing.  Yo, what's up, man?  Well, I figured I just wanted to give Lou a little present since the ride up from Boston  back and forth to your remote was like a death trap for me. 
[00:02:00]  I figured I'd give you a little tidbit.  I want to be a little tidbit.  So whenever Louis has a bunch of Almond Joys in front of him, he has to eat every single  one of them until he pukes.  Are you kidding?  Nope.  This came from when he was a kid.  He broke into the closet, ate a bunch of them, got sick, and he's absolutely obsessed  with them.  Do you like Almond Joys?  You motherfucker.  Nice.  Are you kidding? 
[00:02:30]  Is that true?  You promised you wouldn't say anything.  Well, you also promised you wouldn't kill us from the ride home from Boston.  I didn't kill us, did I?  I didn't, did I?  Came pretty close.  Why would you have him in the passenger seat?  I really wanted to put him in the trunk, but he wasn't going for that.  Do you like Almond Joys, Lou?  Uh, yes.  I like them.  Who doesn't like Almond Joys?  No one likes Almond.  No one's eaten one since 1978.  They're good.  They're good food.  That's why they make mouths.  They're good food.  Bring in the bucket. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, no.  No one has eaten Almond Joys in 20 years.  Hey, who wants an Almond Joy?  Oh, look at the Almond Joys.  How many do you think it'll take to get him to throw up?  Well, we got two bags and bags and three bags.  Jimmy, I know you would enjoy a nice Almond Joy.  Bill, here you go.  Let me have two, Ope.  I enjoy it.  Anthony, and I'll have one of those, Ope.  Joe, pass them out to the death squad.  There you go.  Almond Joys for the boys.  Almond Joys for everybody.  Almond Joys for the camera dude.  Delicious.  Twitch, would you like one? 
[00:03:30]  No, I don't want one.  They're quite good.  I haven't had Almond Joy in years.  Just have one.  Is he still on the line?  Delicious, coconut.  Pat is on the line.  As soon as he has one, it's all over.  Just have one.  I don't want one.  300 without even blinking.  I don't want one.  Just have one.  Trust me.  Yeah, just try one.  You want like 50 of them.  You've got to eat this, bro.  Oh, my God.  I don't want one.  I don't want one.  Dude, it's good.  It's really good.  Dude, eat it.  Come on.  Twitch, eat it.  Coconut and nut. 
[00:04:00]  I trusted you, you fat fucking bastard.  Put it in his mouth.  Put it in his mouth.  Put it in his mouth.  I don't want one.  I don't want one.  Come on, dude.  Eat it.  Open your mouth.  Eat it.  Eat it.  Eat it.  Eat it.  Open your mouth.  This is delicious.  Just shove it in there, dude.  Oh, it's on now.  How good is that?  It's on now.  Just grab that like a bird grabs a worm.  Come on, man.  That's like heroin, isn't it?  I have some more over here.  Come on over here, bro.  There's plenty.  Look, he's getting the sweats.  Are you enjoying it?  How good does that taste?  How good does that taste? 
[00:04:30]  It tastes really good.  There's plenty.  Oh, wow.  Joe Rogan wants you to have one.  Hey, Joe, can I have another Almond Joy, please?  Sure.  These are delicious.  They are good, aren't they?  There you go.  You know what it is, Jim?  It's something about that coconut.  The coconut, the nuts.  Yeah, just...  Don't throw it out.  Dude, look at this.  This is delicious.  Oh, my God.  They're so good.  How many have one of them in the trash?  He's trying to fight it off.  He threw one in the trash.  Threw one away and then ate another one.  E-Rock, why don't you start counting how many of these little Almond Joys...  You can have one more. 
[00:05:00]  Jesus, Almond Joy, I can tell you.  Yeah, just one more.  They're quite delicious.  Oh, my God.  That's so good.  I mean, they got Joy right in the name.  Danny, you want to count?  Sure.  Danny's going to count.  How many are you up to there?  Three, four?  Broke into that closet when you were young, huh?  By the way, Pat's still on the line if you want to...  That really is an awful name, isn't it?  It would be a great bet to see how many Twitchels can eat before he actually vomits.  What do you think?  How many do you think he can eat?  Almond happiness.  I think he can do at least two hundred.  That doesn't make sense.  Two hundred?  Two hundred?  No.  These are the bite-sized ones. 
[00:05:30]  How many is he up to?  You can't eat two hundred of anything.  These are fun-sized.  How many are you up to, Twitchels?  Twitchels are M&Ms.  Four, five?  All right, let's get the money up.  How many?  I think he can eat 40.  40?  40.  That's nothing.  No way.  He's going to eat more than 40.  Danny, throw me another one of these delicious treats.  I don't think so.  What's better than an almond joy?  I don't think anything.  Did he have a groove yet?  Did he start pounding them down?  No, he doesn't really care.  He'll eat a few and he'll be done.  It's very interesting.  He's like slowly getting up to speed, I guess. 
[00:06:00]  I'm trying to explain it.  He's fully giving in to his addiction.  Thank you, Phil.  That's exactly it.  I can't see any more than 50.  I've had four Red Bulls.  I've had a cup of coffee.  I've had a lot of water.  I just took a big shit.  I don't want any more.  I really...  All right.  I don't want any more.  Are you going to stop eating them then?  They're on the table.  They're there.  They're right there.  They're going to waste the weather if you want them.  That looks delicious, man.  That was hilarious.  You should get to them before the...  He's just giving us a reach out of the day.  And there's another. 
[00:06:30]  He just pushed the mic away.  See how quickly he grabbed him?  Like a frantic...  It's like the way I feed my dog roast beef.  The way he snatches it out of my hand.  That's what it was like.  The hat is off, people.  The hat has come off.  Just have moderation.  Just say no to yourself.  You don't have to eat all those delicious Almond Joys.  Are you a fan of the Mounds?  Mmm, yummy.  I prefer the Almond Joys.  Mounds are okay, but...  Almond Joys, yeah.  That's delicious, that Almond Joys.  That's like Milky Way.  Who the hell, you know...  Twitchels, what do you think?  You can control this, right? 
[00:07:00]  Yep.  I think this is really embarrassing.  Why?  Because this is like the one thing nobody knew, and now it's...  Dude, you just took a shit on the air.  I used to eat...  You're embarrassed to eat candy.  What?  What?  You got a sweet tooth.  Just enjoy the almond flavors.  What's embarrassing about this?  The coconut's delicious.  I used to be 300 pounds, but I told you this.  Oh, no.  This is an obsession.  Oh, no.  Was it because of Almond Joys that got you that big?  Just tell yourself no.  All right, yeah, just say no.  You've only eaten, what, six or seven?  Can I leave?  No.  Watch on the air.  Just stand right there. 
[00:07:30]  You can leave if you can get past the death squad.  Guys, he usually throws up after he eats them, so he's certainly not going to gain any weight.  Oh, he's still on the line?  Yeah, he's still here.  How many does he eat before he ralphs?  Hey, Dan, how about tossing me one of those delicious Almond Joys?  He'll definitely do seven bags.  Wait, Jimmy's eating more than...  These are interesting.  They're very tasty.  I've had four myself.  Did you?  It's amazing.  Sam, what is it you like about the Almond Joys so much?  They just make me feel like everything's okay.  I don't know why, but I have to eat them all. 
[00:08:00]  I can't leave any of these delicious treats.  They're nice.  They're delicious.  I cannot leave them uneaten.  Yeah.  Two at a time.  Come on, Twitch.  You chew the coconut.  Danny, how many has he eaten?  Oh, he's licking it.  He's licking it.  He's trying not to eat it.  You lick it and smell it.  Gary Coleman.  How many has he eaten?  He's had seven right there.  Seven.  But they're starting to grab at them a little faster.  That's eight.  That's eight.  I just popped two at a time. 
[00:08:30]  Yum.  They're going to get wasted and thrown away.  Oh, yeah.  Feel it, man.  Feel it take you over.  Feel it take you over.  Bill's a hypnotist.  I think he could control this one.  You could control this one, right?  His eyes are rolling into the back of his head.  You could control this, right?  Heroin high.  Sugar rush.  I thought you liked me.  There's 20.  I thought you liked me.  We're giving you candy.  There's 20 unwrapped in front of him.  At least.  Yeah.  You can do it with people you like.  Oh, he's got three at a time. 
[00:09:00]  Oh.  Oh, he's gone now.  He's gone.  He's gone now.  He's throwing three in his mouth at a time.  That's when you do that one.  He looks like a chipmunk.  Yeah.  This is nothing for Rogan, though.  He's seen people eat and puke.  I hope I don't have to see that anymore.  I hope that show's done.  Yeah, right?  Enough of the puking.  The problem is I'll keep doing it.  If they keep offering me money, I'll show up.  Yeah.  I'll keep doing it.  Hey, what does the table read like for that show?  There's no table read.  There's no rehearsal whatsoever.  The table read is me and my trailer getting high as giraffe pussy. 
[00:09:30]  That's the table read.  And then they just bring in the helicopters and the people and you just stand out there.  Sometimes I'm so high that I don't even, like, I can't even read the script.  They give me, like, a script of, like, what the stunt is.  And sometimes I'm so high I start tripping out on words, like, I just go, how weird is  it?  We all agree these little symbols mean a certain thing.  You know, I think.  I go, man, think about it, man.  Isn't, like, communication kind of like a form of telepathy?  And I'm making noises with my mouth and you're reading my fucking mind. 
[00:10:00]  That's fucked up.  That's the kind of shit I start thinking.  And then, you know, sometimes I'm in the middle of this whole thing and the helicopters are  flying overhead and I'm looking at it and I'm just like, I can't even fucking believe  this is a job.  This is so bizarre.  So much more fun when I'm high.  Oh, man.  Are you feeling the paper?  I wonder what kind of tree this was.  This used to be a fucking tree.  Who was the first guy that figured out how to make paper out of a fucking tree? 
[00:10:30]  Who was the first guy to eat a lobster?  I did the lobster thing once.  So that was food.  That was a brave soul.  Oh, man.  Twitchels, how many Almond Joys are you up to?  I don't fucking know.  They're good.  Well, Danny knows.  Danny?  They're really good.  He's chewing 12 right now.  Oh.  God, you freak me out with that whole symbols and telepathy through just making  sounds.  It is.  It is.  Wow, if I was high, that would freak me out for hours. 
[00:11:00]  You're making little mouth noises.  You might as well just be going, I go, I go, I go, I go.  Yeah.  And that means something.  You reach into your culturally sanctioned dictionary and you go, okay, I know what he's  saying.  Okay, I know what you're thinking.  Let's go to Reno.  Never mind.  He's in Mississippi, actually.  What's up, Reno?  Hey, boys.  Just welcome back.  I kind of dig the free FM thing.  Yeah?  And, yeah, I just wanted to say hi to Caddy Daddy and Joe and Bill.  Hey.  And I was actually going to give props to Joe. 
[00:11:30]  And, I mean, this is not a shot by no means whatsoever, but news radio, still love it.  I was still running on syndication.  I wish I could find it somewhere.  Thanks, man.  It was a fun show to do.  You guys did a great job and some great comics, man.  Yeah, you guys rock.  Thank you, man.  And I'm kissing a little last this morning.  Yes.  That's all right.  That's right.  All right.  Thank you.  Coach, how are you doing over there? 
[00:12:00]  I'm doing great.  How do they taste?  They taste delicious.  Why are you compelled to just keep eating them?  He's fondling it.  I don't even want to get in the story now.  I'm really distraught.  Why are you distraught?  When I was about 10, my mom bought a bunch of these around Halloween time, and she wouldn't  let me have any of them.  And I told her that all I wanted was a few, and she fucking said no, and I got mad.  So. 
[00:12:30]  They emptied all of them.  Show mother.  Shame her.  Shame her?  You know, it's like, I'm so, it's like, God fucked me with Chirachi.  He fucked me with OCD.  I'm not bitter.  Come on.  God fuck me.  I'm not bitter.  We need that on a t-shirt.  God fucked me, but I'm not bitter.  I'm not bitter.  It's just another thing that I have to throw my wife.  God, we could sell a lot of those t-shirts.  How do you go into a store where those things are?  Because he hasn't had one when he's in the store.  Yeah.  Don't get me wrong.  I've had plenty before, but I don't have a whole enforcement of them in front of me 
[00:13:00]  at each time.  Yeah, there's bags and bags on them.  You don't have to eat all of them.  Just leave some.  Leave some uneaten and untouched.  So it was the day before Halloween, and I found out where she hit them, and I got them  out of the cabinet, and I started eating them all.  Now it's like part of my OCD thing.  I try to avoid them, but they're just good.  And it's like, sometimes it calms me down.  My tits kind of slow down a little bit, and it's almost like a sick way of healing. 
[00:13:30]  You're making me want to eat one.  You've got a whole handful now.  It's bringing back memories, I guess.  Bury the shame.  Bringing back memories, how good it felt back then.  Opening that bag and finding it.  Opening up that bag and going, oh, wow.  You'll show her.  Yep.  She can't hide it from you.  Not one.  I wanted just one.  That's all you wanted.  That's all I wanted.  She said no to me.  That's a fucking bitch.  I love my mom.  Fucking bitch.  I love my mom.  What a whore.  Seriously.  Why wouldn't she let you have one?  It was Halloween time.  What'd she think was going to happen? 
[00:14:00]  She wanted to save them for the trick-or-treaters.  Fuck the trick-or-treaters.  She cared about them more than you?  Yeah, right.  She loved the trick-or-treaters a little more than you.  Exactly.  Hey, Joe, could I have one of mothers' hidden treasures?  Oh, thanks.  They're delicious.  I'm going to have one, too.  I'm enjoying it.  I don't even want any more, but I want more.  It's kind of nutritious, too.  I mean, it's got a nut.  Nuts are high in protein.  There's coconut in there.  That's like a plant or something.  Oh, yeah, a little chocolate.  Just hold it to your nose and smell it. 
[00:14:30]  As far as candy goes, this is probably the best for you.  Oh, the coconut?  Coconut.  You ever actually touch it to your nose?  You touch the skin like the nose and upper lip skin?  Yeah.  Danny, how many has he eaten?  16.  He's got 17.  Well, there's 17, and 18 is actually in his hand as well.  God damn, they're good.  Yeah, they're really good.  Jimmy, how many have you eaten?  36.  Yeah, Jimmy's keeping right up on him.  Jimmy.  Jimmy's getting pulled right into this.  This isn't part of the Fat Smash diet, you know? 
[00:15:00]  Yes, it is.  Yeah, when are you starting the Fat Smash diet?  I started today.  This is like a little asterisk.  I had a few Almond Joys.  I looked at Rogan eating one.  I'm like, well, Joe's having one.  Like, you know, two men with the same workout regimen  are going to eat some Almond Joys.  Two men treating themselves because they've been working out so hard.  Yeah, exactly.  Preparing for fights, you know.  Joe and I just treating ourselves with some candy.  Just a little bit.  Twitchels, is your sponsor going to call?  Hmm?  Is your sponsor going to call? 
[00:15:30]  You got like an AA?  I don't have a sponsor.  Fuck them.  Hey, Pat.  We want to thank you for letting us know about this.  Oh, don't do that.  Oh, it's absolutely my pleasure.  Thanks, Pat.  Anything else you know about him, let us know on a future show.  Oh, yeah, I'll be checking in with other little OCD tidbits on my man there.  Jim Norton, you got any references from New Asians?  And if they're unwrapped, they'll probably eat more.  Why?  They're unwrapped.  Because they're right in front of him, and he knows they'll be wasted.  Yeah, they're all unwrapped.  He can't stand to think of them wasted and thrown out and unloved and uneaten. 
[00:16:00]  And I don't blame you.  He's an environment.  He's Catholic.  Let's say hi to Eric in New Jersey.  You can't waste food.  That's for real.  You can't waste food.  Eric.  It's so good.  Hey, Eric.  What's up?  Listen, I just wanted to ask Twitchels.  What does his mother feel like when he's getting all this abuse by you?  Does she want to just come over to the studio with a shotgun and shoot you guys?  My mother's very supportive.  I love her.  And she...  You called her a whore.  Supports what I do.  Oh.  You did call her a whore there.  I was very disappointed.  Did you ever mush those almond joys when you smacked them against your face? 
[00:16:30]  I was just angry when I was thinking about it.  That's all I wanted was one.  And it's just...  I dwell on it when I keep thinking about it.  Just one.  Just one.  That's all I wanted.  What about your father?  What does your father feel about this abuse?  My dad's a Vietnam vet.  He was sprayed with Asian orange and numb.  He's like fucking...  I'm trying to think of a comparison here.  He's like a Gomer Pyle mixed with Steve Urkel.  He's so nice, but he's kind of dull.  I love my dad.  I'm not making fun of him.  But if you met my family, I swear to God, you would understand a lot. 
[00:17:00]  You just wanted one.  This is becoming a real thing, man.  All right, Eric.  Don't touch me.  Don't touch him, Eric.  He just wants one.  Why are you touching him?  Why are you touching him?  Who do you think was more supportive, your dad or your mother?  They're both supportive.  I love my parents.  I really do.  I love my parents.  Did you ever have feelings like you don't love them?  No.  Never.  If your mom were to let you just have that one, though.  I mean, when I was a kid, I was angry.  You know, when they wouldn't let me have what I wanted.  Could have just had one.  Why are you splitting them in half now?  Why are you asking so many questions? 
[00:17:30]  Ooh.  He gets a little attitude.  He gets some sugar in.  Look at that.  Yeah, why are you?  No offense.  Leave him alone.  No offense.  Let him eat his almond joys.  He's kind of changed.  He is changing.  He's changing.  It's the sugar.  He is.  He's not twitching.  He's getting a glare.  A glare with a twitch.  I know.  Can you throw me one of those delicious treats?  They're very good.  Jimmy, enough.  We might as well just give him.  Twitchell's is generous with his almond joys, though.  He's not selfish.  Thank you.  He shares.  We might as well know there's five bags in front of him.  He's got his dad's three-mile stare right now. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  We might as well give Jimmy his own bag at this point.  I just want Nathaniel to once in a while.  Wasn't there a guy in San Francisco that killed somebody and blamed it on eating Twinkies?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Twinkie defense.  Yeah.  Did that fly?  I don't think so.  I feel like it did.  You know what's funny?  Initially, that makes sense.  You ever see a bag of almond joys come apart like that?  A whole box of those, I'd do something fucked up.  Hold on.  That spongy shit.  Just swallow slow.  That's got to be the worst thing for you ever.  Those things were never good, either. 
[00:18:30]  No.  Damn.  I used to always buy them.  My brother used to fight over them.  Like, these things sucked.  Twinkies?  Danny, how many?  23.  That's not that many, though.  There's so many more to eat.  Look at his face.  23?  Look sick.  How many come in a bag?  Well, there's only about another 20 in front of him.  He's going to puke.  No, he's not.  For sure he's going to puke.  No, he won't puke.  He did when he was a little boy, I bet you.  Did you puke when you were a little boy?  When it happened initially.  I bet you did.  You're going to puke today, buddy.  Did you puke into your mother's purse?  27.  Just to get her back?  Just wanted one. 
[00:19:00]  Dude, 27 come in a bag.  In one bag?  No, you almost ate a whole bag.  He only wanted one.  That's all he ate when he was a boy.  Just wanted one.  All mother had to do was give him one.  Is that really a harsh reply?  Absolutely not.  I don't think it is.  Completely.  And I think you're justified to lash out at her right now.  Yeah, I'll let.  I can't stress enough.  I love my parents.  But you know what?  If your kid wants a little piece of candy, and always ask him for one, then I think you  should oblige.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Especially when he does that.  Chris has a very good idea.  Chris in North Carolina. 
[00:19:30]  Chris?  Hey, ONA, you guys are awesome.  Hey, I want to see if little Twitchels would bob for Almond Joys on Jimmy Norton's crotch.  That's a great idea.  Stupid.  He's already eating Almond Joys.  Why does my cock have to be involved?  I already have nuts in my mouth.  He already has nuts in his mouth.  Yeah, give this bit somewhere to go.  We got to build.  That was Twitchels' best line, and it just slipped right by everybody.  Yeah.  The mic wasn't on the mic.  What else is new?  Because Eric was fucking around. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, what was it?  He said, I already have nuts in my mouth.  Yeah.  Eric just shook his eyes.  Let's go to James in Florida.  James?  Hey, I got an idea, man.  Make Twitchels eat Almond Joys, and then make him jump until he pukes.  No, he doesn't have to jump.  Ramon, bring Twitchels an abortion.  Why, sir?  You're making me hate, Steve, from Yellowstone.  That's the funny guy from the tire store.  Funniest guy at Sears.  He's not going to jump.  He's already jumped. 
[00:20:30]  Now he's just eating.  He's not going to jump.  He looks sick.  It has calmed down.  No, he's mellow.  It mellows him out.  He doesn't jump.  Uh-oh.  He's going to hurl.  That's gag one.  That's gag one.  He just eats.  He just had his first gag.  He looks like Fred Gwynn right now.  He's going to fucking chuck like a broken fire hydrant.  Chew slow.  Is that Fred Gwynn?  Yes, it is.  Chew slow.  He looks like a baseball player right now.  A lot of chew in his mouth.  A lot more to go.  Don't jump.  He's got his Game 7 face on.  No kidding.  Don't jump.  I'm back.  I'm predicting projectile vomit, and I'm getting out of the fucking way. 
[00:21:00]  This is like that scene from that movie.  What was that Stephen King movie, the pie-eating contest?  What was that?  Thinner?  Was that what it was?  Thinner?  No.  Oh, Stand By Me.  Yeah, it was Stand By Me.  He's not twitching.  Oh, my God.  How many are we up to?  Well, he's got to finish one more, because that'll be a full bag.  A full bag, just like when he was young.  You don't want to waste any of these.  See?  But I had a few, so it's not technically a full bag.  Yeah.  Jump.  You had a few out of my bag, though.  Jump.  Jump.  You don't want to jump.  Never jump while you're eating so many. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, wow.  Don't jump.  Just don't even think about jumping.  He's not even jumping.  No, he won't jump.  He's not even talking anymore.  He's got a bad feeling about this.  He's not twitching.  Twitch, you want to jump?  No, he doesn't want to jump.  He's just enjoying some mom and joys.  Hey, if I was young, maybe you'd feel better if you jump, you know?  Get back to like a normal schedule.  There you are.  Yum, yum, yum.  Yum.  That's it.  French kiss it.  There you go.  Yum.  Yum.  Oh, wow, look at that.  It does mellow out his tics, though.  I got to be honest.  I used to get really grossed out when people throw up, but now it doesn't fade at all.  It doesn't even bother you, right?  People can throw up right in front of me. 
[00:22:00]  It's just funny now.  Remember when you were in high school and the fat kid used to puke in the hallway and  everybody would throw up?  Yeah.  You'd smell it.  You'd be like, yeah.  Not me.  I could stand in light.  Now you're so desensitized.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Vomit.  You've watched those Brazilian films where they have fucking Roman showers?  Yeah, what is that?  They're vomit on each other.  What's up with the fart video, the fart porn?  Have you seen that?  Yeah, they're not real, I don't think.  You don't think so?  No, they're awful.  It's pretty real to me.  Somebody wants to know how many calories he's eaten.  That's a very good question.  That's got to be 50 or 60.  His pancreas is sweating. 
[00:22:30]  He's getting a murderous look on his face.  All right, here we go.  Someone who's good at math here.  Amount per serving, 200 calories.  How many in a serving?  Three serving size, three pieces.  Oh, that's not bad.  So how many have you done?  I could do this math.  About 30?  He's up to 30?  So 10 servings, let's say?  So he's got about 2,000 calories in him.  2,000 calories of almond joys.  That's all right.  I'm telling you, it's coming right across the car.  Not on the console.  Oh, my God.  I've been puked on twice in my life. 
[00:23:00]  Hold on, Eric.  Yes.  Hold on.  Every once by a chip.  Once by my brother and once on a public bus.  He looks...  He has that...  Bad things come in threes.  I'm getting the fuck out of the way.  No, he's okay.  He's just chewing slow.  He's got a fucking hurl.  Hold on.  Eric has a good idea.  Slow, mellow.  Eric in San Diego, what's up?  Ah!  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  I was thinking he sounds a little distraught there.  Maybe you should read one of Erock's tender sentiments.  Sure.  No time for tender sentiments, sir.  We're businesses at hand.  Could Twitchells read one of your tender sentiments? 
[00:23:30]  He's feeling a little bad about himself right now.  You know what?  I'll give it to you because you've been putting your fingers in your mouth.  I'll let him read it, okay?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  I won't even look at it.  Dan, hand Lewis his tender sentiment.  No one will ever be quite like you.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  The world can...  And how about rewarding this good boy with an almond joy? 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  Give this boy his just desserts.  I believe mom would have gave you an almond joy.  Mother would have given you at least one for that.  If she cared.  Yeah.  If she really cared.  Saying no.  How do you not want an almond joy when you see a bag of them?  Why do they do that to kids?  Every little boy deserves an almond joy.  I think you should just try three or four at a time.  I don't think one at a time is getting in there.  Because the mouth is not full, you're saying, Joe.  Yeah.  I mean, you've got to really get the full taste of the experience.  What are we up to?  He's got 29 in his head.  He's got 29. 
[00:24:30]  It was 35 minutes ago.  Yeah, it was.  We were rounding it out.  Oprah's rounding it out for calories.  Yeah, for calories.  So you're almost up to 2,000 calories.  Fill that mouth up with chocolate and just swallow, swallow.  Do you have a saliva buildup yet?  That buildup do you get when you're on a boat?  Jim, what was that line from?  When you're on a boat.  Fill that mouth up with chocolate.  You're looking at the horizon, trying to concentrate.  I've used it before in some way or another.  Feel that weird?  That queasiness washes over you. 
[00:25:00]  Are you fighting it?  Oh, it's going to happen.  Hey, Than, are there any uneaten Almond Joys?  I got five bucks for this E-Rock pukes first.  There's like a pile of this floating Almond Joys shit in a sea of Red Bull.  And it's just, it's sick, but I want more.  Go ahead.  It'll just mellow it out.  It'll be because of her.  I know.  Your ass is going to do like a broken main pipe.  You have to do this.  She's going to.  If she were to let you have one.  Go ahead, just pop it in your mouth.  You don't want it to melt in your hand. 
[00:25:30]  It never would have happened.  Pop it in your mouth.  It's going to look like one of those exploding cigars.  Oh.  He's not even trying to be over that fucking barrel.  No, he's okay.  You're okay, Louis.  You're not going to puke.  Is that better?  Yeah, that's much better.  No, put it down.  You got to put it down because of the camera.  Put it down.  Put it down.  Put it down so you can get a good view of it.  Oh, a whole fistful.  A whole fistful.  Those are good, Louis.  God.  That's delicious.  They're good, right?  That's wonderful.  Nothing better than an Almond Joy.  They are delicious. 
[00:26:00]  It just soothes your soul, doesn't it?  Come on, Twitch.  Stick them all in there.  Stick them all in.  A mouthful.  Come on.  I double dare you.  A mouthful.  Jimmy, what would...  We'll let you lick the wrappers afterwards.  Oh, there you go.  Fill that mouth.  Oh, there it is.  Three at a time.  Fill that emptiness.  That's right.  Fill that emptiness, man.  The naughtiness of opening that bag when you weren't supposed to.  Yes, fill that emptiness.  You found it and you ate them all.  I feel the puke coming on.  I feel the hurl coming, people. 
[00:26:30]  Just swallow a little at a time.  I am an expert on people throwing up.  Fill that stomach with love.  That's right.  Fill that stomach with love.  Oh, God.  I am in a world of shit.  That's the look.  That's the look.  Hi, Joker.  Are we getting pictures of this?  Why aren't you stomping Private Piles Tasty Treats out?  This is my rifle.  This is my gun.  Don't let that go. 
[00:27:00]  Eat it.  There you go.  It almost fell out of your mouth.  Good boy.  Hold it in.  Danny, how many are we up to?  We're looking at 34.  Wait.  32 Almond Joy Full Metal Jackets.  They're paying for it.  You eat it.  Okay.  Twitchell's has eaten 38 Almond Joys.  Is Private Twitchell allowed to have Almond Joys in his footlocker?  Don't let it fall out of your mouth.  You've got to swallow it first. 
[00:27:30]  No, no, no, no.  Hurl!  Oh, that is disgusting.  Push it deep.  I didn't need it, Twitchell's.  They're paying for it.  Oh, the glassy eyes.  You know what would keep that in?  A brand new Almond Joy.  I'm going to throw up.  No, a brand new Almond Joy.  Oh, here it comes, baby.  Come on.  Private Twitchell.  Infantry.  You made it.  You're wasting precious Almond Joys that you would have really enjoyed when you were a  little kid and your mother wouldn't give them to them.  Then you're spitting them out.  Oh!  He went back.  He spit it out into the trash can. 
[00:28:00]  Reached into the trash can.  Filled with trash.  Picked up the Almond Joy mound pile and shoved it right back in his mouth.  Yeah, that can't stay in the garbage.  It can't.  It's wasted.  What are you going to do with that?  It's wasted.  It's wasted.  That goes against the whole OCD thing, I'm thinking.  Absolutely.  You're right.  I like the waste.  He doesn't like to waste.  He's a good boy.  When he was little, he wanted every bit of that Almond Joy, and he got sick.  Mommy wouldn't let him.  Take another one.  And on the bright side of things, this has cured you of that whole jump thing. 
[00:28:30]  Jump.  See?  You better not have any more Almond Joy.  You've had enough.  No more.  He's not jumping.  You say jump, he just stands there.  No more Almond Joys for you.  No more.  You've had enough.  Twitchels, I think you should stop.  I don't think you should have any more Almond Joys.  I'm serious.  I think you should stop.  I'm serious.  I haven't said shit today.  He gets an attitude.  It does get an attitude with you.  I mean, the sugar rush.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, something about 4,000 calories.  Yeah.  Gets you a little attitude. 
[00:29:00]  No, man.  Just one more.  Just one more.  And stop.  Don't waste it.  You already chewed it.  You can't waste it.  If there's a God in heaven, he's going to fucking yak these up right now.  Get me a bucket.  I'm going to throw up.  A Woffer Thin Mint.  That look is pretty damn scary.  Yeah.  Let a boy enjoy his Almond Joy.  So is your mama.  We're going to have to get him on Tyra. 
[00:29:30]  Almond Joy's got nuts, man.  Don't.  Yeah, I bet Tyra could cure this.  He's got one leg up now.  Yeah, he's eating and enjoying these, man.  Get filled up with Almond Joy.  What is he up to, Danny?  37.  No way.  A lot of people would say that is too much Almond Joy for one little boy, but I don't think it is.  It's just... 
[00:30:00]  Slow.  Slow, Louis.  Slow.  You're kidding, right?  This is going to be like therapy.  He's going to get over us there.  Is there a Guinness Book of World Records on Almond Joy's?  Did I do it again?  Yes, you did.  I'm the fucking worst.  What did you say?  Nothing.  I don't say that.  Okay, tell me later.  Slow, Louis.  Slow.  Don't drool it.  You're wasting it.  It's drooling.  You're wasting it.  Keep it in.  Ew. 
[00:30:30]  Wow.  He's scary.  Look at that look.  Why?  He knows.  Hello.  He knows.  He knows.  Private Joker.  It's good.  Jimmy knows.  Fuck it's good.  I know it is.  It's all good.  I know.  I fucking love it.  I know you do.  It's all right.  And you know what?  You deserve it, too.  You're weirding me out.  Wow.  If I wanted one, it was one, man.  Just one.  It's fucking hard to ask.  Whoa.  No.  There you go.  There you go.  Now he's punching them on the table.  Oh, boy. 
[00:31:00]  I'm still eating them.  I would have been so angry.  Like, when I was little, if I wanted Halloween candy, and there was a whole bag of it, I would  have been so angry.  Furious.  Furious.  The anger I would have felt at not being, it would have made me feel angry.  She loves every other kid in the neighborhood but you?  Right.  Exactly.  Meanwhile, he hasn't had any Tourette's since he's been doing it.  I know.  No.  I think we've cured a lot.  We cured the jumping thing and we cured the whole Tourette's thing.  It's all just a little sugar.  Evidently, the cure to Tourette's is to eat Almond Joys. 
[00:31:30]  Fucking Almond Joys.  Don't touch him, Eric.  Let a boy enjoy his Almond Joy.  Oh, you're wasting it.  Don't waste it.  You're wasting it in the trash can, man.  Somebody.  Those were really good Almond Joys.  Some of the Almond Joys.  There's so many.  Back into the trash.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, he's pushing him.  All right, this is so disgusting.  He's pushing him back into his mouth.  It's coming out of his mouth.  It looks like shit and then he pushes it back into his mouth.  Somebody doesn't want to waste it.  What's wrong with a boy who enjoys his treats without wasting them? 
[00:32:00]  The anger I would have felt at not being able to have any candy.  Twitchell, she was going to give candy to 30 other boys she didn't even know.  And girls.  And girls, exactly.  Dirty, filthy girls.  The little sluts.  Yeah.  She hates you.  My Almond Joys.  Yeah.  They're mine.  What do you want to do with them, huh?  With the girls or the Almond Joys?  With the girls.  Do you want to punish them?  He's getting another one.  I bet you wanted to eat all their Almond Joys, didn't you?  Send them home without them.  How come the jump thing isn't working on you now? 
[00:32:30]  How come jump isn't working on you now?  There's nothing that fills you like an Almond Joy.  There's nothing more important than this.  This is weird.  His Tourette's has been cured.  They really are.  It's so bad, I think it's...  You're doing a bit, but I know you're not now.  There's a million dumb things going on here.  So where did he eat these Almond Joys when he was a kid?  He locked himself somewhere.  In a closet?  Where'd you hide?  Where'd you hide?  Oh, he just sat down.  That's never good.  Put him in a cabinet. 
[00:33:00]  You found him, though, right?  You looked and you looked and you found him.  And putting him in a cabinet with that door closed was like her love that was closed off from you.  You had best square your ass away and start shitting me, Tiffany Cuplix.  Or I will definitely fuck you up.  Is he feeling satisfied?  Not yet.  No, there's more.  He's getting there, though.  He feels better, but there's more.  Why, you little maggot!  You make me want to vomit!  There's more.  Isn't there, Twitchels? 
[00:33:30]  There's always more, Lewis.  Slow.  You want to promote your website?  AlmondJoy.com.  Laughter by Lewis.  So much for having Hershey's as a sponsor.  LaughterbyLew.com.  AlmondJoy.com.  Wish we had that song, AlmondJoy's Got Nuts.  Mounds don't.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Sometimes you don't.  AlmondJoy's Got Nuts. 
[00:34:00]  Mounds don't.  Wow, he's kind of twitching.  The twitching's starting to come back a little, too.  No, that's all right.  Oh, my God.  Don't puke.  You're going to waste all of it, man.  You'll have to read it.  AlmondJoy's Got Nuts.  Mounds don't.  Mounds don't.  Jesus.  What's in there?  Heroin?  Nah, he knows.  He knows.  He knows.  He's satisfying an emptiness right now.  There she is.  All he wanted was one.  That's very reasonable.  Every boy wants one. 
[00:34:30]  AlmondJoy's Got Nuts.  How hot is that Pamela Rogers chick?  That chick that fucked that little kid?  Oh, she's fantastic.  Fantastic.  So hot.  He was not slouch either.  Can't blame me to one of them.  Uh-oh, we got some.  Ah!  Twitch started dry heaving toward Eric.  That's the thing about him.  There's a vengeance with his puking.  Yep.  No, he's trying to hold it back. 
[00:35:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, God.  And he pukes and he goes back in and grabs two more.  Have some more.  Oh, no.  Replace it.  I taste the Red Bull.  He missed.  Talk to Phil.  I taste the Red Bull.  It stinks.  He tastes the Red Bull.  I taste the Red Bull.  Dude, it's puking.  I taste the Red Bull.  I taste the fucking Red Bull.  I taste the Red Bull.  Oh, my God.  It's the AlmondJoy.  It smells like puke and Red Bull at the same time.  Look at Rogan's just hanging out.  Like, I've seen this shit with horse assholes. 
[00:35:30]  This doesn't smell nearly as bad as horse assholes.  This is nothing to you, right?  Yeah, I've seen...  Now we need contestants to eat that, and then we got a contest.  Roaches, animal cocks.  I've seen it all.  All that matters now, though, is just keep replacing the AlmondJoy.  That's cool.  You threw up about six of them, so you got to have a couple more just to get back to where you were.  Danny, what's the number up to?  I know he's puked a little out.  Yeah, the count's kind of off.  I don't know how...  But how many has he attempted to eat?  Uh, five, seven, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, thirty, twenty...  Forty-one.  Forty-one.  Forty-one.  Oh, no way. 
[00:36:00]  Forty-one?  He's still chewing.  Oh.  That's, uh, let's see.  He's a good boy.  Thirty-four.  He's a good boy.  Ah, there's drool coming out of his mouth.  It's chocolate drool.  Thirty-four hundred calories, about?  He's a good boy, and he deserves this little treat.  Oh, no, no, not thirty-four.  When's the last time he did this?  Probably a long time, right?  You treat yourself.  Watch it, watch it.  No, he's okay.  Just swallow it.  Twenty-seven hundred calories, about.  That thick, heavy swallow.  It's thick, and it's heavy.  He's trying to fucking puke on people.  No, he's not.  If you're gonna puke, can you puke, uh, in front of the camera? 
[00:36:30]  He's keeping it down.  He's not trying to puke.  He's trying to hold it in.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He doesn't want to waste it.  Oh, no.  You're all right, right, Twitchell?  Sure he is.  Here, listen to this.  This'll soothe.  The garbage pail.  Get the garbage pail.  God damn it.  That's okay.  That's a lot of throw-up over there.  That's okay.  Give him an almond joy already.  He doesn't feel good.  This is, uh, unsanitary work condition.  It certainly is.  I don't think CBS radio would be going for us. 
[00:37:00]  There you go.  No.  These motherfuckers over at X-Navis don't care about your health.  What?  Oh, God, it does just reek.  It smells good, like almond joy candy.  Please hit the garbage pail.  No, he's just enjoying it.  He, like, loses control, and the garbage pail falls over.  No, he's trying to hold it in.  His body wretches.  He's trying to hold it in.  He doesn't want to waste it.  Oh.  It looks like a German shepherd had diarrhea over here.  You don't eat a whole bag of that yumminess and try to waste it.  You want to eat and save all of it.  You've got to see the logs on the floor. 
[00:37:30]  Twitchell, what's the point?  Twitchell.  You've got to see the logs on the floor.  Did you want to puke on your mother?  No, he wanted to eat it all up.  No.  Eat it all up.  Why waste it on her?  How good were they when you were eating them when you were a kid?  They were delicious, right?  Naughty treat.  Right?  You get me?  Sneak a treat.  You get me?  You get me?  You fucking get me?  I get you, man.  I get you.  Please stop looking at me like that.  What's the sugar do to him?  He's already thrown up, and yet he's eaten more.  Yeah.  Because there's many more to be eaten, Joe. 
[00:38:00]  What is he going to do?  Waste them?  Leave them for other boys and girls?  They're his.  He's got to eat what's on the table in front of him.  He didn't see me with the rationalization.  What's the truth?  They're his.  They were bought for him.  There you go.  It's like every little boy's fantasy to have a whole bag of almond joys all for you.  Danny's covering up his nose and mouth with his shirt.  It's kind of good that I have a cold.  We got a picture on the floor.  Give him a napkin, Kev.  Stop being so selfish. 
[00:38:30]  Give the boy a napkin.  I'm sorry for my man.  That's okay.  You're just enjoying.  Got to give it up to Child Star.  He's right in there with that camera.  Child Star.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  That was petrifying.  I'm not looking at him.  I can't even look at him anymore.  Hey, somebody move Erock's box of tender sentiments.  I like Rogan.  He's just sitting there reading the paper like he's in a little breakfast nook.  Rogan seems so much worse.  Wait to have a saw-cooked egg. 
[00:39:00]  Joe's like, ah.  That's the money shot right there, people.  That's it, buddy.  That was it.  That was it.  Hold on.  That was it.  And he goes back in.  Oh, stop.  All right.  Even Joe.  Even Joe is witsy.  I almost puked.  He just picked up an Almond Joy that was covered in puke, and he shoved it in his mouth.  That one made me try.  There you go.  I am not invincible when it comes to throwing up. 
[00:39:30]  And I just cut a gander.  You can't break me.  He just broke me.  Danny's going to puke.  Oh, Danny should stop.  I've got to admit, all I smell is Almond Joy.  Who needs Halloween?  Who needs Halloween?  He just broke me.  He just broke me.  Oh, God.  No one needs it.  All right, listen.  Look at that Almond Joy on the console being wasted.  Let me tell you.  Dude, he threw up on one of those Almond Joys and then shoved it back in his mouth.  Whose camera is that?  Joe, look at this shot.  Oh, get it to Steve immediately.  That's got to go on opanthony.com.  Show Rogan that shot. 
[00:40:00]  It's perfect.  You've got to see the shot one of your boys got, man.  One of the death squad got the...  He's got a perfect picture.  Oh, look out, look out.  This looks photoshopped.  It looks like there's a gopher jumping into his mouth.  Look at this picture.  That's great.  It looks like a fucking animal is running into his mouth.  At light speed. 
[00:40:30]  That's the greatest puke picture ever.  It's all over the...  It's perfect.  It's all over the studio.  All over the console, right where Hawk sits.  Hawk is not happy.  Oh, look at Eric.  He looks like a rape victim.  Grab those CDs.  He almost got me.  Grab some more napkins.  How about some Almond Joys for this boy?  How about some puke-covered Almond Joys?  There's a few of those over there that are still pukey.  That's all.  He doesn't...  No more.  Just throw it out.  We're done.  Just get rid of those...  Fuck you. 
[00:41:00]  I tell you when you're done.  Get rid of us.  That's right.  Lewis tells you.  Spider.  Yeah.  Hey, Pat.  Thanks a lot for this little tidbit, by the way.  Oh, my pleasure.  I've been on the line the whole time.  He's been enjoying it.  He's...  Pat, I gotta thank you.  He's been on the line for 43 minutes.  I gotta thank you, Pat.  I like these Almond Joys.  It took a while, but at least there was a big payoff.  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't going anywhere until the money shot came.  The fucking gopher.  The gopher.  Hey, can we get that picture up online, Steve? 
[00:41:30]  Where's...  Could someone give that to Steve?  That picture has got to go online immediately.  It's actually...  Do you have a cable?  Yeah, he'll have a cable.  Can you stop fucking feeding him those things, man?  I'm getting sick.  Here, Danny.  Brian, get that camera.  Hey, Jason in Virginia Beach.  What's up?  Hey, man.  That is the funniest damn bitch ever, man.  We're sitting here smoking the fattest joint.  You're smoking a joint?  Is it?  We're sitting here smoking a joint driving...  You got KB?  Is it KB?  I'm a joint shit.  Shut the fuck up and listen.  Is it KB? 
[00:42:00]  What's that?  Is it KB?  Are you smoking KB?  Killer blood.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  It's definitely time blood.  Joint or blunt?  Did you say blunt or joint?  It's a joint.  Oh, I get some blunts.  Yeah, I like blunts, but...  Candy's like his nutty professor, medicine.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, uh-oh.  Look out.  Watch out, Joe.  Joe.  Joe whips her out.  Yeah, dude.  That is so funny.  No, it's flying. 
[00:42:30]  Ah!  Oh, God, no.  That's just spit up, though.  That's not throw up.  Yeah, it's just a lot of it.  That photo was throw up.  That was real.  All the liquid.  In case you don't think this is real, go to openanthony.com in a little while.  The picture is now up, by the way, on myspice.com slash Jim Norton.  Eric in New York, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey, hey.  Listen, what would happen, would his OCD just kick in if you're just full of almond joy  and just take it away from him before the big climax?  What would happen? 
[00:43:00]  We got the big climax, but he refuses to stop eating.  Yeah, we think he's had an almond joy.  Just take it away from him.  See if you'll find Joe Rogan.  He's so sick right now, he can't even stand up.  He's sitting down.  Yeah, but he's still eating.  Hey, Opie, you want to do the math on how many calories he just puked up?  How many did he eat?  40-something?  Uh-oh.  I'd say close to 50.  His head's...  Close to 50?  His head's tilting back.  See, he throws up with his head back, so it fills up his mouth, and then it pours out 
[00:43:30]  of his mouth.  Because he's trying not to throw up.  Yeah, it's really sick.  Well, it smells like chocolate in here.  I love the smell of chocolate.  It smells like bile.  Yeah.  Delicious.  No reason to...  I know exactly what that smells like.  How odd.  Of course you do.  I've seen people...  They serve it.  Fair fact, their bile, actual animal bile.  Oh.  That's one of the ingredients that we make people drink.  No, no.  Hit the pail.  Get the pail.  Anywhere but the pail.  What the fuck?  That's disrespectful.  Disrespectful. 
[00:44:00]  You're puking right on my feet.  He's got to be nuts that he's puking so close to the dead squad.  Insane.  Yeah, you know what that's like?  That's like suicide by cop.  Yeah.  Just puke on a couple of UFC guys.  I'm sorry.  You didn't get me.  These guys will snap your neck.  Don't hurt me.  Yeah.  I don't think either one of them would grab him.  Look at how there's all that Red Bull in the puke.  You can see it in the puke.  I can't see the Red Bull.  Big Cav!  Big Cav, give him a napkin. 
[00:44:30]  Stop thinking about yourself.  Should we take a break?  I'm tapping out.  Yeah, let's take a break.  I got to take a piss and get out of this fucking room.  Yeah, we're going to take a break and continue.  You can continue eating if you have to.  Twitchels, but we have to take a break.  I know, I have that dry, pasty feeling in my mouth.  Want some mule juice?  Okay.  I'll meet you in the bathroom.  All right, we're going to step aside for a little while.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  This is Seth Rogen and Bill Hader from Superbad.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:45:00]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Who else is coming in today?  I don't have the list in front of me yet.  Maybe that's it.  The Tony Award nominated.  Right.  Stephen Lynch.  Oh, we also have...  Broadway star.  Director Davis Guggenheim.  Guggenheim.  Guggenheim.  From the...  What movie?  Does he have a museum?  What movie?  Why would we know what movie? 
[00:45:30]  Why would we know that?  Ben?  Al Gore movie.  Oh, that's Al Gore.  Oh, we'll have to get Steve in here.  I watched the movie.  I'm so glad I have a hybrid vehicle now.  And I'm thinking of getting another one.  Steve, over here?  Why are you against the environment?  Steve.  I'm not against the environment.  I'm against the BS that comes out of some people about the environment.  Or the importance or lack thereof of the environment and global warming and things that are happening. 
[00:46:00]  It's just the way it is.  Have you...  Look at the earth.  It constantly changes.  Whether we're here or not.  It just changes.  And a lot of the change is based on the life that inhabits this planet.  Whether it's dinosaurs or mammoths or early man.  What they do on this planet affects it somehow.  And the planet then changes, adapts, gets rid of some species.  Whatever it is.  We're just another one.  We happen to have a little more of a divine spark in our head so we can pull dirt out of the ground and make things that fly. 
[00:46:30]  Which is pretty amazing if you think about it.  And because of that divine spark, we're able to ruin the earth a lot faster than any other species has ever done.  It doesn't mean it's wrong.  Before us.  It doesn't mean it's wrong.  And we're not...  Who says we're ruining it?  Who says changing it is wrecking it?  Why does it have to remain like it was 10,000 years ago?  Why does it have to be the same?  I don't want to worry about getting a sunburn in January in New York City. 
[00:47:00]  That's why.  People got sunburns all the time.  That's why.  That basically, if you're concerned about the continual survival of people, then it would bug you.  But if you don't have a problem with dinosaurs were around and then they're not, we're around, they're not.  Do you know how long dinosaurs are around, too?  Yeah, but they weren't...  Millions upon millions.  It was their time.  Get off already.  And we've been around for a while.  Not that long, but...  Compared to the dinosaurs, not much at all.  Unless there's some cataclysmic event like a meteor that wipes out all the life on the planet, we'll be here for a long time. 
[00:47:30]  We'll figure it out.  We run out of fossil fuel.  Oh, my God, we're going to put on loincloths and run around?  Believe me, we'll figure something else out.  Steve, we'll figure it out.  That's how we're the laziest things on this planet.  That's what happens.  We wait until we need something.  Global warming, it's like a global term paper.  Like, what does this thing do?  You've got to have this done by 2011. 
[00:48:00]  Ah, wait.  Yeah, these next four years, it's like a weekend.  Global warming.  Do you honestly believe that the polar ice caps are going to melt enough where they show Florida is a little nub stick enough to...  Just stop it.  It is not going to happen.  Oh, it's going to happen.  This is going to be the audio.  Maybe thousands upon thousands of years.  When Earth takes its normal course of changing, because this planet changes.  You look at the original... 
[00:48:30]  He really sounds like he should have a lab coat on right now.  I have a microphone in front of me.  That's all I need.  Don't you know what that means?  That means he's an expert.  We have come to the conclusion that as long as you have a mic in front of you and you're broadcasting to more than just one person, you're an expert.  No matter what's coming out of your mouth.  This is the audio that's going to play as the water rises and all you hear is...  But if you're on TV, you need a microphone and a podium.  And a podium.  And a podium.  To lean on.  Hey, Jim in Washington, what's up?  Earth's days are numbered.  Yeah, Anthony, what about Stephen Hawking saying that the Earth's days are numbered? 
[00:49:00]  Earth's days are numbered.  I didn't tell you that that number was 8,633,000.  And that's still, you know, plenty of days to go.  The dinosaurs didn't put a hole in the ozone layer, though.  You know what I mean?  They were just kind of walking around eating leaves on each other.  And by the way, they are.  What do you think fossil fuels made of, my friend?  Dinosaurs. 
[00:49:30]  It's all their fault.  No, but it was in the ground.  And we took it out.  And we had the gumption to pull it out of the ground and make something that makes cars run.  They were plotting against us millions of years ago.  And we didn't even know it.  Instead of saying how bad everything we do is, why not look at how we can take rocks and things from trees and things out of the air and put them together and make something that flies?  It's amazing.  We're amazing.  We're an amazing species. 
[00:50:00]  So what?  A couple of spotted owls have to pay the ultimate price.  You ever heard a frog with this kind of arrogance?  Exactly.  This is why we already have enough statues of ourselves.  We've carved our faces in the sides of mountains.  We're wonderful.  We are the most amazing thing on this planet.  We stink.  We stink.  We stink.  We've been to the moon with stuff we built that was just sitting in the ground.  Rocks.  Who's we?  Rocks.  We.  A few guys.  A few guys have been to the moon.  Humans. 
[00:50:30]  They don't allow us to go to the moon.  We're locusts.  Hey.  We're locusts.  We're gypsy moth caterpillars.  We can continue this rant after the break.  All right.  After the break.  You guys are going to kill the show if we go way too long here.  The worst.  It's the worst.  Of the O.B. and Anthony show.  Steve's in studio.  I guess E-Rock was saying that through the instant message system, whatever, that Steve was losing  in his mind when Anthony was talking about the environment and that Earth's days are  not numbered.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Steve's very passionate about this.  I'm not very passionate. 
[00:51:00]  There's nothing wrong with being passionate, Steve.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'll back you on this one.  E-Rock.  He was saying that he was getting aggravated, Anthony, saying that New York City was going  to be underwater, and Jesus, Anthony, you don't know what you're talking about.  You watch too many movies.  No, I don't watch too many movies.  I'm not basing this on the Day After Tomorrow scenario.  You're basing it on the Al Gore movie?  Yes, entirely.  Oh, Jesus.  I inform all of my opinions on Al Gore documentaries.  Al Gore.  No, I just, you're such a smart guy, and when you start, you know.  Thank you, Steven.  And when you say things that are so completely contrary to what. 
[00:51:30]  To what's happening?  To what's happening.  Mm-hmm.  It infuriates me because it makes, somehow I think you're doing it because you know  it's going to get a rise out of people.  No.  No, not at all.  I'll tell you what it is.  Anthony has a different perspective on everything.  He doesn't give a crap what happens to this Earth after he's gone.  He's one of those guys.  But it's not after.  It's not after you're gone.  He doesn't really care.  It's not after you're gone.  It's happening now.  Do you honestly believe, let me tell you something.  Do you honestly believe if the ocean's levels and water levels on this globe rose to a point 
[00:52:00]  where, I'm not even talking about where they said the final point was, where, I swear to  you, I saw a clip of Florida and it's pretty much gone.  It's a little nub sticking off the bottom.  That's their projection.  Not even talking about that.  Okay.  I'm talking about if it rose to a point where people went like, wow, this, hey, excuse me,  Mr. President, the water's really rising.  Problem is, it's not going to happen immediately.  And that's the point that this movie, An Inconvenient Truth, makes. 
[00:52:30]  It doesn't happen immediately.  It happens over the course of 50 years.  Evolution doesn't happen immediately.  This planet doesn't change immediately.  It takes thousands of years, but it constantly changes.  And that's what this planet is a living kind of thing.  The vast majority of the populations of this planet live in coastal regions.  When all of a sudden you start filling those coastal regions up with water, you're going  to have people that, you're going to have a lot of displaced human beings that are 
[00:53:00]  I am, I know, but do you realize?  No, no, but there's another thing happening.  I see Anthony's point now.  This stuff will happen at such a slow pace that these people will be slowly moving out  of these areas and going elsewhere.  Steve, do you understand that they were primitive?  If you lost Florida a week from today, wow, that would be a really big deal.  However, in addition to that?  Matter of fact, New Orleans went under and it wasn't even a big deal in the end.  I mean, and people are like, oh, my God, how could you say that?  But look around, man.  Look at the big picture.  Look at the big picture. 
[00:53:30]  Look around.  They've got a Mardi Gras happening already.  Yeah, they relocated to Houston.  But imagine if hurricanes like Katrina started happening more frequently and all of a sudden  more cities started getting hit with those kind of hurricanes.  Then you've got more cities than just New Orleans.  Do you honestly, and you honestly believe that because we're doing what?  Nothing.  That we're making, no, no, we're obviously doing something bad.  Yeah.  Something bad.  Well, these people will just.  That is making hurricanes stronger.  How are we making hurricanes stronger?  I'll tell you exactly why.  All right. 
[00:54:00]  This is the way that heat from the sun hits the atmosphere historically.  It comes through the atmosphere, hits the planet, hits the oceans, hits the glaciers.  And most of that heat usually goes back up into space.  What's happening with the burning of fossil fuels and pollution is it's thickening up the  atmosphere.  And that heat, less of that heat is going back up into outer space and it's going back  into the earth and it's melting glaciers.  It's melting snow on mountaintops.  And all that water is, is, is causing the glaciers to melt, is causing, um, uh, you do know the 
[00:54:30]  whole planet was not the whole planet, but a lot of the Northern and Southern hemisphere  covered with ice, uh, really just about 10,000, 15,000 years ago, relatively short amount  of time in, in human, uh, uh, existence.  But, but, and, and, and what happened to those glaciers?  They pulled back.  Why?  Uh, uh, Oongugu's campfire was thrown off a little too much smoke. 
[00:55:00]  The rate at which, at the rate at which the climate of this, of this planet is, is rising  has happened so much faster over the last 20 years.  Has it?  Yeah.  That, that, that's.  I heard Al Gore say that the, the 10 hottest years so far in history have happened in the  last 12 years.  Sure, that's, that's one of the points he makes.  Doesn't, maybe that just happened?  No.  Don't you think more, no, this is just a coincidence.  Doesn't it just, can it, I like the whole philosophy too, that as the water's coming up, 
[00:55:30]  like, oh, excuse me, the water's starting to come in, we need to do something, all the  oil companies will just be like, yeah, okay, to hell with those billions of dollars.  Thank you.  Let's switch this on Monday.  Yeah, as the mediator, I can't, I can't go with your point.  Look, I can't.  Thank you.  The odds of that would be ridiculous.  I think his nonchalant attitude is irresponsible.  I think it's that, how long have we been, I think, I think it's arrogant to think that  we've been keeping weather records for how long, really, such a relatively, relatively 
[00:56:00]  very short period of time that we've been keeping accurate temperature weather.  I want to know what the weather stats were for the year three.  Really?  Give me, give me the year three.  Give me the year three.  I bet there were 20 years in a row that were hot.  You know what he's like?  You know who he is?  He's the guy going right before the Titanic leaves.  Not even God could sink her.  Exactly.  Shut off, matey!  Now he's got me killing the people on a ship.  Nonchalant arrogance.  Could you at least make me the cigarette guy that sits there and goes, you know, the medical 
[00:56:30]  community is really chastising us and why do they want you to stop smoking?  It's all about politics.  No, I'm saying smoking relaxes you.  How did they explain then that in the beginning of the industrial age, when every state in  this fine union and a lot of countries in Europe were just pumping out coal, everything  ran on coal.  We had more pollution over this country, especially, back in the 20s and 30s than we do right now. 
[00:57:00]  I think, I'm actually trying to remember, because they do address that, but one of the things  they do, you can drill into glacier ice much in the same way that you would drill into a  redwood tree to track chemicals in history to see how old the thing is.  And they can check the amount of CO2 levels that were in the atmosphere a hundred years  ago.  Right.  Checking this little core sample. 
[00:57:30]  Exactly.  And they can look and see, look, it was rising at this incremental level over this period of  five years, to this period of five years, to this period of five years.  All of a sudden, you hit the last century and it rises drastically.  Yeah.  And it's a direct result of human intervention.  And scientists aren't refuting this.  I'll agree with that also.  You'd have to be stupid to think that all of a sudden, this new thing we're doing, burning  fossil fuel, coal, powering things, nuclear energy, whatever it is, is going to somehow  affect the environment.  I'm saying, how bad is it really that we changed? 
[00:58:00]  I think the fact that New Orleans was underwater last year.  That was a big hurricane that hit New Orleans.  New Orleans, don't blame it on everything we're doing.  It could have just been a big hurricane that hit New Orleans.  Ocean temperatures rise.  And you've talked about this before.  The water's too cold up here for there to be a hurricane.  But the water is warming up in southern parts of the southern hemisphere.  For a few years.  And then all of a sudden, it'll cool down.  It's called an ice age. 
[00:58:30]  The water's in steel, matey.  Damn the torpedoes.  More of these violent storms because the ocean's getting warmer.  Life on this planet.  My point is, life on this planet has constantly changed the planet.  Before we were even here, it changed it.  I understand that.  And it will continue to do that.  Because we are the smartest thing so far that we know of that has been on this planet.  Allegedly.  Allegedly, of course. 
[00:59:00]  Things are changing.  Yeah.  We're very – we can adapt.  The planet itself – I love when people say, we've got to save Earth.  Believe me, this planet will be here for a long time after even we're gone.  What is – what's the cardlin line?  The planet will just shake us off like a case of bad fleas?  Yeah.  It's like a wet dog.  Just get off.  And then something else comes here.  All the buildings we see out this lovely window.  Gone.  Some Planet of the Apes scenario where it's just piles of vine-covered dirt after a while. 
[00:59:30]  That's fine by me.  It's just the way things work.  Oh, see.  Now I get it.  He doesn't care.  No.  He doesn't.  Fine.  Okay.  I don't care because –  That's what I was saying earlier.  Because there's nothing to care about.  First, I actually thought he was saying it's not happening.  But now I realize he's saying –  Get out of here.  He just doesn't care.  And by the way, what's your point –  He just doesn't care.  What's your position here, people?  Are we running out of oil or are we going to use it until we burn up the ozone layer?  What's going to happen first?  If we run out of oil, hey, problem solved. 
[01:00:00]  Problem solved.  There's no more fossil fuel being burnt.  We can't screw up the atmosphere.  Everything goes back to normal.  If we don't run out of oil, hey, great.  We don't want to run out of oil.  But so many things are dependent on fossil fuels for their production.  But if we're going to run out –  Yeah.  And then what happens to the environment?  It goes back to being cool again?  I think by the time the oil –  One problem or the other.  What's the big issue?  What's the biggest issue?  Running out of fossil fuel or the fossil fuel affecting the environment?  He's saying both are a big problem, but only one can last long enough to affect us. 
[01:00:30]  Whatever is least financially destructive to the companies that are actually –  Drill Alaska dry.  That's what I say.  Horrific.  You ever been there?  Hey, hey, hey.  Have I ever been there?  I am a road hat, sir.  I have been there.  You've played the Gnome Ha-Ha's?  I have, like, choo-choo Charlie.  The Shuckle Hut in Anchorage?  Yeah.  Just dial 1-800-555-BRRRR.  Well, this is going to get interesting because the director of Al Gore's movie is calling the show later today. 
[01:01:00]  Bring him.  Davis Guggenheim.  Bring him, Guggenheim.  Been to the museum.  I didn't see one dinosaur bone.  This is what I'm saying.  By the way, Steve –  He won't even be open to this guy.  He's already like, I got my truck, Lottie.  I have a big –  I can put it in four-wheel drive.  You can't get a bigger SUV than I have.  I love it.  And you know who I drive in it?  Me.  Me, me, me.  In the summer blockbuster disaster movie, he's that guy who creates the monster and then it turns on him like, I made you. 
[01:01:30]  I made you.  Exactly.  By the way, Steve drives a hybrid as you drive your –  Yes, he does.  Yes.  I certainly do.  And I'm going to buy another one.  Let me ask you something about those because I think those things are BS.  Is it true that they only don't run on gas or oil when you're not moving?  No, not true.  That isn't true.  At slower speeds, you can go completely electric.  Really?  How low –  It's electric.  How fast can you go?  Like city driving, like in the Toyota I have, you can go like 20 miles an hour and you don't have – you're not using any gas. 
[01:02:00]  I mean it's when you hit the highway that you basically – you get up to speed and then you're using your electric motor to coast.  Those things are such a scam.  Here's some audio of Steve driving in his hybrid.  Put her down.  Put her down, Steve.  And look, now it turned into a suitcase and he carries it into his house.  I back you, Steve.  Uh-oh. 
[01:02:30]  I think you're on the right road.  We got a physicist on the line, Jerome from Boston.  Thank you, Jerome.  Jerome, let's go.  What's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  This is a physicist?  What's up?  100%.  Thank you, sir.  Yes.  Wait, are you the guy that is a physicist but it's from like a community college?  Exactly.  Did you hear him?  He's not even –  No, I'm not even kidding.  There's a physicist that calls us but he got his degree from a community college.  Sir, can we have your credentials?  It's not a community college.  What was it?  Who knows?  It's Curry and Milton.  Yeah.  You've called the show before, right?  Yes. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, this is –  I love this guy.  Curry College in Milton, that's right down the street from me.  That's from people who don't study in high school.  Oh, and what college did you go to, Billy Burr?  I'm not saying I'm a physicist.  All right, enough.  I'm not a physicist.  I went to Emerson College.  Wait.  Better school than Curry.  This guy is not –  It is?  This guy is supporting you, Anthony.  I don't know.  I didn't graduate high school.  I know.  He got his degree going to the 13th grade.  13th grade degree?  I don't care.  He's a physicist.  13th grade, he gets a physicist degree there.  He's a physicist, and he agrees. 
[01:03:30]  This guy, I'm a brain surgeon.  Brain surgeon, you're on line one.  What's up, guys?  Steve's just mad because he does 40 on the on-ramp to the expressway and gets passed by everything.  No, I don't.  And his foot is to the floor.  I do not.  My hybrid is –  I can't.  I can't get on the expressway.  Here's him in the morning when the sun isn't up, charging his solar panels.  Oh, come on. 
[01:04:00]  Honey, do you have any vinegar I can put in the gas tank?  I think that works.  If I could get solar panels put on my house, I would, but I just –  Solar panels?  It's great.  If you read about this stuff, you get all your power from the sun, obviously, but it goes back into the grid.  I got solar panels.  You sell it back to the power company.  You sell it back to the power company.  Yep.  Steve, you're totally making sense to me.  Thank you, Billy.  100%.  Of course he is.  Is it true you're building a windmill above your condo? 
[01:04:30]  Oh, I would love it.  I got a windmill, man.  I love you save the world schmucks.  I can't get enough of you save the world idiots.  Look, I'm a –  As opposed to what?  You morons in your SUVs with your guns?  Hey, we know what's right.  Where did guns come in?  You have guns.  You have guns.  When the floods come, I'm going to need them.  You have guns.  I'm going to have to shoot people that are rushing for my dry land.  So what was your point?  Where did the guns come from?  You're home, you jackass.  Exactly.  What do guns have to do with this conversation? 
[01:05:00]  Where did guns come into this?  He actually gets around.  Don't you make me bring guns into this conversation, my friend, because you're going to lose.  You'll be at the losing end of that argument.  We're talking about pollution.  He's got to bring my guns.  I'm going to tell you right now why our side will lose is because this side.  Mike makes right maniacs like him.  We are armed.  We are armed.  He, I swear to God, is two days without food from just taking the AK to his neighbors.  AK.  It's an AR-15, my friend.  American-made weapons.  I don't go for that commie crap. 
[01:05:30]  Steve, you done or what?  Guns!  All right.  Steve's done.  We're going to take a break.  Thank you, Steve.  Once again, let's not forget the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006, coming soon to a venue near you.  We're playing Worcester, the PNC Bank Art Center in Jersey, and September 9th, the Tweeter Center across the river in Philly there in Camden, New Jersey.  Tickets go on sale this morning at 9 a.m. through all Ticketmaster locations. 
[01:06:00]  Check out the lineups by going to our MySpace account.  It's by the river?  Oh, jeez, I hope it's still there by the time we do the gig.  Bring your life jackets, people.  Anthony's going to be there dumping antifreeze in it.  See, look, it's doing nothing.  There's plenty of fish.  There's plenty of fish.  I like how Bill went, Steve, you're 100% right.  Yeah, thank you.  Based on nothing, he's given him 100, not even 99%.  Look, I have a microphone, too, sir. 
[01:06:30]  I have a microphone.  Because you just get totally trashed.  You got the sound effects.  You completely get trashed.  Yeah, I know.  Thank you.  Somebody has to come to his defense.  Thank you, Bill.  100%.  At least 99% of him.  He's given me not 1%.  100%.  Not 1% you're giving me.  Because he has on a mash windbreaker with horizontal.  I can't even listen to this guy.  His dirty baseball hat.  Let me tell you about the world.  What did you base this on?  A movie you saw made by scientists?  Scientists. 
[01:07:00]  Let me tell you something, buddy.  I have a PlayStation and an Xbox.  I know about the atmosphere.  I never heard of this Professor Al Gore scientist.  He's the fucking...  Oops.  Yeah!  He's potty mouth.  He's the spokesperson.  Yeah, he's just a spokesperson giving a lecture.  He's just presenting scientific evidence.  He'll be a scientist coming here.  Spokesperson.  He's what I call a jokes person.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, listen.  We got it, bro.  At least I can carry on a mature conversation without cursing. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, really?  Captain XM?  Potty mouth?  Been fired 18 times?  Before 9 o'clock.  All right, the director will be calling in later today, Davis Guggenheim.  That's going to be a very interesting phone call.  The director of Al Gore's environmental...  Bring him.  Hey, this is JBL, John Bradshaw-Lafel from the WWE.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:08:00]  I know.  We got Davis Guggenheim.  Yes, Davis Guggenheim is on the phone.  Hello, sir.  Davis.  Hello, good morning.  The executive producer of the new movie...  No, no, what is...  Are you the executive producer with the Al Gore movie?  Director.  Director, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I went down one line too many.  I'm sorry.  I'm very jealous that you're married to Elizabeth Shue.  Really?  Yeah, she's great, man.  You can try it for a day and then tell me what you think. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, wow.  Hey, I like that.  Yes.  Wow.  She's actually nine months pregnant.  She's due any day now.  Oh, wow.  Why would you...  We've been together 16 years.  Why would you bring another child into a world that you seem to think is doomed within a week or two?  Good point.  You know, it's pretty terrifying, the global warming thing, but if you see the movie, you see that there's a... it's pretty hopeful if we all sort of start working on it now.  If we start working on it now. 
[01:09:00]  Right.  Now, that means cutting down on our use of fossil fuels?  Yeah, I mean, it's not just one thing.  It's a bunch of things.  It's a bunch of things?  Because I had a point...  Steve C., who works here with us, is a huge fan of the movie.  He drives a hybrid vehicle.  He's a tree hugger.  He's gay.  No, he is not.  But there would be nothing wrong with that if he was.  Cuddly bear that he is.  And it seems to be one thing that we're running out of oil. 
[01:09:30]  An SUV and collects guns.  We're running out of oil, right?  Yep.  And the oil's bad and is ruining our environment and will lead to a cataclysmic end of everything  as we know it.  But...  And the oil comes from a very dangerous place, and we've got to send soldiers there.  Yeah.  But the thing is, if we're run out of oil, doesn't that solve the problem?  Either we're running out of oil... 
[01:10:00]  I could see now if there was so much oil that, oh my God, for thousands of years we're going  to be using this stuff and change the planet.  But if we're running out, then we'll have to come up with something different and problem  solved.  Well, you know, the problem is it's a multifaceted problem.  And I'm not an expert on this.  I'm a filmmaker.  But it's also coal.  You know?  Yeah.  These coal-fired plants are some of the dirtiest polluters.  Weren't we using a lot more coal back in, like, the 20s and 30s? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  And I think the bigger problem is, yes, you know, we're burning too much oil.  We're also burning too much coal.  But basically, we're just consuming any way we like.  Isn't that kind of our job, though, as inhabitants, top of the food chain on the planet?  Like, doesn't the planet...  I see this planet as, like, ours for as long as it'll have us.  No matter what we do, like, there really isn't anything we can do to stretch our time here  a little longer.  Maybe we can cut it a little shorter. 
[01:11:00]  It's like anybody else, you know?  That's like it was when I was, you know, in college and we'd go, you know, for a keg  party.  And we'd have 40 bucks and we'd buy all donuts and we'd just go the weekend and drink all  weekend.  And by the end, you'd end up with nothing.  And you didn't think about, like, perhaps that maybe you needed some other type of food  for the weekend and you didn't quite take care of the place you were staying.  Yeah.  I was in the same boat as you.  You described exactly that.  But, hey, look where we are now.  Yeah.  I mean, but the thing is... 
[01:11:30]  A better place.  There are really simple things that you can do.  Yeah.  That actually make your life better.  Are they simple or inconvenient?  They're inconvenient.  Oh, see.  That's why the movie's called An Inconvenient Truth.  But it actually, you know, I'm not an environmentalist.  You talk about tree hugger.  I'm just not that kind of guy.  Yeah.  And I went to Gord Gives This Thing Live and I went to see it and it just blew my mind  because how powerful the subject is and how, you know, how I just didn't get it. 
[01:12:00]  I thought I knew a little bit about it.  I didn't get it before.  Davis, I have a question for you because a friend of mine knows a lot about this.  And he was saying something along the lines of, like, there's a lot of alternative energy  methods which are available.  But it just seems that people, for some reason, are always going with the older way.  And it's like, without using the newer sources, it kind of contributes and yet it makes the  whole thing, like, a little bit more difficult.  Yeah.  And look at it this way.  You know, you mentioned that, like, the party we've had with oil is about to end. 
[01:12:30]  It's just all the indicators are there, right?  Yeah.  You know, and this has been, you know, America has really been at the top of this game for  a long time.  And, you know, it's going to end.  And someone, some country is going to come up with the next thing.  And if it's China, you know, they come up with the next fuel source.  They'll just burn humans.  Oh.  That's their big resource. 
[01:13:00]  Baby girls.  But the point is, is that, you know, why don't we focus our energies on figuring out what the  next thing is?  Well, I've heard rumors that...  Clearly, the party's over, you know?  I've heard rumors that there's been, like, vehicles that run on alternative fuel.  And that a lot of times what will happen is that the big companies will, like, try to,  like, get the patents.  But, like, it's kind of hard to, like, release it without that.  You know, there's a lot of theories about that.  And I'm not an expert.  And some of them sound like, you know...  Carbuncle.  You know, gay conspiracy stuff. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  But I do know that, you know, when we had our...  Our film came out, this institute in Washington, which we found out later was funded by Exxon  Mobile, put out these ads.  And the ad said something to the effect of, CO2, they call it pollution, we call it life.  And the point is, is they were just trying to keep the controversy going because they  don't want change, you know?  Yeah, they want to keep making their money.  And there needs to be change.  It's all about the almighty dollar. 
[01:14:00]  But does...  But does there...  And so, no, we're not spending any time or energy towards figuring out what these new  things are.  Do you think if we ran out of oil as a country that we would just start walking around in  loincloths and not be able to figure out another way to do things, an alternative source?  Don't you slowly see that there is sort of this migration towards alternate fuel sources now  with the ethanol and corn-based fuels and all this, that it is happening? 
[01:14:30]  Well, my wife, you know, there's a biodiesel pump near our house.  And she's like, well, there's a biodiesel pump.  How come there's not more cars doing it?  Well, it's like, well, because if you drive 50 miles away, you're running out of gas.  How are you going to fill your car up?  Exactly.  There's not enough of them.  The point is that it's a whole system that is locked in step.  But that'll change when it really needs to.  Right now, we kind of have enough.  But there's got to be more, right?  Well, I mean, that's where we disagree, is that I think, you know, the writing has been 
[01:15:00]  on the wall for a while now, you know?  And if you see the movie, you see that because we're putting so much CO2 in the air, the world  is changing really rapidly in a terrifying pace.  Bottom line, Dave, it's time to move and get it done, right?  Yeah, and, you know, you go to a movie, you go to this movie, you go to our website, and  you learn a lot about it.  And I think you and your listeners would say, oh, okay, this isn't as complicated as I thought.  It's real, it's urgent. 
[01:15:30]  What would you say?  But you've got to get big business on the same page, don't you?  What's that?  You've got to get big business on the same page.  Big business, big business.  G.E.?  You've got the college kids, that's easy.  General Electric has, the head of General Electric a couple months ago said that he thinks that  green is green, which means that they're going to focus their technologies and millions of  dollars on research towards green technology.  Well, yeah.  You know, BP, British Petroleum, is out there advertising how to reduce your carbon. 
[01:16:00]  So, you know, things are changing.  Our companies like ExxonMobil, man, they're just stuck in place, you know?  Yeah.  What do you think the average Joe can do?  The number one thing that the average Joe could do to help?  A John Q. Citizen, what can he do?  Well, you go on our website, right?  Yeah.  And there's a thing called a carbon calculator.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, I know.  It sounds complicated.  I'm scared.  But what you do is you look and you see how the choices you make in your life create carbon, 
[01:16:30]  like the car you drive or the air conditioning you use.  I'd like to take this test.  Yeah.  I bet I score pretty high.  Yeah, but you guys, you know, I mean, you got a pretty cynical attitude about this.  But the point is, is that if you wake up to this and you say, look, this is a real problem and I'm part of it, you know,  then you could say, look, this is a pretty easy way to do it.  I bought a, I used to drive a big Tahoe, a Chevy Tahoe.  But now I've got a Prius. 
[01:17:00]  See, how does that make you feel?  Doesn't that make you feel like perhaps you've emasculated yourself a bit?  It's a fantastic car.  He's married to Elizabeth Shue.  I know.  I only drive cars that chicks like.  I have a Caddy because chicks like it.  What does it cost to fill up your tank?  $2,000.  Almost, right?  Mine is less than $20 and it goes 450 miles.  It's unbelievable.  Wow.  Yeah, but it's a Prius.  It's a new piece of technology and I look at these jackasses.  It's driving SUVs. 
[01:17:30]  Exactly.  Exactly.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  You're talking to Mr. Jackass here.  And two years ago, I was one of those jackasses.  I drive the Cadillac of SUVs.  Right?  What's that?  Two years ago, I was driving a big Tahoe.  So I was one of those jackasses, right?  Yeah.  I'm just saying that there's a, you know, there's a flip and suddenly you go, oh, okay.  This isn't so hard.  I think it's just people who drive big trucks like that.  I think, and I think you'll agree, there's a self-centeredness in it.  They're only concerned about themselves and the way things used to be in the 40s and 
[01:18:00]  like, they're not really concerned with the rest of the environment.  Well, look, I bought a SUV because I have little kids and I didn't want to get in a wreck  with a suburban car.  Okay, see?  There you go, right?  So I had a real reason to do it.  And, you know, and it's fun to drive.  They're fantastic cars.  Yeah.  See what I'm doing?  I'm burning the fuel up quicker.  So we have to find an alternative.  If you, people that drive the Priuses, if everybody did that, there'd be fossil fuel burning for 
[01:18:30]  years and years and years, longer than it should be.  Yeah.  I'm helping.  It was interesting how you were saying that because of where the oil is located, how the  problem is really Islam.  I mean, that was actually a good point you made.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't think he said that.  He did.  You don't want to be in that.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Where is the problem as far as where they're drilling?  Let me ask you guys a question.  Have any of you guys seen the film?  Yes.  Steve C. saw it, who has been talking to you over here.  Yes.  Because the way you're talking about it sounds like it's some sort of tree-hugging environmentalist 
[01:19:00]  No, no, not at all.  Raw, raw thing.  I just think if Al Gore's involved, it must be.  Well, you know, when you – most people have that expectation, but I think when you  go see it, you realize it's actually not one of these finger-pointing Michael Moore  films.  I'm going to go see it.  I'm going to go see it.  Is that a fair assessment?  Yeah, I actually do.  I enjoyed it, and I do think that it's a fair – I don't think it's tree-hugging or  any of that stuff.  It's just – it seems like it would be on the surface just because of the title and 
[01:19:30]  what it's about, but then you get into it and you realize it's a legitimate problem  in Al Gore.  But people actually find it funny, and they find it entertaining, and they come out kind  of charged up.  It's not like the end-of-the-world type movie.  I don't know.  From the trailer, it looked like the quick images of trees and then a nuclear power plant  and gas and stuff.  I'm like, ah!  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's kind of scary.  Oh, no?  No, Steve?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's not like that?  No, it's not.  That's just – that was the previews.  Oh, okay.  That was for the omen. 
[01:20:00]  It's actually – you know –  You're looking at the Rock movie trailer.  Yeah, they're running out of fuel, that big gorilla's climbing a building.  How is that going to help us?  Wrong movie, stupid.  I know the movie.  No, I'm going to check it out.  I'm going to definitely – yeah, I'll check it out.  Yeah, we're going to check out the movie there.  Davis.  Yeah, it is a legitimate problem.  I mean, we've got to do something about it.  So, I mean, I've heard the film is actually really good.  Well, thank you.  I mean, I've just –  What state do we lose first, though, underwater?  Florida?  Florida's got to go first, right?  There are a bunch of them. 
[01:20:30]  In fact, my neighbor – I live in California.  My neighbor in Venice is going underwater.  The southern half of Florida.  The Cape.  And then you've got cities like Beijing.  It's unbelievable.  How about Lake Michigan, like off of Lake Michigan?  There's going to be more storms.  There's going to be more erratic weather.  I mean, I think everyone must feel like the weather is just going crazy.  This sounds good.  The Arctic Ocean could be ice-free by the summer 2050. 
[01:21:00]  That sounds good.  Yeah, vacation.  So, there's – you know, yeah.  The problem is that it's not just things gradually getting warmer.  No.  Davis, you sound defeated.  I mean, let's go inside the interview a little bit.  Are you feeling a little defeated?  Talking to you guys, yeah.  I hear you gulping and getting a little uncomfortable.  He's a director and a fine one.  I personally will be checking out the film. 
[01:21:30]  That's for sure.  Do I sound like a –  I think the point I like, though, is that you're saying it's not like a Michael Moore film and all that,  a tree-hugging type of film.  You guys are taking a different approach.  It appeals to reasonable people.  We showed this film to a group of evangelical ministers.  You know, these guys who are sided with the White House on their energy policy.  And they love the film.  Yeah.  The film plays to, you know, reasonable people, you know. 
[01:22:00]  It's not like a totally we're all going to die.  It's like this is the situation and this is what you can do to fix it.  I can imagine people seeing it and saying, oh, this is one of – you know, putting in a box and saying this is Al Gore and this is a political –  Yeah, do you leave us with a little hope at the end of the film?  I'm like –  Yeah, I mean, the film actually – the end of the film is very uplifting and it leaves you with very simple things you can do.  All right.  Now, I bring canvas bags to the supermarket and I don't use those little plastic ones.  Is that a good thing?  Does that knock down my CO2 consumption? 
[01:22:30]  I lost you.  You're fading out.  He actually brings bags with him, canvas bags to the supermarket.  So when they say paper plastic, he goes, neither.  I already have mine.  And he brings them and, you know, uses them instead of the plastic or paper.  So I'm sure that's just helping out.  That sounds a little gay to me.  Oh, yeah.  What up?  Thank God.  Thank you, Davis.  Now we like you.  Now we like you.  Thank God.  What a creep you must look like marching out those empty bags. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  I look like a bag lady.  I shouldn't have said that.  No, you were completely correct.  I like the honesty.  No, you gave into it.  You became weak.  I was trying to side with you, and you threw me under the bus.  What city?  I'm going to go see the omen this weekend.  I think he's the one voice I can't hear for some reason.  No, Bill is gay.  It's no big deal.  Oh, I know why.  He should be down probably.  Oh, that part.  What city did you say is in deep trouble?  It's sinking and all that?  Beijing?  What city?  Beijing? 
[01:23:30]  Beijing, yeah.  What's the deal with Beijing?  Well, all these low-lying countries, like the Netherlands, right?  Yeah.  They're more affected by sea level rise.  So, you know, if half of Greenland and half of Antarctica melts, sea level rise is predicted  to go up 20 feet.  Yeah, but then, you know, the gondola business will explode.  That's true.  See?  Yeah, I think if you...  Take lemons.  I think it's good logic.  I can't argue with that.  Take lemons.  Gondola business with the guys with the big sticks, and they get to dress nice, too.  Wouldn't we just evolve into something with gills?  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  If too much of the planet becomes water, we just all of a sudden...  Or Waterworld, you know?  I'm sure you would have directed that differently.  Kevin Costner's still alive.  He could tell us what to do.  You guys got a good point.  I can't argue with that.  I can't argue with that.  All the girls would look like Daryl Hannah.  More importantly.  I think after this interview, Davis is going out and getting his Suburban back.  He's like, yeah, go pick up your Escalade or something.  You guys are right.  I love it.  No, Davis is right.  Screw this.  I appreciate it.  Thanks for hanging in there with us. 
[01:24:30]  It's Davis Guggenheim.  Sorry, Guggenheim.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you so much.  You know, I was so hoping that they were going to bring on an actual expert so it could  combat his argument.  He's an expert on directing.  And he's just like, I really don't know what the fuck my movie's about.  I was ready to start asking him about it because he directed a season of Deadwood.  I was going to start asking him about that.  All I wanted to ask him about was Elizabeth Shue's Heine and how good it looked in leaving  Las Vegas.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Holy God.  Was she sexy in that.  It doesn't look that good anymore.  Jesus Christ, dude.  Oh, I'm sure.  Why would you say that?  That guy might be just a guest seconds ago on our program. 
[01:25:00]  And you're insulting his wife.  I think his wife is a fan.  Pregnastic.  Wife.  These guys, they can do whatever they want to do.  This is why people are tuning in to hear Opie and Anthony.  And this is where things get ridiculous.  I need to be a shock jock.  Always up to no good.  Be a man.  I laughed so hard I had to buckle myself out of my couch.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And this is like the number one show in the world. 
[01:25:30]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Are there people out there like Obe's got Steve putting a ringtone on?  Guys like Colin Quinn have no idea how to use their cell phone.  So Bob Kelly will always put weird things on his phone that Colin can't take off.  So if any of you out there have friends or a girlfriend or a wife that does not know how to take things off her phone,  I'm going to get a little ringtone that you might want to put on there.  And she won't know how to take it off. 
[01:26:00]  Okay.  Ring, ding, ding, pick up the phone, cunt.  Ring, ding, ding, pick up the phone, cunt.  Now, just put that on your wife, girlfriend, daughter.  Put that on anybody's phone that doesn't know how to take it off.  Even a guy friend and does not know how to take it off.  Because some people don't know how to use their phone.  They don't know how to just answer it. 
[01:26:30]  How about...  Oh, fuck, it wasn't loud enough.  It smelled like Chinese food from last night.  I would absolutely please somebody put that on someone else's phone.  Let's say hi to Rich in Philly.  Rich, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I want to hear Jimmy's impression of Richard Johnson as a ringtone.  Hold on.  Punching out.  Hold on.  This is a ringtone.  He was swallowing pretzel. 
[01:27:00]  I'm sorry, guys.  I'm a faggot.  I'm a faggot.  That'd be fun to put on a friend's.  Absolutely.  And have him not know how to remove it.  I need the cock.  I need the cock.  These are all to be put on Foundry Music as ringtones.  I hope they know that.  Or how about this?  Jews are inferior.  Jews are inferior. 
[01:27:30]  Jews are inferior.  Oh, my God.  Why not?  Put that on someone's phone who works at the law office.  Yes.  All right.  The most depressing songs of all time, according to this book, I Hate Myself and Want to Die.  They did the top 52.  But we'll cut it down to 50.  We'll do.  Well, number 11 was won by Metallica.  So it just missed the top 10 list.  Aw.  And number 10.  You got the list in there, Derek?  He better.  He's got to play his songs. 
[01:28:00]  If he doesn't have that list, he would have a list of job openings.  Number 10 is not a depressing song.  No?  Fun little ditty.  Then why is it on the list?  It's by the Jim Carole Band.  Oh, because it's People Who Die.  People Who Die.  It's a depressing song.  It's an up-tempo number, but for God's sake, it's pretty depressing. 
[01:28:30]  Little kids.  One more verse.  There you go. 
[01:29:00]  Number 10.  People Who Died by the Jim Carole Band.  Robert Reed was a dad on TV.  Wound up getting the HIV.  Oh, and I heard it.  They went tee-hee.  And I have it, too, said their pal Jimmy.  Huh?  A lot of the songs in the top 10, I don't think I've ever heard in my life.  No?  Marianne Faithful in 9th Place. 
[01:29:30]  A song called Sister Morphine.  Does anyone think I've heard it?  Shut up, Jimmy.  I know Marianne Faithful.  I think I've heard that one, though.  No, you don't.  I do.  I don't.  Sister Morphine.  Brother Aspirin.  I don't think Brother Aspirin makes an appearance in this song.  Uncle Cottonball.  Ant Needle.  Let's go to Jason in Oklahoma City.  Jason?  Hey, I was wondering if I could get a ringtone from Jimmy there.  All right.  All right.  Which one?  Get a wah-wah penis.  Oh, yeah.  You got to do wah-wah penis. 
[01:30:00]  A lot of people like wah-wah penis.  Wah-wah penis.  Wah-wah.  Wait, yeah.  Let me do it.  Thanks, Hawk.  Good call.  Doing the tube.  Wah-wah penis.  Wah-wah penis.  Good ringtone, man.  Exactly.  Good ringtone.  Nick in Texas.  Nick?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen.  Whoever made this stupid list, a song has to sound depressing to be depressing. 
[01:30:30]  That's what I'm saying.  That's...  Nobody can just...  Go ahead.  That was ridiculous.  Yeah, that's up-tempo.  I like that one.  Yeah, that was too...  You don't get...  Even if the words say die, die, die, or commit suicide, commit suicide, if it sounds happy,  it's happy.  It's kind of like you playing the Benny Hill music behind something, you know?  I completely agree with you.  Still depressing, the words.  Not at all.  Come on, little kids with leukemia and...  You just get into it.  Looked 65 when he died.  Let's sing along to it.  That's a toe-tapper.  Sister Morphine.  What's this about? 
[01:31:00]  We have a little taste?  No?  No?  All right, good.  Sister Morphine.  Oh, the time has come.  No?  That's not it?  Number eight.  Sister Morphine.  Brother John.  No, I don't think that's it either.  I hate that fucking song.  Wait, it's...  It's...  Someone's knocking at the door, huh?  Yeah.  Ugh.  Somebody's ringing the bell.  Do me a favor.  Open the door.  And let him in.  That's the name of the song. 
[01:31:30]  Let him in.  Hopefully it's not a shoe salesman.  All right.  Number eight.  It's Nine Inch Nails and Hurt.  Yeah.  Cash's is better.  Cash's is way better.  I know the original...  More depressing.  I know the original is done by Nine Inch Nails, but...  Can we get a taste of Johnny Cash doing Hurt?  This song is deeply depressing.  I hurt myself...  Here he goes.  Hello.  I'm Johnny Cash. 
[01:32:00]  I should have had Joaquin Phoenix sing this.  I hurt myself today!  I hurt myself today...  Did ya?  To see if I still feel...  Well, do ya?  I focus on the pain...  Did ya?  The only thing that's real...  Is it?  The needle tears the hole... 
[01:32:30]  Does it?  The old familiar sting...  Is it?  Try to kill it all away...  Do ya?  But I remember everything...  Do ya?  What have I become...  My sweetest friend...  Everyone I know... 
[01:33:00]  Goes away...  In the end...  Do they?  All right, we get it.  Yeah, could I?  That's a great song, though, man.  Fantastic.  Hey, let's say hi to Rick.  Another Canadian checking in.  Lucky us today.  Hey, Rick, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey. 
[01:33:30]  I'm telling you, we fucking love you guys up here.  Thank you.  We haven't gotten a lot of email from Kennedy yet.  Rick, what's up with that?  Go.  Uh, uh, we don't have computers up here.  It's cold.  It's cold.  They freeze up the keys, eh?  Hey.  Anyways, I don't...  You guys don't know who Jim Carroll is?  You gotta know who Jim Carroll is.  Of course we know who Jim Carroll is.  Okay, good.  Basketball Diaries, my friend.  You've never heard the song before.  I've heard the song many times.  I think we all heard the song.  Isn't it supposed to be autobiographical for him? 
[01:34:00]  Like, didn't he write the Basketball Diaries, that movie with that, uh, Saget DiCaprio?  What?  Saget.  Wow.  Uh-oh.  Phew.  Uh, System Morphine is a Stones song that was co-written by Marianne Faithful.  The Stones version is on Sticky Fingers.  Is that true?  Yeah, we got the, we got it now.  All right, thank you, Rick.  What happened?  Oh, Iraq.  Oh, Iraq.  You're telling the boss he's wrong, Iraq?  All right, hit it.  He's right, you're wrong.  Um, I hurt myself. 
[01:34:30]  I ain't, yeah.  She was great in a Metallica song.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I'm alive in my hospital bed.  Uh.  Tell me, Sister Morphine, when are you coming round again? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, I don't think I could wait that long.  Yeah, turn on, can you have Mick Jagger show her how it's done?  God, she has the worst voice ever.  I like her.  You didn't like her in the Metallica song?  What was the one she was, ba-da-da-da-da?  What was that fucking song?  Hated it.  Where she chimed in and ruined the song? 
[01:35:30]  I was at, when Brewer was on SNL and I got to watch Metallica rehearse Fuel and that  song, it was like 15 of us in a room on the SNL soundstage and Metallica came in and was  rehearsing.  It was, they had to time it out.  They were doing the same song like eight times just to get the timing right.  And then Marianne Faithful come in and was helping them, you know, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, whatever song it was, Fuel was one and the other one, The Memory Remains.  The Memory Remains.  I hate it.  She ruins it.  Hadfield was annoyed at her.  He didn't want to stand the next door.  Horace, get away. 
[01:36:00]  Mick used to bang her, by the way.  Go for him.  Mickey Rivers, I mean.  Not much better.  Is it?  I said not much better.  No.  Oh, okay.  Well, now you're coming round again. 
[01:36:30]  All right, enough.  I like her version better, actually.  I don't like either version.  Not quite sympathy for the devil, is it?  No.  Sister Morphine.  Here's your ringtone.  That's called pretzel bag.  That's such a great business right there.  They will be downloaded like crazy.  Wait, wait. 
[01:37:00]  One more.  Uh-oh, look.  Mother's calling.  Oh, God.  Number seven.  Most depressing songs of all time, according to this dumb book, I hate myself and want to die.  I love you.  Billie Holiday.  Billie Holiday.  Strange Fruit.  Who's he?  I understand.  Strange Fruit.  Oh, boy.  Someone help us out with what these songs are about, by the way.  Help us on the instant feedback. 
[01:37:30]  I think we know what this song's about.  Never heard the, uh, saying strange fruit?  Something that grows on trees.  It's not supposed to be there.  It's strange.  Maybe that fruit was seen with a white woman.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  Long enough intro, huh?  Don't stop treating me like a whore.  Yeah?  You like Huey Lewis and the News?  How long does this intro go on?  Come on.  Get to the strange fruit part.  Is this an instrumental?  Do we even know?  Oh, is it? 
[01:38:30]  I don't know.  Probably.  Southern Tree.  There.  There she goes.  There a strange fruit.  He's a fag.  It's a girl.  And blood at the room.  No, the fruit, you idiot.  That she's looking at.  Black bodies swinging.  In the southern breeze.  Jesus.  There's a strange fruit hanging from the poplar tree.  This is a little depressing. 
[01:39:00]  It's good, though.  Who wrote this?  Oh, yeah.  There's a natural scene of the gallant sound.  The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth.  The scent of magnolia, sweet and fresh. 
[01:39:30]  Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.  Was this a hit?  Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck, for the rain together, for the wind to suck, for the sun to wrap, for the tree to drop. 
[01:40:00]  For the tree to drop, for the tree to drop, here is a strange and bitter crop.  Now they all get back at us with that strange fruit in their pants. 
[01:40:30]  The giant plantain.  That's a good tune, though, man.  I'm going to have to go to iTunes and get that.  Put that on your iPod.  Yeah, I listen to that.  I listen to Minnie Ripperton singing, uh...  Loving You.  Yeah, but the fucking bird sharps wrecked that song.  It's the worst sound of...  What did you do that with a Casio?  Fucking 75?  Loving you.  Charp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.  Charp, chirp.  Flutter, flutter. 
[01:41:00]  Charp, chirp.  Chippy.  Another ringtone.  Of course.  Here's Captain Obvious.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, that's, uh...  It's about a winching, isn't it?  Really?  Wow.  It's not, actually.  It's about...  They planted seeds for one fruit and another fruit grew and it's just depressing in the south.  It's very strange.  Okay.  Did he really think he was enlightening us on that one?  He did.  Yeah, let's go to Jim in Florida.  Jim?  Because black bodies swinging from the trees wasn't exactly a tip-off as to what it was about.  Hey, guys, we need a collage of Steve's ringtones, you know, a grrr in the hybrid car, all that. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, put those on foundry.  Yeah, we'll get a bunch of ringtones up on opiananthony.com.  That'd be great, dude.  Love you guys.  Thank you.  All right, so that song, yeah, that's definitely depressing.  More depressing than the Jim Carroll band, People Who Died.  Number six, most depressing songs of all time, Blood Rock.  I've never even heard of this band.  It's E-Rock when he's on his period. 
[01:42:00]  We all are getting going.  Wow, yeah.  The wheels just started turning and Jimmy's already in first gear.  Jimmy is quick.  He's ripping down the strip.  Blood Rock.  Oh, why did you make a face before?  Because his breath is awful.  Oh, no.  I was trying to be cool, but...  Oh, stop.  No.  I almost passed out.  Well, he leaned over because he was looking for something.  I was like, you've got to be kidding me.  Don't tell him when he gets back, though.  All right.  Trying to be cool. 
[01:42:30]  Keep it under your hat.  Johnny from...  No, Snap Man from Whack Bag.  People Who Died is about people lucky enough not to hear Brett's call.  Loving you.  All right.  Here we go.  So, Blood Rock.  Chirp, chirp.  Sixth place.  A song called D.O.A.  Oh, sounds creepy. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, I've heard of this song.  Yeah?  This is like a...  This is one of those songs the rock stations like to play every Halloween.  Oh, really?  Dead Body.  Like Monster Mash?  Dead Body.  It's Monster Mash.  I played this song a million times when I was doing the Rock Chalk thing.  Yeah.  Monster Mash.  Thanks. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, what an awful song.  It was a graveyard.  The Monster Mash.  All right.  All right.  It was all in a flash.  Was it?  Really?  His uncle fucked him in the ass.  The Monster Mash.  The Monster Rain.  Oh, it's the bubbling of the laboratory.  And my uncle took me down for some Monster Rain.  The Monster Rain.  Oh.  His butt was in pain. 
[01:44:00]  His butt was in pain.  I was working in the lab late one night.  Were you?  In my eyes bewildered an eerie sight.  Did they?  The Monster from the slab began to rise.  Did he?  And suddenly, to my surprise.  He did the mash.  Did he?  He did the Monster Mash.  The Monster Mash.  It was a graveyard smash.  He did the mash.  Oh.  Huge hit.  He did the mash.  I don't know who I want dead more.  Him or the background people?  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[01:44:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Somebody actually, these women actually for years are probably going to tell people,  you ever hear Monster Mash?  Yeah.  I'm backup singer.  I'm backup singer four.  They did the mash.  That's me.  You can hear me more than the other ones.  I like this version of Monster Mash.  Yes.  Here I am, out for its throw, minding my own vampire business.  Hey, what's that noise under the porch?  I better investigate.  Oh, my goodness.  Stop that.  I am scarred for life. 
[01:45:00]  I don't remember that.  I was walking one fine day when I first saw two young eager boys hidden under the porch.  One was little Jimmy Norton with eyes so round.  He was on his friend's crotch making slurping sounds.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  The monster rain.  And now his clothes are all stained.  He did the rain.  It caused him mental pain. 
[01:45:30]  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  With his little buggy eyes and soft little breasts,  young Jimmy saw that he was making amends.  His hair was all sticky, but he kept his pace.  Now we know why he likes hookers to piss on his face.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  The monster rain.  And little Jimmy was game.  He did the rain.  It caused him mental pain.  He did the rain. 
[01:46:00]  He did the monster rain.  The two boys were just having fun.  The monster rain had just begun.  The other boy's father caught them and he said,  Hey there.  What are you doing to my son?  Hey, young Jimmy.  Let me tassel your hair.  Why are you so sticky and covered in sweat?  Your spit-stayed cheeks are so very bad.  When I just invented a game called The First Night in Jail, 
[01:46:30]  he did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  The monster rain.  That's an ass.  Little Jimmy was game.  He did the rain.  And now his clothes are all stained.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  Now that Jimmy's a little older,  he must repent  that he has such memories of rubber cement.  He should have protested  and stated quite plain.  Dude, I'm not going to taste your DNA.  Oh no, you hear that? 
[01:47:00]  They read it again.  Man, that's disturbing.  I'm going to have to have my eyes washed.  Why would anybody even tell this story?  Little Jimmy Norton's a sociopath.  Very funny.  Hey, a couple of instant feedbacks coming in.  Rob from DC,  please isolate Jimmy singing along with Hurt.  Funniest shit ever.  Yeah, we should make a little promo  or something out of that.  Oh, you got it?  All right.  And then you got this asshole Surge Master  from Whack Bag.  Of course.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Your show sucks and isn't funny  because you assholes are sleepy. 
[01:47:30]  Today, it's the worst.  The worst?  We've had much worse shows.  We've had horrific shows, sir.  I think today has been a very enjoyable show.  Maybe we'll rebroadcast them  and remind you.  That's right, Surge Master.  All right, Surge Master.  You douchebag.  So getting back to the most depressing songs of all time.  You know what's a good song by Johnny Cash, by the way?  Life Goes On.  No.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  I'm trying to point out a song. 
[01:48:00]  Right away, you're getting fucking fresh.  He's just kidding, little fucking manners.  All right, here's number six.  So it's Blood Rock.  They play it every Halloween on a lot of rock stations.  It's DOA and it's a guy.  He's dead, but he's singing.  Oh, is that it?  From his perspective, yes.  When does that happen?  It doesn't.  I think it's a really long song, too, right?  Look at a rock block.  Yeah.  It's long.  Yeah.  It's short.  We won't make it that far. 
[01:48:30]  Sounds like it's long.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Laying here, looking at the ceiling.  Someone lays a sheet across my chest.  Oh, he's in a hotel.  No?  Something warm is flowing down my fingers.  Maybe he's singing Dominatrix.  Pain is flowing all through my back. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, F-O-A, man.  This is horrible.  I'll get him.  I tried to move my arm and there's no feeling.  And when I look, I see there's nothing there.  Jesus Christ.  The face beside me stopped you totally bleeding.  The girl I knew had such a distant stare. 
[01:49:30]  I remember we were flying along and hit something in the air.  I remember we were flying along and hit something in the air. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, plane crash.  So creepy.  So creepy.  Then I look straight at the attendant  His face is pale as it can be  He bends and whispers something softly 
[01:50:30]  He says there's no chance for me  How is this more depressing than strange fruit?  This asshole in a sesta?  It's a John Denver story.  I was eating great nuts.  I hit the water.  We know.  We know.  We're sure you did. 
[01:51:00]  I was in first class having a Sunday.  The rest of the filthy ONA crew  Was in the back where they belong  Let's go to Eric in Kansas City.  Eric.  Oh, so why would someone's been calling me?  Hey.  The most depressing song I've ever heard  Is Estrella by Brave Saint Saturn.  Hi.  What's it about?  It's about a kid who...  Oh, can I call you back?  I'm on the radio.  Who is it, Jimmy? 
[01:51:30]  It's Laura Armstrong.  Who is she?  I'll call you back in a few.  Stretches a...  Who is she?  No.  I have a meeting with her after.  Funny.  Full of gelatin and you can pull her arms real far.  Oh, shit.  Hello?  Yeah.  Oh, you're on the phone too, right?  Guard ahead, sweet angel.  Sorry.  You got to play a song called Estrella  by a band called Brave Saint Saturn.  We'll get right to it.  Who's deaf and going blunt? 
[01:52:00]  I am.  Okay.  What's the song called?  My Driving Test?  Sounds good.  Sounds good.  Fuck em.  All right.  Back to the real list.  Yeah, we're going to take a break  and we'll do the top five  most depressing songs of all time.  Although, who was the guy in a whack bag  that didn't like us?  Surge.  Everybody.  Surge.  Surge.  Douchebag.  Sorry, cuntface.  You're not enjoying the show.  Turn it off.  Why don't you just stop listening?  That's all you have to do.  Just fucking stop listening. 
[01:52:30]  Hey everybody, this is Travis Tritt  and you're listening to the worst,  and I do mean the worst,  of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Ooh, who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, top five.  What, Opie?  Most depressing songs of all time.  Yeah.  We finally hit good old Terry Jacks.  Terry Jacks? 
[01:53:00]  The one-hit wonder  of Seasons in the Sun.  Oh, we had joy.  We had fun.  We had Seasons in the Sun.  What's sad about that?  You had some fucking fun at the beach.  A little fun.  What's wrong with it?  Where does it go wrong?  I don't know.  Goodbye, my friend.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, maybe it starts bad.  Goodbye to you, my trusted friend.  We've known each other since we were nine or ten. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  I want you to hit him over the head  with that old Leslie keyboard.  Learned of love on ABC.  Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees.  Goodbye, my friend.  It's hard to die.  Then we killed all of the monsters.  When all the birds are singing.  We have a sign.  God, I'm a hinder.  The girls are everywhere. 
[01:54:00]  Think of me and I'll be there.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  We had joy.  We had fun.  We had Seasons in the Sun.  But the hills that we climbed  were just seasons out of time.  Goodbye, Papa.  Please pray for me.  Oh, no.  An early death.  I was the black sheep of the family.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  You tried to teach me right from wrong. 
[01:54:30]  You disciplined me with your veiny dong.  I wonder how I got on.  It's over, Jenny.  It's over, Jenny.  You can act like a man.  Look at all.  The birds are singing in the sky.  Now that the spring's in the air.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Little children everywhere.  We're changed for nothing.  When you see them, I'll be there.  We had joy. 
[01:55:00]  We had fun.  We had seasons in the Sun.  We had it all.  But the wine and the song, like the seasons have all gone.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  We had fists in our bums.  But the wine and the song, like the seasons have all gone.  Oh, my, my, my, my.  I'm Michelle, my little one.  Oh, the little one saying goodbye.  You gave me love and helped me find a son. 
[01:55:30]  Did your parents have any children to live?  Sir, yes, sir.  I bet they regret that.  You would always come around and get my feet back on the ground.  Goodbye, Michelle.  It's hard to die.  Just do it.  When all the birds are singing in the sky.  Oh, you little thing.  Did you make me want to vomit?  Put it in the air with the flowers everywhere.  Now lean forward and choke yourself.  I wish that we could both be there. 
[01:56:00]  Your day is a finger-legged old Mary Gaines, but he's not through her pretty pink pennies are over.  Not going to be sound right.  Pretty fucking time, sweetheart.  You both go on.  You folks go on your face. 
[01:56:30]  That's a hard one.  Why does this keep coming up like this?  You folks go on your face.  No shit.  Did the guy die?  Apparently.  In real life?  I don't...  His career did.  What's that song about?  Can someone get me a bio?  Quick, quick, quick.  He's dying.  He's saying goodbye to everybody.  But is it from someone else's point of view or his?  I don't think it's his.  No, it was Terry Jacks.  He wasn't dying at the time. 
[01:57:00]  But who's Michelle?  He named people, so it's got to be from someone.  Yeah, imaginary family.  Goodbye, Michelle, my little one.  My little one.  Well, that's number five.  Most depressing songs of all time.  Goodbye, Franny, my neighbor.  That's all right.  Who's Lawn Mower?  I never return.  Goodbye, my mailman.  Always there for me.  Goodbye, milkman.  Thanks for the extra cream.  We get it.  You were loved.  That's for tomorrow.  Go fuck yourself.  We'll do that tomorrow.  Make sure you remind me.  Goodbye, grandmama. 
[01:57:30]  And your smelly feet and diapers.  Yes.  Yes, I know Nirvana did a cover of that song.  Yes.  Did they?  Number four, Anthony.  Number four.  Jimmy.  Most depressing songs ever.  Bonnie Tyler.  Total Eclipse of the Heart.  What's wrong with that song?  What?  Turn around.  Bright high.  No, which one is that?  Turn around.  What's wrong with the song?  Every time I...  It's a good song, I think. 
[01:58:00]  Something, something.  Every time I...  La, la, la, la, la, la.  La.  Well, let's see where this goes wrong.  I've heard this song a million times.  I had no idea it was a depressing song.  Suck this cock.  Turn it off.  I can't hear this.  Ooh.  But you're going to start there.  And there.  But not here.  Every now and then I get a little bit lonely. 
[01:58:30]  That's her uncle.  Heartbreak or something?  Every now and then I get a little bit tired.  I'm listening to the sound of my tears.  Turn around.  Every now and then...  You know what it is?  She's really drunk and she's squatting and shitting on the floor and leaning on the toilet with her elbow.  Someone's telling her, hey, turn around.  She's evacuating all over the tiles.  Every now and then I get a little bit tired. 
[01:59:00]  Turn around.  Right on.  Every now and then I get a little bit tired.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  Turn around.  Every now and then I get a little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child.  Turn around.  And then I get a little bit angry and I don't know how to cry.  Turn around. 
[01:59:30]  Every now and then I get a little bit angry and I don't know how to cry.  Every now and then I get a little bit terrified but then I see the look in your eyes.  This lady dies singing to her ex-husband.  Every now and then I get a little bit angry and I don't know how to cry.  Every now and then I fall apart and I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever and if you only hold me tight, we'll be holding on forever and we'll hardly be making it right. 
[02:00:00]  Who are you?  Cause we'll never be wrong.  Together we can take you to the end of the life.  You're lovers like a child.  I want the all of the time.  I want the time.  I don't know what to do.  I want the time.  It's just like heartbreak.  We've had a bunch of death and destruction and this is just like heartbreak.  He never turns around.  Who cares?  He don't turn around.  That's the problem.  Bright eyes never turn around. 
[02:00:30]  Is she saying turn around or is the guy saying turn around?  It's like he's saying-  Who's saying it?  Who cares?  But he's going turn around.  Like maybe I'm right here.  I think that's just a thought.  It goes unanswered.  There's no eye contact.  She's the one that's heartbroken.  Why is she calling them bright eyes?  Who is she?  Sinatra?  Turn around babe.  Turn around you classy dame.  That's not my fucking asshole she is.  That's number four most depressing songs of all time.  It's Bonnie Tyler.  Totally clips of the heart.  I'm going to guess what number three is. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  Happy birthday.  To me.  It's somebody called Bobby Goldsboro.  Oh no.  Which one is this?  Oh I know what it is.  I know this song.  What's the title?  Honey there's a lump on your tit.  What's the title?  It's called Honey.  Honey.  Is it?  It's called Honey.  That was a complete goof.  It's called Honey.  Honey.  Oh.  And it's about him I think.  She dies.  She dies.  Sure it's not about Steve's lunch? 
[02:01:30]  Honey.  Honey.  I forgot how the tune of it goes.  If I knew I would probably know every word.  All right.  Let's take a listen to Bobby Goldsboro.  Honey.  Got it.  Space.  The final frontier.  It goes like Pink Floyd's Money but instead of money they say Honey.  Honey.  See the tree.  How big it's grown my friend.  It hasn't been too long.  It wasn't big.  I remember this song from when I was a little, little, little kid.  I laughed at her and she got mad.  I punched her in her fucking face for laughing at me. 
[02:02:00]  Because it wouldn't get hard.  I've been drinking you castrating pig.  I've been drinking you castrating pig.  She ran out to brush the snow.  You put a few pounds on.  So it wouldn't die.  See I.  She went to.  They planted a tree.  She brushed the snow away so it wouldn't die.  Came running in.  All excited.  All excited.  Slipped and almost hurt herself.  Almost.  Very close.  I laughed till I cried.  And he laughed at her.  I was a little, little, little kid.  I was a little, little kid.  I laughed at her and she got mad.  I punched her in her fucking face for laughing at me.  Because it wouldn't get hard.  Because it wouldn't get hard.  I've been drinking you castrating pig.  She ran out to brush the snow came.  You put a few pounds on. 
[02:02:30]  Very close.  And I laughed till I cried.  And he laughed at her almost slipping.  That's funny.  She pulled a muscle in her back.  She was always young at heart.  Kinda dumb and kinda smart.  She was an easy lay.  Jesus.  She's a clumsy retard.  Retard.  She'd shit her pants and wave her medals.  Wear a Pete Rose hairdo and spoil the family pictures.  Jesus.  What else did this enchantress do?  It would sure embarrass her when I came into work and meet.  Fucking useless cunt brushing snow off tree roots. 
[02:03:00]  And she'd have peanut butter on herself and the dog was there.  He'd lick her pussy and fuck her throat.  We'd laugh and make eye contact.  Here it is.  Honey, I miss you.  Haven't gotten to the part where she dies yet, though.  Oh, he's singing this to the tree.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'd love to be with you.  Then kill yourself. 
[02:03:30]  If only I could.  All right.  I think the death scene's coming.  Uh-oh.  Hold on to your hats.  How'd she die?  She wrecked the car and she was sad.  And so afraid that I'd be mad.  And I was.  My insurance premiums went up and I had a kicker in the uterus.  In the uterus.  It was a Saturn and I couldn't cruise trannies for a while.  She was pinned against the tree causing a ruckus.  Oh, it came home unexpectedly. 
[02:04:00]  And caught her crying needlessly.  In the middle of the day.  She's a fucking psychopath retard clumsy bitch.  There was a stewed tomato on the floor.  I have to repaint that room again.  She went away.  And honey, I miss you.  She's kind of crying.  And then she drops dead.  She had something, I guess.  And I'm being good.  I'd love to be with you, but I'm busy repainting the nursery. 
[02:04:30]  We'll make it an office like we originally planned.  We made the nursery an office and the chick that I was really looking at moved in last night.  I know you've only been gone three days, but what the heck, I gotta get over it sometime.  When I was growing up, that song was like on the radio when I was a real little kid.  And it was on all the time.  And then me and my brother used to make fun of it when we got a little older.  Sort of like we were just making fun of it, make up the wrong words. 
[02:05:00]  I've been doing that shit since I was like four years old.  What, the lyrics?  I have just awful words to songs.  So she crashed a car because she had something wrong with her.  She was home crying and then dropped dead.  Yeah, she was home crying.  Apparently she had something.  And they never get into it.  Hopefully it was the old hymn.  Alright, the runner-up.  Most depressing songs of all time.  According to this book, I hate myself and want to die.  She wore a robe and drank some broth.  Alice the maid and Sam came home, but wait, she's not a man. 
[02:05:30]  We have Harry Chapin.  Harry Chapin.  Oh my god, Cats in the Cradle.  No.  If it's Taxi over Cats in the Cradle?  No.  Oh, 30,000 pounds of bananas?  I've never heard of this song either.  A tractor trailer on the LIE?  Dreams Go By?  Is it Oopsie Daisy Bumper?  Don't tell me it's W-O-L-D or fucking Dreams Go By.  How do you know all these Harry Chapin songs? 
[02:06:00]  I love Harry Chapin.  He was amazing.  I know what it is.  It's fucking...  Wait.  It's not Mr. Tanner.  It's about upstate New York.  It's about the fucking...  I am the Midnight Watchmen.  Down at Miller's Tool and Die.  That's probably the one.  What's so sad about that?  He's got a shitty job, but at least he's working.  He has a one night stand.  He's a very lonely...  A better place to be.  It's called The Aids.  It's a song called The Shortest Story.  Never heard it. 
[02:06:30]  How old is the oldest song on the list?  Are there new ones?  Not really.  Because there's one...  Don't tell me if it's on it or not, but The Christmas Shoes.  Have you heard of that one?  The Mabel King song?  Way to fucking wreck the whole bit.  I didn't say it.  Give me a clue whether it's...  Way to wreck the whole bit.  I didn't say.  Opie, what did I say?  I said, don't say if it's on the list or not.  I couldn't help myself.  Look.  See?  Now look what you did.  Bill Burr's not here, so you decided to do the bit record. 
[02:07:00]  I didn't ruin the bit.  You ruined it by not reacting.  I want to hear the shorter story.  I never heard that Harry Chapin.  All right, let's do Harry Chapin and then of course the number one most depressing...  Oh, I ruined the bit.  I love it.  It doesn't matter.  Good.  That's right.  Take out your tissues, you melodramatic jizz buckets at home.  Get ready to dab your eyes.  Ryan faggot.  That's right.  Boo fucking hoo.  Let's play the shortest story.  Harry Chapin.  Shortest story.  Is that Voss's fingers? 
[02:07:30]  Big A's cock.  I am born today.  The sun burns a promise in my eyes.  Mama strikes me and I drop a breath and cry.  Above me a cloud softly tumbles.  Is this a real time story of his life or something? 
[02:08:00]  There's less than two minutes left.  To be alive.  Oh, I hope there's a fucking small toy involved that shouldn't be eaten.  It is my seventh day.  Oh no.  I taste the hunger.  The blind string.  The string to the blinds that you're supposed to snip at the bottom.  That yummy paint chip.  That thing to mama's side. 
[02:08:30]  She squeezes her breast.  But it has nothing to provide.  It shoots a fart like a whoopee cushion in the kid's face.  What's wrong with mommy?  Is she poor?  Maybe it was daddy and he's fat.  Maybe the kid wanted to win and he's a little hungry.  It's 20 days.  I'm fighting up in RCS.  20 days.  Mama does not hold me.  Anymore. 
[02:09:00]  Anymore.  I open my mouth.  But I am too weak to cry.  Up on me a bird.  It slowly crawls across the sky.  Why?  Why is there nothing now to do but die?  Whoa. 
[02:09:30]  He's ripping off Neil Diamond.  Yeah.  It really does count a little Neil-ish.  That is not that sad.  What happened?  No.  Who knows?  The kid had fucking some kind of problem?  No, I think the mother had a problem.  Just neglected him?  Yeah, neglected.  Drug addicts, whatever.  But fucking Cats in the Cradle is a much sadder song than that.  Like the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon.  The fucking kid, he teaches him to throw the ball and he wants,  I want to be like you, dad, and he's getting fucking fresh.  And he ends up just like his dad.  He's busy. 
[02:10:00]  Being a piece of shit that's too busy to be with his son.  It's just about life getting busy.  He's like, eh.  No, you could take some time.  He long since retired.  My son's moved away.  A man is never a true man.  Unless he spends time with his family.  That's a good point.  But he fucking called him up the other day.  And the kid's got the flu.  The kid's got the flu.  What are you going to do?  You better get your head and your ass wired together,  or I will take a giant shit on you.  That's the way you teach your kids.  Time to die.  Die.  The most depressing song you've ever heard, 
[02:10:30]  according to I hate myself when I die.  Can I guess?  Go ahead.  I'm going to guess.  Go ahead, Anthony.  The Christmas shoes.  My daughter married it.  Well, forget it.  Oh.  I didn't say what.  No, I don't.  I never heard Christmas shoes.  It's a song by New Song.  I don't know.  I heard like, you know, Sal.  My mom and Sal.  Yeah.  Just will burst into tears spontaneously during this song. 
[02:11:00]  Are you kidding?  Around Christmas.  He's a pretty tough guy.  Yeah, but Sal's just gotten older.  You know, the old days when we used to be out on the boat,  he's cruising around the Great South Bay in this huge sea ray,  drinking CC's.  Drunk.  Getting all hammered.  Cruising through the fog.  Laughing at shit.  Who cares?  Put your shoelaces untied, you know?  Yeah.  And now, you know, Christmas shoes come on and, oh, this is, Ro, this is so sad.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Ro.  Baldingmore accent. 
[02:11:30]  Baldingmore.  Why don't we listen to a piece of, uh.  Ro.  That's fucking the accent.  Ro.  Ro.  Why don't we listen to a piece of the Christmas shoes by New Song.  All right?  The most depressing song you've ever heard.  Day is never finished.  Massey got me working.  Someday Massey sent me free.  Now listen, you communists and niggers and Jews.  Tell all your buddies to spread the news.  The judgment will soon be nigh.  As the Lord in his wisdom looks down the morning high. 
[02:12:00]  Will his battle be lost by mixing the races?  We want beautiful babies, not ones with brown faces.  Never, never, never I say, for the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay.  Never, never, never I say, for the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay.  That ain't it?  No.  I thought it was.  I actually have the most depressing song you've ever heard over here.  Oh, right?  You got a little confused. 
[02:12:30]  Okay.  Here it is.  The house next door to me's been sold to niggers.  They claim to be wild Indians from the plains.  This is not the most depressing song ever.  It's the most depressing thing to happen to the neighbor.  Weird-colored people.  That's not right. 
[02:13:00]  That is so wrong.  No, I mean the house being sold.  I just want to go on record and say that that was suggested by our own true boogie, by the way.  It was not.  Don't lie to us.  I deny everything.  You did not just write that down, huh?  Oh, my God.  Oh, was that great.  Teresa in Florida.  Teresa.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What do you say, Terry?  Teresa.  Oh, that song was horrible.  There's a sadder song out there than any other song.  It's Flowers for Mama by Red Sovine. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, Flowers for Mama.  Yeah, Flowers for Mama.  By who?  By Red Sovine.  Sovine.  He's a trucker singer.  I never heard that.  He's on truckers and talking to the others.  How does it go?  Oh, God.  Just a little bit.  See, I might have heard it.  I can kind of tell you what it's about.  No, just sing a little.  Oh, just a verse of it.  Who cares?  Just a little verse.  Oh. 
[02:14:00]  No, you guys want to make some of it?  No, I actually want to know the song because the title is familiar.  Yeah.  Um, Flowers for a Little...  Sing it.  Sing it, Teresa.  Sing it.  It'd be great.  I can't remember the words.  It took me like a half an hour to think of who sung the song.  Someone got a pitch pipe?  You got a pitch pipe?  Clear to feel some men are going to do some drinking.  Go ahead, Teresa.  You can sing it.  All right.  I can't sing it.  Here's Teresa.  She's going to sing a little piece of the song for us.  And Teresa.  Go.  You're on.  Go.  Just a little bit. 
[02:14:30]  Every second that ticks away is valuable radio time.  Here we go.  Let's go.  Teresa.  Flowers for a...  Oh, you son of a bitch.  Perfect.  I hope she's still belting it out as the trooper pulls her over.  All right.  Can we...  Can we hear a...  Yeah, let's hear the number one.  This is new song, The Christmas Shoes.  Let's listen to the most depressing song you've ever heard according to I Hate Myself and Want 
[02:15:00]  to Die.  Very touching.  This dumb book.  Aww.  And Sal really cries.  Oh, yeah.  Like by this part, he'll be bawling.  Christmas Shoes by Paul McCartney.  Christmas Shoe.  It was almost Christmas time.  And there I stood in another line.  Trying to buy that last gift or two.  Not really in the Christmas mood. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Because I'm a Jew.  Standing right in front of me was a little boy waiting anxiously.  Oh, what's wrong with the boy?  Oh, boy.  That's probably child molester.  And in his hands he held a pair of shoes.  A pair of shoes.  The kid's got some shoes.  And his clothes were worn and old.  Yeah, old.  He was dirty from head to toe.  And when it came his time to pay. 
[02:16:00]  I couldn't believe what I heard him say.  Here it is.  Hold onto your hats, kids.  Sir, I wanna buy these shoes.  Yeah.  For my mama, please.  Please.  It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size.  Could you hurry, sir?  Hurry.  Daddy says there's not much time.  Not much time.  You see, she's been sick for quite a while. 
[02:16:30]  Know these shoes will make a smile.  Oh, she won't be needing new shoes there, will she?  Why don't you buy her a Christmas diaper?  I'm calling Jesus tonight.  How about a New Year's Eve satin pillow?  He wants his shoes so she has nice shoes.  Oh, fuck.  I'm stealing like the black kids do. 
[02:17:00]  Now he's looking at the guy.  Mama made Christmas good at our house.  Most years she just did without.  Tell me, sir, what am I gonna do?  Here's what he told him.  You have best to fuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and check down your neck!  Jesus!  So I laid the money down.  I just had to help him out. 
[02:17:30]  And I'll never forget the look on his face.  What'd he say?  Mama's gonna look so gray.  So gray?  You're a liar!  That's right.  Goddamn liar!  What, do the shoes match the outfit you're gonna bury her in?  You fucking depressing waist.  And these shoes are just her size.  They're just her size.  Could you hurry soon?  Hurry up.  They're small because she's Japanese and Daddy binds her feet with blocks. 
[02:18:00]  You see, she's been sick for quite a while.  No, these shoes will make her smile.  Want her to look beautiful.  If Mama meets Jesus tonight.  Oh!  I knew I'd call her grams of heaven's love.  As he thanked me and ran out.  What does Mama have?  You will be molested. 
[02:18:30]  You will be molested.  To remind me.  I hope Mama doesn't have cancer.  You should get her a Christmas wig.  My Christmas is all about.  Sir, I wanna buy these shoes.  Oh!  Why did you do that?  Why did you admit everyone loving me?  And these shoes.  As Mama's illness drains the inheritance, you better trip over that Christmas plug.  Would you kindly shut your noise hole? 
[02:19:00]  You see, she's been sick for quite a while.  Yeah, we got it.  Get up, you giant man, dog.  What's wrong with her?  You need to shut the fuck up!  Mommy sees us tonight.  Sad.  Put on Nikes and then castrate her like fucking Marshall Applewhite.  The shoes, so she can catch the spaceship. 
[02:19:30]  Ugh, this song stinks.  Goddamn rich cunt!  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  Oh, that was like one of those fucking Little Marky songs.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's go to Leroy in Pennsylvania.  Leroy!  Fuck Mama and her new shoes.  They'll just lay there and fucking bum everybody out as usual. 
[02:20:00]  Fuck Mama.  Somebody oughta call Bob Kelly, she'd be crying right now.  Of course he is.  He's humping a sink.  In tears.  Mama's a fucking downtrodden cunt with the sniffles.  Telling to tough it out and fucking be sick in January.  Ruined Christmas for everybody.  Exactly.  Self-centered twat, Mama.  All right, well there you go.  Little kid can't even buy shoes.  He should be taught to shop.  If Mama was so good she would have raised him to shop in November.  Right.  Not Christmas Eve during the rush.  What do you think?  Jesus wants to see someone come up to heaven and fuck me pumps? 
[02:20:30]  Put those away kid, they're inappropriate.  They're like fucking Roman sandals where you fucking tie them all the way up.  Horseshoes.  Horseshoes.  She goes up to St. Peter and he won't let her in.  Take off those horseshoes and put on heavenly loafers.  Who gave you those?  We're gonna kill him immediately.  The saddest, uh, there it is song ever.  That song eats ass.  Fucking Christmas shoes. 
[02:21:00]  Oh fuck yourself.  This is Paul Provenza here and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's gonna be a long show.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Remind me to tell you this story.  I went to another spa when I was at the Borgata.  I went down to the spa and I had no bathing suit.  Why do you, why do you conveniently end up in these spas without the right things?  And you know, because based on last few times, the last few times, that something is gonna happen if you do this. 
[02:21:30]  Jimmy's doing oopsies.  Yeah.  Oopsie again.  Jimmy's doing oopsies.  No, no, no.  Oopsie yet again.  Forgot my bathing suit.  Might as well go in nude.  Oops!  We drove from Boston late at night to get down to, uh, Atlantic City.  Made great time in like six hours, which is really good for Boston.  Borgata has a spa that opens at seven in the morning.  So I wanted to get some steam before I went to bed.  It's just better for the breathing.  Clear, clear out the steam. 
[02:22:00]  Kenny offered me his bathing suit, which is just fucking creepy.  So I said no.  God knows what's in there.  I went down.  Big mustache.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Semen leaking out like where the back is.  I went downstairs into, uh, I went down to the, uh, area, the steam area, the spa,  and I, uh, checked in in front of, they give you a robe.  I can't look at a robe now without just giggling.  Can't put one on.  I was at the hotel over the weekend, I put on a robe to get the door for room service, 
[02:22:30]  and I'm just like, I open the door and go, uh-huh, uh-huh.  And he doesn't get the joke, just gives me my broth.  I, uh, put my robe on, I went into the steam room, I cleared myself out a little bit.  It was kind of, I had a towel on.  I was nude.  But I always put a towel on.  And then opened my legs much farther than necessary.  Oopsie.  While another gentleman is sitting across from me.  Yeah.  Jimmy and his oopsies.  Oopsies.  So I get into the whirlpool, which was not hot, by the way.  There's no one in there but me.  Um, there was some guys in the steam room, there was guys in the area sleeping. 
[02:23:00]  Um.  The bums.  These gambler idiots.  So I'm sitting there naked in the whirlpool.  And I was looking down at my legs and my hairless cock.  And I had to get out, I looked like the cover of our Nirvana record.  I was disgusted with myself.  I put a dollar bill on a hook trying to chase you around the pool.  I'm hairless and my cock was floating up and it looked like a baby cock. 
[02:23:30]  What?  I had to leave.  Why were you naked in there?  I didn't have a bathing suit.  There was no one in there.  There was no one in the water.  I don't care.  That's acceptable.  At some point someone's gonna get in the water.  That's not as bad as that.  No, it's not bad at all actually.  It's gay.  You didn't know, what do you predict that no one's gonna come in?  Well when they do, what do you think I'm gonna do?  Sit there and be sexually assaulted?  I'll get out if they come near me.  What if a child walks in?  Well that's his fucking bad luck. 
[02:24:00]  He'll listen next time when mother is warning him.  And I'm not a pedophile at all, but sometimes it's about teaching the lesson.  So that was my, and of course my massage yesterday.  How'd that go?  Good.  I thought I was doing great.  It was like a mutual touch massage.  Giving her like a really soft rub.  Wait a minute.  Mutual touch.  Can I set this up by the way?  You sure can.  A little bit.  You played to a sold out crowd in Boston at the Orphium Theater.  Not close to sold out, over 200 people.  Pretty close.  Yes. 
[02:24:30]  You killed.  And then you were in Atlantic City killing.  Yep, 2,500 people.  And then you came home to New York, what, yesterday or late Saturday?  Yes.  And then you got a massage to treat yourself I guess?  Well because I'm basically a zero.  Yeah.  And I know that.  But they see you up on the stage.  They think you're a rock star.  It means nothing.  They don't.  They know you're just.  I'm garbage.  They do know I'm garbage.  They do know actually.  That's why half the guys relate to me because they know that my life is shit.  In that regard I cannot find a happy relationship.  So I'm getting a massage and I'm giving her a massage.  And it's just supposed to be a strict massage. 
[02:25:00]  So I kiss her thighs a little bit.  Uh oh.  And she lets me.  She's like oh.  How are you down by her.  What position.  She was laying on my bed.  On her back.  Massage.  She's laying.  She's laying on your bed.  Wait.  She's laying.  No no it wasn't mutual massage at the same time.  She's laying in your bed on her back but she's there to massage.  Oh it's not same time.  Yeah no I didn't mind.  It was like a light touch.  I thought it was like a 69 thing.  No no no no.  She's laying on her stomach and then I'm touching the back of her thighs.  Do you massage first or last?  I've never done that before where I massage at all. 
[02:25:30]  Oh.  But this one I did first.  And I just wanted to see how someone would respond to it.  And she's getting the goosebumps.  It was like a little light touch tantric thing.  So she rolls over on her back.  And I kind of like you know I'm just gently.  Well that's sort of like the hello.  It was sexy yeah.  Your signal is like.  Is she covered with anything?  No she's nude.  She's nude and she rolls over on her back?  Yeah.  Alright that's hello now.  I'm brushing my hands gently over her skin.  Yeah.  And I go up by her nipples.  And I touch the nipple.  I'm not sure if she's going to let me.  Yeah.  And she does.  And her nipple gets hard. 
[02:26:00]  And then I kind of.  I kiss her knees a little bit.  And like her.  Like where her.  In the inner part of her arm.  Like where her arm bends.  And she doesn't stop me.  And then I kiss like where the leg.  Did you have that dopey breathe right strip on?  No I didn't.  Okay.  It was breathe right stripless.  I kiss where the leg meets the body.  And her legs part a little bit.  Oh Jesus.  And she moans.  And I feel.  You know I touch the front of her lips.  And I feel that she's wet.  And she's turned on.  So you know.  I'm just.  Lick your nipple a little bit.  And she lets me. 
[02:26:30]  You smashed her head with a brick.  Cut her head right off.  Fucked her.  Well her head was in a bowling bag.  Came all over the floor.  And then me and Otis Toole went out.  And had a pabst.  No I wound up brushing her stomach.  And I wound up like kissing by her.  By her pussy.  And you know I wound up sneaking my tongue over there.  Uh huh.  And the next thing you know I'm licking it.  Yeah.  But I didn't know she was going to allow that.  Licking it well.  At this point.  But you never know.  You could.  You have carte blanche to anything. 
[02:27:00]  My dick was as hard.  And as fucking lovely as it's ever been.  And I'm standing at the edge of the bed.  It was right by her hand.  And she grabs it.  And she's jerking me off.  And it was fucking amazing.  I'm eating her.  She's going crazy.  And I'm playing with her nipples.  And I'm fucking.  So I finally come around and kneel on the bed.  And I'm kneeling up by her face with my rod.  And she's jerking me off.  And I'm trying to ease it towards her mouth.  You want some action.  Yeah.  And she won't suck it.  So I'm like alright.  Let me just try to fuck her.  So I start like kissing. 
[02:27:30]  I think I'm doing such a good job too.  Oh no.  Because I'm like licking her pussy.  You know it's Jimmy.  So this just has to end badly.  She's getting into it.  And the way like I'm licking it.  I'm lifting her leg a little bit.  And the next thing you know.  She's on her back.  And I'm kind of like kneeling on the bed.  Licking her pussy with her one leg draped over my back now.  I'm slowly.  It's like fucking a Brazilian jujitsu move.  I'm trying to work my way in.  For a leg lock.  So I'm kind of like you know.  I'm kissing her pussy again.  I push her leg over.  Open a little bit more.  And I scoop my little fat torso in. 
[02:28:00]  Oh boy.  Now she knows what's coming.  Yeah.  And then the next thing you know.  I'm kneeling between her legs.  And she's jerking me while I lean over and lick her nipples.  And I'm trying to just push it up against the lips.  Yeah.  Now there's a problem because I don't have a condom.  And I'm not going to stick it in without a condom.  Problem for her.  Oh for her.  Yeah for me.  No problem.  You don't care.  I didn't even know if I could.  I wanted to see what her vibe was on the whole thing to begin with.  Uh huh.  And she wouldn't let me touch it.  And but she's really turned on. 
[02:28:30]  I'm like she wants to fuck.  And she goes you want to do that don't you?  I'm like yeah.  She goes that's a lot more money.  I'm like oh.  Fucker.  Wow wow wow wow.  She was rude.  AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW AW WILLIAM  Good lord.  Shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  She was really good.  I thought I was doing so well. 
[02:29:00]  You just thought you were doing good.  Oh, her pussy was wet, probably thinking of all the money she was about to get from stupid.  He's just kid a little fucking manners.  And I'm like, of course I said the thing any man with dignity would say.  How much more?  How much?  And she goes, how much do you think it's worth?  And I'm like, I don't know.  And she's like, well, I've never done this before.  And I'm thinking, oh, you lying twat.  That means $1.20.  Very expensive.  So she goes, because the massage was going to be $200, which is pretty average, I think, for a tantric massage. 
[02:29:30]  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  She goes, I'm like, how much?  And she goes, a thousand.  A thousand.  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want the tears to come out of my eyes?  I'm like, um, pesos?  Rupals?  Thank you, Ken.  A thousand dollars she wanted.  So I laid on my back, and I wish I had a photo of my hog. 
[02:30:00]  It was in fantastic shape, and she threw lotion on it, and I just caused a real ruckus on myself.  You just made the mess.  Yeah.  You thought it was, uh, you thought it was going to end in romance.  I thought she was into it, because her pretty face, she was moaning, and she, I'm very rarely taken off guard like that.  She was good.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Yeah, that's, uh, wow.  What a tragic story that I saw coming a mile away.  Of course you did, because I'm what you call a zilch. 
[02:30:30]  Do you think, if you were like, a model guy, that she would have just done it?  Acting the same way, because, now, of course, no one's as good as Jimmy like that.  I don't know.  Kissing and everything.  But do you think if, you know, you were-  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because I was giving her a good enough head.  Because didn't it seem like she was getting turned on?  Yeah.  Physically?  My rod looked good enough, where if she was really horny, she would have.  I don't know about that.  Probably. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Bastard.  Should have cut her head off.  You're right.  And I should have fucking pulled an Edmund Kemper.  Should have fucking slaughtered my mother's best friend, and then talked to my mom while  her fucking laid his head was in a bowling bag.  How do you not love Edmund Kemper?  Six-six highway killer.  Or the California co-ed killer he was.  Look him up.  Someone was calling it the old master bait and switch.  Dude, I thought I was doing so well.  I am just a fucking zero.  It's amazing to me. 
[02:31:30]  And you still get bamboozled into thinking.  I still get hoodwinked.  And there are women that like me, and there are women that I like, but there's always  a problem.  There's always something else.  Yeah.  You know, there's always something negative attached to it, where it's just not going to  develop into anything.  That is a tragic story.  Oh.  Well.  I'll have this fucking smoothie.  All right.  It must have just been Firehose City, though.  And, uh...  It was an embarrassing amount of cum.  Jesus. 
[02:32:00]  It was.  It was the type of cum where you're going, I've never cum this much.  I apologize that your hand is so tired because I'm continually cumming.  It sounded like somebody was doing jumping jacks in the mud with rubber shoes.  I said, go ahead, honey.  Take a break.  And then my cock hovered, and she came back 20 minutes later, and it finished it.  A wading pool of cum all over my fat, colorless stomach. 
[02:32:30]  You can't tell where the cum ends and my skin begins.  I'm the color of a load.  I really need a fucking tanning lamp.  I'm the color of a viscous-y load.  Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Hey, good morning, Jimmy.  Good morning, guys.  Jim, I've heard of the disease age or stuff like that.  I mean, the last thing you knew we need to take the funny other show is you, you know,  in a bathrobe, 90 pounds.  No, I wasn't going to put it in without a rubber. 
[02:33:00]  I mean, I'm a perv, but I'm not an idiot.  I'm not...  Yeah, but you're going down on her.  I mean, you don't think your tongue's going to fall off?  No.  Dude, I believe me.  If I was on top of the clit, I'm not a dope.  I didn't lick all the way down between the lips.  I was on top of the clit.  There's no AIDS up there.  No, there's really not.  There's nothing on the clit.  The clit's fine.  No.  No AIDS over there?  Absolutely not.  The AIDS can't climb that high.  It doesn't.  I'm all about AIDS from eating a girl's clit.  But I wouldn't...  A girl like that, I would never put my mouth, like, on the lips or between...  I just wouldn't.  I mean, I...  It would bother me more than it would turn me on. 
[02:33:30]  It's like trying to climb Mount Everest.  They just give up at one of the base camps down below.  I know.  There's a little Sherpa on the lip hauling HIV.  Thank you, Ope.  That deserves something from him.  But he sipped the smoothie and ignored me.  People are asking, how are we sipping smoothies?  As Jimmy's just talking about his loads.  How are you sipping them?  You want to see them.  They're dumping them on their backs and licking them off each other.  It's really a homoerotic thing.  Viscousy smoothie.  You ever come so hard?  It's fucking white and clear with a little yellow tinge in there. 
[02:34:00]  It was an embarrassing amount of semen.  I'm sorry, lady, that I came so much on my fat fish belly.  Because the more I came, the more she had to look at my stomach.  Like, fucking jerked me off.  Blurker, blurker, blurker, blurker, blurker.  Blurker, blurker, blurker, blurker.  Sorry.  Goes to the left on the comforter.  Blurker, blurker, blurker, blurker.  Blurker, blurker, blurker, blurker.  Holy shit.  That was a load. 
[02:34:30]  Rachel.  I fucking came.  To quote John Fox, I came like a busted sprinkler head.  I fucking shot a load.  It looked like a fucking paintball fight on my stomach with one gun.  With clear, viscous-y, thick paint in it.  Oh, did I come good. 
[02:35:00]  Blurker, blurker.  That's exactly what it sounded like.  And I swear to God, as she's jerking me,  fucking, she's not getting her thousand,  so she's peeking back at the clock.  Clock watcher.  That's what it sounds like.  Blurker, blurker, blurker, blurker.  Blurker, blurker, blurker.  Her fucking shattered dreams and my destroyed ego  all in one glop on my fat belly.  What a brilliant idea. 
[02:35:30]  The fucking porn in the news.  All I ever did when I was a kid is my friend Scott,  he had a fucking cat box full of cat shit,  so I would get drunk and then take the daily paper  and put all the cat shit in it  and then put it back on the table  so when his father opened the paper,  cat shit fell on him.  What a great gag.  What a scumbag you are.  Yeah.  He's now back in the hall after a hard day at work  and opened it  and six or seven little cat turds  would fucking fall all over him. 
[02:36:00]  What a douchebag.  I would get drunk.  We would always get drunk in his house  and I would just urinate all over his faucets.  I was like big.  I remember being drunk in his bathroom.  I remember being drunk in his bathroom  and I'm pissing all over the mirror  and his fucking faucet handles  and all over the floor.  Why?  I don't know.  It just made me laugh to do so.  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  It sounds so good.  Oh, is that funny?  We might have lost your mic, Jimmy.  We lost your mic when you were moving around. 
[02:36:30]  I don't know what you did.  It's probably the connection.  There you go.  Just smack it a couple of times.  Why would it work?  Perfect.  Is that good?  No, it's making a hissing noise.  No, that one's good now.  No, that one stinks.  It's broken.  It's busted.  Well, there's a whole thing up here.  How's that, fam?  Is that on the radio?  Yes, you're on the radio.  Oh, I like this one better.  It makes me feel like an old-time broadcaster.  You were a real fucked-up drunk.  Oh, it was a naughty boy. 
[02:37:00]  Wow.  Just going to start pissing on people's fucking faucets.  But I mean really pissing on it.  Not just the quick throw?  No.  Like, did you use the toilet at all during that session?  I wouldn't have noticed it if there was a...  There could have been a fucking flowers coming out of it for all I know.  Wow.  No, why even open the fucking lid?  Certainly not.  Oh, God, that is funny.  That is really fucking funny.  And then me and Tom Naylor would fucking get dog shit,  like big wet pieces of dog shit  and put them in glad baggies  and then throw them down the library book return slot. 
[02:37:30]  Some poor old lady just...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And we threw shit without baggies, too.  But I mean, we had to carry it for a while.  She's just volunteering her stupid time.  She has to deal with your shenanigans.  People's books sliding down into the shit.  She's just trying to shush people.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  And the shitty books.  Oh, we were awful at shit.  Oh.  All right.  Wow, that is really funny.  Cat shit in the newspaper rules are. 
[02:38:00]  I suggest it to anyone.  Because this cat shit stinks so bad,  and you know there's going to be a couple of pellets of fucking litter in it.  He just picks it up and it falls in his lap.  Do you know how surreal that is when you come home after a long day's work  and you want to just read the paper,  and the next thing you know there's animal shit in your lap?  You know how bad that cat must have got hit?  He thought that the cat did it.  Snuck over there, opened the paper, and shit, and closed it.  And closed the paper.  And then refolded it properly.  Oh, is that great. 
[02:38:30]  Wow, are you a fucking degenerate.  I love it.  I was garbage.  Oh, God.  Nothing was better than that.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Shit in people's mailboxes.  Who would do that?  You were big on the shit thing.  Funniest thing I've ever seen in my life, and I mean ever.  When I was six or seven, and my friend Mark Rosenberg, we were sitting there in the fucking grass.  I love how he uses the real names.  It just makes the stories that much better.  Mark leaned back, and he put his hand.  You've never seen a more fucking butterscotch pile of fucking wet dog shit. 
[02:39:00]  It was as fresh as the fucking, I'm surprised the dog wasn't actually walking away when he did it.  He put his hand, he leaned back for a casual chat in the grass, and stuck his hand in this pile of shit.  And it's the funniest thing.  I've never seen anything funnier.  That was 32 years ago.  Oh, shit.  And nothing has come close.  Where you just doubled over crying laughing.  It was incomprehensibly funny. 
[02:39:30]  Like, as a child, I didn't realize that anything could make you feel that kind of emotion.  And that's all it took.  And women think they understand what funny is.  That's what funny is.  Hey, oh.  God damn, that is good.  Andrea Pizer.  I guess that she never called.  Do we have an update?  God damn.  Are we trying to get Andrea Pizer on the...  Dan?  Steve?  Can't get her on the phone from the New York Post?  Love that.  Hey, story of the day.  It's time for story of the day.  And remind me to tell you the stories of when we would drive by with cups and throw urine on people in New Brunswick. 
[02:40:00]  That was our favorite activity.  We would drive around, me and my friend Looch.  He was like 35 and he hung out with the teenagers.  Oh, creepy guy.  Yeah, he drove a fucking Volkswagen Bug and we would drink and I would piss into cups.  And we would just drive through New Brunswick and throw it on people.  And I fucking...  I had...  I would leave the little...  Oh, we got some good ones.  And I fucking had a plastic cup with a plastic lid on it.  And I'll never forget there was a couple walking. 
[02:40:30]  And I fucking threw it and the arc was beautiful.  And the guy put his arm up to block it.  And it hit his arm.  And piss went all over him and his girl.  Oh, would I be so fucking limited.  Because he had to be steamed.  We would drive around with eggs and egg people all the time.  I got a guy in New Brunswick.  He probably remembers that.  Yeah.  That guy probably fucking remembers that shit.  That guy remembers me and hit putting his arm up in just slow motion having his cup hit him. 
[02:41:00]  And he's probably, if he's listening, he's probably told himself for the last 25 years it was beer.  No.  No, it wasn't.  I told you.  I told you guys.  My friend fucking Stanley and Mike.  Stanley was the bodybuilder.  We were 13 playing Asteroids.  And Mike was 13.  And so Stanley...  Stanley wasn't gay.  He was just a fucking not a smart guy.  He was a martial artist.  Me, him, and Mike would just drive around in his rickety old truck.  And they would show up with margarine dishes full of motor oil.  And we would just go to people's open car windows and, like, throw the fucking motor oil all over the inside of their car on their console. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, you fucking scumbags.  And I remember one time Stan ate some Chinese food and Mike had the hot mustard.  And we saw some pretty girl.  And Mike went, hey, whore, have some mustard.  And he threw it at her and she waved.  And then she waved the mustard at her.  Hey, whore.  Hey, whore.  He was a sociopath.  Because I remember...  Oh, shit. 
[02:42:00]  You all were.  We were driving.  It was, like, 100 degrees out.  We saw this guy hitchhiking backwards with no shirt.  And fucking Mike goes, hey, Stanley, let's fucking...  Let's drain some...  Let's drain the engine oil and drive back and throw some hot oil on him.  He wanted to drain oil out of the hot engine and throw it on a guy's bare chest while he was hitchhiking.  And he meant it.  Ah!  Let's go throw hot oil on him, Stanley. 
[02:42:30]  Fucking...  1353?  Dude, what's the hot oil?  We found one time the holy grail.  We were in a parking lot and we found a half a dish of melted chocolate ice cream.  And there was an open car window with one of those fur seat backs.  Oh, we smushed it all over the seat back.  We drove by five minutes later and there was an elderly couple.  They had to be in their 70s.  And they were outside the car and she's wiping chocolate off his back. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, he must have been so hot under the collar.  He sat down and got fucking chocolate all over his old back.  Oh, it was perfect.  Oh, that was a good one.  All over his old back.  Oh, he just...  He was...  I'll never forget him standing there and her behind him just wiping at his back.  Oh, are you a fuck? 
[02:43:30]  Norton was a fucking minist.  He really was.  Hey, Stanley.  Let's go back and throw hot oil on him.  Let's get a Paul in Nashville.  Paul.  Fucking minist.  He's a minist.  Paul.  Fucking laugh.  My fingers.  Paul.  Yes.  Go.  Let's go.  One of the best places to take a crap to piss someone off is to get up on the green at  a golf course.  Sit there and fill the hole full of shit because you know that first golfer...  He taps in, reaches in, grabs his ball, and gets a handful of shit. 
[02:44:00]  That's a good one.  That's all the answer.  Damn good one.  That's a damn good one.  That's right.  He's standing there.  Oh, that guy...  I'll never forget the guy on the shoulder backwards hitchhiking with no shirt.  You know, it is also a good one with the old person and his wife wiping his back off.  How long did it take for him to sit there until he realized his back was in something?  It couldn't have been long because it was fur and we coated it with melted chocolate ice cream. 
[02:44:30]  You don't understand.  It was the holy grail of fun.  It was hot.  It was summer.  Wide open window.  His mistake.  I wish there wasn't a statute of limitations.  Just like, you can come fucking arrest this idiot.  Oh, fuck.  That was a good one.  What a creep.  Yeah.  That wasn't even the...  Ah, shit.  Yeah.  He was going to say that wasn't even the beginning.  No, we wrote it.  Then we killed him.  Both of them.  They had the pickup truck one time and they had a couch, a giant old sofa on it.  So we set the sofa on fire and pushed it off the truck onto the highway. 
[02:45:00]  We were hoping a car would hit it.  There's people in jail right now for six of the things he's talking about.  Did you ever think of consequences?  No.  We were 13, man.  Yeah, but I mean...  Stanley should have.  He was 25.  Holy shit.  Stanley, I don't know what Stanley was doing.  I know.  We had an old Volkswagen bug in the back of a pickup truck once and took it down the road  at about 60, 70 miles an hour and held onto the bed, the back of the bed, and kicked this 
[02:45:30]  thing out and just watched it like chasing the car as it was rolling.  And it was so good.  And we were going to do that and then just leave.  But nothing happened.  Like, there weren't any cops.  There wasn't an explosion.  People didn't come out or anything.  So we backed up, lifted it back into the truck so we could do it again.  It was so amazing looking to watch this thing just roll.  I remember one time me and my friend Marvin, he was a Puerto Rican Jew, Marvin Schnoll, 
[02:46:00]  who was a good friend of mine.  We were hitchhiking, trick-or-treating.  And one guy, we knocked on his door and he didn't have any.  He said, I don't have no candy.  No.  Poor fuck.  So Marvin took his gum out and put it over the guy's peephole at his door.  So we're out in the yard.  Five seconds later, the older man runs out and grabs Marvin and puts him in a headlock  and starts punching the top of his head.  And I just stood there in my Halloween costume and watched.  What were you dressed at? 
[02:46:30]  I don't remember.  Darth Vader or something?  I just watched Marvin's...  Real evil Darth Vader.  Yeah.  Just watching your friend get pummeled.  Yeah, well, I held a fucking bag full of pennies in Milky Ways.  Oh, is that fucking funny?  No, I remember when we were talking about...  What was the thing you were talking about with the embarrassing stories?  Remember that shit?  What's the thing in school?  You ever remember something that's so embarrassing to this day when you think about it, you go,  oh.  We were talking about the...  I guess the douche chill would be the way we describe it now.  We had a talk one night about the most...  Those moments. 
[02:47:00]  They're not embarrassing like, yeah, I farted and this chick smelled it.  Not exposure-type embarrassing.  Things were like, wow.  Oh, who I am is just garbage.  Yeah.  Like, humiliating little moments.  And for me, one of them...  It's not even that...  It's awful.  Do you understand?  Like, one of them...  And you just think back and go, oh.  Yeah.  I was in class.  I was in class.  And there was a whole class full of people. 
[02:47:30]  It was dead silent.  And this guy walked by the outside of the classroom door.  And I was, I think, a sophomore in freshman high school.  Freshman high school.  And there's seniors in the class.  There's a math class.  And the guy walked by the outside door.  And he was singing.  And the song he was singing had the beat of...  Da, da, da, da.  It might have been a Christmas song.  But the guy was singing...  Bop, bop, bop, bop.  And I wanted to say, shut the fuck up.  Which would have probably gotten a big laugh. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  But I bailed out.  And I went, shut up.  Silence.  The class was silent.  Oh, you bombed.  It was horrible how unfunny it was.  It was crawl out of your skin embarrassing.  It was completely humiliating.  Yeah.  He had a much better one. 
[02:48:30]  His was really awful.  I used to be the captain of the football team.  Yeah.  And I used to be the hype man.  You know, like, how y'all feel?  And the team go, fire it up.  How y'all feel?  Fire it up.  Break down.  Stick.  Break down.  You know, getting them all ready.  Yeah.  So one day we're playing this team for Halloween, right?  So I said, y'all ready, baby?  Y'all ready to fuck this team?  And they're like, yeah.  And I said, because they're going to get a trick.  And we're going to get a treat. 
[02:49:00]  And everybody went, oh.  During the breakdowns.  Breakdown.  And we're going to get a treat.  Oh, boy.  I don't even want to look at them.  Did they just lose on purpose?  They said, what the fuck?  We won.  But it was like, they just took away all my power with that.  It was so.  I would just let you get hit all the time the whole game. 
[02:49:30]  Were you embarrassed?  Oh, how embarrassing.  This was 18 years ago.  And it was the worst.  Oh, is that embarrassing?  Hi, this is Jim Norton.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  So put on your laughing hats and teabag a relative.  You have the worst radio voice, though.  Funny line, worst radio voice ever.  That's a good radio guy voice.  It's awful.  Hey, how are you?  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Something like that with a little more bass in your voice.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:50:00]  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Ooh, who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Are we getting mousetraps or what?  I hope so.  We better be.  We're going to have to clear this off.  Holy shit.  Wow, we came up with a good idea during the break.  What can I tell you?  Hand it over to her. 
[02:50:30]  Hell no.  Fucking hand it over.  Hell no.  She's got to learn a lesson in life.  This is a lot of money.  You've got to pay for whatever you get.  What do we got?  Why are they coming in?  Danny.  Dwayne Reed probably got some.  Wendy.  Danny and Fanny.  We need about 10 mousetraps.  10 would be good.  6, whatever.  We could reset them.  6 to 10 we need.  Authentic, regular, snapping mousetraps.  That's right.  Nothing fancy.  Tom and Jerry.  That's right.  Yeah, Tom and Jerry's. 
[02:51:00]  Classic Acme mousetraps.  I got the bit.  All right.  I got it.  It all came together.  A little more evilness is thrown in.  It all came together because we're like naked, dancing naked, mousetraps.  Okay, here's the deal.  We clear off the console here, right?  We get Stalker Paddy completely naked, okay?  All right.  Mousetraps all over the place.  The check that the listeners are giving her through us.  Yes.  All right?  Blindfolded has to find.  Oh, that's genius.  That's genius.  That's brilliant. 
[02:51:30]  Ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you.  Greg Opie Hughes.  Greg Opie Hughes.  Thank you.  Genius.  Coming through.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the shit that should be on the message boards.  Thank you.  When the subject of what we do on the show, how we all contribute.  This is why I'm here.  Yes.  I want a fucking thread.  This is why the all-star team is the point guard of the league.  Started on what?  Because that brings it all together.  Look, I'm not going to score 81 like Kobe, but I'm going to have a lot of assists during 
[02:52:00]  that game.  That is brilliant.  The check itself is part of the bait.  Right.  And now reaching down naked, trying to find it amongst set-mouthed-ass.  Does she have a time limit?  A time limit?  Or that's too evil.  Until she's fucking screaming in pain.  I'm just going to guess that it's going to be hidden really well.  Yes.  I'm just going to go out on a limb there and say it's going to be difficult to find.  Yes.  Yes.  This is what you could do on Saturday.  Oh, wow. 
[02:52:30]  We're running out of show here.  We're running out of show.  We cannot run out of show before this happens.  Get the pit crew in here.  We've got to get the stage ready.  All right.  I want to dance on the stage.  Yeah, the stage needs to be.  Oh, well.  All right.  The pit crew is coming in to get the stage ready.  Than, our own mayonnaise-filled E-Rock.  Yes.  Just oozing out of his pores.  E-Rock.  Hey, Maury.  Hellman's makes everything better.  Maury is rerunning the Patty show again today, by the way.  Are you kidding?  That's on right now?  They must have really loved that show.  We could give Maury another show topic if he likes. 
[02:53:00]  Well, this should be what Maury did with Patty.  Right.  But Maury doesn't have that evil creativity that Opie has.  Let's get Stalker Patty in here to set this thing up, okay?  All right.  Where's Patty?  Patty.  Patty.  She was talking to David Hinckley for a little while, huh?  Thanks for wrecking our interview with the Daily News.  You had to be the first person David talks to when he's going to do our interview today.  Hey.  The Daily News.  It was my pleasure to meet him. 
[02:53:30]  I've been reading his column for so many years.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Was he as thrilled to meet you as you were?  David Hinckley's thrilled.  Jesus, Patty, you turned years into 18 syllables.  How did that happen?  Year-years.  Year-years.  Year-years.  I read your cure for your year-years.  By the way, I like your show.  Thank you.  Your show.  It's a wheelie above a junkie.  Patty, you have cable? 
[02:54:00]  Well, yeah.  It comes with my friend.  With your pad.  Patty, are you coming in Friday for American Mess?  We want some of the past Messers to come in and help us choose new Messers for this show.  You know how they bring in old winners from American Idol to help out the new kids that are up and coming?  We want you as an old Mess from the show to come in and help out, give the kids some pointers.  We're finding new Messers starting this Friday.  It's an open call.  It's called American Mess.  It starts this Friday.  You just show up at the station if you think you've got something to offer to this program. 
[02:54:30]  Does Patty know why she's here today?  No.  He didn't say.  Usually they tell me why, but this time they didn't.  She has no clue.  Patty, what is the situation?  You've been in a lot of bad situations over the years since we've known you financially, mentally, I don't know, physically.  We always are there for you when you're at your lowest point to try to help you out.  No matter how badly it looks to some listeners that were abusing you, we're there helping you along the way. 
[02:55:00]  I appreciate it, too.  We have a temporary shelter in our studio stairwell.  Well, we had no choice in that because we made her leave her residence because the people that she was living with were trying to help her out.  Yeah.  And they said we were a bad influence on her and her life, and we told Patty to leave that residence.  Leave the house.  And she did.  Even though she had nowhere to go.  She became homeless.  Yeah.  She became homeless.  And then started living under the stairs at the old radio station with her pet rabbit.  Her stuffed pet rabbit.  Stuffed pet rabbit.  Then there were your hammer toes. 
[02:55:30]  You had hammer toes.  And we had them fixed up for you, didn't we?  Yes, you did.  Yes, we did.  They can fix that?  Two nice doctors on Long Island.  Exactly.  Patty, when you had a problem with maybe some excessive hair that you wanted removed?  Nipple hair.  Nipple hair.  Who was there for you?  You were.  Opie and Anthony.  We hired some Brazilian waxing people that came in and helped out with your nipple hair. 
[02:56:00]  When you were bald, suddenly you were suddenly for some reason bald.  Well, we shaved our head for money.  Oh, that's right.  That was us.  We shaved our head.  When we shaved your head and gave you U2 tickets and money, who gave you a wig?  You did.  And we say we help her out.  We're always there to help.  Even though Opie tried to take the wig from her on the middle of the street.  Who got you a makeover on Maury Povich?  You did.  Right.  A Maury makeover. 
[02:56:30]  You tried to take her wig?  Dude.  Oh, it's the cruelest.  Bill, it's one of the most classic moments on the Opie and Anthony show.  I started screaming, take the wig, and she's screaming.  It should be on OAVirus.com.  By the way, I'm not going to say what just came in.  Is that it?  Yeah.  All right, that came in in a bag.  Who went and got those?  Crazy Bill.  Crazy Bill in record time.  Again, Bill, one of the best interns ever.  Knowing exactly where to go to get supplies.  Knowing where to go, what to get.  Bang, bang, bang.  Job is done.  We're trying to get him some money.  He is a model intern.  He's just amazing. 
[02:57:00]  Amazing.  And a complete drugged out maniac, by the way.  We love him.  We think.  We don't know.  In my humble opinion.  Yeah.  In my expert opinion.  Expert opinion.  He's going to be on A&E one day.  Yeah.  You know, years ago, he wrote, I want to hold your hand.  But nowadays, it's just the greatest, most eclectic stuff, I think.  All right.  Patty, you have no idea why you're here.  No.  You're in a little trouble, aren't you, right now?  Well, yeah.  Financially?  What's your latest trouble?  Well, my latest trouble is three weeks ago, I lost my job. 
[02:57:30]  Because I knew how to take over.  We didn't get along.  And it's a river to be.  Wait, they fired you from Godiva?  Wait, this is new to me.  She did, yeah.  I didn't know you now don't have a job.  Well, it's okay.  Last I heard, wait, wait, wait.  I'm interviewing with Starbucks on the 31st, and I was told that that was a great company  to go for.  All right.  But last I heard.  You were a perfect employee for Godiva.  I know, but what can I tell you?  It's, you know, the big manager. 
[02:58:00]  I don't drink coffee.  I like chocolate.  You know.  Well, you do like, you do like, uh, cakey.  I like to come on the radio and hype it.  I'll still be a customer.  Huh?  Definitely.  Yeah.  You got fired from Godiva?  Well, yeah, but it was just the manager.  I guess she didn't like me.  It was a new manager.  It was 100% crew turnover, practically.  There's only one old person left.  Yeah, they like to bring in their own peeps.  They had a new company policy about using ChapStick.  Oh.  We got to get going.  Patty, Patty, the problem, though, was before I, this is new to me that you lost your job, 
[02:58:30]  but before that, you were having a problem paying the rent.  Yes, I did.  And you got behind.  I got a little behind, yes.  A little behind.  How far is a little behind in your rent?  2,000.  You're two grand deep in debt for rent on your place, and they're threatening to maybe remove you.  Well, not quite.  I'm dealing with social services, and it's been delayed because I'm working with social services.  It's been delayed, but now you don't have a job, so this is real trouble.  Well, I have unemployment. 
[02:59:00]  I'm getting $166 a week after I filed for it, so.  You are a mess.  Well, the listeners took it upon themselves.  They felt.  Patty, they felt for you.  The listeners set something up and felt for you and wanted to help you out.  The ONA Pests.  The ONA Pests came up with money for you to pay your rent.  Oh, I know.  I got a call.  There is a grand total of, Opie, pull out the checks.  They had a fundraiser, Patty, and the ONA Pests, they do do good as well as bad. 
[02:59:30]  They collected $2,000.  $2,000, Patty.  Oh, my God.  That they collected for you for the rent.  Now, here's the thing.  Now, if you know our show.  It would be so nice to just hand this over to you, right?  Has that ever happened, Patty?  Oh, the last time I was on the floor a year ago with a Krusty the Clown mask on, but that's 
[03:00:00]  not all just a little bit, well, naked.  You were completely naked, wearing nothing but a Krusty the Clown mask.  Yeah.  And every time I hear a worse stuff, that's one of the first things they do.  Fire her.  Now I understand why she got fired.  Do you like the chocolate with the truffles and the...  You're fired.  Those are one of my favorite sense-sense.  Could we have a mocha cup of Chino over here? 
[03:00:30]  I need a Ch-U-A-T.  She refused to pronounce Godiva correctly.  We got to move forward, though, guys, or we're going to run out of time.  Yeah, we're running out of time.  But basically, just a real quick setup for the new listeners.  She needed money.  We collected the money.  It was a pile on the floor.  She got completely naked.  She put on the Krusty the Clown mask, crawled to the money, and voila, she got the money.  Well, we came up with something for today's $2,000.  Last time we gave you money, how much was it when you were naked crawling?  $700.  Yeah, $700.  Because I sold that something or whatever. 
[03:01:00]  Wait, I'm getting a communique?  Yeah, Than is saying something.  So it's either very necessary information or just sarcastic bullshit.  So for $2,000, we can't just hand it over to you.  No.  We have to entertain these people across America, and we're going to use you to entertain them.  Than, genius on a post-it.  Jesus Christ, Than.  How does it start?  Can you say exploitation?  It was a bright summer day here on the high seas.  It was the worst of times.  Of Than and men. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, Than.  Jesus.  What's this, a three-post-it note?  Urgent communique.  Oh, okay.  All right, can we...  Let me see.  Let me see.  No.  I get it, too.  He's like a little eight-year-old.  I want to see a joke.  That's all.  All right.  Did you have to use the word incredibly when you're writing a quick fucking note?  All right, here we go.  Incredibly.  So we got $2,000 for you, Patty. 
[03:02:00]  Mm-hmm.  Trust me.  We don't want to see it, but it's going to make for a good video clip on the website.  You're going to get completely naked.  Patty, nudity is involved again.  It's $2,000, Patty.  Two grand.  All your problems are washed away.  Here it is.  After a couple minutes of humiliation.  Problem solved.  We got $2,000.  You see how we cleared off the area in front of us?  You're going to be naked in front of us, okay?  Patty, center stage.  Center stage.  Oh, they're pulling the curtain.  Curtain.  We're going to lay the checks in front of you somewhere. 
[03:02:30]  Should we do this on the floor so she has more room to move around?  Yeah, we should do it.  We're going to do it on the floor, okay?  So you have more room to move around.  The checks will be on the floor.  You'll be naked.  You'll also, unfortunately, be blindfolded, Patty.  Patty, you will be blindfolded.  Now, the check will be somewhere down there.  You just have to find it by searching around and trying to find it. 
[03:03:00]  It's like the treasure hunt.  Sounds easy, right?  Okay.  You're just going to be crawling around on the floor trying to find the check that's on the floor.  Easy enough, right?  Yeah.  And that $2,000 will be yours.  You think it'll take a little while as you're blindfolded to find it?  Most likely.  Most likely.  But once you feel a couple of pieces of paper, you know it's the check, and you know you have $2,000.  Yes.  It's that easy, Patty.  I put it in my hoochie-coochie. 
[03:03:30]  No, no, no hoochie-coochie involved.  Does that sound easy enough?  Are you willing to give it a try?  Everybody, she's willing to give it a try.  Woo!  Oh, Patty, Patty, Patty.  There's one thing I forgot to tell you.  Than, why don't you give me that bag?  Jeez.  You know, whenever anybody asks for a Johnny to bring down the little thing, it was always there.  Patty, we have a bag full of these.  What are they?  These are mouse traps.  No! 
[03:04:00]  These are going to be all over the floor.  And as you go to...  What if I get stuck in one?  Well, then you're going to have to move on because that ain't the check.  You got to chew your hand off like a bear.  They break...  Those things break rat's necks.  I know.  Watch this.  Ow!  Ow!  I will admit it hurts like a motherfucker, but I'm fine.  See?  I wouldn't be willing to do anything.  I would be willing to...  You could do it.  I would just...  No, that's bullshit.  Ah, whatever.  That's from his 20 years of putting air conditioners in. 
[03:04:30]  He can't even feel his hands anymore.  He's got those blue-colored calluses.  You couldn't have just gotten the regular ones.  These are Tomcats.  This hurts so bad.  My finger is ready to come off.  That's an industrial rat trap.  That is for New York rats.  Patty, we're going to...  Snap it on your finger.  Finger.  That's not fucking...  That's a badger trap.  Yeah.  That's not fucking Greenwich mice.  That's for dogs.  They catch deer. 
[03:05:00]  Deer.  Oh, they're going to kill poor boy and Patty.  Wait, what do you do?  You don't need to set him.  Oh, man, I don't know.  Do it.  Do your...  I'm not fucking doing it.  Do your whole finger in there.  It's going to hurt.  Yeah, the more meat you get in there,  less it's going to hurt.  Get the meat between your thumb and forefinger.  Do it.  I remember the time you staked yourselves.  Come on, Opie.  Ah!  I remember the time you staked yourselves.  The traps work.  Bill, want to do it? 
[03:05:30]  I got to do it.  All right, let Bill Burr do it.  I got to do it.  Opie, you staked yourself.  Crazy white boy shit.  This is crazy.  I got to know what it feels like.  It's going to make me enjoy it more.  How do you set it?  How do you set it?  Yeah, help him set it before he...  Set it and forget it.  It's middle-aged jackass.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, man, does that hurt.  That leaves a mark.  You're doing the newspaper game with those stupid...  Whatever.  We're just showing you.  If we can do it, you can do it.  You don't think about it. 
[03:06:00]  You just got to do it.  Yeah, let's go.  Yeah.  All right, we got to set these traps.  How many we got, by the way?  What are you doing?  Don't you know how to set a mouse trap?  Here, give it to me.  I'll set it right.  Steve?  What?  Steve is so against traps because once he was caught in one out through the woods of Jersey.  I bet if it was an electric trap, he'd know how to use it.  Nothing?  Nothing?  All right, anything?  You know, Opie, if you got yourself a cat...  Shut up!  You would never have a cat.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  I hear this.  Ah!  You motherfucker! 
[03:06:30]  Woo!  That hurts, man.  That really hurts.  Come on, Patrice.  One time.  Look at him.  Oh, no, Patrice ain't doing it.  You got the big, meaty hands.  It's not going to hurt you.  I'm not an adventurous motherfucker.  It's not going to hurt you.  Why don't next week we wrestle rhinos, motherfucker?  You're comparing rustling rhinos to this?  Dad, fuck you.  That hurts.  I'm not going to call him.  All right.  Patty, what we need you to do is leave the studio.  Where is she going to get naked?  Well, it's got to be in here.  My hand is shaking.  It's got to be... 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, what do you want to do?  What are they saying?  Let her get...  Turn her around.  There's a mic somewhere because I'm picking up somebody.  Let her get up here.  Oh, all right.  Let her get up here and do a little strip tease.  No, I don't want to see that.  Well, you know something, Opie?  Smart.  Smart choice.  The people want to see it.  Oh, okay.  The people want to see it.  All right.  Yeah, we are on Pal Talk.  All right, Patty.  Smart choice.  Give her a little help up.  Give her a boost up.  All right.  Let's see your naked turnip body.  Naked turnip. 
[03:07:30]  I don't have a turnip.  You have a turnip figure.  Do you have any strip music?  Instead of an...  Ugh.  And ladies, come on up.  Come on, fellas.  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up to the stage right now.  You might remember.  Her is one of the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.  Her name is Heather.  Let's give her a big hat as she comes up.  It's a stalker Patty, everybody.  Big hat for stalker Patty.  All right, Patty, can you hear it? 
[03:08:00]  Come on, fellas.  The more you clap, the more she's going to do.  Wow.  No one's clapping.  Big surprise there.  All right, Patty.  Now, in as sexy a fashion as you can, remove your awful clothing.  Yeah, take off your awful clothes. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  Lips and hips.  All right.  She's taking her...  When strippers do it, it's so much sexier.  Oh, she's got a hole in her sock.  Patty's got a hole in her sock, and a big, long toenail is sticking through it.  I was for this.  This is fucking shocking.  Her big, long toenail.  Patty, you should have clipped your toenails.  Yeah.  You should have burned those socks.  All right.  Get rid of the socks.  Are those an actual color? 
[03:09:00]  Those are just dirty white.  I thought those hammer toes were fixed.  They're growing back.  Oh, they came back as wrench toes, monkey wrench toes.  All right.  It's a different tool.  All right, Patty.  Here she goes.  Oh, did you see her pathetically just try to wiggle a little bit as a stripper?  Oh, my God.  What, did the cat scratch you?  Well, I think that's rough.  There we go. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  This is one of these shows, like, when I leave, I feel like I left a part of me here.  Yeah.  A part of my soul is done.  Because you did.  And there.  Oh, she's wearing an Opie and Anthony thong.  Patty, how did you know to wear that thong?  She wears them every day.  I just put it off because it was clean underwear.  Ladies and gentlemen, how old are you, Patty?  She's 50 years old.  Hey, does Oxy make one of those pads for your ass? 
[03:10:00]  Why, what's the matter?  Patty, do a little spin for the crowd here.  All right.  All right.  Well, Patty, you're going to have to do the money shot now.  And the O&A thong has to go.  Here we go.  She can keep that on.  Oh, I'm the bad guy now.  I just said it before you did.  I want to get off.  I want to get off. 
[03:10:30]  Make it stop.  Wow.  You look like you should be in Lord of the Rings.  I'm thinking more Schindler's List.  Oh, my God.  Now, now, don't worry about covering up.  Feel good about yourself.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Are the mousetraps being set?  Are they are?  All right.  She can step down so we get the freaking blindfold on her.  All right.  There we go. 
[03:11:00]  Patty, step down.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, I saw a little not looking, not looking.  Patrice, there it is.  Hi, Patty.  Look, it's the prize in the community, the white woman, naked.  Isn't that the prize?  She'd be pit bull training.  Just in case.  I don't get that.  Just in case you were wondering what Geddy Lee looks like naked.  Is that it? 
[03:11:30]  Fuck that.  Fuck that.  Thank you.  I'm Geddyna.  All right.  We need a blindfold.  All right.  If we can get a blindfold of some.  Oh, who just got nailed with the mousetrap?  One of the interns.  Oh, that hurts like a motherfucker, doesn't it?  Are you okay?  No.  No, man.  I'm pretty fucking far from okay.  Did you see how far that thing fell?  Dude, we're running out of show, believe it or not.  Yeah, we're running out of show.  This, this.  Oh.  Jesus. 
[03:12:00]  All right.  The mousetraps are being set.  Patty needs a blindfold.  Yeah, let's get the blindfold on Patty.  Patty, I hope you are ready for a little bit of pain because those traps hurt really bad.  But I am really bruised here.  Right.  You just can't help not looking right at it.  It really is like a murder scene.  She looks like somebody stuck a firecracker up there.  I think for 50, that's fine.  Yeah, it is. 
[03:12:30]  And it's a virgin, right?  It's a virgin.  And she's a virgin.  She's untouched by a man or woman or anything, as far as I know.  This is like when you're on the subway platform.  A little peanut butter and a cat, but yes.  Are there's a trap set?  It's like when you're on the subway platform, you're just praying for the train to come.  If some homeless person begins to disrobe, you're like, oh, please.  Come on.  Where is it?  Her hymen looks like tapioca.  Untouched hymen that grows old. 
[03:13:00]  It's not even pliable anymore.  It's like stained glass.  Stained glass hymen.  It's petrified.  She has a petrified hymen.  It's like a Lay's potato chip now.  Hymen's like a sack of marbles.  I think this is going to top the Krusty the Clown mask.  Well, Patty, I got to agree with you there.  Jesus Christ, this looks like one of those terrorist videos.  Oh, it does.  It looks like she's going to be killed.  And wouldn't it be better to end that way by just maybe chopping her head off? 
[03:13:30]  But Patty, your head is safe.  Don't worry.  Oh, my God.  Why didn't you bring in one of your swords?  You should have been standing right behind her.  I could have decapitated her.  Make her read a letter.  She's rocking back and forth.  Yeah, make her hold a newspaper.  America is no good.  And you should not be here.  And it's not good.  I want to appeal to my family.  Oh, you got nailed again?  I'm trying to set the traps. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, they're hard.  Please get out of Iraq.  You know, America is...  Remove the troops.  We're being criminals here, and we really should leave.  We've only got five minutes left.  Five minutes.  How many traps are we setting?  About ten.  Oh, shit.  Ten?  I'm getting the checks in place, too.  All right.  The checks are going to be...  Jesus, Opie is hands on, my husband.  You're not putting the checks in the trap, are you?  I'm not playing my hands.  That would be cruel. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, God.  The checks are going in the trap.  All right.  Get Patty over there.  That looks like a field in Vietnam.  The checks are in the trap.  Yeah.  It's the killing field.  Oh, what is it?  That picture of the naked baby running down the shore?  Yeah.  Oh!  After the napalm strike went bad, we hit the village.  That's what Patty looks like.  That little naked Vietnamese girl.  All right.  I'm...  Still got the scars on her back?  Get Patty up against the door.  All right.  I got to go to church.  I'm going to church this week. 
[03:15:00]  I'm going to be the field reporter here.  Oh, this is so bad.  And you could grab my mic over there.  You might have a better view.  All right.  I can see from here.  Get her on all fours.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Patty, here's the deal.  You hear my voice?  Shit.  I do.  All right.  You got to come toward me.  There's ten mousetraps in front of you.  I don't know where you are.  And she allowed to curl her fingers up like that.  Yeah, she could do whatever she wants.  You got to feel around for the checks as you move forward, okay?  Oh, I'm so scared. 
[03:15:30]  Yes, but just think of the wonderful prizes.  You're going to win at the end of this.  $2,000, Patty.  Oh, no.  No, don't do that!  $2,000, Patty.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It was it.  It was it.  It was it. 
[03:16:00]  Okay, that was not the check.  Oh, this is so...  Obviously not.  It's dancing.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Feel around for the check, Patty.  You're almost there.  $2,000 on the...  Oh, my God.  That hit me.  My finger.  That's what it's supposed to do.  Hey, if you were a mouse, you'd be dead.  Come on.  Keep crawling. 
[03:16:30]  Come on, old mouse.  Do you think mice get $2,000 at the end of this?  They don't.  By the way, if you don't find the checks by the end of the show,  then they stay on the floor until tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  That was the back of the hand.  Oh, my God.  It just got the palm of my hand.  She's going to have to give the teller the check with her mouth.  You're mean.  You're mean.  Patty, we're running out of show.  Come on, Patty.  Running out of show.  All your problems could go away.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[03:17:00]  I built a piece of paper.  Do I have a check?  I think I do.  You just got $1,000.  Yeah, there it is.  One check, one check, one to go.  One to go.  $1,000.  Oh!  Ow!  Ow!  It's my palm, my knuckles.  Ah!  It's my fingers, my palm, my knuckles.  Fuck, man.  I can't even take that.  Oh, my God.  I got my...  How much time, Derek?  Oh, Patty. 
[03:17:30]  A minute 30?  Oh.  Oh, Patty.  I don't know.  Just slap the floor.  Just get it over with.  That's...  Ow!  Did you do that on purpose?  No, no.  We wouldn't do that?  No, none of it.  Oh!  Ow!  Ah!  She just took three.  Three of them.  Ah!  Come on, Opie.  This is not funny.  I'm almost forgetting she's naked.  You pushed that toward me, and you know it!  Ow!  You pushed that toward me.  I know you did. 
[03:18:00]  She thinks she...  Ow!  How much time, Derek?  We got a minute left, Patty.  You gotta find the chick in a minute.  Hey, don't touch me.  This is all being videotaped.  Oh, can you push that toward me, too?  It's all being videotaped, so don't worry.  You'll get to see it online.  I'm starting to recognize this anger.  I'm having a Bernie Getz flashback here.  I feel it.  That's my foot!  Move away from me.  It's back this way, actually.  It's back this way. 
[03:18:30]  What is wrong with this?  Did you find it?  No, she's still looking.  It's behind you, Patty.  I swear.  Ah!  What?  I hope it hurt.  Hurry.  It's 30 seconds left in the show.  It's behind you.  It's behind you.  It's behind you.  Come on.  It's behind you.  Oh, my God.  I found it!  She found it.  Hey!  We have a winner!  It still hurts.  $2,000, Patty.  Congratulations!  Oh, God.  I can walk now. 
[03:19:00]  I calm her.  Holy!  How many were there?  No, once or once.  We reset a few.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  You know, the funny thing is, too...  Here comes the love's dumbest jingle.  At least it's a fucking jingle.  I'll show the world I'm a funny guy.  I'll throw in some sound effects and...  Stop your lines that don't make no sense and... 
[03:19:30]  Hope an aunt will be so proud of me.  Hey!  Epic!  God!  I've missed the point completely.  I should kill myself discreetly.  This jingle wasn't my suicide.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  My life's been kind of rough and...  18 years is long enough.  My dad should've hocked the gun away.  Yay!  I got nothing.  This concludes the worst of Opie and Anthony.
