<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast celebrated their 10th anniversary on New York radio, heavily featuring audio clips from their first day on the air.  Opie and Anthony, along with frequent guest Lil’ Jimmy Norton, reacted to their younger selves, highlighting their initial nervousness and attempts to sound “cool” and “New York,” contrasting it with their current, more abrasive style.  They recounted stories of their interactions with other WNEW personalities like Carol Miller, Dave Herman (who later sued them), Scott Muni, and Tony Pig, embellishing some for comedic effect.  Norton had recently been a guest judge on a Los Angeles "Gong Show" with Ron White and J.B. Smoove.  The hosts discussed their "red alert mode" without elaborating and promoted their "Day in the Garden" concert.  They also commented on Al Sharpton's criticism of Anderson Cooper.  The broadcast included numerous listener calls, further audio clips from their first show, and much profanity and crude jokes, referencing boobies and sexual acts.  Opie fabricated a story about a "hero's welcome," and Anthony joked about running out of quarters at a peep show.  The show highlighted the prevalence of faxes in the past and their early attempts at edgy content, including a traffic report and forced attempts to sound "New York," referencing a video of Anthony hailing a cab in Nazi regalia.  Discussions included the 1992 summer song ("Little Miss Can't Be Wrong"), the weather, new movies, and a promise to play the "Carol Miller tapes" the following day.  Jimmy Norton frequently interjected, pointing out inconsistencies in the old audio.  The hosts also discussed their initial attempts at conforming to station expectations before abandoning that strategy, along with  the initial hostility from established personalities and the subsequent shift in their on-air persona.

The show then announced their "Traveling Virus" comedy show at the PNC Bank Arts Center, featuring Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neill, Bob Kelly, Rich Voss, Otto, George, and a "huge special guest," with $10 lawn tickets on sale the next day.  A significant portion focused on the cancellation of NBC's *To Catch a Predator*, discussing its effectiveness, a suspect's suicide, lawsuits, and dismissed charges.  This led to a heated debate with a caller, Greg, about parental responsibility versus government intervention in preventing child sexual abuse, marked by strong language and accusations.  The hosts played (or attempted to play) a ten-year-old audio clip of Anthony impersonating President Clinton calling from China, which they were prevented from playing due to its "Asian thing" content, sparking discussion about media cowardice.  Several callers weighed in on *To Catch a Predator* and government overreach, particularly from a libertarian perspective.  The broadcast concluded with a news segment mocking a CBS2 report about construction workers drinking on the job.

Further segments included a discussion about a news report depicting construction workers heavily drinking during their lunch break, prompting discussion of media hypocrisy and a riff on the Newfoundland slang term "wobbly pops."  The conversation shifted to Craigslist, prostitution ads, and government regulation of online activity, including mentions of a Cream Pie Jones skit and a "Portrait of a Cold Cum Eater" promo.  A caller inquired about the price of a multilingual prostitute.  Listener-submitted audio and a request for a Chumba Wumba/Bill Clinton parody were also featured. A study about Facebook usage among isolated individuals was mocked.  The show also covered a video titled "Wiener Barbecue," zit-popping videos, a Vern Troyer sex tape, and complaints about the iPhone's keyboard.  The bulk of the remaining time was spent on a "Tomato Audio" man-on-the-street segment, featuring an intern's awkwardly phrased questions about tomatoes, with discussion of the segment's reception and the intern's feelings, and apparent teasing of the intern behind his back.

A considerable portion of the broadcast focused on the intern, Josh, and his tomato-themed "man on the street" segments. The hosts and staff heavily ridiculed Josh's questions, leading to a discussion of his sex life and inexperience, causing him significant discomfort.  Pornography was shown, further distressing Josh.  Another intern, Bob, participated in the teasing.  Accusations were leveled against Sam and Steve for possibly setting Josh up to fail.  Despite Josh's repeated attempts to disengage, the hosts persisted, delving into his personal life.

Further discussion of Josh’s tomato questions dominated a segment, with his questions initially deemed "a steaming pile of horse shit."  The hosts, along with Bob, whose appearance was also discussed at length, heavily insulted Sam, calling him a "smart ass motherfucker," "douchebag," and "asshole."  Josh's questions and demeanor were mocked, along with his appearance and Midwestern politeness.  Numerous profane and humorous "lines of the day" were read.  Carbonite was mentioned during a commercial break.  The hosts reflected on their past behavior, comparing their current attitudes to their actions ten years prior.  The overall tone was highly informal, irreverent, and filled with vulgar language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  The shop show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  Where are you driving to kick somebody out of the house?  No, Rick, I'm driving to a television program where I work here in Hollywood.  Opie and Anthony.  John, where do you work?  I work in Long Island.  I can't really tell you that.  What radio station?  Exactly!  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  I like boobies because I wasn't breastfed as a child.  Aww.  So I hope he keeps E-Rock around.  For a good suckling.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Look who's back.  Lil' Jimmy Norton.  Back from La La Land.  Welcome, Jimmy. 
[00:01:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  877-212-ON-A.  Getting ready for another day of broadcasting.  Got a message to the faithful listeners.  We got the casual listeners.  This message really isn't for you.  You guys come and go.  You flip around the dial and you're like,  Ah, that was kind of funny, but 
[00:02:00]  now I want to listen to some rock and roll.  Not talking to you guys.  Not the casual listeners.  The faithful listeners.  We want to let the, let the, that's, that's, that's thrown me off, but it's perfect.  We want the faithful listeners to know  that the Opie and Anthony show 
[00:02:30]  is in red alert mode.  Red alert.  We are in red alert mode.  Like I said, this isn't for the casual listener.  This is for the faithful listeners.  What does that mean, red alert mode,  to the faithful listeners, Anthony? 
[00:03:00]  They should be in standby, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, standby.  Get ready to quit your jobs  because we're going to need you.  We want you.  That's all we can say right now, but  the Opie and Anthony show  is in red alert mode.  Yeah.  Red alert mode.  That's simple enough.  Besides that, how are you, Anthony? 
[00:03:30]  Good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doing very well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Jimmy was out there in L.A.  doing the gong show with David Tell.  You were, what, a guest judge?  Yeah, with Ron White and J.B. Smoove.  You guys know J.B.?  Smoove?  I know the name.  Black dude, he's on that car.  Well, I assume.  With Smoove.  Oh, yeah, I don't know why I say he's a black dude.  Like, oh, the Irish kid?  It was funny, man.  Yeah, it was fun.  Ron White's a funny dude, too.  You know, Ron?  Yeah, yes. 
[00:04:00]  He's never done our show, but a very funny guy.  Part of that blue-collar comedy thing, right?  Yeah, he was drinking scotch, and he wanted to smoke a cigar.  And until they have a permit for him to smoke on stage.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  And you need a permit as a performer.  Hold on.  What are you eating?  I had cereal.  I didn't expect you to ask me so soon.  I got nervous.  Well, we're excited.  You're back.  And so Ron wanted to smoke a cigar, because he smokes a cigar. 
[00:04:30]  They wouldn't let him.  The fire marshal was busting everybody's balls about it.  And so he was really bummed out.  And then there was one of those who got a pogo stick who set his pogo stick on fire as part  of his act.  And he said, why did he do that?  But I can't smoke it.  Yeah, right?  He was really unhappy.  He was like, it's amazing what babies are.  I mean, I don't like cigarettes smoke.  This is a cigar.  He's a performer.  He's in the context of performance.  Leave him alone.  Yeah, that is the truth.  They're getting crazy with that whole smoking thing.  It just stinks.  I don't even think you're allowed to smoke outside anymore. 
[00:05:00]  And I'm not a big fan of the cigarette.  There's a lot of places outside you can't smoke.  But leave these guys alone, please.  Don't let them smoke outside.  You buy new condos a lot of times now you can't?  Right.  Because in a contract, there's no smoking in the condo?  Yeah, so that's supposed to be your own place.  What I find funny is they don't let you smoke outside.  But, you know, cars are just flying by.  I think what they're giving off is a little worse than a cigarette.  Yeah.  In the long run.  But anyway.  Let's say hi to Brian in Virginia. 
[00:05:30]  People are trying to figure out what red alert mode means.  How are you, Brian?  Phenomenal.  Well, welcome back.  Me.  Hey, I was wondering, does this red alert mean that the black man is taking over?  What?  The black man is taking over?  What the hell does that mean?  My God, sir.  No.  Taking over.  All we can say is we're in red alert mode.  And hopefully we'll have more info as the days go on here. 
[00:06:00]  Right?  Absolutely.  But we just need to be alert and ready to go.  Yeah.  We need to look out for our own interests.  Oh, my God.  I wish I could say more because it's a doozy.  It is a doozy.  Also, we're celebrating 10 years in New York radio.  10 years ago, I guess.  Today, huh?  Well, we thought the listeners know more than we do because we thought it was the 10-year 
[00:06:30]  anniversary was tomorrow.  But we found out the 10-year anniversary was pretty much yesterday when we were teasing  that it's going to be Friday.  The listeners actually know more than we do.  Right, E-Rock?  Yeah.  It was yesterday.  The tapes that we have are labeled the 26th and the 27th of 98, but that would be a Friday  and Saturday.  And you guys started on a Thursday.  So it was the 25th and the 26th of 98, which was yesterday. 
[00:07:00]  Does it really matter a day off?  Well, it kind of does.  Or one day or another if you're celebrating that.  Yeah?  If you're celebrating 10 years, it kind of does.  Yeah.  Like three years, five.  Wasn't there a leap year this year?  Oh, okay.  So now we're fine.  Oh, you think?  They threw an extra day in.  Well, what's funny, though, is we started in New York radio 10 years ago.  And we're probably two days off.  But we've only done seven years, nine months of radio.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  So let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Hey there, Rob.  We don't want to break that down into how much of it was quality.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Rob.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  So are we going to have to, are all the listeners going to have to wait like another two years  to be entertained by ONA?  Is that what you guys are trying to like secretly tell us?  Nope.  Okay, good.  Nope.  Okay.  I wish I could say more, but we feel that we need to be in red alert mode.  That's all I'm saying for now. 
[00:08:00]  For now.  We need to hunker down.  Not go to the mattresses.  No.  But get ready to just hunker down.  We need to keep our eyes open.  You think?  Yeah.  Eyes, ears.  We need to look at, assess situations.  Things like that.  Yeah.  That's all.  Yeah.  No need to completely panic.  Let's just put it this way.  Nah, I'm not going to say that because that's...  Yeah.  Let's not put it anyway. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  Let's just leave it lie.  But Iraq had a funny line, but I can't...  No, he didn't.  He really did.  Did he?  Yeah.  What was it?  Nah, then people would really...  The speculation would be that.  Turn that on.  Iraq points to the blank monitor every morning.  Yeah.  He goes, check this out, and points to a blank monitor.  This is my brain.  Oh.  Okay.  See, that's a funny line, but...  That is, yeah.  Then that might throw people off, so...  Yeah.  Ah, let's say hi to Steve in Philly. 
[00:09:00]  Steve.  Hey, guys.  Anthony said it's just an anniversary date.  Hey, was that the same when you were in divorce court?  They do remember everything.  That's when I was asked by my ex-wife's lawyer when my anniversary was, when the date I got  married was, and I told him, I don't remember.  Which is beautiful.  Because I always get March 19th and May 19th confused, because March 19th is Swallow's Day.  Very important when I was living in San Juan Capistrano. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Big party, the whole week, and it culminates on March 19th, and a big parade and everything  that I used to ride my horse in, and so I remember that.  And my anniversary was May 19th.  So I got tripped up, and it took me a little while, so I'm sitting there on the stand, just  I'm folding under questioning.  Hendry.  I couldn't remember which was which.  One day you celebrate the Swallows, and the other day you're celebrating one who doesn't. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Oh.  Very good.  All right, where do you want to begin?  I mean, we do have audio from our first New York show from 10 years ago.  There you go.  Really?  Uh-oh.  See, Jimmy's excited because Jimmy wasn't part of our first radio show in New York City 10  years ago.  Let me think about this for a second.  Yeah.  It's not like we went from Boston radio, where we played our clips and cringed at some of the 
[00:10:30]  things we did, and came to New York and all of a sudden became great.  This is probably going to be more over-happy, crappy.  I just want to hear a little, it's your first day in New York, you're probably very excited.  You guys are great at that.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yeah, I know.  You're probably right.  Some people say that we were never better than our WNEW days.  So I'm saying the first day probably was just, you know what I mean?  Shut up, Jimmy. 
[00:11:00]  No, I'm actually serious.  No, you're actually not.  I really am.  Look, the NAW days were great.  This show was before iPods, before satellite radio.  Yeah.  Some people were still married.  This was all they had.  Oh, oof.  All right.  Well, I certainly was happy to be there.  I was happy to be anywhere but home.  Well, let me just hear what this is.  Good afternoon.  Hey, what's up, bro?  All right, listen.  We're going to...  No. 
[00:11:30]  What's up, bro?  Was that you?  I don't know.  What was this?  Let me hear that.  Good afternoon.  Hey, what's up, bro?  Maybe it was on purpose.  They were pumping in, I remember, helium.  Yeah.  Into the studio at the time.  Phone line, if you want to talk to us live.  Be kind, please.  Dude, what's with your voice?  Shut up.  Shut up.  He just...  That was the longest delay before you just... 
[00:12:00]  You were trying to think of something, and then you just told me to shut up, ass.  Because I'm in shock.  Yasker's Farm, man.  Yasker's Farm, yeah.  Don't eat the brown acid.  I can't do this.  So...  What happened?  I thought we ruled.  I always think we rule until we play things back. 
[00:12:30]  Then I realize we sucked.  Well, we do play a lot of stuff in the NAW days,  and no one could really tell the difference,  but wow.  This was pretty much our first day in New York radio,  New York City radio, 10 years ago, yesterday.  I don't know if I could do this, man.  All you were was probably,  I'm guessing that you probably knew you were going to get killed  because you were on a music station,  and then people were going to start screaming for music.  I don't know, maybe this is not...  Oh, I don't even care.  I said, be kind.  It's just how I said it that I have a problem with. 
[00:13:00]  Be kind, man.  Look, I'm being uber cool  because I'm really nervous.  All right, 10 years ago,  yesterday, we started with this.  The Rock of New York.  That's the latest from the Goo Goo Dolls,  Iris, off the City of Angels soundtrack.  Good afternoon.  Hey, what's up, bro?  How you doing, O?  Not much.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:13:30]  Who cares that you asked what he didn't...  You answered a question Anthony didn't even ask.  Anthony goes, how you doing, bro?  And you went, not much.  That's true.  You picked that up, huh?  Not much.  How you doing?  Not much.  What time is it?  Over easy.  What's going on?  Good.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  These were the days when we used to get nervous. 
[00:14:00]  This is the first...  Break.  This is our first, absolute first break in New York.  New York City, yes.  Okay.  10 years ago, yes.  All right.  Then I could deal with that.  That's a little nerve-wracking.  Well, then don't look at the phone lines  and don't look at instant feedback  if you think you could deal with this.  Oh, God.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And we're back in New York.  Here we are.  That's right.  This is good.  92 degrees in New York today.  Not much oxygen out there  on the streets of New York either. 
[00:14:30]  Nothing.  The hell?  I'm doing weather?  You're doing weather.  What am I doing?  And I'm doing smooth jazz.  Smooth jazz.  We're just out of...  Smooth jazz.  Not much oxygen out there.  Later, I do traffic?  Yes.  Really?  And I'm serious?  Uh, no.  Oh, okay.  Oh, my God.  I guess it's kind of a goof.  It's in New York either.  Nothing smells quite like Manhattan  on a 92-degree day. 
[00:15:00]  It's the sense...  Because when we left,  I think it was wintertime.  Yes.  And that was the last time I was in.  Right.  And the cold weather  kind of covers up the fragrance  of stacked garbage.  Uh, some of those corners,  those dark hit-away corners  that some people are using  as bathrooms.  Yeah.  That, there's a bouquet  that just kind of floats off  of the stoops and stairways.  But you know something?  You gotta love it, right?  Yeah, it's New York.  You know you're in New York. 
[00:15:30]  That's true.  Oh, I gotta, I gotta tell you.  Oh, no, I don't have to tell you nothing.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was really...  Yeah, someone was suggesting,  Jared in Boston,  Hey, Ope, play Misty for me.  Oh, I brought in some of my poetry today.  Uh, sorry, I can't go out tonight.  I have to write poetry for my show.  Yeah, I got a lot of writing to do tonight.  Pick out records and...  If you want to hear a song,  877-212-0-N-A.  You were, you were smooth, 
[00:16:00]  giving the smooth jazz delivery.  Did we just do a break  on the smells of New York City?  Yeah, I'm...  Gibbs of crap.  Once again, I'm just trying too hard.  I'm trying too hard.  I mean, I hate to defend this,  but it's your first day in New York.  It's not that bad.  It's like your first day in New York.  It's not like you guys are over the top.  You're just like trying to not...  You're trying to just not screw up.  We're trying to survive.  Yeah.  Knowing a lot of, uh,  a lot of bigwigs  are listening to our first show. 
[00:16:30]  Except for not exactly  listening to each other.  Well, so how are you?  Uh, Tuesday.  All right.  Tuesday.  Yeah, we're not listening to each other.  We're just trying to blurt stuff out.  Just keep the talk moving along.  Chatter, chatter, chatter.  Who cares what it is?  There are a lot of  humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a-humm-a.  Oh.  Well, I gotta tell you something.  Boy, I can't wait.  What did I...  Yeah, what did you have to tell me?  What did I think was important  that I needed to tell all of New York? 
[00:17:00]  Something you gotta love it, right?  Yeah, it's New York.  You know you're in New York.  That's true.  Oh, I gotta, I gotta tell you.  I gotta, uh, say hi to everyone  I met in Central Park last night.  I've been spending the last two weeks  rollerblading in the park.  And, um...  Man, so many nice people out there.  Oh.  That is such BS!  I didn't talk to anybody!  Man, there's so many nice people out there.  I gotta tell you.  You know, what you've heard about New York  is just not true, man.  Everyone's cool.  What is...  I wish you would've skated  into Tippy Tom. 
[00:17:30]  That would've cured you of your...  Hey, such nice people.  Look, I'll take you back.  I didn't talk to anybody  in Central Park.  I was making it up.  And of course you didn't.  I was trying to relate.  That's what it is.  I was trying to be part of New York.  See, we're trying too hard  to, on day one,  on minute three,  we're trying too hard  to be a part of New York already.  Like, I'm walking around Central Park  just introducing myself  and talking to people.  No one talks to each other  in this city.  We were two returning  Long Island douches 
[00:18:00]  trying to sound like  we're city savvy.  Yeah, make it believe  we're returning back  to New York City.  To New York City.  Meanwhile, you know...  Yeah, we're like,  it's good to be back.  We were never in New York.  No.  We were out in Babylon  and living in Centerport  and Huntington.  And that wasn't,  that wasn't,  that wasn't,  I'm introducing myself.  That was almost like  there's a little buzz  about us coming back on  in Central Park.  And people have been  kind of coming up.  Hey, people coming up 
[00:18:30]  talking.  You know, nice people.  You know.  I wish someone would have  put a cobblestone  over your head.  Big hi to everybody  I met in Central Park.  Yeah, yeah, you know.  This guy behind the tree  waving their hogs at me.  There was that gang  wilding on that jogger.  Just nice people.  How much do I need  to be loved?  We are just relating, Oaf.  Two weeks,  rollerblading in the park.  And man,  so many nice people out there.  But I am serious.  What part of you  blading?  Dude, 
[00:19:00]  when did I decide  to be a dick?  Who is this guy?  Oh, God.  It's awful.  Man,  so many nice people.  Man,  let me tell you.  Let me tell you,  so many nice people.  I am serious.  What part of you  blading?  Dude,  the mayor has cleaned up  the park.  It's a fun place now.  Herr Giuliani  has done a fine job.  You're right.  Yes,  but it kind of sucked  last night.  We're around 72nd Street  and we got stuck 
[00:19:30]  behind some road races.  I wish I knew this  going into the park  last night.  I saw that.  I saw a bunch of people  with numbers.  Right.  Like as if they were  running a race or something.  It was like some kind  of corporate challenge.  So I'm hanging out  with some of my  rollerblading buds  that I've met so far.  Oh,  I don't have.  I don't have  rollerblading buds.  Who did you have?  Who are you hanging  out with?  No,  I was making this up.  We were in New York  for four days  before our first show  and I'm making believe  I've been back  in my penthouse apartment  hanging out 
[00:20:00]  with my old pals.  They're rollerblading buds.  I didn't have  rollerblading buds.  Of course you didn't.  I nodded to one guy  once in all the years  I've skated in the park.  What am I doing?  Yeah,  we were living  in a hotel.  Right.  We make it sound  like we were  hanging out in New York  for weeks  or a month  before our first show.  I'm telling you.  I was making  rollerblading buds.  Yeah,  I got to tell you.  The voice is  what's killing me.  It's not even like  the old AF. 
[00:20:30]  Hey,  how you doing voice?  Yeah.  You tamed it down  a bit.  Yeah,  well.  You were being like  cool.  It was the legendary  WNEW,  so you had to  have that delivery,  I guess.  We knew everybody  was watching  or listening.  I like the way  I like the rollerblading buds  because it makes you sound  like that gang  from the Warriors.  Bunch of guys  in Yankee uniforms  with bats  right into the park  and hitting people. 
[00:21:00]  Alright,  let's get back to this.  It was like  some kind of  corporate challenge,  so I'm hanging out  with some of my  rollerblading buds  that I've met so far,  right?  And this race goes by  and I'm like,  this sucks.  How long is this  going to take  before we can  start skating again,  you know?  And then I look closer  and I'm like,  wait,  there's no women racing.  It's all guys.  They're like,  this really sucks.  So that race goes by  and then I start  skating again  and five minutes later,  yeah,  baby,  free fun in New York City. 
[00:21:30]  All of a sudden  it's another race  but it's all women.  Oh,  that's good.  There's nothing better  than watching women run.  Really?  Nothing better?  Why?  Because their boobies  bounce up and down,  you hack?  By the way,  I just want to  get this in.  Scattered thunderstorms  today,  high of 84.  Currently it's partly  cloudy and 73.  Oh my God,  am I trying  way too hard? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah,  yeah.  Watching women run.  All right?  So we're checking it out  and we're at one  of the water stations.  True story.  Only in New York.  All of a sudden  there's a city worker  with one of those  city hoses.  Right.  And you know  the first part  of a road race,  it's all the really  good runners and stuff  and they're going  and going and going.  Back of the pack  is kind of the people  that just want to,  you know,  run to run,  right?  The guy like  in the gorilla suit  trying to make a statement.  Sure,  all that.  But this was  the ladies race.  The guy with the hose  turned it into  a wet t-shirt contest.  Jesus.  So me and a bunch 
[00:22:30]  of guys on the side  are like,  yes,  this is so much better  than going to one  of those damn  theme restaurants,  you know?  You're making so many  friends.  Me and a few guys  on the side,  you're talking to everybody.  I'm just a dobbling ass  just making friends  as I go.  Runaround Park Eddie  is saying,  this is the douche  and chill show.  Very funny.  You're just tuning in  and we're listening  to our first show  in New York City  ten years ago  yesterday. 
[00:23:00]  Damn theme restaurants,  you know?  I have to start getting  a little more athletic.  Yeah, well,  me and aunt have been  in hotels  for the last two weeks.  I leave my hotel  and aunt doesn't.  I sit in front  of the computer,  yeah.  Right.  I'll get out.  I'll get out more.  You got it.  There's so much going on  in the streets of New York.  Yeah.  All right,  well, we're here.  We're warming up.  If you want to get a hold  of us,  the fax numbers  by Nivest,  VWNEW.  Phone line,  if you want to talk  to us live,  be kind, please.  212-10-VWNEW 
[00:23:30]  where rock lives.  That's the problem.  It was hard to understand  the fun of it.  Yeah, it was backwards.  Backwards.  Why don't we, like,  block out the number?  Who gives a crap?  I don't think they exist  to go over there anymore.  Call us up at  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  How many songs  did you guys get to play  when you did that?  How much?  Hopefully 12.  Hopefully 12 an hour.  Wow. 
[00:24:00]  Stinkeroo.  Two weeks.  You even said  we were in New York  for two weeks.  Before our first show,  that just is not true.  And we were trying  so hard to be  part of New York's  the ambiance of New York.  We'll just hit  making all these friends.  I'm in the park,  me and my rollerblading buds,  there's chicks running by  with water on their breasts.  It's lonesy, folks.  You're talking to  the other guys about it.  Just relating to the guy.  Oops, nudging a guy  with his elbow.  Hey, hey, look at this.  And he's like, 
[00:24:30]  yeah, what are you doing  for dinner tonight?  We'll go out.  Nice bazongas, I'll say.  I'm sweating.  Ugh.  Oh, my God.  Yes, E-Rock,  you had something?  Yeah, you guys  signed on  a little after 3.10.  And it's because  you had songs  to play from the top  of the hour  before you actually came on.  Oh, we came out  of some music, man.  Ah.  All right, we got  a few more clips  from our first show  in New York City  10 years ago yesterday.  10 years ago yesterday. 
[00:25:00]  And we're going to do  some new stuff today,  obviously.  877-212-O&A.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out  the Opie and Anthony show.  877-212-O&A.  We've learned a lot  in the last 10 years,  that's for sure.  Oof.  We also want to let  the faithful listeners know,  not the casual listeners,  we know you're out there.  You catch a couple minutes here,  a couple minutes there,  but you don't really want  to dedicate yourself 
[00:25:30]  to this radio show.  I understand that.  It's just how it works  in the radio world.  But you're out there  listening from time to time.  But for the faithful listeners,  we are in red alert mode.  And that's all we can say  right now.  Red alert mode.  Yeah.  I'll put the shields up.  Hopefully we'll have more  on that later today  or tomorrow.  This is Al Sharpton?  Al Sharpton says  Anderson Cooper's going to hell 
[00:26:00]  for being gay?  Pretty much.  In a roundabout,  like he tried to just brush it off  like a whatever kind of comment,  but that's what he meant.  When did he say it?  It was last night.  Wow.  If he's going to get all up  on Imus' case  about what he had said,  this is probably  ten times worse,  if not even more.  Was he in front of  a predominantly black crowd?  Usually that's when...  No, this was on his show.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, this was on...  On his radio show?  No, no, on Cooper's show. 
[00:26:30]  On Cooper's show.  All right, hold on.  Cooper?  Jesus.  They were discussing  the Ralph Nader comments.  They had a panel  of two black commentators  and one white commentator  talking about the Nader thing  and what he said about Obama.  Obama's talking white?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Not addressing urban issues  to seem, you know,  more white.  That's what Ralph Nader said.  And this is what Al Sharpton  had to say last night?  Mm-hmm.  Reverend Sharpton,  do you agree with that  that that's what Dr. Dobson  may be afraid of?  I think that there seems 
[00:27:00]  to be a fear of dialogue,  and I think rather than  talking at each other  if they talk to each other,  I think the question is  I agree with Tony  about public policy,  but when we talk  about public policy,  I think Senator Obama's right.  None of us leave  our personal convictions  or religious feelings  at the door,  but we also respect the fact  that everyone doesn't have  to have those same convictions  in the public marketplace.  So I may have  some very conservative  personal feelings,  but I feel you have 
[00:27:30]  the right to live  your life differently.  I might think  what you do,  Anderson,  is going to put you  in hell,  but I'm going to defend  your right to get there.  So I think that  that's where I differ  with some of my other brothers.  I'm going to try  and keep you from going there.  Well, I am too,  but there's a difference  in forcing them  to heaven, Tony,  and legislating them  in heaven  and converting them.  Or leading them to heaven.  Let me convert them, Tony.  I appreciate both  of your concerns  about my afterlife.  I'm personally  not all that concerned,  but that's another,  a whole other discussion.  Cooper was visibly, 
[00:28:00]  he was like visibly flustered.  Yeah, he sounded it.  I mean, that's basically  what Sharpton was saying  without really saying it,  but he was trying to,  he was basically  calling him out.  Yeah, but he was also,  he seemed like he might have  been just trying  to be funny too,  like, but that's one  that won't get him  in trouble.  Nah, not at all.  I don't think being gay  was mentioned at all  or if he said something  about like,  we know what you do,  anything that would have  implied something  under the table.  I think he's smart  in that respect  where he knows  how to say things  and get away with it  and I think that's 
[00:28:30]  exactly what he did  just there.  But I mean,  maybe that's what  he was thinking  deep down,  but look at all,  look at all of us  who were just  chomping at the bit.  Oh, we finally got out.  I know.  Here it is.  It is making,  we really do want  to nail Fatso  to the wall.  Who doesn't?  Because he's a hypocrite.  He just hasn't,  you know,  done anything over the top  where we could  really exploit yet.  Because, oh,  we know he's watching us.  Well, guess what, Al?  We're watching you, too.  Yeah.  You want to get back  to the N.E.W. tapes? 
[00:29:00]  Sure.  Jimmy does.  You bet I do.  So 10 years ago yesterday  we started in New York City radio  and listening to our first show  at W.N.E.W.,  wow.  It's quite different  than what we're doing today.  It's painful.  And a lot of people out there  think we were never better  than our W.N.E.W. days.  Well, of course, weren't we?  I think we needed  like the first  three to six months  to kind of warm up.  And then I think  we found our voices.  I got to defend us 
[00:29:30]  because this is just  horrible to listen to.  Do we?  And then there was  no looking back  after that point.  But the first show  we were just so nice  and just happy  to be there.  It's...  Trying to be accommodating  to everyone around us.  It's just awful  to have to listen to.  It really is.  Not for Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy loves it.  It's not bad, actually.  It's not...  The first Dice appearance.  The first time  Anthony did Dice  in New York City radio. 
[00:30:00]  Doesn't really sound  much like Dice.  Ten years ago...  What happened?  Yesterday,  this went down.  You're unbelievable.  Oh.  Oh.  The rock of New York  EMF and unbelievable.  With a little guest  from Dice in there.  When it used to be  relevant, O.B.  That's when I used  to be a star.  That's the...  I could get into  a club and  and knock him dead, O.B.  Yeah, what happened  to you, Dice?  I don't know.  Now I don't even  get through the jokes  no more. 
[00:30:30]  I go,  hickory dickory duck.  Dig-ba-ge-ge-ge-ge.  You know,  last time I saw Dice,  that's what he did.  He doesn't even  do his act anymore.  No, he doesn't.  He just kind of  starts it off  and figures everyone  knows it,  so why bother?  So I'm online  with this chick  in the bank  and I...  Wait a minute.  Wasn't there  more to that Dice?  Yeah, exactly.  I'm smoking a cigarette.  This chick comes up  to me and I say...  A what?  Yeah.  What, Dice?  It's really not  that bad. 
[00:31:00]  No, it's fine.  We said about  20 minutes ago  that there's a break  in here where  Anthony's doing traffic.  Yeah.  We'll get to that  a little later this morning,  but Kevin has something  to say about that.  Kevin in Connecticut,  what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey, man.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Anthony, you've come  full circle, my friend.  You started off  doing the traffic  and now you're dating  a hot girl in New York  doing the traffic.  Oh, look at that.  See, you always...  You always had a thing  for traffic, Anthony.  Yeah, something about  that traffic  just got me, I guess. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  All right, thank you, Kevin.  And what's kind of  interesting about  Anthony doing Dice,  that became a regular thing.  Club Soda Kenny  heard that.  Yep.  And told the real Dice  that there's someone  in New York  doing a very good  impression of Dice  and then Dice  finally came on our show  and, you know,  we had a pretty good  relationship with the guy  over the years.  All right,  another break  from 10 years ago.  Anthony and I,  first show,  New York City Radio  at WNEW.  Good afternoon, 
[00:32:00]  it's Opie and Anthony.  Hola.  Getting lots and lots  of phone calls  from all our old pals.  This is kind of neat.  It's like a homecoming,  huh?  It certainly is.  No one was calling us.  Lots and lots  of phone calls.  Absolutely no one  was calling us.  We were trying to make  believe that we used  to do New York City Radio,  got kicked out,  and now we're back.  No one cared.  We were just two new  douches on the radio.  Douches.  Acting like we were 
[00:32:30]  returning heroes.  Oh, I don't, um...  The people that knew  we were moving back  to the New York area  were our family and friends.  Yeah.  And we were getting  those phone calls  at our houses  or in our hotel rooms.  Yeah, that's it.  But no one was calling  the radio station  saying welcome back.  No.  We were never there.  Homecoming, huh?  It certainly is.  And faxes.  Also, yeah,  speaking of faxes,  I want to say hi  to Vince Skelson.  He faxed and a welcome.  He faxed us a welcome 
[00:33:00]  to NEW.  Best wishes.  That is so cool.  It's not cool.  He hated us.  Vince Skelson,  the rest of them,  hated us.  Could not stand us.  And we hated them back.  The only one we didn't hate  was Scott Muni.  Yeah.  Who was a class act  right to the end.  But the rest of these guys,  they hated us.  They used to hang faxes  in the studio  saying, you know,  from listeners  that just did not like us,  didn't want us on WNEW.  So these guys, 
[00:33:30]  instead of reading the faxes  and maybe throwing them away,  they actually,  and this is a true story,  Stunt Brain,  they would hang them  around the studio.  So when we came in,  we would have to see  these faxes  hanging there.  They were a bunch  of douches.  Douches.  That is so cool.  It's so weird to be here  because, I mean,  just like everyone  in New York,  I grew up listening  to N.E.W.  Legendary station.  By the way,  that's not true.  No.  I'm just calling it 
[00:34:00]  how I see it.  I didn't listen to N.E.W.  They were too eclectic  for me.  Bunch of liars.  We're just lying.  I listened to  Long Island rock stations  growing up.  And I listened to  talk shows.  I listened to a lot  of talk shows  growing up.  It's not true.  This is not true.  You're making it look  like you were just  like with your chin  propped up in your hands  staring at the radio  and now you're  local boy made good.  Yeah.  Local boy made good.  I listened to  PLJ growing up. 
[00:34:30]  They were like  a rock station  back then.  I grew up  listening to N.E.W.  Legendary station.  And just to be  walking around  in these hallways  the last two weeks  and hanging out  with Scott Muni  and Carol Miller.  It's just been  surreal.  Scott's got some  cool stories  he just doesn't  tell on the air.  No.  And I'm not going  to take the liberty  of telling these stories.  Why wouldn't I?  Yeah, why would you add?  Why would I do that?  Why would I add  something interesting  to the show? 
[00:35:00]  I love the tease  with no payoff.  Wow, we're hearing  unbelievable stories  in these hallways.  It's great.  But you know what?  We can't say them  on the air.  Oh, you ought to hear them.  That would be crazy.  Well, you just, you know,  like you put it well  like a dyed-in-the-wool  New Yorker.  You're like,  I don't want to take  liberty of saying that.  You don't want  to take liberties.  Why take liberties?  Now someone tells us  a story in the hall  we can't wait  to get on.  We'll push people  out of the way  to turn the mics on. 
[00:35:30]  Don't tell anyone,  but they found a polyp.  Oh my God,  get us on the air.  Guess whose job  is going to be open soon.  We wouldn't even hesitate.  Back then,  oh, we're hearing  all sorts of crazy stuff,  but it's not our place,  guys,  to tell these stories.  Oh my God.  We stink.  Take liberties.  In the air?  No.  And I'm not going  to take the liberty  of telling these stories.  Right.  Maybe one day  we'll get him in here  and he'll loosen up 
[00:36:00]  and tell them.  We would love to hear  some of those stories.  Oh my God.  His Keith Moon story  is priceless.  So priceless  that you're not  going to hear it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why tell it?  I don't even remember  what it is.  I don't think  it was that big anyway.  I think they were  just hanging out  drinking whiskey  in his office.  I really don't remember.  Ooh.  I don't remember,  but it's not like  they're out banging broads  and getting into fights.  You didn't want  to take liberties  and his story  was priceless.  The two of you,  you should have  charm bracelets  on your wrists 
[00:36:30]  with grandchildren  on them.  Yeah, yeah.  We're just like  two old yentas,  old grandmothers  just talking  about nothing.  Who was listening  to this crap?  His Keith Moon story  is priceless.  Yeah.  Truly priceless.  It could be no price  put on it.  It's been fun so far.  We'll keep it going.  It certainly has.  It certainly has.  It certainly has.  It certainly has.  It will keep it going.  It's been so much fun.  How about we move 
[00:37:00]  on to other stuff?  A little more.  It's an anniversary.  Jimmy sucks.  Ten years ago, Jimmy.  Ten years.  I want to make sure  people know that.  Ten years ago,  we sounded like this.  Also, did you hear  about this a day  in the garden?  Yeah, what's going on here?  This is going to be  very, very...  Well, I guess you  haven't heard  because you said,  yeah, what's going on here?  What's going on here?  In other words,  I know exactly  what this is,  but, oh, hey,  what's going on? 
[00:37:30]  You tell everybody  because we're just talking,  me and you.  There's no audience  out there.  It's just trying  to get the info  out there to everybody.  You hear about this  day in the garden?  Yeah, yeah.  What is that?  Well, it's a hacky concert  they put together.  A hacky concert.  That we had to promote  the hell out of.  El Stinko.  What's going on here?  This is going to be  very, very cool.  It's a two-day  musical music festival  up there in that  damn farm  where it all started.  Yasgur's Farm, man!  Yasgur's Farm, yeah.  Don't eat the brown acid. 
[00:38:00]  This year it's going to be  don't eat the brown Viagra.  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  No!  Ah!  Ah, did you see that jerk?  Oh, good Lord.  Ah!  And a man in my position  can't afford to be made  to look ridiculous.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:38:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  We're takes for nothing.  My new favorite thing  to pile on.  Yeah, the sound effect  pile on.  Yeah, let me tell you people.  Don't take that brown Viagra.  Hey, I sold it, though.  You certainly did.  I was very confident. 
[00:39:00]  Don't eat the brown Viagra.  Times have changed, you know.  But two days outdoors  and Friday, August 14th.  Fine lineup.  Don Henley, Stevie Nicks,  Ziggy Marley  and ten years after.  And then on Saturday...  What is fine about that lineup?  That's a fine lineup, O.  I gotta hear that  fine lineup again.  Oh, that is a fine lineup.  Wait, let me...  Two days outdoors  and Friday, August 14th.  Fine lineup.  Don Henley, Stevie Nicks,  Ziggy Marley  and ten years after.  Oof. 
[00:39:30]  Ten years after had one hit.  Ten years after.  Ziggy Marley  never really made it.  Stevie Nicks is now.  Stevie Nicks.  Even ten years ago  was old and fat.  Oh, God.  This is a fine lineup.  Don Henley, don't forget.  This is...  Yeah, well...  Rockin'.  Don Henley.  Oof.  Wow.  It's a fine lineup.  Wow.  There's only four bands  you mentioned  over two days.  Yeah.  I know it's funny.  We came from AF in Boston  and we were like playing  Metallica, Nirvana, 
[00:40:00]  Disturbed,  Rage Against the Machine  and now we're selling  a ten years after concert  like it's...  Like it's...  You know,  Kurt Cobain's last show.  Stevie Nicks,  Ziggy Marley  and ten years after  and then on Saturday  Pete Townsend,  Joni Mitchell,  Lou Reed,  Richie Havens.  Freedom!  I love the Woodstock movie  to this day.  I bet Richie Haven...  You know what?  I've never seen  the Woodstock movie.  You are just full of...  You're a liar. 
[00:40:30]  You're just a liar.  To this day,  I think I've seen  parts of it once.  But you love it.  Yeah,  it's one of my favorites  to this day.  You're just...  You're just full of crap.  I just wanted to be light.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No,  I don't give a crap.  Freedom!  I love the Woodstock movie  to this day.  I bet Richie Haven  still has the same guitar.  The one with the hole in it  from the Woodstock movie. 
[00:41:00]  I said right  because I don't even know  what you're talking about.  I'll be honest.  Yeah, right.  And let's go for...  If he does have it,  now what?  Well, yeah, really.  Who cares?  What do you care  about his dumb guitar  with a hole in it?  Oh, I don't know.  Who's enjoying  that driving?  I bet he does  have the same guitar.  Funny,  I was thinking that...  You're a liar!  You're a liar!  Yeah,  I'll just play that clip  every time I'm lying. 
[00:41:30]  Goddamn liar!  That's what I play now.  Still has the same guitar.  The one with the hole in it  from the Woodstock movie.  Goddamn liar!  He puts his Viagra in there.  Oh, no.  You didn't go for it twice.  I had to go to the Viagra  because, you know,  it worked so well  the first time.  That's New York.  You do callbacks.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Jimmy is the worst.  He's just this  pandering ass.  Viagra in there.  But tickets are going  to go on sale  this Saturday morning  at 10 a.m. 
[00:42:00]  And right here on the radio,  we're going to...  I'm laughing.  Oh, I know.  The chuckling  that's going on.  They're going to go on sale  this Saturday morning  at 10 a.m.  And right here on the radio,  we're going to be giving away  tickets to the festival  all weekend long.  Who are we?  It's starting tomorrow, right?  Very good.  Very good.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Is this...  You're a liar!  This is painful.  You know,  I want to, like,  get out of my chair,  walk over to Iraq 
[00:42:30]  and punch him in the face.  Because Iraq writes  Opie's intro  to Dire Straits' song here.  Oh, no.  And then he has to write  in parentheses,  just an odd intro.  What does that mean,  Iraq?  Let's say,  what would you do  if we could hop  in the time machine  and go back  to this exact moment  when this was happening?  A little back  to the future action?  Yeah.  We hop in the DeLorean,  take off,  88 miles an hour, 
[00:43:00]  we go back  10 years ago  and we walk  into the studio  and see  that version  of Opie and Anthony  sitting there.  What do we do?  Well, we'd have to  stop at the hardware store  and get a couple  sledgehammers.  Just come up  behind them.  Oh, yeah.  Because if they see us,  there's a problem.  You could cause  some kind of  a time vortex.  I would grab  my old self  and just shake them  and go,  what are you doing?  Stop lying. 
[00:43:30]  What are you doing?  I'd smack myself  and go,  stop laughing  at everything.  Right.  Everything isn't  that funny.  I would have said,  what are you doing?  You didn't want  this job.  You and Anthony  wanted to work  at K-Rock.  They effed you  at the last moment  so you had to  take this stupid job.  At this awful station.  So that doesn't mean  you have to make believe  you like this crap.  Yeah.  It's not a fine lineup.  We had the weirdest  situation. 
[00:44:00]  We had K-Rock  here in New York  and NEW  both wanting us.  We believe to this day  that Howard had  something to do  with us not  getting afternoons  at K-Rock  at the last moment.  Whatever.  Water under the bridge.  So then we  had to go to NEW  because we wanted  to work in New York City.  Yeah.  And boy,  to that station  you need Viagra.  All right.  Let's hear the  according to E-Rock  the odd intro. 
[00:44:30]  Odd intro.  1027 WNEW  where Rock lives.  Here's Dire Straits.  The walk of life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rock wasn't  wasn't living  at that place.  Dire Straits?  Yeah.  Selling a Dire Straits  song?  All right.  I don't think  anyone wants to  hear any more of that.  Oh.  10 years ago.  So.  I think a bit more  when we come back.  Just for the anniversary. 
[00:45:00]  Celebration.  Yeah, it is a real  celebration.  Yeah, look at all  the balloons.  I'm getting  some pal talkers  saying,  oh my God,  Opie sounds like  E-Rock  when E-Rock  does his  radio guy thing.  Hmm.  We had a good  thing going  up there in  Worcester,  Massachusetts  and then we  kind of threw  all that out  the window  on the way  home or  something  and then we  decided to be  like nice guys.  We already  started being 
[00:45:30]  dicks.  Yeah, what  happened?  We were just  scared.  We were real  like asses  in Massachusetts.  At the end of  our run.  Yeah.  Certainly.  I mean, we were  pretty vicious.  We'd gotten into  battles with just  about every jock up  there.  Yeah.  Destroyed him.  Yeah.  We were nasty.  We were getting  in trouble all  the time for  a lot of  sexual content  and things  like that.  And then we  sit down in  the seats in  New York  and come off 
[00:46:00]  like Jimmy  said to  grandmas.  We should be  knitting.  This is awful.  I guess we  just had to  kind of wait  it out  because we  didn't know  what the  landscape was  whatsoever.  Ugh.  All right.  Tim made  this.  Oh, happy  anniversary.  Happy  anniversary.  Happy  anniversary.  Happy  anniversary.  It's  Opie and  Anthony's  10th  anniversary 
[00:46:30]  celebration.  You got a lot,  right?  Yeah, it's  New York.  You know  you're in  New York.  Let's say  hi to  Sean in  North Carolina.  Sean.  Oh, you  said that  Rock didn't  live at  NAW.  Apparently  neither did  talent.  Oh, Sean.  I miss  Buzz Buckley.  Oh, Sean.  That's just  hurtful.  I'm sorry  I did that.  Mike Jersey.  Hey, I was  going to say 
[00:47:00]  it sounds like  back then  you guys  just, it  was just  like background  music.  Like people  would just  have it on  in the car  and not  really listen.  just as  talking noise  just to hear  some type  of words  coming out  of someone's  mouth.  I think  that's why  the delivery  was like  this because  we wanted  to just  blend in  with everything  else.  Yeah, you  don't have  to.  Please don't  listen to  what I'm  saying because  I know  I'm saying  nothing.  Yeah, don't  listen.  That's what  I'm pretty  much saying  by using  this delivery  that this  part of the 
[00:47:30]  radio show  will be over  soon and  we'll be back  to your music.  Yeah.  You were  bridging a  little bit  trying to  bridge people  from what  they were  used to  into what  you were  doing.  Yeah.  Let's go  to John  in Connecticut.  John.  Hey, I  just tuned  in.  I just  got up.  Sorry, but  is this  the new  show we're  attacking?  These guys  are terrible.  I didn't  get the  number, though.  Let me  call it.  Punch it  out.  All right.  All right.  We'll have  more audio 
[00:48:00]  from our  first show  in New York  City.  What a treat.  10 years ago  yesterday.  Total treat.  Before we go to  break, can I say I was  watching CW11 and Ben  Bailey, our buddy,  was just on?  He's blowing up.  Ben Bailey is getting  famous.  He's like Emmy  nominated for that  Cash Cab.  I don't like it because  I never get them  right.  He won.  Really?  Wait, he didn't win an  Emmy.  Yeah.  He won an Emmy for  Cash Cab won.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought he  lost Best Host or  something, right?  Yeah, but the show  won.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  I didn't know that.  What's weird about  Cash Cab is it's been  on a while now. 
[00:48:30]  A couple years, yeah.  And all of a sudden  everyone is discovering  this show.  The show has a major  buzz now.  I heard Alex Trebek  told him he should  have won.  Ben is getting really  famous.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I hated the show.  I get none of the  questions right.  I like easy ones.  I feel like such a  I like Wheel of Fortune.  You know, I see maybe  there's a T.  It's, you know,  Vanna's proper name.  But, yeah, man,  Ben is doing great.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  He's on fire today.  He writes,  Hey, Ope, 
[00:49:00]  at what point did you  guys decide it would  be a good idea to  talk more?  Because remember we  were explaining that  yesterday that we  needed to talk more  because the music  wasn't getting the job  done?  So as you listen to  this crap, Anthony  and I decided not  only we need to talk  more, we need to be  dropping music because  we're just doing a  really good job here.  I think we were  listening to the PD  a lot.  I think he actually  told us, look,  talk about New York. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, you don't have  to be so, yeah,  open yourself up a  little more.  You don't have to be  so shocking and  things.  I really think we  took his advice.  Well, you're just  trying to kind of  connect a little bit.  Yeah, I think we  listened for like a  week and then we  turned into the  douches that we  are today.  All right, we got  to take a break.  877-212-01A.  We'll have more  audio from our  first show 10 years  ago.  And let's not forget,  for the faithful  listeners, this show  is definitely in red  alert mode. 
[00:50:00]  And that's all we  could say right now.  We'll have more  details hopefully in  the next day or two.  The Opian Anthony  traveling virus is  back.  And this year, we're  allowing you, the  listener, to help us  pick which comedians  are on the bill.  Just go to  virusvote.com.  That's virusvote.com  and pick which  three comedians you  would most like to  see on the bill.  And out of those  results, we'll pick  which ones are at  the show.  You're checking out 
[00:50:30]  the Opian Anthony  show.  877-212-01A.  We got lots going on  today.  I don't even know if  people are enjoying  the audio from 10  years ago.  Well, probably not  in the way we would  have liked.  I knew our...  But I would think  it's pretty interesting. 
[00:51:00]  I knew our 10-year  anniversary was around  this time, but I think  E-Rock or somebody  brought it to our  attention, so they  kind of threw some  stuff together really  fast, and E-Rock  found audio of our  first show in New  York City radio, and  it's kind of  uncomfortable to  listen to, to be  honest with you.  Yeah.  We have no problem  throwing each other  under the bus, so we  figured we'd throw  the whole show  under the bus, except  for Jimmy, of course.  This is pre-Jimmy  days.  Who's just having fun  listening to this. 
[00:51:30]  What do you think so  far, Jimmy?  It's not awful.  It's just the two  guys that are a little  nervous.  I mean, because I  met you not too long  after, a couple years  after, I guess it's  like 2000, so it's  like you don't go from  being bad to being as  good as the show was  in two years.  It was just, you  know, probably first  day jitters.  You're coming out to  a legendary music  station.  I got to get, I  mean, you know, it's  not like when you  listen to the old  stuff, you can tell  you're just like,  you know, hey, how  are you?  I'm good.  Better now than I'm  with you.  Okay.  You know, it's like  you guys had settled  down and, you know,  you're doing your  thing.  Settle down. 
[00:52:00]  He's already doing  dice and, you know,  you can just see.  All right.  We're revving up?  Yeah.  It's hard to say  your first day.  I'd love to hear a  weekend and hear how  that happy to be there  is kind of fading.  That's true.  Yeah.  That would actually be  the good audio.  Yeah.  Where did we make the  turn?  Actually, we have audio  of making the turn that  we're going to get to  maybe tomorrow.  Carol Miller tapes.  Yeah.  We weren't being polite  or nice anymore.  No.  And this was probably  a couple months in.  So, Jimmy, this is  pretty much what you're  talking about, where we  made her, like, stay in 
[00:52:30]  the mail room until we,  like, walked past her  and all sorts of crap.  True stories, Stunt Brain.  Stunt Brain's learning a  lot by hanging with us.  You heard the stories,  right?  Yeah.  Over the years?  They're all true, my  friend.  Except for Opie making  friends in the park.  Well, yeah, yeah.  That was just an outright  lie.  Friends.  Bud's in the park.  Welcoming us back on the  phone.  You made it seem like it  was a hero's return.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  We're finally back and  they're coming up to me in  the park going, really?  You guys again?  All right.  Congrats.  I'm a real treat making  friends wherever I go.  Rollerblade and looking at  topless chicks.  It's madness already, folks.  You ain't seen nothing yet.  Pandemonium.  All right.  Let's get back to the  audio from 10 years ago.  1027 WNEW where Rock lives.  Bad company and can't get  enough of your love.  Oh, this is awful.  Playlist.  I hate NEW's playlist.  Bad company.  I never enjoyed it. 
[00:53:30]  I suppose you didn't say  bad co.  Bad co.  A little bad co.  It's bad co from bad co off  of bad co.  Your love.  And unfortunately, I ran  out of tokens anyway, so.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Opie's getting up and he's  leaving.  He's leaving his post.  I know what this is about.  Wait a minute.  E-Rock's just sitting there 
[00:54:00]  laughing.  Yeah.  He loves this stuff.  See, you can't get enough  of your love because I'm at  a peep show.  Right.  And I ran out of quarters.  It's all theater of the mind,  Opie.  You really painted a picture  there.  So the loving is now gone.  Right.  Oh.  No more loving for me.  Company and can't get enough  of your love.  And unfortunately, I ran out  of tokens anyway, so.  We'll get into that break.  I thought it was hysterical.  You really thought it was funny. 
[00:54:30]  I laughed at everything.  I laughed at everything.  Can we hear Anthony laugh  again, please?  Jesus, Jimmy.  Thanks.  Look, Anthony knows comedy.  What can I tell you?  Oh, yeah.  What can I tell you?  Not a tokens anyway, so.  We'll get into that break  on another day, right?  Sure.  Peatland.  Peatland rules.  It's like Disney here in New York.  Is it?  Is it really like Disney?  Just like it, Opie.  Just like Disney. 
[00:55:00]  Just like it.  They own 42nd Street now.  This is painful.  And another story we're going  to get to another day  because, you know,  we don't want to give everybody  the good stuff on day one.  I am a chuckling ass.  Just, it doesn't matter  what anyone is saying.  If they intended to be funny,  I would just laugh.  Let me feel better about myself  and look at my girlfriend.  That makes us feel better  about ourselves, too.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  See, kids, you could be somebody.  Jeez.  Like Disney here in New York.  Well, now the Disney stores  are taking over the Peatland shops.  That's true.  You really got to hunt  to find them these days.  Times have definitely changed  since the last time  we were in New York,  I must say.  Hold on.  What was it that you had to hunt  to find them these days?  Jimmy's got to pick up  on every little nuance.  You suck.  I'm going to hunt  to find them these days. 
[00:56:00]  These days.  And then I have to say  times have changed  since we were last  in New York City.  The last time I was  in New York City  was probably for  a Deep Purple show  when I was in high school.  Mine was a field trip  to the Museum of Natural History  when I was in the sixth grade.  We act.  Like I'm out there,  you know,  working the streets.  Hustling.  We act like we were  always part of New York,  but we had to go away  for a few years.  Going to the city for me  was going to Huntington Village. 
[00:56:30]  That was the city.  Times have changed  since we were last  in New York City.  Let me tell you,  times have changed.  I could come in  without a permission slip.  I don't even think  I ever spent a night  in New York City  before we got the job  at N.E.W.  What am I talking about?  We stink.  We would go on  the Long Island Railroad  to see a show  at Madison Square Garden  and then we'd go home.  What am I talking about? 
[00:57:00]  I wasn't part of this city.  Yeah, do you ever stay in?  No.  No, get on that train.  Could afford it.  Get back to White Trashville.  All right,  let's move on  with this one.  It's Opie and Anthony.  New guys at N.E.W.  What do you got there?  I see a familiar name  at the bottom of that.  I got a fax  from Dave Herman.  Dave Herman sued us!  What am I doing?  He hated us too!  From day one,  all of these classic jocks 
[00:57:30]  hated us.  And the only reason  they were faxing  and calling and stuff  because they knew  they can't possibly  be on the radio  a week or two from now  so we should be polite  and be nice to them.  Yeah, we'll be nice  because they're so bad  they're just going  to get the boot.  True story,  Dave Herman sued us.  Yeah.  For millions of dollars  he hated our guts.  They started hanging up faxes.  I said...  Oh, you did?  Yeah, the people...  They were awful to us.  Yeah.  They hated us.  From day one. 
[00:58:00]  What were we trying  to schmooze them for?  Because we were nice.  We're the new guys.  No, because anyone  who was listening  to N.E.W. back then  loved these jocks  for what reason  I really couldn't tell you.  And then we realized  we had to just purge  those people.  Right.  But we had to kind of  fit in with these guys  so we figured if  you know,  if they're talking  nice about us  we should let  everyone out there know.  Look, they like us  so maybe you should  like us too.  Yeah, you please like us.  It was all psychological.  Please like us.  But Herman hated us. 
[00:58:30]  He sued us.  It's Opie and Anthony.  New guys at N.E.W.  What do you got there?  I see a familiar name  at the bottom of that.  I got a fax from Dave Herman.  Wait a minute.  O&A, you guys sang  what?  Here's how it works.  Here's how it worked  at N.E.W.  Opie and Anthony  sat across from each other.  They look at each other  and there was a couple  of feet of space.  So how was Opie  holding a paper  and you going,  hey, what is that?  There's a familiar name  at the bottom.  How would you,  I don't understand.  First of all,  how would you,  A, see any of it  but B,  how would you only see  Dave Herman 
[00:59:00]  at the very bottom  when he's facing  it away from you?  How did that happen?  It's called fear  of the mind, Jimmy.  I don't know, Jimmy.  I'm trying to think now  and figure out  how I saw that name.  We were just  bestest pals back then.  Oh, yeah.  Now we just  hate each other  and we're doing this  for a paycheck.  All right, I said it.  Yeah, I said it.  Jeez.  What happened?  Hey, what have you got there, Ope?  Now, you know,  C.W. from Scranton writes, 
[00:59:30]  hey, what have you got there, Ope?  Oh, I've got a telegram  from Gerald Ford.  By the way,  Travis points out  something good, apparently.  Yeah.  Did Anthony say  peep shows are taking over  and then agrees with Ope  and says you can't  find them anymore?  Oh, did I?  Why wouldn't I just agree?  Agree, agree.  Be likable.  Agree, agree.  Laugh, laugh, laugh.  Laugh, laugh, agree.  Agree, laugh.  As I'm sitting there,  please like me,  please like me,  please like me. 
[01:00:00]  Hey, what's that little,  uh,  what's that little thing there  jotted down in the corner  that I can't see,  but yet I know  it's a familiar name.  Familiar name on there,  Ope?  What, uh,  what is that?  Yeah.  See me across from each other  and papers away from you.  You picked up on that.  And you asked about that.  You didn't say,  hey,  what's the Dave Herman thing about?  You went,  what is that?  What is that?  Hey,  it looks like a familiar name on there.  I'm setting it up  for something big.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you tell everybody  what that is? 
[01:00:30]  What is it?  A subpoena?  Oh God,  what phonies,  what phony crocs of crap we were.  Look,  I could,  uh,  I could say this much.  Dave Herman did hate us  and he had a guy.  I could say this much.  He had a guy  that was pretty much wire,  uh,  uh,  tapping us.  I was taping our conversations.  I swear.  Yes.  And this guy acted like  he was our pal 
[01:01:00]  and he was secretly  taping Anthony and I  in the studio  when we weren't on the air.  Off mic.  Talking badly about everybody  and,  and obviously the,  you know,  the court said,  look,  this is wire tapping.  You can't use this in the case.  Inadmissible.  But it is a fact.  Somebody was taping us  when we weren't on the air.  This was the real environment  we were in.  Agree,  agree.  Laugh,  laugh,  laugh.  It's Opie and Anthony.  New guys at NEW.  What do you got there?  I see a familiar name 
[01:01:30]  at the bottom of that.  I got a fax from Dave Herman.  ONA,  you guys sound great.  Welcome to the team.  Very cool.  Thanks, Dave.  Wow.  And Vince Skelsa,  he sent in a fax  to welcome us.  Carol Miller  popped her head in.  Mm-hmm.  Tony Pig's,  uh,  roaming the hallways  and he's,  uh,  giving us his best so far.  Scott's,  yeah,  talking about his ball cancer.  Nothing about yourself,  ball cancer.  That's what he talked about.  I like,  you know how I survived ball cancer.  Giving us his best so far. 
[01:02:00]  Listen to the way you said so far.  So far.  Giving us his best so far.  Listen to the way you said that.  And you know how radio works.  These guys,  uh,  were,  were complimenting us and stuff  because they knew,  look,  look,  they ain't gonna last.  Yeah.  We feel sorry for them.  Little did they know.  Exactly.  You had destroyed the empire.  They had built their whole lives.  Yes.  Agree,  agree,  laugh,  laugh.  Laugh,  laugh,  agree,  agree,  laugh.  Laugh,  laugh, 
[01:02:30]  time to agree,  agree,  agree,  please like me,  please like me,  agree,  agree,  laugh,  laugh,  laugh.  And he's,  uh,  given us his best so far.  Scotso's been in his office listening.  He's,  he waited until we were on the air.  Yeah.  To check out what,  what,  what we were doing.  Uh huh.  And it's cool because,  uh,  if you ever saw Scott's office,  oh my God,  it is like a rock and roll museum in there.  We can make a lot of money.  Just put the velvet ropes up in front of his office.  And we can charge,  agree,  agree.  Let people go in there. 
[01:03:00]  And,  you know,  you can tell them about what the pictures are.  Yeah.  Here's where I was pretty intoxicated with Keith Moon.  That's what he told us today.  I thought I wasn't going to tell the story.  Oh my God,  that's what he told us today.  Agree.  Laugh,  agree.  Scotso was in his office listening to this.  I'm surprised it didn't end like Brooks in Shawshank.  And him just swinging from an I-beam.  I can't take this.  They've destroyed my station.  Look how,  look how excited I am because Anthony told a story that Scott Muni actually told us. 
[01:03:30]  He told us today.  He knows.  That's how it used to be.  I mean,  how many people have a picture with Keith Moon?  Not many.  A lot,  probably.  Out of all the people in the who,  what do you think?  How many people have a picture of Keith Moon?  Hundreds of thousands,  perhaps.  Yeah,  but that,  you know,  that was still cool to me.  Well,  that's the picture right there. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Put that up on onaradio.com today.  It's very cool,  but he's actually,  I mean,  it is a cool picture.  It's a cool picture.  Onus Wagner card.  God almighty,  how many people have circled the moon while Aldrin and,  and we get it.  It's a lot.  It's just,  I was very happy.  Agree,  agree,  agree.  And let it be known,  not a bad word to say about Scott Muni.  The guy was a class act.  I never remember.  It was the other guys.  Does that keep you holding the microphone? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Yep.  How many,  you know,  out of all the people,  cause I,  I grew up listening to N.E.W.  Uh,  you're a liar.  I was nervous to meet around here.  I mean,  Carol Miller was cool and Dave Herman and Tony Pig and the rest.  Scott,  Scott Muni.  Yeah.  It was just like,  Oh,  uh,  hi Scott.  How are you?  Legend,  man.  Don't worry.  We won't blow up this place on you.  We won't.  We absolutely did.  We blew the place up on everybody.  Exactly. 
[01:05:00]  Don't worry.  We won't blow this place up on you.  Don't worry.  You've been playing rock and roll for 40 years.  You're leaving it in good hand.  That's going to come to an end.  Oh,  a mere four years later.  What are they doing now?  Fresh?  Yeah.  We didn't blow it up.  Huh?  Your name should have been the Molotov and cocktail.  Wow.  If that wasn't,  uh,  telling on it,  don't worry.  We will blow up this place.  And then we exactly what we did.  Blow it up.  Hi Scott. 
[01:05:30]  How are you?  Legend.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  We won't blow up this place on you.  You know,  I know.  It's scary.  Cause he goes,  I'm going to be listening to your,  your,  your first show today.  I said,  Oh no.  I said,  please don't be harsh.  He goes,  not,  no,  I will be harsh.  It's all fun.  All fun.  I'm like,  okay,  thank you,  Mr.  Muni.  I'm going to go hide in this corner for a little longer before our first air shift at  any W laugh,  laugh,  agree.  Laugh,  laugh,  laugh.  How much fun was it?  Please like me.  Please like me. 
[01:06:00]  One flag of fun.  One flag.  Yeah.  Not too intimidating around here,  huh?  No,  not at all.  Hey,  the management of NAW wants us to do traffic.  So,  uh,  Anthony,  the traffic report for all the fine folks,  uh,  on the highways and byways.  All right.  The traffic is,  uh,  pretty much in the same spots it's been for the past couple of years.  All right.  You were in traffic yesterday.  You're in traffic today.  Same places.  So basically traffic stinks once again today.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  See,  uh,  that was us being edgy. 
[01:06:30]  That was our ed,  our first edgy break ever.  This was us like going against management because they really want us to do traffic.  So we're like,  watch what we do with this one.  Watch what we do.  Oh,  God.  Time for one more before break.  You guys lasted past this first whirlwind day.  Hey,  uh,  this next,  uh,  break,  I,  I,  it's just labeled Anthony takes a cab.  Oh,  Christ.  What? 
[01:07:00]  Is this another look at me?  I'm a New Yorker kind of,  uh,  break.  Fantastic.  Anthony takes a cab.  Anthony buys a,  a wiener on the road side.  Wow.  I'm just being a New Yorker.  Anthony takes a horse and carriage ride.  Yeah.  Look at me.  New Yorkers do.  Anthony's going to take in a ball game.  Yeah.  Anthony goes to Broadway. 
[01:07:30]  This is terrible.  Cause they wanted us to sound like New Yorkers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's listen to,  and then it,  this,  this turned into eventually me hailing a cab in Nazi regalia to see if I could get a cab before a black guy.  Yeah.  See that video.  It does very well by the way.  Yeah,  it does.  It's up on YouTube.  Maybe we can link it.  Oh,  a radio.com.  Anthony takes a cab.  This is a 10 years ago.  If you're just tuning in, 
[01:08:00]  we found out it's our 10 year anniversary being in a New York city radio,  even though we've only done about seven years and nine months of actual radio.  But we started 10 years ago yesterday.  And today.  Speaking of traffic.  Yeah.  Did I beat you to the studio today?  You did.  It's,  you know,  big story in the news is all the,  the cars that are coming into Manhattan these days.  Yeah.  It's just huge amounts of cars.  You can't drive.  I can't get through a minute of this audio. 
[01:08:30]  I can't get through it without commenting.  What am I talking about?  It was headline news.  A lot of cars today,  folks.  Well,  you know,  let me,  let me let people in on a little secret.  A lot of cars in New York city.  These days.  These days.  You know,  I remember a few months back and nothing.  It was Apple carts that people were pushing down the streets.  Don Corleone was getting some fruit.  What? 
[01:09:00]  Big news there.  Let me tell you a lot of cars these days.  I don't know what I don't think I've ever been more uncomfortable.  A dick.  These days.  Yeah.  It's just huge amounts of cars.  You can't drive,  especially in the middle of the day.  It's crazy.  Well,  a lot of people want to get to know us and stuff.  And let me tell you one thing.  Do they?  Do they really?  Do they really want to get to know us?  Oh,  do they really want to get to know us? 
[01:09:30]  A lot of people.  Jimmy,  what do you got on that?  I'm saying people really want to get to know us.  People really want to get to know us.  Why don't you tell the fine folks out there a little bit about Opie and Anthony?  Well,  they probably want to know,  like,  who are these two tools?  I'm wasting my time.  I have to know who they are.  What do they have to know?  This is so bad.  And we're just lying.  You're a liar.  This is some of the most dishonest radio I've ever heard because it's not us.  Yeah.  We're not acting or talking like us. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  We're just telling lies about what we've done to try to sound more New York.  We're acting like we showed up and it was like the Beatles.  Like,  we had to,  like,  kind of run into the building to start our radio show.  And they're pounding on the windows.  People just wanted to meet us and see us.  And our phones are ringing.  They just need to,  like,  they just need to soak up everything Opie and Anthony.  Our phones were like,  our phones weren't even ringing. 
[01:10:30]  No.  And the ones that were,  it was,  it was an occasional call that said,  shut up and play the music.  Yeah.  Why don't you guys just shut up and play the music?  Well,  we're telling everyone,  oh,  everyone needs to know everything about us.  Were we doing live calls at that point?  Or are we still recording calls and playing them?  We were recording calls.  Were we?  Because we were,  like,  if we took them live,  it was just,  you guys suck.  Yeah.  Get off the air.  And then we'd hear the fax machine start,  like, 
[01:11:00]  yeah,  revving up and we were just,  we would both just stare at it.  Oh,  here comes a compliment.  I know it.  I wonder what this is.  I know someone's going to be saying something really nice through their fax.  Oh,  it's a deli menu.  It's so weird.  It's crazy.  By the way,  you guys saying fax so much.  Yeah.  No one faxes and stuff.  It's amazing,  like,  in the last 10 years,  how much things have changed.  This was really at the end of the whole fax run.  People ask me to say,  like,  do you have a fax?  No.  My house? 
[01:11:30]  No.  Well,  sometimes you got a fax contract back and forth.  It's the only reason I have one.  I don't.  You're probably right to have one.  You should have one just for that.  I know Bob's always yelling at us for not having,  or not us,  you,  an opie.  Whatever.  I don't have a four footbill,  footbill.  Four footbill?  I don't have one of those either.  I don't even know what it is.  I like to play footbill.  Footbill.  Facts.  What is that?  I don't even know how much money I make.  I really don't.  I have no clue.  I ask Anthony every once in a while, 
[01:12:00]  and he tells me.  I'm like,  oh,  okay.  Not as much as a couple of months ago,  apparently.  Whoa!  Hey!  Hey!  You can't drive,  especially in the middle of the day.  It's crazy.  Well,  a lot of people want to get to know us and stuff,  and let me tell you one thing.  Opie,  that's me.  Okay,  we're both staying in hotels right now in the city.  Opie likes to walk to NEW, 
[01:12:30]  likes to walk to 12 to 14.  You're dope.  Anthony,  the lazy one,  doesn't like to walk.  I'm not lazy.  I'm just doing things right up to the minute,  so I want to jump into a cab and get here.  I'm online.  I'm doing things.  So,  Opie gets to see all the fine sights of New York City,  and Anthony,  I don't know,  he's in a smelly cab.  So,  but if Anthony's in a,  wouldn't he also be seeing,  like,  I could see.  There are windows in a cab,  Opie.  Is that a trunk?  Like a hostage?  Right. 
[01:13:00]  And what's with my whole,  yeah,  I'm doing things.  I'm online.  It's that voice I put on.  I'm trying to convince everyone I'm a true New Yorker.  Yeah,  you're walking your rollerblade,  and you're making buds.  I'm taking it all in.  Yeah,  you're soaking it in,  man.  I'm walking the streets.  Yeah.  Oh,  where was a homeless guy to just cave your head in?  You should have had your hat removed at some point.  Some New York City, 
[01:13:30]  and Anthony,  I don't know,  he's in a smelly cab.  And,  yeah,  I got to listen to this.  Hi,  this is Joan Rivers.  Buckle up for safety.  Great.  Hi,  this is Judd Hirsch.  I know a little something about taxi cabs.  All right.  Enough.  I heard that eight billion times.  Oh,  this one.  Oh,  it's the Catwoman.  It's a kid.  Buckle up for safety. 
[01:14:00]  Oh,  God,  can you get some more celebrities,  please?  Enough.  I've only heard those three,  but about two blocks from the station,  I actually passed your cab.  Yeah,  I looked out the window.  It's like,  I'll be.  Can I tell you something?  That didn't happen.  That didn't happen.  More lies.  That's what he did not pass me in a cab as I was walking.  You know what the odds of that would be?  Two to one.  You're a liar.  See, 
[01:14:30]  I needed to,  I needed to say that to make our,  point that cars move really slow in Manhattan.  Yeah.  I actually passed your cab.  Yeah,  I looked out the window.  It's like,  I'll be.  Wait a minute.  We left at the same time.  Same time.  Yeah.  It took me,  I think,  10 minutes to get a cab.  Uh-huh.  And then,  I told him where we were going.  He turns the corner.  Dead stop traffic.  Oh,  there goes Opie walking by.  Bye.  It was a free ride for me.  Were you even staying in the city at a hotel? 
[01:15:00]  I don't even think you were.  I wasn't.  I was,  I was in,  uh,  Huntington.  Uh,  yeah,  because I had already gotten a house for rent.  We're just lying to be liked.  So,  Opie was staying in a hotel.  I wasn't.  I was staying,  uh,  I already rented a house,  so I was driving in.  So,  I was driving in every day.  Right.  Bye.  It was a free ride for me.  It cost you 10 bucks.  Uh-huh.  All right.  How,  how are the rest of the faxes? 
[01:15:30]  Uh,  good.  Yeah,  right.  Oh,  except for this one.  Oh,  good.  And,  and this one.  And,  oh,  and this one.  Well,  we're warming up.  At least we kind of acknowledged the fact that we were getting bashed on the fax machine.  we're warming up a little bit.  Wow.  I don't know.  Maybe we'll play a few more after the break.  There is one that says,  uh,  summer songs,  fudgy wudgy bars.  You didn't bring back the fudgy wudgy bar from,  A-Rock,  what's up?  Oh,  it's me talking about fudgy wudgy bars. 
[01:16:00]  Also,  uh,  we discussed the weather for two minutes and 37 seconds.  I get out of here.  Oh,  stinkeroo.  New movies coming out,  and I have a cute story about getting a speeding ticket.  I'll be nostalgic.  Anything you want to say,  A-Rock?  What's on the way here?  Uh,  no,  it speaks for itself.  All right.  It's,  uh,  Opie and Anthony,  877-212-0&A,  some audio from 10 years ago.  Go. 
[01:16:30]  Hey,  good morning to everybody.  It's the Opie and Anthony show doing something a little different today.  We're going to,  we're going to,  uh,  see what's going on in the world,  uh,  very,  very soon,  but I think we got one more,  segment of,  uh,  audio from 10 years ago.  What the hell is going on?  Go ahead.  I don't know.  All of a sudden,  uh,  I think you were listening to the old tapes and decided I shouldn't talk.  Oh,  and I should.  Turn my mic off. 
[01:17:00]  Oh,  and I should.  Laugh,  laugh,  laugh,  agree,  agree.  Agree,  laugh,  laugh,  agree,  agree,  agree.  You're nice.  Please like me.  Please like me.  Please like me.  You're a nice guy.  What's wrong with that?  Keep being nice.  Laugh,  agree,  agree,  laugh,  laugh,  agree.  877-212-ON-A.  Oh,  sorry.  Stepped all over the phone number.  Yeah,  because I'm depressed.  I'm all flustered.  I know.  I'm all flustered.  I don't know what I should sound like.  You know how many times I thought in the last hour and a half that I'm just a fraud? 
[01:17:30]  A fraud?  That's a good word for it.  What am I doing?  Ugh.  All right,  we go back in time.  Ten years ago,  we did our first show for New York City because everyone was just clamoring for us.  Oh,  yeah.  They were writing and going,  where are those Opie and Anthony guys?  We need them here in New York City.  Yep.  Oh,  now they're here.  Thank God.  Thank God.  They're here to save radio. 
[01:18:00]  That's what we were hoping.  God.  The next break,  we talk about summer songs,  I guess,  and Fudgy Wudgy Bars.  This is us.  Ten years ago.  Today and yesterday or something.  1027 WNEW,  where rock lives.  Spin Doctors,  Little Miss Can't Be You Wrong from 1992.  I got to mention,  back in 1992,  you couldn't go anywhere without hearing that song on the beat.  Really?  Really?  Obst is being a rock jag. 
[01:18:30]  Really?  I had to mention that one.  That was pertinent information for everybody out there.  Little Miss Can't Be Wrong.  You know,  back in 92,  coming at you.  What's wrong with informing people about the music?  Got it.  No one's wrong.  Got it.  No one gives a crap.  I don't care.  Go anywhere without hearing that song on the beaches of New York. 
[01:19:00]  That was the summer song.  Now I got to bring in the beaches of New York,  because we're talking about all of New York.  We took care of the cabs,  Central Park,  the peep shows,  Times Square.  Now it's time to talk about the beaches,  because we know New Yorkers go to the beaches, too.  Sure.  Let's try to hit everything.  And again,  I'm just agreeing.  Yeah.  Next break,  we're going to talk about skyscrapers.  Why did they hire us? 
[01:19:30]  How desperate were they?  I thought we were good in Boston,  but...  No kidding.  What happened?  That was the summer song that year.  Of 1992,  I can't believe.  I wonder what this year's song is going to be.  Hmm.  No songs,  you know,  stand out yet.  Was I pondering that?  Was I actually pondering?  Hmm.  Can you put this picture up?  Ugh.  Of Anthony and I  with the lead singer of the Spin Doctors.  Bloated Anthony.  Oh, Chris, right?  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  He's a cool guy, actually.  Yeah, he's really cool.  We've seen him over the years.  Onaradio.com  We'll put some of these older pictures up.  Ugh.  Christ.  I don't stand out yet.  As far as that one killer summer song.  Hmm.  Remember Come On, Eileen?  Yeah.  That was a summer song.  Right?  Why are you laughing?  Why would I laugh at Come On, Eileen?  Why are you laughing?  Yeah, I remember that, Hopi.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, just laugh.  Laugh because you're uncomfortable.  And I'm trying to, like, you know,  sound sexy for everybody.  Yeah.  But that's...  Don't want to be too harsh.  This is a delivery, you know.  What is it, Jim?  Tell...  Why don't you tell us what it is, Jim?  I'm only saying...  I've been listening...  My ears have been working for 39 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I've heard a lot of conversation.  And I want to congratulate you two  on the most inane conversation I've ever heard. 
[01:21:00]  That's a summer song.  I remember.  Yeah.  What?  He's talking about where rock lives.  Does it live here?  And it doesn't live anywhere else?  No.  What does that say for every other radio station  that's playing rock?  What does that mean?  Where rock lives?  We are just audio diarrhea.  That's what this is. 
[01:21:30]  Just creating water.  Water cooler talk.  Oh, did you hear their break on summer songs?  Oh, you've got to listen to these, Till.  These guys...  You can't turn them off.  I was sitting in my car in front of work.  I had a B in.  You should have heard their spin doctor break.  It's one for the ages, I've got to tell you.  I couldn't get out of my car.  I was late for work.  I had to know how is this going to end.  Hopefully with a firing.  And just when you thought they couldn't get crazier,  they mentioned, come on, Eileen. 
[01:22:00]  And Anthony and me, at the same time,  we're just laughing and laughing.  He's on the radio laughing.  I'm in my car just laughing.  Were you really laughing there, Ann?  I didn't catch that one.  Oh, please play it again.  I'd love to hear that again, if you don't mind.  Summer songs.  I mean, summer songs.  Can you believe it?  Can you believe it?  Summer song.  Remember, come on, Eileen?  Yeah.  That was a summer song.  Right? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  I would like to know what you're laughing at.  What the hell?  There better have been something funny going.  Someone better have hit someone with a pie.  Maybe that's what happened.  It was a visual gag that didn't play for the radio.  Someone got hit with a big cream pie in the face,  and I started laughing.  Because there's no way I should be laughing  from Opie just saying, come on, Eileen.  And it was contagious, because then other people were laughing.  God, I just want to go back and punch me in the face. 
[01:23:00]  Why?  Because I stunk.  Hey, you didn't.  You were just having fun.  Shut it.  You made a joke.  You left.  Yeah.  That was a summer song.  Right?  Yeah.  I mean, good song, but wherever you went, that you...  But it wasn't a good song.  That was a summer song.  As you're laying on Jones Beach.  See, now, let's go over.  Here we go.  Not only are we talking about beaches,  now we've got to mention Jones Beach,  because that's a local beach.  I don't think you've ever laid on Jones Beach in your life.  Passed out, maybe. 
[01:23:30]  At least not...  Whenever he was on Jones Beach,  he always had a collared shirt and boots on and jeans.  This Nick from Connecticut has it absolutely down.  He hit the nail on the head.  Nick.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing, man?  Yeah, I was just listening.  I noticed, Anthony, from those old clips,  that's exactly what's going on there.  You just have a nervous tick,  and the only thing you can do is laugh.  Yeah, it's...  I'm laughing out of being nervous 
[01:24:00]  and being uncomfortable,  and I feel I have to just laugh at everything.  Yeah, Nick's on, though.  It was pretty much...  I can't believe that we're here.  This is insane.  Come on, Eileen.  And here's what's going on in my head.  Why did he say that?  I better laugh  so people think what was just said is funny.  We're laughing inside our brains.  We have no business being here.  We're saying nothing.  As you're laying on Jones Beach,  hearing,  Fudgy Wudgy Boss! 
[01:24:30]  Fudgy Wudgy Boss!  It's going to be back, isn't it?  Oh, wow.  Did you just say it's good to be back, isn't it?  No, it isn't.  This is as painful as our first show ever.  Maybe even more,  because we had been in radio for years already.  No way.  Although, I do have...  This is funny.  Play that.  I want to hear this joke.  Listen to what song is on. 
[01:25:00]  It just makes you laugh.  This is hysterical.  It just makes you laugh.  Come on.  Oh, is that funny?  Oh, wow.  You've got to be kidding me.  It's so funny.  It just brings laughter, this song. 
[01:25:30]  Are you laughing out there?  Are you?  Well, you know, as Opie did say,  it is a good song.  That was the worst.  You couldn't believe that even.  You would lick your mouth open  and things just came out of it.  People are complaining  they're getting douchey-wooshy chills.  Douchey-wooshy. 
[01:26:00]  Horrid.  Brendan from Long Island writes,  Opie sounded like Samantha from Sex and the City  when he described,  Come on, Eileen.  Speaking of...  Horrible.  Well, why don't we play this next break?  We're almost done for today.  The next break,  we discuss the weather.  Yeah, at least it was a quick little hit  on the weather.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where rock lives.  Led Zeppelin, of course. 
[01:26:30]  I've got to remind the people,  all right,  when you hear  It's Only Rock and Roll  by the Rolling Stones  later this hour,  be the 10th caller,  and you've got a  hacky radio contest.  Hack!  We were doing  hacky radio contest?  Hack!  Hey, when you hear it,  I'll get the TSL up.  People will spend  more time listening.  We're looking to build queue.  Yeah.  What?  Or be the 10th caller.  I hope I choke  on this camelot.  And you've got a four-pack  of tickets to see.  Four-pack. 
[01:27:00]  A four-pack.  Yeah.  I can roll  by the Rolling Stones  later this hour,  be the 10th caller,  and you've got  a four-pack of tickets  to see Don Henley,  Pete Townsend,  Stevie Nicks,  and Joni Mitchell  Friday, August 14th,  and Saturday, August 15th.  It's a day in the garden  at Yazgar's Farm,  Bethel, New York.  And I hope it's not  hot as hell like today.  Ho-ho!  The baked apple today,  Hopie!  Why did I say that?  The big what?  The baked apple.  I was trying  to be sarcastic. 
[01:27:30]  That's the only defense  I'll give myself.  I was trying to sound  like one of those  puker jocks.  Not knowing that  Hopie was already  doing a great job.  He's referring to,  you know,  every time it got  really hot,  because New York City  is known as  the Big Apple,  but we barely say  that anymore  in New York City,  that the apple  would now be baked  because it's so hot.  And the front page  of the newspapers  back in the day  would show like an apple,  kind of like,  you know,  a baked apple  because it was so hot.  Yeah.  So hot. 
[01:28:00]  You should have said  the stinky apple.  You know why?  Why, Jimmy?  Because this stinks.  It's so bad.  Hot as hell,  like today.  Oh, the baked apple  today, Hopie.  Yeah, we should  introduce ourselves  because it's our  second day.  It's Hopie and Anthony.  Hey, what's...  Oh, so this is  our second day.  So now we're  going to rule.  Wow, we're...  We've got to  introduce ourselves  because, you know,  the word is out.  You know, I've been  listening to these guys,  but I don't know  their names. 
[01:28:30]  I just need to know more.  It's our second day.  It's Hopie and Anthony.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  It sucks outside.  Hot town.  Summer in the city.  What?  Were you too far  to punch me?  Were you too far away?  I can't remember  the console.  Perhaps you were  just too far away  to lean over  and bitch slap me.  When are they  going to build  that time machine?  When?  When?  You're kidding.  I'm going to go home 
[01:29:00]  and I'm going to be  very depressed today.  I was kidding,  but I don't think  people really knew  I was kidding.  And I really  sounded stupid.  What's up?  What's up?  It sucks outside.  Hot town.  Summer in the city.  Hopie.  Whoa, that temperature.  Sure is going up  the old thermometer today.  It's the baked apple.  But we're very...  How tired are you  hearing that?  Well, we're very prepared  for the heat wave  in the city  because we were watching  the new news today  on Channel 2.  No, every newscast. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, I thought  it was just Channel...  Oh, we still do  this break today.  Yeah, uh-oh.  The old,  it's hot break.  Drill that into the  goddamn ground.  I almost dropped  the F on.  This can be embarrassing  because I think  we did this break still.  Every newscast.  Oh, I thought  it was just Channel 2.  Top Story,  telling us things  that I think  are common sense.  Hmm?  Make sure you  drink plenty of fluids.  You know,  you might be thirsty  and, unless we told you,  forget to drink. 
[01:30:00]  You know,  so we're here  to let you know.  We're like  comfortable clothing.  You know,  I saw somebody  ready to leave  in a parka  this morning  and I said,  hey,  it's going to be  pretty hot.  Maybe you ought to  wear something light.  And he said,  hey, thank you.  I probably would have died.  Yeah,  I don't understand  why they have  to go on the news  and state the obvious.  Drink plenty of fluids,  wear the light,  comfortable clothing.  Yeah.  What about this one?  Check on the elderly.  Check the elderly.  They shouldn't be  outdoors today.  You know,  if you made it  to 80,  85 years old,  you know how to 
[01:30:30]  handle yourself  in the heat, right?  I think there's probably  been a couple of  heat waves  that they've lived through.  Right.  You know,  and the other one  is don't over-exert  yourself.  You know,  if you planned on  lifting a few cars  in this heat,  don't.  Don't do that.  I thought we were  going to run a marathon  in Central Park today.  Today's the perfect day,  right?  And no alcohol.  No alcohol.  And I don't understand  this because  in the wintertime,  when you get  the first snowfall  and they go through  the laundry list  of things to do  when it snows,  they also tell you 
[01:31:00]  don't drink.  When the hell  are we supposed to drink?  Yeah,  they just don't want  us to drink anymore.  I think that's it.  Hey,  it's a mild day  in the 70s  and remember,  no alcohol.  Right.  Wait a minute.  I want a beer.  I like a Wobbly Pop  every once in a while.  Oh my God,  no.  Oh no.  Perhaps  the time to drink  is during the show  if you're listening.  What was a Wobbly Pop?  Yeah,  I knew.  What was that?  I knew Jimmy  couldn't leave  that one alone.  Well, 
[01:31:30]  Jimmy,  if you need to know,  a Wobbly Pop  is a beer  because if you have  enough of them,  you start wobbling  around as you try  to walk.  Ew.  Why don't I just say  a lope wiser?  I wanted Wobbly Pop  to catch on.  Knowing how much  of a douche  I really am,  I wanted that  to catch on.  I wanted people  to just kind of  walk around New York  pointing at me,  hey,  Wobbly Pop.  You're the Wobbly Pop guy.  Is that like a weird, 
[01:32:00]  I never heard  of that term before.  Is that like saying  I'm going to get a brew?  Like it's just  another word for a beer?  I think brewski.  But it's kind of  like the same vibe?  I never heard Wobbly Pop.  I want a beer.  I like a Wobbly Pop  every once in a while,  especially on a Friday.  I found it funny.  Yeah,  so you'll hear that  ad nauseum  for the next couple of days  because it's going to be hot.  Well,  the best is when  they show the graphic  and they just wax,  you idiot.  The big apple.  Yeah,  it's not the big apple anymore,  it's the baked apple  this weekend.  And there's a fat person  alert today. 
[01:32:30]  Stay clear,  fat people could explode  in the city today.  Very hot.  How hot is it?  That's right,  Opie.  I can't even look at you.  I'm embarrassed.  Who thought this crap  was going to work?  How's wrong with everybody?  All right,  we're almost done.  When did we turn the corner? 
[01:33:00]  When they...  Question is,  when will you?  When they wheeled  in that first case  of Budweiser?  Yeah,  maybe that had something  to do with it.  It's not that bad.  I would love to really  trash it,  but it's like,  eh.  This was before  the big meeting.  It's not that good  either,  though.  This was before  the big meeting  that me and Opie had  when we decided  we were not going  to listen to management.  Remember that?  You've got to also  understand,  we just got fired.  We just blew up  our careers,  so we had to kind of  listen to everybody  around us. 
[01:33:30]  And then we started  realizing,  oh my God,  we're going to be out  of New York radio  within months  if we continue  doing this horse,  you know what.  Horrid radio.  So then we're like,  ah,  we have nothing to lose,  so why don't we use  our real voices again  like we were doing  up there in Worcester?  Here's us talking  about new movies  coming out.  All right.  A couple new movies  out.  What do you got?  Out of Sight,  George Clooney  and Jennifer Lopez.  I love Jennifer Lopez.  I don't.  No,  you don't.  I don't like  Jennifer Lopez. 
[01:34:00]  Once again,  I never liked  Jennifer Lopez.  You're lying.  Because that was  the thing to say.  I always thought  her ass was fucking huge.  Wait a minute.  Easy with the language there.  Sorry.  You're lying again.  Yes.  Yeah.  Her ass was way too big.  I hated Jennifer Lopez.  But I liked the delivery.  Oh,  I love Jennifer Lopez.  A couple new movies out.  What do you got?  Out of Sight, 
[01:34:30]  George Clooney  and Jennifer Lopez.  I love Jennifer Lopez.  I want to stalk her.  She was in town.  I tried to find her,  but no luck.  I have a problem  with Dr. Doolittle,  though.  Yeah,  so do I.  Eddie Murphy's new movie.  Depending on what paper  you read today,  it's not looking good at all.  He's really taking  that Robin Williams tack  where he's just grabbing up  these lame movies.  Right.  Like that.  Right.  I don't know.  Chris Rock is the hamster?  Yeah,  I'm going to go see it  just to see Chris Rock 
[01:35:00]  as the hamster.  We got to get him  on our show again.  I hear he studied.  Do we?  Do we have to get him?  Do we,  you douche?  Do we?  Oh,  we got to get him.  This is awful.  Here's something.  I don't think we ever  had Chris Rock on the show.  No.  I think the first time  he did our show  was when he sat there.  Got to get him on again.  A few months ago.  Yeah,  because,  you know,  we're friends.  He doesn't know  we're back in New York yet.  He probably couldn't 
[01:35:30]  get through on the facts  because all the  NEW legends  were faxing their congrats.  We got to get  a pack of the show,  Jimmy.  This,  Chris Rock,  here it is,  Sean the producer  saying,  Chris Rock is the hamster.  Wow,  that's my requirement  for seeing a movie.  You were so excited.  This is awful.  Holy God.  We got to see Chris Rock  as the hamster.  We got to get him  on our show again.  I hear he studied for that  by hanging out 
[01:36:00]  with Richard Gere.  No.  No,  I didn't do  a Richard Gere  hamster joke.  Ten years ago.  Doesn't matter.  It was hacked  ten years ago.  It's not as bad  as it would be.  It does matter,  Jimmy.  It does matter.  Gives it a little leeway.  Steve from Bayshore  saying,  I can't even take notes  on this crap,  he uses the other word,  for the rundown.  He says he can't even  take notes on this.  It's that awful.  I went back  to the studio  yesterday 
[01:36:30]  and took some pictures  of where we used to sit.  I think they're up  on onaradio.com.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Got to get him  on our show again.  I hear he studied  for that by hanging out  with Richard Gere.  Is that true?  I don't know.  I read that somewhere.  Thanks for the laugh,  O.  Yeah, well.  It needed something.  Yeah, well.  It needed something.  Punch it up for me.  Yeah, I was trying to.  We sure could have used this.  Speaking of Richard Gere, 
[01:37:00]  I haven't seen him  around lately.  Because I'm all about,  I'm all about town.  Ugh.  I hate myself.  You didn't see him  while you were  walking around to work?  No.  When I was in the cab?  Uh, this is the last one  for today.  We can't do anymore.  Thank you.  And then maybe tomorrow  we'll show you  where things did change.  Yeah.  We have to do this tomorrow  because we don't want  to leave them  at this point.  We need some vindication. 
[01:37:30]  We got the Carol Miller tapes  where we just,  where we just slammed everybody.  Everybody.  We finally had it  with everyone.  That was definitely  the turning point.  The turning point  was that,  that big mess  they put together.  Celebrating,  I think,  40 years of,  Oh, you're right.  Of WNEW.  The history of the rock  of New York or something.  They called it the evolution.  Yeah, we called,  we were calling it  the air pollution  of the rock of New York.  It was the evolution  of the rock in New York.  And it was so effed up  because all the other jocks  were playing it, 
[01:38:00]  you know, straight.  Yeah.  Like, you know,  they were really into it  and Anthony and I were like,  this is horse crap.  Yeah, because they were,  they were changing the format.  Right.  And we couldn't understand  why they were celebrating  this format  that they're throwing away.  Right.  Like, it's such a great thing.  Then why are you  throwing it away?  Right.  And then the jocks  just really got pissed  because we weren't  taking it seriously.  Really started hating us.  And, you know,  I'll give her some credit.  Carol Miller was the only one  brave enough to,  you know,  say it to our faces. 
[01:38:30]  The rest were doing it  behind the scenes  and like, you know,  offices and stuff.  Here's the last one for today.  Faxes are spilling out  like crazy.  So far, we're finding  they're not.  Like crazy.  No.  You say that when.  Are you saying  you were lying?  Yes.  Wow.  That never happened back then.  When you hear like  faxes are spilling out  like crazy,  that means the fax machine  probably isn't even on.  There's no paper in it.  Right. 
[01:39:00]  Faxes are spilling out  like crazy.  So far,  we're finding out  that the cops like us.  I like that.  We like that a lot.  I'm a supporter of the police.  We're all supporters  of the police here at NAW.  My first PBA card,  I think.  You,  I mean,  there were times  you would speed.  Right.  I think you got,  you have more speeding tickets  than I've ever gotten.  I got,  yeah,  that's weird  because,  yeah,  that has completely changed.  I got three speeding tickets  in three states  within 10 days.  That's my record. 
[01:39:30]  Are we actually  taking up on this break?  Huh?  Are we actually  retaking up this break now?  What do you mean?  You know,  you started from 10 years ago,  that clip  and now we just talk about it.  Oh,  no,  no,  no,  no,  let it play out.  I think you got,  you have more speeding tickets  than I've ever gotten.  I got four speeding tickets  in a year and a half.  Yes.  That's why I'm glad  I'm back in the New York area  because there's not many.  See,  and I just lied  to everyone out there.  I said three tickets  in 10 days.  Of course you didn't.  I'm just a liar.  That's why I'm glad  to be back. 
[01:40:00]  What?  Did you get three  in 10 days or no?  I don't think  it was a year and a half.  Who knows what to believe?  Are you lying now  or are you?  I don't know.  I don't even know,  Jimmy.  I hope he's just  a compulsive liar.  I don't know.  Who am I?  But it's not a thing.  Why would you lie about that?  It's such an unimportant thing  to lie about.  I don't know.  I just went on live  and said,  no,  I got three speeding tickets  in 10 days  and then we played the tape  from 10 years ago  and I said three speeding tickets  in a year and a half.  That is like,  whoa,  he's out of control. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  How is that out of control?  That's pretty average.  But the way you just said it  may seem like you got the record.  I know the record  stands as such  because I have  three in 10 days.  You even had the states.  Well, you know,  it's funny  because the time zone breakdown.  I don't know if that's true.  Yes.  That's why I'm glad  I'm back in the New York area  because there's not many places  you could speed anymore.  That's true.  So I'm going to be safe  for a while.  Not in downtown.  Right.  But if you want to send  a fax to the pile,  to the pile, 
[01:41:00]  to the big pile,  giant pile,  so many faxes.  I can't even see Anthony anymore.  And he meant  if you want to send a fax  to the pile of crap  that's talking,  meaning the show.  Wow.  10 years ago,  our first show  in New York City.  Oh,  God damn.  God damn.  The disc just got thrown  at E-Rock.  Thanks, E-Rock. 
[01:41:30]  E-Rock,  you've culled  some great stuff for us.  Thank you.  Tomorrow,  the Carol Miller tapes,  which is very different  than what you heard today.  Opie and Anthony.  What's up,  New York?  Go F yourself.  Don't give a cup  about you.  I don't make friends  on the street.  You don't hang out  with rollerblading buds?  No.  I don't find it exciting  that I walk across town  and I beat cabs. 
[01:42:00]  None of that's true.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're in red alert mode,  though.  That is true.  That's all we can say  right now.  Yeah.  Can't play our cards yet,  but no joke.  To the faithful listeners,  we are in red alert mode.  It could get very interesting  in the coming days.  Jim Norton back from L.A.  And you know what?  We got caught up  playing the audio  from 10 years ago. 
[01:42:30]  We forgot to tell  the fine folks out there  that the traveling virus  is coming to the  PNC Bank Arts Center  in Holmdale, New Jersey,  August 2, 2008.  It's looking like  this is the only show  we're doing this summer.  We were thinking about  doing Boston and Buffalo,  but I don't know.  I don't think it's happening.  I think this is it.  We're definitely not doing  anything in the Philly area.  We're definitely not doing  anything out there  on Long Island.  So as far as like,  you know,  the New York area goes,  this is it.  August 2,  PNC Bank Arts Center, 
[01:43:00]  Holmdale, New Jersey,  confirmed comedians.  You got Jim Norton,  Patrice O'Neill,  Bob Kelly,  Rich Voss,  Otto and George  working on two or three  more comics  and a huge special guest.  A huge special guest.  I could say that much.  Are you lying?  Nah,  I don't know.  I'm just going to ask you  that all day.  I don't know.  Are you going to laugh  out of nowhere?  Yeah.  Oh God,  Opie. 
[01:43:30]  Shut up with the laughing.  Here's the headline  for today.  Tomorrow morning,  9 a.m.,  $10 lawn tickets  go on sale  for the  Child and Virus  Comedy Show.  August 2 at the  PNC Bank Arts Center.  $10 lawn tickets  starting tomorrow  at 9 a.m.  through what?  Ticketmaster?  First thousand lawn seats  are $10  and when the thousand  goes,  that's it.  That's it?  That's it.  First come,  first serve. 
[01:44:00]  Laughing.  And we got billboards  going up on  the New Jersey Turnpike  early next week.  Hope that better  than the last years  with that big mess  that you couldn't read.  There's 50 faces on it  and too many names  and it's like,  what are you doing?  Who made this  complicated mess?  I don't understand  billboards in general  because Jimmy just  nailed it.  There's so many  billboards.  I don't have time  to read all this.  I'm going 70 miles  an hour right now.  It takes a very  catchy billboard  for you to read it. 
[01:44:30]  Who's calling you?  Huh?  Jesus.  That's the loudest  thing ever.  It's me from the past  telling me to kill myself.  Yeah, I'll turn this off.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm just wondering  who's calling you  while you're on the air.  No, it's just emails  and text messages  and pings.  Pings.  All right.  What the hell is that?  Bing.  Oh.  Highlights and more info  visit myspace.com  slash virus tour.  But the headline,  $10 long tickets tomorrow. 
[01:45:00]  Through Ticketmaster  for the August 2nd  PNC Bank Art Center show  in Homedale, New Jersey.  Okay?  All right.  We'll have more  on that tomorrow.  And we'll announce  the other comedians  when they officially sign.  We got some biggies  still to be announced.  What else is going on  in the world today?  Well, the predator  is off the air.  It's just like another example  of why Americans  were such a litigious, 
[01:45:30]  we're revolting as people.  And I know I attack lawyers  once in a while.  People are like,  what do you keep  attacking lawyers  for?  They serve a purpose.  You're scum.  Yeah, this is  a prime example  of scummy lawyers  getting rid of something  that is actually  doing some good,  I guess.  And NBC being  basically cowards.  Yeah.  Because, you know,  Chris Hansen  did a great thing.  Chris Hansen.  It was a great show.  To Catch a Predator  was huge in the ratings. 
[01:46:00]  It was fun TV in general.  And a complete deterrent  to pedophiles  because every time  they would,  there's no way  you couldn't be thinking that.  So to me,  it was a great deterrent.  Fun to watch  these guys being shamed.  And this guy in Dallas,  this, what was he,  a lawyer, a cop,  or a prosecutor or something,  obviously gets caught  in a sting  and shoots himself.  Oops.  Good.  Saves the taxpayers money  if that's what he was doing.  And his family,  of course,  too,  instead of realizing  we have a pedophile 
[01:46:30]  in the family.  Yeah, what a ghoul  one of your family members are.  And NBC, like, settled?  What are you doing?  Why would you settle that?  Yeah, what responsibility  does this show have  that this, uh,  this creep  shoots himself?  So what?  Good riddance, I say.  Yeah, that's good.  That's really good  that they put, uh,  first things first.  Like, the fact that  this was deterring people  from, like,  one of the biggest problems  with, like, child molesters  is how they can get  the kids online.  Yep.  And this is a, 
[01:47:00]  like, what a great deterrent.  Arrest,  public humiliation,  your secrets out,  everything you should do  to these savages  they were doing.  And there was always  that element of doubt  in someone's mind.  They would go,  you know,  this house I'm stepping into,  this might be  one of the, uh,  predator houses.  Yep.  But now,  they know.  The show's off the air,  they're not gonna be  doing it anymore.  Now you could go to the house  without a problem.  Another network  should just pick up the show.  Yeah.  Because it's a,  it's a rating success.  Yeah.  That's what I would do.  Absolutely. 
[01:47:30]  Somebody else should just  pick up the show  and do it.  With Chris Hansen  or somebody else.  Uh,  just the idea  that NBC  just,  just,  just collapsed.  Folded.  Folded.  There's real integrity  in your, uh,  in your,  in your, uh,  what,  your news department  or whatever you wanna call it.  Somebody gets a lawsuit  and, uh,  you just cry like a bunch  of little bitches  and fold up your tent.  What's the matter  with you people?  For the first of all,  they should've just fought it.  They shouldn't have settled. 
[01:48:00]  Why give the,  the family any money?  Nothing.  Your friggin',  whatever it is,  relative,  is a pedophile.  How about a subscription  of highlights?  That's what you get  to be reminded  of what your scummy  brother used to like.  It's amazing.  The guy,  if the guy's caught  in a pedophilia sting,  if he's innocent,  he's gonna scream  in the middle of the street.  This is nonsense.  And if he's guilty  and he shoots himself,  good.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Bye.  Oh, nice.  And some lawyer  took the case.  Of course he did.  My,  my clients  have suffered  a grave loss  due to this program,  this irresponsible program.  Oh,  take it off the air.  I blame the executives,  though.  They gotta stop folding.  Yeah.  Fold over everything.  Just say,  look,  you know,  it's unfortunate,  but we were in the right  and we like this show  and it gets us  good ratings 
[01:49:00]  and it also does  a nice service  to the community.  You know,  that's who I really blame.  Until the executives  stop folding,  this crap's gonna  continue happening.  You know?  Ultimately,  in the Texas sting,  a district attorney  in a neighboring county  dropped all charges  against everyone  caught by Dateline.  That's good.  That's good.  So keep worrying  about violent video games  and all this stuff  to protect children  and here's something  that is absolutely 
[01:49:30]  directly affecting  people molesting kids  and where,  where is one politician  screaming about this?  About what,  like when they took  America's most wanted  off the air,  so many cops  and politicians screamed  that because it wasn't  doing well in the ratings  that they put it back on.  Apparently,  many states  that had the predator  households in them  have dropped the charges  against these guys.  You know,  you see some of the  summaries at the end  but it's been a rolling wave  of prosecutors  just flopping.  Entrapment?  Yeah,  pulling all the charges 
[01:50:00]  against these guys  and then yesterday  Supreme Court ruling  which said that  child rapists  cannot be executed  was another ripple  through the system.  Even with that though,  you're gonna think twice  before you try to find  something online  because you see  this is going on.  It's such a deterrent  no matter what ends up  happening with these cases.  We need to rethink  the entrapment  catch-22 in the law.  I mean,  entrapment,  how can you be entrapped 
[01:50:30]  into going to have sex  with like a 13  or 12-year-old?  You can't be  unless that's what  you're gonna do.  Unless that's what  you're gonna do.  Yeah,  that's your motive.  If you show up  at a house  to have sex  with a kid,  how are you entrapped?  I don't get it.  God,  we're a bunch  of dummies.  We're dummies.  Absolutely.  And then that,  yeah,  that ruling  where no death penalty  for child rapists.  Why?  I mean,  why?  That one just  That one  seems to me to be 
[01:51:00]  a great reason  to kill somebody.  Who sleeps the night  after voting against that?  Child rapists.  I understand  there's problems  with people being  found guilty  and they're innocent  and all that crap,  but child rapists?  Yeah,  they say the punishment  is a little too extreme  for the crime.  Really?  Really?  Hmm.  The guy had  sex and sodomized  his eight-year-old  stepdaughter.  That was the case 
[01:51:30]  and they sentenced  him to death.  Apparently,  the Supreme Court  said no.  It's a little too extreme.  Really?  Hmm.  Why don't you ask  the eight-year-old?  How productive  in society  is this guy gonna be?  What kind of danger?  Do you think  that's something  that's cured?  Do you think  that guy could go  through therapy  and be out  and amongst children?  I doubt it.  We got Greg  in New Hampshire.  Greg!  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I gotta disagree with you.  Pedophiles have always 
[01:52:00]  been around  and yes,  the computer  does make it easier  for them to get  in contact with kids,  but don't you think  the parents  really need to be  keeping a more  diligent eye  on their kids?  Sure.  I think  that you're  more for big  government, Jim,  and I don't get you,  Jimmy.  You're like,  as liberal as it gets,  it sounds like,  when I see you live.  One thing at a time.  One thing at a time.  Yeah, go on.  Big government?  How is this  for big government?  What I'm saying,  I like the fact  that there's just  a deterrent out there  to people doing this. 
[01:52:30]  Big government...  The deterrent  is entrapment, Jim.  That's not entrapment,  How is this not  entrapment  if every freaking  prosecutor is flopping  on it right now  because they know  it is.  What I'm saying is  it might be the  legal definition  of entrapment,  but that's why  I said we have  to change that  category.  Why would we...  Hold on,  one thing at a time.  Okay, Jim,  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  They have to change  that clause  because guys  who are showing up,  they're always  contacted first.  They didn't contact  the predators.  So there's a guy  in there pretending  to be a 12-year-old girl.  Somebody contacts him 
[01:53:00]  and they think  they're showing up  at a house  to have sex  with a 12-year-old.  You know what?  If the legal definition  of entrapment  covers that,  then the legal definition  of entrapment  needs to be changed  because if that's what...  Is that what you think  the Constitution's about?  Protecting guys  that show up  to rape kids  or have sex with kids  and bring booze  to have sex with a child?  I think you're attacking  it from the wrong end.  Really?  What's the right end?  Stupid constitutional worshiper?  Jim, listen to me  for a second, please, sir.  I believe that  if you had the parents  become more diligent  on this  and there was parental controls  and they talked  to their kids 
[01:53:30]  about what was going on,  if you're attacking  it from the wrong end, Jim...  Why don't you do both?  Why don't you do both?  Okay, but Jim,  why don't you propose  that we do both?  I just did.  I said change  what is interpreted  as entrapment.  Jim, you're too much  about government  and trying to get them  involved in our lives  at a point  when they're way too involved  in our lives.  Jim, you're being glib.  I'm not being glib.  No, he said me.  But to think  that I'm from big government,  dude, to think  that I'm from big government  because I want  to see pedophiles... 
[01:54:00]  You're always right.  You're so well-informed,  but I'm telling you, Jim...  I am well-informed.  You are one of these...  You think that I'm  from more big government  because I want pedophiles  to not be able  to use an entrapment clause  to get out, you ass?  You think that means  I want the government  knocking on my front door?  Shut up.  Jim, how am I the ass  because the parents  aren't doing their job?  Stop with the whole  parents issue.  This is not about the parents.  They contact them  half the time  pretending they're children,  you dope.  Let me ask you something, Jim.  Do you think there's  a difference between  the way that we were parented? 
[01:54:30]  I'm 43 years old.  I'm a little bit older.  Yes, and here's the difference.  I'll tell you...  Let me finish.  Yes, I'll answer.  There is a difference.  And also growing up,  we didn't have computers  which allowed pedophiles  access to us  while we were sitting  in our own houses.  Unfortunately.  People were molested  in the church.  Was that bad parenting?  I guess so.  I guess all these  parents had sent  their kids to church  who were molested  by priests.  Bad parenting.  I suppose so.  Jim, you're being ridiculous.  Seriously.  No, I'm really not.  Yes, you are, Jim.  If the parents gave a shit,  I'm sorry you'd have to swear. 
[01:55:00]  Hold on.  Then you don't have  to swear, stupid.  You're not paying attention,  Jim.  I'm listening to you.  I'm listening to you.  Okay, Jim.  Seriously, it's on the parents.  It's not on the government  to take care of this.  Seriously.  So then why do we have prison?  Why have prison  if it's up to the parents?  Maybe the kid was asking for it.  Why do we have prison  if it's not up to the parents?  We as a society  have a right to say  we want certain people  put away  and we can do certain things  to do that.  Okay, Jim, whatever.  You're right, I'm wrong.  Yes, you're correct.  Yes, Jim.  We'll just have to agree  to disagree.  No, we don't.  You said it.  I'm right and you're wrong.  You're an M-F-er. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, really?  Oh.  What's the matter, little boy?  You lose the argument.  You're an M-F-er.  You're an M-F-er.  Oh, Jimmy, that's bad.  Are you parenting different?  What about the point  about pedophiles  could not get to you  in your house  when we were growing up?  And no one hates  parents using  everybody else  to raise their kids more.  I hate parents  who talk about their kids too much.  But this is not a case  of parents not doing their jobs.  What a dope.  And even so,  what about parents  not doing their jobs?  There are plenty  of lousy parents out there 
[01:56:00]  so the kid should be raped  because the parent is stupid.  I'm one, believe me,  I hate the protect the children thing  from anything.  I could care less.  But I think Jimmy  gets the point on that one.  The guy was a terrible debater.  To say that I'm  from more big government,  it's like,  how dumb are you?  Hmm. 
[01:56:30]  Welcome back  to Norton, friends.  Hey!  Today my guests  are Greg and Tony,  a couple local guys  making their way back  to the New York area.  I met him  while we were out there.  He was rollerblading  through the park.  We were looking  at some girls.  He was driving  to the camp laughing.  That's right, Jim.  And Traveling Virus,  August 2nd at PNC.  We have a lot  of the same guys.  We're actually working  on other guys too.  You know,  you got myself  and I think Patrice  and Otto and Voss.  Bob Kelly.  Bobby Kelly.  And there's a couple guys  I'm still working on. 
[01:57:00]  And some surprises.  Yeah.  And there's definitely  one stuff.  You're going to be sitting  in the audience  and also we're going  to announce someone  and you're going to go,  wow, who saw that coming?  Yes.  I guarantee at least  one of those.  At least.  $10 lawn seats.  Every year we act  like this is a big mystery.  But $10 lawn seats  are going on sale.  There's only 1,000  that are going to be sold.  They're going on sale  tomorrow morning.  I think at Ticketmaster?  Mm-hmm.  So you can get  your $10 lawn seats.  And we're only doing  the one show this year  because we couldn't get  the venue we wanted  in Boston  because they hate us up there.  Mm-hmm.  Or they hate these two. 
[01:57:30]  They don't hate Jimmy.  Yeah, but they do  by association.  Yeah.  Menino's not like,  bring the kid.  That's too bad.  Yeah, that would have been nice.  And then Buffalo,  we don't know what's going on.  In Buffalo,  I don't know if they're  renewing our contracts.  Why?  I said it.  Don't we do well up there?  I said it.  Don't we do well up there?  We do very well,  but the company's  not doing well,  so they're trying  to lowball us.  Did I just say that?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But that's not  the red alert  we've been talking about 
[01:58:00]  all morning long.  This show is  in red alert mode.  That really bugs me.  About what?  That we're in  red alert mode.  I don't like it.  Yeah, I know.  And we'll give you more info  when we feel like  it's appropriate.  And I got a text  from somebody  just about that last tool  that was,  you're too much government.  Someone said  he's a libertarian  in a text.  I don't know  if that's true or not,  so I'm not going  to bash libertarians.  But if that's what  the libertarian philosophy is, 
[01:58:30]  that that would actually  be government intrusion,  then libertarians stink.  If that's what they are.  If it's not,  then I apologize.  Well, I don't apologize.  I'm just wrong.  Libertarians are into,  you know,  the whole minimal government,  which sounds good.  Yeah.  I like it.  Yeah, I'm sure  when the libertarians  be attacked in the street,  then they're like,  no cops,  because they're  an arm of the government.  They think that  they should just  defend themselves,  or they want the police  when their house is on fire?  No firemen.  At least not paid by...  No state agencies, yeah. 
[01:59:00]  Cool.  Hey, other things happening.  Remember we were playing  the audio of Motley Crue  on Larry King?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  They went back on Larry King  a couple days ago,  and we did a whole set  on Larry King  trying to relate  to, you know,  Motley Crue.  Yeah.  And we're like,  why didn't Motley Crue  call out Larry King  and go,  look, these questions  are really stupid?  Yeah.  Because they are stupid,  and they're embarrassing,  Well, some people  are thinking that  Motley Crue took our advice 
[01:59:30]  because they did  pretty much that  when they talked to  Greta Van Susteren.  Why didn't they do it  with Larry King?  Were they  A-hole buddies with him?  Greta Van Susteren.  Was she talking  on the side of her mouth?  Yeah.  Did her plastic surgery  finally heal?  I haven't seen her in a while.  It hasn't?  Not really settled.  It's still settling?  Yeah.  Her face work?  She had so much work done,  it's just constantly moving. 
[02:00:00]  But why does she need it done?  Like, she's never  going to be hot.  It's like,  all right,  now maybe I'd bang you.  I think that's all  she was going for.  Really?  Is a maybe I'll bang you.  A maybe bang?  Yeah,  because she was  unbangable before.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Well,  this is what went on  on our show.  I love this clip.  And indeed you are.  Well,  I hope that all of you  come back.  We'll be following  how Queen Fest does.  The CD gets released  at midnight tonight,  so everyone  will be the first  to go get it  at midnight. 
[02:00:30]  Thank you.  We have to,  yeah.  We have to.  We were talking earlier,  we don't even have  our own CD.  Everything's so  under lock and key  now with the internet,  so stuff doesn't  get out there.  Hey, Greta.  I think you can get  one.  Yeah.  Greta.  Yes.  What color panties  are you wearing?  Moving along,  gentlemen.  Always nice to see you.  Nikki,  see if you can't  bring some other  friends next time.  Anyway.  Should be flattered.  Who asked her that?  Huh? 
[02:01:00]  What'd you say?  This is one of  Nikki's friends.  Oh,  okay.  What color panties  are you wearing?  You're wearing.  Like they really  want to know.  Greta.  No one wants to know  what color your panties  are.  Why wouldn't she  improv a funny answer?  Yeah,  I don't wear any.  Exactly.  It wouldn't be funny,  but.  That would have been  in the context.  They all would have  broke up laughing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thrown her over the desk  and checked.  Lift that skirt up.  Hold on.  We got Mark in  New Hampshire.  Was that the same guy? 
[02:01:30]  Mark?  No,  I'm not the same guy.  I'm not a moron.  Okay.  Hi.  Okay.  I am,  however,  a libertarian from  New Hampshire,  and I'd like to.  So Mark,  when you were in  that limo with  Obama in  Gurney,  Illinois,  same voice for  people that linger longer.  Mark,  what do you got?  That one hurts.  Yeah.  No,  I'd just like to clarify  what the libertarians  stand for.  Did that guy sound like  a libertarian,  Mark,  or no?  I don't know.  He kind of did, 
[02:02:00]  but he sounded like  a real extreme libertarian.  Okay.  What we're wary of  is big government  getting involved  in people's lives,  but I understand  there's times  like pedophiles  trying to get at  our kids on computers  where it should be allowed,  but I mean,  there's states right now  where what they want  to do is put  black boxes in cars  like they do  in airplanes,  and then whenever  you go over  the speed limit,  your car sends  a notice to the police,  and they just mail  you a ticket.  I like that.  Oh, wait, no.  I hate that.  I mean,  you would, 
[02:02:30]  but it's things like that  that we're wary of,  and we just look at things  like the government  monitoring computers  and things like that  as a step in that direction  and where it's going to end.  As much as I,  believe me,  I hate the idea  of that black box  going in the car,  but just to play  devil's advocate,  if it's something  being used  to enforce a law  that is,  like if you don't  break a law,  there will never  be a notice sent,  and I don't want it, 
[02:03:00]  believe me,  but I'm saying  where is that  an intrusion  when it is simply  enforcing a law  that's in place?  Well,  that's the question,  and I can't answer it,  but what,  you know,  the question is  where do you draw  that line on how far  the government  is allowed to interfere  in our lives  to do things like that?  I think most of the  population would be  in outrage  if they did put  black boxes  into cars like that  and kind of putting  a black box  into a computer, 
[02:03:30]  you know,  a lot more people  might be in favor of,  but what the libertarians  believe,  you know,  we're definitely not  pro-pedophile  or anything like that,  but what we do believe  is that the government  needs to be regulated  and it's getting,  you know,  out of control.  Well,  I think,  if that,  fair enough,  I mean,  but I think that that's,  to me,  so the libertarians  are just like misusing  what government  interference is.  That's almost like saying,  do they not believe  in undercover operations  to catch criminals  or drug dealers?  Like,  are they against  mafia infiltration  by undercover agents? 
[02:04:00]  Because this is basically  the equivalent  of an undercover operation,  so they're against that?  Well,  you're talking about  Jimmy's entrapment  and the libertarians  don't have a specific  view on entrapment  where,  you know,  if it's a legal tool,  you know,  of law enforcement  and it's been approved  by the Supreme Court,  then fine.  But we just believe  that,  you know,  that the government,  what it really is all about  is big taxes  and more government  to the power  and things like that.  But,  just not to interrupt you,  but should that be  entrapment though?  Like,  I agree with certain 
[02:04:30]  entrapment things,  but isn't that entrapment  in the mafia too  or anything?  You're pretending  to be somebody you're not.  You're not being truthful  telling that guy  he's talking to a police officer  who's undercover  with a wire.  So,  I mean,  when entrapment  gets looked at like that,  to me,  it just seems like  it's another  disgusting legal angle  that criminals are using  to get out of being prosecuted.  It's not like  a legitimate case  of where you're in the middle  of having sex with a girl  and she yells,  I'm a cop  and,  you know,  you're cheating on your wife.  I mean,  to me,  that's entrapment. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah,  no,  I agree with you.  It's not a great example  and I agree that,  you know,  I agree that entrapment  should be allowed  in cases like that  and I don't necessarily,  it's two different issues.  I really was just calling  to defend the libertarian angle  and let it be known  that we're not  anti-laws  and things like that,  that we're more about  small government  and government regulation  and government control.  I just didn't want  that guy going on the air  and telling all your listeners  that, you know,  the libertarian party  is not about enforcing laws  because that's not  what we're about. 
[02:05:30]  And I know he would go,  but it's about good parents,  but it's like,  we were talking before,  this is not a,  I hate when parents  expect the rest of us  to do their jobs,  but that's a case  where,  it's like Ann said,  you are kind of punishing  kids in a way,  it's silly,  and to me,  it's a very,  it's a fair thing  to say we would like  the government  to be able  to use the tax money  we pay  to catch guys  that are trying  to have sex with children.  Yeah,  I agree with you.  What you said was great  when we had to do,  you know,  both things, 
[02:06:00]  stop it at home  and stop it,  you know,  with the law,  and why should the kid  get punished  and get raped  because the parent's  not doing the job?  That was a great point.  I don't know how  we can argue with that.  Yeah,  I mean,  if the government's  in every aspect of our lives  trying to catch  every time you cheat  on your taxes  or every time you  play your music to it,  I mean,  go over the speed limit.  Yes,  that's government intrusion.  There's no common sense  being used anymore.  It's got to be some  just legal,  a mumbo jumbo,  if I may use the word,  that has to stick  to this strict line. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  You know,  there's no gray area  where common sense  has to come into it.  When that guy told me  I'm from more big government,  it's like,  then you obviously,  what are you,  nuts?  Yeah.  More big government.  I want gay people  to be able to get married,  do what they want.  I want people out of their lives.  I don't want to get married.  Oh,  okay.  But I'm saying,  I don't want big government.  I don't want people  controlling what other people do.  All right,  Mark.  Thank you for calling,  all right?  Bye.  Someone was saying  that Anthony is a libertarian.  Adam in Boston,  listening on BCN.  Adam? 
[02:07:00]  Hey,  boys.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Thank you,  sir.  real quick.  I think Marx is kind of  overcomplicating,  like pure libertarianism  and like,  I'm not the extreme  moron that's called first,  but like,  I'd say ant to the libertarian,  like small government,  don't pay too much in taxes,  like protect people  and their stuff,  but gun ownership  is cool.  Like,  drug use is cool  as long as you're not  breaking into people's houses  and taking their money  to buy drugs.  Like,  that's the heart  of libertarianism.  Strong police force,  strong military,  but not all the social programs 
[02:07:30]  and crap that gets paid  for with our taxes.  That's about it.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Who would,  but for someone  to not use common sense  and like,  as we're having that point,  to actually think  that using people  to catch computer predators  who are at times  themselves acting like kids  and to go,  what about parenting?  It's like what you are  is you're a dummy  just engaging in rhetoric  and you're not using  common sense.  You're just saying that  because you think  you're supposed to say that  because you're stupid.  I agree with you  100% on that, Jimmy. 
[02:08:00]  Thank you.  All right, let's go to...  I'm sorry I have to curse.  Yeah, let's go to Mike  in New York.  Mike.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, how you doing?  Listen,  they're talking about  the definition of entrapment.  In New York State penal law,  they say that entrapment  is when you force somebody  to do something  that they normally wouldn't do.  Okay.  I hear the pedophile  is planning this,  so he's doing it anyway.  So it's not entrapment  by sending an undercover in.  Yeah, I don't know why  the people...  He said,  why are those prosecutors  all dropping the cases? 
[02:08:30]  I really don't know.  I don't know if Dateline  did something wrong.  I don't care.  And the legal angle about it  is not even that big a deal  when compared to  the public humiliation.  Yeah.  Because most of these guys  won't do a hard jail time anyway.  Mm-hmm.  So, yeah, all right.  Well, it's the legal  definition of entrapment.  They were not entrapping them.  Let's say hi to Dave.  Dave, you're on  the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, yes.  Hello.  Hey, Dave.  Oh, yeah.  I'd like to make comments  on the entrapment law.  I mean, entrapment 
[02:09:00]  is entrapment  as, you know,  no matter how you look at it.  I understand that  if they're going to,  if they're using it  to infiltrate the mafia  or something,  they're doing the right thing.  But at the same time,  they should not  be able to twist it  to their advantage.  Entrapment should be  entrapment  no matter how you look at it.  So, but what do you mean?  I'm not sure what you're saying.  Like, if they never  contact the kid first,  don't you think  the definition of entrapment  then should be changed?  I'm just talking  about entrapment in general.  As far as the pedophiles go,  listen, I'm talking 
[02:09:30]  to a person,  I'm 40 years old,  I have 11 years  inside of prison  because I was a moron  when I was younger.  But as far as pedophiles go,  okay, fine.  If people want to argue  about it,  it's too rough to kill them,  then you know  what they should do,  which I actually think  would be an even better punishment?  Sentence them to life  in prison  but in solitary confinement.  I did three years  in solitary confinement  and that will kill you  from the inside out.  What did you do, sir?  Well, I was a moron.  I was always fighting  when I was younger.  I was, like every other teenager,  I sold drugs  or whatever the case may be. 
[02:10:00]  All right.  So, but entrapment is,  again, I have more,  I'm more willing  to listen to a drug charge  entrapment  from somebody  who's selling drugs  because that's to me  less of a heinous thing  than going to, like,  a kid's house  to have sex with them  and bring booze.  I agree with that.  But again, again,  like I said,  it's like the meaning  of the word entrapment  has one meaning.  It shouldn't have  a certain meaning  for certain situations  and another meaning  for certain situations  Well, don't forget, though, 
[02:10:30]  legally things have  different meanings  because you have  murder one,  murder two.  You know what I mean?  Just because somebody  winds up dead  doesn't mean that  it was an automatic homicide.  And, you know,  there's different things  bend a little.  All right, let's go to Rick  really fast.  We're running out of show.  Rick, you're the last caller  today from Ohio.  Good morning to Cleveland,  by the way.  What's up, Rick?  Good morning.  I just want to explain  to Jimmy the reason  these guys are getting up  and calling entrapment  is because  the 12-year-old girl  doesn't exist.  If you do an undercover  sting with the mafia, 
[02:11:00]  they're actually seeing  laws be broken.  Okay.  So basically they're saying  because they're contacting  someone who never was  a 12-year-old girl.  That's not true either.  Because drugs,  you can buy fake drugs  and think that you're  buying real drugs  and they still get you.  And you're not supposed  to be carrying on  a conversation like that  on the internet.  It doesn't even matter  that you're visiting the house.  They could bust you  without even going  to the house.  Thank you. 
[02:11:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's M202.  In the world of Radio Shock,  the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things  that border on offensive  in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here  and think that radio  has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio  out of any other medium  have to be nice? 
[02:12:00]  We are being now held  to a standard  where we have to be nice  and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys,  Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities,  Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs,  Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts,  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jots,  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jots,  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Talk talk.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Talk talk.  Opie and Anthony.  Talk talk.  Opie and Anthony.  Talk talk.  Opie and Anthony.  Talk talk.  Paris,  you were strip searched.  Was the search  of something we like  to call the old two-hander? 
[02:12:30]  Whoa, man.  Did they do the old  grip and rip?  This is where  Heyman is going.  What is that?  Um, extreme camel toe.  Ew.  Oh, God damn.  Ew.  Oh, God,  you got a complete camel toe.  Opie and Anthony.  If you are here,  give us a sign.  Oh, boy.  My wallet is gone.  Oh, my God.  It's with us  beyond the grave.  It's time for people  to understand  these are words.  If you don't like them, 
[02:13:00]  turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show  on the road.  It's the Opie and Anthony show  live from XM Satellite Radio.  Hi.  Got guys on the bleachers today.  Nice.  Yep.  That's what happens  as the week goes on.  You get more people.  As the week goes on,  the crowd builds, yes.  Friday turns into a  live show party.  We throw the bleachers  in studio  and then we're shy  to broadcast in front of  everybody.  I get shy. 
[02:13:30]  Hey, um.  Problem?  Problem?  He just took a swig of water  and...  Tastes sugary  because what do they spray  on these microphones  that my lip hit?  Lysol.  Lysol in water?  Mmm.  Nice.  Tasty.  Okay.  Ugh.  Can I have a pen?  Uh, no you can't, Jimmy.  Yeah, you can have a pen.  The interns should be doing this.  Get a chewed up Earl pen.  We're gonna start with this.  Uh, we've been looking back  at our first show  in... 
[02:14:00]  Shit.  ...New York City.  Mm-hmm.  Ten years ago.  We played every clip  except for one.  Now, why?  We weren't allowed to play, uh,  this clip over there.  Even though it originally  happened on regular radio.  Why is that?  Because there was an Asian thing.  Oh.  Oh my fucking God.  Oh my fucking God.  I thought the horror was over.  So we have one more clip  to play for everybody.  No.  Yeah, I didn't want to tell you  over there, Jimmy, 
[02:14:30]  because I knew you would  lose your mind.  I really wouldn't, though.  No, it's not...  It's just ridiculous.  It is what it is.  Stop already.  It is what it is.  It goes with the whole thing  we were talking about  with the catch a predator  and, you know,  executives just folding  like tents left and right.  They gotta stop folding  to these special interest groups  and then we could go back  to doing what we know...  Uh...  Go back to doing what we know...  How to do.  How to do.  Right.  Sure.  It'll never change, though,  because they're just cowards.  That's why they're on the outside  doing what they do.  Yep.  Well, the X-Amers get a bonus track. 
[02:15:00]  Bonus track.  Bonus track.  Ten years ago,  Anthony and I did our first show  in New York City,  played just about all these clips earlier.  We have one more to play.  Anthony doing his President Clinton  impression.  He's on the phone  making believe  he's calling from China.  What?  And we were not allowed  to play this on regular radio today.  Why was I doing that?  Thanks to JV and Elvis.  No, not JV.  And we love JV and Elvis.  I'm just joking. 
[02:15:30]  Those guys, like,  should never have been fired.  They did some Asian humor.  Special interest group got involved,  so the company just folded  and fired those guys.  Because it was Carolla  that started it with CBS.  Right.  Because he was the one  that got in trouble.  And then instead of telling  these fucking,  these special agents,  just go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Because the advertisers  are always cowards.  Right.  They're product whores.  Ugh, I hate everybody  except myself.  So even though this happened  ten years ago  and there was not  a blip of controversy, 
[02:16:00]  why was I calling it?  We weren't allowed to  replay it this morning  because any type of Asian humor  is off limits.  That's President Clinton.  Because he was in China.  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  Ten years ago.  Speaking of perversion,  as you were earlier, Opie.  No, I wasn't speaking  of perversion.  Give us a couple weeks  before we start  speaking of perversion.  President Clinton.  Yes.  In his search for,  I guess,  fortune cookie nookie  is in.  No, I didn't say that. 
[02:16:30]  I didn't fucking say that.  No, it sucks.  I didn't.  Jimmy, you heard something wrong.  I didn't say that.  We get to look at douche chills.  I've never looked  at douche chills before.  Yeah.  But there's five or six,  I don't know,  people on the bleachers today  and I'm looking at douche chills.  They're in shock out there.  Why?  That was a good line.  Huh?  It rhymes and stuff.  Shitty.  It was horrid.  Speaking of, 
[02:17:00]  fortune cookie nookie.  Speaking of perversion,  as you were earlier, Opie.  No, I wasn't speaking  of perversion.  Give us a couple weeks  before we start  speaking of perversion.  President Clinton.  Yes.  In his search for,  I guess,  fortune cookie nookie  is in China.  Hey, Opie found it funny.  Huh?  You found it funny.  Oh, you were lying again.  Yeah.  Shit.  I knew it.  Yeah.  Just feeling,  feeling good.  You know.  Just keep laughing 
[02:17:30]  to keep the bit going.  That's me.  You don't think  I don't know?  Idiots.  Shut up.  Kenster.  Good timing  with that rapid fire line,  Ant.  Hey, fuck.  What?  You wanted to know  about some fortune  cookie nookie?  Yeah, it rhymed.  So much fortune cookie nookie.  Jimmy loves this.  I certainly do.  Too bad you want  to watch a Star Wars  because then maybe  the Wookiee wanted  some fortune cookie nookie.  You suck.  You suck. 
[02:18:00]  Were you guys  gambling after too  because maybe  the Wookiee  who's a bookie  wanted some fortune  cookie nookie.  All right.  Let's just sit  until Jim gets this  out of his system.  I'm running  through the outback.  There's no such thing  as a zookie.  You already used cookie.  A xylophone?  No.  A yucky?  No.  Yeah, yucky.  Is in China.  Much to the chagrin  of a lot of his critics  because he's going  to actually be 
[02:18:30]  visiting Tiananmen Square  on the site  of that uprising  in 89.  Yes.  That the Chinese  really kind of  massacred some people there.  But he's going to go there  for a big ceremony.  I think he's there  already actually, dude.  Not in Tiananmen Square.  He's in China though.  All right.  And a couple of questions.  I just wish we could  contact him.  I've got a question  I'd love to ask him.  Gee, I wonder.  Here comes the  awkward transition.  Yeah.  And ladies and gentlemen,  you're about to hear  the awkward transition. 
[02:19:00]  Bring on the bit.  As we bring on the bit.  Oh, God.  We don't know how to  seg into the bit.  All right.  And a couple of questions.  I just wish we could  contact him.  I've got a question  I'd love to ask him.  Well, what a coincidence.  What, Opie?  I thought it was...  Guys, just go home.  I can't.  You guys are setting up.  No, just tell him to go home.  I can't.  There's really nothing  to see here.  Just go home. 
[02:19:30]  Put it back up.  Let's give it another lookie.  Oh, my God.  This is horrible.  I don't think I've heard  Anthony say chagrin  since 1998.  Why would he say chagrin?  What is he, a rookie?  Fucking gum under this thing.  It's all googie.  Fortune cookie noogie.  Nah, that's kind of cute. 
[02:20:00]  What was I thinking?  I don't know.  And I'd love to ask him.  Well, what a coincidence.  What, Opie?  I thought it was going to take  six to eight months  before we had some  high-profile celebrities  on our show.  Why am I trying to sell this  like we're actually  going to talk to Clinton?  Scott from Hoppock.  Oh, lookie, lookie.  Bill Clinton was also  playing hookie.  Oh, hookie.  God damn it.  Hookie, yeah.  Well, what a coincidence.  Before we had some 
[02:20:30]  high-profile celebrities  on our show.  Don't tell me  you've actually got  the president on the phone.  I sure do, Anthony.  Hey, President Clinton.  Hello, Opie.  Hello, Anthony.  What's going on?  You're in China, I hear.  I'm here in China  spreading goodwill.  Now, I got a problem  with this.  What's the problem?  There's not a lot of people  in China that speak English.  So how are you  communicating with the people?  Well, I'm going to have  a Chinese interpreter  that I take with me.  His name is Dong. 
[02:21:00]  Wait a minute.  No, no.  His name isn't...  Hold on.  I like that joke.  Jimmy.  It's a funny...  Jimmy.  Shut up.  I want to point out  why I like it.  It's a funny name,  but it kind of sounds  like a penis in our life.  And something tells me  there's going to be  a little misunderstanding.  A little double entendre.  Wow.  This is going to be  like a Three's Company episode.  It sure is.  Are we heading down  the double entendre roll?  Yes.  Jimmy gets...  He kicks back in his chair. 
[02:21:30]  He's holding the mic in his hand  and just waiting to pounce.  Right now,  I'm a little wounded gazelle  at the water hall.  Yeah.  And Jimmy is a tiger.  This is going to be  the Three's Company episode  when it was eight rolls  and he grabbed his chest  and did the old nose  to the floor  behind the fucking sofa.  Let's say hi to Mike  on Long Island.  Hello, Mike.  Mike.  How are you doing?  In news today,  Chewbacca got signed  to a new team  and he's got a gambling problem 
[02:22:00]  and he loves aging hookers.  And the news read  that the Wookiee Rookie  hid from his bookie  while searching  for Fortune Cookie Mookie.  How are you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah, I could see that happen.  Oh, this is nice.  Yeah.  Ah, some support  from my sister Dawn.  Oh, that's good  because I turned off my phone.  She writes,  I'm shutting you off now.  Ew, this is worse  than hearing you talk  about your sex life. 
[02:22:30]  Thanks.  Gabe from Staten Island.  Jimmy, I think  you might have missed one.  This bit is a steaming pile  of dookie.  Nice, that doesn't count.  That's dookie.  It's dookie.  Dookie.  No.  Nothing?  No.  He's wrong.  Oh, man, what?  Nope.  Watching dookie milky.  Opie is so excited  during this bit.  Did he make comesies? 
[02:23:00]  Well, I'm going to have  a Chinese interpreter  that I take with me.  His name is Dong.  Wait a minute.  Your Chinese interpreter,  his name is Dong?  Yes, my Dong.  His name is my Chinese interpreter.  I wouldn't dream of coming to China  without my Dong.  Come on.  Yes, the Chinese people.  Come on.  Come on.  My Dong.  See.  Is the interpreter. 
[02:23:30]  See?  My favorite part so far  is him going,  Come on.  Come on.  Like, quit razzing me.  Stop.  It isn't really my Dong,  is it?  Come on.  You're pulling my leg.  President Clinton,  is it really my Dong?  And this is why  we do not write bits.  This is the genius stuff  that people just loved.  Well, it was our first show.  We got better.  Well, my Dong.  He never goes anywhere  without my Dong.  Without my Dong  because he needs  also known as 
[02:24:00]  his cock.  Right.  See?  It's a subtle way of saying  he takes his cock with him  to fuck women.  Are we going to have  more cock jokes, you think?  I think some my Dong  is going to get into  some adventures.  If the guy's name was Chin Wah,  it wouldn't have been as funny.  No.  It wouldn't have made any sense.  I think my Dong  is going to get into  some cunts.  Oh, my Dong.  Come on. 
[02:24:30]  Yes, the Chinese people  will know what I'm about  through my Dong.  Now, President Clinton,  will this interpreter  be helping you  with any policy makings  over there in China?  No, no.  He's strictly an interpreter.  As soon as my Dong  starts thinking for me,  that's when I get in trouble.  I see.  Okay.  Some people say  that there's a better choice  of interpreters out there,  but I got to tell you,  I stand behind my Dong. 
[02:25:00]  All right, Mr. Clay.  This innocent bit.  Yeah.  Oh, the whole country  should be fucking firebombed.  What's wrong with,  you know,  my Dong?  Fucking A.  Yeah, there's no Asian accent.  Oh, it's so fucking ridiculous.  All right, Mr. Clinton,  we'll let you go, okay?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Have fun in China 
[02:25:30]  with your Dong.  God bless you.  Okay.  Wow.  And there he goes,  the president himself.  Is that an exclusive?  I do believe  no other radio station  is talking to the president  right now.  Boy, you two are just pleased  as punch with yourselves,  aren't you?  After a bit like that,  why wouldn't we be?  Hey, for 1998,  that was radio gold,  my friend.  For 1910,  that wasn't radio gold.  You two kicked your feet up.  Let's celebrate that home run.  And why did Opie say  have fun with your Dong? 
[02:26:00]  You said your Dong,  you should have said my Dong  because that's his name.  Yeah.  If you say your Dong,  now you're implying  that he was talking  about his dick.  Well.  I never realized  that glaring error  ruined the bit.  Thanks for making me feel.  That bit would have been  really funny.  Thanks for making me feel  even better about myself.  Horrible.  Did you get it?  Did anyone get it?  Or did we need  some more fucking  cock jokes put in there?  We needed a ta-da! 
[02:26:30]  Kyle S.  from Indiana writes,  I've never been  more embarrassed  in my life.  Yeah.  Ten years ago,  O&A never went anywhere  without me douche chills.  Scott M.  Hopwog.  Look at this.  Jill N.  is writing,  lose my number.  Let's say hi to  Greg,  West Virginia.  Greg?  Greg?  Hey,  Greg. 
[02:27:00]  Was it day one or two  that you realized  you had to team up  with old Martin and Lewis?  All right.  See,  it's not so easy,  is it?  Let's say hi to  Striker.  Striker.  Striker?  Hey,  Anthony,  I suspect after that bit,  you'll be suffering  from a lack of nookie  from your pookie,  pookie,  pookie,  pookie.  You stumbled a bit,  didn't you?  Look at all you people.  It's so easy.  It's so easy to do, 
[02:27:30]  isn't it?  Let's say hi to  John,  North Carolina.  Hey,  guys.  Hey,  maybe you should  just leave the show  today and play  hookie.  Well,  you know.  If that wasn't used  three times already,  it might have gotten  a chuckle.  Ah,  boy,  this radio thing,  well,  it's just a snap,  isn't it,  callers?  We're seconds away  from fighting back.  It was just awful.  We allowed ourselves  to be thrown under  the bus today.  You do understand that. 
[02:28:00]  Of course.  All right,  we're going to boop.  I have a big announcement.  No,  you don't.  That Louis C.K.  is doing Unmasked.  Yeah,  Friday.  Oh,  you have no?  Yeah,  he called yesterday.  June 27.  You can get tickets  live at xmradio.com,  but you have to put  Louis C.K.  in the subject line.  Yeah.  And he'll be on  tomorrow morning  with Method Man.  Yeah,  Method Man from The Wire.  I'm very happy.  Jeez,  right?  Yeah,  jeez.  He was a lucky  Louis fan too,  so he'll probably  be happy to Louis be in.  I hope he's cool.  Oh,  yeah,  he's great.  I've talked to him.  He's fucking really cool.  Method Man's cool? 
[02:28:30]  He's really cool.  Awesome.  Yeah,  yeah,  he's not forward to that.  All right,  we're going to move on  to other things.  We got breaking news today.  Unbelievable.  Breaking news about  construction workers.  This is just  going to set the country  in a tizzy.  Is it Opie?  Yes.  It has been a horrible year  for construction accidents  in the city.  Tonight,  a CBS2 hidden camera  investigation exposes  construction workers  having a liquid lunch  and then heading back  to work,  putting everyone around  the fucking douchebags. 
[02:29:00]  That's news.  The fucking news.  Construction workers  douchebags.  And that's news?  We had obviously  a very tragic thing  happen here in New York.  One of those cranes fell.  Two people died?  Or one person died?  I think it was just  the operator.  Just the operator died,  but it was just  completely tragic.  The construction workers  are on the scene  crying their eyes out.  So what does the news do?  Let's catch them  drinking at lunch.  Drink.  Go fuck yourselves.  You know how many buildings  they're building in this city?  Bunch of drunks are building.  And there's rarely an accident? 
[02:29:30]  That's news?  Fuck you.  I used to drink  all the time on the job.  Yeah.  You go out for lunch.  You go to the titty bar,  grab a couple of beers,  come back,  a little buzz on,  grab some power tools.  Basically,  they're spinning this like,  say,  if they're not drinking  at lunch,  then there wouldn't be,  you know,  crane accidents.  Fuck you.  Fucking news.  Workers having a liquid lunch  and heading back to work,  putting everyone around them  at risk.  It's like everyone around them.  Go fuck yourselves. 
[02:30:00]  Go fuck yourselves.  Everyone at risk.  Everyone.  You can't even count  how many cranes  are currently in New York  building shit.  Amazing.  It's unbelievable.  They fall down.  Occasionally shit happens.  Everyone around them  at risk.  It's like any happy hour  at this New York City  watering hole,  except it's noon,  and these construction workers  still have to go back to work,  building a sky-high condo complex  on the Upper West Side. 
[02:30:30]  They're not in the right  state of mind.  Only God knows  what can possibly happen.  I am certainly distressed  to hear that they're drinking.  Who the fuck  did no construction workers  drink?  Listen,  I can see if they were  fucking heart surgeons.  Yeah.  They've been drinking forever.  How long do you get a guy  to walk 600 feet in the air  with fucking rivets?  Right.  Rivets.  What year is this?  Have an egg salad.  Rivets and catcher's mitts.  Yeah,  they're catching flaming rivets. 
[02:31:00]  You ever see that  fucking footage  from the old days?  Yeah.  Yeah,  they heat up the rivets  and the guy has to catch it  with a catcher's mitt.  Or a bucket or something.  He's 200,  300 feet off the ground.  Easy.  They use those big  plier thingies  and put it in the hole  and they're like,  unbelievable.  Who the fuck  didn't know they drank?  Fucking assholes.  The stupid  man on the street  crap too.  Are you in danger?  Are you really?  You would think 
[02:31:30]  safety would be  a top priority,  but in a hidden camera,  investigation,  we found construction  workers knocking back  cocktails as many  as six and a half hour.  Construction workers  at a half hour.  On the menu day.  How many in a half hour?  Six?  That's almost impossible.  Nice.  Yeah,  but the guy knows  he can handle it.  I don't think there's  a foreman going,  ah.  You just keep  wobbling around up there.  Yeah.  I think they're taking  notice.  As many as six  and a half hour. 
[02:32:00]  On the menu day one,  beer after beer.  Then,  Day two,  bottoms up again,  despite workers  obviously knowing better.  Day three,  four,  and five,  the party continues.  And when the boss  calls,  listen to what this  worker tells him  over a beer.  I just come here  and have my sandwich  and a Coke.  This is not the first time  we've exposed  this dangerous behavior.  In February of 2007,  we found construction  crews on lunch break 
[02:32:30]  from Midtown's  Bank of America building  hitting the bars too.  Judgment is one  of the first things  that tends to go  when you are drinking.  Oh my God.  Construction safety expert  Kevin Begley says  this behavior  is nothing new,  but it should  absolutely not  be tolerated.  If construction workers  had one ounce  of integrity,  every time  you saw a news person  you'd punch them  in the face.  Trump.  I completely agree,  Jimmy.  You guys,  every time  you see one 
[02:33:00]  of those news vans  you should walk  up to the window  and punch them  in the face.  A lot of people  lose your jobs,  but in the end  they'll stop it.  They'll stop  their bullshit.  Judgment is one  of the first things  to go.  The fucking news  is reporting this.  Yeah.  Like it's news.  Yeah.  How many of those  how many of those  news people  are knocking  them back?  Yeah.  They weren't as vehement  when Sue Simmons  was being accused.  Where was the fucking  hidden camera  to catch Sue Simmons?  Right.  After they were saying 
[02:33:30]  that she likes  to have a few belts.  Right.  And what they're  applying,  but they're just  not brave enough  to go the distance  that that crane accident  here in New York  was caused  because they were  drinking at lunch.  That's basically  what they want  to tell everybody,  but they're not  brave enough  to do that.  Bad weld job  or something.  Right.  Had nothing to do  with someone  maybe having  a few pops  at fucking lunch.  A few wobbly pops?  A wobbly. 
[02:34:00]  I just cannot get over  the horrid.  So a wobbly pops,  what do you think  is wrong with it?  Oh, am I having  a few wobbly pops?  Another catchphrase  from the Opster.  Wasn't that a common?  That didn't hit.  Was that a common one  or is that yours?  No, that wasn't  a common one.  Honestly, I'm sure  I heard that somewhere  and decided,  ah, I think I could  make something with this.  Like everybody  toasting their wobbly pops?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, another wobbly pop,  please.  Who would say that?  I was looking at...  A douche.  I was looking forward  to the t-shirt. 
[02:34:30]  Enjoy a wobbly pop  as you listen to O&A.  Wobbly pop?  Who would enjoy  a wobbly pop?  Unless it was  your Alzheimer's grandfather  and he was holding  a squalding pot of coffee.  Then a wobbly pop  and his sore hand tops  would be hilarious.  My wrists are burned.  I know they are pop-pop.  Wobbly pop.  What do they say  about wobbly pops?  Any beverage  that contains alcohol  for the purpose  of human consumption  and is referred to 
[02:35:00]  by a person  from Newfoundland.  Newfies use that one?  Newfies.  Newfies.  Any bottled  alcoholic beverage  that knocks you  on your ass  is called a wobbly pop.  This is according  to the Urban Dictionary.  First coined  in 1998  by a shock jock name.  I think you're sure  that's it.  Wobbly pop.  I'm not feeling  too well right now  because I had  way too many  wobbly pops  last night. 
[02:35:30]  Who says that?  Newfoundlands.  Fucking Newfoundlers.  Newfoundlanders.  They just showed  Bill Clinton  on the news there.  I didn't see  his interpreter though.  My Dong.  Oof.  Oof is right.  Fucking.  Just oof.  I don't think  I'm going to go  take a wobbly poop.  I hope people  are appreciating  the look down  memory lane  because it really  depresses me.  Later on  I'll be depressed. 
[02:36:00]  Why?  Just because  it's just so douchey  and awful.  Don't be depressed.  Just have yourself  a wobbly pop  and get in trouble.  Maybe some  fortune cookie  nookie.  I didn't say that.  You guys want  more breaking news?  I do.  Oh they're also  blowing up  your spot Jimmy.  Craigslist.  Of course.  What's going on there?  Well we could do  this one too  but there's another  one that is very  similar to the  construction worker  story.  What's the problem?  Alright yeah.  I'm talking Jimmy. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  I want a wobbly  call 45.  Otto told me  all my characters  stink.  We love your  characters.  A wobbly  I don't know  my pop.  We're in  red alert mode  by the way.  Red alert mode.  Yes.  Yeah.  Your pals are  more charitable  than you realize.  Whatever that's worth.  We're way more  charitable than  you realize.  Here's what's  going on with  Craigslist.  Would you ask 
[02:37:00]  someone out by  saying it's your  ticket to paradise  or I want it  and want you  to give it to me  or even feel  the heat of  this Asian lady?  Maybe not  but they're all  just...  Maybe not.  I hate all  news people.  I really do.  Well,  except for a certain  traffic vixen.  Not all bad.  I hate them all  man.  They're all...  Maybe not  but they're all  just a sampling  of the non-traditional  dates offered  in the New York  erotic section 
[02:37:30]  of Craigslist.  85% of the ads  that we looked at  are seemingly  for prostitution  or for illegal  acts.  85% of the ads.  Council member  Eric Goya  has only observed  the content  of the ads  not done a full  on sting  but argues that  it's pretty obvious  the services offered  are indeed  prostitution.  The internet  has become like  the wild west.  What used to  happen on city  street corners  and in brothels  has now moved  to the internet.  Yeah, so it's  out of the streets  you fucking asshole. 
[02:38:00]  It's hot blocker.  It's right there  in the homes  of people  that want it.  What a fucking  cock blocker.  The more guys  like this  that get caught  the more of these  family value  or anyone  fucking with hookers  like Spitzer.  Jimmy makes  a great point.  You're not  going to stop  prostitution ever  so what the internet  has allowed  is for it to be  pretty much  hidden.  Yeah.  You're not seeing  guys walking  into fucking  brothels  and all that shit.  Street walkers.  You're not seeing  the street walkers.  You're not seeing  the pimps. 
[02:38:30]  The internet  pretty much  cleaned up  prostitution.  It cleaned it up.  Yep.  You go online  you make friends.  Make friends.  But fucking  this asshole  85%.  Make some  rollerblading  buddies.  Shut up.  I can't help it.  I'm not beating you up.  I can't help it.  I'm not beating you up.  It's just awful.  Please do.  I want to be hit.  Why don't you  want to go on  a fucking Craigslist  and get yourself  a little fucking  FCN?  What the fuck's  the problem?  What's FCN, Jim?  I'm watching  Cookie Nookie. 
[02:39:00]  Of course it is.  Instead of a GFE  you want some FCN.  The old FCN.  FCN.  At least you're  laughing in the  right places today,  I guess.  Fucker.  All right.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  Believe me.  It's not even going.  I agree with  all of the...  Hey, what do you  think this summer's  summer song's going to be?  I'm thinking lollipop. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Obie.  Wow.  Why don't we get a list  of past summer songs?  Yeah.  I'm sure it's  somewhere on the  internet.  All right, Obie.  Let's do that.  All right.  More about  Craigslist.  Jimmy, great point  though, really.  Really.  It's amazing how they...  People will always be  looking for prostitutes.  And so, right now,  it's at a good place.  To me, that's where  the government should  stay the fuck out  of your life.  Where it's a bunch  of adults. 
[02:40:00]  Fucking, you want  to get fucked,  you get fucked.  It's like that to me  is where government  intrusion matters  because there's no  victims.  It's people all  volunteering for this  exchange.  It's exploitation  of women who...  They can't really  take care of themselves.  They can't think  for themselves.  Well, legally,  they can,  unfortunately.  They're allowed  to legally.  And a lot of them  make tremendous  amounts of money.  And it's hard to tell  a girl like Ashley  Dupree who made  $4,000 for a night's  work that she's not  thinking for herself.  She does three of 
[02:40:30]  those a week.  That's 12 grand a week.  That's fucking...  What's 12 times 4?  48,000.  I mean, that's a lot  of money, man.  It's, you know...  Yeah.  You tell a girl  making a half million  dollars a year,  she can't think  for herself for more  than that.  All right, here we go.  The second half  of the story.  Despite a disclaimer  and warning post  seen before entering  the section that  users need to be  at least 18 years old,  prostitution is  prohibited, as well  as human trafficking  and exploitation,  Goya and other  advocates maintain  that the services  being offered are  not just for  companionship.  Their pimps  advertise them as 
[02:41:00]  companions for  a generous donation.  Sometimes they'll  substitute the word  roses for cash.  Law enforcement  has to recognize  that prostitution  has moved off  the street corner  onto the internet  and we now need  to use 21st century  technology to combat it.  And then you deal  with the internet  and then it's going  to move on to  somewhere else.  Just stop.  Gives a shit.  The guy shows up  with a thousand  roses.  Yeah, you missed  the points.  Here you go.  You didn't get  the code.  No, dummy.  And they try to  fuck you and you're 
[02:41:30]  like, I only want  companionship.  I'm lonely.  I want a friend.  Here's your flowers.  Why are you sending  me away?  I brought you roses.  Your aunt said.  Yes.  Your aunt said  200 roses.  I'm generous.  Companionship.  I wish Brendan  a fire.  No one would  talk to me.  Poor Ted.  Springing roses.  That's right.  Well, you know,  I get them very cheap  because it's Ted's  flower shop. 
[02:42:00]  Did you hear the  Ted promo yet?  No.  Oh, do you have  the Ted promo?  And also the two  new promos we played  yesterday.  Jimmy's got to hear  them for the first  time.  If you could get  them on disc for me,  the ones we played  yesterday, that would  be very, very nice.  You haven't heard  the Ted thing yet?  I didn't realize how  many times you used  Ted as the character.  I swear to God, as  the name of your  characters.  I finally caught on  late in the game.  This goes way back,  Jimmy.  I don't have to tell  you, but they put 
[02:42:30]  together the whole  Ted thing.  Who is that?  It's Professor Ted  from Ted, Ted, Ted  Burns, Teddy Rash, Ted  Portnork, Ted's Match  Emporium, Ted's Inflatable  Rat Factory, Ted's  Egg Emporium.  You're listening to the  Ted Show.  Ted's an ass.  You used it a lot.  They forgot Ted, the  light bulb salesman.  The light bulb.  Yeah, I know.  That was the big one  right there.  It's all right.  Actually, not the  light bulb salesman. 
[02:43:00]  He just made filaments.  Of course he did.  Ted's a filament  salesman.  And each one cost a  lot of money.  I don't remember that,  yeah.  I think it was $7 for  filament.  So now the media's  going after Craigslist.  You might as well.  Go have fun.  What's this guy's  last name?  Goya?  What a douchebag.  Fucking faggot  assemblyman.  Jimmy was out in L.A.,  but this came in  yesterday.  The Cream Pie Jones  thing.  Cream Pie Jones  getting a little  action.  Allegedly.  The boys put this  together.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
[02:43:30]  Green Pie Jones.  Green Pie Jones?  What do you want me  to do?  They wanted me to make  cumzies.  Cumzies.  Green Pie.  She's squeezing  his honey.  Green Pie.  Touching his penis.  Green Pie.  It's a full  erection.  Green Pie.  Oh my God.  Green Pie.  She's stuck in my  titty.  Green Pie.  I'm such a worm.  Green Pie.  She's jerking off  on her tits.  Green Pie.  Oh my God.  Oh, shit.  I think he made  the cumzies.  He made  the cumzies.  The cumzies. 
[02:44:00]  He made  the cumzies.  He made  the cumzies.  Green Pie.  Green Pie.  Like the  cream pie chant  in that.  Yeah.  My favorite part.  And then finally,  Anthony is the star  of the latest  promo.  Mmm.  Remember when we  were talking about  cum eating, Jimmy?  Yes.  Remember.  O&A Independent  Features presents  Anthony, Portrait 
[02:44:30]  of a Cold Cum Eater.  Dear Diary,  last night I ate  cold cum.  I never thought  I liked cum.  The story of one  man's secret desire  to consume the  semen of other  men.  Warm cum can be  lapped up.  Cold cum must be  chewed and bitten  off of the hand.  Nung, nung, nung.  Cold semen, that is.  I so enjoy  cold cum.  Eaten from the  manly calloused  hand of a 
[02:45:00]  janitor at my  school.  Anthony, Portrait  of a Cold Cum Eater.  Coming to theaters  this fall.  Why does everything  have to come to  theaters?  I know.  There's stupid  comic timing.  He would have said  cold cumming to  theaters.  Right.  Why would he, though?  Why do you have to  end it with coming to  theaters this fall?  Really?  Do you know what,  by the way, not to  relabor an old subject,  but one of the worst  parts about eating  cold cum out of a  man's hand would be  if he was affectionate  and as you buried  your lips in his  fucking hand, if his  loose fingers were 
[02:45:30]  caressing your cheek  while you'd come  gobbled.  Why, Jimmy?  Why?  And what kind of  sound would you make  as you were gobbling  it up?  Let's go to  Cleveland.  Jeremy!  Hey, boys.  I got a question for  Jimmy since he's the  hooker expert.  I saw her posting  for a $120 hour  GFE experience  and she speaks  Greek.  Do you think  that's a good deal?  Yes, because she's  multilingual. 
[02:46:00]  It's always fun.  You could talk about  the island of Lesbos  and the controversy  that's happening  there.  Rather to be a  lesbo.  You could just  fuck or shit her.  Whatever you want  to do, sir.  We'd love to,  but who knows  what's happening.  We'd love to,  but you know,  Rover's taking over  that town.  There's nothing  we can do about it.  Oh, fuck Rover.  He ain't nothing.  FMQB was all over  Rover's ass because  he got 20,000  people together  or something.  Whatever. 
[02:46:30]  Push out, guys.  Whatever.  Let's say hi to  Steven in Rockland.  Steven!  Hey, buddy.  I want to ask if you  remember a little  piece of radio gold  you aired when you  first started on  N.E.W.  It was a  Chumba Wumba  spoof with  Bill Clinton.  My pants go down.  No, huh?  Oh, my God.  We don't have that,  do we?  You have that,  E-Rock?  Oh, shit.  Stupid E-Rock. 
[02:47:00]  Outgoing message.  Turn left.  All right,  will you turn  left already?  Thank you, Steven.  We'll try to find  the Clinton Chumba Wumba  bit,  which I think  might be...  You think you know  what he's talking  about?  I know what  he's talking about.  Did you do it?  I don't remember  if...  I think it...  Wasn't it Rick?  I'm not sure.  It's when my  pants fall down.  What was this  bit about? 
[02:47:30]  It's a song  parody.  We liked  song parodies  back then.  Yeah.  Who didn't?  Everyone loved  a good song  parody,  didn't they?  Jesus.  Radio is...  Combines the  familiar with the  new.  All right.  As E-Rock  looks for it,  there's no way  he'll find it  today.  You know that  construction worker  story?  Yes.  Well, they got  another one.  Breaking news  about Facebook,  everyone.  And what kind  of Facebook  friend are you?  A new study 
[02:48:00]  finds people  who are more  isolated in real  life spend  more time on  Facebook.  Facebook users  who reported  feeling anxiety  and fear  in their  face-to-face  relationships  spent more  time communicating  online.  But the study  also found  that those  who are more  introverted  actually have  fewer Facebook  friends.  Things that  make you go,  hmm.  Yeah.  That's not  one of them.  No.  No, not at all.  That's a complete 
[02:48:30]  waste of time.  Of course.  Things that  make you,  ugh.  So if you  have a lot of  friends on Facebook,  that means you  don't have a lot  of friends in  real life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  You don't like  going out and  meeting real  people.  Right.  You tend to  make more  friends online.  Mm.  Things that  make you go,  of course.  That's obvious,  dummy.  All right,  we're going to  take our first  break here at  XM Satellite Radio.  What do we got  coming up? 
[02:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  After the break,  and I want to  hear, like,  some excitement  out there when  I say this,  guys.  Please,  help us out.  After the break  on this fine  show called  Opian Anthony,  Wiener  Barbecue.  Yeah!  All right.  The Opian  Anthony Program.  Or that  stupid XM  stinger they  do.  What is it?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  XM 202. 
[02:49:30]  Are you guys ready  for Wiener Barbecue?  Why are they muffled today?  All right,  look up at the screen.  Their screen's on out there?  Yeah,  put it on right there.  Jimmy,  have you seen  Wiener Barbecue yet?  I haven't,  Opie.  What is it?  It sounds delish. 
[02:50:00]  Here's Wiener Barbecue,  Jimmy.  You gotta look up there.  Okay.  You gotta see.  I've heard this is  a little  hard to watch.  I can't.  You can't watch it?  Danny can't watch it?  You know,  there's this  There's certain things  I can't watch.  There's this phenomenon  that goes on  after the show  that I didn't know about  until yesterday.  Our own  Steve C  likes to go into the office  after the show  and wind down 
[02:50:30]  by watching  zit-popping videos.  And blister-popping.  And blister-popping videos.  Why?  They are these  disgusting videos  of huge  pussy  like zits  and  big pussy  cysts  that are being squeezed  and watching them  and watching them  just explode  in a warm  mess of  pus.  Why would you  want to watch that?  I don't know.  I couldn't watch it.  But Steve  just  basks in it  after the program.  He likes watching that 
[02:51:00]  to wind down,  he said.  And he watches them.  I couldn't even watch it.  Now,  you've seen those,  right, Danny?  Some of the blister-popping stuff?  Yeah.  And the zit-popping?  I mean,  I could watch it,  but it's uninteresting.  Harder to watch than...  Nah,  that's easy stuff.  Really?  Is that your food, Jimmy?  I'm done with it.  Oh, okay.  Steve,  what is the deal?  What is this?  Oh, let's just watch it.  I'm scared.  Oh, no.  I love a wiener.  I have no idea what he's talking about.  Are you doing something else?  Yes.  We're talking about you.  Yes, I understand.  Thank you very much.  It's called popthatzit.com. 
[02:51:30]  It's a website  that's full of blisters  and pussy abscesses  and sebaceous cysts  and people just lancing them.  It's so disgusting.  I have no idea,  but it's always just something.  It was  the fascination  that somebody would actually  compile an entire website  with these things.  Well, give us one.  We'll get to Wiener Barbecue, guys.  Don't worry.  Wiener Barbecue.  There you go.  Steve,  when was the last time  you heard from Washington?  Fuck. 
[02:52:00]  Actually, no.  That's not...  Maybe last week, I think.  I got a phone call from Don,  but he's on vacation.  Yeah, but Don's not in the loop either.  Yeah, but anybody...  Anyone else besides Don.  No offense to Don, but...  Honestly, I...  It's been a while, right?  It's been a while.  Don will probably survive it, though.  The whole merger thing.  Yeah.  Wicklund's good.  Yeah, I like him.  Well, what?  What?  Find one.  Oh, God.  I can't even watch this.  What is it? 
[02:52:30]  Oh.  Jared!  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I know why Steve likes those blister-popping videos.  It looks enough like a nice pump shot  without being a faggot.  It was described way funnier than that.  Steve?  Comment?  False.  Anyway.  There you go.  So you guys want to watch this one?  Is this a random one?  I don't think I've seen this one.  All right.  Jimmy, here you go.  Zip-popping videos.  It's the new phenomenon.  In the back office.  I can't watch. 
[02:53:00]  The most disgusting back pimple ever.  I doubt it.  Look how big it is.  Where is it on the back?  Squeezing.  On his back.  Squeeze it.  There it goes.  Oh.  Wow.  A caterpillar's coming out.  Would you eat that?  Jesus, I can't watch.  Ooh, it squirted out on his finger.  Just a zit.  Oh my God.  It's like a white caterpillar.  Dan, that bothers you?  It's being removed from his back.  That's just nasty.  Imagine sucking that off and just fucking...  Why do you guys watch... 
[02:53:30]  I don't get why you would watch this.  Because they're on everybody.  Everybody's got these.  I haven't had to do that since I was 15 years old.  I have sticks up in my cock head.  Is that bad?  All right.  Why is this video five minutes long?  Because it's a big zit.  You've got to work it out.  Yeah.  That's a lot of pussing spirit.  Women love popping zits.  They love it.  Every girl I've ever dated...  I don't have that many,  but they love just digging their fucking rotten...  It's a way to hurt you. 
[02:54:00]  I don't think that's it.  God, I looked.  Fuck.  I think it's like correcting imperfections  because I've noticed that most of these videos  are women popping zits on men's facts.  Of course it is.  That's all it is.  They love doing it because it hurts.  Look at this one now.  Sadistic horse.  That's a big zit.  Where's this one?  I think it's still on the...  I think it's the same one.  Same one.  It just said take two.  Oh.  Still working it out?  Yeah.  All right enough.  That shit hurts.  Let's get Wiener Barbecue on.  Oh, I thought that was Wiener Barbecue.  Wiener Barbecue.  All right.  Now, the other day you guys threw a beheading video on 
[02:54:30]  and I just had to turn around.  That's my line.  I want to see if this is my line, too.  I want to see if I can sit through this.  It's called Wiener Barbecue.  Oh!  Get the fuck out of here.  There's a guy.  His penis is on the grill.  Is he sticking the fork through the tip of his pee hole?  He's pretty much rotating his penis on the grill. 
[02:55:00]  And there's even grill marks on the back of his penis.  Ow!  Now he's sticking...  The fork.  He's got a two-pronged barbecue fork.  He's sticking one prong right up his piss hole.  He's just rolling the penis around the hot barbecue.  Oh, this looks like it hurts.  Is this fake?  It's got to be.  I don't care what it is, but I can't watch.  It's terrible to watch.  It could just be smoke coming through.  And he could be one of those guys that can just take something in his piss hole.  Like, a lot of guys could take shit in their piss. 
[02:55:30]  Let's see if there's any...  Was that it?  It's probably fake.  I would say...  What's the explanation for this?  Bad childhood.  Explanation.  Somebody wanted a snack?  No, I don't know.  I really have no idea.  You don't have to say that's fake.  It could be.  It might not be.  I mean, I can't watch that other one.  The BME Pain Olympics video that you guys have seen before.  I can't watch that.  Any kind of penis torture stuff, I can't do.  Because you don't see this guy's ball bag.  You see kind of like some...  You know, like penis...  What is it called? 
[02:56:00]  Penis fat there?  Yeah, a little bit of pubis.  Pubis, right.  Thank you.  Pubis is such an awful word, isn't it?  You don't see pubic hair?  Pubis.  You had a fatty pubis.  Oh, fatty pubis.  What a great name that is.  Fatty pubis is on the phone, and he needs his money.  Fatty pubis.  Hello, fatty pubis.  This is fatty pubis, and I'd like my money, please.  Ken Pubis.  Greetings.  Of course not.  Fatty pubis.  Oh, what's the link? 
[02:56:30]  That's right.  If people would like to check this out, it's wienerbbq.com.  Okay.  I before either.  Wienerbbq.com.  All right.  There you go.  Check it out for yourself.  I think it's fake.  This is Ted Pildes.  Do you know my brother, fatty?  Hey, greetings from Pat Duffy's radio camp starring Cream Pie Jones.  Greetings from Pat Duffy's radio camp.  Here's another happy camper's postcard home. 
[02:57:00]  Dear Mom and Dad, camp is totally awesome.  I'm having a great time here with Opie, Anthony, Jim, and the rest of the gang.  They even have a special nickname for me.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Cream Pie Jones.  We're learning a lot of things about life and love.  I've even met a girl named Bree.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't know your cock was going to be this big.  The entire staff is very encouraging.  One night, I even snuck into her bunk.  Mom and Dad, proud to say that that night, I became a man. 
[02:57:30]  Sounds like it's going to be a great summer.  Pat, I've got Jim's coffee.  What size is that?  Large.  How many times do I have to tell you goddamn kids he wants media?  Jim is a fancy man that only deserves the best.  Now get it right or fucking die.  Why don't you do that to me?  Oh, that hurts so much. 
[02:58:00]  Good acting.  Yeah, it was very believable acting, but I liked the message.  Cream Pie.  Wow, you could act, man.  I guess that was the Friday that I was leaving.  I left early.  Yeah.  And Cream Pie actually was able to...  I watched it.  I was right there.  Can I tell you how sexy she was?  How many times have you jerked off to that?  Two or three times.  She's fucking...  Brie Olsen rules.  Yeah?  She's fucking the bee's knees, if I might.  That was Brie Olsen? 
[02:58:30]  I think so, right?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought it was going to be What's-Her-Name again.  Dude.  Brie Olsen's hiney.  It's so sniffable.  And she took care of you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What a trooper.  It was awesome.  Her, not you.  She's the trooper.  Yeah.  I know.  Wow, Cream Pie.  How long did it take?  Five, seven minutes.  Yeah.  And fucking...  If he's shy, he kept trying to turn around so I wouldn't see his penis.  Jimmy was right there.  Jimmy was...  I was doing a play-by-play.  Yeah.  He was afraid I'd see his penis and tell everybody that's small or whatever. 
[02:59:00]  I gotta say it.  Fine.  Why would I say that on the air?  That's crazy.  I would never say that.  That breaks the guy code.  Who gives a shit?  You're hung like an acorn.  Yeah.  Doesn't matter.  Still got the job done.  Sure did.  Hey, uh...  Tall child.  Did you guys see the Vern Troy sex tape?  No.  No.  You haven't seen that yet?  You saw it, right?  I saw a piece of it.  It's on TMZ.com.  It's just his disgusting little tongue sticking out into her mouth. 
[02:59:30]  That's a new one, though.  I remember seeing a video at least a year, maybe even longer than that ago, of Vern Troyer  and some smoking hot blonde.  And it was totally him because nobody looks like that.  No.  Nobody looks like that.  You can't fake being him.  And it was just him and some blonde girl just fucking...  I have no idea where...  I can't find it now.  How funny does him fucking look?  It's hysterical.  It's gotta be hysterical.  Is that video still around?  It's gotta be.  I went looking for it this morning, but the only results I could find was obviously this  new one because now it just hit yesterday, so...  Yeah, they got like 10, 15 seconds on TMZ kissing a girl and she's like totally not 
[03:00:00]  into it whatsoever.  Oh, wait, can you see it?  Yeah, go to TMZ.  I had enough of him.  A little shitty twerp.  Hey, as Danny finds that, a lot of you guys have the iPhones?  Yes.  I'm a big fan of the BlackBerry myself.  I like my BlackBerry.  I like my iPhone.  Well, women, one particular woman thinks the iPhone is sexist, Jimmy.  Sexist.  Does she?  Yeah.  What fucking annoying, no dick-getting fucking monster is this? 
[03:00:30]  Monster.  Well, some women are saying that Apple is treating them like second-class citizens when  it comes to the iPhone.  Apparently, women who have long nails have trouble typing on it, which is why they're  giving these sexist claims.  It's because the virtual keyboard responds to the electrical charge.  You have to worry about fucking people with nails.  Shut the fuck up.  How about men with long nails?  Or how about you cut your fucking nails, twat? 
[03:01:00]  Why would I say that?  He gets so upset with himself so quickly.  It was just needless.  Pointless.  Oh, there he is.  Look at that fucking alien.  Little Vern.  Watch her trying to make believe she's into this.  Watch.  Watch.  She's awful.  Here's Vern Troy just sticking his tongue in and out of her mouth.  Watch her face.  It's like kissing a baby. 
[03:01:30]  His breath probably smells like little people.  Probably smells nervous.  Look, she's kind of pushing away.  Awful mingot mouth.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  They need more of that.  They need a little more of that clip.  Yeah.  Him being fucked by King Kong Bundy.  Right in his Vern mouth.  So you don't like women with their nails, Jimmy?  I don't mind nails, but fucking get rid of them.  I'm sick.  I like a good ruby red whore nail wrapped around my dick.  I really do.  Yeah.  But don't complain because you can't type on the iPhone. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  I'm not a big fan of the Long Island fake nails.  Oh, no.  They're awful.  Better mind a little nail.  If it's like the real nail, though, the fucking fake nails.  Yeah.  What about this?  You cut your nails.  Fucking asshole.  It's like you need balls to work it.  Cut your nails, you fucking secretary.  They're giving these sexist claims.  It's because the virtual keyboard responds to the electrical charge emitted by fingertips  and not fingernails.  Many women want the phone to now come with a stylus, one of those little plastic pens. 
[03:02:30]  No, bitch.  The iPhone fingernail problem doesn't appear to have hurt sales, though, with women  because Apple has sold six million iPhones since 2007,  and one out of every three iPhones was bought by a woman.  Really?  I'm just going to stand for this.  And we have one here.  You're testing it out.  And it's true.  If you try to use your nails, it won't work.  Good.  You shouldn't.  Glass, asshole.  Why don't you use a diamond?  Fucking idiots.  How about this?  You go to the Spencer's and buy a rubber finger and put it over your fucking dumb broad nail. 
[03:03:00]  Broad nail.  What are you doing with those fucking picking up cocktail franks with your nails?  Jimmy, what are you doing?  I'm annoyed down there with the nails.  What are you doing?  Fucking nuts.  They're just women with nails.  Relax.  But I'm complaining.  I wouldn't mind if they had nails.  Just jerk a guy off with them.  But stop complaining.  I'd like to tap my screen, but I can't.  Could you make a stylus?  No.  No, we can't.  The whole thing is you don't need a stylus with the iPhone.  Mm-hmm.  You can't finger a guy's asshole either. 
[03:03:30]  How about that?  The pat of your finger on there.  Sexist little iPhone.  It's not that hard.  You can get it done, but yeah.  Redesign.  Order it up.  There you go.  Stylus on the way.  Hold on.  I'm trying this.  What?  What, Jimmy?  What are you doing?  I'm tap-tapping away, and it's moving fine.  With your dick?  No.  Oh, I just took it down there.  Oh, no.  Using your fingernail?  Yeah, it's not the same.  I love using my man's finger.  It doesn't work with my fingernail. 
[03:04:00]  Can't use it, huh, slits?  Why, Jimmy?  Why?  Because they had me put back in their place.  Get in there and make me a fucking PB&J.  Fucking two-titted hole.  Now go bake me a pie.  Go bake a fried pie, bro.  That's what they do.  Go in there and make something pretty.  Go fucking spritz that Febreze around in a little while.  You fucking nails.  The guys are trying to push the tomato audio that Josh and Jared collected from the streets 
[03:04:30]  of New York.  Danny, why do we have to play this?  Well, you don't have to, but I mean, I think the audio will probably speak for itself.  Really?  I'm thinking.  First of all, Ruth Bader Ginsburg will take fucking E.T.  Yeah.  And let's give it a shot.  See if it's any good.  That's a good breaking news real quick.  Supreme Court overrules gun ban.  You know, in Washington, D.C., you're forbidden from owning a handgun.  And they just struck it down as unconstitutional. 
[03:05:00]  Now people in Washington, D.C. can legally buy and own a handgun.  Well, after all the rigmarole.  What is Cream Pie Jones doing in here?  Cream Pie helped.  Cream Pie.  I helped a little question.  What's your real name?  Jared.  Oh, so you're Jared of Josh and Jared.  Yes.  Oh, now we have to do this.  So you guys went out and collected tomato audio?  Yeah, Josh came up with a series of questions.  I kind of just went out there and kind of coached him a little bit. 
[03:05:30]  But hey, most of it's all him.  How'd you coach him?  Well, you know, kind of like the style of questioning, you know, come up with follow-ups.  But Sam, how did Cream Pie Jones coach Josh?  Well, we sent Cream Pie out because he's been gaining intern MVP of the day the past, like, three, four times in a row.  So we sent him out with Josh.  Because Josh became obsessed when the news started reporting about tomatoes. 
[03:06:00]  Tomatoes.  Tomatoes.  Salmonella.  Yes.  Poison.  And tomatoes.  Yes.  So we said, you know, we want to train you guys to be out on the street.  And, you know, Jared's done it a lot.  So we're going to send Jared out with you.  But we've never played any of Jared's audio.  Right, but he's done it.  So, like, he knows how to use the recorder.  So we knew that at least it'd be audible.  You figured that thing out with the red button?  Yeah.  All by myself.  Wow.  Good boy. 
[03:06:30]  And, I mean, we figured with Josh's questions and with Jared's technical expertise.  This is a magical team.  Exactly.  We got actually, I have copies of the raw questions he made.  Josh had a full page of questions about tomatoes.  How many questions did Josh come up with about tomatoes?  Unfortunately, they're not numbered, but I would guesstimate 25 to 30 questions about tomatoes.  Wow.  So about tomatoes.  Tomato questions?  Yes.  Jimmy, could you take a look at some of those questions?  Sure.  Any of them catch your eye? 
[03:07:00]  Can I have a copy, too, please?  There's some laugh-getters in here.  Yeah, like what, Jimmy?  The first one's a good one.  Are you worried about your kids'-  Ah, I like number two.  Can we, um...  Can we at least hear-  Do you actually ask these?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  I will tell you this.  Question number one was far and above his favorite, right?  That's the one you were kind of most proud of.  I think I gave you a copy of that.  Yeah, I like one. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  I'm a fan of that one.  You're a fan of-  And you wrote this, right, Josh?  Yes, sir.  All right, here we go.  Give it a day in court.  Bob Waldman from New York, New York.  Are you worried about your kids playing with Mr. Tomato Head, who killed Mr. Potato Head?  No, I think that Potato Head and people like that can take care of themselves, and I'm not  really afraid about Mr. Tomato Head.  What's the future of the BLT?  I think we have a problem going here, but it will change into something else. 
[03:08:00]  I guess, just a B, a BL.  If someone threw a tomato in front of a loved one, would you jump in front of it?  No, they're on their own.  No, they're on their own.  No.  Jimmy?  What up?  now one of the main problems is uh this was about josh sees a problem young sam no the only problem 
[03:08:30]  who are you to say that no not in the audio right don't get me wrong uh he would have a tear in your  eyes it's allergies allergic to tomatoes are you don't get me started about a week and a half ago  he went out to get this audio yeah since then and danny can attest to this because he probably 
[03:09:00]  loves them the best the tomato jokes have not stopped no and i remember the day that this was  being written all these questions uh i was trying to slap together me and uh travis trying to slap  together some big a news and uh i just couldn't deal with the incessant tomato talk in the back  office that i actually had to get up and i had to do my work elsewhere because i just couldn't  fucking take it anymore so what do you what is it with you and the tomatoes josh story i don't know  just with all the stuff going on in the world and everyone seems to be obsessed with tomatoes it 
[03:09:30]  kind of fascinates me i guess so all right so of these questions what was what was the goal with  these uh where's the joke like yeah were these basically serious or were you just trying to be  being funny trying to well not being serious i guess trying to ask funny questions be funny all  right all right let's try the next one josh and uh cream pie jones asking a lot of questions about  tomatoes is green ketchup better because it isn't red like tomatoes all right now listen i'm going to 
[03:10:00]  give you a little bit of advice you fellows should be eating a lot of processed tomatoes and when you hit  80 and 90 you'll have no problems with you has anyone ever told you you look like daddy warbox  daddy warbox the answer to that question is not no one's ever told you you look like daddy warbox  what do you do thank you sir jimmy yeah anthony yeah yeah it's um are they still in the studio  it's uh how do you feel about the kool-aid guy changing his look so he doesn't look like a tomato 
[03:10:30]  oh no really what are you talking about jimmy i'm not about the tomatoes  well what about will you ever wear red clothing again why wouldn't you well the whole thing was  that red comes from tomatoes that was the whole that was asking people  when mike myers came in uh mike myers had twizzlers you know brought in for him because 
[03:11:00]  that's what he likes and uh josh went on a tirade about how we shouldn't have twizzlers  because twizzlers come from tomatoes because they're red well i'd like question number two  you have red all over your shirt what are you doing you're wearing tomatoes that's true  about the tomatoes why are you wearing tomatoes the detroit jersey where's all this tomato philosophy  you're not practicing at home i don't know i mean i guess because um tomatoes are back now in the 
[03:11:30]  stores and stuff i figured it was okay you just bought that jersey then no did you throw it out  last week i didn't wear it last week though why'd you keep it still in your house contaminating with  their tomatoishness that's true that's true you know you guys aren't being fair question two i like  actually if there's a tornado if there's a tomato tornado and one lands in your mouth and then you  shut your mouth and accidentally swallow it will you eat it what's a tomato what the fuck is a  tornado tornado what is that josh what is that i don't know um i was trying to well i was trying 
[03:12:00]  to think of a tongue twister and then i gave i gave people a free miniature bottle of ketchup if they  could say that 10 times fast oh because ketchup's got to go well you forget uh tornadoes were recently  in the news because of the weather yeah so what i think josh said he was doing was kind of trying to  get the two big news stories which was tomato oh cool and put them together sam just can't stop 
[03:12:30]  laughing at them no i like question three though really news stories make sense did god punish us  with a tornado because we damaged his tomatoes tomato tornado what do you mean josh i'm not sure  what do you mean by that one that i don't know if there was i guess if there was a tornado on a  maybe a tomato farm all the tomatoes went in the air no no i got it but i'm saying  how did we damage his tomatoes by infecting them with salmonella yeah jimmy so you think the tornado 
[03:13:00]  is retribution i was asking people what did you think i didn't think i didn't see a connection  you think other people might possibly you're talking about the gas prices and the tomato  prices to me the other day what were you saying oh that um the price of uh i think a barrel of  tomatoes has dropped drastically people are afraid to eat them and the price of gas has gone up so 
[03:13:30]  what's your connection i'm sure it's funny i i didn't see one i was just gonna ask people no you  said you think that maybe there are less people driving to get tomatoes because of the gas prices  oh right because farmers have increased gas costs that's what wow speaking of tomatoes we should  paint this bit red and drop it out of the enola gate i don't want to be too harsh is steve ever awake  during the interview where is steve i don't know no actually steve actually wasn't around for this 
[03:14:00]  interview so i interviewed him will you be buying the limited edition tomato free ketchup that was  released today was released today was it released no made that made that up so you just kind of like  like just thinking of funny interesting things trying to tomatoes  um should we stop eating apples because they look like tomatoes no that's not written down there 
[03:14:30]  right no you just made that one up no it's trying to come up with a stupider one yeah is that it  because oh no it's there will the new iphone not be red since red comes from tomato that one wasn't  mine that one wasn't oh oh all right well that one was kind of funny yeah we liked that one sorry  who's who's was it who's it unfortunately carlin passed away so we know it wasn't his  but there was some confusion there it could have possibly been right sure whose was this one i don't

[03:20:00]  until they get rid  of the crisis  on the tomatoes  there's no future  do you think  they could substitute  anything for it  no  maybe another tea  no  turnip  tedious  no  turkey  no  tilapia  no  terrible  anything  Josh  how do you feel  you did  I mean  not too good  but  gotta start somewhere  probably could have  done better  probably  not too good  not too good 
[03:20:30]  the kid loves tomatoes  well he certainly does  will you continue  to use tomatoes  as sex toys  my voice  you boys  are out of your minds  is this a joke  no  you don't use  a tomato  as a sex toy  I'm telling you  there is no such thing  no such thing  as a tomato  sex toy  how would you know  now let me tell you boys  you've gone  over the line  oh  you're shock jocks 
[03:21:00]  we don't talk about this  it's crazy  why  oh she's an older woman  and everything  hold on  let's go back  this bitch should have been  a stewed tomato  between a woman's legs  can I tell you  that fucking  Jared's improv skills  are awful too  oh  why  I thought it was  pretty terrific  no  no  with me  well I'm an older woman  we don't talk about  this thing  why  I just told you  60's the new 50  60's the new 50  now right there

[03:22:00]  look at that  but not quite as sturdy  and solid  you know what  use lad bag  has a great idea  for Josh  make this kid  eat tomatoes  until he pukes  we'll just talk about them  more until the rest of us  do  kid Josh  it's a good bit  it's actually not bad  no  I think you should do a follow up  yes 
[03:22:30]  I think just the questions  need to be reworked  a little bit  right  yeah  I think so  you think he can come up  with some more tomato questions  try to  alright Sam  make sure he comes up  with more tomato questions  100 more  by tomorrow  alright  get 20  20 more  for real  Jimmy was joshing  I was just joshing  I was just pony tomato  see Josh  joshing  why are you doing that  Jimmy 
[03:23:00]  I don't know  I just wanted to make  some kind of a noise  I feel aggressive  and there he goes  oh man  catch it  forgot your little  liquid tomatoes  boo  wow  and a smattering  of applause  from the  from the live audience  is the kid gonna cry  I don't think so  hope not  Josh  you gonna cry  he didn't look  very happy  get a minute  where's this kid  oh god  oh he goes 
[03:23:30]  yeah  yeah  yeah  no I know  I mean it was  it was his first time out  I think he did pretty good  Josh you alright  yeah  you're learning  I know  you seem sad  why are you sad  I mean I was hoping that  it would be received better  but  I understand  what were you hoping for  like what part  like was there something we missed  we didn't play much of it  in fairness  yeah  no probably not actually  oh look  little tomatoes 
[03:24:00]  I gave away like 10 of those  those were popular  little ketchups  people like those  yes ketchups  are a very popular condiment  but popular condiment  that's in demand  it's really hard to get  you know there's a myth  that popular condiment  equals comedic gold  really  not always  a myth  believe me you should have learned  that the Dijon disaster  we went through  no but Josh is  there's something going on  what's wrong Josh  what's wrong  nah I'm good  I'm fine  you don't sound fine  you don't sound fine  I hope he's right 
[03:24:30]  I don't know  tell us what's going on  do you want to sit down  yeah sit down  I'm alright  I'm fine  you don't seem alright  nah you really seem  kind of bummed  and you were kind of  in a good mood  when you first came in  and now you seem  a little down  we're always honest  on the show  we try to be  what's wrong  I don't know  I mean  I don't know  I don't know  I don't think you do  you were like 
[03:25:00]  I think you're just  trying to  you know  you want to be cool  you're trying not to  stir up waves  whatever  but you did the bit  you had some  you heard all these  you listened to the tape  right  yeah  and you enjoyed it  yeah  okay  and what were you  expecting when you  came in with it  I don't know  I thought it would be  received alright  like we would  they would get laughs  some  okay  and we'd be doing  lunch together  and you know  thinking of other bits  and stuff  you look like  you're gonna cry  you alright  I'm alright  yeah  I'm fine  do you feel embarrassed 
[03:25:30]  kind of  it's alright though  sure  happens  we all make  asses out of our songs  why are you embarrassed  I'm confused  I don't know  I guess that was my  lame attempt  to trying to be funny  like basically  is this a validation  of your greatest fear  like you're always afraid  that you're gonna  put it out there  and be like  humiliated  and then people  are gonna go  you're not good enough  and all of a sudden  you put it out there  and you know  people are like  I guess  yeah  yeah  got a song for you  for you Josh 
[03:26:00]  oh  it's cool though  you guys got laughs  out of it  even though it was at me  that's okay  it's alright though  yeah  hear the headphones on  Josh  you can hear the song  playing for you  come on  turn the light  up on them  for your ears  oh  these emo faggots  they're not emo  they're out  since 70 something  Josh what's wrong 
[03:26:30]  really  nothing  I'm really alright  I see a tear  in your eye though  yeah  there's no crying  in radio  you really hurt huh  yeah he's  I mean kinda  I'll be honest  alright let's talk it out  what are you hurt about  no I just thought  it would be received better  it's alright that it wasn't though  like I said  I'm glad you got laughs  even though it was at me  that's fine  oh Jesus  but it's not fine  no one wants to be laughed at  no  yeah we wanna  yeah  nobody wants people  laughing at them  especially  when you've worked 
[03:27:00]  on something  really hard  and then  it gets  you know  mocked  laughed at  and you walked around  believing for a couple weeks  that it was radio gold  and then  I don't know  you come in and realize  it's a steaming pile of shit  yeah  yeah  you wanted to contribute  a little something  get your name out there  it's fair enough  and um  it just  it just didn't go as planned  and you kinda feel  thrown under the bus  by the other guys  cause you're like  those guys set me up  to look stupid  basically 
[03:27:30]  and like  everybody's been laughing  at me behind my back  that type of stuff  that's fine though  I mean  no I mean  I'm asking  I mean  I haven't heard this yet  yeah he's  he's realizing  that they've been laughing  behind his back  for the last two weeks  is that what you're  getting at Josh  kinda I'll be honest  yeah  yeah  what did you ask him  what did I miss it  that he's finally realizing  that maybe people  have been laughing  behind his back  for the last two weeks  yeah  so what does this  validate for you  for real  I mean we all  have things missed  you worked hard on this  yeah  I thought I did 
[03:28:00]  why so many  tomato questions  I mean  they were  asking the interns  to do like  man on the street  stuff  and I was just  trying to come up  with a topic  that no one  thought of  might be a reason  that no one  thought of it  but  yeah I mean  tomatoes  are not  they're not  typically  fodder  for great comedy  yeah I know  I was  they're usually  used to  show a comedian  that he sucks  yeah  which makes it  very strange 
[03:28:30]  that you would  attempt to make  tomatoes funny  hence the  juxtaposition  of the  tomato  I was just  trying to think  outside the box  I guess  sure  outside the box  of funny  yes  there's a difference  between being  yeah outside the box  is good  but basically  outside the studio  is better  you  you started with  the mr. tomato head  one because you  wanted to come in  here with a bang  pretty much  like boom  you wanted to get  right out of the gate  and let people know  laughs are going to be coming 
[03:29:00]  and you ain't fucking around  when it comes to tomatoes  like you thought people  would laugh  because like mr. tomato head  kind of rhymes with potato head  and he killed him  we kind of go off  on a rant about that  and they're just  the crazy situations  you know  we told you  I'm sorry  I was going to say  the whole thing  like someone throwing  a tomato in front  of a loved one  would just step  in front of it  like that's almost  like a hand grenade  thing  right  yeah  almost  so you really  you were writing  were you told  like you were creative  growing up  and stuff like that 
[03:29:30]  no  no  did you always  think of yourself  as creative  I mean not really  hey  um  damn josh  I feel sick  I mean I didn't just  sit down and start  writing these  you thought of these  tried  well you did  it really sucks  when you come to the  realization that  you're just not funny  man  yeah  that's gotta blow  yeah that's  I'll be alright 
[03:30:00]  I'll be alright though  yeah  yeah I'll be alright  what's your next project  huh  I don't know  you feel like a little  bit embarrassed  at this one  you have nothing else  because I would think  if you had this in the  can there you know  waiting  to get it on the air  that you'd be thinking  alright  this is gonna go over well  I should have a follow up  well  they're sending me to the  gay pride parade on Sunday  so hopefully I'll ask  some more questions  now you can  terrible enough to laugh  now you can discuss 
[03:30:30]  oh  now you can discuss  plums for a couple hours  yeah  true  or pickups  well at least you'll be  talking to fruits  exactly  that's true  I can't wait  you got questions  that you're writing already  no I don't have any yet  what are you thinking  you have to be thinking  one or two  you figured there'd be  a follow up to this  so where do you mind  a mind like yours  you never turn it off  Josh  maybe I'll do a different  subject other than  tomatoes 
[03:31:00]  yeah  I don't know  I think that's  because he  was kind of  leaning towards  going with the same  tomato theme  for the gay pride parade  were you  I was gonna but  I'll come up with something  no no no no  no why  don't let us deter you  because you might be  you might have a bit  yeah what was  what was your angle  with the tomatoes  and the gay pride parade  I don't  I don't know  yeah you do  yeah sure  don't be shy  can't be afraid  you gotta just fire it out  I don't know  come on 
[03:31:30]  tell us one  what  something I was gonna ask  well you know  just a theme of it  or something  well come on  you had to have thought  of that  because this is obviously  a big moment for you  I don't know  no I really don't have any  anything  really ready for this  yes  um  okay  did you know like  were you gonna  show them pictures  of tomatoes  or  no I figured  they know what  a tomato was  I don't know 
[03:32:00]  they might not though  just in case  you better bring  one picture  true  about the tomatoes  I know what a lemon  is  holy shit  all right well  I am so fucking sick  of hearing about  fucking tomatoes  yeah me too  I think it was gonna  work on Sunday  because you did have  a couple like  toss the salad  references  true  and  you're gonna tell me  that doesn't work  with tomatoes  I don't know  I don't know  you know what I mean  comedic minds  I disagree  now you're doubting 
[03:32:30]  your sense of humor  totally  yeah you can't  doubt yourself  Josh  you need confidence  in comedy  did you hear  our first show  today  yeah  funny stuff  if we doubted  ourselves  we wouldn't be  here today  what'd you think  of that first show  it was alright  it was good  that's your problem  Josh you gotta  keep your chin up  you can't cry  over tomatoes  really  true  maybe over 
[03:33:00]  you know  what's the line  spilled soup  tomato soup  tomato soup  can't cry  over spilled  tomato soup  hey you know what  that's the way  the tomato bounces  true  that's true  that's the way  the tomato turns  doesn't really crumble  do you want to just  cry and get it out  you know over with  no I'm alright  I'm really alright  it would certainly  save the bit  you have a girlfriend  no  why  why no girlfriend  can't find some  hot young tomato 
[03:33:30]  no I guess not  it's uh  a lot of surveys  they've said  women  actually prefer  a good sense  of humor  it's true  first so  I'm kind of  screwed there then  that was funny  that was very funny  see  you're doubting  you're really  doubting yourself  when was the last  time you got some  pussy  I actually  haven't yet  yeah  how old are you  21  and you never 
[03:34:00]  fucked a girl  no  at least he's honest  you ever had your  cock and ball  service with a mouth  no  I'm trying to ask  you respectfully  no  never got a blowjob  drill a hole in a  tomato  no  um  you have a kisser  girl  yeah  just kiss her  yeah  or tongue kiss her  tongue kiss  any reason  you're um  a virgin  virgin  I know uh  I guess just  I don't know  you're homosexual  cause sometimes  people have this  moral thing  sometimes it's  religious  sometimes it's  just a personal 
[03:34:30]  choice  sometimes it's  saving it for  marriage  what is it  with you  are you saving  it  no I don't  know  maybe I don't  know  yeah  have you  sucked a girl's  breasts  no  never feel  one  no  wow you never  felt a tit  no  I feel like  tomatoes  right  sure  right  good ones do  bad ones feel  like a tomato  with like a  fucking one of  those little  shake up glass  clothes  Danny's writing

[03:39:30]  so what's  I guess I just wasn't ready  to  I don't know  talk about jerking off  I guess yeah  well let's talk about it  I mean  do you feel guilty about it  I don't know  is it jerking off  you consider that like  embarrassing  I guess  yeah  why  no everyone does it  we do it  all of us do it  gotta jack that fucking  what part  gotta jack that cock  hot cum hits you in the chest  oh yeah that's an excellent  point I'll be making  is it 
[03:40:00]  would you come into anything  or is it just on you  that's a good  good question  come in a sock  you ever just look around  and go  I ain't got nothing around here  I wanna jerk off  I don't wanna get out of bed  I'm just gonna cum in a sock  yeah  you ever do that  do you know  we've all done it  that's why everyone's laughing  I used to cum on myself  and I was  this is true  I'd wipe it off with my sheets  and then I would just  move my sheet over  and fall asleep  and it was crusted  my grandmother one time  was helping me change my sheet  and she said  what is this 
[03:40:30]  and I'm like  I spilled Pepsi  Pepsi  how does Pepsi  I don't know  you're asking me  like I thought it out  like an architect  I don't know  so where do you  where do you  where do you lay that batch down  I'm done  I'm sorry  you're done  I've never heard  you're done  I know  I'm done  I give up  you guys got me  we don't wanna get you  no we don't wanna get you  we don't wanna hurt you  we're just talking to you  we're just kinda getting to know you  a little bit  it's not a win-lose situation  yeah yeah  this isn't a competition 
[03:41:00]  or anything  it's just  this is what we do  on a daily basis  we just talk to each other  about you know  this bullshit  yeah  that's all  he's an innocent guy  like you  how old are you Josh  21  you said that  21 okay  okay  now  the tomato jokes  are a little innocent  that's why we tease  and that's a little bit of  it's kind of  it comes from a nice place  but they're  they're innocent jokes  they're not really  you're not a barbarian  obviously  and  so what are you shy 
[03:41:30]  are you very  are you kind of introverted  oh that's a good question  I guess yes  yeah  um  you're brothers and sisters  no  you're an only child  only child  okay  that's interesting  parents are still married right  you live with them  healthy parents  I mean  like  good marriage  were you taught  were you taught about sex  it was healthy  it was bad  I'm done  I'm done  I'm sorry  we'll  we'll  we'll  we'll reign it back  a little bit  yeah  and talk about  just 
[03:42:00]  going out  you got  you got friends and shit  yeah  I'd say  oh boy  what's the matter  Josh  yo look  I'm a loser  when it comes to girls  and tomato shit  wasn't funny  there you go  we didn't say that  we're not  I'm saying that  no we're not  no  oh you gotta  you gotta  you gotta build that  confidence up  yeah we're trying to like  knock you down a bit  to make ourselves feel better  but besides that  we're also  no  see this is all I wanna know  you go out with your friends  do they  do they get girls  do they 
[03:42:30]  I guess yeah  oh okay  alright well  do you feel like a real loser  it's always a fat girl  yeah  is that what this is about  you feel like we're validating  the fact that you're a loser  and you're not funny  instead of just  what you're doing  is you're taking  you're taking it very very literally  like  the bit  let's be honest  maybe shouldn't  but instead of taking that in stride  like we're just goofing  like  yeah I got you  but  you're taking it very personally  yeah we  and you're allowing it to hurt you  we smashed your tomato bit  and made tomato sauce 
[03:43:00]  you know  yeah  right  so you wanna do radio right  like to yeah  but that's  alright  well there's nothing wrong with that  so you gotta expose yourself a little bit  not be afraid  it's not gonna hurt  right  what's so bad about it  you seem like a nice dude  would you allow us to bring a girl in here  and give you a lap dance  no sex  sure  so then why don't you discuss this stuff  I jerk off  a lot  big talk 
[03:43:30]  I'm just asking  good question  yeah sure  small  I guess  so what  I forgot  I honest to god  forgot that some people  look at sex  as like a personal  or weird thing  or shy about it  yeah  I honestly do forget that  you're gonna be alright Josh  yeah I'll be fine  you're not gonna give up are you  no  you're not gonna leave 
[03:44:00]  don't leave your internship  why would you do that  yeah don't do that  if Danny wants me to  he's just teasing me dude  no Josh  you gotta get a thicker skin  Josh is very  that's  you're right  you gotta get a thicker skin man  he's very thirsty  I thought I did I guess  I thought I did  like you should start by just talking about your  like um  masturbation habits  yeah you gotta  like you keep saying I'm done  I'm out but  it's  we're asking you something that we all admit to  it's not like we're asking you to be  to do something  um  that's  that's brutal  you know 
[03:44:30]  I'm just wondering if you  you know you say you do it a couple times a week  do your parents listen to the show  oh  is that what you're worried about  I'm done man I'm done  oh  done  what are you done with  yeah  I'm not sure what you mean  you're saying you're done  but we're not  I'm done talking about it I guess  about what  about the tomato bit  or sex  I'm honest to God I don't know  I think about uh  the masturbation thing  everything  everything 
[03:45:00]  but Josh we're trying to um  like break you out of your shell  seriously  you seem a little uptight  that might be one of the issues  that happens with the  the girl thing  do your friends  what are you laughing at  do your friends uh  like you said they get girls  you ever  you ever like  maybe  like one of the girls  that your friends is going out with  or something  well basically what aunt's asking  that's happened  have you ever like  hit in the closet while you're  friend is banging  nah cause sometimes it sucks  you see your friends all getting  fucking laid  and you just gotta sit there 
[03:45:30]  and go home and jerk off  it's fucking  degrading  yeah  who's the girl you like right now  maybe you can't say her name  but is there one girl  that you really like now  no  no?  there's no one you have your eye on even?  no  are you afraid you wouldn't get her?  gotta be  everyone's got like  their kind of dream girl  yeah who's your dream girl?  I don't know  dude what are you shutting down for  you're on the radio  it's so  just be open  I don't know  any uh 
[03:46:00]  no dream girl?  no not really  I'm depressed  I know you're making us feel bad  I know  now I feel  I'm like really sad  what the fuck is happening  at the end of every show now?  I don't know  Patty basically admitted to being touched by her father yesterday  oh really?  oh fuck  you missed our doozy yesterday 
[03:46:30]  who would her fucking father do?  it was her old 60 year old stepfather  or foster father  of course  tell Jimmy what  yeah quickly  one thing she brought up  is the fact that when she was 15  and she was in the bathtub  he'd come in the bathroom to shave  and she didn't like that  and she didn't like it  and he was like  oh stop it  he goes  oh you're a little girl  it doesn't matter  it doesn't matter  stop  it's like Carl Malden in Nuts  did anybody see that?  Barbra Streisand?  okay  and then  and then when they went on vacation  to like see  Stuck and Patty's aunt

[03:50:30]  really?  yeah  Josh  you're not giving up  right?  no  alright good  yeah don't give up  you're an only child  and do you get along  with your parents?  yeah  do they listen to this  show or no?  I don't know if they're  listening  they don't get XM  so  do you have an interest  in sex at all?  are you like  asexual?  no  you have an interest  in sex?  yeah  when you think of it 
[03:51:00]  do you think of it  with a girl that you  care about?  as opposed to  what is that?  a lesbian  oh okay  Josh do you think  about it with a girl  that you  oh it's funny  this is ridiculous  it's like some  almost E.T.  looking thing  it's E.T.  porno  chick is  for some reason  has a regular  human pussy  for the E.T. skin  yeah  oh  so Josh  when you think 
[03:51:30]  about sex  do you think  about it  with a girl  you care about?  like you look  at that as  something you  should do  with a person  that you care  more about  than as a stranger  sure  are you saying  that to shut  me up  or is that  the truth?  well Josh  you know  is that very  open?  this is the  longest two  hours of your  life isn't it?  yeah  are you mad?  nah  he's a little mad  tell me what's  going on in your  head  yeah be honest  dude  we're honest  come on  tell us what's  going on  I just try not  to think  I don't know  I just feel bad  about what? 
[03:52:00]  the tomato thing?  we're past that  what do you feel  bad about  for real?  yeah  the naughtiness  of jerking off  that one makes  you feel guilty  you have a lot of  guilt about that  don't you?  a little guilt  about that  how else are you  supposed to get  the poison out?  he probably does  something weird  he probably likes  to play with his  ass a little  he probably sticks  a finger up  his fart box  or something  so what?  I'll bet  that's what happens  he sneaks his  finger like  he probably  pretends he's  touching his  balls  but that little  middle one  it always mows  his back  doesn't it?  I know how it is  you always find  there's that

[04:03:00]  looks of him  right now  but  he was very  enthusiastic  about working  here  and actually  what I believe  was that he  didn't even  sign up to  work  at XM  but  he was a  K-Rock  intern  and he wanted  to work here  so much  stunt brain  brought him  over to  XM  with Steve's  permission  oh  that's true  so Josh  wow you put in  for a transfer  and  and this is  what happens  I guess  Josh  Josh  what'd you expect  on this show  yeah you gotta  stop Josh  you gotta chill  smile and take it  with a grain of salt  yeah

[04:11:00]  something tells you  Josh is feeling  very exposed  like  I'm telling you  this validated  something that he  was afraid of  or deep down  which he shouldn't  have  it was just  one stupid  bit  here's what  I think  I think  he thought  the first  tomato thing  was probably  going to go  over pretty  good  so then the  gay pride  questions had  to also be  tomato ones  right  and he'd  be like  the tomato  guy  bit  guy  it's a way  to stand  out  you know  how interns  always looking  for a little  niche to stand  out  right  and now you 
[04:11:30]  are tomato  guy but  now you're  pretty much  you know  retarded  tomato  guy  it's kind  of a weird  little twist  that it's  taken  yeah  so which  were any  of the guys  giving you  the business  about the  tomato bit  what do you  mean  like  were they  were they  teasing you  at all  or were they  encouraging  tomato jokes  pretty much  everyone said  they were good  so basically  you're feeling  like the guys  fucked with you  yeah  oh okay  so once you  have it out  with those  guys  Josh

[04:12:30]  pushing you  going yeah  yeah yeah  knowing it was  going to fall  flat and that  they were kind  of conspiring  to make you  look bad  yeah you could  say that  okay  I am saying  that so if  I know  that  so who  who was  the biggest  I'm saying  they could  walk  but I'm  asking you  what they  could do  is irrelevant  it's not  about them  I'm not  ratting  it's not  a rat  they didn't  do anything  wrong  ratting  is who  was laid  for work  we don't  know what's  not rat  that's  eroc  but that's  we're not  talking about  that  but we're  not asking  you to rat  because they're  not going to  get in any  trouble  I know  so that's  not ratting  name one 
[04:13:00]  Bob  Bob has  no problem  naming names  go ahead  Bob  I guess  I say  for myself  I was  actually just  ignoring Josh  because I  could not  I didn't want  to encourage  him nor  dissuade him  what was he  doing was he  doing tomato  jokes  yeah well he  was writing  and uh  and uh  you know  the what  testing them  out on the  other interns  oh  like who  cream pie  Jones  all of us  why is  your posture 
[04:13:30]  so good  wow you  are sitting  straight up  I used to  have very  bad posture  very poor  posture  wow who  straightened  it out  I guess  my mother  nagged me  too many  times  so  wow that  sounds like  a healthy  mother son  relationship  he would  have been  bending  tight like  Obama  alright so  what would  he do  explain what  would Josh  would do  do you  write  because he  won't  tell us  would he  write a  question  and try  it on  you  yeah that's  exactly what  he would  do  yes  he would  write his  questions down  and then he'd  go down  he'd give us  I guess a 
[04:14:00]  few of his  favorites  would you ask  him what  are you  working on  who reacted  the most  to his  questions  who reacted  the most  positively  yeah  who um  I guess  you could say  Sam  I knew it  was gonna  be Sam  I knew  it was gonna  be Sam  Sam  some people  are wondering  here Matt  from PA  wants to  know  if you're  gonna come  into work  with an  eye patch  one day  wow  some  linger-alonger 
[04:14:30]  people out  Josh is  mad at  somebody  I hope  it's not  us on  the air  but he's  mad at  somebody  because I  think he  feels like  he's been  set up  yeah  I think  that's  what's  bothering  him  like he's  going I'm  done I'm  done  because he  feels stupid  there's the  guy that  set you up  Sam  is that  it  Sam  will you  admit  I'm  not  saying  anything  here  you  just  said  you  would  what  are you  doing  you  gotta  ask Sam  some  questions  if he  was  fucking  with  you  that's  all  trust me  Sam's  replaceable  don't worry  about him  what  what is  it  you gotta 
[04:15:00]  tell us  now the  guy is  here  one of  the guys  is it  Danny  or is  it  Sam  who is  it  Josh  ask him  some  tough  questions  go ahead  like what  you know  what you  want to  ask him  why he  fucked  with  you  if  that's  the  one  who  you  feel  fucked  with  you  I  got  good  air  that's  why  I  don't  have  any  questions  who  was  it  what  would  he  do  to  fuck  with  you  people  would  say  it  was  good  and  I  believed  it  oh  see  it's  it's  a  trust  issue  of course  it is  he  feels  betrayed  he feels 
[04:15:30]  betrayed  and  yeah  okay  feels  a little  betrayed  you do  it's  all right  man  we  all  get  betrayed  no  it's  not  that  is  that  now  I'm  done  writing  questions  I'm  done  trusting  anyone  so  you're  going  to  hurt  yourself  because  you  what the  fuck  I'm  going to  come up  with more  questions  so this  happens  so why  not  what's  wrong  with this  happening  you're  on the  air  I mean  it is  entertaining  or it  is  fun  to  deconstruct  so  you're  saying  you're  only  going to  come up  with  questions  if you  guaranteed  home  runs  and you  want  to  be  in  this  business  and  not  take  any  risks  I'm  not  going to  trust  anyone  oh  Josh  that  was  funny  who told 
[04:16:00]  you  did  you  at  any  time  hear  his  questions  and  tell  him  that  they  were  indeed  funny  I  did  and  did  you  think  that  they  were  funny  yes  well  here's  the  thing  I  encourage  all the  interns  from the  get go  to  find a  niche  to get  out  there  to  start  the  easiest  thing  to do  is  to  get  on  the  street 
[04:16:30]  on  just  a  random  day  and  take  a  recorder  and  ask  questions  because  then  you  get  to  go  you  get  to  ask  questions  interact  with  people  practice  cutting up  the audio  the whole  thing  when an  intern  can come  to me  with their  very own  gimmick  and say  this is  what I'm  going to  do  here's  my  angle  on the  whole  thing  because  I tell  them  find  an  angle  we need  to  have  something  to air  we need  a reason  to air  it  you know  and so  he's  going to  say  well  I'm  going to  tackle  the  tomato  issue  and I'm  saying  this  is 
[04:17:00]  all the  other  interns  came to  me  with  audio  are  you  the  perpetrator  that  he won't  rat  anybody  out  are you  the guy  he's  talking  about  I hope  not  I didn't  I didn't  think I  lied  well he didn't  see you  lied  Josh  is it  Sam  is he  the one  that most  encouraged  you  like I  said  people  know  who  they  are  we  are  asking  you  this  trumps  any  of that  fucking  office  bullshit  this  is  not  a 
[04:17:30]  staples  in the  back  room  we're  asking  you  who  most  encouraged  it  they're  not  going  to  get  in  trouble  so  you  have  to  help  us  Sam  okay  that's  fine  Sam  he  just  ratted  you  out  that's  funny  see  Josh  almost  laughed  I  am  guilty  of  encouraging  a  young  intern  to  get  out  there  and  make  their  mark  on  the  world  so  you  looked  at  the  questions  and 
[04:18:00]  thought  they  were  funny  and  you  told  him  that  well  I  said  yeah  these  will  be  good  so  would  he  come  to  you  and  read  you  questions  like  would  he  do  a  couple  and  go  Sam  I 
[04:18:30]  and  what  what  kind  of  encouragement  would  you  give  more  tomato  questions  keep  going  if  that's  what  you're  going  with  keep  going  but  then  I  said  are you  going to  be  okay  if  by chance  they don't  find the  humor  in it  and he was  like yeah  I'll be  fine  so I was  like okay  that was a  just in case  scenario  Josh how  accurate is  this  is he  leaving out  part of  the  theme  or part  of the  vibe  of what  he said  no  that's  accurate  but  we can  kind  of  tell  he  might  be  being  slightly  sarcastic 
[04:19:00]  but  how does  that  make  you  feel  Josh  fine  I'm  alright  good  does it hurt  your feelings  a little bit  no not at all  come on  no  do you feel  stupid  no not at all  betrayed  no  how do you  feel  you're  obviously  angry or  upset or  something  yeah  you're saying  you're not  going to  come up  with questions  anymore  why would  you hurt  the radio  show  because  Sam gave  you a hard  time  no  not a hard  time  alright  because  Sam  does 
[04:19:30]  what  he  does  did  uh  was  Danny  approached  at all  with any  of these  at least  he was  honest  I certainly  was  what did  you say  I said  these  questions  are a  big pile  of  horseshit  I should  have  listened  and that  should  have  been  a clue  as to  where this  bit was  heading  but now  since you  were getting  encouragement  from other  people  you decided  to take  Danny's  advice  and throw  it away  and go  with the  people that  said that  you were  doing  like it  was good  and go  with the  wise  asses  the smart 
[04:20:00]  asses  in the group  Danny was  mean  what about  what about  E-Rock  did you  approach  E-Rock  with any  of these  questions  no  no  okay  what about  Steve  I might have  shown them  do you remember  what Steve  said  I think he said  they were good  ah  okay  so Steve  was also  fucking with you  Steve probably  did mean  Jimmy's right  yes  what about  Travis  I actually  get money  every time  someone clicks  on a tomato  link  from  foundry  a tomato 
[04:20:30]  link  oh shit  I gotta piss  don't go anywhere  just keep talking  how about  Derek  no  and not  Derek  no one else  no one else  it's mostly  Sam  so it was  pretty much  Sam  and Steve  he's the big  boss of all  this  and Steve  so why don't you  talk to Sam  for a second  Josh  I have nothing  to say  you have to have  something to say  what the fuck  dude  why'd you throw me  under the bus  like that  thank you for your  guidance  oh yeah  because I'll say this 
[04:21:00]  all the other interns  collected audio  and none of them  made it to the air  which if you ask me  is worse  wow  so  well  you have been in the  business for a  little while  so I've been three  years in this business  three years  yeah  in this business  did you ever hear us  on the show  talk about Sam  no not really  no  because I think  I've said on  numerous occasions  Sam  is probably  the biggest 
[04:21:30]  smart ass  motherfucker  that  and he looks like  the most innocent  but he is  the most notoriously  fucked  guy you'll ever  deal with  at times  not like always  he's not to be  trusted  that's not  everything is  a work  with him  he's trying  to fuck  people over  at every  turn  no  and I think  he nailed  you pretty  good on this  one  by encouraging  you  and then I  think your  pride also  because 
[04:22:00]  Danny told you  it was a  steaming pile  of horse shit  was it  something like  that  yeah  some kind  of  excretory  thing  but because  of your  pride  you didn't  want to  listen to  that  you'd rather  listen to  Sam  and you know  who said  it was good  and Steve  Steve you said  those questions  were good  yes he did  I actually  remember  the day  that Josh  brought these  questions  and Sam  was  it's like  9-11  yeah exactly  Sam was  Sam was  standing  about a  foot away  from me  as I was  about to  utter the  words  these  questions  fucking  suck  Sam was 
[04:22:30]  like  oh  Sam  stepped in  to save  the  yes  and then  I was  like  I don't  think  that  that's  accurate  at all  of all  the things  I fucking  forget  that one  I remember  that's  not  you guys  at this  point  I think  you guys  are done  playing my  games  with Josh  it's not  fair to him  to think  to paint  me as a  bad guy  in this  whole situation  is unfair  to both  of us  alright  well let's  let Josh  get out  of here  yeah  you alright  Josh  yeah I'm  good  Josh 
[04:23:00]  don't you  give up  alright  I'm serious  alright  Sam's an  asshole  what  yeah  Sam is  a douchebag  asshole  motherfucker  life's all  about learning  some lessons  and you  learned one  today  Sam's an  asshole  never to be  trusted  and I think  you should  do the  gay pride  parade  but you  do like  a variety  of questions  and leave  the tomato  thing alone  yeah  we're just  only 11 
[04:23:30]  or 12  tomato  questions  there's no  need to  get carried  away  with 300  well no  seriously  this is  before this  I might  not be  able to  make it  why  I'm going  to the  baseball game  in the afternoon  what's more  important  fuck the  baseball game  who are you  Charlie  Cheswick  you know  you want  to make a  mark in a  radio show  what baseball  game  the Yankees  you know  what  fuck them  you think  Gina would  take off  to watch  you radio  shit  fuck the  Yankees  those  motherfuckers  Jimmy  but baseballs  look a lot  like  they really  do  like fucking
