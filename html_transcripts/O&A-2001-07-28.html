<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about a Titanic-shaped inflatable carnival slide, which the hosts, Opie and Anthony, found darkly humorous given the historical tragedy.  This sparked a wildly inappropriate and offensive tangent where they brainstormed equally tasteless carnival ride ideas based on other disasters, including Columbine, Hiroshima, TWA Flight 800, the Donner Party, the deaths of Chandra Levy and JonBenét Ramsey. A caller, Raid, confirmed he’d taken his child on the Titanic slide.  The conversation then shifted to a caller, initially identified as Marissa (later Melissa), who graphically described her first experience with anal sex ("balloon knot action"). This ignited a sexually explicit discussion with callers Marie, Lisa, and Kimmy, detailing various sexual acts, positions, and the necessity (or lack thereof) of lubrication.

Following this, Kamal from The Jerky Boys called in, initially hampered by technical difficulties. He recounted a bizarre story about a violent altercation that allegedly inspired his signature scream. The conversation then turned to Kamal's directorial efforts on a softcore pornographic film, with an invitation extended to Opie and Anthony to participate.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Kamal's film and a brief recounting of Opie and Anthony's experience at a Spinal Tap concert, describing a "star-studded" audience but noting the band's unfriendly demeanor towards fans and staff, including a mention of an encounter with an actor from *Will & Grace*.

The next segment focused on a hypothetical VH1 "Behind the Music" style movie about Def Leppard, comparing it to *Spinal Tap*.  Opie, Anthony, and in-studio guest Jim Brewer engaged in homophobic and derogatory remarks targeting various celebrities and individuals, mocking their perceived sexuality, physical appearances, and drug use.  They imagined absurd scenarios for the Def Leppard movie, including missing limbs, band members as just heads, and violent clashes with other bands like Metallica.  Brewer contributed anecdotes about *Saturday Night Live* and its actors.  The discussion repeatedly veered off into nonsensical tangents, punctuated by vulgar language and interruptions.  The segment ended with further speculation and jokes about the Def Leppard movie, even suggesting a title change to "Hysterical."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  O.P. and the name.  1027.  P.C.C.W.  Phone numbers for New York, 877-692-1027.  For everyone else listening to us, you want to get a hold of the show, 866-277-4-WOW. 
[00:00:30]  All right, so the Titanic ride, Anthony?  Yeah, now you finally saw this.  We had talked about this beforehand, and I can't believe this is not an outcry.  We saw the website and everything, and I think there was a little article in the paper.  I have to tell you, when we were discussing this about a month ago, or even longer, I thought it was kind of a goof.  No, no, it's at carnivals.  I'm driving, I'm outside Huntington, and somebody was throwing a kid's party. 
[00:01:00]  And they had the Titanic slide set up, and kids were sliding down it.  It's this big inflatable slide, and it's shaped like the Titanic, but it's only a half of it.  Because it's tipped up, the stern way up in the air, way up in the air, and it looks like it's sinking into the ground.  Well, that's right, Anthony.  And the kids climb up a little ladder, and you're able to slide down the decks of the Titanic, just like the horrified, real-life human beings sliding to their death in the icy waters of the North Atlantic, bouncing off of the stacks. 
[00:01:30]  And when they get down, they go, I want to go again.  Right.  And they climb back up and slide down.  I saw a couple kids bouncing off the smokestacks.  Bouncing off the smokestacks.  This is something that really happened.  Yeah, it was a long time ago.  But thousands of people died in a horrible, horrible way. 
[00:02:00]  And now it has just come down to, if enough time goes by, not only can you joke about it, not only can you talk about it without having to be all somber, but you can now make a carnival ride out of it.  Right.  Look as the little children climb up to the slanted deck of the Titanic and slide down with smiles on their face, not unlike the real passengers with big smiles on their face.  Oh, wait, no, those were screams of horror. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, wait, no, those were screams of horror. 
[00:03:00]  So when they had to cut off his cancerous testicles and prostate, I was still able to impregnate myself with Renee's frozen sperm.  The frozen sperm bouncing into my egg, much like the Titanic bounced into that iceberg on that dark night in April of whatever effing year that was. 
[00:03:30]  And the people sinking slowly into the icy waters, much like Renee's frozen sperm slammed into my ice cold eggs.  The doctor who did the artificial insemination needed a extra long turkey baster to get past my huge camel toe that you see live in concert when I wear my jumpsuits. 
[00:04:00]  Doesn't my camel toe look like the bow of the Titanic slammed into my icy vatch?  I think so.  But it all comes down, when you add some years, it can be made into a carnival ride.  This goes to the many women that lost their lives on the Titanic, and mostly it is dedicated to the survivors.  I am Sam Feer, master of the pan flute. 
[00:04:30]  Try the TWA Flight 800 Flume Plunge, where we light the children on fire and send them plunging to their deaths.  Also the Hiroshima Fun House. 
[00:05:00]  Is that really my shadow, or that of a Jap burnt on a building?  What is it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But disasters can be fun, just like the Titanic.  Make sure you join us for Columbine Paintball.  It's great.  You run into a high school that looks just like Columbine.  Two people with trench coats chase you with paintball guns.  It's so much fun.  Ah! 
[00:05:30]  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Hey, I'm good.  Wee!  Hitler's Haunted Bunker.  Laugh along, both Gentile and Jew, as you go through Hitler's Haunted Bunker.  Why?  Enough time passed for the Titanic.  Where's the line?  See, I'm making a point here.  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee! 
[00:06:00]  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  There are plenty of disasters.  Let's all ride.  Raid makes a great point on line eight.  Raid, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Your kid slid down the Titanic slide.  Yeah, last year at the Sussex County Fair, my son went down that.  And the funny thing is, before he gets on, they're like, hey, you can't come on here with  your sneakers on.  You've got to take your shoes off.  I'm like, hey, this isn't bad enough taste as it is, but the kid's got to take his shoes  off to pretend he's dying on the Titanic. 
[00:06:30]  That's great.  Do they have old people to trample over and push out of the way like they did to the lifeboats?  They should have, like, hire old people on the deck of the Titanic to push out of the  way.  Squirt them with a hose till the old bastards drown in the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  I wonder if they hose down the kids with really, really cold water before they hose them  down. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, God.  That is awful.  That's great.  We also have little games for them to play at the carnival.  We have Jean Benet Ramsey Whack-A-Mole, where you beat her over the head with a replica  of her father's junk.  Larry, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  And enjoy the food.  It's the Donner Party Buffet. 
[00:07:30]  $4.99 a person.  What about the Chandra Levy hide-and-seek game?  Oh, now that is truly in bad taste.  Oh, yeah.  Not enough time has passed by.  See, I'm not learning.  The fun part, she never gets to yell, ollie ollie oxen free.  Because she's dead.  Larry.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey.  I came by a farm and picnic the other day, coming back from the store, and I saw this 
[00:08:00]  thing, and I saw this ship, and I said, what is that thing?  And my wife says, I don't know.  It looks like a ship.  And I thought it was cast deflated.  But when I drove by it, I said, oh, that's a Titanic.  That's a Titanic ride.  For the love of God.  And if the kids are too young to play on the Titanic ride, remember, you can go in the  William Shatner kiddie pool.  Bill Shatner will stand as lifeguard and do nothing as you drown. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Allegedly.  Look at that poor little bastard struggling for his life.  I'll just stand there and call the cops in about 0 and 0.  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony.  Oh, this guy's got a great line.  Anthony.  Yes.  Go.  I want to know if they close the gates to all the poor kids and let the rich kids go  first.  They lock him up in the bilge.  You look in the lower portion of the Titanic ride. 
[00:09:00]  There's poor people down there covered in coal dust.  Sean, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Listen, you forgot about the Susan Smith car flume which goes into the water with the  kids in it.  Oh, God.  Hey, why not?  Now people are going to be like, now that's outrageous.  But how much time has to pass before it's in good taste?  Well, it actually reminds me of another game that I thought was really fun.  It's the Oklahoma City bombing game.  And if you win the game, you're carried away by a crying fireman. 
[00:09:30]  It's awful.  But I mean, why is the Titanic any different?  Why the hell can they make a ride out of it?  Just because enough time went by that you make a ride?  Could you imagine a Flight 800 flume?  Come on.  Today's lunch special.  Sharon Tater tots.  Yes, the Manson experience.  Where the little kids get the clown like Charles Manson to paint their faces up with little 
[00:10:00]  swastikas on their head.  Bob writes, I can't wait for the Puerto Rican Day Parade lawn sprinkler game.  Those aren't water weenies.  Let's go to Greg.  Greg, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.N.A., what's up?  Hey, man.  Congratulations on syndication.  Oh, yeah.  That's happening.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Don't forget the Paula Poundstone slumber party.  Oh, God.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Oh, see? 
[00:10:30]  Well, that's too new.  That's horrible that you said that.  Much too new.  There's also the new Navigator game where they cover you in banana juice and allow four  baboons to attack you in the Navigator.  Oh, wow.  That happened yesterday.  That's awful.  Oh, you're going to get copyright on it quick before you jump on it.  Man.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, you get the point.  Phew.  And, of course, yes, the Ted Kennedy log flu.  You'll go with your girl, but only you'll come out. 
[00:11:00]  And you can win a JFK Jr. Kewpie doll.  Oh, wait.  They really have that.  Did you see this?  In the post.  Yeah.  JFK Jr. little Kewpie doll.  The Danbury men putting it out.  It's little JFK Jr. saluting like he did at his dad's funeral.  It looks like one of the Beatles in that, doesn't it?  Not the one with rain too much.  You know what ride I go on, Anthony? 
[00:11:30]  It's the Rockaway Beach Wave Pool.  Oh, God.  That was, that's still on the cover of the New York paper.  That's why I'm here, baby.  That's horrible.  Tragic.  Three girls drowned in Rockaway Beach.  It's just a ride.  My God.  You know, lifeguards are sleeping.  I don't know what happened.  That is awful because that's too new.  You have to wait.  Maybe 80 years from now, they make a ride out of it.  Because that seems to be what happens.  There's some great ideas for kid games on the phones. 
[00:12:00]  We might have to go right to the phones after break here.  Join us at the Phil Hartman Shooting Gallery.  Oh, no.  Ding, ding.  Ow, that hurt.  Hey.  Dad, I wish I knew her name.  The Houston Mother Dunk Tank.  Dad, I can't remember the name.  Oh, five kids in a tunnel.  You might remember me when I was alive.  Sorry, Jay.  It's close to home, doesn't it?  Okay.  I still feel bad about Rockaway. 
[00:12:30]  Wave.  Well, you should.  I'm like, those are someone's kids.  I know, see?  That person could be listening.  We're making a point here.  There was a point to be made.  The Titanic ride is no different than any of these other tragedies.  It's inappropriate.  Thank you, Jay.  All right.  We better take a break.  There you go.  O.P.  Anthony.  1027.  W.N.E.W.  212-757-1027, Anthony. 
[00:13:00]  We have to go to Marissa, who's been patiently holding here.  Marissa?  Marissa.  Marissa.  Marissa.  It says Marissa online.  Marissa.  It's actually not my real name.  It's my, um, Marissa Manor.  That would be my porn name.  All right.  That's your porn name?  Yeah, you remember, first, middle name, first name of the street.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We did that a bit a while ago.  Yeah, a long time ago. 
[00:13:30]  All right, Marissa.  Marissa, I wanted you to...  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.  We know what you want to say, and I think you got to leave it to us so we can get this  on the radio.  Anthony, if you will.  Okay.  Um, it says last night was the first night you ever did blank.  Balloon knot action.  Very good.  Just call it...  Welcome to the club.  Just call it...  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, yeah.  That would be correct.  She was a hoer.  Can you make yours breathe like the girl from the other day, though? 
[00:14:00]  Nah, I don't have those other skills.  All right.  All right, Marissa.  Melissa.  Melissa.  Melissa.  Could someone fix that on a goddamn screen?  How am I supposed to go into a goddamn death dedication?  Hi.  All right, there you go.  Melissa.  Apparently the person who wrote it was Japanese.  Marissa.  Oh.  Oh.  So, now, last night, the first night you got balloon knot action.  How old are you?  27.  27. 
[00:14:30]  And what made you wait so long?  Um, I don't know.  I was always very afraid to do it.  Yeah, how did this guy, uh, weasel his way, uh...  Yeah, how did he talk you into it?  Yeah.  He didn't have to talk me into it.  What do you mean?  He didn't have to talk me into it.  All he did was, you know, flip a couple of s*** in and...  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Not sure how much of that is going to get through.  Slow down.  We can't even really have descriptions that are anything more than completely vague. 
[00:15:00]  So, what he did was, um, first there was, uh, maybe a few digits involved.  Let's just say some digits involved.  Some manual labor, perhaps.  Right.  Manual labor.  Yeah.  And that led to you saying, hey...  What the hell?  I think, you know, if, uh, if that's possible, then the other thing's possible.  Yeah, well, actually, we had discussed it earlier in the day.  I told him I had never done that.  And he told me that he had never done that.  How much?  A couple of digits and then a punch in the face, Opie?  There you go.  They're ready.  They're loosened up.  How much alcohol was involved? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  None.  None?  Look at you.  Alcohol makes it better, though.  Wow.  And we got plenty in here.  So, uh, Melissa?  Yes.  How did you enjoy it?  Um, it was, it was really, really good.  Oh!  It was a ho-er.  Wow.  So, you, you like it now.  Yeah.  Like, what was I waiting for?  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Point the swing! 
[00:16:00]  Ouch.  Did he, did he give you the reach around?  Um, of course.  And now you, uh...  Yeah, you're into it.  How were, how were you positioned?  Doggy style.  Did that get through?  See, no, no.  It totally got through, but everyone just kind of, everyone stopped, didn't talk, and pictured it.  Yeah.  All right.  Now give us a little description of yourself.  Okay.  Um, let's see.  I'm 4'10", 250.  No, no, no.  I've read the whole thing.  Um, about 5'5", um, 130. 
[00:16:30]  A lot of back hair?  No.  Yeah.  Strawberry blonde.  Nice.  Okay.  Strawberry blonde.  Blue eyes.  So delicious.  Yeah.  Um, let's see.  Very, very large chest.  Really?  How large are you talking?  Um, 38 triple D.  So you're used to getting the TF, right?  Actually, I don't like that.  What?  At all.  What?  Because it's not for you, honey.  The TF is not for you. 
[00:17:00]  Who is you?  I don't like it.  The TF isn't for you.  The U.  It's for the guy.  Well, I'm really good.  I'll leave you a little something when he's done.  I'm really good at other things, so.  Oh, really?  I don't really need to do that here.  I bet you are.  Ah, so, um, very good.  Pure debauchery.  That, that is a very nice story.  You're, you're welcome to the wonderful world of balloon knot pleasure.  Yeah, and I just hope that all my co-workers at, um, at the laboratory are not listening. 
[00:17:30]  Nah, not many people listen to this show.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, not too many, right?  Nah, nah.  And they, and you're using the fake name Melissa.  Oh, yeah.  Melissa, her real name is Barbara.  What were the other things you said you were good at?  Um, do I have to say?  I don't think I can say it.  Well, no, no.  You said everything else.  You don't have to spell it out.  You said you were good at certain things.  Was it bobbing for dignity?  Is that what we did?  Yeah, we did.  There you go.  You're, you're good at that.  Now, did he use something, uh, any type of, um... 
[00:18:00]  Lubricant?  No.  No?  Didn't need to.  Wow.  You guys are all...  Prison lube.  Oh, nice.  Didn't need that.  Didn't need that.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Did he do that first?  All right.  And you're nice and clean back there?  No hair or nothing?  No, no.  I'm completely shaved.  And you felt like you had to share this with us today.  Man.  I had to. 
[00:18:30]  We love our listeners.  That rocks.  Thank you, Melissa.  You're welcome.  All right.  And you guys, I love you guys.  Well, we love you.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I have to take a shower.  Oh, yeah.  Feeling dirty?  I feel filthy.  All right, we're going to let you go, okay?  What a great little story.  Bravo.  Yeah, that was a good one.  The old dirt road, they call it.  The long and wide, yeah.  That's a winner.  How's that for a topper?  Oh, ho, ho, ho. 
[00:19:00]  Marie doesn't want to rain on our parade.  Marie.  Yeah.  What's going on?  I just wanted to call.  I hate to rain on your guys' parade, but that girl was totally full of it.  Why?  There's no way that she had balloon knot action and didn't use any kind of lube.  It's impossible.  No, it isn't.  It is possible.  No, it isn't.  Take Kimmy's word for it, please.  Listen to Kimmy.  Marie, you are ruining it.  Marie, you never heard of a natural lube?  Yeah, but she said she didn't use anything. 
[00:19:30]  No, natural lube.  Just the heat of the moment makes its own.  You know what I mean?  Well, if she could do it, I don't know.  I don't believe it for a second.  I did it for the first time the other day, and there's no way.  Well, let's hear about it.  What happened?  Maybe she had a smaller applicator.  Yeah, maybe she's going out with an Asian guy.  Now, Marie, you had balloon knot action first time a couple of days ago.  And how old are you?  20.  You're 20, and how did he talk into it? 
[00:20:00]  Was there booze?  No.  No?  No.  Some people earn it after a while.  Earn it.  So he's put in his time.  And how did he make the move?  Excuse me?  Anyway.  Oh, ask.  Ask.  How did he make his move?  He just asked.  He asked you?  Nicely.  He asked you?  That's all it takes to ask nicely, huh? 
[00:20:30]  Well, you know, if you put in your time and you earn it, then, you know.  So now you have a decision to make right after he asks.  It's going through your head.  You know you've never done this before.  Or what's going through your mind?  Well.  That you said, yeah, what the hell, give it a shot.  Yeah, basically.  And how did it go?  It went well.  It went very well.  Now, he started out with maybe some manual action.  Yeah.  And then worked his way.  If he was counting on his hands, what would he have counted up to? 
[00:21:00]  Two.  Two?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm just holding up two fingers and looking at it.  All right.  That's good.  That's good.  And then he decided, all right, you're ready.  Yeah.  And you used a lube?  Yeah.  What'd you use?  Well, baby oil.  Baby oil.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And how did it go?  Did it hurt?  It's called baby oil.  It's supposed to be used on babies.  I mean, come on.  You're a little too old for it. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, okay.  So it was nice and slow and after 13 hours.  It didn't hurt.  Well, I mean, yeah, it does, but, you know.  Hey, Melissa's back on the line.  Melissa.  Hi.  Hi.  Marie's saying you're full of S.  I hear that.  Well, if maybe her boyfriend got her as wet as mine did.  All right.  Hold on.  What was that?  I totally missed that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They had a dump out of that.  Damn it.  Oh, sorry.  They're fighting over the anal pleasure. 
[00:22:00]  And whose boyfriend gets them hotter for it?  Right.  Well, maybe it wouldn't need to accommodate as much as I did.  So, you know, some girls are luckier than others.  Like, I don't know about that.  I don't know about that.  Don't accommodate as much.  Oh, I see.  Now she's talking up the boyfriend.  Right.  He's calling me the Mississippi River.  That's my nickname.  The Mississippi River.  You must be so proud.  Yes.  Well, Marie, are you like the Lincoln?  You know the Mississippi River is a little on the muddy side. 
[00:22:30]  It's all muddy.  Maybe he was looking at muddy water.  Well, you know, we could get all four of them in here and they could all just show up.  They could try it out.  Just show up.  Oh, man, River.  This is a first for our show.  Two girls arguing over the balloon knot pleasure.  The need or no need for a lubricant and a boyfriend size.  You can use it from one spot or the other very easily.  That would be all.  But remember, don't ever go from balloon knot to the coach.  You know, if that's true.  But I just don't think it is.  But if it's true, that's good for her. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, we didn't use anything that wasn't natural.  Okay.  Well, that's great.  I hope, you know, I hope you guys do it a lot.  This whole conversation is unnatural.  And congratulations to you, too.  Thank you.  I can listen to two girls talking about balloon knot pleasure for the next hour.  Please, I know.  Now you know the other girl is going to go home and graduate to the non-lubricated state now.  Yeah, maybe I need to give myself the challenge.  Exactly.  All right, Lisa wants in on this conversation here.  Lisa, you're on with Melissa and Marie. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, if you need lube, you're a loser.  Oh, why is that?  Oh, that's not right.  Take it.  No, honey, take it like a champ, okay?  Take it like a champ.  Yeah.  Now, what do you mean by that?  The whole point of it is getting it.  Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hold on, hold on.  Don't even go into anything that might be a little descriptive.  Right.  The whole point of it is to get it going without any help?  Right.  To park the car in the garage.  Are you into the pain of it or something? 
[00:24:00]  Just a little bit of pain, but usually, you know, a girl can have her own lubrication.  I mean, I have three other friends that, actually, their nicknames are Butt Plug, and they take  it, you know, they take it back a little.  When you got a nickname of Butt Plug, you pretty much know what you're getting.  Of course, the pain is deadened by the spade shovel to the back of the head.  That's the technique I like to use when they say ow.  Jesus Christ.  You girls rule, man.  Thank you, guys. 
[00:24:30]  I'd like to give my girlfriend an epidural before I do it.  I'll stick back in when there's round two, okay?  All right.  Okay.  Have a good day, guys.  Bye, Kimmy.  Thanks.  Bye.  Thanks, girls.  Bye.  Talisa, not Taloo.  Some people, some of the girls enjoy the no-lube because of a little pain.  Some like it.  I don't know.  It's a whole borderline thing.  I hope that didn't dump out.  Yes.  I hope that didn't dump out too much of that.  Why don't you just ask the expert?  Yes, Kimmy.  Well, when did you first experience the pleasure of Balloon Knot pleasure? 
[00:25:00]  A few years ago.  A few years back?  A few years back.  And how did you decide that this was the time and this was the guy?  It was something that I had in the back of my mind.  Hopefully, it was a few shots of Jägermeister.  Yeah, a little bit.  It helps you relax and you just, you know.  There you go.  And did you kind of just roll over and give that inviting look?  Or did he pull the ups?  Yeah.  Some guys are like, yeah, I didn't know.  And it's like, well, you're halfway there.  You may as well finish.  Go for the home run. 
[00:25:30]  Wow.  Right there in Kimmy's own outback.  There you go.  Nice.  Nice.  Did it make you arrive?  Yeah.  Can we say that?  Oh, yeah.  Very good.  I'm learning how to do radio one day.  Right on.  Thank you.  Yesterday, you would have been a filthy mess.  And if Norton was here, he'd be showing us how it's done.  I love him and his little bald head.  There you go.  And you enjoyed it.  It makes you arrive. 
[00:26:00]  Yes.  Because you know what it is?  It's a different kind of stimulation.  No, I don't know how it is.  You know, Anthony.  You know how it is.  You know, when you've got a big C up the A.  Hey, hey, oh, look who's in here now.  It's your Norton.  Norton.  I've got a head to rub.  Get over here now.  Yeah, a head to rub.  Insert joke here.  There you go.  You like that.  Jim, good to see you.  How are you, man?  Hey, Norton.  We're talking about balloon, not pleasure.  Balloon, not pleasure.  Yeah.  Girls are calling in saying they first had it like last night or a couple of days ago. 
[00:26:30]  And it's fascinating, the story of how they decide now is the time.  You know what it is?  It's a sneaky little thing in the back of your head.  And it's just, you know.  It's not in the back of your head.  It could be sneaky.  It could be little.  You just get a couple of drinks and you just blame it on the alcohol or it's something where,  like I said, the guy does a little slip.  The slip.  That's really how he, like, he just slips.  Like, he doesn't say anything to you.  But the slip means.  That's the most uncouth thing I've heard. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, and the slip means you're, like, totally going for it.  Like, it's, let's just count, one, two, one, two, one, two, one.  And, you know, he's like, yeah, whoa.  You can't, you can't, you can't slow down and all of a sudden get gentle with the slip move.  Because it's like, oh, it's an accident.  If you all of a sudden slow down and start being very slow and gentle, it's like, ah, you knew where you were going.  The slip move is like, ah, being pummeled. 
[00:27:30]  Ouch.  It's right.  It's kind of like when you're in the push-up position.  Yeah.  As me, as a woman would be in the push-up position.  I don't blame you.  The push-up.  Yeah.  The push-up position.  You're in a push-up.  Yeah.  So that way, you know, you're all arched or whatever.  And then it's easier because you're relaxed.  And it's kind of, you're not anticipating.  And then all of a sudden, everything's relaxed already.  Okay, let's just ponder that for a second.  Yeah, let's hold on.  Everyone, hold on a moment of silence for.  Oh!  We're in a steam! 
[00:28:00]  Ow!  Ow!  Three merciful crabs!  All right.  It's a push-up position.  This is legal, isn't it?  A little back arch.  And then.  And you're ready to rock.  And you're ready to rock.  And, um.  He doesn't ask you anything.  He doesn't say anything to you.  I mean, he doesn't prepare you.  He doesn't, like.  Okay, okay.  You know what?  I've done it more than once now, so it's like.  There you go.  Whatever time one.  Nice.  Usually I just say, you tell your parents, your sister's dead. 
[00:28:30]  Has the guy.  That's the easiest way.  Has the guy ever, let's just say.  How can I put this?  Has the guy ever prepared the area for you?  And let's just say, the way he's preparing the area, he wouldn't be able to whistle a tune as he's doing it.  He gives an oral dissertation.  You know what?  Let me tell you.  Mmm, I love that.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Look at him.  He puts his head in his hands.  I just met my wife.  Dude, that's what I was telling you about in the office. 
[00:29:00]  The dirty penny.  Oh, God.  Yeah, it tastes like pennies.  If anything's tasting like a dirty penny, you better go to a doctor.  Or a mushroom.  It tastes like mushrooms sometimes.  Mushrooms!  Yeah, shiitake mushrooms.  Hey, why aren't the girls making it out there?  I don't know, man.  To me, it tastes like baby powder.  I don't know.  Yeah, it's a callback.  I don't know what she gets a 24-hour callback.  Nice.  I don't even like this.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:29:30]  What are we talking about?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Hey, get with what we're talking about.  Balloon knot pleasure.  I was never a big balloon knot.  The first time I ever had it was with a girlfriend.  And it looked like, you ever step in mud?  Oh.  Can you pull your foot out of the mud?  Yeah.  That's what it looked like.  Well, you shouldn't have used your foot.  Well, I was like doing a Duncan Hines commercial.  I was so irritated.  It's true.  I had to use a towel and wipe off with a towel and throw the towel down the sewer.  Oh, that's so wrong.  Gymnast.  That has happened.  Sorry, too. 
[00:30:00]  Disgusting.  What alley did you throw the towel at?  Right.  Yeah, okay.  That was called Exhibit B.  Well, jeez, Norton, did you burp her first at least?  I mean, come on.  You didn't save the towel to wipe the mace off your face?  Give her a brand mug next time.  Did you know?  Wow.  Ronnie Dangerfield should be here in minutes.  Hey, let me tell you about my balloon knot.  In about 20 minutes.  I've got to tell you.  Can we all just ponder that for a moment, too? 
[00:30:30]  Let me see.  Oh, Jimmy from New Jersey, Anthony, really fast?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I just can't decide if I'd rather listen to 56 more hours of Mike and the Mad Dog talking  about 61, the new movie about Mantle and Maris, or Kimmy from Survivor talking about having  a big C in her A.  Why don't we talk about that, Mikey?  I don't understand it.  I'm a fan.  We ought to do that.  We get better ratings.  And we talk about how's your balloon knot there, Mikey?  What about the first time you had a balloon knot?  Pleasures, Mikey. 
[00:31:00]  What was it?  A couple of digits first?  If we want to keep it on the sports field.  How about a baseball bat, Mikey?  I got an autographed baseball bat here.  Mike Piazza, baseball bat, Mikey.  Bend over.  Time for some balloon knot pleasures.  How are we supposed to win in the ratings if we can't talk about balloon knot pleasure?  Mike from Queens.  You're on the phone talking about balloon knot pleasure.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back. 
[00:31:30]  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Kamal from the Jerky Boys is on the hotline, Anthony.  Kamal?  Come on.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  What are you doing?  I go to dentist. 
[00:32:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That was fun.  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, Mike!  I'm bleeding and he punched me.  Ah!  Why do you must punch at me so much?  You have to spend a while over the sky.  I got to tell you, the dental malpractice one, probably one of the funniest ones that I've  ever heard.  I don't know.  I like the Frank Rizzo stuff.  Oh, of course.  The Frank Rizzo stuff.  Very popular. 
[00:32:30]  But are you guys speaking yet?  Let me tell you something.  Yo, yo, yo, yo.  You know how I came up with that scream?  You know how I came up with that scream?  How?  It's a crazy story, man.  When you were getting up the poop show?  Stop it, Opie.  I know.  It was your mom.  She was putting her thumb in my ass.  Oh, very nice.  Yeah.  She says, it's even tighter than my son.  She'll do that.  Yeah.  So check it out.  Back about 10 years ago, I had this pizzeria in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, my peeps, my father's from Bangladesh. 
[00:33:00]  There was a nutty Bangladeshi guy living, you know, living on the top floor.  Yeah.  I'm sleeping in the back.  I was in the first floor.  It was like three in the morning.  And I think I'm dreaming hearing my name being screamed out.  Uh-huh.  And then I wake up going, that ain't a dream.  That's someone screaming my name.  I go to the door.  I look far down the hallway.  It's this, you know, the Bangladeshi guy being caught in between the two doors.  He's just a big crackhead.  He was beating the living piss out of the guy.  Like, I never seen a guy get an idea, screaming out, going, come on. 
[00:33:30]  No way.  Kamal.  Yeah?  Kamal?  Hello?  Kamal.  Where'd he go?  I think we lost Kamal from the Jerky Boys.  If he's listening.  If he could call back, we'd appreciate it.  What happened to the phone?  I don't know.  He must be on a cell phone or something.  Kamal.  Hello?  What happened there?  Wow.  He's back on.  Oh, okay.  Kamal.  Kamal.  Yeah, can you hear me?  Yeah, what happened?  I don't know.  Were you in your car or something?  No, no.  I'm not calling from the cell phone. 
[00:34:00]  That's weird.  Yeah, so the guy was screaming, and that's where those, those, ah, and all that came from.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, so I was just copying this guy getting beat up.  And I chased after the guy with a bat.  And I ended up knocking out.  With a bat?  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  Kamal.  Kamal.  God damn it.  Boy, I...  Kamal.  Kamal.  Kamal. 
[00:34:30]  Kamal.  Yeah.  What's that clicking?  Kamal?  Hello?  Hello?  Kamal.  What's going on?  What's that clicking?  What do you got?  Like, um, caller...  I don't know.  I got all this, I got all this nutty stuff on my phone, you know?  No, something's clicking, and then you're like...  And then you get cut off.  We don't hear you, and then all of a sudden you're back?  I don't know, man.  I don't know what's calling on.  See if there's another call on the line.  Home.  All right, we'll wait.  Home.  Yeah, so, yeah, that's a silly story anyway.  Yeah.  So what's up?  Hey, listen, I called to ask you guys a question, man. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  You know that chick that makes all the hats Ivy Supersonic?  No.  You don't know what she was number on your show?  No.  All right, I'm directing this soft porn thing with her in it, and we're putting all rock  stars in it.  You're doing a porno?  No, I'm directing it.  Believe me, if I showed my tool, it would be in a hardware magazine over there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, but check it out.  Do you guys want to be in it?  It's going to be like tons of naked chicks, celebrities.  Do we want to be in a porno?  Yeah, no, you don't have... 
[00:35:30]  Thankfully, I don't want you guys naked in the thing, you know?  Do we want to be in a soft porno that Kamal from the Jerky Boys is now?  That's right.  Well, if they see you naked, they will be soft.  Is this your directorial debut?  No, no, no.  I've already directed a few things, actually.  What did you direct?  I directed this documentary called Artists of Hell's Kitchen.  You directed Johnny out of your life.  That was pretty easy.  What's Johnny doing?  I got no idea, man.  You don't ever even speak with the other Jerky Boys.  Let's talk to Johnny. 
[00:36:00]  What happened?  We'll call him up.  Let's go.  Let's get him on the phone.  Let's settle the differences now on the radio.  Yeah, there's no...  You know, the thing is, it's like...  We want Frank Rizzo.  What happened between you two boys?  Yeah, what happened with you and Frank...  Hello?  Kamal?  Johnny.  Oh.  Kamal?  What the hell?  Whatever happened?  Kamal, Kamal.  I don't know.  You guys are doing something...  We're not doing anything.  Not a thing.  We were big Jerky Boy fans growing up. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, we mean growing up.  You guys are my age.  What are you talking about?  We're 67 years old.  That's right.  Yeah, well, you know, if you guys want to be in it, please be my guest.  It's going to be tongue-to-roll.  I got to know where Johnny is.  We want to talk to Johnny.  Frank Rizzo.  Frank Rizzo?  I don't know.  Where's Johnny?  He lives upstate in the country.  Not really upstate.  He lives in, what is that, Washingtonville or something like that?  But you had a good thing going, the Balthiers, and something had to come between you.  We would love to know what broke up the Jerky Boys.  It's that green stuff you put in a wallet. 
[00:37:00]  Ah.  It wasn't a Yoko Ono thing?  No, I have talent.  He probably felt his...  Ah!  Did he feel that his characters were better than yours and he wanted more money?  Well, it started out like on a friendship kind of thing, and then when money got in  a way like it turned to something else, but...  Here's my take on it.  That's a long time ago.  I think Johnny was probably getting more money than you.  Oh, no, no.  He did get more money.  Yeah.  I never said he didn't.  And it pissed you off? 
[00:37:30]  No, never.  Never.  It never pissed you off?  So then what happened?  See, my whole thing is this.  Everyone could make money in this country.  Yeah.  You know?  And my father came in as an immigrant, made a lot of money in this country doing his own  thing, and he told me, hey, you got guys mopping up, you know, mopping in peep show theaters.  People do that for a living.  You're making funny phone calls and getting paid for it?  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  And so I never looked at it as, oh, he's making more money than me.  But it just turned into something that wasn't cool, you know, I mean, I don't know, maybe 
[00:38:00]  one day we're on the mood I'll talk, but.  Hey, come on.  Yeah.  Is this call going to be on your next prank call tape?  No.  You guys want to be in a soft porno movie?  Soft porno, huh?  Yeah.  Wait, you don't want to go the distance?  I guess if I shoot you naked, it'll be one of those short movies, sir.  Ah.  You don't want to go the distance and just get the hardcore effing big.  What?  You mean the.  I think the last time I came on, I told you, what was that? 
[00:38:30]  You know, go the distance with the A-F-ing and the T-F-ing and every kind of F-ing.  No, because like, I'm going to try to sell this thing on TV with some movie guys I'm working  with, you know?  Like, you know, when you watch the cable, they show like those videos for sale that  the girls will take off their shirts all over the place.  All over the country.  Yeah, I think those are stupid.  Who wants to see a girl's boobs and that's it, you know?  I'd rather see the whole, you know, the whole stuff, you know?  Exactly.  Hey, come on, what happened to that CD you put out?  Yeah, where did that go? 
[00:39:00]  It was out for what, a week?  No, it's still out, man.  It's picking up.  Did anyone buy it?  Uh, not really.  Johnny bought it.  Not really.  I think it's a lot of people don't know about it, you know?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  But you guys played some of it, you know?  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah, you know?  But, uh, it's out there, it's good.  I think it's better than the last two Jerky Boy records, to tell you the truth.  I had a problem with my effin' boss.  That's what, uh, Kamal's saying.  Nah.  You know what the thing is? 
[00:39:30]  What?  Yeah.  Everyone in your country is...  Kamal?  Hello?  Hello?  Okay.  Kamal?  Hello?  Stay back!  Kamal?  Hello?  Stay back!  Hello?  Okay, terrific. 
[00:40:00]  What the hell happened to you?  Okay.  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yeah.  Come on.  How'd you like to mow my lawn?  I don't know what's going on, but I keep getting disconnected.  Yeah, that's a little weird.  Well, check it out.  Do you guys want to be in it, or what?  Most people get the hint at this point.  I have my people talk to your people.  If you want to be in it.  Serious.  No, it'll be fun.  It'll be a bunch of laughs.  Can I get some, uh, herpes or AIDS or anything like that?  No, you're not going to be, like, sexual.  It's going to be like...  If I'm going to be in a softcore porno, I want to do some effin'. 
[00:40:30]  No, there's going to be, like, naked models in a thing, and all you've got to do is just  hang out, you know?  Should we bring all our shoes and glasses so we have them?  No, no, that's the other guy.  Oh, that's fine.  Save those jokes when the other guy calls the jokes.  Oh, I love that guy, you guys.  I love the song.  You're going to have fluff girls there, at least?  Yeah, I hope, man.  Give us a little something in between.  My towel will be a little fluffing.  Frank Rizzo!  Frank Rizzo.  Look, Jerky.  What the...  Why do you insult me when I'm calling you?  Hello? 
[00:41:00]  I was half of a comedy team, and now I'm making porno.  Yeah, but, uh...  My stakes are going up.  Oh, what happened?  I was in a movie.  Remember the Jerky Boys movie?  Well, now I'm making a movie that has naked girls, isn't it?  And all of a sudden, now I'm directing pornos.  Hey, I go to where the money is, babe.  I hear you.  You know what I'm saying?  Bam!  Bam!  Bam!  Yo, what's up? 
[00:41:30]  Yo, what's up, my sweet little bitch?  Oh, my ass.  It's tearing the ass out of me.  Oh, I'd like to put him in a porno movie and tear the ass out of me.  What a plunger.  Hey, did you see that Insane Clown Posse movie?  Hey, what are you guys going to be on behind the music, huh?  The one where they were banging?  Yeah, well, you've got to hear me play the bass, man.  I'm one of the greatest bass players in rock and roll history.  I play the bass guitar. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, you'll see.  I'm telling you, my fingers fly on that thing.  All right, well, we'll have to consider the soft porno with...  Yeah, my fingers will be flying on that thing, too.  With the guy from the Jerky Boys.  Yeah, so if you guys want to beat it, I'm serious.  No jokes, man.  I think you guys, look, I'm dead serious.  I think you guys took over New York.  Yeah.  You know, I'm very disappointed with you.  Very disappointed.  Yeah.  I think you guys are...  With what other guy?  The Frank Rizzo guy?  No, he's talking about the other...  Hey, what happened? 
[00:42:30]  Hello?  Kamal?  Kamal.  Kamal.  What the hell is wrong with the phones today, Anthony?  Kamal.  Kamal.  Kamal.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Damn it.  You know what I'm saying?  Darbosh!  Bye!  All right, guys.  So what's up, man?  You guys want to grab a beer or what?  Were you the Egyptian magician guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that...  Oh, okay.  Darbosh!  Darbosh.  And I was working right across the street for you for a month.  Were you like Kissel, too?  Were you over at Associated Grocery making my sandwich?  Yeah, right in that building.  There's a thing called e-yata.com. 
[00:43:00]  I know, you're being funny right now with the supermarket.  I was going to smack you to your head on the left side.  Oh, he hit me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And knocked my glasses off.  I was beating about the head and neck.  I'll punch you so hard, your kids will be born dizzy.  Oh, is this thing working?  Oh, I love it, man.  Whoa.  Hey, you guys like German food?  What?  This is a new record, by the way. 
[00:43:30]  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Yeah.  Hey, why don't we give this friend of mine that owns a German restaurant a prank?  What do you got, a Sports Illustrated football phone over there?  No, no.  Can't you, guy?  You got it.  You know, I don't want to give the guy's number on the air.  No, no, don't do that.  You don't want to do that?  Come on, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  How are you able to call back so fast?  What, because I know how to dial a number?  That is fast.  Yeah, you know what I'm saying? 
[00:44:00]  Now watch.  Like the second you get this connected.  Yeah, watch.  When I hang up on you.  1-100, 2-100, 3-100, 4-100, 5-100.  He's bad.  Yeah, there.  Come on.  Hello.  You are fast.  What is it, redial?  Well, fortunately, the girls don't say that.  You're doing the redial thing?  No, you're a guy over there.  I think you guys are clowning around getting rid of me, but he keeps putting me back on.  Oh, okay.  You know?  How would you like to do that?  So you don't want to do that prank or what? 
[00:44:30]  What prank?  Well, call this German restaurant in my neighborhood.  He's a big fan of yours.  Oh, you want to do like prank calls together and stuff?  Yeah.  You want to do that?  Put out an album.  The Jerky Trio.  Yeah, we'll be like the Mills Brothers or something like that.  And then people will say, hey, where's the Frank Rizzo guy?  And we'll be like, oh, he's gone.  Like Skid Row without Sebastian Bach.  The album will be called...  That guy's doing Broadway now.  The album will be called Opie Anthony and the Unfunny Guy from the Jerky Boys.  No, stop.  What the hell are you doing over there? 
[00:45:00]  You're like the other guy from Wham.  Oh, man.  Andrew Rizzo.  Are you all right trying to diss me?  What about you, man?  Come on.  I'm a fan of you guys.  I'm calling you up out of the blue.  You guys...  Yeah, this was definitely a treat.  Come on.  It wasn't a treat.  Hey, listen.  If you guys want to be in it, think about it.  I'll call you back in a week.  If you want, I can send some models over there.  Yeah.  That are going to be in this thing.  No strip on your show.  Well, come on.  We've got to cut you off because Jesse Camp is waiting to get on the air.  Okay. 
[00:45:30]  He's going to be in it, too.  All right, come on.  All right.  See you later.  All right.  Call back anytime.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Bye.  Anthony Flaming Arrow from Staten Island.  Yeah.  You would think that if one guy would know when somebody was effing with him over the phone,  it would be Kamal from the Jerky Boy.  Yeah, right?  Isn't the funniest thing is just doing all of Johnny's impressions for Kamal?  Very good. 
[00:46:00]  I want to thank Kamal for checking in today.  Jerky Boy.  O.B.  Anthony.  O.B.  Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Phone numbers for New York, 877-692-1027.  For everyone else listening to us, you want to get a hold of the show, 866-277-4-WOW.  How was Spinal Tap last night, Anthony? 
[00:46:30]  Oh, rock!  Yeah?  Yeah, I had a lot of fun, man.  Spinal Tap.  Saw him last night at the Beacon.  Had a star-studded audience, Opie.  A lot of people were there?  Star-studded.  Was it the place to be last night?  It seemed to be the place to be, yes.  For the likes of Penn from Penn & Teller.  The guy from Will & Grace.  Will from Will & Grace.  Is he the gay guy?  He's one of the gay guys on the show, but I think he overcomes it out in public by just 
[00:47:00]  always being wrapped around his hot wife, girlfriend, whatever she is.  It's hysterical.  Yes, I'm gay on the show, but look.  I'm going to have a girl right here in front of you just to prove I'm not.  That's going to suck that you're the gay guy.  I'm going to hit sitcom if you're not gay.  Because you know the gay guys just probably come up to him all the time.  I just love you.  Get out of here, faggy.  So he ran into the gay guy from Will & Grace, but he's not gay.  I didn't run into him, Opie.  The way you make it sound, like I ran into him. 
[00:47:30]  But he's not gay because he was with his hot wife or girlfriend or something, and he  made sure everyone was checking him out when he was with his hot wife or girlfriend.  Right.  Okay.  Making sure.  I got it.  And I think he was trying to be a little bit of a tough guy in front of his girlfriend.  A little tough guy.  What, slapping around a little bit?  No, well, no, that would have worked, though.  That works, too.  No, he's sitting in his seat watching Spinal Tap, and his chick is on the aisle seat, right?  And he's next to her.  And some people were walking in the aisle, and his girl couldn't see.  So he kind of leans over.  His girlfriend taps the guy and goes, hey, she can't see. 
[00:48:00]  And the guy just turns around and goes, shut up, faggot.  He did not.  No, he moved.  He showed up, faggot.  But, uh, and then at one point they got up, and right before he sat down, someone threw  a drink in his chair.  So he sat, and his ass got wet, just like a real gay guy.  Come on.  Gay guy's sitting in seats that people have dumped water on or something. 
[00:48:30]  Anthony, we're on in San Francisco now.  Cut it out.  We've got to make a good impression for everyone listening to San Francisco.  We welcome everyone.  That's a winner.  We welcome everybody.  So what else happened at Spinal Tap?  Oh, we got a clip of, uh, somebody, uh, talking to, um, the guy from Will and Grace.  Friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something?  That's horrible.  That's not him.  So is Penn the one that talks or doesn't talk?  The big one.  Yeah.  The big guy that talks.  Okay.  That talks.  All right.  He was there.  Also, um, Stephen Van Zandt from, of course, the... 
[00:49:00]  Miami Steve.  E Street Band.  And The Sopranos.  And The Sopranos.  Now, everybody knows, more people are coming up to him asking him about, uh, taking pictures  with him, uh, because they know him from The Sopranos than, than from Springsteen.  And, uh, then he's talking to me about, he wants a show on WNW here in New York.  He wants to do a, what, a talk show?  No, he wants to do, like, a garage rock show.  Because we already have the Eddie Trunk show there, uh, Saturday night. 
[00:49:30]  And he does a good job with that.  No, it'd be like, you know, something on the weekend where, uh, he would do something.  I'm like, all right, you know, I'll talk to Ken Stevens for you.  Bada bing.  I'm just like, hey, he was pitching you a rock show.  I do you a favor, maybe you do me a favor.  Bada bing.  Does he understand we don't really play music anymore on this radio station?  That's something I don't know, see?  Yeah.  I, uh, no, I think he knows that, but I think he was pitching some kind of weekend show.  All right.  Yeah.  And, uh, Spinal Tap rocked. 
[00:50:00]  You know, they did all the hits, but they were kind of, I'm sorry, they're kind of dicks.  They really are.  Well, yeah, they blew us off yesterday.  They blew everyone off.  Everybody.  It's just amazing because, um, we presented the Spinal Tap show.  Opie and Anthony present.  Says it on the ticket.  We're concert promoters as well in our, in our spare time.  Yeah, for some reason.  I don't know what that entails.  We have presented, uh, Andrew Dice Clay in the past and now Spinal Tap.  So, uh.  At the garden. 
[00:50:30]  You would think if we're going to help them sell tickets for their show, because it wasn't sold out, right, Ant?  Yeah.  They would, uh, I don't know, maybe, you know, come down to the station and, uh, you know, hang on our show.  They blew us off.  Yeah, totally blew us off.  And, um, and I heard they were kind of dicks to their fans and backstage last night, huh?  We're hanging out backstage and it was hard enough for me to get a pass.  I got one pass.  And, uh, for me and my girlfriend.  And that was it.  I had my brother Joe, uh, Cowbell Bill hanging out, uh, Big Kev, Joe Curry. 
[00:51:00]  Everyone I went with had to sit out there and then I got my messages on the phone later.  Like, dude, man, I guess you couldn't get us in and stuff.  But, you know, it's cool.  I enjoyed the show.  So, I'm the, I'm the dick.  I'm the bad guy.  Now I'm the bad guy.  You need a person like me.  You need me.  I'm the bad guy.  You got to take care of your entourage, Anthony.  Well, I didn't see anybody.  I saw fleeting glimpses of people, uh, that were in Spinal Tap. 
[00:51:30]  The Anthony entourage.  My entourage.  My peeps.  I'm like P. Diddy.  I'm P. Diddy.  I'm P. Diddy.  P. Diddy.  So, I, I, I go back there.  I, I barely see Spinal Tap.  You know, the guys.  Mm-hmm.  Um, they leave through the back door to go to their limos.  There's people waiting outside for autographs.  Not a lot of people.  But there's, like, guys waiting out there for some autographs with some Spinal Tap memorabilia.  Nothing.  They walked right past them.  Right past them.  Maybe they were, you know, trying to be rock stars. 
[00:52:00]  Hey, look.  You know, you're taking your Spinal Tap thing a little too friggin' seriously.  Uh, it was a goof band, a movie, back in, uh, like, 1982, 83.  Maybe they're gay.  Maybe they're gay.  Hey, faggot.  Maybe they're...  Nice head, dicks.  Where you going?  You too big now, faggots?  You shocked on SNL, dick!  Jim Brewer in the studio.  Jim Brewer.  I'm late for you, faggy!  Were you on SNL during the time any of them were on? 
[00:52:30]  No.  No, they didn't?  They, yeah, they missed each other.  Right, right.  Really?  Michael McCann wasn't on, like, part-time thing?  He was on for, what, a season?  Yeah, I know.  All those guys are.  They were on for, like, ten minutes.  Yeah, Christopher Gass.  The only one that was on a short amount of time was Anthony Michael Hall.  Oh, God!  Do you remember that?  Oh, yeah, the Anthony Michael Hall month.  Wasn't that Julia Dreyfuss, too?  Yeah, yeah, she was on, sure.  Michael Anthony was on a tear, too.  I mean, he kind of had the gayish geek thing going, but you loved him. 
[00:53:00]  Because he got high in that movie.  He had that growth spurt, and it was all over.  And then all of a sudden, it was like, what happened?  Now I think he's in that...  He's on SNL.  I think he's in that movie, that Def Leppard VH1 production.  What?  Who's he playing?  I don't know who he's playing, but he's definitely in the Def Leppard movie.  I play the drummer's leg.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Def Leppard movie tomorrow night in VH1.  It's a VH1 movie.  It's a VH1 movie.  Like, they cast it in, or...?  No, no, it's not them.  They cast people as Def Leppard, which is hysteric. 
[00:53:30]  Where did they get the one-armed actor from?  I have no idea.  Arm, leg, whatever.  Arm?  No, I know.  But who cares?  I know my amputees.  Arm, arm, leg, whatever.  I know my amputees.  So, I saw some dramatic moments of him in the hospital, you know, and the fake Def Leppard  talking to him, you know, trying to act like Def Leppard.  We're still going to be a band.  Yeah, stuff like that.  We're still going to rock it.  We're still going to be a band.  We're not giving up on Def Leppard, no. 
[00:54:00]  We're going to still be a band.  Photograph will live on.  We'll be back with more of the Def Leppard story on VH1.  So, back to Spinal Tap.  Back in!  Back in!  Shut up!  Shut up!  How annoyed must the roommates at O.J.S. be?  Foodie, shut up, bitch, shut up! 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, here we go.  VH1, behind the music.  VH1 presents Def Leppard, but not really Def Leppard, in the not really Def Leppard story.  And the guy with the missing arm, but he's not really missing an arm.  How did they do that?  We'll show you on behind the Def Leppard movie, behind the music.  See how they struggled on to perform songs like Love Bite.  Love Bite! 
[00:55:00]  When you need that!  Put some sugar on me and rock it, yeah!  Watch how they were gang-raped by five black rappers after a concert one day.  It still survived a arm.  Make your own British flag shorts.  Just like the drummer.  The movie, Hysteria.  Def Leppard.  Starring people that kind of look like Def Leppard.  I'm there.  I'm there.  That says watch me. 
[00:55:30]  How cheesy was the blonde guy?  Remember the blonde guy?  They all were blonde, no?  Tight pants.  No, no, no.  The short blonde hair guy.  Hey, and then the guy died.  Wait a minute.  The one long hair guy died.  Did he shoot himself or something?  No, he got like so effed up all the time on booze and drugs.  Oh, that's got to be a great part of the movie, too.  Oh, bandmate's dead, but the band's got to go on.  We're missing a leg in a play, but we're confusing love bites.  Oh, me gone, me foot fell off.  But we could still be a band. 
[00:56:00]  See Def Leppard.  As they transform into a band of nothing but heads.  Heads.  Singing heads.  My body rotted off, but we're still a band.  We've got to keep Def Leppard together.  Singing heads.  They're bringing their heads out.  Shut up.  They're bringing them out.  Look, it's the heads.  They're putting them on the stool, man.  A story of courage and bravery.  As Def Leppard is just heads.  I had to learn how to play the guitar all over again when I was just a head. 
[00:56:30]  It's hard to re- I had to re-teach myself guitar.  Of course, I had to play with me tongue.  With special gifts, as he comes in and grabs one head and bites it in half.  And then shoves the other half in his pooper.  Well, it's quite amazing.  I love how to study you to just a head.  I feel we were snorting some lines.  It's just a head that cocaine came right out the neck. 
[00:57:00]  I think I'm basically saying it's this myself.  See the story of courage.  Bravery.  A story no one gives a flying F about.  Def Leppard.  In Torso Rock.  See, they're choking on their own vomit stories. 
[00:57:30]  Def Leppard hysteria.  I don't know what they're saying either.  It was great.  We're all still buds from long ago.  And no matter how many body parts fall off, we got to keep the band together.  We were abused.  I remember one time we went out with Metallica and they used our heads for kickballs.  It was not funny. 
[00:58:00]  Lars got real drunk and he ordained it on my wife.  I remember one time the bass player, you know, he's still just a head, decided to take a drive.  And he got in a horrible accident and lost his ears.  And since he played the bass with his ears on his head, he had to teach himself all over how to play without the ears.  Hysteria.  See how one of them finally went into a movie career and entered the movie Castaway. 
[00:58:30]  The Roadshow, the stage production, London of Castaway.  What was the guy's name, Castaway?  The part of Wilson.  Wilson.  Wilson!  I used to be named Wilson.  Wilson!  Hey, Matt, what's up?  Yes, I got a real good feeling that they're going to have to change the name of that movie to Hysterical.  Yeah.  Hysterical.  They're going to have a big, big herb tomorrow, do some bong hits. 
[00:59:00]  It's going to be funny.  Right on.  They got the bad wig jobs and stuff.  Yeah, the bad 80s British rock guy wigs. </pre>
