<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of NFL games, specifically criticizing a Cowboys coach's timeout and mocking Tim Tebow's post-game prayer.  This transitioned into a graphic and highly critical analysis of the reality show "The Virgin Diaries," focusing on the participants' sexual inexperience and perceived homosexuality.  The hosts then debated Neil Patrick Harris' apology for using the word "tranny," vehemently disagreeing with GLAAD's condemnation.  A caller then provided a scientific explanation and live audio demonstration of the difference in vocal pitch caused by inhaling helium versus sulfur hexafluoride.  The show continued with discussions of Tiger Woods' win, the Mets' financial troubles, and an Occupy Wall Street protester's surprising career shift.  The segment concluded with audio from "The Silence of the Lambs."

The next segment opened with a humorous bit about technical difficulties. Uncle Nino, Vinny's uncle from MTV's *Jersey Shore*, then called in to promote his Broadway show, "Bad Jokes and Wine," delivering a series of extremely offensive jokes.  The hosts then discussed the death of Patrice O'Neal, praising E-Rock's tribute special and sharing their opinions on funerals and open caskets.  The conversation shifted to Herman Cain's presidential withdrawal amidst sexual harassment allegations, followed by crude commentary on various presidential candidates.  A lengthy discussion ensued detailing sexually explicit material, particularly interracial cuckold pornography.  The hosts also discussed Jerry Sandusky and O.J. Simpson.  Joe DeRosa joined in studio to promote his show at Caroline's Comedy Club, and the hosts discussed Minneapolis, the Mall of America, and Hulk Hogan's failed restaurant, "Pasta Mania," punctuated by sexually suggestive banter.  Chris Rock and John Jones were mentioned as scheduled guests.

The following segment focused on Hulk Hogan's divorce, with comedian guests Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa expressing negative opinions about Hogan and his divorce settlement, particularly Linda Hogan's substantial share of the assets.  The discussion included perspectives on women's reactions to comedy about aging and divorce.  UFC champion Jon Jones then joined the show, discussing his recent fight, training, and the differences between UFC and Pride fighting. He shared anecdotes about fan interactions and intervening in fights.  He also discussed his upcoming fight with Lyoto Machida and his past relationship with Rashad Evans.

A subsequent segment featured Jon Jones demonstrating a leg kick on Jim Norton, resulting in significant pain and near-vomiting for Norton.  The hosts and guests (including Burr and DeRosa) reacted with laughter.  This was followed by discussion of Jones's upcoming fight and weight management.  The segment included listener "fuck you" calls, further discussion of Norton's injury, and a tribute to Patrice O'Neal, with a phone call from Chris Rock sharing anecdotes and reflections.  A posthumous album by O'Neal, *Mr. P*, was promoted.

Another segment focused extensively on anecdotes about Patrice O'Neal, including a disastrous benefit show where he discussed eating a puppy, clashes with The Comedy Cellar owner, and his interactions with other comedians.  Stories included a bus trip to Yankee Stadium and a brutal roasting session of Eddie Ifft, featuring Jim Norton, Bobby Kelly, and Keith Robinson.  The hosts expressed concerns about Bobby Kelly's health, and Chris Rock's intervention with Patrice was mentioned. The segment included a digression about football and speculation on Anthony Cumia's potential death, followed by a call from Chris Rock. An Amsterdam trip with Keith Robinson was recounted.

The final segment heavily featured discussions of Jim Norton's physique and Patrice O'Neal's death.  Guests Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa were present.  The hosts and guests engaged in crude banter about Norton, and ridiculed insensitive tweets and media coverage of O'Neal's death, specifically MTV's handling and Piers Morgan's mistake about O'Neal's gender.  They promoted Burr and DeRosa's shows, a .XXX domain service, and ProFlowers Christmas trees.  A five-hour Patrice O'Neal special was announced, and a post-show summary by Sam Roberts highlighted the guests and the tribute.  A video of Opie kicking Jim Norton was also mentioned.

[00:03:30]  Thank you.  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning. 
[00:04:30]  Hi there, peoples.  Peoples out there.  Hello.  Rail and.  Hello.  Monday morning.  Monday morning.  Monday.  Good morning.  Good morning.  We were just discussing football.  Oh, yeah.  All our teams play.  What's your team again?  I don't have one.  I know what happened in football from my drive-in.  That's about it.  Yeah, you get caught up.  There were some good games, though. 
[00:05:00]  Jimmy's Cowboys fucked it up.  I heard that the timeout.  I didn't watch the game.  Good.  Yeah.  I only saw the highlights, so I don't know why they were going for the timeout.  And asked, because we were watching the highlights before the show.  Yeah, that one seemed really stupid.  I assume the coach there saw something on the field he didn't like,  so he wanted to call a timeout to maybe do a little adjustment.  But he called the timeout in time, but the play already started. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And what's his name?  Kicked the fucking field goal to win the game.  But no, because of the timeout, they had to do it again.  And then he fucking missed the fucking field goal.  Then he missed.  He froze his own kicker, basically, is what a lot of people are saying today.  That's a pretty dumb thing to do.  Yeah.  Well, why'd they give the timeout if the play had already started?  Well, no.  I mean, it's a timing thing.  Officially, he got the timeout in time.  But the guys on the field didn't know.  Snapped the ball. 
[00:06:00]  It was like that split-second thing.  Oh, how awful.  Yeah.  That's not good.  That was not good for your Cowboys there.  Well, at least the Giants lost.  At least the Redskins lost.  And the Eagles are not still lost.  So Cowboys still in first, right?  Are my Cowboys still in first?  Oh, shit.  You're not a Jets fan.  I am.  My Jets beat the Redskins.  Yeah, the Giants game.  That's a heartbreaker for Giants fans.  I am no Giants fan.  Yeah, they lost that one at the end of the game, I guess.  Yeah, that was a field goal, too.  And goal-packed goal. 
[00:06:30]  Still undefeated.  Undefeated Green Bay, huh?  I couldn't watch my Jets because I was in Philly this weekend.  Yeah.  And they blacked out the game.  I'm like, come on, man.  I'm close enough.  Isn't Philly in between Washington and New York?  Do I have to look on a map?  So why wouldn't Philly have the game?  The Eagles weren't playing.  They weren't playing?  They went with the Steelers, I guess.  So I get it, I guess.  But, I mean, come on.  Why did they black it out when I showed both? 
[00:07:00]  The Jets are, like, just north and Washington is south.  Give me the fucking Jets-Redskins game.  Where were you that didn't have a...  I was down in Philly this weekend.  You were closer to New York than you were to Pittsburgh.  Yeah, you were closer to D.C. than you were to Pittsburgh.  I know.  That's what I'm trying to get at here.  So I had to watch, you know...  No Red Zone?  Well, they had the Red Zone downstairs, and I was upstairs with the kid.  Oh, Jesus.  So you could have seen.  And I got all excited. 
[00:07:30]  I popped on the Red Zone on the upstairs TV, and they don't have it upstairs, and I was  too lazy to go downstairs.  Oh, okay.  Now it's making more sense.  I was lazy.  Okay.  I just wanted to kind of chill upstairs with my kid.  And so I had to watch God's chosen son, Tim Tebow.  Well, he's thanking Jesus.  You know, at this point, I...  For this game yesterday.  I want to like the guy, but you saw it, too.  They're like, hey, Tim, what do you think of the big win today?  And he's like, first, first, first, let's all slow down first. 
[00:08:00]  First of all, let me thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  Right, shut up.  It's like the first thing.  Jesus is going to be mad if he just goes, you know, hey, let me thank, you know, my coach.  A lot of people are trying to figure out why he's hated.  That is why he's hated.  It's not that he likes the God thing.  It's how he comes across, and everything has to be God first.  First, first, first, let's do this, and then I'll talk about the game.  Well, he'll have a seat at the right hand of God while we're all burning in hell. 
[00:08:30]  So there, he wins again.  Enjoy.  He's 6-1 as a starter, though.  Although he was supposed to beat the Vikings.  The Vikings are not a good team this year.  Where was Jesus that one game?  That one game?  He didn't win.  I think that was the first game he came in, right?  I think.  Oh, and Jesus didn't know he was playing?  No, Jesus was busy with a tsunami or something and said, wait, what?  It's like, wait, Tim Tebow's playing?  Fuck.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I believe that's what happened.  Did he thank Jesus that game?  Because he probably shouldn't have thanked him. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, I'm sure he did.  For what?  The loss?  I'm sure he thanked him for putting him in.  I don't know.  Yes.  But he's starting to turn into a pretty decent-looking quarterback.  He actually threw this time, too, Ant.  Yeah.  He had over 200 yards passing.  That's impressive in the NFL.  Wow.  Can we hear him talk?  Is it possible to hear him talk?  Yes.  I enjoy hearing him talk.  The Lord loves me.  Oh, the Bible damned me.  I'll tell you.  Not everything's for the air, but when he talked today, Ant had a few choice words. 
[00:09:30]  Well, I was saying he sounds a bit effeminate.  Yeah, he does.  I think.  You know how much pussy this guy would be getting if he wasn't into the Jesus?  Jesus.  He could get that Jesus.  Is he?  When he finally, like, kisses something, is it going to be like the Virgin Diaries?  Oh, God.  I hope for his sake he's at least kissed girls on the mouth.  On the mouth.  Not like that fucking, not like that guy that really should figure out that he's gay. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Guy from Virgin Diaries last night.  Yeah.  Do we have longer clips of that kiss?  Yeah, they show, like, them kissing during the, like, reception now and everything, and  it's just, he does just, just ding with his mouth.  It's almost like Edgar, but it's a little point, it's a little pointier, like a turtle  mouth.  Oh, God.  And then he just starts sucking and biting on our face.  Oh, God.  It's terrible.  And then the other Virgin guy that was on it, I mean, I assume he's gay.  And then the three Virgin chicks that were roommates, I assume they're all lesbian. 
[00:10:30]  They just, especially the guys on that show, they just seem like gay guys that don't know  they're gay yet.  And the guy who got married made the mistake, you could hear when he was talking, he was  like, after we kissed, she just, she wanted to kiss more and more, and I'm like, slow  down.  Yeah, yeah.  This is weird.  What?  What's weird about that?  When they, when that fucking guy says, you know, I now pronounce you man and wife, you  may kiss to Brian, he goes, Oh, you really?  Right.  And, and then she's, she's miked. 
[00:11:00]  And all you're hearing is, I swear you hear her panting.  We need clips of this show.  Where's the clips of the show?  They lift up her veil.  Yeah.  She starts fucking making out and her hands, you could see on the bottom part of the screen,  her hands are flapping.  Oh my God.  She's flapping her arms.  Like she's coming as they're kissing.  We could all relate to that, but it happened when we were what?  Well, 12, 13.  I wish I was a late bloomer.  Unfortunately, but 14 or 15 for me, to be honest with you. 
[00:11:30]  That's fine.  At least it's a, you know, fucking 30.  And you know what?  You just let it flow, man.  You don't, you don't tell anyone to slow down.  You're making out, you're making comsies, you're making comsies.  The best was the end of the show.  Yeah.  When they finally talked to them after their wedding night.  Right.  They talked to them after the sex.  Oh boy.  And his description of what happened and, and hers too.  They're both like kind of sitting with kind of little disappointed looks on their face.  And they're like, ah, well, it's not like in the movies, you know, their thing. 
[00:12:00]  Everyone knows what to do.  And it's just not, you know, and she's like, it hurt.  It really hurt.  That means he's packing.  He had a big dick.  He's got a big dick.  Or he was just a lousy fuck.  Just like fucking.  I think that's more big dick than lousy fuck.  Big cock.  He's got a, he's got a hog.  You think?  He didn't look like the type that would have a big dick.  That's the beauty of it.  What a discovery.  It was probably very turgid for having not been, you know, used. 
[00:12:30]  So he probably was like a fucking piece of granite.  I think it was just pulsating.  Just smacking it.  Yeah, he felt, she felt his pulse inside her vagina the whole time.  I want clips from this show, Sam.  Yeah, we need the end.  What happened?  I think the end clip where they talk about the sex.  That's great.  And then the other guy, the dumb fat idiot.  The nerd?  That says he's a virgin.  The nerdy guy, right?  And he's like, not by choice.  Not by choice.  A mother's coming by tonight and we're going to discuss my date. 
[00:13:00]  I'm going to cook her lasagna and I love making fudge.  And it's like, he set up dinner with his mother.  It looked like a fucking date.  He had two bottles, glasses of wine on the table.  And it's like, this guy is just, he's gay.  He doesn't want to admit it to himself for some reason.  You think the fudge thing is a tell?  He's making fudge in his little bachelor kitchen.  He's got cats.  He just, it's, everything pointed to, my gaydar detector was beeping like crazy. 
[00:13:30]  Cats are rough, right?  Cats.  Single guy with cats?  Yeah.  You go dog over cat.  That's rough.  Sorry.  Sorry.  But, uh, and then he goes to a bar.  First he goes on a date and tells this fatty that he's a virgin on the date.  And she doesn't even want to fuck him.  And, uh, then he goes out with his friends and it's just some gin mill shithole bar and  some dikey spiky hair hag, uh, who's older than he is comes, comes up and starts like 
[00:14:00]  grinding her ass on his crotch and licking his shaved head.  And like, really she's drunk.  And all of his friends are like, yeah, she wants to do this.  You know, go ahead.  And then they come back at the end of the show and talk to him and goes, yeah, I could have.  I know I did.  But you know, sometimes you're just not attracted to somebody.  It's like at that point, just shoot your load in a vagina and get over the fact that  you're a virgin and that's now totally engulfing your entire life. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  Like the whole virgin thing.  And those three bitches, actually two girls were virgins.  One was a reclaimed virgin.  Stop that shit.  What is that?  Oh, does that mean she was molested?  It's like trying to reclaim Kennedy's brains after the fucking shot.  It ain't going to happen.  Well, what's a reclaimed virgin?  She had sex with like six guys and then she decided she wanted to be a virgin again.  So, uh, I don't know.  What did she go?  Mecca, like a high mecca, high me, high me, high me ho?  What did she go to the doctor and get a couple of stitches?  Yeah, a couple of stitches.  Let's tighten that up again. 
[00:15:00]  And then she's fucking, uh.  I'm reclaiming my virginity.  She's, you know, sitting with these other two who are legit virgins.  You got CokeLogic on your bad side, by the way, because he has cats.  He wants to know what the hell is gay about cats.  He's not happy with you, sir.  All right, CokeLogic, you fruit.  Exactly.  Well, if you're allowed to have dogs and you go cats, eh.  But if you're an animal lover and you decide cat over dog.  No, he's a shut-in.  He's a shut-in.  So he likes the cats and he doesn't have to leave the house.  A cat with a single guy doesn't mean gay, but it's part of a puzzle that if you have 
[00:15:30]  your mom over to discuss that you're a virgin and discuss your fucking date that you're going  out on, your first date in eight months, and then you cook for your mommy and put out little  glasses of wine for her, and you make fudge, and you're a virgin at 30 years old, and then  you have cats.  But it's a good point.  I mean, you could be a shut-in.  Yeah.  Someone like CokeLogic isn't going to leave his house to walk a dog, but at least a cat  can shit wherever the fuck he wants.  Yeah.  You're safe, CokeLogic.  Cha.  We give you a pass. 
[00:16:00]  But it was like that guy just didn't understand.  And he didn't want to have sex with a crazy girl at the bar.  Right.  At the end, he said, no, I'm not attracted.  It's like, no, just do it.  It's like, oh, people have said I should get a prostitute.  I don't want my first time to be like that.  It's like, stop with putting this big thing on the first fucking time.  Especially at 30.  Maybe if you're 15 years old, you're really concentrating on how special that first time  is going to be if you're a chick.  I think, what do you think?  Most, the average guy around 13, 14 until you lose your virginity is a big deal. 
[00:16:30]  And then you get it out of the way.  I made it nice for girls.  A little candlelight by my fucking pull-out bed.  I'm sure you did.  And a little Marshall Tucker playing.  Can't you see?  Come to Kansas City.  That's it.  You made it all nice for the lady.  And then I suggested to one of the girls that, you know, because I went down on her.  And then I suggested to her that maybe she go down on me.  And she was, she's like, I just don't know how.  I've never done it.  I'm like, that matters. 
[00:17:00]  She goes, my friend told me to practice on a banana.  Oh, that old gag.  Like, all right, whatever you want to do.  Best times it was.  I think I got one inside.  Best times it was a carrot, right?  Yeah.  You got to go carrot.  Go carrot.  How much comes out when a guy comes?  About a quarter or so.  Good word.  Did she suck it?  She was horrified.  Not that night.  But she did later on.  Did she get the candy?  She was a fine trooper.  Nah, you know what?  Never got the candy.  She didn't get the candy?  Back in those days, girls weren't so sexually promiscuous with their mouths and assholes. 
[00:17:30]  It was very tough to get a girl to fucking suck until you came in her mouth.  It really was.  They'd fucking wah, wah, wah.  But then you got to, you know, just have some regular sex to bully a load.  Where were we?  Tim Tebow?  Oh, shit.  And I want this Virgin Diary audio, man.  I want to hear some of this shit.  Yeah, you got to get that.  I didn't realize it was on last night.  I was too busy watching football.  Anthony's really good at painting pictures.  Like, I'm so bad at that.  You're great at that, man.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That's fucking difficult. 
[00:18:00]  It's all in my mind.  I would have talked for 30 seconds about that.  I really would have.  I'm doing this for a long time.  I would have said, dude, the fucking Chicks are virgins.  Get a paintbrush.  Start painting.  I'm very bad at that, dude.  Here's Tim Tebow after the game.  I kind of want to like this guy, but Jesus.  Enough with the Lord and Savior.  See how bad you want it.  And so, you know, I think I'm just proud of our guys because, you know, the way we came  out there in the second half, you could see that there was a different team that got on  that field.  Tim, was the plan to go with that bike in second year a little bit more today? 
[00:18:30]  They're going to please a little bit.  Where are the people going to town?  I think, you know, the main thing was we just wanted to be balanced and try to keep them  off balance as much as we could.  And, I think, Coach McCoy did a great job of keeping them off balance.  And we hit some big plays there in the second half.  That ass is really telling.  D.K. stepped up and made so many huge plays.  And, you know, that only comes because, you know, their eyeing back a little bit more.  And so, you know, but that's what it's all about, you know, on our team is helping the  guy next to you.  And, you know, one game or another, you're going to get your opportunity. 
[00:19:00]  And today was, you know, D.T.'s opportunity.  And he stepped up.  And I'm so proud of him, you know, because he's such a great guy.  And he works so hard.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He seems like a nice guy.  Yeah.  I bet everybody on the team doesn't say it.  Do you think Tim sounds, yeah, he played a good game.  Yeah, good game.  Good game.  Sounds like a great quarterback.  He sure does.  He sure does.  Sounds like, you know, they're doing you, Benny does.  Nobody wants to acknowledge it.  No.  No.  They talk to him.  He sounds like this. 
[00:19:30]  The S's.  And the guys always let me have the shower to myself, which is just so nice.  I walk in and they clear out like roaches.  The light's gone.  Oh, man.  He's getting a little more respect around the league now.  A little bit.  A little bit more.  Six and one is a starter.  Fucking the Broncos were dead in the water.  Now they're in first place.  With Jesus's help.  Because the Raiders got their ass kicked.  Raiders lost to Miami, right?  Did they?  34 to 14.  Fuck.  The Raiders. 
[00:20:00]  I can't wait till he loses in the playoffs.  Who?  Tim.  They weren't even supposed to make the playoffs.  Then we'll see what he says about God.  Oh, yeah.  If they even make the playoffs and it's looking pretty good right now, that's a major accomplishment  for the Broncos.  They were 1-4 to start the year.  I just want to see if he thanks God.  Another 7-5.  Humiliating loss.  Humiliating?  If he loses the playoffs, he'll get a real bad one.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They're becoming fun to watch, the Broncos. 
[00:20:30]  Fuck.  I watched them instead of the Jets.  Yeah.  Why isn't Patty on this show?  I agree.  Oh, the virgin show.  Oh, the virgin show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Frank, you're right.  I don't know.  Are they doing more than one?  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be like a...  But do you have to lose your virginity by the end of the show?  No.  That's just it.  Holy shit.  Patty should be on that thing.  The fat guy and the three bitches.  The three girls went out on a blind date with three guys.  Yeah.  They showed them getting ready and talking about, oh, my special man's going to be this and 
[00:21:00]  that.  Then they went out on this date with three guys and they're sitting across from each  other in the booth talking.  And then the one girl goes, you know, I'm a virgin.  And then the one, so am I.  And so am I.  Well, I'm a reclaimed...  All right, shut up.  Enough of that.  And then they go, well, what do you think about that?  One of the guys starts talking.  He's like, I think it's great that, you know, you want that special somebody because, by  the way, I'm a virgin, too.  And the guys go, I am, too.  I am, too.  And then I'm just looking at them like, gay.  And how old are they?  And they were like in their 30s, like late 20s, 30s. 
[00:21:30]  That's a problem, man.  Yeah.  All you want to do is spill your semen by the time you hit puberty, right?  Yeah.  Then they talk about, oh, they talked about going.  They went to a secluded little cabin where they were joking about how perhaps some of  the couches, they could all sleep, you know, on couches in the cabin and have a good time.  And they didn't get home until three in the morning.  And then they're like, and the big question is, are we still virgins?  And then they look around and go, yes.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  And then all I could think of is, yes, technically.  What about your mouth and your ass?  What about that?  You'd be a wonderful host for that show, especially if you had it right in their face with a bullhorn.  Yeah.  What about your mouth and your assholes?  Are those still virginal?  And Patty would be a star in this show.  Oh, yeah.  People would be out of their minds for her.  She's too old now, though.  Send her out on a date.  No, they're just looking for virgins.  They don't give a shit.  Dude, they would sign her up in a minute.  A fucking, how old is she now?  50-year-old virgin?  50-year-old virgin?  55?  Something like that. 
[00:22:30]  That's just sad now.  But she is crazy.  She's very TV.  Oh, they'd love her.  They would love her.  Somebody would write in.  I'm just waiting for a special guard.  You have a dumb face.  Well, I'm very afraid of disease.  People would be like, oh, my God.  Dude, you've got to fucking see this.  I DVR'd it.  Yeah, she would be perfect.  How do we get her on the show?  At the end of the show, they said if you know a virgin.  I'm not here.  So let's get all our listeners to push Patty's name forward.  Check it out.  She'd be perfect.  Go to, what is it, on TLC? 
[00:23:00]  On TLC.  Yeah, go to TLC's website.  I'm sure if you go to the show there, they'll have a little place where you can email them.  We have a clip we can play?  We'll probably get one.  What do you got?  That's the 30-year-old virgin.  Yeah, he was on CNN.  Right now, the only things online are those preview clips that we already saw.  Oh.  Oh, man.  I want to see.  Yeah, the end.  When the couple talks about having sex with each other, it's so telling that that marriage is doomed.  She's a horny fucking disaster.  And he's just, I don't think he really likes sex. 
[00:23:30]  And I don't think it's that big a deal to him or he would have lost his virginity a long time ago.  But this chick, I swear she was panting.  It's great.  Plus, when she was kissing, it was like she was sucking his mouth, like she was attacking him.  Oh, yeah, she wanted to, like.  Yeah, her kiss was bad, too.  Oh, terrible.  They were both terrible.  Hers could have been worse.  The whole time.  Yeah, she stuck her tongue out at one point and licked his face.  And she, and he kissed her tongue as it was sticking out of her face. 
[00:24:00]  It was just odd.  You know she had still breath when she was licking his face.  Oh, it didn't matter at that point.  Were you watching it as the show went on with those two?  They kept going in to kiss each other, but they'd end up pretending they met on the cheek  because they were just not in sync at all.  Yeah, they didn't know how to, like, they were allowed to kiss now in their minds because  they had been married, but they had been kissing on the cheek for so long that they would go  in.  It was an odd thing.  They would go in like they were going to kiss on the mouth.  And then he'd go around the side and kiss a pecker on the cheek. 
[00:24:30]  And that's how they kissed for years that they were engaged.  Why don't we have clips of this show?  It's not online.  It's not online yet.  Yeah.  Maybe her breath stunk or you want to kiss her.  Huh?  Maybe her breath stunk.  She probably had, like, fucking nervous breath, like sour nervous breath.  Yeah.  With little white, you know that white milky stuff that you collect in the corner?  Schmegma.  Dry schmegma.  Yeah, in the corner of your lips.  People are saying Bobo, too, for the show.  Oh, God.  For the show.  I'm a virgin.  Look, look, by the way.  Oh, my.  He would be impossible. 
[00:25:00]  He would have a rod the whole time.  Yeah, we're going to.  He was cumming in his pants.  We're going to blow with TLC.  Let's focus on Patty, people.  Yeah, because Bobo seemed like an idiot.  Yeah, we're going to blow it with the Bobo thing.  Let's get Patty on the show, and then we can move on to Bobo.  All right?  Let's do this.  Is there a tranny in the Pal Talk room jerking off?  Well, I'll let you know it.  Let's see.  What is this?  Miss Bowles?  Miss Bowles.  Look at this.  That's a horrible name.  There's a.  You know.  What the hell's going on with this room?  Speaking of trannies.  We can move on to our next subject here. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, good.  Neil Patrick Harris had to fucking apologize for saying tranny.  What?  On live with whatever the fuck the name of the show is now.  But he's gay.  Is that like saying fag to them?  Like to transsexuals?  Do they see it like that?  Tranny is not good anymore?  They don't like it.  Neil Patrick Harris, who is openly gay, was filling in for Regis.  They're doing like, you know, a bunch of people until they figure out who's going to take over for Regis.  He, I don't know.  He turned that Regis stool upside down and invited three friends. 
[00:26:00]  I love that old gag.  Funny every time.  I know.  He was making a joke and then he, what, what, you got that, Sam?  Yeah.  And he had to apologize for saying tranny now.  He quoted put the lotion in the basket on the show in his Buffalo Bill voice.  Right.  And then he said, I've never sounded more like a tranny in my life.  So what's.  I guess they were doing like a Darth Vader thing.  What was he supposed to say?  But isn't that how a tranny would sound?  So what's the problem?  But he's using them as the reference in the punchline. 
[00:26:30]  No matter how you said that, that might not be acceptable.  I've never sounded more like a transgendered person.  Yeah, exactly.  Transgendered.  Well, that would be a problem, too, because, again, he's using us as the reference in the punchline.  It's like, hey, they don't all sound like that.  Yes, they do.  They were inhaling anti-helium gas, which makes your voice deeper.  What's anti-helium gas?  Why haven't we done that yet?  Helium makes your voice high.  Nitrogen?  Yeah.  Whatever it was.  But there's something that makes it deep?  It would have to be a heavier gas than the air we breathe. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  Like helium's lighter, so it makes you sound high-pitched.  Like a heavier gas?  Like what?  Like fucking.  It's crazy that you just know that.  I don't even know how to weigh gases.  Who the fuck knows why helium, why does helium do that?  Eh, because you eat it and it makes your voice noisy.  Yeah, just kind of.  You know that.  I don't know.  I just pick things up.  I don't know how that happens.  But yeah, so Ripa did the Darth Vader impression while they had, and then Neil Patrick Harris 
[00:27:30]  did the Buffalo Bill impression.  Oh, okay.  And then he said, I've never sounded more like a tranny in my life.  And isn't Buffalo Bill kind of a tranny type of individual?  Yes, absolutely.  He's a movie in the movie, right?  It's hot.  So what's the problem?  Who the fuck had a problem with this?  The gay and lesbian alliance against defamation, of course, Opie.  You know them as GLAAD.  And GLAAD did call it a slur.  Get the fuck out of here, GLAAD.  You can't make up slurs.  You can't start making up your own slurs and calling things slurs.  Well, until people stop apologizing. 
[00:28:00]  Like he should have said.  And you're talking about a guy that's sensitive to that whole thing, and he felt like it was  okay to do.  You gotta relax, GLAAD.  You gotta fucking relax.  He wrote, truly sorry for saying the word tranny on live this week.  Twice.  Should have been more thoughtful.  Didn't mean to offend.  No, he was being thoughtful.  He thought that's perfectly fine.  His apology is the fact that he puts a penis in his ass.  Yeah.  That's good enough.  Right there.  That's unbelievable.  That should give him immunity. 
[00:28:30]  That's like an immunity idol in your ass.  Now you can't say tranny?  How do people even do TV at this point?  Dude, I have no idea.  It's impossible.  You can't make a joke and reference a tranny?  It's impossible.  We're supposed to understand trannies now?  Yeah.  How are we supposed to understand trannies?  Explain that to me.  First of all, it's a little weird to me still.  You're not saying tranny, sir.  Fuck that.  It's really strange.  I would never apologize for a tranny slur.  I would expect them all to come out and defend me as well.  No one has helped our community financially more than this joke. 
[00:29:00]  Holy fuck.  You're dressed like a woman.  You've got a deep voice and we're not supposed to acknowledge that might still be weird for  a lot of people.  You just can't call them tranny.  Yeah.  That's a slur.  Why is it?  I don't know why either.  Why is that?  Yeah.  Why is it?  Gladstaven just said, it's heartening to see a celebrity of Harris's stature recognize  and apologize for using the slur in such a timely manner.  Oh, it's heartening as opposed to disheartening when they got it. 
[00:29:30]  I never heard heartening used.  Heartening.  Heartening.  Heartening.  It's disheartening and heartening.  I've never heard that.  Me neither.  Please.  Give me a break.  Neil Patrick Harris should not have had to apologize.  Tranny is a word.  Sure is.  Deal with it.  It is.  It's just a word.  It's a T word.  Well, it's a transgendered mission is what you have in your car.  That's why.  Yes.  I'm going to be left with any words we're allowed to utter.  Not especially when it comes to comedy. 
[00:30:00]  Not when it describes somebody in any way, shape or form.  That is not some technical term that those people made up themselves, no matter what group  it is.  That seems to be the criteria here.  What about just regular heterosexual, white, male, you know, why don't we come up with  some slurs?  What?  Employed American.  I hate that.  When entertain or maybe it must have been from Glad Statement because it was a quote.  Tranny, the A is asterisked out. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, man.  What?  Look.  Let me see.  Look, they didn't even print it on the site.  The way you asterisk, asterisk, F.  Like, yeah.  Blank K.  Just giving the word power, you idiots.  It's amazing how, what, what fucking.  You're just giving the word power.  Oh, true.  Baby-ish.  You're putting the word in a spotlight, you dopes.  Tranny is one of the most hurtful and dehumanizing slurs that transgender people must hear.  Most transgender people associate that word with personal experiences of violence, hatred, 
[00:31:00]  and derision.  I don't believe that.  No, I don't either.  I don't believe that tranny is, I believe you, if someone's going to punch a transsexual  in the face, they're going to call him a faggot.  Right.  Or a bitch.  They're not going to call him a tranny.  Let's beat up that tranny.  It doesn't even be right.  I don't believe that.  It doesn't sound right.  And we've all avoided that our entire lives, because you don't want to be beat up by someone  that's wearing high heels and has a dick.  Fuck.  They're crazy.  Never would I fucking fight a transsexual.  No way.  I'm being a tranny.  That would be embarrassing.  It's a lose-lose situation. 
[00:31:30]  That's the Kobayashi Maru of fights.  I'm getting beat up, and I have an erection.  They slash you with box cutters, man.  You can't fuck with them.  And then if you do beat up a tranny, you just...  Trannies...  It's like, oh, what'd you do?  You beat up a fucking tranny.  I would assume trannies in general don't need GLAAD's help.  They take care of their own...  Yeah.  Do we have the actual clip of Neil Patrick Harris?  Yeah.  Fast forward to the end of it.  Let's hear how outrageous this was.  5,000 volts of static electricity.  Good times. 
[00:32:00]  This would be a...  I've got to find the bullet.  Oh, it's Mr. Science coming in.  Oh, here we go.  Here he goes.  Let me go back to some of the kind of gas to this.  That's what you want to know.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, we want to learn today, so...  Times lighter than air.  Is he on helium, this guy?  Go back.  A little more.  So who's on helium right there?  Someone's already on...  That's Science Bob.  And he's already on helium?  He's not.  That's his voice.  That's his regular voice.  Okay, here we go.  Helium tank?  Not quite.  In fact, this is...  Well, you know how helium will make your voice go higher?  I'm sure we've all talked about. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, my kids are always sucking on a balloon, and they've talked to me.  Well, this is kind of helium's evil twin.  Oh.  So helium is six times lighter than air, and so sound passes through it differently, and  so it makes the high parts of your voice kind of depressed.  We're okay with that, right?  It's six times heavier than air, and thus, it has the opposite of the things to do here.  I'm going to have to fill up a couple balloons here with this.  Probably because it's toxic.  It's going to make us gain weight.  Absolutely not.  What's this?  Really? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, they don't want the kids doing it.  Every lady wants to know...  Look, the balloon goes down.  It's heavy.  What we do is make you a little host chat, maybe, but a sulfur hexafluoride version of  this.  Sulfur hexafluoride.  Yeah.  And what is the symbol for that on the chart?  That was...  She's in trouble with outrageous.  Sulfur hexafluoride?  Yeah.  That sounds dangerous.  All right.  So here's what we're going to do with this.  I love this.  This is good stuff.  This is dangerous?  Okay.  Here we go. 
[00:33:30]  Fine.  Fine.  All right.  So wait.  Breathe out.  There we go.  And you're going to get the whole thing.  Whippets.  Breathe it in.  There you go.  Whole thing.  Whole thing.  All right.  There they go.  And a little host chat.  Wow.  That's weird.  Whoa.  Luke, I am your father.  You don't want to mess with me.  You are absolutely punished.  Make it to your room.  You're the sick.  Put the lotion in the basket. 
[00:34:00]  Put the lotion in the basket.  That's kind of funny.  Okay.  Okay.  We need more.  We need more.  Stop.  We need more.  Give me the day.  Urgent.  We are.  By the way, when you're breathing that, you're not getting air.  I sound like Kristen Johnson.  I've never sounded more like a franny in my life.  Okay.  Let's just more.  We got more.  How was this?  All right.  We're fast.  That sucks.  That sucks.  I've never sounded more like a franny.  I don't go for that. 
[00:34:30]  What?  No, that's horseplay.  That's kind of rude.  I like that type of horseplay.  The T word is right.  They should block out that.  It's very offensive.  Those people got to fucking relax, man.  And, you know, good point from Jimmy Newpalt.  It's funny that Glad accepted his apology and didn't make him do a tour.  That's a great point.  I guess because it was timely or they were heartened.  They were heartened by it.  Heartened.  And the fact that, like, they're not going to take one of their own and really make him,  you know, jump through the hoops, as they say.  The old hair hoop.  See?  That's an asshole.  Oh, I never heard that. 
[00:35:00]  Hair hoop.  Hair hoop.  Hair hoop.  Jesus.  Jump through the hair hoop.  The old stinky scrunchie.  What the fuck, dude?  Let's go to Anthony in Jersey.  He's going to explain the gas thing for you.  Ah.  Hit it.  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning.  Let's go.  Hi, Anthony.  Welcome.  Hey.  All right.  So what you basically have is you've got sulfur hexafluoride and you've got bonds as opposed  to helium where they're a lot more spaced apart. 
[00:35:30]  So when you inhale helium, all the bonds are really tight.  They're really packed.  There's a lot more bonds inside there.  So when you're talking, you're vibrating the air molecules.  So for you to actually speak when you have helium, they're vibrating a lot faster because you're  vibrating the air that's bouncing back and forth.  Ah, on the molecular level.  Yeah.  So then when you breathe in sulfur hexafluoride, the bonds are so far spaced apart, it takes  your voice longer to bounce back and forth between those molecules. 
[00:36:00]  And make them vibrate.  Oh, now that makes perfect sense.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, shit.  That's it.  All right, you geek.  You guys know what he's talking about.  He's guessing.  All right.  That's pretty good.  So.  Yeah, that's ludicrous.  Stop it.  By the way, we did a little sports.  Tiger Woods won for the first time in two years.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It wasn't a sanctioned tournament by the PGA.  What, was it just fucking playing alone in his backyard? 
[00:36:30]  He beat some good players, but not the whole gang was playing.  But regardless, did he do well?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, no, no.  He had a good tournament.  Maybe he just needs a win in his belt now.  Yeah.  Under his belt.  Under his belt.  Yeah, the season's pretty much over, so, you know.  As opposed to a Perkins waitress under his belt.  Exactly.  He's got a few million more now.  That dumb you could tell I'd have to hand it back over.  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  Did that officially happen?  I think so.  I hope so.  Yeah, so he won.  That was big news in the sports world. 
[00:37:00]  And more big news.  I used to be a Mets fan.  And Jose Reyes is gone.  Why?  The Mets sucked so bad last year, and now they don't even have Jose anymore as they go into  the next year.  He signed with the Marlins.  He ain't gonna stick around.  The Mets are in deep fucking financial trouble.  They lost $70 million last year.  Six years, $102 million deal.  How do you lose $70 million?  No one was going to the games because the Mets had a rough year.  That's just it, yeah.  That's unbelievable.  Brand new field, too. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, who's gonna go?  Who's gonna go see a Mets game next year without Jose Reyes?  Are you kidding me?  Ah, just a fun day out at the park.  Isn't he the best player in baseball right now?  Or one of them?  I don't know enough to answer that question.  I just don't fucking care.  Harry's great.  He's gotta be right up there, sure.  The Mets don't have him anymore.  He's signed with the Marlins for six years.  Well, you'll still go to the games.  I'll go.  Of course you will.  Good.  But, wow.  Isn't that related to the Bernie Madoff thing?  Yeah, they lost a lot of money.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Didn't they lose a lot of money through the Bernie Madoff shit?  Yeah.  Shit.  They were invested.  And, yep.  More people that got fucked over.  Whoops.  So that's a bummer for the remaining Mets fans.  Good luck.  Keep up your good nature.  Yeah.  Good for you.  And there was that Occupy Wall Street woman.  She's in one of my videos.  She was protesting down there, making sandwiches for the guys and all the protesters down there 
[00:38:30]  and waving signs around.  Her earlier sign said something like, you know, she'll vote after the revolution and Reagan  sucks and things like that.  Reagan.  Is it the one with the glasses?  Yeah.  That's in the paper today?  Yeah.  I filmed her with a sign that said, Reagan sucks balls.  Yeah.  And she also had a sign that said, I support cops that smoke pot.  Yep.  Oh, I remember that.  I've seen that.  Yeah, that's in one of my videos.  Well, that lady.  She realized she was not going.  Is a big star today.  Yeah, she realized she wasn't going to get anything with that sign. 
[00:39:00]  So she put up another sign that she's a PhD in biomedical science.  Right.  And somebody was walking around, saw that, looked at her resume, and hired her to work with a  Wall Street financial firm.  So she said, all right, fuck this broadcast.  So she immediately went, okay, and dumped the Occupy Wall Street to take a job on Wall Street.  And I would gather, most of those people would do exactly the same, right? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  If you're being offered a nice, cushy job, you're going to take it.  Now, she's not making money hand over fist, as they say now, but she's got the potential  of making a lot of money if she sticks with this and does well.  Do you think at any point when she starts making money that she's going to want to be taxed up  the ass to pay for things that these people were asking for that she was cohorting with?  Nope.  I don't either.  Nope.  I don't either.  Well, that's in the paper today, huh? 
[00:40:00]  Yep.  Oh, wow.  It's like front and center.  You know how annoying that must be for someone who got like laid off, who's been like hitting  the pavement, all she had to do is stand out there with a fucking sign that said pot on  it.  Some guy who wanted to fuck her hired her.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, you know damn well she's going to be getting her hiney pinched.  Yeah.  I hope so.  Pinch that ass.  Yeah.  No surprise there.  Most people would take that gig.  Of course. 
[00:40:30]  That ain't her, is it?  Yeah, Sam's trying to find her so we could show you the, it's the freak show video I did  for the people that know.  She's the guy with the dumb rat, the bear girl.  I miss bear girl.  I never saw her again.  Well, hopefully she's missing.  I don't think I'd go down there anymore.  Zuccotti Park's pretty much dead.  There's nothing going on.  There she is.  There's the chick.  Yeah, that was the chick.  Watch.  Ronald Reagan sucked balls.  And then she flipped it over. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, wait.  See, that's the one.  I love cops.  It's funny.  Some people say, no, no, turn around the other side.  And then the other people say, no, no, turn around, you know, so.  It works.  Either side works for you, right?  Hey, I'm talking here.  Chill out.  This is my interview.  Chill out.  Chill out.  Oh, God.  So she's got a nice job.  She's working on Wall Street.  Yes, with a financial firm.  You know, the enemy. 
[00:41:30]  That makes you happy, right?  It certainly does.  It just shows another part that just shows the hypocrisy of these douchebags.  And the UC Davis clip of the cop pepper spraying, that line of students that were sitting down.  Sure.  I watched the entire, I guess it was about 10 minutes of video.  There's a longer clip on that?  Chronological order of everything that happened up till the spraying of the pepper spray.  Which I'm going to stop you for a second.  Yeah.  Mainstream media. 
[00:42:00]  We're talking CNN, MSNBC, Fox, and you go ABC, NBC, CBS, all of them.  They all probably could have done what you just did.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Easily.  Easily.  Just wanted to make that perfectly clear to the people out there.  The video started out with some demonstrators standing around, a bunch of cops in a field saying,  you have to move.  You have to leave.  This isn't allowed.  It's not a legal gathering or whatever.  Whatever the case may be.  The people started circling the cops, encircling them. 
[00:42:30]  And the cops started arresting people.  They arrested, I guess, maybe 15 people or so, put them in a truck, and then the students  surrounded the cops, the vehicles, and blocked their way and said, we're not letting you.  My check, my check, my check, my check.  We are not letting you leave until you free our brothers and sisters that have been arrested.  And the cops are like, no, we're leaving.  And again, five more times, the cops went up to who they perceived as some type of leadership 
[00:43:00]  in this organization and told them, look, you have to move or you will be arrested.  We are going to use certain avenues to get you to move.  They blocked the cops in.  They locked arms and put a circle around all the officers so they couldn't physically leave  without grabbing these students in some way, shape, or form and physically moving them  out of the way.  After numerous warnings and threats that they were not going to let these cops leave the 
[00:43:30]  area, they started shaking up the pepper spray cans, telling them what was going to happen.  The protesters knew it was coming.  They said, cover your mouth, cover your eyes, but didn't move.  And then they got pepper sprayed.  Oh, OK, so they were surrounding the cops at that moment.  Yeah, the cops were surrounded without a way to leave and take these prisoners with them.  But more importantly, it needs to be noted, the media must have had the long clip, but 
[00:44:00]  chose that it was a much better fucking picture to just show the cops pepper spraying what  looks like a peaceful protest.  Right.  They're just sitting down.  Is it the same angle?  Is it the same video?  No, it's all in chronological order from different video.  But you could tell it's actually what happened.  And there's some text on there that lets you know what's going on, too.  To be fair, you think the media had this whole thing before they just chose to go with the  one moment? 
[00:44:30]  I don't know.  Fox would have showed this.  Fox would have taken the side of the cops probably.  Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.  Are they going to show it today?  Set them free.  OK.  Are they going to show it today now that the full story's out there?  I would hope so.  That's a question.  I doubt it.  Like, set them free, they're yelling, and then...  Let's march peacefully.  Let's march peacefully.  As one.  As one.  Towards what they're being held.  Towards what they're being held.  Weird, dummy.  The guy must have a hair lip.  So now they're going to get up and march to where the arrested people, and they're yelling, 
[00:45:00]  set them free, and then they surround the cops and the vehicle with the prisoners in  it, and they're like, look, get the fuck up or we're going to spray you.  Set them free.  Set them free.  Set them free.  All right, this goes on and on.  These stupid little bad cats.  Set them free.  There's no passion to these people.  What is that, Burberry she's wearing there?  What is that?  Yeah, it looks like Burberry.  What is that?  No, something sport. 
[00:45:30]  Remember the something sport is?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  Jan sport.  Ah, yes, yes.  All nice stuff.  Jan sport's all right.  Yeah.  Well, thanks for that, Ant.  There you go.  So there's the real story.  And they were given so many warnings.  And you can see they're surrounded.  There's an entire perimeter around these cops who are standing in the middle saying, all  right, you know, should we just...  Plow through them, grab a few and toss them to the side or... 
[00:46:00]  Mm-hmm.  You know, they're like, you got to get up.  You got to move.  Yeah.  Cops telling them, right?  How annoyed do you think these cops are right now just waiting?  Oh, I know.  Just crack their heads open.  I didn't realize that they were physically surrounding them.  See, you're right.  That doesn't make a huge difference.  Yeah.  And they were patient.  I mean, they sat there.  And then even the spraying, in the wrong context, it looks like the cop is so just, hey, here's  a little pepper spray for your faces.  But he didn't want it to look like, like, I'm in here.  Fuck you. 
[00:46:30]  You know, taking combat stance and spraying it.  It's like, look, you've been warned probably seven times.  Here it is.  All right.  Now what?  Wow.  That's really great.  Well, let's see if mainstream media does a whole piece on this now that the whole story  is out there.  Children?  They're calling themselves children?  Yeah.  They're like, don't shoot the children.  I fucking hate them.  I know.  All right.  Oh, boy.  And there was a problem.  Washington, I guess, D.C. had their Occupy D.C. thing going on.  And the cops were kicking their asses out of there and got into a little scuffle, fewer 
[00:47:00]  arrests.  They were trying to tear down some structure that the protesters made so they could have  heat.  And cops ripped that down.  Hit the road.  Hit the bricks.  Is any of the Occupy's holding strong?  Eh, I'm sure there's a few here and there, but nothing like it was.  Most of the main cities have gone away.  It's a footnote.  Although they've moved indoors.  It's a footnote. 
[00:47:30]  They've moved indoors.  This office is being used down near Wall Street.  It's so funny because they don't know what to do.  They're like, eh, like when Obama was here, he's staying at the Sheridan in the city, they  were all like, yeah, let's run there.  And they all run there to protest.  It's like, oh, there's something going on at the U.N.  Whoa.  They all run down there.  They're just running.  To get mommy and daddy to notice them.  Shut up.  Creeps.  You don't think they're sincere?  No.  They're dunces.  All right. 
[00:48:00]  We should take a break.  Oh, there he is.  Hi, Kenny.  We got the Herman Cain shit this weekend.  It was terrific.  He rules.  He fucking rules.  That guy is out of his bird.  I love it.  He's terrific.  Plan B, motherfuckers.  And we were just talking about the gay.  Nigeria.  Wait till you hear what they want to do with the gay.  I called it something different growing up.  Wait till you hear what they want to do.  Give somebody $10 million if they send them $1,000?  Look, we think you should be able to...  Those Nigerians. 
[00:48:30]  We think you should be able to say tranny in a comical form, obviously, when you're trying  to tell a joke, especially.  Yeah.  But then you get this.  This is just ridiculous.  Just taking it to a new level of hatred.  Of course.  Of course.  We'll explain next.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Mysterious.  Next time.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  Or else it gets the hose.  And when it's done, there's one more thing.  A simple little task. 
[00:49:00]  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  Helps me not to think of them as human.  So I call them it instead of by their names.  Mister, please no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse? 
[00:49:30]  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  I'll starve you so your skin gets loose.  Stop crying out your big fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote.  I'm impervious to all your silly whining.  So write down before I jam a bath.  Write down your fucking throat. 
[00:50:00]  Mister, please no more.  My mom's got money.  Let me go.  This isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose.  Don't be a dummy.  Listen to your scream and wail.  Keep it down, you fucking wail.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway but failed.  Precious? 
[00:50:30]  Precious?  She's down here, you piece of shit.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I'd kill you but there's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you.  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell fat girls in a fucking store.  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend. 
[00:51:00]  You don't know what pain is but I'll teach you.  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  Good morning.  Thanks for calling Radio Shack.  My name is Danny.  How can I help you?  I used to have the thing on my TV where you can download shit from, you know, like, through, 
[00:51:30]  you know, the air, satellite.  Like Wi-Fi?  Wi-Fi, whatever.  Here's the thing.  But, I mean, that's not working now because...  This is Radio Shack.  Do you need, like, an AC adapter?  Maybe get somebody to come over and fix it.  Well, I mean, we really...  This is Radio Shack, you know, so we don't really...  We don't really do that.  Oh.  We sell products.  Oh, I see.  Well, I mean, I'm not supposed to do this but, like, I mean, did you get into your router  settings and take a look in there?  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  Like, just look into your router settings.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right here. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, exactly, right.  So get in there and then, you know, make sure that your Wi-Fi is enabled.  But where do you fucking wire it into?  Well, I mean, it should just be wired right from your cable modem.  It should just be right in there.  Yeah.  Why?  How do you know that?  Because that's just how it works.  Are you talking about the hot, what is the heavy, thick wire you're talking about?  You mean like a Cat5?  You're talking about a...  You know, Ethernet kit?  Yeah, they call them, I think they call them hot wires.  Fire wire?  Fire wire.  Dude, do you need, like, a universal AC adapter or a soldering iron?  What's that?  Dude, I just...  Let me just get back to work, man. 
[00:52:30]  Like, can you open a browser and get to the web?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Yeah, yeah, it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Are you on the web?  Okay, so now...  Can you go to a website?  Can you do that?  You hook it up, okay?  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage?  Is it that easy?  Yes!  Click.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I see it.  Jeez.  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Is that it?  Is that it for good?  Is that...  Am I set for life?  Yeah, yeah, that's it, dude.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Thank you for helping me.  Yeah, man, no problem, dude. 
[00:53:00]  There were some other tech questions I needed.  Oh, oh, Facebook.  No, no, no, no.  No, no!  I'm up to my limit of friends.  No!  If you want a cordless phone or some LEDs, fine.  I'm up to my limit of friends, 5,000.  I'm not helping with Facebook.  I think somebody set up a fan page.  I'm hanging up!  How do I get people to go there?  Instead of sending me friend requests.  You know him as Vinny's lovable uncle from MTV's Jersey Shore.  Oh, what the fuck?  Now the Sicilian funny man brings his act straight off the boat and on to Broadway.  Listen, I gotta say something. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, shut the fuck up!  Let me fucking talk.  Uncle Nino presents Bad Jokes and Wine.  I've been drinking all fucking week.  We're making toast to the crack that never heals.  The more you rub it, the better it feels.  You can scrub it from me to hell.  You never get rid of that fishy smell.  Fucking fuck.  I love you.  Come see what nobody else will as the stereotypical Italian recites line after line of adolescent  toilet humor.  First time I had sex, I was so scared, I was all by myself.  I says, I was with this guy.  I says, honey, is it in?  He says, yes. 
[00:54:00]  Well, start walking towards me now.  Oh.  I ask this guy, I says, buddy, did you ever see the numbers on the condoms?  He says, what numbers?  So I guess you don't have to roll the back down for ya.  Wow.  Never before has an offensive cartoonish caricature told so many bad jokes in one hour, writes  the Daily News.  I laughed once, then wondered why I had, said the New York Post. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I have to say one last thing, I'll show up.  I promise I'll show up.  I love black women.  I always take a shot in the dark.  And when asked, the New York Times said they didn't bother to show up and review it.  I was with this girl, I says, miss, did you ever have a 16-second orgasm?  She says, no.  She says, you got a fucking minute?  What the fuck?  It's Uncle Nino's Bad Jokes and Wine.  Hey, God bless everybody.  Who gives a fuck?  Live on Broadway for as long as people still give a shit about the Jersey Shore. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, what the fuck?  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good golly, Miss Marley.  Good golly, Miss Marley. 
[00:55:30]  Get in topic. 
[00:56:00]  Hold up, wait a minute.  With the Sex Man.  Sexy, what do we got today?  Good morning.  Good morning, sexy.  Well, today, little Richard is 79. 
[00:56:30]  79 years old.  79 years young, I would say.  Young.  Is he still living in that hotel?  Really?  Wasn't it the Hyatt on Sunset?  I don't know.  We would go out there every once in a while for radio,  and he had, like, the whole penthouse or something,  and we would see him coming and going from time to time.  He couldn't just live there.  Did he still have that kind of money to fucking just live in a hotel penthouse?  I don't know, man.  Howard Hughes?  I remember back in the day, we definitely saw little Richard, 
[00:57:00]  and it was told to us that he was living in the Hyatt on Sunset.  Huh.  Uh, E-Rock, you put together the Patrice thing.  Yes.  With the help of the boys at E-Rock.  Yeah, you're getting praise, my friend.  You're getting praise.  I'm getting used to it.  Yeah.  A lot of people enjoyed the Patrice special.  I personally could not fucking listen whatsoever.  I didn't hear it.  I heard Kenny put some on when we were on the road,  and I just couldn't hear it.  You couldn't, right?  No.  It's rough.  Yeah, you need a little time going by.  But I want to acknowledge that E-Rock put together a hell of a special. 
[00:57:30]  He certainly did.  Thank you.  But what you going to do for me today?  Today, motherfucker.  So.  Eh, E-Rock.  Just want to get past the Patrice thing in whatever way that is.  Yep, today at the services, um, this afternoon.  Yeah, that's, uh, berg.  Yep.  I hate these things.  No, no one likes them. 
[00:58:00]  Nah.  But I really, really detest them.  Everyone does.  They're unpleasant.  Yeah.  They really are unpleasant.  Sure.  I figure it's, like, you know, for the family.  Right.  Huh?  For the family, I figure, you know.  That's what you're doing it for.  Oh, of course.  Of course.  You're doing it for me.  I hate that.  Even when it's my family, I don't like shit like this.  It's just like, oh.  No one likes it, though.  Yeah, no one enjoys it.  No one's like, oh, what time's the wake?  Fuck, yes.  Right.  I don't know.  I think some people do.  Huh?  I think there are some people that do.  Enjoy it? 
[00:58:30]  Well, yeah.  Maybe old people.  Yeah, old people.  I think old people get death.  Because by the time they're old, they've seen so many people go.  I know.  Just the fact that it's happening, like, tells you somebody enjoys it.  Just the fact that people do it.  I think it's like, oh, we got to have this and this and this.  How about nothing?  How about a picture?  I think it's closure.  Some fucking music playing.  It is closure.  No, it's about, people are like ritualistic. 
[00:59:00]  And how do you like, death is the end of it.  It's the one thing we'll never conquer.  How do you get beyond it?  And this is how we get beyond it.  It's like a weird way of saying goodbye and putting it to bed.  Yeah.  It's just a way we move it.  It's a necessity.  Huh.  It's not about being fun or being maudlin or morbid.  Yeah.  It's literally about, I think, nature.  Because we're aware of our own mortality.  Even chimps are to a certain degree.  Like, they all stare at the body and the...  Yeah.  You know, they get it.  So I think it's our way of getting beyond our own fucking mortality.  It's a weird, necessary ritual. 
[00:59:30]  Open casket or closed casket?  I think closed.  I would hope closed.  I usually like closed.  No, it is closed.  Oh, it is?  Oh, I would hope it's closed.  It was going to be open for a while.  What?  Now it's closed.  I don't like open.  It should always be closed, I think, yeah.  Yeah.  Open casket is a little morbid.  That's old school.  Yeah.  That's fucking old school shit.  When our pal Gavin died last year, right around now, my brother, Brett's best friend,  you know, the owner of FH Riley's, and he pretty much grew up with us, Gavin.  And they went open casket about this time last year. 
[01:00:00]  He was only 41.  Gavin, it was rough, man.  That open casket is rough.  Old person, open casket, I don't mind.  They look the same.  Well, yeah, that's true.  Morbid curiosity, I guess.  But when they're young, fuck.  I never look.  Huh?  I don't look.  You don't go up?  Nope.  It's hard.  I don't go up.  I don't even look.  From the back of the room, I won't even turn to the front of the room to look.  Really?  I avert my eyes.  Are you scared you're going to cry?  No, I just don't. 
[01:00:30]  I don't want to be, I don't want to be, uh, uh, have that memory.  No, I don't want to have the memory of that person like that.  Yeah.  I like having the memory of the person alive and fucking, you know, when you saw him last.  Yeah.  This ain't a makeup for, you know, oh, well, I should have seen him like last week instead  of last month.  Now let me see him today.  Oh, that's right.  He's dead.  Yeah.  Uh.  I hate that.  It's creepy.  You know why I go up?  Why?  Curiosity.  See, I can't, because I know that he can't transcend fucking morbid.  I know the person's not there and I know there's nothing I could say up there at the casket. 
[01:01:00]  It's just like, I go up for curiosity.  Like, oh, that's how he looks now.  You know, I remember years ago, like, uh, going to my grandfather's funeral and everybody kind  of shuffles past and you do a little kneel thing in front of the casket and you, you put  your hands together like you're a little praying thing.  And, and, and then, uh, you know, I was supposed to do that.  So I did it.  And like, it's such a, it's such a farce because I was supposed to be praying, I guess. 
[01:01:30]  And all I could do is sit, kneel there with my, my hands in prayer fashion going, oh my  God, get me away from here.  This is so creepy.  How long do I have to stay here before it looks like I, you know, so it looks like I was  actually praying.  I'm not praying.  I go, oh God, I hate, look at his face.  Oh shit.  If he opens his eyes, I'm going to freak out.  You're, you're saying what pretty much everyone does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You are.  It's like, okay.  I, I, I count to like 10.  How do you count?  Slowly.  One, 100.  One, 100.  Three, 100. 
[01:02:00]  Uh, so, but today's the day.  And then, uh, I think tomorrow becomes something a little different, you know?  Yeah.  And then you just kind of, you kind of just, uh, let's go.  Let the old days pile up behind you and, uh, hope it gets better.  That's it.  That's how it works.  It does.  You know, it does.  It is, it is what it is.  Yeah.  I mean, within 50 years, we'll all be in the box, you know, within 50 fucking years.  50.  I'll take 50.  But you know what I'm saying?  Like, that's how it's, it's not like, wow, we're going to miss him for 10,000 years. 
[01:02:30]  10,000 years.  We're here for a hundred.  He left in 40.  He should have left in 90.  We'll leave in 30 more.  It's like that brief.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It stinks, but it, you know, I was, I was watching a documentary, uh, about, uh, these  cave paintings and there was handprints on the walls and, and they're going, yeah, this  is 30,000 years old.  These, uh, you know, Cro-Magnon men, uh, were painting, uh, horses and, and tigers and stuff 
[01:03:00]  like that.  And then the guy just put his handprint up on the wall.  It's like, that's fucking 30,000 years ago.  And, and, and it was just an asshole that didn't, didn't have any artistic ability.  So he said, fuck, my hand.  And it was just, uh, it's like, fuck man, that's, that seems like a really long time  ago, but that isn't really even a long time ago.  But, but, but in, in, in our lifetime, that's huge.  That's like fucking sure.  15 times Jesus age for the universe. 
[01:03:30]  That's barely a blank.  That's nothing.  Not even a blank.  Doesn't register, but 30,000 years.  And then, yeah, you realize, all right, yeah.  Well, got our limited time here.  Don't we?  Well, yeah.  Patrice reminds us all of that.  And that's the, you know, it's the mortality thing hits everyone hard when someone young  dies.  And then what do you do?  Fuck.  It makes it, the thing that makes it a little bit easier for me is knowing that had he lived, 
[01:04:00]  you know, it's a stroke.  It's like for a while, it's a touch and go.  Had he pulled through or had he been able to pull through, he would have been in a terrible,  terrible situation and it never would have gotten better.  Never.  Or if it did, it would have been literally 1%.  Like, I was wanting him to die because I wanted him to be free.  I want my friend to not sit and be in this horrible, horrible place.  Yeah.  And it made it a little bit easier to see it as like, thank fucking God, man, I'm not  going to have to think of him for the next five years. 
[01:04:30]  Like, oh God, is he itchy?  Is he feet?  Years.  I would literally for a month, every night, I would just be panic stricken thinking, does  he have an itch he can't scratch?  Is he, does his tube hurt?  Like, you can't stop thinking of that.  It's all consuming.  Everything you do, you're thinking of it.  Yeah.  And so I'm relieved that he's not going to have to be in that kind of horrible, horrible  pain with that frustration.  And he would have wanted that.  Of course.  I think so.  There's not even a doubt in anyone's mind.  I believe so, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  So it makes it slightly easier than just a guy hit by a drunk driver.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  That's, oof.  Hey, Iraq, a lot of questions about the weekend.  And, uh, the Patrice tribute on Audible?  Uh, no, we, we didn't, uh, I mean.  Will it be?  Iraq did.  We're going to try to work something out with it.  Yeah, because we.  See, get it.  Light in the mood, yes.  Theoretically, we could.  I mean, why, right?  We could, but I, well, they take it that large.  That's the thing.  We could do it in a different question.  That's a good question.  You fucking take it that large.  You like that file?  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  You better take it.  You better take it.  Fuck yeah.  Sit on that file.  All right, because a lot of people want to know.  Well, we're trying to, there's two things.  Number one is, you know, just letting them know this is a special thing separate from  the show.  And number two, it'd be nice if we could figure out a way to get the money to the family from  the special.  The money.  Yeah, that would be nice.  Good luck fucking dealing with that with the lawyers around here.  Yeah, it complicates things.  They might allow it.  We officially haven't asked, but we will.  But I, I just, I would assume that there'll be some kind of issue with it.  It's you. 
[01:06:00]  But we'll see.  So.  Those are the only.  Oh my God, but Audible should be able to pop it up there.  No problem.  Oh yeah, I mean, it's just a matter of us sending it to them.  So it's so easy, but it's just, you know, making sure it's done.  I will figure it out.  Because a lot of people are asking because they didn't hear the whole thing.  It was like 16 hours of material.  16 hours.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's a lot.  16 hours.  A lot.  And we have another five for tomorrow, right?  Yeah, we, there was a lot that we, we couldn't even fit into that.  Yeah.  So tomorrow we'll be doing, I guess, volume two of, of, of tribute to Patrice. 
[01:06:30]  Bonus.  Yeah.  We'll call it the bonus Patrice stuff that we couldn't fit.  Like the country music one.  Country music.  Oh yeah.  Dealing with Chris Rock.  Chris Rock's calling today.  Yeah, he's in the call tonight.  Wow.  Chris Rock.  Chris Rock.  We haven't talked to him in a while.  So it's 9.30 on my paper.  No, maybe.  Oh, John Jones is in it at like 8.30.  This is 9 o'clock on my paper.  Yeah, it's 9 o'clock.  It better be 9 o'clock.  Yeah, I believe it's 9.  We got a very fucking busy day today.  I want to get put in a hold. 
[01:07:00]  Huh?  I want to get put in a hold.  Oh yeah.  With John Jones?  I have to.  Yes, you do.  I might let him elbow me.  He's famous for his fucking elbows.  Maybe let him drive.  The people's elbow.  That's a famous elbow.  Maybe he'll drive an elbow into my fucking chest.  No.  Oh yeah, right?  No.  Oh fuck.  Let him give you a Charlie Horse with his elbow.  Ow, that would hurt so bad.  Dude, he's fighting in a week.  He's in as perfect a shape as you can be in.  John Jones is going to be in today?  Yeah.  That is awesome.  I know that.  I love John Jones.  I'm just saying that like, fuck, that's awesome. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm very happy about that one.  Big fan of John Jones.  He came out of nowhere, man.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Who's he fighting?  Leota Machida.  Yep.  Supposed to be, I think, Rashad, but he's hurt from the last fight.  Okay.  Herman Cain, everyone.  I love him.  I want to vote for him if he drops out.  Did he quote Pokemon?  Yes, he did.  That's awesome.  He certainly quoted the song from the Pokemon movie and even said, this is, you know, from  Pokemon.  He, uh...  It's crazy.  He rules, but he's a pathological liar, in my opinion. 
[01:08:00]  A sociopath.  He's batshit crazy, I think.  He's nuts.  This guy is nuts.  And his dumb fucking pizza.  Then he, he was, uh, saying goodbye to the race with his, uh, sunglasses on, like he's  a rock star up there.  Oh, yeah.  He pulled up in his big bus.  He got out in front of his, uh, brand new headquarters, which, it was supposed to be  like the big grand opening of his headquarters to tell everybody, hey, I'm not running.  Right. 
[01:08:30]  But, we got CaneSolutions.com, motherfucker.  Yeah, that's, that's what you want to do, is drop out of the race so you can start up  your website.  A website.  Go from running for president to, to a website.  To be excited about your new website.  That's, that was his plan B, as he called it.  Right.  But these women coming out like this, it's like, again, until people just start owning  it and going, yeah, I did that, until these scumbags start owning it, it's going to ruin  so many, and here's another one that may have been good, ruined, because he couldn't keep 
[01:09:00]  his dick in his pants.  None of them keep their dicks in their pants, and they shouldn't.  And these broads can't keep their fucking mouths shut up.  Ah, they're all whores.  Just shut up.  Why come forward?  I don't want anything for this.  I don't want any money.  I don't want, then shut up.  He might be a great president, you cunt.  Right.  Just because he stuck his dick in your face for a job interview.  Yeah, the president's supposed to be infallible and fucking morally untouchable and stuff.  No.  So maybe the guy, maybe the best presidents are fucking womanizers.  Kennedy?  You don't think he'd be a great president?  Kennedy was good.  No, but I'm saying general, though, like, we don't know. 
[01:09:30]  He's nuts.  No, and he has no clue what goes on outside of a godfather's pizza, never mind.  Sure.  Outside the fucking U.S.  Yeah.  I got no experience about world places and stuff.  What not.  Right.  Jimmy, a lot of people are asking if the wake is public.  Not to my knowledge, no.  Okay.  I don't think it is.  No.  I could have just said, I don't know, and said, not to my knowledge.  I don't have to sound smarter.  Okay.  Well, here's Herman Cain suspending his presidential campaign. 
[01:10:00]  So as of today, with a lot of prayer and soul searching, I am suspending my presidential campaign.  Hey, where are the white women at?  I am suspending my presidential campaign.  In person.  Because of the continued distraction, the continued hurt caused on me and my family, not because 
[01:10:30]  we are not fighters, not because I'm not a fighter.  It's just that when I went through this reassessment of the impact on my family.  First, my family, the impact on you, my supporters, your support has been unwavering and undying, as well 
[01:11:00]  What is the impact on the ability to continue to raise the necessary funds to be competitive?  We had to come to this conclusion.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Oh, Herman. 
[01:11:30]  I hate you.  Herman.  There goes Herman.  Herman.  Oh, Lordy Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he say.  Do what he say.  Hmm.  And now he's supporting Newt.  That's what they say.  He's going to throw his support behind Newt.  Do you think Newt's like, I don't need it?  Could you just not, maybe?  Don't say my name, please.  Please don't say my name.  I think the last poll said he had 4%, so that's not... 
[01:12:00]  Who, Herman?  Yeah.  He was leading for a while, a couple weeks ago, wasn't he?  They all were.  And people didn't know much about all of them, so it's kind of, you know, a mishmash of polls.  Right.  But, I don't know.  Newt doesn't really have any of this in-the-closet baggage, you know?  Everybody knows Newt.  Because he's an asshole front and center.  Yeah.  But they're not going to pull anything out that it's like, uh-oh, this is a secret thing about Newt. 
[01:12:30]  Everybody knows Newt and what he's done and been through and, you know, what he stands for.  He might be a viable Republican candidate.  Ugh.  Yeah.  You're starting to think that?  Might be.  Might be the guy.  Go, Obama.  Ugh.  I really want him again.  I can't deal with him in office for another four fucking years.  That's why I want him again.  I know, right?  What would happen to you, Ant, another four years? 
[01:13:00]  It's just, he's not, even his support is saying he just doesn't do anything.  17-day vacation in Hawaii now?  Nice.  17 fucking days in Hawaii while the country just fucking burns.  Nice.  What a dick.  Sorry.  You would take that 17-day vacation, wouldn't you?  Well, you know what?  If the nation's resting on my shoulders, maybe I'd cut it a little short.  I'm not allowed to take a 17-day vacation here, motherfucker.  I can't, you know?  I get yelled at. 
[01:13:30]  That is a long vacation.  But end of the year, everybody shuts down.  All the businesses shut down.  Is that what it is?  It's a perfect time to take a 17-day vacation.  With all this shit going on.  Perfect.  Ugh.  He's just a tool.  Well, your Romney's a little rough.  He doesn't like, why?  He just looks like any day he could have a nervous breakdown.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He just looks like something is going to fucking pop in his head.  He's going to lose his mind.  Yeah, I don't know.  You guys had three years to figure this shit out.  Yeah.  That is true.  Everyone's so scared to run, I think. 
[01:14:00]  Is that what's going on?  Yeah, who wants to be under that fucking microscope?  Hope the Donald runs.  Oh, God.  What, the Donald, he wants to have a debate?  I hope so.  Maybe he could say to somebody, you're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  I'd love that if you could fire somebody.  We'd say that to the Congress.  You're all fired.  Who told the Donald to go fuck himself?  Was it Huntsman?  Hopefully the whole country.  Well, I guess if you don't know, Donald Trump's trying to get a debate together.  The Donald Trump debate or something. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  I think Newt said, yeah, I'll do it.  And I think it's Huntsman basically saying, go fuck yourself.  I'm not joining your debate.  How much attention does he need?  You're fired.  You're fired.  There we go.  He said it.  He fired the person.  Please.  I like his son a lot, though, man.  He's a very nice dude.  Yeah.  I really like, what is it, Donald Jr.?  Donald Jr., I like, too.  I like him a lot.  I follow him on Twitter.  He was in here once.  He couldn't have been cooler.  But I still have a tough time with his father. 
[01:15:00]  I understand why Donald is arrogant.  You kind of have to be a guy who does business like that.  You can't just be this humble fucking carpet.  Right, right.  You've got to have a certain cocksuredness.  Cocksure.  But I guess, I don't know, my interactions with him have been unpleasant both times.  He wasn't rude or terrible.  He just wasn't at all personable.  So I just have no desire to think about him positively.  Yeah.  Yeah, he didn't have nice things to think about.  You're fired.  You're fired.  He fired the entire Congress.  He's getting things done, hun. 
[01:15:30]  If you elect me, I'll fire everybody.  I'll fire the Congress.  They're fired.  He said it.  Hey, man.  I enjoy a good catchphrase.  What are you doing to me, Jimmy?  What are you doing to me?  He's distracting the people.  He's distracting the people with his catchphrase.  He'll say it all the time.  I'm going to fire high taxes.  High taxes are fired.  Nothing worse than shoehorning a catchphrase, huh?  It's hideous.  Spice is catchphrase. 
[01:16:00]  The weakest link.  She was shoehorning that one for a while.  Yeah, she really was.  Goodbye.  You are the weakest link.  What happened to her?  She's actually doing porn.  Ah, cool.  Granny porn.  Yeah.  She's the new star in granny porn.  I've read that, too.  I said...  No, it's a porn story.  I'm like, what am I doing?  Oh.  Stop.  Just check yourself.  Or wreck yourself.  I literally have been watching interracial cuckold porn. 
[01:16:30]  Oh.  And I like when the husband films.  And it's just something really hot and humiliating about it.  And this one woman I saw, it's one of the fucking hottest clips I've ever seen.  Really?  Fucking...  A guy with a massive dick and her husband's filming.  And the black guy's making the woman blow him.  And again, for years that did nothing for me.  But she's calling him, sir, while he fucks her.  She's like, yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  It was so fucking dirty.  Oh, Jesus.  And what was the guy saying?  Anything?  Was he clamming up behind the camera? 
[01:17:00]  Or was he saying anything?  The husband?  I don't remember.  Maybe.  I think at one point...  Oh, this is my favorite.  At one point, she's crawling.  She's blowing the guy.  And the husband says, get up on the bed.  So she does.  And he goes, now get in breeding position.  Breeding position?  Get in breeding position.  Oh, it was so dirty.  What was breeding position?  Hands and knees.  Ready to take it?  Hands and knees.  It was so fucking rude.  Did the brother slip her the big one?  Yeah, but he wasn't unreasonable with his penis.  Like, I think he knew that his penis was more than the average fucking human can handle. 
[01:17:30]  So, like, he was giving it to her, but he wasn't, like, he wasn't trying to.  You could see he wasn't trying to hurt her.  He just pounded balls deep.  Yeah.  Like that horse video.  Yeah.  Although I did see one like that, too.  Lady in the kitchen being fucked.  Yeah.  And the husband kept encouraging the guy to, like, go deeper.  What is...  I don't know, but it's just...  What is the thing there?  It's hot to watch in pornographic.  I don't think I could do it, but it's fun to watch.  Don't think I could do it?  You have to put the word think in there?  Sure, I'm a pervert, dude.  Yeah, but that's beyond pervert. 
[01:18:00]  That's something else.  I don't know.  I like some perverse shit, but that's like...  That goes against everything you're with a girl for.  It's just...  It really is, like...  Like, I wouldn't like watching that if I didn't know the girl.  I think you're traditional.  Yeah, that's me.  That's me.  I think you've got a little traditional in you.  Yeah, that's me.  A little bit.  Yeah.  What, are you going to put it until marriage?  Oh.  Traditional guy.  What's the new charges with this Sandusky? 
[01:18:30]  Do we know?  I haven't heard anything.  We got new charges, man.  Being a good egg.  I don't know.  Charges...  The last...  The newest thing I read this morning was that he specifically said that...  What's his name?  Never...  Paterno never asked him...  Yeah, Paterno.  ...at all.  Yeah.  About any child stuff whatsoever.  In 88 or...  That's not unbelievable.  This guy's a fucking creep.  Look at him.  Yeah, he's a fucking creep.  He's just walking around out there, though, man. 
[01:19:00]  He happens until he's trial.  He can't, you know...  He's just walking around.  He's Christmas shopping.  Just imagine this.  Sandusky's...  He's Christmas shopping.  He should wear a shirt that just...  Oh, I was in Baltimore and I made fun of him on the station I was on.  And there are people...  Oh...  What happened?  Nothing.  They're really a fun show, but apparently they were joctobered.  Oh.  By us?  Yeah, and the girl was really cool.  I walked in and she goes, hi, I'm the hole.  Oh, shit.  It was the guy, Mickey and Amelia, in Baltimore. 
[01:19:30]  But they were...  It's one of the most fun...  Honestly, one of the most fun terrestrial shows I've done in years.  I wonder why we hold them.  We just got a bad show or whatever.  I don't remember, though.  But I made fun of Sandusky and there's a Jerry Sandusky working...  ...there as a sportscaster in Boston.  I'm sorry, in Baltimore, but he spells it with a G.  But he's been getting hate mail and death threats as well.  Oh, that's got to suck.  Jerry Sandusky.  I'm sure he doesn't want to change his name.  He's been developing that name for years, probably.  Yeah.  Oh, that blows.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  Where was Sandusky Christmas shopping?  No, I'm just saying.  I mean...  Oh, I thought they saw him out there.  Everyone else is, so you've got to assume he's out there and he's able to Christmas shop.  Toys are...  Cutting the bottoms out of Oshkosh Pagosh.  You know what I noticed?  I was just thinking about O.J. yesterday because I saw Al Michaels.  Oh, yeah.  Every time you see Al Michaels, you kind of go, I wonder how O.J. is there.  Why do you associate him with O.J.?  O.J.  They used to be good friends.  Oh, okay.  And you know that he was sentenced three years ago already? 
[01:20:30]  Three years.  Is that possible?  Yeah.  Sentenced 33 years in prison for armed robbery.  Three years ago, that went down.  Has he been in prison for three years already?  Fucking O.J. really screwed the pooch on that one, didn't he?  Dude, you got away with it.  I know.  He got away with it.  You got away.  You fucking cut...  Almost cut her head off and you're fucking still walking around banging blonde, you dummy.  And he had to fucking hold up some people.  What an idiot.  Oh, what a stupid asshole. 
[01:21:00]  You skated.  And he'll do a lot of those 33 years, man.  He has to do 11, I think.  Am I wrong?  Well, he's done three already, I guess.  Two years already.  By the time he gets out, though, how old is he?  How old is fucking O.J.?  45?  He's a lot older than that.  He's got to be at least...  Perhaps more than that.  I'm going to go 63.  He'll be 70.  Okay, maybe.  I'm going to go 63.  The answer is 64.  Wow.  When's his birthday, though? 
[01:21:30]  July.  So he's 63.  He'll be 64 in July?  No, he'll be 65 in July.  Damn it!  So he's 64.  64 is the answer to the question.  He's 64.  If he gets out in whatever, 10 years, you know, 74, 73, he's just going to be a disaster.  Yeah, and he got away with it, too, man.  We haven't heard any stories about O.J. in prison.  Like, there hasn't been any news.  What's he doing?  I don't know.  Does he just sit around, or is he active in prison, killing people? 
[01:22:00]  What does he do?  Is he working out?  Does he work in a license plate factory?  I bet you he's jovial.  Yeah, you think he's a pleasant guy?  Yeah, I think he's laughing a lot.  They'd probably like him in jail.  He's O.J.  I mean, he's O.J.  He's O.J.  He's O.J.  Killed white people.  They got away with murder.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they got all of them.  He really, really did do bad things.  Wee wee.  How annoying would it be if I just developed a fucking R-lisp? 
[01:22:30]  That'd be fun for everyone.  Why not?  This thing in February from the Daily Mail, so it says that he was beaten up.  Ah, yeah.  That was a rumor.  Yeah.  We don't know if that was true.  I don't believe anything in the Daily Mail.  Yeah, we don't know if that was true.  Lying, limey papers.  They're all full of shit.  Assholes.  Whenever you get a headline that says, you know, UFO lands, spacemen get out and greet  people.  And then you go, all right, let me read that.  Click.  And it's the Daily Mail.  And it's like, oh, this is a scenario that could happen if spacemen come down here. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, really?  Is that how you tease me?  You get three paragraphs in.  And it says it was a racial attack.  It was a skinhead.  He spent three weeks in the hospital, said the National Enquirer.  So this is their source.  Come on.  The Enquirer is actually a pretty good source, though.  Yeah, they've been right a lot.  Yeah, they're wrong a lot, but they're also right a lot.  Yeah.  And they're trying to be more right than wrong these days.  They're trying to get a little more respect.  They've been sued. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, they've lost a few lawsuits.  Yeah.  And are newspapers really bitter?  Well, you know what?  They stink.  But yeah, they're better than the Daily Mail.  The answer to that question is, yeah, they are better.  They just print lies in the Daily Mail that are blatant.  Like, I could read through the lies in our paper.  Oh, OJ update.  News 1 for Black America says OJ Simpson is bored out of his mind.  Bored out of his mind.  Oh, poor guy. 
[01:24:00]  That's got to suck.  What do you do?  Exactly.  Especially if you don't know how to read.  No, we don't need OJ's verdict.  Everyone has heard that a million times.  Why does he just talk to me?  Iraq, would you talk to everybody?  Stop talking to me only.  He's called you 50 times.  Just talk to everybody.  Just talk to everybody.  What did you say?  People know you now.  I have his 2008 verdict.  We don't need it.  Don't reference me again, athlete. 
[01:24:30]  Oh.  Don't reference me.  He referenced you an hour ago, Edgar.  Edgar.  I like it.  Anthony.  Anthony.  What is that?  It's dry.  Oppy nose.  Oppy.  Oppy.  You guys want to learn about Nigeria?  I think I can figure it out.  Yes.  See, we're reasonable people.  We think Neil Patrick Harris certainly should be able to say tranny on network TV.  We're reasonable men.  And then, of course, we completely disagree with this. 
[01:25:00]  This war shit.  Nigeria wants to ban homosexuality punishable by 14 years.  14 years.  In the areas in Nigeria's north where Islamic Sharia law has been forced for about a decade,  gays and lesbians can face death by stoning.  Under the proposed law passed by Senate this week, couples who marry could face up to 14 years each in prison.  Witnesses or anyone who helps couples marry could be sentenced to 10 years behind bars. 
[01:25:30]  So this is the gays that get married, right?  Yup.  The bill also punishes the public show of same-sex amorous relationships, directly or indirectly, with 10 years in prison.  So holding hands or kissing.  Or a little peck on your boyfriend's mouth there.  Or a blowjob.  Or a blowjob in public will get you 10 years.  Well, Sharia law is reasonable, though.  I mean, all the religions are the same, and it's good.  Sharia law is a great thing.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:26:00]  It's great.  They treat women well.  They treat gays well.  It's wonderful.  Sure.  Wonderful, wonderful way to live.  The bill must be passed by Nigeria's House of Representatives and signed by President Jonathan before becoming law.  You just know that's all corrupt, and like they talk about, yeah, it's got to sign into law, it's got to pass Congress, and such horse shit.  You think it'll be passed?  I don't know.  How much money is trading hands?  Nigeria, yeah.  If it's Sharia law, of course.  Well, that's only part of Nigeria, right?  They're saying?  That's probably a pretty fucking strong little arm of that place. 
[01:26:30]  Did you know that?  What?  That they had Sharia law?  I didn't know.  In North Nigeria?  I thought it was just pandemonium and fucking chaos over there.  Just everywhere?  I didn't even know they had some pseudo-government.  If people are fucking in jail, do their prison sentence get extended?  Oh, that's good.  Oh, jeez, Sam.  Kill a guy in jail.  Do an expose.  Get your ass over there in prison.  I'm not going to see what happens.  Go undercover.  Go deep undercover.  Yeah.  I just learned Sam's got some sick fantasies.  Breathing.  It's not a fantasy, but it's a good question.  What's a Nigerian armed robber that kisses back at his razor bumps and sodomize him? 
[01:27:00]  I'll kiss them bumps away for you, baby boy.  I'm doing better with my bumps.  You're not doing better.  Yes, I am.  Face is very red.  I know, because I had to put lotion on that irritates the skin at first, and then we'll  bring it back down.  Why did you have to irritate the skin?  Because it softens the skin, and that way the hair will be able to...  What kind of lotion is it?  Is it called the after-show lotion?  Irritates everything?  You would use a razor with just one blade.  One blade now. 
[01:27:30]  Why?  It's much better.  It is.  Right on your wrist.  Anytime I've used a one-bladed razor, it's terrible.  The shave is not nearly as close.  It's not a good shave, but in terms of bumps, it's much better.  So you'd rather have the Fred Flintstone look with the perpetual five o'clock shadow...  Than the bumps, yeah.  White guys don't get bumps, Sam.  No, they don't.  You've got to be part black.  My hair is coarse.  You've got to be part black.  There's so much black in you.  Yeah.  You are so Negro.  Bumpy bump, bump, bump. 
[01:28:00]  There are, I mean, the razors that I use are specifically...  I mean, they're black people.  Black people, right?  On the razor.  And do you use some cream for black people?  Yeah.  It's like black people cream.  Yeah.  They change, I think, I used to use an aftershave thing that was called Bump Patrol that used  to have black people on the Bump Patrol.  I love them, guys.  I listened to them in the 90s, the Bump Patrol.  They're good.  They used to have black people on the box, but I think now, then they started diversifying,  which I don't like, and put, like, white people on, too.  You need black people on the box so you know it works. 
[01:28:30]  That's bullshit.  It's like, you know, embrace the community.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know?  That's good.  All right.  But it's getting better.  Wait till you see.  I'd like to slap them off.  I wish that would work.  I wish that was my solution, just to keep slapping Sam's Bump until they melt it.  Until they fall off.  Yeah, until they fall off, like fucking those little candies that come on the paper and  you scrape them off of your teeth.  Dots.  Yeah, dots.  All right.  It'll work.  I would do that.  We're going to break.  We got Joe DeRose and Bill Burr probably next.  Then we got Jon Jones at 8.30.  Chris Rock at 9 o'clock.  9.30. 
[01:29:00]  9.30?  It is 9.30.  Yeah.  And I got an email confirming what we talked about before.  I'm not going to say it on the air.  It was 15 minutes.  I'll show it to you off here.  I've been livid this whole break.  What?  I'll show you off.  Oh, yeah.  Should we talk about it?  No.  Let's see what happens first.  Because again, it could be a...  I don't want to...  Especially with something like this.  Clear your throat.  I don't want to misspeak.  I'd rather wait.  Wow.  So I'll make love first.  Wow, wow, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  I'll take Sam. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Sam's not black.  His ancestor's Thomas Jefferson.  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thong.  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark. 
[01:30:00]  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure?  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a nigger.  White or a nigger.  Yeah, we're teasing, you know.  Because he's white with an afro.  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  You're listening to the O.P. Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  What's up, baby? 
[01:30:30]  You want to get some dirty talk going?  Yeah, that's it.  I'm going to give some cyber sex.  I'm good.  I'm going to lay your back or something.  And I'm going to lick all the way down your neck like this.  I'm going to take my tongue and just go like.  I'm going to clean out your ears or something and get waxed on my tongue and then lick all the way down your neck.  Oh, that's a nice dark nipple.  I wouldn't mind getting some milk out of that. 
[01:31:00]  And then I'm going to get my tongue and I'm going to start licking it all over your nipples so much that you start cumming.  You're going to cum so much that your shoes are going to make sloshy noises.  And I'm going to get down here and just start licking your fucking cuda really good.  I'll just, I'll open up your cuda.  I got, I got like long nails on my middle fingers.  So I'll dig my nails into your cuda lips and I'll open them up and I'll just go like.  And I'll get in there until you cum so many times or whatever. 
[01:31:30]  I'll stick it right in you too.  I'll climb right up on you like you're a building or something.  I'm going to climb on like you're a tree or something and just cram my oats in you.  Someone put a finger in my ass.  Here is XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Alright. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Got Joe DeRosa in studio.  What's up, Joe?  Oh.  And.  Jimmy, how are you guys?  Hold on.  Let me do the big plug here.  You're going to be at Caroline's.  Where's the Joe DeRosa sheet? 
[01:32:30]  You get a sheet now, man.  That's really shitty.  You get a fucking sheet.  Look at that.  That's nice.  It doesn't have a lot on it, but you've got a sheet officially.  Look at that.  You've got a sheet for Joe DeRosa.  I got a sheet.  What?  Next Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday at Caroline's, right?  Yeah.  The 15th, 16th, and 18th at Caroline's.  Or 14th, 15th, and 18th.  Excuse me.  14th, 15th, and 18th at Caroline's.  It's next week at Caroline's.  Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday at Caroline's.  We want to get a bunch of people at Caroline's for Joe DeRosa. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Oh, good, man.  Thanks, Jim.  Thank you.  That'll be awesome.  Yeah, yeah.  Right on, man.  It's a good week.  You know, it's fucking holidays.  It's nice.  Yeah, yeah.  It's good time.  Oh, good time.  Well, a lot of people in Times Square around the holiday season.  I don't know if driving business is not going through there as hurt Caroline's at  all, because people, it used to be like you'd have massive traffic.  Oh, right.  No, but now you've got the foot traffic, so it's probably easier for people to come in  and out.  I'm thinking.  Maybe.  There's so many more people down there.  You'd pass by with your car and be like, I can't park. 
[01:33:30]  Fuck this.  Now you're walking.  You're like, hey.  Fuck that DeRosa guy.  What is that?  I'd like to see it, but I can't park my car.  It is.  I mean, I live basically in Times Square, and it is a fucking shit show now.  They shut those lanes down.  I mean, it's like, it's awful, man.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then, conveniently, the day they shut the driving lanes down, the subway fares went  up.  The same fucking day.  It's like, did they really end up doing this?  Yeah.  I wonder what happened there.  I wonder what happened there. 
[01:34:00]  That sounds like one of those conspiracies.  They got us.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  So it sucks.  No matter what you do, they get you.  I'm right there, too.  I'm right there, too, which is kind of cool.  I got the Compound West apartment.  I like to call it the Compound West.  How about you just call it your home?  No.  What's wrong with you?  No, I need like a place.  Why does everything have to have a name?  I need a place.  Compound.  I need something with a big boulder with a name paint on it. 
[01:34:30]  Is it really a compound, though?  It's just a one-bedroom apartment that you could crash at every once in a while.  Well, yeah.  If I didn't have the Compound, I wouldn't call this a Compound, but since it's an offshoot,  it's a satellite of a Compound.  All right.  A satellite Compound.  Yeah.  All right.  Fair enough.  Are you going to have soirees at this Compound?  Well, it's a little small for a soiree.  All right.  Yeah.  It's more like a swingers party kind of place.  It's pretty much, yeah, it's pretty much in lieu of a hotel room. 
[01:35:00]  I have this.  Okay.  By the way, if I hear anybody in your camp referring to it as, hey, that would be a Compound West.  I'm going to fucking throw hot coffee on them.  I don't care who it is.  I know.  Anybody in your camp says that.  It really is bad.  He has people in his camp, too.  It's Camp Compound West.  I've got to upgrade some shit.  I need a camp.  Yeah.  Of people.  Yeah.  You need a Compound Westies. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Times Square this weekend.  We're going to be staying CW for the weekend, and then I'm going to go back.  Oh, no.  You don't do that.  Oh, no.  I guarantee he texts it, though.  I guarantee because it's faster.  Never.  I'll see it CW with a fucking half a winky face.  Never.  Fucking boo.  The truth of the matter is, I usually just put A-P-T, period.  The apt.  That's good.  I can accept that.  Yeah.  Oh, that's all right.  I like you again.  I don't really. 
[01:36:00]  I don't really call it the Compound West.  I like you again.  When are you there?  Are you there ever?  You know, no one ever knows, really.  When I stay in the city, it's like I'm like Batman.  Yeah.  When I'm in the city, and I'm going to be hanging out, and it's going to be a chore for me to  drive home, and by chore, I mean I'm drunk, or it's going to be a chore for me to drive  back to work the next day, which by chore, I mean hungover.  I stay in the city.  It's so much easier.  I get to sleep in another half hour, because I don't have to drive. 
[01:36:30]  Kenny comes and picks me up.  Hello, Anthony.  It's like your cabin in the woods.  Yeah, yeah, only it's in the middle of Manhattan.  It's wonderful.  Is Bill Burr coming in today, too?  So I hear.  Any minute?  All right, good.  Bill Burr.  What do you got going on, Joe?  Anything?  I got those Caroline shows coming up, but I'm going to, actually, Minnesota.  I'm going to be in Minnesota at the House of Comedy this weekend.  No, I meant like just, what do you got going on in your world?  That's all I got, Ope.  I got nothing except the work at this point. 
[01:37:00]  Nothing.  I'm trying to...  Actually, I'll go with the Minnesota thing.  How is Minnesota?  I've never been there.  It seems like a great place to live.  It's cold as balls, but you guys got a lot of followers out there.  They embrace the cold up there.  Did I look during the game yesterday?  I saw people doing some of that cross-country skiing, and they seemed to enjoy it.  You know when they have to do little vignettes before they go back to the game?  I looked on weather.com to see, like, how I need to pack.  It's fucking 23 degrees every day.  Like, the peak highs are 23. 
[01:37:30]  So they're in the middle of winter, Ratty.  Yeah.  Middle of winter.  No, that's the beginning of winter for them.  Yeah, that's true.  It gets a lot colder.  I just turned down New Year's Eve there because the wet flying in, I'm too scared to fly in  because the weather there is too bad.  I love that.  There's a lot of fucking O&A fans in Minnesota.  He's right.  They put the skis on the plane or something?  I'm not flying in.  Yeah, I know.  It's like Minnesota, minute juice.  I don't know.  That's a good one, Chip.  Let's look at Minnesota on the map.  Is it one of those states that could be part of Canada?  Like, is it above Canada? 
[01:38:00]  You know what I mean?  No, no.  How some of Canada dips down into our fucking territory.  Gets some of the shit.  Yeah, close enough, though.  It's up there.  It's right up there.  Oh, boy.  Sam doesn't know where Minnesota is.  It's obvious.  He doesn't know.  See, he doesn't know where it is.  It's right next to North Dakota.  He has no idea.  He has no idea.  He's just saying the A.  Where's the A?  It's ridiculous.  And I was right.  Technically, it could be part of Canada because look at all that shit that dips down from Canada  to the east. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Canada's cock dips right down into fucking Ohio.  Canada really could have taken, like, yeah, Michigan and Wisconsin and just taken it  and given us, like, just a big swoop there with no Great Lakes or nothing.  We wouldn't miss North Dakota, I don't think.  They really did it right with the states in Canada, how they just chopped it up into those  fucking six regions or whatever it is.  Just big, giant.  Good enough, hey?  This is good enough.  They just stopped.  Yeah. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, they don't need, like, hours to cut up in nice, small little states.  They didn't know where to stop.  How come there's no white stuff falling there in July?  I don't want to go there.  That looks like things actually grow.  Bums.  I didn't realize Minnesota was that much further north than, like, Buffalo.  And Buffalo's cold as balls.  You know what?  I got to be honest.  Holy shit.  I didn't know it was that north.  I didn't know where it was.  I'm just terrible at geography.  I didn't know it was that far north either.  I would have moved Minnesota a little east of what it is now. 
[01:39:30]  Really?  That's where I thought it was.  And, oh, wow.  I thought it was a little further east than that.  A little south.  A little south, to be honest with you.  And I would have went a little south.  A little south?  Yeah, I would have went.  If we're going to be honest with you guys.  Yeah.  I would have went a little south.  I would have said it was, like, kind of parallel to Buffalo.  Maybe just north of Buffalo.  Everyone knows it's fucking freezing.  It's further north than Maine.  I know.  It's way the fuck up there.  The club I'm at is inside the Mall of America.  Is that mall cool?  Well, look.  It's big. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  As far as malls goes, it's great.  I would never tell somebody, like, you got to make a point in your life to go to the  Mall of America.  It's a mall.  Because it has the same shit every other mall has.  It's just a lot bigger.  It's just gigantic.  And there's a roller coaster.  In the mall?  I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Inside.  Ice skating, right, too, I think?  Yeah.  There's a bunch of activities underneath their roof because it gets very cold there and people  are able to go to this mall and kind of, you know, be warm.  Yeah.  It's like a great, it's like a dream, to me at least, it's like a dream road gig because  you can, you have something, you can go to the mall and, like, walk around and not 
[01:40:30]  feel, like, fucking lonely.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm just laughing at...  What is that?  What is the Hulk sound?  It's not there anymore, but the Mall of America was once home to Hulk Hogan's Pasta Mania.  Oh, Jesus.  Is everything after Mania?  It's just pasta.  Pasta Mania.  So his restaurant business failed, too, huh?  Oh, Pasta Mania, like Hulkamania.  Pasta Mania, brother.  What terrible is that?  What did they just throw the spaghetti at?  What do you want, Roachini?  Right. 
[01:41:00]  This is America's gnocchi, brother.  Oh, my God.  Look at that pasta.  Thanks for me.  Yeah.  And the first Nitro in the Mall of America, and the whole thing was just an advertisement  for Hulk Hogan's Pasta Mania.  Oh, God.  They did the wrestling show inside the Mall of America, and the great train store was  ringside, and it was all just a commercial for Pasta Mania.  What a fucking shill.  How long did it last?  And Pasta Mania?  And what did you get at Pasta Mania? 
[01:41:30]  I would love to see their menu.  Sauce.  Everything had mania.  They're wearing wigs out of pasta, like, long, straight hair.  Like, Hulk hair pasta.  Yeah, yeah.  It's pasta.  Very wispy.  Well, I like the pasta in heaven.  That's a really small portion that you just throw on the floor.  Yeah, I bet it had a...  Yeah, everything probably had a wrestling...  Yes, wrestling.  Turnbuckle, tortellini, stupid shit like that.  Oh, God.  Big boot macaroni.  Fucking sucks.  I've never in my life gone from such, like, revered, like, just loving somebody to, like, 
[01:42:00]  being like, I fucking hate him.  You hate the Hulkster?  I hate the Hulkster.  Why, man?  He's down on his block.  He's a dick.  And that's one of V-Rock's heroes still.  He really is a dick.  V-Rock, is he still on your hero list?  Look, I don't hate him like Joe does, but my appreciation of him has sunk.  Oh, come on!  God, all your heroes have let you down.  I know.  Everyone of us is the only one.  Once the reality show came out, and he was, like, introspective Hogan, where he'd sit 
[01:42:30]  there with his kid and be like, let me tell you something, brother.  Brother, even though it's a dick.  When you eat lunch, when you feel that full feed, and you stop eating, man, and this is  how you get rid...  It's like, shut up and scream America at somebody and get the fuck out of my face.  He just is the worst.  I don't think I ever liked Hulk as a wrestler.  Do you like him, Jim?  No.  I don't think I ever liked him as a wrestler, man.  I liked him in Rocky III.  Go fuck himself after that.  Yeah.  He's thunder lips.  Yeah.  But, Opie, you liked him when he was driving by his old house on his boat. 
[01:43:00]  I howled.  What did I tell recently?  And they were horrified that I was howling at that.  I think CM Punk.  CM Punk was like...  Even CM Punk's looking at me like, what the fuck?  Why do you think that's funny?  I'm like, it's the...  Could you find that scene for Joe DeRosa so we could all laugh?  So he loses his waterfront mansion to his ex-wife there.  And he visits the mansion on the water.  But he's not allowed to touch the shore or he's in violation of the court order. 
[01:43:30]  And his dogs come running up right up to the boat, but he can't touch them.  Can't touch my dogs, brother.  You've never seen this?  This makes me fucking howl.  This is one of my go-to clips.  This is an ad.  Huh?  Ad.  This is it, though, right?  Uh, yeah.  We haven't played this in a while.  The dogs are barking like, come on, dad.  I've never seen this.  Oh, this makes me howl.  I've never seen this.  Actually, it makes blows.  It's still advertising.  Is this the Angry Birds?  Yeah.  Oh.  The dogs just thought Dad was coming home.  Why did Angry Birds seasons not do a Thanksgiving one? 
[01:44:00]  They went from Halloween to Christmas.  I'm confused by that.  They felt they didn't want to celebrate the holiday.  I fantasy.  I don't know.  I mean, if you want to put genocide into a video game.  Yeah, that's true.  Have you played Angry Birds lately with the big orange?  The new bird?  The stupid orange?  No, I haven't been playing that.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  I've been a man playing Call of Duty.  True.  Oh.  Here it is.  Here it is.  I pause this.  Pause this.  It needs a setup.  Who is that?  That's Brooke. 
[01:44:30]  It's his daughter.  I just fucking run.  Listen to your laugh.  Oh, it's great.  Because it's so ridiculous.  I'm actually at Hulk's side on this whole thing,  but it just shows you how the judicial system is so ridiculous.  He fucking bought that house.  Not his wife.  It's his money.  Look, yeah.  Yeah.  And it got so bad that he could only visit his old mansion on the water with his crying daughter.  I love that his daughter's with him, though,  because they broke up because he fucked her friend, didn't she?  I thought you were going to say, uh...  No, come on. 
[01:45:00]  Let's keep it above the belt in here today, please.  Thank God we don't have to fucking make believe we like her music anymore.  Thank God.  But he fucked her friend, right?  It wasn't bad.  Yeah.  Apparently.  I guess.  We don't know.  Yeah, I think so.  I think that is.  I think you didn't get into it.  All right.  Here it is.  The tiny little boat, because he can only afford a small boat now,  is idling outside the waterfront mansion.  It's not a yacht.  He got it from Renner Center.  Let me tell you, brother, you need a boat at Renner Center. 
[01:45:30]  Hey, junkyard dog, can I borrow your boat?  Junkyard dog is dead.  Yeah, don't bring him down.  Oh, Jesus.  VH1 probably gave him the boat.  I was going to say Macho Man.  I was like, oh, he's dead, too.  I couldn't think of a wrestler.  Bill Baer.  Bill Baer.  Bill Baer is here.  All right.  Show Joe DeRosa this clip as Bill gets comfortable.  Yeah, this is a holster.  This makes me a holster.  I've been 20 years destroying my body to build that house.  This is some kid that's 19 years old who lives in that house.  Fucking your wife. 
[01:46:00]  Look how sick this house is.  Montage of how sick the house is.  I miss you.  Looks like an Applebee's.  What does she do?  I'm going to get over there.  Is she okay?  Yeah, I'm okay.  I was thinking about Colin Brooke.  I heard she was here in town.  She's visiting her dad, and she hasn't called me.  I'm just a little bit freaked out by that.  I really wish she could sit down and take the time to meet you and I together.  Yeah.  When do I get to see you?  When are you coming back?  She got a young Hulk.  I bought you a surfboard up here, too, by the way. 
[01:46:30]  You did?  Are you serious?  You're such a cutie pie.  Oh, she's trying to act young.  Shut up.  All right, baby.  I'll see you in a few days.  Be safe, okay?  She's in the beautiful mansion.  That Hulk ball.  That Hulk broke every bone in his body.  I did.  Bye.  I'm going to go back to that Hulk who's on the water.  Here he is.  Back to the Hulk.  The Hulk isn't even allowed in there.  I can't pet Cookie.  Brooke, I can't pull in there, otherwise your mom will have me put in jail.  I can't.  I can't pull up there.  I just want to touch her for a second.  He's feeling the aches and pains that it took to buy that house. 
[01:47:00]  Molly, my love.  Dude, he's three inches short.  Yeah, yeah.  From all those years.  Look at Molly.  Look, they can only just look at the old dogs.  And now he's not crying.  And now Hulk's crying.  Oh, wait, that's Brooke.  Oh, she's crying, Dad.  I hate this.  She's crying, brother.  I was just going to say that.  I'm going to kill your mother, brother.  They're all crying.  That's great. 
[01:47:30]  With their Ed Hardy boxers.  Fucking.  Oh, God.  Just weeping by the house.  Is that the brother or the boyfriend?  Everyone's the brother, brother.  Yeah, that's not so awful, man.  That's not her brother.  Oh, good voice.  But it's bullshit because they filmed it for TV because she could have fucking petted her old dogs.  Yeah, of course.  But they had to make it even more dramatic.  Restraining order?  Yeah, and he's not going to.  The daughter isn't allowed to touch the dog?  Get the fuck out of here. 
[01:48:00]  And what's he going to get thrown in jail for?  He didn't beat his wife around.  He just cheated on her.  Who gets a restraining order for cheating?  I don't know.  Well, if she has a house and he gets on that land, that's trespassing.  I don't know.  Really?  I don't know how it works.  I just know everything in divorce sucks dick.  And it's all about the guy getting screwed.  Someone just said.  Who has more money?  Hold on.  Someone just sent me an article.  The guy.  The guy.  Someone sent me an article that Linda McMahon got 70%.  Of what?  In the divorce. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Linda McMahon.  What?  I mean.  Stephanie?  Oh, okay.  You got me flustered.  Linda Hogan.  Sorry.  Oh, okay.  I'm there going.  Wait a minute.  When did that happen?  70%.  She got 70%.  This guy just sent me the article.  There's no fucking way to actually do the math there.  How does she get that much money?  It says so much for 50-50.  Linda received more than 70% of the couple's liquid assets.  But the pain doesn't stop there for the Hulkster.  His ex also received a 40% ownership stake in Hulk's companies. 
[01:49:00]  Plus, she receives a $3 million property settlement.  Oh.  How does he not kill her?  Fucking ridiculous.  What did she do to earn that?  Nothing.  She spread her legs like a fucking whore.  But he must have had a shitty lawyer.  He got to fuck.  Sounds like he tapped out.  Sounds like he said, look, I just want it to be over, brother.  Yeah.  I know guys get fucked in divorce cases, but he must have had a shitty lawyer on top.  He hired Colin Ferguson.  That would be great.  What a lawyer. 
[01:49:30]  She got a lump sum of $7.44 million from the couple's investment account.  Come on.  The remaining $2.97.  It's over the top.  So listen to this.  She got $7.44 million of the investment accounts, and he got $2.97 million.  How is that fucking possible?  That isn't even fucking right.  He made all that money.  Ridiculous.  You know what's great is to bring shit up like that while you're doing stand-up, and  as you're doing it, you hear the women in the crowd go, that's right.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, don't ever do it, because the hatred you'll have for women will go through the fucking 
[01:50:00]  roof.  No fucking embarrassment from it.  Yeah.  How do you not just yell cunt at that point?  Yeah.  They're not embarrassed or anything.  I was on a date with somebody, and something, you know, they'd flip it around, and I was  with someone going, that's right.  That's right.  I'd be like, okay, thank you.  Thank you for that lock-the-door test.  Right.  Fucking work.  Yeah, they just fucking...  That's the thing with women in the audience a lot.  It's like, you'll talk about shit.  Like, I have a bit about women aging, and I talk about it, and I'm like, yeah, you age. 
[01:50:30]  You have an idea, Joe.  Let's be honest.  You age.  That's something you present.  An idea.  Before you give us your little stand-up comedy class.  I'm not going to do the thing.  It's like that time when I was down in the Elks Club.  Bill, I wish we could just hang out for once and just be pals.  Come on, Joe.  You know this is the way we show affection.  That's so funny.  I got a bit.  He got an idea.  You yell it.  And you fucking cunts, you all just turn immediately.  It's so funny. 
[01:51:00]  I'm hanging in there.  Thank you.  Yeah, I do want to hear this.  Opie looks like he's preparing for some Oscar-winning role over there.  Look at that castaway beard.  What's going on with you?  That's my horrible beard.  I like it.  You look at a little distinguished...  Greg Opie Hughes as Ernest Hemingway.  He became Ernest.  Yes.  He wanted to be called Ernest.  Opie Hanks.  He's always in character. 
[01:51:30]  As long as he's got the beard.  It's not staying.  If you need to know, it started with the whole Patrice thing a while ago.  Oh, it was a beard of woe.  A beard of woe.  Well, it started with, like, I just stopped shaving.  Yeah.  Why would you care when something like that...  I have my beard of woe.  Wait, Opie's on TV.  If you need to know the real answer.  Oh, yeah.  Richard Branson.  Richard Branson.  What are you, an adventurer?  That's the real answer. 
[01:52:00]  Let's host a show from a hot air balloon.  Yeah.  Right.  Proud to announce Opie Airlines premiering this week.  Fuck a wish.  Doug, where's your idea?  Let's go.  It's...  I'm not going to...  Well played.  What?  Well played.  You got it right off.  I'm sure I'll get it.  There's plenty of beard junk that's coming my way.  I just got to speak to Bill's point about chicks ragged in the crown.  I do a joke about how women age worse than we do, and then women always get a joke.  I'm not going to do the bit.  Joe, I just don't like you saying. 
[01:52:30]  I'm going to speak to Bill's point like you're two congressmen debating.  I was trying to tap dance my way out of a trashing.  It didn't work.  What is your stance here, Joe?  The chair recognizes William Burr.  So, but it's women get mad at it.  It's like, I'm taught...  This bit is written because of shit that women say.  I'm not just up here being...  So, it's just...  They just...  Like you're making the shit up.  No, Joe, don't give up.  Yeah, they just want to be...  My point is they just want to run their fucking mouths. 
[01:53:00]  And they're lippy, and I don't like it.  I think they need to learn their place.  I got to say, I saw both you guys at Carnegie.  It was obviously Bill Burr's show, but Joe, you're fucking killed.  And speaking of women aging, Bill Burr's material on plastic surgery.  Holy fuck did that have...  I was howling.  Oh, thanks.  I don't want you to do it.  I'm just giving you a compliment.  Well, I could never follow Joe's awful material.  Your fucking...  Your new shit, especially on the plastic surgery, that had me fucking howling, man. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, thank you.  The Carnegie Hall dug it.  You had a great...  Thank you.  I...  You had a great show there.  I wouldn't have been there without this show.  You had a great show.  That's true, man.  That's all...  This whole area.  Right.  I sold nothing until I got on this show.  I sold nothing.  Nothing.  I was doing...  And I just listened to you last night.  You did a podcast on Black Friday.  That was really fucking funny.  Oh, those fucking idiots.  Just go there on Tuesday and buy less. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Go in like a gentleman and just be like, I'll take one of those in that color.  Why would you get involved in that?  They don't have the sale on Tuesday.  They do have the sale.  The prices don't change.  Yeah, but you...  This year, especially, they started the Black Friday deals way before Black Friday.  Yeah, but Joe, I'm saying, you obviously can't afford it.  If you have to really put yourself...  Ah.  You're fucking health at risk.  I disagree with that a little bit.  To go buy a foreman grill, Joe?  Really?  Why don't you just...  Do you think that by buying that, you're now going to be rich? 
[01:54:30]  I went to one at midnight.  I hate how you already knew what you were going to say.  Yeah, I did.  And you didn't listen to the rest of that.  Wait, you didn't listen to a word.  Turned out completely.  You did Black Friday, Joe?  I went at midnight, like Thanksgiving night.  Oh, my God.  I came to look at you.  I had nothing to do.  So you went to Walmart?  No, you went to Walmart.  I went to the Joe Jeans outlet.  I got a bunch of pairs of Joe Jeans for like 60 bucks each.  You couldn't fucking beat it.  You're in the show business, Joe.  I'm not at the level where I get free shit yet.  But I wouldn't have money if you could have got those jeans on Tuesday. 
[01:55:00]  I think Bill Burr's right.  I was bored.  Joe becomes an icon.  He'll be one of those people who goes in for the voiceover and is stealing mints.  You tight fuck.  Is Joe a chiseler?  Totally.  No, no, no, no, no.  Joe thinks it's all going to go away at any second.  I'm not a chiseler, but I do enjoy a deal.  I'm not going to lie.  I'm like a nice bargain when I find one.  I won't bargain hunt, but if I find one, I get genuinely excited.  Did you fight the crowds for your jeans?  No, it was empty. 
[01:55:30]  But you had to go at midnight?  Dude, I was literally sitting on my mom and dad's couch at midnight on Thanksgiving.  I was wired.  I had nothing to do.  And they lived by these outlets.  I was like, I'm just going to go over and see what it's all about.  And I went over.  He planned his entire fucking visit for his parents around this goddamn sale.  I was trying to make it sound logical.  You couldn't wait.  I was wired.  When I'm wired at 12, you know, I'll jerk off.  I'll make a sandwich.  I'll make a sandwich.  Not go to the store.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  John Jones is making his way down the hall.  He's here early.  What?  John Jones, man. 
[01:56:00]  He's the UFC champion.  He's the fucking man these days.  Yeah.  But you got to get Joe in the seat.  He's early.  Do we have to break for live reads, or are we good?  I think we're good.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Oh, Joe's getting the fucking ejector seat.  No, get Joe another.  How much are those sneakers, Joe?  Did you get those down there, too?  Here, Joseph.  Take your coat.  Yeah, beat it.  Bill is surly today.  Take your coat and your breakfast and beat it.  Just beat it.  Joe, I don't like pontification. 
[01:56:30]  Really?  Did you ever listen to your own act?  Oh, hey.  Joey DeRose.  Joey DeRose.  Jody.  Hi, Joe.  I want to see if that mic's on.  Joe, were you talking to that real fast?  Oh, sorry.  Yes, yes.  Hello.  Okay, I got you.  Is it on?  Holy shit.  John Jones is in the studio.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Pleasure.  It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.  He's in fighting shape.  Obi and Anthony.  What's up, man?  Fuck that.  John Jones, man.  Uh-uh.  You are.  We became instant fans of yours. 
[01:57:00]  Instant.  Which fight was it?  Shogun fight?  Which one was it?  It was before Shogun, I think.  It was before Shogun.  And we wound in here badly.  I was at the Shogun fight.  That was...  In a jersey person?  I was sitting behind his family.  Oh, poor guy.  Yeah, they were not happy.  There was guys...  These tough Brazilian guys who were part of his crew and his family, and they were weeping.  Like, there was...  Wow, really?  They couldn't believe you...  Yeah, because he really beat up Shogun.  Yeah, yeah.  That was funny.  I was actually nervous to go to Brazil because of that. 
[01:57:30]  You know, he's like a hero over there.  You know, like an icon.  I was like, I don't know if I'm quite welcome there yet.  Oh, man.  Beat up there, Elvis.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't even a close fight.  Like, maybe for the first few minutes of the first round.  But I watched it again yesterday.  Oh, humiliating.  Humiliating.  To lose your belt like that.  Like, if you lose your belt, you want it to go out maybe in the fifth round.  Not like that.  We're not talking about losing belts.  Dude.  All right.  Yeah, you're fighting next week.  I'm sure you'll be fine.  Rashida.  Yeah. 
[01:58:00]  I'm excited, man.  Lioto's a tough, tough dude.  Were you supposed to fight Rampage, but he's hurt and you can't?  No, I fought Rampage.  I'm sorry.  I mean Rashad.  Rashad Evans.  Yeah, me and Rashad, we've both had injuries.  And the fight's just not panning out to happen so far.  But it'll happen.  I'm sure right after this Lioto fight, it'll be either Rashad Evans.  That's a fight everyone wants to see.  Yeah.  John Jones or Rashad Evans?  Holy shit.  They're calling that the Ali Frazier of our sport.  You know, that comparison of just the hype that's behind it.  You had no problem with Rampage. 
[01:58:30]  Were you surprised by that at all?  You know, I was very confident in my game plan.  I knew that my best chances of losing the fight was to stand in the pocket with him.  The guy has devastated knockout power, left hand and right hand.  He can hit any angle.  So, you know, I knew if I stayed out of the pocket and used my longest range weapon, which  is my leg kicks and my push kicks and things, that I'd be fine.  So I was confident, but I didn't know it was going to go like that.  I mean, he actually only hit me one time throughout the whole fight.  Yeah.  Which is nuts. 
[01:59:00]  Is there ever a moment in a fight like that where you're like, do you know you're going  to win?  Or is that sport just so crazy that you can't even allow yourself to think that?  Yeah.  You can't even allow yourself to think that.  I mean, one.  This is going great.  Right?  You're just down.  Yeah.  No way.  You got to be on point at all times of the fight.  You know, crazy thing with me.  I think I have ADD.  So just keeping that level of concentration and focus.  He started looking at people in the crowd.  For 25 rounds.  Yeah.  I'm like, when is this going to be over?  You know?  I'm not going to have ADD. 
[01:59:30]  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  He gave it up to you too.  Rampage.  He never does that.  He's like, this guy's the real deal.  He's great.  Like when he was talking at the end, he really praised you.  Yeah.  It was nuts because before the fight, you know, Rampage, he kept making fun of me.  He had a thousand different names to call me.  Every media outlet we did, you know, he was downing me.  Me and down on my game, down on my coaching staff.  So I was like, you know, kind of, I'm really starting to hate this guy, you know?  And so after the fight, there was a photographer caught a picture with my foot literally inside of his mouth. 
[02:00:00]  And I was like, you know what?  You know, I just want to, it was just so iconic, you know?  But because, because he was so respectful right after the fight and gave me the props that I deserve, you know, he, I, I decided not to make that, the display picture on my Twitter page.  Does that go into making you want to hit a guy more, like, or does it mess you up?  Like, because Ali would get in people's heads and then they couldn't fight him because they were so mad.  If a guy is just shit talking you, does it, does it, does it kind of put so much anger in you that it could throw you off? 
[02:00:30]  You know, it, it doesn't not, it doesn't work for me like that.  You know, I try to keep it more about the competition.  You know, let's, let's save all the trash talk and let's see who's the better athlete and the better combatant.  But with Rampage, you know, he just kept insulting me so much.  It, it didn't cloud my mind or, or throw me off, but I just, it made me want to finish the fight more.  You know, I didn't want the fight to go to decision.  I wanted to try to knock him out or embarrass him.  And that picture was pretty embarrassing. 
[02:01:00]  I didn't see the photo.  Yeah.  That's because I never put it up because he was respectful after the fight.  So I said, you know what, let's shake hands and walk our separate ways like, man, yeah, I'll let you slide in that one.  I'm trying to think how to ask this question without you giving up any sort of secret, but what is the most, like, I don't know, what hurts the most?  The elbows.  Whenever I watch that, I always think for some reason, just laying on the ground, that ground and pound, somebody just dropping those elbows.  Yeah, yeah, that's my signature, the ground and pound.  Yeah, every time I get my opponent down and start raining elbows down on him, you know, when he gets back to his feet, he just doesn't seem the same. 
[02:01:30]  It takes a lot of people's will.  Yeah, what level of training can you do where you can handle that Charlie horse kick at Olympic level more?  And I can't believe you guys are going to still stand up.  I was in a cab yesterday and Bobby punched me in the leg and I limped into the restroom.  That's Bobby just sitting there, half a jab.  Some traditional martial artists, they do body conditioning, and that's where they literally take turns kicking each other in the legs.  And they do these drills where they bang their forearms together. 
[02:02:00]  And after a while, your body starts to harden and, you know, not be susceptible to damage.  You know, I haven't taken things that far.  I just really get out of the way.  So there is ways to condition yourself, but I don't think it's very common right now.  I can't imagine.  Yeah.  Well, my shins are pretty conditioned.  It's unbelievable.  Your elbows are, that's the worst thing in MMA is his elbows.  There was one, you hit Shogun and I think you spun around and hit him with a left elbow in the face.  Yeah.  You're impossible to figure out because big guys, when you get in on a tall guy, at least his reach can't be used. 
[02:02:30]  But you just put your knees and elbows in the guy's face.  And we talked about that move on our show and your arms are so long.  Like, I swear to God, it almost looked like it was a fist and it was his elbow coming around.  Right.  Remember that?  Yeah, I love it.  See, I found myself being at a disadvantage whenever guys are too close to me because they have an 84.5 inch reach.  The same leech as Lennox Lewis.  So, you know, I had to figure out what am I going to do to defend myself when these guys are all up on my grill.  Right. 
[02:03:00]  So, I started working tons of Muay Thai, tons of knees, tons of elbows, and more importantly, tons of takedowns from the clinch.  And, yeah, it's become a good defense and offense.  Short range.  It seems like there's no good way to approach you from a fighter's point of view because the closer you get, the more likely you are to take a knee in the face.  And that's just a horrible, horrible place to be.  I'm glad it appears that way.  Yeah, it really does.  It's fighting.  We love how you fight.  It's exciting.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah, it's unpredictable.  It really is.  Everything people think you're going to do, you don't. 
[02:03:30]  Again, in the Shogun fight, there was one as you went for a leg lock, and then he's laying on the back, and he just hammer-fisted him in the face.  Ah, how embarrassing.  Yeah.  The least expected.  It's hard to block.  Yeah, yeah.  It seems like you train like that, or is that just your natural instinct in fighting?  A lot of it's training, and then a lot of it's just having an open mind and creativity.  You know, I'm always meditating on fighting and thinking about new openings.  And, you know, I think I'm a really big student of myself.  You know, I watch my own fights a lot, and I realize, man, you know, if I had more awareness, maybe I can add that in there, or do that next time, and do that next time. 
[02:04:00]  And, you know, I take that mindset, and I bring it to the gym, and I start working all the things that I could have done.  And then once you get to the fight, you know, you just find yourself way more openings and way more ideals, and you just start doing all types of creative things out there.  When was the last time somebody didn't know who you were, just like a civilian, and started giving you shit?  And what do you think during that moment?  You know what?  That's funny.  That doesn't happen too often. 
[02:04:30]  You know, whenever I'm out, you know, I'm usually out with a few buddies, and I'm always, like, one of the more fit guys around, and I always have a smile on my face.  So, you know, people want to start with me.  It's just rare.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, I would have shown.  The smile diffuses.  That would be the greatest YouTube video ever.  Oh, no kidding.  What's up, buddy?  What's up?  Fucker, you fucking dog.  Get off me.  Get off me.  There he goes.  Yeah.  That's what guys like us fantasize about.  It's like, if we were like that, like, the moment the guy said something, we're like, 
[02:05:00]  excuse me?  Right.  Like, I would be reacting like I react as a nerd now.  Yeah.  That's just not the way you carry yourself when you can fight, I think.  I know.  When was the last time you were afraid walking home?  Fucking superhero.  You're a hero.  Yeah.  It's funny because I train in Albuquerque, and me and about five of my teammates that  trained at Jackson's MMA were out downtown one night, and a guy was getting jumped.  He provoked the whole fight, but he was getting jumped by a group of guys. 
[02:05:30]  So it was about five against one, and it was me and my five buddies that were out, you  know, and we were watching this happen, and one of my teammates was like, yo, let's  get over there.  You know, let's go get him.  You know, let's go stand up for that guy.  I'm like, well, first you got to realize all these guys are drunk, and the guy that's  getting jumped tried to take on five guys, so this is his own problem in a way.  And I was like, could you imagine a YouTube video with us pro fighters?  It looked like the Power Rangers, like, beating up these idiots, you know?  I'm like, dude, come on. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, you got to let that guy learn his lesson.  Yeah, well, the police came before we know it, and it wasn't that too bad.  He actually fought them all off.  He did all right.  Dude, like, we're doing spinning crescent kicks.  Who are these guys?  Guys just windmilling at you, trying to get a punch in.  So you have no temptation to step in?  Like, if you saw, I always thought, like, what would I do?  And build a funny bit on it.  You see, like, a domestic violence episode or whatever.  What would you do?  And it's like you want to help, but it's scary to think it would be turned on you.  Would you jump in? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, well, the last time I stood up so well and used my martial arts was the day of my title fight in Patterson, New Jersey.  You know, me and my coaches, we're meditating at a park in Patterson, and we hear a couple screaming, run over to the scene.  And there's an old couple with their windows busted out.  They're standing next to their car crying, and they said they had just been robbed.  So me and my coaches, we catch the telling of this guy.  And we chase them down, you know, and me being probably in the best shape, getting ready to fight, you know, four hours later. 
[02:07:00]  I catch up to the guy first, and then I late kick him and take him down and hold him until my coaches come.  And we all subdue this guy, and the Patterson police, they come, and they arrest the guy.  And we get this woman, what happens to be her GPS system back.  And she was just so grateful.  You know, it was all over TMZ.  He's got to still be telling that story.  All right, two old people, easy target.  Easy fucking target.  I don't fucking know where this goddamn superhero shows up.  Wrong time, wrong place, man. 
[02:07:30]  I love it.  This whole body fell like an elbow.  I love that fighting is so second-hand, or first-hand, that you're just like, yeah, the day of the fight, I just got into another quick fight.  If I kicked somebody, I'd be down for a month.  I'd be like, that's it for me.  And you just, whatever.  It's just like small, you know, it's business as usual.  Day at the office.  I mean, we all have our niche, and fighting's what I do best.  But, you know, it was cool, you know, to use, like, my gift in a positive light like that, and to show people that, you know, mixed martial arts not only builds character, but, you know, you can, you know, it's just so much greatness. 
[02:08:00]  You're not the Cobra Kai.  Yeah.  You're the friendly dojo.  How silly is it, this misconception that it's so violent when the fights, no way MMA fighters take the abuse boxers do, because you're not getting punched for 12 rounds.  No way.  And you're going to make a lot of boxers upset out there to hear, but it's just true, you know, it's factual.  MMA is actually one of the safest sports you can play.  You know, you got football players, you got these 230-pound men running as fast as they can and clashing into each other. 
[02:08:30]  You got the linemen, you know, blasting each other off the whistle, play-by-play.  Those guys get tons of concussions.  You guys, you got, what, boxers.  You know, boxers, you know, the primary goal is to knock each other's heads off, right, round after round.  You get knocked down, you get an eight-count, you stand back up and you get another concussion.  You know, these sports are pretty dangerous, you know.  So, you know, I'm a champion, and out of my last four fights, I've been hit about five times in the face total, which is a nuts statistic. 
[02:09:00]  And, you know, a lot of times fights are won by leg kicks or submission.  There's an honorable way to just say I've had enough by tapping out, you know.  So, I guess it looks brutal because of the blood and the ground and pound and everything.  Common injuries we go home with is maybe a cut over the eye or a black eye or maybe some bruised ribs or anything.  But, I mean, it's not nearly as dangerous as a lot of these sports.  The only one that looks crazy is after the dude's knocked out and you guys are so quick that you get those other 17 in is that rep is running all the way up. 
[02:09:30]  No!  17.  Really?  I'm just saying.  Really?  I'm just, you know what it is, I put myself into who I would be in the fight, and it's always the loser.  So, I always see myself laying there going, stop, stop it!  Yeah, hoping someone would get there in time, right?  And you just see your job opportunities going down, like manager of a restaurant, waiter, busboy, eating out of the dumpster.  Please, get to this guy.  That's funny.  You know what?  A lot of times the fans are so upset because they feel as if fights are being stopped way too fast. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  You know, the referees, they're aware.  You know, they know our backgrounds.  They know our stories.  And they also know that our wives are sitting on the front row.  So, you know, they stop the fights pretty fast.  Do you ever get annoyed when some crowd, when there's really some strategy going on, when it's down on the ground and they start booing?  Does that ever bother you?  Yeah.  You just want to stop fighting and be like, do you understand what the fuck I'm doing down here?  Don't start an arm bar here, you assholes.  This is important too, right?  You know, that's the biggest difference between the Pride organization and the UFC. 
[02:10:30]  You know, Pride originated in Japan, and the Japanese fan base, they had so much more respect for every aspect of martial arts.  You know, they really carried that martial arts demeanor and energy with them.  You know, UFC fans are a little bit more about the kickboxing, the big knockout.  They just want to see some blood and some knockouts.  America.  Yeah, they don't want to see two guys, you know, rolling around on the mat.  Right.  So, you know, the UFC fans, they're really starting to pick up and realize that jiu-jitsu is a cultural thing. 
[02:11:00]  It's a thing that has lots of history.  And they're really starting to understand what guard passing is and full mount and all the different positions.  They're having, you know, a lot more respect for it nowadays.  So, it's not as bad as it used to be, but they're learning.  We're getting there.  And it's got to be said, youngest UFC champion, Jon Jones.  Were you 23?  24 now.  When you won, I mean.  You see this beard?  Oh, you look like a much more distinguished gentleman.  But no, when you won the belt, you were 23, I think, right?  I won the belt, yeah, I was 23.  Okay.  And you've only been fighting in the UFC, what, four or five months now? 
[02:11:30]  Actually, yeah.  My first martial arts class was four years ago.  Four years ago?  Yeah, which is nuts to me to think of how far I've been.  Who's the poor bastard locked up with you?  I'll take the new fish.  It was some kid from Boxborough, Massachusetts, and this kid had no clue what he was getting  into.  Right.  No, I mean, how long have you been in the UFC, though?  You know, just about two years. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, okay.  About two years.  Wow.  Been moving fast.  I'm so passionate about the sport.  How did you take martial arts for you?  Like, what did you do before that?  Were you fighting your whole life, like boxing or just?  No, actually, you know, I wrestled.  I wrestled in high school, and I wrestled in college two years at Iowa Central.  And, you know, after I graduated from school, I just had this void.  Like, I felt like I wasn't living fulfilled.  You know, I had to continue competing somehow.  So I ended up joining a jiu-jitsu school, got pretty good at jiu-jitsu.  My jiu-jitsu coach encouraged me to go with martial arts full speed ahead, and that's what 
[02:12:30]  I did.  And, you know, I just had this vision that I would be a champion one day, and I carried  myself like that, and I trained that way, and meditated on fighting, you know, study  fighting as much as possible.  And I found myself catching up to guys who have been doing it 12, 14 years.  I met you briefly, me and Bob Kelly, actually.  It was the very famous Frank Muir.  It was the Muir-Lesnar fight.  Oh, yeah.  And we were back.  We just said Reed Harris introduced us very briefly, and Bobby goes, that guy's going  to be a champion.  After we walked away, he goes, he's the best fighter.  Bobby knows shit.  Yeah, Bobby's really good.  He really knows his shit. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, he's not here today.  Intuitive.  Are you, you're from Rochester originally?  Yep, yep.  Inner city, Rochester.  When did you leave?  I moved from Rochester in 98.  Oh.  98.  I think I was about 10.  Oh, okay.  You've never had a garbage plate, then.  I have.  Nick Tahoe's?  Yeah, yeah.  I love garbage plates.  I try to explain the garbage plate to these guys.  Yeah, it's been years, though, man.  Honestly, it's been a long time.  I probably shouldn't be eating too many of those nowadays.  Yeah, no.  The Nick Tahoe garbage plate is legendary.  Oh, yeah.  It is just a slop of everything.  No, people, you haven't had one. 
[02:13:30]  No.  It's so hard to have discipline.  You know, it's like I try, I do, three days in a row I've done elliptical, and I'm like,  all right.  You can treat yourself, Jimmy.  Treat yourself.  Is there an applause button?  I know, right?  Yeah.  Three days in a row when I figured why not have dessert last night.  I don't know how you guys.  I talked to Jimmy.  He likes to treat himself.  I do.  He likes to treat himself.  By the way, he's a nice man, but what he did is he looked, and he just looked down at my  stomach real quick, and then looked back up and laughed at me.  Oh, three days.  I bet you he never treats himself, John Jones.  Yeah, when do you, we always ask fighters this, when do you binge? 
[02:14:00]  I mean, there has to be a time where you kind of let yourself go for a week, or do you?  Yeah, definitely.  Right after a fight, usually I take off about a solid month.  No training.  I try not to even watch a fight, and just maintain somewhat of a normal lifestyle.  I am 24, and all my friends are around that age, so their priorities are way different  than mine.  Responsibility levels are way different than mine, and sometimes it's just good to go back  to my hometown and just remind them that I'm still one of them, and hang out, play video  games for several hours with the guys, and just sit around and chill, and kick in, let 
[02:14:30]  them know that none of this has changed me.  When you start to train, how long do you train for a fight?  I train about three to four solid months of all nutrition, three times a day, four times  a day.  That's a lot.  It's taxing on the body, and on the mind, man, the pressure of knowing that if you were  to lose, everyone's going to have that on their DVR.  Yeah, how do you fight that?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  You know what I mean?  That's what really gets my butt out of bed in the morning.  Oh, it's some pressure.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  That's what's always blown my mind, is just sitting there training, and you just know there's  somebody else training to kick the shit out of you at, like, the highest level.  Yeah, it's way different than, like, you know, being on a basketball team, like, oh, we lost  the game tonight, you know, that sucked.  You lose the game, man, you're going to be hurt, or the embarrassment, the fear of being  exposed, I think that's really what it is.  And it's not a team, either, really.  Even though you have your crew, it's almost like stand-up.  Like, I always got jealous of people in bands, that if you went out and it wasn't going well,  at least you had three other guys there. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, we got to commiserate with.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you could always kind of go down, but yeah, it's totally on you, man.  All improv, man.  Jesus.  And you can't control, you know, you can't control what your opponent's going to do, you  know, reactions.  You got to control your own body, your own energy, and his, and it's just one big masterpiece.  And you fight only, what, two, maybe three times a year, right?  You know, I've actually fought four times a year.  Wow.  It's the first time in our sports history.  That's a lot, right?  That a champion's fought in three world titles, and, you know, three world titles in one year.  Wow. 
[02:16:00]  So, yeah, I've had a busy 2004.  Do you ever have a problem with the family of someone you beat down as you're walking out  of the ring?  Do they ever get, like, upset?  No, you know, I haven't had that issue yet.  UFC fighters are pretty down to earth and pretty cool, most of them, you know.  A lot of times, you know, you find the guys at the same after parties or sharing a drink,  and, hey, you know, man, you kicked my butt tonight, you know, good job, I'll come back  and get you next time type of thing.  So, there's very little animosity after a defeat.  You know, we all respect each other and know what we go through to get ready for a performance. 
[02:16:30]  How can you not respect a guy like that?  I wish I could be that respectful in defeat.  Yeah.  I wish I could be that respectful in victory.  If he kicked my ass, I'd go, oh, next time.  But if I won, I would be an arrogant prick.  Stink.  Smack you in the face.  Get away from me.  Send your wife over here.  Exactly like Mr. T in Rocky III.  No, because that's what I was thinking.  Hey, woman.  Hey, woman.  I was thinking that shit because, you know, when you're telling jokes on stage, you ever 
[02:17:00]  do that and you see the boyfriend start getting mad?  Oh, yeah.  But you literally beat down the boyfriend in front of his wife or girlfriend.  That's just a whole other level of complete domination.  So, I would figure that there would be some sort of animosity.  Give her a wink.  Did you like that?  Yeah.  He's not a real man.  He's a real man.  He's a unique.  Hey, Rashad and you had a history together, too, like of training together.  And everyone says that that's a pretty good matchup or harder for you than, say, fighting  a rampage or whatever.  And what is your situation with him? 
[02:17:30]  It's funny.  Yeah.  We haven't tried ever as we trained together for about a year.  You know, and we obviously had our falling out.  You know, he got injured and the UFC offered me the chance to step in his spot and challenge  the champion for his belt.  When he got injured, he said, listen, John, you're like a little brother to me.  There's no one I would rather see take my place for the belt, you know, challenge than  you.  You know, I believe that you're ready and that you're going to win this belt.  So, you know, best of luck to you.  Came to my dinner, you know, with my family and closest friends and gave me this spiel. 
[02:18:00]  And I said, OK, cool, man.  You know, and our friendship was tight.  You know, I had his blessing to go out there and win the world championship.  I don't think he expected me to win it, maybe.  And I actually won the championship.  And his tone changed pretty fast, saying, oh, if he was really my friend, he would have  never stepped in.  And I'm like, hey, listen, I'm a young man trying to pursue my dream.  And I had there's a job opening.  And you gave me the blessing to take this position.  And now that I'm doing so well at it, you know, now I became the enemy and I become  the traitor somehow. 
[02:18:30]  So, you know, for the people who follow the storylines pretty closely, they totally  understand that that's exactly what it was.  And so, you know, now he's doing all these interviews telling people that, you know,  because he trained with me, he can crack my code and he knows the best ways to beat me  and he's seen me quit in practice and he knows my openings and all this stuff.  But what he doesn't realize is that I've only been competing for four years.  Rashad's have been, he's been competing for, you know, eight years or maybe 10 years. 
[02:19:00]  So with the experience come many tendencies and my game is elevating by the month.  So I'm not the same fighter that he competed against when we were training against each  other.  And where he feels as if he knows my tendencies, I totally know his tendencies because of the  fact that not only do I have way more footage to study, but I've trained with him as well.  So I'm excited for when that fight takes place.  I'm more of the confident that, that, that I'll do exactly what, you know, that I've been  doing, you know, studying these opponents, knowing my enemy, knowing myself, not being naive 
[02:19:30]  thanks to my downfalls and weaknesses and just, uh, and just playing the game that I love.  Can you give us an Ali prediction?  What round?  What's it going to be?  You know, um, you know, I usually don't get predictions, but...  For Opie and Anthony, well, come on.  And you mean for Rashida for this Saturday?  Yeah, you know, exactly.  It's probably not smart to look past Leo.  No, that's what, Tyson look past Buster Douglas.  Big mistake.  You never want to look past him.  But at the same time, the Rashad Evans fight is inevitable. 
[02:20:00]  It has to happen.  The UFC fans want it, and it's going to happen.  So, um, obviously I'm not looking past Leo, um, but for the Rashad Evans fight, I'm definitely  predicting a knockout.  Um, and Leo, though, I would just say I'm going to go out there, have fun, play the game  that I love, and, uh, and do my best, like always.  By the way, did you see the great advice I just gave him?  That's all I would offer in training camp.  Hey, remember Tyson Douglas.  That's all I would have to say.  I offered you nothing.  Thank God.  You can be my hype man.  Yeah, go on.  Tyson Douglas. 
[02:20:30]  Douglas Tyson.  I just keep saying it different.  Mike and Buster.  Bring up one of the most famous fights that there's no way he doesn't know about.  I know.  It's just, there's no way that motivates any fighter anymore.  It's 25 years ago.  But, uh, I could see where it would be hard to look past one guy to another guy.  Do you think with you and Rashad, because we had him in and he didn't speak badly of you,  but, uh, is it harder to fight a guy who is a close friend?  Like, do you almost need something that makes you willing to, to go out and kick the shit 
[02:21:00]  out of him or him?  Yeah.  Well, the thing about me and Rashad is that, you know, we're not, we're not close friends  by any means anymore.  You know, there's been lots of words, uh, said between us and, uh, you know, I'm honestly,  I'm honestly kind of over it in a way.  You know, I just want to see the competition, you know, same thing with rampage.  There's so much talk going on.  I just want to see who's the better athlete now.  Um, but we're, it's safe to say that there, there's no friendship there at whatsoever.  So it'll be business as usual when we get in there.  I'm sure the first time he swings at me, uh, I'm like, okay, let's, uh, you know, 
[02:21:30]  let's do this.  Let's do this.  So would it be harder to do if you were still close?  It would be, it would be harder to do.  You know, I don't think the kickbacks on the expat would be very hard, uh, because I kickbox  my teammates all the time for practice.  Uh, but one thing I don't do in practice very often is ground upon my teammates, you know,  ground upon is always practice on a, on a big bag on the floor.  Right.  Uh, so, you know, I've, I've never elbowed a friend in the face and, uh, that part will  be hard, but you know, swinging, swinging for home runs on the feet, you know, that'll 
[02:22:00]  go a lot easier.  See, if I was Rashad, that would be a ploy I would do.  I would say nothing but nice things about you because it may, even though you would  maybe still win, it would make it harder for you.  Like on the ground, you'd like, you know, you remember that shit I said?  It was nice.  You're trying to make eye contact with them, make a little sense.  How's the family?  How's the family?  It's all right.  Yeah.  You have an elbow in the throat.  I was watching that too.  And it was, you were covering and you were allowed to do that in mixed martial arts, cover  the mouth.  Oh yeah.  So you can't breathe.  Yeah, that's old school.  Yeah.  You know, you can breathe through it, but, uh, it just deserves the breathing, your breathing 
[02:22:30]  pattern.  And it's just, it's a very uncomfortable feeling.  It kind of makes you feel like you're drowning under there a little bit.  And you're so constant.  I'm sure you're so concentrating on the fact like, I got to breathe.  I got to breathe.  That you're not really thinking about what you have to be doing.  Like throwing punches or getting the fuck out of there.  No way you're trying to focus on getting your breathing pattern back.  Well, he was on his back and you, you're so long that your legs are open.  It's like, it's hard to, to, to grab.  It's impossible to get John Jones off you.  And you had your hand over his face.  And when he finally got rid of that, you just put your elbow and the ref had to keep  saying, ah, on the face, not the neck, not the neck. 
[02:23:00]  Cause your elbow is kind of stopping his head.  It was terrible, terrible beating.  You make it sound so brutal.  No, but it wasn't, it was, it wasn't anything unnecessary.  It was just a beautiful thing.  People.  You ever watch those shows on people going to prison and that type of stuff?  They'll show inside like me.  Those shows are absolutely terrifying to me going, there's no fucking way I could survive  in there.  Do you, do you just watch those?  That's like a comedy.  Are you going to try to shake me?  Are you serious?  You and how many cellmates?  What are you going to do with that thing? 
[02:23:30]  Really?  I don't know.  We're talking like, what is it?  Oz?  Is that what the show called?  Oz, yeah.  No, I mean literally like on like a national geographic where they'll go into San Quentin and you just  see, you know, you just see these people, you know, some people having a good time in  there.  Some people not having such a good time.  Not so much.  Haven't really fell in with a gang or anything.  I was just wondering.  Was it a skinny redhead white guy?  I don't know.  I was joking on my podcast.  I would be exotic in prison.  That's awesome. 
[02:24:00]  I don't even try.  I just tie my shirt off at the waist and pick one guy and look like he'd kill everybody  else.  Hey, I take care of you.  Jesus.  I just realized I couldn't do it.  I don't know.  I'd fight you.  I think I'd just kill myself.  No, I got no.  I remember if I came out, I would attack a guard because I figured at the end of the  day, at least he's not going to rape me.  You know, I'll just take the beat down.  And you're guaranteed he's going to look the other way when you are getting raped.  Yeah.  That's true.  That's the asshole that hit me. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Fuck up.  Literally.  Fuck up.  They wouldn't rape you if you're exotic, though.  They would all try to woo you with desserts.  Just keep taking cigarettes.  See if I can buy my way out of it.  Come on, guys.  Come on.  I got some commissary here for you.  I went to San Quentin with Kenny when we were in San Francisco.  That's classic.  And they said that Liddell had been there not long before we were.  And they said the place went fucking berserk for him.  Oh, I got a lot.  Oh, just applauded and screamed.  Yeah, they all love these guys.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, my God.  He walks in with that mohawk.  They must have felt like they were in a movie, like they were going to take over the prison  or some shit.  I saw Chuck recently.  And, you know, Chuck is known for his mohawk.  That's his signature thing.  And he has a wife now.  Is he married?  She gelled it and curled it.  Oh, shit.  And it wasn't quite right.  Not quite that intimidating look.  Chuck, you know, I looked up to you.  Chuck, what is this currently?  Wasn't Bloodsport Chuck anymore?  It wasn't.  It wasn't. 
[02:25:30]  Chuck done Hollywood.  But I was a little disappointed.  He's so intimidating.  He's still my brother.  We've had him in here a few times.  All you guys are intimidating, obviously.  But Chuck Liddell takes the cake.  He fucking breathes like a bull.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's hard to get a reaction from him.  That's the nice man.  But you don't want to hear.  We hear he loves us.  But we don't know because he's never really shown any emotion.  But you don't want to hear Liddell going, come on, don't use those soaps.  She'll kill me.  Right, right.  Nobody wants to.  I know.  Exactly.  Come on, it's not worth it.  It's not worth it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, he deserves it, though. 
[02:26:00]  He's painted the road for guys like himself.  Hell yeah.  Yes.  So, you know what?  Wear what you want, Chuck.  There you go.  Yeah.  And if you want to curl your mohawk.  Diet pink if you want to.  No one's going to say it to his face.  Yeah.  Jimmy, I think maybe if you could take a little bump somehow, what do you think?  What we do is we do this thing where, like, I'm not a fighter.  I don't know how to say that.  Amazing.  I know.  I just, but I always have the guys.  We've had, well, they'll do something on me.  Like, we've had, Kane has done it. 
[02:26:30]  We've had Fedor.  A lot of Rashad put me in, like, some floor move.  I don't want to, like, Anderson kicked me lightly.  His hurt the most, I think, because it didn't hurt as much in the moment, but I had a  take for two hours, because I'm not used to being jostled.  You've done about 10 or 12 of this.  About 10 or 12 fighters.  A chokehold, something like that.  Do you have good health insurance?  I do, actually.  Okay.  After.  So I, uh.  It's a split-second thing.  Like, he taps within a split-second of these holds.  Oh, that's no fun.  Well, it was, uh. 
[02:27:00]  They all let me go very quickly, except Fedor did an arm thing on me, and he kept, uh.  Well, that was a translation problem.  He gave a little more.  No, he understood, because I tapped, and he laughed, and he smiled, and then he tightened up again.  And then he loosened it, and then he tightened up again.  Very unpleasant.  But the recommendation, people have been, like, uh, Twittering me.  What's the, what's the, it's D-A-R-C-E, how do you spell that?  Uh, the D'Arce?  Oh, the D'Arce.  The D'Arce, okay.  The D'Arce, yeah.  And what does that entail?  I don't know.  Well, let's see it.  All right, let's do it.  Well, what is it?  Really?  I'm actually not the best at the D'Arce choke.  What is your, what is your favorite choke?  Hmm, favorite choke. 
[02:27:30]  I was actually planning on spinning back-kicking you, definitely.  I really, I literally would be afraid that I would die, but I would love to take a punt.  I just couldn't do it.  I just know that it would be unpleasant.  Spinning.  I have good control.  Do you?  Yeah, he's confident, Jimmy.  Where would you kick me?  Come on.  Right in the solar plex.  No.  No, because you'd feel bad your foot would smush in at my stomach.  You don't need that.  I'd take it maybe in the, it would just be embarrassing.  Yeah, you might actually get hurt.  How about a good leg kick? 
[02:28:00]  Okay.  Got a leg kick.  Sure.  Leg kick.  You're going to be walking funny for a while.  I know.  I would take it.  I would request mild, though.  Not to.  I can't think of John Jones kick for real.  A mild.  Yeah, I have to.  Salsa.  I have to.  Salsa.  You have devastating, devastating legs.  Yeah, we've seen your kicks.  Holy shit.  Leg kicks, ladies and gentlemen.  All right.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Oh, shit.  Jim Norton.  I got a little leg kick.  You ever thrown a leg kick this early in the morning?  I haven't.  Five and nine.  This is like a singer.  I remind him of one of those bags that he uses.  Just don't pull anything, please. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  Where are you going to go?  Just so I can.  All right.  So I'm going to get you right around here.  Oh, that already looked painful.  Right there.  Okay.  All right.  So you might want to brace yourself.  Not that hard.  Okay.  All right.  Can you get it?  Okay.  Give me a good angle.  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  All right.  Perfect.  Hands up.  Do I have to do it?  That seems combative.  How about.  Do you want to close your eyes?  No.  I don't want to be combative with my hands.  Go ahead.  That seems combative.  Where are we going?  Right here?  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  One. 
[02:29:00]  Two.  And three.  Oh!  Oh, that was a delayed pain, too.  Come on, Jimmy.  Don't go down.  Don't go down.  Don't go down.  Oh, yeah.  I never went down, Ray.  I feel like I have to shit.  That was all shitting, too.  Oh, that was the worst one ever.  Oh, is that, yeah.  The best leg kicks in me, you don't hear the noise.  Wow.  Yeah, you just, that's all, all your. 
[02:29:30]  Straight to bone.  Dude.  All the weight going on and everything.  And that was just T-ball speed, too.  Oh, yeah.  That was just a little.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Oh, God.  That's a great picture.  Jimmy doesn't know if he wants to keep standing or sit down.  Jesus Christ.  The visual of that on my phone is.  Fuck that.  Wow.  You guys got to look at this on my phone.  It's Jimmy's entire body in the frame and then just his torso.  That's all you can see.  It literally looks like a giant just coming in and kicking Norton in the leg.  Yeah, I was expecting to hear like a crack or a snap or something. 
[02:30:00]  That was just all power thud into.  And where did it hit you, Jimmy?  Right in the thigh.  In the thigh.  Was it like a Charlie Ward feeling?  I slurred his speech already.  I had to piss.  Jimmy, what kind of pain is it?  What kind of pain is it?  I had to puke.  No, you're okay.  It almost instantly takes away from your cardio, don't you think?  Did you get woozy?  I feel like I'm going to puke.  Faint?  Really?  Yeah.  Doesn't it hurt so good?  He kind of likes it.  I think Jimmy simply likes this shit.  You're pale. 
[02:30:30]  You're pale right now.  I do have to pee, though.  Jimmy's into the S&M.  Why don't you go?  Well, we're ready for a break, I think.  He's like, he's a funny gimp.  We'll take a break.  Wait, Jimmy, you're all right?  Jimmy's green.  Wow.  You guys splash some water on your face.  Yeah, your color's a little weird.  He's like going to throw up.  Oh, I'm going to go pee.  You ever do that where you hurt yourself and you feel like you're going to throw up?  Don't leave the tongue in your knee or something.  That's how he feels.  Now I see why Rogan loves the leg kicks.  That took any fight out of him.  I like to do it.  Look, he's limping down the hallway to go to the bathroom. 
[02:31:00]  He's done about a dozen of these.  I think it's over after today.  That was it.  I think he's not doing any more.  That was it.  That was the one that got him.  I loved how he thought that initial pain was the pain.  Yeah.  One three-second, he went, ah!  Oh!  And the best way to get it out is to rub on it, which only hurts worse.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to kind of work it out, I guess, right?  That's going to be a big-time bruise, man.  That's a good one, man.  Jimmy does not look good.  Tweet me a picture of his leg tomorrow.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  What are you on Twitter? 
[02:31:30]  Johnny Bones?  Yeah.  At Johnny Bones.  At Johnny Bones.  J-O-N-N-Y-B-O-N-E-S.  I start following you today!  Yes!  All right.  Johnny Bones on Twitter.  Let's all follow John Jones.  What's your Twitter?  Opie Radio.  Oh, easy.  Yeah.  Actually, I got a little video.  I'll add Johnny Bones.  What was that?  Was that like 8% speed, would you say?  That was about a 15% speed.  15 double digits.  Oh!  Oh, God.  That face and everything.  He got some great still shots. 
[02:32:00]  You guys see the still shots.  Jimmy's face and that.  He's just like, ah!  Yeah.  We'll be tweeting all that shit later.  He'll tweet it with your name so you can check it out.  Oh.  We got great pictures.  You guys see the video that Sam took, too.  I got the front.  I got to commend him.  I would have gone down.  You would have went down?  Yeah, yeah.  I would be honest.  Jimmy was leaning on the console like, oh.  For fear that the fact I didn't, he would do it again.  Oh, I should have kicked him harder.  Nah, nah.  That's all he could take.  He's hurting.  Believe me, he's in the bathroom right now just about crying, splashing water on his face 
[02:32:30]  so he doesn't faint.  Often, you get a free one.  Man.  And it looks slow, but it must be like if a car hit you at like 10 miles an hour.  You know what I mean?  That's not going that fast.  That's me.  It hit him, dude.  Oh, man.  Yeah, yeah.  I really focused on the shin bone digging right into the appropriate spot.  You hit and then straighten your leg out.  It's like all that just is pushing.  I don't get how you guys kick each other basically shin to shin.  Yeah, that's that body condition that I was telling you about.  Getting kicked to the shin.  How do you build up anything in front of your shin where it doesn't hurt you?  Oh, yeah.  It takes a long time to get used to that. 
[02:33:00]  The guys in Thailand, they kick trees.  They kick these trees.  Oh, man.  That's crazy.  But they can't walk by the time they're 40, right?  No, no.  Are they all right?  It just strengthens your, as long as you're not hitting with your knees and you're hitting  an appropriate part of your shin, it conditions your shin.  And it's amazing what the human body can get used to, really.  You can't get used to the foot stomp, though.  Foot stumps, no.  Those are all fragile bones.  And pretty much most guys don't do that, right?  Most guys don't do the foot stomp.  I actually do it.  I do it.  You do it?  But you know what?  It's really not as effective as people may think because the heel of your foot isn't 
[02:33:30]  really that hard, you know?  Right.  Yeah.  So the stomping, it's more annoying.  No, I'm just picturing that.  Are you serious?  And you guys, you know their heels are like a Timberland.  Right.  It's steel.  Like an axe handle.  A martial arts heel.  Fuck yeah.  It would work if you had like a nice dress shoe.  The end of my toes would explode.  We're getting the wrap up, so.  What happened?  Oh, we got to get Jimmy first.  Uh-oh.  Did he puke?  No.  You puke?  No. 
[02:34:00]  Okay.  You know what?  I should have kicked you a lot harder.  Oh, no.  That was really good.  Dude, your color's back.  Your color got a little weird.  I'm not used to taking that kind of impact, and I know that's not nearly as hard as he could  have done it.  Oh, no.  No.  He's bummed out, because we just showed him the video, and he's like, ah, I should have  hit him harder.  Oh, no.  I would.  Can we try it again?  Let's go under legs.  What do you say, ladies?  I would have thrown up on your leg.  I'm amazed.  The reason I do that is I'm such a fan.  I'm amazed by these guys that they can take.  Like, you did that in a gentle, compared to what you could do. 
[02:34:30]  Well, he said it was about 15%.  Yeah.  But, dude.  Can you imagine 100?  But imagine, and his motivation was, I'm trying to take his belt.  John, if you did it 100% to someone like Jimmy, would you break his leg?  Would that break a bone?  He probably wouldn't break, but it'd be hurting real bad by five minutes after the impact.  I would probably pass out.  Yeah, you'd probably pass out.  You'd probably want to be walking on it.  Yeah.  You'd probably want to go to the hospital.  See, the thing is, at 100%, you wouldn't even see it coming. 
[02:35:00]  Oh.  So just imagine someone swinging a baseball at your sciatic nerve.  Without even knowing.  She's just like, hey, how you, oh, fuck.  Kenny got me a bag of ice.  Thanks, buddy.  I'll put this on my leg.  Will you bruised from that, Jimmy?  He will be.  By the time John Jones is in the elevator, I'll be bruised.  He will be.  I didn't even kick him hard.  Put that on your badge.  Could you bleep that?  Okay.  On the video, I'll just say, this was only 15%.  Dude, and I got, Frankie Edgar hit me. 
[02:35:30]  He gave me, like, a little left in the arm, and, oh, what a bruise I had from that.  Well, he wants to see the bruise, so you've got to tweet him.  Johnny.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Johnny Bones.  Johnny Bones.  I swear to God, I'm so, like, if he wanted to see the bruise, I was ready to just drop  my jeans in the studio.  I don't think it's bruised yet, though.  You'd be doing that in prison.  Literally, it's just like.  They don't give you ice in prison.  You see these things, but you never know what these guys are dealing with.  Yeah, what that feels like.  It's amazing to me.  We have to do the old wrap-up, unfortunately. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, shit.  We've been looking forward to this for a while.  Yeah, we're fans, man.  We're big-time fans.  Thanks, man.  I used to be a fan.  You used to be a fan.  No, I'm rooting for you against Machida this Saturday.  Thanks.  Let's plug the.  I think he's my favorite in the UFC right now.  Yeah, it's hard to like anybody more, honestly.  Well, thanks, guys.  It's just how you fight and stuff.  We just love it.  I appreciate it.  It's Machida this coming Saturday, live on pay-per-view.  It's Johnny Bones on Twitter.  What else?  And also, Frank Muir is fighting Minotaur Noguera, and Ortiz is fighting again. 
[02:36:30]  He just doesn't stop.  I know, right?  Against Antonio Ruggiero Noguera.  Which one is Little Noguera?  That would be Antonio, right?  Yeah, Ruggiero.  He's the younger one.  He'll be fighting Tito.  And then Minotaur Noguera is the older one who will be fighting Frank Muir.  Frank Muir.  Yeah, so it's UFC 140, December 10th.  Check it out.  Only on pay-per-view.  What weight do you fight at before you go?  I'm light heavyweight, so I compete at 205, but right now I'm about 220.  So I have 15 pounds to lose this week. 
[02:37:00]  Because the standards and silver comparison people get, but he fights at like, what, 180?  Yeah.  How is that done?  Strong dieting.  Strong dieting.  You wear that glad bag running suit?  You know, I try not to do too much of the sweating.  It's really not good for you in the long term.  But, you know, the day before the fight, the day of weigh-ins, I cut about four pounds of sweat, which is pretty easy.  Because, you know, with a P to your light, maybe an IV or something, you know, you can get it all bad.  That's amazing.  But, yeah, I was a strong diet. 
[02:37:30]  You're going to lose 15 pounds this week?  You know, I was a wrestler throughout high school and college, so I think I've developed that level of discipline to walk away from the cheeseburgers.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, unbelievable.  You almost made me throw up from a leg kick.  That is a, wow, that's a fucking amazing.  I wish I would have kicked him harder.  Oh, I couldn't.  Oh, to see him just spewing vomit.  That would have been the greatest ever.  Oh, yeah.  If he kicked him and he'd just project out and vomited.  And for the video, I kind of wish it would have looked cool.  We would still be laughing.  Yeah, but that was a fucking, wow. 
[02:38:00]  I say you guys have me on after the fight, and I kick him in the other leg.  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Yeah.  Why not?  I mean, just put me in.  That's a celebration of your big victory.  I love that.  Yes.  No, because he'll be a little surly after the fight, too.  Don't lose.  No.  How about after?  If you lose, then that kick is going to be ugly, Jimmy.  He'll take your leg off.  Jesus, how do you take that in the face?  I don't get it.  How the fuck the guys take that?  I just don't get it.  They don't take it.  It's superhuman.  That's the key.  Well, John Jones, I hope you're a champion for a long time, man.  Absolutely.  I really mean that.  You're a great champion and great spokesman for the UFC, and you were great on The Tonight 
[02:38:30]  Show when you did Leno.  That was awesome.  Thank you, man.  I really appreciate it.  John, thanks.  Proud to be a New Yorker.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Thank you, Brian.  Good luck, John.  All right, John.  Good luck.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. Live.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  Fuck you.

[02:41:30]  We got Bill Burr in studio still.  Joe DeRosa's floating around here.  Jimmy's back.  I am in pain, man.  And John Jones.  What a nice guy he is, too, man.  I literally like him a lot.  I don't know why I say literally first.  Yes.  Oh, man.  You are really aching that leg.  I almost threw up.  Like, I almost threw up from that.  And I realize it's because my body is not used to taking blunt force impact like that. 
[02:42:00]  Oh.  Maybe on your ass.  Yeah.  If he had put four fingers in my ass, I would have laughed my way through the entire segment.  Where did it hit you?  He hit me.  Right above the knee?  No, no, no, no, no.  He didn't go close to the knee.  He did it at a place where he knew there'd be no real damage.  Up on the upper, like the strongest part of your leg.  Oh, that's going to be a great bruise.  The charley horse place.  He did it where the charley horse is.  Oh, that's going to be a great bruise.  The fucking light heavyweight champion.  Frankie, did I show you the Frankie Edgar picture?  No, you never.  I never saw that.  I Twittered it. 
[02:42:30]  He gave me a little shot in the arm.  Like a little fucking.  But these guys punch.  It's like a melon.  Dude, I don't know how anybody.  Like these guys, I know that they're conditioned.  But when they're up against the cage, there's a guy standing there.  That's what they're doing to each other.  Like when they're trying to like get out of a clinch.  They're just doing these leg kicks and these knees.  The fucking face.  And constant.  Like imagine you felt that.  Imagine feeling it again and then again in the same place.  What I just felt.  About one of those at 100%. 
[02:43:00]  At 100%.  And then they do it over and over again after that.  And he's continuing to try to do it.  Yeah, like how Rogan, you know, always talks about those leg kicks.  They're starting to wear them down.  I've seen a few fights where you just keep hearing the slap of the guy's shin against the dude's leg.  And even those guys after like probably like eight is when they start to start leaning.  Yeah.  I can never handle it.  I love that guy though, man.  Johnny, John Jones.  Hi, buddy.  Oh, my God.  He's got a big bag of ice on his leg now. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, I have to.  Only because, you know, I want to be able to walk today.  Yes.  I have to, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That's going to hurt.  If I take my knee, like, you know, remember when you're a kid and you do the cannonball  where you tuck your knees in?  If I tuck my knee in, well, I couldn't just say that.  I had to mention the cannonball like a faggot.  If you tuck your knee in, it hurts.  I can't tuck my leg all the way in.  That's only going to feel worse as time goes on.  Of course it is.  And like tomorrow after sleeping and waking up, it's just going to be utter pain. 
[02:44:00]  I would guess by the end of the, well, he's icing it.  But by the end of the show, just sitting down, that's what it's going to freeze up on you,  lock up a little bit.  Icing it is smart, though, right?  No, not really.  Opie.  Doesn't help.  Opie.  What do you think, Joe?  What?  What do you think from where you were sitting?  The guy's amazing.  I had to shit so bad, though, through the entire interview.  I couldn't focus.  That's why I had to leave.  My stomach hurts.  This guy's talking about choking people down at the ground.  And I'm just like, my tummy hurts.  It was like, I got to shit. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, no, she asked that one question.  It kind of went around and around in a circle.  And I'd hear you be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, fuck it.  Yeah, yeah, fuck it.  I got to shit.  I couldn't get it out.  Did you see the kick?  Yeah, no, I saw that.  But I was trying to ask you.  I don't think I was being clear when I said, how did it hurt?  I mean, I know it hurt a lot, but what kind of pain is it?  Is it shooting pain?  Is it just like unbelievable ache?  No, it's your whole body says, fall down, get everything out of your system, vomit. 
[02:45:00]  It's that tingly.  I'm glad I walked to the bathroom.  I really did have to piss the whole interview because we didn't break before John came in.  So I did have to pee.  And I'm like, let me just walk down and pee.  And I splashed a little.  I was fine.  By the time I pissed, I felt okay.  I want to see him do it to DeRosa.  Oh, man.  DeRosa would cry.  You, for some reason, Jim, you're built for pain.  I think you get some sort of odd pleasure out if you feel closer to the fighters.  There's something in it for you.  But this kid here, I'm telling you, his glasses, just the whole thing. 
[02:45:30]  I just realized we were on the air.  You told that shit story thinking we were just off the air?  Yeah, I don't care.  I just thought we were on a break.  Joe just really just puts it out there.  He doesn't give a shit.  He's like, oh, is this on the air?  Oh, what?  Why do we all have headphones on and we're talking into microphones?  I wish it was better, though.  I blew Bailey J.  What?  Don't say anything, guys.  What, do you want to make everyone jealous? 
[02:46:00]  Look at Jimmy keeping his legs moving.  Yeah, I am.  I'm just fucking, I'm just moving my right leg.  Here's what it is.  When an athlete's training, sometimes we take a few bumps.  Am I right or wrong, guys?  We can't argue with you.  He said the best thing, when you were growing, he said the best thing to do was rub it out.  He said, but that's going to make it hurt worse, but that will get it out.  Yeah, like to rub on it.  Oh.  I rub it out every night.  Deep tissue massage.  Yeah, probably right.  He should have kicked it in your dick.  Oh, that hurt right there.  I wonder if he really would have kicked me in my solar plexus. 
[02:46:30]  He might have knocked the wind out of me.  Oh, that would have.  You'd have been.  I'll be afraid that would kill me.  Because he's a young guy.  John's 24.  And again, he's, he's, I, he's to me much scarier than a guy like Anderson.  Yeah.  Because Anderson Silva probably kicks as hard, if not harder.  I'd love to hurt you.  You go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  But Anderson, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, with all the wind knocked out of you.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't take, but I knew better than to take it there. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  Not that.  I don't want to get my fucking ribs broken.  You took it with poise, man.  If I, if I got hit like that, I'd literally sell like one of the three stooges.  I'd be like, oh, oh, oh, oh.  That one, by, by far, that was the worst one.  By far.  Jesus Christ.  And he did 15%.  By far.  What's his name only did, what did he say, 10?  Anderson Silva did about, we didn't have Anderson because he speaks broken English.  He's Portuguese.  We, we didn't have as much.  We had a good time with him, but not as much of a, it was more question and answer instead 
[02:47:30]  of just hanging out and goofing off.  You should keep upping the percentage to see what point we get where you actually puke.  All right.  I took 15.  Your color.  John Jones.  Got to go 20.  I literally, I was going to vomit.  Your system, whatever happened to your system.  Dude, your color changed, man.  The color left your face.  It was just white.  You were kind of a whitish green.  It was funny.  There was a green hue to you.  But you do feel, not closer to the fighters, like I could do that, but to understand, like  the respect level goes so much farther through the roof.  Absolutely.  Because to take that fucking punishment from this guy, I just want to hug Loyola Machida. 
[02:48:00]  Like, what are you doing?  Stay home.  Fucking terrible.  You guys do.  Hurts.  Everybody wants to do that.  If you want to go to a baseball park and have someone, just don't hit me in the head,  but throw a fastball, let me just, just throw it like at three quarters.  Let me see if I can get around it.  That's boring to those guys.  He wanted to kick you full, he wanted to kick you at least 50%.  Nah, he wouldn't, I don't think he would, I don't think he wanted to, to, to put me  out of commission for good, but you know, he's, he's one of those guys, again, he's  in fight mode, man.  He's fighting in a week.  He's in fucking fight mode. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy's ice it.  Yeah, that's ice it.  Or imagine a fastball pitcher just nailing one into your back.  Dude, I would rather have taken it in the stomach than where you took it.  No way.  No way.  I would have thrown up.  I would have thrown up.  No, no, I rather would have.  Because I feel like you can tense that up, you can exhale, the shit you can do, I mean,  I'm not saying it wouldn't kill.  I'm going to tell Houdini that.  I can't, but, but, nothing fucking hurts.  It's Charlie Horse, yeah.  Beyond the balls, nothing hurts like Charlie Horse and the shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's simple, but it's such a strong muscle in your body, and I've been told by a lot 
[02:49:00]  of massage therapists, I have great legs.  I have very strong legs.  Surprising.  He has inexplicably Mr. Olympian, like, midget legs.  I don't understand.  He really has shapely, in shape, fucking...  It's the calf muscles.  Dude, my calves are fucking...  They're terrific.  I have beautiful calves.  They're pretty amazing.  They're a thing of beauty.  Bowling pins.  I can argue with you, Jimmy.  They're beautiful.  All your vices go from, like, the belt, the belt up, like, all of his, his awful shoulders.  Like, I just...  Look at that. 
[02:49:30]  He's got, like, Larry Zonka legs.  It's fucking hilarious.  It's like somebody twisted his out-of-shaped body into those things.  I've never understood it.  I've always said it's like I'm two different people.  I literally sit in my waist down.  All-American.  He's an all-American.  Yeah, right.  Fucking Larry Zonka.  That's fucking great.  You really do.  You have white fullback legs from the 1970s.  But imagine having your leg broken.  Like, I think of that, too. 
[02:50:00]  Like, when Theismann had his leg.  Like, the agony of that.  He said he watched that replay once.  He goes, I never need to see that again.  Yeah.  Really?  That was the original bloody sock.  Everybody brings up Kurt Schilling.  Yeah, fuck that.  Yeah, his was a compound fracture.  I bet Theismann was like, yeah, I really don't see the big deal of this.  I can't imagine.  I've never broken anything except a finger.  I mean, I can't imagine what a leg must feel like.  When you see him go back on that leg, and then it just does that.  It's the rigid, rigid, boom, it's gone. 
[02:50:30]  One of Joe's shoes would have came off, you know?  You know, you get hit by a car.  Yeah, yeah.  Knocked out of your shoes.  You get your shoes, yeah.  That's how out of shape Joe is.  No one ever ties their shoes tight enough.  I guess that's it.  I don't know.  It just seems like how do you get knocked out of your fucking shoes?  It's amazing to me.  No, that's when you get into the epic level of a beatdown.  If you lose footwear.  Yeah.  There's really, like, if there's, if you have to, like, I used to do a bit, like, if you  have to, like, collect your personal belongings, like, where's my comb? 
[02:51:00]  Does anybody say, like, come off, yeah, after a beating, you gotta pick your shit up.  Jesus Christ.  That is bad.  Jesus Christ.  I saw two guys, when I used to work in a warehouse, got into a fight.  It was one guy who was, like, 6'6 and skinny, and the other guy was about 6'1 and fat, and  the fat he had on these sweatpants, and I don't know what the fuck happened, because they  started going at it, so I called my friends.  By the time I turned back, somehow the fat guy was, like, upside down, and it was change  just pouring out of his pockets.  It's fucking, you know, there's no carpet in the warehouse, dude. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, like, clang.  Like, five guys came over to break it up and immediately dropped to their knees and  just couldn't even move, paralyzed with fucking laughter.  What were those fucking pants people had in the 80s?  The sweats by EBs.  They were, like, that style with the little line thing.  The Joey Butterfuoco sweats?  The Zubas or whatever?  Yeah.  That looked like they had, like, the zebra print and shit like that?  Is that what they were called?  The Joey Butterfucos.  Yeah.  I just know it was Joey Butterfucos. 
[02:52:00]  And change porn.  It was almost like he had him in the guard.  And then the six-foot-six guy stood up, and he kept his legs wrapped around.  I think that that's how it came out.  If I could over-explain it anymore.  Fuck it.  Fighting stinks, man.  Never a big fighter, man.  No.  Me.  Yeah, I'm useless.  I'm too afraid of getting hit, is what it is.  I do not.  I don't like the idea of getting a fist into my face.  I'm not afraid of getting hit.  I have a complete inability to not get hit. 
[02:52:30]  Like, you could literally tell me, Bill, I'm going to throw a straight jab right at  something.  I'm throwing it right at your face.  And I could still...  I don't know what the fuck I'm looking at.  How do you defend against it?  I could never get out of the way of it.  Ever.  I don't even know how to set up for a fight.  Like, I don't know the right stance.  I would absolutely get the one from the side of the head punching me.  Just watching you throw a hook right there, you could just tell.  No, no, that was like somebody else doing that to me.  You look like you're swinging your purse, you married. 
[02:53:00]  What are you doing?  You masher?  I was imitating the other guy punching me on the side of the head.  Jesus Christ.  No, I'm just...  I'm useless.  I have no idea what to do.  I see why you collect guns.  Yes, I need lead to be propelled at great velocity into my enemy.  He couldn't even use, like, a sword.  He couldn't do anything that involved just the simple movement of pulling a trigger. 
[02:53:30]  Do you have problems with rifles where you have to coordinate both hands to hold it?  No, I'm very good.  And close one eye?  Ah, shit.  I just saw all the torture of every gym class you ever went to.  He was picking Anthony.  He was sitting there in his Kevlar fucking sweatpants.  That was me.  The guy not to pick.  Yeah.  I just tweeted John Jones' shin kick to Jim Norton's thigh. 
[02:54:00]  Is there?  And then Sam's got a better one.  But this one is pretty damn good just off my dumb phone.  Okay.  And then Sam's going to put another video up later today or tomorrow.  So check it out.  I just tweeted it.  Opie Radio.  It's hilarious.  I think it's the best one yet.  I almost threw up.  No, but I mean, but just your reaction and everything else.  The whole fucking thing.  Yeah.  You fight?  Did you ever have been in a fight, Opie?  I've been in a million fights.  Were you like a good brawler?  I did all right.  Back in the day? 
[02:54:30]  I did okay, I guess.  Just okay.  You and Burr got that like Boston, Long Island.  We're kind of psychotic.  I'll make it perfectly clear.  I don't ever want to be in another fight.  I'm not going to be cocky about it.  But back in the day, yeah, bar fights and shit.  I never had those.  Stupid shit.  I had those dual headlock fights.  You give?  You give?  A lot of wrestling.  More wrestling than, you know, just squaring off.  Right.  I was in a dumb fraternity, so there was always a problem.  You always were in a bar room brawl. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, and you were back like when fraternities were, am I saying fraternity?  Fraternity was a fraternity, sorry.  I would say so, even though I still get abused for being a woman.  Pre-date rape.  Yeah.  Pre-hazing laws.  Oh, yeah.  Pre-hazing laws, absolutely.  It was just a girl that was ready to party.  I had to pick up marshmallows from my fucking ass cheeks, man.  I never understood the homoerotic shit.  I know.  To go into those.  Like, I came in, you know, a few years behind you, 
[02:55:30]  so I was right at the...  Did you have some of that shit that you had to do?  I didn't.  That's why I never went out for football.  Like, football, they had this whole thing.  You had to fucking...  They had the cheese ball race.  You had to run over, pick up cheese ball up with your butt cheeks  and run over and drop it into a cup.  It's like, what?  The fuck is that about?  I want to play football.  Hey, you did the same thing.  Did you actually do that?  No, that's why I didn't go out for football.  I had to do the same thing with marshmallows.  And you did it.  I did it with cum.  We had a bomb.  I mean, this is really embarrassing 
[02:56:00]  because we haven't had Chris Rock on our show in a while  and he's hearing us talk about lifting shit with our ass cheeks.  No, I tapped.  You didn't do that.  Yeah, I was like, I don't get...  Oh, fraternities were the same thing.  Like, they had all that fucking weird fucking ass play  and it's just like...  And then what?  Then we're going to hang out?  I know.  It's like, all I want to do is have a keg party with the sorority.  I don't have to pick up things with my ass cheeks.  I don't know.  With that, we say hi to Chris Rock.  Chris Rock, everybody.  Sorry, Chris.  Chris? 
[02:56:30]  Or maybe his people are getting Chris Rock.  It's Chris.  All right.  Hey, Chris.  Hey.  Hey, man.  How are you?  Hey, buddy.  How are you?  It's been a while.  Yeah?  Yeah, we're on the air.  We got Bill Burns, Studio, Joe Rosa, Jim Norton, and me and Ant.  When do the funny people get it?  How are you doing, man?  How are you doing, man?  I'm Chris.  Can't complain.  You're done with Broadway.  Before you even talk about anything else, I had to say to you publicly, you were fucking 
[02:57:00]  amazing in your play.  You're a much better actor than I realized.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You know, after Pootie Tang, you know, it's all up to you.  I love Pootie Tang.  I never saw it.  What?  How do you not see Pootie Tang?  Well, Louie told us the story about how, like, you know, you have one vision, but then  sometimes the studio steps in and they do what they got to do.  Well, when we do Pootie Tang on Broadway, you're all invited.  Oh, right on.  I don't doubt that that would happen.  Like, there's no doubt that that could actually happen. 
[02:57:30]  Can I tip my, also, Chris, I never really met you before, but I've always wanted to tell  you this.  Me and my friends in high school, before I ever did comedy, we're obsessed with CB4.  I'm still obsessed with it.  I think it's hilarious.  And I tip my hat to you for recognizing the utter genius of Charlie Murphy before anybody  did.  Before anybody.  Chappelle is such a genius because all those Charlie Murphy stories that are on the Chappelle  show, he told them on the set of CB4. 
[02:58:00]  I knew all those stories years and years, 15 years in advance, and then I'm watching  Chappelle's show, I'm like, oh my God, I could have had all of that stuff.  You're kind of like the college coach, that you could have drafted, like, Jeter to play  for you, but you just kind of, like, enjoyed watching him and then ignored him.  Exactly, exactly.  That's all right, man.  Obviously.  With this 12th selection, Chris Rock selects Ken O'Brien. 
[02:58:30]  Dan Marino reference, nobody.  That was a good one.  No, I got it.  I'm a Jets fan.  Hey, O'Brien's, you know, better than Sanchez.  The old pick six.  Yeah, Sanchez, I don't know, he makes us a little nervous as Jets fans.  No, that's Sanchez, but O'Brien, you know.  What do you think of Tebow?  You want to talk football.  Wow!  No kidding!  Wow!  Man, I guess other teams are going to start letting linebackers play quarterback.  Yeah, he's 6-1 as a starter now, and it's very unconventional, as we all know. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, but it's like baseball, you know.  You know, like in baseball, the guy gets hot, then, you know.  When he goes through the league a second time, let me see what happens.  When they figure him out.  When they figure out that Prohibition-era offense that they're running.  Fucking pitch it to fucking Curly or Larry.  They need to update it.  I swear to God, I saw that offense on the three Stooges one time.  Hey, lateral it to me, Mo. 
[02:59:30]  I'm sorry, we missed that.  What was that?  I'm sorry, Chris, we were lucky.  If Tebow plays like there's no black guys on the field.  And he loves his God.  He wants everyone to know how much he loves God.  Now, in defense of him.  God actually decided to back a shitty football player.  Yeah.  It's working for him.  What was Bill going to say?  In defense of Tebow, he talked about Jesus in college. 
[03:00:00]  He hasn't done it yet.  They just keep putting the camera on him when he starts speaking in tongues.  Every time they kick a field goal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, God really cares.  Sounds like an auctioneer.  Yeah.  All right.  I just know everybody.  Everybody in the red states are so excited.  This has got to be their guy for like the last 20 years.  Oh, yeah.  Very religious.  And he's winning.  He wears a vest.  He's clean cut. 
[03:00:30]  He's into Jesus.  He's a good boy.  Pretty amazing what he's doing.  Unbelievable.  Well, Chris, obviously, you know, if I could Patrice, we're all just.  Obviously, you want me to replace Patrice, and I accept.  Yes.  Come on in.  We're sick over it.  This is, everyone has been saying how rough this one is.  This is just a rough one.  It is a rough one because, I mean, first of all, people don't realize how full of life this guy was.  Yep.  Yep.  Like, just absolutely filled up a room when he walked in a room, and he was so funny, and he was just figuring out what he did. 
[03:01:00]  You know what I mean?  He was just figuring out how to take that thing he did in the restaurant and put it on stage.  You know what I mean?  Yes.  The thing he did off stage was coming on stage, and he was, you know, it's like the comedic Lynn Bias, if anything.  You know what I mean?  You're like, this guy was really getting ready to, we were all getting ready to have work for Patrice O'Neal. 
[03:01:30]  That's basically what was getting ready to happen.  He was figuring it all out right in front of our eyes.  He was there, man.  Yeah, I know.  When Elephant in the Room came out, I was excited for him, and I was nervous.  I was like, is he going to make me look like a child?  Because, like, he was that, like, it was literally what he was saying.  I almost felt like once it was his to take, once he just decided he wanted it.  That's the level.  That's what I always told him.  Yeah.  Right, right.  I always told him, like, look around.  Do you see anybody as funny as you? 
[03:02:00]  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  Jimmy said it last week.  He could be funny with anyone.  You can't think of one person.  He wouldn't be as funny or funnier.  Like, any comic you could put him in the room with who's ever worked, and he would be comfortable being funny with them.  Yes, yes.  I mean, we're all established guys here.  Is any one of us, does any one of us really want to follow the guy?  Right.  No.  No, he used to hold court.  He actually was so funny, he could get comedians who are always trying to top people's stories to actually shut up and become audience members. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  Like, that time he went at it with the transvestite out in front of that?  Oh, God, I forgot about that.  Dude, it was literally just some transvestite was coming down the street, and he was just in one of those moods where he felt like fucking with somebody, and he fucked with this transvestite.  And she immediately came right back at him.  Said, remember that line?  She said, you got so many spaces between your teeth, looks like your tongue's in jail.  That's what started it.  Jesus Christ.  And he hit her with shit just as big.  Dude, and we just sat there, it was like, it was the comedic version. 
[03:03:00]  You ever see that tape of Biggie when he was just got in that rap battle in the middle of, like the purest form?  Right.  It was like the purest form of comedy.  There was no security.  There was no crowd, like a crowd just developed around what the fuck was happening.  And he just sat there, and, you know, she hit him with a couple of stock lines, and he like, Ali, leaned on the ropes, let the he-she punch yourself out, and then he just fucking destroyed her.  But it was unbelievable.  I remember just really in that moment going, this guy is like, this guy is, he is truly special. 
[03:03:30]  You know, you're really not going to see another one.  That was a one-off.  That was it.  He's fucking, his ability, I showed my parents, my parents were visiting this week, and I showed them elephant in the room, because they didn't know who Patrice was.  They just knew that he was, I had a friend that passed or whatever, and I showed it to him.  My dad's a Catholic church deacon, and my dad was red-faced and laughing hysterically at Patrice going, why can't we have Harassment Day, you know? 
[03:04:00]  Excuse me, hell, I always wanted you to know, would you suck my dick in the broom closet?  Like, the fact that he can make a fucking man of the cloth laugh as hard as, like, Bill or me or any, you know, whatever, it's fucking, it's uncanny, man.  Uncanny ability.  There was nothing better than seeing Patrice meet somebody for the first time who was, like, impressed with themselves, and they thought they were on some level of accomplishment.  I saw him one time, he made this fucking white dude, a 50-year-old guy, you could just tell he ran a company or something, and he just was so used to running shit. 
[03:04:30]  As he sat in the crowd, he had this vibe like he was running it, even though he was at the show, like you were a performer for him.  You know, Patrice got on stage, he just, he didn't have to meet the guy, just sensed it.  He made this guy so fucking mad.  I was actually standing behind the guy, and I could see the anger in the back of his head and his shoulders.  You know, Patrice had that laugh when he was really getting you that, like, what?  He enjoyed it.  Sounded like a fucking trumpet.  And he's just laughing in this guy's face, and then he finally said something like, you look like you want to fire me, but you can't. 
[03:05:00]  And that was the one that just fucking leveled the room, and I'm so fucking sad about this show.  I couldn't wait for him to get big, because I wanted to see those TMZ guys to try to fuck with him at the airport.  Like, how much he would have enjoyed that and destroyed him, and they would have, it's just, it's the worst fucking thing ever.  Yeah, it's horrible.  There's so many things that, you know, are going to happen that you would just love to know what his take was going to be on it.  Chris, you helped him, too, in a weird way, because when you were on the show at K-Rock with us, and Patrice was in, 
[03:05:30]  and it kind of turned into an intervention, because you were telling him that, like, you wanted him for your show,  and, you know, it just, he might have been hard to be around.  And you told him kind of with love, and that really...  I think it changed him.  It absolutely changed him.  I love the guy.  I, you know, he's just one of those guys that, the moment he started getting out of his own way...  That's exactly it.  ...it was all going to open up for him, and that's what was happening.  And when I was on the show, and by the way, what I did on the show is what I did every time I saw him. 
[03:06:00]  Right.  I was like, buddy, you're funnier than everybody.  Jesus.  Embrace it.  Come in.  Smile.  Don't worry.  The white man is not going to beat your ass today.  It's okay.  You know?  He loved putting a spark to a bridge, though.  He loved putting a spark to a bridge.  Oh, boy. 
[03:06:30]  You could burn a bridge like that guy, and it was fucking hilarious, but, like, oh, so you'd just be like, what are you doing?  It's like, cross it first, then burn it.  Jimmy, not every bridge.  It's just burst, didn't it?  Right, right, right.  Did he ever tell you that story when he went into CBS, which was like a notoriously cold room during this era?  It was like he walked in, they had the lights low, like that guy who ran that team in the natural.  You know what I mean?  Like the fucking baseball owner.  You would just go in there, dude, like already sweating, and you'd start tap dancing, and they wouldn't give it up for anything.  And he walked in there, maybe tap dance for half a second, and right in the middle of the meeting, you know? 
[03:07:00]  You're pitching a show to get a deal.  There's an invisible bag of money sitting there, and he just says, fuck it, and he starts looking at every executive there and starts pointing at everybody.  You don't like me.  You don't like me.  And you don't like me.  He just started trashing them.  Unknown comic.  And I was laughing my ass off him.  I'd be, Priest, do you realize that that story was on the other side of Hollywood before you even got back to your rented Dodge Neon?  Why would you do that?  And he's like, man, I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck. 
[03:07:30]  Fuck, I'm going to sit there and do 3,000 miles to have you staring at me?  That's why he came in to audition for Everybody Hates Quits.  Didn't know his lines.  Like, y'all don't want me.  I was dying to give him the part.  Oh, Jesus.  Can you imagine?  Yeah, he was defensive sometimes when he didn't need to be.  Like, I think sometimes he didn't understand how much people would just love him or how much people enjoyed him.  He knew he was so funny.  But, you know, look, everybody else, you know, he's a comedian.  He's fucking got major problems like we all do. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  And I think he never understood that, man, people really will embrace you and they don't mind your shitty, cynical.  Like, you're so funny.  People will just love you.  We used to joke about the supreme confidence that hacks have.  You know what I mean?  They just never, they never question their talent.  They just never do.  They never question their talent.  They just always, they go on stage with supreme confidence in their fucking prolific mediocrity.  Always coming out with another special.  Always feel like, yeah, America needs to hear this. 
[03:08:30]  And then you get a guy like Patrice where it's like, dude, you talking to yourself in the shower should be a fucking album.  And you're trying to get the dude off the, I don't know, man.  That's probably going to hurt, you know.  It just fucking hurts.  Because he was about to do it on his terms, too.  You know, we talk about all the bridges he burned, but he was about to do it on his terms, finally.  Hey, Chris.  Sorry, Chris.  The other moral of the story is, you know, despite, you know, Biggie being, you know, so big and heavy D and all that, hey, fat's not good. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Yep.  Yeah.  And just because you're popular and you get laid, it doesn't mean you're healthy.  Goddamn.  I know.  You know, Louie was saying that.  You can't live off of chicken wings from the Chinese restaurant.  Louie was saying he's just pissed at himself for not going over there and saying, hey, asshole, what are you doing to yourself?  I think people tried, to be honest with you. 
[03:09:30]  Patrice is smart enough to know.  Yeah, they tried.  He's not a dumb guy.  He knew, but it's like anything else, when someone's drinking too much or smoking cigarettes, death is like an intangible, faraway thing.  You know it's there, but it's not like a gun pointed at you.  Do you know, last night, somebody from England, a comedian from England, this is how much this guy's love, flew all the way over here on his own dime to come to the funeral today.  And he was telling this story.  They were doing a TV taping in London.  So, of course, Patrice doesn't give a fuck.  He's treating this like, you know, Europe's Friday night videos.  He doesn't give a shit, right? 
[03:10:00]  And for some reason, they had a book in the green room, I guess, that was, it had a list of all these comedians that were so far down the ladder, they didn't have a manager or an agent.  They just had their phone number, their home phone number.  So, Patrice, instead of preparing for his set, starts calling these guys over in England.  He called one guy up at a puppet.  And he goes, yeah, how much to book the puppet?  I just want to get the puppet.  I don't want to book you.  He asked another guy, how much would it cost to get you to just stop? 
[03:10:30]  Fucking hilarious.  Yeah, so nobody was paying attention to the taping.  They were all gathering around Patrice once again, holding court.  And everyone just laughing, like, call another one, call another one.  Just effortless.  I've totally butchered that story.  No, that's him.  That is him.  Funny, man.  The same guy.  It's Brendan Burns, is who you're talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah, Brendan Burns.  We were doing the nasty show in Montreal.  And Brendan came over to hang out backstage.  And he was going off about English comedy and how good the scene is.  And Patrice just goes, English comedy stinks. 
[03:11:00]  And did a 10-minute just improv sketch of an English comedy club.  And he's just going, coming to the stage, Ian Igglepuss.  And he's just making up these ridiculous things.  Oh, bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo.  Get the fuck out of here, you stink.  Y'all are 30 years behind us.  I was the king of England when I went over there.  It was so fucking funny, man.  Oh, motherfucker.  Yeah.  And you're like, wow, I wish I had anything in my act half that fucking funny. 
[03:11:30]  And he just said that all off the top of his goddamn head for 10 minutes.  And that was, you know.  It was almost like he didn't even write.  That was the creepy thing about Patrice.  He didn't know what was his material that he wrote.  Go with that, Opie.  Go with that.  I'm serious.  No, he didn't.  He just, let's like fuck.  You don't think he wrote at all, right?  It's like Jay-Z.  Jay-Z, I heard he just is all in his fucking head.  Right.  The same thing.  I've known him 20 years.  Never saw him go, hey, I got to go into CBS and get a notebook.  Right.  Never saw him with a laptop.  I don't care what he says. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  There were so many times on the radio show we would say, please, save that for the air.  That's amazing.  Like he didn't, he couldn't stop.  We'd go to break and he was just as funny just hanging out.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I haven't seen Elephant in the room.  I don't watch stuff that, you know, you just don't want to see what the guys you know  are doing.  It really is fucking good, man.  I watched a clip.  I just, a clip about being mean to animals and it was like, God, fucking body was great.  Yeah, he nailed it.  You never want to understand that your peer is so great.  Like, you know what I mean?  I mean, nobody recognizes that they're, they're working with, with such greatness and it's 
[03:12:30]  like when someone dies, then you reflect.  Right.  But while you're seeing it, you don't realize it's like, God damn.  He's got a CD coming out called Mr. P.  Mr. P.  Yeah.  That he was putting together.  This isn't one of those things where the family rushed out because, you know, he died.  Oh, no.  He was, he was responsible for it.  This is something he wanted out there and, uh, yeah, they're taking pre-orders now.  And, and Jonathan said the other day, it's brilliant.  This thing, Mr. P is brilliant.  Yeah.  And it's available on iTunes and Amazon now for pre-order if you guys want to go out  and get it.  And the money's going to the family. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  The CD company actually switched the deal to give his family more money.  That's great.  They're taking a lower percentage.  Yep.  Was anybody else on that benefit we did that one time for the rescue dogs?  No.  You was at a Steinberg gig that we did this gig and it was like, we show up, you figured  it's for rescue dogs.  We're working for free.  Everyone's going to be paying attention.  It was this Manhattan, just who's who shit.  And nobody was paying attention.  The only two people paying attention were two cast members of Queer Eye for the straight  guy.  This was like fucking eight years ago.  And, uh, so I go up first and like an idiot, I go right into my act and I just immediately 
[03:13:30]  start bombing.  Nobody's paying attention to me.  I'm working for free.  And all I can hear is Patrice laughing at the back of the fucking thing, right?  Like each one of us tried to adjust somehow to kill and none of us could.  We all ate our balls.  And then Patrice went up there and opened with talking about how we had a puppy for breakfast  and went through the whole preparation of it and just pissed everybody off in the room.  And then right when he had everybody listening, he just trashed everybody in the room and  this whole thing. 
[03:14:00]  So the lady who ran the event with her, I run shit fucking dress she had on was telling  him, she goes, she told him to get off the stage and he was just going.  And, and he's going, no, I'm not getting off the stage.  She goes, she goes, I put this thing together.  He goes, bitch, I don't give a fuck.  And he just kept going.  Oh man.  No, he wouldn't get off the stage.  And then they turned off the microphone and there was a piano on stage.  So he sits down at the piano and starts playing the piano, which he can't.  And I remember he's just sitting there banging it.  And as she's yelling at him, he just looked over the impish smile ever, just looking over 
[03:14:30]  smiling.  And I was just so fucking happy he did it.  And I was so mad that I didn't think to fucking, why I went up there like a hat in hand.  My dad's wacky and just ate my balls.  It was, it was, I mean, I prepare a puppy.  That's brilliant.  He was one of those friends, one of those comedians who could be your fucking hero in  any given moment by doing something like that.  Like, God damn it.  I love the fact that he fucking had the balls.  He was, uh, he was very, he was impossible to own Patrice because there's nothing you 
[03:15:00]  could dangle in his face that he couldn't walk away from.  Like he literally could not be controlled.  You remember when the seller tried to kick him out?  The seller kicked him out and then we all, he hung around the corner.  So we would all do our sets and then leave because we wanted to hang around with him.  So why did the seller kick him out?  Well, he had an argument with Manny, I think, but it was, it was, uh, it was, it was a mistake.  It was a misunderstanding.  I watched it happen and Manny mistook. 
[03:15:30]  Uh, Patrice was asking him if he had false teeth.  And we would tease each other all the time there.  And he was, it was getting to, I think that was something Manny was sensitive about because  he was 70 and it was one of the only things I guess that was, that was like his Achilles.  And Patrice really didn't know.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't say anything bad about this.  I got kicked out for a minute.  Everybody at some point, you know, you're, you're late or whatever you do, whatever.  And then they, they got to throw down the gauntlet.  So I think he didn't want to come back.  I'm saying, I think that like, he just said, fuck this.  I'm not going back. 
[03:16:00]  And he just didn't want to go back.  Well, all I know is, so now we would just all go hang where he was at.  So then they had to let him back in.  You just, you couldn't beat him.  Oh, so because everybody was leaving the club.  Because we were all going to leave.  Yeah.  And then, you know, they want people hanging around or whatever.  So they had to let him back in.  And then he figured that out going, that was kind of golden handcuffs that they let me back in.  So then what he did was he was back in, but he wouldn't put in for spots and would just  go down there and hang out.  It was always chess with him.  Oh, yeah.  It was awesome.  You got to respect that though, man.  Yeah. 
[03:16:30]  He was at Caroline's one night and there was a work, like a Christmas party there.  Fucking 25 people and their female boss.  So of course, like you're waiting for it.  You're like, when's he going to attack the boss?  Oh, man.  And finally, he gets around to it and he goes, let me tell y'all how she likes to get fucked.  He goes, see how she wear her hair up in that bun?  She likes to let that shit down.  She likes a dude to wrap that shit around his fist five, six times and pull her head  down like a horse and go, bitch, shut the fuck up. 
[03:17:00]  Fucking all of her employees are laughing at her.  She's staring at Patrice, dude, like venom.  And Patrice just goes, bitch, don't give me boss eyes.  I don't work for you.  Fucking maniac.  That's fantastic.  Gonna fucking miss him, man.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Goddamn.  I want to thank Chris for calling in.  Yeah, Chris.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate it, Chris.  Thanks for having me. 
[03:17:30]  I'm sure I'll see you guys tonight, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is a bummer.  Well, you know.  What the fuck are you going to do?  Yeah.  That's the easy way to get around.  Chris is in great shape, so we're good there.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm in decent shape, but let's work on a towel.  Yeah.  He won't stop smoking.  I feel like a fucking nudge ant.  Every time I see him, I want to just go stop.  Because he quit drinking.  He's doing good.  He looks okay, but fucking he won't stop smoking.  Yeah.  It's like, will you stop?  Fucking stop it. 
[03:18:00]  I need one vice.  Yeah, he smokes a lot.  He smokes a lot.  Maybe that's what we do next week.  We just pick out a few guys to, you know.  Guys, yeah.  Even though people did say something to Patrice, we always feel like we could have said more.  But again, he knew.  He was the smartest guy in the room.  I mean, he always knew.  I can't be with him 24 hours either.  Yeah.  He was going to make his own decisions, and it's unfortunate.  They said even, look, with diabetes, even if you're totally thin and you jog, it can happen.  But by overeating and stuff, you just fucking put the odds through the roof. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, man.  You make it much worse.  See you tonight, brother.  It was good talking to you.  Thanks a lot.  All right, Chris.  Thank you, Chris.  Bye, Chris.  Chris Rock, everyone.  Yeah, that really did help Patrice, I think, when Chris, that day he was in, because it  got to him.  Because Chris wasn't coming at him like, you asshole.  He was like, I wanted to give you.  It was extremely real, remember?  Yeah.  And I think.  We were like, whoa.  And I think Patrice realized it.  And Patrice listened, too.  You know what?  One of the only times you've watched Patrice actually sit back and listen instead of coming back with  something.  He would do that on rare occasions when, and it was always when someone was being brutally 
[03:19:00]  honest with him.  He would actually stop talking and making fun of you for half a second.  But, yeah.  Yeah, it's terrible.  And it's, you know, look, everybody always says too soon when somebody dies.  It's a cliche thing to say.  But with Patrice, I've just never seen it more applicable.  This was such, you know, Giraldo was the first guy I knew in this business to go, and 
[03:19:30]  it was very upsetting.  But Patrice was the first.  I mean, I was friends with Greg, but Patrice was the first guy that I was really like,  holy shit, like, this can happen, man.  Like, you can go before, even though you're loved and respected and have so much to say and  are such a presence, you can go at any fucking time.  It's really scary, man, and it's so upsetting, because you know there was, like, seven more  of those specials there.  Welcome to middle age, Joe.  Yeah, no kidding.  Middle age is when you realize that life doesn't give a shit, that it just, it doesn't, you know? 
[03:20:00]  It's upsetting because he was young, but it's also, like you're saying, upsetting knowing  what he was about to do with his career.  It was like, you know, there was...  On both levels, it just sucks.  Yeah.  I so wanted to see that guy go to that, it was going to be a whole new group of people  who are going to meet him for the first time, which I tell you, I can't stress that enough,  watching somebody meet that guy.  When he was in that fucking mood, which he usually was, I just love how he used to pick  out...  I remember one time this beautiful girl came in and she had this little scar. 
[03:20:30]  You could barely fucking see it.  Oh, that motherfucker.  He went right for it.  Yeah.  He goes, how you doing?  Look at that scar you got right there, right?  And then immediately she's just all fucking uncomfortable and he just brought it to this  fucking real place that she, you know, hadn't probably been in since, you know, I don't  know what.  And he just, I don't know.  Did I tell that story about him talking, telling that girl to shut up?  That could be a thousand stories.  Is that at the cellar or no?  That time we were at the cellar and those girls were all talking, I think I told that 
[03:21:00]  when I called in.  I'll tell it again.  Who gives a fuck?  It don't matter.  So they're sitting there, you know, it's a loud bar and, you know, women, their voices  go up, it gets fucking, and he just goes, they're sitting there talking like, and he  keeps glancing over there as he's trying to talk to me.  And then he did that glance for an extra second.  I'm like, oh fuck, he's going to say something.  And he just picked out one.  He just goes, ma'am, miss, ma'am.  And she finally looks and she goes, what?  And he goes, your voice.  And she goes, is it loud? 
[03:21:30]  And he goes, it's piercing.  And he just starts and just basically tells her to shut up.  So then these girls are fucking gorgeous too.  So her two friends want to come to her rescue.  So all three of them come over to Patrice.  I'm like, oh fuck, how the hell is he going to deal with this?  And I don't know what he did.  Within 30 seconds, he had them auditioning to figure out who had the best sexy phone  sex voice.  Holy shit.  And they were auditioning for him.  And he was sitting there judging and telling each one of them why, despite their looks,  guys didn't find him attractive after like a third date. 
[03:22:00]  And he was so in there.  It was Hannibal Lecter.  He was in their fucking heads.  Hannibal Lecter.  It was awesome.  He was a psychologist, man.  He really was a brilliant, brilliant, intuitive fucking psychologist, man.  He just under, he read people immediately.  I know exactly the way, when you described that, how it went, your voice.  Yeah.  Like he would just do that.  Your voice.  Your voice.  What was better than him shushing people?  It's piercing.  What was funnier than that?  Oh, shh.  He used to do that.  He used to do that on the subway. 
[03:22:30]  It would be on the subway.  It would be jam-packed with people.  And he'd just go, shh.  And everyone would shut up for half a second.  And then he would just start laughing.  People would get so fucking mad.  And he was the one that brought that to the circle, right?  Him and Keith Robinson are the two.  Keith is a shush.  I've never heard that before.  His shush was so loud.  And he could do it so loud.  He could do it in bars and everybody would shut up.  And they all would look around like, where did that come from?  They don't realize why they're being shushed.  And you keep hearing people start going, who keeps doing that? 
[03:23:00]  Dude, I would beg him to do it at the cellar.  Because from the back of the room, I would be like, you shush, everybody.  It was like asking someone to sing your favorite song.  And he would finally shush.  And the whole fucking restaurant would go silent.  And he'd be like, why the fuck did we stop talking?  Who is that?  Who's shushing?  Dude, it's like, you got something on your shirt.  Like, the person would fall for it every fucking time.  That's so fucking funny.  I think one time I was going out to his house in Jersey.  We were way back in the day.  You know, we were struggling.  We were on the fucking path trade.  He did it like fucking nine times. 
[03:23:30]  To the point I was embarrassed going, please stop doing this.  Sorry.  You never say that to him, though.  He's going to just do it warm.  No, and then I think the entertainment was him watching me be so fucking uncomfortable.  Uncomfortable.  Yeah.  And he could diffuse almost anything, too.  Like, even though he was a big guy, he was so fucking, he just had that light, man.  He was so fucking charismatic.  He could diffuse any type of aggression.  Um, he just knew how to fucking let the air out and make people.  Manny had the same ability.  Manny Dwarman. 
[03:24:00]  No matter how heated it got, in a second, he could diffuse it, whatever.  Almost like that.  You know something?  That's what I loved about Manny the best.  Is because I came from that stupid Irish.  You get into a fight and then you hold on to it for fucking nine years.  He had that thing.  He had a, he had a, he could actually just make it be like that.  He'd come over you.  Hey.  And you just see that Manny laugh and you just start fucking laughing.  And then you start thinking, this is how we should have done it in my family.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Me and Manny had a fight one time.  One of our rare fights.  A real argument.  I might have told this story already, but Manny, I didn't go into the cellar for 40 days. 
[03:24:30]  I stayed out for over a month.  I was so fucking mad at him and he was mad at me.  And I finally went back in, um, because I just missed it.  And he and I walked by each other and we just kind of looked at each other and said, hello, hello.  And then we were just in the back and it was very tense when he was at the table with me.  Um, and he said, uh, he said, I have some, uh, pictures of you that I want, I want to give you that I took.  And I'm like, okay, thanks.  And he goes, let me go get them out of the garbage.  Immediately.  Immediately.  Immediately.  Everything was okay. 
[03:25:00]  He made me laugh.  Immediately.  He fucking just took the air.  That was another one.  That was another rough one.  Manny was the, and you know what I loved about Manny?  Manny, uh, Manny fucking, he loved, he loved people.  Like he loved the debate.  Like he loved sitting there and like, uh, so he didn't want to be mad at you.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like I learned a lot about not being an angry psycho just through that guy, like how he had  that ability.  And interestingly enough, Bobby Kelly living with Bobby Kelly. 
[03:25:30]  Bobby's really good at that.  After you have this epic.  I'm going to choke.  Yeah.  Really?  Choke you to death that he can actually, you know, yeah.  He starts going, listen, dude, bro.  And all that shit.  And he's like, give me this fucking idiot.  I can't be mad at him.  Yeah.  And Bobby, Bobby does the great thing too, where he'll go, uh, he'll be like, it's okay, dude.  I'm sorry.  I snapped at you.  Right.  And then like, he'll be talking to you, he'll go, he'll go, I mean, you know, nobody's  got to think about that.  You got all this fucked up shit that you do and it really pisses everybody off or whatever.  Like he'll slip it in. 
[03:26:00]  Oh man.  You'll just be going, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  And I'll go, I'm fucking with you, stupid.  You know?  And you're like, eh, you cocksucker.  Like the battered wife.  I worry about Bobby too with his eating.  I mean, we tease him and stuff because we're friends, but it's like, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  My friend.  It's like, you worry about it.  Dude.  I said that to him yesterday.  We went in for, we went in, he's going to kill me for telling this story, but we went  in to go get a fucking sandwich and, you know, I picked out this little bag of chips  and then he, and then he picks up this big bag of chips.  What's that?  Oh yeah. 
[03:26:30]  Please ignore it.  Okay.  It's better that way.  Big bag of fucking chips.  I go, Bobby, you don't need all those.  So then he grabbed like two little ones.  I go, put one of those back.  Two.  He grabbed two little ones.  Yeah.  I don't know what he's, uh, he, look, we were, we went the other day.  I made him walk with me to the Levi's store.  Uh, more fucking jeans.  I'm like, you're pants and jeans.  What are you, what are you doing?  What are you raping women and you're throwing jeans out in your face?  It's the jean killer.  I, um.  The blue jean killer.  Blue jean killer.  The Pepsi Cola rapist. 
[03:27:00]  For each trophy, he needs a new pair of jeans.  Ah, come on guys.  That's just dark.  Yeah.  He has a bunch of jeans with common blood.  Right.  Like a long blonde hair sample.  And it all came out of the same hole.  Uh, no, I, I made him walk.  I had to return some pants.  But seriously, folks.  I had to go for it.  I think, come on, I had to go for it.  I had to return some pants and, uh, I made him walk.  I was with him and Dawn or his wife for breakfast and, uh, and I'm, I go, I got to return some  pants.  Come with me. 
[03:27:30]  And his wife's like, yeah, you should go.  And we're walking and he's yelling at me.  Fucking stupid.  Cocksucker.  I want to.  And I go, dude, do you understand?  I care about you.  This is good that we're doing this.  And we went into Starbucks.  I'm like, don't get like, I'm not trashing him.  I'm like, don't get any fucking cookies, dude.  Like, I'm worried about you.  It's like watching.  Don't do it.  Because Bobby's a compulsive guy like I am with sex and like, you know, like everyone  is.  But he just, the food is such an addiction, man.  And it's a fucking hard one.  It's, it's hard because you cannot, we've talked about it, but you can't be fucking abstinent  from food.  Yeah.  You got to eat some. 
[03:28:00]  And it's like, uh, it's like, I worry about him.  Like, come on, dude.  Cause I, I took some, I sent some pictures of me, Bobby and Patrice from Brazil.  Um, you know, I was just going through some photos.  Was Bobby a lot thinner back then?  Yeah, man.  And it's like, he has the ability to get thin.  He really does.  Cause Bob's like a fucking, he could just lock onto like working out and work out.  You know, he can do it.  Yeah.  It's on or off with him.  Yeah.  I just want to see him do it for his own health.  It's like.  What is the theme from fat? 
[03:28:30]  So this is what he sees.  Whatever the fuck that is.  Yeah.  There you go.  Dude.  Dude.  I'm done with sugar, dude.  I'm fucking hitting your gin, dude.  Doing sit ups.  Dude.  Got a fucking ting, dude.  Dude, dude.  Got a weight loss app for my iPhone. 
[03:29:00]  Gonna get my fucking abs.  That last like.  He really is at that level of fat where he should just have the gray on gray sweatsuit from Sears.  Oh God, that's fucking.  All right.  Well, yeah.  Now that we expressed our concern, let's trash him.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, you gotta do it that way.  How come no concern for Roland?  That's a good point.  You know what? 
[03:29:30]  I love Roland.  Although Bobby's one of my closest friends.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah, yeah.  I've had, I've had sit downs with Roland.  He knows.  Yeah.  He knows.  He scares me.  Dude, food is fucking terrible.  He scares me.  Roland, I say.  Roland was just, when we were watching that baby calf get birth, uh, giving birth to, and his cute little calf face.  And Roland just goes, all I see is veal.  Hey, Roland.  What's up with you?  Roland's in my stress.  Oh, he blames us.  We don't like your Jets hat.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah. 
[03:30:00]  What's up with the Jets hat?  The new Jets hat.  What are you wearing that for?  Why are you wearing that?  It's fucking horrendous.  You don't have the right head for that.  Patrice would have looked great in that hat.  Yes, he would have.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Are you, uh, loving the Jets?  We're a little nervous with this, Sanchez.  Jets, New York Jets.  He did all right yesterday, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dude, the Jets can, they know how to win in the end, though.  They're 7-5.  I, uh, I wouldn't want to play those guys.  Packers are rough.  Oh, the Packers are great.  Packers are ridiculous, yeah.  The Niners, don't count them out.  No, the Niners, I think, if they had a quarterback. 
[03:30:30]  Is Drew Brees not good?  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, you're thinking, I'm thinking it's Sanchez.  Niners.  Well, let me put my two cents into this.  You don't like football.  No.  That a boy, Joe.  I'm telling you something.  On contrary, this guy.  It's a good year.  It's a good year for football, man.  I say, what did you say?  I mentioned Drew Brees, uh, because he did, but I was thinking it's Sanchez.  I haven't seen a player like Drew Brees since, uh, I would say Namath was the last time  I've seen somebody, like, play like Drew Brees.  Let me beat Bill.  Ah, Joe.  I'm very serious.  Ah, Joe.  I'm very serious.  Ah, Joe.  Who said that, Joe? 
[03:31:00]  You didn't hear the whole conversation.  Ah, Joe.  Who said that?  You're repeating it.  Drew Brees is.  Ah, Joe.  He's the old stuff.  Ah, shit.  All right.  I thought that was going to be fun.  What's the matter, Joe?  You tired of being left out of the conversation?  Yeah.  He's fun to do.  Yeah.  I kind of like the part.  It's really mean, but really true and funny.  You laugh and it hurts.  The eyes get real squinty.  Yeah.  Ah, Joe.  And he doesn't look at you.  He looks like, oh, it's not a Joe.  This one, too.  Jesus, Joe. 
[03:31:30]  Jesus.  Jesus.  Nice, long Jesus.  Yeah.  But just a fucking...  Ah, Jesus, Joe.  I can't tell you if you're doing me or an 80-year-old fucking vaudeville guy.  Vaudeville guy.  I really didn't have the reference.  I was trying to think of that.  What the hell did they be?  Poughkeepsie?  What the fuck did all those old Jewish guys go?  Oh, Catskills.  Catskills.  That was what I was looking for.  Old vaudeville guy.  I wanted to ask you, when you were telling that Patrice story about the animal thing,  and you said you wish you did that, was that before the Philly thing? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  Because you had your moment where you turned it in Philly.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, look, it's not like I hadn't snapped on crowds, but I was so, like, it was different.  It was a benefit.  And I was sitting there, and there was some people there.  Somebody from NBC was there.  So I was in this fucking...  So you felt like, you know what, even if I want to, I just can't go there.  I have to be a professional, and I felt like it was...  I made...  I basically kept giving them respect when they were showing me none. 
[03:32:30]  So I...  It was one of the worst feelings.  Now I understand.  That's what you just said.  It's not about...  You thought there was way too...  The people were way too important in the audience to, you know, fuck around.  Yeah, the cast from TV shows were there.  Gotcha.  Everyone was dressed up.  This was, you know, I didn't have, like, any sort of agent going.  Maybe somebody from CAA is here.  Like, I was in that stupid...  No, it was a great story.  Give me a deal.  It was a great story, but I was confused, because I'm like, nah, Bill would fucking do  that.  But now I get it.  Patrice addressed it the way you wished you had addressed it as a comic. 
[03:33:00]  Like, ah, he was being...  Yeah, I've been there, too.  And also, I grew into that.  Like, Patrice came in like that.  He came in like that.  He actually had to tone it down and remember to do material.  Standard equipment with him.  They should like you.  Yeah.  No, he, from day one, doing stand-up.  It was already there.  It took me...  It took me years.  And, you know, obviously getting to see a guy his caliber, it was, you know...  Ah, it's the worst, saddest fucking day ever.  We've talked about his big, dumb laugh. 
[03:33:30]  But anybody that thinks Patrice was mean, when you made him laugh like that, like, you  really felt like a funny person.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was like, when he fucking let go.  Like, that's the guy I think of when I think of Patrice.  Not mean, or...  And people have had horrible experiences with him, because he...  He was at times fucking...  Believe me, there's a lot of people not sad today.  I said there's as many happy as sad.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he was mean to certain comics unnecessarily.  And, you know, look, at one point he went back and started apologizing to guys, because  he felt bad about the interactions he had had.  Like, he has a conscience.  But he gave you respect, man. 
[03:34:00]  You know, he gave you that over-the-top laugh saying, fuck, that was funny.  Something was funny.  Yeah, yeah.  I think one of the hardest I saw anybody make him laugh was the time Voss did that bit.  Hey, you know, what time is it?  There was this Asian guy walking down the street, like, you know, he's in the middle  of moving, and he had all these boxes.  And the joke is, you basically go, hey, what time is it?  And as the guy looks down at the watch, you walk away.  Sure.  And just the look of exasperation, because the guy had to adjust the weight of the boxes.  Like, I thought Patrice was going to fall down.  Was that in front of Voss?  The Voss, remember that?  And he was, he, like, he actually started running. 
[03:34:30]  He was laughing so hard.  Can you imagine?  Trying to run away from the laugh.  He ran, like, five feet.  From his own laugh.  And, like, leaned on this car and was laughing so hard.  And the laugh was so great.  I remember thinking, like, I wish I could make him laugh that hard.  Yeah, yeah.  And then it was, you know, it was out there in the streets.  It was echoing off the buildings.  It was just, it just was fucking, it was awesome.  Yeah, any time you made him laugh, it was just fucking gold.  It's like, oh, man, okay, good.  Patrice is laughing?  Fuck.  I can be, I can be funny at some point.  The impish smile, too.  You're right. 
[03:35:00]  That impish, there was that fucking, that weird, like, I know I'm being naughty.  Fucking smile.  He knew exactly what he was doing at all fucking times.  And his disdain for authority, I fucking.  Fantastic.  I loved it.  Yeah.  I fuck.  I remember one time we would drive, we used to drive down to New York in my piece of shit  truck.  I had this 83 Ford Ranger vinyl seats.  You know, he leaned all the way to one side because he's like a barely shift a thing.  Right.  And I remember getting, we got pulled over by the cops and I'm just typical white guy.  I'm like, I was speeding. 
[03:35:30]  He got me.  Fuck it.  And I'm sitting there next to him.  The guy comes to the window.  I just see, I can feel Patrice staring a hole through this guy to the point.  And I'm like, I'm going to get this shit kicked out of me because of you.  Yeah, because of this.  I was speeding.  The speed limit was fucking 55.  I was doing 75.  Stop staring at this guy.  And Patrice goes, he had like this whole coat of armor.  It's the way.  It's the way he's talking to you right now.  Oh, man.  I fucking hate these cops.  And then it became this whole topic of race on the way down that I don't get it.  And I was just like, dude, you know, they're kind of dicks to us too. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they also have to come up to the car and be worried that they're not going to get shot.  So they have to have, so I was obviously taking the cop side and it was just like, I remember  I had no saliva left in my mouth by like five, you know, you could just out debate you.  I think we just stopped talking by the time we got there.  But we had this one moment on the trip that we always got a big kick out of.  There's this tunnel that you go through on the Merritt Parkway.  And we used to always joke that it was this James Bond kind of tunnel.  So one time we were going down there through there and he actually brought the James Brown, 
[03:36:30]  James Bond, James Bond soundtrack cassette.  This is how long it is.  And he popped it in and right as we go to the tunnel, I was like, and we were driving  through.  And then when it went, we both looked at each other.  We were in a spine.  It became like, it became this fucking tradition.  Every time we drove down, we'd be in the middle of talking.  We both knew we were going to do it.  Nobody said anything.  And then we would, one time we were driving down with Bobby Kelly and that was the best  because he had no idea.  And we were sitting there talking and, you know, Patrice, these motherfuckers. 
[03:37:00]  And we got to the bridge and then we go, shut up, Bob.  So we popped it in and it's like going down and down and just starts doing that high  pitch laugh.  What the fuck?  And then we just looked at each other, came out the other side and it was, Bobby laughed  for like 10 miles.  It was fucking, it was, it was awesome.  It was, it was fucking, we had so many, so many great times, man.  He told me about you guys doing that recently and he was telling me, he goes, he goes, dude,  they would drive through the tunnel, dude.  And as soon as they hit the tunnel, they go, and I go, what the fuck are you talking? 
[03:37:30]  What are you singing?  And he goes, James Bond, dude.  No, we had it down and right where it would go, we'd both look at each other.  You gotta look at each other.  And then when it was like, it was like, we'd look away back and go, that's fucking cool.  That's hilarious.  That's awesome.  It's like a movie.  Yeah.  And when Bobby saw it, dude, I'm telling you, he laughed for fucking 10 miles going,  what the fuck is wrong with you guys?  And it was, uh, it was awesome.  And then we went down to New York and me and Bobby felt like little kids and Patrice just 
[03:38:00]  walked in and immediately started trashing the club owners.  And I, I was just, I remember thinking like, how does he think he's going to get in doing  this?  And then he would, because he just had the, he would literally de-pants these guys and  they were just like, they're so used to being like everybody just groveling and Patrice  would just come in and just, you know, bring them down to bedrock.  You can back any shit up with charm and charisma, which is fucking like, no one has both of  those things where you can be a utter prick and then be charming. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  Well, we have the prick part, but that charming part, we're all a little lacking.  We're working on it.  But he was funny.  He was almost funny at will.  And that was what got him out of it was because you couldn't argue that this guy is not hilarious.  Like everyone, you couldn't, he, uncomfortable situations.  He can make people laugh at him all the time.  Like just start to start trashing somebody where nobody knows him.  He didn't care.  He didn't give a fuck.  And then people would listen and start laughing.  I saw him.  He trashed one time. 
[03:39:00]  We were at Montreal comedy festival and the original star of law and order, really well  respected actor.  He passed away.  He came walking up and I was like all in awe and Patrice started making fun of his fucking  raincoat.  And the guy loved it.  He just like, he immediately got that.  Orbach guy.  Yeah.  The old guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jerry.  Who literally looked like, I think it's Jerry.  Yeah.  And that was the thing.  Like when people immediately got Patrice, like that was, that was another, like a whole  nother level.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause then you immediately saw, Oh, I bet this guy breaks balls too.  Like he totally, he didn't have like a, that vibe. 
[03:39:30]  Like I'm the star of a TV show.  He immediately thought it was fucking funny.  And then I, then Patrice had that thing that like, that's how people didn't realize that's  how you got to him.  That if you actually could laugh at a trash and that, then you'd get that, that side of  Patrice where he, he showed you what a big hearted guy he was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  God damn.  Oh, and it just gets sadder by each story.  It, it really does.  Fucking horrible.  There was some wonderful, savage beatings, some fucking verbal beatings.  And we've all been on the receiving end of them and I don't think I ever got over that, 
[03:40:00]  that bus beating about taking the bus, you know, and Kevin and them came in and told that  story.  And this is what I never told because I was sworn to secrecy.  I got, after that trashing, I was still going to do the gig because in my world, it  was an easy gig.  Just to tell the listeners, it was basically, you had to do stand up on a bus to Yankee Stadium  and they, they pay like 500 bucks and you get a free world series ticket and they were  all Braves fans.  So I'm like, that's the easiest fucking gig ever.  All I got to do is just stand there.  Every time I have a problem, I go, Jeter sucks. 
[03:40:30]  Hey, look at the tits on her and I would be fine.  But they pounded me so bad for 45 minutes.  I was still going to do it because I didn't give a fuck.  But in the end, Patrice said, he said, Bill, you're a friend.  He goes, I can't let you do that.  He goes, I will stand in front of that bus before I let you do that.  He goes, you, you make enough money.  Just buy a fucking ticket if you want to go.  And I just remember that going like, oh, I should really have some sort of respect for  myself and that's what made me stop. 
[03:41:00]  And then I, this is where I was sworn to secrecy is I passed that gig on to somebody else and  they did the gig.  I'll let them tell it if they ever come on this show.  And I asked them the next day, I go, I go, I go, how was the game?  He goes, oh, it was fucking awesome.  I go, I go, how about the, how was the gig?  He goes, dude, it was brutal.  He goes, I ran out of shit.  We hit traffic.  Oh, no.  Traffic.  I didn't take into consideration there was going to be traffic going to a World Series game  at the Bronx.  You had to perform for the whole ride, no matter how long the ride lasted. 
[03:41:30]  It wasn't like you're on 10.  I don't think Patrice was ever, was ever funnier.  He said, he goes, so when they bring you up, are you going to come out of the bathroom?  Or he goes, are you going to walk up those little stairs?  One of my favorite ones, he said, he goes, he was doing an impression of me after, at  the end of the end of the gig, I was going to be standing up going like, this is going  to be a visual joke, but, you know, thanks a lot, everybody.  You guys have been great.  And then I sit down with my back to the crowd and as they all get off, I'm looking over my 
[03:42:00]  shoulder going, oh, thanks a lot.  And it was just one of those things.  It was the easiest thing to trash somebody for.  And then all the fucking Mount Rushmore people of trashing, Norton was there, Voss was there,  Keith was there, Patrice and Little Kev.  Oh, shit.  Dude, and two of them, I never, I never would have come.  They literally did a headlining set and it was one of those awful nights at the cellar  where there was only, it was like, like a third full. 
[03:42:30]  So there was, people who didn't even know me were hearing it and they were either laughing.  One girl looked at me and she went, oh, she saw me.  Dude, and I just was sitting at the bar shifting my weight and all I wanted to do from 30 seconds  in was run out of there.  And I just, I couldn't, I had to sit because that's the rules.  I had to sit there and take it through.  And every time I thought it was going to end, somebody else would just come back with something else.  And it just, dude, I'm telling you, that one, the Eddie Ift.  Oh, my God. 
[03:43:00]  That was one, were you there for that?  It was when Patrice, a comedian, Eddie Ift, who's a funny guy, but Patrice killed him one time.  They argued about something.  And it was so bad.  Me and Voss were there.  And like, literally, we didn't even, you didn't want to jump in on a teasing.  We couldn't even jump in on a teasing.  It felt abusive, almost, to jump in.  Wow.  Somebody jumped in that we need to call him to make sure he's okay.  Eddie, I actually, out of everything we said, summed up Patrice in a great way.  One time he goes, sometimes I would walk into the cellar and I would just think, fuck, he saw me. 
[03:43:30]  Which I thought was exact, because I used to feel that.  I used to feel that.  Like, you would come walking in and you would literally, like, dude, before you'd walk in,  you'd look at your clothes going, okay, is everything straight?  Is my head?  Is my hair messed up?  They're going to fucking rail me about this one really bad.  I have closets full of clothes that got retired from the trashing.  And I've got to be honest, dude, like, as much as I do that shit on stage, I'm not that guy off stage.  Like, Norton and those guys really were those guys.  And I used to really take a fucking pounding down there. 
[03:44:00]  He was trashing some guy's hoodie one night.  I forget who the comic was.  We were in front of the cellar.  And Patrice was trashing his hoodie so bad.  And he's going, look at this nigga's hoodie.  Look at this nigga's hoodie.  Right?  And he goes, he goes, take that shit off, man.  Take that fucking hoodie off.  And the dude unzipped it.  And he was wearing, like, a spandex shirt underneath.  And he goes, put it the fuck back on.  Put it back on, man.  And it was, like, so fucking fast and so insulting. 
[03:44:30]  Like, boom, boom, boom, boom.  We were laughing so fucking hard.  I love what he used to call, like, older white people the N-word.  When he was mad at them, and he would talk to them like it was some dude on the street.  And they, they, so he would be coming at them, like, 40 different ways that they did not handle.  You could only see their clothes moving and the pounding that they were taking from the guy.  And, uh, totally, man.  I never said that, dude.  Now that everybody's fucking dropping.  Outmost respect for, like, the quickness you get, Norton has.  And all those guys, man, they're just fucking, really, uh... 
[03:45:00]  One of my best laughs I ever had was on this show when you called somebody a zilch.  And I literally, the way he said it, I swear to God, like, three weeks later, I was eating, like, raisin bran.  And the shit came out of my nose.  I don't know why I was thinking it.  I think because you were eating, like, a breakfast sandwich.  I was eating breakfast.  There was some sort of fucked up connection.  I was sitting there with...  And I was eating fucking something.  I just saw...  He went on, you know, one of those Norton rants.  Yeah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Fucking zilch, right?  Shit just came out of my nose, so...  Thanks, man.  I don't know.  Seriously, dude. 
[03:45:30]  Dude, it was the most...  It was the most...  Moving up to the city with you guys already being...  It was one of the most intimidating things you could ever do.  Because you walk into the...  You know, you come from the open mic scene in Philly.  And you...  All of a sudden, you're like, it's your first night in New York.  You walk into the cellar.  It's Norton, Burr, Patrice, Bobby, Voss, DePaulo, Keith, Giraldo, Giraldo.  Oh, I forgot DePaulo.  And you're just like, you know, it's that we're not in Kansas moment, not to use a cliche,  but I mean, it's like, you know, and just watching that, you're just like, I better 
[03:46:00]  shut the fuck up.  Yeah, don't talk.  Dude, I gotta tell you something.  The amount of comics who came down there and took one ass beating and just hit out up at  the Strip and the fucking stand-up New York for the rest of their time there.  And just never fucking came back.  Never came back down, dude.  Like, it was a serious caning, and the thing is, you never really got beaten into the  gang.  It just continued to happen.  I remember nights, even Keith, remember that night, Keith was wearing something, and somebody 
[03:46:30]  got him with something so funny, he literally stood up.  That's how I got the idea.  He literally stood up and ran out of there, and I remember thinking about that buzz pounding  going, why the fuck didn't I ever think that you had to run out?  Why didn't I just sit here and take it?  Sometimes you gotta just leave, like when you feel the roll starting and you gotta go,  oh, you're like, I'm out, I bailed a few.  No way, right?  Yeah.  But the worst is when, like, Artie, Artie will, like, they got smart, the guy's trying  to run out, and they'll block you, like you'll try to dash out of the fucking spot.  Where the fuck are you going? 
[03:47:00]  Sit there and take your fucking pounding.  Who got me mad one time?  I was when I was opening for Dice, it was probably 99 or 2000, and I was at the cellar,  and they were killing me for, probably for opening for, you know, whatever they were doing.  Yeah, Patrice, Patrice was killing you, what was he saying?  I don't remember.  Oh, he was saying how much of a lackey Norton was to fucking Dice.  So he started imitating Dice, calling Jim up, going, hey, let's go to the mall.  Oh! 
[03:47:30]  And it was, dude, fucking pounding the table.  Dude, that was a great smashing.  And I was overtired, because I used to fly home in the morning and land at, like, 6 p.m.  and then go right to the cellar, because it was before, obviously, the morning radio.  And I'm sitting there, I think it was Patrice that pulled my chair out, and I was like,  don't touch my fucking chair.  Like, that's when I decided to get indignant and angry.  Oh, now you're standing up.  Yeah, I made it real, like, don't touch my fucking chair, and that just made the pounding  worse.  It just made my beating worse, and I had to take it. 
[03:48:00]  Jesus.  Dude, I remember, like, times of, like, trying to sneak out of there, and you just, literally,  Keith would be like, where you going, Burr?  You got nowhere to go.  Sit down.  You got nowhere to go.  And then you're, like, an idiot trying to make something up.  I got it, y'all.  You got an audition for what, stupid?  You're not getting it.  Nobody cares.  Shut the fuck up.  Oh, fucking brutal.  Sometimes when you're getting beat up, it was fun, though.  Like, I literally have been killed by those guys, and you're thinking, like, it is fun,  because I know I'm loved here, and I'm getting pounded by some of the funniest fucking 
[03:48:30]  guys in the country.  It was kind of a weird thing to enjoy, like, even when you were getting killed.  Yeah, I only saw, you only, he only, I got upset a lot.  He only got upset a couple of times, but I don't remember what time, like, he was always  good nature.  I met a time Jim was playing chess with Bobby.  Bobby's on the phone, too.  And, uh, fucking, uh, Patrice was just being, just fucking with Norton, and he goes, uh,  he goes, Jim, what would you do if I punched you, what'd you do if I punched you right  in this chin right here?  And then he just started, and he just started, I don't know, I just watched him the way Jim 
[03:49:00]  was laughing, I literally learned from you guys, because I came from such an angry background  where it wasn't done with any sort of love.  That's why I sucked at that game, because I didn't take it in love, and then I also went  right for your jug, I was the guy, literally, yeah, at least my mom didn't die.  That's how I initially played it, so it took me the, just took everyone out of it, wrecked  the whole thing, yeah, the whole fucking, Bobby was like that, too, like, but Bobby  had a way of saving it, where Bobby would go for the jugular, and then, then everybody  would be like, Jesus Christ, and just go, Bob Kelly. 
[03:49:30]  Bobby's on the line.  I butchered it, sorry.  Bobby.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing, Bobby?  How you doing, Bobby?  Bobby.  I was at that pounding, too, bus bill.  Are you there for that one?  I'm sorry.  You come up to the front, the yellow line, and that's the stage.  The yellow line!  I don't know, Bob, I gotta admit, it was all kind of a blur, you know?  I still have brain damage from that one.  That was an, that was one of the, we went over it one night, but I remember Patricia's 
[03:50:00]  at the cellar, and that's so funny, that he got kicked out of the cellar, and then back  in, and then he just refused to play there.  Dude, I heard, I didn't, I wasn't there for this one, but one, an epic one, Bobby got off  easy, because it was overseas, so none of us saw us.  There was something in Amsterdam about a hotel room, you guys went over to do a gig over  there, was you, Keith, and Patrice?  Well, I, you know, yeah, it was Keith and Patrice and me, and it was, uh, they put us,  they tried to put us in this, you know, boutique hotel right in the red light district, but 
[03:50:30]  it was really just like, you know, a flop house to save money, and, you know, Patrice  and Keith flipped out, and I was just wanting to be a people pleaser, so they have me back  to Amsterdam, and I'm like, it's not so bad, and, uh, yeah, it had, like, it had, it was  a square room, four metal bunk beds, and it had a, a five-by-five window.  It's a hostel.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, they complained, and I didn't. 
[03:51:00]  I told the guy, I'm fine, this is great, I'm, I'm cool here, and the guy was lying to him,  like, yeah, it's 30 minutes away, and blah, blah, blah, trying to get him not to go, they're  like, fuck you, pick us up, we're out of here.  They left.  It wound up only being 10 minutes away.  It was the nicest hotel ever that they put Patrice and Keith on, and I had to spend the  night by myself in this fucking hostel.  I was fucking shitting my pants, and then the next day I come out to get in the van as 
[03:51:30]  they're picking me up to go to the show, I had bought a black shirt and black polyester  pants, but I didn't know that I bought bell bottoms.  Oh, no.  So I came out, I came out of the hostel, and it looked like I had a fucking black evening  gown on.  The pounding, the pounding that went on in that van, I'm not even kidding you, it was  so brutal and so rapid fire between Keith, and you know, Keith's laugh, and Patrice's 
[03:52:00]  laugh, not only did Patrice hit you with a fucking crazy fucked up, just right on the  money slam, his laugh just mushed it into your face.  Oh, and drowned out anything you had coming back with?  There's nothing you could, his laugh was like the extra just foot on the face in the  mud.  And I remember the guy, Franz, who didn't laugh at us all week, thought we were assholes,  had to pull the fucking van over.  He was laughing so hard. 
[03:52:30]  This is a French guy, too.  I don't think he understood English that well.  So then, I'm going to be honest with you, I had a tear in my eye, like I welled up.  Honestly, honest to God, sometimes I got pounded by these guys, because it's hard to fucking  take somebody, because they're being so honest with you.  I look like I got raped, and I was somebody's bitch in prison.  I mean, and I fucked up, and I was so scared to walk out of that hotel with my fucking bell 
[03:53:00]  bottoms on.  Your evening gown.  And then the fact that they didn't even give me a second, you know, there's some comics  you'd be like, hey, what's up, man?  Nice pants.  And they just talk about you behind your back.  None of our crew would do that.  It was sometimes that hurt so bad that you, I mean, dude, I literally had tears in my eyes.  They told me, Bob, they told me that they actually invited you over to their great hotel  that they stayed at, and then you came walking in and acted like you were going to stay there,  and they didn't let you.  They made you go back to your flop house.  And he said, after the thing, Patrice looked back and saw me. 
[03:53:30]  My feelings were hurt.  He saw that I was legitimately, my feelings were hurt.  And he goes, Bobby, you can come with us tonight.  And I go, I go, can I?  He goes, absolutely not, stupid.  I was listening before with the, uh, the weight stuff, and I really, it just, it really bugs  me to no end that Joe DeRosa is fucking saying that I need more help than him.  The fact that he looks like his body is any character out of a Dr. Seuss book. 
[03:54:00]  Joe really is the wild card.  Like, Bobby's the obvious choice.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, when you gamble, you always got to bet, you always got to pick a couple of upsets  if you want to go undefeated on the card.  He's the pass line.  Yeah.  On the point.  Yeah, you're still on the board, dude.  I'm telling you.  And don't forget about that fucking lunatic sitting next to you with the megaphone in  front of him. 
[03:54:30]  Who, Antley?  Who, me?  Antley?  We're going to save you, too, you fucking Howard Hughes.  He's not going to come out of his house one day.  Well, I like my house.  Jesus Christ.  How are they going to find you?  I like my house, my beers, and my guns.  How and where are they going to find you in that house when it all goes down?  Jesus.  I say in the...  Let's see.  That was a logical question.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Who's going to be brave enough to go into the house?  Wait, wait, wait.  Here we go.  Here we go.  What do you got, Bob?  It's going to be in the hot tub. 
[03:55:00]  There's going to be two young girls dead with him.  Exactly.  And there's going to be...  He's going to have his 50 cal.  Going out like a legend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anthony's going to be the first person where it's literally from my cold, dead hand.  He's going to be dead with the fucking gun.  It's going to involve some sort of barricade.  When you barricade it into your own house, the word estranged is going to be used.  The first, former, a lot of... 
[03:55:30]  It's going down like that.  Yes, yes.  History of...  History of...  Yeah.  You're going to find him in some room.  All kinds of things.  Some room behind a three-foot iron door.  Sometimes with canned food in it.  Sometimes controversial.  God damn it.  I hope he's going to go in a park.  I just see him feeding birds and just keen on...  He's going to last a while.  He's going to last a while.  But like Michael Corleone at the end.  Yeah, he's going to go like Michael Corleone. 
[03:56:00]  Of three.  Hold the chest.  At least that one you live long.  Yeah.  That's a good scenario.  What the fuck?  Obi's going to go learn Tai Chi in China.  Oh, right then.  I guess you're going to go home.  Tai Chi.  Why don't you try taping it, right?  Is it something, Bob?  Fucking chip.  Where is he going to go?  Bobby, you missed the John Jones interview, and Jimmy took a pretty good fucking hit today.  Really?  Why?  What happened?  Well, you know how Jimmy likes to try out some of this shit. 
[03:56:30]  John was great, and he gave me a...  A shin kick to the thigh.  A shin kick to my upper right thigh.  And Jim Norton's color left his body.  Wait a minute, dude.  I'm so sorry I didn't make it in.  I had some problems late last night.  He fucking...  Dude, it was so bad.  Can I just tell you what a fucking moron I am, Jimmy?  What?  You said yesterday, Jim Jones is coming in.  You got to...  John Jones is coming in.  Who's that fucking...  I thought you meant Tom Jones, the singer. 
[03:57:00]  That's different.  You kept saying, you're going to come in tomorrow.  You're going to come in.  I'm like, all right, all right.  I was like, I don't give a fuck about Tom Jones.  Yeah, it was Johnny Bones.  Johnny Bones.  I didn't know it was John Jones.  I'm a fucking moron.  Dude, he gave me a fucking...  That was funny when Bob goes, why?  Why would Tom Jones kick you?  Um...  That's a good question.  It's like a David Lee Roth kind of showbiz kick.  Dude, there's a...  Yeah, it was like a can-can fucking thing.  That really is the difference between me and Bob, too, because when he said Tom Jones, 
[03:57:30]  I literally was like, ooh, that would be exciting.  Opie Twittered it, and I retweeted it, dude.  He kicked me, and there's a better video of it going up.  Sam has a better video.  He gave me a shin kick to my upper right thigh.  It hurt so...  I literally couldn't breathe, and then I had to leave the studio because I thought I was  going to throw up.  It was a shock to my system.  I almost fainted from the kick.  His color was fucked up.  I almost fainted.  I had to walk...  Why?  Why?  Why are you into this?  Why? 
[03:58:00]  That one I would never do again, like...  It was a masochistic thing.  No, but it's not that.  It's just...  What fan wouldn't want to?  You get a chance...  Well, every other fan...  It's like taking a catch from Peyton Manning, a fucking Staubach.  Every time I sit here going, maybe I'll...  Nah.  Nah.  Fuck that.  I want to see if I'm a bruiser.  It would make you kind of want to do it for a second, and then you realize, nah.  Nah.  No way.  How big is he?  Dude, he's a fucking...  He literally is sculpted out of human tissue.  He's got to be 6'5", right?  Right.  He's deceptively massive because he's so tall. 
[03:58:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, he's...  And he's a really sweet guy, too.  A really nice guy, right?  Real nice.  He smiles live, which would really suck when he's beating the shit out of you.  Oh.  Jesus, Bob.  He would probably keep smiling.  But he doesn't smile when he fights, man.  No.  They were showing clips on TV before of his fucking...  Some of those spinning elbows, and I just...  I don't understand how people get up to take that.  I don't comprehend how a man can take that to his face.  Yeah, that's the worst person is that the...  You know, because he's a Christian, too.  He really believes in God and, you know, that other side of those people.  Yeah.  You know? 
[03:59:00]  Oh, that's why he brought up Tim Tebow, I guess.  How's your leg, Jimmy?  I'm trying to see...  I've been icing it, too, because, as per Kenny, he's no bruise yet.  Yeah, he's a monster.  He's going to be a heavy one.  His fucking little midget Schwarzenegger legs are hilarious.  Tim Norton really is in fucking shape.  Those legs are ridiculous.  From the waist down, he is.  From the waist up, I literally look like I was just pulled off a clay table.  Why do you have legs that are sculpted?  I don't know.  You know how hard it is to bend down in a meat-hacking district? 
[03:59:30]  It makes no sense.  It doesn't make sense.  Yes, you're right.  You have calf muscles that, like bodybuilders, would kill for...  His belt is too tight and all the fat can't sit...  It's so bizarre.  I really do.  They fucking...  They rolling pin my feet up to my cock and balls and I belt it off.  And then his thighs are sculpted, too, man.  Yeah, I have very good thighs.  It's like a balloon animal that they squeeze the legs and everything just...  I'm an unfinished sculptor.  You're exactly right.  You don't walk. 
[04:00:00]  You work out every once in a while.  Yeah, elliptical three times in a row.  Then you treat yourself.  Oh, yeah.  It's very strange.  No, that's genetics, dude.  It is.  Yeah.  I used to hate those guys in the gym.  They'd lift once and they're ripped.  I was like, what?  What is that about?  Come on.  Why did you not get shit for that?  Because he knew I meant it as a horrible...  We got a really busy day.  We got to wrap up.  I would never say that.  I'll talk to you guys later, man.  We'll see you in a while later.  All right, guys.  I love you guys.  All right, buddy.  We'll love you.  Take care of yourself.  Bye, everybody, everybody.  Bill, what do you got?  Anything? 
[04:00:30]  Bye, buddy.  Podcast?  Anything you want to promote?  I'm here for the trees.  That's it.  No, I know that.  That's it.  Might as well at least get a plug in.  What the fuck?  Dude, you know what?  I wanted to tell you.  Remember those tweets?  Was I showing you those last nights?  The fucking tweets I got from some people?  Like how showbiz never ends.  Hey, Bill, sorry to hear about Patrice.  I know he's a real good friend of you.  Listen, I just opened this room in Reno.  It's a 300-seater.  Oh, God.  I got a couple of those.  Sorry about Patrice.  Hey, can you do me a favor?  Do you have Kevin Hart's number?  Yeah, yeah.  I'd really like to...  Using your grief to segue into something. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah.  Some asshole fucking...  Now, look, this is hearsay, so if it's not true, fine.  But if it is true, you're a fucking cunt.  But some comic, female comic from L.A., supposedly tweeted, like, when he died, like, you know,  rest in peace, Patrice, something along those lines.  And then, like, but I'll be at the such and such, you know, like, and plugged her fucking  gig off of his...  MTV.com did that.  Fucking asshole.  Really?  MTV.com did, uh, they said, uh, they said, and this is, I'm not making fun of any of these  people.  It's just who they chose to retweet.  Uh-huh.  They said, like, uh, Charlie Sheen, Aziz, Sarah Silverman, and Nick Cannon all grieved the 
[04:01:30]  loss of their good friend, Patrice O'Neal.  I'm just thinking, did we not have enough credits?  And then at the bottom, it said, uh, uh, Vinny from Jersey Shore, uh, said it's going  to be a huge loss to the comedy world.  So they actually used Patrice's death as a way to cross-promote...  Cross-promote Jersey Shore.  ...Jersey Shore.  That's fucking believable.  Come on, dude.  Oh, my God.  And Patrice would have laughed his ass off at that.  Of course.  Yes.  He would have laughed at that.  Blown off his real friends.  Yeah, he would have actually enjoyed... 
[04:02:00]  What the fuck?  He actually would have enjoyed our subtle humiliation at that.  Yes.  That's when you get stupid.  You're not famous enough.  Yeah, he would have really berated us.  What about Piers Morgan, thinking, uh, Patrice was a girl?  That happened his whole fucking career.  I remember I did...  Yeah, but Piers is, like, selling it, like, oh, this is a tragedy.  She's going to be missed.  She was so this.  She was that.  Yeah, but you knew that.  You know when the...  Jim Norton is the only guy I've ever seen actually reads the book before the author comes in  and then apologizes and says, I'm only up to page fucking 201.  Yeah, I'm sorry. 
[04:02:30]  The other of them just go, like, you know, this book is just, you know, the...  I thought it...  I just thought...  The back cover, yeah.  Yeah.  They don't...  I thought Piers was just a little different than the rest of them.  Like, you...  I don't know.  Right, more thoughtful, maybe?  Yeah, man.  We had him in, and in the end, he's just like the rest of these schmucks.  He was fun.  He was a fun guy to hang with for an hour.  He didn't fucking know him.  And may believe he did.  Joe, let's not promote Caroline's, then.  This is about Patrice.  Sorry.  You'll have to come back and promote that you're going to be at Caroline's, the 14th,  15th, and 18th.  You wouldn't want to do that, Joe.  We can't do it today.  Joe, you can't do it today.  You're too much of a man, Joe.  Please, please. 
[04:03:00]  Don't mention the House of Comedy in Minneapolis.  No, don't do it.  Not today.  No, no, no.  Not today.  But any other day, you're more than...  Out of respect for Patrice.  Yeah, yeah.  Out of respect for Patrice, I will say this.  I will be in Doylestown this Friday and Saturday, and not only should you come, you should buy my merchandise.  Why?  It's what he would have wanted.  That's right.  There you go.  That's true.  And E-Rock has, like, bonus Patrice stuff.  Another five hours of Patrice tomorrow that he couldn't fit in the weekend special, so  that's going to be great.  And we'll see you guys when we play. 
[04:03:30]  I just want to tell you about some big news, though.  Porn sites are moving from the .com to the .XX.  Yes.  You know how difficult it is getting a .com name these days?  Patrice loved porn.  Yeah.  If you're going to start a .com porn site, it's almost impossible to find a memorable name  that hasn't been taken already by someone else.

[04:07:30]  Serious XXX.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the O.P. and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Hello! I just started the show.  There's a button on the board that says, Sam.  I'm Sam, so I pushed the button, not realizing it would turn the microphone on in the space where I usually sit.  So I just said hello into a microphone that wasn't on because I have to hit Opie when I'm doing After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[04:08:00]  Which is, by the way, mistakes and all, brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms.  Trojan, America's number one most trusted condom brand.  A really great show today.  Bill Burr, Joe DeRosa in.  We talked to John Bones Jones.  Chris Rock called in again.  Again, I mean, we've said this every day for the last four or five days, but really giving you an idea of the amount of people who felt like Patrice had impacted their lives. 
[04:08:30]  Chris Rock doesn't get much bigger than him in comedy right now.  He called in to talk about how much he loved Patrice and some of the sabotage that Patrice did to himself.  Now, the special, phenomenal job by the sex man Eric Nagel, the Patrice special over the weekend, I heard nothing but good things about other than Troy at one point introduced Kurt Metzger, which is, I believe, Roland speak for Kurt Metzger.  Beyond that, I heard, I mean, just nothing but fantastic things. 
[04:09:00]  Did you hear any of the special?  I couldn't listen to it, to tell you the truth.  I tried, even though I built it, I tried to ignore it as well, and Saturday when we were getting into the car, we were leaving from the place that we were at.  My wife had our channel on, and it was right when Warren Haynes started speaking.  Yeah, so I quickly went off.  I had to turn it off.  Yeah, I mean, I was on the road, too, this weekend. 
[04:09:30]  I went to Philly for a wrestling convention of all the terrible things.  It was chronicled on my Twitter, but I couldn't, I couldn't, I was listening to other stuff.  I turned Howard on or something.  I couldn't listen to, oh, you said it.  I couldn't listen to the Patrice special.  But the Chris Rock thing where Chris was kind of convincing Patrice that he needed to shape up and show business and explaining why he lost the role on Everybody Hates Chris.  That's going to be, that wasn't part of the special, but it will be on tomorrow. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah, while we were building all this, we thought, you know, there was a chance on Friday that Chris might call in, and I was saving it, and it didn't, and then it worked out for this time.  Yeah.  So I'm going to mix what Chris did today with that old segment.  Well, good.  I mean, it'll sound good.  And, you know, nobody got tired of it, so definitely look forward to tomorrow morning.  It's the bonus Patrice tribute.  Another five full hours of stuff that you have not heard yet.  Five more hours, on top of the 16 we aired this weekend, five new hours of Patrice material. 
[04:10:30]  Also, I was talking about Joe DeRosa was in here.  If you guys are going to buy tickets to see DeRosa at Caroline's this weekend, they just set up a code.  The promo code is O&A.  It's all lowercase.  Letter O, A, and D, letter A.  O and A.  And you can get, the tickets are $18 to see DeRosa, which is cheap already.  This is a pre-sale?  Yeah.  I don't think it's at Caroline's.  Just a regular?  Yeah.  Okay.  But if, it's just at Caroline's.com. 
[04:11:00]  It's not a big deal.  But tickets are $18.  If you put in the promo code, it's $10.  So the promo code is O&A, all lowercase.  $10 tickets to see Joe DeRosa.  It's at Caroline's.com.  Just make sure you put in the promo code, and you'll be able to see him.  I also need to talk to you about Argentium.  What?  Yeah, that's right.  Are you asking what it is?  I'll tell you.  No, I'm saying, like, again.  Argentium, you see, is Steven Singer's new super silver collection.  That's right.

We were talking about John Bones Jones.  Yes.  The video, Opie hit it from one angle, the kick. 
[04:12:30]  He kicked Norton right in the shin.  It's hilarious.  Opie's phone video is already up.  Twitter, Opie Radio.  He's got it up.  You've got to check it out.  Later on today, Opie, I gave him the card.  I was filming it.  I got it from the other side.  Opie's going to put it up on Opie Radio on YouTube.  So make sure you check that out.  Today's show was brought to you by?  Today's show, of course, Eric, was brought to you by Trojan.  Today's show was five minutes long. 
[04:13:00]  It was brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms.  Trojan, America's number one most trusted condom brand.  And tomorrow, I know I had the big shout-out with Sterniolo on Friday.  He invited me to be a part of the phone show.  What?  He said, listen, I know you're upset about it.  I know you don't like us giving away all this money.  I know you can't figure out why anybody would ever listen to this show.  And all those things are true.  I know you'd want to keep plugging it, but we really have to go.  But tomorrow, I'll be on the phone show on Raw Dog, Sirius XM 99, at, I think, 1 p.m. 
[04:13:30]  So check it out.  And remember, we're going to have a new Patrice special.  Not the 16 hours you heard over the weekend.  Five more hours tomorrow morning, starting at 6 a.m. right here.
