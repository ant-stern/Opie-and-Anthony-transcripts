<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a rap intro featuring 50 Cent, Larry King, and Mike Tyson.  The hosts immediately addressed a major technical malfunction—a severely deteriorated ribbon cable—that had taken their show off the air for a day and a half.  They blamed outdated equipment and criticized Sirius XM management, specifically Scott Greenstein, for inaction despite prior complaints.  They highlighted their contractual obligations preventing them from leaving Sirius XM, despite their high ratings and lack of support.  Frustration with miscommunication regarding studio readiness was also expressed.  The conversation then shifted to the Sirius XM holiday party, which they missed due to the technical problems.  They described the party, noting the presence of various Sirius XM personalities, the music (a Christmas/hip-hop mix), and a ping-pong tournament with unconventional rules that sparked debate.  A substantial portion focused on Dennis Falcone's inappropriate, sexually suggestive behavior towards female employees at the party, with several instances detailed. Falcone himself later called in to offer a less than convincing defense.  The show's engineer, Mars, was also prominently featured, frequently sleeping due to exhaustion from repairing the studio.

The show continued with a detailed recounting of another office holiday party, this time centering on a co-worker named Denny and his allegedly outrageous behavior. Accounts varied widely, with Denny claiming he was merely "a little buzzed" and engaging in "goofy" antics, referencing Don Rickles and *Napoleon Dynamite*.  However, numerous coworkers, including Lauren (who called into the show), described sexually suggestive comments made to female colleagues, including an alleged request for a "copy of her ass" and solicitations for kisses.  Rich Davis and Tommy (a producer from Hits 1) are also mentioned as witnesses.  The hosts and callers debated the extent of Denny's actions and intentions, with accusations of sexual harassment and counter-accusations of exaggeration and conspiracy.  The discussion involved many crude jokes and references to sex, alcohol, and bodily functions.  The segment included unrelated tangents, such as a promotion for a Paranormal Activity movie and a discussion about a wine gift.

The broadcast then featured reminiscing about old radio show tapes, including a bit with a large Howard Stern-style wig. A comedic psychiatric hotline skit by caller "Rocco" (who the hosts mentioned had passed away) followed, where he hilariously guessed a caller's girlfriend's name.  The hosts discussed negative experiences with other station personalities and reflected on old studio footage and equipment.  The conversation moved to a story about comedian Pete Davidson driving a seemingly geographically challenged Mike Buschetti home. Buschetti then joined the show, discussing his agoraphobia, living in his mother's attic in a Russian-speaking neighborhood, his fear of Russians, and humorous Staten Island navigation anecdotes.  Further topics included Christmas shopping, awkward rose-seller encounters, and wearing mismatched shoes.  An unexpected interruption occurred with Guy Fieri and "The Mad Cuban" appearing in the studio.  The interview with Buschetti resumed, covering more life experiences and dating mishaps.

A caller, "Lady Di," joined, revealing a surprising lack of knowledge about Nelson Mandela despite claiming to admire him.  The conversation included her Christmas plans, job search (Burger King and Family Dollar applications), and candid responses about her personal life and dating. Colin Quinn joined the call, engaging in a humorous exchange about New Year's Eve plans and job prospects. Lady Di concluded by mentioning giving $25 in Christmas cards.  Further discussion with Lady Di involved questioning her knowledge of Nelson Mandela, speculation about her drinking habits, and comedic exchanges stemming from the hosts' difficulty spelling Mike Buschetti's last name. Colin Quinn's absence was noted.  "The Mad Cuban," revealed as a Guy Fieri employee, was playfully teased about Fieri's absence. Dan Soder was also in the studio, receiving an extra Queen of the Stone Age concert ticket from Opie. The show concluded with discussions about Robinson Cano's alleged child support issues, a Fox News report on Santa Claus's image, a street observation, and the hosts' dislike of Pete Carroll and the Seattle Seahawks.  Dr. Steve called in with a high fever, his call interspersed with the hosts' off-color commentary.

A segment focused on an article arguing against the exclusive portrayal of Santa Claus as a white man.  The hosts and callers debated this, referencing St. Nicholas, and drawing comparisons to welfare and societal associations of gift-giving.  The conversation expanded to include Jesus's race and historical accuracy, Megyn Kelly's commentary on Santa, the Black Pete controversy, and the historical evidence for Jesus.  A humorous anecdote involved a chance encounter with Guy Fieri at SiriusXM studios due to construction. The hosts' reactions to Fieri's hat and his "Cuban" friend were highlighted.  Phone calls from various listeners contributed to the chaotic and often profane discussions.  Later, the conversation turned to a pregnant Nicole from the "Morning Mashup," her sex life (or lack thereof), and her husband's reactions. This led to vulgar jokes about sex, pregnancy, and sexual acts.  A Festivus pole near a nativity scene prompted further irreverent commentary.  A young Elvis impersonator from Montreal briefly performed, followed by the engineer's snoring.  Dan Soder was a guest throughout a significant portion.

The final segment included a commercial for Steven Singer Jewelers (with the website "IHateStevenSinger.com"), playful banter with sexually suggestive comments towards a female staff member, Nicole, and Dan Soder promoting his New Year's Eve shows.  The biggest announcement was Garth Brooks' upcoming appearance on Sam Roberts' show, eliciting enthusiastic and profane reactions from the hosts.  The segment ended with a commercial for Afro and Friends, a source for Opie and Anthony audio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio!  Ooh!  Yeah, check, yo, yo, check it.  I'm up early in the morning, yawning with Opie Anthony, yeah, Jimmy Tranny pointing.  Opie like brother man, aunt wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand, he working all the hands.  Turn my headphones up!  There are horrible people to say in the zone.  Objectible human beings, and I want you to look unacceptable to my scene. 
[00:00:30]  Well, I'll give it a go.  If he said Larry King, Opie and Anthony show.  Go, go, I know you're feeling the flow.  But Opie's motherfucking things trying to get blown.  They would come to play around and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before.  How important is the board?  Bored you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah, on the edge of your hair.  Cause you really want to hear Opie Anthony and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie Anthony show. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  The Opie Anthony show.  Yeah.  Check it out.  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Yo.  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  50.  Yeah.  Now my guy's up in this bitch.  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Booga booga.  Booga booga.  Enough of this platter.  Let's get this show on the road.  Ah, good morning everyone.  Alright.  Okay.  That's not alright.  That's not bad.  That's not bad.  I cannot believe that those guys did that for us. 
[00:01:30]  That is a good intro.  We've heard it a lot now, but every Friday we play that and I'm just blown away that we  have 50 Cent, Larry King and Mike Tyson rapping about the radio show.  Yeah.  Huge.  The mic sounds a little weird, but considering what happened the last two days, we'll be  all right.  It's different, but okay.  Right.  And then you get used to it after a little while anyway, and then it becomes the new 
[00:02:00]  normal.  Yeah, we were knocked off the air for a day and a half or so.  Yes.  Without a long bitch session, I just want to like quickly say, Mars is what?  Incompetent and obviously it's all his fault.  Oh, Mars.  I see there's a new little computer down by my feet.  What is that?  Does that run the whole show?  Right.  If I kick it, what happens?  What is that?  Yes.  If you kick that, we're done.  That's it. 
[00:02:30]  What is it?  That is it.  It's a new little computer down there, a little tower.  Well, you know how you say that I'm boring on the air, especially when I talk this technical  jargon.  So that CPU was in the frame that runs clots.  Ah, right.  So we just, the CPU fried.  See, that's the problem.  Get the CPU.  The problem is we have clots.  Yeah.  You want to keep that shit flowing.  Uh-huh.  What?  Clots.  All I want to say is really, really quickly, because I know the true fans, you know, they 
[00:03:00]  fucking get sick of the bitching.  But we told the company that we're in an old studio with really old equipment, and now  it's breaking down.  And then I got in trouble because I'm tweeting about it.  They got mad at my tweets.  I'm like, fuck you, man.  Fix our shit.  The machine breaks down.  We break down.  Right.  And then you won't get shitty tweets about the company.  You know?  They had a little hissy fit about that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But sue the company, and they'll be cool with you and throw you a fucking party. 
[00:03:30]  A big birthday party, apparently.  But it's, you know, we have very old equipment in here.  Where are you going, Mars?  I'm going to show you.  Hold on.  It's not good.  Mars is supposed to be in here.  It's show and tell.  Well, Mars is very excited we're back on the air because he's going to cover his ass now.  Because a lot of people are pointing fingers at Mars.  Oh, yeah.  And that's why I wanted to talk about this just for a few minutes, I swear, and then we'll  move on.  This has nothing to do with Mars.  No.  We've been bitching to Scott Greenstein about how this is a really shitty studio. 
[00:04:00]  This was supposed to be temporary when we moved over from XM because we had that  state-of-the-art studio.  They spent about a million dollars on that studio, Ant.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  Back in the day.  And then they moved this over here and said, no, it's going to be great.  It's only temporary.  We're going to put you in this one studio and we'll redo it.  What is that?  What happened to that?  Guys, I'm showing Opie and Anthony a ribbon cable that connects the motherboard  to a hard drive.  Right.  And if you can see, it's actually almost disintegrating.  The insulation is just crumbling off of it and it was twisted around a little so it 
[00:04:30]  just shorted out.  Right.  Exactly.  So, it's falling apart.  How old is that thing?  I think about six years old, that's when we got that frame.  Is that long for a piece like that?  Oh, yeah.  Especially when the lid sits right on top of it and there's no vent.  It's just heating up and burning the insulation off of everything.  Wow, that's fucking...  But what made it at that one second just decide, oh, the wires are going to touch together  right then and there.  But look at that.  He just rubbed it with his hands a little bit and it's like it has dandruff. 
[00:05:00]  It's like jizz on your stomach when you wake up the next morning.  It's completely falling apart.  It's completely falling apart.  Yeah, potato flakes.  You know, but they, I don't know, it's, you know, they don't want to do the right thing  and then you bitch about them not doing the right thing and then you get in trouble for,  you know, tweeting.  Oh, boy.  It's amazing to me.  You know, all the equipment in here is very, very old.  We don't even want to be in this tiny little studio.  No.  But if we're going to be in this studio, then you've got to give us the real shit. 
[00:05:30]  Period.  At least a working studio.  Right.  That'd be nice.  One that doesn't crash.  And then there's complete incompetence because we were all told the studio was ready to go yesterday.  And then, then, you know, I live close.  So I was already here.  You're on the way, on the way in.  And then Mars is like, they should have told you this thing was working.  It's not even close to working.  I was, I was pretty close when I got the Sam Roberts phone call. 
[00:06:00]  Who told you that it was working yesterday?  I got an email.  I got an email from Dandy Don Wicklin.  Right.  That said, it said, might not be a show tomorrow.  Right.  Because studio is still down.  Stay tuned.  You know, stay close.  And then it was, oh, studio is up and running.  Show tomorrow.  Right.  And that was from an email from Wicklin.  So I'm like, oh, okay.  Well, we're coming in.  We're doing a show.  Right.  And then, and then it was like, no, no one should have said that. 
[00:06:30]  That.  So who told Don that the studio was fixed?  Uh, you're going to have to ask Don that question.  I love it.  This place is the best.  Wow.  Isn't that amazing?  I love it.  I'm not blaming Don Wicklin.  I'm not blaming anybody.  He might've got some info from somebody else.  And that's why he sent out the email.  Well, that's just it.  Period.  I know Don Wicklin wouldn't have just on his own said, I think the studio is fixed. 
[00:07:00]  Of course not.  They told him.  Of course.  That it should be up and running.  I bet they said it should be up and running by tomorrow.  Right.  A couple, a couple of really fast things.  Uh, people are like, well, why don't you guys just leave?  We can't leave.  We're under contract.  If we leave, they'll, they'll hold us to that.  We're under our voices anytime soon.  Okay.  Get sued too.  Uh, the other thing is, uh, and, and I know this was a hater, but he did make a good point.  So fuck it.  Wow.  So you guys just keep on bitching and bitching, but you don't do anything about it. 
[00:07:30]  And he's right.  He's right.  If we don't do anything about it come October, then, then it's, it's our, our fucking fault.  Yeah.  All right.  Period.  You're right.  We don't do anything about it for whatever reason.  Cause then every contract comes around and they, they give us a little bit, a little  bit just to kind of, you know, keep us coming back for more, but you know, it's time to get  a lot.  And if we don't do that, then it's our own fucking fault.  Period.  You know, the, the writing's on the wall.  It's really obvious. 
[00:08:00]  We want to do way more with this radio show than they, they don't.  It's not that they don't care about us.  Cause I've been thinking about this a lot in the last two days.  I've seen the numbers.  They say we're like pretty much the second, uh, most popular show here at serious XM behind  Howard.  So they care, but they don't care as much as we do.  We, we, we want to be doing a lot more with this radio show and they, they just think,  ah, we got them.  They got a little studio and, and, uh, the numbers are great for those guys.  So that's, that's all that should matter. 
[00:08:30]  So we don't have to give them anything else.  No.  Are they getting the job done with what we give them?  So I don't believe they don't care at all, but they don't care as much as we do.  You know, we want to be doing animation festivals.  We want to be doing that boat cruise.  We want to maybe, you know, dip our feet back into the, uh, the comedy show arena again.  Hells.  Yeah.  But we need support from the company we work for and, and they just don't see it.  Yeah.  But they, you know, day to day shit.  They're, they're happy.  They're happy because, because the subscribers are up because of us. 
[00:09:00]  I mean, our, our portion of it, obviously I'm not, I'm not going to be like an idiot down  the hall and, and claim that, uh, all the success of Sirius XM is because of us.  Of course not.  But in our little world and what they need from us, we're doing very, very well.  Mm-hmm.  Extremely well.  Absolutely.  No, it's, no, it's fucked up.  Like we have these Denon, um, CD players in front of me.  I thought these things were maybe, maybe 10 years old. 
[00:09:30]  See, Mars is laughing.  You know when I discovered that these things are really old?  Recently I got that, um, video from Brother Weez of Sam Kinison in his studio from 1989.  I posted some of it, some of it on my YouTube channel.  Yeah.  But in that video are Denon's.  Same one.  Denon's.  These things are almost 25 years old, right?  They're very old, yes.  These are 25 years old.  Wow.  Sturdy.  25 years old.  Don't worry, we got a whole bunch in the back to replace those. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, really?  So, you know.  New technology.  And the one thing, because I know Scott Greenstein, I'll say his name, he's very mad at my tweets.  You know, but the guy has just lied to me over and over again, so I don't know what he expects.  You know, this studio was supposed to be temporary.  It's not.  It's not.  It's our, it's not, we're not moving to a bigger space.  We, we, he told me to my face we were gonna, you know, take this wall down and they were gonna give us a little taste of what was behind this. 
[00:10:30]  That did not happen.  He told us he wants a big event from us, so we hand him a big event, and that's not happening.  So what does he expect?  He gets no respect from me.  He gets no respect from me.  He gets no respect from me.  I'll, I'll speak for myself, because I know people around here are getting nervous when I start talking about this.  No, I'm sure.  But he gets no respect from me, because he, nothing comes, nothing happens.  He just lies to your face to make you go away, so he can move on to the next meeting. 
[00:11:00]  And I, I personally have no problem leaving this company.  Right now.  No problem.  But make sure, you know, I gotta make sure I can work tomorrow though.  Because I ain't gonna sit around and do nothing until they, uh, officially release us.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So with that, we're back in our shitty studio that they kind of duct tape back together again.  Yeah, we got it, uh, kinda.  But then Tim Sabian.  Shuffed together with bubble gum.  Tim Sabian, I, you know, I had a bunch of conversations with him the last, uh, day and a half. 
[00:11:30]  And I feel bad for Tim, because I go, Tim, man, I, I wanted to work with you years ago.  And I, I go, I think you might have came late to the party.  You know, we're kinda wrapping up now, you know.  Uh-huh.  You can see what's left in the keg.  You might be able to get a cup of beer or two in that red cup.  The keg's starting to float.  Yeah, it's floating in the water, so.  Go see what you can get out of the keg.  But this party is almost over.  Because, oh man, just give me a chance.  Because I do believe in Tim Sabian.  Because he's the first guy since Eric Logan that understands actually how to do radio, which 
[00:12:00]  this whole thing is.  It's radio.  Yeah.  You know, they like to think of it as an entertainment company and all that.  But I haven't seen one person in these hallways that actually looks at this as radio.  Eric Logan did.  Yeah.  But the rest of them don't, including Scott Greenstein.  He doesn't understand how radio works.  He understands how to hobnob with celebrities and then get a good press release going.  And if that works for the company, so be it.  But we needed a guy that knows radio.  We finally got him.  But I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:12:30]  I don't know.  You've got to vigorously pump the old keg before every pour now.  Right.  Right.  You mostly foam.  And then I told Anthony when I got in this morning, like, they're looking at this as  a victory.  Uh-huh.  That they got the studio back up and running.  And we want better victories then.  Good news, guys.  Your studio is back working.  That's a victory?  That should just be...  The studio should just work.  Right.  That shouldn't be a victory. 
[00:13:00]  And the fact is, no matter, you know, what you do for a living, shit happens, obviously.  But we've been telling them for...  Yeah.  I was trying to figure...  At least three years that this is an old fucking studio.  Yeah.  With old equipment and old computers and, I mean, we could go around the room.  Big giant monitors and Denon players that are from the at least late 80s.  There are some chords in the back here of the Denons that, like, I...  Doesn't it look like the little thing I used to have to hook my joystick up to with the 
[00:13:30]  computer?  Right.  On my computer with the two screws and...  Like, this shouldn't be like that.  It should be new.  Shiny.  But like that hater said, you know, he's right.  I mean, if we don't do anything about it in October, then it's our own fucking fault.  Hey!  We either get this, you know, figured out, you know, properly...  Proper.  Or we fucking have to just fucking move on.  Yeah.  Period.  So...  Yeah.  With that said, Mars, how'd you fuck up this one? 
[00:14:00]  I don't know.  It'll come out in...  It'll come out soon.  I don't know.  I love that you're saving that piece for when they try to, like, blame you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's the only reason he still has that.  Because most people, when they're, like, fixing shit, they just throw everything away,  you know?  No, he needs the evidence.  Uh-uh.  He fucking kept it for evidence.  Yep.  But are they gonna say you should've known that piece was going and you should've replaced  it?  No, the big talk is... 
[00:14:30]  Scuttlebutt.  What's the big scuttlebutt?  Yeah, what's the scuttlebutt around the place?  Some people thought that the room was ready yesterday, when I never said it was.  Alright, that's the big...  That's gonna be the big issue.  That's the big issue.  Everything else doesn't matter.  The fact that the studio went down in the first place, that's all nothing.  Now they'll just concentrate on, who said it was ready yesterday?  Completely losing focus on what's the important part of this whole thing.  It's an issue of miscommunication.  Right.  They love that.  Not technology. 
[00:15:00]  They love that.  There's gonna be memos and meetings and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And now the fact that the studio went down in the first place?  Right.  That don't even really matter anymore.  It's peripheral.  But that's corporate bullshit.  To the corporate bullshit.  See, because, you know, all of a sudden I'm at fault because I tweeted my frustrations.  It's like, no, let's keep to what's going on here.  Look out.  The studio is a piece of shit and we've been telling you for years, but now that doesn't  matter because I had horrible tweets about it.  And trust me, I held back.  I held back.  But now it's not, now it's about, you know, it's not about faulty equipment. 
[00:15:30]  It's that people are starting to think that you were the one that said the studio was ready.  Someone said something.  We gotta find out.  Technically, not, I mean, technically, Mars is in charge of this little spot.  Right.  We gotta find out who said that.  Big investigation, I bet.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I know exactly what happened.  Corporate bullshit.  It's like in a tech.  Well, you had to get other.  And it showed.  You had to get other people involved who want to spend the bare minimum here. 
[00:16:00]  And they checked a few things and went, oh, if this is, see, how smart am I, Mars?  And I'm not even in your world, but I know this.  So they don't want to spend a lot of time on us, obviously, because we're not a priority  by any means.  So this person came in, heard a few things were working and just assumed, okay, the studio's  back and running.  Am I right?  Mm-hmm.  Did we talk before the show?  Of course not.  No, we did not.  But that's pretty much what happened.  I saw your, Sam. 
[00:16:30]  Mars is having a real tough time biting his tongue this morning.  But you saw him fist pump like I was right, right?  I saw some severe body language, like Opie was racing down the right track.  Uh-huh.  It's like, okay, that nonsense is done.  We can move on to, you know, polishing Howard's fucking chair for the next time you broadcast.  Make sure it's all polished, all nice and shiny.  That's the important part.  Right.  All right.  You know.  Well, we're here.  A lot of people are trying to blame the serial incident on the, uh. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  I heard, I did hear, during yesterday's Ron and Fez show.  Right.  A single Lucky Charms marshmallow was found under the board.  Oh, really?  That might have been it.  That might have been it.  And Fez told me that he didn't know if pulling that out would be, oh, we found the cause of the problem, or pulling it out would be the one piece that was holding everything together.  Yeah, fixing everything.  Woo!  Oh, boy. 
[00:17:30]  Why?  Oh, no.  I like the new Fez.  He's back.  Fez is back.  So, Marge, you had to sit through Ron and Fez yesterday to make sure that, so what, you got the studio up and running in time for those guys?  Yes.  And I had to sit around and make sure that everything was properly functioning during the show.  Uh-huh.  They forced you to sit here the entire show?  They didn't force me.  You know, I just do an operational check and stuff, and I was very stressed out yesterday. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, were you?  Uh-huh.  And I'm the type of person that when I stress out, I get very tired, very sleepy.  Are you like one of those fucking, like one of those sheep that just tip over when they're stressed out?  The fainting fucking sheep.  So you had to just sit here for four hours?  Yes.  No, not four.  I had to sit here for four hours.  I sat here for an hour.  Handcuffed to the computer.  Well, you sat here for an hour.  How long did you sleep?  Oh, boy.  Not quite sure.  I'm not sure about that.  Go, Mike.  Go, Mike. 
[00:18:30]  As we speak, this man has been working so long that you'll be able to hear this now.  This is Mars sleeping in the corner.  He's been working on this since yesterday morning.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  This is our engineer, Mars. 
[00:19:00]  Jesus.  You might want to get a...  Oh, man.  You're sick.  You're a real...  Oh, boy.  You're sick.  You're a real...  Oh, boy.  You're a real...  Oh, boy.  This is our engineer, Mars.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You're a real...  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit, you're a real...  Mars, snoring like that is what killed Reggie White. 
[00:19:30]  You've got to be very, very careful.  Oh, my God.  It sounded like Terry Shivo at first.  Wow, that was loud.  That was loud, Mars.  Damn.  That was the first time Mars heard that back, by the way.  Oh, yeah, no idea.  They fucked you?  No, I had an idea when I woke up.  Ron Fett's fucked you.  You understand that, right?  Not necessarily.  Yeah, they fucked you.  They should have let you sleep in peace.  They're evil human beings.  They couldn't do a radio show.  It was too loud over on the couch.  Yeah.  Right.  Nothing says you sucked then looking in the corner and seeing someone fucking snoring, by the way. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, yeah, that'll take you out of your show pretty quickly.  Wow, man, you've got a sleeping problem.  Yes, I do.  You've got to take care of that.  Yeah, my wife gets startled all the time, wakes me up.  She thinks I'm dead.  Wow.  And what are you, like, narcoleptic?  Do you just go to sleep really quickly?  I can't?  Yeah.  Yep.  I would assume every human being has a sleeping problem. 
[00:20:30]  Some kind of disorder.  I've never met a person that goes, oh, God, I sleep like an angel every night.  Yeah.  Every single person you talk to has some kind of issue with their sleep habits.  All right.  So, good job falling asleep on Ron yesterday.  Thank you, O.P.  I try.  Right.  Fez didn't mind that the attention was taken away from for a few minutes while they focused  on you snoring or what?  What happened?  First of all, the show's called Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez. 
[00:21:00]  You can't say falling asleep on Ron.  This one.  Falling asleep on Ron.  It's not called Ron.  What?  The show's not called Ron.  Oh.  It's Ron and Fez.  Right.  Love Fez.  He's back.  He walked by our meeting the other day and I was waving like a lunatic to show that I  support him.  You saw it.  I saw the waving.  I haven't heard a lot to back that up, but I saw the waving.  Mm-hmm.  Oh. 
[00:21:30]  Eric.  It's the E-Rock.  Hey.  You got something to add?  No.  Oh.  Take a photo of this.  Oh.  Mars is staying standing up because he knows if he sits down, it's Dunsky.  He's going to pass out.  Back to snooze.  Yeah.  I'm good to go, Tay.  I want to take a photo of that, too.  Absolutely.  Before they shut down my Twitter officially.  Can you make it all flaky on the board again?  Yes, absolutely.  Because that's really impressive.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, boy.  So.  That insulation just crumbles right off of that thing. 
[00:22:00]  What flashes through your head when, like, you wake up from an obvious deep sleep  and you realize you're live on the Ron and Fez show?  Is it, like, fear?  No.  I thought it was really funny.  Uh, fear of what?  No, I mean, just because you're so surprised.  Like, when you wake up sometimes, you're like, what the fuck is going on?  No, they got me.  I'm like, these bastards got me.  You knew immediately.  Oh, damn.  That's funny.  All right.  Just send that one to me.  Your picture will be better.  All right.  We got to move on to other business.  Oh, yeah.  The big, uh, winter festival party was yesterday.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:30]  Is it the winter festival party, or?  I believe it was the winter holiday gathering.  The winter holiday gathering.  I got to tell you, if we had done a show.  You were going to go?  I was going to stay in the city.  You were really going to go?  Yeah, because it sounded like something that would have been good for the show today.  A lot of booze, a lot of cupcakes.  Yeah.  Please, no, no, please, Ant, don't say that, because then that's my fault, because you  weren't there.  Oh, shit.  Nah, not Mars' fault.  Mars had been on his game, man.  It would have been at the party.  It's that fucking wire. 
[00:23:00]  It's like Apollo 13.  It just happened.  We don't know.  Something that was there.  I blame Tom Hanks.  Opie stirred the tanks, and, uh, you know, spark, and boom.  We blew out half the fucking command module.  There you go.  So, how was the, uh, what is it called?  Winter holiday?  I think it was a winter holiday gathering.  Winter holiday gathering.  It's the don't mention Christmas under any circumstance party.  Right.  Where everybody was welcome.  That's one thing people have to remember.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:23:30]  It's what makes us different.  But why is it, if, uh, another, like, religious holiday is mentioned, that we don't care?  It's fine, like Ramadan.  I don't care.  Or Kwanzaa.  And if they wanted to throw a Ramadan or Kwanzaa party around here, I wouldn't care.  Who cares?  You wouldn't complain that you're being left out?  Fuck no.  I'm being left out.  No.  Why would anyone do that?  And why would you listen to those people?  Christmas is the big man on campus.  That's why.  That's the one to go after.  It's the number one.  That's your big one. 
[00:24:00]  You knock it down, and then you can be the number one, I guess.  Right.  So, uh, everyone's got a bitch.  If they're not part of Christmas, why do they get Christmas?  And we get, uh, right.  We'll call it a fucking holiday extravaganza.  It was the year-end holiday gathering.  The year-end holiday gathering.  I don't like the word gathering for anything.  It's a party.  It sounds like, uh, you're in druid hoods.  Right.  And, and you're, you're chanting or something when there's a gathering.  It's, it's a Christmas party.  It's an office Christmas party. 
[00:24:30]  Yes, it's an office Christmas party.  Period.  Can we fucking be a little bit of Americana here?  Especially if you do it around when Christmas is being celebrated.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Anything that's a year-end party, but it's before the 25th, is actually a Christmas party.  But if people really want to get away from this whole Christmas thing and not mentioning Christmas,  then wouldn't you just blow off the Christmas time?  Because you're like, we don't believe in that as a company.  And we'll throw our winter gathering in January.  Yeah.  When it's very obvious there's no religious holidays around it. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  You're just dressing it up differently.  It's still, it's still a office Christmas party, but you can't say that for whatever reason.  Winter literally just started.  What are we celebrating?  I don't think winter.  Not even started yet.  Yeah.  What's wrong?  You don't know your shit.  It was snowing.  Yeah.  We got eight more days before Christmas starts.  Winter.  I mean, uh, winter starts.  Really?  The winter.  Yep.  So we had the winter gathering way too early.  Yeah.  It's still fall.  So technically it should have been a late fall gathering.  What is it?  It sounds like some pagan fucking seasonal thing. 
[00:25:30]  The winter gathering.  But you could still, you're still celebrating Christmas.  Of course.  But you just got to call it something else.  Because if you call it Christmas, people are offended.  That ain't no winter gathering tree.  People that will be offended still go to the party going, oh, it's okay because they didn't  call it Christmas.  No one really cares except like HR going through their rules to protect themselves.  Right.  Let's call it something else.  Right.  There's red and green cupcakes with holly on them. 
[00:26:00]  What could possibly be more Christmasy than that?  Not the girl.  What are the highlights of the gathering?  Well, what did we miss?  It was fun.  Was it fun?  They had the bottles out.  Popping bottles.  Yeah.  People were popping bottles.  They had garbage bins full of beer.  Was Who Kid here?  Who Kid was not there.  Oh, damn it.  All right.  Then it's not a real party.  Sway was there.  Sway was there.  Okay.  All right.  He's an older OG, though.  He is.  He's an OG.  He's an actual OG.  Right.  But man, if they could have got Who Kid on board, then this place would have been packed. 
[00:26:30]  Because then people would have been like, okay, it's happening.  What kind of music?  Christmas music.  Oh.  Well, that's weird because it's not a Christmas party.  Why were they playing Christmas music?  Do you understand the insanity of this?  It's so stupid.  As long as you don't call it the Christmas party, it's okay.  But you're doing everything Christmassy right now.  They were playing Holly, Christmas Hits, the radio channel.  Yeah.  Although there was hip-hop being played in the fishbowl because that was the ping-pong room. 
[00:27:00]  Uh-oh.  And they had a little DJ.  That sounds like it's, hey, it looks stinky.  Stinky.  It's always fun to see Stinky walk by in the hallways.  He was at the party for a little bit.  Stinky was there?  For a little bit, but he had J. Thomas duties at the same time.  Oh, boy.  Ew.  That's disgusting.  Exactly.  He was eating them.  Making cookies out of it.  Making holiday cookies out of it.  That's all he does on that show.  I guarantee it would be nutty.  Eat his nutty-duty.  Nutty-duty. 
[00:27:30]  But yeah, we all watched the big ping-pong game.  Ah, that was the highlight.  Yep.  I guess.  Everyone had a root against the boss.  Oh, boo!  Boss!  However, I'll tell you this.  What?  Sway was not victorious.  Of course not.  Did he throw it?  Well, I talked to Sway after.  Uh-huh.  And he said, because I didn't, I don't know how that game is played.  Like, how the fuck do you score ping-pong?  Yeah, it's like tennis.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, how the fuck do you score tennis? 
[00:28:00]  Well, you get the point.  You've never played ping-pong?  No, I have played it, but I don't know how to score it.  I don't know.  If you're the one that serves...  You can only score when you're serving.  ...and they miss...  Yeah.  ...you get a point.  Right.  I don't get it.  If you're not serving, and they miss, then you get the serve.  Right.  And now you've got an opportunity to get points.  I never bothered to learn the rules, because I can't hit that little white ball anyway.  That's fucking...  You are so not a man.  Well, because I can't play ping-pong?  Yeah.  No, that's not how we play.  What happened?  Oh, boy.  No, that's not how you play.  This is the way we play here.  This is the ghetto version that they set up on, like... 
[00:28:30]  It's the way we play.  You know what you mean?  And by we, he means...  Yeah.  Urbanites.  No, I do not.  I play with white people all the time, and only white people.  Oh, shit, yo.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, he gave up on his people.  Yeah.  Anyway...  This is like when they play chess in the park by different rules.  Uh-huh.  Different rules.  Anyway, will you tell me if this is wrong?  Okay, I serve first, and I have two serves.  All right?  I serve.  If I score, I get the score.  And if you score, you get the score.  Oh, yeah?  If you score, you get the score.  Right?  I don't think...  And then...  Wow, you don't know studios, and you don't know ping-pong. 
[00:29:00]  That ain't how you play ping-pong.  And then after my two serves, then I change over...  After your two serves?  Then it changes over to your two serves, and then it changes back to my two serves.  After your two serves, you get your two serves, and then your two serves to your two serves.  So what...  That sounds like everyone has the opportunity to score, then.  Right.  Exactly.  Uh...  Uh-oh.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  I don't know.  If you play by...  It's like we're all not a man here.  But if you play by tennis rules, then that ain't it.  Right.  But it's not totally...  Wait, he might be right. 
[00:29:30]  I am right.  Which makes us look like assholes.  Someone's saying that's wrong, Mars.  You don't keep alternating the...  You get two serves each?  Yeah.  But do you get two serves each, but then the point thing is still...  You can only score if you're serving?  No.  Holy fuck, I forgot how to play ping pong.  You serve...  Yeah, you serve to your miss.  Stop.  You sure?  Right?  Yeah.  I gotta be.  I was...  I'm trying to think of when I was watching Forrest Gump, and he was doing really well  at the ping pong.  Yeah, let's go to the Forrest Gump tape.  Forrest Gump.  Oh, there's a lot of fucking rules. 
[00:30:00]  There's gotta be something simpler than that.  Oh, come on.  Just do the serving part.  Everyone's calling.  Was there a holiday tree at the party?  Kevin in South Carolina wants to know.  It was...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was a Christmas tree, yes.  It's Christmas decorations.  That's pretty symbolic.  It was all about Christmas.  It was all red, gold, and green.  Right.  All right.  See?  Look here.  Now, what are they saying about the serve?  Someone says there's a new rule change.  Ping pong has new rules?  I don't know.  What?  I don't know. 
[00:30:30]  Go ahead.  Let's see.  This guy knows the rules of ping pong.  Looks like it's not as common sense as everybody thought, is it?  He knows them right up until the next call.  I know.  That's why I'm doing this.  Exactly.  Dave on Long Island.  Dave.  Hey, how you doing?  Great.  Hey, everybody.  I serve five times.  Whoever gets the point gets the point.  Yeah.  Then you serve five times.  Hey, whoever gets the point gets the point.  When you serve from the right side, you've got to serve into the left side.  Oh, I know all that.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to serve into the left box.  I do five.  You do five. 
[00:31:00]  I do five.  You do five.  That's the way it works.  It always has.  Always.  But you can only score if you're serving, right?  No.  You go up to...  What the fuck?  How do I not remember how to play ping pong?  Is this how they were playing yesterday?  You guys are talking about volleyball.  That's volleyball rules.  I don't know.  Are you playing volleyball in the lobby?  No, no.  That would be fun.  The only difference between me and the caller...  That would explain why your shirt was off.  The only difference between me and the caller is that he's doing five serves.  You do two.  And I'm doing two. 
[00:31:30]  That's all.  And your shirt's off.  That does sound like ghetto rules.  Now...  Yeah.  That does sound like ghetto rules.  All right.  Let me go to Dakota to make sure this is right.  Dakota in New York.  Was that guy Dave Wright?  Yeah.  You get five serves and...  Okay.  Wow.  All right.  Well, you know what I was thinking?  Thanks.  I was thinking of the rules I saw once.  Because I watched a game once in Hong Kong.  Oh, is that different?  And it was...  Well, King Kong was playing...  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  ...a game of ping pong.  Mm-hmm.  In Hong Kong with his ding-dongs.  Yeah.  That's the game I was thinking of.  And it is.  You serve until you miss and then King Kong would serve.  You ever play with your ding-dong, Mars?  No.  Okay.  You use a paddle.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  So, what happened at the winter gathering?  Well, I talked to Sway after the...  There was booze.  There was ping pong.  Yeah.  Sway threw the game because he was scared that, you know...  They played best of three.  Right.  Our esteemed leader won the first game. 
[00:32:30]  Sway won the second game.  Oh, shit.  They kept it dramatic.  And I talked to Sway and he said that our boss narrowly edged out that third game for a victory.  Oh, boy.  Did he feel all good about himself after winning the ping pong match?  I don't know.  You know what Sway should have done?  March a B or C level celebrity passed him so he would, like, oh, run out to try to offer him a show.  Distract him.  But then, uh, there were... 
[00:33:00]  Roland.  Ah, Roland was there?  Roland came.  Oh, shit.  Right there.  And that's a party.  The price of admission.  No, because Roland's changed.  What?  You cannot bring that dude to a party anymore.  Oh, because he just bashes everything that's there?  Everything.  He's a snob.  Ever since he started hanging out with the fucking Cronut chef.  That Cronut guy.  That Cronut guy's a bunch of trouble for this show.  He was just like, everybody's having a good time.  Everybody's getting a solid buzz on. 
[00:33:30]  Uh-huh.  And Roland is just yelling at the top of his lungs about the food being cold.  About pedestrian food and pedestrian...  This pedestrian food is cold.  Yeah.  Who wants a cold burger?  Maybe if he was a pedestrian for a couple hours during the day.  Less of an issue.  He was talking about how the tacos were ice cold.  Yeah, and then he said the tacos were cold.  Ice cold.  As cold as the beer, he said.  Yeah.  And the beer was cold.  Like, he's rude.  Well, he's a foodie.  But he's become way more snobby than he used to be. 
[00:34:00]  Bottle beer or kegs?  Bottles.  In a big...  What kind of beer?  Big garbage bins.  They had like Brooklyn lager and...  Fancy beers?  Not super fancy.  Any just Bud Lights?  Things like that?  Sam Adams.  Yeah, Sam Adams.  All right.  They went all out.  All right.  Oh, here he is.  Roland, you didn't like the winter gathering?  What happened, Roland?  It was fine.  Just the food.  It was like 7-Eleven food.  And I'll say here, next year, I'm going to throw one invite-only in my office with the 
[00:34:30]  top chefs to show people this is food.  Wow.  Bunch of morons.  Why wouldn't they call you and ask you about how to cater this?  You would have got a bunch of chefs that would have done it for free.  Yeah.  They got falafel, ice cold.  Then they had a macaroni and cheese with the tongs.  Was it coagulated into a lump?  Beyond that, it all lifted together.  Oh, God.  Why wouldn't they...  Didn't they have the little fucking... 
[00:35:00]  You would think?  There was under there...  Sterno the Magnificent.  Ooh.  No sternos?  And then they had the burgers, and then they turned on so high, so where the mayonnaise  is, it's boiling, and then the hot is cold.  There was mayonnaise on them, and...  Yeah.  Ugh.  So people are waking up, shitting their brains out, going, what happened?  It's the burgers.  Nothing but a hot mayo.  They should have asked you.  Yeah, it was awful.  Then the tacos were awful.  Everyone knows that you know your food.  So they go, hey, everybody, how's everything?  I yelled, the food's cold!  Uh-oh.  But everybody's drinking. 
[00:35:30]  If they don't like the food, they'll have a few bites, they'll throw it out.  Everybody's having a good time.  It's not meant to be a sit-down dinner where the food's supposed to be good.  The food is just there to soak up some of the booze that you're putting down.  This will soak up shit.  It's awful.  Jesus.  It was a party in the lobby.  It's bad.  It's not like it was, like, you know...  Yeah, it was just a little...  A little bit.  A little bit together.  Or just come back on the wine, uh, whatever, find and throw it in.  Wine selection?  How was that?  That's what people wanted.  They had a ton of wine.  Did they?  Good wine. 
[00:36:00]  A nice Shiraz.  What kind of wine?  A nice Cabernet Sauvignon.  Like Dom DeLuise.  Dom DeLuise.  They had Dom DeLuise.  Wow.  Dom DeLuise.  They went all out.  Cheapo brand.  No, I didn't see anybody complaining.  Target.  A little glass with a Dom.  DeLuise, yes.  I didn't see anybody complaining about the booze.  No.  I mean, I wouldn't know.  Roland's all in, though, with his food and beverage.  He's just become such...  A snob.  An insufferable snob at this point.  Yes.  Wow.  It was Roland.  I mean, free food is good food.  If you're feeling bad food, shame on you. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  And everything has to come back to the food, too.  It's like you get into a conversation, you're joking, you're laughing, and then Roland goes,  yeah, but who wants a cold burger?  Oh.  Nobody's even talking about food.  We weren't talking about the food.  Oh, Roland.  Before we even got out there to see all the food, Roland was already telling everybody  that he researched the caterer.  Ow.  Why are you so loud?  Rock, what, did you punch yourself up there?  No.  You're a little extra loud.  Oh, sorry.  So I didn't really hear what you said.  His confidence was building over the last couple of days.  Oh, man. 
[00:37:00]  That's being pushed right down.  No.  Say it again.  I really didn't hear you.  Before we even got out there to try anything or see what was going on, Roland was already  telling everybody how he researched the caterer.  Oh, my God.  Really?  And he probably did.  Oh, yeah.  It was awful.  I was like, oh, God, this is going to be a shit fest.  But everybody was having a good time.  Yeah.  Except.  Except.  That's all that counts, right?  Oh, Roland.  Except Roland.  All they had to do was ask you, and you would have had some nice chefs down here that would  have done it on the arm. 
[00:37:30]  But his priorities are all fucked up.  Why?  There's no way that the office, the people who work here, there's no way they would have  wanted more money put into food than alcohol.  All they wanted to do was to drink it.  But I'm saying, I don't think it would have cost anything.  But he just said a minute ago they should have cut down on the wine budget and upped the  food budget.  Is there a lot of food left at the end of the party?  Yeah.  Even the homeless will walk by that shit.  That's usually a sign.  Even the homeless will walk by that shit, he says.  Wow.  Next year, I'm going to throw my own invite-only office party. 
[00:38:00]  And I go, oh, look.  Why wait until next year?  We have one more week left before we take a little break.  So why don't you have your own Christmas?  Set up your party next week.  I'm finding home.  When?  Tomorrow.  You're done?  Tomorrow?  Mm-hmm.  There's going to be, like, no staff here next week.  I'm here with you guys.  Why the fuck?  Why the fuck?  And that's, like, I think it's, like, me and Travis, Troy's going to be here for a little  while.  What happens?  Because they said we have to take vacation because we have 21 days.  And it's, like, we didn't take all our vacation. 
[00:38:30]  I was told.  That's why, you know.  Oh, well.  What happens?  We'll be here.  They approved us.  I was like, buh-buh.  So you're done for this year.  What do we got?  Tomorrow?  A full week, next week, and then that's it?  And then that's it.  We can do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll fuck around next week.  We'll pump it out, as they say.  Yeah.  Sure.  But you guys are invited to my soiree.  We'll be invited to the office in a year.  Thank you.  So why don't you have a true winter gathering, though?  Why don't you do it in January?  Yeah, do your own winter gathering.  Well, I texted CrowNet guy. 
[00:39:00]  He's and a couple other chefs are in.  That's the guy that fucked you up.  CrowNet guy.  Yeah.  CrowNet guy.  He jaded you.  He was already well on his way, but the CrowNet guy was the one that really.  And the CrowNet guy has a new cereal that he made.  It's delicious.  Yeah, and Roland's running around yesterday going, the CrowNet guy's new dessert is his cereal.  It's delicious.  I got cereal.  Gotta get my bowl.  Gotta get my cereal.  Right.  So he's got a, what is it?  This fucking, this gourmet shit cereal. 
[00:39:30]  What is it?  Dos de leche.  What is it?  Dos de leche.  Dos de leche.  It's like a caramel chocolate flavor.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's called dulce de leche.  Oh, dulce.  Or crucer.  Or crucer.  Or crucer.  Check it out.  Which, by the way, the fact that Mars had to redo that for Roland is even more insulting.  Uh-huh.  Because Roland's Mexican.  That's true.  It's Spanish.  Metzkin.  What's that?  Mech, meskixkin. 
[00:40:00]  Mets.  He says mets.  Metzkin.  Metzkin.  Right.  Metzkin.  Metzkin.  Metz-a-kin.  Yeah.  Oh, it's, well, look at that.  What, and what does that cost?  Fifty dollars for a bowl of fucking cereal?  Jesus Christ.  It's fifteen bucks for that little thing of cereal?  Fifteen bucks for a little bowl of cereal.  Is it healthy?  No, it's got real marshmallows in it.  Oh, I thought that was bananas.  I'm like, okay, I'll try it if that's bananas.  That is bananas.  Fifteen bucks for cereal?  What's the ingredients in this thing?  Uh, it's, uh. 
[00:40:30]  The chocolate caramel, like, thing.  There'd be gold doubloons in there for that fucking price.  You know how much sugar's in that shit, man?  Oh, I bet a lot.  It's caramelized milk chocolate with a dulce de leche flavor.  Mm.  Uh, and a plentiful amount of smoked cinnamon-flavored mini-me merengue kisses.  Oh, Jesus.  Meringue?  Yeah.  Meringue kisses.  Meringue kisses.  Spiced hazelnuts.  Spiced hazelnuts.  And a sugar brittle...  Wow.  Yeah, it couldn't be laughing. 
[00:41:00]  That's not breakfast.  No.  It's dessert.  That's like something you would eat at the movies.  That looks like an apple cobbler.  Yeah.  Ooh, that'd be nice if they had that there.  I do like apple cobbler.  Wow, Ron's very angry.  You're angry about the winter gathering.  Yeah, because I went home and blew my ass out from the food.  It hurt.  Well, I don't know what happened to Rowling, because he used to get drunk.  Like, he used to drink constantly.  Uh-huh, and not care about the food.  And now he's given up drinking and is just obsessed, addicted to food.  Well, I want to drink a lot if the food is delicious. 
[00:41:30]  I'm like, oh, great.  I'll drink a lot.  A couple drinks, celebrate the food.  Food?  I'll have both.  What else happened at the party?  Well, I mean, yeah, you talk about drinking.  Right.  Apparently, Dennis Falcone, he didn't overdo it with the drinks.  Oh, our own Denny Falcone was at the party.  But Dennis Falcone, he waited all day.  He's talking about the party.  He wore.  Is he here yet?  Mm-hmm.  He is.  Oh, I see that weird walk of his.  He wore.  He's walking down the hall.  They had Santa Claus do a town hall here for the Kids Channel. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Dennis Falcone got a laminate, because they give laminates to all the people who go to  them in the audience.  Uh-huh.  He got a laminate, and he wore the laminate all day yesterday.  He wore the laminate.  Just to celebrate Christmas.  Like, that was a week ago when Santa was here.  He was feeling special.  He was feeling special.  Right.  Like, look, they gave me a laminate for the Santa Claus interview.  For the Santa Claus interview.  Wow.  That's wonderful.  Is he almost here?  But he shows up to this thing.  Yeah.  And he had, like, three beers. 
[00:42:30]  Three beers?  Right.  Look out.  And all of a sudden, he's his whole other guy.  Uh-oh.  Really?  Like, I mean, he was inappropriate.  What?  Wow.  Dennis was inappropriate last night.  He was an inappropriate guy at the office party.  But you have no problem going on record in saying this.  I found him to be inappropriate.  Wow.  Why?  Whoa.  That's right.  I'm not issuing a complaint.  Here he comes.  But I thought his behavior was inappropriate.  And I worried that some of the female employees at this company, beautiful female employees 
[00:43:00]  at this company, may be offended by this.  Do you have any examples?  Yes, I do.  Let me hear it.  You want to hear it before he gets in?  Yes, yes.  He announced, he yelled out with everybody around him, who's got mistletoe on their belt  buckle?  Oh, no.  He actually said that.  Just a sea of employees, bosses, HR officials.  He was that guy.  Oh, you got it wrong.  Uh-oh.  Eric's very excited.  He yells out, am I the only guy with mistletoe on my belt buckle? 
[00:43:30]  That's even worse.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  What happened at office Christmas parties?  You want to hear another one?  People lose their minds.  He put a lampshade on his head and danced around?  What is this, from fucking Mad Men?  There's this girl, Lauren.  She's this young, 20-something blonde that works for the Cousin Brucie show.  Uh-huh.  And this is her first Christmas party here at this company.  It's like a dream come true, right?  Oh, must have been.  Must have been.  She loves this job still.  And that'll go away. 
[00:44:00]  Give it time.  She loves this job still.  Don't worry.  Give it time.  And is just having the time of her life.  Until Dennis Falcone asks her, hey, Lauren, how long till you hop up on that photocopier  and make a photocopy of your ass?  Oh, you can't say that?  Yes.  For real?  Yes.  That's true.  Then.  Oh, no.  There's some other chick who's walking by him.  I don't even know who this chick is.  I don't know her name, so I don't want to. 
[00:44:30]  Travis Teft?  It could have been Travis.  She wasn't here yesterday.  Oh, wow.  You should have the same figure, though.  Oh, a little waif-like.  And he goes, hey, honey, how about a kiss?  Hey, honey, how about...  Does he think it's 1950?  I don't know.  Three beers in.  Oh, God.  It's not like he wasn't stumbling around.  He's living mad men.  He is living mad men.  He was.  Nothing wrong with that.  He was Don Draper with a pedophile mustache.  Oh, my goodness.  It doesn't help. 
[00:45:00]  That mustache certainly doesn't help.  No.  The creep factor.  So, I mean, and he was like, immediately...  That's great.  ...like me and Iraq, who was also at the party, and Liam, the talent booker, we were all like,  Dennis, what the fuck are you doing?  Chill.  Like, what are you doing?  That's crazy inappropriate.  And Dennis went on his, you know, spectrum argument.  Oh, no, no.  Where, exactly.  Where, instead of...  Oh, I forgot.  He's very inappropriate.  Acknowledging.  He doesn't understand that he's being inappropriate.  Right.  Instead of acknowledging and correcting his behavior... 
[00:45:30]  He'll just deny.  He denied.  He justified.  We're at a party.  And alcohol is being supplied.  We're off work hours.  Wow.  He really justified it.  It was crazy.  Yeah, at one point, word was going around that the beer was starting to run out.  Uh-oh.  And he was already, like Sam said, three beers in, and he disappears.  He comes back later, and he's double fisting.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  He's got to take one for the road. 
[00:46:00]  Jesus.  Just in case everything ran out.  Yeah.  But, like, I mean, he wasn't the drunkest dude there.  It's not like the drinking was the part that was the problem so much as...  He's just got that in him.  Right.  Like, within the constraints of employment, he will adhere to all rules and regulations.  But if he can justify that it's a party, it's off hours, they supplied the booze, then the real Denny comes out, who is the guy that says, hey, toots, you know...  Jump up on that photocopy. 
[00:46:30]  Jump up on the photocopy machine.  Let me see that ass.  Well, people on the spectrum tend to not have a filter.  Yes.  Well, Opie, you may not know this, but it's a social disorder.  Or any self-accountability or anything.  Let's bring him in for a second.  Before you do this, one of my favorite parts, in our lobby, there's a staircase that goes from our floor to the 37th floor.  He's at the top of the floor.  He claps his hands and yells out to the party, hey, let's go to the strip club.  And he starts walking down the stairs with a strut. 
[00:47:00]  He was really making a scene.  He might as well have been walking around with mirrors on his shoes.  Right, right, shoe mirrors trying to look up girls' skirts.  I'm starting to understand why he doesn't have a full-time gig on air.  Wow.  I'm finally getting it.  You get three beers in him, just enough to loosen him up to be his true self.  Well, here he comes to defend himself.  Oh, yes.  Both lovely and talented.  Denny.  Hey, Denny, who's going to the strip club?  Do you marry me? 
[00:47:30]  No, it's the strip club.  What did you say?  Remember at the end of Caddyshack when Dangerfield says, hey, everyone, we're all going to get laid.  Hey, everybody, we're going for lap dances.  It was just something funny.  That's what I was doing last night.  But you don't work blue.  It's not blue.  That's not blue.  He doesn't work blue on the air, but he works blue around the office.  In life.  He always has fun.  Right.  At the office party, he certainly works blue.  And the office party was, like, mainly populated by the people who do not get to have fun at  this job.  Uh-huh.  Like, the people who work downstairs that we never see that sit in cubicles. 
[00:48:00]  They're not on-air people.  They're cubicle people.  They're, you know, bean counters and whatnot.  Right.  And the people, I mean, the...  Behind the scenes, folks.  Behind the scenes.  And narcs.  And narcs.  They'll say something.  Yeah.  Because they've been told they can't put pictures of their children in their cubicle.  Right.  Because it offends the women that can't have children.  But apparently this guy can get everybody laughing at us.  Uh-huh.  Denny, I'm hearing you were out of control.  No.  We just had a few beers.  You had mistletoe on your belt buckle.  No.  We had three beers. 
[00:48:30]  It's funny.  People posting pictures saying, Denny, six beers.  Next picture.  Denny, five beers.  I had three beers.  Yeah.  I told you, man, it wasn't...  Two Blue Moons and a Sam Adams.  What about asking the girl to get on the copy machine?  Oh, Lauren.  And I said, what are you doing?  She's standing by the copy machine eating cupcakes through.  Because she was, like, inhaling those things.  I said, hey, what are you...  Be careful to the copy machine.  What, are you going to jump up and take pictures?  No, you don't want to do that.  That's not the fuck what she said.  You don't want to do that.  See, that's just it, Denny.  That's not what you said, dude.  You can't say that.  No one blows my mind.  He said...  We have done, like, just vile, disgusting, shock jockery in our careers. 
[00:49:00]  And we know you just can't do stuff.  Oh, you like that.  But you know what?  I'm doing it.  I'm channeling, like, Dangerfield.  Just doing funny stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he uses character.  Yeah, I'm doing it in character.  Dennis uses character.  Now, like Mr. Adamus, he uses character.  Or keep talking while we're trying to do a little bit.  But that's okay.  You've got to use characters.  Let me just get my point across.  I grew that prior mustache.  Oh, yeah.  Just having fun.  I'm just doing lines from Rickles and goofy stuff. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, sure.  Give me a Rickles line.  I love Don Rickles.  I'm a big fan.  21-year-old fucking girl will understand that you're doing Rickles.  Yeah, of course.  But she, you know what?  Give me a Rickles.  I'm just saying, if it was something Rickles might sit, I don't know.  Well, you're lucky, yes.  No, no, no.  She wasn't laughing like, good one, Denny.  She was turning around to me and to E-Rock.  Making faces like, oh.  And going, like, laughing.  Can you believe what's happening?  He asked me to make a photocopy of my butt.  Wow. 
[00:50:00]  No, no.  I didn't say it in those words.  She said that you said butt.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  No, no.  She said that.  She doesn't lie.  Wow.  She doesn't lie.  Okay.  So, we're just having a good time.  She didn't have a good time.  We're just having a good time.  That's all it was.  That's just a good time.  Good time, indeed.  Yeah, that's all it is.  I never witnessed.  I mean, there are people from Hits 1 that were sitting there watching, like, what the fuck  is Denny doing?  Hey, who was there from Hits 1?  The new guy you guys don't know.  No, not the girls.  No?  None of the girls showed up.  None of the girls showed up.  No.  Rich Davis was there. 
[00:50:30]  Nicole ain't showing up if she can't drink with that kid in her gut.  Exactly.  She can't be around it.  I don't know.  They ran out of beer pretty fast.  Well, with guys like you, double fisting like that.  You know I was.  Jeez.  Let some people near the beer, Denny.  I'm here this early in the morning.  I'm not.  I'm sure they calculated the.  Functional alcoholic.  I'm sure they calculated the beer perfectly.  We're like, okay, if we have this much beer.  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They brought more in.  It's very likely that no one will be too buzzed.  Yeah.  But that to me is more disturbing. 
[00:51:00]  Because like I said, Dennis, he's right.  He was not drunk.  No.  He wasn't stumbling around.  He wasn't.  He was just a little buzzed and got some truth serum in him.  That's all it takes.  And all of a sudden he's asking girls who walk by him for a kiss.  No, I'm not.  You didn't say, hey, let's have a kiss.  No, of course not.  Four different people told me that separately.  Oh, shit.  No, of course not.  Then what happened?  I was standing by the tater tots.  And I said, you remember the movie Napoleon Dynamite when he stuffs the tater tots in his pocket? 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  And the guy's in the classroom saying, go, let me have some of your tots in the pool.  He goes, no.  And he smashes them.  So we were just laughing about the tater tots.  I think they were warm.  I'm talking about a different instance, obviously, but nothing about a kiss.  No, of course not.  You know what?  The tater tots goes back to Roland's point that the food might have not been up to par.  Look, people are just hanging out.  You can't have tater tots at a party.  It'll drive Roland nuts, though.  One young lady walked by and came over and gave me a kiss.  That's all.  Oh.  That's all.  On your belt buckle? 
[00:52:00]  No, on my cheek.  And then what did you say?  No, I said nothing.  Did your helmet start getting hard?  I think she likes me.  Did you then solicit any other girls for a kiss?  Did you start filling up?  No, of course not.  Did you say, hey, the line.  I know where to draw the line.  Did you say, hey, the line starts here, ladies.  Did you have a penis vein popping out?  No.  No.  No.  His version of the story is not true.  No.  I know.  I don't know.  He asked a girl for a kiss.  Who did I ask for a kiss?  I don't know her name, and I'm not going to implicate her.  No, exactly.  We're on the air.  No, you don't have facts. 
[00:52:30]  Are you on the prowl?  No.  Are you single, man?  You guys don't have the facts here.  Single and ready to mingle?  No, you guys don't have the facts.  You guys are just trying to get me in trouble.  You didn't say, am I the only one with mistletoe on my belt buckle?  I didn't have mistletoe on my belt buckle.  But did you say that?  I said there was a guy I worked with who would walk around at Christmas parties, office parties,  holiday parties.  He didn't do this whole set up.  Yes, I did.  That's bullshit.  I said it.  He said, hey, I've got a mistletoe belt buckle.  No.  And that was just a goofy thing.  No, you yelled out.  Sam Roberts is definitely saying you're full of shit.  You yelled out, am I the only one?  They're writing notes down at a party. 
[00:53:00]  I don't need to write notes.  I've got to fucking steal, trap up.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Steal, trap.  Steal, trap.  No, no, no.  We were just having fun.  It was good, clean fun.  You said, am I the only one with mistletoe on his belt buckle?  How many times have you been hauled into HR for sexual harassment charges?  Never, because I don't mean it.  Because we're just having a couple of laughs.  Dennis, that implies that you're waiting for somebody to at least kiss the tip.  No.  That's what that implies.  You know who else thought it was just fun and games?  The mayor of San Diego. 
[00:53:30]  Just having some fun.  What's the matter?  Just a few headlocks.  A few headlocks, and I'll drag you around the office, squeeze a tit.  How much pre-cum was dripping in your underpants as you were harassing the ladies at the winter gathering?  Any comments, any pre-cum?  How much pre-cum?  None.  I don't know.  I was just having a couple of laughs.  Were you spotting?  No.  Were you spotting with pre-cum?  Oh, man.  He was sitting there offering drinks to girls all the time.  Nobody would accept.  Thank God.  No.  How bad did you want one of these young ladies to squeeze your balls? 
[00:54:00]  That's nice.  I'm doing the jokes because you guys are just laughing and ripping on me all the time.  That's what these guys do all day.  Just laughing.  Roland walks around with a megaphone all day, yelling at me.  Yeah, but he's not sexually harassing people.  Oh, shit.  He knows where the line is.  He walked by my desk yesterday and broke wind.  He did.  That's not sexual harassment.  Oh, God.  That's harassing me.  That could be some type of sexual harassment.  That's harassment.  The security lady who works in her office is right next to Denny's.  I think they put him there because of all the harassment complaints. 
[00:54:30]  No, there's no harassment complaints.  But she was so pissed at Roland because she walked into her office and smelled Roland gas.  Oh, my God.  Really?  She starts going, pew, pew.  And she's like this Jamaican or Caribbean lady.  She called him the most disgusting man.  That's disgusting.  She said, you got the nastiest ass in the building.  Oh, wow.  He throws football and knocks hot tea all over me.  I don't feel complaining.  It's fun.  What's going on back there?  What the fuck is going on back there?  No surprise that nothing gets done around here.  Roland desperately needs control in his life. 
[00:55:00]  That's no secret.  But nothing that Roland does was worse than Denny asking girls who are in their 20s  who have worked here for less than a year to jump up on the photocopy machine.  No, it wasn't girls.  No, it wasn't girls.  It was a girl.  It's like the Nuremberg hearings here.  I didn't do anything wrong.  Is she around today?  No.  I want to get her side of this.  She may be.  Maybe she can call in or something.  Yeah, let's have her call in, please.  I want to hear this.  No, it was just fun.  Good clean fun.  Good clean fun.  Did you enjoy the ping pong match? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, I'm not really a big ping pong fan.  Well, who is?  Really, when you think about it.  But knowing that guy, he probably set up cameras to make sure everyone was watching him play  ping pong.  So you're in trouble if you weren't watching the big match and make him believe you cared  about it.  I was upstairs by the cupcakes and then just having a...  Yeah, you just should call the girls.  That's such a madman thing.  I know, right?  Come here, cupcake.  Call the office workers cupcakes.  Yeah.  Hey, cupcake, come here. 
[00:56:00]  You do?  You like that show, Mad Men?  I really never got into it.  How many fannies have you pinched around here in your tenure?  A fanny?  You ever smack a girl's fanny as she walked by?  No.  You don't put your hands on anyone.  You call her toots?  How many girls did you force to sit on your lap as you're programming the holiday channel?  None.  Ask for suggestions from the girls.  Come here, sit on my lap and give me a 60s song.  You know what's very telling about Denny's sense of humor?  We had, in diversity training, this is true, Denny, in diversity training, everybody has 
[00:56:30]  to go.  Uh-huh.  And I heard at Denny's session.  He heard.  Yeah.  And then you tell me that this is not true.  Uh-huh.  That there was something about sexually harassing female co-workers.  And Denny raised his hand.  No, it wasn't sexually harassing.  Okay, tell me what the context was.  It was, it wasn't, it was like, you can't have them do something.  I don't know.  Okay, but it was.  We were talking about.  It was the way you treat female co-workers.  Okay.  And Denny raised his hand.  All co-workers.  And said, hey, does this also apply to interns? 
[00:57:00]  It was just a joke.  It was just a boobie lie.  It was just in the middle of diversity training.  But it doesn't work.  Denny loves the joke.  Why would you say this for the air?  Then you wouldn't be a shitty fucking part-time weekend jock.  You got good material.  You just got to start working blue, Denny.  No semblance of context.  None.  That's fantastic.  You know what?  I wouldn't hurt a soul in the world, and they know that.  Because to me, I'm just a fun guy.  As long as they keep their ass on that photocopier, you know we're getting hurt.  Right, ladies.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Words hurt, Denny. 
[00:57:30]  That's what you got to understand.  Oh, come on.  You guys hurt me all day long.  We do.  Sal calls me old man.  Pops.  Pops.  Well, the fuck who calls anyone Pops?  I don't run to H.R.  He's calling me old man.  To be fair, you're quite a bit older than Sal.  Okay, fine.  But, you know.  You could be his grandfather.  You know that.  Easily.  Easily, right?  Easily.  We just happened to a couple of laughs at the holiday gathering.  It was you laughing.  Everybody else was laughing in disbelief.  He was there.  Not at like, oh, Denny's a riot.  It was like, holy shit. 
[00:58:00]  Where did this guy come from?  No.  All right, Denny.  It sounds like everyone had a great time, though.  The guy that doesn't work blue on the radio is the most outrageous person around here.  He was by far the most outrageous person.  When the mics are off.  I bet they thought you were a shock jock.  I bet people were like, what station is he on?  What channel is he on?  He's a shock jock.  Do we have a shock jock channel around here?  This is shock jockery.  Eric, do you think Denny was the most outrageous person at the party?  Yeah.  By far, right?  By far.  By far.  Everybody was having a great time, too.  It wasn't like everybody was like, oh, I got to watch what I say. 
[00:58:30]  Everybody was just having a good time.  Chilling out and enjoying each other's company.  We're just loosening up.  We're just loosening up.  Loosening up.  Get up on the copy machine.  Look, there's a...  I also heard, and this is hearsay, so...  Uh-oh.  Denny may or may not have walked up to Sway.  Uh-oh.  Dropping the M-bombs?  Well, might as well.  Of course not.  He may or may not have walked up to Sway and said,  Hey, I love you on Hip Hop Nation.  Aren't you Ed Lover? 
[00:59:00]  I did not say that.  That is false.  They all look alike, right?  They all look alike, right, Denny?  That's the joke, isn't it?  No.  What did you do then?  No.  I didn't go up to Sway and say that to him.  I said, did you throw the game?  I said, that's true.  Eric, what's the story then?  Because Eric is the one who told me.  He rocked comments.  He came up.  He was upstairs again.  I said Fab Five Freddy.  And he said this in front of myself,  Roland hits one people.  Uh-huh.  And he goes,  Sometimes I'll go up to black guys and say, 
[00:59:30]  Hey, are you Ed Lover?  I love you on Backspin.  No, I did not say black guys.  That's a funny joke, though.  I wouldn't get Roland in here.  But not at the party.  I would not do that.  But not at the party, Dennis.  Wow.  Everybody's just trying to have a good time.  No, they're just ripping on me because that's what they do.  Let's rip on Denny.  Your natural ability is to work blue.  I don't know what you're ready for.  I know.  You should just embrace it.  It's supposed to be a judgment-free zone at the party.  That's why it's not a Christmas party.  Right.  That's what I'm talking about.  Just a couple of laughs. 
[01:00:00]  Look at that juice.  Some juice in there.  Some juice walking down the hall.  You like that, Denny?  I didn't see it, Denny.  I don't care.  Tell her to hop up on a photocopier.  I'll face I'm home with you.  There'll be a lot of toner in that photocopier.  He saw, but he's back to workplace.  Work hours, Denny.  He put the mistletoe back in the drawer.  Let's make believe the Winter Gathering is still happening, and he'd have a lot to say  about that ass that we just saw.  No, I didn't.  Roland, what do you got to add to the Denny thing?  I don't know. 
[01:00:30]  He's had a great time.  He cracked me up.  Hey, honey, you want a kiss on the lips?  Not those lips.  No, I didn't.  I'm not saying it wouldn't be entertaining to listen to Dennis Falcone be outrageous,  but I'm very surprised by this.  Hilarious.  He's told us many times he doesn't work blue on the radio.  And the context is so off.  I didn't say any foul language right now.  We should have a Dennis Falcone tequila and donut day.  He participated in tequila and donut day.  Yes, he did.  He is a trooper.  He's done everything we've asked except for a curse on the radio.  I don't like to do that. 
[01:01:00]  He's got that, but you're right.  He doesn't curse, but he's got that old school mentality of, yes, women are there to be harassed.  But that's not saying, not cursing is saying like, oh, I make sure I don't get a speeding ticket,  but you're a serial killer.  It doesn't matter.  All right, we got Lauren on line one.  This is one of the many girls you harassed yesterday.  It's not many girls.  Good morning, Lauren.  How are you?  Hey, good morning.  You okay, Lauren, this morning?  I know you were a little shaky last night after your interaction with Dennis.  I'm a little shaky, but I got over it. 
[01:01:30]  I'm okay.  I slept it off.  Now, without like, you know, doing like fake radio crap, what was, what did he say to you exactly?  Okay, we were almost sitting upstairs by the cupcake area, and he was like four beers in  at this time.  Four beers.  And out of nowhere, he turns to me and he says, hey, Lauren, we're going to get up on that  copy or make a copy of that ass.  I did not say, I didn't say, I did not say.  It's even worse.  No, no, no, Lauren, I did not say that word. 
[01:02:00]  I said the, I might have said, but maybe.  Okay, now the story's already changing, because he said before, he didn't say, but.  Right.  Right.  You're like in denial mode, because for the last two hours last night, you were going around  to everybody, and Eric could vouch for this, and so could Tommy.  You were saying, I didn't do that.  And then your number of beers that you drank went down from five to three to two.  It went down from three, it was three beers.  People saw you with three, and I saw a photo of you double fisting.  So those two were right there.  Take a picture.  Okay.  Let's all take a picture. 
[01:02:30]  It was all goofy stuff.  Lauren, you know I wouldn't hurt you, right?  I love that.  Lauren, you know I wouldn't hurt you.  Lauren, you know that we're just having fun, right?  On the record, Lauren.  On the record.  You never want to have to say, Lauren, you know I wouldn't hurt you.  I wouldn't hurt you.  This is meant to be.  I'm not hurting you.  I'm not hurting you.  I'm not hurting you.  And it was all fun last night, but it was quite amazing.  Lauren, I need you to walk down to the lobby with me.  E-Rock, comment with Lauren on the phone.  Right after this incident happened was when Denny was drinking his beer,  leaning on that little part of the wall.  And, Lauren, did he not say when this girl walked past, kiss, kiss, how about a kiss? 
[01:03:00]  Well, this is what happened.  After he sent that comment to me, that's what started off everything.  Oh, yeah.  And as girls, these are girls that we don't work with.  They're different from the 36th floor.  These are people that are, like, you know, stuffier business suit type on the 37th floor.  And as these girls were passing, he was saying all these comments, like,  Hey, baby, how about a kiss?  Don't you remember saying that?  I don't.  I didn't say that.  Oh, boy.  What happens?  Does he black out after a couple beers? 
[01:03:30]  No, I didn't do anything.  Why are the stories so different?  One beer is a blackout for Denny.  Yes.  I would have to believe my guys and Lauren over you.  Okay, fuck.  There's too many stories coming.  No, I said, how about a cupcake?  How about a cup?  We were giving out cupcakes to everybody.  Remember all the cupcakes there?  You don't blame the victim.  You don't call the victim a liar.  She's not the victim.  She was a victim.  She got asked.  She was one of the cupcakes.  Why?  She was asking for it because of how she was dressed?  No, of course.  No, no.  Are you one of those guys?  No, no, not at all.  She wanted to get dead ass on top of the coffee machine. 
[01:04:00]  Not at all.  Just joking around.  Just having a few laughs.  Just having some fun.  Nobody got hurt.  That's all.  No one got hurt.  They're going to implement the Dennis Falcone rule.  Oh, Jesus.  The Dennis Falcone rule.  It's in the handbook.  It's in the handbook next year.  Addendum.  It was just fun.  By the way, Dennis is so weird because he was conscious enough as this was happening  to look at me and know that I was going to come on the air with this tomorrow.  And he didn't stop.  But I was just with him.  He was a madman on a mission just full of testosterone and cum. 
[01:04:30]  We just had a good time.  No, it was nothing like that.  Lauren, people in Palatoga want to know, did you copy that ass?  Great question.  No, I did not.  My managers and bosses were there.  Yeah, that would have been a little awkward.  So were Dennis's.  It didn't stop him.  No, it was just something out of Mad Men like you guys were in Sydney.  Just a goofy thing.  You didn't watch that show.  No, but it was just something.  I know it took place in the 60s, early 60s.  Lauren.  Yes.  Were you around when he started making claims about his belt buckle? 
[01:05:00]  Oh, yes.  I wanted to mention that to Obey and you guys.  Thank you.  Actually, my manager brought this up later and he was laughing his head off about it.  But he said, hey, ladies, I have a mistletoe belt.  Who wants to be the first?  No, no, no.  I did not say that.  I said that.  I didn't say that.  You guys hear these things.  I didn't say that.  I said I worked with a guy who wore a mistletoe belt buckle.  And I said what he said.  I wouldn't do that.  I said, wouldn't it be funny if I said it? 
[01:05:30]  No, I'm not that stupid.  You didn't hear that.  Come on.  You were trying to get the tip kiss.  No, no, not at all.  Not at all.  I'm believing Lauren on this one.  Here comes the pre.  Guys.  No.  All right.  All right.  Who wants to go deep sea diving?  No.  Not at all.  Oh, Danny.  Danny.  Good for you.  Not at all.  Danny's trying to get some.  Lauren's testimony is really hanging Danny out to dry here.  Ever since...  No, no, no, no.  I love Dennis.  Dennis is a great guy.  He's funny.  He's a predator. 
[01:06:00]  No, he's...  It was all...  Really.  It was all good fun.  I mean, it got a little inappropriate.  Oh, my God.  Cousin Bruce, he's going to punch Danny in the face.  Oh, my God.  He's very protective of you.  Well, he actually...  Cousin Bruce, he actually made a comment last night out of nowhere.  He was like, I'm co-hosting the show with you guys in two weeks.  I'm like, Dennis, what are you talking about?  There was nothing said about you co-hosting the show with me and Cousin Bruce.  Did he say that?  What's that?  Yeah, he said that.  No, Bruce wants me to help him out.  But just do some stuff.  No, but did you announce to Lauren that you'd be co-hosting with him? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, Bruce, why don't you come in on one night?  He never said that.  Dennis would...  Oh, no.  Yes, he did.  He asked me yesterday.  He said he'd like me to help out on one Saturday night or one Wednesday night.  So he goes, why don't you come in and call us with me one night?  I said, I'd love to.  Wow, I think you blacked out or something.  I do, too.  I think you blacked out because Cousin Bruce does not have anybody to co-host that show  ever.  Okay, we'll see.  Oh, we'll see.  We'll see.  It's the first time for everything.  That's a threat.  No, no, we'll see.  Oh, yes.  Well, the listeners can see I chronicled the whole party on my Twitter last night. 
[01:07:00]  So if you want to check it out, it's at NYC Vixen on Twitter.  Oh, you can use this.  That was a smooth Twitter plug.  That's a great opportunity to plug.  I could learn from you, man.  I learned from the best.  I don't feel like that, so...  That's great.  That was flawless.  Oh, my God.  Ever since Dennis has grown this Tom Selleck mustache, he's just been all sexed up.  No, no, no.  You know what I mean?  No, no, no, no.  More like a Dennis Weaver. 
[01:07:30]  Got Dennis Weaver in the studio.  He's got the McCloud.  You got the McCloud.  Let's just call it the McCloud.  McCloud.  This picture tells the story, doesn't it?  Oh, shit.  What is he doing there?  He's holding the ice bucket full of beer.  And he's got a dopey smile on his face.  Everybody's ignoring him.  Right.  But he's like just the wild...  He's obviously the wild man in the party.  Somebody said, Dennis, do something funny.  So the ice was there.  I picked it up.  And I said, they sent me for ice.  You were trying to get everyone going at this party, you know?  It was good, clean fun.  Oh, look at you there with the crew. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  There you are.  Picture you up on the copy machine copying that ass.  Nice, Lauren.  Nice.  Look at the selfie with Scott there.  It was a good picture.  Oh, yeah.  It's Scott.  The professional ping pong player, apparently.  Eric had to jump into that one.  Oh, E-Rock's in there?  Yeah.  E-Rock had to get a little FaceTime?  Uh-huh.  There he is.  I like that.  I like that.  Well, that looks like a fun little party.  Sure does.  It was a fun time.  There are fun people who work here.  I wish our studio wasn't broken. 
[01:08:30]  I would have gone.  Right.  Oh, shame.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Certainly, we're going to go back to this topic.  I don't think I think you should move on.  As more stories surface.  Yes.  Yes.  Lauren, thank you for your testimony.  No problem.  Have a good one, guys.  All right.  There goes Lauren.  Bye-bye.  Okay, look at this.  This dude from Hits One right here.  His name's Tommy.  And he tweeted.  He just sent this tweet out.  Can you hear me?  Oh, boy.  What?  At Dennis Falcone is drinking and making sexually inappropriate comments at female staffers. 
[01:09:00]  Tommy was breaking my chops.  More witnesses.  More witnesses.  I don't even know who this Tommy guy is.  Exactly.  Who is he, by the way?  Because he also took a picture of our studio.  He works on Hits One.  He's a producer over at Hits One.  He's a fan of the show.  He seems like a cool guy.  Denny, are you claiming conspiracy now?  That all these people are conspiring?  I'm an easy target.  You know that.  I'm an easy target.  I'm an easy target.  You know what makes you an easy target?  You go up to young female employees and you ask them to put their ass. 
[01:09:30]  No, no, no.  Clench those asses.  I love that ass.  You guys take it.  Take a copy of that ass.  You know what makes you an easy target?  When you announce to the girls at the party that your belt is made of mistletoe.  No, again, I said I worked with a guy who would show up at a party with a mistletoe belt buckle.  Who wants to suck this dick?  A long time ago.  And that guy was you, wasn't it?  No, that was not me.  That was Mitch Kumstein.  I have a perfect record.  That old gag.  I worked for a guy that wants...  I have a perfect record and you know that.  Ladies, ladies, this Falcone cock ain't gonna suck itself. 
[01:10:00]  I do not say anything that rude and vulgar.  I'm talking to you in HR.  Come on now.  Did you point to your turgid cock and say, what are we gonna do about this?  Did you go J-moron everyone?  If I drank as much as everybody's...  I would be...  I'd miss the stop and I'd be in Riverhead by now on the train.  Did you pull your bag out through your zipper and sing Jingle Balls?  That'd be funny.  And then you'd jump around and make them jingle?  No, no.  Hey, Lauren, I know you're new around here, but what are we gonna do about this?  No. 
[01:10:30]  No, Lauren is a very good person to have on the team.  She's a good worker.  Are you sure none of this happened?  Not one bit.  Look, some funny stuff happened, yes.  Some funny stuff.  He went...  Let's go in the supply closet.  Yeah.  I would go to other friends' houses, like a party.  You know, a bunch of couples.  You ain't doing it in my house.  And I'd get up to go to the restroom.  And I'd come out with just a towel wrapped around me.  Say, is it okay if I take a shower?  You guys got any soap?  Whoa!  No, with a towel.  I said towel.  Just a towel. 
[01:11:00]  See, you...  With their towel?  Just for fun.  Your dick is on their towel?  No, no, no, no.  I was just doing something goofy.  I don't do that anymore.  It's fun.  I'm just leaving up a dicker.  Just fun.  Yeah.  Hey, is it okay if I take a shower?  I want to freshen up.  Just for the quick...  Just for the clean fun.  Just quick joke.  Opie, you have young children.  Did you get a big laugh?  Yeah, I always did.  You have young children in the house.  How would you feel if you invited Dennis over?  Well, the problem is he's not going to be invited to my house.  Never.  Oh, my God.  That's too creepy for me. 
[01:11:30]  What if Dennis and Anthony broken out his character, the naked DJ at your party?  Oh, shit.  Why didn't you do naked DJ at his?  No, because he hired me to work.  Oh, he was working.  See?  I know what you draw the line as being a professional.  He's either on the clock or on the cock.  No.  That's it.  Next time you have him DJing your party, you've got to have a point where you go,  okay, you're off the clock, you're done.  Hang out.  Hang out, and then he's going to come walking out of your bathroom with your towel on.  Oh, yeah.  And he will be fucking someone doggy style within 15 minutes in your movie theater. 
[01:12:00]  No, I wouldn't take a hold of my clothes.  I'd have lots of shorts on or something.  I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, but we...  Just fine.  But your bare chest?  Yeah, why?  Oh, Jesus.  Imagine him coming out.  Wait a second.  When people go in a pool, are they bare chest?  Well, they do.  Yeah, but when somebody...  Not in their living room.  No, and I have done that a long time, maybe when I was like 29.  Oh, there you go.  You said you would do that now.  No, I wouldn't.  You just said that.  Those people don't invite me to their house anymore.  Why?  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Because you came out in a fucking towel.  Like it was a joke.  It was just a joke. 
[01:12:30]  Just a joke.  Just having a good time with Denny, that's all.  Yeah.  That's all.  All right, Denny.  Very good.  I appreciate the time, though, guys.  Sam, I hope I gave you enough fodder for today.  Oh, boy.  Dennis, you're an endless fountain.  I love it.  Yeah.  You're a soldier.  I feel bad I missed that party.  That would have been fun to hang around and listen to Denny going off like this.  Just trying to get it sucked.  No, no, no.  However he had to get it done.  No, no.  Whoever, however.  All I want to do is make people laugh and give them a smile.  That's all.  And if you can come, then that's just a bonus. 
[01:13:00]  No, no, no, no.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  I just want people to have a good time and laugh.  Yeah, me too.  Where do you dry hump the women around here?  No, we don't do that.  Is there a closet you take them to?  The dry hump closet.  Let me show you how we program your serious success.  You don't put your hands on anyone.  Never.  That's right.  But if it's through the clothes, that doesn't count.  No, not at all.  But your elbow's a fair play.  No.  You know what I mean, right?  A little elbow tit.  Squeezing the...  It's having each other in the hallway. 
[01:13:30]  I feel like I need body armor whenever I come into this studio with you.  It's sort of the girls around here.  We never had you.  Picked it up, Denny.  I love it.  That's because you're a professional broadcaster.  Thank you for the compliment.  And I'm a broadcast professional.  And a party professional, too.  I don't need you flirting with me.  What do they call him?  The octopus?  Is that it?  Oh, he's all over.  Well, again, how many hands does he have?  No, no.  No hands.  If there is one word to describe Denny, it's handsy.  But whatever I say to these lines, it's like with Groucho. 
[01:14:00]  I always grab my glasses or something.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, how are you?  Yeah, but nobody ever called into a radio show to say,  Groucho Marx made me feel sexually uncomfortable at the workplace last night.  No, she did not say that.  She did not say that.  And the secret word is intercourse.  Oh, shit.  Quack, quack.  Yeah, you kind of got it like a Groucho thing, almost.  Exactly.  Dennis Weaver-ish.  Yeah.  Except not the sense of humor, unfortunately.  Yeah, yeah.  Just the mustache.  Well, you know.  I have a pretty good sense of humor. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, yeah, you do.  Yes, I do.  Yes, you do.  People like me, you know that?  People like me.  You are John Candy, aren't you?  I've been home in years.  You're the genuine article.  Yeah.  You guys like having me on the show?  Love it.  You're the fucking man.  You come to my defense?  You're the fucking man.  I'll be hiring the team of Opie and Anthony to represent me.  Don't you worry about it.  You'll be fine.  You got to the bottom of things.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Thank you, guys.  Have a great weekend.  Thank you.  Oh, Kenny, anything? 
[01:15:00]  Can I just say one thing?  Uh-huh.  Shame on you.  Shame on you.  The Opie and Anthony show continues in moments.  In moments.  In moments.  In moments.  In moments.  Oh, God.  Funny that Patty thing.  That's great.  Santa.  I got a video of that somewhere.  I'll try to tweet.  I can't find it, though.  That in Grandpa. 
[01:15:30]  Grandpa.  Grandpa.  Grandpa.  We got Mike Machete calling in today, finally.  Oh, finally.  We got that great story of him forgetting where he lived or something. 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  Pete Davidson, a young comedian, had to drive him home.  Yeah.  So we're going to try to get Mike Machete's side of that story.  Also, we haven't really promoted it yet this week because we weren't around for a day  and a half or whatever it was.  But podcast number 31, the Opie and Anthony podcast.  31 already?  31, yes.  Amazing.  The 2006 homeless shopping spree.  Oh, boy.  Was that a good one.  Man, was it good.  Yeah.  One of the many bits that we just can't do anymore, unfortunately.  But thank God we have, you know, these recordings that we can at least get out there. 
[01:16:30]  Yes.  That was the one in Jersey.  Right.  Fez showed up.  And Fez was all over CNN as a homeless guy.  Oh, right.  Yeah, on the O'Reilly Factor and all those shows.  Oh, right.  They thought he was one of the homeless.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  2006 was the one that got the most heat, right?  We got a lot of TV coverage on that one?  Yeah.  I think that was the last one we did.  Right.  It was the best one, I think.  It was also the one we had to do on a Saturday.  Yes.  Because they wouldn't let us do it during the week. 
[01:17:00]  And I'm not...  I swear I'm all in with Tim Sabian and Don Wicklum, but I have to relay another quick  little tip.  Yeah.  And Tim goes, and I want to do a homeless shopping spree again.  Oh, that's cute.  And I just had the over-the-top Robert De Niro fucking king of comedy.  No, not even that one.  I had this one.  Ah, yeah.  This one.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Once again, he goes, come on, just give me a chance.  I'm like, I'm telling you they will not let us do the homeless shopping spree again without 
[01:17:30]  these crazy rules.  Ain't gonna happen.  Right.  You remember when, um, I forgot the guy's name that used to, uh, run the channel.  Um, he, uh, Incarnation.  I forgot.  He didn't have hair.  I remember that.  Oh, yeah.  That's, uh...  Remember he, uh...  No hair.  He's like, good news, we're gonna do the homeless shopping spree, and then he started calling  the malls for permission.  For permission.  You can't do that.  And sending out, like, contracts to the malls.  Right.  Like, you can't do that. 
[01:18:00]  That's good.  That really captures the spirit of what we were doing.  But at that point, you just gotta accept we can't do it.  You can't.  You gotta understand that would never work.  Iraq, comment?  No, I was just moving in.  But they did come up with a solution.  You're forgetting that.  They did, yes.  Well, I was trying not to beat them up too bad today.  I remember the solution.  The Costco solution?  Well, let's go ahead.  Let's open a Costco at 7 a.m.  Just for us.  So they can shop by themselves.  That suggestion got me banned from sales meetings, because I laughed at somebody.  You see?  Right.  Good for you, by the way, getting banned from those. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, wait, what's his name?  Wait, what's his name?  Wait, what's his name?  Uh, Ross, right?  I like naming names.  Ross got...  You sure do.  Ross got really mad.  He couldn't believe that...  Ooh, name, names.  He couldn't believe that we didn't see it his way.  I'm like, it's not the homeless shopping spree unless we do it in a mall and our listeners  get to show up.  What the...  That's what was in this.  Oh.  I want to thank, um, uh, this Friday the 13th.  Is this an official commercial? 
[01:19:00]  You can't just...  You're friends at Paramount Pictures.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You want to make sure you're prepared.  No, no, no, no, no.  They send you something.  It doesn't mean you get to advertise.  They don't get free advertising because they send gifts.  Oh, well, that...  Yeah, because that's, uh, illegal.  All you have to do is send me a gift and I'll plug your stuff.  No.  No, no, but you can't be involved in something that's illegal.  What?  Our wonderful sponsors pay money to have you guys mention their products.  We can't have...  We can't cheapen that.  What good is Plugola if you can't Plugola?  Plugola's not good.  No. 
[01:19:30]  Uh, Paramount Pictures want to make sure you are prepared for the release of...  I thought we got over this.  Don't worry about what's coming out.  It's the end of the year.  No one's really...  Everyone has their card.  Everyone's cool.  No, the new...  Paranormal Activity, the marked ones, in theaters on January 3rd, 2014.  The last Paranormal Activity was terrible.  In close, please find all the essential safeguards your local...  That's so stupid.  Uh, botanica can provide to protect you from black magic.  We encourage you to cleanse your spirit and ward off any bad luck or darkness.  Hopefully this way you will get to see... 
[01:20:00]  I'm into that.  ...2014.  Uh, all right.  I guess there's...  What's in the box?  Like, uh, some kind of anti-ghost things?  It's one of those boxes I don't know how to open, though.  Yeah.  How do you open this type?  Which way does it open?  Where's the flap?  Well, the flaps are, like, tucked in and then, like...  What do you do?  You just pull hard?  I don't know.  Yeah, why not?  I'm not going to keep this crap.  I mean, this great...  Oh, there you go.  Now, uh, this will protect you from paranormal activity.  What's that?  A jar?  Oh, very good.  Spooky.  I'm going to pee in that in a minute. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, man.  What's that for?  Oh, man.  Holy water.  It's like you're going to make fucking, uh...  I'm going to make shit.  Some freebase.  Oh, maybe that's a jar.  What is that?  Give this to Dennis.  I'm sure he could shove it up some girl's ass.  The next office party.  It's a soft egg.  What?  A soft egg?  What's that for?  And a candle.  Oh, you got a candle in here.  A candle.  So you could burn that.  Okay.  What is this to protect you?  And what is that?  The marked ones in theaters January 3rd. 
[01:21:00]  Protection oil.  Protection oil.  Can you use that for ass lube?  Because you might want to give that to Denny, too.  Yeah, let's do that.  Denny might need that.  Sam, it just says the marked ones in theaters January 3rd.  Protection oil.  Any copy machine paper?  Just tell the people what it is.  Don't worry about what it is.  This isn't even...  This doesn't make any sense.  You're copying that ass.  That ass.  You want that ass copy?  That ass.  That's so funny.  Take that shit home with me.  You like this shit?  What is that?  What do you do?  It's holy water.  That could come in handy. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  Vampires.  That's some evil coin.  What is that?  What is that?  Oh, our lady of Guadalupe, mystical rose, make intercession for a holy church.  Protect the sovereign pontiff.  Help all those who invoke thee in the...  Don't say it.  Oh, no.  ...in their necessities.  And since thou art the ever virgin Mary, a mother of the true God.  Updating from the Necromonicon.  Updating for us from the most holy son, the grace of keeping our faith.  Rata. 
[01:22:00]  Sweet hope in the midst of bitterness of life, burning charity, and the precious gift of final  perseverance.  That's scary.  I'm hoping to get some voice work.  Yeah?  That's why I did that.  Oh.  Add it to the demo reel.  For a scary movie?  Yeah, scary movie shit.  Damn.  And I guess this is how to protect yourself from paranormal activity in ten steps.  So you only need a candle, some holy water, and a mason jar?  Yeah, and you say those words I did.  How about how to protect yourself from paranormal activity is to stay away from the fucking movie 
[01:22:30]  theater.  And what...  Yeah.  And what's with the cushy egg?  I don't know.  Like, what are you supposed to do with that?  It doesn't explain what you do with all this stuff.  That doesn't make sense.  I don't know.  It's just whatever.  All right.  You don't have to open up your box.  I hate when they give us the same shit.  Right in the fucking...  Especially when it's garbage.  I got twin brothers in my family, but I now understand their life.  Yeah.  Because me and Ann always get the same fucking shit. 
[01:23:00]  Same thing.  Oops.  Uh-oh.  Good break.  Sounded broke.  No, it's all right.  I want to thank Dr. Steve for the bottle of wine he sent me.  And boy, did I go right on wine.com.  And it looks like Dr. Steve had a fine year.  Dr. Steve sent you a bottle of wine?  At home.  It was sent to your home?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I sent him a NutriBullet.  What the hell's that?  Oh, that thing.  My smoothie thing.  The mixer thing.  Oh, man.  Dr. Steve.  I got you.  You know what I got you?  Nothing.  Well, the problem with Dr. Steve is he can't accept a good gesture without doing a good gesture 
[01:23:30]  back immediately.  Reciprocating.  Yes.  So, because I gave him a NutriBullet, he's like, oh, I got to give him a bottle of wine.  It's like, no, just accept my little gift.  You said you liked making smoothies, so I gave you my NutriBullet, which I love.  What kind of wine?  I forgot the name, but I looked it right up.  It's nice.  It's got that fancy font where it's really hard to read what it says at first.  Oh, that's a good wine right there.  That's a good wine right there.  You know how I tell a good wine?  The price. 
[01:24:00]  That's all I do.  Oh, yeah, of course.  I walk into the store.  I go, if I want a good bottle of wine, I get like a $75, $80 bottle of wine.  Right.  If I want a pretty good bottle of wine, $30 range there, something like that.  And then the cheap shit's like $8, $10, $15.  But there's a wine store in my neighborhood, and they will tell you why that's all bullshit.  I don't drink a lot of wine these days, but I started going in there because I was buying  Duckhorn and Silver Oak.  The wine people know.  Oh, yeah.  Those are like, they're almost $100 a bottle in the liquor store. 
[01:24:30]  So I finally go to this place, what is it called, Wine 67, I forget the name, on Columbus  Avenue, and they have a wine person in there, and they go, all right, what do you buy at  a regular liquor store?  And I tell them, they're like, ha, ha, ha.  And they go, yeah, of course that's good stuff, but let me show you something that's  just as good for, I can't even say half, like a third of the price.  And I go, well, why is it only this much?  And they're like, because no one knows about it yet.  So they can't charge $100 a bottle yet. 
[01:25:00]  That's odd.  And I picked up some amazing wines for a lot fucking cheaper.  I have noticed, though, in my wine tastings that the more expensive wine does taste a  little better.  Yeah.  In general.  Yeah.  In general.  But there's also a lot of, I'm sure there's some, you know.  There's a lot of new players, but they just can't, no one knows about them, so they can't  charge a lot of money.  Got no traction yet.  Right.  So I ended up saving a lot of money thanks to that place.  Yeah.  And it was all stuff I'd never heard of. 
[01:25:30]  Never.  And it was like $15, $20.  I'm like, really?  And they're like, trust me.  And I did.  And, you know, in most cases, it was absolutely really good.  Whatever.  Good stuff, Dr. Steve.  That's always good when you end a segment with whatever.  What?  Is that something they teach you in broadcasting school?  Just end your sentence with whatever.  That means you have no confidence in what you just said.  Great.  Great.  Whatever.  Ah, shit. 
[01:26:00]  We were talking about Christmas and how it's a dirty word these days.  Oh, it certainly is.  And everyone's just losing their minds over it.  Yes.  Very politically incorrect to even talk about Christmas.  Yeah, not a hint.  I dropped my kid off yesterday.  I wanted to make sure, and not a hint of a Christmas decoration in the classroom.  No?  That is just fucking weird to me, man.  That's the little kid from Christmas Story? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Holy shit, he's a man.  What do you mean?  That's the put-your-eye-out-kid, kid.  But he's like a man.  Looks like Jim Chandler.  Does he?  Oh.  Looks like my old pal Jim Chandler.  Pal.  Yeah, we're pals again.  Oh, good.  I like everything that he tweets and Instagrams.  Everything?  Yeah, even if I don't like it.  Oh.  Oh, like he clicked like.  I'm really sucking up as much as I can to him.  You see the new blocking policy on Twitter?  No.  Did they change it and then change it back? 
[01:27:00]  I just heard about the change.  I haven't heard about no change back yet.  Apparently, now when you block somebody, they can still see everything you're tweeting.  But you no longer see anything that they write.  So it's like backwards blocked.  Yeah.  So, but they are never informed that you have blocked them.  So it saves you from having to read their drivel and they don't know when you block them. 
[01:27:30]  So they can't just make a new account and harass you and things like that.  That was Twitter's logic with the whole thing is, well, it keeps them from just perpetually harassing because they don't know they were blocked anyway.  Anyway, so I don't know if it works.  I like the satisfaction of blocking someone and, you know, you cannot now read my magic, my words of wisdom, my eloquence, my comedy.  Just say you're brilliance.  Brilliance. 
[01:28:00]  All right.  I like that.  Well, the gift of at Anthony Cumia is something.  The gift.  Why?  Right.  It's a privilege.  Why do I want to keep giving them the gift?  The gift.  Like chlamydia.  I just got a communique from Stephen Singer himself.  Oh, wow.  I told you we were pals.  It's no bullshit.  Stephen Singer.  He writes, we own the whole building.  Oh.  Lest you say he doesn't own the whole building. 
[01:28:30]  But in this text, I think he's in agreement that he doesn't want you to drop deuces in his building.  No, no one wants to come in to buy a diamond ring from Stephen Singer Jewelers and then smell wafting shit in the room.  He writes, would you let someone like you behind the counter with the diamonds?  A lot of question marks.  That's why I'm shouting.  Oh, boy.  And then he writes, I barely let you in the showroom.  You know what happens?  And then he writes, you are the best.  You know what happens when you take a big dump like that and then add millions of years of heat and pressure? 
[01:29:00]  Huh.  Turns into a big, hard diamond.  Yeah.  So maybe he's collecting duties.  That's what I'm thinking.  And putting it into a big pressure cooker.  Big pressure cooker.  He's a long-term guy.  Oh, yeah.  He looks at the big picture.  Yes.  I actually like going down there.  It's fun.  The whole area is kind of cool.  Yeah.  Twitter.  Yeah, absolutely.  I've never been down there.  You've got to go.  Oh, yeah, you do.  You've got to go for the tour.  It's pretty amazing.  Kiladelphia, yo.  Yeah.  They did have to change their shit because everybody, all the Twitter users were like, 
[01:29:30]  no, I don't want people I block seeing my stuff.  They changed it back?  So they changed it back.  Wow.  Like Coke, new Coke, and then classic Coke.  Except they only took a few hours.  They only took a few hours.  All right.  It pissed everybody off.  I know.  It really got a mess.  So now it's just how it was?  Yes.  Same as the devil was.  But everybody got really upset because, yeah, when you block people, you don't want them  to get to see the gifts of brilliance that you bestow upon the internet.  I kind of see their point, though. 
[01:30:00]  If you block somebody, and they don't know they're blocked by you, and you can no longer  read what they write, who cares what they write then?  And they probably won't start new accounts to keep harassing you.  That was their whole point.  But we have this thing where we need to say, no, I want to take something away from you.  It's supposed to be a punishment.  Right.  I am blocking you from my, what was the word you used, Opie?  Brilliance.  Brilliance.  My brilliance.  Jesus. 
[01:30:30]  All right.  I'm going to flip that on you now.  Yeah?  Your brilliance was very evident in the old Howard Stern video that I posted on my YouTube  page.  There it is.  I forgot about that.  That's doing really well, by the way.  I want to thank Brian, our old intern at AF.  Man.  I got a lot of the Real Rock TV tapes, but he's finding stuff I don't even have.  He's finding gold nuggets.  You know what one I want badly, and I told him, but maybe someone else that might have  been taping back then.  We didn't have as many tapers as we do nowadays. 
[01:31:00]  But I want the TV piece we did where we killed Elmo.  You want to talk about douche chills.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  With the fake car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the wood chipper.  And the wood chipper.  I got to get that.  Oh, boy.  Was that douchey?  They're all douchey, but.  Did Ian go AWOL years ago on us?  I think so.  Yeah.  What was his issue with us?  Well, I think he had some misplaced affections.  Yeah, I think he kind of wanted to pop me in the hiney. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, because that's another way to put it.  That's how Denny would put it.  I'm going to pop you in the hiney.  I think there might have been a little something.  Yeah.  I don't know.  On his part, trust me.  Oh, boy.  You noticed that, too.  Oh, everybody did.  Everyone did.  Did you see the clip Brian posted of Rocco?  No, I didn't click on that one yet.  It was pretty good, because at one point, Rocco in the clip just goes,  Hey, hey, dude, really loud and long. 
[01:32:00]  Is it worth playing on the radio?  Well, to get a little taste of Rocco.  Yeah.  If you want a little taste of Rocco.  And you've got to play the Ant doing the Howard thing, too, because that works as a radio bit.  That was, I have a, where'd they get that wig?  It's perfect.  It's a big, giant, 1990s Howard wig.  I don't remember you doing that one.  I don't either.  But then again, I was intoxicated most of the time to get away from my wife.  Right.  Yeah, that one I saw, the Howard thing, the Howard one I saw on one of the tapes. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  Oh, wow.  And that goes through an entire episode.  Like, it keeps...  Oh, I keep going back to Howard.  Yeah, so he edited it nicely into one quick minute video.  Which you can find on my YouTube channel.  Yeah.  Where's the Rocco thing?  So, how you feeling, man?  Oh, that's...  How you feeling, man?  How you feeling, man?  How you feeling, man?  Is this one?  Rockhole?  Probably, Rockhole.  Yeah, it might be.  Hey, Rocco's psychotic line ringing.  Aw, look at Rocco.  Hello, hello, this is Rocco. 
[01:33:00]  Yes, the psychiatric network.  This is Rocco's psychotic network, kid, psychotic.  I'm sorry, I've never called one of these before.  What's your name?  My name's Bob.  Bob, what's your birthday?  Let me see if I can help you.  Two, uh, 14 in 1973.  I'm 21, I can drink.  Can you now?  Yeah.  You were born on Valentine's Day?  Yeah.  What's your problem there, Bob? 
[01:33:30]  Every time I take off my pants in front of my girlfriend, she laughs.  It's classic, dude.  So what you're saying is if you took an inch off your penis, you would have a pimple on  your ass.  Dude, I bet you I can tell your girlfriend's name.  Oh, that's a good dude.  Okay.  Ginger.  What the?  How'd you know that?  Dude, I know all. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, God.  It's the Rocco, dude.  Dude.  Rest in peace, brother.  Rest in peace.  We lost to Rocco a couple years ago.  I banana my Rocco.  Yeah, Rocco's dead.  I gotta say, we hated that we had to do bits with the other fucking guys at the station.  So bad.  We hated they were part of the TV show.  We hated that they were part of the CDs.  Then we finally branched out and was able to get a CD of just our stuff out there.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's so weird watching, looking at that. 
[01:34:30]  He's got the mullet crank in.  It's fucking...  I remember that studio so vividly.  And look, the Denon fucking CD player.  Same CD player.  It's the same CD players we're using right here.  There you go.  That's about 95, 96 right there.  Yeah, there you go.  96 probably.  And they were old.  Look at all the carts behind them.  Dude, I fucking totally remember sitting there.  Oh, God.  It was a million years ago.  So excited to be doing radio. 
[01:35:00]  It was great.  We're still excited, right, guys?  I'm so excited.  I can't hide it.  Good.  I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it.  The one bad thing about doing a podcast every week, you got to fucking read the tweets.  God, you guys really were into it a few years ago.  Oh, jeez.  We're still into it.  2014 is going to be a big, big year for this show.  Don't worry about it.  Relaunch.  Everything is going to be great.  It's going to be relaunched.  You guys are going to come back strong.  Yeah.  You're going to enjoy the show.  Things are going to get done. 
[01:35:30]  You're going to re-sign in October.  Oh, boy.  Resign?  Spelt the same, isn't it?  It is.  Isn't re-sign and resign spelt the same?  Sure.  And they're so close right now.  And it means the complete opposite of each other.  What the fuck?  Do Anthony's impression of Howard from the old days, from our Real Rock TV.  I'll say it, our Real Rock TV show.  Not the station's.  The visual aspect is the old dark studio from an overhead cam, and I got a giant Howard 
[01:36:00]  wig on and the sunglasses.  Right.  So it's supposed to, you know, look like it.  Ooh!  Did you see that, Robert?  Another blatant example of how they're ripping me off.  I'm an innovator.  No one's ever original anymore.  That was obviously a blatant rip-off of me, the king of everything.  I'm disgusted.  Oh, boy.  Okay, we're back, and I have some more.  I'm being ripped off again, Robin.  Have you heard this WAF Real Rock TV?  They're filming inside the radio station with video cameras. 
[01:36:30]  Who thought of that, Robin?  Me.  Howard.  I invented the video camera, and now they've got this Real Rock TV, where they're going  to be showing behind the scenes at a radio station.  It's an outrageous rip-off, Robin.  Well, we're out of time again.  Wow, where did the time go, Robin?  I've got to get the plugs in, catch Jerky the Jackman at the Bayonne Comedy Toilet, and  our interview with Stammering Jim tomorrow, where he actually kicks Mother Teresa. 
[01:37:00]  It's hysterical.  I'd like to thank all of my guests today, and Robin, I want to thank you, and most of  all, I want to thank me.  And we'll see you next time.  Are we done?  Hey, Robin, that Real Rock TV, the tape I saw, it's really not that bad.  It's a pretty good show, actually.  I think I got some ideas from that.  And then he walks away. 
[01:37:30]  That's an extremely accurate impression.  Extremely.  It's a giant wig.  Yep.  We've got to take a break, because we went really long with the first break.  Oh.  And then we're going to come back with Mike Buschetti on the phone.  Nice.  He's been waiting pretty much three days to talk to us.  Oh, yeah.  So we'll talk to him next about not being able to tell Pete Davidson where he lives.  That's great.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:38:00]  Same as it ever was.  Same as it ever was.  Letting a day go by.  Water flowing under.  I like the talking heads.  There's water at the bottom of the ocean.  Yes.  Living in a shotgun shack.  You may find yourself in another part of the world.  And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a man.  With that giant suit he's wearing. 
[01:38:30]  Stop making sense.  Stop making sense.  That is it.  Yeah.  With a beautiful wife.  And you may ask yourself.  Well.  Well.  How did I get here?  Nice.  That song's never made sense, but.  I like.  I like the earlier talking heads.  I like that shit.  You know what?  David Byrne.  Is it David Byrne?  Was that his name?  Yeah.  Just kind of wanders around like the village.  He's like a.  Like Uber New York City artist.  Oh really? 
[01:39:00]  Doesn't really make a lot of music.  Or music that we would know of, I guess.  He was always a weirdo, man.  Of course he was a weirdo.  Good stuff, though.  So.  Psycho killer.  Que ce que c'est.  So you have this guy, Pete Davidson.  He was on the after show with Sam Roberts.  And he relayed a little story about Mike Bichetti, who's standing by.  But we got a clip from that appearance.  Yes.  Just to set this up for everybody.  It's quick. 
[01:39:30]  So.  Do we have permission to air this?  I hope so.  Do we have written express permission from Sam Roberts?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I generally don't like my stuff being played on other shows.  Christ.  Hoo hoo.  Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo.  Insane.  I met him.  So you're 17.  At this club called the Looney Bin.  Mm-hmm.  In Staten Island.  And we did a show.  He's talking about Mike Bichetti, obviously.  Mm-hmm.  For the people that weren't listening earlier.  And I had to drive him home.  And he doesn't know where he lives.  What?  No, this is a true story. 
[01:40:00]  Like we were.  He was like, yeah, I live on Forest Avenue.  And we went to Forest Avenue.  And he goes, Pete, this is so embarrassing.  And I was like, I don't live here anymore.  And I was like, where do you live, Mike?  He goes, I live by a gas station.  And I was like, there's a lot of gas stations.  A gas station.  But it's in Staten Island.  It's in Staten Island.  So there's only 30 gas stations that we have to drive by.  But no, it was.  So how did you find his place?  We had to call his mom.  No.  And his mom was like, Michael, how long have we been living? 
[01:40:30]  He's like 48.  I'm not sure what you're saying.  He's an adult man.  So he was like, Michael, how long have we lived at this house?  And he goes, oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  And then you're going like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  And then I just went home after that and went to school the next day.  So there you have it.  That's bizarre, man.  So I said to Sam, we got to get Mike Pichetti on the freaking show.  Get his side.  To get his side of the story.  Yeah.  So without further ado, we welcome Mike Pichetti to the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up, Mike? 
[01:41:00]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  How are you?  All right.  We're doing all right, man.  You know, the holidays are right around the corner.  We're shopping.  Oh, boy.  Oh, guys, I hate shopping for the holidays.  I just, like, send my brother out to get stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't like going shopping.  I can't stomach at the beginning, guys.  It's like, and it's even worse now.  Why can't you stomach Christmas shopping?  I like Christmas, but it's like, you know, people are all over the place.  They're pushing and shoving.  It's like when it rains out in Midtown.  The umbrella people, I call them.  I just, like, don't like having it that much. 
[01:41:30]  I just want to be in and out and just throw it fast, you know?  Are you a little agoraphobic?  I could be, yes.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I am.  Anthony, that's right, because I forgot, you know, like, I don't really like, believe it or not,  I'm kind of shy when it comes to not being a comic, but I know what you mean by agoraphobic.  I was like, you know, if I stand around people for two, you know what I mean, I get kind of awkward.  So you don't believe in the baby Jesus?  No, I totally do.  I love him.  He's one of my, you know, he's the number one guy. 
[01:42:00]  You love the baby Jesus.  You're all in with that, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like the holidays a lot, but I just hate to stress to them.  Yeah.  So what happened with Pete Davidson?  Oh, he's a character.  I love Pete.  First of all, I met him.  He's a great comic.  I met him about, like, three or four years ago.  He started comedy at about 15.  So what happened was, I had moved recently a couple of times on Staten Island in the past, you know, couple years.  And where I live now, oh, God, I'll describe this area to you guys. 
[01:42:30]  It's like the Witness Protection Program where I am.  I'm at the end of my block, the dead end street.  Hardly anybody speaks English here.  I'm on the third floor living up in an attic to my mother's house here.  It's ridiculous.  I feel like I'm in another country where I'm at times on it.  What do you mean by they don't speak English?  What do they speak?  Probably, it could be Russian or Slobic.  A lot of Russians, yeah.  A lot of former Soviet fucking republics. 
[01:43:00]  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  And I just, you know, it could be Albanian.  I don't know.  They all speak pretty close to the same stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, those people are very scary, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I see them, I see the fathers at the playgrounds here in New York City.  Yeah.  I'm way more scared of them than black people.  The Russians than black people.  Let's be honest with you.  Huh?  I'm scared more of them than the Italians.  They are fucking intimidating.  No, they wouldn't.  And they're at the playground with their young children, which is just all festive and nice, 
[01:43:30]  but how they talk, even in those circumstances, you know they mean business.  They would kill you.  Right.  I'm into people, they're obnoxious, they're like, I don't know.  I am scared of them, it's right, because I'm a fact, I just don't want to be tied to a  log on the Hudson River.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, they are a little nasty when they drive their stupid pedicabs around.  A lot of Russians doing that.  I can't even fit in one, but it's like.  Yeah, the guy would fucking just be like, oh boy, this is not going anywhere. 
[01:44:00]  No, he'd be like, oh no, I got to go to my chiropractor.  Yes.  They look cool to ride in, but I know I could never fit, get in and out of one night.  Do they really look cool to ride in though?  They look horrendous.  I want a heater.  I want fast transportation.  I want a little bit of metal around me just in case something happens.  Those fucking things.  You couldn't get me in one of those things if it was the only way to get around.  No fucking way. 
[01:44:30]  I'm having some guy pedal me up and down the streets.  What year is this, first of all?  And where are we?  Saigon?  I don't need it.  This is an 1812 Manchuria.  Yes, Manchuria.  And they're more expensive than a cab ride.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like way more expensive.  So you're out in the freezing cold going, what, five miles an hour to your destination?  Yeah.  And then you get out and it's like a hundred bucks.  I can crawl faster.  I told one guy, he came by me twice once, and he goes, right? 
[01:45:00]  I'm like, no, I said, I'm going to fucking Brooklyn.  Right.  You want to pedal your ass across the fucking bridge?  And then he got all pissed at me.  Oh, no, and they're obnoxious.  Fuck you, you fucking.  He said that?  Yeah, yeah, he got mad.  We squared off.  Almost had a fight.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I love this.  You're Italian, like, man, I love it.  We got that, like, you know, like, I got that, like, you know, if you say no,  shouldn't somebody want to, should we know?  I don't want to ride.  I'm nice, right?  Yeah, yeah, they just keep going around the block and looking at you. 
[01:45:30]  And the dirt, I know, they make you feel like you're on display.  Those guys and the guys that try to sell you the rose when you're with a girl.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, man, rose, rose for the lovely lady.  You can shut up.  Don't try to put me up on the spot.  Yeah.  Jerk off.  And then you look like a piece of shit because you didn't buy the rose.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not buying your shitty rose.  So, Pete, that's where you live now?  You live in the attic of your mom's house?  Yeah, or Mike, but, yeah.  Why the attic?  Who's living in the rest of the house? 
[01:46:00]  Oh, it's a great situation.  Me and my brother, my brother.  It's a great situation.  Yeah.  Downstairs, he, with his brother's, with his son, and then my brother has, like, a dog  downstairs.  It's like a five-pound chihuahua.  So they let the dog in the house, but not you.  You have to be in the attic.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I kind of like the attic.  Oh, I bet.  Yeah.  Does it have a window, at least?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  The window's pretty good.  Is it small?  One of those small ones?  It's medium-sized.  I can look at the back of a swamp over here. 
[01:46:30]  Do you have that roof, though, where you can only walk in the middle because it's pitched  down on each side?  I know.  It's like I was always, when I lived with my family, I was always in the attic or the basement.  I never, like, lived in a neutral floor.  You never lived in the house.  You're always...  Oh, my God.  Ah, shit.  Not good.  They always, like, keep them in the attic or the basement.  Yeah.  So the story that Pete Davidson's talking about, that's from a while ago? 
[01:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  This was probably a couple years ago.  So what happened was, I go, Pete, but, you know, he drove me home.  He started driving me home, and I go, wait a minute.  I don't live here all day.  Oh, darn.  I don't know how to get here from there.  Because we, like, way on Stead Island is, like, where's an expressway.  And I'm like, there's areas I don't know out here.  I mean, it's only 7 by 13.  I'm like, Pete, I think we got to go back this way.  And then we started, like, driving into the hood.  And I'm like, no, this isn't there either.  You were lost going to your own house. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, wait, wait.  This is the hood, man.  I don't live close to this.  I'm like, I like these people, but I don't want to be killed over here.  You know what I mean?  So.  Yeah.  The cop sees you driving around those areas, thinks you're buying drugs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Especially me, because a friend of mine told me that one time, Anthony, he said, you know,  Mike, he said, you'll be safe in the hood.  He goes, you look like you're either the range cop or a member of the mafia.  Don't leave you alone.  Hmm.  Well, I don't know.  I think they'll still fuck you up.  But.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good luck to you. 
[01:48:00]  Keep up your good nature.  Then I get out of the hood, and I'm like, oh, wait, Pete, no, it's not this way.  Oh, yeah, I think it might be, because I haven't been over here in a while.  Oh, my God.  He said it was near a, you said that it was near a gas station.  Oh, yeah.  And, but there's a bunch of gas stations on Staten Island, so would you just look at every  gas station until you recognized one?  They have, like, 80 gas stations with, like, pittorias inside.  You know what I mean?  That's what they have over here.  Is that what goes on in Staten Island? 
[01:48:30]  Oh, God, yeah.  It's ridiculous.  But then we started getting close to the house.  I'm like, wait a minute, Pete, I think this is the, you know, and I'm like, no, damn it,  we're a few miles away from this.  Pete must have been like, fuck, I got to fucking go through this shit, but he's a kid.  Right, he can't say anything.  Yeah, he wants an in and a comedy thing.  Oh, yeah, he was thinking, you know, he said that he goes, who are your friends in this?  Oh, man.  You know, but he's a good kid, though. 
[01:49:00]  But I mean, but guys, it's been, it's been good.  I got up like three days in a row to call you guys.  I know.  Yeah, well.  Well, our studio was busted, so we apologize.  I felt so bad.  I'm like, this is horrible.  Because, you know, and I got up the first day and I'm like, okay, you know, and then  the next day I got up, I had like six hours sleep in the past three days, but I got up  and I went back to bed and I just like, it's worth every minute, I love you guys.  Wait, you stay up late every night?  No, I get home about two.  Yeah. 
[01:49:30]  And I, but I kept waking myself up because I don't want to oversleep.  Right.  So I drank a ton of water, kept running up, going to the bathroom.  Is that what you do to stay?  Yeah, yeah, to keep myself awake.  I'm like, I'm like drinking all kinds of water.  I'm like, oh God, I'm laying in bed, like twisting and turning going, Anthony's going  to punch me in the face if he grabs me if I'm late.  You know what I mean?  That's funny.  He's going to like put me in a headlock here.  That's what the Indians used to do.  I know.  I'm like, oh damn.  So they would get up early in the morning.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  That was their alarm clock. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Really?  They figured out how much water to drink right before bed and that would make you wake up  at the proper time.  But they were in shape then.  They were.  They all had abs and stuff.  There were no fat Indians.  You could wear a loincloth with pride.  That's right.  You weren't trying to hide your boobs.  No.  Indians didn't have boobs.  I can't hide my boobs, guys.  I've got to tie them down with a rope.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:50:30]  Right.  But we finally found my house.  Yeah.  Thank God for that.  And I was like, Pete, I'm so sorry, you know, but now you're going to have to put your  GPS on because I don't know how to get back to your house from here.  No, I'm sure at that point he wasn't worried about it anymore.  He was just glad he got rid of you.  No, it was different.  But he...  So he had GPS, but you didn't even know your address?  No, I was like, wait a minute.  No, this isn't it.  I'm like, oh, wait.  No, I could understand if you didn't know how to get from where you were to where you 
[01:51:00]  had to be because you were new in that area or something.  But to have GPS and you just didn't know the numbers and the word that make up an address,  that's kind of...  I know.  I called my mom up and she was like ticked off.  It was like late.  The show ran late.  I'm like, what's the new address again?  She goes, it's why you idiot.  That's only the beginning because when we first moved here, I locked myself out of my 
[01:51:30]  room by mistake.  How did that happen?  There was a key and I'm like, and all of a sudden they come home, right?  Yeah.  Now, my mom's a very good person, but she's also super biting and sarcastic, which she  has to be, right?  So I'm coming home.  I see a look on her face and I go, what happened?  Did somebody die?  And she goes, it should only be that simple.  Oh, geez.  I go, what do you mean?  And she goes, and I'm looking at my door and she's jimmying it with a butter knife trying  to open it.  She has my brother trying to pull it down. 
[01:52:00]  You know what I mean?  It's like, we called my friend up in the middle of the night.  It's like a plumber that came.  I waited a few hours for him to jimmying my door open.  She was, oh God.  And that was one of the first things that happened.  Why'd she have to get in there if you weren't home?  No, because I was just locked out.  I couldn't get back in the room myself.  Oh.  And my sleep apnea machine was in there and everything.  Oh, well.  Well, you need that.  Oh, yes.  She's like, she goes, she was like freaking out.  She's like, you called me in the middle of the night.  Look what happened.  I'm like, but I just, I didn't realize I had the key. 
[01:52:30]  I always lose keys, guys.  Very easily.  I break keys and doors by mistake.  I lose them.  We get to one.  It sounds like it's exhausting to me.  It sounds like at any turn, something's going wrong.  Yes.  Just basic stuff about to go wrong.  Oh, I actually, you know, by mistake, like months ago at work, I wore two different, I  told you guys I wore two different colored shoes to work by mistake.  Right.  Because I couldn't dress in the dark.  I'm like, now I make sure I have at least the light on when I'm getting dressed. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, well, that's good.  See you wearing it.  I don't turn the light on when you get dressed.  Right.  So you don't walk out of the house with two different shoes.  Something good.  Didn't the shoes feel different on your feet?  No, they were, they're both, my feet are like 11 wide, so they both fit, but what, and  I was like, wait a minute, because I was, I was like in a rush.  But how, hold on, hold on.  How different were the shoes, though?  Were they like two brands of Nikes, two different colors, or were they too drastic?  A Florsheim dress shoe and a moccasin.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it was like a black.  Yeah.  And like, I'm sort of brownish. 
[01:53:30]  Dress shoes you go with, or Penny Wolfers, what do you wear?  Dress shoes, I, I need, I gotta get sneakers.  I love them, but my feet are too fat for sneakers now.  Uh-oh.  They don't make fat sneakers?  I like an 11 wide.  I went into, like, you gotta make fat sneakers.  How are the fat people supposed to lose weight if they don't make fat sneakers?  Ah, what a conundrum.  That's like a Seinfeld thing happening right there.  They don't want us to lose weight, because think about it, there's a nation of obesity,  and they didn't want, you know what I mean?  They like having McDonald's and be choking McDonald's. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, the conspiracy theory going on here.  Conspiracy.  Keep the fat people fat, right?  It's a false flag.  No, it is, Anthony, because it's like, what's better for him?  Get that fat pig fatter, or we'll put him in a hospital bed and, like, train his savings  or whatever, or just, like, let him eat healthy.  We'll be 107.  We don't need that.  Well, I think you could put the shitty food out there and the fat sneakers.  That's a very good point.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  We could work those 4,000 calories off of McDonald's.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  So, but you managed to get through work with two different shoes on, so.  Yeah.  I, but that's always been my story, because, like, I remember one of the first times my  friend was going to take me to meet his cousin on a date.  Oh.  In high school.  Guy Fieri's here.  And I was fat to begin with.  Oh.  And my belt broke.  I thought we said no to Guy Fieri.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Is it today?  Oh.  He's not booked for you guys.  Oh, that's why he gave me that dirty look. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  What?  Hold on, Mike.  Sorry, we have a little drama.  Oh, no.  He walked down the hall and gave me some weird gang signs.  He's doing an interview in the studio over there.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Uh-huh.  Was that the mad Cuban with him?  Cuban's here.  Oh, fuck.  We'll talk to him.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, you guys okay?  Should I talk to him?  No, no.  Should I see if we can get the Cuban on the show?  Yeah, we'll have the Cuban.  Do you really want me to see if we can get the Cuban?  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Book the Cuban.  All right.  Who's Guy Fieri's, like, right-hand man.  I saw they had food with them.  The Cuban's hilarious. 
[01:55:30]  Sorry, Mike.  Go ahead.  I really apologize.  There was a whole thing that just happened outside the studio.  It was weird.  Oh, God.  I hope you guys are okay.  Everything's good.  Yeah, we seem to be all right.  We're okay, Mike.  I hope you guys are okay.  I think I looked through my mafia phone book.  And he means it.  That's the weird part.  I know.  Oh, yeah.  See, that'd be hilarious if it was just a line by a comic.  Yeah, he's the real deal.  But he meant that.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're all right, Mike.  We think.  I'm serious.  I always watch my friends and family.  That's number one to me.  Thank you, brother.  So what were you saying before I rudely interrupted you?  Oh, I forgot. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, about going on a date.  So my belt broke.  Right.  And I had, like, acne, like Alfred E. Newman, all over my face when I was a kid in high school.  And I'm like, so we're walking to this girl's house.  And all of a sudden, my friend introduced me.  And I heard her go.  Walks in the next room.  And she goes.  You've got to be kidding me with this.  Oh, no.  You heard her say that?  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, what a fucking bitch.  Not good.  And then we went downstairs.  And she's like, she's like, you know, then she warmed up a little bit. 
[01:56:30]  And I'm like, she's like, you know, maybe this isn't a good idea.  And I'm like thinking, do you know what I love, though, guys, now?  This is such a long time ago.  I love it because I see all the women that would never date me who helped me on Facebook.  And they're slowly turning into train wrecks.  So it gives you solace.  Right, right.  With guys, they can look sophisticated when you get older.  Woman, there's no turning back.  Woman?  She just hits it.  They all hit the wall and you fucking laugh. 
[01:57:00]  It took years and years and years, but you're finally getting your comeuppance.  Yes, yes.  I love it, guys.  You know, I'm like...  Women aging are like this studio, I guess.  Uh-huh.  Right?  They just fall apart.  They fall apart.  They get crackly.  The pieces start deteriorating.  Right.  And then you got some guy in the corner snoring instead of making sure the studio works.  Oh, God.  You got to replay that audio.  Because it's great to have social media and see what some of these whores look like.  These whores.  Are you going to get a special whore for Christmas? 
[01:57:30]  For the baby Jesus?  No, you know, I got to be respectful on Christmas and just wait until New Year and, you know,  pop a bottle of champagne open with some skank after that.  Some skank.  Hey, when you went downstairs to talk to this girl, after you heard her say, oh, well,  you've got to be kidding me with this, why did you even talk to her?  I was just, you know, I was only a kid.  I was a little upset and I was like thinking, you know, I was going to curse her out, but  I'm like, it's my friend's cousin and I'm like, oh, God, man. 
[01:58:00]  And I just tried to, I've always tried to be a general woman, but sometimes, you know.  Did you acknowledge it?  Did you say, hey, I heard what you said?  No, I did.  I just overlooked.  I should have.  Oh, God.  I should have looked at what I had.  Kids are such faggots when they get, like, fucking nailed like that.  You should just turn around and go, really, bitch?  What's so fucking special about you?  Damn it, that would have worked.  Yeah, that on first sight, I'm a piece of shit.  Fuck you.  I feel like saying, you know, she was about 14 or so, I was going to say, listen, honey,  in a few years you'll be sucking dick under the hood. 
[01:58:30]  Wow, right there.  Or that.  Oh, that's a hell of a jump.  That's what rejection leads to, I see.  Oh, shit.  And you got me fired up here.  Yeah.  We like when you're fired up.  I know.  You know why?  Because, you know, I'll put it this way.  I like people who are cool.  Those are nice people.  I don't care what anybody is.  If somebody's a jackass, they're a jackass.  It don't matter.  Yeah, you could probably kill that girl now, and so much time has gone by, no one will know  it's you.  Oh, no, not only. 
[01:59:00]  Make that connection.  She was in a neighborhood that was like, you know, kind of like, you know, when there's  a lot of Joe Pesci types.  Right.  Oh, yeah, huh?  So I don't know.  But they're all gone.  Now, I'm going to probably write a book about different shit.  But she's probably like, I won't.  That would be curious.  I'm curious to wonder what she looks like now, because she was a cute girl then.  But nothing stays forever.  I know she could look like a woken fucking rose.  Who knows?  Right.  Even a rose will wilt eventually.  Even a rose will wilt and turn into fucking dog shit.  Okay.  Well. 
[01:59:30]  Hot dog shit.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  I like it in angry sometimes, guys.  Oh, God.  That's great.  I've been so picked up by jerk offs.  I love it.  Hold on a minute.  Someone wants to say hi to you.  Hold on a minute.  This is perfect.  I think I found someone for you.  Maybe a connection?  Hello.  Who's this?  A connection?  Hi, it's me.  It's Diana.  Lady Di.  She's got to give every iteration of her name.  Right.  Hello.  Lady Di.  No, no.  No, it's not everyone.  Mike Buschetti, you want to go out with Lady Di? 
[02:00:00]  How old is she?  How old do you, Di?  Every question has to be answered with a question.  It's always the question.  Keep track, people.  You'll have fun with this.  Yes.  Lady Di.  Yeah, how old are you?  I'm 51.  She's 51.  Okay.  Sounds good.  I'm a year old, but that's not bad.  Well, but you look a little better than she does.  She looks about 60, to be quite honest with you.  Well, she's, you know, been through the mill a little bit.  No, come on.  No, I don't.  You wanted to ask me about Nelson Mandela the other day, right? 
[02:00:30]  No.  Why the fuck would we want Lady Di's input on Nelson Mandela?  The people on Twitter.  The people on Twitter.  The people on Twitter.  So when the people on Twitter get her going on something, automatically it's us that, you know.  Why are you concerned about Nelson Mandela when you got Mike Buschetti on the line with you?  I know.  Nelson's gone.  You know, he's an old guy.  Well, he was.  Yeah.  The Mad Cuban Institute.  The Mad Cuban's here. 
[02:01:00]  Fuck yeah.  On the phone with Lady Di.  We just booked you for our show.  Yeah, we just booked you.  Sit down.  He was a very good man.  Who?  No, he was.  You can't take that away from that.  Well, you can.  He's dead.  She's still talking about Nelson Mandela.  Anthony, he was 95 years old.  Come on.  Well.  What did I say?  I don't know.  I have no idea what you're saying.  Jesus Christ.  I hope I get that wrong.  He was up there in eight.  All right.  Tell us a little bit about it.  Give us your reflections of Nelson Mandela, Lady Di.  He was the president of South Africa. 
[02:01:30]  Right?  Okay.  It's not a quiz.  Just tell me how you feel about him.  Well, you know, how do you want me to feel?  I mean, the man was 95 years old.  Why was he happy?  Why was he so great?  Yes.  Why was he so great?  Oh, God.  There's the question.  There's the question.  And Anthony, he was also a Yankee fan.  Yeah, I'm sure he followed all the games.  Sure.  That's why he died.  He was bummed about the Cano thing. 
[02:02:00]  I don't know about that.  There's no sense of humor.  Why is she listening to this show?  No.  Once.  She has no clue what is funny.  Once in New York City, when he was giving a speech, he said he was a Yankee fan.  Okay.  He was in the Yankee stadium.  Isn't that when you just do that?  Yes, you just do that.  Right.  You just do that.  He wasn't a Yankee fan.  Why was he great?  Tell me.  Why was he great? 
[02:02:30]  There's the question.  Yes.  He did a lot of things for South Africa.  Like what?  Give me some examples.  I've never heard of anything bad about him.  What?  What about the bombings?  What about when he was arrested for treasonous acts and bombings?  Yeah.  What do you know about that?  I don't remember anything about that.  Oh.  All right.  I don't remember.  Okay.  Well, that's good.  That's a good...  Why did you think he was in prison?  Right. 
[02:03:00]  You know what?  I don't know.  Seriously.  I don't know.  I was very young back then.  I have no idea why.  Yeah, but you don't have to be young back then to know history.  Yeah.  And you said you wanted to call up...  About Nelson Mandela.  So we thought you would do a little book report for yourself.  And you were saying he's so great, but you don't know why he's great.  Right.  Wait.  No, really.  I don't know.  I think I might have just broke my hand.  I was pounding or something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It fucking hurts a lot. 
[02:03:30]  He's a great president of South Africa.  Why was he a great president of South Africa?  I don't...  You know what?  To tell you the truth, that's it.  I really don't know.  Then how could you say...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You were the one who said you wanted to talk about Nelson Mandela.  So how could you say he's great if you don't even know what he did?  I don't know what he did, really, to tell you the truth.  All right.  How about one inspirational quote from Nelson Mandela?  When he died, everyone tweeted their favorite Nelson Mandela quote.  I didn't see the... 
[02:04:00]  Mine was, no one is born hating.  I kind of like that one.  Which one you got?  I like that one, too, because it's very true.  It's very true.  Right.  Well, I don't know about anything else.  Yeah, that's evident.  Mike, this girl is perfect for you, brother.  I got him confused with Norie.  They're all pink on the inside, Mike.  Just remember that.  Oh, God.  Hold on, hold on.  What?  Another thing, too.  You wanted to find out about my Christmas plans?  What? 
[02:04:30]  The Twitter people are driving her fucking crazy, and I love it.  And please, Twitter people, keep it up.  You know what, lady?  Sure.  Yeah, what are you doing for Christmas?  We're just having a little get-together.  Over here.  My roommate is going to cook, okay?  Uh-huh.  And everything is all set over here.  How would this be interesting for anyone?  Why would anyone want to know this?  You just described probably ten...  Wait, how many Catholics?  There are over a billion Catholics? 
[02:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  You probably just explained Christmas for a billion people.  Yes.  Well, yeah.  A little get-together here.  A little get-together.  And then the extra tidbit we got was that her roommate will be cooking.  Well, that's good.  Thank God.  That's good.  What is he going to be cooking, Lady Di?  He's talking about cooking a ham.  Talking about...  Oh, wow.  How about that?  Hey, Mike...  I'm going to cut off the bottom of your bicep.  That's called the tricep, I guess.  Mike Bichetti.  Oh, yeah.  You got any questions for Lady Di? 
[02:05:30]  Maybe there's a connection here.  You never know.  What connection?  Lady Di, do you like ham?  Who?  Yeah.  Oh, my dad, yeah.  Why?  No, I was just curious, because you're going to put a pineapple and cloves on it?  A what?  Say that one more time.  Some people put pineapples on him.  Yeah.  I guess he's going to do that, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I guess.  You know, because he's the one that's going to go get it, so... 
[02:06:00]  I guess he's going to do that, yeah.  I thought you were going to go shopping with him, really.  That's right.  Um, no.  No, I usually don't really go shopping with him.  She's too busy getting drunk in the morning, Mike.  She doesn't really...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It ain't that.  This is the nightmare they don't fucking show you on Match.com, by the way.  These are the nightmares.  No, no, no.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I had enough of it.  Bichette, you can beat the shit out of her.  Yeah.  We go to the grocery store.  Sometimes I'll steer them the walkway.  She doesn't even hear me say that, which is perfect. 
[02:06:30]  It's pretty expensive, and he doesn't like that.  All right.  What do you...  In the grocery store, what do you do?  Pull the cart?  See?  Get it?  You put all the food and fish.  You put all groceries and you don't use really fun for him.  But I haven't been shopping with him in over a year.  Fascinating.  No, he likes going by himself.  So...  I don't reload the car up.  Kids say shit.  Right.  So your holiday plans are...  I go by myself when I go shopping, too.  You what? 
[02:07:00]  I go by myself when I go shopping.  Wow, you're a big girl.  A very big girl.  Yes.  All right.  Well...  I go by myself shopping.  I hate it, really.  Yeah.  Lady Di, how many natty lights are you into right now?  What do you mean?  How many natty lights have you had?  It's not a what do you mean question.  Yeah.  Do you want to know the truth?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is my second one.  Your second natty eyes.  Hold on.  Mike Pichet, I've got to put you on hold, because we have to...  Hold on a minute. 
[02:07:30]  Quarter to 9 a.m.  Yes.  Colin Quinn, what's up?  Oh, Carl.  Oh, my gosh.  Hey, Carl.  Hey, Carl.  You called in the middle of a fucking train wreck.  We got Mike Pichetti, but he's on hold right now, and you're on the line with Lady Di.  Lady Di's second natty ice deep.  Right.  I heard that, yeah.  Yeah.  We're very thrilled.  It's Friday.  I know it's not a good thing, but yeah.  Well, Colin, I hope you were listening when Lady Di gave everyone her Christmas plans. 
[02:08:00]  What is it, Lady Di?  Wait, let me get it.  What's that?  Would you like to come over?  Oh, wow.  I'd love to.  You got an invite?  Lady Di must love all these guys fawning over her on the phone.  Just one more thing.  Marion and I wanted to say Merry Christmas to the both of you.  She told me that you might be off next week.  Who is this Marion, Brian, you talk about all the time? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, nobody's ever learned months ago.  I know.  Ever since the N-word incident.  She follows me now on Facebook, though.  Who?  Marion?  Marion.  Oh, good.  I follow you, too.  Yes.  All right.  We know.  I know.  It's all about you, isn't it?  Marion is kind of, it's kind of like she's become like Shirley, and you're like Penny Marshall  who goes on to direct.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Cindy Williams just dropped out, you know?  We are known as the retarded Laverne and Shirley. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, we know.  That's why Colin did that Laverne and Shirley reference.  What a coinkydink.  Wow.  She would call you, but she's working.  She comes up with the most I-don't-give-a-shit statements.  Which makes it beyond fascinating.  Oh, yes.  Because she interrupts real conversations.  Yes.  Yes, with her just inane ramblings.  Hold on.  What? 
[02:09:30]  What's the Christmas plan?  Yeah.  The Christmas plans?  We're just having a couple of friends over here.  My son's coming over.  Yeah.  I would assume he's coming over.  Are you going to put on a, are you going to watch any specials or anything on TV?  Great question.  Specials on television?  Yeah.  Oh, question.  Let me see.  Question.  Yeah.  Question on top of question.  Okay.  Yeah.  Probably.  What are some of your favorites?  Yeah.  Miracle on 34th Street.  I always loved that one ever since I was a kid. 
[02:10:00]  I like the modern one better with Dylan McDermott.  I don't like that one.  You like that one?  Yeah.  I don't like, no, no, no.  I like the older one.  Why don't you like the newer one?  I don't know.  You know.  Because it's horrendous.  Dylan McDermott.  They take this classic, but Colin likes the one with Dylan McDermott.  Elizabeth Shue.  Yeah, it's Elizabeth Shue.  What was that Tom Hanks animated one? 
[02:10:30]  The Polar Express.  Yeah.  Do you like the Polar Express?  Or is that, you know, does that hit home a little too much?  Oh, wow.  Or hit, you know, hit something.  I never saw that one.  Oh.  All right.  I mean, do you watch Frosty?  Santa Claus is Coming to Town?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I used to have those for my son years ago.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, wow.  You actually did something for him.  48 cents, yeah.  No, no, no.  I mean.  Boy, you were able to afford a three-pack.  Does Marion come over? 
[02:11:00]  No.  Good question.  Yeah.  Fine.  I don't know.  I have to ask her if she has any other plans, which she probably does.  I think she does.  Her calendar is probably full of the holiday season.  That dance card.  She's a great in corner of Elizabeth, New Jersey.  She's got like 12 holiday parties.  No, it's really kind of early to tell.  Kind of early to tell.  I'll talk to her later.  Yeah, it's real early to tell.  That's for sure.  She can't wait. 
[02:11:30]  I don't know.  I'm going to talk to her.  Can't wait to look down and see that caller ID coming across the old fucking iPhone.  Oh, man.  It starts with do not answer.  Oh, we just got more info.  She just called a little while ago.  Oh, good.  That's good.  You really added a lot there.  That is good.  I think she has plans with her family, too.  Huh?  I think she has plans with her family, too.  And Lady Di, what about the big New Year's Eve party?  What are you going to be doing?  That, I don't know about. 
[02:12:00]  What?  You got a plan early or you're going to be shut out?  Miley Cyrus is going to be doing the ball drop, you know?  Oh, is she?  Like a wrecking ball thing?  Well, I guess.  I'm sure she'll make some kind of reference to that.  I'm sure she will.  I'm sure she will.  Boy, if she doesn't, Seacrest will.  You know that?  Of course he will.  Oh, yeah, well, he's clever, that Seacrest.  He's the best.  Right.  He's the best.  He's going to flinch from that kind of stuff.  He'll be like, you know, don't touch there, you know, and climb this one or whatever.  Yeah, he's the best at all that, isn't he? 
[02:12:30]  Oh, my God.  So, Lady Di, no New Year's Eve plans.  What did you do last year for New Year's Eve?  That's a good way to gauge what you can.  That's the way I slipped right through it.  What?  Of course you slept right through it.  You slept.  No, it's called passed out.  Yeah, you passed out through it.  Passed out through it.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  I mean, you know, I mean, New Year's is not a big deal to me.  Now, if somebody wants to take me out.  Whoa.  Colin, I heard that loud and clear. 
[02:13:00]  Loud and clear.  I know a few people here that want to take her out.  Are you suggesting Colin to ask you out for New Year's?  Yeah.  It would be nice.  It would be nice, right?  Paul, you know, she's not quite playing hard to get over here.  She's a big guy.  I like it.  I like it.  Yes, yes.  I don't go for that coy stuff.  I like it.  No, the straightforward approach.  Right.  Dirty Diana.  Lady Diana.  You know, like Dirty Diana.  Yes, Dirty Diana. 
[02:13:30]  Lady Diana.  Yeah.  Lady Di, would you, you know, do a little.  Would you do a little something with Colin Quinn if he takes you out to New Year's?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  It depends on Colin.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Wow.  Wow.  A little reciprocation for some big plans.  I'm sure Carl has something big going on on New Year's Eve.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  I don't know.  He's going to have to direct message me or something or whatever. 
[02:14:00]  That's the way.  She does not play this game.  It's like a dance, isn't it, Carl?  This whole man-woman thing.  It really is a delicate dance of love.  Yes, isn't it?  She knows how to play.  I will even stay sober until 11.30. 
[02:14:30]  Well, you know, that's a big deal.  You've got to pregame.  That's how you know she doesn't have a problem.  Right.  Yeah, you've got to pregame a little, Lady Di.  It'll loosen up a little bit.  Just a little bit.  Maybe a couple of shots.  Yeah.  Some Jaeger.  I don't.  I don't.  Some Natty King Cole.  Natty King Cole, yeah.  Natty King Cole?  Oh, that's what she just repeats herself again.  Well, Lady Di, it sounds terrific. 
[02:15:00]  Have you gotten all your shopping done, Lady Di?  Oh, Christmas shopping.  Actually, everybody.  You see, I can't give that away.  What?  Everybody's getting Christmas cards with a little bit of money in it.  A little scratch.  Crazy fuck.  A little money in it.  A little scratch.  I think I'm going to need more than Elizabeth, probably.  How much money are you putting in the cards?  Yeah.  None of that.  No, I'm not going to say that.  How much about it?  Give us ballpark.  $1,000. 
[02:15:30]  No, you're not.  A lying sack of shit.  No, no, no.  No, how much about it?  Oh, let me see.  Yeah.  Should I say something or not?  No, I can't tell you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Say something.  Di, just say it.  Let's get it over with.  You're going to say it eventually, so just save us time.  Right.  How much?  Everybody's in $25.  $25.  $25.  $25.  $25 smackaroos.  Nice.  That's pretty good.  From the Lady Di fortune. 
[02:16:00]  From her dad's money.  She doesn't have no fortune.  She doesn't always give it up.  Yeah.  She does.  She'll always give it up.  I think you fell under questioning.  It's no big deal.  Huh?  It's no big deal.  It's no big deal.  $25.  How many people?  Certainly isn't it.  How many people are on your list?  Well, actually, I only got four people on my list.  That's a cool hundy.  A cool hundy.  Drop a banjo.  I can't just go around money just like that. 
[02:16:30]  I'm not, you know, I don't have that much to go around.  Hey, you're not made of money.  Right.  You also haven't had a job in a long time.  Yeah, and you haven't worked.  Hey, Lady Di, have you tried to get a job lately?  Yes, I have.  Where'd you go?  Breaking news.  I went all over the town of Elizabeth.  And you know what?  Let me tell you something right now.  I might go beyond the town of Elizabeth.  Wow.  She's threatening other New Jersey town.  Branching out.  Right.  How'd the Burger King gig go?  How'd the Burger King gig go? 
[02:17:00]  You know what?  I have no idea.  I would really love for them to call me.  They're calling me.  You apply to Burger King.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  How long ago was that?  I would say right now about maybe about a month ago.  And you just had fingers crossed for the old callback, huh?  Yeah.  That's that go-to-it attitude.  Lady Di, our organization could really use a go-getter like you.  Well, you know what?  You know what?  We only have the one truck. 
[02:17:30]  Okay?  And Bill does need the truck every once in a while.  We only have one vehicle.  Yeah.  All right?  So I don't want to go too far.  Isn't there public transportation?  Right.  That would explain why you haven't worked in six years.  Public transportation?  From where I lived to Burger King, that's only two blocks down.  You don't need no public transportation.  All right.  Well, you can walk the two blocks.  But you don't have that job.  Right.  You got to get a job.  You have to dig the bus.  I know what I got to get. 
[02:18:00]  Lady Di, where else did you apply?  Well, I tried Family Dollar.  That fucking Family Dollar again?  Enough with Family Dollar.  They don't want you.  I don't have a problem applying online with that.  Of course, like you did for the past year.  Year.  You've been talking about that goddamn Family Dollar for years.  I tried at the Dunkin' Donuts.  Oh, and the Dunkin' Donuts.  All right. 
[02:18:30]  They don't want you.  What do you mean they don't want me?  They haven't called.  Holy shit.  They don't, Lady Di.  They don't want you.  Lady Di, you got to read this play.  The Iceman Comment by Eugene O'Neill.  I got a guy that sits there, he drinks in the bar,  and he always says, I'm going out for a walk.  And he never goes out for a walk.  I'll give you a big pickup call.  I love it.  Oh, really?  I did try a few other places.  What other places?  Yeah, what other places?  Tell us.  Half-Walk.  There's an application in there. 
[02:19:00]  They haven't called me.  This was like two weeks ago I applied for this one.  All right.  Okay.  It's still early.  And let me see.  Not exactly Shop.  No, I can't.  No, not ShopRite.  Oh, well.  What, you got something against them?  Pathmark, yes, but not those bastards over at ShopRite.  Right.  Wow.  They're in the Whole Foods.  Yeah.  And I try those local supermarkets around here.  Ah, supermarkets.  All right.  Yeah.  Try to be a cashier, I see. 
[02:19:30]  Going for the cashier job?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Imagine getting in her line.  What a pain in the ass that would be.  Oh, it's lettuce.  My roommate bought some lettuce the other day.  He's going to make a salad.  That's fantastic.  There's 100 people online waiting to pay.  Oh, God.  Just this babbling idiot.  Slow motion.  Talk about the fucking avocado.  Oh, don't they're really good this time of year?  You know, my roommate made a guacamole last night.  That was wonderful.  We all got together.  I like to use it as a dip with certain things. 
[02:20:00]  And you're just like, fucking ring me up.  Yeah.  Colin, you missed Lady Di's thoughts on Nelson Mandela.  She surprised us all.  Oh, yeah.  She gave him a great tribute earlier.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  It was a tragedy.  Let's face it, Lady Di.  95 years old, right?  Di?  Say that one more time again.  I'm sorry.  I'm saying it's a tragedy.  What?  It was a tragedy.  Right?  He was a drunkie? 
[02:20:30]  No, that's you.  And I have a nutty ice.  Are you deaf?  No one was born with a nutty ice.  Nutty ice.  Yes.  Nobody was born with a beer can.  Was it a nice tribute?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  It was terrific.  She had a lot to say.  But she says he's a great man and was a great president.  But she can't name one thing that he's ever done. 
[02:21:00]  And she said she doesn't know why he was in prison for all that time because she was very young then.  Right.  I was very young back then.  Yes, I was.  So.  I have no idea why he was in prison.  I know.  I didn't hear his name until about 1987 myself.  Yes.  For 1987.  When this movie, when the Mandela movie comes out on, what do you call it, you know, when it comes out on, yeah, when it comes out on Netflix or whatever that is, then I'll. 
[02:21:30]  It's Netflix.  Yeah, whatever.  And then you'll learn about it from a movie.  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's how a lot of us get our knowledge.  But in the meantime.  I was young.  But in the meantime, you're going to just go online and everywhere and talk about what a great man he was, not knowing anything about him.  Right.  He could have been a horrible person.  You don't know.  I have no idea about him, but I never heard anything. 
[02:22:00]  Let's put it this way.  Out of all the times I watched the news, I never heard anything bad about him.  This is America right here.  I know.  Lady Di is a miracle.  She is every voter.  Wow.  I've never heard of Benworth.  Well, okay.  That's fantastic, Lady Di.  Hey, I never heard anything bad about him.  Sounds like a nice enough guy.  I don't know.  I mean, I just never really heard anything bad about him.  Plus, he was 95 years old. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, he's got to be okay, then.  So was like Joseph Mengele.  Mm-hmm.  I think he was an old guy, too.  We really got a break.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, my God.  Hello, guys.  Yeah.  That was fantastic.  Carl, including me.  It was a lovely afternoon.  I love it.  When you die, I'll see you or not see you on New Year's Eve.  Maybe it'll be one of those, like, what was that?  Oh, Sleevelson, Seattle.  Did they meet, like, New Year's?  Yeah, New Year's Eve on top of the Empire State Building.  God, you've got to go.  How about that?  She could crawl up the outside.  You've got to go over to her house for Christmas dinner, man.  Oh, my God. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, that would be great.  Oh, my God.  You won't invite me, Colin.  Yeah, he knows he's invited.  She did invite you.  He's got to figure it out.  There's an envelope there for me, too.  No taking that back.  As long as there is an envelope for her.  Yeah.  Who the hell is this?  What is this?  That's the broad from the talk, right?  Who?  What?  It's Colin anyway.  I think that's the broad from the talk.  This little blonde over there.  A lot of juice walking by our studio right now.  Yeah.  Hey, you know their religion. 
[02:23:30]  Happy holidays to all of you in the studio.  All right.  Thank you, Lady Paul.  All right.  The same to you and, of course, Marion.  Yes.  Yes.  The other half.  I'll let her know.  Do you still talk to Marion?  Yeah, I still talk to Marion.  I talk to her every day.  I can't.  Colin just left.  Yeah, he's had enough.  I don't blame him.  He had enough.  He doesn't want to OD on this.  I hope.  I was trying to get a Colin Quinn plug-in.  I don't know where he's going to be this weekend.  Mike Bichetti.  Sorry about that. 
[02:24:00]  That's okay.  When I first heard of Mandela, I thought Noriega died.  I got them confused.  Oh, well.  Noriega's been dead for a while, isn't he?  Really?  I didn't know.  I have no idea.  I think he was.  I thought he was.  I don't know.  I'm not good at current events, really.  Yeah.  Well, even Lady died.  You two are a match made in heaven.  It's too bad Lady died looks like shit, or this would be a really good thing for you,  Mike Bichetti.  You don't mind, Mike.  You don't want to be like that girl that went, that fucking said that about you when 
[02:24:30]  you were growing up.  Right.  No, no, no.  You don't want to see Lady dying and go, oh, fuck, that sucks.  You know, then you'd just be doing what that fucking bitch did.  Oh, no.  No, you're right.  Because you'd just come back to hit me in the butt.  Yeah.  So, you know, maybe you two.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What?  How do you spell his last name?  Mike Bichetti?  What is that?  What are you doing?  Taking notes?  No, no, no.  What I'm going to do, I'm going to pull up a picture of him, because I never saw him.  Oh, okay.  This could be fun. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  All right.  Nice.  Are you by your computer right now, Lady Di?  My phone is my computer.  Hey.  All right.  Are you ready to type?  No, no, no, no, no.  How do you spell his last name?  B-O-C-C-H-E-T-T-I.  Mike B-O-C-C-H?  Yes.  Okay.  E.  The Shetty?  T-T-I.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  B-O-C-C-H-E-T-I-T-I-T-I-T-I-T-I-T-I. 
[02:25:30]  Bichetti.  How does D work into Bichetti?  I...  I...  What do you got so far?  Yeah.  D-O-C-C-H.  E-T-T-I.  E-T-T-I.  Okay.  And when I have a chance, I'll pull up a picture of him.  No, we want to do it.  No chance, bro.  I'm putting him back door now.  Back door now.  What?  You can't use your phone and look things up at the same time? 
[02:26:00]  I can, but I don't want to do that.  Why?  What?  Are you religious?  I don't want to guess, but this is my picture, maybe.  Put it on speaker.  Why don't you want to do that now?  Put it on speaker and look it up.  Huh?  I don't want to do that.  Why?  At least I know what Colin Quinn looks like.  This has to do with anything.  Colin gave up on us a while ago.  Hell.  I don't blame him.  She didn't write down the name.  She doesn't know how his name spelled.  No, I know.  Yes, I did.  I wrote it down.  All right.  How do you spell it?  B-O-C-C-H-E-T-T-I. 
[02:26:30]  All right.  Right again.  All right.  She's good.  That didn't take that.  I'm going to look it up later on.  Oh, God.  Oh, thanks.  I like being tossed in the furnace.  Yeah, yeah.  She's going to judge you.  So what are you, judging him?  Oh, no.  A woman, oh, yeah.  They're very, like, anybody.  No, women are very planistic.  Yeah.  Planistic indeed.  Where are you thinking you two go out to some gin mill or something?  Oh, I haven't drank in years.  Yeah.  He doesn't drink, Di.  What do you think?  Yeah. 
[02:27:00]  That's okay.  Why?  How is that okay?  Right.  You're a lush.  I don't know.  It just means more for her.  Oh, that's true.  No, it doesn't mean more for me.  Oh, sorry.  I really meant that way.  Oh, that's not more.  But, Mike, you've got to deal with a girl that, like, wants to drink all the time.  That's kind of a pain.  Are you a good drunk?  She's not a good person.  Not a good anything.  Yeah.  Are you a good drunk, Lady Di?  No, no, no.  I usually eat. 
[02:27:30]  What are you talking about?  What the fuck?  If I just slept, I would be drunk.  What the fuck?  No, I'm trying to...  Yeah, no shit.  I said, are you a good drunk?  Am I a good drunk?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Question with a question.  No one was ever questioning the fact that you eat, Lady Di.  All right.  No, no, no.  I'm all right.  Yeah.  I'm good.  I worry when people say they're right when they're drunk.  I bet she gets belligerent.  Sure.  No, I don't.  No, I don't get belligerent. 
[02:28:00]  Do you get...  How do you get...  Do you get fun?  Happy.  Happy.  Happy.  Oh, good enough.  Punch and fight at Walmart.  All right.  We should go.  All right.  We'll take a break then.  Yeah, we got to take a break, everyone.  Okay.  Okay.  Happy holidays.  Thank you.  Yes.  Happy holidays.  Thank you, Buschetti.  We're going to probably try to get you in here next week because we're really going  to fool around next week.  Oh, yeah.  It's the last week of radio for the year and we're going to just fucking goof off. 
[02:28:30]  Last big fiesta of the year.  All right.  It'll be fun, man.  I love you guys.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  Lady Di, you want to come in?  Do I want to come in next week?  Oh, my God.  The question.  Let's see what happens.  I don't know.  Let's play it by ear.  Right.  Let's just, you know, see what happens.  Why?  What do you have planned, Lady Di?  I wish I could just live my whole life playing it by ear like her.  Play it by ear.  Yeah.  The monkeys might be on TV.  Right.  You never know.  The monkeys are on TV only one hour on a show.  It was a joke. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, God.  Thank God she put the schedule out.  Let me know when the monkeys are on.  She answers jokes.  She answers jokes.  She answers puns.  She answers sarcasm.  She just.  But she'll tell everyone she's a huge fan of the show.  Oh, yeah.  She's a huge fan of the show.  I know.  We don't know why, though.  Lady Di.  Why are you.  I always love you guys.  Come on.  Why are you a huge fan of the show? 
[02:29:30]  I loved you guys from the very beginning.  Come on.  Why?  Why?  The question is why.  Because you guys are funny.  Oh, I am.  It doesn't seem like you really know what funny is.  When you were.  No.  When you were on.  I have nothing against XM.  I just don't have it.  All right.  Yeah.  But when you were.  When you were on WDW.  And I used to drive home in the morning.  In the morning.  In the afternoon.  Yeah.  Okay.  I used to listen to you guys all the time.  Oh, well, you're weaving all over the road.  Playing.  Being hammered. 
[02:30:00]  Right.  Stop weaving all over the road.  All right.  All right.  Answer the question.  Answer the joke.  Whatever.  Answer everything.  Holy shit.  Stop answering everything.  Stop answering everything.  Right.  Lady Di.  What?  You used to.  You used to drive home from the beer place a little tipsy, right?  No.  A little.  A little.  A little bit, right?  But you used to have a couple of beers during the work day.  No.  All right.  Lady Di.  To be fair.  When was the last time that you did drive a little and a little tipsy? 
[02:30:30]  The last time I drove the truck?  Yeah.  Yeah.  With a little, a couple of beers in you.  Just a couple of beers.  I didn't have any beer on me, but I, but I drove it yesterday.  A little drunk?  No.  But what time, what time did you drive the truck yesterday?  I don't know.  Around 10 in the morning?  Well, you drink every morning before nine.  So you had a couple of beers.  No, I did not.  Yes, you did.  You had a couple of beers yesterday morning. 
[02:31:00]  I don't drink and drive.  I don't do things like that.  But you had a couple of beers yesterday morning.  No.  Or did you?  No.  I tried to call the show up yesterday.  What happened to your phone?  And then if we would have answered and asked you what you were drinking, you would have said Natty Ice.  Yeah.  See?  Sure.  See?  But you said you didn't drink yesterday.  But, but, well, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  I knew I was going to drive, so I was not drinking.  All right? 
[02:31:30]  After I stopped calling, I just waited until around 10 o'clock, and then I went out.  But you had some drinks before that.  I did not.  No, I didn't.  You're lying.  That's not true.  All right.  How much does it take you to get a tanked?  Yeah.  How many beers before you're drunk, Lady Di?  Me?  Yeah.  No.  The other person we're talking to with the name Lady Di.  That drinks.  Samus.  I don't know.  Maybe about 12.  12 beers and you're...  You know the truth? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  It's a guest of it.  12 beers.  It's 12.  12 beers.  You know, 10 beers just takes the edge off.  Oh, my gosh.  12 beers to get drunk.  She says you want to know the truth.  You're a fucking rhinoceros.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  She needs two six-packs.  You can hit her with a tranquilizer and it doesn't fucking have an effect on her.  That lady Di.  It takes a lot for me to get drunk.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's called tolerance.  Yep.  It happens with alcoholics.  Yep. 
[02:32:30]  Speaking of tolerance, we have none for you.  None.  None.  Oh, God.  All right.  We got to go.  We got Dan Soder.  Like I said, have a great week.  Yeah, Mike, we'll try to book you for next week if you're around, all right?  Yeah, definitely around, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  And thank you for everything today.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  You guys are going to be around next week?  Didn't we ask her in?  Yeah.  We did it a couple times.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to keep that in mind.  Okay.  For what?  I'm just saying.  I'm going to keep that in mind.  For what?  For what?  For what? 
[02:33:00]  What?  I thought you guys were going on vacation.  You don't even have satellite radio.  I know I don't have satellite radio.  What are you keeping it in mind for?  What are you keeping it in mind for?  Great question.  Marion has the satellite radio.  I don't have it.  Why are you keeping it in mind?  This has to stop.  Because Marion will keep me updated about what's going on with you guys.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  It's a dumb radio show.  Go fucking breathe somewhere.  It's a dumb person. 
[02:33:30]  What?  No, not only that, but I also keep in touch with you on the computer also.  Oh, that's good.  She doesn't answer.  She had no answer for why she was going to keep that in mind.  Why are you keeping it in mind?  We invited you in.  I know you invited me in.  You're coming in.  You got nothing going on.  So if you knew we were inviting in, then why would you say, are you guys on next week?  Guys, guys, guys.  I usually like coming in with Marion. 
[02:34:00]  Come on.  And you know she works.  Just shut up.  Okay.  I'll tell you the truth.  Marion is holding you back anyway, so just come in here without her.  She's not holding me back.  She's not holding me back.  I like to come in with her.  You can come in here and discharge on your own.  Right.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on a second.  That was nothing.  That discharge was nothing.  It was a clear discharge. 
[02:34:30]  A clear discharge.  For the people that don't know, yeah, she had a clear discharge last time she was in.  You came.  She came in her pants last time she was in the studio.  Right.  Oh, God.  I came in and I had to go to the bathroom and yeah.  There was a little bit of cum in the panties.  Yeah.  Mike, you might have to deal with some clear discharge.  Oh, no.  She squirted while Kenny was talking to her.  Yeah.  We don't know what it was.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  What did Colin do?  Get off the phone?  Yeah.  He bailed on this a long time ago.  I don't blame him.  We probably should have, too.  All right.  Lady Di, thank you.  Happy holidays.  And you, too.  And maybe I'll call you next week, okay?  Maybe.  Maybe.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Have a happy holiday.  All right.  Mike Buschetti.  What's your Twitter, Mike?  Oh, it's Mike Buschetti at Twitter.  All right.  So, Mike, B-O-C-C-H-E-T-T-I.  Oh, yeah.  Bye, Mike Buschetti.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Okay, cool.  All right, guys. 
[02:35:30]  Have a great day.  Bye.  All right.  Take care.  Also, the key...  Oh, my God.  What were you going to say?  What?  It wasn't for you.  It wasn't for fucking you.  We said bye already.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  I'll talk to you next week, okay?  Have a nice weekend.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, shit.  She is...  I don't even know if that's good radio.  Oh, I love it.  I have no idea.  I love it.  I could talk to her for four straight hours. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  She is so annoying.  It's so fucking annoying to listen to her.  But it's not...  Throw every question back at us.  Yeah.  It's not annoying if you understand all her tells, where she answers every question with  a question before she answers the question.  And then she answers jokes, puns, and anything humorous.  Yeah.  As if it's serious.  As if it was a serious question presented to her.  Right, right.  Also, she lies constantly.  Yes.  Oh, Lady Di, it's like you're from the moon or something. 
[02:36:30]  I'm not from the moon.  I'm not from the moon.  Oh, okay.  All right, cool.  All right.  Because we were speculating whether you were from the moon.  Our assumption was that you lived on the moon.  Write this down.  We got our next bit with her.  Next time, it's all questions like that.  Just like outrageous fucking things.  The more outrageous, the better.  Just to hear her go, no, I'm not from the moon.  That's like when Lady Di was a fucking phantom pilot in Vietnam. 
[02:37:00]  I was never a phantom pilot in Vietnam.  Right, right.  No, no.  No, no.  I wasn't a phantom pilot in Vietnam.  Let's roll with that next time.  You'll remember?  Yeah.  Okay.  That will be the bit.  Yeah, because she's fucking insane.  Yes.  Got the Mad Cuban in studio.  We booked him instead of Guy Fieri.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's what the fuck is.  Yeah.  Oh, you had no idea?  What the fuck am I doing here?  We bailed on Guy, but we saw that you were with him, so we booked you.  A last minute booking.  He's been in here for 40 minutes. 
[02:37:30]  I'm going to get fired.  The whole time.  Oh, shit.  Guy's people have been calling him.  Right.  Going like, where the fuck are you?  He just keeps turning his phone off.  Oh, man.  And then we got Dan Soder, who's been patiently waiting outside.  Yeah.  So we're going to take a break, and then we're going to continue to stay there.  The Cuban's sticking around.  Yes, he is.  Come on.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is for Dan Soder, who's in studio now.  Oh, it's too sweet. 
[02:38:00]  You guys are too sweet to me.  You treat me too good.  You're a big fan.  Huge fan.  Of Queen of the Stone Age.  They're playing this weekend?  Barclays Center tomorrow night.  Really?  I'm very excited.  I might have an extra ticket.  Really?  I just have.  You got my number?  I got your number.  I wouldn't mind seeing these guys.  Yeah, and the seats are pretty fucking good, too.  What am I doing tomorrow?  I might be clear tomorrow.  Yeah, I'll let you know.  I'm finding out.  I should find out in three hours.  I got a guy over there.  You do?  Yeah, we can go way down.  Yeah.  Where's your seats? 
[02:38:30]  Pretty good.  I'm like in the first five rows of the seats.  Middle of the...  We can go down.  Yeah.  We can be feet from the stage.  Done.  Roll in.  I'll leave my girlfriend...  Row, row.  I'll leave my girlfriend with my friends.  I trust him enough.  No diddling while I'm watching Queens.  Nice.  And we also have the Mad Cuban here.  We booked him over Guy Fieri.  This is funny.  And he's really freaked out.  I'm so...  This is bullshit.  I met the Mad Cuban during one of Roland's foodie shows. 
[02:39:00]  And he's great.  We love him.  And we like Guy.  Yeah, but there's no reason for me to be here right now.  Why?  I can think of one reason.  Because I'm here working for Guy and you got me in the studio.  I'm going to get fired.  We said no to Guy for today.  I'm definitely fired from everybody.  But then we saw you walking with him.  I put yes to the Mad Cuban.  I didn't know he was available today.  You didn't see me carrying bags of food?  Yeah, I saw that.  That was nice.  Oh, man.  Bullshit.  This is bullshit.  It's so great.  And you know what's great?  The lobby is not accessible right now. 
[02:39:30]  You can't go in the lobby.  Dude, I thought...  So you have to walk by our studio on the way out.  So Guy is definitely going to see the fact that the Cuban's in here having the time of his life.  Are you going to be screamed at, Cuban?  But do you know why...  I can scream that when I'm doing a good job.  You know why the lobby's not available?  Why?  I thought the stonework was done.  No.  All that is now going to go be stone.  The whole lobby.  I told you the whole lobby is stone.  The whole lobby.  I thought it was just near the elevators.  That's why they said farewell to the ping pong table last night.  Really?  Because the ping pong table doesn't fit with the stone lobby. 
[02:40:00]  The motif.  And I guess, unlike us, everyone's off next week?  I mean, a lot of people are.  They're pretty much shutting this place down so they can get all that work done, right?  Yeah.  What do you mean stone?  What's it going to...  Well, you see, Dan, instead of like...  Please, go to the floor with me.  I better not.  Let's...  We're in a good place.  The priorities are a little weird around here.  Okay.  Well, stone is elegant.  It is.  It's a very elegant form.  Let the Opie and Anthony studio fall apart as long as we have our stone laid nicely in the lobby. 
[02:40:30]  We had a victory tonight.  We did have a victory.  Tim's looking at it as a victory that we're back on the air today.  Yeah, I would love to help you out with the last half hour of the show, but now I'm completely  preoccupied with the fact that Tim wants to see me after the show.  He came in here, he shakes my hand, and talks to everybody, and then he walks out and tells  Kenny that he wants to see me after the show.  Why the fuck didn't he just say something? 
[02:41:00]  Go see him now.  Maybe it's Guy talking to him to get to Cuba.  I don't give a shit.  Let's just keep scaring the Cuban as much as possible.  I'm a ghost already.  I just want to go on record, I have nothing to do with it.  Because you gave me a little look.  I'm like, I have nothing to do with this.  No, not that you had something to do with it.  I have nothing to do with it.  Not that you had anything to do with it.  I was just like, what the fuck?  It was weird how it went down.  You should go now.  I would love to find out what it's all about.  Yeah, okay, I will.  All right.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  I'm not going to sit here. 
[02:41:30]  I'm not going to sit here wondering what the fuck someone wants when I'm supposed to  be entertaining people.  Yeah, that was bad timing on Tim Sabian's part.  Yes, very bad timing.  I'm good.  And I agree with you, Anthony.  Yeah, you shouldn't have to do that.  You see the pig, Cano, got pregnant?  Oh, my God.  What was that?  Is that some side action?  Cover of the Daily News.  I think it might have been before he had money.  I mean, the kid's three.  How long has Cano been in the league?  He's had some bucks. 
[02:42:00]  He's had some money for a while.  Yeah, he just signs that ridiculous deal with Seattle.  Cover of the Daily News, apparently, he doesn't pay his child support.  He's, yeah, he just made $240 million, and how much?  Ah, $600 bucks.  He can't even come up with the $600.  What a piece of shit.  Is that really it?  My dad was a bartender at a bowling alley, and he still floated fucking $500 a month.  How ugly is the kid?  The kid's kind of cute.  Then what the fuck?  The baby's mama's a beast. 
[02:42:30]  He's a monster.  I can understand if it's an ugly kid, you don't give as much, but...  It's almost like it's impressive that he had a baby with her.  Wow.  That he got to completion.  Hold on.  Cano gets $148,000 a game.  They figure out how much he's going to get a game.  That's $148,000 every time he fucking plays a game.  Just to go play a nice...  Actually, even the games he doesn't play.  Yeah.  That's how they figure that out.  So even on his...  You know, when they take that day off shit, he'll make $148,000 a game, but pays baby 
[02:43:00]  mama only $600 a month sometimes.  I'm not lying when I'd say I'd rather fuck the nanny in the Schwarzenegger case.  Oh, that's...  Wow.  Wow.  The maid.  Where's the picture this broad?  It's on page four of the Daily News.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Wow.  You get a nice side profile of her.  Wow.  He went pigging.  Yeah.  But I don't know, man.  It's like I always noticed athletes just have this weird taste.  They don't like...  That's rough, man.  Like, if you and I were to be like, oh, who would you bang if you were a famous athlete? 
[02:43:30]  Right.  We would have good-looking women.  Yeah, she wouldn't be on my list.  No, but maybe that's what does it for them.  Wow, man.  Maybe he gets hired to hot chicks and it's like, I never fuck pigs.  It's like the Mick Jagger.  Like, he got so sick of women that he banged David Bowie.  Is that right?  Yeah, well, that's like the rumor.  And maybe that's what happens.  And the kid is cute.  Kid's adorable.  Why can't he come up with the $600 a month?  I don't know.  Maybe he hopes that kid's got to learn how to throw a curveball.  That's not...  That's what he's doing for. 
[02:44:00]  That's not cool, man.  He's making sure his kid gets a fucking contract.  Right.  Wow, that's not cool.  That's true.  It's just funny that he's got so much money.  I would love to hear his side of the story.  I don't want to pay.  Right.  She's gross.  She's gross.  That's all he says.  Robinson Cano, for a comment, said, no way, she's gross.  Oh, hell no.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not like some Sean Kemp shit, but it's just as funny.  Did you see Dominican Republic in homes of Castro and Cano? 
[02:44:30]  What?  Homes of...  Oh, so that's the home she lives in.  Is that what they're trying to say?  Oh.  Okay.  No, he's got two homes.  Yeah, okay.  You better have two homes with that kind of money.  Yeah, you better.  Yeah, plus, you know, I'm guessing the housing market in the Dominican Republic is probably  pretty cheap.  Yeah, actually, 600's not bad in DR.  Yeah.  She's doing good.  Yeah, 600, that's a king's ransom in the DR.  She's making enough money to be fat.  Yeah.  She ain't starving.  You know?  If you're fat, you ain't broke. 
[02:45:00]  There you go.  See, that's why we had the Mad Cuban on the show.  That's right.  Guy Fieri wouldn't have come up with that.  Fuck, no.  Well, no, I wouldn't have.  Seriously, this is my goodbye party.  Why?  Everything that makes money from me.  I can't tell you.  I hope you guys enjoy it.  How funny it is, what you guys did.  What?  I think it's incredible.  Calling the Cuban in.  Yeah.  That's awful.  We called him the left-hander, you know?  Yeah.  You guys got thrown screwballs.  We called him in.  Yeah.  Well, Guy Fieri gave me some weird fuck you fucking gang language.  He was saying hello.  That's how he says hello? 
[02:45:30]  Oh, man.  This is bad.  This is bad.  Negative room in here.  We normally assume that there's positive things happening to us outside of it.  He was like a whole other person.  What do you know about the hairdresser thing?  Get the fuck out of here.  He's not going to give you that shit.  What are you, nuts?  Do you see it?  I have a family.  Do you see it?  You saw the same video we did, though, right?  You saw the video, right?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  This is a smart man.  This is a man that's saving his paycheck. 
[02:46:00]  I'm going to take pictures of my kids.  He's going to be in the daily news.  It's going to be a story about him not getting any money.  Like Cano's wife with $600 a month?  Get the fuck out of here.  He's looking at Opie like, why the fuck would you ask me that question?  You guys are close.  I'll show you my asshole before I talk about that shit.  Smart man.  That's a man that's keeping his paycheck coming.  But are you thinking what we're thinking?  Fuck that shit.  You're a fucking asshole.  Fuck that shit.  Smash it at the end.  What was it?  It was probably some mundane, dumb thing, right?  Yeah, it's nothing.  What was it? 
[02:46:30]  Um, he wanted to fucking blow me.  It's weird.  It's the weirdest fucking thing.  He said, I want to suck that cock.  Oh, Mars is here and he's awake.  That's good.  Oh, Mars.  Wow, taking charge.  He just wants to do dinner next, dinner.  Lunch.  Lunch next week.  I did the lunch thing with him.  It was fun.  Yeah?  Yeah, you'll have a good time.  Can I get a spicy steak?  There were spices on it. 
[02:47:00]  There were spices on it.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what happens sometimes.  Good steak when there's spices on it.  The Cuban was just telling us about Guy Fieri's fight with his hairdresser.  Oh, shit.  What happened about that?  I have no idea.  The mad Cuban locked up.  Cuban.  He locked up.  The mad Cuban lives his life wisely by the saying, loose lips sink ships.  Yeah, shut your mouth, you live longer.  Yeah?  I'm getting fired for just being in here.  Why?  Why am I going to start saying crazy shit on the house?  Oh, you're not going to get fired.  You shouldn't get fired. 
[02:47:30]  Come on.  You don't worry.  You do all this bullshit work for him.  No one on this show or involved or surrounded by this show has ever been just fired for something.  Holy shit.  What a wake of destruction we've left in our past.  Hey, I got a communique from Dr. Steve.  What a stupid fuck.  Oh.  His name is Dr. Steve.  He's home with the flu and has a fever of 105.  Oh, Dr. Steve.  He doesn't get the flu shot? 
[02:48:00]  What a terrible doctor.  105 is a high temperature, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's call him and make sure he's all right.  You know what he needs?  He's not.  Floods.  Floods.  He's got to drink plenty of floods.  Floods.  Ah, floods.  Why would you make sure he's definitely not all right?  I want to yell at him for not getting a flu shot.  I don't trust flu shots.  I don't get them.  I go flu shot.  I never get them.  I've never gotten a flu shot.  Government control of you.  I'm not.  I would.  I got flu shot.  And hope.  But I've gotten the flu a couple of times.  It's cut down my sickness drastically.  And how much stronger are you now?  In the winters. 
[02:48:30]  You're better.  If you feel like, yeah, I beat that fucking flu.  Fuck that flu in the face.  Yep.  When the zombie invasion comes and stuff, it's going to take more than a little bite to get  me.  I'm going to fucking, I'll sleep that shit off.  I'm glad we have the same outlook on his future.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Zombie invasions.  Yeah.  You're much more equipped.  I live in a windowless room under the train in Queens.  Oh, shit.  Shit's going down when I hit it.  Well, windowless is pretty good.  I thought your career was doing well.  Oh, man.  It's going all right.  You deserve a window by now. 
[02:49:00]  I live lean.  That's good.  Smart.  I like living lean.  Windowless is very good in zombie invasion, though.  It's great.  I can barricade myself.  Although, it is kind of the Alamo.  It is.  That's your last, because there's no getting out.  No.  No getting in.  But there ain't no getting out, either.  You have to fight your way out.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  I'm thinking about buying a machete.  Machetes work very good against zombies.  I really thought he was going to stay in an apartment with a window.  No.  Why would you do that?  Why would I go and do something stupid like that? 
[02:49:30]  You know what windows are?  Entrance ways for thieves.  They are.  That's what it is.  And sunlight.  Hold on.  Yes.  It's very overrated.  It's terrible.  It goes in my eyes.  I get my vitamin D the natural way by rubbing it on my body.  Dr. Steve, why no flu shot this year?  You're bothering me.  Fuck, I got two flu shots this year.  And you still got the flu.  Yeah, I got a, you know, the trivalent vaccine that my company used.  They must have bought the cheap shit from me. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, God.  My kids got the flu mist, which is a live vaccine.  Wait, what happened?  If your kids get it, then you get it, too.  Hold on a minute.  This is some drama.  What happened, Roland?  What happened?  What's going on with that?  What's up, guys?  What happened?  The Cuban just mouthed the words, holy fuck, this is for real?  What, you're really in trouble with Guy Fieri?  No, I don't know what the hell's going on.  The Cuban thought that...  He thought guys would come in here after the last interview.  Yeah, he thought there would just be like the punchline, oh, guy's coming in. 
[02:50:30]  And then Roland was like, no, guy's not coming in.  And the Cuban was...  No, yeah, we just want the Cuban.  The Cuban goes, holy fuck, this is for real?  You work for him?  Yeah, he...  Oh, no, nothing more.  He runs the joint in Times Square.  Oh, shit.  The mad Cuban is the real deal.  Look at him, he's popping Rolaids.  Holy shit, Cuban.  He's going to start drinking Maalox out of the bottle.  Yeah, yeah.  That's antacid shit.  He's an old detective.  Right.  You guys are real tech shit.  Are you two going to get in a little catfight like you did with the hairdressers? 
[02:51:00]  I have no idea what you're talking about with the hairdressers.  I know, I know.  Cuban just realized he made a huge mistake.  Ixnay on the ear quay.  What a fucking ambush bullshit show this is.  This is ambush bullshit.  Ixnay on ye i dee akke ucker se.  I dee agatfe uke.  What the fuck are you saying?  Smart.  Just keep saying that.  You might be all right.  Ixnay on ye i dee akke ape ixnay igbe ikte in ye is ye ass hey. 
[02:51:30]  You guys are fucking mercenaries.  Dr. Steve.  So you got the shitty stuff from overseas and that's why you got sick.  Yeah, I guess.  Even though you got another flu shot that your kids got.  Yeah.  If your kids get the flu mist, that's the intranasal flu vaccine.  It's actually a live attenuated virus. 
[02:52:00]  Attenuated.  Over 50, I'm not allowed to get it.  What the dirty little secret is is that, you know, when you give it to your kids, they  spread it to everybody and so it's supposed to impart sort of community immunity.  Oh, like normally, you know, that gets people sick.  This makes them well.  What's the over 50 thing?  Is that just supply and demand or is it?  Well, since it's a live attenuated virus, they're afraid that oldsters like me will get  sick, you know, actually get sick. 
[02:52:30]  Because you do get a very mild case of the flu from that vaccine, but most of the time  there's no symptoms with it.  And then like the kid walks around sneezing fucking goodness at his little playmates.  Yeah, and he's vaccinating everybody in his head.  Wow.  That's fucking cool.  Sure, you got to suck it out of their penises.  Right.  Jimmy's not here.  I had to.  Oh, God damn it.  Don't make me laugh.  Now, that's a high fever, Dr. Steve, huh?  Yeah, yeah, it was pretty, you know, I, uh, yeah, it was bad. 
[02:53:00]  I woke up and I just was, had chills and I, you know, it was so bad.  This show will do that to you.  I was so bad I couldn't move.  Wow.  Damn, Dr. Steve.  You hallucinating yet?  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm better.  Seeing some of those old people, you put the pillow over their faces.  They're coming back to haunt you.  Why did you do that to me?  You killed me, Steven.  My son.  But, uh, yeah, so I got on the Tamiflu right away. 
[02:53:30]  The Tamiflu.  Is that good shit?  Oh, it's the best shit in the world.  Tamiflu.  Yeah.  Let's all remember Tamiflu.  Tamiflu.  All right.  There's two versions of the anti-influenza medication.  There's one called Relenza that you inhale.  Uh-huh.  And Tamiflu is a pill.  Okay.  And, uh, you know, it works against influenza A and B. So if you do get the flu shot and  you get the flu anyway, they give you the Tamiflu.  You get better.  He's always there with information for everybody. 
[02:54:00]  You know what I like?  Uh, some hot soup.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, a little Robitussin.  Oh.  That's what I like for a flu.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I sit there.  People have to wait on me.  Yeah.  Like, do this.  Get this.  Blanket.  No blanket.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's hot.  It's cold in here.  Bleh.  I'm just laying in my own filth and sweat.  Oh, God.  For a week straight.  Once it breaks, you just sweat it out of you.  It's fantastic.  Beautiful.  And then it's right back on the fucking bottle.  Chug, chug. 
[02:54:30]  All right, Steve.  And we were concerned when you wrote 105.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, it sucked really, really bad.  Yeah.  Man.  All right.  All right, Steve.  Feel better, huh?  Oh, you got flu bag?  I'm still...  Oh.  You got flu bag?  Yeah.  Fever sack.  Fever sack rules.  It's when your testes are, like, they're yearning for that couple of degrees.  Cooler than it's supposed to be.  Oh, yeah.  And when you got a fever, they're, like, hanging down to your knees just trying to ventilate.  Holy shit. 
[02:55:00]  Crazy.  Oh, Jesus.  I still am a big proponent of the flu shot, so...  Oh, yeah.  I'm so glad it's working for you.  Do I say...  All right, boys.  Not what I do.  Bye-bye.  Here's Medicine, Saturday nights at 9 p.m. on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Feel better, sir.  Yeah.  And Riotcast.  All right.  Like, I'm right with the clogs.  He's got a fever.  He's delirious.  Yeah.  All right, boys.  All right.  There you go.  That's, like, a weird thing someone says before they die. 
[02:55:30]  Right.  Like, yeah, 9 o'clock.  Right.  What was his last words?  Something about Riot?  Oh, fuck.  Dan Soder in studio.  Yeah.  They're going to ban home plate collisions in 2014, huh?  Of course they are.  They're banning anything that made sports great.  Tackling...  We're going to flag football in two seasons.  Dude, how exciting are those plays at the plate like that?  They're the best.  That is like, you see it coming.  You're like, holy shit, he's going for it.  Where's the ball?  Oh, fuck.  He's throwing.  He's right on the mark. 
[02:56:00]  He's the catcher.  It's like a whole build-up where it's like, this is going to be great.  Right.  And then what?  Now what?  They're fucking that up.  I didn't realize there were so many concussions happening because of that.  Oh, there's a ton.  Why are we surprised with this science?  It's two grown men slamming into each other.  Of course it's going to hurt somebody.  There's head injuries in the NFL, and of course there's concussions at the plate.  Yeah.  The plate collision with the full count and the home run and the diving catcher, the only  four things that save baseball.  Yes. 
[02:56:30]  Everything else is just standing around, waiting.  Waiting for something.  It's amazing.  Waiting for a home plate collision that you're not going to see.  The fact is, you see it brewing.  You're like, oh shit, here it comes.  And then crack, there it goes, oh fuck, this is going to be close.  This is going to be close.  I love it.  And there's nothing better than the catcher pulling up the mitt, being like, I still got  it.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, he's right in the ump's face.  Yeah, that bitch-ass third baseman.  I got that fucking thing.  The fucking runners there with a snap neck laying on the fuck.  Like he's holding up a severed head.  Oh, that's right. 
[02:57:00]  I still fucking got it.  Yeah, he's holding it.  Right.  That's great.  Of course they're going to ban that.  They're going to ban everything.  Oh, man.  And you don't agree with all the nonsense with the NFL, right?  When they're banning everything.  When the Niners lost to the Saints because of that hit Ahmed Brooks put on Drew Brees,  which was completely legal, he fucking sacked him.  And then they're like, but Drew's hurt.  Drew's bleeding.  Wasn't that the first day the rule was like enacted?  It was, yeah, it was, how many weeks ago?  Four weeks ago?  And the Niners lost because of it and basically lost the chance to have a home playoff game. 
[02:57:30]  You know, I mean, Seattle's good, but fuck, that sucks.  Who's going to win it this year?  49ers?  I know.  I think the Niners have a shot.  I don't want to.  I'll tell you who I don't want to see winning.  That's Seattle.  Really?  It's a pretty good story out there, though.  I fucking hate them.  I'm having a hell of a year.  Yeah, they do.  With their cyclone, dumb stadium that's built.  Piped in noise. 
[02:58:00]  They cheat.  They pipe in noise.  They pipe in crowd noise.  Pete Carroll's a cheater.  Uh-huh.  I love Pete Carroll.  He's got his facial surgery.  What kind of surgery?  He got some things tightened up?  You can tell he got tightened up.  Some work, as they say.  He's had some work done.  You know, you're not an NFL coach and your fucking cheekbones are that smooth.  Oh, my God.  When you're constantly worrying.  Yeah, football coaches shouldn't get tightened up.  They don't age well.  Right.  They're supposed to look like shit.  Doesn't Ditka look like he's had something done?  I'm sure Ditka had something. 
[02:58:30]  All the famous ones.  Fucking weird.  Yeah, the famous ones.  The ones that are Hollywood, i.e. Pete Carroll and his dumb chew chomping.  The way he chews his gum.  You know who hasn't, though?  Hey, you need this cable.  Oh.  What?  Time Warner?  Yeah, Time Warner.  Time Warner Cable.  Time Warner Cable.  With Time Warner Cable.  You've got all those years in Pittsburgh.  Right.  Just freezing Bill Cowher in his dumb lower jaw.  Yeah, he's still defrosting from his Pittsburgh years. 
[02:59:00]  I love that.  Tom Coughlin is, I think, how much older is Tom Coughlin than Pete Carroll?  And they look 20 years different.  Sure.  And they're pretty close in age.  Yeah.  Do you think?  Yeah.  Pete Carroll's the second, from what I think, this is a bar stat, second oldest coach in  the NFL.  No.  That's what I've heard.  I'm definitely wrong.  Wow.  But I just like saying that as a 49er fan.  Because fuck Pete Carroll.  I think Pete Carroll.  I don't know.  You look at, what's his name with the fucking hat from Dallas? 
[02:59:30]  Lane Phillips?  Years ago.  Oh, Tom Landry?  Yeah, yeah.  Tom Landry was an old motherfucker.  Yeah, there are a lot of old guys.  Or were they just like, did they just look old and we were like kids?  It was the 70s, yes.  It was like, oh, he's 40.  And we're like, wow, that guy's old.  He's like 70.  Tom Landry retired at 48.  Fact.  48?  Yep.  Come on.  Did he really?  Yeah.  He looked old.  See?  Pete, that's what I'm saying.  NFL coach.  I believe it.  It's so foolish.  You know, it's funny.  I'm just that.  No way.  That's probably where I got the Pete Carroll stat. 
[03:00:00]  Is someone who's saying some shit like that.  And I'm like, oh, it's true.  You're fucking with you, yo.  Yeah.  We've got to play this Megyn Kelly drop.  Oh, this is like ridiculous.  So.  Who's Megyn Kelly?  Okay.  Fox News.  You ever see?  She does the Megyn thing.  She talks about Santa.  And she talks about Jesus.  Santa and Jesus.  What do you think Jesus looks like?  Oh, man.  He would.  Before I had knowledge, I thought he had blonde hair and blue eyes. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  And then I got knowledge and realized, okay, he's got to be Middle Eastern of some sort.  And then you realize that knowledge that you got was all the liberal media trying to make you feel bad.  Like a mix between Frampton and Clapton.  Yeah.  Yes.  With a little Fabio tossed in.  Yeah, a little bit.  Sure.  Sure.  I'm talking early 90s, Fabio.  This Jesus dude was a bit Middle Eastern.  I'm very Middle Eastern. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  He'd have to be a Middle Eastern guy, right?  It's one of the first lies that was told to us.  And then you're like, what?  Yeah.  He's not blonde with blue eyes.  He definitely, definitely was very uncomfortably Middle Eastern.  Probably uncomfortably Middle Eastern.  You're right.  No one wants to think of Jesus.  Probably way darker than those statues we see in our churches.  No one wants to think of Jesus as like your cab driver, though.  Buddy, buddy, I die for your sins, buddy.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, what do you do?  I walk on water.  I don't want to do wine. 
[03:01:30]  What do you want?  Water into wine.  No, Brooklyn.  I don't go Brooklyn.  Well, Hollywood made him sound like he spoke perfect English.  I just want to die.  Right.  He's got the Charlton Heston voice.  Moses.  He's got Moses' voice.  Moses.  Moses.  Megan Kelly.  I mean, most of them on TV are dumb and stupid.  That's why I love watching local news.  Local news is one of my favorite pastimes.  That tone that they always have?  I can't get enough of it.  I fucking love it.  I get my coffee going on Saturdays and Sundays because my kids get up early, and I tune in 
[03:02:00]  to local news here in New York.  It is hilarious.  I love the camaraderie.  Oh, thanks, Diane.  Yes.  Right.  They have such camaraderie with each other.  They know they're better than the other channel, and they're going to prove it.  Why don't you guys come to News 4, where news happens first?  Does it?  All right.  Fuck.  You're not getting the same alerts as everyone else in town.  You guys are just all taking it off the AP wire.  Right.  Bob, now this weather this week. 
[03:02:30]  Wow.  Mary, it's getting better, though.  Let me go to the map here.  But don't kill the messenger.  You know.  We're going to have a nice cold front moving into the least.  You brought us such beautiful weather this week.  Is it going to continue?  I am to win the rules.  Yeah.  The sports guy can't be bothered waking up early, so he tapes his shit at night.  I love it.  And they make believe he's there.  I love all the dumb.  They do that, yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah, it's so obvious.  We're going to go to Vic with sports.  Right.  It's like just fucking generic shit, and they try to make it look like he's there. 
[03:03:00]  I love when they, when you watch a local news anchor try to work through a problem on air.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're not involved in the story.  They're so distracted.  There was one last night about they were amazed that people were buying guns offline.  Right.  And the other newscaster was just like, so they're just, it's like Craigslist for guns.  Yeah.  That's what it is, you dipshit.  I can't believe that the story has surfaced. 
[03:03:30]  Fuck.  Thank you.  It all goes back, in college, I had a professor, I was a journalism major, and I had to take  broadcast writing with a weekend weatherman.  Oh, wow.  And he was the biggest cocksucker in the horse.  Oh, yeah, he's miserable.  And he always had the weekend weather tone.  Even when he talked, you know those people that talk off air as they do on air?  Like they do on air.  He talked exactly like that.  You'll hear these same shitty voices as soon as we turn the mics off. 
[03:04:00]  That's what you get with us.  Yeah, that's great.  That's how it should be.  Record high temperatures today.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Then they talk about weather like you've never seen snow before.  Like, what is this craziness around us?  Get those mittens out and get those kids ready to do some sledding.  The thing that annoys me the most, though, with the forecast are, and snow for our area.  And meanwhile, our area covers, like, this mountainous region that no one's in. 
[03:04:30]  Cuban, oh, there's Guy Fieri.  He didn't even look in.  Wait, Cuban, get him back in.  Oh, Cuban's taking his head.  Oh, Guy Fieri.  Come here.  Cuban.  Cuban.  Come here for a sec.  I want to talk to you.  No way.  Cuban, come on in.  Wow.  That was a diss by him.  He may believe he was on the phone as he walked by our studio and would not look in here.  Oh, you guys are bad.  What?  What happened?  I don't know what happened.  Is he mad at us?  What?  You're small.  I'll find you.  Oh, shit. 
[03:05:00]  Wow, that was a diss.  Merry Christmas.  Oh, wow.  That was a diss.  Let's see.  Did we completely fuck up the relationship between Cuban and Guy Fieri and between Guy Fieri and us?  What do you think?  Look, Cuban is about 100 feet behind him at this point.  There's going to be a real teeth-clenched conversation between Guy and Cuban.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we booked the mad Cuban.  Roland, what's up?  Roland knows stuff.  Come on, Roland.  They're gone.  Dude, tell them it's the end of the year.  Yeah, we're just being goofy. 
[03:05:30]  And a side note, if you were to ask me, if you were like, hey, how does Guy Fieri wear a hat?  I would have been like, flat-billed and over his eyebrows.  And you'd be like, you're damn right he does.  You're damn right.  Rock and roll cook right there.  No, no, everything's good.  All right, good.  Santa Claus should not be a white man anymore.  Where's this?  This is that Fox News report.  They're talking about this article on Slate.  I guess it's a black chick.  And she says Santa Claus should be a penguin.  What?  Because it makes a black and white. 
[03:06:00]  We're getting another dirty look from the human beach ball, by the way.  Hey, who's that?  That's Sherry Shepard, right?  Who's that one, though?  Right there with the black.  She gave us a dirty look, too.  I swear to God.  That was a real Bobby Heenan comment that he came with.  He was like, look at that, human beach ball.  I'm like, fucking real heel announcer right there.  Oh, my God.  She's dressed in pink today.  What was that fucking treat?  What was it called?  Snowball.  Snowball, yeah, yeah.  She's a human snowball.  Delicious, by the way.  What if she was just looking in?  She gave us some nasty look, too. 
[03:06:30]  What if she was just looking in?  You see, this is why we're, like, I told you, everybody assumes everything's bad in here.  You are the dude on the corner.  Sherry Shepard gave us a dirty look.  And Michelle Obama is fucking pissed.  They're trying to spin that one, too.  Fuck that.  She was pissed.  Oh, about the selfie?  Yeah.  Well, now they call it racist if you make fun of it or say that it was, because you're saying,  oh, you're buying into the stereotype about the over-sexed black man and the angry black woman. 
[03:07:00]  No.  I just saw a twat that was really pissed off that someone was, you know, sort of flirting with Obama.  Hey, fuck it.  Happens.  That's what people do.  That's a very normal man and woman argument.  Oh, yeah.  And then, of course, they have to throw a race into it and make everyone feel weird.  She was pissed.  Period.  She's like, why the fuck are you?  I don't care what color she was.  She was pissed off.  Exactly.  Any woman would be.  Take any relationship and put a cute girl with a British accent, try to take a picture with the guy while his girlfriend's sitting next to him.  No one's going to be, no woman's going to be happy. 
[03:07:30]  But she is right.  Sisters, don't be playing with that shit.  Mm-mm.  Yeah, well, I'm going to sit between Obama and your white ass now, bitch.  Listen here, Snow Angel.  This is my man.  My man.  Listen here, white bunny.  So they want Santa to not be white anymore, but the guy that came up with Santa, or whatever.  Wait, what do you mean?  What does it face on?  This is how I find out Santa isn't real.  Oh, boy, yeah.  Spoilers for the kids out there that are listening. 
[03:08:00]  What?  I know what name to give him if he's not white anymore.  What is it?  Well, it's St. Nicholas.  You can change that around pretty easily.  Wow.  Yeah.  How would you spell it, though?  Gigi.  Yeah.  I think it would be cool.  You could add some Qs to the name.  That's true.  An apostrophe.  Nicholas.  Nicholas.  That faint Nicholas.  So what's the point of this article?  This black lady who thinks that Santa Claus should be all-encompassing?  So in your homes, let Santa Claus be whatever the fuck you want. 
[03:08:30]  She says that black kids are tougher to relate.  But in society, we've already kind of accepted that he's a white dude.  Period.  How is that?  It's the guy that brings free shit to your house.  Of course it's the white man.  Oh, Christ almighty.  It's like welfare.  Just think of it like welfare, okay?  Me and my tax dollars going to you, and you're doing nothing.  We were having fun.  Oh, sorry.  We were all having a good time.  What happened?  They got very militia meeting.  Yeah.  A guy for everything's got me all twisted. 
[03:09:00]  Why don't you go figure it out?  I can't figure that out for the life of me.  That's a speech that you give in the hills of Virginia.  Yeah.  You want to bring him in here and try to cash it out?  Oh, no.  Is he still here?  There ain't no way I want to go through that.  He's just flattening his bill out more and more on his hat.  That really bugged you.  That really bugged me.  I ain't going through that at one minute to ten on Friday.  I don't like the fact that Guy Fieri wears his hat the same way as a 14-year-old black kid.  That really bugs the shit out of it.  He was taking a fake phone call as he walked by us. 
[03:09:30]  That was a fake phone call.  That was fake.  Because they all have to walk by us today.  That's why we're getting a lot of action.  A lot of people avoid this studio.  Oh, Guy Fieri.  Because it's like a maze, but because of what they're doing in the front,  they all have to come this way to leave.  And they have to shoot you shit looks.  That's amazing.  Yeah, the human beach ball definitely fucking gives us luck, too.  Probably not.  So Megyn Kelly's talking about this article, I guess?  Yeah, but her thing is like...  The part two of these clips is what I really want, but we'll go with part one first. 
[03:10:00]  Right.  So in Slate, they have a piece on .com, Santa Claus should not be a white man anymore.  And when I saw this headline, I kind of laughed, and I said, oh, this is so ridiculous.  Yet another person claiming it's racist to have a white Santa.  You know?  And by the way, for all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white, but this person  is just arguing that maybe we should also have a black Santa.  But Santa is what he is, and just so you know, we're just debating this because someone wrote  about a kid.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  You know, all those kids. 
[03:10:30]  This is all the kids that have fucks on to them.  Yes.  Excuse me, mother, I'll take my hot chocolate in the kitchen.  I want to read this story.  Yeah, there's a lot of Alex P. Keetans out there watching Fox News.  Mommy, you turned off Fox News.  Oh, sorry.  And then I was reading the stock reports, and they said that Slate.com has Santa as a black  man, which clearly cannot work.  Oh, boy, Sean Hannity.  When I grow up, I want to be Bill Waiwi. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  I think most people think Santa's white, whatever.  Santa's always been portrayed in your house, whatever.  It's like Santa.  Santa's made up.  He's not white or black or a penguin or anything.  But there are made up black people or cartoons or things like that that you don't just all  of a sudden, you know, you don't make Fat Albert and go, oh, man, we got to make Fat Albert  a white guy.  But we don't all, I mean, Fat Albert's not a cultural thing. 
[03:11:30]  He's just a black part, too.  Oh, yes, he is.  It's not like they're saying Eric Hartman needs to be black.  Fat Albert was certainly a cultural thing.  Not like Santa.  Pretty close.  Well, sorry.  We invented Santa, too.  We invented that and, you know, a moon rocket.  See what happens there?  Or you can get, you're right, maybe your Santa can be black.  If you're into the whole cuckold thing, Santa kissing, Mama kissing Santa Claus is a whole.  Oh, damn, that's right.  It's a whole new thing.  Prepping the bull. 
[03:12:00]  This is where Megyn Kelly loses everybody.  So the Santa thing, whatever.  But then she continues.  Just because it makes you feel uncomfortable doesn't mean it has to change.  You know, I mean, Jesus was a white man, too.  But, you know, it's like we have, he was a historical figure.  I mean, that's a verifiable fact.  Really?  A fact.  There's one of the kids watching to know that.  Verifiable fact?  First of all, I got to say this.  It's going to upset a lot of religious people.  The existence of Jesus isn't even an undeniable fact. 
[03:12:30]  But it's nothing.  Recorded history wasn't good enough to absolutely prove any of that.  They feel certain that a man like Jesus lived.  Well, you know what?  There's no nothing but written words.  It doesn't mean that he had the magical powers that the Bible say.  There's nothing.  There's no artifacts of him.  There's no, like, you know.  They don't have a Jesus femur.  Right.  A Jesus femur.  He was just locked up in a history museum.  Right.  There were no white people back then in that area of the world. 
[03:13:00]  No, we were all up north.  We were making cool shit.  Building great shit.  Yes.  Deciding we wanted to leave our land and building giant ships.  Yes.  Sailing rivers.  Like the amazing people.  I think it's stupid.  I think it's stupid to say Jesus was white.  Period.  Yes.  I think it's completely ridiculous to say that.  If he existed, which he's saying he did.  Right.  He was 100% not a white guy.  Right.  The odds are he was not a white guy.  Well, he was half God.  What if God, we all know, is an older white gentleman with a big white beard. 
[03:13:30]  So whatever the Middle Eastern part of it.  And we know God was white.  Miracle baby.  You got Mary.  Which.  Right.  She is technically from the Middle East.  And she, but then you mix it with God.  So you have a nice Colin Kaepernick.  Colin Kaepernick is the son of God.  I get what you're saying.  And something tells me God probably has the dominant genes in the whole thing.  Are you sure?  God looks and goes, he doesn't even look like me. 
[03:14:00]  You got your chin from your mother.  You got your mom's dumb brown eyes.  Not my gorgeous white man blue eyes that God has.  These blue eyes get you further in life, though.  I've got to be honest with the people.  Oh, yeah.  That's why they painted him in on Jesus, on the great portrait.  Jesus would be wearing blue contacts if he could.  Blue eyes, blonde hair, gorgeous locks.  We've got to go back to the Dutch on this one.  Randy in Minnesota.  Randy.  Yeah.  The Dutch just got done finishing up with Sinterklaas, which is their Santa Claus. 
[03:14:30]  But he has a helper called Jvart Pete, which translates to Black Pete.  And he's black.  He's made up of black face.  Oh, Jesus.  We all don't appreciate the black face anymore.  Ever since the minstrel shows.  That's been a big issue lately in the Netherlands.  Yeah, it comes up every Christmas.  All right.  Whatever.  All right.  You got Santa with a black helper. 
[03:15:00]  Thank you.  Tommy in Canada.  Tommy.  Can you hear us?  Yeah.  Yellow.  He goes, yep.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey.  Yeah.  I was just listening to the show.  I was calling him to say that the Romans had it documented that they crucified somebody  named Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Is that undeniable proof of Jesus' existence?  The fact that he's white?  It's on a tablet.  Megan said Jesus was a historical figure, and that's undeniable. 
[03:15:30]  That right there is not true.  It's just not.  There's still some denial there.  Yeah.  I, you know, they're just the record keeping on the whole Jesus thing, you know, like,  like between birth and fucking 37 or whatever it is.  Yeah.  They lost track of them.  They lost everything.  There's no Jesus doing anything.  And before that, the Old Testament people were living for like 400 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to believe that.  And this one begat that one, and that one begat that one, and begat, begat, begat. 
[03:16:00]  It's a very Kentucky-like.  Yeah.  Hey, begat him, and begat.  He lived for 500 years.  That's the only religion where you're allowed to fuck your hot daughters, so I mean.  Well, that's true.  Wow.  Wouldn't want to do that.  All right.  Well.  You fucking twisted bastard.  All right, Tommy.  Thank you for that.  I'm eight.  This guy says, last I checked, Jesus was a Jew.  Oh, yeah, Jew?  A Jew.  Yeah, they do that thing.  I just don't think he was blonde. 
[03:16:30]  No.  Or white-white.  No.  Hell no.  Oh, no.  It's just something, you know.  If you're going to make a magical guy out of a storybook, he could be whatever the fuck  color you want him to be.  And he's going to be jacked, no body fat.  Right.  Swimmer's body.  Yeah.  He was working out back then.  But whenever you have a Santa argument and you pepper in some Jesus, you're in trouble.  Yeah, you're mixing two worlds that just do not even exist together.  Superman versus Hulk Hogan. 
[03:17:00]  Yes.  The Jesus part of Christmas is one thing.  The Santa part has nothing to do with the Jesus part.  And most people, you know, celebrate the Santa part more than the Jesus part.  Yes.  That's why I don't, you know, take it seriously as a religious holiday anymore.  Hey, it's Santa.  It's shopping.  It's the reason people stop watching it.  It's way more about Santa than the baby Jesus.  It's a tree.  The tree has nothing to do with baby Jesus.  Right.  The songs.  All the songs are super date rapey.  Yes.  Right.  Every song's like, it's cold. 
[03:17:30]  Ah, you're mine.  You said no, but I'm still going to keep going for it.  And release Kenny to get your car, and then we'll do this one last thing, and then the  car will be there for you.  Kenny!  Please.  Kenny!  Let's wrap it up.  While you get your car, we'll be able to play this clip real fast.  All right.  Because it's in the same vein.  Bill Donahue, our pal there.  Oh, right.  Bill Donahue from the Catholic League.  They're outraged about a Festivus pole being put next to a nativity scene. 
[03:18:00]  Festivus, of course, from Seinfeld.  Right.  But now a nearly six-foot-tall Festivus pole made from empty beer cans about to go up at  the floor.  All right.  You know what?  There it goes.  Aluminum.  You know what?  Bill Donahue might have a point.  It is aluminum, though, like Frank Costanzas.  You can't make things out of beer cans and put it next to a nativity scene and assume  people are going to be all right with it.  Bunch of tall boys glued together.  There you go.  Some Natty-like cans.  Is Bill Donahue only... 
[03:18:30]  This might just be him participating in Festivus.  This could be his airing of grievances.  All right.  Let's see.  It's part of Festivus.  It's part of a not-so-subtle protest against the nativity scene already on display there.  Bill, I am so outraged by this.  Why do I have to drive around with my kids to look for nativity scenes and be like...  Who does that anyway?  This broad doesn't drive around looking for nativity scenes.  Let's drive around looking for nativity scenes.  It's Tuesday.  Put on your sweaters.  We're going to go find baby Jesus.  If you stumble upon one, you might go, oh, that's kind of cool. 
[03:19:00]  All right.  Anyway, you don't go looking for them.  Do you know where there's any good nativity scenes?  Right.  Nativity scene.  Oh, here's one.  Oh, wait.  That's just a homeless family sleeping in front of a fucking church.  Right.  With a pet lamb.  I thought it was a pet lamb.  It's like the word is out that there's one on the other side of town.  You've got to see it.  Have you seen the Fredrickson's nativity scene?  Real baby.  Yes.  Real baby in the cold.  It's freezing.  They all look the same.  There's nothing special. 
[03:19:30]  Now, what does she go on to say when she...  Oh, yeah, kids, look, there's baby Jesus behind the festivus pole made out of beer cans.  It's nuts.  Remember a couple years ago when the Supreme Court decision is to the gays in their own contingent  could not watch the St. Patrick's Day Parade.  Gays?  Okay.  Leave it aside to the private segment of it.  We don't want to have the Klan out there on Martin Luther King with their monuments right  next to a bust of Martin Luther King.  Speak for yourself.  We don't want to have neo-Nazis out there to stick at the Jews on Yom Kippur.  Wow.  And we shouldn't have people out there ready to thrash Christianity given that proximity. 
[03:20:00]  Let them do it some of the time and some of the place.  I don't think Festivus is a genocidal fucking little holiday that's trying to do away with  Christianity and Christians and Christmas.  And if you believe, who gives a fuck what other people think of what you believe in?  It's a fucking pole.  It's a pole.  They're acting like it's a giant poster.  And Festivus isn't for them anyway.  It's for the rest of us.  Yeah.  Right.  It's Festivus for the rest of us.  I'd like to see him in a feat of strength. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, yes.  Try the feats of strength.  Phil Donnie.  Oh, Phil Donnie.  Oh, Phil Donnie.  Or Phil Donnie.  I'd love to see them compete in one.  Oh, what a shithead.  That is the most inane argument, discussion.  I'm sick of driving around for nativity scenes.  And I got to explain to my son, the waterhead, that a giant pullman out of Bud Light cans is not what Jesus wanted. 
[03:21:00]  White Jesus.  Blue-eyed blonde hair.  Blue-eyed, yeah, white Jesus, white Santa.  Gerber baby Jesus.  Yes, yes.  The Easter bunny, I think, is mulatto.  I'm pretty sure.  Oh, really?  I'll even go for that.  Yeah, yeah.  The Easter bunny is mulatto.  Very coarse fur.  Right.  Yes, very kinky.  Yeah.  Kinky fur.  We got to watch that.  We got a great question coming in from John in Atlanta.  Oh.  John.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, I don't know a lot about our religious history, but, you know, if he was crucified on the cross and rose from the dead, was he ever spotted afterwards? 
[03:21:30]  And if so, you know, what did he die from after that?  I mean.  All right.  Wait, you got the resurrection.  A one-way ticket to the resurrection.  Wasn't he just like a zombie thing?  Well, zombie Jesus.  Yeah, zombie Jesus after that.  He was raised from the dead.  Or, yeah, that's a very good question.  Then he ascended to his kingdom.  Oh, he did.  All right.  And to sit at the right hand of his father. 
[03:22:00]  Now, is that like stage right, or is it audience right?  Jesus, when you exit, we're going to need you to go to your right, my left.  Walk and.  I never understood that one.  I imagine Mary is a stage mom.  Smile.  Yeah, yeah.  Smile.  Like toddlers in tears.  Right hand of God.  Right hand of God.  It's all very confusing.  It really is.  So he ascended, which was the ascension.  And they didn't have a chance to die of something else.  No, no, no.  No, he took the Jesus escalator. 
[03:22:30]  Yes.  Up to heaven.  He said, fuck that, and took the easy way out.  He's like, you guys are treating me like shit down here.  Like that rocket tire in Cats.  Yeah.  When that woman, that female cat went up in the rocket tire.  That is very emotional.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Yeah.  He didn't want to see no more humans.  He's like, fuck that.  I gave it a good try.  People stink.  They're insane.  Smite them, Pops.  Smite them.  They're insane.  They need a good smiting.  Dad, just give them a couple thousand more years, and then let's pull the plug. 
[03:23:00]  And then I'll come back.  Oh, that'd be great.  They'll be waiting for it.  That's right.  And I will fucking wreak havoc.  All right, we should go.  Your car is probably ready.  All right.  We didn't even get to hear young Elvis from Montreal.  I swear.  I swear.  Do you want to see it now, or do you want to wait?  I swear to Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  And where's the next live rate?  Here.  All right.  Give it to me.  Give it to me.  Please.  And Dan, where are you going to be? 
[03:23:30]  I'm going to be Buffalo Helium Comedy Club New Year's Eve.  And then Portland, Oregon, beginning of the year.  Nice.  For Helium, too.  We'll have you back sooner than later.  Yeah.  I feel like we've got to give you a make good.  We made you wait way too long.  Oh, no.  It was fine.  You were supposed to be in at 8.30.  I had a good time.  All right.  I'm going to see you Monday.  Bye, Anthony.  Take it easy.  Nice.  Where's this Elvis dude?  Right there.  That's him?  Let me hear this thing.  Okay.  16 years old from Montreal. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  I'm speaking like French and shit.  That doesn't sound anything like Elvis.  David, 16 ans.  C'est donc Blue Christmas.  I have a blue Christmas without you.  I'll never be so blue just thinking about you. 
[03:24:30]  This kid's going to go off the rails.  Decorations of red  On a green Christmas tree  Won't be the same day  If you're not here with me  And when it'll move you  Jesus.  That's pretty cool.  They need to build a French accent in some of the...  Holy shit.  You serious?  Yeah, you can hear it say ting instead of thing. 
[03:25:00]  Ding.  He probably does that too.  Yeah.  Have a blue Christmas.  That kid's going to get pushed so fucking hard.  Wow.  They even have him combing his hair like Elvis.  Yeah.  You don't think his parents are just going to push the shit out of it?  Fuck yeah.  There's money to be made there.  Yeah.  Well...  I hope my kid sounds like Elvis.  I'll push him out.  I'll dye that blonde hair of his.  Steve's dad, Opie.  Fuck yeah.  Get out there.  Make me fucking money.  I want to sit back for a few years. 
[03:25:30]  You'll be like Bieber's mom.  Fuck yeah.  In a second.  Push him to a state of mental insanity.  I'm ready to move on.  Well, we leave you today with Mars snoring during the Ron and Fez show.  Perfect.  Dan, thank you so much.  Good seeing you.  Dan might be sticking around for the after show.  Oh, yeah.  Dan's going to continue with Sam.  Cool.  But this is Mars when he was, you know, supposed to be making sure the studio was back in working  order.  Instead of doing that, he was snoring during the Ron and Fez show.  So we'll leave you with this.  And I do this because I love you, Mars. 
[03:26:00]  Love you.  Miss you, brother.  Have a two.  Go mic, Kim.  Go mic.  As we speak, this band has been working so long that you'll be able to hear this now.  So this is Mars sleeping in the corner.  He's been working on this since yesterday morning.  This is our engineer, Mars. 
[03:26:30]  You might want to get a mask.  I know you have a rough fucking idea, man. 
[03:27:00]  Mars, snoring like that's what killed Reggie White.  You've got to be very, very careful.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, my gosh.  Welcome, everybody, to After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:27:30]  My friends are here.  Dan Soder.  Hi, Sam.  Hi, Dan.  Hi, Sam.  Hi, Dan.  We were just talking about white guys trying to act cool around black dudes, so I'm going  the opposite.  Oh, you're trying to be like, it's a white guy.  I'm going retarded white.  Hi, Sam.  Hi.  Hi, Sam.  Like, whatever black guys would be like, I don't want that dude around me.  Yo, that motherfucker's crazy.  He's got a weird fucking magic going on.  Hi, Sam.  Get that fucking guy away from me.  Hi, Sam. 
[03:28:00]  Friend.  That really wouldn't terrify a black dude.  All right, yeah.  You've got to lean in on it.  Yo, next time you come around here, don't bring that fucking Dan around here no more.  Hey, for real, dude looked at me like right in my eyes and called me his friend.  I don't like that shit.  Are you my friend?  Yo, I don't like that shit.  I don't play that shit.  Don't bring that shit around me no more.  Hi, Sam.  It's bad.  Nicole from the morning mashup is here.  That really sounded like a black man.  Thank you.  That was very good.  That did something for you. 
[03:28:30]  You have a very sexy voice.  Missed the bass.  A little juicy.  It is.  All right.  She also hasn't had sex in seven weeks because she's pregnant and she's got something going  on.  Pregnant women, I've heard, get extremely horny when they're pregnant.  I am extremely horny, but the doctor said it because it's something that's just wrong.  It's going to be fine.  Oh, Jesus.  No, no, everything's fine.  Just please don't have sex for a few weeks.  Yeah.  It's not really working out for me.  I'm like, you know, like you say sex.  I'm like, uh.  Are you kidding?  You're like, oh my God, that man has some bass in his voice.  I'm just like, uh, uh.  Usually she's perfectly safe on this show with my voice. 
[03:29:00]  Do you want to have a better course?  Send a call.  Tell me more about that.  Why was I like getting pregnant?  Your boobs are getting so big.  Big boobs are great.  Meanwhile, I'm like, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, are you getting mad at your husband because you can't have sex?  He's getting mad at me.  Yeah, he is.  He's kind of saying, who cares?  Can we just still do it?  I'm like, no.  Not if you want the baby to survive.  You want some of my handy?  Oh, the tossing blowies, handy, whatever.  I'm a good girl.  Have you given him a handjob?  No.  Okay. 
[03:29:30]  I lied.  I don't give handjobs.  I thought so.  Because you can do it better than I can do it.  But I, the blowjob, you can.  I will jerk off your husband.  Is that what you're asking?  Not you.  I met this guy.  His name's Dan.  He talks like a black dude.  He's going to do his black voice the entire time he jerks you off.  He tells me he's great at handjobs.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Look right at my face, motherfucker.  Look at me in the eyes.  Look at me in the fucking eyes.  For real?  Look at me right in my face.  Why are you so good at it?  It's kind of creepy.  It's the base.  It's the base.  Because I was really good.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because a lot of black men gave him handjobs when he was a child. 
[03:30:00]  Because I was jerked off.  Yeah.  At 12, I was fighting him off with a stick.  No, a handjob can be a fun thing, though.  Because it's like a throwback.  You know what I mean?  It's like, oh shit, this chick who I've banged out so many times, now she's giving me a handjob?  It's kind of hilarious.  It's kind of good during the blowjob.  Both.  Yeah.  Combo.  Mouth-hand combo.  No, I'm telling you, every now and then, like maybe once a year, I'm just like, no.  Just the hand?  Just the hand.  Wait, can I just tell you something?  Like, under the covers.  Like, just leave the covers on and... 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  I feel...  Like, once in a blue moon, I'm like, yeah.  I don't know where to look.  I feel weird.  Like, I'm like in like seventh grade again.  Like, what am I...  Or eleventh grade for some of us, but go on.  Yeah, okay.  Fucking...  Horror.  No wonder you're pregnant.  Somebody was a popular girl.  Oh, fucking...  Well, for real.  Where do you...  Like, what do you do?  I just feel like you can do this.  You know...  Like, the jerking off, I can't.  Well, first of all, you walk in there with that kind of attitude, and I don't care what you're  doing.  If you don't have, like, the attitude of a winner... 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  ...then I don't want you in the bedroom to begin with.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry about that.  Like, what exactly do you want me to do?  I want you to fucking leave and call one of your friends.  I need...  Because she comes in here.  Stone cold determination.  Yeah.  I need...  You need semen out of me.  Texas accent?  Yeah.  Well, if you want to mess with the rattlesnake, I'll give you a handjob.  I want a nice stone cold Steve Austin handjob.  And that's the bottom line, because I jerk...  Listen here, McMahon.  I'm going to jerk you off all over my muscular shaved chest. 
[03:31:30]  I'm going to make you come all over the rattlesnake.  And you can bet your bottom dollar that my armpits are shaved, too.  If you want me to jerk you off with my big, meaty hands, give me a hell yeah.  Hell yeah!  Wow.  Yeah, nice stone cold fucking jerk off.  Yeah, stone cold determination.  I got it.  All right.  My bad.  I'll work on it.  Yeah, you can't walk in there and be like, what do you want me to do?  I don't know.  Why do you want me to do that?  Because you're my wife, and it's your duty. 
[03:32:00]  I'm going to give a confident handjob tonight.  I'm going to do it.  Try it.  But don't be...  Don't let it turn into an aggressive, militant handjob.  Okay.  Like an Indian burn.  You like this, don't you?  No.  No, I don't.  I'm sorry I wanted to have sex with you.  Let me go to Chris in New Jersey.  What's up, Chris?  Sam, I just wanted to let you know, wait until your wife's 37 weeks pregnant, because all  you're going to do is be able to get jerked off, because you ain't going to be a little  fucker.  Why?  Why not?  Not even from behind? 
[03:32:30]  Nice, Nicole.  Nice.  What a soldier, Nicole.  Belly's the only thing stopping you, I feel.  Oh, it's just, I don't know.  You can't, like, do that deal where she's laying down and you're standing up, right?  And the belly's sticking up in the air.  Yeah.  Man, that just weirds me out.  Does it?  You don't want to fuck a pregnant girl?  I've never been through the process.  Okay.  So I don't know, but I just know when, even when you said blowy, I was like, ah, man.  You don't want to get blown by a pregnant girl?  You don't want to blow a pregnant girl?  I don't know.  There's a kid.  There's a kid around.  I'm now undesirable? 
[03:33:00]  No, no, not at all.  I'm just saying, I'm imagining you're not pregnant.  Just rub the belly, like, feel a kick while you're getting blown.  Oh, dude.  It's fucked up.  Oh, Nicole, hang on a second.  She's kicking.  Oh, she stopped.  Go back.  Go back.  Okay, hold on.  I need her to kick again for me to finish.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  Fucking gross.  Did that ever happen?  She's totally listening.  She is, right?  And my dumb bassy voice is probably right in that womb right now. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  She ever do that?  She ever kick while you're giving a blowy?  Yeah, she doesn't ever stop kicking.  Oh, ruins it for him.  He's looking to throw up, dude.  You don't like that.  I can't do it.  What's the opposite?  You want me to be fucking, my jeans all tight?  Oh, yeah.  Kicking, huh?  Body by bottom lip.  She ever fucking punch your belly?  She'll punch your belly while you?  She probably does kick your belly.  You're a bad girl.  Yeah.  You're a bad girl.  Baby's kicking because you're bad.  You're a bad mama.  What?  That's your kid.  You're a bad mama.  You're a bad mama. 
[03:34:00]  Man, what if she's just laying off to the side and doing it, but you don't feel it, but  you just see it going on?  No.  Right.  No.  Right.  What if you just see the belly?  You see the stomach moving?  No.  There's like a hand pushing through.  You just see a hand come through the skin.  Fucking alien one when you're getting up.  I love this too.  Oh, fuck.  All of that.  And you're like, am I having sex with my daughter right now?  I don't know what's going on anymore.  If you want to make me as soft as a baby.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't know.  Maybe when the time comes when I do have children, it'll be like, yeah. 
[03:34:30]  But your husband, you said, was like, when he got to have sex with you while you were  pregnant, he was like, that's off the bucket list.  No, you know, not the sex with me pregnant.  He wanted to jizz on my belly pregnant.  That's right.  What?  That's what it was.  He did that.  That's a biker bucket list.  And you know that's true.  I've always wanted to sling my rope.  Oh, just, you know, on the stomach of a pregnant lady.  What kind of Sturgis bullshit is that?  Well, I screamed while it was happening.  What are you doing?  And he was like, oh, I always wanted to do that. 
[03:35:00]  I've always wanted to do this.  I'm coming.  And I'm coming where I put my cum.  And my cum made something.  My poor daughter is going to hear this one day.  I'm a horrible mother.  She will.  We have lots.  This is a great thing because she announced her pregnancy here on the after show.  And since then, as we've been talking about, she's got all kinds of tapes that she can  one day play for little Samantha.  It's a baby book.  That's right.  It is.  Tied in a little bow.  She'll be like, mommy, remember when you were talking to that black white man?  Blackest white man.  And he talked about how you, but I'm saying, we were talking about white guys that try 
[03:35:30]  to appeal to black dudes.  Yeah.  That happens often.  It happens a lot.  I get it.  I'm guilty.  I've been guilty of it.  I do it.  I've done it.  But not that bad.  Like, I do it subtle.  I don't Carson Daly.  I get a two, the whole two to neck roll.  Vivica A. Fox was in here.  Yeah, I did it.  And Nicole was a little bad, but not too bad.  Like, I've seen way worse.  You didn't do the thing that, I've seen my mom do it, and white ladies do it, where  sometimes, where they're talking to black ladies, and they go, listen, girlfriend, where 
[03:36:00]  they say girlfriend.  No, your mom did that shit?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I did.  My mom's fucking 65, and you know, she just does it.  I was trying to think of my, I was like, my mom would never do that.  And then I was like, wait, my mom has no black friends.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I did girl.  I did one of those.  Oh, see, that's, yeah, yeah, yeah.  My mom was like, oh, girlfriend, like that.  And you're like, but she said it to white people, too.  Okay.  And you kind of do that ironically with your white friends, too.  Girl.  I do it with my white friends, because it's hilarious.  You like that? 
[03:36:30]  Girl.  He's like, but I'm a boy.  I'm a boy.  And you're like, I know, I'm a comedian.  That's something we do in comedy.  That's how you greet Sam, right?  Yeah, I go, girl.  Hey, girl.  Girl, you be seeing Gaffier, we wearing a hat in the hallway, looking all fucking dumb.  Definitely going to ask you about Guy Fieri in a second.  Sure you are.  But Chris in Canada has a statement to make.  What's up, Chris?  How you doing?  Good.  Good.  I can't believe you guys are not talking about the most desirable thing of having sex with  pregnant women.  Which is your thick-ass Canadian ex. 
[03:37:00]  I have secretly impregnated my wife three times for that reason.  Why?  What's the best?  How do you impregnate?  What?  My wife knows I like having sex with pregnant women so much that she will point out pregnant  women to me walking in the mall or wherever we're at.  Why do you like having sex with pregnant women so much?  Not enough love as a child, maybe?  They're the horniest things out there, my friend.  Is that right?  Yeah.  It's true.  It is phenomenal.  If you ever get a chance, and it don't matter from behind, it don't matter, Nicole, it don't 
[03:37:30]  matter.  It don't matter.  I was going to say-  It all works.  You know that Nicole's husband, he really wanted to jizz him on her pregnant belly.  Yeah.  Because the whole point about being pregnant is you can come inside.  Yeah.  No problem.  Right.  It's fucking no rules.  It's no holds barred.  Yeah.  Which DJ Hook had once referred to.  He said black people call that a baby shower, which I don't know if that's true or not.  I don't know, but I like it.  I do, too.  I think it's creative.  I do, too.  I like that he's just like, you guys aren't talking about the best part of you just get to  fuck, because it's cold. 
[03:38:00]  It's so cold out.  Keep baby warm.  Yeah.  You know, the best part of fucking a pregnant lady is that you know the baby's warm, because  you're on top of her, just pumping and sweating.  Just smothering her.  Yeah.  I'm about to come all over your stomach.  Such a creepy accent.  Sorry.  I love you, Canada.  You don't have to.  They're the nicest fucking people ever.  I was in Calgary like two months ago, and I was just like, this is so much fun, because  it was like, kind of like, Calgary is very similar to Denver. 
[03:38:30]  It's like white people that love cowboy boots and mountains, but then they're like, got that  Canadian niceness to them.  Right.  And you're like, this is uncomfortable.  Right.  Snowy in Michigan.  And they like to back.  Hey, Daniel, how you doing, sir?  What's up, Snowy?  Yeah.  Go ahead and have sex with a kid late in the pregnancy.  You have a kid with one eye born.  Good idea.  Wait, what?  Oh, I'm implicit.  Snowy went for, I mean, Snowy.  Oh, I went for the dick joke.  Right.  Because I'm so dumb that I thought it was science related, and I'm like, what's a semen? 
[03:39:00]  Would semen in the birth canal affect their vision?  I'm sure Matt loved that call.  I think Snowy was saying you could poke a baby with your teeth.  Because you got a big old dick.  Your dick's so big, it's going to poke the baby in the eye.  Snowy, the joke's been made before.  When you're, so you can't have sex, when is the doctor going to give you the green light?  I'm going back in three weeks and checking again.  It's going to be a long three weeks, huh?  Yeah, it's been rough.  That is crazy.  I feel like every time you've come in here in the last three months, all we do is talk  about you having pregnant sex.  Can we just maybe talk about something different? 
[03:39:30]  Let's talk about Guy Fieri.  You know what's really funny about that, though?  Tell me, Dan.  There's definitely one listener, maybe that Canadian dude, that's really disappointed  that we're moving on.  There's one guy that's just touching it over his jeans, and he's like, oh, pregnant chicks,  and I don't care about Guy Fieri.  Yeah.  They don't know radio.  Yeah.  Who's letting these idiots on the air?  The guys go with the hot subject.  Yeah.  There's a reason you've been talking about it for three months, because it's sexy shit.  Right.  And I love it.  I don't want to get out of my car.  I'm late for work.  All this pregnant, hot fucking talk. 
[03:40:00]  Well, Guy Fieri, we saw him today.  Yeah.  Because apparently they're redoing our whole lobby here at SiriusXM.  A bulldozer in the reception area.  Yeah.  They're tearing up all the floor.  Eric was just about to say, I think.  We have a picture?  Yeah.  We put a photo up on the show, Twitter, Instagram, ONA Show.  ONA Show on Twitter and Instagram.  You can see a photo.  The floor in the lobby is already torn up, which is a far cry from the wild Christmas party that was in that lobby last night.  Lame. 
[03:40:30]  Don't say it's lame if you didn't go.  Well, it's lame because I didn't go.  Incorrect.  Denny was over there sexually harassing employees all night.  Maybe we'll get to that in a little bit, too, because I just picked your interest, Dan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  There's nothing better than people being sexually aggressive in the workplace.  Especially when they're Dennis Falcone.  Have you met Dennis Falcone?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  You'll get a kick out of that.  Special man.  But what I wanted to tell you was that, do you know the Cuban he hangs out with Guy Fieri?  I know the Cuban well.  He has the glasses and everything.  He's from Cuba. 
[03:41:00]  And it's the Cuban.  Well, we saw Guy Fieri walk up that hall today.  Because since the lobby's all toe up from the flow up, they can't come in the usual way.  So they have to go in the back door.  All guests now have to go in the back door.  And they have to pass by our studio, which normally the talent department keeps guests  who aren't booked on our show far away from the studio.  Yes, they do.  Because we have a tendency of yelling out the door and trying to get people to come inside.  I'm aware.  Which is a great technique.  Yes.  I'm a big fan of it. 
[03:41:30]  So Guy Fieri looks at his head in the window like he pokes.  And Dan Soder realized that he wears his hat.  Backwards.  No, he was wearing it.  Oh, I wish.  God, I wish he wore it backwards.  And then I would be able to even stomach an episode of Diner Drives in and Dumps.  Dan's been furious all morning at Guy Fieri's hat.  Was it the backwards half to the side?  It was front, full front forward, flat bill.  Oh.  Yeah, over the eyebrows. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, we don't want to do that.  It's bad.  So.  I hate that.  He kind of looked in and gave the thumbs up.  But Opie said on the air, I thought we didn't book him today.  Oh, he probably heard it, too.  And Roland goes, we didn't.  And Opie goes, ooh, awkward.  And then he goes, oh, but the Cuban's with him.  I'll have the Cuban in here.  Oh, no.  And so while Guy was overdoing the Taylor show and the morning mashup show, we had the Cuban  just sitting in here.  And he wasn't even really in here for any reason except to infuriate Guy Fieri. 
[03:42:30]  So that Guy Fieri would find out that the Cuban was in here.  You guys are dicks.  But hilarious dicks.  Hilarious dicks.  I'll give you that.  How was Guy Fieri?  First of all, his effing name is Guy Fieri.  I don't know why.  Okay, well, don't fucking put the accent on.  It's Guy Fieri.  It's Guy Fieri.  Guy Fieri.  Where is he from?  Italy?  Yes, his family's from Italy.  Does he strike you as Italian?  Where is he from?  Santa Rosa, California.  Santa Rosa.  He makes popcorn shrimp and bleaches his hair. 
[03:43:00]  There's not an Italian bone in his body.  I'm not fucking kicking up an accent for his last name.  You know what I get when I go to Guy Fieri's restaurant?  Pretzel chicken tenders.  Oh, they're good.  They are good.  I mean, they're delicious, but they're not Italian.  That's true.  No.  That's a mozzarella.  No.  You know who makes pretzel chicken tenders?  A guy named Guy Fieri.  A guy named Guy.  If your name's Guy.  A guy.  A guy.  A son of Annie.  Yeah.  I thought he was great.  He's always great.  But did he have any, did it seem tense at all? 
[03:43:30]  Because, I don't know, he found out that the Cuban was in here.  Okay, no, he seemed okay.  And while the Cuban was in here.  He was terrified.  He was terrified, but I think he was playing it up for the radio.  Because we saw him get really terrified.  Halfway in.  And you know what it was?  What?  I think it was like one of those things where you think you're sick with something.  Like if you, like whenever you have strep throat, and you're like, shit, I think I have strep throat.  And you're like, kind of nervous.  Then you go to the doctor, and he's like, you do have strep throat.  And you're like, no.  Right.  Like, fuck.  That's what it was. 
[03:44:00]  He was like, I'm in trouble.  And then he was like, oh, shit.  Like, I'm fucked.  He's not going to be in trouble.  At one point, because he's sitting there making comments.  He's sitting next to Danny.  He's like, dude, I'm out of a fucking job.  And then Opie and Anthony start being like, hey, what about the fight guy got into with  his hairdresser?  I didn't ask him about that.  And of course she didn't.  You wanted to keep him as your friend.  I don't ask him the hard-hitting questions.  Because the Cuban looked at Opie when he first brought it up going, what the fuck are you 
[03:44:30]  doing?  Like, why would you ask me that question?  It was great.  You know what he said?  You know what his response was?  What?  I have fucking kids in a family.  You want to see pictures?  I'm not answering that question.  That's how legitimately terrified he was.  And he threatened to show pictures of the people that Guy Fieri pays for.  And after that.  It's not all flat-billed hats.  It's Cuban families that Guy Fieri pays for.  Yeah.  It's not just shirts with flames on them.  Listen, he gets those for free now. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  His money's going elsewhere.  He sells them now.  And then, we're kind of moving on and talking about something else.  Maybe, you know, baseball or whatever.  And Roland leans in and whispers to the Cuban, the guy's kind of getting ready to go.  Get out of here.  And then the Cuban goes, like, I think he said something to the effect of, he's really  not coming in here?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  And then Roland goes, no.  And I saw, it just turned to sheer terror when the Cuban mouthed the words, this is 
[03:45:30]  fucking for real?  Oh, this is going to be douche chills right now, like, hearing this.  And he was like, oh, no.  And then he just started talking to the mic.  He goes, this is fucking bullshit.  This show is bullshit.  Oh, no.  But see, here's, now let's bring up the real problem of this.  Any decent person, if someone did that to me, if I was here and I had, like, an assistant,  and I'd be like, you dicks.  But I'd be smiling, and I'd be like, oh, you guys.  You guys are funny.  I know what you fucking assholes are doing, and I'll see you again when I come back, and I'll 
[03:46:00]  make fun of you that you did this.  I think you were going to say that the real problem was the flat-billed hat.  Well, that was the overarching problem.  Yeah.  That's just the canvas.  Yeah.  That's where all of this gets painted.  That's just.  My husband's, like, fully, like, he's infuriated right now.  He's like, I've had it with Guy Fieri.  Why is he, don't say his name like that.  Don't say his name.  Don't say his name.  Let me tell you about Guy Fieri.  He's always, like, he does the Nicole show, The Morning Mashup, all the time, and it's  Nicole and four dudes that do the show.  And they were on his TV show, and they, like, have this, you know, friendship, but not a 
[03:46:30]  real friendship, like a show.  And when I'm coming back, I got my friends from The Morning Mashup.  But, like, everything that he does, he's always, like, Nicole's my favorite.  I like Nicole.  And just weirdly, like, flirty.  Full throttle.  Yeah.  I like Nicole.  But he's always weirdly, like, flirty with her.  When I'm jerking off with some cornstarch in the back of my walk-in, I'm thinking of 
[03:47:00]  Nicole.  It's actually with popcorn and shrimp batter.  Shrimp batter.  I like to jerk it to Nicole.  Oh, got a piece of pretzel cut in the tip.  Full throttle.  I'm banging it out.  Full throttle.  You guys are such dicks.  And then Nicole told me this story that she said was hypothetical, but I don't think  is hypothetical, about maybe being cornered by a celebrity chef and being like, yo, we  should fuck.  Dang.  Something to that effect.  She says it's hypothetical.  And I was pregnant at the time.  You were pregnant at the time? 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  Hypothetically?  Hypothetically.  I don't think she's ever really been pregnant.  And I think she's just hiding it.  And she's got those things.  So she doesn't have to take that celebrity chef.  Dang.  Full throttle.  I have that.  Full throttle.  Full throttle.  I'm saying, we go in the bathroom, and I go full throttle.  I'm going to pee in my pants.  Mustache ride to flavor.  From fucking E-Rod.  Writes mustache ride to flavor.  Fuck.  There's nothing worse than it's got to be that fucking confidence of a celebrity chef. 
[03:48:00]  Because chefs are insane people.  Right.  I'm friends with some chefs.  They're fucking nuts.  But Anthony Bourdain's the only one that I love.  I live next door to him.  But he's nuts.  You live next door to him?  Yeah.  All right.  We get it.  You're throwing around your money.  Jesus Christ, Nicole.  Well, apparently they're paying some people better around here than others.  Jesus.  God damn it.  Living in that kingdom.  Living in that fucking CNN book.  Oh, Anthony Bourdain.  Money.  He's the neighbor.  I hate you guys.  Oh, he's the neighbor.  Yeah.  You want to know who my neighbor is? 
[03:48:30]  Anthony Deluvio Sr.  The man that owns my building.  He's a good guy.  He lets me smoke weed on the ground level.  They just had to kick a lady out of my building because she made the whole floor smell  like piss because she was a cat lady.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Oh, but my neighbor, Anthony Bourdain.  Bourdain.  How do you say his name?  Do you really fucking lean in on the accent?  We brunch.  Oh, Anthony Bourdain.  Roll that R.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to fuck you in the bathroom.  Full throttle. 
[03:49:00]  So, like, Nicole's husband is cool with everything.  Yeah, because he, I mean, she seems like an unbelievable catch.  Yes.  So, which means when you meet a girl like this, you're always like, oh, well, you're a husband  or boyfriend.  Like, whenever you meet a girl like that, you're like, you're probably dating someone else.  Right.  Like, when I met my girlfriend, I was like, what's your boy, your boyfriend's got to be  really cool.  She's like, I don't have one.  And I was like, well, I'm moving in on this one.  Yes.  And that's what I do.  And now people think you're cool.  It's great how that works out.  That's what happens with my wife, too.  But, yeah, her husband's awesome. 
[03:49:30]  I hang out with him.  He's a great guy.  Is this before or after he hangs out with Anthony Bourdain?  Their neighbor.  Yeah.  By the way, I've been to her apartment.  Yeah.  Never introduced to the neighbors.  Isn't that weird how that works out?  That is weird.  But, like, he's cool with everything.  Like, she talks about sex on the show.  And there's always somebody, like.  Clearly, we're talking about her giving him beach when she's pregnant.  And he doesn't care.  Yeah.  But he's pissed at Guy?  He's, like, had it.  Why is that?  He, like, visibly gets, like, Irish red.  Yeah.  Oh, you're married to an Irishman.  Good.  Why is he? 
[03:50:00]  Matt Ryan.  Matt Ryan.  What is it about Guy Fieri that gets him so mad?  What, the quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons?  No.  That's why Guy Fieri's your fucking neighbor.  Married to the quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons.  No.  Or not Guy.  Anthony Bourdain.  It doesn't matter.  He does get tweets because people think they're like, great game.  But it's not him now.  It's a different one.  So why does he hate Guy Fieri?  He thinks he's oversaturated.  He's sick of him being on my show, of maybe on his show, of hearing about him, of him being on  my DVR.  Because he's trying to get that.  You DVR him?  Yeah.  I love diners driving.  Oh, my God.  It's on all the time, though. 
[03:50:30]  I know.  I watch it with my mom.  It is kind of enjoyable.  Full throttle.  I go, full throttle.  Yeah, but you know why it's enjoyable to you?  Because I'm a stoner and I'm always hungry.  And because he's not trying to get his dick into your girlfriend.  I mean, I'll tell you this right now.  Fact alone, I am so on board with your husband because there's nothing more infuriating than a guy  that you know that wants to bang your significant other and the fact that it's him.  And when he has bleached hair and wears a flat brim cap.  Oh, and the regular colored goatee.  Yeah. 
[03:51:00]  I am on Team Matt Ryan, except not the quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons.  Not that man.  Now, I wonder, though, could you show him the video of Guy fighting, having like a lover's  quarrel?  He's seen it.  We've all seen it.  And he's like, I don't care if Guy might be a closet homosexual.  There's tears.  Let's just put it that way.  What are they fighting about?  There's a TMZ video.  You look it up.  Which I will.  Where Guy...  That was as much for you as it was the listeners, Dan.  I wasn't demanding you do anything.  Where Guy, like, I guess he's drunk. 
[03:51:30]  But he gets into a fight with his hairdresser.  Yeah.  But it's like such a fight that, like, lovers...  How could you?  I think there's a couple.  How could you?  Ow!  And they're, like, swinging.  It's great.  It's the greatest thing you ever saw.  I've never said, how could you, to anyone, ever.  No.  Especially not a dude.  A dude?  No.  But there's not one thing that's pushed him over the edge.  It's just the general guy-ness and disrespecting of the relationship. 
[03:52:00]  Just get off his shit.  I gotcha.  You know what?  It's like, yeah, you're his wife, the mother of his children.  Yeah.  You don't need some dude with bleach blonde hair tossing dick at you.  You know what the problem is?  I got it.  What your husband's dilemma is?  What is it, Sam?  You want to bundle up.  But your husband wants to see some skin.  Right?  I guess that's a problem.  So, how do you have a hot holiday when you're always cold?  Oh, my God.  I really just...

Flavortown.  Yeah.  Where is Flavortown?  I just think it's, everything about today has been perfect.  Yeah?  Well, not quite perfect.  Well, I'm talking about my opinion, solidifying my opinion of Guy Fieri.  The only reason that it's not quite perfect is how quickly the holidays are approaching.

[03:56:00]  He is.  He is.  Listen.  Are you going there now?  I don't know.  I just like the fact that I know that it's in Philly.  Okay.  I've got to end the show now.  I could talk to both of you for a very long time, though.  Ditto.  I could talk to you forever with those Beats by Dre headphones.  I'm so glad.  I feel like we're flirting, and I don't mind.  Yeah.  I like it.  I like it.  Nicole, step outside for a while.  Why don't you just sit in this warm pool of a voice?  Yes.  I'm going to put on a hoodie footie, and you're going to zip it for me, okay?

No.  That's me.  Fuck you.  And fuck you, Nicole, for not liking Garth Brooks.
