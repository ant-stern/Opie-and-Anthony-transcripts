<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a conversation featuring comedian Joe DeRosa, who recounted humorous and vulgar anecdotes about his roommate, comedian Bill Burr, focusing primarily on their disputes over rent payments.  The hosts joined in, playfully mocking Burr.  The conversation then segued into reminiscences about a more crime-ridden New York City of the past, specifically discussing prostitution and the changes in Times Square.  A 911 call about a woman locked in her car was played, prompting further humorous commentary from the hosts.  UFC fighter Forrest Griffin then joined the show in studio.  Initially, the hosts commented on his intimidating appearance before the conversation shifted to Griffin's experiences in the UFC, fan interactions, and a video game character he created.  The hosts continued their use of vulgar language and crude jokes throughout this segment.

The conversation with Forrest Griffin continued, focusing on his book, *Godfights*, his fighting style, and humorous anecdotes from his fighting career.  He discussed his unusual path to becoming a professional fighter and his self-deprecating humor was a prominent feature.  Topics ranged from his preferences in video games (simpler games over complex ones) and his dislike of *Lost* after the Air France flight disappearance to his views on other UFC fighters (Chuck Liddell, Quinton "Rampage" Jackson, Fedor Emelianenko), and even his experiences skydiving.  A caller brought up Griffinâ€™s unusual book cover photo with a rifle leading to more off-color jokes.  The discussion then delved into highly personal aspects of Griffin's life, including his single testicle, various sexual practices, and his thoughts on getting punched in the face. A disturbing audio clip of bestiality was played, causing Griffin to express discomfort.  The segment concluded with a graphic discussion about a woman who received a face transplant after being shot by her husband, with the hosts and Griffin reacting with graphic descriptions and reactions to images.

The discussion of the face transplant recipient continued, with the hosts and callers using crude and offensive language to describe her appearance, comparing her to various cartoon characters and inanimate objects.  A caller, Maria, admitted to laughing at the news report.  Jesse Ventura then joined the show. The conversation shifted to Ventura's political views, his life in Mexico (contrasting it with life in the US, focusing on taxes and government corruption), his opinions on 9/11 (touching upon conspiracy theories and the use of torture), and his support for marijuana legalization. The segment concluded with further humorous, and offensive descriptions of the face transplant recipient's appearance.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a discussion of the 9/11 attacks, exploring various conspiracy theories and alleged inconsistencies in the official narrative. This discussion included the lack of air defense response, the handling of information before and during the attacks, and the profiles of the hijackers.  Jesse Ventura, still on the show, participated extensively in this discussion.  The segment then shifted to a humorous review of outtakes from the hosts' former television show, "Real Rock TV," showcasing their inappropriate on-camera behavior. Jimmy, a member of the show's team, was involved, reacting to the clips.  Jimmy then recounted sexually explicit and disturbing childhood experiences, including forced oral sex at a location he called "Devil's Creek."  The hosts attempted to locate this area using Google Maps.

The show continued with Jimmy Norton's detailed reminiscences of "Devil's Creek," using Google Maps to attempt to locate the area.  A caller, Lydia, shared her own explicit experiences with Jimmy at Devil's Creek, detailing sexual encounters involving herself and other children.  The conversation then focused on the death of a man who fell into a vat of melted chocolate at work, with darkly comedic speculation and offensive jokes about the incident.  Finally, the show focused on Intern David ("Executive Intern"), discussing his perceived laziness, punctuality, and interactions with other staff members.  The discussion included impersonations of other staff members and revealed internal conflicts within the staff.  The show included jokes and banter between the hosts and David.

The final segment discussed the intern, David, focusing on his perceived lack of initiative and responsibility, using humorous anecdotes and comparing him to David Brent from *The Office*.  This segment transitioned into a news story about Henry Earl, a Kentucky man arrested over 1000 times for public intoxication. The hosts reacted with amusement to a montage of Earl's mugshots, and the segment continued with frequent interruptions, off-topic tangents, and ribald jokes, using highly offensive language throughout.  No additional guests besides the regular hosts and David were in the studio during this final segment.

Billy eats one of the cookies and goes, you have to get that out of here or I'll eat the whole thing.  And like literally did like that female wave like, oh, get it away.  Get it away.  Yeah.  It would have really irritated you. 
[00:03:00]  There's something else going on with that story though, Vinny.  How needy is he, Jimmy?  Bringing in baked goods from home so you guys become friends with him or something?  No, no, no.  They were from the club.  They were from the dessert menu.  That fucking chesler.  They probably couldn't sell him anymore for health code reasons.  He knew they were going to be in the dumpster in 20 minutes figuring what the hell.  I'll look like a good guy.  Collecting them off of other people's tables.  Yeah.  They had like fucking the pubic hair of the cook and a few other people.  Fucking crazy jet bucket.  Get him on the phone so we can yell at him.  All he does is he's just nice to us and we just trash him. 
[00:03:30]  The, uh, well, I, you know, I get it.  We all get it.  I'm not going to jump in on the trashing because I need co-headliner gigs.  Vinny's a good shit.  Yeah.  No, uh, Bill Burr decided not to show up because you're here.  What's going on with you two?  He's, uh...  There's a little, uh, riff.  Is he worried?  He's sleeping in my bed right now.  Is he really?  Yeah, he's in my bed.  Right where you left him.  Yeah.  Right where I left him.  I painted one on his chin and said, I'm going to work, sweetheart. 
[00:04:00]  You fucking wait here and have some eggs ready when I get home.  Charlie, they're going to know what we were doing.  I can't sit.  Bill comes in.  He's got a fucking prop up on his right side.  I don't know what happened.  Yeah, when he called Steve, he was like, oh, excuse me.  I had something in my throat.  I don't feel too good today.  He was, uh, he was bitching because you came home late the other night and he was trying  to get some sleep to do our show.  And he goes, and then Joe comes in and he's, he's breathing heavy and fucking watching TV  while I'm trying to sleep. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  He complained to me.  Yeah.  Now, now I live in his apartment.  He owns the apartment, but I, I rent it.  It's my place.  But it's officially yours now because you're paying the rent and he's in LA and he's not  coming back anytime soon.  Yeah.  But yesterday he's over with, uh, with Bobby Kelly.  Yeah.  And we're talking and I go, and he goes, ah, yeah, you know, you're doing that all night  last night.  It just drives me fucking crazy.  Just every five minutes, eh, eh.  And then like ten minutes later, I do it again, and he looks at me, and he's like, you know, 
[00:05:00]  he makes that face, that squinty skull face that he makes.  That's fantastic.  You look and sound like him.  And I go, dude, get fucking used to it, all right?  You're here for three days.  I'm going to be clearing my throat.  He's the only guy that can make you feel nervous about clearing your throat.  You know what I'm saying?  I tried to give him rent one time early, and he yelled at me.  We got into a fight.  We were doing Uninformed.  We got into a fight on the air.  Danny, remember this?  Yes, I do.  I tried to give him two months rent, you know, once. 
[00:05:30]  And he goes, you know, I don't want fucking two months rent.  Give it to me one month at a fucking time.  And he starts yelling at me.  I go, you're the only guy that could get mad because I'm paying you early.  What was his point?  I don't know.  You still don't know his point?  I still don't know what his point was.  That would be the first thing I'd ask is, what's your fucking point?  I think he was saying that he didn't want the money in his hands early because he'd spend it or something like that.  I don't know that.  Cookies or he'll eat them?  How about Bill has a fucking ounce of stick-to-itiveness?  You got to get your girlfriend out of here.  I might rape her with a hammer. 
[00:06:00]  I bet it's a commitment thing.  Like, if you give him two months, he can't kick you out after a month if there's a problem.  He's never going to kick me out.  He is.  He needs the money.  I almost moved out once and he was, like, clawing to keep me in there.  Really?  Because I'm such a good tenant.  You pay your rent early?  Yeah.  Piss him off?  Paying rent early.  I let him come in and get sick in my goddamn bed.  You feed him jizz?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  So what does he got? 
[00:06:30]  The flu or something?  I don't know.  He woke up and he was like, he's like, I don't feel good.  And I was like, but it's hard to tell it, Bill.  It's like, you always make a face like you have the flu.  Yeah, he's just squinty.  I don't.  I don't.  Dude.  You always know he's about.  Thanks.  Is that kidding?  I texted Kenny for a mucinex.  These kill your throat.  Oh, can I have one?  Sure.  Thank you.  Do they make you drowsy now?  Yeah.  Very.  Yeah, they knock you right out.  That's why I'm going to take one.  It's fucking.  8-15.  What a clock. 
[00:07:00]  8-15, whatever.  I look for a clock and there wasn't one.  Thank you.  Like, Bill will say something like, you know, I don't feel good.  When you wake up, no one feels good waking up at that hour.  To come in here and do this fucking show, every morning, when that alarm goes off, I don't feel good.  I could legitimately call in and say, I don't feel good.  And not feel guilty about it.  Because I don't feel good.  Right.  Yeah.  Until, like, I think until I hit the tunnel.  No, when I hit, like, the tunnel, I'm like, all right, now at least I'm committed. 
[00:07:30]  I'm in Manhattan.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  But before that, no.  I'm exhausted.  I don't feel good.  I was probably drinking.  It was a good bet.  That's, like, I was thinking about that when I was walking over today.  When it's nice weather, getting up that early, it doesn't feel that bad.  You're like, oh, it's a nice morning.  I'm up.  I'm awake.  A little fresh air.  The last time I was in was the day of that blizzard and waking up.  Oh, yeah.  And it was the first time I had to be in at 6.  And it was, like, walking out of my place at 5.30. 
[00:08:00]  It was dark.  It's nighttime.  And it was snowing.  It was like, oh, this is rough, man.  It sucks.  This is really rough.  No one's up yet.  No.  In Manhattan, of all places, no one's up yet.  No.  It's crazy.  People are still going home.  We've talked about that a few times.  People are leaving the bars.  When we would come in a little earlier than we do these days, yeah, people would just  be coming home from bars and you'd see them stumbling down the streets.  I miss living on a side street because I would, you know, the cars would be all fogged up.  I'd call three or four. 
[00:08:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, people fucking in the cars?  Oh, yeah.  All fogged up with some great, like, music just pumping through the system.  Isn't that great?  And then you get the Walk of Shame women.  Yeah, I've seen a few of them.  I still see a few of them right when I get out of the tunnel.  You look at them like they're easy prey.  What are they thinking?  They're not walking straight.  They're on heels.  Ripped fishnets.  Right.  Little short skirt.  It's safe.  They got clothes in their arms.  Right.  It's fucking fantastic.  They look like a maid going to do laundry. 
[00:09:00]  It's safe anymore, man.  It's like, you know, I was on Red Eye a couple weeks ago and they were talking about that sting  they did.  They were doing, like, some sting in the adult video stores where cops were going in and  posing as gay guys.  Yep.  Oh.  You know, that whole thing.  Sexy.  But it was like entrapment, the way they were arresting these gay guys.  Hanging their dicks out.  Yeah.  What were the cops doing that was entrapment?  They were like, they were like...  Who were the lucky cops that got that guy?  Yeah, I know.  What did they do wrong?  That's why I left the force. 
[00:09:30]  All right, Kenny, you're going to be the mouth.  You're a mouth today.  They were doing this thing.  They were, like, picking up guys in the store and they'd be like, hey, and they'd strike  up the conversation and they'd be like, hey, let's go back to my place and hang out.  And the gay guy would be like, okay.  And then under his breath, the cop would be like, for a hundred bucks.  Like that, you know?  Oh, shit.  And then they'd arrest the guy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So, but everybody...  Well, that's really fucking kind of smart.  Not right?  Yeah, it's shitty.  Yeah, it is.  It's, you know, but everybody was up in arms about it and it's like, yeah, there should 
[00:10:00]  be hookers.  Like, I can't even find a hooker on the street anymore.  When I moved here five, six years ago, there was hookers and there was shady shit going on  and there was creepy people, at least a little bit still.  There's fucking nothing anymore.  Hell's Kitchen used to be riddled.  The cars used to drive around with...  Hookers.  Oh, I remember that.  All the hookers.  I haven't seen that in years.  They would hand out...  We did something on that at N.E.W.  They'd hand out those cars. 
[00:10:30]  They would put the cars on your car on the side streets.  And it was basically a limo where hookers just, you know, rode around it.  And people...  Yeah.  People...  You'd jump in the back, get, you know, get blown or whatever, and then they'd drop you  off.  Yeah.  At the red light.  People want the streets cleaned up.  They're like, we want hookers off the streets.  Then the hookers, like Joe said, would start driving.  And then they stopped driving and you get them on Craigslist and now they're fucking targeting  Craigslist.  It's like, all you're going to do is put them right back on the streets.  It's like, we think people are not going to fucking get blown for money?  Of course they are.  So it's like... 
[00:11:00]  It's been happening for a few years.  Yeah.  Leave them alone.  Let them work on Craigslist.  Arr, here's a doubloon for a blowjob.  You know, blowjobs through history.  Yeah.  Paid for.  Yeah.  Hookers through history.  Can't even get a decent Asian rub down anymore because now they have to make it look like  it's a legitimate massage parlor.  Yeah.  Or whatever a legitimate one is called.  Then they go in, they're wearing turtlenecks and khakis.  They're giving you a hand job like they just came from the Gap.  You're like, oh, for God's sake, man. 
[00:11:30]  Jesus.  They used to wear nighties and shit.  Yeah.  You missed the skank, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The city used to be a real, like, weird, creepy place.  I remember when I was a kid coming into the city was like this, it was a big deal.  Like, because it was so just seedy and scary to be here.  And we'd go on field trips, you know, take the bus from Long Island to the Museum of Natural  History or some shit like that.  And they would be like, okay, go directly from the bus to the stairs, stop on the stairs. 
[00:12:00]  It was like a whole drill because the whole city was like a piece of shit.  It was exciting, though.  It was full of crime and predators.  You walked to Times Square back then, right?  It was just filthy.  Like, everything had bus exhaust on it.  Like, the buses now, you see the buses go around.  It's a clean air bus.  A bus takes off from a light.  You forget the old days.  A bus takes off from a light now.  It's just the bus going.  It used to be, bam, bam, and there's a puff of black smoke everywhere. 
[00:12:30]  It used to be like a Little Rascals movie.  Yeah.  Like when the stove blows up.  It would just be like covered in soot.  The whole city had like a grit all over it.  It was fucking bus fumes everywhere.  It was beautiful.  Not anymore.  It was all clean.  Everything shiny and lit up all nice.  You never went into Times Square in the 80s, right?  No chock full of nuts stores anymore.  Actually.  Times Square in the 80s?  I was a kid, but my aunt used to, we used to, I had a great aunt that lived in the Bronx.  She was all right.  And we.  Very overrated.  Good fuck, but. 
[00:13:00]  We'd drive through Times Square to get there, coming out of the tunnel, and it was, I remember  just being like, holy shit.  Even as a kid, like, look at all the, I knew what hookers were and shit, you know?  Yeah.  Oh, and they dressed the part.  Yeah.  And now, you know.  They had no problems, you know, telling the world they were a hooker.  It was just a fascinating thing as a kid, the first time you came in, because I remember  looking out the school bus windows, you're just looking up at the buildings and all the  fucking riffraff and homeless on the street.  It was just like culture shock. 
[00:13:30]  It was, it was, they're trying to give you like this museum of natural history, little  tour, and the bus ride in was more information than you needed as a child.  They should have blacked those fucking windows out until you got there, blindfolded the kids.  All right, we're at the Midtown Tunnel.  Well, blindfolded the kids until we get to the fucking museum.  Because you'd look out the windows and just be like, what's that?  All right, don't look at it.  Holy shit.  And the, and the field trip moms that would be along and the teacher are just talking  like, oh fuck, look at that whore. 
[00:14:00]  They should have, yeah.  They should have blindfolded, like you're going to interview a warlord for 60 minutes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  Just, they take it off when you're in front of those big mastodons in the museum and then  go on your way, because it was just the shit you would see as a kid was pretty  frightening.  It was fantastic.  Amazing too, like how many, like everybody, I'm not, you know, I moved here five or six  years ago, so I'm not old school New York, but I'm amazed that all, everybody from old  school New York misses, like I did a private gig last night that was literally like, looked 
[00:14:30]  like trading places.  Remember, you know what I mean?  Like when they have that board meeting at the beginning, it was like, they were, they  were so rich and it was such old money.  And I was sitting at dinner after the gig talking to this French guy, who's like a  wine guy, just, you know, totally suit, all decked out.  And he was going off at dinner about the lack of hookers.  He's going, I'm in 1983.  I saw, but she was so beautiful.  I had to fuck her.  I had to fuck her. 
[00:15:00]  I didn't care.  And I was like, Jesus Christ.  Like I thought I was going to be the dirt ball at the table.  And this guy was just out doing me.  And I was like, I guess everybody misses the smut of New York City.  The smut was a really, it was such a big part of the city.  Like all the jokes, Johnny Carson telling the jokes about New York City.  And it was always about the hookers and the filth and the crime and the muggings in Central  Park.  Like Central Park was known as walk around there.  You'd be mugged.  That was where you went to get mugged.  That was the wilderness.  Central Park.  It wasn't a park. 
[00:15:30]  And obviously there's places that you wouldn't go in the park.  Especially at night.  But, you know, it's become a park.  People go there and fucking, you know, girls are half dressed on nice days out sunning.  They'd be getting fucking gang banged by a pack of fucking thugs a few years back.  Do you think with the economy, you know, I mean, New York.  Yes, it's going to turn right back into that.  It's already starting.  Oh, you think it will?  It's already starting.  Because I thought my theory was they were going to really pounce and try to shove all 
[00:16:00]  middle to lower class elements out of the city and create this completely white bread  upper class, you know, culture here.  And just keep raising the prices and just pay the price.  They're taxing the fuck out of the upper class.  So making it tough for them to stay.  They're making it tough for them to stay.  Why would you stay if you go somewhere else and get a hell of a lot more for your money?  You got the lower end jobs when when everyone was working, you had those lower end jobs that  kind of kept people.  It was like, all right, as long as I have a job, I won't stick a gun in this fucker's 
[00:16:30]  face, you know, and then those lower end jobs, because the guy a little further up on the  ladder lost his job.  He takes the lower end job and the other guy is now out on the street fucking you over.  I just love anarchy for some reason.  I really like that whole thing.  As a kid, I was petrified of the whole thing.  I used to cry like a motherfucker about everything.  I've told that a thousand times.  But there was if you remember, it was something in New York. 
[00:17:00]  It was called the Million Dollar Movie.  And the beginning of it, they would play the theme song to Gone with the Wind and they would  show scenes of the city at night and it would scare the piss out of me to watch this because  I used to imagine what it would be like to get lost, to be lost in the city.  And I would just start crying.  Ew.  I would be so scared that I would start fucking physically just crying and be upset.  What happened to you?  A little scaredy cat and now you're fucking a gun nut. 
[00:17:30]  Let's see.  I have guns so I don't cry.  All right.  I cry when I don't have my guns.  Fair enough.  Well, look at like the Warriors.  Like in that movie, every borough is bad.  Bad, yeah, yeah.  There's a gang running every section of the city.  Yes.  And one on roller skates and Yankee uniforms.  That was very believable.  All right.  That was a bit of a stretch.  Roof.  Puts of black guys with hockey sticks. 
[00:18:00]  One sport they don't dominate.  Where the orphans?  All right.  Yeah.  Orphans.  It's an apocalyptic city where all the gangs dress like they're on Broadway.  These guys wear top hats.  That would be a good one, right?  The Midtown Gang.  Ta-ta.  Yeah.  The Firesteams.  You see the Obamas visited the Queen, Joe?  Yes.  Very exciting.  We're all excited that they're over there. 
[00:18:30]  I don't know why.  That name sounds like royalty.  And the Obamas gave her an iPod filled with Broadway tunes and videos.  It's got all kinds of great stuff.  I was saying they should have just slipped in like Two Girls, One Cup or fucking Tub Girl.  A nice fisting video.  A fisting video.  Or Revolutionary War fucking movies.  Thanks for nothing, you old cunt.  I'm sure you remember this, but Mel Gibson's the Patriot. 
[00:19:00]  It starts off.  And the card they gave, it was inappropriate.  It was, I hope you enjoy the music, you colonizing old whore.  Where do you find a colonizing old whore card?  Very difficult.  You have to make one.  Fucking good comeback, Jim.  Fucking faggot.  You have to draw one.  Boo.  A boo.  So they just gave her an iPod or like at least an iTouch?  Hey, man, she gave them an autographed photo, so.  Oh, a photo of her.  Yeah, of her. 
[00:19:30]  Autographed.  Oh, and Philip.  Her and Prince Philip.  Oh, that useless fucking cuckold.  Dude, he's probably been tired of fucking her since 1963.  Oh, forget about it.  What the fuck did I get myself into?  He's thinking about that.  Yeah, he couldn't enjoy it.  How old is she?  She is fucking old.  She's got to be 80.  That's it?  Perhaps more than that.  She's older than that, right?  I don't know.  She took over pretty young, though.  She was a young little fucking queen.  Yeah, because her mom was alive until recently.  The mom made 100, right?  The mum?  The mum, that's right.  The mum.  The mum.  The queen mum. 
[00:20:00]  The 101, I think she made.  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  So she's got to be 80, 80, early 80s, I would guess.  Fucking limeys.  Yeah.  Prince Charles.  Spinal Town.  That's my favorite line in the movie.  It's the best line.  When they fucking put the partition up when he's talking about his book.  It's Bruno Kirby.  And he's driving the limo and he's talking to the guys.  Hey, you ever read this book by Sammy Davis Jr.?  And he's talking about Frank Sinatra.  You know, we're like Frank Sinatra.  And they just look and put the partition up in the middle of talking. 
[00:20:30]  And he just goes, fucking limeys.  That's the best line in the movie, you're right.  Whatever happened to Kirby?  They don't understand.  He's dead.  He's dead.  Bruno died?  Did he die?  Yeah, yeah.  You're kidding.  Yeah, he died like two years ago.  Yeah, pretty recently.  Why are we acting like that's a preposterous thing that has changed everything?  Fuck him.  Wasn't that old.  He was pretty young, though.  I mean, he was only in his 50s.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  Wow.  And he played young Clemenza, who was in the tech on the show. 
[00:21:00]  He's a funny dude.  He was great.  Did you ever see the Larry Sanders?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Where he was on?  I was in The Godfather.  Come on, man.  No, you weren't.  No, you weren't.  It's a fucking great episode.  I was Clemenza.  Yeah, right.  What happened?  What?  What happened?  The leukemia got him?  Oh, leukemia.  Jesus.  Poor Bruno Kirby.  That's sad.  That's a fun next to the last show here.  Nah.  Fuck him.  What's wrong with us? 
[00:21:30]  Oh, whatever.  I know, but we're just getting too sensitive.  Bruno Kirby died.  Rest his soul.  God love him.  I was a little bummed.  I was watching an Albert Brooks movie the other day that he was in.  I kind of got a little sad thinking that the guy's dead.  He's dead.  You know, what are you going to do?  He was good.  We'll bring everyone back up.  We got a great 911 call.  I had a very funny story.  These are good.  Is it the same one?  What?  What do you got?  Door-to-door salesman raped woman 78 on fire. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  This guy was a problem.  Wait a minute.  Wow.  Yeah, this guy.  Talk about you're in big trouble.  He's going to be in Dutch.  A Chicago man selling magazines door-to-door has been accused of raping a 78-year-old Dallas  area woman and setting her on fire.  It wasn't good enough that he had raped her.  He had an album set her on fire.  When you set someone on fire, you really are angry.  But it's not even surprising because I think he was selling Rape and Burn the Elderly Monthly. 
[00:22:30]  It's not a real magazine.  After he raped her when she was crying, was he like, that was the good news.  And then she realized it was really Ed McMahon from Publishers.  And she had won skin grafts.  That's right, lady.  It's all downhill from here.  The victim was assaulted Monday at her home, doused with rubbing alcohol. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.  I thought, like, what?  Am I hearing shit?  Oh, wow.  That's pretty much like a childhood.  What was her name?  Marvin Nash?  Oh, hi, Bill.  Oh, welcome.  Hey, here he is.  Hey, Bill.  You feel okay?  You under the weather?  Yeah.  You sick?  You all right?  Yeah, no.  We were just having a good time here with Joe.  Yeah, Joe.  I'm sure you were.  The new young superstar. 
[00:23:30]  Who I get in the show, and then the second I'm not here, you start talking shit about me, Joe.  Is that what happened?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  You half a fag.  Someone was listening.  Biting the hand that feeds.  Where were you listening?  Shut your face.  I got ears all over this fucking city.  Oh, some asshole called him up.  My flip phone was blowing up.  No, I literally just walked in, and that dude Joe said something like that.  Somebody said something like that.  They were like, what are you?  Are you ears ringing?  Joe's bread-mouthing you.  No, we got to ask you, Bill. 
[00:24:00]  He was trying to pay you two months' rent, and you would not accept that, and that caused  a major problem.  Yeah.  We just want to know why you wouldn't accept two months' rent from Joe DeRosa.  He was trying to pay ahead of me.  I know you don't believe that in your heart of hearts.  I know you don't believe that.  You just know this is going to be a good radio moment.  I kind of believe it.  I'm not buying it for a second.  What?  So how it works in a court of law is what you do is you hear one guy's story, and then  you hear the other guy's story.  You just don't hear one story and then be like, well, that happened.  Fair enough.  Why the fuck would you do that? 
[00:24:30]  Fair enough.  What is your side of this story?  My side of the story is he lives in a fucking unbelievable...  It was that Joe owned him for three months.  Owned me for three months?  He's so fucking irresponsible.  When is rent due?  It's due on the first.  But fucking big baby over here can't pay until the 15th.  He can't.  I don't have any gigs.  So I let you pay on the 15th.  That's the deal he said.  And you're irresponsible guy.  He's a fucking irresponsible.  He's one of these guys, right?  It's just like, just pay on the first.  He can't do it.  He's got to pay on the 15th. 
[00:25:00]  Then listen, I'm going to pay you for 1.6 months because I get the money.  He's like a fucking junkie.  He's pulling his money out of his pockets.  There's like peanut shells on it.  He's a mess.  What was wrong with Joe?  The story's a little different than the one you told.  It's due on the 15th.  Just fucking pay me on the 15th.  Don't switch it all up.  Then you were there.  Did I not offer the man two months rent and that's what the fight was about?  It was two months?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, I mean, maybe I might be a little fuzzy on the way I remember.  Ah, look at that.  He's a hospital witness now for you.  Exactly, Joe.  Do you think he gives a fuck about our life?  You had this little joke. 
[00:25:30]  You had to come in here and drag that shit out.  Is that what's going on?  You could be a little happy, half an Egyptian bullshit.  Did you do that?  Did you get your fucking Sukkrat so you're feeling better now?  You're not opening for me.  You're off the fucking gig.  Wow.  Jesus, Burr.  I'm pissing vinegar, Burr.  No, because I'm actually pissed at my dad right now.  Why?  Because he's supposed to be Dr. Feelgood.  He's supposed to give me my shit, right?  He gives me these pills, man.  You literally got to eat like a short stack of pancakes.  If you don't, before you take these pills, you'll be hurling across the fucking room. 
[00:26:00]  I called him at 730.  Yeah, the place opens at 8.  He goes, yeah, yeah, I'll get right on it.  He wasn't on it.  He's getting it.  What's he do?  Is your father the pharmacist?  He said, drop dealing.  There's a chick bringing something in a plastic bag shoved in her vagina.  What pills are you going for to knock this out of you?  This stuff, erythromycin.  Oh, yeah.  What's that do?  I don't know.  It just, and whatever bacteria you got, anything.  I'm trying to say throat, because I'm trying to have to lob one over the net for you, Jim. 
[00:26:30]  You just got the...  You just get the, you know, those, you know, you're just waking up going, oh, you know what?  I'm going to...  I'm going to be sick today.  Yeah, you start feeling like you're kicking heroin.  You know, you feel that when you're waking up.  One of those deals.  Yeah, a little shaky.  I got to fly to Chicago.  I got to do that gig.  Then I got to fucking hold up stupid Saturday night.  Make up for the mess that he does in front of me.  Jesus Christ.  Why are you coming at me so hard right now?  Wow, man.  Joe, do you have that kind of a memory?  That is...  You knew I was sick. 
[00:27:00]  You knew I just wanted to come in here, because I appreciate the fellas letting me come in all week,  making an appearance.  And what do you do?  The second my back is turned, you stick a knife right in it.  Exactly.  What else fits survival?  That's all it is.  Well, then don't act surprised when I come at you a little tough, all right?  Are you mad that you finally had it because he's been clearing his throat for the last three days?  Oh, dude, he's like a fucking...  Joe is the funniest.  He's not even an old soul.  He really is an old man.  He comes in off the road. 
[00:27:30]  This is how fucking bad this kid eats, so I can't even get mad when he's clearing his throat.  He fucking comes home.  What are you on the road?  For like six days?  He comes stumbling in, right?  He's like, ah, God, I'm hungry.  I got to get something to eat, right?  And he opens the refrigerator.  He pulls out a bag that says Dunkin' Donuts on the side of it.  He fucking opens it up like Oscar Madison.  Pulls out this fucking donut you could have used as a doorstop.  He's like, eh, you think this is going to be okay?  I just started laughing. 
[00:28:00]  He eats like that.  He smokes.  He drinks.  So then at nighttime, he can't go to sleep.  But I swear to God, literally, like every six minutes, right as I start to nod off, he just  hears.  Dude, it's so...  I don't even get mad.  It's so annoying.  I just start laughing.  Like, I'm just sitting there.  It's kind of like, you know, when your grandfather's like annoying, but you know he's going to die  soon, so you don't get mad at him.  You're just like, ah.  Holy shit.  Oh, that's funny.  He's had a great life. 
[00:28:30]  I thought of you when I was in Montreal, because I was sitting at lunch one day by myself, and  I was eating...  And you were lonely?  I was eating a hot dog and a hamburger and a Coke.  And that was my lunch.  Like, I was a six-year-old at a birthday party.  And I had all my fixings.  You ever go to like a gas station, and you see those hot dogs spinning around?  You're like, who the fuck would ever eat those?  Joe DeRosa.  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  Oh, fuck.  I love it.  Iron stomach DeRosa.  Yeah, I love it.  Those things are disgusting.  They're on those metal, friggin' hot metal tubes, just rotating all day long. 
[00:29:00]  I was clearing my throat a lot when I was in Iraq with Kong, because I do that, too.  And he goes, what are you, brush your teeth with, buttermilk?  We got a Ron and Fez spy report coming in.  Spy report.  Jim in Staten Island.  Jim?  Yeah, we are.  All right, man.  Hey, Brian, let me ask you a question.  Okay.  You watched Sonny Fox this morning?  Did I watch what?  No, were you on Sonny Fox this morning?  No, I wasn't. 
[00:29:30]  No, I wasn't.  That's not what I heard.  I heard you on there.  He's trying to say...  I heard you on there.  You a lying suck of shit?  Are you lying?  I lie.  I lie.  Are you lying?  This is the worst bad cop I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah.  He's trying to say you're on another radio show, Bill, and that's why.  Bill can do whatever he wants.  Maybe I was.  Maybe I was.  What are you going to do about it on your phone?  You motherfucker, I'll be right there, you cock-sucking-lite, suck-a-shit. 
[00:30:00]  Like a sick-a-shit?  All right.  I'm fucking a fuck, you fucking moron.  All right.  All right, all right.  Wow, you know all the dirty words.  That's angry.  Where were we?  Yeah.  You gamble when you play the casinos?  No, I try to stay.  This time I will, because we're going to be down there for the whole night, so we'll probably  shoot a little crap.  Yeah.  Me and Joe's, it's not a good, it's not a functional thing here.  No.  Neither one of us, you know the fucked up thing, because both of us know every decision  we're making is the wrong thing, but it's the inertia of both of our moron brains. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, it's not one, one won't hold the other one back.  Dude, I remember one night, we woke up, we were so fucking hungover, and I started getting  pissed at him, I was like, dude, I knew the second you walked into Caroline's, I was  like, ah, fuck, now I got to drink.  And I'm like, I didn't even want to drink.  And he goes, you know what's funny, dude?  I was thinking the same thing when I saw you, and we never addressed it.  And then we stayed in.  I don't want to drink.  Until four in the morning.  Doing what you didn't want to do.  Just pounding down whiskeys.  Thank God.  Like we're actually a success and we can do something like that? 
[00:31:00]  We drink after shows like we're Martin, Dean Martin Sinatra.  Like we've really, like we've really earned it.  Rather than we just did a college gig.  Hey, get Aunt Margaret and Judy Garland in here.  Come on.  We got to.  Where's Ava Gardner?  We, uh, thank God you have a girlfriend, because if you didn't, dude.  You'd be fucking him?  Oh my God almighty.  What?  No, it'd just be.  And then hookers would come into the mix, and it would just be a fucking mess.  No, they wouldn't.  I've never been able to. 
[00:31:30]  Really?  I can't.  I know.  I can't make the leap.  Oh, Bill.  I know.  I can't make the leap back.  And by saying you've never been able to, by saying you've never been able to, does  that mean you've purchased one, but wasn't able to, or you've just never?  I've, uh, I had one rubbed.  I had a girl rub one out one time.  Yeah?  I've told that story here.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was a riveting one.  See, I used to see your eyes just released.  I know.  It was like nine years ago.  I don't remember it either.  It's the 800th jerk-off story of the month. 
[00:32:00]  Right, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it's kind of a subject we cover a lot.  Do you remember?  I was supposed to do a spot, and she rubbed one out, and I was a free spot, and I just  sort of spunked all over my truck.  I dropped her off, and I went home, and I watched the Rangers win the Stanley Cup.  You don't remember that?  I swear to God, I don't remember.  Every time I see Marc Messier holding that cup going crazy, I think about that lovely woman  who rubbed one out.  Maybe you told that on the Sonny Fox show.  I like how it couldn't be a reputable morning program.  It just has to be some whatever. 
[00:32:30]  Where is he?  I have no idea.  I did his show a while ago.  He runs the Comedy Channel, and he was, I don't remember where he was based on.  I think he was based here out of New York.  Oh, he was a satellite guy.  Oh, I met him in D.C.  I don't remember.  Yeah, he's on telly.  I think he might have been the XM comedy guy.  He was.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, Sonny Fox.  Sure.  9-1-1 call.  This is a good one.  Oh, yeah.  I was thinking Sonny Joe White.  Yeah, I don't.  Yeah.  I didn't make a question.  Kiss 108?  Oh.  You know Sonny Fox?  They shot him at the causeway.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Sonny Corleone.  No, the guy down in D.C.  Oh, my God.  He's going to be pissed.  You know fucking Sonny Fox.  He fucking robbed the bank to get Leon Shermer a sex change.  Oh, no.  That's Sonny Wartik.  Sonny Wartik.  That's his name.  Wow, yeah.  Quick, any more Sonny references?  Is it Sonny Fox, the guy that skied into a tree and died?  No, Sonny Bono.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, was I talking to this about you guys?  Dog Day Afternoon.  And what's the name of the dude there who played Fredo?  John Cazale.  That guy, if you ever look at his IMDb.  That's not his name.  John Cazale? 
[00:33:30]  Is that his name?  No, I just made that up.  Fredo?  Yeah, he was also in The Deer Hunter.  He was also in My Old Streep.  Okay.  I'm saying, his IMDb guy died, like, right after, I think, that movie or whatever.  He has arguably the best IMDb you could possibly have.  He's in The Godfather 1, 2, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon, and The Deer Hunter.  And then he died.  And then he died.  Beat that.  Even De Niro's got, like, Analyze This.  De Niro's got some real shit.  And he's, uh... 
[00:34:00]  Analyze This.  The dude, Showtime, that Eddie Murphy movie he did.  15 minutes.  Yeah, but if...  88 minutes.  If De Niro died in 80, he'd have a comparable one.  I'm just saying.  Oh, yeah, yeah, true.  You know he's got a ton of shit?  Shit, uh, Pacino, dude.  Pacino's got stretches through his entire career.  Like, the 80s.  It's fucking awful, dude.  Arthur, Arthur.  That was a good one.  That was 79 before his voice changed.  That one was good.  Sea of Love was the first one where his voice was kind of, like, fucking... 
[00:34:30]  Sea of Love.  Getting that out.  Yeah.  Show me how you do it to her, Michael Rooker.  That's good.  Getting a fucking pillow.  The biggest bit of overacting he's ever done in his career...  People talk about now, like, the heat.  Like, you got your head up her ass!  Or whatever, all that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  The biggest bit of overacting he ever did is in Dog Day Afternoon,  when he walks up with that flower box,  and the way he pulls the shotgun out of the box...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He is jerking his body, like, going like this, 
[00:35:00]  like he's trying to rip through fucking steel.  It's a box.  It's a cardboard box.  And that's the beginning of it.  You're like, oh, there's the precursor to Scent of a Woman.  Ooh-ah!  Hey, you know that guy, Andrew McCarthy,  who was in Weekend at Bernie's?  Yeah, of course.  My whole family used to call him Eyes,  because he used to always do that thing where he'd open his eyes,  and I'm like, why the fuck is he doing that?  If you watch Dog Day Afternoon,  I think that's where he stole it from.  Pacino keeps having his eyes open. 
[00:35:30]  I'm dying here doing that voice like this one.  Like, you know...  My favorite was his fucking wife.  He goes, I can call the president.  Who do I have to call?  And then that fat cunt that's on the other end.  Is he going to shoot me, dump my body in the river,  and he's, Angie, would you shut the fuck up?  He hangs up on her.  It's funny, I think he would do that.  Shut the fuck up.  Hangs up on her.  Yeah, he had some real shit, though. 
[00:36:00]  And then that other one, Simone.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was a virtual reality woman.  I created Simone!  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Who was Simone again?  It was he created...  No, but who played the Simone character?  Some cunt.  It's some kind of sick joke for his entertainment.  Yeah.  Oh, that's my favorite.  Look, but don't touch!  But he goes, he's a sadist!  I'd just be looking at him like, what are you doing? 
[00:36:30]  You're way over the top here.  How about take it down a notch?  Can you imagine the awkward silence after those takes?  Everybody wanting to say, was that ridiculous?  But you're like, no, it's Pacino.  Pacino, it's so over the top.  Is it over the top or is it Pacino?  I haven't seen too many of the other ones,  but when he's interrogating that guy,  the guy won't give him what he wants,  and he's just banging on the table going,  come on!  Give me something!  Come on!  It's like... 
[00:37:00]  He didn't memorize his lines.  I'll just be loud.  Is that good?  That's a great scene.  Give me all you got!  Give me all you got!  I don't know if that's good.  I don't know if it's good acting.  I don't know if it is, yeah.  Is it?  Is he ahead of his time?  Or is he fucking a hack?  Or is he doing theater acting with a microphone?  Yeah, yeah.  I think fucking it worked in...  In the Devil's Abbey, it worked  because he was playing the devil,  but like in like...  Is the devil a loud fucking...  Yeah!  ...over-the-top guy?  I don't think he is.  Please.  He'd be a little more subdued. 
[00:37:30]  You think you're fucking subtle in hell?  You're yelling and screaming.  It's like he's been in battle with God pretty much,  and he's that passionate still?  Come on.  He'd be like, oh God.  He's a fire all around.  He's selling it pretty hard.  He's selling it like a college axe.  Yeah, yeah.  He's cartwheeling all over the place.  Jesus Christ.  Take it there, buddy.  Cartwheeling?  Is that Clarice Leachman?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's good old Clarice on TV.  She looks good for the fucking 80s, though, man.  Would you?  Would I fucking...  No, not after Mary Tyler Moore. 
[00:38:00]  I would have fucked her up to Mary Tyler Moore.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Bill, would you for the story?  She was never a looker.  I would for the story.  Ah, she can blow me.  Now?  Let her blow you?  That fucking old, bleeding, baby powder smell.  Take decades off for life.  I'd put my foot up on one arm of the chair and just kind of rubbed my balls on her lips  while I jerked off.  What?  You always have a unique way of putting these things.  I mean, that's what I would do.  You can't...  I wouldn't stay hard if I was in her mouth.  If I was just kind of looking down at the top of her forehead and that fucking hair,  she has like a Pacino wig on right now. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That is a wig.  Well, would you have to squeeze the face real hard to make it seem like you still got a  heart on?  Yeah, it would be like really soft, but it would be purple because I'd be squeezing  the face.  I'd kind of slap it against her cheek like a tiny plum.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, you want the 911 call?  Danny says this could be one of the best ever.  Wow.  Every 911 call is the best ever.  Yeah.  All right.  We got a lady who locked herself in her car. 
[00:39:00]  So you got to call 911, right?  Locked herself in her car?  Yeah.  How does that happen?  I don't know.  How do you lock yourself in your fucking car?  Probably automatic locks and something wasn't working.  There's all kinds of fucking redundancies.  Or maybe she was the lady that chimp attacked and she didn't realize she didn't have any  hands until she got to the mall.  That's true.  Or a face to see the door lock.  Just for your emergency.  Hi, I'm in a Walgreens parking lot and my car will not start. 
[00:39:30]  I'm locked inside my car.  I cannot open my car.  I can't get the windows down.  Nothing electric will work.  And it's getting very hot in here and I'm not feeling well.  Can't she...  Does the car...  Break a window or something or open?  AC?  She said it won't start.  Do you know who she sounds like, by the way?  Who?  The lady who wanted her Western burger.  The Western burger.  She does sound like her.  She sounds...  I want to know what kind of car she's got that completely, once the fucking electricity 
[00:40:00]  goes off, you can't fucking open the door.  It's a Sherman tank.  And the hatch is much too heavy.  It doesn't say.  There's...  Maybe she says, yeah.  I need some help.  Just...  Just...  Are you able to pull the lock up on the door and open the door?  You should be able to just pull the lock up even if it's electrical.  I've tried.  Okay. 
[00:40:30]  Okay.  All right.  I got that going.  Okay.  So, are you able to get out of the car now?  Yes.  I got the door open.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  All right.  I'll see if I can get AAA or something.  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  All right.  Bye-bye.  She hadn't...  Oh, my God.  You dumbass.  She didn't try the door?  Wow.  She didn't try the door lock.  Because I was saying, like, even the electric ones, they have the mechanical lock still.  They have to.  Yeah.  That is the ultimate panic.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  She's like, ah, I got to call 911.  I'm not feeling well.  It's getting hot in here.  The windows are up.  Yes.  I'm going to...  She's going to run out of air.  Oh.  Yeah.  The door lock.  The convertible top is stuck.  It's going to rain.  It's going to be hot.  The convertible's down.  If you work for 911, at least once a day, you should be allowed to go, you're a dumb snatch.  Yeah.  You should be allowed to say that once a fucking day.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sam and Iraq, as always. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  And, surprise, surprise, yet another UFC superstar in the studio.  That's true.  Ultimate Fighter Season 1 competitor, Forrest Griffin, who has now become sort of one of  the big stars in the UFC.  Stopped by the studio, former light heavyweight champion, to talk about what it's like being  a fighter.  He had a new book out.  It was a couple months before he fought Anderson Silva, so you can hear him talk before he got  the snot punched out of him.  He's a wonderful person.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said that.  Broke his jaw, I think, right?  Yeah, I shouldn't have said that.  On the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:42:00]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sam and Iraq.  This whole show is all about UFC now.  That's true.  Everybody's into the UFC.  Everybody loves the Ultimate Fighting Championship.  And people who weren't into it are now starting to learn and get into it, like myself.  So it's only fitting that we start having more and more UFC people show up.  This one is Forrest Griffin.  Forrest Griffin, stop by the studio.  One of my favorite things about Forrest Griffin's appearance is I was pre-interviewing him before  he came on.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And all of a sudden, that was the day that Steve wore his terrible capris. 
[00:42:30]  And while I was pre-interviewing, Steve goes to the computer, and without me even just  saying, Forrest, what do you think of those terrible pants?  He goes, dude, why are you wearing that?  And Steve says something like, well, they're shorts.  And he goes, no, I know what they are, but why would you put them on?  It was really funny.  Steve's gay.  Steve is.  That's true.  That's actually factual.  But Forrest Griffin stopped by, and even though he got knocked out by Anderson Silva recently,  he intimidated the hell out of all of us. 
[00:43:00]  And he's one of the better fighters that has come on our show.  No offense to anyone.  Please don't hurt me.  I'm the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're ready to be fucked, man.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Jesus Christ.  I hope this guy doesn't kill us.  Ladies and gentlemen, Forrest Griffin.  What's up, man?  What's up, Forrest?  How are you, brother?  I'm well.  Where are you?  Doing good.  We'll put you over there.  Let him get sitiated.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Good.  You look like you could be a problem. 
[00:43:30]  This house is a problem in general.  Doesn't mean a problem.  Look at this.  He's a scary fucking dude, man.  I'm not, though, right?  I look kind of normal looking, right?  You got those eyes.  Do I?  It's the eyes.  Yeah, you got those eyes.  I'm not going to fuck with you.  I know.  Can we get some headphones?  What the hell are those?  We get these baby headphones.  Nothing's going to fit on these ears.  Do I really need the headphones?  Are we taking calls or something?  We took calls.  We might.  We'll just talk to you guys.  We got a lot of...  You can tell me what people say.  We got a lot of Forrest Griffin fans. 
[00:44:00]  I might want to talk to you, Forrest.  I'm trying to listen to people anyway.  That's a pretty good road to take.  You don't like listening to people?  Who does, right?  This is...  I'm serious, right?  Yeah.  You could curse yourself.  Fuck, yeah.  Most of them are assholes, first of all, people.  What about your fans?  You don't like talking to them?  I mean, I do if they're genuinely fans.  I mean, most people are fans of the sport.  And they've got usually good, very helpful advice from me, which would be like when I 
[00:44:30]  gave KCK and the NASCAR driver advice about how to drive.  Very perfect.  Yeah.  Because I know a lot about fucking NASCAR.  I should give this guy advice.  So what is something a fan has said to you?  Drive.  Drive fast.  What has a fan said to you, like fighting-wise or whatever, that just made you want to smack  him, but you were kind of polite about?  Man, there's so many things.  I don't even know where to get started, you know?  People come up with, like, ludicrous things.  Like, you know, you should really make a better entrance. 
[00:45:00]  I don't like your entrance.  Your entrance?  What?  My entrance?  What's that got to do with anything?  That's asinine.  Shut up.  But people tell you, like, you know, the worst, though, seriously, is when, like, a 30-year-old  chick at Starbucks is like, yeah, you know, you should really keep your hands up and try  to move to your left more, like, away from their power.  And I'm like, bitch, you're dead on.  How do you know this?  What are you talking about?  You should have taken her advice and fucking punched her in the face.  I was like, what?  And then stepped to the left and I was like, bitch, I'm going to move out of your power. 
[00:45:30]  Get sold.  The only fight I've ever been to was you and Rampage.  That was the only actual UFC event.  Well, then you've done it.  It was great.  What else is there?  Great fucking fight.  It was an amazing fight.  Yeah, he took the belt from Rampage.  I saw it on TV, you know.  What's this button do?  Is that really, it's got, like, a safety message or something?  I didn't even know.  This morning, I said, what is that?  What is that, Danny?  Do we know?  Yeah, it's, well, you know how, uh, we're directly connected to ComStack.  It's kind of in DC, basically.  That button runs right to DC and if we press it, we go to commercial break. 
[00:46:00]  What?  It's a backup for the one that Travis has.  Is that if a guest is panicking, he could just go to commercial break?  You know what?  They did it so that these studios could be used independently of one another.  Oh, good.  Goody, goody gumdrop.  But it needs all that protection.  And Forrest is right.  Why can't we just have a button?  Because that's the button.  It looks like it's fucking.  That's like the president's football.  Yeah, it looks like it's going to set up some, set off some fucking missiles or something.  I beat the shit out of you.  Yeah.  Don't say this.  I beat the shit out of you. 
[00:46:30]  With whom?  UFC.  The game.  Well, I mean, what character beat me up?  My own guy, Chopmeat.  Oh, you.  Yeah, he's Chopmeat.  I built up a character named Chopmeat and he's been kicking ass.  My character is Forrest Glassjaw Griffin.  And I've got to be honest, he's not doing so well.  Turns out Forrest sucks at video games.  Are you really playing the game?  Yeah, I'm horrible.  You know, they gave me, like, the game and stuff.  And they were like, yeah, here's how you play it.  And I was like, oh, here's how retards play it. 
[00:47:00]  It's a great game, man.  It's a lot of fun.  I'm sure retards can play the game.  Dana White was in here showing off the game.  And we all are just, and more than most, are just hooked on this thing.  I love it, man.  It's hysterical.  It's a great, great video game.  Just go in there and start kicking people in the side of the head and the body.  You see, here's the deal, man.  I tuned out on games when they had, like, two buttons, right?  Really?  Pong?  It was this and this.  Like, you know, the basic Mario Brothers, you know?  Yeah.  Side-scrolling.  I haven't been playing in 14 years, you know? 
[00:47:30]  Turns out I played sports.  I got laid.  I didn't fucking play video games.  All right, stop.  I had a life.  Stop pushing that on us.  I understand.  Taking other people's girlfriends and punching the guys in the face.  You know what, though?  He's right.  Too many buttons.  I'm with you.  I don't know how to figure out the combinations of shit.  No, no, no.  Head kick.  You've got to hold the top button.  And then press that.  Yeah.  Press that three times and then hit this one.  Kind of gets a little crazy.  I play the golf games because those are kind of easy.  But these fighting games, they're a tiger. 
[00:48:00]  It's more complicated than giving a chicken orgasm.  I've got to touch where and do what at the same time?  I'm not into playing a game you can do in real life.  Like golf, you could just go out and play fucking golf.  I can't go around and start blasting people on the streets.  And what's the move called when you just push all buttons and hope something happens?  Ass blaster.  No, I don't know.  What is it called?  Ass blaster.  It's button mashing.  That's where your character just shifts in the ring and the other fucking slips in it.  Oh, bam.  Goes down.  Twisted ankle over time. 
[00:48:30]  I have to, I have to, I'm one of those guys that have to stay up, though.  How do you?  Well, we're in trouble for us.  There's a plane missing?  Air France, yeah.  They're starting to say that it might have been hit by lightning, right?  Yeah.  Oh, that's horrible.  We lost this one.  This is not going to end good.  Who knows?  It might have been an antenna.  Maybe they just lost the antenna.  Wow.  Yeah, but it wouldn't be off radar then.  It's like you wouldn't, you have to, what is it, transponder?  They lost that transponder.  Yeah, but you wouldn't lose that and your communication.  They lost everything.  Yeah.  The plane.  For the people just tuning in, Air France, where, over the ocean?  Brazil to Paris, yeah.  Brazil to Paris.  Coast to Brazil.  Louis C.K. is being arrested. 
[00:49:00]  Looks like Woody Allen.  He does.  A little of both.  A lot of news happening.  I know, we just kind of.  That's the Twilight Zone.  Planes are disappearing?  What the hell?  Yeah, that was a Twilight Zone.  220 people aboard, something like that?  Yikes.  You know where they are, though.  They're on the Lost Island right now.  Ah.  Do you know what happened?  Are you a fan of Lost?  I am, actually.  Yeah, that was a good one.  8-15, baby.  It's kind of pissed when it ended.  Now I don't know what to do with Wednesday nights.  I should get out and get laid, I guess, and not play video games.  Don't.  Just play more time on the video games. 
[00:49:30]  I don't know.  I'm very addicted to that stupid fucking show.  The way they ended season five really disturbed me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was like a fucking housewife.  Don't know what to do.  Fanned myself.  Look at all.  Now what?  How long do I have to wait?  Oh, ten months?  This is great.  I don't have to wait, because I just got the box set.  I'm starting from the first episode.  That's what I do.  I'm way behind.  Stop bragging.  I just wait until the whole thing's over, and it's on DVD, and kill it in like a week.  Watch the whole thing, do a marathon.  Yeah.  That's what I do with The Wire.  We were just discussing The Wire.  Yeah, I did the same thing with The Wire. 
[00:50:00]  Yesterday.  The guys at Spike TV were like, you have to watch this.  And I was like, why?  They were like, well, this is what suburban white people think about urban black people.  It's a great portrayal of a bunch of white people talking about the ghettoes.  Yeah.  Do you know what?  Sounds very pertinent.  Right, what you just said is a guarantee why they never got an Emmy.  It's one of the best shows ever.  And I guarantee it was that attitude.  People thought, well, this is how white people feel about black people.  That was such a fucking realistic show.  There's no one from Baltimore that wouldn't tell you that's realistic.  No, no. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, no, it's true.  That's the way the drug trade is.  People are, baby.  And people fucking, they were like, they never got nominated for an Emmy, and that's why.  Because people were like, oh, that's white people's view of black people.  That was the way I've heard it is for my white friends.  Like I said, white people write the black people talk, obviously.  Yeah.  People want to talk to you, just like we thought there, Forrest.  We got Forrest Griffin in studio.  Tim, what's up?  You don't have to put him on.  Just put him in your ears.  Whatever you want to do.  Turn your radio down, dummy.  Hey, people fucking, they're doing it.  Oh, this guy is too. 
[00:51:00]  Hey, Tim, talk.  You're on the air with Forrest.  Right away, I know he's a fan.  He's like, I can't figure out a radio.  Turn your fucking radio off.  I had to hang up on him.  You had to.  He wasn't doing nothing.  Look, if you call the show, we're on a slight delay.  So if you hear someone go, hello, Tim, you're on the air, that means you have to talk now.  Don't talk to your radio.  We're talking about the book, God Fight?  What can you tell us about your book?  We haven't been, but I guess we are now.  Oh, let's talk about it.  There's something very funny, by the way.  And again, the inside cover, they have like a little synopsis of what the book's about. 
[00:51:30]  That's me trying to goad you into buying the book.  It worked.  I mean, it's phenomenal.  It also says, Forrest is, why should you buy this book instead of one by a lot of much higher caliber fighters?  Forrest is not as good looking as those guys.  He's not as smart as them, and he's not as athletically endowed.  And let's face it, neither are you.  And right now, he is blowing his nose really loud, which kind of reminds me of that.  And it said, but you can actually aspire to be like Forrest one day.  Why?  Because he is nothing special, just like you. 
[00:52:00]  It's kind of self-deprecating, which I like.  And not just me.  I'm deprecating everyone.  I'm deprecating all over the place.  So what is it?  Like, you say you're not a martial artist.  You're a fighter.  Like, what's the difference?  I don't wear pajamas and do cotters or something.  I'm not a fat middle-aged man that tells 12-year-old kids what to do.  I don't like kids.  Oh, damn.  That's fantastic.  I don't practice breathing.  I don't have a giant stomach and tell kids how to do it. 
[00:52:30]  You go in there and try to beat the shit out of somebody.  I never did karate or anything.  Maybe that's why I'm a cheetah's champ.  He fucking did karate.  What a jerk.  You just...  I played football, man.  I wasn't a loser.  But now, as far as fighting goes, you didn't...  Did you train as a boxer?  Was there anything?  Or did you just know how to...  I mean, I still don't know how to fight.  Originally, you just know how to fucking punch people real hard?  No, you see, here's the thing, man, and it's actually in the book.  I really was overly aggressive in athletics. 
[00:53:00]  Not mean, but like I'm an idiot and I'm kind of a klutz.  So I just ran into people playing basketball, playing football, playing whatever we happened  to be playing.  I always went like...  I tried to win.  The only way I knew how to win was hustle.  And apparently hustling and head-butting people are not mutually exclusive.  You do that a lot.  So I just run into people and they beat the shit out of me.  So I started fighting.  I was trying to play basketball, but a little too rough.  So I got beat up a lot.  So I ended up fighting. 
[00:53:30]  Because you had to.  Other people were beating you up.  So obviously you got it out of there.  Well, I was a kid that was going to elbow you in the head.  Oh, we got this rebound.  Oh.  It was like, we're playing on a concrete court and you're hard fouling people.  What the hell are you doing, Forrest?  You're an idiot.  So when did you realize, like, wow, I'm getting pretty good at beating people up.  I should go pro.  I don't know, man.  I was in, like, the college at UGA and I saw these guys beating each other up in this  room.  And I was like, man, I should do that.  That looks cool.  I could do that. 
[00:54:00]  Like, who looks at that?  I look at that and go, I don't want to be near that room.  It looks like it hurts.  I needed something to do.  And I was like, man, I bet I could do that.  You never watched the UFC and thought, oh, I could do that.  No.  No.  Anytime I see somebody actually laying there bleeding, I go, I could do that.  That I could do.  Not get up.  I saw the guy laying down unconscious, shaking.  I was like, worst case scenario, I can't be worse than that guy.  He's the cake there, man.  I could do better than that.  But, like, no, I look at things like that. 
[00:54:30]  Like, fighting looks like it hurts.  And the few I've been in, they do hurt.  Yeah.  Like, I don't like that punch to the head when everything goes.  Wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham.  And then you're just going, boy, if this guy knew, he could touch me.  People are talking to you and he's like, it's Charlie Brown's teacher.  You don't know what's going on.  Yeah, yeah.  Wham, wham, wham.  It's like one more punch and I'm out.  Well, it's, you know, my, you know, do you ever go on skydiving?  No.  All right.  You're standing on the plane.  I've been skydiving a couple of times. 
[00:55:00]  You're standing on the plane.  You're strapped to some dude.  Lucky me.  I got strapped to the dude that didn't talk and joke around.  Everybody else, you know, you have to jump tandem the first time anyway.  Everybody else joking.  I got the guy that looks like he's depressed today.  Maybe he's going to kill himself and take me with him.  You know, maybe he's going to fake an accident and, like, get some life insurance off me.  I'm like, oh, fuck this guy.  And, you know, they open the plane and you're thinking, what have I done?  How did I do this?  And the only reason why I was able to do it is because there's, like, 40-year-old housewives 
[00:55:30]  that are doing it for, like, their 40th birthday.  They really were on this little plane.  And they're just calm, cool, and laughing, like, oh, this is so fun.  And I was like, dude, I want to go first.  Let's go first.  Come on.  Let's just get it over with.  Yeah.  I'm going to die.  Let's just jump off the plane now.  I don't want to have to wait to die.  This is the worst part.  So you totally just wrote yourself off.  So I jump.  I do that every fight.  Once you hit the air, though, it's really freeing.  It's like, you know, he talks about in Fight Club. 
[00:56:00]  You're like, oh, you're free from everything.  You know, your problems.  Did you get your girlfriend pregnant?  You know?  Fucking, can you pay your mortgage?  You don't think about any of that.  You're free.  And you're plummeting.  Just for that, you know, 13 seconds.  Do they train you to not just fucking flail your feet and, like, try to gain ground,  which is instinctive?  Or do they tell you just put your arms out straight and fall?  All right.  They say arch.  And then they explain this arching process to you.  And apparently I was the best archer in the world because my back hurt for, like, four  days afterwards.  I arched so hard.  Basically, you tell me to do something. 
[00:56:30]  My life's in jeopardy.  I'm going to do it.  I'm like, arch!  But is your instinct to just kind of kick and...  Because that would be my instinct, just to kind of kick and flail and just try to grab  so it wasn't that pain in the ass.  Of course I would.  I'd be awful.  I'd kill us both.  Well, see, man, you would actually get yourself killed.  But I like that question.  Do you feel like you need to do that?  No, no.  I flail in fights.  I don't flail in skydiving.  I do what the guy tells me to do.  You make a great point.  The worst part is the lead up to jumping out of a plane.  Once you hit the air, once...  No matter all those things...  Once you get going, man, it all goes away. 
[00:57:00]  So why, like, wait around?  Just get it done.  It's tough.  To me, when I was in, like, high school and stuff, I would lose fights if I had to sit  around and think on it.  If it just happened and it was just, boom, in the spur of the moment, it just went, I  was always really good.  But if I had to sit there and think about it, I would start underestimating myself or  start thinking about the repercussions and the consequences and maybe I shouldn't do  this or, you know...  Remember sitting in a classroom and it was, like, oral report time and you would never  volunteer to be first and you would just sweat it out for, like, days and days and 
[00:57:30]  then finally go.  Should have been...  The person that would raise their hand and go first was the smart one.  I would always do that.  And then you get to relax for the next three days as they're doing everybody else.  Well, I always think, like, they're doing...  Huh?  I would always just think, yeah, you know, I'm screwed.  Might as well get that out of the way.  He's quickly becoming my favorite UFC fighter now, this Forrest Griffin.  Did you have a favorite before?  Yeah, right.  Did I have a favorite?  That's a good question.  I mean, we were big fans of Liddell.  Yes, whoever's sitting in the seat is our favorite.  Hey, boom.  Whoever's within fucking punching proximity. 
[00:58:00]  That's, yeah, right there.  Who have we had in?  We've had just...  Fucking Liddell, Rampage, Couture, Couture.  Fedor.  Fedor was a scary motherfucker.  Just because you can't communicate with him.  So, I love that dude, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why he's scary.  He's not like a giant dude either.  No, he's six foot.  But he doesn't crack his smile.  You don't know what he's thinking.  He's speaking Russian.  But he looks kind of happy.  Like, happy like...  You know, I sat at a press conference with him.  He sits like this.  Like, you know, a good kid in class or something. 
[00:58:30]  I'm like, what's that dude?  That dude's not tough.  I'll beat that dude.  Okay, that dude is tough.  Never mind.  He really does not give off a scary vibe at all.  No, he doesn't.  Jimmy, before today...  This is how big he is.  I mean, compared to me.  And I'm fucking little.  He's just...  He's like six foot tall.  He's not that big a dude.  Who was your favorite UFC fighter?  Not counting...  Because we're meeting for us for the first time.  I would say probably Chuck, just because I know him.  I mean...  Yeah.  I would probably say him.  Rampage was awesome.  Yeah, he's very funny.  Yeah, he's a character. 
[00:59:00]  Rampage is a character.  He hates me, by the way.  Really?  Why?  He took his belt.  I don't know.  No, I don't think they hate each other for that reason.  Something personal?  I don't know.  Rampage had a...  That was right before his...  He had a breakdown after that.  Yeah, he was...  He just...  I don't know, man.  It's all good.  I'll stay out of his way.  You can tell he doesn't like you, though.  We'll fight...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We'll fight again later.  It's no worries.  I mean, what's the point of beefing with a guy?  It's just...  A lot of you guys like each other outside the ring, so there's...  Why doesn't he like you?  Like or tolerate?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I see a lot of strong personalities. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's weird, because you think about it.  A bunch of guys do the same thing for a living.  Have similar backgrounds, you know?  Came from the same socioeconomic classes.  We're very, you know, like-minded.  But a lot of times, like-minded people, kind of the alpha male.  You notice that?  Like, always want to be the thing in the room.  And, you know, too many fighters in my room, it's no good, you know?  Yeah.  Were you...  This is a childlike non-fighter question, but were you scared when you're standing next 
[01:00:00]  to...  Eye to eye with a guy like Rampage, and you're about to fight for the belt?  I mean, what's going through your mind at that moment?  No, you're just ready to fight.  Just like I was talking about skydiving.  You think, what...  Yeah, it's not a fear you can attune to a certain person.  You know, I don't fear people, but it's the enormity of the situation.  Okay.  See, I would fear that and the person.  That's the difference.  That's why I don't fight.  People are people.  It's not, you know, whatever.  I mean, obviously, I'm fighting Anderson Silva. 
[01:00:30]  You know, that guy's worth fearing, but, you know, there's a ref in there.  Somebody else.  They probably won't kill me.  Nobody's died yet.  After a fight...  I'm well compensated.  Who cares?  If I die, the UFC will take care of my family.  I'm not too worried about it.  Jesus.  When you guys see each other after a fight, like, does the winner...  Do you guys have, like...  You guys both know that you're fucking great fighters.  Does the guy who won kind of, like, look at the other guy, like, we both know I beat your  ass, or is there none of that?  Because you know that it couldn't have went the other way.  Every encounter's different, man. 
[01:01:00]  You know, it's like, I obviously, you know, I don't know, man.  Everybody's a little different.  A lot of guys have...  Ego is healthy in life and in everything, and a lot of guys, you know, have ego, and  that's how they do it.  The way I do it, most guys, I think most fighters are very confident and think they're  the best, and that's what enables them to do their job, and to go in there and do it  is they think, they truly think they're the best, and that they can find a way to win.  I think I'm fucked. 
[01:01:30]  I might as well get it over.  So you're never really disappointed.  Get this ass whooping right out the way.  It's like, holy shit, I won.  Amazing.  Low expectations.  Key to happiness.  It's in the book.  I would say you look more like a fighter than anybody we've had in...  Like, he looks like a fighter.  Fedor looked like a social studies teacher.  He does.  He does not look like a fighter.  Yeah.  Chuck kind of looks like a problem, too.  Forrest Griffin, Godfights, the name of the book.  I look like I've been beat up a lot.  Well, there's some great pictures of you.  Like, did somebody run a car over his face? 
[01:02:00]  Holy shit.  There's some great pictures in your book.  The one I want to point out, though...  Do it, please.  ...is the one with you and your rifle.  Smart, yeah.  And the caption is great.  This is my rifle.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.  That's right.  You're a full metal jacket fan, huh?  What is it?  Yeah.  Of course, man.  Come on.  Ant loves his guns, too, there, Forrest.  Yeah, yeah.  That's actually...  That joke right there is supposed to be a ripoff of Super Troopers.  I'm supposed to be saying to Graham Mannard right there, and that's the story of the third  time I got herpes. 
[01:02:30]  But I don't know.  Like, stuff happens.  Don't write a book.  Did they change it?  Yeah, I didn't intend.  Like, it didn't make sense, but it wasn't supposed to.  It was an inside joke.  Actually, the whole book is just inside jokes, like movie quotes between me and my friends.  So there's about 50 or 60 people out there that are going to get it, and the rest of  us are going to be like, what the hell is he talking about?  We have the same thing in here, man.  Something about movie quotes and just blurting them out that makes you crack up with your friends. 
[01:03:00]  There's a photo here of, I think it's Rashad Evans.  Forrest is on his back, and Rashad is about to punch down on him, and the quote is, Forrest.  And the waiter says to the jockey, so that's how I got the football stuck in my ass.  That's the quote.  I love the fact that it's not a bunch of fight quotes.  I don't think we did the book justice, because the more you look at it, there's a lot of  jokes in here there, Forrest.  I mean, what did you expect?  Like, techniques on fighting?  Well, that's what the other guys are writing, so it's good to know that you're doing something  a little different.  I would say be in great shape and be moderately athletic and relatively large. 
[01:03:30]  That's my advice.  But what?  You're not 6'3", 230?  You're screwed.  Fight Club, this movie actually ruined my life.  Instead of taking it as a black comedy, I took it seriously.  For the longest time, I contemplated giving up all my worldly possessions and living like  a Native American.  But seriously, we all really should wear leather clothing, because that shit lasts longer than  cotton or spandex.  Yeah, no problem.  So you got all these words of wisdom in there, too.  Chuck Palahniuk's got a new book out. 
[01:04:00]  I haven't read it yet.  I heard it's kind of whatever.  You know what?  I don't know what to think.  I'm a huge fan of his books.  Yeah.  I either love them or hate them, though.  Yeah, I've liked...  Have you read most of them?  I've read Everything is Written Except the Last Two, the one about the snuff and Pygmy.  Snuff was rough to get through.  See, that's the thing, man.  I feel like every author, every movie maker, everybody, Quentin Tarantino, everybody's got  a story to tell.  And kind of like almost once they've told their story, they kind of forced... 
[01:04:30]  What is left?  Not everybody can be Stephen King, you know?  Some people have that great work, and then after that, it's whatever, you know?  No one can compare to Stephen King.  But, you know, Chuck Palahniuk, really, he's got like five good books.  They could all be great movies, I think, you know?  They blew Choke.  Choke could have been a great movie.  They fucked it up.  Oh, you're kidding me.  You like Choke?  I loved it.  I loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it.  I'm not going to argue with the UFC fire over Choke.  And it makes it better than...  What were they supposed to do with it?  I thought the book was...  That was my favorite book he's written on. 
[01:05:00]  Really?  What was Choke?  Yeah.  Choke?  How do we explain Choke?  It's a movie about a guy that likes to be choked almost to the point of unconsciousness  during sex.  This, among many other sexual proclivities.  Is it like an auto-asphyxiation type thing with a belt, or does he like someone to do it?  I mean, it's, you know, you've got a spotter there.  No, actually, you don't have a spotter.  You have another person choking you.  It's even better.  Try it.  I've had a...  Please, I've done it.  I've had a chick choke me.  I've had girls, like, slap my dick a little bit, which I kind of liked.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm more into dominating, but I kind of like... 
[01:05:30]  This one girl who used to massage me, I would be like, just slap my balls.  And she would kind of like...  Not too hard.  No, no, not really hard enough.  Just like a light slap, and I would tell her to bite me.  There was something about...  No, I only got the one nut, so I'm not any testicles.  You got one ball?  Yeah.  What happened?  I was doing power cleans in ninth grade.  Nobody told me, yeah, you shouldn't lift 200 pounds if you're 13.  I was like, okay, I can do this.  What's that?  And it felt like...  It sounded like a t-shirt ripping, and it felt like somebody threw cold water on my crotch. 
[01:06:00]  And it was really cool because...  No, it wasn't that cool, but your body is weird.  It folded me over almost slowly like a little plant closing.  And then I couldn't move from that position.  I was like, huh, I'm stuck here.  And I walked around like that for a couple days until I went to the doctor.  And they were like, yeah, you just blew out your abdominal wall.  Your intestines have fallen on this testicle.  It's come unwound.  We're going to have to take it.  That's the sign of a tough motherfucker when you walk around for a couple of days with your 
[01:06:30]  intestine on your ball.  My nut was the size of a softball, too.  The seminary roll was viscals.  So they took your testicle.  Yeah, they didn't take that bad boy.  Wow.  You got a fake one in there?  No, I don't.  You still take this fake one?  They do, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You like to just look at the expression on a girl's face as she's fishing around down there?  You know what's crazy, man?  Nobody ever says anything.  It's like, you know, it's like, well, you got a little dick.  Girls don't want it out, do they? 
[01:07:00]  Right?  They don't mention it.  They're all cool.  Oh, you know what?  I don't mind.  Did you ever hear a girl go this thick when she's licking your balls going, ahem, ah?  Nah.  I can go back to it.  That's a fucked up story.  Yeah, there's a lot worse ways to lose it.  I mean, you know, that was just amazing.  Is that story in the book?  It is, actually.  But it's even better.  The 50 Zen Principles of Hand-to-Face Combat.  I only wrote 37.  Right.  And I'm pretty sure, I actually read the book again, there's only 37 in there.  I don't know why it says that. 
[01:07:30]  They just liked the number 50.  I think it would be better, because it's the 37.  But 50's good, too.  It'd be funny if this was like a class-action lawsuit now.  Fucking soon as he told us he was going to give us 50, my 50 of his 37.  You got movie recommendations, too.  What's your favorite movie of all time?  Yeah, that's a stupid question.  How can you have a favorite movie of all time?  I don't know.  How about favorite comedy?  I don't know.  Favorite comedy.  If you put it in a genre, it's like, I would say probably Caddyshack.  Yeah, genres are doable.  It's my favorite.  Yeah, it's such a, you know, I like old school.  I don't know, man. 
[01:08:00]  Old school comedy?  Super Troopers, yeah.  What about your favorite fighting movie?  There's a Charles Bronson movie, like...  Hard Times.  Bam!  Good job.  That was a good one, man.  Wow.  Never saw it.  With the fucking guy, the bald-headed guy, he put his head down.  You mentioned Hard Times.  It's like the first MMA movie, right?  That was a good fucking bare-knuckle fighting fucking movie.  Oh, like, that's what I thought I was getting into when I was doing this.  I was like, yeah.  I was getting a pit for 50 bucks and fight some guy.  Probably lose an eye.  Sounds great. 
[01:08:30]  That's a rush.  I'm surprised you didn't mention the fucking Bronson movie they based on your life,  Kinjate.  Jesus.  Thanks.  A lot of questions coming in.  Tom in California, did you win a fight after you broke your arm during the match?  I did.  What?  True, yeah.  And I won a fight after my shoulder came completely out and was like a 14-year-old girl's  tit sitting up all high over here.  And I was like looking at it.  And I would have quit the fight.  I was looking at my shoulder in shock, like, you know, medical shock. 
[01:09:00]  Like, I didn't feel pain or anything.  I was just like, oh, my God, my shoulder's, hey, it looks like you have a tit.  And I would have quit right then, but the guy started punching me, so I just reacted  and started going with it.  And I ended up winning that fight.  And then, you know, you don't, they teach you not to block kicks like this, but still  instinctively somebody goes for you.  So you kind of go, eh.  I have a real good, eh, reflex.  He shied away and put his arm out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's radio.  It doesn't work so well.  But anyway.  How bad did you break your arm?  I mean, it's gotten better. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, I see.  It broke it like.  Who was it that broke it?  Edson Pardal.  Just some heavyweight dude in Brazil.  Did he go through both bones?  No, just the one, man.  Just the one.  And then I didn't think, ah, it's not broke.  And then I punched him.  I saw it go, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, like bouncing around.  And I was like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm in a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  My arm's just going, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.  Oh, God.  So, all right, you fought with a broken arm.  You fought with your shoulder out.  And you lost a ball.  How do you hurt this guy in a fucking bar fight? 
[01:10:00]  What do you do?  I'd go for the eyes.  I'd go for the eyes.  Go for that one remaining nut.  I'm very particular.  Kevin from Connecticut, speaking of which, his testicle had become unwound, and then  he just writes, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Sounds like the way they describe it.  Apparently, when you're doing power cleans and you rip out your abdominal wall, there's  some force that your intestines hit your nut with.  I don't know.  Let's say how to Trep.  I'm not a doctor, but I do as a piece of Teflon where my abdominal wall used to be.  Trep in Pennsylvania. 
[01:10:30]  Trep.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Forrest, August 8th.  You're fighting for the first time in Philadelphia, PA.  You're fighting silver.  How do you prepare for that fight?  I don't know.  I'm open to advice.  I don't know.  I wasn't really going to prepare, to be honest.  You want to send your old girls to meet you at Starbucks?  Yeah, I'm going to listen to the chicks at Starbucks for this one.  Keep those hands up in the circle away from the power.  Yes, ma'am, I am.  Let's go to Brad in Iowa.  Brad.  Yeah, I don't really have good answers for fight questions. 
[01:11:00]  I don't really know what I'm doing.  Well, don't you study his videos and see if he's got a weakness or something?  Yeah, I do.  Let's say I find a weakness.  I'm going to tell Brad in Iowa or whatever.  I'm going to do that.  He's like, oh, I've got a game plan.  Let me tell you what it is.  Let me tell you what I see this guy's weakness being.  I don't know.  Brad in Iowa.  Brad.  Hey.  He doesn't speak English, so I got that going for you.  I fought on the first show he fought on, and he's a really nice guy.  I got to hang out with him a little bit.  This guy fought on the same card as you.  Where was that fight? 
[01:11:30]  On your first fight?  Yeah, down in Augusta, Georgia.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  The Bell Auditorium.  I was a big old fat boy that got beat up real fast.  I was a big old fat boy that didn't train or anything, but it was great.  You're a truck driver, right?  You were a truck driver at the time, right?  Yes, sir.  I remember that fight, man.  It's good to hear from you again.  This is crazy, right?  Yeah.  I just really...  You fought like the 260...  No, he was like a 300-pound dude that had every steroid you could make pumped into his brain. 
[01:12:00]  He was like...  No, he was really like 300 pounds with 5% body fat, right?  Yeah.  It wasn't a very good and smart idea for me to fight him.  Yeah, but you know, what are you going to do, right?  It was good.  It was good.  Yeah, I'm a little bit crazy.  It was fun.  I really enjoyed watching your first fight.  You made like 300 or 400 bucks.  It was an easy way to make a couple hundred bucks, you know, considering.  That's right.  Pete's working.  I'll take a punch in the mouth for 250 quick.  Bam.  There you go.  That was my opinion.  Wow. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, it was really great getting to see your success over the years and stuff.  And I haven't fought too much since then, but it's still fun to do it every once in a while.  Well, cool, man.  That's good to hear from you.  That's funny.  Yeah, it's really great to hear from you.  All right, Brad.  I would be...  Regular love fest.  Hey, thanks, bud.  You too, man.  There goes Brad.  Let's say hi to Tom in New Hampshire.  Tom.  Hey, guys.  What's up, bud?  Hey, man.  Tom.  Tom, I didn't sleep with your girlfriend. 
[01:13:00]  Just right off the bat, I did not.  It was not me.  All right.  Great.  Thanks.  I appreciate that.  Just wanted to get that out of the way.  I was actually...  When you beat Shogun Rua, that was just...  It was fantastic.  And I was wondering about Amir Sadala, and I know you guys trained together.  Training together?  We shower together.  No, but go ahead.  That's a little inside tip, but I was just wondering how...  I've got more.  It's good improv as Steve C is, so...  But I was just wondering how Amir was doing. 
[01:13:30]  I know he's been injured, and it seems like you guys are very similar.  I was just wondering how...  Well, we're both...  He's fighting...  He's fighting...  Damn it, who's he fighting?  He's fighting Johnny Hendricks, a Southpaw wrestler.  And Amir was trained with me quite a bit.  He actually lives out in Las Vegas now.  And he went to Holland to train...  To train because they have such great wrestling in Holland.  And he's fighting the wrestler, so...  He's a retard.  No, he's going to go learn kickboxing for that big K-1 fight he's got coming up. 
[01:14:00]  I don't know, man.  You don't reason with people.  He likes Holland.  He likes training over there.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian in Tampa.  Brian.  We're talking to Forrest Griffin.  Brian.  What's up, boys?  What's up, boys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, Forrest.  You know what makes him adhering to everybody is that he's just a regular guy.  He doesn't act like he's tougher than everybody.  Right.  He jokes around.  My question is, I know he doesn't have any fight plans or routines, but does he think about  or has he thought about maybe hooking up with some camps that maybe, whatever deficiencies 
[01:14:30]  he thinks he might need, is there one camp or one session that he appreciates more that  now he's more of a name?  I'm going to answer that.  Shut up.  Yeah, an opportunity came my way to go up to Denver, actually, to the Olympic Training  Center and wrestle for a couple weeks, so I think I might do that.  It's high altitude.  It's wrestling.  I really want to be good at wrestling.  Like, I think I could do it somehow, some way, and it's one of those things if you didn't  wrestle when you were a kid, and every time I quit wrestling, it's like I start back at 
[01:15:00]  zero.  Like, I can not box for a little bit and I'll still be okay, or grappling, that comes more  easily, but wrestling is just like, it's a thought process, and I still think every  time I'm doing it, I'm thinking, what the fuck do I do next?  Whereas everything else just comes natural.  Do you get, like, fucked up when you get taken down on the ground and have to, like,  obviously you'd rather be standing up punching someone in the face.  I don't mind being on the ground. 
[01:15:30]  You know, the problem is when people punch me when I'm trying to do my jiu-jitsu.  It's quite annoying.  I'm like, guys, whoa, I thought when we hit the ground we just did this jiu-jitsu.  I like jiu-jitsu.  Not with the elbow and in the face.  Now you're hitting me very hard.  That's my eye socket.  My God, why would you do this to another human being?  That's actually what I say during the fight.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  Do you want to hurt me like this?  I would never do this to you.  I was just handing a note.  Forrest was disgusted by Steve's capri pants. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, God.  And we didn't even ask him about it.  Who is it?  Can you bring Steve in?  There's just a big, tight ass in front of my face.  Yeah, here's Steve right here.  Not only are they capris, but they're too tight.  Here she comes.  Thank you.  Can you tell him?  Because he thinks we're just messing with him.  I told him.  Because we like to mess with him.  I told him, Steve.  I just don't.  Here's a real, real man.  And I don't want to, yeah, nothing I don't cost.  Forrest, don't hold back, please.  Nothing I don't cost more than $10 and my wife didn't buy.  No, I wasn't even trying to be insulting. 
[01:16:30]  I thought that was a joke that he had those on.  Like, I thought he lost a bet or something.  Like, I'm not, I was like, oh, it's humorous, you know?  Into the frying pan out of the fight.  It's just fucking, I just got shredded.  Into the frying pan out of the fire?  Out of the frying pan out of the fire, sorry.  And it's worse.  Those are like true religion jeans, right?  Yes, they are.  Those are expensive crappy jeans.  Wow, this is exactly what we bashed him up.  Don't put them in the jean category.  Put them in the gay category.  The capris.  Culottes.  Remember culottes? 
[01:17:00]  He's wearing culottes.  Sam, what's up?  He just said on the gay channel, they cost $220.  Oh!  Oh, really?  Come on.  Yeah.  And you got shredded by the guys from the studio?  Larry and Keith just beat the shit out of me for having, from looking normal from the  thigh up and then completely.  So the gay guys wouldn't even wear this.  Yeah, the gay guys wouldn't touch this.  I got called Laurie Petri.  I don't know what that means.  It's not good, Steve.  Yeah, okay.  It's not good.  Wow.  You know, they called me Laurie Petri.  No, I didn't think it was fucking endearing, but Forrest said they're really tight, too. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  A little too tight.  A little too tight.  A little too...  But you know what?  For $220, it's worth it.  I mean, everybody else at the office is having a much better day because of your pants.  The rest of us have had...  It's $220 worth of a laugh to me.  Yeah, look at that.  The joy you brought.  As long as it's your money.  You sure have a positive spin on things.  Yeah.  I fucking love Forrest Griffin.  Hilarious.  I mean, I'm better for having to see this.  It cheered me right up.  I slept literally three hours last night, and I saw his pants, and I was just excited 
[01:18:00]  to do this.  I'm in the kind of place where they like to party in capris that are tight nonetheless.  Hey, Steve.  You had to wear the capris today.  We're going to Forrest Griffin.  With fringes.  Yeah, he'll come back.  We got Joe Frazier tomorrow.  Bring your sundress.  Is Frazier tomorrow?  Tomorrow, yeah.  Scott in Florida.  Scott.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, Scott.  Hey, Forrest.  Big time fan.  Big, big fan.  Watched probably every fight you've ever fought. 
[01:18:30]  Thank you very much, sir.  I heard the rumor that they said before that you enjoy getting punched in the face at the  beginning of the fight to wake you up.  Is that true?  You know, yeah.  I've often said that, and that used to be the case.  Something happened along the way.  I got old.  And, you know, I think you get old.  All right, here's the deal.  If you're going to be dumb, you better be tough.  And I've always been tough.  But you know what?  I'm sick of being tough.  Being tough hurts in the morning when you wake up.  So now I'm trying to be smarter so I can not be so tough. 
[01:19:00]  If that makes any sense.  I don't like to get punched anymore.  I used to be into that.  I used to be like, fuck it.  Yeah, hit me.  Let's get this party started.  So the fight would start, and you want to take a blow to the face.  Yeah, it wakes you right up.  Boom.  You're going.  Will you let Jimmy punch you in the face?  We'll see what happens.  It's better than a shit.  I told you.  I'm out of it now.  It's over my face.  Also, tip in the book, if you're into getting drunk and getting strippers to punch you,  make sure they take their rings off first, especially if you have a fight coming up.  Rings, facial scarring, bad. 
[01:19:30]  So you think these scars are from, like, cool stuff, like fights.  But, you know, it's from paying strippers to punch me in the face.  Yeah, not getting them to take their rings off.  God bless you.  Hey, well, you know, it was a pleasure to talk to you for us now.  We hope to see you again fighting.  Jimmy, you guys.  I like to party.  First time I ever called in, you guys have to answer the phone.  All right, cool, Scott.  Thanks.  Hey, who's, and this is probably a good novice question, but who hits the hardest?  Have you had to pick one that you've ever fought? 
[01:20:00]  You just asked me that.  Well, not the people I've fought.  People that have hit me hard in fights, I couldn't tell you.  I wasn't really there.  I woke up, and I was like, damn, he hit me hard.  That was a hard time.  I was watching it.  Jeremy Hoard kicked me in the neck, and I was like, I remember, well, I don't remember  something, and then I remember arguing with the ref that I'm fine.  Why are you stopping this fight?  And the referee literally shakes my shoulder and points at the replay, and I said, oh, thank  you.  Thank you for stopping that.  I could have been killed. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, my God.  I was like, whoa, that happened?  I was like, whoa, this is, it was surreal, because I was like, that didn't just happen.  You're like, I don't, I didn't feel like I'd been knocked out.  Yeah, take a look.  I was like, oh, oh, you kicked me in the neck.  It's the part you were unconscious for.  Oh, my God, you gave me whiplash.  Wow.  Is there any sense of embarrassment after you get knocked out and you're getting up?  Fuck yeah.  It's horrible.  It's the worst feeling in the world.  You just got turned off.  In fighting, like, if you can turn somebody off, that's the thing.  It's like, man, I could have raped your ass when you were down there.  You know, I used to knock people out in the street, and we would actually pull their pants 
[01:21:00]  down and tape them to light poles.  You would actually carry tape in case you hit somebody?  I would have athletic tape on me.  You just taped them to, like, a light pole.  Is that not, is that not, you're not supposed to do that?  That's great.  God damn.  People are saying best UFC guest ever.  Yeah, I agree.  Has to be said.  Todd on Long Island.  That's my mom, ironically.  Todd, what's up?  Todd?  Who's Todd?  I don't want to talk to anyone. 
[01:21:30]  That sucks.  His question is, have you ever had unorthodox training like chasing a chicken?  Yeah.  What's that, Todd?  Todd.  Where I'm from, we chase sheep, but that's not fight training per se.  It's for fun.  Are you familiar with stump broke, son?  Ah.  That's when they could back right up to that stump.  Oh.  Or the boots.  You've got to get the sheep's feet in the tops of your boots.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Every good animal fucker knows how to run. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, he likes to party.  Or in a pinch, you just break the front legs of the animal, so it has to kind of, so it's  kind of bend over with its little animal ass up in the air.  We should play him our chicken audio.  Oh, it's horrible.  If you're a fan of that stuff, we got audio of a German guy having sex with a chicken.  For real though?  Yeah.  And you hear the chicken kind of crying.  The chicken objects.  I mean, I don't speak that language.  Do we have that for Forrest?  No, it's not, man.  It's horrible.  I'm not saying it's a good thing.  I mean, joking about it's one thing, but I mean, actually, like, going through with  it, that's pretty horrible.  Hearing it's awful, and filming it's worse. 
[01:22:30]  Let's see how much you can get through.  Okay.  Oh.  It's no video.  Just audio.  Audio.  Great soundtrack.  This is seriously disturbing.  It's not happening yet, though.  The old pedophile talking.  It's not happening.  You can hear when it starts.  Yeah, learn. 
[01:23:00]  Learn.  Tell us when it's happening.  I thought I was fucked up.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I must say, you guys, you guys have taken me to the limit.  It takes a lot to make me uncomfortable.  Apparently, chicken fucking.  Yeah, I did.  Good call.  He tapped.  You're the gay producer in capri pants and chicken fucking.  Yeah, he'll be back soon.  Apparently, I do have a, yeah, I didn't think I was easily shocked or dissuaded, but I'm 
[01:23:30]  impressed.  You know, I usually do these radio interviews where you can't even cuss, and you guys fuck  chickens.  Holy crap.  Oh, my goodness.  We have to take a break, but Forrest, man, what a great guest.  For real, man.  God fight.  Very honest.  Yeah.  And you know, I tell you why occasionally I do like myself.  Like, I didn't even pick this picture.  Like, I kind of like, they showed me a bunch of pictures, and I'm like, which one do you  like?  And I really pointed to the one in which I thought I looked the worst. 
[01:24:00]  I was like, that's not even a good picture.  I look like, I don't even know.  It looks like a mug shot.  It does look like a mug shot.  Straight up mug shot.  I like the grooming of the hair.  That's nice, right?  Yeah, that is good.  Groomed via ball cap.  But that's you.  You're not trying to, like, you're not trying to polish it up.  This is you.  Which, you know, yeah, but.  What's wrong with that?  It's funny.  Like, people don't get that.  They probably wanted you to get all fucking.  People don't get that.  They were like, ah, you want to cover your hair? 
[01:24:30]  Let's get a good picture.  I was like, no, that is a good picture.  It's horrible.  And they probably tried to talk you out of that picture, right?  They said, look, why don't we get one where.  Well, they were just like, it's kind of a bad picture.  I was like, exactly.  They're like, you could probably sell more copies if you had a good looking guy on the cover.  Well, it's not written by a good looking guy.  So, yeah, screw you guys.  He's got some good quotes on the back.  He's got a quote from Rogan, a quote from Liddell.  How great is Rogan?  Did you hang out with Rogan?  Yeah, and I've seen his comedy a couple times, too.  I love Rogan's comedy.  It's very different. 
[01:25:00]  He makes you think.  He's good, yeah.  I went up to him after a show, and he's literally covered in sweat, like soaked, sitting there drinking a water.  And he, I mean, if you've ever seen his show, you think he's like hyper when he does the fights.  In his comedy, he's really fucking hyper.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's sweating, and he's just like crazy veins in his neck.  And then, like, of course, I do.  God, I'm such a douche.  I do what everybody does.  You try to make him laugh or tell a joke?  I start telling him fucking jokes.  And he looks at me just like I look at people when they're telling me about fighting. 
[01:25:30]  And I'm just like, really?  Really?  You're going to tell me about fighting?  And I'm like, really?  I'm going to tell Joe Rogan about comedy?  What the fuck's wrong with me?  Shut up, Forrest.  I should be asking this guy questions.  What the fuck?  Was he polite about it, though?  Well, I mean, I saw the sour look on his face, and I realized Joe Rogan would rather talk to me about fighting than about comedy.  Yeah, Joe's a fucking, Joe's a Neanderthal who's funny.  Joe's, like, by far the toughest comic.  He's the one we know. 
[01:26:00]  You can't fuck with Rogan.  Well, yeah, you know, and that's the thing, you know.  He never, you know, he never, like, puts himself out there as a fighter, but he'll fight you.  Oh, yeah.  He's fucking, he's got some issues.  You know, I like, though, that he says the divide between fighting people and fighting fighters.  He's like, I'll fight people, but I don't fight fighters.  That's a horrible idea.  He's the worst, the worst, the worst of Opian Anthony.  Worst of Opian Anthony coming up after the break.  Steve, a lady, she possibly got a bit lippy. 
[01:26:30]  She wasn't paying attention, and her husband shot her in the face.  As she should have been.  Sorry.  A lady gets a face transplant, and you hear all the gruesome details.  Coming up after the break on the worst of Opian Anthony.  Worst of Opian Anthony, I am EROC hosting.  Sam is not here right now, so I have Steve C.  He's busy.  Steve was kind enough to come in, because he had nothing else to do.  Bullshit, I had nothing else to do.  I just figured it would be a good opportunity to help out Eric, who's perpetually stressed. 
[01:27:00]  All right, well, I had nothing better to do, so I decided to host this worst of.  We'll leave it at that.  Face transplant.  Steve, what do you know about this?  Painful.  Never do it again.  Look.  Where's the before and after?  Before?  After.  That's left and right.  That doesn't count.  Face transplant.  It's a story about a lady who got a face transplant.  She got shot in the face by her husband.  That's fun.  And had to have her face reconstructed.  So, we discussed this lady in great detail. 
[01:27:30]  So, here's part one of the face transplant lady on the worst of Opian Anthony.  You're listening to the worst.  Holy shit.  The worst of Opian Anthony.  Fuck it.  Oh, fuck it.  Yeah, that's your answer.  That's your answer to everything.  Uh, the first face transplant picture.  This is horrific.  Yeah.  We're building monsters.  Monsters.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  This is horrific.  And I was telling Anthony, probably what the deal is with this picture, the guy who did  the first face transplant probably is a wonderful surgeon.  Probably one of the best in the world.  It would have to be.  But he probably was awful in art.  A horrible artist.  And that's the problem that these surgeons face.  Really good surgeons, bad at art.  I mean, they really, um, piled on the flesh. 
[01:28:30]  How do you describe it?  Like, she's got jowls.  Teasing E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  She's got these big hanging jowls.  Yeah, yeah.  It's, uh, it's like they, the donor face was off a real big fat woman.  And they didn't know how to thin that face down before they sewed it on.  She looks like the lady in, in, in Total Recall. 
[01:29:00]  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Yes.  I think, I think the picture on the left.  Twist her ears and look like Arnold.  You'd be better off.  The picture on the left where she has only, like, she still has a ways to go.  Yeah.  I guess she still doesn't have a nose with the picture on the left.  Uh-huh.  The lips aren't really defined yet.  She looks like a Star Wars character.  Yeah, I would rather walk around like that than the final product.  Yeah.  She was all right, too.  I mean.  She was a pretty cute, you know. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Middle-aged woman.  And what happened?  She got a shotgun blast to the face?  Well, a little shotgun to the face might do that to you.  I mean, everyone's checking out the pictures today.  There's a picture in Newsday where they have a CAT scan of her face.  Oh, the bones, yeah.  Of her face after she got the shotgun blast.  Hold on a minute.  What?  What, E-Rock?  Go ahead.  What?  Oh, my God.  Disappointing.  Go ahead.  What?  Oh, God.  What, E-Rock?  No, it was something Danny was looking up that the news actually had her photos labeled  as monster face, and there's like two different versions of it. 
[01:30:00]  And then there's I'm no monster.  She was cute.  That's a good one, E-Rock.  Poor Eric.  That was worth stopping the entire show for.  Poor sweetie.  Thank you.  The picture in Newsday, though, they have a CAT scan of her bone structure after she took  the shotgun blast to the face.  Yeah.  And her bones are just shattered.  I guess that's the problem.  Below the eyeballs.  I guess that's the problem is they had to rebuild all that shit underneath. 
[01:30:30]  Like, you can't rebuild the house without the foundation.  And that's like what they did.  And the top of her head is very tiny and dainty and ladylike.  And then from right at the side of her head where your eyes are, down to the mouth, is  this giant fat head.  I'm trying to. 
[01:31:00]  Do you walk around?  What's worse?  I mean, obviously, I guess the no nose is worse and the permanent face.  Just go like this.  Turn the corners of your mouth down.  Oh, also, cut your nose off.  She was spiting her face.  If you had a face transplant, would you ever look into the mirror again?  Oh, my God.  For real.  Only from the bridge of your nose up.  I would never look in a mirror. 
[01:31:30]  Because I would be like, oh, my God, who is this person?  That's not me.  She looks nothing like she used to.  She should have committed crimes beforehand.  She'd get away with it.  What'd she look like?  Not that.  Nope.  Put her in a lineup.  It ain't her.  Do we have a prize for the person that comes up with the best description of face transplant  lady?  Oh.  Do we have any prizes in our prize closet?  Probably not.  We should maybe get a prize closet.  We haven't had a prize closet in, what, five or six years?  Her glasses are resting on her fake cheeks. 
[01:32:00]  Is it really bad to laugh?  Doesn't it shrink, though?  Like, the lady in France had one, and her face kind of shrunk after a while.  Did it?  Yeah.  I think you adjust to it.  I think the reason why the face was shrinking was because it was rotting off her face.  Do we have this story?  Off her head.  Was it a boyfriend that fucking got a little angry?  Got a little pissed off about what?  Dinner burnt?  He shot her in the face, and then he shot himself.  And I think he's alive.  What a terrible shot. 
[01:32:30]  He's alive, too?  He only got seven years for it.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Maria on Long Island.  What does he look like?  I don't know.  Probably not as bad, because we don't have any pictures of him.  She was cute back when she was, before she was showing her.  Yeah, sure.  Maria!  Good morning.  Good morning.  How are ya?  We're, uh, good.  How are ya?  How are ya?  Uh, first of all, last night watching the news, my husband looked at me because I busted  out laughing and said, what happened to you?  And the only thing I can confess is you guys. 
[01:33:00]  But I personally thought she looked like Sigmund from Sigmund and the Sea Monster.  Sigmund, uh, the little sea monster.  And this is before surgery, right?  Yeah, this, wow, she looks...  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Thank you, boys.  Have a great day.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what you're supposed to do with this story.  I, I mean, I see something like that.  I just, I have to just kind of laugh.  What does he look like?  He, Culp's husband, Thomas, shot her in 2004, turned the gun on himself.  He went to prison for seven years. 
[01:33:30]  His wife was left clinging to life.  Blast shattered her nose, cheeks, the roof of her mouth, and an eye.  Right in the middle of the face.  Hundreds of fragments of shotgun pellet and bone splinters were embedded in her face.  She needed a tube into her windpipe to breathe.  Only her upper eyelids, forehead, lower lip, and chin were left.  She must have looked, before they sewed this shut, as you can see where, before this, this  transplant surgery, it's from cheek to cheek.  They sewed her shut. 
[01:34:00]  That, that was just laid open like a big hole in her face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How did she live through that?  Wow.  I don't know.  So did he, though.  Maybe it was a...  Yeah, what did he do?  Like, oh, my toe.  Yeah, how do you live through that is right.  Well, I mean, none of that, none of the shotgun blast went into her brain, obviously.  It was all below her eyes.  So I guess that's just safe area.  It's going to make a mess, but you're going to survive that.  Oh, here I am five years later, he did what he said. 
[01:34:30]  I got my nose, Culp said, laughing of her doctor, I guess.  Laughing.  Bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff.  Once while shopping, she heard a little kid say, you said you were no real, oh, you said  there were no real monsters, Mommy, and there's one right there.  Kids are, kids are little fucking pricks, aren't they?  Well, they're honest.  She said, I'm not a monster, I'm a person who was shot and pulled out her driver's license 
[01:35:00]  to show the child what she used to look like.  I'd have gone, argh, and scared the shit out of the little fucker.  Well, now that she's had the face transplant, maybe she should get the facelift.  Yeah, she could use a facelift.  Now she could use a nice facelift.  And that's dead person face right there.  Is it really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She's got dead person face, nerves, skin, muscle, bone, blood vessels. 
[01:35:30]  Someone is looking at this going, I know her.  I thought she was dead.  It's a whole fat face.  Let's say hi to John in Chicago.  John?  Oh, mountain head.  I remember her.  Oh, shit.  Oh, her she's kissing.  Oh, boys.  Oh, she's kissing.  Oh, that's horrid.  Hey, John.  Hey, John.  What's up?  Hey, uh...  Boom.  I was watching that news conference yesterday.  We were halfway through it before I realized they wanted to interview with Jay Leno's sister.  Oh, wow.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  Well.  This is her talking, by the way.  You want to hear her talk?  Yeah, please.  Well, I guess I'm the one who came to see today.  Oh, uncomfortable laughter.  My name's Connie, and, uh...  Well, I know what you're talking about.  I think it's one point that you focus on... 
[01:36:30]  the family that made it so I could have this Christmas present, I guess I should say,  and all the great doctors with their intelligence to be able to do this  and doctor seminars for all her years of experience.  And all my great nurses, I mean, they're like, they're my family.  You know, Pat here, she's my motivator.  She's like, got me to exercise and eat my greens and drink my water. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, my God.  Yes.  We're finding pictures of what she looks like.  And what is that, American Dad?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is Stan Smith from American Dad.  Stan Smith.  Good old Stan Smith.  From American Dad.  She looks just like him.  Oh, God.  She still has her nice Southern Belle voice, though.  Anyone notice that?  It's a little muffled, but she still has that Southern Belle thing happening.  Let's say hi to John in New York.  Something.  John?  Hey, you know who I think she looks like?  Speaking of cartoons, the South Park episode when the Ass Face family shows up looking for Ben Affleck. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Great.  Very good.  It's all cartoons that she looks like.  Yeah, that's not a good sign.  She just looks like a homely lady.  I guess that's not bad compared to laying in the hospital with a hole in your face.  I reckon.  I would assume that the swelling is going to continue to go down or something, because there's  no way they would just put her back on the street like this.  Back on the street.  She's not ready.  She's not street legal. 
[01:38:00]  No, not yet.  Maybe, yeah.  Maybe there's, like, drains or something that have to drain fluid out of her face or something.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I like Danny pulls up a webpage and there's just some chick bent over with her asshole showing.  Dude, no matter what you search for, you're going to get at least three or four results.  Yeah, at least three or four things are going to be just porno.  Let's say hi to Bob in Boston.  Bob?  Hey, she looks like a hot, melted Mr. Potato Head.  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit, a little bit.  There's definitely a Mr. Potato Head thing going on there. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Night.  Nice.  All right, let's go back to her talking.  Good, Chad.  He slept hours with me.  He slept three days by my bedside when I was in ICU all night.  So, I mean, I can't tell you how good all doctors are.  I'm going to forget all of them.  But, Ron, he helped me with my sweet therapy.  We'll never forget you either.  I mean, I just can't say nothing about the team.  And, I don't know, I mean, but what I really want to say is, I mean, even my daughter, I love her so much. 
[01:39:00]  She called me up.  Just down the roof, she called me and didn't even know I was having a bad day.  She had a magic in the background.  And I couldn't talk and she just got my old grandson talking to my mom.  Why shut up?  I have no idea what she's saying.  I know.  I can't even understand her.  Everyone's just sitting there all polite.  No one knows what you're saying.  Oh, you hear the cameras going off, though.  Oh, yeah.  They want pictures of this. 
[01:39:30]  Keep talking so we can get as many pictures as possible.  I'm laughing because the descriptions of what she looks like, they're killing me.  Listen to this one.  Todd in Jersey.  Todd.  Todd looks like the ghost of Pac-Man.  Oh, shit.  She looks like a Pac-Man ghost.  Yes.  Oh, that's horrible.  And this one.  Ron in Georgia.  Ron.  Peter ran.  Chet from Weird Science.  All right, Chet from Weird Science after he was turned into a big pile of shit. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, God damn.  Chet from Weird Science.  Oh, fuck.  That's terrible.  Oh, shit.  So far.  So far.  That nails it.  Chet from Weird Science.  Oh, my God.  Hey, what did you do to me?  This next clip.  Maybe we shouldn't play because I think it's for you and I and Jimmy and our listeners. 
[01:40:30]  It's titled Face Transplant Lady Tells People Not to Judge.  Oh, well, don't judge.  Oh, what is that?  It's Pizza the Hut from Spaceballs.  Pizza the Hut from Spaceballs.  There's another one.  That just looks like Chet with icing on him.  You know what?  I'm old school.  I'm all about the sideshow.  This used to be sideshow stuff.  Oh, yeah.  You'd put her in a circus.  You used to, you know, you wouldn't allow the monsters to talk.  You would put them behind some kind of curtain.  My friends. 
[01:41:00]  You'd pay your quarter or your dollar and you would check this shit out.  Now they're front and center doing press conferences.  I just want to say that when somebody had to just fuck them and don't look as pretty  as you do, don't judge them because you never know what happened to them.  I was shot.  I don't know anybody knows that, but I was shot and I don't want to go into it.  And I'm 46, so I was 40 years old when it happened. 
[01:41:30]  And with that song, it says, you know, if I was 40 and I could fly and all that.  Boy, that really hit him when that song came out.  And that came out that same year.  You never know what might happen to you.  You might get in the car wreck if they could be in for one day.  So those people don't look the same as you do.  You never know.  One day it might be all taken away.  So, thank you all. 
[01:42:00]  I think that's all I've got to say.  Thank you.  Oh, I thought that was more gunfire.  Holy Jesus.  Kill it.  What song was she talking about?  I Believe I Can Fly?  I Believe I Can.  Ah!  Wouldn't she be top heavy?  I mean, she can't fly.  No, no, no.  She's like the spruce goose.  I Believe I Can Fly.  Here's another one.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Mark in Louisiana.  Mark! 
[01:42:30]  Hi, guys.  Hey, Mark.  I'd like to introduce you to the 2009 champion of the Chubby Bunny contest.  Oh, God damn it.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe.  Hi.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, you guys are all blowing it, man.  Yeah.  It's the latest Susan Boyle makeover.  Oh, that's Susan Boyle.  Punching out, guys.  All right.  Carl in Massachusetts.  Red Sox beat the Yankees last night. 
[01:43:00]  Is that what happened?  Red Sox swept the Yankees again?  Couldn't tell you.  Yeah.  No, I figured.  Don't follow him.  It did.  Gentlemen.  Yes.  He looks like Slimer from the Ghostbusters.  Slimer from Ghostbusters.  Yeah, you know, the same type of pointy-headed thing.  Hershey kiss head.  Oh, maybe that one.  Yeah, a little bit.  The cheekbones are there.  That's for sure.  Quagmire from Family Guy is coming in. 
[01:43:30]  Robin in Detroit.  She's a regular to the show.  Looks like a Fat Albert character.  That's Bill and Hoboken.  Oh, God.  Any Fraggle Rock fans out there?  Do you feel like the Garbage Pile from Fraggle Rock?  Garbage Pile from Fraggle Rock.  I need a reference point of that.  I haven't seen Fraggle Rock in a long time.  Let's see Garbage Pile.  But if you can find the music video to a song called Starlight by the Superman Lover, 
[01:44:00]  she looks fucking exactly like that potato thing.  Potato thing.  That potato thing.  Punching out.  Thank you, Cody.  Wow.  A little bit, a little bit.  We're talking about face transplant, woman.  Yes.  If you turned the news on this morning or opened up a newspaper,  you couldn't help but be horrified by looking at it.  I kind of feel bad.  I'm laughing, but.  Yeah, it's one of those things, you know, she's probably been through some shit.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  Fuck.  But this is all people are going to be talking about this morning.  Look, every TV has.  Yeah, they're showing what they did to her.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Which obviously is amazing.  Yeah, but they're showing it like it's just snapping on and everything was fine,  but that obviously isn't the case.  No.  So, the whole middle of her face was not hers.  It wasn't there.  Right.  Below the eyes, all the way down in the jaw.  They had to rebuild the jaw and everything.  Yeah, she was just fucking gone.  Do yourself a favor. 
[01:45:00]  Try to find, not many newspapers are carrying the picture of her CAT scan  where they show the bones and what happens to the bones after the shotgun blast.  It's amazing.  It's just all fragments below her eyes.  You know what the problem is, too, that she has thinny-thin hair.  She needs to have like a poofed-out hair moire.  She needs big Farrah hair from the 70s.  Yeah, her hair, it just looks like a sheet of hair paper.  It's just too thin.  She put her head.  It's too thin.  You're right.  Fluff that shit up a little bit. 
[01:45:30]  It's too thin for the top of her head.  She needs that to be huge.  Hey, candy corn head.  Fluff that do up.  Check her cheeks with a tire pressure gauge.  Someone over-inflated her face.  Let's go to Steve, the trucker.  Steve.  What's up, boys?  Hey, Steve.  Hey, there.  Hey, she looks like the trucking head dude off of Beetlejuice.  Oh, Beetlejuice reference.  Yeah, a little bit of that.  It's been a while.  Later, boys.  Thank you, sir.  Okay, let me say hi to Joe in Boston. 
[01:46:00]  Joe!  My spit fits everywhere.  Good for this lady.  What can I tell you?  Beach the option, I guess.  Yeah, you know.  I mean, it's nice that they got some kind of option for people that have lost their faces.  Like, she's not pleasant to look at, but it's like you don't know.  Like, you're not going to run screaming.  Right.  Like, if you look at her, you're just like, yeah, that's an odd-looking lady.  Yeah.  I got people in my family that are uglier than this woman.  Simple as that.  And they didn't have a face transplant. 
[01:46:30]  It is better than it was.  Not my immediate family, by the way.  We're all gorgeous.  We all could have been models.  Little kids might still look like, mother, there's a pile of mashed potatoes with glasses  talking to me.  Her nickname is going to be old Wispywig.  Richard Dreyfuss is slapping her cheeks going, I know this.  This means something.  Yes.  Yes.  Close encounters.  Old devil's tower head. 
[01:47:00]  Looks like shit demon from Dogma.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  That's Ty in Ohio.  I don't have time to get to him.  Great.  Two piles of shit, she looks like.  Jim in New York.  How are you, Jim?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up?  I got two questions.  Yeah.  One, would you let the monster blow you for the goof back there?  Yeah.  I was just going to answer, yeah, without a doubt.  You know.  You do stuff for the story.  I might have to videotape it and let my friends watch just if it kicks. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  And the second thing is, would you hook it up with half a Hulk face and really watch  the fun begin?  Wow, yeah.  Wow is right.  Her and a half a Hulk face.  Wow is right.  Well, we got together and fell in love.  You know, thanks, fellas.  Punch it out.  I didn't know you could do half a Hulk face.  Yeah.  It's pretty easy.  It's more physical than anything else.  You notice we turned him around?  First time he came around, he was an angry motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  Angry.  And now he accepts it and he knows, you know. 
[01:48:00]  He's embraced and loved by people.  That's his thing.  He has embraced the whole half a Hulk face thing now.  You know why he knows like if he goes to an O&A event or something like that, like everyone  knows who he is.  So they're not going to look and go, they look at him and go, hey, half a Hulk face.  What's up?  They're actually getting to know him as a person.  You make a very good point.  I know we like to make a lot of jokes on this show.  We like to make a mockery of everything, especially people's misfortune. 
[01:48:30]  But if he walks through a mall, people are pointing, staring, running, screaming.  If I had an O&A event, people go, have Hulk faces here?  Yeah.  They take their quick look.  Hey, have Hulk face.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Can I get a picture with you?  And then they start talking to you.  For real?  Yeah.  And then there's some chit-chat.  And you realize, you know, yeah, the guy's not, you know, he's actually a guy.  We're helping by making fun of people. 
[01:49:00]  Are we?  Yeah.  It's the worst.  The worst.  The worst.  Of Opian Anthony.  Worst of Opian Anthony continuing with the face transplant lady.  This is part two.  Patrice is now involved and he's disgusted by all of this.  And I'm sure it's only white people could come up with face transplants and all this  other fun stuff.  I just, I like the fact that you were shot in the face.  That's funny.  All right.  Let's check it out.  Worst of Opian Anthony.  The worst. 
[01:49:30]  Of Opian Anthony.  I know.  Man, we just did 20 minutes with Patrice.  That should have been on the air.  I hate this.  You know, it happens.  That's why maybe we got to keep you guys outside the door until we go live.  And he's talking about like Facebook and Twitter and being on the grid and being off the grid.  It's my first time here at the wonderful new compound, man.  How are you guys doing?  It's wonderful, isn't it?  Well, you know.  They don't really understand.  It hurts.  It hurts.  Thank you.  It's the trickle down theory.  Because when I say it, they're like, oh, you know, he's not grateful. 
[01:50:00]  Well, you know, come on.  You're not grateful?  Yeah.  Look, for hotel wallpaper and a wooden plank as crown molding, they disguised.  That looks like something my mother beat me with.  But they would argue they did the right thing and they built us a nice studio over here.  Here's what they did.  They brought your old TVs over and put them on the on the wallpaper and then put an Opie  and Anthony sign up. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  And now it's this is should be reserved for for an old school newsman.  Yeah.  This is not right.  This is not right.  Thank you, Patrice.  Fun and frolics and friendship and comfort and happy.  There's no room for shenanigans.  Every second of your fucking voice talking is going to be resentment.  Have you seen her yet?  How about Dom DeLuise Dive?  It's Jabba the Hutt.  She looks like Jabba.  Face transplant lady.  Why the fuck is her head twice as big as it should be? 
[01:51:00]  She looks like one of those where the wild things are, people.  She was shot in the face with a shotgun.  This ain't the same technology as Face Off.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The movies made it look so nice.  Yeah.  You put John Travolta's face on.  You look like John Travolta.  Just remove my face.  Yeah.  That's all.  I'd rather them put the fucking Matt, the William Shatner Matt from Halloween just  over my shotgun blast.  At least it's proportioned.  You know what?  You're right.  Are you fucking kidding me? 
[01:51:30]  Sometimes I wish I wasn't afraid.  You know that old saying, everybody want to go to heaven but nobody want to die?  Yeah.  Sure.  I wish I just knew it was a heaven and if something like that happened to me, I'd just  be like, I'm going to heaven anyway.  Check out.  I'm out.  It don't matter.  Please don't leave me with jowls.  Like seven different faces.  That bitch looks prehistoric.  And another thing I'm going to have, I'm going to be cremated because you're not going  don't have me in some oil in the year 8,000 motherfucker. 
[01:52:00]  You don't want to be fossil fuel?  800.  Nah, nigga.  You ain't putting me in nobody's gas tank, bitch.  Fossil fuel for treats.  Burn me and smoke me if you want to.  And you know what's fucked up?  Your whole existence might amount to one fucking piston push going down.  Just one.  Like some cocksucker named Earl in the year 4 million is changing some spacely sprocketing  with my ass. 
[01:52:30]  Fuck you.  This ugly bitch could be oil, not me.  As they find her face, right?  And they reconstruct it and say, this is what all of them look like.  Son of a bitch.  Imagine that, yeah.  We've reconstructed and this is what people look like back in the year 20.  A new creature that we found.  Jowl face.  And this is the male jowl face.  Big jowls hanging down on their shoulders. 
[01:53:00]  People were ugly in the past.  Oh, damn.  Nigga.  I can eat my ass, nigga.  Burn me to death.  Burn me, man.  Cook me.  Cream ate me.  You think she got rid of her Facebook page?  Oh, God.  She's got a huge face.  A lady got shot in the face with a shotgun, walks in the bar.  The bar's in the ghost.  Why the long face?  Why the giant face?  Big face, bitch.  I can't stand how we have to give a fuck about somebody who gets from ugly to uglier. 
[01:53:30]  Thank you.  She went from looking like she just chewed 12 lemons to looking like she just has them in her mouth.  Like she looked like she was eating them before.  Now she looked like she has them stuffed in her mouth.  You bulldog face, bitch.  Get out of here, punk face.  She went.  She went.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[01:54:00]  Get the picture.  Oh, my God.  That bitch.  That fucking Easter Island head bitch.  Get the fuck out of here, man.  What?  I thought we did this story justice two hours ago, but you just blew us out of the water, Patrice.  I'm still laughing at the middle picture saying it looks like she was sucking on lemons.  And then the next one is, get out of here.  Oh, my God, droopy dog. 
[01:54:30]  I don't want to see her ever again.  But she's trying to say she's not a monster, Patrice.  I'm not a monster.  She wants everyone to know she's not a monster.  What's the bitch that's singing this ugly?  But she looks just like her.  I'll be out of Boyle.  Susan Boyle.  She looks like Susan Boyle.  They took her from looking like a decent woman to a fucking mess to Susan Boyle's sister.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  She's all mouth.  You couldn't even come up with Easter Island head. 
[01:55:00]  I know.  It really is.  Look at the fucking head.  Why didn't we get that one out there?  That giant head.  Her head is a big pyramid.  Like, it's a giant, twisted...  God, damn.  You know what?  Like an Easter Island.  It looks like a prehistoric arrowhead.  You ever see the stone arrowheads from Apocalypto?  You big Apocalypto accent, bitch.  Look at the Easter Island head.  Just stop.  God, Easter Island is exactly what she looks like.  Will you stop forcing me to fucking give a shit about shit like this? 
[01:55:30]  And you know what?  You can't just look at the face pictures that everyone's looking at on the internet.  You've got to see the full body because the head is gigantic on her body.  It looks like she's dislodged her jaw, swallowed a cinder block, and it's going down her neck.  I wish to God I had enough fucking balls to completely believe in the Bible, completely believe in heaven.  So if something happens like that, I could just say, they go, Patrice, what do you want us to do?  And I'm just going to carry.  What?  Pull the plug.  Carry. 
[01:56:00]  Pull the plug.  Lighting a fire.  Coming out the window.  Carry.  Going in the water.  In the ocean.  Take you to Australia.  And find out where they have a lot of socks.  And throw me in the fucking water in Australia.  And have them eat me.  Man, I've got cut my head off first and have them eat my head.  Going to the lobsters.  The carnivorous lobsters and fucking kill me. 
[01:56:30]  Holy shit.  I'm going to fucking heaven anyway.  Why would you leave me alive with this face?  I don't want this fucking face.  Can I get it back?  Can I fucking get her a seat for this fucking face?  You motherfuckers.  This is what you did to me.  You gave me a pointy head and giant jaws as a fucking finger?  Fucking fucking dick.  What'd you say, but you?  How'd I do it?  Take a look at this. 
[01:57:00]  You have a receipt for the choice.  I want a different place.  Niggas died all day.  They get shot in the chest.  I want a fucking regular face transplant.  I heard a nigga died in jail yesterday.  I want a fucking good looking motherfucker too.  Holy shit.  It's like, don't any models die?  Don't give me this much.  Didn't a fucking model die?  Yeah, but he was white.  I don't give a fuck. 
[01:57:30]  Look at how good looking this nigga is.  You gave me...  Who died with a pointy head that was...  That was compatible?  What'd you say?  Compatible.  Fucking...  I got a fucking headache.  Are you fucking serious?  Stop fucking forcing me to...  She looks like a howitzer shell.  What is wrong with...  I'm fucking...  I'm fucking...  I'm fucking...  I'm fucking...  She looks like...  I'm deceiving.  Artillery.  You fucking...  I'm like somebody loads a head. 
[01:58:00]  Oh shit.  Oh god damn.  Oh.  Mommy, there's a pet dispenser coming.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh fuck, are you serious?  People want to...  Did you say carnivorous lobsters?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because they got it out there.  Chris goes, did he say carnivorous lobsters?  Carnivorous.  Feed the head.  Throw my face to the carnivorous lobsters.  Feed my head to those...  Those tough carnivorous lobsters in Australia.  Save the transplant and show us money. 
[01:58:30]  Holy shit.  I already picked up on carnivorous lobsters.  Oh man.  Carnivorous lobsters.  And I'm fucking getting eaten with Basin Daly and his girlfriend.  Mother.  Oh.  Oh god.  Fucking Alan Shepard should be in that head going around the earth.  It's his chest.  Old Mercury capsule head.  It's...  Why I do that?  I don't.  The news.  Why do you force me to give a fuck about...  I don't give a fuck about that shit. 
[01:59:00]  I'm with you.  I barely give a shit about the people around me.  Don't fucking force me to...  Why am I going to give a shit about a stranger that had an unfortunate thing out of her?  Yeah, dude.  Shit happens, motherfucker.  Shit happens, man.  Wow.  You got that one right in.  Oh, damn, man.  Well, make your hair better.  That's a great shot.  It's the hair.  You know what, though?  It's the thin hair on the top of her head.  It's her thin wig.  Yeah, yeah, that thin little...  She needs more hair.  She looks like the doll from Trilogy of Terror.  I remember that, motherfucker.  With the knife.  Are you fucking serious, dude? 
[01:59:30]  Like, if I could fucking...  Trilogy of Terror doll.  Punch out Trilogy of Terror doll.  Fucking come up with that reference.  Holy shit.  That's the same head.  That is one of the fucking best old movies.  I don't know that one.  I remember being a kid watching that and just being petrified.  Wait, but Karen Black?  Oh, yeah.  I don't think I saw it.  I never saw that either.  Dude, there it is.  Wow.  I saw Karen Black on a plane once.  She still looked pretty good.  I would fuck Karen Black just...  She still looked...  To say that you fucked Karen Black. 
[02:00:00]  She's that ugly, gorgeous.  She's kind of like Carly Simon.  It's something about her that's just...  Old steam shovel jaw.  Yeah, it's just something about...  Oh, this girl's...  We might have the best reference of the day.  Dave in South Carolina might have it.  We've been taking these calls all morning long.  I say Easter Island had his fucking...  Yeah, that hits it.  All right, Dave in South Carolina.  Hey, call her old underside of a Stingray head.  All right, it does kind of look like that.  Oh, shit.  From a shark's point of view. 
[02:00:30]  A shark's point of view head.  Stingray shark head.  That's not bad.  Oh, God.  How about...  Wait a minute.  How about the tip top of a squid's head?  She's Calamar.  I can't tell him, buddy.  The Grimace.  The Grimace.  Oh, she got it.  Her sense of humor better be a cute man.  Oh, hell yeah.  She's going to have to deal with it.  Because she's going to have a lot of phony people around.  Oh, yeah.  Who are like, oh, my God, I'm glad you're alive.  Thank God, because you know something?  It looks fantastic. 
[02:01:00]  You can't even tell anything happened.  Oh, really?  They should put, like, blue hair on her and then let Buzz Barney try to fucking...  Monsters are such interesting people.  I was just saying, I'm going to put some curlers in your hair and I'll be right back.  Oh, shit.  Monsters are such interesting people.  Such interesting people.  There she is.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[02:01:30]  Okay, Doc.  How the fuck did you find that, Danny?  Danny is the king of the search engine.  I don't even know the name of that monster.  Gossamer.  Gossamer.  Gossamer.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, E-Rock, and Sam.  Jesse Ventura shows up out of nowhere to intimidate all of us.  Yes, Jesse Ventura, after the break, he's a massive man.  And he's coming up on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  We are doing the worst of Opie and Anthony because everyone's on vacation.  Matter of fact, we're doing it and doing it and doing it well. 
[02:02:00]  Very clever.  It's E-Rock and primetime Sam Roberts.  And this involves former governor, former WWE legend, Jesse Ventura.  When Jesse Ventura came in studio, since he was a former wrestler, I asked him to sign  my steel chair.  And I go, you know, it's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Ventura.  Would you mind signing this real quick?  Takes the marker and the chair.  And as he's signing, he goes, I haven't wrestled in 20 years.  And I never used a steel chair.  And he hands it back to me. 
[02:02:30]  And I'm like, look, I didn't need a life story.  Just sign the chair, you know?  Yeah.  You're a wrestler.  Just sign it.  You're just adding to the collection.  Yeah.  It's not like, you know.  But who else out there has a chair with his seat?  You know, that's why I'm special.  That's one of the reasons I'm special.  I have Predator signed.  BFD is what I said.  Okay.  But this bit here is where the Anthony catchphrase now developed.  Yes.  All right.  No, not that.  Thermite paint.  Thermite paint.  He came in to spout out some of his crazy political ideals and other such things. 
[02:03:00]  Anthony, Jim Norton, Opie, and Jesse, the body, the mind, the governor, Ventura, in studio  on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  I actually felt retarded.  Like really retarded.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Very, very busy day today.  In studio, Jesse Ventura.  Yes.  Promoting Don't Start the Revolution Without Me. 
[02:03:30]  On paperback.  Oh, out on paperback.  That's right.  You came around when it was out originally.  Then they make you do it again.  When the paperback comes out, you've got to come out and do all the shows all over again.  And that's part of the obligation of when you write a book.  If it's successful enough and makes it to paperback, you're happy to do it.  Because it means the book was a success if you take it to paper.  And you've got to write extra pages, too, because you've got to give them a little extra, right?  Yep.  So I updated it now because, of course, I wrote the book and the epilogue of the book is complete fiction.  I write fact all the way until the epilogue and then I switched over to fiction without telling you. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, really?  It just becomes a murder mystery.  And I had to kind of remove that because I did a fictional piece saying that martial law, that I and Robert Kennedy Jr. are running for president,  and that martial law is declared here and they suspend because there's an attack of six of our cities and they suspend the elections.  And then I wanted to kill myself in the book, but Dick Russell, the guy who wrote it with me, wouldn't allow it, so I end up in a coma. 
[02:04:30]  Why wouldn't he allow it?  Did he throw it too depressing?  No, he probably wanted to do another book with me, which we're now doing.  So he figured if I could see, I created Jesse Ventura, so I felt I had the right to kill him.  Oh, that's true.  You know, since I created him, the public image of who he is, then who would have the right to kill him other than me?  And that's what I kind of wanted to do because when I moved to Mexico, I had no intention really of going into the public eye anymore.  It was like a getaway to go down there.  Now, obviously, you spend a lot of time down in Mexico, I gather. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  And you enjoy what down there as opposed to being here?  Well, first of all, the weather.  Well, I'll give you that.  You know, you notice that I'm a lot tanner than all you guys are.  Yes.  You guys look pretty pale to me if you need some sun.  But then again, in New York City, the sun's hard to reach you here.  You've got to look straight up just to see the sky.  This is true.  Yep.  And so, but I also, I've taken up surfing.  I used to do a lot of body surfing and boogie boarding, but now I'm trying to make the transition at this late time in my life to board surfing. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  And it's very difficult.  It's a dedication.  I often like to say this.  Surfing is a lifestyle, and you must be completely dedicated to it.  But imagine if you were that dedicated to religion, would they call you a religious bum?  Surf bum.  No, they call us bums.  You're a surf bum.  I don't like that connotation because it's a dedication and a lifestyle.  It's a, like, like I tell people, here's, here's my life in Mexico. 
[02:06:00]  I can tell it to you in one sentence.  I wake up every morning with nothing to do, and when I go to bed at night, I'm half done.  You can't, but you can't compare surfing to religion because of the connotation.  Surfing has done nothing but commit horrific acts and violence all over the world and murder people in its name.  Oh, yeah.  And religion don't do that.  Hey, no one's ever been murdered over religion.  What needs to be said about Mexico, you're off the grid.  You don't own a cell phone.  You're an hour from pavement, and you're an hour from electricity. 
[02:06:30]  Wow.  But you pedal a bike.  And I went from the governor's residence to that, imagine.  Is it a nice house at least?  Oh, yeah, beautiful home.  Yeah.  Yeah, and the taxes are marvelous down there.  I bet.  No, you know what my taxes are?  I have a three-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath with a casita on the back.  I have my own swimming pool, 30 of my own palm trees, and it's all encased in a wall thing, a two-and-a-half car garage.  My property taxes down there are $400 a year.  Wow. 
[02:07:00]  Wow.  And get this.  Now, here's the better part about it.  They get it, and we don't.  And I'll state it this way.  At least in Minnesota.  Now, I can't speak for all the states, but I'll speak for the one I govern.  In Minnesota, the government and taxation, they penalize good behavior and reward bad.  Case in point, your home.  If you buy your home, fix it up and make it better, like a good citizen, right?  How do they reward you?  You pay more.  You pay more, right? 
[02:07:30]  So by using their analogy, you should buy the house, let it go to shit, be the worst house on the block.  Then they'll reward you.  You'll pay less.  You know something?  Now, do you know how it works?  I agree with Jesse.  Yeah, absolutely.  Do you know how it works in Mexico?  This is embarrassing.  We should be embarrassed up here.  Do you know how property taxes work down there?  There, they reward good behavior.  Your property taxes are due in March.  If you agree and pay them in January, they knock off 20%.  If you pay them in February, they knock off 10%. 
[02:08:00]  March is normal, and then the fines start.  Well, I pay mine on January 28th.  Of course, February is a shortened month.  So in 30 days, I'm getting 20% on my money.  Tell me where I can do that legally.  Now, we should be embarrassed that their system is so much superior to ours.  Down there, they reward good behavior.  As far as, yes, that goes.  You pay early.  You pay early.  You're rewarded.  As far as that goes, you're very true. 
[02:08:30]  You're very right.  I agree with that.  But there are some downsides.  Oh, certainly.  Of living in, well, maybe not living in, and especially you.  I mean, you obviously have the means to buy something nice down there.  There are a lot of impoverished people down there.  Oh, absolutely.  But the thing that's good about it, when you go to Mexico, it's understood the government's corrupt.  See, we're on an ego trip up here.  We kind of like to think our government's not.  I got news for you, people. 
[02:09:00]  We're as corrupt as any Mexican government.  It's just that they're open about it.  Down there, you know it.  By the way, I have a get-out-of-jail-free card.  I've been pulled over twice by the federales, you know, the federal police, where they kind of hold you up for money.  All I do is pull out my governor's ID and say, I know Presidente Fox and Presidente Colteron.  You just have a warning.  Go ahead.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I've done it twice.  I bet that word.  Two times.  You worry about crime down there because Giuliani didn't even want to go without his own security. 
[02:09:30]  Do you have security with you?  Never.  No?  I'm safer where I'm at.  Are you kidding me?  I've seen old women walking along the roads where I live.  I'm in far more danger in Minneapolis, Minnesota than I am in Mexico.  Where the danger is in Mexico is the borders.  And why?  Well, let's go back in history.  Who created the border towns?  We did.  The United States.  We created Tijuana, Nueva Laredo, Nogales, and all them crappy, but we're on Sirius Radio, right? 
[02:10:00]  You curse.  So I can curse.  Yeah.  We created all those shitholes, right?  Do you know how?  The prohibition of alcohol.  When we prohibited alcohol, everybody that wanted to drink went over the border to Mexico to drink.  Well, there came the prostitutes.  There came all the bullshit.  Now, the same holds true today.  You have violence at the border.  I remember.  Remember?  We all remember the Virginia Tech murders.  Yeah.  Sure.  Okay. 
[02:10:30]  Do you know what the headlines were that day in the Mexico papers?  It said USA 33, Mexico 20.  It was like a sports score because on that same day, Mexico lost 20 of their people at the border.  The difference is ours only happens once a decade, like Virginia Tech.  Theirs is a daily thing.  And why?  Because of the illegality of drugs and the prohibition.  If we want to stop all the killing, then stop the prohibition.  It seems to me in our country, we're more fearful of marijuana than murder because we're condoning. 
[02:11:00]  We're prohibiting marijuana, which is causing all the murders.  Is it marijuana, though, or the cocaine traffickers are the ones that tend to be really violent?  It's all.  It's all of them because it's all lumped together with the cartels.  So would you want to legalize cocaine also and all drugs?  Well, when you speak legalized, let's remember, I think marijuana should be treated identical to liquor.  Absolutely.  Because I'll tell you, in fact, it's a lesser of a drug. 
[02:11:30]  Of course.  Because how many kids do we hear at college who binge drink every year and die?  Yeah.  We hear about it every year.  Yet you can't smoke pot and die immediately.  Now, you might die in 40 years from cancer, maybe, from inhaling the smoke, but it's not going to kill you that night.  There isn't enough weed in the world that could kill you in one night.  It's also a personal choice you're making, too.  If you want to smoke it and take the risk of cancer, you should be able to do it.  Absolutely.  Yeah, cigarettes are available.  Now, so to me, let's bring... 
[02:12:00]  I think Franklin Roosevelt said it at the end of Prohibition of Alcohol, and I think it's a great quote.  He said...  I can't feel my legs?  No, no, no, not quite.  He said, we can no longer afford to prohibit alcohol anymore.  I say you switch alcohol and marijuana now and say we can no longer afford to prohibit marijuana anymore.  Right.  I saw, you know those little stores in L.A. where they sell the medicinal if you've got a script?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Medical marijuana, yeah.  I saw a story where they went into the guy, now it's all prescription, and it was a guy 
[02:12:30]  in a wheelchair, runs a little shop about as big as your studio right here.  And they asked him, they said, how much did you pay with prescription-only pot in sales  tax to the state of California last year?  You know what he said?  300 grand.  Wow.  Now, if it was legal like liquor, he would be saying a million.  Now, in these economic times, isn't it smart to get a new revenue source?  Schwarzenegger's actually saying that, though.  You, in a way, agree. 
[02:13:00]  I think Schwarzenegger's kind of toying with that idea.  Absolutely.  So you actually agree with all that.  He's in a desperate spot right now.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Our whole country's in a desperate spot.  Apparently.  Wouldn't it be smart?  How great would it be that marijuana saves this country?  Well, it won't save it, but it's one of the building blocks.  If you can get more revenue coming, one thing is not going to solve the economy.  You're going to have to have about 30 things to solve it.  But this could be one.  How much more of the Predator cast is for legalizing pot?  I would say all of them. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  Just checking.  I would say Sonny would have to be for it.  Sonny Landum.  I wouldn't think Sonny would have no problem with it.  Sure.  I don't think Carl and Bill would have a problem with it.  Bill Duke and Carl Weathers.  Seems like he might poke a little bit.  Sure.  Or Shane Black, who wrote Lethal Weapon.  I don't think he'd have a problem with it.  I thought I was a little curious on that one.  Now.  Elpedia.  Now, I don't know.  Elpedia Carrillo.  The Mexican girl.  I don't know what Elpedia's spot would be on it.  Get to the chopper.  Very good. 
[02:14:00]  I like that.  I've seen it so many times.  Get to the chopper.  Now, we've got to get into something, because I'm agreeing with you on everything you've said so far.  So far, so good.  All right.  But now there are a couple of issues, Jesse, where I think we part ways a little bit.  And what might that be?  Well, that would be what I heard he's talking about on Larry King about Guantanamo and the insurgents, the victims, the tortured people, the bad guys, the terrorists, the poor guys.  Whatever you want to, you know, depending on which side, whatever they're being called this day.  Muslims.  Well, we only seem to waterboard Muslims. 
[02:14:30]  Well, when they're the only ones crashing in the building.  Oh, not true.  Well.  Well, Timothy McVeigh and Nichols, why didn't we waterboard them?  Well, we kind of knew they did it.  Yeah, but many people felt there were more people involved.  Shouldn't we have waterboarded them to find out?  But we can't, can we?  Because it's against the law.  We could execute one of them.  They were covered under the Constitution of the United States of America.  Right.  But the insurgents, the victims, whatever you want to call them.  They should be, too.  But they are not.  Yes, they are.  They are.  Our country is our country. 
[02:15:00]  But it's.  You go by the rule of, if you don't follow the rule of law when it's convenient, you must also follow it when it's inconvenient.  Torture is illegal.  But there's a difference.  No, there is not.  There is a difference between people, American citizens protected by the Constitution, and wartime prisoners that are.  That are protected.  Not protected.  By what?  The Geneva Convention.  Exactly.  But, but they don't qualify for that either.  Only because that's what the torture people are using as semantics to get away with it. 
[02:15:30]  It's just like when they call it enhanced interrogation.  Right.  Oh, what a neat word to come up with that you can substitute for torture.  Well, it is a shame how many people have.  I've been waterboarded.  I heard.  I know that.  Yeah, I heard.  And it's torture.  Yep.  John McCain has been waterboarded.  He said, isn't it ironic that the guys who have been waterboarded and the guys who have actually served their country are opposed to the torture,  and it's all these pukes like Dick Cheney, who got five deferments from the Vietnam War. 
[02:16:00]  However, he's all for it and creates it, because he never had to put his ass on the line, did he?  Shouldn't it be on the table?  Shouldn't that be on the table, at least as a threat for information?  No, because the information's fraudulent.  That's why I made the quote, you give me Dick Cheney a waterboard in an hour, and I'll have him confess to the Tate murders.  I understand.  Because when you're being tortured, you will say whatever it is to stop the torture. 
[02:16:30]  So there's no credibility to what?  Why do you think it's not allowed in the courts?  But the threat of a torture, let me tell you, you go public.  Then we steep to their level, don't we?  I'm not saying, I'm not even saying torture.  What's next?  Should we lop some heads off?  I'm not even saying torture them, but I'm saying to publicly say, this is what we're never going to use, takes a tool away.  It's called the tool of fear, not actually torturing, let's say. 
[02:17:00]  Believe me, I'm not even for that, but I'm talking with you here.  I know.  Why would a president, or anybody else for that matter, say, we're never going to use this?  It's a bad thing to tell the opposition what you're taking off the table, regardless if you use it or not.  Because that puts us above them.  But by being above them.  And if we stoop to their level, we're no better than they are.  But, you know something, we are.  No, we're not.  When we bomb places, we have to make sure there are strategic strikes. 
[02:17:30]  No, we don't.  We have bombs that go or miss.  Are you kidding me?  How many civilians you think have died in Afghanistan and Iraq from our supposed surgical strikes?  Because war isn't perfect, unfortunately.  That's right.  We can't just kill the bad guys.  That's why it's war and it's bad.  And that's why we shouldn't be in either one of them.  But I'm saying, Afghanistan, too, we shouldn't be in?  No.  Why?  Al-Qaeda are the people they could have turned him over.  Excuse me.  We went to war with Al-Qaeda because they supposedly would not turn over Bin Laden. 
[02:18:00]  That's all they did.  Al-Qaeda, that's all they did.  We said to Al-Qaeda, turn over Bin Laden.  Al-Qaeda said no.  And that's why we're fighting them.  The Taliban, you mean?  Yeah, or the Taliban.  Excuse me, the Taliban.  Yeah, they were the head muckety mucks, lopping off heads and doing whatever they do.  But don't you think that somebody had to be held responsible?  And I know some of your theories on 9-11. 
[02:18:30]  They're not theories.  They're questions.  In our country, you're not allowed to ask them anymore.  You have theories, though.  No, no.  I have questions.  I have questions.  That's all.  Not theories.  I have questions.  Your take on what happened is not the official line.  Right.  You feel...  Well, I follow what Thomas Jefferson said.  Dissension is the greatest form of patriotism.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, no.  So I dissent.  I question my government.  I agree with everyone's right to do that.  Absolutely.  But why does everyone get angry when you question 9-11? 
[02:19:00]  People get angry at you when they call you names.  And they do all this stuff.  And all I do, there's things about 9-11 that are very peculiar to me.  That whole day was a bit peculiar.  Like, and I do have a background, I think, in demolition.  I was trained by the best guys we have in the country.  And when I look at those buildings and I see how the cement was pulverized to powder,  what type of energy could cause that? 
[02:19:30]  Not a simple fall.  Well, that wasn't quite a simple fall.  Yeah.  They said one floor pancaked into the other and down they went.  A lot of weight.  Well, how would that pulverize 900 tons of cement into dust?  People are questioning, I think, because you do have the demolition background,  the Navy SEAL background.  How come it was, like, on September 12th or 13th?  Like, you kind of came out a couple years later.  And I think that's what people are questioning.  Like, there have been so many theories about it before.  Because at the time I was governor, I didn't have time to question it.  When you're governor, that's a full-time job, believe me. 
[02:20:00]  And so it was after I got, you know what made me question 9-11?  Here's what did it.  After I got out of office and Bush said we're going to invade Iraq.  I stepped back and went, Iraq?  Wait a minute.  The 19 guys they told us that did this, there wasn't one Iraqi.  Right.  Why are we going into Iraq?  And that's when I started to question.  I said, ooh, what's the real big picture here?  But how did that make you change your view of the physical?  What's the real big picture here?  But you could question that, but it doesn't have to necessarily tie into 9-11. 
[02:20:30]  Well, what made us go into Iraq?  It could tie into Saddam Hussein trying to kill my daddy.  That's pretty much what I think White Bush...  The point is, all of it wouldn't have happened without 9-11.  That was a catalyst because he was able to use the fear of terrorism and potential threat  of Saddam Hussein, which turned out to be bullshit.  To lie to us.  To lie to us.  I'm not going to disagree.  Right.  That was the weapons.  Big lie.  Big lie.  Well, if they'd lie about that, wouldn't they lie about other things? 
[02:21:00]  Just because I lie to one thing doesn't mean I'm lying about a murder.  I could lie that I stole something.  It doesn't necessarily mean I would lie for something more important.  Well, all right.  Let's go back to my generation.  I'm a Vietnam vet.  Now, I remember when the President Johnson got on TV and told us our boys are floating  in the water for the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which is what got us into the Vietnam War,  where 58,000 of my generation were killed, probably a million Vietnamese killed, who knows 
[02:21:30]  how many.  And they've now come out and said, that wasn't true.  It never happened.  Now, if they would fraudulently build up the Gulf of Tonkin incident to get us to war,  you think they wouldn't fraudulently take us to war again?  In that fashion, I'm not too sure about that.  Really?  In the fashion of taking down two huge, very symbolic buildings, killing a lot of innocent American people, 
[02:22:00]  in that fashion, no.  And the demolition thing, I like to, because you say you're in demolition.  I was trained by the best.  You know what it takes to wire a building that size for demolition.  Not much.  How would you do that in a working building?  Easy.  Let me explain.  When I see them demolish buildings, they're drilling holes.  They're planting.  There's wires.  All right.  Great.  First of all, the World Trade Center had construction going on on a daily basis. 
[02:22:30]  Every time a tenant moved out, they had to redo whatever floor they were on.  And I learned this from guys that worked there.  They said construction was an everyday thing.  Construction workers would walk in and out all the time.  You want to know how to do it?  Be the UPS man.  Show up with your brown truck.  You've got access to every floor.  You can carry boxes up to any floor.  Who's going to ever question?  You're the UPS guy.  You've got enough explosives covertly to take down two buildings that are 100 stories tall. 
[02:23:00]  Do you know anything about the modern demolition?  I've seen many documentaries.  Do you know what super thermite is?  Do you know what super thermite is?  No, but I assume it would be a very high temperature.  It's a highly explosive demolition that you can put on like painting the walls.  It doesn't become a demo until it dries.  And it can be made into paint. 
[02:23:30]  You could have people painting super thermite right here in the building and they wouldn't even know it.  I would love to see a demonstration of it used to take down pillars of cement.  I can show you super thermite.  Without drilling into the superstructure.  I can show you super thermite.  We just did it for a pilot I'm doing on True Channel.  We showed super thermite simply painted onto I-beam steel and detonated and then burned right through it.  I-beam steel.  Can I ask you a question just about 9-11?  I would almost believe conspiracy theorists. 
[02:24:00]  Well, the government is just a theory.  Let me just ask you.  Why wouldn't they just, to go through all that and go through the planes,  why wouldn't they just bring the buildings down, take two trucks, however they do it, get them into the basement?  If you can bypass the security at the airport, if you can do all that, you can get trucks into the basement,  you somehow make a proclamation that Saddam Hussein has said he is going to attack a major New York City,  that day you drop both buildings, you A, kill a lot more people,  you B, remove almost all of the X factors that can fuck you up, 
[02:24:30]  like a plane not taking you up because of mechanical failure,  and you give the entire American public a galvanizing reason to go into Iraq.  Like, that is so much simpler and so much easier to control.  Why wouldn't they, I mean, if they could, why not something simple?  Why four airplanes and possibly more, and then you leave Zacharias Moussaoui to be tried?  It's embarrassing.  You know, there's a lot of unanswered questions, and that's my point.  Why is it that when you ask questions about 9-11, you're immediately attacked? 
[02:25:00]  Why aren't you allowed to ask a question about it?  If something, if you saw something that you don't understand,  which there are many things I don't understand that day,  why June 1st did George Bush do an executive order changing how we respond to air attacks?  Up until that point, base commanders were left to their discretion whether we sent jets up,  and that happened like 170 times a year, jets would go up in the air. 
[02:25:30]  Yet June 1st, through an executive order,  no jets were allowed to go in the air unless it was cleared through Donald Rumsfeld at the DOD.  So in essence, you could have a stand down simply by Rumsfeld not answering his phone  because no one had permission to go up in the air.  Where was our air defense that day?  Here you had four commercial hijacked airplanes covering two to three, four hours a time,  and we didn't have one jet in the air. 
[02:26:00]  Yet, go back to when, do you remember Payne Stewart, the golfer?  Okay, Payne Stewart took off from Florida in a private plane.  They went up and lost contact.  Within 20 minutes, they had a fighter jet up on the wing.  He said, they're slumped over.  I can't raise them.  They appear to be dead.  He followed them to Nebraska or whatever.  When they didn't hit Omaha, he let them go down.  Well, this was a private plane out of Florida,  and we had a jet up there within 20 minutes.  Here you've got four hijacked planes and not one. 
[02:26:30]  Let's look at the government's theory, and I call theirs a theory, too.  They've never proven any of this.  But, Jesse, you're saying four planes.  Not to interrupt you, but you're saying four planes.  You remember, too.  They were up, and it was very, very quick.  Like, when the one plane went up, a bunch of stuff happened.  A lot of people, the air traffic control wasn't exactly sure what was happening.  And the next thing you know, it's flying to a plane.  Because, ironically, we were holding war games that day.  Now, did the terrorists know this? 
[02:27:00]  And if they did, who leaked it to them?  How did they know to do it on a day when NORAD is running these huge war games  where it would confuse all the air?  Remember the quotes from the air traffic controllers?  Is this real or is this part of the war game?  They didn't know.  Now, that fits bad for us either way.  Because either it was done intentionally  or the terrorists got inside our government  to the point of knowing when we run war games.  So somebody's not doing their job here. 
[02:27:30]  The plot was called Porsche 911, I believe.  So they knew that they were going on September 11th.  So you're taking into account, if the government's involved  and there's war games involved,  bad weather ruins your entire plot.  Like, that's why I don't...  I believe that the 19 guys caught this country with our pants down  and they used lax security.  Well, let me ask this.  How were they able to identify these guys within 24 hours  and yet not able to stop them?  They had pictures on TV yet.  They showed us pictures.  Because they didn't try to hide themselves. 
[02:28:00]  They were on the manifest.  Well, the other...  Their names were on the manifest.  Really?  Who's seen the manifest?  The government won't release the manifest.  When have you seen them?  Well, I haven't seen the manifest.  No one has.  No one has.  The government won't release the manifest.  Why?  All right, let's go to the Pentagon.  The Pentagon has over 200 cameras that run 24-7.  Why did the government confiscate all those cameras  and why are we not allowed to see the plane hit?  All you see is this little flash that they allowed you to see. 
[02:28:30]  Yet the Pentagon has cameras all over it.  And how was that plane able to circle for 40 minutes  in a no-fly zone and not be shot out of the air?  Question.  And then it ties in.  When Cheney was down in the bunker  and Mineta, the transportation secretary,  testified to this in open 9-11.  He said a kid walked in and said,  Mr. Vice President, the plane's 50 miles out.  Mr. Vice President, the plane's 30 miles out. 
[02:29:00]  Mr. Vice President, the plane's 10 miles out.  Do the orders still stand?  Mineta tested that.  And Cheney snapped around and said,  of course they still stand.  Have you heard anything contrary?  Well, what orders are we talking about here?  And if he knew and was being a report that this plane was approaching Washington, D.C.,  why weren't buildings being evacuated?  Why wasn't it being shot out of the air?  A lot of questions like that. 
[02:29:30]  Right, they did handle it terribly, but I don't think...  It was handled horribly.  That's implying that the Vice President and the President know a plane is being crashed,  and they're going, well, if the plane's on schedule to hit the Pentagon,  that doesn't make sense.  Now, here, the plot thickens.  Now, Bush was down at that school, right, talking to the kids?  Right.  And remember the seven minutes he sat there frozen in the classroom?  All right.  The Secret Service is under the Department of Justice.  They don't even take orders from the President.  If they feel the President's in danger, they whisk him to safety. 
[02:30:00]  Now, the President's trip to Florida to that school was a photo op.  So it was well-documented he was going to be in that school.  Card comes up to him and tells him a second plane hit, we're under attack.  Now, planes are flying into buildings.  Two of them have done it now.  Why did the Secret Service allow Bush to sit there for seven minutes  when, for all purposes, a plane could have been bearing down on that school  at the very moment that he was in there? 
[02:30:30]  Who would know?  We're under attack from flying planes.  They knew he was there.  He should have been whisked out of that room immediately.  But it was almost like they knew.  I just think we had this perception that we were protected a lot better  than we actually were.  We always had this perception that there were missiles on top of the White House  and things would happen if something like this ever happened.  But you know something?  We just were not as prepared as we would have liked to have been. 
[02:31:00]  So a memo on August 6th that said the exact thing that was going to happen  while our president was vacationing in Crawford, Texas,  the memo of August 6th said exactly Osama bin Laden's planning to hijack planes  and fly them into buildings.  I can tell you something.  Had I been the president, 9-11 might not have happened  because I would have responded to that memo.  I wouldn't have gone on vacation to Crawford.  The other investigator that went down to the flight school 
[02:31:30]  and spoke with people that said this gentleman is trying to fly a plane.  It's very suspicious.  He doesn't fly very well.  He's not concerned with the landing.  That, to me, is evidence also that this guy is a Middle Eastern gentleman  that was flying a plane and pulling up red flags.  Let's look at the actual hijackers.  Now, Osama bin Laden is a purist Muslim  who goes by the old traditional Muslim, we'll all agree to that, right? 
[02:32:00]  Whether you agree with what he believes in.  What do you mean the purist?  Purist.  He's a Muslim who believes in the faith.  Like, we're the infidels, we should be out of their country and all this.  I think Al-Zawahari is more the strict religious guy than he is.  Okay, well, both of them then, whatever.  But these guys that hijacked, they were not strict to the faith.  They were going to stripper bars.  They followed him.  They were following orders, whether they're...  But if you're going to go die and you believe in Allah 
[02:32:30]  and you believe in the purity and the sanctity of the religion  and you're now going to die, wouldn't you live cleanly?  They're not very rational if you're going to take a plane  and fly it into a building, so...  They're flying civilians into a building.  But you're not listening to me.  These guys don't fit.  They perfectly fit.  No, they don't.  They were fanatics, perhaps not as religious as you would think they would be  if they're going to fly into buildings,  but you've got to be a little cuckoo to fly into a fucking building 
[02:33:00]  with planes full of people.  So, you know, perhaps they weren't strictly adhering to this Muslim faith.  I would.  If I were a religious person...  Well, if I was that religious...  That's a little loose.  ...and you know you're going to die,  would you want to offend God right before you die?  I wouldn't think so.  Well, you can't obviously say what they looked at.  Sure you can, because they behaved that way.  Yeah, so they weren't... 
[02:33:30]  See, to me, they're not the followers of Bin Laden and them  because of their behavior.  I want a question for you to this.  9-11 was 75% successful, according to what they wanted to do.  The passengers overtook that final plane.  Once they all knew for a fact it was happening, they overtook it.  I don't believe that either.  I know you don't, but I mean...  Cell phones don't work that high then.  But they were low.  They weren't flying at 30,000 feet.  But let's just say...  Yeah, they were.  Let's say for the sake of argument that the passengers attacked,  if the pilots are not trained to open that door and negotiate,  if those doors are locked and that the first sign of trouble,  they allow that woman's throat to be cut and they do not open the doors, 
[02:34:00]  9-11 doesn't happen.  All right.  Here's another one for you.  You've got four experienced pilots that were flying these planes,  like the guy that flew the Pentagon plane, Burlingame, former Top Gun.  Tough as you can get.  Now, they have a thing on all commercial planes where all you've got to do is punch in some numbers  and it's a code that you're being hijacked.  Why did none of the four planes, none of them, that number was never punched in?  Probably because they were smart the way they did it.  They would attack the stewardess and the pilots were trained to open the door and negotiate, 
[02:34:30]  which is a horrible thing.  But they still would hit that before they would do anything.  It doesn't require any words.  All that does is send out to everyone who needs to know we're being hijacked.  None of the four planes did that.  Why?  Well, didn't the stewardess open the door?  And a guy like Burlingame, guys that knew him said he would never give his plane up.  He would die first.  So then how did they get it?  I don't know why they didn't.  I don't know.  He might have died first.  Yeah, but he was a tough guy.  He was a karate guy.  He was top and self-defense, all this stuff. 
[02:35:00]  When you've got a guy with a box cutter to a girl's throat, perhaps,  then the guy isn't going to charge in and start fighting, knowing that somebody's life is threatened.  You've got to look.  In hindsight, if you think these planes are going to fly into the ground and everything like that,  you're going to do whatever you have to do.  Okay, here's what we have to believe then, and which all of you do,  that 19 Islamic hijackers armed with box cutters defeated our multi-billion dollar air defense system 
[02:35:30]  that the Soviets couldn't.  And the threat of a bomb.  And the threat of a bomb.  The Soviets couldn't do it.  But these 19 guys, all while taking orders and conspiring with a bearded guy in a cave in Afghanistan.  Yeah, a billionaire.  A billionaire who has funds and who has a network of people.  He's not some broke guy.  That's right.  He's a construction billionaire.  Yeah, and in fact, you're correct there, because his brother Salem,  he helped bail out George Bush on one of his horrible business ventures. 
[02:36:00]  They're being tied in.  I don't even disagree.  Oil families are a very small group of people in this world.  And George Bush is part of it.  Oh, he is.  He absolutely is.  But he didn't orchestrate in 9-11.  Say we dislike him as much as you want.  I'm not saying he did.  No, I know.  I'm just saying that if they didn't orchestrate it, I believe that they didn't do much to stop it.  The 19 guys caught the U.S. with their pants down because they took, first of all, they had the threat of a bomb.  What threat of a bomb?  They said they had a bomb.  People were calling on their cell phones saying that these Muslim guys or whatever they said or Arabic guys have hijacked us. 
[02:36:30]  And this is coming from people who were on the plane, and they said they have a bomb.  That's how they stopped a mutiny from the passengers.  How did they get the bomb through security?  They didn't.  There was no bomb.  Exactly.  And you'd be that stupid on the plane?  Wouldn't you if you were on the plane?  I would think.  Jesse, you're different.  You're not a businessman on your way to L.A. to do something.  No, I'm a governor.  Nah, but you're also a fucking wrestler and a Navy SEAL.  You think differently than the average citizen. 
[02:37:00]  No, I don't.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  Regular guys aren't six foot five that can throw somebody through the window.  Pre-9-11, your mindset, if you're a regular average Joe flying, was if some fucking shenanigans happen, I'm going to sit in my seat, shut up, and hope we land, and they, you know, deal with this problem.  Because it had never happened.  Because it hadn't happened.  If they knew right off the bat that they were flying into buildings, you would do everything you could.  Every old lady would be scratching frigging eyeballs out.  So that's, I think, the mindset now is what you're thinking. 
[02:37:30]  But it's hindsight.  The pilots would have done something.  You tell me they couldn't have dipped that plane.  They knew they were going to be flown into buildings.  They would have dipped that plane and dropped everybody.  They would have lowered the air pressure.  If you want anything, but...  No, it had never happened.  You negotiated, they would ask for the freedom of political prisoners, and you would land.  No one had ever flown passenger planes into buildings.  And the shitty intelligence, the lack of communication between the FBI and the CIA, that was all terrible.  That was all terrible, but that doesn't mean that it was a conspiracy by the U.S. government.  You've got your ideas on it and questions, like you said.  I'm not saying it is. 
[02:38:00]  I'm just saying that what troubles me in this country is that on this issue, you're not allowed to talk about it.  But you are.  No, without weight, without people insulting you.  This is Governor Jesse Ventura, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  Worst of Opie and Anthony, you think it can't get worse, but it does, because you break out some of the Real Rock tapes.  What are the Real Rock tapes?  Eric, please explain for everybody.  Real Rock tapes are the TV show that ONA used to do when they were serving time in Boston. 
[02:38:30]  Real Rock TV was the show.  Yes.  It was terrible.  Cheesy bits.  And here's some of those bits coming up after the break on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yes, Eric.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Is it?  Yes.  Where are we?  We are hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  No, but where are we right now?  Right now, we are sitting in the studio hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  No.  As of this airing, where are we?  Hmm.  I don't know.  Where are you?  I am at a bed and breakfast with my lovely wife. 
[02:39:00]  Doing what?  Having sex.  Ew.  Ew, ew, ew.  Anyway, so, um, Real Rock tapes.  You know the Real Rock tapes?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, this is one of them.  We won't give you the details you've figured out here on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah, I do remember these.  These are bad.  Who the fuck is listening?  To the worst.  Who's fucking listening?  To the worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, did that make it up?  What, the latest video?  The latest video?  If you want to take a look at it. 
[02:39:30]  No, I don't.  Can you see, guys, I, uh...  Jimmy, Jimmy just got this big twinkle in his eye.  Well, the bit is, we, I've been putting up old videos from when we did a TV show called  Real Rock TV up in Boston.  And I don't know if it's helping or hurting us.  I'm starting to think maybe I should not put these up.  But here's the second video.  One a day.  One a day until the douche chills get so bad that I have to stop this process.  One a day is quite enough.  You know, on Twitter, you can hit that reply thing.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Is it positive reviews so far?  Oh, it's just brutal.  Have your fun, boys and girls.  Yeah.  I don't, I didn't even look at it.  And I was getting, like, reviews.  Twittered to me.  Just saying, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Pretty bad stuff, huh?  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  I'll set this clip up.  First of all, the turkey bowling clip was supposed to go up.  Right.  With hot chicks and stuff. 
[02:40:30]  What happened?  I think it could have been okay.  I think we could have saved face on that clip.  But the video uses Take the Skinheads Bowling, that old song, that old dumb song that no one  downloads or cares about.  And because of that, there's a copyright infringement thing that YouTube's really into these days.  Well, for a while now.  So, you know, I can't, I can't get it up there.  It sucks.  Hmm.  If they know you're using a piece of music, they deny your videos now.  Denied?  Well, they've been doing it for a while, which sucks. 
[02:41:00]  Because it was on TV.  We're just basically rebroadcasting this.  A load of crap.  And that's a much better clip than this.  So last minute, we kind of, like, scrambled and put this one up.  Today's clip should be a lot better, I'm thinking.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  This one's good, though.  So basically, you know, we're such cool TV hosts, Anthony.  Yeah.  That we're hosting the show from my car, just driving around and causing all sorts of shenanigans. 
[02:41:30]  Didn't we goof on Rocco about doing this with the rock bus?  Well, we didn't steal my own car, though.  Well, I know, but, but why were we doing this?  Why were we broadcasting from the car?  I guess it should be noted that, you know, we had a radio show to do.  And then, like.  Here comes the excuses.  And then we had, remember Ian?  Yes, of course.  And then Ian's like, what do you guys want to do on Real Rock TV this week?  We're like, we don't even know what we want to do on our show.  That's true.  So it was always like, it really was an afterthought, like, all right, how about this? 
[02:42:00]  We'll, we'll film some, some shit from our, you know, my car.  Yeah.  You can say that again.  So, so this starts with Anthony acting retarded.  I'm really surprised Bruce Mittman allowed this on the fine TV show.  Uh-huh.  Because you're acting like a retard.  You're, you're banging your head on the glass, the passenger side window.  Why was I doing that?  And, because there's, we're at a red light and there's some, like, you know, housewife 
[02:42:30]  next to us.  Oh, I was trying to, like, freak her out.  And you did freak her out.  All right, good.  And we'll start with this.  Jimmy, when you want us to stop the tape, you just raise your hand and point to Danny.  And this is basically just showing you what nuts Opie and Anthony were off the air.  Like.  Crazy.  Like, it doesn't stop here.  No, no, no.  All right, Jimmy, here you go.  The first look at the video.  You didn't see this?  You got to watch.  I did.  Oh, you did see this?  Yes, I did.  I haven't.  I did. 
[02:43:00]  I haven't, so I'm ready to deuce chill out.  Oh, no, this is good.  How many problems you got?  Oh, this is good.  How many problems you got with this clip, Jimmy?  None.  It was really funny.  I mean, I was like, these guys were, like, when did these guys, like, kind of slow down?  It was, like, obviously 24 hours of craziness back then.  What an asshole.  All right, here we go.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Good copy.  Ah!  Lady! 
[02:43:30]  Ah!  Lady!  Ah!  Ah!  Look at that.  Jesus.  Look at that.  It's weird.  Racing away.  Ah.  Fun with Opie and Anthony.  This is what we do when we're not on the radio.  Pause it.  Fun with Opie and Anthony.  This is what we do when we're not on the radio.  Fun with Opie and Anthony.  I was groaning and banging my head against the window to try to upset the woman that was 
[02:44:00]  next to us at a light.  Yeah.  Yep.  That's fun.  Do you?  I think fun.  I don't even remember doing this.  I don't remember doing this at all.  At all.  What do you think, Jimmy?  That's the same thing Barkoff was saying this morning in Boston.  No recollection of doing this.  I don't remember this.  There was a...  Oof.  Oof.  It's very busy.  It's not particularly well shot.  It's in the back seat.  Like a guy is just holding a video camera. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  And you can tell there was no take two.  Oh, really?  No, no.  There's not one for safety, as they say.  No, we don't have...  Let's do one more for safety.  We don't have time for take twos.  All right.  Here comes the second part of the video.  Yeah.  Radio, by the way.  Real Rock TV on the road.  That's great.  It's out for the poll.  Stop it.  Don't be an idiot.  Honestly.  Hey, on the Real Rock TV show tonight, we got a live performance from Power Man 5000.  That's Rob Zombie's brother on lead vocals. 
[02:45:00]  Hey, you want to see us break a law for Real Rock TV?  Get the red light on the TV.  Uh-oh.  Watch.  Oh, my God.  There's a red light now.  Whee!  We got down set.  You got down set from the Middle East, right?  Crazy.  What?  The camera cut right there is horrendous.  Probably because we stopped short and didn't go through it.  And made sure we didn't break the law.  Why would the camera stop there and not show us going through the light completely?  It shows you going up under the red light, and then all of a sudden, it cuts.  I do remember we actually went through the red light. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  We did.  But I was so amazed and stunned.  Whoa!  But this is, you know, we've been dealing with management and lawyers for a long time.  I do believe they didn't want to show us breaking some law on a TV show.  So they cut it out.  So then we would get arrested, or we'd have some kind of problem.  It's like, whatever.  We'll deal with going through a red light.  I'll take the points.  I think you're right.  If it makes for good TV. 
[02:46:00]  But they're like, no, no, no.  It makes for good TV.  Yeah.  To be arrested for this.  Let's cut it right before you officially break the law.  That's probably what the station was just telling you guys to be polite.  They were probably like, this is horrible.  Yeah.  Like, just tell them it's illegal.  Maybe they'll drop the bitch.  But it's funny.  Like, that was the big law.  It was like the little slow dryer through the red light.  It was like, woo!  Did it.  All right.  Here we go.  Hit it again.  And we got a Star Wars party, and Rocco, I think, is doing something with the Monster Truck 
[02:46:30]  show, man.  Yeah.  All right?  Is that a cop?  Man.  Yeah.  I want to comment about my man.  A Star Wars party.  What's a Star Wars party?  I don't remember.  I don't remember a Star Wars party.  Maybe it was the morning show.  It had to be.  Those geeks.  We were, like, cross-promoting, saying what Rocco's going to be doing.  Yeah.  And I said, man.  Man.  Can we hear the man again?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Say a beer.  Dr. Beeper.  Star Wars party, and Rocco, I think, is doing something with the Monster Truck show, man. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  All right?  Is that a cop?  Check out the show.  We got to go.  That's true.  I wish that would have happened.  This is going great.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  I was only joking.  Did you see that, jerk? 
[02:47:30]  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please follow the police.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Yeah.  Is the only way to put that.  That's bad.  I can't even.  Does that make you uncomfortable to watch?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm kind of, I'm cringy.  I'm trying to wrap my arms up a little bit around myself to get warm. 
[02:48:00]  People are confused.  I said, I don't remember this at all, and then I remember the red light thing, but all  of a sudden, the red light thing came into, I remember that they didn't want us to officially  get in trouble.  They wanted us to be edgy, but not officially break the law on the TV show.  Horrible.  You're actually going.  Just the crap we've been dealing with forever.  Yes, Jimmy.  And it's actually going like, you know, like, oh, no, the cops, like, you're like making  it like it's a crazy ending and what's going to happen.  Right. 
[02:48:30]  Because I didn't know.  We're screwed.  Oh, we're screwed.  The beauty is that Anthony gets pulled over every other month now.  Of course.  See?  See?  See?  We're edgy.  See?  See?  I don't film it.  That's when my voice gets higher.  See?  Oh, God.  So what happened?  Did the cops pull you over?  Oh, yeah.  It was a big to-do, Jim.  Oh, boy, yeah.  Big to-do.  Just spent the night in jail, and Bruce Midman had to bail us out.  Yeah.  There was no cop.  You should have saved yourself like Charles Stewart.  What was with the friggin', just, the bullshit we would do? 
[02:49:00]  We were just happy to be there.  Oh, completely.  That was part of our transitional period.  It really was.  You know.  God, thank God.  We had to, like, find our way.  I like when you go, it's Rob Zombie's brother's band.  I think Ant goes, like, I think you say that, and Ant goes, yeah.  Like, the one you act like, yeah, that's enthusiastic.  Well, Power Man 5000 was pretty, they had a little thing going.  One back then, they did all right.  It's kind of funny to hear what bands you're introing on some of these clips, you know? 
[02:49:30]  It's like, hey, and here's, what was that band?  It's Butt Trumpet or something.  Oh, you're ugly.  And we'll hear from Butt Trumpet in a little bit.  Watching these old shows, there is band after band after band that is no longer around.  It's just not around.  Bands like Reach Around.  Hey.  Remember the band Reach Around?  We'll be hearing from Brother Kane.  Oh, remember Brother Kane?  Brother Kane.  He was supposed to be the next big blues guy.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:50:00]  Happened there.  So that's today's clip, Jimmy.  Not as good as yesterday's.  We'll get a doozy for today.  Oh, Lulu.  Maybe Sam could, like, preview what he's thinking of putting up there for me today.  God, why not just put us in gay porno?  It'll be less embarrassing.  What part makes you go, ugh?  My man kills me.  Every reaction I have is just, yeah.  Do you like the retard thing you were doing, though?  That wasn't that bad.  You know what? 
[02:50:30]  I don't think it was TV worthy.  It might be funny if you're in your car and the woman, it's working, and you're getting  a reaction from her, scaring her, perhaps.  Well, Sam ran in, so he must have something good.  Well, you know, you guys didn't stop the craziness there when you were driving.  No?  We're not doing another driving bit, are we?  Did we do, like, I think, a drive-thru thing?  Yeah.  What did we do at the drive-thru?  Well, OB decided to go up to the drive-thru and ask, just for a piece of cheese. 
[02:51:00]  Okay.  He's like, well, why?  Why?  Jimmy just woke up.  Just for a piece of cheese.  Yep.  He said he wants just the cheese, no burger.  Well, wow.  Now, what did the drive-thru person say?  Well, he also said, and no ketchup on it.  I did not do that.  Find another clip. 
[02:51:30]  I refuse to allow that up there today.  And then they gave you a piece of cheese.  Yeah.  And then Ant said, Ant said.  I thought I probably said something.  You were hoping you skated.  Great.  I was hoping he would just say, the end, and walk out.  But no.  When I hear Ant said, I get scared.  And when you want to tap out, you give me a call, and I tap out for this bit.  Because I can't even look at the replies, the comments.  Yeah.  Although, you guys got to keep them at five stars.  As soon as I see those stars drop, bit over. 
[02:52:00]  Bit over.  Yeah.  But they gave you the cheese.  Yeah.  And Ant said, ooh, I get half of the slice of cheese.  Ah, of the slice of cheese.  We're blamed for the bitch.  Are you kidding me?  And Opie said, no, dude.  I got the cheese.  I asked for it.  We're fighting over cheese, man. 
[02:52:30]  And then you go, Anthony.  You go crazy and take it right out of Opie's hand and cackle and laugh as you rip the piece  of cheese in half and enjoy your piece of it.  Of the cheese.  Why would we do this?  Why would we do this?  Look, I can't do this bit anymore.  Why would we do this?  I have found my line.  Wow, that's great.  There's a lot more.  You know what the worst part is?  Just hearing Sam describing it, I can't listen.  No.  To watch that would be so painful. 
[02:53:00]  What other bits have you found?  I don't know.  This is two episodes on all this stuff.  And I still have a stack of tapes.  Dude, I got 20 more tapes at home.  I'm bringing them in slowly.  We're digitizing these things for the first time.  Thank God they're coming into the new millennium with us.  They're being transferred to the digital age where they shall reside forever and ever.  Because the thing about tape is...  Great.  There's like 40 shows. 
[02:53:30]  You guys did 40 of these?  Yeah.  So don't just put up clips.  You don't get any better.  You've got to find the good clips.  The best of the best.  They couldn't get worse.  Yeah, I know.  How long were they?  Half hour?  Yeah.  Any other clips that you've seen?  Nothing I can think of off the top of my head.  The big one is the Tickle Me Elmo bit.  I haven't found that one yet.  It's gold.  No, it's funny.  To this day, people talk about our Tickle Me Elmo bit like it was TV gold.  And I'm sure it wasn't TV gold.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:54:00]  As we look back.  I don't even...  I remember some of the things we did in the bit.  But I don't remember how it all kind of played out.  I...  I...  I'm petrified whenever these go up.  I really enjoy it.  Just call me and I'll tap out.  I'll say it's over.  Because now it's like...  What is it?  Like three o'clock they go up or something like that?  Yeah.  Now we're moving earlier and earlier.  Well, we try to do it at three o'clock.  Yeah.  And then...  Today's because it's part two of the driving bit we'll put up after the show.  You know what it's like?  We'll put it up before we go home from the facility here.  It's like being at school and the bully is going to beat you up at three. 
[02:54:30]  And you're just looking at the clock going, oh, God, no, God, no.  Because you just know an ass-kicking is coming at three.  The movie's called Three O'Clock Blech.  I sit there...  I sit there with the Twitter, with the update, and I just think...  And I just look at it.  And I'm like...  All right.  Yeah.  Update.  And then I just, like, turn off all electronics.  Yeah.  I shut down phones. 
[02:55:00]  Because my phone rings.  You know, because the friends of the show start calling.  Go, hey, hey, I saw the Real Rock clip.  Wow, you guys sucked.  I just love the people that think we're putting them up there to go, look how talented we are.  Oh, God, no.  That's what people don't understand about this radio show.  We're unlike just about every other show.  Yeah.  We allow this.  We'll show you the disgusting, putrid underbelly.  We throw ourselves under the bus.  And then I read comments, and they're like... 
[02:55:30]  I'm like, you don't get it.  I have to say this today.  Dude, that was so lame.  Yeah.  Yes, I know.  Exactly.  I know my hair is horrendous.  I know I look like a Dutch boy thing.  No, what you ought to do is defend it vehemently.  It's great stuff.  Oh, really?  It's very funny, yeah.  Just try to fight our way out of it.  Yeah.  Steven asked for Basher.  I had a fine line today.  Oh.  About this.  He writes, O&A, from happy to be there to angry at everything. 
[02:56:00]  Good for you.  That is true.  Wow.  Oh, there's a typo on the pad data, according to Scott from Hoppock.  It's supposed to read, Real Suck TV.  Thank you.  Bless you.  Bless you.  And someone's suggesting this is everything kids did in high school.  It's not TV worthy.  Yeah, we were cutting edge like jackass before jackass. 
[02:56:30]  And...  No?  Well, yeah, the cheese thing was pretty...  That was like jackass.  Yeah.  See?  Well before jackass.  We were the originators of jackass.  Yeah.  Douchebags, we called it.  We just didn't have the good bits.  Yeah.  We didn't do anything funny or entertaining on there.  So it was...  We asked for a piece of cheese.  Yeah.  Were we introing like, you know, segments in between?  Hey, you asked for the cheese, pal. 
[02:57:00]  I just tried to get half of it.  And you did get half.  Yes.  See, the thing about VHS tape is that over time it degenerates.  Yes, yes.  Now, with this technology, we'll be able to have every episode of Real Rock TV forever  and ever.  It will reside in the digital world as long as there is a digital world.  Somewhere, it will be there.  Yeah.  Have you found a douchey Rocco bit that really brings the whole Rocco thing home?  You know, his is probably going to look like fucking gold compared to our horse shit. 
[02:57:30]  But people are going to be like, yeah, that Rocco was funny.  I'm going to find the best Rocco band.  Yeah.  Find something really funny.  Will look like shit.  And he'll look like a genius.  I can't get over the fact that he looks like a fat Kenny Powers.  Yeah.  He's got the mullet and everything working.  My mullet, dude.  All right.  The next one goes up.  Today, we go early because it's part two of the driving thing.  So...  Right.  Probably before noon today.  Wonderful.  You know why I'm doing that.  Can't wait. 
[02:58:00]  Why?  So they forget about the other one we put up.  Yeah, well, they'll forget by watching something worse.  It's horrible.  All right.  Great.  And you don't...  No other bits that come to mind yet that you're thinking?  Not at the top of the head, but I mean, I have...  The top of your head is a mess, too.  Yeah.  Did you see?  You're ripping me off because did you see from under my hat, all that Afro hair poking out  of the back of the hat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those were the days. 
[02:58:30]  Those were the days, all right.  You know what's sad?  I'm actually paying Sam to do this for me.  Wow.  Why am I paying you to make sure these are on DVD?  Because we need them.  It's archiving, I guess, right?  Yeah, he's archiving some of my stuff.  That's fantastic.  I'm going to give these tapes to the Museum of Television, Radio, and Film.  Oh, are you?  Yes.  As in the what not to do section.  The new what not to do wing.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Worst of Opie and Anthony coming up after the break. 
[02:59:00]  Jimmy shares his little vacation spot known as Devil's Creek in beautiful downtown Edison,  New Jersey.  And it's coming up next on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And probably maybe some of the listeners out there on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You talk about horrific injuries.  My brother Quinn, his best one ever.  We all have one, I guess, like the ones you were just saying. 
[02:59:30]  My dad was changing the twins.  You know, Brett and Quinn are twins on the kitchen counter.  And Brett is like just cool as could be.  And Quinn is screaming bloody murder.  And my dad just cannot figure out what the hell is wrong with this kid, right?  Oh, God.  Remember the, they got rid of these a long time ago, unless you live in a real old house.  Remember like the heating pipes that were exposed?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Was it for the heat or for the hot water?  I'm not really sure.  I think it was the heat.  I think it was the, yeah, the steam heaters. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, but it was a pipe.  Yeah.  That was exposed.  You didn't cover this shit up.  Just a hot steam filled pipe.  Quinn's head was resting nicely against the pipe while my dad was trying to change him.  He's screaming bloody murder and he can't figure it out.  To this day, he can't really get his hair cut too short.  Oh, no, really?  The hair hasn't grown back in that spot since he was a toddler.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Nice hot steam pipe. 
[03:00:30]  Right on the back of the head.  That'll leave a mark.  I cracked my head open good when I was a boy.  Five years old.  There was an older boy.  An older boy who used to make me suck his penis.  It's true.  Same guy.  Wait a minute.  He was older.  Okay, look.  That is where your issues come from.  Why?  Because an older boy made you suck his penis.  Not much older.  You should never be forced to suck someone's penis.  He was older.  He was just manipulating me.  How old was he? 
[03:01:00]  Only a couple years older, but I was scared of him.  I was very scared of him.  Did he have a nice hog?  I don't remember.  I remember.  I swear to God.  Did he come out of your mouth?  No, I don't think he got erections that day.  I was like five.  I was that young.  I was maybe in kindergarten.  Aw.  And I remember he wore a Budweiser bathing suit that smelled like mothballs.  It's a very vivid memory I have.  It smelled like mothballs.  Mothball.  So the smell of mothballs must turn you on.  No, it doesn't turn you on.  But how did he force you?  He would just make me.  It wasn't a violent thing, but he was just older than me, and I was scared of him. 
[03:01:30]  Whatever.  So I remember he walked out of his house, and I just ran because I just thought he was going  to beat me up.  And I just tripped and fell and cracked my head on steps and had to go get stitches.  Because you were trying to avoid blowing.  Avoid, yeah.  I don't know if I was scared of that or if I was scared of him or if he was going to hit  me.  I don't remember why I was so scared of him, but I was.  Wow.  That sucks.  A little Jimmy.  I know, but I got a good head cracking.  Head split open.  A little fruit. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  How did a kid have Budweiser swim trunks, Jim?  I don't remember.  Jim Beck from Florida wants to know.  Well, you don't have to be 21 to buy the swim trunks, Dumbbell.  That's true.  But it seems older than...  That's a good point.  But it does seem older than maybe seven or eight if he had Budweiser swim trunks.  No, but he was young, too.  I believe he was...  I think he was one grade ahead of me or two grades ahead of me.  He wasn't older by a lot.  Was he left back quite a few times?  I'm sure he wasn't the brightest boy.  Gentleman of color? 
[03:02:30]  No, he was a white kid.  I remember he...  I remember he had a brother.  I remember very little about him.  What a creep.  Yeah.  He's the same one that...  What a fucking creep.  He's the same one that urinated in my mouth in the pool.  What?  What?  I never told you that story.  What?  No, but that kind of explains a lot.  Um, no.  This is where it all started, Jimmy.  Holy Jesus.  The Budweiser kid got you going down this road.  I was, uh...  Because you kind of liked that in your adulthood, no? 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, but not from him.  No, I understand.  But it had to start somewhere.  I was, uh, in our public pool, and, um, I guess he was making me go underwater, or I  was going underwater and sucking his penis, but then I would come back up, and he...  I didn't think people could see me because I was underwater.  Like, that's the age I was at.  Like, I thought if I was underwater, no one could see me.  I'm invisible underwater.  I went, I know.  Stupid.  And he fucking whizzed in my mouth, and I came back up.  I'm like, don't do that again.  And he's like, all right.  And then he did it again.  It's kind of like being here, actually.  He said there was a little more respect shown by him. 
[03:03:30]  Exactly.  He treated you better.  That's the same...  That's right around the same time.  Me and my friend Tony Aquino were sitting, uh, on the poolside, and there was a woman,  uh, sitting there with her, uh, bathing suit, and I could see her pubes sticking out the  side.  Yeah.  And I said to Tony, I see hairs.  And she goes, what did you say?  Which I knew, like, was a problem.  I'm like, nothing. 
[03:04:00]  And Tony goes, he said he could see hairs.  And, uh, she looked down, and she realized I could see her pussy hair bulging out.  And she's like, you little fucking pig.  And she screamed at me to leave, and I ran out.  Aw.  So I had very healthy sexual messages growing up.  Now Tani's just finding pictures of women in bikinis with hair sticking out of the side.  Let me see.  That's a little...  I don't think it was that kind of bikini, was it?  No, it wasn't.  It was a regular bikini.  Don't forget, this is very early.  That was probably 1975.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember seeing a girl at a pool party with a crocheted bathing suit. 
[03:04:30]  Oh.  And there were hairs coming, like, out of everywhere.  And I was so excited to look at it.  That's...  I was just like, oh.  That's strong stuff when you're...  Oh, that's hot.  When you're that age, man.  God, this guy was a creep.  Yep.  What happened to him?  I hope he's dead.  I don't know.  I honestly have very little memory of anything.  Yeah, I bet.  He's gotta be older.  I think he tried to fuck me in the butt once, but it didn't work.  You were his little sex toy.  I think so.  But I think it didn't work. 
[03:05:00]  I have a very vague...  I have a really weird, vague memory of my pants around my ankles, on the steps in this apartment  building, and him trying to do that, but it not happening.  That's all I remember.  It's like peeking your head in a room and a movie's on, and then you walk out.  And you were too scared to run away?  I don't remember.  Fucking guy couldn't even fuck you in the ass, huh?  Yeah, but it wasn't abuse.  Like, let me say, I would play monster with my friends at the same time.  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't like he was forcing me at gunpoint. 
[03:05:30]  Him I remember I was scared of, but I did stuff like that with my other friends that  I wasn't scared of, but him I remember I was frightened of.  Wow.  He tried to...  I believe he did.  ...bang you in the asshole.  I think...  No, it's just a very fleeting and vague memory of that.  Yeah.  Remember when we started the show, we said, something will happen.  We will give you good radio.  Here it is.  Well, that's it.  Yeah, that's all I remember.  I believe you.  I would tell you if I could remember more.  This is coming in a lot, Jimmy.  How many cocks has Jimmy had in his mouth when he was a kid?  And then John W. from Hoboken.  Let's not skip over Jimmy's line. 
[03:06:00]  He was one of the boys I was blowing.  Yeah, I was saying...  And then he writes, I did not move back to the cheese wheel so quickly.  Sorry.  I would say nine or ten when I...  Before...  I told you before I was in fourth grade, I can count nine or ten different people.  Nine or ten different people...  Yeah.  ...would put their penis in your mouth.  Girls too, though.  But girls...  Again, the girls...  There was only two girls.  But girls don't have penises.  No, I liked their little heinies, though.  Oh, yeah.  And I liked...  The little vaginas scared me because I didn't know what they were.  Yeah.  Put their heinies on.  What did you do with their heinies?  I remember this one girl, Janice. 
[03:06:30]  She was like a year older than me, and I was in Devil's Creek, which is what we call the  stupid little woods area, where a lot of our sexual activities would occur.  Devil's Creek.  Yeah.  And I remember I was kneeling behind...  I have a very vague memory of Janice pulling her pants...  I wouldn't show her my penis.  I was too embarrassed.  But I can remember kneeling and putting my face on the cheeks of her ass, and it was so  cool.  That's where my ass fetish came from.  It was the feeling of the coolness of her ass.  Like, I can still have a really weird, vivid memory of the feeling, like just seeing the 
[03:07:00]  ass at my peripheral and putting my face against it and just gently resting.  Did she want you to do anything?  I don't remember.  Like, tongue it?  No, no, no.  It never went there.  I think...  I didn't know what to do with a girl.  Again, a girl scared me a little bit.  I wouldn't even show her my penis.  Sure knew what to do with the boys.  Well, because I had one.  Someone did it to me.  I did it to...  I don't even think I got erections at that age.  I can remember my friend's penis getting erect and me wondering, why did that happen with  his penis?  Like, I didn't know what that was.  Because it was in your mouth?  Well, no. 
[03:07:30]  Now I'm...  Looking back, I pat myself...  I got to kind of give myself a good pat on the back.  I'm like...  Of course you do.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking...  The Hoover Kid.  The Hoover Kid.  Hey, it's Vacuum Jimmy.  Do you think it was so many other guys because the story was going around that, hey, you  could get a blowjob from Jimmy?  No, because we were...  No one talked about it.  We were all kind of...  Like Blowjob Club?  Yeah. 
[03:08:00]  First rule of Blowjob Club, you don't talk about Blowjob Club.  That's right.  Then I realized it was just me hurting my back, rolling down a hill, chasing a cheese wheel,  sucking my own dick.  It was...  And I can remember there was these twins.  I think they were twins.  A brother or sister.  Maybe she was older.  But I would get both of them at different times to sit on my face because they used to  pee their pants.  So I liked that smell.  Yeah.  And that would make them sit on my face behind the bushes so I could smell.  And the girl, I got her to take her pants off.  I know I've told this story before. 
[03:08:30]  I got her to pull her pants off and see her hiney.  And she wouldn't sit in my lap.  I'm like, well, there's some sticker bushes.  You can sit on my lap or you can sit in the sticker bushes.  And she sat in the sticker bushes.  Oh, the sticker bushes.  I will never forget that.  Why your lap?  Why didn't you say your face?  I was, again, I was too young.  Too young.  I was in the...  It was like a little wooded area.  We used to hang out behind...  Was that Devil's Creek?  No.  This was actually...  Devil's Creek.  Yeah, we were fucking dorks.  You've got to get a picture of Devil's Creek.  Oh, yeah.  It scares me.  That's a place that really frightens me.  It should.  I go back to those old apartments sometimes and it's different. 
[03:09:00]  But I took...  In Happy Endings, in the book Happy Endings, I actually photographed the porch that Monster  Rain used to happen under.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But there was no...  I get creeped out by looking at that place, man.  Yeah?  I'd love to walk through my old...  That wooded area.  I'd go with Kenny, though, if he had his fucking weapon with him.  It just freaks me out to walk through there.  Wow.  Is it a scary woods?  I don't remember.  Yeah, what would freak you...  What, like, freaks you out about it?  Don't know.  I just feel like helpless there.  Yeah, some...  I guess so.  Creeped out, yeah.  Yeah.  There's no weapon. 
[03:09:30]  Wouldn't it be funny if you go with Kenny and Kenny makes you blow him?  The only guy you trust.  There he is.  He's got a gun.  He points it to your head and says, suck my dick.  Holy shit.  Completely backfires on you.  I know.  He's trying to get some closure by going back to this place safely.  Kenny rapes you.  That's fucked up.  Oh, and he'll get his dick in your hiney.  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  Wow, that's something. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  That is something.  Wow, the whole area is just, like, taboo.  Something happened, Jimmy.  Something happened.  You're blocking out.  I don't know.  I mean, I know I...  What's he blocking out?  Jesus Christ.  The stuff he remembers is enough.  I can't picture the woods.  I can't picture them.  No, that apartment complex, you said.  Well, they were right next to each other.  There was Marina Gardens was on the bottom, and River Heights, which is...  But you're not at the bottom.  You're not willing to go back into Devil's Creek, and you're a 40-year-old man without  Kenny.  Something happened at Devil's Creek.  Well, only because I don't want to walk through the woods by myself. 
[03:10:30]  I don't know if it went to the...  Most woods are harmless.  We would get from the top of where we lived, like, our apartment's on the top of the hill,  and Marina Gardens are on the bottom.  You know where it is?  It's on Route 1 in New Jersey, where it's where the old flea market used to be, where  you cross over the Raritan River on one side.  I think they're called Riverview Apartments now.  They used to be called River Heights.  And these woods would take you from one down a hill into the other, from what I remember.  Down a little...  Yeah, into the woods. 
[03:11:00]  Just don't remember how it opened up, or...  They're making a new movie, though, with a bunch of kids.  And a bunch of kids, based on this story, it's called Kneel By Me.  I knew you had a good one.  You were very excited.  I thought it was going to be the Blair Bitch or something.  Bitch Project.  Well, I'm sure the listeners have a few.  I'm sure there could be some movies about Devil's Creek.  And, yeah, it's like a Stephen King type of... 
[03:11:30]  Devil's Creek.  That's what they call you, you know.  A Stephen King movie location.  I believe that's what we called it, yeah.  Oh, man.  But it wasn't...  I don't even know if it was a creek.  It might have been.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I just...  Now I remember a piece of plywood.  Look at that.  I think...  Dan is finding your area.  Oh, cool.  Danny's pulling it up on Google Map Images.  He's like, is it around there?  It's a fucking photo from 25,000 fucking feet.  It's from Mars.  It is on Earth, Danny. 
[03:12:00]  Go closer.  I don't know.  It is Earth.  Could you get closer where I can distinguish what's a road and what's fucking mountains?  Is it by a highway?  Yeah.  Is this it right here?  There's like a fucking...  A shrub taken from fucking Jupiter.  I don't know.  I want to find Devil's Creek on the Google...  I can actually see the moon in the foreground.  The fuck do I know if that's it?  Ooh, take it to street level.  All right.  Now we're talking.  That looks a little new.  That looks...  That's very...  No, no.  That doesn't... 
[03:12:30]  Go to River Heights, Riverview Apartments.  I just don't remember.  Anyone that lives in that area, there's a winding road that goes down from one building, one apartment complex.  It goes down...  It winds down in kind of an S into Marina Gardens.  There is a creek.  Or a river.  Well, that's a Ryan River.  That's fucking huge.  Oh, that's a river then.  Okay.  That's not Devil's Creek.  So we're not talking about the river, right?  No, no.  Not the Ryan River, no.  So it must have been something that...  An offshoot off of that, probably.  Offshoot of the river, yes.  If it was a creek, I don't remember it being a creek. 
[03:13:00]  A crick.  I don't want to do anything else.  I just want to find Devil's Creek.  I want to see it now.  Can we take a little, like, what do you call it?  Field trip?  Excursion?  We got to do a field trip to Devil's Creek.  I don't even know if you can walk through it anymore.  I just don't know.  Devil's Creek.  It's not called Devil's Creek.  Officially, we would call it that.  All right.  Well, that looks a little creepy.  Go to Fox...  Go to find us...  I'll tell you my old address.  I used to live at 66 Fox Road in Edison, New Jersey.  That's where I lived when I was a boy.  I don't remember the apartment, but that was the actual address. 
[03:13:30]  All right.  So now...  Pop that up.  Yeah.  Danny's got your old house.  So now walk us...  Yeah, walk us to Devil's Creek.  Come on.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Yeah, that's my old apartment complex, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Oh, look.  There's Jimmy blowing someone.  Yeah.  No, all you see is...  How long ago have these taken?  All you see is a porch, and there's two little feet sticking out from under it with the toes  on the ground, and you can see the little tough skins getting shame dirt on the knees. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, shit.  Wait, you're not a boy in that picture.  Yeah.  Jimmy, what is that?  There's a Saturn park there.  That's a tranny.  Okay, go...  Now, where's Fox Road?  Right there?  Go this way, down this way.  All right.  And wrap around here.  He's turning.  He's making a...  And there's Fox Road.  Wait, hold on.  Let me see which way we would go.  Okay.  Do I have the right perspective?  I think it would be this way.  All right.  He's going back around.  It's a very windy road.  Hold on.  There's the S going down to the apartments down there. 
[03:14:30]  So go back up.  Go back up.  It was, I want to say, this way, in this area here.  I'm circling this area here.  I just can't get the right perspective.  Oh, no.  That looks very wooded.  Yeah, there's no creek in there.  But you see the woods?  It went through there somehow.  It's a lovely dock and deep.  It went through there somehow.  Is that a creek right there?  So maybe there was like a little...  That's off of the river.  Look, that's a creek.  Maybe that's what we named the woods after.  Yeah, yeah.  I just don't remember.  But I'm almost positive that right up here, up to your right, there's like a little... 
[03:15:00]  You can see where Fox Road turns.  And then we used to hang out.  I'm showing him behind these apartments.  This is all a hill going down.  Zoom up a little bit.  Zoom in.  Could you zoom in?  Take a look.  Keep zooming.  Yeah.  It's right up in the top of here is the entrance.  Really?  Oh, look at this.  Yep.  Wow.  Holy shit.  The fucking Google.  Could you go higher, Danny?  To the top of the hill?  Isn't Google, like, really fucked up when you look at what they've done now?  Yeah, it's fucking...  Sir Paul McCartney actually had Google block the view of his house. 
[03:15:30]  Really?  Yeah, if you punch it up, it shows a black screen.  It says, this image has been removed.  Can you do that?  For security reasons.  I guess you can.  Yeah, he's McCartney.  I don't blame him.  It looks a little bit different.  Now, can you show from the other angle?  We're looking back that way.  That's it right there.  That's the entrance right there.  Right there?  Yep, right there.  It used to be bricks.  It says...  They used to be red brick.  It says Valley Manor Apartments, and you'd walk in around the back here and then go into  the woods that way.  Is that where you parked a DeLorean if you went back in time to hide it from people? 
[03:16:00]  Wow.  That's where we would enter.  Wow.  But that was red brick back then, and it didn't say Valley Manor.  It was called Marina Gardens.  Do you remember that speed limit sign?  Was that there?  No, I don't remember any of that.  All I remember is you see to the...  Where are you looking?  I'll show you where we used to walk in.  I'm just looking down here.  So we would enter right there.  So where's Devil's Creek from here?  You would enter right there, and Jimmy's pointing at his mouth.  And we would walk right around that and go into the woods. 
[03:16:30]  Wow.  That's fucked up, huh?  Are you just looking at that shit?  Dude, it's amazing.  Ten years from now, that's going to be all fucking hologram.  You're just going to talk about it, and it's going to appear in front of you.  Yeah, it's going to be right in front of you.  You can walk through it.  The holodeck.  Steven S. from Bayshore, what about Lord of the Open Flies?  That's a good one.  There you go.  Game on.  Yeah.  Oh, we've got to find Devil's Creek.  This little child movie.  Again, I don't remember the creek itself.  It's just the woods.  The woods.  I remember walking back through the woods.  So if you went back there, you would have to go right past that sign and walk through there. 
[03:17:00]  And you wouldn't walk through that by yourself?  Again.  At your age?  I'm 40 now.  I probably have not been back there since I was â€“ it's probably been at least 28 years, maybe 30 years.  There'll be a bunch of guys out there with their dicks hanging out going, we've been waiting for you.  Yeah, where the hell you been?  Where have you been?  Bunch of guys with long Methuselah beards.  It's been a fucking time.  I don't remember, but I don't know what they're like.  You know how sometimes you go back to an area that used to be wooded, and now the apartments are bleeding into it, 
[03:17:30]  and you can kind of go â€“ from one end, you can now see through to the apartments on the other end?  Right, right.  Let's have Kenny gas up the car.  Let's go to Devil's Creek after the show today.  I don't want to do it after the show.  I want to be right to Edison, New Jersey.  I'll sleep.  There'll be nothing there.  We'll all be like, what the fuck is this?  What happened?  We're just in the woods.  Yeah, a bunch of men.  Jimmy, you blow me.  I would hate that, because you guys would tell.  That's suck, I know.  You would tell the next day on the show.  That was the big thing.  Don't tell.  Don't tell.  Don't tell.  You can't tell.  Of course, that's the big thing.  Don't tell. 
[03:18:00]  Rapper T.I.  reports to prison today.  Let's say hi to Lydia.  Lydia.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  Lydia's on the line.  Lydia.  Hi, guys.  I couldn't help but call him.  Jimmy.  Aw.  What?  I think you should definitely take a field trip back to Devil's Creek.  Well, again, I've driven by it many times.  I love the name.  Yeah, it was awful.  Fantastic.  Devil's Creek.  I was thinking we had a cool name for the woods.  I think it was just the woods. 
[03:18:30]  Fuck.  Devil's Creek.  We had the corral.  The corral.  Nice.  What, Lydia?  I think Jimmy definitely has to do a walk-through.  You're grown up now.  It can't hurt you.  No, I would walk through.  I just don't know what kind of kids are back there now.  I don't know if the apartments still have the same clients living in them, the same tenants  living in them, or who knows if it's changed.  Maybe it's government subsidized housing now.  I'm going to get fucking piped over the head.  That could be.  I'm not afraid of a monster.  I think Devil's Creek...  I'm afraid of a monster in a crooked hat.  I think Devil's Creek no longer exists because there's no little boy, you know, crying. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's all dried up now.  I think it's just the tears.  Oh, you like your cleavage picture?  Yeah, we just popped that up so we could get a visual of you.  The only important part.  It makes it so much easier to listen to your dumb voice.  Those mammoth teats.  I got to tell you, that sex thing sells, though.  This dumb picture did very well on Twitter.  I did it?  Yeah.  Did it?  I guess I'll have to become one of your followers, Opie, if I want to see my cleavage. 
[03:19:30]  I don't know.  The comments are brutal on your cleavage.  What they want to do to your cleavage there, Lydia, so...  Maybe I don't want to become a follower, then.  So you're feeling bad for Jimmy and his Devil's Creek thing?  Yeah, I really wasn't going to call today.  I was just going to listen, but then I heard all of Jimmy's, you know, revelations, and...  I've told some of this stuff before.  I just don't remember a lot of it.  Well, you never told the hiney one, where the kid tried to put his penis in your hiney, though.  Yeah, it's a very fleeting memory. 
[03:20:00]  I just didn't...  Yeah, fleeting.  You don't remember, like, a limp noodle brushing up against your butt cheeks?  I don't remember if it was limp or not.  I just don't remember.  You just couldn't get the job done.  Yeah.  Maybe because you resisted.  Maybe you're like, you know what, dude?  You know, the blowing is one thing, but you know what?  I'm not doing this.  But this is how stupid we were.  I would sit, like, you walk into the hallway, and it's like you have his apartment.  And then you walk up a little flight of steps and make a right and go up a couple more steps,  and there was the upstairs apartment.  We would sit three steps up.  We would, like, from his door.  Like, if you open the door to walk into the hallway, you could just see us. 
[03:20:30]  You see him trying to have sex with you.  Yeah, but there was a creaky step that would walk up, like, which you'd hear.  So we always heard when someone was coming because they were metal steps.  Ah, hmm.  And I remember my one friend, I was sucking his penis, and we got caught by another friend.  And then what did the other friend do?  I was so embarrassed, I ran up the steps and made the right and went by the other apartment.  Like, I just ran.  I don't know what to do.  You had to grow up way too fucking soon, man. 
[03:21:00]  How old were you, Jimmy?  And the fact that you're running away shows so much shame.  Of course.  Oh, Jimmy.  You had to grow up way too fast.  Was it like that?  Oh, Danny, you son of a bitch.  Danny just popped up some guy fucking another guy in the ass.  Some guy in a Dracula cape trying to fuck his mouth.  A little fun after the old Halloween party.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, I definitely think you should bring Kenny to the woods with you and master your fear, Jimmy. 
[03:21:30]  I'm not even that afraid of it.  It's just creepy.  Like, you know, I don't have a phobia of it.  It's just creepy.  I don't blame you.  I'd be creeped out too by a place where I was abused and changed.  But you know what I say?  Have fun.  I don't know about abused.  Again, I was never.  I volunteered for a lot of it too.  I can't pass it off as, you know, it felt good and I did it.  It was his fault.  Yes.  You should have seen me in those shorts.  Who could resist?  Jim Sharkey from Fairfield, Connecticut writes,  On Golden Pond seems curiously appropriate. 
[03:22:00]  You were always to blame.  You must have had a lot of blue paint on you, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Let's talk about the day we went to Devil's Creek.  I'd show up at Mr. McGregor's with paint on me.  He'd be like, I know, I see.  It's on you.  Did you have to wash the blue paint off in Devil's Creek?  I don't remember, dude.  So with all those penises, did anyone ever come?  No.  Not to my knowledge at all.  Wow. 
[03:22:30]  They're calling the movie The Bloonies.  All right.  That's funny.  See, you asshole.  That's funny.  If you instant feedback from a cell phone, you've got to put your name somewhere.  You don't get no credit.  Bloonies.  The Bloonies.  All right.  That's a funny movie.  I think we've got a new message board name or a new Twitter name.  Bloonies.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's funny, whoever you are.  Good luck with that, Jimmy.  Thank you, Lydia.  I'm okay. 
[03:23:00]  Tired of those all-inclusive vacation packages to overcrowded Caribbean beaches?  The hottest vacation spot is practically in your own backyard.  Visit Devil's Creek in the heart of downtown Edison, New Jersey.  Here's the founder of the Devil's Creek Tourism Board, James Norton,  who's going to share with you some of his fond memories of this beautiful vacation destination.  I have a really weird, vague memory of my pants around my ankles,  on the steps in this apartment building.  There's an older boy.  An older boy who used to make me suck his penis. 
[03:23:30]  He's got to be older.  I think he tried to fuck me in the butt once, but it didn't work.  First, you'll fly into picturesque Newark, New Jersey.  Then you'll whisk away southbound on the scenic New Jersey turnpike  to beautiful Edison Township,  where you'll be a hop, skip, and a jump away from Devil's Creek,  where your fantasies become a reality.  It was these twins.  I would get both of them at different times to sit on my face  because they used to pee their pants, so I liked that smell.  Yeah.  And that would make them sit on my face behind the bushes so I could smell.  I remember my one friend, I was sucking his penis,  and we got caught by another friend. 
[03:24:00]  He's the same one that fucking creed.  He's the same one that urinated in my mouth.  For memories that'll last a lifetime,  even the suppressed ones,  come visit us at Devil's Creek.  I don't even think I got erection to that age.  I can remember my friend's penis getting erect  and me wondering, why'd that happen with his penis?  I didn't know what that was.  It was in your mouth?  Jesus Christ.  The Hoover Kid.  Devil's Creek.  If you don't leave crying,  we're not trying hard enough.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hi, Sam.  Yeah, hi, you rock.  And that's us.  We're hosting this thing.  Somebody died, Sam. 
[03:24:30]  No!  Yeah.  Nobody you know.  Oh, that's fine, then.  But this gentleman died in a vat of chocolate.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yes, it was.  Well, I bet Opie and Anthony have a very funny,  original, and interesting take on situation.  I bet you Willy Wonka's involved.  I don't understand where you're going with that,  but let's find out on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Obscure movie.  You're listening to the worst.  Oh, wow, that's pretty cool.  No, not at all.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, because it's a piece of shit.  This is very funny.  Investigators say a worker at Cocoa Services 
[03:25:00]  was loading chunks of raw chocolate into a melting tank  when he slipped and fell.  Several employees tried to help out,  but couldn't reach him.  There are paddles called agitators  that are moving inside this vat.  He was hit by one of them  before someone could hit the shutoff valve.  An EMT consoled another worker  after he jumped in and tried to pull the man out.  But the vat was eight feet deep  and full of melted chocolate,  heated to 120 degrees.  And this man, unfortunately, fell into this hole, 
[03:25:30]  and he passed away before anyone could do anything about it.  What a way to go.  I know, full stomach.  Delicious.  What happened with the, what are those paddles called?  Agitators.  How do they work?  I don't think it's good.  They probably go like,  wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  You know, like a blender kind of a thing.  Like, you ever see a dough mixer  at a restaurant or something?  Oh, I see him in a banker.  I don't think it's good.  I don't think it's good.  I don't think it's good.  No.  Please.  Some guy that goes and hangs in parties with female deer. 
[03:26:00]  Which other dough mix for this evening.  I got it.  That's horrible.  It's a guy that has too many Ray Mee's  and Fosso Lattes in a row.  Come on, idiot.  Mix it up a little.  Yeah, an agitator's not good.  It's agitating everything.  Yeah, agitators aren't good.  You're not going to survive the agitator.  Oh, shit. 
[03:26:30]  That's an agitator?  There's a lot of different agitation devices.  Well, the thing in your washing machine  is called an agitator.  Okay.  E-Rock is an agitator.  He sure is.  He would have eaten his way out of there, though.  Yeah, he would have.  He's just a fucking chubby kid with a fucking...  Oh, look at that one.  Wow, that's an agitator.  Do you think the guy started heartening  like an Easter bunny?  A chocolate Easter bunny?  A chocolate casing?  Yeah, like a chocolate...  Or they just leave him there?  Who the fuck's going to hose him off? 
[03:27:00]  Clean him up?  As he's dead with chocolate all over him.  Remember what killed him?  Just leave him in chocolate in the coffin.  It'd look great.  Remember Larry?  He was delicious.  Yeah, he'd just chip off his nose and eat it.  Give me one of Larry's tootsies.  I'm hungry.  Look, if any of my family members die in this way,  open casket and we don't wash the chocolate off.  Let's at least have a laugh.  Oh, God damn.  That's right.  That's frightening, Danny.  This guy was a real...  Oh, my God.  This guy was a fondouche. 
[03:27:30]  Fondouche.  What is that a commercial for?  It's an old Axe body spray commercial.  It's been getting a lot of air played recently.  The guy's made of chocolate, yeah, chocolate man.  Chocolate type of guy.  Walking around.  He's kind of scary.  Yeah.  Look, his arm is missing.  Yeah.  People are eating him.  Suck his cock.  She just ate his ass.  She just ate his ass.  Fid his ass.  Ate his ass.  She's got brown all around her mouth.  That was kind of cool. 
[03:28:00]  Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Mike?  Yeah, I guess you could say it was death by chocolate.  You ever have that?  It's wonderful.  Punching out, boys.  He actually died.  Mongo the trucker.  Mongo.  Did the corner lick him clean like the old paint bed or the old batter mixture?  Oh, boy.  I didn't even hear you yet, boy.  You were there, though.  What did you say, dude?  Uh, no, Jimmy.  I ain't getting it. 
[03:28:30]  You know, Mongo knows that gag.  Yeah, I guess so.  More to the story.  A few hours later, distraught family members arrived at the gate wanting to know what happened.  Um, fell in and died, idiots.  He was never negative.  He's always smiling.  He was the sweetest man we knew.  Guess what positive people die, you know?  What is the sweetest man we knew?  This is just not like him to die in a vat of chocolate.  I don't know what he was thinking.  Yeah, he loved his wife and his kids. 
[03:29:00]  We didn't realize he had problems.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  He's the sweetest man we knew.  Aw.  He was never negative.  He was always smiling and laughing.  The victim was 29-year-old Vincent.  I didn't know he was a snicker.  Oh, here we go.  Pen's out.  What?  All right.  Here come the candy bar jokes.  Candy bar jokes will be accepted on the phone lines.  All right.  And go. 
[03:29:30]  Let me say hi to Joe.  I log on.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Listen, did the Oopaloopas come out and start singing to this guy?  Sing a song about him.  Then he's just gone.  We've got an agitator for you.  Once again, very low.  So why are you even playing it?  If you are wise, you'll listen to me.  What do you get when you go down streets? 
[03:30:00]  Eating as much as an elephant.  What are you at?  Getting terribly fat.  What do you think will come of that?  I don't like the look of it.  All right, let's turn it down.  This is fucking rules.  Yeah, yeah.  Really fits.  You will drink cum oompa, loompa.  Steve Jones.  Someone is saying that the Smothers Brothers had a song called I Fell in a Vat of Chocolate.  Really? 
[03:30:30]  Now that would be a fine.  Let's get to the second half of the story out of the way here.  A few hours later, distraught family members arrived at the gate wanting to know what happened.  He was a good kid.  He was never negative.  He was always smiling and laughing.  The victim was 29-year-old Vincent Smith, Jr. of Candace.  I bet there was one part where he wasn't smiling and laughing.  He was a temporary who'd only been on the job a couple weeks.  His brother says he'd been looking for work for a long time.  He just prayed really hard to get a job, and God finally answered his prayers.  And as Maid said, he was always so positive.  God, what? 
[03:31:00]  I guess God needed a possibility.  Just for it to happen like this and not to know exactly what happened.  Having nobody wanted to come speak to us, it's just hard.  It seems like they're trying to cover something up or hide something.  He shouldn't have fell.  He should have held on, but he was such a butterfinger.  Oh, bull.  Yeah.  I fell in a vat of chocolate.  Oh.  I fell in a vat of chocolate.  What'd you do when you fell into the chocolate? 
[03:31:30]  I died.  Oh.  Yes.  My spleen was knocked out through my asshole, and then I vomited into the chocolate and was  scarred and died.  It's good until the agitator spun.  Yes.  It sounds fun, but you don't think of swallowing delicious snack food.  You think of being suffocated in scalding liquid.  You know, just for it to happen like this, you know, and not to know exactly what happened 
[03:32:00]  and, you know, having nobody wanted to come speak to us, it's just hard.  You know, it seems like they're trying to cover something up or hide something, you know.  You shouldn't say cover up.  Cover up.  Yeah.  And lovely milk chocolate.  Right.  Look, the guy slipped into the stupid vat of chocolate.  It's very unfortunate.  It happens.  Nobody wanted the guy to go in the chocolate.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  They have to clean the whole vat out.  Right.  It's a pain in the ass for everybody.  And you know they're going to reuse that vat.  So someone's going to be eating chocolate that was made from dead guy vat.  Oh.  It's great.  His fucking shoes.  Probably shit on them.  Denver Pest says he heard the guy was having mounds of fun. 
[03:32:30]  He slipped into that whatchamacallit.  Told you.  Here come the joke.  You know what?  Fucking the family's already filed a lawsuit.  They want a hundred grand.  I think they might just get a payday.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  You know what the problem was?  He had his iPod on.  He was listening to M&M's.  Jesus. 
[03:33:00]  Ah, well.  That's terrible.  What a horrible story.  Yeah.  Quick.  Candy.  Candy.  They should play the Candyman can at his week.  Oh, God.  They never want to hear that song again.  Nope.  Let's go to Rook and make the song run.  Oh, wish Fred Travolino when you need him.  Sprinkle it with dew.  Yeah.  Fill his pants with dew.  As the agitator cracked his spine in two.  And turns his body into goo. 
[03:33:30]  That clumsy asshole can.  The clumsy asshole can.  And he slips into the vat because he's a clumsy asshole.  And he has slippy shoes.  Slippy shoes.  Who stands on the vat rim.  Falls in on his head.  The agitators spin.  And now he's pretty dead.  The clumsy asshole can. 
[03:34:00]  The clumsy asshole can.  I only have one eye and even I never did that.  The clumsy asshole did.  Rick in New York.  Rick.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, Rick.  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  Okay.  Yeah.  The only thing about that is if you buried him with a chocolate on him,  Reverend Al would show up in protest about trying to bury a snigger. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, God.  Boo!  Why?  Why?  Why, sir?  It's not even.  I don't.  I don't even.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Did Mr. Goodbar get a lot of snickers from the coroner?  Talk about trying to.  Oh, he leaves behind a little daughter.  Oh, does he?  Yeah.  At least he didn't take her with him. 
[03:35:00]  Well.  Leaves her behind.  Good thing.  Scott C. from Cleveland.  He leaves behind a little daughter.  Little Baby Ruth.  Oh, oh, okay.  I didn't even see that one coming.  He's just crying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have liked his.  I wouldn't have liked the taste of him anyway.  He comes with nuts.  Ouch.  Let me say hi to Bill and Buffalo.  Bill and Buffalo.  I hate nuts.  You don't like them? 
[03:35:30]  I hate nuts and chocolate.  Oh, I don't like them in chocolate either.  I like them when they're in a big, greasy ball sack.  It's the only way to take your nuts.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  Fucking sweaty and nervous.  Sweaty and nervous.  With fucking big mat of hair on them.  Nice short taint ride to the asshole.  Big pair of greasy workman's balls.  Big low hangers.  They fucking pop out of the side of his boxer briefs all the time.  Get sweat on them.  Hello, Bill. 
[03:36:00]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, Bill, man.  Say any obvious?  Chocolate rain.  Yes.  Agitate her against my brain.  Chocolate rain.  Pull my legs out separately from my head.  Again.  Chocolate rain.  120-degree chocolate causes pain.  Chocolate rain. 
[03:36:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Morning.  Good morning.  Is this guy now a special darkie?  I don't get that either.  Footer.  Hey.  Footer.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, unfortunately, I heard this guy roll-o'd into the vat of chocolate.  All right.  We're back on track.  Terry the Trucker.  Terry.  Pokey and corny. 
[03:37:00]  Hey.  Morning, boys.  Did you have an accident happen down there on Fifth Avenue?  It happened on Fifth Avenue.  Wow.  Fifth Avenue.  That's not a coincidence.  What an awful candy bar.  The Fifth Avenue.  I don't remember what that was.  That's just horrible.  I thought it was just like a little wrapper with rich white lady feet in it.  Little toes.  Yeah.  Little white lady toes.  Yeah.  Chocolate covered.  Sean in Albany.  Hey.  Hey.  I hear his family just wanted to give him one last kiss.  Oh.  Ah, see?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey.  Joe. 
[03:37:30]  Hey.  How you doing?  Did the foreman come out and tell the family, listen, I'm not going to sugarcoat it?  John in North Carolina.  The worst part was at the funeral when they rolled the casket into the back of the Hershey.  His wife just failed to reach a piece of his man.  It was awful.  Wow.  Your other line would have been way better.  Yeah.  It says on the screen.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Go with the other line.  He was a great guy.  He was always laughing, cutting up, playing twigs on people. 
[03:38:00]  He was a great guy.  Playing twigs on people.  I get it.  That's cool.  As you said that, a gunshot should have just ran out at the end of the phone call.  Let's see what Florida has.  Robert in Florida.  Robert.  If the chocolate on the skin or it gets the hose, it goes, ah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Damn.  Punch it out.  Did they say if he was skinny or a little chunky?  Let's go to the guy.  Alex?  Yeah.  I think his co-workers asked him, what would he do for a Klondike bar? 
[03:38:30]  Ooh.  Anthony in Boston.  Anthony.  Almost done with this.  Anthony.  Morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  I was wondering if people used to call him a nougat when he was young.  All right.  Chris in PA.  Hold on a second.  That joke was so awful, I want to swing a medieval mace in his face.  Like one of those fucking spiked balls on a chain.  I want to wind up and just smash.  And he's with it.  That's really not liking someone. 
[03:39:00]  He'd hear the whoosh of the metal ball.  And he'd feel like he has his cheekbone.  The whoosh.  I'm sorry, man.  Go ahead.  Chris in PA.  I bet you can hear his bones crackle throughout the plant.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Crackle.  Ooh.  See ya.  Captain Eddie from New Hampshire.  The last thing his co-workers heard was a Nestle's Crunch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I didn't know this.  Stryker.  What do you got, Stryker?  Hey, buddy. 
[03:39:30]  I heard his wife's name was Peppermint Patty.  What a coincidence.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  Crazy shit.  It's amazing how fast I can hate this bitch.  Yeah, I know.  I hate it.  How much do you hate it?  Ah, it's fucking horrendous.  Let's go to Steve in Nevada.  Steve.  Hey, what's up, bu-bu-bu-boy?  Hi.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, I just wanted to say I had an uncle that used to work at the Guinness factory, and  he drowned in one of the vats.  Took him three hours to drown, but he had to get out three times to take a piss.  Ba-dum-ba-ba-dum-ba. 
[03:40:00]  Nothing?  Yeah.  You're getting it right now.  Exactly.  A tumbleweed actually blew across the fucking speakers.  I think we say end-  Holy shit.  End-  Scene.  Was he going to the Kit Kat club?  Yeah, where were you headed?  Kit Kat club?  Yeah.  Show me how you get crushed by an agitator. 
[03:40:30]  Boy, that must have sucked when he fell in, and that thing just bashed him, bashed his  head apart.  Wow.  Oh, I was injured in a chocolate machine.  It was agitating me.  Yeah, that's got it.  You think he slipped because he had Butterfingers?  Did we-  Listen to the replay.  Oh, I got that one?  All right.  You'll love it the first time.  All right.  All right.  I wasn't sure if we got the Butterfingers one in there.  Yeah.  Everyone's just repeating them now.  All right.  This is nowhere to go with this, except fucking home.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:41:00]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, Iraq, Sam.  I'm somewhat in that order.  Intern David is somehow involved next.  Well, Intern David should always be involved, but this is the birth of Executive Intern David.  You'll get to hear it all next on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is Historic.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm Iraq, and that's primetime Sam Roberts.  And this bit involves one of Sam's favorite people, Intern David.  What bit is it?  This one is where you presented David with the honorary title of Executive Intern. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, my goodness.  This is the creation of the Executive Intern title, a title that has lived on beyond Intern  David.  I decided David was somebody who took positions of authority to his head.  Like, everything just went straight to his head.  He was born to be a boss that does nothing.  He's confronted your girlfriend, my girlfriend, Opie's wife. 
[03:42:00]  What are you doing here?  Why are you here?  Who are you?  Yes.  And so I decided that he needed to be a leader of the interns, and with that, a matching title  must come.  Thus, Executive Intern David.  And this is the bit.  On the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You ever listen to me?  To the worst.  The worst.  No, I don't want to be involved in this.  The worst.  Yeah.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, I see Intern David is here today.  Yeah.  David, is it true you're the Executive Intern? 
[03:42:30]  You're in charge of everybody.  David, why don't you come over?  Yeah, come on over here, because we're going to start.  Where's Kenny?  Kenny usually makes the hats for ERA.  So I hear you're Office Manager, and also you're the Executive Intern.  Executive Intern and Office Manager over at the XM side.  And what do those jobs entail?  Executive Intern entails me giving out orders to the other interns and telling them what to do.  Orders.  They must love that, huh?  Like when someone has to get the breakfast or get the coffees, I decide who gets to go do the breakfast, who gets to get the coffees, get the newspapers in the morning. 
[03:43:00]  You delegate that responsibility.  Yes, I certainly do.  You're like a trustee.  I certainly do delegate that.  Are you taking the job very seriously?  Yes, I am.  Yeah?  Yes, sir.  Sam, is he taking the job very seriously?  Extremely seriously.  He's ready to be a leader.  Is he?  And can I ask David, why when you're talking to the mic, are you bent like you're being filmed in a hurricane?  Why don't you just raise the mic up a little bit?  Raise the mic up and stand up straight.  Yeah, you wouldn't seem more comfortable.  That's how the mic is.  I'm just touched. 
[03:43:30]  Go over.  Yes, sir.  How would you be comfortable?  I hear also that he does the mic checks every morning.  Do we have that audio there?  What do you do for mic checks there, David?  Well, Tim comes in and he has to check all the microphones.  So he tells me to check each one.  So I go around to all the mics and make sure that they're working.  And Tim checks.  And I just say, like, oh, this is the mic and talk into it.  Like when he says, oh, okay, go test Anthony's mic.  I say, oh, this is Anthony's mic.  Hello, hello, Anthony's mic.  And he checks to see if it works.  And I do that with Jimmy's mic, the guest mic, and the mic's on the couch. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah?  And I hope he just shrugs because I know he's wondering the same thing I am.  That's why there's no tape.  Oh, here it is.  Thank you.  When David's using the mic for production or doing this, you can tell he went to school for this  because he puts a fist to his mouth and then to the mic to make sure there's the exact proper distance.  So the sound, just like that.  Is that how far you're supposed to be?  That's what I was taught at the good old Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  They told me to put a fist there so that you can have a proper distance.  No, when they say put a fist there, that's not what they meant to me. 
[03:44:30]  Bradley, the kid enjoys German pornography as much as I do.  He's a good boy.  He got it.  He got it.  There you go.  He's cracking up now.  He's cracking up.  He's cracking up.  Yeah, but that's what they taught me there, to have a proper distance between your mouth and the mic.  Let me try that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Let me try that.  I'm going to put a fist between my mouth and the mic.  Wow, we've been doing this wrong for years.  And now talk.  Wow.  Wow, it's perfect.  Yeah, I don't like it.  You know what?  The needles aren't pinning.  You've got to go like this.  God, I think the kid just taught me something. 
[03:45:00]  You've got to get right on the mic.  I'm farther away.  Yeah, I like doing this.  It gives me a little bass in my voice.  With talk radio, there is a dynamic, depending on what you're doing, if you're yelling or if you're talking a little softer.  Yeah, you've got to move around.  You do have to kind of move around.  I'm just putting my fist on.  I'm going with the professionals over at the school that I did.  Hey, what's up?  What am I?  All right, you know what?  Ass, let me tell you something about the Connecticut School of Broadcasting, you cocksucker.  Let me tell you something. 
[03:45:30]  I think I'm considered a professional in the business.  Let me tell you the difference.  We're doing it.  Those guys couldn't make it in the business, so they're teaching zeros like people how to get in the business.  A fist.  What?  Kenny, everyone heard you trying to whisper him a lot.  You whispered into a mic, Kenny.  Way to go, Kenny.  No.  If they were so good, wouldn't they be doing radio?  I guess they taught me wrong.  Thank you.  I love how he said, well, they're professionals. 
[03:46:00]  We're telling them different.  They're not professionals.  And we're not professionals?  We are, but...  Look, the Connecticut School of Broadcasting might...  Conflicting, conflicting stuff.  We get paid to do the job, not teach the job.  I know.  And they get paid to teach it, which makes them professional teachers.  Right.  But they're not like professional broadcasters.  It might be a great company.  I have no idea when it comes right down to it, but I would say that most of those guys  want to be doing a radio show, not teaching radio, like you, anyway. 
[03:46:30]  Tell them about the famous alumni out of...  Oh, yeah, David.  That's what Kenny was whispering to you that everyone in two countries heard.  Famous alumni?  Yeah.  Did they tell you about the famous alumni that came out of there?  Oh, they told me.  And who are they?  Well, Jimmy's good friend, Artie Lang, is at Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  Is Artie at Connecticut School of Broadcasting?  Yeah, it's the same...  Yes, New Jersey, yeah.  He is.  It's pretty funny.  Because of that, Jimmy's canceling his gig with him.  I'm going to set fire to Artie's dressing room door when I see him.  Oh, because of that? 
[03:47:00]  That's so rude of you.  That was kind of the joke.  No, I wouldn't burn the man to death because he attended that school.  No, I'm kidding, David.  Yes.  It was a little joke.  Yes.  All right, so Artie, who else?  A sportscaster you might have heard of named Joe Beningo.  Beningo is my favorite guy at the fan.  I love Joe Beningo.  240 on the fan, and he wants to cut his own throat when the Jets lose.  He's an animal.  All right, well, that's famous.  Yes, sir.  The list really falls off after Beningo, doesn't it? 
[03:47:30]  Beningo and Artie.  And there's also, I don't know if you guys know who Kevin Burkhardt is.  No one does.  He's the guy that, he's on SNY now, the Mets station.  He reports on the field.  Oh, okay, okay.  On the field in SNY.  I don't know him.  No, we have no idea.  No one's ever heard of him.  Mr. and Mrs. Burkhardt know him.  He's a sideline reporter.  Like, he goes on the field during the Mets games and reports from the stands and stuff,  and he doesn't refuse to all the players.  Exactly.  All right, who else?  Pam Oliver?  Who else?  Pam Oliver?  I don't think so.  No, I know.  Not the NFL on Fox woman, no.  Right, no.  So who else besides, Artie is by far the biggest name. 
[03:48:00]  Artie and Bedingo is doing well.  And there's also Roger All.  Do you know Roger All?  Roger All?  Yeah, the director of sports on Fox 5.  Yes, he's doing a show with Ted Partial.  That's his name.  He's a teacher at Connecticut School of Broadcasting, and everyone says he's like a real famous person.  I've never heard of him.  If someone has to say he's famous and you don't know it, he's not famous.  He's not famous.  According to the instructors there, he's like a legend.  No, he's not.  He has a great cleaning product. 
[03:48:30]  Boy, you really are sticking with that fist length away from the mic thing.  Yes, I certainly am.  He knows.  Well, you want to hear him doing mic checks?  Oh, yes.  You recorded that?  Yeah, this is what he does every morning for everybody.  You recorded it?  What do you think?  Hello, it's Anthony Cumia.  Hello, hello.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Okay, so you're checking my mic.  Correct.  And you have to say, hello, this is Anthony Cumia.  I don't have to say that. 
[03:49:00]  I can say whatever I want to on the mic.  Oh, hey, hello.  What am I to say?  I choose to pretend that I'm the person who uses that mic when I'm checking the mic.  I know.  It was uncanny.  It's very smart.  Yes, it is.  Because then the person knows whose mic you're checking.  Well, Mike, you're checking.  Correct.  I like it.  All right.  Hello, it's Anthony Cumia.  Hello, hello.  Hello, hello.  I'm a co-host.  I'm a co-host.  Anthony Jumia.  Hello, I'm a co-host. 
[03:49:30]  I'm a co-host.  Who's the co-host?  Mike.  The one I'm sitting on right now, sitting on right now, is the co-host.  Okay.  Hello, hello.  I'm a co-host.  I'm a co-host.  Co-host.  That's a guest mic.  Bob Kelly?  Bob Kelly's a co-host sometimes.  Patrice O'Neill, he's a co-host.  It's a guest mic, dummy.  The color of this microphone's cable's yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow.  Now green.  This cable's green, green.  Hello, green, green, green. 
[03:50:00]  Hello, I'm Jimmy Norton.  Hello, hello.  He did a little voice.  Hello.  I feel accurate.  I like it.  It sounds good.  All right, guys.  It's Opie today.  Opie.  Opie Hughes.  Never calls himself that, by the way.  That's all right.  Whatever.  I forgot the quote.  I hear you doing staff impressions.  Oh.  Oh.  You sort of heard, I sort of heard a little Jimmy there, so.  Yeah, I tried to do a Jimmy, a Jimmy Norton voice there.  I mean, I'm not that easy to do, but I mean, it's like, hello, I'm Jimmy Norton.  Hello.  Hello, Jimmy Norton. 
[03:50:30]  Hello.  Oh, hello.  Who else do you do?  Kenny.  Oh, you do Kenny?  Uh, yes, I did an impression of Kenny.  All right, let's hear it.  You guys got to look at me, like, because it's more of an impression, basically, like,  looking.  Sure, of course.  All right.  Do Kenny.  I'll do an impression of Kenny.  That's my impression of Kenny, because he's always sleeping in his chair.  We got it.  He's always sleeping in his chair.  Sure, that's good.  Oh, that's good. 
[03:51:00]  It's not like the bosses are listening or anything.  That's the best.  Way to blow up his spot.  That's the best thing to do, take an impression of somebody from when they're, like, sleeping  and not really doing anything.  Yeah.  That's the same impression, by the way, of everyone else who's sleeping in the world.  Yeah.  Here's my impression of every human who sleeps.  Sorry, David.  It's all right.  I know it's everyone sleeping, but.  What do you do, Steve, too?  Yeah, see if I just, like, run really fast out the door, because he's always, like, rushing  out the door to do something, to, like, go in here and tell someone an important message. 
[03:51:30]  Can we put a door that goes out to the side of the building?  Hold on.  That should be, that impression of Kenny should be your impression of Steve working.  Wow, you are killing David today.  It's really funny.  Why is that funny, though?  It just is.  I don't know.  I mean, Jimmy's a very funny man, but why is that joke in particular funny?  Of course it is.  It just is.  Are you saying because it's accurate?  I guess so.  I don't want to say anything on the air, but I guess I just did.  No, you're allowed to.  You can say whatever you want.  Do you think Steve's a good worker? 
[03:52:00]  He's a good worker.  What did you say right before we went on the air?  I don't want to say anything about him on the air.  No, on the air, you're allowed to say anything.  You're safe.  They should have taught you that at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  You know, the professionals.  Yeah.  On the air, you're safe, because what you say, it can be interpreted as entertainment.  Entertainment value, no matter how realistic it is.  Uh-huh.  But you're safe, so you could say it.  What did you say before?  About what?  About Steve.  I just was telling my impression of how I'm... 
[03:52:30]  Do you think he's good?  He's all right.  Do you think he's good?  No.  He's all right, though.  No.  Wow.  He wouldn't do too well in the interrogation room, David.  Wow.  You know, at least you know he's not an Al-Qaeda mastermind.  He's all right.  Do you really think he's all right?  Yeah, he's just all right, yeah.  Do you think he's all right?  Yeah.  David.  Yes.  You're on the air.  You're safe here.  This is a safe place.  Yeah.  Very safe place. 
[03:53:00]  Now, answer Sam's question.  Do you think Steve's good?  Sometimes.  He could be good sometimes.  Like when?  I don't know.  Percentage of good to bad.  Yeah.  What would you say?  How much percent good?  Remember, you're in a safe place.  You're in front of us.  We make all final decisions, my friend.  You say sometimes he's good.  Is it sometimes, you know, what percent of the time?  There he is.  What percent of the time?  Don't let him intimidate you.  He's right there in the phone booth.  Don't intimidate the witness.  I can't do it.  Opie and Anthony are on your side.  That's right. 
[03:53:30]  What percent?  It's the Opie and Anthony show, not the Steve show.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  It's not right.  We are asking you, what percentage of the time is he good?  What percentage, for real?  I can't do it.  He's right there.  Say a number.  Come on.  What percentage?  Now he's behind me.  What percentage?  Now he's putting his face to my...  Now he's blowing in my...  Dave, is it closer to zero or ten?  No, that's more than ten.  David.  More than ten? 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  What's it less than?  Steve's right on top of David.  I know.  Is it less than 20?  Yeah, he's less than 20.  I would say he's going to beat me up or something.  No, he's not.  I don't know.  I'd say probably...  It's not as bad as people are making it out to be.  It's probably like 50.  Well, now what...  What did Sam ask you?  Sam said, is Steve good? 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  What was your answer?  Is he good?  He's all right.  How good is he?  He's all right.  No, what did you say?  David.  He's all right.  What did you say?  What did you say?  He's all right.  That's not what he said.  I didn't mean what I said, though.  What did you say, though?  I said no, but I didn't mean that.  Why didn't you mean it?  I don't know.  I'm just joking around.  I didn't mean that.  All right.  Like a presence at...  Whatever you just said.  What percentage?  50.  No.  Yes, yes.  David.  Yes. 
[03:55:00]  Steve's intimidating the hell out of him.  He's in here.  And even with that, David can only admit that it's 50.  Yeah, I know, right?  I just want to acknowledge that.  Even with intimidation, that's not a failing grade.  Right.  Steve wasn't around.  I think that number would be lower in David's eyes.  All right.  We've got to start the fluffernutter hat on E-Rock  as we go to break here.  David, congratulations, by the way, on your new duties.  You're doing them very well.  Oh, I thank you.  If I may say one thing, Steve wanted me to say what I said about Travis. 
[03:55:30]  He wants you guys to know what I was saying about Travis.  What did you say about Travis?  Oh.  Because we're on the topic of how do I rate the staff members here.  So Travis, I would say, didn't do any work.  Oh.  But Travis isn't even here to defend himself today.  Oh, she's slacking off.  Yeah.  Take it on vacation day.  I guess apparently, David, you're not privy to the emails on a nightly basis that we all 
[03:56:00]  get to share in.  No, I'm not privy to those.  Where Travis pretty much gives a rundown of all the big stories of the world.  He doesn't email the interns, no.  Ooh.  So what you're saying is you're speaking out of complete ignorance.  I'm just speaking out of what I see.  I don't see these emails, so I don't know about them.  So you don't see what he's doing on his off time.  No, I do not.  As he goes on his computer and other things and finds things. 
[03:56:30]  Danny, he's got some names.  I don't see it that much.  Aside from not being on the emails, you're also not in the office before the show, nor  in Travis's phone booth during the show.  No, I'm not.  Nor in Travis's area at the XM Sirius side of the show.  So how would you even really know what anybody does around here?  Let me tell you something.  Because you don't work too closely to any of us.  That's true.  I'll tell you something, David.  No matter what time I get in here, sometimes I'm in here early.  Obviously, Travis is always at his desk when I walk in.  It doesn't matter what time it is. 
[03:57:00]  And he is working diligently.  Nick Carter usually at his desk when you walk in.  Nick Carter.  Nick Carter.  He loves that, Jimmy.  He loves that one.  That's why I like that guy.  He's a good guy.  To base your...  What do you base your opinion on?  I'm just basing my opinion on one day, probably just one day in the very beginning of my internship  when I saw Travis just staring at his face in the phone.  I'll tell you what he's basing it on.  He's basing it on heat. 
[03:57:30]  I guess to David, the amount of work that you do depends on how much you're liked by that person.  So if Travis really doesn't like you, then I guess he really doesn't do any work.  I'm kind of half and half with you, so I guess I must work just half good.  What do you think about Danny?  Do you think he works a lot?  Yes, I certainly do.  Danny's always working hard.  Really?  Danny, Travis doesn't like him?  At this point in time, I don't think much of anybody really enjoys David too much.  I love the kid.  Sam's got his hand raised, too.  Well, because you guys just have your little on-air time, and then it's back home. 
[03:58:00]  But we actually have to deal with him.  But he's the executive intern, Danny.  He is the executive intern.  You don't just get that position.  He earned it.  I've got to know my role.  I'm sorry.  Are you putting that on your resume when you go to look for a job that you are the executive intern?  I'm going to switch my resume to executive, yes.  Executive intern.  I had just intern.  Now I'm going to switch to executive intern slash office manager.  Okay, executive intern.  And then you have to put duties that you did as an executive intern.  What do you list? 
[03:58:30]  I'm going to list telling the other interns what to do.  Giving out the order.  Giving the orders to other interns.  Other interns.  Like this old man that is in time.  Yes, correct.  A 38-year-old, yes.  A 38-year-old.  With two kids.  With two kids.  Jesus.  Do you listen to the executive intern?  Yes, I have to listen to the executive intern.  Yeah.  Sam is forcing all interns to listen to the executive intern.  Oh, Sam is instigating. 
[03:59:00]  You know he's involved with this.  Sam is the one that appointed me executive intern.  Of course he did.  He appointed you?  He appointed me, yes.  Oh, appointed.  Okay.  Yeah.  So he appointed you.  Boy, I didn't know you had that in your job description, Sam.  Well, he's just a dick.  I love it.  Of course he is.  What I really like, David and me, Sirius came and told all the interns that they all  had to have a mentor and that it should probably just be Steve.  So everybody just put Steve as their mentor, so he just signs the paperwork, except David, 
[03:59:30]  because David said Steve wouldn't do a good job as his mentor.  What a set of balls on this kid.  And then asked if I would be his mentor instead.  Wow, he actually asked you.  That's nice.  Yes, they said.  He went from a bear to a viper.  Yes, we had a meeting with HR people from Sirius.  Yeah.  And you told them you didn't think.  They said Steve will be everyone's mentor, and I said, I don't want Steve to be my mentor.  You told HR that?  Yes, I did.  You pretty much ratted out Steve.  Yes, I did. 
[04:00:00]  No, I didn't rat him out.  No, I didn't rat him out.  I just said, I don't want Steve to be my mentor.  Do you understand that that negatively impacts Steve to the superiors?  I asked them, can I have Sam as my mentor?  And they said, who's Sam?  And I explained to them, and I showed them.  And they said, oh, okay, Sam, you can be okay.  Not good.  Sam is my mentor, yes.  Paul has something.  Look at this.  Oh, God, I'm sorry.  Paul, you have something?  I just wanted to point out that some of David's executive duties does include removing staples  from pieces of paper and then re-stapling them after they've been filed and scanned. 
[04:00:30]  Got to be done.  And that you have to tell him that every day.  I had to take the tape staples out and re-staple again.  Why are you re-stapling stuff there, executive intern?  Those are the rules for all the darn paperwork that we've got to clean up.  All the darn paperwork.  Radio friendly.  We've got to clean up the mess of one specific individual who messed up all the paperwork and  threw it all over their office.  We've got to fix it all up, and it's all unorganized.  Who did that?  A certain individual that's no longer with us.  Oh, oh, okay. 
[04:01:00]  Yes, a certain individual that's no longer with us threw all the paperwork all over the office  and messed it up, and we have to reorganize it and scan it.  Why did he throw it all over?  So he didn't do a good job.  He wasn't doing his job.  Oh, my God.  So now we've got to fix it all up.  So that's why I'm unstapling so that they can scan it.  Unstapling, scanning, and then stapling again.  Stapling again, and then filing them, storing them by year and by alphabetical order.  He doesn't scan.  He just pulls the staples out and then puts new staples in.  Oh, okay.  You're not in charge of the scanning part. 
[04:01:30]  No, I'm not in charge of the scanning.  Why aren't you doing that part?  Is that a responsibility to someone else?  Yes.  More like he's not willing to learn how to do the scanning.  Do you know how to scan?  Yes, I know how to scan.  So why don't you scan?  I don't know.  I just kind of decided on my own.  Okay, I'm going to staple.  I'm going to unstaple.  I'm going to do the alphabetizing.  Now, about the time you get in, I've heard about this too.  Now, what time do the interns report you?  We are required to meet Sam at XM at 4.30 a.m. 
[04:02:00]  Sam, 4.30 a.m.  David, what time do you come in?  I come in at 4.40.  No, you don't come in at 4.40.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Your mentor is saying you don't come in at 4.40.  That's not true.  I come in at 4.40.  You come in at 5 o'clock.  Mentor?  I do not come in at 5.  Everyone is saying you come in at 5.  Generally, he arrives around 4.45, which he says.  I don't think it's necessarily true most of the time.  But today, he got here at 4.45 because we were walking from XM to CBS.  Even though he saw us, he went to XM anyway.  And when questioned, he explained he had to go up to XM, even though we were already 
[04:02:30]  there to make sure the other interns didn't forget anything.  Oh, Jesus.  Takes his duty seriously.  So why do you come in later than the other interns?  It's...  I got no explanation for that.  But you're the executive intern.  That's one of the perks.  You're not trying to make up your own hours?  No, I'm not trying to...  No.  I think, David, that's one of the perks of being the executive intern.  Uh-huh.  Mm.  I...  I don't know what he just said. 
[04:03:00]  I don't know what he's whispering to you while I'm talking to you.  He's the executive intern.  I think that's one of the perks of being the executive intern.  So that's a perk you're able to just come in later.  I guess it is.  Are you going to be supervising the fluffernutter hat that we're putting on EROC to make sure  it's done right?  Only if interns are...  Only if interns are doing it.  So if interns are involved, you supervise.  Yes, I don't supervise any of the staff members.  Only interns.  Only interns.  Paul, yes.  One of our interns.  I would just say that David's supervision usually involves asking one of us what he should  be doing. 
[04:03:30]  But you're the executive intern.  You're the executive intern.  Why are you asking them?  Yeah, why?  But then he doesn't do it anyway.  So he'll ask us what to do, we'll tell him, and he won't do it.  That is not true.  I do what I'm called.  Because he's the executive.  He doesn't have to listen to you.  Right.  I forgot.  I forgot.  The reason why I asked him is because...  Chain of command.  ...is because the paperwork project that we're involved in was explained...  It's a project.  Yes, it's a project.  It was explained to Paul several times and not to me.  So Paul is the one that knows what to do with that project.  I was never explained what to do for that project.  You're just getting information. 
[04:04:00]  You're not asking for directions.  Correct.  If you weren't on the air right now, what would you be doing as executive intern?  Uh-huh.  I'd probably...  This second.  This second?  Yeah.  If you weren't on the air.  Eating chalk.  I would never do a thing like that.  Well, of course not.  Well, no.  That was a joke.  What would you be doing?  That was a joke.  I would probably be...  I'd probably be thinking of duties to give to other interns.  Like what?  Yeah, like what?  I just want to know what you'd be doing as executive intern right now if you weren't in 
[04:04:30]  front of that mic.  That's a really good question.  That's a really good question.  Oh, my God.  Why are you laughing?  Because it's funny.  David, do you see yourself more of an on-air guy?  Is that what your heart is?  You're an on-air guy.  As opposed to a behind-the-scenes cutting up audio on CS?  Yes, definitely.  Cutting up audio.  You don't need to learn to do that.  He has no desire to cut up audio.  I kind of learned how to do that at Connecticut Schools of Broadcasting, but when I finish  it, I'm like, oh, that's not for me. 
[04:05:00]  Is your last name Brent?  My last name is not Brent, no.  You've got kind of that vibe going.  My last name being Brent?  Yeah, David Brent from The Office.  Oh, I didn't get it.  I'm not as professional.  You got it.  You got it, yeah?  You got it.  He's cracking up.  He's cracking up.  He's laughing.  What's the type of laughs we have around here?  There's been a rape up there.  We do have to take a break.  We're like 20 minutes late.  Just point at the stuffed monkey.  Yeah, because of the executive intern, David. 
[04:05:30]  All right, David.  I don't have to say anything.  It's a scream.  Like it's madness all the time.  Here, Jerusalem bells are ringing.  Roman cavalry choirs are singing.  Be my mirror, my sword and shield.  My missionaries in a foreign field.  For some reason I can't explain.  Once you'd gone, it was never, never an honest word. 
[04:06:00]  That was when I ruled the world.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sirius 197, XM202.  The virus, Opie and Anthony.  This Kentucky man just hit an infamous milestone.  Henry Earl has now been arrested.  Has now been arrested?  A hundred and something times.  Milestone.  How many times he's been arrested?  Yes.  Or what for?  Oh, okay.  It's a milestone.  I will say 1,000 times. 
[04:06:30]  That would be impossible.  I'm sticking with it.  That's impossible.  Because I don't care if I win or not.  I'm going to go with it.  How can you go with 1,000?  I'm saying 1,000.  That's insane.  I'm saying 1,000.  It's not enough days.  It would be arrested.  1,000 times.  I read this story, and I can't remember if it's 100 or 1,000, but it's one of those.  I'm saying 1,000.  A hundred is easy.  Child support.  Holy moron.  He's thinking about what Bonnie's going to ask for when she leaves him. 
[04:07:00]  You just broke him up.  Yeah, of course.  Child support.  Yeah.  How many times she's been arrested?  How do you?  Let me ask you something.  How do you pay child support?  How do you say it?  How do you pay child support what?  How do you pay child support with comps from the hilarities?  How do you pay through the room and stuttering and muttering?  That was pretty funny.  She gets two for one.  1,000?  That's insane, Ed.  Come on. 
[04:07:30]  I'm going to say 1,000.  150.  Give me a real guess, Ed.  I'm saying 1,000.  150.  150.  Times arrested.  I read this story, and I can't remember.  Well, here it is.  Hit an infamous milestone.  Henry Earle has now been arrested 1,000 times.  Yes!  I swear, I just took a guess.  Right off the top of my head.  That's pretty soft.  I knew it.  Is that him right there?  All right.  That makes perfect sense.  Jesus Christ.  He has 1,000 different ways to cut his afro, too, I see in this photo.  Look at all of those mug shots put together.  Wow. 
[04:08:00]  He's been arrested two more times than he has kids.  Even though he said it was so uncomfortable.  I got something for Rich.  In honor of Rich.  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  Let's help out Rich.  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  Well, we'll try to get you back on board there, Rich.  Look at his mug shots.  Wow.  They're just scrolling along, and he looks like someone. 
[04:08:30]  He looks like everyone.  He looks like, what's his name?  Morgan Freeman.  That's hilarious.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Oh, geez.  What happened to him there?  That's nice.  Getting a little older.  He does look like someone.  He does.  Only in America, you could get arrested 1,000 times.  How do you get arrested 1,000 times?  He looks like all the roles prior played in Which Way Was Up?  Which Way Is Up?  Oh, he went with a shaved head there.  Yeah.  You know what?  All right.  They got a video of all his different looks. 
[04:09:00]  They should have done it like a flip book.  Yeah.  Like a lot faster.  Or morph them.  Or morph them.  I like that morphing.  That's a good idea, too.  Here's the rest of the story.  Earl has now been arrested 1,000 times, mostly for public intoxication and other nonviolent charges.  All of those arrests have been in Lexington.  Earl's latest brush with the law was Monday night.  That's when he was picked up for alcohol intoxication.  For the latest charge, a judge Tuesday sentenced him to 1,000 days behind bars for the crime, saying it was only appropriate. 
[04:09:30]  Earl has been famous for his extensive record.  He's been arrested 35 times this year alone.  A local TV station reports, in all, he's spent more than 4,000 days in jail.  On average, he's out of jail about two days before he lands back behind bars.  Earl also has been featured on late-night talk shows, and several websites are dedicated to tracking his arrest record.  Several late-night talk shows on BET. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah.  Go to that one shot of all the mug shots together.  It just looks like the opening sequence of this ****-y bunch.  Go to that.  Wow.  Wow.  Wait, of the what?  Exactly.  No, I want to watch.  Enough people got it.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no, that's terrible.  That's just awful.  No?  That's hilarious.  Wow.  Thank God for the beep. 
[04:10:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Saves us every time.  Who was living with 30 children of his own?  The youngest one in prison.  Told her one day when this dead meat met this hoe.  I knew it was much more than a trick.  That wasn't bad.  Oh, no.  There's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  Because I didn't have a clue. 
[04:11:00]  How this Jew would somehow ruin the fun?  No.  No.  No.  No.  That's the worst.  The worst.  What the fuck is it with you?  Are you professional or not?  Listen to Opie and Anthony live at Uncensored.  Weekday mornings from 6 to 11 a.m.  Oh, good for you.  The virus.  Sirius 197.  197.  XM.  XM.  202.  Fuck's sake, man, you're amateur.  Sure. </pre>
