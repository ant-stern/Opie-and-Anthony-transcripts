<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the recent deaths of Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett, focusing on the disproportionate media attention given to Jackson and satirizing the hypocrisy of figures like Reverend Al Sharpton praising him despite his past controversies.  The hosts speculated on the circumstances of Jackson's death, including his medication use and the paramedics' response, and reacted to listener calls and online comments, many of which contained crude jokes.  They also discussed rumors surrounding Jacksonâ€™s children's paternity and the false report of Jeff Goldblum's death.  The segment ended on a somber note with the announcement of the death of regular caller "Tippy Tom," adding to the show's overall theme of mortality.

The show then shifted its focus to Tippy Tom, recounting humorous anecdotes about their past interactions, including Opie's arrest of Tippy Tom for public defecation.  The hosts discussed the difficulties in identifying Tippy Tom's body and the desire to give him a proper burial instead of a pauper's grave.  Listeners shared their favorite Tippy Tom moments, and numerous audio clips of his appearances were played.  Comedian Lewis Black joined the show as a guest, offering his perspective on both Michael Jackson's death and the media coverage.  The segment concluded with plans for a Tippy Tom tribute show and the search for his next of kin.

Lewis Black's appearance continued with a discussion about e-readers, the US healthcare system (including Black's experience with hepatitis), taxes, President Obama, and the political system in general.  He shared anecdotes about his stand-up career, including experiences in Europe and a humorous story about a drunken colleague and a stripper.  Jimmy Norton revealed his role in an upcoming Kevin Smith movie, leading to a brief phone call.  The segment concluded with "FU" line messages, a return to the topic of Tippy Tom's death, and a comedic bit involving Tippy Tom seemingly passing out on air.

The show later dedicated a significant segment to Tippy Tom's death, announcing a three-day tribute show.  Judith Regan, a publishing executive, was interviewed; she shared her experiences with Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett, discussing their struggles with loneliness, abuse, and mental illness, and speculating on the factors contributing to their deaths.  Regan also recounted disturbing meetings with Jackson and Britney Spears, suggesting Jackson's child molestation allegations were unresolved and speculating on the psychological implications of his plastic surgery.  Another regular character, Bobo, offered tributes to Tippy Tom, followed by a rambling tribute to Michael Jackson.  A call from Tippy Tom's brother, Christian, revealed details about Tippy Tom's life, including past success, struggles with addiction and homelessness, and his bisexuality.  Christian agreed to provide pictures for the show and discussed funeral arrangements.  The segment concluded with pre-recorded audio of Tippy Tom and a highly inappropriate bit involving his soiled underwear.  The show interspersed laughter throughout these various segments.

[00:10:00]  of demerol the night before yeah i think i was reading about the demerol huh because his uh his  physician was uh at the mansion the night before too yeah take a look at him oh that's good  uh why why not go to the hospital because he's michael jackson have a physician yeah at your  mansion well let me uh let me get the family uh lawyer here brian oxman he's this guy's gonna  be everywhere i only keep an abortionist on call at my mansion it's a guy with a big black bag with 
[00:10:30]  hangers and a hoover and a brand new boot jesus are you okay are you good enough to climb these  stairs miss they're like those are morning after post shaped like flintstones  keep on call here's the jackson uh family lawyer jackson's family lawyer brian you're a friend of 
[00:11:00]  his do you have knowledge of what kind of physical condition he was in dead michael has always been  in very fine physical condition the one thing which has bothered me so much is the discussion  that one day he was going to be dead and this is is that i don't know if this is that day  i can only tell you that this is not something which has been unexpected any time there was a report 
[00:11:30]  because of the the medications which michael was under this family has been trying for months and months  and months to take care of michael jackson the people who have surrounded him have been enabling him  if you think that the case of anna nicole smith was an abuse it is nothing in comparison to what we  have seen taking place in michael jackson's life that's a bold statement no kidding damn 
[00:12:00]  wow well the autopsy would uh back that up right well it might that guy's got some powerful people  so did elvis remember elvis fucking died and uh you know oh well he had cardiac arrest that  yeah a bunch of fucking dope in him michael jackson might be from the same uh you know have that same  kind of uh security around him where people just don't don't even talk about it i do not know the 
[00:12:30]  extent of the medications that he was taking but the reports that we have been receiving in the family  is that it was extensive and this is this is something which i feared and it is something  which i warned about i don't know the cause of all this so i can't tell you what the the ultimate  result of it's going to be but i can tell you for sure when you warn people that this is what's going  to happen and then it happens where there is smoke there is fire this is a case of abuse of 
[00:13:00]  medications unless some other cause is involved which i don't know about wow what a dummy well  some are saying he's the family lawyer others saying he's just a spokesperson for the family  i don't know he's a spokesperson for the family because i don't think the family would want that  knowledge out right after he dies where's tito heraldo said that he or somebody said that uh 
[00:13:30]  he had these shows coming up and he hadn't hired one background dancer and one or one choreographer  which i don't know if that's true but if that's true and you got 50 fucking major shows coming up  and what was it like two months out or whatever and you haven't started rehearsing about a couple  weeks out oh is it a couple weeks out okay i think the first show was july july 13th something  like that i read a report out of 45 uh rehearsals he showed up to two of them wow really so maybe he  was just hooked on drugs and not i mean i don't know but that's to me that would that would cause a  person to panic you know they're all heading that way with the drug thing they're all coming 
[00:14:00]  out of the woodwork uh jackson's former publicist speaks out oh pretty much about the same thing  my name is michael levine and um i was michael jackson's publicist from 1993 to 1994 during  the first child molestation incident the good years the first thing that uh might be surprising to  people is this true sirius xm radio to pay tribute to michael jackson with special programming across 
[00:14:30]  its music uh music channels dude that was happening last night i was like oh let me check out if uh  what about the disney channel though are they doing anything  what are some of the other kid channels a bunch of kids singing ouch ouch  my name is michael levine and i was michael jackson's publicist from 1993 to 1994 during the first child  molestation incident i think the first thing that uh might be surprising to people is that i wasn't 
[00:15:00]  surprised by this um i had long thought that uh michael jackson was engaged in behavior that was  self-destructive and that could only end in a very inevitably bad and tragic way as it did today  you know uh michael jackson's hero musical hero was of course elvis presley and of course  elvis presley uh died at age 42 michael jackson now died at age 50 these are both 
[00:15:30]  monumental musical figures pop musical figures and uh both tragic deaths both having a great deal  of self-destruction at the root i think of both the tragic demands well i represented michael during  a very momentous time in his life this was the biggest international scandal story of its time  and uh i was a young man unprepared for the kind of intensity that i was uh you experience but um 
[00:16:00]  i think it may have been the beginning of a kind of unraveling to his such a many of uh aspects of  his professional and personal life they're all saying about him there's going to be a story  there is going to be a story to be told uh you want me to read some of these uh lines coming in on  instant feedback oh why not kick to the uterus for michigan writes uh macaulay culkin had identified the 
[00:16:30]  body afterwards at a press statement he said he hadn't seen mj so stiff in years oh i get it  i twittered last night that i was selling jackson four tickets cheap and i spelled cheap wrong 
[00:17:00]  c-h-e-e-e-p and then it overshadowed my shitty joke that's pretty good joke the jackson four  let's say hi to jerry and tito fred bill and teddy  tito jerry what's up jerry hey i was listening right after this uh happened with uh oh god  shep shep smith shepard smith oh shepard smith sure yeah they had uh greta van susten on there 
[00:17:30]  and she was just knocking the shit out of him slamming him saying how kooky he was and she used  the uh oh but you know for his family and everything and then she went right back into  her tirade about how what a nutcase he was it was pretty funny she greta kept saying that he was a  it was a freak show who was she was like you know like she's kind of saying like you know with all  due respect but it was a freak show yeah and uh it was a little uncalled for but you know look she  was right i mean you know it was a fucking day to me yes sir happy birthday buddy thank you sir 
[00:18:00]  michael jackson's death is overshadowing my special day yeah yeah he'd walk around with his  lily white children uh with with friggin masks over their face named one blanket he's crazy i think  he renamed the blanket kid did he yeah gave him the same name as his older son oh did he what  i think it was crazy i think there's a prince michael and then a prince michael the second or  something michael i don't know something like that fuck is dustin texas hey how's it going hey man 
[00:18:30]  uh yesterday was a contest between every attention get in media horror i knew him best you know i  remember one time or i talked to him recently you know he opened up to me the most in the last few  years and geraldo rivera was the worst of them oh just all day oh geraldo right because geraldo uh  what was he doing he defended him during that whole uh he did last molestation charges the entire day  the entire day is they crashed him i loathe geraldo well geraldo did get like the last interview with 
[00:19:00]  and yeah yeah i know i got it he repeated it like 67 times in an hour i'm surprised geraldo didn't get  in the ambulance and try to get some words out of michael on the way to the hospital no check this  out the best part is he's on fox news before they announced the death when uh l.a times was saying  it was a coma and he was like you know uh oh i'm not going to officially announce it but uh you know  i'm just going to say that it possibly doesn't look good but i'm not going to say it but i'm you know 
[00:19:30]  i do have a close friend but you know i'm not going to announce it because we're not going to  say that he is dead michael jackson is dead we're not going to say he is dead i am morado saying it  but i'm not officially saying michael jackson is dead even though i am going to say that it  he kept trying to find every way to say that michael jackson is dead without actually saying it yeah i  don't know what i don't know what goes on with the media because i was watching cnn's coverage 
[00:20:00]  but i was flipping around cnn coverage announced that he was dead about an hour and a half after  everybody else and they said we could finally say for sure it's like you're showing morals in the  media now yeah they're showing this guy when everyone is saying most people were saying he  was dead before they got him into the ambulance they said basically when he collapsed he was dead  tmz and fucking and drudge had it once drudge had it which was right after tmz i don't think they've  never had to pull and cultists they've never had to retract the headlines so yeah but they have it 
[00:20:30]  up it's pretty fucking solid but it's also seen as being you know conservative what what are you  doing they get sued for saying that though like is that everybody was saying that it was all over  all over tv except for cnn and then they said well we could officially say now that uh we got the  report from the coroner because it just made the media it made the news media look like so behind the  it really showed you how far back the tv news even was from the internet and it's like well is that a  legal thing where if they say he's dead he can you know the amazing story about the internet they said 
[00:21:00]  because of this michael jackson thing it's the internet slowed down to a crawl like it it it almost  shut down the internet so many people were you know on their twitters and their facebook well that  combined on the internet farah's asshole well no farah was only a piece of that really slowed it down  but they said it was the whole internet was really really slow and clogged up yesterday  when this thing broke facebook and twitter like slowed down to next to nothing and uh i was reading 
[00:21:30]  some reports that said that uh there hadn't been that much internet traffic since uh obama's  inauguration right right right really yep yeah uh one more thing real quick corraldo even said  you know uh right right before our last interview he was curled up in a fetal position on the couch  and i i sort of noticed that his little nose was held on by a piece of what looked like a piece of  paint double-sided and he's face yeah his face was falling off it was great that mug shot of him  in 2003 is yeah those are terrible those are his kids yes just stop it they are not his kids

[00:26:00]  you happy right yes i'm very happy actually did he get punched yeah very yeah just the only thing i  think he doesn't understand the world he lives in he's a snarky little douchebag you're gonna be  if you're gonna be drawing cocks on celebrities faces and drippy noses hinting that they might have  a drug problem yeah and cum bubbles guess what you might get punched in the face you idiot how  great i think it's funny though that he called the guy a faggot and and then had had to apologize 
[00:26:30]  it's like if someone else called someone else a faggot in anger like it happens when you're angry you  say stupid stuff that fucking little jizz bucket would be screaming for them to be fired from whatever  gig they had or to be removed from whatever place they could be removed from yeah and he gets  away with just going oh i'm sorry i was angry right right well well he fucked up with the michael  jackson thing too so did he i think perez hilton's days are numbered i don't i think he's uh i think  he's completely jumped the shark and he's gonna be on his way out within weeks uh heart attack or 
[00:27:00]  cold feet this is what perez hilton was reporting as this whole thing was going down yesterday uh we  knew something like this would happen michael jackson was taken by ambulance from his home to a nearby los  angeles hospital on thursday afternoon supposedly the singer went into cardiac arrest and the paramedics  had to administer cpr his mother's even on the way to visit him we are dubious jacko pulled a similar  stunt when he was uh getting ready for his big hbo special in 95 when he collapsed at rehearsal he was 
[00:27:30]  dragging his heels on that just like uh his upcoming 50 date london residency at the o2 arena of which he  already postponed the first few dates either he's lying or making himself sick but we're curious to see if  he's able to go on get your money back ticket holders and in the typical go unfunny shitty writer  fashion it's a sign of it he fucking puts exclamation points after everything why yeah  is he putting cum bubbles now if president had any balls he'd take that last picture of him in the 
[00:28:00]  going to the ambulance and put cum bubbles on it sure you might as well do that do that brave man  uh term man lightly let's say how to donnie that fruit donnie hey what's up hey hey i guess michael  jackson beat it you know how many times i read that last night dude do you think you're being  original like it's all right let's go to kevin and pa kevin morning boy hey kevin you know guys last

[00:34:00]  usually have a pretty good point they're sitting on the couch with johnny and ed i don't know what  farrah's standing up because she can't sit on the couch with her fucking tender bunghole  poor farrah and her chafed ass this just in farrah faucet is still dead farrah faucet but not many  people care today big fucking juicy tits big thing of baby wipes in her purse  just fucking popping those out every two seconds wiping looks like a napkin after you're eating 
[00:34:30]  ketchupy french fries time the king of pop had stopped breathing inside his rented los angeles home  fire department was first to respond paramedics performed cpr on michael jackson then they took  jackson to nearby ucla medical center at about 14 or about 2 30 in the afternoon mr jackson was  pronounced uh over at ucla medical center um about four o'clock this afternoon robbery homicide division 
[00:35:00]  was notified of this incident and directed by the chief of police to come out and handle the death  investigations since then the la coroner has taken over the investigation the circumstances of jackson's  death are not clear and the cause will be determined by an autopsy but his brother says medical teams  tried their best to revive the pop star it is believed he suffered cardiac arrest in his home  a team of doctors including emergency physicians and cardiologists attempted to resuscitate him 
[00:35:30]  for a period of more than one hour jesus and they were unsuccessful jermaine jackson also made a plea  for privacy for his family oh yeah that's gonna happen yeah good luck with that one you know that uh  cardiac arrest is different than a heart attack i i did not really know that i didn't either  cardiac cardiac arrest basically your heart just stops yeah in a heart attack part of your heart is 
[00:36:00]  you know having a having a problem yeah it just says fuck you and cardiac arrest you pretty much don't  come back from ever they said something like over 90 of the people just don't come back from  cardiac arrest when you're in uh when you're in that state they just showed the helicopter i think  the helicopter ruled it was a military fucking chopper yeah chopper now they're showing us uh dan in  brooklyn eight yeah yesterday uh they they interviewed some guy they're like cnn or fox news but when he saw 
[00:36:30]  the announcement over the uh the times square tv screen said there's a hush over times square  and he compared this to he'll remember where he was at like it was jfk's assassination who said that  some guy some yeah who they interviewed in uh times square awesome yeah well i would uh i would say that  michael jackson's death is bigger than jfk's death because this is a worldwide thing wow you're crazy  this guy they said was the most famous fucking human to ever live i think because he was known 
[00:37:00]  i think a few people knew jfk he's the president but jfk was the president of the most powerful nation  in the world he was just shot at a time i understand that but michael jackson pretty  michael jackson was known in every little fucking town in in the in the far east he was known all over  the fucking world if you would have checked out 1984 85 that's one thing this motherfucker has just  been like sitting there uh uh perhaps uh yeah his fame kind of you know yeah was was waning 
[00:37:30]  jfk's death changed i mean vietnam happened like really after that i mean that's yeah  this in the world yeah what's this gonna do this just knocked pharaoh off the front page yeah this  just like wow it kind of sucks yeah uh let's say hi to aj in california aj hey what's happening boys  hey hey uh cory feldman twittered last night he first got his uh first peaceful night's sleep in 24

[00:41:00]  spokesperson today everyone in costa rica is wearing patrick swayze uh rest in peace t-shirts  that's octa from toronto that's very funny oh that's so wrong  hang in there patrick you can do this yeah hang in there you're gonna need a month though my friend 
[00:41:30]  this is gonna be on tv for about a month that's a biggie then and then you know vh1 is gonna get a  hold of uh of the clips and play a bunch of that shit and then there's gonna be behind the music  and oh they already started all that stuff larry king i watched larry king last night  and man he doesn't disappoint what uh share his talent how would you describe it we what was he a  great singer yeah stop he didn't ask if michael jackson was a great singer yeah just stop it he did 
[00:42:00]  not just ask that how important is the voice would you say yeah what uh what was the moonwalk how did  he breathe up there no idiot he was an astronaut apparently  why did he wear the glove was he a great singer fucking asshole that's what he did  god they got a picture of him right there in the ambulance bob in jersey bob hey opie how you doing 
[00:42:30]  pretty good bob you say that uh michael jackson is  i know it well happened there i think i want to debate who was the most popular human being of all  time was michael jackson more popular in jfk no no nope yeah or ali he wasn't more popular than  i mean michael jackson ali more popular than michael jackson though absolutely you think i'm more 
[00:43:00]  famous without you got to think about where you could walk as a person michael jackson could not  walk anywhere on the face of the earth michael jackson without being known right right that's that's  where that's where i'm coming from he could not walk so you got to kind of put it in those terms  jfk same fucking thing not really because they didn't have uh the internet back then not everyone  knew what he looked like ah everybody knew what he looked like that's for sure what he looked like 
[00:43:30]  after the accident oh accident i call it a little oopsie oh yeah the oopsie wow shelly wade is on tv  talking about michael jackson from z100 was that who that is again all the experts on tv that was fred berry  god damn is she big uh-huh where are your weather girls  go ahead so michael jackson couldn't walk anywhere in the world couldn't walk anywhere in the world  i would assume that in his peak do you think muhammad ali right now ali ali ali right now i still say 
[00:44:00]  is more famous than michael jackson yeah he yeah he had the entire continent of africa was rooting for  him to beat uh foreman he yeah he's just he was he was bigger in every way he was bigger in every  way than michael jackson michael jackson a great entertainer he was that's the beloved now ali was  fucking uh jackson man i'm i'm just i'm just i don't know i'm just throwing it out there  everyone knows how huge ali was as well i think i think it's closer than you think jimmy um no 
[00:44:30]  because honestly no i'm not just being biased towards all i mean it's it's they're on that  level where it's it's it's just that level but no ali hasn't fought since 1980 right and he is  still that recognizable true i mean put michael jackson with a what is it 90 29 years from now 
[00:45:00]  well you know even ali's not dead but say 29 years from the last thing he did and see if he you know  if he is still as completely so when ali dies there'll be more coverage than what we're getting  right now no because ali won't be a shock ali is old right right right ali is seen as a guy who  lived his life it'll just be all tributes that's it's just so fucked up because this came out of  nowhere uh larry king continued last night with this with this fun little ditty and what what can 
[00:45:30]  you say i mean it's such a paralyzing story and there's so many depths to it of course the  investigation as was just pointed out by ted i think uh anderson and campbell that's going to go  on for a long while and the stories if you think uh the stories about uh the other lady that died  were big stories if you think the stories about anna marie were big this is gonna make it disappear  what all right larry we will be yeah she's like all right marie did he mean anna nicole yes of course 
[00:46:00]  you know just fucking leave the business give someone else a fucking chance at a gig  you fucking fossil and he talks about anna nicole smith like she just died to anna marie  albregetti i think that's like three years ago already yeah how important is the proper name  when you're broadcasting to a billion people ah he's talking to ryan o'neal how important is the  hiney when you're sitting the hiney how is anna marie's hiney faucet all right michael johnson dead at 50 
[00:46:30]  no jackson who yeah fucking dimwit what an ass it's just amazing right ah uh michael jack could  she make poopies in her last hours i think i know the answer to this one but michael jackson's death  bigger than john lennon's death uh very comparable i think uh but but again um i think the 
[00:47:00]  murder aspect boosted uh john lennon uh uh jim lennon when he was shot jim lemon plus lennon was one  of four michael jackson solo but he was one of the beatles just shot now i say lennon's story was  bigger and there was always that chance of a reunion until uh yeah lennon got shot and that was huge 
[00:47:30]  no one really gave a shit if the jackson five got together again uh look care let's go to matt in  atlanta matt matt hey matt oh roger yeah okay sorry roger what's up cleveland morning ladies uh i gotta  know how important is the heart that seems like a pretty important organ later gentlemen all right  uh let's go to blue and marie yeah marie idiot uh larry king uh cunning linguist from atlanta 
[00:48:00]  larry king andrew jackson dead at the age of 50 let's go to blue in houston blue  good evening hey what's up man all right what's the difference between michael jackson and neil armstrong  you know i'm sure actually did walk on the moon michael jackson touched a little boy that died  yeah i'm not feeling that has potential yeah you need a rewrite though you're almost there that 
[00:48:30]  needs to be punched up as they say in the business wait a minute but there's another guy doing the  exact bud the the trucker go ahead hey bud how important are the facts in the story  i was listening last night and i couldn't believe his neighbors were saying that they couldn't meet  him so they had to buy tickets to his concert and then the lady they were interviewing was crying and  saying it was a tragedy it's just ridiculous yeah a lot of people crying over this one it's just stupid 
[00:49:00]  unbelievable i got a one joke for you yeah uh mcdonald's is releasing a special michael jackson burger  uh-huh it's a 50 year old burger between two 10 year old buns  thank you sir let's go to phil in florida phil phil connors  did they call her faucet because her ass kept leaking 
[00:49:30]  and he's god see that's a perfect call  poor farrah's ass he just didn't get the coverage it's so duly deserved  well we have a bombshell today by the way oh yeah yeah that's really though we have a bombshell  ed mcmahon farrah michael jackson it doesn't end there people no no it gets worse it gets worse 
[00:50:00]  there's uh one more to add to the list that we'll tell you about after the break yes it's a bombshell  too it is it's gonna bum out a lot of people yep a lot of people bummed out uh everybody here  i got sad when you told me this morning terrible uh but first al sharpton comments on michael jackson  does he god i hate this guy michael jackson made culture except a person of color  way before tiger woods way before oprah winfrey way before baracko you're talking about a guy that 
[00:50:30]  didn't like being black so he turned himself into a white guy yeah what are you talking about  yeah why does the media continue to give this guy coverage they couldn't wait to get cameras in his  fucking face god he hated being black you dope he spent his entire life trying not to be black 
[00:51:00]  reverend al well before barack obama michael did with music what they let it be in sports  and in politics and in television and no controversy will erase the historic impact  now it might you know especially controversy yeah the controversy  i'll look at that you're just gonna you're just gonna like uh look past the little controversy that 
[00:51:30]  michael jackson had right but when uh uh you know a radio personality fucks up because he's trying to  be funny or entertaining you can't look past that right al god he's just a joke i remember he once  said to me can you believe after his trial he said to me they actually were showing on television  the cell they wanted to put me in i said well they didn't crown you the king and they can't take  the crown off your head finally i hope michael will get the respect he was due if he had shortcomings 
[00:52:00]  they didn't equal his strengths and if he brought days that we all hoped were days that would never come  again they didn't measure up to the most many days there are more days that he gave us of joy and  pleasure and he never forgot coming back to the apollo and coming back to the people oh did he really 
[00:52:30]  with his lily white skin exactly and his fucking aryan children the white lady he chose to be the  mother of his fucking kids right right you just don't stop it reverend al you fucking just get in  there and try to be a part of the story because you're a black guy just stop it reverend al disgusts  me we have as much claim to michael jackson now as you do exactly how does that feel you know something  let me make a statement as a white man he did great things in music uh he bleached his skin 
[00:53:00]  he had white children jesus he kissed elvis's uh daughter on stage and he dated brook shield and that  little webster child poor webster where's he poor webster well wait let's hear a quote from webster  i want to know what webster's saying today because he was the first uh kid oh my god start hanging out  working him like a ventriloquist dummy at that award show he had him on his fucking lap  who the fuck knows this reverend al is a joke though michael he came back to the people because 
[00:53:30]  michael jackson knew he can make a few bucks did he come back to the people just stop it  i do not know what the family's intentions are yet i certainly will be in trouble to bury him  whatever their intentions i remember when we suddenly without warning lost james brown  i brought him back to the apollo i don't know if his family will send michael back but we will  memorialize him yeah that's reverend al's new thing you p.s'd over there you dummy if you remember 
[00:54:00]  james brown it's reverend al's thing he gets the dead bodies of these pop icons and brings them  back to the apollo collect for a little look-see and now the whole set and now he wants to do the  same with michael jackson that ain't happening they might not send his body back i don't know  if his family will send michael back but we will memorialize him here and i will be wherever he is  don't send him c-o-d you hear this you like you said being part of the story yeah he goes no matter  what i will be wherever he is so he's gonna bury yourself he's gonna be six feet under you he's 
[00:54:30]  gonna be following the the the corpse of michael jackson the next few days lies in here and i will  be wherever he is to thank michael jackson for never forgetting us the fans that were with him from  gary indiana that knew him before the world knew him and when the world learned of him he never let  the world forget us he never stopped paying tribute to jackie wilson and dina ross and james brown 
[00:55:00]  and the people that came out of the apollo he bleached his skin stop it we should never stop talking  about michael jackson yeah he paid tribute to michelle pfeiffer who tried to look like her yeah  hush up now al oh al is adult is he the worst for some reason they still eat up his shit though  do they they sure do they get those cameras right in his face i hope they bring farrah's asshole  right in apollo theater what about farrah cut it out with a parent knife and send it here like an 
[00:55:30]  apple core i'm gonna be following her rotten asshole around the country wherever her rotten  asshole is i'll be poor farrah's ass it's gonna be like a little a little display like the pink  panther diamonds you can look at it oh god damn poor farrah yeah this is nothing today let's go to  matt in north carolina matt what's up boys hey matt um what about uh elvis priestly don't you think 
[00:56:00]  his death was um a lot more yeah a lot more recognition well um hard to say i mean it was big  though elvis you forgot elvis just dropped dead not fucking go anywhere in the world without being  known elvis couldn't walk anywhere and elvis is going to fucking some shitty atoll in the south  pacific and be known i say michael jackson bigger than elvis wow i so see it i tell you why because 
[00:56:30]  now you're talking like a crazy no no no because you're like this place is in africa and tribes  where look elvis didn't resonate i'm sorry but i mean michael jackson is is recognizable  like you said he can go there's nowhere in the world he could go yeah even elvis because elvis never  i don't think elvis ever performed outside the country because he hated the fly i say elvis way  bigger to michael way bigger yeah he's been dead for 30 years and he's still selling that's true 30 
[00:57:00]  years dead and that motherfucker's still at the top of the list of uh of shit that gets uh sold every  year yeah i'm not saying elvis isn't bigger like as far as selling more albums total bigger  i don't i still say that uh michael more recognizable than elvis i say elvis yeah i say elvis  now though probably not thank you elvis is just a skeleton but wherever you go  his jaw dropped wherever you go michael jackson could not go there are places elvis could have gone 
[00:57:30]  where he wouldn't have i mean literally there are villages that don't have running water  where michael jackson couldn't go because he'd be swarmed by people i don't think elvis had that  as big as elvis you know it's still again it's still it's an interesting question that's a  fucking i just i just know that hide their kids like anne frank when he came into town  you're gonna see a lot of full playgrounds today the kids are coming out to play today 
[00:58:00]  with no fear in their eyes kevin in kentucky hey good morning boys hi welcome back a little jimmy  thank you hey uh last night at uh larry king's midnight show he was at uh he was interviewing  p diddy and he kept calling p daddy p daddy yeah  larry king is a dummy he stinks he is just an out-of-touch dolt  enough with him yeah p daddy all right let's say hi to dan in michigan dan 
[00:58:30]  hey good morning boys good morning dan hey one thing you missed on that news report is when they  talked about how they resuscitated him uh can you imagine giving him out the mouth and having  a pinch his nose it's like when you get a cracker stuck in the uh the cheese and the top breaks off  pinch his nose and the whole nose crack off holy shit it took me a second to put that one  together visually this god yeah all right uh doug new hampshire doug yeah revin al said that he had 
[00:59:00]  more strength than his weaknesses i just wondered how many number one hits you need to equate bouncing  little boy's nuts on your nose yeah yeah that's just true right what negates that i just am amazed  how they're just praising this guy all over tv and ignoring all the uh controversy like he gave  back to the black community oh fucking no shut up al he didn't he alienated the black community like  oj did and uh just decided he was gonna uh bleach his skin or vitiligo whatever the fuck you call it 
[00:59:30]  he was all in in the white world yeah all in got a nose job and got rid of his traditional african  american features of his lips and his his nose uh uh his hair his big afro hair he never allowed it  to get curly ever again never again since what the mid 80s you're telling me that this is a man who  embraced his africanness shut it thinned his nose yeah he made his lips red yep completely non uh what 
[01:00:00]  you think of a black man having his lips and he did it on purpose yeah yeah he did it uh through  surgery look at that picture up there oh so you just missed it where you had the glasses and the  fucking uh and the uh like the alec baldwin hairdo which is it's just completely a white guy's hair  they're trying they're trying to have a uh farrah fawcett versus michael jackson battle on tv  popping her in every so often but farrah fawcett is losing no uh elvis has sold over a billion record 
[01:00:30]  units jackson has sold 750 million that had a jackson also had a long time too very interesting  though jimmy it's close is it yeah but don't forget elvis i'm not really close elvis is still  way ahead but that's a pretty impressive number elvis had a bunch of years more time and he's also  been don't forget he's also been dead though elvis is still selling yeah i it happened i i think 
[01:01:00]  michael jackson's uh sales will slowly diminish as time goes on and and and at a faster rate than  elvis and don't forget elvis has i mean there's like 50 at least elvis records that you could  purchase i mean i think the jackson catalog is a little more limited yeah that's true so that  makes that number all that more he's got them big fucking albums you look at thriller how many  fucking how many copies of thriller the album was 32 million in the u.s in the u.s for real yes  32 million i think it's still the biggest thing i sell them of all time got gotta be right yeah 
[01:01:30]  wow it was the biggest i liked off the wall yeah it was a good um  thriller had some hits on that motherfucker prince's die bigger what oh yeah that was a big  yeah you know what just questions coming in prince's die dying was a fucking big one too  hitler bigger than jackson uh hitler was kind of knowing i don't think hitler could have gone 
[01:02:00]  anywhere when he did wreaking havoc yeah he went in a tank let's say hi to rich in uh la rich  uh hi my boys hey rich hey i heard that when the paramedics went to michael jackson's house they  perform ups on them giving him a upa all right everyone's got a funny line don't they well our  exclusive michael jackson coverage will continue continues and again uh ed mcmahon who died a couple

[01:08:30]  terrible making a bit about it it's not a bit it's not a bit it's kind of a guessing game yeah  but uh yeah lost one of the biggies it's not jeff goldblum  who just threw that in the ring though so like hey jeff goldblum's dead you might as well say  ran with it you might as well say because coke logic and a bunch of others have it they already  got it oh yeah now it's coming like crazy uh really anthony who have we lost well i believe 
[01:09:00]  uh the person closest to him who brought him to the program should make the announcement officially  uh in studio right now for the official announcement of one of our uh great losses here  is keep the cop to uh tell us morning what happened yes we're all morning okay oh good morning okay 
[01:09:30]  or not oh you are yes yes i always make that mistake i'm sorry uh yeah it seems  a couple nights ago uh unconfirmed report came in at work yeah about uh someone very close to us on  this show yeah and uh after doing some research and making some phone calls i did find out uh late  last night during the rest of the breaking news that tippy tom has passed away tippy tom dead 
[01:10:00]  yeah we were very upset about this we were trying to find him recently yeah and and and it uh  it turns out tippy tom has been dead for a month uh yeah tippy tom passed away i believe may 6th he  i believe he was right got fell got really drunk  or had a regular day and uh fell down downtown about i think 14th street and 6th avenue went to the 
[01:10:30]  hospital and they took him and uh he succumbed to his injuries where did he fall on the street or  yeah he wasn't beaten no no he apparently he he fell down yeah drunk fell down hit his head  and what did he hit on just the concrete yeah so then uh when he passed away he you know he got  brought to the morgue and he to this point has yet to be identified he's been frozen for a month they 
[01:11:00]  put him in a refrigerator he's been there in the morgue almost two months yeah two almost two months  he's been in the refrigerator in a morgue yeah so uh you know i finally spoke to them yesterday and  they said that he's getting you know uh right well right uh yeah to the basically with tippy  probably smells better as he decomposes which jesus come on he would love this first in recorded  history he would love this but uh yeah so it's getting very close to the the point where he'll be 
[01:11:30]  buried in new york city's potter's field potter's field for those of you who don't know is where they  put people that are unclaimed unknown uh the john does of uh the world that die here in uh new york  city are buried in a uh just a nameless grave site potter's field and they just bury him oh my god  we're looking we're looking at a lot of great videos oh my god there is dancing at one of our live 
[01:12:00]  appearances oh my golden buns shaking his ass jesus oh my god  he was the best never gave a bad performance never that guy was brilliant every time he was on our show  as far as all our players yeah he was the best i think i i don't even think it's uh up for debate  no no he was the greatest tippy tom we've had some crazy people uh help us with this radio show but 
[01:12:30]  none better than tippy tom is gone now what uh what are we doing as far as trying to find next of kin  because now what is the protocol here he needs to be identified right by a family member right yeah  that even like you know him you could go down there but it doesn't matter right even though officially  in my capacity i've known him since uh 96 right when my my first experience with tippy tom was uh  as i was riding my bicycle for the police department down one of the streets downtown i observed him 
[01:13:00]  shitting in between two parked cars and uh at that point tom i actually did i did arrest him that day  for you're dead yes yes you put him on your bike in front of the handlebars she's hanging over  shit on shit in your little cop basket yeah oh yeah so uh you know but then of course like  everybody else like like ziggy in in the past i mean i i grew to love him of course my family and uh 
[01:13:30]  i i looked out for him for many years and uh i was yeah very very sad yeah to hear it but uh very sad  yeah they will not let me identify even though like i said i've known him that long uh and at one  point we did have his brother's phone number here at the show i guess his brother had heard him on uh  when we were on terrestrial radio yeah heard the show and uh steve still still did have the number 
[01:14:00]  and i spoke to his brother last night and you know informed him what happened to him we're gonna  arrange for him to come in and and uh make the the identification but at that point apparently you  know he's in financial straits and his you know this is kind of like alcoholism was something in his  family his mother died from alcoholism his sister died from alcoholism and his brother's not in too  good a shape financially and everything so i mean i don't know if there's anyone out there in the new 
[01:14:30]  york new jersey area who works in uh the uh funeral home business or anything can give us an idea of  what it would cost to yeah to kind of uh you know give him a good send-off yeah maybe we could chip in  get the listeners to uh chip in some cash and uh and uh bury the guy with a little bit of dignity  uh instead of uh in potter's field there give him a little headstone says tippy tom on it yeah 
[01:15:00]  golden buns we were just talking about him yesterday golden buns i sure can yes i could too  they should bury him upside down with his ass sticking out friends could drop by like someone  else who just passed away wow that's uh that's a bummer yeah yeah that was definitely uh a little  much and uh 53 years of age 53 years only 53 53 holy shit there he is drinking uh bud light in the 
[01:15:30]  studio um i i am running away from tippy tom because and i'm spraying with lysol there i am spraying with  they did mention in the autopsy something about chemicals uh in his system oh really cleaning  product cleaning products like lysol perhaps uh i was responsible there i i am i have a cloud i'm  watching a video where i put tippy tom in a cloud of lysol as he's trying to get at me i will not have 
[01:16:00]  him near me what an unnecessary death though yeah hey we tried to fall on his head like we got him  cleaned up once yeah that's when he actually sounded very gay in the hospital it's like hi it's tippy  tom how are you guys yes i'm here they cleaned me up just the way i remember uh the he did a phoner  from his hospital bed yeah yeah broke his leg and just every word that came out of his mouth was 
[01:16:30]  flamingly gay yeah he was like wow i was walking down the street and and it was we were amazed it was  the same guy amazing so they've taken care of me here yeah and then it was just bye  well i want to dance on stage  well i think uh we should open up the phones and because everyone wants uh you can request 
[01:17:00]  your favorite tippy tom bit oh yeah you know we got the short versions of most of them i mean we  start with this one obviously yep let's see how this comes out all right they're right there all right  here we go  this is a story about a man  and he always was so lonely at night  but his voice was rowdy 
[01:17:30]  you can hear it all through his train station and i'm gonna sing this one  this is about tippy toe tommy  let's go where we go  where we go where we go  it's late that night  and now you have nowhere to go  and money's gone and off to all my friends  and the cop says to me

[01:29:30]  Danny's bummed over there.  Danny is for real bummed out.  Danny was more close with Tippi than I think any of us.  Tippi was probably my favorite person to ever exist.  He was just so much fun.  It was all about fun with him.  He was funny.  He was definitely funny.  Always in good spirits.  Guy never had a bad mood.  Yeah, he was never in a bad mood.  Never.  He would get cranky if you tried to wake him up.  I know there was one time he fell asleep at the old building on the toilet.  And we had to get him out of the car. 
[01:30:00]  I think you were with me, Keith.  It was very, very difficult waking up Tippi Tom off of the toilet.  I think that somehow they enacted a new rule in the building after that happened.  That was when Tippi told me, he goes, Tippi Tom has tummy upset.  Boobie man from Brooklyn.  You have to play at the time Tippi screamed.  You told me I can jerk off on this day.  Yeah, that was a classic moment.  When you find good shit, just let Danny know.  We'll pop him on as we go here. 
[01:30:30]  Al in the Poconos, Al.  Hey, boys, what's up?  Hi, Al.  Hey, Al.  Oh, man, Tippi Tom, rest in peace.  But, you know, he was a man of wisdom.  He taught me history.  He taught me the most important thing history could teach you.  The Germans were wrong.  Yeah.  The Germans were wrong.  Oh, when he cried about Sophie's choice.  We're going to have to, because we just found out today, or I found out today, we got to  get a whole Tippi Tom show together in the very near future. 
[01:31:00]  That is a day off for the boys, man.  The Tippi Tom tribute show.  Anthony from the compound rules.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Chris Joe in Georgia.  Chris Joe.  CJ?  Yeah.  All right.  Good evening.  Hi.  Well, I've been watching Tippi Tom bits almost every week for the past two years.  This is a tough, blow, boys.  And I just have to say that his death is about as unnecessary as his life was.  Jesus. 
[01:31:30]  A hell of a tribute.  All right.  Travis has some other ones that are worth playing.  Which one do you want to do?  Last words on the show?  Wow.  Let's start with that one.  No, and I'll just use my finger, and we'll just test you for blood, and we'll check out  your prostate.  Oh, all right.  Pause this.  Yeah, this is Dr. Steve, obviously.  Well, obviously giving him a prostate.  Yeah, giving him a prostate.  But Tippi Tom is bent over and as naked as naked is.  Ready to get the big finger up the ass.  Right.  I forgot about this. 
[01:32:00]  Go ahead.  No, and I'll just use my finger, and we'll just test you for blood, and we'll check out  your prostate.  God bless Dr. Steve.  Check the, so you can put the finger up your ass, right?  Is that okay?  Yeah.  Will you rotate a little bit?  Oh, that's good.  Oh, that's good.  I'm afraid.  Come on, you're fucking on my bed, Tom. 
[01:32:30]  Chippy Tom with Line of the Day.  Thank you.  The next time I see you on the street corner, you're in a lot of trouble.  Rotate it.  We've got to get the part where the digit goes in his hiney there.  That was brilliant.  Rotate it a little bit.  Yeah.  God damn, man.  Please play Gray Wolf Shelter Me.  We did already. 
[01:33:00]  We can play this, though.  The Opie and Anthony Institute of Art and Literature is proud to present a collection  of books on tape, soulfully voiced by the homeless, Tippy Tom.  I can't do as good as a guy to do it with, you know.  Masterpieces like Herman Melville's Moby Dick.  Call me a smile.  Some years ago.  Never mind how long precisely.  And Dickens historically themed A Tale of Two Cities. 
[01:33:30]  It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times.  It was the age of wisdom.  Doing a good job.  Okay.  You won't believe your ears as Tom mutters and fumbles his way through Mark Twain's classic,  Huck Finn.  Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was under the window Douglas' protection. 
[01:34:00]  Okay, I guess I'm getting around.  And then be prepared to have your breath taken away, literally, with his read of Great Expectations.  Heaven knows we'd never be ashamed of our tears, okay?  Of course not.  Anyway, I think I got sort of it right.  And finally, you'll enjoy the classic for all ages, Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham.  Great eggs and ham. 
[01:34:30]  No, green eggs and ham.  See, I can't see one of my glasses.  I am Sam.  I am Sam.  Sam, I am.  Come on, man.  I got my damn glasses on.  Who even knew Tippi Tom had glasses?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's a collection of some of the finest literature ever written, and then read by a homeless drunk.  Order Tippi Tom Books on Tape today.  Tippi Tom, everyone. 
[01:35:00]  God damn.  These are fantastic.  Christina in Indiana.  Christina.  Hello, boys.  Hey, Christina.  I was just thinking, poor Farrah Fawcett with this whole Tippi Tom thing and the Michael Jackson thing.  She's not going to get any coverage for her death yesterday.  Hell fucking no.  No.  More people calling about Tippi Tom than Michael Jackson on our show, by the way.  More famous.  Not even close.  On our show.  More famous.  He eclipsed Michael Jackson.  Please.  Absolutely.  No contest.  We were just talking about him yesterday, Danny. 
[01:35:30]  Yesterday.  Because Barry Madelow might be coming in here somewhere later.  I know.  We had a bit ready to go, man.  Oh, it's dog, Bagel.  Bagel.  I used to walk his dog, Bagel.  He had a dog named Bagel.  Travis has that clip, if you want it, where Dr. Steve inserts.  Oh, yeah.  We got to play that out.  Go ahead, Travis.  Just kind of touch your ankle there.  Just kind of bend over.  You going to do this?  All right.  Let's listen to him.  I'm up here now.  Come on, man.  Get ready.  Oh.  All right. 
[01:36:00]  Here we go.  By the way, we never had to pump up Tippy Tom's stuff.  No.  That was him on the horn.  That was, I mean, his comedic timing was, it was perfect.  Brilliant.  It was perfect.  That blew my mind about him, that no matter how drunk he was, he was able to come in and 
[01:36:30]  hit the post every time with whatever we needed him to do.  Rick in Louisiana.  Rick.  Hi, my boys.  Hey, Rick.  Hey.  Hey, I'm not too sure what Tippy Tom tripped over.  Was it Natasha Richardson?  What?  Watch it out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  She wasn't even there.  Peter in Massachusetts.  Peter.  Good morning.  I had two quick ones.  One time, Opie, you wanted Tippy Tom to hug Anthony to make up with him because they 
[01:37:00]  were fighting.  Right, right.  And then Anthony was trying to spray him with Lysol to get him on him.  Yeah, we were just watching that video.  The Lysol videos were classic.  There was a cloud of Lysol in the studio any time Tom came in.  And then you guys found out he lost his life over, like, drinking and gambling.  So you had him come in to play 21 with Anthony, and Anthony loaded the deck.  Yeah.  For beer and money.  And then Tom got a 20, and then Anthony pulled a 21. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  That was all set up to fuck him over.  We've got to figure out which bits to play, and we're going to do a whole Tippy Tom tribute  show in the very near future.  We have to just figure it out.  Thank you, sir.  You're welcome.  All right, man.  Let's go to Craig in Jersey.  Craig.  Yeah, hey.  I own a funeral home in New Jersey.  You guys have got questions.  Do you want me to bury this guy?  Yeah, you're cool.  How you doing?  Well, we've got to get the body, first of all.  Right.  So we've got to get Tippy Tom's family to claim the body.  Okay.  He's been dead since May 6th, Keith was telling us. 
[01:38:00]  Your best option is probably Cremate.  That's what he might guess.  Yeah.  No open casket at that point?  It'd be a lot of work, and I don't think so.  Yeah.  If you saw the guy a lot, you know.  I wonder if the brother would give us a little bit of the ashes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't want the ashes.  A little bit in the studio?  That's ghoulish.  I'd rather have a nice picture that says, you know, the day he was born, the day he died.  I'm one of those guys.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  I'm going to talk to his brother after the show today and give him the information.  But if you can, I guess, hold the line afterwards and give Travis or somebody your information,  if I could reach out to you.  He was a legend.  I'd be more than happy to help.  He was a legend.  I think we could do a little memorial.  I think the fans would come out in droves.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  We'd have a party for Tippy Tom.  That's what he'd want.  I'd be willing to do it for nothing.  We'll put it that way.  Damn.  We appreciate that, man.  Thank you so much.  We'll certainly plug the business a little bit.  You know that.  Hey, I'm willing to help. 
[01:39:00]  We'll take care of each other.  Thanks, Craig.  All right, bro.  All right, man.  Let's say hi to Ben in Jersey.  Ben.  Hey, guys.  Hey, I was wondering if we're going to send Keith out to watch over the next homeless.  Make sure they don't go.  Well, you know what?  We lost the biggies.  We lost Ziggy.  We lost Tippy Tom.  We lost Blue, I think.  Blue, yeah.  Yeah, we lost Blue.  Which one was Blue?  The black guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, we lost him about six months ago.  We lost him.  I didn't know he died. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  As far as the homeless shopping spree, I mean, we can't do it without these guys.  They were the stars.  No, they were the stars.  So.  Which one was Blue?  I remember.  I remember the, he was, wasn't he keep cursing when he was on the air at K-Rock?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and he thought we were bringing him to jail when we were trying to do something  nice for him.  What did he die of?  Yeah, same, same sort of thing.  Same thing?  Kind of fell down?  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  God, that's something.  All right, well.  They sure fall down a lot, don't they? 
[01:40:00]  They sure do.  They don't get back up.  Travis, you got something to play going to break?  Uh, yeah, I got a lot of stuff.  No, I mean, like a Tippy Tom thing?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, trust me, it's all about Tippy.  What do you got?  Uh, well, we got a lot of production, or, I have, I have him, uh, reacting to Two Girls,  One Cup.  You want to hear that?  Yeah.  Or, I have Pat Duffy Tippy Tom mustache.  Uh, the homeless, yeah, the homeless, uh, shit mustache, yes.

I'll tell you right now.  He's outside the studio.  On mic, yes.  Don't feel good.  I got tummy upset. 
[01:42:00]  And so what I'm saying is that.  If he blows a fart, it's over, Johnny.  Because I love you and be well.  We're going to get busy.  It's going to get right.  Now, I'm saying Tippi Tom is going to belt one out.  Uh-huh.  All right, Tippi Tom is going to belt a song out.  I should back up.  Come on.  I want to sing a song. 
[01:42:30]  Come on, Rummy.  I want to belt one out.  I'm going to sing a good song.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Oh, you're going to get along.  We know you're going to sing.  Sing.  We're going to sing.  All right.  Let me belt one out.  All right.  Tippi Tom will belt one out.  All right.  Softly.  I will leave you softly.  Long before your arms can make me wait for one more hour. 
[01:43:00]  Come on.  Who did that?  Or one more day.  Is he complaining that someone farted?  After all the years.  Perfect for Frank's voice.  Come on, guys.  You're fucking me up, man.  That song was awful.  You don't even know who we're fucking saying.  Yeah.  What song is it?  You don't even know. 
[01:43:30]  I know.  It was that guy who does those songs.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, right?  I'm right, though, right?  Yeah.  I can't bear the tears so softly as I leave you there.  As I leave you there.  Sean Fanson?  Who sang this?  Who sang that?  Can you do some Frank Sinatra?  Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  About time.  It is about time.  You need another shot before you do Frank Sinatra? 
[01:44:00]  You're fucking right about time.  It's about fucking right.  Get the hell out of here.  Where is it going?  You're fucking right.  Yeah, go.  Get out of here.  You're fucking right.  That's right.  Go.  The Virus.  Sirius 197 XM 202.  Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment you've all been waiting for.  The very funny host of their own daily radio program, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Will you please give your warmest welcome.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome.  The world famous Opie and Anthony. 
[01:44:30]  That's right.  Opie and Anthony, what a day, what a day, what a day.  Everyone talking about Michael Jackson, sort of talking about Farrah Fawcett, and really  talking about Tippi Tom.  Yes.  One of our own is gone.  We learned this morning that he died May 6th.  Tippi Tom gave us, I don't even know, hundreds of hours of great radio over the years.  He was the star of the homeless shopping spree.  Danny is severely bummed.  I'm really bummed. 
[01:45:00]  The more you listen to his shit, you're like, God damn it.  Everything he did for us on the show was gold.  Never had a bad appearance.  Nope.  We were all just really excited to have him back, because he hadn't been in in like a  year.  Yeah.  And we were trying to figure out what to do with Tippi.  Like, we wanted to do this whole wine tasting thing, where we'd get Tippi in, and he has  both cheap and expensive wine, and he would elaborate about the wines and the palates.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a whole bunch of Tippi things floating around.  And then to get this terrible news, just really schooled his house.  Remarkable bouquet.  Yeah.  We're going to have a Tippi Tom tribute show, and we're going to try to get some kind of 
[01:45:30]  memorial together, because no one's there for him, so we're going to try to do the  right thing, and get him out of the morgue.  He's been just sitting there since May 6th.  Well, not sitting.  Well, he's laying down.  Laying, right.  And we'll figure it all out, so just keep listening to the show.  You know what we should do?  Got a Google bomb.  Tippi Tom died.  Let's make him number one on the Google Trends today.  That's going to be a tough one today.  Good luck.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How the fuck? 
[01:46:00]  You know what?  Good point.  Michael Johnson.  All right.  Well, we'll give it the old college try.  Let's at least see how high we could get.  Tippi Tom died up on the Google Trend today.  Yeah.  What am I saying?  In our world, it's way bigger, but not in the world.  Can we get Iraq in here, too?  Because I want him to do something.  Yeah.  Where is Iraq?  I was taking medication.  My mercury was very high from all the sushi I eat, and they gave me these pills I had to  take twice a day, and they smell weird. 
[01:46:30]  I'm done with them now.  I did take them already, but it's called a clinical...  Did you feel weird with all the sushi you were eating?  You feel sluggish, tired.  The mercury makes you...  Yeah, I stopped.  Yeah.  I'm down to sushi once every two weeks.  Once a week is okay.  I used to be three, four fucking days a week with that sushi shit.  Wow.  And the mercury fucks you up like that?  Yeah.  Hell fucking yeah.  Normal mercury is a five.  Selfish.  Was it five?  Mine was a 44.  Whoa.  I swear to God, it was really bad.  The fuck are you doing chewing off thermometers? 
[01:47:00]  The rest of my blood was very good, believe it or not.  Jesus.  Tippi Tom died.  Google that like a motherfucker today.  Where's he around?  Poor Tippi.  Let me say hi to Mike.  Mike?  Hey, what's going on?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I want to thank Tippi Tom, even though he's passed on.  I was just dropping my girlfriend off at work, and she threw up in my car listening to the  doo-doo mustache.  Ah.  You know, we're only playing really quick clips. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, when we get the tribute show together, it's going to be amazing.  It'll probably be one of the biggest listens ever, as far as the Opie and Anthony shows go.  But with the doo-doo mustache, I mean, we pulled out a piece of fucking shit from his  underpants that was hard as a rock.  It was petrified, and we were banging it on the table.  Oh, yeah.  And the thing didn't even come close to breaking up.  It's like a rock.  The thing was, a few of us held it, because it was like, it wasn't doo-doo anymore. 
[01:48:00]  It was a rock.  Yeah.  Fossilized shit.  Oh, it was disgusting.  Tom's underpants were a horror show.  It had to be put into water to kind of rehydrate it so he could make a mustache.  Just to try to make a mustache, like you do with an old Indian rock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of those paint pot rocks.  That's the Central Park Jogger on fucking Fox.  Wow.  What's she doing there?  She looks pretty good.  That's the fucking Jogger. 
[01:48:30]  Like, why has she ever seen him before?  No one's watching TV for her today.  No cares.  They're watching for Michael Jackson.  Where is Z-Rock?  You asked for him, and he's still not here.  It's fucking, I don't know.  Oh, here comes bitch hips.  Evan.  Oh, God, that walk.  And here comes Z-Rock coughing as he walks.  Of course.  He's still coughing.  What's wrong with him?  Or he just smacked Derek in the head?  Here he comes, taking forever.  That hallway is just too long. 
[01:49:00]  Why are you still coughing, E-Rock?  And it's 747 on that hallway.  Were you coughing or chewing food?  I'm chewing food.  Of course you are.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  What is that, your cud?  Turkey bacon.  I love it.  In the old tippy-ton videos, you were pretty thin there, E-Rock, I noticed.  Yep.  You don't care, though, right?  Those are some good old days.  Turkey bacon's good, though.  It's a little better for you than bacon.  It's good.  I love that you don't care anymore, but what about your fiance? 
[01:49:30]  Does she care that you don't care?  I think she's giving up.  But what is that going to lead to?  Like on everything?  The marriage and everything?  Is she still way into you?  Time to time, depending on what I'm eating.  Oh, God.  She'll lean in and go, and how many Jell-O cups is that?  The pudding cups?  I go, you're supposed to eat one of those.  Yeah, well, I was up to three at that point.  Oh, God.  One of them is not bad. 
[01:50:00]  60 calories.  They're okay.  You get a little taste.  You get a little dessert in you.  The dark chocolate raspberry ones were really good.  Those are...  God damn it, are they good.  You have food in the back of your hand, E-Rock.  That's horrible.  Oh, E-Rock.  I was taking this medicine for too much...  I saved this.  I want you to smell this.  Could you hold on a second?  Sure.  Oh, hi.  Oh, my God.  Did you hear that?  Michael Jackson died.  It's so amazing.  Waving.  Yes, give me a...  I was taking this medication for too much...  Mercury. 
[01:50:30]  Mercury in my system.  I had to take this twice a day for a month.  Two pills a shot.  Four pills a day.  And it smells bizarre.  And it smells like a...  It's...  It's...  I don't know what it is.  But it's actually dietary...  Smell the inside of that jar.  It's not that bad.  It's just weird.  It's empty.  I took the pills.  But it's actually what I was taking for a month.  What does it smell like?  Let me smell that too.  Wow.  Wow.  E-Rock.  You all right?  That smells like bed...  Like pet food.  Let me smell.  It's a weird fucking... 
[01:51:00]  Oh my God.  Rotting sauerkraut.  Right?  Oh, that's a good one too.  If I had had the fucking pills still in there, it was even stronger.  That's why I wanted to bring it in today.  It's terrible, right?  Yeah, it's awful.  E-Rock, what are we doing for Tippy Tom?  You must have farted like far away taking those.  No.  We're sketching it out in the back for next Friday.  For the weekend.  We're going to have the big Tippy Tom tribute show.  Next weekend?  Next weekend.  Fourth of July weekend? 
[01:51:30]  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Ah, nice.  Really?  Yeah.  We're going to do three days?  Yep.  We've got plenty of stuff for three days?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Why don't we do it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday?  And you've got more clips for me today?  Yeah, we have a few more in the let there with Travis.  Wait, you guys are highlighting Homeless Pyramid where Tippy blows the game.  You want to play a piece of that, Danny?  Yeah, we got...  I think Travis said it's like 30 seconds.  All right, listen to this.  You've got 30 seconds, Papa Rock, to make Francine say what's on the paper, okay?  He's thinking...  All right, what is it?  Whisper it to everybody, Jimmy, out there. 
[01:52:00]  Things on a plane.  You didn't hear that thing, Francis?  Things on a plane.  All right, here we go.  Here's Papa Rock.  Go.  Stewardess.  What?  Airplane.  Things on a plane.  Oh, wait a minute.  But it wasn't you.  Tippy Tom blurted out the answer and it wasn't even his turn. 
[01:52:30]  When it was his turn, he couldn't figure out how to play the game.  No, the second it wasn't his turn.  He figured it all out and just blurted the answer out.  The greatest part of that clip is when Papa Rock says stewardess and you just hear Tippy Tom go, what?  Yeah.  What?  Keith's got some info.  Keith?  Yeah.  I just talked to his brother and we might get his brother in on the show a little later.  He has to call.  I guess Tippy Tom's dad is still around.  His mom passed away a couple of years ago.  We knew that. 
[01:53:00]  Wait, you're telling the brother?  The rest of the family doesn't really know yet?  I told his brother last night.  Right, right.  And his brother's going to go about letting his dad know.  And he said he hasn't never even met Tippy Tom's son, but he's going to try and make a couple notifications.  And he's going to talk to the funeral home, Craig, who called us.  And we'll try and work out all details and put this thing together.  And his brother said he will try and call later on.  Maybe we might get him in before the end of the show just to get him in. 
[01:53:30]  Well, talk to him on that.  Talk to him on, you know.  Tippy Tom's brother never wanted to talk to us, though.  Yeah.  You know, I just explained to him how, you know, everyone's kind of stepping up.  And I told him that, you know, we might do a memorial thing with this guy, Craig, who offered the services.  And I said, in the event that we do this, you know, you might end up with thousands of maybe, you know, fans that come to pay their respects.  And he was pretty taken aback that it, you know.  If we do a memorial, it'll be as big as the homeless shopping spree.  People will come out of the woodworks for that. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  So, and, you know, we have our friend Billy who's offered, you know, to spread his ashes on his boat around Manhattan.  And, you know, there's a lot of things that we could, you know, do to, you know, pay our tribute to Tippy Tom.  So, hopefully, his brother is all for it because, you know, everyone loved him.  All right.  Let's go to Wes.  We got the trucker.  Yeah, we're going to get to him in a second.  Wes, the trucker.  Hey, Hopi.  What's going on, man?  Hey, buddy.  I think it was the end of January this year, right after that motocross guy died in Costa Rica doing that trick. 
[01:54:30]  You called it, man.  You said 2009 is going to be the year of the death.  You called it.  Oh, we've had some big ones already.  Show related.  Fucking, you know, and the rest.  Michael Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, sure.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Will there be a website for donations?  As long as it's not costing that much, we can probably handle this one.  Why make the listeners pay?  What the fuck? 
[01:55:00]  We do that every day.  All right.  Lewis Black is outside the studio.  We're going to continue with the Michael Jackson thing, the Tippy Tom thing.  As Lewis makes his way into the studio, I want to just play another Tippy Tom bit.  We'll do this one right here.  This is what my body, and you think I'm sexy.  Come on, baby.  Let me know.  Lonely?  You're damn right.  Looking for the time of your life?  Are you single?  Hygiene?  Not an issue.  Hepatitis C, which I've had for 20 years. 
[01:55:30]  Sit back, lube up, and dial Tippy Tom.  I'm a slut.  He's homeless, smells like a dumpster, and he's horny.  Yeah, you lick my b***h.  For a bottle of Thunderbird, he's all yours.  I'm a human being.  Okay.  I want a b***h.  Guys.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot when I was two years old.  Girls.  I call friends, too.  He's so drunk, he doesn't care.  All right, who's next?  Just name the place, and he'll be there. 
[01:56:00]  I'm behind a dumpster or something like that.  Call 1-900-SYPHILIS for the ride of your life.  I know how to shake my bed.  Not responsible for any diseases contracted as a result of sex with Tippy Tom.  You're damn right.  Our tribute to Tippy Tom will continue, but we have Louis Black in the studio.  What's up, Louis?  Yes.  First observation, how long have we known you?  Ten years?  Longer, man.  Okay.  She's like 35.  We're aging like motherfuckers, and you stay the same. 
[01:56:30]  What the fuck's going on with you?  That's true.  Well, I think it was because I'm older, and when I was a kid, I was eating stuff with preservatives.  Oh, it's just kind of...  And they healthied up your diet, and thereby taking away, you know, I think that the pounds of preservatives.  You're like Benjamin Buttons.  That stupid movie.  What kind of colonia are you so good?  I have something not very nice for you. 
[01:57:00]  What is it?  It's good.  It's Paul Sebastian, which is going out of business.  Is it really?  That's good stuff.  It is good stuff.  I'm a human air wick.  Oh, it was Creed.  Just on a side note, we were driving into work today, and this music was cranking here in Midtown.  They were setting up for some band, and we were all trying to figure it out, and it is Creed.  They're playing right outside this fucking building right now.  Oh, that's a treat.  Yeah, no care.  I thought they hated each other.  I've got to run.  Yeah, you want to catch that one.  So what do you think of the whole Michael Jackson thing and the coverage? 
[01:57:30]  I have no...  What's your thoughts?  I don't care.  It's literally like mourning.  It's like if a freak died in the sideshow at Coney Island.  Gee, the kid with the three heads passed away, and he was one of the greats.  We've never seen a freak like him.  Exactly.  It's unbelievable.  I mean, it really is.  He's not...  Look, I get it.  The music, everything.  I just think we have become, in the last five, ten years, really obsessed with a story. 
[01:58:00]  And we glom on...  Like that Kate and John shit.  Oh, don't go there, Lewis.  No, I'm not going there.  I'm just going there.  That one hurts.  How great is that story?  Come on.  Let's go, Lewis.  It's a shit story.  Why?  It's a shit story about a shit family and who gives a fuck.  Who cares?  Yes.  People live across the street from you, you asshole.  You got to turn on the TV to watch them?  Yeah.  They're down the block.  How many fucking times have you watched...  I mean, how many friends of yours got married and had a kid in order to save the marriage? 
[01:58:30]  They had eight.  Eight kids.  By, by, by, like two?  You don't know?  You don't know four minutes into the...  You're out in the first state, you're having a cup of coffee, you don't know it's going  to not going to fucking work?  I'm supposed to mourn this?  But it's like this story after story after story.  I was gone for about three weeks.  I was in Europe and touring there because I'm looking for more shit, different shit to  talk about.  European shit. 
[01:59:00]  European shit.  And what's great about there was just I went, you know, what is this?  What's going on?  What's the difference?  How come I'm waking up and I feel like I got some space?  Because, you know, A, I don't understand what these people are saying, so there's no  assholes in the area, you know?  And B, we don't have to wake up to this, yeah, yeah, yeah, this endless...  Well, they're pretty bad with the pop culture in Europe.  Oh, they really are.  They're even worse in the papers.  England is.  Yeah, England.  They're looking for, you know, a picture of Michael Jackson's corpse so they can put 
[01:59:30]  that right on the front page.  Well, yeah, well.  They're actually worse there.  England's really terrible.  Yeah.  But I don't know what the rest of Europe is.  But the rest of them, you know, if you pick it up, you don't, you know, if it's in Dutch,  who gives a fuck?  They know you in Europe?  Can't read it.  They actually...  So I'm confused.  They know you.  No, they don't.  Lewis, I'm confused.  Yeah, they do.  I'm confused.  Are you Team Kate or Team John?  Jesus Christ.  I'm in for the end of the Learning Channel.  That's what I'm at.  The Learning Channel rules. 
[02:00:00]  Because it's the modern day freak show.  It is the modern day freak show.  We've talked about this on the air many times.  What are you learning from it?  Yeah, it's all just freak shows.  It is.  It's unbelievable.  And they believe we're, you know, we need to learn about this stuff.  And then they'll just call it the La Channel.  It'll be the L.E. Channel.  The way they kind of shorten it.  Yeah, yeah, to make it more hip and relatable.  But this Michael Jackson thing, this doesn't happen every day, Lewis.  This is pretty amazing stuff.  This is like when the king died himself.  What?  When Elvis Presley died.  No, Elvis Presley was the king. 
[02:00:30]  Right.  Michael Jackson left my life 15 years ago.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, after, you know, by the way, which surgery did you decide?  I can't watch this anymore.  You know, when his nose disappeared.  They're saying that his nose was being held on by tape.  That came out recently.  No.  That's some bad.  Now it's just hanging.  Here's the story.  Here's the I think I've even told this to you guys before.  But the Michael Jackson story, may he rest in peace, was that a friend of mine who has no, you know, carries no grudges is a guy who works in the technical end of theater. 
[02:01:00]  And Michael Jackson, this is years ago.  It's like maybe 15, 20 years ago.  Michael Jackson's at the Plaza Hotel when the Plaza was a hotel.  And he's holed up there for like two months.  And and a whole bunch of techies from the city were asked to go in and move.  You know, they had they were moving the stuff out that he had brought in with him and putting it on. 
[02:01:30]  And what what was around this is before any of the news broke about the kids and before he had children.  But scattered out throughout the entire like three bedrooms were gap kid model.  You know, the the what do you call those mannequins, the gap mannequins of kids dressed in like those.  Come on.  I'm serious.  Wow.  And this is a guy who it'd be first of it'd be a stretch for him to think it up.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's not the type of guy you go, wow. 
[02:02:00]  When did he get that creative?  It was like, you know, he was never just that.  There was never there wasn't a chance he'd come up with this on his own.  And he had to take the clothes off the kids.  That was all.  And he was like, this is really not addressing child mannequins.  Yeah.  That's great.  You know, and he's doing this to supplement the money he's making in the theater.  It's, you know, now that's a story.  But this is it's just, you know, they gather.  They get one.  I mean, look, I just don't get it. 
[02:02:30]  It's not, you know.  There's nothing really to get.  He was a freak show, a creep, a weirdo.  And what is that monkey?  What happened to the monkey?  And he died out of nowhere.  Oh, where's bubbles?  Where's bubbles?  Don't expect him, Michael Jackson, to just die.  Yeah.  Bubbles together.  I was shocked he was 50.  You thought he was older?  Younger?  I thought he was younger.  Probably younger, right?  Because if he's 50, then I'm really old.  Someone on CNN said, this is perfect.  This is how it was supposed to be.  Because no one could imagine Michael Jackson as like a 70, 80-year-old guy. 
[02:03:00]  No.  No, but I couldn't imagine him anymore.  Yeah, at all.  How do you imagine somebody who's really not there?  And just a weirdo.  And then, you know, he's going to set up in Qatar.  Well, look at this.  On the news right now, they've got memorials in L.A.  Gary, Indiana, at his childhood home.  I'm sure he was back at his childhood home.  At the Apollo Theater.  Yeah, look at that childhood home.  Holy shit.  No wonder Joe Jackson beat the shit out of those guys and said, get back to the studio. 
[02:03:30]  Joe Jackson didn't want to live like that anymore.  Fucking get in there and sing, motherfucker.  What a lunatic he was.  Gary, Indiana.  He's like, fuck this Gary, Indiana.  We need to live better.  That's one of America's profound shitholes.  I'm amazed you and I never played that, Jim.  I'm surprised.  I probably sell very well in Gary, Indiana.  And then Harlem's tribute, even though Michael Jackson shunned his blackness.  Well, they loved him when he was a kid.  Yeah, that's what it is. 
[02:04:00]  Up through, I guess, Thriller.  When he was black.  He had some work done by Thriller, though, also.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  But it wasn't the bizarre fucking hatchet job that they did on him toward the end.  Can I tell you how passive-aggressive I am?  I was in the airport yesterday.  I see Lewis's paperback.  He's out in paperback.  Me of little faith.  And I picked it up and I was perusing it.  I just couldn't bring myself to buy it.  Because he's my friend.  Please tell me you threw it in the garbage.  I put it behind mine. 
[02:04:30]  It's not even in paperback.  No, I move him around.  Why aren't you buying his book?  Because I just can't buy a book that my friend put out.  Yeah.  I have to get it for free.  Yeah, same here.  I just scum that.  Yeah.  The book did very well.  Now it's in bestseller.  Now it's in paperback.  Now it's in paperback.  What did you add to the paperback?  A lot more shit.  Yeah?  Not a lot.  But basically, they go, I was so irritated because you write the first book.  And then you think, well, they didn't say anything about editions.  And then all of a sudden, they call up about three weeks before it's going to go to print 
[02:05:00]  again.  And they go, oh, we really need you to write some extra stuff.  Oh, shit.  But I said it all.  Really?  I said it all.  Really?  You want me to start thinking about it?  You know, you couldn't tell me at the time.  But it's a great concept.  You put out a book.  And then they resell the book with just a few extra pages.  Yeah, exactly.  And people buy it.  Yeah, but I say in the book.  People need the hard copy and the paperback.  But I say in the front of the book, you know, that's what they've done.  And you should sit down, actually, if you're in a place and just read a couple of extra 
[02:05:30]  things.  Yeah.  And move on.  And move on.  Did they really write that?  Yeah.  Are you doing signings?  I'm doing signing.  I did a signing here on the Upper East Side.  There's a jumbo Barnes & Noble there.  Yeah.  I said it was great to be in a, that Barnes & Noble had so much faith in the printed  word that they put another billion dollars into a jumbo place.  It's huge.  Really?  I've been to that one.  86 and Lex.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's unbelievable.  It's pretty much a whole city block, Jimmy. 
[02:06:00]  Really?  It's extraordinary.  I love Barnes & Noble.  Yeah, well, you'd love this.  Oh, jam.  I do.  I love a big bookstore.  No, you'd love this one.  This one is massive.  And it's amazing because you go, wow, you guys, you don't see the writing on the wall.  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah, right.  Because people are finally figuring out how to download that shit, too.  Exactly.  The Kindle.  The Kindle.  The Kindle.  The Kindle's one of the hottest items out there right now.  But, I mean, I need a book in my hand.  I can't read it.  Yeah, absolutely.  I just don't get it.  I mean, it's, but I do think eventually the way it's going.  It hurts your eyes, man. 
[02:06:30]  No, no, no.  The Kindle doesn't have a light on it.  I burn.  The Kindle, the Kindle is not an LED.  It's got no false light.  They say it's pretty much like reading a book.  You have to buy an outside light to put on it.  Yeah, for real.  So it doesn't do that to your eyes.  The first one sucked, but supposedly the latest version.  The one that I saw, Adam's got one.  Dubin's got one.  I got one.  I got it for my birthday.  I just haven't opened it up yet.  It's different.  It's totally different.  I heard.  Like that Sony book, which was also like, oh my.  You know, it just gives me a headache.  I get like computer hangover. 
[02:07:00]  And, you know, the beers.  But I sit there.  If I'm working on the computer all night, I wake up the next morning.  Like today, my eyes are burning.  I don't think God intended us to read words from a computer screen.  It's a television screen.  Yeah.  You know, and just because these pricks can't figure out how to combine the computer to the TV.  What fucking nonsense is that?  Are you reading off your fucking phone?  That's even worse.  Holy shit.  That fucks my eyes up horribly. 
[02:07:30]  I'm just close to grandfather glasses.  It's amazing, you know, Kathleen Madigan, another comedian.  She's like, she will read.  I said, where'd you read that?  And she goes, well, I read it in the, you know, I go to this website in the morning.  I read off my BlackBerry.  How the fuck do you do that?  It's bad.  It's disgusting.  Tiny.  It's just like.  I fucked up my LASIK.  No.  I got the LASIK and I was down in 2015.  There's no fucking way I'm anywhere close to that anymore. 
[02:08:00]  Your eyes tugging.  And I'm squinting again.  No shit.  I went years without squinting because I got the LASIK.  Can you file suit against BlackBerry?  Have we got a case?  I'm thinking.  Can we move on?  You want in?  Can we move on to a better life?  It's like the optic rab.  Oh, yeah.  Damn, these glasses, son.  All right.  So, Lewis, you don't like the Michael Jackson thing.  What's going on in your world that you're paying attention to?  Iran?  Obama?  No.  No.  I'm like at time all.  Plane crashes?  What do you do?  I'm doing that time off.  I just got out of here for a while.  I want them to figure out health care. 
[02:08:30]  And I want them locked up.  All of them.  And I want them not to be able to get health care.  Really?  Every one of those fuckers.  Yeah.  Every one of those fuckers who sits there in Congress and pontificates on either side.  You don't know shit.  You got the best insurance in the world, you douchebags.  And then you're going to pontificate about the way the insurance companies are on?  Fuck you.  And fuck them.  And if you're going to make health a profit-making institution, fuck you twice over. 
[02:09:00]  It's not oil, you fucking idiots.  It's a fucking, you get a shot.  Figure out how to make it cheap.  Fuck them.  I had to go to fucking public clinics.  Fuck you.  I actually pissed into a cup something that was akin to Coca-Cola.  Because I had hepatitis.  You got hepatitis?  I had way back.  Way back when things were shoddy.  Uh-oh.  And that was really my turning point with health insurance. 
[02:09:30]  I was in a clinic on...  I was living in the East Village.  This...  Can somebody play some music?  Hepatitis in the East Village.  That's like...  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  No.  That's a guarantee right there.  I was there.  You know, and...  And I went into this clinic, because I'd been like three days of like, you know, you get  a fever and you go, okay, and then...  Yeah.  But it was different.  I was like, no matter what I did, this was not going away.  Oof.  So I walk in, and I'm like, I barely make it.  And the woman's like, you know, go get your... 
[02:10:00]  Go take a sample.  You know, the doctor says to take a sample.  I go to take the sample.  I come back to see the...  I've just pissed.  Coke.  And I come back.  Oh.  And the woman is sitting there, and she said, well,  we're going to have to wait a few days until the tests come back.  And I put it down, and I said, I don't fucking think so.  I'm pissing Coke, okay?  And if I'm pissing Coke, and I can make a profit off of it.  Jesus.  But, you know, but that's the way you kind of go.  I believe that's the one that irritates me. 
[02:10:30]  Whenever you have to give a sample, do you know what I do?  I make sure I fill it right up to the tippy top.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  I'm like, fuck you.  Here's your sample.  Right to the top.  I go way past that line.  Fill it on your fingers.  Right.  Have fun with this sample, you motherfucker.  Throw it all over you.  If it's going to cost me a couple hundred bucks, you're going to have fun with my urine.  But it is amazing.  I've got three kids.  Three kids.  Three health insurance companies because of the union stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  And all they do is fight over who's... 
[02:11:00]  There was literally the first year that...  I mean, I finally got, like, the insurance.  And I had SAG and AFTR, like, film stuff and TV stuff.  And all they did was fight over who's going to pay...  Who's your primary?  Yeah.  Who's your secondary?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How brilliant is the co-pay?  How do they figure that one out?  Yeah.  You're fully insured.  Like, well, the co-pay will be...  But...  Yeah.  Sorry about the co-pay.  What does that mean?  How the fuck do they come up with that and get it past us?  Yeah.  No, it's all...  If you're insured, you should be insured.  Fuck the co-pay, I say. 
[02:11:30]  It's unbelievable.  And they won't figure it out.  And all they do is sit and natter on about it.  And then they...  You know, whatever they say they want to do, then somebody is going to have to get taxed.  And they won't tax.  So, I mean, we just...  That whole argument, too.  We just came through eight years of just flushing money down the toilet.  We have no money for fucking anything.  And they're going, well, we can't really...  I mean, you know, California's broke.  Yeah.  Because states, they're broke.  They got nothing.  And nobody's...  Everyone's broke. 
[02:12:00]  No one's in the condition or position right now to be taxed more.  Right.  It just really hurts.  You know, but you can.  There's certain people who can fucking get taxed.  I can be taxed more.  More?  Yeah.  I have no kids.  You know, I mean, they just make it.  Literally.  I don't have kids.  Yeah.  I don't have a wife.  But I have my fucking money.  Yeah.  And I want to keep it.  Yeah.  I want to spend it on fun shit for me.  Yeah.  I mean, with that tweet...  But you and I have always disagreed about that stuff.  I'm already a 50-50 partner. 
[02:12:30]  What more?  I want to...  I'm giving more than I fucking make.  No, you shouldn't be a 50-50.  17% is fair for everybody.  I like Schwarzenegger's.  40 fucking...  ...6, whatever it is.  It's...  It's not 40.  ...half my fucking money.  No, it isn't.  It's because you live in New York.  Yeah.  It's 33%.  Whatever it is.  Federal, and then you add the state.  Well, then you add the state.  And then my tax is from the county I live in.  Well, get out of that county.  And then every fuck...  What am I supposed to do?  Move to goddamn Alaska with a fucking stupid bitch up there?  You get to move to Florida.  What a treat.  And then what they fucking leave you with, every dime you spend of it is taxed on something 
[02:13:00]  else.  I went through my phone bill the other day, and we were laughing our asses off at the taxes  and surcharges that we had no conception of what they even meant.  Oh, yeah.  There are words on there about surcharges and taxes that you're paying on your phone bill  that no one questions.  It's five bucks here, ten bucks here, three dollars, eight bucks, but it adds up to like  over fifty dollars in these taxes that are for stuff that has nothing to do with phones. 
[02:13:30]  It's like fucking tire tread tax.  If you go to Vegas, you know, and you're not just...  You don't bump enough downstairs if you're in the casino and you get the bill from the hotel.  It's the amount of...  They've got like twelve taxes.  Yeah, yeah.  All hotels are doing that now.  Occupancy tax.  Occupancy tax.  I'm paying to occupy the room.  That's the goal of what you do.  That's your business.  I pay you. 
[02:14:00]  I occupy the room.  So what is an occupancy tax?  And the occupancy tax basically goes to the people who will then advertise to tell you  to come back to the place.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, if I just...  Can I not pay the tax and tell you I'll be back next year?  And this is beyond the sales tax you pay on the room.  So it's beyond that.  So you're paying an occupancy tax.  What the fuck is that?  And I love an excise tax.  I have no idea what that means.  Well, you know, they just kept adding on.  Just tell me.  Just, you know, just... 
[02:14:30]  And don't, you know, just say it's going to cost X.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't need to know.  I don't need to see it.  Don't break it down for me.  Don't break it down.  It's just going to piss me off.  It's like the first time I flew U.S. Air and they'd switched over to charging you for  a bag.  Oh, right, right.  For like a...  And you couldn't...  You had to have cash outside in order to do this.  They wouldn't take a credit card.  Right.  And then inside they'd take it.  But you're standing on a line.  It's like, really, couldn't you...  You couldn't ask for the 12 bucks. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  You know, I'm flying a plane, schmuck, so we know we've come down the road a little  economically.  Couldn't you just ask me for the 12?  It's...  Yeah, what's $12 more on a ticket?  Yeah.  And that's...  Which creates more chaos in that hellhole.  They could...  I really think airlines can make money just by jacking their prices up.  Like $6 on every ticket.  Yeah.  Six bucks.  Because who's really going to notice it?  No one.  Nobody.  Just don't call it a tax.  Nobody.  You know, I mean... 
[02:15:30]  People have stopped paying attention to a lot of it.  Call it a fuck you tax.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  We're taking the money.  It's not going to anything.  It's not paying for any shortfall that we have or anything.  We just want six more dollars from everybody that flies on our fucking plane.  Yeah.  Please be honest.  Fuck you.  Fuck you tax.  It doesn't sound like you're a big rah-rah Obama guy, then.  If he doesn't mind paying more taxes, that's not Obama.  But I...  That's not Obama.  That's really...  No, I understand, but I thought you'd be more like Obama, but it's not... 
[02:16:00]  It sounds like you're kind of disgusted with the system in general.  I'm disgusted with everything.  Yeah.  I mean...  Oh, yeah.  Lewis has never been, like, one party...  I'm not really...  You've always just been disgusted with the system.  Yeah.  I just think that these people are...  I mean, it's absurd.  I mean, I have to say the one thing I do have to say about him that I do like is he  actually talks.  He actually speaks.  He turns around.  He actually seems...  Look, even if he's fucking faking it, having someone who seems to be concerned is more  amazing. 
[02:16:30]  But Clinton had that.  Yeah, and Clinton had that.  Yeah.  The problem with Bush is eight years of somebody who wasn't really comfortable in his own skin.  Yeah.  And that gets to be creepy the fuck after a while.  Now you see him?  Oh, is he having a time at that ranch?  Now he's...  I know.  Now he's...  Oh, he's smiling.  He looks great.  He's like, fuck you, people.  Here's my shit.  Take it.  It's like...  It's like the fucking guy that came to your house for a party, destroyed the house, and  just left, and your parents are coming home.  That's what George did. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, later.  But my favorite thing is, way, way back when we were talking about this, that you still...  The thing that keeps coming back to me is about this...  Sometimes when I'm interviewed, I'll say, well, I was on the O&A show years ago, and Anthony  had really the solution, which was to go after Yemen.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck Yemen.  Yemen.  They kept on their own shenanigans after a while.  Yeah.  They kind of proved that they're, you know, not to be trusted very much. 
[02:17:30]  But that was very great.  Yeah, yeah.  The Yemen solution.  Let's go after Yemen.  We could all get behind that.  No one really likes Yemen.  You just get right behind that one.  Now we got...  We got...  What's happened in Iran was pretty fantastic.  The old iron fist finally came up.  They're like, yeah, we'll give them their chance.  Let them talk.  What?  They're saying, okay, crush everybody.  I thought they were going to cut a deal.  I mean, I thought, you know, the moolahs or whatever they are, that the guys on top 
[02:18:00]  were going to cut the deal.  I mean, it's not like you're getting some unbelievable character, you know, Mr. Demi.  It's not Thomas Jefferson.  You're getting a guy who's just not going to hit people in the face.  He's going to yell at them, but he's not going to hit them.  And he's going to say, fuck you, but he's not going to kill them.  What a transition.  It's like JFK is coming there to run the fucking place.  No, it's not Camelot. 
[02:18:30]  It is.  It's unbelievable.  It's amazing.  So where are we at with the Iran thing?  Everything is now?  Yeah, no.  They're sort of going back to where it was.  Yeah, they killed about 40 people.  Yeah, they shot everybody.  Did they put down the protest, though?  I mean, they're still going.  Oh, yeah.  No, they pretty much...  They squashed it.  Oh, they killed them.  Except for Twitter.  Yeah, yeah.  That's Twitter, boy.  I don't Twitter, but...  You don't Twitter.  Do you guys Twitter?  Oh, we all Twitter.  Yeah, Louis, sorry.  How could Louis Slack not Twitter?  I'll tell you how fuck I can Twitter. 
[02:19:00]  I'm not that interested in my goddamn life.  You don't social network at all?  What network?  I got fucking 40 of them already.  I need another one?  Yeah, fancy.  I got one where they fucking went through my fucking book and just took names and started  shooting emails off the people saying Louis was welcoming you to this shit site.  Here come the Farty Bobo shit site.  Went through my goddamn fucking address book.  Farty Bobo.  We got Bobo down in the hall.  You want to meet Bobo?  And it's in that...  It's in there. 
[02:19:30]  You're on Twitter?  It's right there.  No, I'm not on Twitter.  Is that a fake voice plot?  It's a fake fuck.  And you don't want anything to do with it?  No.  Why not?  You got followers, Louis.  Well, you know, and who knows who's Twittering?  Maybe their life is more interesting than mine.  Yeah, I love that.  It's just to me, I'm over here, I'm buying some pickles.  Who gives a shit?  Another cup of coffee.  We agree with that.  I went without cream this morning.  Yeah.  Hope it works out for me.  And you're like, who gives a flying fuck?  Yeah, I mean, I'm... 
[02:20:00]  That was cool for the first two weeks of Twitter.  And then you gotta...  Yeah.  You gotta step it up.  We gotta punch it up now.  Pictures and videos and shit.  Yeah, I mean, it's got the goddamn energy.  Fucking Busby Berkeley musicals I'm putting on mine just to keep people central.  You know, I mean, fuck, if I was interested in that, I would have been an audiovisual  AIDS guy in high school.  Yeah, the AV guy.  The ones who'd come in, I always used to feel like they were Nazis.  They were like Nazis in hiding.  You know, they all wore the same fucking outfits, the white shirt, you know, the khaki pants. 
[02:20:30]  Pen holder in the pocket.  Pen holder, exactly.  Come in, roll it in.  They all knew how to work that projector.  No matter what went wrong with it, they could fix it with a pencil eraser.  Just shove it in there.  When the film started going, and jumping, they would shove an eraser in that.  I like the dancing hair.  Yeah, oh yeah, that was a good one.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you get the dancing hair in your film strip.  You've wondered where it came from.  Yeah, no kidding.  It was fucking the projector.  They just have a flat screen behind the little pull-down map. 
[02:21:00]  And that's...  And yeah, you throw on the DVD.  All right, we've got to catch up with breaks.  We've got Lewis Black in studio.  What's the big plug today, Lewis?  The paperback's out.  The book is out.  I read the book.  I loved it.  Thank you.  I loved it.  It was one of the...  I don't read a lot of the comedy books, but I read yours.  Well, this one's kind of like, it's just about, you know, it's about religion.  Yeah, but there were a lot of laughs in there, man.  Well, thank you.  A lot of laughs.  The title's wrong.  It's supposed to be Ye of Little Faith.  Yeah, it says me of little faith, and as you praying, it seems like it's about you.  Yeah.  That's the whole concept.  It's a misprint on every copy. 
[02:21:30]  That's how you know you're not an author, when they put your face on the cover of the book.  I'm sure of it.  Our books, and Jim's books...  I was very...  Stephen King never has to put his face on the cover.  Yeah, you don't go Stephen King.  You see him in the back of the book, you know, he tells you a little bit about the author.  Wearing a black turtleneck or something.  Lewis got some great quotes, though.  Lewis Black, the most engagingly pissed off comedian ever.  Stephen King.  Oh, shit.  Wow, speaking of fucking...  You met Stephen King?  No, he wrote it in...  He just wrote it in some articles. 
[02:22:00]  He was writing about the fake Twitter guy, though.  He finds that guy hysterical.  Stephen King loves pop culture.  Yeah.  We want him on the show just to talk pop culture.  We can't get it done.  Really?  You can't get it done.  Whenever I'm asked, who makes you laugh, or who would you pay to see, I don't hesitate  for a moment.  Lewis Black, period.  He's got it all.  Brains, balls, and shops.  George Carlin.  But George is dead.  He couldn't have wrote...  I was older.  I was older.  I got it just before.  Yes.  Who do I have? 
[02:22:30]  Fucking my quotes.  Jim is funny.  Bob Levy.  Hey, Jim Norton's great.  Well, you know, he's a good guy.  It's not funny if you enjoy a Route 280 in New Jersey.  Colin Quinn.  I mean, it'd be...  You don't want to tell you to write about the Muslims in the book, though, Lois.  What the fuck?  I didn't want to.  You barely touched on them.  It's supposed to be about all religions.  Yeah, but I wrote, really...  You know what I wrote about?  I wrote... 
[02:23:00]  There's nothing in there that I didn't know.  That I didn't know about.  I didn't hang out with Muslims.  Lois wants to keep his head.  There was a lot of job, his head.  You've got to remember, you know, I was born and raised in the suburbs of the United States  in the 50s.  There were barely black people there, let alone Muslims.  Muslims.  I don't think Muslims have been allowed in the country at that point.  Yeah.  I was not going to...  When that guy did the cartoon and then they...  You know, they're chasing what's-his-name around.  Who's the...  Salman Rushdie. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, I mean, these guys don't have a...  Screw them.  I have no time for that.  You don't have a...  I have no interest.  Breaking news.  Danny, go to ismichaeljacksonalive.com.  Wow, there's already speculation that he's not dead.  Right.  People in this country are fucking idiots.  I love the times we're living in.  It doesn't matter.  And what comes up?  Maybe no.  Click here.  What are they saying, Dan?  What are they saying on ismichaeljacksonalive.com? 
[02:24:00]  Pulling a Tupac.  Yeah, sure.  And a Biggie.  And an Elvis.  Well, someone's got to pull the fake death thing eventually.  Yeah, yeah.  For real.  Someone's got to really pull it off.  Yeah.  It just forwards to some other social networking site.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  It's junk mail.  Let's not get more attention today.  All right, Lewis, we're going to continue with you in a few minutes here, all right?  I got to go.  He's a busy man now.  You're one of those guys now?  I'm stuck with that.  He's like Sinatra on Carson.  Yeah.  They would just say, Johnny, I got to go.  You can't go.  Yeah, that's what got me. 
[02:24:30]  What is it?  I don't even know.  WPIX11?  No, no.  It's down the hall somewhere.  Oh, another one of the stations.  You're leaving us to do another show in this facility.  That's what they put.  No, you're not.  That's what these guys do.  No, you're not.  That's what these guys do.  No, you're not doing that.  That's what my life is now.  They lead you around.  They lead me around like the little porker I am.  Come on, money-making machine.  Let's go.  Yeah, here it is.  Go to this.  Go to that.  Need our percentage, fucko.  Get into this room.  No, they're unbelievable.  The first time we were selling the book, I named, it was you. 
[02:25:00]  I said, for starters, this is it.  But I go on O&A for a long time, and Todd and Tyler out of Omaha.  And those are the guys.  Who's Todd and Tyler?  They're really, they've been there forever.  I'm not trashing them.  No, no.  They've been there forever.  A radio show down there?  A radio show.  That's been good to you?  It's the same way with you guys.  It's like I come in, it's like I'm talking to you.  You're hanging.  We're hanging out.  We're not going, what do you want to talk about today? 
[02:25:30]  That's going to be the way you got any big clangers.  What's pissing you off?  You know, as opposed to coming in.  What's got your goat, Lewis?  As opposed to coming in and sitting with, you know, friends who are going, okay, you're  fucked.  Yeah, that's right.  And having somebody poke you.  Poking at each other.  So, so that was it.  And I told them that.  And I was very serious.  We had this big meeting about press.  And the, so the thing comes back, neither of you were on the, the first time it came  by.  I said, Jesus fucking Christ. 
[02:26:00]  Was that the publicist?  Yeah.  You know, the publicist at the book company.  I mean, you know, you do.  We say it all the time.  It's never the talent.  It's always the publicist that forgets this.  And then, of course, we're so rational that we're like, fuck him.  That's right.  Fuck Lewis Black if he ain't doing our show.  That's right.  And it turns out Lewis was never, you know.  Well, then we go.  But we got out of here.  And then I, basically, I called Todd and Tyler on my own.  Do they tell you why they didn't put the show on the, what was it?  No, they never.  They always kind of go, you know, oh, you know. 
[02:26:30]  They stopped the, you know, I have a, you know, I'm paying somebody who deals with this  shit.  Yeah.  And he, they just ignored everything.  We're trying to steer clear of degenerate asshole shows.  Like Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  But we bring in the numbers, Lewis, right?  Or the highbrow shows.  Well, it's like, you know, there's, you know, there's certain shows.  That, that basically helped me get public.  It's like silly.  That's how the fuck I'm known, you fucking morons.  And then they had me on, you know, Geppetto's Workshop in Seattle. 
[02:27:00]  You know, Geppetto's.  Wait, really?  You're a crap show?  Yes.  Fuck is it.  Potholders.  Next, Lewis Black.  We're going to make a tongue depressor house when we come back.  Are you still on the Daily Show?  Are you still doing that?  Yeah.  How many years have you been there?  Wow, damn.  13.  Wow.  Jesus.  Yeah.  They're giving me a bar mitzvah.  15 years.  13.  That's a good idea.  You're one of the few that are actually left from the old regime.  I'm the only one.  How long has John been there?  John's been there a while now. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, John's been there about 10.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, because we interviewed him at N.A.W.  when he was first starting out.  Yeah.  With that project, obviously.  And you do it once a week?  No.  Now it's once every three weeks.  Okay.  Yeah.  What's that?  Busy.  You did stand-up in Europe, you said?  Yeah.  What do they get into as far as comedy goes?  Because I always hear it's different.  Like, some of the stuff you guys do in America doesn't, it just doesn't fly over there.  Well, it was weird because I had no, I mean, I was in Sweden.  The reason I said they know you is because they know Jim there. 
[02:28:00]  It's because they have this comedy scene that's been around now for eight, nine years, and they  kind of know, I asked who do you know, and they would mention your name.  I mean, they're comics.  Wow.  They're bringing over guys, and they got everything.  You know, you basically, you kind of, you know, you do what a comic does.  You're like, you know, if you're in Tulsa, you try to relate it to somebody from Tulsa.  It's fucking scary.  What do you go out and do press there and try to drum up, uh...  No, they, what they do is they fucking go online and send their, you know, an email 
[02:28:30]  blast to the 10,000 people that have an interest in comedy, and then they show up.  Wow.  And then tomorrow night, Yakov Smirnoff will be, uh, like, oh.  The big one was, the big one for me was, um, uh, which was amazing, was, uh, uh, Amsterdam,  because I've been going there for, like, performing there for, like, 10 of the last 15 years.  There's fucking 1,600, 1,800 people showed up.  Yeah.  Because I was going, I don't think we're going to really be able to sell these tickets. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, really?  Smelling like legal pot and vagina.  Yeah.  You smoked a pot over there at Lewis?  Not this time.  I have.  You have.  It's really something.  Yeah.  My friend Bowman, the one who, John Bowman, who opens, my opening act, was, he was,  there's something that he called bubble, there's something they got called bubble gum that really  is, the unbelievable.  Did you red light district at all?  It's, it's dying.  Why?  They're cleaning up everything.  Yeah.  I read an article where they're so pissed off because everyone's peeing on all the, uh, 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  the important buildings and stuff, and the old churches.  It's, it's kind of gotten, uh, yeah.  So they finally had it, and they're like, no, we got to clean this shit up.  They're moving it, uh, they're moving it out a bit, a bit, you know, they're kind of,  Uh, getting it out of the air.  And, you know, the art, and art galleries are moving in.  You can still get it, though, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Just go and jerk off in the art gallery.  That's what I would do.  Fuck, it used to be a horror house here.  Looking at a Norman Rockwell, the runaway.  A little kid in the doctor's office. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  How great is it looking at the women, you know, in the windows and stuff?  Just amazing?  No, because it depends on what time you're there.  Why?  There's certain times that it'd be like looking at a bad deli.  It's just bad meat hanging in the window.  So they got the day stripper thing happening like they have in America?  Yeah, no, it's really unbelievable.  Really?  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, you can't.  The hot ones are at what?  What's prime time?  Prime time for them is more toward the evening and the late show.  Same thing here, then, with the strippers, like you said. 
[02:30:30]  If you're by a strip club by a train track in the daytime, in the afternoon,  when you leave a strip club going, holy shit, it's light out.  Yeah, really.  You just saw a bad stripper.  Yeah, the worst.  It's Sunday night in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with David Tell, myself, and Sean Rouse.  Sean's a funny guy.  Sean is very good.  Jesus Christ.  And Sean had just hooked up with the two of us on this tour, and we went to this. 
[02:31:00]  It was all that was open.  It was a bar.  It was the only bar open downtown.  What a drunk he is, Rouse.  Holy shit, is he a fucking...  Oh, boy, what a drunker guy.  What does he have again?  He's got rheumatronic arthritis.  And the worst thing you could do is drink.  And he goes, fuck that, I need a drink.  Remember the time in Dallas when he showed up to breakfast, Jimmy?  You could barely move.  He was in such pain from the drinking night before.  He's a drunken son.  And all he has to do is not drink, and he would be way better physically. 
[02:31:30]  But he said, fuck that.  Yeah, no, it's amazing.  But we're sitting in this strip club, and there's like three strippers.  And they're all...  You know, there's one who's kind of cute, you know, after three drinks, and the other two.  And Sean goes, I'm going to go over there.  And he stumbles over to the...  There's a woman dancing over.  And there's nobody in there.  There's like seven of us.  And he stumbles over and sits there.  But two minutes later, he comes back.  He goes, you know, I don't think you should really be stripping with a Band-Aid and a running sore. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, shit.  A running sore.  He did a gig with me in Atlantic City, and he was...  We went up to the fucking...  The club gave us like a little VIP room after, and he was trying to bite people.  He was so drunk, he was trying to bite people.  A maniac.  Oh, he's an animal.  Yeah.  With all his lumps.  Oh, he's a drunkard.  Oh, boy.  Funny fuck, man.  He's real funny.  I'm going to have to go, guys.  Yeah, no, they're saying... 
[02:32:30]  He has to go to the next interview.  But I'm doing...  I'm getting out of here to...  I'm in Los Angeles Monday, which is at Largo.  What are you doing?  A book signing there.  Hey, cool.  In Glendale, Barnes & Noble.  I'll send them your best.  Working on any more movies or anything?  No, Mike, that career was...  Yes.  That was a quick career one.  I told you.  I told everybody.  Three movies done.  That's it.  You get your three movies.  At least I got them.  I know you have to leave, but I have to point out that commercial of you chasing the fucking crab with the net.  I've seen it probably... 
[02:33:00]  I mean, that was heavy rotation.  I laughed just as hard as the first time I saw that.  What do you go?  Oh, look, a crab.  And it just awkwardly run down the fucking beach with that net.  Dude, those were fun.  What island was that?  Aruba.  Aruba, nice.  They flew there for a commercial?  What commercial?  I don't even know what the commercial's for.  For Aruba.  To Aruba Travel.  It was for...  All right.  I wasn't sure if it was for Aruba.  16...  A crab.  We did 16 ads in four days.  But we did them.  It was great, because I was working with this Brit who was very funny. 
[02:33:30]  And we'd just go, bam, bam.  What about this?  We'll try that.  What about this?  Do this.  Da-da-da-da-da.  And it was all...  Kind of right on the spot.  Oh, yeah.  Come up with shit.  Yeah.  You nailed the excitement of finding a crab on a beach.  That was funny.  That was funny.  The excitement of finding a crab.  When you go on vacation, you can be the most important person back home.  But when you're on a beach, you see the dumbest things and get excited over it.  Like, what the fuck is wrong with me?  You nailed it, Lewis.  Nailed it.  Thanks, guys.  Lewis, thanks for popping in. 
[02:34:00]  Always a pleasure.  The book again, Lewis Black.  Me of little faith.  Now in paperback.  I read the book.  It's great.  Thanks.  A lot of great stuff in there.  Take care, guys.  Good luck with Michael.  Good seeing you.  Congratulations, buddy.  Thanks, man.  Yeah.  All right, Lewis.  Get out of here.  Jesus.  He's going down the hall.  What are you doing?  Sonny.  I think he's on Sonny's show.  Yeah.  Oh, you got to do that?  Sonny Fox.  Yeah, the movie's tough business.  Yeah, movies.  Yeah, the movie.  All right.  We'll go to break.  I'll be out Monday because I'm shooting, but I'll be back.  What?  What's happening?  Really?  What? 
[02:34:30]  You're shooting a movie, Jimmy?  Who isn't?  Who's movie?  Me.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Are you allowed to say?  Sure.  Maybe when I come back, I'll tell you the people I have a scene with.  Is it local?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Or L.A.  Local?  You don't have a scene with.  I'm not saying I do or don't.  Wait, you'll explain next.  Let's tease this.  I'm trying to think here.  Let's tease this.  It's obvious.  I won't know until I do it, actually.  All right, let's tease this.  Jimmy's got a little announcement after the break.  Let me just put it this way. 
[02:35:00]  Do you look like his retarded little brother?  Maybe.  The white one, yes.  Ah, yes.  See, that's what I meant.  All right.  Now I know exactly.  Give us the details next, though.  God damn you.  But first, the FU line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have eight new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, I want to give a big fuck you to alcoholism.  Now I can't drink anymore and make an ass of myself and puke all over the floor. 
[02:35:30]  Fuck you, alcoholism.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to say I take FU to the guidos at my gym who do nothing but Jager bombs, pound  some protein, and then grunt when they lift and leave their weights everywhere.  You fucking guido cunt pieces of shit.  Italy sucks.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big fuck you to genetics.  Just because I'm completely Irish, I got to be an alcoholic.  Fucking genetics and hereditaryism. 
[02:36:00]  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Nicole.  I'd like to say at you to my soon-to-be ex-boyfriend in the other room, learn how to fuck so that  way I could come.  If that's not the case, then guess what?  Fuck you.  You're out.  Next message.  Yeah, his FU's going out to my boss.  You fucking prick.  You cut my hours.  No money in the company.  Anything.  But then you hire an intern and pay him?  A fucking intern? 
[02:36:30]  You're paying an intern?  Fuck you.  Next message.  See, I'd like to give a big FU to my scheming, lying, conniving, fucking, soon-to-be ex-motherfucking  wife who felt the need to fucking cheat on me because I work too much, I watch the news  too much, and because I don't want to sit in a fucking parking lot sucking her dad's  cocktail game at the goddamn football game.  How the fuck am I supposed to relax?  What the fuck?  Next message.  Hey, this is Joe from Jersey.  I want to give a big FU to my wife for not wiping her ass properly before I fuck her

Yeah, I'd like to give a big fuck you to you.  Whoever the fuck is listening out there, fuck you.  I hate you all.  You can all suck my fucking balls.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line, 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[02:37:30]  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you, and goodbye.  Opie and Anthony morning, 6 to 11 a.m. live and uncensored.  Just about every human being would be offended by what you said today, the virus.  I love you just the way you are.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  I love you any way you are. 
[02:38:00]  Yes, I do.  Come close to me.  I see song promo.  Be a part of me, and I'll love you anyway.  Yes, I will any day.  I will love you.  He's singing about a subway drink.  Yes, I will. 
[02:38:30]  I will.  I will love you.  This is from Tippy Tom.  And yes, I'll do.  I'll hold you close.  No, you won't.  And you can kiss me if you want.  The microphone's melting.  And yes, I love your kiss.  And I will kiss you, too. 
[02:39:00]  That's great.  That's it.  That's it?  All right.  He just threw the mic down.  Now, you best pay attention.  Sirius 197 XM 202.  No virus.  Please do not turn off your radio, but turn up the volume on your receiver as high as it  can go so that you can make the sound we broadcast as loud as possible.  No.  The unpleasant noise you are about to hear coming from your radio is not a mistake.  Yeah, okay.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:39:30]  That's right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Hearing a lot of Tippy Tom bits today because he died.  Yes, if you're just tuning in, Tippy Tom has died.  Yeah.  We're getting details together as far as a tribute show.  It will be a great listen when we get it all together.  I think we're doing it next weekend for like three days.  That's how much material Tippy Tom gave us over the years.  Good material.  Absolutely.  Every time he was on, it was good. 
[02:40:00]  I don't think there's one clip that you could pull that isn't a good clip from Tippy.  Never a bad appearance.  And we learned that he died May 6th.  He's still in the morgue.  We're trying to get his body out of there.  And we're going to do some kind of memorial.  And I would assume it's going to be a huge event.  So just keep listening for all the details of that.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes,  We've been Googling the hell out of Tippy Tom died.  Not a blip on the trends.  The Jackson thing is just too damn big.  Yeah, that's a hard nut to crack.  We're trying to get him in the Google trends today. 
[02:40:30]  Just Google, Tippy Tom died.  The Google.  The Google.  The fucking Facebook is shit.  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened?  Everything in my inbox is these mass email invites.  And it's like, it's really, I want to block these.  If you send me a mass invite, I just want to block you.  I don't want to get fucking mail from you.  You know what happens?  Holy shit.  All these social networking sites, they start out, they start getting people, and you get  a lot of friends, and then people realize, oh, I'm going to use this guy to push my shit. 
[02:41:00]  And then they spam you, and it turns into a big spam site.  And then no one goes there again.  Twitter is going to be the same thing with Twitter.  You watch.  They're going to start tweeting.  I see it creeping in.  The thing is, you can block people.  Yeah, I know.  Like, you can only follow who you want to follow.  So if somebody's fucking with you, you just stop following.  It's creeping in here and there.  How do you, I want to know how to block people.  Like this guy who's sending me these fucking links, I want to just block them.  Yeah, you got to, if you log in, like, on a computer, Facebook, not iPhone, Facebook, 
[02:41:30]  and there's all sorts of settings.  You have privacy settings and security settings.  I know, but I only want to block certain people.  I don't want you to have to be my friend to email me.  But if you send me, like, one of those forwards or one of those evites, goodbye.  You're blocked.  A forward.  Fuck you.  They're not funny.  No one laughs at the forwards.  No.  It's 20 people on the fucking header, and it's just talking about, hey, here's a funny  thing I heard, or touching story of a soldier and a boy in an airport. 
[02:42:00]  Shut up.  Do you ever get these fucking, uh.  Yes, I do.  These stupid, uh, whether you're listening to other people, you're reading other people's  conversations.  Yeah, who cares?  What the fuck?  Facebook stinks.  That's why Twitter's slowly but surely, uh, putting them out of business.  Hey, Jimmy, fuck all that.  What movie are you doing?  Um, it looks like a little scene from a couple of dicks.  I know it.  Kevin Smith's new movie.  Yes.  Nice.  And, uh, would this scene be you and the stars of the motion picture? 
[02:42:30]  Possibly.  Honestly, I don't know 100% what their names are.  I just will say I know I have a scene with a couple of officers.  Dude, you're doing a scene with Bruce Willis?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know what his character's name is.  I didn't ask.  John McClane.  No, that wouldn't be it.  No, I don't know.  It honestly might not be him.  I just don't know.  For real, you don't know?  I know.  I'm dead serious.  I don't know.  Are you playing Bill Clay?  Are you going to freak if you have to do lines with Bruce Willis? 
[02:43:00]  No, it'll be fine.  I know.  The lines, there's only a few lines.  Does anybody, again, if you can look up, what are Bruce's and Tracy's character names  in the movie?  I think they're the cops in the movie, so.  No, there's a few cops, though, and it's just, you're doing a scene with Bruce Willis?  I honestly don't know.  I'm not saying yes or no, because I really, there's other guys in it, too.  Tracy Morgan.  There's no character name?  No, there's no character name on the IMDb list.  Is there any way to Google it?  There might be some kind of William Scott.  Google.  Yeah, exactly.  Show him Scott's it. 
[02:43:30]  It might be with him.  I just don't know.  Well, this is big news for you, Jimmy.  You're going to be in the new Kevin Smith movie.  As long as you do well.  I have a few lines, yeah.  And you don't end up in the cutting room floor.  I hope not.  Nah, you'll do fine.  That's awesome.  A couple of dicks.  But you just got back.  Now you're going away again.  Oh, one day.  Oh, all right.  It's in New York.  Yeah, it's got to be the Bruce and Tracy.  Has to be.  Why does Kevin name the movies, these things, though?  Kevin doesn't.  He didn't write that.  He doesn't.  He's just a director.  My friend Rob wrote this movie.  This is someone else's project. 
[02:44:00]  He's directing.  I shouldn't say just a director.  That's kind of a slap.  I mean, no, he's talked about the last title debacle.  No, he's talked about this on the show.  He loves the fact that he's directing, and he doesn't have to really worry about it because  it's someone else's vision.  So he actually has time to make camera moves?  Yeah, he didn't name the movie.  He didn't write the movie.  But he's going to direct this thing and do a great job doing it.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Scott in New York. 
[02:44:30]  Scott.  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah, what's going on?  What's up?  Hello?  Yes, sir.  We're on the air.  Let's go.  I just came off with a set of a couple of dicks with Kevin Smith over there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, they were doing a scene with a bunch of cop cars.  Was Bruce and Tracy in it?  No, not this morning.  They're what they call the heroes.  They got no heroes on there this morning.  No heroes. 
[02:45:00]  As they say.  Okay.  I love movie lingo.  The heroes.  Jesus.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  You got a trailer?  Later.  I'll probably get.  Can I have a little trailer there, Jimmy?  Probably the same kind I got in Zack and Mirrors.  It's like a little sitting area in a trailer.  It's very small, but it's air-conditioned, a little in your own bathroom.  Can you just sit around?  Yeah.  Get a blowjob in there?  You can.  I mean, it's a real case of hurry up and wait, guys.  When should I come by?  Oh, I got to go for my fitting today for my clothes. 
[02:45:30]  Are you going to be a police officer?  Yeah.  What are you playing?  Are you allowed to say?  I probably can, but I won't until I shoot it.  Why?  Because I want to see how it looks.  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you, too.  All right.  What are you doing?  Is it a unique wardrobe, or is it your face?  No.  No, no, no.  The wardrobe is not crazy at all.  All right.  What are you doing?  I see the smile.  Not wearing a rubber cell phone suit.  No.  I'm wearing a rubber cell phone.  Is it a stretch for you, what you're playing or doing? 
[02:46:00]  It's not that different than just me.  I mean, I don't know.  I have to see how they're going to be made up.  I like how Jimmy doesn't want to jinx anything.  Well, I honestly don't know.  I mean, I don't want to say.  I just don't know.  I know the lines.  You want to practice them?  No.  Do you got one of them?  What the hell kind of cops are you?  Oh, very good.  I like that.  Did you practice all the way?  What the hell kind of cops are you?  What the hell kind of cops are you? 
[02:46:30]  Did you practice all the way home from L.A.?  No.  I actually, because I now remember.  What kind of cops are you, David?  Is it true that you didn't have me tonight?  No, you, you did.  The whole fucking ride home.  No, I was concentrating on, actually, with Red Eye, I got preempted last night.  No, I was doing something else.  I was thinking about that.  And then yesterday, it was just going to be dedicated to Red Eye.  And then today, tomorrow, Sunday, just to kind of.  Is it true?  One of your lines is, continued success.  Yes, at the end.  And then I say, hey, can we have these lifts? 
[02:47:00]  I'd like to change the light bulb.  Continued success.  Good one.  Why don't you give them a watch and a fucking, a card.  Horrible death line.  Take it, sleazy.  Dave in Florida.  Talking to Jimmy Norton here, who's now going to be a big movie star again.  Hi, Dave.  What's up, Dave?  A movie.  I'm making my big star.  Tippi Tom, first and foremost.  Jimmy, I saw you over the weekend at, over last weekend, I guess, at the Improv in Fort Lauderdale.  Oh, cool. 
[02:47:30]  First of all, you killed.  Thank you.  It's rare when you play down here.  You're always up in West Palm Beach.  You should play down here more often.  Yeah, I like Fort Lauderdale.  But I went in a car and asked something.  Something stuck out out of your act that I just don't understand.  True.  You do a bit about how you won't fuck a girl when she's on her period.  Yet you'll have hookers shit and piss on you, which I don't understand.  I know, sir, but that is the beauty of me.  Not always consistent.  Will you fuck a girl in the ass? 
[02:48:00]  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  What do you think?  You're not.  What do you think?  He's a communist?  Yeah.  Of course.  After all, we are not communists.  Exactly.  Of course.  Of course he will.  Fucking is like the easy part, too.  Who'll need it for breakfast?  I don't give a shit.  He'll get right in there.  Get your tongue in there.  Nice.  Jimmy, you missed the Rich Voss appearance yesterday.  He said progerios.  Oh, my God.  What do you got? 
[02:48:30]  The progerios disease?  And he pronounces Newark?  Nork.  Nork.  He was like, yeah, I was in Nork.  It's like Nork.  You missed it, man.  What a fucking Nork.  And then what else?  Is it Benedict Arnold?  Yeah, that's an oldie but goodie.  Yeah.  The new ones, though, are progerios.  As in progerios for breakfast.  That whole list, all those pages on that door are all of his fuck-ups that he said.  It's five pages that is just very small type, single-spaced, and it's all of his fuck-ups. 
[02:49:00]  He is adult.  I love Rich, though.  He's very funny, especially on stage.  People go and see the show and go, oh, my God, this guy's hysterical.  He's great.  But he's such an idiot on your show.  Yes, we know.  Travis, you got the first Tippy Tom appearance.  Yeah, the first one ever, right?  Well, I have it.  The thing is that I have it.  It's the worst of bits, so it's 19 minutes. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  So, like...  Iraq was telling me about the first time he did our XM show, and we thought he was dead.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I have that.  I would like to actually hear when he's first brought in.  That's three minutes?  Yeah.  All right, that's three...  Yeah, let's listen to that real fast.  Even if you have to cut it off, though, at a certain point, I would like to hear when  he's first brought into the studio, when we first, first, first meet.  Oh, yeah, well...  Just listen to the beginning of it.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, what...  Do you want the thinking you're dead?  I don't have a timer now, because we have someone on the phone, so the other one would work better  right now, and then we can play the one Ant's talking about, 
[02:50:00]  because we've got Judith Regan who wants to talk about Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett  on the line.  All right, go ahead there, Travis.  Make sure the mic works.  Wait, and...  Hot it up.  Make sure the mic works.  Wait, and...  Hot it up.  Test the mic.  Test the mic.  Oh, my God.  And how are they going to hear us?  Test the mic.  Why would they do that?  They're waking him up.  They're waking him up.  Tippy Tom.  It's Tommy.  Uh-oh, he might be dead.  Tommy.  That was not dead.  He could be.  Is he blue?  Tommy.  He looks a little blue.  He's not moving. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, my God.  Is he blue?  He's taking his pulse.  Is he dead?  Oh, my God.  No, I'm serious.  Oh, my...  We could have a problem.  Uh-oh.  Tippy Tom.  Oh, my God.  Smack him in the head.  All right.  His ears are...  No, no, no, no.  Don't smack him.  His ears are kind of red.  No, he's...  I think he's alive.  They can't wake him, though.  Wow, he... 
[02:51:00]  This is a...  Does he have a pulse?  Oh, my God.  He's not waking up.  No, don't hit him.  Don't hit him.  Don't smack him in the fire.  You'd like to try, Master Poe?  He's dead.  He's taking his pulse.  Does he have a pulse?  Yeah, does he have a pulse?  Oh, I hope he didn't kill the homeless guy.  He's the only one we have.  Does he have a pulse?  I think it's a very, very faint pulse.  Oh, my God. 
[02:51:30]  Is he waking?  How great would it be if he died on the radio show?  It wouldn't be great.  Oh, God.  What is he doing?  Dude, he's not moving at all.  All right.  Holy S.  How are we going to get him out of here?  Just leave him here.  Let them deal with him later.  Put him in the Frank's place, studio.  Oh, there he goes.  Okay.  That kind of...  Did that get him a little bit?  Did that get...  That's how you...  Oh, he's stirring.  He's stirring.  Give me time. 
[02:52:00]  What is Poe doing?  Yeah, we got some fun.  He's alive!  He's alive!  Thank God!  Oh, my God.  Knock you out.  You ready to do a little more singing?  Gotta wake up, Timmy.  You ready?  Oh, my...  I thought he was dead.  Dude, I'm not kidding you.  I thought he was dead, Tim.  Just a little water in the air.  Dude, did you all of a sudden have it going through your head, the news and everything?  Yes, of course.  All of a sudden, it was all going through my head.  Like, oh, my God.  The news.  We're fired.  Wow.  Wake up! 
[02:52:30]  All right, he's starting to wake up.  You have to wake up.  Water on the eardrop.  All right, where are you at now?  No, you know why?  Some people want to hear you.  Water on the eardrop?  I'm not saying.  Frank's and after together.  I need my 15-minute rest.  You were resting.  15 minutes?  It's my business.  Not yours.  No, no, I know, Tippi, but we need you inside.  I don't bother you when you're resting.  It doesn't bother me.  Oh, my God.  Thank God he's alive.  Thank.  I can't believe we have to say this on our radio show.  Get the fuck out there and work and come back. 
[02:53:00]  Back me up in 20 minutes.  Yeah, Tippi Tom, drink this.  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  And there you go.  The day we thought Tippi Tom was dead in studio.  And now he is.  And now five years later, more or less, he is dead.  And we're going to have a tribute show and a memorial.  And we're all in with this Tippi Tom thing.  I hope you join us.  We've got Judith Regan on the phone.  Judith.  Hey there.  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:53:30]  I don't think we've ever talked to you before.  No, I don't think you have.  It's a pleasure.  Which is all mine.  Nah, come on.  Come on.  That's true.  Michael Jackson, Farrah Fawcett.  I know.  It's very tragic.  You know, I knew Farrah.  We used to hang out together.  And I worked with Michael a bit because he wanted to do a second book at some point.  And we had many conversations.  And I did something at Carnegie Hall with him.  And would fly out to L.A. from time to time and meet with him. 
[02:54:00]  And met one of his children who was often with him.  And I have to say there are actually parallels between their lives in my mind.  Because in Michael Jackson's case, this guy was so bizarre in every way in terms of his personal life.  He was a true genius.  I think he was one of the most driven people I've ever met. 
[02:54:30]  And driven more or less by a need to be loved and understood.  And his life really represented what each of us have, which is the need to be loved and understood.  And he sang a song, I Am Not Alone.  But ultimately, he was alone.  And he lived a life of real horrifying loneliness.  Because he had such an incredibly difficult time finding any kind of love in his life.  And if you look at all the things that he did in his life in pursuit of that, including his own perfectionism on the stage, 
[02:55:00]  he never really did achieve that love.  And I'd say, in some respects, Farrah Fawcett had the same journey.  Because, you know, she had a number of twisted relationships with men, including Ryan O'Neill,  who I regarded his latest, you know, crocodile tears as nothing more than opportunism and quite disgusting.  Wasn't he abusive towards her?  Yeah, a lot of men were abusive towards her. 
[02:55:30]  And she was childlike in some of the ways that Michael Jackson was.  Yeah, I've got to stop you for a second with the Ryan O'Neill thing.  How pissed off is he that he's not all over CNN, Fox News, and all the other news channels today?  You know, because he looked at this as an opportunity to get his face on TV.  I know.  I think the way he's behaved throughout his relationship with her is reprehensible.  And I don't know if you saw, there was an interview with him.  He talked about, he refers to his own son as her son. 
[02:56:00]  Right.  He's a horrible, horrible man.  He destroyed the lives of his children.  In some ways, I think, contributed to her death.  Was not a loving person at all.  And she, too, if you knew her, had a very childlike manner.  And both Michael and Farrah, and Michael, I think, in a more extreme way, kind of retreated into a childlike state.  Their voices got higher.  You know, they were in a defensive posture.  They're in a defensive posture because, especially with Michael Jackson, the assault upon him. 
[02:56:30]  You know, these people become sort of celebrity dartboards for the culture where people just love to take shots at them.  And, you know, very often it results in their behavior, you know, being aberrant in one way or another because they're so disturbed.  Well, you know, some of the allegations against them were pretty despicable.  And then it was questionable as how, too, they were disposed of.  So I think that followed him, and that could have been a big reason why people kind of did have this resentment towards him. 
[02:57:00]  Well, there's no doubt about that.  There's no doubt about that.  And I don't think, you know, the truth has ever come out about that.  We don't really know what happened.  But I do think that he was an opportunity for a lot of people in business and his personal life.  And there's no doubt that when you achieve that kind of fame, any kind of fame, you become an opportunity for people.  And when I was in the presence of Michael Jackson, my feeling was this is a severely disturbed, emotionally disturbed person who needs a tremendous amount of help. 
[02:57:30]  How was he to you?  Was he pompous or was he arrogant or was he pleasant?  No, he wasn't arrogant at all.  He was disconnected.  He was in a dissociative state.  He wasn't, you know, it's like he was in an altered state all the time because he was so, I mean, the kid was abused as a child, terribly abused.  And, you know, we've all read the accounts of his father and what they did to make him perform as he did and to achieve the excellence that he achieved. 
[02:58:00]  You know, his life from a very early age, he was driven to a perfectionism by his father that most people could never have achieved because he had enormous talent.  But when you think about it, he grew up without a childhood.  He was working from the time he was two years old.  He never interacted in a normal way with other children.  And at the end of the day, human beings have a need to be loved and understood.  And he was driven like a slave.  So he never had the opportunity to grow and develop as a normal person. 
[02:58:30]  And although we all thought he was cute and adorable and it was beautiful, there was a price that he paid.  Do you think that the plastic surgery and stuff, because you mentioned his father and Joe and it was abusive and stuff, that plastic surgery went so far beyond just fixing yourself.  It was almost like some kind of an angry racial denial.  I mean, to have your nose thin, the cleft, all these weird things that you associate with a white face, do you think that had anything to do with his father or hating the way he was raised?  Well, I'm sure that all of these things contributed, there's no doubt, because, you know, he was a man in search of love and recognition and fulfillment, which is why he wanted to be such a perfectionist on the stage, 
[02:59:00]  because that was the only place in his life where he could have any kind of connection, where he felt loved and adored, because he never felt it at home.  He didn't have any kind of healthy, kind of loving, nurturing relationship that didn't require him to perform at a high level.  He was never loved for himself.  And his mental illness, he had body dysmorphia. 
[02:59:30]  You know, did it come from his father?  Did it come from the circumstances of his life?  I'm sure all of this contributed.  But he never was comfortable with his own body.  He was constantly trying to change it.  You know, maybe then they'll love me.  Maybe then they'll love me.  Maybe then they'll love me.  You know, people have that sort of thing.  He was mentally ill.  The man was mentally ill.  He never had people around him who really helped him when he needed it.  And then when he got famous, and what happens when you get famous and you have that kind of wealth and recognition, 
[03:00:00]  you're surrounded by people who are yes men, who are constantly flattering you, who are stealing from you, who are taking from you.  They're not loving you.  I felt the same thing in my meeting with Britney Spears when I went to meet her when she wanted to do a book.  I went to her house, and she was pregnant with her second child.  She was near giving birth.  And she, too, was in the same kind of dissociative state and kind of an altered state.  They're so traumatized by the circumstances of their lives by not having anyone around them who will support them and take care of them in a normal way, 
[03:00:30]  because every single person in their life is using them.  Well, people would think it would be a great life.  That's what's so strange about what you're saying.  It's not a great life.  It's a horrifying life.  No, I understand it.  But just us dummies looking in, you're like, gosh, they have to have the greatest life ever.  Right, because the truth is it's a life of terrifying isolation.  You know, when he sings, you are not alone, I am here with you, he was alone.  Farrah Fawcett was alone, I can tell you. 
[03:01:00]  You know, she had friends, but it was difficult for both of them, and Michael Jackson in a much, much greater way,  because he was always alone in his own mind.  Well, you know what, people are afraid that they do fall into this thing where it's all yes people around them,  because people are so afraid of being banished from the inner circle by saying the wrong thing,  so they just refuse to criticize or tell a lot of times what they need to hear.  They're on the gravy train.  And they love being around famous people. 
[03:01:30]  They love the perks that come with it.  They love the sense of power that comes with it.  And, you know, Britney Spears, I was terribly worried about her when I had the meeting with her,  in the same way that I was concerned about Michael Jackson, that these people need help.  They needed help.  You know, Britney Spears, when she was at that moment when I met with her, she needed help.  You know, she was surrounded by agents and people who were making a tremendous living off of her  who would stand to make millions of dollars, you know,  if she did this deal or that deal.  And they don't want to stop and take her off the train, the gravy train, 
[03:02:00]  to get her the help that she needs.  And so all the people around them, the friends, the family, they start,  they live off of these celebrities.  They earn a living.  You know, they're tied to their work.  There's so many conflicts of interest.  And they live very, very, very lonely lives.  And I think that Michael Jackson is the epitome of that.  Judith, the book with you were going to do it, Michael, why didn't it happen?  Were there certain things that were, like, off limits?  Or they said, look, you can do it, but you can't do this, this, or this? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  No, the reason the book never happened was because he wanted to do a completely insane book.  I mean, you know, he was really out of touch with reality.  Wow.  He wanted to do a book about loving children.  Jesus.  Okay?  And he really didn't understand what was appropriate and what was inappropriate  because he had the emotional maturity of about an 8-year-old.  Wow.  You know, or maybe an early adolescent.  You know, and I had worked with somebody else who had done a lot of private eye work for him. 
[03:03:00]  And, of course, he had an alarm that was, you know, 30 feet or 30 yards or something from his bedroom.  I can't remember.  And he liked getting into bed with the kids because it gave him comfort.  You know, and this is mental illness.  Any adult who's healthy knows it's inappropriate to do that.  And whatever else happened after that, you know, nobody will ever know.  Well, what's your opinion on that?  What do you think?  You think he was...  You know, I think that it's likely, given the profile of child molesters, 
[03:03:30]  and there are many different kinds of people who molest children,  I think he fit the profile in a lot of ways.  Sure.  Because he, you know, a lot of them say they love the children, they love the children,  because they're so emotionally immature themselves that they can only relate to children.  You know, it's a mental illness, you know, that they can only feel safe around other children.  And whether or not, you know, he's extended into the erotic, I don't think that's ever been proven. 
[03:04:00]  But it would not be inconceivable.  You know, I think that it's an extension of a lot of his problems.  And, you know, if he had had attention at an early age, you know, maybe some of this could have been nipped in the bud.  But when he, you look at him as a child, he was healthy, he was beautiful, he was vital, he was full of life, he was, he seemed happy.  We don't really know what was going on behind the scenes at home and what kind of a life he had.  We know he never had any normal friends. 
[03:04:30]  And we know that this is not healthy.  Right.  Okay.  The way he lived his life as a child is not healthy.  And although children can endure all kinds of things because they're tremendously resilient,  at some point in their lives it catches up to them.  And it certainly caught up with him.  And look at what he did to himself.  I think that the plastic surgeons who worked with him, the dermatologist who did these things to him,  committed crimes against him because he was a mentally ill person.  They took his money to do these things to him that they never should have done. 
[03:05:00]  He should have had psychiatric help at an earlier age.  He should have had the love and nurturing that every human being should have.  But, you know, the man was one of the most gifted musicians in the history of the world.  I don't think there's any.  He was one of the most gifted performers, and he was extraordinary.  I don't think there's any denying that.  It's just kind of weird because it's very hard to sympathize with somebody regardless of the upbringing and everything  because it just seems like all that is kind of an excuse for horrid behavior of a man who should know right from wrong enough 
[03:05:30]  to the point where you don't do that.  No, I think there's no doubt about that he was an adult.  But I think that we really have to examine, you know, how does this happen?  How does someone become so disturbed that they destroy their lives in that way?  And I think in his case, you know, it was an exaggerated situation.  There are many, many people like Michael Jackson who don't have the money to do the things that he did to his body 
[03:06:00]  and don't have the access and opportunity to do the kinds of destructive things he did in his life,  you know, both personally and professionally.  But I still think that it's worth examining, you know, why does this happen?  And it's really an old story, and it's a story of man's inhumanity to man about our lack of understanding,  about our lack of love and nurturing, and how human beings ultimately really need to be loved and nurtured.  And if nothing else, I really regard what happened to him, no matter what the autopsy shows, 
[03:06:30]  as ultimately it's a suicide.  Well, yeah.  Because he was on the path.  Sorry, I wanted to interrupt you there, speaking of the suicide,  because, you know, it started a swirl that drugs were involved.  Well, it came out that he had a pretty massive shot of morphine the night before.  Demerol, actually.  Same thing.  What are you hearing as far as the drugs and the people around him?  Well, you know what?  I don't think anyone really knows yet until the toxicology report is done. 
[03:07:00]  What's your gut feeling, though, is what I'm saying?  Oh, listen, he was doing drugs for years.  He was medicated for years, and the man was in tremendous pain.  Physically, he was in tremendous pain.  Emotionally, he was in tremendous pain.  Spiritually, he was in tremendous pain.  He lived a life of horrifying pain.  He was horribly lonely.  He had destroyed himself in so many ways, physically, emotionally, and now, in the end, physically.  You know, he was just a wreck.  So, you know, it doesn't surprise me. 
[03:07:30]  It wouldn't surprise me if there were any number of drugs that resulted in his death or, you know, contributed to his death.  But, again, it goes back to the same thing, which is that this is a horribly, horribly tragic life, you know, a man with such amazing, amazing gifts and yet a horribly lonely, lonely, tortured life.  And that's the lesson that I think we need to take away from this.  It's that this is a man who really spent a life in search of love and approval and fulfillment, which he tried to achieve in his perfectionism, in his music, and in his life as a performer, where he was never happy. 
[03:08:00]  I mean, this is a guy, he was so driven to be great and to do incredible things on that stage.  And that drive to be that kind of great is a drive for recognition and fulfillment and ultimately love.  And it was a drive that never really resulted in the fulfillment of his wish, which was to be loved and understood. 
[03:08:30]  And, Judith, did you hear anything about how he was not hired?  He hadn't hired any background dancers or he hadn't hired choreographers.  I heard a rumor that he hadn't even hired people to start this tour.  Which started very shortly and then he was blowing off the rehearsals.  Was he really unprepared for this or do you not know?  I've heard varying things, that he was prepared, that he wasn't prepared, that he was rehearsing, that he had people rehearsing, that he was trying hard.  What I had heard was that he was trying to do the physicality of what he used to do.  And at 50 and with his body and the shape that it was in, he couldn't do it. 
[03:09:00]  And maybe he was pushing himself and medicating himself with painkillers to try to push himself through it.  I don't know.  And you said just about to switch, which is a big day for Farrah Fawcett and him.  You said Ryan O'Neill, you thought, cried crocodile tears.  Do you think that he just really didn't give a shit about her or why do you say that?  You know what?  I think he's despicable.  I think he contributed in large part to the sadness of her life.  I think that he contributed to her illness.  You know, I think that she, too, like Michael Jackson, you know, was in search of love and had a hard time finding it. 
[03:09:30]  She had a lot of tortured relationships with men.  I know that they were very, very, very hurtful to her.  She retreated a lot into childlike states.  She was a very bright and loving person.  You know, a very tender-hearted person in the way that Michael Jackson was a very tender-hearted person.  You know, they're incredibly sensitive, tender-hearted people who are injured by the things that happen in their lives, 
[03:10:00]  who want to be loved just like everyone else, and can't have healthy relationships, don't find love in their lives.  And it's very tragic.  I think Ryan O'Neal was horrible to her, horrible to his children.  Look at the path of destruction that that man has left all around him.  Why do you think he was so bad?  Was he physically abusive to her?  Yes.  Yeah, the stories are pretty...  Speak for themselves with that guy.  I mean, it's just awful what he did to her.  Yeah, I don't think...  I mean, look what he did to his children. 
[03:10:30]  Just read Tatum O'Neal's book, listen to any of the things his children have said,  and the only thing that he could ever do to redeem himself at this point is to make amends with his children,  to try to help his son Redman, to try to turn his life around and move it in a more positive direction.  He's a disgrace.  I don't mean to be combative or anything, but you have a lot of venom for Ryan O'Neal  and a lot of sympathy for Michael Jackson.  And if you ask me, Michael Jackson seems to have left a lot of destruction in his wake. 
[03:11:00]  No, it's true.  He did leave a lot of destruction in his wake.  Yeah.  I'm trying to understand what happened with Michael Jackson,  and I do think, unlike Ryan O'Neal,  Michael Jackson had a very difficult and tortured childhood  and was a very disturbed person at an early age,  and I think was in a psychotic state.  I don't even think...  I don't think he was half aware of the things that he was doing.  So you think with Ryan O'Neal it kind of comes from a place of meanness or self-interest,  whereas with Michael Jackson it comes from a place of being a guy who's honestly fucked up?  Yes, I do. 
[03:11:30]  And I'm not diminishing in any way anything that Michael Jackson might have done, not in any way.  I think that, you know, if he did these things, it's horrible, it's unforgivable.  Well, when you see huge paydays going out to parents and settlements that he spent time with these children  and then he's paying the parents all kinds of money,  you can really assume that these things went on with almost absolute certainty.  Obviously there's a little plausible deniability there. 
[03:12:00]  Let me tell you, I've been around a lot of celebrities who are constantly being sued.  They're viewed as opportunities by other people.  They're falsely accused all the time because they are viewed as opportunities.  And I don't think we really know what happened with Michael Jackson.  I mean, can you assume it?  Maybe you can.  I don't know.  I mean, do you know with absolute certainty?  No, I actually...  No, I also don't know if, you know, maybe Farrah was a little bit of a bitch and Ryan was just kind of...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, absolutely not. 
[03:12:30]  All righty.  That's outrageous.  And by the way, even if she is a bitch, no one should be beaten because they're a bitch.  Was she with him and then broke up and then they got back?  I mean, were they on and off or were they together all the time?  They had a tortured relationship off and on and off and on.  Yeah, and then she, you know, got sick and kept him around.  Yeah, and then he wanted to...  He kept him around.  Yeah, apparently he just...  I want to know more about that meeting with Michael Jackson.  Like, what are some of the things you observed?  What were the kids like?  What was the kid like that you met? 
[03:13:00]  I mean, he looked frightening, right?  Like, I heard he was down to 100, 110 pounds.  Yeah, I mean, he was skeletal even then, and this was a number of years ago.  But one of his children was there and it was very, very hot.  He was recording.  The last time I saw him, he was recording in a studio in Hollywood.  And I went to the studio.  I went into his private room and one of his children was there.  His son, the first one, I forgot his name.  Prince Michael?  Prince Michael.  And he was drawing pictures that were so disturbed, really disturbed. 
[03:13:30]  And I really felt for those children because they were not in a normal, healthy situation.  And what he was doing to them was just bizarre.  What kind of drawing was it?  You know, drawings of people being stabbed and just very weird things.  You know, he was having all kinds of disturbed fantasies.  And it was very sad, you know, that he was isolating his children in the same way that  he was isolated and doing all these bizarre things and covering them with all these clothes. 
[03:14:00]  And it was incredibly hot.  It was like 90 degrees in his studio in his private area.  He kept it overheated, which is also not normal, in the dark.  And these kids should have been on playgrounds playing with other children.  But he was creating the same environment, in essence, that he had.  You know, terrible isolation and, again, mentally ill.  And the conversation I had with him, he was so disconnected from reality, very similar to  the conversation I had with Britney Spears when I went to see her about doing her book. 
[03:14:30]  And maybe it was drugs.  You know, maybe they were both medicated.  I'm not somebody who can easily identify, you know, when people are on drugs because I've  never been a drug person.  And maybe they were both, you know, on various kinds of drugs and they just, you know, didn't  connect in a normal way.  But they were both at very, very similar disconnection and rambling.  How white was his skin?  I mean, what can it tell us about that skin? 
[03:15:00]  You know, he looks, it was weird, you know.  I mean, whatever medications he had taken to make his skin that way or whatever disease  he suffered from, it was bizarre.  Were you alone in the room with him and the kid or was there agents and people?  No, I was alone with him.  So did you, now when he was talking about wanting to do a children's book and you saw  it was just unrealistic and not what the book obviously you wanted to do.  It's just amazing.  Did you tell him that or did you say to him, did you try to kind of guide him back or what  did you say to him?  No, it wasn't a children's book.  He wanted to do a book about children.  Yeah, about how he loved children. 
[03:15:30]  And I, you know, I tried to talk to him about how it wasn't a good idea.  You know, I was always very honest with people.  And, you know, I'm not a mean-spirited person in terms of meeting with authors and stuff.  You know, I wouldn't ridicule them or humiliate them or anything like that.  It's just not what I do.  But I would talk to them in a very honest way.  You know, it's not a good idea.  It's not healthy.  It doesn't, you know, make any sense.  It's going to be misconstrued.  It's very bizarre.  And, you know, you should really write about your life and your struggles and the things 
[03:16:00]  that you've gone through and what they mean to you and all that sort of thing.  It does show you that he was disconnected, too, because with all the way people perceive  this weird stuff with kids.  Exactly.  He was so public still about hanging out with kids.  And it's like most pedophiles keep it under their hats.  But he was like, no, no, I want to build a fucking ranch with kids all over it.  It was just really weird.  Exactly, because he was not healthy.  He was in a psychotic.  He was not in his own mind.  He was out of his mind.  Right?  Why couldn't the family get involved? 
[03:16:30]  You know what?  Because the laws, and I don't know anything about the family in terms of whether they try  to.  I'm sure, you know, people have tried over the years.  But in most states, after the age of 18, there's really nothing you can do, tragically,  to help people.  Because either they do it themselves.  You know, in some states, you can have people committed for a period of a day or three days  for observation.  But it's very difficult to do.  And ultimately, they have to decide to do it themselves.  And if they're mentally ill, which I do believe, absolutely, positively, Michael Jackson was 
[03:17:00]  severely mentally ill.  It's very, very difficult when you're mentally ill to take care of yourself.  And the laws are such that you can't be forced to take care of yourself.  Judith, before we let you go, was there anybody that suggested a book that you didn't think  would work that actually did?  Or that you thought would be kind of shitty that actually turned out to be really good?  Oh, boy.  I'd have to think about that.  I mean, I've worked with so many people over the years. 
[03:17:30]  And, you know, usually, if I worked with them, we tried to steer it in the right direction.  Right.  You know, and I, you know, listen, Michael Jackson could have published anything, and  it probably would have sold.  But it just wasn't appropriate.  It wasn't right.  It wouldn't have been good for him.  The same thing with Britney Spears.  You know, I said to her agents at the time, she really needs help.  She doesn't need to be doing a book.  She needs help, you know, because she's obviously in a terrible state.  Do you think...  It was so clear to me that she was in such need of help. 
[03:18:00]  And you sit there, and all these people are sitting around pretending that everything's  normal.  Same thing with Michael Jackson, that everything's normal.  And these people are so ill, and they need help.  Well, they look the other way because they don't want to lose their payday, right?  Exactly.  And it's just wrong.  What about Britney?  You think she's in a better state these days?  I mean, I certainly haven't been...  You know, I had that meeting with her, and that was that.  But she seems to be in a better state.  I hope that she doesn't become, you know, tragic in the way that the Michael Jackson story 
[03:18:30]  has unfolded.  But again, a child star, no friends, you know, everyone around her is working for her.  Everyone's on the payroll.  Very hard to have a normal life.  You know, it takes an enormous amount of strength.  Physically, spiritually, emotionally, to overcome that kind of a life.  And I hope she does.  I mean, she seems to be on a much better track.  She seems to have gotten herself together.  And I hope she does.  I think the Michael Jackson story is a horribly tragic one. 
[03:19:00]  And, you know, from start to finish, there's lots of lessons for everybody in it.  You do a good show, too.  I mean, I've done your show once.  When is it on, so people know?  It's on Wednesdays, off and on, all day long, on Sirius and XM.  Okay.  What channel, though?  Do you know what channel?  155 and 102.  Okay, yeah.  You do a really good show.  Thank you.  Very honest.  It was nice meeting you.  Thank you so much.  Nice talking to you, Judith.  You, too.  Okay.  Judith Regan, everyone.  We're going to take a quick break, finish up.  We've got a little Tippy Tom, I Will Remember You thing to play. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, no.  That's going to be tough.  And I think Bobo is down the hall.  Maybe he can come in and say hi.  Broblo?  Did you see him intro Rich Voss at the Stress Factory?  No.  Oh.  Burr, Burr.  Why?  We'll do it again next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Tippy Tom is here in town.  I'm only here for another five years.  Now, the thing is this, is that I would like to say something.  You're saying something.  I'd say these people in this radio station, Opie and Anthony are cool dudes. 
[03:20:00]  And that's all I can say.  In loose moods.  I don't know what else, but do you want me to sing your song?  Opie and Anthony, Sirius 197, XM Duo 2, The Virus.  Opie and Anthony, goddamn, you motherfuckers did it.  On the day that everyone is Googling Michael Jackson, we were able to get Tippy Tom died as  the number one Google trend in America right now. 
[03:20:30]  How the fuck did we do that?  How the fuck did we do that?  Bam.  Keep Google bombing.  Tippy Tom died.  Right now it's number one, right, Danny?  Yeah.  Holy shit, is that cool.  Yeah.  Above all the Michael Jackson stuff, what is the top ten there?  Well, you got that mistress, the Maria Baleen Chapur.  Is she the South Carolina girl?  Yeah.  And then you got Farrah Fawcett, Lust for Life singer, Michael Jackson died, Tom Joyner, 
[03:21:00]  more Michael Jacksons.  So you think you can dance, results.  Elvis Presley or Michael Jackson.  But Tippy Tom died, number one on the Google Trends today.  God, that is pretty cool.  We're going to have a tribute show, a Tippy Tom tribute show.  It's going to be next weekend.  We're doing three days.  All Tippy Tom stuff next weekend, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Do we have it all for Fourth of July?  Just a Friday?  Yeah, Friday off, company holiday.  Aw, it's terrific. 
[03:21:30]  Thank you.  We're company guys.  Yeah, sure are.  Thank you.  Too bad they're not employee guys.  What?  That's good.  Did I just say, oh my God.  That's good.  Developing cleric says, harsh punishment in store for protest leaders.  What do you expect from that fucking...  Oh my God, savagery.  That picture of Tippy Tom is just amazing.  Can you send that to me, Danny?  Yeah.  I want to send that out to everybody.  That is an amazing picture of Tippy Tom. 
[03:22:00]  God damn it.  It should be an album cover.  Look at that picture.  I'll send it to everybody that follows me on Twitter.  I already sent it.  That is an amazing fucking picture.  I lied.  We got Bobo.  We got the Tippy Tom, I Will Remember You song,  which we do for all the people that leave or die  that are associated with this show.  Yes.  People are requesting Tippy Tom bits.  When Sandy Kane jerks off Tippy Tom, will that make the tribute show? 
[03:22:30]  Oh my God, I fucking forgot about that.  Yeah, he got a nice dick.  He got a nice dick, man.  Nice dick.  He got a nice guy.  Well, now that Tippy Tom's gone, now what?  Who becomes number one on the show as far as the freaks go?  Bobo?  He just yaps over everyone.  Dude, it's hilarious.  We got a new thing with him.  He goes...  Bobo, get in here for a couple minutes. 
[03:23:00]  You at least can say hi.  What the fuck?  He's here.  Comes here every Friday.  Looking for a headphone.  Hey, bro-blo.  Well, before I say anything, today...  Why don't you talk on the mic?  Before you say anything...  Yeah, what are you going to say?  Which is the dumbest thing ever, by the way.  Never liked that one.  Yeah.  Well, today is a very sad day.  Many celebrities have died, including what we have just found out about today.  What happened today?  Yeah, what happened?  Today, Tippy Tom just died. 
[03:23:30]  His loss was a very sad loss for everybody in the ONA community, including me, Bobo Springsteen.  I never got to meet the guy, damn it.  Why did he have to die before I ever got to meet him?  He produced some of the funniest moments on the show.  I even was once contemplating going on Halloween as him one day.  I'm not quite sure how to really get it, really look like Tippy Tom doing a costume.  Without actually smelling so bad.  He smelled like crap. 
[03:24:00]  He had a gambling problem.  I hear he was bisexual and had gay issues.  He was always drunk.  At least at some of that time he was in the hospital.  Tippy Tom was really funny.  And then he really got bugged by him.  He once sat in his chair.  Practically infected all of his stuff.  I think I hear rumor, has it, that you guys had to wear hazmat suits when he was in the studio.  I know I would have if I met him. 
[03:24:30]  I'd be wearing a hazmat suit.  I'm sure he slept in...  I'm sure he slept...  Camped out in Jersey.  Tippy Tom, you'll be dearly missed.  Wah, wah, wah.  It was too short.  Well, I think I got Tippy Tom's history.  Yeah, you did pretty good there.  I think I got a best summary.  Because I'd have to go through every single bit that Tippy Tom has been in.  And you guys have been on radio for so long. 
[03:25:00]  You know, I think we need to bring Tippy Tom's body into the studio one last time.  Jesus.  You know when, like, the mafia boss, like, dies and they have to bring it by the house or something.  I think we need Tippy Tom's body in studio.  No, I got a better one.  Oh, you do?  Oh, good.  Let's get a better one.  Let's have his ashes in a very smelly urn.  That's much better.  That smells like Tippy Tom.  Let's make sure his stench is rubbed onto that urn. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  And we'll leave it on display on a shelf.  That's better.  That could be kept as far from Anthony as possible.  You're right.  That's better.  But we'll have that stench there.  That's better.  This way Tippy Tom's presence is felt.  That's better.  So, on the phone, you were telling Ant and I that you were going to come in.  And, you know, finally explain the whole, you know, having sex with your brother thing.  You're about to admit it finally, which is good.  Well, today I kind of want to put that on the back burner because of what happened, but... 
[03:26:00]  What happened?  I'm just going to say there might have been some stuff that I don't remember that might have happened that I don't know for sure when I was younger.  Well, how old's your brother?  Wait, I was just joking.  I ain't going to say...  Who's older?  What the fuck?  I was just joking.  I'm just going to say my brother's older.  I was hoping for a no, no, no, no, no.  I'm just going to say it's not true, though.  What's not true?  What's not true?  You're not really sure?  You feel like you might have been touched as a kid, right? 
[03:26:30]  Well, I'm saying it might have...  I mean, who hasn't, Bobo?  Come on.  I don't feel like I haven't been, but there might have been stuff that I don't remember.  You really never know.  There could have easily been something I don't remember.  Like a wee-wee in your mouth?  No.  You know, like the Matrix, how they changed the program?  How old are you, Bobo?  I'm 27.  How old is your brother?  I'm not going to speak for someone else.  Well, you're just saying his age.  That's not exactly giving an opinion.  I'm just going to say he's in his late 30s. 
[03:27:00]  Okay, so he's about 10 years older than you?  Yeah, that's all I'm going to say is he's in his late 30s.  Let's not make any assumptions.  He's about 10 years older, but let's not speak for him.  Did he stick it in your pooper?  Well, I don't know what may have happened, but...  But you feel at this point that there might have been something that happened.  Well, everybody here seems to think there was something that happened,  because Evan misheard what I said.  He thought...  You know how Rich Voss... 
[03:27:30]  And he got tossed as a kid!  Whatever Voss says gets discombobulated.  Right, yeah.  Or combobulated.  Well, whatever I said, Evan might have heard...  I think everything Evan hears...  Bobo, we're really going to have to put you on the back burner because...  Everything Evan's...  Why, you just keep talking.  I'm thinking Evan's ears...  You just talk.  Just keep talking.  I think Evan...  Somebody kill him.  I think Evan...  Go right ahead.  It's all about you.  You talk.  I think Evan has something with his ears. 
[03:28:00]  We'll trade you.  Give us fire back.  We'll give you Bobo.  Yeah, you talk.  Sounds like Rich Voss.  Because, you know...  Yeah, you talk.  That's cool.  Who cares what everyone else is doing?  You talk.  Everything sounds like Rich Voss to Evan.  Why not make it about yourself on the biggest day...  Yeah, you talk.  ...in the history of the show and entertainment.  All about Bobo.  Bobo, it ain't...  All right, what?  Well, I got another important tribute.  This one is my Michael Jackson tribute.  Okay, go ahead.  From Bobo Springsteen.  All right.  Oh, from Bobo Springsteen.  Hurry up because Tippi Tom's brother wants to call in the show. 
[03:28:30]  Wait, because you want to call in the show?  Yes, that's right.  Let's do that now.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll do that for you.  Yeah, stop with the nonsense.  Wait, do we have him now?  We're getting him right now.  Yeah, let's talk about it.  All right, Bobo, do your tribute while we get...  As soon as he's on the phone.  Yeah, stop it.  As soon as he's on the phone, you scram.  That means you have seconds.  That means go now, Bobo.  All right.  Bobo Springsteen has a little tribute to Michael Jackson.  He said his own name in the tribute.  He isn't from Jersey, but he has some connections to New Jersey. 
[03:29:00]  That's what this song is about.  Michael Jackson has performed only three shows in New Jersey over the course of maybe possibly  a few times in 1988 in what's now known as the IZOT Center.  He also had issues with the promoter in Jersey.  Because of this, he ended up performing in New Jersey.  Bobo, I got a question.  What?  Are you trying to come up with the new Alice's Restaurant? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Your son is very wordy.  Yeah, very wordy.  Very wordy.  They don't really sound like songs.  I think we got Tom's brother on the phone.  Oh, good.  I'm just waiting for him to be put on hold.  Bobo, you're amazing.  Thank you.  Yes, magic.  Just magic every time.  Bobo.  Christian.  Yes.  Hi.  Hey, Christian.  It's Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton.  And Keith, the cop. 
[03:30:00]  How you doing, fellas?  Hi.  Well, to be completely honest with you, we're saddened by the news of your brother's passing  there.  Well, me too, obviously.  I can't say that I didn't expect this call at some point, but it's a little sooner than  I had hoped.  Yeah.  How long since you saw Tom?  I'm going to say 12 years, maybe 13 years.  How long was he homeless for?  We only knew Tom as the guy who was down his luck and drunk all the time, but obviously 
[03:30:30]  there's a much different guy that you know.  Well, you know, that was probably the last 20 years of his life actually turned into that.  But he was, you know, before that, he was a pretty active guy.  He had his own company and, you know, he was married.  He had a boy who is now probably about 14 years old, who I've actually never met.  But, you know, his life just fell apart, you know.  Alcohol and drugs.  Yeah, we, I think we did right by Tom. 
[03:31:00]  I mean, I don't know.  He did some great radio for us.  We took care of him when we could.  There was a time we did try to, like, clean him up and he was in the hospital and he was  completely sober and he, wow, he sounded like a completely different person.  He's a very naturally funny guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, he always loved the limelight.  Yeah.  You can probably see.  Sure.  And, you know, he was the type of guy that loved to be right in the middle of any kind 
[03:31:30]  of activity.  But, like I said, he sort of fell off the face of the earth once his wife decided to leave  him and he got into the alcohol and stuff.  And then New York is where he spent a lot of time in his early years.  So, I guess he felt that's where he was going to end up eventually.  And what's real weird is he actually told my mom years ago that he wanted to be a hobo. 
[03:32:00]  All right.  As funny as that sounds.  You sure he said B?  Was Tom gay?  Well, yeah.  Well, you know what?  The B part was there and the M part, I guess, eventually came out.  Yeah.  We didn't know if Tom was gay or not because then it came out that he had a son and he  was married.  We didn't know if it was just a phase he was going through or if he was actually a gay  guy.  No, no.  I wouldn't say he was actually gay, but I would say that he, let's say he dabbled in 
[03:32:30]  many activities.  Okay.  What was he into before he fell off the face of the earth?  Like, what did he enjoy doing?  Again, we only know, what did Tom enjoy doing?  Say when he met the girl that he wound up marrying, what kind of a guy was he?  What did he like doing?  Where did he work?  He loved to make money.  He had his own company watching windows out there in Reno and he loved to make money and  he was a nut about it and totally into his health. 
[03:33:00]  He was a yoga, you know, vegetarian nut, you know?  Oh, yeah.  He made a total turnaround here.  That's why it's real strange that his life went this way because I wouldn't have pictured  it.  Was there something that happened in his life that made him go all in with this thing?  Maybe the wife or any incident that you can think of?  No, I think the wife thing is that it sort of put him over the edge, but he was already 
[03:33:30]  on his way down because, like I said, he was making a lot of money at one point and doing  nothing but answering the phone and sitting home and, I guess, doing his drinking or whatever  else.  And he was very obsessive compulsive.  So when he did something, he did it full bore.  Did the wife leave him?  Do you think, was it because of the drinking that's kind of what sent her out the door?  That's definitely what I heard had actually triggered it, you know? 
[03:34:00]  But I never met her either because he had left years ago and he was out there and with the  occasional phone call, maybe.  So Tom was pretty much a hard drinker, but he was making a living and he could afford to  kind of sit home and just drink all he wanted.  And then once he lost that income, the drinking didn't slow down, but he had no way to kind  of, to financially support it.  Well, that's exactly what happened.  And then he just, he just sort of lost everything and ended up back here in town and basically 
[03:34:30]  started to tear up this town.  So, you know, nobody could really stand him.  He really turned into, you know, a bit too much to handle, let's say.  So, and then I guess he decided New York was his place.  Could you send us pictures of Tom, what he was like as a young man or what he was like  as a guy in his late teens or his early 20s or even as a kid as well?  We just, you know, we just want to kind of see the whole picture. 
[03:35:00]  We only know him at one point.  Yeah, in fact, I had already thought about doing that.  I just, I just, I have so much other stuff going on in my life right now that I didn't  get around to it.  But I think you guys would probably get a kick out of a few of these pictures.  Oh, yeah.  We really like Tom.  I mean, we, you know, we do what we do for the radio show, but we really like this guy.  And really, I mean, there was some concern all the time, you know, whether he was going  to make it or not.  And we always just assumed he was, you know.  Yeah, well, I always said that the only reason I think he was lasting this long was 
[03:35:30]  because he was so healthy when he was young.  Right.  And he was like totally obsessed with it.  And that's why he was, he was able to survive on the streets.  Sure.  You know.  But, yeah, I could send you some pictures and you'd probably, I could send you the reason  he called himself Golden Bun.  We got Keith in studio.  Now, Keith, what are we going to do here?  Because we got to get, we got to do the right thing for Tom.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, well, Christian and I are talking and Craig, who called earlier on for the funeral  home, has stepped up and Christian's been in touch with him as well.  Absolutely.  Next week, we're going to get Chris in to go down and take care of what we need to take  care of here in the city.  And then we'll make the arrangements and, you know, we'll figure it out.  And I know, I was explaining to Christian how, you know, the radio show here, you know,  we want to be a part of this and that the fans really will come out to bid him farewell 
[03:36:30]  because he was very beloved on the show.  They loved him.  Yeah, we used to do this homeless shopping spree.  And I don't even know what you've heard about it, Christian.  But thousands of people showed up to watch Tippy Tom and his friends shop at a mall every  holiday.  Did you have money and everything?  Do we have audio at all of when Tom made his exit from the bus?  There's audio we have of your brother coming off the bus and when he was announced, just  the people went, you know, they really liked him.  They went nuts for him.  Nuts.  I had actually caught a few things on, I guess it was YouTube and stuff like that. 
[03:37:00]  And it was the shopping spree.  That was the first time that I had heard that he was, you know, involved with you guys on  the radio here.  Right.  And from that point on, every now and then, I would sort of keep tabs on it.  And, you know, I have some friends that I told about it.  They all listened to you guys.  They would let me know when he was on the air and whatnot.  So it was every now and then, you know, I heard about him.  Yeah, he just, he was really funny on the show.  I mean, his timing was amazing. 
[03:37:30]  You know what, I know you guys caught a lot of fun out of him here and there.  But believe me, he ate it up.  Oh, yeah.  That's just it.  You know, he knew, had a role with everything that anyone threw at him.  And this, you know, this is a meat grinder, this show.  We beat the crap out of each other.  And he hung right in there.  He was great.  Yeah.  Well, like I said, he's always eating that kind of stuff up.  Nothing ever fades on me too much.  Yeah, we'd love to do something, just something. 
[03:38:00]  We don't know what, whether it's a cruise or something around Manhattan.  You know, just something with the listeners and kind of come out and have just a nice night.  And I don't know, we just, we really like the guy a lot.  Oh, they'll come out, believe me.  Yeah, they will.  Hey, I would really appreciate that.  I think Tom would also.  Oh, yeah.  You know, in advance, if you guys can arrange something like that, I would certainly, you know, thank you.  Awesome.  Are you, is he going to be buried or cremated?  Or what is your faith?  Well, probably cremated. 
[03:38:30]  That's, that's the first option, I guess.  Right.  But all that stuff will still be discussed.  I, I still have to contact a couple of my family members.  All right.  Have some talks and just, you know, basically decide where we're going with this.  Now, we know your mom passed away.  Your dad is, is still living?  Yes.  And is he, he, he kind of, he knows how Tom wound up and all that?  He has an idea, but he doesn't know the, you know, to what length Tommy actually went to, you know, ended up at, you know. 
[03:39:00]  My mom did.  In fact, it's, I, it's real weird because I had downloaded a photograph off of the Internet of him and I looked at it.  I was like, there's no way that that's my brother.  I took that photo to my mother.  Two seconds.  She said, that's Tommy.  So, um, but, uh, you know, it's just, it's, it's just a weird thing.  It's just, uh, something that, uh, like I said, I expected, but not so soon. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Damn.  Bummer.  Suck, man.  But I, I do appreciate any help you guys can do.  And, um.  Absolutely.  Yeah, we'll do the right thing.  I mean, he, he was unbelievable for us.  So, uh, Christian, we appreciate you calling the show today.  Yeah.  And once all of these arrangements are made, you believe me, you guys will know.  Okay.  Okay.  We'll, we'll definitely be in touch.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right, man.  All right, fellas.  Thank you.  Take care, man.  I'm Tippi Tom's brother.  Uh, two quick things. 
[03:40:00]  We got Tippi Tom actually talking about Michael Jackson.  It's a minute.  I got to hear this.  Yeah.  And then we got our, uh, I will remember you Tippi Tom thing.  Oh.  And then we got lots more to do with Tippi Tom in the coming days.  And, uh, next weekend, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, a three-day Tippi Tom tribute show.  Holy shit.  That's going to be amazing.  Uh, but first, uh, Tippi Tom talks about Michael Jackson.  Yeah, let's read the news.  Yeah, Michael Jackson's on trial there, Tippi Tom.  Let's go.  Okay, he says, Michael Jackson's trial continues in California. 
[03:40:30]  Uh, something the United...  I'm only cloaking.  Something that Jackson reportedly sell his, uh, Sony catalog to pay legal fees.  The hell's wrong with that?  All right, what's this story there, Tom?  I'm going to try to do this like it's legit.  His Sony catalog to pay legal fees.  You didn't know what a Sony catalog stands for. 
[03:41:00]  What does it stand for, Graywolf?  Graywolf, get in there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no.  It's about going to K-Mark's.  I don't know anything.  And finally, little children's underwear.  It's half off.  I think someone's wearing a lighting before they got here.  You have to read the right.  Look, it reads like this.  Yeah, go ahead, Wolf.  Michael Jackson's trial continues in California.  Macaulay Culkin will testify in the case.  Jackson to reportedly sell his Sony catalog to pay for legal fees. 
[03:41:30]  In other words, he's broke.  Oh, my God, that is so terrible.  He's broke.  I can't believe he did this.  He can't do the boomcast with his golden buns.  I can't believe he did this.  I can't believe he did this.  He's so passionate about everything he's talking about.  You're going to miss that motherfucker.  We're out of here for now.  Are we going to play the I Will Remember You?  Yeah, we'll end with this damn thing.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Yep, Tuesday.  Later on. 
[03:42:00]  Tuesday for Jimmy, Monday for Aunt and I.  Yeah.  And all of us Wednesday.  Later.  I will remember you.  All right, let's get Tippi Tom in studio.  He's been waiting out there.  Open that door, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time.  I'm over there.  In a few months easily, it's Tippi Tom.  Tippi!  All right, Tippi Tom.  All the world.  The original.  The original.  There's all these fake Tippi Toms out there.  But I'm the real Tippi Tom. 
[03:42:30]  Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom, everyone.  Let's hear it for Tippi Tom.  The thing that I'd like to do next is what we talked about earlier,  is to check your prostate.  So you can put the finger up the ass, huh?  Yeah.  Is that okay?  Yeah, or you rotate a little bit.  Can you do some Frank Sinatra?  Yeah!  Oh, about time!  It is about time.  You need another shot before you do Frank Sinatra?  It's about fucking right about time.  It's about fucking right.  Get the hell out of here. 
[03:43:00]  Where's he going?  Fucking right!  Yeah, go!  Get out of here!  I will remember me...  Softly.  I will leave you softly.  Come on!  Who did that?  Or one more day...  Is he complaining that someone farted?  After all the years...  He's perfect for Frank Sinatra.  Come on, guys!  Fuck me up, man!  That song was awful. 
[03:43:30]  Why are you so difficult?  Here's the deal.  You get all that money if we get your underpants.  You want them?  Yeah!  You can have them any...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Nice gaffes!  There's no...  There's no effing way...  There's...  Oh, my God!  Look at those underwear.  I yell out.  Oh, my God!  There's a fucking load in the back of them!  Oh, my God!  What's the matter?  You act like you've never seen fucking...  Filthy other place fade away.  Wait a minute!  Fuck! 
[03:44:00]  Get away from me!  I will remember me...  No!  I need you!  No!  I need you!  I need you!  I need you!  I need you!  Dammit!  Dammit!  That's all strictly German!  That movie's not tragic!  That was wrong!  The Germans were wrong!  I got a blowjob last night! 
[03:44:30]  That's right!  Cover your eyes and get in there!  And get your money!  Walk around it!  Lysol's not your kryptonite!  Go!  Go!  Get away!  Go!  Go!  Just cover your eyes!  You touch it after you get $100!  Now, wait a minute!  What is it?  Oh!  Oh, it's shit in the cup!  Now what's going on?  I was like, I eat the shit!  Boy, that sounds good to me! 
[03:45:00]  I'm afraid to love you!  I'm afraid to love you!  Wow!  What is that?  Does he have a pulse?  Does he have a pulse?  Yeah, does he have a pulse?  Oh, I hope he didn't kill the homeless guy!  Does he have a pulse?  I think it's very, very faint!  Go!  Stewardess!  What?  Aeroplane!  Things on a plane!  But it wasn't you!  I'm thinking Tippi Tom's underpants must-taves today. 
[03:45:30]  Tippi Tom!  Oh, fuck!  No way!  No way!  Oh, fuck!  Oh, shit!  Just kind of touch it right.  Just kind of bend over.  You're going to do this?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Go on the top!  I will not use any of those things again. 
[03:46:00]  I want everything disinfected.  Hey, it's on the entire side of the studio, and I will not sit next to you!  I'm fired!  You're out of business now, buddy!  Hello again, my friend.  He's singing.  I love you just the way you are. 
[03:46:30]  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Oh, this is from Tippi Tom.  That's it?  All right.  He just threw the mic down.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  That doesn't sound good at all.  You all right, Tippi?  What's the matter?  I'm dying.  I'll be dead.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha </pre>
