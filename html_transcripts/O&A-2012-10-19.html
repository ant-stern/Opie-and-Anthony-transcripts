<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly from one subject to another with little transition.  The show began with a highly profane rant about the New York Yankees' failed playoff run, targeting Alex Rodriguez and an anonymous player who blamed the fans.  This segued into a discussion of the NHL lockout, criticizing both the players and Gary Bettman for their greed.  The dilapidated Nassau Coliseum also came under fire.  A lengthy, vulgar segment followed, mocking hipsters in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with frequent, disparaging commentary on their appearance and perceived pretentiousness, and containing racist remarks about different areas of Brooklyn. Sal, a frequent (though not in-studio) guest, was repeatedly the target of this mockery for his apparent embrace of hipster culture.

The show then delved into a detailed account of their “Jocktober” prank targeting a small-market radio station in Grand Junction, Colorado. This involved hacking their Facebook page, resulting in a flood of obscene comments and requests to join their group.  The hosts discussed the station’s inadequate response and the subsequent removal of a local news report that misrepresented the event. Comedian Rich Vos called in, sharing anecdotes about his own experiences with the show, past radio work, and a false death report.  The hosts also reflected on their history with comedians and their past feud with Mark Perino. This discussion shifted to a comical anecdote about Opie receiving a bag of pre-toasted Bimbo bread as a baby gift, leading to a digression about childhood poverty and a disastrous attempt to microwave the bread on air, which resulted in a smoky studio and panicked reactions.  Listeners called in to contribute to this discussion.  A “hipster” themed game was briefly considered before the segment ended.

The next segment started with discussions of mundane food products, specifically A&P’s “No Frills” brand and the design of egg noodle bags, before returning to the ill-fated Bimbo bread microwaving stunt. This led to a sexually explicit "Adventures in Docking" segment featuring a caller's description of a gay sexual practice and subsequent urologist visit.  The hosts then transitioned to a discussion of Rob Zombie’s music, a rumored fight between Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson, and a listener's repetitive phrase, "I got a tree on my house.”  A significant portion of this segment was dedicated to judging entries for the show's jingle contest, many of which contained sexually suggestive and highly offensive lyrics. "Radio Wizard," one particularly memorable entry, was played repeatedly.  "Jocktober," as a recurring feature showcasing outrageous radio moments, was also discussed, referencing listener submissions including sexually explicit photos submitted to a radio station's Facebook page.  There was a brief mention of Jenny Hutt and a story about obtaining a signed Shaq poster for Jim Norton.

The following segment heavily featured listener-submitted photos and videos posted on the WBEE Facebook page, many of which were extremely offensive, crude, and sexually suggestive; including altered photos of the hosts in inappropriate scenarios.  A significant portion focused on mocking a radio co-host, Terry Clifford, for her appearance and weight, after she shared a story about being criticized for her eyebrows. The hosts also reacted to a viral video of a redneck mother and daughter's online verbal attack.  The segment concluded with Opie expressing regret over the Terry Clifford segment and a discussion on erectile dysfunction (including a comedic bit with Pat Cooper), upcoming projects, and Obama and Romney’s appearance at the Al Smith dinner.

The final segment began with a discussion of a small donation to a disabled woman, transitioning to a past NYC scam exploiting disabled people.  This led to a discussion of Sam Roberts' YouTube videos (including a supposed Hulk Hogan video) and the Steven Singer Jewelers-sponsored jingle contest with a $2000 prize. Numerous offensive jingles were played and critiqued, including one referencing an aborted fetus and another using the n-word.  Callers suggested alternative prizes, including a day in the "Jocktober seat." The latter half featured an interview with Vivica A. Fox, who discussed her show "Prank My Mom," her Hollywood experiences, her relationship with 50 Cent,  her work on *Kill Bill*, the BET Awards, and the challenges of navigating public life in the hip-hop community. Nicole from the Morning Mashup briefly joined the conversation.  The show ended with further mockery of the Colorado radio station and their listeners' actions; Bill Burr’s appearance in Australia and a significant Australian fanbase were also briefly mentioned, along with ongoing mockery of an unnamed intern, Eric.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot.  Do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten eggs and sewage. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O and A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie the destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted.  Pied to these people.  Up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton.  Lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks. 
[00:05:00]  This one's gonna hurt.  Oh, you want to hear the greatest of all?  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Hi.  It's Friday here in New York City.  It certainly is.  Is it a different day anywhere else that we're heard?  Just in New York City?  It's gotta be Saturday somewhere, right?  Probably Australia.  Yeah, we got fans down there.  Somewhere like there.  L.A.  Good Friday or Saturday at 8 a.m. 
[00:05:30]  Bill Burr's in Australia.  Is he?  Playing the Sydney Opera House.  My toilet bowl's going the wrong way.  Jesus.  Yeah, going local for Sydney, Australia.  He's down there.  Oh, there you go.  And then one of our super fans, who I think turned on the whole country to our radio show,  said, hey, I'm going to see Bill Burr tonight.  Nice.  Which might have happened already, because I'm not really sure when tonight is for them.  Yeah, whatever that is.  And he said, well, on the night before, there were a lot of ONA fans there. 
[00:06:00]  Really?  Yeah, this guy's all-knowing.  I gotta get down there.  I want to say his name is Corey, but that might be Hacked.  Oh, Corey.  But it actually might be another Corey.  Yes, Corey.  Boo.  Boo.  It's Ghost Steve.  Ghost Steve.  God, we got lots to talk about today.  You're fucking Yankees stink.  Yep.  I ain't even fucking frontin', yo.  I ain't gonna front.  You know what?  How do you work hard all year long and then completely fall apart? 
[00:06:30]  Fell apart.  In four days.  It happens.  Five days, whatever.  They went through a slump during the worst possible fucking time.  A slump.  It was one for the ages.  A complete meltdown.  An epic slump.  Epic slump.  Bad luck.  Fucking, it just was not good.  I mean, you got Joe Girardi's father dying.  That's gotta affect the team.  In some way, sure.  And then Jeter getting fucking injured.  Then he breaks his ankle.  Then you got A-Rod flirt with people in the stands.  Distraction.  That whole A-Rod, yeah.  And then you got Cano not hitting the ball. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  You got some major fucking players not hitting at all.  I mean, last night, what did they have?  Two hits?  Two hits.  It was a two-hitter.  That's it.  Two fucking hits.  Two hits.  Eight-one was the final run.  One run.  I mean, no one was hitting the ball.  It was terrible.  CeCe got pulled out in the fourth inning, was it?  It just, it was terrible.  They couldn't do anything.  They got an eight-run spanking.  Yeah, you got spanked last night.  No one, you know what it is, though?  It's a good way to go out, though.  No one was, yeah, just complete meltdown.  No one had any delusions, which is good. 
[00:07:30]  Like, it wasn't, I didn't feel like, oh, fuck!  It was just, oh, okay, great.  The agony's over.  Well, I was reading the sports page, and the players are blaming the fans at Yankee Stadium.  Their feelings were hurt.  Oh, yeah?  Why?  Because the seats were empty and shit?  Their feelings were hurt because of the abuse A-Rod was getting and the lack of people at  the games.  Yeah.  And their feelings were hurt.  Poor Yankees.  Who said that?  Who would say that?  An anonymous Yankee.  An anonymous! 
[00:08:00]  Another one of those entitled, everyone wins a trophy type guys, right?  Well, you can't really say that.  Guess what?  You suck it up.  You fucking suck it up.  Suck it?  You suck it up?  Our feelings were hurt because they were booing in our own stadium.  Wah!  Put your name on it!  Worry about it.  The Yankees have never been booed, like, just because it's in your own stadium.  First time, uh...  I'm pretty sure you can still try and hit the ball.  First time with the sweep in many, many years for the Yankees.  Yeah.  Since the Reds in 76.  Yep.  And then stupid fucking A-Rod. 
[00:08:30]  He should just keep his mouth shut.  They talked to him after the game, and he's like, no, I intend to be a Yankees.  I'll just stay here in New York.  I like New York.  I plan on staying in New York.  That's how pompous this idiot is.  Everyone fucking hates him.  Even the hardcore guys that were A-Rod fans, they've turned on him.  But he's like, no, I plan on staying in New York.  Do ya?  It's his choice.  Do everyone a favor and get the fuck out.  It's his choice, man.  I'm not even a Yankees fan, and it bothers me.  Yeah.  Do the right thing and say, all right, look, here are the teams I would allow you to trade 
[00:09:00]  me to, because he's got that no-trade clause.  And get the fuck out.  You're done here.  He's done here.  He ain't going anywhere.  Chris Russo tweeted that he was almost hoping that A-Rod hit a home run in his pinch hit yesterday.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because that was almost more anti-Yankee than just, like, striking out.  And I agreed.  It would have been great.  He went 0-2 in his two pinch hits.  He had a weak grounder, right?  Yeah.  It just, it was not a good playoff run for the Yankees, man. 
[00:09:30]  I plan to be here and produce for this team for the next five years.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  The Yankees fans probably broke their TVs when they saw that.  So what's it going to be?  Tigers and Cardinals?  Is that what they're looking at?  A little rematch?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah?  How do you know that yet?  But, oh, I mean, it just looks like it's going to be that.  Yeah, the Cardinals are, they're walking all over the Giants.  They really are.  What, they lead 3-1?  I can't believe it!  My Giants!  Yeah.  Chris Russo likes those Giants, right? 
[00:10:00]  Loves the Giants.  That's his team.  So what, you got Detroit and the Cardinals?  That's a weird World Series.  That'd be great if the Cardinals won after, a year after losing Pujols.  Right.  Like, personally, I would think that was great.  Because everybody was like, oh, my God, we're dead now.  You know, Pujols is leaving.  And Tony La Russa left to go back the next year and win.  I think that'd be cool.  That is pretty cool, I guess.  Fuck them.  Fuck baseball.  Who gives a fuck?  It's over.  Fuck baseball.  But they're playing baseball?  Baseball's over for you?  See?  They're playing baseball?  I'm done.  I've been out of baseball for three, four months.  It's nice. 
[00:10:30]  It's nice to be in this position.  I'm free.  I'm free now.  I've been free for a while.  I'm free.  Like how it feels?  Well, Travis was free a little before me.  I got a weak head start.  Yeah, you did.  Oh, my God, I've been free for a long time.  You've been free since April.  I've been free for years.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, one dopey fan got to me.  He goes, will you stop talking about the Mets?  You don't even know the players on the team.  You've been free since 86.  And then I wanted to tweet him back that I did.  And then I realized this person was right. 
[00:11:00]  I probably couldn't name two, three players in the Mets right now.  I'm so out of baseball.  No Subway Series.  No Subway Series this year.  The Subway Series.  The Subway Series.  Are you kidding me?  My Jets have to play the Pats, though.  Oh, there you go.  My Jets.  Well, the Pats aren't really the powerhouse of yesteryear.  The Pats are beatable.  Definitely.  Yeah, I know, but that Brady is a fucking animal.  You can't count him out.  I love sports cliches.  You can't count him out.  You can never count Brady out.  You know, you can't count Brady out, ever. 
[00:11:30]  Can't count that guy out.  You know there's only two teams in the AFC that have a winning record?  I know.  No, the Jets have no business.  Are they, like, they're leading the division?  Everyone's 3-3 in the East.  Wow.  The Jets have no business leading the AFC East.  Are you kidding me?  Even the Dolphins are 3-3?  Yep.  Wait, everyone's 3-3.  You said that.  The Ravens and the Texans are the only two teams in the AFC that have a winning record.  Everyone else is 500 or below.  Wow.  But in the East.  In the East, everyone's 3-3.  Everyone's 3-3. 
[00:12:00]  That's unbelievable.  That's kind of sad.  That's weird.  Eh, whatever.  At least I don't feel like my team's out of it yet.  No.  Definitely not.  Yeah, that's true.  My team.  Your team.  My team.  My team.  And everyone got excited about hockey, but wow.  Who's to blame for this?  I hate Bettman, so I went right after Bettman yesterday.  I don't like Gary Bettman at all.  And then everyone's like, well, actually, he's not the problem here.  No? 
[00:12:30]  There was an offer, a 50-50 split for the players.  And the players, most people figured the players would sign that immediately.  And the players were like, oh, go fuck yourself.  Let's think about this.  And have they officially rejected it?  Well, the players sent back three proposals.  Right.  Three counteroffers.  Yeah, but Bettman assumed this was a done deal.  All right, here's your 50-50 split.  I'm breaking it way down.  Really dumbing it down.  And then the players, everyone assumed, would just sign immediately and they would start  the hockey season.  They didn't. 
[00:13:00]  Because they could get 82 games in.  Yeah.  And the players actually went, well, that's nice and all, but here's our counterproposals.  And they rejected all three of them.  Who, the NHL?  Yeah.  And now Bettman says they're nowhere close.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, it sounded like it was just about a done deal.  Well, it sounded promising.  They were going to be playing in the beginning of November at some point.  And now, back to no way, huh?  It sounded good because, you know, the owners were starting to, you know, budge.  Yeah.  So you were hoping maybe the players would budge, but I guess.  Wow.  So who's to blame?  I don't know, because nobody, they're not saying. 
[00:13:30]  You're a hockey fan.  Who do you blame?  Bettman's always hateable.  It's hard to just blame one side.  You've got billionaires and millionaires fighting over money.  Like, really, who's to blame?  They're both sides are to blame.  They're just.  They're both greedy.  They're just.  Man.  Both sides are just.  Everybody wants their money.  Man, both sides are just extremely dumb because it's a sport that had some momentum.  It was finally starting to, you know, feel like.  Yeah.  Hockey's the last sport that can survive another strike.  Right.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah, man.  Nobody cares to begin with. 
[00:14:00]  You can't blow off that momentum.  It'll hurt them for years.  But they know better.  And the second they come back, the fucking arenas will be full of people that just.  Most of us.  Go back in.  Yeah, most.  Yeah.  Only in the cities that care.  It's not like.  Hockey's in trouble, man.  You'll see.  I mean, the Garden will still pack out.  Rangers games.  Yeah.  It's just amazing that people don't go, fuck you.  We're done with you.  And really show the.  Because we're not sports.  Of course we do.  Well, I don't know, though.  I mean, playoff baseball in the Bronx. 
[00:14:30]  Empty seats.  It's true.  That's bad.  People get so jaded.  Really is.  I don't think it's.  I don't think.  What is the whole thing with the fact that Yankee Stadium was.  Is it the prices of the seats?  Is it that people are so jaded about the Yankees that they're not going to be there unless it's the World Series?  I think it's both.  It's.  No, man.  There's a lot of people out there that would love to take their kids to a Yankees playoff game.  Then they could have.  There were plenty of $20 and $50 seats all the way up top.  It's not. 
[00:15:00]  But it's more than the $20 and $50 seats.  It's everything else.  Well, then that's just like a regular season game, though.  Yeah, but $20 and $50.  Yeah.  That's a lot of money for people.  That's the amount of money.  And then you got to pay.  You got to get everyone food and you got to park and bring your snacks.  Huh?  Eat before you go to the game.  Oh, bring some carrot sticks with you.  Bring some carrot sticks to the ball game.  Are you allowed to at least bring your food in?  I don't even know.  There's a lot of these places.  Then they fucking do that to you.  Bring your own hot dogs.  They check you before you go in.  They were frisking people at the fucking gates. 
[00:15:30]  Really?  Amazing.  I don't know what they were looking for, but they were fucking frisking people.  I used to sneak peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in.  Watch it.  Right around my crotch.  You want to fucking feel my crotch, you're going to feel my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  I bet it would have just been your sandwich.  Of course.  All right, here's everybody's sandwiches.  Yeah, all right, everybody.  Of course.  I'm one of those guys.  I used to bring my own food in all the time.  I used to do that at movie theaters, but not sporting events.  Most sporting events have just shitty food.  Not anymore.  It's gotten better.  Food's like the most important thing.  Not at the Coliseum. 
[00:16:00]  Well, no.  Not when you're buying Capital One popcorn.  Yeah, Capital One popcorn.  Exactly.  I got some salmon sandwiches.  I made sandwiches.  I made sandwiches.  No, if I go to a Rangers game or a Devils game, they got good food.  But for some reason, the Coliseum can't even figure that part out.  No.  It's all the same shit.  A dopey hot dog, a dopey pretzel.  Or you can walk around the entire Coliseum to find the one good place that sells something  maybe a little different. 
[00:16:30]  It's almost impossible.  Because, first of all, you can't walk around the entire Coliseum because they've decided  that narrow hallways are still the thing.  Yeah, that stinks.  Nassau Coliseum has nothing that is even close to a concourse.  Or modern or concourse.  Have you been in that place?  It's been years.  And it just sucks.  It's unbelievable how bad it is.  And then they got so desperate, they started putting tents up so you could go outside to  have room.  But the problem is, hockey's played in the winter. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, it's freezing.  So then you got people out there and they set up these bars and stuff.  And people are sitting there trying to have a beer or a cigarette or whatever.  Freezing their fucking asses off.  But the concourse is so packed, they have no choice.  So they're being pushed almost outside just to be able to breathe a little bit.  Yeah, this studio is definitely wider than the concourses.  It's amazing.  When you look at other stadiums and arenas and whatnot, how modern they are and how wide  the concourses are.  And they got shops.  It's like you're in a mall and stuff. 
[00:17:30]  And then the Coliseum, it's like a fucking school hallway that you're walking through.  This was built in another time.  Yeah, it's just horrible.  And, you know, we can't figure that out.  I'm so 40 years old.  I'm so fucking done with all the shit we can't figure out.  Yeah, man.  The Coliseum was around when I was a kid.  I'm not even close to a kid anymore.  The fuck?  Terrible.  So terrible.  Whatever.  Good luck to hockey.  I don't even give a fuck.  Have fun.  I usually get excited about hockey. 
[00:18:00]  I don't give a fuck this year.  You can go see them when they move to Brooklyn.  Oh, boy.  Well, that'd be cool.  You think that would happen?  They're playing one home game there this year, right?  They're playing against the Devils.  And, you know, they would love a hockey team over there.  Sure, why not?  The Brooklyn Nets.  Fucking Brooklyn's just going to grab everything up, huh?  Well, I think they need hockey.  So it's almost like it's going to happen.  It feels like it's going to happen.  What would be the roadblock in the way of that? 
[00:18:30]  At this point, I don't see much.  I don't see what would actually stop that.  Because they need a new arena.  So then there was talk about, well, they'll build some kind of arena near Citi Field where the Mets play.  What were they calling the, oh, the lighthouse.  The lighthouse project.  Meet me at the lighthouse.  This is too inside for people, huh?  They've got to get rid of that fucking stupid Islanders logo, though, than if they're going to go to Brooklyn.  Get something fucking a little tougher.  Go back to the fishermen.  Oh, God, the Gordons of Gloucester fishermen. 
[00:19:00]  The fish stick team.  Team fish sticks.  No, I don't think the homies.  That was stunk.  I don't think the homies are going to come out for hockey.  Yeah, some hockey motherfuckers.  Get the Islanders in a black jersey.  I'm going to get my skates on.  I don't think they're coming out for that.  Yeah, that's worse.  They try to toughen it up.  You've got to hope for the hipsters.  The hipsters in Brooklyn are going to come out for the hockey.  Brooklyn hipsters.  Because you're not going to get the homies, man.  No way.  No, and the hipsters will because, you know, hockey's not cool, so it is cool.  No, hipsters will absolutely.  Dude, I gave.  I'm going to have to deal with hipsters if the fucking Islanders move to Brooklyn. 
[00:19:30]  And, you know, the Islanders aren't a great team, so, like, they'll root for them because  they're not that great.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, I gave fucking.  I gave Whitestone a try.  I went to Whitestone.  What's Whitestone?  In fucking Brooklyn.  You know where that is?  What's Whitestone?  I don't even know.  It's fucking.  Where is it?  Is it an arena?  No, no.  Just kind of the area.  Oh, the area.  Was it Whitestone or?  No, no.  Not Whitestone.  Sorry.  I'm fucking.  Williamsburg?  Williamsburg.  Sorry.  I don't say Whitestone. 
[00:20:00]  Whitestone.  It's one of those fucking bridges.  No, no.  Williamsburg.  Sorry.  That's where the hipsters are.  Williamsburg.  Dude.  It stinks.  Why does it stink?  Wall-to-wall hipsters.  And there's really nothing going on there but a fuckload of Asian restaurants.  Like, you can't go like, ah, you know, I want a fucking steak or burger joint or something.  It's all these zen fucking shit.  Fusion restaurants?  Asian places.  Yeah.  And like, man, we're going to open a soup kitchen, but not for hipsters. 
[00:20:30]  Sal lives in Williamsburg.  Sal?  Dude, that fucking figure.  Just another reason to hate Sal more.  What a fucking hipster.  Does he really?  Of course he does.  Dude, I saw more pork pie hats.  More dumb pork pie hats.  And fucking shiny suit jackets over t-shirts. 
[00:21:00]  Dude, you live there?  I love it there, dude.  He loves it.  Why?  It is the worst shit fucking area.  Why do you love Williamsburg, Brooklyn?  Which is where all the hipsters are hanging.  I will admit that there are way too many disgusting hipsters there.  Dude, it's you.  What are you talking about?  You are one.  Yeah, you've dressed down a little bit as a hipster, but you can tell you're a hipster.  It's terrible.  And it is filled with young pussy, dude.  It is amazing, dude.  There's so much.  Are you one of those guys? 
[00:21:30]  I'm not one of those guys, but there's just.  Guys just get pushy.  I saw.  But guys just get pushy.  You know, I always hated the guy.  Hey, there's so much pussy in this area.  Not a pussy.  Not a pussy.  Let's line up some pussy tonight.  I saw a few pussy.  Guys just get pussy.  I saw a few pussy.  Yeah.  But it wasn't this big fucking.  I've seen more pussy in other places.  I saw a lot of hipsters with their chicks with them.  Do you remember where you went?  Yeah.  Where did you go?  Because there's some sketch areas. 
[00:22:00]  There's some nice areas.  What's a sketch area?  Is that like sketchy?  East Williamsburg?  It's sketchy, man.  I went.  There's some sketch in this area.  Right when you get over the bridge and off the train.  Okay.  That's where I was, motherfucker.  Okay, so.  Yeah, that's like.  It stunk.  That's pretty nice around there.  No, it stunk.  It was terrible.  There was nothing to do.  Why are you venturing out these days?  I was just out and about.  I was actually.  It was right after Red Eye.  And Bill Schultz was like.  Knew somebody that was going to be at a bar there.  So he was like.  Meet me there.  So I went. 
[00:22:30]  And I was fucking flabbergasted by the suckiness of that fucking area.  But man, it's all about the hipsters.  Stunk.  You know, I had one pair of skinny jeans.  And this goes back years.  And Bob Kelly told me my jeans were too tight.  And I went home and I threw them away.  I never told Bob Kelly that.  All of his jeans are too tight.  Yeah, exactly.  He should be worried about his own jeans.  Coveralls are too tight.  And ever since, I've had a bag of your jeans.  There you go.  Thanks to Bob Kelly.  I didn't realize. 
[00:23:00]  I didn't realize that maybe I was being influenced by these dumb hipsters.  Where do you go to get a burger?  It's all fucking Asian.  Goddamn fucking Vietnamese food.  Dude, every restaurant on that main drag where you get off the train at the first stop is all Asian places.  There's a lot of American places.  No, there's not.  There was one pizza joint.  That's it.  And there was some fat black guy and his wigger friend in there yelling about pizza.  Yo, dog.  You got to get the pepperoni.  Nice. 
[00:23:30]  Man, look at them.  Them slices is mad big.  Yo, man.  Three dollars.  This guy was ordering pizza.  Everyone had to know what he was ordering.  And it took him five minutes to order a slice because he just had to fucking, he had to wigger it up.  Yo, dog.  That's mad slices, yo.  It stunk.  Where I live is actually still pretty Italian, which I like.  You know, it's not as like.  Yeah, Dago hipsters.  Great.  Great.  Pork pie hats.  Fucking ironic suit jackets. 
[00:24:00]  Guys rolling around on razor roller board scooters because it's fucking weird.  I will admit that.  We used to, then we're hipsters.  We were well before our time on that one.  You know, we invented the razor board scooter.  Yes, razor roller board scooter.  Razor roller board scooter.  Do people know that?  I don't know.  When we were fucking huge in radio a long time ago, they came to us at NAW.  Razor?  We had a massive campaign for them.  No one knew who the, what the fuck it was.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  And then we had literally, and I'm going to say literally because it's true, the first two.  They brought the first two.  And we used to use them to get.  And we would roll down the hallways.  We used to use them for transportation between the office and the studio.  It was great.  Oh.  We kicked off that whole campaign.  I'm not even, I'm not fronting, man.  You have to realize that.  No one knew what those fucking things were.  You had it before they were cool.  And then they were cool.  And then the hipsters used them.  It became ironic.  Because now it's ironic.  Did you see these people?  I hate those people. 
[00:25:00]  Why, man?  Were they there?  Yes.  That was everyone walking around.  No, it's true.  I mean, I will completely admit.  And the people, if you go to a restaurant, they'll be very pretentious towards you.  And you just have to give it right back to them.  Why is he, why is he, why is he?  Well, why would you want to live that way?  It would be so much work.  Yeah, why would you want to live that way?  Like Sal has infiltrated their community.  Yeah.  If Sal was in the restaurant, Ant would look at Sal and be like, ugh, another hipster.  Of course.  Dude, you are in denial, man.  You're that guy.  Yes.  You're the guys.  He wanted to live in Williamsburg so bad.  I kept telling him, I'm like, there are so many more better places, like in Brooklyn 
[00:25:30]  or Queens, that you can get more for your money.  And he's like, no, I got to go to Williamsburg.  I got to go to Williamsburg.  I got a great deal where I live.  And I love my neighbor.  The ratio of women to men there is absurd.  It really is.  It's almost too easy.  Is that the pussy you were talking about earlier?  Yeah.  Sal, going out and getting some pussy.  You just need to walk around with fucking giant sunglasses and a corncob pipe.  What the fuck?  Oh, anything that's hipster.  Oh, God. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Look, man.  Yeah, that's it.  Exactly.  That is exactly it.  Look, man.  That's got to be a gay hipster, right?  I'm cool.  No, that's just a regular guy.  I'm wearing an 80s feather earring and I ride a unicycle.  Yeah.  Wow.  You're outrageous.  Fucking hate it.  You know, this is really funny, but I'm starting to think maybe we're sounding like our fucking  fathers.  No, hipsters suck for every age.  I hope.  I hope.  Hipsters suck for every fucking age. 
[00:26:30]  So what is the hipster all about?  Just the weird combinations?  You have to have two weird combinations?  Yes.  You got to have something weird going on.  Like what?  Something strange.  What?  Like a bow tie and maybe a tricycle?  Exactly.  You're wearing a giant...  How about a fucking polyester suit from the 70s with a giant lapel?  Sure.  And loafer.  And penny loafers.  And penny loafers.  That's it.  You just need a couple of weird...  Like someone would look and go, man! 
[00:27:00]  They got a thrift store right there, too.  Really?  For them to fucking buy their shit.  Like would corduroys and ski goggles be something to hit?  Thank you.  I've seen that on the train before.  There you go.  Of course you have.  I've seen ski goggles on the train before.  The train going there, too, was like a freak fucking...  It is.  Dude, they're all in there just wearing the weirdest things.  I've never also...  I've never seen so many twinks in my life.  Yeah.  A lot of little twinkie guys wearing fucking hot pants and fucking colorful little shirts.  Wait, hot pants or what?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Hot pants and then maybe one of those neckerchiefs.  Oh.  Yeah.  Something like that.  A neckerchief.  What if you wore suspenders and golf shoes?  Fantastic.  That would be good.  I'd fit in.  Suspenders and golf shoes.  Nice.  It's all about the mustache, too.  The big mustache.  Intricate mustache is very important.  Sure.  Sure.  I saw a mustache the other day in Central Park.  I just started staring at this guy.  Was he a hipster?  He had to be.  It was like...  It was like...  I can't...  It was like the Raleigh fingers, but it was completely straight out. 
[00:28:00]  Is that a new look?  Yeah.  And then the guy's looking at me like, how dare you look at me?  And I'm like, well, fuck you.  Your mustache is ridiculous.  What am I supposed to do?  That is the thing.  Like, the hipsters, they want that.  I know.  I'm referring to him in the third person.  I get it.  Yes.  I get it.  Yeah, because Sal came in here trying to grow a mustache, and we all made fun of him,  so he stopped.  I can't grow a mustache.  It's true.  Oh, boy.  He tried to grow one until we made fun of him.  He's a hipster.  You haven't done anything for this radio show yet.  Could you grow us a mustache, a hipster mustache? 
[00:28:30]  If you guys wanted to, I would gladly do it.  Start today.  I will start right now.  He would love that.  I would love a hipster mustache.  Because then that means that he's just assimilating to the community.  But you have to go a while, because you've got to start, you know, curling the edges and  stuff.  Oh, you want to do a handlebar.  Okay.  Whatever.  I don't know.  Whatever makes you a hipster.  Okay.  But the whole hipster mentality is like doing the anti of the anti of the anti.  Yes, man.  But now it's a joke.  It is.  Because now people are overthinking it, like, well, how do I look anti?  Yeah.  That's not how it came about.  Yeah, just fucking going around with a mood ring and a monocle. 
[00:29:00]  That's it.  I got off the train the other day.  This girl was wearing a really tight leotard from head to toe.  It was silver.  She was wearing a silver wig and she was handing out, like, you know, local business flyers.  It's just.  She's outrageous.  Look out.  Look out.  And then Sal said, this is where I got to live.  Right.  I love living here.  I love my neighborhood.  Look at all the pussy.  Yeah.  Who needs burgers where you can get muff burgers?  A lot of pussy here.  You know, the guy that talks about pussy like that usually doesn't get pussy, right? 
[00:29:30]  Okay.  That's fine.  If you want to say that.  You mean AJ Poopy shits over here?  Oh, boy.  AJ Poopy shits.  That's timeless.  I'm not.  When you hang out with a guy that all he talks about is pussy, he's the guy not getting the  pussy.  I'm not saying I get an insane amount of pussy.  I'm saying there is a very high ratio of women to men in Williamsburg.  I didn't see it.  I saw gangs of hipster guys walking around being very loud and just.  We should do a live event there.  I bet we'd kill it. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  We'd nail it.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  The hipsters of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  It's appropriate.  It's the L train.  Fucking losers.  Loser train.  I thought it was for lots of potential.  Well, that's it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or look at all this pussy.  Yeah.  The pussy all over the place.  It's amazing.  Did you find the news story?  I don't know.  What do you mean? 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  All right, hipster.  You're done here.  No.  I can't get it.  Thank you, Sal.  We'll get back to hipsters a little later.  He really is delusional.  He walks in here going, let me tell you about these hipsters around where I live.  Right.  I'm not one of those guys.  Dude, you're one of them.  You're so one of them.  Of course.  It's not even a peripheral like, eh, he's absolutely one of them.  Of course.  He wants to make sure he's cool wherever he's hanging out.  So when he's in Brooklyn, he's like, yeah, I'm a hipster.  And when he's here, he's like, yeah, let me tell you about those hipsters.  Let me tell you about those fucking hipsters. 
[00:31:00]  Ridiculous.  And I bet you he dresses down to come in here.  Of course.  I can only imagine what Sal wears when he's not doing the Open Anthony show.  Oh, I'd have loved to have bumped into him when I was there and seen him in full hipster regalia.  You had to leave his ascot at home today.  Yeah.  His ascot.  His cummerbund and spats.  Yeah.  They just walk around with spats on.  And what is it now?  Like people just trying to outdo each other at this point?  Exactly.  When it used to be just a casual thing where people don't have a lot of money, so they go  to the thrift stores and mix and match and say, fuck it.  They're trying to outdo each other, but no one will acknowledge that somebody is outraged. 
[00:31:30]  They'll never look and go like, dude, where'd you get that?  Well, that's fucking funny or cool.  They'll just look like, hey, man.  Hey, man.  And just accept whatever lunacy.  I mean, the guy could be walking around with a Steve Martin arrow through his head.  Like you used to wear on stage.  Right.  And it'd just be, hey, what's up, man?  Let's go.  Like not even acknowledging that it's ridiculous.  What about a pirate patch?  Right.  Over your eye.  Sure.  And I don't know.  Go old school and go with like parachute pants.  Fucking fantastic. 
[00:32:00]  That'd be good.  Parachute pants.  80s parachute pants.  And a pirate patch over your eye.  I've learned from Anthony.  It's got to be two things.  At least two things.  At least two things.  If you have that 80s nostalgia thrown in, that's double bonus points.  Yeah.  Bonus.  Bonus.  Oh, God.  Do I fucking.  Williamsburg isn't even the cool area anymore.  What?  It's Bushwick now.  Bushwick?  It's true.  My brother.  Wasn't that a fucking high crime area?  It still is.  But now there's a little hipster area.  Oh, God.  I would love to see hipsters just get beaten down by black people.  Bushwick is the hopping place now. 
[00:32:30]  Bushwick Bill, yo.  That's too close to the coloreds.  Oh, boy.  But you know what happened?  Yeah.  Williamsburg became the place that everybody became aware of.  Yeah.  So once, then the hipsters were like, well, this ain't cool anymore.  It's not hip anymore.  They're like, we're actual hipsters.  So now, hey, everybody, let's move over there.  Let's be ironic and move to the black area.  Right.  Even though it's fucking the black area.  Because they've got to live in the spot that people are like, why would you live there?  Right.  Because it's cool.  You don't get it, man.  It's cool.  Dude, you just don't get it.  Oh, Christ.  Let me get my little hat. 
[00:33:00]  I'm going to put my little hat on my head.  Walk around.  And then they come in and be like, there's so much young pussy here.  A lot of young pussy.  Sal.  Oh, is he absolutely one of them?  Sal's just a kid.  You don't get it?  He comes in here, hey, there's a lot of pussy.  Young pussy.  Young pussy.  Young pussy.  I'm sure you're going to be seeing a lot of fucking 70s snorkel jackets.  That would be a good one.  A snorkel jacket.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And fucking.  And wear a baseball glove. 
[00:33:30]  Just walk around with a baseball glove on.  That would be great.  Hey, what's up, man?  How you doing?  And no one even talks about it.  And no one acknowledges that you're wearing a first baseman's glove.  A first baseman's mitt and a fucking snorkel jacket.  Right.  And it's a left-handed glove.  And I'm righty.  That makes it even crazier.  Oh, is that great?  I love the two-thing concept of the hipster.  Oh, it's the hipster thing.  You better repurpose this audio.  It's too good.  Yeah.  Okay.  Got to fucking repurpose. 
[00:34:00]  Anyway, we had a situation last night, and I'm kind of fucking bummed about it because  I probably should have kept it to myself.  Did you blow up the spot, as they say?  I guess.  I didn't mean to, but.  Could that hipster fuck get me another cup of ice?  Don't spit.  You spit in this.  He's not an intern anymore.  He's going to get very annoyed that you just asked him to get you a cup of ice.  Everyone is an intern to me.  Bravo.  Yes.  We're all interns.  Thank you.  Yeah, I feel like you guys are still interns in a way.  We're here to help. 
[00:34:30]  We all kind of start on satellite radio together.  Yeah, we really did.  Hey, eight years.  Fuck.  So we do Jacktober.  Eight years in country.  But any moment, we're going to, you know, not have the show anymore.  Jesus.  Really?  Yeah, these guys out there just hoping that it all ends.  Year after year, they just are wrong.  You know, you guys are flashing the pants.  Fucking flashing the pants.  That's a long flash.  Nobody's going to pay for radio is the bottom line. 
[00:35:00]  That's true.  It's just not going to happen.  You know, this is free.  No one has their fucking birthday, what is it?  Birthday beatings.  Womp.  Womp.  Oh, is it whooping?  Yeah, birthday whoopings.  Birthday whoopings.  And nobody's counting the chewed up gum under the subway seats either.  What a great clip.  You have that clip from yesterday?  Yeah, Eric should love that.  Eric, we probably should have kept that clip close.  It has to do with the...  Obviously, there's an update on that.  What?  Yeah, the news story.  It's in the office.  He'll go get it.  Oh boy, that could take 20 minutes to walk down the hall. 
[00:35:30]  That's true.  I see.  Let's see if he moves.  I want to see if he moves for this.  Let's see.  Like a glacier he moves.  We need the desk.  See what the hustle's like?  We need the desk ASAP because there's an update on it.  Eric has left his post and now he, of course, lumbers down the hall.  Look at him.  Look at his arms.  Look at how he swings his arms.  He's like an ape.  Picking up wind resistance.  He's a fucking ape.  Look at his arms go.  He's the only person you can hear walking down the hall.  And I'm not saying that because he's fat or whatever. 
[00:36:00]  He just walks very hard.  He's like the brontosaurus, the thunder lizard, walking down the hallway.  He just hit the speed of lard.  See, if I was him, I would have ran down the hall and back because then it's less time for us to goof on him.  He doesn't get that.  He doesn't think we'll even bring up the fact that the question still remains.  Are they jelly or jam tits?  Jelly tits.  Jam tits.  Jelly or jam.  This isn't first day appreciate the opportunity, Eric. 
[00:36:30]  I appreciate the opportunity.  I'm so bummed I was gone that day.  Oh, was that a douche chill?  I was having my daughter that day and I heard it was great going back and listening to the audio of the first fucking satellite show.  So douchey.  He goes, I'm just here to do the jobs that nobody else wants to do and I'm happy to do them.  And I'm happy to be here.  Fast forward eight years.  Are you still happy?  Happy to have the opportunity?  Are you thrilled?  Yes.  Fast forward six months and he's at Giant Stadium by himself.  Oh, gee.  At least the concert was good. 
[00:37:00]  Awkward.  What happened?  Someone told me that was the same day he won 100 G's.  Wow, was it?  I mean, thank you, hipster.  So that might have played into the whole thing.  Yeah, the show won 100 G's.  I bought you a cup of ice, but no ice in it, man.  Yeah.  Because I'm sour of the hipster.  I figured my grip would be cool enough for the cup.  Yeah.  It cools down the cup enough, doesn't it?  Because I'm cool.  And by the way, there's a fuckload of pussy with that cup.  Now, who wants a PBR? 
[00:37:30]  PBR, huh?  Now, that is even hip, though.  PBR in a can, no.  That isn't hip anymore.  That's just like Williamsburg.  It's jumped the shark.  Right.  But that was a thing 10 years ago.  Yeah, I was drinking PBR in a can.  I started drinking that cheap beer again about 10 years ago, and I kind of liked it.  That's how you get that.  Brought back memories.  It's like a dollar a can at the bar.  Yeah, get that pussy.  Convince those chicks to give up that pussy.  That pussy.  Ah.  There was a place I used to go to called, I think it's Trailer Park.  It was an actual trailer in Manhattan.  Yeah.  And it had the really old, cheap beer.  Yeah, it was a cool little joint. 
[00:38:00]  That sounds very hipstery.  Well, now it's absolutely hipstery, but back then, it was like 8 to 10 years ago, it was  just what you did.  Yeah.  I don't think the term hipster was actually around yet.  No.  No.  I don't know.  Anyway.  It's actually hipster.  I was surprised watching that episode of Seinfeld, and they used hipster.  Hipster doofus?  Yeah.  They called Kramer a hipster doofus.  They called him a hipster doofus.  I think the term, am I a hipster doofus?  I think the term hipster was around a long fucking time, but it's just this like. 
[00:38:30]  Kind of like this vague thing.  Well, if you remember, there was an episode of The Flintstones, where the guy, I can't  remember his name, but it was that singer, and he was like,  There's a place I know where the hipsters go, called Bitrock.  Twitch, it's a swinging town, I hope to see you down in Bitrock.  Rock Roll.  His name was Rock Roll.  Rock Roll.  And rock is gonna roll.  And rock is gonna roll.  Well, I am to try, and here's the song I'm gonna sing at your show. 
[00:39:00]  It's one I just recorded.  Recorded.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Cowbelly, powder beans, tie a rope around your jeans, tell your mom not to wait, you ain't  getting home till late.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're gonna twitch.  Yeah, here we go.  There's a town I know where the hipsters go.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  Twitch, twitch, when you get an inch, then you do the twitch in Bitrock. 
[00:39:30]  Twitch, twitch, cause the twitch is fine, have yourself a time in Bitrock.  Twitch, twitch.  And then he got sick or something, cause he ate the pickled dodo bird eggs.  And Fred had to dress up like him, and they played the record, but it started skipping.  And rock is gonna roll.  All right.  And then went, rock is gonna roll, and rock is gonna roll, and rock is gonna roll.  And got stuck.  Swing it, town, so I'll see you down.  Yeah, exactly.  Who doesn't remember?  Twitch, twitch.  Yeah, yeah.  Woo!  Ha ha, hipster. 
[00:40:00]  That's wild.  Come on.  Good pick-up.  Good pick-up on that shit.  Shit ruled.  I love the Flintstones.  I still love the Flintstones.  Hard to find, though.  Yeah.  I don't see it on TV.  But I am Rock Quarry.  I am Rock Quarry.  You might remember me in Dr. Jekyll's Hide.  Oh!  Ha ha, ha, ha.  Turning my kid on to old cartoons.  I spent a lot of time watching cartoons with your kid.  I'll just be Gus Schultz.  I want to find the Flintstones. 
[00:40:30]  I turned him on to the Jetsons.  He's into the Jetsons.  It's gotta be the classic Flintstones, though.  No fucking Fred and Barney show.  No, I know.  No fucking Pebbles and Bam Bam.  Old school.  Yeah, early on.  Is it on TV somewhere?  I have a channel called Boomerang that airs all that old stuff.  Boomerang.  Boomerang.  Of course the consumer knows that.  And they're out on DVD.  The cartoon addict.  You have them?  Yeah.  No, I'm not a Flintstones.  Oh, well.  You don't like the Flintstones?  I like them, but I'm not a...  Eric's more of an animaniac.  Oh.  Says the guy with the Jack Skellington Skeletor mashup t-shirt that he's literally wearing. 
[00:41:00]  Not for irony.  Oh, shit.  Anti-hipster.  Yeah, you are.  And you can't have the fake Fred voice.  You are, Eric.  Fake Fred Fred is...  It's done at that point.  Hey, Barney.  Let's go bowling, Barney.  That's not fucking Fred.  Fred is...  We're relating to the 70-year-olds out there.  Well, I think some people might remember.  I hope.  I hope. 
[00:41:30]  I hope he runs.  Anyway, so we did Jacktober yesterday with this show called Mary and Chris in Grand Junction,  Colorado, Magic 93.1.  We had a blast with them.  Then they acknowledged us and did a couple minutes on us.  Oh, boy.  Which was just a mistake on their part.  They weren't happy about it.  No.  No.  They thought they could calm everything down by acknowledging what happened.  That one show in D.C. had it figured out.  You just compliment the show and be like, I'm fans of you guys. 
[00:42:00]  We're honored to be part of Jacktober.  Yeah, and then we went on the air.  And it's over.  And then we went on the air and went, all right.  Right.  Kane show in Washington, D.C.  What the hell?  They're cool.  But, like, going on the air.  We changed our mind quickly around here.  Of course.  But going on the air and doing what they did is the opposite.  And I thought they were trying to have a little fun with it.  But then I realized, well, this is how douchey regular radio is.  They actually mean what they're saying in this clip.  Yeah, they don't even care about the community.  The community.  We were just talking about how we totally don't give a shit about community activism on this show. 
[00:42:30]  Hell fucking no.  We're not helping.  On any day I could watch a homeless guy taking a shit on a sidewalk, why would I give them a fuck about the community?  They don't care about the community.  And if I was in New York in the big city doing radio, I would think of a thing to do like, see what's stuck underneath the seats.  What kind of candy on the subways?  It's like, that's what you would do?  Well, why don't we play this clip because they acknowledged Jack Tober and what our fans did, not us. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, because we didn't encourage them to do it.  No, they just took it upon themselves.  And then we got the update.  And I might have blown it with the update.  I'll explain in a second.  But this is what they said yesterday.  We've heard it all at this point.  I love the, they have nothing better to do. 
[00:43:30]  We've heard the nothing better to do so many times.  It's not that we have nothing better to do.  We just decided this is what we want to do.  And what is there better, what is there that's better to do that we could be doing than ragging on that?  It's called Jack Tober.  This is what we do.  What they're failing to realize is even if we have nothing better to do than this, it's great.  Yes.  There is nothing better to do.  Right.  At this point, we only have one benchmark bit and it's called Jack Tober.  Yeah, leave us alone. 
[00:44:00]  Nothing better to do.  It's awesome.  Of course, there's nothing better to do.  There is literally nothing better to do.  There's so much stuff we could do.  Right.  But it's not better than Jack Tober.  No way.  We choose to do this.  Right.  Yeah.  Big boys.  Brilliant.  They've got nothing better to do this morning, Opie and Anthony, than mess with small market radio.  And what did they do by messing with us this morning, Chris?  That's a good question.  What did we do by messing with this small radio station?  And I have to look down.  Grand Junction, Colorado. 
[00:44:30]  We had a lot of fun.  We did.  We had a lot of laughs.  It was being fun.  Told some jokes.  Told some jokes.  A few jokes.  Entertained our audience.  Yeah.  Goofed around a little bit.  What did we accomplish?  We don't try to accomplish anything.  We just hope that people get to work with maybe a laugh or two.  That's all.  We can fuck about.  That's all.  And maybe even make you think a little bit every once in a while.  Yeah.  That's what we accomplish.  If you think about it, really.  Really.  Radio.  And what did they do by messing with us this morning, Chris? 
[00:45:00]  So they told us to go on our Facebook and talk about our competition and talk about how  we suck and local radio is terrible and terrestrial radio sucks.  But didn't they start in a local group?  Yeah.  So they had people go to our Facebook and post like.  What does that mean?  Didn't they start?  Yeah.  Everyone has to start somewhere.  Yeah.  It didn't exist.  We fucking hated regular radio from day one.  It just got so out of hand to try to do radio on regular radio.  I hated it. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  I was trying to get us syndicated from day one, even though we weren't even close to  ready.  Plus, we're not saying every single regular radio show is terrible.  No.  But that one specifically is.  That one is.  Yeah.  Your show is very bad.  Right.  And it happens to be on regular radio.  It's like she thought she made a brilliant point.  Didn't they start on regular radio?  Didn't they?  Yeah.  Of course we did.  I've investigated this, and I do believe they've started on regular radio.  Ah.  They're sharp.  Regular radio or local radio, I should say. 
[00:46:00]  Because there is a difference.  I didn't mind being on regular radio, actually.  I liked it for a long, long time.  I didn't like being on local radio.  One market.  That sucked.  It always sucked.  You feel like you're just claustrophobic.  You want to branch out.  I remember I was a big radio star on Long Island in Suffolk County, but then as soon as I went  into Nassau County, no one knew who I was.  Guess what?  As a performer, that really sucked.  You cross over fucking 135, and you're like, ah.  Wow. 
[00:46:30]  It stinks.  Yeah.  Who likes that?  I'm a big star east of the Seaford Oyster Bay Expressway.  Who accepts that for their career?  No one.  You want to do well locally, but you have dreams of just continuing to expand, I guess.  Yeah, exactly.  Now we're hurt in Australia, goddammit.  Aye.  It sucks.  But didn't they start in a local?  Yeah, so they had people go to our Facebook and post all kinds of nasty stuff.  Oh, it's awful.  I mean, nasty, nasty stuff.  Terrible photos.  Terrible huffle. 
[00:47:00]  Terrible remarks.  So we have no Facebook page right now, by the way.  Can you believe such a thing?  I just don't understand why you would do that.  I guess that's all they have to do.  I guess so.  Yeah, that's all we have to do.  We have little tiny radio stations like that.  We have all kinds of stuff.  You know, one thing of it is, they don't have astutes to talk about.  I know they're a married couple.  I kind of like the guy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, because you could tell he's like, he's not that bothered by it.  And we were listening to the clips yesterday.  He probably didn't.  He's not into the show.  Huh?  We were listening to the clips yesterday.  He's not into the show. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, they're a married couple.  And you could tell that he's like, you know what?  In the back of his head, he's like, yeah, they're kind of right.  I'm hoping for more for myself.  But then she is fucking pissed.  Oh, yeah.  They don't have astutes.  What's astutes?  I don't know.  It must be one of their bits.  It's one of their bits.  Astutes.  Her thing about, didn't they start in small market radio?  Yeah.  That's like being like, you're in high school, and you're like, elementary school kids are  stupid.  Yeah.  Like, fifth graders are like, well, didn't you start?  Didn't you start in elementary school?  Oh, you got me.  Yeah, but I graduated. 
[00:48:00]  I did better, and then I moved on.  Yeah.  Yeah, we moved on.  Right.  Onward and upward.  Yeah, hopefully.  That's what everyone does.  Yeah.  You move on to something better for yourself.  Didn't you start as a cashier?  Yeah, but now I'm the manager, bitch.  Oh.  That's right.  I started out as a fucking caddy.  That's what I started out.  There you go, caddy.  And now you're just pop, pop, puttin'.  That's it.  Right.  Exactly.  All kinds of stuff.  You know, one thing of it is, they don't have astutes to talk about.  Okay?  They don't have a buzz board.  You know?  Birthday whoopins, obviously, something they don't...  I hate that. 
[00:48:30]  I got to stop it again, just because this is where they blew it.  Because we like to teach the radio shows out there.  Like, they got beat up bad, obviously.  Yeah.  And now they're acknowledging and they're talking about it.  If she did this sarcastically, this 30 seconds, all would have been good.  Right.  But she's not.  And then I wouldn't have asked for an apology.  Everything would have been good between us.  She's actually being like, fuck you guys.  Where's your buzz board?  Buzz board?  Well, why not?  Birthday whoopins? 
[00:49:00]  Ah!  Shit, that scares me.  I swear.  Why not learn from us and be able to goof on yourself?  So if we're making fun of local radio, you should have fun with this instead of listing  all the stuff you do locally.  Terrible.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And goof on a little bit.  Like, all right, maybe this is a little silly.  Like, birthday whoopins is not something you brag about.  No!  Oh, my God.  I was scared.  I thought it was...  Ah!  But here's the laundry list of stuff they do.  And she's dead serious instead of having fun with it.  Talk about, okay, they don't have a buzz board. 
[00:49:30]  You know, birthday whoopins, obviously something they don't do.  Oh, they're satellite guys, you know, so they don't even care about their community or  informing their community.  That's right, people.  And you know what's interesting is compared...  We'll be the first to tell you that.  We're free.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Last time I checked, we don't cost you anything to listen to.  If you listen to them, pay like $14.99 a month.  Fools.  Maybe there's a reason why it's free.  I don't know.  All right.  Say, he's pretty much trying to tell her, will you relax?  Yeah, yeah.  It's one dumb day.  They fucking focused on us. 
[00:50:00]  Let's not take ourselves too seriously and have a little fun with this back.  I don't know if this is worth it.  That was his way.  And she's like, all right, well, you know, let's stay on point.  We're supposed to be mad here.  Exactly.  And a small amount of research would show that the nobody paying for radio thing doesn't  hold water when Paul McCartney had a concert celebrating 20 million subscribers.  Was that for 20 million?  Yeah.  Aren't we up to 24, 25 now?  We're around 25-ish.  25-ish?  Amazing.  Yeah, that's stupid.  What a stupid service that 25 million people are paying for. 
[00:50:30]  Makes no sense.  And then a shitload of people fucking bootlegging.  No, but you can go to their website and stream, so.  That's true.  That's good.  Yeah.  $99 a month.  Maybe there's a reason why it's free.  I don't know.  All right.  So now we've got to, like, we'll tell you about the new Facebook later on when we get  that thing going.  So it's bad right now.  And then, like, the group that we don't even use anymore, all of a sudden we've had, like,  I don't know, 100 people requesting to join the group.  At first I thought, wow, we must have had a very memorable group.  Yes, we'll say that.  Because people want to be a part of it. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  And so there you go with that.  Interesting.  Losers.  Okay.  So.  Well, they don't get to, I mean, do you ever hear, like, you know, one of them,  Sam, never even heard of them.  Do they ever go yard sailing?  Nah.  Nah, she's got to continue.  And she's got to make police she's never heard of us.  Yeah.  I never even heard of them.  Even though this whole thing started with we're being attacked by the big boys today.  Never heard of them.  Do they go yard sailing?  Do you?  I don't think so.  You know why?  What is that?  Hopey and Anthony don't go yard sailing. 
[00:51:30]  Why?  Because they've been in radio long enough that they're millionaires and they don't have  to buy things at yard sales.  Right, I just buy things.  Sam.  And then throw them away.  Multi.  Multi.  Jesus.  Millionaires.  My God.  You go shop at Grand Junction yard sales while these gentlemen go to Bloomy's.  Exactly.  Bloomingdale's.  One of them.  See, I've never even heard of them.  Do they ever go yard sailing?  Nah.  Do you even find yard sales?  Where do they live?  Where are they at?  New York.  Oh, okay.  Now, see, that's how foolish they are.  If I had that show, I would be like, so you're going to go get on the subway and see how many 
[00:52:00]  different pieces of chewed candy and gum you could find under the seats?  That would be entertaining, wouldn't it?  Yeah.  Wouldn't hurt anybody's feelings.  I feel a little excited this morning.  Wouldn't hurt anybody's feelings.  If their listeners really care about small market radio, that's amazing.  Yeah.  Oh, so there you go.  So no Facebook for a while.  Okay.  Who's on Twitter?  That's probably on a hack, too.  He was hoping, by the way.  Do we have a YouTube still?  Who knows what's going on?  Do we have a MySpace?  Hey, at least we've got a lot more users there.  There you go.  Magic. 
[00:52:30]  Magic.  The guy's not as pissed off as she is.  No.  That, to her, is a great bit.  It's something that doesn't hurt anyone.  Right.  And it's just interesting.  What's underneath the seats on a subway?  A fucking used condom and a hypo needle that I hope you fucking reach under the seat and  get pricked with, you fucking dummy.  And that's the reason why Jocktober will continue.  Yes.  Of course.  Because she really thought that would be a good bit.  She's thinking that whoever guesses closest, they'll get like a $25 TJ Maxx card.  Well, here's a couple of things.  I love TJ Maxx.  They wrote a little blog on us yesterday. 
[00:53:00]  Do we have that still?  Yeah.  And I don't know, I think.  And then, and I swear I didn't read it.  I'm not just saying that because they said that.  I really, I didn't read it.  I figured we'd read it cold on the show today.  Nice.  But then, the local news in Grand, I have to look again.  Grand Junction.  Grand Junction, Colorado.  You know the place because you've been there.  Oh, yeah.  They did a whole fucking piece on this.  Wow.  There was big news in old Grand Junction, huh?  Yeah, the news guy.  Right.  And Opie and Anthony attacked a local radio station today as part of something called Jocktober. 
[00:53:30]  Jocktober.  And someone brought it to my attention last night, and then I fucking blew it.  I tweeted this guy, I retweeted this guy's tweet, and then our fans decided, well, why not leave some comments on the story?  Oh, no.  And they left comments on the story.  Yeah.  And this news channel took the whole fucking piece off their website. 
[00:54:00]  Took the story down.  Because the whole piece was how we hacked their Facebook page.  Yeah.  So then our listeners decided to hack their comments.  Oh, man.  Well, that would have been good.  Fuck.  Rich Voss is checking in.  What?  Hey, Rich, what's up, buddy?  Hey, I almost had to go on.  First of all, I'm calling from the grave because I heard I died yesterday.  Poor Rich got run over by a tractor-trailer. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, man.  I didn't realize that you were into biking, man.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  Every time I come into studio, part of me on the inside dies.  So it's just...  You know, I'm almost...  I almost didn't get into radio.  I'm in Providence, Rhode Island, doing the connection this weekend.  Nice.  I almost didn't get into radio because that's who you guys did last week on Jocktober.  Oh, no.  Wait, who did we do last week?  I don't know.  Pro-FM or something.  Did we?  And when I went into studio before, they said anything. 
[00:55:00]  I'm going, this is the exact type of place that you guys would do Jocktober.  Oh, no.  Wait, you were on this show?  What, that?  Did you make it on the show?  Yeah, but they were talking about it off the air.  They go, we love those guys, but they're fans.  They destroyed our...  So, really?  Well, they did the same to me two weeks ago.  Yeah, that's true.  They got a little... 
[00:55:30]  They were chomping at the bit, so they fucking attacked Rich's Facebook page.  You know, and...  If I was to break it down, I don't give a fuck about these radio shows.  It's just fun.  It's just fun.  It's just fun, because there's a lot of weird, different radio out there that we absolutely  don't want to do and never wanted to do, so we showcase it.  In the end, I hate to pull down a fucking...  They're just doing their dumb job.  ...wall today, but in the end, I don't mean any real harm. 
[00:56:00]  It's just fucking fun for a month.  Because I know these guys are trying to fucking...  Just doing their job.  Make a living.  The guy who's been there for 1,200 years, he was there when he had two listeners.  Listen, I went into their state.  It's different.  Radio around the country, you know, I was in there for one break, and I had to do my act,  and they said, so, what do you want me to lead into?  Oh, God.  You know, and it's just how they do things.  You know, it's not like coming into your...  People, comics don't realize when you go on your show, that's real radio. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Because you guys really don't care.  You know, if a comic came into your radio station and lit himself on fire, you would go,  that's good radio.  Yeah, exactly.  Especially if it was you, Rich.  Right.  I know.  Well, I'll tell you, I'll break something else down for you.  When me and Anthony started together, and actually even when I was doing radio before Anthony,  I fucking hated comics on the radio.  I fucking hated them.  Brewer was an exception. 
[00:57:00]  He did my show way back at BAB.  But most of them I fucking hated because they would come in, and they would want to set up  so they could do five minutes of material, and I'm like, wait a minute.  If you're a comic, you've got to be a funny person in general.  Why can't you just hang out and be funny?  And then when we were in Boston, they were trying to get all those comics on our show,  if you remember.  Oh, yeah.  And we said no to all of them.  Every once in a while, we'd have one on, like a John Valby or something.  And we couldn't stand it.  And then when we moved to New York, we decided to give it another chance because there were 
[00:57:30]  so many stand-up comics in New York City.  And then that's finally when we turned the corner and just had all you guys on because,  you know.  To just hang out and talk.  Yeah.  Yeah, not do the act.  Nobody wants to do the act.  I was doing, before you guys, when I did another radio show in New York, it was Perino, right?  You know, until he was sitting at the bar and going, yeah, you're hot.  I'm going, oh, now I know why he's putting me on.  Wait, did he really hit on you? 
[00:58:00]  No, no.  What he said was, I was sitting at the bar at Caroline's with him, and some guy walks  by, like a Marine, and he goes, damn, look how hot he is.  Oh, geez.  Yeah, but he was doing that to get to you.  But I didn't know he was gay.  The feeler's out.  I'm going, no wonder this guy's always having me on.  It's so, you know, I got all creeped out.  You know, I mean, I hear what I had to do to get back on, but.  You might have heard the stories of you and your tiny little jean shorts.  He was waiting for you to say, yeah, he is hot, and then he could have made the move.  He's brilliant. 
[00:58:30]  It's too bad you weren't on drugs when you ran to Mark Perino.  You both would have got what you wanted.  Yeah.  I would have had some Perino on my back.  By the way, for the record, I have no problems with Mark Perino.  We're long past that one as well.  Neither do I.  We used to have massive battles with that guy.  Oh, you did?  So, anyhow.  Well, because he was the big dog in Boston, and we said, fuck that.  And we went right after the big dog, and we kicked his ass.  We used to call him Mark Riorento.  We did.  We did. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  We did.  You stupid fucking play on word hack.  Exactly.  But it was funny back then, Rich.  I know.  That's what Bonnie called.  We went to see the cheap book release party.  And, you know, Bonnie called DeRosa Cecil DeMille's.  So, she still be, you know, a movie maker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you say that right?  Who fucked that up?  I don't know who fucked it up.  All right, all right.  I'll let it go. 
[00:59:30]  Fuck it.  She still be at DeMille's.  Get it?  The joke.  Anyhow, play on words.  I was just trying to do your type of comedy.  I'm failing miserably.  Do we do play on words comedy?  Not really.  I don't think so.  What, Rich?  So, I'm doing a parental show.  And, you know, I'm doing my bits.  Then I'm doing a set at the cellar.  And someone yells out, I heard that before.  I heard that on radio.  I go, yeah, you fucking idiot.  It was me yesterday.  That's who you heard.  That's why you don't want to do your dumb bits on radio.  Because then you go into the club. 
[01:00:00]  And they go, oh, we know the punchline that's coming.  So, there's a couple of comics you can do.  Like, Regan can get away with it because he's so funny.  Yeah, you know what?  He is probably the only guy that we allow to just do his bits.  Although, when he's not doing bits and hangs, he's good, too.  I remember when you guys called Jenny out.  And you go, is that a bit?  Oh, God.  It was so uncomfortable.  Yeah, apparently too uncomfortable for him. 
[01:00:30]  Oof.  For who?  Richard Jenny.  Oh, what are you going to do?  Yeah, pass it.  Where are you?  His last words.  His last words were, fuck 0 and 8.  Oh, I sure hope not.  Oh, man, come on.  What?  Don't blame me.  It's creepy.  Anyhow, well, listen.  I've got to go.  I'm going to do one of those morning TV shows with the black guy, the Asian girl, and the white guy.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Where's that?  That's strange. 
[01:01:00]  We're in Providence, Rhode Island.  It's every fucking, oh, wait, what's that?  You found it?  Oh, you found it.  Nice.  All right, we got to go.  We're back on this Jack-tober.  Nice.  Hey, Rich, you all right?  Because you wrote me yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  No, I just wanted to talk to you about two things.  November 10th, where we're premiering the show and the movie.  Yeah, we're going to be in Los Angeles on the 10th.  Is Okie going to be there, too?  Yes.  Yeah.  Can you move that?  We might be doing a TV thing. 
[01:01:30]  We're still trying to figure it out.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Yeah.  We're bringing it up a notch.  Yeah.  After all these years.  What would you do?  That's what I say now.  You know what?  Rich, I want to beat you up for that, but that was good.  That was a good fucking slot for you.  It was okay.  Thank you.  Rich was on ABC's What Would You Do?  Yeah, yeah.  So.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, listen.  So you've got to move that November 10th thing if you can, because I want to be there  for you.  It's the New York Comedy Festival.  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  You know?  Ken, sorry.  Opie's doing some hitting camera show or something or whatever.  How do you?  Well, what kind of are you, asshole?  Jesus.  What?  Oh, really?  I didn't.  You dick.  You don't make fun of your stand-up, you dick.  Oh, really?  You don't make fun?  We don't make fun of.  No, we don't make fun of your stand-up.  No, we actually do.  That's our line.  We'll make fun of everything you say on this radio show, but I've never made fun of your  act because you're hilarious.  And I never make fun of. 
[01:02:30]  I go.  So don't make fun of our opportunity that it might be some kind of candid camera show.  Well, I hope it is, and I hope you're hosting it, because then I have to look forward  to.  I don't know.  We're still in talks.  We'll see what happens.  All right, Rich.  Oh, sorry.  I hope I didn't steal any beans.  I just guessed that.  No, it's all good.  All right.  Well, listen, thanks.  Come to the Connection, and come to the Caroline November 10th.  All right.  Please talk.  Bye.  All right.  Rich Voss at the Comedy Connection in Providence, Rhode Island, right?  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss. 
[01:03:00]  Rich Voss.  Thanks, everybody.  Anyway, where were we?  He kind of took the steam out of the whole fucking night.  We were doing, we were talking about Jacktober yesterday when we were featuring that show  from Grand Junction, and they acknowledged it on their program, called us, you know, idiots  and whatnot, and crowed about what they do.  And then apparently the local news station picked it up in Grand Junction and did a little  story on how we fucked up their show.  You want to play that?  Yes.  Nothing more than to play it. 
[01:03:30]  Full credit for finding the original story buried somewhere on the internet to Random  Rigor on Twitter.  Nice.  Thank you, sir.  That's what?  Nandum what?  I said Random Rigor.  Oh, that's different then.  Yes.  Because what happened was the local news does a story on it, and then there's a comment  section, and then our listeners found the comment section, and it got brutal so bad  that they pulled the story from their website, right?  Yeah, including one from Edgar that simply says, my teeth are dry. 
[01:04:00]  All right, let's see what this is all about, how they report.  This is great.  Okay.  Buffering.  I was buffering on my phone all day yesterday, too.  For DJs, this month is known as Jocktober.  Wait, wait, what did he say?  For DJs, this month is known as Jocktober.  For DJs?  No, not for DJs, you idiot.  For DJs, it's known as Rocktober.  Rocktober, which we hate.  That's why we started Jocktober.  We call it Jocktober, because it's a goof on Rocktober, which all the hacky jocks do. 
[01:04:30]  We're the only fucking show doing Jocktober.  Jocks don't do Jocktober.  Jocks do Rocktober.  We do Jocktober.  That's right.  Unless all the shows have become aware of it, and they fear Jocktober every month.  They fear Jocktober.  Fair enough.  But, of course, what a surprise.  A local news douche getting something wrong.  Getting it completely wrong.  Right.  Oh, it's buffering again.  What's wrong with this site?  Jiminy Cricket.  It's really bad.  For DJs, this month is known as Jocktober. 
[01:05:00]  Wrong.  It comes with the fear that a prank may be played against their station.  XM Radio personalities Opie and Anthony started this celebration in 2008.  The purpose, to prank, quote, bad radio shows.  Today, the victim was here on the Western Slope.  93.1 was hacked, and they were made fun of for their local content.  It doesn't help if you're a local radio show that the news guy says they focus on bad radio.  And then they say you're calling. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, the radio wizard at that radio station can't be happy.  He's not happy.  I'm backing up slightly.  I'm sorry.  I'll try to shut my fucking mouth up.  That's hilarious.  He could have said anything.  He could have said local shows.  He could have said small market.  Right.  It's bad.  It's buffering.  Yeah.  It's got the twirly thing in the middle of the screen there.  It's for their local content.  I guess we were happy to be selected as the worst radio in Western Colorado.  You know, we always suspected it, and it's nice to have confirmation. 
[01:06:00]  We know it now.  We're craptastic.  We are.  Yeah, if you got any of those messages, we're sorry.  I mean, the content was just crazy inappropriate from those people that put stuff on there.  We'll get a new Facebook page, get it back up in the next week or so,  and we'll have a few more restrictions on it, I guess, this time.  This morning, racy content was posted all over the radio station's Facebook page,  causing them to lose 1,000 fans within minutes.  Hopi and Anthony pick a new station to prank each day during the month of October. 
[01:06:30]  And they go to our Wikipedia page.  Come on.  God, that's horrible local news.  That's hilarious, man.  Fuck, they had to feature it on their dumb little news show.  Love it.  I remember those days.  The local news showed up.  Oh, boy, when you talked to all of them.  Oh, yeah.  Come on in.  Oh, come on in.  Hey, we're going to be on the news today.  Right.  Make sure we look good.  Get the calls in the back behind us.  Someone tweeted yesterday.  He goes, I love you and all, but, which means he doesn't love us at all. 
[01:07:00]  But.  So stop with that shit.  Yeah.  Been around way too long to know what that is.  But.  He goes, but when was the last time you guys got positive press?  Oh.  We're not that type of show.  No.  What the fuck are we supposed to do?  When was the last time anyone got positive press?  Did we ever have positive press?  No one gets press anymore on the radio.  There's not positive.  There is no such thing as positive press.  No.  But have we ever?  I don't even know.  For what?  Jesus.  Was there.  Did we ever do anything charitable? 
[01:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We've done a lot.  Oh, E-Rock is ready on the way.  Positive press.  E-Rock knows everything.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Let's keep it that way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do positive things every day.  I don't need to talk about it or have the news fucking feature it.  Fuck it.  Are we done for now?  Yeah.  By the way, we will feature a brand new station today.  This October has legs now.  It really does. 
[01:08:00]  Now there's the local news stations.  Oh, it's fantastic.  It really is fantastic.  Those two are probably like, oh, well, you know, it wasn't great what happened today,  but there is always a silver lining.  Nice to get a little press.  Yes.  Taking lemons and making lemonade.  She said, we're craptastic.  And she gives the thumbs up.  She's on camera all uncomfortable.  Didn't she just look uncomfortable?  Remember those days?  Yes.  You don't know what to do with yourself in front of the camera.  And you know it's going to be a bad piece, but you want to be on TV, so you're like, 
[01:08:30]  fuck it, I'll do it.  You just want to be on TV.  Look at the two of them.  They're sitting next to each other like, oh.  You know how they said yesterday, you know, didn't they start a local radio?  We have sat in those exact seats.  Yes.  Look at all uncomfortable.  Oh, all uncomfortable.  Trying to get your one funny sound bite in.  I don't care that they're trashing us.  We're on TV.  This is great.  We're on TV.  This is a positive.  We're taking a negative and turning it into a positive.  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.  They'd sit us.  They'd be like, could you guys move closer together? 
[01:09:00]  That's good.  We need to get the microphone in the picture, but not like you're using it, but just in  the picture.  We need some B-roll of your meters on your board.  You don't have 18 hours of that somewhere in your studio?  Oh, God.  They get that B-roll every time.  And the meter's going, dook, dook, dook, dook, dook, dook.  Well, we'll take a break.  We're going to feature another show for Jocktober.  We got Mitt Romney and Obama telling jokes.  Hilarious.  I think Romney came off very, I said, a Reagan-esque at this thing. 
[01:09:30]  Wow.  He was funny.  His delivery was pretty good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Obama messed up his Clint Eastwood joke, but then his joke about his middle name was  pretty funny.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I don't know.  And I tweeted it late last night.  I Instagrammed it, actually.  OP Radio on Instagram.  Instagram.  I brought in the worst baby gift that I received.  That's the dumbest baby gift.  A lot of people have been very nice, very generous.  I've seen that. 
[01:10:00]  Which we really appreciate.  A lot of nice cards and flowers and all sorts of stuff.  Flowers.  And I decided to bring in the worst baby gift.  And I swear to you, this was given to me as a baby gift.  Can you tell us who gave it to you?  Yeah, I'll have all the details next.  Yes.  Of course I will.  I didn't even know this existed.  Uh-huh.  It should be our mystery.  The Opie and Anthony mystery.  Oh.  What am I holding in my hand?  What are you holding in your hand? 
[01:10:30]  Don't go to his Twitter.  Well, we need fucking bits.  That's true.  We need benchmarks.  Let's do the Opie and Anthony mystery next.  The whooping mystery.  Did you say whooping?  Oh.  The whooping mystery.  Gets me every time.  You ever whip a girl?  Uh, no.  Oh, B.  Not whip.  That's not what we're talking about.  Yeah.  Just wondering.  People whip girls.  Ah!  I feel like in Boogie Nights when the firecrackers are going off. 
[01:11:00]  I'm just sitting on the couch.  We're just trying to do the whooping mystery.  All right.  We'll, uh, we'll break and certainly entertain you fucks next.  Stay there.

The show where nationally known comedians meet our panel and try to decide, should I suck a dick or not? 
[01:12:30]  Today's guest, Joe DeRosa.  I do a bit about this, about like the stair step up to it.  It's like, it's not as easy as would you just swallow the cum.  There are many levels of things you need to get through first.  I might be f***ing all in.  I might want to go all the way.  Here's the thing.  Now, what would you do with the dick?  That's the thing I don't know.  That's what he hasn't really answered.  I wouldn't be into swallowing any jizz, but that's the thing.  Why are you making these rules?  Because it makes it more interesting.  Wow, it looks like Joe DeRosa is going to suck dick. 
[01:13:00]  That's all the time we have this week.  Tune in next time when Ricky Gervais tries to decide.  That's not only a dick, that's the biggest dick in the world.  Should I suck a dick or not?  Sirius XM, Sirius XM.  Yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:13:30]  This sounds like a rejoiner.  Keep on!  Sounds like a rejoiner.  Thank you.  I do like it.  Yeah, I love this song.  Ah, there it is.  Nice.  It's Friday.  Let this play a little bit. 
[01:14:00]  Nice.  That is some good shit, man.  We're looking at Shaq on Fox & Friends.  He's promoting the Soup Man Soup.  And they call it Soup Man, but it's the Soup Nazi.  It's the Soup Nazi.  It's the Soup Nazi is selling his soup.  Who's a complete asshole, by the way.  Right.  And I know that's no surprise, but when you actually go from the character to the real guy... 
[01:14:30]  Wait, how am I trying to explain this?  Well, he came to us.  Yeah.  And he wanted us to help him get his soup off the ground.  Right.  How long does this go back?  The first year of satellite radio, maybe?  It was a K-Rock, I think.  It was a K-Rock, right?  His aunt used to get turkey chili for breakfast.  Until they just started bringing pea soup.  Well, that's the point I'm going to make.  This guy wants his help to help him get his stupid soup off the ground.  Everyone knows he's an asshole because it's all based on the Seinfeld thing, but the guy is a real guy. 
[01:15:00]  And so the sales department did the right thing.  They're like, well, you know, bring soup in for the guys every day.  They'll eat your soup and they'll talk about it.  And at the beginning, they did, and it was really good.  Absolutely.  The turkey chili was amazing.  Oh, my God.  I'm not going to trash his soup because he's an asshole, but the turkey chili was amazing.  And then go ahead, Ann.  I'm sorry.  I jumped on what you were going to say.  No, no.  It's true.  It was great until the next couple of weeks. 
[01:15:30]  The soup started...  The quality...  Not the quality.  The type of soup just started going downhill.  I hate...  It was what was not selling.  Right.  Whatever wasn't selling, they would send over to us.  He would only...  Yeah, send that.  So it was like pea soup and...  And the shittier soups.  Crap.  Like the niche.  The niche soup.  Yes.  That, of course, isn't going to be a big seller.  It's terrible.  But he didn't want to give up his turkey chili anymore.  No.  Fucker.  And he wouldn't do the show, either.  And he wouldn't do the show.  Yeah.  And, you know, a lot of these soup places ended up closing down. 
[01:16:00]  And now it looks like he's trying to come back with Shaq helping him out.  Well, they're doing it in a supermarket now.  So they have packets of this soup, I guess, that they're trying to sell in the supermarkets  as opposed to shops and little places that you can go into.  Well, that's good, because then you don't have to deal with this asshole.  Then you don't have to deal with the fucking soup nuts you got.  No, it's fun.  It's the soup nuts.  And he treats you like shit.  Oh, isn't that great?  And if you do anything wrong, they kick you out of the store.  We love it.  We come here every day.  Come back one year.  One year.  Fuck that. 
[01:16:30]  The episode was hilarious.  What's the place in Chicago where the service is purposely bad?  Don't you love that?  I fucking hate all those joints.  Was that the hot dog place?  No.  That Nolan wanted to go to?  Was it?  Wienerville, I think.  Wienerville?  No, I don't think it was Wienerville.  Somebody in Chicago will help us out.  Wiener Circle.  Wiener Circle.  Was it?  Okay.  And you go there, and they purposely treat you like shit.  And then what?  Can you treat them like shit and not give them a tip at the end?  Of course not.  Why not? 
[01:17:00]  Because it's part of the whole fucking gag.  It's part of the experience?  Oh, it's part of the experience.  Come on now.  Where they walk up to your table.  All right.  What do you want?  Everyone chuckles.  And then you order soup, and they kind of slide it towards you where it gets a bit sloppy.  Look, we're being treated like shit.  Oh, isn't this great?  This is so much fun.  Boy, I hope they sell t-shirts.  I want a, they treated me like shit t-shirts.  I paid money to get shit on shirt.  I hate those places.  Yeah.  Fucking hate it. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, I don't want to fucking be treated like crap if I'm fucking paying you.  Of course.  Tap it.  It's not fun.  No.  There's nothing fun about it.  Not at all.  Anyway, soup, Shaq, soup man.  I guess Shaq's pitching for the soup.  Oh, yeah.  The worst baby gift ever.  Oh.  What the fuck is that?  So I got home yesterday, and my wife's like, blank.  Her name will be blank. 
[01:18:00]  Our cleaning lady.  Oh, okay.  Okay, she goes, hey, I got a gift from blank.  I go, oh, that's nice of her.  And it is nice that she thought of us.  Mm-hmm.  And I go, what'd she give us?  And she showed me, and I had to bring it in today.  It's toasted bread in a bag.  It's a bag of toast.  She gave you a bag of toast.  Now, I've been poor still most of my life.  I'm poor. 
[01:18:30]  Done very well.  I'm poor.  Last decade or so.  Sure.  But when you really add up the years, I've been poor most of my life still.  More than not.  More than not.  Yeah.  And times got bad.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of macaroni and cheese over the years.  Mac and cheese.  And trees.  On a hot plate.  That type of shit.  A lot of pasta, because it was cheap.  Uh-huh.  Fucking Pepperidge Farm day-old bread.  Pepperidge Farm remembers what crappy bread tastes like.  Hey, Pepperidge Farm bread. 
[01:19:00]  Margarine and sugar sandwiches.  That is true.  I've been there for more years than not.  I've never seen fucking toast in a bag before.  I didn't even know this existed.  And for some reason, I guess she said this is her favorite thing, so she wanted to kind  to share one of her favorite things with us.  One of her favorite things is...  A few of my favorite things.  Toast in a bag.  What the fuck is toast in a bag? 
[01:19:30]  I stared at this bag, and my brother-in-law is up visiting.  He can back me up.  I stared at this bag for at least 20 minutes yesterday.  I couldn't wrap my head around it.  Trying to figure out.  I don't get it.  I don't either.  You should get your cleaning lady a toaster and blow her fucking world.  Yeah, but I even said last night, when we were just all sitting around talking, I'm  like, even when I was extremely poor, I always had a toaster.  And dude, that is such a Pillsbury knockoff.  Of course it is.  It looks like the Pillsbury Doughboy on there, but it's a bear with a cook hat on, a white, 
[01:20:00]  like a polar bear baby cartoony thing.  You can poke its belly.  Definitely poke the belly.  And the colors on the package and the font and everything is all...  Yeah.  And the problem is, I'm handling this bag very carefully.  I really have been.  Gingerly.  And it's just crumbling inside.  That is a crummy gift, both literally and figuratively.  The company's called Bimbo.  Bimbo.  B-I-M-B-O. 
[01:20:30]  So when I tweeted this picture on my Instagram last night, that's why I love doing what we  do, because you learn.  So many people said Bimbo is a company that sells to, I guess, Mexicans.  Oh, really?  It's a Mexican company.  I did not know this.  That's the Mexican Pillsbury.  Yeah.  So I'm looking at the toasted bread.  The bread born toasted is their slogan by the company Bimbo.  It's a new product, Anthony.  Oh, it's a new product.  It's new.  It's new.  Toast.  It's original. 
[01:21:00]  I don't know if you could claim originality on toast, but they are.  I invented toast.  Before toast.  Bimbo toast.  That was me.  Hoo-hoo.  What else can I say about this?  There's a serving suggestion.  Put on plate.  Eat.  No, the serving suggestion is peanut butter and jelly on top of your...  Jelly or jam?  Toasted bread.  B-rock comment.  It looks like jelly in this case.  Oh.  There's 14 slices per package. 
[01:21:30]  And the expiration date is December 12th.  What kind of bread are they using that it's going to survive until December 12th?  December?  Wow.  She just got it.  So they're basically saying you could have this laying around your house for two months  before you got to throw it away.  And they say caution.  It's a big caution thing at the bottom here.  It says caution.  What could be dangerous about toast?  Ready?  Yeah.  Do not microwave.  Why not?  Why? 
[01:22:00]  Well, we're going to find out because I think I got my viral video.  I'm going to fucking toast.  I'm going to microwave the toasted bread.  What could possibly...  It says...  Wait, wait.  Read that exactly how it's written.  It says, like, caution.  What does it say?  Caution.  Do not microwave.  Caution.  Do we have a microwave here?  Yeah.  What could be dangerous about microwaving toast?  I bet it catches on fire real quick.  Yeah, there's no moisture.  Let's do this.  There's no moisture whatsoever left. 
[01:22:30]  Is that...  Yeah?  You think it starts on fire?  It's like microwaving paper.  Well, I don't think that would do anything, would it?  No.  E-Rock, you're like...  You are America.  You are...  He's the consumer.  Have you ever heard of toasted bread in a bag?  I saw it a couple months ago.  They have a huge display of it.  Like, it's the best thing ever at some supermarkets.  It's...  Nobody buys it.  It's never empty.  Is it down on that bottom Mexican shelf in the fucking supermarket?  You know how all the Mexican shit's down at the bottom shelf? 
[01:23:00]  Those Goya beans?  The big fucking...  Like, the sack that you see over a burrow's fucking back of beans?  Pre-cut pitas?  Yeah.  And that fucking Goya juice shit?  They don't get good placement on the...  Horrible placement.  Every bit of it is by your wheels.  When you're fucking wheeling down the aisle.  I'm not trashing this lady.  Because we do love her.  Well...  But I had to bring it in.  Good cleaning lady.  Horrible gift giver. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, terrible gifts.  I had to bring it in.  Bimbo bread.  I don't really understand this.  Are you going to microwave it here?  What does bimbo mean in fucking Spanish?  Does it mean anything?  Toasted bread.  Is it?  No.  I doubt it.  Anything?  No.  G?  G?  What does it mean?  Type it in.  You're half fucking Mexican or something, aren't you?  Half black, half Mexican?  What are you?  It doesn't mean anything.  Serving size.  It means nothing.  Nothing.  It apparently means eat my ass.  Either that or she's just telling me to eat my ass. 
[01:24:00]  Ready for this?  Yeah, why?  The serving size, one slice is a serving.  Oh.  One piece of toast.  I'm full.  Well, fucking call me full.  I've had a slice of toast.  Don't microwave.  No.  And the percentages of daily value, there's a lot of zeros.  It's just...  Yeah, that could be nothing.  There's a lot of nothing here.  So, I had to share this, so I don't know what else to do with it. 
[01:24:30]  What are we doing in the microwave?  Bimbo owns Wonder Bread.  Yeah, they also own Thomas' English Muffins.  What?  Bimbo?  Yeah.  No way.  They do not own English Muffins.  No.  It's the same company.  They do not.  Arnold's Bread and Thomas' English Muffins are owned by Bimbo?  Mm-hmm.  Or, you know, the same company owns Bimbo and Thomas' English Muffins.  All right, look, look.  That's a big difference.  And Arnold's Bread.  The same company that owns Bimbo owns Thomas' English Muffins.  You're not saying Bimbo owns Thomas' English Muffins. 
[01:25:00]  Not necessarily.  It's just under the same corporate umbrella.  Yeah, correct.  Stop it.  Is there a bag tie on it?  Big controversy.  I don't know.  People are asking.  They also make Entenmann's Cakes and Sara Lee.  No, they don't.  It's under the same corporate umbrella.  Yes.  Are you going to put it in a microwave here?  Yeah, we can.  I hope so.  Do we have a microwave we can bring in the studio?  No, but Obi can get on the phone.  What do you mean, no?  I'm not getting on a phone.  What is this?  Fucking Jacktober?  Yeah, what do you?  Ah, turd!  Turd!  He's putting the toast in the microwave! 
[01:25:30]  Turd!  Tell us what's happening, turd!  We can send Sal down to unplug the microwave in the kitchen and walk it in here.  That's what I'm saying.  Let's bring a microwave in here.  Who cares?  It's still early.  Sal might start using it as a wallet.  That's true.  You know, to just be ironic.  Somebody said another hipster thing that's pretty funny.  Wait, can I?  I got to set it up for people.  Yeah, yeah.  Anthony came up with something that was really fucking funny.  To be a hipster, you got to have like two things, at least two things on you that don't  make sense.  That don't make any sense.  And that's kind of hipster.  One guy said, wearing 3D glasses and a white blind man's cane and just walk around. 
[01:26:00]  That would be such a great board game.  The hipster game.  The hipster game.  We try to figure out the two things that are the most outrageous.  Stupid hipsters.  What about if you like carried a tennis racket and had an army helmet on?  That's pretty good.  That's good.  And you just spin the racket around your hand with a wristband on.  All right, sir.  Good.  And no one, none of your buddies, your cool hipster buds, acknowledge that you're doing  anything odd.  Right. 
[01:26:30]  They see you like that and just go like any other day, hey, how you doing?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, let's go do what hipsters do.  Yeah.  Which is, I don't know, but.  They're pronouncing it wrong.  Now, now, what do you mean?  What?  It spells bimbo.  How the fuck do I?  How do you pronounce bimbo wrong?  Yeah.  How do you pronounce it wrong if it's spelled bimbo?  I'm American.  God damn it.  Sierra.  Sierra.  Hi.  Hi.  It's pronounced bimbo.  And there's a whole commercial.  You should play the theme song.  It's ridiculous.  There's a commercial? 
[01:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  Bimbo.  Bimbo.  But it's spelled bimbo.  But they say it like, hey, this is a bimbo.  Oh, everyone say it's bimbo.  I'm sorry.  I've never heard of this company before.  And don't spell it like bimbo.  Wait, does bimbo make Nutella chocolate?  Do they?  I don't know.  Jamie from Puerto Rico checking in.  He's a regular.  He would know.  I don't like that Nutella shit.  I tried it.  Not a fan.  Not a fan.  Yeah.  Not a fan.  But I do like that chocolate stuff you fucking pour on ice cream and it makes a chocolate shell. 
[01:27:30]  The shell.  How the fuck did they figure that out?  That's got to be some evil chemicals.  That's like fucking Carvel used to do that.  You'd get the cone and then they'd put the chocolate shit on it and it would crack.  It's amazing, though.  How does it fucking do that?  I know the ice cream is cold.  I get it.  But they called it chocolate bonnet and a cherry bonnet.  I remember the cherry bonnet.  Could I have a cherry bonnet?  And it was like ice cream cone with that cherry chocolate shit on it.  We just saw it from afar growing up. 
[01:28:00]  Oh.  We were too poor to go to Carvel.  Did you have a knockoff?  Like, we just buy some generic cones and bad ice cream.  We had knockoffs.  Did you have ice milk?  You'd buy ice milk and put it in a fucking knockoff cone.  It's just like Carvel.  I used to, um...  We used to get Friendly's ice cream.  Oh, boy.  My mom would get a half gallon of maple walnut for herself and then everyone else had a share.  Maple walnut ice cream stinks! 
[01:28:30]  I wouldn't even steal that as a kid if my mom had it.  My mom made it.  Hey, when mom bought shit that you couldn't get.  Like coffee soda.  Well, my mom always made it about herself.  Like, we had a big family, so we had to get two half gallons from Friendly's.  Holy shit.  And it was always maple walnut and then another half gallon for everybody else.  Always.  Like, always.  Oh, man.  That sucks.  So then I got a...  I took to liking maple walnut because it was either that or not have ice cream.  And then I would pour...  It's terrible.  I would pour our powdered milk because we didn't have whole milk. 
[01:29:00]  People don't understand.  It's terrible.  I swear to you, I've been poor way more than I've been rich.  That's why it's so fucking weird to me.  We used to have powdered milk.  And then my mom finally budged and said, all right, we'll mix the powdered milk with whole milk.  So it's half and half.  Oh.  That made it a little better.  A little bit.  But then we would sneak the whole milk when she wasn't looking.  It's supposed to be used...  And then I would pour that over my ice cream. 
[01:29:30]  Just as an additive.  Yeah, I didn't pour the powdered milk over.  But I would pour the whole milk over my ice cream when we did have it.  And then that shit would freeze up nice.  Yeah.  And add a little something to your ice cream.  A little body to it.  I don't know.  Nothing worse than a knockoff of something you love when your parents would just tell you  it's just as good and it never was just as good.  Nothing beat fucking Carvel.  Fucking nice, big, large cone with some sprinkles on it.  Carvel ice cream was just the creamiest shit.  It was great.  You like creamy ice cream? 
[01:30:00]  I love a good creamy soft serve.  Oh, it's great.  I'm not a fan of the soft serve for the most part.  Oh, Mr. Softy Truck would come around?  Yeah.  Oh, you'd fucking sit...  You'd walk behind the Mr. Softy Truck?  Are you being a hipster or are you helping us out?  Yeah, what is that?  Now I'm confused.  Is that like a fucking accessory?  You're walking around with a microwave?  A microwave and a headband.  Go to Williamsburg.  You'll fit right in.  She's just walking around with a microwave.  The fucking...  Remember the Mr. Softy Truck?  Dude, that's the bit.  Yeah.  We have to go to a fucking Williamsburg with our two things and see if anyone notices. 
[01:30:30]  See if anyone even fucking bats an eye.  Yeah, catcher's mid and fuck.  Yeah, fuck any.  We should have Sal actually use the microwave as a wallet like going to a store.  It's just like money in there.  Yeah.  And you got to open the door and give your money and then you put it back and you carry  it around with you.  It's your wallet.  Just pulling an ID out of the microwave.  Yeah, your ID's in there.  It's a great idea.  It'd be great.  It's called Magic Shell.  Thank you, Pittsburgh.  Magic Shell.  That was it.  And you couldn't eat it separate from Magic Shell. 
[01:31:00]  Jimmy P, thank you, bro.  It wasn't chocolatey.  You couldn't mix it with milk.  I remember trying to mix the chocolate shell with milk, like make a chocolate milk.  How long ago?  And it would just clump up.  How long ago?  Oh, this is a long time ago.  Yeah.  Many moons.  I like finally admitting things on this show.  Yeah.  I only learned about Magic Shell 18 months ago.  Not even joking.  Because my niece...  My nieces were over and we went for an ice cream run and I went with my sister-in-law 
[01:31:30]  and she pulled this Magic Shell off the counter and I went, what the fuck is that?  It's a Magic Shell.  It's a Magic Shell.  Wait till you taste this.  I swear to God, I had no idea about it until probably about 18 months ago.  Yeah.  That goes back to when we were growing up?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That shit's old.  Come on.  It's old school.  Are you serious?  Totally serious.  Was it called something else?  No, it's Magic Shell.  I remember when you said Magic Shell, I remember Magic Shell.  Oh, my God.  And I remember trying to mix it with milk to make chocolate milk and it would just clump. 
[01:32:00]  It just fucking clotted in the milk.  It was...  Now it's just milk with chocolate balls in it.  Right.  I know it's kind of hack, but it has to be said, when we wanted a treat, we never had  like chocolate in our house.  But we had that dumb cooking chocolate and we would get so desperate.  Oh, Baker's chocolate?  Yeah.  It would look like regular chocolate.  Unsweetened.  You'd be fooled 10 times.  You'd be convinced the next time you go into the cupboard and break a piece off that  it was real chocolate.  Every time you would get that, oh, my God.  What does it taste like? 
[01:32:30]  It just tastes like nothing.  Chocolate without sugar, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Horrible.  It's bitter.  Very bitter.  Oh, God.  I don't believe you don't like soft surf, though.  That's the best.  I like it, but it's not my number one thing.  I go old school.  It's the greatest.  Like, you know, make that fucking 17-year-old fucking work on their bicep muscle as they  get my ice cream.  Trying to scoop it?  Oh, they hate it.  Oh, they hate it.  Yeah.  I was talking about the Mr. Softy trucks when you would... 
[01:33:00]  They were better than any other ice cream truck, the Mr. Softy trucks, because it  was soft surf.  But they were frightening as a child.  I remember just being afraid of the Mr. Softy truck, because in order to work all that shit,  the soft surf machine, you needed the compressors and the air conditioning units and whatever  to make it cold.  And you walked behind the Mr. Softy truck, and it was like, this big generator motor,  and soot was coming out of it, and the heat that would blow out. 
[01:33:30]  It was just a scary machine to be around before you got your ice cream.  It was petrified.  We never had the Mr. Softy truck in my neighbor, because we lived on a very busy road that killed  all our pets.  Yeah?  Oh.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah, that curve.  Yeah.  Oh.  The ice cream man could never stop there.  No.  That would be a fucking rear-ender.  I swear to God, the only time was when we would go out to my grandma's house, and waiting  wherever, every once in a while, we'd get the Mr. Softy truck.  I was afraid of the Mr. Softy truck. 
[01:34:00]  I was a little fucking faggot for the Mr. Softy truck.  I couldn't deal.  I was afraid of it.  Well, when we were growing up, it was the job of the pedo.  It was.  The pedo job?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Of course.  Yeah.  I think they cleaned up that industry.  But when we were growing up, that's where the pedos were.  I remember just driving around neighborhoods giving out ice cream.  Yeah, I know.  If you were a pedo, of course that's what you would do.  Dream job.  Dream job.  Right.  Holy shit.  You fucking just, they come running after, the children run after you. 
[01:34:30]  Right.  They're running after you.  And you're just like, fucking driving with a boner.  Oh, God.  This is great.  Right.  Oh, I love, oh, God, I'm going to Elm Street.  That's where the hot ones are.  Oh.  Now, it's a nice little small business for somebody.  But back in the day, it was just fucking alcoholic pedos.  I remember the guy from the Mr. Softy Truck also.  He was like this shaved head man or bald-headed man. 
[01:35:00]  And he used to lean out the window to hand your stuff.  And he looked like the amazing colossal man.  He was like big and scary.  I was always petrified as a kid.  Oh, I'm sure.  Very petrified.  I'm sure he did some gel time.  The motor, the fucking baldy colossal man guy.  You want to talk to a guy that actually works for Bimbo?  Oh, by the way, Sam, we learned it's Bimbo.  Bimbo.  Bimbo.  And apparently there's a commercial if you can find it.  Yes.  I'm being told they bought Thomas' English muffins.  No, they didn't.  So they do, in fact, own it. 
[01:35:30]  So what?  They're going to have...  I don't believe this.  So they're going to have toasted English muffins in a bag soon?  I hope so.  Saved me a lot of time.  Bobo said...  Bobo's on the line.  I said on Twitter I was going to call.  It's called Bobo, not Bimbo.  Yeah, if we can get Bobo on that one.  Ah, Roman, what's up, buddy?  You work for the Bimbo company.  Yeah, I actually started working for Sara Lee a couple years ago, and it's like the Mexican cartel.  I think they bought us all out.  Really?  Like $960 million in cash. 
[01:36:00]  All drug money, I'm sure.  All right, I'm sure.  Now, Bimbo, what's their number one product?  Because I have to assume it's not the toasted bread in a bag.  I'm assuming it's really big down south.  We don't have a whole lot of their products here, but they own, like, Antemans.  They don't own Wonder Bread.  No, but what does Bimbo make?  I mean, if they're buying out everyone else, that's fine, but what do they actually make?  They're just the world's largest baker.  They do nothing but baking.  Baking bread.  It is Enzo, the baker.  But then they ran out of things to bake, so they said, ah, put some toast in a bag. 
[01:36:30]  Get some toast in a bag.  They'll buy it.  Yep, that's what they're doing.  They're just...  I don't know.  All right, Roman, thanks for adding absolutely nothing to the discussion.  You're terrific.  He's the bag of toast of phone callers today.  The toast in a bag of phone callers.  Thank you.  Just fuck with you, Roman.  Have a good weekend.  Let's go to the Bimbo commercial.  Sam, please.  B-I-M-B-B-A-R-B-I-M-B-E-R-R-P-A-R-T-C-O  B-I-M-B-A-R-T-C-O  Look for the Bimbo Bear.  Look for the Bimbo Bear. 
[01:37:00]  Never heard of this company before.  He's making a nice sandwich.  Putting it in a...  Lunchbox?  Hold on.  Pause.  I like the song.  Did you have a lunch bale growing up?  A lunchbox?  Yes, I did.  I had a Lost in Space lunchbox.  But you were as poor as me, man.  I don't know what happened.  But you know what happened?  My wife has turned me on to some shit that I went through.  She's like, you don't seem as poor as you talk about. 
[01:37:30]  Because she's seen where I lived and this and that.  Yeah, yeah.  Centerport's not exactly Brentwood.  And then I think my mom, like, psychologically had an issue with money.  I was hoarding money.  Oh, boy.  So I think she always was convinced we were going to be on the street any day.  So I think we might have had more money than I originally thought.  But she was too scared to spend it.  It's okay.  It didn't affect you at all.  I got better.  Good point.  I had some money issues with you.  It was all right.  Fuck. 
[01:38:00]  You know what it is also?  We didn't have as many kids.  It was just me, Dawn, and Joe.  I had seven.  And mom worked like a motherfucker.  Seven in my family.  You know, she worked pretty rugged.  We didn't have fucking lunch boxes.  And she liked that shit.  Like, she definitely enjoyed buying stuff and being a mom.  And, you know, she liked Del Monte stuff instead of, like, store brand.  And she liked to eat, you know, the regular, the real brand shit and not the store brand.  So we always ate pretty well.  We had no frills.  Everything.  Was it no frills? 
[01:38:30]  Everything.  That fucking white label on the...  I think the company went out of business.  I haven't seen no frills in a long time.  I think they were called no frills.  No frills.  Yeah.  It was just...  And they would rework the name of products, like you were saying.  Yeah.  So instead of, like, Captain Crunch, it was, I don't know, the Admirals fucking Snaps.  I don't know.  Yeah.  They changed the name a little bit.  Colonel Crisp.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Oh, no frills is still around, huh?  A&P is no frills?  Really?  I haven't seen them in a supermarket in a long time.  That white label.  I think they stopped with just the white label, though, right? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, because it...  They gussied it up a bit.  Yeah, because you've got to have some colors to...  Yeah, it was just a white can with a label that said corn.  Yeah, look.  Spinach portions.  Portions.  Is a product.  You know, just a white bag.  This is no frills.  They added a little colorful.  Potted meat food product.  I dig some of that potted meat.  Yeah, I remember all this shit.  They put peckers in there.  Mm-hmm.  I beat up my mom a lot, but, I mean, she did what she had.  She had to do, I guess.  Yeah?  Small shells.  What's that?  Pasta. 
[01:39:30]  Why don't they just call it pasta?  Pasta shells.  They have to make the name even shitty.  Pasta's good.  Yeah.  No frills.  Nah, whatever.  Sorry.  Not for me.  People are saying that toasted bread will melt in the microwave.  Yeah, right.  Melt?  I don't believe it.  We've got a microwave here.  Do I really have to open up my toasted fucking bread?  Yeah.  Look, it's one of those bags.  It's like the egg noodle bag. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Can we talk about the egg noodle bag for a second?  All right.  Do you cook egg noodles ever?  I don't cook them, but I have, and I've seen them.  And you try to open it up carefully, and the whole bag...  Rips down the side, and all the noodles fall out.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Been there.  People know what I'm talking about.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Why can't they fucking make the egg noodle bag better?  Come on, Bimbo.  But Bimbo is using the same type of bag, because look, I barely opened it, and it's ripped halfway  on the side.  Well, you're opening the toast.  Can I hear the Bimbo song?  Oh, sure.  All right.  Let me hear the Bimbo song. 
[01:40:30]  It's...  What?  Oh, wow.  Smell this.  It's horrible.  Ew.  Dude, it smells like cardboard.  That's terrible.  I don't think you could have a drier thing in your hand.  This is so dry. 
[01:41:00]  Dude, it's crumbing.  Look at your heads.  Yeah.  I'm just holding it.  This is terrible.  All right.  Where's the microwave?  Hold on.  Over here.  Oh, wow.  You break it.  It's just dust.  Holy shit.  I'm covered in dust.  This is insane.  You got asbestos on you.  This is fucking...  I got mesothelioma from this Bimbo toast.  You got to call that lawyer.  He's looking for cases, that ghoul.  Have you been in contact with Bimbo bread?  Bimbo? 
[01:41:30]  Wow, that's bad.  This is terrible.  People saying I'm stealing Fezzi's brown paper bag story.  Oh.  I thought he took that one from you.  I think he did.  I remember that from many, many years ago.  So what do we do?  Wow, this shit's terrible.  Let's put it in the microwave, Sam.  Yeah.  Microwave it like it says not to.  And Sam, if you could give us a blow-by-blow description when it's microwaving.  Who wants to star in my viral video?  Trust Bimbo.  You're the face of Apple 5.  I don't know if I want to use you. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, I'm already in a stab.  It depends.  Are you looking to build a new star?  Or are you looking to take my brain and hopefully further your video around?  Cock.  Oh, man.  We took some Bimbo bread.  And I put it in a microwave.  And I don't know what it did.  Let me move over to Jimmy's mic.  Jimmy's in where?  Vegas today?  Bimbo.  Bimbo.  Well, the dust coming off of that is crazy, right?  Yeah. 
[01:42:30]  You need a dust mask.  Isn't that going to melt the chair or something with it being right on there?  Oh, E-Rock.  What do you think?  It heats up?  It's a fucking microwave oven.  It's not going to melt the chair.  It works with microwaves.  That's imitation of it.  It's an oven of the future, they call it.  I think my...  Don't break it before we do it.  Look at the dust that comes off it.  I think my brother just got a new car because he just wrote me.  He goes, what channel are you on?  Sirius Radio.  Oh.  Oops.  We're not on a channel on Sirius Radio, right?  Best of Package?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[01:43:00]  That stinks.  That's the next thing we're going to work on around here.  Exactly.  Dumb idea.  Come on.  Just put us on everything.  Everything.  All right.  Just beanbo.  Are we going to try this?  Beanbo.  Put some beanbo bread in the microwave because...  Hey, do you want to set this up, Ant?  Well...  Hold on, hold on.  One, two, and we're rolling.  Hi.  If you look over there, there's beanbo  toasted bread.  It's toast...  I don't like how that...  Hold on a minute.  I'm directing you.  Oh, okay. 
[01:43:30]  Fuck the radio show.  You've got to be holding the...  All right.  I should be holding the toasted bread.  Right.  All right.  Hey, it is Friday.  Hey, you're lucky we're even here today.  Shut up.  All right.  All right.  Wait.  All right.  Show the camera.  All right.  Go.  Hi.  This is beanbo toasted bread.  It's toast in a bag, which is crazy enough, but who would think that there's a caution,  do not microwave warning on it?  So, I guess we're going to see what happens when you do microwave beanbo toasted bread. 
[01:44:00]  Sam's putting it in.  I hope something happens.  I don't know why it's so dangerous.  Do we have a fire extinguisher?  Oh, boy.  The microwave is precariously perched on a little lounge chair, a Lazy Boy recliner.  30 seconds, and there it goes.  All right.  Is it rotating? 
[01:44:30]  Is it a rotating microwave?  It's rotating.  It's rotating.  Yeah.  It's rotating.  We're about 10 seconds in.  There are no flames to be seen just yet.  No flames.  Nothing happening.  It's very dry bread, and microwaves work off of moisture.  They actually agitate the molecules.  You're kidding me.  And because of the friction between the molecules, it heats up the food.  Since there's no moisture in that, I would just think nothing happens.  But a caution is kind of silly. 
[01:45:00]  There's the little signal that it's...  All right.  What do you got?  Touch it.  Yeah.  Take it out.  Is it hot?  It's slightly warm.  It's slightly warm.  Wow.  That's dangerous.  Oh, my God.  Worst viral video ever.  Back to the drawing board for the Ops.  Oh, well, maybe you could put it up as the viral video, but then put the basketball shot.  I wouldn't do that.  Up there.  That would not be nice to the people out there.  That would work. 
[01:45:30]  What if we just put it in for like 10 minutes, and we just continue to do the show?  That's a good idea.  And then if something happens...  That's a great idea.  Should I just throw 10 minutes on the microwave?  Yeah.  Yeah, let it rip with 10 minutes of a high-power nuking of the abeambo bread.  A beambo.  A beambo.  Oh, he's putting it on the floor.  Just in case.  Just in case.  Why just in case?  What if the whole thing blows up?  How's the...  Microwaves don't blow up.  I don't think a microwave's ever blown up.  Wow.  Slamming the door.  Sam's a little pissed. 
[01:46:00]  He really is.  What's going on here?  I think he's representing the listeners right now.  He really is.  All right.  There we go.  10 minutes.  10 minutes.  The bimbo bread's in there.  And this mic will be for the mic.  All right.  Jimmy's mic is as close as it could get, which is still 10 feet away.  All right.  But I guess if something happens, we'll know.  You were very good in the video, but unfortunately no one will see it.  I know.  It's not...  You know, I'm on the cutting room floor at Opie Studios.  At Opie Lou Studios.  Right.  I didn't make the...  Viral video studios. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shut up, Sam.  I will get you someday.  Oh, Sam, with his 5 million plus views.  Well, why don't you just put a guy from iPhone video microwaves bimbo bread.  Well, that would kind of be good.  And then you could tie...  You could use his...  Oh, it's not a bad idea.  Right.  And then I write microwaving toast for no reason.  Okay.  It's smoking.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  It's smoking.  Wait.  I can maybe...  Oh, shit.  Hold on.  Maybe...  What's it doing?  It's smoking.  Dude, dude.  It smells burnt.  Move. 
[01:47:00]  Dude.  Move.  Oh, man.  I can't believe you missed it.  Move.  I'll displace this in.  Dude, that was under a minute.  What happened to the...  Oh, you only did 30 seconds.  Right.  Why don't you turn off the microwave?  Because there's smoke coming out of the back of it.  Turn it back on.  Turn it back on.  You've got to do it.  I'm not doing it.  You've got to push start.  All right.  I'll buy it.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  Holy shit.  It's smoking like crazy.  Oh, my God.  Dude, it's going to start on fire.  It's definitely going to start on fire.  Do we have a smoke detector in here?  Yes.  We're going to get in a lot of trouble.  Dude, it's going to start on fire.  All right.  Well...  We need a fire extinguisher.  Holy shit.  It's smoking like crazy.  I got some seltzer. 
[01:47:30]  You're right above the smoke detector.  No, I'm touching it.  Don't fucking throw water on it.  Oh.  It's a microwave.  Just open the door.  Hit stop on the microwave.  Hit stop on it.  Dude, it might flash fire if you open it.  It might flash fire.  Don't open it.  It's going to roll over on you.  Did you ever see fucking those movies?  Don't open it.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  It's smoking like crazy.  I got it.  Can you open this?  Oh, my God. 
[01:48:00]  Everyone get on the floor.  Lay low.  Lay low.  Oh, cool.  We got a fire extinguisher just in case.  It burst into flames.  Holy fuck.  Danger.  Do not microwave the bag toast.  See?  They were right.  Holy shit.  It's fucking smoky as hell in here.  And it reeks.  Where does it say that again?  Right there.  Caution.  Oh, God.  Do not microwave. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  I foresee us getting in big trouble now for smoking.  Yes.  Yes.  I foresee this not ending well as far as management goes.  Oh, God.  It stinks in here now.  Smells like a fire.  We probably weren't even supposed to take the microwave down from upstairs.  Oh.  Oh.  That was Salvo.  That was Sal for the record.  Just put the microwave back and make believe it didn't happen.  What happened?  I want to know the science behind that.  Why did it burn? 
[01:49:00]  We're going to get the smell out of here by having Sal bring the microwave back up with  the beanbow still in it.  With the beanbow.  A beanbow.  Troy from...  Oh, Troy.  Troy's waving his hand.  Troy, what happened?  Troy, we can't be in trouble for this, right?  The whole hallway stinks.  My studio stinks.  Dude, remember that the vent, the air ventilation goes into the other studios?  Oh, are we in trouble?  Yeah, Sal, get that fucking out of there.  Oh, my God. 
[01:49:30]  Sal is actually wearing a top hat and flippers.  It's so smoky in here.  It's really smoky.  Holy shit.  Well.  Oh, boy, am I going to do it.  I'm going to do a splice-a-roo to make believe that's all one video.  Make it one piece, sure.  I'm bringing it to Ron Howard Studios.  People are going to see that we set it for 30 seconds and ask why it's counting down from 
[01:50:00]  eight minutes in the splice.  No one will notice.  Shut up, Sam.  This is terrible in here now.  It's really bad.  Yeah, it is.  I'm going to open the door again.  I don't know.  Why?  We can't open the door?  Just turn the air conditioner down so it stays on, and it'll vent out of here.  Can we microwave all the shit while we have the microwave for a few more minutes?  I don't really think we should push it.  Really?  Yeah.  Microwave.  This can of V8 closed.  Nice.  What would happen?  I don't know, but it wouldn't be good.  I bet it would explode. 
[01:50:30]  You know what a can of V8 going off in a microwave would look like?  This is a bunch of kids who cut school for a day.  Yes.  Come on, man.  We're making viral videos.  Yeah.  We moved the microwave to a different room with beambo still in it.  And why didn't we have just a cute kitten walking around as we did our fucking viral video?  Damn it.  Otter's holding hands.  You know what?  Otter's holding hands.  A little kitten.  Just wander around in the background.  Maui.  Right.  Oh, the kitten would have coughed. 
[01:51:00]  Would have been adorable.  It would have been.  Love a kitten.  All right.  We got a jingle contest entries next.  We got some Jocktober possibly.  We got Mitt Romney and Obama kind of being funny.  I think Romney was very funny.  His delivery was good.  He, the jokes, obviously he didn't write them, but he delivered them well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they were kind of really self-deprecating and stuff. 
[01:51:30]  You want to play one going into break?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got Mitt Starks with the debates and Governor Cuomo.  Is that a good one?  Yeah.  That's kind of good.  Yeah, that's the beginning of it.  All right.  We'll play a little Mitt Romney.  It was the Al.  It's gold, Jerry.  Gold.  It was the what?  Al Smith?  Al.  The Al Smith.  Al.  Yeah.  Catholic Charities.  Why do they have to do that?  I don't know.  What does this have to do with running the country?  Well, they always go into this.  Oh, boy.  Here goes the morning mashup waving their hands. 
[01:52:00]  I think they're mad.  We're in trouble.  Oh, boy.  We're in trouble.  We didn't know.  We're making toast.  We didn't know.  You know, our forefathers wanted us to make toast, so we made toast.  We didn't know.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Get rid of the shit.  Mitt Starks with the debates and Governor Cuomo.  Yeah.  We'll play this into break.  Glad to be able to join in this venerable tradition. 
[01:52:30]  And, of course, I'm pleased that the President's here.  We were chatting pleasantly this evening as if Tuesday night never happened.  And I credit that, of course, to the Cardinal.  He has taken New York's highest spiritual authority to get us back on our best behavior.  I was actually hoping the President would bring Joe Biden along this evening, because he'll laugh at anything.  Of course, this isn't a night for serious politics, and it was especially nice to see President Obama and Cardinal Dolan sharing the dais, despite their differences. 
[01:53:00]  I'm sure the Cardinal has no hard feelings, and we might get an indication of that during dinner to see if the President's wine turns into water.  Or, for that matter, whether my water turns into wine. 
[01:53:30]  I'm pleased to once again have the chance to see Governor Cuomo, who's already being talked about for higher office.  A very impressive fellow, but he may be getting a little ahead of himself.  I mean, let me get this straight.  The man is put in one term as a governor.  He has a father who happened to be a governor, and he thinks that's enough to run for president.  Welcome back, everybody, to Adventures in Docking. 
[01:54:00]  Now, as we all know, docking is when two gay men have their penises erect,  and one man takes the foreskin of his penis and stretches it over the head of the other man's penis.  So, let's go to the phones.  Let's see, we have Sam here from New York.  Let's see.  Now, Sam, when did this docking fetish begin for you? 
[01:54:30]  Well, I was in college.  I was a freshman in college, so I came home for spring break, and I scheduled it to do it on the first day.  Wow, the very first day, huh?  You sure are eager to try new things.  Yeah.  So, like, what made you even want to get into docking in the first place?  For whatever reason, I wasn't circumcised, obviously, when I was born.  Okay, so I see what you're saying.  Basically, you figured, hey, I have this extra skin on my penis.  I might as well use it to my sexual advantage.  Yes.  Now, Sam, would you say that your penis is big enough for proper docking?  Like, I don't know, six inches? 
[01:55:00]  I mean, I don't know if I'm quite there.  It's average.  It's fine.  Now, it says here that you once tried to dock with a very large black gentleman, and it didn't quite work out.  Tell me about that.  The hole in the foreskin, it wasn't big enough to stretch over.  Well, over his giant cock head.  Gotcha.  So, it wasn't getting stuck to the head.  Right.  It's not stuck to the head.  It's just the hole is too small to fit over the head.  That is so embarrassing.  What did you do about it?  Going forward, I don't want to have to have an explanation.  And so, we went to the urologist to get, you know, a word on it. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  So, you wanted to get your foreskin stretched out so you could dock with bigger men.  The urologist said, you know, it happens.  It's not typical if you want to change it for aesthetics or for whatever reason.  It's a simple procedure, and you come in, and you do it, and you're out.  Well, that's great.  Now, you can dock with anybody.  Yeah, that's correct.  Well, Sam, thanks for the call.  This is all the time we have for Adventures in Docking this week.  Join us next week, where we'll be discussing proper docking techniques at a pumping party.  See you then. 
[01:56:00]  The Opinetry Show.  How?  Who does this?  There's a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree.  How?  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree.  This is how the story goes. 
[01:56:30]  This is how the story goes.  I was walking around at probably one in the morning, walking around my house, like, you  know, just grabbing some grapes or some shit from the fridge.  And I just found myself out loud.  No one else is in my house.  I'm alone.  Just going, there's a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  Just walking around my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  It is fun to say. 
[01:57:00]  I was just saying it to nobody but myself and laughing to myself.  Hopefully we'll have more Scott sound bites before Jack Tober ends.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  That was a good one.  Next week.  By the way, that was Rob Zombie.  That was Zombie?  Mm-hmm.  Zombie redid that?  Mm-hmm.  Why would he redo Brick House?  I think he did it around time.  Silly.  House of a Thousand Corpses.  Yeah.  He did it with Lionel Richie.  He actually did it with Lionel Richie?  Mm-hmm.  It doesn't sound bad.  Sounds awesome.  I like Zombie.  That sounds awesome. 
[01:57:30]  Why don't you fucking get his name tattooed on your fucking arm?  I don't like him that much.  Did that already.  Oh, shit.  We go back when it was White Zombie before Rob decided, fuck the white people in this  band.  I'm taking it all.  Just Rob Zombie.  Good enough.  Good enough.  Him and Marilyn Manson almost got in a fight the other day.  Holy shit.  Why?  Two fucking pussies clawing at each other.  Because Marilyn Manson, because they're on tour together, and I guess Marilyn Manson went  on late, but Rob Zombie was like, you got to keep to your time.  Because Marilyn's going on first, obviously. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Oh, just open.  And so he did his time, but he was pissed, because he couldn't play Beautiful People  or something, because he went on late.  And so his set got cut short.  Marilyn Manson's a complete asshole, but he's got a couple good songs, man.  Beautiful people.  And then he says he's going to go and kick Rob Zombie's ass.  Marilyn Manson isn't kicking anyone's ass.  No one's ass.  Especially Rob Zombie's.  And then Rob Zombie got on stage and said, he started calling him by his real name. 
[01:58:30]  Nice.  Oh, man.  And he said he didn't say anything to him, and he kept...  Did he bring up that he was the friend in the Wonder Gears?  Yeah.  He started doing Alice Cooper covers and calling Marilyn Manson a pussy.  Whoa.  Holy shit.  And Marilyn Manson, who said he was going to kick Rob Zombie's ass, did he come out and  kick his ass?  No, he didn't do shit.  Of course not.  Wow.  And then he got his...  Too busy putting spectra, spectra, spectrum, spectra.  Yeah, whatever that is.  Yeah.  If they were black, someone would have been shot. 
[01:59:00]  True.  Right?  Instead, they got their behavior together, and Marilyn Manson shaped up so they could continue  their tour.  Oh.  Is it a work?  That's not a work.  Marilyn Manson's just an asshole.  Is he?  Yes.  Rob Zombie would say yes.  What's up, pussy?  Why don't we take a look at the jingle contest and see how we're doing?  And then we can move into Jocktober nice, and then we can get the fuck out of here.  That's what I say.  Jocktobery.  Maybe some more Mitt Romney and Obama jokes from the Al Smith benefit. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  There's folks in my cup.  Oh, you want to play that?  You'll love that one.  It's great.  Yeah, this is a favorite of the staff.  This guy, George Huckus.  Huh?  Listeners are starting to just randomly comment on Facebook posts with Coke floats in my cup.  Nice.  We're going to want to get the people's vote on this, by the way.  I'm not saying that's how we're going to pick the winner, but it might influence our  voting.  I want to see what the listeners think of these jingles in the end. 
[02:00:00]  But a lot of people loving George Huckus and his jingle for the jingle contest, courtesy  of IHStevenSinger.com.  $2,000 to the winner.  Feet up on the board like I run the show.  Hoagie in my mouth.  Hoagie in my mouth.  E-rock on me, nigga.  E-rock.  E-rock.  E-rock on me, nigga.  E-rock.  E-rock.  E-rock.  Fat boy in his seat, bikini girls on the screen.  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup. 
[02:00:30]  Fat boy in his seat, bikini girls on his screen.  Did you tell the guy that another verse would be awesome?  I'm going to see if he can do the song.  I bet he fucks it up.  He probably will.  You think it'll be like Grey Wolf?  Yeah, we got a Grey Wolf situation.  Like Grey Wolf.  It's a white guy doing that, by the way.  Really?  Yeah.  Not bad.  He does a very good impression.  DMX.  Yeah.  He doesn't like DMX.  Oh.  Really?  Yeah, no, he doesn't.  Fuck.  And people are liking Sleeves' Kick the Can, but it's long. 
[02:01:00]  I don't feel like playing it right now.  It's so long.  I don't feel like listening to it.  But we also have Party by Joe Liga.  A lot of people are enjoying this one, too.  Burpee gets the lube.  Jimmy pops the ball.  It's a cuckold party.  That's creepy.  Jimmy cups the balls.  Oh.  Jimmy cups the balls.  I got the lube.  Jimmy's got the ball.  What does Ant do?  Just watch.  But what is that last line? 
[02:01:30]  I don't understand.  It's a cuckold party.  It's a cuckold party.  Yeah, Jimmy cups the balls.  Right, now we've got to hear it again.  Yeah, listen to it.  Burpee gets the lube.  Jimmy preps the ball.  It's a cuckold party.  I think it's preps the ball.  I still think it's preps the ball.  Yeah, I think it's preps the ball.  Listen again.  And I think you are the ball, Anthony.  Let's listen again.  Could be preps the ball.  Okay.  Because I'll tell you why.  It doesn't sound like there's a plural at the end of the ball or bull word. 
[02:02:00]  All right, all right.  Let me hear.  So you got your genitals out.  I got the lube.  All right.  And Jimmy is prepping the ball.  Jesus.  And then we move on to the cuckold party.  All right, let's hear.  Burpee gets the lube.  Jimmy preps the ball.  Yeah.  It's a cuckold party.  Yes, it's prep the ball.  You're right.  So, you know, excuse me while I kiss the sky kind of thing happening there. 
[02:02:30]  And then sleeves.  I want to acknowledge this is good, but it's just too long.  I don't know.  We got new ones to play today.  Oh, there's a little leaf going on your way.  Hello, Timothy.  Yes, go.  There it is.  I did not like that video.  No, it was scary.  It is fucking creepy.  There's a nice concept there.  I like it.  Oh, there's another one.  Oh, Walter's always sleeping.  There goes Jake.  Go.  Go, Sarah.  Sarah.  Sarah, catch up to Willie.  Keep moving. 
[02:03:00]  Keep moving.  That way.  That way.  That way.  You don't want to be stuck over there.  That ghoul he is.  I swear I'm not doing it for the...  Oh, Edgar.  Edgar.  Look, I'll acknowledge I do stuff just for the show, but in this case, I really do like  sleeves.  I'm not trying to get under your scale.  I know.  I really do like this guy.  People like him.  I don't know what it is.  I like him.  He do.  He creeps me out a little bit.  Yeah.  And coming from me, wow.  He's walking in the woods.  I know.  With a cane.  And he's got to help the leaves along. 
[02:03:30]  This reminds me of a Slender Man video.  The Shepherd.  The Shepherd of Leaves.  Yeah, the Shepherd of Leaves.  Did we put it on our Facebook page so people could enjoy it?  I just picture the camera spinning around, though, and some fucking cut-in-half woman's  body is on the ground.  Yes, I'm covering her with leaves.  Right.  Yes.  No, see, I didn't cover her with leaves because I was too busy helping the leaves downstream.  Helping her so long downstream.  What do you do with you, Ash?  He's so ghoulish.  Sleeves, I know you're out there, man. 
[02:04:00]  I like you.  Yeah.  And I do like that Christmas song.  I like life like I like my shirts.  Sleeveless.  So we got today's contestants for the Jingle Contest.  Yeah.  Where do they send them?  Although people are knowing that already because a lot of entries are coming in, right?  Didn't you get like 70 overnight?  Yeah.  I mean, we're over 200 at this point.  Wow.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Thank you.  People love this contest.  And it's just not stopping.  Like, every time I check the email, there's more entries. 
[02:04:30]  Wow.  I'll be Anthony at SiriusXM.com.  So Travis picked some of the ones to listen to today.  Obviously, we're not going to listen to all 70 or whatever that came in.  I'll guarantee you I've listened to all 70.  All right.  You picked seven that are worth playing on the radio today.  And the first one.  Only one about Eric.  Is Lucas Hunted.  Oh.  What?  Came up with this for the, I guess it's the ONA Audio Contest at this point.  All right. 
[02:05:00]  Oh.  Eric is a dummy.  Stole some pictures from Opie.  He has a child's mentality.  Can't go an hour without eating.  Some think he rocked his brain less.  I say retarded at best. 
[02:05:30]  Now go to break, you dirty hooped that fuck.  Go to break so he can have his good lunch.  All right.  I mean, it's a great song.  Yeah.  I like how the guy had to use the match theme because it's an instrumental that he can get off the TV.  The TV.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good there, Lucas.  The next one is Untitled. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Are you hiding the titles from us?  No, no, no.  A lot of people just, you know, send it as OA jingle.  Okay.  Some people title theirs.  Chris Holland, you made the cut today.  Oh.  Chiz bucket, chiz bucket.  Chiz, chiz, chiz bucket.  Howling Greg Hughes.  I started howling.  Arian Anthony Cumia.  Tell them to behave in Jim Norton.  You cunt.  Little Jim Norton.  Yeah. 
[02:06:30]  Bob Kelly has the physique of a snowman.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's nice.  I like it.  We're all addressed in there.  It's technically well produced.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not going to win.  No.  No, but it was good.  It was all right.  It was in my cup.  Yeah.  Is that running away?  Right now it is.  By far, yeah.  I just want a second verse badly.  David, did you mean?  No.  That's correct. 
[02:07:00]  Dawood?  That's how he spelled it.  Dawood Woldu.  What a name is that?  I don't know.  What the fuck is going on here?  I have a tough time with easy names.  What the fuck?  Maybe it's a hipster name.  It's a hipster.  Maybe.  There it is.  Here's his entry.  I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  That isn't cool.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  That isn't cool.  Oh, man.  That, that, that, that, that.  Oh, man. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  That isn't cool.  That, man.  That, man.  That, man.  That isn't cool.  Damn.  Oh, man.  All right.  That's pretty good.  I don't know.  It's a little repetitive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually, a lot repetitive.  It's all it is, is repetitive.  All right.  Repetitive.  Repetitive.  The more you say that word, the less it becomes a word.  Listen, it's repetitive.  Repetitive.  Well, we can certainly move on to the next entry, then.  Yeah.  Why don't we do David Cooper?  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  We're going to tear down the sixth wall today.  We know everything about radio.  We're going to tear down the eighth wall for you today.  I'm going to tear down the 18th wall today.  How many walls do you have?  Can we get a contractor in here?  Buck actually asked for some mayo, and he's making egg salad on the wall and licking it  off.  It doesn't matter, though.  They're taking that wall down in the next few weeks.  What do you want on this wall?  Don't tear down a wall.  I'll freaking throw it down.  No, I was going to pop up the ceiling tile and peek over.  Now, we just have one wall.  Just wait until you see what we do next. 
[02:08:30]  That's kind of good, man.  Yeah.  Let me guess.  I have another crutch.  Tearing down the wall.  No, that was everybody.  That was everybody talking about walls.  And then you got the doors in there.  Nice.  Yeah, the doors.  I like it.  And the walls.  I like it.  Not bad.  Thank you, David Cooper.  Oh, we go back to Lucas Hunton.  What?  He sent in multiples?  Wow.  A lot of people sent in multiples.  And he gets two plays.  Look at him.  He's good.  Out of 70 entries overnight, Lucas Hunton came up with a second one that's worth playing. 
[02:09:00]  It's called Radio Wizard.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  I see where he's going.  Okay.  Okay.  Ever since he was a young boy.  He's been fucking bored.  Ever since he...  Holy shit.  Wow.  Wow.  He doesn't...  This kid doesn't fuck around. 
[02:09:30]  Holy shit.  I don't think I've ever laughed harder at a song.  Oh, he didn't go there.  He didn't go there.  Oh, boy.  That was quick.  Right out of the box.  All right.  Let's try to get through this.  Hi, Gary.  Ever since he was a young boy. 
[02:10:00]  He's been fucking bored.  His better instincts, he just clutters up the hall.  Asking him a question's like talking to a wall.  That egg-headed dummy doesn't like the show at all.  He's the radio wizard, but doesn't know shit.  The radio wizard is such a stupid twit. 
[02:10:30]  Why do you think he doesn't like the show?  I wish that he would.  That's funny, man.  That's pretty fucking funny.  That one had me going.  The radio wizard.  You know what?  Fucking...  I'll tell you right now.  E-Rock Army nigga has some competition.  Yeah.  I'll tell you right the fuck now.  Word.  You're tears in your eyes.  I'm tearing up, too, man. 
[02:11:00]  That was a good one.  I rarely tear.  That got me bad.  Fuck.  From the top of the song.  Holy shit.  Next one is from Don Carpenter.  We're going through our entries for the jingle contest.  Today's entries.  They're coming in like crazy.  I've already got Mondays ready.  Really?  Oh, man.  Well, yeah, because I don't want to give you like 20 entries a day.  IHateStevenSinger.com.  Thank you.  $2,000 up for grabs.  How long did the people have before?  Got another two weeks, I think.  Oh, this is going to be all right, man.  She just did jingle shows. 
[02:11:30]  Don Carpenter, everyone.  Hang on.  I'll tell you one.  November 9th.  What?  Oh, like three weeks.  Nice.  So I have more years than I got.  So I have more years than I got.  So I have more years than I got.  I already know.  I got a tree on my house.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  That's what that was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I figured it out.  And the last one for today is Brian Webster. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, he is a psycho prick.  He's changed so much since he had a kid.  Anthony's a drunk Nazi.  He loves big guns and his girl's young.  Little Jimmy, he can't sleep.  He loves trannies and fat pussies.  Sam's half black and he rocks bad.  It's the only show.  Shove it up your ass.  He was trying for a, yeah.  Suck my fucking cock. 
[02:12:30]  Okay ones in there.  And that was just weird.  Who do you guys think the winner is for today?  For today?  Jesus.  Radio Wizard.  Come on.  Although, E-Rock MASH is pretty good.  This guy's good.  Which one?  Was there another one in there that was pretty good?  I think those are the two today, right?  Those are the standouts.  What did you say?  Radio Wizard again.  Eric wants to hear Radio Wizard again.  Eric Nagel is requesting that you play it again.  Eric Nagel.  We got to do a little catch up anyway.  So why don't we play this in a break? 
[02:13:00]  The jingle contest open for everyone except for the Canadians.  Ha ha.  Two thousand dollars courtesy of Stephen Singer.  IHateStevenSinger.com.  Yeah.  And the email address for the people that want to send in an entry?  OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  No and in there.  OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  Very good.  Here's the Radio Wizard again.  Ever since he was a young boy, he's been fucking bored. 
[02:13:30]  His venison stinks, he just clutters up the hall.  Asking him a question's like talking to a wall.  That egghead dummy doesn't like the show at all.  He's the Radio Wizard but doesn't know shit.  The Radio Wizard is such a stupid twit. 
[02:14:00]  Why do you think he doesn't like the show?  I wish that he would.  Coke floats in my cup.  E-Rock Army, nigga.  This is the OpieAnthony channel.  Doi buo qi.  Wo mii la lu.

[02:16:30]  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Series XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, it's Jocktober.  Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober. 
[02:17:00]  OMG.  Hosts, holes, bits, and stunt boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jocktober.  I got a tree on my house.  Very excited today.  You are?  Before I announce the show, I want to start with a little pre-game.  Oh, good, good.  Here comes the pre.  Really?  All right.  Oh, no. 
[02:17:30]  Hi, who's this?  Yeah, this is Bobo.  Oh, that poor kid.  I wonder what he's up to.  Our pal, Jenny Hutt.  Yeah, this is Bobo.  Aye.  Aye.  Click.  Relax.  We'll get back to you eventually.  Oh, Bobo.  Fuck.  A little on the needy side.  Holy fuck.  We'll get back to you eventually.  Relax.  Yeah.  Maybe. 
[02:18:00]  Maybe.  Jenny Hutt, who does a show here at SiriusXM.  This is the pre-game.  That's right.  We got a quick clip of Jenny Hutt.  She still does a show here?  Yeah, they put her in a closet for an hour a day.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  All right.  That's a show?  Yeah.  Okay.  Just Jenny.  That's a show.  Just Jenny.  That's a show.  And she was on Showbiz Tonight, really?  Yeah, she started doing a bunch of that talking head, bad pop culture stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  Hmm. 
[02:18:30]  I don't know why she gets to do it.  Well, we haven't been asked.  Are you saying Jenny Hutt better than us?  She puts on a better show than you, yeah.  Fuck.  I'll say that.  Well, she was acting like a hole on Showbiz Tonight.  What about you, Jenny Hutt?  Boo Boo's mom says, by the way, Boo Boo has never seen any of Walken's movies.  It's Boo Boo.  I would guess that's pretty accurate.  She did a good job, though.  I think she did a great job.  I happen to really love the Honey Boo Boo and Mama June version.  I love the dynamic between the two of them so much. 
[02:19:00]  I can't get enough.  I cannot get enough of Honey Boo Boo.  I would have liked to see them reenact the Pulp Fiction scene with The Needle and Uma Thurman  and John Travolta.  Oh, AJ.  Well, I don't know.  All right.  Oh, AJ.  Well, fuck.  You had to add something.  You added nothing to the discussion.  Whole thing was that.  I don't know.  That was a complete whole line.  Yeah.  Oh, AJ.  Oh, AJ.  You got to admit, though.  You're talking about TV that anybody can turn on and watch.  AJ took it a little far with that one. 
[02:19:30]  He did.  Needles.  I hear you.  You know.  Oh, AJ.  Does she look better on TV than when she's just walking around those boys?  Oh, now.  Oh, Opie.  I would say she looks about the same.  Oh, babe.  So the makeup doesn't do shit.  Now.  She's just wondering.  Oh, no.  Time for Jocktober.  Yes, it is.  Does she hang around just to get celebrity photos?  Yes, she does.  Oh, is she Jimmy?  Yeah.  The fuck is that?  No, but she does it like she'll be here for hours trying to get celebrity photos.  She'll be here for hours. 
[02:20:00]  Jimmy sort of works around his schedule.  Right.  That's the difference.  Does he?  I've seen Jimmy stay here until 3 p.m.  All right.  Is somebody supposed to get his picture of Shaq signed or something?  That was yesterday's mission.  It was yesterday?  How was the mission?  Accomplished?  Was it successful, E-Rock?  Yep.  All done.  We didn't talk about this on the air, right?  No.  Jimmy wanted only E-Rock to take care of this task.  He didn't trust anyone else, and he went through exactly what you were supposed to do, right?  Yes.  And what were you supposed to do? 
[02:20:30]  And how big is the picture?  He had a big, one of those big art portfolio bags.  It's a poster, not a picture.  Now he's making up posters.  Well, if they're big people.  Only if they're big people.  But even small people can get big in a poster.  But no, but his logic is, if they're tall in real life, I want a poster.  Right.  He only has two posters so far.  Jimmy's crazy.  He's got...  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, because it's a tall person, so that has to be a poster.  Right.  This is his logic, his latest logic. 
[02:21:00]  And then we'll have to ask him about it on Monday.  He told me that he had to make Shaq that big because Kareem was already that big.  Yeah.  And because Kareem was already a big poster, Shaq has to be a big poster.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He has nowhere to put this stuff.  No.  So anyway, so he brought in the big Shaq poster to be signed.  It's Shaq and Jimmy, of course.  Mm-hmm.  Specially made poster.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Four foot by two foot.  Four foot by two foot.  By two foot.  High gloss.  High gloss.  Yeah.  Poster.  In this art portfolio bag that you would bring sketch work and stuff. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you see people walking in and out of art studios with these giant flat things with  handles on them.  He's got one of those.  Giant.  Four foot by two.  He's got everything.  He's got everything he needs for his addiction.  Fucking amazing.  All right, so then what happened?  So I was instructed, had to be laid out on a table, something flat, with also the special  paper that he had with the photo under it. 
[02:22:00]  Because if you lay it down just on a table and there's some kind of crumb or something  on the table, if you go to sign, it'll make the dent into the photo.  He explained all this to you.  Yeah, so I had to carefully take it out by the edges.  He said by the edges?  By the edges, because he doesn't want fingerprints smearing up the photo.  Unless it's Shaq's fingerprints, nobody's allowed to smear this thing.  So you have to pull it out by the edges from the bag with the special paper.  Did he show you this or just tell you?  He showed it to me.  He demonstrated.  Yes, he did. 
[02:22:30]  And he will, by the way, when he gets back here on Monday, study the poster.  To make sure none of the rules were broken.  Yes.  He is a nut.  I pull it out and it has special protective paper on top of it.  Like what?  Almost like trace paper?  Yeah, like that.  On top of it, which you have to take off gently and display it out there.  I had a post-it note with his name off to the side, not on the photo so it wouldn't stick  to the photo so that Shaq would know to sign it to Jimmy. 
[02:23:00]  Sign it to Jimmy Norton.  We got Shaq.  As soon as he came up in the elevator, he was walking into the lobby.  Shaq came over, signed it.  He pointed and looked at it like he recognized it but didn't say anything.  And he goes, what's his name?  And I said, Jimmy.  Signs everything there.  He goes, there you go.  And somebody's, I guess, Getty's taking photos of him signing Jimmy's photo.  He decides to lean on the poster like this.  With his arm?  With his arm.  Like that.  As they're taking some of the photos.  Did you say, hey, you stupid guy? 
[02:23:30]  No.  This guy could have easily killed me.  Oh.  So he signed everything.  He walked away.  I had to get the trace paper, put it back on there after two minutes so I could let the  ink dry.  He told you to wait two minutes?  Well, he said you have to give it some time to let it.  Did you time it?  Yeah, I timed it.  And I made sure.  Pulled out his iPhone fucking stopwatch.  Put the trace paper back on it with the protective paper on the bottom.  Slid it back into the bag.  Zipped it up.  Handed it to Club Soda Kenny.  Who then took it?  Dude.  Here's. 
[02:24:00]  Now the posters, it's going to be a problem even though Shaq kind of like creased it with  his elbow.  It didn't look.  You're going to have to tell Jimmy it's not your elbow.  You know that.  But if it's Shaq, it's fine.  Dude, dude.  Do you have proof it's Shaq?  Because he's going to ask for the proof.  The Getty photographer.  All right.  You might want to get that picture because he will call you out on it.  He'll go, what the fuck happened to the poster?  You know what?  Eric's going to have to buy a Getty picture to prove his image.  You know what would be the greatest thing and worth the price?  Take that fucking thing to somewhere.  Get another one made. 
[02:24:30]  And completely fuck it up.  Like sign it bad.  Smudge it.  Put shit under it like sand.  Crump.  So it comes through.  Kink up the corners.  And then put it in his little folder thing.  And just leave it.  So when he opens it up and pulls it out, he loses his fucking mind.  And just say you brought it to lunch and you dropped it in the street in a camera.  Yeah.  He would lose his fucking mind.  Jim has an account with a private photo lab that's always on call.  He's always on call. 
[02:25:00]  Ah, Jimmy is a fucking lunatic.  I used to be that guy.  It was too much pressure.  It is.  It was too much stress.  When I was hanging out with Jimmy, I had to take the pictures.  We've all had to take the pictures.  And I just couldn't do it anymore.  It was way too stressful.  And then it's just going to sit in the portfolio.  Yeah, my mistake.  Everyone has made a mistake.  And when you make a mistake with the picture taken, you're done.  He finds someone else.  Yeah, yeah.  And mine was the famous down in Philly.  You get one chance.  It was Zombie?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it was Rob Zombie.  And I made the mistake of having a window behind Jim Norton and Rob Zombie. 
[02:25:30]  And there was a supernova happening behind them from the flash.  I wish it was.  Then he would have a real reason.  It was a slight flash that he could see in the reflection.  And he had to get that all photoshopped out.  And I think that was the last picture I ever told for Jimmy.  That was it.  I mean, he talked to me about that photo years and years and years later.  Oh, yeah.  That was his, like, example of what?  What did he say?  Of a screw-up.  Well, like, I don't remember.  Like, we were talking about Rob Zombie and how I like him or something.  And the first tidbit of information he had about Rob Zombie was that, yeah, I got a shot with him once. 
[02:26:00]  But, oh, he fucked it up.  He took the photo.  And there was a flash in the background.  We were in front of a window.  And the whole thing was fucked up.  Still upset?  Yeah, he's not happy about the way to.  Oh, he's still not happy about it.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, he's met Rob Zombie multiple times since then.  He's just not happy about that one.  Well, that's just it, too.  Like, he sees these people over and over again.  It's not like he just sees them once.  Half of them are like, oh, I like your comedy.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:26:30]  You know, hey, Jimmy.  All right, well, I'm glad it was a successful mission there.  Yes.  A little stressful, though, huh?  Very stressful.  Oh, fuck you.  Come on, man.  Come on.  You're the go-to guy, though.  He likes you.  Congrats.  Because I helped him with, remember when he got Black Sabbath at the rock and roll?  Oh, yeah, that was a, oh, my God, was that a biggie.  That picture had to fly places.  He had the big blown-up photo that he brought in when Black Sabbath with Dio came in.  And we had to have a special table in the back of the old studio, laid out, perfectly 
[02:27:00]  clean so the photo could lay there, multiple markers for everyone to sign it.  Oh, it was a big pain in the ass.  Yeah, and someone had to stand near the table the entire time while Black Sabbath is on the  couch and you guys are doing the interview.  Yeah.  Oh, someone had to guard the table.  Yeah, I think Pat Duffy was standing by the table the entire time.  By the way, that is another poster he has.  He does have that.  Yeah, it's another poster.  Poster size.  All right, time for Jack Tolber.  All right.  Very happy.  Today is Terry Clifford Day. 
[02:27:30]  No way.  Today?  Yep.  Yep.  Oh, nice.  Which means I will not be able to call Brother Weez for at least a month.  Yeah, he...  He begged me.  He goes, look.  Last time I saw him, he's like, please, just don't do Terry Clifford Day.  And you're like, brah, you know I gotta.  Yeah, I did say brah, I gotta.  Most of the...  He's in the same town as her.  They're in the same circles because it's a small radio market, you know, as far as the shows  and all that.  She really doesn't do much on the Bee Morning Coffee Club. 
[02:28:00]  There's already a link flying past me.  Oh, no.  It's just, they don't waste any time.  She doesn't do that much.  So most of this jocktober is focused around one story that they just went on for hours  about.  Really?  Yeah.  It's, what is it called?  Today's Country?  W-B-E-E.  W-B-E-E, 92.5.  Today's Country out of Rochester, New York.  Uh-huh.  Rochester.  All right.  Here's today's jocktober.  I just received word from the new president of the Livingston County Farm Bureau. 
[02:28:30]  Sent me a note saying that he's got a lot of feedback.  I did a great speech last night, so in your faces.  Oh, good for you.  Oh.  Yeah, that makes me very happy.  As well it should.  And you know what that means?  You'll be doing another one a year from now.  Yeah, that's fine with me, man.  They were great people last night.  I had a really good time.  And I ate about eight pounds of prime rib.  Hey.  Awesome. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, boy.  Wow.  What was that about?  The guy gave a speech and they liked it.  That was doldrums.  That was really bad.  Yeah.  Oh, baby.  Awesome.  Damn.  She thought the ribs were awesome.  Oh, my God.  You got to eat a bunch of ribs and she was like, awesome.  Was that on the radio?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That sounded like it would be something you would just say before the mics went on.  No, right in the morning.  That who gives a shit stuff.  There's some.  All right.  Their Facebook is getting a lot of weird photos on it. 
[02:29:30]  What do you mean?  Like what?  Well, there's one guy with a vacuum cleaner hose attachment.  Well, he's trying to make his dick bigger.  Yeah, he's got the shaft of his dick sucking into the vacuum hose.  Well, how else do you fucking stretch it out there?  There's a picture.  You've got a small one.  Keith the Cop photobombing in a photo frame.  Nice.  A Jocktober approved banner with my face.  A girl holding up a sign that says E-Rock.  Ah.  And making a face.  Oh, there's a cartoon picture of a house with a tree on top of it.  But the tree is growing out of the roof. 
[02:30:00]  Right.  It's like there's a tree on their house.  I got a tree on my house.  See?  That's a tree on the house.  I got a tree on my house.  God, that's disgusting.  Another photo on WBEE Rochester Facebook page.  And this is two women making out, but there's shit between their mouths.  Yeah, there's two Asian women and they're totally making out, but there's shit just squeezing  out from between the lips.  Of course, the classic Game of Thrones guy with a brace yourselves.  Jocktober is coming.  Right.  Yes.  A robot with tank legs and a penis for a nose.  Why? 
[02:30:30]  Oh, Jesus.  What is that?  I don't know, but I don't like it.  Chopped meat coming out of a vagina.  Yeah, it's bad.  Ronald Reagan dice.  Ronald Reagan dice.  What the fuck?  Ronald Reagan dice.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Chip Chibberson.  Jelly or jam, you decide.  Oh, we're still trying to figure that one out.  Sure.  Elect Mayor Goldie Wilson.  Oh, boy.  Happy Jocktober with a dark brown Indian-looking gentleman with a swastika t-shirt.  Sure.  Bob Kelly is a baby.  Coke float in my cup. 
[02:31:00]  Very good.  A lot of stuff going on there on Facebook.  I realize we share the same listeners.  Very strange.  Some crossover.  Well, Terry Clifford tells a story about getting confronted in the makeup aisle.  It's going to be gold.  Yeah.  The nerve of some people.  I have to say that I was stunned.  I was in the makeup aisle yesterday looking for her.  I was stunned.  I was stunned.  I gotta say I was stunned.  As she was telling this story.  She is a beast, right? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  She's a very fat woman.  I had to take my headphones off and ask Travis if Terry Clifford was doing the show just for me.  I realized the story she was telling.  Well, shouldn't the people in the store be stunned that she was in the makeup aisle?  Yeah, really.  That she could fit in the aisle.  Right.  The nerve of some people.  I have to say that I was stunned.  I was in the makeup aisle yesterday looking for a couple things.  And a woman came up to me.  And she was pretty heavily made up herself. 
[02:32:00]  And she was older than I was.  And she says to me, you know, hon, if I were you, you need something to clearly define those eyebrows of yours.  Oh, my God.  Can you believe it?  What the fuck is that?  I thought she was going to tell her to get a face transplant.  I've come a long way with that lately.  And see what's going on in this Facebook wall.  Oh, I didn't even know.  This must be a WBEE ad campaign. 
[02:32:30]  Okay.  Because it's a man with a sheep saying, baby, can we do it in the pooper?  WBEE.  There's a picture of a dolphin with Hitler's head.  And it says, hey, look, a dolphin.  A dolphin.  A dolphin.  Adolph.  Clump, Tony, Kenny, dressed as a disco man.  Well, that would be John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever.  Hey, it's a woman and a horse having sex.  A woman having sex with a horse.  That's great.  A woman having sex with a clown. 
[02:33:00]  Wow.  There's a Troy on my house.  There's a Troy on my house.  And it's Troy Kwan's head on the roof of a house.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  There's a Troy on my house.  It's Anthony with a Nazi field hockey team.  Oh, no.  They're ice hockey.  No, that's a female ice hockey team.  Yes.  But Nazi.  Yeah, that's a real picture.  Oh, Jesus.  A woman with a black penis on her lips.  In her mouth.  Why would you do that?  Oh, it's a great party.  Great party.  I got shit on my radio. 
[02:33:30]  A Scott Shannon quote.  Yeah.  I'll be saying, good luck, bro, pointing a pistol towards the onlooker.  Oh, this was last year's thing.  No, it's a jocktober, but it's everybody with jocks.  There's a me eating out Jim Norton's ass.  Amazing.  Opie smelling a jockstrap and touching himself.  E-Rock very fat.  Yes.  And Anthony, yours.  I'm just nude.  Your penis doesn't fit the jockstrap.  No, no. 
[02:34:00]  The cup is dangling off the head of my immense pecker.  Off the tip.  Yes.  The thing is, this is all on the Facebook page of WBBE.  That's weird, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Why do they allow that from their listeners?  Let's go back to the clip we were playing.  Ron, there's a...  Terry Clifford's in the makeup aisle.  E-Rock's head on a fat woman's body eating some food that says Real Florida BBQ.  Florida BBQ.  BBQ.  BBQ.  You know, hon, if I were you, you need something to clearly define those eyebrows of yours. 
[02:34:30]  First of all, I'd let them fill in a little bit.  They're way too thin.  Yeah.  And then I would paint...  At least something on you is.  It's a Troy on my ass.  And fill in a little bit.  They're way too thin.  Yeah.  And then I would paint the remainder of them in.  And she used this phrase, for such a full face, you need harsher eyebrows.  Now, I've got a problem with two ends of that sentence. 
[02:35:00]  Don't tell me my face is full.  Well, it's your stomach?  Yeah.  He's got a full face.  Face is full.  It is full.  You know what they were trying to say?  You have a full face.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  That's way more polite than a lot of these photos.  And more...  I mean, there's a Troy on my house.  It's been posted many times.  Well, it's a good one.  The Clubasaurus Kenny.  Clubasaurus Kenny. 
[02:35:30]  It's a black woman.  It's Kenny's head on a Brontosaurus body.  It fits.  It looks good.  Pictures of Troy when he was in that band.  Oh.  All gangsta.  Roland with the Energizer bunny ears on that says, don't get the panda angry.  Oh, two erect penises touching each other.  One is a little smaller than the other one.  Yeah.  The other one is kind of bigger.  If you're going to touch penis heads, you've got to make sure they're the same size, right?  Hey, do you have the Tom Hanks thing? 
[02:36:00]  Sure.  Before we go back to Jack Tober, I guess Tom Hanks just cursed on Good Morning America.  It's a big fucking deal.  This thing will be everywhere by tonight.  This is how it went down.  That's a little bit...  Well, if you say it with an accent like that, they won't...  Where was it?  I want people to buy me.  They're fucking...  Oh, I want people to buy me.  We are so sorry.  Hey, good morning, America.  Man, oh man.  I'm sorry.  I slipped into a brand of acting.  I have never done that before. 
[02:36:30]  I would apologize to the kids in America that are watching this right now.  And let me say next time on the show, there will be a seven second delay.  Oh, boy.  They're so sorry.  Oh, God.  They're so sorry.  They're freaking out.  They're freaking out.  How sorry are you?  Oh, God.  On the same note, there's a picture on WBEE's Facebook page.  It's a man with his face blown off.  Oh, that's terrible.  Right above that is a picture of Roland right before he passes out that says, Mexican. 
[02:37:00]  Mexican.  M-E-S-S-I-C-A-N.  But it's Mets.  Mexican.  Mexican.  He does say Mexican.  Mexican.  Mexican.  Mexican.  Mexican.  So why do we give a fuck that people say curse words on TV still?  Does anyone care?  Who cares in the end?  Who's really getting hurt here?  The children.  They completely panicked.  They did.  Back to Jocktober, WBEE in Rochester, New York.  The Bee Morning Coffee Club with Steve Newman and Terry Clifford. 
[02:37:30]  Terry talks about how stunned she was.  Same story?  Same story.  With the full face?  With the full face.  In the makeup aisle?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Now, was this like a Wigman's employee?  No.  Were they like featuring makeup or something?  Yeah.  Or was it just a...  Are you kidding?  They can't feature anything in that store.  It's so crowded.  Good grief.  It was just a random shopper unsolicitedly started to throw her two cents.  Oh, my God.  And gave her to makeover.  I was stunned.  I was...  First of all... 
[02:38:00]  She sounds fat.  How are you stunned by that?  She just sounds fat.  Huh?  Her voice sounds fat.  Doesn't it?  She's got a fat-sounding voice.  Yeah, of course.  You know what's more stunning than that scenario?  Huh?  A rhino projectile shitting on their Facebook page.  Now, there you go.  Now I'm stunned.  That's great.  But if you're a big gal, how are you stunned that someone references your full face?  Your full face.  How are you stunned by that?  You're lucky they said full.  Makeover. 
[02:38:30]  I was stunned.  I was...  First of all...  I was silent.  I looked at her.  I went...  I mean, my mouth was open.  Yeah, because you're eating.  I went, well, thanks for the advice.  I didn't know what to say.  Because I wanted to say, how freaking rude.  Yeah.  But I wasn't going to say that.  You don't think people notice your fat face?  I would not say that.  Why wouldn't you say that if she's...  I would so say that.  Someone takes a shot at you in public and you're...  Yeah.  Don't you go right back at them? 
[02:39:00]  These folks are getting resourceful.  There's a picture of a very young, svelte, sexy Opie with his brother in front of the  Magic Castle there in Disney World.  Holy fuck.  Where did they find that one?  I don't know, but you are looking like a million bucks.  Where did that one come from?  Wow.  Sleeveless shirt?  No, it's not sleeveless.  I used to roll up the sleeves so I could get an even tan.  Even cooler.  Yeah.  Good point, Travis.  Even cooler.  Oh my God.  That's a horrendous photo. 
[02:39:30]  That doesn't look like the Magic Kingdom Castle.  It is, though.  It is.  I went down there...  It's weird.  It's off to the side.  Yeah, the side view.  I went down there with my brother many, many years ago.  Wow.  Where the fuck do they find that picture?  Flowing blonde locks.  That was before I met Ed.  Wow.  That long ago?  About.  Jesus.  Why know why you're at Disney World?  About, I think.  Huh?  This guy is at Disney World because this guy knows how much young pussy there is at Disney  That's right.  That's right, Sam.  Yeah.  Tell him. 
[02:40:00]  By the way, I'm getting word that Phase 4 could be complete.  Well, we didn't even hit Phase 1 yet, so let's see.  Let me click the old reload and...  I'm hearing Phase...  We're in the process of reloading.  We go straight to Phase 4 today.  Phase 4 is complete.  What's Phase 4 again?  Complete shutdown?  It's complete shutdown.  It went from Phase 0 to Phase 4 immediately.  No, just take the fucking pictures down.  No, nothing. 
[02:40:30]  That's it.  Oh, and Terry Clifford has shut down her personal face.  We didn't even get a chance to look at that one.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  Oh, that's a shame.  Is Brother Weez on vacation this week?  I hope he is.  Oh, wait.  I don't want to deal with this today.  I clicked on Steve Hossman, who's the guy on WBE.  And under Friends, he's got two.  And one is a guy named Mark, and the other is Brother Weez.  Oh, no.  Oh, fuck.  Your radio mentor, Opie. 
[02:41:00]  What does he look like?  He's right there.  He's not Weez.  The other guy, yeah.  I don't see any pictures, really.  Voice sound a little familiar, and I'm not even...  Oh.  Do you know this guy?  He's got an iPad.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's trying to be a hipster.  He used to work with Weez.  What else does he have?  Yeah, he used to work with Weez.  So did you.  And look what's happened.  I've actually done radio with that guy when I visit Rochester.  He used to be on Weez's show.  You like him?  Yeah, he's all right.  He's no Terry Clifford.  No.  All right, moving on. 
[02:41:30]  I want to wear a wrestling knee pad.  Okay.  And I'm thinking a brooch.  A big spider brooch.  Go with the hipster bits, don't you?  Yeah, hipsters have to wear two really odd things.  And then they fit in.  And then no one questions anything.  No one questions it.  You're a hipster, man.  Yeah, I probably wouldn't notice if you did that.  No, why would you?  I'm just being cool like you, everyone else.  Exactly.  Here in Williamsburg.  All right, why don't we go back to... 
[02:42:00]  The Bee Morning Coffee Club.  Starring Terry Clifford.  Starring.  Last we left you, she was in some kind of makeup aisle in Wegmans.  In Dullsville.  And someone said that she has a full face and she should do a few things.  Look at her picture.  And she was absolutely stunned that someone would actually reference her as having a full face.  She does have a full face.  And when you're discussing makeup, I would gather that the size and shape 
[02:42:30]  of your face is important.  And I've heard about these people that are so nice, they will not go back at you.  Yeah.  Even though that person is insulting you.  I've heard people are that nice where they can control themselves.  Sure.  They said it would be rude to talk back to her.  That's rude.  After this lady said she had a full face.  Full face.  All right.  Let's see how this concludes.  And here's Boone's favorite saying, and he used it again on me last night.  You gotta stop being such a welcome man.  Oh, and that aggravates me when he says that.  Oh. 
[02:43:00]  But I just was stunned that someone would say that to someone they don't even know.  And secondly.  Why?  It's our whole job to make you look better.  Right.  So they gotta tell you.  That's what those makeup girls do.  You're an idiot.  If there's something to compliment, they will compliment you.  But if there's nothing to compliment you with, they'll go with the full fucking face.  They'll say, look.  Look at her face.  Holy shit.  She has a fucking Andre the Giant face.  Her eyes are a little too far apart.  Oh, my God.  Is she the weirdest looking thing?  And she's wearing a tag that says Big Easy. 
[02:43:30]  Big Easy.  That's who she is.  Oh, God.  Oh, is she terrible?  Is that a full face?  Yeah, that's a full fucking face.  You would swear that's a guy.  Yep.  You would swear.  You would go, that's a guy.  Holy fuck.  You think that's the type of remark that hurts her feelings when she talks to Brother Lee?  Shit.  Oh, God.  How do I do this?  I like going to Rochester.  Oh, man.  It's just a matter of time before I run into her.  I can't wait.  I didn't have to play that part where I didn't mean it and all that shit.  But you did. 
[02:44:00]  You meant all of it.  I mean every single fucking word.  Weasel would be like, Terry, this is Opie.  Oh, you.  Oh, now you.  Oh, Terry.  It's just for the radio.  You've been mean to me.  No.  You've been.  No, no.  You have.  Tell you the truth.  Listen to the tape.  It was all Anthony.  Yeah, that's it.  I've used that one before.  Oh, fuck yeah.  You got to.  That's the best part about having a radio duo.  You're able to blame the other party for everything.  It gets you out of a lot of jams.  I really had nothing to do with that one, Terry Clifford. 
[02:44:30]  He's obsessed with making fun of fat people.  I try to stop him.  If you listen to the show, you'll hear.  I'm a big fan.  I kept stopping the audio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I kept.  Exactly.  All right.  Well, let's get back into Terry Clifford being stunned, amazed, all sorts of shit.  Yeah.  Terry Clifford.  Someone's monitoring and saying the show has not talked since this whole thing started.  Oh, boy.  Why?  Do your show.  I don't know.  They get very upset. 
[02:45:00]  They go into battle mode.  They just shut down, patten down the hatches.  And secondly, my eyebrows look fine.  I get them done professionally once a month.  Why bother?  I mean, honestly, why fucking bother with, I don't understand, fatties.  It's the people like ourselves that are borderline good looking.  You got to take care of your shit.  Yeah.  But if you're in the sub borderline good looking category, why bother?  You're absolutely right. 
[02:45:30]  Why bother?  No one's going to look and go, wow.  Her eyebrows.  Her eyebrows.  I thought you were a two, but now that you got your eyebrows done, I'm going to give you a three.  And the retard bangs ain't cutting it.  They really are just too high and short.  It must be helpful today.  Yeah, we're being helpful.  This is helpful.  The perm is way too tight.  The perm's too tight.  Unless that's your natural hair.  If it is, then grow it out.  Get those curls a little looser.  The bangs that go completely straight across your forehead, four inches above your eyes. 
[02:46:00]  Way too high.  It's not happening.  Okay?  She does not have one redeeming quality.  Could someone Photoshop all our faces into her hair?  How do we do that?  Before we work on the hair too much, how about she loses two people worth of weight?  Right.  That's the biggest thing is her.  Oh, guys.  The biggest.  We got to have her lose some weight.  Honestly, if you don't want people to notice your full face.  Throw a neck?  No. 
[02:46:30]  Get some breast implants.  Oh, she is a flatso.  Guys like looking at titties.  She's a flatso.  Show some cleavage.  They'll leave your face alone.  I don't know what to do with the linebacker back.  I always assume fat people can just open the closet and just grab anything and put it  on and not look.  Because they don't have to worry about looking good.  They can just put on fucking a gunny sack and go to work or something.  Because no one's going to look and go, oh, she fucking looks great in that.  That must be freeing. 
[02:47:00]  Let's ask E-Rock.  Is that why he's wearing a Skeletor shirt?  Well, it's the flow chart.  I can't help it.  I was going to say so.  I don't make the rules.  There's an E-Rock flow chart around here.  Right.  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup.  Jesus.  The hair is just too tight.  That's terrible.  The bangs are too high.  She does have nice eyebrows, though.  Sexy.  They are terrific.  Give her those eyebrows.  Nice arch.  Nice little arch to them. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Nice punching targets.  Her ears are, like, in her head.  Yeah, yeah.  She's got those inny ear lobes.  Where her head is just naturally trying to consume them.  Yeah.  Like a fucking sign that's too close to a tree after, like, 25 years.  It just starts eating the sign.  That's what her ears...  Her head is eating her ears.  Yes.  There's an earring that's, like, getting engulfed.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  All right.  Let's continue with this clip. 
[02:48:00]  Her in the makeup aisle at Wegmans.  Secondly, my eyebrows look fine.  I get them done professionally once a month.  Well, now you said that she was a little made up with...  Thank you.  Thank you.  There's a guy that was almost honest.  Almost.  He's like...  He wanted to say right there, you're delusional.  He was a split second away from honesty.  Yes, and then had a bell.  And a giant blowout.  Because the show doesn't say starring whoever this guy's name is.  It's starring Terry Clifford.  She should turn her... 
[02:48:30]  She should twist her ear and have Arnold's head in there.  She really has a big, fat head.  It's Terry Clifford's Morning Coffee Club with the others.  With the others.  Terry Clifford is the marquee performer here.  Does she dress up as the two weeks broad for Halloween?  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Can we do the two weeks?  Yeah, fat head.  Can you find that picture?  Split screen it?  Yeah.  Very similar. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, she does have that fat head.  Well, now you said that she was a little made up herself.  Why didn't you just come back at her and say,  Well, what about your look?  Well, because I don't want to be confrontational  and get in a fight in the middle of the aisle at Wegmans.  She said, what tribe are you in?  Wegmans.  See?  Believe me.  I could have come up with enough zingers, but I just...  But you didn't, so shut up.  I hate these people.  Could have.  You either do it or you don't.  Could have.  That could have shit sucks.  Oh, God.  I could have, really?  It's the same broad. 
[02:49:30]  It really is.  That's the same broad.  Oh, God.  It's the same broad.  Oh, that's frightening.  See, but the two weeks broad has the longer hair.  See how it kind of softens her look a little bit?  Two weeks.  She's got a very big head.  It covers up the ears that are being swallowed by the skull.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  She was scary.  All right.  Let's see.  We've got the two weeks broad on our screen.  Now, let's...  Oh, God.  I can't...  Oh, you. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  There it is.  That's good.  That works.  All right.  Come on, Sam.  That works.  Come on.  There you go.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can see it.  There's some similarities there.  Definitely.  Oh, God.  Islet Wegmans.  She said, what tribe are you in?  See?  Believe me.  I could have come up with enough zingers, but I just wouldn't do it.  Oh, my word.  I was stunned.  I was absolutely stunned.  And then I got so mad at myself.  Because I was so stunned, I just got in the aisle, paid for my stuff, and left. 
[02:50:30]  I never even bought what I was after.  So, as a result today, I'm not totally made up.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  No one noticed.  Thank God you said that.  No one noticed.  No one cared that you're not made up.  Sorry.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Oldie time deep sea diving helmet plus tap shoes equals Williamsburg hipster.  And then you just meet your friends, like, in front of one of the Asian fucking restaurants 
[02:51:00]  in Williamsburg, and you're having a great time.  Sure.  Yeah.  Sam wrote this, because I'm going to have to deal with Wheeze eventually about this.  Sam writes, more on this dumb lady.  I want to get back at her on your behalf.  Actually, I want you to get back at her.  But I shouldn't live that way.  That's not a nice way to live.  Well.  You think you could have taken her?  Oh, yeah.  When you came down to it?  Yeah.  Yeah, duh.  Look at me. 
[02:51:30]  I could have sat on her.  You think you could have taken her?  You're saying nobody...  She could take half the fucking guys in Rochester.  Nobody notices whether she's made up or not when she has to sit on two desk chairs to broadcast  next to each other.  Get the ones without the arms on them.  That's not a nice way to live.  Well.  You think you could have taken her?  Like if it came down to it?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Would you hit her first in the stomach or go right for the jaw?  Yeah.  How would you do that? 
[02:52:00]  I've never considered that.  I don't know.  Or just a quick kick.  I probably would have just, you know, cut her down to size with my word.  You know what I'm saying?  You're fantasizing.  Tell the people you'd punch her in the fucking face.  I gotta tell you.  That clip made me think of something.  That's how Fez would sound if he had a sex change.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  How do you know?  Huh?  How do you know?  I don't know.  I just had a visual. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, why do you say this?  If Fez had a sex change, no one else heard that?  He had a rough day the other day.  Look, just the last part.  Just the last part.  Maybe we should just.  I want to get back at her.  Hold on.  Last part, though.  Humor me.  Didn't he have a tough day the other day?  Yeah, how would you do that?  I never considered that.  I don't know.  Or just a quick kick.  I probably would have just, you know, cut her down to size with my word.  You hear it.  Oh, no.  You hear it.  You hear it. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, no.  You hear it, though.  There's something there.  If there was some hormones introduced that would raise the voice a little, let me hear  it again.  I knew you would hear it.  I know.  I knew you would hear it.  Oh, no.  Yeah, how would you do that?  I've never considered that.  I don't know.  Or just a quick kick.  I probably would have just, you know, cut her down to size with my word.  I'm saying if he had a sex change, that's not going to happen, so he should be all right 
[02:53:30]  with that, right?  It's a standalone fruit.  You know.  You know.  Fez did have a rough day because he was upset that yesterday.  Yeah.  Chris Stanley had, when he brought in the clips of you and Jimmy talking about intern  Dana.  Oh, right.  He also included the clip of Opie asking who talks more, Fez or Dana.  Oh, no.  And the answer coming in.  That's what got him going?  Yeah, because, I mean, it was indeed. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, fuck.  I'm sorry, Fez.  Oh.  But no, I mean.  You shouldn't apologize because Sam's the one that said Dana talks more.  She does.  I was just asking the question.  She does.  What happened there on the show when they brought in the audio of Jimmy calling her a midget and  shit?  Dana wasn't in yesterday.  Oh.  But I heard she shut down her Facebook.  Really?  Which apparently she developed quite an ego over.  Oh.  Iraq got something on that?  After the first clip, there was just this long pause and Ron hits the console and goes,  what took them so long? 
[02:54:30]  Fucking Ronnie.  Ronnie rolls.  That's good.  I believe he said he could listen to it all day.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  That's great.  And Jimmy fucking flew off on her, man.  Midget.  Oh.  Fucking.  You're an average Jane five.  Oh, Jesus.  I gotta say.  Maybe I'm getting soft because now I'm a father or two.  Terry Clifford sounds like just a nice lady.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[02:55:00]  She just sounds like a nice lady.  Was that before or after you commented on her retard bangs?  I didn't say retard bangs.  I said retard bangs.  But then Opie said we should Photoshop all our faces into her hair.  That would be a good carnival game.  That would be fun.  And then said as if it were.  Could someone do that?  And then said as if it were factual, not a joke.  Let's all be honest.  Terry Clifford looks like a man.  What's the matter?  What happens when you leave the studio home? 
[02:55:30]  No, no.  You got a little.  It's when I go to Rochester.  I gotta deal with.  Oh, okay.  So that's.  Oh, all right.  I'm fine with you.  You're just covering for the next trip to Rochester.  I could just hear that she's a nice lady, though.  Is she?  Yeah, man.  Oh, I would just get her.  She allows people to basically say.  With my words.  To tell.  To point out her fatness right in front of her.  And she doesn't even respond.  Yeah.  She is a fat lady, though.  That takes a special person.  She is a big fat lady.  I bet she does a lot for the community.  I bet she does.  And charity.  Yeah, but E-Rock works for you.  And you call him fat.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:56:00]  That's true.  Good point.  You know?  Yeah, but E-Rock's like, you know, fat.  I bet if she.  I bet if she did Jocktober.  And goofed on a radio station.  They could never say.  Well, I bet she doesn't do anything for the community.  Right.  Because I bet she does.  A lot.  Yeah, she shopped at Wegmans.  That's doing something.  I bet she's very community active.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know if she's active.  But she does a lot for the community.  She probably sits around a lot.  Doesn't do much.  Active.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, you see, she's so overweight. 
[02:56:30]  Well, I think.  I think she did it to herself, though.  Why would she bring that story to the show?  That's why I told Travis about why on all days.  The day that I'm recording you is the day that you're bringing up the fact that somebody  came up to you.  A stranger came up to you and said, you have a very full face.  Why would you do that?  Terry Clifford?  Learn.  Like, you're not a good looking woman.  But you probably have other qualities that are nice.  Can you imagine what this is doing to her?  If she got so flustered at Wegmans that she didn't even end up buying what she wanted? 
[02:57:00]  Right.  Just because of that one little comment?  I mean, God bless her for trying and all.  And then you could hear the guys.  They're like, are you really telling this story to us?  Do you think that they all know how fat she is?  Yes!  Yeah, I bet they do.  The one guy paused because he wanted to say, you're delusional.  Of course.  Of course you should say that.  Yeah.  You have a full face.  It's full of cake.  It's full of roast beef.  It's full of whatever you can get your hands on.  Whatever you can shove in it.  She's probably trying, though. 
[02:57:30]  Oh.  Listen, we've been following Terry Clifford for five years.  We've done five?  Yes.  She was there for the first October.  Wow.  And?  She's been fat ever since.  Yeah.  The Twitter's now down.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What happened?  And supposedly they haven't gone live in ten minutes.  Oh.  She's probably crying.  You made her cry, Opie?  I hope not.  Last time she cried.  There were tears, right?  And then she'd have to wipe her tears and go back on the air and do that show. 
[02:58:00]  Because that's the kind of professional she is.  Wait, she said that?  Right?  I think that was another person.  Oh, I thought it was her.  No.  Oh, well then, fuck it.  Just another casualty left in the wake of Jocktober.  Yeah.  Let's take a look.  Hang on.  But if we've done it five years in a row, she must know it's coming.  She's the queen of Jocktober.  Put it on your calendar.  She thought maybe this time she'd made it through.  Because it was kind of late in October.  We only got another like week and a half. 
[02:58:30]  And plus, Opie had been, you know, she knew.  She talked to Weez and said, hey, tell your boy.  Weez was campaigning for her hard, man.  In the middle of the summer, by the way, I'm up in Rochester having a good time.  And he goes, hey, brah.  Terry Clifford's a really nice lady, brah.  I see her all the time at Wigman's.  We go to the same restaurants, brah.  He sees her in Wigman's?  All that shit.  He goes, please.  I mean, he's the one who said it.  I go, I don't even know.  I go, that's months away.  I don't even know what we're going to do this year.  Relax.  Did he say she had a full face?  Is he the one?  Oh, no.  He never said it. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, my God.  What?  Jocktober 2012 is the Twitter name for this person.  Oh.  It's got a picture of you guys, but I don't think you have anything to do with it.  Because this person on Twitter just wrote, at Terry WBEE is a fat cunt who should die  of AIDS.  Oh, Jesus.  Of the cancer of the AIDS.  Which is just like.  That's terrible.  Terrible.  I mean, die of AIDS of the cancer of the AIDS is just such a terrible way to go. 
[02:59:30]  What does that even mean?  Oh, man.  Why would you even read that one?  I know.  That's really bad.  And I'm not even saying that so you read more.  I'm like, why would you read that one?  Just to tell you what's going on.  I had to shut down my Facebook wall.  Hashtag fat lady tweets.  Come on.  Terry Schiavo, greater sign, Terry WBEE.  Well, she got that big check for all the bullying, right?  Terry Clifford?  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  No, I think.  What?  No.  I'll be confused.  That was Rochester.  That was her.  That was Terry.  What?  That was a bus monitor.  That was a large, dumb, fat woman.  Oh, shit.  I thought it was the same person.  Yeah.  No, that wasn't.  Oh, I thought like.  The kids weren't making fun of her?  I thought in the end she did well because she got the big check.  Yeah.  No, that wasn't her.  That was her.  Oh, look.  She has pictures where she's doing all this nice stuff in the community.  Doing good stuff for the community.  Oh.  Like we don't do, ever.  She went to Goodwill.  We don't care about the community.  We don't care about the community.  At all. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, not in the least.  She's as big as those two people together.  So big.  And those two people are fat.  Yeah.  They're also flat-sos.  And she wears sensible clothes.  She just wants to wake up.  She wakes up happy in the morning.  In a good mood.  Ready to put on a good show.  With her Andre the Giant hair.  She dresses like someone working in a hardware store.  Just trying to find out if anybody wants a peanut.  She's terrible.  Pulling up to the studio with four white horses.  Yeah. 
[03:01:00]  Are we done?  I think we're done.  This was uncomfortable, this one.  Well, for you.  I didn't feel good about this one.  Yeah.  Just blame it on the show.  No, you shouldn't.  Blame it on the rest of the show.  It's just a show, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Let's see.  Yeah, okay.  Obama and Mitt Romney told jokes last night at the Al Smith dinner.  They told some jokes.  We're going to go to break with Obama making fun of himself here.  A little bit.  And we'll wrap up next. 
[03:01:30]  Stay there.  Ultimately, though, tonight's not about the disagreements Governor Romney and I may have.  It's what we have in common, beginning with our unusual names.  Actually, Mitt is his middle name.  I wish I could use my middle name.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  It's not the same like it was. 
[03:02:00]  Erectile dysfunction has become a serious epidemic.  Pussy is over.  Don't mean nothing no more.  I can't get a hard on.  Take it from legendary comedian and ED sufferer Pat Cooper.  It's no joke.  I'm not making this shit up.  You're with that gorgeous muffa and you're in bed and it don't happen.  Happened to me.  And she goes, what's the matter?  I said, I think it's erectile dysfunction.  She goes, what's that?  I'm fucking dead.  She goes, you mean you can't get it up?  Medication isn't the only option. 
[03:02:30]  I tried Cialis.  I tried Viagra.  I tried everything.  I'm fucking dead.  If you or someone you know is suffering from erectile dysfunction, contact your physician to explore alternative medical treatments.  I swear to you, I went to a urologist.  He says, how do you feel?  I said, my big thrill is peeing.  I said, when I was getting laid, I used to go, ah, ah.  Now that I pee, I go, ah, ah, ah.  It's the same fucking thing.  It wouldn't have cost me a dime.  Just take it from Pat Cooper.  Don't buy into the erectile dysfunction hype. 
[03:03:00]  Fuck all the bullshit.  Your penis no longer works.  Life as you know it is over.  The doctor said to me, you're fucking dead.  I'm fucking dead.  New from Puddin' Head Records, Opie and Anthony present,  Sittin' and Singin', the Handicap Hits.  Oi, rollin' with the devil.  Ah, ah, ah.  Yes, I'm rollin'.  Ah, ah, ah.  It's all the rock you know and love, done specifically for people without leg mobility. 
[03:03:30]  Cause traps like us, baby, we were born to roll.  Just because your legs don't work, doesn't mean your ears don't.  Just ask Van Halen.  Oi, I wish I could jump.  I'm never gonna jump.  Might as well just sit here.  The hits just keep rollin' in.  If only they could walk.  Ah, yes.  I would roll one hundred miles and I would roll five hundred more.  But my hands would hurt cause I'm rollin', get it? 
[03:04:00]  I sit in the chair that you're in.  Now face north.  Roll around 90 degrees and still just sit here.  It's sittin' and singin' the Handicap Hits.  From your pals at Puddin' Head Records and The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  This, this is The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's almost time to go, ohm.  It's almost time to go, oh, oh, ohm.  It's almost time to go home. 
[03:04:30]  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  It's almost time to go home.  Anthony has left the show.  We had a huge argument over the Terry Clifford thing.  He didn't like it.  No, I didn't like it. 
[03:05:00]  Way to fuck up my bit.  I knew what you were going to do.  This is why we can't do radio together.  You don't know where I'm going.  I was the guy this time that was going to be the guy that had a problem with it.  No, you just want to make it easier for you next time you're in Rochester.  I don't want you getting there.  No.  So I'm going to slam the brakes on.  Do you really want to know how I feel?  How do you feel?  I feel a little bad about this one.  You do?  They haven't talked in like 15 minutes.  You know, you told me to do Terry Clifford every day for the last...  I know. 
[03:05:30]  Now I feel...  And next year, you're just going to want me to do it again.  I don't feel too good about myself on this one.  You should feel all right about yourself because you provided so much entertainment.  But then again, why would she talk about that on her show?  So it's her fault.  Well, I've got to blame somebody.  I can't take the blame myself ever.  Back already?  Yeah.  I decided that piss turned into a dump.  I tried to do a bit with Sam and he fucked it up.  Oh, Sam.  Yeah, but I fucked it up on purpose.  You know how we don't discuss stuff sometimes and I'll just go with something and you go, 
[03:06:00]  Oh, I know where he's going.  Yeah.  Not Sam.  I go, we had a huge fight over the Terry Clifford thing and he goes, yeah, Ant didn't like it.  I would be the one that would have a problem with this.  Of course you would, but I went the unexpected route.  No, now you're trying to spin it because you want to fucking...  Sam.  ...feel like you did something wrong.  You were far more predictable.  I knew where you were going.  Sam, you were the problem.  And I veered far off the road.  The hell...  And I don't feel good about the Terry Clifford one. 
[03:06:30]  Roll it and give me...  Uh, Oliver Stone's new movie.  Oh, okay.  I don't feel good about the Terry Clifford one.  No?  Not really.  Are you going to...  Are you going to cut this part and put it on your phone so you can play it for weeks?  I don't feel good about...  See, this is what I did.  ...Terry Clifford...  Nah, I mean, there's someone monitoring the station.  They haven't talked in like 15 minutes.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  She's probably very upset, right?  Yeah, but she was the one talking about makeup and a lady saying that she had a full face. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, that's worthy of just being slammed.  Sure, why not?  Just slam the shit out of her.  Because she had some woman say her face was fucking full.  So take that and run with it.  Yeah, we just are horrible people.  I just...  Yeah, but if...  If it was some like, I don't know, she went to like pick pumpkins or something, it wouldn't have been as brutal.  No, we'd have talked about how the pumpkins looked like her big fat head. 
[03:07:30]  Or that she entered herself in the giant pumpkin contest.  Yeah, exactly.  You're right.  I'm sure no matter what she talked about...  All right, give me another one.  Let's see if we can steer clear of fat jokes.  All right.  What's something radio people talk about?  Boring radio people.  Like they would talk about going to a pumpkin farm.  Leaf peeping.  Oh, like fucking looking at the colors of the foliage.  Leaf peeping.  All right.  Right, right. 
[03:08:00]  Did cars pull over when you were looking at the leaves because they thought they saw a moose?  See?  See?  Well, that happens.  If you go to New Hampshire, all of a sudden the cars all pull over because they see a moose.  Yeah, yeah.  They see a moose.  All right, give me another one.  Well, there is...  Halloween's coming up.  Yeah, maybe like your favorite trick-or-treat costume.  I was going to say candy.  Too easy.  No, no.  Too easy.  Trick-or-treat kosh.  Yes, yes.  She would have been pretty safe there, I think.  Yeah.  Oh, sure. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, there's really nothing you can do about, you know...  Nope.  Dressing up as Hulk.  Stay Puppy Marshmallow Man.  Right?  Things like that.  Right.  Dressing up as the world.  Yes.  Just put a fucking...  Just put a map.  Wear a map shirt.  All right, we failed on that one.  Give me another one.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Well, a lot of...  We could always go back to the favorite breakfast cereal bit.  Yeah.  And cereals are not, you know...  Everybody eats cereal.  That's fine.  Exactly. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Just not in such large quantities.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think finally, if they talked about cereals, it wouldn't have been as bad.  That wouldn't have been bad at all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  We found one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you gotta talk about how a lady said she had a full face and a makeup aisle.  What?  I mean, Terry, please!  What were we supposed to do?  Full face.  Fuck!  What are you gonna do?  What are you gonna do?  Worst song ever?  Worst song ever.  Making the rounds on the YouTube.  On the YouTube. 
[03:09:30]  Tizzit.  I don't know.  Tizzit.  It's called Wilder by Geniza.  Geniza?  Geniza.  Is she a black woman?  No.  Oh.  Geniza's white?  Let's see Geniza.  She's trying to, like...  What does she look like?  Ah, like...  She looks like...  Oh, an advertisement.  Oh, you could skip it.  Skip ass!  What are you doing?  Skip ass.  Skip ass.  She's trying to look like Kim Kardashian a little bit, I guess.  Oh, right.  She's terrible. 
[03:10:00]  I've seen her.  Yeah.  Does anyone know what this is about?  I think it's about somebody trying to get Rebecca Black hits.  Oh, really?  Because it's professionally shot.  It's a professional video.  She's so off-key, it's crazy.  That's good eye makeup.  Nice eyebrows.  Her face isn't full.  Did you see...  I'm bored with this.  She looks hot in that fucking outfit.  That red thing, I think, a little bit.  Slutty.  I think it was on Break.com.  Did you see the mother-daughter white trash couple there? 
[03:10:30]  What were they doing?  I don't know.  The daughter's, like, talking into her...  Didn't you just give me this?  There's two?  It's two days.  Oh, it's not a movie.  What is this?  It's a 12-part documentary from Oliver Stone.  12 parts?  It's longer than 12 parts.  About what?  That's just two.  What's it a doc on?  The Untold History of the United States.  Oh.  Untold History of the United States.  I don't know.  I like... 
[03:11:00]  Do you understand what my life has become?  Do you understand, Roland?  I don't have time for a 12-part documentary.  Who does?  When the little fellas are asleep, just watch.  Oh, when is that?  I don't know.  I liked Sam's description of how Roland talks and why he can't be understood.  Yeah.  He just mumbles and rambles and stretches words into words, and then at the end, it's a real  word.  Yeah.  So that's how you can understand him.  Like, I'll throw something in the middle you can understand and end strong with a real 
[03:11:30]  word.  Right.  Right.  And then you just put the pieces together, the context of the conversation.  And you can figure it out.  Right.  Thank you, because now I might be able to understand I'm on the drive home.  Right.  Because when you're talking, and I don't think I'm alone, a lot of people listening  are like, I don't know what the fuck Roland is saying.  It's very hard.  I've got to do a better job of repeating him and clarifying.  Yes.  Jets beat the Pats this weekend there, Roland.  You're wearing the Jets shirt.  Yeah.  I can see.  Hopefully.  He's self-conscious about talking now. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Oh, Roland, I'm sorry.  Could you find this video?  It's this...  I think Tebow's supposed to be the wide receiver now.  No.  He's going to take some snaps and maybe run the ball a little bit.  Really?  Yeah, because we're hurting in that position.  Why is Tebow so big and popular if he can't play?  The Jesus.  It just seems like he's not good.  No.  He was made for college football, which is a very different game.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  In the NFL, you've got to know how to throw the fucking ball. 
[03:12:30]  Interesting.  And you can get away with not being able to throw the ball that well in college football.  That's the basics of it, really.  Did you find the video?  No.  People know what I'm talking about.  It's like this...  It's a redneck mother-daughter.  And the daughter's trying to trash someone that maybe trashed her.  She's talking into her camera.  And the mom's in the background piping in.  And the daughter there is talking about all the people that have died in her life. 
[03:13:00]  And it's just fucked up.  You don't see it?  No.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, boy.  Another thing I should have favorited.  You know who'd have found it?  D-R.  It's initials are.  Somebody has it.  D-R.  Come on.  Someone has it.  Somebody just tweet it.  Let's see if they've tweeted it.  First person that tweets it gets some promotion today.  And packaged toast.  And packaged toast.  Big prize. 
[03:13:30]  Flammable toast.  That fucking toast is like wood.  Like fucking...  Like kindling.  Well, no one's tweeting it because we're on a delay.  So now you've got to hear this part.  Come on.  Come on.  Who has it?  Did you go to break.com?  Yeah, but didn't you say it was there a few days ago?  Well, go down a page or two.  I've been scrolling through.  Oh, you have been?  Yeah.  Oh, come on, man.  This one was viral.  This was some viral shit. 
[03:14:00]  Oh.  You saw the weatherman boner guy, right?  Yeah, that is.  Fred from Brooklyn fucking turned me on to that one.  That was pretty funny.  Yeah.  This is overtime, people.  Yeah, I got to go fucking...  I just wanted to show you this real fast.  I got to go press some fucking iron there.  I got to lift some weights.  Actually, it's legs and lower half today.  Oh.  Red...  Oh, thank you, Zach.  Redneck rage on break.  On YouTube.  What do you got? 
[03:14:30]  Oh, an advertisement.  This isn't it.  We got crushed, dude.  Skip the ad.  You can skip it now.  Yeah, this...  Hold on.  Pause.  How can I be thankful?  Pause.  Have you seen these two?  No.  Okay, ready for this?  Look at the mother's tits behind her.  She's sitting down.  They are drooping down to her belt line.  This is the only reason we're staying late, because you need to see them.  This is fantastic.  I don't even know what this is.  She's pissed at someone, so she's fucking on her webcam.  All right.  And the mom's in the background sitting on a chair with her droopy tits. 
[03:15:00]  And I like the authentic wood paneling.  Yeah.  On the walls.  Looks good.  Redneck Rage, it's called.  How can I be fake, Ellie Kane, if that's your real fucking name?  All the pictures are just of me.  All the videos are just of me and my mom, Cindy.  You see that lady right there sitting behind me?  That's my mom, Cindy.  So see, I am not fake, you ugly-looking bitch.  Talk, Cindy.  Yeah, you ugly monkey.  Go climb on another train and jump up on the other side. 
[03:15:30]  It's Chip.  Next time, if you harass my daughter, she will get you on harassment.  One, I am pregnant with my son, Frederick Jr.  Yeah.  I'll be five months tomorrow, and he's kicking the shit out of me right now.  Yeah.  My dad died three weeks ago tomorrow at 6, 18 a.m.  Yeah.  My husband's real.  He's in the living room watching TV.  He doesn't like drama.  The only thing I'd delete him in the first playoff, my fucking count.  Right.  But I haven't run into my family pain.  Yeah.  You moron.  In the 2000s, back in 2000s, I was 12 years old turning 13. 
[03:16:00]  2005, I was 19 turning 20.  I was born in 1986.  I should know how old I was and all them stupid pictures of me.  Since they're my fucking pictures.  Yeah.  This is not a wig.  It's fucking real.  If it was a wig, it would fucking come off right about now.  Yeah.  I died of black.  You like my shirt?  It says Mount Vernon because that's where I actually live. 
[03:16:30]  Hometown.  I lied.  I lied in Springfield when I didn't.  My brothers, Jackson and Daniel, they're fucking dead also.  Daniel was my twin in case you guys didn't know.  He died at three days old.  A smallpox.  We both had it.  He died and I survived.  My brother Jackson died at the age of 27.  In a car wreck.  Last year.  On his birthday.  This year, August 2nd, he'd be 28.  My sister Lucy is not fake either. 
[03:17:00]  She's real.  And she turned 14 October 14th.  Well, she'd be 15 this October.  Yeah, I thought she went on a camping trip.  Leave her alone.  And then you need my family alone also.  You fucking moron.  She got the hiccups.  Oh, and my Aunt Donna, my Grandma's Millie Staley, and my Aunt Margaret, them dead pictures of them, well, they are dead also, and they're not fake.  I should know. 
[03:17:30]  I was in their rooms when they died.  Yeah, and I was too.  This is great.  But we don't like a kisser ass.  So wait till my son turns a year old, me and my husband will be pregnant again.  Yes, I am 24.  She's 53.  And she is not 80.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So if you don't like a KMA.  By the way, she does wear fucking bra.  She has one on right now. 
[03:18:00]  I don't have one right now.  Oh, God.  She flashed a bra.  I don't have one right now because I don't sleep with the bra on at night.  Let's see anything else.  Oh, if he is too alive, he's not dead.  No, I did not run him over.  She's making faces.  So Ellie Keene, how am I helping not edit out my voice?  I don't know how to edit videos like this, you dumb, stupid-looking bitch. 
[03:18:30]  So answer my fucking question.  How am I fake?  When all the videos and photos is of the same person, that is me.  And Cindy was in two of them.  Yeah, you little whore.  Now go back to hell with your mama.  She's waiting to fuck you some.  That's fucking great.  Isn't that the best?  And by the way, that is so real.  There is no fucking way anybody can fake that. 
[03:19:00]  You fucking moron.  Moron.  Yeah.  Moron.  She's in the background.  That is great.  Hiccuping the whole time.  Yeah.  Yeah, you moron.  Yeah, fucking whore.  You whore.  That's great.  I don't even know what it's about.  I don't either, but it's fantastical.  I guess going after a hater or something.  Yeah.  That's how you go after a hater right there.  Hells yes.  Fucking moron.  And everyone's dead in our family.  Yeah, it seems so.  Holy crap. 
[03:19:30]  Great shit, man.  And that's why we stayed late today.  Yeah, that was well worth it.  Well worth it.  I hope it's noted we stayed late today.  Yeah.  All right, y'all.  We're out of here.  I don't think.  Like it or not.  I don't think Chris.  Moron.  I don't think Chris knew the new truck protocol.  Why?  Where Kenny goes down now when the show ends because he can't sit there with the truck anymore  because he got a ticket once.  Right.  And he freaked out.  And I think Chris went and now he's waiting downstairs and the traffic guy gives tickets. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, there's a new traffic guy down there and he's a fucking asshole.  Prick.  He's a prick.  He's a prick.  All right.  Fucking moron.  Yeah.  You guys have a good weekend.  Yes, everyone.  I'm going to go work on a viral video.  Have fun.  Have fun.  Ian's going to work on his helicopters.  Yeah, I might actually do it.  I had to scrub the mission yesterday due to.  Well, no mission today.  Due to.  Wind.  I went.  No alcohol. 
[03:20:30]  No, I was drinking and I really shouldn't fly it around when I'm drinking beer.  Oh.  Not really.  Iraq, put that video up on the Facebook page because everyone's asking for it.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  It's up there.  Like us motherfuckers.  You can do the toast video.  I think I might have to do the toast video.  I think you should.  I got an angle on that.  The toast in the bag video that we filmed earlier.  That caught on fire right there.  Oh, yeah.  That was crazy.  I don't want that.  And my latest video with the no hands and the no feet. 
[03:21:00]  $2,750.  Not doing well.  No.  No.  Back to the drawing board.  Back to the drawing board for the opster.  At the opster.  Well, I didn't know how to hand her $2 because she had no hands.  Dude, you came off looking a little cheap in that one.  I purposely did, though.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  People are idiots.  I'm an idiot then.  Oh, are you really?  I had no...  I go, here you go, young lady.  Here's $2.  Of course.  Now you sound like me when I was trying to make up for not doing your bid.  It didn't come off as sarcastic enough. 
[03:21:30]  I thought it did.  It almost came off too much like, here's $2.  Like, you should be proud of this?  Not even like that.  Like, no thought was given to it at all.  It was just $2.  And we've been breaking down walls all day long.  Yes, I did the right thing.  A lot of walls.  I did the right thing when the camera was in wrong.  Oh.  Who gives a fuck?  No one wants to see you doing the right thing ever.  Would you flick a change ever?  Watch her catch it.  Well, it's funny you should say that because I saw her yesterday.  Yeah.  I want to dump, like, 20 quarters in her bucket.  Oh.  Because how would she pick them up? 
[03:22:00]  Roll them up in those fucking quarter rolls?  It'll take weeks.  Or the other thing is, give her a lot of money, but then, like, drop a 20 in front of her  and see how she handles that.  The other thing about her, I was telling my people that that's old school shit that we  remember growing up.  Yeah.  There was a scam going on in New York City where the homies, sorry, but it was the homies.  Yeah.  They would actually buy people like the one that's in my latest video, and they would  spread them around New York for the whole day. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Horrendously handicapped people.  And people would feel so bad.  They would just give so much money.  And then a van.  The news and the newspaper did stories on these people.  Then the van would come back at the end of the day and pick all these people up, and  they were living in horrible conditions up in the Bronx.  Because this woman that's in my latest video, I don't know how she got there.  Because she has no arms, no, well, half her arms are gone, and she has no feet.  So how does she roll?  And she's in an old school wheelchair.  It's impossible for her to wheel herself into that position. 
[03:23:00]  So someone is dropping her off like that.  And I hope they're treating her right, because I certainly am.  But they're not.  See, now people are going to have to see the video.  There you go.  See what I just did?  I got a few more views today.  Opie Radio on the YouTube.  I put up another Hulk Hogan video.  No, you didn't.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I did.  No, you didn't.  Yeah, I did.  Now you're lying.  Oh, you guys.  Ah, YouTube slash not Sam.  All right.  Look, we're leaving.  I'm out of here.  Do you want Radio Wizard or an E-Rock one?  Radio Wizard.  Radio Wizard.  Okay. 
[03:23:30]  The jingle contest going strong today.  Here's the standout from today, in case you missed it.  That's a good one.  Guys, seriously, have a good weekend.  Yeah.  See you Monday.  Ever since he was a young boy, he's been fucking bald.  His venison stinks, he just clutters up the hall.  Asking him questions like talking to a wall.  That egg-headed dummy doesn't like the show at all. 
[03:24:00]  He's the Radio Wizard, but doesn't know shit.  The Radio Wizard is such a stupid twit.  Why do you think he doesn't like the show?  I wish that he would. 
[03:24:30]  Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, indeed.  After Opie and Anthony Live, on a Friday,  I think Vivica A. Fox is going to be in here in a little bit.  It's very exciting.  But before she comes in, 
[03:25:00]  there's certain facts that you have to get across.  Of course, 866-WOW-1-WOW, you know the phone number by now.  If you ask any woman what the best gift they ever got was,  without hesitation, without even thinking about it,  she'll say her engagement ring.  The one thing I did right, besides marry my wife,  is I got her a great engagement ring.  It's so important.  It's not just a ring.  It's not just a sign of affection.  It's everything to her.  Every time she washes her hands,  every time someone at the store hands her change, 
[03:25:30]  you get credit.  Every time she shows her friends, you get credit.  You get credit for that ring every day,  so it's got to be perfect.  And Steven Singer gets that.  At Steven Singer Jewelers,  they have the perfect system to make sure you get the perfect ring.  Steven Singer knows how important it is,  and it's painless.

Listen to what I'm telling you. 
[03:26:00]  This is a guy you can trust with the most important gift  you'll ever give.  Steven Singer Jewelers,  the other corner of 8th and Walnut,  on the phone at 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER,  or online, of course.  You know it.  Say it with me at IHateStevenSinger.com.  It's true.  Engagement rings are important.  I'm loving this jingle contest, though.  The jingle contest that we're having on the Opie and Anthony show  is the best thing we've done in a long time,  and that includes Jocktober. 
[03:26:30]  Steven Singer, you know, while we're talking about him,  he's the one who's giving away $2,000  for whoever we decide is the best jingle.  And it doesn't have to...  I mean, I guess now we're using the term jingle very loosely.  You could do some kind of theme song, a stinger,  any kind of, like, little audio production piece  that you send in.  If it's funny, we'll play it.  And if it's better than everybody else's, it'll win.  You know, we were kind of had jingles in mind,  but if you do something that surprises us,  and we play it, and it's good, you know what I mean, 
[03:27:00]  you could easily win.  So send everything in to OpieAnthony at Stephen...  OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com.  It can't be any longer than 90 seconds.  You know, you would think that it would be much, much shorter.  But, if you've got an idea that's longer than average,  as long as it's not longer than 90 seconds,  you could do it.  We have a couple, and Travis just told me this.  He came in here after the show.  There were a few people who sent in after-show related jingles. 
[03:27:30]  I have not heard these yet,  so we're going to listen to them together.  The first one is from Lucas Hutton,  who did an E-Rock theme today.  Actually, let's play.  This is...  It's not the Coke Floats in My Cup.  It's not my favorite jingle of all time.  Lucas did the E-Rock MASH jingle.  We heard it earlier on the show today,  and this was it.  Eric is a dummy. 
[03:28:00]  Stole some pictures from Opie.  He has a child's mentality.  Can't go an hour without E.T.  Some think E-Rock is brainless.  I say retarded at best.  Now go to break, you dirty-hooped fat fuck. 
[03:28:30]  Go to break so he can have his cute lunch.  What did you think of that one, E-Rock?  I thought lyrically it was well put together.  Production-wise, not bad.  Using the MASH theme, great.  What do you think?  It's okay.  You didn't like it as much?  It's not bad.  There's some entries that we had that, you know,  like, ooh, that's rough.  That one's not bad.  I don't see it as being... 
[03:29:00]  So are you able to take yourself completely out of it, like...  Yeah.  You're not...  You don't get offended by it anymore.  No.  There was a time you did.  No, because also he used the MASH song for...  Remember sometimes when I was talking to Jim,  he would just start humming MASH?  Oh, my God.  I didn't know you...  I thought you guys would have picked up on that earlier.  No, none of us did.  You should have brought it up on the main show.  You guys were in the middle of it, so I didn't...  But, yeah, that's what it was.  All right, well, that's a little bit of brilliance.  Yeah, there's another layer to it.  There's subtleties that we're not paying attention to.  He also did the Radio Wizard jingle. 
[03:29:30]  Before you get to that...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not going to play it, but yeah.  All right, a jingle that we played earlier.  Let me see if I have it here.  But it was debuted yesterday.  Yeah.  Where the prep the bull, get the lube.  Yeah, that was a good one.  The voice that he's using is Little Mikey.  Who's Little Mikey?  Remember years ago, we did that...  Some comic, Christian comic, did a voice of a kid...  Oh, my God.  ...who's an aborted fetus.  Do you have any of those?  I don't know if I have his audio.  Of course, we did, yeah. 
[03:30:00]  We did this thing where we found this guy who did a character called Little Mikey, and he  was an aborted fetus.  And he would perform at churches and religious groups.  But it wasn't comedy.  Like, it was like, it was pro-life stuff.  And it would be this little...  And he was doing that voice.  You're so right.  He was doing the voice that sounded just like the jingle.  And we heard it today.  It was the prep the bull one that we were talking to Anthony and trying to figure out whether  he was saying, cup the balls or prep the bull.  It was that voice.  But he's sitting there telling everybody about his journey through the fallopian tubes and 
[03:30:30]  about what it was like to be alive.  And then in the end, they kill him.  And why did mommy kill me?  Right.  Because the lady gets an abortion.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not finding the original...  I have the words of this, but I'm not finding the original audio.  That's fine.  But yeah, that is what that's based on.  Yeah.  You can just search it on YouTube, Little Mikey.  Well, now, this guy Lucas Hunton, who did that E-Rock MASH thing, and he did the Radio  Wizard jingle, has submitted this specifically for After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:31:00]  After the real show ends, the shit hits the fans.  The man with the sideshow hair, Sammy the Whammy Roberts, hosts the stinkiest hour of  radio ever, the O&A After Show.  The shit show.  Sammy the Whammy.  That one sounds a little like the Mondo Topless style.  A little Russ Myers thing.  Hang on, what did you say? 
[03:31:30]  They have a good writing a few minutes.  Okay, that's fine.  Yeah, cool.  Yeah, it did sound a little Russ Myers, but there was no references.  Like, none of those references, like...  It's just saying that your show is shit.  Yeah, what's Sammy Whammy mean?  See, with E-Rock, it was like all these, like, show things, but then with that, there was  not one reference to anything.  Yeah.  Lucas.  Don't just give me some charity.  If you're gonna do a jingle for the After Show, let's make it happen.  Lucas is a regular on Twitter and feedback.  Yeah, I think I've met him before.  I think he came up here once during a Sunday show. 
[03:32:00]  This one is a second jingle that was sent in.  But this one was sent in by a true Sam Roberts superfan.  Actually, the very first, the original Sam Roberts superfan.  Eric, do you know who the original Sam Roberts superfan is?  No.  You don't know who the first person to be a Sam Roberts superfan is?  Well, besides Struff?  Struff is the answer.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  This guy, Struff, has been...  I mean, and this is before Larry, this is before any of these people were these, you  know, singing songs about me all the time.  It was Struff.  He was there when I was doing, you know, shows at midnight with Than. 
[03:32:30]  So let's see what Struff brings to the table to After Opie and Anthony Live for this jingle  contest.  Hey, it's Sam Roberts on the radio.  He takes phone calls, so call him maybe.  Play What Did You Learn Today on the After Show.  Call 1-866-WOW1-WOW.  It's the better of the two. 
[03:33:00]  I mean, you know, it's not a masterpiece, Struff, but it is the better of the two.  Would you say that, Eric?  I'll go with that.  It's the better of the two.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, keep them coming.  You can write...  It's no poke floats, uh, Iraq Army, but...  All right, if you want it.  Where is it?  This is...  And by the way, I was having a conversation with Eric about this.  He always gets on me because I say things about him on the air that he thinks I make  up out of nowhere.  And he's like, that's not true.  All the things that are in this song are personality traits that I gave you on the air. 
[03:33:30]  That's why it's a good thing, Eric.  I'm building you up.  I'm giving you, I'm giving you, you know, something to live up to.  I'm giving you enough of these traits where this is what you end up with.  I gotta get hook it in here to listen to that. 
[03:34:00]  What happens if hip-hop just starts adapting that into videos?  Just every hip...  They got those, um, solo cups with Coke floats.  Yeah, somebody heard this and they didn't know who you were, but they thought it sounded  cool.  So they're like, yeah, Coke floats isn't shit, motherfucker.  I love Coke floats.  Every black dude named Eric starts going by E-Rock.  Yeah.  You call me motherfucking Easy E-Rock. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  I'm the motherfucking sex bagel.  What?  I got bikini girls on my screen too, motherfucker, because I'm a boss.  That's right.  You can leave me at a concert all day long.  OP, my motherfucker.  That man know what up.  Coke floats in my cup.  I'm in the E-Rock army.  Nigga. 
[03:35:00]  That could work.  You'll see shirts soon saying Coke floats in my cup.  You should make them, dude.  I should.  This is your opportunity.  I don't drink them.  That was something Sam made up.  Whatevs.  All right.  You say whatever you want.  Justin Stangl from David Letterman's texting in saying, don't forget, I'm a Sam Roberts  super fan too.  Justin, I'll believe you when you produce a jingle for me.  Okay.  Or if he comes on the show.  Well, if he comes on the show, he's got to sing a jingle live.  I need jingles.  Bruce, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Holy shit. 
[03:35:30]  I never get on the after show.  I'm so fucking excited.  Sam, I fucking work nights.  I only get to listen to the replay, but listen, I love what you're doing.  I love the extra hour of content, and it's great.  It's different.  It's fun.  And one more thing, if you'll let me.  Of course I will, Bruce.  I'm a little white and a little Southern, so I don't know if I can say this.  I'll try to drop the R.  E-Rock, I'm in the car.  Thank you, Bruce.  E-Rock, do you like that call?  I'm isolating that. 
[03:36:00]  You like that?  Yep.  It's my second favorite clip.  I think this is going to be big for you.  What's your first favorite clip?  I'll play it for you.  Coke floats in my cup.  E-Rock Army, nigga.  I'm in, Eric.  I've been in the E-Rock Army for day one.  You know that.  Yeah.  You know I've always been.  Whether I wanted you there or not.  Yeah.  Okay.  Before you knew there was an E-Rock Army, I was in charge of that shit, making sure the  battle was happening.  Derek in North Carolina, you're on After Opie Anthony Live.  Sam, what's going on, brother?  How are you, my man?  I'm not going to probably live up to that other Southern dude. 
[03:36:30]  They just called him a little more Northern.  But I got a question about the jingle contest.  Do you got a second?  Sure.  Say if, I know the prize money is there, but if I make a pretty solid fucking jingle,  can we alter the prize of maybe the winner, myself, because I think I'll win, and I'm  going to sit in for one of the Jocktobers next year, a day in the Jocktobers seat, and  watch y'all do it?  Listen, I can't promise you a trip into this studio.  You better have a good fucking jingle. 
[03:37:00]  I mean, here's your best bet.  It's a fucking great jingle.  Here's your best bet, Derek.  You go, and you make the jingle knowing the prize is $2,000, right?  But you make that jingle so good that they're like, we got to meet this guy.  And then you go, I'm not free until October.  And they're like, all right, we'll fly.  We got to talk to you in October then.  I'm thinking, like, I would in 2000, I'd donate it to the EROC Army, and that should give me  a fucking pass to the fucking Jocktobers next year. 
[03:37:30]  I'm actually the treasurer for the EROC Army.  So yeah, that would work perfectly.  You just donate it right to me, and I'll put every penny goes towards helping the EROC Army  prosper.  All right.  Yeah, Derek, I'm telling you, just put together a kick-ass jingle, and then they'll be like,  we got to meet this Derek.  And then you'll be like, wow, I'm flying to New York in Jocktober.  And they'll be like, all right, come up to the studio.  All right, man.  Well, yeah, keep on the dial for the next week.  I'm going to have a fucking, the best damn jingle you've ever heard in your entire life.  I can't wait.  And if you don't hear it on the air, you call up, and I'll get Travis in here, and you 
[03:38:00]  can complain right to Travis for not putting your jingle on the air.  Deal.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  I found another old entry for a previous jingle contest.  You did?  Yeah.  Do you remember Sam's Not Black?  Yeah.  I didn't know.  Was that for a contest, or was that just for fun?  I don't know.  I thought it was for a contest.  You want to play it?  This was huge.  This was probably, like, this song was so, like, loved by the listeners.  I think this was the first time that people really started knowing the name Sam from Opie 
[03:38:30]  and Anthony.  Because there's the K-Rock version, which we had to, and there's the XL version, which  we have.  All right.  Eric, are you just going through bits looking for N-Words?  No.  Are you getting very excited about this E-Rock Army thing?  No, I was just searching for jingles.  Because you're playing the drops.  You're loving the callers.  Are you just searching, looking for N-Words now?  Because I don't want to do that type of show.  E-Rock Army, nigga.  No.  But I did, who kids told me that that was fine if I did that?  I know, it's fine.  Okay.  You got the pass.  Because I don't want you just looking, all right, you can play the bit, but I don't  want you just looking for stuff with N-Words in it. 
[03:39:00]  Okay.  Because I don't, I don't support it when it's used racially.  I know.  We know.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Sam's not black.  His ancestor's Thomas Jefferson.  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thong. 
[03:39:30]  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure?  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a nigga.  Oh, Jesus.  White or a nigga.  Yeah, we're teasing, you know.  Because he's white with an afro.  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  He ain't black.  I mean, I thought the N-word pronounced there seemed very racially charged. 
[03:40:00]  But beyond that, that's a fucking jingle.  That's Dave from New Jersey.  Dave from New Jersey must know what he's doing.  Whatever he does for a living, I hope jingle making is involved.  Nicole from the Morning Mashup just stopped by.  That's terrible.  I can't believe I just walked into that.  I do not like that word.  I do not think it's okay to use that word ever.  All right, well, you tell me then.  I'm going to play this one more time.  No, no.  No, no, no.  This is a different jingle.  And you tell me if it's appropriate here.  Because you may change your mind.  You know who would love that song?  Who?  My husband.  He loves that word?  He loves it. 
[03:40:30]  Does he use it with the E-R?  Yeah, he does.  He does.  In front of me.  And then we get in a huge fight every time.  How often does your husband use the N-word with the E-R at the end?  At least a couple times a day.  He does?  Yeah, he's like eh a little bit.  He's racist?  A little.  He says he's not, but he is.  Your husband's like a businessman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just, he just likes rich white people.  And that, you know, like when we go to Maine in the summertime.  Like Eric.  As we drive in.  Yeah, just like him.  How often do you use it?  Never.  Never use it once in my life.  Just on the air?  Never use it on the air ever.  Or we drive into Maine and as soon as we drive in he goes, smell that, white people. 
[03:41:00]  And I hate it.  Like it makes me be like, did I really marry this man?  It's disgusting.  Why did you marry a racist?  I don't know.  I didn't realize he was this bad.  I thought it was like sort of bad.  But he's kind of bad.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  Well, tell me if you think the word's appropriate when it's used here.  Feet up on the floor like I run a show.  Hogi in my mouth.  Hogi in my mouth.  E-R, Army nigga.  E-R, Army nigga.  E-R, Army nigga.  E-R, Army nigga.  Fat boy in the seat, bikini girls on the street. 
[03:41:30]  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup.  What?  Seriously?  E-R, Army.  I guess it's okay because I'm assuming that that man is African American.  No, I saw him on Twitter.  He's white.  He sounds not white.  Right.  So maybe he's okay with that.  I don't think it's ever really okay.  I don't like it.  I'm one of those people who just is like, no, it should be banished from the dictionary.  Is it in the dictionary?  Yeah, I think so.  Okay.  Not with the A though.  Probably with the E-R.  Okay.  Vivica Fox is coming in here in a few minutes. 
[03:42:00]  I don't think you should play those for her.  I don't think I'm going to.  Okay, good.  You want to try out to be my co-host?  Are you looking for a co-host?  Well, I don't know.  I mean, we're doing Jocktober and all these radio shows have these fantastic women with  them.  Yeah.  So should we try it?  I would love that.  But I don't need you getting all, like, you know, mash-up-y in here.  No, I'm not going to get mash-up-y.  But, you know, somebody did write on Twitter last night, how come you hate all holes on  radio shows, but you let Nicole on the after show?  Well, the thing about the listeners... 
[03:42:30]  You're the same people that write that you're an alcoholic.  I'm not an alcoholic.  No.  I haven't had one...  Okay, last night I had one glass of wine.  What?  One.  One.  I haven't...  I have not drank at all this week.  I've been pretty good.  The thing about it is that during October, a lot of the fans of the show start not realizing  that there is a difference between a female voice on a show...  And a whole.  And a whole.  Like, you come in here, and within two minutes you're like, hey, my husband is a racist  and he uses the N-word.  And then the last time you were like, I get into threesomes all the time.  Right, right.  And so that's not a whole talk. 
[03:43:00]  Right.  Like, a whole would be like, oh, I don't know, Sam.  I don't know if you should use that word.  Right.  You were like...  Little bitch.  Right.  Right.  You were like, you know why I don't like that word?  My husband.  Yeah.  He uses it constantly.  Got it.  That's not the same thing at all.  But how do you feel about being included in Jocktober this year?  Because all the shows that we've been doing, because they attack Facebook pages and  stuff, and they all end up with pictures of you on their Facebook pages, and it says  stuff like...  She's an alcoholic.  Nicole from the Morning Mashup is an alcoholic, or Nicole Biggin sent us here and posted 
[03:43:30]  a picture of you.  Which is complete lies.  I am not an alcoholic, and I don't even know who you people are.  I didn't send you anywhere.  There's a lot of radio shows that don't like you.  Really?  Because of that.  They think that you are behind Jocktober.  They think that I what?  That you're behind Jocktober.  I am not behind...  Well, who says it?  Are you saying that I'm behind Jocktober?  The listeners.  I told you.  I am not behind Jocktober.  I would never...  I don't even know any of the shows that you've done yet this October.  Terry Clifford got hit pretty bad today.  I think it's really mean what you do with Jocktober.  I would never want to be a part of it, because I'd be, number one, afraid that you would 
[03:44:00]  use the mashup in Jocktober.  That would be fun.  Thankfully, we haven't been a target yet.  I don't think I'm allowed to.  I think I'm not allowed to use SiriusXM shows.  Few.  Because we would get...  We would get raped.  You would?  It would be bad.  We'd get demolished.  What are some of the things that we would make fun of the morning mashup for?  The 411.  Shut up.  We'd probably make fun of my misinformation on the 411.  You'd make fun of Stan not being able to speak, a radio guy who cannot speak.  Is there any, like, hacky stuff that you do that's like, every show does this, but  you have to do it?  Yeah, like, tell us something good Tuesdays.  Like, come and share good news. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  You guys all sing?  Tell us something good.  That would be...  Yeah, kind of hokey.  That would be rough.  We sing about Stanley T's sack?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it's time for me to go.  No, stick around.  No, it's...  I love it, I love it.  Vivica A. Fox.  What's going on, girl?  Welcome.  Oh, my God, she's so gorgeous.  I can't.  I love the feminine energy that's in here all of a sudden.  Oh, my God.  Exude.  I did this little cutout just for you.  Thank you.  I don't have as much, and I feel like I need to make more cleavage, because Vivica's got  some banging cleavage. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, no, you're doing okay over there.  Trying.  Thank you, baby.  But this is Vivica's time.  It's Vivica's cleavage time, anyway.  You know, I don't need you coming in here and taking her cleavage attention.  Good morning.  Good morning to you.  Thank you.  Are you excited about the show?  Yes.  It's on Lifetime.  Yes.  It's kids pranking their moms.  Yes, prank my mom.  Yeah.  Yes, I'm the host of the show.  How did you end up hosting?  It's a hidden camera show.  Yes.  Where kids are pulling pranks on their moms.  Absolutely.  How did you end up as the host?  Well, back in the day, I did a show called The Starlet with Adam Reed, and he remembered 
[03:45:30]  me from that show was where we judged actresses.  And they got the show done, and they said, gosh, we want to attach a celebrity to it.  And Adam was like, Vivica Fox.  Love her.  Great energy.  Yeah.  And here we are today, and we're on the air.  Tonight, they're going to be running a marathon of it, because it's had such a wonderful response.  People are loving it.  Yeah.  Blowing me up on Twitter.  I want to prank my mama.  And this is a Lifetime show.  Yes.  So, just say it's family-friendly.  No, it's not.  Okay, because it's on at 10 o'clock at night.  Don't be fooled by the Lifetime signal, baby. 
[03:46:00]  Tell me what goes on on the show.  No, we've got sex tape mom.  Is that right?  Happy ending mom.  Yes.  How does that work?  DUI mom.  Well, the sex tape is that the daughter convinces the mom that her ex-boyfriend has a sex tape.  Okay, that's good.  And they need to break into the house to retrieve the sex tape so that it doesn't end up on the  internet.  And then when they come out, guess what?  There's the cops there.  And then the cops want to see you laugh.  I like that.  And then the cops want to watch the sex tape.  And then the cop is like, yo, your daughter got skills. 
[03:46:30]  So, we take them all the way there.  We layer the prank.  And the daughter is in the sex tape with the boyfriend.  Yes.  They have to break into the boyfriend's house to get the sex tape and the cops are watching.  Yes.  Well, no, the cops are conveniently waiting for them when they come out.  Yes.  Like the mom, we layer the prank and the mom, she just doesn't get it.  We put mom's love to the test.  I never did anything that elaborate, but I did tell my mom, I called her live on the  radio and told her that I slept with Ryan.  Oh.  I was like, mom, I got drunk last night and we did it. 
[03:47:00]  What did she say?  She goes, oh, dear.  Okay, you got to pull him aside.  You got to tell him that he meant nothing.  Yeah.  See, moms.  Have there been any ugly reactions from moms?  Oh, yes.  Like, this is not funny.  This is not good for television.  No.  You've hurt me.  I mean, they're relieved, to be very honest with you.  Yeah.  The majority of them, because we come in with a dozen of roses and you're on a hidden camera  test.  Oh.  And their kids, the main reason why they want to do it, because moms are so controlling  and they just want to do something to just say, gotcha.  There's always that element that you forget.  Like, nice people would be like, in the end, we have to make sure everything's okay. 
[03:47:30]  Like, Opie and Anthony used to do a thing where they'd get guys to call their moms and  either say they're gay or in jail.  Oh, no.  But then, in the end, there's no roses.  He's just like, Mom, I'm kidding.  I'm not really gay.  And the mom would be like, why would you do this to me?  Not funny at all.  Just because that day they felt like pulling their mom's leg.  Right.  Yeah.  We never think, like, you guys are good.  That's why it's good to do it on television and have writers and do a whole thing where  we think, well, what happens after?  Right.  And make sure everything gets cleaned up. 
[03:48:00]  Well, they're so relieved, to be honest with you, because a lot of them think that their  child's going to jail.  Right.  Or they think that their child has done wrong.  And then give them some flowers and a kiss.  Did you ever scare your parents when you were growing up?  Oh, I've definitely given my mom a couple of phone calls that she didn't care for.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was adventurous.  I was young, too.  I was in my 20s.  In the 20s, you know, you do some wild and crazy things.  I know.  And this is when you, where'd you grow up?  I'm from Indiana, but I lived in California.  I left when I was 17 years old in search of a dream. 
[03:48:30]  Okay.  So you could just imagine me calling my mom, or my dad.  My dad was a little bit more cooler.  Your dad was cooler?  Yeah.  You could tell your dad a little bit more things.  You know what I mean?  Moms are so overprotective.  And, you know, and I don't know, to call mom and share matters.  Did they support you when you were like 17 going off and moving to Hollywood?  Oh, absolutely.  They did?  Yeah, absolutely.  They were like, go.  And I've always had parents that were like, go after your dreams.  Very supportive. 
[03:49:00]  Just please don't do anything that you will embarrass the family.  And when you do, you have to call them.  And they don't know about some of the things I did.  Yeah.  Still is the same.  Kept it private.  So what do you think of how public your life kind of becomes as you move into Hollywood?  And you probably had to figure that out as you were younger.  But now it's way more public than it used to be.  Everybody's a damn detective, aren't they?  Like the camera phones.  Because that's the thing.  People don't move.  People don't move.  Just tell. 
[03:49:30]  They're stalkers.  They're not detectives.  Just tell too much.  They're stalkers.  Because people don't move to L.A. to be actors and actresses anymore.  They just move to L.A.  They're like, I'll buy a camera.  Yes.  And I could just tape actors walking around and sell it.  Or get on a reality show and have bad behavior and get rewarded for that as well.  Right.  There used to be a time that things were different.  But it's okay.  It's just life and evolvement.  That's the way that I look at it.  Well, it seems like you're evolving.  I'm trying.  There was a time when, you know, if you were a movie star, you wouldn't even be on television.  Right.  And now not only you're doing the reality show thing, you're doing, you know, hosting a 
[03:50:00]  show or whatever.  And I also am still acting.  I do have a sitcom out now called Mr. Box Office.  Executive produced by Byron Allen, co-starring Bill Bellamy, Rick Fox, Tim Meadows, John Lovitz,  Gary Busey, Essence Atkins.  What a cast.  Yeah.  What a cast.  So I'm on every Saturday on the CW.  On the CW.  Yes.  Is that a morning thing or at night?  No, night.  Oh, okay.  And we're bought for 94 episodes.  That's what they do now.  Booyah!  Bam!  You know what I'm saying?  When you get the contract for 94 episodes.  Where you're like, thank God.  Is that what you do? 
[03:50:30]  Yes, I've got a good job.  So, but do you have to sit there and film 94 episodes?  We do two a week.  For 40, for 50 weeks?  Yeah.  Well, we'll do probably about 20 to 24, take a couple of weeks off and then.  Wow.  Yeah.  So I've got a job for pretty much the next year.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  And why do shows do that now?  Well, you have to compete with reality.  And reality shows are so cheap to produce, quick to turn over.  Right.  And so they had to learn to get into competition with those.  So how the way you could do that is instead of it taking five days, doing one shows a week, 
[03:51:00]  you take two or three days, do two shows a week.  Tyler Perry introduced a lot of people into that way of making this.  So the whole seasons and your pickup is done.  Like you're on for a couple of years.  Yeah.  Done.  Get it right out of the way.  Yeah.  Done.  And so what is it that they just, they, the first few episodes air and they're like,  people like this.  Yeah.  And we'll do a hundred more.  Yep.  Keep going.  Yeah.  It's a great pickup.  So, you know, and like you do it faster.  So that's the new thing.  And I'm just so glad because reality had really taken a lot of jobs away from actors. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, totally.  And so now everyone's working again.  And are you glad to see that reality is kind of not as in style as it used to be?  Thank God.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Y'all 15 minutes is over.  Bye-bye.  See you later.  Was Kill Bill the funnest thing that you ever did?  No.  It wasn't.  No.  Kill Bill was the most torturous job that I've ever done.  Was it really?  Six months of training.  Are you kidding me?  Well, the Uma, the Uma.  Stretching my leg.  Badass though. 
[03:52:00]  Yes.  The Uma Thurman fight scene is one of the great movie fight scenes.  Like it's ridiculous.  And the choreography behind that is obviously so intricate and there's props everywhere and  you're flying all over the place.  But it wasn't, it wasn't fun to do.  No, it was fun to film.  I mean, it took us four days to film that scene.  Wow.  But the six months of training and I remember the last day of filming counting, I had 30  bruises all over my legs.  I did 97% of that scene.  Everything you see.  Wow.  The only thing I didn't do was crash into the table and I wanted to try that.  But it was made out of sugar glass and that my stunt double got cut, got four stitches. 
[03:52:30]  I thought that sugar glass doesn't cut.  It's still sharp.  It's still sharp.  Yeah.  How could it not be?  It's sugar.  It's crystals.  Yeah.  I don't know what sugar, I mean, sugar doesn't cut things.  Oh.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It did.  So they were, they were glad that I didn't do that, but I was covered in bruises.  But when I saw the scene, it was such kick butt, so hot.  Ridiculous.  That I loved it.  I really did.  I was like, it was, yeah, totally.  Does Quentin Tarantino really dress up for some of the scenes he does?  I've heard that he kind of gets into, like he's a character in the scene, even though 
[03:53:00]  he's off camera.  He heavily gets into it.  I mean, when we were watching that every Friday, we had to watch Kung Fu movies.  You did?  No, you didn't.  Like it was required?  Yeah.  That's the homework.  Yeah, that was our homework.  Excellent.  Do you like Kung Fu movies?  Back in the day.  Yeah.  I did.  Yeah.  Bruce Lee was hot.  But that was when it was.  He was one of the first Asian guys.  He was like, yeah.  Chop Suey, come here.  You know what I mean?  Love him.  But that was when it was current.  And so looking back now, maybe it's like, all right, we've kind of evolved away from this.  Oh, we definitely have evolved because we have special effects. 
[03:53:30]  Right.  Do you know what I mean?  But some of the original Bruce Lee movies for back in the day are classics.  I mean, those fight scenes were just amazing.  And is that what you were watching?  Because Tarantino also has, he's kind of known for having this ridiculous movie collection of  movies you never knew existed.  Oh, he has a movie theater in his house.  The B, C, and D, Ray movies.  Yeah.  He has a movie theater in his home.  And when we first started training, he had Margarita Night.  And we all came over and had margaritas and watched Kung Fu movies and a couple of other 
[03:54:00]  70s movies in general.  You have to understand, Quentin Tarantino was raised by three different types of women.  It was a black woman.  He was in Inglewood, California.  And yeah, he told me this story.  A black woman, a Spanish lady, and a white lady.  Why a spectrum right there?  Yeah.  I don't understand.  Well, they all live together.  Were they?  Yeah.  And they all live together in Inglewood.  Okay.  And so he had like three moms.  Were they in a relationship?  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They were just like roommates.  Okay.  But they were all like, so all these cultures get infused with him.  Yes.  And then he's watching all these 70s, you know, drive-in movies and stuff. 
[03:54:30]  And so he's just a different type of guy.  But he is one of the most professional and demanding directors I've ever worked with.  That's what I was going to ask you.  Because you've worked with tons of directors.  You've worked with everybody.  Yes.  A little bit.  Is doing a scene with Tarantino, is he a perfectionist?  Yes.  So is this fight scene, has it already happened in his head?  Yes.  And so move for move?  Yes.  He's like, no, that kick needs to be six inches higher.  Yes.  That's the demanding part.  And, you know, the hits had to be accurate. 
[03:55:00]  You know, he wanted it to really look authentic and for everyone to go, wow, you guys look  like assassins.  Right.  Because, you know, sometimes you go to a movie and see people and you automatically see the  damn stunt double.  Yeah.  Of course.  That pisses me off.  Of course.  Like, don't be trying to look kick butt and it's your stunt double doing everything.  Right.  Do the training.  Put the work in.  Even when you're still doing the work, don't you always have to have a stunt double?  No.  No, no, no, no.  For like one random scene.  To be honest with you, I actually prefer to do all of my stunts.  I'm very physical. 
[03:55:30]  Okay.  And I just think it looks better.  So what was the funnest movie that you did then?  If it wasn't that?  The funnest movie ever set it off.  You loved it.  I loved it with Queen Lativa, Jada Pinkett Smith, directed by F. Gary Gray, Kimberly Elise.  It was just like the little movie that could.  And six weeks of the last of the shoot, we filmed at night.  And so sometimes we would have breaks and it was just a chance for me and the girls to kick it.  You know, I introduced Queen Latifah to sushi and sake and, you know.  And to this day, she's like, you know who got me liking sushi? 
[03:56:00]  Vivica Fox.  So I love my Latifah.  And we just got to bond.  And it was a little movie that could, that opened up huge.  Yeah.  And it's one of those movies, too, that especially in hip hop, it's like.  A classic.  And it hasn't died.  Like, it's still like.  Yeah.  You listen to rap songs now and they're referencing that movie.  Yes, I know.  Do you know how many rap songs my name has made?  I do.  Plenty.  Plenty.  Watch me set it off.  Like, Vivica.  That's awesome.  I think that's cool.  You should be proud of that.  Oh, no, I am.  Oh, it doesn't bother me at all.  I just wish they sent me a check.  Yeah.  Right. 
[03:56:30]  You know, give me some of them residuals.  But does hip hop, because your personal life has also been infused in the hip hop world.  Yeah.  Your relationship with 50 Cent was very public.  Yes.  For like many, many years.  Finally, they're attaching him to somebody else.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's pretty delicious.  Yeah.  Was he at the time delicious?  Yes.  He was at the time.  He was kind of like at the time.  He was like literally one of the love of my life.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I always, always will have love for him.  Always will.  I have no beef against him.  We've both moved on to new chapters.  Yeah.  But at the time, it was fabulous. 
[03:57:00]  You were setting it off.  At the time.  Many nights.  I love you.  But does it get exhausting being in that hip hop world?  Do you still ask about it?  No, I meant.  Like you just did?  I meant.  It's okay, boo.  I meant.  He's still here, dammit.  No.  I meant.  I meant.  Having to be.  See, I've got a good sense of humor about it, right?  That's good.  Yes.  It's healthy.  Yes, it is.  Being infused in that hip hop world.  The culture.  I think the weird part about it, it's a blessing, but it's also a curse at the same time, 
[03:57:30]  because people don't let it go to know that you've moved on.  Do you know what I mean?  I'm like, honey, he's dated other people, and so have I.  And hip hop loves gossip.  And hip hop loves gossip.  Hip hop loves gossip.  Yes, but bad gossip.  Yeah.  Gossip.  Stuff that's just not true.  Yeah.  Like, you go, did you really believe that?  Yeah.  Okay.  But it's still like, even at the last BET Awards show, they were talking about, you  know, fights breaking out and gun threats and all that.  No, that's not a good look.  I don't like that.  No.  Yeah, that's bad.  That really makes black people look real bad. 
[03:58:00]  Dang, y'all can't even get together?  Dang.  Hang out?  We ain't changed, right?  Don't y'all need to smoke a blunt and chill?  Trying to reward ourselves here.  Right, right.  Ain't most of y'all high?  Yeah.  I know.  You should be chilled out.  Feeling good.  Right.  Ain't y'all got some Hennessy up in here?  Yeah.  Everybody should be laughing.  The whole point of the BET Awards is, you know, black people weren't getting a fair  shake on white entertainment award shows.  And then this goes down.  I agree with you.  And it happens.  But, you know, I do love that BET did come out and release a statement saying, we do not condemn  this behavior. 
[03:58:30]  They did that, or condone this behavior.  Condone, yeah.  And I was glad that-  Do condemn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do condemn, right.  But they don't condone it.  But, you know, it always takes just two or three bad apples to ruin it.  Yeah, because that's true.  You've got an auditorium full of people.  Yeah.  They're just chilling.  And I'm going to tell you something.  Most of them probably did smoke blunts.  I get real mad when I have gotten dressed up, got my hair and makeup done, and got my  outfit going on, and then we don't even get to go to the party and have fun.  It's not.  It's not cool.  Dang.  Yeah.  Well, listen.  Yes.  We're going to get to have a lot of fun.  We have had a lot of fun.  And break my mom is going to be even funner. 
[03:59:00]  Every Tuesday night, 10 p.m. on Lifetime, and check out Mr. Box Office every Saturday  on The CW.  For the next hundred weeks.  Yes.  We're good to go.  We're straight.  Thank you so much for stopping by the show, Vivica A. Fox.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  You're welcome back anytime.  I'll come on back.  And Nicole.  Yeah.

They are like F me shoes.  Look at those.  Right?  You kind of want to do her now. 
[03:59:30]  I mean, I wanted to before.  Okay.  He wants to see the shoes.  He wants to see the shoes.  Right up the ass.  Yeah.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye, everybody.  Much love, y'all.  Thank you.  Bye.  The Lopi and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
