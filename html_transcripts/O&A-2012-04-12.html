<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with announcements of their upcoming show at the Cleveland Hard Rock Cafe in two weeks, featuring a pre-show by Sam Roberts.  The hosts immediately launched into a discussion of Jeff Goldblum, who was a scheduled guest, and his role in the play "Seminar," also mentioning Justin Long and Jerry O'Connell's involvement.  Axl Rose's refusal of his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction sparked a debate, fueled by speculation about his ongoing feud with Slash.  The tragic Charlie Manson parole denial and the ongoing George Zimmerman trial following his arrest for second-degree murder were discussed, focusing on the "stand your ground" law and the potential for racial bias in the trial. Al Sharpton's involvement and the media's coverage were also critiqued. The hosts then shifted to a segment on "Toddlers & Tiaras," expressing amusement – and disgust – at the show's content and the mothers' behavior, before recommending viewers switch from Time Warner Cable to Fios.

The show continued with a segment on "slacktivism," criticizing the Kony 2012 campaign and media coverage of the Trayvon Martin case, using strong, offensive language to express their disdain for what they perceived as media bias and inconsistencies in reporting.  This transitioned into banter about clothing sizes and body image, fueled by a staff member, Roland, bringing in shirts.  A new comedy bit, "Yenta Explorers" (about two elderly women exploring the Titanic), was introduced.  Anthony Cumia then promoted his fictional "Anthony Cumia Fund for Cleft Palate Children" using highly offensive language, followed by a promotion for the equally offensive, sexually suggestive "Butt Trek" segment.  "Getting Topical with E-Rock" followed, a listener segment where E-Rock identified historically significant events, including musical anniversaries and the Metallica vs. Napster lawsuit, sparking discussion about various artists including Linda Ronstadt, and incorporating personal anecdotes from the hosts.

The upcoming Cleveland show was revisited, initially focusing on the availability of alcohol beyond beer, a concern eventually resolved.  This segment included anecdotes about their fathers and concluded with a sexually suggestive and offensive Mujan commercial featuring Otto and George.  The hosts then expressed their strong dislike of a Boy Butter lubricant advertisement, despite it being a sponsor.  Ricky Gervais and Jeff Goldblum were mentioned as future guests.

The broadcast moved to a discussion of martinis and devolved into insults and obscenities between the hosts.  This segued into Anderson Cooper's on-air reaction to a segment about "Dingus Day" in Buffalo, New York,  and his subsequent apology, which the hosts dismissed as unnecessary.  A caller, Andrew from Buffalo, explained the public outrage surrounding Dingus Day, contextualizing it with a Sabres playoff loss and general drunkenness.  Anderson Cooper's attempt to clarify his laughter was played, met with further disbelief from the hosts. The conversation broadened to other cultural traditions like Sadie Hawkins Day, and then to a lawsuit against a New York City restaurant, Chin-Chan, involving allegedly phallic dumplings and sexual harassment.  A caller, Leo, shared an anecdote about yelling obscenities in Japanese.  The conversation continued, veering to JWoww's attractiveness, the difficulties of removing morbidly obese individuals from their homes (with graphic descriptions), and personal preferences regarding body odor and hygiene.  A significant portion focused on a 600-pound man needing rescue from his home, with the hosts expressing disgust at the enablers.  The show ended with an extended discussion about feet, a cat wearing a hat video, a promotional segment, and a brief mention of upcoming guests.

A segment featuring studio guests Troy Quinn and later Jeff Goldblum followed.  The discussion began with an unnamed woman the hosts disliked, transitioning to awkward hallway encounters and bathroom etiquette, leading to a hypothetical fight between Opie and Troy, complete with stipulations like face guards. Troy's hair became a recurring point of mockery. Troy then promoted his music, including "Underwater Bimbos from Outer Space," with the song and music video played. Opie ultimately approved of having Every Time I Die on the show. Ideas for an Opie and Anthony promotional photo, including an "Employee of the Month" concept, were discussed before Jeff Goldblum arrived.  Goldblum's interview dominated, covering his role in *Death Wish* (with repeated use of offensive language), his acting techniques compared to Marlon Brando's, his Broadway play *Seminar*, and various anecdotes.  A game of "actor/movie" ensued.  Goldblum promoted his show before leaving.  The "After Opie and Anthony Live" segment followed, with listener calls, further discussion of Opie and Troy's potential fight, and more vulgar jokes and bodily function discussions.

Finally, a segment focusing on Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe" ensued, featuring vulgar discussions of anal sex, defecation, and hygiene.  Troy's alleged ass-eating habits and obsession with the song after meeting Jepsen were repeatedly referenced.  The song was played multiple times, eliciting varied reactions.  Listener and staff text messages were read aloud, adding to the chaotic banter.  The hosts speculated on the song's lack of airplay on Hits 1, and upcoming guests were mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better, yeah, yeah.  What, you're 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fucker, have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, good morning.  Sit back and enjoy the show.  The show.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  Welcome aboard.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  We're officially going to Cleveland. 
[00:01:30]  It's official.  It's official.  Two weeks out.  We could finally tell the people we're going to Cleveland.  Great, right?  Isn't that wonderful?  Well, this is a get-her-done organization, isn't it?  I'm amazed because I think I said that we're not going to Cleveland.  I think I said they'll fuck it up somehow.  We did.  But you know what?  They figured it out.  Barely.  And in a couple of weeks, we will be in Cleveland, Ohio, with all of you people that are going  to join us. 
[00:02:00]  Two weeks from tomorrow, Friday, April 27th, 4 to 7 p.m. at the Hard Rock Cafe, before opening  Anthony Live with Sam Roberts from 3 to 4.  What?  So I guess Sam's doing a pre-show.  What?  Sam does the pre-show.  We walk in nice.  We do 4 to 7 at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Jimmy, what do you do when you have to go on after somebody that really sucks?  How do you do that?  Because we need to know.  You'd rather do that.  How do you get the crowd back?  I'll tell you why I'm hesitating. 
[00:02:30]  I wanted to say, how about a nice hand for it?  And five names shot in.  You don't want to say that?  I just didn't know who to use.  All my friends.  You'd rather that than someone that is a rock star.  Yeah.  You don't want to follow, like, Guns N' Roses or something.  Right.  That's true.  So this is perfect for us.  And note the time.  4 to 7 p.m.  We're doing afternoon drive.  Afternoon drive, motherfuckers.  The event is 21 or over.  Space is extremely limited, so get there early.  Space.  We're doing cherry darts and some other things. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, man.  Cherry darts?  This is our first time back in Cleveland in five years.  What?  Five years?  Cleveland used to be a hotbed of activity for us.  Last time we went was for the virus tour?  In 2006.  Holy shit.  Shit cakes.  Oh, man.  Maybe we should do another virus tour if they'll have us.  Oh, yeah.  Well, try to get that going.  Good luck.  Good luck, Ski.  Slow down.  Slow down.  People are like, why don't you guys do anything anymore?  Well, because it's pretty much impossible.  Yeah.  At this point. 
[00:03:30]  Hard Rock is located at 230 West Huron Road.  Details available on SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And I would assume the details are on our Facebook page, EROC.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  They will be, yes.  They will be.  All right.  Jeez.  Fair enough.  Louise, huh?  We got penis dumplings to get to today.  We got Anderson Cooper apologizing.  A waddle-de-doodle.  We got the George Zimmerman being arrested.  The Zim.  And Goldblum is here today. 
[00:04:00]  And Goldblum.  Jeff Goldblum.  I saw his playlist.  How was it?  It's very good.  Justin Long is tremendous, too.  Really?  Yeah.  Like large?  Yeah.  I couldn't believe he was 7 foot 11.  I'm like, who is the big giant tinkling on me?  He's tremendous.  He was great.  What's the play about?  He plays, Jeff Goldblum plays a writing instructor.  It's a writing, it's called Seminar.  It's about four writers who have this guy come in and kind of talk about their stories.  Like a guy who's a hired gun comes in and kind of, you know, tells you about your work. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  And it's fucking really good, man.  And it's very funny.  It's an hour and a half.  It's not too, some plays drag.  Yeah.  It's just 90 minutes.  It's great.  Right.  I went with Bob Kelly.  Really funny.  Very cool.  In the middle of it, did they start going, yeah, da, da, da, da, da.  Singing.  Yeah, they were singing.  Well, I'm a writing.  I'm a writer and I'm a writing.  The big song was, get it on the page.  I've got a thought.  I've got to get it on the page.  It's kind of catchy. 
[00:05:00]  And musical.  Period, semi-colors dashes.  Periods hyphens.  Do they have choreography with a bunch of typewriters going off at the same time?  To get dancing.  Right.  That would be great.  And there's two, Justin Long, Jerry O'Connell's in it.  And I don't know the names of both of the women, but they were both really, really good.  There's only five people.  I mean, it's not like a big, drawn out annoying cast.  That sounds like a fucking bore fest.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:05:30]  That's a joke.  A little joke.  It's a joke.  Yeah, very good.  And watching Goldblum act is just...  Is he still good at it, you think?  Fuck tremendous, dude.  He's tremendous.  I'm watching this guy, because I'm looking, enjoying the play,  but I'm also watching his hands.  Ah, those hands.  And the way the guy moves, and it's so fucking natural.  The way these guys all do it.  How do you do that?  I'm like, it's hard to stand there and just deliver dialogue.  You're just great.  I don't know how it's done.  I don't know what happens when you have to act. 
[00:06:00]  Dude.  It just, like, you just can't be natural.  It's the hardest fucking thing to do.  Something shoots through your body and just changes everything.  Yeah, you're all stiff and fucking...  Also, for the first time in your life, you have to think about how you're walking.  Think about how you're staying.  Exactly.  But you don't do that when you're just wandering around.  I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  Like, if there were cameras in here, and they said,  All right, now, act as if you're doing the show.  Well, just when cameras are on...  It would be fucking weird.  You feel yourself doing things differently, right? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Just fucking odd, man.  So we'll talk to Goldblum later on this morning.  And, of course...  Another A-lister for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  This is crazy.  I want to, obviously, talk to him about goddamn Rich Cunt.  I hate Rich Cunt.  That's all I was thinking of.  I know.  He was in Death Wish.  Wait.  Death Wish.  He was in Death Wish.  I should have brought a copy of that, but I didn't.  Death Wish.  What did you get to be signed today?  I have a photo with him.  Nice.  And just a playbill.  Nice.  Oh, that's a good one.  Nice.  Yeah, it's a playbill. 
[00:07:00]  This news broke only a few hours ago, but Axl Rose, it's quick.  I fucking love Axl Rose now.  He declines induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  He doesn't want to go in, huh?  No.  And that's being a rock star, if you think about it.  It really is.  Fuck your establishment.  I know I'm great.  I know my band's great.  Fuck you guys.  Did he give a reason?  He probably doesn't want to hang with the rest of the guys, is what his reason is.  Is there an official reason? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, there's like a 1,500-word reason.  Really?  One of those?  He wrote a very long letter.  Oh, so what are the highlights?  Someone should go through the letter and give me some highlights.  I read it last night.  It's basically everything that you've heard Axl say.  You know, like, I'm damned if I do, I'm damned if I don't.  We tried to figure something out, but we couldn't figure something out, whatever that means.  Right.  You know, I'd rather just not do it.  I know that people really want a reunion, but sometimes, you know, we don't get the happy ending that we want, which is completely true. 
[00:08:00]  Like, he's like, he basically said, look, sometimes people get divorced.  He's like, and sometimes the fans don't get the happy ending that they want.  And that's true.  You know, as much as I would love to see Guns N' Roses get back together, like, sometimes that shit just doesn't happen.  Oh, they're saying sweet child, oh, wine.  Yeah, and he said, you know, wine.  See, the meaning just doesn't get anything.  Why would you take Axl's side on this and go, right on, man. 
[00:08:30]  That's a rock star.  He said, God knows how long I'm going to have to suffer the fallout from this.  But it's just a really long.  I praise honesty.  He doesn't want to be part of it.  Yeah, and he said, I don't want to be inducted.  He said, no one is to speak on my behalf.  No one is to mention my name.  Do not induct me as part of this Guns N' Roses.  Right.  He doesn't even want to be inducted, even though he's not there.  He will be.  What is it called?  In absentee.  In absentee.  Absentia.  Absentia.  Thank you.  That's the word. 
[00:09:00]  Yo, absentia.  He goes, I don't want to be inducted in absentia.  Justice for absentia.  I love it.  What happened?  I fucking love it.  Here's why I'm up in the air.  Well, we talk about how ridiculous the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is.  Yes.  So, I like this.  But he's had such a weird history of making his fans wait.  He makes people wait for hours.  Right.  Like, there's a weird thing with him.  Like, if Slash did it, I would go, he doesn't seem to have that history.  I would love to know what's really going on.  Because Slash said, Axl hates my guts. 
[00:09:30]  So, like, I wonder if one of them fucked the other's chick.  Like, something has happened that's unforgivable.  Something personal, right?  Something personal that's unforgivable.  I would love to know what that is.  I bet you it's not that big of a deal.  You think he's just bad-mouthing and stuff?  I think it's not that big of a deal.  It's just Axl Rose is just a fucking psycho.  Axl, he's a psycho, control freak, paranoid.  Yeah.  I bet you it's such a dumb thing.  If it came out, you would go, it's over that?  That little thing, they couldn't figure that out?  It's mainly him and Slash. 
[00:10:00]  Because Duff's played with them again, Izzy's played with them again.  Right.  Slash, he's not talking, though.  We bring up Guns N' Roses stuff every time he's in here, and he just doesn't want to go there.  Slash gave an interview, like, two weeks ago.  He said, I couldn't be more sick of talking about this.  Yeah, he tells us.  He's like, oh, that again?  I'm like, all right.  He said, Axl hates me.  Sorry, we'll talk about your new album that is maybe going to sell a hundredth of the  copies of a Guns N' Roses album.  Sorry.  And we like Slash, but it's frustrating.  I would love to hear some stories from him about what's going on there.  I would love to know what it really is, because it is Slash and Axl. 
[00:10:30]  I bet you it's some dumb, stupid thing.  I bet you it's something pretty personal.  You think it's heavy?  Yeah, because there's a lot of money to be made.  And when guys pass up this kind of fucking money, man, I mean, you know, Axl was a little  nutty, but that's a lot of money for anybody, because Axl was still doing gigs.  So he also feels that it's insulting to his current band, that everybody wants to see,  you know, what he calls the appetite and the illusion lineup.  He feels that it's insulting to the current Guns N' Roses lineup, that, like, hey, nobody 
[00:11:00]  gives a shit about this lineup.  Well, I mean, you know, the market dictated that, though.  Chinese democracy.  Sure, but, you know, in his eyes, this group has been broken up for, what, 15 years now?  He thinks Guns N' Roses has just continued.  We look at Guns like they stopped.  Oh, they stopped.  But he looks at it like it continued.  For me, after Use Your Illusion 1 and 2, they stopped.  He looks at it as...  That's about it for me.  That's about it for everybody.  Well, what came out after that?  I'm trying to remember now.  After what?  Use Your Illusion? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nothing, right?  Well, there was...  Spaghetti incident?  Spaghetti incident, but that was...  There was a couple of things on there that I liked.  Spaghetti incident.  But Axl feels that I'm Guns N' Roses, and those guys left, and these guys are new.  Kind of like Nine Inch Nails, where Trent Reznor's Nine Inch Nails, and he gets different  people to go out with him on each tour.  And that's kind of how Axl feels.  Can you tell the difference, though?  Musically?  With Nine Inch Nails.  Oh, Nine Inch Nails?  Absolutely not.  So then that's all right.  But with Guns N' Roses, you can totally tell the difference.  Yeah, but...  Those guys were kind of important. 
[00:12:00]  Sure, absolutely.  Slash was kind of important.  Trent Reznor writes those songs, you know?  Yeah, no.  Like, he is Nine Inch Nails.  But Axl Rose, like, yeah, he wrote Chinese Democracy, but he didn't write all of Appetite  and all of Illusion.  I think Duff wrote a lot of that.  There was a lot of help there.  Duff wrote a lot of it.  Slash wrote a lot of it.  Slash was right in there.  What the fuck happened that he hates him so much?  I don't know.  I think it's a dumb, stupid thing.  I really do.  I betcha.  He said, so let sleeping dogs lie or lying dogs sleep or whatever.  Time to move on.  People get divorced.  Life doesn't owe you your own personal happy ending, especially at another's, or in this 
[00:12:30]  case, several others' expense.  I like it.  I do.  I mean, I would love to see the original Guns N' Roses lineup, but I kind of like  that's how he feels and that's it.  It's the hard facts of life.  That's it.  You know?  He just doesn't want to do it.  There are people that I fucking can't stand.  Imagine, you know.  Why are you looking this way?  Jesus.  Look somewhere else, man.  Let me say that shit.  Imagine having a fucking, you know, oh, you're doing a project with the, you know, me doing  a project with my ex-wife. 
[00:13:00]  Imagine that.  Are you?  No.  You are?  What are you guys doing?  I never would.  What is it?  Oh, my God.  A little Sonny and Cher thing, maybe?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Never.  Oh, God bless.  God bless, Jimmy.  To Jimmy's point, what if there was an offer on the table that the money was ridiculous,  but you had to do it with your ex-wife?  How ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  It made you stop for a second.  Yeah, it did.  How about tens of millions?  Well, what would I have to do? 
[00:13:30]  You're getting weak.  What would I have to do?  How long is this fucking project?  You're getting weak.  Have a kid with her.  Oh, God.  Never.  Not even for 10 million.  10 million, have a kid with her.  Nope.  Eat her ass?  No, I can't.  No.  Ew.  No.  Wouldn't do anything.  No, come to think of it, no.  You wouldn't eat the ass of your ex for 10 million dollars?  No, no.  What the hell is wrong with you?  No.  It doesn't have to be about love or nothing.  Fuck that shit.  10 million.  A lot of bands get back together just for the money.  True. 
[00:14:00]  You know?  True.  Yeah.  Axl is one of them.  That's sort of breaking since we were last on the air.  And we could go from Guns N' Roses to good old Charlie Manson.  Yeah.  Denied parole again for the 12th time.  Yeah, for the 12th time.  Denied parole.  Doesn't have another opportunity for 15 years.  Why?  He officially didn't kill anyone, right?  Right. 
[00:14:30]  So why is he in jail?  I don't know.  We let a lot of scumbags out that have actually murdered people.  And then have murdered again.  And then murdered again?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, it is ridiculous.  I honestly can't see Charlie Manson really doing anything.  I don't really understand the judicial system at times.  I understand that whole thing was horrific.  I get it.  But he technically never killed anyone.  He's bigger than his name and he's bigger than what he did. 
[00:15:00]  It's like he symbolizes something.  And that's what's been imprisoned all these years.  He symbolizes a thing that was back then.  That scared a lot of people.  Right.  How long has he been in prison?  40 years?  Fuck, man.  Yeah.  Since 69, right?  Since 69, right?  So over 40 years.  Think of all the things that have happened in this world since he's been, and he's spent  all that time in prison when, you know, technology is just leaps and bounds. 
[00:15:30]  Technology has gone forward.  He's officially going to die in prison now because he's not up for parole until 27, 2027  or something like that.  It's 15 years from now, yeah.  Which will make him 92, 93, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  So I guess someone from the Tate family.  Look, I'm happy that he's in.  Was representing.  I'm happy he's in jail still, but I don't understand why.  Larry Tate.  He wants to stay in jail.  If other people actually murder people out there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And eventually get out.  Some of them do.  A lot of them do.  Look at the crazy at his parole hearings. 
[00:16:00]  He kept himself.  Had he become a model prisoner and really talked a little, a good game at the parole hearings,  he probably would have gotten out.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because as crazy as those things were, by 1985 or 1990, he had done 35 fucking years in  jail.  But he got the swastika.  And in interviews, he was perpetuating this image.  I'm a crazy fuck.  I have no remorse.  I'm going to kill people when I get out.  Because he wants to stay in jail.  So take your little stamp and deny. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  That's why.  Plus he got the death penalty, which was commuted.  So that's another reason they might keep him, because he technically should have got the  death penalty.  You know, they wanted to move him to a mental hospital, his people.  A mental hospital.  Is that much better?  You are a mental case.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I think it is pretty odd to just keep somebody caged up like that for his entire life.  It's just weird. 
[00:17:00]  I don't disagree with it.  No.  It's just such an odd thing.  Like, you just knew he was never going to get out.  When it's like, well, Charles Manson, for years we've heard that.  Charles Manson up for parole.  You're like, hey, no fucking way this motherfucker's getting out.  Now he looks like fucking Gandalf with his hair and beard.  Sure does.  All right.  Crazy man.  So they arrested George Zimmerman.  Yes.  Old Georgie Zim.  Second degree murder.  I mean. 
[00:17:30]  Good luck with that one.  Yeah, that's going to be hard to prove, right?  It certainly is.  Between...  What's second degree murder for the people out there?  Well, it's murder with malice.  Not necessarily forethought.  You don't have to have premeditation, but it's...  There's intent there, right?  Yeah.  Obviously.  There's intent, definitely.  But it's not premeditated.  Okay.  It could happen spur of the moment.  It's a harder charge than manslaughter. 
[00:18:00]  I just find it odd with the stand-your-ground law.  You know, it could be debated back and forth, but it is, in fact, a law that is in place  in Florida.  With the lack of actual witnesses to the shooting and what happened prior to it, with the physical  evidence of what happened prior to the shooting, Zimmerman being banged up and whatnot, this  all is going to make it very, very difficult for the prosecution there in Florida to get 
[00:18:30]  him on second degree murder.  It's astounding.  I think they're positioning for a plea.  I think they're positioning to try to give him a manslaughter plea so they go up with  the charge, the second degree.  Right, right.  Now they can come down and go, look, you either go on trial for a second degree murder or you  could cop the manslaughter plea.  We'll give you four years.  You'll be out in two.  But I think if he was smart, he wouldn't take the plea.  And he'd go to trial because I honestly cannot see him getting second degree murder. 
[00:19:00]  Hard to say, though, because it's a jury of your peers.  That's scary.  Yeah, you don't know.  How are they going to find a jury?  You don't know.  You give me one coffee drinker on that jury.  Jacket Child.  Yes.  Yes.  I know that one.  It does come down to the jury, but look at the jury on the Casey Anthony trial.  Now you're looking at Florida, obviously a different city, but everybody was absolutely 
[00:19:30]  certain she was going away.  And they looked at the evidence and there were people on there that were fucking horrified  that a kid was killed or died accidentally.  Whatever happened, the disposal of it, her lying.  But sometimes you do get a jury that just looks at the facts.  And the fact was the prosecution did not prove anything.  I don't mind them.  It's hard for them not to at least put him on trial because, again, it's one of those cases. 
[00:20:00]  And you shouldn't allow national whatever to influence you.  But it is one of those cases.  I think they did, too.  But I also think his 911 call hurt him in the fact that he did follow the guy.  And I know legally it doesn't matter that he did.  But I do think that that hurt him because he seems like he was the pursuer.  But if you look at it and listen to it, he's not told to not follow.  He was told something like, I wouldn't do that because he said, I'm following. 
[00:20:30]  And she goes, oh, that's not necessary.  The dispatcher said, yeah, that's not necessary.  And he said, OK.  So he's not.  And then what I'm hearing is that he then turned around and stopped following and was going back to his truck.  And that's when he was hit by Trayvon.  That's the story.  So this pursuing him thing after the 911 operator said that's not necessary could not even come into play. 
[00:21:00]  That might not even be what happened.  And, again, there's only so many people that can testify to this, one of them being Zimmerman.  And it's it's best he goes to jail for a little while and calms everyone down.  I don't know that that would you know something.  If he goes to jail just to calm people down for a couple of our justice system is fucked.  Well, we already know that, though. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, we already know our justice system is fucked.  Are we in agreement there?  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Let's put him in a nice cell, make him comfortable for a couple of years so we don't have fucking.  They have to prove the prosecution.  It's not.  The prosecution has to prove that he fired that gun without feeling that his life was being threatened at the time.  The only statements that have been made are him saying that his life was being threatened at the time. 
[00:22:00]  The stand your ground law is completely behind him.  I think they're going to have a very hard time proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he fired that shot without feeling that his life was being threatened at the time.  I do agree with you.  So good luck with Second Degree.  So what kind of lawyer is he going to get?  He's got a new lawyer.  Yeah, what did he have a lawyer?  Why was he?  He lost.  They said they had lost contact with him, that he had not he had not answered phone calls from these lawyers.  He never signed anything with these lawyers, never met face to face with them, with the original lawyers. 
[00:22:30]  So where did these lawyers come from?  I don't know.  They got in touch with them, though, and it was a phone call type of representation that wasn't he never signed a retainer with them.  Sounds like the guy that wanted to represent us.  Yeah, right.  That guy.  That guy.  What the hell is his name?  I don't even remember him anymore.  Douchebag.  So glad that name left my brain.  No.  Well, yeah, so I don't know.  This one is going to be another one of these very racially divided trials, like the OJ thing. 
[00:23:00]  I think we're going to have some, when a verdict is read, eventually we're going to see a lot of people, a lot of clips of people watching the TV, watching the verdict, a lot of outrage.  Can I come to your house when the verdict?  Oh, you'd be better.  I better have a small army at my house.  Please.  I'm going to hand out the weaponry.  Please.  We're all going to wait.  I beg you, please.  You're just going to hear, like, as the verdict's being read. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, please.  Will this be a few years in the making?  I don't think so.  I don't think that long.  This will be quick?  Probably not quick, but it's probably going to be a little while.  No, I don't think we're going to have to wait a year.  Really?  Yeah.  I hope it's televised, like the Casey Anthony trial was.  That'll be fun.  I think in a way, it's in their interest to do it, so everyone can see what's happening.  Right.  But people are so stupid and do not understand the judicial system. 
[00:24:00]  That was apparent during the Casey Anthony trial.  When you're watching that, look, contrary to popular belief, I'm not a lawyer.  But I can watch a trial and kind of get a line on what the jury would be thinking as, you know, as just a person.  Yeah.  And you've got to watch the whole thing.  And you have to listen to the boring parts to get an understanding of what you do with certain evidence.  Do you think they arrested him just to calm everyone down?  Absolutely.  So do I.  I mean, the prosecutor initially didn't file charges because they saw it as a fucking self-defense case. 
[00:24:30]  And what I'm confused by is the special prosecutor.  Yes.  What's that about?  Well, those are brought in when there's going to be a riot and you have to put somebody, arrest somebody.  Can anyone get a special prosecutor?  I don't know.  Like, I'm confused by that.  What do you want the prosecutor?  I don't understand how all that works. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, I don't either.  I don't know what the special prosecutor is when they bring that in.  But who decides that?  Probably the attorney general of Florida.  Do you think that's also, if the pressure is they don't want to arrest him because they don't know if they can win.  So maybe a special prosecutor being brought in by the state is someone who, it's like, because the DA doesn't want to take a hit.  They don't want to lose a major case like that.  It's embarrassing.  And it looks bad.  So you bring in somebody where if they lose, they leave. 
[00:25:30]  It doesn't matter.  They don't have to stand there and be reelected.  So if they lose the Zimmerman case, it's not the DA.  And I think if you go, if you circumvent the grand jury, you have to get a special prosecutor to then look at the case.  Do you think they circumvented the grand jury because they couldn't get a first degree?  Well, if it was a first degree charge, they would have to go before a grand jury.  Yeah, I think they left the grand jury process out to keep this more open to people.  The grand jury is closed. 
[00:26:00]  It's not a public forum, the grand jury.  So I think they're trying to get some transparency here to kind of placate some people, if you know what I mean.  Well, Reverend Al was happy.  He was on TV yesterday.  Reverend Al was with the family as they watched the news.  I love how he carefully picks his cases.  He certainly does.  Very carefully.  And then to get Holder, the fucking attorney general there, praising Al Sharpton and talking about this fucking case. 
[00:26:30]  That, to me, is a complete fucking travesty.  Does Sharpton have naked pictures of everyone?  Literally everyone.  I don't understand why anyone would praise this guy.  No credibility whatsoever.  I don't get it.  I'm sorry.  That Tawana Brawley thing is still there.  I don't care what the fuck you want to do.  No one would go before David Duke and praise him, no matter how good he's been since he was a fucking leader of the Ku Klux Klan.  But Reverend Al is able to put all that shit under the carpet and talk with the attorney general of the United States and get praise from him after he was involved in one of the biggest racially divisive lies. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, it's amazing.  I don't get it.  I don't get it either.  And the black people that I am in contact with, they say, look, he doesn't represent us.  Yeah.  You hear that a lot.  Oh, fuck yeah.  So who are the dummies that fucking look up to this guy?  The media, they love him because he gives good soundbites.  MSNBC loves him.  They give good soundbites.  Good soundbites and he gets people riled up.  And he gets people riled up, which is something to film. 
[00:27:30]  Sure.  He gets, he makes, it would be almost like for me if Al Sharpton did nothing but bring in laughers to a club.  You'd love him.  I'd love him.  Like if all he did was bring people in and sit up front and clap and laugh and not talk during the show.  Next thing you know, he's your best friend, right?  He'd be my guy.  Yeah.  I got it.  And in New Hampshire, one of the points that people are missing is that it's the Justice Department that said a crime was committed when the police said there wasn't one.  Right.  Yeah, that's a little, well, I guess that happens from time to time though, right?  From time to time.  Not a lot though. 
[00:28:00]  Nah, I guess not.  And our criticism is about the media most of it.  And I sent out a tweet last night.  I just retweeted what some guy sent me.  But just to watch, it's fun to watch the media cover certain things.  And there was a case of a drive-thru where the black guy murdered the white guy.  He said it was self-defense.  And the guy had a club, but it turns out it was a dog leash.  And again, I don't know, maybe it really was self-defense.  The interesting part is just the way the press handles it.  Or doesn't handle it at all.  Or doesn't handle it.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  And I don't know, maybe enough people are fucking screaming about this.  But it seems like in the press there has now been a concerted effort to not be, by some of them, Whoopi was talking about not being able to say nigger.  And she got beeped when she was saying it.  Yeah.  By the network.  And she was saying that you should be able to quote when you're quoting directly.  Of course.  And a few other ones are starting to talk about it now.  Either they're getting sick and tired of the directive.  Or people on Twitter are just getting to them.  Because these people, you could never get to the press before.  Right.  But they read Twitter like all of us do. 
[00:29:00]  They Google themselves like all of us do.  Yeah.  So they might be getting to them because a lot of them have been trying to come out like, no, no, we're not these pussies just telling the company line.  This is a very racially divided case.  I mean, it's really along racial lines, this thing.  I think you're very hard pressed to find black people that are for Zimmerman or that believe he's innocent.  Right. 
[00:29:30]  And it's purely based on race.  I don't know.  I think we're more racially divided now than we have been in quite a few years.  I think.  I was talking to a doctor recently.  Not Dr. Steve, honestly.  It was a guy that I know through another way.  Dr. Gay?  Travis?  And we were just chatting about something totally unrelated to this.  And I had a hoodie on.  And I forget how Trayvon Martin came up, but he goes, that kid just was in a place that he wasn't supposed to be in. 
[00:30:00]  And I didn't necessarily agree with that because I think he had a right to be there.  He was supposed to be there.  He was there seeing his dad.  Yeah, exactly.  But it was just interesting to me how different people see this.  Like, wow, that's somebody's actual take on it.  Right.  And I just didn't agree with it.  But that was somebody's honest, unfiltered take on it was that this kid just wasn't where he was supposed to be.  Not fuck him, he's dead.  It wasn't that type of a tone.  Right.  It was more like, hey, it's what happens.  Well, you could say wrong place, wrong time. 
[00:30:30]  That's different than saying he was someplace he wasn't supposed to be.  But even that, he was just, he literally, in that case, he had every right to be there.  Well, that's what's scary because he's kind of uninformed.  He didn't do his own research on the case.  Which most people are going to do.  Right.  So they just assume way too much without actually looking into the details of the situation.  Right.  You know what people don't understand?  We all do that.  The biggest fucking misconception and the biggest thing I see with people being uninformed about this whole thing, 
[00:31:00]  there does not have to be an actual threat.  There doesn't have to be a weapon.  All Zimmerman needs, especially with the Stand Your Ground law, is a perceived threat.  He has to have perceived that his life was being threatened, regardless of if it was or not.  People are saying the Skittles and iced tea doesn't fucking matter.  The fact that he wasn't armed doesn't fucking matter. 
[00:31:30]  It's a perceived threat.  And again, very hard-pressed to prove different.  The yelling is going to be hard to get around.  I would love to know who was yelling.  I mean, I know that they don't know at this point.  There are some witnesses that have come forward.  We're going to hear from them, obviously.  Yeah, hopefully.  But, I mean, I've heard just as many people say it was Zimmerman that was yelling.  But what they ought to do, honestly, like they did in Dilly Plaza with acoustics,  take him where he says he was. 
[00:32:00]  I'm sure they're going to do all that.  And have him yell.  I'm sure they're going to do all that.  That would be a way to do it.  I don't know.  Would you call the cops if you're going to be purposely murdering someone?  That's just it, too.  That comes into play and really kind of bolsters his ass.  But you could also say he did that to cover his ass.  Well, that sounds like premeditation.  Like he would have then have to have thought, all right, I'm going to shoot this guy.  So I better call the cops so I have some.  And honestly, it doesn't seem like the kind of situation where this guy was just out trying 
[00:32:30]  to find someone to shoot.  I mean, honestly, I mean, really, I think this guy is an overzealous fucking neighborhood  watch guy.  I think he has these delusions of fucking, you know, Dirty Harry.  Right.  But I honestly don't think those fantasies in his head were part of what he actually  wanted to do.  I don't think this guy wanted to go out and shoot some black kid that night. 
[00:33:00]  And I think calling the cops makes that pretty obvious.  I don't think he was covering his ass.  I think he that was his that was his job as a neighborhood watch guy.  I mean, apparently in the past, he's called the cops a lot because there have been instances  where there had been people walking around the neighborhood and and people's places had  been robbed and he was doing his job.  He called the police.  The police were on his way on their way.  Right.  He says he was then attacked by this kid and and shot him. 
[00:33:30]  That's what he that's his his story.  And we'll see what the witnesses say and what the police say, what the evidence shows.  And murder, too.  Good luck.  But now it's going to be a while before anything new pops in this case, you think?  Well, today, I think there's a he goes before the judge.  They try to get a bond for him.  Right.  The charges will be read and, you know, they get the ball rolling on this whole thing.  The jury selection is going to be another fucking amazing thing.  The that could take forever. 
[00:34:00]  They might even go for a change of venue because they think with all the publicity, they might  just try to get the case thrown out because with all the publicity, it'd be very hard  for him to get a fair trial.  Did you get the case thrown out for that?  I didn't know that.  Yeah, but I don't know.  That's going to be really rare.  It never really happens, but it's always presented that this case is so national.  I mean, you can't change the venue to another state and actually have it where people don't  know this case.  Florida, he might have a better shot, though, than other places because stand your ground 
[00:34:30]  is their law.  It's their law.  And they're also, you don't want to come to New York.  I mean, you're better off being where he is.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I don't even think they could change the state unless it was a federal civil rights  charge or something.  And I think he'll be up on a civil rights charge also.  He's definitely going to be up on a wrongful death suit after this.  This man is going to spend years, years in court with this whole thing. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  I honestly don't think he planned on doing that.  You know?  Who knows?  I mean, I'm not convinced either way.  I tend to decide only because it does look like he had bruising on his head.  Now, at first, I was like, fuck him.  But then it's like, all right, it does look like he had a cut on his head.  And just, I don't trust the way the media handles these things at all.  And I don't trust the angles they take at all.  I just want to hear what happens in court.  Because I just don't trust them.  It's going to be very interesting.  It's going to be one of these, you know, trials of the century kind of a thing that they 
[00:35:30]  promote.  But like Casey Anthony, again, I think a lot of people are going to be very surprised,  especially if they're not keeping tabs on what's happening and listening to the trial.  That would make the riots worse.  Oh, boy.  Please pay attention, people.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Please listen to the evidence.  That's all we ask.  Because if you just see him go to trial, and then the next thing you know, months later,  you're hearing not guilty.  Oh, my God.  Please, at the very least, you know, take a peek. 
[00:36:00]  Patten down the hatches.  Pay a little attention, please, I beg you.  Oh, please.  Oh, please.  So, well.  All right.  You know, imagine watching The Verdict in Weindange.  Oh, nice.  Or fucking Roosevelt.  That would be a great radio contest.  That's a good bit.  That's a good one.  Watch The Verdict in Roosevelt or Weindange.  That would be a great one.  Uptown.  Uptown here in Manhattan.  Uptown.  Uptown.  Let's go uptown for The Verdict.  What do you think, Sam?  Would you do that?  Would you go up to Martin Luther King Boulevard or Malcolm X and watch The Verdict? 
[00:36:30]  MLK is not as bad at it.  And one of the fucking black bars up there?  I don't think so.  There's too much of a risk of the wrong verdict coming back.  The second you hear, we, the jury, find the defendant.  And you just hear, boom, Sam just gets a big fist right on the side of his face before  not comes out.  Not guilty. 
[00:37:00]  We'll see.  Yeah.  All right.  That's the big story today.  Yeah.  What else is going on?  Oh, man.  You watching playoff hockey or what?  Where are you at with the playoff hockey, Ann?  Come on.  Join me.  I was watching Toddlers and Tiaras.  That's nice.  Fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  We're watching girls take fucking face plants.  Nice.  Start crying.  Another girl came out and she just forgets what she's supposed to do and she just starts  crying.  The mother's yelling.  Why do you like that show so much? 
[00:37:30]  I don't know.  It's kind of creepy.  No.  It's too fucking funny.  But you watch on a regular basis.  The mother's are despicable.  And I love watching kids get all upset and cry over dumb shit or face plants.  It's tough to watch a kid get upset or disappointed.  So I don't know how these moms do it.  I really don't.  Oh, their own kids?  It's funny watching other people's kids get upset. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'm not.  It's fucking hilarious.  I agree with you.  But when it's yours, it's tough, man.  Yeah.  And I can't imagine that these moms, I don't know how they could do that to their own child.  Yeah.  Because it seems like that show is just filled with complete disappointment, right?  Oh, it is.  And the mothers are really horrible about it, too.  They're like, oh, I don't think you didn't do very well in the beauty.  You didn't do very well in the beauty competition.  And the kids are like, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know how they could do that.  A mother was literally, last night, you know, usually they get the pixie sticks and  Red Bull and things to get their energy level up. 
[00:38:30]  A mother was literally pouring sugar packets in the kid's mouth.  That's like drugs.  It's like you're giving your kids speed.  That's technically drugs.  Yeah.  Technically.  Just pouring sugar down the kid's mouth to get her energy level up.  It's beginner drugs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, they drink Red Bull, these kids?  They give the kids Red Bull.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  They call it like go-go juice.  Yeah.  It's in a little sippy cup.  Little sippy cups.  And they're giving them Red Bull so they have some energy on the stage. 
[00:39:00]  Wow.  That's crazy.  It's fucking repulsive.  That's just as good as playoff hockey, I guess.  Ah, yeah.  There was a creepy stepfather, too, that was like his stepdaughter's up on the stage and  she's doing her little spins.  And the stepfather's like, he's in the crowd and under his breath, he's like, oh, she's  so beautiful.  That was the creepiest fucking thing.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Do they show that show?  I mean, obviously people watch it, but just to point out what disgusting parents these 
[00:39:30]  people are.  No.  I don't think so.  No, it's the freak show.  I think it's the freak show factor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They want people to get upset and, you know.  They banned the freak show from what?  The circuses and all that.  People talk about Coney Island's freak show.  That's stupid.  Yeah.  It's not the old school freak show.  Oh.  And, you know, you can't change how we think as human beings.  We love looking at freaky things.  Yeah.  So they kind of just repackaged it, really.  Yep.  And put it on TV.  There's a million of these things. 
[00:40:00]  They're all just freak shows.  Yeah.  They want people to, they like that shock value, you know.  Right.  They like people.  Yeah.  That kid's walking around in a, in a, what the hell was that movie?  Pretty Woman.  Pretty Woman.  Yeah.  So she dressed her up like a prostitute.  Those are F me boots.  Yeah.  On a four or five year old.  Yeah.  Six year old, whatever.  I don't know.  How old is she, you think?  Five or six, maybe?  No idea.  But the mother's just like, oh, great.  So weird.  They were calling, they were calling the kid a prostatot. 
[00:40:30]  Prostatot.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  So that was, that was on last night.  No, I haven't been watching any playoff hockey.  Playoff hockey's good at it.  Yeah.  It's good.  I just can't get into fucking hockey.  Well, my stupid, my stupid.  Since the drive for five.  My time Warner Cable.  I wanted to watch the Flyers Penguins last night, and I did.  How'd that work out for you on a.  Well, the Flyers had a huge comeback.  They were down three zip and won four, three in overtime.  And I was getting beat up for the sports curse because I'm picking the Flyers in that series. 
[00:41:00]  So everyone's beating the shit out of me.  And then in the end, look, Flyers win.  So let's all relax.  Yeah.  In overtime.  But Time Warner has a channel called Versus, and that's what the game is on.  It's, it's, I feel like I'm watching a VHS tape.  Oh, really?  It's horrible.  And there's not an HD version of Versus.  What?  And HD hockey fucking rules.  You, anything in HD, I don't watch standard definition anything anymore.  Right.  What the fuck is Time Warner doing? 
[00:41:30]  It's, everyone looked fuzzy.  That's wonderful.  Like, it was like a third generation VHS tape.  It's, it's horrible.  I slingbox everything now to the Manhattan apartment because I don't deal with Time Warner anymore.  Really?  They've pissed me off to the point where I can't even fucking deal.  So now I just, I fucking slingbox my, uh, my Fios right into Manhattan.  I got a technical, uh, um, question for you.  Oh.  When you're watching TV in Manhattan, right?  Yeah.  Does your picture size, uh, change? 
[00:42:00]  Um.  Depending on how they're outputting the signal?  On Time Warner?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Standard def channel will be in 4.3.  But I mean, also it'll squash.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why does, they don't do that anywhere else?  Is it on commercials?  They don't do that on Long Island.  They don't do that in Philly.  Commercials that happen.  My TV jumps from picture to picture.  It'll either be full screen, it'll squash, then you'll lose the top and bottom of the picture,  depending on how each channel's output.  And my, uh, tech guy says that's a fucking Time Warner issue. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, man.  Because where, you go anywhere else, everything is full screen, right?  Yeah.  It's annoying as fuck.  It's a terrible service.  Next thing you know, I'm watching for a while last night on, um, Versus with this Flyers-Penguins  game.  It was a square.  They had it, it was a square.  Well, that's standard def.  Who watches square TVs these days?  That's standard definition, then.  That's standard def.  But then I, without, without it being stretched.  But then I switched to the Knicks game.  They, they had a really important game.  I won't bore you with that shit. 
[00:43:00]  That's probably high HD.  They beat the Bucs, and they had to beat the Bucs.  The playoff race is tight right now.  And, um, that was full screen.  Yeah.  So then I went back to the hockey, and then they decided, ah, we'll make it full screen,  uh, full screen this time.  Then I go back to the Knicks game, full screen, back to the hockey.  It's square again.  That's weird that it would change in the middle of the game.  I don't understand, and my guy can't figure it out.  He thinks it's the Time Warner people.  Hmm.  It's unbelievable.  You could stretch, you could stretch the SD. 
[00:43:30]  No, I know all that.  And it, like, you know, it gets, people look fat on the sides of the screen kind of a thing.  Depending on the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Some shows you don't notice it at all.  Hmm.  What a pain in the ass, though.  Well, Travis says there is an HD version of Versus, now NBC Sports.  Somewhere in the 400s.  Somewhere in the 400s.  Okay.  Yeah, but then you go to the guide and you can't find it,  because they don't fucking update their guide.  How about you just skip files?  I might have to.  How about you just make the call?  You would be so fucking happy. 
[00:44:00]  You'd just go like, why did I wait?  There's not even a question.  It scares me.  What?  Why is it?  You're getting a product that stinks.  Why settle for it?  It's terrible fucking Time Warner.  I'm being called a tard.  You can call me a tard all you want.  He goes, there's no such thing as Versus anymore.  That's how I know it as, okay?  They changed the name.  I think they did change the name recently.  Yeah, it's NBC Sports.  I've just known it as Versus for so long.  Yeah.  So, okay, yeah, you're right.  Technically, it's not Versus anymore. 
[00:44:30]  Why put yourself through it?  Because you have a lot of stuff you love watching.  It scares me, Jimmy.  It just scares me.  But why the change?  You get Red Zone for fucking football.  I don't know.  I don't know what that is.  Time Warner is such a shit company.  I'm so happy to not give them money.  They're horrendous.  They're a terrible company.  All kidding aside, it's time for Fios.  It really is.  It just is.  They lost you.  Like, you wanted to stay with them, and they lost you.  They're awful.  That's like Cablevision.  I tried.  Same thing.  I was like, fuck this.  Fuck Cablevision. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  I'm finally making the move to Fios.  Years ago, I did it.  I love Fios.  And I couldn't be happier with that fucking service, man.  Well, good news.  The old Versus does have an HD channel.  I just got to find which 400 it is.  I love hitting the guide on Time Warner and scrolling down and just having it freeze up every three or four little channels that you go past in the guide.  And then it stops.  You hit the thing five times, and then it skips five spaces.  It's terrible.  I reboot my CableBox once a week easy. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, once a week.  Easy.  Sometimes I got to do it three times a night.  Does your TV just decide not to turn on sometimes?  Not to turn on.  Until you reboot the CableBox?  Exactly.  What a shitty company, man.  Just freezes.  What a shitty fucking company.  The picture will just digitize and pixelate and then freeze.  Right.  And you're like, oh, that's good.  I was watching a movie.  Yeah, I didn't need to watch that.  Yeah.  Oh, it's just fucked.  And then you can't get anyone on the phone because everyone else is pissed off because their movie froze. 
[00:46:00]  And then you change your service, and they want to fucking, they call you up.  What can we do to get you back?  Could we, you know, we're a lot less expensive than Fios.  Well, first of all, I don't think you are.  Secondly, even if you were, you should be because you stink.  And I don't want to buy a substandard service.  They have not called me.  I've got a few flyers.  But they have not really given a shit that I've gone, and I think they just have so many people leaving.  Would a Charles Lindbergh show up and Amelia Earhart? 
[00:46:30]  Oh, no, please.  Were they a couple of something?  A couple of flyers?  No, the guy, Eric Linderoth.  Johnny in Queens, help me out here, sir.  Good morning, boys.  What's up?  Yeah, Opie, that versus channel, which is now NBC Sports, is channel 481 for HD.  You are my best friend today.  H.  Johnny in Queens, me and you are BFFs, brother. 
[00:47:00]  H.  Okie dokie.  Because I can't watch hockey when all the players are fuzzy.  I hear you.  Regular channels shouldn't be fuzzy anymore.  I know the HD is the way to go, obviously.  But even just basic fucking channels should not be fuzzy.  I don't watch basic channels anymore.  I don't even, the second I go to the guide, I just go to HD channels.  Because you have the option on Fios to just look at HD channels on the guide.  Wow.  So you don't have to go through all the bullshit.  And I just hit HD, it just lists all the HD channels, and you just use those. 
[00:47:30]  You know what?  I'm ripping my cable boxes out today, and I'm going to throw it in someone's face.  That's very good.  That's how I'm going to give them their cable boxes back.  Yeah.  I'm just going to fucking throw it in their face.  I don't care how much they charge me for that.  Yeah, it'll be fun.  Fios will take them out for you.  Fios.  Fios.  Are they even doing new installations?  Yeah, they are.  Oh, they are.  Yeah, they're still doing it.  Aren't they in bed with some of these cable companies now?  Because the cable companies are like, oh, fuck, we can't compete with this shit.  We've got to make some kind of backroom deals.  They have made some deals with channels and stuff. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, I think they made some deals with the Madison Square Garden people.  Right.  And what not.  But it's still such a superior product as far as your cable TV goes.  It's great.  What deals with MSG?  It's great.  I think they made some kind of deal with MSG to get MSG on Fios.  But they had to do something with Time Warner.  Yeah.  Who owns that and stuff.  Some shit went down.  It's a backroom deal, but it didn't do anything to their product. 
[00:48:30]  It's just fucking so much better.  So much better.  Remember Linsanity?  What happened to Linsanity?  Oh, boy.  Bad.  Well, he's out for the season.  Oh, right, right, right.  Oh, that's right.  He had to be operated on.  Oh, no.  Remember that, though?  I just wanted to bring that up.  Remember Linsanity?  That was a hell of a two weeks.  But I said it on this show that the fucking guy would get injured because of how he plays.  Yeah.  I don't know if the two are connected, but I said, that's what scares me.  The way he plays and drives toward the hoop aggressively, something's going to happen. 
[00:49:00]  Remember Coney 2012?  Coney 2012.  Remember Coney 2012?  How long was that?  That guy went crazy, and that's what fucked everything up.  Did it?  Or is it just the fact that with social media these days, it's the cause du jour that goes  away in a couple of weeks, maybe?  Well, on April 15th, it was a Saturday.  It might be this Saturday.  They were supposed to plaster.  Right.  You're supposed to wake up in the morning and just see Coney 2012 signs everywhere.  Did we see that?  No.  Well, that's this week.  I don't think we're going to be seeing it.  Coming. 
[00:49:30]  Oh.  Is it the 20th?  I want to say 15th.  I thought it was 420, because I was like, oh, isn't that Hitler's birthday?  No, it's a Saturday.  One of my favorite things on Twitter is when one of these causes pops, and all these people,  like Pray for Japan was a really good one.  Oh, right.  And I'm like, and people think they're doing something by saying, by tweeting Pray for  Japan?  Yeah.  That shit drives me nuts.  And then they get mad if you go after them.  For every retweet, a dollar will go to, no, it won't.  But that's at least something. 
[00:50:00]  But it won't.  If it's real.  It's always fake.  It's always fake.  It's always fake.  All right.  Fair enough.  Those people are dummies.  But they just like, you know, and I write these people like, this means nothing.  This is useless.  And they get so mad.  Because for a while, they're just tweeting Coney 2012 was the thing to do.  Yeah.  And I would have discussions with some of these people.  Like, what is that doing, really?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Well, we're creating awareness.  Yeah.  Awareness.  Are you?  People don't realize it just doesn't.  Or today and then what?  You're back to, you know, praising Bieber? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  With Twitter, people's attention spans are really short.  And no one really picks up on a cause and sticks with it.  Because there's just so many things flashing in your face.  Right.  So many hashtags just flashing at you every day.  So when you get a cause and everyone piles on it, it's hilarious.  Where's Occupy, you know, the hashtag OWS?  That might come back, though.  What happened there?  You know what?  In the spring, we'll see.  It won't come back with the verve that they had when it was the big cause. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, true.  It just won't.  True.  Coney.  It just won't.  Because you know what?  There's something else.  Justice for Trayvon.  Meh.  It's just there's always something else that's going to pop in there and be that shiny pinwheel  in people's fucking faces.  Dr. Gay?  Dr. Gay?  Paging.  Dr. Gay!  Woo!  There's a word for this that I learned a month ago.  Gay.  Interrupting. 
[00:51:30]  Gay.  Yeah, gay.  Guys.  Yes.  Yes, doctor.  It's called slacktivism.  Boys, B-L-I-S.  Slacktivism?  Yeah, it's people who think.  That's a good one.  Yeah, it really is.  It's people who think that they're making a difference by liking something on Facebook or  reposting something on Twitter and like, hey, I've done my job.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Where'd you come up with that word?  I didn't come up with this.  Where'd you see that?  That's great.  I love it.  I don't know.  I saw it somewhere on the internet.  It's so weak.  Chip, you didn't come up with that.  I did.  Yeah, I did.  People tweet me and go, well, what are you doing for the cause? 
[00:52:00]  I'm like, that's my point.  I'm not doing anything.  And you're not doing anything either.  You think you are by tweeting Kony 2012.  By spreading the message they think that's their job.  Exactly.  That's slacktivism.  Oh, I love that term.  How do you spell that?  Slacktivism.  It's slacktivism with slack in front of him.  It's slacktivism.  It's slacktivism.  Slacktivism.  It's when you wear a pair of slilog slacks.  Oh, jeez.  He is slacks.  Hey, back to Trayvon Martin really fast.  What is pissing me off about the media on this whole story is the fact that they keep calling 
[00:52:30]  him a kid and stuff.  Yeah.  He was 6'2", 180 pounds.  Was he really?  Yeah.  They're showing that picture of him like he was 12 years old.  He was a big kid.  They show the little 14-year-old picture or something like that.  Is that how old he is in a picture?  Yeah.  Anywhere between 12 and 14, they're showing pictures of him.  6'2", 180 pounds.  They're creating the story.  That's scary, man.  They are creating the story.  I don't care what color you are.  6'2", 180 is scary to look at.  They are trying.  And what?  Zimmerman was 5'7 or something?  A little fat fucking guy. 
[00:53:00]  A little roly-poly guy.  What was the height difference?  I thought for some reason I thought Zimmerman was bigger.  That was the original media.  I'm hearing 5'7-ish.  No.  No.  5'7-ish.  And it was that first.  I'm not saying that means that Trayvon Martin, by the way, deserved to be shot.  I'm just saying I didn't pick that up from the media that the kid was 6'2", 180.  My perception is that the kid was just a little scurrying, little 14-year-old.  Because that's what they've shown us a million times.  And the first image is the one that sticks with people. 
[00:53:30]  Of course.  That's the one you kind of remember when you first hear the story.  And the press has such power over people to really put an image in your head and kind  of start making you, kind of base an opinion on that quick image you see.  And it was Zimmerman in gel orange from a mugshot.  And it was a 14-year-old Trayvon.  It just, it's, they were very selective.  Of course they were.  And what they did. 
[00:54:00]  Not accurate.  They're fucking pigs.  They really, they get into journalism because they want to make a difference.  They want to report the news.  And there are brave people, man.  They go over, they go into war zones.  They do shit that I would never do.  Those are not the people I'm talking about.  It's this fringe of the media.  And by fringe, I mean not wartime correspondents.  They're just fucking pigs.  Yeah.  They want to create the story.  They think only of pushing the story forward, of forwarding the story, of creating what they 
[00:54:30]  think is going to keep the story interesting tomorrow, what they think is going to start  a riot out there so they can cover it.  They're fucking pigs.  Right.  There's not one.  How do they do that?  Like there's no integrity.  None.  That NBC edit should have humiliated the entire fucking profession because it really is symbolic  of what they all do, even if they don't all do it that extremely.  It really, that should have been a bigger story. 
[00:55:00]  Of course it.  Should have been a bigger story.  Colin pointed something out that was really smart.  Well.  You know, Naughton, thin fingers.  It wasn't a bigger story, by the way, because they all do it.  And they understand that, so they're like, oh, fuck, we do this shit too.  Yeah.  What he said to me, we were at the cellar one night, and he goes, the story then became,  hey, NBC is really looking for the guy who, NBC is investigating.  That became the story.  Not look at these scumbags.  Right.  It's, they're investigating.  Like, they're still trying to spin it.  Oh, God.  They're just fucking disgusting, despicable people, and they're completely biased. 
[00:55:30]  And I like the fact that it's harder for them to do it now because of social media.  Yeah.  More people are aware that they're doing it.  You're able to see the raw clip and get raw audio these days when you weren't able to  do it a few years ago, so you could see the contrast between what they're putting on television  and what the real instance was with your own eyes or ears now.  I retweeted some black guy wrote, black journalist, wrote a really good thing, an honest thing  about how he felt when he saw, I think, that Baltimore incident, which was that he felt differently 
[00:56:00]  about it, and he was really honest about it, but he was saying that, of course, those guys  should go to prison for doing that, but he was really honest saying, I didn't feel, I  think he was, I think he was saying he didn't feel the same way he did with, when it was  a black victim.  He was very, very truthful.  I forget how he phrased it, but I really respected him for writing it.  Right on.  All right, we should take a break because we got to talk about penis dumplings next.  Do we?  Oh, yeah, we do.  Oh, yeah.  We got to get back to the dick jokes. 
[00:56:30]  We desperately need to get back to the dick jokes.  Is that the bread and butter?  It sure is, sir.  It sure is.  Jeff Goldblum at 9.30 today.  And then tomorrow, Ricky Gervais.  Nice.  I'm fucking bummed on this.  That fucking Ricky Gervais has not forgotten about us.  It's pretty nice to know.  Well, we'll see tomorrow.  If he doesn't know who we are.  You think tomorrow might be the last appearance finally?  Wonderful to be here.  Oh, I gave up my Jeremy Lin shirt officially. 
[00:57:00]  You did?  Roland, I gave up my Jeremy Lin shirt yesterday.  Did Roland?  Hell no.  It's been too much more.  Oh, God.  I gave it to my brother-in-law, who's a big Knicks fan.  I heard they're recalling those shirts.  Oh, what do you got for us?  You've got to hand it in.  What is this?  Roland's coming in with some shirts.  What the fuck am I?  A medium Metallica shirt?  You don't hang out with Roland like I do.  I got a cool pair of jeans.  Who?  Dude, these are cool fucking jeans.  I didn't get anything, by the way.  What the fuck is this?  I'm not wearing that. 
[00:57:30]  Roland.  You got a medium?  I came out a medium, though.  I'm a larger extra.  Who's that from?  I don't know.  My buddy, Kevin.  Tell Kevin thank you.  Fuck your buddy, Kevin.  I'd love to.  Is this a medium?  I was going to say, do you want to roll these stones?  No, I hate the rolling stones.  Look at this fucking rolling stones.  What size?  They're all medium.  Stop with medium.  This is medium?  What?  I need large.  Medjim.  We all are.  What do you think?  We're twinks in here?  Sam, are you a medium?  Medium.  I like that stones one.  That's cool, too.  I love these fucking shirts, dude.  Nice t-shirt. 
[00:58:00]  Well, no, I don't hate the rolling stones.  God, he's obsessed with the rolling stones, I think.  I'm not very, you know.  Which one is that?  I'm not such a fan that I'll get a shirt.  Which one is the green one?  I like this one.  Oh, those are very nice.  Nice.  I like it.  Oh.  I don't know if they're going to fit me, though, man.  That body, of course, you should show that body off.  Shut up, Jimmy.  The tighter, the better.  Jimmy, please.  I like to see it.  Like, when you lean forward, I want to see a ripple.  I'm barely hanging in there.  Fuck.  Oh, you're hanging.  Do hundreds of push-ups just to try to keep it all tight up top. 
[00:58:30]  It works.  Damn.  That's barely tight, trust me.  I fill up at those words.  It's like a damn rate of burst.  Barely holding on, and there's a lot of rain coming.  My levy's about to break.  Holy fuck.  I might have to get some fucking shit sucked out of me soon.  Oh, jeez.  A little lipo?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Who wants to lipo me out there?  Where do you go to get lipo?  I don't know. 
[00:59:00]  Might have to get my tits sucked out.  You gotta, jeez.  I've thought of that, too, getting my fucking lipo, then.  Have you?  Yeah.  Yeah, because when you look.  I mean, it's okay if you're like this.  And this is good, right?  And I know you're not looking, and that's fine.  No, no, no.  But as soon as you lean over a little bit, oh, fuck, there's a lot of hurt.  Is that like?  Oh, God.  Sometimes I'm brushing my teeth, and I lean over, and I got a big mirror, and I'm like, ugh.  With your balls on the sink?  I don't do what Jimmy does and squeeze the fat and yell at myself, because I've seen Jimmy do that. 
[00:59:30]  But it's just horrific.  But if I'm like this, it's good.  Look.  Nice, right?  Nice.  Nice.  Yeah.  Is this the Anderson Cooper thing?  No, this is the Anderson Cooper.  That's Yenta.  Is the Anderson Cooper thing good?  Mm-hmm.  And what's the Yenta?  What?  It's a new bit.  Oh, let's play new bit.  New bit.  New bit as we go to break.  New bit.  New bit.  I'm going to try out my Rolling Stones shirts during the break.  I've got to keep my headphones on.  Huh?  Relax.  We watch.  We'll get a stall.  I'd be mortified. 
[01:00:00]  Why?  I would just be mortified.  All the rods around the room?  Rods.  My rod.  All right.  Listen to this, fuckers.  Welcome back to Yenta Explorers with Marge and Gertrude.  Let's join the ladies as they head down to the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean to explore the Titanic.  Boy, this elevator sure the heck is taking quite a long time.  Ah, I hope no one pushes all the buttons on the way back up. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, stopping at every depth.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, this is like going up into the plane, but going down into the ocean.  Where's the clouds and stuff?  Oh, you're funny.  Up where's the whales on the sonar and not?  Hey, stop here.  I'm going to get off and buy some girdles.  Uh, floor five.  Shoes, hats, and gloves.  Ah, ladies' foundations and other picture postcards.  I'd love to go cave diving under there.  That's craziness.  Sure would. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, cave diving.  What are you doing?  Oh, let's journey to it.  Why don't they go down there and just lift it up with a bunch of ropes?  Just pick it up.  Push it.  It's like it's underwater.  Water, everything's lighter in the water.  I'd like to stick you down there in a second.  Quick, get me a Benson and Hedges.  I see the core.  Where's my Chesterfields?  Quick, get me a Moor.  I see the big circle of fire.  I'm smoking.  I'd love to have a Titanic pickle sandwich.  Hold the relish, darling.  This is the last one of its kind.  I'm going to have a little bit of pickle with a side of pickle juice. 
[01:01:30]  Get a starline plate.  I'm starving.  Crikey.  The Yent has made it all the way down, but will they make it back up?  Find out next time on Yent Explorers with Marge and Gertrude.  This is the Opie Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Humanitarian Anthony Cumia is calling arms to help fight a problem affecting children across the country. 
[01:02:00]  These little monstrous children with half of their upper lip and bottom of their nose missing.  The Anthony Cumia Fund for Cleft Palate Children is doing all it can to help treat newborns with hair lip and cleft palate.  Little predator-faced monsters.  According to the Cleft Palate Foundation, one out of 700 births in the United States will result in cleft lip.  Anthony Cumia sees this as an astounding statistic. 
[01:02:30]  Send your money so they can sew that gaping hatchet wound shut on these kids' upper jaws.  Won't you give and help Anthony fight this debilitating deformity in children across the country?  It's the Cleft Palate Program for little kids.  Look at what we did.  We helped a little monster.  Be proud and say you gave to the Anthony Cumia Fund for Cleft Palate Children.  I'm Anthony Cumia and I endorse this Cleft Palate Program.

[01:03:00]  But the crew members soon find themselves in a compromising position.  Oh my.  Why is there nothing between their legs?  It's silly.  There should be something there.  Why would these people be walking around?  They must be alien race.  Mr. Chekhov is unclipped.  I noticed that at the urinal.  I sure would like to suck it.  Join our heroes as they unravel the mystery of this strange new life form.  They all seem to be lacking something that I enjoy.

[01:04:00]  Boom, boom, boom.  Now let me hear you say,  Weeho.  Heyo.  Boom, boom, boom.  Now let me hear you say,  Weeho.  Heyo.  Boom, boom, boom.  Now let me hear you say,  Weeho.  Heyo.  Boom, boom, boom.  Now let me hear you say,  Weeho.  Heyo.  Boom, boom, boom.  Now let me hear you say,  Weeho.  Heyo.  Heyo!  Heyo!  Heyo!  Heyo!  Heyo! 
[01:04:30]  Heyo!  Heyo!  So be it!  Friend no more!  3-Samsam The Operatory Show  2 pieces  2 prepare  Friend no more  2 prepare no more  So be it  Saddle the score  Touch me again  With the words that you will hear evermore  Boo! 
[01:05:00]  What?  Getting topical  What?  Hold up!  Wait a minute!  With the sex man  Sorry, E-Rock, but that's a boo.  We're getting topical with E-Rock, Mr. Sexy himself this morning.  Yeah, life goes on.  E-Rock!  Fucking E-Rock!  We're grading you now.  I will say this.  You had a very tough choice, sir, but I think you picked the wrong one.  Well, I went with Matter of Importance.  Oh, really? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Alright, Anthony and Jimmy.  Yeah.  He said Matter of Importance.  Matter of Importance.  We'll leave it to the listeners, too, because maybe he's right.  I don't know.  I say there's four things he really got topical with, and they're all musical, which makes this easy to figure out.  Alright.  Simon and Garfunkel released The Boxer 43 years ago.  No.  Whoa.  Look how quick he was there.  Let's put this on a list.  Let's put this on a list. 
[01:06:00]  Okay?  Was that the most important thing today?  Or was it Hull?  Good old Courtney Love released live through this 18 years ago.  Wow.  Wait, this is 18?  Yeah, this is 18 years ago.  Holy fuck.  Holy fuck.  This is an AAF song.  No shit.  This is 18 years ago?  Oh my god.  I'm gonna cry.  This is the shit that bothers me.  I would have sworn that this was maybe 10 years old. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  In my dumb little brain, I would have said, ah, this song's about 10 years old.  Without thinking or doing any math, just kind of how it felt.  No, it's 18 years old.  Right.  It's 18 years old.  Wow.  That's fucked up.  Is that the number one thing happening today, as far as the getting topical segment?  Or do we go with Metallica suing Napster for copyright infringement 12 years ago?  That was 12.  Okay.  And I think it's between that and the next one.  And I would have went with the next one myself.  Or the Rolling Stones releasing Exile on Main Street 40 years ago. 
[01:07:00]  That was a monster album for the Rolling Stones.  40?  40 years ago.  Holy fuckaroni.  Would you have gone with the Rolling Stones thing or the Metallica thing?  The Metallica thing is whatever.  I don't think that's correct.  But that did change the world as far as suing Napster and all that.  Well, Exile on Main Street is one of the greatest fucking rock albums of all time.  What's on that one?  What's some of the songs on Exile on Main Street?  I don't know any of the songs on that one.  Uh.  Uh.  What we got?  Let's take a look here. 
[01:07:30]  Well.  Uh.  You got, I mean, if you want to go with the hits, you got Happy.  Happy.  All Down the Line.  Shine a Light.  What?  This song, you know, Happy.  No.  This isn't a big Stones song.  No, man.  You're a child of the 80's.  How would you know this?  Exactly.  Oh, okay.  I do another.  Tumbling Dice is on this end.  Oh!  Alright, I know that one.  Oh!  I'm tumbling!  And what happened?  I fell down on my tumbling dice!  I fell like a wee!  I went too good! 
[01:08:00]  You guys!  Hey, roll the dice!  I'll lay down!  Roll me!  Oh!  Okay!  I miss stupid dice.  Dice.  I miss all the dice.  Dice.  I miss all the dice.  Dice.  I miss all the dice.  Dice.  I miss all the dice.  Dice.  I remember this one.  This song's 40 years old.  I've heard this song.  I don't know.  Who did this?  Who else did this?  Someone Dice?  Yeah.  What do you mean, who else?  Was there someone covered it?  I think someone covered this.  And did well with it? 
[01:08:30]  Wow!  I don't know.  Linda Ronstadt.  Thank you.  Linda Ronstadt did this before she got Linda Ronstadt fat.  Is she fat?  Oh, yeah.  She's terrible now.  Yeah, this is Linda Ronstadt's version?  Yeah.  This is Linda Ronstadt's version?  Yeah.  This is Linda Ronstadt's version.  Yeah.  This is Linda Ronstadt's version.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is Linda Ronstadt's version?  Very good, E-Rock.  Let's see.  She had a great voice, though.  Yeah.  She did.  People try to rape me?  Always think I'm crazy.  People try to rape me? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, right?  I'm fucking grateful.  She went out with Jerry Brown, the governor of California?  Yes.  That guy?  When he was like a younger man, when he had some hair on his head.  He's like, I don't know how.  And do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  No.  E-Rock people are saying Metallica wins, so.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  I'll take back my boo.  Metallica. 
[01:09:30]  I'm gonna take back my boo.  What?  E-Rock Radio for the win.  For the win.  For the win.  It's time!  For the win.  Also Letterman 65 today for the people that care.  Happy birthday, Dave.  That's big.  65 for Letterman.  Do you like the Linda Ronstadt?  Well, not so much this song.  Did you ever like her?  What song?  What was her big song again?  Yeah.  What was her big song?  I haven't thought of.  Linda Ronstadt. 
[01:10:00]  She had like a big hit.  This is a little too.  Meh, meh, meh.  Mambly Pambly.  Mambly Pambly.  Mambly Pambly.  Mambly Pambly.  Sometimes I just say things and realize that is ridiculous.  But it makes sense.  Mambly Pambly.  I thought you said Nambly Pambly.  Oh boy.  No Uncle Paul.  We might have to get Mambly Pambly in the Urban Dictionary.  Mambly Pambly.  What was her big hit?  I forgot.  My dad used to call me that.  Don't be Mambly Pambly.  Oh really?  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Mambly Pambly?  I was being Mambly Pambly.  What is Mambly Pambly in his eyes?  A fag.  Eyes.  Being a fag.  He was really worried about that fag thing.  Yeah.  But it really snuck out, didn't it?  Oh, talk about the spaghetti incident.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're being Mambly Pambly?  I was being Mambly Pambly.  Were you?  I probably was.  I was probably weeping about something.  Constantly.  Why?  Why?  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Are you all manned up with a gun and all that stuff because your dad kept calling you a homo? 
[01:11:00]  Mambly Pambly?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Why won't one asshole fucking give us a Linda Ronstadt song?  A Linda Ronstadt.  How about one?  Like a rock.  Or one that would consider being like kind of.  You're no good.  That's it.  Play you're no good.  That should be easy for you to find.  That's a big hit.  Yeah, yeah.  This is like.  I can handle this one.  One of these.  What other songs are the greatest hits on?  This shows her voice a little more. 
[01:11:30]  A little better.  I can't see it.  I mean.  Yeah.  Crank it up a little bit there.  Good boy.  E-Roxy to crank it up.  You know this one?  Yeah.  My deafening ears and for my shitty eyes.  Sam, you gotta make that fun.  Now I see how you really are.  You're no good.  You're no good.  You're no good.  You're no good.  Baby, you're no good.  I would sing this if I didn't like my food in the diner.  I would just point out and go, you're no good. 
[01:12:00]  You're no good.  You're no good.  You're no good.  And they would come take it away.  Yeah.  They wouldn't spit on your food.  That meant I wouldn't send it back.  She did Desperado.  She liked doing other people's songs, huh?  Yeah.  A lot of covers.  Oh.  You want to hear Desperado?  No.  I don't.  Why would I?  That'll be the day.  Yeah.  That's another cover.  Tracks of My Tears.  When Will I Be Loved.  I Be Loved.  That's another one.  Yeah.  Heat Wave.  I don't know.  Hey, someone is saying, Chris in Richmond is saying, Namby Pamby is in Wikipedia. 
[01:12:30]  But that's not what Ant says.  No.  Mambly.  Mambly Pambly.  Mambly Pambly.  Don't be Mambly Pambly.  A little different.  A little different.  Stop with your pissy eyes.  I got that one, too.  Oh, boy.  Stop with the pissy eyes.  Wow.  Oh, God.  Did you get hit?  No, I never got hit for that.  I got hit that one time where I stole the quarters to buy ice cream sandwiches because  I was starving.  That was it?  Yeah.  And then Dad slapped me in the face. 
[01:13:00]  I was sitting in the truck and he blindsided me like a black guy.  He just popped me in the side of the head.  We all stole change growing up, though, right?  That was easy.  Yeah, but I think they were like silver quarters or something.  Oh, really?  I just took them down to thrifty drug and discount and got some ice cream.  Aw.  And I was very...  I just took a whole box of ice cream sandwiches and I went out by the train tracks behind the  place and ate them and ate all the ice cream sandwiches, much like I did my Uncle Joe's 
[01:13:30]  before he threw the box at me and called me a bummer.  You bummers.  Why did you have to eat the whole box of ice cream?  I was starving.  I was so hungry and it was so delicious.  Oh, yeah.  We had to fucking make sure the horses had hay, but, you know, I had to deal with fucking...  Would your father be amazed at you now?  I've never asked you this.  I think so.  Because for the people that are kind of newer listeners, Ant's father didn't live long 
[01:14:00]  to see Ant become this big radio guy.  Big star.  Big star.  Good thing.  I'd have to buy him trucks and probably a house.  Jesus.  Right.  Would he be amazed if he was alive and went to the compound?  Yeah.  He'd be right in there with the partying, right?  Oh, yeah.  The partying, the fucking guns.  He loved going to the range.  Used to take my Uncle Joe, as a matter of fact, hunting when my Uncle Joe was very young.  Yeah.  Uncle Joe talks about that.  I just saw my Uncle Joe at Easter.  I like Uncle Joe.  Oh, Uncle Joe is just out of his mind. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's a guitar guy.  We were having talks about, you know, Trayvon and stuff around the old family table.  An open discussion?  Oh, man.  That's called a closed discussion.  Oh, it was.  Let me tell you.  I can't imagine.  I think we set a new record for the use of the N-word.  Oh, my God.  You know, because there's still the old guard there at the house, you know?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:15:00]  And over at my aunt and uncle's house.  And, wow.  You still discuss those things.  But, yeah, my dad would have been right in there.  I don't know.  I think he'd have been very proud that I have swallowed every bit of emotion.  And, you know.  He'd be happy that you're not a Mambly.  But I don't have my pissy eyes.  What do you have, Mambly?  Mambly Pambly.  Mambly Pambly.  I don't have my Mambly Pambly pissy eyes.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Who's got Mambly Pambly on Twitter now?  Yeah, somebody's got to be Mambly Pambly.  I'm sure they're working on it right this second. 
[01:15:30]  Who's Mambly Pambly around here?  Oh, boy.  I don't need to know.  Who's all weepy around this joint?  No, I'm not a weeper.  No.  Fuck that weeping shit.  Ah.  Yeah.  At least he didn't.  Same weeps.  At least he didn't like aunt listening to crap on the radio.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  When he listened to, well, speaking of Simon and Garfunkel, when that came on.  When I think back to all the crap I learned in high school and he didn't like that when  we were in the car.  No.  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  More importantly, Mambly Pambly.  I think it's time for us to retire.  You think?  Yeah, man.  People are freaking out because I guess we're advertising for boy butter?  Boy butter lubricant?  Come on.  What?  I don't know what they fucking play more.  I don't listen during.  Ah, you gotta be kidding.  What's boy butter?  We used to have Budweiser, Sam Adams, Heineken.  Well, some amount of beers we used to have.  And now we got boy butter.  Strohs.  I'd rather not have advertising.  I don't give a fuck if it blows up this advertiser's spot. 
[01:16:30]  What's boy butter?  I don't want boy butter fucking advertising on our show.  I do.  I don't mind.  I love boy butter.  Chris, what is this shit?  How about man margarine?  It's just a perfect example of how your marketing department either doesn't know the demographic  or is lazy.  Because instead of getting a beer company, it's boy butter personal lubricant.  Jesus Christ.  Is it just Jackoff lube?  The guy had kind of an effeminate voice and he said you can take it into the bedroom. 
[01:17:00]  It sounds like something.  I can't believe it's not boy butter.  How about that?  No.  Look, we, you know.  Hmm.  Believe it or not, I think it shocks a lot of people.  We support the gays and stuff, but the boy butter thing is like, come on, man.  Why not?  What are we doing?  And boy butter spread.  I think that it's the sales department is, let's just say, a little lacking.  Yeah.  How do you not have a beer company on this show?  It's fucking amazing.  But fucking boy butter. 
[01:17:30]  And then I'm hearing that we're also advertising for that shitty company with the financing thing  that we've made fun of.  Hey, don't tell that.  They're giving people money.  It's great.  Let me go to Jack.  Could you find the ad for us there, Sam, please?  Jack Mehoff?  Jack.  That's not his name.  Ah, Chip.  Jack.  The Russian guy.  Why is he in such a hurry?  What was the one Iraq?  Not Iraq.  Rocco liked.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Hey, would you blow me?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, it's Heywood.  Hey, would you blow me?  All right, Rocco.  And he had to shove it down your face.  Like, you know, that whole thing is just to kind of keep it there.  You just say it.  Yeah.  But he had to make sure everyone got it.  Hey, it's Mike cunt.  No, that's not how it's said.  Right.  He died, right?  Yeah.  You're kidding.  Oh, God bless him.  We lost touch with him a long fucking time ago.  Yeah.  What did he die?  A heart attack?  I don't know. 
[01:18:30]  No one's really talking.  I know.  I haven't heard anything.  It's sad.  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Western sky.  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.  100%.  116% interest.  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We know.  Heap money, heap expensive.  Hmm.  Jack.  Waterpelt in your account in hours.  Hmm.  Ugh.  Just put him X on this rawhide.  Hmm.  Ugh.  Why is Governor Christie calling for education reform in New Jersey when he can't even educate 
[01:19:00]  himself about a proper weight?  Oh, he's just a big man.  He's just a large man.  He's a fat fuck.  Oh.  Hey, glad to see you guys got the gate back in the show with your boy butter.  Boy butter.  Oh, who are you?  Are you the Jack guy?  Okay.  What's up Jack?  Baggot.  Oh.  Oh.  Who's this dad?  Oh.  Dad calling?  Yeah, what are you being all mambly-pambly or something?  My mother would say that.  You're gonna get me pissy-eyed. 
[01:19:30]  Chip, but don't be mambly-pambly.  Take that dress off.  I think your dad's getting my dad fucking laid in heaven.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I think so.  Hanging out.  I think my dad just needed that little push.  Jesus Christ.  And if they met up there, I think your dad's doing the right thing to get my dad laid.  I really do.  I really believe that.  My dad would always look and go, take a drag of a cigarette.  Son of a bitch.  Let's do that.  Just kind of shut one eye, take a big drag of his fucking Tarryton.  Son of a bitch.  You got video of your dad? 
[01:20:00]  Um, there's probably some.  Yeah, I don't have it.  I guess Cory has it.  How old was he?  That was his wife.  When he died.  Um, like 60, something like that.  I was young.  Yeah.  Heart attack?  Yeah, he fucking smoked like a maniac his whole life.  You want to do dead dad day?  It's terrible.  What?  We'll bring in video and audio of our dead dads.  I don't have it though.  I think it's in California.  Let's get it.  You know, there's wedding.  Let's do dead dad day.  There's wedding video of him.  And, uh, at his wedding, the best man, his best man was the guy from the airplane movie. 
[01:20:30]  You know, the lead guy?  Right.  Wait, your dad's best man was, uh...  Yeah, it was that guy.  It was fucking, uh, what the hell's his name?  No.  Yeah, Robert Hayes.  That is your dad's best man?  Yeah, that was his best man at his wedding.  How do you know?  Why didn't you ever tell us this?  He was part of the, uh...  Show me Robert Hayes.  The Tortuga, um, riding club.  It was, uh, you know, horseback riding and shit like that.  And, uh, he was part of it and they... 
[01:21:00]  They were friends?  Were friends, yeah.  You met Robert Hayes?  Became really good friends.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  He was a huge star for about two years.  Oh, I know.  And it was during that time, too.  It was like the 80s and everything.  What else was he in?  We know him from airplane, obviously.  Anything else we cared about?  Uh, uh, Starman, I think.  Starman?  I think it was in the, um...  I don't remember Starman.  The TV series.  That's a black Robert Hayes.  Starman.  Ant's father wouldn't be hanging out with a black Robert Hayes.  It's Robert Hayes.  So there's, like, wedding video of that, but I think Corey has that out in California. 
[01:21:30]  Do you still keep in touch with her?  Not really.  You know?  Not really.  Oh, my God.  Last time I went.  Sorry, there's so much going on.  I apologize, Santa.  This fucking guy just writes,  The Boy Butter website looks extremely queer.  I'm sorry.  Because you're in the middle of something.  Extremely queer.  But you got Robert Hayes.  So let's bring in some audio of our dads, man. 
[01:22:00]  I got to find some.  I got some.  Oh, Jesus.  That does look really bad.  This is what's advertising on our show.  Ah!  Boy Butter.  It's just nonsense, man.  Is it really being played on our show?  It's great.  Do we have the ad?  I'm fine with it.  Yeah, we have the ad.  Yeah, I don't care.  I love it.  I'd use it if it worked.  I care because it just shows a lack of...  Oh, boy.  Is that a tranny?  I hope so.  What is that?  Head of Lettuce here for Boy Butter.  Head of Lettuce.  I know Head of Lettuce. 
[01:22:30]  How does Gay Male Personal Lubricant on the market today?  Gay Male Personal Lubricant.  Yeah, Head of Lettuce is a comic.  Why is Boy Butter so special?  Besides its creamy texture and delicious smell,  it's leaps and bounds over those silicone-based lubes on the market.  Ooh, ooh, mommy.  It won't stain your sheets.  With just a sponge, some water, and a little lob.  Nothing in CSI could detect a sexual eye.  I hate this place.  I really do.  I've been cool lately, but I fucking hate this place.  Oh, God.  I've been doing radio since I was 18.  It's come down to Boy Butter commercials. 
[01:23:00]  That's good.  So fucking lame.  I like it on garlic bread.  Some Boy Butter.  Yeah.  Or some gabagool.  Or a hot dog.  You put on a hot dog.  Oh, you shove the hot dog in your ass.  Yeah, that Boy Butter helps it.  You pull the hot dog out, you put it back in,  nobody knows what you're doing.  Where's the Boy Butter?  Hey, you gotta find it.  Hey.  Hide the Boy Butter.  We're playing.  All right.  I wanna hear the commercial.  I wanna hear the rest of that.  Well, this is the commercial they're airing on our channel.  Oh.  Maybe it's a little different.  I don't know.  All right.  This is my latest creation, Boy Butter Fresca, my personal lubricant masterpiece that is 
[01:23:30]  long lasting, easily washable, and infused with menthol for a mild cooling and tingly  effect.  Boy Butter Fresca will rock your world, especially in the bedroom.  It took about six months of insanely fun testing to create this delightful formula, and we have  two versions of Boy Butter Fresca.  Oh.  A creamy, oil-based Boy Butter Fresca, and a latex-safe, water-based Boy Butter Fresca  H2O.  Boy Butter Fresca.  My dad would be going, son of a bitch. 
[01:24:00]  A few people are saying, wait a minute, that's a real commercial.  I thought that was a fake fucking comedy piece you guys did.  Nah, that's real.  That's real.  Oh, another one was, pfft, Jesus Christ.  Like Jesus Christ.  Don't bust my chops.  Bust my balls.  Bust my onions.  Bust my onions.  What did he say?  Don't bust my onions?  Yeah.  Bust my onions.  Bust my onions.  I bet you because he smelled.  I bet you that his bag probably reeked.  When he was in New York moving vending machines all day. 
[01:24:30]  Oh.  I guess I wouldn't mind the Boy Butter as if I knew we had real advertisers on the show.  Oh, that would be kind of the throw in.  And I mean real, like, what do they used to call them, like blue chips or whatever?  What's that?  Oh, Jesus.  There was a term for, oh, why did I just do that?  Yeah, he's looking for a girl to do that.  I know, exactly.  Hey, what am I, a smurf or something?  I'm really sad.  You know?  Yeah.  If it was mixed in with a cup of beer.  With that. 
[01:25:00]  General Motors.  Something.  Something.  This is how desperate they are.  Amtrak.  This is how desperate they are.  Yeah.  I'd rather play our shit.  Kennel ration.  What?  Kennel ration.  I don't know.  Eh, dog food.  I don't know.  Something, right?  That would be nice.  Yeah, something like that.  Maybe some soap company.  Soap Dove.  Maybe.  They used to do this.  Irish Spring.  Yeah, that would be nice.  Something like that, right?  I would like that.  Tires.  I don't know.  Let me play devil's advocate. 
[01:25:30]  I don't know.  I kind of like the fact that this is the company I would want to deal with more than Dove  Soap.  Well, that's true.  How are we going to offend the boy butter people?  You're right.  They're not pulling their sponsors.  They're not fucking.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  Well, these people are not going to get us fucking fired.  I don't like it.  I do because they're paying the bills and they're not going to say something.  They're not going to get mad if we do a fucking dick show.  I love boy butter.  I don't like it.  Oh.  I enjoy it.  They're, they're really, I mean, the show is in a place where we should have real advertisers. 
[01:26:00]  I mean, I don't mind that.  Sure.  I don't mind a boy butter wants to fucking, you know, advertise on our show, but we're  the other ones.  We're the other people.  Really?  That's true.  What are you doing with your job?  Look at that.  Fucking really.  You don't mind that.  Greased up man.  I don't care if he uses it to jerk off or fuck eight friends as long as they pay the bills  and they're not going to complain.  Hey, these guys did a joke about, but fucking man, you get a fucking.  Oh God. 
[01:26:30]  That's a good one.  You don't mind that really.  That's hilarious.  He's churning butter.  He's churning them.  It's a product.  He's got a butter churn under one muscular arm.  The other one is on the churn handle and he's, he's jacking it.  Hey, if they fucking fish money out of their purse and hand it over, I don't give a  fuck what the product is.  Out of their purse.  Good for them.  Oh fuck.  Whatever you got to use to get that dick in there.  Atta boy.  Atta boy, huh?  Yeah.  Ah, Christ.  Whatever.  Mmm.  Oh, look at that one. 
[01:27:00]  Cool down this summer with boy butter fresca.  Why not?  Yeah.  It's hot all summer.  You want to cool down with boy butter fresca.  It's a guy on a hammock with one hand behind his head, the other one resting on his thigh  and he's wearing a little fucking bikini bottom and he's all greased up and hairy.  Just a, just a, just a little respect would be nice.  Mmm.  Just a little.  Slice off some boy butter.  Boy butter.  I just know where we used to be, man.  We used to have amazing advertisers.  Oh, you know.  Amazing.  And, and it's, it's stooped this low. 
[01:27:30]  That's, that's just kind of.  Well.  A bit depressing.  It's satellite radio, you know, get these sponsors in there.  Why wouldn't a beer company want to sponsor with us?  Well.  I heard a lot of beer companies.  Look at the last beer company that sponsored us.  Yeah.  But a lot of beer companies I heard pulled all their advertising for most of the platform.  Yeah.  From radio in general.  I think a lot of that.  Radio in general is very, uh, hard to advertise on.  That's too bad.  They also abandoned the show immediately.  Just like Opie.  Just like Opie.  Oh, look a V.  That is a very similar body.  Really?  You could be, you could be the spokesman for boy butter.  Oh boy. 
[01:28:00]  I'm going to fucking have to.  Oh boy.  I'm going to have to get an ace bandage and fucking tighten up everything.  No, you don't.  You should do boy butter reads.  Huh?  You should do boy butter reads.  Oh really?  Yeah.  Why not?  Yeah.  You're built like that.  Work like it.  Oh, I hope they, I hope they want to do live reads at some point.  And I'll, I'll just work my way to the bathroom every time and leave it in front of Opie.  You'll have to do the live reads.  Boy butter.  Watch how I do that live read.  No problem.  Give it to me.  Yeah.  Boy butter.  No problem. 
[01:28:30]  Give it to me.  They're all, they're all laughing.  They're all laughing at us though.  You guys are pitch men for gay lube now.  Yeah.  We're very.  They're just laughing at us.  God damn.  Oh well.  Son of a bitch.  I can see my dad now.  What the hell are you advertising?  Son of a bitch.  God damn Anthony.  Tony in Brooklyn saying you should represent Mujan.  Mujan.  We used to represent Mujan.  Mujan. 
[01:29:00]  Otto.  Otto and George did one of the greatest live reads for Mujan.  And it was on regular radio in it.  Do you have that?  Remember that one?  This was on regular radio.  Talking about pulling cunt hairs out.  It's probably on fucking YouTube somewhere.  Yeah.  If you can find that.  If Sam knew like real quick.  Right.  Searching the boy butter posters.  Yeah.  Right.  We get it.  It's gay.  Boy butter.  Mmm.  Yes.  You don't like the boy butter? 
[01:29:30]  Making sound effects of boy butter in use.  I used to make that noise.  Oh I do have it.  Doesn't stain.  You have it?  It's four minutes though.  Doesn't stain the sheets.  Oh what else are we doing today?  Let's go to break with the famous fucking Mujan read from Otto and George.  Who's going to play it?  You or Sam?  I got it.  Alright.  Hit it.  Uh oh.  I hope we have a lot of delay for this commercial.  Anthony?  Yes.  Mujan.  Mujan.  You want to explain to George the puppet what Mujan is?  Mujan is a wonderful way for women to get rid of unwanted body hair. 
[01:30:00]  Bikini line, legs, even mustaches, facial hair that girls might have.  And it's so much better than shaving.  It leaves the body very smooth.  Mujan.  Is that like electrolysis?  No.  It's a strip that comes in a package of the Mujan 2000.  You press it on and peel it off and completely smooth.  Wonderful, smooth, sexy skin. 
[01:30:30]  The name is smooth.  It's basically yanking tubic hairs out by the root.  Mujan.  Should be called.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  You know, we just spoke at the people from Mujan.  Yeah.  We had a demonstration in our office.  It is quick, painful, and completely removes hair.  Do you have a hairy knish?  Try Mujan.  Here's you.  Ah!  I hope the bastard appreciates this. 
[01:31:00]  Yanking my t*** hairs out by the root so I look good in a sundress.  Ugh!  Ah!  It should be called.  Ah!  Ah!  Sorry.  Yankee?  Wait, wait.  That line has to be on the radio.  Oh, it's great.  Thank you.  It's easy.  Peel.  Press it off.  Press it on and pull it off.  Unwanted hair.  Gone.  Almost painless.  No.  Except for the part where you go. 
[01:31:30]  Ah!  No unpleasant odors or chemicals to irritate the skin.  Mujan.  Gentle.  Has botanicals.  Hypoallergenic.  Removes hair completely.  It's slow to grow back.  Lighter, thinner.  Skin is softer, sexier than before.  Mujan.  It's wonderful.  You always throw that aloe in there.  There's aloe in there.  What is that?  I'm bleeding.  Take you to a hospital.  There's aloe in there.  There'll be no blood from Mujan.  It's wonderful.  It's so gentle. 
[01:32:00]  We saw a demonstration.  The hair comes off.  You don't even feel it.  I know it's biting at this point.  It's the most desirable way to remove hair.  You know what else is good?  Closing a storm window on your testicle is also good.  You know, for the hot weather.  Alright.  Just drop a storm window on your tea bag.  There's aloe in that window.  You want some aloe for your testicle?  Mujan.  Mujan. 
[01:32:30]  The most comfortable way to remove hair at home.  Why pay those salon prices?  Mujan removes hair completely.  If you don't see Mujan, go to the store manager and say,  Hey, my girl's got a poodle in her lap.  I need Mujan.  And I got actual audio of a girl?  Yes.  After she, you know, waxed her hair.  Okay.  Let's hear it.  See? 
[01:33:00]  It's so smooth.  She's so sexy.  She doesn't even need a brain anymore.  It's amazing.  So to get hair off of that...  PUSSA!  No one even heard this spot, but it's hilarious.  I don't even give a crap.  Ten people on hold are enjoying this.  Yeah, they hear the unedited version.  Is that a sponsor?  Oh, yeah.  It's not anymore, Otto.  There's aloe in there. 
[01:33:30]  Thanks for asking ahead of time.  If you get hit by a truck that's carrying aloe, does it still hurt?  Wait...  Ponder that one for a while.  Mujan.  The best way to remove that unwanted body hair.  All right.  Ask for it at a cosmetics store near...  The Open Anthony Channel.  Tired of those all-inclusive vacation packages to overcrowded Caribbean beaches?  The hottest vacation spot is practically in your own backyard. 
[01:34:00]  Visit Devil's Creek in the heart of downtown Edison, New Jersey.  Here's the founder of the Devil's Creek Tourism Board, James Norton,  who's going to share with you some of his fond memories of this beautiful vacation destination.  I have a really weird, vague memory of my pants around my ankles,  on the steps in this apartment building,  when there was an older boy.  An older boy who used to make me suck his penis.  He's gotta be older.  I think he tried to fuck me in the butt once, but it didn't work.  First, you'll fly into picturesque Newark, New Jersey. 
[01:34:30]  Then you'll whisk away southbound on the scenic New Jersey Turnpike  to beautiful Edison Township,  where you'll be a hop, skip, and a jump away from Devil's Creek,  where your fantasies become a reality.  It was these twins.  I would get both of them at different times to sit on my face,  because they used to pee their pants.  So I liked that smell.  Yeah.  And that would make them sit on my face behind the bushes so I could smell.  I remember my one friend, I was sucking his penis,  and we got caught by another friend.  He's the same one that fucking crazy...  He's the same one that urinated in my mouth.  For memories that'll last a lifetime, even the suppressed ones, 
[01:35:00]  come visit us at Devil's Creek.  I don't think I got erection to that age.  I can remember my friend's penis getting erect,  and me wondering why that happened with his penis.  I didn't know what that was.  It was in your mouth.  Jesus Christ.  The Hoover Kid.  Devil's Creek.  If you don't leave crying, we're not trying hard enough.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts  and one question with a guest we couldn't get. 
[01:35:30]  Reality Show and porno tape vixen, Kim Kardashian.  Primetime Sam Roberts with Kim Kardashian.  Kim, how often do you have to get groceries?  Once a week.  Thank you so much for your time.  Oh, you are so welcome.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts  and one question with a guest we couldn't get  on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:36:00]  Hey, this is John Valby.  Hey, this is Larry the Cable Guy.  Hey, folks, this is Mark Maron.  Hey, this is comedian Nick DiPaolo.  What's up? This is Joe Rogan.  You are listening to the Opie and Anthony Show,  my favorite show in the history of the fucking universe.  We might have a situation.  It's just a casual conversation we're having about our Cleveland show.  We're going up there to support Jimmy.  Obviously, he's recording his special. 
[01:36:30]  And we're going to be doing our show Friday, April 27th.  That's two weeks from tomorrow from 4 to 7 p.m. at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Take note, 4 to 7 p.m.  We're doing an afternoon drive show two weeks from tomorrow.  And Sam Roberts is going to do like a pregame from 3 to 4.  Event is 21 or over.  Space extremely limited.  So get there early.  And we'll be doing a bunch of things.  And it's our first appearance in five years.  And the Hard Rock is located at 230 West Huron. 
[01:37:00]  I guess they say it that way road.  Yeah, like Lake Huron.  Huron.  And details available on SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy's coming back.  All right.  So we were just kind of discussing it.  And we found out that good news, there will be alcohol.  Because the last time we had a live broadcast, everyone sat there like dummies because they weren't allowed to drink.  Yeah, they had sody pop.  Because we got mom and dad watching out for our listeners.  They all had a cold pop. 
[01:37:30]  Right.  And then it was brought up that maybe they're only serving beer.  And that was SiriusXM's choice.  Now, yeah.  So that kind of got Jimmy a little worked up.  It's an afternoon show.  I don't want to misrepresent, but Jimmy's a little worked up.  It's not like we're doing mornings where, you know, people won't be drinking either.  It's an afternoon show.  It's really not up to, you know, SiriusXM to decide if our listeners can have a drink or not.  No.  Especially if the broadcast isn't a live bar. 
[01:38:00]  Jimmy?  Well.  Jimmy got a little worked up.  I don't want to misrepresent.  There's bad news and there's good news.  Oh, all right.  The bad news is I spoke to Gary.  Kidding, of course.  No, you're not.  No, he was fine.  The good news is he said they can serve whatever they serve.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So we're talking booze.  Booze.  Beer spooze.  All that shit, tough guy. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  But it was brought up that maybe they should only serve beer.  Yeah.  Oh, was that part of the meeting?  Yeah.  Was it part of the meeting?  Sam will tell me the truth.  Yeah, Sam.  Sam, tell me the truth.  I mean, it wasn't part of the meetings that I was in.  Travis has private meetings with management where they discuss things that we can't do.  Oh, is that it?  Uh-huh.  You have private meetings?  You have private meetings.  Travis gets private meetings.  Yeah.  They don't let me go to all the meetings because I talk too much.  Are we allowed to do lap dances? 
[01:39:00]  As opposed to Roland who just sleeps through the meetings.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  A couple weeks ago it came up that right now it was only beer and I told Jim-  What?  I told Jim after I said that, I said, look, that was three weeks ago.  It could be completely different.  And it is.  And it is.  And everybody's happy and we're going to have a great show at the Hard Rock.  Two weeks from tomorrow.  What if someone wants a Harvey Wallbanger?  Yeah.  What are we going to do?  What if somebody wants to have a Manhattan?  I want a Rusty Nail. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, I'd like to have another Cosmopolitan if you don't mind.  Yes.  Please whip one up for me if you could.  A gin and tonic.  They got potato skins too.  What?  There you go.  What's the potatoes?  They're all going to be cold.  Oh, no.  What's a Rusty Nail, by the way?  I think it's Drambuie.  Drambuie.  My grandma used to drink.  What's Drambuie?  Drambuie.  I don't know.  It's Scotch and Drambuie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Drambuie. 
[01:40:00]  Will that get you fucked up?  Drink it neat.  What's neat mean?  Yeah, it's with nothing in it.  No ice.  No nothing.  Do you like your martinis dirty?  I like a little olive juice and something there.  Dirt that shit up.  Martinis are fucking some vodka.  It's a little rough.  Not when they put some of those nice flavors in there.  Yeah?  You like the flavored martinis?  Oh, yeah.  I do like the flavored martinis too.  Oh, yeah.  I do.  T-martoonies.  That's what I would say instead of two martinis.  You have T-martoonies? 
[01:40:30]  That's wrong.  You sound drunk, stupid.  I'm mean Chip.  I'm an asshole.  Mean Chip is a dick.  Fuck you.  Don't say that shit to me.  You're a dickhead.  Piece of shit with a hat.  What's a goddamn Chip?  Fuckin' hate Sam.  Fuckin' scumbag cock-suckin' motherfucker.  Chip is blue.  Wow.  Piece of garbage with big eyebrows.  Hope your eyebrows fall into the ditch.  Stupid comment.  Doesn't even make sense.  It's a fuckin' idiot.  That's why.  Yeah.  We got someone apologizing.  Every day someone has to apologize in this world. 
[01:41:00]  We are in a culture of apologies.  Right.  Yes, we are.  It is the, uh, the decade of the apology is, uh, this new, the decad.  In this decad, we will go to the moon and do those other things.  Like when he says that, like, I don't know, the moon, it's a big one.  And do those other things.  Did he say that?  Yeah.  And do those other things?  Do those other things.  Um.  End of the decad.  My brains will be all over the trunk.  Yeah.  End of the decad. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Next week.  Yeah.  Beginning of the decad.  Ick benine air-conditioned skull.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, um, you like the Anderson Cooper?  Uh.  I don't mind the Anderson Cooper.  Just saying I don't mind.  I really don't think much of him.  I don't mind.  I don't think about him that much.  Yeah.  He does his little show.  He tries to have a little fun with his little show.  Like we try to have fun with our little show.  He does his little show. 
[01:42:00]  Does a segment called retarded people in the news.  Ridiculous.  Oh.  Does he spell D-I-D-I-C-K though?  Yeah, yeah.  He does.  He should.  He should, right?  Sam?  How much boy butter do you think is in his medicine cabinet?  I was going to say anus.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, we don't know.  Well, you don't, but we really don't know.  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  What do you think?  Anderson Cooper.  We just don't know Sam.  I think probably.  I think the jury's still out.  Could be. 
[01:42:30]  So Anderson Cooper did his little segment and had a little fun with it.  Yeah.  And I, once again, will say there's nothing wrong with this.  No.  There's nothing wrong with this.  He's entertaining people.  There was no reason for him to have to apologize.  Well, this is what went down.  I disagree.  And here's how you celebrate Dingus Day.  Dingus Day.  The spooky little rituals include boys sprinkling girls that they fancy with water.  And the girls striking back with a tap from a pussy willow branch.  Oh. 
[01:43:00]  Whoa.  Ah, Chip's laughing at that one.  So the guy sprinkles water.  Oh, okay.  Guy sprinkles water.  Yeah, it's a dumb little thing.  And then a girl gets a pussy willow branch.  Right.  Ah, pussy.  Ah, pussy.  And taps the boy.  Yes.  What does that mean?  It's time to do some of that fucking?  It means they like each other.  I think it leads to some of that fucking.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Some of that fucking.  What is the problem?  I don't know, you dingus.  Whoa.  What is the problem?  Whoa.  This seems ridiculous. 
[01:43:30]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Hence being part of his ridiculous segment.  Whoa.  Whoa.  It's ridiculous.  What do you think of that, Bobo?  What do you think, Bobo?  I'm Anderson Cooper.  I'm Anderson Cooper.  I'm Anderson Cooper.  I'm Anderson Cooper.  I'm Anderson Cooper.  Wow.  Ford is sponsoring podcasts all over the place, according to Matt Bishop, which I trust,  but not a regular, regular, can't say regular radio show.  Yeah.  The sales department needs a lot to be desired.  Oh, hell.  It stinks. 
[01:44:00]  Ah, here we go.  So, Anderson Cooper, you know, he started laughing because he thinks it's ridiculous.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Nice.  Oh, boy.  Boy, butter.  I'm not going to let you do this one.  Sorry.  Ahem.  That's so stupid.  Oh.  It's really so stupid.  Ahem.  Oh.  It's really so stupid.  Ahem.  Oh.  It's really so stupid.  Ahem.  Oh.  It's really so stupid. 
[01:44:30]  Ahem.  Oh.  It's really so stupid.  That's so stupid.  That's hilarious.  He has cracked up like this a few times.  That's fucking funny.  He has definitely lost it a few times on that show he does.  Yeah.  This is a real moment.  We want this on our TVs.  Right.  It's really so stupid.  So stupid.  Stop.  Come on.  Listen to that laugh. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, boy.  Come on.  You tell me that titter hasn't happened.  Oh, yes.  By the time the fourth finger goes in.  Ha ha.  A little boy butter in the throat.  Ha ha ha.  Just gotta let it out.  Just gotta let it out.  Unfortunately, we're the only ones that are going to tell you there's nothing fucking  wrong with this.  What's wrong with that? 
[01:45:30]  And why did he have to apologize?  Right.  To dinguses.  Dingus.  Buffalo got upset.  Well, Buffalo has a big Polish community.  I know that from my time up there.  Literally big, too.  They're all big.  Yeah.  Big fucking Polish women.  Yeah.  That's where we used to call them Buffalo Bettys.  And I think most of them were the Polish broods.  Polish women are kind of sexy, though, man.  If they keep their shit together, you drove to the airport, you drove right through the  Polish area. 
[01:46:00]  Like the one legged one on the Sopranos.  Remember her?  Is she Polish?  Wasn't Tony fucking her?  All right.  Pop her up.  See if you can find her.  She was Russian.  Was she?  I thought she was the Polish broad.  She got her leg taken by Janet's sister.  Oh, yeah, yeah, right?  Yeah.  Took the wooden leg.  While Sam finds that, let's learn a little more about this dingus day from Andrew in Buffalo.  Andrew, you've been waiting for this day to call in with some info for us.  So let's do this.  What's up, Paul? 
[01:46:30]  Hey, man.  Hey, just want to let you know, dingus day is basically the freaking Christmas day around  Buffalo.  I mean, it's like they had a parade downtown and it was, I don't know, it had to be at  least 8,000 people there just hitting people with the pussy willows and shit.  How fucking ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  And like Anderson Cooper said, it's stupid.  So why is everyone pissed off?  I don't know.  I don't know.  People were just crazy.  Well, people were also pissed at Sabres lost at the playoffs.  But I don't know. 
[01:47:00]  People were just getting drunk, basically.  Just an excuse to get wasted.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Anderson Cooper had fun with it.  And unfortunately, someone fucking complained.  And unfortunately, the CNN bosses basically told Anderson Cooper he better apologize.  That's how this comes about.  So now the next time you see Anderson Cooper, you know, he's going to be very careful before  he has a real moment.  And that's why this stuff sucks.  Don't fucking don't cater to these assholes.  I don't know why they fucking do that.  You heard Cooper laughing and giggling like a little schoolgirl, right? 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  And now listen to Anderson Cooper.  All right.  Now, if you notice in the midst of the giggle fit, I said something like this is so stupid.  It's so stupid.  I said it twice.  Now, some people, especially folks in the Buffalo area, seem to think I was calling Dingus  Day itself stupid.  I absolutely was not.  I was saying that my giggle fit was so stupid.  And it was.  I also.  Oh, no.  Then you get him lying.  It's just crap across the board.  Doesn't he say. 
[01:48:00]  You said it's so stupid because you thought the whole Dingus Day is stupid.  Right.  Come on, Anderson Cooper.  I don't blame him because this is the world we live in and you got to kind of protect your  shit.  Holy shit.  He's actually saying his laughing was so stupid.  No.  He was laughing because the fucking thing is so stupid.  It's obvious.  And I don't blame him.  These dumb bosses will get to you and fucking force you to do this shit.  I was saying that my giggle fit was so stupid and it was. 
[01:48:30]  I also said it was torture at one point.  I certainly wasn't calling Dingus Day torture.  I said it was stupid because it's stupid that a grown man giggles like a 13 year old  girl meeting Justin Bieber for the first time.  And I think it's stupid that I cannot stop giggling once I start.  No.  No.  You're lying.  Stop it.  Dingus Day sounds awful.  A bunch of adults tickling each other with pussy willows.  Right.  It's fucking idiotic.  And Anderson Cooper makes fun of it and there's a problem.  Come on.  What is going on?  It's all idiotic. 
[01:49:00]  All these religious holidays or religious rituals are fucking.  All of them are stupid.  Is this even a religious holiday this Dingus Day?  I don't know.  I think it's like some kind of a Polish thing.  What was it called when we were growing up where the roles switched and the girls asked  you out?  It was Sadie Hawkins Day.  Yeah.  Remember the Sadie Hawkins shit?  Sadie Hawkins Day where the girl would ask you out.  And guess who was hoping to be asked out all day long and it never happened.  I'm sure they don't do that anymore because the rejection factor would start bullying and  guys would be fucking beating up each other because, you know. 
[01:49:30]  Beat each other up.  Beat each other up.  Me, yo.  Right, Mike?  What do you say, Bill?  Not in a town, right?  Paint up the town.  And then the Cooper guy, he had to do this.  In Buffalo, New York, the Dingus Day capital of the world, however, today there was actually  a demonstration called.  They held a Pussy Willow Pride rally.  And if you notice, there's a sign there that reads, Cooper is a pooper.  A saying which, by the way, I found funny in third grade and I still find funny to this 
[01:50:00]  day.  Cooper, pooper.  Anyway, what actually makes me sad about this is that I really hope those people at  that demonstration say, no, I was not calling Dingus Day stupid.  There are tons of quirky and little known cultural and religious celebrations in this  country.  And I enjoy them.  I think it's cool that we have them.  I think it's part of what makes this country so great.  Oh, stop.  Nothing wrong with making fun of some of this stuff, though.  You can say it's stupid.  Oh, God.  I mean, really.  What happened there?  You think the CNN bosses got to them?  Of course.  Yeah.  They got a complaint letter.  Let's just nip this in the bud. 
[01:50:30]  It's not worth it.  What should I say?  Well, I could apologize.  Yeah, but, you know, you're still going to get, oh, I got it.  Say that.  You're laughing.  You were making fun of that.  And then it makes these guys overthink everything.  Yeah.  You know?  Whatever.  You guys have heard the speech a million times.  I apologize.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  But that's today's apology.  There's one every fucking day.  Every fucking day there is one.  It's unbelievable.  The insincere apology.  Oh, my God.  Somebody has to say they're sorry every fucking day for a verbal slip or a misstep in a microphone. 
[01:51:00]  We demand an apology.  God almighty.  What fucking cunt this country is filled with.  I like the people that demand an apology.  It's like, really?  You think it's going to be sincere if you're demanding an apology?  I think no.  One groveling fucking moment after another.  One hurt feeling followed by groveling phony apology after another.  Yeah.  Ugh.  We're packed full. 
[01:51:30]  Literally, this country is ziplocked full of cunts.  Offended babies.  Just babies.  Hey, wait a minute.  Hey!  Wait a minute.  You weren't too sorry.  Fuck everybody.  Say you're sorry.  I'm sorry.  That's like little kids when you tell a little kid, say you're sorry and they go, I'm sorry.  Then they don't know what they're fucking sorry for.  They don't care.  Of course not.  It's just going through the motions. 
[01:52:00]  Right.  Yeah, why would you say that it's stupid that a bunch of people have a parade and tickle  each other with pussy willows?  Why would you say that's stupid?  And the guys throw water.  Fuck.  It's dumb.  It's all dumb.  I'm sorry.  I don't care if it's a religious ritual.  Yeah.  That makes it dumber.  I think we could put some beeps in there and make it really fun.  What do you think?  Oh, yeah.  Let's do some beeps with that.  I'm trying to think of what it would sound like.  Oh, yeah.  I think it could sound like they rubbed their cocks on the girls. 
[01:52:30]  How old are we?  Pussy.  Well, take out willow.  Yeah, just take out the willow part.  Take out the willow part.  So then it's all about pussy and cocks.  Yeah.  Pussy.  Pussy.  And cocks.  Hey, speaking of cocks, there's a restaurant that used to, used to, because there's a massive  lawsuit.  I don't know, man.  I think I'm fucked up.  Because these sexual harassment lawsuits just make me laugh every fucking time.  Sexual harassment.  They make me laugh every time, and I don't know. 
[01:53:00]  I think there's something wrong with me.  Because it's not sexual harassment.  Because I don't believe half this shit actually happens.  It's just never really sexual harassment.  I'll get to the part where this person's claiming, pushed his erect penis into my buttocks  area.  Oh, wait a minute.  That might be sexual harassment.  Come on.  Yeah, that might be.  That could be.  No, obviously that would be if it happened.  But it's hard for me to believe any of this stuff happens.  Yeah.  So there's a restaurant.  They're calling it Extra with two X's. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, like extra.  Sauce on the side.  Extra sauce on the side?  What is that supposed to mean?  And then it's phallic dumplings.  Phallic dumplings.  Kitchen workers at a celeb-packed Manhattan Chinese restaurant allegedly used a culinary  technique they don't teach at Le Cordon Bleu.  Le Cordon Bleu.  Making mock penises out of dumplings before serving them to diners.  Got an ex-bartender, bartender, excuse me, that has filed the lawsuit. 
[01:54:00]  Of course.  Looks like it's a female bartender.  Does the waiter also push the back of your head toward the plate?  See, get it?  Yeah, I liked it.  I did get it.  See, it was cute.  Yvonne says the disgusting displays were but one item on a menu of sexual harassment  and assault that she endured while working at Chin-Chan on the east side.  Wow, we can't even say, you can't say Chin-Chan.  You could say Chin-Chan. 
[01:54:30]  Can we say Chin-Chan?  We could say Ching-Chan.  Ching-Chan-Ching?  Yeah.  Can you say Ching-Chan-Ching?  You could say...  Yvonne claims the workers at the eatery, which boast customers such as Tyra Banks and J-Lo,  routinely use dumplings to make nasty food dicks.  Of course, they write fallacies here.  Oh, oh.  Putting them in their crotch areas, making it look like they had big penises, she writes 
[01:55:00]  in the lawsuit.  That's funny.  The Asians...  Please.  That's an Asian dying to do that.  Yes.  That's like every white kid fantasizing we can dunk.  What's wrong with that?  So, they would make the dumplings that look like phallic symbols or penises, and then  the dirty dumplings, according to this person, would then wind up on unsuspecting customers'  tables.  So?  Who cares?  I don't see...  If you're making a dumpling and you go like this, where your crotch is, and then you fucking 
[01:55:30]  fry it up, whatever the fuck, and throw it on my plate, I don't give a fuck.  I'd like a big...  Was it down his pants?  Then maybe I'd have a problem.  Yeah, that would be a problem.  I want a big dick dumpling.  What, do you want a small ball dumpling?  If you're buying a dumpling, you want more...  Big girthy cock dumpling is more dumpling for you.  Put foreskin on it.  That's more dumpling.  Foreskin.  And they must suck at making fake dicks, because no one noticed that their dumplings  looked like dicks.  Kitchen employees would, with no hesitation, prepare food to be served to the customers from  the very same dumplings that they used to make penises. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, no!  No!  The suit says...  Yvonne also alleges that owner Jimmy Chin boasted of overcharging Sean Diddy Combs for  a bathroom mirror that got broken during backroom taping of his show Making the Band.  So?  Gives a fuck.  So?  He overcharged fucking P. Diddy for a mirror?  Who gives a fuck?  And Chin, who she said occasionally used racist terms. 
[01:56:30]  Wow.  An Asian guy.  Oh no.  Using racist terms.  Once said it was a good decision to put Mariah Carey in a private section after she showed  up high on drugs, court papers say.  Who cares?  What's that got to do with anything?  She's just fucking trying to embarrass the restaurant.  Yeah, this has nothing to do with her suit.  Yvonne, which seeks unspecified damages, says she was repeatedly ogled and harassed by  porn-loving co-workers who watched x-rated movies in the kitchen every Sunday without  exception. 
[01:57:00]  This sounds like a great place to work.  That sounds like a pisser.  At least once a month, she says, some of the kitchen workers would approach her while  holding a pair of oranges to their chest and saying, nay-nays, nay-nays is very good.  Wow, they just have no clue about sexual harassment.  Yvonne also alleges she was repeatedly groped by at least two co-workers, one of whom pushed  his erected penis into her buttocks area.  Caught right!  Caught right!  Mm-hmm.  Of course, the owner denying, frivolous, ridiculous, nonsense, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:57:30]  And that's about it, I guess.  Wow.  That sounds fun.  Yeah.  I like it.  Yeah.  I'd go there.  Me too.  Oh, chin-chin is Japanese for cock?  I didn't know that.  Chin-chin?  You want to learn about the Japanese culture today yet?  Well, I think we all know it.  Bunch of degenerates.  Leo!  Yeah, what's up, man?  As far as sexuality goes.  What's up, brother?  Yeah, the chin-chin is definitely Japanese slang for cock. 
[01:58:00]  I used to yell at a Japanese chick when I was stationed there.  That's right.  Oh, good.  Good.  What a gentleman.  What a gentleman.  You used to yell cock?  Shut up, you fucking wop!  Whoa!  It'd be like walking around here and just going, cock!  Cock!  Cock!  So you'd say, not biting hair on my cocky cock cock?  Ah, Joe.  Oh, yeah.  I gotta keep up the image of our fighting forces, you know.  Yeah.  Alright, sir.  Cock!  I'm glad you enjoyed that.  Imagine what a woman would think if some Japanese guy was just running around yelling cock into their face. 
[01:58:30]  Right.  Like, that's exactly what's going on with this guy in Japan.  What are you gonna do?  Sometimes when people tell you bad words in a certain language, you use them not really thinking it's real.  Yeah.  Because it doesn't sound real to you.  You got one?  No, well, remember...  What's his name from...  I don't remember any bad words from other languages anymore.  Yeah, I'm trying to think.  I know a few.  Charmout.  Frenchy used to tell me some fucking shit.  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  Like salope and poufy ass.  What's that shit?  It's like fucking slut and gay, you know, fag kind of a thing.  And I would say it, and it didn't seem real, but then French people would get all, like, pissed off.  And I used it a couple of times when I saw, like, a couple walking down Broadway once and they were speaking French.  I could tell it was French just from that dumb sound.  And then I just went like, salope!  And they turned around. 
[01:59:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, it works.  It's like funny.  It's like a code word that kind of works.  It's cool.  It works.  Yeah.  Yeah, that other language stuff works.  Yield salope.  And I'll bet you another group turned around, too.  Oh, fuck it.  Jeff Goldblum's gonna be here in an hour.  Yes.  My God.  A big stod.  Yeah, a little nervous, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Goldblum's fucking huge, man.  Jurassic Park.  Jurassic Park, of course.  I hear he's doing Jurassic Park 4.  Rumor has it. 
[02:00:00]  Rumor has it.  I guess we'll get the skinny on that, won't we?  Much like we did with...  Who's the guy that was in here and we asked about a movie he was making and he wasn't?  Oh.  That was that guy.  It happens to every guest that comes in.  We think that they're doing a movie they're not.  That is true.  Something big is happening in the news that they won't talk about.  It's amazing.  We never get the scoop.  Never.  We suck at getting the scoop.  Oh, that's right.  Also, God, lest we forget, Independence Day.  Yep.  David, my son, David.  Whoa. 
[02:00:30]  He has been in some big movies.  His fucking resume is awesome.  My God, man.  They list his resume.  What about The Fly?  The Fly, that was very good.  I liked it.  He pulled out his fingernails.  I didn't mind The Fly.  Yeah.  His resume in the little playbill is, I think, up to like...  It's a partial resume.  His resume is just too long.  Oh, yeah.  He's been in a fucking shitload of movies.  He is.  Classics.  I think that was Edward Norton.  Travis just told me. 
[02:01:00]  We listed a bunch of things that he was working on and every single thing was wrong.  Oh, right.  It was Edward Norton.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  That one I remember specifically, Roland giving me the information.  Oh, no.  And he had to take the heat on it.  That's cool.  Jeff Goldblum, though.  He's kind of a weird guy.  We talked to him once before.  Yeah.  On the phone.  I've seen interviews with him.  But he laughed a lot.  Yeah, he did.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He does that laugh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, yeah.  JWoww is fucking... 
[02:01:30]  She turns me on.  JWoww's juicy.  Yeah, dude.  Even when we take a picture together, she really turns me on.  The boobs are a little tight, though.  I don't like the boob jobs where it looks like the girl's uncomfortable because they're  so tight in there.  That body feels good, though.  When you take a photo with her, man, she is fucking sexy.  She's silky.  What, were you squeezing her?  No, just standing next to her.  She's silky.  She's yelling cock at her.  Yeah.  She gives you the vibe that you might be able to have a shot, even though I know I don't.  That's what a sexy woman does.  She makes you think that you might be able to fuck her. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, is that how it works?  Yeah, but I know.  I can't.  Hey, where are we at with fatties having to be removed from their homes?  We got one.  Yeah, yeah, there's another one in a while.  They all get one.  One time.  One time.  Second time, fuck you.  Get out yourself.  But 600 pounds?  How do you get to 600 pounds?  Pounds.  Pounds, baby.  Pounds.  The only reason I did that is because stupid Jimmy looked at him and I was like, I can't 
[02:02:30]  help myself.  You looked at him.  Hey, what's the heaviest you've ever been?  Right now.  What is it?  You're the heaviest right now.  Wow.  Congrats, man.  How much are you?  230.  230.  And that confuses everybody.  Like, wait, you make it sound like he's like 400 pounds.  230?  Oh.  Where's Kenny?  No, that's kind of...  It's big.  That is kind of heavy, right?  You were 209 not long ago.  230 pounds is a lot. 
[02:03:00]  Because you're not like a big tall guy.  No.  It's not muscle.  How tall are you?  It's not muscle.  Sam's got to go, it's not muscle.  5'11", no 230.  You just insulted him more.  Are you working out?  Oh, shit.  Sorry, dude.  Are you working out?  Sorry, I was ignoring Sam.  Yes.  Oh.  Not a whole lot, but I've been doing the elliptical.  All right.  How about the true test?  Can you still see your dick in the shower?  Yes.  All right.  If there's a mirror.  Yeah.  Yeah, how big is that?  How big is that?  He's got a big giant ball sack, so that probably helps. 
[02:03:30]  You got big balls, huh?  You can see it when you rest it on the sink counter.  Big heavy sack full of fucking Prince Nagel seed.  Yeah, you won't give that shit up for anyone.  Why are you making fun of my fucking thing?  You can see it on the gold fixtures of the Nagel mansion in the shower.  Yeah.  You rest your balls on the sink, right?  No.  It's so much easier that way.  You break the ceramic.  That doesn't really make sense.  You have those big balls.  How tall are you?  Well, me?  I got a couple on you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's a height thing with that.  If you're a certain height, it's easier to just kind of hoist your balls up and rest 
[02:04:00]  them on the sink when you brush your teeth.  I don't see the correlation between resting your balls on the sink and brushing your teeth.  Because you lean up against the sink and it hits your balls.  You don't have to get that close to the sink.  I do, though.  How tall are you?  I want to rest my balls on this.  5'11"?  A little more than that.  Are you 6?  Yeah.  What are you at?  5'9"?  10.  Are you 5'10"?  Yeah.  I'm a shrimp.  How tall are you, Jimmy?  5'1".  I'm dainty.  Someone's petite.  Someone's petite.  I'm petite and dainty. 
[02:04:30]  Sweetie pie.  I'm a humble.  I'm about 5'6 and a half.  But the rest of the ball bag, I would say, aunt just misses that.  I think it's like a 5'10"-ish to about 6'1", 6'2".  You should back up.  Back that shit up.  I need to push up against something when I'm brushing my teeth.  Why?  I don't know.  You're humping the sink? 
[02:05:00]  No, I don't hump.  Does it feel nice on the bottom of your ball bag?  It does on your VazDevrens.  VazDevrens.  Do you feel the coolness of the counter?  No, because, I mean, you can make, yeah, whatever.  But, I mean, I have, like, my PJs on or my fucking underpants.  Sometimes you feel a little cool.  The counter's cool.  A little bit sometimes.  You'll feel the coolness of the counter.  Yeah, sometimes.  You know.  Yeah.  Or the heat of it if you just took a nice hot shower.  Oh.  Wow.  I could never sleep in PJs or just get all tangled. 
[02:05:30]  I know.  That just seems ridiculous.  If you have a kid in the bed, it's understandable because you're not...  Boy.  I don't know why I couldn't.  I always wore something to bed, I guess.  Did you sleep in Long John's?  That doesn't mean I was molested, Jimmy.  I don't think it does.  I'm gonna cut you off this time.  I don't think it means you're molested.  You thought I was because I wear socks to bed.  Yeah, exactly.  I know you were because of that.  Yeah.  Some of the fucking creepy neighbor would come in and start sucking your toes.  Exactly.  You had the nicest toes in the fucking block.  And they would smell like socks from basketball. 
[02:06:00]  Maybe that's why I hate fucking feet.  Yeah.  I hate feet.  Maybe that's why.  These women's feet do you hate?  I don't hate them, but it's not like I go fucking gaga over it.  I've gotten like...  I'm not a foot guy, but like if feet stink a little bit...  That's just the opposite.  No, no, no.  You like smelly feet.  I wouldn't say that.  Not cheesy smell.  Not like that's disgusting.  Oh.  But a little bit of a foot smell on a girl whose chemistry I like can turn me on a lot.  That's rough.  Underarm odor.  Like I don't like when a girl wears deodorant. 
[02:06:30]  You don't?  No.  What if it's unscented?  No, I don't want...  No, I want to smell her.  I like when it's a little raw and nasty.  Yeah?  Fuck yeah, man.  That turns me on a lot.  What about like a dirty asshole?  Where you at with that?  Not a dirty asshole, but a little tinge?  Like sweaty?  A little...  If the chemistry is good.  Armpits...  Period pits are gross.  They smell different.  They're oniony.  Are you kidding?  No, I can tell...  Believe me.  You want to know if a chick's on a period?  Have her fucking applaud over my head.  I'll tell you in two seconds.  Why? 
[02:07:00]  What's the difference?  It's an oniony smell.  It's a different odor.  You can tell.  I have an amazing sense of smell.  Yeah.  What are you fucking...  Hannibal Lecter?  I said, you were a lad to Tomp.  And she said, no, I just shit.  Not today.  No, I can...  Wow.  I like a fucking...  My ex, I always knew when she was on a rag.  Besides the fact that she was a cunt on wheels.  Because I could smell her pits and she'd be throwing something at me.  That's amazing.  So girls smell different to you.  Oh, God, yeah.  During their period. 
[02:07:30]  Their pits do, sure.  And the pussy does too.  Much different.  You ever break up with a girl because her smell wasn't right?  I've had...  What's that about?  That's gotta be like some fucking old school fucking caveman.  Animalistic thing.  You'd have retarded kids, so they kind of...  I absolutely blew off girls because I'm like, oh man, I really like her, but her smell's  off.  It's just off, right?  What is that?  The breath.  Some girls I've gone out with...  Not bad breath or anything.  I'm talking about her just natural scent.  I don't even mean bad breath.  I mean a smell that repels me.  Even I know they brush their teeth or the smell of their hair or their skin or the pussy. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, right?  That is nature, I think.  Just...  So you don't mind the asshole to be a little musty.  It depends on the girl, dude.  If I'm attracted to a girl, if I have that animal thing with her, I like the smell of  her pussy, her armpits.  Fresh breath isn't very important.  That's the only thing that has to be cleaned is the mouth.  But I like the fucking smell of the ass.  But if I'm not attracted to you, those smells will bother me.  Agreed.  You know?  Agreed.  So we got the 600 pound man.  And you're saying give these guys one, huh? 
[02:08:30]  One?  Maybe.  Because, you know, again, we all...  I can't...  As an addict, I can't be a hypocrite.  But by the second time, they should just fucking collapse the house on you like you're  a fucking suicide bomber in Palestine.  I'm starting to think this is a disease, by the way.  Yeah.  Because I've gone on eating binges, I'm sure we all have, but something in you goes,  oh, my God, I can't fucking eat anymore.  And these people will do that every fucking day.  And I don't...  I just...  I can't comprehend that.  You know?  Yeah.  I'll gorge myself like anyone else, but then if something hits me, I'm like, 
[02:09:00]  all right, I'm done.  Ugh.  You know?  Yeah, it is.  I mean, it's a hard one.  I don't know how I can eat that much food.  You don't like looking at the foot?  Oh.  Were you still on that?  Well, I was kind of going to jump in...  Oh, I...  Before Jimmy got into the smell of it.  I'm sorry, buddy.  No, it doesn't...  Because I think, like, a nice foot.  Yeah.  Smooth kind of...  It doesn't creep me out.  I'll look at a foot, but it's not that over-the-top turn-on.  I know, like, that's Keith's thing, right?  Keith likes feet and shoes and stuff.  Well, Keith likes shoes.  Oh, shoes?  Does he really? 
[02:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  He is a fruit when it comes to shoes.  A girl shoes.  He knows them all.  He gets deals for his wife.  He knows, like, shoe friggin' places and things like that.  Does he like certain shoes?  He gets turned on by a woman's shoes?  He notices, yeah.  He's a shoe fetter.  He's a shoe fetter.  Wow.  Like, when women walk up, he'll look right at their shoes...  Every time.  ...and know exactly which one it is...  No.  ...and knows how much they call it.  Fuck yeah.  Holy fuck.  He is an expert at shoes.  Is he a shoe licker?  I bet you Keith's a dirty shoe licker.  I don't know.  You think he's a dirty shoe licker? 
[02:10:00]  He's a fucking shoe boy.  In his cop uniform behind a dumpster somewhere in the village, licking some woman's...  some tranny's shoe?  Let me tell you something.  There are women, and I've known women who are dominatrixes, and there are guys who will  lick the bottom of their dirty shoe clean.  Really?  And I mean, after walking in New York.  Yeah.  Why?  Dude, I cannot comprehend that one.  Like, so there's a visible difference?  Like, there was visible dirt on the shoe in there?  They will lick the dungeon floor.  There are guys that will fucking lick the dungeon floor that will lick... 
[02:10:30]  Licking feet is one thing.  The dungeon floor?  Isn't that where the jizz goes?  Dude, it's where everything goes.  The piss, the shit, just dust.  They will lick...  It's like piss, shit, you know, dust.  Dust, wow.  Not dust.  Put your dust on your tongue.  They lick the bottom of shoes.  I don't get it.  What do you like about feet?  I don't hate it.  I think with the whole package.  I don't hate feet, but it's not like something I focus on too much.  With that whole package, it's part of the whole leg. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  I don't like like a...  I mean, it's cool to see a boot or something like that.  You like nice gams though with the calf muscle?  The whole leg is great when you can see the foot and then the whole leg, you know?  Right.  I don't like the body being broken up by too many things.  Like a belt or some kind of thing.  Like, I like head to toe.  New.  I don't want to see anything.  Well, I'm different than you in that.  I like the clothes.  I like some clothes.  Yeah, a little fucking thigh highs.  What are you, a fag?  No, no, no, no.  I just like to see the cock...  I mean... 
[02:11:30]  I just like to see the ass...  Son of a bitch.  My dad.  Spitting tobacco.  Son of a bitch.  Be all mad.  He used to say this one too.  Shit, piss, and corruption three times over.  Three times over.  Really?  No.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Shit, piss, and corruption three times over.  Why three times over?  Because it was really fucked.  Ah.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  I just remember him always being mad. 
[02:12:00]  Always like being mad or pissed at something.  I guess I'm a chip off the old block.  What's that?  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  God, how can I still fall for that shit?  Ah!  All right, so there you go.  Feet and musty assholes.  And musty assholes.  I wouldn't say musty, but there are even times...  We're earning our pay today, Sam.  You sure are.  There have been times where an ass was musty, where I would just...  I would... 
[02:12:30]  And I'm not being gross.  I would just...  The smell of it would turn me on.  Yeah.  But if the girl was right, if it's not the right girl,  fucking I want to fire hose it out.  I absolutely don't have a problem with that.  Yeah.  As long as it's slight.  Yeah, a little bit.  It can be a little...  A little.  It can be funky.  Yeah.  You don't have to smell like she was fucking...  You know, like she fucking was smuggled in from another country on an 18-wheeler.  You know, for three weeks in the back of a truck.  Or a fucking container from Russia.  Would you do that, though, for the story?  Eat that ass? 
[02:13:00]  I couldn't, because the smell would make me sick.  It would, right?  But a nice ass with a little fucking...  A little tinge of fucking...  Ooh.  Well...  Ooh.  We had to get a guy out of a house.  600-pound man rescued at a Pennsylvania home.  Has Matt Cruz spent hours rescuing a 600-pound Pennsylvania man after cutting a hole?  It's amazing.  They got to cut a hole in the side of your house to get you out.  Cut a hole in the side of the fucking house.  Fuck.  Holy fuck.  You fat fuck. 
[02:13:30]  The station reported that the man required medical attention was delivered to a nearby  hospital on a flatbed truck.  How embarrassing.  And the people he lives with should be killed.  He's not going out for food.  How's he getting it?  The enablers.  The enablers.  The enablers.  You see it in their eyes.  The enablers.  You see it in their eyes when they do these shows, and you could see the enablers like,  well, now I got nothing to do with my life.  Oh, yeah.  What's my role?  Oh, my God.  What?  My whole role was to feed this fat fuck.  There was a show on...  It's called My 600-Pound Life. 
[02:14:00]  And it's these 600-pound people, and they follow them for about seven fucking years they've  followed them.  Wow.  And they go through their stomach stapling.  They went 20 feet.  They almost made it to the end of the driveway.  Yeah.  They go through the stomach stapling thing, and then they kind of document their losing  weight.  And there was a husband, and his wife was a big fat mess, 600 pounds, and she started  losing weight.  This husband did not know what the fuck to do.  He was completely the enabler. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  He was actually getting pissed that she was losing weight.  He was trying to feed her, like, fatty foods and everything.  He was just a fucking asshole.  A selfish cocksucker worried that he's going to be left.  Me, me, me.  Look at these fucking slobs.  Is this the story?  Yeah.  They have video of them cutting a hole inside the house.  Oh, when you need Sawzall.  And you know it smells.  They had to take the siding out, the brick.  Oh, fuck.  Holy fuck. 
[02:15:00]  Can we put this on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony?  Hey, did that mailbox say Nagel?  What?  It said Pennsylvania, not Florida.  Oh, oh, I'm sorry.  Florida.  There was a boat in the back here.  Pretty cool, huh?  Do you think that's embarrassing?  Oh, God.  Big fucking fatso.  That's all they have?  They don't have him actually being removed?  Get off the fucking flatbed.  Yeah, I don't think...  That's too bad.  Where's the fat fuck?  They have hazmat.  If people have to wear astronaut uniforms to go in your house, you're a piece of shit. 
[02:15:30]  That should be the rule.  What else was in that house that they had to do the hazmat?  It could have been for him.  Probably food and his fucking fat smell.  Kind of a hoarding situation probably, right?  Of course.  That's the rule.  If people can leave your house and go right into interstellar space without a change of clothing,  you're a piece of garbage.  We're trying to see if there's a video of this guy. 
[02:16:00]  Why wouldn't you have the video of removing the fat guy through a hole in the house?  I know.  I would love to see that.  That's the money shot.  You've always heard of it, but I've never actually seen it.  Yeah.  They just lifted the house and tipped him out like a big fat pinball.  Did they have to put him in a harness and like...  It seemed like it.  They had a pulley system and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  If they're using pulleys, they had to like literally pulley him up.  Around the neck.  Just drag him out like a giant fucking sea animal.  Use the forklift like they did that poor cow. 
[02:16:30]  Where they just rolled the cow on the floor with the forklift.  PETA had some footage of that.  Oh, right.  Yeah, it was pretty mean.  Wow.  I'd rather see it done to a big fat guy than a poor little cow.  Yeah, just pull him out by his feet.  They should hang him naked by his feet from a crane and just scold him in front of the  neighborhood and let everybody come over and give their opinions as the fucking couch  is stuck to his hiney.  It's stuck to his hiney.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I hate this shit with the animals.  I know.  I don't like that.  Oh, look.  They're lifting up a cow with a forklift. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, that's mean.  What's wrong with him?  He's a cow.  Why are they lifting him?  Is he sick?  It's very hard to...  Is she?  I don't know.  It might be.  I think before they die, they got to bring him to the slaughter so they can fucking  use him.  Terrible.  So the meat's tasty.  A lot of times if a cow is dying, they'll make sure they slaughter him before he dies  because you can't use him after he's dead.  So he can eat cow cancer?  I think it's mostly for like dog food and shit.  I don't think...  Yeah, fuck the dogs. 
[02:17:30]  Fuck the dogs.  Many people.  Poor thing.  How about we break?  Aw.  Cows are just such sweet little animals.  I know.  They just all...  Unfortunately, they're delicious.  They had to be so tasty.  A downer cow.  What's a downer cow?  That's one.  Bummed out.  That's just...  It's an emo cow.  A little bummed out.  I'm depressed.  I'm sad today.  I'm sad today.  He's just shoving effectsor down his throat.  We're gonna just lay here today.  Supposed to be downed cow.  You know, when I was living in western New York, you knew when it was gonna rain because 
[02:18:00]  of the cows.  Really?  What happened?  It's true.  They have umbrellas?  They sit the fuck down.  Why?  They feel it in their joints, I guess.  But when you see the cows sitting down, you know the rain's a coming.  A chronic cow?  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Someone back me up on this, please.  I'm not backing you up on this.  You're right.  Sam, you don't know.  Yes, I do.  You know nothing about the country.  And I did go cow tipping once. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  It's horrific.  How much do you tip a cow?  It's horrific.  You run full speed with a bunch of guys and tip them over.  Yeah.  I was just a kid, Sam.  Aw.  It's horrific to hear them fucking not be happy about it.  Yeah, they fell over.  I'd be pissed too.  Yeah.  I'm glad you feel bad about it.  Oh, yeah.  That one I do.  I kind of like animals.  You do?  Yeah, I do.  I'm a big fan of the animal. 
[02:19:00]  Ant likes animals more than people.  Oh, I do.  I'm not even joking.  Don't joke it.  I am a fag for any of those goddamn kitten videos on YouTube and stuff.  And I'm not, you know, I guess I'm not going out on a limb.  There can't all be girls watching those things.  But there is just nothing more adorable than watching a fucking kitten video.  They're playing, and they hunch their back, and they're all scared, and they're on all fours, and then they bounce sideways.  They bounce sideways.  Yeah.  That's adorable.  Did you ever see the one where-  Look, they're playing with toilet paper. 
[02:19:30]  This is so cute.  Did you ever see the one where the little kitten had the hat on, and the mother swatted it off?  Adorable, right?  Did you ever see that one?  I don't think so.  Did you find that?  You can't-  Was it a black cat?  No, it's-  Hat removal.  That's funny.  Cat hat removal.  Look at this.  Oh, no.  He's wearing a little hat.  A little derby, right?  Look at the mother gets freaked out.  The-  Holy shit!  Wow!  Oh, man!  How-  What the fuck?  How does that only have 310,000 views? 
[02:20:00]  It's probably-  Wouldn't it go up an hour ago?  She didn't know what else was on this head.  Oh, that's so sad!  I want to hold a kitten.  It's been a long time.  I like the little kitten smell where you smell the back of a kitten's neck, and you bite  its head off.  Yeah.  I like to pet them, and they purr and shit.  Yeah.  There's one in that new movie, Five Year Engagement.  Meow!  They show a cat video.  Yeah.  And it's this cat that, like, does a bear hug to another cat and shoves him, you know, 
[02:20:30]  backwards.  Yeah.  It's pretty funny.  Oh, they're trying to get up the stairs.  We laughed and laughed at that one.  Oh, they are really cute.  Kittens are just adorable.  I want to make a cute kitten video.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Get a bunch of fucking views.  Yeah, I want to have a kitten climbing something, and then, just as a, like, thirty seconds  in, you just show my face.  I'm going...  Oh, it's laying on its little back, its feet are together. 
[02:21:00]  He's dreaming.  And his little arms are going like crazy.  I think there are more kitten videos on the internet than anything.  They are very cute, aren't they?  Very kissing.  kissable. People love  the kitten. That is so small  too. It's in someone's hand.  No, it wasn't? Yeah, that was in someone's hand.  Wow.  There's a little four-week-old kitten learning how to  walk. They all have 
[02:21:30]  hundreds of thousands of views  at the very minimum. Most of them  have millions of views.  Why don't we try to make one for real? A kitten video?  Yeah, can we get some kittens in here? Let's have kitten day.  Kitten day. That's a good way  to get some ratings. And we're having dead dad audio  day. Those are two bits we should be doing.  I have to find audio. It's in California.  Let's do that kitten day.  Who can bring in a shitload of kittens  and we're going to try to make a viral video? See, it's cradled  in a hand. I want to pet a kitten.  Do you really?  I do. I haven't pet a kitten in so long. 
[02:22:00]  I'll get a very allergic. Bobo's  boyfriend, Kurt Love,  has kittens. Really?  Really. Yeah. So how about it brings them in?  I don't know if they're boyfriend,  boyfriend, but I know they're fucking.  Oh, okay. Yeah. Alright. Well, lovers.  Can we call them lovers? Who fucks who? Bobo's lover.  Kurt Love. Oh, uh, Bobo does  the fucking. So why don't we give him some boy butter?  He's a top. Boy butter.  That's actually a great idea. Why not?  A right? I need some boy butter, Kurt. A right?

[02:35:00]  pushed me and i just laid this this kid out and i started i literally what i was doing security for  them so i took the kids he i got on top of him i started banging his head off the ground  well it fucked him up pretty bad and uh it was it was my friends i was doing security at my friend's  venue slash skate park and he was just really disappointed it just i know i fucked this he was  disappointed well yeah because of course he was caving in the skulls of a client because he had to deal  with the lawsuit yeah of course there wasn't a lawsuit luckily but it just it fucked me up mentally 
[02:35:30]  and i i really try to avoid fighting if i can well i'm gonna split your skull  i want to talk to you guys about a couple things that's okay at a club skate park what the fuck is  that kenny would be a tough one man kenny would beat you the only thing the only thing the only  advantage i think i would have is maybe stamina but if he connected with me right off the bat i'd be  fucked he's a monster troy wanted to destroy something beautiful that's good that's good

[02:51:30]  meisner too like what's the difference between that  and say like what brando took method acting what's the what's the what's the  technique difference  that's a very interesting question um  oh you know  they all came out of the group theater um  strassburg and stella adler and um  and meisner  uh and then they differed in a little bit of their this is inside baseball stuff  in their technique you know um so they they they did but they all came out of 
[02:52:00]  that in the thirties uh... if you know the group theater  there's a wonderful book called the fervent years that that uh...  that's all about that stanislavsky was doing what he was doing in moscow around  that time and they changed american acting  uh... in the thirties  six and i guess it's it's too boring to go into the details of how  strassburg and meisner kind of parted  uh... theoretical ways uh... but you know basically all those modern actors 
[02:52:30]  are trying to we're trying to do some a little different than what had been done  before whereby they make it a more authentic  lived out  the actor experienced story so you really feel like you're not just being  some presented with an actor but you know when brando first walked on stage  people said jeez is that a stagehand who has just wandered on the stage it was a  little more  true to life you know that kind of that amazes me that that there's  it's so much work and and uh... studying  to just look natural  we were talking about it jim jim uh... was talking about seeing you uh... in your 
[02:53:00]  play  seminar  seminar  and just saying  last night  you did you saw it last night  yeah it was great  thank you for coming  yeah  how great and natural it was is what jimmy was uh...  saying your acting is uh... yeah  it was amazing when you uh... because i watch  because i i panic when i have to act and i just kind of stand all stiff and  shit  and i watch somebody who's so good  i watch your hand motions and and it's very natural  the way you gesticulate and talk and i'm like that's just how he is probably  off  you don't feel like you're watching somebody act you just feel like you're 
[02:53:30]  watching a guy talk to four different people on stage it's really  interesting to watch  very sweet thank you and it was funny  and it's funny isn't it yeah it's it's uh... at the golden theater it's 90  minutes it's a lot of laughs people are naked and there's some girls  yeah  there's sex going on  and um... i love the play teresa rebeck wrote it uh... a brilliantly  talented smart funny author and sam gold who if people don't know is a is a hot  and spectacular young director he's done a few things on right now he was 
[02:54:00]  great to work with and then that cast i'd be remiss if i didn't  mention hetty and park and jerry o'connell whom you know  and justin long and zoe lister jones  they're fantastic jimmy said justin long was great they were yeah and i  didn't know the and so was jerry i didn't know the the women's names but  i will say the best nipple i've probably ever seen  mine well yeah well that kind of went without saying i mean  after yours the second you're talking about uh yeah  uh wow that's high high praise indeed coming from you  what made it the best nipple though it was just 
[02:54:30]  thick and i noticed it from the third row i hit bob kelly  i'm like that's the best fucking nipple i've ever seen  i click out of the play for a second dude i couldn't stop looking at her and  it was just so sexy when she just didn't have the slow fade into the uh  oh sorry john this is how you we hope not to  vote to diminish or vulgarize what you do but hetty and park is a master artist  herself that's sexy and saying yes she is sexy  do you do a lot of theater uh over the over the years have you done a lot of  theater you know i started doing theater even before  death wish right around that time i had done 
[02:55:00]  uh... two gents this musical of two gentlemen of verona at the saint james  theater with raul julia  and uh... then they'll grind at a coca-cola this funny show and then  through the years some other things few other broadway shows the  so you're a song and dance man too well i wouldn't say that  really i love music music is part of my life though i play piano i have a jazz  band in los angeles called the mildred schnitzer orchestra  and when i'm there and not working we play out and about  you know i play with really great musicians if you're out there you should 
[02:55:30]  come to see where we are it's it's fun who's in the band with you at one  point somebody i just read something somebody said they were  well peter weller originally kind of started it you know we were in a movie  together uh... you know buck rubanzai we met and we started to play it but  there are a lot of group but uh... he's since married as a kid recently and  has gone off but the core group keeps changing a little bit but i play with  great musicians anthony wilson has played with us recently as a  premier guitar player right now brilliant uh... musician plays with diana krull 
[02:56:00]  uh... right now and some other guys are just great you're great at too and i  like watching you talk you're great at doing there's a couple of amazing  monologues you have  and it i i've never seen anybody so good at just taking words  and making them  his it's like watching you talk right now is exactly  like watching you talk when you act it's  fucking  depressing it's so good it's depressing  and i'm watching for it you're depressing jimmy no but i mean that in a good way  yeah yeah just take these it's effortless but it's effortless it's 
[02:56:30]  effortless these weird pacing moments  yeah and not delivering like you know i just go line line line period line line  line line period watching the way you you your cadence and your pacing is  great man thank you so so much you know i'm a humble student at it i'm  trying to get better at it but it fascinates me it always has i teach  myself uh... out in california whenever i'm not working for the last 20 30 years  and i'm a kind of craft geek you know i i love to figure out how to 
[02:57:00]  it seems simple and it's you know it may on a certain level it might be simple  you know we're talking we show up we  can do things it's uh... it seems like it's talking but really  when you see people do it on a high level not necessarily myself but it's what  excites me and what i might what i'd love to strive for  is uh... it's it's it's it can be a refined beautiful thing i've seen acting  that has changed my life and had teachers that have changed my life certainly this  play is about a teacher i have my teacher in it 
[02:57:30]  and there are people who want to be creative artists in this case writers  two guys and two girls and that's what it's all about it's about the serious  uh... business of training  people for something serious especially in the creative arts but anything i  suppose if you're a soldier or if you're a  an athlete as we know you know if you want to be  on the highest level  the you they're all it's a very elite group that gets winnowed down and the  first qualification i think before we know 
[02:58:00]  even if you're specially gifted and talented which you finally have to be  is if you've got the entry-level qualification of commitment  and you're wildly passionately enthusiastic and for some crazy reason  and it's irrational you're in love with it like  and you can't live without it you want it so badly i remember my father saying  you can taste it that's the only reason he you should act he knew he knew about  that he he told me that uh... and he said if you find this  something you love to do that's what to do and somehow i was 
[02:58:30]  gifted with that early on  um... it's not with talent or anything but with this idea with a singular and  passionate idea when i was a kid that came upon me i don't know i i  i was watching i don't know how i i you know that they took to see children's  theater or whatever but i got this idea and by the time i was in high school i  taken a course or two in the summer  i would it would became a kind of a secret for me and every  morning when i took a shower the the steam would appear on the door  and while i was in there i'd write please god let me be an actor 
[02:59:00]  well and then before i left i would erase it i was absolutely obsessed with it  and that's basically what i as the key character and the teacher in this show  i'm trying to find out and let them find out about themselves if that's what  they're made of i keep saying at the end the last line of the play is do you  want to be a writer or not and it's what i can use that's  basically my theme as i continue i'm a very tough teacher  and i beat them up  what what what did you just give away the play no he doesn't  well not really it's all it's the fun is getting there you know and i'm 
[02:59:30]  i'm a terrible teacher and they they it's very painful for them and they  misconstrue it and they go is this guy awful is he a villain is he trying to  just beat us down or what but in fact i'm tearing off band-aids ego  band-aids and all kind of things in order to get to that basic  question and get them ignited into a commitment you said something  in there uh whose performance blew you away  you said some through the years yes one maybe we would know because i would  assume you probably see a lot of stuff we oh you know yeah yeah well you know maybe 
[03:00:00]  one me well you know when i was a kid like i said i saw children's theater  and just the guy playing you know uh you know beauty and the beast i was like  what is he doing what's he doing backstage and stuff but once i got a  little familiar with it oh geez i was thinking last night again  about um brando now that we mentioned him you know um on the waterfront  you know a lot of people will tell you they became actors because that that's not  true with me but you know once you know about it and once you see him do it 
[03:00:30]  it's endlessly fascinating it was it was such a change between the acting that had  gone on and was accepted as acting before  and then after that much more real afterwards and before it was this kind of  uh over-the-top theater kind of uh acting  yes most mostly you know talented people would emerge here and there  but he was distinct and it was a landmark and when he started to do what he did  and it was because of a change in time and sensibility and you know modern art  was happening in the other arts things were progressing and uh therapy and we 
[03:01:00]  understood more about the psychology of the individual and were more  deeply interested in that and all manner of things so but it it changed it  changed yeah isn't that fascinating but i liked early on peter sellers i was  thinking about peter sellers earlier oh yeah don't you love him who's great in  being there i mean he had some phenomenal stuff  what a great movie how about lolita i love him in lolita oh yeah yeah you know  what i love men do you know the i'll bet you know this movie after the fox i was 
[03:01:30]  talking about it last night no it's vittorio de sica directed it's neil  simon's first screenplay he's in it it's from a kitsch  period in the 60s burt back rack does the music he sings with the hollies in  fact for those trivia experts the theme song after the fox the fox is me but  that's not it uh but it's hilarious i saw when i was a kid with my sister in  pittsburgh at the leona theater and but i see it and my dresser at the  show said i remember that movie i was eight years old when i first see 
[03:02:00]  saw it and i haven't found that since in my adult life i had a copy of it and i  gave it to him last night uh i love that you're absolutely uh a  student of acting and uh because there are there are some actors that are just  like well i go up there and i just you know  make believe for a while but you you know obviously obviously take it very  seriously um and still have fun with it do you like  do you like a role like like you're doing now in in the the show or  or one of those blockbuster kind of independence day roles  that you know obviously storyline and and character development isn't as 
[03:02:30]  um important but it's it's a blockbuster yeah well it's nice to be in  something that everybody sees and is excited about it's  finally it comes up in the show i say you know you can be a brilliant writer  but if you're doing it and you're if you don't if you keep it in your drawer  nobody sees it you know that's not the point what we're doing here really and you  may consider yourself brilliant and oh it's just for me  but no no no let's disabuse ourselves of that idea  especially if it's brilliant let people see it so it's nice and gratifying to 
[03:03:00]  be in a popular thing you know and in fact those particular  shows spielberg he's yes there may have been dinosaurs in it  but the parts that i was in he was very attentive to he's  brilliant and refined and character oriented and actor savvy and actor  passionate and so it was creative and uh but you know you put a little mosaic  mosaic piece here and there one day after another and it's creative and fun in a  different way this i find this particular show 
[03:03:30]  a real um first-class conditioning exercise for myself and workout there's a  great i'm sorry there's a great there's a great monologue where you kind of deconstruct  uh uh justin long's character and you kind of paint what it is that he's doing and it was  really well written and it said so much about like you just said people just want to keep it  for themselves instead of uh exposing it was really really well written and well uh performed thank  you i love that it's been fun to work on that like a little you know you know sculptor sculpting 
[03:04:00]  project you keep kind of detailing and finding out more about it because it's brilliant writing because  it's kind of ambiguous it could mean a lot of different things but yes it's an interesting moment  in the show an event you know he's like there's this brilliant justin long plays a brilliant  writer that i recognize but i also recognize the young me in him me the character is i've sabotaged my  self with some personal uh problems and ego and narcissism and you know unsociability and this old 
[03:04:30]  antiquated idea that if you're brilliant you have the right and even obligation to be screwy  and you can't put you you can't have time for put up with regular people and da da da da and  jd salinger is our hero and you have to disappear somehow i say no no no man you're really  off base there and in fact you've got these ideas i tell him because i'll paint you a picture of 
[03:05:00]  what's going to happen he has just blown this opportunity i've just given him not to give him  anything away but i've just you know finally he's shown me his work he's been hiding all this time in  class he shows me his work i say this is absolutely brilliant i recognize it immediately and i say i want  to see everything you've ever written we're gonna i'm gonna work on this he says no you're terrible you're a  terrible teacher you're you've taken too many drugs you're abusing us this guy is horrible i'm not 
[03:05:30]  and so right he not only am i and then he says this thing to me which was the crux of my undoing  career-wise in fact went for the jugular he went for you he hits below the belt and i'm very hurt i'm  very sensitive myself and so i with a fierce truth assault i attack back on him but show him  what this kind of personal quirk and self-destructiveness will lead to in his life because i know all  too well and then i say and because you just did it here this was the main thing i offered you the 
[03:06:00]  biggest opportunity that you're ever going to have and you have blown it so wake up pal something  about it it's like seeing part of the play i know it's that it's so intense yeah it's like i mean i'm  fixated i know what's the first thing you do when you see a script i always ask great actors  that like when you get a script what do you do like okay i'm gonna play leonard uh what do you  do from there how do you how do you memorize the lines first or do you think about the guy  that i have no formula you know after all this time i've been being able to tell people what to do 
[03:06:30]  and there's some meat and potatoes things you can follow but finally it's a creative you know it's  a little project an endeavor and i myself have no formula uh each one you suggest something different  you know and uh you know you read it and yeah things will start to occur to you oh i know about  this i know about this guy here's a doorway i can go through i'm interested in this part of it this  aspect of the character how to make this funny why this why he's doing that uh how this is like my 
[03:07:00]  life how i understand that how is how this is like somebody else i know and then yes i start i i learn  it early on too i like to know the words i know there are actors who and there are techniques where  you can go oh you know i'm not gonna i'm not gonna learn the words too early and that there's a  there's something in that but it's also a an excuse for laziness too and there are pitfalls in learning 
[03:07:30]  it you don't want to become mechanical you want to be flexible you want to get with the other actors  and then adjust to them and adjust to the ideas of the director but you can avoid those somehow too  and i find from the day i get the part there are things that i can do that take up my whole day  you you have a quite a unique way of speaking and body language and over the years people have uh  people have imitated you do you have a sense of humor about yourself have you seen these and and  enjoyed them i'm always uh uh yeah it's always funny yeah i like them all yeah who do you know do 
[03:08:00]  you know do anybody here is a friend of mine eli gold's fantastic he's been very sweet to me uh  i love his impersonation it's very good does it does it is it odd to look at someone's interpretation  of you and go do i do that yeah it is it is you don't do it you don't do it i don't do impressions  no i'm a sucker for i like any impressions i like all impressionists oh i don't do any you know 
[03:08:30]  i do i do one of mediocrity no you're fantastic kevin spacey i did a play with him recently  in london and he's a master impersonator he does the only william hurt that i've ever seen oh wow  really oh it kills me it cracks me up i love him who else is uh what's his name the actor from uh  usual suspects um well i know kevin pollack kevin pollack is very good duke company oh my god  dude on snl right that was a famous one i think he did it here when he was in mind with us he did 
[03:09:00]  yeah i think so yeah really was he good yeah it was pretty goddamn good he's pretty good man i love  when elon does and i think it's the only time i'll think of the impression when i'm listening to you  because you'll go but but and elon does this great no and it's a brilliant thing for him to have  caught like that's what impressions do they catch something that somebody does that you just wouldn't  think of when you're doing the impression that's what made it so unique and great yeah yeah good i  know i i love it it's like christopher walken there's very few actors who are so interesting 
[03:09:30]  that anything they do you just want to hear their interpretation of it like i like literally i want  to hear how jeff goldblum is going to do this or do that and there's very few guys nicholson's one  of those guys that's interesting enough walk in yourself there's very few you're so sweet to  sure i love chris walker chris walk and i have been in here's a trivia question four movies together  we've never had a scene together we've come to know i love to hang around him he's he's i get a big  kick out of him but um yeah we've been informed think of even one movie that that you were in that he 
[03:10:00]  was in i'm not gonna cheat we know he was not in the deer you were not in the deer i was not in the  deer no okay king of new york i was not in king of new york that was a guess but a question i see i  i'd say the judges say that's a guess you've used that one yes that's a tough one were they earlier  films from films we should know years ago yes was not an independence day he was not in jurassic park 
[03:10:30]  that's he was not in uh the fly he was not in uh death wish yeah i'm trying to think about now that  i've said it i know it's for i'm trying to remember which ones they were yeah i'll go over  and don't google it don't don't we have uh we have donald sutherland here the other day  i've done two movies with invasion of the body snatchers that's correct fantastic that movie still  holds up it still holds up it's a great uh uh well it was well yeah thank you so much i agree i uh not 
[03:11:00]  because me but i like phil kaufman the director is uh spectacular and donald sutherland leonard  nemois yeah leonard nemois was in that i like playing the movie game you know it goes actor  movie actor movie you know it's like the kevin bacon game you don't have to get back to him  so name an actor or a movie any actor or any movie carrie oldman okay now we have to name a movie that  he's been in i say you know i say batman wasn't he in that last yeah yes he was okay which takes us to  christian bale christian bale which takes us to the oh what's the movie where he lost a lot of weight

[03:12:00]  tell you judd and judd hirsch who played my father and i ran into him at uh at joe allen's so he played  of course in ordinary people ordinary people with yes with timothy hutton and he was in  and sutherland stay with you uh with independence day which takes to will smith which takes us to  by the way do you think judd hirsch set back uh the jewish movement uh 50 years in that movie  certainly not david my son david we have also gone on that uh ad nauseam david my son david there was 
[03:12:30]  just a delicious touch of humantashen in his in his part it was very beautiful this is not checkmate  this is not checkmate you'd all be dead if it wasn't for my david yeah that was the one oh oh boy  i just looked at something now now you know one of the movies we were stuck on uh we went to uh we  went to uh we went to ordinary people we went to will smith that takes us men in black i love men in

[03:28:00]  why not you have some leakage i'm always giving myself courtesy wipes you get a lot of swamp aspect  there well just to avoid it is that is that because it's been stretched out or why is that  not like i haven't sat on a mirror and looked up my asshole lately yeah but i probably have some of  them they're hemorrhoids gotcha any pain or bumpy texture coming from there no no pain well that's 
[03:28:30]  okay then but you so you think you have the type of hemorrhoids where they just open up your asshole  and make shit leak out yeah it's so you can't you know i and i use wet wipes what does that have to do  with anything to clean up oh i see i see um but you're saying troy if a chick is hot enough like  how hot does a chick have to be for you to lick her butthole while there's and but there is a remnant  or two on there i mean troy eats ass i again you have all this information that a lot of us are not 
[03:29:00]  privy to i don't know what you guys talk about or do in that little studio of his but you have a lot  of information well let's talk about your ass eating habits i was talking to troy and you  interrupted to mention no we don't know it's established troy's an ass eater what about you  troy how hot does the chick have to be see why won't he answer the question because sam doesn't  eat ass i've i've answered it a hundred times on the air he doesn't eat ass he doesn't seem like the  kind of guy that would eat ass i've said that on the air many times before no no offense dude you 
[03:29:30]  seem like a very vanilla kind of lover that's right i don't take offense to that yeah so he's not he's not  fucking opening up an ass like a head of lettuce you know what i mean and diving in where you know  if the girl's hot you know i mean if you have to be like how hot does she have to be for there to be  some remnants like and you're okay with that like model hot like name one person and it's a celebrity  i just got a text message somebody's calling me names who  oh a person who is it no it's a it's a very nice person oh my god troy

[03:32:30]  guy yeah what are you doing in there keep texting me people shut up what are you doing in there it was  getting too hard to see through the window so why because kenny kept spitting all over with his  halitosis why why do you give people the wrong impression of me i got good hygiene do you oral  hygiene too yeah oral anal yeah but your your anal hygiene you have problems that you need to take  care of that's what that is he leaks yeah he leaks we've established that no i give myself courtesy

[03:33:30]  it's like would you like to hear them cover a metal song so it was like it goes along with what they  do or do you want like when bands cover a song that's not in their genre not in their format going  outside the box yeah so what do you want to hear uh hmm i have to think because you're the guy  uh oh let's see if they can do uh uh that childish gambino song heartbeat that would be  a tough song for them to do yeah i mean that's a lot of i mean they'd probably do like a like

[03:36:30]  they they came up to me and they were like this song this is our song what do you think eric  i think this song yeah i think this song might be big i mean it's catchy but i think this will be her  only yeah it's not like she's not a special artist it sounds like something else and it's driving me  crazy i'm trying to sound it sounds like everything else yeah yeah it's not special it's it's if i wasn't  there doing got the picture just want to throw that in rolling gets credit i go excuse me  roland hooked it up roland's a man roland roland always takes care of pictures but you're thinking

[03:37:30]  uh i guess they'll play it on hitbound because that's their new song show yeah and see if it  picks up steam they look at the charts they go crazy trying to figure out what to play in this station  they spent hours figuring out what's charting and stuff yeah exactly where they know what's up yeah i  mean they do a good job they have bruise so i wish they played a little more urban but you got  to think turn on 20 on 20 hits one is programmed for all of america and i'm going to tell you 
[03:38:00]  something right now troy a lot of america and i mean a lot of america feels the way uh a lot like  anthony cumia feels right in that when they turn on a pop station they don't want a lot of urban  influence you know what the song is right now whale featuring big sean slight work have you heard  that one yeah pop track that that's that's that's diplo beat it's sick that's my that's my  right now but that's not going to yeah yeah this would never be on hits one wait to hear this beat  this is sick i mean there's a song like this every three months that's hot pirate trucker hey sam you 
[03:38:30]  don't know shit about music troy is exactly right that first song yeah yeah call me maybe  teenage girls and herself that thing is going to be so fucking huge and annoying it's going to be 
[03:39:00]  ridiculous it's going to be one of the songs big songs of the summer it might be it might not though  i mean it's not like anybody could come out with something all of a sudden if katie perry comes out  with a new song she'll beat it yeah but it's cute it's and everything it's something that people  like a pirate trucker i don't like it but it's going to be annoying all summer yeah but it's  got to be more than you know there are a lot of catchy songs that don't pick up yeah but you know  what makes a good song is something that can it's not just a catchy hook but something that people can 
[03:39:30]  say to each other in in everyday life yeah you know what i mean like so it could be like hey call  me maybe you know like you're out and you're like you're on a t-shirt exactly yeah i got you uh tom in  allentown allentown represent i usually hate troy but i gotta i gotta back him this song's  fucking awesome you like it and why are you gonna hate me man i'm born and raised in allentown  bro you're old fucking six foot four 250 pound man i fucking love this good you're down with call  me maybe put it eric put it on again for for tom you liked it by the way but whatever tim wow 
[03:40:00]  whose screen you call is in there who is it nobody is is it paul the moron yeah man yeah that's  why you're psyched 30 million uh hits on that shit and i'll tell you that's what's got everybody  psyched about this song too is there's a video with all these little pop stars running around  dancing to it kenny put the put the headphones on crank it up 
[03:40:30]  what do you think penny who's this rebecca black it is no it's better than rebecca black but it's  not that much better no this girl can actually sing she did an acoustic performance here and  actually sang rebecca black couldn't say i think you're worth it did you see who i walked down the  hall with no steve sterniello from the rock dog so what so what he works here he walks down the hall  all day yeah but i walked with him what do you think of this song and i just went down and and looked uh 
[03:41:00]  peeked my head in the meeting wait oh what was going on i saw anthony waving affirmatively hey like  not you know eric not erock you're on after open anthony live hey what's up guys i was coming to let  you know that song was number one on the radio disney countdown this weekend when i was listening to it  with my daughter it was she's 10 that's still good wow that's one of their songs crack it up of course 
[03:41:30]  would you let your daughter hang out with troy  no no no it's probably not a good idea he's obviously a pedophile thank you sam look pete  dominic's on cnn right so what he's a cnn correspondent yeah but he's also on siriusxm  satellite radio it doesn't matter you're not on tv it's because i'm on the radio right now  song is fucking great isn't it it's catchy it is 
[03:42:00]  what do you think kenny  so bad do you play this on your hits one show not yet well it has to be hits bound i think it  might be hip bound right now but yeah that's it i'm actually so you think hits one is sleeping on  this yeah absolutely they're they're i don't know where's mikey piff they do weird stuff man i don't  understand they'll play skrillex but they won't play this which i have no problem i think it's great  skrillex is on there but it doesn't really belong on eric call mikey piff's office phone i'm doing it 
[03:42:30]  okay mikey piff's down with carly ray because he was there if i can program the song then he's a  programmer i talked to to ryan sampson i was like dude why are you not playing this ryan sampson  is just hollywood right now ryan sampson is just mr morning mashup he used to be the programmer of  hits one then he graduated but he's got more pull over there than i do they're sleeping on this man  they're sleeping on this track piff is the guy who's you know piff and kid kelly well you think  kid kelly's sleeping on this well i mean i think this belongs in there over m83 and dude i think it's 
[03:43:00]  great m83 is on hits one and skrillex is on hits one but they like that they don't but they don't belong  in there i don't think but what do i know i'm not a programmer i i disagree with that but i do  think that maybe they should be making room but what's the hook for m83 what doesn't need a hook i  mean but like a hit song needs something to catch those songs are huge right now yeah they're huge in  the alternative rock world not they're pretty big this this they're not getting 30 million hits on  youtube on a fucking yeah but they're pretty they're all over tv and every their mainstream songs 
[03:43:30]  they're very mainstream they're not alternative kegs you're on after open anthony live yeah i'm a 28 year  old dude and that song rocks my fucking world man it's fire you love it all right absolutely eric hit  it again hit it again for kegs how could you not learn kegs you love it you love this part at the  beginning that goes doot doot doot just gets you i love everything about it and ashley chisdale yeah  show in that fucking yeah dude i believe you brought him right on go ahead and look up the video if you  haven't seen it yet it's got 30 million views so you've probably seen it not the official video no the

[03:51:00]  perform the song live i'd love that you know what i mean his renditions of pop songs have become  classics on the opian anthony show i don't see why it's a bad idea um luke hey what's up uh you know  sam you know all the words to this song and why is that i mean because i listened to it seven times  while i was doing the show i pay attention to the lyrics it's not a hard song to remember hey i just  met you luke you don't know the way you don't know the words you were singing verses okay luke do you 
[03:51:30]  not know the words to the song say luke luke sing after me sing after me sing after me okay i'm gonna do  the first part then you do the second part hey i just met you uh i don't know i'm not and this is  crazy and this is crazy i don't know you know wait luke luke finish it for me but here's my number  ah you know so call me luke's quite dumb so call me luke luke so call me  baby it's maybe but you get close enough very good luke very good hey hey by the way um 
[03:52:00]  i've been listening to your sunday show you have what do you think i i like it i heard actually  this weekend it was kind of messed up was it a replay because i don't know what the  fuck happened this weekend because i took the weekend off because it was easter and they were  supposed to play joe rogan's show instead and then what happened was they played like  an hour of joe rogan then an hour of an old sam robert show then another hour of joe rogan then  another hour of an old sam robert show is that what happened that's what happened because i i i was 
[03:52:30]  listening i heard your uh you're a shilling interview and i texted you i was like hey good  interview oh yeah i got that on twitter yeah thank you uh yeah it was just it was weird  yeah and then all of a sudden at the commercial it was joe rogan and i had heard it the day before  so i'm like all right thanks buddy no problem uh chris in missouri what do you think hey uh good  morning it pains me to say this but i enjoy your show uh you probably enjoy it more today don't 
[03:53:00]  you it's a little catchier today that's a catchy song i just wanted to see what troy thought about  hits one not playing that song because it's a smaller independent label is she on an independent  label she's on bieber's um imprint label oh is it exactly i just kind of wikipedia and i just didn't  recognize yeah it's his it's his he's back and he found her yeah well if bieber's if bieber's on the  bandwagon chris if bieber's is down you got to be down too chris you are looking correct all right  later chris um it's okay to like it people yeah just like give in that's the key let yourself go 
[03:53:30]  like i remember where i was when i realized because i spent you know my time being like you know i'm a  dude i don't listen to pop music blah blah but i remember i was 18 years old and the avril levine  song complicated came on mtv the video for it and i was like oh i was like oh more pop  bullshit blah blah blah and then i was like oh okay yeah and then i just slowly realized i knew 
[03:54:00]  all the words to the song and then i was like this song is the shit and from that moment on i was like  i gotta if you're gonna be honest you gotta be honest with the fact that sometimes you like pop  music and it's okay too it's fine sam uh liam and i had bieber wings when he was here what's bieber  wings oh because you because bieber ordered wings and you had his leftovers liam and i did yeah it's  delicious any magic bieber dust on them you like this maximum in i maximum in idaho is your name  maximum it is that's a great name what do you got thank you sam i i love you and i love the show

[03:58:00]  yeah he's sitting in the car with me he's like i just need to tell you gh that i went on the after  show yeah and i told everybody that troy would beat you up and now i feel bad he said if you fought  troy there would be two sounds one would be troy hitting you and the other would be you hitting  the floor troy has a weak spot i would go for his nose would you bite i would go for his nose i would  take his nose out and he would cry like a little bitch oh troy like a little bitch i'm a lover not 
[03:58:30]  a fighter i think no ball shots though right no are you doing grunge troy wanted to grapple you though  right yeah that's that was a little weird i'm like i just i just looked at troy and he's so like  like punchable he said the same thing about me yeah in the past no he's troy's like and and i  like you try you know that i do i i have i i actually really like troy as a person but when you look at 
[03:59:00]  him sometimes you just you just wonder what it would be like to punch so he walked into the studio  during commercial break and i'm like troy let's just fight man let's just do it you want to and when  i pick fights it's not because i think i'm a tough guy and i could win that's what's fucked up about  i mean sometimes i just want to fight and this is destroyed i'm like let's fight and and everything  was cool until he goes i'm not allowed to punch him in the nose but then he brings up this grappling  thing and that's like weird man it is weird that you suggested grappling well then you're like 
[03:59:30]  punching like assholes no i can i can fight pretty good on the ground you're good ground you have any  training i i train a little bit yeah i can fight pretty good on the ground yeah but aren't you worried  about getting punched in the asshole who me yeah no i think the whole thing with grappling unless  you're an mma fighter it's really but i mean if it if it's if it's a no holds barred fight like if  there's if it's anything goes fight i'm just i'm gonna take you to the ground anyway so whoa did you  hear what he said opie yeah but what would your move be like are you gonna touch my ball i'm not gonna
