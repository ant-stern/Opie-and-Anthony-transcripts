<pre> OP and Anthony, we punish ignorance.  Hey ass, turn down your radio.  1027 WNEW.  Alright, it's FM Talk at 1027.  It's OP and Anthony and Steve Illich in the studio.  This music's too loud, sorry about that.  Yeah, I've heard from people too, like the music that's playing when we come out of a break.  Yeah.  It'll be loud in our phones, so we sound like we're yelling over the music, but it's all equalized going out of the radio. 
[00:30]
 So sometimes it sounds like, hey how you doing? It's OP and Anthony.  Well, we're back.  Oh my ears are bleeding.  Oh my god.  Alright, Rick was telling a cute little story while we were in a commercial break.  Yeah.  How long have you been married, Rick? I believe you're up to 10 days?  T plus 10 days?  I know.  10 days back from your honeymoon, a day and a half?  In an hour, it'll be 12 days total. 
[01:00]
 Alright, okay. So 12 days, a dozen days.  Dozen days.  Now Rick, you did quite well with the wedding checks, I believe.  We did okay, but it wasn't about money.  No.  Yeah, but let's face it, when you get married, you get very excited to open up those envelopes.  You do get a little giddy, don't you there, Rick?  Just a little bit.  That sack is in front of you and you're just kind of opening up envelopes going, look at this.  Like, I don't even like these people.  So you're sitting there and thinking of all the fine things you could buy with the money, right? 
[01:30]
 Yeah.  Oh yeah, correct.  You're sitting there going, wow, look at all this money. I could buy that.  Especially, you know, all the work I did the past year, the extra hours I put in.  So, like, how long did it take before you realized you'd have no say in how the money was spent?  Well, it hit me about...  Twelve days.  It hit me on the eleventh day.  Eleventh day, which was yesterday.  About 8 p.m.  Some of the money was spent yesterday. 
[02:00]
 Yeah.  How much money was spent yesterday?  I came home and I found...  Wait, wait, wait, no, just how much money did she spend yesterday?  She spent...  That's all I want to know right now. Six hundred bucks, did you say?  Six hundred dollars. Okay, now I'm thinking...  I've got some good stuff.  That's a major purchase, probably. I'm guessing either major appliance, something like that,  to make the little woman's life a little easier around the homestead, right?  All right, kids, hold on to your steering wheel really tight.  So what did she spend the money on, Rick? 
[02:30]
 Well, um...  We had registered for some things that we never got.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And, uh...  Just get to it, go.  She bought pots.  What?  Are you kidding me?  No.  She bought pots.  Now, six hundred... six hundred...  $100 worth of pots.  Pots.  And we said...  Well, I'm thinking we must get a hell of a lot of pots. 
[03:00]
 That's what I said, S-load.  For $600.  You sure she said...  She spent it on pots and not pot.  Yeah, there were no, like, you know, bags.  No, bags around the house.  All right.  This is all shit.  Rick's on the marijuana.  All right, $600 on pots, yes.  So now I'm thinking probably a pot for any occasion.  Hundreds of pots could be bought for $600. 
[03:30]
 I am dead.  How many pots were purchased for $600?  Uh...  Seven pots.  Does George Foreman come to your house too and cook for that price?  Actually, we got that.  The George Foreman lean, mean, fat-burning grilling machine.  And we got it from you and Jen.  George... Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. 
[04:00]
 All right, hold on.  Pete, what's up?  No way.  I gave you a check, you bastard.  I gave you cash.  Did you?  I know I did.  You didn't.  Get out of here.  The day I give you a goddamn grilling machine, put it over my frigging head.  We got the George Foreman fat-busting grill from you.  No.  Look, asswipe.  Look, there is no way in hell you got the George Foreman grilling fat-burning machine from us. 
[04:30]
 We did.  Dude, look, I'm pissed now.  I wrote a frigging check for you, man.  Cash.  I understand that.  I got out of the car with no wrapped gift or anything.  Right.  It was an envelope with a check in it.  You seem to have crossed up some of your labeling on gifts that were given out,  unless Opie was playing a joke on me.  Got the grilling machine and slapped our name on it. 
[05:00]
 Dude, you mean you went 12 days thinking I gave you a goddamn George Foreman?  A goddamn George Foreman grilling machine?  Linda, if you're listening, Rick's wife, if you're listening,  there's no way we got you a George Foreman grilling machine.  You're joking with me, right?  No, I'm not joking, dude.  Rick, I swear to you.  I swear to Christ to you.  And the funny part about it, dude, we were psyched. 
[05:30]
 You're like, cool.  I don't care how psyched you are.  I'm not going to get you a grilling machine, a frigging infomercial product.  I'll get our producer for his wedding.  Dude, I cut you a pretty good check.  Find it.  You can buy another half a pot with that money.  You can get at least another two or three pots.  Yeah.  I am going to frigging faint. 
[06:00]
 Are you kidding me?  You've been thinking that we got you that?  Bro, I'm going to be mocking you.  Oh my God, that guy is a frigging infomercial thing.  Where's the time master from Opie and Sandy?  Actually, we were expecting the slam, man.  Rick, I swear to you, there was no George Foreman grilling machine.  Are you sure it wasn't you?  Positive.  I just swore it was you, man.  Positive.  Holy mother of pearls.  Hey, I am blithing. 
[06:30]
 Cheryl, what's going on?  Hi.  I'm thinking that maybe Jen gave that as a bridal shower gift.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  That could have been it.  All right, well, a bridal shower gift.  That's fine.  But it still came out of you.  Had your name on it.  What?  Did not.  A bridal shower gift?  With the lingerie and the...  Nothing better for George, George, George, George and George and Rick and Linda.  And showing he cares about our producer Rick.  Come on.  Uh-oh. 
[07:00]
 Hey Pete, what's going on?  Hey, where's Rick?  Is he there?  I'm right here.  What are you, half a fag or something like that?  Everyone's a fag.  At least I'm half a fag.  What?  What do I do now?  When you take a f***, pal, what are you doing giving your wife any money at all?  I'm just busting my bums at Benz.  You're crazy.  Check your penis at the door, pal.  You don't need it anymore.  I think he's more pissed than I am.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, listen man, special for the grilling machine, man.  It's okay. 
[07:30]
 Get him up in the house, apologize and special for the grilling.  Come on, buddy.  That wasn't his wedding gift.  I was going to say that's a great gift in the black community at a wedding, right?  Absolutely, man.  I got...  No, but actually, I got married.  I could cook up my cracking neck.  I got like 50 sets of towels, man.  So like I've been married now 12 years.  I've still got towels.  I haven't even freaking used it yet.  All right, Eric, very good.  Watch the difference between guys and girls.  Let me put a lady on the phone here. 
[08:00]
 Michelle, what's going on?  Oh, I knew you were coming for me when I heard that.  What's up, Michelle?  That's reasonable.  It's a good set of pants.  $600 is a reasonable price for a seven-pot?  Think about it.  If you're going to buy a set now for $150 or whatever,  and then three years from now buy another set, three years from now buy another set.  That's the logic of the lady.  This was the logic I got last night.  Of course.  This will last 10 to 15 years.  12 years.  What kind of pots are they?  I don't know.  Are they cow porn? 
[08:30]
 They're pots.  My mother has pots in her house that I swear I remember her cooking me soupy when I was sick,  when I was a kid.  Same pots.  And they probably cost like $10.  Pots.  $600 on seven pots.  Phil, what's up?  This might not be a bad thing for Rick.  The key question is, Rick, if you came home with say a $600 stereo receiver,  would you get the s*** beat out of you?  Will you get the hell beat out of you?  Or would that be cool? 
[09:00]
 Because if it works both ways, you could work this to your advantage.  No.  I'm not going to be spending $600.  I won't get clearance on that.  Clearance.  Clearance.  It's all over for the client.  You have no chance.  If she can go and drop six, and you don't have a peep to say about it,  if you did the same thing, your host, it's, you know, just turn over everything.  Thank you, Phil.  Well, see, here's what led to the $600 pot story.  Here we go.  Okay?  We're flying back from Aruba, and she said, you know, 
[09:30]
 one of the things I wanted us to get that we didn't get for the wedding  were these sets of pots that I registered.  Planting the seed on the way home.  Look at that.  So planting a little seed.  Yeah, after a week's long of sex.  I figure, you know.  So she goes, she goes,  she goes, they're like 300, 350 bucks.  The ones she registered for.  Well, that was 10 months ago.  That set is not available anymore at William Sonoma.  So it's their fault, Rick?  So now it's the $600 set of pots. 
[10:00]
 Are you defending her by saying the store screwed up by not having?  No, this is how I got suckered in.  So then when I got home and she goes,  I got you this, and I got you this, and I got you tostitos,  and I got you little weenies, and I got you this.  Like she bought me all these like little food.  And I got $600 worth of pots.  Exactly.  Trying to run it past you.  Exactly, and it was just like, and it's like she's softening the blow.  Like, and I got the pots.  I'm like, oh cool, how much was the final total?  Well, they didn't have the ones I registered for. 
[10:30]
 And you said I could go and get them.  So, $600.  You think you know what you'd do?  I'm going to come home some day and go,  look, they didn't have the Sony Walkman I wanted,  so I had to get the big screen digital television set.  Yeah, I had to get the big screen TV.  Jay, what do you have to add?  Is Rick Vice Chance sure for Richard?  No, it's not.  I was going to say there's another nickname for Richard that sounds like Rick, 
[11:00]
 and I think you're going to start blowing yourself out for a while.  If you're trying to tell you, don't get married,  I'm trying to tell you don't get married.  Oh my God.  I was going to say what Anthony said.  Why don't you walk out and just try to buy a TV,  like a 32-inch stereo TV?  You know what would happen?  I already got one of those, and she was there for it.  Well, buy one for your room, though,  just for you like to watch football games on the weekends.  Well, that goes in your room, and then you get the big screen TV. 
[11:30]
 I'm talking the like 56-inch.  We don't have the room, dude.  Who cares?  Buy it.  It's not a matter of even watching it.  You never have to turn it on.  You just have to purchase it.  That's it.  That's it.  A doorstop.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  I'll tell you, I'm listening to you guys, and I'll tell you,  Rick's actually lucky because at least he's got something sizable  to show for $600.  My brother's witch of a wife just spent $600 on six steak knives.  Six steak knives. 
[12:00]
 $100 a knife.  One set of panko steak knives for $600.  I could appreciate a purchase like that.  I don't know what's funnier.  By the way, Rick, did you get the George Foreman grill that I sent you?  I don't know what's funnier, Rick's wife spending $600 on pots  or Anthony finding out that he gave the George Foreman grill as a wedding gift.  I did not.  You did.  It wasn't a wedding gift.  Your name was on it.  I don't know whether it was given to you as a bridal shower gift 
[12:30]
 or given to Linda as a bridal shower gift.  That was not your wedding present from us.  It was not the George Foreman fat burning grilling machine thing that he sells.  Hey, George, what's up?  I want to ask Anthony, when you ordered the George Foreman grill machine,  are you making four easy payments on that or did you get only one?  What's the matter with you now?  Four easy payments.  Did you throw in a Mark McGuire rookie card? 
[13:00]
 Me dialing people, George Foreman grill, look at the fat it burns off,  and you get a Sosa rookie card and a beanie baby.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, you guys got to play back all those days where we told Rick not to get married.  He was sounding so pompous and all full of himself.  Now he sounds like a beaten dog. 
[13:30]
 I'm not that beaten.  I still got my car.  Your little yellow sports car?  Hopefully that will be home when I get home.  Rick still has his little yellow sports car.  How long, we'll take a little pool here, how long before it's traded in for an Astro van?  How long before the Dodge Caravan is in the driveway and your little yellow sports car,  the impractical two-seater, is gonzo?  God, I hope it's home when I get home.  Andrea, hi, what's up? 
[14:00]
 Rick, how many pots did you say you got in?  I got seven pots.  Are you sure? Is it a set of seven?  I guess so, yeah.  Why?  Because if it's a set of seven, you know what you're paying for.  You're paying for three pots, maybe a pan and three lids.  Oh, they count the lids as a part of the set?  No, we definitely got seven pots out of the deal.  Are you sure about that?  Oh, well then you didn't get ripped off.  No.  And for an extra hundred, we'll throw in candles.  I'm doubting this.  It's a 20-piece set.  Well, we include the screws that hold the handles on, the washers, everything. 
[14:30]
 Pot's not included.  Rick, I want to know, I've got to come over someday and have maybe some Campbell's tomato soup cooked in an almost $100 pot.  It's got to be good.  And then it's got to taste better than just a regular old pot.  And then we can grill you up a nice grilled cheese sandwich and you George Foreman fat-busting grill, man.  It'll be a nice soup and sandwich for you.  Oh, good. 
[15:00]
 If we have to run out for any groceries, you can take me in your Dodge Caravan.  We'll pass your sports car at the lot where it was traded in for your Astro van.  You know, I feel so free.  I'm going to go out tonight and spend $600 in hookers and drives.  Just because I can.  Cutting down tonight?  We found a girl that can shoot stuff from a private area. 
[15:30]
 So, it's Adam and Adam Farrar sitting in on the program today.  Sure.  Anthony, I'm on the line.  We've got this brick guy with the crane and wildfire.  Yeah, let's hear that.  Hey, Rick.  Yep.  It's Opi and Anthony and Adam Farrar.  How are you today?  How are you guys doing?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, Rick.  We obviously got you live on the radio here in New York City.  Yes, I am.  And I hear you've got a very unusual story to tell.  Yeah, it's a little different.  All right.  Definitely a little different. 
[16:00]
 Well, I guess it goes back to 1979.  You met this girl, right?  Yeah, I met this girl.  Actually, she met me.  She had seen me, you know, around town and liked me because I was a large guy anyway.  I was 6'4", 240.  6'4", 240 back in 1979.  Big guy.  Just out of high school, four years of football, all that good stuff.  All right.  And 20 years later, how much do you weigh?  Right now, I'm 5'37".  I topped out in 1989 at about 8'50". 
[16:30]
 Sell!  Sell!  Sell!  Yeah, get rid of it all.  And obviously, this girl has something to do with your drastic weight gain.  Yeah, she did, very much so.  She had a fetish of what I'm finding out seems to be what is called these feeder people  or whatever.  And she sexually got stimulated whenever she would watch me eat food.  Wow.  Yeah, it was to the point of where I could sit down, eat a piece of cake after dinner 
[17:00]
 or something like that.  And she would just be all excited and I would just have to finish the job.  Was she a big girl?  She was a whopping 98 pounds.  Wow.  So she's a rail.  Soaking wet.  Wow.  You guys made the number 10 when you stood next to each other.  Yeah, just about.  Well, yeah, later on.  All right.  So did you know she had this fetish when you met her?  No, I had no idea.  No clue?  So what was your first clue?  How long did it take?  Right.  Well, my first clue of it really getting to the point of, oh my God, what the hell am I 
[17:30]
 going to do with this, was I had gotten in a little trouble with some marijuana before  I had met her.  Sure.  And then I was like, oh, I'm going to go to the grocery store and get some weed.  That's how it starts.  That's what makes you hungry.  Grass, weed.  That was part of it.  But hey, it was California in the 70s.  Mary Jane.  Before you know it, you're doing Benny's, Dexys.  I bet you think you're pretty cool and far out, don't you?  The next step is Entenmann's cake, then you're moving the bed into the kitchen.  And then we just started sleeping in a grocery store. 
[18:00]
 All right.  So tell us the first clue.  Go ahead.  You got in trouble for drugs, right?  I got sentenced to a couple of months in jail, LA County jail.  And I found out that she had gone to the judge, I believe the one that sentenced me, and told  him that her mental state welfare and all that good stuff was dependent upon the fact  that I stayed large.  I was up to about 350, maybe 400 at this time.  And she was afraid of going in there eating that sort of food. 
[18:30]
 I was going to lose a lot of weight.  This judge gave a court order to her that ordered me to receive double portions of food  inside the jail.  Come on.  That's the Oprah bill.  Nice word.  It's documented court documents to prove it all.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  So you're in jail for a while.  Yes.  And you're still packing on pounds.  No, because I just refused to do it.  I'm not stupid.  The food was crap, so you're not going to eat double portions of crap.  So now how was she?  Were there any other inmates that liked to watch you eat?  Bubba.  Yeah, his name was no.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure. 
[19:00]
 I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  No.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  So how did she get turned on if you're in jail?  Oh, she didn't.  Actually, there were a couple of incidences where she would come to the visiting room.  She had arranged for a private visit, which was still through the glass.  And I would sit there and I had eaten, I had saved a couple candy bars that I had bought  at the store. 
[19:30]
 I sat there and ate them on one side of the glass and she was going, oh, overcoat, do  under thing.  Let me ask you something.  Were the guards like that scene in Goodfellas?  Come right this way.  Come on in.  Don't wait.  Sign right in here.  Come this way, Mrs. Hill.  The girl with the coat.  Come on.  Come this way.  Wow.  You must have been the king after that.  This only happened one time.  Oh.  That only happened once in jail?  Yeah, that did only happen once.  All right.  So after you got out of jail, what happened when you guys were living together and stuff?  Well, you know, it seemed like she got more of a fever pitch for this whole thing. 
[20:00]
 It was like she doubled her efforts to make me large.  And I was caught in the trap of where I was doing what I wanted, eating good food and  having great sex.  Well, how turned on would she get as she watched you eat?  All I could tell you is you just had to watch it.  I mean, you just had to see it.  It was to wear moisture, you know?  I mean, I don't know what other way to put it.  So she was like, yeah, really turned on.  Oh, yes.  And what was she like, a dynamo?  Like really? 
[20:30]
 Yeah, she was a little 98 pound person.  You spin her like a helicopter, you know, spin her like a top.  Would she scream out foods in the middle of her orgasm?  You know, it never got to the nine and a half weeks kind of thing.  Right.  I kind of wish it did once in a while.  But no, it did never go that way.  It was never that kind of food thing.  Did you play like airplanes coming in for a landing?  Did you do stuff like that?  No, because I would have been the spruce goose and I would have probably crashed.  Howard Hughes reference.  Whoa, how good are you? 
[21:00]
 Take a couple of donuts at a petty cash.  No, I'm over those.  So when did you decide that you had enough?  Well, it was 1989.  I had maxed out at about 850.  Second stopped about 300 pounds ago.  Oh, really?  She just gave up on you?  That's just, well, no, it just goes away.  You're not able to.  Well, yeah, she couldn't find it.  Yeah, it doesn't function anymore.  Really?  It functions in one capacity and that's to urinate.  That's it.  Oh, you couldn't sport no chubs? 
[21:30]
 Well, you can, but not to where it was any use.  You know, it was just it was too well covered up.  Oh, dead sexy.  Did you lay there?  Look at my sexy body.  So you wouldn't be saying that looking in my mirror.  No.  So the sex ended and you decided to get rid of this one, huh?  Well, she was cheating on me with a neighbor upstairs,  a normal sized guy.  So at that point.  Well, that's how it started out.  Yeah, that was it. 
[22:00]
 Goodbye.  Yeah, well, that's how it starts.  Sure.  Like a Stephen King character or something.  It just goes around, yeah.  Making guys big fat pats and then, wow.  Well, you know what, dude, I'll tell you something.  She did this to a guy after me.  There was another guy.  I ran across her like three, four years later.  I had gotten down to about 600 pounds.  I was getting around and I came across her again.  And there she was.  She had met a guy.  He was about 200 when he met her at that time. 
[22:30]
 And he was probably at about six.  Oh, man.  Is that something?  Is it?  This chick had a fetish and she didn't  mind going for what she wanted.  Is it also true that she got abusive when you decided  you didn't want to eat as much?  Oh, yeah.  If there was any time that I didn't completely  finish the half a pack of hot dogs that she'd make with buns  and a big bag of Lay's chips and a half a gallon ice cream,  one time in particular I left two hot dog buns, 
[23:00]
 the very ends, sitting on the plate.  She came home from whatever she was out doing,  probably shopping for more.  And she saw these two hot dog buns on the end of the plate.  She goes, what's that?  And I go, well, I was done.  I had three pounds of other food.  I don't need those.  And she just walked past me, behind me a little bit,  grabbed this cane out of the closet or whatever.  And next thing I knew, I was getting whacked 
[23:30]
 over the back of the head with it.  Wow.  Yeah.  What a cook.  At that point, I was about 800 pounds.  And for people listening, you don't.  I mean, sure, I could have grabbed her, broke her  like a twig.  Then I'm in prison for life.  Right.  What good does that do me?  OK.  At 850, you don't just get out and hail a taxi.  Right.  OK.  Wow.  That's what I was doing.  This is a Stephen King novel.  Eat it!  Eat it!  Look at that.  Hey, if you have his number, have him get a hold of me.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[24:00]
 I've never heard of that before.  That's not good.  Where is she now?  She's?  She lives in California out here somewhere.  I have no idea.  She's out there with a short skirt and a bundt cake.  Yeah.  How does this end up ending?  Well, my story hasn't ended yet.  We just split up.  It was to the point where, hey, look, we're just done.  She was in agreement, and we just split up.  I got on my own.  I started eating naturally. 
[24:30]
 I wasn't naturally a 12 hot dog for lunch guy.  OK?  I just started eating normally, and I dropped down  to what I am now.  I've actually been lower, less than what I am now,  but I'm not because of the yo-yo diet thing.  I'm at a point.  Did people you knew just say, hey, dude, what's  happening to you?  You're blowing up.  Oh, my god.  I had friends, my parents, my mother,  but the whole thing was so controlled by her  that, understand this, any time she left the house, 
[25:00]
 all the phones were gone.  I had no way of communicating.  Oh, my god.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  It's the flip side of abuse.  Instead of the man abusing the woman,  it was the woman abusing a man in a very bizarre way.  I understand.  Wow, man.  There's a couple notes that our producer wrote down.  There's a car story.  A car story.  Air conditioning, went nuts.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[25:30]
 She made you eat a Buick?  Yeah, she was like, no, no, I never did that.  She would get so upset.  I was telling your producer about one time  where, wherever we went anywhere,  like I remember one hot summer day,  I had to go to the doctor's office.  I was in the car, and it was sweat.  Any time that I sweated, it was, she  would make every effort to keep me as cool as possible.  Yeah, you'd lose weight if you sweat.  Exactly.  You sweat.  That was her whole theory.  You'd lose weight.  Oh, I always had whatever to drain the air conditioner 
[26:00]
 on full.  Any time she would get out, go in the store,  the engine, she'd leave it running,  so the air conditioner would be off.  Well, one time the engine was overheating,  and I had to turn it off.  And she was still in there about another 15 minutes.  I rolled down the windows, and I'm sweating.  She comes out just freaking.  I mean, dude, she's all over the place.  Run her on the car.  What are you doing?  She actually picked up a magazine  and started fanning me.  What are you doing?  What are you, nuts? 
[26:30]
 This is like misery.  If it starts, we can go home.  If it don't start, I'm going to sweat another 10 pounds off.  Why do you drink your sweat?  Why do you put up with this?  Drink your sweat.  Rick, why did you put up with this?  Well, you know, it was a-  I did it all for the new kid.  Going off the new kid so you could take that donut  and stick it up your ass.  Yeah, well, it wasn't that bad.  It wasn't that bad.  Come on.  Wow.  It was a matter of where I was brought up.  Oh, yeah, it wasn't that bad.  Yeah, I mean, the poor guy was a turtle on his back. 
[27:00]
 What's he going to do?  He's 800 pounds.  He's beating him with a cane.  Yeah.  Anything else you could add to this, Rick?  I'm on my way to the road to recovery.  Right now, I'm down to 537.  And I'm getting ready to have the phobia pouch surgery,  which is the same one that Rosanne Barr had done.  Sure.  And it's just a fantastic thing.  I never wanted to mutilate my body to take care of my problem,  but I've gotten to the point where I'm 41 years old. 
[27:30]
 And that's it.  I've got to do something.  Are you in any relationship now or anything?  No, no relationships out there.  You know, in California, this is where all the pretty people live.  And if you don't fit into that category, you know, forget about it.  Sal, what's up?  It sounds like maybe his wife grew up in the Midwest,  and her father raised veal.  What's the name of this fetish she had, Rick?  I believe it was, I mean, I've gotten,  I never knew there was one. 
[28:00]
 But I've had people contact me saying that's the Feeders?  Feeders.  Feeders.  That's the name of the book.  Stephen King's latest novel, Feeders.  Based on the novel Eat, Beat, and Bang.  Oh, man.  Very nice.  Is she really hot?  She looks a lot like Marlo Thomas of that girl.  Oh, really?  She was, when I met her, that's what she looked like, very much so. 
[28:30]
 Big brown eyes.  She was a model.  That's cool.  Cool story.  Well, that's the one ugly.  That's the best story of the day, I'll tell you right now, Rick.  You know, unfortunately, it happened to me.  But hey.  Can we send you some food or anything?  No thanks.  All right.  No thanks.  I don't think you need that.  I just do have a website that people can go check out and see,  read more details, see pictures of me, stuff like that.  Any pictures of her on there?  No, no pictures of her.  You ought to pop one up.  I don't want to get in trouble.  You won't get in trouble.  What's she going to do, get your fat and beat you?  I'm sure he did that. 
[29:00]
 Email us a picture of her.  Double Jeopardy.  Yes, send us a picture.  Yeah, I want to see what this is.  Give a picture.  Oh yeah, that'll be great.  I'll see what this is.  Check it out.  Yeah, we got it.  It'll be posted all over New York in about two hours.  Oh no, we don't even have access to a website.  Yeah, we don't have websites or anything.  Actually, my story will be out in the National Enquirer, probably,  and within about two weeks.  Really?  That will have a picture of her.  Because back in 88, she entered us in a contest  where the Enquirer has these weird contests. 
[29:30]
 It was the largest weight differential.  Oh really?  Yeah, we blew them away, one of them easily $500 or something,  and they came out, took a bunch of pictures.  I'll see that picture.  I've had pictures of him and her, of me and her before.  Well then, I guess we'll see her picture there.  Yeah, you will see her, definitely.  All right, Rick, give out your website address here.  It's www.IntotheWeb.com.  www.IntotheWeb.com  Yeah, just all kinds of stuff, message boards.  You guys can just go check it out and see pictures 
[30:00]
 of what I look like at 850.  All right, it better not be a paid site,  because we get pissed off at that.  Dude, it's all free.  All right, very calm.  I don't believe in that.  If it was a paid site, we'd come over there  and beat you with a cane or something.  Just shove a ham sandwich up your ass and beat you up.  Are you the comedian on the show?  Oh no.  There's no comedian here.  Very serious.  All right, Rick, thank you.  Good luck.  You guys have a good one, man.  All right, bye.  Take care.  There he goes, Rick, in his unusual fetish.  Wow.  Opie, you're a sick ass man. 
[30:30]
 Anthony, you're not a jackass.  You're obviously a stud.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sick.  1027 WNEW.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show.  More on the God of Ferraris just a bit here.  And whatever you have for the show,  give us a call, 212-757-1027.  Black Crows, hard to handle.  WNEW.  I can't even believe these ones.  He's a disgusting little man.  What a douchebag.  Trainwreck Radio.  Vancouver.  Ah! 
[31:00]
 This is sicker than faces of death.  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  This is debauchery mania.  Prostate exam for everyone.  111027 WNEW.  Ah, yes.  And in the studio this afternoon,  Adam Ferraro, everyone.  Yeah, Adam's here man.  Out of nowhere he decides to stop by  and say hi to his pals.  Yeah, I bet Hillary doesn't get bumped from Letterman. 
[31:30]
 Okay.  Adam came in.  I bet you my girlfriend doesn't get oral favors  from my page.  So yeah, Adam was supposed to do Letterman  last time he was on the show.  What, last week?  Yeah.  You know what I like, every time I come in here,  it's, hi, we're gonna break your balls for a little bit.  The first that you dated my sister,  then it's the Olive Garden commercial,  then I think you nailed me on the love boat episode I did.  I missed that damn thing.  You better have a tape of that. 
[32:00]
 I wanna play all the tapes of that.  Are you kidding me?  I gotta see that.  You were on the, Adam was on an episode of the new love.  The new love.  Oh, don't start.  You want me to sing some of the early songs you wrote?  Thank you, no.  Okay.  But we got a lot of crap on here.  Oh, Tara.  I didn't write that, that was Joe Buck's song.  My brother wrote that one.  That one sucked.  Wait, how's that?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, there's too much going on here.  What?  What was the song?  It was for two people, me and Anthony.  Yeah, right?  Not really, he sung a song called Dara. 
[32:30]
 But Joe wrote it.  Now there's a lot, the early collections of As Is,  spelled A-Z-I-Z, which is the name of like 90%  of the cab drivers.  All right.  Yeah.  That was the name of one of your bands then?  You think I named it?  Okay.  I showed up drunk to sing.  That was the extent of it.  Now you're Jim Morrison.  I didn't move equipment.  I didn't write the song.  Now you're Jim Morrison.  Before, when you were going.  My voice, he's walking around with an ascot and an atmo.  Yeah, right. 
[33:00]
 Don't come back.  I must keep everybody away.  Why?  Because we're doing, what was that song you used to do?  That boss gas?  Lido, and I can't hit the lido.  That's it.  It's the lido shuffle.  The lido shuffle.  Get out of here.  I miss the boat, it's breaking up.  I need more mist in my throat.  Can we transpose this to my key?  I've seen it work it, man.  After a gig, it's hilarious.  Jesus.  The rest of his band is like shuffling the equipment  back to the van and there's André 
[33:30]
 and his Budweiser at the bar going,  hey man, tell me more about my ice.  Come on.  What do you expect?  And that was a while ago.  That was fun though.  I like them because I used to run the lights  and Anthony like would build,  he's a mad scientist for God's sake.  You leave something in his house,  and he MacGyvers it into a helicopter.  It was toothpicks in a rubber band, not anymore.  It's a spruce goose too.  So he used to hook up the light board  with like, you had like these big rubber Lilco gloves  because you had the 220 off the pole. 
[34:00]
 Yeah.  You had to actually open up the circuit breaker box  in the club and clamp on these big,  looked like jumper cables.  They were jumper cables.  Oh.  Onto the 220 bolts, onto the 2110 legs  coming out of the box.  And so, and they're live.  And you can't shut it off because the club is running.  So you'd have to sit there with big rubber gloves on it.  Psh, psh, psh.  Oh.  And it was like ghost buzzers, don't cross the stream.  Because he gave those things touch,  he could electrocute himself.  Oh wow.  So he would take the 220 lines  and he would channel it through all this stuff 
[34:30]
 into an old Atari board.  Remember Atari board with the four switches?  And that's what we had four channels of lights.  And that's how we would move the lights.  That was when the original light board broke, my friend,  and I had to rig it.  Oh, the one you built.  That shop light.  The one I stole.  Yeah.  Some stupid lighting company in Jersey rented us lights.  We never brought them back.  You know what I like?  Terrorists try to get their deposit back on the van.  He doesn't bring back a light.  I don't remember that.  Wow.  Too funny.  Well, that was many, many years ago. 
[35:00]
 Many, many years ago.  And of course, we do dredge up these things  and things that you did in the past.  Because I don't know why.  It's not interesting at all.  It's not.  It's using the us.  But we were saying you got bumps from Letterman.  That's where it started.  And it was last week.  And there's a lot of people on the phone  that feel bad for you.  Thank you.  Kathleen?  Yeah, I want to know, how many times  have you been bumped from Letterman?  What's the process like?  And does it really piss you off?  This is my first time being bumped.  It hurts, and I'm getting over the pain.  Thank you, Kathleen. 
[35:30]
 Thank you.  Adam walked through our studio door today.  I said, hey, if you were on Letterman last week,  I don't think we would have saw your face for a while.  Yeah.  I know.  Peter Van Elsthal.  I told you I was coming back here today  to plug my governor's day.  Peter Van Elsthal.  I'm a whore.  That's why.  I'm going to see you tomorrow night.  Cool.  Definitely.  Come down.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night at Tugger.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  And Sunday.  Come down after services.  They set up the Ferrara cot in the back, I guess.  There you go.  Keeping you there the whole weekend.  Sure.  Out of Gordville.  You better call ahead.  I'm following the seal. 
[36:00]
 Adam does very well.  Look at you.  You sound like my mother's friend.  He's in show business doing very well.  He's doing very well.  I understand he has gentle through the union.  How's mom and Big Joe?  Mom and my father?  Yeah.  I told you they came into Letterman.  They said it was a big night.  She wore the fur.  Yeah.  I feel so bad.  His parents go to Letterman.  They're sitting right there up front to see their son on national TV, David Letterman.  Dad took a nap in the afternoon, so he'd be all right.  So he could stay awake. 
[36:30]
 Sure.  And what happens?  He gets bonked.  And your parents have to get up and leave without seeing you.  Kids hit the big stage there.  No, my father's like, hey, it happens.  That's life.  You want Chinese?  That was it.  That was it, huh?  That was it.  You got some steamed dumplings on your move on.  Adam, I remember a time I went to see at Governor's.  And I'm thinking Anthony's friend, big Hollywood star.  You were doing the sitcoms and the guest appearances and stuff.  I brought Sandy, right?  We're walking across the parking lot.  There you are before your big night at Governor's changing a tire.  I'm changing a flat tire. 
[37:00]
 Oh, yeah.  And you know what's funny?  My travel plans now is my father's plumbing truck,  because mom's got to take the caddy to Marjane.  I'm not actually changing a tire.  I'm getting into my next role.  I'm Caroline in the city, where I have to change a tire.  I'm researching it.  We all consider ourselves to be in show business.  And we look up to you, Adam.  And I'm like, wow, you really should raise your college.  I'm like, look at Adam changing a tire.  I'm like, where's his people?  They're all my people.  You're the only pal I have that's in show business, like that. 
[37:30]
 What are you, in real estate?  What the hell do you think you're doing?  I'm not my own pal.  What?  I'm not my own pal.  I've heard you talk to yourself many times.  Usually after a gig, who does Joe Buck think he is?  I'm the leader of this band.  Yeah.  As is, behind the music.  That happened.  As is.  A-Z-I-Z.  A-Z-I-Z.  That was so low going stuff on the drum kit.  That was so long ago.  It was ridiculously long ago.  But you've got to share a little bit. 
[38:00]
 To the point where, no, it wasn't even the first,  what was the first name again?  I couldn't even remember.  Did you guys have the hair going stuff?  Like the silver platters.  It was ridiculous.  It was, you get 80s, so you wanted to try to run.  In a makeshift model.  Yeah, we were doing Brady Bunch cover tunes,  is what we were doing, Adam.  You're absolutely right.  It's a sunshine day when it's time to change.  Yeah, that's exactly what we were doing.  Although we did do some spinal tap covers.  You remember this.  That was fun.  That's classic.  Chris, what's up?  What's going on?  How you doing? 
[38:30]
 How you doing?  Hey, hey, I'm Adam, man.  Yes.  I feel really bad for you because you got bumped  by that space tooth moron.  Thank you, Chris.  Space tooth moron.  You know what I'm saying?  Thank you, Chris.  All right, man.  You are the best, yo, Adam.  Thank you.  And me.  Peace.  And whoopee.  Peace.  All right.  You think, yeah, tonight, you think  Dave's going to have the 45 minutes of crap, stupid bits  where he takes a camera to the film store next door  from the studio, while Hillary waits in the green room  wondering if she's going to be on? 
[39:00]
 I don't think so.  And who's more entertaining, Hillary or Adam Ferrara?  Adam Ferrara.  Adam Ferrara.  Absolutely.  Never saw Hillary say, hospitaliano.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  I think there's got to be a by the way in there somewhere,  Alice.  All right.  What's by the way?  Ah ha!  Anna.  Yeah, hi.  How are you?  How are you, boy, still?  One time, I seen Adam at a governor's. 
[39:30]
 Oh, really?  Yeah, he's pretty hot.  Yes, he is, isn't he?  I want to grab onto his buns.  Adam, she wants to grab your buns.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say, so you know.  Not sure what you're supposed to say?  I don't know.  Hey, whose sister are you?  His sister?  Hey, I got seven of them.  Which one do you want?  Adam has something for all the sisters on this radio show.  Seven sisters?  Wow.  So you met him backstage?  Well, he was kind of back there, and I was walking past him. 
[40:00]
 And I walked up to him, and I asked him what's pink,  and he smells like pussy cats.  And he's like, what?  And I stuck my tongue out at him.  And then I told him, I'm like, what?  Anna, oh, I remember you.  You remember that?  Interesting.  You can't remember that.  Can I still remember that?  Anna, that doesn't happen every day.  And then I was telling you about, I guess,  I could say, Tuesday at Hummer Club, I do that.  And I let my friend watch as I'm doing it, too.  You know, my old man.  Boy, it sure sounded like you could have gotten lucky here.  That's when you fell on your butt. 
[40:30]
 You're like, oh, my god.  So if Adam would have been up to it,  would you have given him a Hummer that night?  It wasn't until it was Thursday.  My old man was home, sure.  It was the wrong day of the week.  Oh, my god.  It doesn't matter.  It could be any day of the week.  I'm always up for that.  You should see Adam when he gets done with his show.  He comes out to the bar in the front by Governor Sincero.  I'm not going to go.  And the chicks are just like, taking him in style.  I know he's got to be nice.  Isn't he married?  What's the matter?  He's got a girlfriend.  No, he's got a girlfriend.  Oh, he's better. 
[41:00]
 He's in a very serious relationship.  How is she?  She's very nice.  Yeah?  Very good.  You should tell your nice one.  Can I meet her?  Can I meet her?  Oh, oh, meet.  Yeah, can I meet her?  Oh, you said something else.  I'll take both of yous on, honey.  Whoa.  Wow.  Wow.  So you're going to go to Governor's?  I don't know.  When's the next time you're going?  He's there Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you come to my house instead, baby?  Wow.  Do you remember what she looked like and all?  No. 
[41:30]
 No.  I just saw her.  What do you look like there, Anna?  Let's see.  Well, I'm a dancer.  Really?  Yeah.  Where?  Why?  Flash dancers?  Stonehenge.  Stonehenge?  Out on Long Island?  Yeah, with them.  Oh, I remember that place.  That place rocks.  I love that place.  I had the best time.  So you're a dancer there, huh?  Finding romp-o-mints.  Oh, boy.  No, wait.  Do you dance during the week, or are you dancing on weekends?  During the day.  I don't like going at night.  Uh-oh, day dancing.  You're a matinee.  Day dancing at Stonehenge. 
[42:00]
 That's scary.  You know why they usually put the camera  on the girls that aren't that hot on in the day?  Because I'm just saying, because when you walk in there from all the bright light into the  dark club, it takes you half hour before you can see anything.  Yeah, I know.  And then by that time, you had a couple of $10 beers.  I don't like going at night, because I've got five things to do at night.  And it looks like you're in the double-A ball.  Yeah, yeah.  What's a double-A ball?  You've got to be brought up to the majors.  It's like open pole, Mike.  Yeah.  Wow, Stonehenge.  You look hot and stuff. 
[42:30]
 I'm cool, man.  You're not all bruised up and everything.  There's nothing better than looking at a dancer.  It looks like she's gone a couple of rounds with Tyson.  Hey, that's a scenario scar.  She's all beat up.  An old cigarette burns.  No, I don't like that.  You're not skanked up there.  I'm like a drunkard.  You're like a drunkard.  I'm going to try to make a green wine.  You're like a drunkard.  There's a lot going on.  I'm good.  You're like a drunkard.  You're like a drunkard.  You're like a drunkard.  You're like a drunkard.  You're like a drunkard.  You're like a drunkard.  You have a D cup.  Yeah. 
[43:00]
 Wow.  There was five people talking at one time.  I heard that.  But she said she has a D cup.  What's the other one?  That's in the middle of her head.  No, it's in the back of my head.  I'm deaf, you know, with the bells.  Well, you ought to go down to a governor's and see that.  Please welcome to the main stage Medusa.  He'll know who you are now.  Oh, yeah?  I'm telling you that stripper from Stonehenge.  What color are you?  It's red.  Oh, you're redhead.  Yeah.  Natural?  Well, I got no hair on my neck. 
[43:30]
 You know, I like a girl that edits herself.  There you go.  Did you shave it or did it fall out?  You know, ever since Shorum reactivated...  Was it rubbed off?  With your face, honey.  There you go.  She's not messing around.  No, definitely not.  She's hurt at all.  Any piercings that we should know about?  I'm not a freak.  No.  Any tats-hats?  I don't take that crap.  No tattoos?  No tattoos.  No tattoos.  All right.  Well, she's a... 
[44:00]
 I'm a good girl.  You sound like a church girl.  Yeah.  All right, baby.  Come down and say hello.  I use the term loosely.  All right, Adam.  We'll see Adam this weekend at governor's, okay?  All righty.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  I'm proud to see you, honey.  Okay.  All right.  Are you going to have a ticket waiting for me?  We'll see what we can do.  If you wear a skirt, no underwear,  put your legs up on the stage while he's performing,  yeah, you can work it out.  All right, then I'll show you if I'm going to...  There'll be some work in the crowd that night. 
[44:30]
 Whoa-ho!  Slide down.  Look at that.  I didn't know governors had drink cozies.  Drink cozies.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  All right, Adam.  We got to fly.  Oh, go.  Bye.  Bye.  During the day dance.  Yeah, the day dance.  Maybe we give them dollars.  The guys give them mints and...  Well, you know what the...  The clients are going to be like,  It's all because I remember they're doing this.  It's all construction workers that don't want to friggin' work.  Right.  So they go in there during the day, you figure,  we'll leave the job, we'll have an early lunch,  and we'll get back to work right after lunch.  We'll be back to work by one.  You go there at noon, it opens up.  By four o'clock, you're going, 
[45:00]
 geez, screw it, we'll leave the tools out.  We got to be there tomorrow anyway.  You never go back.  You never go back.  I mean, that's what it's like to be a part of something  that's been going on for a long time.  And I think it's the most important thing  that we can do now.  Yeah.  I think it's the most important thing.  I think it's the most important thing.  I think it's the most important thing.  I think it's the most important thing.  I think it's the most important thing.

I think it's the most important thing. 
[49:00]
 I think it's the most important thing.  We were getting pretty nasty drunk.  We were graduating and a buddy of mine brought in a bottle of peach snops.  What he did was he took the cork out of it, put it on the stage and said, I'll give you  five bucks if you pick this up without your hands.  Yeah, that move.  So they got a little upset with this.  That was strike one.  So a couple of minutes later, you know they have the low on the action.  There's like a waiting for the second team to come up on the stage.  We're really drunk and one of my drunkest buddies stands up and screams, and I'll clean 
[49:30]
 up the stuff.  Screams, bring on the sea.  Bring on the sea.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Last time I heard that was on Broadway when they wanted to bring.  That was in the Will Rogers folly.  But the guy who spilled it out went to Rome.  He was bringing Stella Stevens on stage.  Bring on the sea.  Oh my God.  That same night he goes home in the car like, why don't the chicks dig me?  What do I got to do?  So what'd they do to the guy?  Where's the water?  They'd go, I'm going to go get some water.  They'd go, I'm going to go get some water.  They'd go, I'm going to go get some water.  They'd go, I'm going to go get some water.  They'd go, I'm going to go get some water.  It was like out of a Western, you know, when the star of the movie gets called out in the 
[50:00]
 street for a gunfight, it was like quiet.  And all of a sudden the DJ gets on the mic and goes, we have nice girls here.  How dare you talk about them like that?  And then they kick this out in the street.  Oh yeah.  You're lucky they kicked you out.  Yeah, a lot of the bars, you know, the biker guys that run the place.  It's out in the crowd.  Yeah, your favorite.  It's called the back room.  Very funny, Frank.  All right, you guys.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  I knew a girl, you know, the ping pong ball trick, right? 
[50:30]
 Yeah, sure.  She had like laser sighting.  Really?  She was like, like, she's the kind of girl you want to take to the carnival to win the  fish.  Give me two fish, I don't use my hand.  Every time.  But in like, in like those tall glasses, you know, she's like, I'm going to go get some  water.  I'm going to go get some water.  I'm going to go get some water.  I'm going to go get some water.  I'm going to go get some water.  I'm going to go get some water.  I'm going to go get some water.  I'm going to go get some water.  I'm going to go get some water.

I'm going to go get some water.  I'm going to go get some water.  I'm going to go get some water.  I'm going to go get some water.  He had to clean his glass.  Really?  It was that much of a show going on on stage.  He thought he had cataract.  I saw a stripper with one foot.  She had like a foot, a normal foot, and then another foot had like little chicklet toes. 
[52:00]
 Club foot kind of thing?  That's what you need, a thalidomide stripper.  Wait, she had her breasts done.  You think you'd take care of all the other stuff first.  The general rule of construction is you don't put a second floor in a house with a bed found.  And all the construction guys got to know that.  That's it, man.  You were a tin knocker, right?  Hell yeah.  That's it, man.  That's who we were drinking with, with the tin knockers. 
[52:30]
 Everybody decided to take a nooner, but since I'm the low man on the totem pole, we left  the bar and everybody patted me on the back and said, go put the tools away.  Yeah, go put the tools away.  Yeah, we had this girl in there.  She was about 50 years old and she had a pretty all right body, but nobody really paid attention  to the face.  But they called her the ice queen because she would put ice all over her body and then  put it in her mouth and spit it at you.  But what they forgot to tell you was she spit it between her Leon Spinks space in her teeth.  That's wonderful.  Yeah, I love how the strippers are doing things they think is hot and you think is disgusting. 
[53:00]
 And you got to sit there, you're like, oh, I'm paying 10 bucks a girl to spit at me.  Can't you force it home?  She had like G string depends on everybody says they should have been a dancer.  They said it in 1942.  Wow.  You don't know how many hammer drills and sawsalls were lost because we just never went back  to the job site.  We lock up the tools and no one's going to steal them.  What happened to the hammer drill?  I don't know, boss.  We were there the whole time.  I think the plumbers took it. 
[53:30]
 They're not.  We're not.  That's the steam fitters.  Hey, Joe, thank you.  Hey guys, I got a train.  Have a good day.  I had a lot of great stories on hold.  Anthony, a lot.  Yeah.  If you're on hold, stay there.  We got to take another quick break because we've been running late the whole show today.  All right.  Running off the mouth.  We'll be back very shortly.  Stay there.  Oh, be an Anthony.  Yeah.  Make it easy.  Literacy off the air, please.  I wasn't on it.  I wouldn't listen.  One oh two seven.  W. N. E. W. Hey, Anthony.  Hey, stacker to the world's strongest fat burner. 
[54:00]
 That's right.  Yeah.  You can't be a stripper when you're fat.  Right.  That's right.  So if you're a stripper, maybe you put on a few extra pounds during the holidays.  Just packing in the turkey and ham and everything.  You got to lose that weight quick.  You're not going to make any tips.  I said tips.  Stacker to the world's strongest fat burner.  Uh-huh.  It does three things.  Yes.  Well, it's the world's strongest fat burner.  Yeah.  And it gives you a boost of energy if you're feeling sluggish during the last dance of  your shift up on stage.  Sure.  Reject this song.  Yeah.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go. 
[54:30]
 I'm going to go.  Reject this song, please.  Reject this.  It's too fast.  I can't keep up.  I need more energy.  Does the fat burner provide that?  And it, uh, what else does it do?  Oh, it cuts down on your cravings to snack during the day so you could fit more of those  champagne cocktails in you.  Or during, yeah, or during the dances.  Yeah.  You know, in between dances, you don't want to be snacking.  You lose weight because a big fat ass doesn't get the dollars stuck in the G-string.  There you go, Anthony.  Sure, the stacker people will agree with that.  Of course they will.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go. 
[55:00]
 The world's strongest fat burner.  Thousands have proven it works.  We're back with the Opiate Anthony Show. 
[55:30]
 Hey.  Hanging out with us today, Adam Farrar.  Went to grab a cup of coffee.  That's right.  Sure, there he is.  Sure.  He'll be at Governor's all weekend long starting tomorrow, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Call ahead for tickets.  I'm definitely going to the Thursday Show.  Going tomorrow, man.  Got to see my pal on his opening night there at Governor's.  My chance.  The millionth opening night at Governor's.  Yeah, I know.  We do it all the time.  We're all keeping our fingers crossed, hoping that Letterman's people will call Adam.  We must get rescheduled.  Yeah, Adam's looking to get rescheduled on Letterman. 
[56:00]
 They're much too busy to think about it today, Anthony.  They got Hillary on the show tonight.  I think Psycho Mark's heading down to the Letterman studio to mess with people.  Oh, that's good.  There's nothing like secret service people down there or anybody that'll just wrestle  into the ground and split his head open in front of the David Letterman Theater over  there.  You know, those deaf people have attitudes.  What do you mean deaf people?  The ones with the little earphones?  They don't like that.  It's just a zoo down there right now.  I went for the Travis Bickle head. 
[56:30]
 Paddle work.  Did she come in yesterday?  I think so.  I saw the helicopters yesterday.  Oh yeah?  Yeah, I was down in Wall Street area and I saw the helicopter and I go, who's coming  into town?  Hillary.  Must be Opie and Anthony.  Oh yeah, that's it.  Yeah, by helicopter.  Sure.  I was on the Long Island Railroad this morning with a big fat guy sleeping on my shoulder.  Are you kidding me?  Did we pass miniola?  Hillary's still using our tax dollars to travel to New York too, by the way. 
[57:00]
 Just wanted to remind you that.  She didn't announce that she's actually a candidate for Senate.  So you know, she's been saving up money and getting donations when she announces that she's  going to be a candidate.  Then she has to use that money.  But now it's just, oh, now she's just taking a trip to New York.  Bill, can I borrow the car?  Exactly.  Can I borrow the chopper and the Marines that fly it and the landing strip and the reroute  and air traffic just because she got fat asses in the air?  Oh Christ.  Woman makes me sick. 
[57:30]
 It's going to be a joke on Letterman tonight too.  She's not going to answer anything tonight.  What do you think?  I know.  It's just going to be stupid boring TV.  Just what?  You know, they probably came up with some wacky bit.  You know how Dave's been asking her to be on the show and asking and saying that they've  been declining and declining.  Now she's finally doing it.  So expect some kind of a bit made out of that.  And then it's just going to be her preaching and doing some Rudy bashing.  She doesn't have an agenda like she's going to announce she's coming.  She doesn't have an agenda.  It depends on what the polls say. 
[58:00]
 Her popularity has gone down.  It's below 50% for the first time.  And Rudy's is, well his has remained the same.  Well his has dropped too, but he's in the lead.  He's still in the lead.  But you know, if Letterman and his people had balls, I would like to have Rudy come on tonight.  Oh yeah.  Don't even tell anyone.  In the middle of the interview.  Yeah, he just comes in and punches her right in the face.  God, I'd laugh my ass off.  It should reenact the Andy Kaufman, Jerry Lawler thing from the old days of Letterman.  Rudy comes in with a neck brace on and smacks Hillary in the face. 
[58:30]
 Throw a cup of coffee on her lips.  I'd have Lewinsky in.  Like all of a sudden Monica Lewinsky just walks on and sits down next to her.  And they go, well what can we talk about?  What do we both have in common?  Oh yeah, your husband's schlong.  Now that'd be a show.  You can only pray for something like that.  It's not going to happen.  Blah, blah, blah.  Boring, boring stuff.  She's going to promote herself, bash Rudy, and then walk off. 
[59:00]
 What do you think are interesting?  Tonight, Hillary Clinton.  Hillary Clinton.  David Letterman.  And comedian Adam Ferrara.  If we have time.  Which we know now we don't.  You can go home now.  Mom and Dad.  And take those people in the balcony with you.  Yes, the big guy yelling at the page.  I thought, look, I've got to sit on the aisle because I need to go to the bathroom during a commercial.  Who's got a problem? 
[59:30]
 This is my reality.  Welcome to it.  All right, let's go back to the fellows.  But I think Psycho Mark's going to mess with people down there.  Cool.  Hopefully he'll get a message.  Yeah, he'll go to the news trucks and everything down there.  Hillary.  Barbara.  Hey.  Hey.  How are you, Barbara?  What's up, guys?  All right.  I live around the block in Stonehenge.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen some of the girls that work at night.  I can't even imagine what the day crew looks like.  What?  Don't let the sunlight hit them. 
[60:00]
 Please welcome to the main stage, Lestat.  And the place that Anthony was talking about before used to be the Bull Creek.  Oh, the Bull Creek.  That was it.  Yeah, that's what he was talking about.  Now, how are you privy to such information, Miss?  How do you know all this?  I needed to get some college.  I live on Long Island.  It's not that far.  Yeah, every Long Islander knows all that.  Remember the Brass Monkey?  That's the one I'm thinking of.  Yeah, I went to the Brass Monkey.  They were the boys.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you were there that time.  With my hair and your brother.  And someone threw a shot glass at him.  Yeah.  And I think it was one of the girls.  It was dancing. 
[60:30]
 It was amazing.  It was the girl with the hair lip.  Projectile.  Remember her?  She ran out of ping pong balls that night.  You mean us now?  Yeah.  Is that two feet?  We were goofing on her hair lip and she threw a shot glass at us.  Does she have two feet?  Yeah, she has two feet.  How about that?  All right, guys.  Have a good night.  Thank you, Barbara.  Bye.  Yeah, the Brass Monkey.  Let's see.  The carousel, I remember when I was a kid.  Yeah.  It's still there.  Yeah, sure.  It was right by the wagon.  And there was a place at the corner of Lockfield and Jericho Turnpike called the Voyage Inn. 
[61:00]
 I mean, this was going back before I could ever even dream of it.  I just remember exotic West Coast dancers.  It's like, oh, what is that?  And my father would be like, you know, all right, wait in the car.  I got to talk.  I got to talk to someone in here.  And he'd go in there and like I'd be waiting there for hours just sitting in the car.  Really?  I swear.  And he'd come out, you know, all tanked and stuff.  And the guy never made it, never met me.  Hold on.  It's like he was in there watching nudes and stuff.  Wow. 
[61:30]
 Thanks, Bob.  I was on the road.  Roll the window down a crack, could you?  I'm getting a contact.  I was in, what was it?  Oh, Green Bay, Wisconsin.  There's a strip club called Bean Snappers.  Bean Snappers?  I swear to God, you get in a car, you drive through the darkness because it's like there's no lights and nothing.  I thought you meant it was a bad neighborhood.  I thought maybe Adam was starting to get really politically incorrect.  Where's the racist balance?  So you drive through the darkness and you go to this in the middle of nowhere. 
[62:00]
 This is like where the flying saucers land.  Yeah.  They come down and looked at my ass.  So it's an empty barn.  It's a barn.  There's like linoleum on the floor.  There's a guy's, no booze because you can't have naked girls in booze, but you got to spend like four bucks for cranberry juice.  Oh, juice bar.  It's a juice bar with naked girls.  But you know the girls would drink, can I have the cranberry juice?  Why, bladder infection, I'm up next.  This is scary.  I have an inflamed urethra.  I could use the cranberry juice. 
[62:30]
 We have so many stories on the line.  Where do we want to go?  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  Yo guys, one of my favorite topics of all time.  I love the tea bars as we call them.  Oh yeah.  Patterson, New Jersey has some of the skankiest, let me tell you.  There's three in a row on Market Street.  They go from young Brazilian Russian girls and everything to like grandmothers.  This one joint moonlight.  Oh, and you can do with your clothes on, you can do almost anything in the three of them. 
[63:00]
 I'm telling you.  Oh really?  Basically buy a chick a drink and you're married to her for that night.  It's incredible.  It's just not like nothing you've ever seen.  You ever get out to New Jersey, go to Patterson Market Street, ask anybody.  Don't know what the three of them are talking about.  Well, I like the skanky bars sometimes because they really appreciate the buck.  You know, when you go to the high class strip clubs and you get the girls that really look hot,  you're not going to get anything for a buck.  You slip them a five and they give you one quick little look.  And then you need at least a twenty for a lap dance. 
[63:30]
 It's funny you say that because a hot of the chick, like the less you want to do, you know.  It's like you go to the grandmother joint and there's no rule.  Oh, you go to a skank club.  Let me tell you, skank club, the tender trap, Jericho Turnpike, right next to the radiator place.  Let me tell you something.  They got ten thousand dispensers on the wall.  Yeah.  You go in there for like a buck, you could get anything you want.  The girls appreciate that. 
[64:00]
 They look like war pigs, but for the love of God, for a buck, well, they're appreciative.  And they'll shake that flat, flabby ass right in your face.  It's Borneo.  They had the lost art in there too, Anthony.  Ah, yes.  The rug dance.  The rug dance, rug act.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Remember that?  You rarely see the rug act anymore.  No.  Remember that?  The girl would come out and she would take a little blanket.  She had that little quilt from when she was in ninth grade that Grandma quilted probably. 
[64:30]
 Put it on the floor, hit the jukebox.  This look.  We got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  Let's make it less.  And she's just like, just like raving on the floor.  She's like a praying mantis.  It's the rug act.  With her hand lotion.  Yeah, lotion.  And then she's pointing it right at you.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  She's got her legs right at you.  It's like chicken.  Who's going to flinch first?  And she's off.  Why did you blink? 
[65:00]
 I made my eyes tear.  You made me blink.  The legs are going up and apart.  Damn.  And your buddies are trying to sneak a look over your shoulder.  Like it's a peep show.  Come on, hurry up before the quarter runs out.  The rug act.  You don't say that that much anymore.  And I defy you to find a donkey show.  We've got tonight.  We've got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  The slow song.  My first strip club experience, the first song I ever heard in a strip club was House of the Rising Sun. 
[65:30]
 Really?  The house of the rising sun.  It's like when the girl tries to dance though and then does that.  Could you eject this song?  I'm not feeling it.  Eject.  And she feels like she has to cover up at that moment.  Now I'm naked.  Oh my God.  Could you eject?  I'm out of character.  This has got to start over.  Yeah.  And it makes you feel like she likes you so much.  She comes up and gives you the eyes.  She puts her breasts down towards you, grabs your dollar with her cleavage, gives you a 
[66:00]
 little smile, a little wink, a little look, stands up, turns away, takes the buck and throws it in a pile with the other hand.  Oh, I'm just a muck.  I thought she liked me this time.  I like the bachelor party.  I thought we were going to do it.  I thought we were going to go out after she got off work.  What are you doing looking at my girl?  I like the bachelor party because the bachelor's always like Kennedy drunk.  Really?  Yeah. 
[66:30]
 I was like, come on, man, look at the way that dancer's looking at you.  She likes you for you.  It's not the fact we gave her $200.  She was a person.  Out of the hundreds of bachelors she's hobbed.  She really likes you.  Hob.  Hob.  What kind of verb is that?  Hob.  To hob.  We've got a speaking code on this show.  Our buddy Foot is on the line.  Foot!  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up?  Hey, just tuned into the show.  I don't know if there's a couple of stories the guys didn't tell you about the time that  we were at the Tender Trap and Anthony started goofing on this Native American dancer. 
[67:00]
 It was an Indian.  Oh yeah, I was calling her squad.  Anthony starts going, oh, right on stage.  She got pissed.  She stops, man.  She starts yelling at Anthony.  I'm like, hmm, very sorry.  Me heap sorry.  Me pissing you off.  White man, screw me.  We open casino.  No kidding.  Hey, hey.  I dance into this swamp. 
[67:30]
 I remember that because you go, what are you going to do, make it rain?  Yeah.  She's doing a rain dance.  I don't know if Adam told this story.  When Adam was over, where the hell was he?  He went over to Billy Joel's house, knocked on the door and asked him where the carousel was.  Oh, you're going, what was I?  I was like 14 years old.  Yeah.  You knocked on Billy Joel's house?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was lost.  Yeah.  I knew who lived there.  Yeah.  I knew he lived there. 
[68:00]
 Where was that, Lloyd Neck or something?  Yeah, it was the one on the house in Lloyd Neck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ozzy was with me.  Yeah.  He goes, where the hell are we?  I said, oh, I know who lives here.  Pull over.  I know who lives here.  Oh, I did.  I saw it.  I knew he did.  He didn't know you.  What were you doing in that area?  There's nothing there.  I think we were in the fencing truck.  We were working.  Yeah.  Of course.  You can only go there during the day when you're working.  We were working during the day and we finished the job early.  I want to go back to the shop now.  Phil will put me on a forklift.  That's right.  I want to go home.  So Ozzy goes, where are we going to go?  How are we going to get out of here? 
[68:30]
 He said, pull over here.  I know the guy that lives there.  I know the guy.  Well, he goes, who lives there?  I go, you don't know him.  So I got out and knocked on the door and he came out.  Billy Joel.  And I asked him.  Did he know?  Yeah, he knew.  Like, he wasn't always Billy Joel.  He had a day job.  All right.  I got to go.  Hey, before I go, Ant, you say you're going to Thursday's show?  Sure.  You got to go to Friday's show.  Why?  Every special guest I'm seeing.  Oh, is Joseph T. Curry going to be seeing the show?

It's Adam Friar. 
[69:30]
 Hey.  Adam in studio, having lots of fun today.  Hope you're enjoying the festivities.  What are they doing?  Man, I saw NYPD Blue last night, finally.  The season premiere.  January 12th.  Season premiere.  Yeah, they pushed it way back.  What was their reasoning?  Well, I guess because it wasn't doing well in the ratings.  No, I thought it was doing very well, but they had...  They had some other show on.  I thought that's what...  They had some other show on that they...  But I thought at first that it was dipping a little bit in the ratings, so they backed  off to give this other show a chance, though?  No, they used that time slot to launch the other show, which is like that once and again 
[70:00]
 over and under.  What was the one about?  The only two divorced people.  We got caught having sex again.  Damn.  You know that one.  Yeah.  Yeah, really?  Who cares?  But NYPD Blue, very good.  Very good.  I've been watching it for a couple of years now, and I thought it was pretty good.  Rick Schroeder, always surprising the hell out of me when I see him because you expect  little Ricky Schroeder.  Sure.  And he turns out to be a pretty good actor.  Yeah, he's like a good actor. 
[70:30]
 And then the end of the show.  Ah, boobage.  Right there, Channel 7.  They're doing that like crazy.  ER had a nice boob shot.  Did they?  A few weeks back, sure.  Yeah, but ER, when they do it, it's usually some breast cancer show.  I hate that.  No, that's the truth.  It's like a double-edged sword.  It's singing a boo, but it's like, ah, you know, it's under bad circumstance.  It was Rebecca DeMore.  The advice.  Yeah.  Rebecca DeMore.  DeMore, okay.  And she was in bed on top.  And they had the, they used to have just the back shot of the, you know, the topless woman 
[71:00]
 with the other door.  Oh, they're swinging that camera around.  They're swinging the camera around now, and it's like side, leading toward front boob  shots now.  Yeah, Rick Schroeder was with this chick last night.  It was an armpit view.  Well, it's even more so.  It's an angle.  I mean, it's everything but the nip.  He's making out with this girl and stuff and like grinding on her and everything.  And then the camera kind of goes around to see side boob.  And she had some, oh yeah, major dairy.  Bring in stunt breasts.  Yeah, they were very nice.  And then the camera kept going around a little more, and you see a little more of the boob. 
[71:30]
 Channel 7, I'm like, well, look at this.  And didn't he use the P word last night?  Yeah, take a piss?  Oh yeah, well, I don't know if we could say that.  We did.  I don't know if we made it out over the air.  If they say it on Network TV, why can't we say it on the radio?  I don't know.  There's a different set of rules.  Take a pee.  Take a pee, they said, but they used the real word.  Right.  And Zippowitz grabbed his schlong.  His junk.  His junk.  Shook it at some guy.  His junk. 
[72:00]
 It makes a metal sound.  We have code words for everything on the show, Adam.  Oh, we're using the word scumbag.  Scumbag and skills.  Skills.  Oh, I love that when they, what was that thing?  What do they call it when the cops are beating up the guy?  Keied him up a little or?  They keyed up a scale.  God damn, that show rolls.  We keyed up a scale.  Very nice.  Don't come up to me because I'm keying up some skeleton.  That deserved it.  I got stuck watching. 
[72:30]
 Kiss my junk.  I want to be a millionaire.  You watched I want to be a millionaire?  I'm a millionaire.  Gelman.  It's like crack though.  I don't know why I want to watch that.  Is that your final answer?  It's the stupidest show on TV, but I watch it every time I'm flipping around.  Yeah, but you know something?  If I was on that show and you let you make that phone call, I wouldn't call anyone I know because they're idiots.  If I called you, first of all, I couldn't get through because of your phone system, man.  Joan of Arc has an easier time delivering a message than calling this guy. 
[73:00]
 The party's not accepting messages.  Please face Mecca, last the blanket, let the smoke signals rise, and he'll get to you by the power of your intention.  How badly do you want to speak to him?  That is true, Ed.  Is it?  Yeah.  I never try to call me.  You should.  It kills me because we have decisions to make and stuff, and now Aunt is like you just take a hold of them.  Oh, come on.  Oh, come on.  My phone?  It's right here.  You don't turn it on, though.  You don't turn it on. 
[73:30]
 Maybe there's a message on here.  Yeah.  There's probably a few.  You know all that messages.  Flash, Anthony, lucky Lindy made it.  The French go wild.  Doughboy's hit Europe.  Now, come on.  Babe hits home run, saves off his life.  X-ray, X-ray.  X-ray, X-ray.  I would use a fake.  How would you use a fake?  It takes, you know, out back in a bay, it comes on, it says, you're a voice mail. 
[74:00]
 Oh, it's horrible.  You have like a six hour delay.  Yeah.  If we want to like try to make plans with you for dinner, we better call it like 10 in the morning.  I called you to get a beer and shoot pool in 1974.  I just got that one.  I know.  I remember it.  How funny is it to see Anthony with technology, though?  Oh, he always had technology.  He had, you were on the internet.  You had the AP wire into that, well, I was in the apartment.  Remember the honeycomb hideout?  Yeah.  Well, he had an AP wire hooked in that he got into like 10th.  Yeah, really? 
[74:30]
 I had, what I had was my Commodore 64 computer hooked up to my black and white television.  Right.  And I was online with a 300 baud motor.  Yeah.  Not mega baud, people.  Not kilobaud.  I'm talking 300 baud.  That was it.  And I used to go to these chat rooms and play trivia.  The question would come up.  I'd type it in, a sentence in text.  One sentence text would take like a minute to transmit all that. 
[75:00]
 And we were sitting there mesmerized.  You know what it was like?  I'm online.  It was like we were terrorists because we had all this technology and in a hovel.  You know what?  And we had like...  And you didn't have enough rent money, right?  No, and we just just beer.  Didn't have no rent money.  There was no rent money.  The place was falling down.  I remember that.  It was like I had to come up with money for rent or go to Toys R Us and buy a Commodore  64.  So we're online.  Yeah, absolutely.  Trying to hide from the landlord.  Landlord.  Landlord.  He used to come banging on the door.  And hide. 
[75:30]
 Yeah, hide.  And hide.  And Adam's like, your car's outside, you idiot.  Where are you going to hide?  I'm out.  Hide.  Don't say anything.  Tell him I'm not here.  He'll go away.  He always goes away.  It's like I'm a squatter.  He was funny because every time the landlord would knock on the door, he's like, Elmer  Fudd, play dead.  He won't hurt you.  He thinks you're dead.  And he was like this big bear came sniffing around and Anthony's just sitting there like  a little kid.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead. 
[76:00]
 And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  And he was like, I'm going to go play dead.  He doesn't check the walls.  You know, it was easy for him because since we never paid him,  we never asked them to do anything.  Because we never wanted him there.  So you know, if there was a hole in the wall or something or a leak, who can?  He made it work for you.  We'll live with it.  We'll live with it.  We'll live with it.  We'll live with it.  We live with it a lot.  There was like those bullet holes from the BB gun.  That was from us.  We were shooting the wall.  It's like, oh my god, there's bullet holes in the wall. 
[76:30]
 Oh, that was us.  You have to check out your new rifles when you buy them.  You can't be bothered with driving down in the rain.  You just blow off a few into the wall.  Guns don't kill people.  Anthony kills people.  I don't think I've ever killed anything.  You've named and I have the scar to prove it.  Hey, Dave, you're next on the show.  What's up?  Hey, boys, great hour, first of all.  It's as funny as hell.  Having fun with my pal, Adam.  I got one of the sickest go-go stories ever. 
[77:00]
 I used to bounce at a bar in central Jersey.  I'm sitting by the door to one day and this lady comes in.  Now, she looks about 50 years old, but she could have been 100 years old.  All disheveled.  She's carrying this little bag and she comes over to me and she's like, I'm here for my  audition.  I'm like, wait a minute, do you have the right place here?  Look what kind of bar this is.  She's like, oh yeah, I set this up with the manager.  So I show her where to go get changed. 
[77:30]
 She comes in about 15 minutes later.  She's got this long black-like sundress on.  So I say to her, I'm like, you know, I hope you're losing that once you get up on stage.  And as I'm looking at her, I'm really thinking, well, I hope you really don't lose this when  you get up on stage.  So she gets up on stage, she dances around for a while.  All of a sudden, the sundress comes off and all I hear is just groans from these guys at  the end of the bar.  I get up, I walk down the other end, I look at her.  First of all, the bellies hanging over this little pink bikini that she's got on. 
[78:00]
 Man, tell me more.  And she's got candy hose on, which right there I'm going, holy Christ.  And then this guy goes, oh my God, it's her time of the month.  Look at the size of that pad that she's got on.  Exactly.  I never saw guys clear out of a bar quicker in my whole life.  I'm like, lady, you've got to get off the stage right now.  You're killing business, man.  Oh, man.  That's funny.  I wonder why they hire them.  It was frightening, guys.  All right, Dave, thank you. 
[78:30]
 See you, guys.  All right, let's go to Luke.  That's what it was also.  I've got to say, the term is tuned up.  Tuned up.  Not keyed up.  OK.  The cops tuned them up.  Tuned up?  What the hell?  He was a little rough.  We tuned them up.  We tuned them up a little.  Tuned up.  They needed a tune up.  I love it.  What did you do?  I had to go out and tune up a scale.  Now tell me how to do my job.  There's a retired cop in the line.  John, what's up?  Yeah.  I'm talking about, you know, with a guy.  We used to give him an option.  We used to take him out on the back.  So you want to tune him up or, you know, you could take him and write you up. 
[79:00]
 One or the other.  Tune up or write up.  That was it.  You know, I'm going to...  So when you tuned them up, what did that entail?  You'd smack them around a little bit just so he saw your point of view a little bit  better than he had before you picked them up.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, I'm tuned up.  You can't do it now because they got the frigging cameras all over the place.  Yeah.  And then photographs and the cars going through the intersections and everything else.  Yeah, and then there's video cameras.  They got them in the cars.  Yeah. 
[79:30]
 Now, did you ever have to change somebody's mind or way of thinking?  Of course.  Yeah, a couple of tone-ups in your day.  It was a lot easier in the early 70s, let me put it that way.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But you know, these guys didn't respect.  That's exactly what the whole show was about.  You're talking about the COVID, right?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Why?  Come on, I'm kidding.  Jesus Christ.  I'm making a joke.  Yeah, he didn't respect the band or anybody else.  That's what it boils down to.  And then we had a guy say it.  That's horrifying. 
[80:00]
 Oh, the COVID.  I would've hit him too.  I would've killed him.  Like this morning.  All right, John.  All right, take care.  Thank you.  He says early 70s.  That was a term used back then.  The early 70s.  Not the 1870s.  What was that?  Good googly moo.  It's the office.  What the hell was that?  The early 70s.  I had to tune up chicken joe.  Hey, Luke, you're next on WNEW.  Hello.  Hey, you're up.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  I just want to tell you guys a quick story.  There's a deli up in Middletown that is a topless deli.  Ugh, a topless deli.  Yeah, it's the strangest thing in the world.  I was up there with a friend of mine.  I was helping him out doing some work, and we were just driving around seeing what's going  on. 
[80:30]
 You know, it was tough to get a soda or whatever.  And we go into this place to get like a sandwich or stuff, and we were just driving around and  we were just driving around and seeing what's going on.  You know, it was tough to get a soda or whatever.  And we go into this place to get like a sandwich or stuff, and we look in the back, and there's  this back room, and there's this chick dancing around, and there's a guy sitting down at  the table eating a sandwich.  Some things don't mix, man.  Yeah, it was real wrong.  I don't know.  It was weird.  I'm not familiar. 
[81:00]
 I don't really know exactly where it is.  It was like pretty much in nowhere up there.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I put it out.  How does she slice the ham?  What then?  Oh, the pepperoni.  Well, the pepperoni.  How do you get over the slicer if you're a topless?  Well, it was like a cutout.  It was like a pepper room just for that, and in the back it was weird.  Oh, deli and dancing?  Yeah, pretty much.  Like a bodega.  That's great.  All right, Luke.  All right, thank you.  Thanks, you.  Yeah, I never even went for like walking to some of these strip clubs and they got the 
[81:30]
 the big 10-foot hero or something.  I didn't even want to go over there.  They had to bring it through the back door.  You know that?  What else is happening in that back room?  Imagine just biting into it all of a sudden.  Oh, a condom.  All right.  It's like that Little Rascals episode with the cake when a hair brush was...  Wee wah.  Wee wah.  Wee wah.  Wee wah.  Wee wah.  I like my brush.  My brush.  I like my brush.  I like my brush.  I like my brush.

I like my brush.  I like my brush.  I like my brush.  I was just hearing the beat and then the rest of the song came in.  No, I kicked it.  I'm sorry. 
[83:00]
 Channel 11 was playing the honeymooners marathon over the New Year's Eve holiday.  And all of a sudden, Saturday morning comes, 8 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the morning, they  switch to like Pokemon.  Pokemon?  That would piss off a lot of people.  And the listing in the paper and stuff said it was going to be a marathon all the way  until 6 o'clock on Saturday night.  But they know they can make all kinds of money by putting the Pokemon on from all the commercials  that they run.  Right.  So they totally took the honeymooners off until noon. 
[83:30]
 And then put them back on.  Aw.  People calling up?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  You know honeymooners fans.  What are you doing with Pokemon?  Norton.  It's this wise guy in a Weizenheimer.  Cranmars.  Distinguished mystery meat appetizers.  We're off.  What's up about Pokemon?  I don't know, Norton.  I did not like the entertainers in mind.  Remember?  Tommy Short and the Stoy Piano.  Little Jack Little.  Basil Fomin.  Who was in the movie they were watching?  What?  Oh yeah.  Jane Friese, Buddy Epson. 
[84:00]
 Jane Friese.  Yeah, and Buddy Epson.  Yeah.  You guys did watch a lot of TV.  I don't remember that one.  That was the one with the TV.  That's the video.  Video ranges.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  No video ranges.  Nothing video.  We went around the room.  Stereo.  We had a coat.  I go on a date, and I set up Jimbo.  We've got another friend Jimbo.  We set him up on his blind date. 
[84:30]
 The girl I was seeing at the time, her friend, and I go look, just give me a signal if you  don't like this girl.  So, we're sitting out at dinner, and in the middle of a conversation, he stands up and  Oh, it sure looks like rain tonight!  Wow.  They used to have some funny stuff on that show that you couldn't even get away with  now.  Yeah.  Like with Garrity, remember when Garrity was mouthing off to Cramden?  Ralph Cramden sticks his head out the window and goes, home a little early tonight, Garrity, 
[85:00]
 would the saloon burn down?  You go to them strip clubs during the day, aren't you?  You get lazy, Garrity!  Hey Ralph, mind if I smoke?  I don't care if you burn!  We watched him for hours.  The apartment was, I swear to God, Pee-wee's Playhouse.  Yeah.  Toys, TV, and beer.  That guy wants to talk like Ralph for you guys.  Glenn? 
[85:30]
 Yeah?  You're on the air, man.  Hang on.  We don't need a telephone, Alice!  Get it taken out!  If you don't have a motorboat with three propellers, I'll ghost on the road.  He'll never figure it out.  No.  We're on a 40-second delay, so he doesn't believe when we say you're on the air.  You're on the air.  No, I'm not.  He's too busy listening to the show in the background.  I listen.  Ant, the market is closed.  Gotta get our numbers.  Gotta check our stats.  Just don't say what stock you have, Alpie.  Okay.  I don't know if there's some kind of connection.  I don't know if there's some kind of connection.  I don't know if there's some kind of connection.  Let's see.  Do you make any money today?  I'm looking.  On the stock market?  Well, the problem is, like, right at 4 o'clock between, like, 4 and 4.15 every day, I believe  everyone pounds E-Trade to see how they did to get their numbers.  Well, you're still going to get a 20-minute delayed price on there. 
[86:00]
 Yeah, that's true, too.  Because the market closed.  Okay.  So, we're going to have to wait for the stock market to close.  Okay.  So, we're going to have to wait for the stock market to close.  Okay.  So, we're going to have to wait for the stock market to close.  Okay.  So, we're going to have to wait for the stock market to close.  Okay.

I heard that Monica is selling bags around the corner.  Monica is around the corner?  She's selling bags.  Monica is selling bags around the corner.  We just found out.  Yeah, that's what she does now.  She sells bags.  She's had so many across her nose.  She knows a lot about bags.  She knows bags.  So what's the scene out there, Psycho Mark?  Well, they've got the street all blocked off.  They've got Secret Service agents crawling everywhere.  Not your secret? 
[117:00]
 No, not at all.  They've got them on buildings.  There's a guy up on a building up on the left.  There's a guy up in the back of the building.  There's a guy up in the building on the right.  And they are not letting anybody stop right here.  It's like a total cordoned off area.  Who asked the Secret Service where was he at the book suppository building?  That will help.  That will get you friends.  Well, I mean, Mark's got a couple hundred people around him and we're trying to figure  out something cool they could all chat.  I don't know.  People, they kind of seem sort of stupefied here today.  They're going to be like, go in here, look at this.  That's the nerve gas that the Secret Service let out. 
[117:30]
 I'm not one for conspiracy theories, but I know they do that.  If any of our listeners have an idea, give us a call.  Get rid of all the stripper phone calls.  Keep the nigga Charlie calls and see if anyone comes up with a chant for Psycho Mark.  I'm on the phone here.  OK.  Something about our First Lady Hillary Clinton.  How close is the Secret Service from you?  They are standing right in front of me.  There's about, I'd say about 15 agents all surrounding the block.  They're not letting anybody walk in front of... 
[118:00]
 Why don't you start, take the megaphone and just start...  Ask him his name.  Can we see your piece?  Oh my God.  I'm not getting caught.  Can we see your piece?  Hey, can we see your piece?  Hey, you're nuts.  Did you see when Reagan got shot?  All of a sudden the Secret Service guys had like handheld howitzers.  They came out of their jackets and stuff.  One guy had a gun, I swear to God, it was some kind of machine gun I've never seen in my life.  Huge.  And he was keeping it. 
[118:30]
 He was like in short sleeve shirt and in shorts.  All of a sudden he pulled it out of somewhere.  You've got to watch them guys, Mark.  Hey, the Secret Service just came over to me and they asked me if I'm going to be using the bullhorn.  They probably put me in a milfoil and fiber thing.  So you know what you do?  You go right in his face and throw the bullhorn and go, no!  I go right in his face and go, what?  No way.  The guy's like 6'5 and he's black and I'm not dead.  And he's black.  That's niggatonic.  I'm telling you. 
[119:00]
 Law and order.  Defending the First Lady.  Want me to see if he starred in the movie?  Yeah, that'll get you killed.  Oh yeah, there you go.  Hey, have you ever seen the movie?  Oh, never mind.  Mark, hold on a sec.  Someone's very pissed at us.  Hold on.  We'll go right back to you.  What do we do?  Richard.  Hello.  Hi.  Hey Dick, what's up man?  How you doing?  You have no respect.  I mean, this is fellow New Yorkers.  Don't curse.  Why?  Why are you cursing?  Hangs up.  What a puss.  We ran out of delay so we had to get rid of Mr. Head. 
[119:30]
 If people want to, you know, bitch about us, we don't care.  We'll put you on the air.  But for God's sake, you can't curse.  Hillary sucks, Monica blows.  They're trying to think of a real good chance for Mark to start out there.  Whip him out.  It is whipping out Wednesday.  You guys are getting some good phone calls there, huh?  Yeah.  Hey Mark, what's up?  Nothing.  I'm standing right here in the Secret Service.  I'm standing right in front of my face.  Oh really?  Yeah, they're right here. 
[120:00]
 What's the Secret Service?  What's the guy's name?  I don't know.  But here she comes.  She's coming right now.  Here, get the sign out Earl.  I got Earl with me here.  What sign you got?  I got the big wild sign.  Come on Earl.  Oh I thought you had, Hillary is a...  Hey Hillary!  Uh oh.  Uh oh, I'll get the seat now or they're going to get mad at me.  This guy just pointed at me.  Say hey Hillary, where's Bill's schlong?  Hey Bill!  Oh I'm getting lots of messages. 
[120:30]
 Look at the puppies Earl.  Hillary!  Hillary!  Show us your fun bags!  Show us your fun bags.  Oh God I'm going to get motion.  Hillary!  Oh that's it, she's already got inside.  That was two seconds.  That was that fast.  That was it.  That was fast.  That was so fast.  Barely enough time for anyone to squeeze off a shot.  How could you miss?  I just see Rudy.  Damn it I had her right in my crosshairs. 
[121:00]
 I did one peep with this bullhorn and that was it.  I was just about to get a little bead on me with her 9mm.  Hillary.  You know there was some guy on the...  Hillary shows your fun bags he said.  I'm scared.  Because he's politically active.  Now we can cross the street.  Fun bags for peace.  That's it huh?  That was it.  It was like a 5 second deal.  She gave her a cheesy little smile. 
[121:30]
 She sort of flashed one of her cans and then went right ahead.  What did she get out of the limo and stuff?  I got some stupid bear and it kind of looks like the N.A.W.  except it's a little bit nicer.  It's probably armor plated.  There's no armor on that thing.  I could spit on it and break a window.  You're good.  Something electric for you.  Don wants you to chant I want a cigar.  I want a cigar!  I want a cigar!  I want a cigar! 
[122:00]
 Are there still people there?  They're just staring at me.  Like a retoy.  There's some guy yelling down the street over here.  He's got a sign and he's screaming obscenities.  Alright go to him.  Let's see what's going on.  I'm going to go find out.  This guy looks really sick.  That's what we want.  Get ready on the dump.  Get ready for the dump.  Alright.  What do you think about Hillary?  It piles up. 
[122:30]
 It piles up.  It piles up.  What?  What are you doing with these little wacky horns?  Listen in.  I'm telling you.  He's not telling me.  Alright, ask him what he's there for.  What are you here for today?  The bar.  The bar he said.  That sounds fine out of his head.  He's got one of those little stupid horns.  Yeah.  He's got that and the Secret Service is yelling at you. 
[123:00]
 Yeah really.  Hey what do you think about Hillary Clinton?  I don't want to talk to you.  Good Lord.  Follow him.  Get right in his face.  Talk to him through the bullhorn.  He's going to cut off my...  It's nut wars.  He's going to cut my horn off?  What did he say?  He's going to cut off my...  Alright, we say Mark.  Mark. 
[123:30]
 Tell him through the bullhorn that the UFOs know where he is.  The UFOs know where you are.  The UFOs know where you are.  They're coming for you.  Get them all paranoid.  Watch out, the UFOs are coming for you.  They're coming.  I can see them right now.  They'll blow over your horn and you're going to disappear.  What am I doing here with the horns?  My eyes bang on. 
[124:00]
 My eyes bang on.  What is he saying?  What is he babbling about?  I don't know.  He's talking and I'm going to cut your...  ...pussy off and stuff like that.  It's horrible.  He's drunk.  He's completely drunk out of his mind.  Anyhow, I'm going to get back over and see what the rest of the goons are doing.  Alright, man.  We've got to take a quick break, Mark.  If anything happens, give us a call back, alright?  I'm going to try and do it. 
[124:30]
 There's some TV news crews down here.  Me and Earl got the big wild sign.  We're going to try and get on TV and mess up some newscasts.  Get the bullhorn ready when they go live?  Oh, yeah.  What do you want me to say?  What channels are out there?  They've got Channel 2, channels...  All the channels are here.  Fox News, everybody.  Alright.  When they go live, get the megaphone and just start chanting Whip Him Out Wednesday or something.  Alright.  We'll check in with you in a bit.  Alright, guys.  There you go.  Psycho Mark, everyone.

And unfortunately, they spotted me.  I'm the only guy walking around with a bullhorn, so it's not too hard to miss me.  What, the Secret Service came up to you?  Yeah, the Secret Service came right up to me.  They were pissed.  They were pissed.  They did not like the fun bags comment.  That was a little loud there. 
[126:00]
 What about the news?  Yeah, what about the news?  What about the news?  Yeah, the news crews on to you?  I'm waiting for Channel 2.  They're about to go up right within the next 10 minutes.  I'm waiting for Earl to signal me, but he's busy looking at some chicks, so I'm not going  to get a signal from him.  Okay.  But I'm waiting for her to go up and do live and then I'm just going to flash my big wild  sign.  Oh, that's cool.  We'll be watching.  Yeah, we're watching.  We're watching as you speak, Mark.  As the world turns.

 You got me over here on the other side of the console.  Like the kids say.  Yeah, that looks like a psychopath with a bullhorn.  It's a bus tanker truck.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up?  What's the deal?  Not much.  Okay, anyway, I saw when you guys were talking like two days ago about the legend Naked Charlie  and that first came up with the clip from the internet, because I have no life, I ran  right out and got it at Kin's video in Manhattan.  They got all this stuff.  I took it home, I watched it. 
[127:30]
 It's the greatest Black Western I've ever seen in my entire life.  Really?  Yeah, we're looking forward to checking out that movie for ourselves.  What's up?  Go ahead.  You like the movie, you laughed, yeah?  I laughed, I cried.  And I have a good feeling about it.  I laughed, I cried, listening to you.  And there was brief nudity in it and I just felt like, kind of like just really African  afterwards.  All right, thank you, Mark.  All right.  Chris, thank you, Chris.  Take it easy.  All right, bye. 
[128:00]
 So the film does exist.  Yeah, we're very distracted.  Oh, yeah.  Mark.  Yeah?  Coming up, they said they're doing the Hillary piece.  Oh, they get a little tease.  Is the reporter right near you?  Yeah, the reporter.  I am standing right behind her, dude.  All right, don't let them onto you quite yet.  Look at him.  It's kind of too late.  Why?  It's, you know, she sort of spotted me.  Yeah, but they have to.  They still have to go on, man.  They have to go on, man.  Because wow.  Who's asking you about your sign?  Oh, the reporter.  Oh, damn it.  Don't worry about it.  You have balls. 
[128:30]
 I do.  I have huge balls.  Tell her it means wow because you're happy to be here.  She doesn't know what it means.  Flip it over and have it say Hillary is a C.  No way.  You guys will have to dump me.  All right.  Can I say hi to my mother?  I want to say hi to mom.  There you go.  All right.  You want to see if the reporter will wow?  All right.  I'm going to say hi to my mom.  All right.  I'm going to say hi to my mom.  All right.  I'm going to say hi to my mom.  All right.  I'm going to say hi to my mom.  All right.  I'm going to say hi to my mom.  All right.  You want to see if the reporter will wow us?  No, they're going to go to her any second. 
[129:00]
 Any second, man.  Yeah.  Any second.  We're going to hold her up high.  Yeah, we've got to keep you on the line here.  We've got to talk to Anthony on Line 7, his friends in jail for threatening Hillary.  Really?  What's the problem?  All right.  I think they're ready to go to her.  Hold that up high, will you?  I'm almost ready.  We've got to synchronize.  All right.  Date with Dave.  Steven Clark, Channel 2 News.  Come on, Mark.  David, David, David.  David, David.  Come on, Mark.  This is like interactive TV.  Come on.  This is good.  You get to screw with the TV and watch it at the same time.  We've got a joystick.  We can move Mark around.  This is what the future is like. 
[129:30]
 There he is.  With the huge cross-cut.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Yeah.  Look at my hand.  Jumping around like a nut.  Fuck you, Mark.  Mark, you're a loser.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark.  Come on, Mark. 
[130:00]
 What happened, Mark?  What happened, Mark?  Some CBS guy just jumped in front of you.  You looked like a stark raving lunatic.  That was classic, man.  Dude, it was hilarious.  They were like, move over.  Move over.  He was right over.  Dude, are they going to go back to it?  the guys in the truck came over and ripped my side out of my head.  Oh, come on.  Did they?  Yeah, I don't see them.  Oh, you're friggin' lunatic, man. 
[130:30]
 That was hilarious, man.  They gotta go back.  They gotta go back.  They're going back.  What are you gonna do when they come back?  You got the bullhorn, right?  Oh, you got the bullhorn.  Bullhorn.  Say, uh.  Yeah, because the guy's about to punch my teeth out.  And we work for the same company.  Come on, we work for the same company.  Say hello to them.  No, this is a cross promotion.  Oh, he's so mad.  He's so mad.  He's so mad.  He's so mad.  He's so mad.  He's so mad.  You were like screaming.  It was hysterical.  Dude, you're a pizza.  It was hilarious.  I mean, we gotta explain this for everyone stuck in their car. 
[131:00]
 It's like interactive TV.  We got Channel 2 news on.  They go live outside Letterman Studio.  There's Mark with the hugest wow sign you'll ever see.  But all you see on TV is like half the O and the second W.  So we're like, move over, move over.  Oh, here he is.  Where are you, Mark?  Where are you, Mark?  They're back to you.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back.  Where are you, Mark?  They're back to you.  Oh, I got some reinforcements at least.  Get behind her.  Get behind her.  They're back live.  Are they back on?  Yeah. 
[131:30]
 There you go.  There's the wow sign again.  We can see it!  Look out!  Look out!  Higher, higher!  Chance, whip him out.  Whip him out.  Whip up!  Whip them up!  Whip them up!  Whip them up!  Whip them up!  Whip them up!  Whip them up!  Whip them up!  Whip them up!  Whip them up!  Whip them up!  Move to the side real fast.  Move to the side.  Move over.  Move over.  God damn it, that's the funniest thing. 
[132:00]
 Hold on a second, Mark.  Hold on.  Hold on a second, Mark.  Butch is in the studio from the radio check.  I'm listening to you guys, but I'm listening to the TV at the same time.  She's standing there and Anthony says, say, whip him out.  So they're yelling, whip him out.  Butch is trying to do the rest of the report.  So as she's closing the report, she looks back and she says, as you can hear, it's getting  loud out here.  We're calling the police.  They can't call the police.  Hey Mark.  Yeah.  That was hilarious.  Well done.  Bravo Mark. 
[132:30]
 Now that's interactive television right there.  It's not, she's not very happy.  Oh, come on.  Who's not happy?  Marcia Clary.  She's very mad at me.  You tell her, go to...

Yeah, hysterical.  Oh my, it was priceless.  I just want to tell you guys, man, that was hilarious.  All right, we got to go back to Mark.  He's getting in trouble.  Psycho Mark, what's up?  Dude, I almost got a tune up from the cop.  You almost got a tune up? 
[137:30]
 I almost got a tune up.  What happened?  Well, the cop comes over and he's like, pissed.  And he's looking right in my face and he's like, dude,  Is your microphone on?  I'm like, no, sir, no, sir, it's not.  So he grabs me, pulls me around the corner.  He goes, look, I wasn't hoping anything all the time.  Just do me a favor.  Get out of here, will you?  And I just like, you know, took the lady back.  I was going to get back to the girl from CBS.  She was mad.  She's like, oh, good, the cops are going to arrest him now.  And the cop takes me around the corner. 
[138:00]
 He's just like, dude, I love this show, but you've got to move on.  All right?  Give somebody else the sign.  So are you done, you think, or what?  Well, I kind of am because I'm getting nasty looks.  There's one guy from CBS here.  It looks like he's calling the head honcho.  He's describing me as I look.  You boy can't be doing that.  What the hell you boy did?  You're interrupting our own news broadcast, for God's sake.  All right, Mark.  Dude, it's so funny.  I got the Secret Service all in front of the theater here.  And they're locked all the doors to the theater. 
[138:30]
 And nobody's getting in and out.  Mark, the phone's going nuts.  Everyone is peeing in their pants.  Dude, I'm going to probably head back to the station.  The deed has been done.  All right, no problem.  And I don't think I'm going to get any more exposure here  because they were about the only people alive.  All right, man.  Bye.  We'll see you when you get back.  All right, guys.  Psycho Mark, everyone, he's back.  Yeah, a little interactive television there for our show.  Oh, God, was that so freaking funny. 
[139:00]
 The funniest thing is it's one thing to just hold up a sign  in front of a live broadcast.  It's another to hold it up and jump around and yell like a stark, raving madman.  Did you see him in that clip?  It's still another thing to be able to direct the guy doing that.  Yeah, direct the guy doing it.  We're the new Steven Spielberg here at the Raven Station.  But it's so funny.  He's jumping up and down.  Yeah, yeah.  But you know what the funniest thing to me is when you said move to the left  and he did it.  That kills me. 
[139:30]
 We're watching TV.  He's moving.  He's moving.  He's moving.  Those were so easily into what he said.  You know, he's going to hold up a wow sign.  I thought it was going to be like a tiny two by three foot sign.  Now that was my God.  It was so freaking.  About Wednesday.  Classic.  It was classic.  Jesse, what's up?  That guy's insane.  You should see the tape.  Yeah, we saw it.  Oh, I'm dying.  Oh, you taped it. 
[140:00]
 You got a copy of the tape?  Oh, we got to see that.  Get a copy for the website.  He looks sick.  He looks insane.  He's like a madman.  He's like Stutterin' John and Crackhead Bob put together.  Oh, don't say that.  He's doing his own thing.  Oh, are you sure?  Thank you, Jesse.  Bye.  Bye.  Huh?  We'll get a copy of the tape.  We'll get a copy of the tape.  Sean, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  I got a copy of the tape for you guys.  Yeah, cool.  Awesome.  Can you hold on the line?  Sure, yeah.  All right, cool.  We'll have you come down within everything.  You can check out the show.  All right, thanks. 
[140:30]
 All right, hold on.  Ben will talk to you.  Steve, you're next.  Sorry, man.  Hey, Steve, you're up.  Yeah, how you doing?  All right.  I just want to thank you guys for curing me of the flu.  I just had to diet coke through my nose.  I'm laughing so hard.  Awesome.  I can breathe in five days.  The show has the power to heal.  Yes.  Thank you very much.  All right, Steve.  The phones are just nuts.  Bob.  That was so funny.  What?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

[143:00]
 I'm pissing in my pants.  There's so many people in their cars.  It was the funniest thing ever.  There's got to be a few cars on the side of the road.  All right.  Hey, Adam.  What's up, brother?  How are you?  All right, man.  You're going to see Adam at Governor's this weekend?  Are you going to go?  Yeah, I'm going like tomorrow.  All right, man.  Give me a buzz or something.  Maybe we'll hook up and check it out.  Cool.  There he is.  There he is.  Psycho Mark.  Bill, we got to fly.  Hi, boys.  Take a look.

He's wearing his sweaters.  It's got fur on the arms.  It's Taylor.  Taylor?  The mobile producer was so mad at me.  He wanted to knock my teeth down.  He wanted to tune me up.  Tune you up?  We're going to catch the heaps.  Yeah, we're going to catch hell for that, guaranteed.  We're going to catch a lot of heaps for that one.  Uh-oh.  Let's go to Tom real fast.  Tom, what's up?  Yo. 
[144:00]
 Yeah?  You guys almost broke my freaking ankle.  I ran down the stairs to see what the hell was going on.  And you ever see somebody walking on water or something?  I fell down the freaking stairs and almost cracked my head open because I had to see  what the hell was going on.  That was the worst thing I've ever seen.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.

Who was the chick though that we heard yelling at?  That was her.  Oh, that was her?  That was Marcia?  Yeah, that was Marcia.  Ryan?  Yeah, I just want to know, guys, when is the farewell show going to be?  That's why you've got to listen every day. 
[145:00]
 That could be it right here today.  You never know.  You never know.  And I'm surprised that Mark made it back without getting shook up by the Secret Service.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Bye, man.  Wow.  They're just coming in like crazy.  Mark?  Yeah?  What's up?  How you doing?  Alright.  Hey, listen, I'm racing home.  I'm about a half a mile from work.  I hear you guys on the radio.  I think I picked off two old ladies in front of the shop right in Rockville Park.  I'm driving.  I go, I find out my block 70 miles an hour. 
[145:30]
 I just parked my car in the middle of the street and raced the stairs.  I'm still watching Channel 2.  I'm still watching Channel 2.  See, we gave a lot of publicity.  Channel 2 news rocks.  How can they get mad at you guys?  We might need you for a character witness.  I'm telling you right now, I'm watching a little show about little kids right now.  I can't turn the radio on, you know?  I had that delay thing.  But I'm going to buy the, I'm going to advertise.  I've got Lee Cowan in Washington, D.C. right now.  Don't, you guys don't worry about it.  You guys are funny guys.  Alright, Mark, thank you.  Very funny.  See you later.  Alright, bye.  We're in the company. 
[146:00]
 We don't mean to, but it just happens that way.  I know.  Yeah, but it's good publicity for them.  Oh, yeah.  You tell the big boss when he reams us out again.  Jimmy.  Yeah, the funniest thing happened.  Yeah.  My dad's driving me home from drug rehab, right?  Dude, he almost rear-ended a cop car.  We're laughing so hard.  Cops pull him over.  He ended me.  My dad's playing in the situation.  The cop just burst out laughing.  He let my dad go because he was listening to you guys too.  Oh, awesome.  I almost in tears when you pulled us over.  Awesome.  Yeah. 
[146:30]
 Cool.  I'm going to let you guys know.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Okay.  Oh, God damn.  There's one guy's doing a bong hit, the other guy's coming home from rehab.  We're proud of our listeners.  Yes.  They don't aim high.  Rob.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Alright.  Mark, I got one question for you.  Yeah.  How do you walk around with that set, you guys?  What do you like?  Walk around like John Wayne, just swaying like?  I mean, you should be up for like a daytime Emmy with that performance.  He comes into the studio with a wheelbarrow for his jump.  Oh, God. 
[147:00]
 I got a small one-room apartment.  My living room and my kitchen are connected.  Yeah.  I'm listening to the radio in the living room.  I had to see Channel 2.  I'm fucking into my bedroom because my TV's busted in the living room.  I hit the linoleum floor, spill, I cracked my head on the floor.  You guys almost killed me.  Know how funny that was?  When they went back to Stephen Clark, he had a real tough time not smiling.  You could see like his mouth was like.  Yeah.  Well, I got an instant feedback here.  I don't know about this.  It seems real.  This guy from the CBS control room, he goes, God, I'm in the CBS control room. 
[147:30]
 We almost went off the air.  All the technicians were on the floor.  What do you got there?  We know that Stephen Clark listens to this show because Mark and I met him once,  and he listens to you guys.  He told us that.  Mike Adams, Mark?  Yeah, is that Mike Adams, Mark?  Was he?  Yeah.  He loves you guys.  The guy was definitely cracking a smile when they came back.  All right, listen, we definitely got to take a break. 
[148:00]
 We went like 20 minutes longer than we're supposed to.  And consult an attorney.  Yeah, we got to.  Oh, please don't.  We're screwed again.  Yeah, but it's always fun.  What the hell?  All right, we got to take a break.  It might be a little longer than usual, but please stay right there.  Okay, we'll be back with more of your phone calls.  All right?  Opie and Anthony.  Someone get this pen out of my nose.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, it's Opie and Anthony. 
[148:30]
 We're in the middle of a pretty long commercial break  because we just talked for like 50 straight minutes.  So please hang in there.  A bunch of other people on the lines that have comments about Mark's little  wow TV stunt outside the Letterman studio.  They're all just losing it outside the studio.  But we apologize.  We're in the middle of a long commercial break.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  1027 WNEW, we're back.  It's Opie and Anthony at Farrar.  God, that was funny. 
[149:00]
 And our new hero, Psycho Mark in the studio.  Psycho Mark, a stark-raving madman with balls the size of globes.  Unbelievable.  They hum when he walks.  Unbelievable.  Got an email here from Nick from Jersey.  Okay, that stunt proves it.  You guys are the funniest, most f-ed up people I've ever seen.  The delay made it more bizarre because he was watching as we were talking.  We have the delay to deal with.  But some people said it was funnier that way.  Cool.  I think it's worth the punishment that you guys should be getting. 
[149:30]
 I just hope you live through it.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Well, you know, you got to go for it where you can.  And sometimes there's things called friendly fire, you know?  Like we're just throwing this crap out there.  And unfortunately, one of our compadres got it.  Oops.  Ah, Al.  Oh, absolutely incredible.  Dear, brilliant, as you guys are talking about it,  I'm watching the TV, waiting for the buildup.  I find myself jumping all over my living room, 
[150:00]
 like at the end of a Toyota commercial,  and I see Mark in the background.  And now I pretty much got to go change my drawers  because I pretty much peed myself and laughed so hard.  Absolutely incredible.  She was so bent.  Absolutely.  I know that she can't do a job.  Obviously, she has no sense of humor.  I could see her news editor just screaming at her.  But I got a psycho walk.  I'm glad that guy hustled you out of there, bro.  If I was working at Detail, I would have smuggled you out, too. 
[150:30]
 All right, Al.  That guy was like Harriet Tubman getting lost in the underground railroad.  Jeff?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  I got into an accident.  I'm so freaking much.  Oh, we're on cloud nine right now.  It's just the freaking funniest thing ever.  I know.  He's a freaking nut, man.  Yep.  This one puts Psycho Mark on the map, finally.  Yeah, I know. 
[151:00]
 All right, man.  All right, take it easy, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Here's another guy.  I'm one of the techies at CBS News Studio.  I saw what happened, fell on the floor laughing.  I almost got fired.  Hey, Greg, what's up?  Hey, listen, I used to intern for CBS in the OJ unit, and I also worked for Hillary once.  Yeah.  You guys should get Ziggy and Snoop and go back there when she leaves the studio.  That would be so funny to see that.  And then have her tell them what she's going to do for them if she makes it to be senator 
[151:30]
 in New York.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you.  You guys suck.  All right.  All right, man.  Bob?  That's Al.  Al, what's up?  Yeah, you know, this is going to make big quarks, one of them bloopers.  You guys are all right.  See, now, I guess we got to do what happened because when we saw the sign, we were freaking  out so much.  What was being said on the TV?  Was she like really distracted because you were yelling so loud, Mark?  I was behind her. 
[152:00]
 Oh, hold on, hold on.  I was behind her.  I didn't really get to see.  But you were shouting like a lion's tail.  I was screaming on top of my lungs.  I was yelling, forget the bullhorn.  I don't need a bullhorn.  See, that's what we need to find out now.  How did it look on TV?  But she said he was listening in the other room and he heard me screaming, you know,  whip them up, whip them up.  And she was off watching, you know.  She was just...  Her makeup was peeling off.  I keep looking back at the TV like it's still on.  I know.  I don't want to see it.  Well, they're going live again, but we were told to leave.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Likely.  You can't totally push it.  Go back where the sign says John 11.  Get that out of the way.  I'm going to go back to the TV.  I'm going to go back to the TV.  I'm going to go back to the TV.  I'm going to go back to the TV. 
[152:30]

You can call your C-word, everything.  She'll fix them all.  Oh, funny.  I want to see you guys get the best thing ever.  Alright.  Good luck to you.  Hey, thank you. 
[156:00]
 Thank you.  Bye.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Hey, dude, what's up?  What's up?  Dude, I swear, I broke my nose, man.  I broke my freaking nose.  I broke my freaking nose.  I broke my freaking nose.  I broke my freaking nose.  I broke my freaking nose trying to get to see this thing.  I'm listening to you guys and my TV's got crappy reception so I start running down the  hall to see it on the other TV.  I ran smack right down into the damn door jam.  My nose is broken, dude.  I'm going to the hospital now.  Alright, thanks, bro.  Alright, bro.  Take care.  How many people are we going to send to the hospital today from this bitch?  Another guy was there and says that Marsha's really pissed. 
[156:30]
 Chris.  Yo, how you doing, guys?  Alright.  Yo, Psycho Mark, man.  You know what it felt like when the Reagan got shot?  Remember when all those cops were jumping at one guy?  Dude, that was a trip, man.  Yo, guys, man, you know what?  I never knew these freaking news people put on so much freaking makeup.  Look at somebody went under with spackle.  Holy crap, man.  I couldn't believe that, man.  She was nasty looking, bro.  I shaved a dog's butt and it made it look better looking than that. 
[157:00]
 Yeah.  Very good, man.  Later, guys.  Alright, bye.  Instant feedback says Marsha just came back on and she looked mad as hell.  Yeah.  She's still pissed.  Risk.  I guarantee they're talking to somebody from CBS down the hall as we speak.  Guarantee it.  Just know this company like the back of my head at this point.  We're sorry.  Yeah, that'll help.  Pete.  Hello?  You're up, Pete.  What's up?  No, this is Danny.  You got the wrong name.  Alright, Danny. 
[157:30]
 They're calling me about the rock.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think you should send Psycho Mark over to WWF in the Continental Arena and talk about  the rock being a nigger.  Oh!  Oh my God.  Come on.  Pete.  We're all having fun and you gotta say that.  Geez, Jiminy Cricket.  The Garden Royal Rumble.  Yeah.  I think we have tickets.  Get you a huge sign.  Front row.  Front row.  Well, we're looking for signs, man.  Like we've seen some before, like every time WWF comes around, Continental or the Garden 
[158:00]
 Coliseum.  We see the signs, Opie and Anthony or ONA or Rusty Trombone.  We are looking.  Anybody that is going to any of those shows that are televised in this area, especially  the Royal Rumble, just bashing the rock signs.  Just bash the hell out of the rock with your signs.  We will have you on the next day.  Especially the Garden Show January 23rd. 
[158:30]
 Yep.  Because that's the big pay-per-view.  That'd just be hysterical.  The Rock's a pussy.  ONA, love the rock.  Yeah, you'll see that.  All right.  Rich, you're next on the show.  All right.  Hey, what's up?  Not much, man.  I was just sitting there going home on the LIE and bumping up on the traffic.  When that went down with Psycho Mark, about five cars around me started beeping their 
[159:00]
 horns.  The guy next to me was pounding on a dashboard.  I almost wet my pants.  I couldn't believe it, man.  I couldn't wait to get home, but I didn't make it in time.  Too bad.  It was too funny, man.  You guys rock.  All right, thank you.  All right, man.  I think the audio is just as funny, though.  We might have to replay that at the end of the show.  I want to hear that.  Because it was just unbelievable.  And of course, a good rock sign will be, hey, rock, steal or eat.  I think you know what we mean.  Oh, man.  I think we're just about done with this. 
[159:30]
 I think we have to take another break here.  You want to give those away?  All right, that'll change the subject.  Classic.  Mark, we bow to you today.  Yes, bravo.  It's lovely when we have one of those moments on this show.  Thank you.  We got some tickets to give away.  The Seton Hall basketball.  Seton Hall playing St. John's. 
[160:00]
 Very cool game at the Continental Arena on this Tuesday, January 18th.  On this Tuesday.  Whatever.  January 18th.  If you want to go see Seton Hall and St. John's at the Continental Arena, you could call up right now.  Spaz is working the phones.  He'll take the 10th caller.  212-757-1027.  Tickets for all Seton Hall games are available through Ticketmaster.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of pussies. 
[160:30]
 God, I want to punch you in the face.  Better leave a bruise.  1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW at Topia and Anthony.  What a day, what a day, what a day.  Yeah.  Line of the day.  Move to the left.  I guess we're losing Adam, huh?  Yeah, I got to go.  Adam's cutting out.  I got to go.  Where are you going, pal?  Where are you going?  I got to go do laundry.  I got stuff to do.  If you don't get there by 6.30, you don't get a dryer.  A big star like you.  You got to be going. 
[161:00]
 Going laundry.  You're coming out Thursday.  I want everything to be just so.  Yes.  Governors tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  And Sunday.  The incomparable Adam Ferrara.  Comedy, stylings, I think.  Yeah.  I think Adam wants to leave after that stunt we just pulled with CBS News.  He still wants that chance at Letterman.  He wants to get the hell out of the country.  You guys can yell all you want.  Aw.  We wrecked it.  That was so funny.  Yeah, that was good.  All right.  All right, Adam, we will be sure to catch up with you at Governors. 
[161:30]
 All right, good seeing you again.  You got me on the list, man.  I'm going to put you down.  You're a hell of a guy.  You want to sit ringside or you want to sit in the back and look at the bros?  Sit in the back.  You know, because it's like, I don't like being right up front.  I hate being in the front.  You get some smart-ass comic and then I got to unleash on him and it looks bad because  he's getting paid to be there and I'm not.  I'm tearing him a new able.  My God.  And it's going to be foot.  And Adam does work the front row pretty good.  No, I don't.  But Adam, I'm talking about the other comics that are on there.  Like, I know Adam wouldn't razz me or something.  The first thing I do, I swear to you, when I sit down and I am seated pretty close to  the stage, when a comic comes out, I look at him, the second he comes out and think  of at least three frigging barbs I could slam at this guy at any given moment.  So if he says anything to me, boom, I'm right back in two seconds, the crowd goes boom, 
[162:00]
 boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,  awesome channel for anyone who's ever seen it.  We'll do our full review at the channel and wish Chappell show a lot of you out  and make very sweet jokes.  funny no matter how stupid you are. It's not like a daytime strip bar, people can get hurt 
[162:30]
 in these jobs. Right. Alright Adam. Alright boys, thank you. Thank you. Always good seeing  you. Make it easy there buddy. Be a good champ. Anthony on the way, we're going to play the  Hillary and Chelsea go to Africa. A lot of people requesting it. Yeah I know. It's going  to be on Letterman tonight. It's juvenile humor at its best, that's on the way. And  Opie involved with that bit. Yeah. I actually. I actually did some voices for the radio show.  The voice of Chelsea Clinton. Played by Opie. Played by Opie. Thank you. Thank you very  much. In a stunning dual role, I was Mandingo and Hillary. Patty Duke. It's so juvenile. 
[163:00]
 It really is. It's third great humor at its best. If you've never heard it, stick around  for that. Also, we're going to attempt to replay the audio of Psycho Mark outside Letterman  Studio. Just got to get at least a piece of that because I got to hear that again. I was  just laughing. Yeah because we had no idea what we said, we were laughing so hard. Yeah.  In the meantime though, a quick musical break because we really got to regroup here, okay?  Alright. And we'll be back with that Hillary and Chelsea thing from Africa. Opie, what 
[163:30]
 is it going to take for us to pitch you off to the point where you're going to change  the station? That's what I need to know. Shove it. Anthony. Boy, it sure is easy to be a  fag on this show, isn't it? That's going to be trouble. Opie and Anthony. We just received  a Ph.D. in stupidity. 1027. WNEW. And yes, we are here. Getting a little nervous. We  have a couple of insiders that called us saying to tell us that there's a lot of crap  going down right now because of us and our show. Yeah. A lot of yelling and screaming. 
[164:00]
 A bunch of people want to know who we report to. That's never a good sign, Anthony. Oops.  Well. If you're just tuning in, you just missed some unbelievable stuff today. Yeah, it was  fun. My God. We're still in the middle of our radio show but now we're getting a little  nervous, Anthony. Just a bit. Not as much as April 1st, a couple of years ago. That's  true. We can't get fired over something like that, can we? I'm not saying anything. Okay. 
[164:30]
 Knock a little wood. Alan, you're next on the radio show. What's up? Hey, guys. How  you doing? All right. I was just watching the footage on Channel 2. They were showing  like the coming up stories at 6 o'clock. Yeah. They showed Hillary coming in and you  can hear Psycho Mark really clearly in the background yelling, show us your fun bags.  So you just got to watch out for that. I'm on the road right now but hopefully they'll  show it again tonight and maybe you'll catch it on the other channels too. All right. Cool. 
[165:00]
 Thank you. I'd like to, can I just say a shout out to my cousin Ash Man? You just did, man.  Thanks a lot. All right. Bye bye. Show us your fun bags. Did you hear that on the news  that was Psycho Mark. God darn. Oh, they're getting the audio from earlier on the show  so we can replay it before we get out of here at 7. Oh, good. We got to replay because I  got to hear what we were screaming because we were laughing so freaking hard. I know.  I got to hear a piece of that. Oh, man. We're going to play the Hillary and Chelsea thing 
[165:30]
 in a second here too. Yeah. Juvenile humor at its best. Oh, we've gotten plenty of requests  for it. Got to say some feedback, Shane. People seem to have really liked it. I just  hope management liked it. I'm sure. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We'll see. We'll see what happens.  We're one big happy family. Come on. John, what's up? Yeah. When is the Van Halen coming 
[166:00]
 on the radio? Automatic shuttle. Yes, the automatic, the button upstairs. You guys are  pushing the limits today. You're great. Yeah. Just when we thought it wouldn't get better  today that we just took it over the top. All right, John. Good luck, guys. See you. Bye.  A lot of people are a little paranoid now. John, what's up? Hey, what's up? We'll be  Anthony, big fan of the Bronco Bash. Remember? Oh, yeah. Yeah, you remember that? Of course,  yeah. Down there in Menaki. I'm going to say goodbye to you guys because I think this is 
[166:30]
 going to be a good one. Don't say that. I don't want to say it, but man, the First Lady  and all that? Good luck, guys. We didn't mess with her, really. Psycho Mark had a bullhorn  and when she arrived at the Letterman Studios, you could hear Clear's Day, Psycho Mark yelling,  show us your fun bags. Yeah, but they're always looking for a way to screw you guys. That's  true. I don't even know what to say. We cannot stay out of trouble. Well, at least I got  my Bronco Bash shirt signed by two guys I used to know from New York. Oh, my God. I 
[167:00]
 don't see that. Hey, guys. Good luck, man. All right. Bye. Good radio. All right. Bye.  I just hope the upper people thought it was good radio, Anthony. Maybe they're very busy.  We really did look for the other news stations. They just weren't around. No, that was the  first live shot. We were in place and we went. We really were trying to look for the Fox  News and the other ones, but they just weren't there. So once again, we picked on our own  team. Oh, boy. I'm getting nervous. I really am. All right. Let's play the Hillary and 
[167:30]
 Chelsea bit. Yeah, it's a favorite. It's juvenile human. Oh, that's best. Why not? It's in perfect  condition. Yeah. Hillary and Chelsea took a trip to Africa. Yeah. Can't confirm this,  but I believe we have some audio from their trip, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Of course we  All right. Let's go to the tape. Mom, are these people cannibals? No, no, Chelsea. Why would you say that? 
[168:00]
 Because the chief said he'd get anything to eat me. He sounds a lot like your father. Your mother,  Hillary, is very respected here. She has the one quality that is most coveted in our village.  What's that wisdom, compassion? No, a fat white ass. Well, your African name, Chelsea, is  keyala Abulafu. That's beautiful. What does it mean? Lanky pale girl with face of a one that. 
[168:30]
 Hey, mom, Ben Vigo wants me to go into the forest with him. I think he's gonna let me have one of  his tags. Why do you think that Chelsea? Because he said he's gonna give me his 12 inch you banging  black snake. Oh, it's beautiful out here. Man, bingo. By the way, what does your name mean?  It means man with three legs. Oh, really? Wow. Chelsea, when we are through tonight, 
[169:00]
 the whole village will call you. He was shall I can I? What does it mean? That means she who  cannot sit for weeks. Now grab your ankles, Chelsea, and I will demonstrate what your  father does to your countrymen. All right. So there's some audio in this, man. That's just  wrong. Look, we're still in the jungle. I know that well there's a part two. Of course there is. 
[169:30]
 There were so many unanswered questions in part one. It's like the godfather and the godfather  two more audio from Hillary and Chelsea visiting Africa. Oh, man. Dingo. It's so big. I need two  hands to hold it. Oh, that's it, Chelsea. Now wrap your lips around it. Yes, that's it. Now blow,  oh, 
[170:00]
 anytime, Chelsea, we best go back to the village and find your mother.  Oh, 
[170:30]
 no, no, I said before the day ends, I want to be deep in the bush. Well, you do what you want.  I'm going to help take care of a bad animal. What are you talking about? Chelsea, he wants me to  spank his monkey. Well, just be back in time for dinner. Okay. Well, what are we having?  I don't know about you, but I'll be having the African beaver.  Opie and Anthony. 1027 WNEW. 1027 WNEW. It's the Opie and Anthony show for now anyway. 
[171:00]
 We're trying to get the audio. We got to play the audio one last time before we get out of here.  Yeah. So I know we'll be told never to play it again. I'm sure. Let's go. The phone's real fast.  We're about to play. What do we learn on the Opie and Anthony show as well today? Celeste, what's up?  Hey, I was watching channel four and JD Danberg came on and was talking about Hillary Clinton 
[171:30]
 and her move to New York. They cut to her coming out of her car at the David Letterman show.  All you hear in the background is Mark saying, show me your... and then they cut back to the newsroom.  They cut off fun bags? Right. I guess I can't say fun bags. On Psycho Mark,  ask the first lady to show him her fun bags. Jesus, man. I'm just cracking up because I'm  trying to watch it on channel two and see if it comes on any other station. 
[172:00]
 All right, Celeste. Thank you. Thank you a lot. Bye.  I think we're all set with the audio too. Mike? Yo. What's up?  Let me tell you, ONA, you guys need a new job. I got something for you. I'm going to make sure  you guys are the best employed truck drivers in the county. You guys are out of your mind,  the thing in Africa. Get about it. What, you don't think they got the secret service?  They're coming after you. Yeah, we're going to have to leave the 
[172:30]
 back way today. I think so. I'm telling you, you guys are nuts.  Thank you, Mike. You're going to get the airport's  miles compared to that. How dare you say that about the first lady?  All right, Mike. You're going to be a truck driver.  Hang out with me, buddy. All right, man.  Thank you. All right.  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hang up on you. Taylor, what's up?  Taylor? Hey, guys.  Hey. Dude, you guys just put the nail on the  coffin. You guys didn't get in trouble for the wow sign. That last Chelsea bit was out of control. 
[173:00]
 Come on. I thought we were all having fun. What happened?  That really was their trip, right? We're not really sure, but we think so,  yeah. We think so?  Yeah. Okay. You guys rock.  All right, Taylor. Later, bro.  People love that bit. I think it's so juvenile. That's why it's funny. Come on.  Chris, what's up? What are you now, Mr. CBS-FM?  Yeah. What's up, Chris?  I actually listened to the other station, 1010 Winds, because in my office I got an FM radio,  but I only got an AM in my car. Don't ask. But I missed that whole thing because I couldn't 
[173:30]
 leave my office. Yeah, I missed that whole thing,  and that's what I get for leaving my office early. I could have dealt with my boss and  listened to the whole thing, but now I missed it.  All right. All right, man.  But keep rocking, dude. All right.  Well, let's play it now. What the hell? One last time before you throw it into the  ONA archives, Anthony.  Oh, boy.  This is a tape. It's not going on as we speak, but earlier,  Hillary Clinton showing up at David Letterman's studio. We had Psycho Mark out there just 
[174:00]
 causing all sorts of havoc.  Yeah, a little bit of trouble.  And then we told him to find a news station because he brought with him a huge, I mean,  huge wow sign. That obviously means whip him out Wednesday.  And Psycho Mark found the Channel 2 news crew.  Channel 2 news crew.  We work for the same company, idiot.  Don't say that too much. 
[174:30]
 So let's pick up the tape from about an hour ago. Psycho Mark outside the David Letterman  studio as we're trying to get our big wow sign on any TV station. This happened to be  the same one we were for. Here it is.  Oh, yeah. Mark.  Coming up, they said they're doing the Hillary piece.  Oh, they get a little tease.  Is the reporter right near you?  Yeah, the reporter. I didn't stand right behind her, dude.  All right. Don't let them onto you quite yet.  It's kind of too late. 
[175:00]
 Why?  She sort of spotted me.  Yeah, but they still have to go on, man.  Wow.  Who's asking you about your sign?  Oh, the reporter.  Ah, damn it. Don't worry about it. You have balls.  I do. I have huge balls.  Tell her it means wow because you're happy to be here. She doesn't know what it means.  Flip it over and have it say Hillary is a c.  They said no way. You guys will have to dump me.  All right. 
[175:30]
 Can I say hi to my mother?  I want to say hi to mom.  There you go.  All right.  Want to see if the reporter will wow us?  Uh, no, they're going to go to her any second.  Any second, man.  Yeah, any second.  We're out of the sign. We're going to hold it up high.  Yeah, we got to keep you on the line here.  We got to talk to Anthony on line seven.  His friend's in jail for threatening Hillary.  Really? What's the problem?  All right. I think they're ready to go.  We're going to hold that up high, man.  Almost ready. We got to synchronize. 
[176:00]
 All right. Date with Dave.  David Clark, Channel 2 News. Come on, Mark.  This is like interactive TV. Come on.  This is good. You get to screw with the TV and watch it at the same time.  Right.  This is what the future is like.  Oh, my God.  There he is.  It's a huge pass sign.  Move over. Move over.  Move over.  Move over. 
[176:30]
 What happened, Mark?  What happened, Mark?  Some CBS guy just jumped in front of you.  You look like a stock-raising lunatic.  That was classic, man.  Dude, it was hilarious.  They were like, move over. Move over. 
[177:00]
 Dude, are they going to go back to you?  The guy from the truck came over and ripped my side out of my head.  Come on.  Do your thing.  You're frigging lunatic, man.  That was hilarious, man.  They got to go back.  We're going back. What are you going to do when they come back?  You got the bullhorn, right?  I'm going to go to my box.  Oh, you got the bullhorn.  Bullhorn.  Say, uh.  Yeah, because the guy's about to punch my teeth out.  And we work for the same company.  Come on. We work for the same company.  They ought to know this is a cross promotion. 
[177:30]
 Oh, he is so mad.  He's trying to get into a rock and roll.  You were like screaming hysterical.  Dude, you're a pizzer.  It was hilarious.  I mean, we've got to explain this for everyone stuck in their car.  It's like Interactive TV.  We've got Channel 2 news on.  They go live outside Letterman Studio.  There's Mark with the hugest wow sign you'll ever see.  But all you see on TV is like half the O and the second W.  So we're like, move over, move over. 
[178:00]
 Oh, here he is.  Where are you, Mark?  Where are you, Mark?  They're back to you.  I got some reinforcements at least.  Get behind her.  Get behind her.  They're back live.  Are they back on?  Yeah.  There you go.  There's the wow sign again.  Higher.  Chance, whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Move to the side. 
[178:30]
 Move to the side real fast.  Move to the side.  Move over.  Move over.  God damn it.  That's the funniest thing.  Hold on a second, Mark.  Hold on.  Hold on a second, Mark.  But she's in the studio from the radio.  I'm listening to you guys, but I'm listening to the TV at the same time.  She's standing there and Anthony says, say, whip them out.  So they're yelling, whip them out.  She's trying to do the rest of the report. 
[179:00]
 So as she's closing the report, she looks back and she says,  as you can hear, it's getting loud out here.  We're calling the police.  They can't call the police.  Hey, Mark.  That was hilarious.  Well done.  Bravo, Mark.  Now that's interactive television right there.  She's not very happy.  Who's not happy?  Marcia Clayworth.  She's very mad at me.  You tell her go to our boss. 
[179:30]
 No, I'm not.  I'm just hanging out.  The thing is, you should be allowed to do your job.  I should be allowed to do mine.  Oh, we're giving it all up there.  Come on.  That's his job.  He is doing his job.  That's his job.  No, it was fine.  I have another live shot to do.  You either let me do it or I'm going to call the police.  All right.  That sounds good.  Oh, come on.  You can't threaten the cops.  That was fine.  We've got the cops here.  We're friends with them.  Hey, Mark.  Mark, I hear a dare.  I think she's daring you.  All right. 
[180:00]
 I'll go bother Fox.  All right.  Is there CBS on there too?  Yeah, why don't you go bother them?  Oh, there's CBS as well?  Yeah.  All right.  I'll go bother them.  All right.  Tell her she got a ton of free advertising right there.  You guys have so much free advertising.  That's unbelievable.  Oh, she is mad.  She is not happy.  I bet.  What a face on her.  All right.  Mark, hold on the line, all right?  Yeah.  Talk to him.  Make sure nothing's going on.  There's so many people that saw it on TV.  Paula, what's going on?  I just saw that damn stuff just now, and my god. 
[180:30]
 She actually set the martial clock.  Oh, wow.  We're neighbors.  I bought a cup of sugar.  No, Hillary wants to give your hubby a hummer.  You have heard of those, have you?  Oh, boy.  She's a lunatic.  James, you're next on the program.  What's up?  I'm so pissed at you guys.  I'm driving in my car, and I cannot see this.  You better put it on your website.  You have to put it on your website.  Oh, this is scary.  Yeah, hopefully someone's got to copy that. 
[181:00]
 We didn't think it was going to happen today.  So oh, my god.  I hope they showed on the news or something.  That's the highlight.  Forget Hillary.  All right.  It's the highlight.  All right, James.  Thank you.  See, some guy on the instant feedback said the delay really screws with you when you're  watching at home because it's a 40-second delay from when we're talking to when they're  watching on TV.  So we're saying move over, move over.  And it's already over.  And yeah.  Oh, it was complete interactive.  You got to link up our audio with that video.  You know what I like about interactive TV?  We're not waiting.  We'll make it ourselves. 
[181:30]
 Andrew.  Yeah.  What's up?  Guys, I'm watching on TV, and I'm listening to the radio at the same time.  What the last guy said is totally true.  It's the funniest damn thing because I hear, I see Mark making a total ass out of something.  His tongue hanging out of his mouth.  And you guys are like, all right, they're going to cut you real soon.  Then they cut away and go to the interview.  And I hear you guys scream, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Funniest damn thing I've ever seen.  Oh, god.  Thank you, Andrew.  All right, take care. 
[182:00]
 All right, well, there you go.  That's from an hour ago, Anthony.  Jesus.  That was hilarious.  Cracking up.  Hope people in our company can take a joke at it.  I'm sure they can.  All right, listen.  We're going to take a quick break.  And then we're going to play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony  show today.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Throw men jumping all over each other.  OK, terrific. 
[182:30]
 One O-Two-Seven, W-N-E-W.  One O-Two-Seven, W-N-E-W.  It's Opie and Anthony.  What a show.  What a show today.  Wow.  I don't think anyone turned off their radio.  Oh, no.  From two o'clock on today.  Huge.  Just an absolute huge radio show.  And if it's our last.  Oh, don't say that, please.  That's how I heard that it was.  So, please.  All right.  OK.  I got to be upbeat here.  What a way to go out though, huh? 
[183:00]
 I don't want to go all those job searching again.  There's those interviews, the flights all over the hell's creation.  Come on.  No.  All right, let's play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie  and Anthony show today.  And we'll get the hell out of here, hopefully.  Hey, Chris.  Chris, you're first.  What did you learn on the show today?  What's going on?  How are you doing?  How are you?  We'll see.  I learned that Psycho Mars got the biggest pair of balls 
[183:30]
 inside of a freaking Manhattan Bay Bay.  Yes.  Absolutely.  All right.  Oh, please, and please.  I got to go to work.  Peace.  All right, man.  Matt, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Hey, Matt.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up?  I learned that interactive TV is a lot better than a nigger trolley movie.  Yeah.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  See you later.  All right, bye. 
[184:00]
 Vanjie, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Hi, how are you doing, guys?  If they would give out Oscars for radio shows, you would win, no doubt.  I mean, you guys are just too much.  You are so on the money.  I mean, I missed it.  You know, I just heard the last part.  I didn't see the television part.  It didn't matter what part you saw.  If you were just home and you're in an opiate-anthetic show  and you just happened to be watching news, you didn't have the radio show on,  it's funny that way.  Oh, no, I didn't.  If you're just watching and listening to the radio show in your car, it's funny that way.  But if you're fortunate enough to have the radio and the TV on at the same time, 
[184:30]
 multi-media.  Forget about it.  Oh, God.  All right, Vanjie.  I'm so sorry.  I missed it.  I'm going to watch the news tonight, though.  All right, cool.  Happy New Year to you guys.  You, too.  Bye.  Bye.  Nice.  Joey, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Hello?  Yeah, you're next, Joey.  Let's go.  What's up?  I learned to stay away from 98-pound brown-eyed girls with eating fetishes.  That goes back to the beginning of the show.  Great show, guys.  If it's your last one, you won out with a bang.  All right. 
[185:00]
 I love you.  All right.  Thank you, Joey.  Take it easy, buddies.  Yeah, please don't say that.  We got to stay positive here.  Christian, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  All right.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that history always repeats itself.  Boston and New York.  I don't say that.  Oh, man.  Don't say that.  We're just trying to entertain.  And bolt wounds should not affect strippers.  Huh?  And bolt wounds should not affect strippers.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Don't even say that.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  I learned today that starting tomorrow, 
[185:30]
 the Opie and Anthony show is going to be replaced with the Black Earl and Nigger Charlie show.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on, man.  I got more watch for you.  Send Steve the video.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey.  Hey, I'm his brother.  You guys suck.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Mike, what did you learn on the show today?  I had a great show, guys.  Laughing our tails off today.  Couldn't get any work done.  Oh, cool.  But I learned that Marcia Kramer has no sense of humor,  and she must really think she's all freaking important.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks. 
[186:00]
 Bye.  Paul, you're next.  Hello.  Hey, fellas.  Congratulations.  I'll be coming the kings of all media.  Yeah, right.  I want to say that I  basically learned to find a woman that refuses to cook.  Definitely.  So you don't have to spend $700 on seven pots.  That's right.  All right.  Very good.  Take it easy, fellas.  All right.  Chris, you're next.  Me?  Yeah.  Yo, how you doing?  All right.  Guys, awesome show tonight.  Thanks.  Listen, I learned that George Foreman Grill is a good wedding present. 
[186:30]
 Very good.  Thank you, guys.  Have a good one.  Bye.  Eddie.  Yeah.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that, Opie, you better have a real big house to house Anthony and Rick and his wife now.  And I also learned that maybe you guys are going to get nationwide coverage  if they show that clip on all the affiliates that they have.  I don't think they will.  Yeah, I don't either.  Thank you, Eddie.  All right.  Bye.  Bye. 
[187:00]
 Oh, no.  Now I'm getting a little nervous.  I need a beer.  Wayne.  How you doing?  I don't think you guys are going anywhere.  I think your radio show will be here for good.  Oh, cool.  I hope so.  But I wanted to say that I learned if you're a stripper, you better, you know, be nice to your boyfriend  so you won't get shot in the ass.  Very good.  We did learn that today.  Yeah.  All right.  Take care.  And did it and I say that we love CBS.  Yes.  Welcome home.  Welcome home, everybody.  Absolutely.  Yes.  We love CBS. 
[187:30]
 Don't forget to tune in David Letterman tonight for the Hillary Clinton interview.  Yes.  Everybody in town talking about it.  What a coup that was.  What a coup.  All right, Dave.  You know, Jay didn't get that.  Over there on that crappy NBC network.  Yeah, we're not big NBC fans whatsoever.  CBS.  And if anyone, any bigwigs are listening, we don't like Q104.  We don't like TLJ.  We don't like C-100.  No.  We want rock.  We want to stay right here.  Right now, tune in to Kane on K-Rock. 
[188:00]
 Ted, what's up?  Yo, don't be in agony.  Yeah.  I call you guys don't be in agony because you're going to lose your jobs over a rack  that nobody wants to see in the first place.  Oh, no.  You better not.  I'm just kidding, man.  I love you guys.  All right, man.  Be good.  Bye.  Oh, Vic, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, Vic.  Yeah, I missed the whole show today.  Oh, boy.  We keep telling you guys, you know, some days it's kind of boring and a little slow,  but you can't turn off this radio show.  You don't know what you're going to miss.  You never know.  Yeah.  All right.  Guys, listen, could I come down there punch that right in the mouth? 
[188:30]
 Okay.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  When can I come down there?  Tomorrow.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  You know what the show's like?  You remember Jenny Cam on the web?  Yeah.  Where you tune it in, and usually it was a picture of Jenny's empty bed  or some clothing, a pile of clothing on the floor.  Sure.  Or something, or a fleeting glimpse of a hand passing by the camera.  Oh, yeah.  And then every so often, there was Jenny, spread eagle, naked on the bed.  That's our show.  That's it. 
[189:00]
 You never know when it's going to be spread eagle on the bed.  Sometimes you got to sit through a pile of laundry to get to the nudity.  All right, Chris.  It's a great show today.  I learned that today is your final show in New York.  Oh, stop it.  Good luck to you and find a new job.  All right, boy?  All right.  Take care.  Thanks.  You guys, that's not even a joke because we've been through this already.  You know, if we hadn't been through it, I'd be joking, but we've been through it.  It sucks, and I don't want to deal with it again.  We did this exact same thing where we had an outrageous stunt,  and everyone's calling up going, well, that was a great last show, guys. 
[189:30]
 Thanks.  Ha ha, yeah.  Just want to wish you luck in whatever you do next, and we're all laughing like, shut up.  We're going to get fired with the number one show in Boston.  It was our last show, so that's why we're not even laughing at it today.  Jay, what's up?  I want to be the last one to say you guys suck.  And I just want to let you know that you guys need to be touched by an angel  if you want to stay on the air.  All right, man.  Thank you, Jay.  We'll finish with old dirty.  Old dirty.  Bravo. 
[190:00]
 Bravo.  Oh, you guys did my 40, bro.  You spilled your 40 over there.  I spilled my 40 too, Jay.  Perfect freaking timing, my man.  I know.  My hat's off to you, my brother.  Oh, my goodness.  We'll be hanging out with you.  We'll be left with you in no time.  Yeah, right.  You're going to start laughing, right?  Yeah, listen to me.  I got to go to the mill.  Listen.  Yeah.  You know what I learned today?  That the next house I'll rock, I got to spill some pots.  That's the way all the money goes. 
[190:30]
 Old dirty, I got to cut you off.  We got to get out of here on time.  All right, baby.  All right.  Peace.  And with that, we'll see you guys tomorrow, hopefully.  All right?  OK.  It's going to be a long walk down that hall right now.  Yeah, it is.  I know.  Because you know what's at the end of the hall, don't you?  Yes, I do.  Do you guys have a moment?  You got a minute?  You want to come in here?  Got a minute?  Boy, they liked us for how long?  A week.  All right, man.  Thanks for listening. 
[191:00]
 Too stupid.  Oh, Opie.  You know how much money I'm making to suck this bad?  You little freak.  Anthony.  I find you repulsive.  Huh.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW. </pre>
