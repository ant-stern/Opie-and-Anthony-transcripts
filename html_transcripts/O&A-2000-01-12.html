<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with comedian Stephen Lynch in studio.  A significant portion of the show revolved around listener Rick, whose wife spent $600 on seven pots, sparking a humorous debate amongst callers, including Rick’s wife, and the hosts, who jokingly (and incorrectly) claimed to have given Rick a George Foreman grill as a wedding gift. This transitioned into a call from Dan, who detailed a bizarre story about a former girlfriend’s fetish for watching him overeat, leading to extreme weight gain and a court-mandated double food ration in jail.  The segment concluded with discussion of Adam Ferrara’s appearance on the show and his recent cancellation from David Letterman, interspersed with listener calls and tangents about daytime strippers and Ferrara’s musical past.

The show continued with a heavy focus on listener-submitted anecdotes about strip clubs. Callers Frank, Joe, and Bob shared outrageous and often crude stories, including descriptions of dancers using beer bottles and bodily fluids as projectiles, a stripper with a deformed foot, and a topless deli with a dancer in the back.  These stories detailed questionable hygiene, unique performances, and humorous observations about both dancers and patrons. One caller recounted a college tradition involving a strip club buffet where attendees shielded their plates from the dancers.  Another described a peach schnapps-fueled night ending in ejection from a strip club.  Further calls continued the theme, detailing unusual encounters and exorbitant prices at various Long Island and New Jersey strip clubs.  A caller also recounted a bizarre go-go dancer audition featuring a 50-year-old woman whose performance ended abruptly.  A retired cop, John, described "tuning up" suspects in the 1970s.

Adam Ferrara remained in studio, and the hosts discussed Hillary Clinton's upcoming appearance on David Letterman, speculating on potential awkwardness or humor.  A commercial break for "Stacker 2" fat burner followed, with humorous commentary linking weight loss to stripper income.  The hosts and Ferrara discussed their own past experiences, including Opie and Anthony's old apartment and their landlord, and a trip to Atlantic City.  The discussion continued to circulate back to listener calls about strip clubs, before transitioning to Psycho Mark's stunt outside the David Letterman studio where Hillary Clinton was a guest.  Mark, with a bullhorn and a large sign reading "WOW" (intended to mean "Whip Him Out Wednesday"), engaged in attention-grabbing behavior with Secret Service and news crews, as caught on live television.  The show also included a trailer for the blaxploitation film "The Soul of Nigger Charlie" and a clip of a couple having sex at a baseball game.


A significant portion of the show focused on Psycho Mark's stunt orchestrated by Opie and Anthony, where he disrupted a CBS news broadcast outside the Letterman studio. The hosts played a comedic audio bit about a fictional Hillary and Chelsea Clinton African trip and discussed the potential consequences of the stunt.  Numerous callers reacted to the stunt, with some describing near-injuries while rushing to see it on TV and others recounting the chaos in the CBS control room.  Callers made racial slurs and other offensive comments throughout this segment.  The show included a "What Did We Learn?" segment where callers offered their takeaways, ranging from advice on finding a non-cooking woman to warnings about strippers and their boyfriends.  A caller's brother phoned to insult the hosts, and other callers joked about the show potentially being their last. One caller, "Old Dirty,"  joked about robbing houses and stealing pots. The unpredictable nature of the show was compared to the Jenny Cam website. The hosts also expressed their dislike for several competing radio stations (Q104, PLJ, C-100, K-Rock) while praising CBS and David Letterman's interview with Hillary Clinton.  The broadcast concluded with the hosts anticipating a potential confrontation with their superiors. A caller recounted a chaotic casino gambling night with Joe Buck.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony. We punish ignorance.  Hey, Ass, turn down your radio.  1027 WNEW.  Alright, it's FM Talk at 1027.  It's Opie and Anthony and Stephen Lynch in the studio.  This music's too loud. Sorry about that.  Yeah. I've heard from people, too, like the music that's playing when we come out of a break.  Yeah.  It'll be loud in our phones.  Right. So we sound like we're yelling over the music, but it's all equalized going out of the radio. 
[00:00:30]  So sometimes it sounds like, hey, how you doing? It's Opie and Anthony.  Well, we're back.  Oh, my ears are bleeding.  Oh, my God.  Alright.  Rick was telling a cute little story while we were in a commercial break.  Yeah.  How long have you been married, Rick?  I believe you're up to 10 days.  T plus 10 days.  No.  10 days back from your honeymoon, a day and a half.  In an hour, it'll be 12 days total. 
[00:01:00]  All right.  Okay.  So 12 days, a dozen days.  Dozen days.  Now, Rick, you did quite well with the wedding checks, I believe.  We did okay, but it wasn't about money.  No.  Yeah, but, I mean, let's face it.  When you get married, you get very excited to open up those envelopes.  You do get a little giddy, don't you there, Rick?  Just a little bit.  That sack is in front of you, and you're just kind of opening up envelopes going, ooh, look at this one.  Yeah.  Like, I don't even like these people.  So, you're sitting there and thinking of all the fine things you could buy with the money, right? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Right?  And you're sitting there going, wow, look at all this money.  I could buy that.  Especially, you know, all the work I did the past year.  Sure, sure.  The extra hours I put in.  So, Rick, how long did it take before you realized you would have no say in how the money was spent?  Well, it hit me on the 11th day.  11th day, which was yesterday.  About 8 p.m.  Some of the money was spent yesterday? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  How much money was spent yesterday?  I came home, and I found...  Wait, wait, wait.  No, just how much money did she spend yesterday?  She spent...  That's all I want to know right now.  600 bucks?  600 bucks.  Okay.  $600.  Okay.  Now, I'm thinking...  I've got some good stuff.  That's a major purchase.  Probably, I'm guessing, either major appliance, something like that, to make the little woman's life a little easier around the homestead, right?  All right, kids, hold on to your steering wheel really tight.  So, what did she spend the money on, Rick? 
[00:02:30]  Well, um...  We had registered for some things that we never got.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Just get to it.  Go.  She bought pots.  Come on!  Are you kidding me?  No.  She bought pots.  Now, $600...  $600...  $600 worth of pots.  Pots.  Well, I'm thinking you must get a hell of a lot of pots. 
[00:03:00]  That's what I said.  That's a load.  For $600.  Yeah.  You sure she said she spent it on pots and not pot?  Yeah, there were no, like, you know, bags around the house.  All right.  All right.  This is old shit.  It's on the marijuana.  All right.  $600 on pots.  Yes.  So, now I'm thinking probably a pot for any occasion.  Hundreds of pots could be bought for $600. 
[00:03:30]  I am dead.  How many pots were purchased for $600?  Seven pots.  Does George Foreman come to your house, too, and cook for that price?  Actually, we got that.  The George Foreman lean, mean, fat-burning, grilling machine.  And we got it from you and Jen.  George...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, sure. 
[00:04:00]  All right, hold on.  Pete, what's up?  No way.  I gave you a check, you bastard.  I gave you cash.  Did you?  I know I did.  You didn't...  Get out of here.  The day I give you a goddamn grilling machine, put it over my freaking head.  We got the George Foreman fat-busting grill from you.  No.  Look.  Asswipe.  Look.  There is no way in hell.  You got the George Foreman grilling, fat-burning machine from us. 
[00:04:30]  We did.  Dude, look, I'm pissed now.  I wrote a freaking check for you, man.  Cash.  I understand that.  I got out of the car with no wrapped gift or anything.  Right.  It was an envelope with a check in it.  You seem to have crossed up some of your labeling on gifts that were given out, unless Opie was playing a joke on me.  We got the grilling machine and slapped our name on it. 
[00:05:00]  Dude, you mean you went 12 days thinking I gave you a goddamn George Foreman grilling machine?  Linda, if you're listening, Rick's wife, if you're listening, there's no way we got you a George Foreman grilling machine.  You're joking with me, right?  No, I'm not joking, dude.  Rick, I swear to you.  I swear to Christ to you.  And the funniest part about it, dude, we were psyched. 
[00:05:30]  You're like, cool.  Because I don't care how psyched you are.  We did not get you a grilling machine.  A frigging infomercial product.  I get our producer for his wedding?  Dude, I cut you a pretty good check.  Find it.  You could buy another half a pot with that money.  You could get at least another two or three pots.  Yeah.  I am going to frigging faint.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:06:00]  You've been thinking that we got you that?  Probably mocking you.  Oh, my God.  You got us a frigging infomercial thing.  Where's the time master from Opie and Sandy?  Actually, we were expecting the slam, man.  Rick, I swear to you.  No.  There was no George Foreman grilling machine.  Are you sure it wasn't you?  Positive.  I could have sworn it was you, man.  Positive.  Holy mother of pearls.  Hey, I am livid. 
[00:06:30]  Cheryl, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  I'm thinking that maybe Jen gave that as a bridal shower gift.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That could have been it.  All right.  Well, a bridal shower gift.  That's fine.  But it still came from you.  Not a wedding.  It had your name on it, though.  It did not.  It did.  A bridal shower gift?  With a lingerie.  Nothing better for George, George, George, George, and George.  And Rick and Linda.  And showing he cares about our producer, Rick.  Come on.  Uh-oh.  Hey, Pete, what's going on? 
[00:07:00]  Hey, where's Rick?  Is he there?  I'm right here.  What are you, half a fag or something like that?  Everyone's a fag.  At least I'm half a fag.  What?  What do I do now?  When you take a piss, pal, what are you doing giving your wife any money at all?  That's a box, I bought it, Ben.  You're crazy.  Get your penis at the door, pal.  You don't need it anymore.  See?  I think he's more pissed than I am.  Eric, what's going on?  Listen, man.  That's enough for the grilling machine, man.  It's all gay.  Get him up to the house, apologize, and that's what I'm doing. 
[00:07:30]  That wasn't his wedding gift.  I was going to say, that's a great gift in the black community at a wedding, right?  Absolutely, man.  I got married.  I could cook up my crack in that.  I got like 50 sets of towels, man.  So, like, I've been married now 12 years.  I've still got towels.  I haven't even freaking used it yet.  All right, Eric.  Very good.  Watch the difference between guys and girls.  Let me put a lady on the phone here. 
[00:08:00]  Michelle, what's going on?  Oh, I knew you were coming for me when I heard that.  What's up, Michelle?  That's reasonable if it's a good set of pans.  $600 is a reasonable price for seven pots?  Think about it.  Think about it.  If you're going to buy a set now for $150 or whatever, and then three years from now,  buy another set, and three years from now, buy another set.  That's the logic of the ladies.  This was the logic I got last night.  Of course.  This will last us 10 to 15 years.  12 years.  What kind of pots are they?  I don't know.  They're pots. 
[00:08:30]  My mother has pots in her house that I swear I remember her cooking me soupy when I was  six, when I was a kid.  Same pots.  And they probably cost like $10.  Pots.  $600 on seven pots.  Phil, what's up?  This might not be a bad thing for Rick.  The key question is, Rick, if you came home with, say, a $600 stereo receiver, would you  get the shit beat out of you, or would that be cool?  Because if it works both ways, you could work this to your advantage. 
[00:09:00]  No, I'm not going to be spending $600.  I won't get clearance on that.  Clearance.  Clearance.  It's all over for the client.  You've got no chance.  If she can go and drop six, and you don't have a peep to say about it, and if you did the  same thing you're host, it's, you know, just turn over everything.  Thank you, Phil.  Let's see.  Here's what led to the $600 pot story.  Here we go.  Okay.  We're flying back from Aruba, and she said, you know, one of the things I wanted us to 
[00:09:30]  get that we didn't get for the wedding were these sets of pots that I registered.  Planting the seed on the way home.  Look at that.  So here.  Planting the little seed.  Yeah, after a week's longest sex, I figure, you know.  So, she goes, she goes, they're like $300, $350 bucks, the ones she registered for.  Well, that was 10 months ago.  That set is not available anymore at Williams-Sonoma.  Huh?  So, it's their fault, Rick?  So, now it's the $600 set of pots. 
[00:10:00]  Are you, are you, are you defending her by saying the store screwed up by not having them?  No, this is how I got suckered in.  So, then when I got home, and I'm, and she goes, um, I got you this, and I got you this,  and I got you Tostitos, and I got you little weenies, and I got you this.  Like, she bought me all these, like, little food.  And I got $600 worth of pots.  Right.  Exactly.  Trying to run it past you.  Exactly.  And it was just like, and, um, it's like she's softening the blow.  Like, and I got the pots.  I'm like, oh, cool.  How much was the final total?  Oh, $600.  Well, they didn't have the ones I registered for. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  And you said I could go and get them.  So, well, $600.  You think you know what you'd do?  You'd come home someday and go, look, they didn't have the Sony Walkman I wanted,  so I had to get the big screen digital television set.  Yeah, I had to get the big screen TV.  Uh, Jay, what do you have to add?  Is Rick, by chance, short for Richard?  No, it's not.  Ah, I was going to say, there's another nickname for Richard that sounds like Rick, 
[00:11:00]  and I think you're going to have to start bawling yourself out for a while.  If we're trying to tell you, don't get married.  We spent weeks trying to tell you, don't get married.  Oh, my God.  I was going to say what Anthony said.  Why don't you walk out and just try to buy a TV, like a 32-inch stereo TV.  See what happens.  I already got one of those, and she was there for it.  Okay, well, buy one for your room, though, just for you, like, to watch football games on the weekend.  That goes in your room, and then you get the big screen TV. 
[00:11:30]  I'm talking the, like, 56-inch.  We don't have the room, dude.  Who cares?  Buy it.  It's not a matter of even watching it.  You never have to turn it on.  You just have to purchase it.  That's it.  In the hallway.  That's it.  A doorstop.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  I'll tell you.  I'm listening to you guys, and I'll tell you, Rick's actually lucky,  because at least he's got something sizable to show for $600.  My brother's witch of a wife just spent $600 on six steak knives.  Six steak knives. 
[00:12:00]  $100 a night.  One set of Hankle steak knives for $600.  I could appreciate a purchase laptop.  I don't know what's funnier.  By the way, Rick, did you get the George Foreman grill that I did?  I don't know what's funnier.  Rick's wife spending $600 on pots,  or Anthony finding out that he gave the George Foreman grill as a wedding gift.  I did not.  You did.  It wasn't a wedding gift.  Your name was on it.  I don't know whether it was given to you as a bridal shower gift, 
[00:12:30]  or given to Linda as a bridal shower gift.  That was not your wedding present from us.  It was not the George Foreman fat burning grilling machine thing that he sells.  Hey, George, what's up?  I want to ask Anthony, when you ordered the George Foreman grill machine,  are you making four easy payments on that, or did you pay it all at once?  What's the matter with you?  Now, four easy payments.  Did you throw in a Mark McGuire rookie card? 
[00:13:00]  Be dialing people.  George Foreman grill.  Look at the fat it burns off.  And you get a social rookie card and a Beanie Baby.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, you guys got to play back all those days where we told Rick not to get married.  He was sounding so pompous and all full of himself.  Now he sounds like a beaten dog.  Oh, I'm not that beaten. 
[00:13:30]  I still got my car.  Oh, your little yellow sports car?  Yeah, hopefully that'll be home when I get home.  Rick still has his little yellow sports car.  How long, we'll take a little pool here,  how long before it's traded in for an Astrovan?  Huh?  How long before the Dodge Caravan's in the driveway  and your little yellow sports car,  the impractical two-seater,  is gonzo.  God, I hope it's home when I get home.  Andrea.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up?  Rick, how many pots did you say you got in? 
[00:14:00]  I got seven pots.  Are you sure?  Is it a set of seven?  I guess so, yeah.  Why?  Because if it's a set of seven,  you know what you're paying for.  You're paying for three pots,  maybe a pan,  and three lids.  Oh, they count the lids  on the part of the set?  No, we definitely got seven pots  out of the deal.  Are you sure about that?  Oh, well, then you didn't get ripped off.  No.  And for an extra hundred,  we'll throw in handles.  I'm doubting this.  Yeah, it's a 20-piece set.  Well, we include the screws  that hold the handles on,  the washers, everything. 
[00:14:30]  Pots not included.  Rick, I want to know,  I've got to come over someday  and have maybe some,  maybe some Campbell's tomato soup  cooked in an almost $100 pot.  It's got to be good.  And then it's got to taste better  than, like, just a regular old pot.  And then we can grill you up  a nice grilled cheese sandwich  in your George Foreman  fat-buffin grill, man.  It'll be a nice soup  and sandwich for you.  Oh, good.  If we have to run out 
[00:15:00]  for any groceries,  you can take me  in your Dodge Caravan.  We'll pass your sports car  at the lot  where it was traded in  for your Astrovan.  You know, I feel so free.  I think I'm going to go out tonight  and spend $600  in hookers and drugs.  Just because I can.  Cutting down tonight?  We found a girl  that can shoot stuff  from a private area.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:15:30]  So, it's Dan.  Hey.  It's Dan Farrar  sitting in on the program today.  Sure.  Anthony, I'm the one.  We've got this great guy  with the strange and wild story.  All right.  Yeah, let's hear this.  Hey, Rick.  Yep.  It's Opie and Anthony  and Adam Farrar.  How are you today?  How are you guys doing?  Hey, what's up, man?  We obviously got you live  on the radio here  in New York City.  Yes, I am.  And I hear you've got  a very unusual story to tell.  Yeah, it's a little different.  All right.  Definitely a little different. 
[00:16:00]  Well, I guess it goes back  to 1979.  You met this girl, right?  Yeah, I met this girl.  Actually, she met me.  She had seen me, you know,  around town and liked me  because I was a large guy anyway.  I was 6'4", 240.  6'4", 240 back in 1979.  Big guy.  Just out of high school,  four years of football,  all that good stuff.  All right.  And 20 years later,  how much do you weigh?  Right now, I'm 5'37".  I topped out in 1989  at about 850. 
[00:16:30]  Sell!  Sell!  Sell!  Yeah, get rid of it all.  And obviously,  this girl has something to do  with your drastic weight gain.  Yeah, she did.  Very much so.  She had a fetish  of what I'm finding out  seems to be  what is called  these feeder people  or whatever.  And she sexually got stimulated  whenever she would  watch me eat food.  Wow.  Yeah.  It was to the point  of where I could sit down, 
[00:17:00]  eat a piece of cake  after dinner  or something like that.  And she would just  be all excited  and I would just  have to finish the job.  Was she a big girl?  She was a whopping 98 pounds.  Oh, wow.  So she's a rail.  Soaking wet.  Wow.  You guys made the number 10  when you stood next to each other.  Just about.  Well, yeah, later on.  All right.  So did you know  she had this fetish  when you met her?  No, I had no idea.  No clue?  So what was your first clue?  How long did it take?  Right.  Well, my first clue 
[00:17:30]  of it really getting  to the point of,  oh my God,  what the hell  am I going to do with this?  Was I had gotten  in a little trouble  with some marijuana  before I had met her?  Sure.  Weed.  That's how it starts.  That's what makes you hungry.  Grass.  Weed.  That was part of it,  but hey,  it was California in the 70s.  Mary Jane.  Before you know it,  you're doing Benny's,  Dexys.  Yeah.  I bet you think  you're pretty cool  and far out,  don't you?  The next step  is Entenmann's cake  and you're moving  the bed into the kitchen. 
[00:18:00]  Then we just started  sleeping in a grocery store.  All right.  So tell us the first clue.  Go ahead.  You said you got  in trouble for drugs,  right?  I got sentenced  to a couple of months  in jail,  L.A.  County Jail.  And I found out  that she had gone  to the judge,  I believe the one  that sentenced me,  and told him  that her mental state  welfare and all  that good stuff  was dependent upon  the fact that  I stayed large.  I was up to about,  oh,  350,  maybe 400  at this time.  Right.  And she was afraid  of going in there 
[00:18:30]  eating that sort of food.  I was going to lose  a lot of weight.  This judge gave  a court order to her  that ordered me  to receive double  portions of food  inside the bed.  Come on.  That's the Oprah bill.  Nice word.  It's documented  court documents  to prove it all.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  So you're in jail  for a while.  Yes.  And you're still  packing on pounds.  No, because I just  refused to do it.  I'm not stupid.  It's, you know,  the food was crap,  so you're not going  to eat double portions  of crap.  So now how was she? 
[00:19:00]  Were there any other  inmates that liked  to watch you eat?  Bubba.  Yeah, his name was no.  So how'd she get turned on  if you're in jail?  Oh, she didn't.  Actually, there was  a couple of incidences  where she would come  to the visiting room.  Yeah.  She had arranged  for a private visit,  which was still  through the glass.  Right.  And I would sit there  and I had eaten,  I had saved a couple  candy bars that I had  bought at the store. 
[00:19:30]  I sat there and ate them  on one side of the glass  and she was in an overcoat  doing her thing.  God bless you.  Let me ask you something.  Were the guards  like that scene  in Goodfellas?  Come right this way.  Come right in.  Don't I sign right in here?  Come this way, Mrs. Hill.  It's the girl with the coat.  Come on, come this way.  Wow.  You must have been  the king after that.  This only happened one time.  Oh.  That only happened once in jail?  Yeah, that did only happen once.  All right, so after you  got out of jail,  what happened when you guys  were living together and stuff?  Well, you know,  it seemed like she got 
[00:20:00]  more of a fever pitch  for this whole thing.  It was like she doubled  her efforts to make me large.  And I was caught in the trap  of where I was doing  what I wanted,  eating good food  and having great sex.  Well, how turned on  would she get  as she watched you eat?  All I could tell you  is you just had to watch it.  I mean, you just had to see it.  It was to wear moisture.  You know, I mean,  I don't know what other  way to put it.  So she was like,  yeah, really turned on.  Oh, yes.  And what was she like,  a dynamo?  Like really a... 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, she was a little  98-pound person  and you spin her  like a helicopter.  You know, spin her  like a top.  Would she scream out  foods in the middle  of her orgasms?  No.  You know, it never got  to the nine and a half  weeks kind of thing.  Right.  I kind of wish it did  once in a while.  But no, it did never  go that way.  It was never  that kind of food thing.  Did you play like  airplanes coming in  for a landing?  Did you do like  stuff like that?  No, because I would  have been the spruce goose  and I would have  probably crashed.  And Howard Hughes  referenced.  Whoa.  How good are you? 
[00:21:00]  Take a couple of  donuts out of  petty cash.  So when did you decide  that you had enough?  Well, it was 1989.  I had maxed out  at about 850.  Sex had stopped  about 300 pounds ago.  Oh, really?  She just gave up on you?  Well, no.  It just goes away.  You're not able to.  Well, yeah.  She couldn't find it.  Yeah, it doesn't  function anymore.  Really?  It functions in one  capacity and that's  to urinate.  That's it.  Oh, you couldn't  sport no chubs? 
[00:21:30]  Well, you can,  but not to where  it was any use.  You know, it was  just, it was too  well covered up.  All dead sexy.  Did you lay there?  Look at my sexy body.  No, you wouldn't  be saying that  looking in my mirror.  No.  So the sex ended  and you decided  to get rid of  this one, huh?  Well, she was  cheating on me  with a neighbor  upstairs, a normal  sized guy.  So at that point.  Well, that's how  we started out.  Yeah.  That was it. 
[00:22:00]  Goodbye.  Yeah, well,  that's how it starts.  Like a Stephen King?  character or something.  It just goes around.  Yeah.  Making guys big,  fat pigs  and then ditching them.  Wow.  You know what, dude?  I'll tell you something.  She did this to a guy  after me.  There was another guy.  I ran across her  like three,  four years later.  I had gotten down  to about 600 pounds.  I was getting around  and I came across her again  and there she was.  She had met a guy.  He was about 200  when he met her 
[00:22:30]  at that time  and he was probably  at about six.  Oh, man.  Is that something?  This chick had a fetish  and she didn't mind  going for what she wanted.  Is it also true  that she got abusive  when you decided  you didn't want  to eat as much?  Oh, yeah.  You know,  if there was any time  that I didn't completely  finish the,  you know,  half a pack of hot dogs  that she'd make  with buns  and, you know,  a big bag of Lay's chips  and a half a gallon  ice cream,  one time in particular  I left two hot dog buns 
[00:23:00]  at the very ends,  okay,  sitting on the plate.  She came home  from whatever  she was out doing,  probably shopping for more  and she saw  these two hot dog buns  on the end of the plate.  She goes,  what's that?  And I go,  well,  I was done.  You know,  I had,  you know,  three pounds  of other food.  I don't need those.  And she just walked  past me,  behind me a little bit,  grabbed this cane  out of the closet  or whatever  and next thing I knew  I was getting whacked  over the back of the head 
[00:23:30]  with it.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  What a cook.  At that point,  I was about 800 pounds  and for people listening,  you don't,  you know,  I mean,  sure,  I could have grabbed  her,  broke her like a twig,  then I'm in prison for life.  Right, yeah.  What good does that do me?  Okay.  At 850,  you don't just get out  and hail a taxi.  Right.  Okay.  Wow.  That's what I was in.  This is a Stephen King novel.  Eat it!  Eat it!  Look at that!  Hey,  if you have his number,  have him get a hold of me.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  I've never heard of that before.  That's something.  Where is she now?  She's,  she lives in California  out here somewhere.  I have no idea.  She's out there  with a short skirt  and a butt cake.  Yeah.  How did this,  how did this end up ending?  Well,  it's,  well,  my story hasn't ended yet.  I just,  we just split up.  it was to where,  it was to the point where,  hey,  look,  we're just done.  Right.  Uh,  she was in agreement  and we just split up.  Wow.  I got on my own.  I started eating naturally. 
[00:24:30]  I wasn't naturally a,  you know,  a 12 hot dog for lunch guy.  Right.  Okay.  I just started eating normally,  you know,  and I dropped down to what I am now.  I've actually been lower,  less than what I am now,  but I'm not because of the yo-yo diet thing.  I'm,  I'm at a point.  Did people you,  uh,  knew just say,  hey,  dude,  what's happening to you?  You're blown up.  Oh my God.  I had friends,  my parents,  my mother,  but the whole thing was so controlled by her  that understand this.  Anytime she left the house, 
[00:25:00]  all the phones were gone.  I had no way of communicating.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Oh yeah.  I cut you off.  It's the flip side of abuse.  You know,  instead of the man abusing the woman,  it was the woman abusing a man in a very bizarre way.  I understand.  Wow.  There's a couple notes that,  uh,  our producer wrote down.  There's a car story.  A car story.  Air conditioning went nuts.  Oh yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Um, 
[00:25:30]  she made you eat a Buick.  Yeah.  She was,  no,  no,  I never did that.  She,  uh,  would get so upset.  I was just telling your producer about one time where,  um,  wherever we went anywhere,  like one,  I remember one hot summer day,  I had to go to the doctor's office.  I was in the car and it was sweat.  Anytime that I sweated,  it was,  you know,  she would make every effort to keep me as cool as possible.  Yeah.  You'd lose weight if you sweat.  Exactly.  You sweat.  That was her whole theory.  You lose weight.  Oh,  I always had,  you know,  whatever to drink, 
[00:26:00]  air conditioner on full.  Anytime she would get out,  go in the store,  you know,  the engine,  she'd leave it running so the air conditioner would be up.  Well,  one time the engine was overheating and I had to turn it off.  Yeah.  And she was still in there about another 15 minutes.  I rolled down the windows and I'm sweating.  She comes out just freaking.  I mean,  dude,  she's all over the place.  Run around the car.  What are you doing?  She actually picked up a magazine and started fanning me.  What are you doing?  What are you,  nuts? 
[00:26:30]  It's like misery.  If it starts,  we can go home.  If it don't start,  I'm going to sweat another 10 pounds off.  Why do you drink your sweat?  Why do you put up with this?  Drink your sweat.  Rick,  why do you put up with this?  Well,  you know,  it was,  I did it all for the new kid.  Come on,  the new kid.  So you can take that donut and stick it up your ass.  Yeah,  well,  it wasn't that bad.  It wasn't that bad.  Come on.  Wow.  It was,  it was a matter of where I was brought up.  it wasn't that bad.  Yeah,  I mean,  the poor guy was,  he was a turtle on his back. 
[00:27:00]  What's he going to do?  He's 800 pounds.  Yeah.  He's beating him with a cane.  Yeah.  Anything else you could add to this,  Rick?  I'm on my way to the road to recovery.  Right now,  I'm down to 537.  Right.  And,  I'm getting ready to have the phobie pouch surgery.  Right.  Which is the same one that Roseanne Barr had done.  Sure.  Wow.  And,  it's just a fantastic thing.  I never wanted to mutilate my body to take care of my problem,  but I've gotten to the point where I'm 41 years old, 
[00:27:30]  and that's it.  I've got to do something.  All right.  You're in any relationship now or anything?  No,  no relationships out there.  You know,  in California,  this is where all the pretty people live,  and if you don't fit into that category,  you know,  forget about it.  Sal,  what's up?  It sounds like maybe his wife grew up in the Midwest,  and her father raised veal.  What's the name of this fetish he had, Rick?  Well,  I believe it was,  I mean,  I've gotten,  I never knew there was one, 
[00:28:00]  but I've had the people contact me saying it's Feeders.  Feeders.  Feeders.  Feeders.  That's the name of the book.  Stephen King's latest novel,  Feeders.  Based on the novel,  Eat,  Beat,  and Bang.  Oh,  man.  Very nice.  Was she really hot?  Yeah.  She looked a lot like Marlo Thomas of that girl.  Oh,  really?  She was,  when I met her,  that's what she looked like,  very much so.  Wow. 
[00:28:30]  Big brown eyes.  She was a model.  Oh,  cool,  cool story.  She wasn't ugly.  That's the best story of the day,  I'll tell you right now,  right?  You know,  unfortunately it happened to me,  but hey.  Can we send you some food or anything?  No,  thanks.  All right.  I don't think I can eat that.  I just do have a website that people can go check out and see,  read more details,  see pictures of me,  stuff like that.  Any pictures of her on there?  No,  no pictures of her.  Oh,  you ought to pop one up.  Yeah.  I don't want to get in trouble.  You won't get in trouble.  What's she going to do?  Get you fat and beat you?  Sure,  you did that. 
[00:29:00]  Email us a picture of her.  No,  Double Jeopardy.  Yeah,  send us a picture.  Yeah,  I want to see what this is.  Give a picture?  Oh,  yeah,  that'll be great.  Two hours.  Oh,  no,  we don't even have access to a website.  Yeah,  we don't have websites or anything.  Actually,  my story will be out in the National Enquirer probably within about two weeks.  Really?  That will have a picture of her because back in 88,  she entered us in a contest where it was the,  you know,  the Enquirer has these weird contests. 
[00:29:30]  It was the Mary.  4H?  No,  with the largest weight differential.  Oh,  really?  Yeah,  we blew them away,  won a measly 500 bucks or something,  and they came out,  took a bunch of pictures.  I'll say they had pictures.  They had pictures of him and her,  of me and her before.  Well,  then I guess we'll see her picture there.  Yeah,  you will see her,  definitely.  All right,  Rick,  give out your website address here.  It's www.IntoTheWeb.com.  IntoTheWeb.com.  Yeah,  it's just all kinds of stuff,  message boards,  you know, 
[00:30:00]  you guys can just go check it out and see pictures of what I look like at 850.  All right,  it better not be a paid site because we get pissed off of that.  Dude,  it's all free.  All right,  very cool.  I don't believe in that.  If it was a paid site,  we'd come over there and beat you with a cane or something.  Shove a ham sandwich up your ass and beat you up.  Are you the comedian on the show?  Oh,  no.  Trust comedians.  No,  they're not.  Very serious.  All right,  Rick,  thank you.  Good luck,  man.  You guys have a good one,  man.  All right,  bye.  Take care.  There he goes,  Rick,  and his unusual fetish.  Wow.  Opie,  you're a sick ass man. 
[00:30:30]  Anthony,  you're not a jackass,  you're obviously a star.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sick.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  More with Adam Farrar in just a bit here.  And whatever you have for the show,  give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Black Crows.  Hard to handle.  WNEW.  I can't even believe these morons.  Opie,  he's a disgusting little man.  And Anthony.  What a douchebag.  Trainwreck radio.  Stand over.  This is sicker than faces of death. 
[00:31:00]  1827 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  I fight jackass.  This is debauchery mania.  I fight jackass.  Prostate exam for everyone.  I fight jackass.  1027 WNEW.  Ah,  yes.  And in the studio this afternoon,  Adam Farrar,  everyone.  Hello.  Yeah,  Adam's there,  man.  Hi,  boy.  Out of nowhere,  he decided to stop by  and say hi to his pals.  Yes.  I bet Hillary doesn't get bumped 
[00:31:30]  from Letterman.  Okay.  Adam came in.  I bet you my girlfriend  doesn't get oral favors  from a page.  Yeah,  huh?  Wow.  So,  yeah,  Adam was supposed to do Letterman  last time he was on the show.  What,  last week?  You know what I like?  Every time I come in here,  it's,  hi,  we're going to break your balls  for a little bit.  First,  that you dated my sister.  Then it's the Olive Garden commercial.  Then I think you nailed me  on the Love Boat episode I did.  I missed that damn thing.  You better have a tape of that.  I,  I want to play all the tapes of that. 
[00:32:00]  Are you kidding me?  Because I got to see that.  You were on the,  Adam was on an episode  of the new Love Boat.  The new Love Boat.  Oh,  don't start.  You want me to sing  some of the early songs you wrote?  Thank you,  no.  Okay.  But we got a lot of crabs on here.  Oh,  Dara.  I didn't write that.  That was Joe Buck's song.  Oh,  Joe Buck wrote that?  Yeah,  my brother wrote that one.  That one sucked.  Wait,  how does it,  wait,  wait,  wait,  wait.  There's too much going on here.  What?  What was the song?  It's a song for two people.  Me and Anthony.  Yeah,  right?  Not really. 
[00:32:30]  He sung a song called Dara?  But Joe wrote it.  Now,  there's a lot,  the early collections of As Is,  spelled A-Z-I-Z,  which is the name of like  90% of the cab drivers.  All right.  Yeah.  That was the name of one of your bands?  As Is.  You think I named it?  Okay.  Look,  I showed up drunk to sing.  That was the extent of it.  Now you're Jim Morrison.  I didn't move equipment.  Yeah,  I'm sorry.  I didn't write the song.  Now you're Jim Morrison.  Before,  when you were going,  my voice,  he's walking around with an ascot and an atom.  Oh,  yeah,  right. 
[00:33:00]  Don't come back.  I must keep everybody away.  Why?  Because we're doing,  what was that song you used to do with that boss?  Lido.  I can't hit the Lido.  The Lido Shuffle.  The Lido Shuffle.  Get out of here.  You don't miss the boat.  It's breaking up.  I need more mist in my throat.  Can we transpose this to my key?  I've seen it work it, man.  After a gig,  it's hilarious.  Jesus.  The rest of his band is like shuffling the equipment back to the van,  and there's Ann drinking his Budweiser at the bar going, 
[00:33:30]  hey, man.  Tell me more about my eyes.  Come on.  What do you expect?  That was a while ago.  That was fun, though.  I like,  because I used to run the lights,  and Anthony would build,  you know,  he's a mad scientist,  for God's sake.  You know,  you leave something at his house,  he MacGyvers it into a helicopter.  It was toothpicks and a rubber band.  Not anymore.  It's in a spruce goose, too.  So,  he used to hook up the light board  with,  like,  you had,  these big rubber Luco gloves  because of the 220 off the pole. 
[00:34:00]  You had to actually open up  the circuit breaker box  in the club  and clamp on these big,  looked like jumper cables.  They were jumper cables.  Oh.  Onto the 220 bolts,  onto the 2110 legs  coming out of the box.  And so,  and they're live.  You can't shut it off  because the club is running.  Yeah.  So,  you'd have to sit there  with big rubber gloves on it.  Pfft,  pfft.  And it was like,  ghost buzzers,  don't cross the streams.  Because if those things touch,  he could electrocute himself.  So,  he would take the 220 lines  and he would channel it 
[00:34:30]  through all this stuff  into an old Atari board.  Remember Atari board  with the four switches?  And that's what,  we had four channels of lights  and that's how we would move the lights.  That was when the original  light board broke,  my friend,  and I had to rig it.  Oh,  the one you built?  That shop driver?  The one you stole?  Yeah.  Some stupid lighting company  in Jersey rented us lights.  We never brought them back.  Yeah.  You know what I like?  A terrorist tried to get  the deposit back on the van.  He doesn't bring back a light day.  Remember that?  Wow.  Too funny.  Well, 
[00:35:00]  that was many,  many years ago.  Many,  many years ago.  And of course,  we do dredge up these things  and things that you did  in the past  because,  I don't know why,  it's not interesting at all.  It's not.  It's abusing the us.  But we were saying  you got bumped from Letterman.  That's where it started.  And it was last week.  And there's a lot of people  on the phone  that feel bad for you.  Thank you.  Kathleen?  Yeah,  I want to know  how many times  have you been bumped  from Letterman?  What's the process like  and does it really piss you off?  This is my first time  being bumped.  It hurts  and I'm getting over the pain.  Thank you, Kathleen. 
[00:35:30]  Adam walked through  our studio door today.  I said,  hey,  if you were on Letterman last week,  I don't think we would  have saw your face for a while.  Yeah,  I know.  He'd have been elsewhere.  I was coming back here today  to plug my governor's days.  He'd have been elsewhere.  I'm a whore.  That's why.  I'm going to see you  tomorrow night.  Cool.  Definitely.  Come down.  Thursday,  Friday,  Saturday and Sunday  and they'll come down  after services.  They set up the Ferrara cot  in the back,  I guess.  Keeping you there  the whole weekend.  Sure.  You better call ahead.  I'm following the seal. 
[00:36:00]  Adam does very well.  Look at you.  You sound like my mother's friend.  He's in show business  doing very well.  Very well.  He's doing very well.  I understand he has  dental through the union.  How's mom and big Joe?  Mom and my father.  Yeah.  I told you they came  into Letterman.  They said it was a big night.  She wore the fur.  Yeah.  I feel so bad.  His parents go to Letterman.  They're sitting right there  up front  to see their son  on national TV.  David Letterman.  Pop took a nap  in the afternoon  so it'd be all right.  So he could stay away. 
[00:36:30]  Sure.  And what happens?  He gets bummed  and your parents  had to get up  and leave  without seeing you  hit the big stage there.  No, my father's like,  hey, it happens.  That's life.  You want Chinese?  That was it, huh?  That was it.  You got some steamed dumplings  and you move on.  Adam, I remember a time  I went to see a governor's  and I'm thinking  Anthony's friend,  big Hollywood star.  He was doing the sitcoms  and the guest appearances  and stuff.  I brought Sandy, right?  We're walking  across the parking lot.  There you are  before your big night  at governor's  changing a tire.  I'm changing a flat tire. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, yeah.  And you know what's  funny?  My travel plans now  is my father's  plumbing truck  because mom's got  to take the caddy  to Marjone.  I'm not actually  changing a tire.  I'm getting into  my next role  on Caroline in the City  where I have to  change a tire.  I'm researching it.  We all consider ourselves  to be in show business  and we look up to you,  Adam,  and I'm like,  wow,  you really should  raise your goal.  I'm like,  look at Adam  changing a tire.  I'm like,  where's his people?  I'm like,  people.  You're the only 
[00:37:30]  like pal I have  that's in show business.  Like that.  What are you,  in real estate?  What the hell  do you think you're doing?  I'm not my own pal.  What?  I'm not my own pal.  I've heard you talk  to yourself many times.  Usually after a gig,  who does Joe Buck  think he is?  I'm the leader  of this band.  Yeah.  As is,  behind the music.  That happens.  As is.  AZ-IZ.  AZ-IZ.  That was so long ago  and stuff on the Trump kit.  That was so long ago.  It was ridiculously long ago.  But you've got to share 
[00:38:00]  a little bit.  To the point where,  no,  it was.  That wasn't even the first,  what was the first name  you've been?  I couldn't even remember.  Did you guys have  the hair going stuff?  Like the silver platter?  It was ridiculous.  It was, yeah,  80s,  so you wanted to try the one.  Flying down the highway  in a makeshift muddle.  Yeah,  we were doing  Brady Bunch cover tunes  is what we were doing,  Adam.  You're absolutely right.  It's a sunshine day  when it's time to change.  Yeah,  that's exactly  what we were doing.  Although,  we did do some  Spinal Tap covers.  I remember this.  That was fun.  That's classic.  Chris,  what's up?  What's going on?  How you doing? 
[00:38:30]  How you doing?  Hey,  I'm Adam,  man.  Yes.  I feel really bad for you  because you got bumped  by that space-tooth moron.  Thank you,  Chris.  Space-tooth moron.  You know what I'm saying?  Thank you,  Chris.  All right,  man,  you are the best,  yo,  Adam.  Thank you.  All right.  You think,  yeah,  tonight,  you think Dave's  going to have,  you know,  45 minutes of crap,  stupid bits  where he takes a camera  to the film store  next door from the studio  while Hillary waits  in the green room  wondering if she's  going to be on? 
[00:39:00]  I don't think so.  And who's more entertaining,  Hillary or Adam Ferrara?  Adam Ferrara.  Adam Ferrara.  Absolutely.  Never saw Hillary  say Hospitaliano.  Oh,  there it is.  There it is.  There had to be  a bite away  in there somewhere,  Alice.  All right.  What's bite away?  Aha!  Anna.  Yeah,  hi.  How are you?  Good.  How are you boys?  Good.  One time,  I seen Adam  at a governor's. 
[00:39:30]  Oh,  really?  Yeah,  he's pretty hot.  Yes,  he is,  isn't he?  I want to grab  onto his buns.  Adam.  Adam,  she wants to grab  your buns.  I'm not sure  what I'm supposed  to say,  so,  you know.  I'm not sure  what I'm supposed  to say.  Hey,  whose sister  are you?  Hey,  I got seven  of them.  Which one  do you want?  Adam has  something for  all the sisters  on this radio  show.  Wow.  Now,  so you met  him,  what,  backstage?  Well,  he was like 
[00:40:00]  kind of back  then.  I was walking  past him  and I walked  up to him  and I,  you know,  I asked him  what's pink  and smells  like pussy  cats and he's  like what?  And I stuck  my tongue  out at him  and then I  told him,  I'm like,  oh,  I remember  you.  I remember  that.  Interesting.  You can't  remember that  because that  doesn't happen  every day.  And then I  was telling  you about,  I guess,  I could say  Tuesday night  at Hummer  Club,  I do that  and I let  my friend  watch as  I'm doing  it too,  you know,  my old  man.  Boy,  it sure  sounded like  you could  have gotten  lucky here. 
[00:40:30]  That's when  you fell  on your butt.  You're like,  oh my God.  So if Adam  would have been  up to it,  would you have  given him a  Hummer that  night?  It wasn't  Thursday.  My old  man was  home,  sure.  It was the  wrong day  of the week.  Oh my God.  It could be  any day of  the week.  I'm always  up for that.  You should  see Adam  when he gets  done with  his show.  He comes  out to the  bar in the  front by  Governor  since then.  I'm going  to go.  Digging  him and  stuff.  I know  he's got  to be  nice.  Isn't  he married?  No,  he's got  a girlfriend  though. 
[00:41:00]  He's in  a very  serious  relationship.  How is  she?  She's  nice one.  Can I  meet her?  Can I  meet her?  Oh,  meet.  Yeah,  can I  meet her?  I thought  you said  something else.  I'll take  both of  yous on,  honey.  Whoa.  So you  going to  go to  Governor's?  I don't  know.  When's  the next  time you're  going?  He's  there Thursday,  Friday,  Saturday,  and Sunday.  Yeah,  why don't  you come  to my  house instead,  baby?  Wow.  Do you  remember  what she  looked like  and all?  No. 
[00:41:30]  No,  huh?  What do  you look  like there?  Let's  see.  Well,  I'm a  dancer.  Really?  Yeah.  Where?  Like,  why?  Flash  dancers?  Stonehenge.  Stonehenge?  Out on  Long Island?  Yeah,  with them.  That  place  rocked.  I love  that place.  I have  the best  time.  So you're  a dancer  there,  huh?  By me  Rumpelman.  Oh,  boy.  Do you  dance during  the week  or do you  dance on  the weekend?  During  the day.  I don't  like going  at night.  Uh-oh,  day  dancing.  You're  a matinee.  Day  dancing  at  Stonehenge. 
[00:42:00]  That's  scary.  You know  why they  usually put  the girls  that aren't  that hot  on in the  day?  I'm just  saying,  because when  you walk  in there  from all  the bright  light into  the dark  club,  it takes  you a  half hour  before you  can see  anything.  And then  by that  time,  you'll have  a couple  of $10  beers.  I don't  like going  at night  because I  got better  things to do  at night.  And it  looks like  you're in  the double-A  ball.  Yeah,  yeah.  What's a  double-A  ball?  You've got  to be  brought  up to  the majors.  It's  like  open  pole  night. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Wow,  Stonehenge.  You look  hot and  stuff.  I'm cool,  man.  You're not  all bruised  up and  everything?  There's  nothing  better than  looking at  a dancer.  It looks  like she's  gone a  couple  of rounds  with Tyson.  A  scar.  She's  all beat  up.  An old  cigarette  burns.  No,  nothing like  that.  You're  not skanked  up then.  I'm  trying to  eat  frank  in  a car.  There's  a lot  going on.  You have  a D  cup?  Yeah.  Wow.  What's  the other 
[00:43:00]  one?  There was  five people  talking to  one time  I heard  that.  But she  said she  has a  D  cup.  What's  the other  one?  It's in  the middle  of her  head.  I'm  deaf,  you know,  with the  bells.  Well,  you ought  to go  down to  a  governor's  and  see  out.  Welcome  to  the  main  stage,  Medusa.  He'll  know who  you are  now.  Oh,  yeah?  Telling you  that  stripper  from  Stonehenge.  It's  red.  Oh,  you're  redhead?  Yeah.  Natural?  Well,  I got  no hair 
[00:43:30]  on my  neck.  Really?  You know,  I like  a girl  that edits  herself.  There you  go.  Do you  shave it  or did  it fall  out?  You know,  ever since  Shoram  reactivated,  was it  rubbed  off?  With  your face,  honey.  There you  go.  She's not  messing around.  Definitely  not.  She's hurt  at all.  Any piercings  that we should  know about?  I'm not a  freak.  No?  Any  tattoos?  I don't  think that  crap.  No tattoos?  No?  No tattoos?  No tattoos.  All right.  Well, 
[00:44:00]  she's  I'm a  good girl.  You sound  like a  church  girl.  Yeah.  All right,  baby.  Come down  and say  hello.  I use  the term  loosely.  All right,  Anna,  we'll see  Adam this  weekend at  Governor's,  okay?  All right.  Thursday,  Friday,  Saturday,  Sunday.  I want a  promo seat,  honey.  Okay.  All right.  You're going  to have a  ticket waiting  for me?  We'll see  what we can  do.  If you  wear a  skirt,  no underwear,  put your  legs up  on the  stage while  he's  performing,  you can  work it  out.  All right,  then I'll  show you  if I'm  going to  go back  in the 
[00:44:30]  crowd.  Slide  down.  Look at  that.  I didn't  know  Governor's  had  drink  cozies.  Drink  down?  Cozy.  Wow.  Oh,  my God.  All right,  Anna.  We've  got to  fly.  Oh,  go.  Bye.  Bye.  During the  day,  dancing.  Yeah,  the day  dancing.  They don't  give them  mints.  Well,  you know  what the  clientele  the day  dancers  get?  It's all  construction  workers that  don't want 
[00:45:00]  to frigging  work.  So they  go in  there during  the day.  You figure,  we'll leave  the job,  we'll have  an early  lunch,  and we'll  get back  to work  right after  lunch.  We'll be  back to  work by  one.  You go  there at  noon,  it opens  up.  By four  o'clock,  you're going,  gee,  screw it.  We'll leave  the tools  out.  We've got  to be  there tomorrow  anyway.  You never  go back.  Give us  some ten  penny  nails for  a lap dance.  And that's  it, too.  You're broke  because you're  never working.  So you just  sit there with  a dollar and  nurse your 
[00:45:30]  beard.  How many  pelts for  a lap dance?  Pretty much.  I'll put in  air conditioning  in your house.  Spin around.  Spin around.  Let me see  your race.  We're off to  a fine start  today, and we  got to take a  quick break.  Look at the  time.  We're very  late, but Adam  Farrar hanging  out with us  today.  We needed  the boost  this week,  Adam, so  thanks for  coming in.  Absolutely.  All right, more  of your phone  calls in just  a bit.  Stay there.  Is this the  best video you  guys can come  up with?  1027 WNEW.  You're hanging 
[00:46:00]  with Hopi and  Anthony and our  buddy Adam Farrar.  It's 1027 WNEW.  Hey, you guys  struck a nerve  because there's a  bunch of people  that want to talk  about daytime  strippers.  Yeah, and  going to the  strip clubs  during the day,  Anthony.  I love walking  out of the  strip club after  you've been in  there, and it's  still light out.  You're like  Frankenstein.  Dirty.  You can't see.  Cars are  beeping at you.  I remember  coming out of  there.  They finally  changed where  the door is  at the carousel 
[00:46:30]  on Jericho  Turnpike there.  Oh, I remember  that place.  The door was  right, like,  10 feet away  from Jericho  Turnpike.  So you'd walk  out, and, you  know, housewives  are looking at  you in horror.  Yeah.  They're all  beeping at you,  like, yeah, yeah,  I was looking  at the strippers.  Now they put  the door kind  of on the side.  That's a little  thing, but you  come out, and  the sun hits  your eyes.  It's like  Shawshank Redemption.  You know?  You're like, oh,  oh, my God,  the light, I'm free.  It's papillon.  You were in the 
[00:47:00]  box.  Papillon, yeah.  It is in the  box.  Put him in the  hole for another  month.  It's the night  where you come  out of the  carousel now.  They have, like,  a car wash  thing to cleanse  you.  Clean you off.  You just feel  dirty.  Send you home  there.  Hey, Frank,  what's up?  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey, great.  Great place where  I went to college  down in San Antonio,  Texas, called  Class Act.  And it was far  from me.  Anything but.  It was B-Y-O-B.  That's how bad  this place was.  Bring your own  boobs?  What's that?  Bring your own  bimbos.  Yeah, yeah.  But the great 
[00:47:30]  thing is they had  a lunch buffet.  Yeah, I never got  that.  I don't like eating  food from strip clubs.  I like to keep  them sick.  It's bad enough  you've got to put  your mouth on a  bottle that's on  the bar that  sometimes they're  walking on.  Now, I haven't  seen this move  in a while in the  Long Island strip  clubs, but I  remember back late  80s and stuff was  the last of this.  The dancers didn't  care.  They'd come right  out on the bar,  you know, open  your bottle for you  without their  hands.  You know, I  mean, like,  like, it's like, 
[00:48:00]  wow, talented  snatch.  The thing  about this  place is the  funniest thing  to watch is we  won after finals  every semester.  It was a  tradition.  And we'd all  get out of finals  about noon and  go get snotted and  watch girls.  And the  funniest thing  to watch was  see the guys  go through the  buffet line,  you know, go  eat stateside,  and as the  girls work their  way around,  watch the guys  cover their  plates.  Yeah, that  moves like their  hands are  covering the  plate, like  that's a  barrier.  You know?  That's going  to do it.  That'll do it.  Believe me,  what's coming 
[00:48:30]  off of that thing?  She just opened  a beer bottle.  Swiss Army  snatch.  I swear to  God, I've  seen that move  too, even with  the beer.  Like a girl  come walking  by and the  guy will take  the coaster and  plop it on top  of his beer glass.  That's got to  make the girl  feel good.  Excuse me, I'm  thinking something  is falling out of  there that even  alcohol can't  kill.  Okay?  I really, I'm  going to cover  this up right  about now.  We were  seniors, spring  semester, we even  got a little bit  too rowdy for 
[00:49:00]  this place.  We were getting  pretty,  pretty nasty  drunk, we were  graduating, and a  buddy of mine brought  in a bottle of  peach schnapps.  And what he did  was he took the  cork out of it, put  it on the stage, and  said, I give you  five bucks if you  pick this up without  your hands.  Yeah, that move.  So they got a little  upset with this.  That was strike one.  So a couple of  minutes later, you  know they have the  lonely action, there's  like waiting for the  second team to come  up on the stage.  Yeah.  So we're really  drunk and one of my  drunkest buddies stands  up and screams, and I  won't, I'll clean this  up, screams, bring on 
[00:49:30]  the sea.  Bring on the sea  word.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  That's great.  Last time I heard that  was on Broadway when they  wanted to bring a...  That was in the Will  Rogers folly.  But the guy spelled it  out with a rope.  Stella Stevens on  stage or something.  Bring on the sea  word.  Oh my God.  That's the same  man who goes home in  the car like, why don't  the chicks dig, man?  What do I got to do?  So would they do to  the guy.  Well, love.  It was like out of a 
[00:50:00]  western, you know, when  the star of the movie  gets called out in the  street for a gunfight.  Yeah.  It was like quiet.  And all of a sudden,  the DJ gets on the  mic and goes, we have  nice girls here.  How dare you talk about  them like that?  And then they kick us  out in the street.  You're lucky they  kicked you out.  A lot of the bars,  you know, the biker guys  that run the place  get the crap out of  you.  Yeah, you're afraid  we're going to get  pulled in the back  room.  Very funny, Frank.  All right, you guys.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  I knew a girl, you  know the ping pong  ball trick, right? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, sure.  She had like laser  sighting.  Really?  She was like, she's  the kind of girl you  want to take to the  carnival to win the  fish.  Right?  Give me two fish  if I don't use my  hand.  Every time it's  but in like those  tall glasses, those  tall bar glasses where  there's not a lot of  room.  And she could get  them in there.  Yeah.  That's a talent.  Sure.  I don't even know how  she was aiming.  You got to adjust like  the windage and the  elevation.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Afternoon.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're pulling a 
[00:51:00]  nooner.  That's what we call them.  We left at noon and we  figured we'd been back by  one and now I'm heading  back right now.  We just got out of the  bar.  See?  And what do you do for a  living?  I'm a plumber in Jersey.  See?  I have been there.  I have been there.  When we worked in  Smithtown, we used to go to  that place right by the  Brass Rail, Brass  Monkey.  No, it was that other  place.  I think it was called  Logan's Run after the  Wild Toads of Frogs or  something.  And then the other  place.  Mr. Toad's Wild Rock.  Mr. Toad's Wild Rock.  Yes, it was.  And then Ron Conkoma had a 
[00:51:30]  place called Birds.  Birds Place.  Man.  I mean, the girls, you  hear this all the time,  but would do anything.  Really?  They had a guy up there  with glasses on, laying on  his back on the stage.  Right.  And believe me, when the  girl was done with him, he  had to clean his glasses  off.  Really?  It was that much of a show  going on on stage.  He thought he had  cataracts.  Yeah, it was that bad.  I saw a stripper with  one foot.  I swear to God. 
[00:52:00]  She had like one foot, a  normal foot, and then  another foot had like  little chiclet toes.  A love foot kind of  thing?  But she wanted to know  if she was done.  That's what you need, a  thalidomide stripper.  Wait, she had her  breasts done.  You'd think you'd take  care of all the other  stuff first.  The general rule of  construction is you don't  put a second floor on a  house with a bad  foundation.  And the construction  guy's got to know that.  That's it, man.  Hey, you were a tin  knocker, right?  Hell yeah.  That's it, man.  That's who we were  drinking with.  We were with the  tin knockers.  Everybody decided to 
[00:52:30]  take a name, but since I'm  the low man on the  totem pole, we left the  bar and everybody caught  me on the back and said,  no, go put the tools  away.  Yeah, go put the tools  away.  Yeah, we had this girl  in there.  She was about 50 years  old and she had a pretty  all right body, but nobody  really paid attention to  the face.  But they called her the  ice queen because she  would put ice all over  her body and then put  it in her mouth and spit  it at you.  But what they forgot to  tell you was she spit it  between her Leon Spinks  space in her teeth.  That's wonderful.  Yeah, I love how the  strippers are doing  things they think is hot and 
[00:53:00]  you think is disgusting.  And you've got to sit  there.  You're like, I'm paying  10 bucks to be a girl  to spit at me.  Can't you floss at  home?  She had like G-string  depends on.  Everybody says I  should have been a  dancer.  They said it in 1942.  Wow.  You don't know how  many hammer drills and  sawzalls were lost  because we just never  went back to the job  site.  We lock up the tools  and no one's going to  steal them.  What happened to the  hammer drill?  I don't know, boss.  We were there the whole  time. 
[00:53:30]  I think the plumbers  took it.  Those bastards  had steam finished.  Hey, Joe, thank you.  Hey, guys, you've got a  train.  Have a good day.  All right, man.  A lot of great stories  on hold, Anthony.  A lot.  If you're on hold,  stay there.  We've got to take  another quick break  because we've been  running late the whole  show today, all right?  Running off the mount.  We'll be back very  shortly.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Yes, we get these  illiterates off the  air, please.  We suck.  If I wasn't on it,  I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:54:00]  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, stacker two,  the world's strongest  fat burner.  That's right.  Hey, you can't be a  stripper when you're  fat, right?  That's right.  So if you're a  stripper, maybe you  put on a few extra  pounds during the  holidays, just packing  in the turkey and ham  and everything.  You've got to lose  that weight quick or  you're not going to  make any tips.  I said tips.  Stacker two,  world's strongest  fat burner.  Uh-huh.  It does three things.  Yes, it, uh, well,  it's the world's  strongest fat burner.  Yeah.  And it gives you a  boost of energy if  you're feeling sluggish  during the last dance  of your shift up on 
[00:54:30]  stage.  Sure.  Reject this song.  Eject this song,  please.  Eject this.  It's too fast.  I can't keep up.  I need more energy.  Does the fat burner  provide that?  And it, uh, what  else does it do?  Oh, it cuts down in  your cravings to  snack during the day  so you can fit more  of those champagne  cocktails in you.  Or during, yeah,  or during the dances.  Yeah.  You know, in between  dances, you don't  want to be snacking.  You lose weight  because a big fat ass  doesn't get the  dollars stuck in the  G-string. 
[00:55:00]  There you go, Anthony.  I'm sure the stacker  people will agree with  that.  Of course they will.  Stacker two, the  world's strongest  fat burner.  They have a website  at www.stacker2.com.  That's stacker2.com,  excuse me, or give  them a call at 1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.

Thousands have proven  it works.  We're back with the 
[00:55:30]  Opiate Anthony Show.  Hey.  Hanging out with us  today, Adam Farrar.  Went to grab a cup of  coffee.  That's right.  Sure, there he is.  Sure.  He'll be at Governor's  all weekend long  starting tomorrow,  Thursday, Friday,  Saturday, Sunday.  Call ahead for tickets.  I'm definitely going  to the Thursday show.  Going tomorrow, man.  Got to see my pal  on his opening night  there at Governor's.  My chance.  The millionth opening  night at Governor's.  Yeah, I know.  He does all the time.  And we're all  keeping our fingers crossed  hoping that Letterman's  people will call Adam.  We must get rescheduled.  Yeah, Adam's looking  to get rescheduled  on Letterman.  They're much too busy 
[00:56:00]  to think about it  today, Anthony.  They got Hillary  on the show tonight.  I think Psycho Mark's  heading down to the  Letterman's studio  to mess with people.  Oh, that's good.  There's nothing like,  you know, secret service  people down there  or anybody that'll  just wrestle him  to the ground  and split his head  open in front of  the David Letterman  Theater over there.  You know, those  deaf people have  attitudes.  What do you mean  deaf people?  The ones with  the little earphones?  They don't like that.  It's just a zoo  down there right now.  They come up  with a Travis Bickle  hairdo. 
[00:56:30]  That'll work.  That's Travis Bickle.  Did she come in  yesterday?  I think so.  I saw the helicopters  yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I was down  like in Wall Street  area and I saw  the helicopter  and I go,  who's coming into town?  There was Hillary.  Must be Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah, that's it.  Yeah, by helicopter.  Sure.  I was on the  Long Island Railroad  this morning  with a big fat guy  sleeping on my shoulder.  Who are you kidding, man?  Did we pass  Minneapolis?  Yeah.  Hillary's still  using our tax dollars  to travel to New York 
[00:57:00]  too, by the way.  Just wanted to  remind you that.  She didn't announce  that she's actually  a candidate for Senate.  No.  So, you know,  she's been saving up  money and getting  donations when she  announces that she's  going to be a candidate.  Right.  Then she has to  use that money.  Right.  But now it's just,  oh, now she's just  taking a trip to New York.  Bill, can I borrow  the car?  Exactly.  Can I borrow  the chopper  and the Marines  that fly it  and the landing strip  and the rerouting  air traffic  just because  her fat ass  is in the air?  Oh, Christ. 
[00:57:30]  Woman makes me sick.  It's going to be a joke  on Letterman tonight  too.  She's not going to  answer anything tonight.  What do you think?  I know.  It's just going to be  stupid, boring TV.  What?  You know,  they probably came up  with some wacky bit.  You know how Dave's  been asking her  to be on the show  and asking and saying  that they've been  declining and declining  and now she's  finally doing it.  So expect some kind  of a bit made out  of that.  Right.  And then it's just  going to be her  preaching and doing  some Rudy bashing.  But doesn't have an agenda  like she's going to  announce she's coming.  She doesn't have an agenda.  She doesn't even 
[00:58:00]  answer questions.  Her popularity has  gone down.  It's below 50%  for the first time  and Rudy's  remain the same.  Well, his has dropped  too, but he's in the lead.  He's still in the lead.  But, you know,  if Letterman and his  people had balls,  I would like to have  Rudy come on tonight.  Oh, yeah.  Don't even tell anyone  in the middle of the interview.  Yeah, he just comes in  and punches her  right in the face.  God, I'd laugh  think they should reenact  the Andy Kaufman,  Jerry Lawler thing  from the old days  of Letterman.  Rudy comes in  with a neck brace on 
[00:58:30]  and smacks Hillary  in the face.  Throws a cup of coffee  on her and leaps.  I'd have Lewinsky in.  Like, all of a sudden,  Monica Lewinsky  just walks on  and sits down next to her.  And they go,  well, what can we talk  about?  What do we both  have in common?  Hmm.  Oh, yeah.  Your husband's schlong.  Now, that'd be a show.  You can only pray  for something like that.  No, it's going to be  blah, blah, blah.  Boring, boring stuff.  She's going to promote  herself, bash Rudy, 
[00:59:00]  and then walk off.  What do you think  her interest is going to be?  Tonight, Hillary Clinton.  Hillary Clinton.  David Letterman.  And comedian Adam Ferrara.  If we have time.  Which we know now we don't.  You can go home now.  Mom and dad.  And take those people  in the balcony with you.  Yes, the big guy  yelling at the page.  Poor dad.  Look, I've got to sit  on the aisle because  I need to go to the bathroom  during a commercial.  Who's got a problem? 
[00:59:30]  This is my reality.  Welcome to it.  All right.  Let's go back to the phone.  But I think Psycho Mark's  going to mess with people  down there.  Cool.  Hopefully he'll get arrested.  There's all kinds of  news trucks and everything  down there.  Barbara.  Hey.  Hey.  How are you, Barbara?  What's up, guys?  All right.  I live around the blocks  from the Stonehenge.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen some of the girls  that work at night.  I can't even imagine  what the day crew looks like.  And the place that...  What? 
[01:00:00]  Don't let the sunlight  hit them.  Please welcome  to the main stage.  Let's start.  And the place that  Anthony was talking about  before used to be  the Bull Creek.  Oh, the Bull Creek.  That was it.  Yeah, that's what he was talking about.  Now, how are you  privy to such information?  Yeah, how do you know all this?  Miss, I needed to get to college.  I live on Long Island.  It's not that big.  Yeah, every Long Islander  knows all that.  Remember the Brass Monkey?  That's the one I'm thinking of.  Yeah, I went to the Brass Monkey.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you were there that time.  And your brother.  And someone threw a shot glass at her.  Yeah.  And I think it was one of the girls 
[01:00:30]  flying it right out of there.  It was amazing.  It was the girl with the hair lip.  Projectile.  Remember her?  She ran out of ping pong balls that night.  Did she have two feet?  We were goofing on her hair lip  and she threw a shot glass at us.  Did she have two feet?  Yes, she had two feet.  How about that?  All right, guys.  Have a good night.  Thank you, Barbara.  Bye.  Yeah, the Brass Monkey.  Let's see.  The carousel, I remember when I was a kid.  Yeah.  It's still there.  Yeah, sure.  It was right by the wagon.  And there was a place  on the corner of Lockfield  and Jericho Turnpike  called the Voyage Inn. 
[01:01:00]  I mean, this was going back  before I could ever even dream of it.  I just remember  exotic West Coast dancers.  It's like,  ooh, what is that?  And my father would be like,  you know,  all right, wait in the car.  I got to talk.  I got to talk to someone in here.  And he'd go in there  and like I'd be waiting there for hours  just sitting in the car.  Really?  I swear.  And he'd come out,  you know, all tanked and stuff.  The guy never made it.  Never met.  Hold on.  It's like he was in there  watching nudes and stuff.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Thanks, Bob.  I was on the road.  Roll the window down a crack,  could you?  I'm getting a contact high.  I was in a,  what was it?  Oh, Green Bay, Wisconsin.  There's a strip club  called Bean Snappers.  Bean Snappers?  I swear to God,  you get in the car,  you drive through the darkness  because it's like  there's no lights and nothing.  It's like,  this is the place.  I thought you meant  it was a bad neighborhood.  I thought maybe Adam  was starting to get  really politically incorrect.  Where's the racist bell?  Jesus.  So you drive through the darkness  and you go to this,  in the middle of nowhere, 
[01:02:00]  this is like where,  where like the flying saucers land.  Yeah.  You know,  they go,  they come down  and look at my ass.  So it's an empty barn.  It's a barn.  There's like linoleum  on the floor.  There's a guy,  no booze  because you can't have  naked girls in booze,  but you got to spend  like four bucks  for cranberry juice.  And it's a juice bar  with naked girls,  but you know,  the girls that drink,  can I have the cranberry juice?  My bladder infection,  I'm up next.  You know,  they got just as scary as girls.  I have an inflamed urethra.  I could use the cranberry juice. 
[01:02:30]  We have so many stories  on the line.  Where do we want to go?  Yeah.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe,  you're next on WNAW.  What's up?  Yo,  guys,  one of my favorite topics  of all time.  I love the T-bars,  as we call them.  Oh,  yeah.  Patterson,  New Jersey,  has some of the skankiest,  let me tell you.  There's three in a row  on Market Street.  They go from,  you know,  young Brazilian,  Russian girls and everything  to like grandmothers,  this one joint moonlight.  Oh,  and you can do,  with your clothes on, 
[01:03:00]  you can do almost anything  in the three of them,  I'm telling you.  Oh,  really?  Basically,  buy a chick a drink  and you're married to her  for that night.  It's incredible.  It's just,  it's not like nothing  you've ever seen.  You ever get out to New Jersey,  you go to Patterson,  Market Street,  ask anybody,  they'll know,  they'll know who I'm talking about,  you know?  Well,  I like the skanky bars sometimes  because they really appreciate  the buck.  Absolutely.  You know,  when you go to the high-class  strip clubs  and you get the girls  that really look hot,  you're not going to get  anything for a buck.  You slip them a five  and they give you  one quick little look  and then you need  at least a 20 
[01:03:30]  for a lap dance.  It's funny you say that  because the hotter the chick,  like the less you watch it do,  you know?  It's like you go  to the grandmother joint  and there's no rules.  Oh,  you go to a skank club,  let me tell you,  skank club,  the tender trap,  Jericho Turnpike,  Oh,  yes.  Yeah,  right next to the radiator place.  Let me tell you something.  They got  10 silver dispensers  on the wall.  Yeah.  You go in there  for like a buck,  you could get  anything you want.  The girls appreciate that. 
[01:04:00]  They look like war pigs,  but for the love of God,  for a buck,  well,  they're appreciative.  And they'll shake  that flat,  flabby ass  right in your face.  It's Borneo.  They had the lost art  in there too,  Anthony.  Ah,  yes.  The rug act.  The rug dance,  rug act.  Yes.  Oh,  yes.  Remember that?  You rarely see  the rug act anymore.  Remember that?  The girl would come out  and she,  and I dare you.  Take a little blanket.  She had that little quilt  from when she was  in ninth grade  that grandma quilted  probably. 
[01:04:30]  Put it on the floor,  hit the jukebox,  this little,  we got tonight,  who needs tomorrow,  let's make it less.  And she's just like,  just like,  raving on the floor.  She's like a praying mantis.  It's the rug act.  With her hand lotion.  Yeah,  lotion.  And then she's pointing  it right at you.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  She's got her legs  right at you.  It's like chicken.  Who's going to flinch first?  And she's off. 
[01:05:00]  How did you blink?  Made my eyes to you.  You made me blink.  The legs are going up  and apart.  And your buddies  are trying to sneak  a look over your shoulder.  Like it's a peep show.  Yeah,  come on,  hurry up  before the quarter runs out.  The rug act.  You don't see that  that much anymore.  And I defy you  to find a donkey show.  We've got tonight.  We've got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow?  That slow song.  The slow song.  My first strip club experience, 
[01:05:30]  the first song I ever heard  in a strip club  was House of the Rising Sun.  Really?  There is a house  in the water is.  Like when the girl  tries to dance though  and then does that.  Could you eject this song?  I'm not feeling it.  Eject.  And she feels like  she has to cover up  at that moment.  Yeah.  Now I'm naked.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Could you eject?  I'm out of courage.  She's got to start over.  Yeah.  And it makes you feel  like she likes you so much  she comes over  and gives you the eyes.  She puts her breasts  down towards you,  grabs your dollar 
[01:06:00]  with her cleavage,  gives you a little smile,  a little wink,  a little look,  stands up,  turns away,  takes the buck  and throws it in a pile  with the others.  Oh, I'm just a mark.  I thought she liked me  this time.  I like the bachelor party.  I thought we were  going to do it.  I thought we were  going to go out  after she got off work.  What are you doing  looking at my girl?  I like the bachelor party  because the bachelor  is always like  Kennedy drunk.  Really?  You know?  Yeah.  And his friends 
[01:06:30]  are always like,  come on, man,  look at the way  that dancer's looking at you.  She likes you for you.  You got to go.  It's not the fact  we gave her $200.  Oh, yeah.  She was a person.  Out of the hundreds  of bachelors.  She's hobbed.  She really likes you.  Hob.  What kind of verb  is that?  Hob.  Too hob.  We got a speaking code  on this show.  Our buddy Foote  is on the line.  Foote!  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up?  Hey, just tuned in  to the show.  I don't know  if there's a couple  of stories  the guys didn't tell you  about the time  that we were  at the tender trap 
[01:07:00]  and Anthony started  goofing on this  native American dancer  who was an Indian.  Oh, yeah.  I was calling her squad.  Yeah, and Anthony  started going  right on.  She got pissed.  She stops, man.  She starts yelling  at Anthony.  I'm like,  very sorry.  Yeah.  Me, me,  heap, heap sorry.  Yeah.  Me pissing you off.  White man,  screw me.  We open casino.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Try dancing to this squad. 
[01:07:30]  I remember that  because you go,  what are you going to do,  make it rain?  Yeah.  She's doing a rain dance.  I don't know  if Adam told this story  when Adam was over,  where the hell was he?  He went over  to Billy Joel's house,  knocked on the door  and asked him  where the carousel was.  Oh, God.  You're going,  what was I?  I was like 14 years old.  Yeah.  You knocked on  Billy Joel's house?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was lost.  Yeah.  And I knew who lived there.  Yeah.  I knew he lived there. 
[01:08:00]  What was that,  Lloyd Neck or something?  Yeah, it was Lloyd Neck.  The one on the house  in Lloyd Neck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ozzy was with me.  Yeah.  He goes,  where the hell are we?  He says,  oh, I know who lives here.  Pull over.  I know who lives here.  Oh, I did.  I saw it.  I knew he lived there.  He didn't know you.  What were you doing  in that area?  There's nothing there.  I think we were  in the fencing truck.  We were working.  We were working during the day  and we finished the job early  and I'm like,  I don't want to go back  to the shop now.  Fiddle put me on a forklift.  I want to go out.  So Ozzy goes,  where are we going to go?  How are we going to get out of here? 
[01:08:30]  He says, pull over here.  I know the guy that lives there.  No, but God.  Well, he goes,  who lives there?  I go, ah, you don't know him.  So I got out  and I knocked on the door  and he came out.  Billy Joel.  And I asked him.  Did he know?  Yeah, he knew.  Like, he wasn't always Billy Joel.  He had a day job.  All right, I got to go.  Hey, before I go,  Ant, you say you're going  to Thursday's show?  Sure.  You got to go to Friday's show.  Why?  Very special guest emceeing.  Oh, is Joseph T. Curry  going to be emceeing the show?  Joseph Curry emceeing  the Friday show.  Joseph Curry.  All right.  Way to go, Fiddle. 
[01:09:00]  All right, see you guys later, man.  All right, so many goddamn comics  plugging their goddamn shows  on this goddamn show.  This is the Friars Club.  The Young Friars Club.  All right, Adam Farrar in studio.  Playing Governors Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Call for ticket info, okay?  Yeah.  We got to take a break.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fast!  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, it's Adam Farrar.  Hey.  In the studio. 
[01:09:30]  Having lots of fun today.  Hope you're enjoying the festivities.  What are you hanging in?  Man, I saw NYPD Blue last night.  Finally, the season premiere.  January 12th, season premiere.  Yeah, they pushed it way back.  What was their reasoning?  Well, I guess because it wasn't doing well in the ratings.  No, I thought it was doing very well, but they had...  I thought that's what...  They had some other show on that they...  But I thought at first that, you know, it was dipping a little bit in the ratings,  so they backed off to give this other show a chance, no?  No, they used that time slot to launch the other show, 
[01:10:00]  which is like that once and again, over and under.  What was the one?  Oh, um...  The only two divorced people.  We got caught having sex again.  Damn.  You know, that one.  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  Who cares?  But NYPD Blue, very good.  Very good.  I've been watching it for a couple of years now, and I thought it was pretty good.  Rick Schroeder, always surprising the hell out of me when I see him,  because you expect, you know, little Ricky Schroeder.  Sure.  And he turns out to be a pretty good actor.  Yeah.  He's like a good actor. 
[01:10:30]  And then the end of the show.  Ah.  Boobage.  Right there.  Channel 7.  They're doing that like crazy.  ER had a nice boob shot, didn't they?  A few weeks back, sure.  Yeah, but ER, when they do it, it's usually some breast cancer show.  Ah!  I hate that.  No, that's the truth.  It's like a double-edged sword.  You're seeing a boob, but it's like, ah, you know, it's under bad circumstances.  It was Rebecca DeMornay.  Yeah.  Rebecca DeMornay.  DeMornay, okay.  And she was in bed on top.  Right.  And they had the, they used to have just the back shot of the, you know, the topless 
[01:11:00]  woman.  Yeah.  Oh, they're swinging that camera around.  They're swinging the camera around now, and it's like side leading toward front boob shots  now.  Yeah, Rick Schroeder was with this chick last night.  Is it an armpit view?  Well, it's even more so.  It's an angle.  I mean, it's everything but the nip.  He's making out with this girl and stuff and like grinding on her and everything.  And then the camera kind of goes around and sees side boob.  And she had some, oh, yeah.  Cool, major dairy.  And stunt breasts.  Yeah.  They were very nice.  And then the camera kept going around a little more. 
[01:11:30]  And you're seeing a little more of the boob.  Channel 7.  I'm like, oh, look at this.  And didn't he use the P word last night?  Yeah.  Take a piss?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know if we could say that.  We did.  If they say it on.  I don't know if we made it out over the air.  If they say it on network TV.  Why can't we say it on the radio?  I don't know.  There's a different set of rules.  Take a, take a P.  Take a P.  But they use the real word.  Right.  All right.  And Sipowitz grabbed his schlong.  His junk.  His junk.  Shook it at some guy.  His junk. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Like it makes a metal sound.  We have code words for everything on the show, Adam.  Oh, he's using the word scumbag.  Scumbag.  And skills.  Skills.  Oh, I love that when they, they, uh, what was that thing?  What did they call it when the cops were beating up the guy?  Keyed him up a little or?  They keyed up a scale.  God damn, that's your rules.  We keyed up a scale.  Very nice.  Yeah, so it was, uh.  Because I'm keying up some scale that deserved it.  That deserved it.  I, I got stuck watching. 
[01:12:30]  Kiss my junk.  I want to be a millionaire.  You watched I want a million, a millionaire?  Gelman.  It's like crack, though.  I don't know why I want to watch that.  Is that your final end?  It's the stupidest show on TV, but I watch it every time I'm flipping around.  Yeah, but you want to know something?  If I was on that show and he lets you make that phone call, I wouldn't call anyone I know.  Because they're idiots.  If I, if I called you, first of all, I couldn't get through because of your phone system, man.  Joe Navarro has an easier time delivering a message than calling this guy. 
[01:13:00]  The party's not accepting messages.  Please, face Mecca.  Light the blanket.  Let the smoke signals rise and he'll get to you by the power of your intention.  How badly do you want to speak to him?  Yeah, that is true, Ant.  Is it?  Yeah.  I never try to call me.  Oh, it kills me.  Yeah, you should.  It kills me because we have decisions in making stuff and now Ant is like, you just didn't get a hold of him.  Oh, come on.  Oh, come on.  My phone, it's right here.  You don't, you don't turn it on, though.  You don't turn it on. 
[01:13:30]  Maybe there's a message on here.  Yeah.  There's probably a few.  All that message is in flash, Anthony.  Lucky Lindy made it.  The French go wild.  Dough boys, hit Europe.  Now, come on.  Babe hits home run, saves off his life.  X-Tree, X-Tree.  X-Tree, X-Tree.  I would use a fake.  I would use a fake.  It takes, you know, how bad could it be?  It comes on, it says, you have a voicemail. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, it's horrible.  You have like a six-hour delay.  Yeah.  If we want to like try to make plans with you for dinner, we better call it like 10 in the morning.  I called you to get a beer and shoot pool in 1974.  I just got that one.  I know.  I remember it.  How funny is it to see Anthony with technology, though?  Oh, he always had technology.  Now, he had, you were on the internet.  You had the AP wire into that, was the apartment we used to, remember the honeycomb hideout?  Yeah.  Well, he had an AP wire hooked in that he got into, like, 10 in the morning. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, really?  Well, I had, what I had was my Commodore 64 computer hooked up to my black and white television.  Right.  And I was online with a 300-baud motor.  Yeah.  Not megabaud, people.  Not kilobaud.  I'm talking 300-baud.  That was it.  Yeah.  And I used to go to these chat rooms and play a trivia.  Yeah.  And the question would come up.  I'd type it in, a sentence in text.  One sentence text would take, like, a minute to transmit over. 
[01:15:00]  And we were sitting there mesmerized.  You know what it was like?  I'm online.  It was like we were terrorists, because we had all this technology and in a hovel.  You know what?  Yeah.  We had, like...  And you didn't have enough rent money, right?  No, and we just didn't have the rent money.  There was no rent money.  The place was falling down.  I remember that.  It was like I had to come up with money for rent or go to Toys R Us and buy a Commodore 64.  So we're online.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Trying to hide from the landlord.  The landlord.  He used to come banging on the door. 
[01:15:30]  And hide.  Yeah, hide.  And hide.  And Adam's like, your car's outside, you idiot.  Where are you going to hide?  I'm out.  Hide.  Don't say anything.  Tell him I'm not here.  He'll go away.  He always goes away.  It's like I'm a squatter.  He's like...  He was funny, because every time the landlord would knock on the door, he's like, Elmer Fudd,  play dead.  He won't hurt you if he thinks you're dead.  And he was like, this big bear came sniffing around, and Anthony's just sitting there like  a corpse.  Pesky landlord.  What does he want now?  Money?  How dare him? 
[01:16:00]  And then we can give it to him after a while.  Go in the hole in the sheetrock.  He doesn't check the walls.  You know, it was easy for him, because since we never paid him, we never asked him to do  anything.  Right.  Because we never wanted him there.  So, you know, if there was a hole in the wall or something, or a leak, who cares?  He made it work for you.  We'll live with it.  We'll live with it.  We'll live with it.  Oh, yeah.  That is funny.  We live with a lot.  It was like those bullet holes from the BB gun.  That was from us.  Yeah.  We were shooting the wall.  They were self-induced. 
[01:16:30]  It's like, oh, my God.  There's bullet holes in the wall.  Oh, that was us.  Yeah.  You have to check out your new rifles when you buy them.  You can't be bothered with driving down to the range.  You just blow off a few into the wall.  Guns don't kill people.  Anthony kills people.  I don't think I've ever killed anything.  You've named, and I have the scar to prove it.  Hey, Dave.  You're next on the show.  What's up?  Hey, boys.  Great hour, first of all.  It's as funny as hell.  Having fun with my pal.  I've got one of the sickest go-go stories ever. 
[01:17:00]  I used to bounce at a bar in Central Jersey.  I'm sitting by the door one day, and this lady comes in.  Now, she looks about 50 years old, but she could have been 100 years old.  All disheveled.  She's carrying this little bag, and she comes over to me, and she's like, I'm here for my audition.  Oh, God.  I'm like, wait a minute.  Do you have the right place here?  Look what kind of bar this is.  So she's like, oh, yeah, I set this up with the manager.  So I show her where to go get changed. 
[01:17:30]  She comes in about 15 minutes later.  She's got this long, black-like sundress on.  So I say to her, I'm like, you know, I hope you're losing that once you get up on stage.  And as I'm looking at her, I'm really thinking, well, I hope you really don't lose this when you get up on stage.  So she gets up on stage.  She dances around for a while.  All of a sudden, the sundress comes off, and all I hear is just groans from these guys at the end of the bar.  I get up.  I walk down the other end.  I look at her.  First of all, the belly's hanging over this little pink bikini that she's got on. 
[01:18:00]  Man, tell me more.  And she's got pantyhose on, which right there I'm going, holy Christ.  And then this guy goes, oh, my God, it's her time of the month.  Look at the size of that pad that she's got on.  Exactly.  I never saw guys clear out of a bar quicker in my whole life.  I'm like, lady, you've got to get off the stage right now.  You're killing business, man.  Oh, man.  That's funny.  I wonder why they hired her.  It was frightening, guys.  All right, Dave, thank you. 
[01:18:30]  See you, guys.  All right, let's go to Luke.  That's what it was also.  I've got to say, the term is tuned up.  Tuned up.  Not keyed up.  Okay.  The cops tuned him up.  Tuned up.  What the hell?  It was a little rough.  We tuned him up.  We tuned him up a little.  Tuned up.  They needed a tune up.  What'd you do?  I had to go out and tune up a scale.  Tell me how to do my job.  There's a retired cop in the line.  John, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  That's exactly what we were just talking about.  You know, with a guy, we used to give him an option.  We used to take him out of the back.  So you want to tune him up or, you know, you can take him and write you up. 
[01:19:00]  One or the other.  Tune up or write up?  That was it.  So when you tune him up, what did that entail?  Smack him around a little bit just so he saw your point of view a little bit better than  he had before you picked him up.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  You know, you can't do it now because they got the frigging cameras all over the place.  Yeah.  You know, between photographing the cars going through the intersections and everything else.  Yeah, and then there's video cameras.  They got them in the cars.  Yeah.  Now, did you ever have to change somebody's mind or way of thinking? 
[01:19:30]  Of course.  Yeah, a couple of tune-ups in your day?  It was a lot easier in the early 70s.  Let me put it that way.  Yeah, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But, you know, these guys didn't respect.  That's exactly what the whole show was about.  You're talking about the COVID, right?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Why?  Come on.  I'm kidding.  Jesus Christ.  You've got to make a joke.  Yeah, he didn't respect the band or anybody else.  That's what it boils down to.  Adam's horrified. 
[01:20:00]  I would hit him, too.  I don't care.  All right, John.  All right.  Take care.  Thank you.  He says the early 70s.  That was a term I used back then.  Not the 1870s.  What was that?  Good Google-a-moo.  It's the opposite.  What the hell was that?  The early 70s.  I had to tune up chicken, Joe.  Hey, Luke, you're next on WNW.  Hello.  Hey, you're up, Luke.  All right.  I just want to tell you guys a quick story. 
[01:20:30]  There's a deli up in Middletown that is a topless deli.  Mm.  Ugh.  A topless deli?  Yeah, it's the strangest thing in the world.  I was up there with a friend of mine.  I was helping him out doing some work, and we were just driving around seeing what's going on.  You know, stop to get a soda or whatever.  And we go into this place to get, like, a sandwich and stuff.  And we look in the back, and there's this back room, and there's this chick dancing around,  and this guy sitting down at the table eating a sandwich.  Oh, God.  Some things don't mix, right?  Yeah, it was real wrong.  I don't know.  It was weird.  I'm not familiar.  I don't really know exactly where it is. 
[01:21:00]  It was, like, pretty much in the middle of nowhere up there.  But I don't know if they put it out.  How did she slice the ham?  What's that?  Aw.  Or the pepperoni.  Well, the pepperoni.  Yeah, there you go.  How do you get over the slicer if you're topless?  Yeah, really?  It was like a cutout.  Like, there was, like, a separate room just for that, and the back was weird.  Oh, it was deli and dancing?  Yeah, pretty much.  Like a bodega.  That's great.  All right, Luke.  All right, thanks.  Thank you.  Yeah, I never even went for, like, you walk into some of these strip clubs,  and they got the big hero, you know, the big 10-foot hero or something. 
[01:21:30]  I didn't even want to go over there.  You know, they had to bring it through the back door, you know, that.  What else is happening in that back room?  Imagine just biting into it all of a sudden.  Oh, a condom.  All right.  It's like that Little Rassels episode with the cake, when a hairbrush was...  Wee, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw, raw.  I like my brush.  My brush.  I got a doorknob. 
[01:22:00]  Mouse trap on the lip.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Wee, wee, wee, wee, raw.  Let's take a break, guys.  Adam Farrar in the studio helping us out today.  My body.  My body, but I ain't going to choke Simon.  Adam playing Governors Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Call Governors for ticket info, okay?  Right.  O.B. Sanford.  O.B. Sanford.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[01:22:30]  2-7-W-N-E-W.  You're on the air.  You're on the air.  You're on the air.  I saw that one over the holiday.  Honeymooners marathon.  I'm listening, Norton.  You're on the air.  I'm sorry, Rob.  Oh, buddy, come.  We're the old buddy, come.  When, uh, and then people were calling up.  I guess it was on Channel 11.  What?  They were all pissed off.  Because, what the hell is that?  Is there a tune playing?  Oh, is it that one?  I was just hearing the beat, and then the rest of the song comes in.  No, I kicked in.  I'm sorry. 
[01:23:00]  Go ahead.  Channel 11 was playing the Honeymooners marathon over the New Year's Eve holiday, and  all of a sudden, Saturday morning comes, 8 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the morning, they  switch to, like, Pokemon.  Pokemon.  That would piss off a lot of people.  And the listing in the paper and stuff said it was going to be a marathon, all the way until  6 o'clock on Saturday night.  Right.  But they know they can make all kinds of money by putting the Pokemon on from all the commercials  that they run.  Right.  So, they totally took the Honeymooners off until noon, and they put them back on. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, people calling up?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  You know Honeymooners fans.  Yeah.  What are you doing with Pokemon?  Norton.  It's this wise guy, you know, Wisenheimer.  Cranmas.  Distinguished mystery meat appetizers.  Uh, we're off.  What's up, uh, Pokemon?  I don't know, Norton.  That is not like the entertainers in mind.  Remember Tommy Shaw and his toy piano?  Little Jack Little?  Basil Fonine?  Who was in the movie they were watching? 
[01:24:00]  What?  The three guys?  Jane Frazee, Buddy Epson.  Jane Frazee?  Yeah, and Buddy Epson.  Yeah.  You guys did watch a lot of TV.  Oh, I don't remember that one.  That was the one with the TV thing.  Captain Video.  Video Rangers.  Captain Video.  Moving around the room.  Stereo.  We had, oh, we had a coat.  So I go on a date and I set up Jimbo.  We got another friend, Jimbo. 
[01:24:30]  We set him up on his blind date.  And it was the girl I was seeing at the time, her friend.  And I go, look, just give me a signal if you don't like this girl.  So we're sitting out at dinner.  And in the middle of a conversation, he stands up and goes, oh, it sure looks like rain tonight.  Wow.  They used to have some funny stuff on that show that, like, you couldn't even get away with now.  Yeah.  Like with Garrity.  Remember when Garrity was mouthing off to Cramden?  Yeah.  Cramden.  Ralph Cramden sticks his head out the window and goes, home a little early tonight, Garrity. 
[01:25:00]  Would the saloon burn down?  You go to them strip clubs during the day, aren't you?  You're lazy, Garrity.  Hey, Ralph, mind if I smoke?  I don't care if you burn.  We'd watch him for hours.  The apartment was, I swear to God, Pee-wee's Playhouse.  Toys, TV, and beer.  A guy wants to talk like Ralph for you guys.  Glenn. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  You're on the air, man.  How depressing.  We don't need a telephone, Alice.  Get a thing out.  If you don't have a motorboat with three propellers, I'll go somewhere else.  He'll never figure it out.  No.  We're on a 40-second delay, so he doesn't believe when we say you're on the air.  You're on the air.  No, I'm not.  I'm not too busy listening to the show in the background.  I listen.  Ant, the market is closed.  Oh, got to get our numbers.  Got to check our stats.  Don't, just don't say what stock you have, Opie. 
[01:26:00]  Okay.  I don't know if there's some kind of conflict in there.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Did you make any money today?  I'm looking on the stock market.  Well, the problem is, like, right at 4 o'clock, between, like, 4 and 4.15 every day,  I believe everyone pounds E-Trade to see how they did to get their numbers.  Well, you're still going to get a 20-minute delayed price on there.  Yeah, that's true, too.  Because the market closed, what, 13 minutes ago?  13 minutes ago.  Are you a big-time trader there, Adam?  Yeah, I got a Bobby Mercer rookie quote. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, well.  How'd you do?  I can't get any quotes.  You can't get on?  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  Up one and an A today.  Thank you.  Which, not which stock, but which, what does it start with?  A.  Okay.  That's good for us, right?  All right.  You sold all that, though, didn't you?  No, I didn't sell all of it.  Okay.  Are you kidding?  This is Wall Street.  Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel.  I, up a quarter, Ant?  Yeah.  Very good. 
[01:27:00]  And my ace in the hole.  Come on, baby.  Rolling the dice with this one.  Penny stock.  Come on.  Oof.  Would you take a hit?  Nah, the 16th.  No big deal.  Oh, God.  I'm down three and three quarters.  On what?  Uh, my one that starts with an A.  Merger.  Shut up.  Shut up.  God, it's got to go back up.  Baltic Avenue?  I'll buy that.  Yeah, I steer clear of the boardwalk and park place.  Type stocks. 
[01:27:30]  Hey, Adam, you ever see the St. James, New York, free parking?  Did you ever think you'd see the day where you'd see your buddy trading like this?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Are you kidding me?  High finance.  Easy come, easy go.  I had it and I went with it.  I went with it.  It was a mere bag of shells.  I got to tell you what happened yesterday.  Wow.  We had this girl that just is a heavy, heavy topic, talking about racism, screaming and  yelling, and I'm fighting back with her and stuff.  And I look over to Ann for some moral support, right?  And also I go, oh, no, he's not even listening. 
[01:28:00]  You felt like a chick, didn't you?  I was like, oh, he's not paying attention.  It turns out he's like, he's just wheeling and dealing and trading during the radio show.  Like in the middle of the show yesterday, thousands of shares going back and forth.  Oh, I'm trading online here.  He's like Gomez Adams.  Now, now, now.  Heavy action yesterday, and I'm like just, you know, fighting for the team.  And I'm like, oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I don't even think he's paying attention.  I don't even think he's paying attention. 
[01:28:30]  I'm like, I don't even think he knows he's here.  Well, I noticed he took the toys away from me.  He only has choice sound effects now.  Yeah.  He's got all my goodies.  He's got his stuff.  I'm going to invest in wacky horns.  See, before we did a talk show, though, we could do all that stupid stuff, like drink beers,  go to the bathroom, trade online while the music was playing.  Now, we don't have it.  Now, we've got to do it during the show while we're talking.  Right.  I have things to do.  Oh, he's got to open up an E-Trade account.  No, that's what scares me.  I like going through, you know, a broker and stuff.  Going through the broker? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, because you can think about it a little bit.  I don't know.  Those online accounts are scary, man.  You have a hunch, and you wish you had it back.  You've got to be quick.  At the bank machine, like, they've got to ask me more questions.  Just to get your cash.  Like, what account and how much.  Do you really need this?  You've been drinking.  How long have you been playing, Blackjack?  Go back to the room.  Craps today, Adam?  Yeah.  I see we're at the dice table again. 
[01:29:30]  I need my mother's voice.  My mother bought me an answer machine.  Yeah.  And you know what I want to talk to you?  Beep.  11.42.  That little tramp Stephanie called.  Don't call her that.  Joseph called.  He's on the drugs again.  Don't call him back.  Have you been to Atlantic City lately?  Not since the last time you came down to see me play there.  Goddamn.  I couldn't believe that.  That was fun.  We all go down to Atlantic City to see our pal Adam.  I'm playing the Tropicana.  He's playing the Tropicana. 
[01:30:00]  The Tropicana.  In Atlantic City.  Now, what do you think?  You're thinking, my pal.  He made it.  He's playing the Tropicana.  He made it.  That's the Tropicana.  I'm thinking Hospitaliana.  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  Hospitaliana.  I understand, but I'm thinking it.  So, he's like, come on.  I got a room.  You don't have to worry about a room.  I got each, everything.  Everything's taken care of.  You just get your ass down here.  Everything will be taken care of.  I'm like.  We're taking a whole crowd of you girls out to the Hong Kong Gardens.  Hong Kong Gardens. 
[01:30:30]  So, I'm like, this is great.  My pal Adam made it.  He's in Atlantic City, the Tropicana.  You know, Jesus Christ.  We go down there.  It was a lot.  It was you, your brother, foot, the girls.  I'm like, let's go to the Tromp.  Oh, well, we can't go there for the room.  Well, why?  Well, I'm not staying at the Tromp.  Well, you're playing the Tromp.  Yeah, but I'm not playing the big room.  No, no, no, no.  I was playing the con.  I wasn't staying at the Tromp.  Remember, I had to call my father?  That's what I mean.  He's staying at some little fleabag hotel.  They put you up, like, across the street, like the room where they keep the patio furniture. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  I'm like, let me see.  The bed comes out of the wall.  It was like the bed came out of the wall, and I wasn't heavy enough to keep it down.  It's true.  I slept with my head at the wrong end, so I would, like, inhale, and the bed would come up.  I would exhale.  It was a cartoon.  I would inhale.  The bed comes up.  Exhale.  Oh, I'm all bummed out.  I got your free eats, though, didn't I?  Yeah.  Then I'm figuring, okay, well, at least we'll go to the Tromp and get something to eat.  He gives me these vouchers that were expired for food, and he goes, look, we're going to 
[01:31:30]  go into the kitchen, directly into the kitchen, and just grab the food.  He goes, it's okay.  All the help does this.  I go, I'm not the help.  He goes, just don't let them know that.  He goes, walk in.  Walk to the food.  Do not make eye contact.  With anybody.  If anyone asks who you are, you're, do you remember the name of the band?  You're with the band.  Oh, yeah.  Sonny Blue and the Sky Notes or something?  Sonny Blue and the Sky Notes.  He goes, tell him you're with Sonny Blue and the Sky Notes. 
[01:32:00]  He looks like a Sky Note.  Come on.  Yeah, so I'm grabbing my food.  I want to cover myself.  I'm just going, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bang, da, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  You know, people look at me going, he must be with Sonny Blue and his Sky Notes.  He's the base.  I grab like I was foraging, like it was a care package dropped in Afghanistan or something.  I just grab a roll and some butter and run away.  You know what it was like?  It was like that supermarket show where you've got to get the food because you're under a time control. 
[01:32:30]  Yes, supermarket suite.  I'm just grabbing stuff and then ran out of there waiting for security to grab me and take me out of there.  So that was the food portion of it.  And then he's not playing the big rule.  Well, I was starting out.  I know.  You didn't tell us that.  You wouldn't have come down.  I know.  So then we went to the casino and gambled away all night, 20 bucks that we had.  No, we played all night.  Yeah, we did.  We were winning.  We had a heart attack because Joe Buck was playing $25 a hand.  We were all standing behind him.  And he had like welts on his face. 
[01:33:00]  He was breaking out in hives and sweating.  He's like, you know, he's got a $50 bet out.  He doubles down.  You know, he's like, oh.  And, you know, we're broke.  We had a $25 chip to us.  It was like, oh.  It was like the courtroom drop.  It's a green chip.  It's a green chip.  It's a green chip.  It's a green chip.  Oh, my God.  It's a green chip.  Joe Buck's going to need a lot of weed when he gets back to the room.  Yeah.  It was like it.  This one's for Birdie.  Everyone.  It's the A-team.  The Masters champion. 
[01:33:30]  He's got the green.  He's drawn a 15.  This is what men are made of.  Yeah.  Dealer showing a two.  And not flinching.  Should he hit?  How long did it take before he lost all his money?  No.  He actually walked away winning.  He actually walked away, huh?  We were playing that goofy game, Red Dog.  Red Dog, which is A.C. Doocy.  A.C. Doocy.  And we all know how small the pots get on A.C. Doocy.  Bet the pot.  Bet the pot.  When you play at home.  That is the.  Every time I have a poker game with you clowns. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  It all starts out fun and games.  Quarter max.  You know.  Nickel dime.  And we'll do it this way.  But.  After about an hour.  An hour and a half of drinking beer.  All right.  A.C. Doocy.  No limit.  Yeah.  Put your cars on the line.  I bet a kidney.  I've given all kinds of things.  And then it's like.  Okay.  Ace.  Deuce.  Now you know the object of the game.  You've got to get in between the cards that are drawn.  So if you've got a deuce and an ace.  The ace is high.  The only thing that could F you is an ace or a deuce.  Sure. 
[01:34:30]  And if you pull an ace or a deuce.  When you have ace and deuce out.  You've got to pay double the pot.  Double the pot.  Pot.  Ace.  Wah!  We're dying laughing.  And the guy that just screwed up has to go in.  I remember someone signing a paycheck over.  It was fun.  Yeah.  Signing a paycheck over.  Mm-hmm.  To the pot.  And then everyone's scared to hit pot.  Yeah.  Pot.  That's funny.  All right.  Ant.  There's a guy on hold.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Hold on.  Let me tell Bobby to stay there.  Bobby. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  We're going to you next.  All right?  All right, bro.  Just got to take a quick break.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  Bobby has a story.  About a 50-year-old stripper in.  And if you have something for the show, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Sometimes you feel like a neck.  Booty dooty.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Booty and Anthony.  Booty and Anthony.  1027-WNAW.  1027-WNAW.  It's Booty and Anthony and Adam Farrar. 
[01:35:30]  We've got to go to Bobby's story on Line 9, right, guys?  Oh, yeah.  Bobby!  Bobby, you're next on NAW.  How you doing?  How you doing?  I'm doing good.  All right.  Hey, listen.  I'm a fine man in the city, right?  And once a year, we have these, like, a retirement party.  You know, guys retire.  They get made.  They get promoted.  They leave the house.  So we get a volunteer house out on the Long Island, and we have a party.  And I handle all the food, and I tell this one guy, listen, get some entertainment. 
[01:36:00]  So what he does, he gets these girls.  They're the shankiest things I've ever seen in my life.  I mean, they're popping up, ping-pong balls, you name it, you know.  But the best was they had this 50-year-old woman, and she's, guys?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're waiting.  Oh, oh.  I thought I lost you.  I'm on the call for them.  No.  They have this 50-year-old woman come, right?  I mean, she had more baggage.  She had a whole bag of tricks. 
[01:36:30]  Next thing I turn around, there's a line going out the bathroom.  Yeah.  That would be 15, 20 guys.  Five bucks a day.  Yeah.  She's doing guys with the bathroom.  She's doing guys.  I got guys coming out asking me for fives.  Hey, you got change?  You got change?  She's doing guys in the bathroom for five bucks?  Five bucks, too.  What the hell's that, Andy?  Oh, my God. 
[01:37:00]  Uh, hello?  Buddy?  Hello?  You still there?  Is that an Apache helicopter?  I believe it was, Anthony.  With a thermal sight?  Poor guy didn't even see it coming, Anthony.  No, not a comment from him.  Wow.  When you listen to this radio show, you're in your car, you got to look in front of you,  to the left, to the right, and above.  You don't know where it's coming from.  A little sneak attack there. 
[01:37:30]  It's coming out of the dash!  Uh, Stu, what's going on?  God, I got to watch out for those choppers, guys.  Yeah, man.  Real quick, uh, you know, born and raised in New Jersey, so, uh, you know, I've been going  to go-go bars my whole life, went down to the University of Maryland to go to college,  met some friends one day at Baltimore.  I don't know if you guys have ever been to Baltimore, any of the go-go bars there, but,  uh, a lot different than New Jersey.  Yeah.  Uh, to make a long story short, we walked in, there's like a 60-year-old midget there.  She comes over.  I swear to God. 
[01:38:00]  A fidget?  Exactly.  A 60-year-old fidget stripper?  Well, this is the thing, you know, comes down, sits next to you, hey, buy me a drink.  Uh, no, no thanks, I'm okay.  No, come on, buy me a drink, I'll keep you company.  Uh, no, it's okay.  What do you want, a sarsaparilla?  Yeah, okay, okay, so I'll take a glass of wine.  Yeah, that'll be $20.  I was like, yeah, for $20, uh, you better keep me interested over here.  A 60-year-old midget ball.  That's interesting.  Jesus.  It is, you know, it's weird, like I said, you grow up in Jersey, you know, it's, you know,  if they serve liquor, they can only be, you know, topless, or if it's a juice bar, they 
[01:38:30]  can do certain things.  Yeah.  Yeah, you go to another state, you don't know what the deal is, and, uh, to make a long story short,  this place was definitely servicing people in the back, you know.  We'd like to buy a bottle of champagne for $60, uh, you know, the wet room, or whatever  it was called, the bubble room.  The champagne room.  The champagne room.  Exactly, the champagne room, and, uh, you know, she's, like, trying to set us up to meet  her 16-year-old friend after hours, and, uh, to try to impress me, she told me she could  stick a...  What, is this guy on a record album? 
[01:39:00]  Sounds like one of my old, uh...  Yeah.  I got lied.  Needleburn.  The job impressed me, she told me she could, uh, put a cigarette you-know-where, break it  off at the bus.  Wow.  All right.  So, yeah.  Well, 60-year-old, what kind of...  What do you...  Well, I guess, what do you do after the service?  You know what it was?  The guy, the guy up front was like, uh, come on, you know you want to see it, you're  curious.  Yeah, I would check that out.  And he was right.  Sure, I would check that out.  There you go.  Thank, thank you, Stu.  Hey, great, great job, guys.  Take care.  Bye-bye.  That's the tent at the carnival? 
[01:39:30]  You know, that little tent where all the freaks are?  Oh, I used to love that growing up.  The freak show.  I saw Coliseum when the circus came to town.  They just don't have the freak shows anymore.  What a 60-year-old midget.  What about the guy that discovered her?  Getting on the phone, getting Klondike 444429.  Hello, Siegfried.  You're not going to believe this.  That Klondike one.  I love the references.  Give me Butterfield 666628.  Stop the presses.  Hey, Billy.  Hey, hey, guys, man.  That was funny.  Is that a helicopter?  No.  I wanted to say it so bad, I started cracking up when I heard it coming. 
[01:40:00]  That's our new one, Mish.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Definitely.  Well, I thought it was funny.  Keep it on the cutesy, Mish.  Hey, yo, me and my cousin were in a strip club in Alaska.  Wow.  The Northern Exposure Showgirls.  What do the girls look like there?  Oh, they're horrible.  Forget about it.  The girl's dancing, and she's, like, talking to us at the same time.  I hate that.  Oh, don't you?  I don't even want to make eye contact with them.  Man.  You know?  What about you get the lap dance, right?  Yeah.  And they have small talk?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:40:30]  Because they're waiting for the...  Well, the girl in Alaska, she's like, I'm just working here until I fix my transmission  in my truck.  Right.  Hello.  This other girl, she's meowing and stuff and just wanted to shut up.  Yeah.  But the funny thing is, there's a bunch of freaks around there, you know?  And it was my cousin's first time in the strip club.  I'd only been, like, once before.  And the girl comes up to him, and he's got a dollar bill.  He's all anxious to put it in.  And she comes up, and she sticks it in his mouth.  And she grabs the back of his head and just takes it out with her inner thighs, you know?  Like, real close.  And my cousin's got this look on his face, you know? 
[01:41:00]  He's so excited.  And I look out around the table there where they're dancing, and every other guy's got  a dollar bill hanging out of their mouth.  It's freaking hilarious.  Hell, yeah.  All right, Billy.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Yeah, I hate the small talk.  Man.  When you set up for the lap dance, and they're waiting for the next song to start.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're giving you a little small talk.  So, where are you from?  Blah, blah, blah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm thinking of going to school.  And I'm thinking of being an actress.  I'm up for a part in an Australian film. 
[01:41:30]  You know, I'm leaving Thursday.  That's real cute, honey.  Take off your clothes, you whore.  I'm going to court reporter school.  I'm going to work a little blackjack right there.  And then the song starts.  Oh, it's a boss.  Right.  And she's moving like she wants to F you like an animal.  Yeah.  The song ends.  It's like, well, thanks.  Thanks.  She's grinding on you like she owes you money.  Oh, it's a boss.  Song's over, and back to Sweet and Innocent.  Back to Humpin'.  All right.  A stripper with no teeth. 
[01:42:00]  Ouch.  Abe.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Great.  Listen, man.  I got the worst story for you, man.  I was in a strip club because I do a lot of traveling.  I was in a strip club in Mississippi.  This old woman comes up to me.  She must have been about 163 years old.  I said 63 years old.  She was about 163, man.  She came up, and she's like, you need some company?  And I was like, no, that's okay, but you can go over to my friend over there.  He loves some company.  She's like, no, but I want to hang out with you.  She smiled at me.  Man, she had nothing but gums in her mouth. 
[01:42:30]  Nothing but gums.  And it's like she looked like her teeth were just freshly pulled before she walked in the door with, like, a pair of pliers.  It was, like, drippy, like, little gummy pieces, like, hanging from her mouth and stuff.  I mean, you know, I tell them again, if somebody's into, like, gum jobs or whatever, man, you can go ahead and get that kind of stuff happening.  My name is Ginger Vitus.  I mean, you know, it's like, oh, it was some of the ugliest stuff that I'd ever seen.  It turned me off for, like, the rest of the night. 
[01:43:00]  But I wanted to go back and just, like, chuck up everything that I had for lunch that day, man.  It was the nastiest.  Very good.  Thank you.  You guys rock, man.  All right, brother.  Be cool.  Bye.  Be cool.  First lady on the show today, I believe.  Real?  We had one earlier.  Stacey, what's up?  Hey, you guys.  How are you?  I was waiting for, hey, no, I'm a guy.  No, this is Stacey, the lactating mom.  You guys remember me?  Stacey, the lactating mom.  Yeah, remember?  I was going to come in and lactate for you guys or told you to have a contest.  You wanted me to come in. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, you blew us off.  Yeah, well, I stopped.  I'm done.  We're still looking for ladies to come in and lactate for us.  And I know you're behind that, aren't you?  I am.  I recently started dating this guy, younger guy.  And we've been going to the bars.  And last weekend, we went to a bar in PA together.  And, you know, he's flipping the girls the dollars.  And they're looking at me, winking at me.  And we go in the back.  We get a lap dance.  And, of course, after we beat the bar, it's the greatest sex ever. 
[01:44:00]  My man got a rusty that night.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Stacey, we weren't paying attention because on line 11, there's a guy that knows a stripper with a bullet hole in her ass.  Stacey, hold on.  We'll continue your story in a second.  Yeah.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  This can't be real.  I swear to God, you know the place, I bet you, too.  It's King Arthur's in Chelsea, Massachusetts.  King Arthur's?  Where were you at that place at?  Oh, I bet you weren't.  We did just about every strip club in Boston and Eric. 
[01:44:30]  Well, none of them are in Boston.  It's Flash a hotel.  Okay.  It's Joint Flash Gambling Parlor, Keno Action.  And she had a bullet hole in her ass?  Well, my friend, we were asking.  She had a pretty bad scar on her ass.  That's nice.  And we got the courage up to ask her.  And sure enough, got shot in the ass by her boyfriend.  But it was an accident.  Swear to God.  That's it, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Wait.  Well, wait. 
[01:45:00]  Did she say why?  No, she said it was an accident.  That's funny.  I was cleaning my ass and it went on.  Thank you, bud.  See ya.  All right.  I'm laughing because she's like three.  Three, three, three.  Oh, you can't say that.  Yeah.  I know.  You cannot put that.  Oh.  Well, let's try.  Is that spelled right?  Let's try.  Is the last word spelled right?  Duncan.  Yo.  You're making us laugh our asses off.  You've got to be careful.  I'm going to try and be as careful as I can. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  Talk in code.  You know all the code words for this radio show, right?  Yes, sir.  I don't know if there's a code word for this.  It's no balloon, knot, or junk kind of situation.  All right.  But I'll do my best.  There used to be this strip joint called The Goat in Hunts Point.  The Goat.  It's called The Goat.  It's called The Goat Bar and Grill.  It closed before you guys got to town.  But all the girls had goatees?  Dude, it was worse than that.  It was so gnarly.  Right.  You're going.  First of all, all they sold were nips of bud for like two bucks. 
[01:46:00]  Lap dances were like $1.50.  For real.  Discount.  Oh.  The discount booby bar.  You got what you paid for.  Two for $2.50.  There was no stage.  All they did was like a regular bar.  You know, you have bottles on one side, bottles on the other.  They took the bottles from one side, and the girl would just stand there.  No lights.  They just have a guy with a flashlight pointing it at her.  So this girl, she looks real high.  You know, you could tell she's stumbling.  She couldn't even make it up there.  She bends over.  They're totally nude.  She bends over. 
[01:46:30]  Her little brown eye is winking at you, and some stuff comes out of it.  Now, I'm out of it.  That's a chip joint.  It was so nasty, dude.  Marathon.  Basically, you wanted to say that.  We can't say it, huh?  It had something to do with a crab.  It was.  It was loosey-goosey.  All right, Duncan.  Thank you.  You got it, brothers.  Jesus.  Oh, this show's going wrong once again. 
[01:47:00]  Tony!  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Great.  Listen, you guys might remember this place.  It was right near the Stonehenge and Brass Monkey.  It was called the Gaslight Lounge.  Ah, the Gaslight Lounge.  Yeah, they had all these round tables, and you'd always lose your beer because the tables  were so shaky.  And one time, a girl steps off the stage onto the table, and the whole table snaps off and 
[01:47:30]  whacks her right in her head, laying there on the floor in the heat.  Real mess.  They were real class joints.  Give her a dollar to do that again.  Yeah.  Thank you, Tony.  All right.  All right, back to Stacey.  All right, Stacey.  Yeah.  What are you laughing at?  Ah, me and my girlfriend were just discussing.  So you guys like going to the bars, huh?  Yeah, we definitely like going to the bars together.  Okay.  I don't think the females have anything to worry about.  And I actually, one of the girls invited me up on the stage, and I did, you know, I 
[01:48:00]  was dressed, but I did a little number for my boy, and he, of course, liked it.  It's a little crazy, but, you know, we have fun.  Ladies should definitely not worry about the go-go bars.  If anything, go with your man.  It turns me on anyway.  I get excited.  You like that, huh?  Oh, yeah.  And definitely the sex better.  It's way better.  When you head home and everything's all good.  All right.  Thank you, Stacey.  All right.  You guys.  Evil thing. 
[01:48:30]  I know that, but you don't like that, don't you?  Yeah.  Hey, Psycho Mark, you heading down to, uh...  Yeah, it was just over there.  I just took a look over there.  What's it looking like?  Just a bunch of fools hanging out in front, waiting for the carpetbagger to show up.  Any, uh, signs or anything?  People have, like, holding signs?  There was one guy walking around with a sign.  He looked very, very angry and, uh, was making all kinds of, uh...  What did the signs say?  I didn't even see.  You gotta get in the face of some, uh, uh, Hillary supporters. 
[01:49:00]  How about you go up with a big sign that just says, Hillary is a C word.  You know?  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  Just marching around with that one.  How long before the Secret Service tackles you?  About ten seconds.  Yeah, probably.  So, you're gonna head down there and get in some trouble, or what?  Well, if we had press passes, I'd be all set.  I'd go right into the thing.  Don't let that stop you.  Yeah, I know.  Why can't we get some from wins?  Let me tell you something.  They don't want to ruin their credibility, really.  I'm sure it's possible.  If a stripper can take a bullet, come on. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, she took one in the ass.  Come on.  Take one for the taste.  Be a man.  Mark takes a bullet for the taste.  Sure, why not?  A walk's as good as a hit.  You're on base.  All right, Mark heading out to see what's going on outside the Letterman studio.  Hillary Clinton.  Thank you, Mark.  Bring the bullhorn.  I'm just gonna haggle.  And bail money.  I'm just gonna sit there and haggle her.  All right, cool.  We'll call soon, because we're taking a break, and we want to go to you real soon.  Hillary!  Hillary!  There's your husband's weenie while you're here.  Do you know where your husband's swan is?  We've got one hot northwest corner. 
[01:50:00]  Northwest corner.  Move in slow.  Don't alarm him.  Glazed over look.  Left eye spinning west.  Right eye spinning east.  The Secret Service might have to borrow our helicopter.  Oh, yeah.  Airstrike in on Psycho Mark.  All right.  Well, get out there, man.  All right.  We'll come up with some things in the same time.  Hillary!  You're a twat!  That's him.  That's the one.  All right, and as we go to break, a couple things real fast. 
[01:50:30]  Steve from the unofficial website, the Anthony website, put up the clip of the couple having  sex at the baseball game.  That is a great clip.  Oh, is that the best or what?  People don't understand when you're at a ballpark, even if the place is empty and you  are in the upper deck and you can't even see a person around you.  The TV cameras can zoom in on the pitcher's pores on his nose as he's pitching the ball.  You think they can't zoom in on what you're doing?  Yeah.  And a camera caught a couple having sex. 
[01:51:00]  Sex!  They were banging up there in the upper deck.  And the guy's looking around like, oh, this is cool.  No one can see me.  No one can see me.  He's sitting in the seat.  The girl's sitting on his lap.  And they are just banging.  And it's all captured on videotape.  George Orwell's looking down going, see?  Told you.  I told you.  See?  You didn't believe me, did you?  Don't listen to me.  You can't even bang your broad at the ballpark.  So now it's for everyone to see all over the world.  It's on the internet.  And Steve put it on the unofficial website.  It's great stuff.  It's a good one.  And real fast, a lot of people are requesting the trailer for The Soul of Nigger Charlie, Anthony. 
[01:51:30]  The Soul of Nigger Charlie.  What is this?  It's a movie from the 70s, one of those blaxploitation films from the 70s,  which are making a huge comeback now.  You know that?  A lot of blacks are seeing these things as part of their culture and everything  and really embracing them now.  Fly.  Yeah.  Things like that.  I was watching Shiba.  Clea Petra Jones.  I was watching Shiba.  Shiba.  Shiba Baby.  Shiba Baby? 
[01:52:00]  It was on Flix.  Shiba Baby.  Right after we were talking about all this.  Well, we want to see A Nigger Charlie Rides Again and The Soul of Nigger Charlie,  which are two movies that came out.  These are real movies from the 70s.  Real movies from the 70s.  And we have the trailer.  And this is the actual trailer.  Should we play it now or do you want to take a break?  No, play it now.  Screw the break.  So let me plug it in.  Okay.  Oh, let me turn that down.  It's a professional radio show for God's sake.  I understand.  It's just like The Apartment.  I'm still plugging things.  Move stuff.  Look at this.  Movie aerial around the room, Ralph. 
[01:52:30]  Bison, where's the stereo?  That's my beer.  Not that one.  That's mine.  This was a clip, like I said, a movie trailer from the 70s.  It's real.  This isn't no baloney.  Who put it out?  What's movie studio?  I don't know.  I think, what was it, Paramount or something, I think they said?  I think they said it.  Black cowboys roamed the plains.  They couldn't read or write, but they sure could ride.  Didn't you?  They were men with souls. 
[01:53:00]  Men like nigger Charlie.  Now he's rise again.  The soul of nigger Charlie.  This time, Charlie's got an army behind him.  A whole damn army.  Silly gold.  Green black brothers is outsmarting and outfighting the entire weapon.  Nigger Charlie's on the loop again.  This time, he's got his soul, brother.  So, watch out.  You, boy.  Nigger Charlie.  Mr. Nigger Charlie. 
[01:53:30]  Mr. Nigger Charlie.  Paramount Pictures presents Beth Williamson and the soul of nigger Charlie.  Rated R. Under 17, not admitted, without parents.  Nigger Charlie, back.  You better watch out.  Now, you're right down to McClendon Tickle.  Can you believe that?  Oh, my God.  That's hysterical.  The Thunderbird driving is the best part of that.  The Thunderbird driving?  Now, you know what that movie's all about.  Uh-huh.  Nigger Charlie and his posse ride into the West and just shoot up Whitey. 
[01:54:00]  You think there's a subject?  To kill Whitey.  I believe that's it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What are we going to do, boss?  Here comes nigger Charlie.  Who's the guy starring?  Nigger Charlie.  I don't even know what his name was.  Really?  Here comes nigger Charlie and his posse riding into town.  What are we going to do, boss?  I'll take care of nigger Charlie.  Oh, my God.  You know?  And I can see it's probably like that.  And then there's probably like the white whore from the whorehouse. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, nigger Charlie.  Right.  You know?  And she's all, you know, yeah.  She's like a nigger on schnitzengroobing.  Please, baby.  I am not from Havana.  Them schnitzengroobings will wear you out, man.  That's hysterical.  We've got to find out who started it.  It was probably the guy who played Bookman on Good Time.  Johnny Brown.  Is that his name?  Johnny Brown.  Johnny Brown.  Yeah.  Pleased nigger Charlie.  Oh, my God. 
[01:55:00]  Is that funny?  But, yeah, it was back in the 70s.  1972.  Yeah, somewhere around there.  Let's take a break.  Hopefully, Psycho Mark will check in in a few minutes from outside the Letterman studio.  Tonight on David Letterman, Hillary Clinton, and nigger Charlie.  Special guest, nigger Charlie.  Jesus, man.  Movie star, nigger Charlie.  It was the 70s, you know.  Hillary Clinton.  More to come.  Adam Farrar in the studio.  Musical guest, the cheese monkey. 
[01:55:30]  Playing Governors Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Call Governors for ticket info.  You guys, some conflict.  Piss me off, okay?  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's Ophian, Anthony.  Hey.  And Adam Farrar.  Sorry, Adam.  Hey.  Adam, hanging today.  Hello.  On the phone, we got Psycho Mark Anthony.  He's outside the Letterman studio.  Big night for Letterman. 
[01:56:00]  Yes, he's got nigger Charlie on time.  Oh, no, he's got Hillary Clinton.  The carpet muncher.  Carpetbagger.  Sorry.  Sorry, Al.  Sorry, Chief.  Sorry.  Sorry about that.  So, he's out there with a megaphone.  We're seeing if he can stir up some trouble today.  Psycho Mark very good at stirring up trouble, Anthony.  Yes, he is.  So, let's see what's going on out there.  Hey, Psycho Mark.  Hey, carpet munchers.  Hey, hold on a sec.  I got a bunch of people here.  They look like all Hillary fans.  Hey, how many people are all the fans of Hillary? 
[01:56:30]  I am.  That's it.  Just one.  We got one Hillary fan.  Listen, I heard that Monica's selling bags around the corner.  Monica's around the corner?  Selling bags.  Monica's selling bags around the corner.  We just found out.  Yeah, that's what she does now.  She sells bags.  She's had so many across her nose.  She knows a lot about bags.  She knows bags.  So, what's the scene out there, Psycho Mark?  All right.  Well, they've got the street all blocked off.  They've got Secret Service agents crawling everywhere.  Not your secret. 
[01:57:00]  No, not at all.  They've got them on buildings.  There's a guy up on a building up on the left.  There's a guy up in a building on the right.  And they are not letting anybody stop right here.  It's like a total cordoned off area.  Who asked the Secret Service?  Where was he at the book suppository building?  That'll get your friends.  Well, I mean, Mark's got a couple hundred people around him,  and we're trying to figure out something cool they could all chant.  I don't know.  People, they kind of seem sort of stupefied here today.  They're like,  That's the nerve gas that the Secret Service let out. 
[01:57:30]  I'm not one for conspiracy theories, but I know they do that.  Conform.  If any of our listeners have an idea, give us a call.  Conform.  Get rid of all the stripper phone calls.  Keep the nigga Charlie calls.  And see if anyone comes up with a chant for a second.  A little chant.  I'm on the phone here, okay?  Something about our first lady, Hillary Clinton.  How close is the Secret Service from you?  They are standing right in front of me.  There's about, I'd say, about 15 agents all surrounding the block.  They're not letting anybody walk in front of... 
[01:58:00]  Why don't you start, take the megaphone and just start...  Ask him his name.  Can we see your peace?  Oh, my God.  I'm not kidding.  Can we see your peace?  Hey, can we see your peace?  Hey, you're nuts.  Did you see when Reagan got shot, all of a sudden the Secret Service guys had like handheld howitzers.  That's right.  They came out of their jackets and stuff.  One guy had a gun.  I swear to God, it was some kind of machine gun I've never seen in my life.  Huge.  And he was keeping it. 
[01:58:30]  He was like in short-sleeved shirt and shorts.  All of a sudden, he pulled it out of somewhere.  You've got to watch them guys, Mark.  Hey, the Secret Service just came over to me and they asked me if I'm going to be using the bullhorn.  Uh-oh.  They probably put me with a missile inside the thing.  So, you know what you do?  You go right in his face and through the bullhorn and go, no!  Go right in his face and go, what?  No, no.  The guy's like six foot five and he's black and I'm not dead.  And he's black.  That's nigger's plan. 
[01:59:00]  Law and order.  Defending the first lady.  Hey, want me to see if he starred in the movie?  Yeah.  Oh, that'll get you killed.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Hey, have you ever seen the movie?  Oh, never mind.  Mark, hold on a sec.  Someone's very pissed at us.  Hold on.  We'll go right back to you.  What do we do?  Uh, Richard.  Hello.  Hi.  Hey, Dick.  What's up, man?  Uh, how you doing?  Um, you just have no respect.  I mean, this is a fellow New Yorker.  Don't curse.  Come on.  Why are you cursing?  Now he hangs up.  What a puss. 
[01:59:30]  We ran out of delay, so we had to get rid of Mr. Head.  If people want to, uh, you know, bitch about us, we don't care.  We'll put you on the air.  But for God's sake, you can't curse.  Hillary sucks.  Monica blows.  They're trying to think of a real good chance for Mark to start out there.  Whip him out.  Um, it is whip him out Wednesday.  You guys are getting some good phone calls there, huh?  Yeah.  Hey, Mark, what's up?  Nothing.  I'm standing right here.  The Secret Service is standing right in front of my face.  Ah, really? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, they're right here.  What's the secret?  What's the guy's name?  I don't know.  But here she comes.  She's coming right now.  Here, get the sign out, Earl.  I got Earl with me here.  What sign you got?  I got the big wild sign.  Come on, Earl.  Oh, I thought you had Hillary as a...  Hey, Hillary!  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Look at the seat.  Now they're going to get mad at me.  This guy just pointed at me.  Say, hey, Hillary.  Where's Bill Schlong?  Hey, where's Bill?  Oh, I'm getting lots of nasty looks. 
[02:00:30]  Look at the puppy in jail.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Show me your fun bags!  Show me your fun bags.  Oh, God, I'm going to get out of the ocean.  Oh, my God!  Oh, that's it.  She's already gone inside.  That was two seconds.  That was that fast.  That was it.  That was barely enough time for anyone to squeeze off a shot.  How could you miss?  I'd see Rudy.  Damn it, I had her right in my crosshairs. 
[02:01:00]  I did one peep with this bullhorn, and that was it.  I was just about to get a bead on me with her 9mm.  Hillary.  You know there was some guy on the show.  Hillary shows your fun bags.  I'm screwed.  Because he's politically active.  Now we can cross the street.  Fun bags for peace.  That's it, huh?  Look at the missiles.  That was it, dude.  But it was like a five-second deal.  She came.  She just went.  She gave her a cheesy little smile. 
[02:01:30]  She sort of flashed one of her cans, and then went right in.  What, did she get out of the limo and stuff?  No, they got some stupid van.  It kind of looks like the AEW van, except it's a little bit nicer.  It's probably armor-plated, man.  There's no armor on that thing.  I could spit on it and break a window.  You're good.  Something's just an electric field.  Don wants you to chant, I want a cigar.  I want a cigar!  I want a cigar! 
[02:02:00]  I want a cigar!  Are there still people there?  Yeah, they're just staring at me.  It's like a retarded.  There's some guy yelling down the street over here.  He's got a sign, and he's screaming obscenities.  All right, go to him.  Let's see what's going on.  I'm going to go find out.  This guy looks really sick.  All right, that's what we want.  Get ready on the dump.  Yeah, get ready for the dump, Todd.  All right.  What do you think about Hillary? 
[02:02:30]  It paws up.  It paws up.  It paws up.  What?  What's your name?  I'm telling you.  He's not telling me.  All right, ask him what he's there for.  What are you here for today?  Goodbye.  Goodbye, he said.  That sounds come out of his head.  He's got one of those little stupid horns.  Yeah. 
[02:03:00]  He's got that, and the Secret Service is yelling at you.  Yeah, really?  I can't believe I'm on it.  Hey, what do you think about Hillary Clinton?  Oh, I don't want to talk to you.  That's not.  There you go.  Follow him.  Wait, get right in his face.  Talk to him through the bullhorn.  It's nut wars.  He's going to cut my horn off?  What did he say?  He's going to cut off my...  All right, we say...  Mark, Mark. 
[02:03:30]  Mark.  Tell him through the bullhorn that the UFOs know where he is.  Hey, the UFOs know who you are.  They're coming for you.  Get them all paranoid.  Yeah.  Hey, watch out.  The UFOs are coming for you.  They're coming.  I can see them right now.  They're flying over your horn.  You're all kind of the bullhorn.  We're like doing it with the horns.  Blank bagels! 
[02:04:00]  Blank bagels!  What is he saying?  What's he babbling about?  I don't know.  He's talking.  I'm going to cut your pussy off and stuff like that.  It's horrible.  He's drunk.  He's completely drunk out of his mind.  Ugh.  Anyhow.  I'm going to get back over and see what the rest of the goons here are going.  All right, man.  We've got to take a quick break, Mark.  All right.  If anything happens, give us a call back, all right?  All right.  Well, you know what I'm going to try and do? 
[02:04:30]  There's some TV news crews down here.  Me and Earl got the big wild sign.  So we're going to try and get on TV and mess up some newscasts.  Oh, get the bullhorn ready when they go live?  Oh, yeah.  What do you want me to say?  What channels are out there?  They've got Channel 2, Channels, you know, all the channels are here.  Fox News, everybody.  All right.  Well, when they go live, get the megaphone and just start chanting Whippin' Mount Wednesday  or something, all right?  All right.  All right.  We'll check in with you in a bit.  All right, guys.  All right.  There you go.  Psycho Mark, everyone.  Jesus. 
[02:05:00]  He was able to scream, show us your fun bags, before Hillary made it into the Letterman  studio.  Show us your fun bags.  All right, Rep.  We'll be back.  Opie, Opie, Opie, Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  1027, WNEW.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, it's Adam Farrar.  He's got bail money.  Well, Psycho Mark's back on the line. 
[02:05:30]  Lots going on.  Mark?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up?  I'm standing right here in front of the CBS store, and they've got camera crews all the  way up and down the street.  Yeah.  And unfortunately, they spotted me.  I'm the only guy walking around with a bullhorn, so it's not too hard to miss me.  What, the Secret Service came up to you?  Yeah, the Secret Service came right up to me.  They were pissed.  They were pissed.  They did not like the fun bags comment. 
[02:06:00]  That was a little out there.  What about the news?  Yeah, what about the news?  What about the news?  Yeah.  Yeah, the news crew's on, too?  I'm waiting for Channel 2.  They're about to go up right within the next 10 minutes.  I'm waiting for Earl to signal me, but he's busy looking at some chicks, so I'm not going  to get a signal from him.  Okay.  But I'm waiting for her to go up and do live, and then I'm just going to flash my big wild  time.  Oh, that's cool.  We'll be watching.  Yeah, we're watching as you speak, Mark.  As the world turns. 
[02:06:30]  Stephen Clark is talking, talking, he's talking, he's talking.  Crime Stoppers, 1-800-577-TIPS.  All right, stay on the line.  We're going to go to you as soon as we know you're on TV there.  Yeah, as soon as you know I'm on TV, I'll do a nutty.  All right, hold on.  We'll check in with you in a couple seconds here.  All right, keep going home.  All right.  No, that seems to be a bus accident.  Almost like the train wreck.  Yeah, you've got to get your eyes checked out. 
[02:07:00]  You've got me over here on the other side of the console.  What the kids say.  Yeah, that looks like a psychopath with a bullhorn.  It's a bus.  It's a tanker truck.  It's a tanker truck.  Chris, what's going on?  I'm so ready.  What's the deal?  Not much.  Okay, anyway, I saw when you guys were talking like two days ago about the Legend of Nigger  Charlie, and that first came up with the clip from the Internet.  Because I Have No Life, I ran right out and got it at Kim's Video in Manhattan.  Right.  They got all this stuff.  All right. 
[02:07:30]  I took it home.  I watched it.  It's the greatest black Western I've ever seen in my entire life.  Really?  Yeah, we're looking forward to checking out that movie for ourselves.  What's up?  Go ahead.  You liked the movie, You Laughed, yeah?  I laughed.  I cried.  And I have a good feeling about me.  I laughed.  I cried.  Listen to you.  And there was brief nudity in it, and I just felt like kind of like just really African afterwards.  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  All right.  Chris.  Thank you, Chris.  Stay tuned.  All right.  Bye. 
[02:08:00]  So the film does exist.  Yeah, we're very distracted.  Mark.  Yeah.  Coming up, they said they're doing the Hillary piece.  Oh, they get a little tease.  Is the reporter right near you?  Yeah, the reporter.  I am standing right behind her, dude.  All right.  Don't let him on to you quite yet.  Look at him.  It's kind of too late.  Why?  She sort of spotted me.  Yeah, but they still have to go on, man.  It says, wow.  Who's asking you about your sign?  Oh, the reporter.  Oh, damn it. 
[02:08:30]  Don't worry about it.  You have balls.  I do.  I refuse to.  Tell her it means wow because you're happy to be here.  She doesn't know what it means.  Flip it over and have it say Hillary is a C.  No way.  No way.  You guys will have to dump me.  All right.  Don't be weird.  Can I say hi to my mother?  I want to say hi to mom.  There you go.  All right.  You want to see if the reporter will wow us?  No, they're going to go to her any second. 
[02:09:00]  Any second, man.  Yeah, any second.  We're going to hold her up high.  Yeah, we've got to keep you on the line here.  We've got to talk to Anthony on line seven.  His friend's in jail for threatening Hillary.  Really?  What's the problem?  All right.  I think they're ready to go to her.  Hold that up high, will you?  All right.  I'm almost ready.  We've got to synchronize.  All right.  Date.  Date with Dave.  Steve and Mark.  Channel 2 News.  Come on, Mark.  This is like interactive TV.  Come on.  This is good.  You get to screw with the TV and watch it at the same time.  We've got a joystick.  We can move Mark around. 
[02:09:30]  This is what the future is like.  Move over, move over, move over.  Move over, yeah.  Jumping around like I'm not.  Fuck you, little baby.  Yeah.  Master, I don't want to see you.  Hey, you're shooting yourself.  How do you do?  You're shooting. 
[02:10:00]  What happened, Mark?  What happened, Mark?  Some CBS guy just jumped in front of you.  You looked like a stock-raving lunatic.  That was classic, man.  Dude, it was hilarious.  They were like, move over, move over.  He's right over.  Dude, are they going to go back to you?  Dude, the guy from the truck came over and ripped my sign out of my face.  Oh, come on.  Did they?  Oh, you're a frigging lunatic, man. 
[02:10:30]  That was hilarious, man.  That was good.  That was good.  Why are they going back?  They got to go back.  They're going back.  What are you going to do when they come back?  You got the bullhorn, right?  I got the bullhorn.  Oh, you got the bullhorn.  Bullhorn.  Say, uh...  Yeah, because the guy's about to punch my teeth out.  And we work for the same company.  Come on, we work for the same company.  They ought to know.  This is a cross-promotion.  Oh, he is so mad.  He came to a walk in a hole.  You were like screaming.  It was hysterical.  Dude, you're a pisser.  It was hilarious. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, we got to explain this for everyone stuck in their car.  It's like interactive TV.  We got Channel 2 News on.  They go live outside Letterman's studio.  There's Mark with the hugest wow sign you'll ever see.  But all you see on TV is like half the O and the second W.  So we're like, move over, move over.  Oh, here he is.  Where are you, Mark?  Where are you, Mark?  They're back to you.  I got some reinforcements, at least.  Get behind her.  Get behind her.  They're back live.  They're back on?  Yeah.  There you go. 
[02:11:30]  There's the wow sign again.  We can see it.  Look out.  Look out.  Chance, whip him out.  Higher.  Chance, whip him out.  Whip him out.  Move to the side.  Move to the side real fast.  Move to the side.  Move over.  Move over. 
[02:12:00]  God damn it, that's the funniest thing.  Hold on a second, Mark.  Hold on.  Hold on a second, Mark.  Butchie's in the studio from the radio check.  I'm listening to you guys, but I'm listening to the TV at the same time.  So she's staring there, and Anthony says, say, whip him out.  So they're yelling, whip him out.  She's trying to do the rest of the report.  So as she's closing the report, she looks back, and she says, as you can hear, it's getting loud out here.  We're calling the police.  We're calling the police.  They can't call the police.  We need you, people.  Hey, Mark. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  That was hilarious.  Well done.  Bravo, Mark.  Now that's interactive television right there.  You're not going to do it.  It's not.  She's not very happy.  Oh, come on.  Who's not happy?  Marsha Clare.  She's very mad at me.  You tell her, go to our boss.  No, I'm not.  I'm just, I'm hanging out.  The thing is, you should be allowed to do your job.  I should be allowed to do mine.  Oh, she's all pissed.  Over there.  Come on.  That's his job.  He is doing his job. 
[02:13:00]  That's his job.  No, it was fine.  I have another live shot to do.  Let me do it until you're done, and I'm going to call the police.  All right.  That sounds good.  Oh, come on.  You can't threaten the cops.  That was fine.  I'm not the cops are here.  We're friends at all.  Hey, Mark.  Yeah, what's up?  Mark, I hear a dare.  I think she's daring you.  All right.  I'll go bother Fox.  I'll go bother Fox.  All right.  Is CBS on their tongue?  Yeah, why don't you bother them?  Oh, is CBS as well?  Yeah, why don't you bother them?  All right.  I'll go bother them.  All right.  Tell her she's got a ton of free advertising right there. 
[02:13:30]  You guys get so much free advertising.  That's unbelievable.  Oh, she is mad.  She is not happy.  Yeah, I bet.  All right.  What a face on her.  All right.  Mark, hold on the line, all right?  Yeah.  Talk to him.  Make sure nothing's going on.  There's so many people that saw it on TV.  Oh, Paula, what's going on?  I just saw that damn stuff just now, and my God, she actually said to Marsha Clark,  oh, wow, we're neighbors.  Oh, I borrowed a cup of sugar.  No, Hillary, why don't you give your hubby a hummer? 
[02:14:00]  You have heard of those, have you?  Oh, boy.  Woo.  Okay.  She's a lunatic.  James, you're next on the program.  What's up?  I'm so pissed at you guys.  I'm driving in my car, and I cannot see this.  You better put it on your website, the official website.  Oh, is it sterile?  Yeah, hopefully someone's got to copy that.  We didn't think it was going to happen today, so.  Oh, my God.  I hope they show it on the news or something.  That's the highlight.  Forget Hillary.  That is the highlight.  All right, James.  Thank you.  See, some guy on the Instant Feedback said the delay really screws with you when you're 
[02:14:30]  watching at home, because it's a 40-second delay from when we're talking to when they're  watching on TV.  Yeah.  So we're saying, move over, move over.  And it was already over.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, it was complete interactive TV.  You know, you've got to link up our audio with that video from the website.  Yeah, really?  You know, I like interactive TV.  We're not waiting.  We'll make it ourselves.  Andrew.  Yeah.  What's up?  Guys, I'm watching on TV, and I'm listening to the radio at the same time.  What the last guy said is totally true.  It's a funniest damn thing, because I hear, I see Mark making a total ass ass, his tongue 
[02:15:00]  hanging out of his mouth, and you guys are like, all right, they're going to cut you real  soon.  Then they cut away and go to the interview, and I hear you guys scream, no, no, no, no,  no, no, no, no.  Funniest damn thing I've ever seen.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Thank you, Andrew.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Good to have a bunch of kids.  That was hilarious.  That could be the funniest thing I've ever seen.  That was pretty funny.  Oh, that was great.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, why?  You guys are hilarious.  You're going to get him shot by the secret service.  Mark's a lunatic. 
[02:15:30]  You're going to pick him off right there on the spot.  He'll do anything, man.  The scene is funny because, like you said, you know, the delay, I'm cracking up.  You're going to get him shot, I swear.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  It was funny because, I mean, the sign wasn't on TV.  And it was interactive.  Like, no, move over, move over.  When he moved over, her head was the O.  It was W all over, her head, and then another W.  Harris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Listen, I was in my room listening to that.  I booked downstairs yelling, put on TV, put on TV. 
[02:16:00]  That was the funniest thing I've ever seen.  You know we're going to get in trouble by the company again.  Yeah, I know.  I feel it in my bones.  Before we get in trouble, I hope they realize we gave him a ton of free advertising.  Come on.  All right, Harris.  Thank you.  Bye.  Why do we always screw with our own company?  I know.  Don't go to the Christmas party this year.  Eddie.  Hey, I'm paying the toll at the Bayonne Bridge at the Turnpike.  I'm dying.  I'm crying over here.  What's going on? 
[02:16:30]  Are you all right?  Oh, my God.  This is hilarious.  I've got to see it on the website.  Please put it on.  All right, man.  Thank you.  I'll be home with a half an hour.  I've got to check it out.  All right, man.  Take care, man.  The big wow pattern would be on Marsha's head.  People are dying.  Pete, what's going on?  O.P.  Anthony, everyone, what's up?  Oh, my God.  I was in my car, right, listening to, like, the buildup to this little bit.  Yeah.  I walked up to my apartment.  I walk in.  My roommates are all watching the television and listening to you guys going, 
[02:17:00]  oh, my God, I think he's going to do it.  I almost pissed in my pants.  That was the funniest thing I've seen in a very, very long time.  Someone just said it, but it's true.  Her head was the O.  Yeah, it was hysterical.  Oh, my, it was priceless.  I just want to tell you guys, man, that was hilarious.  All right.  We've got to go back to Mark.  He's getting in trouble.  Psycho Mark, what's up?  Dude, I almost got a tune-up from the car.  He almost got a tune-up. 
[02:17:30]  I almost got a tune-up.  What happened?  Well, the car comes over, and he's, like, pissed, and he's looking right in my face,  and he's like, dude, he's got a microphone on him.  I'm like, no, sir.  No, sir, it's not, you know?  So he grabs me, pulls me around the corner, and he goes, look, I listen to opening everything  all the time.  Just don't live there, but get out of here, will you?  And I just like, you know, the lady thought I was going to get busted.  The girl from CBS day, she was mad.  She's like, oh, good.  The caps are going to wear a mask in now.  And I'm talking to you around the corner, and he's just like, hey, dude, I love the show, 
[02:18:00]  but you've got to move on, all right?  Give somebody else the sign.  Yeah.  So are you done, you think, or what?  Well, I kind of am, because I'm getting nasty looks.  There's one guy from CBS here.  It looks like he's calling the head honcho.  He's describing me as I look.  You, Mark, can't be doing that.  What the hell are you, Mark?  You're interrupting our own news broadcast, for God's sake.  All right, Mark.  Dude, it's so funny.  I got the Secret Service all in front of the theater here, and they're locked all the doors 
[02:18:30]  through the theater, and nobody's getting in and out.  Mark, the phones are going nuts.  Everyone is peeing in their pants.  It was a steal.  Dude, I'm going to probably head back to the station.  The deed has been done.  All right, no problem.  And I don't think I'm going to get any more exposure here, because they were about the  only people live.  All right, man.  Bye.  We'll see you when you get back.  All right, guys.  Psycho Mark, everyone, he's back.  Yeah.  A little interactive television there for our show.  Oh, God, that's so freaking funny. 
[02:19:00]  The funniest thing is, it's one thing to just hold up a sign in front of a live broadcast.  It's another to hold it up and jump around and yell like a stark, raving madman.  Did you see him in that clip?  It's still another thing to be able to direct the guy doing it.  Yeah, direct the guy doing it.  We're the new Steven Spielberg here.  But it's so funny.  He's jumping up and down.  Yeah!  Yeah!  But, you know, the funniest thing to me is when you said move to the left, and he did  it.  That killed him. 
[02:19:30]  We're watching TV.  Ah!  He's moving hands!  That was funny.  So easily entertained.  But he said, you know, he's going to hold up a wow sign.  I thought it was going to be like a tiny two-by-three-foot sign.  No, that was huge.  Oh, my God.  It was so freaking huge.  It was crazy.  Swip him out Wednesday sign.  Classic.  That was classic.  Uh, Jesse, what's up?  That guy's insane.  You should see the tape.  Yeah, we saw it!  Oh, I'm dying.  Oh, you taped it? 
[02:20:00]  You got a copy of the tape?  Oh, we gotta see that.  Get a copy for the website.  He looks insane.  He's like a madman.  He's like Stutter and John and Crackhead Bob put together.  Oh, don't say that.  He's doing his own thing.  Oh, to be sure.  Thank you, Jesse.  Bye.  Bye.  Huh?  We'll get a copy of the tape.  We'll get a copy of the tape.  Uh, Sean, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  I got a copy of the tape for you guys.  Yeah, cool.  Awesome.  Can you hold on the line?  Sure, yeah.  All right, cool.  We'll have you come down with it and everything.  You can check out the show.  All right, thanks. 
[02:20:30]  All right, hold on.  Ben, we'll talk to you.  Uh, Steve, you're next.  Sorry, man.  Hey, Steve, you're up.  Yeah, how you doing?  All right.  I just, uh, want to thank you guys for curing me of the flu.  I just had to die a Coke through my nose.  I was laughing so hard.  Awesome.  I can breathe in five days.  Of course.  The show has the power to heal.  Yes.  Thank you very much.  All right, Steve.  The phones are just nuts.  Bob.  That was so funny.  I was sitting there taking a bong hit. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  And I didn't know what channel you guys were talking about.  So I'm all trying to call in and find out what channel.  And I'm thinking, no way, man.  They're not going to do it to CBS.  They work for CBS.  They know.  And sure enough, man, there they were on CBS.  I hope you guys enjoyed it because we are going to get screwed again.  Yeah, we're going to go on, man.  Guaranteed we're in trouble for that.  We're going to be pulled into another meeting.  Don't you boys ever learn.  What the hell is wrong with you?  All right, Sean.  God damn got Fox, NBC, ABC all standing around waiting to go live. 
[02:21:30]  You picked CBS?  When did Ross Perot buy the station?  Tell me about it.  You should be in on some of these conference calls from down south with this guy.  We are so screwed.  You boys got a gliss in the reason.  They want you to work for this company for a long time.  We want you to have a long career with us here at this company.  But God damn, we're not going to tolerate that.  Cowbell Bill's on the warm line.  Our buddy, our pal.  Hey, Wheel.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  What's up, man? 
[02:22:00]  I got to tell you, man.  You know, I'm listening to the radio.  I'm like, what are they talking about?  I'm doing the dishes.  I got my back toward the TV.  Because of the delay, I turned around.  It was perfect timing, man.  I see Mark jumping around like a loon.  He was like, oh, my God.  He's looking like, I want an Easter egg.  I want an Easter egg.  I want an Easter egg.  He was like a madman.  He was.  He was psycho Mark.  He's just like jumping around yelling.  And the news woman is just horrified. 
[02:22:30]  But she has to stay like, isn't the camera so horrified?  She's got to keep going.  Really hard.  I couldn't believe it, man.  Whip him out.  Whip him out.  They got to show that at 11 o'clock.  Yeah.  Right?  They got to show that at 11.30, right?  They'll never show that again.  They will never.  You will never see that again.  Oh, my God.  She's horrified.  They're going to show that in a meeting when they ream you out.  I'm pissing in my pants. 
[02:23:00]  There's so many people in their cars.  It was the funniest thing ever.  Oh, my God.  Ever.  There's got to be a few cars on the side of the road, boys.  All right.  All right.  Hey, Adam, what's up, brother?  How are you?  All right, man.  You're going to see Adam at Governor's this weekend?  Are you going to go?  Yeah, I'm going like tomorrow.  All right, man.  Give me a buzz or something, you know?  Maybe we'll hook up and check it out.  Cool.  There he is.  There he is.  Psycho Mark.  Bill, we got to fly.  Hi, boys.  Take it in, Bill.  Bow, Bill, everyone.  Psycho Mark back in the studio. 
[02:23:30]  Bravo.  We bow to you today, man.  You're a frigging lunatic.  You look like a mental patient.  With the fur on the arms.  He's wearing a sweater.  He's got fur on the arms.  Taylor?  Taylor?  Taylor?  The mobile producer was so mad at me.  He wanted to knock my teeth.  He wanted to tune me up.  Tune you up.  We're going to catch the heaps.  Yeah, we're going to catch hell for that.  Guaranteed.  We're going to catch a lot of heaps for that one. 
[02:24:00]  Uh-oh.  Let's go to Tom real fast.  Tom, what's up?  Yo.  Yeah.  You guys almost broke my frigging ankle.  I ran down the stairs to see what the hell was going on.  And you ever, like, see somebody walking on water or something?  I fell down the frigging stairs and almost cracked my head open.  Because I had to see what the hell was going on.  That was the funniest frigging thing I've ever seen in my life.  That was so funny.  It was just beyond funny.  That was a moment, man.  I tell you, anytime something happens in this city where they go live somewhere, we've got to just send you instantly over there. 
[02:24:30]  You guys are the funniest frigging people, man.  You guys rock.  All right.  Thanks, Tom.  Later.  Bye.  Who yelled at you?  Was it the newscast that he yelled at?  No, the guy actually came from inside the truck.  Who was the chick, though, that we heard yelling at you?  That was her.  Oh, that was her?  That was Marsha?  Yeah, it was Marsha.  Ryan.  Yeah.  I just want to know, guys.  When is the farewell show going to be?  That's why you've got to listen every day. 
[02:25:00]  This could be it right here today.  You never know.  You never know.  And I'm surprised Marco Mark made it back without getting shook.  God, by the Secret Service.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Hi, man.  Wow.  They're just coming in like crazy.  Mark.  Yeah.  What's up?  How you doing?  All right.  Hey, listen.  I'm racing home.  I'm about a half a mile from work.  I hear you guys on the radio.  I think I picked off two old ladies in front of a shop right in Rochelle Park.  I'm driving.  I go flying down my block 70 miles an hour. 
[02:25:30]  I just park my car in the middle of the street and race the stairs.  I'm still watching Channel 2.  I'm still watching Channel 2.  See?  We gave a lot of publicity.  Channel 2 news rocks.  How can they get mad at you guys?  We might need you for a character witness.  I'm telling you right now.  I'm watching a little show about little kids right now.  I can't turn the radio on, you know?  I have that delay thing.  But I'm going to buy that.  I'm advertising.  I got Lee Cowan in Washington, D.C. right now.  So you guys don't worry about it.  You guys are funny guys.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  Very funny.  See you later.  All right, bye.  But the problem is we're always screwing with our company.  We don't mean to, but it just happens that way. 
[02:26:00]  I know.  Yeah, but it's good publicity for them.  Oh, yeah.  You tell the big boss when he reams us out again.  Jimmy.  Yeah, the funniest thing happened.  Yeah.  My dad's driving me home from drug rehab, right?  Dude, he almost rear-ended a cop car.  We're laughing so hard.  The cops pull him over, and my dad's explaining the situation.  The cop just burst out laughing.  He let my dad go because he was listening to you guys, too.  Oh, awesome.  The cop was almost in tears when he pulled us over.  Awesome.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  Cool.  I'm going to let you guys know.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Okay.  Oh, God damn it.  There's one guy who's doing a bong hit.  The other guy's coming home from rehab.  We're proud of our listeners.  Yes.  They don't aim high.  Rob.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  All right.  Mark, I got one question for you.  Yeah.  How do you walk around with that set you got?  What do you, like, walk around like John Wayne, swaying like?  I mean, you should be up for, like, a daytime Emmy with that performance.  He comes into the studio with a wheelbarrow for his junk.  Oh, God. 
[02:27:00]  I got a small, like, one-room apartment.  Yeah.  My living room and my kitchen are connected.  Yeah.  I'm listening to the radio in the living room.  I had to see Channel 2.  I'm fucking into my bedroom because my TV's busted in the living room.  I hit the linoleum floor.  Spill.  I crack my head on the floor.  You guys almost killed me.  You know how funny that was?  When they went back to Stephen Clark, he had a real tough time not smiling.  You could see, like, his mouth was like.  Yeah.  Well, I got an instant feedback here.  I don't know about this.  It seems real.  This guy from the CBS control room. 
[02:27:30]  He goes, God, I'm in the CBS control room.  We almost went off the air.  All the technicians were on the floor.  What do you got, Ben?  We know that Stephen Clark listens to this show because Mark and I met him once, and he listens to you guys.  He told us that.  Is that Mike Adams' part?  Yeah, is that Mike Adams' part?  Was he?  Yeah.  He went totally laughing.  He loves you guys.  That's a guy who's definitely cracking a smile when they came back.  Oh, that's funny. 
[02:28:00]  All right, listen.  We definitely got to take a break.  Yeah.  We went, like, 20 minutes longer than we were supposed to.  And consulted an attorney.  Yeah, we got to.  Oh, please.  Don't look.  Oh, we're screwed again.  Yeah, but it's always fun.  What the hell?  All right.  We got to take a break.  It might be a little longer than usual, but please stay right there, okay?  We'll be back with more of your phone calls, all right?  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Someone get this pen out of my nose.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW, it's Opie and Anthony. 
[02:28:30]  We're in the middle of a pretty long commercial break because we just talked for, like, 50 straight minutes.  So, please hang in there.  Bunch of other people on the lines that have comments about Mark's little WOW TV stunt outside the Letterman studio.  They're all just losing it outside the studio.  But we apologize.  Guys, we're in the middle of a long commercial break.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  1027 WNEW.  We're back.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I'm for our...  God, that was funny. 
[02:29:00]  ...and our new hero, Psycho Mark, in the studio.  Psycho Mark, a stark-raving madman with balls the size of globes.  Unbelievable.  They hum when he walks.  Unbelievable.  Got an email here from Nick from Jersey.  Yeah.  Okay, that stunt proves it.  You guys are the funniest, most effed up people I've ever seen.  Um, the delay made it more bizarre, because he was watching as we were talking.  We have the delay to deal with, but, uh...  Some people said it was funny that way.  Cool.  I think it's worth the punishment that you guys should be getting. 
[02:29:30]  I just hope you live through it.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Well, you know, you gotta go for it where you can, and sometimes there's things called  friendly fire, you know?  Like, we're just throwing this crap out there, and unfortunately, one of our, uh, compadres  got it.  Oops.  Uh, Al.  Oh, absolutely incredible.  You're brilliant, as you guys are talking about, and I'm watching the TV, waiting for  the build-up.  I find myself jumping all over my living room, like, at the end of a Toyota commercial, 
[02:30:00]  and I see Hawk in the background, and, uh, now I pretty much gotta go change my drawers,  because I, uh, pretty much peed myself from laughing so hard.  That's absolutely incredible.  She was so bent.  Absolutely.  I tell her that she can't do a job.  Obviously, she has no sense of humor.  Oh.  I could see her news editor just screaming at her, but, uh, I got a psycho walk.  I'm glad that guy hustled you out of there, bro.  I don't know if I was working at detail, I would have smuggled you out, too. 
[02:30:30]  All right, Al.  Thank you.  Have a great day, guys.  Thank you.  That guy feels like Harriet Tubman getting off the safety of the Underground Railroad.  Jeff.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Uh, nothing.  I got out of the limo, and I got into an accident.  I don't have to suck freaking much.  Oh, we're on cloud nine right now.  It was just the freaking funniest thing ever.  Ever.  I know.  He's a freaking nut, man.  Yeah.  This one puts, uh, this one puts Psycho Mark on the map, finally. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, I know.  All right, man.  All right.  Take it easy, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Here's another guy.  I'm one of the techies at CBS News Studio.  I saw what happened.  Fell on the floor laughing.  I almost got fired.  Hey, Greg, what's up?  Hey, listen.  I used to intern for CBS in the OJ unit, and I also worked for Hillary once.  Yeah.  You guys should get Ziggy and Snoop and go back there when she leaves the studio.  That would be so funny to see that.  And then have her tell them what she's going to do for them if she makes it to be senator 
[02:31:30]  in New York.  Very good.  All right?  Thank you.  Hey, you guys suck.  All right?  All right, man.  Uh, Bob.  That's Al.  Al, what's up?  Yeah, you know, this is going to make Dick Clarks, flunders, and bloopers.  You guys are all right.  See, now, I guess we got to, what happened?  Because when we saw the sign, we were freaking out so much.  What was being said on the TV?  Was she, like, really distracted because you were yelling so loud, Mark?  I was behind her. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, hold on, hold on.  I was behind her.  I didn't really get to see her.  But you were shouting like a lunatic.  I was screaming on top of my lungs.  I was yelling, forget the bullhorn.  I don't need a bullhorn.  See, that's what we need to find out now.  Yeah, how did it look on TV?  Butchie said he was listening in the other room, and he heard me screaming, you know,  Weep, weep, weep, weep, weep.  And she was all flustered, you know?  She was just, her makeup was peeling off.  I keep looking back at the TV like it's still on.  I know.  I don't want to see it.  Well, they're going live again, but we were told to leave. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't totally push it.  Go back with a sign that says John 11.  Get the big afro, the multicolored afro.  I'll go back with a disguise.  Dave, go with someone else.  Dave, what's up?  Guys, what are you doing to me?  I almost killed myself.  I have a cast on, and I heard it, and I'm trying to do some work.  So I run down the stairs, you know, I'm trying to hop down as fast as I can.  And I trip.  I almost crack my skull open.  I almost break my cast off.  Yeah, everyone was rushing to the TV to see this. 
[02:33:00]  I know.  I was just like, Jesus Christ, you guys are trying to kill me.  And Psycho Mark, man, you're the effing man, dude.  I love you guys.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  All right.  Rob?  Hey, Rob.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  You're next on NAW.  What's up?  Yeah, how you doing, ONA?  All right.  All right.  I've been listening for like about eight months now.  You guys rule.  You're the best.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, I was just watching the news again before they went to commercial and Marsha Kramer  was on again.  She was so pissed off.  It was like the funniest thing.  Don't even crack a smile. 
[02:33:30]  Like they cleared the whole area back there.  I didn't see Psycho Mark or anybody.  Really?  They cleared it out.  Yeah, we're the best.  I think we're screwed again.  No, don't say that.  I hope not.  I hope not either.  All right.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you, Rob.  Hey, bye-bye.  Bye.  Tommy, you're next.  A couple more of these and we'll move on.  Yeah.  Yeah, I never thought anything could be Naked Charlie, man.  Now, it's the soul of Mark.  We should quit today because I don't think we'll ever do anything funnier than what just 
[02:34:00]  happened.  Well, at least I got it on tape.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks, Tommy.  Bye.  Bye.  This guy was next to you when you were holding up the sign.  Rob.  Hey, what's going on?  You were really there?  Yeah, it was right there.  Okay.  It was the funniest thing I've ever heard of in my entire life.  It was so cool.  The best was a bunch of you guys on your cell phones trying to call the show because you were  behind the reporter as well.  Yeah, it was good.  Is he there, Psycho Mark?  Yeah.  He's a crazy bastard.  All right.  Thanks, Rob.  Hold on.  I'm just as good as Psycho Mark.  Do you need me to do anything? 
[02:34:30]  Well, wait.  Were you there when she was yelling at him?  Yeah.  How fast was she?  I was on the floor.  Is there nothing you need me to do?  I'm just like Psycho Mark.  We have a Psycho Mark.  We have a Psycho Mark.  I'm from Armonk, New York.  If you guys...  Thanks, brother.  I live right near Hillary.  Rob, I've got to hang up on you.  You've got the radio show on in the background.  I'm from Armonk, New York.  It's very, very distracting.  People say we ought to do this on a daily basis with Total Request Live over at MTV.  It's not a bad idea.  We're looking for things that Psycho Mark can do in the future.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  He swears he'll do just about anything.  Yeah.  Even things that'll get him arrested.  He doesn't care.  We've got bail money.  Yeah, as long as you offer a murder or something.  Yeah, right.  Nothing for a felony.  Right.  But send in your ideas, and we'll get Mark to start doing some really wacky things.  He had the big wow hat on, the wow sign.  Just a little stock-raving lunatic.  I love it.  I regressed back to being like, I think, 13.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It was so cool.  But it all comes together. 
[02:35:30]  Let's get him to eat a worm.  This guy, John, has got something funny.  John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Can I borrow a higher Psycho Mark?  My ex-wife's getting married in two weeks.  He can hold up a big sign that says, you're slut.  No, just call him.  You're slut.  No, you can do anything you want.  You can call him anything.  You can call him C-word, everything.  She fits him all.  Oh, funny.  I want to see you guys did the best thing ever.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Hey, thank you.  Thank you.  Bye. 
[02:36:00]  Bye.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Hey, dudes.  What's up, man?  What's up?  Dude, I swear I broke my nose, man.  I broke my frickin' nose trying to get to see this thing.  I'm listening to you guys, and my TV's got crappy reception, so I start running down the  hall to see it on the other TV.  I ran smack right down into the middle of the damn doorjamb.  My nose is broken, dude.  I'm going to the hospital now.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  All right, bro.  Take care.  How many people are we going to send to the hospital today from this bitch?  Another guy was there and says that Marsh is really pissed. 
[02:36:30]  Chris.  Yo, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Yo, Psycho Mark, man.  You know what it felt like, man, when Reagan got shot?  Remember when all those cops just jumped on that one guy?  Dude, that was a trip, man.  Yo, guys, man.  You know what?  I never knew these freaking news people put on so much freaking makeup.  Look at somebody who went on there with a spackle.  Holy crap, man.  I couldn't believe that, man.  She was nasty looking, bro.  I shaved the dog's butt.  It made it look better looking than that. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Very good, man.  Later, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Instant Feedback says, uh, Marsha just came back on and she looked mad as hell.  Yeah.  She's still pissed.  Wrist.  I guarantee they're talking to somebody from CBS down the hall as we speak.  Guarantee it.  Just know this company, like the back of my head at this point.  Oh, we're sorry.  Yeah, that'll help.  Uh, Pete.  Hello?  You're up, Pete.  What's up?  No, this is Danny.  You got the wrong name. 
[02:37:30]  All right, Danny.  I called in about The Rock.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think you should send Psycho Mark over to WWF in the Continental Arena to talk about  The Rock being a nigger.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Come on, Pete.  We're all having fun and you gotta, you gotta say that.  Jeez.  Jiminy Cricket.  The Garden.  Royal Rumble.  Yeah.  I think we have tickets.  Get you a huge sign.  Front row.  Front row.  Well, we're looking for signs, man.  Like, we've seen some before.  Like, every time WWF comes around, Continental or The Garden, Coliseum, we see the signs. 
[02:38:00]  Opie and Anthony or ONA or Rusty Trombone.  We are looking, anybody that is going to any of those shows that are televised in this area,  especially the Royal Rumble, just bashing the rock signs.  Just bash the hell out of The Rock with your signs.  Yeah.  We will have you on the next day.  Especially The Garden Show, January 23rd. 
[02:38:30]  Yep.  Because that's the big pay-per-view.  That'd just be hysterical.  The Rock's a pussy.  ONA, love The Rock.  Yeah, you'll see that.  All right.  Rich, you're next on the show.  All right.  Hey, what's up?  Not much, man.  I was just sitting there going home on the LIE in bumper-to-bumper traffic,  and when that went down with Psycho Mark, about five cars around me started beeping their horns. 
[02:39:00]  And the guy next to me was pounding on his dashboard.  I almost wet my pants.  I couldn't believe it, man.  I just, I couldn't wait to get home, but I didn't make it in time.  Oh, too bad.  It was too funny, man.  You guys rock.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, man.  I think the audio is just as funny, though.  We might have to replay that at the end of the show.  I want to hear that.  Because it was just unbelievable.  And, of course, a good rock sign will be,  Hey, Rock, steal or eat?  You know what we mean.  Oh, man. 
[02:39:30]  I think we're just about done with this.  I think we have to take another break, Ant.  You want to give those away?  Yeah.  All right.  That'll change the subject.  Oh, classic.  Mark, we bow to you today.  Yes.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Love when we have one of those moments on this show.  Thank you.  I love that.  Penny.  Gosh.  Gosh.  All right.  We got some tickets to give away.  It's a Seton Hall basketball.  Seton Hall playing St. John's. 
[02:40:00]  Very cool game at the Continental Arena on this Tuesday, January 18th.  On this Tuesday.  Whatever.  January 18th.  If you want to go see Seton Hall and St. John's at the Continental Arena,  you could call up right now.  Spaz is working the phone.  So I'll take the 10th caller.  212-757-1027.  Tickets for all Seton Hall games are available through Ticketmaster.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of fools. 
[02:40:30]  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  Ah, yeah.  Line of the day.  Move to the left.  Oh, God.  I guess we're losing to Adam, huh?  Yeah, I got to go.  Adam's cutting out?  I got to go.  Where are you going, pal?  Where are you going?  I got to go do laundry.  I got stuff to do.  If you don't get there by 6.30, you don't get a dryer.  A big star like you. 
[02:41:00]  You got to be going laundry.  You're coming out Thursday.  I want everything to be just so.  Yes.  Governors, tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  And Sunday.  The incomparable Adam Ferrara.  Comedy stylings.  Yeah.  I think Adam wants to leave after that stunt we just pulled with CBS News.  He still wants that chance at Letterman.  Yeah, he wants to get that.  Oh, I got it.  That's right.  You guys can yell all you want.  We wrecked it.  That was so funny.  Yeah, that was good.  All right.  All right, Adam.  We will be sure to catch up with you at Governors. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  Good seeing you again.  Hey, you got me on the list, man.  I'm going to put you down.  You're a hell of a guy.  You want to sit ringside or you want to sit in the back and look at the brutes?  Sit in the back.  You know, because it's like, I don't like being right up front.  I hate being in the front.  You get some smart-ass comic, and then I got to unleash on him, and it looks bad because  he's getting paid to be there, and I'm not.  I'm tearing him a new A-hole.  Oh, my God.  And it's going to be foot.  And Adam does work the front row pretty good.  No, I don't.  Not Adam.  I'm talking about the other comics that are on there.  Like, I know Adam wouldn't razz me or something. 
[02:42:00]  The first thing I do, I swear to you, when I sit down and I am seated pretty close to  the stage when a comic comes out, I look at him.  The second he comes out and think of at least three frigging barbs I could slam at this guy  at any given moment.  So if he says anything to me, boom, I'm right back.  In two seconds, the crowd goes bullcrap.  You're a Boy Scout.  You're prepared.  I know.  Good for you.  You got to be when you go to those places.  It makes you look really funny, no matter how stupid you are. 
[02:42:30]  It's not like a daytime strip bar.  People can get hurt in these times.  Right.  All right, Adam.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, Pat.  Always good seeing you.  Make it easy there, buddy.  Be good, champ.  Anthony, on the way, we're going to play the Hillary and Chelsea go to Africa.  A lot of people requesting it.  Yeah, I know.  It's going to be on Letterman tonight.  It's juvenile humor at its best.  That's on the way.  And Opie involved with that bit.  Yeah.  You voiced something.  I actually did some voices for the radio show.  The voice of Chelsea Clinton.  Played by Opie.  Played by Opie.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  In a stunning dual role, I was Mandingo and Hillary. 
[02:43:00]  Patty Duke.  It's so juvenile.  It really is.  It's third great humor at its best.  If you've never heard it, stick around for that.  Also, we're going to attempt to replay the audio of Psycho Mark outside Letterman's studio.  It's got to get at least a piece of that, because I've got to hear that again.  I was just laughing.  Yeah, because we had no idea what we said.  We were laughing so hard.  Yeah.  In the meantime, though, Ann, a quick musical break, because we've really got to regroup  here, okay?  All right.  And we'll be back with that Hillary and Chelsea thing from Africa. 
[02:43:30]  Opie.  What is it going to take for us to pitch you off to the point where you're going to change  the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  Opie and Anthony.  He just received a Ph.D. in stupidity.  102.7 WNEW.  And, yes, we are here, getting a little nervous.  A couple insiders have called us to tell us that there's a lot of crap going down right  now because of us and our show. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  A lot of yelling and screaming.  A bunch of people want to know who we report to.  That's never a good sign, Anthony.  Oops.  Well, if you're just tuning in, you just missed some unbelievable stuff today.  Yeah, it was fun.  My God.  We're still in the middle of our radio show, but now we're getting a little nervous, Anthony.  Just a bit.  Not as much as April 1st a couple of years ago.  That's true.  We can't get fired over something like that, can we?  I'm not saying anything. 
[02:44:30]  Okay.  Knock a little wood.  Alan, you're next on the radio show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  All right.  I was just watching the footage on Channel 2.  They were showing the coming-up stories at 6 o'clock.  Yeah.  They showed Hillary coming in, and you can hear Psycho Mark really clearly in the background  yelling, show us your fun bags.  You just got to watch out for that.  I'm on the road right now, but hopefully they'll show it again tonight, and maybe you'll catch 
[02:45:00]  it on the other channels, too.  All right.  Cool.  Thank you.  Can I just say a shout-out to my cousin Ashman?  You just did, man.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Show us your fun bags.  If you hear that on the news tonight in the background, that was Psycho Mark.  God darn.  They're getting the audio from earlier on the show, Ant, so we can replay it before we get  out of here at 7.  Oh, good.  We got to replay, because I got to hear what we were screaming, because we were laughing  so freaking hard.  I know.  I got to hear a piece of that. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, man.  We're going to play the Hillary and Chelsea thing in a second here, too.  Yeah.  Juvenile humor at its best.  Oh, we've gotten plenty of requests for it.  What was the instant feedback saying?  Uh, people seem to have, uh, really liked it.  I just hope, uh, I just hope management liked it, Anthony.  I'm sure.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we'll see.  We'll see what happens.  We're one big happy family.  Come on.  Uh, John, what's up?  Yeah, when is the Van Halen coming on the radio? 
[02:46:00]  Automatic shuttle.  Yes, the automatic, the button upstairs.  You guys are pushing the limits today.  You're great.  Yeah.  Just when we thought it wouldn't get better today, we just took it over the top.  All right, John.  Thanks a lot, guys.  See you back.  Thank you.  Bye.  A lot of people are a little paranoid now.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Bobby Anthony?  Big fan.  Bronco Bash.  Remember?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you remember that?  Of course, yeah.  Yeah.  Down there in Menachie.  I'm going to say goodbye to you guys because I think this is it. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, don't say that.  Come on.  I don't want to say it, but, man, the first lady and all that?  Well, we didn't mess up, guys.  We didn't mess with her, really.  Psycho Mark had a bullhorn, and when she arrived at the Letterman Studios, you could  hear clear as day.  Psycho Mark yelling, show us your fun bags.  Yeah, but they're always looking for a way to screw you guys.  I think we're going to.  That's true.  We just, I don't even know what to say.  We cannot stay out of trouble.  Well, at least I got my Bronco Bash shirt signed by two guys I used to know from New York.  Oh, my God. 
[02:47:00]  I don't see that.  Hey, guys, good luck, man.  All right, bye.  Good radio.  All right.  Bye-bye.  I just hope the upper people thought it was good radio, Anthony.  Maybe they're very busy.  We really did look for the other news stations.  They just weren't around.  No, that was the first live shot.  We were in place, and we went.  We really were trying to look for the Fox News and the other ones, but they just weren't  there.  So, once again, we picked on our own team.  Oh, boy. 
[02:47:30]  I'm getting nervous.  I really am.  All right, let's play the Hillary and Chelsea bit.  Yeah.  It's a favorite.  It's juvenile humor, though, at its best.  Hey, why not?  It fits in perfect with today's show.  Yeah, Hillary and Chelsea took a trip to Africa.  Yeah.  Can't confirm this, but I believe we have some audio from their trip, right, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  Of course we can.  All right, let's go to the tape.  Mom, are these people cannibals?  Now, now, Chelsea. 
[02:48:00]  Why would you say that?  Because the chief said he'd get anything to eat me.  He sounds a lot like your father.  Your mother, Hillary, is very respected here.  She has the one quality that is most coveted in our village.  What's that?  Wisdom?  Compassion?  No, a fat white ass.  Oh, well.  Your African name, Chelsea, is Kiala Abolafu.  That's beautiful.  What does it mean?  Lanky pale girl with face of a wombat. 
[02:48:30]  Oh.  Hey, Mom, Mandingo wants me to go into the forest with him.  I think he's going to let me have one of his pets.  Why do you think that, Chelsea?  Because he said he's going to give me his 12-inch Ubangy Black Snake.  Oh, it's beautiful out here, Mandingo.  By the way, what does your name mean?  It means man with three legs.  But you only have two legs.  Oh, really? 
[02:49:00]  Wow!  Chelsea, when we are through tonight, the whole village will call you Iwachalakanaya.  Me?  What does it mean?  That means she who cannot sit for weeks.  Ooh!  Now grab your ankles, Chelsea, and I will demonstrate what your father does to your countrymen.  Oh, my God!  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  Oh, my God!  Put it away!  Put it away!  All right.  So there's some audio in there.  Jesus, man.  That's just wrong.  It's like we're still in the jungle. 
[02:49:30]  I know.  Well, there's a part two.  Of course there is.  There were so many unanswered questions in part one.  Right.  It's like the Godfather and the Godfather 2.  More audio from Hillary and Chelsea visiting Africa.  Oh, Mandingo!  It's so big!  I need two hands to hold it!  Oh, that's it, Chelsea.  Now wrap your lips around it.  Like this?  Yes, that's it.  Now blow, Chelsea.  Blow!  Blow!  Nothing's coming out! 
[02:50:00]  Oh, be patient, Chelsea.  And blow harder!  Blow!  Bullseye!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Wow, thanks for showing me how to use your blow gun, Mandingo!  Anytime, Chelsea.  We best go back to the village and find your mother.  I wonder where she is.  Maybe she's in this hut.  Oh!  Mom!  What are you doing with Mandingo's sister?  Oh, dear.  You said you were going on a safari. 
[02:50:30]  No, no.  I said before the day ends, I want to be deep in the bush.  Well, you do what you want.  I'm going to help Mandingo take care of a bad animal.  What are you talking about, Chelsea?  He wants me to spank his monkey.  Well, just be back in time for dinner.  Okay.  Well, what are we having?  I don't know about you, but I'll be having the African beaver.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:51:00]  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, for now, anyway.  We're trying to get the audio.  We've got to play the audio one last time before we get out of here.  Yeah.  Because I know we'll be told never to play it again.  I'm sure.  Let's go to the phones real fast.  We're about to play What Did We Learned on the Opie and Anthony show as well today.  Celeste, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I was watching Channel 4, and J.D. Dapper came on and was talking about Hillary Clinton and her move to New York. 
[02:51:30]  And they cut to her coming out of her car at the David Letterman show.  And all you hear in the background is Mark saying, show me your...  And they cut back to the newsroom.  Oh, they cut off fun bags?  Right.  I guess I can't say fun bags.  I'm psycho.  Mark asked the first lady to show him her fun bags.  Jesus, man.  I was just cracking up.  Because I'm trying to watch it on Channel 2 and see if it comes on any other station. 
[02:52:00]  All right, Celeste.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Bye.  I think we're all set with the audio.  Cool.  Uh, Mike.  Yo.  What's up?  Let me tell you, ONA.  Yeah.  You guys need a new job.  Yeah.  You better start.  Look, I got something for you.  Well.  I'm going to make sure you guys are the best employed truck drivers in the county.  Thanks, man.  All right?  You guys are out of your mind.  The thing in Africa?  Forget about it.  What are you?  Don't you think they got the Secret Service?  They're coming after you. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  We're going to have to leave, like, the back way today.  I think so.  I'm telling you.  You guys are nuts.  Thank you, Mike.  I hit the airport's mouth compared to that.  How dare you say that about the first lady?  All right, Mike.  Oh, thank you.  You're going to be a truck driver.  Hang out with me, buddy.  All right, man.  All right?  Thank you.  You guys.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to hang up on you.  I wasn't going to stop him.  Taylor.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Dude, you guys just put the nail on the coffin.  You guys didn't get in trouble for the wow sign.  And that last Chelsea bit was out of control. 
[02:53:00]  Come on.  I thought we were all having fun.  Yeah.  What happened?  Hey, that really was their trip, right?  Yeah.  We're not really sure, but we think so, yeah.  We think so?  Yeah.  Okay.  You guys rock.  All right, Taylor.  Later, bro.  People love that bit.  I think it's so juvenile.  That's funny.  Come on.  Chris, what's up?  What are you now?  Mr. CBS FM?  Yeah.  What's up, Chris?  I actually listened to the other station, 1010 Winds, because in my office I got an FM radio,  but I only got an AM in my car.  Yeah.  Don't ask. 
[02:53:30]  But I missed that whole thing, and I just beat my up.  We'll show you a wow sign.  Yeah.  I missed that whole thing, and that's what I get for leaving my office early.  I could have dealt with my boss and listened to the whole thing, but now I missed it.  All right.  All right, man, but keep rocking, dude.  All right.  Well, let's play it now.  What the hell?  One last time before we throw it into the ONA archives, Anthony.  Good boy.  This is a tape.  It's not going on as we speak, but earlier, you know, Hillary Clinton showing up at David  Letterman's studio. 
[02:54:00]  We had Psycho Mark out there just causing all sorts of havoc.  Yeah, a little bit of trouble.  And then we told him to find, like, you know, a news station, because he brought with him  a huge, I mean, huge wow sign.  That obviously means whip him out Wednesday.  Yeah.  And Psycho Mark found the Channel 2 news crew.  Channel 2 news crew.  We work for the same company, idiot.  Don't say that too much. 
[02:54:30]  So let's pick up the tape from about an hour ago.  Psycho Mark outside the David Letterman studio as we're trying to get our big wow sign on  any TV station.  It just happened to be the same one we work for.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, yeah.  Mark.  Yeah.  Coming up, they said they're doing the Hillary piece.  Oh, they get a little tease.  Is the reporter right near you?  Yeah, the reporter.  I am standing right behind her, dude.  All right.  Don't let him on to you quite yet.  Look at him.  It's kind of too late. 
[02:55:00]  Why?  She sort of spotted me.  Yeah, but they still have to go on, man.  It says wow.  Who's asking you about your sign?  Oh, the reporter.  Oh, damn it.  Don't worry about it.  You have balls.  I do.  I refuse to tell her it means wow because you're happy to be here.  She doesn't know what it means.  All right, flip it over and have it say Hillary is a C.  Hillary said no way.  You guys will have to dump me.  All right.  You're doing weird. 
[02:55:30]  Can I say hi to my mother?  I want to say hi to mom.  There you go.  All right.  You want to see if the reporter will wow us?  No, they're going to go to her any second now.  Any second, man.  Yeah, any second.  We're going to hold it up high.  Yeah, we've got to keep you on the line here.  We've got to talk to Anthony on line seven, his friends in jail, for threatening Hillary.  Really?  What's the problem?  All right.  I think they're ready to go to her.  Hold that up high, will you?  All right.  Almost ready. 
[02:56:00]  We've got to synchronize.  All right.  Date with Dave.  Stephen Clark.  Channel 2 News.  Come on, Mark.  This is like interactive TV.  Come on.  This is good.  You get to screw with the TV and watch it at the same time.  All right.  Joystick.  We can move and walk around.  This is what the future is like.  There he is.  It's a huge gas sign.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Move over.  Look at him jumping around like I'm not.  Fuck you, lunatic. 
[02:56:30]  Come on, you're a lunatic.  Come on, you're a lunatic.  What happened, Mark?  What happened, Mark?  Some CBS guy just jumped in front of you.  You looked like a stock-raving lunatic.  That was classic, man.  Dude, it was hilarious.  They were like, move over, move over. 
[02:57:00]  It was right over.  Dude, are they going to go back to you?  Dude, the guy from the truck came over and ripped my sign out of my head.  Oh, come on.  Dude, dang.  Yeah, no.  Oh, you're a friggin' lunatic, man.  That was hilarious, man.  That was good.  We're going to go back.  They're going back.  We're going back.  What are you going to do when they come back?  You got the bullhorn, right?  Oh, you got the bullhorn.  Bullhorn.  Yeah, because the guy's about to punch my teeth out.  And we work for the same company.  Come on, we work for the same company.  They ought to know. 
[02:57:30]  This is a cross-promotion.  Oh, he is so mad.  He came to the rock and the whole thing.  You were like screaming.  It was hysterical.  Dude, you're a pizzer.  It was hilarious.  I mean, we've got to explain this for everyone stuck in their car.  It's like interactive TV.  We've got Channel 2 news on.  They go live outside Letterman's studio.  There's Mark with the hugest wow sign you'll ever see.  But all you see on TV is like half the O and the second W.  So we're like, move over, move over. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, here he is.  Where are you, Mark?  Where are you, Mark?  They're back to you.  I got some reinforcements at least.  Get behind her.  Get behind her.  Get back alive.  Get back on her?  Yeah.  There you go.  There's the wow sign again.  Look at him.  Look out.  Look out.  Look out.  Chance, whip him out.  Higher.  Chance, whip him out.  Whip him out.  Move to the side. 
[02:58:30]  Move to the side real fast.  Move to the side.  Move over.  Move over.  There we go.  God damn it.  That's the funniest thing.  Hold on a second, Mark.  Hold on.  Hold on a second, Mark.  Butchie's in the studio for the radio.  I'm listening to you guys, but I'm listening to the TV at the same time.  So she's standing there, and Anthony says, say, whip him out.  So they're yelling, whip him out.  So he's trying to do the rest of the report. 
[02:59:00]  So as she's closing the report, she looks back and she says, as you can hear, it's getting  loud out here.  We're calling the police.  They can't call the police.  Hey, Mark.  Yeah.  That was hilarious.  Well done.  Bravo, Mark.  Now that's interactive television right there.  It's not, but she's not very happy.  Oh, come on.  Who's not happy?  Marsha Kramer.  She's very mad at me.  You tell her, go to our boss. 
[02:59:30]  No, I'm not.  I'm just, I'm hanging out.  The thing is, you should be allowed to do your job.  I should be allowed to do mine.  Oh, she's all pissed.  Come on.  That's his job.  He is doing his job.  That's his job.  No, it was fine.  I have another live shot to do.  Let me do it in the future.  I'm going to call the police.  All right.  That sounds good.  Oh, come on.  You can't threaten the cops.  That was fine.  I've got the cops here.  We're friends with them.  Hey, Mark.  Hey, what's up?  Mark, I hear a dare.  I think she's daring you. 
[03:00:00]  All right.  I'll go bother Fox.  I'll go bother Fox.  All right.  Is there CBS on your toe?  Yeah, why don't you bother them?  Oh, there's CBS as well?  Yeah, why don't you bother them?  All right.  I'll go bother them.  All right.  Tell her she's got a ton of free advertising right there.  Yeah, she's got so much free advertising.  That's unbelievable.  Oh, she is mad.  She is not happy.  Yeah, I bet.  All right.  What a face on her.  All right.  Mark, hold on the line, all right?  Yeah.  Talk to him.  Make sure nothing's going on.  There's so many people that saw it on TV.  Oh, Paula, what's going on?  I just saw that damn stuff just now, and my God, she actually said to Marsha Clark, 
[03:00:30]  oh, wow, we're neighbors.  Oh, I borrowed a cup of sugar.  No, Hillary wants to give your hubby a hummer.  You have heard of those, have you?  Oh, boy.  Whew.  Okay.  She's a lunatic.  James, you're next on the program.  What's up?  I'm so pissed at you guys.  I'm driving in my car, and I cannot see this.  You better put it on your website.  You have to fix the website.  Oh, it's hysterical.  Yeah, hopefully someone's got to copy that. 
[03:01:00]  We didn't think it was going to happen today, so.  Oh, my God.  I hope they show it on the news or something.  That's the highlight.  Forget Hillary.  That is the highlight.  All right, James, thank you.  See, some guy on the Instant Feedback said the delay really screws with you when you're watching  at home, because it's a 40-second delay from when we're talking to when they're  watching on TV.  Yeah.  So we're saying, move over, move over.  And it was already over.  Right.  Oh, it was complete interactive TV.  You know, you've got to link up our audio with that video from the website.  Yeah, really?  You know what I like on interactive TV?  We're not waiting.  We'll make it ourselves. 
[03:01:30]  Andrew.  Yeah.  What's up?  Guys, I'm watching on TV, and I'm listening to the radio at the same time.  What the last guy said is totally true.  It's the funniest damn thing, because I hear, I see Mark making a total ass, his tongue hanging  out of his mouth, and you guys are like, all right, they're going to cut to you real  soon.  Then they cut away and go to the interview, and I hear you guys scream, move over, move  over, move over, move over.  Funniest damn thing I've ever seen.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  That's funny.  Thank you, Andrew.  All right. 
[03:02:00]  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Well, there you go.  That's from an hour ago, Anthony.  Jesus.  That was hilarious.  I hope people in our company can take a joke, Ed.  I'm sure, Opie.  I'm sure they can.  All right.  Listen, we're going to take a quick break, and then we're going to play a quick round  of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Drown men jumping all over each other.  Okay.  Terrific. 
[03:02:30]  1037.  WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  What a show.  What a show today.  Wow.  I don't think anyone turned off their radio.  Oh, no.  From 2 o'clock on today.  Huge.  Just an absolute huge radio show, and if it's our last...  Oh, don't say that, please.  The first time I heard that, it was.  So, please, I got to be upbeat here.  What a way to go out, though, huh? 
[03:03:00]  Oh, I don't want to go over the job searching again, the interviews, the flights all over  the hell's creation.  Come on.  No.  All right.  Let's play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today, and we'll  get the hell out of here, hopefully.  All right.  Hey, Chris.  Chris, you're first.  What did you learn on the show today?  What's going on?  How you doing?  How you...  We'll see.  All right.  I learned that Psycho Mars got the biggest pair of balls inside of freaking Manhattan. 
[03:03:30]  Baby.  Yes.  Bravo.  Baby.  Absolutely.  All right.  Oh, peace and peace.  I got to go to work.  Peace.  All right, man.  Matt, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Hey, Matt.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up?  I learned that interactive TV is a lot better than a nigger trolley movie.  Jesus.  Yeah.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  See you later.  All right.  Bye.  Bye. 
[03:04:00]  Vanjie, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Hi.  How you doing, guys?  If they would give out Oscars for radio shows, you would win, no doubt.  I mean, you guys are doing too much.  You are so on the money.  I mean, I missed it.  You know, I just heard the last part, and I didn't see the television part.  It didn't matter what part you saw.  If you were just home, and you're in Opie and Anthony's show, and you just happened to  be watching news, and you didn't have the radio show on, it's funny that way.  Oh, no.  If you're just watching and listening to the radio show in your car, it's funny that way.  But if you were fortunate enough to have the radio and the TV on at the same time, 
[03:04:30]  forget about it.  Oh, God.  All right, Vanjie.  I'm so sorry.  I missed it.  I'm watching news tonight, though.  All right, cool.  Happy New Year to you guys.  You too.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Joey, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Hello.  Yeah, you're next, Joey.  Let's go.  What's up?  I learned to stay away from 98-pound brown-eyed girls with eating fetishes.  That goes back to the beginning of the show.  Great show, guys.  If it's your last one, you went out with a bang. 
[03:05:00]  All right.  I love you.  Thank you, Joey.  Take it easy, buddies.  Yeah, please don't say that.  We've got to stay positive here.  Christian, what's up?  What's going on, boys?  All right, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that history always repeats itself.  Boston and New York.  Oh, don't say that.  Oh, man.  Don't say that.  You're just trying to entertain.  Huh?  And bullet wounds should not affect strippers.  All right, very good.  All right, you guys suck.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I won't even say that.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, hey, what's up, Ben, guys?  All right.  I learned today that starting tomorrow, the Opie and Anthony show is going to be replaced 
[03:05:30]  with the Black Earl and Nigger Charlie show.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on, now.  I've got four words for you.  Send Steve the video.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey, hey, I'm his brother.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Bye.  Oh, boy.  Mike, what did you learn on the show today?  Oh, yeah, great show, guys.  Laughing our tails off today.  Couldn't get any work done.  Oh, cool.  But I learned that Marcia Kramer has no sense of humor, and she must really think she's  so freaking important.  All right.  Thank you. 
[03:06:00]  Bye.  Paul, you're next.  Hey, fellas, congratulations.  I've become the kings of all media.  Yeah, all right.  I just want to say that I basically learned to find a woman that refuses to cook.  Definitely.  So you don't have to spend $700 on seven pots.  That's right.  All right.  Very good.  Make it easy, fellas.  All right.  Chris, you're next.  Me?  Yeah.  Yo, how you doing?  All right.  Guys, awesome show today.  Thanks.  Listen, I learned that the George Foreman Grill is a good wedding present. 
[03:06:30]  Very good.  Thank you, guys.  Have a good one.  Bye.  Eddie.  Yeah.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that, Opie, you better have a real big house to house Anthony and Rick and  his wife now.  And I also learned that maybe you guys are going to get nationwide coverage.  If they show that clip on all the affiliates that they have.  I don't think they will.  Yeah, I don't either.  Thank you, Eddie.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, no. 
[03:07:00]  Now I'm getting a little nervous.  I need a beer.  Wayne.  How you doing?  I don't think you guys are going anywhere.  I think your radio show will be here for good.  Oh, cool.  I hope so.  But I wanted to say that I learned if you're a stripper, you better be nice to your boyfriend.  You might get shot in the ass.  Very good.  Yeah, we did learn that today.  Yep.  All right.  Take care.  Hey, did Ed and I say that we love CBS?  Yes.  Welcome home.  Welcome home, everybody.  Absolutely.  Yes.  We love CBS. 
[03:07:30]  Don't forget to tune in David Letterman tonight for the Hillary Clinton interview.  Yes.  Everybody in town talking about it.  What a coup that was.  What a coup.  For Dave.  You know, Jay didn't get that over there on that crappy NBC network.  Yeah, we're not big NBC fans whatsoever.  CBS.  And if anyone, any bigwigs are listening, we don't like Q104.  We don't like PLJ.  We don't like C-100.  K-Rock.  We want to stay right here.  Right now.  Tune in to Kane on K-Rock. 
[03:08:00]  Ted, what's up?  Yo, don't be in agony.  Yeah.  I call you guys, don't be in agony, because you're going to lose your jobs over a wreck  that nobody wants to see in the first place.  Oh, no.  You better not.  I'm just kidding, man.  I love you guys.  All right, man.  Be good.  Bye.  Vic, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, Vic.  Yeah, I missed the whole show today.  Oh, boy.  We keep telling you guys, you know, some days it's kind of boring and a little slow,  but you can't turn off this radio show.  You don't know what you're going to miss.  You never know.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, listen. 
[03:08:30]  Can I come down there and punch that right in the mouth?  Okay.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  When can I come down there?  Tomorrow.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  You know what this show's like?  You remember Jenny Cam on the web?  Yeah.  Well, you'd tune it in, and usually it was a picture of Jenny's empty bed or some clothing,  a pile of clothing on the floor.  Sure.  Or something, or a fleeting glimpse of a hand passing by the camera.  Oh, yeah.  And then, every so often, there was Jenny, spread eagle, naked on the bed.  That's our show.  That's it. 
[03:09:00]  You never know when it's going to be spread eagle on the bed.  Sometimes you've got to sit through a pile of laundry to get to the nudity.  Chris.  Great show today.  I learned that today is your final show in New York.  Oh, stop it.  Good luck to you, and find a new job.  All right, boys?  All right.  Take care.  Thanks.  You guys, that's not even a joke, because we've been through this already.  You know, if we hadn't been through it, I'd be joking.  But we've been through it.  It sucks, and I don't want to deal with it again.  We did this exact same thing where we had an outrageous stunt, and everyone's calling  up going, well, that was a great last show, guys. 
[03:09:30]  Thanks.  Just want to wish you luck in whatever you do next.  And we're all laughing, like, shut up.  I'm going to get fired with the number one show in Boston.  It was our last show, so that's why we're not even laughing at it today.  Jay, what's up?  I want to be the last one to say you guys suck.  All right.  Oh, come on.  And I just want to let you know that you guys need to be touched by an angel if I want  to stay on the air.  All right, man.  Thank you, Jay.  We'll finish with Old Dirty.  Old Dirty.  Bravo. 
[03:10:00]  Bravo.  You spilled my 40, bro.  You spilled your 40 over there?  I spilled on channel, too, kid.  Perfect freaking timing, my man.  I know.  My hat's off to you, my brother.  Great.  Oh, my goodness.  We'll be hanging out with you.  We'll be laughing with you in no time.  Yeah, right.  You're going to start laughing, right?  Yeah, listen to me.  I've got to go in and listen.  Yeah.  You know what I learned today?  That the next house I robbed, I've got to steal some pots.  That's the way all the money goes. 
[03:10:30]  Old Dirty, I've got to cut you off.  We've got to get out of here on time.  All right, baby.  All right.  Peace.  Peace.  And with that, we'll see you guys tomorrow, hopefully.  All right?  Okay.  It's going to be a long walk down that hall right now.  Yeah, it is.  I know.  Because you know what's at the end of the hall, don't you?  Yes, I do.  Do you guys have a moment?  You got a minute?  You want to come in here?  Got a minute?  Boy, they liked us for how long?  A week.  All right, man.  Thanks for listening.  We'll be right back. 
[03:11:00]  We'll be in Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  WNEW. </pre>
