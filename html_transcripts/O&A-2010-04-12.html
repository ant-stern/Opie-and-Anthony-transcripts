<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts (E-Rock, Sam, Norton, and Anthony) lambasting Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's recent acting work and appearances, particularly mocking a Today Show interview.  Sam, in a recurring bit, made numerous self-deprecating jokes about his height, incorporating fantastical scenarios involving Kiss's platform shoes and childish antics with props like a high chair and a "fat gun."  The conversation jumped to smartphones (iPhones vs. Blackberries), Tiger Woods's return to golf after his infidelity scandal, and his performance (along with Phil Mickelson's win) at the Masters Tournament.  A caller described Tiger's behavior as "robotic." The Polish president's plane crash in Russia was discussed, with speculation about the pilot's decisions.  A lengthy, heated debate with a caller, Frank, ensued, focusing on Tiger Woods's negative influence on children.  Other callers contributed to this discussion and to the overall chaotic nature of the segment, which included a commercial pilot discussing Russian pilots’ reputation and a caller sharing humorous observations about a Starbucks incident.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about the negative impacts of overly-protective parenting in youth sports, focusing on participation trophies, leagues where everyone wins, and the resulting inability of children to handle failure and pressure – a point linked to increased college student suicide rates.  Numerous callers shared similar experiences. A caller volunteered to be the show's medical correspondent, prompting a joking threat toward Dr. Steve. Opie then detailed his recent birthday trip to the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, recounting his gambling experiences (including a dealer calling him a "crybaby"),  his continuous playing of Meatspin on his computer, and the lavish high-roller treatment he received, contrasting it with experiences at other casinos.  The hosts also described a wild night out at a Borgata club and the women they encountered.  Numerous "FU Line" voicemails, filled with angry and profane messages, punctuated the segment.  Discussions about the NHL's shootout system, Opie's upcoming date with Taylor Vixen (Penthouse Pet of the Year), and the Nazi trials following the Valkyrie plot against Hitler were interspersed.  Finally, a prolonged, graphic discussion of unusual foods like head cheese, liverwurst, hoggis, and scrapple dominated the end of this segment, including detailed descriptions of head cheese preparation, prompting plans to acquire some for E-Rock to try on air.

The next segment focused on UFC 112, specifically the controversial Anderson Silva vs. Demian Maia fight, including Dana White's furious reaction.  Frankie Edgar's victory over BJ Penn was also discussed, along with speculation about the underwhelming performances.  Bill Burr then called in from the Masters, offering humorous observations about the event's exclusivity and the stark contrast between the perceived snobbery and the reality of heavily intoxicated attendees.  The main event of this segment involved the consumption of the previously discussed head cheese.  The arrival of the head cheese was followed by multiple attempts by studio personnel to eat it, resulting in vomiting and expressions of disgust at its texture and appearance, including the discovery of cartilage and other unidentifiable pig parts.

The final segment continued the head cheese saga, with Joe DeRosa joining the studio and participating in the graphic descriptions of the food's unpleasant qualities and failed attempts at consumption.  Following the head cheese ordeal, the conversation shifted to DeRosa's use of Zoloft, its effects on his libido and emotional state, and his struggles with depression.  The discussion expanded to encompass the broader topics of antidepressants, mental health, and the pressures within the stand-up comedy world, including anecdotes from callers and the hosts. The segment concluded with humorous tangents about a midget from the Wizard of Oz, a comedian's off-stage personality, and DeRosa plugging his upcoming shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hello, it's E-Rock from Opie and Anthony, and Sam from Opie and Anthony.  Once again, Sam, Norton, and Anthony, just not impressed with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.  No, and why would they be? They are pale comparisons to what they used to be.  Well, you be the judge. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro suck here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  There's an obsession going on in this studio. They just showed De Niro and Pacino.  I guess they're doing an interview on the Today Show, and wow.  It looked like De Niro was doing his De Niro impression. 
[00:00:30]  I was commenting before about that. Jimmy said the movie's stinkeroo.  And you could tell, because when do you see De Niro and Pacino sitting in a chair,  waiting for some schlep to interview him about a movie?  Roland told me the only press they're doing, and it's reluctantly, is the Today Show.  Can I get a booster seat?  I got little seats.  I'm short.  I need elevator shoes.  I want to wear the shoes that Kiss wore in 1977. 
[00:01:00]  Just so I could be 5'8".  I would be hysterical walking around with Gene Simmons shoes on.  I got Paul Stanley's chest on my head.  And Peter Criss's wig.  I'm wearing Peter Criss's wig.  There was a movie, I think it was that one where he's in, was it Long Beach?  Was he in that one?  Long Beach.  Long Beach.  Yeah, one of those movies.  I don't know whatever movie it was.  I'll figure it out.  Where he played a cop.  Was that with like Robin Williams or something?  Yeah, of course.  He played a cop.  Maybe that was it.  That was it.  Insomnia.  A cop again.  A cop again. 
[00:01:30]  With my three-quarter length leather.  So I look cool.  And it hides my big shoes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm wearing those little Kellogg's snack packs on my shoes.  If I don't wear the lifts on my feet, my gun scrapes on the sidewalk.  I got little teeny tiny shoes.  I look like Yosemite Sam.  I fire my guns and lift in the air. 
[00:02:00]  Oh!  Darn you rabbit!  Now I gotta go back to the ship and get another match.  I want to see him sitting in the chair with his little legs sticking straight out.  Straight out.  Like a ventriloquist dummy.  He's on Bob's lap.  I got a high chair.  I want to eat some pudding and some gerb.  I'll feed you.  I'll feed you. 
[00:02:30]  I got a fat gun in a sweatsuit.  You know how fat you gotta be for your stomach to stick out in a sweatsuit?  Open up.  Here comes the airplane.  I love the airplane.  Feed me, Bob.  Don't get any on my little booty.  Don't get any applesauce on my booty, Bob.  Yeah.  Or on my Oshkoshbogosh.  It's a little jumpsuit I'm wearing.  Hey, I'm gonna turn my wig upside down.  We can eat Reese's Pieces out of it. 
[00:03:00]  Little hairy ball.  Hairy ball.  That's right.  It's a hairy walk on my head, Bob.  It don't move on the back of my neck.  It looks like a stormtrooper helmet.  My hair's made out of cotton candy.  Stick a pencil in it and twirl it around, boy.  Little chilly, where's my blankie?  Your ticket buys you the whole seat, but you'll only need the edge.  That's right.  Or the space underneath, because my feet never reach the floor. 
[00:03:30]  So I never kick popcorn over.  Because I'm tired.  The O.B. and Anthony Show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  All right, but Jeff, you missed it.  No, you can't punch out because you missed your other point you wanted to make.  You said iPhone is for teenage girls, Blackberry is for grown men.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's why Anthony's got the iPhone.  Hey, look what I got.  Right.  You want one?  Hey, look what app I have.  Do you have this app?  Check this app.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[00:04:00]  I've somehow ended up in photos.  Look at this one.  Spike cock.  Wow.  You rocked Jesus Christ.  Yeah, I noticed that too.  You did?  Dude, what is this?  Your breath is bad.  It's really bad.  Oh, my God.  Really?  I'm sorry because we haven't talked about your breath in a while.  It's turkey and iced tea.  I'll take care of it.  At least he's honest.  Wow, is that bad.  That's rough.  That was rough. 
[00:04:30]  The thing is, we know that he took advantage of his dead father, but the idea is that he's  looking himself and what would his dad say?  Now, instead of him going, here's what my dad say, they had clips of his dead dad saying  shit that could reflect, even though his dad got side pussy.  It was just Tiger.  Yeah, let's not forget.  But it's white guy shit.  Tiger's father did get side pussy.  He was a notorious side pussy guy.  Everyone started shaving their pussies completely bare clean. 
[00:05:00]  They did.  How recently did this happen?  Oh, my God.  This has been happening for years and years.  Oh, my poor bastard.  Yeah.  Looks like raw chicken thighs.  Yeah, I know.  I like my pussy to be adult.  I need something in the hair.  You need a little hair, Patrice.  I like a lot of hair.  A lot.  Problem hair.  Just a lot.  Come down the thigh.  It looks like a pussy.  That other shit looks like trying to do something.

[00:09:30]  let's you know let's be honest with each other no one's doing better radio than than this we  rule google it you're fucking right simple as that fucking believe it this is radio radio  and with that good morning welcome to the ob and anthony show hi i gotta i gotta  start off by saying something really quickly uh i forgot to tell you i'm driving in with kenny  this is starbucks yeah i go kenny pull over i want a cup of coffee so i so i go into starbucks and i go 
[00:10:00]  up to the guy like i'll have a grande coffee my regular order right he looks at me dead serious  he goes we don't have any coffee so then i'm standing there like what exactly yeah  and i'm like i'm i was completely dumbfounded and confused because he he said it like it was  a normal thing to say he goes yeah we don't have any coffee what at starbucks why are you open then 
[00:10:30]  so then i had to awkwardly walk out of starbucks because they didn't have any coffee what was the  you understand that what was the you didn't ask him how could a starbucks not have coffee that's  what you sell he said we have espresso i'm like i want coffee dude i was so dumbfounded i never got  the answer but i would assume maybe somewhere around 5 30 5 whatever time was somewhere around  5 30 i guess yeah that maybe they're changing over the coffee maybe they they empty their vats and get 
[00:11:00]  a fresh batch going i don't know he just he looked at me was here to tell us he looked at me like i was  crazy for asking for coffee at a starbucks and then i'm just standing there like well now what  i've never heard this before i haven't heard that either so we uh got another coffee from another  uh coffee establishment so just a quickie to start the show i'm like that's bizarre think about that  you're going to starbucks they tell you they don't have any coffee yeah and then i looked at i'm like 
[00:11:30]  yeah okay like that that's funny like that's a really good joke for a goal it's a great joke if  you're starbucks to tell the customers you don't have any coffee straight face and then you go i'm  kidding what do you want right but in this case he was dead serious and then i'm looking around like  there's no other reason to be in here maybe he was robbing the joint what am i am i gonna buy some  summer loving cd or something maybe a nice cake a little cakey thing cakey what the fuck anyway 
[00:12:00]  whatever it's cakey don't have to spend all day on it but i thought that was kind of very kind of  weird to say the least no shite uh wow we have uh a lot going on a lot happened over the weekend  oh a lot of sports things sports things earthquakes presidents dying unbelievable polish president  well he's still a president yeah the hell happened there yeah it was a foggy fucking uh  a little fog approach a little foggy coming in pilot couldn't i can't see god damn it 
[00:12:30]  and uh oops clip some trees a little too low a little too low before the old runway and that was  that but uh wasn't the airport basically telling them don't land this plane you can't really see  telling them uh look uh you might want to divert and go to another airport the final say is always  with the pilot right like that they they can take recommendations and stuff but the final say  is always with the pilot as far as if they're going to attempt to land uh unless the airport's 
[00:13:00]  closed um but they recommended that he divert and he didn't he went around uh for a landing once  missed approach circled four times four times yeah then went in for another landing and uh landed on  top of the trees uh you know killing everybody on board they're also saying that the polish president  who has uh overridden the uh suggestions of his pilot uh in the past might have wanted to get to this  memorial service he said he thought that um they had told him to divert so he couldn't make the 
[00:13:30]  memorial service for a bunch of uh polish soldiers that were killed during world war ii um to make  to embarrass him yeah by not showing up so you know russians or whatever the fuck it is wanted to  embarrass him so they would divert his plane so he might have actually told the pilot you land this  fucking plane and whoops but after the fourth go around like you ever i've gone around you ever go  i've gone around one time about to land and all of a sudden you're taking off again you ever have 
[00:14:00]  one of those one only in how scary is that like what is that about it was in vegas and it was uh i  could feel they were going back up and there was a flight attendant sitting next to me on the flight  she goes no no we're landing i go we're going back up and the guy said ah we're gonna have to go  around because we were a little too close to the plane in front of us so we just have to go around  give him some more room it's very scary yeah absolutely yeah the missed approach what is this  memorial the war has been over for a long time i know why are they having a memorial now bunch of 
[00:14:30]  soldiers that were killed in uh world war ii um by the nazis so uh yeah they decided to just you  know have a memorial i guess they do it every year okay it's like a yearly thing yeah yeah and  the president decide to show up at this one well oh they weren't killed by the nazis were they killed  by stalin or some shit i don't know yeah by the soviets they were killed by bullets sorry i don't  want to blame the the nazis for anything jesus really sorry a nazi defender the thought a nazi  defender jumps right hey wait a minute hold on you it's not nazis how dare you suggest a nazi 
[00:15:00]  did something horrific they have a bad enough stigma to deal with don't pour the polish to the  offices on them now let's look let's look like a professional radio show today here's the story  secretary state hillary clinton offered condolences at the polish embassy in washington she signed a  book for polish leaders who were killed in that plane crash saturday president-elect kaczynski his  wife and other political leaders died when their airliner crashed in russia the body of the late  polish president was returned to the grieving nation thousands of poles lined the streets of 
[00:15:30]  warsaw to pay their respects investigators say there's no indication from the flight recorders  of any technical problems with the aircraft air traffic controllers say the pilot defied in order  to divert to another airport there are reports that on previous flights president kaczynski had become  angry at pilots who refused to land yeah you're right ant i i think that's exactly what happened  i don't think any pilot is willing to take a chance and land that plane if if the airport is basically 
[00:16:00]  where air traffic control is uh basically saying divert divert divert no you can't see anything you  you know and and some of these foreign uh airliners not equipped with the most modern systems no as far  as you know uh ground sensing radar and and everything you would need to um to land the plane  completely without any visual right right uh so well it was like a 727 it was russian's version of a 
[00:16:30]  727 which uh hasn't been flying in the u.s as far as a passenger plane goes for quite some time you  would think the president would have a nice new plane sounds like he had an older plane right  aeroflot something from aeroflot let's go to mike in toronto mike first call of the week what's up  buddy mike hey boys what's up what do you got man uh my buddy's a commercial pilot he says if you're ever  in that region like kazakhstan poland anywhere in russia never ever fly they have the worst pilots 
[00:17:00]  they're all drunks their equipment shit i just gotta think that uh if they were flying the president  around they would have had one of the better pilots apparently they did they said well this  was his pilot i'm sure yeah wasn't this was the polish president's plane he didn't hop a russian  airline he probably had a good plane they said the pilot was very experienced it's just fog yeah  just think of obama if that happened to obama they would have had the best pilot in all the 
[00:17:30]  u.s flying him around well i'm sure they have the best pilot in poland they have air force one's  pilot is pretty a pretty good pilot yes or they're a few pilots i'm sure sully is the greatest pilot of  all time we all know that faggot couldn't avoid geese stinks sully greatest pilot of all time  because i challenge you who who is the better crash the plane bottles all the time what two  words chuck yeager chuck yeager what bottles in the cockpit all the time in those russian flights 
[00:18:00]  yeah right yeah go ahead mike you would thanks thanks boys i seriously think there's a problem  with the phones because there always is like i don't think they could hear us very well  so they talk over us all the time yeah because we had a little chuck yeager sully thing that we  were about to start and yeager is the bestest and he kind of messed that up chuck chuck over sully  every time every time yeah at least sully gets into a plane he knows the goddamn thing for the most 
[00:18:30]  part it's gonna fly chuck didn't know he just got in there and fucking flip the switches and hope for  the best let's say hi to matt in jersey matt what's up boy hey hit her matt they're having a problem  in poland because now they got to fly all their flags at half mass so they're having trouble cutting  all the flagpoles in half in time oh okay punch it out i don't know you know the polish jokes come  rolling in you know what though cutting the flag in time that's hilarious though come on so simple but 
[00:19:00]  so funny yeah let's say hi to chris in the poconos chris hey i think this morning you had the white  version of popeye's running out of chicken oh with the whole coffee thing yeah oh you should have  started going where's my coffee where my coffee i i i'm i'm i'm stupefied by this one i'm like what  do you mean you're there's no coffee and he's and he's standing behind the counter like he's ready  for business like he's open he's open for business selling cupcakes he's got his little starbucks

[00:20:00]  gaudy the golfers put it on for i think five seconds five seconds the camera goes off and  they're like get this fucking thing off of me stupid jacket off of me like i know it's tradition  and i would like to know who started the whole green jacket thing because man that guy had just  horrible fucking taste yeah horrible fucking taste no one wears the green jacket i think they force  him to wear the green jacket for a ceremony and that's it i mean what are you gonna do with that 
[00:20:30]  dumb thing hanging on the wall hanging on the wall yeah you do like one of those things like at the  hard rock you know where they put people's shirts and jackets and rock stars and stuff so if you're  phil you just take the jackets and you put them on your wall and your golf trophy room or something  i guess never wear it but uh you're just going out with it to dinner it's like hey is that phil  mickelson yeah see he's got the green jacket on right how do you miss it yeah how do you miss that 
[00:21:00]  it's uh phil mickelson but uh it was a hell of a fucking tournament i gotta tell you  we're looking at highlights right now phil mickelson uh knocking it in from what about 150 160 yards out  yeah that was pretty amazing uh tiger woods had one of those yesterday he he uh knocked it in from  about 150 140 yards out i thought phil was older than 39 years old too he's always looked 39 years old  yeah so now he looks his age finally he looked 39 when he was 28 yeah yeah so pretty good story man 
[00:21:30]  i'm not a huge phil mickelson fan but uh right on good job phil now a lot of people are talking like  you know phil mickelson you know standing by his wife who has breast cancer his mom i think his mother  has breast cancer as well jesus and here he is winning the masters the same year tiger woods was pretty  much fucking everything in sight yeah it's a pretty interesting little twist here i think that he won  the masters i think it took a lot of the uh story away from tiger you know you finally got that out 
[00:22:00]  there like oh look he's back but the whole tournament wasn't about tiger and how he's back and how he  fucked women and this that and the other thing it right turned into you know phil's story well there's  another phil that's uh a little annoyed phil mushnick in the paper was so problem he's so fucking pissed  off with cbs and their coverage of the masters because they showed tiger woods a lot well people  want to see him they're like he wasn't gone for four and a half years he was gone for four and a 
[00:22:30]  half months it's like that's why people were tuning in especially at the beginning and then they you  know you start appreciating what some of the other golfers are doing but at first it was all about  seeing tiger plus the fact that tiger was in this tournament from the beginning to the end he never  made a real run at it but he came in what fourth place so he was in contention the entire fucking time  and why is phil writing about tiger trying to sell papers are you trying to get uh you know your name  out there and attach yourself to the story phil it'll attack his own paper because that part of 
[00:23:00]  the reason they showed tiger exactly was because of the frenzy fueled by his own parent company  he will never bash his own paper like it's like how many times was tiger on the cover of the post or  his mistress is on the cover of the post yeah so come on what a fucking phony this guy is no  what a phony uh shit uh tiger woods waiting to play his tee shot in the fourth hole yesterday took  off four and a half months not four and a half years says post columnist phil mushnik mushnik 
[00:23:30]  mushnik is pissed off today let's think inside the boxes here goes uh there's nothing more important  to know remember and then always know and always remember what yeah no one is bigger than the game  any game as big and bizarre as the tiger woods tale had turned nothing was more incredible or sensational  than the golf thursday through yesterday evening played at the masters nevertheless tv folks continue to 
[00:24:00]  gift tiger woods with an endless supply of the last thing he needs bad excuses when he bounced one over  green late in saturday's round cbs is nick faldo normally prized for his candor applied the thin  alibi that this was the result of woods having not played competitive golf in nearly five months  could have been hold on sir nick this was late round three and woods not only seemed sharp for nearly  54 holes at the start of each season he never played many events before the masters that's not true he gets 
[00:24:30]  a few in and he won four of them he took off four and a half months not four and a half years  yesterday with woods uh starting poorly faldo spoke of him suffering from all he has been through  oh please he's rusty tiger woods showed that he was rusty yesterday you dummy he's having some hard time  with his putts his putts he had some fucking hooks off the off the tee he was yelling at himself which  was fucking classic you like that yeah fucking classic hearing tiger woods yelling at tiger woods 
[00:25:00]  well he was trying to right well yeah it's kind of creepy it is he talks to himself in the third person  and uh well here's here's tiger young and tiger on the t the hole in the upper back right quadrant  you once suck god damn it i don't think he's pleased  tiger woods you suck you suck god did he say tiger woods yeah can you hear that i didn't hear his name 
[00:25:30]  oh yeah oh yeah man he says tiger but gotta play and he got a good jesus christ out on tv yesterday  a big jesus christ and tiger on the t the hole in the upper back right quadrant  tiger woods you suck god damn it i don't think he's pleased i don't think he's pleased  tiger woods you suck that's great how great is that well what makes it great he he he's claiming 
[00:26:00]  that he's gonna be a new tiger he's gonna be more fan friendly and he's gonna yeah he's not gonna show  this crazy emotion anymore i like that oh boy it came out did he always show that oh yeah yeah  yeah he's always been kind of i like that that's great oh yeah yeah i don't care again you know  the guy's pissed off at his performance and uh let's say hi to andrew in south carolina andrew  hey boys uh you were talking about the green jacket it started uh back in the 30s or 40s they gave 
[00:26:30]  them to the members to wear at the tournament so people could know who to ask for directions  they gave the first one as a trophy in the uh late 40s wait i'm i'm confused they gave out the  green jackets so why they gave it to the members to wear at the tournament yeah so the people knew  who to ask for directions they could find a reliable source of information so what you're saying is  what are you saying so so it's basically a page jacket uh i mean i guess that's how it started 
[00:27:00]  parking lot attendant yeah really like the parking lot attendant all wore green jackets and the the  bag room guys and and next thing you know they figured that they should give it to the actual  golfer they they gave the first one out of the trophy and uh i think it was 47 or 48 yeah must  have been a rough year they probably didn't have money for an actual trophy and said ah just give  them the jacket yeah they get to keep it for one year then they got to take it back to that when 
[00:27:30]  they come back to play the next year they got to give it back and it stays at the club how about you  just let them keep their stupid green jackets uh yes you only get one right so phil was wearing his  old one all right the guys he's dead on i mean that's i'm looking it up here and that's pretty much  that's pretty much the reasoning for it is as the green jacket presented to the masters champion  uh let's see the tradition of the green jacket at augusta dates back to 37 that year members of  the club wore green jackets during the tournament so that fans and attendants could easily spot them 
[00:28:00]  if they needed to ask questions you don't ask golfers question while they're in the middle of a  tournament that is weird all right boys punch it out thank you sir let's go to pat in staten island pat  yeah good morning boy hey uh two things what are the odds that tiger would have scored 69  final round 69 which was classic of course it was supposed to end that way and do uh those green 
[00:28:30]  jackets make you horny your phone broke up sir i said do those green jackets we heard you  oh did he fall right into that trap you walked out of that one bomb first  oh fuck jimmy james morning boys the last guy's sock what's up jimmy hey uh did this not turn out  to basically be the best uh opportunity for tiger to come back due to all of the other storylines in 
[00:29:00]  the tournament between the first day at uh freddy couples and tom watson being the oldest two guys  to ever lead the masters uh all of the asians three asians in contention early to be the first  ever asian masters tournament winner and then mickelson coming through for his wife i mean you  yeah it was all about tiger but they also diluted it a little bit with all of the other storylines yeah  there were some great storylines i tweeted yesterday asian golfers are so fucking boring to watch 
[00:29:30]  they're like robots these guys yeah they're really like robots dealers huh like blackjack dealers  same thing emotionless for the most part yep no excitement to their game they're just like they  they're barely in the woods ever drive down the middle fucking hit it to the green yeah two putt or  one putt next hole drive down the middle at 35 miles an hour of course right and then you get tiger 
[00:30:00]  woods he's in the middle of the pine he's in the middle of the pine trees he pops it over the pine  trees amazing and lands 10 feet from the cup you got phil mickelson and i don't know poison ivy and  he's making birdie and then you get the asian golfers down the middle once again fucking hate watching  them did he really hit it over the pine trees it was a ridiculous shot when he needed it how they do  that from like ridiculous he was in the pine trees and had a and had to hit it over launch it straight  up in the air i don't know he had to make that ball go up quick quick he had no room for error none 
[00:30:30]  and then stupid freddie couples and we'll play we'll talk a little golf here if he didn't have a bad back  he probably would have won the masters yeah him in that back of his he had three out of uh three out  of the four rounds were really good and then he had one around i forgot i think it was like he shot  like a 75 or something stiffening up when he's walking and if he shot a basic 70 he was right  in there yeah how good is tiger swing uh it wasn't too good uh but in general it's amazing it is it's  ridiculous some of those guys and i love how they have the microphones right by the tee box there 
[00:31:00]  yeah and you just hear it sounds like a gun going off sometimes when they connect with that ball yeah  i was fortunate enough to be on a tee box when tiger woods um hit a drive when it was out in the  hampton's there yeah the u.s open and i i watched a lot of guys go through and the sound tiger's  fucking driver makes when it hits that ball was unlike anything else i heard that day it was  unbelievable same sound it makes when his wife hits him over the head with it  and you know it's annoying jim carrey's just twittering about tiger and his wife's uh 
[00:31:30]  wait who jim carrey yeah he's twittering his opinions about it yeah  and uh he wrote no wife is blind enough to miss that much infidelity ellen had to be a willing  participant on the ride for whatever reason kids lifestyle and he got some negative responses  um and he wrote i want to make clear that i don't condone infidelity but to some degree the  responsibility is shared by both people it's like why do you have to clarify that and first of all 
[00:32:00]  why are people why is the news picking up what a comedian oh i know yeah yeah it's not news i was  listening to that it's a guy talking some guy just his opinions cares and he's being criticized  and people are outraged that he would do that i kind of fault jim though it's like come on jim  you can't you can't back off on that right outraged at outrage your opinion yeah your favorite caller  frank in jersey frank hey boys what's up how great a tournament was that i uh i enjoyed it but uh i also 
[00:32:30]  had to flip uh i had to flip back and forth between hockey and golf yeah but you know what tiger  finally shit the bed and he showed his true colors come on did you see that putt on i don't know 14 15  he goes to tap it in misses it because he wants to hurry up you know he's got no respect for the game  oh damn i think the guy has a lot of respect for the game has always shown that has shown that  how could you even say that you know at the end when they interview him outside that cabin  okay instead of saying listen i appreciate how everybody stood up for me how the fans came in out 
[00:33:00]  out in droves for me but no he says you know what i come into every tournament to win that's all i do  well i like this guy sir are you doing a parody no this is frank he was very annoying frank well  frank really are you are you one of these guys that thinks that tiger uh didn't have respect for  the game why he's the best at it and he's the only interesting thing in the game for non  golf fanatics yeah he's always showed respect for the game and i like he's the best and i liked after  his round because they were basically trying to say wow you know what tiger after after everything 
[00:33:30]  you've been through you haven't really practiced that much and and this is your first tournament  in four and a half months you got to be pretty proud of what you've accomplished out there and i  like the fact that he said uh no i'm not i entered tournaments to win i think that's great how is that  to me it shows no respect for the game if he's too caught up in the fan applause the fact that he  shouldn't he shouldn't address that he comes there to win he didn't win he's annoyed right why should he be  thankful that they fucking clapped they should have clapped those assholes they're half of the 
[00:34:00]  reason he's in trouble because they couldn't stop buying the papers and watching the shows about his  private life yes you know guys he's out for four months okay if he's in rehab and his wife's not  around what is he doing the rest of the time jerking off to uh porno he's probably out there on some  private course playing every day you know what who cares you know what the paparazzi and all those  scumbags are trying to get a picture of tiger woods hitting a golf ball no one could do it right so if he  was able to fucking practice during uh during that time then i don't know where he was doing it 
[00:34:30]  the guy had a bad tournament he's probably nervous he knows the whole fucking planet is focused on him  more than normal honestly he had a good tournament considering everything he's been through for him  right but i like the fact that he didn't cop out and go yeah i'm pretty psyched that i came in fourth  he was like no i'll fucking want to win this thing i like that how is that no respect for the game  shots he made were just incredible i agree but how is that no respect for the game the fact the guy's  annoyed because he didn't do what he felt his job was he's to me showing tremendous respect for the  game by not just being pleased that they clapped for him he's mad that he didn't win which is what 
[00:35:00]  he feels his job is that's tremendous respect for the game jimmy how fake is it when he's tipping his  hat looking like he's forcing all that again that's not the game everything that tiger does dude don't  switch subjects everything he does is robotic don't switch so what that's his personality he's also the  greatest golfer right so whatever it is it works frank i don't disagree with you on that point i i  do think that was a little forced this uh this past weekend definitely like when like when a pitcher 
[00:35:30]  comes out or a hitter comes out and tips his cap sometimes tiger was known for not really doing  that and for you know he's trying to be this new tiger so he's knowledge the crowd he's trying to  be a little more fan friendly and it did that part i do agree with frank it seemed a little forced  at times and then when his game when he started realizing that oh my god this masters is slipping  away from him then you got to hear him like going you know tiger woods you suck jesus christ you know  he was he was very close to fucking you know snapping golf clubs so how did he show no respect for the 
[00:36:00]  game how great was it watching freddie though frank how did he show no respect for the game you  haven't said one thing that said he didn't you've said i just showed just the opposite  no respect for the game in the way he's treated the fans all this time the fans of the game wait  wait let me i'll answer the question okay okay golf is entertainment okay we pay for them to be on  the course that you know what i mean we we pay for the tickets we pay for the cable networks we pay  for the companies that that uh sponsor the events okay he should treat us with respect that's no respect 
[00:36:30]  for the game okay you're really you're really reaching because you lost the point frank hey i'm not  reaching you're reaching because you lost the point how come here on on twitter and on aol and  all these other sites they're saying that he's the only one they how many golfers were out there  you hear anybody else yelling saying god damn it tiger you sucker you know god damn it or this or  that nobody else is out there doing that so what i like that that's his way i like that he does that  and there are other golfers that if he was a guy you liked frank you'd be going wow he's really a 
[00:37:00]  rebel he's a maverick he's really he's a guy who brings it like when mark fidrich a bad example  would kick around the rosin bag on on the mound hey that guy's an original you just don't happen  to like this guy so you're saying he's an asshole and he has no respect for the disagree you have  you have young guys young kids girls and guys watching tiger and emulating tiger frank stop  frank really no no no frank don't go down that road frank please you're embarrassing yourself  don't go down that road frank are you that's not tiger woods's responsibility whatsoever are you a 
[00:37:30]  parent i'm a parent and i'm a coach okay well then how about this as a parent you're responsible  for your kids a hundred percent because if they succeed all you're going to do as a parent is  take credit as to how well you did as a parent you're not going to credit tiger so if they fuck  up don't in any way shape or form look to him it's always a negative it's amazing why wasn't it last  year before anybody knew this as a parent i guarantee you wouldn't have said how great he was for your  kids because he was doing the positive things you would have taken credit as a parent but now if 
[00:38:00]  there's a negative okay then you look at somebody like bill clinton right what about him okay here  people he's the president united states you're supposed to look up to him and all of a sudden  he gets caught with uh stains on a dress right okay and now you know he's not a great president  anymore i didn't say that people don't you know that's what people were saying but think for  yourself they have a right to say that because the guy was a fraud frank no they don't think for  yourself the difference is the media jfk was fucking putting marilyn monroe on a spigot with rfk 
[00:38:30]  they all do it there was allegations that nixon had a a chinese mistress they all do it the  difference is the way things are covered these days so stop acting like sin is a new thing don't  be naive me as a parent and a coach when i see kids you know chest pumping and doing stuff like  that because of of a play they should have made you know i discourage that as a coach oh wait okay  because you know that that's not what it's all about you know the good kids the kids that are really  talented baseball players or a good teammate you know what they're quiet they go 
[00:39:00]  about the game it's business to them okay what are you a swim 20 years ago cameras and lockers  hey i make the tackle he gets up from the tackle and that's it boy oh and now it's now some guys  getting paid four million dollars to be on special teams and make a tackle in football and the guy  gets up and pumps his chest hey i'm the best i'm the best you bullshit i don't want to lie okay frank  i do in a way i want to see all that you just made my point thank you because you're just saying  that the guy who jumps up and celebrates for doing what he should do is not is is is disrespecting 
[00:39:30]  the game well then tiger all tiger just did was do what he should do and complain when he didn't get  it done and not and not take the false accolades because he showed up and the fans were nice to him  you just kind of you just contradicted yourself dude no i didn't he said you know what he made a mistake  and he said god damn it tiger you suck i don't need to hear that i don't want my kids to hear that  oh dude stop being so naive frank god frankie what's wrong with you stop with the kids  arguing frankie you sound like the kids you see you never curse in the house frank you never allow 
[00:40:00]  your children to watch any film with profound how old are they first of all i got a 12 and a 15 year  old wow so none of them have any friends that curse or they never see pg-13 films that have that  type of language in it huh hey you know what when i'm i'm not asking yes or no do they yes they have  okay well then don't act like with them okay i'm there to help censor what's going on i'm going  to sit and hey look this isn't exactly what you should be hearing okay i know that you talk to your  friends like that okay you really say that during a movie do you really during a movie say that to 
[00:40:30]  your kids if i'm sitting home and somebody yells fuck right okay and there's a 12 year old and a 15  year old watching that movie i say something about it okay i care if they go out and they and they  treat other people with respect i have kids on some of my teams no lie they talk back to the  coaches there's no respect out there anymore so to me you sound like a guy who's bitter about other  stuff or annoyed about other stuff were you an athlete and you wanted to go on to professional  sports no not at all okay because you seem like you have this this what's that i play golf i'm a 
[00:41:00]  pretty decent golfer so but how come it's okay during a movie then to explain that to your kids  but when tiger yells that why don't you just give them the same rational explanation  i wasn't watching with them yesterday so what happens they heard it and what do you think the  results were you know what it's something that goes on in everyday life for them right okay then  hey you know it's okay to say it because it's out there it's okay to say it now instead of saying  hey you know what that's not the right thing to say that's the example we're setting for our kids 
[00:41:30]  so wait you think that tiger woods yelling god damn it on playing golf is a bigger influence than you  as a good parent huh well you know what when it's on every sport that's not what i'm asking you  than what are you asking me you think that that that an athlete's behavior well if you're a good  parent how is an athlete's behavior more influential than you as a parent you i'm what about the people  that aren't good parents i'm not talking about that we're talking about you i'm not talking i don't 
[00:42:00]  think for the people you know i think i'm a really good parent okay and i and when he said something  i say to them look this is what not to do so did your 12 and 15 year old come to you and say  daddy we heard the word god damn it and we don't know what to do and then you had to sit down with  them i mean we're going to be very honest and realistic with each other that happened  come on 12 and 15 year old if they say god damn it they're going to run the other way so i don't  hear it then don't use that phony thing about the kids might hear it frank come on what are you doing  you're being phony i'm not being phony this is this is in front of everybody but jim you know what 
[00:42:30]  listen 25 30 years ago that that would have been appalling okay we as a society yes a black guy  playing golf would have been appalling 25 or 30 years ago frank hey you know what that would  have been too okay but it doesn't it doesn't make it right that it's now mainstream so when they  advertise okay but when they advertise alcohol you're watching a baseball game with your son  do you make sure that you point out that the alcohol isn't quite they're making it seem in  the commercial and that you know people paralyze each other in cars i mean is that what your 
[00:43:00]  concern is too oh is that what is that what alcohol is all about they paralyze each other in cars  now i'm gonna oh you know i'm sitting watching a game with my buddies and i can drink a beer  that's what alcohol is about yeah i'm talking about what the results of it usually are years old  you say i said to my kids look you're 12 and 15 you have kids in junior high and high school that  drink don't do it it's not the right thing to do you're not 21 years old it's not the legal thing i  mean frank you're talking if you're so concerned with tiger yelling god damn which i don't think you are  i think you're i think you're using the kids thing as an excuse like a lot of people do you just 
[00:43:30]  don't like the guy and that's fine you don't like him but to me you're being phony by using  him as an excuse hey jim i disagree you know i called up on friday and i basically gave you guys  my point and opie's like let's get this guy in you know if you got me in and we sat and talked you  know what kind of guy i am i can hear it by talking to you i thought i was coming in today that i coach  with they know what kind of guy i am i don't give a fuck what people think about me yes i can i can hear  what you kind of got your friend frank frank but good coach i'm not saying you're not i'm not saying 
[00:44:00]  you're not a good parent but you're to me you got other stuff going on you don't like tiger woods  and you're being phony in the fact that you're not just coming out and saying i don't like this  cocksucker you're saying he's he's disrespecting the game how uh the way he tipped his hat to the  fans you had nothing i completely smashed your point about how he was disrespecting the fans and  then you went into i mean how he was respectful to the game and then you go into he didn't tip his cap  right jim the whole his whole golf career and what he's done as far as playing golf he's not 
[00:44:30]  phony okay playing the actual game he's not funny but he's disrespected the game by the way he's acted  on and off the on and off the course off the course so because he was fucking women behind his wife's  back that disrespected the game it absolutely is wow are you childish that's happening in every  sport out there that's that shit is happening everywhere whole bravado was bullshit i mean  he's the best golfer alive i mean i think he is there's rumors i i don't know because i didn't 
[00:45:00]  do my own research on this that phil mickelson has like a love child out there oh because the big  story about how he is standing by his wife with this breast cancer and stuff and winning the masters  is a nice story today but people have uh i don't know if it's true but people have said that uh  supposedly he's got a love child in ohio who's your favorite athlete if you don't mind me asking you  frank probably derrick jeter okay so this i'm not going to say what they are i talked friday about  pretty couples okay i'm not i'm not in awe of anyone no no hold on frank i'm not saying you are 
[00:45:30]  but do you think that derrick jeter has disrespected this i can't say what the rumors are but there are  rumors circulating about jeter that are really not pleasant and they have nothing to do with  baseball and uh do you think he's disrespected the game if any of these rumors are true i don't  at all if he's come out if he's done something okay on the scale or in scope of tiger in a way  he has because he's let his image be out there for millions of kids oh god with the kids frank 
[00:46:00]  stop with you know what you got it you have to go back to the kids no you don't no you don't  you gotta go back to the game exactly derrick jeter gets paid 20 million dollars yes to play a game  exactly and us as fans pay for him to get 20 million dollars yes to play the game you don't  dictate the rest of his life but it goes you know it goes hand in hand you can't you can't disseminate  the two yes you can if you're an adult you can i'm a big boy i like to watch derrick jeter hit 
[00:46:30]  the baseball who he sticks his dick in has nothing to do with me it's none of my goddamn business  so i guess mickey mantle disrespected the game then because he was a drunk so was babe ruth right  babe ruth was and i guess dimaggio disrespected the game because all these allegations about  spousal abuse came out afterwards huh i guess ty cobb disrespected the game because he hated blacks  it was a piece of shit in his personal life wow i guess there's been nobody gonna hold on frank  hold on i guess nobody has been respectful of the game according to frank the coach's standards 
[00:47:00]  i disagree with that most of the guys are respectful of the game like who okay  like who tom watson freddy troubles jack nicholas i can't not just golf other sports i know the  players more didn't freddy couples have a gambling problem frank we talked about that on friday yeah  well how is that respect of the game yeah that could be a little rough how did it affect the game  well you know he you know kids are also looking up to a freddy couples and and it turns out that he 
[00:47:30]  had a bit of a gambling problem golf tiger is the only interesting thing in golf you golf fans love  golf that's great but i'm a fucking viewership dropped 50 when he left he's done more for that  goddamn stupid sport than any athlete the last 50 years he made it cool for kids mainstream they don't  care that he's fucking girls that just makes it cooler he made it cool for everybody but i'm saying  kids don't watch golf it was an old man's game before uh tiger came around all that did him 
[00:48:00]  fucking pouring your girls is encourage everybody to grab a golf hat right all right frank come on i  know you don't agree because you i'll punch out and listen to the rest of the show i appreciate it  all right right from jersey we do have we do have a responsibility out there at least all right you're  a parent do the right thing you're a parent i'm a coach and the reason i get involved is because i  want to do the right thing it's because you're a nudge frank the right thing hey buddy if i don't get  credit if i don't get credit for those fucking kids doing well i don't want to hear a fucking  thing when they don't do well i don't care you're a parent do your job as a parent i'm a comic i'll 
[00:48:30]  do my job as a comic tiger's a fucking golfer hit the ball cocksucker into the hole and then go put  your dick where you want it's your business there you go i would rather see him keep that image be  the bad boy all right be what tiger's really supposed to be do that image i'd love to see it or how  about being an adult and realizing that his job is not to have an image for you it's to hit a ball in a  hole hey dude you know it's not about me having an image for me it's it's an image about having an  image for the kid no it's not you're lying you're lying you're lying you want people to buy nike hats 
[00:49:00]  you're lying frank yeah jim you're lying you don't know what you're talking about yes i do you're  being emotionally manipulative you're one of these people that because you can't win an argument about  tiger woods you think your ace in the hole is kids you see you're like you're like the liberal  saying hate speech or the conservatives saying family values you don't like what tiger did and  you know that that sounds pompous and that's not enough so you have to find a reason why other people  should side with you no one gives a shit about what tiger did and how it affects your children or 
[00:49:30]  anybody's children you know i i feel that tiger did a disservice to me personally that that's because  you're self-centered the extreme you shouldn't that's what you should have bought in to begin with yeah  these guys are human beings i mean look at michael jordan the greatest basketball player of all time  he had his issues too yeah did jordan disrespect the game and he did a lot for kids how about magic did  he disrespect the game all right somebody just said that michael did a lot for kids what does tiger 
[00:50:00]  do for kids that doesn't matter did michael disrespect the game did did uh did magic johnson disrespect the  game sometimes they did all right well it's happening all the time nonsense what you're saying  to come back and say hey i'm sorry for what i did to the game bryant okay was a little he was a naughty  boy in that hotel room yeah he was a real naughty boy in that hotel all right all right frank we go  all day yeah frank you just don't like tiger you're probably very jealous of him you're one of those  jealous guys who just didn't get as far as he wanted to get and you're you're you're sounding off 
[00:50:30]  on people who are successful like they're not doing their jobs right yeah the bottom line is he is  it's not tiger's responsibility to raise your kids or anyone's kids i never said if it helps a  little bit because he had that nice image out there great but it's in the end it's not his  responsibility hey you know you guys had a replay over the weekend about that uh back and forth with  jesse jesse ventura about him getting up and stomping out of the studio yep okay you're calling  all these names jimmy don't don't bash my character i'm not running away i'm listening to what you have 
[00:51:00]  to say i didn't i'm giving you an honest answer back yes i'm not a i'm not a guy that is angry  because tiger woods is famous i'm bashing your character frank not i'm not saying you're a bad  man but i'm bashing what you're saying because i think it's inconsistent i think it's shit and i'm  sick and tired as somebody who has to in my line of work here the the kids i'm so tired are you a  parent i'm so no that's no frank let me finish that's the beauty of it i don't give a shit about 
[00:51:30]  your kids i didn't pump a load into somebody i dump it on prostitutes and in my own hand  that's why i'm not a parent as a responsible 41 year old man i have made a decision that i don't  want kids so i do adult things for adults take your own fucking the results of your own orgasm  and fucking be responsible for it i don't give a fuck hey that's good i'm glad you decided not to  procreate because we don't want any more jim norton's out there exactly you're gonna attack me a  little bit you're gonna get it back frank that's you can attack me all you want i'm attacking the 
[00:52:00]  bullshit i don't care about not i don't know you as a man i don't give a fuck about your kids all  listen i got greg in dc another coach on the line greg you got frank from jersey go ahead hey good  morning boys hey frank you know i'm a coach and i'm a teacher and i'm sick and fucking tired of  parents like you who say when my kid is in my house i will raise them but the second they're out  of my house it's somebody else's responsibility takes a village and make sure that your kid 
[00:52:30]  instead of letting tiger woods be the golfer your kid should look up to what's wrong with you being  the guy who takes your kid out onto the golf green and says you know what you see that jerk over there  who's pumping his chest that's stupid don't do that that's called coaching that's called parenting  it's not called whining like a little bitch on the radio i'll tell you what you get in touch with 
[00:53:00]  the people in marsh county where i coach in new jersey and they're going to tell you what kind of  dad i am and what kind of notice how you're not answering what i've said you're not talking about  what i just pointed out you're not telling me how you parent when your kid's not in the house  you're telling me to talk to other people i'm talking to you i didn't tell you to call the  parents of my kids that i teach i didn't tell you to call the parents of the people that i coach  i told you how to coach you have yet to say how to coach you just keep telling jimmy how to empathize 
[00:53:30]  with you because you had something grow in your wife and then it fell out  that's a good one that's a damn good one i bet you're one of those coaches that you know what i'm  only going to play the best guy because he's going to help me win absolutely not that's probably  in the varsity league i only play the good kids because in varsity that's what it's about you know  when they're younger it's about playing but you can attack my coaching because you've never seen it 
[00:54:00]  dummy why don't we talk about what we both know you're calling me names look at you you're calling me  names you're a teacher and you got to call me names to argue with me you have to just said you're a  dummy you have to call me names why am i a dummy because i don't i don't agree with what you just  said no no no you're a dummy because you say tiger woods let your kid down and it's about the children  really when was the last time children bought a license as a teacher you're supposed to children 
[00:54:30]  bought a lincoln navigator  tiger woods gets paid to advertise they don't they buy gatorade well you know what tiger woods does  power aid now why don't you as a parent say tiger woods is a bad person you don't drink power aid  anymore hey you know we don't okay i'm not gonna i'm not gonna support something that he that he's uh  what do you drive what do i drive yes i drive a corvette and a chevy cobalt i got two different 
[00:55:00]  cars so okay so you don't drive a lincoln like tiger used to advertise for good for you have you  ever had gatorade not a long time no it has nothing to do with you know people you're gonna sit here and  say oh you know you're a bad coach or you're gonna buy products you know what it's a matter of being a  good person and being a good matter of raising your own kid and not putting that onus on somebody else  not saying tiger woods let my child down bullshit he let his wife down and his own kids down not 
[00:55:30]  your kid play it back play it back did i say tiger let my kid down no i said tiger's got a mouth that  he should have kept in check he's got an attitude what you said was tiger let the kid down go ahead  play it back i said tiger built a reputation based on a falsehood okay that he's full of shit okay  he built a reputation no no people said tiger woods was this way tiger woods never came out  in your classroom what happened given the opportunity i'd never fuck a bunch of women 
[00:56:00]  no one asked him you teach tell me what grade do you teach i teach middle school and i coach high  school i work with different ages okay if you coach high school and you coach let's say you coach  lacrosse and you're up by seven goals in the last five minutes you put the other kids in that haven't  played you let everybody play not on varsity varsity is about winning junior varsity is about  learning how to play on jv they play and they get better on varsity if we're up seven one in the final 
[00:56:30]  in towards the end of the game yeah i will rest a few people but that's a team sport we're talking  golf when i coach swimming which is one of the sports i coach that is an individual sport based  on uh overall scores that the whole team can win and you know what i'm not gonna do i'm not gonna  i'm not gonna swim my worst swimmer in a great race just because i think that my worst swimmer needs 
[00:57:00]  a little more help i'm gonna play my best swimmer in every race that they're good in and if they  and just secretly videotape the worst swimmers from lockers i'm not gonna care they swim in the pool  they do well in the pool if they treat me badly out of the pool they're not gonna play because i'm  their coach but if they're not doing well in school guess whose problem that is their parents  not mine you know what happens when their kid curses at the pool their parent has to take care of it 
[00:57:30]  i'm not gonna walk up when you're in a classroom and say you know what i don't like your potty  mouth i'm gonna go to their parent and say guess what your kid needs to shape up you need to do it  there you go what do you do in the classroom situation when you got a kid that's unruly  and you know that the parenting at home is not anything near what sports is we're not talking  about how well tiger woods reads and because he was such a good reader and handed in a bunch of book  reports he got sex from a bunch of women we're talking about sports and people like you look up 
[00:58:00]  to people for the fact that they hit a ball that is true who do i look up to okay phil mickelson  blah blah blah other golfer name someone insert name here okay you know what i think hey i think fred  is a good play i think fred's a good golfer okay i look up to because of his golf skills and that's it  was no point behind your statement dude and there's dead air you're getting destroyed frank you 
[00:58:30]  know that keep talking he said he looks up to fred couples because he's a good player well i look up  to tiger woods because he's a good golfer that's all i give a shit about it was a douchebag okay and  did the things that tiger did uh what a fucking phony this guy listen get him i we're we're done with  we're done we got to move on this could go all day frank you made your points i appreciate your phone  call from uh jersey there and greg in dc uh people saying best phone call ever thank you 
[00:59:00]  what a phony all right thank you i call back a lot i'm the teacher who schooled you about haiti  ah fuck yeah all right i like i like fred couples because he's a good player yeah but tiger because  of other shut up right that's that that's the reason that guy's good to listen to is that is  actually there are really people that think that way that really think that what what's going on in  their home with their parents should somehow be our responsibility and someone to temper what we  do because the kids you got to sit down with your kid don't give a fuck you gotta sit you gotta sit 
[00:59:30]  down with the kid and tell him what's up exactly if you don't in the end yeah if i'm gonna get equal  blame i would love some credit hey thank god for jim norton uh what he did because it helped the kid  or thank god for you know come on uh john in texas you got to make it fast because we got to take a  break and regroup here what do you got all right so you get a football player that flips someone off  at the end of a game he gets fined tiger woods is out on the green or out on the fairway whatever  and he says god damn it tiger you suck or says jesus christ says jesus christ so what's the deal 
[01:00:00]  there well it's up to the individual sport golf just doesn't have those rules in place where they  uh you know scold the golfers for cursing on the golf course and i and i like that and i i like when  they do it in football too i want to hear it all well i want to hear real emotions when guys are  playing sports i like that i don't understand when the nfl goes look don't show any emotion  you know during a sporting event uh to me that doesn't make any sense well golf is a little bit  more uppity uppity more highfalutin than what football is and i don't understand why you know 
[01:00:30]  a football player gets fined for something like that yeah john i mean you bring up a good point i mean  the answer is simple uh you know the pga just doesn't have those rules in place they let their guys uh  you know express their anger at a bad shot and if they decide to mike the goddamn uh players  right uh you know tiger's just out there in the middle of the the fairway yelling at himself but  you know the network decided to mike him and then decided to air it sure so right yeah the network 
[01:01:00]  doesn't have to air you're right they can go on a delay and beep it right and uh finally pete in jersey  before the break pete uh make it quick because we really gotta uh stop here pete hey boys what's up  good morning long time listener i guess i got nothing those two yenta coaches just wore me out  listening to them line back it was like some retard version of mike and mike in the morning the one guy  was good though i mean at least he wasn't a baby just the frank i think is just a baby how many kids  drive a lincoln navigator that was a good one that's right i just love you guys man i'm coming off 
[01:01:30]  a 24-hour shift i was driving home and you guys cracked me up especially jimmy love listening to  you guys um i want i was gonna volunteer to be your medical correspondent you know a lot of times  medical shit comes up on the show and you guys need a little backup knowledge dr steve he's gonna  get real mad at you he's the man oh fuck dr steve we'll be in the parking lot the best guy wins  all right well next time dr steve's on you call and you can go out with him and if you could beat him  then maybe we uh kick dr steve to the curb chains and knives all right brother all right man 
[01:02:00]  right on holy jesus there you go well i like that those two guys went at it though because  that's that's too that's that's what's going on out there you do have you do have coaches that want  everyone to play and everyone feels special and then you have other coaches that no man we want  to fucking win the you know the game yeah frank seems like one of those coaches that was like you  know oh well to say we'll sacrifice a victory just as long as everybody gets to play i'm not i'm not  a fan of that competition is part of competition and that's why by the way all these college students 
[01:02:30]  are jumping out windows because they've never been taught how to lose they've never been taught  that things aren't going to go their way right so what's happening is and you and it's all this  great coaching where it allows everybody to play no one loses and there's no consequences and it's a  timeout nothing ever hurts and then they get into college you dumb parents and they have no idea  how to handle failure it's like or real pressure yeah or or conflict they don't know how to do it 
[01:03:00]  because all your fucking shitty parenting and all of your fucking patting them on the head and  coddling when they're alone at college they don't have that so what are they doing they're throwing  themselves off the fucking balcony because they cannot handle the pressure that they're facing i kind  of like that point so it's all that shitty fucking no score kept yeah uh that that to me is the  mentality that's forcing these honestly it doesn't make sense because in the real world it's the  complete opposite yeah complete opposite go for a job interview and be unprepared you're out you  don't get it out you don't get it not everyone gets the job but i guess uh you gotta learn early 
[01:03:30]  how to compete i think that'd be the best you could be but but i mean when you have these fucking  these these leagues where everyone plays they don't they don't keep score i i really it's it's one of  the things i find so insane out there so fucking insane i think it's to me it's because the parents  are lousy and they're fucking lazy and they don't want to tell their kid that there is dignity in  losing and it's okay to lose the game they don't want to see their kid hurting i understand that but 
[01:04:00]  but that as a parent is something you got to deal with and and and get past so instead of like dealing  with real hurt that your kid is feeling because he he sucked in a game it's like no man i can't handle  that we got to find a league where everyone plays and there's and everyone is a winner in the end  that's just crazy because that's you're not preparing your kid for the real world and what  they're doing is over emphasizing the importance of the sport by doing that because they can't say  to the kid the sport is just it's fun it's nonsense the fact that you lost eight to nothing means 
[01:04:30]  nothing it's irrelevant they have to make it look like the sport is the important thing so no score  can you understand like the fact that if the kid's hurting because he lost how about being a good  parent and picking the kid up and telling him it's so unimportant that you lost the fact is you gave  it a shot how about emphasizing that you gave it a shot and you came up short but coming up short's  not the important thing it's the fact that you gave it the shot right that's your shitty parenting  out there you're lazy fucking parents plus you also learn what you're good at but if your kid is  sitting there thinking he's really good at baseball because everyone's a winner and there's no no one's 
[01:05:00]  keeping score this kid is you're doing him a disservice he's never going to learn that maybe he could  have been the next uh fucking great musician or or the next great writer or the next great fucking  fucking broadway actor i don't know you know you do have to learn what you what you suck at when  you're growing up that's that's that's what we did you know why i didn't fucking pitch in in in high  school and in college because i found that i wasn't good at it when i walked in eight runs without  getting a batter out i found out the hard way and you what the coach didn't say hey jimmy your feelings 
[01:05:30]  are important you should pitch the next game because the fucking outfielders were out there for three  hours nobody acknowledged my dog shit performance i never pitched again as i shouldn't have  and listen to this god i'm so sick of these fucking parents mick in jersey mick hey guys what's going  on hey buddy another touch on your point there is my daughter uh last year got a participation trophy  which is even worse than everybody playing on the team now can i ask you something does the daughter 
[01:06:00]  bring that home and is she proud of it because she doesn't know any better or do you tell her like  yeah she brought it home and my wife and i explained to her how she shouldn't have got it  and we threw in the garbage thank god it's just for participating you get a trophy no what what's so  special about that nothing what is special about a participation trophy there's something else you  could give every kid at the end of the year that makes them feel good that they were you know part of  this fucking team but to give everyone a trophy is bizarre and this is what but this is where i think  this is why i was calling frank phony this is the phony shit getting everybody to play it's not about the 
[01:06:30]  kids it's about the fucking parents in the stands that cannot handle when their kids don't play  these are the same asshole parents that fucking fight at soccer games they scream at the umpires  that was a goddamn strike these same shit parents yeah cannot handle when their kids don't play isn't  good enough to play they can't handle it so they can't handle it yeah put my kid in well no he's not  good enough fuck you he's the best no he sucks because they don't and by the way he's gay yeah 
[01:07:00]  exactly exactly he's holding the bats in his asshole he doesn't know of them so to me that's  that's where that phoniness comes in it's not about all the kids it's a bunch of fucking parents  whose egos are bruised when their kids are shit it's a it's amazing that uh they got that accomplished  out there though because it is it is rampant man they got sick of parents screaming it is every  fucking where i have a lot of nephews and nieces and in sports and uh it's unbelievable it really  is unbelievable i told you the one with the fucking football where if if the team is up to uh too much 
[01:07:30]  the the offense has to fucking uh sit out until the team comes back yeah sure it's great or the defense  how do they whatever but they sit i i guess they sit their offense sure that was scoring all the  points so now the offense they're basically being penalized for being really good at the sport yeah  now they have to sit out so as a young kid wouldn't you like hold back a little bit because  you want to keep playing and what is that teaching anybody nothing it just shows the parents hey look  your kid got to play that's all it's about right is the parents so stop with the phony altruism with 
[01:08:00]  kids right it's it's you fucking arrogant annoying parents you should teach your kid good sportsmanship  i mean when you fucking kick the ass out of another team you should fucking show some sports  absolutely all that shit ha ha ha ha ha uh  kathy yeah hi kathy hey um i just wanted to you guys talking about sports how about teachers that  are told even if they didn't hand in hand in anything you still got to give them a grade they 
[01:08:30]  can't fail right yeah that's happening in schools now i could oh yeah this is happening in schools  where they're sort of getting away with grading yeah they're kind of getting away with it anthony  because kids can't take it that they might have failed something yep they can't get zero that's  why fucking china is going to take over the goddamn world thank you you know those little bastards are  still competing and fucking you know making it hurt working in factories right lead paint i'm out of 
[01:09:00]  connecticut strong when i was uh when i was playing pop corner football like for like five or six years  we won maybe three games total and you learn how to win from losing it taught me how to like  suck it up and be a and be a human being you know the world's just not going to hand you everything  right well that's the that's why this is not good because when they get into the real world they  realize it's it's not like how they thought it was when they were playing all these sports where  everyone wins and everyone gets to play and you know um you're doing your kids a disservice you really 
[01:09:30]  are they had to build a fucking glass partitions in the library at nyu because students were throwing  themselves off the top and that is a i my opinion a direct result of this fucking this annoying  everybody is equal parenting because it does not train them for real pressure i don't know how to  handle it i like you i like your point jimmy i wonder if uh the suicide rate has gone up to a  to a level where it would make sense i just we just hear about it all the time now in colleges there's 
[01:10:00]  so much stress put on it this is the first time they've ever had to compete they're competing for jobs  they don't get the right scores they don't get into the right grad school they don't get the right  job they didn't have to compete growing up they're like what is this feeling this is weird right yeah  absolutely like i don't understand this feeling because no one taught uh this to me when i was  younger dan in atlanta dan what up dude hey man two years ago 2008 uh georgia state high school football 
[01:10:30]  championship was a tie game they did not go into an overtime because they didn't want anybody to feel  like a loser that's so these kids are starting in in like at ohio state university and university  of georgia right now and it was it was almost a mockery you know right is that really true that  sounds completely crazy google it google it google it google it uh we can continue with this we should  take a break though the phones are now fucking lit my daughter got a ninth place ribbon for running track 
[01:11:00]  and she never crossed the finish line you don't even have to finish the sport to get a fucking  fucking trophy ninth place you don't even have to finish they only go to third i mean really you  can just sit on the bench go you know what just give me the last give me the place trophy yeah looks  just as good as the first place trophy so why why bother all right wow we got you guys uh fucking  calling now holy shit all right we'll we'll take a break maybe we'll continue with this and get into

[01:15:00]  had a nice fun weekend  well the wonderful um borgata uh sent me a birthday present they sent me a little birthday gifts and  things like that so uh the ups guy comes in and i and i got this uh this big box i open it up and  there's one of those um hp touch screen computers ever see those things it's a computer but you touch 
[01:15:30]  the screen and it's got like a you know like a iphone screen touch thing you know you can just move  things around with your fingers on the monitor yeah right there wow that's the that's what they they  they gave me they must have missed my birthday birthday yeah anthony my birthday's coming on what  the fuck it's real nice it's nice and uh so i was just like hanging around thinking you know 
[01:16:00]  why don't i just go i just go down there so we called up keith and uh he arranged everything they send  uh uh the car and uh went there got there saturday afternoon stayed until about sunday afternoon and uh  had a great time i was a little more i was a little more controlled this time than i'd normally been  in the past uh i find i can now i'm very self-conscious of going black jacks and seven please 
[01:16:30]  so i'm kind of just like seven please because all i think of is jimmy making fun of me  so i can't do that but um so basically you bought yourself a computer yeah yeah that's pretty  much what happened um and then it got to the point one one dealer was just you know dealing  me crap cards and just pulling the magic cards out of their ass and uh i was like jesus christ can 
[01:17:00]  you deal me something you deal me something you know and i've just been pounding him like this for  for a while and he turns around to me and goes uh you want the uh cards or should i get your box of  tissues and i just start laughing he's calling me a cry baby are you crying are you crying a little  bit i was like come on these cards they suck that must be wrong with you must have been a bad run  at that point oh it was it was just like sucky cards i keep getting 14s and he's showing a four 
[01:17:30]  and you know 14s are nice oh are they no yeah because i pull a 10 every single time oh unless of  course i will pull a 10 on a 12 every time uh but the the dealer has a 12 uh there it is an 8 or a 9  and then then there's a 10 it just it is amazing to watch how often they just pull hands out that you  can't pull out and then you double down and on an 11 and you pull an ace it's just it just kept 
[01:18:00]  happening but uh yeah the guy telling me i needed tissues that's pretty because i was just whining  but whining to him but what they wanted to happen happened what they give you a birthday gift you  right you weren't thinking of going no i wasn't at all all of a sudden you get this fine birthday gift  and you go you know what i'm going to the brigada and of course they're they're hoping at that point  you go down there and just lose a shitload exactly which i did at the beginning do you think they 
[01:18:30]  really care that it was your birthday yes i'm very nice to them but do you think they really  care that it's your birthday no they want me to come down okay good at least you know that they  want me to come down there at least you know the game that you're involved with they give me the same  suite every time nice sweet same same one like same room number and everything so you feel like you're  at home we're like i feel like we're home i'm home this is fantastic and then um keith decided to put 
[01:19:00]  meat spin up on the computer the whole time even when the butlers and stuff and like people would  come in and uh meat spin what was the final count of meat spin danny i think it was up to somewhere  around 150 000 spins 150 000 spins it just it was spinning all day and all night long  much much to everybody's enjoyment just watching uh meat spin spin along and um yeah you know they 
[01:19:30]  just they they treat me very nicely over there it's uh it's nice but you're right i i probably wouldn't  have gone unless uh i'd gotten that birthday present and thought let me just go you know what we should  just go down there right now right i mean the brigada i mean it's i mean as far as lennox city  goes damn yeah they do a great job oh my god absolutely and then and then i i was um i was like  i can never just go in there and win right off the bat it's like a constant battle of having to come 
[01:20:00]  back from a deficit i can't win like i can't step in sit down at a blackjack table and just start  winning i end up in the hole all the time i think you do that on purpose because you like to have  something to fight for is that what it is no it's not it's not i would love to just be able to like go  wow look at that i won right off the bat but see that that doesn't bother you like i think when people  are real down yeah they walk away but you hang in there i have to hang in that takes balls man and 
[01:20:30]  keith keith was saying he goes you know how this always works because you'll just lose and then  in in the morning you'll just start winning when no one the casino's empty at that point  like i i keith tells you that every time that's good oh yeah that's great i was there because that's  how it works it's it's it's like that it's gonna work that way every single time well knock what it 
[01:21:00]  has well i understand because uh i was playing all night long and uh just but you do realize that too  is a coincidence oh yeah you've had a nice nice run of course where you're down and then you start  winning in the morning it's called gambling right now you know you know what's gonna happen as long  as you understand i gotta leave just going holy shit you know i got i got taken i've left uh down  but uh thank god not that often which is good i love the borgata i win every time i go there  because i'm working you were and they pay me and i i spend a little of video poker i'm not good at it 
[01:21:30]  but i tell you one time i won myself 70 dollars playing wow that made you very happy too i'm a  i'm not anthony's a whale i'm a piece of minnow shit i'm lucky they give me a room there with as  little as i gamble they give me a nice suite they really if life was fair they'd fucking they'd put  me at the tropicana in a regular room it really depends how much you gamble uh because we do go  there but you know a few times a year and man i don't get the treatment it gets not even close 
[01:22:00]  let us go shopping not even close i can't even get a fucking reservation at one of the  restaurants i gotta wait just like anyone else would wait it's april yeah and i've gambled  already so much at the borgata that i think by the end of the year i'll have a black card  yeah yeah i think i'm gonna get the black card i don't even know what a black card is that's how  sad that's how sad i am there's the red card which everyone gets when you first don't even  have a red card then there's the black they ask me every time like i don't need a card i'm just 
[01:22:30]  playing oh you need a card for what you gotta earn what you gotta earn your comp dollars comp  dollars and stuff i'd rather be on the outside looking and then there's the black card but i don't  want them dragging me in the titanium card yeah which i've only seen one other person with you have  it yes the titanium card which uh you have a titanium card yeah what does that give you oh my  god apparently everything no for what does it give you uh more comp dollars so do you pay for uh your 
[01:23:00]  meals or anything like that no oh you don't pay for anything we sat there eating surf and turf like  kings surf and turf yesterday yes giant lobster tails and filet mignon and it's just like  whoop just send your name really he doesn't pay for anything great and then they give you like  money to go shopping with well that you have to like earn yeah from gambling and stuff but i mean  you gamble so much that your card is always maxed out they just don't yeah they send a limo from 
[01:23:30]  the borgata to my house to pick me up then go back to the borgata and then borgata back to my house  jesus to just have me come down there so i sleep in the limo it's nice i wake up i go to sleep in  the limo i wake up it's like oh i'm here it's time to gamble that hotel has some vibe about it man i've  been in a lot of them and the borgata has a fucking weird it's it's like you always feel good when you're 
[01:24:00]  there oh i love being there dude i love being there i'm saying that's just like the first time  i feel i've been to a bunch of casinos and i that when i'm in that place it's it's a completely  different feeling from anywhere else i've ever been jim's completely right so happy and uh last night  it feels like it feels like vegas is jumping for absolutely it feels like you're in a vegas hotel  even though you're in yeah atlantic city and shitty fucking jersey really figured out how to get  there's all the hotels down there and i don't want to point any out because i don't want to piss anyone 
[01:24:30]  off but they're they're they're shit they haven't done anything to their years since they built them  and when you're in those hotels you realize exactly where you are yeah not in the nicest town but god  is great they had uh what was it saturday night that club opens up murmur it's called and all you see  are beautiful girls dressed in little fucking dresses that are skin tight you think it was the  pimp awards or whatever dude it it it was the largest collection of hot chicks i've seen in one

[01:27:00]  big popeye arm yeah one popeye arm very nice jesus it was great just had a good time want to say  thank you to all all the uh people down there it was great will you come when i'm there again yes  because it makes me feel important when you come i will definitely they really love it fancy man  love being down there yeah what happened to the private jet sean and georgia wants to know uh 
[01:27:30]  i don't think didn't you get on the jet one time that was for mohegan for mohegan yeah see you got  to put that out there because now you know borgata's gonna be like fuck that keith i'm getting a  fucking helicopter for mr kumia keith apparently calls up mohegan and is like yeah borgata just you  know he just gave anthony a nice computer for his birthday and went down there and that and then  mohegan's got to come to the table do you still go there yeah yeah you go up there not as much as 
[01:28:00]  borgata because it's just easier but if you know they hook me up with the jet then it's easy they  could have had you there with the jet if they didn't put eight other stops eight stops did they  have a bunch of stops in the jet from mohegan no other people no it was bad weather so we had a  circle around for a long time over the long island sound oh it was terrible really oh the plane was  bouncing around and really like horrid weather it's supposed to take 20 minutes to get from 
[01:28:30]  republic airport to the airport that's near mohegan and we were up there for well over an hour it's a  20 minute flight yeah and wait it's right across the sound they were about it was bouncing bouncing  like crazy the turns were frightening because like because we had to keep circling and circling and  every time he turned we'd bounce around so much that you'd lose altitude and feel like were people  scared uh no we were all hammered i think my mom sal was in there and um yeah was it a nice jet 
[01:29:00]  yeah it was nice you know but it was um was it like a regular was it like a corporate jet with like  yeah nice fucking cushy chairs and shit no no it was your basic basic chairs and stuff but uh the the  worst part was after we finally did land and i swear i saw fog the entire way couldn't see anything  except the that flashing light that really glows in the fog out the window like it makes the whole  outside light up oh yeah so i saw that and then finally saw runway and and we landed and then i see 
[01:29:30]  this uh this large uh african-american gentleman taking the luggage out of the plane and i'm like oh  good he puts it into the limo and the limo takes us to the hotel and he's uh taking it out and then i  realized he was the pilot what yeah he's the same guy that flies the plane who was doing the luggage  and then i'm just thinking oh my god that guy looks like you know he could be a bus driver and stuff 
[01:30:00]  landing and landing in heavy fog but you landed you were okay yeah yeah you did a good job after a  couple of attempts and uh circling around for an hour you went down and tried to come back i think  he couldn't find the airport to tell you the truth we were convinced he he lost the airport and had to  you know he lost side of it wire yeah yeah because we were circling around for a while just kind of  looking for things i think you ever been in it was pretty scary you ever been in a plane you're looking  out the window and you're assuming you're assuming you're in the middle of the clouds which i guess 
[01:30:30]  you basically are and then the next thing you see is the fucking ground is like yeah 50 60 feet  you're like right there you finally dropped out of the i thought we were still what 10 000 feet in  the air yeah yeah that's creepy that's real creepy too much airline well yeah must have thought the  must have thought it was a little clearer at a little lower altitude yeah well whoopsie did he  treat your luggage well at least he didn't throw it around right no no yeah i actually picked it up  put it right in the trunk very nicely i didn't trip on it or anything 
[01:31:00]  i think it's important i don't know american tourist or sounds like a good weekend it was  fun it was definitely a a fun uh fun little weekend down there at the borgheta i did nothing but watch  sports it was a little in the room we watched some of the uh open i watched some of the um  yankees trouncing of the rays which was good and uh you didn't watch hockey no no hockey  the nhl they got to wake the fuck up so you got the rangers and the flyers uh last game of the 
[01:31:30]  season whoever wins goes into the playoffs big huge fucking game right of course the game ends in a tie  so they have to go to a shootout to decide who goes into the playoffs that's just all that's horse  shit comes down to a coin toss i understand regular season you know you do that i i i still think they  should have a 10 minute overtime whatever i i'm not a big fan of the shootout as much as i was at first  to have it come down to a shootout to see who goes into the playoffs is so dumb the nhl should have 
[01:32:00]  stepped in i don't even know if they could have and said look okay if this game is going to decide  the whole thing we got to play a long overtime here to decide this who went uh the flyers beat  the rangers in a shootout you know i'm not a rangers fan but i feel kind of bad for rangers fans  because it just doesn't seem fair that it came down to a shootout after that great hockey game  yesterday yes you know i have a i have i have a big day tomorrow is that really going down hell

[01:37:30]  don't know this penthouse pet of the year yeah yeah in the latest penthouse we should give her a  little plug taylor vixen it's taylor vixen on uh twitter i figure how many times am i going to get  to actually uh go on a date with uh the penthouse pet of the year i can answer that once once exactly  that's what i figured you know lydia's on the line let's do that oh and you know what i agree  with lydia wow and i i hate to say that today but i agree with you lydia go ahead what did she say 
[01:38:00]  they're gonna find anthony dead in hotel room with fucking brazilian meat on his face his wallet  are you are you're secretly hoping this is some kind of elaborate setup that would be hilarious  but i hope that she's i hope she's a member of a new website called get your date raped by blacks.com  yeah and they just fuck anthony's butthole really hard while he's vomiting 
[01:38:30]  brazilian food into the tub not even into the toilet it's no no i hope they  fucking handcuff him to the fucking the tub somehow and he fuck his butt really hard  he's fucking he's vomiting half-eaten rice  lots of bourbon he's trying to he's trying to  shit out meat they're pushing it back in  hey lydia go ahead  lydia i think uh i think you should rethink the brazilian  barbecue for a penthouse pet of the year it's you know not 
[01:39:00]  you're wrong yeah why why are you picking the brazilian place because i agree with lydia  actually because she there's a lot of great state places that suggested it all right she wants to go  there this place is tremendous it was it was it has one of the cleanest ratings for any restaurant  in new york the only problem is you go there to eat a lot yes so if you're on a first date  if you're on a first date you there's many other places you could go it's a great restaurant  because you can get up you go get your own stuff it's not a fucking the salad bar alone is unbelievable 
[01:39:30]  you don't even need the meat after the salad bar what they give you up there that's one of my  favorite it has everything the salad bar has everything you could imagine yeah and then you  sit down and start ordering well they bring the meat until you say no yeah lydia if you've never  been there this place is for not it's a great restaurant but everyone off the street is there you  should really take her to that beautiful restaurant i don't want to say the name right where you work  no they're not all off there they're not all off del frisco's downstairs this is better than 
[01:40:00]  del frisco's del frisco's she wants brazilian food this is a better place lydia why am i going to take  her to a place she doesn't want to go no that's a great first you're 100 right i i didn't know she  wanted to go there you're 100 right i would have chosen this place okay i i just think del frisco's  is a great impression adrian's on the top of the peninsula when did you ever make a great  impression lydia and fuck uh del frisco's is good but it went a bunch of guys with ties it's a bunch  of these wall street boars yeah stop it that's true that's true i just want to have a great time 
[01:40:30]  i just want to be seen with a penthouse pet of the year would you stop exactly where the fuck we eat  all right lydia bye i love this restaurant man i sure i want to see the picture that uh  uh danny had up there before that's where i want to eat and the best the best service at any  restaurant was in the restaurant at the y you want to eat that at the y all right very good so the  date's on and we were all wondering so you and taylor vixen from penthouse game on going out uh going

[01:41:30]  was screaming at them yeah yeah never a good sign i wish we had audio excuse my this chair is too loud  by the way a lot of you guys complain this fucking judge was screaming at every defendant  calling the one guy called a lump he was just hollering but he sounded crazier than fucking  hitler yeah yeah he was a really a hardcore nazi see if you can find the the valkyrie trials whatever  there's got to be an idea of this judge gall of them to try to kill hitler oh but he was screaming at 
[01:42:00]  them really it was not fair no it wasn't fair and the guys did you see the picture of the guys just  kind of standing there with their heads down like all right can we just get this over with and have me  shot yeah i mean he's just trying to sell let's see if they have any of this guy yelling  the nazi leadership acts of individual conscience at war with an overpowering  national consensus let's fast forward to wait you try it louder there's problems this guy's trying to 
[01:42:30]  plead his case talking about how um he had some hard times yes  the judge 
[01:43:00]  you're really a filthy louse the judge says  are you cracking up he's asking  he's giving me a boner  this judge i watched a whole bunch of him every one he would scream at that you are a louse you're 
[01:43:30]  a louse a lump he was this judge was funny this was no wapner then they were just taken out and  shot like instantly no they hung them they a lot of the guys but they hung them with a very very  thin wire and so it would be a slower death oh yeah they didn't play games with these guys they  hung over 200 people they killed 700 were put on trial 200 were executed and there was one general  who was convicted of cowardice who was just shot which was like a break to get right and that hung

[01:50:30]  that's a nightmare like i said earlier they're picking the skull off of what is that a pig or a goat i can't  even tell look at all the shit they just took off of that head jesus what do they do they just  fucking salt it all right this guy knows how to make head cheese uh brad in mississippi brad  dude we grew up on a dairy farm down here in mississippi and uh we make it uh we used to make  it i'm older now and i don't live there anymore but we used to make it once you cut the once you 
[01:51:00]  slaughter the the pig you cut their head off and i guess y'all are watching a video of it now but then you  you remove the brain because you want to scramble that in your eggs you remove the tongue because  you can cut that up and put that as a meat in a salad a lot of a lot of old folks do that wait  people scramble the brains in the eggs yes yes dude it makes the it makes the eggs  a little more greasy i guess is the way you would put it 
[01:51:30]  get the fuck out of here i swear man all right erock's gotta eat scrambled eggs with  his fucking uh pig brains it's really i mean i'll try that would be almost cannibalistic  because he's stupid and a pig yes let's get some head cheese immediately can we have  moody dumbbells go by head i'm getting the tv jv's watching these videos dude this guy talking about how  people take the tongue and put it in salad and chop it up it's called uh you just chop it up like you 
[01:52:00]  would chop up ham diced up ham or something to put in your salad and then you take out the uh  i don't know the i'm sure there's a technical name for it but the the part of the ear that makes the  wax you dig down in the ear and you hollow they basically hollow the ear out and you take out the  gland of the organ that makes the wax for the ear because that'll make the head cheese bitter  um and you take that out and throw that away throw the throw the wax making oh thank god thank god  someone said you know what we don't have to eat everything yeah they actually throw something 
[01:52:30]  away this will make it taste bad pig wax gland isn't a delicacy right when i was a little i remember  looking over in a huge like a number three wash tub a big wash tub and seeing about four hog heads  being boiled and the head just kind of bobbing in the in the water where that you boil it in and then  you take that once the head's boiled you take it out and then you pick off every you pick it down to the  skull and then and actually y'all aren't going to believe me but it's really good it's hot it's 
[01:53:00]  really really spicy hot eat it with rich crackers it's good stuff head cheese yes all right we're  we're in search of head cheese right now they're showing the carnegie deli too you should try there  they probably have it there what's the jelly stuff that holds it all together yeah the fat of the head  oh jesus that's the fat fat of the head oh my let's put it together with head who thought this  shit up let's use it doesn't it just make you angry yes this makes me mad monday's thought this 
[01:53:30]  shit up yeah all right well we're gonna we're gonna get some head cheese and have uh iraq try it  look if i could get it if i could ship it up to you i would i've got probably five pounds in my freezer  yeah we live in manhattan we can find some head cheese yeah thank you all right let's go to mongo  the trucker mongo you guys ever heard of hoggis or what goes in hoggis no no hoggis not a few paul 
[01:54:00]  i i it's it's a scottish dish i have it like once a year it's they grind up the heart lungs liver and  kidneys of a sheep and they stuff it into the stomach with uh oatmeal and spices and then you bake it  how it sounds great it's actually not bad yes it is see you should never eat something that's not  bad there's plenty of shit to eat out there why would you why would you add a not bad thing to your  diet yeah well it's a it's a traditional i mean it's a scottish dish and you know i'm scottish so 
[01:54:30]  well scottish heritage so it's kind of a you know i don't know so you get drunk and have a lot of scotch  and then it goes down easier i don't know man i i don't get it i don't get it is that a blood  sausage we're just now watching fucking food being made what is that watching how they squeeze  it into a sleeve it's modern marvels this is the history of cold cuts and they're making head cheese  and that is just like salami too right yeah yeah well this episode was all about cold cuts but this 
[01:55:00]  particular part is about the head cheese it's amazing like they hold the fucking like the the  casing around a little uh two looks like an ice cream dispenser and all of this meat comes through  and it just stretches the casey out into a yeah big yeah big fucking all right mongo thank you  yeah that's gonna wait in virginia it's like a bunch of giant maggots  wow hey guys hey wait big fan thank you i wanted to tell you that there's a uh when i was growing up 
[01:55:30]  and it's the restaurant's still there i don't know if it still serves it but they had brains and eggs  on the menu would you eat brains and eggs ever in no how about without the brains no oh yes i never  had the guts to order it i was like 12 and i was like no way that can't possibly be good look at that  what is that head cheese cheese how fucking disgusting here we go liverwurst we have an eta on our head  cheese do they run out all right they're trying to find head cheese right now and he rocks gonna 
[01:56:00]  eat it hell yeah i say he wears it on his head like earmuffs two big slabs of head cheese held by animal  fat i want to slather his body maybe we should ask eric if he's had it before because he might be a ringer  you know what he probably loves it that's true yeah it's stupid hey eric here he comes  just one of the alternative meats guys eric yeah you ever have head cheese no what's the worst thing 
[01:56:30]  you ever ate oh geez uh i don't know kidneys liver who about scrapple you ever eat scrapple  scrapple's not bad i've had it depends who makes it scrapple is awful but like in pennsylvania it's  really popular yeah it is down in the field some places make it really really good i've got my  picture beside the manufacturing plant where they make that out in delaware you know what head cheese  is uh era yeah there's it also depends who makes it because like boar's head makes the head cheese but 
[01:57:00]  it's in a gelatin it's not made like what the video yeah but the the real old school like the  we want old school head cheese i want someone to go down to chinatown and get some head cheese  because you know they they're doing some shit to it or the carnegie the carnegie will have real  head cheese yeah the carnegie will be too easy though i think they'll probably have a nice version  of head cheese i think eric's forgetting about the boiled meat barbecue that took place on this  show a few years back well no because that's worse than that that boiled tripe was probably the 
[01:57:30]  worst thing i ever had in my mouth that was disgusting actually the gooey duck  uh we had a great idea until the stupid lawyers forced us to boil everything which made  in that case it made the bit better because we were so pissed at the lawyers but then we're like  you know what boiled tripe this can't taste good you remember our program director at the time said  the way to make the bit better is like when just to make like have animal noises like like while we're 
[01:58:00]  doing this to have pig sounds oh yeah he actually said that no she did i'm not gonna say i don't  even know and also pig noises and like while that was happening you should have been playing like  cow noises like we had a few meetings about about animal sounds sound effects yeah they wanted more  like sounds she wanted pig noises we should have just played her voicemails oh wow  she was the worst i wanted to fuck her though did you yeah 
[01:58:30]  she turned me on really no yeah she did the witch hair skaggy i thought she was sexy  she got really mad at you because you made that comment about her being a witch that she  turned to dust and then rats ran out of the room did i say that yeah she talked about that for  weeks how she hated you what a great line what a great god about that one yeah i didn't remember  saying that to her she collapses into dust and then rats would run out of the room

[02:00:00]  chitlins cow and pig intestines english have the worst fucking food yeah  it's one of the colonizing the entire world they're trying to find something palatable  something tasty besides just pig fucking innards let's go to leslie in philly  leslie's fights are terrible today they smell like head cheese is shitting  hey how you doing guys i just wanted to let you know when i was a little girl i kind of lived in  the suburbs of philly and uh grandmom used to buy a half a pig every year around christmas and after  the loin was gone and the chops and all that good stuff it was scrapple time which was basically 
[02:00:30]  you know every part that you would never want to eat and she was always especially happy when  there was still some corn undigested left in the uh intestines so they went right in the  scrapple and you know what is wrong with you people oh god madam do you like shoe fly pie as well  yes what is that it is really sweet what is it it's got like molasses  molasses and sugar and basically fat let's talk about so you would eat pig shit yeah let's talk 
[02:01:00]  about uh molasses for a second worst spice ever you know like molasses sucks a dick i don't think  i've ever had the need to use molasses for anything there's a few pussies i wanted to throw a little  molasses on or truck tire rubber anything that would remove the odor pardon me madam would you  mind if i drip a little molasses on this fucking this wound you call a vagina anything that would  remove the guilt it gets infected yeah yes all right leslie thank you for that bye yeah we know 
[02:01:30]  ah striker we've done ah whatever it's been a while go ahead striker explain rocky mountain oysters  oh rocky mountain oysters what a delicacy bowl and sheep testicles that's disgusting what you know  good things yeah that sounds great is it good though can't be i like eating red velvet cake  didn't we have me someone said that someone said they couldn't wait that every supermarket has pig

[02:02:30]  for hours and have sat around and talk to for hours thank you kevin smith i gotta tell you something  about uh kevin smith he was doing one of his uh what does he call him like a q and a's q and a's  or a live smodcast well not whatever i mean he goes out and has the gift of gab so he just uh  he did one in phoenix over the weekend and our name our names came up and he gave us  like just huge props during his show very nice and it got back to us so i want to thank 
[02:03:00]  that kevin smith on twitter for doing that to us uh for us that was very very nice sir very very nice  of you and i look forward to another car and geese hall show from kevin smith when is that going to  happen i think he was hinted maybe in the fall yeah he does those all over and they just pack out  absolutely ufc 112 i gotta i gotta be honest i didn't see this fucking thing because i was  confused i didn't know when to watch it and jimmy was tweeting about it and uh and there was there 
[02:03:30]  was a lot of controversy that came out let me apologize if i blew any results because during i  saw it in the afternoon it was from abu dhabi i watched it in the afternoon i did not twitter results  in the afternoon because i didn't want to ruin it yeah later that night i had gotten a few tweet  responses like around 11 o'clock on saturday so i assumed it was done everybody had seen it like  the the night version of it oops so a few people were pissed at me but i'm sorry that wasn't on  purpose and it was a weird um event uh well dana white is furious we can't get him on the phone he's 
[02:04:00]  so pissed he's very very angry i don't know if he is rogan is such a great announcer well let's start  the well is rogan up um might be a little early yeah it's a little early in denver someone tweet  rogan see if he's up the main fights were um there was three main fights you know i mean there's  two main events or co-main events i think and there was uh there's a henzo i think his name is  henzo it's rem but i think you say it henzo gracie and matt hughes and hughes technically  knocked him out i thought henzo gracie looked terrible um frankie edgar beat bj pin uh and won 
[02:04:30]  the belt in a unanimous decision and we got bj uh tomorrow by wednesday well i'm sorry wednesday  i don't think bj pin looked very good either it was really weird like nobody was wrestling they were  all just kind of standing up and boxing none of these jujitsu i don't know maybe because it was  so hot they were afraid to be slippery maybe because the flight was 40 hours maybe they're  just flat out exhausted i think they were probably there before they said pen was like for a week  i'm just going for a little dumb joke jimmy jesus i wasn't going for accuracy well i thought they  might be just i'm like was it travel was it maybe they were dehydrated from from being in the desert 
[02:05:00]  it's been sleepy a little sleepy so what pj uh bj uh bj penden lost i thought he should  have lost too mars didn't agree but i thought he should have lost i thought ours i think said uh  bj penn got robbed no he didn't can i can i uh see that day and then the story of the night is  is anderson silva who is probably the best fighter in mma i mean the guy is is  fucking amazing i saw him in philly he's amazing unbelievable he's an amazing fighter 
[02:05:30]  and he was uh he was fighting uh he's the middleweight champion he was fighting against uh uh  uh damian maya who they say is the best uh jiu-jitsu uh fighter in all of uh mixed martial  arts and he was really weird man anderson silva like came out and just kind of was  rogan said it best he said he was clowning him and i've never seen a fighter do this to another  fighter just watch some of the stuff he was doing it was like it wasn't just like normal shucking and 
[02:06:00]  jiving like roy jones jr does or fucking just you know to psych your opponent out it's like you were  actually scared for this guy he was treating him with such a lack of respect his hands are down to  the side his hands are down to the side he's just standing there in front of him at one point silva  was hitting the mat like come on you know he is just uh it was a really fucking weird fight the  way he would he would pepper the guy with punches he could hit the guy at will wherever he wanted to  he was kicking him and uh he actually at one point punched uh uh damian maya in the thigh the upper 
[02:06:30]  thigh just because he could like he just jumped in and punched the top of his thigh  maya was terrified of him he was fucking terrified of him and dana white was apparently very angry with  his uh performance with uh silva's performance he was like just it was really weird like silva would  like would show a flare a burst for a second and throw a few kicks and punch so you knew he could  knock this guy out at will and then he would just stop and do nothing he wanted to walk around the  ring dude walked last two rounds he hardly threw any punches he was just kind of dancing and making 
[02:07:00]  faces and shaking his ass at the guy it was really shaking his ass so dana white was pissed that he  didn't finish him off god he was pissed that like this is championship fighting and people paying to  watch this yeah and again for one round you want to make a point like ali punished floyd patterson i think  uh he for for not saying his name or i don't know if that was the one he punished but ali had done  stuff like this and this guy idolized ali but ali didn't do it without fucking i don't know ali 
[02:07:30]  didn't do it like with this complete lack of motivation this guy said that damien like  disrespected his jujitsu somehow with ali it was over like the guy not saying his name it was over  like a religious shit did this just seem like he wanted to show off and just humiliate this guy  right well we got dana white at the press conference so let's check this out i forgot to  tell everyone bill burr is going to be calling in a few minutes as well today so dana was embarrassed by  silva's fight wants to make it up to ufc fans so while they're getting these guys in believe me  i'll answer the questions of what a disgrace the uh the main event was and what an embarrassment it is 
[02:08:00]  i don't think i've ever been more embarrassed in the 10 years of being in this business and first time  that i've ever walked out on a main event and given the belt to the guy's manager and told him to put it  on him um what i don't want to do is take away from the guys who did fight great fights tonight  i think frankie edgar fought a great fight tonight and uh you know implemented a game plan and stuck to 
[02:08:30]  it obviously you know the demarcus johnson fight he won that was a war uh this kid turned around  uh was losing the fight and and pulls it off and wins a lot of great fights tonight so i don't want to  uh be as miserable as i am right now and and not focus on all the guys who really performed tonight  and did a great job um but this was a historic event for us the arena tonight was incredible the  energy was amazing and to end it the way that we did is an embarrassment uh you know for me the vertidas 
[02:09:00]  the ufc and uh you know the sport in general so i apologize and i will i don't know how yet but i will  make this up to the fans that bought this tonight go back to the beginning day we're just we're just  watching this because the first couple rounds where he really did this is round four how do you not love  dana like this guy what an honest dude he is to come out and just say it was an embarrassment he  called him a jackass yeah yeah i mean uh how do you not love the fact that he's so fucking brutally  honest he didn't he didn't he doesn't soft soap shit well let's go to joe in arizona joe what's going 
[02:09:30]  on guys what do you say joe man what in the hell is going on here i will never order another fight  again now you shouldn't honestly dude and i'm not i'm not just a fan of the ufc because i like it  the reason i thought it was good to watch is because you really are watching the best fighter in mma  uh i to me it was an interesting fight to watch but don't let that throw you this is a very it's a  really rare thing that this happens um most of these guys are fucking not what is silver saying i don't 
[02:10:00]  i still don't get what happened he's unapologetic he apologized in the ring but afterwards he said  the guy disrespected him and his job was to punish him and he did and right now he's just throwing  his face he's holding his fist out let the other guy come in and then he's just hitting the guy at  will he's showing the guy no no respect if you watch every anderson civil fight there is he has  a track record of doing this he likes to jockey around he likes to play you know and then after every  fight he likes to say oh i'm sorry i didn't finish it you know honestly if he sticks his head out like 
[02:10:30]  that he's talking about moving up you know weight class to fight dorsey and pierre or whatever  if he does that he sticks his chin out dorsey and pierre's gonna rock his ass well the point i i think  one of there's a reason like when he's clowning like this in the first round and he's made he's  mugging and he's kind of just throwing kicks and punches and showing the guy no respect to me  there's a psychological angle to that which makes sense because that really is scary to watch dude  like you're watching a guy who is absolutely so silver was way better and he's by he could have  knocked him out in the first round and everyone thought that he should just finish this fight 
[02:11:00]  yeah naturally instead of fucked around like he's dragging him along watch the kick he throws at  this guy's midsection the spin kick it's fucking devastating he could have he could have knocked  this guy out in less than two minutes if he wanted to no you got a good point though but honestly yeah  he is a great fighter but honestly if he does that against anybody else i mean yeah you say  psychological but to me personally i mean i'm not no tough guy or badass or anything but if he did that  to you personally i don't care if i get knocked out i'm gonna swing for that chin if he keeps sticking out at me like  that you know me shaking his ass take a minute yeah let me uh let me put footer on with you joe uh 
[02:11:30]  footer you're talking to joe in arizona yo what's up guys hey two things real real quick first of all  you know you said that you're not going to order a fight again the way dana handled it is exactly why  you should be ordering a fight again and and let me make the point as far as dana's so pissed  because he's trying to build his reputation as not these fucking bunch of animals in the ring  just beating the shitties out of each other he wants to try to you know promote the professionalism  and and you understand what i'm saying you should be ordering another fight because dana came out 
[02:12:00]  and acknowledged that's not what this is about you kind of get what i'm saying yeah i understand what  you're saying no i do i do i think what i think what dana's gonna end up oh sorry i think you do  order the fight for professionalism you are right but you know that is not professionalism yes he is a  great fighter yes he is very very skilled at what he does but the same aspect i mean you you don't  just respect your opponent i mean yeah granted now was it a mistake dana white in the ufc to put a  guy you know i mean like him against a guy like silva i believe so but then again there's so less 
[02:12:30]  people that are not willing to fight silva you know he's probably the first guy said oh what the hell  i'll do it you know i just think maybe better matchmaking and i think it is time for silva to  either move up a class or fight somebody that's a little bit more worthwhile you know i mean i think  this is part of silva's game plan too because it really is when you're fighting a guy who you  think has no respect for you and who is that who feels he's that much better and silva can fight  i mean the guy is he's good with his fucking hands a great kickboxer he's a deadly guy to me there's  a real psychological effect to that but after like the first or in the middle of the second round 
[02:13:00]  you're like what is he doing right now he's like fucking around to the point where he's not just  trying to to kill this guy and beat the shit out of him to win the fight he's like doing something  that goes beyond that and it didn't make sense after a while right on yes do you think  now you're right i'll retract my previous team i will order another fight but i tell you what i'm  really looking forward to that brock lesnar and corwin fight qualify i know what so what you're  asking me i think what there's gonna be a war and i want corwin to win so bad all right so you're 
[02:13:30]  gonna be ordering another fight it's obvious and the guy's laying on his back we gotta let you go  my is on his back like kind of hoping that i think that he wanted silva in a in a in a in a  in a jiu-jitsu yeah he wanted some ground action he was just kicking him on the ground kicking his hand  what are you gonna ask me sir uh he's gone foot out hey hey real quick i want to ask him do you  think that's the reason why i mean uh dana is so pissed is because i mean like as far as just you  know he works so hard to get the stuff to new york i mean just all these different things he's  trying to build this rep and then you know even when um fucking lesnar talk this shit like did a 
[02:14:00]  little bit of that that wwf stick i think those type of things dana just fucking really loses it  because he's like does that make sense absolutely he wants a legitimate sport dude he wants it to be a  legitimate sport but i i've talked to dana about it too i i like a little of that trash talking just  a little because i don't i don't i like thinking that some of these guys hate each other uh before  they go into the into the fight the human aspect of it as far as like just the shit talking and stuff  like that yes 100 yeah i think rogan brought it up uh when he was on to you guys you can't oh no 
[02:14:30]  you can't bitch somebody out if that guy is getting once he gets into that ring with you  right you can't bitch him out he's ran enough to get into the fucking ring with you you fight  him like a man if you whoop his ass quick you whoop his ass quick but either way that guy stepped  in the ring before he stepped in the ring anything goes i mean you know you know what i mean here's  the thing here's here's what i think dana is crazy about i don't think dana mind shit talking because  chuck shit talks tito all the time he hates him i think what he doesn't like as things that go way 
[02:15:00]  beyond being a sports because this this is not wwe these guys are fucking martial artists man this  it's a different fucking art and it's like when you see a guy trashing the sponsor like like brock  did that's bad business and motherfucking a guy like frank mere after he really hurt him it's like  it just makes the sport look like childish and and dumb it doesn't make it like even after  fucking so fights like with ollie would hate people and this now he didn't motherfuck them in the ring  and humiliate them that way you don't do it gotcha all right footer well a couple other things too 
[02:15:30]  this is the first time what ufc was in the middle east abu dabi yeah so i'm sure dana  white wanted to have a fine fucking show for the first time right they built this arena for this  event in three weeks bobby kelly me and bobby watched together he said they built this in three weeks  for the event there's all sheiks there there's a lot of money there right so they want to make  sure they put on a great display a good show because so so so they're invited back so it's just awesome  though man some investors um oh really yeah some uh abu dabi investors are buying into it so so 
[02:16:00]  silva's got his hands up like in the 1920s boxing pose yeah just to mock this guy and he's just  jumping back and hitting the guy at will and that's if he has his hands up at all yeah look  now he's just standing with his arms at his sides and he's got like his one right arm up and he's  put his left arm up just just kind of like daring the guy to take a swing at him he's really really  embarrassing him well we got our conspiracy theory from mike in albany mike it's not really much of a  conspiracy theory danison said it many times he doesn't care about being a champion he just wants to 
[02:16:30]  fight the best people and he wants he said many times he wants to move up to heavyweight to fight  frank mir he says he wants to move down to welterweight to fight george saint pierre but  dana won't let him won't make those fights for him this is kind of his way of saying fuck you  well that's what i'm saying that's the conspiracy part of it that's what you're you're you're thinking  is happening well you might be right uh is that true that dana won't let him move up i didn't know  dana wouldn't let him move up i i know that saint pierre was there and that was i think what  does saint pierre fight at 170 he's gone oh okay all right um i know he has to go down and wait to 
[02:17:00]  fight saint pierre and saint pierre was there and people are just chanting gsp because they want to  see this fight i think silver would would would absolutely beat saint pierre too though all right  we got two more clips from dana white but first we got bill burr on the line hey bill what's going  on guys what's up you're at the masters yeah i'm actually at the airport right now oh yeah for the  the masters uh yesterday without a doubt the most uh snootiest thing i've been to 
[02:17:30]  other than maybe the u.s open tennis thing yes snooty what makes it snootier than the u.s open  tennis thing well it's like a private golf course and you don't get tickets to it you actually you get  these badges that yeah that members aren't supposed to sell but they sell them yeah show up you have to  have a college shirt you can't have jeans on if you yell out at the golfers it's like 900 rules  and if you break any of them like some secret service guy come crawls out of a tree snatches 
[02:18:00]  your badge tosses you out you got to pay like a five thousand dollar fine or something for losing your  badge wow you're kind of sitting there and meanwhile they like they're serving beer and they don't even  let you know when the beer comes on and they won't tell you what kind of beer it is because they  they don't want any advertising it was all just kind of just sit down and shut up and uh drink what  we give you wow yeah you're not quite going to a hockey game or you know now i drank like i was at  a hockey game but who'd you follow uh you know what i've after a while it just you can't see anything 
[02:18:30]  so i just went over to the 15th hole we just sat down and we just waited a couple hours and just let  everybody pass through but it's funny man they make it seem like it's real snooty but it's kind of a bunch  of drunks sitting there we actually were betting on the turtle sitting outside the uh the pond  there which one was going to go in that's basically how bored you are until they come  through but i gotta admit dude it's pretty awesome though when tiger comes over the hill  he's got the red shirt on and uh dude it's like a temptation to just yell something just to 
[02:19:00]  get kicked out it's unbelievable see that's why we haven't really seen what the what the fans are  going to do with tiger because because because of what bill's saying i mean they're really strict  down there a regular golf tournament you're going to hear people yelling some shit at tiger  oh no like i gotta tell you the the you would just be instantly you'd be right up there with fan man  if you ever like it was like you could literally have run down the bleachers jumped in the air and  did a cannonball right into this little uh whatever they call it a little moat like around the uh the 
[02:19:30]  green or something if you did that when like on phil mickelson's approach shot you would be like  like it'd be like 200 million hits on youtube yeah no shit right you should have went for it bill  you know bill makes i was actually sitting there and i was thinking about your show and i was  trying to think who on the show would do it for some reason the first person i thought of was danny  yeah yeah yeah probably danny would be first accidentally maybe in a drunken stupid 
[02:20:00]  people don't realize you go to these golf tournaments you can't see shit and what you have  to do is you have to go you have to camp out many many holes ahead if you're that lucky and sit  there for three hours to maybe see tiger's group go through and you see tiger well what do you see  tiger hit maybe two shots uh i saw his approaching shot i i saw his uh him put it in and then like we 
[02:20:30]  could actually see 16 you couldn't see him drive we just saw it land so i thought i thought two holes  in one on 16 sitting on 15 but i only saw the ball land and i would hear the crowd start to go crazy  and just watch it roll in yeah so uh yeah it's kind of like when i went to the indy 500 you just sit  there and a bunch of cars dip by you it just all becomes drinking and gambling yeah because you you  can't really follow what's going on whatsoever you i mean they make it look on tv like oh wow you  can just kind of follow tiger around these people are enjoying tiger playing no those people have 
[02:21:00]  been sitting there for three hours just to see him hit one or two shots and that's it then you gotta  wait for the next guys to come through and they're hammered too and you don't really know what shot  they're on like somebody just came up to me they saw i had this masters uh green bag thing here and  the guy's like going oh you sat on 15 so you saw kim eagle that hole right yeah i was like no i was  there yesterday he goes no no he eagled that hole and i was like oh yeah i saw that  no idea it was still a good time though man it was definitely a good time and there was some uh 
[02:21:30]  really really really like super white people to the point that i i mean that place was so white  like i felt like the help and i look like howdy doody you're pretty white though bill they're they  were a lot wider than you huh that's what i'm saying i'm pretty crazy yeah but but i didn't have like  those uh yeah i can't explain that you know that that that the pink polo shirt tacky short date  rapist look that those guys have yeah yeah they had like that going on like they they could actually 
[02:22:00]  get out of some shit if they did something illegal unbelievable did you see um uh phil mickelson on uh  on two the video's all over the place something dropped onto the green yeah he was oh yeah i heard  about like a little little nugget i didn't see anything yeah i don't know what the 15 getting  sunburned drinking beer that i had no idea what kind it was i think it was coarse life  it proves that you know marketing really works you don't even know what beer you were drinking you 
[02:22:30]  can't even figure it out no not at all because because there's no label on it standing in an airport  level of funny right now it's all out there just for the uh open no no i did uh i was  doing the punchline in atlanta so how'd you get you know the usual usual way i do the road i'm so  sick of going to all these cities so there has to be something cool for me to do this something going  on right yeah a gun show i'll go to anything other than sitting in a double tree again but i'm jealous 
[02:23:00]  how'd you get into the masters you just knew somebody obviously somebody from the club i thought  it was going to be easy i thought it was like getting tickets i didn't know that whole rule about the  badges like we literally drove to somebody's house it sat in their garage they had like a breakfast  buffet out because they were selling all their badges and it was we i don't know like we felt  like we were going the wrong way but um somebody from the club made basically i think about 38 calls  to every radio station and something and they found somebody but the thing is now i have that number i 
[02:23:30]  have the hookup so if i want to go again you know next year i can call them up but i don't know i think  that might have been a one-time thing it's much better to watch it on tv how much did it cost yeah  i gotta ask that yeah it was like uh it was 600 um for the badges which actually wasn't bad because  we got him in february before tiger said that he was going to play but we knew he was going to play  there was no way he could sit in that house with that awkwardness any longer yeah just watching at  home with his wife standing over him yeah he's the king and he's walking around his own house with

[02:29:00]  the robots yeah but yeah you're watching fucking girls eating shit right they're like that person be  replaced by a robot you are so fucking gone no seriously man i went i went to the dentist the  other day and they had a national geographic magazine so i go all right let me try to get  smart let me take a look at this magazine cover to cover it basically said we're all going to die  we're running out of water and there's going to be riots in the streets i can't wait so uh so as much 
[02:29:30]  as we make fun of anthony i think he's pretty prepared yeah you gotta be prepared he already has the  arsenal well we got the dentist getting the sensor taken out of your tooth getting a tracking device  taken out of your tooth yeah seriously i needed my first cavity of my life you see what happened just  there bill burr just you see what just happened right there bill burr just announced to the the  world that we're all going to die because we're running out of water yeah and ant's first reaction  which it should have been the proper reaction was to make fun of bill burr being at the dentist 
[02:30:00]  yeah like not even acknowledging the fact that bill burr just gave us all the knowledge we need  that we're all going to die because we're running out of water i mean the info is out there it's out  there in a magazine right now and no one's paying attention to it yeah i really hope that i'm tracking  internet but national geographic it's not really out there if you put it in us magazine it would be  there would be like widespread panic but you stick it in a magazine like that no one's gonna know  well they're too busy putting the latest shots of kim kardashian in us yeah i mean i like i 
[02:30:30]  i wouldn't have known it if i wasn't you know yeah they had a dumber magazine there i would have  read it but they didn't you know when oh my god like i like that one too when you go to a doctor's  office or a dentist's office you do pick up the dumbest magazine they have to offer yeah oh what's  happening they could have a newsweek or something there but they got some shitty people magazine you're  you're gonna go people magazine before newsweek every time every time like dumb we are because of  like you know gps and spell check you don't even have to think anymore yeah i took the guy middle 
[02:31:00]  in for me this week paul verzi hilarious guy right we go to the waffle house and he had never been  there before and i've been there so the waitress comes up and says you guys ready to order and i  knew the menu so i'm like yeah i'm ready to order so i start ordering this idiot goes into a panic  because it's one of those overwhelming menus where there's like 58 pictures of the different kinds of  toast you can get so he didn't really look at what they had he already ordered at a waffle house  he ordered eggs benedict 
[02:31:30]  i thought that lady was i thought her brain was going to explode she was like a what  that's classy  over easy to scramble jackass  yeah dummy  i don't know you know that might have been a regional joke you guys don't have the waffle  houses we all know about we know we know uh patrice was in here because i asked you about conspiracy  theories because he's on to this uh this water thing what the fuck was the water thing everyone  everyone tweeted us after patrice and said you got to get bill burr's take on the water thing what 
[02:32:00]  was it water purifier what was it though it's a whole new water purifier zero  yeah i brought up and everybody just told me i was gonna buy a 1200 humidifier  it was it was basically it was this device that could pull like seven gallons of water out of the  air right every day up to seven gallons and then it would filter it to make it a decent drinking  water right for some reason a listener called up and told me that that was a humidifier everybody  laughed at me i felt embarrassed and i never bought one and that's all it takes 
[02:32:30]  i took that one ona listener i was all right he knows everything right moron  uh patrice is just talking about like a brita water filter that that filters out all the uh  solid impurities in but it was a new one yeah it's called water zero or something it was called  what was it something zero i think you need you're going to need to have guns like anthony  because if you think everybody in your block is going to be walking around parched and you're  going to be sitting there drinking a mint julep on your front porch and no one's going to come 
[02:33:00]  after you with like a backhoe or something you're crazy it's just going to be it's going to turn  into i will kill you to get what i want uh for me and my family so yeah yeah basically what you're  doing is you're buying a water purifier for the toughest guy in your block  uh it was thank you danny it was called zero water you might want to look up the zero water  thing no you know what dude i've tapped out i can't because i'm going to look that up and there's 
[02:33:30]  going to be a page and a half of stuff scaring the shit out of me and then i'm going to walk around  trying to tell it to other people with this panicked look on my face and alienate myself  even more so i've just resigned myself to the fact that i can only die once yeah so you know  i'm going to go to the masters i'm going to get drunk off a beer you know you don't want to tell  me what it is i'm fine yeah microchip and i don't care anymore when when do you think it's going to go  down when do you think we're finally going to just go into anarchy according to hollywood in 2012

[02:34:30]  enough water it's just you know all these idiots going into a cheesecake factory just lock the door  turn on the gas and uh they'll be you know what you joke but the biggest mistake this planet's doing  is trying to save everybody it's the dumbest well you know what and it's not even because they give  a shit it's because you can make so much goddamn money the more people you have walking around  old people like die and or start to die they start the dying process and then they they just bring

[02:36:30]  internet which is you know looking at goofy here or is it just home use i would i would look like an  ocd freak because i just yeah go to the same shit over and over really over and over again i i i'm a  degenerate on the internet i like looking at um uh pornography um but then again i will uh look  up a lot of science stuff they would be confused by you yeah yeah they really would be confused by  you there's no real pattern like i could run the robots but i'd probably try to figure out how they 
[02:37:00]  could i could get them to uh blow me uh yes uh jimmy if they took anthony's computer they would think  that roman polanski and hitler were roommates sharing sharing a computer  nice that guy that uh swimming coach that oh god that swimming coach that got nailed um  for apparently 30 swimming coaches over the past 10 years for the uh you know the training for the 
[02:37:30]  olympics and stuff uh have been caught for inappropriate sexual behavior with their swimmers  hard not to yeah oh tell me about it please ever see a swimmer's body what's wrong swimmers  build is lovely yeah this one guy uh he had a special like shower locker room thing that only  certain girls went into and uh these had lockers that he had put a camera in one of the lockers  and he would record them undressing and showering stuff like that how the 
[02:38:00]  fuck did he get caught let me tell you how he got caught okay because there's something stupid  there's another brilliant uh uh guy um he decided to sell his computer on ebay all right now how much  can you get for a used computer on ebay sure so he sells it and a woman buys it she's going through  it and finds a video and clicks on it and it seems to be a hidden camera of a girl getting naked in a  locker room i wish i bought that to the cops yeah and then they went to his house and found a 
[02:38:30]  uh um jackpot of uh videos and pictures and stuff that got him in a lot of trouble  uh i believe 33 years in prison why wouldn't he just for jerking off wow why would he just not  wipe the hard drive clean he probably just deleted stuff and didn't realize drag and drop into the  trash can and think it's gone no he was too busy wiping his belly clean yeah exactly it what a jerk  while he sells it on ebay yeah and gets 33 years in jail there you go just sell a computer by ripping 
[02:39:00]  the hard drive out that's unbelievable and then smashing it with a hammer i wouldn't be afraid  of throwing river i honestly don't have any porn that i would be worried about it's just normal  nonsense but it's like financial information i'd be scared of yeah that's the stuff you got to worry  about you know people the passwords things like that it's all stored in there somewhere 33 years  he got yeah wow very inappropriate behavior all right i must have jerked off a lot and then just

[02:41:00]  gonna be a bust no iraq will try the head cheese you're gonna love it and just eat it like a big  candy bar like a giant snickers he's just gonna be biting into it you get a knife and start cutting  into that you want the uh the other dana white clips yeah i want to hear what he said all right  dana white continued here about silva that's where we were before bill burr called nobody has been  more supportive of anderson silva than me talking about him being the pound for pound best fighter in  the world uh etc etc even after a couple of goofy performances i will call them goofy um you know 
[02:41:30]  i still stood behind him and supported him going you know i think this guy is incredibly talented  and in the first couple of rounds he started to uh you know he was showboating and doing whatever he  was doing and that's that's not what i'm into i don't like it uh if you're if you're the if you're  that talented be mike tyson go in and finish it in two minutes i'd rather have somebody say uh you 
[02:42:00]  know let's not buy the anderson silva fight tonight because he knocks people out in two minutes other  than he runs around like it for five rounds you know why that's why i don't want to buy the fight  i think he's a jackass where's that clip from i don't know it's uh the press conference  so it's probably just the press conference feed oh there you can pick up um you know i'm not too  oh okay then um silva finally talks and tries to explain what the fuck was going on  where is that clip here we go through a translator so it's a little weird 
[02:42:30]  um you know i'm not too sure where what school damien came from but this is kind of a a  uh i sent a message because i think he disrespected me morally by the things that he said  and um you know and this is just the message that if anybody disrespects me morally because i'm a  black belt and and i've never stepped into the ring and disrespected anyone verbally before the fight  and said things that he said so like i said my focus was to go in there and beat him up and punish him 
[02:43:00]  and unfortunately some people didn't like the fight um and some people forget that um it wasn't  the way that some most people liked it can always be about respect disrespected me stop it well those  guys you know i know it's just this fucking mindset that's ridiculous i want to know what he did what  did damien do i don't know disrespected him i don't know we really got to get dana white on the phone  because he's he's probably on a plane he fucking punished that guy yeah like i was 
[02:43:30]  terror terrified of him so if he punished the guy that's a good fight to check out no i'm still  confused he didn't knock him around like an idiot but he didn't knock him out it was fun to watch a  little bit of it though yeah oof he beat him up the same way he would have beat me up yeah damien  maya did about what i would have done just toy with you i don't know if damien maya landed more  than three or four punches in the entire fight geez it was horrendous performance all right the head  cheese is starting to take over the room a little bit yeah it really is it's making me 
[02:44:00]  sick all right we'll take a break would you suck the head cheese or lick it i don't think it's  i think it's gonna be pretty easy actually for the rock oh how do you think it's disgusting i smell  kind of like a bacon thing it'll be a different consistency in his mouth i'm hoping i'm hoping a  dead pig thrown on a fire would smell like bacon doesn't mean you're gonna eat it i'm open you got  a knife for that shit it's all fat too yeah it is a lot of fat in there boy

[03:14:30]  doesn't i'm still able to get aroused as frequently as i ever was but the the orgasm takes more time  is the sex drive lower uh it's lower in the sense that like i don't want to whack off like three times  in a day anymore but like when i'm in the situation i'm ready to go so that actually was kind of a  blessing that it slowed my libido down a little bit and sort of made it a little more normal or  regular but it is kind of annoying like coming is it takes a lot fucking longer you know what i mean 
[03:15:00]  so i don't know do you have a talk me out of it  keep your zoloft to yourself joe well doesn't it uh one of the ones that there's a couple kind there's  all off the like well butrin is doesn't affect your sex drive because it doesn't it doesn't target a  certain thing in your brain which ones do target that thing in your brain i don't remember my  therapist told me i have no idea i did absolutely no research on this whatsoever yeah somebody just 
[03:15:30]  said zoloft and i was like okay but you were about to say something and we moved on with a  whole bunch of questions for you but you said something about ever since i was a prozac paxil  oh yeah prozac they say is awful over here i'm saying somebody uh that it cuts your libido down  what now my mom's been on every single one of those oh really none of these drugs help by the  way joe did you you're gonna have this the rest of your life and make believe you're doing something  about it uh what happened as a child nothing happened it's just like this just general you 
[03:16:00]  know depression and i don't know dude ever since i was a kid like i remember being in like third  grade and waking up and being like like in my head you know i don't know how i would have phrased  it when i was in third grade but basically being like i can't believe i have to go put up with this  shit again today like i can't believe i have to go to the school with these people and it was just  always there but that's normal stuff too i guess so i think i don't know i know it didn't feel  normal i mean you don't did you ever feel like that oh yeah but like constant like all the time 
[03:16:30]  oh yeah really i absolutely should be on something i absolutely should do you have any extras all off  with you yeah you're suggesting he leaves a few for me jimmy yeah i like to put them in a pez dispenser  i'm going the other route though i'm talking my my shit out are you talking your shit out i used  to that was the other thing too i used to i used to get a lot out on stage and stuff that you know  what but we say that too with this radio show thank fucking god yeah rant and rave on this on this show 
[03:17:00]  i think it's easier it helps i i liked it better like having the radio like when we were doing  uninformed more frequently i liked better having like that radio outlet for it because there wasn't that  worry of like there's got to be a punchline every however many seconds or whatever it was like you  could just talk about it in an entertaining way and um but i don't know it was it was just this thing  where like i was going on stage and just i was just carrying it all the time all my material was about  being depressed and being angry and i just didn't i was just sick of hearing it i was like you know i'm 
[03:17:30]  just tired of this i need a fucking breather it's called irritable depression serious yeah it's  called being a comedian irritable depression yeah it's called irritable depression well how do you  fix it besides pills yeah yeah you talk about it you just talk about it in general i don't have  health insurance so i can't go to therapy um you can find a reasonable purpose either it helps yeah 
[03:18:00]  let's help me i think it's a band-aid it helps talking no talking is angry talking is good it's  it's gonna be if you're angry you're angry if you're depressed you're depressed sad you're sad  you just got to deal with it  ants got a 1940s way of looking at things that's me especially the jews i don't  jesus christ i don't i'm teasing of course i don't disagree with you uh uh  a hundred percent but i disagree with you i do too i think if you're hey don't get so angry 
[03:18:30]  i think if you're prone to sadness sure that'll be part of your makeup but yeah i think you could  fix it a little bit i think it's just pieces a little bit you know we all have our crosses to  bear as they say but if it was that if it was if it was that cut and dry and that simple then  people wouldn't just continue uh re-acting the same play they grew up with what if what if it's uh  something with you know has nothing to do with talking it out well that's what it has to do with 
[03:19:00]  yeah chemical imbalance it's like chemical imbalance or is it something that you need to  talk about or every girl who's abused i'd say 90 or whatever marry abusers that couldn't be  chemical it couldn't be it has to be something psychological and they don't even know they're  doing it and then you somebody and sometimes you talk about something that's what you do at  the end of an argument you talk it out and then you realize oh okay do you that makes sense  i just push it all down and try to forget about it just push it deep deep down go to try to forget  about it you push it so far down you make head cheese yeah yeah my problems are in head cheese 
[03:19:30]  you just go down to your basement studio and do more radio do some more radio or head down to the  range and blast off some rounds whatever it takes the uh you know what the biggest thing the biggest  thing for me was and this is this really is like to sum it up for me what it really helped with  because it doesn't zombify you or anything like that it just i had a voice in the back of my head  constantly questioning and second guessing every single thing i was saying and doing 
[03:20:00]  or opie you remember me i don't fucking hear voices no no that's that's you pal but you remember i  told you what my issues were you remember being one of those fucking weirdos what's what's the name of  the voice did you name them i think the name is o and a yeah all right now the uh do you remember  the time there was times like on the show where we'd be fucking around and laughing and having a  good time and shit and you would like slam me and then we'd go into the bathroom and i'd be like 
[03:20:30]  opie you weren't offended when i and you'd be like what are you fucking nuts dude no we're joking  like that shit like shit like that where i was like i couldn't and it was it was starting to become  like sort of crippling to me like professionally and personally i saw the last appearance of two  on our show you were a little different like wow he's taking this pretty fucking hard like he's  like he's really was i take what was what happened i don't know it would be beating you up a little  bit oh great is this going to lead to one of those conversations  you just took a handful of right right now he's got a fistful of it he just poured in his mouth 
[03:21:00]  like m and m said what do you mean by that get the fuck out of here i don't mean what do you  mean i'm saying what what was the situation i'm just trying to remember what obviously we're  fucking around and you know and i think you were taking a little like like you were taking it  seriously i guess i think i got mad at patrice yeah for saying you know this is actually a great  example that you bring it up it was the bobo thing and patrice said you took that whole bobo thing a  little weird uh i yeah it was like and i did not know that because because the one thing we 
[03:21:30]  will never fuck with on this show is your livelihood you know what i mean like your  fucking comedy is where you really make your money you guys do the show for free right so we've never  fucked with people's comedy ever like we beat the shit out of rich voss but he is a funny  motherfucker on the stage and we would never sabotage you know what he does to make a living right of  course so i hope you know that no no bobo thing we thought you could handle and i i'm not sure  that was the that was the right thing to do with you well you know what it ended up being really 
[03:22:00]  fun and a great goof and it's like there was a minute where i took it too serious that i did but  like i think that same day it was the same day patrice was saying hitch he was just trying to piss  me off and he was saying hitchcock sucks and hitchcock wasn't a genius and i remember getting so  fucking angry and he was we were obviously fucking with you i know but that's how seriously i would  take i just would go what the fuck you know like hitchhawk hitchhawk hitchhick hitchcock 
[03:22:30]  so yeah so anyways it's all a lot so it's helping it's been it's been nice you know  convincing myself no guys it's seriously shut the fuck up it's going on probably on like a low dose  probably right yeah like 50 milligrams a day i don't know 50 milligrams an hour  all right i have a pump i have like an insulin pump of zoloft it just keeps fucking pumping in  now joe i i remember when my mom was on 50 milligrams a day that's great i'm sure it'll 
[03:23:00]  stay right there for the rest of your life ah you know it's funny my mom is on gallons at this point  of drugs gallons it started with a lousy little 50 milligrams to even her out that's hilarious because  somebody just said to me today i go they go how's it going i go i'm a few weeks in it's going it's  going really well so far and they go yeah dude you take it for like a year or two and then you  go off i go i am never going off i feel great i don't want to go off you do feel different yeah  i do i really do and with that question by jimmy now we're looking at you and all kidding aside i 
[03:23:30]  don't see any difference in you so what's the difference between joe de rosa on the zoloft and  the joe de rosa not it's just not having that thing in my head fucking with me that's it you know the  the other night i went out with a bunch of the guys from red eye by the way they said and i they  that you killed a red eye oh awesome yeah i'm doing that show tonight was there an issue  do you have a problem right no no not at all not at all they're good they're good  they're so on the defense that's funny man 
[03:24:00]  holy no not at all why why would you say that did they say something to you that i need to know  about no but i went out we went out fun to hang out with the great show and drink they're great we  all went out drinking yeah and this this anchor from fox news that i didn't really know was out  with us and i was talking to her i'm at a good time and we started having this discussion about  monogamy in new york city and we had very differing opinions i was saying you could be monogamous in 
[03:24:30]  this town but it's fucking impossible because there's tits every three feet and you know girls  with their fucking snatch hanging out of the skirt and i said it's a lot easier if you live in a farm  if you're going to try to give up meat you don't work in a steakhouse you know what i mean and she  was like no you're either like mature enough to make the go of it or you're not doesn't matter  where you live surroundings right temptations and so we got into this huge debate for like an hour and  it got a little heated didn't get nasty but it got definitely got heated and had that happened 
[03:25:00]  before i was taking this shit the whole next day i would have been like i can't believe this i went  out with the guys from the tv show and they knew this person and i got into an argument with her  and i embarrassed and meanwhile as i was leaving all my buddies were like that was hilarious you  were right we totally side with you you know what i mean but that all would have been in one ear at  the other i just would have focused on the incident that happened wow it's it was not it's nuts it's  crazy confidence builder for you well let's not go that far i can guess uh what you had said you're 
[03:25:30]  more confident about what you have said so you're not second guessing it it's not necessarily confidence  the confidence is still shot in the barrel it's just it makes you more of an asshole i'd put it that  way you just don't give a shit if you've offended somebody so what how is zoloft different from beer  it's really not it's not and it amps up alcohol like a motherfucker yeah all those things apparently  uh you can really get fucked up on them three drinks and i am

[03:26:30]  dick jokes i'm afraid i might actually write something that's fucking out of the box  but yeah it scares me i gotta admit there was like i have been going through like an adjustment thing  on stage because it was like when i felt when i felt like the malaise as you put it uh you know  there was like this energy push that i'd give myself like i'd be like it's time to go on stage and  i would get like more aggressive and now i don't want to do that anymore i'm like i don't care so

[03:29:30]  shit for like seven eight months because he had problems with his girl and he was drinking vodka  and at first it was great he was back to normal everything was cool then he fucking blew his brains  out in my fucking living room wow did you replace the couch no good story on the door dude that's  that's wonderful that's uh was it as messy as feeding somebody head cheese in your living room 
[03:30:00]  wow it fucked me up for a long time much better now you should try zoloft  i'd rather do that you gotta pronounce that t i guess huh yeah zoloft yeah all right i always thought  it was a silent t i like the way you say it the soft death on the end zoloft yeah zoloft well i think  that's because that's how tyson said it right oh we have that clip thank you and teeth 
[03:30:30]  i'm on the zoloft thing right but i'm on that to keep me from killing y'all  how great is that it was so as a matter of fact like yeah i'm taking it look if i wasn't i'd you  know climb the empire state building i'm doing you a favor i'm doing you a favor this is not for me it's  for you did you see tyson the documentary i loved it it's great i didn't realize how smart the guy  was the the funniest part is when he goes when he's talking about don king and he goes then i 
[03:31:00]  hooked up with this slimy dirty reptilian motherfucker best line in the middle best  line in the room don king fucking hilarious man reptilian motherfucker yeah but he convinced me that  he was innocent with desiree washington because he was calling her i always figured like he was a  guy he got carried away but when he was calling her that wretched bitch i'm like nobody who raped a  girl calls her a wretched bitch in an interview he really means it i firmly believe that he was  telling the truth yeah that poor bastard lost three years of his life and i believed him too when he 
[03:31:30]  was like look i violated other chicks i just didn't violate her like for a guy to say something that  goddamn honest i was like you know what i don't think he did it right uh jamie in florida jamie  hey there how y'all doing what's up jamie i was wondering just i missed part of what you were  saying did you say that you woke up like at night sometimes with your heart just racing and just you  know like freaking out like what the fuck's going on yeah i wake up with like a stomach ache and i'm  worried about like my life and shit like that okay well you did i'm gonna have to do the replay for my 
[03:32:00]  husband for this because jesus christ he is just like that he's explosive you know the other night he was  just fine you know and then he i had to have him move my his car so i could get my car out and all  i did was say you know can you move the car god damn it you know it's just like jesus yeah that's  he just tripped out that's the whole thing here that's what the doctor was saying like you know it's  just sort of a general it's a general uh stabilizer it sort of evens you out and i still have the anxiety 
[03:32:30]  and shit but it's like when i wake up i can shake it off i used to wake up in the morning and it was  stomach ache from the minute my eyes saw the ceiling for the first couple hours of the day  just anthony just worry panic obsessing literally waking up thinking about my friends in comedies  websites and the work i saw them doing and i'm like like nuts absolutely nuts to the point where  i wasn't focused on the stuff i need to do for myself and now like i look back and i'm like you know 
[03:33:00]  things are all right i'm doing pretty good like what was i freaking out about so it's a weird business  though because you even though i i know what joe's talking about it's a weird business where  your peers are so it's like our peer in a way is chris rock he's a much farther advanced than we are  but it's like you look at these guys and you're like why am i ordained is a better example because  he's already kind of our age group and our like why am i not doing arenas it's like your peer group  goes from everyone to bob kelly or guys we're doing like kind of the same as to fucking guys that are  making eight hundred thousand dollars a night it's like what the fuck is wrong it's really hard to feel 
[03:33:30]  good about what you're doing but that's hard with anything really you know you got people at  certain jobs that are truck driver i'm not saying they don't have aspirations but you you pretty much  know where the range of guys is but in this job it's like and literally a guy who's doing it less  time than you all of a sudden has a fucking show where he's making 40 000 a week sports and showbiz  yeah yeah or the thing it's you know yeah this guy just got signed for 14 million dollars  and meanwhile you're on the minor league bus uh going from shithole city to shithole city 
[03:34:00]  and the worst is like yeah like like stuff will happen like you'll go pitch a tv show  and they won't buy it and then your buddy will go in and pitch a show and they'll buy his show  and you're like what what did i what did i do wrong am i an ass what and then but then the next day  you could sell a fucking tv you know what i mean there's no goddamn rhyme or reason  i can't but somebody could well you pick you pick a hell of a career yeah oh yeah it's a great  career for somebody with anxiety zero security yeah no no health insurance nothing nothing miss 
[03:34:30]  i'm sorry no go ahead go miss the important question is why why did you marry a rageaholic  what kind of upbringing did you have it's his last name benoit  he actually when we first got together he was on the night like a night shift type of thing and i  worked all day and so i mean we just didn't have as much time together this is talia shire from  the godfather you know carlo clean it up that's all you're getting bread believe it or not but you 
[03:35:00]  know he doesn't want to go on that kind of stuff and i really don't want him to either because of  the sexual side effects i mean i'm sorry but you know yeah we got all right we got striker who uh  had some sex problems because of his drug also joe because uh you've admitted to everyone you're  damaged you're you're not going to get health insurance now uh no i don't think it affects  health insurance i think because it's not a physical you allowed me to say that you're 
[03:35:30]  damaged what's wrong with you i don't care see i don't care anymore that's the point  yeah of course he's a comic no healthy person wants to tap dance for laughs no emotionally  healthy person does comedy why is that attention to me pay attention to me exactly it joe we need  you to come to lubbock texas for seven nights how much 800 no airfare sounds good sure will they love  me okay so could i possibly bang a waitress and jeopardize the measly money you're paying me okay 
[03:36:00]  i'll be there so jimmy you said uh all comics are damaged so what's brian regan's issue then you  think because he seems like a squeaky clean comic he does but i don't think his i don't know i i and  i know regan and sidefeld i know casually i don't know what jerry's thing is either but there's something  oh i know brian bro i would never say it no i would never say but let's just say this oh no no no not 
[03:36:30]  at all i went out i went out after caroline's gig with brian regan and we hit one of the bars right  around the corner oh boy and didn't leave until the sun was coming up and like like we're just  walking up broadway going on to our respective hotels after uh hanging out at this bar yeah but  while we were hanging out with the bar getting trashed on tequila brian just started talking like  a regular person so he wants to be that let me tell you something he's it was stunning and 
[03:37:00]  hysterically funny to see brian regan not the stage brian regan where it's like you know he  doesn't even say damn or anything like that material and turning into what amounted to mr hyde  that's great yeah so it was it was fantastic we all have our little things you know we all got our  things oh that's it all it all comes you know i envy i envy guys like regan like you jim you can  relate to this like you're a comic yes very let's go to break jim your name's jim right yeah you uh 
[03:37:30]  you go on stage you're very opinionated very personal on stage very cathartic and i've seen you  i've seen you have all shows where before you're at the level you're at now where the audience didn't  fully know who you are didn't fully get you and you would i could see you took it personally get  angry it's like i've always been the same way i envy guys i remember talking to steve burn one  time and he just goes you know man these people came in to have a good time i want to make sure 
[03:38:00]  they have a good time and and steve's my friend part of me though was like uh what do it do what you  got to do for you up there but the other part of me was like i'm really fucking jealous of that man  like that that concept of i'm just here to do a show like let's have fun let's have a good time  nobody gives a shit about your pills that you're on or your fucking troubled relationships and all  that you know and it's i envy guys that go on and just talk about the generalities of life 
[03:38:30]  no here's why i don't and i know what you're saying yeah because that type of a thing i like steve but  i would say in general that type of thinking that's like walking into a museum and saying like i really  want to look at somebody who who fucking finger painted like or who painted by numbers or who painted a  thing of fruit you've seen a million guys paint fruit i want to watch a guy who paints something  totally different like the comics that make me laugh are never guys who are fucking happy the  audience showed up yeah colin makes me like fucking he makes me a tell but a tell makes everybody laugh 
[03:39:00]  right tell will also bomb but dave is not a guy who thinks oh boy these folks want to have fun let's  have fun everybody no the one at the cellar one night he might have had a few and uh there was like  an interracial couple up front it was one of the funniest i've ever seen dave said i i see you went  and got yourself a piccanini dude i've fucking screamed i fucking screamed wow what a set of balls 
[03:39:30]  on him it's not about it's about any he does that with anything whether it's jews or the president or  any any type of social situation a tell is not going to respect what he thinks the audience wants  from him he's going to do what he thinks is funny and that's why it made me laugh he's dave's one of  the only comics i've ever seen that has resented an audience for laughing at something like he'll say  something you know and you could tell it's not the exact joke he wants to do and then they laugh all  of a sudden he goes oh yeah like that that's hilarious let's go to striker striker hey morning 
[03:40:00]  boys what's up strike hey uh about six or seven years ago my doctor put me on wellbutrin for because of  i was having panic attacks and yeah it helped calm those down but it fucked my sex life up so bad wow  i'm sorry but my therapist and i talked about walbutrin she said it doesn't mess your sex drive 
[03:40:30]  up you know what about what my uh doctor told me was it affects everybody differently and in my case  what the situation was is i could get a heart on no problem the wife and i would start  fucking and then all of a sudden i would just lose my heart on and it'd take me four or five minutes  to get it back well tell him to lose some weight yeah maybe walbutrin improved your eyesight  christ christ oh god almighty it's like getting lasik surgery 
[03:41:00]  i could never get out i i would sit there i i could i could go for an hour like that and i would  never come wow improve the sense of smell this is not pleasant this is not good  so you have 20 20 years i thought it was your shoes right yeah oh well so what do you do now  buddy i just you know what i gave up on it i just stopped i told my doctor and he said well  he says you know he says your options are that or nothing and i went with nothing and i was fine for  a couple of years and i hear about two or three months ago i started having some problems again and 
[03:41:30]  when i went back and saw my doctor here a couple weeks ago he was like well he says you know you  know what some of the side effects are because i mean being a truck driver i have to be careful  with what i take of these drugs too and you know and he's like well you know he said that's one of  the few that i can give you that there's zero side effects to and i said except for the sex life  deal and he goes well yeah that's true what else is it besides walbutrin like joe's taking  zoloft what else is it like kind of like zoloft and what is like walbutrin i know those two are different 
[03:42:00]  i you know what my dad takes prozac and he hates it because like he can only take it for so long and  he has to come off of it because it'll mellow him out so bad that he doesn't even feel like himself  anymore so you know he just had to stop taking it and there was another one that my doctor had given  me and i've been wracking my brain trying to think of the name of it i can't and it did all right except  for the fact that if i took it in the morning about three hours after i took it i fell asleep  and so i'd have to take it at night before i went to bed and i i can't remember the name of it but 
[03:42:30]  that was my side effect to it was it just knocked my ass out i we don't want to say this they're just  showing footage of the uh the hopkins roy jones jr fight all right so why would that be funny  yeah i did notice with uh like if i'm with sexually if i'm with the girl it's fine but 
[03:43:00]  with like masturbation is where it really slowed me down i have to masturbate to filthier things  every like usually i can masturbate to regular shit and then every once a week i'd say let's go to a  creepy place tonight just for something a little different every time i masturbate now i got to  find the sickest fucking clip because it's just too it's too hard to do like it's just deep well no  i mean on the on the medicine because it just it's just not it just takes ultimate arousal to be able 
[03:43:30]  to just to bust one out you know what i mean let me uh let me go to peter massachusetts thank you  striker peter yeah i take uh selexa and it's the same thing i fucking jerk off for like 20 minutes  and i can't come and then it makes me really tired like i drive all the time and i get really drowsy  to the point where i think i'm gonna fucking fall asleep behind the wheel while i'm driving so  sounds great well yeah i'll just take my own thing i'm unhappy a lot of the times and i think  about killing myself but i jerk off like a fucking chimp i make a lot of comes these folks 
[03:44:00]  you should try jerking off while you're driving that'll keep you awake i think about doing that  right now okay very hard to find any like sexually well the lexapro is a bad one i guess visual stuff  brian and harrisburg brian yeah i think i think what striker was trying to say was with the lexapro  it's like a zoloft and that that just sucks man i you can't come at all like my girl's got a 
[03:44:30]  finger bang my asshole for about a half hour so i can get get a load out well that's that's  good lexapro really fucking shows your true colors doesn't it why the fuck are you nancy  why isn't that part of the black guy having sex with my asshole in order to even uh keep it hard  why isn't that part of the commercial though you know side effects may include right finger  banging your asshole to come i always needed a nice finger bang in the asshole so that's that's  nothing really new to me i love it i can't the midget from willow is on television what an ugly 
[03:45:00]  fucking woman that is wow is she fucking horrible oh jesus christ um yeah i i like a little bit of  a finger in my asshole but i can't take a fucking a whole bunch  what do you mean that's so funny i can't take like my girlfriend trying to fuck me with the strap  on i couldn't take it i couldn't take it i could i got like an eighth of an inch i was done i can't do  the strap on but i like a nice finger in there and the gooch is your fucking is your ass clean 
[03:45:30]  i try to clean it up oh my god jimmy that's a great visual now that i see the picture you are  great oh that's great fucking we have pecs remember will when i was a kid i love that movie that's  warwick davis he played uh the main ewok in star wars in return of the jedi oh did he yeah  him and billy bardie are the two most famous little people little fucks yeah you know one of the famous  midgets just died from the wizard of oz that's right the one that pronounced the wicked witch 
[03:46:00]  dead yep said she is most sincerely dead or something like that remember that line did they  say that at her funeral they died yeah that's a little fucking midgets funeral how did he die  it just amazes me that there's still midgets from the wizard of oz alive yeah like they usually  drop dead especially with the medical shit from back then when he was born well this is a problem  we're gonna have to pump and fill up some kind of drugs and use uh electric shock treatment how  did you live this long were you really from oz yeah were you really a magical munchkin you're magic 
[03:46:30]  because a lot of those little fuckers lasted a long time they weren't supposed to right  oh midgets don't last a long time you think when he died his feet curled up  yeah his little striped socks curled up feet he was crushed by a dust bunny  barbie playhouse i bet you i bet you i was just gonna say that i bet that's what it says on his  headstone he was in the wizard of oz good riddance right yeah good for you 
[03:47:00]  you think he was sick of uh talking about the wizard of oz by the end of his life it's probably the  only reason every time a woman would go to throw a drink on him he'd probably say you ever see the  wizard of oz and she would sip it and listen and take in the story every time he said hello  throw a drink do you know how many fucking cranberry and seltzers he had thrown in his  fucking ugly face oh maybe you like me to buy you take this fucking take this genetic deformity  that was in a movie once exactly take this one fucking mention on imdb right
