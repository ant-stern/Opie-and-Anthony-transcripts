<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, originating from a balcony at the Crazy Horse in New Orleans during Mardi Gras, was a chaotic mix of raunchy humor, drunken antics, and bizarre encounters.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with their crew (Steve, Jimmy, Ben, and Kenny "Club Soda Kenny"), spent the majority of the show throwing beads and drinks from their balcony at unsuspecting revelers below, often targeting their beverages and gleefully recounting their successes in graphic detail.  This was interwoven with studio banter filled with vulgar jokes, primarily focusing on Steve's food poisoning (possibly from a previous night's meal), Anthony's dislike of their location, Martini Steve's limited stomach capacity due to gastric banding, and their extensive, highly offensive, recounting of their negative experiences with a belligerent drunk named Tom the previous night. This included Tom's excessive food ordering, inappropriate touching of women at a strip club, dropping his phone in his soup, and Opie's subsequent act of drowning Tom's phone in a glass of water.

The show also included a segment ostensibly addressing sexual harassment in the workplace, which was oddly juxtaposed with their ongoing, offensive bead-throwing activities.  Further contributing to the chaos was the independent antics of a crew member dubbed "Master Poe," who was roaming Bourbon Street handing out WoW stickers and attempting a spontaneous dance performance, occasionally receiving bead bombardment from Opie and Anthony across the street.  A Vermont Teddy Bear live read was inserted amidst the mayhem.  Jim Norton joined the broadcast, adding his own brand of graphic humor with a detailed account of his previous night's exploits at a strip club, culminating in him masturbating during a lap dance.  The conversation frequently veered into discussions about Anthony's upcoming celebrity poker tournament and potential gimmicks (suggestions ranged from diapers to bull balls), the recent Patriots Super Bowl victory, and Dave Letterman's commentary on the halftime show.

Two lap dancers, Chloe Love and Reagan, were brought into the broadcast. They discussed their careers in the adult film industry (mentioning films like "Angels of the South," "Melted Pink," and "Blowjob Girls 2"), their participation in the G-String Awards, and an upcoming event at the Gold Club Cabaret.  Chloe and Reagan engaged in explicit sexual acts with Jimmy on-air, detailed by Opie and Anthony. A caller, Lady Di, briefly participated, followed by another Vermont Teddy Bear advertisement during which one of the women simulated a lengthy orgasm.  Opie’s brother, Brett, also participated, recounting his experiences witnessing a religious procession and accidentally knocking a beer from a woman's hand.  Multiple hostile encounters with people on the street are recounted, with descriptions of beer spills and escalating arguments.  Numerous attempts to interview Lou Ferrigno via phone proved unsuccessful, hampered by the loud environment and reportedly by his deafness.  The show’s conclusion involved further descriptions of the chaotic bead-throwing and escalating conflicts, punctuated by a Steven Lynch song.  A "Hi, Mom" prank call, involving a caller pretending to be jailed for drug possession with a prostitute, added a final layer of outrageousness to the broadcast.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the audio was frequently interrupted by the sounds of Mardi Gras, loud music, and the general chaos of the surrounding environment.  The show was rife with sexually explicit comments and descriptions.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  This morning, while the city sleeps, an uncommon band of heroes unites to fight the forces 
[00:03:30]  of evil.  The Obi and Anthony Show.  Oh, my sweet Jesus.  With Op Op.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  Act, Act.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  Ben looks like curly-spliced film.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Whenever Steve yawns, it looks like the back of the Batmobile in a exotic...  ...paw ketosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up. 
[00:04:00]  And armed with superhuman powers.  He pulls his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers, Opie and Anthony.  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Ooh.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Sleeping on the street.  It's my Mardi Gras shirt.  Shut the fuck up.  What the hell?  Did you leave it on a parade route?  I don't know.  That is the most wrinkled shirt I've ever seen.  You're a disaster.  Have you seen how everyone else dresses around here?  At least they're well ironed.  That's true.  That actually looks like the shirt Kennedy was murdered in.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hey.  Stay tuned here at Mardi Gras.  Yeah, we have spread the virus to Mardi Gras.  Why?  We still don't know.  I think there's enough virus here for everybody.  Believe me, before we even got here, I think there was...  The city is steeped in virus.  Ugh.  It was funny.  We moved the show inside for now, and then we're going to go out on this balcony, and  I was looking at Anthony before the show, and Anthony goes, I will never be back here  again. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, we've said that in the past.  We said that last time we were here.  For some reason, we came back.  Technically, I think it's working better, but the same stuff, I mean the same stuff that  kept us from wanting to come back again is firmly in place.  Yep.  The stench, the belligerent drunks, and I'm just talking about our own crew that we brought  with us, and I looked at Steve.  I didn't mean that, Steve.  Yeah, thank you.  I appreciate it.  Steve is under the weather, and it's not because of alcohol poisoning today. 
[00:06:00]  Nothing to do with booze.  He ate something, I guess.  I guess he had some kind of food poisoning happening, and I'm scared because I had the  same thing he did last night at dinner, which we'll get into in a minute here, and  he's really sick.  He's got the Pepto-Bismos and Bismo.  Bismo-Bismos.  Pepto-Bismos.  And he's way under the weather, definitely.  I am green.  It has nothing to do with the drinking.  No, it has nothing.  No, no, no, no.  Maybe that olive was bad in the martini.  Yeah, that one olive in that one martini.  No, there was nothing.  It may have something to do with my little reduced anatomy. 
[00:06:30]  That's true.  That is making this.  Your penis?  What?  Yes, thank you.  My small penis is making this food poisoning exponentially worse.  Yeah, for the new listeners, Martini Steve has a very, very tiny stomach.  He used to weigh about 400 pounds.  What are you down to, 260?  260, 265 now.  So, and he can't handle his food.  He had it banded or something, right?  Yeah.  In essence, they put a cock ring around your stomach.  Exactly.  And this cock ring around my stomach is preventing me from vomiting up whatever nastiness I have 
[00:07:00]  inside me.  So, it gets, I can't puke it up.  So, it just gets, I try to, and it gets stuck coming back.  So, it's just got to work its way back out the other end, right?  Exactly.  Like a horse.  He can't throw up.  He just stands there and eats oats until he dies.  Creep.  Thank you.  You know, I got to acknowledge one thing.  Does XM realize that this is a complete waste of time?  No.  I mean, we've been in such a great flow back in New York.  The radio show has been rocking.  We're really throwing some great radio programs at the listeners and stuff.  And then they sent us down here. 
[00:07:30]  Into a combat zone.  To just kind of party and just talk about it.  Hang out.  Like, we have a ton of stuff we could talk about, but we're not going to get any real  radio done today.  No.  If we were back in the studio, yeah, we would be talking about the news, things like that.  We don't even have a newspaper.  I have not seen a newspaper since we've been here.  I have not even scanned over a newspaper since we've been here.  What was that?  Steve's stomach?  Yeah.  Steve, what are you doing?  You want a newspaper?  All right.  Yeah.  Get to USA Today or something.  There are actually newspapers around here?  There's one on your door every morning.  Well, who the hell can read here in New Orleans? 
[00:08:00]  So, but I just want to acknowledge that because it was so frustrating because yesterday we're  trying to do a radio show.  And then Anthony and I realized, what are we doing?  It's all about just drinking, looking at girls' tits, and trying to knock drinks out of people's  hands with the beads.  Which is fine if you're not doing a radio show.  Right.  Because before the show started, we were doing just that, and me and Jimmy, at least, didn't  want to even start the show.  So, we wanted to stay out there and throw beads.  We are the, Jimmy said it, we are the assholes here.  We are the assholes here. 
[00:08:30]  Out of everyone here at Mardi Gras, we are the assholes.  Everyone else is throwing the beads out to people.  So, we're holding them in our fists, clumped in a ball, staring at people, trying not to  let them see us.  And then when someone puts their head down with an open drink down the street, we fire  at them.  And if you can knock that drink out of your hand, we laugh like retards.  And it is the best feeling when you leave someone covered in Bloody Mary, wondering,  you know, I had a drink a second ago, and now it's just completely gone.  It is the best thing. 
[00:09:00]  And we were laughing our asses off.  And the best part, you guys have been like nailing people with headshots and things like  that.  I mean, really hard with really big beads.  Yeah.  And then they look up and they see the beads on the ground and they pick them up and go,  thank you.  Yeah.  And then they kind of think.  I have no idea that they're just a moving target.  You know, me, Jimmy, your brother, we're going for the drinks.  Very small target.  Very strategic.  Ben is, he's cackling like a madman, throwing these heavy, sharp beads at women's open backs  with the open back shirts.  He's like, did you see the fat slut I hit across the street? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, Ben, we saw that.  Jim wanted to hit her first.  Jim goes, I'm going to hit her.  And you tossed it.  You missed.  And then I hit her two seconds later.  I kind of called it out.  I was pointing and I was saying fat pig in the green shirt.  That was code for throw beads at her.  And I was trying to knock her drink out.  And then stupid sociopath just started throwing them at her fat back.  And it was kind of funny.  It made a whipping sound when it hit her.  So it's going to happen.  We're going to try to do a little radio.  Then we're going to go out on the balcony.  And this whole show is just going to be commentary as we try to nail people with beads. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, that's what it degenerates, too.  Let's lower the expectations.  If you're out there in Radioland expecting a great Mardi Gras broadcast from Opie and Anthony,  it ain't going to happen.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll have an interview with some of the float people, the people that go on the floats  in the parade.  Or we'll talk to maybe the mayor of New Orleans.  He'll come up and tell us about Mardi Gras and how it's changed over the years.  Well, it is Pat Tuesday.  Does anyone even know what that means?  Nope.  It's Tuesday at Lady Di's house.  No, I have no clue.  That's Fat Drunk Tuesday. 
[00:10:30]  It's just an excuse to let people dress up in the most whacked out costumes you'll ever see.  It gives carte blanche.  It's Halloween out there.  Yeah.  Guys are dressing like fairies, but it's okay because it's Fat Tuesday.  This is one of those days like Halloween in the village in New York City that just is  an open invitation to gay guys to completely come out of the closet and dress like gay  people, like slutty fags.  Right.  I saw a guy walking down the street. 
[00:11:00]  What the hell was he wearing?  He had an open-ass chaps on.  Oh, no.  He had a cook apron.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One guy was wearing a cook apron with nothing on the back.  And a chicken mask.  And a chicken head mask.  And he was choking a chicken.  He had like a rubber chicken.  And then his hairy ass was there for everybody.  Waiting for him to see him giving a BJ at the Overlook Hotel.  He opened up the door.  Great party.  The best part about that, there was an old lady following the guy just taking snapshots 
[00:11:30]  of his ass as he was walking to bring home with her.  Laws go out the window.  People just drunk.  I mean, the drunks that come to this thing.  Because you wouldn't come here unless you're a drunk.  Now, what Club Starter Kenny said, walking back from breakfast, he said, this is the  land of the raging alcoholic.  Yeah.  It absolutely is.  People just drink at all hours.  The bar in the hotel opens at, when are they open?  Like 6?  The bar at the hotel.  You don't even have to go to the actual bar.  They have a wet bar set up right in the lobby. 
[00:12:00]  The bar in the lobby of the hotel.  In case you can't get to the bar in the hotel.  If you need a drink before you can even get to the bar, which is probably 20 feet away.  Yeah.  If you're in the lobby going, I need a drink now.  Yeah, they put a bar in the lobby for you.  I think people come down here just to justify their alcoholism.  Yeah.  Yep.  Because they walk around at 7 in the morning with these just hurricanes and the craziest  bloodies.  A lot of bloodies.  The spiciest bloody marriage you'll ever drink in your life.  Look at me.  Yeah.  And they look at each other like, oh, see, I am normal after all.  Yeah.  Everyone else is like me. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a big group hug for drunks.  Here's all you need to know about Louisiana.  The state bird is a bloated liver.  By the way, we finally found something that Master Poe is good at.  We finally found something you're good at.  We're calling Master Poe, the Master MC.  He's out on Bourbon Street as we're up here doing a radio show, handing out WoW stickers.  Like, I've never seen anyone hand out WoW stickers.  And he's starting, like, a whole line dancing thing in the middle of the street with girls  that walk around.  He's Danny Terrio with a gi.  Right.  He's not handing them out. 
[00:13:00]  He's taking the WoW sticker out, and he's getting girls to bend over, and he's, like,  gently taking his time putting it on their ass and sending them off with a WoW sticker  on their ass.  But you see what he does before he even sticks it on their ass?  Like, the girls bend over.  And normally, you would just bend at your knees or maybe bend at your waist to get low  enough to put the sticker on.  He bends down into this pose like when someone in the Matrix comes down from high height and they  land on the ground in that cool little unique squat pose.  That's how PoW poses.  And then slowly wipes the sticker. 
[00:13:30]  He's got a whole ritual that he does.  And then he actually had a dance line going in the middle of Bourbon Street.  He got girls together, all WoWs all over him, about five girls behind him.  And he starts dancing, and the girls are, you know, copying his little dance.  A spontaneous dance number.  And then he grabbed the wireless mic from the bar across the way, and he's just making  just announcements to all at Bourbon Street that we're broadcasting live.  And you would think we would appreciate this and sit there and go, wow, PoW is really tearing  it up, doing a good job.  No.  Opie starts getting fistfuls of beads and pelting PoW with damn good shots, I must say. 
[00:14:00]  We're completely across Bourbon Street.  PoW is on the other side of Bourbon Street.  And Opie nailed him first shot square in the top of his head.  Well, I'm a frustrated pitcher.  I wanted a pitch when I was going out.  It was fantastic.  And then PoW went to point another time, and Opie had just thrown it, and the beads  went around his finger.  It was a great shot.  It was an amazing shot.  I've got to give myself credit on that one.  And that's what we've been doing, throwing beads at people.  Yeah.  So it's a lot of fun. 
[00:14:30]  We're at the Crazy Horse.  Last night after the show, we went downstairs, checked out some of the local talent.  I hung last night.  I was out of the room.  I hung for the duration.  I got an announcement.  Howard Hughes left his hotel room and hung out with us last night.  I had my Purell.  And you were spending money like Howard Hughes, too.  I had my boy in the plastic bubble suit that I walked around in.  Oh, I was spending money like Howard Hughes.  Dude, you're, I mean, it's getting ridiculous, because we walked out of the front door of  the hotel.  Well, no, we had to go out the side door or whatever.  And the smell was too bad for Anthony.  So he wanted to walk all the way around the block, even though we had to go, like, what, 
[00:15:00]  30 yards to the left?  It was so disgusting when we walked out of that hotel.  The stench of vomit and garbage.  And I would love to be able to really convey that to the audience, but you can't.  This is a smell that you cannot even convey.  Picture maybe if you just were up vomiting all night into the back of a garbage truck, and  Tom from New Orleans breathed on you.  And then dumped stale beer on the puke.  Yeah, yeah.  Stale beer on the puke. 
[00:15:30]  Have you used your hotel sponge yet?  No, I haven't.  They give you sponges for your shoes to wash your shoes off.  Yeah, in every room, you get a little shoe sponge that you could use to wipe off your  shoes.  All I know is I had to wash my hat off last night, which is saying something.  I had gunk on my hat.  And when gunk is spewing up that high, God knows where it was coming from.  I think that was last night when we, what did we do last night when we got back to the  hotel?  Oh, that's right.  We stood out on the balcony and threw beads at people.  We somehow got into the Southern Comfort Party and then just, like, elbowed our way up 
[00:16:00]  to the balcony and started just throwing beads at people.  Kenny absconded an entire box of beads.  That smelled like cat urine.  They smelled like cat urine, the beads.  Smelt like cat piss.  So we had big fistfuls of these.  And again, we were just throwing them, heaving them at people's drinks and cackling like  idiots.  Norton is having a great time with this because you usually don't like to hang either, but  you found something you're really into.  I'm loving it, dude.  You're obsessing about just knocking the drinks out of people's hands with the beads.  All I'm thinking about is what time the first break is so I can begin pelting people  with the heavier beads that we have.  We have good, heavy beads. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, I called one that I had before.  I was with Brett, Obie's brother, and I was like, dude, I got the Bunker Busters and just  wadded it up.  It was the size of, like, a cantaloupe in my hand.  And some guy walked by, and it's really hard to miss when you got beads like that because  they just spread out when you throw them.  And I nailed this guy, and I swear to God, he looked like it just zapped and disappeared  from his hand.  He had no clue where it went, what happened.  And again, the laughter ensued up on the balcony as we hide like faggots.  Yeah, we just cowardly ducked back. 
[00:17:00]  We ducked back so they can't see us.  My brother's a good shot, no?  Yeah.  Oh, he's been scoring some great hits.  Yeah.  Great hits.  It's a fun game.  Well, we, so after the show, we went downstairs and got some lap dances, hung out with some  of the strippers and stuff.  Oh.  And then, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I was trying to, I actually felt like I was staying away from you guys, and I didn't mean  to do that, but I was trying to stay away from Tom from New Orleans.  Now, Tom set this up for us here on this balcony, got us a great spot.  So, for that, thank you, Tom. 
[00:17:30]  For anything else, ugh, you're a mess, a disaster, and a pain in the ass to hang out with.  So, right after we're done with the show, and during yesterday's show, mind you, he was  constantly annoying us.  Yeah.  Constantly annoying us.  The times you heard him annoying us on the air, that was only on the air.  Off the air, he was constantly annoying us to where Club Soda Kenny was ready to just  treat him like beads and lob him into the crowd.  Just a pain in the ass.  So, when the show gets done, we all go downstairs to watch some dancers.  I sit down with my girlfriend and Jimmy. 
[00:18:00]  You guys are still upstairs for a little while.  And I came down so quickly because I didn't want to stay up here with Tom.  So, we sit down there.  You guys gather in the corner, and Tom goes over by you guys.  So, now, I didn't want to come over there and hang with Tom because he's a pain in the  ass.  So, I'm just looking over occasionally, watching him molest the dancers.  Just grabbing him like a bowling ball.  His fingers are wandering into their ass cracks.  They're all upset.  They're going to jump off of him.  I got to tell you, though, he's got the move because he makes it look like it's by accident. 
[00:18:30]  But, you know, he knows exactly what he's doing.  He was feeling up girls.  He was, like, you know, rubbing their, you know, their intimate areas.  He's grabbing crotch.  And then the girl would get pissed off.  He's like, oh, I'm sorry.  Like, he acts all naive and stuff.  But, he had to move down.  I saw a girl push his hand away from her crotch.  As he was, that hand was being pushed away, his other hand wrapped around and grabbed  her tits.  It's like, this guy's got no, the nerve.  You got to respect that.  She's fighting him off.  He's like a rapist in slow motion.  And he's just getting hammered. 
[00:19:00]  I think he was on shrooms yesterday.  He was talking about mushrooms.  And then he wants to drive 12 of us to another strip club where you get, what, three BJs  or something?  I know a place where you can get blowjob, boys.  It's going to be great.  Just hop in my vehicle.  I'll drive.  I would sooner get in a car in the 70s with Billy Martin than with this guy.  Who was driving with him?  You could not be drunk enough.  Maybe Steve.  You could not be drunk enough. 
[00:19:30]  Unless you're a technician at XM, maybe.  Did you get in the car with him?  Jaime got in the car with him at the dinner?  You must have been hammered.  Either that or you didn't see enough of Tom to understand he was...  I was called in, told, I got a surprise for you by a certain person who's downstairs dancing  like a fucking monkey right now.  I won't mention his name.  Paul, I got a great surprise for you.  You got to meet me.  Go to the place where you guys were having dinner.  Yeah.  Pops out of his, whatever.  He was laying on the fucking floor. 
[00:20:00]  Tom, hey, let's go party, guys.  I'm like, oh, shit.  That was my surprise for the night.  And then you had to get in a vehicle with him?  Needless to say, it was really shitty.  Wait, you drove with him?  No, he wasn't driving.  Somebody else, that guy was driving.  Oh, that's even worse.  I'm sure he was in train shape, too.  Oh, is that the guy wearing the same shirt he had on last night?  Exactly.  My whole goal at dinner was, because he's a super fan, was to piss him off to the point  that he'll never listen to us again.  Oh, this guy.  You really pissed him off.  We are at this place, and all they're talking about is the show, and I'm like, look, beautiful 
[00:20:30]  girls.  What are you doing?  I want to sit next to him at dinner, and he didn't shut up about the show.  So then Anthony is a man of his word.  We went to dinner on his tab last night.  Yeah, well, you didn't finish the story downstairs.  Oh, there was more to it?  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Oh, Tom then gets, and this was the beginning of what I saw also at dinner.  Tom decides, well, we're all going to drink, obviously.  The shot girl starts coming over, and he's like, come on, shots for everybody. 
[00:21:00]  Shots.  We're all doing shots.  So I figured those things are pretty small, and the apple, the sour apples are really good.  My girlfriend was having a couple, Steve maybe.  And so we do all the shots up, give it to the shot girl, and we start, you know, looking  at the dancers and talking again.  Well, then the shot girl comes over and goes, I'm really sorry, but that's $15 for the shots.  And I look over, I go, I thought Tom had these.  I go, and not like I thought Tom had these, get the money from them, but I just wanted to 
[00:21:30]  know what happened.  I thought Tom had these.  No, he said, no, he's not paying for them.  So I'm like, all right, no problem.  I give the girl, you know, $20 or whatever.  She says, thank you.  For the rest of the night, she's apologizing to me that this scumbag was, you know, Welshing.  And he was the one that said, you know, shots for everybody.  Lap dance is fair.  He gets people lap dancing and doesn't pay for them.  He is a menace.  And that was just the beginning.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  Because then at dinner, he was trying to order what?  We get to dinner.  And that's just, he is, we walk into the dining room and it's just horrifies everybody else  there.  I understand it's Mardi Gras.  It's going to be loud and everything.  But Tom is one of those loud, embarrassing to be with, belligerent drunks.  And he's just ruining everyone else's night that's trying to just maybe get a couple  of minutes away from the crowds on Bourbon Street to steal away with his girlfriend or  something.  And there's Tom.  Let me tell you, I fuck her in the ass. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Tom, what?  Yeah, this couple was sitting real close to us.  It was a whiz at the host of this place to sit them right next to our table.  Ruined their evening.  The guy with the eye patch?  Yeah, the guy with the eye patch comes in with his chick.  They sat him right next to us.  Dining room had plenty of open tables for some reason right next to us.  They've got to listen to Tom.  So we sit down.  We get the menus.  And Tom goes, the waiter comes over.  Tom goes, all right, let's get one of every appetizer on the menu for the table.  Like we're all going to, like the big man's going to order everything. 
[00:23:00]  We'll all pick at each other's and stuff, which I fucking hate.  I hate dealing like that.  You get your menu.  You order your appetizer, your main course, your dessert, whatever the frig you want.  You order it yourself.  You eat it yourself.  If you want to share it with someone, fine.  And let's make it clear.  Tom knew and everyone else at the table knew that you were picking up the tab.  Yeah, because we talked about it on the air and stuff yesterday.  So that was his first move.  I didn't let it go for two seconds.  The second he said it, I go, Tom, wait, wait, wait.  You paying for this?  He goes, no.  I go, good.  Then order your appetizer, your dinner, and everyone order theirs and deal with it that way. 
[00:23:30]  Because you know what happens?  You get the big shot.  He's acting like a big shot that orders an appetizer, one of every appetizer for the table.  It ends up a big pile of food that completely goes to waste.  Or there's something you want that Tom all of a sudden takes his filthy fork and shoves it in it.  And now I can't eat it because it went into his mouth, which is a whole other story unto itself.  Filthy moth.  That horrible hole.  And I told him no. 
[00:24:00]  So everyone, you know, orders individually.  That's the way it's done.  Yeah, but then you've got to remember that he grabbed Steve's appetizer and started eating that.  Oh, my God, yeah.  So the waiter, I guess, brought over Steve's appetizer and inadvertently put it in front of Tom.  Tom takes that fork and digs it into the appetizer and starts eating it.  And Steve goes, where's mine?  And Tom goes, oh, I think I got yours, and goes to hand it back to Steve.  We all lose it.  Because who the hell is going to start eating out of that? 
[00:24:30]  It's like eating a kibble out of the dog's bowl.  You know?  He's just not going to do it.  Yeah.  Awful, awful man.  He's digging it in, trying to pass it back.  And then Ben starts digging in and eating it.  Ben actually ate out of that.  Yeah, Ben was drunk enough to start eating out of Tom's plate, which all of a sudden made my girlfriend almost puke.  Yeah, she actually put her hand over her mouth and said, I can't look at him eating out of that.  Everybody was, you know, that you were eating out of his plate.  I'd rather eat ravioli after it was dumped in a septic tank.  How did you just dig in and munch things?  First of all, he hardly touched it. 
[00:25:00]  We're in New Orleans.  Hardly.  Sample a lot of food.  The food is fine, but after it's been in his mouth?  It wasn't his mouth.  If a fork goes into half the side of the plate, it's not in.  It goes into his mouth, forked back in.  Scrapes teeth and taminated.  I'm with these guys.  I mean, his teeth are so awful, you just can't go there.  Mushroom-laden gums and green teeth.  I got to ask, I mean, I have to ask, Jim, what did I do to you that you would give?  Well, wait, before even that, he dropped his phone into his soup.  Right, right, right, right.  He was fumbling with his phone the whole night, Tom. 
[00:25:30]  Had it out.  I think he was calling Opie.  No, the phone rang.  Oh, that's right.  It was the Crazy Train ring, Ozzy's Crazy Train.  Yeah.  So he kept holding it up, going, look, Norton, I love you, Norton.  Look, Norton, and you hear Crazy Train playing because that's his ring.  And he's so drunk, he starts fumbling his phone, and it was slow motion.  I saw him trying to catch it and gather it up, and it's just, it's bobbling off of each  of his fat little drunken fingers and just plops face first the phone right into  his creamy soup.  It was crawfish biscuits. 
[00:26:00]  Crawfish biscuits.  His phone just goes splat, and he's like, oh, damn.  So then Norton decides to do one of his gags, and he gives Tom my cell phone number.  Well, Tom was asking for my number.  He's like, I want to call you, Norton.  I want to test if my phone works, so let me get one of your numbers.  And I said, sure, of course, and I gave him Opie's cell number, so he just continues  to call Opie.  It was great.  At dinner.  At the table.  Over and over again, he's leaving messages, even though he's like five feet away from 
[00:26:30]  me.  Hey, Opie, how you doing?  How's your appetizer?  Could you imagine sitting with this idiot at dinner, people?  It was a nightmare.  You shouldn't have picked up your phone, by the way.  Someone gave him my cell phone number, and I'm like, go ahead, call.  That's my own cell phone.  My old cell phone.  It's not mine.  So he starts dialing it, and I feel it vibrating in my pocket, and he's looking at me, and  I won't even acknowledge that I feel it.  Go ahead, call.  That's my old number.  Keep calling it.  My phone was on the table just bouncing around because it was unvibrating.  It was pretty obvious that he nailed it.  So I'm like, you know what?  This is funny and all, but I've got to teach him a lesson because I know what was going 
[00:27:00]  to happen.  I know it's all good here at Mardi Gras, but we're going to get back to New York, and I'm  going to get drunken phone calls from Tom over and over again.  So I don't know how I got him to get ... He handed the phone to me to mess around with  it, and then I handed it to your brother, who then handed it to you, trying to get the  soup out of it.  Right.  And now we knew.  It was like ... Now, when I saw Opie with his phone, I'm just ... I know Opie.  I've seen it before.  I'm like, oh, this is not good.  This does not bode well for Tom's phone.  So then I go to dial numbers, and I erase my number, right? 
[00:27:30]  Right.  And then I just proceed to dangle it over my huge glass of water.  It was one of these big, huge mugs of water, like a tumbler, and I went, oops.  Oh, but don't you do it.  And I went, oops, dropped it right into the water, goes to the bottom of my tumbler of water.  And the whole table was like, oh.  That phone sank like a five-year-old at Tommy Lee's house.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:28:00]  Wow.  And it was great, because you could see it was lit up, and then as it hit the bottom  of the water glass, you just saw it go, like the lights on the Titanic before it went under.  Yeah.  It just kind of blinked a couple of times.  It went dark.  Oh, Opie.  Opie, give me my phone.  And then he's trying to get it to work the rest of the night, which it didn't, much to  Opie's glee.  Oh, yeah.  I almost got him to give it back to me a second time, because I was telling him I used to 
[00:28:30]  work for a cell phone company, and I know what to do to dry out your phone.  He was so close to giving it to me again.  And you guys thought I was going to just throw it back in the water.  Yeah.  At that point, I was just going to smash it right in front of him on the floor.  Smash it on the floor.  The guy just hung up, but someone from New Orleans was trying to get on the show.  He said that Master Poe got a wow sticker on TV down here.  He did.  He got on what was being taped in the 3 o'clock news.  We didn't know if he would get on, but he did run right in front of the camera.  Well, someone in New Orleans here saw it on local TV. 
[00:29:00]  He was an animal down there.  He was an animal.  How many people were murdered overnight, Ant?  Did you watch the local news?  I didn't catch the murder report.  I got home and passed right out, man.  Yeah.  I was exhausted.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  We're going to head out onto the balcony and see what's going on, but we want to start  the show in here at least.  Well, we can do that live read when we come back, right, for Vermont Teddy Bear?  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're broadcasting live from the Crazy Horse.  We got Eric back in New York.  Eric, just play whatever.  Oh, we got something picked out in honor of Tom harassing the strippers?  Yes, exactly.  All right.  In honor of Tom harassing the strippers, we got a little something to play for you guys. 
[00:29:30]  And we'll continue.  It's Opie and Anthony live from Mardi Gras at the Crazy Horse.  You hear about sexual harassment on TV, and it makes the headlines in newspapers.  As an employee, what do you need to know about it?  First, sexual harassment is against the law, and it's against your company's policy.  So what is sexual harassment?  Linda, you are doing a fine job here.  Oh, well, thank you, Steve. 
[00:30:00]  But, you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work.  I'm sorry?  I mean, we're talking about your job here.  There may be physical harassment.  Wow.  You're really tense today, Nancy.  Ow!  Bill!  Sorry.  You looked really tense.  You know, I really don't like it when you do that.  Can you please stop?  I'll never stop, Nancy.  Never. 
[00:30:30]  In some instances, the harassment may be verbal.  Word around the office is you've got a fat cock.  Yes, I do.  I've got a fat cock, too.  Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime.  Maybe a little oil.  Two fat cocks together.  Oil.  It might be visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings. 
[00:31:00]  Sexual harassment is not always about sex.  It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate.  Man, I could go for a power fuck right now.  Change is slow, and what was acceptable in common behavior years ago can now be sexual harassment.  Smells like vagina in here.  Excuse me?  Smells like fresh vagina in here. 
[00:31:30]  Are you talking about my vagina?  Maybe.  Everyone wants to be treated fairly and with respect.  Treat your co-workers with the courtesy and respect that you want for yourself.  It's your company's policy, and it's the law.  Live from Mardi Gras.  They are funny, entertaining, and don't take themselves too seriously.  Hi!  It's called sarcasm!  Hello, exactly! 
[00:32:00]  Oh, yeah!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  XM202, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ow!  I get another Bloody Mary.  That'd be nice.  Dang.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Live from Mardi Gras.  We're out on the balcony at the Crazy Horse.  It is just a sea of people down there.  Ow!  And it has begun. 
[00:32:30]  It has begun.  Yes.  The pandemonium.  It's a lot more crowded today than it was yesterday.  The sun is kind of poking through the clouds, so it's pretty humid and wet.  And you know what that means.  It's like soup down there on the streets.  It's people's soup.  You've got the steam and the puke rising up from the street.  Yeah.  It's kind of, yeah, very humid up above.  And look at this.  Look at that hairy animal. 
[00:33:00]  An animal.  A lot more people, though.  And I'm noticing, too.  Now, don't call me out on this, but a few more hotter chicks today than there was yesterday.  A lot more hot, hotter chicks.  Which makes them worthy of throwing some beads down.  That chick is wearing like a Steve C. flaming Mardi Gras hat, only it's purple.  Wonderful.  And she obviously knew someone was trying to knock the drink out of her hands.  Now I have some very heavy, clear-colored beads in my hand. 
[00:33:30]  And I see an open drink below me.  It's a guy drinking out of a boot-shaped big plastic glass.  Wow.  You knocked that out of his hand, Jimmy.  And I wish I had a rock.  There it goes.  That's a good one.  Goodbye.  Fucker.  Oh, shit.  Did I hit him?  Oh, my God.  Dude.  He's looking up at me, and he wants to kill me, and I had nothing.  It bounced off his hand and swung and hit him right in the face.  And some beer came flying out of his cup and went all over his shirt.  Did I hit his stupid beer cup?  You were such a coward and ducked after you threw it. 
[00:34:00]  Maybe you would know for yourself.  No, the trick is you can't stand there looking like the guilty party.  Why don't you just point and laugh?  What did Oswald do?  He got out of the book depository.  I'm not just going to stand here.  No, I understand that.  Didn't you see Jimmy having a Coca-Cola?  Yeah.  He turned around and looked up and gave me the finger.  Wow.  That was a good one.  That really was a great shot.  That was a great shot, Jimmy.  All right, I got another heavy one.  Here comes a chick with awful Jersey hair sipping out of a...  She's walking away.  Yeah, she's getting out of range.  It's a weird thing here.  They've got to be in perfect position. 
[00:34:30]  They kind of fly into your trap, you know what I mean?  And if they kind of zig to the other side of the street, you get a little disappointed.  Because some of these people have these huge cups and they're a great target.  Anthony, you should try and knock out that cell phone right there.  You know something?  We've left this little crowd in the middle alone.  They're guys that just decided in the middle of Bourbon Street, they're plopping down with  a cooler and ice and beers and they have open cups and everything and they're just drinking  in the middle of Bourbon Street.  I don't know why, I just realized why.  They're fans of the show.  Yeah, and we've completely left them alone. 
[00:35:00]  So they're watching us pelting other people.  They're kind of in the safe zone.  Ben is just wailing people on the head.  He doesn't care what they're carrying or anything.  No skill.  Before the first break started, there was three black guys walking by.  They worked for a catering and there was one...  They all had food wrapped up and I threw a big bomb trying to knock some catered food  out of their hands.  But it bounced off, unfortunately.  It really is a...  It is the game to play if you're up on a balcony.  Dude, we are the dicks.  We are everything that's wrong with Mardi Gras.  They're all drinking and having fun and we're being just...  Look at the other balcony. 
[00:35:30]  They are all hanging over and what they do is they hold a bunch of beads in one hand  so people can see them.  They take them off one at a time and nice, gently throw them down at people.  We're hiding and throwing like a fastball down.  Okay, look at this one right here.  The red glasses.  No, no, the chick, yeah, with the red glasses and the big cup.  Okay, here we go.  Go ahead.  Goodbye, drink.  Fuck!  Mister.  Oh!  And they're all...  There was like five shots we threw at it.  That girl's going to have a lump on the back of her head. 
[00:36:00]  Her boyfriend got a little pissed off at that.  Yeah, too bad.  We are truly scumbags.  All right, you guys, really fast.  We got to go to Master Poe.  He's on the street.  Oh, Poe is on the street, of course.  Locking two girls.  Let's see.  Let's see.  And does his mic work?  Nope.  He's just yelling and no one can hear him.  He's yelling into nothingness.  Of course he is.  All right, we can't hear him.  We can't hear him.  We'll try again in a minute or two.  We can't hear him.  Look at him.  He's still going.  He has no idea.  See the guy with the band hat on? 
[00:36:30]  Where?  Hi, hi.  They're waving now.  Jesus Christ.  Oh!  I was just going to throw the beads back.  I was going to throw a bunker buster.  Watch this.  Oh, right in the beer.  Perfect shot.  It landed.  Someone's wearing almost like a Mummer's Day parade outfit, and someone threw it right  in her drink.  She was able to hold on to the drink, though.  Yeah, but she's wiping beer off her fat neck.  That's right.  Beat it, stupid.  Oh, I'm going to try to get rid of it.  See that guy right there?  Oh, perfect shot.  Some guy had a drink.  Ant just dropped the purple heavy bunker buster beads over the guy's wrist, and he got beer 
[00:37:00]  all over himself.  And another guy that was able to hold on to his drink.  Wow, are we just the worst?  The women are more likely to drop their drink.  They seem to be able to hold on a little bit less.  Yeah, their fragile little wrists just give out under the pressure.  But the black guys never drop their drink.  No.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah.  And, of course, yesterday, Ope is aiming at people in wheelchairs.  Yeah, that was a little much.  Yeah.  I have another huge fistful of gold beads here.  See that fat woman right there?  Where?  She's double fisting right there. 
[00:37:30]  Watch this.  I'll wait until the baby carriage goes by because I'm nice.  Yeah.  Oh, I hit the cup, and she held on to it.  She probably thought it was a chicken like the fat bitch.  Okay, here comes a guy with an open beer holding a chick's hand.  He's got beads on.  All right, who's going for it?  Oh, you hit him in the face.  Brett went for it.  And I'm just looking at my brother.  Went for Ben.  Ben did it, too.  I actually just look away like I didn't do nothing.  Highlight to Bombardier.  Yeah, throw them cups.  Don't give away our beads.  There you go.  Look at this staggering drunk.  There's a staggering drunk eating a hot dog right there.  Where, where, where?  He's got a full beer right there. 
[00:38:00]  I don't see him.  See him, Jimmy?  Right there, right there, Jimmy.  Oh!  Oh, yeah, I see him.  Your brother just threw it and missed.  All right, here's a guy right below us.  He's looking at Elvis glasses.  Yeah, that's a good one.  And a really bad, like, really bad.  He's looking up now.  All right, now he's not looking up.  I just act like I was itching my head.  Nice shot.  Wrapped around his wrist, but didn't quite have enough energy to it.  Yeah, there's nothing better than this.  People who are listening, you don't understand the beauty of just throwing things at people.  Are you going to throw these?  There are these, um, we call them Dago beads. 
[00:38:30]  They're like, uh, they're red, white, and green.  And they are so pointy and sharp, they can actually do damage to somebody.  Yeah, but you can't curl them into a ball.  Oh, you can't?  You got to throw it like Oddjob throws his hat and hope it takes someone's head off.  Like a buzzsaw.  The weird thing is, none of these people have any idea that we're just beaming them with the beads.  No.  They all look up all happy, like, hey, yeah, give me some beads.  Yeah, I'll take some.  Thank you.  I have probably the biggest beads I've thrown yet.  Oh, my God.  This thing, these are really heavy. 
[00:39:00]  I can't fit them all in one hand, and I am going to wait for the ideal situation.  It looks like Hands Across America if you did it with Down Syndrome children.  That's how large those beads are.  Okay, I have a big fistful of these beads.  I need somebody for target acquisition.  How about that guy's holding an open?  There are some people that are very smart, and they have covered cups.  We don't go for that.  We don't go for the cans.  Right there.  Open beer.  He's pouring a giant Coors Light in a red shirt. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, I see.  He's a little far, though.  Yeah, look at Coors Light.  And now he's looking up.  Wave at him.  All right.  Wave stupidly.  Okay, see this guy right there?  Oh, someone just threw at him.  Yeah, he just missed it.  Yeah, I think Brett threw at him.  I'm waiting, and...  You've got to wait for the perfect opportunity.  He just put his head down.  This guy right here?  Yeah.  With the white t-shirt?  Yeah, should I do it?  Right there.  It was so crowded down here.  Oh, someone else threw again.  All right, now they're looking up.  Now they're looking up.  Annoyed.  No stupid.  You want to come up?  Oh, girls want to come up?  The two chicks want to come up, so let them up.  You know what?  I've been telling people not to let people up.  The two chicks? 
[00:40:00]  The guys I've been telling not.  Maybe chicks, but...  Yeah, come on up.  No, Ben's saying no.  Ben's saying no for some reason.  Because guys come up here.  I've got to tell the fans also.  So if you're down here at Mardi Gras and you want to come up, it ain't going to happen  because other people ruin it for you.  They come up, and it would be cool if they just came and hung, but they don't shut up  about talking about the friggin' show two hours after the show's over.  It's still blah, blah, blah.  They just go, shut up.  There's a guy with a king's hat.  He's wearing a king's crown.  What about this guy with the red cup? 
[00:40:30]  I'm going for him.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, yeah, that's perfect.  I'm going for him, dude.  All right, you've got the huge...  Oh, Bunker Buster.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Where's the red cup?  I don't want the chicks to grab it, though.  Baby carriage.  Watch out for the baby, Ben.  Oh, my God, Ben.  Ben is throwing it at infants.  I was trying to hit the guy's coat.  Why don't you just throw a coat hanger down?  Here we go.  You just missed the baby in the baby carriage.  Now he's looking up.  Oh, he looks like Tom, doesn't he?  Yeah.  Not really.  He's on two feet.  All right, Anthony.  There's a chick over there I'm going for.  Big kitsch. 
[00:41:00]  Goodbye, drink.  Shit.  Oh, you hit a guy in the face.  Nice shot.  You've got horrible aim, Jim.  No, I don't.  I very good at it.  You were doing much better before the show.  Jimmy makes it up in quantity.  He's like a Gatling gun.  He keeps firing.  Of course, something's going to hit eventually.  I don't see any opportunity.  Okay.  What about...  We already threw it, Fatty.  There's a chick over there with nice big cans wearing an awful black cowboy hat.  And she has two pieces of like a boa coming off each end of the hat.  Is that real topless right there?  Yes, she is, Anthony. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  I'm going to knock the drink right out of that Spacto's hand.  There's a guy with his hand up.  He'll probably grab the beach.  I can't do it.  All right.  All right, go ahead.  Try to get Fatty with the feathers on her head.  No, I can't because she's looking up.  And there's too many people looking up now.  Yeah, they'll grab the beach.  Sometimes you get a perfect shot and someone grabs it right out of midair.  Ruins the whole thing.  We'll take a break in the beat action for one second.  We've got to talk about the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, Anthony.  Of course we do.  Valentine's Day is right around the corner.  And I hope you're not thinking about giving the same old boring flowers and chocolate. 
[00:42:00]  It's been done, right?  Of course.  The ladies out there, I think they're looking for something a little more original than that.  So we suggest you send your wife to go find something with personality.  Vermont Teddy Bear Company!  Bullseye!  Oh, Jimmy.  Bullseye!  Jimmy just got a one-quart cup of Budweiser out of some guy's hands.  Oh, that poor son of a bitch.  And it was full.  Oh, you scumbag.  And all the Opie and Anthony fans down there were all cheering like crazy. 
[00:42:30]  We have a group of about, I don't know, 30 or 40 fans just kind of hanging out, checking  out the show from below.  And she was going and took out that beer.  They went nuts.  Excellent shots down there.  So we're talking about the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, Anthony.  Something different.  Something original for your girlfriend or wife.  And they've got every bear you can imagine to reflect your personality.  Bears with attitude.  We're talking about, like, the Loverboy Bear with the Heartshake Love Tattoo, the Gangster  of Love, the Heartthrob Bear. 
[00:43:00]  That's a bear that's wearing boxer shorts.  Or the mysterious Love Bandit Bear.  Just a few of the many examples of bears they have to offer right in.

[00:44:00]  Some guy was taunting.  Someone hit his drink with beads.  And he was taunting, like, I still have my drink.  Norton had the shot of the day so far.  That was a great shot.  That really was amazing.  You guys, we've got to go to Master Poe again if he's paying attention.  Let's see if we can get to Poe.  Well, hit him in the head so he knows we're going to go to him.  Well, that's your job.  Oh, you got him in the shoulder, Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm good.  Master Poe, we're going to give you another shot.  Yeah, you're on, Master Poe.  Master Poe is down on the street of Bourbon Street.  He's the master emcee.  And here he goes.  Let's see if this is going to work this time around.  He's trying to turn the microphone on. 
[00:44:30]  If you didn't like it.  All right, everyone, we're going to party today.  Hey.  We're broadcasting live from the Crazy Horse, Opie and Anthony show.  Give me one more.  All right, ready for some steps?  Hell yeah.  Let's do some steps.  Hey, let's go.  All right.  I suppose this is a dance step.  Yes, my darling.  You want a wow sticker?  What is your name?  Essie.  O and A. 
[00:45:00]  Say O and A.  O and A.  What a crowd motivator he is.  What is that?  O and A show.  Oh, that's cool.  That's right.  That's Anthony, that's Opie, that's Jim.  Can you wow them?  Wow.  That's a slide to go.  All right.  I've seen Charles Wittman work a bad crowd from a tower.  Come on, let's go.  I suppose just doing dance steps.  Turn off his stupid microphone.  Pose dancing for radio.  Isn't that great? 
[00:45:30]  The electric slide in the middle of New Orleans.  And it's easy to slide on vomit.  He's just brilliant.  I wish he'd do the face plantage of vomit.  Is that a dance move?  It's what Master Poe deserves.  Move out of my way.  Are you going to try to hit him again?  Go ahead.  Bean him.  He's closer now.  He's in the middle of the street.  He still thinks he's on the air.  He has no idea.  Oh, God.  What a heinous set of cans that woman just showed for beads. 
[00:46:00]  There are some atrocious women.  There really are.  All right.  All right.  See this fat slob in the pink?  Where?  Watch with my bunker buster.  I will attempt.  Oh, she just got hit in the head.  Oh!  Oh, you hit her arm.  Anthony hit her arm.  And some drink flew out into effect.  And, of course, fat slob wouldn't drop her beverage, so she held on to it.  But she got some on her piggy little wrist.  Oh, she's flipping up the verse.  She got so pissed off.  I've never seen anyone as pissed off as that lady just got.  You know what happened?  Three of us up here, I aimed for her. 
[00:46:30]  She was like Steve defending a cub.  By the way, they're on to us.  They're starting to throw the beads back pretty hard.  I know.  We're going to have to watch now.  There may be an all-out bead war soon.  Broadcasting live from the Crazy Horse on Bourbon Street on the balcony.  Got a hot chick here at the strip club, by the way.  Costume is a big thing for Fat Tuesday, Opie.  So you're seeing a lot of people with bull heads.  There's a guy over there with a bull head mask.  And a lot of guys dressed up like women.  Look at this guy.  He's wearing a skirt and leopard leg warmers. 
[00:47:00]  I noticed it's okay to be a fairy down here is what it is.  It's quite all right if you're a gay man and want to dress the part and just walk down the street.  Because that seems to be what a lot of people are doing.  And I've seen a lot of black gentlemen dressed as gladiators for some reason.  I don't know what's going on with that.  We've seen a few of those.  By the way, Master Pose still thinks he's on the air.  He has no idea.  I love it.  He's still talking into the microphone and dancing.  It's Master Pose Dance Fever.  I'm just putting my thumb up towards him.  I'm thumbsing him up. 
[00:47:30]  So he keeps doing it.  Yeah, he's trying to keep talking.  What a buffoon.  And we had to stop Ben and Tom from whizzing cups at people yesterday.  It's like, hey, how many guys have yellow Opie and Anthony hard plastic cups?  Yeah, just us.  I think they'll be on to us.  All right.  Oh, that's a nice target.  In the corners where the gutters are in the street, it is just littered with filth.  It looks like somebody just took a garbage truck and emptied it along the street.  It's literally that dirty.  We noticed this morning they didn't even bother, like, cleaning up the streets at all. 
[00:48:00]  They just said, ah, one more night.  You know what I'm amazed at here is the amount of backing of the WOW stickers.  Now, you can't see all the stickers because people take them, put them on themselves, on other things.  But you can see all the white paper from the back of the stickers, and it's littering the street.  And plastic cups.  If people drop their plastic cups and it goes into the gunky gutter water, they just kind  of leave it there because you can't touch it after it's been in that filthy water.  How stupid is Master Paul?  He still thinks he's on the air.  He's working the crowd. 
[00:48:30]  Has no idea that we gave up on him ten minutes ago.  Fire over here!  Fire over here!  O&A Party Rock!  O&A Party Rock.  Party Rock?  What?  I don't know.  Keep his mic on for a second.  Nice phonics.  Yes.  Okay, red drink, striped shirt.  Someone just went for it.  Damn it.  Missed her.  Wow.  Oh, she's pissed.  Who cares?  Damn it.  I was going...  You know, I'm at the end of the line here.  I don't get to throw at anybody walking this way.  That's up, baby.  You rock.  Oh, oh, Pilot to Bombardier.  The guy's got a...  Oh, there you go. 
[00:49:00]  Wow.  You guys rock.  Oh, thank you.  Like the Holy Grail.  I suppose Mike is working again.  Oh, great.  That's cool.  All right, let's turn him off again.  Let's turn him off again.  He's talking...  Oh, someone just got a great shot on a guy's beer right there.  I think it was your brother again.  Your brother's a crack shot there, O.  Yeah, I've noticed he's doing quite well with the beer thing.  Who are these freaks on the balcony?  That's not Tom, is it?  Oh, all right.  I thought Tom was back.  Now, it's the same guy walking around yesterday with the inappropriate bell.  Why is he up here?  I don't know.  How did he get up here? 
[00:49:30]  I don't know.  Ben's like, no, you can't let the hot chicks up here.  But we got the guy ringing the goddamn inappropriate bell.  I didn't let him up here.  I was told due to fire laws.  Not so many people up here.  Due to fire laws, yeah.  Yeah, look at every other balcony.  I know, but that's what I was told.  If you let someone up here, you'll fire.  Pretty much the fire law.  What I noticed this morning, they were reinforcing all these balconies.  With what?  Just like two-by-fours.  Oh, really?  And scaffolding.  Oh, they prop it up with like lolly columns or something.  Wow, that would be fun to watch one of these fall, huh? 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  I'm sure it has happened in the past.  Still to come on the show, Anthony.  I don't even know.  It's going to get worse.  We're going to talk to Lou Ferrigno.  How is that possible?  I thought Lou was deaf.  I thought he was deaf.  Plus the fact that it's louder than I've ever heard in my life.  What is Lou Ferrigno plugging?  Anything?  I don't know.  He's on what, Ben?  Like the King of Queens.  Oh, he's on the King of Queens.  We're going to talk to Lou Ferrigno at 4 o'clock.  Oh, he's coming in?  No, he's just going to be on the phone?  On the phone?  That's going to just be awful. 
[00:50:30]  How are we doing a phoner with Lou Ferrigno?  Wow, look that up.  That was a good move.  Yeah, that's brilliant.  That's got to be our brilliant booker.  Let's be in the loudest place we could possibly be in, talking to a deaf guy.  Yeah, on the phone.  That's fantastic.  And also, a little later, we're going to be having lap dances live on the show, right?  What?  Yeah, Norton's going to get a lap dance live on the show from one of the girls here.  It's a crazy horse.  My mule right now is probably a quarter inch, because I finished myself off in one of the  strip clubs last night for $2.50, and then I scrapped to myself when I got back to the 
[00:51:00]  room.  I was disgusting.  You are the horniest human being on the face of the earth.  I was a disgrace yesterday.  There were some hot dances here last night.  Did you hear what he said, though?  What?  He finished himself off at a strip club.  What do you mean?  What happened?  I went to a strip club.  I don't even remember the name.  I just wandered in, because it was a chick out front.  And I happened to look at one of the girls dancing, and I noticed that she had a nice  two beers, one hand.  Oh, go, go, go.  Two beers, one hand.  Damn it.  I hit it, but it didn't fall out.  And I noticed that she had very lovely camel toe. 
[00:51:30]  So I paid for a lap dance, and she said she would show me it for an extra $40, and then  for the next dance...  Wait, wait.  For $40 more, you're going to get to see it.  It's actually bare nude.  All right.  And then one more dance I gave her money for, and she said for $150, I can whack my...  I said, I'm going to whack myself off, because that's $100, and I'll do you for $150.  And I'm like, well, how much if I can go down on you?  Wait, so then you decide you're going to go down on her and take care of yourself.  Yeah.  And she would have done you with her hand for a price?  So for $150 plus the dance, she stands over me on the couch in a private area, and she's 
[00:52:00]  just rubbing on my mouth, and I'm going, and I just finish myself, all of my fat stomach  and appendix scar.  It was disgraceful.  Oh, God, is that disgusting.  It was disgraceful.  And the whole thing costed $250?  Yeah, but it removed the obsession, because I would have wound up going out with dumb Tom  to another strip club.  Why wouldn't you...  I think I would have opted more for the one...  How much was it for her to do it?  $150 or $150?  Yeah, why wouldn't you go $150 and have her do it?  You ever have a girl try to do that?  They're horrendous at it.  They yank out pubes.  It's awful. 
[00:52:30]  I would have wound up getting annoyed.  The song would have ended, and she would be like, well, I have to start over.  That's more money for the next song.  It's not like you're getting it from a virgin high school girl.  She's a pro.  I had to take care of it myself, because I wanted to see what she had.  I wanted to, you know, I wanted to...  All right, you're like, let's make a deal up there.  Yeah, absolutely.  I figured you'd go for the box.  Yeah.  Nice.  And that would all make sense, because you ended up hanging with us last night, because you got rid of  the obsession, because you've seen Curry relax when we were hanging on the SoCo balcony last night.  I could have had Curt number one, or I could have had chlamydia behind panties number two.  That shows chlamydia.  I think you made the right choice. 
[00:53:00]  Why not?  We need some more beads down at this end of the...  More beads, please, for the two stars?  Yeah.  We need more beads down here.  I have a best bomber right here.  Oh, wow.  Yo, you guys.  All right.  I've got to find somebody.  All right.  As you're looking for a person to take out with your beads, we're going to take a break.  All right.  We're at the horse, Mardi Gras, Bourbon Street.  We've got some ladies that want to meet Jim, so we'll go back inside so we can have Jim  get a lap dance.  How's that sound, right?  Very nice.  Nice.  And, all right, yeah, we've got a little something from chemistry as we go to break. 
[00:53:30]  So, all right, play chemistry, and we'll be back at Mardi Gras, the ONA virus spreading  across America.  The virus is inside us.  OAVirus.com.  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just pests.  You can't exterminate with black flag.  Your webpage just got hijacked by whack bag.  The gag order's gone.  Time to go to war.  Steve sees napalm burning down your door. 
[00:54:00]  It's hardcore.  Apart from whores you dump on Norton's belly, the only other girl in this life is Bob Kelly.  Not you, when he was a kid he sucked cock too.  These two obnoxious shock jocks might shock you.  Ass coward, he don't want to get involved.  Slip in your PJs and light a Java log.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus. 
[00:54:30]  Live from Mardi Gras.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah, hold on.  The virus.  The Opie.  The Opie and Anthony show.  XM 202.  Everything you say to me.  I need nothing to do.  And I'm about to break.  I need nothing to do.  I need nothing to do. 
[00:55:00]  And I'm about to break.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program broadcast live from the Crazy Horse.  Stepping inside for just a minute or two.  Taking a little breather from the craziness that is Mardi Gras outside there on the balcony, Anthony.  To the listener, it must be just like, you know, we're outside and then we're inside.  But Jaime's going crazy to get us back in here from out there in time.  Because he's got to take everything.  We don't have two camps set up.  One outside and one inside.  So we've got to take all of our equipment from outside.  Bring it inside and hook it up.  So you'll hear, like, you know, ten seconds and Jaime's still plugging stuff in. 
[00:55:30]  And then right at zero, we're ready to broadcast.  He really knows what he's doing, though.  Yes, he does.  He is the man.  We almost lost him last night on a trip with a stupid Tom.  Yeah, that's smart to be driving around with him.  Where did Norton go?  To take a leak, probably?  Yeah, I think he's introducing himself to the ladies.  To be preparing.  What's going on?  We've got two really hot ladies out there.  They're from the sister club of the Crazy Horse?  Yeah, they're doing an event.  Oh, this is the G-String Awards that they're doing tonight, right? 
[00:56:00]  Not the G-String Awards.  Is that tonight?  Is it tonight?  Oh, no.  Annual four-day competition begins Wednesday after Mardi Gras.  Okay.  Oh, I was going to say.  I know the G-String Awards.  I mark it on my calendar.  At the Gold Club Cabaret.  And a couple of the girls are here.  Are they going to lap dance for Jimmy?  Yeah.  They're going to do some lap dancing for Jimmy.  Jimmy's back on his stool.  The girls have to sign the, you know...  Well, Poe was out on the street for a while, so now we're all backed up.  How long is this going to take?  Somebody that kind of works for the O&A organization has noticed something, by the way, about Master 
[00:56:30]  Poe.  What's that?  And I've got to bring it up now.  You know, back in New York, how everyone has to go through the process of signing their  release forms and stuff.  Yeah.  Remember when we had that fatty in doing the news for like two minutes and we said, next,  bye?  You know how long it took to get through security with her?  30 seconds to a minute.  Good point.  Yeah, she was sitting there waiting.  You know how long it took the PR girls that were really hot to get through security?  Puerto Rican girls?  At least 20 minutes, because what he does, he sits them in that little booth area and 
[00:57:00]  takes his time and this and that.  Chit-chats.  Chit-chats, takes pictures for his own collection, I do believe.  I need something half nude, please, for security purposes only.  Yeah, exactly.  Just in case you bust in here naked, I have to know what you look like.  So Master Poe's back up here.  He's getting the girls through whatever, this security thing, and they're signing releases,  and then eventually they'll be on the air.  So I guess, once again, we'll just have to fill time until all that is taken care of.  Steve, how you doing, man?  I feel like shit.  I just saw a face come over him that was like pain, and he just dug for his Pepto-Bismol. 
[00:57:30]  It is restraint to not...  Just don't breathe near me, because I don't want to get sick.  All right.  You should do a Pepto-Martini, man.  Oh.  I wouldn't be surprised if they had Pepto-Martini somewhere.  I don't think you can catch that type of viral thing from airborne.  I think you need some kind of contact with fecal matter.  It's a stomach virus, yes.  Yeah.  I think we'd actually have to make out, Jimmy.  I think you need to shove a digit in and then lick it.  Then how'd you get it from Eric?  That's what he said.  He said, I think I got it from Eric.  I don't know.  I don't know, but he's sick.  Eric's back in New York. 
[00:58:00]  Eric's back in New York, and he's got the same thing I do,  so the only thing I can think of is I got it from him.  I don't know.  Well, you might have to do a little more thinking, because he's somewhere else.  I got sick.  Ramon, clean this up.  Does Ramon have to clean out your dirty underwear, because you're leaking?  Ramon is definitely on underwear duty tonight.  It looked like Opie's sheets at the hotel, because the chocolate's mint melted.  I actually got sick in Pittsburgh.  I got a little ill.  Maybe I got it from you.  No, no, no.  You couldn't have got it from me, because I've been taking dumps the last three days.  Not that anybody wants to hear this.  And they've been really, really dark, which is nice, like blood sausages. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, God damn.  Oh, Jesus.  Stop.  Which supposedly means that internally there's something really wrong with you,  like you have internal bleeding.  Yeah.  So I'm really nervous, but someone said it could have just been a lot of roughage  or some other type of food I ate, so let's root for the lettuce.  Yeah, root for the lettuce.  You've got to think right around now.  XM is rolling their eyes in Washington, going,  we sent them to New Orleans for this.  This will be the one time Hugh Pinero turns in to hear about my bloody logs.  Sorry, sir.  Well, you did have those steaks.  You ate, like, red meat. 
[00:59:00]  I ate a lot of red meat this week.  Oh, yeah, so that's probably what it is.  Okay, I hope so.  That'll do it, yeah, definitely.  Really?  Yeah, red meat will do that.  Okay.  I was just analyzed on the air by my two friends, and I accept your diagnosis.  There you go.  Oh, Los Angeles poker.  We're going to do that, right?  Oh, that's right.  That's going down.  All right, will you finally start talking about it?  What is it, the World Series of Poker or something like that?  No.  Oh, no?  It's not that one.  Why?  That's the good one, right?  If you get me thrown off of this thing before we goddamn get in.  No.  It's the World Poker Tour. 
[00:59:30]  WPT.  Oh.  The Celebrity Pro Invitational.  Oh, I don't know this stuff.  Well, that's why I'm telling you.  All right, Anthony, what's going on with the poker thing?  I'm a huge fan of the Texas Hold'em poker.  Yeah.  You've seen it on TV.  I'm sure everybody's, you know, flipped around and stopped and given a little listen to it.  Well, I have been cordially invited to be one of the celebrities involved in this year's  Invitational.  It's by invitation only to play with other celebrities and poker superstars in Los Angeles, 
[01:00:00]  in Hollywood, for their Invitational.  That's coming up February.  What's that date, Ben?  It's two weeks from tomorrow, which is the 23rd.  23rd, I believe.  Yeah.  That's all right.  We leave two weeks from today for L.A.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're on the road again.  We're going to be in L.A., and I'm going to try to eke this out.  I know it's going to be a challenge.  Guaranteed one day I'll be in, but if I make it the second day, you know, to that final  table. 
[01:00:30]  Isn't it almost impossible to make it to the second day?  Almost impossible.  The pros are so good.  I mean, you've got to be skillful.  The luck has to be there.  It's, I'm only, you know, I said this.  If I can sit there and outplay one of the pros for one hand, I'll feel great.  It'll be that rounder's moment, you know, that you're sitting there and you take on one  of the pros and you actually beat them in a hand.  That's all I'm looking for.  I've got to play the stupid role here.  What makes the pros that much better than someone like you and I that just plays poker? 
[01:01:00]  Has nothing, not nothing to do, but you wouldn't believe how little it has to do with the cards  in your hand as it is how you play, how you bet, how you bet your hand, how you read  your opponent.  These guys, they're professionals.  They understand every aspect of betting, of reading people, of just the instinct they  have.  Someone like Howard Lederer, the instinct he has to look at his opponent and know what  that guy is holding. 
[01:01:30]  That if he's betting big, if he's coming over the top of him with a raise, that he knows  he's bluffing.  And he'll come back at him, you know?  And it's that kind of stuff that someone like me just, I mean, it's next to impossible  to overcome.  Are you going to have a gimmick?  Like the Unabomber?  The Unabomber, who, by the way, I saw him on TV last night, the Unabomber.  The Unabomber won last year's Invitational.  Oh, okay.  All right.  He's the guy that won the last year's Invitational.  That's okay.  I was just going to take a little sip underneath my mic.  All right.  I was trying to help you out there.  Well, we've got to come up with some kind of gimmick for you. 
[01:02:00]  You want a gimmick for me?  Like, what can I do?  I know some people got the gimmicks, the glasses upside down.  I know the guy, Fossil Man, he had these weird reflective eye, snake eye glasses.  Yeah.  Kind of ridiculous.  But, what, you think I should have a gimmick?  I think the listeners should help us out, and we need a gimmick for you.  Something.  A gimmick.  Do you have to have part of your face exposed?  Like, what's the rule?  The Unabomber had the hood and the sunglasses, and he would lay his head down so you couldn't  even see any of his face. 
[01:02:30]  So, no, anything you want to wear, you know, that's your prerogative.  If you're going to sit there for upwards of 12, 15 hours playing cards, wearing something  ridiculous like that, you know, that's your prerogative.  But, uh...  Anthony has to have a gimmick.  I know what it is.  What?  You should dress up like a girl in a miniskirt and then not acknowledge it or mention it.  Get a little ribbon in your hair.  You don't act ironic about it.  You just play cards.  You think I should do that?  I absolutely do.  Anthony will never do that.  I know he won't, but I'm just hoping that it's funny, though.  Little Bo Peep blows to doing something like that. 
[01:03:00]  I don't know.  I was just going to, you know, go in there, probably, you know, the XM ONA plug hat if  I make, you know, TV or something, and then play it like that.  But if I should have a gimmick, like a ridiculous gimmick or a cool gimmick?  It's got to be...  I don't know.  We'll see what the listeners come up with.  They're pretty good at this stuff.  We need Anthony to have some kind of gimmick when he does this poker thing.  Two weeks from tomorrow, you'll be playing cards with a bunch of celebrities. 
[01:03:30]  Who else is playing in this thing?  Anyone know yet?  Yeah, we've got to get the list, but I think Shatner's in on it.  My buddy, Bill Shatner.  There's a couple...  I can't remember.  James Woods, usually in there.  You could dress as his cock.  You know, it's the usual suspects that you see every year.  At the Invitational.  Maybe Ben Affleck.  I'm not sure, but he's usually involved in these things.  And then, you know, poker superstars that if people are familiar with them on the air, 
[01:04:00]  on TV, you know who they are.  Well, it's going to be thrilling for me.  Believe me.  Let's go to the phones and see.  Later this week, we'll have a...  A lot of people are coming up with gimmicks for you, Anthony.  We have access to the phones today.  Let's say hi to Mark in Tennessee.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's happening, man?  Hey, I got the perfect gimmick for you, Anthony.  Check this out.  You know how you're talking about you have to sit there for like 12 to 15 hours, right?  Yeah.  Well, you should wear like a big cloth diaper and have the name Lil' Connor right across 
[01:04:30]  your chest.  That way, if you got to shit, you can shit.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Just go in the diaper and sit there in my own feces playing cards.  That sounds great.  Thank you for that tip.  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  Let's go to California.  Our listeners are creeps, by the way.  Of course they are.  Daniel, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  I hope you have been a lot of fun out there.  We know this sounds like crap, but we don't care.  We're just enjoying ourselves at Mardi Gras.  What's up?  Hey, first time caller.  I love your show.  Been a fan of the guy for a while. 
[01:05:00]  Thank you.  And not so much of a gimmick, but, you know, all of us truck drivers have been sending  these bull balls to you there, right, Anthony?  Why don't you take a set of bull balls and have them on the table with you?  That's a good look, John.  Those ridiculous bull balls that people put on their trailer hitch?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I'll do.  I'll put them on my chin.  How about that?  Great.  I'll be balls on the chin guy.  Oh, I know what you can do.  Yeah, Jimmy.  You can dress almost like you can have, like, a building motif, and you dress like a building, 
[01:05:30]  and on the front of it, you can write Stress Factory, and you can put a little sign by your  ear that says, Jim Norton, this weekend, 888-541-HA-HA.  You're the worst.  That sounds like a good gimmick.  That would be great.  You're the Stress Factory this weekend for Jim Norton.  While the other poker players are trying to dial the number to get tickets, I'll be raking  it in.  That's right.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jeremy in New York.  Jeremy, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I got a gimmick for Anthony.  Two red blue blockers.  Punch it out. 
[01:06:00]  Blue blockers, sunglasses.  Great.  All right.  We'll do a couple more here.  Bunch of asses.  Tony on Long Island.  What's up, Tony?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How you guys doing?  Good.  We're having a good time.  Hey, Anthony, you ever played any tournaments before?  No.  No tournaments.  All right.  Here's the tip, all right?  Because I've played in many.  You have to be conservative up front.  Yeah.  You have to be a very tight player up front.  That's how I play.  And start building a chip stack from that point on.  My friend, that's how I play. 
[01:06:30]  Then that's when you can start becoming a little bit more aggressive, or what they call  changing gears.  I'll sit back.  I'll be patient.  I'll play the nuts, and I'll, you know, I'm just going to...  It's not so much playing the nuts.  It's just, you know, picking and choosing depending on the position that you're in at that time  of the game.  You know, that's when you've got to make your move.  Like me, I love small connecting cards.  You know, if you're in late position, that's the kind of hand that you want.  Nobody's going to know it.  Yeah, but so how many tournaments have you played in? 
[01:07:00]  About 25 so far.  No, but as far as small connecting cards are concerned, a friend of mine was, like, playing  in a tournament, and he thinks that's the way to win.  No, Jimmy.  I don't want to hear it.  I'll have to ask Lou Ferrigno.  I'm sure the guy doesn't want to hear it.  I understand what you're saying.  All right, thank you.  I understand what you're saying.  I'm very patient.  I play very slow at the beginning of the game.  You know, not only does it let you feel everybody out, but like you said, you know, you slowly  build your stack up.  The worst thing you could do is try to just build it immediately and get that huge 
[01:07:30]  buffer right off the bat because it usually winds up going bad for you.  Just play it slow.  That's what I'm planning on doing.  I'm not going to be, you know, all in firsthand with a 7-2 off suited.  You know, I'm going to sit there and be patient and try.  Because, you know, my goal here is just to not be the first guy knocked out of the tournament.  You know what I mean?  I'm going to sit there, and I'm going to play it smart.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  So it's two weeks from tomorrow.  It's just an honor for me to sit with some of these poker superstars like that. 
[01:08:00]  Just like I said, if I could just sit there and play one good hand with one of these guys,  then, you know, a dream comes true.  All right.  Two weeks from tomorrow, we'll be broadcast live as Anthony is.  World Poker Tour.  I am more afraid than you than you do.  World Poker Tour.  I think you're going to be a little bit, because these guys are all great poker players,  but they don't know you.  That's true.  They've never played with you, so they don't know if you're bluffing or if you're an ass  or if you're a good player.  They have no idea.  I could be all three.  That's true.  I'm the bluffing ass.  You know what I do?  When a good card comes, I go, yes!  Yeah, that's what you've got to do.  The phones have exploded, so, I mean, if they're back in New York, 
[01:08:30]  if they could help us out with the comments and tell us what kind of gimmicks  they're suggesting for Anthony, that would help us a lot,  because there's like 20 phones running right now.  Gimmicks, sarcastic callers with their stupid gimmicks.  Well, Steve writes, have an interest like a 70s-style narc.  Oh, that would be interesting, with big pork chop sideburns and an afro.  You've got to be a 70s guy.  You really do have to do something.  Oh, that would only work if I got all the way up to the final table.  You'd be an ass if you dressed all weird and got thrown out.  You're like the first guy out. 
[01:09:00]  You've got to leave the casino all dressed like an idiot.  Instead of a celebrity, you're just another douche in the lobby.  Some dork.  All right, is Lou Ferrigno calling in or another guest that's going to blow us off?  At 4?  Ben, it's like 4.15.  No, it's, um...  No, it's not, Opie.  You're in the wrong time zone.  3.15.  What time zone are you in?  Oh, okay.  You've been screwed up for a while, haven't you?  I sure have.  I'm looking at the screen here going, wow, the show's going by fast.  No, Opie, there's plenty more show to do.  That's the New York time. 
[01:09:30]  Okay.  Well, we can talk about Letterman.  He had some funny stuff to say about the halftime show at the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Ben, you're still saying that the Pats are a dynasty at this point?  Absolutely.  Today was the parade up in Boston.  Today was the big parade.  Oh, today's the parade in Boston?  Yeah.  Big parade up in Boston today.  Anybody go to the parade?  You got any, uh...  I haven't, you know what, I haven't really addressed it.  Any deaths by beanbag guns from the Boston police, uh...  Hey, that's not nice.  What had happened?  That's not nice.  I'm just stating fact.  That girl went to my college.  No, that...  Maybe they were just trying to get the beanbag in her beer. 
[01:10:00]  Ben, what's the word on the street in Boston?  What do they say?  We're a dynasty.  We're the champions of baseball and football.  No, he said the word on the street in Boston.  I think it's, keep the colors where they belong, racist city.  I gotta say this for Boston, though, for the Patriots, who I don't like.  They're doing this in a time with salary caps, and it's much harder to win three out of four  with salary caps in place.  So I gotta give them credit for that.  It's a brutal time to be a dynasty.  Who is gonna bash the Pats?  Nobody.  There's no reason to.  They've done a great job.  I put them...  I kind of lined them up with the Cowboys of the early 90s. 
[01:10:30]  They kind of won the same way, you know, and then they kind of just held on to win  the last Super Bowl.  They're finished now, though.  They're gonna lose everyone.  Well, no, they're not.  Yeah, they are.  The Pats have everyone coming back next year.  No, they don't.  They have one unrestricted free agent.  No, they don't.  Joe Ambrosey.  Yes, they do.  Joe Ambrosey's the whole team.  You don't even know who he is.  I do so.  He's on the Patriots.  Yeah.  Jim's such a big football fan.  How many games you watched this year?  How many games you watched this year?  I'm gonna do my lady diving now.  I watched a couple.  I don't need to watch to be a fan.  If my team wins, I watch.  If I don't, I root for the Patriots. 
[01:11:00]  That's what a fan is.  Ben has been very low-key since the Super Bowl.  I'm just excited.  It's a dynasty.  Hungover.  Dynasty.  Well, you just answered the opposite of his question.  You said, Ben's been very excited since the Super Bowl.  And you're like, well, I'm just getting all...  Wait.  I've been mellow.  I've been enjoying myself.  I've been doing stuff.  I've been wandering around New Orleans.  Here's some...  Let's go to the audio.  Letterman talking about how he hates the halftime show at the Super Bowl.  And we'll be back for Mardi Gras.  Check this out.  Yesterday was a pretty good game, didn't you think?  And how about that halftime? 
[01:11:30]  Now, I won't lie to you.  When I was a kid, the most exciting thing that happened to me...  Well, the second most exciting thing that happened to me was the Beatles.  The Beatles.  And I think they, for most people in my generation, it changed their lives.  Of course.  And you know, and you loved John and Paul and George and Ringo.  You just loved them all.  And God bless Paul McCartney.  I'm not saying he's not a fantastic talent.  But I'll defer to you.  Was he singing to a track?  Was he lip-syncing that?  Did you see it yesterday?  Of course I saw it. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  I couldn't tell.  Yeah, I could tell.  You couldn't tell?  Yeah, it was absolutely a track.  Ah, you could tell he was lip-syncing.  Yes, he was not.  He might have been singing, but that's not what we were listening to.  We weren't hearing his actual live music.  I don't think so.  And by God, I'm saying, bring back nudity.  Well, really?  Yeah.  Nicely said.  I respect your right to say that.  Now here, and I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, but here's the deal.  Tremendous musical talent. 
[01:12:30]  A world icon.  And just all around terrific, wonderful person to have in the world of music.  Master showman?  Maybe not.  But other than that, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, well, you've got to admit, though, Drive My Car was rocking.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah, and like I was talking to somebody earlier before the show, Nancy backstage, and she says,  yeah, at one point he stood up and then he sat down.  Halftime, I mean, and granted, they had a tough act to follow after last year.  And that was awesome.  And I hope the NFL and the FCC and everybody rethinks their position about the halftime show. 
[01:13:00]  About halftime nudity.  Yeah, because if it wasn't Paul McCartney, it would just be an old guy singing.  No, no, no, no, but it was, but it was Paul McCartney.  Here's what you want to do with a halftime Super Bowl.  I mean, and by the way, they're trying to turn it into some quasi-religious, patriotic monument to the world.  Well, sometimes they've done that.  It's just, I don't get that.  It's a football game, play it in the afternoon, and then get drunk. 
[01:13:30]  That's what it is.  That's all it is.  On the air?  We're back in the air now?  All right, there we go.  There's Letterman talking about the Super Bowl, Anthony, and the halftime show.  Makes perfect sense.  You're back out on the balcony?  Yes, Opie, I am back out on the balcony.  We decided we were going to come out here.  I'm being kind of pelted with beads from the balcony across the way.  Are you?  Yeah, we decided we were going to come out here and finish the break from out on the balcony again. 
[01:14:00]  Is this loud enough?  I can't hear myself.  Yeah, it's a little low.  I think we need to be a little louder there.  You're ready, that's ready?  That's better.  There we go.  Wonderful.  Yep.  Oh, it's raining.  It's raining now, so a lot of people are trying to get out of the way of the rain.  Umbrellas are coming out.  Some chicks don't care.  They're now screeching with wet t-shirts.  A little lightning now.  Oh, that's smart.  We picked the perfect time to come back out here on the balcony.  That's fun. 
[01:14:30]  Just don't touch the metal, maybe.  Oh, that's not lightning.  That's people taking their picture over there.  Was it?  Yeah, I swear to God.  I thought it was lightning.  I was quite fearful.  It's just some of our freaky listeners.  The balcony across the way doesn't have a covering on it, so they all had to go in.  They bailed.  Bags.  It's going to turn into a wet t-shirt contest down there shortly.  Peg that umbrella.  Just take out that umbrella.  Nah, because it'll just bounce off.  I've got to start aiming for faces now.  There's no more open drinks, so we've just got to start hurting people.  That's the object now.  Just dark people.  Don't throw them to beads, Jaime. 
[01:15:00]  No.  Jaime's actually throwing the guy beads.  What are you doing?  Throw him a cup.  Beads are used to hurt.  Remember that.  Are those girls done with their paperwork anytime soon?  Are they still filling out paperwork?  This is ridiculous.  How retarded is it?  That it takes a half hour for the security detail to fill out paperwork.  I'm telling you, that just means one thing.  These girls are very, very hot, Anthony.  The longer it takes, the hotter the chips.  Yes, that's exactly.  Someone finally brought it to our attention.  That's what happens with Master Bo and the girls that come on our radio show. 
[01:15:30]  And are they going to be giving Jimmy a lap dance?  Is that what we're looking forward to?  I believe the next break we're going to go back inside and Jimmy will get a lap dance live on the show from some of the girls from the sister club of the crazy horse.  What do you call the gold?  I forgot because I have ADD.  The gold club or something?  Gold club, yes.  Gold club cabaret, right?  I hit that girl on the tits.  Oh, I hit her on the head.  You were going for her cleavage.  Oh.  Yeah.  She had really deep cleavage.  That was a very good shot, Jimmy.  You've got to explain that.  That was a long-distance shot.  You took out half her drink.  Now she's looking up. 
[01:16:00]  I just threw it across the street.  She wants to kill you.  Who cares?  There are some chicks that have, like, two feet long cleavage.  Big, fat, nasty cleavage.  I'm throwing this one, the Italian, the guinea beads.  It's a little quieter out now because the streets have cleared a little bit.  I like this better.  Ponchos have come out.  A lot of people are wearing their Southern Comfort ponchos.  Wow.  I'm really going to take out.  See that girl right there?  Let me try.  That could hurt her, though.  No, no, that's a tough shot.  That's a tough shot.  There you go.  Goodbye, drink.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Jimmy missed just to the right.  Little Catholic school-looking girl walking by.  Right there, see?  With their little black skirts.  Very nice.  That's a very nice look.  That's a dirty girl.  Filthy girl.  This guy's got a red cup in his hand.  Looks empty, though.  Yeah, that's kind of boring, too.  Damn it.  You've got to save the good beads for a good opportunity.  Well, where are the rest of our beads?  The sword's going to come back out, by the way.  This is just a quick little storm.  A quick little shower here at the Marduk Rock. 
[01:17:00]  What do you think?  The brother holding the...  Wow, he'll kill me.  Where?  Right there.  See this homie?  No, that guy will...  I think that guy's...  Look how scared we are of black people.  That guy is carrying...  I just don't throw it at black people.  At least you're honest about it.  I know.  See that guy right there?  Come on, Phil.  No, damn it.  Come on, Ant.  I'm looking for a good target.  These are very heavy beads, by the way, that I have.  We're looking down at the people.  We're trying to find the perfect opportunity for Anthony.  The perfect target.  A white girl.  Where? 
[01:17:30]  That's what I'm saying.  A white girl that's a very feeble.  This guy.  Goodbye.  Ah, shoot.  All right.  How about this one?  No, it's not open top.  No, no.  All right.  Oh, this guy right here.  The one that looks like Sly Stallone.  Yeah, that's a good one.  All right, here we go.  Ant's winding up.  Guy's right below us.  Oh, someone took the shot before me.  Someone took the shot before you, and now the guy's looking up, and you missed your opportunity,  Anthony.  He's all pissed.  Damn.  What little faggoty beads they give us.  Well, okay, this guy right here, right here.  Damn it.  Oh, you missed.  He was walking toward me. 
[01:18:00]  A tough shot.  Look at this girl.  She's got huge boobs.  Jesus.  She's completely topless, and the boobs are painted.  I don't know if that's painted like some kind of...  Oh, it's a butterfly.  The butterfly, and her titties are the wings.  I think Steve's getting a lot of video of all this stuff for FoundryMusic.com and OpieAndAnthony.com.  Those are huge utters.  Try to knock one of those boobs off her chest.  Oh, what a swab.  I don't know if that's attractive or not.  I can't...  No.  They're nice breasts, though.  Who's the old codger with her?  Probably her father. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  I'm getting that guy right there.  All right.  Look at that guy with the bald guy with the awful striped shirt.  He's moving.  Oh, dude.  I knew he was going to move.  You hesitated.  But I knew he was moving.  Right there.  This guy right here.  All right.  All right.  We got a bald guy.  Wow.  You got his arm.  I got his arm.  He just went and picked him up.  Picked him up out of the gut.  All right.  Hit him again.  Wow.  Look at these two girls.  The wet t-shirts are happening now.  Oh, yeah.  Too bad they're fours.  They're starting to get wet. 
[01:19:00]  And more girls in the Catholic schoolgirl outfits.  Oh, but they're middle-aged.  They look like the teachers.  It's not working as well when you're, I don't know, in your upper 40s.  Yeah.  That Catholic schoolgirl look doesn't work.  Yeah.  Okay.  Here's the deal, Anthony.  We got the two girls.  They got the paperwork done.  It's Chloe and...  Regan?  Regan?  Regan or Regan.  Whatever.  And I'm giving Jimmy a lap dance.  Chloe and the other one.  Oh, right here.  Right here.  Oh, right here.  Good.  Ah.  In his drink. 
[01:19:30]  I got in the guy's drink, but he held on.  That guy just got attacked.  He's got three rounds.  And he doesn't care.  Whoa.  Nice.  They're starting to throw him back.  That was...  I just saved you.  You know that, right?  No, I had a line on it.  You had a line on that?  Yeah.  Those are good heavy ones.  And here's the deal.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  When we come back, Norton is going to get a lap dance from Chloe and Regan or Regan, something  like that.  Yeah.  And it's the ONA Show.  We're live from Mardi Gras on Bourbon Street.  The Crazy Horse.  Take it in. 
[01:20:00]  That's the real deal.  Yeah!  That's what we do.  That's the real deal.  That's the shit.  That's the real deal.  Yeah!  That's what we do  That's the real deal  That's the shit 
[01:20:30]  Dance, motherfucker, dance  Dance, motherfucker, dance  Dance, motherfucker, dance  Dance, motherfucker, dance  I want to hear some music, man 
[01:21:00]  Shut, shut, shut, shut your face  I want to hear some music, man  I want to hear some music, man  Shut your face  I want to hear some music, man  Oh, oh, hey, terrific. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, hey, oh, hey.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
[01:22:00]  Get the fire to me  I'm clean and getting to me 
[01:22:30]  Get the fire to me  Take it in  I'm clean and getting to me  Get the fire to me  I'm clean and getting to me  Get the fire to me  That's the real deal  Yeah, that's what we do  That's the real deal  That's the shit  That's the real deal  That's what we do 
[01:23:00]  That's the real deal  That's the shit  That's the real deal  Yeah, that's what we do  That's the shit  I like you  I like you  We'll be right back. 
[01:23:30]  I don't see that.  On a show.  The O.P. and Anthony XM202. 
[01:24:00]  They can do it.  Oh, God damn.  Just starting to throw them back, Anthony.  Yeah, now I'm just throwing them in people's heads.  Here we go.  Whoa.  All right.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program live from Mardi Gras on Bourbon Street.  Actually, we're in the balcony of the crazy horse.  We went into today's program realizing that it's just going to be another clusterf,  so we're just going to have fun with this.  And they're setting up, I guess, the inside portion of the balcony for the lap dance  that Jimmy's going to get in a few minutes here from the sister club of the crazy horse. 
[01:24:30]  But in the meantime, it's starting to get a little uglier out here.  The sun is popping back out, by the way.  The rain shower is done.  We're throwing cups gingerly, and we're beaming people with the beads as well.  Yeah.  But they're starting to throw the beads back.  They are throwing back.  And they're not doing a good job, by the way.  No, no.  Here it comes again.  Watch out.  Come on.  Come on.  Nice shot, buddy.  Yeah, they're starting to throw the beads back at us,  which is exactly what we were hoping would happen. 
[01:25:00]  Come on.  Now it's an all-out bead war between us and our listeners.  It's going to get really dangerous.  It really is going to get ugly.  All right.  There you go.  Anyway.  Watch out for flying debris.  Is that guy dressed as Evil Knievel?  I believe so, yes.  Without the evil part.  Yeah.  Faggot Knievel.  Yeah, you notice that?  A lot of these people have these macho costumes, 
[01:25:30]  but there's nothing macho about them.  Faggots.  Right.  I got two words.  Faggot.  I see three Elvis down there.  Oh, that guy could cause a problem.  That guy is not happy.  He just took a header.  With a bunch of beads.  Yeah.  Jimmy?  What?  Hi, how are you, buddy?  Good.  I can't hear anything you're saying.  I don't have my...  Basically, what's happening out here.  Yeah, Jimmy was inside because we were getting ready for the lap dance.  They're starting to throw the beads back at us.  I just smashed some guy in the head with a nice pair of five-pounders. 
[01:26:00]  That was you who took out that guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's not happy.  He's not happy at all.  Okay, I can hear now.  How are the girls inside?  Are they hot?  Really hot.  I only looked at them for a second because I ran a tinkle,  but they looked very, very attractive.  You want to be all prepared for your lap dance.  You don't want any bladder pressure.  Yeah.  Yeah, I understand.  Unfortunately, I'm packing a half, though.  I really wish I had known this was happening.  I would have restrained myself twice last night.  Well, like that matters to Jimmy.  Well, for me, it would have, you know, just a nice firm.  Crap three times.  And once again, the music is starting to get louder across the way. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, I see a giant pepper walking down the street for some ridiculous reason.  And it looks like the giant pepper has fallen a few times.  You see that?  Yeah, it's full of mud and gutter sleeves.  That just missed you, Jimmy.  I know.  He was trying for Jimmy.  He was definitely gunning for Norton.  These guys are definitely getting more aggressive.  Oh, come on.  Let's see what you got.  He's winding up.  He's winding up and spin.  Nice toss, actually.  Wow.  Oh, this could do some damage. 
[01:27:00]  I just noticed.  I don't want to let them on to this, but if one person throws as a distraction, another  person can throw and wail us really good because we're distracted looking at the one set of  beads.  Yeah.  So we got to really be careful.  Got to watch each other's backs.  Yep.  Overlapping field of fire.  All right, let's save these.  This is going to be a nice weapon later.  This is like the sniper scene with a full metal jacket.  The naked lady beads.  We'll place them right there for later.  Those are good, yeah.  That'll really hurt.  Yeah, look for a baby carriage.  Like Ben throwing it at infants. 
[01:27:30]  Wonderful.  All right, why don't we go back inside and get the lap dance done for Jimmy.  All right.  Oh, wait.  Look, titties.  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Never mind.  They weren't that good?  Oh, they were awful.  Gravy stains.  It looked like they could have been pretty good.  Watch out, Jimmy.  No.  That's why I said look because she looked like she wouldn't have been that bad, but they were  really awful.  All right, we're going back inside.  Jimmy's making his way inside.  We've got two girls that are going to give Jimmy a very nice lap dance live on the program.  Steve, are you tape?  Steve's going to tape the lap dance for foundrymusic.com and opianathlete.com. 
[01:28:00]  I noticed this occasion is really for a lot of older women that, like, once a year can  come out and show their boobs because no one asks them to all year long.  Right.  So this is like they're coming out.  And the other thing, you know, most of the boobs, I'd have to say 95% of the boobs from  a balcony look really good.  Ooh, really?  Well, because you're looking down on them.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You can't see that gravity's taking its toll and stuff from above for some reason.  Yeah, that's true.  Except that you have noticed the two to three foot cleavage from time to time. 
[01:28:30]  Big, long, nasty cleavage.  Look at this.  From behind, these girls in the Catholic schoolgirl outfits look like they could be  really hot, right?  Yep.  They turn around.  They're like middle-aged women.  Look at this lady.  Yeah.  She's got to be 55 years old.  Oh, here you go.  And then look at the guy that she's with.  He's dressed as a teacher.  He's got a ruler in his pocket and a pocket protector.  Ugh.  That was really creepy.  All right.  I hear Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're all sitting there?  Oh, yeah, man.  I'm sitting here right by the couch and just really waiting for my lap dance very eagerly. 
[01:29:00]  Okay.  We're going to make our way back in.  Jimmy, just start babbling.  We'll be in there in a second.  Well, the chicks are here.  I haven't met them, but I've kind of seen them, and they are really attractive.  Yeah, I'm going to have to snag a look at them.  Yeah, really hot.  They're wearing civilian clothes, though, so I'm hoping they put on something like maybe  panties or something a bit more revealing.  Well, their regular clothes have to come off, I believe.  Yeah, I would hope so.  I'm going to come running in there.  All right, we'll hold the force.  All right, I'm all set.  I'm in perfect position to check out this lap dance. 
[01:29:30]  Mardi Gras really is a chance for fat, ugly pigs to feel like attractive girls.  Like, they now know what it feels like to be ogled and to be wanted, and it's really  like a place for awful people.  Yeah, they have no problem showing, you know, their boobs, their pussy at times.  You know, they're all horrid, the middle-aged women.  You notice that, Anthony?  Oh, they love it.  That's what I was saying.  It's like this is their one time a year to come out.  Why is this wet?  Ew.  Why is the couch wet?  Is it wet?  Ah, water was...  Feel it.  Is it wet or no? 
[01:30:00]  Just sit down.  No, it's not wet.  What is the matter with you?  I don't know.  I thought it was wet.  You're absolutely insane.  I really am a weirdo.  It's the driest couch ever.  Oh, hi, Anthony.  Maybe it was, you know, used or something.  Three men just sitting on the couch talking.  Ah!  All right, Ben's picking up a microphone.  So, Ben, what's going on here?  We have some ladies.  They're going to be at the Gold Club.  It starts tomorrow night.  It's the G-String Awards.  Of course it is.  It's a four-day event, right?  At the Gold Club Cabaret.  The Gold Club's great.  We went there the other night.  This place, Steve fell asleep.  Great club.  The sister club of this place. 
[01:30:30]  It's a rousing endorsement.  No, no, no.  Steve was there.  He fell asleep.  But we all understand Steve.  After about 500 drinks.  So, Steve and I, we've got a couple girls here.  They want to dance for Jim.  Welcome, Jim, to New Orleans.  Oh, it's very nice.  Are you?  Do we have any music for the girls?  Because most of these girls need the music to do their lap dances, too.  Yeah, something we didn't think of.  Yeah.  Well, I can play some music and put some headphones on them.  That's going to be awkward.  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  No, maybe very low. 
[01:31:00]  We can play music from back there.  The girls can just dance.  There's music outside.  You know what?  They're pros.  They'll figure it out.  Yeah.  They'll figure it out.  If they can hide their revulsion from my fat stomach, they can certainly pretend there's  music playing.  Let's bring the girls in.  They're not going to be able to hear us because it's so loud.  We've got to say that again, Anthony.  We all have headphones on.  That's the only way we're able to communicate with each other.  Ben and Steve, they're like three feet away from us.  They have no idea what we're saying unless they have their headphones on.  Put my sunglasses over there, sweet angel, if you don't mind.  Oh, thanks a mil, Ben.  Thanks a mil.  All right.  Bring in the girls. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, here they come into our little cubicle area.  Oh, hi.  Hello.  Too beautiful.  You're lovely girls.  She's looking at the mic like she's never seen one before.  I know.  This is going to be interesting.  Jesus.  You talk into it.  Words transfer to someplace else.  Oh, boy.  Oh, hi.  Hi, I'm Chloe Love.  Chloe?  You're Chloe?  Wait, hold on.  That's Jimmy.  I'm Jim.  Hi, Jim.  Hi, nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  She's very lovely.

He's going to film this for FoundryMusic.com and OpieAndAnthony.com.  We brought you presents.  You brought us presents?  Porn.  Porn.  Porn.  Porn.  That's great.  Are these?  Of course, since we're getting one of your guys' stickers, you have to get ours.  You get the Chloe Loves Me.  Your guys'.  And you also get, exotic dancing is not a crime. 
[01:32:30]  That's true.  But choking her for teasing you after is.  They can't hear.  They can't hear.  Thank you, sweetheart.  Are either of you in any of these features?  I am, yeah.  You are.  Which one?  Both?  Both.  Which one?  That's me and my cover.  This hardcore is you.  Is this hardcore?  It's hardcore, but lots of tease.  You know, get your dick hard.  Really?  All right.  Well, we'll see what you can do live.  If you guys are speaking around, I'll bring you my porn.  It's really hardcore.  Oh, hardcore.  Oh, what kind of porn did you do?  I mean, what kind?  What kind of porn?  I do girls and guys. 
[01:33:00]  I'm a hardcore porn.  Oh, you have any with you?  I've done about ten so far.  Who have you shot with?  What companies?  VCA.  Okay.  Actually, Mike South.  He works for Hollywood Video and one with Wicked.  And what are you known for in your pornos?  Anything special?  What's your specialty?  Yes, my oral skills.  Your oral skills.  What makes your oral skills better than most?  You know what?  I don't know, but everybody says I have a little tongue trick that I do.  Yeah?  Oh.  How about that?  Very nice.  I'm in conjunction with Playboy.  Oh, cool.  I work with Playboy. 
[01:33:30]  So yours are not really hardcore, but hers is vivid and wicked.  They won't let me do hardcore right now because of all the Playboy stuff I've been doing.  Understandable.  Wow.  Are you guys coming to the G-Strings?  The G-String Company.  What is it called again?  The G-String Awards.  Awards?  What is the G-String Awards?  That's me.  You're looking at me.  You're beautiful.  I mean, you're beautiful in person, too.  What is it, though?  What's the competition?  Just dancing?  I can't hear you.  I'm sorry.  What is the G-String Awards all about?  Is it a...  It's...  It's... 
[01:34:00]  Now it's become, you know, one of the best competitions in the industry.  It's the best of the best of the best are only invited.  It's four categories.  It's porn, showgirl, magazine, and...  Is it three or four categories?  It's three.  It's porn, showgirl, and magazine.  Oh, it's mackerel.  I'll say.  Yeah, so, um...  It, uh...  It...  Like, the elite of the elite come to our contest and...  And show off their wares. 
[01:34:30]  And show off their wares.  This is not the first year, is it?  No, no.  This is the fifth year.  Because my buddy went to it one time, and I'm like, dude, how hot are the chicks?  And he said, you wouldn't believe...  Yeah, we're pretty hot.  Hold on.  Can Ben move your arms so I can see her breasts?  Oh!  Wow, wait.  Wow, lovely.  Wow, very nice.  Goodness.  Are you guys coming?  Yeah, now we're coming.  Absolutely.  That's wonderful.  Can I watch?  You girls want to dance for Jimmy?  Well, we had planned on it.  That would be very lovely.  We have some music ready if you want it. 
[01:35:00]  All right.  Let me step...  I'll step over here.  Where are you going, sweetie?  Well, I want to give Jimmy room.  Yeah, we...  All right.  We're true friends, Jimmy.  I'm going to take this off now, because we're going to take our top off.  We're going to give you the whole couch here.  Hold on a minute.  We're getting off the couch.  You girls just go nuts, all right?  Anthony and I will try to describe what's going on.  Can you guys do this without music, though?  Well, there's a good guy.  All right.  You can hear the music?  Yeah, they can hear it.  Can I leave my headphones on?  All right.  Anthony, two really hot blondes.  They've got the wife beater t-shirts on and jeans and little sneakers.  They're coming off.  I know they're coming off.  Oh, yeah, they go.  And the wife beaters are coming off, Anthony. 
[01:35:30]  The one girl is topless.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  She's got lovely breasted.  Oh, there we go.  Really lovely girl.  All right.  They're both topless at this point.  What's that, ma'am?  Spread the legs.  Spread the legs.  Be comfortable.  Do you know the drill?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Can we...  I know.  I'm fine.  Here, Ben.  I'll be an on-the-field reporter here.  Holy Toledo.  Can I take these stupid headphones off?  Here.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, I'll mic you.  I got the wireless mic, Jimmy, if we need you.  There we go.  All right.  Slouch.  We've got to be able to get to your toys. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, see, he's slouching in the couch, so he's...  All right, you ready?  He's very relaxed.  Oh, wow.  One of the girls now pushing her breast into Jimmy's face.  Jimmy's whole head is disappearing in between cleavage.  You know what I noticed?  Jimmy's not really breathing, though.  He's just kind of like holding his breath as the boobs are just being rubbed up and around  his nose and his eyes.  He's going for a kiss.  He's sneaking, stealing a kiss on the girl's shoulder.  Now, the other girl's straddling Jimmy. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, dry hump in Jimmy's crotch area with her ass.  Huh?  He's got a chubby.  He does have a chubby?  Because he was complaining.  Don't talk about his gut.  He's trying to enjoy himself.  He was complaining that he didn't think...  No, I don't think it's his gut.  You feel it, right?  Yeah, it's a chubby.  Yeah, because he whacked off three times last night.  He didn't think he could get a chubby for you girls.  Can you go three times with a girl?  Probably, yeah.  I mean, but last night I was just so lonely and annoyed at myself, I had to just scrap  on my computer three times.  You're coming home with me, then.  All right.  Oh.  You can hardly feel it. 
[01:37:00]  It's nothing there, really.  Oh.  How come you're both wearing jeans?  Don't worry about it.  Wow.  That'll change in a minute.  Switch positions.  Now, uh...  Does he have a chubby?  He does, actually.  I can feel it in there.  And is it a good chubby, or what?  Yeah, it's good enough for anal.  Hey, Anthony, there's something you don't hear every night about that.  It's good enough for anal.  Jimmy, let me try to get a mic in there.  Well, she gave it a good description.  It's good enough for anal.  That's actually a bumper sticker I'll be selling at my shows.  Are you ready for a butt view? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, I thought you would be fantastic.  Oh, I'd love that.  They're taking a slight break so they can get their jeans off.  Jimmy, what do you think so far?  They're two of the hottest chicks I've ever seen.  They're fantastic.  Two really hot blondes.  They're showing the brown eye right now.  Can I see that promise?  I wish I'm sure it's nice.  Why do you hate it?  I don't like it.  Why?  It's like not round enough.  When you say it, you've done hardcore porn.  You've been naked before.  Guys, I'm not going to be rude.  Yeah, Jimmy's negotiating, but the one girl doesn't want to take her jeans off, Anthony.  I have a feeling it might be, uh...  Oh, do you think it's on time?  Yeah, I think she's just coming up with an excuse. 
[01:38:00]  Anytime there's a girl or two in there, one of them has to, yeah.  Hey, what are you doing to that other girl there?  We have to describe for the radio.  Um, I'm being naughty.  She's being naughty, Anthony.  She's rubbing her jeans.  Well, she's, um...  She just went south.  Jimmy, you have a very good viewpoint there.  What's going on?  Well, the one girl is doing exactly what I'd like to be doing to the other girl.  Yeah.  She's really sexy.  I really enjoy this.  Do you enjoy that?  I do.  I love having oil done. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, that seemed to be a little ticklish, Anthony.  A little tickle.  Okay, are the jeans coming off now, or is that more of a tease thing today?  Oh, it's very sexy.  All right.  Yeah, I won't take them off.  All right, there you go.  Jimmy, what do you think?  There's the bus.  Oh, does she have a great, uh...  Oh, she's sexy.  Just say it.  Her lips are so sexy, yeah.  You just saw the lips from behind?  Is it not?  Yours aren't pierced?  Thank you.  Pierced?  Look, I'll show you a piercing.  Jimmy, she wants to show you her piercing. 
[01:39:00]  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Look at...  Can you pull them down?  I won't touch.  I just want to see.  I don't care.  I can't be...  Why showered?  Oh, my God.  They haven't shaved today, Anthony.  Wow.  How hot is that?  What do you think?  One is shaved, one is not.  That's amazing.  So, so attractive.  This is really, really frustrating.  That's wonderful.  Very sexy girls.  Uh, ladies, see if his chubby's, uh, doing a little better.  Is his chubby still...  Yep, his chubby's still there.  Still...  Is it getting better, or... 
[01:39:30]  Huh?  Is his chubby getting better?  Uh, we could do more with him, but...  We'd have to take him home.  What?  They want to take you home.  I would like that a lot.  Don't tease, because he'll leave the broadcast.  I will walk off this dumb radio show in 30 seconds.  He will leave right now.  I'll take my own flight back.  I'll fly US Air, and I'll stay on the wing.  You know, we got our car here.  You just go back with us.  Do you have your car?  Yeah, and I'm driving.  I would actually let Tom...  I would sit on Tom's lap on a motorcycle right now to go home with these two.  And I'd put my nose in his mouth so we could breathe through it. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Very nice.  All right, Jimmy, grab that microphone.  Very nice.  That was a nice lap dance, huh?  Yes.  Chloe and Reagan.  Chloe and Reagan from...  What films can people see you in?  What films can people see you in?  Angels of the South, Melted Pink, and Blowjob Girls 2.  Blowjob Girls 2.  I love the title.  Melted Pink, Anthony.  That's great.  What's the plot of Melted Pink? 
[01:40:30]  Don't know.  No?  She doesn't know.  Don't know.  Just come in, do your part.  Yeah, exactly.  Let them cut it, edit.  We start tomorrow with the contest.  Okay.  And it goes through Saturday.  Come and see us.  I believe it starts about 8.30 or 9.  Right.  So there's going to be a lot of hot girls, a lot of porn stars, a lot of showgirls, a  lot of magazine girls that you've seen in some of the magazines out there.  Magazine girls.  And I'm going to be guest starring.  I am Miss G-String Universe for the rest of the week, so I hand down my title. 
[01:41:00]  All right.  It's the G-String Awards, Anthony, at the Gold Club Cabaret here in New Orleans.  What's the address?  It's on...  It's on Iberville.  Iberville Street, 727 Iberville Street in New Orleans.  Yeah, it's right across from the Oyster Company.  All right.  Very nice.  Okay.  Really nice girl.  Wow.  Let's hear it for the girls.  Really hot.  Very sexy.  Absolutely beautiful.  You wanted to go back outside and throw some beads, Anthony?  Sure.  Yeah, we'll do a little more of that, I guess.  Oh.  I'm going to love, dude. 
[01:41:30]  Hold on.  We've got a very important caller on the phone here that wants to say hi.  Let's go to this here.  And say hi to...  Who?  You know I'm a buzzkill.  You know that.  Oh, no.  Just...  You know how hot...  What's a buzzkill?  Oh, God damn it.  We just had a hot girl on our palate, and you're washing it off with this dog crap.  I'm just asking, you know, how you join the Mardi Gras, that's all.  How do you join the Mardi Gras?  Yeah, how?  Lady Di, you would fit in perfect down here. 
[01:42:00]  Yep.  It's the land of the raging alcoholics.  You would lead the parade down here.  Oh, she could be the float.  If I ever went to New Orleans, I would definitely go over there.  And you wouldn't come back alive.  Well, I don't know about that.  Every day is Mardi Gras for you.  You're drunk.  No.  So, do you get a job?  You got a job yet?  Actually, I'm going right now, I'm going to classes to get a job.  Classes to get a job.  Here's the new thing.  What classes are you taking to get a job?  Well, you know, what happens is I have to go over to a place, and I have to be there at 9 o'clock, 
[01:42:30]  and we have to be there until about at least 11, 30, 12 o'clock.  And they're giving us classes on, you know, how to get a job and everything like that, you know, whatever, whatever.  What type of job are they giving you classes to get?  Well, whatever's available for me.  So, instead of filling out applications and interviewing at places, you're going to a class?  No, no, no, no.  They send you to places to put in an application.  And where is this school?  It's in New Jersey. 
[01:43:00]  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  All right, yeah, you know, the listeners are calling like crazy, and they're saying,  please get rid of the cooler.  Oh, what?  They're saying that we're having a really good show and to just get rid of the cooler.  So, let's get rid of Lady Di.  Thanks, Lady Di, for adding nothing to the show once again.  What a complete disaster she is.  All right, we've got to get back out on the balcony so we can throw some more beads.  We've got Lou Ferrigno.  He's checking into the program in about 15 or 20 minutes.  Ooh.  We also need to do a Vermont teddy bear spot before break.  Oh, thank you, Ben.  Oh, we could do that.  Hey, could one of you girls do like a fake orgasm as we get our microphones back out outside on the balcony? 
[01:43:30]  Would you mind doing that, Chloe?  All right, give Chloe the wireless mic, and as we situate ourselves back out on the balcony,  she's going to do a really good fake orgasm, right?  All right.  Now, you know what we want.  We kind of want the slow build into a dough and then, you know, finish up.  I can do that.  Great.  Let's see the acting ability, and we need it to be long enough so we can get out on the balcony.  Okay.  All right, let her rock. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Do it, Jimmy. 
[01:44:30]  Ew.  That's the spot.  I don't want to hear Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:45:00]  I don't think it's that good.  Oh, yeah.  She's a lot louder than she sounds.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh.  Well, Anthony, speaking of love.  Oh, baby.  Yes.  Oh, right there.  Valentine's Day right around the corner.  Yes, it is, Opie.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Look at Ben freaking out.  Oh.  Valentine's Day right around the corner.  She can keep moaning.  Relax.  Oh, yeah.  Ben's trying to produce a professional radio show here.  What is he, insane?  Yeah.  Let her moan through the whole read. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Valentine's Day around the corner, and, you know, the guy's looking for something different this year, right?  Something a little special you might want to get your loved one.  Don't get the same old boring flowers and chalk, but be original this year.  Oh, yeah.  Send your wife or girlfriend something with the personality of the Monsetri bear.  Oh, yeah.  That's what it is.  They got every kind of bear you can imagine for a couple of your personality.  Oh, yeah.  The lover boy bear.  It's a heart-shaped love tattoo.  Oh, yeah.  And then the gangster love, the heartthrob bear wearing boxer shorts, or the mysterious love bandit.  They even have a brand-new, officially licensed Playboy bear with a smoking jacket and martini glass. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, yeah.  Sounds like she's enjoying this.  Can I just add, guys, if you get your lady a Vermont teddy bear, this is what's going to come from your bedroom.  You'll hear this.  Right.  The best of all is think of you every time she hugs her bear.  Shop at Vermont teddybear.com or call one of our friendly bear counselors at 1-800-829-BAR. 
[01:46:30]  They'll deliver it with free chocolate, a gift card in their famous box.  Anthony, you didn't mention some of the bears that the guys could get.  Oh, I certainly did.  Oh, you did?  I was too busy listening to the moaning.  Well, if you're...  Oh, yeah! Right there!  The romantic, the open bear, the Romeo bear,  where you can tailor the bear to their hobby or occupation,  the heart racer bear for racing fans,  or the love-handled bear dressed like a trucker.  You know, we've got a lot of truckers out there.  Perhaps that would be the one. 
[01:47:00]  For about the practice of the roses,  the only bear is handmade in America and guaranteed for life.  Send a bear to the office.  When it arrives, you should be completely surprised.  All of our co-workers are going to think you've got the greatest guy.  This is your thing.  Oh, until you missed it.  Yeah!  Oh, yeah!  This is the best Valentine's Day ever. 
[01:47:30]  With a gift she'll really love and always remember.  Call 1-800-829-BEAR or shop online at vermontteddybear.com.  Overnight and Valentine's Day delivery is guaranteed.  Oh!  Look how happy that makes everybody.  1-800-829-BEAR.  That's 1-800-829-BEAR.  Yeah, baby!  Yeah!  Yeah, baby!  Vermont Teddy Bear.  And if you do call 1-800-829-BEAR,  tell them Opie and Anthony sent you. 
[01:48:00]  Very nice.  Thank you to Chloe for helping us out with that luxury.  Jesus!  All right, we're back on the balcony of the crazy horse.  Yeah.  Who's the Paris Hilton-looking girl that just...  Where's that?  Just came up here on the balcony.  Looks just like Paris Hilton, no?  They're saying yes, yes, yes.  Your brother's hysterical, Opie.  Huh.  Brett hit a girl's beer.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, and knocked it completely out of her hand, got beer all over her.  And she looked so sad, and I think she was a fan of the show, that Brett then threw her down five bucks to buy her a new beer. 
[01:48:30]  No kidding, really?  Yeah, he's a softie.  My brother is the softie in my family, by the way.  He's a softie.  Thank you, baby.  All right.  Yeah, we're getting reloaded.  Our beads are getting reloaded here.  We got more of these Opie and Anthony beer mugs we're tossing down.  They're a hit.  They're a hit to the people down on Bourbon Street, Anthony.  Yes, they are.  Okay.  Speaking of hitting people on Bourbon Street, I have a new supply of beads and a whole new crew walking by with their exposed drinks. 
[01:49:00]  I need a...  Why haven't I gotten another Bloody Mary?  Well, I don't know.  Where's Club Soda Kenny?  Club Soda Kenny!  Kenny!  Kenny's too busy watching another girl dance.  Kenny!  There's like three or four other girls out here on the balcony just kind of doing like dances now.  Club Soda Kenny.  Give that to Club Soda Kenny.  Kenny.  No, give him the headphones.  Give Kenny the headphones.  Kenny.  Kenny, perhaps instead of watching Paris Hilton over there, whatever her name is, 
[01:49:30]  perhaps you could look and be a little more attentive to the boys' needs?  No, she's trying to weasel her way over here.  Oh, she is?  Yeah.  Oh, is that what she was doing?  Yeah.  Who is she?  Yeah.  You're keeping attractive girls away from us.  By looking at their asses?  Believe me, she's nothing to look at.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't have a good view from here.  Well, I've had a better look.  She kind of looks like Paris Hilton on Crack.  Crack, yeah.  On Crack?  Yeah, with the scabs.  Is that a good thing? 
[01:50:00]  You know, that's why they keep the lights down low in these strip clubs.  I understand.  Now, thank you, Kenny, for protecting us.  Yeah, the lights are turned down to cover up a world of hurt.  Kenny, is there anyone that could get me Bloody Mary?  Whatever you would like, it would be my pleasure.  Thank you, sir.  Bloody Mary, Mr. O, anything?  We haven't had a joke from Kenny either all day.  Yeah, you got today's joke?  You got a joke?  I'll tell you, I'm absolutely frazzled.  You don't know how many fans are trying to crash this party.  Really? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He is working hard.  A lot of people trying to come up and he's keeping them away.  Yeah, they're just trying to crash the party and I got my hands full with that.  I noticed something.  Kenny's working really hard to protect us, right?  And Master Poe is working very hard to pick up our listeners.  Yeah, Master Poe is probably the one inviting people up that Kenny then has to throw out.  Who?  Master Denny Terrio?  Denny Terrio.  The Hispanic Denny Terrio.  He's doing dance fever on the street.  He's doing splits in the middle of Bourbon Street right into the slime and puke. 
[01:51:00]  He's got slimy crotch from doing his splits.  By the way, I think we really did lose Jim Norton for the day.  Oh, he doesn't care about the show anymore.  He's now wrapped around two girls.  Just to come over here, I almost slipped in his puddle of clear stuff.  Oh, that's Jimny's.  You could skate on it like Hans Christian Andersen.  It's amazing.  All right, here.  I'm going to get you Bloody Mary now.  Think up a joke on your way back up.  I hear you.  No, no, you've got a joke.  Give us a joke.  You've got one right now? 
[01:51:30]  I was taking the pressure off him saying, you know, he could think it over on his way.  I've got to think.  When I come back, I promise you.  Come back with Anthony's drink and have a joke.  Meanwhile, Jimmy is the probably take of the scabby Paris Hilton.  All right, Jimmy has just given up on the show.  He's like, screw this.  He came back.  He almost put the headphones on.  He saw another girl and ran away.  And he just left us.  Here he comes.  Hey, Jimmy.  He's coming back.  Watch.  He's going to say that she's really hot, and we already decide that she's not hot.  Watch.  No.  Watch this.  Watch this.  What's up, Jim? 
[01:52:00]  What's up, dude?  I really want one from that girl.  She's sexy.  Which one?  This one right here with the blonde hair.  The one that kind of looks like Paris Hilton?  Yeah.  Yeah, we thought we were going to see her.  I want a lap dance from that one.  Anthony and I were saying we thought she's the hottest girl here.  Yeah.  Oh, thanks, Kenny.  I really want a lap dance from that.  I'll do it.  I'll pay her for it in the air.  Of course you will.  I think that's what she does.  What do you like about her?  She's got a great body.  She's very skinny.  And, yeah, and she has, like, her panties look like really, like, they hug her very nicely.  Oh, you like that? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Like, her midsection is very, like, there's zero body fat.  Yeah, we definitely want her.  She's got the body of a crack whore.  You don't mind the scabs and stuff on her arms?  No, please.  If she doesn't have them now, she will when she's done with me.  Yeah, we definitely.  All right.  She's so stupid.  I definitely want that one right there, though.  That's not like Paris Hilton.  She's more like Newark Hilton.  She's showing her rump to the people down on Bourbon Street.  Panties on?  I don't know.  Lift that up for a second.  Lift it up.  We can't see.  If you have panties on, lift up the little tiny skirt. 
[01:53:00]  Lift up the back of your skirt.  And...  Oh!  Wow, there's a lot of hurt there, Anthony.  I want to dance from her.  There's a lot of pimples.  Wow, it looks like she's got shot with a BB gun a few times in the end.  I don't care.  I definitely like her.  I think she ran out of veins to shoot up in.  She's shooting directly into her butt cheek.  Something's going on there.  Well, I mean, it is just getting completely out of hand  on Bourbon Street now, man.  Completely out of hand.  Yeah, very wet. 
[01:53:30]  Very disgusting.  Look at the gutters now.  They're ten times builtier than when we got...  Ah!  This guy just got hit in the head with beads.  Yeah, but that's one of our listeners.  He's already on to us, so...  He's having fun.  You notice another observation here, Anthony?  Yeah.  There's balconies across the way, pretty much all over the place, obviously,  up and down Bourbon Street.  We're the only part of Bourbon Street that has not many people in front of us.

[02:22:30]  Yeah, this guy.  I'm just tilting him.  This guy will not give up.  He just keeps picking up beads, and he keeps throwing them.  Watch this guy.  Keeps throwing them back up at us.  Whoa!  Oh, okay.  Now they're throwing a full bill up at us.  Wow.  I just got showered by that beer.  Jeff and Pittsburgh, what's up?  Now they're throwing full beers.  What's up, Jeff?  I have a good one.  Give me a minute.  No, we don't have Jeff.  Where's Jeff?  That guy and his fat girlfriend threw up a full beer.  Which guy?  The beer might have taken out the phone system. 
[02:23:00]  Okay.  Thank you for that.  There's some angry, angry...  We made some real friends here today.  Now they're pelting us with beer.  He threw a full beer can up.  I wish it would have went through the window.  I've got to give up on the phones, because it just got showered with beer.  Oh, now it won't work?  Sorry about that, Jaime.  Yeah, I can't answer phones anymore.  That's because we're making friends.  Give me the Vermont teddy bear spot.  I'll be right back.  Anthony, Valentine's Day... 
[02:23:30]  Where are you going, Jimmy?  Where are you going?  Jimmy?  You can't just say I'll be right back without telling us where you're going.  What's that?  Where are you going?  Well, you were going to do the live read.  And you're going to go negotiate a little more?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right, Jimmy's out, Anthony.  It's the Vermont teddy bear.  Cover me when I read, and I'll cover you when you read, okay?  All right, deal, deal.  Oh, you want me to go first?  Yeah.  I don't want to look down.  All right, cover me, though.  I don't want to get hit while I'm reading. 
[02:24:00]  Okay, I'm watching out for you.  Valentine's Day is right around the corner.

[02:24:30]  And if you're more romantic, send the Cupid bear or the Romeo bear.  They have bears for hobbies or occupations, like the heart racer bear for racing fans with a love handle bear.  Dressed like a trucker.  Best of all, she'll think of you every time she hugs her little bear.  Oh, you want me?  Okay.  I'm covering you.  All right, thank you.  Club Soda Kenny's here, too.

[02:25:30]  They're really starting to throw the beads like crazy here.  You know what I'm saying?  There's an old codger, this old curmudgeon, that's throwing beads back up at everybody here on the balcony.  And your brother just grabbed a handful of beads, and as hard as he could, threw them right at his head.  Like, he's not taking any guff.  All right, there you have it.  The Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Tell them Opie and Anthony sent you if you call 1-800-829-BEAR.  All right, let me try the phones again, Jaime.  It's amazing.  Jimmy's feeling the itch.  You know that.  Yeah.  Wait, wait. 
[02:26:00]  He's done with the program.  You want a Jimmy update?  Yeah, Jimmy update.  Yeah, what's going on?  Club Soda County, yes.  I think he's spending some cash as we speak.  As we speak.  During the show, he decided he's going to get some.  You know he's got no willpower.  Now, here's the deal with Jimmy.  I mean, he is a sex addict, and when he gets the urge, he will put everything online.  Yeah.  He doesn't care.  He'll walk off the radio show, and he'll take care of the itch, and then he'll be back,  and then he'll be able to enjoy the rest of the radio program, and then he'll be able  to enjoy the rest of the night. 
[02:26:30]  We understand.  When he gets the addiction in his blood, he can't help himself, and he's off taking care  of business.  Yeah.  Can you go with the Paris Hilton girl?  The ugly Paris Hilton, yeah.  The Paris Hilton on Crack Girl?  Yeah.  Paris Econowodge.  Yeah.  I understand him, though.  If we would tell him to stay here instead of do that, he'd be totally worthless to the  show, because his mind is just completely taken with getting sex.  Yeah.  There's no way we could talk about it.  Yeah.  No way whatsoever.  He went downstairs during the last break to see if she was dancing, and then he's like, 
[02:27:00]  can you time out that live read for about six or seven minutes so I can go down when  she gets off the stage?  So that's what he did.  He's a sex addict, is what he is.  Everyone knows he's got that addictive personality.  He can't do any type of drugs or booze anymore because he's just too addictive, and sex  is the one thing he hasn't sworn off.  Yeah.  And now, like anyone else that's addicted to something, it doesn't matter, work, something  like that, he's off now trying to get sex. 
[02:27:30]  Because I was amazed that he went out to dinner with us last night, but he said, you know,  he took care of business in one of these strip clubs, and he said he was able to relax  and just hang, and I saw that.  That's what it is.  It's just a matter of releasing for him, and the girl doesn't even have to be, she has  to barely be there.  Yeah.  As long as he's got his hand, he's a happy man.  What are the odds that XM will allow us to go back on the road after this broadcast?  Not to Mardi Gras, that's for sure.  We did, what else did we do remotes from?  Where else have we been? 
[02:28:00]  Vegas.  Vegas was fine, see?  Vegas was good, and we're going to be in Los Angeles two weeks from today.  Right, but it's just, Mardi Gras is just drunks hanging around throwing beads.  And they're everywhere, too, because we set up this little area where we can broadcast  live, but all the people inside, they're completely hammered.  They're calling on our couch.  I think people are having sex on the couch we were just broadcasting from only a half hour  ago.  That's why when I was sitting on there, I was a little skeeved out.  Yeah, you were worried about a booger.  Yeah, I know, and I'm sitting on Jiz's couch. 
[02:28:30]  I have no idea what has been going on on that couch, but you can only imagine.  Club Soto Kenney, what's going on with you?  I'm just trying to keep the fans in line, but I just wanted to thank you guys for a  wonderful trip to Mardi Gras, and I wanted just the fans to know how terrific you fellas  are.  Well, I don't think we're that terrific today, but that's okay.  We were stressing about yesterday's show, and then we realized, you know, there's nothing  we can do to make this better.  It's just a cluster up. 
[02:29:00]  It's one big booze fest.  These are drunks that have a midlife crisis.  Yeah, this is the land of the raging alcoholics.  We saw more guys dressed as fairies today after breakfast.  Yeah.  Kenney and I are like thinking, anywhere else you dress like a fairy, you're going to get  laughed at.  But down here, you're like, wow, man, that's cool.  You go.  Yeah, it's completely acceptable.  Someone just got a Bloody Mary knocked out of their hand and was very angry down there.  And he was very angry to get an empty Opie and Anthony XM cup in return.  Yeah, I mean, are they guarding the door down there, by the way? 
[02:29:30]  Because there's a few people that really want to shot us at this point.  Probably want to punch us in the head.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy's back.  Yes.  What happened?  I got a lap dance.  It was very nice.  From what?  The Paris Hilton girl?  Yeah.  How was it?  I'm leaking stuff.  I'm leaking stuff.  I don't want to see that.  Lumping his pants.  Why are they yelling and screaming up here now?  Well, look at that guy dressed in...  He's dressed in a skirt, and he's got pigtails and a goatee. 
[02:30:00]  Ugh.  Yeah, but, you know, it's acceptable down here.  All right, well, look at the streets.  I mean, it is...  I haven't seen so much garbage in my life.  Well, now I don't...  And there's also a lot of beads on the ground.  Oh, that's terrific.  Cut it out.  You know what the scary thing is?  How long is it going to take them to realize they could just...  And how drunk they can get before they realize they can just pick up these sleaze beads  and lob them up here and pelt us with disgusting street sleaze beads. 
[02:30:30]  I hope they don't realize that.  Now, they haven't been able to really organize down there.  No, not thank God.  They really haven't, so...  What's our schedule, by the way?  We're flying tomorrow, and then we do real radio again Thursday and Friday?  Thursday.  I think tomorrow's our travel day.  Okay.  And then Thursday and Friday back live, 6 to 10 in the morning.  Oh, brother.  Oh, Jaime's like, Jaime, what happened?  You're just getting pissed off?  Jaime's pissed off because I think we wrecked his laptop.  Yeah.  So, he just handed us, like, the Mac Daddy of beads, like, bags and bags of beads. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, here we go.  We didn't wreck his laptop.  Some troublemaker did.  We're just trying to have some Mardi Gras fun.  Oh.  All right.  Everyone is digging into the beads.  Going for the heavy ones, too.  Now we got heavy ones.  All right.  Let's see what these guys got.  There will not be a safe drink.  All right.  All right.  Watch this little orange soda go.  Is she too young?  How old is that girl there?  Is she young?  I won't hit her if she's young.  Okay.  Well, if she's drinking a soda, that could be an indication she might be too young.  All right.  That's a lot.  That old guy is still down there, and he's winging beads up.  Look out.  Here comes another one.  Where is he?  Look at this.  This brother is a perfect target, but no one will take the shot. 
[02:31:30]  Where's the old guy?  The old guy is just, I don't know.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh!  Holy crap.  Best shot of the day.  Best shot of the day.  Best shot of the day.  Best shot of the two days, dude.  Dude, I just got a couple walking down the street with two drinks and one in each hand  and knocked the couple of drinks out of their hands.  Two drinks.  Shot of the day.  It was a boyfriend-girlfriend combination.  Both.  Very nice.  Both enjoying themselves, holding hands, and they both had a hurricane, and you knocked 
[02:32:00]  out both hurricanes.  Both of them in one shot.  Now I've got to try this lady right down here.  No one's going to beat that shot.  Shit.  Oh, God.  You just hit her in the chest.  You just hit her in the chest.  It was him.  It was him.  You can't be a dickhead, boy.  What's wrong with you?  It was him right here.  It was him.  Don't rat him out.  I'm getting him back for...  That's not good.  You can't break that.  That's a cardinal rule.  I'll get you there.  Shut up.  No blaming anyone.  All right.  See this guy here with the drink and the backpack?  He just turned around. 
[02:32:30]  Damn it.  Cup of coffee.  In that guy's hand?  What do you think?  Where?  Where?  Where?  The Vikings.  Oh, coffee is hot.  Here we go.  Oh, you hit him.  I spilled a little of it.  Right in the head.  If he didn't have that stupid, faggoty, choking Vikings hat on, he would be wearing hot  coffee on his wrist and forearm.  He took a head shot.  These beads are the perfect size, man.  All right.  The sounds of Mardi Gras. 
[02:33:00]  Look out.  Look out.  They're firing back.  See, so the brothers with the big ganja leaf necklaces around their neck.  Yeah.  Smoking the reefer.  And that was before they got here.  People shuffling by.  For some reason, they're really looking up at this balcony when they walk by.  Oh, they can sense everybody.  Yeah, I think they're on to us.  Yeah, they're firing back.  They're organizing.  They're organizing.  They're organizing.  Come on.  Let's go.  Let them.  Nothing. 
[02:33:30]  They got nothing.  They got nothing.  They just can't get it together.  All right.  Here, another couple.  This guy looks mean, though.  Shaved head.  Look at his chick.  Big red drink.  I'm going for him.  Wow.  There's so many bouncing.  Oh, he's a big guy.  Oh, my God.  Is he a big dude?  He's going to kick my ass.  No, I didn't even phase him.  Oh, good.  Okay.  You hit him on the skull and he could care less.  He didn't even notice.  He didn't even notice.  He thought it was a fly landed on his head.  I could hit him again, but I'll choose not to. 
[02:34:00]  He's got a big scar across his head like that.  Yeah, I wouldn't chance that one.  Come on, Nick.  Watch it.  Oh.  Oh.  That was a good catch.  Yeah.  All right.  Looking.  Next target.  Yeah, that guy's looking up here, though.  Which guy?  The shaved head guy with the...  Oh, someone just got nailed.  Someone down on the other side of the balcony just got nailed hard.  Those big bowling ball-sized beads are completely ridiculous. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, they're oversized beads that some of the guys are walking around in.  Yeah.  How could you even move through a crowd wearing those?  You know how much those cost in the gift shops?  I heard they're $80.  $80 for that.  And $5 if you go three blocks away.  The beads are almost as big as bowling balls, just to give you an idea.  And you look cool down here, but then you go home to your little hometown and people are like,  you spent $80 on...  What?  Look at two guys dressed like kids.  Oh, that's pretty good makeup there. 
[02:35:00]  Ace Frehley and Peter Criss makeup.  I should go down there and get blown off for a picture.  Oh, very close.  I saw a guy dressed like Gene before.  He didn't have the makeup, but he had a nozzle hanging off him.  Too bad there's no car crash sound.  Right there.  Certainly deserved it.  Oh, so close.  The guy's thanking you, Anthony.  He had no idea you were trying to take out his drink.  If I don't take the drink out, they thank us.  They look up and go, thanks for the beads.  Wow. 
[02:35:30]  The crowd growing in numbers here in front of our balcony.  Yep.  For some reason, I think we're missing enough that they're thinking we're giving away beads  instead of trying to hurt them with them.  Hey, what about that chick?  She's showing.  Look.  Not bad, right?  That one right there is very nice.  She's showing her drink.  Oh, you drunk whore.  Yeah.  I don't get that with the girls.  A lot of girls, they can't just show the boobs.  They have to stick out their tongue and make the stupid...  I'm showing you...  Look at this stupid face.  I'm showing you my boobs face.  I'm getting to all the sexiness right out of it.  I'm getting to the rest of the guy.  I'm a little rascal.  I'm so tempted. 
[02:36:00]  Come on.  He looks like the guy that they paralyzed in Clockwork Orange.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, we just hit him in the head, you heartless bastard.  I can't believe you just hit an old man on a little rascal with beads.  And he's looking up.  Bastard.  He's angry.  Hey, they enjoyed it.  He clothed the guy with a little rascal.  He all doubled over.  He's a real tough target at .3 miles an hour, Opie.  All five of those listeners that were just looking up are just rolling,  and they had to walk away.  They can't take it, because Opie's a heartless prick. 
[02:36:30]  All the anger I felt today...  Oh, wait.  This beautiful girl's going to show us.  Oh, wait.  She's taking her pants down.  What are you doing?  She's taking her belt off.  She's a 10.  Got a girl taking her belt off.  She's taking her belt off.  I want to be Barbie, her shirt says.  All right, hold on.  She's...  All right, this girl has the tightest jeans on,  and she just took her belt off.  She's pulling her...  Wow, she's pulling her pants down.  Her pants down.  Nice.  Now she's turning to us, and she's going to show us her ass.  I wouldn't mind it if it wasn't for those grandma panties.  Yeah, what are those?  Wow.  No, that's very nice.  Those are the hot pants. 
[02:37:00]  Throw beads in her ass.  Very nice.  Bravo.  Yeah.  There you go.  That was very sweet.  Now knock...  Now knock...  Knock the drink out of her hands.  Where's the drink?  Nah, she's well protected right now.  How about, um...  Nah, he doesn't have enough in there.  She's well protected.  I like getting full drinks when they...  When they splat on the ground, it's so satisfying.  This guy's got a mug, but it's not up to his face.  It's also a lot more pleasurable when they're drinking it, 
[02:37:30]  and it splashes right into their mug.  We're looking, we're looking.  There's no targets right now, huh?  No.  God, I can't believe I took out two of that one shot.  There's more boobies over there.  Very nice.  No more guys on there.  Little rascals, huh?  It's getting late.  Are a lot of people getting more drunken,  and you're seeing more boobies.  Oh, it's small pot, I think.  Oh, that girl just fell in the dirtiest water.  Look at her.  Oh, wow.  Oh, she is pissed. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, she fell in that filthy, awful water.  She just slid on her ass.  That's going to be all in her private area.  Yeah.  She will not be happy.  Come on, one more good target.  What are you telling us, Steve?  You need it.  I'm addicted to screwing these people's drinks up.  All right, guy in the gray shirt right here.  And pink drink, gray shirt.  Where, where, where?  Right there.  No, wait, wait.  Green armband.  Oh, I forgot that guy right there.  One, two, three. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, he missed.  Oh, damn it.  Did we get him?  No.  No, she lost her drink.  Oh, she dropped her.  She's all pissed.  Oh, look at her.  Look at her.  She's looking around.  She can't believe it.  Oh, she's yelling.  She's yelling, screaming.  Ah-ha.  That's what you get, whore.  She has no idea.  Look, they're looking around,  like trying to figure it out.  Here, you want these?  Yeah.  Oh, she's yelling.  Oh, she's yelling.  What happened?  What happened?  She's screaming at us.  Who cares? 
[02:39:00]  Oh, is she crying?  Good.  What happened?  Beat it, stupid.  What happened?  You're 15.  You shouldn't be drinking.  All right, she lost her drink.  She's very, very upset.  That's the sign of a true alcoholic.  That's what happened to Ben once  when he spilled his drink.  He just cried to the street.  Oh, she's mad.  Well, we're just about done  with our Mardi Gras broadcast  from the Crazy Horse.  Is that what we were doing?  Yeah, pretty much.  I thought for some reason  we were just hanging out  with these stupid headsets on.  Okay.  Oh, there you go. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, she's so upset.  I think at this point in the program  we try to find an old bit  so we can get out of here.  Ah, is that the old gag?  I remember that from the old days.  With just a little bit  of our dignity still intact.  What a sourpuss.  Yeah, she's still bummed out  over there, huh?  I want to now get her friend's drink  out of her hand.  The one that's being videotaped?  How about the guy's Coke right there?  Dude.  Oh, it's going to go  right into her face.  Oh, it actually landed  right on her drink.  Wow, now she's pissed.  Now she's taking the beads 
[02:40:00]  off her neck  and slamming them down  to the pavement.  You know why?  Because it hit his Coke  and splashed soda  into her face.  It splashed all over her face.  I don't know what happened.  She's yelling at us again.  She is pissed.  Why doesn't she just move on?  She doesn't get it.  She's crying.  She is so angry.  She's crying.  Oh my God, is she crying?  And they're standing there  so I'm going to throw  another one at that guy's  the same drink.  Wait, just make sure  that no one looks up.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Oh, she's covering it.  I won't even look at her though.  I'm looking like I have no idea.  Look, she's telling her boyfriend  there to cover the drink. 
[02:40:30]  Cover the drink.  Cover, cover.  Here we go.  Okay, see it?  It's exposed.  She's yelling at us.  She's so angry.  Look, they're distracted.  Now watch.  Oh, damn it.  That came up short.  It was perfect.  That's a horrible shot.  I don't know why  they will not move on.  It's stubbornness.  It's just not...  Okay, here we go.  They're defiant for some reason.  They're trying to show  that they can...  Oh, it went around her neck.  Oh my God,  you got her right around her neck.  I got the beat on her.  No, she's wearing the beat. 
[02:41:00]  I'm trying to give this  a couple of hangover ladies.  I don't know.  She's all pissed off.  Are they mad now?  They're getting mad at us.  Who cares?  Watch this.  I don't care.  I'm going to take out  her video camera.  No.  Oh my God.  Screw it.  Oh Jesus, Opie.  That's a whole bag  of beads you're throwing.  No, I'll throw the whole bag.  Don't do that.  Don't throw the whole bag.  No, don't do that.  Oh my God, you're insane.  I'm taking that girl's drink out.  I'm taking her drink out  right now.  Take it out.  Oh, you just missed. 
[02:41:30]  Damn it.  You just missed.  So close.  All right, pick it up.  It's right there.  She's taunting me.  Here you go.  Here, take those.  There you go.  Oh, Christ.  There was liquid in this one.  Oh, right there.  Beer.  Rain.  All right, Anthony.  We're going to wrap up  the festivities here  from the Crazy Horse  on Bourbon Street.  Hit it.  He held it.  Yep.  Damn it.  We're going to go to a bit.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  All right.  You want to play High Mom?  Yeah.  Yeah, Eric will play  one of our High Mom 
[02:42:00]  crank calls.  We'll return for live radio  on Thursday.  They're still standing there.  They're still there.  On Thursday and Friday  we'll be back in New York  doing our regular broadcast.  Oh, we've got to get up early.  You know, we have to tell people  if you just picked up  the high voltage channel  on XM Satellite Radio.  It's a lot different  than we're on in New York.  And we're going to get ready  for our trip to L.A.  in two weeks.  Yep.  You're going to be doing  that poker thing out there.  That's right.  World Poker Tour. 
[02:42:30]  I'm in the Celebrity Pro Invitational.  Very psyched about that.  It's going to be a lot of fun  and we'll be on the road  in L.A., Hollywood.  I want to thank the whole gang  for helping us out today.  Ben for producing the program,  losing his mind  in the other room.  He's doing the best  that he can to produce this.  Jaime, thank you so much  for everything you've done.  And Ben, can we go to the bid  at any time?  All right, go.  We're out of here.  Bye.  Jason, are you ready to play  Hi, Mom, I'm in jail?  Yeah.  You got a good story?  Yeah.  What are you going to tell her?  I'm going to tell her  I had marijuana. 
[02:43:00]  I got caught by the cops.  Will that piss her off?  Yep.  All right, let's give her a shot.  Drugs.  Hello?  Mom?  What?  I screwed up.  What?  I'm in jail.  Why?  I have possession of marijuana.  You're kidding?  I don't know who to call.  Should I call Uncle Mark?  It's my one phone call.  Should I call Uncle Mark or something?  I'll ask you.  If this is your one phone call,  I'll have to call him.  What do you need?  I don't know.  The call is being monitored, ma'am, 
[02:43:30]  by the police department.  Okay.  What does he need to do?  The judge came in and set bail at $10,000.  It's a very serious offense.  $10,000?  Well, if it was a joint or two,  it would be one thing.  He was caught with 12 kilos in his trunk,  obviously trying to deal.  So he's being arraigned as a dealer  and not as a user.  Okay.  Okay.  When is all this and when did... 
[02:44:00]  Where are you...  Where is he and where can I come see him?  I'm in Cambridge now at the Cambridge jail.  We're going to bring him to one of the city jails.  Okay.  How can I get directions to get there?  Can I get there, talk to him,  tell me what I need to do.  I'm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  What, Ma, what should I do?  Like a lawyer?  Yeah, you need a lawyer?  Well, he's been crying like a girl, too.  Well, he's...  I've got to get to the bottom of this. 
[02:44:30]  He's a very good person.  I've heard that before.  It's more of that bad parenting.  I've seen this before with these kids.  They run the street...  They're running around the streets like wild.  And now they're selling drugs?  Did you know your son was doing this?  No, no.  Not to mention with the...  Being found with the prostitute in the car,  in the combat zone?  That's...  That's...  What is that all about?  Don't...  Don't even deny it, son. 
[02:45:00]  Okay, please, please.  Don't even...  He's already given a full confession  before he even talked to a lawyer,  which just shows how smart he is.  Okay, officer.  Sonny.  I didn't know what to do.  Okay, officer.  Yes, ma'am.  Please, please help me, okay?  I'm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  I'm three hours away.  Please give me directions of how to get there  and where you are,  and I will be there.  Well, by that time,  he's going to be transported out of here. 
[02:45:30]  I'm not sure where they're taking him,  but I'm sure which jail we do take him to,  they're going to like him real good there tonight,  if you know what I mean.  He's pretty good looking.  Yeah, he better not drop that soap,  if you know what I mean.  Please, sir.  I think Bubba...  Bubba's going to like him in the shower room,  if you know what I mean, ma'am.  Listen, officer.  Yes, ma'am.  We...  You're a good family, blah, blah, blah.  I've heard it before, miss.  I've heard it before.  Okay, you've heard it before,  but you're not...  All right, all right.  He's had enough. 
[02:46:00]  He's had enough.  He's had enough.  Mom, you're on the radio.  Oh, my goodness.  Mom?  He couldn't take it anymore.  Mom?  What?  You're on the radio.  Huh?  It's a joke.  Oh, Jason.  Happy Mother's Day.  Happy Mother's Day, Mom.  Who is this?  This is Opie and Anthony.  We do a radio show in Boston.  Well, he is a good kid,  but he's written out of the will. 
[02:46:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This concludes our podcast.  It would be an Anthony show. </pre>
