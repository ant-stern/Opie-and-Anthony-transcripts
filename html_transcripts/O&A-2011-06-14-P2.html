<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show covered a wide range of topics throughout its broadcast.  The show began with discussions surrounding Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal, using highly vulgar language to describe the situation and debating whether his actions required sex rehab. This segued into a lengthy critique of Tracy Morgan's apology tour following his homophobic remarks, with the hosts attacking GLAAD and other groups for what they perceived as a hypocritical and agenda-driven response.  They contrasted the outrage over Morgan's comments with the treatment of other comedians like Lenny Bruce, exploring the evolving landscape of political correctness and the difficulty of creating truly unfiltered comedy. Jim Norton was mentioned in passing.

The broadcast then shifted to a discussion of Richard Pryor's controversial stand-up routine, highlighting Pryor's jokes about race, sexuality, and his mother's prostitution.  This was followed by a segment featuring Anthony's and Bobo's dream narratives, with Anthony's dream involving a nosebleed interrupting a potential romantic encounter and overhearing a conversation about a threesome, and Bobo's dream featuring a party with numerous women. Bobo, potentially a guest, also promoted his upcoming stand-up show.  Technical difficulties with the show's online stream were addressed through a humorous exchange with a Sirius XM employee, "Mars."  The death of Liquid Metal DJ Mario Comisonis was also mentioned, alongside audio clips of Rich Voss's stand-up and a previous clip of Roland's failed attempt at heavy metal vocalizations.

A subsequent segment started with a discussion about hangovers, transitioning into a game identifying monster roars.  E-Rock's eHarmony videos were then featured, followed by a prolonged, largely unsuccessful attempt to get a punchline from "the Virus" regarding the Weiner scandal.  The show then covered a news story about a Fox Business anchor accused of racism for using Ebonics, and the story of a St. Louis woman awarded $95 million after an alleged assault by her boss.  This led to a discussion of the Casey Anthony trial and the hosts' personal experiences with mentally unstable individuals and difficult family relationships.  Audio from a news interview with the daughter of a chimpanzee attack victim, highlighting the reporter's unawareness of the victim's blindness, was played.  Further technical issues with studio computers were also mentioned.

The show continued with a reflection on negative Christmas experiences and unhealthy parental attachments.  This led to a discussion of a YouTube video by the Ultimate Warrior containing explosive accusations against Hulk Hogan, including allegations of cocaine use, infidelity, and offering his wife to other wrestlers.  A phone interview with Esther Ku, a comedian from *Last Comic Standing*, followed.  The conversation with Ku covered her family background, her stand-up career, her experiences with racial humor and censorship, and explicit details about her sex life, including a song about masturbation.

A later segment focused on Esther Koo (potentially the same person as Esther Ku), a musical guest, discussing her career, including a song appearing on a Brazilian porn site.  The conversation included discussions about buttholes, her guitar players (described as smelling bad), and her experiences performing in various venues, including the Parkside Lounge and Central Park.  She also detailed her role in a *Cookout* sequel, her interactions with Wendy Williams, and her experiences with men of different races.  A physical altercation between Esther and Sam Roberts, the show's producer, resulting in Esther kicking Sam, was also described.  The segment concluded with discussions of Will Smith's surprise studio visit, behind-the-scenes anecdotes about talent booking, issues with Tracy Morgan and Mike Rowe, and a recap of a previous "walk over" segment with Tracy Morgan.

[00:03:00]  and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard.  You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, certainly not the most listened  to a show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're going to have a ball.  America's most trusted name in news, the O.P. and Anthony radio show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, O.P. and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way.  Thank you, Larry King.  Thank you.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hi, everybody.  How you doing?  Doing well.  On this wonderful whatever morning.  See, I don't say the day anymore, just in case they play it, you know, replay or something.  I think it sounds silly. 
[00:04:30]  I like listening to replays.  Yeah.  Because I get tricked.  Do you?  Yeah, then I'm thinking, oh, wait a minute, I'm not there.  So how do you think where it works?  I get tricked.  It tricked me.  I tricked myself.  Hockey.  You guys know.  Hockey.  You guys know I like my hockey, right?  Of course.  I'm fading.  When is hockey going to be over?  July?  Apparently tomorrow, I guess, huh?  It was an exciting game last night.  Bruins beat the Canucks to push a game seven. 
[00:05:00]  But, well, it's June 14th.  I told Anthony, my last hockey game, I went to a game maybe four months ago at this point.  Yeah.  I haven't been to a hockey game in four months, and I'm a regular at the rink.  At the rink.  I know my team sucked a dick, but still, I mean, I haven't gone to a hockey game in four months.  They're still playing.  Yeah.  Wow.  Apparently, Boston.  Holy, holy Jesus.  Palomino.  Well, they're going to have to win in Vancouver, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That might be a little tough. 
[00:05:30]  But quite a few.  What did they score?  Four?  It was.  In like a little over four minutes.  Oh, yeah.  You were there then.  You were on top of that.  That's crazy.  Well, there's so many Boston people that we all know, especially these dumbass comics.  Yeah.  I'm kidding.  But they're constantly tweeting, like, holy shit.  The score and stuff.  You know, the score and things like that.  And, you know, I saw some highlights and stuff.  And, wow, they had to pull the goalie.  He was giving up crazy.  He was not standing on his head. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  It was 4-0 early.  Yeah.  And I had the Louis C.K. Season 2 that I brought home yesterday.  And I really wanted to watch hockey.  I didn't know what to do.  And they made it very obvious what I needed to do.  The game was over.  Even though it only ended up at 5-2.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it was 4-zip very early on.  I'm like, all right, this thing is over.  They're going to be playing a Game 7.  I want to check out some Louis C.K.  You could watch some shit for pure pleasure.  You get your Louis C.K. disc?  No, I didn't. 
[00:06:30]  And I'm kind of thinking.  What do you mean you didn't?  Whale.  Whale.  Did you run out of here too fast yesterday?  No, no, no.  I'm learning we can't run out of here too fast.  Too fast.  But Roland told me it was going to be today.  I would get it.  No.  Yeah.  He would never just give me one.  No, no.  He said more was showing up later.  So I could have hung out and gotten it yesterday.  Oh, but you wanted out of here.  I got to do my kettlebell workouts.  Oh, it's crazy. 
[00:07:00]  Is it crazy or cray cray?  It's cray cray.  Is that cray cray?  It's crazy.  That's the Monday routine is that.  And then Wednesday is arms and upper.  And then Friday is legs and stuff.  Jeez.  You're all in, man.  So it's like, yeah, I have to be at this point.  Brr.  I want to be like Wiener.  I want to be like Anthony Wiener and take my shirt off  and take creepy pictures and send them to girls  while I hold my dick.  My dick.  My dick.  But you got to explain, they're creepy because of the look he did. 
[00:07:30]  Yes, the snarling look.  Yes, in those pictures.  Wow, sexy man.  The creepy part isn't that he showed his dick.  No, who cares?  For the most part.  It's because of that creepy look.  That creep look.  He looks in the camera like, I look good.  Yeah, look at me.  And here's my dick.  Look at me.  Shut up.  Even Obama had to basically comment on the Wiener thing.  Obama was like, yeah.  Like him or hate him, he's the president of the United States  and he has to comment about Wiener and his dick.  Yeah, he said, he goes, you know, if he was in that position,  he'd resign. 
[00:08:00]  And all I was thinking is, please, could there be some pictures of Obama?  Please.  Grab him that big hog.  Yeah, that big delicious hog.  Jesus.  I got the Obama thing quick.  You brought it up here.  Obama.  This is Obama.  On a day when President Barack Obama.  God, I hate this guy.  He's awful.  On a day when President Obama.  On a day when.  Bloody, bloody, bloody, bloody.  How the hell did this guy get him broadcasting?  I know.  He stinks. 
[00:08:30]  Who did he track you to sleep?  He sounds like Bobby?  Bobby?  I saw Obama, Bobby.  Bobby?  On a day when President Barack Obama traveled to North Carolina.  He bought some poor pain.  He also weighed in on the Twitter scandal.  Twisper is currently engulfing New York Representative Anthony Weiner.  Obama said in an interview that will air Tuesday on NBC's Today Show,  quote, I can tell you that if it was me, I would resign. 
[00:09:00]  The House will be in order.  Congress returned to work Monday, but the congressman was not.  By the way, that was Anthony Weiner's dick.  His dick.  He's using it as a gavel.  Yeah, they are.  He lent it out as a gavel.  I don't know if you know that, but that's exactly what's going on.  Listen, again, it's Anthony Weiner's fucking dick.  Carter.  Congress returned to work Monday.  He must have been really grabbing the shaft, thus making the head nice and tough and hard.  Was it turgid?  Turgid.  To get that rigid wood sound.  I want to thank Jimmy for bringing the word turgid to this show. 
[00:09:30]  It's very unrived.  Because I don't think I ever used that word in my life before.  Yes, turgid.  Jimmy brought it here.  Now I can't say it enough.  It's a wonderful word.  Turgid.  The house will be in order.  Congress returned to work Monday, but the congressman was not in his office.  What?  I've made some mistakes.  I've acknowledged it.  Instead, speaking to reporters over the weekend, he has reportedly gone into rehab at an undisclosed location for a disorder.  This world is insane. 
[00:10:00]  You've got Anthony Weiner going to sex rehab, which I think in this case is complete and utter bullshit.  That's nothing.  It's a guy that just doesn't want to be married and be a father, in my humble opinion.  He wants to be shown his dick.  His dick on this new technology.  Right, to a lot of fucking women.  Yeah.  And then you get Tracy Morgan, who's got to go to Nashville and make believe he cares about gay people.  When you know he really doesn't.  In my humble opinion.  In my opinion.  I don't think he hates gay people, but he doesn't care about it. 
[00:10:30]  No, it's not like this big care thing where all of a sudden now he feels legitimately inside.  He feels he should make restitution and get involved in the gay causes.  No!  I had to do that with you.  I'm sorry.  I know that's your thing, but it's driving me nuts.  It's crazy.  He apologized for something he said.  This has been eating me away all night.  He apologized for something he said on a comedy stage when he absolutely was doing his act.  He wasn't even doing a Michael Richards thing, so you can't even argue that part of this. 
[00:11:00]  You can't even argue that part of it.  There's so many comics I've talked to, including Jimmy Norton, that said at some point or another,  when it finally hits the stage, when the shit finally hits the stage, and not in a Michael Richards way.  But just in your basic material.  No matter what it is, when they finally call you out and you have to make an apology for  that, we are really fucking doomed.  But it's been happening, though.  It's not a new thing.  It's like, since Lenny Bruce, and I'm not comparing Tracy to Lenny, but I'm saying people have always 
[00:11:30]  judged you on what you said on stage.  And what we do now is we grab somebody, find out what, we like, people like to use a moment  like that as a segue into their particular ideology being talked about more.  Like, if it's, if, if, where's the Catholics?  Where are, where are all the Catholics who are offended?  Oh, that's right.  It's not their thing.  Right.  It's only because they, if they, if they homosexuals, they can hear from the homosexuals.  In two weeks, somebody will say something about the Asians.  Homosexuals won't say a fucking word. 
[00:12:00]  No.  They'll be the Asians.  Everyone uses a verbal slip up or, or a tasteless moment on stage to segue into a conversation  about themselves and their own cause.  It's very frustrating.  I know it's been happening since Lenny Bruce, but what's scaring me is it seems like it's  ramping up.  Seems like it's ramping up a little bit.  Yeah, and also, I think we're going to have a lot of Tracy Morgan incidents in the next  year or two.  Oh, if that's going to be the new fucking thing to pick on.  I'm telling you, I think it's ramping up now.  Yeah, you know, it was very, um, he talked about abusing women and, uh, spousal abuse, 
[00:12:30]  and that just is not anything to make a joke about.  Some of the funniest shit I've heard is, is about that.  You watch the honeymoon as he's threatening to punch his wife in the face.  It's classic.  Comedy.  No, uh, the, the lock horns.  Right.  Breitbart said, he had an amazing quote.  He said, I hate to keep putting Breitbart like he's fucking Aristotle, but he made a great  point.  What he said that comedy is the exhaust system of a society, which is a great way to look 
[00:13:00]  at it.  It really is this, I don't look at it like it dictates policy or it makes things a certain  way or it changes perception.  It is just a venting system for when you, for when you're frustrated, when you're frustrated  or when you see something funny.  What you need to run the car.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  It's not just shit coming out.  It's, it's important.  Yeah.  It's kind of what you do with the process of, like, I guess the car runs and the exhaust  is the shit coming out the back.  Yeah.  Right.  But you kind of need it to, to keep that car running. 
[00:13:30]  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, he had a great take on this.  But I'm on the tailpipe routine.  The black, uh, the black Roland that's on CNN had a great take on this.  Although, all I, I didn't agree with his, uh, I miss thing, uh, so much.  He said, I miss, he was pretty open-minded about this whole thing in general, but said  I miss definitely should have been fired because he, he wasn't considered a, like a shock  jock when he said nappy headed hoes.  Stop with the semantics.  Like he was having some, some pretty powerful people on that show.  So he wasn't looked at as a shock jock anymore. 
[00:14:00]  And he, this was his point.  I'm not sure if I agree with it, but it opened my mind a little bit.  I have to be honest with you.  He said, if a shock jock said nappy headed hoes, uh, most likely people would have just  said, ah, no big deal.  But because it was I miss and, uh, he was having these powerful, powerful people on his  show that made it different.  That's what, that's what he's saying.  I don't know if I agree, but it was an interesting way to look at it.  I think that's his way of wanting.  I miss fired for offending what he holds sacred, but not wanting to even admit to himself. 
[00:14:30]  He said something I don't like.  I want him fired.  Everyone has like a little, a little check mark next to why they're saying it.  Like, here's why in this case, you shouldn't say that because people are never going to  be revealing enough to go, you know what?  It's selfish.  I didn't like it.  I want you to get in trouble because I didn't like it.  People will never give you that, that, that piece of honesty for themselves.  But he did admit, you know, uh, no one should be using the N word.  You can't be the guy saying, well, we should be able to use the N word, but you know, white 
[00:15:00]  people, let's say are not allowed to that.  He says that's completely ridiculous.  He's right.  Although it should be across the board.  If that's, if that's, if that's your thinking, the seven dirty words are fair because not  one broadcaster can say cunt on the radio, like terrestrial radio or TV.  No one can say, fuck you.  No one can say tits.  You can't say it.  Black, white, Asian.  That's all you ask for is consistency.  If a gay guy did certain things that, uh, uh, Tracy said, even if he worded a little bit  differently, but he was just as harsh about his own family. 
[00:15:30]  Well, that would be art because the point of the joke was his own family.  You know what I mean?  If you're saying the right thing, you're, you're allowed to say it.  If you're saying something that, that is disagreeable to certain people, you're not  allowed to say it's fucking phony.  Yeah.  Can I say stuff because I consider myself a psychopath?  Does that open me up to where I can now say anything because I am crazy?  Right.  Yeah.  The crazy, but hey, wait a minute.  I'm a nut.  I can say shit like that.  It's, oh, that's like the ultimate, but yeah, if you're gay, you can say shit about 
[00:16:00]  gay people.  If you're black, you can say anything about black people, uh, and go down the line.  But you should be able to say whatever the fuck you want, especially on a comedy stage.  Especially on a comedy stage.  Especially.  Yeah.  Okay.  There's consequences if you walk around your office saying what Tracy Morgan said, obviously.  Right.  Okay.  And, but on a comedy stage, that's what's so ridiculous about this.  The fact that Tracy did apologize is good enough.  He acknowledged it.  An apology was down.  And that's what I guess the 30 Rock people were asking for, an apology.  And they were the ones that really made him apologize. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, it's a fake apology.  As a standup, the best thing is you guys work alone.  You guys are just there on stage with your material and you could say, fuck you.  I'm not going to do it.  But Tracy was in that position of working for a network and you do have to make some concessions.  But to the extent where now he's got to meet with GLAAD and all kinds of sensitivity shit, that is horse shit.  The headline, Tracy Morgan working with GLAAD following anti-gay tirade. 
[00:17:00]  Tracy Morgan's voice is support for gay marriage after apologizing.  I think they should be able to get mad for homophobic comments.  That's what I think.  And he needs to do a PSA.  This is all phony shit that he's being forced to do.  It's very phony.  How about this?  Because Tracy's a famous guy.  Yeah.  I would do a PSA for gay, anti-gay violence and I've never gotten in trouble for saying anything.  Oh, yeah.  I have never.  And I'm not nearly as famous as Tracy is.  Oh, they don't want you.  But why would they?  Right.  I'm a fucking nasty comedian. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  I don't want to see violence against gays.  I think it's terrible.  I'm willing to do a PSA.  They won't ask me to do that unless I was to say something very anti-gay in my act, get in trouble, and get my name in the headlines.  They want it to be a consequence.  Yeah.  They want it to be a punishment.  Not a sincere apology and helping them.  They want it to be a punishment.  They're despicable, this Glad, because they're basically holding Tracy Morgan hostage now.  They got him.  They got him.  They're like, you're going to do what we want now.  And we'll tell you when it's enough. 
[00:18:00]  And then we won't go to your bosses and we won't boycott and we won't do this.  Yeah, absolutely.  And in this society, an apology means nothing.  Society.  It means absolutely nothing.  When you're growing up, if you did something wrong, you could pretty much get out of a lot of shit by apologizing and meaning it.  Like, oh, yeah, I was a dick that day or whatever.  But now, man, that don't mean shit.  That's only the start.  That's where you start.  That's where you start with the apology.  And then it's just eating shit the whole way throughout the process. 
[00:18:30]  That's why I think Glad is despicable in these other groups.  I'm not just pointing out Glad.  They all do it.  The Asian groups do it.  The black groups have done it.  You start with the apology and then we got you.  We're holding you hostage and we'll let you know when we'll let go of you.  And they all start off well-intentioned.  Like, what they do, like, gays and lesbians not wanting to be abused in the media or whatever.  Hey, look, they got a shitty deal.  I mean, they can't get married. 
[00:19:00]  They can't, you know, it's like enough or they're probably sick and tired of having to fight forgetting what most people are allowed to have just by being alive.  But they go too far.  When you start targeting what people are saying in humor, and it's like, I don't know what Tracy sounded like when he said it.  Maybe he sounded like he meant it.  I don't know.  But it's like they would have to run Howard for that gay joke.  They target jokes and references that aren't based in hatred, and they know the difference.  Every moment cannot be used to segue into a conversation about your cause or your legitimate beefs. 
[00:19:30]  And it's affected comedies.  That's why most comedies fucking blow now.  Every once in a while, one gets through the cracks, obviously.  But in general, man, they got it set up where it's really tough to make funny movies or funny TV shows.  And just like you said about you hadn't heard Tracy's comment in the context and the way he said it, neither did 99.999% of the people that are pissed about this and making him apologize.  Maybe a couple of people in the club heard it.  One person heard it, was offended, and then went out and talked to his minion, and they read, you know, what he said, not even knowing how it was said. 
[00:20:00]  At least Jimmy could say, look, I don't know how it was said, so I don't know.  But these people are like, well, we don't know how it's said, but when I read it, it sure looks offensive.  I swear to you, that's an old joke, man.  I can't prove it, but I feel like I've heard that before from Tracy, and we've seen him over the years.  He may have done it even at one of our virus shows.  I can't prove that, but I just have this feeling that that joke's been around a while in Tracy's repertoire. 
[00:20:30]  Maybe.  And this is why special interest groups all of them are terrible.  Look at what happened with Wiener, and the feminist groups are coming out, and they're in a tough position because he's a type of politician they like, and they're not going after him.  They're saying, well, apparently our congressman was a 14-year-old boy.  They're giving him the, you know what, he was kind of a bad boy excuse.  Dice Clay, they wanted to lynch in 1989 and 1990. 
[00:21:00]  Yep.  This guy is sending photos of his dick, he communicated with a 17-year-old, and they're giving him a pass.  But we all know what he was doing with the 17-year-old, but you can't say it or prove it.  He was fishing.  Lining up his ducks.  The guy was fishing, seeing if there was a possibility there.  But being that they're like that, how can anybody respect any special interest group?  They're so inconsistent.  They're so self-serving.  And they so keep quiet when it doesn't serve their interest to be loud.  We've known Tracy for many, many years.  Unfortunately, he doesn't do our show as much as he used to, but... 
[00:21:30]  As if ever, the bees scared him.  Yeah.  That's the last time he did our show.  But reading these articles, you just know Tracy's like, what the fuck?  Tracy Morgan has told GLAAD President Jared Barrios that he will team up with the group to meet with LGBT youth and participate in an anti-bullying PSA.  What is LGBT?  Lesbian, gay...  Bisexual, transgender, I guess.  Bisexual, transgender. 
[00:22:00]  Transgender really is involved in that?  Well, and I must step in here.  All right.  During a call, Morgan committed to meet with LGBT youth from New York's Alley Forney Center who have been hurt or left homeless by parental rejection,  as well as family members who have lost children to anti-gay violence, according to GLAAD.  Just all this for a fucking joke.  Now he has to be educated.  Right.  But if you're saying that for real, there's a difference between that and joking around.  Everybody knows the difference.  I'm not going to lie to you.  It's extremely sad that you got some kids that are homeless and shit because their families didn't want to accept their gayness. 
[00:22:30]  That's really sad.  Yes.  Gayness?  But what does that have to do with fucking Tracy Morgan?  Oh, I heard that wrong.  Yeah, nothing.  Seriously?  Yeah.  It's not his fucking responsibility?  Right.  No.  He's doing his job just like everybody.  And, you know, to bring up Lenny Bruce and stuff like that, that was also during a time where people were really fucking kind of crazy about that.  And it was considered indecency.  It wasn't about offending people on a group basis. 
[00:23:00]  Like, it was more about indecency and the law.  Like, the police came in and arrested them for offensive language that was against the law.  This is a politically correct thing.  It transcends.  It's worse.  It's worse than the cops coming in and arresting Lenny Bruce on stage for saying, fuck, because it's considered offensive and obscene, actually. 
[00:23:30]  Can I share the difference?  I think it's all the same thing because it comes from the same place.  But it's become more covert.  You can't do that anymore.  Right.  Everybody knows you can't pull a guy off stage.  It's almost like I'm sure certain acts of racism have become more covert because you can't just say, hey, boy, what are you doing here?  So you keep it more subtle.  My house.  Stuff while your house is a little bit.  You know what I'm saying?  Sure.  You can't do it that way.  And it's the same offensive and indecency that they saw was offending religion. 
[00:24:00]  And that's how these people feel about what Tracy said.  Yeah.  And you make a good point.  It's very similar to what went on in radio.  Like people getting fired and stuff, not for FCC, you know, violations.  No, no.  For PC crap.  Like you said, more subtle, like the special interest groups getting to the corporate heads.  And the way they were saying it was, oh, look, hey, we're not trying to squash people's freedom of speech, but we don't like what you said.  So not the FCC, no laws, but we're going to go to your boss and we're going to exercise our right to protest and boycott the sponsors and everything. 
[00:24:30]  And it's like, really, aren't you just taking a fucking left turn here and really restricting freedom of speech?  Again, it's just semantics.  Again, you're using a different technique to squash people's freedom of speech.  It's a threat of some type of retribution, not based on just a natural occurrence, based on what I'm saying. 
[00:25:00]  I say something anti-gay in a joking manner.  No laws prohibit me from doing that.  But because someone's offended, they now have an avenue to pursue getting me fired.  So that's no different than there being a law against me saying something anti-gay, even in humor.  And that's why I go back to Jimmy.  That's way worse.  Way worse.  And we hated the FCC, but it turned out the FCC wasn't the enemy.  No.  How many radio guys got fired in the last five, six years, okay? 
[00:25:30]  And how many of them deserved to be fired because they went against FCC regulations?  I don't think one.  I think it was all that PC bullshit.  I couldn't think of one off the top of my head.  And the station saying they have a zero-tolerance policy against this type of hate speech.  Stop with your hate speech.  You want hate speech?  Watch me drive home.  Even the radio show where the woman died with the water drinking contest, horrible situation, obviously.  Within FCC regulations.  Yeah.  Believe it or not. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, man.  It's just a horrible tragedy.  I'm not trying to defend those guys, but I'm just saying overall, I can't think of a DJ or a radio show that got fired because of the FCC.  No.  I can't think of one.  But a lot of them have been fired because of the shit they've said on the air.  Yeah.  I'll bet you everybody who's offended by what Tracy said.  And there's a lot of people that might be really upset.  No.  I'll bet you if you polled them, let's just say there's a hundred of them.  Yeah.  I'll bet you 90 of them, when the Janet Jackson thing happened, went, who gives a fuck?  Let it go.  What? 
[00:26:30]  You're worried about a titty?  What the fuck?  It's all where you're standing.  It's like everyone wants to legislate the way you think.  It's so irritating.  And it's like, I never want anybody penalized for what they're saying in that stuff.  So why can't everybody be like that?  It's like you're screaming and nobody's listening.  And historically, the gays are more open.  Very.  Well, they're more open to people being able to speak about different subject matter and  take it to the limit because they would like to have certain freedoms that they don't have. 
[00:27:00]  So the freedom of speech and things like that, very important.  But then, yeah, like Jimmy said, they hear one thing that's against them, regardless of  the context.  And I've got to shut that down.  Well, you now make a good point.  And this might surprise you, my friend.  But I was checking out the Twitter trend, Tracy Morgan, you know, when this all hit.  And very disappointed in black people in general that were part of that Twitter trend because 
[00:27:30]  they were defending Tracy.  Like, he should be able to say this and do this, which I agree with.  But then I'm thinking these same people, when the nappy-headed hole went down, were like  almost celebrating.  And it's the same fucking thing.  That, again, is based on the fact that he's black, I miss white, so.  Right.  But that goes with your point, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  It's okay when it hits your group.  But then as soon as it hits another group, oh, my God. 
[00:28:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  No matter how liberal and open-minded you are, if something, you know, hits you directly,  you're going to be all pissed off.  Right.  But you can't have it both ways.  I mean, the same people going, you know, Tracy should have been allowed to do this, should  have been kind of on Imus' side, which I know that might be tough for some people to do.  But that's the point we're kind of making today.  That's why you can't respect any of it.  And we all know the difference between doing racial humor and what Michael Richards did.  Like, I think most common-sense people know the difference in your intent. 
[00:28:30]  And intent is everything.  Like, if you're walking by a guy and he steps on your foot and he goes, oh, sorry, there's  a lot different than a guy stepping on your foot and then making eye contact with you going,  what?  They're both the same thing, but the intent is different.  So the intent means everything.  If you're trying to make people laugh, it's a lot different than if you're trying to hurt  people and penalize them.  Yeah.  The Michael Richards thing obviously was tough.  You know, it was on a comedy stage.  But I remember when I was coming up in this business, bosses always said, just give me something  that I could defend you with. 
[00:29:00]  You know what I mean?  And in the Michael Richards situation, it was tough because for a lot of people, that  wasn't his act, which made it really tough to defend that.  I still think he, you know, on a comedy stage, anything should go.  But I think we got a little carried away with that one.  That was a tougher one, though, to defend.  He deserved getting shit for it because he got caught.  He was being angry.  And there is a difference between that and being funny.  If he had said something like that, but in humor or there was a punch.  There was a punchline to it.  Right.  But he really wasn't. 
[00:29:30]  He was just calling people niggers.  He was mad.  You can't yell that at a table.  Right.  But social justice, again, should be, he's lucky that that table full of guys didn't  fucking throw a bottle at him or knock his teeth out because that's a stupid thing to  yell in a public place at somebody.  But they also came right back at him with racial epithets.  Absolutely.  Which, you know, okay.  Which is fine.  So they got Tracy Morgan.  He's being held hostage.  So we might have to get a team together to go rescue him.  Make for a good action movie, I think. 
[00:30:00]  He's going to be doing the Amplify Your Voice PSA campaign to combat anti-LGBT bullying.  Additionally, Morgan plans to return to Tennessee.  He's got a whole fucking schedule now.  Going back to Tennessee next week to apologize to audience members offended by his comments.  I would bet how I would say 1%.  Yeah.  I would say 1% of the people. 
[00:30:30]  But I'm sure there'll be hundreds of people that show up for the apology because they get  to see Tracy Morgan.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  According to Glad, Morgan told the group Monday that he regretted his remarks.  I know how bad bullying can hurt.  He said, I was bullied when I was a kid.  Oh, okay.  We know Tracy.  This is not Tracy.  I would bully.  We understand.  He's got a great gig and he's doing what he can.  But once again, this is all bullshit in the end.  I was bullied when I was a kid.  I'm sorry for what I said.  I didn't mean it.  I never want to use my comedy to hurt anyone. 
[00:31:00]  My family knew what it was like to feel different.  My brother was disabled and I lost my father to AIDS in 1987.  I didn't know that.  My dad wasn't gay, but I also learned about homophobia then because of how people treated  people who were sick with that.  Parents should support and love the kids no matter what.  Gay people deserve the same right to be happy in this country as everyone else.  Our laws should support that.  I hope that my fans, gay, straight, whatever, forgive.  And I hope my family forgives me for this.  His family don't care.  Can I say this, though?  About this.  If that's... 
[00:31:30]  I don't know Tracy well enough to know how he feels about gay people.  I really don't.  But is that the way he really feels?  Like, does he really feel like, hey, look, all kidding aside, I don't...  I think gay should be married.  Maybe he really does feel that way.  Oh, he probably thinks gay should be married.  He probably doesn't give a crappy other way.  Which doesn't make...  Yeah, if he feels gay should be married, that has no bearing on what he says about gays in  his act.  Right.  No, it shouldn't.  But although he should kind of...  You know, you should somehow give that in your act. 
[00:32:00]  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, wherever you really stand...  Yeah, yeah.  You should make that kind of the point of what you're doing, wherever you really stand,  even if it's wrong.  So I don't know what the way he really feels is.  I didn't know his father died of AIDS, though.  I didn't know that either.  Maybe I'm lying.  Yeah.  But again, is that...  Tracy can be...  I'm sorry.  Like, let's say he makes fun of AIDS.  You can't say that he doesn't know what it's like...  Right.  ...to suffer from that or to have somebody who loves suffer from that.  Mm-hmm.  So does that give him the right to make fun of AIDS?  Yes.  Of course it does.  And I'm sure a lot...  Now it does.  I'm sure a lot of people made fun of Tracy about his father. 
[00:32:30]  Yep.  So Tracy's sort of right in there, no?  Sure.  Kind of what he was saying, yeah.  Probably had to say a million times that his father wasn't gay and had to explain it.  Yeah, in 87.  Absolutely.  If anyone got AIDS, they thought it was...  It's called the gay disease for fucking...  Forever.  ...for years, yeah.  Still.  And then the...  Do you want the...  I mean, the apology's just ridiculous, but I think most of us sort of know this, right?  Waddle doodle!  Apologize!  What did he say?  I didn't actually read it. 
[00:33:00]  I guess Russell Simmons is getting involved.  Oh, God.  Why?  I believe everyone deserves the right to be happy and marry who they want to, gay, white,  black, male, or female, Morgan told Simmons.  And when Simmons emphasized the timeliness of this issue as we try to get gay marriage passed  in New York, Morgan jumped at the chance to lend his voice.  Let me know where the rally's at, Russ.  He said...  I'll be there.  I'll be there.  I'll be there. 
[00:33:30]  The apology.  I guess the reason I'm successful is because I'm so unfiltered.  Yes.  Yes.  And we like that in entertainment.  We like unfiltered people.  Blurt it out.  It's so fucking refreshing, no matter who you are.  I guarantee we can get gay guys and fucking lesbians on the phone saying they like their  shit unfiltered, too.  Yeah.  And sometimes, as a result, I really...  I say really stupid shit.  He does.  Yes.  But that's fucking entertaining as all hell. 
[00:34:00]  I never thought you'd realize that.  Yeah, I didn't either.  Geez, wow.  That's the first time I've ever heard Tracy acknowledge that.  Right.  That's insightful.  Grab that lunchbox, go to work.  Yeah.  Right.  What are you talking about?  I don't know, Jimmy.  Sometimes I say stupid shit.  Didn't Jimmy say it yesterday?  You like being caught by surprise in comedy, right?  Yeah.  That's really important.  Yeah.  It's a big thing.  You're sitting, you're sitting, you're sitting, you're sitting, you're sitting, you go, whoa!  Yeah.  Right?  The only way I think Tracy should apologize, I mean, look, I would have apologized along 
[00:34:30]  with him.  Like, I get why he did it, so I'm not being some phony maverick.  He shouldn't have said he was sorry.  He's got a career, millions of dollars.  I get it.  I would have said I was sorry, too.  I really would have.  I wouldn't have lost the gig over it.  It's not worth it.  Especially for a dumb joke that may not even reflect how you really feel.  Would it be a fake apology?  This is what I say.  I don't know.  If I said something that I really believed, in a joke, and I had to come out and apologize  for it.  Like, if somebody asked me to apologize for the fact that I made fun of Islam, or the  fact that I made fun of race, it would be a very phony apology. 
[00:35:00]  If I said something in like a weird moment on stage, or a tirade, that was vicious, that  I didn't mean at all, that was like, oh, that's not even the way I feel, then maybe  I would.  But either way, if I had Tracy's mistakes he's facing, I would say I was sorry.  Yeah, he was...  I'm not going to pretend I wouldn't.  In agreement, he was going for a joke?  It's hard to say without hearing it.  I would assume...  I would hope he was, but without hearing it, it's really hard both ways.  Because was he saying something?  I could picture him going, my father would shoot him in the head, being silly. 
[00:35:30]  Or was he going, I would shoot the little nigga in the head, like being serious.  I don't know.  So if he was being serious, that's harder to defend, because if you're just coming out  and going like, hey, all kidding aside, folks, if my kid was gay, I'd stab him.  Right.  That's kind of tough fucking to defend.  I hope someone could come up with a tape of me doing this exact joke somewhere else.  Yeah, see what it is.  Because I just have a feeling I've heard that before.  And then if I had a gay son, he went on, I would love him just as much as if he was straight. 
[00:36:00]  I might have to try to love him even more, because I know of the difficulty that he would  have in society.  Wow.  Tracy seems like the type of guy that would love his kid no matter what.  He doesn't seem like you'd care.  Honestly.  That, I feel, is the real Tracy.  Regretful Morgan explained, of all the sicknesses, there's probably none more abusive than homophobia.  My heart is committed to giving everyone the same rights that I deserve for myself.  I don't care if you love the same sex as long as you have the ability to love someone. 
[00:36:30]  I think the worst part of having a, if you had a gay son, would be the fact that when  he's in high school, you wouldn't get those hot girls coming over for the pool party.  Because you hear from fathers all the time going like, oh God, my son's starting to bring  home these girls and they're fucking beautiful.  I don't know what to do.  I'm freaking out.  And you'd just be like, Jesus Christ.  Oh, hi Brad.  Hi Scott.  Wouldn't be bad if they were twinks, but if he liked bears, it'd be like, God, do you  have to bring home the fucking, he's a linebacker.  Where's the cabana? 
[00:37:00]  Couldn't you like slender guys?  I said, I said the worst part would be having to go to some weird pizza party.  You know what I mean?  Because now you've got to kind of be accepting and kind of show up.  Oh, there it is.  I mean, obviously for a dad, it would be a little awkward.  You know, that's that you could say without any repercussions because it probably is very  awkward.  I think, from a selfish point of view, yeah.  Just missing out on those fucking nubile bodies in bikinis jumping in your fucking backyard 
[00:37:30]  pool.  Wow.  I think every father that has a son, I really, there's a blanket statement, but it's in the  back of your mind.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean.  Would I be accepting?  Abso-fucking-lutely.  But you're sitting there, I'm already looking for signs, like, I'm not, that's just how  it is to be a father.  Yeah, that to me.  You're not going to change that in me.  Is real, realistic.  Can I be accepting if it turns out?  Yes. 
[00:38:00]  But right, I'm already looking like, all right, he's not picking up any dolls yet.  Let's see.  Does he go for the sneakers or the high heels?  Yes.  Playing with the parents' shoes.  Let's see.  Yay, the sneakers.  He went with the sneakers.  And Tracy took that thought that pretty much every father has, pretty much, I'm sure  somebody will call it.  Took it to the umpteenth level.  Yes.  Yes, but you really think that shit.  But I would think, yeah, I would think fathers, and seeing how much comedy is made, and it's  allowed, if it's very basic like that, about fathers and gay sons and how they're dealing 
[00:38:30]  with it, and what they got to do in the awkward moments, because that is, that does make for  funny comedy.  Um, I, I think that is kind of an accepted thing, that yes, the father will be uncomfortable.  The family will have to go through certain things, and, and, uh, mentally, um, to, to  deal with the situation.  But, you know, and then you can take Tracy, and it's like, stab him in the chest, or shoot  him in the head.  All right, that's taking it way to the, to the edge of the, the level. 
[00:39:00]  But, how was he saying it?  It really is a difference, and it's funny, on Red Eye last night, the woman, one of the  women who I was, I was on with, uh, she was nice, but she was saying something about how,  like, great comedians always know where the line is, and I said, but I, but I, but that  to me is such a common misconception.  Yeah, they don't.  And I said, I was, I was like, Richard Pryor and Carlin lived over the line.  Kennison was a genius, he lived on the other side of the line.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Bill Cosby does not, Seinfeld does not, they're also great comics. 
[00:39:30]  You don't have to, but don't say because somebody does, that they don't understand what great  comedy, that, that, but that's, that thought right there, sums up what so many people feel  about comedy.  Well, a great comedian doesn't need to use that kind of line.  Mm-hmm.  It doesn't have to be anti-gay, it could be just, you're pussy jokes.  Right.  Oh, a good comedian, people always have this thing, a good comedian, dot, dot, dot.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  They always have, and you, how about you just love Brian Regan, and you love Otto and George.  Can't you just love both of them, instead of fucking finding out why one is more valid 
[00:40:00]  than the other?  It's so frustrating.  Right.  They're both very important, as far as...  Trust me nuts.  ...wanting to laugh.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Uh, the comedian continued by speaking out against the controversial don't ask, don't tell  policy that Congress repeated last year, saying they got him for everything.  They repealed it last year, right?  Uh, yeah.  You should have the right, no matter who you are, to protect and serve our country.  So they gave him a whole list of things, we want you, because, because, Glad knows everyone's  going to pick this, uh, this up.  Yeah.  I mean, they're going to get a lot of, a lot of info out there.  That's exactly, dude, what you just said right there, is exactly... 
[00:40:30]  So they're holding him hostage, that's why I'm...  Yeah.  Every case is exactly what you just said.  They know it's going to be picked up.  Right.  They say, this person says it, everyone picks it up.  So, Tracy Morgan, just to summarize, he apologizes for something that might have offended some  people.  It should have ended there, even though I don't even agree, he should apologize.  But then they grab you, they hold you hostage, and they basically give you  a whole bunch of bullet points to comment on, and then, guess what?  The mainstream media and everyone just picks it up.  What they say is, look, we'll allow you to keep your career, we'd like to borrow you and 
[00:41:00]  use you as a bullhorn, for a few days if we can.  That's perfect.  Do you mind if we use you as a bullhorn?  Yeah, yeah.  But they, it's, how could, as people with so many different ideologies, whether it's  gays or racist or, or, or women's groups or Catholicism or Islam, how can every one of  them behave exactly the same way?  Every...  That is amazing.  That is one thing that all societies agree on.  When someone fucks up, use them as a bullhorn for what you'd like them to say.  No matter what the group is, you're right.  They all do it.  Because I'm sure GLAAD is putting out these statements almost on a regular basis, but no  one's picking it up. 
[00:41:30]  No one hears it until someone fucks up.  Until someone fucks up, and then they're like, oh, now we get to really be heard.  It's almost like a heckle.  They have silence in the room, and they're the one who wants to yell out, bullshit, while the  comedian's on.  You know, you brought up Seinfeld, clean comedian, Seinfeld, known as a clean comedian  and stuff like that.  I was watching an episode last night, it was the suicide, it was about this guy, was in  a coma, trying to commit suicide, because it was a chick, wanting to leave him and stuff.  And there were so many suicide jokes being made, and Jerry was saying a few, it's like, 
[00:42:00]  what is that with the...  They were talking about Dr. Kevorkian, and he goes, what's with the suicide machine?  Aren't there any tall buildings around still?  He goes, why can't people just wrap their lips around a revolver like everybody...  Like, I mean, and that shit to people that know people that have committed suicide, mental  health things, suicide hotline, things like that, would upset them to the point where  that would make Jerry like, hey, you know, hey, that's over the line. 
[00:42:30]  And then his whole thing at the end, where he does his little stand-up at the end of the  show, was on suicide.  And, you know, it's like, how come people that commit suicide, they try and they fail,  and then they just give up?  Right.  It's like, you know, give it a try.  Keep trying.  If you can't start your car in the garage, get a tune-up.  I would love it.  He goes, get like, he just was going off on killing yourself, and it would have been very  offensive to suicide.  And why is it okay?  I don't know.  We know why it's okay, but why is it okay? 
[00:43:00]  As I was watching that one, too.  Oh, shit, there's a lot of people listening to us right now that have been affected by  suicide.  Absolutely.  Dude, I know of six comedians that have killed themselves.  Yeah.  Six.  Six.  Really?  Six comics.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Wow.  As I was watching that, though, I did realize, I went, you know, this is one I don't really  see that much on television, because it was on DVD.  And I'm like, I don't see this one on TV that much.  And I'm wondering if they just pulled that one, like, eh, we don't have to play that one.  We have enough to play, so why don't we just show off this one? 
[00:43:30]  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, turn it off, eh, eh, turn it off, eh, turn it off, eh, turn it  off, eh, eh, eh, but you do see how it's like, it all depends on who complains, who's  because the suicide, there's no real powerful voice, because no one's defending people's  right to commit suicide.  So there's no suicide voice, if that makes any sense, because they're not being discriminated  against.  So they don't have a special interest group.  It'll just be people piping up here, and they're all willy-nilly.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, and you might not like it, but that's why every single fucking person 
[00:44:00]  listening to our voices today should push back.  Oh, yeah.  Even if you're a gay guy that was offended by what Tracy Morgan said.  Now you're telling gay guys to push back.  Look, Opie, I'm not going to sit here while you make jokes during this sensitive time.  Good point, because we've said on this show, it's only gay if you push back.  Right.  You're right.  No need to get us all lathered out.  Wow.  Oops.  They're pushed back.  Oopsie.  But everyone should be pushing back, because they're never accepted.  Because it's not going to, they're going to go after your little group next, you dummies. 
[00:44:30]  Even if you're offended.  We've been saying that for years.  Yes.  It sucks you're a little offended, but, you know, think of the overall thing here.  You're going to lose some funny shit out there.  To me, that's when people are really fighting for each other's, and it's not as dramatic  as, uh, I'll die if you're right to say it.  It's nothing that melodramatic.  I wonder how many people really mean that.  But, look, I don't agree with what you say, but I'll protect it with my life, you're right  to say it.  It's like, really? 
[00:45:00]  Would you?  I don't think you would.  How about this?  How about a compromise?  I may not agree with what you say, but I won't try to ruin your career for saying it.  Yeah, there you go.  You don't have to throw your own neck out there on the train track.  I'm not going to hang myself.  Yeah.  But I'm not going to hold your head down there, either.  I may not agree with what you say, but go ahead.  Yeah, but go ahead.  That's all I want out of America.  I may not agree with what you say, but I can't say it anyway. 
[00:45:30]  Go ahead.  I'm alive.  You're alive.  Go ahead.  Who was the uninformed woman on Red Eye last night?  I don't know if she was.  That's someone that's uninformed.  I don't know if she was a strategist or whatever.  You don't know what her thing is?  I have not done the show with her, no.  Okay.  But what she said was not, it bothered me, but I wasn't annoyed at her because I've heard  that a million times.  It's a very, very common feeling with comedy.  And I want to take a gamble here is that a lot of the people who are offended, not just  members of GLAAD, but even people who didn't vocalize their offense, are mad at Tracy, are 
[00:46:00]  the same ones that would have said, you're an idiot if you wanted to censor what Robert  Mapplethorpe did as an artist and as a painter, who a lot of people felt was way over the line  and was way offensive.  But Robert Mapplethorpe could say, look, this is why I do this.  This is my art.  And a lot of gay people would absolutely defend him as they should.  But those people will abandon Tracy.  And you know what?  A lot of the blacks defending Tracy, like you said, abandon Imus.  It's this fucking phone.  It's a game of hot potato in this country with free speech. 
[00:46:30]  It is when you're saying something that is bothering me, I'm going to fucking grab the  potato and scream at your face.  Oh, I don't know why you'd hold a potato in her.  The Imus, we obsess about the Imus thing because when the Imus thing was going down, black radio  stations, when it's right, it's right.  This is what happened.  Black radio stations were applauding, jumping up and down.  They were loving it.  What are you, drumming?  And we're sitting there like, you idiots, they're going to go after you next. 
[00:47:00]  You're next, dummy.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  That was, you're absolutely right with Mapplethorpe, though.  A lot of gays would look at that and be like, hey, he's got the right to show his art.  And not only were they defending him, but they were way, way far against people that were  against him.  Like, they were condemning everybody that was against Mapplethorpe.  Saying, oh, you close-minded, fucking, you know, conservative shithead. 
[00:47:30]  And it's like, wait a minute, you're doing the same exact thing when you try to stick  up for what you believe in, and people hate you for it.  Well, like the same people that said that, and I disagreed with Giuliani when he went after  that art in the Brooklyn Museum of Art.  Yeah, what does he know about art?  None of his business.  Right.  When it was painted with dung, but that really meant something to Africans.  That wasn't some slam on the Virgin Mary.  Right.  The religious groups got very offended.  I like the dogs playing poker.  That's the one I like. 
[00:48:00]  Did he say that?  No, but that would be funny.  I still have.  He should.  I have a hangout in the Greatly Mansion.  But people said, I guarantee you that there were not a lot of gay groups that agreed  with him.  They're probably like, oh, you said a conservative asshole.  What are you talking about?  But now it's there.  You're either for it or against it.  I think D.L.  said about, D.L.  Hughley said about, I miss it.  It's a zero-sum game free speech.  And D.L.  is a great example of a guy who kind of shits on everything and who I've never heard complain  about what another guy has said.  That was just a good way to phrase it.  Either you're for everybody saying what they want or you're not. 
[00:48:30]  There's no fucking middle ground.  I know the difference between yelling fire in a movie theater and doing humor.  I know the difference.  And we all know the difference.  Yeah.  I'm battling.  No, you're not.  It gets back to Tracy.  So Morgan's deepest apologies was aimed at the victims of homophobic bullying who he  reportedly told to stop whining during his heavily criticized act.  Stop whining.  You've been in a million comedy clubs.  How many people went, oh, you think?  Don't know because I don't know what his fan base is now. 
[00:49:00]  I'd say 10, 15 years ago, it was his Tracy.  But he attracts, Tracy gets a lot of walkouts on stage because he's harsh.  And he's got a lot of 30 rock people.  A lot of 30 rock people.  A lot of movie people.  Love them in cop-out.  Oh, that's true.  So his fan base is not what it was.  They're a little bit more mainstream now.  Double-edged sword, that whole thing.  You get the popularity.  You're selling a lot of tickets.  But then you've got to deal with the people that are like, ah, who is this guy?  What I am most sad about is the comments I made about kids and bullying.  This is the last statement. 
[00:49:30]  He said, I would never want any young person to think that I wasn't on their side.  And if any young person thinks they can bully a young kid, come see me at 30 rock.  On the corner.  I'd be happy to meet you.  That'd be fun.  Or Brooklyn, if you can't make it to Manhattan.  So we understand why he's going through all this.  But it's unfortunate that we as a society are making people do this.  But if that's the way he really feels, as a comic, I would say, well, then shame on you.  You should fucking shame on you.  But you should convey that in your act.  Like Nana. 
[00:50:00]  But you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Tracy's a funny enough guy.  If that's how you really feel, you should kind of be conveying that in your act.  It's like Bill Cosby, who I think is brilliant.  And Cosby does all this family value stuff, but he has a lot of very harsh opinions on race.  And on black people talking a certain way.  You can't be a doctor talking like...  Yeah, yeah.  He should convey that on stage.  Not necessarily just when off stage.  Fucking bring that on stage.  Right.  You could do that and be clean.  People just like my filth-flarn, filth-flarn bits.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Very filth and flarn.  Who's he putting?  Ugh, right.  Does he have a book coming out?  We're trying to get Bill Cosby.  I'd love to get him to see that.  Does he?  Really?  Yeah.  You know, weird guy.  I told you me and my girlfriend went to see him in the fucking Borgata.  He just brought us backstage and talked for a half hour.  And another couple came in.  Oh, shut up, Bill.  I was like, all right, Bill, I'm going to watch the show.  Oh, you are the show.  Oh, I just wanted a picture with you, Bill.  Jesus.  Now I'm stuck here with you.  But he was so fucking interesting, dude.  He was a really...  I would imagine he would be.  Yeah.  He's had a fucking life and a career, man.  Fuck yeah, man. 
[00:51:00]  Pryor used to steal from him.  Very, very interesting guy.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  He wanted to be...  And Pryor said he'd do his room for one, meeting a black guy like that.  And Pryor wanted it to be him.  And he conked his hair.  And he fucking did Cosby-like material on Sullivan.  And it was never quite what Cosby was doing.  Wow.  So then he just became his own person.  He walked off stage.  I think the Aladdin in Vey walked off.  Couldn't handle it anymore.  And he went into the Red Foxes Club and the Black Clubs and Mooney and them.  And he would go all these fucking hardcore black rooms.  And he just...  If you watch Richard Pryor live in Smoke in 1971 at the Improv here in New York, he's bombing. 
[00:51:30]  He's bombing because the audience is not ready for it.  But it's really great.  He's smoking and he's just got all this fucking...  He's talking about black militants.  And no one talked about that in 71.  Except in black clubs.  And he was filming it.  And he was like...  He was complaining that it wasn't getting the laughs.  But 10 years later, they released it.  They didn't really...  It did so poorly.  But he admits sucking a dick.  He admits...  And he had sex with a gay guy.  He's like, I fucked a faggot. 
[00:52:00]  He said, never fuck a faggot because they will tell.  He admitted that.  It was harsh to say like that.  But Pryor admitted that in 1971.  Wow.  Damn.  Yeah, that's probably not going to get...  That's probably going to get a lot of people just staring.  Oh, dude.  Blankly and scared.  It's the fucking...  I'm uncomfortable with that.  Talked about his mother being a hooker.  The greatest fuck...  It's my favorite stand-up.  Even though it didn't...  Damn.  You watched it 10 years later, what it became.  What was it called?  Richard Pryor, Live and Smoking. 
[00:52:30]  And he bombed...  It's like 35 minutes.  I'm going to check it out.  It's at the Improv here in New York.  Live and Smoking.  I do remember when that came out.  That was much later.  It came out in 81.  81.  After Live and Concert had been released in 79 or 80.  And I might have even been after Sunset Strip.  Damn.  But he's just...  Oh, he's so great just standing there.  All these fucking amazing thoughts.  And I know how they turned out three years later on records.  I know the way the bits became.  It's fucking great.  Right on.  Sorry.  All right.  We should take a break.  We started with a million things and then went with Tracy Morgan. 
[00:53:00]  I'm glad we did that.  But we got the Wiener thing with Obama commenting on Wiener.  I had another odd dream.  Oh, no.  Can we save it for after the break?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got to eat.  Was it about Wiener?  Well, not...  No, I don't think so.  But I'll tell you after.  You know what?  And I'm not trying to attach myself to what you just said.  But I had an odd dream to...  Did you have an odd dream?  And I don't have a lot of odd dreams.  I think I became Jimmy in my dream. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, jeez.  But I mean...  Really?  Yeah.  Do you find you like certain things you didn't think you'd like?  No, not that bad.  I became a picture-taking idiot.  Oh, you did?  I might want to rephrase that as a guy who likes pictures.  Oh, sorry.  I became a guy who likes photos.  Sorry.  How about a sweet guy who enjoys a photo now and again?  Now and again.  I became a fucking closet queer who enjoys pictures and has no chin and fat tits.  No offense, Jimmy.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's accurate.  I didn't say that wrong. 
[00:54:00]  I didn't say that wrong.  A picture-taking idiot.  I became a zilch.  You know, this isn't fair because you said you have a dream, so mine's quick.  I was obsessing with taking a picture with Jack Nicholson.  Oh, well, that would be...  At some weird...  I don't even know where the fuck I was, and he was trying to hide, and I kept stalking him  until I got a picture.  Wow.  And he was, like, crouched down on a curb hiding behind a guy.  It was some kind of, like, obscure film festival or something that I just happened to.  Yeah, it's some kind of thing.  Jimmy thing.  But I wasn't invited there.  I just happened to be, like, on vacation or something, and I just happened to be in the 
[00:54:30]  area where this big, huge thing was going on.  I didn't think much of myself that I would actually be invited.  I just happened to be there.  And now I'm like, holy shit, that's Jack Nicholson.  I got to get a picture.  I got to get a picture.  And I was obsessing about it.  And it was the Jack Nicholson from The Shining.  It was a current day...  Oh, wow.  The good, older Jack.  It was a current day Jack.  Or younger Jack.  And then finally I got a picture as he turned to look at me with those evil fucking shining  eyes of his, all pissed off.  And then all of a sudden my alarm went off. 
[00:55:00]  I'm like, fuck, I want to know what happened.  I hate that when you have to wake up.  Yeah, it sounds so cool.  But the wake up is the only reason why you remember the dream in the first place.  Although I'm glad I woke up from last night's one.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I wanted no more of that.  Here's Johnny.  I'm doing some impressions, by the way.  I'll be doing them tomorrow night at the Antisocial Comedy Tour.  I close with a good Nicholson.  I say, picture Jack Nicholson if he were Anthony Wiener.  And I go, had you like to see my Wiener? 
[00:55:30]  Here's my Wiener.  That is good.  Wendy, here's my underwear.  I do a whole rant on Nicholson.  It's so good.  I can't wait to check that out.  I'm the Joker in the Batman.  Here's my Wiener.  It is like it.  Oh, okay.  Sure it is.  Hey, are you guys here in a cuckoo's nest of Wieners?  Ah, see, you add in the movie names so people really drive it home. 
[00:56:00]  Nice.  I played the Wolfman.  Harry liked the Wolf Wiener.  Here's Johnny.  Here's my dick.  Here's my dick.  Hey, am I leaking gas or is someone having fucking eggs?  I have eggs.  And hopefully you're leaking gas so we can get our food and our heart-ons together.  I was getting a little nervous there.  All right.  You're eating eggs.  Good.  All right.  Anthony's Dream next.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  It's not the same like it was. 
[00:56:30]  Erectile dysfunction has become a serious epidemic.  Pussy is over.  Don't mean nothing no more.  I can't get a heart on.  Take it from legendary comedian and ED sufferer Pat Cooper.  It's no joke.  I'm not making this shit up.  You're with that gorgeous muffa and you're in bed and it don't happen.  Happened to me.  And she goes, what's the matter?  I said, I think it's erectile dysfunction.  She goes, what's that?  I'm fucking dead.  She goes, you mean you can't get it up?  Medication isn't the only option. 
[00:57:00]  I tried Cialis.  I tried Viagra.  I tried everything.  I'm fucking dead.  If you or someone you know is suffering from erectile dysfunction, contact your physician to explore alternative medical treatments.  I swear to you, I went to a urologist.  He says, how do you feel?  I said, my big thrill is peeing.  I said, when I was getting laid, I said, go, ah, ah.  Now that I pee, I go, ah, ah, ah.  It's the same fucking thing.  It wouldn't have cost me a dime.  Just take it from Pat Cooper.  Don't buy into the erectile dysfunction hype. 
[00:57:30]  Fuck all the bullshit.  Your penis no longer works.  Life as you know it is over.  The doctor said to me, you're fucking dead.  I'm fucking dead.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  How does it feel?  How does it feel?  To be without a home?  Like a complete unknown. 
[00:58:00]  Like a rolling stone.  Is this a coming back from the first break, thematic reason why this song is playing thing?  Because that's become kind of a thing, I noticed.  Well, it's 46 years ago today that Bob Dylan recorded this little ditty. 
[00:58:30]  Dylan, thumbs up or down?  Sometimes thumbs up, sometimes thumbs way down.  Why sometimes way down?  I don't know.  I like the stuff where it's pseudo-melodic like this.  I don't mind this.  Like subterranean homesick blues?  No.  You don't like that?  Not really.  You're a tough guy.  Yeah.  I like Bob Dylan.  I even like that dumb one where it doesn't sound like him at all.  Lady, lady, lady.  Lay across my big breast bed. 
[00:59:00]  It doesn't sound like him at all.  It's pretty weird that that sound.  And his voice gets all weird.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't mind.  I like Dylan.  But sometimes where he's just going, I'm like, I can't take it.  Well, that's live Dylan.  Get me out of here.  Live Dylan.  No, thank you.  I'm done with that.  I like him.  I have a, what do I like a lot?  The House of the Rising.  Sound like his version of that?  He does a version of that, yeah. 
[00:59:30]  I think he wrote the motherfucker.  I think he did, yeah.  I think it's his song.  Did he write that?  I'm pretty sure he did.  That's all right.  Something happened the other day with Bill Burr.  He tweeted, he goes, Neil Diamond is doing a cover of Red, Red Wine.  And it was good up to the part where he's got to like talk or something.  And I just wrote, Bill, he wrote the fucking song.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Neil Diamond wrote Red, Red, Red Wine.  That's his fucking song.  I didn't know that.  But it's funny when you think like, he did a cover of this and it blows. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  It's like, oh, he wrote the motherfucker.  Well, I think that happens a lot.  Yeah, like Bobby McGee.  Well, these artists, they go, ah, here, you can have this song.  And then it becomes a huge hit.  And they're like, wait, I wrote that.  So they want to make it a hit themselves.  It's like, nah, you're now just doing a cover of the original.  Chris Christopherson, I think, did Bobby McGee.  Yeah, he wrote that.  No.  Yes, he did.  Yeah, Chris Christopherson wrote Bobby McGee.  Why don't I know any of this shit?  Isn't that sick?  And the original, I Will Always Love You, Dolly Parton, great tune that Whitney made a huge 
[01:00:30]  of.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I prefer Dolly's version, actually.  Wait, who wrote that?  Dolly Parton.  Dolly.  Did I know?  I'll always love you.  And I.  As she's sweating like a pig.  Boy, can she sweat.  Yeah, well, if you're on.  Well.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah.  I want to hear House of the Rising Sun by Dylan.  Origins of House of the Rising Sun?  Yeah, I didn't think Dylan wrote that, man.  Dates back to 1933.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know that.  But he does a version of it. 
[01:01:00]  I think Hitler used to sing that.  The old fucking beer halls.  Oh, help me out.  One of the old blues artists.  I heard House of the Rising Sun.  Hold on, hold on.  Pause this for a second.  Lead Belly?  Maybe.  Somebody that knows the blues.  There was a blues album I picked up.  I haven't fucking checked out in many, many years.  And there is a version of House of the Rising Sun on there, but it's almost sideways.  It's a little twisted.  But you can tell it's what became House of the Rising Sun. 
[01:01:30]  Old Billy Tetley?  Old Bill.  What?  It could have been Bill Tetley, yeah.  Fuck.  Any help on that one, Ant?  No.  I want to say Lead Belly, because I got obsessed with Lead Belly for a while.  Oh.  This is Lead Belly.  Rising Sun Blues.  This might be it right here.  Oh, God.  That sounds like Lead Belly guitar.  There is a house in New Orleans.  Wow. 
[01:02:00]  They call the Rising Sun.  Damn, he must have made a lot of money from this song.  Oops.  And we have got one.  I like Lead Belly.  Rising Sun Blues, huh?  Please don't do like I have done.  It's pretty much the same song.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The house in New Orleans.  They call the Rising Sun. 
[01:02:30]  If I had listened at what my mama said, I would not been here today.  See, to be so young, so foolish and so wise,  I let her ramble all leave me straight.  Sold the song for some pork and beans.  You know what?  It probably was.  Probably.  And an old dog or something.  Good old heady Leadbetter. 
[01:03:00]  We done with this?  It only has one more verse.  I like this.  It's all right, right?  Fuck yeah, man.  Yeah, I got obsessed with Lead Belly for a little bit.  I'm going back to turn you all in.  My race is almost run.  I'm going back to spend the rest of my life.  I'm going to need a ride in the sun.  Well, his songs are all short, too. 
[01:03:30]  Good Night, Irene, I think is his.  Fucking, there's so many songs.  He actually influenced Anal Cunt on the length of their songs.  That was fun yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what that sounded like out there.  That's a pisser.  You know what?  So Lead Belly, you know, and then he gets ripped off there.  But the Animals version of that song is so fucking great, right?  Yeah.  I don't think that's a great sounding song.  I like that.  I like Dylan's version, too, man.  It's cool because it's dirty and old and all that crap.  But it's not, it doesn't sound like the Animals, man, where you get into that shit. 
[01:04:00]  How does the Animals sound?  I just want a moment of it.  I don't know if I like Dylan's, but.  Yeah, this is great.  This is fucking great.  Yeah.  And look, they look like the Beatles when they sing it.  Yeah.  The video's hysterical.  This is how a bunch of white boys do it.  It is good. 
[01:04:30]  It's like Jimmy Fallon.  He was one fucked up individual.  Who was that?  Ah, what the fuck's his name?  Yeah.  Eric Burden.  Look at this horrible video.  Now all the guitar players are walking off screen one by one.  They're all wearing ties.  Terrible lip syncing.  Yeah.  Put on Dylan's.  I think the Animals is better.  But listen to Bob Dylan's version.  I do like it.  There's a house down in New Orleans. 
[01:05:00]  There's a house down in New Orleans.  People did this.  They call the Rides.  It's doing more like Lead Belly a little bit, right?  Yeah, I like this version a lot.  I like this too, Jerry.  I don't think I've ever heard this.  You can barely hear his vocals.  Of many poor girls.  It's in the left ear.  Is your left ear done?  Is your left ear done?  Oh my God.  Yeah.  It's hard to hear.  Did he get smashed in the head with a kettlebell? 
[01:05:30]  Wait.  He's not right there.  My mother was a tailor.  You can't hear his vocals.  Wait.  She sold these new blue jeans.  It's so low.  It does sound low.  My sweetheart was a gambler long time down.  This is out of phase.  You're not deaf.  I thought I had a problem.  You're not deaf. 
[01:06:00]  I thought I had some kind of a tumor on my cock.  I just put Ant's headphones on and you can't hear the vocals with his headphones.  I wonder what the deal is.  It's extremely, extremely low in the background.  Very low.  I thought we just found out that you're missing an ear.  I'm a might bit deep.  That's a terrible version.  That's Eric Burton now?  Wow.  He don't look like that kid no more.  Why does it sound so bad?  Is it a regular?  That's not the good version of it.  That's the copy that's in the light here. 
[01:06:30]  Okay.  Why is it coming in one ear?  Hey, fuck you, Jimmy.  That's what he just said.  No, he's right, though.  I only got in one ear.  Yeah, it's out of phase or something.  Yeah, I like it.  So Dylan recorded Like a Rolling Stone 46 years ago today.  That's why that.  And speaking of the...  Do you like his version of All Along the Watchtower?  Which I know he wrote.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's a perfect example that I bet you he wishes he never gave that one to Hendrix.  That thing is a fucking monster for Hendrix.  Oh, wait.  My phones weren't plugged in all the way. 
[01:07:00]  Hold on, hold on.  You want to hear it again?  Yeah, just put it on real quick.  No, you're not deaf, though.  Let me see.  How about hurry up and put it on?  Lollygagging.  There is a house where I live.  Let's hear it.  Oh, Christ.  Blazing.  Now you can hear it?  Yeah.  All right.  That makes sense. 
[01:07:30]  What a dickbag I am.  Oh, yeah.  And it's me.  And it's me.  Of many more.  Does Dylan still do his radio hour?  Hey, this is Bob Dylan Radio Hour.  Oh, this is L.A. Radio.  What happened with that deal?  That's what this XM was made for.  That Dylan show was great.  It was probably a three-month, $80 billion deal. 
[01:08:00]  If my house was in the rise of the sun, I would probably only want to go there in the shade.  Get an awning.  What the fuck?  Looks at me all angry.  Only if you're tired.  I saw an awning.  No, yawning.  I still can't get our channel in my new car.  And it's too much of a hassle to work it out.  Yeah, I can't get it in my Mustang.  So I decided just not to have our channel in my car.  Me either.  And the live feed or the feed, the internet feed goes out every day.  It's like clockwork.  But every other channel works. 
[01:08:30]  Wow, you know what?  Let me do this for you right now.  Oh, you don't have to.  I went through it.  Nope.  It was a thousand tweets.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I want to acknowledge everyone that tweeted us about the online feed going out.  Read them.  And this is what I wrote.  Thanks for letting me know online feed is down.  Told the bosses, bosses in quotations, who will fix it in quotations.  And say that it's not an ongoing problem, even though I know it is.  That's what I tweeted, right?  Here's the second half of that. 
[01:09:00]  So I get an email from the boss.  Remember what I just wrote, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  That's the audible problem.  There's an audible problem, too.  Nope.  That's an audible problem.  Is the stock market shit in the bed right now a little bit?  Oh.  Yeah, we're below 12,000.  Here it is.  Oh, what happened?  So you heard my tweet, and this is what I get back from. 
[01:09:30]  Quotations.  The boss.  The boss.  I got audio when I tuned in, but have called engineering and the web team to find out if  there was an issue.  If there was an issue.  I'm like, no, there was an issue.  There was.  I'm telling you there was an issue.  Our fans are telling us there's an issue.  Don't say if there's an issue.  I'm going to give out their email so they deal with this.  Oh, that'll be good.  Because every time the online feed goes out, it blows up all our Twitters.  Yeah.  And then I tell these people, and they don't think it's a problem.  There's something going on.  We're going to see if there's a problem. 
[01:10:00]  No, there's a fucking problem.  Supposedly yesterday, we were the only channel that wasn't on.  It's always that.  It was dead air.  When it goes out, it's always just our channel.  I never fucking go to tune into, you know, fucking lithium or the 80s channel or anything  like that.  And it's like, oh, look, it's dead.  Nothing's playing.  But our dumb channel, all the time.  The online feed, I get so many complaints about.  Yeah.  Can I say this?  The web, whatever's going on with the web team here, it stinks. 
[01:10:30]  It stinks.  I don't want to say this.  How do we have satellites circling the Earth, but they can't get the online shit right?  Yeah, the online shit.  Well, I want to write this down.  How about you fix it?  Or you fire who can't, Mars?  Kidding.  I don't know if it's Mars.  I just want them out.  This is what I wonder, but I don't want to say it out loud.  No? 
[01:11:00]  Well, what does that have to do with our feed networking?  Then fair enough.  Then it's definitely a problem.  Yeah, it's a huge problem.  All right.  Well, whatever.  I'm sure they're working on that like they're working on getting us interns.  Oh, wait.  We got an answer here, maybe.  Answer man.  Hi, Mars.  Hi, Mars.  Hi, Jim.  Thanks for your thoughts, but it has nothing to do with me.  I was hoping it would be your responsibility.  It's a third-party company that takes care of that.  Oh, they stink.  Not much of a party.  They stink.  Why is it only our channel?  Or so it seems, according to a lot of listeners. 
[01:11:30]  I didn't know it was only our channel.  I thought it was, I only take care of our channel.  I don't give a fuck about the other channel.  Wait, so they farm it out to a third party?  Yes, sir.  Why don't they do their own fucking internet stuff?  Yes, I'm working on it.  Yes, this is serious.  The feed's down again.  I'm trying to put a logo on sound.  Well, actually, I was talking about the BlackBerrys and the iPhones, the online feed.  I really don't know who takes care of that.  I guess it's the web team. 
[01:12:00]  Well, thanks for coming in.  Exactly.  Clearing that up.  Exactly.  We've really had it a lot, Mars.  I'd love to get that minute back.  But when the...  Oh, wait a buck.  Jimmy farted for 30 seconds.  But when people tweet, they should tell you where the problem lies, not just...  How about they tweet you at all that?  Exactly.  Well, they're not going to assess the problem and troubleshoot it.  They're going to say, I tuned into the online feed and nothing's coming out.  As a customer, it's not their responsibility to troubleshoot.  I know, but when we get the trouble calls, we don't know if it's the iPhone or the BlackBerry or the online feed. 
[01:12:30]  It's every online feed that they have.  I would assume with the volume of people complaining that it's across the board...  It's everything except one particular phone.  Yeah, what's coming out of their satellite radio that they bought.  Well, why don't we talk to our listeners for a second?  You guys got to troubleshoot the problem.  Yeah, troubleshoot it.  Please.  Could you do that?  Could you run a diagnostic on the entire system and then send it personally to Mars?  And acknowledge the SiriusXM flowchart, which is now hanging proudly on our door. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  Love the flowchart.  Do we have a problem?  Yes.  Or is it the other thing?  Did we do good?  I don't remember.  I like the arrow.  See, I did it the other way.  What the fuck is that about?  Sam put up, fire this guy with an arrow pointing.  And as I look at the monitor, the arrow's pointing at Mars.  That's correct.  He got the old...  Just because you want the listeners to troubleshoot the problem.  Well, if they're already complaining, they should add a little step and just say what platform they're complaining from.  That's true. 
[01:13:30]  I mean, exactly.  It's not true.  It's just a pack of lies.  Of course it's not.  All right.  So the listeners will troubleshoot and they will solve the problem.  What do you want them to do after they troubleshoot the problem?  Yeah.  Fix it.  Run a complete diagnostic and then...  And then you want them to fix it themselves?  Yeah.  Maybe get some tiny tools out and get inside their own phones and try to rewire it or something?  I don't know.  Get their tiny tools out.  Their tiny...  Well, I was thinking...  That's like a...  That's absolutely like someone going to the doctor and saying, I have a pain in my side 
[01:14:00]  and the doctor says, okay, cut yourself open, look for something, and then give me a little  more info.  But cut yourself open with those tiny little tools.  Yes.  Tiny little tools.  Fuck you, Jim.  Little tiny tools.  It's a little Don Ho song.  Tiny tools.  Tiny tools.  We get little...  Oh, God.  I really suck.  I really suck.  Uh, we were doing some wiener thing. 
[01:14:30]  And then we got...  Were we?  Yeah, then we went off-road with the Tracy Morgan.  Oh.  Because the wiener thing is just as ridiculous, because now he's in rehab for sexual addiction.  Well, they're not really saying, right?  They're not saying...  Like, no one really knows what he's doing.  But apparently it's for two weeks?  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  And like...  Two weeks.  Maybe he went to Mars.  Maybe, uh...  They're saying, like, two weeks is long enough for him to get treatment for whatever problem  this is.  Like, what is the problem?  I think it's like you said.  He just... 
[01:15:00]  He's not a marriable guy.  There's no problem.  This is what he wants to be doing.  What's wrong with wanting to do this?  Look at him grabbing that dick.  You know, he wants to do this and be married.  I guess that's obviously the problem.  Yeah.  But now you got Obama saying, look, if it was me, I would resign.  And like I said, if you love him or hate him, you don't want the president talking  about him.  No.  And this should be enough for this guy to now, like...  To just resign.  To step down.  Now you got the president talking about you.  The Democrats are having a closed-door meeting, too, today about him. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  And you know it's not going to be like, well, let's...  I will have him stay.  They're trying to figure out how to get him out of there now, right?  They'll all say, you know, give him a chance.  He's a good guy.  And then they'll get to the last guy and they'll go, well, I take the chance.  But what does it come down to?  Can they run you out of there?  Yeah.  It's a process.  It is, though, right?  So he could stay in there.  He could definitely stay in there, but I think it would be more detrimental to his  career and the Democrats, and he wouldn't look like a team player at all. 
[01:16:00]  But they have to investigate it, though, right?  There's got to be an investigation before they...  Yeah.  Yeah, I think they got enough shit for ethical reasons, and they could throw his ass out  of there.  This guy scares me just because of the look he's making on those pictures.  That's the most bothersome part of this.  Yeah, that's the bitches.  The bitches got to worry.  Yeah, but that look is like a guy trying way too hard to look, what, sexy?  To look mean and sexy and rugged and bad. 
[01:16:30]  He's a geeky Jewish politician, and he just wants to look like a badass, you know?  Grabbing his dick.  Grabbing his dick.  Grabbing his dick.  There he is grabbing his dick.  And, you know, trying to look all heart.  You want heart?  You never was like us.  Here's the Obama thing with that guy with the bad voice.  Obama.  Bobby?  On a day when President Barack Obama traveled to North Carolina to talk about jobs,  he also weighed in on the Twitter scandal that is currently engulfing New York Representative 
[01:17:00]  Anthony Weiner.  Obama said in an interview that will air Tuesday on NBC's Today Show, quote,  I can tell you that if it was me, I would resign.  The House will be in order.  Congress turned to work Monday, but the congressman was not in his office.  I've made some mistakes.  I've acknowledged it.  Instead, after speaking to reporters over the weekend, he has reportedly gone into rehab 
[01:17:30]  at an undisclosed location for a disorder that his office hasn't publicly detailed.  On Capitol Hill, the House Ethics Committee has taken its first step towards what could  become a full-fledged investigation of the scandal if Weiner refuses to resign.  Late Monday, House lawmakers granted his request for a temporary leave of absence from his  congressional duties.  I hate this guy.  Experts say if an ethics investigation does unfold, it could last for months and get extremely 
[01:18:00]  complicated if Weiner decides to mount a full-scale defense.  I faded away like I was in social studies class.  Dude, he's a horrible boy.  He can't keep my attention.  No, he needs the sounds in the background.  That's why.  Who knows?  He's a fucking dullard, just trying to do what he'd learn in broadcast school.  How about you just don't learn the windmill?  That's awful.  My dick!  My dick.  We're forgetting something. 
[01:18:30]  I didn't forget about Anthony's dream.  Oh, yeah, my dream.  I thought you had a nightmare.  A little dream.  It was a nightmare?  Well, you could consider it one, I guess, when you find out where it went.  What happened?  You were chased into a diverse neighborhood?  No, it's...  No, no.  Those are...  Usually the bad guys in my dreams that are trying to do me harm are white guys, which is  very odd, considering my, you know, as people call it, a paranoia. 
[01:19:00]  But, uh, no, this was, uh, more of a sex, sexual type dream, but, um, but it was, uh...  Sorry, Anthony and the Lakers.  It was a...  I was on the floor of the court, and they were all fucking my ass and mouth.  Jimmy, no, that isn't it.  And LeBron tried to put his dick in my mouth and missed.  No, that isn't it.  I was, uh, I was trying to hook up with this girl. 
[01:19:30]  And she was, uh, she was very, uh, very hot.  And, and she was kind of avoiding me.  And, um, at some time during that...  That's called a memory.  No, no, but, well, it is, believe me.  But, uh, this, this was a dream.  And, um, then I noticed I started getting a nosebleed.  And, uh, I don't get nosebleeds.  So I started getting this nosebleed, and it freaked me out a little bit.  And, and I had to back off from, like, talking to the girl and trying to pick her up a little bit. 
[01:20:00]  And then this other hot girl, who may have been her sister.  Much younger sister?  We're talking.  No, I think it was an older sister, as a matter of fact.  I was originally, initially going for the younger sister.  Okay.  So it was her older sister.  Who was three.  They started, uh, uh, talking while I had the nosebleed.  And I overheard them.  And this was the part that just killed me in the dream.  That they were talking about the threesome that they had. 
[01:20:30]  With.  With.  With.  Bobo.  No!  Yes!  What a turn!  Is two chicks.  Two of the girls.  And one I really, really was, like, attracted to.  And wanted to hook up with her and everything.  She got that Bobo dick.  And, and, and, and then in the dream, I'm just thinking, oh my god, wait a minute. 
[01:21:00]  These two beautiful girls, they had a threesome with Bobo.  And then I'm just trying to picture, like, one of them sucking on his fucking gnarled dick.  So small.  And, and, and, and, and, like, like, why would they, why would they fuck him and I'm getting  a problem?  They're working me up to a nosebleed.  No, but they were, they were not interested.  The nosebleed gave me the opportunity to, like, say, oh, hold on, I'll, I'll be right  with you.  And they started talking.  That got me, like, out of, out of range. 
[01:21:30]  They thought I couldn't hear them or something.  And they started talking about their threesome with Bobo.  That guy.  That guy.  Look at Bobo's bag.  What does that mean, that dream?  That's so weird.  That's an odd one, isn't it?  I think, I just think it's a bunch of jumbled people in my head.  I don't know.  We got people that.  A mixer.  A dreamy mixer.  We got people that read dreams.  Maybe somebody.  Yeah, we always have someone that reads these goddamn dreams.  You need one of those dream catchers.  I need a dream catcher in my room? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know about that.  You think that's just the fucking, uh, the, the goose and duck soiree at the Overlook?  Yeah, yeah.  Just kind of a bunch of people mushed.  Just kind of a bunch of things.  It's, you know, the lotto machine, whatever.  People pop up instead of the numbers and they all make a dream.  That is a fucked up dream.  It was fucked up because I was so, uh, like, bummed.  But it was in my dream.  Once I woke up, you know, sometimes you wake up from a dream and you're still, like, you're,  like, bumming out from the dream.  Yeah.  I kind of, I chuckled.  Because it was ridiculously funny. 
[01:22:30]  But in the dream, I was totally like, oh, now even if I was able to hook up with this  girl, she'd, like, fucking been with Bobo and it was just weird and, I don't know.  Bobo.  Bobo gave them both a good tooling, I guess.  No, he didn't, though.  Yeah, he didn't.  What does that mean?  I think that means that Anthony has this fear.  Yeah.  That his nose will bleed and girls he like will fuck a retarded.  That's what, that's exactly what that means.  You know, that's an abstract way of looking at that dream, Jim. 
[01:23:00]  Is this, who's this?  Who's this?  Who is this?  Who is this?  Who is this?  That is a Bobo.  Who's this?  Yeah, Bobo.  This is a Bobo.  What's the name of your dog again?  I got two dogs, Rosie and Mr. Maloonigan.  Mr. Maloonigan.  What the fuck is Mr. Maloonigan?  Yeah, where did the name Mr. Maloonigan come from, Bobo?  I don't know. 
[01:23:30]  My sister came up with the name.  Did Mr. Maloon rape you?  And they said, who's been raping you?  Mr. Maloonigan.  Hey, Bobo, you're a stud in Ant's dreams.  You know that?  Yeah, yeah, I know.  That kind of feels a bit awkward.  Does it?  Yeah.  Why is it awkward?  I don't know.  It just feels weird because I wouldn't expect that.  Yeah, well, I don't know.  I wasn't expecting it either. 
[01:24:00]  That's why it was a surprise, but there were two really hot girls, and apparently you had  had sex with both of these girls at the same time.  A threesome.  I know that surprisingly, because that sounds like a dream, all right.  Dream, all right.  Yeah.  That's like you and Rosie and Mr. Maloonigan, right?  Yeah.  A threesome.  One's tongue in your ass, the other one's lapping at your balls. 
[01:24:30]  I don't know about that, right?  They think your dick is a begging strip?  No, in his dreams, he's actually eating the ass of Mr. Maloonigan, and Rosie is banging  pots and pans and getting on the show.  Stupid dreams.  Mr. Maloonigans.  Yeah, in my dream, you're with two girls, and in real life, you know, you're having sex  with your own brother.  Mm-hmm.  Bobo?  Yeah.  Nah, he's still there.  Now, I gotta know why, you gotta know why your sister named your dog Mr. Maloonigan. 
[01:25:00]  What does Maloonigan mean?  I don't know.  She came up with the name because she says the dog looks like a little Irish man.  An Irish man.  So Maloonigan is like an Irish name?  Yeah, sort of.  Yeah.  And then Mr.?  Yeah.  Like an Irish.  Hey.  All right, that makes sense.  How old is that sister of yours?  No.  My sister is gonna turn 16 in September.  Oh, okay.  How about some nude pics? 
[01:25:30]  Is 16 legal in New York?  No.  Not at all.  Hey, Bobo.  Not under any circumstance.  So Anthony was dreaming that you were having some kind of threesome, preventing him from  having a threesome.  What were you dreaming about last night?  Oh, good one.  Yeah.  I have no freaking clue what I dreamt about.  Well, how about one dream, just so we can make something out of this?  Do you remember one dream you've had?  I don't know.  There was one dream that I was at a party with a bunch of girls in some sort of mansion. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, geez.  And what happened?  Oh, nothing.  I woke up right when I was about to lose the V-card.  The V-card?  Yeah.  I know you're retarded and all, but...  No, no.  He heard that from some fucking rom-com.  Where did you hear that?  V-card.  What rom-com?  Huh?  No, I didn't hear that anywhere. 
[01:26:30]  That's just what I refer to it as.  No, you heard that somewhere, sir.  No, you heard that somewhere.  No, I didn't hear that anywhere.  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  I didn't hear that anywhere.  You're lying, Bobo.  You're lying.  Yeah, I think you're lying about that one.  You heard that from some dumb movie or TV show.  Are you lying?  No, I'm not lying.  I didn't hear that anywhere.  You're full of bunk.  Excuse my language.  Mm-hmm.  The V-card.  So you almost had sex with one of these women in the mansion? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  And then you woke up before you lost your V-card.  Yeah.  V-card.  He woke up and Mr. Maloonigan was fucking rubbing his dirty scoot asshole on his nose.  Mr. Maloonigan had an itchy asshole while Bubba was sleeping.  Mr. Maloonigan.  Yeah.  What kind of dog is Mr. Maloonigan?  He's a snoodle.  Snoodle.  Snoodle.  He's a snoodle.  What's a snoodle?  Snoodles are like those, those are the ones you don't, you're not allergic to, right? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're hypoallergenic.  Hypoallergenic.  He knew the word that I couldn't pronounce.  That's why I said it the way I said it.  They are adorable.  They are cute.  Wow, yeah.  You know how cute Mr. Maloonigan would look with a tire track thrown?  His little eyes blinking at you like, help me and you can't.  Poor Mr. Maloonigan.  Mr. Maloonigan has to live with a retard.  Yeah, of course.  You know how fucking annoyed Mr. Maloonigan is that everybody else gets to go out with  their owners and have, like, listen to interesting things and he's going, oh, guys, fence my V-card. 
[01:28:00]  Hey, hold on the line, Bobo.  We got someone that's going to interpret and stream.  I don't know your name, sir, or who?  Steve the therapist from Connecticut.  Oh, Steve the therapist.  Oh, very good.  I remember you.  Go ahead.  All righty, guys.  It's pretty simple.  Let's look at the generics.  I mean, Anthony is a guy who could pretty much get women that most guys can't.  He's not quite Superman, but he's got the cars. 
[01:28:30]  He's got the house.  And from what you guys have said over the years, he's got a pretty good-sized sausage.  Hey, my personality's nice.  Oh, yeah.  You're a good-looking guy.  Yeah, you're smooth.  Now, in your dream, you're getting cock-blocked by a retard who's got a chewed-up plong.  Are you a – you're a therapist.  Exactly.  Can you talk a little lower so the audience understands you?  You're going way too technical here.  Too medical. 
[01:29:00]  Call him a retard.  That's not going to be good for your business, sir.  Go ahead.  So, basically, what I would interpret this to be is this is what goes on at SiriusXM all the time.  You guys are one of the main shows, and you're constantly getting mistreated by management.  Probably, there was a situation where a show far less successful than you guys got preferential treatment that you guys didn't.  So, right.  Gayle King, Lady Gaga interview. 
[01:29:30]  So, let's say the show represents us.  The hot chick is Sirius, and the shitty show is Bobo's Chewed-Up Dick.  Right, and you got cock-blocked by an inferior colleague at work.  That's a great – I can't believe it.  Great way to look at it.  Wow.  That's a great way to look at it.  I don't know.  I just think I fucking – the lot of machines started throwing people around, and I just ended up – 
[01:30:00]  Well, that's not – that's not – I like how it works.  What dreaming does, according to Freud, is it takes all these unconscious thoughts and throws them at you.  It's just a matter of interpreting them and putting them in their proper way.  Oh, damn.  Why couldn't it just be – I was thinking of, you know, Hot Girls and, I don't know, I kind of got cock-blocked by Bobo for no apparent reason. 
[01:30:30]  Did you say Hot Girls?  Yeah.  In Love?  Hot Girls in Love.  Where's that Loverboy song?  Oh, man.  The reason is, after the evening, guys –  Oh, they should have played that one.  They wanted to play Hot Girls in Love instead of working for the weekend?  That would have been good.  That would have been good, Sam.  You blew it.  I would have wanted to hear that one.  Hot Girls in Love.  Dan, dan, dan.  Big keyboard song.  Steve, the therapist might be on to something.  Thank you, Steve.  Well, Steve, great.  Yes.  Good job, boys.  Take care.  Bobo, anything else?  Because we don't want to spend too much time with you today.  Yeah, all right.  I got a stand-up show upcoming on Thursday, 8 o'clock. 
[01:31:00]  No, you don't.  You have a what?  I'm one of the acts on a stand-up show on Thursday at 8 at Broadway Comedy Club.  Who's using you?  Oh, someone's using you.  Give me a name.  No, I was asked by one of my friends.  Of course you were.  Oh, sorry, Heather.  Sorry, Heather.  I was going to say, who's opening?  Mr. Maloon again?  So Heather got you on the bill? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  One of the comedy shows she's doing?  Yep.  All right.  Fair enough.  I hope someone tapes that.  All right.  I'll make sure someone tapes it.  Because we've got a fine tape of you warming up the crowd before, who was it?  I forgot.  Voss.  Was it Voss?  Rich Voss.  Yeah.  I love these comedy clubs that, it's actually a bunch of.  You should play that.  Yeah, that was a good one.  I love the comedy clubs where you're walking around Times Square and people are like,  hey, live comedy, live comedy.  And they hand out the little things. 
[01:32:00]  And they're clubs that I've, and I've known quite a few comics over the years.  They're clubs that I've never heard these people ever play at.  You know, the good comics?  And the comics you've never heard of.  Yeah.  And the comics are like, who are these people?  What are those clubs?  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks.  Oh, go ahead, Jimmy.  There's one called, um, Ha Ha.  I think it's the Ha, is that what it's called?  I forget what it's called.  Ha Ha.  Which I'll never, ever, I walked into it after we got thrown off the air in like 2002.  And the guy at the door was a dick to me. 
[01:32:30]  I've never walked back in.  It's on like 46 or something.  What's wrong with him?  I don't know.  He's just a dick.  Um, and then there's one that Jamie Masada used to have, but he doesn't anymore.  It's over Show World.  Mm-hmm.  But I'll never, ever support that club because they wouldn't let me shoot.  I was trying to shoot something like in a peep booth, like for my CD cover.  Mm-hmm.  And they wouldn't allow any cameras in there.  Get off.  So I'll never support that club.  Wait, the comedy club still has, uh, peep booths? 
[01:33:00]  No, well, it's over Show World.  The building is owned by, it's not the comedy club's fault, but.  Oh, I thought Show World, which was an old, like, jerk-off peep show place, was the comedy club.  That would be great.  You know, you fucking have the little peep thing.  It is a little bit.  A comic goes on, starts talking, and then you just stick your dick out and start just choking your cock.  Or the window opens and the waitress, you know, gives you your food that way.  Yeah, yeah.  Here's your chicken fingers.  Here's your crabs, no matter what you order. 
[01:33:30]  With honey mustard.  It's always crabs.  I do believe you wanted honey mustard for your chicken.  Hey, Bobo, get the plug-in for Heather Height.  All right, it's at Broadway Comedy Club at 8 o'clock.  The tickets are $10 at the door.  This Thursday?  Yep, this Thursday.  All right, you call us and let us know how that goes, all right?  He can plug, though.  All right.  And we look forward to another one-man band soon.  All right, no problem.  I was thinking one of these days. 
[01:34:00]  You got a video, the one-man band.  Oh, really?  Do I?  Yeah.  Bye.  Will you shut up?  You guys want to hear?  I'm an adult.  We haven't played this in a while.  Bobo.  Oh, yeah.  It's throwing Rich Voss at the Stress Factory.  This is great.  This is really good.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Come on, everybody.  Come on, my buddy.  Bobo on stage at the Stress Factory.  He's in New Jersey.  But first of all, how many of you here screwed over a stockholder to come here tonight? 
[01:34:30]  Come on.  I know.  I watch CNN.  I know what's been going on.  Well, first, I'd like to introduce to you, you know him from the Opinality Show.  He's the Jew with the right amount of stupidity and the horse of a smile.  Give it up for New Jersey's own Rich Voss.  The horse of a smile.  And then he won't leave the stage.  So, as a friend here, you know him from the Opinality Show. 
[01:35:00]  All the way from Queen here.  Another retard.  We can get your hands together for the one and only.  Bobo, everybody.  Let him hear it.  Nice shirt there.  Now this is the late show.  Him going up before Voss.  Nice feeling.  Come on.  Good evening, New Jersey.  All right.  Who's here from Queens?  Who do we got here from Queens?  Oh, we got my relatives here.  We got my cousin, Mikey, who's from Queens, who grew up in the same neighborhood as me.  He's now in Smith Temple, Violet. 
[01:35:30]  He managed to make it out here from the shitty L.A.E. traffic along with, let's see, we got  here my Aunt Pura and my uncle Willie from Flushing.  He made it out of your shitty traffic on the L.A.E.  Believe me, it's shitty.  Those of you who don't know the Long Island Expressway, it's very shitty.  The traffic, the traffic I mean.  It's like, who here came out here to screw up the, who screwed over a stockholder? 
[01:36:00]  Oh, we got one that screwed over a stockholder.  I think you're probably going to end up having to get that anal rape by Brain Madoff.  Who's Brain Madoff?  A lot of people know I do that with the Bobo Springsteen bit, so who here is from Jersey?  I can understand Madoff with his brain, but.  Let me see.  Let me see, who's got a good job?  What an adult. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, that was a good one.  Who's got a good job?  Why is he still on stage?  Without further ado, give it up for the guy who has the right amount of stupidity and has a horse-like smile, New Jersey's own Rich Foss. 
[01:37:00]  A horse-like smile.  A horse-like smile.  He wasn't really as bad as I thought he was.  Oh, no, he's got the confidence there, because he's too stooped to know he stinks.  Madoff with his brain.  By the way, we have another, a new flow chart.  Yeah, yeah.  It almost distracted me out of your dream thing, because Danny walked us into the middle of that, and I just lost it.  Well, the original flow chart, what does it say?  What does it say, Sam, again?  It says, uh, let me grab it. 
[01:37:30]  The top box.  Did we do good or something like that?  Yes.  Did we do good?  Did we do good?  So then the flow chart goes to two, um, two choices after that, yes or no.  Yeah.  Right.  And then you pick either yes or no, you did good, and then there's only one choice after that, we have a problem.  Right.  We have a problem.  So now we got a new one.  Does the online, online, online feed work?  And then it's either yes or no.  Yeah.  A lot of people said no, so let's go with no this time around. 
[01:38:00]  So that means it goes down to cool.  Cool.  And then it's, does the online feed work?  Yes.  Cool.  They're all diamond shaped.  Right.  All these flow charts are diamond shaped.  Box at the top, box on the bottom, yes or no in between.  Cool.  So that's the new one.  I love the serious flow charts.  They did exactly what I said they would do yesterday.  I even tweeted.  I said, look, they will tell me there's not really an issue here.  We don't see an issue.  Really?  It's just the same 8,000 people.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  Complaining.  It's a joke.  They're actually joking.  They actually wrote me back and said, when I turn it on, it's working fine.  Yeah.  But we'll, we'll, we'll get with the web team.  All right.  By the way, did the liquid metal host die?  Someone is tweeting that somebody died.  That's what I heard.  Yeah.  I don't think we knew him.  Mario, uh, uh, Comisonis.  Is that how you say it?  Comisonis?  I don't know him.  Troy, do you know him?  Yeah.  Troy said he.  I'm reading this on Troy.  Yeah.  Troy, uh, told us before the show. 
[01:39:00]  He knew him.  Cool guy.  31.  31.  Yeah.  Young kid.  What happened, Troy?  What happened, man?  I'm not sure of the exact details.  I just found out last night.  I got a text message, but, um, yeah, he passed away yesterday.  It was, it was quite sudden from my understanding.  I don't think I knew him.  When did he work?  When was his shift?  Uh, he was on 9 PM till 3 AM Monday through Friday.  And then he did a weekend shift.  Oh, he had a lot, a lot of airtime.  He's a big, big DJ on, uh, liquid metal. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's been with it, with liquid metal for years, you know, when it was a heart attack  on, uh, on, uh, serious, but yeah, it's, it's quite sad.  I really don't know too much about it.  Jose must have known him well.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  We all knew him well.  I mean, he was, he was an awesome guy.  I wonder if it was, was it drugs or you don't know?  No.  I don't know why you just said you don't know.  And I'm asking again, do you know?  No, I, I, I believe it was a brain hemorrhage, but I'm not quite sure of the details.  Jesus.  Yeah.  He was a young guy too.  Only like 30 or 31 years old.  I just don't, a brain hemorrhage is a motherfucker because like one, one minute you're fine.  I wonder if you feel that at all. 
[01:40:00]  Or if you're just talking and you're like, dead.  Like, does it work like that when you're talking?  Dead.  You have a bertation.  Yeah.  And then it's over.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah.  I think he was in a coma for a day or two and then it just.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  Wow.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  Sorry to hear that.  That sucks.  Yeah.  People like the, uh, the break you did with us yesterday with, uh, that, uh, anal cut  and all that.  Yeah.  It was fun.  I bring it up because then Sam had, uh, Roland trying to be a lead singer of one of those  bands. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Oh, what the screaming.  I didn't hear this.  Uh, I wasn't listening on the way home, but I, when I went to swim.  I switched over to another station.  I inadvertently hit the, uh, shit, uh, hour and, uh, I caught this part.  Oh, okay.  Before I could hit the button again because I hit some traffic and I couldn't press the  button right away.  So I wound up hearing it.  I gotcha.  Do we have a quick example of what Roland was trying to do?  Yeah.  Troy's.  All right.  Hit it. 
[01:41:00]  That's Troy from yesterday.  Yes.  Fucking Godzilla.  So Sam was trying to get Roland to do exactly that.  Well, Roland started on his own and then we tried to coach him into really making it  sound right.  Didn't quite work.  Okay.  What's wrong?  Nothing.  Are you okay?  Yeah.  You having a burtation?  No, no.  What's the matter?  Something happened?  No. 
[01:41:30]  I'm trying to hold back.  What's the matter?  Oh.  Nothing.  No, no, no.  Hold back about it.  No, no, no.  Let's talk about this.  Yeah, let's get it out.  No, I'm showing responsibility right now.  It's an honest show.  What's the subject?  I'm showing...  Oh, more writing.  Okay, write it down.  I like the writing.  You just saw me stop myself.  Wow.  I just feel like we should get everything off our chests.  It's a lot of writing. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Wow, that is bad.  All right.  Shit.  I'm glad you didn't get that off your chest.  I should just let the dead air just be floating there awkwardly.  I just stopped myself.  So, Roland was attempting to do Troy on your show yesterday. 
[01:42:30]  Yes, he was.  Okay.  Roland, you were saying his screaming scared you.  Yeah.  Wow, Roland's good at it, too.  Good.  Really try to give a scream.  Good.  Oh, my God.  That was his...  A little more.  Oh.  Here's him making a real effort.  Roland is going to do...  I'll try one more.  He's going to throw it.  Don't laugh, because we want this clean.  Roland, go for it.  Oh, my God. 
[01:43:00]  It sounds like a woman.  He really does.  And then one more.  Is that real?  That's it.  I mean, is that real?  Yeah, I really can't, like...  Okay, do it, like, from your real, like, from the bass.  How much to Betsy?  It's got a high voice, I guess.  He's trying to imitate this again, right? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, that's correct.  Yeah.  You have practice, though, right, Troy?  Yeah.  I've been doing it for quite some time.  Doesn't that blow you...  Like, if I did that once, I would ruin my voice for a month.  You have to learn to scream from your stomach.  I scream from my stomach, like, after a night, like, Saturday.  Right into the toilet bowl.  That's from your asshole. 
[01:44:00]  You want some puking over the weekend?  Nah, actually, I didn't.  I think Melissa did.  Wait, I saw you Saturday night.  Oh, is that when she was a little, uh...  Oh, she was looped.  When did she start puking after we left?  No, I think it was until, like, the next day, like, uh...  Like, probably in the afternoon of the next day.  She was kind of cute and, like, whiny.  Like, uh...  She was like...  You know, and Anthony goes, what's wrong? 
[01:44:30]  And he picks her head up, the way they picked Alex's head up in clockwork out of the spaghetti.  He grabs her by the hair and lifts her head.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  She just as and plopped her head back down.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Was there anything worse than dealing with a really bad hangover in the middle of the summer with no air conditioning?  When you woke up, like, on a Sunday?  Wow, that's a vomit fest.  If I...  Remember those?  I need to be like a meat...  I need to be like a fucking carbone.  Oh, God, yeah. 
[01:45:00]  Just frozen.  Carboners.  A real nice, sunny, summer day.  Yeah.  And you have no AC.  That's bad.  And you're dealing with one of those fucking horrendous hangovers.  I need that, I need some water, and then hours later, maybe some grapes.  Really?  Oddly enough, because the whole thing is, you know, wine, just grapes.  Wine will give you the shitty hangovers.  Yeah, wine is a badass hangover.  All right.  Is it?  Yes.  When we get back, Turkey, we're going to do some other things. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, Sex Man.  Godzilla Roar, Cloverfield Roar, and Troy Roar.  Oh, wow.  Really?  I'd like to hear that.  Don't tell us which one, and we'll try to guess.  Obviously, Godzilla.  Oh, really?  I was going to say Troy, too.  Oh.  Damn it.  And?  Troy.  That's a creepy fucking sound. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Can you hear that one again?  That's...  Yeah, that is nasty.  That's a nasty fucking roar, man.  Cloverfield could have been a great movie, man.  Troy Kwan.  They had a hit on their hands.  They had to go with that shaky fucking cam.  Shaky cam.  Blew the whole movie.  And then finally, Troy.  Troy.  Put in that context, it's pretty good. 
[01:46:30]  He does sound like a giant monster.  Could you move around real fast between the three now?  Uh-oh.  Or is that tough to do?  I don't know.  That's tough to do, yeah.  His fingers are a little too big for the buttons.  Yeah.  A little too chubby.  Yeah, fat.  Do we have E-Rock's e-Harmony video that he made?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  I want to hear that before break.  Can you do that, E-Rock, or no?  Yeah, I can do the sounds right now.  All right, go ahead. 
[01:47:00]  Mix them up.  That's some e-veal.  Yeah.  That's all e-veal.  I give the best singing voice to Cloverfield.  The best boneyard producer to Godzilla.  E-Rock was holding back on all of us. 
[01:47:30]  You know the e-Harmony video that's up to, yesterday was up to five and a half million  views.  Yeah.  The girl losing her mind over the cats.  Over cats.  Most of us have either seen or heard it by now, because we played it on our show.  Yeah.  E-Rock made his own e-Harmony video, and we found this.  Wow.  He didn't want us to know about this.  You want to play it?  Unique.  All right.  Hello.  My name is John.  This is my first attempt at an e-Harmony video. 
[01:48:00]  My first attempt online dating, so I'm excited, but I'm nervous at the same time.  So I'm just going to start talking about what I like, and I hope I get some advice.  Let me guess what he likes.  Food and cock.  Those are my guesses.  Stupid Amish beard.  I like big dicks and shoe fly pie.  And go.  A recent Villanova MBA grad, and I love cheeseburgers. 
[01:48:30]  I...  I just love them.  I love cheeseburgers.  Sam's pointing at E-Rock.  Sam.  I just...  I love every kind of cheeseburger.  That's you, E.  This is like the other video.  Yeah, that's why.  I'm sorry.  I just...  I get emotional.  I just...  I want to eat every cheeseburger.  That's you, E.  And I know that's crazy, because I can't eat every cheeseburger, but I want to. 
[01:49:00]  I want to.  Rock, E.  Rock.  I'm sorry.  I get the idea.  Yeah.  Sex man loves cheeseburgers.  Sex man.  That wasn't supposed to get out.  Ooh.  What?  We didn't need that.  Is the virus in here?  Sex.  What?  What are you doing, E.  That bit was bad enough.  You didn't need to, like, make it worse with that.  That's right up there with, uh, just keep it a secret.  Don't tell anyone.  Right. 
[01:49:30]  That wasn't supposed to get out.  That didn't really work.  You think you'd be punished for that?  You should be punished.  For talking out of turn?  I believe the virus should be here after commercial break as punishment for that.  I don't disagree, Sam.  I don't disagree, actually.  I mean, there's so much going on in the news.  The problem is...  Could he do one wiener joke?  That's what I'm saying.  We haven't heard the virus doing wiener material.  You think the virus could do one wiener joke today, Ant?  Ah.  There's been so many.  He just looked at me, and he put his hands up in the air, and he had this evil look  in his eyes, and he mouthed, fuck you. 
[01:50:00]  Well, he's challenging you.  He's saying that he has wiener jokes.  Yep.  There has to be.  There's been so many made.  Right.  The topic is, it's a dick joke, which are some of the easiest jokes to make.  Should we do it now, though?  I think so, yes.  I think you're right.  Iraq, I mean...  The virus.  The virus.  Let's bring in the virus, of course.  We've got to save this bit, because the cheeseburger thing, I had more hope for it.  It didn't really fucking work.  And he piped up, so obviously he wanted to.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he wanted to.  You think so, right? 
[01:50:30]  It seemed that way.  By the way, Heather Haidt did an eHarmony parody video.  It's very funny.  I tweeted it yesterday, if you want to try to find it.  That's the new thing to do, is your eHarmony...  Yeah.  Her take was pretty good on it, too.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Well, he was just walking out.  We've got to get the music.  We've got to get the music, and we've got to intro the virus.  Roll in here like a boulder.  Looking for one punchline is all this is about.  This could either be 10 seconds or fucking...  I think it has gone on as long as 20 minutes to find one fucking punchline. 
[01:51:00]  It's been ponderous and painful.  Jimmy, you want to intro the virus today?  Ladies and gentlemen, coming straight from Lumpsville.  USA.  Lumpsville, USA.  Please welcome the comedy stylings of the virus.  The virus.  Ladies and gentlemen, the virus.  With one punchline.  Yeah, that's all we need.  Why aren't you excited?  Virus is never excited about performing. 
[01:51:30]  He's never excited.  You would think being a comic.  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  Hey, virus.  Hi, guys.  Oh, yeah.  It's been a long time.  It really has been a long time, Sam.  Yeah.  What do you got today, virus and goo?  Virus, you hear, obviously, wow.  Wow, this Wiener, this Anthony Wiener, boy, is he in Dutch for sending some pictures to a girl on the Internet. 
[01:52:00]  He's married.  He's a congressman.  Boy, she might be stepping down.  He might get kicked out.  So much going on with the Wiener story.  Why is Mars in here?  Are you a big fan of the virus?  Yes, you are.  I was a big fan of watching anyone bomb.  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  At least start with, did you hear about?  Yeah.  At least do the setup.  Come on, virus.  Maybe something will pop into your head.  Virus.  Looking for one punchline. 
[01:52:30]  Here he is.  And a go.  Go.  Get there, buddy.  I'll fucking kill you.  Did you hear about more Anthony Wiener pics are out?  We did, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  A lot of pictures out there.  And one punchline.  And your turn.  The pictures.  Here it comes.  We heard about the pictures.  Yeah, we heard about the more Anthony Wiener pictures. 
[01:53:00]  Virus.  Virus.  I don't believe the answers on those second-rate shoes, Virus.  Oh, shit.  We're looking for one punchline.  Start over.  You've got to start up with like a, it's got to be a leader.  You can't just say, did you hear about it?  You need a...  What's the virus in his phone doing?  Start over.  Hi, guys.  Hey, Virus. 
[01:53:30]  What's going on?  Virus.  Did you hear there's more Anthony Wiener pics available online?  Yeah.  We sure have.  You bet.  Yes.  One punchline.  One.  Yes.  Yes.  We heard.  And we're looking forward to hearing more.  Here we go.  Go, Ski.  Let it roll. 
[01:54:00]  One punchline.  Here it is.  Three, two, one, and go.  What?  Nah.  Wow.  It's just, it's anything.  Dick joke.  Wiener dick.  I've never seen anyone focus so hard in my life with nothing to say. 
[01:54:30]  What was the setup again?  Yeah, what?  Yeah, yeah.  Got to go back to the setup.  Too much time in between the setup and the punchline.  Yeah.  Timing.  Oh, boy, timing.  Did you hear?  Yeah.  Did you hear?  Did you hear?  There's more Anthony Wiener picks available online.  Ah, tell us.  Tell us more, virus. 
[01:55:00]  Yes.  Yellum.  Yes, I did.  By the way, a lot of punchlines coming in on the Institute back in Twitter.  Oh, of course.  None from that guy.  Yeah.  This guy writes, that guy made a real dick of himself.  Bit over.  Oh, anything.  That we're doing.  I like that one.  Yeah.  Jay from Huntington.  Doesn't have to be a great joke.  And he's just Jay from Huntington. 
[01:55:30]  He's not the virus.  He's a headliner.  The king of the one-liners.  The virus.  The king of the punchline.  The virus.  And you.  Come on, virus.  You got it.  Let's go, virus.  Everyone's listening, waiting to go to break.  Yeah.  Just waiting on you.  Waiting on you.  Waiting on you.  That's why you got into this business.  Virus.  Wow.  Wiener.  What was the setup? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, you got to go back to the setup.  People are just tuning in.  We got the virus in the middle of a punchline.  Looking for what?  Setup.  Forgot the joke.  Can you at least do the setup?  So we don't sound like idiots.  Did you hear there's more Anthony Wiener pictures available online?  Yeah.  Yeah, Wiener.  Wiener take photos.  Wiener take, cock.  Let's hear a funny thought with that. 
[01:56:30]  Go.  Fuck you.  There's a heckler out there.  I'll help you out.  Three, two, one.  You're on.  I'll help you.  That's real help.  Huh?  Go for it, big guy.  Honeydew Wilkins is making a request from Oklahoma City, because I know he's just sitting there  doing nothing over there.  So we got to fill up the time.  Can the virus end his jokes with ham sandwich? 
[01:57:00]  Come on.  Ham burn.  Oh, he's got one, Jimmy.  Yes, he does.  He's got one.  He stood up straight.  No, he doesn't.  All right, stop.  Wiener.  Come on.  You're in the business of talk.  You're on the radio.  Just turned his back to the crowd, too.  Yeah.  His name means penis.  Yeah.  You do a pun or some sort of a dick tie-in.  Come on.  All right. 
[01:57:30]  What, is it set up?  Yeah.  Get it set up again.  Come on, virus.  I'll help you out.  Get it set up now.  Did you hear?  There's more Anthony Wiener pictures available online.  Punchline now!  I heard.  Last time I saw a dick like that.  You know.  Yeah.  Something like that, maybe.  Exactly.  I was leaning against the wall, humiliated.  Or something. 
[01:58:00]  Wiener also means hot dog.  That's right.  Yeah.  Hot dog or penis.  Come on.  Wiener dog.  Last time I saw a wiener like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, he's got one.  He's got one.  There you go.  He's almost there.  Finally.  He's working it out.  He's working it out.  We can go to break.  Here it is.  Come on.  Finally.  Here you go.  He's got it.  Look at him.  Look at him.  The joke you've been waiting for.  Here it is.  Now he's mouthing something. 
[01:58:30]  He's mouthing something.  He's working it out in his head.  Mouthing something.  Mouthing something.  Yes.  Probably a sandwich.  Too bad it's not a hollow point.  He's putting it together.  Oscar Mayer.  That's right.  Yeah.  Think of that.  He's mouthing the words.  Let's go.  Let's go.  We heard and we're waiting for more.  Stop looking up into the vents.  By the way.  A gift of humor is not going to fall out of those vents.  I mean, Virus, let us know when you're ready. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  By the way.  By the way.  Anthony's a seer.  Yeah.  You said just last week.  Yeah.  That this place, Sirius XM, will kill somebody.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Don't even.  The stress.  You said the stress in this place will kill.  I don't know the exact quote.  Will kill somebody.  I did.  You're right.  When Roland was having his breakdown.  Wow.  Just wanted to put that out there.  It's a little creepy that you said that last week.  That's Twilight Zone-ish.  And we lost a really good kid from Liquid Metal overnight. 
[01:59:30]  I'm sure it was stress.  And now back to the virus.  That's right.  The virus, ladies and gentlemen.  You had Mouya Mouthing there.  Just do it.  We have some faith in that great joke.  Well, we're going to need the set-up.  Yeah, we're going to need the set-up.  We're going to need the set-up.  Just go with it.  Because it looked like you had it there.  You were mouthing those words.  Here we go.  Here it is.  The virus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Confidence.  Eyes on the audience.  He's almost there.  How do you get Anthony Weiner to stop grabbing his cock?  You throw a penny at him.  Get it?  It's a Jewish joke, too. 
[02:00:00]  You can make it a Jewish joke or whatever.  You can go Jewy-Jew.  Yeah.  You can go penis.  What are we doing on our night of stand-up for the staff?  Do you know how great this would be?  A night of stand-up for the staff.  Oh, God.  Would that be fantastic.  Let E-Rock go first, and none of us, no one else has to go.  No one has to go.  There'd be red light in him.  Not a word has been said.  Virus can host.  Oh, MC Virus.  You had it.  You had it.  Do the set-up.  Let's go.  Yeah, come on.  What were you thinking?  You were definitely, you had something. 
[02:00:30]  You did.  Come on, now.  Just say it.  Jordan and Scranton.  Shucky-ducky.  Snack-snack.  Shucky-ducky.  Crack-crack.  Crack-crack.  Crack-crack.  Come on, Virus.  He's got a big nose.  Don't forget that.  See, Coke logic.  The cock photos just keep coming.  Ah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Cock coming.  Wiener.  Yeah.  He's probably tying in a smart joke about the congressional gym.  Right.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Let's go, Virus.  What were you mouthing?  You had it.  Doesn't make any sense. 
[02:01:00]  So just say it.  If it doesn't make sense, sometimes it's absurd.  Maybe those are the best ones.  He's probably going for George Carlin when all we need is Henny Youngman.  Exactly.  Don't worry about it.  There's some Henny Youngman.  Let's go.  Set-up action.  Set-up.  Did you see that there's more Anthony Wiener video?  No.  No.  Did you see that there's more Anthony Wiener pics available online?  Yes.  There we go, Virus.  Now.  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  It's so close.  It's there.  It's there.  Just spit it out violently.  I wish you could see what we're looking at.  Come on.  He's so close.  He put his mouth on the mic.  He started talking.  He's actually squeezing a fist right now.  He's got it.  Get that.  Get this set-up.  You've got to get this set-up.  Here it is.  It's sitting in that rotten mouthy air.  Chokey, Chokey.  Fat, fat.  Thank you, Seth.  Illinois.  He's right on the tip of your tongue next to that pork chop.  Take out a little dinner.  Come on, man. 
[02:02:00]  We're 12 minutes into this.  God, Jesus.  We're 12 minutes in, I think.  Quick joke.  All right, he's got it.  He's got it.  He just cleared his throat.  There it is.  That's usually a sign.  Did you hear that there's more Anthony Wiener picks available online?  Yes, we did.  Oh, yeah.  With those photos, he officially qualifies for the Nathan Hot Dog Contest.  What?  It doesn't make sense.  That makes no sense.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[02:02:30]  That's terrible.  They eat hot dogs.  Yeah.  That's not even...  That's stunk.  Why would he qualify for the Nathans?  Oh, God.  We have high expectations today.  He comes up with that shit.  He had 12, 13 minutes to work on that.  Why would he qualify for the...  Yeah, why would that qualify for the...  He stinks.  He's so bad.  That was horrible.  He didn't even go for penis.  He went for a hot dog.  Oh, of course he did.  What does that mean?  He's eating his own cock?  Like, I don't get it.  Oh, wow.  What the fuck? 
[02:03:00]  Why would he eat his own dick?  What the fuck do we even do that?  He's the wiener.  There's a fucking shit like that.  Wouldn't he get eaten in the contest?  Yeah.  Even if the joke was bad, but that was almost offensively non-joke.  Yeah.  I'm angry now.  Yeah, man.  He qualifies.  We bring him in to bring happiness to everybody.  Oh, yeah.  The virus.  What the fuck?  Okay.  My dick.  My dick.  My tiny little dick.  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick. 
[02:03:30]  It goes up with no problem.  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick.  My dick.  My dick.  My tiny little dick.  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick.  It goes up with no problem.  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick.  All right.  I'll just go for the part.  My dick.  My dick.  My tiny little dick.  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick. 
[02:04:00]  It goes up with no problem.  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick.  All right.  That's a frog.  That's really good, Bobo.  Yeah.  My dick.  Yeah, I know.  That's a frog.  I guess I'm just trying to...  Mysterious XM.  The virus.  On an all-new Butt Files, homosexual sci-fi investigative couple, Muldouche and Sally argue the authenticity  of a mysterious pornographic takeover. 
[02:04:30]  Why are you being so confrontational?  Because I didn't tell you to watch shit.  You implied it.  Saying, well, hey, you didn't watch this yet.  When you watch this, you're going to be blown away.  But when did I tell you to watch it?  I said, I found it interesting.  Dude, why are you being like this now?  We're just talking about this.  Wow, Mr. Passion over here.  But the couple soon finds their homoerotic partnership spiraling out of control.  Don't touch me.  I don't want you to touch me.  Oh, my God.  I don't want you to touch me.  I don't want you...  Who the fuck are you going to be touching me?  I'm trying to talk to you.  Really?  You don't have to touch me.  You can talk to me and not touch me.  Find out if the two lovers will find the transgendered individuals responsible for their dilemma. 
[02:05:00]  You're like, oh, I'm telling you to watch this.  I didn't tell you to watch it.  You're making shit up.  Why are you so hung up on this for?  Why are you so mad at me today?  Because every time I come in here and I say something that you don't like, this is what  you do.  Here, ready?  All on the next Butt Files.  Virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:05:30]  Hey, what happened on Fox Business?  Little Ebonics thing?  Dude, dude, dude.  Yeah, he's being called a horrible racist, the guy.  Is he really?  Yeah.  Anchor Eric Bolling.  Bolling.  How do you say his name?  B-O-L-L.  How do you say that?  Bolling.  I'm going to get to the ball.  I don't know.  Before you pop this in, I've got to know before I forget.  Do we have the video...  I mean, you can pop it in, but don't play it, because I'll forget in a second.  Do we have the audio of the daughter of the woman that got the face transplant from 
[02:06:00]  monkey ripping off her face?  I don't know about it.  I don't think so.  Oh, I...  We've got to get that?  I have not heard about it or heard it.  Someone tweeted it to me yesterday.  It is fucking brutal.  This reporter is a dummy.  All right, we've got to get that.  A glistening dummy.  Can we get that?  Is it a long...  It was tweeted to me yesterday.  Is it a long one?  No.  It's quick.  All right, let's find that.  Oh, was it...  The Twitter name, give him credit, was it Ape Face?  I don't think it was Ape Face. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, I think it was Chewed Testicles.  That's one of the...  Yeah.  I hate this Continental United merger.  I said chimp, didn't I?  Or I said monkey.  I know it's not a monkey.  No, it's the same thing.  No, a chimp...  They jump up and down, they bite you.  ...is one of the great apes.  Monkeys are just monkeys.  A chimp is one of the great apes, one of the great primates, along with an orangutan  and the gorilla and the chimpanzee, which is very different from, let's say, a macaque.  What gorilla-type animal do you hate the worst? 
[02:07:00]  Gorilla-type animal?  I just don't like those fucking orangutans.  Orangutans are the worst?  They're really like, ugh, they just look stupid.  I think they are the retards of the great apes.  A chimp's a baby or, like, young chimp in the old-fashioned engineer uniform, where they'd  wear the suspenders and the little train engineer hat.  Nothing cuter in the world.  All right, so go from your favorite to your worst, then. 
[02:07:30]  I gotta go with the chimpanzee in the engineer suit.  Gotcha.  That's good.  Okay.  Then I guess I gotta go with the gorilla.  The gorilla, especially the little baby gorilla's eyes are really cute when they look around.  They don't know what they're doing and stuff.  And then the stupid orangutan.  Is the worst.  Yeah.  Isn't there something in between you're missing?  No, I think that's pretty much it for, like, the basic great apes.  What about those weird, skinny monkey-type fucking animals?  Those are monkeys, though. 
[02:08:00]  They're not like apes.  I guess, okay.  Like one of those long-armed fucking dumb monkeys.  What about the monkey-type thing that has the big, huge red S?  That's a baboon.  Yeah, you didn't put baboon in there.  I don't think baboon is part of the great apes.  Oh, baboon.  Technicality.  Come on.  I don't know.  I know, uh, uh, yeah, well, a gibbon.  You're talking about a gibbon?  One of those big fucking long-armed gibbon?  I hate a gibbon.  Yeah, I like a taken.  Yeah.  A gibbs-man-dat-bin. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  So what happened to this Fox Business guy?  Eric Bowling.  Bowling.  What did he say?  Accused of racism for use of Ebonics during Obama's story.  Yes, who's coming to dinner?  A dictator.  Mr. Obama shares a laugh with one of Africa's kleptocrats.  It's not the first time he's had a hoodlum in his house.  What?  What is he doing there?  Some Ebonics.  Is that what he's doing?  I don't think he's a racist.  I think he's just a corny fucking white guy trying to be funny. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, cornball.  You're not being edgy or funny.  Just trying to be one of those guys.  He's a cornball.  Smile for the birdie.  Our president sitting with one of Africa's most wanted.  It's not the first time he's had a hood in the big crib.  Oh, come on.  What's wrong with this?  Is this a real issue?  It shouldn't be.  Because he's just...  Is this guy in trouble for just being wacky?  This is just wacky.  He should be in trouble for being awful.  So once with all the hoods in the hizzy, a month after the White House hosted the rapper Common, 
[02:09:30]  who glorifies violence on cops, the president opened his doors to one of Africa's most evil dictators.  This shouldn't be a problem.  The rapper thing I get, because they did have a rapper who had talked...  Yeah, I mean...  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I'm trying to find that one, too.  I'm sure Media Matters is all over.  It's like...  Cocksuckers.  Shit.  You trying to see if this guy's in trouble?  We have it.  Wait.  I wonder if I got... 
[02:10:00]  Where's this audio?  Wait, wait, wait.  I might have it.  I might have it.  I might have it in my...  You might have what?  The chimp thing?  Yeah, I might.  All right.  We'll find that.  Are we done with this guy from the Fox Business?  Yeah, he just sounds like he's being zany or something.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  Yeah, we could cut our losses there.  You heard about the St. Louis woman?  What happened in St. Lou?  Huh?  Huh?  St. Louis...  All right.  I'll just...  St. Louis woman awarded $95 million after former boss allegedly masturbated on her. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, no.  $95 million?  I would fucking let my boss do it for a million...  What the fuck?  If I was going to get a million dollars, fucking just spew on me.  It could not be worth that much.  I'd let Blatter fuck me in the butt for $2,500.  A St. Louis woman who said...  What are you getting now?  Exactly.  I'd let the lawyers here fuck me in the ass for exactly what my salary is the last three years.  We're already getting fucked in the ass. 
[02:11:00]  A St. Louis woman...  This could be one of the funniest lines ever written.  Ready for this?  Yeah.  Are you ready?  I'm ready.  A St. Louis woman who said she was hit on the head with her boss's genitals...  Hit on the head?  How does that happen?  ...was awarded what her attorneys believe is the largest payout ever in an American sexual harassment lawsuit.  What kind of job is it?  Ashley Alford was awarded $95 million in compensation from the Aarons, Inc., a large rent-to-own furniture chain after she said the store failed to act after a manager allegedly assaulted her twice in one day. 
[02:11:30]  She told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the award was likely to be capped because of federal law and will be closer to $40 million.  Damn, that's a good payday.  Fuck you.  It's in Atlanta?  That's crazy money.  You would deal with that for $40 million?  Wait, it's Atlanta?  Yes.  Crazy money.  So here's what it is.  The jury...  I'm going to guess...  I can guess the makeup of the jury. 
[02:12:00]  Give me a jury.  Really?  Alford claimed that the store's then-manager, Richard Moore, gave her inappropriate nicknames and touched her inappropriately when she first began working there in 2005.  Nearly a year after she was hired, she claimed he came up to her in the stockroom and whacked her on the head with his penis.  How do you do that?  Was she sitting down?  She had to be.  That's fucked up. 
[02:12:30]  That's funny?  That is funny.  All right, good.  Funny.  Sorry, but that's just funny.  That's amazing.  Then later that day, he lifted her shirt and masturbated over her as he held her down.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, that's a little rough.  Now I'm out.  You're out?  You can't hold the woman down.  No, no.  You've got to give her a chance to leave the situation.  Hold on a minute.  Now you're trying to jerk off on her.  What, are you going to just let her scramble away so you look silly?  If she wants to stay there and be jerked off on.  Do people really work at places where a boss might take his fucking penis out and hit you on the head? 
[02:13:00]  And just start fucking hitting you on the head?  With his schlong?  What the fuck?  Believe me, that's literally no more shocking than what goes on here.  Same shit.  Would they really allow the line?  The online?  I just stopped.  I just stopped.  Turn it off.  Is this the chimp thing?  I'm looking for, I don't think it was that.  You think that St. Louis woman's line?  The chimp thing.  God damn it. 
[02:13:30]  Exaggerating, definitely.  You think exaggerating?  Yeah, definitely exaggerating.  What do you think really happened?  He probably pulled his dick out.  Wow.  Maybe waved it in her face.  But do you think he thought he could do that because she might have been accepting?  Or did he completely just lose it and the perv switch went off?  Why wouldn't he just lie?  Yeah, the perv switch went off.  Really?  I didn't jerk off on you, madam.  Madam.  News 4 interview with chimp victim.  Nice.  Got it.  You got it? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Now what do we do with it?  I don't know.  I pass it on.  How do you get it to, how do I get it over there?  I'll turn it off.  I could tweet you.  All right, hold on.  Let me try to.  Oh my God.  Thank you, Kevin from Connecticut.  Why does the name always match the story?  Oh, like Wiener?  Like Wiener with his Wiener pictures?  Yeah.  The boss's name was Richard Moore.  Dick Moore.  Dick Moore.  Dick Moore.  Why does that always work out in news stories?  I don't know. 
[02:14:30]  Why did that pass us by?  But it does.  His fucking first name is Dick.  My Dick.  And Dick Moore.  Oh my God.  These computers, by the way, suck an asshole.  Nice language.  A giant asshole.  Well, why didn't you say anything about that before now?  That's weird that.  Because it just hit me again.  Again.  Thank you for saying again.  We've been talking about how bad these computers are for a long, long time.  Well, I'm going to share to Twitter.  I'm sure they're making progress on that.  Like they're making progress on getting us interns.  I'm just going to. 
[02:15:00]  Here it goes.  Good news for everybody.  Which I just shared to Twitter.  Did you get it?  Do you see it?  Now look for me.  Look for me.  And then I got it.  I'm on.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That should be it.  Nope.  I think.  Nope.  There it is.  You obviously blocked me because I can't see you.  What?  Why would you block me?  What did I do to you?  You know.  Why would you block Hope?  I don't see.  I didn't see your tweet.  That's not very nice.  First of all. 
[02:15:30]  Did you block me?  I'm a LeBron James fan.  And I don't need to read shit like that.  Look, I'm just going back to my shitty life today.  Go back to your shitty life.  Stupid LeBron James.  Really knows how to win some of the fans back.  Yeah.  Did you get it?  Yeah.  I got both.  Both?  Wait a minute.  Did you block me?  No.  Why am I not getting a tweet?  No, I follow.  Why'd you block Hope?  You blocked me.  Why'd you block McGurio?  Did you go to.  Son of a bitch.  Where did you go to?  You just went to like Anthony.  You went to my thing. 
[02:16:00]  Well, you tweeted it, right?  Yeah.  Did you retweet it?  No, no, no.  No, I just tweeted it.  Did you DM it?  No, I just.  With a dick pic?  I just shared it from Twitter.  From Facebook.  From YouTube.  Oh, my gosh.  Wow.  What happened?  I just shared it from YouTube.  I found it on YouTube.  I put share and tweeted it.  Oh.  And a lady popped up with Chris Penn.  So if you go to my name.  Oh, here it is.  If you go to my name.  Oh, you unblocked me to save face, I see.  That's true.  About time.  Now it's here. 
[02:16:30]  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I did really quickly.  Uh-huh.  I had to.  Oh, we got to watch this.  This looks good.  Okay, put it up.  Put the volume up.  Listen to what she says.  Do it on the computer.  No, don't do it.  You got to see it all on the air.  I'm watching it right now.  No, do it on the air.  What?  That way it's fucked up.  Why don't you just put it on the thing, Sam?  Do it on the air.  Yeah, just put it on YouTube.  It's right there.  Do it.  Just do it.  Play that one.  She's not bad looking.  Oh, she wasn't eaten by a gorilla.  Now put the volume up.  Oh, wow.  Look at her.  No, stop it.  Until the volume's up.  What?  I don't have the option to do that.  You got to put the volume up.  You put the volume up.  No, no, no. 
[02:17:00]  What happened?  It's good.  She's fucked up.  You'll just see how retarded this reporter is.  All right, what's the setup on this?  All right, this is the woman.  She's the daughter of the woman that got her face ripped off.  Remember that?  Right.  By the chimpanzee.  Charlotte Nash.  It ate her fucking face.  She's still alive?  Yeah.  She got a face transplant.  Didn't somebody die in that incident?  Yeah, the woman that owned the monkey.  Right, okay.  The chimp, whatever the fuck you want to call it.  And the chimp died, too.  But the woman that's still alive with basically no face or a reconstructive face.  This is her daughter.  That's her daughter commenting on how the face transplant went to this reporter who obviously 
[02:17:30]  is not listening to a goddamn thing.  Gotcha.  All right.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Put the TV.  Just play.  How do I do that?  No, do it there.  I want it over there.  How she's feeling.  Has she been able to see her new face?  It's still a little difficult to understand her, but she says things like she loves me  and things like that.  And no, she will not be able to see her new face. 
[02:18:00]  Can you imagine that moment, though, when that mirror is held up?  What do you think her reaction will be?  Well, she can't see.  Yeah.  Well, and I know that you're Uncle Steve, your mom's boyfriend.  She's blind.  She had her eyeballs ripped out, you dumb fucking reporter.  Like, the reporter didn't do enough research to realize the woman's blind.  She goes, no, she won't see her face.  Why would she say, what do you think her reaction would be?  Because this is what her reaction would be.  Oh, my God.  Can you rewind that a little bit?  This is why that reporter is fucking shooting fire. 
[02:18:30]  That's Amy Roebuck.  The reporter should be used to be really hot.  But why not just admit the, oh, I'm sorry I didn't know that.  You know what?  I'm sorry I forgot that.  She just, ah.  They're fucking robots.  Ah.  Does she acknowledge that she just asked what a blind woman's going to see?  No.  No.  But it's a harsh question to be asking the daughter to begin with because the woman can't be pleased with her new face no matter what.  But she's, like, saying, like, the daughter even, like, hinted, like, no, she won't be seeing her new face. 
[02:19:00]  Is she seeing how she's feeling?  Has she been able to see her new face?  It's still a little difficult to understand her, but she says things like she loves me and things like that.  And, um, no, she will not be able to see her new face.  Can you imagine that moment, though, when that mirror is held up?  What do you think her reaction will be?  Well, she can't say.  Yeah.  Well, and I know that your Uncle Steve, your mom's brother, said.  Wow.  Yeah.  In that moment is everything that is wrong with the fucking media in this country. 
[02:19:30]  Yes.  You fucking soulless dummies.  Wow.  How about you listen?  Did you say she doesn't listen?  She didn't do research on the story.  Oh, face transplant?  Let me see.  Oh, wow.  She lost both her eyeballs.  So they're going to have to put in, you know, prosthetic eyes.  And she gets this face transplant, but she's blind.  She didn't even see that part of the story.  But even if you didn't know that, and you made the mistake, it happens.  How about you go, oh, God, I didn't.  Oh, God, I'm sorry.  You're fucking. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, right back to pleasantness.  Yeah.  Pleasantness.  Get the pleasantness.  So your uncle.  Uncle Steve, he's got eyes.  Pleasantness.  That is everything that's wrong with those shitheads.  Absolutely.  How important are the eyeballs?  That's coming in on instant feedback.  When you're asking a question about seeing.  How important is it to not have your cornea scraped out by dirty monkey fingers?  How damaging is that to the retina?  When dirt-scraping monkey figures dig into your eyes angrily for 12 minutes. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, you know how bad that is?  He's just been picking his monkey hemorrhoids right up his ass, and then he just puts a gaping wound in you.  Believe me, that monkey was not Purelling right before he began doing eye surgery.  No.  On old Charlotte Nash.  Your uncle Steve, not one word.  Nope.  About the insensitive questions you just asked.  Unbelievable.  How about an apology?  How about you go, you want Tracy Morgan to apologize?  How about that woman who is absolutely not doing her fucking job properly? 
[02:21:00]  Right.  Oh, God, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize.  Oh, sorry.  How about a human moment?  Yeah, what would be wrong with that?  I would be no problem.  We all fuck up.  Right.  And the daughter's there going, she can't see.  Yeah, she's blind.  Oh, she's blind.  So imagine when the mirror's held up.  Yeah, mirror, you mean the thing you look into with eyeballs, you dummy?  Exactly.  Like I said, she fucking couldn't do.  What's her name again?  Amy Roebuck, did I get it right?  What channel is that?  That's NBC.  That was the Today Show, right?  God, they're all so fucking robotic. 
[02:21:30]  That's why none of them really add anything.  Yeah.  None of them add anything.  Literally, the news could just scroll and we could read it ourselves.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And we do it online anyway.  God, what a dope.  We don't need those dummies.  We don't need those shit online.  We don't need those dummies anymore.  Just keep it pleasant.  Keep it pleasant.  Don't acknowledge your mistake.  Yeah.  Hey, wow.  Thank you, Ant.  That's fucking...  Oh, I love that one.  That's a great one.  That's a fun one.  Not as good as the woman getting hit in the head with her boss's dick. 
[02:22:00]  Well, I wish I had some video of that, or audio at least, hit with a dick.  And she made some cash off of that one, huh?  95, possibly only 40 in the end, I guess.  I have a prediction for the fucking Casey Anthony trial right there.  Right.  She will not be convicted of first-degree murder.  Whoa.  Is it with the jury already?  No, I guess the prosecution has another witness, and then they're going to wrap up, and then  the defense takes over, and maybe another week or two left of the trial. 
[02:22:30]  But this is a capital murder case, and they just don't have it.  They don't have enough evidence.  Too much doubt?  Yeah, maybe not.  Too much.  They don't have enough evidence.  As far as that charge goes.  Look, people...  Right.  People know she's involved in some type of shenanigans with this kid being dead.  I know.  But as far as getting a first-degree murder charge on that, nah.  I ain't seeing it.  No fucking way.  So she gets the lesser charge, and then how many years in jail? 
[02:23:00]  I don't know.  She's got some other charges against her, but she's not got that major one.  That was the biggie.  And if they can get a mistrial out of this, they're going to have to give her some kind  of manslaughter, maybe, or involuntary, or negligent homicide, something like that.  Because they don't know if she did drown in the pool, and then all she did as a guilty  person was throw the kid in the woods instead of report it.  Or did she kill this girl flat-out, first-degree murder, because she wanted to go out and party? 
[02:23:30]  Or did she drug her to try to go out, and the kid wound up dying?  Like, there's a few different...  There's too many different ways this kid could have died, and they don't have any proof.  Well, how about this?  Since this bitch isn't saying anything, and she knows what happened, how about...  Here's what the deal is.  If you want to save your own life, you get up there and you tell us what happened.  Otherwise, we're going to assume you killed the kid.  Enough already.  So you want to throw away the Fifth? 
[02:24:00]  No, no.  Do I understand?  Just throw away the Fifth Amendment on self-incrimination.  No, I understand self-incrimination.  But it is enraging.  It's like, don't cry if you get convicted, then.  If you sit there and you don't fucking sit up and speak for yourself, you deserve to be  convicted.  You're a dope.  And I can't think of how I would never...  I wouldn't defend myself in court.  If you were innocent, right?  Yeah, if I was innocent, I would scream it.  But sometimes you'll look even worse, I think.  I don't know.  I think that myself, too.  It's like, if you're innocent, you'll get your ass on that stand and plead to that fucking 
[02:24:30]  jury that you're innocent.  But a lot of these lawyers are like, no, the worst thing you can do is get up on that  stand.  You gotta, you know, let us do it.  It's all the facts.  Because that's based on pure emotion.  Did O.J. not testify?  O.J. didn't testify, no.  That's pure emotion that you're trying to evoke when you testify.  The jury is just going to see that.  They're really going to have a hard time listening to your facts.  The lawyer can spill facts and experts and whatnot.  But when you get up there and talk, that is the jury looking at you going, oh, so here's 
[02:25:00]  the murderer.  Let's see what she's got to say to get herself off the hook.  So sometimes they have them not testify.  Okay.  I don't know.  I don't think they'll ever testify.  I really do think the prosecution has had trouble proving this case.  And I've watched the whole fucking thing.  I'm no expert, but neither is the jury.  So sitting there watching it, I just don't see that they've proven beyond reasonable doubt  that she intentionally murdered a child. 
[02:25:30]  I think the pool thing that the defense has brought up is not a bad way to confuse the  jury.  All the defense has to do is throw enough options out.  They don't have to prove the kid died in a pool.  They don't have to prove that the kid accidentally overdosed.  They don't have to prove that the mother fucking killed the kid.  All they have to do is throw enough options out there where the prosecution can't prove  any of these didn't happen or did happen.  It's a shell game. 
[02:26:00]  The mother's a pig.  She's a fucking pig.  She's a fucking tits on her.  I'm not saying I wouldn't titty fuck her as punishment.  Oh, she should just be over the house.  Doesn't she go against her whole baby thing, then?  She had a kid.  She hates kids, apparently.  But didn't that ruin her body?  You say that.  No, you know what?  But, um, I don't know.  She looked like she kind of snapped back in a little slop in her.  I'm not talking fucking marrying the broad.  I'm just talking about, you know, maybe a little hot tub action.  Like Bobby.  Bobby Kelly. 
[02:26:30]  Shouldn't she be fucking...  She knows what happened to that kid, and she's not saying.  She is...  I hope that even if it would get overturned on appeal, I hope she gets convicted of first  degree murder.  All of her money is going to legal fees anyway.  She said.  She said what happened.  She's a compulsive liar.  Yeah, she's sickening.  She's made up this nanny that never existed.  She's lied about looking for the child.  She didn't report the child missing for 31 days.  She really should.  If we had a really good system of justice, we all know what's going on. 
[02:27:00]  The bailiff should be able just to put a gun at her temple and just fire it.  And just pull the trigger.  Just fire it.  But everything that she's been doing, guilty, everything she's been doing and saying could  also point to the kid accidentally died.  She wanted to just cover it up by ditching the kid in the woods.  So why isn't she saying that?  Why does she know that she's fighting for her life and she's not saying this is what happened? 
[02:27:30]  I think as far as what's going on in that trial right now, the best thing she could do  is shut the fuck up.  They don't have any time of death.  Really?  It's not exact because all they found was bones months later.  Is there nothing in the bones they could get DNA-wise?  Nothing in the marrow?  They got DNA that prove it's the child.  But I mean, there's nothing from, I guess, a drug or anything?  No, there was no broken bones.  There was no...  The only thing they come up with are things like, well, the mandible was still held on 
[02:28:00]  the skull and that proves that the duct tape was put there before the child died.  And it just sounds very vague.  Like, the prosecution doesn't have a, here's when the baby died and here's where she was.  She doesn't need an alibi because they can't really determine the time close enough where  she would need an alibi.  Do you think the kid was crying and she fucking tied the kid to the bed and duct tape her mouth  because she was doing something, she was having a date over her? 
[02:28:30]  Or in the trunk of her car.  That's what they're thinking.  She put her in the trunk of her car with duct tape over her mouth after she used, like,  Xanax on her or something, a drugger, and the kid might have vomited or just suffocated  or the heat from in the trunk or what have you.  And then she ditched it.  Or she was getting laid at her house and had the kid taped upstairs in the room.  Yeah, yeah.  Could have been that, too.  Because they're saying that the nanny, Xanny, is Xanax. 
[02:29:00]  She would give the kid Xanax to put her to sleep while she had her hijinks.  Her duck lips.  She's fucking, this woman is killable.  Wow.  That's what Florida's hoping for.  It's not going to happen.  The prosecution's hoping.  But I don't see it.  You heard it here first.  Answer is no way.  You're probably right here.  I'm not seeing a first degree murder charge.  I don't think the prosecution has enough on her.  Maybe there's just no way to prove it.  Yeah.  Another week or so, you said?  Two weeks maybe?  Another maybe week or two for the defense closing and then deliberations.  Relatively fast trial, right? 
[02:29:30]  No, you know what?  The OJ thing took forever.  Yeah, OJ took forever.  But this one could take a while.  And then deliberations, I don't know.  Especially if they have a split jury.  I don't see that going that quickly.  They've sequestered these poor motherfuckers, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they're just like, they can't talk about anything.  Are they in a hotel or something?  Or do they get to go home?  I don't know.  Maybe they get to go home, but they can't talk to anyone.  They can't read anything. 
[02:30:00]  They've really...  That's a major inconvenience.  Oh, my God, right?  Is that her getting a fucking finger up the ass?  That's right.  She's got her little tramp dot tattoo.  She's just a whore.  Well, she has her jeans on.  How is she getting the finger up the ass?  I don't know.  Her friend is like digging in through her pants.  Fucking around.  Yeah.  What a fucking hewa.  All right, well...  Then you see her laughing sometimes in court.  She'll fucking be talking to her attorney, and she's got her mouth blocked, but she's 
[02:30:30]  like, ha-ha, she kind of laughs.  Why would she do that?  And then sometimes she's like, ha-ha, she's crying.  But why would she laugh?  Because she's a psychopath.  Yeah, but why doesn't the attorney go, look, I'm trying to help you here.  Stop with the laughing shit.  I think the attorney...  Look at her.  She's like smiling.  Hey, my kid's dead.  Your aunt might have just said it.  She's a psycho.  She's a psychopath.  Of course she is.  I hate mentally ill people, as you know.  Right.  But maybe that she is literally just crazy, and we're looking at her like normal people  standards.  She's truly nuts, maybe.  I think she's truly nuts.  She's a delusional, a compulsive liar, a sociopath, and a psycho. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, and Glenn Close, it's funny, I didn't want to argue with her, but just talking about  that, and I know that there's something to be done for mentally ill people, but I just  hate the fact that if she...  Let's just say she's mentally ill.  Let's say she is.  Yeah.  You're going to tell me she's still not a pig who knows what she's doing.  Of course she does.  Yeah.  Or she'd be admitting it.  Going, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug,  glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug, glug 
[02:31:30]  I think she's crazy, which is absolutely why if I lived down there or knew her, I would  probably be dating her, because they're all fucking crazy. 
[02:32:00]  I also, dude, attract a line of kooks.  Lunatics, right?  A fucking line of wackos.  Mental patients.  We've all had our share, huh?  Oh, share.  A share would mean part.  Share would mean part.  I've always had my total.  It's a complete fucking, the glass is full, full of lunatics.  Always crazy?  Yes!  Had my share.  Crazy people.  I would put myself in the category of had my share, not always. 
[02:32:30]  I think I've always had crazy people.  Always crazy.  And if you're with a girl now that you deem not crazy, it's because you just haven't figured  out her craziness yet.  See, that's where I am.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My current girlfriend is probably completely insane.  I just haven't quite pinned it down yet.  You haven't figured out the combination yet?  I haven't quite, yeah, hit the right combination, but it's like finding the trap in a fucking  drug dealer's car.  You gotta hit this, turn the defroster, pound the top.  One day you can just do something so innocent and realize, holy shit, this is the thing. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  You want a cookie, sweetie?  Cookies!  Cookies!  My father!  Well, all right!  Another lunatic.  Here comes the fucking...  And then a hatch door opens in the ceiling and fucking steamer trunks of baggage come  out.  I'm just covered in baggage.  Yeah.  Why did I have to suffer every Father's Day?  Because you had a shitty father experience.  Oh, you had that one.  I had Christmas.  You had Christmas?  Yeah, yeah, my ex-wife's father left on Christmas Day. 
[02:33:30]  I was talking about one of my exes.  It was Father's Day, and then a day that was, I guess, his birthday.  Fuck you with the fucking days.  All of a sudden, it would be just a horrible day.  And you would think I would write it on the calendar for the next year.  Yeah.  But then I would forget.  And then it would be some beautiful day, and all of a sudden, all hell would be breaking  loose.  It's because it's Father's birthday.  How about every Christmas is ruined for nine fuck years? 
[02:34:00]  Right.  What'd you do?  Every Christmas.  What's the matter?  This was the day that my father left our family and started a whole new family and abandoned  us.  Merry fucking Christmas!  I'm trying to find my family's here.  Fuck you.  And I know this is way in the past for you, but I'm sure you gave her probably nine nice  Christmases, or at least tried.  I tried.  That ninth one might have been hard with the girlfriend around. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, no, she really hates Christmases.  You gave her eight good ones.  Yeah.  And one humiliation.  But you know what I mean?  Why can't we as human beings go, okay, we had shitty Christmases in the past, but the  current person I'm with has given me wonderful Christmases.  Yeah.  So why can't you now push maybe some of those bad Christmases further away?  No.  They will always take precedent.  Why do we do that?  Because they're crazy!  But why do we do that as human beings?  I don't know.  Why?  I don't fucking know. 
[02:35:00]  Why do we do that?  I had a weird thing with Christmas for many years because my mom was the weird Christmas  one.  Really?  Yeah, because when she was growing up, obviously something bad happened around Christmas.  Oh, shit.  And every year she would kind of have a little bit of a mental breakdown about Christmas.  So then it was passed on in my generation.  So I, for a while, felt really weird about Christmas.  I always loved Christmas.  I'm up to about seven really good ones now.  Say that.  And I was able to kind of push some of those weird Christmas memories away. 
[02:35:30]  I'm not saying I'm better than anyone.  I'm not saying that.  But as human beings, why do we do that?  Always focus on the Christmases that were bad instead of adding it up and going, well,  I've had enough good Christmases now.  I don't know.  Because they take all the good shit for granted.  Is that what it is?  And it's just a bad, bad shit.  Why do you think that is, Jimmy?  She's got a juicy ass on her.  Let me turn that to me, Sam.  Yeah, right?  Look at its meaty.  Wow.  That's a fucking juicy rump.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a baby-killing ass right there.  Yeah, I forgive her.  I forgive her. 
[02:36:00]  All that I said, forget it.  Yeah.  She's got two guys' pants pulled down.  She's like squeezing their ass.  She is a hue-a.  Would you get really nervous when Christmas was coming around?  I would.  Yes.  It was like an anxiety thing.  You seem like the type of guy that would really enjoy a Christmas.  I love Christmas.  Because I know what you do with your house and stuff.  You go all in.  I decorate it up like a winter wonderland.  So go way back, though.  Yeah.  Christmas is right around.  Probably right after Thanksgiving, Macy's Day's Parade.  That's when it starts. 
[02:36:30]  The parade ends with Santa Claus, so now it's Christmas season.  Do you start slowly but surely feeling it?  It's like, oh, boy, that turkey was good.  And once again, finishing the parade this year, Santa Claus.  Here comes Santa Claus.  Ringing in the Christmas season.  He left me.  Shut up.  You're an adult now.  Daddy, daddy, daddy.  Any fucking grown woman with daddy issues, just stop it already.  Get the fuck over it. 
[02:37:00]  They're not infallible people.  When should Christ almighty, unless he was tooling it in the ass, get over it.  That I'll give you.  If daddy's tooling it in the ass, you could fucking be 89 on your deathbed and go, my  father fucked me over, literally.  And that's fine.  But if daddy maybe was working too much, daddy didn't get you, he didn't make it to your fucking  play, or daddy fucking was on a business trip during your fucking prom, shut up, you dummies. 
[02:37:30]  Or even start a new family.  Yeah, whatever.  He was bored.  At what age do you let that go?  Yeah, let it go.  I'm sure if you're like an early teenager and all that, I get it.  It's got to be painful.  But at a certain age, you got to just let that shit go.  You have to.  Let fly.  25?  Is that a fair age?  Please.  I think when you hit college, you're too busy doing all sorts of other cool shit that you  can let some of that stuff go.  I'll take it one step further. 
[02:38:00]  Even if he was diddling your pussy!  Hey.  A pussy diddle?  Maybe, maybe he was stressed out, and mother was tired, and then he just thought, hey,  I'm going to go upstairs and diddle her pussy!  Do you think, do you think the ex is enjoying Christmases to this day?  I don't know, but I can only hope, personally, no.  My, uh, Father's Day is what, this weekend? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Oh boy.  Yeah.  Good luck.  I feel sorry for somebody.  Oh, I feel like someone's in a world of shit.  If, if, who knows?  If she even has somebody.  Who knows?  I don't even fucking know what she's up to, but.  I don't either.  If she does have someone new, boy, I want to call that guy and kind of give him the  heads up what to expect on Father's Day.  I believe anyone would have known already.  Hey, I want to squeeze in this warrior shit that's just been sitting in front of me.  How about I squeeze my dick? 
[02:39:00]  My.  Oh, wiener joke.  Hey, warrior.  We got Esther Koo coming in in a few minutes, but, uh, I want to squeeze in the warrior.  He, warrior.  He puts out a YouTube video exposing Hulk Hogan.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He decided, I guess Hulk Hogan, after Macho Man died, said, it's a terrible thing that happened.  We had just reconnected.  Uh-huh.  And this just.  So the warrior and, uh, macho?  No, Hogan said this.  Hogan.  Oh, Hogan said this.  I'm sorry.  And this just rubbed the ultimate warrior.  And, well, it should. 
[02:39:30]  The wrong way.  The warrior is obsessed with Hulk Hogan, right?  Obsessed.  And so now, apparently, he's got a 55-minute YouTube video that he plans on putting out about  Hulk Hogan.  Okay.  He released a preview.  What's wrong with it?  Of his Hulk Hogan video.  And this is what we got?  This is where the clips are from.  We love the warrior.  Because he's just.  Is he doing the warrior?  No, he dropped that character.  Oh, that was kind of a character?  Yeah.  Kind of.  Okay.  I don't know what these guys.  I don't either. 
[02:40:00]  I don't know what's real and fake anymore.  I believe everything is fake.  I believe everything is real.  It's the only thing I believe.  So he's talking as a normal guy?  Yes.  Wow.  And making wild accusations against Hulk Hogan.  All right.  Let's listen to this.  The warrior.  Others know it too.  They know that I don't bullshit.  They know that I never have.  On the other hand, you have a long-running reputation for being a liar and a fraud.  It's the warrior?  And a foley.  That sounds like I'm going to lie down.  And this recent line that you've done. 
[02:40:30]  Make you despicable.  Let's get real, man.  You didn't reconnect with Randy.  Why does he have the action movie?  I don't know.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, music.  I think he just found it on, like, a video editing, you know, suite that it was, like, for a free bed.  And he was like, wow, this will really get people excited.  It's in, like, Apple loops.  Yeah.  He just found that.  I've been guilty of that.  Oh, yeah.  And then you're like, what am I doing? 
[02:41:00]  When you first get it.  Oh, yeah.  Um, yeah, Randy was real paranoid.  I mean, when he'd walk through the dressing room, he'd make Elizabeth look down.  Don't look at anybody.  Don't look at her.  I'll kill you.  You know, he always was in character.  And he just was so paranoid of his wife.  And I remember when he first moved down the beach from us, they bought a little house on Kensington.  And, you know, it's a beautiful little house with a big front door.  And all of a sudden, he built a cage around the front door with another locked door.  I'm leaving for six days. 
[02:41:30]  You've got six TV dinners.  Don't leave the house.  Ooh, yeah.  I mean, you're a real piece of shit.  You just recently reconnected with a friend you hadn't spoken to in ten years.  Ten years there was silence between me and Randy.  And you go on that sit-down interview show and you throw Randy under the bus in the hateful, vile way that you did?  Hey, what's wrong with you, man? 
[02:42:00]  What kind of human being are you?  This is really creepy because I don't want to think that the warrior sounds like this.  I know.  He kind of has a weak voice.  What happened to the warrior?  To the warrior.  It's not even associated with any.  Like, this is real life.  Like, this is what he's actually spending his time doing.  Yeah.  But Hulk Hogan kind of, yeah, threw Randy under the bus.  Yeah.  I mean, they weren't...  It didn't sound a bit paranoid.  I mean, the Macho Man put out a rap album with battle raps against Hulk Hogan at one point. 
[02:42:30]  Battle rap.  How embarrassing are those?  Bad.  Really bad.  There's a song called Be a Man that's about Hulk Hogan.  And it's Macho Man rapping.  That's the part of the Macho Man's legacy that we don't think about now that he's passed away.  Oh, really?  You kind of put that aside?  No, yeah.  We forget about that part.  Oh, fuck.  We'll learn about Hulk Hogan's drug use thanks to the warrior.  Yeah, the warrior lets us know about the Hulkster's drug use.  I was there, Terry.  I know.  You and Linda contributed to the fallout of their marriage. 
[02:43:00]  Randy was on the road, turned around with me, night after night.  You were shooting some movie in Florida, something like that, and you and Linda got an Elizabeth's ear that she needed to get out more, go do things on her own.  Kept pressuring her, and it finally happened.  And that was the beginning of the end.  You know, Terry, you get such a sick pleasure out of exposing other people's dirty laundry, taking cheap shots at them.  So I want to do some of that.  There are days, Terry, where you do do nothing but sit around and store cocaine. 
[02:43:30]  Terry, you truly are a dope head.  Wow.  When you have been into getting high and doing dope for years, it was so fearful of confrontation that you assisted other guys in keeping them junkies just so you could have control over them.  Holy shit, warrior.  Is there going to be a lawsuit filed on Hulk Hogan's behalf, I believe? 
[02:44:00]  I would think so, especially since Hogan could use the money.  He might as well.  He pretty much, without saying allegedly or in my opinion or anything, said Hulk Hogan is doing cocaine.  He said that he knows for a fact that there are days when Hulk Hogan spends nothing but do cocaine.  Wow, that's a heavy allegation to make.  And it's the ultimate warrior.  And it's the warrior.  And then warrior finishes by discussing the Hulkster's open matters. 
[02:44:30]  This is going to be a much longer video on all this.  This is just the previews.  Yeah, and apparently, unbeknownst to us, Linda and the Hulkster had an open marriage.  Dirty laundry.  Like that you and Linda had an open marriage.  Oh.  You were both whores and did slutty stuff on the side.  Couple.  Neither one of you had a problem with the other one getting thrills on the side.  In fact, Terry, you tried to get me to sample those thrills. 
[02:45:00]  Oh.  You know, being the only wrestler that said no to so many things in wrestling, I bet I'm the only guy that ever said no to doing your wife.  he just goes on and on  so he's saying that Hulkster  offered up his wife  to the warrior for sex  and the warrior said no  I will not have your wife  unlike everyone else that you've asked  and I am the only wrestler who didn't say no 
[02:45:30]  you think the blue meanie got a taste  he messed up  probably got in there  Andre the Giant  Andre the Giant got to sample the goods  got in there  the earthquake no problem  according to the warrior  wait wait no way  all of them what about what's his name  he used to eat the turnbuckles  George the Animal Steel  that's how he eats pussy  he's just ripping pussy hair out and spitting it out  like he did the turnbuckle  according to the warrior 
[02:46:00]  that's how it went down  oh wow I can't believe it  the warrior also in there said that  Hulk Hogan caused the real life divorce  of macho man Randy Savage  and Miss Elizabeth  how about the guy  the fat slobby guy  that would rub his ass  in wrestler's face  Rikishi  Rikishi  oh do you think Rikishi  you think Rikishi would fucking rub his ass  and win his face  warrior said every wrestler  every wrestler  he should say that  he is a wrestler  not the Brooklyn brawler  he's just a jobber  it had to be the Brooklyn brawler 
[02:46:30]  he was a jobber  oh watch his wife's pussy  brawler just banging away on your wife like that  that's crazy  I don't know if I believe  what about the Iron Sheik  the Iron Sheik  did the Iron Sheik humble  he must have let the Iron Sheik  camel clutch  yeah  he put her in the camel clutch  and fucked her  until she was humble  must have  what about Vince McMahon  well Vince McMahon  has wrestled  you suck  I can't do this  you suck my cock 
[02:47:00]  come on Mrs. Hogan  get on your knees  and suck my cock  that's right  look Hogan  she's sucking my cock  yeah you get it  all around the head  now touch my balls  drip your saliva down my balls  look Hogan  look what she's doing  she's giving me the rusty trombone  you know he tries to do a TVPG product  I know yes  not like the old days  the warrior's saying everyone 
[02:47:30]  the warrior's saying everyone  has done some wrestling  plenty of it  he's a wrestler  you have to assume that maybe  according to the warrior  Brian Kenyon  from Halifax  gives new meaning  to the 1-2-3 kid  I guess so  Pat from Monoges  says Ric Flair came up  and went  woo  after eating her pussy  what was that  I can't tell what he even wrote  it went by too fast  oh when Ric Flair  came in her face  he'd go  woo  that's embarrassing 
[02:48:00]  the word of the day  is slander  yeah  today's word is slander  well  that's what  what about the bushwhackers  oh wow  that gives a whole new meaning  to their name  that's where they got their name  yeah  I'm just glad that this  Hulk Hogan Ultimate Warrior beef  didn't end at Wrestlemania 6  when everybody thought it did  and it was real  and it's just going  and climbing into social media  I'm amazed  this is uh  where did he post this  he posted it on YouTube  on YouTube  was there a video with it 
[02:48:30]  oh yeah  you want to see what he looks like  and he has no makeup on  no  it's just him being real  oh wow  I gotta see what he looks like  I haven't seen him without his warrior makeup on  you want to go behind the curtain  please take me behind the curtain  there's Ultimate Warrior on Arsenio Hall  oh god  that's gotta be great  and doing his warrior uh  voice I'm sure  is he just kind of sitting  is he doing a wrestling  like  like  working the mic thing  or is he just 
[02:49:00]  no he's just sitting  he's just sitting  talking in that normal voice  what an odd thing to  to do  and why is he so mad  as to  expose uh Hulk  for these allegations  that  he's uh  he's putting out there  well he made a video  about the macho man  and how my  how he was upset by it  and then when he saw  Hulk Hogan was also upset by it  he didn't like that  he couldn't just leave it alone  and be like  no there's too much beef  too much beef  and where does that beef come from  Wrestlemania 6  oh really 
[02:49:30]  if you could fill me in  if you could fill me in  what year was Wrestlemania 6  that would be uh  1990 was Wrestlemania 6  and what happened  21 years ago  21 years ago  what happened  that the warrior can't let it go  well uh  that the warrior is  is accusing Hulk  of having some days  where he just sits  and snorts cocaine  the warrior defeated Hulk Hogan  for the world title  Hulk Hogan passed  the proverbial torch  yeah  but  you know  only a year after that  Hulk Hogan was back 
[02:50:00]  in the throne  as number one guy  so why wasn't he mad  at Vince  for having  you know  written it that way  instead of the Hulkster  for regaining  the belt  I'm sorry  you've lost me on that one  what do you mean  oh okay  I understand now  Sam  here you go  this is what  the warrior looks  that's him  oh my god  get the fuck out of here  with all the ultimate  warrior paintings  he  does it  he could pass me 
[02:50:30]  in the street  and I would not know  that was the warrior  but look  I mean  no hair  little in the mouth  it would be like  if Jack Nicholson's house  just had  shining stuff everywhere  like there's ultimate  warrior toys  and paintings  and  oh man  like he definitely  has not let go  of this thing  well I guess  the fact that he  legally changed  his name to warrior  would have tipped us  well that is  I like the half  and half  horrid painting  half of the painting  looks like him  without the makeup  on now  and then the other half  is the traditional 
[02:51:00]  ultimate warrior  you know  that gets a well done  work of art  that looks like  something a child  would do  what  you think  Superfly got in there  oh Superfly  Jimmy Snuka  okay  I mean  did he get up  on the top rope  maybe  and then  jumped off  and plunged  his dick  and plunged  his dick  in there  okay  there she is  there's her  okay  look at those  tits  alright  Anthony  murdering  bitch  look at that  Casey Anthony  yeah  oh wow  he is a weird

[03:01:00]  rodox show we interviewed  yeah  he did me  yes  what'd you learn  interesting family life um  what was your family  background i remember there's  something very interesting  about it there's some kind of  weird religious thing  yeah my parents are  missionaries  whoa wow yeah that's weird  now so they go around and try  to convert people to  catholicism to christian  christianity right that's  they have to live in weird  places i think it crusades  really no they live in  chicago but the book of  mormon you have to move to  africa we learned i know but 
[03:01:30]  they were like lazy  missionaries  you know they're like we're  going to chicago they never  heard of jesus there just  local  yeah  that is lazy  yeah you got to get like  savages that don't know what  the hell is going on yeah  that don't know what a coke  bottle is  wow  i know  so what what does that  entail like what do they  have to do just knock on  doors it like kind of like a  jehovah's witness thing  you know those people who  give out pamphlets  yeah  those are my parents  that was wow  and then i had to start  doing it  no way they forced you to  do it  yeah man  i had to be like do you 
[03:02:00]  want to study the bible  i was terrible at it though  what so wait a minute  what did they think when you  they when you were like i  want to be a stand-up comic  and say bad words and  uh well it kind of came  slowly you know i started  wearing jeans to church  and oh that must have been  like bad  and i was the pianist at the  church you know so  they thought i was like  fucked up  you know because i'm  supposed to be like the  model kid you know  yeah yeah  so  but that never works out  no  when you think the kid's  gonna be like  this is gonna be great 
[03:02:30]  we'll raise her she'll go  to church she'll be a  missionary like us  and then uh  and then now i'm telling  dick jokes on stage  yeah  yeah  are you dirty on stage  i haven't seen you other  than last comic  i am dirty  yeah yeah  good  and i like that when  she came right in and  started dropping the f-bombs  and shit that was cool  your parents go to your  shows  my mom has been  not your dad  no  yeah the  no because i do jokes  about my sex life  i can't  oh shit  that'd be so weird  wow would that suck  he'd probably freak out  right  what would you not  want him to know 
[03:03:00]  i do jokes about  asian guys having  small penises  yeah and he's like  an asian guy  he knows  he's like an asian guy  he doesn't want to  see that  hear that  he knows  so yeah  what don't you want  what don't you want  your parents to know  about your sex life  no my mom can know  but it's just weird  for your  you know  when you're a girl  and you have a dad  it's weird  yeah most girls  i know don't have dads  but korean dads  korean dads are strict  yeah  they are  they are  the i thing was a goof  and a joke  but the korean dad thing  is a real thing  well look at you all  gussied up like that 
[03:03:30]  yeah wow  yeah it's all right  how do they feel about  what you were saying  last time  one of them anime things  they um  yeah no they were cool  with it  i guess  but they weren't  i remember you were edgy  it was like  it was cool to hear that  you know  because you don't hear  ethnic stuff on tv at all  no one does ethnic shit  it's only allowable  if you're making fun  of your own group  yeah  like you're korean  so you can make fun  of asians  or if you're black  you can make fun  of blacks  or irish and irish  yeah they wouldn't  let me do my black jokes  or g jokes  you're kidding  oh damn it  yeah you have to like  email them  email the lawyers  all your jokes  which one wouldn't 
[03:04:00]  they let you do  why wouldn't you do it here  dropping the n-bomb  all over the place  you get me off the hook  with the eye thing  come on  you ain't getting off the hook  with that eye thing  i don't get the eye thing  i know  that you've got  he said like  they got it down  meaning you know  koreans probably  got a good mix  of some kind of  southeast asian thing  going on  and the eyes  look really nice  oh i get it  yeah  i was just bailing him out  i don't know  what the fuck he meant  it's just  it's a personal taste  that's all  yeah  i'm filling you yo 
[03:04:30]  thai women have  really nice eyes  yeah  what's the black joke  i don't know  probably something  about penises  i forget  you do  did they really tell  you couldn't do it  yeah they tell you  what you can't do  didn't you get that too  when you went  i don't know  if i submitted my jokes  i almost never do  um  i did for hbo  for standards and practices  but  there was nothing  they asked me to take out 
[03:05:00]  like i hate doing that  writing out your stuff  yeah  but i know that with language  they're not gonna  hbo's not gonna say  you can't do a jewish joke  or a black joke  they want to make sure  oh you know what it is  they want to make sure  you're not libeling  or slandering anybody  like you can't say  hey so-and-so's a pedophile  they're not gonna let you  say that because  they're gonna get sued  it's true  unless it's your dad  by the way the koreans  they were known as boat people  and the churches brought them in  i can't  you're the same age  you know this  what do i know  well you're all sudden  you had korean kids  running around your school 
[03:05:30]  that didn't speak english  they were brought over here  and they had crew cuts  no  not a one  not a one  not a one  i don't remember  a bunch of people  on instant feedback  maybe i just don't remember  i never  it was frustrating  i became friends  with two of them  and they did way better  than i did in high school  and they didn't even know english  that's because we get  the shit kicked out of us  yeah  you gotta need that  schoolwork has to be  yeah you gotta come back  to like a's  but the church groups  brought them in  well my  my  where i was  brought up  there was a lot of 
[03:06:00]  church things going on  so  a lot of churchy things  touching  no no touching  i thought that's what you meant  yeah i think we  when you say church things  i'm thinking molestation  i really think we lucked out  i don't think we had one of those  yeah  in our parish  you just weren't cute enough  aww  that hurts  that hurts  yeah  i wasn't either  you're cute  no but when i was growing up  i had like  buck teeth and glasses  and nobody molested me  oh you're a propaganda  buster  jesus christ 
[03:06:30]  wow  it just got me off the hook  no it's  that's even worse  than what i'm saying  when you say that  it's like you know  do you have to walk around  with a pointy hat  that's crazy  we like yesterday  that's why we're doing this  we had creepy guys  living in our basement  whoa  why  you know because my parents  were like generous  they were like  jesus loves everybody  we take everybody in  so we take all these  ex-drug addicts  and alcoholics  into our house  we had black people  with a child in the house  with five kids in the house  that's crazy  do you know how many 
[03:07:00]  fucking kids  of parents and missionaries  are like  must get molested  because of the people  they bring around  it's gotta be  how many creepy strangers  tons of people  we allowed black girls  from the city  to live with us  in the summertime  yeah  you know that  out on the beach  the fresh air fund  or whatever  oh the fresh air fund  so all of a sudden  you have a black  that's crazy  i had a black sister  for a while  and then we brought  him to the big pool  first thing he said  to her was  you got the lips  and nose thing  figured out  like i said 
[03:07:30]  a very catholic town  so all the catholic  families got to have  a black girl  for the summer  wow  and then we went  to camp alvernia  you know that  camp alvernia  and set them free  at the end of the summer  we would have  a huge pool party  because they had  a massive  olympic sized pool  that didn't have  a deep end  that's what you need  something about that  swimming  then we'd all  show off  our black people  that we had  for the summer  and who was like  i'm being completely  honest here  was it like 
[03:08:00]  a status thing  like who had  i guess  you know  the black kid  that was better  behaved  or better dressed  i think it was  to make everyone  feel good about  themselves  like look  what we're doing  we're all doing  as christians  white people  are taking in  the black  people are just  dumb  they're fucked up  yeah and then  we brought  and then a few  families  we went to  robert moses  for the day  and yeah  just enjoyed  ourselves  and then like  shipped them  back to the city  never heard from  did you have to  slip an extra  20 to the lifeguard  keep an eye  here 
[03:08:30]  you know how  that swimming  thing is  you didn't bring  any black  no  what are you  killing my house  yeah i've told  you how i grew  up  wow it was  horrible  my father  oh that's all  i heard was  that word  but so  it's fantastic  so i'm just  related to you  wow  we brought in  people in our  house because  my dad was  like doing  you know  cared about  everybody  it was either  everything was  either rigged  that way  or i was that  type of rich  or i was  dressed like  one or i

[03:48:00]  has a stank  were you back  there Eric  when they were  back there  I got back  there right  as they were  leaving to come  up by the  studio  and Roland's  right  we actually  have to  disinfect  the guest  chairs  who smelled  the guy  with the  mustache  yeah  him and the  other guy too  but the  minor  is so  powerful  were they  homeless  they just  no I think  they're just  fans of  homelessness  I think  they like  smell like  poop  like they 
[03:48:30]  don't wash  you're saying  hippies  yeah  you think  they're hippies  what word  hippies  hippie  you don't  like hippies  no  they don't  they don't  shower  and you think  that's the  problem with  Esther Kuz  all hippies  guitar players  all hippies  yes  just smell  like  be-ho  and dirt  like all  they needed  was patchouli  to fix  water's our  friend  so is soap  soap  shampoo  did she really  meet them  in the park  do you think  did you smell  yeah  I mean it is  lingering in here  a little bit  it goes on  and off  like I keep 
[03:49:00]  thinking it's me  I shook one  of their hands  wait they were  homeless  but that's  what I'm  wondering  oh do you  see that  I walked  them around  the long  way  like one  and a half  times  to kind  of air  them out  that was  smart  were they  homeless  I don't  know  do they  have ID  yeah  I think  they're  homeless  they're  just hippies  it was just  a weird  scenario  it still  stinks  we've been  spraying everything  in that office  we have all  the fans  on  we're gonna  have to wipe  down the  couches  it's that  bad  and I also  love the 
[03:49:30]  role reversal  because  like Anthony  will say all  kind of racial  comments  until a  person of  that race  is like  here  like when  the Wirecast  is in here  he'll pretend  he voted  for Obama  but when  there's nobody  in here  he'll make  you know  he'll make  all his  real racial  comments  whereas  Opie  won't make  any racial  comments  until someone  of that race  is in here  like I've  never  he doesn't  talk about  Asian people  until  Esther Kuh  walks in  and he  immediately  starts saying  she got  the eyes  right  were you  panicking 
[03:50:00]  no  you don't  panic  anymore  you figured  she could  hang  yeah  celebrities  that panic  comics  they know  how to roll  with everything  so it's not  not so much  and if they  don't what  it's their  own fault  like they  should know  how to hang  is what you're  saying  yeah  all comics  though  they're never  usually a problem  I mean  it was fun  don't get me  wrong  it was just  very  it was  it was surreal  is the word  for it  I wasn't in  here so I  couldn't  yeah it was  just surreal  like the  conversation  just kept  moving in  every direction  it was almost 
[03:50:30]  like a Bobby  Lee  appearance  will you  back me up  on that E-Rock  yeah  but  Bobby  causes his  own  like weirdness  you think  Opie and Anthony  were a little  more to cause  for the weirdness  on this one  well it's  kind of both  because  I mean  those two  guitar players  and Laney  and all this  was weird  enough as it  was and then  open amp  didn't help  yeah I think  Opie and Anthony  kind of wanted  to make it weird  well what else  were they going  to do with all  this  I mean  I don't know  if they did  the right thing  did you tackle 
[03:51:00]  them as they  were leaving  Roland  I think  they're near  them  Opie and  Anthony  no not  the other  guys  no  no guest  pitches  today  no not  today  no  well we  can finally  talk about  what we  were alluding  to yesterday  with Jada  Pinkett  Smith  yeah  he showed  up I saw  him  yeah I  met him  Will Smith  was in the  building yesterday  I tried to get  one question but  there was no  getting near those  two  you met Will  Smith yesterday  I did I did  he had a lot 
[03:51:30]  of security  around him  well that's  the thing  Will Smith  and Jada  Pinkett  Smith was  booked to do  a couple  interviews here  Hits One  and I think  Al Q and I  don't know  who else  the friendly  shows  the shows  that don't  have bad  reputations  yeah but  it was only  like two  shows  yeah  and then  Will Smith  ended up  showing up  with her  so everybody  was in a  tizzy because  it was like  a secret  tizzy though  like the  general population  of Sirius  wasn't allowed  to know  but if you  walked out  into the  lobby  you could see  the Pinkett  Smith family  had security 
[03:52:00]  guards there  like 45  minutes before  they even  got here  yeah  when did  you find out  that Will  Smith was  coming  probably  around  630  they emailed  the town  department  and they  I mean  630 in the  morning or  in the evening  and it was  on lockdown  correct  basically  they said  don't say  anything  they just  wanted him  to have a  great time  which he  did  yeah  come in  and come out  did he  get harassed  by anybody  no  because  no one  knew  although  I heard 
[03:52:30]  he was  just sitting  in the  lobby  at one  point  like  he was  just  sitting  on the  couch  on the  phone  that's  where I  walked  by  and then  I didn't  realize  he goes  hey  where's  where's  where's  my wife  to go  down there  he goes  alright  thanks man  but then  once you  think  he's  alone  three guys  appear  right behind  him  oh  so  he's  being  watched  all the  time  so  you  were  smart  to  just  be like  oh  right there  so you  got to  have an  interaction  with  Will  Smith  this is  incredible  you're  one of  the few  in the  company  although  the talent  department  did  everybody 
[03:53:00]  in the  talent  department  and he  was  friendly  and  everything  yeah  there  was  a  rumor  that  was  going  around  that  he  was  going  to  insist  on  rose  petals  on  the  ground  who  started  this  rumor  because  I heard  it  from  multiple  sources  that  I  don't  know  okay  did  he  have  because  multiple  people  were  telling  me  that  Will  Smith  had  a  thing  because  Will  Smith  was  here  and  he  had  a  thing  in  his  contract  where  he  had  to  have  rose  petals  on  the  ground  so  I  specifically  went  to  the  lobby  and  checked  there  were  no  rose  petals  this  was a  myth  and  I  think  of  the 
[03:53:30]  myth  yeah  because  there  was  nothing  on  the  ground  but  you  don't  know  where  it  started  or  anything  like  that  was  he  pissed  that  there  were  no  rose  petals  yeah  he  seemed  happy  did  he  go  Roland  do you  know  which  studio  my  wife  is  in  I  would  know  but  nobody  put  down  the  goddamn  rose  petals  I  should  have  said  that  did  mention  Hitch  no  do you  remind me  of Jersey  Girl  when he  was sitting  in the  lobby  when the  athlete  came down  and sat  down  next to him  remember  why would  I see  Jersey  Girl  why would  I see  Jersey 
[03:54:00]  Girl  Eric's  probably  seen  Jersey  Girl  Eric  have  you  I saw  it  once  Roland  try to  have  your  interaction  with  Eric  then  remember  near  the  end  no  of course  not  I watched  George Carlin  part  and that  was it  Eric's  trying to  be  cool  I  think  he  watched  the  whole  movie  I've seen  it five  times  why  you love  your chick  flicks  listen  you talk  about  George Carlin  we talk  about all  kinds of  comedians  we were  talking about  Tracy  Morgan  today  now that  he's got  all this  controversy  what do  you think  do you think  we can get  him back  on the  show  he's doing 
[03:54:30]  Caroline's  in a few  weeks  do you  think  I mean  look  Greg Charles  at Caroline's  is our  boy  I don't  know what  happened  between  this show  and Tracy  Morgan  I know  hello  yes  there you  go  no but  he wasn't  no he  wasn't  doing  the show  I don't  think  I got  him like  five times  before  but Steve  only confronted  him  you're talking  about the  day Steve  went and  confronted  him in  the lobby  right  yeah  but he  was already  the reason  he was  confronting  him  is because  he wasn't  doing  our  show  correct  but when  you confront  a person 
[03:55:00]  in front  of other  people  then he  was like  I'm  definitely  were there  when you  took over  talent booking  for this  show  were there  a lot  of Steve  messes  that you  had to  clean up  how do I  say  what's that  heavy breathing  in there  Eric  you know  something  yes  you're gonna  say yes  there were  a lot  of Steve  messes  you bitch  you're sweet  tits there  were  so how  long  into your  reign  as  talent  day one  okay so  it started  day one  you're like  holy shit  what happened 
[03:55:30]  how long  were you doing  damage control  before you  could actually  start your  reign  day one  no how long  did you have  to do it  for or are  you still  doing it  some little  surprises  pop here  and there  what do  you know  Eric  you just  said still  what do  you know  yeah it's  not as much  as it used  to be  but once  in a while  something will  pop up  and we go  oh yeah  that guy  doesn't work  here anymore  and then things  kind of get  smoothed over  it's kind of like  the buddy  Sean William Scott  we usually text  hang out  all of a sudden  he switched 
[03:56:00]  his phone number  too  Steve lost  a Sean William  Scott contact  well he switched  his phone number  so until he gets  his new movie  he comes back  I'll get his new  number  wow  who  J-Wall  yeah I remember  J-Wall  we talked about  that on the air  who  Scott  Sean William Scott  was there anybody  else that you  remember  that you were  like okay  you can start  coming back  on our show  now  Mike Rowe  wait wait wait  what was the name  that Eric just  mumbled 
[03:56:30]  Gervais  yeah  what happened  there  that was a  long story  Steve ruined  a Ricky Gervais  contact  no but  I fixed  everything  everything's fixed  but it was  broken  did you see him  when I left  did he ever  come back in  no  no he didn't  you bet your  sweet ass he did  and that was  not because he  had a grudge  against the show  it wasn't against  the show  it wasn't against  because obviously  he came back  I fixed things  that's what I do  I fix things  but who broke  them  hello  wow 
[03:57:00]  I can't believe  well  for one  I for one  but I do love  Steve though  we all love  Steve  I hope  I love Steve  he's always been  good to me  this is new  information to me  I'm just getting  it  but I will say  that hopefully  Danny Bonaduce  doesn't like  guests  well  it's in Philly  though  but who's  in Philly  let's take a look  but  are they going to  interview the guy  who burned down  K-Mark or something  I don't know  well listen  we've got to get  to some stuff today  we were talking 
[03:57:30]  about Tracy Morgan  as I said  and there was a time  when Tracy Morgan  did our show  regularly  the last  I think  the B outfit  I don't remember  I think he came  into K-Rock  once  twice  after the B outfit  I think twice  it was once  he came in  normally  the second time  he says  it's hard in here  it's gotten  almost naked  right  because I actually  have a picture  on my phone  of Tracy Morgan  with no shirt on  walking around  the K-Rock studio  during a commercial break  I think that  might have been  his last time  yeah  Tom Jisana  goes  what's he doing  he's hot in here 
[03:58:00]  who said that  Tom Jisana  oh yeah  he is very upset  well  we wanted to bring you  back to a time  when things were simpler  when we had to  walk from one studio  to another  it was back  when we were on  K-Rock  we were doing  K-Rock  and then XM  of course  they couldn't  settle on one studio  most of you  remember this  but we were  actually broadcasting  the walk  from studio  to studio  we would take  wireless mics  and do our live show  as we walked  from one studio  to the other  eventually  it got exhausting 
[03:58:30]  and we just  stopped doing it  but  for a time  we were doing it  and Tracy Morgan  I guess before  he stopped doing  our show  liked our show  enough that he  actually did the  walk over with us  Roland  I remember  you remember him  doing this  we were walking  down the streets  of New York City  Tracy Morgan was there  this was before  30 Rock though  wasn't it  I think it was  during possibly  the first season  maybe right as  it was starting  during the first season  it was  so it was when  Tracy Morgan  was kind of  in that dip 
[03:59:00]  after SNL  before he got  really famous  again for 30 Rock  before 30 Rock  really blew  yeah  so he was in that  maybe he just  stopped doing the show  because he's famous  yeah  you want to tell yourself that  you're going to go  with Steve C  on this one  I'd say  I'd say a combination  of both  but mainly  yes  mainly what  you're a little  shit story  my friend  well you said  yes  is what I'm saying  so mainly  like  it was pretty much  the reason is  no comment 
[03:59:30]  but  Steve C  okay  Sam  if I'm reading  this right  I think  the last time  he was on the show  was in August  of 2007  Jesus  it's been a long time  Roland  you gotta get on  this shit  I'm working on it  right now  mending relationships  yes  broken  by  I'm sending  I sent a gift  over  another gift  over to someone  you have to send  people gifts  how badly were things  messed up 
[04:00:00]  what kind of gift  did you send  Tracy Morgan  the people  do you remember  oh maybe this wasn't  on air either  the Mike Rowe  situation  what was the Mike Rowe  situation Eric  he was not very happy  yeah  tell me about this  situation  where Mike Rowe  was booked on a day  where we were very  guest heavy  and was kind of  unintentionally pushed  into the background  who was the other guest  I think at that time  Victoria Gotti  Victoria Gotti  right  oh so you're saying  that we were 
[04:00:30]  kind of overbooked  yeah  so we had  Mike Rowe  and Victoria Gotti  in at the same time  well Mike was in  before  okay  and we got to him  late  and right as  we were  no we were  talking to him  for a few minutes  then Victoria  came in  so like we had him  for 5 to 10 minutes  and then spent  the rest of the time  talking to Victoria Gotti  correct  the way he said  he waited 2 and a half  hours in the office  yeah  really  because somebody  wasn't really  notifying the studio  that he was  there early  2 and a half  3 hours  he came early  because he wanted 
[04:01:00]  to do the show  somebody said  can you please  come as early  as possible  so he told me  wait wait wait  somebody said  can you please  come as early  as possible  yes  who are you assuming  it was  I don't like  the name  that I didn't  know  I'll call him  Steve Vaughn  to protect  the innocent  Steve what  Steve Vaughn  called  Steve Vaughn  Steve Vaughn  okay  called Mr. Rowe  to come early  and Mr. Mike Rowe  said to me  that he came  very early  woke up early  moved stuff around 
[04:01:30]  and Steve Vaughn  I think he came  close to like  6.30  and he waited  like 10 and a half  3 hours  in the office  and then he got  bumped  and he said  he just made  I'm not sure  if he made it  in here or not  I wasn't here  at the time  yeah he definitely  was in here  that day  okay but he  said it was  like a few  minutes and  then they  left  so is that  so that's why  we were on  bad terms  are we back  on good terms  with Mike Rowe  well before 
[04:02:00]  we're back  in good terms  fantastic  before Roland  did anything  too there were  amends that had  to be made  to Mike Rowe  and to  what do you mean  amends  things had to be  yeah I sent  apologies  gifts  you sent gifts  to him and the  network that he  was representing  wow  this is where  you have to deal  with Roland  everyday  so it's not  only  it's not only  management  it's not only  the talent  but it's cleaning  up messes  from before you  were even here  yeah it's like  people understand 
[04:02:30]  it's like  it's such a  delicate job  you have to  walk the line  between  just give him a  call and tell him  to come on the  show  yeah but you  have to  between the  guys to approve  and the guys  to this  and then everything  goes right  and make sure  everything's  and everything  being shipped  from before  everything's  perfectly fine  it's like  Simon Pegg  I built the  bridge back again  it was a weird  the first time  he came on  right  and we addressed  that yesterday  yeah he killed  it  and it was  great  yeah  well you're  trying to mend  the fences  with Tracy  Morgan's 
[04:03:00]  people right  now  yes  and you're  gonna see  because you  say Steve  C kind of  screwed that  whole thing  up is what  you said  I didn't say  that I said  Steve-on  Steve-on  okay sorry  um so you're  trying to mend  those fences  we wanted to  take you back  to show you  how great  Tracy Morgan  can be  on this  show  it really  is fantastic  when he's  on and  hopefully  he'll be  back  this  is dating  all the way  back to  2006  when Tracy  Morgan  joined us  on the  walkover  we're  broadcasting  on 57th  street  New York  City  live  Tracy  Morgan  walking  down the  street  with us
