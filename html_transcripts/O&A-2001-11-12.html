<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion about a plane crash near their New York City hotel.  The hosts speculated about the cause – mechanical failure, terrorism, or even seagulls – and noted the lack of concern from other cities except Boston, who expressed concern for their well-being. The conversation took a darkly humorous turn, focusing on the crash's proximity to fireman Mike Moran, who had recently given an expletive-laden on-air message directed at Osama bin Laden.  Clips of this interview were played. Callers shared their opinions on the crash and the news coverage, including one who claimed a precognitive nightmare about the event. This led to a protracted, absurd discussion incorporating *Back to the Future*,  with references to dates, times, and the DeLorean.  One caller, Alex, criticized the hosts’ humor, resulting in an angry exchange. The show promoted an Xbox contest and mentioned previously aired, potentially controversial content available online.

The show continued with more *Back to the Future* references and speculation on the plane crash’s naming conventions.  A bizarre in-studio guest delivered a rambling speech connecting the plane crash to the Titanic and *Back to the Future*, referencing her husband’s sperm and a "camel toe." A caller suggested songs that would be banned following the crash ("Radar Love," "Leaving on a Jet Plane"). Another caller, Ryan,  smoked a bong on air. The hosts detailed two Xbox contests: "Cherry Darts for the Xbox," involving women from a gentlemen's club as targets, and "Mommy, What Would You Do to Your Box for an Xbox?". A phone call with a woman who mistook the Xbox giveaway for Donna Summer tickets led to sexually suggestive questions.  The hosts discussed Ozzy Osbourne breaking his leg, drawing further *Back to the Future* comparisons and including a humorous impersonation.  Marianne, a "Little League Mom," recounted sexually explicit experiences at a strip club and a lesbian encounter at the studio, with explicit details, including a "bottle rocket" incident (which was replayed).  Further discussion of the plane crash’s coincidences with *Back to the Future* ensued, including Michael J. Fox's appearance with Giuliani. Emmy Award-winning Paul Mercurio from *The Daily Show* joined the show, discussing his win and contrasting it with Opie and Anthony's past radio award experience.  The conversation touched on the news media's sensationalism and a potential Sylvester Stallone film, "Rambo vs. Osama."

The show then focused on lurid celebrity gossip, specifically allegations about Sylvester Stallone's sexual practices from a book written by prostitutes. The conversation included vulgar descriptions of sexual acts and innuendo. A caller, Tom, made humorous comments about the timing of *Rambo III*'s release relative to the Cold War.  Speculation about a *Rambo IV* plot followed, with jokes about Stallone fighting Osama bin Laden. Another caller, Billy, added an anecdote about Stallone defecating in a hotel shower.  The show discussed the Pope's supposed recent internet discovery and a call from Wanda, from an adult content website. A significant portion focused on Rhonda and her claim of an unusually large clitoris, with a prolonged, explicit discussion about its size and shape, including graphic descriptions and jokes.  A video of Rhonda’s clitoris was mentioned as being online.  Callers, including a self-proclaimed biologist, participated in the debate. The show ended with another announcement of the sexually suggestive cherry dart Xbox giveaway, the playing of the F.U. line, and more calls, including Veena providing a biological explanation for Rhonda’s situation, mentioning intersex conditions.  Further discussion of Rhonda's clitoris and the online video, along with news about the Pope and the internet, concluded the segment.

The final segment largely focused on promoting contests, including the "cherry darts" Xbox giveaway and the "Mommy, What Would You Do to Your Box for an Xbox?" contest. Past contest entries, including a woman shooting a bottle rocket, were recounted. A significant portion was dedicated to "Feels for Meals," a past charity event involving topless women in boxes.  A particularly memorable event involving Wendy guessing which man feeling her up was her brother, with Jim Brewer tickets as the prize, was detailed with sexually explicit detail. The "What do we learn?" segment featured listener calls sharing what they learned that day, ranging from mundane to absurd topics. The hosts also discussed attending a Disturbed concert. The segment concluded with promotion for future shows and contests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show!  Hey!  In the New York area, 877-692-1027, your disaster show!  Holy ass! Anywhere else, outside of New York, 866-277-4, wow, we're a beaten city! 
[00:00:30]  Well, the latest plane crash, 100 yards to our north, actually.  It was so close when it happened.  Jesus Christ, we're a beaten city!  I can't even believe when I woke up.  First of all, I'll tell you, I stayed in town, thank God, because I never would have gotten in from Brooklyn. 
[00:01:00]  No way, no show today.  I turned around and hid in my bedroom.  So, we were staying at the Sheridan, right across the street.  So, I have the alarm set.  It's like 10.04.  What's the matter?  Now everyone knows where Hans stays when he's in the city.  No, I usually don't stay there.  I usually stay at the Parker.  I feel like I'm watching, like, the end of Rosie or something.  When Anthony stays in the city, he stays at the Sheridan.  And then you just said, no, I don't stay there, I stay at that one. 
[00:01:30]  I stay at the Parker.  Jesus.  Or the Novotel.  You can get me there if I'm staying in the city.  Give a call, I'll say hi.  All right.  Anyway, go ahead.  So, I have the alarm set for like 10.04, I guess it was set for.  And it goes off.  It's one of those, you know, clock alarm, clock radio things.  So, it's on one of those stations.  And I hear the traffic guy doing a traffic report at 10.04.  Now, in New York, you know you get it on the 8s and the 1s, depending on what station.  So, the alarm goes off and you hear traffic guy.  On the 4s.  And you look at, and it's 10.04. 
[00:02:00]  And he says, he goes, and we're now coming in.  And then my girlfriend leads over and turns the radio off.  So, that's all you heard.  I'm like, but I'm thinking.  I'm like, there's something strange going on here.  And I'm hearing, weee, weee, outside.  So, then I go, all right.  I remember the phone ringing.  So, someone left me a message on my cell phone.  So, I go to check my messages on the cell phone.  All circuits are busy.  I'm like, uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Last time this happened, it was a couple of months ago. 
[00:02:30]  So, I go, give me the remote.  And I winced.  I actually winced, pointed it to the TV, and hit on to see what it was all about.  And I just see a fire, and American Airlines plane, the text on the bottom.  Ah, this is great.  This is good.  You can't imagine.  You can't even fathom it would be a coincidence and just be a standard run-of-the-mill plane crash after what's happened.  I think it's a coincidence, my friend.  Well, signs are pointing that way, but I don't know. 
[00:03:00]  I'm still holding judgment because you know something?  There's plenty of airports, there's plenty of planes, and there's plenty of other cities that could have a goddamn plane crash.  But why the hell does that have to be New York?  By the way, I have to announce our favorite syndicated city.  Yeah?  That would be Boston, Massachusetts.  Why is that?  Because they were the only station that called to make sure you and I and the rest of the gang on the Opie and Anthony show was okay.  Oh, I'm sure Boston.  I'm still trying to figure out how Boston was responsible for this one. 
[00:03:30]  What happened there?  There's got to be some Boston connection.  The only city that called to make sure you and I were okay.  That's true.  No one else really cared.  We didn't get that call from San Francisco, did we?  No, or Portland.  We didn't get a Portland call.  No one called us from Bigfoot country.  No.  But I was talking to Oedipus, and I go, we're kind of relieved down here because it's looking like it was mechanical failure. 
[00:04:00]  Relieved.  We live in an age where we're now relieved when we find out a complete disaster is a mechanical failure, most likely, instead of a terrorist attack.  Well, you know something, nothing's been ruled out yet, and I'm still kind of leaning toward, I think it was mechanical, but I'm not ruling anything out at this time, Opie, until my investigation proceeds.  They said they found the black box, so they'll be looking at that.  And here's my theory.  Bomb in the goddamn cargo bay. 
[00:04:30]  I don't say that.  But the thing is, that's been a huge issue right now.  They ask you, did you pack your own bags?  Yeah.  Have they been with you?  Yeah.  All right, we'll check them here, put the tagger on it, and there it goes.  Don't say that.  And then they never check if you're on the plane and your bags are on the plane.  They don't even do that.  There's no way they could check.  So I'm thinking cargo door gets blown off.  Where does that go?  Right into the old engine.  Boom. 
[00:05:00]  I don't know.  I'm saying mechanical.  Who am I?  I'm saying mechanical failure and caused by a flock of seagulls.  You think it was the band?  The band?  Should they be held responsible for this?  And I ran.  It was a flock of seagulls, my friend.  They say they have problems at Kennedy with the birds.  Yeah?  Lots and lots of birds around Kennedy Airport.  They get sucked into the engine there.  Well, you know something?  I think that the pilots are trained for stuff like that. 
[00:05:30]  That's just a ridiculous regular engine failure.  You know what I mean?  It doesn't blow the engine off of your wing for the most part.  I don't know.  And then when you're taking off, you can't lose an engine like that.  Let me tell you.  It went straight down, so it didn't even do as much damage as it could have.  Let me tell you something, man.  I think just about every person that listens to the show has flown out of Kennedy Airport.  Yeah.  The plane was only in the air for three minutes.  We've all seen that stretch of land where it hit. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  That little peninsula there.  Oh, when you're coming in.  The Rockaways.  Right.  Sure.  And believe me, for the first two minutes, 50 seconds, everything was fine.  That was a very short trip down.  Which, you know, a little consolation.  I was on the Long Island Railroad coming in.  And the ticket guy, he's taking my ticket.  And all of a sudden he goes, it happened again.  Another plane crash.  I'm like, no way.  What are the odds?  What are the Vegas odds on this happening today?  And why, you know, enough already. 
[00:06:30]  Did you see all...  Here's another thing.  No God.  Wake up, people.  There's no God.  How many New Yorkers have you seen on the news and everywhere else huddled together in mass prayer for our fair city?  How many times do you see this?  How many clergymen have you seen at Ground Zero and at schools and with politicians talking about prayer and how we're stronger than ever and God will be... 
[00:07:00]  All that prayer.  What did it get us?  Another aircraft full of fuel dropped on a town.  There's no God.  There's no God.  I'm just a man.  I'm just a man like you.  Caddyshack reference is always nice.  I wish I could remember his name.  Whatever.  My name's Bob.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My name's Fred.  Fred.  Right?  I'm a man just like you. 
[00:07:30]  Don't say that, brother.  My name's Fred.  I'm a man.  That's what it is.  Hasn't shaved in five or six days.  Of course.  So I'm on the train.  I think a prayer's got you.  So the guy announces it like he's announcing the next stop on the train, Ant.  Everyone just grabs the cell phones and that's why, you know, cell phones all went out.  All the circuits busy.  And everyone's calling home and saying, all right, turn on the TV.  What the F's going on?  And then we're reporting back to the rest of the train.  I was a little reporter for the train ride today, Anthony.  Little reporter.  Huh?  Little reporter for the train ride. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, I would announce what I knew.  And then we're getting close to, you know, crossing the East River there, going into the tunnel to get to New York.  And the train's slowing down.  Yeah.  I'm thinking to myself, we're not making it in, man.  They're shutting down the city again.  Well, they did lock down the city, just not for rail travel.  They shut all the bridges, everything.  Manhattan is a pretty interesting place when it comes to that.  Because you can, especially now with cops at every crossing already, in a moment's notice, you can cut off entry and exit to this city immediately. 
[00:08:30]  It's an island, you know?  So, unlike any other city, you could just stop the flow of traffic.  And they did.  And if you were stuck in that, I'd feel sorry for you, man.  Because on any given day when those crossings are open, it sucks.  Right.  I can't imagine them closing it.  And then you're sitting, what, on the BQE waiting to get on the Brooklyn Bridge?  And the guy steps out and goes, sorry, pal, you're going to be sitting here a few hours.  Now, what the weirdest sight for me was, the train kept going after we found out, obviously. 
[00:09:00]  And you look to the right, outside the windows there of the train, people on tops of all the buildings in, like, the Jamaica area, Jamaica, Queens, just checking out the, you know, the smoking stuff.  That's the thing to do when planes crash into populated areas now.  It's like the in thing.  You just get to your rooftops and check out the show.  And I'm walking uptown and you see the Empire State Building.  Yeah.  I kept looking because I'm convinced, okay, here comes the next one.  That was another thing. 
[00:09:30]  You might as well check it out live this time around, right after hearing what happened.  You're just sitting there waiting.  Let me tell you.  Okay, where's the next guy to break in and going, oh, we're getting another report.  Let me tell the folks at the Empire State Building, and a lot of them listen to our show.  You guys are absolutely insane to continue working in that building.  Yeah.  Insane.  That building was hit by a plane once, many years ago.  Not a bomber.  Was it a bomber?  Yeah, it was a bomber.  Hit by a bomber years ago. 
[00:10:00]  Burst into flames, killed a few people, but you know something?  It's called brick and mortar.  Brick and mortar.  Right.  They don't melt.  And if the impact doesn't hurt it, then it'll stay standing.  Who in the hell in their right mind is like, you know, doing some good work in the Empire State Building without keeping an eye out the window?  Oh, you got it.  Kind of like that scene from the Poseidon Adventure when you see the big wave coming.  You're like, oh, no, instead of a wave, here's a plane.  Oh, that's awful.  Forget it.  You got it.  You know, I wonder how many people in their office turn their desk around so they can now look out the window. 
[00:10:30]  You know, most people like the back to the window, and then people come into their nice office with a view, and they sit and watch.  Spin that desk right around.  You got to be insane to work in that building.  I'd get one of those big fisheye lenses and stick it to the window so you can see what's coming from every direction.  And if you're American Airlines right now?  Oh, just kidding.  Why bother?  Poor sons of bitches.  Why bother at this point?  If I'm the owner of American Airlines, I'm killing myself. 
[00:11:00]  It's over, Johnny.  Who needs it?  They're trying so hard to get people back in the air and back flying.  And this monkey wrench has to be thrown in the works.  The odds were, because it had been a while since we just had our standard run-of-the-mill plane crash, especially one in this country.  I think the last one was what?  Egypt Air left out of New York?  Mm-hmm.  That was 99, was it?  Yeah, about two years ago now.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  And, you know, you kind of forget that every couple of years these things just happen.  But then, two months ago, we have that.  And you're just hoping, all right, lay off.  Or, you know, I'm not saying we should have regular plane crashes anywhere.  But the sad truth is they do happen.  And we're numb, though.  We're numb right now.  How about that Iowa cornfield?  You know, that hasn't been used for a good plane crash site in a while.  Can we do that?  Does it have to be New York?  You know what I say about Iowa, Anthony? 
[00:12:00]  F-Iowa.  F-Iowa.  Well, just, we've had a little bit enough here in New York.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  And, first reaction, like yourself, I turn on the TV, I go, here we go again.  Yep.  Here we go again.  Second point, I'm watching the news.  They're saying this flight was delayed like an hour and change.  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.  It's supposed to leave at 8.  Then it goes up minutes later.  Boom.  Yeah, but every flight is delayed.  Yeah, I know, but, you know, coincidence, my ass. 
[00:12:30]  You know, something's up, man.  What do you do?  What do you do when that flight is delayed?  And then you're sitting there and waiting and waiting.  You're going, I hope they're fixing this.  This time and point, I'd ask myself and say, let me the F out of here.  Yeah, there's always that point where you're on the plane and you go, should I just pick up and leave right now?  Should I just pick up and leave right now and be that guy that got off the plane?  You know?  And then you don't.  Everything goes fine.  Email already going crazy?  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  You guys noticed that the crash happened at 9, 11 a.m.?  It was 9, 14 or something like that.  And then this one's, this rumor or whatever is coming in.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys?  All right.  How about a coincidence like this?  Mike Moran lives right where that plane came down.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sure it's an absolute coincidence.  What was Mike Moran's quote in front of everybody on national TV?  They can kiss my Irish ass.  Exactly.  My royal Irish ass.  Right where that thing came down. 
[00:13:30]  But he did say, you know, Osama, come get me.  I'm right in the Rockaways.  I think he says it.  I'm getting used to it.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  We're trying to find the clip.  This is the part.  Did you guys think of that at all?  A bunch of those emails have already hit.  Yeah.  I mean, that was like one of the first things I thought.  Hold on.  My buddy was Rockaway.  Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark.  I'm going to stop you because we found the clip.  Hold on the line, though.  Here we go.  Here's Mike Moran saying what he had to about Osama bin Laden.  In the spirit of the Irish people, Osama bin Laden.  You clean it right here. 
[00:14:00]  This is my royal Irish ass.  That's all we have of it?  That's all we have?  You did.  I have the rest?  You did say it where you were.  You said, come get me?  That's unbelievable, huh?  As Mark talked in the middle of it.  Thank you.  Yeah, Mark.  Mark, you have perfect timing.  Perfect timing.  We're playing the clip, and you chime in.  I'm sorry, fellas.  That's all right.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  All right.  Have a good day.  You know how huge.  I need the whole clip.  I got to hear Mike Moran say it.  I do want to hear that now.  You know, you can come get me.  I live right in the Rockaway.  You know how huge a story, a plane going down in a residential neighborhood, 
[00:14:30]  would be if it wasn't for September 11th?  I mean, it's still, yeah, a huge story, but someone just was saying how numb we are  for things like this.  Like, I tuned it in on the news, and I'm like, oh, what happened?  How many people dead?  It's like, oh, okay.  You get like, at first, we were all on pins and needles.  Yes, just one?  No, I thought maybe two or three.  I don't know what they're saying everywhere else, but the local news is really hinting 
[00:15:00]  that this was just a major mechanical error.  We don't know.  I'm just saying what has been reported so far.  So just with that little bit of info, you're sitting at your desk or at home going, oh,  that's a relief.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Just one.  I could deal with that.  That's not as bad.  Okay, good.  You hear the F-15s?  Yeah.  That's something.  Boy, them things screaming.  F-15s are circling over Manhattan again.  What the hell happened?  What did I miss?  You know, we got the front row seats to Armageddon. 
[00:15:30]  You could live through life.  You could sit back and live through life during a very boring period of time on this planet.  I'm sure hundreds of years have gone by in certain places on this globe where nothing  happened.  If you're going to live, this is a good time to live.  Welcome to the end of the world.  We're all here to see it.  And this show is here to get you through it.  We'll get you through it.  We're your Armageddon show.  You could have lived in the wild, wild west where the craziest thing that happened in your  lifetime was, you know, an Indian tribe almost attacked your village. 
[00:16:00]  The Injuns got you.  Almost, almost attacked your town.  It was the town over, but they came close.  This is just insane now.  It's really good.  And planes falling out of the sky.  Great.  Mike, what's up?  Where's Earl?  Earl had a vision?  Earl, get a mic.  Earl had a vision.  Mike, what's going on?  How's it going, ONA?  All right.  I want to put a little, I'll leave your fears a little bit about terrorists.  Yeah.  It was an international flight.  Right.  So, by rules, I used to work at the airport. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  All people, all the baggage, they have to be cross-matched with passengers.  Okay.  And all the baggage has got to be, you know, x-rayed and screened.  Each individual bag going into it.  X-rayed and screened.  That's great.  Good, good.  I'm sure it's very thoroughly gone over.  And I'm sure they look at things that could be radio or a razor or something.  And, you know, they don't know it's C4.  Give me a break.  This is just a more mechanical thing. 
[00:17:00]  That plane was delayed from mechanical problems.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Might be the mechanical.  I'm not saying it's not mechanical.  It probably is.  But I'm not thinking automatically that it's mechanical.  Not after what's happened.  It just seems to me like a really bad coincidence.  Sometimes that happens a lot.  There's always been those weird, bad coincidences.  Ugh.  Maybe it was sabotagey.  John, what's up?  How's it going?  Hey.  I wonder if any of the listeners, or maybe you guys know, about a follow-up on that vehicle 
[00:17:30]  that was stolen out of Farmingdale.  That was the aircraft maintenance vehicle company that, uh...  Oh, there's no follow-ups on anything.  I've heard 20,000 stories since September 11th that I get no answers, no follow-ups from.  Where's that crop duster plane that disappeared?  Where's the tanker truck that disappeared?  No one's telling us crap.  A van was stolen, too, from, uh...  Yeah, it was stolen out of Farmingdale.  It was actually on the news and everything.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Okay, guys.  Take care.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Ace.  Ace, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, what the...  Yeah, what the dude said, uh...  Mike Moran, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he goes, uh...  After he did that little kiss-my-ass deal, he takes off his hat.  He says, uh, this is my face.  I live in Rockaway.  Bitch.  Bitch?  Yeah.  I need to hear the clip now.  I know.  We got it somewhere?  We're getting it?  We're actually getting a copy of the Mike Moran clip.  Well, thank you, Ace.  No problem, boys.  All right. 
[00:18:30]  Later.  Do we have, uh...  There's actually a statement from Osama bin Laden?  Where is that?  Look what I did to you again!  Wow, Osama sounds like that.  That's awful.  Uh, let's go to Cleveland.  Kurt, what's up, bro?  Hey, I was telling you guys about, uh...  Think about it, that shaft is spinning at, I don't know how many RPMs, but if a bird  goes through there and takes out one or two of them blades, now that shaft is out of  balance.  And that shaft starts spinning wildly, it could make so much vibration that it could blow that 
[00:19:00]  motor apart.  Oh, okay.  Sure.  Why not?  Well, that's what I like to think.  I'm going...  Yeah, yeah, because you know, there's no screen in front of it or anything like that.  It's just open blades.  I'm going with the flock of seagulls theory.  Flock of seagulls.  Yeah, that sounds good to me.  Hey, you guys suck.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, man.  Uh, Earl, you had a vision?  I didn't...  I had a nightmare.  You had a nightmare?  Yes.  All right.  Earl had a nightmare.  What was your nightmare, Black Earl? 
[00:19:30]  That I was walking...  It was there, driving down the Van Wick, and I'm looking up, and the plane is going overhead.  Van Wick?  And it explodes.  Really?  Yeah.  You had that when?  Last night.  Oh, my God.  I called Creskin.  My goodness.  I mean, I...  I did that because I'm a black girl from the future, and what I did was I transported myself  in the DeLorean.  I went to the future, and let me tell you something. 
[00:20:00]  I saw the plane crash.  Then I came back, but I was going to warn people, but I fell asleep.  I was tired from working on the public file all day.  So now I got to go back in the time machine tonight, go back to two days ago, see the plane  crash again in my vision, and then warn people.  I hope I don't get stuck doing something like a public file or a sticker stop.  I need some energy for my time machine, my DeLorean. 
[00:20:30]  There I was, speeding down the Van Wick in my DeLorean.  I reached 88 miles per hour, and I went into the past.  I ended up at the enchantment under the sea ball when I looked up, and I saw a plane crash  into the clock tower at exactly 10 o'clock.  I had to get my Pepe and my Mammy together, or I wouldn't be born. 
[00:21:00]  And I started disappearing, and then I played the guitar like Chuck Berry, and I saw the  plane crash.  And Biff was trying to get my Mammy.  So I told my Pepe, you punch Biff in the face, and everything will be fine.  I'll be able to go back to the future and tell people about the plane crash, because I saw  the whole goddamn thing.  But then when I got back to the future, I went home, and I was going to call up, I swear,  I was going to call up American Airlines and tell them, don't take off the plane, because 
[00:21:30]  I saw the plane crash.  But I was laid down for two seconds.  I fell asleep, because I was working on the public file.  I don't know what that is, but I was working on it.  And then I went out to the garage.  I had a brand new Toyota 4x4, and a girl that looked real 80s.  And my Mammy and Pepe were older, but they were different.  But all of a sudden, they were cool.  My Pepe was an author, and my Mammy was a great mom.  And the mayor of our town was a white guy that used to work at the diner. 
[00:22:00]  And Biff was out picking cotton in our yard.  That's called revenge.  You know, people died in the plane crash, because I fell asleep, but some good things happen  to Black Earth in the future.  So, school, but I'll try it again tomorrow.  Maybe I'll go to the Old West.  Yeah, the Old West.  Black Earl, you should have helped us out. 
[00:22:30]  So, Earl had a vision.  Black Earl, call me now for your free reading.  I'm going to go on.  Call me now for your tarot card reading.  I'm going to go on record and say that Earl is the only one that has had a nightmare about  planes crashing in the last two months.  Yeah, right?  I've been more than one.  Maybe everyone has had a nightmare at some point in the past two months about a plane crash.  Holy S.  Joe's a pilot.  He wants to talk here.  Joe, what's up, bro?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  All right.  Yeah, I just called and he was saying about the delay that they took. 
[00:23:00]  You know, they took about an hour and a half delay getting out of there this morning.  Yeah.  And he said it was a mechanical prowl.  I'd like to know who he was getting his information from.  I mean, how did you know that?  Did he say?  No.  He just called in with the...  What, the delay?  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard that it was delayed, too, on the news.  Yeah, but he's saying it was a mechanical delay.  I'm an actual airline pilot, and we take delays all the time for a million other reasons  besides a mechanical problem.  You don't sound like a pilot.  Well, I am.  You're supposed to sound like this. 
[00:23:30]  Hey, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be flying at about 32,000 feet.  Oh, yeah.  You don't sound like that.  Give me some pilot talk.  Go ahead.  You're taking off.  Taking off?  What we say to each other, you mean?  Talk to the tower.  You know, tower number one, we're ready to take off.  And they come back and tell us you're clear to go.  We say, Roger, take off.  Clear to take off.  3-1 left.  And then you do our departure procedure.  Well, there you go.  3-1 left sold me.  3-1 left sold you?  Yeah, cool.  Yeah, cool.  Joe, we got to go because we found Mike Moran's audio. 
[00:24:00]  All right, later, boys.  All right, this is what the fire guy there, Mike Moran, said in front of a national  audience.  And I live in Rockwing, and this is my face, bitch.  Oh.  That was at the end of the other clip.  See, now if we put the two clips together, it would be really nice.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  So it went like this.  Go ahead.  Doc Brown's checking in from Hill Valley.  Yeah.  He goes, how spooky.  10-04.  Anthony woke up this morning. 
[00:24:30]  10-04.  Lightning hit the clock tower.  Did it really?  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Is that true?  I guess so.  That's a movie plot.  Anthony, you have to go back to the future.  Oh, no.  Black girl's meeting his pappy.  Pete, what do you have, bro?  You had a nightmare, too?  Oh, my God.  Oh, and I couldn't believe that girl.  I had a nightmare.  Yeah.  I woke up, I looked in the mirror, and I'm black.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wait. 
[00:25:00]  Come on.  No, that's not nice.  That's not nice.  That's not so funny.  Earl, I apologize personally for that for you.  Yes, Earl.  How did I know he was going to say something like that?  Can we play the Mike Moran thing?  Let's play the whole Mike Moran.  In the spirit of the Irish people, Osama bin Laden, you can kiss my royal Irish ass.  And I live in Rockwing, and this is my face, bitch.  Hey, thanks, Mike. 
[00:25:30]  Thanks.  Hey, Mike, could you not say anything about Bay Ridge, Brooklyn?  Let's keep Bay Ridge, Brooklyn off the radar screen.  Let's leave Huntington, Long Island alone, too, while we're out.  Don't talk about those locations.  Now, you know what?  Now, just for a goof, we need to know where around...  Where he lives?  ...where he lives and how close his plane crash was.  Talk about coincidences.  All right, we should take our first break, Anthony.  We're just getting started. 
[00:26:00]  I've got to go back to the future because Biff stole the sports book.  And now he's changed my community forever.  Where the flux capacitor?  All right, a couple things really fast.  Anthony and I, very surprised we're on the air today after Friday's show.  Hey, that was a fun show, man.  Ixnay on the O'Shea.  And there are clips of Friday's show up on foundrymusic.com.  They will not be up there long. 
[00:26:30]  No, trust us on this.  Grab them and put them on your own hard drive.  They will definitely not be up there for long.  So you might want to go to foundrymusic.com and check out the festivities from Friday.  That link is on opiananthony.com as well, okay?  Right.  Also, Anthony, we've got a couple of Xboxes to give away this week.  Xboxes.  We threw around a couple ideas in the office before the show today.  Yeah.  And we'll tell you what you can do to win Xboxes.  I already know. 
[00:27:00]  After we take a quick break here, okay?  All right.  Ball, ball, ball, come on.  Ball, ball, ball, come on.  Ball, ball, ball, come on.  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  What was it?  STP doing revolution.  Yeah, it's a pretty good version.  I like it.  So, reports coming in that Mike Moran, the fireman. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  They told Osama Bin Laden to kiss his ass and showed his face and said,  I live in Rockaway.  Bitch.  He lives about .7 miles from the crash site.  Yeah.  That's just, that's very coincidental.  I don't think that any terrorist would single him out like that and use an airplane for  that, you know. 
[00:28:00]  But who knows?  They're saying about 20 blocks.  Oof.  7 tenths of a mile.  Pretty close.  By the way, would you take that bet in Vegas, Anthony?  Hell no.  What are the odds that would happen?  Here's the bet.  Mike Moran gets on TV, national TV, and tells Osama Bin Laden to kiss his Irish ass and tells  Osama basically what town he lives in.  Right.  If you had a chance to go to Vegas and plunk down some money, where you could win $10 million  if the next plane crash in the New York area was more than 20 blocks away from Mike Moran's 
[00:28:30]  house.  If I had $10 million.  So, you'd win the $10 million.  Oh, how annoying.  The other side of it, though?  Yeah.  20 blocks or less, you die.  Like an over-under.  You die.  Would you take that bet?  No!  You're insane.  I'm taking the bet.  What are the odds?  That's what I mean.  What are the odds?  That's why you've got to go for it.  I'm not betting anything.  By the way, back to the future. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Somebody said that it was November 12th that he had the time machine set for to go back.  10.04 on November 12th.  It was November 5th.  So close, but no cigar.  How do you know it was November 5th?  I checked.  Oh, because it freaked out, right?  It freaked me out a little.  I wake up, 10.04.  I thought I had to, you know, get down the street and zoom.  I'm at DeLorean.  Lots of instant feedback coming in.  Sean from Newark, right?  Speaking of numb, I teach and I actually told my students, I said the words, it was just 
[00:29:30]  a plane crash.  Ah.  Because he's so numb.  Yeah.  Almost relieved to, you know, that it was just a plane crash.  But we don't know that for sure.  Some reporter actually said, thank God it was an accident.  Thank God.  So let's pray and thank God that he killed a couple hundred people and it was an accident.  Yeah.  Thank God.  Tell the families that were waiting in the airport down in the Dominican Republic.  One guy couldn't even stand.  They had to carry him out of the airport.  He was so distraught.  Right. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  I mean, is that necessary?  That's got to be.  Is it necessary to video people that are being carried by other people because they're so grief  stricken?  That's got to be the worst feeling in the world.  You're waiting for your loved ones.  We all have gone to the airport waiting for that flight to come in.  Yeah.  And then what do they do?  What is protocol?  Do they just kind of.  They put you in a room with grief counselors and try to get you through it.  But how do they break the news to you, though?  I think you know the news by the time you get there. 
[00:30:30]  I've heard things where people have been sitting there waiting for a plane to come in.  But, you know, then you look up and you see canceled or it says, you know,  it usually says on time, departed, canceled or something.  It says see desk or see.  Yeah.  So you look at it and it goes, oh, see somebody at the desk.  Oh, OK.  What does that mean?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's kind of.  It's got to be the worst.  Jimmy writes, I just want to know if the remaining Ramones are OK. 
[00:31:00]  That's all I want to know.  This is going back to Earl from the future.  Earl had a nightmare driving down the Van Wyck that he actually made it somewhere on time.  And a lot of people are checking in saying that Mike Moran lives about 20 blocks from the crash site.  The thing is, it was such an out of control kind of situation from what I hear.  It wasn't as a plane steered into anything.  It just pretty much lost its ability to fly and fell out of the sky, you know, straight down. 
[00:31:30]  So I don't think anybody's house is being picked out.  All right, let's go to Tim in D.C.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, nothing much, fellas.  What's up with you guys today?  Well, we're surviving.  That's great.  That's all we can do, you know?  Yeah.  That's all we can do.  I'm just wondering, is it just me or is everybody sick and freaking tired of the news putting this melodramatic music to every bad thing that's on TV?  As well as wanting to tell everybody, hey, we're the first to tell you the bad news.  I mean, what are they, hand out awards for this stuff? 
[00:32:00]  They do, as a matter of fact.  You'll be seeing there are news awards and radio news awards that these reporters just love to win.  I mean, God, you have to watch the news, but it's almost sickening now.  I mean, I don't want to hear all this melodramatic.  I mean, it's bad enough.  Have they named this plane crash yet?  All the news outlets, they have to name everything.  Oh, I'm sure they're going to be just like Hurricane.  You know, they're going to have Javier the crash or something.  America fights back.  Exactly, man.  Well, now they've got a new chapter.  What are they calling this one? 
[00:32:30]  Boy, the graphics department's been busy lately, huh?  Making up their snappy little graphics.  Have you seen, I think it's Fox News or something like that.  They have the little video clip in the upper right-hand corner when they go to a story, like the Anthrax story.  They have some actor that they hired to wear a mask and look over at the camera with the eyes.  And it's very dramatic.  And they have somebody letting the air bubbles out of a syringe.  Like, it's the medical story graphic. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, they just want you to get as scared as you can get, you know.  Of course they do.  I don't know why.  I saw someone on ABC News today running, running in front of his camera in front of some smoke in Queens where the plane crashed.  His hair is flopping.  His tie is crooked.  He just needed to be on the air at that second to say, I'm here at the scene.  And, like, so later on he could go, I believe I was the first one on scene.  Yeah.  Because you know they go back and forth with that stuff.  Well, what would you guys name this plane crash? 
[00:33:30]  I don't know.  Terror from the sky?  No.  Death rains from above?  I don't know what they'll use.  Yeah.  Some kind of fire.  Disaster from above?  I don't know.  Well, they've got to tie it into the whole terrorist thing, just in case it might be related.  False alarm?  I don't know.  It's just a plane crash?  It's just a plane crash.  Oh, God.  With some ho-hum yawning guy graphic.  Right.  It's just a plane crash. 
[00:34:00]  Ugh.  Despicable.  Thank you, Tim.  Hey, God bless, guys.  All right.  Psycho Mark breaking in with some news.  Ah, Psycho Mark.  Hey, Mark.  How about mufflers and small steering wheels in Jamaica Bay?  What?  Never mind.  Sorry, Daniel.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  You're cursing.  All right.  You know, I just got that.  You know, I'm down the ground.  Hello?  Mark?  Mark?  Hello?  We lost Mark.  Hello?  Mark, you there? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, I'm right here.  Oh.  Is it true?  All right.  I got a couple things to ask you, but do you have some info about the crash there?  Oh, it's just how stupid are all these reporters?  It's just idiots.  I have no info.  I mean, no more info than anyone else would.  These guys, I guarantee, they're sitting at their desk, and they were so excited this  happened.  They couldn't get out there fast enough.  Have you guys seen the new graphic on Channel 2, the yam bag off the chin graphic?  What are you talking about?  My favorite.  Mark, you know. 
[00:35:00]  Holy shit.  You were saying in the New York papers today that people are overusing drugs because of  9-11.  I think you're one of them.  What about before?  Well, now you're overusing, my friend.  I don't want.  What do you do?  Is it true you bought a parachute?  I know.  I haven't bought one yet, but I...  I heard you have a parachute.  We heard you bought a parachute, because you do live pretty high up.  No, I haven't bought one.  It was a base jump unit, but I was going to buy.  A base jump?  Oh, so that's like one of the... 
[00:35:30]  You hold the drag chute?  Correct.  And then you just let it go.  Right.  You know, like a couple hundred feet.  Would you have enough time, though, you think?  Oh, sure.  I'm one of those.  I've seen those guys jump off everything.  I'm going to try.  He's going to give it a whirl.  All right.  I mean, what's the difference?  I mean, what?  You take the 3-0 shot.  You take the chance.  You know something?  They have been selling these parachutes to people that are working in high-rises, and people  are buying them, and I've heard this from people that jump regularly. 
[00:36:00]  They're in clubs or the military.  They said, this is an awful thing.  All it's going to do is get people killed.  Now, if you have the choice between jumping out of a building with or without a parachute,  which one are you going to pick?  I'll give you a minute.  Gee, let's scratch our head for a second.  Yeah, exactly.  It's going to get them killed.  Jump without it.  Tell that to the people in the trade center, that jump.  I'm sure a couple of them would have liked to have taken their chances with a little bit of silk. 
[00:36:30]  Dude, if those people had chutes, I bet you hundreds of them would have survived.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I was just going to say, all you have to do is, I like, life stations.  You put them on each floor of the building, you know, and you get a chop siren and a hammer  so you can smash the window out and you jump.  Right.  You're going to see some funky-looking people with that thing on ass backwards plummeting  with a squidded-up parachute.  No, but what I was going to say is everyone's abandoned ground zero today. 
[00:37:00]  There's not a single person down here.  Well, they're all in Queens.  I know.  Geez, they're scraping mufflers out of that person's basement.  That's it.  All the Dominicans bringing back their small tires and stuff.  All right.  You are just an awful man.  Mark, thank you.  Bye.  You had nothing today.  Admit it.  You had nothing.  He's just an awful, awful man.  Anthony, West Coast Dave?  Yeah.  This plane crash should be called Flight 587.  Flight 587.  Sometimes S just happens. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's true.  In the middle of chaos, sometimes it's just you get another little pocket of chaos.  Rockaway burning.  There you go.  That's a good one.  Call it that.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  And just to back up on your back to the future point.  Yeah.  November 5th was the day he went back to 1955.  And then, of course, the dock bag just had on the wall, on the toilet, came up with the flux capacitor.  But a week later was the day of the clock tower striking, which is November 12th. 
[00:38:00]  No way.  No way.  I swear.  I swear.  Just stop.  Remember, next week, we're sending you back to the future.  Back to the future.  Wait a minute.  I'm looking at all kinds of back to the future sites.  And all I can see is the date Marty travels back in time to, November 5th.  Okay.  Yeah, and then a week later.  And then a week later.  He stays a week. 
[00:38:30]  Crazy, huh?  He stayed a week because he ought to stay for the dance.  You guys suck.  Take care.  Why is there a strange back to the future tie-in with my life here this morning?  The 10.04 thing is right, Tim?  10.04 was, yes, I looked at that.  It was 10.04.  Your alarm clock went off at 10.04 in the hotel.  10.04.  And that's when you heard the traffic reporter saying something.  Yes.  Before your girlfriend shut off the alarm clock.  And then you turned on the TV to see this disaster. 
[00:39:00]  And I knew none of this until after I went off on the Earl Back to the Future tie-in.  Oh, man.  Let me go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Libyan terrorists.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Come from your perspective about the news is that this morning, just watching a couple  of the channels, one of them channels are reporting that the fighter jets were dispatched  to the area, quickly hyping up the story, saying that the fighter jets were dispatched to New  York City about reports of something happening with the aircraft airplanes today, when, in 
[00:39:30]  fact, the fighter jets were actually on a routine sweep of New York City.  Another station turned around.  They have a captain who's flown the 8300 Airbus before.  Can I tell you guys something?  I've got to interrupt you.  Yeah.  The news stations, you know, the radio stations that do all news all the time, and these TV  stations, they are all praying that this is another terrorist attack.  Trust me on that. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, I know.  They wouldn't commit to saying, like, all the information that's coming in that says it's  mechanical, they keep saying, but, you know, we're not saying that it is mechanical yet.  They are hoping.  It's business for these news stations.  If this is another terrorist attack, the ratings are going to go through the roof like it did  the last couple of months.  That means a lot of money for these news stations.  At the end of the day, the news is there to get their ratings.  Right.  One of the guys who talked, they started asking this captain, well, this is a case of the  airline association not teaching pilots how to handle planes during this situation. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  And the captain turns around and basically tells them, well, yes, we're trained to fly planes  that have both engines.  Right.  No, when a plane loses one engine, there's no control over it.  It just drops from the sky.  Right.  Not necessarily.  Micah, I would leave you on the air longer, but your accent is really throwing us off,  so we're going to let you go.  Ah, thank you.  Bye.  All right, bye.  Open.  Tom Broca, NBC Nightly News. 
[00:41:00]  Fire from the sky.  Oh, wait, we're changing it?  Okay.  Death from above.  No, what?  We're changing it?  Yeah, we're changing it, Tom.  All right.  It's raining planes.  No, no, no.  No, no.  No, no, no.  Winged flaming bird of death.  No.  No.  Earl's vision.  Earl's vision last night was a plane crashing.  Earl, of course, went home about 9 to 9.15 and had a tall glass of scotch. 
[00:41:30]  This just in, flight 587, 5 plus 8 plus 7 equals 20.  9.11, 9 plus 11 equals 20.  Enough said.  Tom Broca, NBC Nightly News.  It seems Earl will have to go back to the future in the DeLorean, DeLorean, the stainless steel car. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, I'm here in Manhattan, bitch.  You could kiss my royal Irish ass.  Tom Broca, NBC Nightly News.  Hey, Ingo Sama.  Come and get me, you bitch.  F***.  Whoa.  All right. 
[00:42:30]  Well, here we go again.  5 plus 8 plus.  Yeah, I guess so.  People, you know, it's like those nutty, obsessive, compulsive people that just count all day.  5 plus 8 plus 7 is 20.  9 plus 11 is 20.  9 plus 6.  Then 2.  Divide.  Divide.  Divide it.  Thank you for that.  Yeah.  And then people are saying, I heard this on the news too.  Thank God there's churches and schools in the area.  And thank God they weren't hit. 
[00:43:00]  It's a holiday.  They're empty.  Wouldn't it be better if it got hit in an empty building instead of houses with people  in them?  Thank God.  Thank God it didn't hit the church.  The plane took out a few houses.  What about those people?  I know.  And then they look for survivors, which is just...  What about the guy filling up his tank and all of a sudden the jet engine just kind of  rolls up next to your SUV?  You have to move that.  You have to move that.  I cannot pump gas with that here.  Some dopey Haji probably went out and put a gas pump into it. 
[00:43:30]  How much?  Cash or credit?  Yes, my friend.  That is strange car.  Are you Earl?  What is this?  Time machine?  Earl Stradamus.  Here's my quatrain.  I have another quatrain.  I see a plane crash. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, Earl had a nightmare last night that...  Earl might have exploded over the Van Wick Expressway.  Like, in the past two months, we haven't seen so many visions of disastrous plane crashes  that maybe they get in your dreams.  Earl!  Earl!  You got to shining!  Me and my grandma had to shine.  We'd carry on whole conversations without talking.  You got to shining! 
[00:44:30]  Now, I'm going to come to the Overlook Hotel.  Tell your old pappy not to hit me with an axe.  Mark!  Yeah?  What's up?  Red rum.  Go F yourself.  Yeah, Mark.  Red rum.  What's up?  Yeah, the whole Back to the Future thing, it's just kind of creepy.  Well, yeah, I got to tell you something.  You know, no other news station will give you the Back to the Future theory. 
[00:45:00]  That's what you get from the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, that's true.  I went with the Flock of Seagulls theory, and I think Anne is now changing his to the Back  to the Future theory.  Yeah.  And you're an expert on Back to the Future.  Yeah.  Okay.  Do you see anything else?  It's hard to say.  Unless somebody actually does go back in time, I don't think anything, much more is going  to come of this.  Oh, really?  You don't...  It's just, you know...  Idiot. 
[00:45:30]  Another Mark with nothing for our show today.  Thank you, Mark.  All right.  We have to take a break, Anthony.  All right.  We have to explain how we're going to give away these Xboxes.  Yeah.  Came up with a couple good ideas.  Well, all right.  We'll talk about Ozzy.  Ozzy hurt himself.  We can do that next.  And more of your phone calls.  The phones are just ringing like crazy, so I'm assuming you know the number.  And a lot of people are looking for the videos and the pictures from Friday's show, the show  that should have got us kicked off the air, Andy. 
[00:46:00]  Well, still up in the air on that one.  Pictures and video are up on foundrymusic.com.  It's going to be a temporary thing, I'm telling you.  They're going to make us take that stuff off there, okay?  Yeah.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  You can go to opianthony.com for the link, okay?  All right.  We'll be back.  I am Dave.  I'm Perry.  Steven.  And we're Jane's Addiction.  This is Jane's Addiction.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Anthony and Opie.  And you are listening.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:46:30]  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the O&A Show.  Alex, very pissed off at us today, Anthony.  Why is that?  Alex, what's up?  Oh, what's up?  You tell me, man.  Well, you guys are making fun of all these people to make sure that they didn't land on a house or on a school.  I mean, it doesn't make any sense.  There were 260 people that died on the plane.  Yeah.  Oh, I understand.  It's a serious tragedy.  Then why are you guys making fun of it?  Make sure they didn't land on a school or something because it was dead in the day. 
[00:47:00]  No.  Alex.  Oh, you're hungry.  Alex.  Someone said that in the press, that thank God it didn't land.  See, that's what happens.  A school or a church.  Yeah, but they...  Oh, wait.  He's back now and I hung up on him.  Alex.  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  You guys are sitting there going, what are we going to call this?  We're going to call it...  What kind of crash are we going to call this?  That's what the news does.  There were 260 people died.  Are you a stupid son of a bitch?  Are you listening to us, you idiot? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, I am listening to you.  That's why I'm telling you.  What about if your friend was on the plane?  Oh, my God.  Oh, your brother.  Listen, listen, listen.  What about if your brother was on the plane?  Will you be happy?  We're not.  You wouldn't be making fun of it, right?  Hey...  Oh, you know what it is?  Hey, Alex.  You know that we're Spanish people going to put a wrinkle in.  Oh, right.  That's what it is.  That's what it is.  Wow, boy, you finally figured that out.  That's why you guys make fun of it.  Hey, Alex, you douchebag.  What's up?  First of all, I go out with a Hispanic girl, so that's Ron, you asswipe.  I'm surprised they go out with you.  You're such a douche. 
[00:48:00]  Tom, you're saying what?  You're not even listening to our show.  You seem to be listening with half an ear because what we were doing, we were talking about news people on TV and on some radio stations that are making those comparisons and saying those things.  And you guys forget that people die to be able to talk about that.  That's what the news stations are hoping, that it's a terrorist attack because they love this crap.  But you guys are planned right into it.  You guys are planned right into it.  We're talking about what the news is doing with this thing. 
[00:48:30]  And you planned right into it.  You planned right into it.  Alex, you're doing the same thing we were doing.  I'm just telling you that you guys are not planning.  No, Alex, Alex, Alex, Alex, you're not even...  I'm out of this conversation because this guy is just annoying me.  Alex, you're a twat.  You're not even listening to us.  I am listening.  And for you to say that we're goofing on it at all because it has something to do with Spanish people, you're out of your effing mind.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Well, I don't think that it would be...  If the plane was going to San Francisco, you guys would be making fun of it.  Oh, I'm still... 
[00:49:00]  I don't think so.  That's twice, dude.  That's twice.  Hey, hey, hey.  But, you know, let's think about the people who die and not make fun of what happened.  And only wish it was you.  That's what we'll do.  We'll think of the people that died and wish they were spared so you would die.  Alex, not everything that happens in life is about racism.  All about ratings.  Yeah, that's it, Alex.  It's all about ratings.  Alex, no one's listening to us today, you idiot, because you're all listening to the news stations or watching us on TV, so it has nothing to do with ratings, you dick. 
[00:49:30]  But it's all about ratings, isn't it?  But it's all about ratings.  You guys want to just make the ratings.  That's all you want.  What makes you any different than the newsstand?  You're right, Alex.  Alex, there you go.  You're right.  You're so ignorant, it's not even funny.  I freaking hate people like you.  He's the guy that doesn't listen.  But it's okay, Opie, because you know something?  He's probably like this in life, too, and everybody that deals with him and he deals with knows that he's a dick.  And he can't carry on an intelligent conversation because he doesn't listen.  Isn't that right, Alex?  That's all we talk about rating. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  That's what is important.  Don't listen some more.  Go ahead.  Get everything else wrong that you've discussed here.  Go ahead.  Sounds good.  Get everything else wrong.  Bye, Alex.  Bye.  Please, God.  Let me pray.  Please, God, if you have to make another plane crash, because I know you work in mysterious ways that we don't understand.  But, God, if you have to make another plane crash, please make a crash on Alex's head.  Directly.  The nose cone of that plane.  Just have it smash through his ignorant skull. 
[00:50:30]  That crap, you know, I hate when people do that crap, too.  You're making fun of this because it was a plane filled with Spanish people.  That's what it is.  Well, that's why a lot of people don't take racist issues seriously.  It's people like that.  I swear to God.  That's why.  Because it's the cry wolf syndrome.  Every situation that happens, you got a racism.  What?  Pratt and Whitney was racist for making an engine that blew up. 
[00:51:00]  What?  You know, you might as well say that.  What an idiot.  At this point, we're numb.  We're numb in this city.  What a jackass.  I was on a train today when I heard this news, and I felt like my heart was just ripped out of my chest.  Okay?  We are effing numb at this point.  Opie, more strange connections between Back to the Future and the disaster.  Hill Valley, Rockaway Beach.  Both have two words in the name.  DeLorean, jet aircraft, both stainless steel. 
[00:51:30]  DeLorean and jet, both can fly.  Do I have to say another word?  We got Eric from Boston.  Eric, what's up?  Yeah, I have nothing.  I have no life.  So, basically, I flipped on the tape, and I have in queue November 12, 1955.  9.28 in the morning, I believe.  Excuse me?  I also see the hour is 9.28.  The one that I have says October 26, 1985, and then it's like some time for the future, you know, a destination time. 
[00:52:00]  And then the time that he's taken off is November 12, 1955.  It's 10.03 p.m.  Because it's at night.  Right.  It's at night, because remember the lightning storms at night?  I get you.  Sorry.  Hey, Dave, let's steal a plane.  It'll be a great promotion. 
[00:52:30]  Other people doing Rocco's voice.  How you doing?  Dave, I stole the plane like you told me for ratings, and now I don't know how to fly it.  What do I do?  What do I do, Dave?  Dave, dude.  You said this was going to work, but I don't know how to fly.  Good one, Eric.  Thank you.  I'm picking a new partner.  I'm going to crash into a neighborhood, and that'll be my new on-air partner.  It says here that Biff steals the DeLorean and goes to November 12. 
[00:53:00]  I don't understand what that has to do with anything.  You can stop at the back of the future references.  Anthony, the name of the movie on the marquee when Marty goes back in time is Watch the Skies.  Oh, my God.  Is it?  Yes.  Wow, that's kind of creepy.  Watch the Skies.  Our back to the future theory has legs, I'm thinking. 
[00:53:30]  I think it does.  I think investigators ought to get right on this.  Mike from Rochester writes,  Anthony, I heard when the plane hit the ground, the houses that weren't hit were shaking like Michael J. Fox.  Oh, stop.  Come on.  Another back to the future coincidence from Mike from Rochester.  Justin, this just in, Earls, I had a dream speech bigger than Martin Luther King's.  And finally, Anthony,  Jamie from Boston writes, 
[00:54:00]  songs that will be banned because of today's plane crash.  Oh, okay.  Radio likes to do this when we have these tragedies.  It happened with the 9-11 thing.  A lot of stations weren't allowed to play a lot of songs because of what happened.  Songs that will be banned because of today's plane crash.  Radar Love.  Leaving on a Jet Plane.  Manic Monday.  Right Next Door to Hell by Guns N' Roses.  And Burning Down the House.  Right.  That's from Jamie.  So, Anthony, we got a guest in the studio that wants to calm all our nerves. 
[00:54:30]  Thank God.  We need it.  Because most of us have survived another,  another, I don't know,  attack?  Yeah.  In the New York area.  Oh, look at that.  Hello, everybody.  This song was originally written and performed  for those few that went on after the Titanic  slipped below the murky depths of the North Atlantic. 
[00:55:00]  But I think we can all relate now  to living through disasters  and truly being survivors.  like my husband René's sperm surviving his cancer  and his unit surviving the deep plunge 
[00:55:30]  into my camel toll  when we saw the plane hit in Rockaway Beach  and leave a big gash in the landscape  much like the big gash in my lap  with the huge camel toll  that has been carved out. 
[00:56:00]  Wow!  We realize we must pull together  as people  and survive.  We will be dealt  these adversities  much like those people  on the Titanic  on that fateful day 
[00:56:30]  in April  much like November 12th  when Doc Brown went back  and the terrorists shot him  but he put on a bulletproof vest  because Marty told him  in a letter  that he would be shot  by Libyan terrorists.  He put the vest on  reading the letter  contrary to his beliefs  that it would cause a paradox  and destroy the world  but he read it  put on the vest  and he too  survived.  And we too 
[00:57:00]  go on  and survive.  Everybody  feel  through the door!  So remember  this goes out 
[00:57:30]  not only to those  who perished  but to those brave  survivors.  Like those in Hill Valley  that survived  and those  that survived  in Rockaway Beach.  Wow!  Ah, Ryan, what's going on? 
[00:58:00]  Hey, how's it going, my man?  Yes, Ryan, you're so high for it.  Hey, I'm out here in Boston, right?  Yeah.  And, uh, I don't know,  hey, your show Friday  was awesome.  Ah, thanks.  I'm out here actually.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Anyway, what's up  with all these plane crashes?  We don't know  what's up  with all the plane crashes.  What is up  with all these planes?  I don't know, man.  It's freaking me out, though.  But I got a bong 
[00:58:30]  here written  with your name on it.  Ah, right.  That explains everything.  Any chance  of ripping it on the air?  Yeah, he says  he wants to do  a bong hit for America.  And look at the time.  420.  I'm sorry.  Hey, watch the F-word!  All right, I'm sorry.  Yeah, it is 420.  Jesus.  All right, so can I rip this?  Yeah, go ahead.  All right, hold on.  For America,  Ryan wants to do  a bong hit, Anthony.  Right.  Ooh, nice one.  There you go. 
[00:59:00]  All right, no,  I just filled it.  Two feet.  All glass.  Okay.  There we go.  That's for you guys.  All right, thank you.  You guys rock.  All right, thanks.  See you later.  Bye.  Oh, thank God.  I feel safer.  Hillary Clinton is  at the scene, Anthony.  Oh, thank God.  All is well in New York.  Hillary Clinton is  on the scene.  It looks like she  didn't wash her hair today. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  That was nice.  Wow.  Biff Tannen  and Bin Laden.  All right.  All right.  Enough said there, too.  Biff Tannen  and Bin Laden.  Ian.  Yo.  You're next  to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:00:00]  What's up?  Yeah, were you with  the Enchantment  Under the Sea dance  last night?  We missed it, unfortunately.  Earl went, though.  Earl went back  to the future last night  and had a dream  about the plane crash.  Then got in the DeLorean  and came back  and fell asleep  and forgot to tell everybody.  All right.  All right.  That would have worked out  if you guys were  at the Enchantment  Under the Sea dance.  Otherwise,  I don't know about the series.  Yeah, I understand.  All right, man.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Can we explain  how we're going to give away  the Xboxes this week?  Yeah.  We really need some fun. 
[01:00:30]  Mm-hmm.  We have lost our effing minds  here in New York.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know,  it's just making us  more hardened.  Our nerves are pretty frayed  at this point.  It really is.  No joke.  It's getting a little weird.  Anthony?  Yeah.  We got a couple of Xboxes  to give away this week  and we got a couple of good ideas.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, we do.  Should be a lot of fun.  We came up with  the contest.  Yeah.  For the first one,  we got two.  Cherry darts for the Xbox. 
[01:01:00]  Yes.  Cherry darts for the Xbox.  Cherry darts.  Mm-mm.  Remember when the ice cream  lesbian girls were in?  Who can forget?  And we got to throw  the whipped cream cherries  at certain parts of the body?  Whipped cream  and dipped in cherry sauce.  They brought a bunch  of different sauces.  Sauces.  Sauces.  And we had cherries  which we were dipping  in these different toppings  and sauces.  Mm-hmm.  And throwing them  Right.  at vital areas  that were very well exposed. 
[01:01:30]  I believe they even made  little dart boards for us.  Yeah.  I know Opie  hit a direct shot  into the balloon knot.  Yes, I did.  It was so direct  that cherry stuck  and just went thwock  and completely covered  the balloon knot.  It was a perfect bullseye.  Yeah.  Ah, wonderful.  Well, we're going to do  something very similar  for the Xbox.  Yes.  Cherry darts for the Xbox.  Yep.  Going to invite  some listeners down  maybe as soon as Wednesday  or Thursday 
[01:02:00]  and they get their shot  at the Xbox.  Closest to the box  wins the box.  That's right.  That's it.  Simple as that.  It's easy.  Simple as that.  So, we're going to need  some fine ladies.  I think we'll just get them  from Privileged Gentleman's Club,  right?  Ah, shaved.  Yeah.  We want them completely shaved.  None of that pesky hair  to get in the way  of marking the area  that the cherry hits.  Right.  So, I believe we'll get  the girls from  Privileged Gentleman's Club  because, quite frankly,  the female listeners  let us down 
[01:02:30]  when we tell them  that we need their help.  Right.  A bunch of ladies  will call and say  I'll be the target  and then they don't show  and then we look stupid.  So, we're going to cut  our losses  and we'll just get  some fine ladies  from Privileged Gentleman's Club  to help us  with this little contest.  Yeah.  Then we'll have  some contestants  come down  and take their shot  at the Xbox.  Mm-hmm.  Take a shot  at the box  for the Xbox.  Right.  With the cherry darts.  Cherry darts.  Do you like it?  I like it.  All right.  We're going to have  to throw a couple ourselves 
[01:03:00]  to warm up.  Oh, just to kind of  show everybody  how it's done.  Show everyone  and demonstrate  how it's done.  I want to see  if you can top yourself  from last time.  I remember you're  quite good at darts.  I used to be on the league.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, we'll do the cherry darts  for the Xbox.  Maybe even have a  get ready with the wacky horn  a couple booby prizes.  If their cherry darts  go awry.  Yeah.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  So, we're going to do that  either Wednesday or Thursday.  Then, we have another  Xbox to give away. 
[01:03:30]  And, we're thinking  we're going to just  throw this out there.  A lot of mommies out there  want to get their hands  on the Xbox for their kids.  Well, sure.  It's a great Christmas gift  this year.  I'm sure a lot of Xbox  is going to be  under the Christmas tree.  But, for those few  that can afford it.  That's right.  Because it is a  it's kind of a  high-priced item.  Pretty expensive.  So, we're going to  throw this out there  and see if it sticks,  so to speak.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  A simple contest  for the other Xbox.  We're definitely doing  the cherry darts  for the Xbox.  That will happen 
[01:04:00]  either Wednesday or Thursday.  We just got to figure out the date.  We have another one  just kind of floating out there  and we want to see  if the mommies  would be into this.  Sure.  Mommy,  what would you do  to your box  for an Xbox?  Not even going to  explain the contest, Anthony.  Right.  Just going to throw it out there  and see if anything sticks.  Throw it out.  Mommy,  what would you do  to your box  for an Xbox?  Mommy,  what would you do  to your box  for an Xbox?  Right. 
[01:04:30]  That's wonderful.  And mother's got to  keep in mind that,  you know,  your kid maybe  is getting a little older  and he's doing  his own thing now,  right?  Right.  Used to be mama's boy,  maybe.  Correct.  And, you know,  maybe he can't afford  the Xbox.  Maybe he really  wants it badly.  You can get his love  back through the Xbox.  You just have to,  you know,  come up with something  you want to do  to your box  for the Xbox.  Right.  Yeah.  That's all we're saying.  That's it.  So we got two Xboxes.  One will definitely do 
[01:05:00]  the Cherry Darts  for the Xbox contest.  And then the second one  will do,  Mommy,  what would you do  to your box  for an Xbox?  Right.  All this week  on the Opie and Anthony show.  What is that picture, Earl?  Earl Stradamus.  Earl,  they got Earl  dressed up as  Nostradamus.  There it is.  All right,  we're going to take  another break, Anthony.  All right.  Okay.  As we take a break here,  the famous Donna Summer  phone call, Anthony.  Donna Summer.  Stupid lady calling us  thinking that we were  giving away  Donna Summer tickets,  concert tickets,  and this is what happened. 
[01:05:30]  Hi, Annie W.  Am I the right caller?  What were you calling for?  Donna Summer tickets.  Donna Summer tickets.  Are you a big  Donna Summer's fan?  Yes,  but I'm more of a  .5 fan.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  She knows the right  things to say.  Here we go.  Let me tell you something.  Mm-hmm.  You're going to see  Donna Summer.  You're kidding.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Matter of fact,  we're going to put you  in the front row.  Absolutely.  For Donna Summer. 
[01:06:00]  What do you say?  I don't believe it.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Hey,  what color panties  are you wearing?  I'm wearing a bathing suit.  Donna Summer wants to know.  What kind of bathing suit  are you wearing?  A one-piece,  a thong,  a bikini?  A bikini.  I'm suntanning.  Suntanning.  And then by my pool  is my radio  with .5 on.  Oh, boy.  She says it again.  Look at that.  Since she's mentioned  the station so many times,  I think another prize 
[01:06:30]  is in order.  You like the disco era?  Yes, I do.  The whole disco dancing thing?  Absolutely.  How about a disco weekend  in Las Vegas, Nevada?  Yeah!  That's right.  You'll be whisked away  to Las Vegas, Nevada  to see Donna Summer  in Las Vegas.  Are you serious?  We are serious.  I can't believe this.  You just have to tell us  one thing.  What?  What's the strangest object  you've ever used  during sex?  The what?  Donna wants to know. 
[01:07:00]  Nothing.  You're a virgin.  No!  You're a big,  fat virgin.  Yeah!  You're a big,  fat virgin.  And what's your favorite station?  25.  She said it again!  You know what you're  going to win now?  What?  A trip on the space shuttle.  Yeah!  The first person in space!  You're going to see  Donna Summer  on the space shuttle.  Isn't this fantastic?  Oh, this is wonderful.  Have you ever been  on the space shuttle?  No, I haven't. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, it's beautiful.  Yes.  Fantastic.  It's going to have  a big disco ball.  They're going to  decorate it all.  Hey, do you know  how to dial a phone?  Yeah.  What's your favorite  sexual position?  Hello?  Donna wants to know.  Hello?  Oh, no.  Is she hanging up finally?  She's gone.  Oh, my God.  It took forever.  O.B.  You guys are gone.  And Anthony.  Wait two minutes. 
[01:08:00]  We'll say something  really dumb.  Let's bring in  the incest couch.  We're back with  the O.B.  and Anthony show  with Ozzy Osbourne News.  Look at that coincidence.  Can you believe this?  Poor Ozzy.  Ozzy breaks leg.  Postpones dates.  Despite what legions  of metal followers  would have you believe,  Ozzy Osbourne  is apparently mortal  after all.  The heavy music pioneer  has suffered a stress fracture 
[01:08:30]  and will have to  reschedule 10 dates  on his Merry Mayhem tour,  according to a statement  released Friday.  Ozzy injured his leg  when he slipped,  stepping out of the shower  before last week's  Merry Mayhem  stop in Arizona.  The metal kingpin  then proceeded to tour  on the broken leg  for a week  before seeing a doctor  on Thursday  and being ordered  to rest.  You don't want to hear  that Ozzy slipped  in the shower.  I was going to 
[01:09:00]  in the shower  and I was growing  up and so  I saw my condition  and I saw  fall on the floor.  And I was like  a little pain  in my leg.  But I was doing  like my training  and being torn  and playing  the wrong role.  I was having  my life alert.  I was falling  and I can't get up. 
[01:09:30]  And they called  my family  and my work.  Wait,  do you have  a life alert?  Well,  I'm not a kid  anymore.  You know,  suddenly a lady  in the shower  and said,  I was falling  and I can't get up.  So I hit  a little butt  and they called  my family  and the doctor.  Yeah.  And they come  up and say,  Ozzy,  what have I?  But I was  felled out  in the shower.  Awful.  And he's  going to keep  torn.  But the doctor  told me  I broke  my leg.  It must be 
[01:10:00]  hard to get  in and out  of your helicopter  with a stress  fracture in your leg.  My legs,  I'm having chest  pains.  As you said,  people,  it's life alert.  My son,  Michael,  get me.  But you weren't  having chest  pains,  right?  Because you're  going to freak  out.  No,  I didn't realize  it was,  you know,  chest pains  is nothing.  It's a little  gasp.  As you make  loads,  I need a doctor  for a fresh  liver.  I couldn't get  into my  helicopter.  My bones 
[01:10:30]  is a little  brittle.  I don't  enjoy your  kids' bones.  Just a little,  you know,  it's going  to bump  the chairs  that are  slipping  on the floor.  It's going  to slip  and they  go crack.  They've got  my leg.  But thank  God for  life call  that my  son,  Michael,  gave me.  So you  have the  life call.  My life  call pending.  And what,  you slipped  on a bar  of soap  or you  were bending  down to get  the soap?  We got  there.  Ozzy was  in tremendous  pain.  But thank  God. 
[01:11:00]  That was  it very  much.  Now I'm a  little rascal  on me  little rascal.  I just  drive around  in a little  rascal  scooter.  But I'm just  a normal  rock star.  I'll do  things more  he loves  me.  Things  I'm  special.  But  I just  need a  special  handicap  ramp  up  through  my  helicopter.  pop. 
[01:11:30]  Ozzy needs  a ramp  on the  stage.  It looks  ridiculous.  It's a  crazy train  and now  he's  incorporating  the show.  It's a  crazy train  and I'll  come out  and pull  in a big  train  on my  little  rascal.  It's  wonderful.  Look.  Get out  of the way.  Here comes  Ozzy.  Broken  leg.  Thank you 
[01:12:00]  Ozzy.  That's an  exclusive  Anthony.  It's an  exclusive  from Ozzy.  He fell  down the  shower.  He had  the life  call and  he called  his family  and everything's  okay.  My left  phone pendant  that my son  Michael has.  I love that  one.  She was in  tremendous  pain.  Thanks to  my son  Michael.  TJ,  what's going  on?  Hey,  what's going  on,  guys?  Hey,  man.  I love 
[01:12:30]  osteoporosis  Ozzy,  man.  I can't  wait until  he has  Alzheimer's.  Ozzy's  osteoporosis.  The osmosis.  Oh,  my God.  Look at  Frank.  Wait a minute.  Ozzy slipped  in the shower.  Didn't Doc  Brown do  that?  Where do  the connections  end?  Everybody  slips,  bumps his  head and  invents  the  flux  capacity.  Anthony,  our favorite  mom is  checking in.  Yes.  This would  be Little  League mom,  Marianne.  What's up,  Marianne?  Hey,  guys.  How you  doing?  You are  quite the  goer.  I got 
[01:13:00]  your email  before the  show today,  and man,  was that a  turn-on.  Thank you  for that.  Oh,  you're  welcome.  Nice little  turn-on  before the  show as  she explained  how hot  that lesbian  scene was  Friday in  the studio.  Yeah.  And that  she was  giving  oral.  Well,  you could  say that.  Giving  oral for the  No.  You  hadn't?  No.  I was  naked on  your lesbian  couch.  Well,  I wasn't  even naked.  I was  in my  bra and  underwear on  your lesbian  couch.  I'll tell you  something.  You knew  what you  were doing  from the 
[01:13:30]  look on  that girl's  face.  Oh,  yeah?  I'll tell  you that.  Oh,  yeah.  You know  what was  really hot?  They were  off by  themselves a  little bit  over to  the side  as the  daisy chain  of chicks  was going  off a  couple of  feet away  from them.  And this  girl,  Marianne,  was all  I curled  up.  And you  couldn't  really see  her head  because her  hair was  covering it  and what  she was  doing exactly.  But the  way she  was all  curled up  but completely  naked,  it was so  hot to  watch.  Oh, 
[01:14:00]  it was  fun to  do.  Yeah,  and her  hair was  all over  the other  girl's belly.  Well,  I guess  you know.  Yeah,  I tend to  think it's  a lot of  fun myself.  Well,  I don't  even think  I shared  this email  with the  crew here.  Marianne was  writing in  talking about  her fun  time on  Friday's  show,  Anthony,  when we  just  completely  lost our  effing minds.  All the  video and  pictures are  up on  foundrymusic.com,  but that  will not  last.  Trust me  on that  one.  As soon  as the  bosses get  back to  town,  that will  be gone.  So make  sure you  get there 
[01:14:30]  in the  next couple  hours.  Anyway,  Marianne writes  that the  craziness with  her and her  husband started  on Friday  night.  The night  before Thursday  night,  right?  Yeah,  we went to  Stilettos on  Thursday night.  Stilettos,  yes,  and what  did you  do?  I don't  know if I  could say  that on  the air.  You can  say it,  just speak  in code.  Opie,  you read  the email.  Did you  think I  could say  that on  the air?  Well,  let's just  put it this  way.  One of the  strippers was  having a lot  of fun with  Marianne's  husband in  front of  Marianne. 
[01:15:00]  Wait a  minute,  are we  talking oral  treats?  No.  No,  they don't  do that there.  I don't  know.  You bring a  girl in,  you don't  know what's  going to happen.  legal,  Anthony.  The knee  job.  They kept  it very  legal.  No, it  was more  than a  knee job.  But the  stripper was  enjoying  Marianne's  husband.  They had  the chairs  bolted to  the wall  there.  All right,  I got you.  So that  was a huge  turn on to  see your  husband getting  off, right? 
[01:15:30]  Oh, yeah,  totally.  And then the  next day,  she comes  running in to  jump into the  lesbian party  we were having.  What did  even invite her?  She just  showed up.  Got completely  naked within  seconds and  jumped into  the action.  Exactly.  And then he  got to see  you get  all turned  on.  Oh, yeah.  What a  marriage you  guys got.  Actually, he  bent down and  was talking to  her when I  was doing  that and  she rubbed  him.  Where was  your little  son there,  the little  leaguer?  What was he  doing while  all this was  going down on  Friday? 
[01:16:00]  Oh, he was  with nanny.  He was with  the nanny.  Not our  nanny.  He was with  his nanny.  With his  nanny.  Yeah.  They were all  dispersed and  you know, it's  so funny because  nobody really,  a couple of  people in town  saw the pictures  from the  MILF contest  because we  didn't tell  anybody about  that.  We were like,  no, no, no.  And then a  couple of  people that  we know said  that they saw  the pictures and  it was like,  okay.  So we figured  it's a six  o'clock hour.  Everybody's  pretty much  home.  So we  haven't had  anybody say,  oh, I heard  you and I  saw you.  And all the 
[01:16:30]  pictures on  the website,  you can't see  my face in  any of them.  Wow.  I told you,  Opie, we  should have  played the  lotto this  weekend.  Yeah.  You know, I  mentioned it on  the air and I  just got to  confirm this.  I was very  close to the  action, checking  it out.  And I  remember one  of the girls  was getting  to your  backside.  Oh.  She was kind  of going to  that area,  let's just say.  And you  whispered  something to  her.  And I do  believe it 
[01:17:00]  had something  to do with  your little  friend.  Exactly.  Oh, yeah,  yeah, that's  right, that's  right.  Some girl  wanted to  reciprocate.  Before I  even came in,  I asked  Stinky for  some scissors,  you know, to  like cut a  string that I  would do,  because I  didn't want to  have a bubble  with that  string.  Cut a  string?  Wow.  So I just  like pretty  much took it  out altogether  and was just  like forbidden  anybody to go  anywhere near  that area.  Yeah, what's  wrong with a  little crime  scene, Zex? 
[01:17:30]  Exactly.  We love the  little league  mom.  Hey, is  your son into  video games?  Yes, definitely.  We have an  Xbox up for  grabs.  Is he asking  for an Xbox  this holiday  season?  There's more  than one of  them.  They're always  asking.  I'm not  partial when  it looks like  a sucking  chest horn.  Are you?  No.  Why not?  Why not?  Go for it.  I like when a  medic has to  come running  over and pour  that powder on  it.  Hot compresses  and...  Medic! 
[01:18:00]  Medic!  Anthony, you're  into crime  scene sex?  I love the  crime scene  sex.  I don't care.  My brother  thinks crime  scene sex is  the best.  I don't care if  that looks like  Nicole's walkway.  We've been  married for  almost 12 years  and it's like,  you know, you  can't stop at  that time.  You know, so it's  like not really a  big deal.  And there's always  other places to  go if you have a  mind to.  Medic!  Rampart!  Rampart!  He's losing  blood!  Believe me, I 
[01:18:30]  don't care.  I could care  less.  Yeah, he doesn't  care much either.  Man, you guys  are just wild.  How many years  have you been  married?  Almost 12.  And how many  times a week  do you do it?  Five.  I don't care  when I take it  out and it  looks like Al  Capone's  baseball bat.  Doesn't bother  me.  Married 12 years  doing it five  times a week.  Five times a  week.  God bless you  too. 
[01:19:00]  God did bless  us too.  I will speak  for every guy  out there.  That's a rarity,  my friends.  Yeah, I think  so.  I know people  getting it once  a week or, you  know, four times  a month or  something like  that, but I  don't think my  husband could  deal with that.  All right,  Little League  Mom, here's the  deal.  We got Xboxes  to give away.  Okay.  We got two of  them.  One, we're  definitely doing  cherry darts for  the Xbox.  That's happening  on Thursday.  We're going to  have to get the  contestants very  soon.  But we have  another Xbox we're  going to give  away to a  mommy.  Okay.  And the contest 
[01:19:30]  is called Mommy,  What Would You  Do to Your Box  for an Xbox?  Okay.  So if you could  figure out something  to do, I think you  could start the  contest.  Okay, well, you  saw a lot of it.  Like, what else  could you do besides  shaving it or  piercing it?  That's just it.  You know?  Well, you got to  get creative there,  Little League Mom.  It's up to you.  I'm just going to  throw this out  there.  You know, hang up  and think about it  and call us back.  But basically, it's  called Mommy, What  Would You Do to  Your Box for an  Xbox?  But it's got to be 
[01:20:00]  something creative.  Yeah.  You know, shaving.  Eh, fine.  I never shaved  before.  Well, eh.  Just because it's  red.  I don't think you're  supposed to shave  a red box.  All right, look,  you're not dealing  with a pussy show  here.  All right, the last  time we did, you  know, faggy.  Right.  The last time we did  something similar to  this, let's just put  it this way, a lady, a  mom, uh, shot a  bottle rocket.  That's all we need  to say.  Shot a bottle rocket.  Now, that's something  that would be huge.  Everyone could figure  out the rest of that.  Yeah.  But she shot a 
[01:20:30]  bottle rocket.  Yep.  So we need the  mommies to get  creative out there.  Something creative  like that.  You want to make  something out of it.  You want to dress it  up.  You want to go for  some kind of a  capacity contest.  I don't know.  You know, whatever,  whatever you ladies  decide on.  If you think it's  enough to win that  Xbox, give it a  whirl.  Okay.  All right.  I will definitely  think about it.  And by the way, I  told you, Opie, that  like we have a date  in two weeks, not  you and I.  Oh, well, I'm not  going to say Opie.  No, not you and 
[01:21:00]  I.  With one of the  girls that was in  here, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Totally.  So good luck with  that.  Let us know how  that goes for you.  Okay.  If I can think of  anything, I'll definitely  let you know.  We got an Xbox up for  grabs.  Okay.  Mommy, what would  you do to your box  for an Xbox?  Okay.  All right.  See you.  There she goes.  Little big mom.  Bye-bye.  We love her.  I didn't know her.  She just ran into  the studio and got  naked.  Great security around  here, by the way.  And, well, it's obvious  she wasn't packing any  weapons because she  got naked, but it  was taking, it took  quite a while for the  other girls to, and 
[01:21:30]  they're all groping and  everything, and then  finally one went, who  is this?  She's like, Mel, who  is this?  Yeah.  You're groping her.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And a quick little  clip.  Yeah.  From the time that  that bottle rocket was  shot.  This baby is...  This baby is Claire.  Psycho Mark is  downrange.  Good job, sir.  All right.  Psycho Mark is  downrange.  He is hiding behind  El Duque, the big  giant life-size  cardboard cutout of  El Duque.  We're firing a  bottle rocket at a  blackout.  Isn't that a...  Hey, stop it. 
[01:22:00]  Opie, if you would  please give me the  lighter.  Okay.  Yes.  Clear the range.  Clear the range.  What a great moment in  radio this is.  And fire in the  hole.  Let's go.  Fire in the hole, and  that's never been more  appropriate than it is  right now.  Ready?  Don't move.  Here it goes.  Look out, Rick.  And...  We're lit. 
[01:22:30]  We're lit.  We're lit.  Oh, my God.  And...  Shoot.  Shoot.  Yeah!  I love that one.  There it was, man.  As it happened.  Yeah.  Bottle rocket.  I faded out because I...  I sound like a complete  fool.  She fired a bottle rocket  out of her most  intimate of areas.  Fantastic.  Well, it was a very  exciting time.  We have a go.  I lost my effing mind 
[01:23:00]  because I've never seen  anything like that before  in my life.  Who had seen something  like that before that?  Holy cow!  We want to do that live  on stage at one of our  road shows.  Why not?  We could do that.  Anthony, we've been  talking about the plane  crash in the Rockaways.  Yeah.  And we're going...  I start...  I was going with the  Flock of Seagulls theory.  Uh-huh.  You're going with the  Back to the Future theory  because there's a lot of...  There's a lot of  coincidences going on.  Strange little Back to the 
[01:23:30]  Future references  with this plane crash.  Right.  I hope you've been  following it as the  show goes on here.  Well, Dave wants to add  to the Back to the Future  theory.  Which is...  This one is just too much.  I totally forgot about  this, but I do remember  it's true.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Remember that fireman  or policeman,  wherever he was?  Mike Moran.  Who said Osama Bin Laden  could kiss his  Royal Irish ass  and then told him,  Hey, I'm in Rockaway.  Yeah, hold on.  Let me play the clip.  I'll play the clip.  Hold on. 
[01:24:00]  Before, Dave, you have  something to add.  Hold on.  Let's play that.  Mike Moran in front  of a national TV audience.  In the spirit of the  Irish people,  Osama Bin Laden,  you can kiss my  Royal Irish ass.  And I live in Rockaway.  And this is my face.  Bitch.  He kind of threw out  the challenge there.  Hey, I told him  where he lives.  I called him a bitch.  And regardless of  how this happened  today,  a plane went down  in Rockaway.  About .7 miles 
[01:24:30]  from his house.  A little over  a half a mile.  And all these weird  back to the future  references.  Now, Dave has one  that I completely  forgot about.  When Mike Moran  was making that speech.  Dave?  When he was making  that speech,  there were two  presenters.  One was Giuliani.  Yeah.  And the other one  was Michael J. Fox.  Michael J. Fox  was on stage  with Mike Moran  when he said that.  Do we need any more?  Where's the FBI?  Look into this. 
[01:25:00]  Wow.  Another thing is,  did you notice  that Michael...  Earl from the future  had a vision.  Come on.  Yes, Dave?  I noticed also  that when Michael  was up there,  he was twitching a lot  like he might have  known something.  Oh, no.  Don't get carried away.  That's just his Parkinson's.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, Dave.  So, you know,  I'm sold.  I know there's  some kind of tie-in.  Michael J. Fox  just had another kid, too.  Was that a tie-in?  No.  Oh, okay. 
[01:25:30]  Became a father again.  All right.  Boy, that must be  something for his wife.  What?  Could be a plus.  It's like you're  getting a vibrator  and sex at the same time.  I know this much.  Michael J. Fox  is rocking the kid  to sleep every day.  Oh.  Oh.  Thank you.  Try the VLB here all week.  Dale from Jersey  says in that clip,  Opie sounds like  he just won 100 grand.  Oh, because it's just...  I sound like a complete tool,  but it was just amazing.  Ah, yeah.  I mean, 
[01:26:00]  we had a heat shield set up.  We had...  We had to do this.  We had to put a...  Didn't we have to put a bottle  for protection?  The whole trick was that  it was a bottle rocket,  so the beer bottle  had to be used  as a launch pad.  And the beer bottle  was somewhere,  and then we had  a heat shield,  and it was...  It took us, I think,  over an hour  to set up this whole thing.  Yeah, because we couldn't  let it burn her.  Safety first.  Right.  So we had this  plexiglass shield  with a hole in it  that the stick went through  so it wouldn't burn her. 
[01:26:30]  And when it went...  It went off without a hitch.  Flying down the hall.  It was great.  Flying down the hall.  It was like we were NASA.  We planned it out.  Right.  So...  All right.  So there you have it.  We have two Xboxes  to give away.  One this week  definitely will be given away  as we play Cherry Darts  for the Xbox.  Yeah, that's going to be fun.  And then we're going to  give the mommy some time  to figure it out,  but then we have another  Xbox for the contest.  Mommy, what would you do  to your box for an Xbox?  Yeah.  Okay? 
[01:27:00]  Right.  You're listening to the antics  of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, there you can sound the music.  Here we are at WNEW FM 102.7.  Set atop a presidential penthouse  overlooking the skyline of Manhattan.  Made by the sweat and labor  of peasants from across the world.  All making tons of money here  in the business called  ANSETAINMENT. 
[01:27:30]  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  You're checking out  the Opie and Anthony show today.  Yo.  Yo, yo, yo.  A couple of phone numbers  in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  866-2774.  Wow.  Look who stopped by  to say hi, Anthony.  Paul Mercurio.  But it's not only  Paul Mercurio anymore.  It's the award winning.  No.  It is not only  just the award winning. 
[01:28:00]  It is Emmy award winning  Paul Mercurio.  Paul Mercurio  from The Daily Show  on Comedy Central.  We have an Emmy award winner here.  You know what that means?  What the hell?  What?  Classy.  He's going to go the way  of Jon Stewart.  Yeah.  Probably his last appearance  on our show.  Remember, Jon used to be  on this show.  Jon used to be on here  all the time.  I didn't know that.  Jon used to come on  this show.  Oh, right.  He mentioned he hates you guys.  Right.  Yeah.  In between gigs,  he'd come on.  And then he gets the,  you know,  the good gig at Comedy Central.  He forgot all about 
[01:28:30]  his pals opening.  See, the difference is  you're syndicated.  I wouldn't do that now.  Yeah.  He even came on our show  when we weren't syndicated.  Yep.  Did he really?  That's how low  he was in his career.  Wow.  It was right before  he got on The Daily Show.  And even,  I guess it was in  Cindy Adams' column  the other day,  she was talking about  he's becoming a little snooty.  Doesn't return her phone calls.  And she said,  hey, Jon,  better get a hold of yourself  until the old bat  is yelling at him. 
[01:29:00]  You know?  Don't be forgetting  what got you  where you are.  Well, you know  your career's  on the precipice  when you get  Cindy Adams mad  and you forget.  Yeah.  She has,  within a four-block  area of New York,  she has an incredible  amount of power.  Of course she does.  The four  very strong blocks.  So I don't have  the award yet.  We will get it.  I want to see it.  I'm going to bring it in  and we'll drink from it  like it's the Stanley Cup.  Oh, I would rock.  Drink from that.  But isn't it that  Globe thing?  That's the one.  You can't drink  out of an Emmy Award.  Well, we'll stick a cup  in the top. 
[01:29:30]  That's not the shame.  I'll put a helmet.  Well, that's a good idea.  I'm sorry.  I didn't win the Stanley Cup.  I can't skate.  I have an Emmy.  I drank out of the Stanley Cup,  my friend.  Did you really?  Swear to God.  Growing up on Long Island,  Clark Gillies,  when he won it,  he brought it to  the Huntington Crescent Club  for the day  and we all got to drink  from the Stanley Cup.  I will never forget that day.  Did you have to service him?  They had it on display all day.  Is it really heavy?  It's huge  and it looks like crap  close up.  It's all dented.  But that's the very cool thing  about hockey  is it's a people's sport. 
[01:30:00]  They do that, you know?  I'm going to do it with Miami,  just people on the street.  I'm just going to go up to them.  Emmy!  Drink from it!  I would just walk around with it.  Like, walk down the street  because people would look  and go,  he's holding an Emmy.  Like, why not?  Put it on a chain  around my neck.  That's what I'm going to do.  This is my,  oh, have you seen my Emmy?  Have you seen my bling bling?  Yeah, look at my bling bling.  It's unlike anyone else's bling bling.  We couldn't,  nobody went to the ceremony.  We stayed here in New York.  I went for the second time.  I think other things  were happening in the city.  Yeah, it's not all about you. 
[01:30:30]  What was it?  What was something pressing  in the city  that kept the Emmys from going,  hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.  I don't know.  Hmm, hmm, hmm.  It's all about  World Trade Center  and people dying.  How often am I going to get  nominated for an Emmy  and win?  Exactly.  That's, that,  seriously, though,  the thought,  I talked to Louis Black  about this,  the thought for a split second.  Oh, Louis,  remember him?  Because he went through,  oh, is he,  has he dumped you guys too?  I don't know.  He's getting there.  You know what?  He has not called me,  and if you're listening,  Louis,  you have not called me  to congratulate me 
[01:31:00]  on the Emmy.  Oh, my God.  What kind of a friend  is that?  None.  I got to listen to his  Jewish-oriented stories  that I could care less about.  I have a pile of,  no,  what,  I had,  you know how many  swatches of  club,  club,  fabric I had to look at  for your damn couch,  you loser call?  And he doesn't call you?  He didn't call.  That's horrible.  So, yeah,  Louis Black.  I remember him.  Yeah,  another one that's  falling to the wayside.  All of a sudden, you know,  Hollywood's calling about  maybe a sitcom,  and,  you know,  when you can't get  arrested anymore,  remember who got you 
[01:31:30]  arrested?  We did.  We did.  We thought we bonded  with the guy, yeah.  So I was in,  we were in New York  for it,  because the second time  I went out there,  and then I got canceled  because of the war.  What is this whole thing  with death and award shows?  Why don't they go together?  For some reason,  you can't have an award show  when there's too much  death going on.  You can pick a spot  between acts that make death,  and if you plan it right  and land in the middle,  then it's fine,  but not too close  to the death.  Yeah,  and you know they had  a board up that had  like a death card 
[01:32:00]  that they moved around,  you know?  Yeah, yeah.  A big death card  in the programming room  where they have that big board  with the time slot  and the different shows,  and it's just a big red card  with death written on it.  And someone's like,  no, that's not going to work.  We got death on that.  We got death here.  We can't back you up  with the death.  That's not good for me.  Death as a lead-in.  Checking his Blackberry  Les Moonves now.  No, I got, yeah,  now we're going to have  to move that.  We have death for three days.  Oh, we have, yeah,  Anthrax is starting that week.  Ooh, that's not going to be good.  Not good, not good.  No, no, no.  It's this plane.  I've fallen out of the sky.  I know it's terror-related. 
[01:32:30]  I can't, I don't need that.  You know it's terror-related.  Oh, how do you know?  Well, I stubbed my toe  and I think there's  a conspiracy going on.  I can't function anymore.  I'm on the highest alert possible.  Paul, they told us to be.  If my alertness gets any higher,  I'd be gay.  And I don't even know  what that means.  There's two theories  going on, though.  I'm going with  the flock of seagulls theory.  Which is?  He's going with  a flock of seagulls.  A lot of birds  sucked into the engine.  Boom.  By the way,  Dominicans,  like these people,  another excuse to eat.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Now they're all upset  and they're going to deal  with their emotions for food. 
[01:33:00]  I'm thinking a lot of...  Paul Mercurio said that.  Call in and...  Emmy Award winner.  Yeah, exactly.  They need more reason  to be emotional.  Wow, send that to the Emmys.  They need more reason  to be emotional.  Wow.  And then Anthony's going  with the Back to the Future theory.  I got the Back to the Future theory.  It's just taking off now.  Well, how did...  I heard...  Well, I found out...  Someone wants to know  if you got a golden megaphone,  by the way.  Ha-ha!  See, I wasn't even  pulling that out.  Go ahead, go ahead. 
[01:33:30]  Anthony from West Orange  wants to know  if Paul got a golden megaphone.  I got it for writing,  by the way,  not for...  Go ahead.  Not for warming up.  Ladies and gentlemen,  usually this man  doesn't have an announcer.  He's the guy  that comes out  and warms up the show,  but he decided  he now needs somebody  to announce him.  So with no further ado,  when Paul comes out  to warm up the crowd  for John,  Paul works off  of your energy.  He is now  Emmy Award winning  Paul Mercurio.  So if you could please, 
[01:34:00]  when Paul comes out  to warm up the crowd  for John,  he will work off  your energy  that will in turn  he will be asking  for your energy  for John,  but remember,  he's the Emmy Award winner,  not John.  No, John won one too.  What did he win for?  He won for writing.  He's one of the writers.  Oh, yeah,  but he didn't want  to win for writer.  He wanted to win  for best show.  We were up for best show  and best writing.  Who got the best show?  This new startup,  Letterman?  Never heard of him.  Did Letterman win?  Letterman deserves that.  That's because he cried. 
[01:34:30]  He cried better  than John cried  during the disaster.  Did you guys get anything  for the national?  I saw this national radio  broadcast in 2001.  Yes, we did.  Were you up for anything?  We did.  We got S'd on  is what we got.  Were you nominated?  We went from  the best to the worst  in one year.  Yeah.  I don't know how that happened.  What do you mean?  We won last year.  Yeah.  We did win.  The one that they had  on ABC?  Yeah, yeah.  We won last year.  What is the award?  Oh, my God.  It's at my house.  Which award is it?  That's the big old radio  in the shape of an award.  Was that it?  That was two years ago. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, no, that's the  honor.  Because I never got custody  of mine.  Oh, no.  I think mine got burnt  in the fireplace.  Just a nice wall plaque thing.  Right, the wall plaque thing.  Yeah, we won.  Well, you should bring yours  in when I bring my Emmy in  and we'll beat the crap out of you.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure.  Like, on the street  we would be going,  I know what that is,  but what's the plaque  that you're holding?  It's an Emmy for God's sake.  The only thing that tops that  is an Oscar.  And unlike your award,  it didn't even beat  the Golden Globe.  And unlike your award,  we could do something  off our award.  We could, you know,  put some lines.  Like, you know, Coke.  Do you laugh  at People's Choice winners? 
[01:35:30]  People's Choice Award?  That's really a stupid award, right?  I can't even make eye contact.  Isn't it?  It's like,  I don't want to be  in the same room  as the People's Choice  award winner.  I want a goddamn Emmy  or an MTV award.  I'll tell you what,  I have a lot of respect  for Ace Award winners.  The Ace Award.  Do they even still have that  for Cable Excellence?  It was a plexiglass ace.  Yeah, it was the spade, actually.  It was the spade, right.  The spade.  Hey, hey, no racist puns there.  Let's stay on the Dominicans.  Let's stay focused.  Right.  What are you saying?  Well, it was going  to the Dominican Republic. 
[01:36:00]  I understand where it was going.  I know, I'm being mean.  Could have been vacationers.  Yes.  That's true.  Not anymore.  No.  No, the one jet engine  is in the front of a gas station.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it's appropriate.  The guy's going to have  a lot of work on his hands.  That would be...  He walks out.  Listen, I got tires to change.  I got two brake jobs.  This is going to...  Three weeks at the best.  Why is he an American accent?  I don't...  Don't do it.  I got to move this.  We were talking about  how the news stations  love this  and they're praying 
[01:36:30]  that this is another  terrorist attack.  Oh, absolutely.  Because they love  the ratings they're getting  out of all this stuff.  And Smitty's got something  about that on the line.  Smitty, what's up?  Yeah, I just walked in the house  and I turned the TV on.  The first thing the guy  is saying,  we were among the first ones  on the scene.  I was thinking of Anthony  at the beginning of the show.  Yeah.  They do.  They say now their whole thing  will be first on the scene.  You know who else  is first on the scene?  If you ever look at  some of those  Discovery channels,  Serengeti things,  first on the scene?  Vultures.  The vultures 
[01:37:00]  are always the first  on the scene  of the carcass.  Yeah, and the guy  looked all hairy, too,  just like you were saying.  Oh, the guy didn't get...  Usually they care  about their live shots,  how they look.  Okay, am I going to  make up all the...  This guy ran.  I swear to God,  he lunged into the frame  just to make sure  that he was first  on the scene.  I'm convinced  at this point, though,  these reporters  make sure they look  all disheveled and messy.  Yeah, they have to look  messy.  First, they put the tan jacket on.  Nick, this is such a big story.  Nick Robertson  from CNN  flew from Afghanistan 
[01:37:30]  and is on the scene.  But really?  Yeah, the guy  that was usually  an Afghanistan fan.  You're right.  It justifies Fox.  You know,  we'll report,  you decide.  Come on.  Yeah.  You know something?  Before September 11th,  a lot of these...  The stories you're reading  that were the news agencies,  CNN, Fox,  and whatnot,  were dying.  They were dying  because there wasn't any story.  They were on Condit  for months.  Oh, I know.  That's all there was.  So they are milking  anything  that comes about.  Remember the good old days  when we worried 
[01:38:00]  about school shootings  and a woman driving  her five kids  in the bathtub?  Those were good old days.  And then shark attacks.  Who could forget  the sharks ripping off  young boys' arms?  The sharks said,  hey,  these people got enough  to deal with  and swam away  and dined on fish  like they are supposed to.  For some reason,  I haven't heard  of one shark attack  since September 11th.  The only way I worry  about a shark now  is if I see him  mailing a letter  at the postal office.  Hey,  what's he up to?  What's he up to?  Come on,  he's in a postal uniform.  With that fin. 
[01:38:30]  I see his fin.  That's danger.  Look at the guys  we're relying on.  Some guy  in a bad beard.  This Northern Alliance.  The Northern Alliance.  Oh,  we've talked about  the Northern Alliance.  They're making headway.  You know,  I watch the bombings.  I love when we fly over  and bomb this country.  It's a treat for me.  And then I watch  that we're helping  the Northern Alliance  move in,  and I saw them  on horses.  Yeah,  he's loading a turnip  into a grenade launcher.  It's potato gum.  No,  not the turnip.  All these people  mean business this time. 
[01:39:00]  Potato,  one thing,  turnip.  We are a DEFCON turnip.  We've cleared the way  and they are on horseback.  Super soakers.  Yeah,  do you want us  to do everything for you?  Seriously,  I'm serious.  If you watch  Charlie Rose,  they showed footage  of a Northern Alliance member  with a rubber band  and a paper clip.  Oh,  that hurts.  That stings.  Now,  don't even start.  That stings.  You're going crazy over there.  Oh,  I give.  Was the setup  long enough for that?  I give.  Hey,  I wasn't going to question it. 
[01:39:30]  Wow.  You're the Emmy Award winner.  Yeah.  Hey,  you know,  we should talk about  Sylvester Stallone.  This guy's career  is hurting so bad.  He goes,  I got an idea.  Yeah.  Rambo versus Osama.  Now,  he's going to go  with Rambo,  what would that be?  Four?  It's Rambo four.  It would be Rambo four.  Right.  Because Rambo three  was,  oh yeah,  him in Afghanistan.  Fighting the Russians.  Fighting the goddamn  Russian commies.  He goes behind the line 
[01:40:00]  to save a buddy,  an old army buddy of his.  right.  He was actually,  Rambo three,  in Afghanistan,  fighting with  probably the Taliban.  Some of the people  we are fighting now.  It was.  It absolutely was.  He was fighting the Russians.  Right.  And,  maybe officially  not the Taliban,  but.  I bet you in this Rambo four,  he's going to be  intellectually conflicted.  You know,  that would make  an interesting  Emmy award winning story.  On a very special  daily show.  But,  you know,  he might be just a tad 
[01:40:30]  too old now  for the character.  The last one was,  you know,  the commies  were still in business.  I tell you,  I can't believe  he's not doing stuff.  But my mother  will shoot  the apology.  Stop,  or my mom  will shoot too.  I do that  because the first one  left so many  unanswered questions.  Well,  I think he's going to  I'm an Oscar award winner.  You're going to get  deep inside this character  of Rambo.  Introspective  in this.  Well,  he should incorporate  some of his personal life  in what we've heard  about his personal life  from some books  that are out there. 
[01:41:00]  We have some audio,  Paul.  All right.  We do.  We learned that  Sylvester Stallone  likes to get under  glass tables.  Oh,  he's got the  Danny Thomas  fetish.  Danny Thomas  had this fetish.  Danny Thomas  had it too?  Yeah.  Swear to God,  Marla Thomas,  eat your hot out.  It's not bad enough  you're living  with Phil Donahue.  Live with that!  Danny Thomas.  Danny Thomas.  Because I know,  we used to do jokes  on it.  We interviewed  these hookers.  About three or four  of them got together  and wrote a book.  The book was excellent.  Talking all sorts  of dirt about celebrities. 
[01:41:30]  Wait a minute.  You're trying to convince  me four hookers  wrote a book?  Let's back up a minute.  Ghostwriters.  Yeah, of course.  And then I took this  into my mouth.  What's the question mark?  And then I put that there.  Funny how a banana  and an exclamation point  look exactly the same.  But they were talking  about all the celebrities  in Hollywood.  And he's into it.  And none of them sued.  Yeah.  Yeah.  None of them filed sued.  Because they had dates  and times and all sorts of stuff.  Yeah.  And one of them was  Sylvester Stallone liked  to get under a glass table 
[01:42:00]  and the hookers  would get above  and do.  And do.  And do.  He was doing research  for a role as a proctologist.  Maybe that was it.  But you know something?  Maybe if you're that rich  and you're bored one night.  I won't fencer off.  Are you kidding me?  Maybe a bored one night.  What do you guys do now?  You're worth $30 million.  What do you do?  At least.  Stop it.  Yeah, look at us.  Of course we do.  But you know,  you're rich  and then you got one of those.  You remember when you were  alone in the house  and you were a kid  and you'd go to town  on the pillow 
[01:42:30]  or something  with some Vaseline, right?  I don't know  what you're talking about,  Paul, don't you?  You were in the house  with me.  Imagine being rich  and able to get  anything you want.  Maybe one day  you just have a hankering  for sitting under a table  while a hooker  takes a dump.  How do you come upon that?  How do you stumble  upon that activity?  What do you reach down to?  What do you think  of what I've done already?  I bag supermodels.  I've done that.  I get any chick I want.  I've had him  diddle places 
[01:43:00]  I don't like  talking about in public.  You know,  I've never seen  one take a dump.  Hey, give me the phone,  Mickey.  Mickey's still here.  Give me the phone,  Mickey.  Call the hooker up.  Have a grab  on the table, Mickey!  You hear the story  where he was still  mic'd for something  and he went into his trailer  and he was with  one of the actresses  and do you ever hear  this line?  I don't know  if I can say this line.  Uh-oh.  Just kind of touch it up 
[01:43:30]  for radio.  I'm not good at touching up.  Use the alphabet.  If you were talking  about a mechanic,  you know,  it might have been able  to be used.  It's like an aluminum shaft  that the air goes through.  Right, right.  Oh, the air shaft.  Stroke the, uh,  all right.  Stroke the, uh,  stroke the S.  He goes,  stroke the S.  Yeah.  Cradle the B.  Oh, oh, cradle the,  yeah.  Stroke the junk.  Cradle the yam bag.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  We do it over  and over again.  Stroke it.  You're cradled. 
[01:44:00]  Cradled and stroke.  Now stroke and cradle.  He's working on the script.  Pauly, Pauly.  Cradle.  Cradle and stroke.  All right, Biggie.  Biggie, get it.  All right, now cradle,  stroke and cradle.  Adrian.  Adrian, cradle and stroke.  Cradle and stroke.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Now you get it.  Now.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:44:30]  Rubbing the tug.  Rubbing the tug.  Hey, Tom,  you're next on the  Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, hi.  Hey, man.  Uh, Rambo.  Yeah, I remember Rambo 3.  Rambo 3?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  It really kind of like  his timing sucked.  Like, like a week  after the movie came out  before the Russians  left out  and Rachel was  hugging the Russians.  What?  I have no,  I have, sir,  I have no idea  what you're talking about.  Tom, are you?  You have totally stumped me. 
[01:45:00]  Are you trying to say  Rambo 3 came out  a week before  Reagan tore down the wall?  Correct.  It was a useless movie  by the time it showed up.  It was useless  way before that.  Well, yeah,  so his time is,  by the time he makes them,  maybe it's the best thing  to make a movie now  that it's all going to be dead.  All right, hey.  Thanks, Tom.  I think he's doing it  so his brother Frank Stallone  can get work.  Rambo 3 was 1988,  so now he wants  to be Rambo again.  You know,  this is, 
[01:45:30]  yeah,  that's an important  13 years.  And I'd hate to even see  what Richard Crennell  looks like now.  Oh, my God.  Johnny!  Johnny,  what are you doing?  I hear there's  a seminal scene  where he changes  his catheter bag for him.  Please help me.  I've lost all use  of my bowels.  And now I need Rambo  to come in  and dity me.  All right.  Colonel Troutman!  Colonel Troutman,  I'm going in! 
[01:46:00]  It's worse than the commies!  I like the 60.  Nice.  Rambo 4,  so he would be fighting  the story has it  that he's going to go  in now into Afghanistan  and try to get  Osama bin Laden  and the Al-Qaeda network.  It'll work.  Oh, sure.  The Taliban will see him.  They'll see Rambo.  Yeah.  They think they've been  transported back to 1982  when they didn't exist  and they won't know  what to do.  They'll be frozen 
[01:46:30]  in a track.  Wait, wait.  We do not exist.  This does not make sense.  I decided this.  You decided this.  You drew first mud.  Crab joke.  Use your first mud.  Crab joke.  I'm going to take  all the people  from the Al-Qaeda network.  Put them under  the giant glass tables  and grab them!  Ah!  Ah!  There you go, Osama! 
[01:47:00]  Do your dressing!  Do your dressing!  Very good.  Very nice.  Adrian,  you've got to  help me out here, Adrian.  I don't know  if I could do this.  You know,  he always gets that  point where he doesn't  know if he could do it.  No, the legs.  The legs.  I don't know.  I've got to stay strong.  He says,  I don't know if I'd look  good in a thong anymore.  Was Rambo ever  in a thong? 
[01:47:30]  He doesn't say thong.  Yes, he did!  He says, quote,  I don't know if I'd look  good in a thong anymore.  In my fantasies,  I'd love to do one more.  What kind of a...  That's the best fantasy  you can come up with?  He's crazy.  You're self in a thong.  Oh!  You're insane.  Jesus.  Rick cracks himself up.  Yeah, look.  I'm looking at the  Internet Movie Database,  Rambo 3,  and a bunch of them  Arab names in there. 
[01:48:00]  Mohammed.  The Mayrabs.  And he's Saeed Al-Dain.  And now he'll be  fighting on the other side.  I say don't do it there.  I say don't try it there, Rambo.  He says that he's  at home in Miami  working on the script.  Working on the script.  You know what he's doing?  At working,  he's getting a tan.  Right.  I'm going to hire  Emmy Award winning 
[01:48:30]  Paul Mercurio  to help me out  with the script.  That is what...  So, Paul,  what do I do?  Did I find I'm a...  Or do I hit him  with a big safety?  Ah!  I need a drop  for his butt!  Oh, my God.  His 13-year-old son  is going to write  as soon as he's tired  of hanging out  with his friends.  Rambo's Vietnam  commanding officer,  Colonel Troutman,  is held hostage  in Afghanistan  and it's up to Rambo  to rescue him.  That's the thing.  There you go.  That was a tree.  Who do you think  is going to play 
[01:49:00]  Osama bin Laden?  My money's on  Jamie Farr.  Jamie Farr.  Well, you're very good  in those parts.  Sure, you put the beard  on him.  I think the America Cinema  has been waiting  for that final showdown scene  between Stallone  and Jamie Farr.  Much like Pacino  and De Niro  and Heat,  right.  They were waiting.  Everybody was waiting  for that moment.  Hey, Paul,  I'm going to give you  a part in the movie.  Okay.  Hi, Taliban.  Yeah, Rambo's  going to be coming out  real soon.  He's going to kill you.  What we need 
[01:49:30]  is your energy.  We need you to fight back  so he looks cool.  And remember,  you all have to die  before he gets  to Bin Laden,  okay?  I'll see if you can  remember that.  If you have any  cell phones or beepers,  turn them off now.  It distracts Rambo  when he's using  the 60s.  See, we're still  your friends, Paul.  I know.  You don't let anything  go to my head.  You think we're going  to show your respect?  Absolutely not.  I'm the award winner now.  Absolutely not. 
[01:50:00]  Billy, you got something  to add to this mess?  Yeah.  How you doing, boys?  All right.  I don't know how true it is.  A friend of mine  ended up moving to Hawaii.  Yeah.  Got a job at a hotel  or something.  I guess Sly was staying there.  Let's see how I can put this.  He defecated in the shower  and I guess while he was  cleaning or bathing  or whatever you want to call it.  Maybe he was defecated.  He cleaned it up and so now  that you guys are talking  about the glass table  and all that,  it kind of rings true.  I mean, I didn't believe 
[01:50:30]  it at first,  but now there's more stories  of that crap,  I guess you're...  Well...  Maybe it's true.  Yeah, I got to find  the name of this book,  but it was in that book  that he's really into girls  on top of a glass table.  Yeah.  As he's under the glass table.  That's nice.  I hear he likes to dump  on Ritz crackers, too.  Just small amounts.  Everything's better  when he sits on a Ritz.  I said sits,  shoulda.  So we have that  to look forward to.  Yeah, we should take a break.  We got to talk about 
[01:51:00]  the Pope next, too, Anthony.  Yeah.  Boy, that Pope is right with it,  isn't he?  We have the most  with it Pope ever.  He's discovered  this new thing.  What the hell is it called?  Not Shaking?  Uh...  No.  No, not that.  Not Shaking.  Jesus.  With the Pope cane  and everything.  Oh, my God.  He's discovered  the Internet.  Oh, yeah,  that brand new  fangled infernal  machine, the computer.  He only saw the word  because it was written  on the ground. 
[01:51:30]  He holds that pole  and bends over.  It looks very nice  like he's praying  and stuff,  but he doesn't know  his back hurts.  Oh, that hump.  He's so old.  I'm a Catholic.  He's not doing anything.  You're Catholic.  Yeah.  He's not doing anything  for me.  I liked when he was  the young Pope  when he was first  Pope-dized  or whatever the hell  that is that they give him.  The only way  you can feel better  about yourself  is to go to Caroline's  tomorrow night  at 7 o'clock.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  I didn't even see it coming.  These comedians  are good whores.  He slipped it  right in there. 
[01:52:00]  All right, listen.  7 o'clock show.  All right, we have  to take a break.  We'll talk about  the Pope necks  and we'll talk more  about the Xboxes  that we have to give away,  Anthony, okay?  Sure.  As we go to break,  more clips  from the old days, Ant.  Ah.  Remember,  it was a simpler time  back then.  I dug up some stuff  at my house  like last week  from some old boxes.  Stuff we've forgotten  all about, Anthony.  Yeah.  Most of the stuff  hasn't seen the light of day  in a very long time.  I got a clip here,  Trip to the Bahamas. 
[01:52:30]  Trip to the Bahamas.  Another lady  calling us  thinking she was  calling another radio station.  This was something  we used to get a lot.  It was called  Prize Pigs.  What they do  is they have  all these radio stations  in their speed dial  and they'd hear a contest  and they'd troll  the stations  and then when they'd  hear a contest  they'd hit the speed dial  a million times  trying to get through.  They're Prize Pigs,  professional prize winners.  So they obviously  would hit the wrong  number sometimes  and they'd get us  instead.  Right.  This one is  very important. 
[01:53:00]  This one,  this lady was a very,  very hardcore fan  of one of those  mixed stations.  Yep.  There's a mixed station  in every city  in America  I believe,  okay?  So she is really  into this station mix.  Yeah.  Thinking she's winning  this trip to Aruba,  to the Bahamas.  Mm-hmm.  We messed with her  to the point  where she will now  be pissed off  at this station mix.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Check it out  as it went there.  Hello,  is the caller there?  Yes.  Hello.  Hi,  what number am I?  You're trying to be 
[01:53:30]  caller 18,  aren't you?  Yes,  I am.  Well,  let me tell you.  Yes?  You're caller 18.  Oh,  my God.  That's right.  Oh,  my God.  You know how long  we've been trying  to get through?  For years,  I bet.  Oh,  yes.  Tell everyone  what you want.  Oh,  trip to Bahamas?  To the Bahamas.  Oh,  my God.  Oh,  my God.  Can you believe it?  Oh,  no.  Oh,  my goodness.  I bet that stupid  heart of yours  is pumping like crazy.  It sure is. 
[01:54:00]  The Bahamas.  What?  Have you ever been  to the Bahamas?  No,  I haven't.  No,  you haven't.  No?  Uh-oh.  Never been out of the country.  You got a passport?  I'll get one.  All right,  you hold on for one second.  Okay,  thank you.  Oh,  my God,  I can't believe it.  Oh,  my God.  Hello,  is the caller there?  Yes,  I am.  Hey,  what's your name,  man?  It's,  uh,  Marshall.  All right,  Marshall,  this is the management  of the radio station.  Yes. 
[01:54:30]  Marshall,  we just checked our records.  You were actually  the 19th caller.  So,  now you're telling me  I don't have it?  Yeah,  can we maybe,  uh,  send you a bumper sticker?  No,  I don't want a bumper sticker.  How about a t-shirt?  Scrape up a t-shirt  and a hat for you.  No,  no thanks.  You want a CD  of one of your favorite  Mix 98.5 songs?  No,  I really don't want anything.  Thank you.  We do have a Mix  ice scraper.  Yeah,  there is.  That's good  in this weather.  No,  thank you.  I feel bad now.  You're going to be  turned off to our station. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah,  I think so  because my whole company  has been trying  for two years now  to try to win something here.  and they were all excited  that I won.  Well,  I thought I won.  Well,  we have tons of listeners.  We really,  uh,  don't really need you guys  so,  uh,  have a great day.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  O.P.  O.P.  Anthony.  We have our penises.  They do all of our speaking.  They do all the talking for us. 
[01:55:30]  The O.P.  and Anthony Show.  Yeah,  we're back with  The O.P.  and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers  to give out  in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else,  866-277-4WOW.  Also,  really fast,  you gotta get your ass  to foundrymusic.com  and check out the clips  and the pictures  from Friday's  Outrageous Show.  The bosses  are coming back tomorrow  and I don't think  those clips  are gonna stay up there  too long, 
[01:56:00]  okay?  Yeah.  Foundrymusic.com.  You can find the link  off opieandanthony.com.  Speaking of which,  one of the ladies  from,  uh,  the lesbian couch  is calling in right now,  Anthony.  Wanda!  Yeah,  this is Wanda  from rondaclaypin.com,  guys.  So how did you enjoy  the show on Friday?  Ah.  Wait,  which one were you,  Wanda?  I was the one  with Pinky.  Oh, yeah.  You're the one  with the,  uh,  the largest,  um,  I've ever seen  in my life.  Yes, 
[01:56:30]  you know what  I'm talking about.  She's got a big man  in the boat.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I have to say,  I had a thing  for Opie,  he's sexy.  Have you guys  seen that scene  from Shallow How?  Which one?  Where, uh,  Gwyneth Paltrow's  in the front of the boat  and she's really fat.  That would be  the man in the boat.  That's right.  And that's what, uh,  Rhonda has in her, uh,  It's plump.  Slap.  You have a plump one.  Hmm,  we would say yes.  Anyone ever tell you that?  Yeah,  no one's ever told you that?  Oh, I hear it a lot now. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  But I'm not complaining.  It comes in handy.  Well, sure.  And you had a good time Friday.  Oh, I had a great time Friday.  You guys have fun?  We had a great time Friday  ourselves, yes.  Mm-hmm.  Well, you're going to have  to have us back.  I'll give you another big show.  What?  If you're going to have  to have me back,  I'll have another big show  for you.  You've got to top that one.  Hey, Rhonda,  you're boring the crap  out of everyone.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, she did a good enough  job, though.  I guarantee if you were there  on Friday,  you weren't having a boring time  because I think the guy's  mouth was on the floor.  Friday, 
[01:57:30]  Friday you were exciting  the hell out of everybody.  Today you're putting  them to sleep.  Yeah.  Well, I'll tell you what,  I'm sitting here nude.  How about you guys?  Uh, we are too.  We're all nude  sitting around the studios.  Well, you just need me  there, baby.  Thank you, Rhonda.  Yeah, Rhonda.  I'm sitting on top  of a glass coffee table.  You know,  I've got to tell you  something about Rhonda.  Yeah.  Now, she has this  big man in the boat.  Yeah.  It's the size of, like,  one of your,  one of your pinky knuckles.  One of your pinky knuckles. 
[01:58:00]  Really?  Oh, yeah, man.  I think Norton thinks  that's hot.  But he's not here  to defend himself,  but, yeah, that's...  I know she's listening  and I'm going to insult her,  but I have to say it.  I was,  I was talking to her  after the show  and kind of looking  into her eyes.  There's, like,  there's, like,  a slight man  in those eyes.  Wait a minute.  You know,  you're making some  pretty stiff allegations here.  There seems to be just,  and in the voice  we just heard.  Are you saying  that perhaps 
[01:58:30]  the reason  she has such a big man  in the boat  is that  certain organs  of the male and female  are very similar  even though  they're different?  Yeah.  And you say hers  are a little more similar  to the man  than most women's are?  Because it's  a large size  of that  would almost make  like man junk.  Yeah.  Like, it just about...  But did you hear  her voice just now?  Uh, yes.  Well, now we need  an expert.  Is it possible that...  I'm not going to agree  with you  because I might have 
[01:59:00]  to play good cop  when she calls back.  Is it possible  for people to have  90% female  in them  and let's say  just a 10% male?  I don't know  about that.  I'm over to my apartment  and I'll show you.  I don't know about that.  How does that work?  I don't know.  I think unless  you're talking  hermaphrodite.  Maybe she had it  turned inside out.  She was mostly  all woman  but there was  a small part of her  that was...  Maybe it's like 
[01:59:30]  a divining run.  It's just looking  for water.  That could be.  I'm just trying  to bring other  with Miami award  winning capabilities.  Kurt's on the line.  Kurt, what's up?  Man, I wish  this girl would speak up.  She's a guy.  Oh boy.  No, because then  she had female chest.  Of course.  She didn't have  the Adam's apple.  Nice body.  She had...  Yeah, her body  was very nice.  Something's rotten  in Denmark.  She was definitely sexy  but there was  a part of her 
[02:00:00]  that you're like  whoa, wait  there's something else  mixed in here  I'm thinking.  You think so?  Could it be  the hairy knuckles?  I need an expert  to help me with this.  An expert?  What expert  are we going to get?  A doctor or something.  I don't know.  Is it possible?  Yes, but you have  to get it up to  1.6 gigawatts.  Is it possible?  That's all I need  to know today.  Brian, what's up?  Brian?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Oh, nothing.  I was wondering  if any of you guys  saw that  Saving Private Ryan  on ABC last night. 
[02:00:30]  Yes, uncut.  Well, unedited.  They cut it  for commercials.  Can I tell you something?  I was flipping around  and I saw  Saving Private Ryan  was on.  I didn't even bother  watching because  I just assumed  they were going  to cut the crap  out of it.  That's actually  why I tuned in.  And Ann told me  that they let it fly.  Everything.  Yeah, all the S words,  F, anything else  when they're talking  about their junk  and stuff like that.  Yeah, no problem.  I don't know anything  about that.  How do they get  away with that?  Well, when it's  special movies like that  and it's deemed  socially,  I don't know, 
[02:01:00]  like acceptable  artistic merit.  Who are you kidding?  Artistic merit.  Thank you,  Emmy Award winner.  That's exactly  the stuff you write  that makes you win.  But who are you kidding?  It doesn't make  any sense whatsoever.  It doesn't  because if you have  the F word  going out over  ABC's airwaves  there, television,  then you should  be able to have it  regardless of the content.  I think the F word  puts the slaughter  in perspective.  Yeah.  The blood  and the maiming.  Right.  Exactly.  We can show  all that,  all that's fine, 
[02:01:30]  but don't say  the F word.  It might upset  somebody.  Isn't that like  Spielberg's call,  though?  No, it's not  Spielberg's call.  Maybe it's his call  that he says,  I will not have  this edited ever.  That's good,  but they did the  same thing for  Schindler's List.  Is ABC going to  get in trouble  for airing it that way?  That's a pick-me-up  Schindler's List.  No, of course not.  Huh.  Now, yeah,  but you know something?  FCC rules say  that you cannot  say those words  on television.  Is the key  that they put  the disclaimer  up top,  maybe?  Hey, we'll put 
[02:02:00]  a disclaimer on here.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Okay.  Well, maybe I shouldn't  have used the F word  there, Paul.  I'm sorry.  We had a dump  out of me.  And yes,  we're having a fine show.  Okay, well,  that's what I meant  by F-ing.  Yeah, I don't know  what the guideline  is there.  I thought it was  pretty much you have  those words,  you can't say them.  If somebody then  reported ABC to the  FCC, couldn't they  get them in trouble?  Yeah, but you've got  a lot of weird people  out there.  I was at my parents' 
[02:02:30]  house, and my mother  was actually complaining  about the content  on Fox during dinner  because something  went on, King of the  Hill, the kid kicked  his mother in the  crotch or something.  And then she'll sit  through all that  and not say a word  about it.  I think the thing  that broke it open  for everybody was  on Golden Girls,  Rue McClanahan  talking about her  taint.  That opened it up  wide.  And that was a  special episode,  so they were  able to get her.  She had taint  cancer, I believe.  It was great.  And then the old 
[02:03:00]  woman came and said,  well, you got taint  cancer?  Betty White donated  half her taint  so that she would  live.  I'm still getting  teared up just  thinking about it.  I saw it in the  afternoon.  I got to go back  to my theory here,  Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, but I  have to because this  is really bothering  me.  I think Bea Arthur  could probably answer  your question.  She probably answered  that question.  Now, Ned, what's  up?  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  All right.  Guys, I remember  in high school  biology, we talked 
[02:03:30]  about, I learned  that it's possible  for a girl to  have too much  male hormone  and private parts  to actually be  semi-male.  Well, hormones,  sure, they could  pump hormones in  one way, but as  far as X and Y  chromosomes go,  Opie, once they  are determined male  or female, that's  what you get.  This didn't look  like a miniature  guy thing.  It was just a big  female thing.  Right.  But there was  just something a 
[02:04:00]  little different  about her.  Maybe she hangs  Christmas ornaments  from her.  But she was  fair enough.  But I don't want  to make this  perfectly clear  because she's  going to get  insulted.  I mean, she  was...  She's gonna.  She was...  That was seven  minutes ago.  She was woman  enough where if  you had sex with  her, you wouldn't  think you were  gay or anything.  Yeah.  But it just  seemed like 90  to 95 percent  female, 5 to  10 percent male.  And I just want  to know if that's  possible.  The voice sounded  a little husky.  If the voice were  fine, would you 
[02:04:30]  be thinking this  way?  Right.  The voice was  the voice definitely  put it over the  top today.  And the fact she  could bench  press 450.  Yeah.  Would that put it  over the top?  Chris, what's up?  Chris, notice that  we haven't been  using that word.  So don't use that  word.  Everyone understands  what the man in  the boat is.  Right.  All right.  Now continue.  Okay.  I'm a biologist  and there's a  condition known as  testicular feminization.  And one of the  people in Hollywood  who you might know  who has this is  Jamie Lee Curtis.  she has famous 
[02:05:00]  symptoms.  I've heard this  rumor.  This is an urban  legend.  No, no, no.  This is true.  This is true.  Stop it.  I've got to cut  him off because  Rhonda's calling  back in.  This is always  uncomfortable.  This is very  uncomfortable.  Hey, Rhonda.  Hey.  I'm not mad, but  I was going to  say to let y'all  know, I'm all  woman.  I've had a child,  so I don't think  that makes me a  dude.  I don't think  hermaphrodites can  have kids.  Rhonda, Rhonda,  you have...  All I can say is  I'm a maltee,  so I'm glad mine's  large.  Rhonda, you  have the worst  phone. 
[02:05:30]  We can't understand  what you're saying.  You have another  phone in the house?  Yes, hold on.  She said she's a  maltee.  Can you get me  now?  She's holding the  phone with her  big boat.  Yeah, hello,  Rhonda.  Is that on  foundrymusic.com?  We're looking at  a video of your  little man in the  boat.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  All right, look,  Anthony.  Now it looks like...  All right, play it  again.  Play it again.  Now it looks like  a miniature guy thing.  Play it again, Ben.  Can you hear me?  Hold on, Rhonda.  You're going to get a  lot of hits to your 
[02:06:00]  website after we...  Oh, my God.  It's got a...  Oh, you totally have  it, man.  That looks like the...  No, it looks like a  miniature rhinoceros's  head.  You should be working  in the circus.  What are you doing on  the...  Wait a minute.  Wait, hold on.  Look, this is so...  Hold on, Rhonda.  Wait again.  I've got to get...  Rhonda, be quiet for  a second.  I have to get closer  and look at this.  I'm so glad...  Because I am seeing  something.  We're going to get to  the bottom of this.  Yeah.  Dude, look at what  it's got on.  It's got like...  That is a miniature... 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, that's mini junk.  Mini junk.  Rhonda.  Yes.  Like I said, I have a  son, so that means I  have a uterus, so that  means I'm all woman.  You know?  That's what it's like.  I just...  I'm a multi-girl.  Rhonda!  What?  You're going to  frustrate the crap out  of us.  Your phone blows.  And we want to talk  to you about this.  We don't want to be  dicks.  We don't want to like...  You know, we want to  allow you to discuss  this with us, but your  phone sucks.  Well, my phone stinks.  You make a ton of  money on this website.  You can't get a better  phone?  I have a good phone.  Well, that's okay. 
[02:07:00]  Good enough.  As long as we all  talk.  I've been talking  all day with no  problem.  I can't.  She said she's been  talking all day.  No problem.  Maybe this falls in  one of those weird  categories of sound  wave that you can't  hear.  But then she's  talking to other  people.  That made me a  little hot.  Rhonda?  I'm upset.  Oh, there she goes.  No, she's there.  Rhonda, go ahead.  Rhonda, what I saw  in that video, it looks  like if you take a  guy's junk, right?  Yes.  And you divide it up  into its two parts. 
[02:07:30]  Mm-hmm.  There's the one part  of it.  Mm-hmm.  And then at the end  of it is the other  part.  Oh, good, good.  When I look at that  video, I see both parts  on your man in the  boat.  I see a main part.  Mm-hmm.  And I see a tip part.  Mm-hmm.  The part that leads  the way.  Sinky, what do you  think?  Sinky's freaking out.  Sinky, what do you  Sinky?  It's like a little  baby.  It's like a baby junk.  Yeah.  That's a junk. 
[02:08:00]  You know those  collapsible water cuts?  Right, collapsible  water cup junk.  It's like a collapsible  water cup and you  collapsed your junk.  That is.  Rhonda, you've had a  kid, you said?  Yes, I do.  I have a son.  That is so wild.  It's good that you  pierced it to highlight  it.  I pierced it for my own  pleasure.  I didn't pierce it for  love.  Oh, my God.  Wow, that's something.  All right, now I'm  completely confused.  Yeah, I got...  No, I'm not saying  you're...  If you put it up  against a junk, you'll  see that they are  completely two different  things.  Well, I'm not saying  that you're not all  I've never seen a man  in the boat that big 
[02:08:30]  in my life.  You can't say a dwarf  and a regular-sized  human are completely  two different things.  It's the same.  Don't you need a woman  that you have to  search for something?  Not that.  No, no.  I don't want anything  that I might mistake  for a C.  Well, if you were  ever with me, you  would know that it's  completely opposite.  No.  Sounds like you're  a little bit homophobic.  Well, when it comes  to C-sucking, yeah.  Yeah, call me crazy.  I'm a homophobe that  I don't want a C-sucking 
[02:09:00]  in my mouth.  You know something  a little bit, if you  were with a girl that  has a bigger one, you  would know that it is  nothing near or close  what a male-  All right, Rhonda,  Rhonda, Rhonda, Rhonda,  Rhonda, Rhonda.  That's what I'm trying  to say.  I've never seen one  that big in my life.  I understand what  you're saying.  Girls have, they're  all different sizes.  Some you can't even  find.  Does it launch C-sucking  into guys' faces?  I love the beep  button.  But that one is  very large and it  has an unusual shape 
[02:09:30]  to it.  It seems like it has  an ability to speak.  Ability to what?  It's very, it is very  out there, let's just  say.  And it does resemble  all the parts that a  guy would be familiar  with.  Nah.  Nah.  You want to give  out your website so  people can check it  out for themselves?  Yeah.  Definitely.  They can come to  Rhonda's Playpen.com.  Rhonda's Playpen.com?  You got it.  Okay.  Well, thank you, Rhonda.  Well, thank you, guys.  All right.  You have a good day.  All right.  Bye.  You can go to  chickswithb***.com. 
[02:10:00]  No, no, no.  The voice is a little  off a little.  It made me kind of  hot, though.  I've got to be honest.  I love when a girl  has something like  that and then goes  to explain to men  that that's what  they want.  You know, because  the bottom line is  no.  No.  A guy does not  want something that  big in that area  of a woman.  If you're into men,  that's what you're  doing down there.  Who needs the  competition?  Right.  Something slapping 
[02:10:30]  you in the nose  while you're...  It's like mine's  small enough as it  is.  I don't need to  feel inferior when  I'm down there  doing my business.  You're going to  put an eye out  with that.  The rest of it  looks crazy.  The rest of it  looks completely  normal.  It looks fine.  Yeah.  Give it a very  high rating.  It's just you  got to take a  couple of points  away for having  the C there.  Kind of looks  like a swollen  tonsil or that  thing in the back  of your throat  that goes on.  The punching bag.  The punching bag.  And she knows  that she has it  because she's like...  Oh no, she's proud  of it.  She was... 
[02:11:00]  Put it this way.  And she makes  a lot of money  off that.  It was...  She was manipulating.  She was manipulating  as a guy would.  She was able to do  that when you're  alone.  You know what I  mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was working  it with the...  Squeezing.  Yeah, there's just  a little work in it  going on there.  And it looked...  Did you see the  look of it?  It had all the  components.  It winked at me.  It had all the  components.  No, it did not  look like the  Devil's Tower  from Close 
[02:11:30]  Encounters.  Everyone is saying  it's possible to  have a small  blank as a blank.  Well, remember...  Genetically, she's  a female, but she  has low estrogen.  Lisa, I'm a nurse.  You could be both,  Rhonda.  But what is the  estrogen...  Her problem is  due to hormone  imbalance.  You guys are  effing tools.  Those things come  in various sizes.  Big ones are rare,  but they do exist.  We know they  exist.  Hey, you got  V in my junk.  We're not saying  we know it all.  You got junk in  my V. 
[02:12:00]  Two great freaky  traits together in  one.  Steve's going to  link the video to  foundrymusic.com in  a little while.  You know what you  do down there,  right?  You know what you  do when you  venture south  into that area.  You know, right?  You go there,  you work in it,  you do it.  You know what...  Everyone out there  knows their personal  little moves that  they do with that  area when you go  south.  You work it like  a speed bag.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like you  drive a certain 
[02:12:30]  way every time,  say, to get to  Nebraska, and then  you're going through  the field, and then  all of a sudden  there's a tower in  the field.  And like, hey,  there was ever a  tower in that field?  Exactly.  You know what's  there.  You know how you  work it.  The last thing  you want is  something there  that you're not  used to that  would be similar  to something you  have.  Because then,  you're not going  to work it like  you normally  work what you're  used to.  You're going to  have to sit there  and go, oh, oh, oh,  oh, on this mini.  Oh, my God. 
[02:13:00]  What are you going  to do?  What are you going  to do?  You're going to, oh,  oh, oh, you work  around it.  You work around it.  You work around it.  You never, oh, oh,  oh, you work around  it.  Hey, hey, that's why  I want no part of  that.  No, see, you can't  help yourself.  There's going to be a  time, oh, oh, oh,  there would be a part  where you would, oh, oh,  oh, oh.  What are you going  to do with it?  You may believe it's  the heavy bag instead  of the speed bag.  What are you going  to do with it?  Work around it.  That's too big to 
[02:13:30]  work around.  More body blows, my  friend.  More body blows.  Don't go for the  face.  You go to somebody's  house for dinner,  they make you a  beautiful pot roast  with potatoes and  string beans.  You don't like  string beans, you eat  around the string  beans.  No matter what, you  never, but it seems  to me like it demands  it.  No, no, you  know what it is?  It shows a lot about  what you do.  I'm just saying, you  know how you work.  What happens?  Look, look, look,  you know how you 
[02:14:00]  work the area.  Yeah, look, we  still like a speed  bag.  No, but there's  many different moves.  There's not just the  body blows.  Right.  You, at some point,  you do use the entire  area and it is  completely covered and  there is some, some  of that going on.  Nice try.  No, no, no, no.  I'm not saying, I'm  not saying.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  You said oh, oh, oh.  And you're trying to  back it up.  That move would have  to come out of your  repertoire when something  is that big.  Too bad we have to be 
[02:14:30]  great.  I would never do that.  Because this could be a  solid hour of  oh, oh, oh, oh.  I'm not saying, I am  saying that we wouldn't  have to do that.  Hey, everybody, if you're  listening up, Anthony  likes to see.  He's into the sea big  time, trying to justify it.  Anthony has come out,  everybody.  He's come out.  There he is.  Maybe it was the  plane crash, threats of  anthrax.  Go for the sea.  Go f*** yourself.  Give him a big hand.  Make him.  Take that f*** in  bullhorn and stick it  up your f***. 
[02:15:00]  I learned a very  No beeping when you're  beeping yourself.  It disrupts the whole.  I learned a very  valuable lesson today.  No matter what it  looks like, never  walk, walk, walk.  Never walk, walk.  I'm not saying walk, walk.  I am saying there is a  move that involves the  upper and lower lip.  Okay.  Right.  It is almost a move that  holds a certain thing in  place while you bat it  around with your tongue. 
[02:15:30]  What?  Aren't you listening to  what I'm saying?  Punch out, Maverick.  Punch out.  I am so confident in  this that I am not  saying a word.  Punch out.  I am not punching out.  There is something you  do when you head south.  But that has nothing to  do with what is that?  That's why I'm saying  if you are with a woman  that has that, it would  take that right out of  the mix.  Because I'm saying  that's exactly what I'm  saying.  No, you didn't say that.  You're totally backtracking.  You're such a politician.  Get a job in Bloomberg's 
[02:16:00]  administration.  That is not what you  said.  I am saying that if she  had something that big  would take that move  right out of the mix,  you can now go to  break.  I explained myself  completely.  Oh, and I'm sure the  listeners are going to  buy it.  Get your hands off my  seat.  And some rope  swallower.  Get your hands off my  seat.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  That's great.  Wah, wah, wah has  never been funnier.  All right, why don't we  go to the FU line as  we take a break?  What?  I've got to go do  the thing.  Oh, you're picking up  your Emmy? 
[02:16:30]  Is that where you've  got to go?  I've got to go do  the thing.  He's got to go to the  Daily Show.  Hope and stuff.  Paul?  Paul, where?  Paul?  He's on the phone with  some important people.  Is that the Emmy  award winning cell phone?  That Emmy award winning  ideas were past Emmy  award winningly?  The crowd's waiting,  isn't it?  Are they waiting?  I don't know why  they're waiting.  I subject myself to  this part.  You put yourself out,  Dan.  All right.  Well, we'll take a  break.  The Emmy award winning 
[02:17:00]  Paul Mercurio from the  Daily Show on Comedy  Central.  He's playing Carolines  tomorrow night.  Yes.  Check him out.  I have to check that  out tomorrow.  Maybe.  All right.  Bring the microphone.  They have one there.  It's part of the deal.  That and the bowling  ball.  It's all part of the  act now.  Anthony?  Yeah.  You don't even have to  say it.  He's out of here.  Get easy.  We're going to hit the  F.U. line.  We'll be back.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the opiate  Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, this message is for  Brian and the  computer.  The dirtball. 
[02:17:30]  All the time you're  leaving your crap in the  toilet so everybody can  freaking see it and  putting your boogers  everywhere.  Take a freaking shower,  you slime ass.  F.U.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a  big F.U. to  teriyaki flavor top  ramen noodles.  They really blow.  Decent.  Next message.  Hi, um, is this every  radio station in America?  Could I make a request?  Could I request every  single song that you  played yesterday? 
[02:18:00]  Because I don't think  that I've heard it  enough.  I need to hear it one  more freaking time.  Over and over and  over again.  All the same crap.  Every f***ing day.  I can't stand it  anymore.  All these f***ing  stations.  Jesus.  3 o'clock, please.  End of message.  Have you ever seen  the people that  listen to this show?  O.B. and Anthony.  Truth is drunk  and quite trash. 
[02:18:30]  I got drooled.  You're checking out  the O.B. and Anthony  show.  Veena.  Yeah.  Is next on the  O.B. and Anthony  show.  What's up, Veena?  Hey.  Hey.  Veena.  Did you guys want to  know about, what  girl can be 90% female  and 10% male, like  you said?  Yeah.  Well, basically, like  during the fetal  development, I mean,  all people start out  looking the same,  looking sort of  female.  And if testosterone 
[02:19:00]  comes at the right  time, the baby  develops as a male.  But if it doesn't, or  if not enough of it  comes, then the  external genitalia  ends up looking  female.  So, she could be  sort of one of those  in-betweens.  Ah.  Well, this thing, the  man in the boat is  very, very large on  Rhonda.  Right.  Yeah, that happens.  I think the guy  mentioned before,  Jamie Lee Curtis.  Yeah.  She's actually  genetically a male.  She's an XY  chromosome. 
[02:19:30]  But because she  didn't, her testosterone  and receptors actually  weren't working right,  she developed as a  female.  See, I've heard this,  but I've heard it is  an urban legend.  No.  She had to adopt  kids, Anthony.  No, yeah, she had  to adopt kids.  She has no uterus and  she has undefended  testes.  Oh, my God.  Yep.  Nigel Tufnell's got to  put up a bat.  And that is, that's,  that's her.  I didn't know she was  married.  You what?  No, I want, I want  women's reproductive 
[02:20:00]  organs.  I don't want this.  No, if I fold it,  then I just have  folded junk.  I want women's  reproductive organs.  I guess you'd have  to transplant them.  I don't know.  All right, Vina,  thank you.  Sure, no problem.  It's awful.  Look, look, I look,  I look at a normal  girl, there's nothing.  I look at my wife and  look, there's a little  guy.  It's a catastrophe,  but I will rise above.  I'm a professional. 
[02:20:30]  I will rise above.  Jason, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, man, me and my  friends have a word for  what you guys were  talking about with the  girl.  What?  We call it cleanest.  A cleanest?  Why does she have a  cleanest?  Exactly.  A cleanest.  That's pretty good.  I think we will adopt  that.  We like the cleanest.  Thanks, yeah.  We don't like the  cleanest.  We like the word  cleanest.  Yeah, we like the word  cleanest.  We use it all the time.  I'm staying out of  this one, man.  Thank you, Jason.  No problem.  The video should be up  on foundrymusic.com so 
[02:21:00]  you can check this thing  out for yourself, man,  because it's pretty damn  interesting, right?  No, don't touch it.  Don't even look at it.  Look.  See, here's my wife.  Still got the old  cleanest on it.  No, don't touch it.  Anthony Steve from  foundrymusic.com is in  the studio.  That can mean only one  thing.  Yes.  Yeah, got the link up.  It's right on the  homepage.  It's linked right to the  video.  Very easy to find.  So go to foundrymusic.com 
[02:21:30]  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y  foundrymusic.com.  That's the wrong girl.  Oh, it is?  Yeah, they put the  Adam's apple on.  All right.  All right.  Foundrymusic.com has  the video.  Check it out for  yourself.  Give us a call, okay?  The link is also on  opiananthony.com.  That's her.  That one, Ben.  The one that looks  like she could be  5% man.  She's got no uterus.  But you're a boy  to make a big noise.  Playing in the streets  is going to be a big  man someday. 
[02:22:00]  The Pope going to  foundry?  Well, the Pope  discovered the  Internet recently,  Anthony.  Yeah.  81 years old.  And he finally  decided he was going  to speak out about  the Internet.  Yeah.  This just in.  Pope John Paul,  who writes most of  his speeches by hand  and does not own a  computer, will dedicate  his message for World  Communications Day to  the Internet, the  Vatican said Tuesday.  The Vatican said the  81-year-old Pope has  chosen the theme,  Internet, a new forum  for proclaiming the 
[02:22:30]  gospel, a new forum  for the yearly message  which will be published  on January 24th.  The Roman Catholic  Church will mark  World Communications  Day on May 12th next  year, but the message  is published earlier  in order to allow  churches around the  world to prepare.  The Pope's aides make  no secret of the fact  that he is a  technological loot-it.  He still writes  his speeches and  documents by hand or  dictates them to aides.  dictates, I don't even  know her.

[02:25:30]  Yes.  They really  up Napster.  I used to  download some  good  off of  Napster.  All right.  Nice chant  music, though.  81.  A new  forum for  proclaiming the  gospel.  Give me  a dime  so I  can call  my mother  If you 
[02:26:00]  want my  father  And you  think I'm  sexy  Okay.  Back to the  cleanest.  All right.  People are now  checking out the  video for  themselves.  Sal, what's  up?  Oh, what's  up?  Hey.  Checking out the  picture.  I can see what  you guys are  talking about.  It's got like  three different  sections.  You got the  helmet.  Wait, wait, wait,  wait, wait.  Slow down, because  we got an idiot on  the dump button  that has decided  we can't talk  about farts  anymore.  Okay.  The three  sections, you 
[02:26:30]  know what I'm  talking about.  There's the  inner tube, let's  say, the ring.  Hold on, hold on,  Sal.  Yeah.  Because I'm  convinced our  audience is pretty  smart and they  can fill in the  blanks.  Yeah.  You just saw the  video of the  cleanest on  foundingmusic.com.  Yes, I did.  And what you  want to say is  that there are  three sections.  Right.  That's all you  need to say.  Three sections.  Beginning, middle,  and end, so to  speak.  Right, exactly.  We understand what  three sections means.  Very good.  But you can see  that, right?  Yes, very  clearly.  Okay, thank  you.  It's not just  like the 
[02:27:00]  normal man  in the boat.  It's very  detailed with  all the little  detail of  man junk on  that little  man in the  boat.  Well, big  man in the  boat.  Very big  man in the  boat.  Like a pinky  sized thing with  all the disgusting  detail of the  male.  Like Gwyneth  Paltrow in the  front of that  canoe.  Yeah, right.  And a preview  for Shallow  Howl.  All right,  Anthony.  Yeah.  A lot of  people checking 
[02:27:30]  in.  They want to  know how we're  giving away  these Xboxes  later this week.  Well, please.  We got two to  give away.  One this week  and one maybe  next week.  How's that  sound?  Yeah.  Spread it out  a little bit.  This Thursday  we're giving  away an Xbox  and we're going  to play the  game Cherry  Darts for the  Xbox.  Yep.  Rick, you  got to call  Privileged  Gentlemen's  Club because we  can't count on  our female  listeners to help  us out because  they always bail  on us.  We can't have  a girl with  a cleanest.  No.  That might knock  the cherry  Privileged 
[02:28:00]  Gentlemen's  Club.  And basically  Anthony, you  want to explain  this?  Yeah.  We're going to  take a girl  and hopefully  she's nice and  shaved down.  Well, she has  to be, right?  Yeah.  We'll have guys  that we decide  are going to  come in here.  How are we  going to pick  them?  We'll have that  figured out  tomorrow.  Okay.  We're going to  do this Thursday  definitely.  And then we'll  have a bunch  of cherries with  some kind of  what are we  going to use?  Whipped cream  type topping,  maybe frosting,  something that  will make the 
[02:28:30]  cherry stick  really good.  And the girl  will be across  the room and  your job is  to get a  bullseye.  Get closest to  the bullseye  area.  Right.  With the  cherry.  Just take  darts.  Yeah.  Darts.  And the  closest is  going to win.  Exactly.  If it's a  tie, there'll  be some kind  of a shoot  off.  Yeah, we'll  have someone  that's going  to measure  how close  to the  Maybe we  can flip  around and  go for a  shoot off.  Hey, that's  not a bad idea.  With the real  cork.  That's not a bad idea.  Shoot for cork.  That's really  not a bad idea,  man.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  All right, so  we're going to  do that Thursday.  We'll figure out  how you can  come down and  participate in  the cherry  darts for the  Xbox, okay?  Yes.  And then we  have another  Xbox to give  away next week  possibly, and  we're asking  the mommies out  there, Mommy,  what would you  do to your  box for an  Xbox?  So sleep on  that one and  give us a call  and let us  know, Mommy.  That's pretty  self-explanatory.  Yeah.  Bunch of  mommies out  there, Christmas  coming up, maybe  you can't afford  that Xbox that  your little son 
[02:29:30]  has been crying  for.  Maybe you want  to buy his  love, but you  can't afford it.  Right.  We're giving  you a chance  to do  something to  your box for  an Xbox.  That's right.  It's wide  open.  Oh, of course  it is.  Wide open.  Anything goes  with this one.  Be creative.  Be creative is  right.  Like we said  earlier, we had  a lady shoot a  bottle rocket.  Yeah.  That was a  winner.  That was a  winner.  I liked that.  I forgot what  we gave her, but  okay.  And yes, we did 
[02:30:00]  the Britney Spears  tickets.  That's what we  gave her.  Britney Spears  tickets.  And a limo  ride.  And a limo  ride.  We had the  cell phone.  Huh?  Remember the  cell phone trick  we did?  That would be  another contender  for that.  See if a cell  phone will answer.  See if a cell  phone will answer  in, I don't  know, one of  those no-call  zones.  You know, I'm  surprised she was  able to get it  there.  Right.  But she did, and  for some reason it  didn't ring when we  called it.  So there you go, 
[02:30:30]  mommies.  Take that one for  the second Xbox  that we'll be  giving away, okay?  Yes.  All right.  Oh, as we take a  break here, Ann, and  set up for what do  we learn on the  Opie and Anthony  show?  Yeah.  Remember we were  talking about  feels for meals.  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to try  to do this again for  three years running.  Try, like, five  years running.  Once again, we're  going to try to do  feels for meals.  New York certainly  could use the help.  Yeah.  And we want to  raise a lot of  money.  Sure.  For a good cause.  And we're going to 
[02:31:00]  talk to the lawyers  later on this week to  see if we can work  out feels for meals  once again this year.  I think it'll work.  Never works.  Basically, we get  boxes, big, huge  boxes, and we put  topless women inside  the boxes, and  people line up on  the streets.  Cop a feel.  And they do the  feeling, and in  return, we do the  meal-in.  Yeah, they make  donations.  That's right.  And for their  donation, they get  to cop a feel.  They bring canned  goods or cold hard 
[02:31:30]  cash, and they step  up to the box.  Two holes are cut  out of the box, and  they're tuning in  Tokyo, and they move  on.  I don't understand  what the problem is  with this, because  everyone wins.  Everyone wins.  Everyone wins, and  the homeless get  fed, and for some  reason, we can't do  it.  But we'll try again.  So last year, we  came close.  We were able to do  it in the studio for  a while.  Oh, we came so  close.  So we set up a box in  the studio.  Yes, Rick.  Yeah, we came really  close.  We had places lined up  and all that stuff. 
[02:32:00]  That's what I mean by  being really close.  Like we were very  close.  Yes, we know.  Real close.  And so we were able  to set up a box in  the studio for a  while, and we had  some fun.  We had this lovely  girl, Wendy, who  wanted Jim Brewer  tickets really bad.  So we did an incest  feels for meals.  Yeah, that was a  wonderful moment that  was.  I refreshed my  memory, but I think  we lined up four or  five guys, and Wendy  had to figure out  which one was her  brother feeling her 
[02:32:30]  up.  It was her brother,  her blood brother,  not adopted, not  half or step.  It was her blood  brother that felt  her up.  Right.  How great is that?  So it went down  like this.  So Wendy's going to  get into the feels  for meals box because  we got a couple guys  from Penthouse taking  photographs for their  website, Anthony.  Nice.  All right, Wendy,  get in the goddamn  box.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait, hold on.  Who's the brother?  Hold on. 
[02:33:00]  Let's step on the  brake pedal real quick.  I can't check out  your sister if you're  in here.  Look, look.  Dude, you're her  brother.  Yes.  And she is blood  brother?  Yes.  Topless.  Dude, you got to  like do it.  In the box.  No, man.  You wouldn't feel  your sister's boobies?  Why not?  No.  Rick, break out  the prize list.  What do we got?  Dude, what would  you do?  What would it take?  What would it take  to get you?  To feel up your own  sister.  To feel up your  sister.  What would it take?  Brewer tickets. 
[02:33:30]  Brewer tickets.  We can do that.  We can absolutely  get you brewer tickets.  Brewer tickets.  But now somebody's  got to confirm  because he could  just put his hands in.  Put my shirt on?  No.  What?  No.  That's my brother.  Yeah, but that's okay.  That's why it's, you know,  cool.  Oh, like people  haven't squeezed  their sister's boobs.  Jeff, step over  to the box.  Oh, yeah.  You got to guess  which hands  are your brother's.  Someone's going to  have to look in  and make sure 
[02:34:00]  that there's contact  and it's not just  an errant little  brush of a nip.  All right.  Wendy is blindfolded.  She's blindfolded  in the box.  Oh, God.  All right.  You guys are guaranteed  the Jim Brewer tickets.  If you guess  which one is your  brother feeling you up,  you get to meet  Jim Brewer backstage.  You cannot say a word.  No saying a word.  And no, like,  little Morse code  tweaks or anything.  You just got to do  what everyone else does.  What we will do here,  gentlemen,  and you will step  up to the box,  put your hands in, 
[02:34:30]  grab a hold,  give a little,  you know,  juggle,  little, little  bouncy bounce,  little feelage,  little brushing  with the hands,  and then you step away.  Then the next guy goes.  This is what we should do.  Everyone gets a feel.  Give each one  of these guys a number  and then Wendy's got to guess  what number was the brother.  Are we ready?  This game is called,  this game is called  guess which one  is your brother  feeling you up.  Feeling you up.  Now,  very popular game  in South Carolina.  Okay. 
[02:35:00]  Rick,  or somebody,  the most important part  of this is confirmation  of contact.  Okay.  Okay.  Number one,  step right up  to the box.  That's...  No talking.  Number one.  All right.  Wendy?  All right.  Number two,  step up to the box.  Step up.  And he puts his arms in.  Okay.  Very good.  There is number two.  All right.  Number three is  stepping up to the box.  Both hands, sir.  All right. 
[02:35:30]  Okay.  Number four.  All right.  Number four.  Number five.  Number five.  And finally,  number six.  Yep.  All right.  Here comes number six.  All right.  And here's number seven.  People are coming in the studio.  Number seven. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  Okay.  All right,  Wendy,  everyone in the studio  has felt you up.  For the backstage passes  to meet Jim Brewer,  which number was your brother?  Between three and four.  Four?  Three?  All right.  Is that your final answer?  You need one.  Would you like three and four  to feel you up again? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Maybe you got to get  three and four again.  Yeah.  Three and four again.  Three and four.  Line up to the box.  You seem a little confused.  So,  number three,  if you can step up to the box again.  Number three.  Up to the box.  Now,  three and four.  Two hands.  All right.  That's number three.  Yep.  All right.  And number four.  All right,  Wendy,  for the meet and greet  with Jim Brewer,  which one  was your brother?  Three? 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Number three.  You called up your sister.  Time to show rules.  What?  What?  What?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Welcome  to the bottomless  pit of ignorance.  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony show.  F-ing hilarious.  Yeah, the boys are in town tonight, Anthony. 
[02:37:30]  Anthony.  Carol Smith playing the settee.  Yeah.  Ah, and we're not talking about Worcester.  And we're not talking about Worcester.  Someone out there got that.  How was the Disturbed show the other night, Anthony?  Kicked ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Drowning Bull and Disturbed.  Drowning Bull and Disturbed.  There were some bands on before them, but I didn't get there in time.  Yeah, they kicked ass.  The pit was ridiculous. 
[02:38:00]  People just beating the living crap out of each other.  Right up front, we were safely in one of the side boxes.  And Ben, you kept like leaning over the side of the rail like you were going to hit somebody.  No, no.  I was going down with the music, like trying to grab people.  Yeah.  Coolest thing.  We were like above everyone.  Yeah, it was like you were flying over the crowd.  Yeah, he was flying over the crowd.  I want to thank our friends at Reprise Records for the nice box. 
[02:38:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Nice box.  They gave you a nice box, huh?  Nice box.  Those guys are sick, though.  Guy.  Was it a tight fit in the box?  A tight fit in the box.  Actually, no.  It was actually a loose box.  Yeah.  It was a loose box.  Plenty of room in the box?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The singer comes out in like some rolling gas chamber.  He has some Nazis gas him.  And then the lights go out and he comes out and kicks ass the singer.  You know, he's making a statement. 
[02:39:00]  Disturbed.  They showed some disturbing images beforehand.  A little movie screen pull down.  They weren't going to find, you know, show nice images.  No.  It's got to be disturbing.  Disturbing.  And they're showing like video footage of assassinations and carnage and wars.  And then they got to the point they got Earl chuckling a little bit.  It was some of the riots down south in the 60s.  Right, Earl?  All right, Earl.  Calm down. 
[02:39:30]  But they kick ass.  Sound just like they do on the CD, too.  Yeah.  Sound great live.  He's got all those...  All right.  You know, we should get to what do we learn because there's a lot of them today.  We should start this early.  I learned what a cleanest is.  West Coast Dave.  I do believe we all did. 
[02:40:00]  Okay.  Let me start with Cochise.  I learned today the Pope has AIDS.  What?  Well, he has helpers.  Sure.  Oh, in that story, it said, you know, the Pope hopes AIDS.  Yeah.  Of course.  He has helpers.  The Pope has helpers.  West Coast Dave was on...  He's on fire today, Anthony.  I learned that I really can't be...  Wait.  I'm sorry.  My brain is way too fast today.  West Coast Dave.  I learned that I really can be relieved at the same time I learned that 300 people died. 
[02:40:30]  I also learned when a disaster occurs, all that matters is who was first on the scene.  I also learned that I should never wake up in the morning and turn on the effing news.  This is all from West Coast Dave.  Jeremy, a whole list here, Anthony.  Oh, good.  I learned Anthony sucks cleanest.  I do not.  He also learned the Pope discovered the Internet today.  He learned Anthony awoke at the same time lightning struck the clock tower.  He also learned Rube McClanahan's taint opened the door for sexual innuendos on TV. 
[02:41:00]  He also learned the Pope can't find anything on foundrymusic.com, which does have that video right now as we speak.  And I think we crashed the website, didn't we?  Yeah.  It's the first time I've seen a foundry go down in quite a while.  So a little later, check out foundrymusic.com so you can check out the cleanest for yourself.  We want a full report tomorrow.  Black girl's dream is bigger than MLK's dream.  And Jamie Lee Curtis has big cans and a nice cleanest.  Brian from the Bronx said, I learned the Golden Girls had a touching episode about Blanche's cancer titled Tainted Love. 
[02:41:30]  Tainted Love.  Hey, Joe, what did you learn on the show today?  You never ah, ah, you work around it.  That's right.  Ah, ah.  You never ah, ah, ah.  Three.  Much funnier with tree.  Right.  Let's go to Mikey.  Hey, Mikey, what did you learn today?  Well, sadly, I learned what the cleanest is as well as you guys did.  Yeah.  I also learned that your brain moves a little too fast for you. 
[02:42:00]  I just learned that.  And you are a couple of oxymorons because in your contest, you stated you're not going to depend on the female listeners to, you know, help you out because they always bail on you.  Yeah.  But then the very next breath, you say, Mommy, what are you going to do to your box to get the Xbox, which is back to depending on the female listeners you don't want to depend on.  Oh, my God.  You're too smart to listen to the show, I think.  No, I'm not.  That's why I love you, guys.  All right.  Well, Thursday, we're definitely doing cherry darts for the Xbox. 
[02:42:30]  Guaranteed.  Your chance to be a contestant starts tomorrow on the show, okay?  Nice.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Let's move on to Dennis.  Dennis, what did you learn on the show today?

WWF Raw is in Boston tonight performing at the Fleet Center starts at 745.

[02:43:30]  It's a very bad version.  That's a tool.  Music played over the phone, never good.  Jesse, what's up?  Hey, yeah.  I learned today that Opie thinks the dude from Pulp Fiction took the plane down today.  The dude with the flock of seagulls haircut.  Oh, hey, flock of seagulls.  Yeah, but he couldn't because Jules killed him.  All right.  All right, thanks, Ed.  Thank you. 
[02:44:00]  Hey, flock of seagulls.  Ah, flock of seagulls.  Caroline, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  All right.  I learned that Paul Mercurio won the Golden Megaphone.  Yes.  And I also learned that at least one of your other listeners knows what an oxymoron is.  Yes.  That's it.  Do I have to have three?  I know things are funnier than threes, but I only have two.  Oh, that's fine.  Yeah, that's good.  No, no, celebrities die in threes.  Oh, O.J. Simpson's mother died.  Yeah, I know, and we didn't even touch on that.  I didn't kill her, I swear. 
[02:44:30]  It wasn't me.  Now I have no one's house to drive to after I kill somebody.  All right.  Jim from PA, I learned that O&A listeners are smart enough to figure out what three sections refer to.  Also, I learned that Opie becomes a retard when he watches a chick shoot a bottle rocket from that area.  I learned, this is Stinky Rules in Jersey.  I learned today the World Trade Center guy is going to be in a new picture.  Yeah.  Don, I learned that the man in the boat is wearing a helmet, steer clear and punch out as fast as you can. 
[02:45:00]  Casino, from hell, I learned to thank God that it was only a plane crash.  Maury thinks Ozzy is special.  I learned two things.  No matter what, you never, and two, all Opie needs to know is, is it possible?  Earl Stradamus.  They learned that there's an Earl Stradamus. 
[02:45:30]  John, what did you learn on the show today?  John.  Hello.  Hey, man.  That's a delay.  Turn on the radio and then talk.  Go.  I learned today that Alex is a racist douchebag.  Yes.  Very good.  I'm glad someone remembered that one.  Thank you.  You guys suck.  Thank you, Mike.  Thanks, Alex.  And Chris, what did you learn on the show today?  Oh, let's see.

Hey, guys.  Hey.  On Friday, I was listening, and I heard that Mario Cantone knows me.  Yeah.  The way he knows me is my aunt works for him.  Oh, really?  And my dad is a friend of his.  Oh, good. 
[02:46:30]  And a friend of his.  Shut up, Anthony.  What's with that voice?  What are you doing?  No, it's a different voice when they go and call you on the phone.  No, like you got a raspy voice like you've been smoking cigarettes.  I don't know.  I took my tonsils out.  No.  You took them out yourself?  I'll be quiet.  You just decided to take your tonsils out?  Young Gary.  All right, Gary, you got to call us earlier next time because we're out.  I will.  We're out of show.  All right.  See you, guys.  All right.
