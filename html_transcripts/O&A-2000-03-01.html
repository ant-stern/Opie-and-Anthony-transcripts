<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with the hosts' disparaging remarks about Long Island housewives on the Long Island Railroad, followed by a recounting of their ejection from Howard Stern's press conference, which they claimed was intended to be a show of support.  This led to a debate about Stern's perceived paranoia and accusations of Opie and Anthony copying his show, fueled by a caller accusing them of stealing bits.  The hosts denied these accusations.  Other topics discussed included the closing of *Cats*, the Smashing Pumpkins' new CD, an unusual listener-described hairstyle, and a planned listener-organized "WOW" parade featuring a lit-up sign.  Several radio personalities were mentioned, including Howard Stern, Imus, Man Cow, Mike and the Mad Dog, Don and Mike, and Ron and Fez. A caller discussed her boyfriend's participation in a "Hummer Tuesday" event.  The hosts also briefly discussed Tom Green's MTV show featuring Monica Lewinsky and expressed their intention to get Lewinsky on their own show.  Psycho Mark, described as "the most dangerous man in media history," was mentioned as being present at Stern's press conference.

The show then featured a call from "Sue" alleging that "triple nipple," a participant in the show's "Girls of O&A" website section, was a prostitute, providing details about her alleged pricing and services.  Opie, Anthony, and Steve, the website administrator, discussed this, with Steve also mentioning vote manipulation issues on the website and upcoming vacation giveaways.  The conversation shifted to the planned "wow" event at MTV's TRL, detailing Psychomark's involvement and the disruption caused by the receptionist inadvertently releasing the show's confidential phone numbers.  Psychomark's experience at TRL, including interactions with police, was recounted.  A sexually suggestive call from Marissa followed, before the show returned to discussing the TRL event, the receptionist's actions, Opie's upcoming California trip, and Opie's recollection of losing his virginity at 13.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on listener calls.  Many callers shared anecdotes about a sexual act they called "earning their Red Wings," involving menstruation.  The show also discussed the Amadou Diallo shooting and subsequent protests, featuring calls from several police officers sharing their perspectives and experiences, including a heated exchange with a civilian. A Suffolk County police officer discussed differences in policing between Suffolk County and New York City.  A juror, Rick, called in to discuss jury duty, leading to speculation about a defendant's race. Another caller recounted a humorous interaction with his sex-ed teacher after asking a question about vaginas previously discussed on the show.

The show further explored perceived safety in different neighborhoods, focusing on racial and socioeconomic disparities in crime rates, and a lengthy debate ensued between a caller, Vanjie, and a New Jersey police officer, Joe, about police use of force in a recent incident. Two men who held a "WOW" sign seen on a Channel 7 news broadcast appeared in studio, followed by more callers, including a police officer offering a different perspective.  Bridget, a previous participant in the "Make Bridget Cry" segment, came to the studio, recounting a story about an ex-boyfriend and participating in a new "Make Bridget Cry" segment.  A game called "What's in Bridget's Pants," involving guessing the shape of her underwear based on sounds, concluded the segment.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts and callers frequently used highly offensive and sexually explicit language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I'm Opie and Anthony.  Well, you guys are both stupid. You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  Opie and Anthony.  You know, I just like want to throw up.  Feel the love.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  So, on this fine, fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[00:00:30]  Well, that's kind of nice out.  Kind of gray.  Kind of spring-like, though.  It was kind of nice out when I got in.  The weather has changed, I guess, a bit.  I did a little music break there.  Smashing Pumpkins.  A track off their latest CD, Machina.  The Machines of God.  That's the Everlasting Gaze.  Foo Fighters before that, Everlong.  Is he still sporting the Uncle Festa look?  Yes, he is.  Billy Corrigan, sure.  The CD rocks, Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  I jam it on the Long Island Railroad so I don't have to listen to all the housewives.  Yapping and talking about what Broadway show they're coming into the city to see.  The best present I got this Christmas was a city walkman.  Yeah.  I could tune everyone out.  I could tune cell phone guy out.  I could tune these old housewives that come in for the Broadway shows.  Yes, I'm seeing Jekyll and Hyde. 
[00:01:30]  Right.  I'm going to stop at the Hard Rocker.  Look at Elvis' clothes.  No, it's usually like the Carnegie Deli or, you know.  Yeah.  They got it all figured out.  Lunch and a Broadway show.  Great.  Keep it to yourself.  I'm going to work.  Wonderful.  It was fabulous.  Singing was fabulous.  I don't know what's in the water on Long Island, but man, there is no hope for us.  Have you seen the show? 
[00:02:00]  It's wonderful.  Did you hear Cats is closing?  You know, I've never respected the show, but since it's closing, I'm going to have to catch it.  Just for the fact that it's been there so long.  I mean.  And I do so enjoy Broadway, the theater, that I have to.  Get me another Paul Morse, please.  Anthony, are you officially gay if your, like, wife of 30 years starts sounding like that? 
[00:02:30]  I mean, these women on the tram, like, there's nothing feminine about them anymore.  They turn into men.  Are you officially gay if your wife turns into one of those?  I think it's all the sumps out on Long Island.  God damn, what's in the water?  It's the sump.  The hell's in the water?  Hello.  Right.  That's exactly how they started this morning.  Where do you want to eat lunch?  Do you have a light, darling?  Then they got the fake hair that's been sprayed and, ah, the lacquered, friggin' Ronald McDonald orange hair. 
[00:03:00]  Who asks for that color?  Ronald McDonald orange, please, just the way I get it every week, darling.  I'm going to the parlor this month.  The parlor?  The parlor.  I'm going to the parlor.  They got that friggin' football helmet hair, though.  Man, it's like an orange Julius color.  We say it all the time, but time is just a bitch.  I'm sure they were hot Bettys in the day.  Oh, my God.  And now they're just like, they look like Ronald McDonald. 
[00:03:30]  They talk like men.  They got chin hair now.  Picture her running out of, you know, running out of class during school to maybe meet up with her boyfriend and, you know, a little hobbing of the nothing.  No, but, you know, just hooking up, sure.  Probably fun, a little dangerous, cute and stuff.  And then just add a little time.  Why were you late from work today?  You know, you know it's garbage day, and now you have to get back out and take the garbage out. 
[00:04:00]  It's like, what happened?  What happened?  You know, I don't think my wife's been born yet.  Is that how you're headed?  Oh, yeah, that's how I'm going to solve this problem.  She's not born yet.  My wife's not born yet.  Holy crap.  That's pretty good, though.  Because the more and more I listen to these Long Island Bettys, Jesus, on the train, I'm like, oh, my God. 
[00:04:30]  At least, like, I'll be 80 by the time they hit that stage, and it won't matter anymore.  You come home to that.  No, you know, we're still happy.  It's wonderful.  You know, it's 30 years of marriage, and could you shoot me?  Yes, it's all right.  There was four of them in front of me this morning, and I'm jamming the Smashing Pumpkins in my... 
[00:05:00]  This is what's so freaking funny about the Long Island Railroad, because I don't care anymore.  We will never be apart.  Right, right.  So I'm cranking out the new Smashing Pumpkins.  I got the CD.  I've had it for about a week, right?  Yeah.  And I am just checking out the latest issue of Penthouse.  I don't even care anymore.  I used to, like, hide it.  I used to have, like, a Sports Illustrated on top and have the Sports Illustrated cover up and gash on the inside.  You know what I'm saying?  I used to look like that Cinefold, darling.  And I don't even care. 
[00:05:30]  So I'm bopping my head.  I got the Penthouse up high, and they're in front of me.  And I could care less what they're thinking.  Because I can't hear them anyway, because I was cranking up the tunes, you know?  Where you open up to one of the photo shoots where the girls are whizzing on each other.  That'd be a good one.  What is...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The Ronald McDonald art.  That's classic.  And it is.  I remember my grandmother, God rest her soul, she would go to the parlor. 
[00:06:00]  Every...  I mean, it would only be once a month.  And you know she ain't washing her hair, because it has to...  It was like the big asshead creatures on Star Trek.  Remember the first one, the menagerie, the pilot?  Captain Christopher Pike?  She had the big asshead made of just this white hair.  And she'd spray it.  She'd use just wonderful hairspray.  Those big cans.  Like, God forbid she went to turn the light on and it arced or something, the walls would blow out. 
[00:06:30]  It would cause a huge fire.  But she's there, you know, I gotta just spray until I get to the parlor.  Come give your Nana a kiss.  Nana, I need a gas mask to get over there.  There's some hydrofluorocarbons all in the room.  Oh, wow. 
[00:07:00]  So true, though.  And we used to, like, as kids, we would touch our hair.  We'd be like, hey, can I touch your hair?  Can I touch your hair?  She'd be like, sure, touch my hair.  And you'd touch it and you'd be amazed because it wasn't hair.  It was not hair.  It was a space-age polymer.  It was like hard cotton candy.  Yeah, exactly.  Like cotton candy or, like, fiberglass.  Yeah.  You know, it's all lacquered over. 
[00:07:30]  Dan from Long Island on the instant feedback.  Hey, Howard Stern imitators, who shall remain nameless?  Why won't Hollywood Howie mention you guys?  Yeah, obviously he doesn't want to.  Well, for some apparent reason, he can mention everybody else's name when he has a problem with them.  Ever heard him back down from mentioning Imus or DiBella or Man Cow or any one of the other numbers of radio personalities that are on the air?  That he said sucked and have no talent and everything else. 
[00:08:00]  But he mentions them.  For some weird reason, our names are not mentioned.  Everyone knows who the hell he's talking about.  We're flattered.  That means we're not in the same category as the true imitators of your show.  No, I guess he mentioned the other people's names because he figured people would tune over, listen, and go, oh, he's right, they do suck, and then come back to him.  Right.  But for some reason, he won't mention our names.  Interesting.  Ooh, give me a sea breeze, Rob.  KJ from Queens.  He was blatantly dissing you guys today and didn't even have the balls to mention your names. 
[00:08:30]  That's good.  Well, thank you, Mr. Imus.  We appreciate that.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's it.  Uh, how you doing?  It's, uh, 2.53 on, uh, the fan.  This is Howard Stern.  Looking a little familiar, isn't it?  Watch your own movie, man. 
[00:09:00]  Get out of here.  I don't care.  All right, let's go to the phone.  F you.  See what people are saying today.  212-757-1027.  Jeff, you're next on NAW.  What's going on today?  Yo, man, I heard, uh, oh, uh, Howie this morning was dissing you.  Uh, yeah.  And we were told...  He wasn't saying your name or nothing.  He was just saying the two boys.  And we were told we're not allowed to talk about him, uh, you know, throwing a tantrum and  crying like a little baby.  Oh, because we all got to be team players.  And kicking us out of his little press conference.  There you go.  We got to be team players. 
[00:09:30]  We delayed his press conference 20 to 30 minutes because he had to get us out of the room.  Yeah.  I got another thing for you.  What were you afraid of, Howard?  We were just sitting there to check it out.  The company told us to be team players, so we went down to check it out.  That's it.  I'm sorry about him.  You know, he's...  He thought we had this big, huge plan that we were going to, like, try to disrupt his press  conference.  No.  He went over you guys quick.  It's been done.  No, that's fine.  You know, I don't know what he was scared about.  I don't know why he had to cry like a baby to our boss.  We weren't going to do anything.  I think you boys are getting set up at, uh, going to California, though. 
[00:10:00]  Well, whatever.  Thank you, Jeff.  You got it.  And then in the paper, he takes a jab at any W, you know, calling us all imitators  of his show.  Yeah.  He's the biggest rip-off artist there is.  His brand new Son of the Beach TV show.  I think I've seen that done a couple times, Howie.  Police Squad.  Police Squad, airplane movies.  Are you going to acknowledge that?  I'm ripping them off.  He doesn't say he's ripping off the Zucker Brothers and Abrams from the airplane movies 
[00:10:30]  and Police Squad.  That show is an embarrassment, too.  Don't even listen to what you read.  That thing will never make it.  FX should be a shame.  They picked it up.  Every other station, every other TV company in America said no to that thing, including  our own company, CBS.  And we're supposed to be team players and not talk about it or anything.  But we weren't.  We didn't yesterday.  We weren't going to today. 
[00:11:00]  But if he gets on the air and starts talking, I don't want to hear no names were mentioned  because, God damn it, you know who the hell he's talking about.  So what, are we supposed to sit here like a couple of pussies?  You know, I'm tired of it.  The funny thing is, the company thinks we're not team players.  I invented television.  So we figured, what the hell, let's break the ice.  We'll go to his press conference.  We were invited as a radio station.  Yeah, we have the proper credentials and everything.  We sat in the back.  We're like, okay, the company doesn't think we're team players.  Howard's doing a press conference. 
[00:11:30]  I want to check it out.  So we sat in the back row.  We didn't even make a scene.  No, we weren't going to sit up front and try to make a big scene.  We were in back.  Like, you're at a camera range or anything.  If we wanted to start a scene, don't you think we'd sit up front where the cameras were or something?  No, we just wanted to sit there.  You know, excuse me, Howard is a celebrity, you know, in New York City and the country.  He's a celebrity.  It's newsworthy.  We're down there checking it out. 
[00:12:00]  Not for long.  No.  It wasn't long before Mr. Security Man.  Escort us out because everyone made us look like two complete idiots.  I invented the press conference, Rob.  You guys should have saw the looks we got when we were getting escorted out.  That was, guys, just scum.  Like we were the scourge of society.  And we weren't even going to do anything.  We just wanted to show our support.  And the guy that made a career out of sending people to press conferences laughing his ass off as Stuttering John goes into press conferences and just disrupts the whole thing. 
[00:12:30]  And he would just laugh.  And if anybody else threw Stuttering John out, what would Howard say?  Oh, those pussies can't take it.  Don't want to face me.  Don't want to face John.  Don't want to face.  Oh, you throw him out.  Yeah, what's the matter?  You can't take it, you pussy.  We were just sitting there to watch.  He got right on the phone and had us thrown out.  Thrown out.  I invented a pussy, Rob. 
[00:13:00]  The lunch sucked anyway.  Half a dry roast beef sandwich.  Jesus Christ.  Thrown out like the trash that we are.  Made us feel good.  As we attempted to be team players yesterday.  Didn't work.  Little support.  You know, sitting down there.  We were talking to the girl from Fox News.  You know, looking at Penny Crone's face fall.  You know, we were just having a little fun. 
[00:13:30]  That's all.  Wanted to just hang out.  You know what the funniest part of the whole thing is?  They escort Opie and I out of the building.  Out of the Plaza Hotel.  They wouldn't even allow us to leave on our own.  They had to make sure we were going to be out.  And inside, unbeknownst to them, seated is Psycho Mark, who didn't get thrown out because they didn't know who he was.  But the most dangerous man in media history, Psycho Mark, was sitting there the entire press conference. 
[00:14:00]  With R.P.D. right over his shoulder, making sure he didn't say anything.  That's the funny part about that old thing.  Because they probably were all relieved, like, oh, thank God.  Thank God those guys are out of here.  Oh, Opie and Anthony are out of here.  They were going to cause a scene.  Everyone can calm down now.  The trouble is gone.  There it is, Psycho Mark in the middle of the pack of reporters.  I think at one point, though, Psycho Mark did stand up and go, hey, Imus, hey, Imus. 
[00:14:30]  That was after we were thrown out.  We just wanted to hang, team players, little support for Howie and his little TV show and everything.  Because he's going to need all the support he could get for that piece of crap.  And what kind of thanks do we get?  What kind of thanks?  What audience would he think would watch a show like that?  Maybe basically men?  Men, 18 to 49.  18 to 49?  Well, who's the number one show on Afternoon Drive for men, 18 to 49?  Uh-oh. 
[00:15:00]  That would be Mike and the Mad Dog?  Absolutely, Mike and the Mad Dog.  No, we're beating them.  We don't want that out there.  No.  You know, I think if we were all, if everybody wasn't so goddamn paranoid,  that, uh, sure, we might even watch it, talk about it,  and, uh, maybe, uh, bring some more people to his little TV show.  But, F it.  He didn't want us there.  We couldn't sit there. 
[00:15:30]  We couldn't even sit to watch the trailer.  They threw us out before they even rolled the trailer.  Didn't want us there.  He was paranoid we were in the audience.  I'm quite flattered by that.  Ah.  I'm sure if Scott and Todd were there, he wouldn't have made a huge mistake.  Wouldn't have thrown them out.  Of course not.  Anyone else?  I miss.  Mike and the Mad Dog.  Gotta thank you, Howard, for letting me stay.  I saw you throw out Opium and Anthony and those two lowlives.  I like the show. 
[00:16:00]  Nothing better than watching a little tight gash in a bikini.  So that's what happened yesterday.  That's it.  You're right.  We weren't going to say anything, but, I mean, we can't sit back like idiots  while one side gets to lambast us.  It's just the way it is.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, Ann, I was talking about the Smashing Pumpkins CD.  Can we give away a few of these?  Yeah.  Because we definitely got to move on here.  O&A talking out their ass.  No, we're not.  All right. 
[00:16:30]  We just talked the truth.  Talking out our ass.  Isn't that funny?  You just say what happens, yet we're talking out our ass.  Bob, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  All right, Bob.  I called you guys before.  You guys know my voice.  Yeah, of course.  I know.  You charge us all the time.  Now, without just being an idiot puppet,  explain your point.  All right, here's my point.  And please, I won't curse, so don't you.  I've called you guys in the past.  You know that.  Yes.  I listen to you a lot.  I work, and I listen to you guys all day.  Okay.  I listen to Howard my whole life.  Yes.  You guys 100% steal bits. 
[00:17:00]  And I'm not talking about borrowed bits.  I'm talking about you taking exact incidents that he has done, bits he's done.  Like?  I can name a million of them.  Do you want a couple?  Give us a couple of examples of how we've done exactly what Howard has done.  You guys had a guy in there one time,  and you had another guy eat a Twinkie out of his ass, I'll say if that's allowed,  like the Jackie eating the marshmallows out of another guy.  That never happened.  It didn't happen.  I'm telling you, I heard it on your show, and I heard it on the show. 
[00:17:30]  Who ate a Twinkie out of him?  You guys had two freaks come in, and the one guy had to eat marshmallows out of a Twinkie.  That's not true.  It is true.  I heard it.  I'll tell you what happened.  We had a big, fat girl come in and sit on a cake,  and a guy had to eat cake off her ass for tickets.  Now, if you want to, in some convoluted way, try to make it like that's exactly what Howard did,  then Howard invented breathing and walking, too?  No, that's being... 
[00:18:00]  You guys...  Well, you're being a little vague.  I'm not being vague.  You guys are telling me that you don't see any resemblance to your show to his show.  A resemblance?  Sure, it's a resemblance.  How about like an identical twin resembles his brother?  Hey, Bob.  Yeah?  I could bring up stuff that he flat out took from us.  Name one.  All right.  You'll never convince him.  No, no, it's not.  That's not true.  Remember the time Howard and the crew were wearing the pens until someone leaked?  Yeah.  Ant and I did that bit...  In Boston.  In Boston three days before he did. 
[00:18:30]  And we had all our listeners pound his fax machine yelling and screaming.  I know.  You guys listen to him probably as much as I do.  I'm just saying it.  It works both ways.  True.  You probably did.  You want to...  No, Anthony, I still hear you mention every show he does every day.  Now, honestly...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait, please...  Bob, please now listen to me for a second.  I will listen to you.  If you want to say that, I am not up until he's off the air.  I get up probably 9.30. 
[00:19:00]  I go right to the computer and start trading stocks.  Anthony, yesterday you mentioned stuff he said on his show.  Like what?  And I know you said it again today with the sea breeze.  Yesterday you mentioned him talking about California.  Now, you're not hearing the show where somebody's giving you a transcript of the show?  No, I'm hearing from other people around the station that go, what a fag, he's drinking sea breezes.  Sure.  I hear that, but no, I don't...  Bob, trust me when I tell you, I've known Anthony for a long time. 
[00:19:30]  The guy, it's not possible for Ed to get up there.  I'm not up.  I'm not up to listen.  I please understand.  It's not that you're not going to convince me.  Do people feed us a line or two around here that they might have heard him say?  Sure, of course.  I'm not going to lie.  But I haven't listened to his show in a very long time.  I checked him out right after he announced the whole separation thing, definitely.  That's right.  And I went on there and said it was some of the best radio he's done since like...  And I remember you saying that. 
[00:20:00]  Since like 88.  But I remember you saying that and saying that, oh, he needed higher ratings.  I remember you saying that.  Needed higher ratings?  No, you said it like this guy needs anything else to talk about.  He had such high ratings, now his ratings are even higher.  You don't compliment him.  I've complimented Howard enough and we're sick and tired of like hearing Howard cry about us.  So no one else can do radio in New York except Howard.  That's not true, but I'm saying you guys...  You know, it's like singing I Want to Hold Your Hand and saying you're roadie. 
[00:20:30]  You guys do exactly what he does.  It's not a fact.  I listen to you all the time.  Bob, you're delusional if you...  I'm not delusional.  No, listen to me.  I've listened to him my whole life.  Listen to me.  Let me get...  Exactly.  And that's why you think like it is.  I thought you were getting divorced because he got divorced.  Yeah, that's what it is.  I need it.  I'm really taking it a little far.  To tell you the truth, when he announced that he was being separated and no one knew before that,  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  At that point, I'd been out of my house for about two months. 
[00:21:00]  So, you were copying you?  Yeah, right.  No, the fact of the matter is, I didn't say anything.  And when he announced it, I'm like, great.  Now, if I do announce it, people are going to say, oh, yeah.  You're going to get him off.  I invented the voice, Robin.  I know.  Okay.  You remember you got on.  You were saying how Man Cow is stealing your stuff.  That's what Howard always said.  But Man Cow did.  He stole Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  Dude.  So, what?  Just because something really happens, we can't talk about it?  It killed the...  You're saying it needs that matter that he said. 
[00:21:30]  Bob, I'm going to hang up on you if you don't allow me to have a conversation with you.  I'm listening to you.  First of all, you're delusional if you think Howard was the first to do this type of radio.  He has all you guys brainwashed thinking that he invented all this stuff.  This shit...  Well, I almost cursed.  This crap has been going on a lot longer than Howard.  I used to drive in 83, 84 when he first came around.  I listened to radio morning, noon, and night.  I drove to 10 hours a day.  There were guys doing...  There was nobody around here doing it.  There were guys doing lesbian stuff before.  I promise you, I was fanning the radio. 
[00:22:00]  That's why I listen to you guys.  There were guys doing lesbian radio before Howard.  I know that's hard for you to swallow, but it's true.  If you want to do some research, look up Steve.  It's not that important to me.  It's just that it's very evident that you guys are doing exactly what he does.  You know, you should have all the facts, though.  You guys used to make fun of him with the lesbians, and now you have lesbians in there every day.  I never made fun of that.  You definitely didn't.  I heard it with my own ears.  I'm not hearing it.  Bob, with this guy's logic, though, it's like saying, oh, my God, look, look, one baseball player is ripping off another one because he goes out there and hits home runs. 
[00:22:30]  Well, but what I'm saying is one baseball player is copying another player's style when he crunches down like Joe Morgan.  That's what I'm saying.  You're taking an exact style.  Exact.  No difference.  That's not true.  That's your opinion.  You're going to tell me that.  You know, Bob, I don't even have to defend our show.  All I know is there's enough people out there that listen to us and know what the deal is, that we do come up with a ton of original stuff.  End of conversation.  I don't hear it.  End of conversation.  I don't hear it.  I don't hear it.  You don't hear it because you're one of the Howard guys, and that's fine. 
[00:23:00]  That's not true.  I laugh at a lot of things.  I hope our listeners defend us as much as you defend Howard.  I appreciate that, but it's not true.  It's not true.  There's tight stuff.  I've been hearing Howard do it.  There's tight stuff, and I say, Howard, did this.  Howard's made a career years and years of getting people to believe everything he says.  And when he says that people are ripping him off and he invented this and blah, blah, blah, people are going to buy it,  and you're one of those types of people that just step fast believe it. 
[00:23:30]  These guys hold up the signs, and it's, you know, and the people are going on.  How about, how about, that's all Stutter and John.  Dude, how about Butt Bongo Fiesta?  Yeah.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Remember Butt Bongo?  I remember it well.  Call Howard and ask him where he got the idea from.  Where he got the idea from?  Not us.  No, not us.  No, but see if he'll be honest with you.  But where did, I haven't got the idea from.  Ask him, ask him, ask him.  He's always busy when I call.  Ask him.  Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.  Ask him if he used to get tapes from Chicago and get copies of Steve Dahl's radio show. 
[00:24:00]  Just ask him.  We're honest on this radio show.  Ask him those two questions.  See if you get a real answer.  You won't.  I couldn't even get much with the guys.  You won't.  Listen, I don't believe you.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Yeah, I was listening to Stern the day that he heard about Butt Bongo Fiesta and said he wanted to do it on the air.  Yeah, it was two DJs up in Maine.  Yeah, I heard it the day he did that.  I remember that one because I was listening to him.  He was still funny.  And then he took it as his own and... 
[00:24:30]  This guy just said he acknowledged it and said, I want to do that.  Yeah, and he ripped it off.  Bob, and ripped it off.  And then after that, he made it his own.  That was it.  And now if anybody else does Butt Bongo Fiesta, he's going to sit there going, oh, I invented that, Robin.  Right.  There's one of your guys.  This guy hasn't been original since Kenneth and Tom.  You guys probably had balls enough to actually put me through.  I'll give you that.  You always hang up and say, oh, you can't curse, and I've never cursed.  No, because you come on and then you tell...  I know who you are.  You don't want to discuss.  You tell a story and then you jump in with a Baba Booey and Stern rolls. 
[00:25:00]  I've never been Baba Booey in my life.  And after a while, it gets stupid and boring, man.  No, but you're pouring it off and saying you're hung up because I curse because you want to look like you're honest.  And I've never cursed.  And you always say, oh, you can't curse, man.  Right or wrong?  Well, we let you through to disgusting because you don't want to talk.  But right or wrong?  Now you're disgusting.  Right or wrong is that what you're...  I would have to hear a tape.  I don't know.  Come on, man.  You know you're not doing it by...  I'll be honest.  We hang up on plenty of people and dump out of their curses on a daily basis.  I wouldn't call it a curse, so I wouldn't get on a radio. 
[00:25:30]  I call for the goof factor.  All right, Bob.  You know what?  You guys go ahead.  Keep copying.  I'll keep listening.  There's nothing else on the radio.  Well, thank you, Bob.  At least we got you as a listener.  That's true.  Okay.  Every day.  Hey, Bill.  With the train.  Bill, thank you.  No problem.  All right, man.  Bye.  There you go.  I don't know why we entertained that for as long as we did.  Whatever.  I know the faithful listeners know that we do enough original stuff on this show.  That's all that matters. 
[00:26:00]  I don't care.  We worked too hard to be labeled that, and, you know, Howard gets to say that in the paper  today, and we're told we can't say a word about it.  So unless you're on the air just sagging tunes or doing news or, I don't know, I guess that's it.  Unless you're sagging tunes or just a news broadcaster, you're ripping off Howard, right?  But the fact is we were thrown out of his press conference when we were trying to be team  players because the company told us to be team players.  So we figured we'd make the first move. 
[00:26:30]  I even tried to get into his birthday party.  Thought it would be cool just to hang.  Wasn't going to disrupt it.  We weren't allowed to do that either.  No.  So.  Keeping us at distance.  We definitely try to be team players.  We do work for the same company.  Yeah.  But it was a big deal that we were at his press conference yesterday.  Such a big deal.  What is he scared of?  I don't know.  We're not even in the same day part.  All right.  And back to the Smashing Pumpkins CD that I'm jamming on the way to work. 
[00:27:00]  We got a.  How many want to give away?  Like three?  All right.  We'll give the new Smashing Pumpkins CD, Machina, the Machine of God, to the 10th, 11th, and 12th callers right now at 212-757-1027.  We're going to regroup and we'll be back.  Stay there.  We'll be in Anthony.  We found a girl that can shoot stuff from a private area.  More stupidity on the way.  1027-WNEW.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Woo-hoo. 
[00:27:30]  There it goes.  This guy's very good over there.  He's after me.  I'll be show.  I like Anthony.  Did you like Anthony?  Anthony was good.  With Kinison and finally asking Jackie to do Vegas and Jackie turning him down because  there's not enough money.  I love Anthony.  You know, I forgot all about that.  Anthony tapped into something.  Do you remember that?  Didn't Kinison once ask you to play with him and you turn him down?  I like Anthony too.  Thank you, Opie.  Here's the Opie and Anthony show.  Our phone line is 212-757-1027.  What's the fax line? 
[00:28:00]  We got this big N.E.W. banner behind you because I guess Extra was supposed to be here today.  Interviewed the radio chick about the bra incident on Letterman with Kathy Lee Gifford.  Yeah.  It didn't show, huh?  Tax line 212-957-WNEW.  All right, let's go to Jim.  Jim, you're next on N.E.W.  What's going on, Jim? 
[00:28:30]  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  You told us to listen to that guy last night.  Which one?  Which show?  The one right after you.  Don and Mike?  Yeah.  And?  Not bad.  It's like a dysfunctional family.  Well, they just started.  You've got to give them time.  No, it's actually, hey, I listen to them over like us.  See, unlike other high-profile jocks in this city, we're going to try to support the people  we work with.  I tried to call in last night before and say what I learned, and I was going to tell 
[00:29:00]  you guys that I was, for the first time in a month and a half, not going to listen to  K-Rock at 7 o'clock.  Yeah, we don't want you listening to them anymore, because we finally found a show that might  work.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So we threw them a bone for a while when Lycus was still here, but Lycus is gone.  We have Don and Mike from Washington.  They follow us now, and I think you guys really should give them a chance before you trash  them.  Not bad.  Hey, real quick.  Give them at least three or four months.  Have you checked out Ron and Fez after Don and Mike?  No, I'm up at 4 a.m. every morning.  Well, did you check them out, Ron and Fez? 
[00:29:30]  No, because they go off at 4 and some other stupid thing comes on.  Oh, all right.  Hey, real quick.  Yeah.  Yesterday, talking to that chick with the Hummer thing.  Yes.  I found out the problem.  What?  He's paying for them.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Yeah, I lost you, man.  He's paying her to give them.  Everyone went right over your head.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Later.  We have short-term memory problems.  A little heavily medicated.  Sorry.  The one with the ball in her mouth that was giving them wrong, he wasn't enjoying them? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, the ball.  Yeah, okay.  Right.  That's why he's not enjoying them anymore.  All right.  You have to pay for them.  All right.  I got you.  Okay, bye.  Thank you, man.  We're moving on to new things today.  Please.  New things.  My God.  We can't keep track of what's going on here today.  We can't rehash stuff from yesterday.  No.  Except for the fact that we did have a great lesbian for a day at the end of the show yesterday.  Oh, right at the end of the show.  Fantastic.  We had the crappiest pictures.  Whoever was taking the pictures should be fired.  Really bad?  Horrible.  Because I quickly, you know, because I had something going for the, what was her name, 
[00:30:30]  Karen with the big, huge, young breasts.  They were nice and firm and stuff.  Yeah.  And so I quickly went online, you know, this morning to check out the pictures on the unofficial  website, and we got crappy pictures up there from last night's festivities.  What's wrong with them?  Why are they crappy?  Crappy quality or crappy poses?  I think we got pictures of their elbows.  Oh, really?  I'm serious.  There's one good shot, but you don't know what they look like.  You can't really appreciate the big, huge hooters. 
[00:31:00]  Mark's got the video.  Yeah, I've got the video.  Are you going to send the video to Steve?  Yeah, as soon as I can get it out to Steve.  All right.  That was great yesterday.  Yeah, because there's some great clips there, because we didn't think the girls were going  to go at it.  We had the lesbian couch in here.  There was no love connection.  The other girl, Galaxia, was all bummed out that Karen didn't really, you know, she really  wasn't into her.  And then out of nowhere, Karen just, like, takes her top down.  She's got the huge hooters, and she goes, look.  I'll let her do whatever she wants to me.  That was unbelievable.  Yeah.  Out of nowhere.  I thought that nothing was going to be happening. 
[00:31:30]  Score!  Yeah.  It was a score.  And then, like, Karen just laid on her back and allowed Galaxia to go to town.  Galaxia.  What kind of name is that?  Right?  It's Galaxia?  It's like that game you play in the arcade.  Yeah.  Isn't that a game?  Galaxia?  Yeah, that is, actually.  All right.  We got some guys outside that want to do something crazy for the show?  Dude, this one guy's got the most incredible hat I've ever seen in an entire world.  Are you going to be able to leave work today, Mark?  This is your day.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Yeah, I can get fired today. 
[00:32:00]  Huh?  Send him to TRL.  Want to go to TRL?  Oh, Madonna's on TRL today.  TRL.  Oh, that whore.  Oh, yeah.  We should get some wow.  These guys have the best sign.  That's the best wow I've ever seen.  All right, let's bring him in.  Let's bring him in.  What, he's got a hat or something, you're saying?  This hat lights up, like, get out of here.  Like Nagasaki.  Yeah, these guys, I guess, they're leaving or something, and they want to walk down.  Oh, you're kidding.  Oh, they're not here talking.  Put that hat on.  Look at this thing. 
[00:32:30]  This thing is great.  He's got a construction hat with the famous Opie and Anthony Wow sticker, and then on top  of it, he has to have, like, a three-foot sign that lights up.  That is the goddamn funniest thing.  Dude, you're going to walk down the street with that?  One of your bulbs are out.  You want to have, like, a...  All right, so what are you, electrician or Tim Nogger?  Yeah.  Oh, what do you do?  Exterminate it.  How is that lighting up?  Exterminate it.  I have too much time.  How is that lighting up, first of all? 
[00:33:00]  Got a little motorcycle battery there?  Yeah.  He's got it on the side of his body there.  All right.  Goddamn, if you get on a live shot with that thing, you'll be the king.  Why don't you guys, like, walk down Broadway toward TRL?  We'll have to, uh...  You got a cell phone, right?  Give us a call and see how far he makes it, because everyone's got to check out this sign.  It's hilarious.  This sign has to be on TV.  Are the other guys with you, or are they...  No, no, those guys they just saw up here when I came in.  Oh, all right.  And what's your name, man?  Larry.  Larry.  And why do you want to do this, Larry? 
[00:33:30]  Just for the hell of it?  Yeah, just for the hell of it.  And we'll throw you some prizes and stuff.  Oh, we'll completely take care of you.  I mean, Jesus Christ, if that gets on TV, I will laugh my ass off.  It's a construction hat with the WOW sticker, and then just a huge, what, about three-foot  WOW sign?  Yes.  That lights up.  A little pole on it.  Three foot by one foot.  And, like, the pole's about, I don't know, eight to ten inches.  Yeah.  And the letters are well over a foot high.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Yeah, turn that on so you can get a picture for the underground website.  Look at that thing. 
[00:34:00]  Put it on your head, too.  That'll make a good picture.  Looks like the sign from Caroline, you know?  Awesome.  That's great.  Mark, can you kill a little time and go down there with them, or what?  Big lit up WOW.  Do you want to see if more people want to show up this afternoon?  We can have, like, a posse.  Big WOW-age.  We'll wait a few minutes.  Yeah, you want to start at, how about we just get people in the area?  We start at 4 o'clock.  Yep.  4 o'clock, where are you going to be?  Right downstairs, in front of the Brooklyn Diner.  At 57th and 7th.  Yep.  In front of the Brooklyn Diner. 
[00:34:30]  We'll just go for a little walk.  All right.  And then we'll just take a little, we'll make a little WOW parade down at TRL today.  That's a great, great WOW show.  That's hilarious.  It is so funny how it lights up.  All right, so at 4 o'clock, in front of the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th, if you want  to join Psycho Mark and this crazy mofo.  Who are the other guys out there?  Some other guys that came down, you talked to them yesterday, and said they want to come  down and go down and hang out with Mark today at TRL, so they're here as well.  Yeah, bring them in.  Were they the ones that WOWed on TV last night? 
[00:35:00]  Dudes, what's up?  Were you the one on TV last night?  No.  Oh, because that sign looks familiar.  Wow.  What's your name, man?  I'm Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Lad.  Lad?  And who's the other dude?  Hey, Kerry.  What's up?  Do you guys want to go down to TRL with that huge WOW sign?  Yeah.  We're going to do like a little WOW parade.  We're going to start it at 4 o'clock outside the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th.  We should see if we can get some girls, too, you know?  Yeah, we need a couple girls to show up.  Some authentic WOWing going on. 
[00:35:30]  I know this is last minute, but we can pull this off.  4 o'clock, we'll be outside.  Oh, I invented WOW.  That rocks.  I invented parades.  All right.  And then after you guys do this and go down to MTV and have some fun, come back to the  station.  We'll hook you guys up with some good stuff, all right?  Thanks.  All right, man.  Where are you guys from, by the way?  Jersey.  Jersey?  Cool.  We like Jersey.  Long Island.  Long Island, yeah.  What bar, man?  Port Jeff area?  Sure.  Sure.  I've hung out in Port Jeff a ton.  Yeah.  In the summertime. 
[00:36:00]  Actually, I do work for, I think you guys show up at the Greenland Fire Department fair  sometimes?  Oh, yes.  We do the Greenland Fire Department fair.  We do that every year?  Yep.  I do work for them.  Oh, good deal.  All right.  We'll see you guys outside at 4 o'clock.  Thanks for stopping by.  Thanks, dude.  All right.  Goddamn, is that funny?  It's really funny.  It's the best WOW sign I've ever seen.  I can't wait to see that on TV.  Hey, Mike.  What's going on?  How are you?  What's up, man?  How are you?  All right, man.  Good.  Listen, I wanted to talk to you about Don and Mike. 
[00:36:30]  I used to listen to those guys down in Washington.  I used to drive down there.  Yeah.  Those guys are pretty good, man.  You know?  I mean, you know, for 7 o'clock run, you know?  Yeah.  They're on after us here in New York, and yeah, we're going to give them a chance, you  know?  Yeah.  I'm sorry, man.  They're definitely worth listening to, you know?  I mean, that's like the best radio that they have down there in Washington.  Virginia, man.  I mean, the only thing that they got is, you know, Howard in the morning, and then you  got to wait until 7 o'clock at night before.  Actually, they're on at 2 o'clock down there. 
[00:37:00]  You got to get them at 2 o'clock.  Well, that's the only thing that goes on.  I like them a lot better than Likas, so.  Yeah, Likas really sucks, man.  And we really got to start supporting some more shows around here, and we're going to  be screwed.  Listen, let me ask you a question, man.  Don't come you off.  I just want to ask you seriously.  Look.  Yeah.  I'm not going to curse nothing, but.  Dude, you guys are going to get us in so much trouble.  No, no, no.  We've really got to move on.  Go.  Look, I'm not going to say nothing.  Go.  What I'm saying is that you guys say, I mean, you guys are good.  I'm a good fan.  You know, I listen to you guys all the time.  You're not going down in the mornings, but if you did, I know you guys are team players, 
[00:37:30]  you know, you're on the same cup, being everything, but if you guys went in the mornings, do you  actually think that you would, you know, beat Howard?  I'm not going in the mornings.  I know you're not going in the mornings, but I'm saying, if you guys did go to the mornings,  do you actually think that you would, you know, match up against Howard's Raiders?  Mike, let me tell you the guys on the truth, and Sophie speaking, okay?  I would love to go to mornings and see what we could do.  I mean, you guys are good, man.  I'm just saying, I'm a competitive person, and I would love to see, you know, what we 
[00:38:00]  could do against them, sure.  That's my God's honest answer.  Will it happen?  I don't think so.  I like you guys, man.  I think you guys are good.  I mean, I'm not putting you guys down at all, you know, don't get me wrong.  I'm not afraid to go up against them.  I think I want to see, you know, how good we are.  You know, might as well go up against the best in New York.  Well, that's true.  But it's not going to happen.  I know that.  You guys get good ratings in the afternoons.  You think you'd get them in the morning.  That's all I'm saying.  I mean, isn't that where the most radio is, is in the morning? 
[00:38:30]  Mike, it would be a bear.  It would take a long time.  Especially working for the same company.  Right.  I know.  Then we wouldn't be able to compete the way we would want to.  I would love to give it a shot.  Could we win?  Of course.  I think we could win, sure.  Why don't you guys move to K-Rock?  Then you guys will have a real radio station.  They dumped us.  You guys weren't on K-Rock.  That's just another story for another day.  K-Rock could have had us, and then they didn't want us. 
[00:39:00]  That would be better than, what's his name, at 2 o'clock, that's for sure.  I don't even know who's on against us anymore.  All right, Mike, thank you.  Thanks.  All right, bye.  Bye.  You guys, you've got to move on from this.  Yeah, we're done with that.  If we do all live phones, you're just going to get us screwed.  So please move on.  I think we've spent enough time on it.  Yeah.  Adam, what's going on?  O&A.  Yay.  How's it going?  Good.  Good.  Radio chick O&A and Don and Mike.  That's some quality radio there, guys. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know them last night?  Yeah.  They were great.  They were hysterical.  They had me rolling.  Well, that's what we want, you know?  Yeah, no.  But that's good stuff.  Well, cool.  I'm glad you like it so far.  And I think if they keep the lineup exactly how it is, radio chick and then you guys and  then Don and Mike, that's just ratings galore right there.  Well, we believe so.  We will see.  We definitely believe so.  Okay.  You guys suck. 
[00:40:00]  All right.  Thanks, Adam.  All right.  Bye.  I mean, the deal is Ant and I are nearing two years in New York.  Yep.  Let me just get this out of the way, okay?  We really need to start supporting the other shows here at NAW or at least giving them  a chance.  There hasn't been anything worth supporting for a while.  No.  For the last two years, Ant and I have worked for a station that is still in last place.  Yeah.  Dead last.  Dead freaking last.  We're doing well.  Thank you.  Ant and I consistently do three times the ratings of any other show on this station. 
[00:40:30]  That's a fact.  We are number one in all the key demos in Afternoon Drive.  And that's a fact.  Yes.  Okay?  The problem is that's not good enough to keep a station going.  No.  If this station continues to be in last place, there's going to be a major problem.  Yeah.  They'll do something.  Something drastic that won't include Ant and I.  So we have to support the new shows and give them a chance, okay?  Ant and I only have a little over a year left in our contract. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Let me say it right now.  A year from now, if this station's in last, I have no desire to re-up.  Nope.  No desire whatsoever.  Do we want to stay in New York?  Do we want to stay at NAW?  Yes.  But, oh, my God.  Could you imagine having to sign on to the station in last place again?  Oh, when we got here, all the stories we heard of how great it was going to be in a matter of months.  Right.  And to be honest with you, you know, a year from now, if the station is still in last, I don't think the company's going to put up with it. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  Mm-hmm.  So it's kind of like we're up to do or die.  I mean, a year goes by like that, you know?  So we are going to support all the new shows.  We really like the radio chick now.  She has proven herself, you know?  And we're going to give the other shows a chance, and then we'll see what happens.  Yeah, but we're not going to right off the bat trash anyone?  We'll give them a chance.  If they suck, you know, you'll know it.  We'll know it. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, we're not going to make believe.  Yeah, we don't fake it.  We're not going to make believe it's a great show, you know?  Come on.  Why couldn't you do that for me?  When it's obviously a bad show.  I'm gone.  But we're going to give them a solid three or four months before we make any opinions.  That's a definite.  Yeah.  You know?  All right, let's move on.  Let's go to Andy.  Andy, you're next on NAW.  What's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Tom Green last night.  And the Lewinsky thing?  It was so good.  You liked it, huh? 
[00:42:30]  It was...  I thought they...  I don't know.  There were a lot of funny things going on.  I want to thank Tom Green for calling our show yesterday.  That was pretty cool.  I just liked it.  I mean, it was a little different, obviously, than the rest of his shows.  Right.  But they built it up.  They took an entire town.  They played with them for an entire week.  And the big announcement was handbags.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They went to...  If you didn't watch last night, I'm sure, knowing MTV, they'll run it another ten times  in the next month.  But Tom Green took Lewinsky back to his hometown in Vancouver. 
[00:43:00]  And then they created a media frenzy saying they had a huge announcement.  And the announcement was something really, really stupid about, what, Vancouver being the  fabric capital of the universe or something?  Yeah.  Ottawa.  Something like that.  And then they showed, like, a couple handbags they made out of, like, Tom Green's, like,  parents' bedspread.  You just got to look the way, though, that they had the media following them around for  a week.  Yeah.  It was pretty good.  For three days.  All right.  Well, three days.  The best part of the show was when Tom Green, he does a lot. 
[00:43:30]  He goes and wakes up his parents at four in the morning.  Yeah.  And his father wakes up and goes, oh, oh, Monica, hi.  Just completely, like, surprises him with Monica Lewinsky in the middle of the night.  It was pretty funny.  She had her hob as nob.  That's what we said to Tom yesterday.  She didn't look bad.  Really?  How's she looking?  I didn't see her.  Neck down.  Neck down.  Neck down?  No, I think her face is not bad.  Is she still plump?  Yeah, she's still a little chubby.  She depends on what angle you're looking at. 
[00:44:00]  She seems to have a really nice personality, though.  She was very bubbly.  Yeah.  I think if Tom Green could get her on his show, that we could get Monica on our show.  You should.  I think if we played our cards right, I think she would come on the show.  Let's try to get that together.  I'm serious.  Can you get her on the couch?  Get her on the couch.  Monica.  At least we should talk to her on the phone or something.  Yeah.  Because she had a really cool personality.  We'll get her on.  I think we will.  But, yeah, MTV will be running it again, and it definitely was a pretty good Tom Green show last night. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Hey, one other question for you guys.  Yeah.  Have you ever seen a show on the Food Network called The Iron Chef?  No.  Well, I want to talk about it.  It's Friday night's most intense show on TV.  It's a Japanese overdub show in English that treats cooking like a sport.  Cool.  Really?  Yes.  I can't deal with the Food Network.  No, this isn't Food Network.  It could be on ESPN.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  I'll look for it.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you, Andy. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  All right, man.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.  We'll be back with more of your phone calls in just a bit.  Hey, New York.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF, and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio,  Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  Thank you, Vince.  Yeah.  Where's Vince McMahon?  CBS is trying to, what, get smacked out on CBS?  Oh, yeah?  That was in the business section of the paper today, right?  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  You know, Linda McMahon, Vince's wife, is the one that's in charge of the whole frigging  shebang?  She is truly the CEO of the company, and she's really the one that deals with the stockholders  and everything.  Isn't that something?  And what does Vince do then?  He's like a figurehead.  He's the PR guy, you know?  Yeah.  He goes out and shakes her hands, and she's like the brains.  That's about that.  So what's the deal?  I mean, CBS just wants to get Smackdown on Channel 2 or whatever? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Smackdown's on what?  Channel 9 now?  8 p.m.?  Yeah.  Yeah, they want to get it on CBS.  That would be huge for the WWF.  Yeah.  Huge.  Yes.  And they reported earnings, Anthony?  Yeah, they did pretty good.  WWF did well?  Yeah.  Not bad.  It could be a buy there.  Can we be stock analysts?  I don't think we can.  Oh, really?  I don't own any.  Especially Ixnay. 
[00:46:30]  I'm not saying anything.  We're just talking about stocks.  Yeah.  All right, let's go.  Who is it?  Whoa.  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  What's your name?  Oh, my goodness.  Hi, my goodness.  How are you?  I didn't know I was on.  You startled me with the ringing of the phone when I picked you up.  Yeah, I was dialing on my other phone to make a phone call.  Oh, it's Opie and Anthony, and you are live on our show.  Okay, I'm just calling in to ring into my boyfriend, Rich, who was initiated into the 
[00:47:00]  Hummer Tuesday Club yesterday.  Or Tuesday Hummer Club.  Either way.  Tuesday Hummer Club.  All right.  And he wanted me to do this for him.  To what?  To hob his knob or to call the radio show?  To call in and let you guys know that he was initiated.  Oh, right on.  What's his name?  Rich.  And where does he work?  He works for Keyspan Energy.  So now everyone there knows he got a Hummer last night from you.  Yes, they do.  Well, thank you for supporting the radio show and hobbing his knob. 
[00:47:30]  Anytime.  How was it?  Was it all right?  Well, I didn't get a that a girl.  Oh, really?  Well, because it went a little too far into excitement and got turned into something else.  Oh, I got you.  Oh, some sex.  Yeah.  Some all out.  Yeah.  Sweaty sex.  Yeah.  That's where those Hummers usually end up.  Yeah.  Well, nothing wrong with that.  Nothing at all.  All right.  Well, thanks for sharing today.  No problem. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  Bye.  Have a good one.  Thanks.  Let's go to Sue.  Sue has a problem with something associated with our radio show.  Sue, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I'm waiting forever.  Okay, listen.  You guys have the, what is it, official or unofficial girl?  The O.P. and Anthony girl?  The unofficial website is doing the girls of O&A.  Yeah, there's a section on the website.  Okay, no, I already, well, I saw it.  Do you know that one of them is a prostitute?  All right.  An extra added treat, I would figure. 
[00:48:30]  No, I am dead serious.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let's take this a little slow.  Okay, go ahead.  I want to get everyone up to speed.  The unofficial O.P. and Anthony website, www.foundrymusic.com, has the girls of O&A section where we encourage, you know, the ladies of our show to send in some raunchy pictures of the food.  And then the listeners kind of vote on who the hottest girl is, and then they win stuff, I guess.  Yeah.  Not really associated with our show officially, but.  That's why it's unofficial.  Yeah, that's why, but Steve, but Steve's doing it, and he's doing a great job with that. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Now, you're saying that one of the girls up there now is a prostitute.  Yes.  Now, how do you know this?  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Well, no, not allegedly.  No, this is for sure, and I can back up what I say.  Well, how do you know?  I know this girl, the triple nipple, okay?  All right, but don't say her name now.  No, I'm not going to say her name.  Okay, now, how do you first define prostitute?  Okay, well, getting paid for sex.  Yeah, like for real sex? 
[00:49:30]  Yes, constantly, every day.  This girl is rich in the sex.  I'm serious.  Oh, yeah?  I'm dead serious.  How do you know, though?  Because I was actually friends with her.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And she introduced me to the lady she works for.  Okay.  And the lady had offered me, and I said no, and she actually asked me to drive her somewhere,  which I did, and one of the guys just happened to be, I swear to God, I know half the guys, 
[00:50:00]  these guys are, like, bad.  All right.  I mean, you guys would know who I'm talking about.  I just think that.  So you have a problem with that.  Why?  I have a problem, because if she's going to represent you guys on the unofficial site, it's wrong.  All right.  For somebody to represent you like that.  First of all, until we hear from her, I'm not believing what you say. 
[00:50:30]  I don't know who you are or what agenda you might have against certain people.  I can completely back up everything I said.  All right.  Hold on, Steve from the unofficial website is on the line.  He wants to comment about your charges.  Let's go to our buddy, Steve.  Steve.  I thought we were having fun.  What's up, Steve?  What happened?  What happened?  Uh-oh.  You're on the line with Sue.  Uh, Sue?  Hi.  Have you got evidence to substantiate your claims here? 
[00:51:00]  Oh, yes, I do.  Yeah, how can you back this up?  Yeah, I mean, we need, like, concrete.  How?  I can give you concrete evidence.  How?  How?  What kind of evidence?  Well, I can't say it on the air, but I can get it for you.  What?  Pictures?  What?  Pictures?  People?  Well, see, you know, I am so, look, I know the service that she works for.  She's on, okay, she actually.  Don't give too much info away, please, Sue. 
[00:51:30]  Okay, I won't.  And who cares?  Well, yeah.  Okay, you guys don't care?  Well.  You don't care about if there's a prostitute up there?  Ultimately, we kind of discourage that kind of behavior, but.  Well, come on, guys.  You guys are bad in that.  No.  Ultimately, it's not the hookers of Opie and Anthony, but, you know.  Well, you know, she's going to represent your site, you know.  Would she have the knob of one of our listeners, you think?  Anytime.  For a price.  Anywhere, any day.  Yeah, maybe you could spin this into something. 
[00:52:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, we can.  She was on K-Lock also, and he totally bested her, too.  All right.  She gets on every radio station that she can.  Information that only you guys would know if I wasn't on the air.  And, Sue, why are you associating with whores, then?  I don't associate with her anymore.  You drove her to some appointments.  I went with her.  Ah, look at you.  No, no, no.  I didn't do anything.  I said no.  Yeah, sure.  No, I am not.  I am not.  You met her boss.  What?  You met her boss.  Yeah, I met her boss. 
[00:52:30]  So why would you agree to meet with, let's just call her a madam?  Why would you agree to meet with a madam?  Okay.  If you knew she was a madam.  Wait, first of all, no, no.  First of all, I didn't agree to meet with her.  We went over to this lady's house, okay, and she introduced me and then started talking  about it.  I actually didn't know ahead of time until we got there.  Oh.  How much did she offer you?  What was it? 
[00:53:00]  She takes 50 and the girls take 150.  For what?  For coming out on calls.  How much time do you get for that?  What do you have to do?  An hour.  An hour?  Is it an hour of anything?  Like I could suggest a butt?  Anything.  You know, you name it, you got it.  She does all.  And you didn't go for it?  They have a website.  Seems like you can make a lot of money, Sue.  Well, she's the one who's making the money, not me, because I choose not to do it, because 
[00:53:30]  I do have some respect for myself.  Did you think about doing it?  Absolutely not.  No, huh?  No, absolutely not.  All right.  How much would it take?  I wouldn't do it on nothing.  I wouldn't take it.  I wouldn't do it.  Nothing freebie?  No, no, no.  Really?  I'd take that back.  I wouldn't do it on.  You'd not be that good.  All right.  Hold on.  Becky wants to verify Sue's story.  Let's bring Becky.  It's like a party line.  Yeah.  Oh, Becky.  Becky.  Ba-ba-boo-ee.  Well.  Wrong line. 
[00:54:00]  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  I got to do this.  You made us screw the phones up.  All right.  Steve, so what are you thinking?  You know something?  How does this chick, you know, what reason does she have for calling you guys up and saying  stuff like this?  Yeah.  Why are you mad at this girl, Sue, that you would call her out like this?  I'm not mad at the girl.  No, I'm kind of upset with you guys because you're letting somebody, I mean, I can't. 
[00:54:30]  We can't have background checks on everyone that is associated with this show.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I mean, I'm letting you in on it.  I know.  And our listeners all want to know how they could hire this girl for an hour.  I swear to God.  You want the website?  No, we don't want the website.  Well, I'm just telling you.  I just, you know, you guys are too good for that.  At least I think that.  Is there a picture on the website as being like a prostitute?  Actually, okay, it's, um. 
[00:55:00]  There's prostitute websites now?  No, it's a stripper site.  Oh.  That's their cover site.  Well, wait a minute.  You just called her a prostitute five minutes ago.  Yeah.  Well, it's a stripper site, but that's the cover-up.  All right.  The cover-up.  They're in the yellow pages.  All right.  Well, Sue, thanks for bringing this to our attention.  One of the girls associated with the girls of O&A is a prostitute.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  So.  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  Just wanted to let you guys know. 
[00:55:30]  All right.  Well, we appreciate the information, Sue.  All right.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay, so now.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  So, Steve, how are you today?  Uh, it was great.  Yeah?  No, you know something?  Um, I, uh, you know, I'm generally a pretty cynical guy, so until I see a whole pile of proof,  I'm really inclined not to believe Sue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, who, you know, who knows?  Maybe she's friends with one of the other chicks who's, you know, who's...  We're just not getting a lot of girls emailing their pictures, uh, for that section. 
[00:56:00]  No, no.  You know something?  There's actually a whole bunch, um, a whole bunch waiting in the wings.  I had to verify with Anthony that he wanted to, uh, pay for another vacation.  Wow.  I guess this week, this, this month we're giving one away to Las Vegas and...  Limo, Anthony, Opie, not me.  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, sorry, not, not, not you.  Uh, I pay for enough vacations.  Um, now they, um, I just wanted to make sure with him he was going to do it, so, uh, the  next vacation that Anthony from Top Notch Limo pays for is going to go to Florida, I think. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, really?  And you have a girl standing by and you're going to put their pictures up soon?  Yeah, there's going to be three more.  But what happened was, like, the voting was all messed up.  I had this poll set up, but I guess people were going back and voting, like, 150 times.  Ah, yeah.  So if you added up all the votes, you would add up to, like, 40,000, so...  Yeah, all right.  I had to reset it this morning.  Okay.  But, um, now, you know something?  Until I see a whole pile of proof, I really am inclined not to believe Sue.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, Steve.  You're doing a fine job with that website. 
[00:57:00]  Yes.  Um, I was thinking about coming in tomorrow to pick up all the tapes and to give Mark back his existing  ones.  Yeah, because you got some horrible shots of the lesbian for a day from yesterday.  I'm sorry I missed that when it goes on, you know?  No, I know.  You didn't take those pictures, you know?  You worked with what you were given, but Mark's got some great video from yesterday's festivities,  and we want to share with everybody, so...  Oh, I'm sure you do.  So come on by for that tomorrow.  Okay.  All right.  There's Steve from the unofficial Opie and Anthony website, www.foundrymusic.com. 
[00:57:30]  All right, Steve?  See you guys soon.  All right, cool.  Later.  Before we take a break, we've got to go to Camille.  Camille is outside TRL wowing.  Camille, what's going on?  Me and my friend came down from upstate.  We're wowing TRL.  Have you made it on TV yet?  Um, the TV shot at us a few times.  I think we have.  Your actual naked boobies.  Camille.  Hello?  Excuse me.  Yeah, Camille.  Hello?  I'm sorry.  I'm on a pay phone.  All right, throw...  We're coming down.  We'd like to come down to the station today.  Thank you for using me.  Well, throw a quarter in, man. 
[00:58:00]  That I can do.  That I can do.  Maybe they should wait for a psychomark and a psychopath.  That's what I'm going to tell them.  We'll see you guys later on.  Hey, Camille, we've got a bunch of people from the station coming down with huge wow signs.  You'll know who they are.  Find them, okay?  And they'll bring you back to the station after you wow.  No doubt.  All right, bye.  Take it easy, guys.  You guys suck.  All right, bye, Camille.  All right, Anthony, the wow parade is about ready to leave the station.  Yes.  We have psychomark.  A bunch of psychopaths have shown up. 
[00:58:30]  One guy has this huge wow sign that lights up on his head.  Yeah, it's got like a helmet and a big metal wow with lights in it and everything.  It lights up wow.  You ready to leave, psychomark?  Yeah, did that girl just say she's wowing down at TRL?  Yeah, I told her to look for you.  You're going to be outside the Brooklyn Diner, 57th and 7th, like right now.  You're leaving, right?  Right downstairs.  And then you guys are going to march before TRL is over.  So call us when you hit the street, Mark.  All right.  We'll check in with psychomark next.  Stay there.  Opie.  Keep your hands away from your pants. 
[00:59:00]  Ah, that's who I said.  And Anthony.  Ah, I'm just a point of fact.  More stupid to be on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  Is this the best way you guys can come up with?  1027 WNEW.  Lots going on on the show today.  Psychomark has left the building with some psychopaths.  They're going to cause trouble somewhere on live TV, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  We're hoping Psychomark checks in in a little bit here. 
[00:59:30]  They're going to be heading down to the MTV Studios.  There's a bunch of people down there.  Yeah.  They should be outside on 57th and 7th right now.  Right outside the Brooklyn Diner.  The one guy has a huge wow sign attached to a construction hat.  Yeah, like a hard hat.  A hard hat, excuse me.  A big sheet metal wow with lights in it.  Looks pretty cool.  Really lights up, right?  This could be him, but, uh, Spaz, you gotta... 
[01:00:00]  God damn it.  It could be Psychomark on the line.  Spaz decided to let the retard answer the phones for him.  I guess not.  Who is it?  What's a what?  Oh, really?  Why are they calling on the special line?  We have a...  God damn it. 
[01:00:30]  We have a bunch of retards that still listen, uh, that still work here.  I know.  We have...  No one's even going to understand, but...  We have people that...  All you have to do, I'm telling you, is just show up to the show, say, hey, I'm here to  see Opie and Anthony.  You can be a psychopath.  It doesn't matter.  Oh, my God.  And they allow you to come right down to the station, you know, to the studio.  And, and, and they're giving away the hotline that's really important to our radio show.  It's just people that want to call in with stupid crap.  Here, here, you want to get a hold of them?  You know, call this number. 
[01:01:00]  Why are they doing that?  Because they're stupid and they're retarded.  Oh, boy.  Why would you give out the special phone numbers for a radio show?  Those are the numbers like Jay Moore uses and celebrities and stuff, you know?  Hmm.  See, they're out on the street.  Psychomark.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Where are you?  The crowd is growing.  We're walking down Broadway right now.  We're at Broadway and 56.  Yeah.  And we've got a bunch of people walking around us. 
[01:01:30]  It's very crazy.  Looks like they're protesting, processing.  People don't even know what we're doing.  They are looking at us.  Is that one guy wearing his big huge?  Hey, he's just a hotline.  Hold on.  I'm going to take a quick look.  Holy God.  Yeah, they're walking down.  We only saw them for a second out the window.  How many people are with you, Mark?  Right now, we've got about 15 guys with us.  Okay.  And we're, actually, it's growing.  As we're walking down the street, people are joining us. 
[01:02:00]  I'm kind of like the Pied Piper here.  Oh, very nice.  Now, where are you right now?  Right now, we're at 55th and Broadway.  Okay.  So we're almost by the Letterman Theater.  All right.  And we'll be moving our way right down to TRL.  And we're going to aggravate the piss out of MTV again.  All right.  Hold on one sec.  Why is that line still?  Why is he still talking to that person?  Thank you.  See, now, you know, I swear to God, I just want to walk and go home today. 
[01:02:30]  No one cares around here.  They're giving out our special phone number to anyone.  It just keeps ringing because some retard upstairs is giving everyone the number.  Who gave them the number?  Hey, Mark.  Sorry.  Who's giving out the number?  The retard upstairs.  You're kidding me.  Oh!  There's people beeping on the street.  This is great.  Good.  How many more people have joined you, man?  Well, right now, I'm up to about, I say almost 20 people right now.  All right.  And you're on Broadway and what side street's there? 
[01:03:00]  Now we're down to 54th.  54th and Broadway.  Hold on.  Spaz's got an explanation for me.  Hold on.  Yes, Spaz.  Virginia, the receptionist upstairs is pissed that you're calling her a retard and she wants  to talk to you.  Receptionist, I've saved your butt a lot of times.  Hello.  Because you bring a lot of wax.  I officially call you a retard because you just gave out the phone number to everyone.  You're live on the show, you idiot.  I didn't give it out to anyone.  You just said the number.  We had to dump out. 
[01:03:30]  Who did I give it to?  That's a definition of a retard.  First of all, first of all, do not give that phone number to anybody.  No.  This call stood out in the lobby.  All right.  Well, take it down.  Why should I?  I didn't put it there.  My job is to sit here at the front desk.  Right.  And I try to make it as nice and smooth for people to come downstairs.  If you guys don't come up and take care of the people that are up in the lobby, you're  going to have problems.  And if the phone is listed outside, you're going to have the whole world calling. 
[01:04:00]  Well, who?  And I'm not a retard.  Who?  And I don't like anyone calling me a retard.  First of all.  I happen to be a very good receptionist.  And I've been here a lot longer than you guys have.  Whatever.  So I don't ever do that before.  Thank you.  Bye.  Hey, how did a computer get stolen from a...  Hello?  Ah, she hung up.  Retard.  Did somebody let somebody in the building and they actually stole a computer right out  of the...  First of all, I didn't call her a retard by name. 
[01:04:30]  I was assuming that it was someone else taking her place, but she does let a lot of stupid  people down to this floor.  Oh.  This is what we have to deal with.  Oh, boy.  Mark.  Yeah?  Hey, what's up?  We just lost her.  There's Earl.  What's he doing?  He's recording.  Everyone is.  We're having fun.  More people are joining us, and we've got people driving by. 
[01:05:00]  This is great.  We've got people joining us every week.  We've got a way out and keep in trouble.  We're waiting to see you guys show up on the TV screen.  We're down by 50 seconds right now in Broadway, so if you care to join us.  You can't miss us.  We've got about 12 huge signs.  We're walking around like, as if Diallo just got shot again.  Oh, my God.  You're doing your own little protest, right?  What's that?  You're doing your own little protest. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, right.  All right.  How many blocks away are you?  You've got to be close at this point.  We're real close.  We're about four blocks away right now.  All right.  Well, why is everyone screaming?  I think it's just like a party atmosphere, Elpy.  You can tell.  They're freaking out.  It's not a mistake.  All right, Mark.  I think we're losing your signal.  It's a massive atmosphere.  All right.  So we suggest people meet you down there at TRL, huh?  I'll check back in as soon as we're outside. 
[01:06:00]  Okay.  See you later.  Thank you.  So now we've got people mad at us upstairs, it seems like, Elpy.  Well, I will be talking to someone about it in a professional manner.  There are a lot of people that get through our tight security, Anthony.  Well, the security is obviously a joke, and that is based on past experience.  Security at this place blows. 
[01:06:30]  We had lawyers trying to serve us papers, and we told everyone, you know, don't let anyone in.  And sure enough, we walk outside to get coffee, and we're being served with papers.  They can't even do that right.  Yeah.  And there are people, and I didn't point anyone out up there, Virginia, that allow people to come down here,  that give out our special phone numbers.  Yeah.  We have two or three special phone numbers for, like, you know, very important people of the radio show. 
[01:07:00]  Like, if Jay Moore wants to call in, he could call this number, and it's guaranteed it's going to be free.  Right.  But there are people up there, and I didn't name them by name, that give out all these numbers.  Yeah.  And there are people that do work the front desk that just allow anyone downstairs.  Remember the wallet that got stolen out of here?  And then, you know what they do?  Then they make our life a living hell, a pain in the ass.  Like, what happened? 
[01:07:30]  Somebody walked in, just walked in one of the doors, and stole someone's wallet or something, or a pocketbook,  and just walked right out.  Walked in, walked out.  What did they do?  They battened down the hatches and wouldn't give us the codes to the doors.  So, oh, don't let Opie and Anthony in, but anybody else, any kook that wants to just mosey down the stairs, feel free.  Oh, my God.  What a mess. 
[01:08:00]  And why is any of our phone numbers posted outside the door of the station up there?  It should just be the request line, that's all.  No, it's our special line.  So now we've got to get all new special lines.  Hello, brother.  And I've got a receptionist yelling at me.  Hey, she's been here longer than us.  That's what it takes.  Remember when we used to hear that?  Yeah.  From everybody? 
[01:08:30]  All the old-timers try to pull that on us all the time.  Been here longer.  That's the prerequisite.  Receptionist for, what, 20, 30 years?  Good.  Got some serious career goals there.  It's nice.  Good to say.  Oh, boy.  What's fast?  People want to apply for the receptionist job.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  We'll look into that, maybe.  A receptionist yelling at us.  That's good.  I love this company.  Thank you.  All right, Mike, you're next.  What's going on, man?  I just listened to TRL, and they said that they're going to let a fan from outside interview Madonna.  Oh, really?  Yeah, so if one of the WoW posse get on.  Yeah, I don't see that happening.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  All right, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  I think they're going to be very, very aware of the WoW people when they show up.  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I'm in an Astro van.  I'm walking right next to the guys that are getting ready to WoW TRL, and my van's totally  open, and if they get into trouble, they can bail out.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Waiting for them.  Following them right now.  They're not making do it about just hanging out.  You're right behind them?  I'm right with them.  I'm walking right next to them.  All right.  How many people?  Hey, I'll have them screen for you.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  I got them on the line.  Screen. 
[01:10:00]  All right.  Wow, the little parade is growing.  Did you get that?  There's about 15, 20 guys out there right now.  How close are they, Tony?  We're right here at the...  Yeah, because they just went live.  They're live right now.  Yeah, we're 46th and Broadway.  You're just about there.  All right.  Tell Mark to call me back, okay?  All right.  No problem.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, you're next on N.E.W.  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  Pretty good.  Just watching a little TRL here. 
[01:10:30]  Still haven't seen any boobage.  Right.  We're waiting to see Psycho Mark.  He's just about there.  He should be calling in any second.  All right.  Cool.  And, hey, just think, at least the receptionist isn't letting Patty downstairs anymore.  Sorry I had to bring that up.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  I want to see the big lit-up wow sign on the guy's head on TV.  Hey, Mark.  What's going on?  Oh, we're at 46th and Broadway, and the window is in sight.  Yes. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, we're coming right down the street, and we're going to, you know, do our best to wow  that nasty boobage.  Okay.  So, we're making our way right now in the middle of the, what's it called here?  The middle of the middle of the street.  A bunch of get hit by a bunch of boxes.  Yeah, don't get hit.  So, we're going to try and set ourselves up in the middle of the street.  But there's tons of people down here.  It's crazy.  Yeah, they're live right now.  I noticed that.  We're coming to now. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We're coming to now.  All right.  We're coming to now.  Oh, my God.  I don't see you guys yet.  You're right there, right, Mark?  Yeah, I'm right outside right now.  Oh, I see you.  It was a quick shot at you.  I saw the big sign.  There it is, right there.  All right.  Right there.  The whole wow parade is right in the middle of Carson Daly and Madonna.  Wow, there's the big geared sign. 
[01:12:00]  Okay, very good.  Oh, there's a chick over here.  It's a big wow sign.  They were right behind Madonna's butt.  A big wow sign.  Oh, I want to try.  Hey, Mark, how many signs are out there, man?  What's up?  How many signs are out there?  We got a bunch of signs, as a matter of fact.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got a bunch of crazy signs.  All right.  You're not standing out here.  All right, not standing right here. 
[01:12:30]  You ran back here to stand in the middle.  I just want to go across the street.  That's all.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  They're getting hassled.  Come on.  I'm trying to move us around.  It's kind of funny.  Come on, officers.  Hey, Mark, what's happening?  Well, right now, there's got to be at least three or four thousand people outside MTV Studios.  It's a complete zoo.  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  There's a bunch of other radio stations that are trying to drive their vans by, but they're not doing a very good job of it.  Yeah.  And there's actually a bunch of people out there with wild signs.  There was a couple of trips across the street.  It actually looked really cool.  She said it was wild signs.  And hopefully, maybe we can see some cans on TRL Live.  All right.  Looks like she's about to go back up live.  And here we go.  We're going to move.  The cops are making us move.  All right.  You're live.  You're live.  All right.  Oh, there you are.  I see the wow.  Yeah.  The wow right behind Madonna there. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, there has been a crowd.  We're surrounded by cops.  They're making us get off the street.  Oh, brother.  Oh, that sucks.  Let's get everybody cordoned off over here.  It's pretty wild.  Where's the girl at the live sign?  Let's hear that.  Camille.  Camille, where you from?  Upstate New York.  She's from upstate New York.  And you came all the way down here at the live sign?  Yep.  I saw that.  She called me.  She's all the way from upstate.  She's got a big orange live sign.  Yeah, I saw that one.  Yeah.  She went below the window there.  But we're going to try and cross the street and get some more cameras on over there. 
[01:14:00]  All right.  What's that?  All right.  We're going to go to the other side of the street there.  Oh, boy.  It's a hustle, but we're just going to keep whittling our way around here.  All right, man.  In front of all of your teeny boppers there.  Madonna's still attracting teeny boppers?  Hey, we might be on right now.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Woo!  He's got 11.  He's got 11.  They're trying to keep the wow sign off.  They're doing tight shots.  I see one of you guys raising your arms. 
[01:14:30]  That was pretty good.  Yeah, I don't know if it's making a bunch.  Yeah, you guys are like on the very corner of the screen, Mark.  Yeah, very tight security there for the Madonna appearance.  All right, I'm out of here.  I'm going to go stand on the sidewalk.  I'm getting really nasty work.  They're about to punch my teeth out.  I'm going to get toned up in about two seconds.  Toned up.  Yeah, what's up?  I, Detective Tamiko.  You're annoying my captain.  All right, don't stop. 
[01:15:00]  You're going to lose the flag and you're going to get locked up.  All right, use your head and be smart.  Go inside and enjoy yourself.  All right.  Stop walking around the need of the section.  I'm going to get an asshole for yourself.  Okay.  What's your name, Sean?  It's Detective Tamiko, a mid-town shot.  Very good.  See you, Mark.  Okay.  There was the son-up.  You're going to get toned up.  Oh, so he was all business, too.  He was wearing a suit.  He wasn't even wearing a uniform.  Hey.  He was not happy.  Yeah, he didn't sound it.  We'll have to stay here with the rest of the wolves. 
[01:15:30]  All right, Mark.  Hey, we'll check back in and we'll see what we can do.  All right, very good.  Psycho Mark reporting live from outside the MTV studios.  It's a mob scene down there for Madonna.  Thank you, Psycho Mark.  Cops hassling him and everything.  God damn.  They're very serious about keeping traffic clear, I guess, or something.  Hey, Jim, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Not too bad.  Good.  These guys are great, man.  I've seen that guy with the hat. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, you saw the hat guy on MTV?  Yeah, he's right out of the corner right there.  Yeah.  Oh, that was great, man.  All right, cool.  No, this is syndication now.  You guys suck.  All right, thank you, Jim.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Ron.  Ron, you're next on NEW.  Hey, how are you doing, guys?  What's up?  Hey, great.  I'm glad to see you guys again.  I saw it just 10 seconds on the lower right-hand corner, right behind, but that was behind,  and they saw a little bit of a wild sign out there.  Yeah, they're having a tough time today because it's a mob scene.  They ought to go somewhere else where they get the real-life shots and stuff.  Maybe if you get lucky, maybe by two news, who knows what's going to happen next. 
[01:16:30]  I mean, that live, that wow, the lit-up wow hat, you've got to get that on TV.  That's going to be a classic right there.  Yeah, we've got to find out where all the TV crews are setting up today.  If anyone knows, let us know, okay?  Sure.  By the way, I got the picture back from you guys.  The picture I took for you last time is possible.  If you come down one of these days and sign those pictures?  Yeah, one of these days, no problem.  You got it.  All right, we're just in kind of a bad mood today, though.  Don't worry.  Just keep a straight face, all right?  All right, thank you.  All right, bye.  Yeah, we're all moody.  We have receptionists yelling at us. 
[01:17:00]  Giving out the phone number.  All right, let's take a break, Anthony.  All right.  And we'll be back.  See you then.  Hey, kids.  It's your old pal, Krusty.  And if I wasn't blackmailed into a lifetime contract with Itchy and Scratchy, I'd have Opie and Anthony on my show.  Syndication now.  Hey, I'm John Stewart, and I listen to Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  These guys have problems, but you know that. 
[01:17:30]  Yes, we do, John.  All right, I think we need to regroup, Anthony.  We've got to clear the phone lines.  My God.  I think we're going to play a couple songs, and we'll be back.  To clear the lines, let's give out some wrestling tickets, okay?  All right.  Winner receives a pair of tickets to the WWF, Saturday, April 15th at the Garden, before you can buy them, plus a WWF T-shirt.  Tickets go on sale this Sunday at 10 a.m. through Ticketmaster.  The 10th caller gets the ticks. 
[01:18:00]  212-757-1027.  This is N.E.W.  We'll be back in two.  I'm used to the crazy people.  Oh, don't ever underestimate the cycle factor in my head.  Are you mental?  No!  It's our show!  I'm a mad man!  I'm getting hit!  You sound like a stark, raving mad person.  No!  I'm getting hit!  No!  No!  Don't ever underestimate the cycle factor in my head.  No! 
[01:18:30]  O.B.M. Anthony.  How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?  1027-WNEW.  Ah, yes.  Another fine program in progress today.  Yes.  Anthony's falling apart on me.  Ah.  I feel like crap, huh?  Well, you know, I don't normally get sick.  That's why it's very strange.  You never get sick.  Oh, look at this hack.  This hacking cough thing. 
[01:19:00]  It's killing my chest.  Uh.  I just want to shoot.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up?  How are you?  Hey.  You guys are great.  I listen to you guys every day.  Well, we're trying.  Thank you, Chris.  Yeah.  I was watching.  I told Chris a lot.  I raced right home from work with you guys on the way home.  I was watching right in the left-hand corner.  You could see a big white painted song like a sheep.  Yeah, I know.  Psycho Mark and the Psycho Pass out in full force down there at TRL today.  Oh, and then all of a sudden you see the sheep go away.  They pan the camera to the right, and there's two cops standing there. 
[01:19:30]  I was like, oh, no way.  Yeah, they kind of got in trouble.  Oh, really?  Yeah, a little bit.  Oh, I figured as much.  Cops don't move along.  Well, thank you, Chris.  I'm glad you saw that today.  All right, man.  Syndication now.  All right, bro.  Let's go to James.  James, you're next on N.E.W.  What's going on?  Yeah, congratulations, gentlemen.  Those guys did a great job.  The other side, on the right side where Madonna was standing, was totally empty.  And then on the left side is a bunch of lunatics jumping around with a big white sign.  Yeah, there had to be, what, about 20 of them or so, huh? 
[01:20:00]  It was a nice group.  The opposite side of the camera angle was totally blank.  There was no one there on that corner.  But the other corner is just a bunch of lunatics.  And then MTU, they started doing real tight shots.  To keep them out of the frame.  Yeah, yeah.  I noticed that.  The second you saw, like, the big white and red wow sign go up, that was it.  They just kept them close.  Cool, James.  Thank you.  Nice job.  I'm glad you saw that.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, man.  Let's check in with Psycho Mark.  He's on the warm line that the receptionist feels like giving everyone today. 
[01:20:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Psycho Mark?  Oh, hey, Anthony.  What do you sound?  A little sick.  Sounds like full-blown A's.  Jesus.  There you go, man.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  I couldn't help myself.  So what's going on out there?  We've got about 20 guys out here.  And there's a live shot, I guess, across the street here.  They're trying to get in.  Oh, really?  We've got like 20, 25 lunatics just absolutely out of their mind running around here with  big wild signs.  And it's just nuts.  As a matter of fact, they stopped TRL, so it's like we're sort of standing around looking 
[01:21:00]  for something to do.  Yeah, I know.  You guys got to find some trouble.  Yeah, well, they're looking for a live shot, but there's nothing going on down here.  But you should have seen all the gas down here from the bottom.  It was unbelievable.  Well, they had a great crowd out there today.  Yeah, no, it worked out well.  I guess the cops shut us down pretty quick.  Yeah.  Because you know how they are.  But they're doing their job.  Those guys are good guys.  What's the age bracket of the typical Madonna fan these days?  Like 12.  Really? 
[01:21:30]  She's still getting teeny boppers?  That's a little weird.  It's mostly teeny boppers.  A lot of gay guys?  I didn't see any gay guys.  No?  But tons of chicks.  It was unbelievable.  We horrified so many people because these guys are chanting, you know, show us your blue  nut, you know, and whip them out and scream and all kinds of stuff.  There was a family right in front of us.  They grabbed all their kids and just walked away.  Absolutely horrified.  They're like, oh, wow, look at MTV.  How nice.  And then these guys all started screaming and yelling and they just grabbed their kids and 
[01:22:00]  went as fast as they could away from us, you know?  It was nuts.  Well, you guys got to continue the...  Yeah, we got it on TV, guys.  We're all going to get arrested.  Well, Mark, the psychopaths are growing as we speak, huh?  Yeah, it is pretty wild.  It is a lot.  All right.  Oh, my God.  All right, guys.  We'll check back in later.  All right, Mark.  We'll get a couple of these lunatics back to the stage.  Thank you.  Want me to give them out the VIP number?  Ah, no.  I think a lot of people have it already. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, God.  All right, Mark.  We got to go.  All right, guys.  We need to roll, baby.  Peace.  Oh, bunch of lunatics.  You sure you want them back here?  That would give me a headache, Anthony.  I know.  I already have one.  Yes.  Syndication now.  That's a joke.  Every other show that started this week on NEW was already syndicated.  Yeah, I know.  Not us.  No way.  No, that's not too frustrating for your pals, Opie and Anthony.  Well, there's a reason. 
[01:23:00]  We're loose cannons, Opie.  Not team players.  Well, we were trying to be team players yesterday, and they don't know what to do with us.  But, yeah.  Yeah, but we weren't wanted.  But we did try.  Let's go to Douglas.  Douglas, what's going on, man?  What's up, Opie?  How are you?  All right.  Check it out.  Go to CBS Studios outside.  There's nobody around that's showing live shots.  Oh, dude, that's our company.  So?  We're in enough trouble. 
[01:23:30]  Believe me.  Like, we need that.  Green Day's coming around?  When are we getting them in here?  Yeah, we should get Green Day in.  And they're good friends on the show.  They had a blast last time we were hooked up with them.  Ruined our studio, but a lot of fun.  You remember that?  Yeah.  We had Green Day.  Last time we talked to Green Day, they were just drinking beers and smoking dope.  And we allowed them to just start breaking CDs.  Yeah.  And they broke our huge clock in the studio. 
[01:24:00]  They threw a CD right through the clock face.  Yeah, they like their pot.  That's for sure.  They're going to be on the Warped Tour this summer, Anthony.  Yeah.  Very cool.  And we'll hook up with them.  All right.  Enough with the wow on TRL.  I think we covered that.  Yeah.  We appreciate that you guys checked it out.  Moving to California.  How can we lose listeners?  I hate that.  Hey, Jill.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Hi.  I was just wondering, how come a guy like Tom Likas can be syndicated, but you guys can't? 
[01:24:30]  I don't know.  That blows my mind.  I don't know.  Hey, listen.  What about women with like, you know how you have like Hummer Tuesday and all that?  Yeah.  We're trying to find something for you ladies.  I know what you're going to say.  We just haven't found anything that's catching on yet.  How about like Finger Friendly Friday?  Finger Friendly?  That sounds pretty good.  How about Finger Paint Friday?  Sure.  All right.  We'll figure something out for you ladies eventually.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Jill.  Thanks.  All right. 
[01:25:00]  Bye-bye.  We've got to say goodbye to Judy.  She's moving to California.  Judy?  Yes?  Where are you going?  Oh, my God.  I didn't think my phone call warranted being put on the air, but...  No, we don't like when people leave, so we've got to figure out why you're going.  I'm going because I've been living in New York all my life, I'm 27, and I've got to get out.  No, my brother and sister live in L.A., so I'm going to move out there and...  L.A., are you going to become a porn star?  I don't think so.  What are your dreams when you go out to L.A.?  What are you going to do?  Well, I'm going to become a right, actually. 
[01:25:30]  You want to write?  Yeah.  Like porno movies?  I'm just saying, any...  I could.  ...any girl that goes out to L.A.  I guess I could.  ...for any career in the arts...  Uh-huh.  ...always ends up somehow in pornography.  I guess I could.  I don't know if I'm that desperate, though.  You just need a new start out there?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I don't know.  I wouldn't move out there unless they were out there, so...  You're not a coke whore or anything?  No, no, no, no.  I've never done that.  Uh-uh.  No, but I just love you guys.  I've been listening to you since day one, and I'd like to get a T-shirt and just advertise 
[01:26:00]  for the show, and...  When are you going?  Next month.  Well, come on by and get your T-shirt.  Well, I'm kind of up in the suburbs.  Are you?  It's kind of hard, yeah.  All right, hold on.  Let me see if Ben can send you a shirt off, all right?  Thank you very much.  And good luck in California.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  Do you have any plans, Opie, for when we go to California on the first?  We're going out there for WrestleMania?  Yeah.  Well, you've got to go to the comedy store.  Check out the...  Uh-huh.  Check out the acts.  Yeah.  I'm hoping to see Dice there again. 
[01:26:30]  Mm-hmm.  Bomb.  And, well, I've got a couple of plans.  You do?  I'm going to rent a car, go down to my old stomping ground of San Juan Capistrano,  right there where the Swallows come back every year.  And I think I'm going to make a serious effort to look for Dreamweaver  and see if we can't get her on the air.  Are you serious?  Why not?  Do you know who she is?  Yeah, I think so.  I think I've got a couple of people that I might be able to contact  that could get me in touch with the actual Dreamweaver. 
[01:27:00]  And you think she's still living in the area?  I don't know.  I want you to get a...  It's a mystery.  I want you to get a hold of...  Buzz?  Oh, Buzz.  Right?  Girl that's...  That took your virginity away from her?  Yeah, yeah.  When I was, like, 13.  The girl that your dad set you up with?  Yeah, yeah, Buzz.  I don't know.  She was, like, 22 at the time or something.  That's a while ago.  So she'll be, yeah.  But she's got to be in the area. 
[01:27:30]  I would love to talk to the girl that took your virginity.  I'll see if I'm going to definitely try to get in touch with some of these people,  get some numbers at least, so we can talk to them.  Right.  You know, dredge up a little of my sordid past.  Because the Buzz story is classic.  You were, what, 13?  13 years old.  13th birthday, as a matter of fact.  My father thought, you know, he's from the mindset that at 13 years old,  you've got to get your son laid, you know?  So he leaves the house and sends Buzz over. 
[01:28:00]  Did he pay her?  No.  Buzz has been a friend of the family's and stuff, you know?  Like, you know, she'd bang anyone.  So she's there hanging out.  You know, I've been riding all day, a little dirty.  She goes, oh, why don't you go up to take a shower?  I'm like, oh, okay.  Okay.  I'll shower then, not thinking anything.  I just run upstairs, hop in the shower.  I get out of the shower.  Got my little shorts on.  I'm only, you know, 13 years old, Opie. 
[01:28:30]  Ready to walk back down the stairs, watch some TV with Buzz.  And I hear from the bedroom, are you coming in?  Like, hmm, that's weird.  That sounds like Buzz from the bedroom.  I wonder what Buzz is doing in the bedroom.  I just got out of the shower.  I was going to go downstairs, watch some TV, Buzz.  Oh, oh, no.  Oh, my God.  This is it.  Finally clicked in my head.  This is it.  Walked in.  Just remember seeing Buzz.  She had huge cans. 
[01:29:00]  Huge.  She was sitting, like, sitting up in the bed, propped up by some pillows.  Uh-huh.  And the sheet was right at her hips.  And her huge boobs were just hanging out in the open.  It was the most remarkable thing I'd seen in my life at that point.  They're just there going, take me, Anthony, take me.  Everything else I had seen up to that point has been in magazine or some cheesy film.  This was, like, live boobage.  I was just like, oh, oh, my goodness.  Oh, here, here we go. 
[01:29:30]  This is going to be it.  And, yeah, you never forget the first time you see live boobs.  Hopped into bed.  She's like, you know, she starts moving her hands kind of over me and stuff.  Like, oh, okay, that's good.  She moves down further, further.  And then she goes for the grab.  And she has to go, uh, why don't you take those shorts off?  Dude, I got into bed still with the shorts on.  What a tool.  What do you remember from that first experience, though? 
[01:30:00]  I mean, how long did it last?  Was it just the best thing ever, ever, ever, ever?  It wasn't a two-second thing because I think I was spanking it in the shower.  Not knowing that anything was going to happen.  No, I don't remember really any details.  I mean, it was cool and all, you know.  And then I went off to school the next day.  What did you do right after?  Right after?  Yeah, did she, like, leave or something?  I smoked a cigarette.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Did you go back to playing with your Hot Wheels or something?  You know what I mean?  Hot Wheels?  I wasn't playing with Hot Wheels.  You know what I'm saying, though.  At 13, you're still like, well, I'm heading toward being an adult kind of, but I'm also still a kid.  It must have been a little weird.  I think I went back downstairs and watched some TV.  Yeah.  You know?  I think I watched...  Did she quickly leave or was it just that awkward...  No, you know, she kind of hung out on the couch, watched a little TV.  Yeah.  I was like, okay, hey, look at that.  This is great. 
[01:31:00]  Watch Bob Bob Blacksheet.  My fingers smell funny.  You had to go there.  Why?  They did.  Marissa, come on, the first time?  You're just like a dog at that point.  Come on, smell my finger.  That continued for a while, too, like about a year.  Marissa, what's going on?  Hey, how are you?  That's a sick little story of just nothing really...  Oh, it's not even a story. 
[01:31:30]  It's just...  I don't know.  You guys are just so visual.  Oh, look at that.  Where are you right now?  In my car.  Really?  Yeah.  That sounds like a prank.  What?  It kind of sounds like a prank.  Trust me.  We've heard enough Bob-a-booies today.  No.  You want to know something?  Tell him F-Nackey.  I listen to him in the morning, but that's just...  It's getting lame.  It's getting old. 
[01:32:00]  I don't know.  There's just something about you guys.  I just...  Whenever I hear your voices, I just want to touch myself.  All right.  That's pretty good.  We like that.  Wow.  Wow.  What are you wearing now?  Well, I have thigh-high stockings on.  I'm wearing a song.  I've got my suit on for work, and...  Are you a hooker?  No, I'm not.  And I'm closing my eyes so I don't have to look at Anthony while you describe yourself.  All right, go ahead.  I'm a fucking hooker. 
[01:32:30]  I actually...  I was getting really distracted.  I'm like, I have to close my eyes.  Okay.  What kind of body do you have?  I'm about 5'5".  Yeah.  115.  Oh, yeah.  I'm very athletic.  I run very limber.  I'm a little muscular, but I'm very small-framed.  Uh-huh.  And you're all turned on as you're in your car on the way home?  I'm sitting here on the highway with one hand between my legs. 
[01:33:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  And the other hand...  Careful, right.  ...holding the phone.  Wow.  You must be driving real slow.  Actually, no.  I'm stepping really hard on the accelerator.  Yeah.  Oh.  Now, what part of the tri-state area are you in?  New Jersey.  Jersey?  Mm-hmm.  I would love to get out of your car so everyone could check you out.  What?  Are you like...  What are you doing besides that?  You're like...  Well, I'm actually driving home from work.  And you're petting the poodle? 
[01:33:30]  I don't have much of a poodle to pet.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's pretty close-crossed.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  See, I'm an accountant, and I wear very, very sexy underwear under very, very conservative  suits.  All right, listen.  It's kind of like a little secret I have.  You're killing me.  Not as much as you kill me.  Well, tell me more.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:34:00]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, what's she going to do?  She's going to do it right there in the car?  I'm going through my handbook right now, seeing what we can get away with.  Don't crash.  Well, what would you like me to do?  Well, could you give us, like, a fake orgasm?  Sure.  Of course, it may be fake, I think.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Marissa?  You suck.  I knew she was going to do that.  What'd she do, hung up?  She hung up.  Maybe she crashed. 
[01:35:00]  Marissa?  You're C.T.  I hate you.  Ah.  She got us good, man.  She hung up.  These guys want to kill her.  Oh.  Ah.  Bob, what's going on?  Ah.  That chick, man.  You know, I wanted to play What's in My Pants with this broad on the phone.  Yeah.  I was going to ask her that next, but she hung up.  Oh, my God.  Hey, boy.  She got us good right there, man.  I can't believe it. 
[01:35:30]  Let's review the list of people that have said, I've been here longer than you.  Yeah.  Everyone has said that to Aunt Nye at one time or another.  Let's see.  There's Scott Muni.  Mm-hmm.  Dave Herman.  Mm-hmm.  Um, the retard receptionist.  Mm-hmm.  Absolutely.  And, uh...  Carol Miller.  Yeah, Carol Miller.  Uh, you know, let's see.  Where are all they?  Well, we were supposed to be fired, uh, four months into this job, and miraculously, we're  up to a year and nine months today.  A year and nine months.  Mm-hmm.  Today?  Yeah.  My goodness.  It's been that long. 
[01:36:00]  It just seems like yesterday that, uh, you two, uh, came on and started terrorizing  the city, as it were.  Well, we're trying.  All right, guys.  Syndication yesterday, and, uh, I hope to see you, uh, on TV sometime.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  Bye.  We gotta get to some of these guys that are really pissed off.  Larry, what's up?  What a biatch.  Oh, man.  She set us up bad.  Oh, man.  She got you guys good.  But you fell into it, you know?  Well, I had a feeling something was going on, man.  Couldn't you tell she wasn't on a cell phone? 
[01:36:30]  Uh, no.  No?  It was clear as day.  It sounded like a cell phone a little bit.  What was that?  Kind of sounded like a cell phone.  No, come on.  She was pulling your third leg.  You know, Larry, it still sounded pretty cool.  I don't care.  Oh, listen, I enjoyed it.  She had a good little, uh, visual mind going there.  Yeah, it wasn't bad at all.  All right.  You knew when she was getting descriptive like that?  Yeah.  You knew it was a hoax.  That's all right.  At that point, you had to jump boat.  All right, Larry, thank you.  Let's go to Jim. 
[01:37:00]  Jim, you're next on N.E.W.  What's going on?  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  Good, excellent, man.  Yeah, I got a chubby.  Where'd she go?  She hung up on it.  Gone.  She got me a mid-stroke.  I had a feeling she was up to something, but it was still pretty cool.  Yeah, these new radio guys I listened to in the morning.  I was listening to Like Us on the way to work, and I changed that over.  I heard these guys this morning, the Love Lines?  They were pretty funny.  We've had Love Lines on for a while.  Yeah.  They had a good one.  Douchebag?  Douche nozzle. 
[01:37:30]  Are you trying to prank us, Jim?  No, not at all.  Come on, guys.  I'm a long-time listener.  What's with douche nozzle?  Yeah, I don't care what you're getting at.  Well, that's what they were saying last night.  You know, everybody says douchebag, douchebag.  What about douche nozzle?  I guess you ought to be there.  All right, guys.  Peace out.  Simmication yesterday.  All right, Jim.  Let's go to Rain.  Oh, my God.  Rain, what's going on?  Is the medication making my mind work a little weird, and I'm hearing different things that  are actually happening on today's show, Opie? 
[01:38:00]  I think you're a step slow.  We're both a step slow today.  I'm not sure.  Is it the callers, or is it me?  I don't know.  Rain, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  All right, man.  Hey, man, you guys are killing me out here with this girl moaning and groaning.  Yeah, yeah.  I was damn near almost ran my truck off the road.  Well, let's try to get her back on the line to finish what she started, all right?  Oh, definitely.  But, you know, I'm out here trying to make deliveries.  You know, it's hard to be delivering keggers.  Right.  He delivers keggers.  Yeah, I got the, we deliver keggers sign right here on my front windshield. 
[01:38:30]  But it's been a long time, my listener has been going back to, hell, to your very first  show there when Anthony was describing the radio, so, uh, the radio between his, uh,  nope.  What?  Wait a minute.  All right, Rain, Rain, I'm going to cut you off, okay?  Yeah, yeah, I'm lost in here.  Sorry, guys.  I think the medication's really affecting me.  Every caller sounds completely friggin' retarded.  Amos.  Yeah.  How's Andy?  Huh?  What's up, Amos? 
[01:39:00]  Nothing much.  All right.  I listen to you guys all the time coming, uh, home from, uh, work.  Yeah, we appreciate that.  I try to get to that, uh...  We get that by now.  I don't think we need to bring that up with every call.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So, what's up, Amos?  Nothing much.  I tried to get to that show that you guys had last week.  Yeah.  It was a...  It was too many people were there.  I know.  We apologize.  We're going to get a bigger venue for the next one.  Oh, definitely.  What do you have for...  I definitely wanted to go.  What do you have for today?  Um, just wanted to say what's up.  Oh, my God.  All right, Amos. 
[01:39:30]  Thank you.  Thanks.  Oh, no.  I don't know if you guys are aware of this, but we're trying to do a radio show here.  I just want to say what's up.  Hey, what's up?  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  How are you?  I'm good.  Good.  I wanted to thank you guys.  Uh, last night, I earned my Red Wings because of you guys.  Oh, how did that happen?  Why?  Because of us.  Well, the girl that I was with, she's big fans of yours.  Well, you know, it didn't matter what, you know.  Last night, so I'm hanging out or whatever, getting busy, doing what I got to do, and  I wanted to go, you know, take care of business down there. 
[01:40:00]  She didn't want it.  She wasn't having it, so I convinced her that you guys were into it.  You thought it was cool.  It was nice, whatever.  And, lo and behold, I earned my Red Wings.  Wow.  So, I just wanted to thank you guys.  Why would you want to do that?  Well, it's a weird, dreadish kind of thing.  A lot of guys are into it.  That is, there's not a lot of guys into that one.  Oh, yeah?  There's a big, big secret society out there.  It's a very, it's a very secret society. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, very secret.  Looks like you just drank grape juice.  Grape juice?  What are you dating?  I love grape juice.  So, I just wanted to thank you guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Can I get a shirt for that?  No, Joe.  Come on, man.  We don't have, we don't have any other shirts to give away right now.  Go to eBay and get a We Deliver Kegger shirt for 40 bucks just selling on eBay.  Jesus.  All right.  Thank you, Joe. 
[01:41:00]  Guys, guys in general are not into the whole Red Wings.  Red Wings thing.  Getting your Red Wings.  I don't know.  Under what circumstance?  All right.  Elisa wants to moan for us.  Elisa.  Yes.  That girl kept everyone hanging.  I know.  How are you?  Where are you calling from?  I'm from Jersey.  Yeah?  Are you hot?  Yeah.  Real hot?  Very.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are you?  No. 
[01:41:30]  I got the worst haircut.  You can lie, you know.  No.  So, give us a moan.  Give me a moan.  Yeah.  Okay.  Continue where she left off.  Okay.  All right.  How's that?  Why are you laughing? 
[01:42:00]  Because I'm high.  You're high?  Ah, now it's making sense.  I think everyone smoked dope today before the show.  Smoke a little weed.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  Uh-oh.  Can I hear one of you guys moan?  No.  Why?  That's disgusting.  You don't want to hear guys moan.  Yeah, I do. 
[01:42:30]  I'm going to moan in pain.  Oh, Sambia.  All right, guys.  Hello.  I love Scott.  You're so high.  All right.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  You guys should smoke weed on the show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That would be a great radio show.  Stay there.  The Opie in Indonesia.  Oh, doopey.  Wow.  Boop, boop, boop.  Or stupidity on the way.  Oh, yeah.  Ah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.  WNEW. 
[01:43:30]  Opie, you're a sick ass man.  Anthony.  You're not a jackass.  You're obviously a star.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It makes me sexy.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  The fax line.  We're not getting many faxes today, but if you want to send one, 2-1-2-9-5-7-9-6-3-9.  And, uh, forget about the instant feedback for now.  Oh, no.  Well.  Ah, is it working? 
[01:44:00]  Not really.  I can't get anything online now.  This pisses me off.  We need to be connected with our listeners and, uh, well, from time to time, we get folks  in the instant feedback.  Thank God it didn't happen before, uh, 4.  Oh, wait.  We just...  I'm busy trading, uh, Opie.  It's working again.  Mike from down the street.  Chill out, guys, with the chicks.  My goddamn boss just walked by and I got in trouble because of the freaking moaning.  I'm going to get written for...  Written up for listening to a pleasant radio show. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, man.  I had to hit the coffee up.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We're all just, like, pounding the coffee now.  I was...  Between the cold medication and the callers lulling me to sleep today.  Oh, yeah.  This is just crack in a cup right now.  I'm ready.  I'm ready to go.  Well, you don't drink coffee, so when you do, it's just, like, put you over the top. 
[01:45:00]  This is great.  Well, Ant, look at our choices of, uh, stories on the, on the phone lines.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  They're all the same.  They're all about Red Wings.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  All right.  I got a pretty horrible one.  I was kind of, uh, not tricked, but, uh, I dated this girl like a month ago, and, uh,  my buddy and I took these two girls out to teachers at a high school and, uh, chaperoned  to dance for them.  We came back.  And I ended up sleeping with one girl. 
[01:45:30]  Dang, my buddy talked to me about it, and he's like, uh, he's like, yeah, man.  He's like, uh, there was a tampon in the, in the bathroom.  Oh, no.  Yeah, it was horrible.  And I thought about it, I was like, well, you know, I didn't, because you would kind  of, you would think you would know, you know?  You would think.  Well, why wouldn't the, the ladies tell us?  Well, see, I, that's the thing.  She got up and went to the bathroom and came back.  When she came back, she came back with a condom.  So I thought, you know, that's all I thought she went for.  Well, maybe it's a light day or something, you know?  Well, I don't think it was.  And if you're just going for sex. 
[01:46:00]  Even, well, even still, if it was the last day, that's fine, but that's just rude.  Tell a guy, you know?  Just say, hey, listen, don't do that, you know?  What's my...  Yeah, ladies, help us out, man.  Help us out.  It was ridiculous.  It's your head going there, and it's like, what, it's supposed to tap you on the shoulder?  Oh, I haven't spoken to her since.  Please hold.  I haven't spoken.  I'm not that pissed off about it, but it's just one of those things where, like, it's  a standoff thing.  She wants to call me, she can, but that pissed me off to the extent.  Wow.  You really got pissed at that, huh?  Oh, it's ridiculous. 
[01:46:30]  I mean, that's, I'm sorry, that's rude, because, I don't know.  All right, Brian.  That's rude.  Well, thank you.  All right, guys, you guys are great.  Well, on other days.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  I got a pretty brutal Red Wing story myself.  Yeah?  About a year or two back, my buddy and I were at a local bar, and we were just getting absolutely  smashed off of tequila shots.  And we met up with a couple of these girls, and one thing led to a number.  We all ended up splitting up, and I ended up going home with this one chick. 
[01:47:00]  And we stopped off on the road on the way home, and we just started going to town.  And we ended up doing a little bit of, I don't know, muff diving.  Yep, yep, yep.  And next thing I know, she just drops me off at my house.  I can't remember anything.  And I wake up the next morning, and I'm looking at my hands.  All right, all right, I know what you're going to say.  Looked like you've been staining the deck outside, right?  All right, so I'm a little hungover. 
[01:47:30]  I've got to go to the bathroom.  I just get done, you know, draining the vein.  And I go to wash my hands off, and I look up, and I just go to brush my teeth.  Okay, all right.  I think we can figure it out.  That was it.  But here's the kicker.  Yes, dude.  A couple months later, I was dating a new girl.  We're in the same bar.  This chick walks in again, and she comes up to me like, hey, how are you doing?  Now, I was just totally pretending like I didn't know who the hell she was.  The girl that I was with at the time turned around and looked at me, and she goes, do you know her? 
[01:48:00]  And I said, no, not at all.  But if that girlfriend wasn't with me, I think I would have hauled off and knocked her head off right there.  I don't understand how these guys can have a fetish.  Yeah, there's a bunch of guys checking in saying, yeah, they're into that.  Yeah, yeah, we believe you.  No way, man.  All right, thank you, Steve.  Take care, guys.  All right, buddy.  Let's go to Joe.  Enough with the Red Wings stories.  Joe, what's going on?  Thank you.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Hey, a cop is following me now.  I'm following a Channel 2 news van. 
[01:48:30]  You're following a news van?  Why?  Yeah, Channel 2, because I'm going to get on live at 6 o'clock at the power plant.  Leave Channel 2 alone.  No, two vans.  I'm getting them.  I got four guys meeting me here in a few minutes.  You got the wow signs?  Yep, I got two wow signs.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  All right.  And listen, by the way, if it's a big story, I'm sure, you know, there'll be other news  crews out there, Anthony.  Yes, true.  You know, I just don't want to talk about anything in the news.  There's nothing going on in the news. 
[01:49:00]  I mean, the whole strawberry thing is huge.  We've discussed that.  Done.  Know what my latest stance on the whole strawberry thing is, Ant?  What?  I don't think they should have suspended him from baseball.  No?  No.  I think as long as he performs on the field, it doesn't really matter what he does in his  private life.  What you do in your private life?  Yeah, because think about it.  There's some kind of morals clause, I think.  They got to do something.  Yeah, but I mean, there's a million people out there that do drugs in their job, and no 
[01:49:30]  one has any clue that they're doing it.  Yeah, but if they get caught...  And they're continuing to perform.  Hmm.  If he sucks on the field, then you get rid of him.  Then if he's doing well, they might say, well, it's drug-induced.  Well, as long as it's not like the steroids and stuff that enhance your ability to perform  on the field.  I don't know.  He's got some problems.  I think his career's over.  That's it.  He's got problems, but there's a lot of people that are listening to us right now that have  problems, and they still have their jobs, and no one has a clue that they're doing 
[01:50:00]  drugs.  For a second, Mark?  What?  You saw me at Stone on air.  You see that?  Yeah, I saw that.  At the Strawberry, things played out.  We discussed the Diallo thing.  A bunch of cops thanking us for our stance.  Well, I think it's a no-brainer.  It's kind of the obvious...  I don't know, man.  The media is killing the cops.  People are still demonstrating.  I don't understand why.  You know?  It's over.  In the words of everybody who is sympathetic to O.J. Simpson, 
[01:50:30]  Hey, you've got to accept the verdict.  I just...  That's how it goes down.  You know how I feel about that, Anthony?  Yeah.  I think the cops that were involved...  Yeah.  ...should quit.  Why?  Because, man, there's a lot of...  All the other cops are getting crap at this point.  They shouldn't quit.  Why should they have to quit?  They should.  They should go back on the job.  Do their job.  They'll never be able to go back on the job.  I would recognize one of them if I saw them on the street. 
[01:51:00]  They will be harassed so much.  It's not going to do anyone any good if they continue doing, you know, street crime, especially.  So, well, they're supposed to take an early retirement and open up a restaurant in Florida or something?  They should do that before they get, you know, fired.  There's no way they're going to stay in the force.  All these high-profile cases, they end up getting rid of the guys.  I don't know.  For the best interest of the police force.  I think they just ought to stick it out.  What if they just enjoy being cops? 
[01:51:30]  You know?  I don't know.  I don't know how they would enjoy being cops now.  I would love to talk to a couple cops about it.  I don't know.  It just sucks that all the other cops are getting, you know, crapped on.  Maybe that's why that one was so nasty to Psycho Mark down by TRL.  Why?  Maybe he's just feeling the pressure.  He's doing his job.  We understand that.  That was pretty funny.  I'm looking at all the other headlines. 
[01:52:00]  Quit jumping around here like an a-hole.  He calls Mark an a-hole.  Battle of the boy bands.  Who cares?  Six-year-old shoots another six-year-old.  Very sad story.  That's great.  Jesus Christ.  Hunt for the new Kathy Lee.  Who cares?  Oh, Hunt.  Okay.  I get confused.  My ears are clogging up from the cold.  I thought you said something else that wouldn't have made it on the air. 
[01:52:30]  Hunt.  Okay.  Another guy shoots up at McDonald's.  I know.  We saw that story, too.  That happened today.  I don't go.  I missed that one.  I don't go to McDonald's for that reason.  You might get shot up.  I'm sure they'll list all the past shootings in the paper tomorrow.  That's always good.  You need the checklist of all the other shootings when there's a shooting.  You know, here's the top ten worst shootings in American history.  And they list them down. 
[01:53:00]  McDonald's.  Yeah, that place has had a couple of shootings, hasn't it?  Casey, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys?  Hey.  Are you seriously saying that his performance would not change?  What do you mean?  On cocaine?  No, I don't know.  I think there's a lot of people out there that are doing coke and doing their jobs well.  Yeah, but in sports, doesn't that not count?  Doesn't that not count?  What are you trying to say, Casey?  Is that not fair?  I mean, if he was doing steroids or something, he'd be in trouble, right? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  So, same thing.  I could play for the Yankees on cocaine.  All right.  Sign you up.  Come on.  Everyone's on cocaine.  We need a DH.  No, it's been ten years.  It's been ten years.  We need a DH this year, so give it a try.  It would make a difference, believe me.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye.  We've got a cop on the line.  The strawberry thing, who cares?  Danny, what's up?  Yeah, listen.  Yeah.  These guys might get psyched off the job because they're, like, all stressed out now. 
[01:54:00]  So, they might give them a disability pension.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, because that's what I got.  Not from sight.  From a knee injury.  And I'm just hanging out now.  Going to school.  I'm just trying to get into your heads today there, Danny.  I mean, obviously, most of you guys supported the cops through the trial and stuff.  And now a lot of you guys are getting a lot of crap from the protesters and stuff.  I mean, how do you really feel at this point?  Listen, my phone's crapping out.  Can I call you back?  Oh, why?  Are you a little scared to talk about it? 
[01:54:30]  No, I'm not.  My phone's crapping out.  I'll talk about it.  All right, call back.  All right.  We've got a couple other people checking in.  Terry, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Real good.  Listen, those guys shouldn't quit.  They should just stay on, and that's it.  There's no way.  Why should they quit?  Well, honestly, I'm just bringing up something.  I'm trying to get into your heads today to see what you guys are thinking.  That's all.  Well, we supported them all the way, and that's it.  And they shouldn't quit.  They've got to support their own families.  What are you going to do?  Start a new career at this point? 
[01:55:00]  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Do you think they're going to let them go, though, the NYPD?  I hope not.  I don't, you know, I'm hoping not.  On what grounds?  Staffer said that, you know, he agreed with the verdict, so maybe he's supporting them, too.  Right.  They can't get fired for this?  On what grounds?  There's no, there's no...  I was reading a bunch of articles in the past week.  It happens all the time with these high-profile cases.  They let them go.  You can't fire them.  That's true.  Or they reassign them, or they move them around.  They pretty much, you know, get them off the job, technically. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, Staffer turned around and said right away, he agreed with the verdict and how it went down.  Uh-huh.  You know, right away, the same day he said it, and that was it.  You know, and I think, so maybe that's a sign that he's supporting them.  Right.  All right.  I don't know.  All right, I'm just trying to, you know, get into your heads, trying to see what you guys are thinking today.  Take care.  All right, bro.  Let's go to John.  John!  Hey, John, you're next.  What's going on, ONA?  What's up, buddy?  This is Sean, not John.  Oh, sorry, Sean.  Yeah, I'm going to jump, too. 
[01:56:00]  They're going to fire these guys anyway.  They are.  That's what the job does.  Yeah, that's what the job does these days.  Anytime you bring negative light in the department, they fire.  Like that squeegee guy, not what he did was right, but he got off.  Uh-huh.  They fired him like three days ago.  That's right.  So these guys are done.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, that was the story I was trying to remember.  Well, what did they fire him for?  They were bringing negative light upon the department.  What they did was they said they didn't use their guns, deadly physical force, in an authorized kind of way.  So what is it?  It's like a catch-all.  It's like anything else.  Anytime they want to get ready, they can find a reason to get ready. 
[01:56:30]  And as far as these guys having to quit before then, I don't know if I agree with that,  because, you know, you deal with all this nonsense every day.  There's nothing you can do about it.  If Anthony says something stupid on the radio tomorrow and it brings heat down on you and Anthony,  what, are you going to quit, Opie?  Right.  No, I'm going to quit, you know?  No, John.  Well, that happens on a daily basis, and I hope he's still here.  John.  Anthony, you know what it is?  What?  Anthony, Red Devils, brother.  Oh, my God, Sean, yeah.  What's going on, kid?  This guy you used to play paintball with.  Yeah, how long are you on the job now?  Almost 10 years.  Get, wow.  Boy, that went fast. 
[01:57:00]  Time flies, right?  I haven't seen you since I'm in Nashville.  That was a trip and a half.  Yeah, we went to the air gun games, like paintball games, down in Nashville.  We were the proud team representing New York.  What happened, Sean?  We got our asses handed to us.  Oh, my God.  We almost got locked up a couple of times.  We went out, and we were all drunk until like 4 in the morning.  We go back to the hotel room, and then they wake us up at 6 to play paintball against this team from Tennessee.  Yeehaw.  We walked out there.  They handed us our asses. 
[01:57:30]  Go back home, Yankee.  Yeehaw.  I remember being behind a rock, and I'm like, they're closing in on us.  There's no way we're going to get out of this.  So I go, all right, I'm going to just stand up and run.  I figure I'll be able to maybe evade some of the shots.  The second I peeked up from behind the rock, I just got pummeled on.  Like, okay, I'm done.  Hey, we got to have a reunion game one of these days.  We'll take the red devil's out, and hope he'll get his own team, and we'll take him to school. 
[01:58:00]  Cool, man.  Not a bad idea for the spring.  Thank you, John.  Say hi to Jim, Sean.  Yeah, you got it later, man.  Hi, man.  Bye.  You had the name wrong.  It's John.  Suzanne.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good, Suzanne.  Well, I know you guys complain all the time that you don't have enough female callers, but here's one, and I'm a cop.  Are you sure you're a female?  I swear to God, I know I get that all the time.  Oh, my God.  I swear to God.  Okay.  I'm calling out the Diallo thing.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  Those four guys. 
[01:58:30]  That's a trick.  They've got families.  They've got kids.  It's a shame that people think that what they did is smoking.  That's right, Tommy.  That's absolutely right.  What happened to that voice of yours?  Nothing.  Smoking.  Smoking.  How much do you smoke?  What do you smoke?  Lincoln Logs.  No, not Lincoln Logs.  Are you still smoking?  Yeah, I am.  What?  Do you ever sound like a chick?  Yes, I do.  My husband thinks I do.  Thank you.  Repeat after me.  Yes.  Come here, big boy.  No. 
[01:59:00]  Just say it.  No, I just wanted to call you guys.  Oh, come on.  Hi.  I want to hear what it sounds like.  No.  I just wanted to say hello, and thank you guys for supporting us.  We need as much as we can get.  We're trying.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  Sexy, rascal voice, just like Demi Moore.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Not for nothing.  That Sean guy sounds like a moron.  Doesn't know what he's talking about.  John, actually.  Yeah, well, negative license police department.  Guys were in a shootout.  They're scared for their lives.  They shot somebody.  It was an accident. 
[01:59:30]  Unfortunately, they shot a lot, but it was an accident.  That was nothing to do with the screeching, you know?  Well, you cursed.  Half of that didn't.  I didn't curse.  Black-o.  I said effing.  Effing.  Oh, did I?  We heard you.  Oh, I did.  Sorry.  But these guys, they should keep their job.  Unfortunately, they're going to be under a lot of pressure.  Maybe they'll get an inside job, but the police department will give them a favor  and psych them out with three quarters and retire them early.  Okay.  God damn.  Well, thank you, Mike.  Later.  All right. 
[02:00:00]  We'll take one more, and then we've got to take a break.  Joe.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Good.  You're the last one on this subject.  What's up?  Well, I would love to talk to the Suffolk cops.  I don't have him go away.  No, I live in Suffolk.  Got to go find him.  I live out here in Suffolk, but I'm a New York City cop.  These guys are not facing any departmental charges.  There will be a firearms review board, however.  Yeah.  I believe they'll pass that firearms review board, and they definitely should keep their  jobs if they want to.  I'm not sure they're going to be able to.  Because in the end, when it was over, the guy, in fact, did not have a gun on him. 
[02:00:30]  There's been many confrontations I've been in where I damn near capped people.  And as it turned out, they were imitation, fake guns, or things that I thought were guns  where I was about to shoot somebody.  And, you know, after, when I thought it over, I was like, Jesus, what I would have felt  like afterwards would have been a good shooting like this was, but, you know, what it just  would have put me to, you know, and these guys, they may not want to do the job, but  I think they should keep the job if they want it.  Okay, Joe.  Thank you.  You're welcome. 
[02:01:00]  I was wrong.  I honestly thought a bunch of cops would think they should go away just to leave the pressure.  I, you know, that's why I wanted to, that's why I wanted to talk to some of the cops.  Johnny, you're a Suffolk cop?  Yeah.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  All right.  Suffolk.  I think these guys are cops.  Really?  Yeah, they're not going to be able to do their job.  Oh, yeah?  How can they do their job anymore?  What precinct are you out of?  The third precinct.  The third?  Yeah.  What is that, like Bayshore?  Yes.  Yeah.  You guys are a blast.  Well, yeah.  I love Suffolk cops.  Why is that? 
[02:01:30]  Do you make the most money?  Yeah, you make the most money.  I mean, my whole adolescence was spent with one of your cars behind my car.  Like, every time I went out, I was going, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, right?  You guys come out of nowhere in Suffolk.  Just pulled over and, God, you guys used to roust us all the time, man.  You can't just drive around in Suffolk County.  Like, New York, New York City, you're walking down the street, you're driving.  They don't give you a second look. 
[02:02:00]  Suffolk County, if you're on the road after, like, midnight, they will look at your car,  look into your car, give you a look as you're passing by, and, God damn, I don't know what  kind of night vision goggles you're looking at for that expiration date on the inspections  thing, but at night, on a dark road, you could spot that stuff.  And you guys make us so paranoid.  You get behind us, and we're like, oh, and you're just trying to keep the car straight.  You're probably not even buzzed, but sure enough, you're so freaked out.  All of a sudden, you're, I'm weaving because I'm spending half of the time I should be looking 
[02:02:30]  at the road, looking at the rear view.  Yeah.  Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.  You notice we all have those glasses on, too?  Yeah, the glasses, you come out of the car.  You guys are a little, you guys are a little, I don't know.  No, no, the New York City cops, they're a little more careful than you guys when they  come up to the car.  Well, they should be.  Like, they never walk right up to the door that's usually behind you.  Well, that's it.  You notice when they walk up, you'll see they have their hand right on their belt. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  You guys, it's like, hey, how you doing?  But anyway, these guys, they got, you know.  Barney Fyke, Jesus.  And it's brave to talk about you guys now because he doesn't drive in Suffolk County anymore.  I haven't been in Suffolk County in a while.  I need to bring that point up on the radio shows and talking about you guys.  I still drive all over Suffolk.  You Suffolk cops.  And I enjoy Suffolk County, and I support the Suffolk County cops.  You Suffolk cops.  What do they got you driving in these days?  Caddy Savilles?  Where are you driving there? 
[02:03:30]  The luxury cars.  What do they got?  Lexuses now on the bus?  Come on.  These guys are making money hand over fist, the Suffolk cops.  Poor city cops are trying to scrape a shoehorn into Giuliani's pocket to get some change out of it.  And meanwhile, like, you know, the Suffolk cops are going on caviar runs.  All right, I'll let you guys run.  Dunkin' Donuts are serving caviar.  Johnny, remember, this was all Anthony.  You guys suck, right?  And he still drives an SUV.  Ah, come on.  I'm kidding, man. 
[02:04:00]  Who's driving the yellow car?  That's right.  To be honest, Rick, go get him.  I'll keep my eyes out for that.  He's probably got a transvestite in the passenger seat.  I'll look at the slip and slide for that.  I think there's only one that drives in Suffolk County, and it's Rick.  Hey, he's in the Exit 52 parking ride.  Exit 52 slip and slide.  The slip and slide.  All right, take care.  Thank you, Johnny.  All right, take care.  Bye.  They used to suck, because I would have to go to the Exit 52 parking ride with my toolbox  and stuff to meet the guy that I was going to be doing the job with that day, you know, 
[02:04:30]  when I was a helper, doing tin knocking.  So I go there, park the car, you wait for the truck, and then you get out, and you try  to make a point of letting everyone there know that you're there to work.  Like, I make sure my toolbox is out.  I'm pretty much, I'm holding a hammer and a drill in my hand, and for them, it's like  sexual device anyway.  Hey, say, I can use that Makita.  See what goes on in that parking ride?  I never knew so many people were going to work at 2 in the morning when you're fast. 
[02:05:00]  Rick's checking in.  Oh, Jesus.  Rick's on jury duty this week.  Hey, Rick.  Yo.  Where are you?  I'm at Exit 52.  At the parking ride, though.  Dick.  In your Miata.  How was jury duty today?  Ah, I really can't talk about the case, guys.  Ah, look at you.  Shut up.  Tell us what happened.  Uh, let's see.  Um, got there at 9 o'clock.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:05:30]  Took about three naps, read two newspapers, took one huge dump.  Um, then finally got carted off to another building, and ever since then, we sat, and  uh, they've been, like, going through, it's called the Wadir.  What is that?  It's the Wadir.  Yeah.  Where they, uh, they start screening out who they want on the jury.  Oh, yeah.  You know, picking people, finding out if they got problems with it, or seeing who's been  arrested, or, you know.  So did you play your, um, Latin baseball song for them?  Uh, not yet.  I haven't been called up into the jury box yet. 
[02:06:00]  So how are you going to get out of jury duty?  I don't know.  Maybe be yourself, believe me.  Huh?  Just be yourself.  Be yourself.  They'll throw you right out.  Yeah, I figured that.  Either that, or just playing the baseball song.  Yeah.  So what, you got to go back tomorrow?  Got to go back tomorrow.  Oh, man.  It sucks.  So you just, you just wasted a whole day doing absolutely nothing.  Oh, yeah.  They, they pretty much kept us there.  Gave us two hours for lunch.  Who the hell needs two hours for lunch?  And then, uh, then we sat around while they questioned everybody. 
[02:06:30]  Can you just say, you know, I'm, uh, the producer of a really lame radio show, and I have to be there every day?  They haven't gotten to me yet.  That's the problem.  So you just go there and sit?  I just go there and sit and watch everybody else try and get out of it.  That would drive me nuts.  Actually, it's kind of funny, because, uh, I got a couple, uh, good ideas for people who want to get out of jury duty.  If you're Asian, just pretend you don't speak English.  Uh-huh.  Oh, is that what's going on?  One lady, she's like, oh, the broken English, it's like, okay, you're dismissed.  Rick, grow like a Clark Gable mustache, and they'll let you off, too. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, wear like a bandana on your head.  You think if I come in wearing colors?  Yeah, they'll let you go.  All right, cool.  You don't know what case it's for or anything?  Uh, yeah, it's like a burglary, robbery, armed.  Well, that could be kind of fun.  Yeah, it's kind of cool, actually.  Find out the color of the person, and then, uh, guilty or not guilty.  No, I'm kidding.  I think we all know.  Oh, my God.  That's just wrong.  Oh, my goodness.  What?  I didn't say what color ass is. 
[02:07:30]  Neither did I.  Just said it's wrong.  Why are you saying it so wrong?  Because no matter what color it is, you shouldn't judge based on somebody's color whether they're guilty or not.  Breaking and entering?  Um, let's see.  Robbery, burglary, armed.  They got...  Robbery is, uh, confronting somebody.  Yeah, you know, the whole thing.  All right, everyone in their car right now, what color do you think?  All right.  What, wait, what is this, from Manhattan, or...?  Uh, no, it's on Long Island.  Oh.  What, what town was it in? 
[02:08:00]  I don't know if I can say.  It's a sand.  Yeah, it's in Nassau County.  All right.  I don't know, I don't know where the, the whole thing took place, but I know it's like Nassau.  Yeah.  All right, I've changed my opinion now.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Rick, it's one of your kind.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  Look at that.  They might just throw you right out based on that.  Wow.  Am I right or wrong?  No, you're wrong.  Damn.  Oh, you know what the defendant, who it is, and what the race is? 
[02:08:30]  We get to sit there and look at him and everything.  Oh, you do?  Goddamn, that's pretty funny.  You get to look at him.  Hey, I might be judging you.  What's up, dude?  All right, Rick.  Let me just...  I just want to make sure he doesn't get a book.  Without, without, now, without giving out his race or anything, I'll just have to ask a couple of simple questions.  Asians don't break and enter. 
[02:09:00]  No, that's not breaking...  BNA can't be an Asian guy.  When's the last time you read a story about an Asian...  Asian guy.  ...breaking and entering?  It's up and coming.  It's up and coming.  Ching Wu was arrested, blaking and entering.  Blaking.  Okay.  All right, what questions can we ask him so that it really isn't answering, but we kind of know the race of the defendant?  Let's see.  Okay, would the defendant be more comfortable driving a 72 Caddy or an SUV? 
[02:09:30]  Um, hmm, both.  Wait a minute.  Both or both?  Both.  Both.  All right.  Um, okay, okay.  Would the defendant be more apt to be online at a Broadway show or the unemployment office? 
[02:10:00]  Hmm, good question.  I'd have to go unemployment.  Okay.  That's a white guy.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  It's a white guy.  Yeah.  Because it's either, it's either a white guy or a Hispanic.  Now, would you say...  It's not a Hispanic guy.  You're already wrong on that.  Well, I know.  So it's got to be a white guy.  When he robbed the people, would he say, um, would he ask them for their money or ax them for their money? 
[02:10:30]  You actually sound like one of the jurors today.  One of the guys who was being asked questions if you should be on the jury or not.  Well?  Um, let's see.  Hmm.  That's a pretty simple question there, right?  Yeah, it is.  All right.  He would ax them.  Oh, okay.  I think we have an answer.  All right.  That's it.  End of questioning.  You may step down.  Okay, Rick. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, shit.  Yeah, basically what Psycho Mark just said.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, Rick, have fun tomorrow at jury duty.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be a blast.  Have fun being actually thrown into jail for some type of contempt for even talking to us, you asked.  No.  Yeah, you gave away a little too much info there, Pally.  No, I didn't.  Sure you did.  I didn't tell you anything.  What did they tell you when you left? 
[02:11:30]  Not to discuss the case with anyone.  Especially two million people.  All right, Rick.  We're going to let you go.  Bye.  All right.  Bye-bye.  The soon-to-be-incarcerated Rick.  Opie and Anthony.  Those guys are lightweights.  I can drink them both under the table.  Hey, this is Jim Brewer, and I've been up since, like, oh, I don't know, yesterday. 
[02:12:00]  And the only thing that gets me going, Hammer, is Opie and Anthony.  I'm talking 1027.  N-E-W, Hammer, I'm going to pee.  Goddamn Brewer, man.  I miss Brewer.  He's a rip.  That voice cracks me up every time.  Remember yesterday we had a kid that needed some questions to ask his sex ed teacher? 
[02:12:30]  Yes.  Well, he's checking in to let us know how his class was today.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Okay, you're never going to believe what happened.  I'll just get right into the story.  She's about to write something on the board, and before she turns around to start writing,  she says, okay, I'll take some questions.  I raise my hand, and she goes, Scott.  Turns around, starts writing.  I take a second to ask a question.  Then I finally go, uh, yeah, does the vagina have teeth?  She stops right in the middle of a word, turns around, and looks at me like I have a dildo going out of the side of my head. 
[02:13:00]  It was so funny.  Did the class laugh at you?  Uh, well, all the girls in my class started laughing.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, they were giggling, but, uh, my friend that listens to you, he was laughing like crazy, because he listens to you guys and heard me on the radio the other day.  See, this has been a dream of mine.  We can still affect school classes years after being in school, Opie.  Mm-hmm.  We can still disrupt the classroom. 
[02:13:30]  Now, did the teacher answer your question, Scott?  No, uh, my English teacher was in the room.  Yeah.  And, uh, she looked at her, and then, uh, she points to the door, and she wants to, so that obviously means she wants to talk to me outside.  Yes.  I go outside.  I end up missing, like, recess for two months.  But it's well worth it.  Ah, but she didn't even answer your question.  I know, but I already knew the answer.  I'm not that stupid.  Yes, the answer is yes, the vagina does indeed have teeth.  I sent you guys a fax. 
[02:14:00]  I got, uh, these wacky papers in school.  Yeah.  And then there was the same thing, uh, that I told you about with, uh, girls sitting down with their legs open.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I was hoping you'd mention it on there, but I didn't hear it.  I'll try to send it to you tomorrow.  I still have it.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  All right.  Okay.  There you go, Scott.  Junior high school kid sending us porn.  That's, that's great.  And Al, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Figured I'd weigh in real quick with the Diallo thing.  And Al, it's pretty funny.  You just played the Jim Brewer bit.  Uh, unless I'm misinformed, I think Jim's brother is a cop, and I work with him at my precinct. 
[02:14:30]  Okay.  Small world.  Uh, yeah, the whole, the whole public perception and the way they treat us, it probably led to the most unprofessional moment of my career yesterday.  Uh, walking a foot post, you know, just minding my own business.  Some guy is totally parked somewhere that is completely effing up traffic beyond all capacity.  So I bang, the guy summons.  And, uh, a guy's walking by.  It's not even his car.  And he goes, well, I bet you don't write summonses in your own name, but I guess this is a big game to you.  I'm like, well, guy, I'm just doing my job.  This guy's on a bad spot.  He goes, BS, blah, blah, blah, you're all a bunch of a-holes. 
[02:15:00]  And I'm thinking, uh, I got to take this, you know, I have to watch the news and the protesters screaming in the cop's face.  I go, all right, listen.  I go, uh, you know, I'm just doing my job, man.  Don't get on my case like that.  He goes, F you.  F you.  I'm in uniform.  I'm just on a street corner.  He goes, F you.  I go, F you.  Give it right back to him.  Now, the little voice in the back, I was like, dude, calm down.  Dude, calm down.  Calm down.  And he goes, you know what?  I'm going to kick your ass.  He says that to you?  He says that to me.  Did you tune him up?  Well, here it is.  That was like a group of like 50 people gathering around me. 
[02:15:30]  I take my hat off.  I mean, literally, I wasn't even thinking clearly.  I get mad just telling the story.  Dude, I was pissed for like three hours just today.  I take my hat off.  I take my shades off.  I sit on a payphone.  I'm like, here's your chance, guy.  Here's your chance to make a statement.  I go, I start yelling.  I'm like, you just started to kick my ass in front of 50 people.  Now, come on.  He goes, you still got a gun, don't you?  I slide the magazine out of my gun.  It's sticking in my pocket.  Turn my radio off.  I go, there you go.  I ain't calling for help.  I ain't going to shoot you.  And here's your big chance, man.  You talk the talk. 
[02:16:00]  Now, walk the walk.  Now, the guy's standing there dumbfounded because he basically, I think he expected me to turn  around and walk away.  He stands there for like 15, 20 seconds.  And I think if you guys remember what my appearance was from the end of the Hooters drink fest.  I was that big guy with a shaved head that hung out with you guys.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Who's going to mess with you, man?  Well, this guy, he looked mid-40s, and I guess he was trying to make his big social statement  or something.  But he stands there not saying anything.  I go, that's what I thought, you effing coward.  I mean, totally non-professional.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, that's kind of against department policy, I think.  Hey, I'm glad you stood your ground, man.  Yeah, well, he goes, well, I'll see you next time.  I go, you come see me when you grow some hair and your genitalia, man.  The whole crowd starts going, oh, jeez, man.  I'll slap it in with like thighs and stuff.  I just walked off, and the guy was yelling, man.  But I was like, you know, growing up, I'd be deathly afraid to say anything like that  to a cop.  Yeah.  This guy just jumped right on my case, man.  Big F you, I'll kick your ass right in my face.  All right, Al.  Guys, have a great day. 
[02:17:00]  You too.  See ya.  Good story.  Thank you.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, you're next on NAW.  Hey, what's up, Al?  What's up, Anthony?  Hey.  Hey, I got a question for Opie.  I think, I mean, you guys are really great supporting us.  You know, cops, great job.  Well, when Opie said that, the four cops should...  Well, I was just trying to start a conversation, because I really wanted to know what you guys  were thinking.  I guess I didn't really explain it, you know, the right way.  It seems to me that, logically, it seems that that might be best for you guys, and that's 
[02:17:30]  why I suggested it, that's all.  No, you know, everyone's got their opinions.  I mean, you got yours, but...  And I'll be the first to admit that I'm wrong, because all the cops that we talked to, not  one of them said that they should step down, so I was definitely wrong.  But I was just trying to start a conversation about it.  I am.  It's like the guy was saying before, like, with the grease man, like, he's so stupid, you  know, crap all the time.  Why don't I do that?  A little zero.  No, no, no.  But, yeah, you know, I mean, you don't take that, you know, to heart yourself.  You know, you just, you know, you go on. 
[02:18:00]  Right.  Also, I got another question.  A couple of days ago, you guys talked about the Flyers and the Islander game, and no support  or whatever.  Oh, yeah, it pisses me off.  So, we were at that game.  We were at about 20 cops.  We went to that game.  Bro, it was great, man.  It was a whole bunch of Philly cops were behind us, and there was a whole lot of chances of  not guilty were going on at the game.  Wow.  It was pretty good.  Cool, Joe.  It was an eight-year-old kid, too.  I had a nice, good wow sign going over there.  Yeah, I hear there's a lot of wow signs at the Islander games. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, there were.  Well, thank you, Joe.  All right.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Peace.  Bye.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  Thanks for supporting us, but you know how you look at it.  Are you guys working tonight?  Listen, what happened was a real tragedy.  Those poor guys that they've got to go through, their lives are never going to be the same again.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just a sick thing.  You've got to figure having a family and then just, you know, going through all that and putting  your family through that.  And, of course, the news is going to see if I was one of the cops and he's going into his 
[02:19:00]  house and he's got his daughter right next to him and they take a picture.  Yeah.  Now, they got, you know, that's wrong.  You know, the papers aren't outright hate us and it's just terrible.  You know, you've got guys going out there cleaning up society's ills and here are these  guys, you know, we're looking for a guy who had a rape, a pattern of rapes and not only  that, he killed a couple of people and there's this guy who looked, you know, looked like him.  They're just going to question him and what happened, what happened, but it's just terrible.  So, you know, you want us to go out there, do a job, you know, unfortunately they're going 
[02:19:30]  to be casualty sometimes, you know, what happened, it's just real terrible.  But the bottom line is, is you want the cops out there doing their job, you've got to be  supportive of them.  I would love to see the outrage the next time, God forbid, one of you guys goes down.  You don't see the same outrage.  It drives me nuts.  Almost happened two weeks ago in Crown Heights, a 7-1 precinct.  A lady was getting robbed at gunpoint in a hallway of her home and she was fighting off 
[02:20:00]  the attacker and it spilled out into the street.  He took off with her handbag.  He had a 9mm handgun.  He ran down two blocks.  She ran after the guy.  What had happened was is that the officers had an arrest in the car.  They were coming from the, you know, wherever the arrest was.  They were going to the station house to process the arrest.  And what happened was is that the lady spotted the van and she was pointing to the officers  and she told them what happened.  They gave chase.  They pulled up in a van behind the perpetrator. 
[02:20:30]  The perpetrator spun around with a 9mm to fire at them, but the gun locked up.  And what happened was the guy dropped the gun and he ran and, you know, and they caught  up to him.  Yeah.  But, you know, they didn't know the gun was going to lock up.  Right.  In an act of God, that had happened.  But the van was in the chamber and it locked up.  Wow.  So you don't hear that.  That's not front page news.  Right.  You know, that got like page six of the news.  Right.  You know, and these guys shot a lot of his strength.  And the officers, you know, who actually did that, did this, the aisle thing was in the  back of their minds.  And they said, you know, we were thinking about that and, you know, we were just glad. 
[02:21:00]  And the people were just screaming in the street.  The lady was, what, don't shoot, don't shoot, man, what are you doing?  And, you know, there's going to get somebody hurt.  It's going to get somebody killed.  And you're not going to see any marches and protests about him.  I'll have a chance.  I'll have a chance.  Right.  There you go, Frank.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Well, it's just, what happened?  I was playing a little ping pong.  It must be the cold medicine.  You're crazy, man.  All right.  We've got to get the other side on the air. 
[02:21:30]  We don't have to, but Vanjie.  Yes.  How are you doing, guys?  All right, Vanjie.  What's up?  Listen, like, you guys, well, maybe it's just not you.  It's just everything.  You know, they're not talking about the case in Borough Park, because those four officers  were also acquitted.  But that, nobody's even talking about that.  You know, with that guy with the wielding the hammer that got shot.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  And they were all acquitted.  Uh-huh.  So, why don't you talk about that?  Well, I didn't even realize they got acquitted, and how long ago was that now? 
[02:22:00]  It was just last summer, you know, just like the hour last year.  Right.  Well, I think the cops in that shooting should have been acquitted as well.  Uh-huh.  A lunatic with a hammer, you don't know what the hell he's going to do.  That's true.  That's true.  I mean, you don't see that?  They don't see what?  You know, as far as, like, what...  What, what, what, what, Vanjie, what did you think should happen to the cops in that case?  Maybe reckless endangerment, like...  No way, man. 
[02:22:30]  You got a lunatic...  Okay, but, like, listen...  You got a lunatic with a hammer.  You don't know what the guy's going to do, okay?  What if he started crushing the skull of a baby right there?  Uh-huh.  There was a, there was a bunch of people around.  Yeah.  The cops have to make a decision at that point.  Oh, but...  He had a weapon, and, and it was obvious he was, he was going to use it.  So nobody could have jumped him from behind, huh?  That's not the way they do it.  Oh, I see.  Oh, okay.  I'm sure that, you know, they, they try sometimes, but, you know, they, they have to make judgment calls.  Oh. 
[02:23:00]  You got a guy running around with a hammer, threatening to, to, you know, use it.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  What if it was your, what if it was your kid there, and all of a sudden the guy's going...  I don't have a kid.  Well, I'm just saying, let's, let's think about it.  Yeah.  It's someone you know, and this guy's attacking someone you, uh, you love with the hammer.  Well, I just feel bad anybody, whatever happens, has to be shot and killed like that.  Well, it's, it's always...  Maybe wounded.  It's, it's always a tragedy, but in that case, I, I honestly think the officers should  have been acquitted.  Oh. 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  That's, I, that's my God's honest opinion.  I don't know what to tell you.  Okay.  But to change the subject, when are you guys going to come to Harlem and do a broadcast?  Oh.  Well, we got to, we got to like, uh, calm everyone down before we can try to...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Before we try to do that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  I'm just having a tough time getting to the subway these days, and it's only a couple blocks.  You know, nothing happened up here.  Some guy, some old, um, animal nozzle called me last week and said, oh, I'm, you know, I'm 
[02:24:00]  trying to get uptown, and they got cops all over it.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  You know, I went outside, and it was just business as usual.  White folks walking around, black folks walking around.  Everybody going about their business.  Is everyone sad up there still?  Is there, like, a sense of outrage?  Not that I...  Well, see, that happened in the Bronx.  No, I mean...  Yeah, I know that.  But, um...  The problem's a whole different animal, but...  But, see, nothing, you know, I mean, I live right here in the heart of everything, and  nothing's happening.  Right.  So, I just want to know when you're...  Fangy, do you like, do you like the cops? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, they're okay.  They never did anything to me.  Well, um, yeah, I like them.  Yeah.  They've been helpful.  All right.  I mean, just because I'm black, I wouldn't like them?  No, I'm just asking, because you're in Harlem, and, you know, no, it's not a black-white thing.  Oh, no, let me know, okay?  They're people just like I am.  You know, a lot of people ask, why do you guys support the cops so much?  And let me tell you why.  Like, Aunt and I were born and raised, you know, in the tri-state area.  Mm-hmm.  I went away for a while to do radio. 
[02:25:00]  Went away?  Oh, I thought you meant the big house.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  And before I left, I mean, I swear to you, it was, the city was a real dangerous place.  Oh.  And when I came back, it was a completely different city.  Completely different.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  And it's not just the mayor.  You know, the cops are out there.  You're not out there, don't you?  The cops are out there, and I just feel so much safer walking around.  Safer from who?  I mean, like, who's going to bother?  Oh, my God.  Being a white kid from Long Island, when we used to take our trips to the city, this was a dangerous place. 
[02:25:30]  Swear to you.  You didn't want to end up in the bad part of town, and the bad part of town wasn't, you know, a place where nice people were walking around.  You knew where the bad parts of town were.  No.  There was a lot of bad parts of town.  There were a lot more of them.  But see, listen, I've walked in white neighborhoods, and I've never felt threatened.  And, you know, I mean, see, the thing is that if you walk around, if you walk around, wait, wait, wait, wait, that's a silly analogy. 
[02:26:00]  Do you honestly think black people feel threatened in general in white neighborhoods?  But see, the thing is what I'm saying is that.  I'm just asking because I have no clue.  I don't know.  I'm sure there's the occasional racially motivated crime against black people that are in the white neighborhoods.  We've heard them before on the news.  Yeah.  It's happened.  But, I don't know, let's see.  Take a black person and let them walk around maybe, I don't know, a great neck, you know?  Mm-hmm.  So, I would go to a great neck and walk around. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  But then take a white guy and let's put them, I don't know, bedside.  Red hook, that's pretty right.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay, that's good.  I wouldn't even walk around red hook.  Now, it's 2 in the morning, maybe 3 in the morning.  You're walking around.  Who is in more danger?  Well, I think, well, walking around 2 in the morning by yourself, you know, anybody could be in danger.  Right.  Who would be in more danger?  I don't know.  I'd have to go with the white person. 
[02:27:00]  Well, you know what?  I would say a female would be in more danger whether she was black or white.  I wouldn't even say a man, you know?  Ah, right.  I'm just saying some areas are a little more dangerous than others.  That's known.  That's a fact.  That's true.  There's more crime in certain areas than other areas.  It just happens.  Vanjie, a cop wants to talk to you.  Okay.  Hey, Joe?  Yeah.  Hey, Joe.  Wait, wait, wait, Joe.  Before you start, believe it or not, Vanjie's kind of a friend of the show, so try to keep it on the up and up. 
[02:27:30]  I know you want to, like, strangle her, but, Joe, go ahead.  Talk to Vanjie.  How do you explain that a hammer isn't a weapon?  If a guy has a weapon up in the air and he's going to hit somebody with it, you expect a cop to jump 10 feet and then tackle him?  Well, I said something with him, Joe.  Or just point the gun at him and shoot him.  I mean, what's going to save the person's life?  Trying to, oh, well, you know, I couldn't jump 10 feet and I'm sorry, well, now you're dead, but if I would have shot you, I know I would have stopped you from killing somebody. 
[02:28:00]  I mean, I'm going to shot him in the knee or something.  They don't train us to do that.  You are supposed to shoot to kill.  That's it.  If you're going to shoot to stop somebody from taking someone's life or the life of another, you know, they're trained to shoot to kill.  That's what?  That's what we're trained for.  It's a big target.  Oh, I just thought maybe someone could have circled behind him and tackled him.  It's not a movie, you know, they don't circle behind, yeah, you flank, do a flanking maneuver. 
[02:28:30]  No, you pull your gun out, you shoot him.  It takes a lot for a cop to pull out a gun, first of all.  No, I know.  And if they're going to pull out their gun, if they're going to pull out the gun, they can't fool around.  I know.  They have made a serious decision that's probably going to affect them for the rest of their lives as well.  Absolutely.  Okay, Joe, I don't have a problem with you.  I just was very offended that you thought that we could have done something else.  Well, please, Joe, don't be offended.  And I wasn't even there, you know, and I'm just going by what, you know, everyone else heard in the public of what happened in the thing. 
[02:29:00]  The guy had his arm up in the air with the hammer and he was about to strike somebody.  Yeah.  Okay.  And, you know, and from that scenario, I would have shot the guy.  Okay, Joe, where are you a cop?  In New Jersey.  Where?  In New Jersey.  In New Jersey.  Oh, Jersey.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Well, you weren't there either, were you?  No, I just said that.  We're all going on what we know from reading about it, Vanjie.  Oh, mm-hmm.  Just like you.  You weren't there either, right?  No.  You made your decision on what you read and so am I and so is Joe, obviously. 
[02:29:30]  Mm-hmm.  Well, I mean, you know.  The guy was a raging lunatic, you know, when that all went down.  Yeah.  God knows what he was going to do with the hammer.  Oh.  And I'm sure the cops said a few times, you know, put the damn hammer down.  Yeah, they did say that.  But what do you think he was going to do?  Sell it like sore or something?  I don't know.  I just thought you should rethink things before you say something like that.  Vanjie, in all honesty, I think you could kill a person with a hammer pretty easily.  Oh, sure you could.  Pretty easily.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:30:00]  You know?  But, I mean, you can kill a person with a gun faster.  Yeah, but it's not about that.  Oh.  You don't let the guy loose, you know, he's a stark-raving lunatic, loose on the streets  with a hammer.  Someone's going to get hurt.  That's true.  The whole thing, that...  And it doesn't take, you know, much to kill somebody.  One strike could pretty much do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you hit him in the right place.  If you hit him right in the top of the head or anywhere in the head, you're going to kill  him.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  All right.  All right, Joe.  Well, I'm sorry if I offended you, okay? 
[02:30:30]  All right, Joe.  That's all right, Vanjie.  You offend someone.  I mean, you know, that's what you believe, and that's fine.  That's why we're trying to discuss this.  No, I mean, I'm just saying that it's unfortunate that, I don't know, these kind of crazy things  happen, and I think that some people sort of overreact a little bit.  Well, you know, there's fear.  There's a little panic.  You know, there's tragedies that take place, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Well, anyway, like I said, wait till the trouble dies down and come and do a broadcast here 
[02:31:00]  in Harlem.  We're still into doing a broadcast in Harlem.  Oh, great.  All right.  We did promise to do one first, though, on Venus.  We have to do that first, but right after the Venus broadcast, we're coming on.  And then Mars, and then our city.  Oh, yeah, Mars, too, yeah.  I think we're about 20 years away from being able to get to Venus.  Yes.  Well, how about just some place in Manhattan?  Somewhere in the year 2021, we'll be in Harlem.  Right after the temperature in hell reaches 32 degrees. 
[02:31:30]  Right.  Wait, what's just some place in Manhattan that I can get to?  They don't have to take their Long Island railroads and stuff.  Just any place down the village or something.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Well, thank you, Vanjie.  Okay, you guys take care.  All right, bye.  All right, bye.  Okay, we've got to take a break, Anthony.  All righty.  We want to thank Vanjie for checking in.  Yes, it's always good to get up all sides of a story.  You guys have to cheer you ready.  It's beyond belief right now.  Please. 
[02:32:00]  I'll be in the end of the show.  Thank you.  1027 WNAW.  Hey, it's Joe Piscopo.  I'm 1027.  As the chairman of the board might say, Opie and Anthony, you are two groovy cats.  I love you, baby.  You knock me out.  Wonderful.  Marvelous.  Beautiful.  Cuckoo.  Wonderful.  Cuckoo.  He wouldn't say that because he's dead.  Frank Sinatra's dead.  1027 WNAW.  It's the ONA Show.  Let's go to Tracy.  Tracy, you're next on NAW. 
[02:32:30]  Hey, ONA.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  Let me tell you.  As much as I love you guys, you discriminate against the sexes.  How?  In what way?  A couple of days.  I don't remember what day, but a girl, 16, called about a lesbian thing.  Yeah.  And you went and talked to her, but yet you talked to all the 12-year-old boys in the world.  Yeah, you did.  You guys talked to too many little boys.  Let's see.  Why?  Which is a faggy.  No, okay.  No, I can actually explain that.  Okay, go ahead.  Because as a guy, when we were growing up and we were that age, we were going through the 
[02:33:00]  same stuff so you could almost relate more.  You can talk.  You know what's appropriate because you know what's on their minds because you went on  through the same thing.  Now, a girl, it's kind of like we're the older brothers type of thing.  You know what I mean?  That's what it is.  But if we talk to a girl like that, it's going to be like, oh, my God, you're a frigging  pervert.  Right.  If you talk to a kid like that, it's like, yeah, like an older brother.  Tracy, you're right.  It's a fine line.  I mean, we could get in a lot of trouble talking about sex with underage people in general. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, you should see the trouble you get in for having sex with the underage.  Never mind talking.  Yeah, I know.  17 will get to 20.  I know.  Well, we're just trying to do the best we can here.  Okay.  I still love you guys.  Well, thank you, Tracy.  All right.  Hi, Cesar and Raul.  See you guys later.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Mike.  Cesar and Raul.  Raul.  Mike, what's up?  Yeah, 1-1-8.  Hey.  Another cop checking in.  That's it, bro.  The cop showed today.  I know.  You guys are making this show way too serious today. 
[02:34:00]  No, no.  I just want to pass along some information.  Yeah.  Venge was on the phone talking about couldn't you sneak around the guy?  Couldn't you jump on him?  It's proven statistically that a guy with a knife 10 feet away from you, which is not a very big distance,  he comes after you with a knife, you're a dead man, even if you have a gun on your side,  because you don't have the chance to react that fast.  I would like these people to walk a mile in our shoes for once, you know, and see, like 
[02:34:30]  you said, cops don't just pull their guns out arbitrarily, you know.  I mean, it's a major decision, but it's something that's going to change everybody's lives when  it happens, and they think we're just like whipping out our guns, and it's like the OK  Corral every time we come up against somebody, you know.  Yeah.  I'd like to hear a little more gunfire in the city, to tell you the truth.  Well, I'm a cop in Jersey, so I'm not in New York all the time, but when I come in, you're  damn right I got a gun on my hip. 
[02:35:00]  All right.  But anyway, long time listener, love you guys.  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Hey, can we get the psychopaths in here, Mark?  Why are you filming me, man?  I know, I look like crap.  Whatever, I look like a fag.  Care?  How would you know what a fag looks like, Mark?  I love one.  Hey, we got two guys, two more psychopaths in the studio.  Brought some, what's in that brown paper bag?  Present. 
[02:35:30]  Can I unveil the present?  Yeah, you can unveil the present.  Something tells me it's shaped like beer.  Anthony, you can't have this today because you're sick.  What is that?  Oh, some candy.  Look at you.  We only get the best for you guys.  Very nice.  Thank you.  We were told we were going to get hooked up with prizes and we didn't want to bring anything.  That'll be kind of cool, though, for my cough, I think, right?  Yes.  Soothe.  That'll soothe.  Coat the throat a little bit.  Very good.  Thank you.  Well, we award the psychopaths.  These are the guys that were on Channel 7 last night.  We brought a sign.  Yes.  Let me see the sign. 
[02:36:00]  I want to make sure it was you guys.  Definitely.  That was the sign we saw on TV.  Oh, yeah.  You guys, you got to get smaller signs, though.  Only like the W and half the O was on TV.  This thing's like 20 feet long, this side.  In the back, we're primary colors.  We couldn't sell it on eBay, so we made a sign out of it.  No, you guys were little stars, TV stars last night.  Yeah, we're great.  They're old.  And we definitely appreciate it.  And if you guys get on TV with the wow sign, we invite you down here and we give you a ton 
[02:36:30]  of stuff for doing it.  Yeah, a little tour of the studio.  Right.  And a couple of valuable prizes.  Right.  And we were hanging out with Spad.  We have a lot more respect for him now.  Oh, really?  Well, that goes away.  It's amazing.  He works hard.  You know, people don't think so, but he does.  Hey, Stinky, what's your name?  Who do you want to talk about?  Okay, please hold.  Well, it's Spad.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.  No, F-O.  Get a pen.  What's the matter with you? 
[02:37:00]  Hey, Stinky, my new employee.  Go to Associating.  Get Anthony Hammett's wish.  I'm a hero.  I'm delegating responsibility, and I don't even know what that means.  Well, what's your names?  We should get your names on the radio.  My name's Kevin.  Hey, Kevin.  What's up, Glenn?  Hey, Glenn.  Yeah.  Well, thanks for helping out the show.  We appreciate it.  Yeah.  We blew off all our jobs to come in.  Oh, really?  Yeah, definitely.  As long as we say them and stuff.  Yeah, go ahead.  Say whatever you want.  I work at a local paper called the Montclairian in Montclair.  That's how I happen to be.  The Montclairian.  Yeah. 
[02:37:30]  What do you do there?  I'm the advertising director.  Cub reporter?  No.  He's got a little Pat that walks around all day.  Yeah, like Jimmy Olsen.  I also work at Time Warp Comics in Cedar Grove.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  Like a comic book store?  Yeah, a great comic book store.  All right.  I've got a problem.  I've just got a problem.  Any guy that works in a comic book store always looks like a kid toucher.  I work there one day a week just to get my own books. 
[02:38:00]  I've got Pokemon, honey.  You get over here.  Yeah.  That's in the back room.  Yeah.  Oh, there's a special section in the back.  I'm a waiter at Bennigan's in Parsippany.  All right.  And a student at actually the school that we're on TV at Montclair.  Bennigan's.  Montclair, yeah.  You have plenty of flair on your uniform?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  We're not like Fridays and all over the place.  Yeah, you don't want your buttons and stuff?  And stuff, no.  I like that.  So, thanks for having us.  You should just have a button that says, like, twat on there, you know? 
[02:38:30]  And just come out, like, mixed in with all the cute little buttons that people wear when they work.  Like Fridays and stuff.  Just a big one that says, twat.  Yeah.  All right.  Try that.  I wear the one name tag that says just my name on it, but everything else is just whatever.  We're also directors in Durang One Act Festival downtown in April.  All right.  It's at the New York Comedy Club first and second weeks in April.  Cool, man?  Yeah.  Yeah, One Act. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  Cool.  Yeah.  Well, we want to thank you guys for coming by.  We appreciate it.  You've got to follow this guy.  He's going to, like, completely hook you up with stuff.  Right.  You can hang for the rest of the show, all right?  Great.  Thanks so much for having us in.  All right, man.  We appreciate it.  Thanks, guys.  Enjoy the beer.  Thank you.  We will.  Enjoy the beer.  We always do.  Anthony, you know who else is here?  Remember, make Bridget cry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bridget is here?  Bring her in, man.  Where's Bridget?  Here, give her that mic over there.  Wow.  Wow, Bridget.  Whoa.  Hey, Bridget. 
[02:39:30]  Are you weepy today?  I was.  Were you?  Well, let's get everyone up to speed.  Bridget called her show, what, three, four months ago now?  Not that long.  Was it that long ago?  Like three months ago?  Yeah, about three months ago.  All right.  Wow, time flies.  Do you want to tell the story again?  No.  See, she's ready to cry.  You're an emotional girl.  Just tell the story again.  It'll sound better coming from you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  See, we didn't think you were for real.  Now that I see you in our studio, you're definitely for real. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, my God.  I feel bad for her.  I was going out with a guy for about a year, and it was.  Oh, before you start?  Yeah.  Could someone get me the megaphone?  Okay, go ahead.  Oh, no.  Spaz, get the megaphone.  I thought Tyson was sick today.  This is too good.  Okay.  No, I'll be nice.  Go ahead.  How did that story go? 
[02:40:30]  Going out with a guy for a year.  How old are you, Bridget?  I'm 20 today.  20 today?  It's her birthday.  It's my birthday.  That's why I came here.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  I'm going to continue your story.  What happened?  You know, I'm usually not into redheads, but you're definitely cute.  I'm into redheads.  You're a redhead.  I don't know.  That's why I'm not into redheads.  It's so hard.  That's exactly.  But go ahead.  Okay, Bridget, your story.  Bridget.  B-Y. 
[02:41:00]  20 years old today.  All right.  Right.  And I hadn't done anything really with him.  This was a guy you really, really liked, right?  Yeah.  Like you still like him now?  No.  Oh, no.  You sure?  I'm sure.  Okay.  There's a bunch of guys that want to play Make Bridget Cry on the line already.  What happened, Bridget?  Okay, so you were really into this guy at the time.  I called here because I wanted to do something nice for him for his birthday.  Right.  And Anthony was kind enough to give me some instructions.  Well, he kind of suggested that your hob is not. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  Anthony's a frigging pervert.  All right.  And so I did.  And the instructions were very good.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, we even gave you step-by-step how to go about it, right?  Which was very useful.  Okay.  And I got to the end and he freaked out.  All right.  But this was the first time you ever gave a homer, right?  Right.  Okay.  And he freaked out when you were done?  He freaked out.  Uh-huh.  And he called me a whore. 
[02:42:00]  He called you a whore.  And then what did he do?  And then very much in Iron Mike style, he threw me backwards.  Walked out.  And that was it.  Threw you backwards and called you a whore.  Well, that's despicable.  I can't believe this guy.  What a whore.  He.  I would like to punch him.  He called you a whore and pushed you.  And didn't even punch you. 
[02:42:30]  What was in the universe?  What kind of man is that?  Shut up.  So then you called up Opie and Anthony and started.  My boyfriend called me a whore and pushed me down.  Well, you know something?  You're a whore.  What are you doing?  Putting that in your mouth.  You don't know where it's been.  Shut up.  So you like doing that kind of thing? 
[02:43:00]  Why don't you come over to Iron Mike, pull down the fly, and unleash 10 inches of Louisiana  Black Snake.  It's got a mind of its own.  All right, listen.  It'll call you a whore and push you.  All by itself.  It's easier to do this when she's on the phone.  She really looks like she's trying to cry.  Come on.  I'm working on it.  I'm okay.  Wait, there's part two to this story now, Anthony and Mike.  Baby, baby, stick your head in gravy. 
[02:43:30]  Wash your awful bubble gum and punch you in through the wrist.  Oh, crap.  She's laughing.  She was supposed to be here at 430.  So, Bridget, what happened?  I missed my exit for the tunnel, and I took the George Washington instead, which I thought  would be fine, even though I'd seen New York pass a while before that.  And so I figured once I took the George Washington, I could just hop on a road and...  Get on that mic a little closer.  Make believe it's your boyfriend.  No, I mean, you can't really hear.  You just missed a great part of the story. 
[02:44:00]  A lot of people are going, oh, my God.  She was on the George Washington.  Yeah.  And figured, I'll just turn off anywhere and find my way to the station.  Oops.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So, I realized it was kind of a bad neighborhood.  The default road anywhere leads you to the bad neighborhood.  When you get lost in New York, you will always end up in a bad neighborhood.  Right.  Which I thought was fine, but it just kept getting a little worse.  Yeah. 
[02:44:30]  And then I stopped seeing street signs because they were all torn down.  Translation.  Uh-uh.  Doctor.  At which point I called you guys.  Yeah.  For help.  And, uh, hey, was it Kevin?  Spazzy?  Spazzy.  I'll help.  I'll talk in.  It's good.  I'll talk in.  And?  And he's saying...  Drive until you don't see any more black people.  That's my help.  Were you really scared?  I was pretty scared, yep.  People kept walking up to the car every time I stopped at a red light.  Yeah. 
[02:45:00]  Wow.  What'd they want?  I don't know.  I ran a couple red lights.  I got really scared.  You ran red lights.  That's good.  Very good.  You learned very quick.  That's what we do.  Yeah.  Wow.  But then I got here.  It was okay.  Yeah.  You're okay now?  I'm okay now.  You have a boyfriend now or anything?  No.  No?  Do you want one?  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.  Just one try and see what your mindset is here.  Would you like to play a quick round of Make Bridget Cry?  I mean, they're all waiting.  Sure.  Oh, no.  Are you serious? 
[02:45:30]  No, sure.  All right.  I don't think I'll cry.  All right.  Let's take a quick break, and we're going to play another round of Make Bridget Cry.  They're all waiting.  We'll be back in a couple minutes.  Stay there.  You can hide some conflict.  Piss me off, okay?  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Hey, Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street, the heart of Little Italy.  We love it.  I'm going to.  I was going to go tonight, but I'm feeling a little under the weather. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  But I think I'm probably going tomorrow.  Yeah.  I've been there in a couple of weeks.  I love Paisanos.  I get the fried ravioli appetizer, and then I'll get, like, a stuffed veal or the pasta  with the meat sauce.  See, now I've got to go tonight, maybe.  I'm starving, and I love Paisano.  Great atmosphere.  And they take care of you.  Service.  Fantastic.  Place for a date or to take the family.  Paisano.  And I think Joey's going to be a father, like, any day at this point. 
[02:46:30]  He might be a father as we speak.  Really?  Yeah.  I hope we find out.  An heir to the Paisano throne.  That's right.  And if you do go to Paisano, don't forget to ask for Joey, the owner.  Tell him Opie and Anthony sent you.  He will give you a glass of wine on the house, okay?  Yes.  We've turned on a lot of people to Paisano, and everyone has a great, great time down there.  All right.  Paisano, Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Give them a call for reservations, 965-1188. 
[02:47:00]  That's 965-1188 for Paisano.  A gigantic loom box is coming down the street.  Hand me the RPG-7.  In the studio this afternoon, Bridget, the famous Bridget from Make Bridget Cry.  She wants to play a round of Make Bridget Cry for her 20th birthday. 
[02:47:30]  We did ask her.  A bunch of our listeners want to play What's in Bridget's Pants as well.  Oh, really?  Are you willing to play What's in Bridget's Pants?  Like they guess?  Huh?  Like they guess?  Yeah.  We guess.  What are the choices?  Triangle, Mohawk, Hitler mustache, and Wood Floor.  Well, we've got to get her on the phone. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, call up a...  Oh, no, no, I don't want to do it with the phone.  Oh, oh.  How do you want to do it?  I thought you were just going to get her.  I mean, she was just going to get her.  Well, we need to, like, you know, hear something so we can make an educated guess.  Yeah.  More of a clue, kind of a hint thing, you know.  No one will be in the room with you.  No?  No.  I bet whatever it is, it's fiery red, though, right?  Fire in the hole.  Right?  Yeah, got to be. 
[02:48:30]  Of course.  Yes.  All right, set her up on the phone.  You have her word, you'll have complete privacy.  We won't.  We won't peek.  Except for the hidden camera in the drop ceiling.  Yeah, right.  She's going into the J. Moore suite.  We're going to have to install the hidden camera.  Yep.  Any room is the J. Moore suite.  Oh, yeah.  She's a hot little number, what?  What do you say, Mark?  Nothing.  I bet that phone's going to smell good. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, Jesus, Mark.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  I bet she can drink.  Well, she's Irish.  That's what I mean.  All right, let's see.  Hello, hello, hello.  Oh?  Yeah.  All right, I'm in Mark's studio.  All right, Spaz, thank you very much.  I'm having your phone.  All right.  Spaz, guard the door so she feels safe.  I will block the door.  Okay.  Okay.  Bridget's very hot, 19.  Not an ounce of body fat. 
[02:49:30]  I'm 20.  I'm 20 today.  It's your 20th birthday.  Wow, it talks.  Oh, I thought you had the phone down there already.  Very tight body, tight abs, nice little boobies.  What size are you?  What?  What size are your boobs?  34 B.  Yeah, they're nice B's.  Okay.  What?  Spaz, it's right in front of the door.  Yeah, but Spaz, turn away, God damn.  Yes, he's turned away.  Oh, well, then don't worry about it.  You sure?  He doesn't have eyes in the back of his head.  Did you lock the door from your side?  I, I, well, he's standing right in front of it. 
[02:50:00]  They'd have to move him.  Honestly, Spaz is not going to move.  If we tell him not to move, he won't move.  Okay.  You've got to believe us.  So, so, uh, you've got a, you've got a cute little skirt on.  Okay, hold on.  What kind of, well, what kind of panties you got on?  Um, it's a thong.  Wow, look at that.  Rock.  Okay.  Okay, hold on.  Ready?  All right, are we playing the game now?  What's in Bridget's pants?  We're playing it.  I really like you guys to be doing this, I have to say.  Okay, okay, ready?  What, you want us to do it?  No, no, no. 
[02:50:30]  No, I really like you guys for me to be doing this.  Oh, okay, that's obvious.  Okay, ready?  Yes, we're ready.  Is that good enough?  Hmm, um, it was kind of hard to hear.  Are you using the right part of the phone?  Yes.  The mouthpiece, yes.  The mouthpiece, yes.  Rub a little harder, um, a little faster.  Yeah.  And a little longer.  Side by side, you've got to work it on all angles. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Okay, all right.  All right, all right, I'm getting an indication.  We're getting there.  You've got to pull your little panties out?  Yes, of course.  Don't want Daddy to catch you.  Can I come back in now?  Um, yeah, okay.  Okay.  All right.  I think we've got a pretty good indication.  Yeah, it's, uh, it's very, uh, Brillo Patty, but short, cropped. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, I'm going to go with, um.  I'm going to go, go ahead, Ant.  I'm going to go with, uh, um, triangle, but trimmed.  Wow, you're getting, uh, nose from the wow guys from last night, from Channel 7.  Hey, get them in here.  Let me see what they're thinking.  So you say what it?  Now, don't say what it is until we ask you.  All right, you're.  Uh, I'm, I'm, I'm going with, um, with, uh, uh, uh, just a groomed, uh, very well trimmed, 
[02:52:00]  but still, uh, in a triangular shape.  Okay?  Guys?  I'm going to say a very closely shaved Hitler mustache.  Okay.  All right.  I'm saying completely shaved.  Wow, he's going to be completely shaved.  Opie?  I don't know.  She's too, isn't much there in the sound there.  She's, she's innocent looking, though.  Opie.  Hey, man.  I'm going to go.  Yeah, I think I got to agree with Ant.  Really?  I don't, I'd like to try to, like, come up with a different one, but, uh, it, it seems  like a well-groomed triangle.  All right.  Are we ready? 
[02:52:30]  Yes, we are.  Uh, if you would please.  Bridget, what's in your pants?  You guys are right.  Yes.  Yes.  See, and I'll tell you why I said that.  I'll even give you my, my, my reasoning.  But it's, it's trimmed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It seemed like there was a lot of, a lot more area than just a mohawk.  Like, she was moving the phone and you were hearing, mohawk, mohawk, mohawk, side to  side, just, very short trip.  You see what I mean?  And then well-groomed, because we weren't getting that real thick thatch, like, like the machete 
[02:53:00]  through the jungle kind of, uh, sound.  So I opted for the, um, well-groomed triangle.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  Come on, let's see it.  Ah, come on, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Can we see your panties?  Did you see?  No.  She don't like showing.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  I'm just saying that.  It's obvious.  All right.  Well, these guys want to talk to Bridget.  I think they want to try to make you cry.  Okay.  Do we have, like, a, a prize for someone that makes her cry today?  Maybe a gift certificate to Paisano? 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, you're next on WNEW.  What's going on?  Hey, what's going on, Opie?  Hey, Anthony.  How are you?  All right.  How are you, you little dirty horse?  You can get this chick to do anything, huh?  That's a fine introduction.  Yeah.  What were you, conceived in a Petri dish?  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Does she know what a Petri dish is?  I know very well what a Petri dish is. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Were you conceived there?  Huh?  Were you conceived?  No, I wasn't.  Okay.  Oh, oh, okay.  Steve, very good job.  Wait, wait, wait.  You got one more in you?  Yes, I do.  All right, this is going to be your final statement.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Does she know what she has in common with a condom?  What?  When you're done, you just pull it off and throw it on the floor.  Steve, very good.  She's actually laughing, though. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, come on.  Cry.  Cry, bitch.  All right.  There you go, Steve.  We're playing now.  We're playing Make Bridget Cry.  The guy with the wow sign, that light sign, is in the other studio.  Dave, you're next.  Looks like the big light's behind Kiss.  Hey, Owen, hey.  How are you, man?  What's up?  Hey, Bridget, you dirty little whore.  I got something for you.  Hey, Bridget, maybe you, uh, it's not what you did, but how you were doing it.  You don't sound like the sharpest tool in the shed, you know? 
[02:55:00]  Did you open your eyes when you were doing it or what?  You sure you were where you were?  You sure you weren't sucking on his toe?  You dumb whore.  You running around with your underwear around, huh?  You're 20 years old, you look like a whore, too.  You dirty pig.  Come down there and smack you with my unit.  It's so much easier to do this when she's on the phone.  Oh, it's great.  She's way too innocent for this, man.  Hey, Bridget, you got anything to say or is your mouth full? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, I'm sure you're laughing.  You wouldn't be laughing.  You'd be going, you dirty pig.  All right, Dave, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  You're the best.  Very good, Mark.  I don't know, she's not crying.  Psycho, Mark, check her eyes.  No.  Nothing yet?  No, she's not crying.  All right, she's holding tough here.  Rob, you're next.  Yeah, I don't want to make Bridget cry.  I want to make her happy.  Okay.  I want to take Bridget out and teach her how about it, Bridget.  She seems a little disgusted. 
[02:56:00]  No, I'm not disgusted.  Bridget, has anyone gone south on you yet?  No.  No.  Wait a minute.  You'll cry from ecstasy.  All right, wait a minute.  Hold the phone.  This is a revelation.  No one's ever done that to you.  Would you like someone to do that?  Eventually.  Eventually?  Eventually.  Like by 7 o'clock?  Eventually?  What are we looking at here as a time frame?  I believe we have a few takers. 
[02:56:30]  Are you still a virgin, Bridget?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, okay.  Now that explains a little better.  Oh, so you'll give your boyfriend a little gift of a hummer, a little virgin girl, and  he dissed you like that?  Yep.  Oh, that's pretty bad.  All right.  That's pretty bad.  Are you interested in Rob's offer, Bridget?  Thank you, Rob.  I can't.  She can't?  Okay.  She's like one of those fresh clams at the barbecue. 
[02:57:00]  Let's go to Anthony.  Anthony, you're next.  Hello?  What's up, Anthony?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  I want to take her out, too, man.  I live in Jersey.  I know she lives in Jersey.  Yeah?  Everyone wants to take her out.  I'm 21 years old.  I work.  You know, come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Give it up.  It's like, come on.  Throw me a bone.  I'm working right now, guys.  I don't think she's looking for a date at this moment.  Come on.  I think I'll show a good time, you know.  All right.  I'm going to go to Richie.  Richie, you're next on N.E.W. 
[02:57:30]  What's up?  You low self-esteem cheese crotch bitch.  You are such a disgusting pig.  You know that?  You're a 20-year-old lowlife with no self-esteem.  What's the matter?  You have no parents?  Piggy and piglet?  Is that your parents?  Is that your little bitch?  Huh?  I can't hear you.  You're tongue-tied or you've got your friggin' crotch in your mouth.  What's going on?  This is brutal.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Mark?  I'm crying.  I'm crying.  All right, Richie, turn on.  I was listening.  I got it. 
[02:58:00]  Go ahead.  Sorry about that.  All right.  So what's going on there, little girl?  You have nothing better to do?  What's the matter?  She can't talk?  Is she that stupid?  Are you a mute?  What's the matter with her?  I don't really know what the question is.  What do you mean you know what the question is?  You're a bitch.  That's a statement, not a question.  Where the hell did you go to school?  You stupid bitch.  I can't even believe you.  You're such a smelly bitch.  Oh, this is awful.  Unbelievable.  This is just awful.  Owen A, you guys rule later.  All right, Richie. 
[02:58:30]  Good job.  Good job.  Good job.  Mark, what's going on?  Owen A.  Well, hell, we're playing the game.  Might as well give the guy credit.  What's up, Mark?  What's up?  Hey.  Listen, before I start, I just want to ask Anthony, I got a couple extra tickets to Riverdance  if he wants to go.  Hobo.  Thank you.  Where's Little Red Riding Whore?  I'm right here.  I don't want to take you out.  You know why your boyfriend smacked you in the head?  Because you probably smell.  You're a little whore tease.  Pig. 
[02:59:00]  I knew you were in that song.  Ronald McDonald had a whore.  Yeah, wasn't that?  You pig.  There's some angry people out there.  Jesus.  I'm frightened.  What do you think her boyfriend smacked her in the head for?  Because he didn't give her any.  Hummers.  Who wants hummers all the time?  Hummers.  All right.  That's why he smacked you.  All right, Mark.  Thanks, guys.  We're only going to give three more guys a chance, then we're going to wrap up the game.  Mike?  Hey, what's up?  Make Bridget cry.  I don't want to make Bridget cry.  I want to make her happy.  Okay.  Make her happy. 
[02:59:30]  She's gorgeous.  Okay.  Good.  No?  Yeah.  Come on.  I can do it.  All right.  That's very bad.  Two to go, Bridget.  Mark, what's going on?  Yeah, I wanted to ask Bridget out, too.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  You want to go out?  I live in Jersey.  This game is changing drastically.  Yeah, you know.  Hey.  That's bordering on a dial-a-date.  Ripping me off.  You invented that.  That's right.  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  All right.  All right.  I guess we have one more contestant. 
[03:00:00]  Let's go to Scott.  Hey, O'Neal.  What's up, buddy?  I think they're going about it the wrong way.  Bridget, you're 20 years old today, right?  Yes.  So you were with this guy last year, huh?  Uh-huh.  That must be kind of tough on your birthday and, like, when you're alone late at night.  What goes through your head?  I mean, don't you miss the guy?  I know you say you don't, but there's got to be times where it's tough, especially on  days like today.  I miss him.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You might just be kidding yourself. 
[03:00:30]  Have you seen the guy around at all?  Or are you trying to, like, you know, stay out of his neighborhood?  I've stayed away from him.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's got to be tough, though.  So he was around last birthday, huh?  Yeah.  What did he get you?  Was it something nice?  Or was it just some really crappy thing?  Bike pedals?  What?  Bike pedals.  Bike pedals.  You got me bike pedals.  All right.  I lost it.  All right, guys.  You guys roll.  All right.  Why did he get you bike pedals? 
[03:01:00]  Because that's what I wanted.  Like, just pedals for your bike?  For, so that you can clip on with your shoes and mountain bike.  Woo.  Yeah, you did lose a catch.  Jeez, let me tell you.  Hey, Ron, what's up?  Hey, Ron.  Ron.  Jeez, if you were together this year, maybe we'd gotten you the hand grips with the little  screamers flying off in the ends.  Hey, Billy, what's up?  You're in a dream.  Hey, listen, Bridget.  Okay.  What would Grandma think?  You know, dead Grandma. 
[03:01:30]  With you, with a mouthful of Grandma, baked the cakes for you and everything.  And now, you're with a mouthful of their caribou.  What about your mother?  Your poor mother.  She used to carry you around in a baby carriage, and you had a mouthful of his goo in your mouth.  Oh, my God.  It's horrible.  Don't you think about your family members when you're doing that?  Oh, Bridget.  Remember Grandma used to bake the cakes? 
[03:02:00]  Whoa, she's got a tear in her eye.  I got her, Owen.  I just want to stop.  Come on.  Oh, no.  Wait a minute.  I just need to tear her off.  We have a winner.  There you go, Billy.  Billy, you're a winner.  Wow, Billy taking the tact of the family members.  Wait, wait, Bridget.  Go under the light.  I swear to God.  Go under the light.  Just move your whole body under the light.  Pull your hair away a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got her.  You got her.  Oh, my God. 
[03:02:30]  You do it.  Wow, Billy.  Very strategic move Billy made.  There you go.  Going away from the degrading her to the family sensitivity angle.  Very smart man.  Beautiful, right, Owen?  And he pulls out a victory.  Look, he's all proud.  Now, what do you want, Billy?  What do you got for me, man?  You could get a gift certificate to Paisano of Mulberry Street, the official restaurant  of the O&A show, pretty much.  We got some CDs we could throw together for you.  I don't do wrestling.  My kid brother loves that crap.  Do we have wrestling? 
[03:03:00]  All right.  We have wrestling tickets.  Excellent.  Thanks, dude.  Hold on the line.  It's for the WWF event, I believe, April 15th at the Garden.  For the good one.  And tickets go on sale Sunday at Ticketmaster.  All right.  And we'll throw in a T-shirt, all right?  Excellent.  Thanks, dude.  Congratulations, you heartless scumbag.  Bye, Billy.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Billy's on line 10.  He wins the prizes.  I saw the tear.  Oh, wow.  That was mean.  That was not good.  You wanted to play, Bridget. 
[03:03:30]  I know.  I'm fine.  What got you?  That was just gross.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not really...  You don't want to think of your grandmother.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't want to think of your grandma.  I understand.  That old dried uterus.  Silly shit.  Silly shit.  Oh, we're on template.  Here we go. 
[03:04:00]  Goddamn template.  Hey, who's this?  Yo, yo, yo.  Who's this?  Yeah, this is the last...  The only black guy that listens to this show.  All right.  The only three guys.  No, we have a bunch of black guys listening to this show.  Yeah, one of the only three of us that went to the Super Bowl party.  He was the only three guys there.  What's that?  Exactly.  I want to know if she's going to bring that snatch phone to the next road show.  What's that?  You've got to bring the snatch phone to the next road show.  Snatch phone on tour.  Who's going to use that phone?  She rubbed the snatch all over her.  Yeah, she's a virgin, and she pulled down her tiny little panties, and that was pretty nice. 
[03:04:30]  All the guys trying to make her cry about giving homage.  Man, my girl listens to this stage.  Is she trying to kill me?  What's going on?  Yeah, right.  That's for real.  What are you talking bad about?  It's making her think about her grandmother.  What's going on?  Hey, I've got to ask you.  What does the black community think of all the white guys that are all imitating the...  We're not laughing with you.  We're laughing at you.  I know you guys are.  We're laughing at you.  That's right.  I'm way too hard.  You guys come up with the greatest phrases, and then Whitey wrecks them. 
[03:05:00]  Destroys them.  Whitey.  Destroys them.  You guys got, like, everyone on Wall Street walking around going, what's that?  All right, you guys rule.  All right, man.  Peace.  Opie, are you saying there's no black people on Wall Street?  Well, yeah, there's a few.  I had a thing.  I was trying to think of what you were saying.  Well, there's a lot of white guys on Wall Street.  You know what I'm saying.  No.  Oh, shut up.  Please explain yourself.  No, thank you.  All right, can we play a quick round of racial profiling going on here on the Opie and Anthony show? 
[03:05:30]  Oh, big surprise.  Didn't you check the calendar?  It was my turn today, yes?  Yes.  All right.  Do you want to play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Well, look at the time.  212-757-1027.  I want to thank the guys that were on TV yesterday with the wow signs on Channel 7.  Great job, guys.  Did Ben hook you guys up with some stuff or what?  Yeah, he definitely hooked us up.  See?  Very, very good.  You get your banner on TV.  You come down, a little tour of the studio and some prizes. 
[03:06:00]  You sat on the lesbian couch for an hour.  Ah.  You got to sit on the lesbian couch.  We didn't know until an hour later.  Something will be growing on your pants.  On the way home.  Believe me, it's like a culture.  Like yogurt cultures.  Yeah, that's scary.  And, of course, we got to thank Bridget for stopping by.  The famous Bridget from Make Bridget Cry.  We got to get you at one of our road shows.  You have to be 21?  Ah, we could probably.  We'll get you in as a stage prop or something.  Yeah.  You know?  Put you in a packing case. 
[03:06:30]  Or we'll just tour you around with the phone.  Well, forget it.  Look at me.  A dollar a sniff.  Oh, come on.  Rick's not here.  Opie's got to take the over-the-line roll today.  I feel left out, guys.  All right, let's go to Ed.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What's up?  Hey, you know what I learned today?  Huh?  I learned that maybe you should smell the phone.  Maybe that's why nobody...  Mark, go take a...  No, Spaz.  Where's Spaz? 
[03:07:00]  Anthony.  Yeah?  What comes next?  Get the phone in here.  Like...  Uh-oh.  Are you going to eat your fat?  What?  Are you going to eat your fat?  Oh, you're right, right.  From Caddyshack.  God damn.  You're going to eat your fat.  What comes next, man?  I'm thinking.  Oh, I'm sick, man.  I can't think today.  I'm heavily medicated.  Sorry, man.  What is it?  Spalding.  Oh, I was going to say that.  That's it.  Spalding. 
[03:07:30]  Spalding.  All right.  Nothing clean.  Thank you, Ed.  We got the phone in the studio.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  All right.  Was this the phone, Bridget?  Oh.  Is that the phone?  No, I want to leave.  Is it?  What?  Yeah.  Why do you want to leave?  What?  Oh, my God.  You're embarrassing her.  Why?  Go ahead.  Give it one.  Any hairs? 
[03:08:00]  No hairs?  No?  Smells pretty good.  Because this is like Psycho Mark's phone.  With the pot breath he has, this thing usually smells pretty bad.  There you go.  Ah, yeah, flowery.  Very nice.  There's like a flowery smell to it.  Sure.  Guys, would you like a sniff?  I don't have a sense of smell, but these two things.  No.  Wait, you don't.  What's with the people with no sense of smell popping up every so often?  Psycho Mark? 
[03:08:30]  Smell the phone.  Smell the phone.  All right.  Pass it along.  Bottle that scent.  Oh, my God.  Give it to the guy with the big, huge, light-up wow sign.  There you go.  Don't foul it with your hands.  Oh, thumbs up.  People passing it around like a fine wine.  Yes.  Delicate bouquet.  Nice legs.  Yes.  He's taking a big whiff over there, man.  All right.  Give Spaz.  It's like passing around like a pot pipe. 
[03:09:00]  Spaz?  I was about to pass that.  Wait, wait.  Spaz, what do you think?  It's good.  Well, say it in the mic.  He's speechless.  Say it in the mic.  Smells fresh.  Fridget's very embarrassed right now.  All right.  There you go.  Here, Stank.  Put the phone back.  All right.  Go on.  All right.  So I had a dump out.  Oh, my God. 
[03:09:30]  Go on.  I had to bust up the tension in here.  You can't say that.  I know.  You can't.  People on the phone are going crazy.  Sorry.  Unbelievable.  All right.  Lisa, what's going on?  Yeah, I learned that next time I call Opie and Anthony and start moaning and groaning and  announcing I'm high, make sure my mom doesn't come home from work.  She was listening?  Yeah, and I went to get a drink of water, and she was right there.  So I'm like in my room, and I'm not moving from here for a while now. 
[03:10:00]  Are you still real high?  Oh, yeah, definitely.  All right.  You sound like you're crashing a little bit at this point.  Listen, guys.  Yeah.  Um, can I come up to your show one day?  Um, yeah.  Really?  Yeah, they let anyone in.  You might as well.  Yeah, all you got to do is show up.  They'll send you right down.  Look at these clowns.  They got us.  All right, Lisa.  Okay.  Bye.  I learned Bridget is a virgin, and she uses nice perfumes on her. 
[03:10:30]  So do you just, you know, soap and water, basically?  Basically.  That's good.  Did you take your perfume in and just do a quick, like, or no?  No, huh?  Okay.  We'll take one more call.  We've got to step aside for Donna Mike.  Tom, you're next on NAW.  The last call of the day.  How are you doing, ONA?  Good.  I learned that red-headed virgins smell flowery.  You guys rule.  Jenna show grads rule. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, cool.  Thanks, Tom.  And there we go.  Another radio show behind us.  Whoa, yeah.  Look at that.  Got to thank Bridget.  Let's hear it for Bridget for being a good sport today.  Thank God.  From Nick Bridget, Craig.  We came on strong in the end.  I think the coffee helped us out.  Yeah, it definitely helped us out.  Right about 5 o'clock or so, we dosed up.  What about the coffee?  Had some cup of crack.  Yeah, and then Psycho Mark brought in like an 8-ball.  We all just snorted as much cocaine as we could before our hearts exploded. 
[03:11:30]  And it really picked the show up, I think.  It really helped us out today, I can say.  Sure.  And then, thank you, the guys that came down with the Wow Sons and the Crystal Meth.  That was great.  Yes.  Yeah.  Now I just got to get this ecstasy out of my system.  I'm going to do a lewd and maybe just speedball directly into the retina, and I'll be fine.  And with that, we'll see you guys tomorrow, too, all right?  Stay tuned for Don and Mike.  Opie.  Boring.  Anthony.  Boring.  Producer Rick.  Boring.  Spaz.  Yay.  Yay.  The Opie and Anthony Show.
