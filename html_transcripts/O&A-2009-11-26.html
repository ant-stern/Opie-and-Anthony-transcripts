<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed a series of interconnected segments revolving around the hosts' and callers' dysfunctional families and childhoods.  The show opened with a "Sharing the Laughter and Love, an Opie and Anthony family special," featuring Greg Hughes and Kumia portraying Opie and Anthony respectively, with Little James Norton playing himself and Jerry Springer providing comedic narration.  This segment focused on childhood trauma and parental dysfunction, with Jim Norton recounting his father's depression, physical abuse (including an incident involving stolen quarters and ice cream sandwiches), his mother's verbal abuse (including calling him "fuck"), and his uncle's marijuana operation.  Anthony shared stories of his father's depression and questionable finances, along with the discovery of compromising photos. Callers contributed their own tales of parental abandonment, bigamy, physical abuse, emotional neglect, and a parent’s death due to alcoholism. One caller even described a blind date revelation about his date's father being imprisoned for child molestation. Humorous moments included Jerry Springer's narration, Norton's imaginary KISS friends, and a running joke about Norton's supposed attraction to urine. A caller also described his father taking him to strip clubs, and the fictional game "Monster Rain" was played.

The show then shifted to a segment about intern Sam's surprisingly aristocratic family tree, prompting disbelief and vulgar jokes from the hosts about Sam's ethnicity and other topics. This transitioned into a discussion about "mommy issues," with staff members Danny and Travis sharing anecdotes about strained relationships with their mothers.  Travis’s story involved his mother marrying a Jewish man, leading to highly offensive and antisemitic remarks. A voicemail from Danny's mother expressing anger was played. Opie's brother, Brett, called in to describe accidentally seeing his father's genitals in a hospital. Anthony’s sister Dawn and her baby, along with his brother Joe via phone, were in studio, contributing to the family dynamic discussions.

Next, the focus turned to Anthony's frustration with his brother Joe and sister-in-law Dawn's preoccupation with their newborn twins, Layla and Warren.  The segment featured graphic details about the babies' bodily functions and humorous nicknames. Joe's transformation into a devoted father was contrasted with his past hard-partying lifestyle (including cocaine use). Anthony's stepfather, Sal, was a guest in the studio, sharing anecdotes, including a suggestive encounter with a young woman and his reaction to a graphic internet video ("Two Girls, One Cup").  Discussions included the stock market's decline, explicit jokes about breasts and breastfeeding, and Opie's childhood poverty.

A subsequent segment centered on chaotic childhoods and dysfunctional family vacations. Elmo recounted using a cement bag for school lunches, leading to discussions of humiliating lunch experiences.  Disastrous vacations were recounted, including a trip to a rundown Catskills property with bug infestations, near-drowning, and the discovery of a previous owner's death in a house fire. Callers shared stories of self-inflicted injuries for attention and other attention-seeking behaviors; one caller described being urinated on, another being burned on a stove.  The hosts reminisced about bullying and difficulties fitting in. Chris, a caller, shared an embarrassing experience representing Germany on International Day at school. More stories of childhood trauma and attention-seeking mishaps were shared by callers, concluding with a preview of another disastrous family vacation. Jerry Springer's voice provided comedic effect.

The final segment, "Sharing the Laughter and Love: An Opie and Anthony Family Special," continued the theme of dysfunctional families.  Opie shared stories of his large, chaotic family, including numerous children, transient individuals, a sister's disappearance, unsanitary family baths (with fights over hot water and urination incidents), and a family vacation where his twin brother fell into a river. Rob, a guest, corroborated these stories of a large family with transient members. Jim Norton speculated about his parents being swingers.  Brett called in to recount embarrassing experiences involving his father catching him naked and watching pornography, and his mother catching him masturbating in the bathtub with his siblings and pets.  A prank caller, Mark, pretended to be in jail for soliciting prostitutes (including a transvestite with an STD) to his mother. Anthony briefly discussed a childhood crush on a cousin, leading to a detailed discussion of her physical attributes, including her underwear. The segment was characterized by crude humor, sexual innuendo, and explicit descriptions of family dysfunction.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All right, it's time for sharing the laughter and love of an Opie and Anthony family special starring Greg Hughes as Opie, Anthony, Kumia as Anthony, Little James Norton as himself.  Ira, Ira, you're just reading it. You gotta put some energy in it.  Oh, also appearing Greg Hughes as Opie, Anthony, Kumia as Anthony, Little James Norton as himself and featuring the staff and families of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  Hey, I'm Jerry Springer and I'm interrupting my very busy schedule, taping the 19th season of the Jerry Springer Show  to bring you Sharing the Laughter and Love, an Opie and Anthony family special.  Sounds like that Alan Sick TV theme song. 
[00:01:00]  Now, over the next few hours, join myself along with Sam and Eric as we take a journey through some of the most memorable  and heartwarming family moments associated with the Opie and Anthony show.  So gather the kids around the fireplace as we begin Sharing the Laughter and Love, an Opie and Anthony family special.  We start our special with Opie, Anthony, and Jim telling stories of what it was like for them growing up with their crazy parents. 
[00:01:30]  Did Anthony's father suffer from depression?  And why did Jimmy's mother call him the F-word?  Let's find out.  I love the smell of a new book.  Everyone, every boy does.  Okay.  Every boy.  I love the smell.  I just need us to know.  It's like smelling dittos when they used to come off of the mimeograph machine.  It's like the mimeograph.  Ann.  Yeah?  Chill.  Sorry.  Forgot.  Half the audience has no fucking idea what you just said.  Well, with the old printing press.  I remember when the old printing press was. 
[00:02:00]  We got to make believe we didn't live in that time.  Ching, ching, ching, ching, ching, ching.  And then you go.  But it was like cocaine.  A cold fucking cane.  Because it would only last for such a short period of time.  And then you try to get another hit off of it.  But once those hit the air.  Like when they were stacked up.  Right.  Wait, you actually got a little buzz off that?  I just like the smell.  No, no, not a buzz.  The smell itself.  Oh, okay.  The smell itself was pleasurable.  So, you know, if you want to call that a buzz.  I mean, it was kind of nice. 
[00:02:30]  You'd get that.  Ah, that's good.  But then it would just go away.  Right.  And you'd sit there sniffing.  And you're like, eh, it's gone.  Right.  Smells gone.  I need new dittos.  Jason in Ohio.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Jason.  Did you guys, you know what I thought they always smelled like was ice cream sandwiches.  Isn't that weird?  Wow, hold on.  Let me try to.  I'm thinking of that.  No, I'm not getting ice cream.  Although, I must say, one of the best smelling snacks ever was an ice cream sandwich. 
[00:03:00]  The chocolatey, cookie-like, cakey outside and the vanilla ice cream inside.  Not chocolate.  Must be vanilla.  Oh, yeah.  Always vanilla.  Go to the grocery.  Get yourself a box of ice cream sandwiches.  Open them up and smell it.  Smell the paper before you open it up.  And tell me it doesn't smell like a ditto from a mimeograph.  How about we just agree?  I have an aversion to ice cream sandwiches now because ice cream sandwiches were involved in the only time my father ever physically struck me. 
[00:03:30]  So you can't eat ice cream sandwiches?  She was very, like, you know, verbally abusive, if you want to put it that way.  Yeah.  But one time he hit me.  That's when you stole the quarters.  Actually smacked me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, I pay attention.  Yes.  I stole the quarters.  To get an ice cream sandwich because you were starving because he wasn't feeding you properly.  Yes, thank you.  Because he was too busy doing other things.  I know this story.  He insisted that I bought model rockets with it. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  Because I was into model rocketry.  Right.  And I didn't.  I bought one whole box of ice cream sandwiches and ate the entire box.  It was delicious.  Of course it is.  What a great fucking time that was.  You can't just have one of those.  I ate the entire box because I went to Thrifty Drug and Discount Store out there in California.  And I went in with the quarters.  And then I just, Anthony deserved to be hit.  Thank you.  People are saying. 
[00:04:30]  So I ate the whole box of ice cream sandwiches.  And then once they found out the quarters were missing, dad took me outside and on our  way to the stable said, did you steal Corey's quarters?  Who's Corey?  Corey was his girlfriend.  Corey Lytle.  Wife.  Yeah, Corey Lytle.  And we were flying through the ranch.  I think Corey was depressed because he was missing money and went for a little plane ride.  Yeah.  Corey was my father's girlfriend and then later the wife.  Ah.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Was she hot?  Uh, she was hot in her younger years.  I'll give her that.  Uh, she had naked pictures in, in the, um, uh, one of the night tables and my father's  night table.  And I found them little naked Polaroids of when she was like in her twenties and stuff.  And, uh, yeah, yeah.  Pretty hot.  Um, are the kids listening right now?  What?  What?  Uh, you know how we like to do that bit, but are the kids at school right now?  I don't want to talk about the bit.  Yeah.  Probably.  So maybe tomorrow?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll do it tomorrow.  Yeah, that bit's good.  Anyway, sorry.  Go ahead.  That bit is good. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  So, uh, uh, we went for a little drive and then he said, did you just take the quarters?  And I was like, well, yeah.  He goes, what'd you buy with it?  I said, ice cream sandwiches.  I was starving.  I was really hungry.  And he goes, no, you bought, you bought the fucking rockets with it, didn't you?  I'm like, no, I bought ice cream sandwiches.  I was starving.  I have it whack right across the face.  Why?  And then, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, and he goes, shut up, stop crying or I'll give you something  to cry about.  That was always his thing when I would cry. 
[00:06:00]  Stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about.  It's like, well, you just did.  You just gave me something to cry about.  You smacked me very hard in the face.  That's what you should have said.  You just did, cocksucker.  Oh, that would have been a good one.  Then it wouldn't have been open hand.  Would have been a nice closed fit.  Would he have punched you in the face for that?  Why?  Uh, yeah, he probably would have punched me.  But why would he be bothered that you want to buy model rockets?  That doesn't make sense.  That means he's got a smart kid.  Here it is.  No, he's mad that, he's mad that the quarters were gone.  He was mad at himself.  He was mad at himself for not feeding his kid. 
[00:06:30]  You think so?  See, yeah, yeah.  He was very, like, like embarrassed, I think, with the fact that I bought a box of ice cream  sandwiches because I was starving and he wasn't supporting his child.  So, instead, if I had used the quarters to buy model rockets, then it was my fault.  See, that's why, you know, hence the smack in the face.  And I think, I think, honestly, he wanted to slap himself.  Ooh, someone's going to therapy.  No, I'm not.  Someone just used the shining. 
[00:07:00]  I swear to God.  It is one of those things.  It's one of those things where it's like, if you can't figure that shit out.  Right, right.  Maybe he did it to himself.  Yeah, maybe he did it to himself.  You don't think your dad was a happy person?  No, no.  I think my father was very depressed.  About what?  Just, you know, depression.  Whenever it makes someone depressed.  You know, he could never fucking, hey, he could never hit that high note, Alice.  It was just one of those things.  New York, failed marriage, couldn't really fucking hold a job or anything. 
[00:07:30]  He goes out to California to become a cowboy.  And he does pretty good.  Opens up a welding business kind of a thing.  And then the fucking economy turns around.  And that went down the shitter.  So he was just kind of like, eh.  Was he a smart guy?  Yeah, he was a pretty smart guy.  He was very smart with scamming.  Because I think he'd rather scam and try to figure out a way to turn a few bucks.  You want to take the shortcut?  Yeah, the shortcut.  Instead of, you know, really applying.  Digging in.  And working and doing things. 
[00:08:00]  What's he look like?  Did you have a picture of him online?  Are you on Facebook or something?  Probably got one somewhere.  I've heard that you look exactly like your father.  Really?  Not exactly.  Well, pretty close.  He was like horseshoe balled at like 25.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Someone in your family told me that you look very much like your father.  Yeah, there is a similar.  There is a big similarity.  I know I got pictures at home.  But, you know, online.  On my computer.  But, yeah.  Yeah, so now whenever I eat ice cream sandwiches. 
[00:08:30]  And then I had another ice cream sandwich problem with Uncle Joe.  What did Uncle Joe do?  Well, Uncle Joe was living at our house when he was growing marijuana in the backyard.  And your mom thought it was oregano.  And he was with hippie Aunt Pat.  Sure.  Yeah.  And they lived downstairs when we were living upstairs in a rented house.  I guess to supplement the rent and stuff like that.  And he shared our refrigerator.  He didn't have one downstairs.  So he got big ice cream sandwiches and put them in a big box and put it in the freezer. 
[00:09:00]  And all of us, me, my brother, and sister, just opened up the freezer and were like, whoa.  So we just started mowing down on Uncle Joe's ice cream sandwiches.  That's what kids do, of course.  I know.  He can't have a box of ice cream sandwiches and assume the kids aren't going to get out of it.  But his reaction was so good because he went into the kitchen.  And we're all sitting on the couch watching TV.  And he goes into the kitchen, opens up the freezer.  And we were notorious for leaving empty boxes in the freezer and fridge.  Like, notorious for doing that. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, you can't throw the box out because then he's on to you.  Yeah.  You're just hoping that he forgets about it.  Exactly.  So he took the empty box out.  And I hear, oh, from in the kitchen.  And then he comes out with the empty box, looks at us, and just goes, you bummers, and threw the box at us.  He said, you bummers, and threw the box at us.  Who said that?  My Uncle Joe.  Uncle Joe.  He was probably stoned out of his gourd.  And, like, the thought of those ice cream sandwiches was the best thing in the world. 
[00:10:00]  When he opened the freezer and saw the box, he's just like, ah.  And then he opens, lifts up the box, and it's empty.  We were indeed bummers.  We bummed him out.  But just to hear him go, you bummers.  And then threw the empty, like, fucking one ounce box at us.  What's worse than an empty ice cream sandwich box?  Oh, when you're stoned like that, you just want to have ice cream sandwich.  And it's empty. 
[00:10:30]  And he just bought it.  Oh, it was great.  That's fucking funny.  Uncle Joe.  So you're scared of ice cream sandwiches?  No, there's just not.  Would it bring back some of these memories if you had one?  When I eat ice cream sandwiches, I enjoy them thoroughly.  But I don't eat them much these days.  But I always think of those two instances.  More so the slap in the face one than the you bummers.  You bummers was kind of funny.  Yeah, you got to be chuckling inside a little bit.  To this day, we still goof on Uncle Joe about that at Family Functions.  You bummers. 
[00:11:00]  I don't remember my mom not being on psych meds.  Really?  Don't remember anymore.  Not at all?  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  Eek.  Eek.  Eek.  Nice to have a good cry.  We had broken parents.  That's why I'm so fucked up now.  Because of my upbringing. 
[00:11:30]  That's why I do all the bad things.  I just shut up.  Suck it up, you faggots.  Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  I think Anthony has that conversation in the mirror every morning when he's blitzing his teeth.  Suck it up, faggot.  I'm crying.  I'm like Gollum.  I'm talking to myself.  You want to have a good cry with us, Jimmy?  But Father was good.  He was good to us.  No, he wasn't.  He smacked you with ice cream sandwiches.  But he was good.  We had fun riding horses. 
[00:12:00]  Stop crying.  What you never ate.  Stop crying, you bummers.  You bummers.  Jimmy, think of something sad and get a good cry out and we'll join you.  Will you tell us what you're thinking about?  Yeah.  Give us a good upbringing.  Something that should have fucked you up as a kid.  A lot of people get fucked up by something.  But you skated right through.  There you go.  Oh, all right.  My first thought was the pay difference between all of us.  I had some tears. 
[00:12:30]  Now, think of something that I should have skated.  Yeah, is there something like that your parents did where it was like, wow, you know, that's  kind of fucked up for a parent to do?  You asshole.  I really can't think of anything my parents did.  No?  There's not one instance where you as a child thought like, well, it's kind of fucked up  for a parent to do.  No?  No, I remember being surprised.  This doesn't make me sad, though. 
[00:13:00]  I remember being surprised.  I was moving my Zim-Zam in the back.  What the fuck is a Zim-Zam?  Oh, not Zim-Zam.  It was a batter up.  It was like a big cement block.  And you had a big metal pole through it.  And a fake baseball on the end of it, you'd swing it.  And you could practice your batting swing.  Yeah, that's how retards practice batting.  Okay, well, I owned one.  You owned a retard?  Yes, I did.  I would use his tongue.  We would do 45, 50 stamps at a time.  So I was, my mother was helping me move it. 
[00:13:30]  And we were putting it down.  And she told me to be careful because she had hurt her hand.  Oh.  And I dropped it and it crushed, it crushed her finger.  I did exactly what she just told me not to do.  And she went, she went, you fuck.  Oh, no way.  Mother called me a fuck.  How old were you?  At 12 or whatever.  Oh, that's terrible, though. 
[00:14:00]  Your mom calling you a fuck.  I was very, uh.  You, you, fuck.  You, fuck.  She said, you, fuck.  Holy shit, that is hysterical.  It was not one of my finer moments.  You fuck.  How old were you, did you say?  At 12, I want to say.  Oh, that's a bad age.  Oh, wow.  You got the hormones pumping through your body.  I was more embarrassed.  Like, I wasn't mad at her. 
[00:14:30]  It's, the best part is, she could have just yelled out, fuck.  Yeah.  And, like, because she was hurt.  But to say, you, fuck, was like, you're the fuck, because you caused this.  Well, we both knew who the problem was.  She goes, be very careful, I hurt my hand.  And I just dropped it.  And it, fuck, her fingers swolled all up.  I can't picture that lovely woman that left you those voicemails calling you out.  You, fuck.  Oh, it was her fucking.  Oh, is that great?  It was a hurting Johnny.  Oh.  You got it.  I got to read this one. 
[00:15:00]  Steve B. from Connecticut.  My mom, enraged and screaming at us from the top of the stairs, said, why did I have kids?  I could have had a Mercedes.  It was so absurd, I almost did a spit take.  Yeah, that might stick with you.  Like I said, you got to suck it up.  Well, listen, guys.  We got a lot of people that want to cry today.  Tom in Philly.  Yeah, it was Christmas Eve one year and I was, I don't know, 12, 13 years old.  And dad got pissed off me. 
[00:15:30]  Came up around 10, 11 o'clock.  Pinched my tummy and called me fatty.  I brought it up a couple years ago and everybody looked at me like I had a dick run out of  my forehead.  It affected you so much that you remember it?  Yeah, but you know what?  He doesn't.  Of course not.  He never did such a thing.  Of course not.  It's just in passing when they do it.  But it's stuff that you stick.  Sticks with you.  How did it affect you, fatty?  I'm still fat, Jimmy. 
[00:16:00]  Huh?  I'm still fat.  By the way, E-Rock, what are you working on right now?  Brad in Jersey.  Brad.  Never necessary.  The guy's just working hard on the hall, minding his own fucking business.  No, he's not.  He's doing whatever he can to make this show better.  No, he's not.  We haven't even seen him yet today, but I don't know if he's here.  Here he is.  Here's what E-Rock's doing.  He's on his back in the office with a pack of Rolos, and he's naked, and he's rubbing  them the way a cat plays with an olive. 
[00:16:30]  Rolos.  A cat plays with an olive?  I've never seen that before, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  My cat, John, loved olives.  John?  That was my cat name.  Why did you name your cat, John?  I originally named him Susan, because I thought it was a girl.  Oh.  Oh.  Why not Ted?  I didn't think of it.  Meow, meow, Anthony.  Give me another olive.  People get mad because I kicked the duty out of the litter box.  Elliot's just scattered litter all over the rung.  Holy shit.  There's some great calls coming in. 
[00:17:00]  Let's go to Brad in Jersey.  Brad.  Guys, thanks for letting me join the pity party.  All right.  No problem.  One morning, I woke up.  I used to live with my old man, with my dad and my grandmother.  And one morning, I woke up.  My father was gone, and I didn't see him again for a good three years after that.  Wow.  Just left.  Just got up and left.  It turns out, he passed away a few years ago, and I found out he actually went to jail  for bigamy.  Ah.  Bigamy.  Had a couple of wives there, eh?  How the fuck did you juggle a couple of wives?  That is the most fucked up thing in this world. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  He never legally divorced his first wife when he married my mother.  And so, yeah, he went to jail for three years for it.  Wow.  I was in a relationship with a certain girl, woman, whatever you want to call it, yes, in  a relationship whose father left on Christmas Day, walked out on Christmas Day, and then  proceeded to just start a brand new family from scratch. 
[00:18:00]  New woman, new kids, and then didn't even acknowledge the other family existed.  Ooh, talk about toting around a steamer trunk of baggage with that one.  Did that make Christmas fun?  Whoa!  Every fucking Christmas.  Every Christmas and Father's Day.  No, not poor Melinda, you dummy.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Yeah.  Good evening.  Hey, Paul. 
[00:18:30]  What's up, guys?  Yeah, I remember a couple years ago, fairly recently, I had to go out and help my mom find  my dad a strip club.  So I was like a little 12-year-old kid going around strip clubs finding my dad.  Yeah.  That was my friend Roy.  We walked around, had to find his father Roy and my father, because my mother and Roy's  wife said, where are the guys?  And we said, we'll look for him.  And we didn't know, and they didn't know where we were going, but we just walked around up 
[00:19:00]  by the town, and we saw like this topless joint, and we were like laughing, like, let's  look.  Boobies.  And the windows were all painted over.  They always had just a little bit where you could see.  But there were always scratches.  There was always scratches, especially the bottom, just from anything, beer bottles.  So you'd look in, and you could kind of see, and we saw my father and Roy sitting at the  bar, just down in fucking beers, watching the tit dancers, when they were supposed to  be out shopping for a barbecue, and bringing the food back, and the wives are just sitting 
[00:19:30]  there like, they can't do anything, they can't cook anything, they're just sitting there  going, where are they?  And they're down in beers in the tit bar.  You think one of them just said, hey, let's stop off and have a quick one?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and it turned into like fucking two, at least two hours of sitting there watching  strippers.  And then, I think when one guy opened the door to leave, I yelled in like, Daddy!  And he came outside, what the fuck are you doing?  I'm trying to make time with this broad in here. 
[00:20:00]  And I said like, Mommy, he said, you know, you and Roy Roy have to come back, because you  have the food.  Did he hit you?  Yeah, he just punched me square on the face.  No.  He said, well, you go back there and tell him we're on our way.  And don't tell him where we were.  Yeah, not a word of this to your mother.  Tell him we were shopping.  We're still shopping.  You know, we got business.  It was always some business to tend to.  I think you're lying.  I got lying.  Because that sounds like a happy day, sir.  No, no, no, no.  That wasn't happy.  Was your father Tom Bosley? 
[00:20:30]  I didn't have a fake ID and go in there with my friends.  I think you're lying.  And then sit down and see Tom Bosley there with a client.  I think you're lying.  Where he later explained that he had to do things like that to satisfy the client.  And he wasn't in there being a pervert himself.  Richie was so depressed.  Oh, he's dead as father.  Get over it, faggot.  Good.  Be happy about it.  Exactly.  At least he's on a fucking booth with a hole in it.  He's at the hardware store fucking cranking huge bolts up his ass with a fucking wrench.  Yeah, this is fun.  This is a fun call right here.  Mike in Texas.  Mike.  Good evening. 
[00:21:00]  Hi.  Hi, Mike.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks.  And I got to tell you why.  Hell, I'm scarred and I will never go home on another blind date.  Holy shit.  Girl, we're barely through appetizers.  Just having some small talk telling me that how she grew up with her grandparents, right?  She seems pretty well adjusted.  Not even 6.30 at night.  Long night to go.  She explained that for the last 15 years, the reason she grew up with her grandparents, 
[00:21:30]  because her mom walked out overnight.  Okay, that's not too bad.  Yeah, well, her mom walked out overnight because her dad's been doing 15 to who knows how long  down in Brownsville, Texas, big boy pen for molesting several neighborhood girls, including her sister.  Wow.  Dude, I hope you ran from that date.  Hey, dude, I was home by 7.30 and out with the boys trying to drink away that experience.  In the words of one of my good friends, don't marry a face. 
[00:22:00]  Gotta be more than just a face.  Don't marry a face.  Some people get caught up in how beautiful the person is and ignores all the shit that's right in front of you.  It's right there for the taking.  And you ignore it because she's a face.  Don't marry a face.  Be good.  See you, man.  Oh, you can marry a beautiful girl, but you want to make sure there's more than just a face happening.  Ah.  Get it? 
[00:22:30]  Got to remember that.  Actually, I'll never marry anything ever again.  Seven days.  I think you're lying.  Seven days.  I will.  I shan't.  You're lying.  I shan't.  I shan't marry.  Let's say hi to Bill.  Hello, Bill.  In Georgia.  Hello, boys.  Hey.  Hey, when I was about 13, my dad told me I was a little short, fat kid.  My dad told me that I look like an Irish potato with two toothpicks stuck in it.  I've never forgotten that.  Oh, that's terrible. 
[00:23:00]  That's going to leave a scar, right?  Yeah.  I think.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  I'm loading up a full trailer load of beer.  You want me to run by the house with it?  I got plenty.  A little beer run?  Yeah.  I'm making a beer run here down in the making.  You need a little beer.  You got the big wedding this weekend, Ed.  Yeah.  There's even some O'Doul's on here.  Jimmy can take.  I don't drink O'Doul's.  All right.  You know.  You old bastard.  Taking Opie's advice, I might marry again. 
[00:23:30]  Never marry a face.  I'm going to dig up Jane Mansfield.  Oh, my God.  Which part?  Well, the lower half.  You don't marry the face.  What smells worse?  Is it her vag or Jennifer Aniston's?  Oh, my God.  That's going to be a rough one.  At least without a head, she's not going to be talking about Brad Pitt.  Right.  Man, that's a good point.  Right.  Linger two hours ago.  Let's go to Kevin in New Hampshire.  Kevin.  Hey.  Good evening. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Good evening.  Hi.  Well, reminiscent to Opie's story with the beating underneath the ass cheeks where you can't  walk for six months because of the welts on your legs.  Let me tell you how that all happened.  And why I became a vet tech in order to atone for my sins.  When I was very young, my brother and I had a tire swing in our front yard that the tire  rotted out of.  So it was just like a big, like a hole that you put your foot in and swing on.  And we thought it'd be cool and cute to have my mother's Cocker Spaniel, ironically named 
[00:24:30]  Lucky, swing in it.  Ironically named Lucky.  How cute is that?  So we're pushing the dog, trying to put his ass cheeks up on the swing.  And about that time, my dad pulled in the driveway and he goes, what the fuck are you doing?  And I turned around and let the dog go.  And that dog got caught in that noose and it broke its neck instantly.  Jesus.  Right in front of my mother and father.  I killed her dog. 
[00:25:00]  Wow.  Now they must punish you.  That's a you fuck.  I think it was the worst beating of epic proportions.  And to this day, my mother, you know, 35 years later, will still say, you killed my dog.  You did.  To bring it up in every argument.  You did.  Yeah, you kind of did.  Well, you know.  I was only eight years old.  I think we have time for maybe two more.  Then we got to take a break.  Right, right.  Thank you, sir.  Nate in Tennessee.  Nate.  Hey, guys. 
[00:25:30]  How's it going?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Yeah, this one's real fucked up.  Whenever I was about 16, I woke up in the middle of the night, went outside to look for my mother because I couldn't find her.  Found her out there in her nightgown.  Come to turn out, she told my father that she was raped that night.  She was trying to cover up for an affair she was having?  Yeah, yeah.  After an investigation, it turns out she was having an affair.  Holy shit.  Having an affair. 
[00:26:00]  That's it.  Thank you, sir.  Wow.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Something just got fucked up.  What the hell's going on there?  I want to hear a good drunk mom story.  Yeah, let's go to there.  To this one.  Kevin in Jersey.  What's up, Kevin?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm like eight years old.  My mom used to make me wear this super thick snowsuit.  You know, like all the kids did.  They'd bundle them up at that age.  So I'm on my way home from school.  I'm laying down on the snow. 
[00:26:30]  It's a great snowy day.  I'm doing the snow angel.  All's well in my world.  Suddenly, I look up and my mom's drunken face is looking down at me.  She lifts me up.  Just starts wailing on me.  Then looks at me and says, don't get any snow on your fucking snowsuit.  But it's a snowsuit, mommy.  But it's a snowsuit.  She went through a rough patch.  A rough patch.  Don't they understand what this does to a kid?  I had another girlfriend.  Oh, this one was severe baggage also. 
[00:27:00]  Give me a hint so I could, you know.  No, you don't really know this one.  It's going way back.  Yeah, you don't know it.  Before?  Yeah, yeah.  Before.  Before.  Before the ex, yeah, before the wife.  She was in high school, I believe.  Not at the time we were going out.  Right.  But when she was in high school, her mother was like a raging alky.  And she came downstairs and her mother is on the floor of the kitchen. 
[00:27:30]  But she had always passed out drunk and just lay there.  So she tries to wake her up.  She's like, mom.  And the mother's like, all groggy and shit.  So she goes, she just puts a blanket on her, a little pillow under her head and stuff like  that.  And then goes off to school.  She comes back home.  Nothing's moved.  She goes, hello, ma?  Nothing.  Dead. 
[00:28:00]  Dead as a doorknob.  Apparently, she not only was laying on the floor, but on the way from standing to the  floor, she hit her head on the corner of the counter and bashed in her head and then  hit the floor.  So she was semi-conscious.  Oh my God.  And the kid went to school knowing that if maybe she'd have noticed, she might have been  able to call the ambulance or something like that.  She was always haunted by that guilt of just leaving her mother die on the kitchen floor.  Wow.  What a treat that was around Mother's Day and holidays like that. 
[00:28:30]  Sure.  Oh, what a treat just any day.  Sometimes she would just burst out crying for no reason.  And that kitchen floor was spotless, though.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So I'll deal with that for a little while.  Would you ever tease her if she started cleaning the counter and go, hey, you missed a little  brain matter?  Hey, don't slip.  Bye.  Right?  Oh, yeah.  She wasn't.  She was a little off about that situation. 
[00:29:00]  We're looking for good stories.  Dad nearly beat me to death.  We're playing with matches.  I mean, come on.  Come on.  Stop it.  We burned fucking places down.  Exactly.  Mom threw a fork at me when I was eight.  Come on.  Please.  Come on.  Stop.  Let's go to Phil in Minnesota.  Phil.  Phil.  Hello, Phil.  Good morning.  Um, I was born a heroin addicted baby and I guess I was about a year and a half.  My mom OD'd and my father, the supposed father, uh, came home, found her dead and slit his own 
[00:29:30]  wrist.  And they found me in the, in the apartment days later, crying, not knowing what to do,  wandering around.  Were you eating your parents?  Were you hungry and just eating, gnawing away at your parents?  So, how has this affected you now that you're an adult?  Uh, well, I've gone through my stint of, uh, drug abuse and whatnot.  Uh, it's still kind of haunting me.  No, negatively.  How has this affected you? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Negatively?  And then it goes negatively?  Well, I guess it's just, you know, haunting that, you know, my parents, especially the supposed  father, didn't want anything to do with me.  Yeah, you're so unwanted.  Yeah.  Uh, but, that's all I got.  I'm punching out.  Thank you, Sam.  All right, buddy.  Sharing the life and love.  An Opie and Anthony family special.  I'm Jerry Springer.  Let's go to Sam and Eric to see what's coming up after the break.  Thanks, Jerry. 
[00:30:30]  E-Rock, when we get back, Jim Norton had a very strange childhood.  Yes, he did, Sam, involving imaginary childhood friends.  And some would beat him up and then give him a hug.  Of course, after kicking him down the stairs, what better than a lovable hug?  Plus, who doesn't like a good trip to a Village People concert with your father?  Not me.  But also, a bit that involves you, Sam.  A young Sam the Intern comes in with his family tree.  Is he really a black guy?  Who knows?  Stay tuned for Sharing the Laughter and Love, an Opie and Anthony family special. 
[00:31:00]  If you ever step on me again like that, I'll slit your fucking throat.  Get the fuck out.  Stay right there.  More of Sharing the Laughter and Love, an Opie and Anthony family special coming right up.  Show me that smile, Opie.  Show me that smile.  Hey, this is TV's greatest sitcom father, by my own survey, Alan Thicke, and you're listening  to Opie and Anthony rip off my show, Growing Pains, with their Sharing the Laughter and Love 
[00:31:30]  special.  Welcome back to Sharing the Laughter and Love, an Opie and Anthony family special.  We're back with Sharing the Laughter and Love, an Opie and Anthony family special.  I'm Jerry Springer.  In this segment, Jimmy shares the story of going to see the Village People with his father  and some of his imaginary friends, including members of KISS, who would beat him up and 
[00:32:00]  then give him a hug.  Creepy.  My dad took me to see the Village People when I was a little boy.  Oh.  What?  Really?  In concert.  I saw them in concert.  Why would your dad take you to see the Village People?  I don't know.  Why would I play Monster Rain?  How many questions are we going to ask?  I'm just saying that I went to see the Village People and Sister Sledge was the opening band.  So was he a fan of the Village People?  No, I was.  I had all their records.  And you were family.  Wow, that's a big surprise.  YMCA, I had In the Navy, I had Macho Man was great, and the Live One, Live and Sleazy. 
[00:32:30]  You were the strangest little kid.  Just a little weirdo.  And he's a normal man?  No.  How did you discover the Village People?  They were huge in the 70s.  No, no, no, no, dude.  There was knowing about the Village People and then discovering the Village People.  I don't know.  I'm listening to them.  But I remember the construction crew cover.  I discovered in my little brain Zeppelin.  Black Sabbath.  We have something in common.  I was a big Sabbath fan when I first started getting into music.  Village People, you knew the songs, you heard them a lot, but it wasn't like, I need to 
[00:33:00]  buy their albums.  He must have been an AM listening person.  Oh my God, they're coming to the Nassau Coliseum.  I got to wait in line and get my ticket.  Why would you get into that band?  The two concerts in the 70s my dad took me to were Kiss at the Garden and the Village  People.  And did you realize looking around what was in the audience?  I don't remember it, dude.  I didn't even know they were gay.  I had no idea.  I mean, you know, Felipe Rose, the Indian I probably would have realized was gay.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[00:33:30]  You know the names of the...  I know a couple of the names.  Felipe Rose and, you know, Victor Willis, the lead singer.  Oh, man.  Who doesn't know that?  I am what I am.  I mean, I should have known that that was a gay song.  Oh my God.  Club Soda Kenny.  Hi, Kenny.  I didn't even know you entered the studio, Kenny.  Hello, everybody.  How are you?  I have a question for Jimmy Kins.  Sure.  Why would you be coming into the city today?  I just, I'm just wondering.  To see your lovely face.  Ah.  Why don't you raise the mic up instead of hunching over there?  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. 
[00:34:00]  I have to raise the mic up to the ceiling.  Look at him.  I'm starting to think there might be something going on today, Anthony.  C.A., why am I gay?  Now, I wanted to ask Jimmy Kins at that concert.  Is that where you learned how to rub up against people?  No, I don't remember.  Oh, Frottage?  I engaged in Frottage in high school, it's called.  Frottage.  I actually almost got thrown out of school because I did it to a teacher.  Will you bump into a girl's ass with your hand and you see if you can get both cheeks?  I did it to Miss...  I don't want to say your last name.  Wow.  I did it to a teacher.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's called Frottage?  Frottage is the actual fetish of rubbing your cock on people. 
[00:34:30]  I would do that all the time.  And one time I did it to a teacher in the pool area.  Miss Dunn, her name was.  Wait, you were trying to rub your cock on two cheeks?  Or your hand, whatever you could get.  Getting over that butt crack is a...  Cheek, I used to go home and whack off thinking about how many cheeks I got.  And I got Miss Dunn.  We were in the pool area.  I walked by.  It was just me and her walking by and I just grazed.  It was called grazing.  I grazed her ass and I felt her spin and glare at me and I just kept walking.  Oh, you little creep.  And it was your...  Yeah.  You definitely got her with your junk, not your hand? 
[00:35:00]  No, no, no.  My hand.  My hand.  Which was worse.  It was like I grabbed her ass.  Yeah.  In the back of my hand, both knuckles across and the little slope.  Cheek, crack, cheek.  A little better than him.  Leaving some chocolate treat he just ate on our butt.  My high school...  Little telltale fingerprints.  My high school was known for ETs.  What were those?  Elbow tits.  Oh.  That's too violent.  You couldn't get a good feel with an ETs.  No, it wasn't like a...  You can't get a feel with an elbow either.  No, it was as soft as possible, too.  I mean, even just the elbow is a hard bone, I'm saying.  Just walking by, you just, you know, walk with your elbows a little higher. 
[00:35:30]  That's all.  Dude, I used to love...  It was a weird thing in my high school.  Everyone used to talk about it.  Wow.  The ETs.  Did you get an ETs today?  My favorite girl was Liz.  She was a senior.  I was a freshman.  I used to always try to bump into her because she was juicy, man.  I would look at girls and just figure I'd have to graze her somehow.  They would probably all know and go, oh, here comes that creepy Jimmy kid.  Do you still do that?  No.  No.  It's actually...  I'll avoid it now.  It feels too violating.  No.  I don't do that at all anymore.  Ever. 
[00:36:00]  What the hell was that?  So, the village people.  That's...  They were good lives.  Sister Sledge.  We Are Family was a big hit.  Who didn't enjoy Sister Sledge?  Did you have village people posters in your room?  I might have.  I don't remember.  Oh, my God.  I don't remember.  Who'd you dress up like?  No, I didn't dress up.  Oh, that would have been cute.  No, I didn't.  Jimmy went dressed up like a little cowboy or something.  No, I was...  I think Glenn was one of the guys, too.  I don't remember all their names.  Of course, it was Glenn.  There was the construction worker, of course.  But I didn't know they were gay.  I didn't get it.  I didn't know village meant 14th Street to Houston. 
[00:36:30]  I mean, I didn't realize that.  You thought it was like a village.  Like a village of cool people.  Right.  Remember when all men worked and sang?  Cool people.  They were cool.  The Indian was my favorite.  Growing up, the Indian was my favorite.  I thought he was the coolest.  Yeah.  Dude, I was about 10 and I knew they were gay.  And I didn't even know what gay meant.  No, I was very young.  I didn't understand.  I didn't know that.  I just knew that's not how they dress when they're out on the street doing those professions.  I didn't know.  Other things add up, though.  The monster rain, this, the playing asteroids for a record. 
[00:37:00]  I was a weirdo.  You were a weird little kid.  Don't say was.  I used to fantasize.  That bothers me that you think there's a was in that sentence.  Kiss were my heroes, bro.  Kiss in the 70s.  Well, Kiss was all our heroes.  And I used to fantasize.  I bought every Kiss album.  So did I.  Well, it was bought for me.  But I used to fantasize about Kiss.  Not sexually, but they would come to my house.  I had a problem that they wore makeup.  I was a little uncomfortable with the Kiss makeup thing.  No, that's why I liked them.  That's why, because they were like superheroes.  They were like superheroes.  I got to hear this fantasy.  That they would come.  This was a recurring one.  That Kiss would come to my apartment and hurt me and kick me down the stairs and beat me. 
[00:37:30]  And then hug me and love me and make me feel better.  You're kidding.  No.  To please tell me.  Oh, no.  That was a recurring fantasy.  It was never sexual, though.  It was about like, I don't know why I associated it.  Because I had a pretty normal household.  I always associated that uncomfortability with love.  Yeah.  Have you ever met his parents?  They're very nice, normal people.  They're the nicest people you'll ever meet.  Never abusive.  They were just, they were really great to grow up with.  So where did this come from?  Oh, my dad drank a little abusive. 
[00:38:00]  Why would you have this fantasy?  I don't know.  Kiss comes to your house.  Now, do they knock or are they just there?  I don't remember.  I can just remember my steps in my house and picturing Paul and Gene and all of them loving  me and making me feel better and hugging me and telling me I was a good boy.  But they're the ones that beat you.  That's the oddness of it.  I don't know where it's.  Look, why would I fantasize about, why would my little play, my favorite play friend?  I had two play friends growing up.  One was a middle-aged woman named Helen with a beehive hairdo.  I don't know where that came from.  That was one of my imaginary friends.  Imaginary friend. 
[00:38:30]  Named Helen.  Helen.  Yeah, with a beehive hairdo.  And one was a...  Keep tabs on all this, people.  You'll be tested.  One was a little boy who looked, who was me.  But he wore a cape, and his name was Jimmy Robinson.  And me...  And me...  I can't absorb all this stuff.  You're going too quickly.  It's all true.  I want to remember all of this.  And me and Jimmy Robinson hated Jimmy Norton.  That I remember.  You know...  Wait, wait.  You and Jimmy Robinson...  My fantasy friend was Jimmy Robinson, but it was me.  In a cape. 
[00:39:00]  But how could you and him hate you?  Gee, I don't know.  That was just the fantasy that I would play with Jimmy Robinson.  And Jimmy Norton was another fantasy character.  I mean, so there's psychologists all over the Tri-State area writing this down.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Split personality crap.  No, no, no.  I don't think it was split personality.  It was just this weird self-esteem stuff.  And you and him hate him.  Did you talk to Jimmy Robinson?  Oh, yeah.  I remember.  My only memory of, like, a vivid...  Jimmy Robinson!  My only memory...  Because I thought he was cool from Lost in Space.  Will Robinson.  Will Robinson.  Jimmy Robinson.  So my only real memory of Jimmy Robinson was him riding a tricycle, 
[00:39:30]  which was me with his cape on, flowing behind him.  That's how young I was.  I don't know where it came from.  Did it say anything on your cape?  No.  It was just a plain cape, as all cool people have.  You don't have a J-R on your chest?  No, no, no, no.  Bum, bum, bum.  I think you were touched at a very, very young age.  It's very possible, dude.  I mean, very.  Like, under five.  There's other things that contribute to self-esteem, too.  It's not necessarily that.  It doesn't always have to be that.  You know, I'm just going to throw this out there,  because I know it's a hacky radio bit, but I don't know. 
[00:40:00]  Would you ever go under hypnosis?  I've tried already.  On our show?  No.  I can't be hypnotized.  They tried on Tough Crowd recently, because there was a really funny idea.  I don't know what they were going to have me do,  but they were going to hypnotize me to do something,  and then Patrice, they were going to try to hypnotize.  Like, every time Colin said a certain word, Patrice would just shut up,  because he would always talk over people.  But I can't be hypnotized.  I can't relax enough.  I tried to, and the guy's like, you're getting sleepy.  Did you see him under hypnosis with, like, a real expert?  This guy was an expert.  No, I'm just saying, if we did it on the show. 
[00:40:30]  No, I can't be.  Yeah.  I'm too easily distracted.  I don't buy any of that, anyway.  Okay, now you covered Jimmy Robinson.  What about the woman now that was your playmate?  I don't know where she came from.  Helen was my playmate.  I don't know where she came from.  Helen, an older woman.  That's like a librarian.  Yes.  Was that the type of woman she was?  Yeah, she was in her, I'm picturing her right now.  After Helen Keller.  No, it wasn't after Helen Keller.  You could picture what she looked like as a real person?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She actually, maybe I saw a picture of my mother when she was very young, 
[00:41:00]  because it reminds me a little bit of my mom, like, from the 60s,  who I, you know, obviously was before I was born.  But Helen had a beehive hairdo, frosted,  and she was my imaginary friend, was Helen.  I don't know why.  I love this stuff, man.  It's completely true.  It is insane.  That's bizarre.  Every day I learn a little more about what just a little creep you are.  Just a frightening little messed up kid.  I love it.  Stop with the were, were, the was.  No, no, you know what it is?  Were and was is fine, because now he's an adult who makes his own decisions. 
[00:41:30]  It's based on, you know, what he wants to do.  He's a freewheeling guy.  If he wants to buy hookers and have him crap on him, that's fine.  You're an adult.  As a kid, it's creepy.  Because kids do things like play with their friends, with toys.  They enjoy Christmas.  They enjoy their parents.  They enjoy, they don't make up little playmates that are them with capes  and little school marm type playmates that are 15 friggin years old with beehive hairdos.  They don't play Monster Rain. 
[00:42:00]  They don't, they don't enjoy the village people.  It's just a creepy little thing.  The village people, the only thing you're wrong about is the village people.  Because they were very big back then.  And again, when you're that young, you don't recognize, they were like, makeup, they had  the costumes.  I love Kiss for that reason, too.  There you go.  Oh, the Kiss beating story?  That's odd, yeah.  I don't think we could find another listener that grew up listening to the village people.  I guarantee you can't.  No way.  Dude, they were in the 70s, man.  They were huge.  I would hear them when I'm driving, you know, my mother and I would listen.  We all knew who they were, but you didn't become a fan of the village people. 
[00:42:30]  You just didn't.  Well, back then it was a whole.  There was not one person in my high school that went around saying, you know, he liked the village  because there was a disco rock split back then.  I didn't know about that.  I was a little too young.  How old were you in high school, junior or whatever?  How old were the village people popular?  78?  So I was 10.  All right.  He's 10 years old.  So it's different, you know.  I was 11 when I saw it.  My father took me to see Kiss in the Garden, I think Cheap Trick opened, in December 16th  of 79 on the Alive 2 tour.  I could even buy that you're 10 and you're a village people fan not knowing, you know. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  That's fine.  The Kiss thing, you'd be a Kiss fan, that's fine.  But you would be a Kiss fan without the images of them beating you up and then coddling you  and saying it's all going to be okay.  And hugging.  I told you, I got my picture with Kiss recently.  The first time I'd ever met, I mean, with Gene, I was starstruck.  You were scared you were going to get bitch slapped by Paul Stanley.  Dude, when he, when he, how do you allow Paul Stanley to bitch slap?  He didn't bitch slap.  Oh, and the thing, he put it behind the, behind the, behind the, in your fantasy, did he hold  your head close to his puffy hair chest?  No, dude, it wasn't about sexual stuff.  Hello, everybody!  Dude, he, we're going to cuddle Jimmy Norton! 
[00:43:30]  He, from behind me, I, the photo, you can see the photo, I'm standing there, he reaches  around behind me and puts his arm on my chest.  This is last November, I tilted my head and put it on his bicep.  It was like a childhood hero thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was like, I almost, I almost held his arms, I didn't do it.  It was your fantasy come true.  It wasn't about sex, you know, I don't want to touch Paul Stanley, but it was like, I,  it was like a superhero.  That's another part of the weirdness.  Hero lights up for you to touch him.  Yeah, probably.  That's another part of the weirdness.  If you said you, you had some kind of physical attraction and it was a sexual thing, it would 
[00:44:00]  be disgusting to me, but, but the, the thing is, it's creepy that you just wanted them  to say, you know, to, to like your company and love you and be my friend and hug me.  Yeah, and beating you.  After kicking me down the steps and beating me up.  That is so weird.  Oh.  I got to play the Monster Rain thing.  We're not taking a break, but Monster Rain, the commercial by Laszlo.  Yeah.  From GTA.  It's not in GTA, but Laszlo decided to put this together for us. 
[00:44:30]  Check it out.  He was just the boy next door.  Mikey, where are you?  It's the game for kids that's sweeping the country.  Give me, what are you doing?  Jesus H. Christ, my little baby!  Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  The game you play under the porch.  Monster Rain. 
[00:45:00]  I like that one, man.  It's hilarious.  That is bizarre, though, man.  Yeah, I know.  It's a little odd.  I admit it.  I don't know where it comes from or what it is.  I don't know.  Jimmy Robinson.  The cape.  Well, here's a guy that also listens to the village people.  I'm stupefied today.  Steve, what's up?  I'm using Steve because I ain't going to give him my real name.  I've got to back up, Jim.  I honestly listen to the village people.  How old are you?  I mean, all right, listen. 
[00:45:30]  We all heard them on the radio.  I mean, did you consider yourself a fan?  Yep.  How old were you?  So weird.  Two years older than you, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah, you were 12, 13.  I mean, that's pretty normal.  They were kind of cool guys, you thought, back then.  Very long.  Like I said, I'm saying Steve because I'm in Brooklyn.  Live and sleazy.  You know, that was a good song when you were young.  I only know a couple of the hits.  That's about it.  In the Navy?  Well, in the Navy, I know.  YMCA, obviously everybody knows, but there's a couple of...  Macho Man? 
[00:46:00]  You can't go to a wedding without hearing like YMCA or something at the end of the night.  And the Yankees...  That awful grounds crew.  The grounds crew will come out and...  What's that stand for with the village people?  Young men carry AIDS?  Chris from Boston.  Hey, guys, can you picture little Jim in his little Kiss Army makeup with a little black tear running down his face after getting his ass kicked by grown men in cat makeup? 
[00:46:30]  I never dressed up like Kiss.  No.  Never wore the Kiss makeup.  Oh, well, that fixes everything.  It would almost be sacrilegious.  I felt that I couldn't...  Really?  Yeah.  No, I never dressed up like Kiss.  You were a huge Kiss fan then.  Beyond.  Dude, my father did my tickets six months in advance, and we were almost in the top row in the garden.  That's how...  Kiss in the 70s was bigger than anybody is today.  And with the night of the concert, like, this is a big thing.  It was going to be amazing.  Dude, I was a god in the neighborhood.  No one else could get tickets.  They're like, Jimmy's going to see Kiss.  This is in August.  In December, he's going to see Kiss.  Yeah.  I couldn't believe my dad got me tickets. 
[00:47:00]  Tell him to get out from under the porch.  It's time to go to Kiss.  Maybe there's another reason you were a god in the neighborhood.  Sucking all their wieners.  You'd think you would get better tickets for all the sucking you did as a kid.  Oh, my god.  I still didn't tell you about the brother and sister that I used to have sit on my face  so I could smell their pee-stay and underwear.  I'll tell you about that someday.  Oh, jeez.  Considering the show really blows today, maybe you should pull that one out of your back pocket.  Yeah.  I can't say their names, but when I was that young.  Why the brother, too?  Again, it wasn't the sex.  It was just the smell of piss. 
[00:47:30]  It wasn't him sexually.  Was it you or Jimmy Robinson?  It was, unfortunately, Jimmy Norton.  I'd love to blame that one on Helen, but I think she was trying to ixnay on the face-sitting A.  But, no, it wasn't about you.  I was attracted to the sister, actually.  That was the girl that was naked one time in front of me, and I loved her ass so much  I was sitting next to some sticker bushes.  And I'm like, you can either sit in my lap or sit in the sticker bushes.  And she sat in the sticker bushes, which destroyed my little self-esteem.  And how old were you?  Again, second, third grade.  I moved out of that neighborhood, Halloween of fourth grade, which is the very beginning 
[00:48:00]  of fourth grade.  So anything I'm talking about, this stuff, all happened before Halloween of fourth grade.  All of it.  Yeah.  And a brother and sister.  Not at the same time, but yeah.  Not at the same time.  They both would pee their pants.  I imagine they had a wonderful upbringing.  Not at the same time.  No, I mean, it wasn't some weird.  And it wasn't even a sexual thing.  It wasn't some weird.  He started saying, see, we could almost let you off the hook if it was them together.  Because then you could say, well, I did it because the sister, I don't know.  But that means you were just under the porch with the guy. 
[00:48:30]  No, no.  This was behind the bushes.  Behind the bushes.  And what would you say?  Take off your pants?  No, no, no.  With pants on.  No, it was never nude.  Oh, all pants on.  The only one I wanted to see nude was his sister, who I had a real crush on.  I would love to take a blacklight to his childhood home, behind the bushes, under the porch.  You'd say, sit on my face?  Don't remember how it would go.  I honestly don't remember.  I can just remember liking the smell.  Yeah, there's got to be a beginning to that, though.  I'm sure there is.  It probably happened during wrestling, and I'd pretend to lose.  I don't know.  Oh, got you.  Do not know. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Let's...  But the girl I really had a crush on.  She was a year older than me.  So glad we're getting the gay out of the show.  Where is she buried now?  Sharing the life and love.  An Opie and Anthony family special.  Hello, friends.  Jerry Springer with you.  From the very beginning of his tenure at the Opie and Anthony show, young Sam's ethnicity  has been in question.  So he decided to bring in his family tree to help shed some light on this dark subject.  No pun intended. 
[00:49:30]  Has anyone ever, like, done that family tree thing, by the way?  Hmm.  You discover that your family's just filled with, like, alcoholics and stuff.  With nothing?  With nothingness.  That you're looking for some kind of greatness, some night, or something, and it's just nothing?  Just nothing.  The bread cart guy during the plague?  My great-great-great-grandfather was a bootlegger.  Oh, great.  You weren't, like, a pirate in your family or something cool?  Wasn't everyone a bootlegger back at the turn of the century?  You get nothing out of it. 
[00:50:00]  What do you do a family tree with?  Huh?  What do you do to get a family tree?  There's all kinds of software.  You go online and...  And you find out nothing.  You give them money and they tell you that, you know, a couple of dagos got on a boat and  came over here.  Right.  It's about the size of it.  Although our own Sam, the intern there, is related to Thomas Jefferson.  Thomas Jefferson, so he says.  So he says he brought in his family tree.  Oh, shit.  Where's mine?  He brought in his family tree.  I can't read it.  Why weren't copies made?  Why don't I have a... 
[00:50:30]  Why don't I have...  I am Sam.  Where is Sam?  This is his family tree?  Yeah.  Thanks, Hawk.  Thomas Jefferson.  What?  He went to get food.  He went to get food, so when...  Miles Standish.  President Thomas Jefferson is our intern Sam's great, great, great, great, great, great first  cousin.  First cousin.  How does it work?  This family tree is really stupid. 
[00:51:00]  It's very confusing.  I can't read it.  There's numbers.  Miles Standish is his great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,  great grandfather.  Who the hell was Miles Standish?  Miles Standish, the Mayflower.  What?  Came over on the Mayflower.  What, what, what, what?  He was the head muckety-muck.  All right.  On the Mayflower.  All righty.  Are you kidding me?  Wow, this guy's got some blood in him.  Is he Samuel Wood Roberts?  Is that who he is?  Go to the beginning.  Because I see number one, he's related to William the Conqueror, the King of England? 
[00:51:30]  Stop it.  Where is that?  Number 31.  And then father.  Get out of here.  How could you have this many really cool people in your family?  Right.  This is not really.  I love this.  This guy comes from royalty, and he's getting us our Starbucks coffee today.  William the Conqueror.  He comes from William the Conqueror.  And he's, like, conquering Starbucks.  Hey, faggot, conquer that fat free muffin. 
[00:52:00]  Wait on why with the rest of us.  Is William the Conqueror conquering?  Speaking of miles, walk a few to get me a crispy apple, bitch.  I think we've got to give this Sam guy a little more respect, Anthony.  Sam.  Jesus.  Samuel.  Yeah.  He's also related to George Harrison.  Where's that?  The George Harrison?  The George Harrison. 
[00:52:30]  Where?  Number 10.  Or some other guy named George Harrison.  Well, I don't know.  It's somewhere between William the Conqueror and Thomas Jefferson.  It's also related to Mary Hart.  But I think this is bullshit.  I think he paid money to have this done.  And if you pay money, you pay enough money, you'll get good relatives.  You have to go to tiredofbeingazilch.com.  Right.  Yeah, you know, bring up a good point.  If you're going to go down this road and you're going to pay people, you've got to think these  people are going to have to give you someone cool. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  And your lineage.  Of course.  William the Conqueror.  King of England.  Matilda of Germany.  All right.  Henry the Second King of England.  Mm-hmm.  Pretty impressive.  Henry the Third.  Of course, he'd be related to all of them.  Because they're all related.  Are they?  Yeah.  All right.  I want to get my family tree now.  This is exciting.  Oh, that would be hilarious.  Sir and Baron Andrew Windsor. 
[00:53:30]  A Baron.  I want my family tree.  You do?  I know the Pierce's we were related to, they brought ice cream into Jersey City.  That's nobody.  No, that's pretty...  Here's Sam.  I am Sam.  There he is.  What's up, Sam?  Hi, everybody.  You're not related to William the Conqueror.  Yeah, isn't he right at the top there?  I swear to God, that tree is legit.  That wasn't legit.  I swear to God.  We, on a family reunion a few years ago, they put out this book that, like, this big, thick book 
[00:54:00]  that has all these trees laid out by all the divisions.  And my dad, who's now an avid listener, was listening the day that you guys had me on,  talking about, you know, bringing some Thomas Jefferson stuff or something.  So that day, he went through the book and actually typed that out, and then...  Yeah, but it's confusing.  I know.  That's why I had to make the notes on it, because...  Now, I'm looking at this.  Mm-hmm.  Is this, uh... 
[00:54:30]  Because I see mother of, father of, blah, blah, blah, in the first column.  Yeah.  But then there's none of that here, in the second column, where Thomas Jefferson is.  Right.  The second column is, uh...  The second, uh, third, fourth columns are extended generation.  It seems to split after Peter Field Jefferson on both of those, and then goes to John Robert  Jefferson.  So, is this, like, maybe one side of the family, and then the other side? 
[00:55:00]  This is all my dad's side.  This is all your dad's side.  So, uh, so, Thomas Jefferson II is right there.  This is just the, uh, mother and father of...  So, Thomas Jefferson II would be the grandfather, uh, making the president of Thomas Jefferson  the first cousin.  The great, great, great, great, great, great first cousin.  I'll say he is.  Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island, is number 13. 
[00:55:30]  That's pretty cool.  And now, Miles Standish.  Yep.  That, this looks like a pretty straightforward family tree thing here.  Right.  He would be the grandfather, the great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.  So now, Miles Standish is the father of Josias Standish.  Is that what I'm...  Uh, yeah, that's what it looks like.  Um...  And then that's the father of Mercy Standish, the father of Mary Well...  Wheel Lock?  Yes.  Wheel Lock.  They had great names back then. 
[00:56:00]  What did you earn the last name?  I don't know.  Looks at a Wheel Lock.  Wheel Lock?  You just pick them.  And then that, that, that, and then it goes to your father and you.  Right.  Wow.  That's pretty impressive.  That's it.  That's the way to treat...  And, uh...  I feel bad that you're getting our stuff for us.  Really?  They were looking for black blood in there somewhere.  And my mom was, uh...  Because it's not there, you know, because Thomas Jefferson is a cousin, so it's not...  His blood is not...  So, uh, my mom was trying to go through her family tree, but my mom's family gets a little 
[00:56:30]  shady at points, so they can't exactly trace back...  More ways than one.  There's a lot of shade on her side.  They can't trace it all the way, uh, back terribly far.  Well, that's why I'm amazed that you get this far back.  With a family tree, because I know I could probably go back to my great-grandfather,  and then it would just get lost in some vendetta somewhere in Sicily.  It gets really shady after those trips to Oakland. 
[00:57:00]  That's very cool, Sam.  But, yeah, that's the tree.  Do you have any memorabilia from these people?  No, I mean, there's got to be something somewhere in the family, and...  William the Conqueror's sword or something?  Wouldn't that be cool?  If I can find anything at all, I will absolutely bring it in.  Do you see any paintings of William the Conqueror?  No.  What did he look like?  Was he a big fella?  I have no clue.  My dad handed me that, and he's like, yeah, no.  William the Conqueror...  I would so be researching William the Conqueror.  Died in 1087.  What did he do?  What did he conquer? 
[00:57:30]  Well, Bill, um, he was, uh, he was better known as, uh, Duke of Normandy, actually.  Is that it?  He was William the Bastard.  His rule was stern.  Ooh.  Ah, ooh, tell him, Fred.  My rule was stern.  Is laced with, uh, faced with many battles.  The most famous was October 14th, 1066.  He led the Normans to defeat the English forces in the celebrated Battle of Hastings.  Wow.  On Christmas Day, he was crowned the King of England in the famed Westminster Abbey. 
[00:58:00]  Wow.  This guy was like, uh, the real deal.  Oh, yeah.  An OG.  Are you allowed to just...  Like a real OG.  Are you allowed to just go to the Westminster Abbey and say, hey, I'm related to the dude?  You know, I've never tried, but I gotta assume, yeah, I'll just bring the tree.  That little printout.  That would be, like, pretty good.  You're royalty.  I, um, fast forward a thousand years.  Who was, who was, uh, young Sam the intern?  Well, it says here he would get muffins and coffee for a man with... 
[00:58:30]  How do you do?  I'm Sam.  This is pretty, uh, rude.  The twisted part of William the Conqueror's death.  He died September 9th, 1087, at the age of 60 years old.  Within minutes, the servant stole everything from his residence.  Jeez.  Including his clothes and left his swollen, lifeless body naked on the floor.  That's where you get the black...  Oh! 
[00:59:00]  There.  There you go.  There's your proof, buddy.  An obscure knight named Herloon was the first to discover William's nude body.  At his own expense, he was not a wealthy man.  He arranged for the body to be prepared for the funeral and transported to Cain.  Just before the solemn funeral procession reached the church, the cries of fire were heard.  The mourners were forced to put his coffin down and go fight a fire.  Eventually, they put the fire out, returned to the body, and continued it along its way to the church. 
[00:59:30]  The funeral was held on a blisteringly hot day.  As a result, his abscess had swelled and became putrid.  When they tried to fit William's body into a custom-made sarcophagus,  they found out it had swelled so much it wouldn't fit in.  What to do?  They squeezed him in.  They tried to push him to no avail.  Then they pushed his swollen abdominal wall.  And William the Conqueror's body burst like a popped balloon.  The pus and putrefaction drenched the king's burial garb. 
[01:00:00]  The stench filled the chapel.  The mourners raced for the door, their hands covering their noses.  Needless to say, they buried him very quickly.  That's Grandpa.  Grandpa.  Yeah, that's it.  He said what happened was he got thrown a horse through him onto the saddle's iron pommel,  which is that big knob on the front.  Ooh.  And his injuries were internal.  The saddle burst his intestines, and waste matter began to fill and poison his intestines.  Is that what happens? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, no, I was riding, and the horn of the saddle went up my ass.  Yeah, I swear, I was on a horse.  You go to the doctor with the saddle up your ass.  Pantitis.  Hmm.  Well, very good, Sam.  I couldn't fix that, I guess, back then.  There was no surgery.  He was constantly ridiculed for being a fat man.  Huh.  You're a skinny guy.  I sure am.  That's right.  I'll take after William the Conqueror.  No, sir.  So you think when the servants kind of raided the place, there's that one relative who  was slow, and then there was Kathy with a limp. 
[01:01:00]  Aha.  I see where the tree split.  Wow, that's some family traits.  Sharing the last and love, and Opie and Anthony family special.  Hello, friends.  Jerry Springer with you.  I'm going to hand it off now to Sam and Eric to tell you what's coming up after the break.  Thanks, Jerry.  Sam and E-Rock here.  Coming up after the break, the staff is going to delve into some of their mother issues.  Of course, you've got Travis, Danny, a little mention of Sam and little Eric Nagel.  The whole gang gets into the studio to talk about some of their favorite mommy issues. 
[01:01:30]  And also, one of Opie's family members calls in.  His brother, Brett, had a bit of an issue about seeing his dad naked.  Who doesn't like seeing their father's genitals?  Not me.  I know I do.  Stay tuned for sharing the laughter and love.  I'm not editing that.  An Opie and Anthony family special?  Stay.  Stay right there.  More of sharing the laughter and love, and Opie and Anthony family special coming right up. 
[01:02:00]  Welcome back to sharing the laughter and love, and Opie and Anthony family special.  Hello, everyone.  Thanks for being with us.  I'm Jerry Springer, hosting sharing the laughter and love, and Opie and Anthony family special.  In this next segment, a casual discussion turned into a confessional, when one by one, the staff revealed their mommy issues.  Danny and his mother should wrestle it out on my next pay-per-view.  Enjoy. 
[01:02:30]  Hey, we got another clip from the drunk show.  From the drunk show.  The surprise drunk show.  This is an Anthony request.  Yeah.  I liked this one.  I mean, it's a voicemail that Danny's mom...  Did you actually play the voicemail?  Yeah.  We just talked about it.  No, no, I saved the voicemail for over a year.  And you don't bring it to the show that pays your fucking...  I didn't know what to do with that.  Oh, my God.  It's for the drunk show.  Everybody is.  The problem with this show is that all the guys have radio shows.  So why would they bring stuff to the actual show that is paying their bills? 
[01:03:00]  Wait, what's the voicemail?  You had this for a year?  We could have made something out of this.  Maybe, but I never wanted to hand it in being like, oh, look at me, I want airtime, play  my stuff.  You know what I'm saying?  It just would have been weird to hand it in like that.  No one listens Saturday, don't worry.  What's the show?  No one listens.  We have the voicemail?  It's growing.  Yeah, it's in the track.  It's growing.  But...  What the fuck?  Let's hear it.  I got into an argument.  I was busting my mother's balls when I was still talking to her. 
[01:03:30]  You don't talk to her anymore?  No.  This is the last contact I've ever had with her was this voicemail being played.  But she used to hang out with us.  Yeah, she used to.  We talked about this on The Drunk Show.  Wait, how?  Yeah.  Oh, a lot of these questions are going to be answered in this clip?  Probably not.  What was the last time you...  Saw her?  Yeah.  Probably at an event somewhere.  F.H. Riley's, I remember the whole family was there.  You, your little brother, your mom was trying to pick up people.  Oh, boy.  I know. 
[01:04:00]  I know.  I think I know why the guys save stuff, to be honest.  I think that we don't use our resources well enough and go to them enough.  Like, why would Danny think she should say that and bring it in when we haven't talked  to him about his personal life in a while?  He might think, like, I don't want to be a burden.  You have that, though.  You're getting on the air right away.  It's not even a burden.  It's just like, why...  Like, who the hell's going to give a fuck about this message that my mother left me on  my voicemail?  But if it was an ongoing theme and we've been talking to Danny more, then it would be like  something like...  Like, if it was, you know, Dan's mom, then it makes sense to bring to the table. 
[01:04:30]  He's got that whole bit going, so I'm not going to...  Yeah.  I'm not going to jump in with my fucking voice now.  What the hell's wrong with you guys?  We don't like our mommies.  We like our guys that work for us to hate their moms.  That's pretty much almost across the board.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Does Travis hate his mother?  I know they don't have a good...  Yeah.  Wait, yeah.  Why?  Well, they don't have a relationship.  All right, hold on.  Everyone with a mommy issue.  Hold on, Travis.  Everyone with a mommy issue lineup.  Yeah.  We've got Dan, we've got Danny, we've got Travis. 
[01:05:00]  Who else?  Sam's got to be in love, and she makes him fish sticks or whatever.  Mother of the year, this Sam's mom.  Chicken nuggets, whatever the fuck.  Where's fucking E-Rock?  And Steve.  E-Rock?  Mommy issue?  Steve's got it.  Mom issue.  Steve's got mommy issue written all over him.  Steve, mommy issue.  Yes, I want to be one.  Travis, mommy issue?  So what's the mommy issue?  She left seven years ago.  I haven't spoken to her since.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:05:30]  Why?  Why'd she leave?  In my opinion, I think she's had like a midlife.  She had a homosexual son.  She saw the cat picture.  Don't talk about my brother.  Wait, how old, Travis, are you now?  I'm 27.  So she was 20.  You were a grown man.  Do you have younger siblings?  Yeah.  How old?  He's a year younger than me.  Okay, so you're both grown up.  And you haven't talked to your own mom in seven years?  No.  Why?  Do you know where she is?  No.  You don't even know where she is?  No.  Why'd she leave?  It can't be just a midlife crisis.  She never wanted you in the first place. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Has she tried to contact you?  Oh, no.  I was, when she left originally, I was the one keeping contact with her.  Oh, okay.  So she left and then you were still kind of keeping contact.  But she cut off contact with everyone.  Oh, okay.  Like, me, my brother, her brother.  Wow.  Everyone.  Did she start up a new family?  Yeah.  Well, what happened was she married a Jewish guy.  A Jew.  Who I think his, like, level of faith is to cut off your previous life. 
[01:06:30]  Make my day, Jew.  When you convert.  Did she convert?  Yeah.  And when you convert, I think you cut off that part of your life.  All right.  Whoa.  That is something.  That doesn't sound very Christian.  Oh.  It isn't.  He obviously has a huge cock.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  He's fucking, oh.  That's what Jewish guys are known for. 
[01:07:00]  They're giant dicks.  No, I am.  I know.  That's what makes it even more amazing.  He's knocking that fucking goyim pussy into the fucking mess.  They're all high-fiving him behind the scenes.  Oh, yeah.  This guy must be a stud in bed that she's given up everything for.  She fucking, she pretty much cocked Travis.  I guess so.  She changed gods.  Yeah.  She changed gods.  Denounced Christ.  Denounced Christ.  Got rid of her previous family all for the cock.  Renounced.  Yeah.  What does that say?  Renounced. 
[01:07:30]  Never looked at it that way.  She fucking gave up.  I like denounced.  How about pronounce?  Yeah.  How about pounce?  Like she did on that fucking Jewish fucking clipped piece of meat.  That fucking, I bet his cock is so fat it has a yarmulke.  Fucking sweaty cock head he has with a little yarmulke.  His pubes are curled like payas around his balls.  That's right.  He fucking puts a little briefcase with money and he fucking handcuffs it to his cock shaft.  He's fucking, I don't mean to be disrespectful to your mother.  No, none taken. 
[01:08:00]  But for seven years she has been taking fucking kosher seed on the fucking, on the face and  in the hair.  Sorry, man.  I became a little bit jealous.  Oh, it's his mom.  Oh, he hasn't seen her in seven years.  You know what it is?  He's only fucked religious women for.  So when he got, he got a hold of her and the way she, like, he never had a finger in  his asshole before.  But fucking boy, when, when that fucking, when that, when that fucking Christian hand  reached around, he's like, why are you putting your finger in your mouth? 
[01:08:30]  And she went, hold on a second.  Keep your hat on and I'll show you.  She's wetting her finger?  She's the first one to ever pull the sheet down and expose her big tits.  They want you to come on these, Morris.  Oh my God.  Oh, he's never had that before.  Ever.  Well, let's ask Travis.  Travis, does your mom have big tits? 
[01:09:00]  No.  Oh, damn.  I bet she got implants.  I'll bet you Morris likes big tits and she had them blown up.  She's like fucking Colonel Kurtz.  Fuck the kids.  Fuck that cat, my faggot son.  I got you, Dick.  Anything for you, Morris.  Whatever you want, Morris.  Shoot, Dick.  Tell the husbands, tell the kids.  I'm never coming back.  Are you a rabbi, Willard?  I'm a cop.  She likes that, huh? 
[01:09:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Jimmy's basically saying your mom's loose.  No, I'm saying the truth to that.  No, she was so taken.  I don't know.  Maybe.  She was so taken.  Yeah.  Like, so, like, you know what I mean?  It's like a lot of times you're a mom and you fucking, you know, you go through that crisis.  She's probably never had it like that.  I'll bet you if you read her diary, the first entrance was, oh, oh, my God.  Oh, my former God.  Oh, my you-know-who.  Florida Steve from Washington, D.C. writes, she screams, I want to taste my ass. 
[01:10:00]  I never had anyone go ass to mouth before.  Oh, Travis.  Oh, no.  Seven years, you got married, and she didn't see you get married, huh?  No.  Does that bother you?  No.  Come on, a little bit's gotta hurt.  No.  You must have not had a great relationship growing up with your mom, then.  No, that's the thing, is that we had a great relationship.  Oh, no.  No, she was like the mom, you know, like, that you want to have. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, I think my brother is more affected than I am.  What did daddy do to your mom?  Nothing.  Did you ever call her and say, what the fuck happened to you?  Did they get a divorce, obviously?  Mm-hmm.  At what age?  I was 20.  Wait, divorce, and then gone?  Yeah.  So she, like, disowned you guys before she, you know, hooked up with this guy, unless she  was seeing this guy.  We don't know.  Oh, you say you don't know.  But it was all very quick.  I'm sure it was sneaky.  Did she was pregnant?  No.  I don't believe that you're not hurt, though. 
[01:11:00]  That's a very devastating thing, because all of a sudden she's gone.  No, I dealt with it a long time ago.  Did you ever call her and just go, what the fuck did you need for?  Painting swastikas on synagogues?  How did you deal with it?  When she left, yeah, all the time.  Nothing.  But I mean, now, like, seven years later.  That's all right.  No.  Like, how could you fucking reject your children?  No, I will probably get in touch with her one day.  Right now, my hands are like...  Oh, no, you will?  Well, I figure I will one day, but not right now.  What was her answer when you say, where'd you go?  Oh, that it's none of my business.  Hole.  Hole.  Really?  Yeah.  How about it is?  Well, yeah, exactly, because when they were going through their divorce, I would try and 
[01:11:30]  cry in front of them to make it stop.  Well, he, the man that she married, luckily for her, was a divorce lawyer.  Oh, a lawyer!  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  So, uh, he got it into her head.  He sure did.  She...  Oh, your son wears a sweater with a hood?  Why would you want to go back to that?  Is he a boy or a girl? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, he had her fucking face in legal pads.  You know, the first time she ever squirted when she came was with her fucking face on  a yellow legal pad.  Oh, my God.  I never had liquid come out before.  Is that pee?  Is that pee?  She panicked.  She thought she pissed at her leg.  I'm sorry, Travis.  I know what you're talking about.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  She thought she fucking pissed into her pantyhose and all over her shoes. 
[01:12:30]  Never seen such a thing.  Fred Ziffel writes the term ATM means something totally different to Morris.  Oh, she knew it, too.  She would talk dirty.  She'd go, oh, fuck me like you're representing my husband.  Oh, fuck me like you're representing him.  Fuck me like you're Dominic Barbera.  I'm a fucking guinea radio host.  Oh, when you pull your cock out, I want half my bank account to be attached to it.  Fuck me, Morris. 
[01:13:00]  Morris.  Dickie Punchcock from Wack Bag Rikey.  Dickie Punchcock.  I bet she likes it in the Dirty Star of David.  Oh, no.  Let's see.  Ryan from Cleveland.  Does she stick dreidel beans in her ass?  Yeah.  He tore a new asshole.  Oh, and he pulled his dick out of her ass and there was a little menorah.  Stephen S. from Bayshore writes, they're coming in too quick now. 
[01:13:30]  Good God.  So quick, I can't find it anymore.  Oh, well.  Oh, I guess Travis is wishing the tally had been six million and one.  Oh.  Oh.  Now we're getting into the gray area here, aren't we?  I guess we're going to have to fire Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Sorry, Stephen.  Sorry.  Wow, Travis, what the fuck?  Do you think your dad did something that was pretty wrong that made it go like this? 
[01:14:00]  No.  Really?  Yep.  What's your dad do now?  What does he do now?  Right now, he's the head of the Ku Klux Klan.  No.  He's looking for Simon Wiesenthal.  He's the head of the Nazi Party of America.  Yeah.  He's in radio.  My dad, Ivan Demienyuk.  He's a Detroit autoworker.  Travis's dad is in radio.  Did we know this?  Really?  No.  What's he do?  Travis Stern. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, wow.  He runs a station in Jersey.  He runs a station in Jersey.  What station?  I'd rather not say.  Oh, boy.  How do we not know this?  Don't tell me it's the FM talker.  No, Jim knows.  How do we not know this?  Let me take a look at this.  Oh, I actually liked that station a lot.  Let me see.  There you go.  Yeah, yeah, I did.  I used to like it.  I don't know what it is. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, no, I don't know.  My first radio request was made to that station.  That's how I know.  Um, and, uh, I asked him to play The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, and they never did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No wonder.  Maybe the guy's name was Edmund Fitzgerald.  The Wreck of the...  Oi!  And I suck it deep down in her asshole.  She came...  And she came like, Link, get your goody.  Could you work pink sock into this, please?  Please work pink sock into this. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, let's see.  I gave her jaw a good knock and her ass a pink sock, and I wiped my dick on her son's sweater.  Off the cuff.  Sorry.  On his hoodie.  Oh, poor Travis.  Dickie Punchcock is rocking today.  One more from Dickie, please.  Like a little Travis with the cat.  Do you see the picture of him, Jimmy?  I know.  He's so tussleable.  I know.  Let me get this in.  Let's center out.  Let me get one more from Dickie Punchcock in, please.  Dickie Punchcock? 
[01:16:00]  He eats her ass because it smells like pennies.  Oh, shit.  Well, you know what the thing was, too?  That he's used to probably deep fucking and getting them to squirt because he hits like...  He does what they call hits rock bottom.  Like, I bet you the first thing she said when...  I mean, again, I'm trying to phrase this properly.  Like, the first thing while she was bent over and he fucking deep-dicked her, where she probably went like...  I never knew a cock could go that deep.  Oh, my God.  He's hit rock bottom. 
[01:16:30]  Wow.  Hey, the guy's...  No pussies as tight as my wallet?  The guys are trying to guess the call letters of the station that Travis's wallet is on.  WCKLD.  That's cuckold.  That's what this guy's got.  Oh, really?  I'm not even reading it.  You're going to be pissed.  John from Virginia is going to be mad.  John, I can't see feedback from here.  No, he can't.  Very good, Jimmy.  You nailed that one.  All right.  Oh, Danny. 
[01:17:00]  We go to Danny's mother issues.  Anything else you want to add to this, Travis?  No.  I mean, this is all...  You say you want to search her out at some point, though?  Well, Jim asked if I want to get in touch with her.  Yeah, and you do.  No, not that I do right now, but I assume that later on in life...  Why would you even assume that, though?  Well, you've got to assume at this point she's got a seven-year-old that is named Travis.  Maybe.  Why would they ask you to reject your former life?  Without having any feelings or anything, you wouldn't even consider that the future might hold this reunion.  Is this a hopeful thing? 
[01:17:30]  No.  To be honest with you, it's not something that I think about.  How could you not hate her guts, even if you made up with her, like, because she left her...  I would more like to get in touch with her to find out, like, because, you know, that affected me so much when it was happening.  Yeah.  You know?  Not the divorce or not the remarriage, but the rejection of you and your brother.  Yeah, just the rejection of everyone.  Like, she hasn't spoken to her own brother in seven years.  Wow.  You know?  Did you, um...  When you were growing up, did you think she was a little off?  No. 
[01:18:00]  Wow, so fucked up.  You never saw anything, like...  Nothing.  A little different?  ...would indicate that she was gonna...  No, nobody did.  Was she like the regular mom?  Yeah, absolutely.  God damn.  Boy.  Boy.  You never really look at the Jewish people as the ones that kind of come in and...  No.  ...sweep a woman away like that.  Drowned victim from Jersey writes, uh, this is what he thinks the radio station call letters are.  W, my mom left me for cut cock.  That's a little long. 
[01:18:30]  I don't think the FCC allows that.  Put that on a bumper sticker.  Oh my God, that's it.  No offense to your dad, but he's unclipped.  Oh my God, that's it.  It was the first...  She actually...  The first thing she said was,  Oh my God, it tastes so clean.  Oh fuck.  Jimmy.  I'm just teasing.  Don't even look at him, Jimmy.  I can't.  Yeah, you really can't.  He's right there, too.  Very bent.  Don't look to the right.  He's right there. 
[01:19:00]  I can't.  I have a voicemail.  Yes.  It's not about you, douchebag.  We got enough air time last weekend, Danny.  Oh, shit.  All right, what do we got, Danny?  So we got the...  This is audio...  Travis, we're not going to forget that one anytime soon.  No, no.  All right, hey, so Anthony did the surprise drunk show with Danny?  No, it was just the drunk...  Secret show.  Secret.  Oh, mine is the surprise show.  Right.  That I decide I'm not doing because it's your thing.  Yeah.  Secret drunk show.  Secret drunk show. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Here's another clip from Saturday night.  She had two fur coats.  Why would you need that?  Two.  Because she's a cunt.  Oh.  So anyway, the last time...  When you call your mom that...  Douchebagos!  That's just going to escalate into mental fucking problems later in life.  And I never want to bring this up or anything.  I don't want to, like...  It's usually this deathbed scenario that makes that tragic. 
[01:20:00]  Because then all bets are off.  You forget about the awful shit.  You're just sitting there going,  Okay, here's a loved one dropping dead.  And I have years now of regret that I'm going to have to fucking sift through.  Oh, fuck.  Are you in a...  Your future stinks!  Well, you know what?  Maybe.  Perhaps.  Yeah.  But the voicemail...  And it wasn't even left to me.  And this is the best part about this probably whole story.  But the voicemail was actually left to my father. 
[01:20:30]  And my father felt the need to call me and leave this for me.  Because he liked it so much on my voicemail.  Nice one.  Fits more beer.  I'm almost done with this bottle.  It's a little pissy at the bottom.  Sorry, I think we have that queued up.  Hey, Dave.  It's Sue.  It's about a quarter to one.  I know you're in school.  But when you do get a chance, please call me back.  Because I had this conversation with Danny and I basically told him to fuck off. 
[01:21:00]  And I just want to tell you about it.  Because he's the cruelest, the cruelest, heartless, cold person that I've ever known in my life.  I can't even believe he came out of me.  I really can't.  Bye-bye.  Holy shit.  Dude.  Where's the tears behind that laughter?  Where are the fucking tears behind that laughter?  Dude, none.  That is probably the worst message you could hear from your mom.  That sounds like something.  Hold on.  Plug it up for a second.  She could say, no, let's just talk over it. 
[01:21:30]  Then it sounds like we were there.  It reminds me of a voicemail I heard that Travis's mother left.  It's like, oh my God, I have to deny that he ever came out of me.  Is that inappropriate?  Sorry, Travis.  I feel fucking bad.  Oh, and you should.  Poor Travis.  Such a little innocent boy.  That's why he's hiding behind that beard.  I know.  Know what I noticed on that little clip?  The wife?  Is that what you call it?  The beard?  What I noticed on that clip is that your mom sounds very, like, hot. 
[01:22:00]  Courtney Love hot.  No, she's not.  She's got like a Courtney Love hot to her voice.  No.  Well, she was very emotional because that was, she probably left that message for my dad  maybe no more than five minutes after me and her just had a huge blow up on the phone.  Like, it was just done.  I was like, you know what?  What does a son and a mother argue about at this point in your life?  Well, it had a lot to do with just the cuntiness of the divorce process and just like, my dad 
[01:22:30]  had, he was going through some rough times.  He had a heart attack, you know, had health issues.  He lost his gig.  So he was just working like shitty jobs.  And she was still trying to fuck him for every fucking cent that she could get out of him.  And she's doing way better than he is.  Yeah.  Forever.  And she's still at it because she called him.  She was still at it.  And I tried, you know, and I wasn't being, I wasn't being malicious, I guess, when I brought  it up with her, but I was just busting her balls.  Just kind of like, you know, kind of having fun with it, but it was kind of like a half,  not passive aggressive, but I was just kind of, you know, toying with her a little bit 
[01:23:00]  because I felt like I had the right to because, you know, she was trying to fuck my dad.  So she had no part of it.  That makes sense.  Wow.  Is there more to that clip?  Yeah, it's probably nothing.  Message you could hear from your mom.  There's none tears.  She could say, thank God he was adopted.  You didn't know.  Thank God he was adopted.  There's none tears.  God, I'm so sorry that abortion didn't work out.  He fucking dodged the hanger. 
[01:23:30]  That's awful.  That was the last communique I've ever had with your old mom.  That was it.  That was a while ago, too.  But she gave you birth.  She gave you life.  Oh, that's all she did, though.  She gave you life.  That's all she did.  Anybody could take cum in their pussy.  Anybody could do that.  Travis could do that.  His mom certainly can.  As long as it says, push or parvy.  It doesn't mean that you're going to be a great mom.  And it doesn't mean that I'm legally bound to love you because you took a load on my dad's birthday. 
[01:24:00]  Was it his birthday?  Yeah.  Well, let's see.  His birthday is March 19th.  My birthday is December 27th.  You do the math.  Yeah, it was a birthday fuck.  So it was a drunken fuck, you think?  Yeah, it had to be.  Oh, my God.  That's the only reason you're here?  Because of a drunken fuck?  Yeah, because my dad wanted to get laid on his birthday.  Wow.  Okay.  We did a lot today on this fine show. 
[01:24:30]  Yes, we did.  Damn.  You two.  You two.  That makes Thans' relationship with his mom look like fucking, yeah, leave it to Beaver.  Wow.  Yeah, way to kill my bitch.  I don't want to seem normal, you dick.  Just put a tone on any time you talk about it.  Sharing the life and love, an Opie and Anthony family special.  Hello again, I'm Jerry Springer.  As we continue with our special, we dive into a story that contributed the mad man we know 
[01:25:00]  today as Opie.  In this next bit, Opie's brother, Brett, calls in to share how he accidentally saw his father's  genitals at the hospital.  Curl up in a nice blanket with a loved one and enjoy.  I believe my brother's checking in, Anthony.  Yeah.  We were discussing how my brother, I believe it was last weekend, saw my dad's junk.  But I need him to tell the story. 
[01:25:30]  Hey, Brett.  Yeah.  What's up?  We doing crack, baby?  What's up, man?  Anthony.  Yeah.  I got a bone to pick with you, son.  What did I do?  My sister.  Oh, I already told Dan how pissed off you guys were.  That wasn't me.  You know, that story got so friggin' switched around.  People saying, I said stuff I never said.  I know.  The dopey listeners, the same ones that got me in trouble with my mom.  Yeah, it gets out of control around here sometimes.  It's all for fun.  So, Brett, a week ago you saw Dad's Junk? 
[01:26:00]  Ah, dude.  What?  I can't talk about this.  Well, now you got it, because they're going to think the worst now.  He's probably listening.  That's okay.  You want me to get him on the phone?  No, that's okay.  We haven't had my dad on the air yet.  He's pretty funny.  I'm still trying to get over it.  Yeah, you got to tell Ant, though.  Ant.  What happened?  He's in the VA hospital, which is one of the worst hospitals, I believe, is in the world.  It took me like three days just to find where he was.  I wandered into this room of what appeared to be 150 casualties and people everywhere. 
[01:26:30]  I hope he just spit his water out in his head.  And there's my dad in the middle, and he just had some things done to his pipe.  Sorry about that.  He just spit water all over the place.  Because my dad has been in the 150 casualties.  My dad's been in the VA hospital many times, and he just described it perfectly.  It's like a mash unit.  Yeah, because my dad goes in for some basic procedures, more or less, you know, and there's 
[01:27:00]  guys around him that it's like, yeah, it looks like they were just taken off the battlefield.  They're doing triage in the lobby.  It's like, why does my dad get lumped in with these guys?  But, you know, I think his roommate this time around had to have his leg lopped off, you  know?  Oh, man.  Almost everyone there has, well, at least a foot cut off.  It's like you can't get a minute.  Stucked on a landmine in Northport.  Yeah, you can't get a minute unless you have a foot cut off.  Everyone there.  Yes, it's really weird, because, you know, my dad's situation isn't that serious, and 
[01:27:30]  the people around him are just dying in their beds and stuff.  It's really sad, but...  All right, you described it perfectly.  Go ahead.  But I can't find him anywhere, so I'm asking nurses, and you're like, oh, him.  You know, like everyone knows about him.  So they finally point me to his room, and there he is.  I'm all worried about him.  He's got a little decatheter.  It's full of stuff, and there's about a half-inch tube running from the decatheter under the  sheet.  And I'm sitting there trying to have a conversation with him, but I can't help but keep looking  at the tube like, there's no freaking way that thing is going where I think it's going. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, because it was like a half-inch...  And it was huge.  Diameter, yeah?  It was huge.  So I'm talking to him, talking to him, and as I'm talking to him, I get all the  hyper, and I'm throwing my arms around, and I hit the tubes by accident.  He's like, oh, my tube!  Oh, no, come on!  So, I'm like, I'm so sorry.  I was like, and I, my Canadian, Mike, where's that go to?  You know?  He flips the sheets up.  His whole entire area is shaved and red and raw, and as I have a pinch tube, I'm going 
[01:28:30]  to munch them to his thing.  The whole tube?  The whole tube.  Oh, I'm getting that tingly feeling.  It hurts.  But he has all...  He's like, it goes straight to my bladder.  I don't even feel it when I'm...  I'm trying to look away, like, oh, my God.  I just threw my dad's stuff.  It was the first time ever.  It was, huh?  Yeah.  His things are hanging to his knees.  I thought, you never want to see your mother naked.  God.  Never see your father naked.  I saw Dad's Junk when we went to the Brooklyn Zoo. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, but who did you see his...  Oh, the Bronx Zoo.  Excuse me.  Oh, what?  In the bathroom?  Yeah, we both, like...  I don't know.  We were both at the urinal, and it was...  Oh, man.  Yeah, he likes to, like, I don't know, step back when he does his business.  Oh, the Superman pee?  Yeah.  Does he do it that way?  The hands on your hips?  I'll never forget that.  Mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper.  I think I was 10.  I'm like, oh, boy.  I'll take care of it.  Everybody in the room was having, I guess, the same procedure as he was having. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  And most of the people are older and very shy.  They have no...  People come around to see them or visit them.  They're lonely.  If he shows me his stuff, I look away, and they all got this smile on their face, like,  I'm next.  Why don't you come over and look at mine?  They're looking around the room, and they're all holding their sheets, like, yeah, I got  the same procedure done.  There's a sausage factor in the VA hospital.  That ain't right.  So then the nurse comes in, and he's like, I need some more tape. 
[01:30:00]  I need to tape the tube to my knee.  And he pulls the whole entire sheet off to show all of his stuff instead of a little bit  over his knee.  Oh, my God.  And I guess apparently he's been doing that all night to all the nurses.  Hence how they all knew him.  Oh, really?  I guess I'd be right to be proud, though.  Yeah.  He is a huge.  There you go.  Jesus Christ, man.  That is just wrong.  You don't want to see your dad's stuff.  Shaving and...  Oh.  I got to get to work.  All right, Brett. 
[01:30:30]  You guys have a great show.  Tell Gavin A.  All right, man.  Later, man.  There he goes, my brother.  God, that's...  That is just a...  He'll remember that now.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  That image will be stuck in his head.  That was so funny.  Sorry.  150 casualty.  Oh, boy.  Sharing the laughter and love, an Ovi and Anthony family special.  I'm Jerry Springer.  Let's go to Sam and Eric to see what's coming up after the break. 
[01:31:00]  Thanks, Jerry.  E-Rock, it's sharing the laughter and love.  And when we get back, we certainly do just that, as Anthony talks about his family.  Yeah, Anthony has to deal with the fact that his siblings have kids now.  When they all swore they'd never get married or ever have kids.  Well, darn, E-Rock, we all have to deal with changes.  At least we know that Anthony will still continue to date girls of the same age that he dated when he was in high school.  Perhaps one day, his niece can hook him up.  Darn tootin'.  Stay tuned.  Sharing the laughter and love continues. 
[01:31:30]  An Ovi and Anthony family special.  Sharing the laughter and love, an Ovi and Anthony family special.  Hi, folks.  I'm Jerry Springer.  And we're back with Sharing the Laughter and Love, an Ovi and Anthony family special. 
[01:32:00]  And over my career as a television host, I've talked to a lot of different families.  This particular family needs their own reality series.  You see, in this segment, Anthony's siblings join us with his sister Dawn and her little baby in studio and brother Joe on the phone.  Let's take a listen.  Wow, another big crowd outside the Sirius XM Satellite radio studio. 
[01:32:30]  Yes.  It's a very big day here on Satellite.  We do the rest of our show.  Ron and Fez have the big party show.  Saying goodbye to Lily today.  Yes.  She's going on to bigger and better things than just, you know, being a flunky for a second-rate radio show.  She's got a big opportunity.  Certainly does. 
[01:33:00]  It's a great opportunity.  Working with Brother Weez up there in Rochester, New York.  And for me, for all I care and everything like that, I'm just in it for the party.  Oh, I know.  You know.  I think we know that.  I'll be like, who's going where?  Get me another goddamn drink.  This is going to be a wild Ron and Fez show.  I think we're pretty much the warm-up show today.  I would think.  We're the warm-up show.  Everyone, I believe, is hanging out and going to have some fun there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, I was listening to their show yesterday, and apparently they had some germaphobe guy on. 
[01:33:30]  Some guy that's involved with their show that they're familiar with.  Right.  And they were taking the bathroom key and seeing if he would lick it.  And he was talking about how there's fecal matter all over it, and people urinate, use the key, and then they don't wash their hands.  They bring it back, which is true.  Which just goes to show you, I'm not that crazy, because I do touch the key.  Yeah.  But then they had people putting the key in their mouth and sucking on the bathroom key. 
[01:34:00]  Which then led me to think, now I won't touch the key, because it's been in people's mouths.  There's not so much, I don't care if someone takes a dump, misses with their wipe, and the key smells like duty.  I would throw the key in my mouth.  Would you?  Yeah, I think I would.  Would you?  And I'm not just saying that for the radio.  Thank you.  Probably not the smartest thing.  Well, you put baby diaper shit on your upper lip, so.  You know what? 
[01:34:30]  I feel like, in a way, you and I are related, because people are saying, baby diaper mustache with Dawn's kid.  I'm like, that's like, I feel like there's some kind of, it's too close now.  Baby diaper mustache with Dawn.  Well, now we're talking.  Period mustache.  Oh, God.  Period mustache with your sister.  Come on, who's with me?  You're getting in just under the wire, I think, as far as a period goes for her.  It'll be a dust mustache.  Obviously, she was able to have one, but I don't know.  Do you think she got it out just in time? 
[01:35:00]  Just in a nick of time, that one.  Do you want to discuss that with your sister?  I think that could be fun.  Little Dawn-y?  Yeah, Dawn-y and how the end is near.  Come on, she's not that old.  How is it?  Oh, my God.  She's 50.  No.  She's the young one, right?  She was the baby.  You're the middle child, obviously.  Yeah.  Middle child is just an attention-wanting, craving ass.  That's what I was my whole life.  Joe, my older brother Joe, was the firstborn older brother, so he was the one always kind 
[01:35:30]  of in trouble, more outgoing, things like that.  Dawn being the baby and the girl got spoiled rotten.  Just really spoiled brat.  Can we bring her in here for a minute or so?  Yeah, see if she's wandering.  She might be feeding a baby or something important like that.  I don't know.  And me, I was the middle kid who just wanted a little attention.  And I was always crying out for attention. 
[01:36:00]  Literally crying out for attention.  Sit down, Dawn, for a minute or two here.  Now, Ed, I snapped a picture of you and little Warren.  Yeah.  You were really happy holding the kid.  Really?  I captured some real happiness in your eyes.  I am such a great actor.  Nah, there's something that's blocking you for whatever reason.  But when it comes right down to it, you are all smiles.  You had a glisten in your eyes. 
[01:36:30]  And even little Warren.  He's adorable.  You even gave him a loving pat on his head.  There is nothing cuter than a little baby head.  Dawn, you make cute kids, man.  Thank you.  Unbelievable.  He's got a big giant head, though.  You know what you do?  You go to kiss the top of their head.  But then you go, you like suck in like a balloon animal thing to their soft spot.  And you make it go up and then you twist it into a little shape.  And then they have another little head on top of their head.  It's so cute.  No, it's kind of dented now. 
[01:37:00]  What?  You sort of see a little soft spot.  Just a little head.  Hey, Dawny, why aren't you damaged like Anthony?  Well, oh, what do you mean?  Like all bitter and have issues?  Yeah.  With the spaghetti hitting the wall.  And, you know, we've heard the stories on the show.  Yeah, we all went through it.  Everybody handles things differently.  I think Dawny was a little bit younger then, too.  Yeah.  Like, you know, and Joe was a little older, so he didn't care.  And I was more sensitive than both of you.  He's such a Jan Brady.  Oh, the middle child.  All the issues.  I'm the middle child.  And I'm going out with George Glass. 
[01:37:30]  But, yeah, middle child always just trying to get the attention that they never get.  Is it true that Anthony cried a lot growing up?  Or is he making that up?  Oh, my God, yeah.  You know what?  He had such an issue with being called Tony.  Yeah.  If the song would come on, the name game with Tony, Tony, Boboni, he would just start crying.  I would start crying in the car.  Yeah, in the car.  That song.  Yeah.  The name game, Tony, Tony, Boboni.  Because these two jackasses, my brother and sister, would point at me and go, Tony, Tony. 
[01:38:00]  And I'm like, I'm not Tony.  I'm Anthony.  Oh, no, that's a perfect reason for a child to just blubber and start crying his eyes out.  Because he doesn't like being called Tony.  I realized I was all screwed up.  I think you make a good point.  Because there's six, seven kids in my family.  And I really believe the last three had a lot easier.  Because I think the parents start getting tired. 
[01:38:30]  And whatever issues they do have, they're like, ah.  Yeah, we don't care.  We don't care as much.  Well, it's like, too, after Joseph and Anthony, I was like, no matter what I did, it was nowhere near the stuff that they did.  Yeah.  You know, so, yeah, by the time it came around to me, nobody really cared.  I wasn't getting thrown out of school or anything.  And we discussed the Kumiya family.  Like, the dynamics have drastically changed.  But you guys were all about not having kids from you, Anthony, and Joe.  And now two of you have gone down in the last few months.  Yeah.  Changing everything. 
[01:39:00]  Because Anthony was set on the air the other day.  He doesn't like hanging out with your mom or anybody.  Oh, it's all about the babies now.  Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.  It's baby, baby, baby.  Baby, baby, baby.  And then mom says, you know, hey, come on over.  So I go over.  And she goes, I promise.  We'll hang out.  We'll talk and stuff like that.  And she sits down to talk.  And then she's like, oh, the baby.  Oh, no.  I said I would talk to you.  And then it becomes.  It's like not.  It's not like she's hanging out talking.  It's like I will inconvenience myself by talking to you, Anthony.  And not do what I really want to do, which is dote over the children nonstop. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, she's out of control right now.  She's just insane.  Well, she is.  Look at Sal.  Thumbs up.  Yeah, Sal's thumbs up.  He's like, she's insane.  Yeah.  Sal's got his own problems with mom because she only talks about the babies.  That's why I'm here by myself.  Yeah.  Sal's here by himself.  Yeah.  Because mom doesn't care about anything else is what it is.  She doesn't want to know for anything else.  It's all about these babies now. 
[01:40:00]  That's it.  Sal, you're completely in the backseat now.  Oh, further.  I'm in the trunk.  But I see a happiness on your face as well.  She lets me out for air every once in a while.  Yeah.  Hi, Sal.  Sal's kind of happy about it because he doesn't have to deal with mom.  Maybe that's the secret, Dawn.  Huh?  Maybe that's the secret, what he said.  Yeah, don't have to deal with mom.  Yeah.  I hope she's not listening. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, I know.  Well, she's probably not.  She doesn't know how to turn on the radio.  She hasn't figured out how to put on that sound.  Yeah.  What do I do?  Where's the crank?  Somehow the DVR will wind up going on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't.  She goes like this.  She goes, oh, I don't know that remote control thing.  Like it's some newfangled device.  God.  Now, what would she be mad at?  That I tell her that she doesn't pay attention to anything but the babies now.  Mm-hmm.  She's just completely into her grandchildren, which, you know, I guess she waited long enough 
[01:41:00]  for them.  Yeah, I think she's a little annoyed that she had to wait as long as she had to wait.  I don't think she...  She didn't think this was ever going to happen.  No.  No.  Of course not.  We all wrote ourselves off.  Right.  I had conversations with all three of you, and you're like, kids, help.  Yeah, that ship sailed.  But now that you have one, now that you have one, obviously, you've changed your tone.  They are both.  My brother is a disgusting display of fatherly love.  Oh, yeah.  That is... 
[01:41:30]  It just makes me wretch when I say it.  Joe's an amazing daddy.  He is.  Yeah.  Good for Joe.  Good for Joe.  He used to be an amazing guitarist.  He still is.  Oh, that second fiddle now.  Oh, when I saw him leaning over the crib with his guitar, playing a little song, I was like,  oh, I remember him snorting coke off a horseback.  And there he is.  I think he plays the Winnie the Pooh song on his guitar for the baby.  Yeah.  Let's remind people of the trip to Rutland, Vermont, which we called Slutland. 
[01:42:00]  And, yeah, there were different babies in the room that day, weren't there?  Oh, yeah.  Oof.  Yeah.  Anthony, that's that middle child thing.  Anthony isn't, like, not getting the attention.  It's not.  Now, I brought this up.  It's not the fact that I'm not getting the attention.  Because I haven't changed here.  Everyone else changed.  And it's not about my attention.  It's about being able to hang out with Joe and Dawn.  Let's go to the bar.  Let's do this, whatever. 
[01:42:30]  And when they come over to Mom's house, we would all hang out around the table, drink, laugh.  And now it's just this baby, like, toys and garbages all over the place.  The discussions are about the baby.  How many fucking times did I have to listen to,  you should hear, Layla makes this screaming sound now.  All right, enough about this screaming sound.  Eee, wee.  Watch, I'll get her to do it.  Eee, eee, eee.  And I'm just like, what happened?  And what happened to Joe just playing some Blue Oyster cult lead? 
[01:43:00]  Oh, we discussed, you know, the color of what's in their diaper.  Oh, wonderful.  And how long did they pee enough today?  Oh, this spin-up just came out so projectile.  Yeah.  Now that's my brother and sister.  And the kids are close in age, right?  Yeah, two months.  Wow.  Layla was born May 15th, and Warren was born July 20th.  Warren Dean.  Warren Dean.  His name is Warren Dean.  Warren Dean.  Very serious guy.  He'll be indicted on charges in Watergate or something.  Doesn't that sound like a Watergate?  Great name.  I think it's actually like a financial broadcaster on some radio station in New York. 
[01:43:30]  I'm Warren Dean, and that's what's happening in finance.  Warren Dean Esquire.  Anthony, you've got to look at this differently, though, because eventually Warren is going  to be 14 bringing, you know, girls around for you.  All right.  And I could thank him two years earlier for bringing one for me.  No, I tease, of course.  And you have to be 61?  Oh, he's 63.  Hello.  Hey, well, Brother Joe's on 10, because he wants that. 
[01:44:00]  So now we've got the trifecta of comias.  Hey, you know something?  Change the tag.  I don't want him and known as Brother Joe anymore.  It's Father Joe.  Father Joe.  Now he's Father Joe, because I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened to Brother Joe.  I don't know what happened to my mic either.  Well, goddamn thing.  Yeah.  Father Joe.  All right.  Here he is.  Father Joe.  It's Father Joe now.  So what happened?  Joe grows up. 
[01:44:30]  Anthony freaks out.  Joe grows up in his 40s.  In his late 40s.  Wow.  Congrats.  Really late.  Don't you think I feel as though I've had enough of what you call fun?  I mean, it's fine, man.  I definitely, I enjoyed snorting coke off whores' backs.  Oh my God.  Here it is.  I had a perfect fucking, a perfect time growing up.  But you know what, man?  This is.  It's just, it's all about the, I was doing exactly what I'm doing now anyway. 
[01:45:00]  This is Jeff Goldblum's speech in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  No, we were wrong to resist.  We were wrong.  You are a rock star.  And I, and I, and, and it's, it's a beautiful thing that you can live like that.  But I'm not.  And it doesn't matter.  It is all about it.  But you used to be a rock star.  Why is he calling you a rock star?  I don't know.  He used to.  He is.  He still is.  Joe, Joe's.  I still travel the fucking world.  I love it.  It's, it's a lot of fun.  I have a great time doing it. 
[01:45:30]  But dude, you come home and you see the little girl.  That's it.  I'm done.  I'm done.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, what's that sound I'm hearing?  I'm hearing a baby crying.  Little Warren's crying.  That's it.  Oh, I thought, I thought Fez had joined our show for a second.  No, Joe, the thing is, it's not, it's, it has nothing to do with your lifestyle as far  as that, it has to do with what's important, me. 
[01:46:00]  When you, when, when you're hanging out at mom's, it's, there's no shit check on, it's  always baby stuff.  Like I told you, give it a couple more years, you'll be shitting your pants too, and then  she'll pay attention.  That's a good line.  Oh, what?  I didn't hear it.  The baby was crying.  Oh, that's a great sound, isn't it?  Oh, my God.  You know what, though, man?  You see one fucking smile, and it makes up for all crying. 
[01:46:30]  Yes, it does.  Aw, you know I can't smile without you.  You're making me sick.  I know, I know.  Just picture this.  Picture this.  You got a, you got a horrendous hangover.  Yeah.  One day, one day.  It's Saturday morning.  Well, why'd you talk, Father Joe?  Oh, why not?  Father Joe's talking.  Yeah, because it's all about the kid.  Go ahead.  One day you'll find the right girl.  You'll settle down.  I settle down every night, Ma.  What a different girl every night.  What are you talking about, Ma? 
[01:47:00]  I need the knife.  Can you imagine a horrendous hangover?  Yeah.  And crying baby.  And hearing crying baby?  No.  Oh, actually, wait a minute.  I do.  It's called coming into this show on a daily basis.  Now, try to figure out who the crying baby is.  I haven't had a horrendous hangover in a long time.  Yeah, me neither, Joseph.  And the baby stopped crying.  You feed the baby, the baby stopped crying.  That's all you have to do, Andy.  Oh, Dawn, put your tit back. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, my God.  Well, all right, let me.  Can you please breastfeed in front of all of us?  That would be so creepy in so many ways.  The baby's only using one.  Could I maybe use the other one?  No.  The baby cried for like a few seconds, and then you feed the kid, and he's done.  Yeah, he's good, see?  Dawn's got some pretty big tits right there.  Oh, my God.  Doesn't she?  They got large.  What about a crowd?  Anything?  Yeah, yeah.  Except an uncomfortable look?  I'll applaud Dawn's big tits.  Yeah.  I got bigger.  I think, right?  Jimmy can't look. 
[01:48:00]  That's what childbirth does.  They're big and full.  Look, Jimmy.  Look to your...  But we're not breastfeeding.  Jimmy's not looking because he's thinking, ask about her vag.  Oh, no.  Sal's here.  Oh, yeah.  Sal, yes, she does have big tits.  Sal's just a step on.  There's no blood there.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Uncle Paul.  Lock the front door.  You've got to see what those babies look like before they pump 42 ounces from each one. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, my goodness.  What do you have?  One of those breast pumps?  Huge.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I went out and bought the Cadillac of breast pumps.  Oh, you did, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, the good one.  But every once in a while, she'll get, like, she'll be on a...  Yeah, she'll take a drive up to New Hampshire.  She won't get a chance to pump.  So those fuckers blow up huge.  So, Joe, what do you think...  Yeah, go ahead.  Joe, what do you think Anthony's big issue is? 
[01:49:00]  Like, what do you think it is?  With having a baby, I think, honestly, what he saw was my...  Growing up...  Now, Ant, just give me a second before you say it fucking works.  I know you're going to jump all over this.  He saw the old man and what happened to his life trying to raise three kids at 20 fucking  four years old.  So I think that anything having to do with babies, with kids, I think it's a very deep-seated 
[01:49:30]  psychological thing, which is fine.  There's nothing wrong with it.  But I think that Dawn and I probably were able to overcome that and see that you can have...  That is some bullshit.  The only overcoming was yours going into an unprotected vagina.  Yeah, well...  That's overcoming.  You overcame.  That's absolutely true.  That's how it happens.  Yes, Anthony.  But Joe...  But you guys were all on the same page, like, feeling the same way about kids and raising a  family.  And then circumstances...  We never actually felt... 
[01:50:00]  We were never as adamant about...  I mean...  Oh, really unplanned?  I really didn't think that...  I really didn't think that it was going to happen.  But, you know, surprise, surprise, at 44, it happens.  And you just go, well, that's pretty cool.  I got to go with this.  And he's amazing.  Sometimes you look at that abandoned, dusty old house, and someone walks out the front  door, and you're like, I didn't think anyone was living in there.  There's still someone living in this old house.  Oh! 
[01:50:30]  Let's talk about your sister's vag for a while.  That's great.  Come on.  It was like a horse race.  Here it comes.  And baby is in the lead.  Baby's in the lead, but menopause is coming up quickly.  Menopause is coming up quickly, but baby is still ahead by the nose.  And menopause is...  Don't use that.  It's too loud.  You're going to bother the baby.  Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Jimmy's such a natural with the babies.  I like babies.  Yeah, of course he is.  Creep.  Because he looks like one.  Joe, you think basically that Anthony's allowing childhood stuff to kind of creep into his adulthood 
[01:51:00]  and affect the way he looks at babies?  Yeah, absolutely.  I think when he was a kid, he saw the old man freak out about having three kids.  I mean, really freak out.  The old man went off his fucking nut and blew a gasket.  He definitely blew a gasket.  He had to get as far away as possible.  He went to the other ocean.  An ocean stopped him.  He would have gone further if an ocean hadn't stopped him.  That's the crux of Anthony's problem with kids.  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Probably is.  You know, I don't like the memory of the spaghetti hitting the wall.  But I don't like how these guys are talking to you.  You all felt the same thing.  All right.  You're right, Opie.  Go fuck yourself.  But they're acting like they were able to overcome this.  We're different people, I guess.  It was just circumstances that got you two to where you are tonight, Dawn and Joe.  I think it's a different perspective on the issue, too.  You know, man, I started to realize it's not that huge a change in your life.  It really isn't, man.  Well, Joseph's the guy. 
[01:52:00]  Joseph's the guy.  It's easy for him to say.  More importantly, we've just plowed through 8,000, and Dow is now in the 7,000s.  Yeah.  We're down 689 points.  We're almost down 700, and the stock market's been open for seven minutes.  Dawn, if you have any trouble, I just want you to know.  I know financially times are tough, and you know that if you need any money, white babies  go for so much.  We're not selling them.  You're not selling the kid?  No, we're not selling them.  Oh, come on.  On the open market? 
[01:52:30]  He'd get a lot.  He's gorgeous.  Cute white kid.  You could just have another.  Oh, boy.  What's going on?  Have another?  Uh-uh.  I thought she was going to whip out a tit.  I swear to God.  Oh, yeah.  No.  He's trying to relax.  I hope he's ready to go.  That would rock.  It kind of would.  Because it would just be creepy on so many levels.  The boy doesn't like all the ruckus.  The boy's trying to relax.  I don't like being on the radio.  You know what I mean?  That's how to soothe the baby.  He's just got to be calm.  Kids relaxing.  Yeah.  All right.  We're over 8,000 now, Ann. 
[01:53:00]  So we're back.  Yeah, that's scary.  That scared people right there.  They're sipping into 7,000.  By the way, breaking news.  It said breaking news on MSNBC.  You know how they do their breaking news thing?  Yeah.  End of capitalism?  Question mark?  That was the breaking news today.  We're going commie?  Nice.  Socialism.  Good evening.  You thought Obama was going to do the socialism thing.  Well, the one thing, this crash is bringing the price of gas down.  Yeah.  The price of oil is down into the 80s barrel, which is nice. 
[01:53:30]  And, well, okay.  I guess you could take a seat in a more comfy spot with your little baby.  My little nephew.  Your little nephew.  There is a happiness in Anthony's eyes.  He just doesn't want to really, you know.  I'm very happy for my brother and sister and everybody that was involved in the fucking  process to get the children.  Everybody involved in the process.  Thank you, Patrick.  Yes, Patrick.  Good job fucking my sister, Patrick.  Jesus.  You really laid that pipe down. 
[01:54:00]  Nice.  Oh, my God.  You're making me very uncomfortable.  Yes.  Which is really hard to do.  I'm almost honored.  I'm kind of with you, too, there today, Jimmy.  I'm sitting here with a full rod.  Hey, Dawn, you lactating?  Dawn, comment.  Dawn, are you lactating at all?  No?  No, the lactating is done?  No, the baby rejected me from the get-go.  So, in the hospital, we probably had about nine lactation consultants that came in.  There's a lactation consultant?  What do they do? 
[01:54:30]  They take the baby.  The baby's crying.  They shove his mouth.  They taste your milk to see what's wrong with it.  Let me get a little shot of that.  Yeah, the baby would not cooperate.  Would not latch down.  He kind of put his mouth around and go, ah, ah.  That happens.  The kid will reject it sometimes.  Oh, boy.  You better get him liking those things real quick.  No, he takes the formula in the bottle.  He starts smiling when Clay Aiken's phone for Clay.  Yeah, you know, I bet.  I got an expiration milk joke that I'm holding back on.  Oh, I'm holding back, though. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  Maybe if your milk didn't have a picture of Adam Walsh missing on the side of it.  Oh.  Why, Ant?  That's an old joke.  I did get to use the pump in the hospital and try that whole thing.  I got to go.  Love you guys.  All right, Father Joe.  No, Father Joe now.  Father Joe.  No longer Brother Joe.  Sharing the life and love.  And Opie and Anthony family special.  I'm Jerry Springer.  Let's go to Sam and Eric to see what's coming up after the break. 
[01:55:30]  Why, thanks, Jerry.  Sam and E-Rock here.  Sam, after the break, again dealing with Anthony's family, his stepfather Sal is in studio.  We've heard the Sal impressions from day one, and everybody has always wanted to meet the great Sal.  I think this day he won line of the day.  And he certainly did.  And he watched feces porn.  Stay tuned for Sharing the Laughter and Love, an Opie and Anthony family special.  Terrific.  Sharing the Laughter and Love, an Opie and Anthony family special, continues after these messages. 
[01:56:00]  Welcome back to Sharing the Laughter and Love, an Opie and Anthony family special.  We're back with Sharing the Laughter and Love, an Opie and Anthony family special.  I'm Jerry Springer.  In this next segment, Anthony's stepfather Sal is in studio to talk about his relationship with Anthony's mother.  Who could resist that sexy accent of his? 
[01:56:30]  People really want more Sal.  Sal, any comment about what we just were talking about with the kids and Anthony, and why Anthony might not want to be a father?  I just can say I have a lonely life now.  I see the family once in a while.  Yeah.  How long have you been retired now?  Nine years.  Eight years.  Yeah, nine years.  And it's him and mom just muttering around the house.  And now that the kids are here. 
[01:57:00]  You should have been there yesterday.  There was no muttering.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Was he yelling?  Did you get in trouble yesterday?  No, I'm always in trouble.  How is it that you're 70 and you still get in trouble from a woman?  What is it that men have to like, they have their mommies at first that just yell at them all the time, tell them what to do.  And then the second they're free, you wind up getting in some shit where you got to get yelled at still.  You're 70.  Why is a woman yelling at you?  It's your mother that's doing it. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  What did you do wrong, Sal?  Everything.  What's the matter?  There isn't anything I do right.  It's everything, Sal.  I'll be killed when I get home if she learns how to turn that on.  Here's the trick.  Here's the trick, Sal.  It was all for radio.  Yeah.  It was just a bit.  It was for the radio.  Just say that and everything will be fine.  Get him to tell why he's in trouble.  It's all for the radio.  But, Sal, why are you in trouble?  Yeah, I want to know specifically.  I don't know that.  There's no answer to that why I'm in trouble.  What do you expect me to have an answer?  She'll just go, oh, Sal, you're an idiot. 
[01:58:00]  That's what she'll say.  Did you leave your socks around?  No, nothing.  I was perfect.  I was fine.  Yeah.  Sal will do like, my mother will go like,  I want to redecorate.  I want to retile the floor or something.  And then, you know, Sal will dish it out.  And then you just got to take shit.  Yes.  Yes.  That's called marriage when you're old.  But now, one interesting thing that comes up.  Sal will always mention when girls come on to him. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  In front of mom, he'll mention those.  What happened when you were out with the caddy?  Well, I went up the street to go to stop and shop.  I had to top down my beautiful car.  And I get out and this blonde comes walking towards me.  And she's really young and very pretty.  She said to me, what kind of car is that?  I said, it's a Cadillac.  She says, I didn't know Cadillac made a car like that.  I said, yeah.  She walks up, puts her face right in front of mine.  And she says, I'd do anything to take a ride in that. 
[01:59:00]  And then I went immediately home and told my wife, because if somebody saw me, I would  have been dead.  Is he having anything?  Could you?  Now, now that I'm trying to, I'm just trying to figure out what that was about.  What was she?  Okay.  Wait, was she a prostitute?  No, no.  I think she was going in stop and shop.  I was going in to get Viagra or something.  And you, like if you said, hey, you want to go for a ride, she absolutely would have 
[01:59:30]  hopped in?  I think so.  She was very serious.  At least I think so.  How old was she?  About 25.  Holy shit.  Nice.  Sal, you're insane.  Look, I love my mother and stuff.  But if some girl like that comes up to you, you got to at least, you know, get a little  taste.  That's why I came up here.  I was hoping.  Let her enjoy the ride in the Cadillac with her head in your lap.  I think Sal might be leaving a part out.  Like she probably said, I'd do anything for a ride in that. 
[02:00:00]  And he said, really?  Anything?  And she went, it's a figure of speech.  And then she walked away laughing.  Well, why don't we get Dawn to give him a lap dance or something?  Jesus!  Even I don't go that far.  Isn't that partially incense or something?  Incense.  Incense.  All right.  Sal Voss is on the show today.  Oh, very good.  That's fantastic.  One of these days, I guess Joe will come in with the little Layla.  We'll do family day. 
[02:00:30]  Why would the mic work?  Try that again.  Oh, we'll do family day.  Yeah, family day.  That'll be good.  And I could watch you guys talk about babies and stuff while I just sit like a lump of  shit.  It'll be great.  Do I have to bring Ro?  No, you can leave Ro.  Mom never wants to go anywhere.  She does.  She wants to go to my house and she wants to go and see the grandkids is all.  And no matter how many times I say you have an open invitation to come over to my house,  I kind of, you know, always get the, no, I want to be invited. 
[02:01:00]  I think, well, especially in the afternoon.  It's like, you know, that's easy.  Parents should just show up.  I told you about that.  At night, that might be weird.  She must ask Ro.  Otherwise, she doesn't show up.  She needs to be asked.  Yeah, she's a polite person.  I know she is, but she's mommy.  She can come over whenever she wants.  She doesn't want to walk in and know your debauchery shop.  I was just going to tell you that.  She's going to knock on my bedroom door.  I have to hide a girl in a closet.  Yes.  Mom will burn all of her stuff.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Hey, Sal, you miss Jill?  Sal does. 
[02:01:30]  Sal does.  Yes, he does.  Sal does.  Sal was more in love than anybody.  I'll tell you that much.  I'd like to watch.  At my age, that's all you can do.  You were making out a lot in the beginning, right?  Right in front of you?  Yes.  You kind of miss her, don't you?  Yeah, a little bit.  She was nice to me.  Yeah, Sal was a little smitten.  But you understand Ann's point, right?  Oh, yeah, I understand.  It's like last night I called him because I thought,  gee, I'll leave my car at his house and ride in with him. 
[02:02:00]  I don't think so.  I was like, I have company.  Wait, so you couldn't have Sal over?  Yeah, why?  I had company over.  Well, kids are always over there, though.  Would you have friends?  Yeah.  Yeah, friends are over.  So I couldn't Sal come over and hand you a friend?  Why don't you let Sal get into the jersey?  I heard a lot of laughing and grunting, so I don't know.  It was getting a little late.  That's all.  And Anthony's a responsible broadcaster.  I have to get up for work, so it was time for me to go to bed and have sex.  No, I was coming over in the morning and leave my car, not last night. 
[02:02:30]  Oh.  And then ride in and then go back to your house.  Oh, that would have been fine.  Oh, okay.  It's a little late, but go ahead.  Of course it is.  I got lost.  I had to pee four times coming.  I had to stop on the expressway.  I stopped at Howard Johnson's or whatever.  I just got, and then finally downstairs in the garage, they wouldn't let me pee, and I  had to pee.  So I gave him 10 bucks.  I said, I'm going to pee on your lot here.  Yeah.  And I did. 
[02:03:00]  And you did?  Absolutely.  He said absolutely.  It cost me 10 bucks for that pee.  Sal, you rule.  That's right.  Jim's paid more than that for this.  Oh, God.  I've got as high as $3.50.  $3.50?  Yeah.  When you become 70, you got to do more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Sal, so you're hoping for something from us today, right?  Something.  Have you ever seen Two Girls, One Cup?  Oh, Sal.  Have you ever seen Two Girls, One Cup?  I saw three on a couch. 
[02:03:30]  No, that's right.  Sal, Tim.  A long time ago.  A while ago, Sal watched The Lesbian Couch.  The big Russian girl you had there?  Yeah.  What was this?  How long ago?  Oh, long time ago.  It was at N.E.W. on the couch, on the lesbian couch.  Sal was there one day.  There was a lot of hijinks.  And my friend was playing Pocket Pool?  Yeah, your friend had his hands in his pocket, and I'm like, what the hell's he doing?  Well, getting a little...  What you should be doing.  He's older than me.  Oh, that's why.  I mean, you know, that's...  This video, of course, the internet. 
[02:04:00]  Now, I know you're not very familiar with computers and stuff,  especially because of mom.  She doesn't want to...  But this is the internet, and there are a lot of videos on it.  You can get a lot of things.  There's one video in particular called Two Girls, One Cup.  It's sort of a love story between two girls.  So, if we could get that video up.  It's a steaming hot video, Sal.  I mean, they're very steamy, very hot.  This is not just hot, it's steaming hot. 
[02:04:30]  Is the bathroom near here?  Well, yeah.  Closer than you think.  This video, we show this video to everybody that comes in.  It's sort of like a...  It's only special people like this show.  It's sort of like a welcome.  Anybody over 70.  No, it's an initiation to anybody.  Initiation.  This can be enjoyed for children of all ages.  Let little Warren Dean show a watch.  Sal, so we want you to comment on what you see there for everybody. 
[02:05:00]  Two Girls Radio.  This is just for you.  Two Girls, One Cup.  Here we go.  Here we go.  For Sal.  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  All right.  I don't even like the title.  Now they kiss.  See, look at that.  Nice, right?  That's cute.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  Oh, come on.  I know it's hot.  Give me a break.  What do you think, Sal? 
[02:05:30]  You show this to your mother, you'd be dead.  I'm not even going to tell your mother I saw this.  I'll be dead.  Oh, look.  They're just kissing.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, now look.  Look, you know.  That, a little topping.  Yeah.  What do you think, Sal?  They must have chapped lips.  They got to put that stuff on their lips.  What the fuck?  And a little vomiting in the mouth.  Is this a long time? 
[02:06:00]  Oh.  Is this a long time?  Like, he wants it to be over.  It's a horror movie.  And there they are just with a big load of...  I think it's great.  Oh, wow.  We should all give it a big hand.  All right.  It's on the Opie and Anthony show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  He said, that's class.  That's class.  That's my Maryland talk.  Yeah.  And I could go home, you know.  You've been in New York, though, for how many years?  35?  And you still have a baldy more accent. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, but you've seen my brother.  You should hear him.  I mean, he sounds like he's from Georgia when I go down.  How does he talk?  How y'all doing?  He calls me Bud.  How you doing, Bud?  Bud?  Bud?  But you're Sal.  Yeah, it's Sal.  You don't know how to say that.  It's too many letters.  Holy crap.  He's great.  Sal, you rule.  You rule.  So, we want to play that again?  Yeah, you want to see it again? 
[02:07:00]  No.  Of course not.  Well, we can show you other stuff.  I mean, yeah.  We got plenty.  I'm really glad I came now.  The highlight of my day.  The internet is full of stuff like that.  If you were able to have a computer at the house, you could watch stuff like that day  and night.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be great?  I don't even know how to work my cell phone.  I'm not going to get a computer.  I know you don't because there's so many times I answer my phone and hear you and Mom  with Mom just yelling at you in the background.  Oh, Sal, you don't know which way you're going.  When are you driving too fast?  I'm like, okay. 
[02:07:30]  They sat on the phone.  Oh, really?  Like, I'm probably first.  The A.  You know, so he probably hit one.  And I've heard so many conversations of yours.  I just found out in my car, I press a button at the telephone and I tell her what number  I want and they give it to me.  Oh, yeah.  I used it today.  OnStar thing?  Yeah, the OnStar, but there's also a phone there.  I can do OnStar and a phone.  Press the button.  I say, dial.  And she says, dial all the numbers, including the area code.  And I say, bit, bit, bit, bit, bit, bit. 
[02:08:00]  And they give me whoever I want.  I spoke to Patrick because I was lost.  How did you ever get lost?  Did you ever see that movie Lost in Manhattan?  No.  It's coming to theaters soon.  Is it out right now?  No, it's coming soon.  Yeah, how do you get lost in Manhattan when it's like...  I drove by the place, I went down another street and I was lost.  But it's a grid of numbers.  Yeah, I know.  That's why I don't have a computer.  It's all these numbers. 
[02:08:30]  And doesn't your caddy have a nav system?  Yes.  I don't know how to work that either.  There's a market out there for...  Oh, Sal.  To make this stuff more easier for older people.  I went out to buy cigarettes.  Uh-oh.  And I had to punch the thing in to get home.  And it was taking me in the opposite direction.  It was sending me east instead of west.  I'm going, what the hell is this?  I punch it, punch it again.  Puka-taka, whatever it is.  And I didn't know how to find it. 
[02:09:00]  It's terrible.  He's going to Indian reservations for his cigarettes?  Yeah.  Man, you are bored.  You're bored at all.  You're going to the Mastic Indian reservation to buy your cigarettes.  $41 a case.  A case?  Nice.  $41.50 a case.  That's a carton, right?  A box.  A carton, yeah.  A carton.  See, that's another reason I don't have a computer.  I don't know how to spell.  Case, carton, whatever.  But it's a lot cheaper?  Oh, yeah.  Are they regular cigarettes?  No, no. 
[02:09:30]  I get what I, what I, they have every cigarette in the world.  They do?  Like, you say you want to buy Marlboro, you buy them for that cheap?  Yeah, well, you, I think Marlboro, they had on sale for $25 a carton.  Wow.  But I smoke Carleton's.  They're $41.50.  I think that's once you walk in the door, they go, okay, look at the car.  We charge you $41.50.  Oh, they see the Cadillac.  They charge you a little more.  It's a nice ride out there, except my computer doesn't know how to get me there.  You know, you could get turn-by-turn directions on that phone thing. 
[02:10:00]  On OnStar, you hit it, and then you tell them where you want to go.  They'll look it up for you, and then they give you turn-by-turn and say, you know, now  make a left, make a right.  Do they charge me extra for that?  No, it's just, you know, whatever you pay for OnStar.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's good stuff.  And then if you get bored, you just hit OnStar, and you could chat.  Yeah, they could chat.  They love that.  They could tell me how to fix my car, or give me some guy from GM.  Sometimes my OnStar, my phone, and my Escalator ring, and I answer it, and the other day it 
[02:10:30]  was some woman.  She goes, is Mike there?  And I go, hold on, I'll look.  And then obviously no one's in my car at that point.  And I started talking to her like I knew her, and said that her husband owed me money  for cocaine, and I got lucky.  I was like, you know Bob.  She goes, how do you know Bob?  I go, oh, I've known Bob for a while.  And she's like, that's my husband. 
[02:11:00]  I go, yeah, he owes me money for coke.  And she was, I just kind of left him hanging there.  Poor Bob, when he got home.  I hope she was a cop, but she dialed the wrong number, and now she's got your number.  We got a coke dealer.  And you're thrown in prison.  And raped.  Yeah, yes, yes.  He talks about these computers and stuff.  I don't even know the phone number of my phone in the car.  See?  I've only had it two and a half years.  Why should I know?  Why should you?  How often do you call your car?  Well, if I could give it to mommy, and she could call me. 
[02:11:30]  Sal, we've got to go to the Indian reservation.  Okay, kid.  Sal in Knight Rider.  My senses are detecting you have to pee again.  You're right, kid.  Where do I go?  I carried my little bottle, which I had to use.  Now, I'm going to put the little bottle out in the seat.  Thank you, kid. 
[02:12:00]  I have to pee again.  Jesus Christ, Sal.  We haven't gone a mile.  Don't argue with me, car.  You sound like Rue.  That's pretty close.  My phone's probably ringing in home.  People calling her and saying, do you know what your husband's saying?  I'll take Sal and scratch his ass.  You got an extra bedroom?  They're pretty much taken up at this point.  The hotel kumia.  I'm going to start putting those key cards. 
[02:12:30]  Cribs?  I want to get hotel locks put on there and give cards out so you can just slide them through.  You really should.  All right, you're upstairs.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, you've been upgraded to one of the suites.  To my suite.  You're in the room with the little bear on it.  You're in the room with the balloon on it.  We've got to get Sal to say Christmas shoes.  I mean, that's the big...  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's one of your favorite songs.  You like the Christmas shoes? 
[02:13:00]  You want me to cry, right?  Yeah, Sal cries at that song.  I cry at everything.  You like that song?  Every time I go home, I cry.  What do you like about Christmas shoes?  Yeah.  What is the story of Christmas shoes?  This little boy has $7.92.  And the shoes, they cost $7.95.  So he's got to buy these shoes for his mother because she's dying, I think.  So he don't have money.  So this little guy, this other man behind him, when he's trying to pay,  he gives the money, the extra money, and he takes his... 
[02:13:30]  Mommy will get her new shoes.  Mommy will be so happy.  It was a nice story.  And then she drops dead.  Yeah.  They go to the home and she's dead already.  She don't get the shoes.  What part makes you cry, though?  Just the whole story.  The whole story?  The whole story.  It's very nice little...  Did the kids save the receipt at least and bring the shoes back?  The guy behind him took the receipt. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, the guy...  Yeah.  Lend him the money and took all the money.  And the boy's address.  You're going to have to take some pictures for that $0.03.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I think the guy behind the counter wouldn't make such a big fuss over $0.03.  Give you a sore Christmas bottom.  Oh, so Sal could hear the...  Oh, the headphones.  The song.  Here's your song, Sal.  It's Christmas shoes, right?  Here it is.  Here it is. 
[02:14:30]  Uh-oh.  Looks like he wants to sing the song.  He's telling his daughter that Mommy's going to die.  That's the Christmas gift.  What, a dead mommy?  Yeah, a pine box under the tree.  That's...  Oh, Sal's got a tear in his life.  Sal's crying.  I told you. 
[02:15:00]  It's like Pavlov's retard.  Oh, Sal's crying.  That's not nice.  Oh, Sal.  Come on, we're waiting to Manhattan to cry.  Sal is a very sensitive man.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  It is sad, though.  I mean, it's Christmas, and he wants to just get her the shoes.  Yeah, now the kid's going to grow up with no mommy.  That's got to suck.  Yeah.  They move the holiday up.  It's Christmas?  Oh, sure.  In the song.  It's Christmas somewhere.  Yeah.  Mommy needs a satin hat, apparently. 
[02:15:30]  Mommy needs rouge on her cheeks.  Oh, no.  Look, it's Christmas formaldehyde.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Aw.  Sal's having a moment over there.  How come you're not crying?  Well, because he doesn't have any emotions in his body.  I'm like a Vulcan now.  Yeah.  It's not that sad.  For my mama.  Yeah, that's just sad.  You ever hear this song?  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  We've all heard it.  Thanks.  I was going to put this on his ear so he could cry.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Daddy says there's not much time.  That's right.  Take it to the fucking hospital.  We've got to get to the part where the mom dies.  Take it to the hospital, you fucking slouch.  Yeah, stop singing and call 911.  He's trying to get an insurance policy written real quick.  Christmas insurance policy.  Oh, it's a good part. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, it is.  It's no pendulum.  the pendulum swings the other way oh here it is the kid for my mama please  yeah she's gone

[02:31:00]  mom was just known for  that she worked all the  time so she was like  you know always doing  trying to do extra  things to like help you  out socially she  packed my sister's  lunch and uh my  sister comes home  crying from school she  was sent home she  went to catholic  school my mom had  packed her lunch and  you know how you would  wrap up um sodas and  tinfoil yeah wrapped up  a can of beer by  accident my sister got  sent home from school  rock yeah that's a  cool mom like peanut  butter and jelly and  bud i never had i never 
[02:31:30]  had the cool lunch no i  was i was always the guy  trying to upgrade my  lunch with my pals  really oh yeah i never  wanted to do that because  i was skeeved out by  anyone else's like mom's  hands touching the food  they know if you want to  trade this sandwich i'm  like oh you're skeevy  mom's hands all over this  thing i get i get like a  you know a bruised apple  for uh for snack and my  buds would have like  homemade chocolate chip  cookies or homemade  brownies i'm like come  on man trade and i never  i know the horror you went 
[02:32:00]  through with the school  lunch dude but especially  with the bag i never  wanted the brown bag i  never wanted the little  brown bag i wanted a  lunch box and every year  damn it i got a lunch  box i had my uh lost in  space lunch box you know  one of my brothers should  call up with the thermos but  i remember because you're  hitting a a real soft spot  in my family you should  just hear what opie had to  go to school with for his  lunch the bags we were so 
[02:32:30]  poor i'll tell you the  story yeah like anthony said  everyone think how  embarrassing this is it's  the big king i'll tell the  story you ass if my brother  calls that's great how  embarrassing he would be  suicidal to tell the story  on the air but basically  like anthony said you know  all your friends had the  cool lunch boxes maybe like  uh i don't know the brady  bunch you know lunch box or 
[02:33:00]  the scooby-doo lunch box  yeah open it up you got your  little thermos in there for  your little fruit cup or  something right and uh your  drink and your sandwich all  nice and wrapped sure and  and then if you didn't have  lunch box or you didn't  want one uh you could go to  the store and buy the little  lunch bag no no i'll explain  the lunch box were you know  were given to the kids whose  moms really cared right then  you had the kids that came in  like you said with the small  brown lunch bag you could go  to this uh store and buy a big  stack of those right oh no it 
[02:33:30]  cost too much money to get the  small brown paper bags for my  lunch see we were so poor like  rick rick guest about two  minutes ago my god damn lunch a  lousy peanut butter and jelly  sandwich and a bruised apple  were that's it it was just like  two little things where we're in  a huge huge wall bounds paper 
[02:34:00]  bag the one they pack the  groceries in and then what was  what was your uh what was your  carrying style would you carry the  whole thing or roll it and so it's  just like the big bottom of the  bag and this huge rolled up it gets  worse it gets worse we brought the  bags home home after lunch you had  to fold them up and bring them home  oh that's pretty bad man so we could 
[02:34:30]  put uh uh the book covers on our  textbooks you made them out of the  out of the paper bags yeah so like my  science textbook had a big huge wall  bounds on the front while my friends  had the cool star trek book covers so  they were dual purpose anthony they were  used to to carry my lousy sandwich and  bruised apple to school and then we  had to bring them home so we can make 
[02:35:00]  book covers  did it have your name written on it too  oh bait  because then when you leave that with  your coat over you know you have your  whole thing set up  yeah everybody knows it's your bag if  your name's on it  oh the big shopping bag  i knew my brother would call  he's a bitter man  elmo hey what's up man is this a  nightmare or what why are you bringing  this up 
[02:35:30]  you know it gets dark at four o'clock i'm already  suicidal and you have to bring that up  i mean we would take these huge like king  calling bags and roll the top down and  fold them and do whatever we could to try to mimic those small little bags we looked  normal but once i also got a cement bag from dad  wait a minute  one of those huge cement bags we you know we were done uh doing the uh sidewalks around the house  like like a sacrete bag or something 
[02:36:00]  yeah one of those huge bags and you know because my dad  still had powder in it  so we put put the food in that and rolled it up i'm like you gotta be kidding me  trust me my brother says it it happened it happened i'm dying for you a cement bag  this is like the shame of our family  i still can't go shopping and get a get paper i always have to go plastic just to erase the memory 
[02:36:30]  elmo you notice how like it's telling all his horror stories from growing up and i'm keeping my mouth shut  i know i'm like oh my god that's like going to a spa  i'm like i'm just biting my lip because i don't want to have a nervous breakdown live on the air  come on unload it'll make you feel better tell uh anthony about the uh the sugar and margarine  sandwiches at grandma's house oh a delicacy  what are they feeding the kids  i'm diabetic now i wonder why 
[02:37:00]  oh my god  he is too  what what what did they do  well my grandma had a beach house out there in waiting river  and uh that sounds pretty fancy  no it was  it sounds it  it sounds it was a nice it was great it was a great little house  and uh i don't know um she had about  what 40 grandkids elms  at least  so she would just break out a you know a loaf of wonder bread  just on the table  quick margarine  all the way down she'd bake like 20 sandwiches at a time 
[02:37:30]  and then just pour sugar on on the on the on the  and give it to kids  and give it to us  and give it to kids  yeah  like they weren't wired enough  and then we'd just bounce around  bing bing bing  and then we'd go outside to get fried by the sun  because we didn't uh  we didn't wear uh sunscreen  wait a minute they wouldn't put sunscreen on you  oh elm tell the whole story man  kids on crank getting burnt  yeah  well everything you say  all right number one  we'd go swimming in the ocean without any kind of supervision  when we're like three  we'd have no suntan motion 
[02:38:00]  we'd be eating sugar  i mean it was just  and then we would be so burnt from the sun that we couldn't move right  right  and uh what did we have to sleep in at night  the army blankets with the sand  it was like reclining on sandpaper  those old like army blankets the real rough ones  yeah those dark green blankets  and we used to make tents out of them  and we're talking we were so sunburned like our eyelids were red 
[02:38:30]  and like like our underarms were red  and we'd have to sleep on top of sand  and then we'd have to sleep um  in these army cots with an army blanket  we might as well have been sleeping  you know  uh on insulation  because it was the same feeling between the army blanket and the sand  that happened to be there from  the last person that slept in the army cup  and if it wasn't sand then it was full of sugar  which has the same effect  oh my god that's some upbringing 
[02:39:00]  it was great yeah  it was great  all i wanted was like the lousy little brown lunch  lunch bag  bag  little sandwich  i know i'd practically have to like stick people up  not not for the lunch money but for their lunch bag  like give me the bag  the last thing you wanted to do going to school was look different  i swear to god you just wanted a conform fit in so no one would give you crap  because the second you try to do something different  you're marked an outcast 
[02:39:30]  and if you're the big lunch bag guy  people calling you the big lunch bag guy  the cement lunch bag guy is even worse  that's the truth  but in the winter like i wouldn't wear my jacket  because i'd use it to camouflage the huge lunch bag  so now i go home with a cold  it's just  it's a nightmare  it was uh it was interesting  all i wanted was a sandwich  remember the kid in school in the cafeteria  that might as well have been the drug dealer 
[02:40:00]  he came in with the little plastic baggie of chocolate  for the chocolate milk  it was like this powder stuff  and everyone would gather around  man put a little in my milk man  put a little in  well what you got man  what do you have for me  i'm the chocolate man  here we go kids  i got chocolate  and like his buddies would all you know  just i i keep a little for my head  yeah  and then i get rid of the rest  yeah  oh my god  the chocolate milk kid like rule  i remember  i never got the chocolate milk 
[02:40:30]  you're kidding me  i remember that  and he would like dole it out to his buddies  so that the milk just  it was still like the color of milk  just vaguely brown  like yeah we're drinking chocolate milk  and you suck  wow i do suck  i tried to trade the uh bruised apple  or the bruised pear for that  but it never worked for some reason  no  i mean  why were fruit was a very low uh commodity  elms  on the ladder  elms when we were growing up  why were our apples so damn bruised  cause they had so much room to bounce around 
[02:41:00]  in those huge lunch bags  alright elms  alright i'm gonna go flip my wrist now  sharing the laughs and love  an opie and anthony family special  hello friends  jerry springer with you  i'm gonna hand it off now to sam and eric  to tell you what's coming up after the break  hey thanks jerry  sam and eric here with you  sam  coming up after the break  once again  opie anthony and jim  decide to share some stories of their childhood  well  anthony as it turns out

[02:42:30]  oh and his story  you know what else i learned yesterday  and i might be behind on this one  baseball cards  i i i collected them growing up  me too gregory  you did right  i loved them  need them got them need them  well my favorite player of all time was here yesterday  fucking very upset  did you hear what major league baseball did to the baseball companies  uh baseball card companies  what these  like tops  like this this is this this company needs more money  you know they only licensed one company to make uh major league baseball cards 
[02:43:00]  a year  well i don't know which company to be honest  tops or donruss or upper deck  i'm not sure which one got the upper decker  i'm not sure which one got the the contract  here is the weird thing  the rest of the companies still made baseball cards  but major league baseball made them blur out the logos on every fucking card  no way  remember when we were growing up you could buy different yeah different companies  and it was you know  it was only tops  huh  when i was growing up  if you didn't have tops baseball cards  they weren't fucking baseball cards  it went from tops and then it just got out of control 
[02:43:30]  then it got out of hand  then there were like five six companies at least  well now there's only one company officially allowed to make the baseball cards  using the major league baseball logos  i did not know that  wow that is something  do we have a picture of a baseball card where they have to blur out everything  i mean they have to blur out all the logos  the logos on the baseball player  the logos in the stadium  everything  it's almost a waste of time  so these these companies are basically going bankrupt  because they you know who wants to buy  who wants to buy baseball cards that don't have the logo of the baseball players 
[02:44:00]  i wonder if they did that because baseball cards became such an immediate big business  like they would have the special series  and every year they would sell like 50 dollar baseball  it became like this fucking they were just gutting people for money  wow  yeah  is that unbelievable i didn't know that  i i read that over the weekend  it's like you gotta be kidding me  i haven't bought baseball cards  get your mark mcguire rookie card  when he played with the  right  i don't even know what teams they're on 
[02:44:30]  don't know what teams are on  here's the upper decker  derrick jeter with the  newton  because if you say the team  you're gonna get  you're gonna get in trouble  i'm gonna get sued and screwed here people  sued and screwed  sued and screwed  unbelievable right  that's sad  yeah the deal hasn't started yet  it starts next year  so  next year  next year  get him while you can people  get him while you can  i cried a lot uh 
[02:45:00]  over my baseball cards growing up  i brought a don  larson  look this one up sam  oh  the year  after he pitched the perfect game  i brought that baseball card  into show and tell  oh i remember this  oh no  tragic  and this angry kid  i couldn't have been more than  i had to be in grammar school man  i think i was 10 or 11  and the kid  i was all proud  because i had one of the coolest things  at that show and tell that day  and this kid  he already had long hair  and he was miserable at 10  had a beard  yeah  he's 10 or 11 
[02:45:30]  and he's already miserable  i'm like how are you miserable at 11  and he  he reaches over  grabs my card  and  and not in pencil  takes a pen  and just  across my  hold on larson's card  in front of everybody  and man did i cry  like a little fucking bitch  was everyone laughing at you  they were  they all laugh at you  i think they were sad for me  because  why do you do that  huh  what a dick  he was just a fucking angry little fuck  dickheads  i would love to know what happened to this kid  i guaranteed  he's probably in prison  he killed don larson  right  don larson was fingering his eye 
[02:46:00]  and he couldn't take anymore  every time he saw don larson  he went bad shit  he just lost his mind  that guy  stand with a pen  like fucking peshy  uh  he pitched a perfect game  you think i  ran ice team  is that the one  yeah it's a year after  wow  you had that card  and he fucking drew on it  wait it might be the one  what a cock  i always thought it was  the year after  wait do the other card  go back into the image section  uh oh  i think it might be the other one 
[02:46:30]  that you showed  do you have a lame  fucking don larson card  i guarantee it's worth  less than fucking a hundred bucks  i think that one's gotta be  it's probably some like  player that sounded like him  it's sonny larson  with some other player  there's don larson  all right  don larson  yeah so it's like  40 50 bucks  that's it  50 bucks  you know what  worthless card  righteous  but you know what  a fine listener  felt sorry for me  and i don't even know his name  it just showed up  one day in the mail 
[02:47:00]  yeah  a brand new  fucking don larson card  maybe it was the guy  can you imagine  if it was the guy  he felt so guilty  all these years  finally went to a  12 step program  figured out it was you  on the radio  and was like  that's the guy  the don larson card guy  i cried like a  mother  fucking bitch  that day  it was bad  i couldn't even  get through  the school day  i had to go home  i think my mommy  had to pick  oh yeah  nothing worse  than crying  with my card  all just ruined  by this asshole  look at what you did 
[02:47:30]  mommy  look at what you did  it's okay  we'll get another  it's impossible  look it's funny now  but when you're 11 or 12  that was my whole world  was that dumb card  what else did i have  yeah it was like currency  right  baseball cards  were your currency  in school  we all had shit  we bragged about  that was my thing  but it was for show and tell  yeah brought in for show and tell  so you brought it  what did you carry  into school in  i don't remember anymore  probably tinfoil or something  i probably  plastic bag  probably a plastic bag  ziplock  yeah  i mean i didn't like 
[02:48:00]  go crazy like  trying to protect these cards  but i i i carefully  you know had them uh  did you explain the pen marks  when you showed it  and these were just added  by the gentleman here  with the molesting parents  he did it after i showed the card  and then now we're  eating fucking milk  milk and cookies or something  why did you get your client  put away by that point  because people wanted  to check it out  they thought it was fucking cool  i would have told them  to leave their filthy hands off it  what did the teacher do  i don't remember  my memory sucks  because i was mentally  abused by my mom 
[02:48:30]  for many decades  so i i tend to forget  a lot of stuff  did you block things out  oh yeah  do you think so  oh yeah  fuck yeah  really creepy stuff  nah not really  just  a lot of yelling  where do you think  i get my yelling  any hitting  no not really  no  i wouldn't spoon every once  in a while  you know  oh god  i was just  weeping in school  you were a weeper too  weeping  just crying all the time  a cry baby  yeah  baby  baby  stick my head in gravy 
[02:49:00]  yuck  i just was  god  what was wrong with me  you're sensitive  i thought like  no  you know what it was  i thought i would get like sympathy  it was  there's a crying little student  standing foot up  i thought i would get sympathy  if like i cried in school  yeah  it was more like  like obviously  it was  i wasn't always that upset  sam is now just  putting crying children 
[02:49:30]  up on the screen  go to www  aww  yeah so i thought like  if i was crying  i'd get like more attention  you're right  people would feel sorry for me  like the teacher  what a fag  and girls  that wasn't a way to get girls  by the way  i was crying  no  no  it's the way to not get them  the tough guys always got them  of course  the guys that made me cry  were the ones  you had your fucking  kleenex rolled up in your sleeve  like a tough guy  yeah hold on  weeping  fucking crying 
[02:50:00]  over the dumbest shit  that time i brought in  those stupid fucking cookies  for ethnic food day  and what'd they call them  balls of shit  they were like  they were like  these little  chocolate  balls  chocolate salty balls  and and my mother bought them  because it was like  you had to bring in  from your background  a type of food  so  i brought those in  and no one ate them  because  they said they looked like 
[02:50:30]  shit balls  and  just started crying  because i felt all  yeah  i felt embarrassed  and then i felt bad  from  from my mother  because she bought them  thinking it was a good thing  and  and everything  and then i had to go home  and tell her that  she bought shit balls  do they all laugh at you  yeah  your little shit ball cookies  they laugh  and  and we're pointing at it  and he goes  it looks like  duty  no one ate my shit balls  so i cried 
[02:51:00]  what an asshole  why were we all  emotional wrecks  at 11  12  i don't think we're  i think most people  listening to us  were emotional wrecks  at 10  11  12  13  yeah  i don't know what the fuck  it was  what the fuck was wrong with us  because all those hormones  were trying to figure out  what the fuck  crying  just  just raging in your body  you ever cry in school jimmy  i'm sure i did  uh  yeah i'm sure i did  from rejection  yeah  some type of rejection 
[02:51:30]  he was a very emotional boy  let me say  many emotions  when i broke my arm  uh  i got so much attention  from having a cast on  i can't even look at you  when you tell this one  it was great  yeah so when the cast came off  i tried to break my arm again  on the water fountain  i just like hit my arm  on the water fountain  trying to break  so i would get another cast  and people would let  you know  pay attention to me  because i had a cast on  was it a sincere  like really hard bashing  or no  i couldn't  was it a very lame  i couldn't commit  of course you could  i couldn't commit to the break 
[02:52:00]  yeah  no it's hard  because you want to commit  but at the last second  your body kind of says no  i couldn't do it  and slows down  the impact  jerk  and then it hurt  so i started crying  of course you did  fucking asshole  i love it  i thought you weren't kidnapped  by some molester in utah  oh he'd have dumped me off  sure he would have  shut up kid  i had my throat slit  before i was sexually assaulted  just to shut me the fuck up  god and you just brought up  a memory that i forgot  i punched a brick wall 
[02:52:30]  because uh  my my hand was healing  and i was getting  so much attention too  and so my hand  was healing  and i wasn't ready  to let go  of the attention  so i started  punching the wall  with my hand  that was like  75% healed  because i wanted  to continue  being in the cast  this craving  attention bullshit  that's why we ended up  here by the way  i totally  dude i totally forgot  about that  until you just said it  i did the exact same thing  that's why we're fucking  here in front of microphones  at this  it's it's 
[02:53:00]  it's not coincidental  that uh  we're we're doing this  and we we're all fucked up  as kids trying to get attention  it makes perfect sense now  i was down to an ace bandage  and i had a couple more  doctor visits left  yeah  so i started punching  a brick wall  i i like jimmy said  this is something i blocked out  until you just mentioned  that story  yep  and then i started  punching the brick wall  but like at the last second  you can't commit  you just can't commit  so you're hitting  but not as hard  no that's  that you need to  that's a little bit 
[02:53:30]  of sanity  showing its way through  that you just  at the last minute  your survival instinct  kicks in and says  you can't do that  i was getting attention  from girls  they they were  yeah  paying attention  to me a little more  girls was like  they asked a lot of questions  right all that shit  sign the cast  oh get better  and i'd be like  look at their names  and go oh look  and then they cut the cast off  and i'm like  now i'm just a kid  with one atrophied hairy arm  would you come on their names  uh no this was before  comesies  yeah i didn't either  this was like when i was 
[02:54:00]  i guess i was uh  uh nine or ten  something like that  yeah you tried to break  your arm again  nine  yeah i tried to break it  they took the cast off  and for like one day  it was kind of like  oh you got your cast off  and i was like  yeah yeah  oh look at my arm  it looks all funny  and everything like that  and nobody cared  and then no one gave a shit  so i'm like  i went up to the water fountain  and i hit it  and it hurt  so i thought maybe  it was broken  so i had to go home then  and tell my mommy  i went  i ran around the corner 
[02:54:30]  in school  and i hit my arm  on the water fountain  and i think i broke it again  and she's like  no you didn't break it  until you hit it  on the whites only sign  fucking creep  so the thing is  i kept nagging her  about this fucking  broken arm thing  ew you kept pushing it  i kept pushing like  i think i broke it  can you take me  to the doctor  what a dick  so she actually  went alright  she took me to the doctor  and they went  to take x-rays  and i'm like  hmm  there's gonna be  no break here  so i actually 
[02:55:00]  on the bottom  of my arm  i drew in pen  two lines  hoping that  when it was  on the x-ray machine  it would show up  as like  through the x-ray  as breaks  in the two bones  the ulna  and the radius  you tried drawing  breaks on the outside  you tried fooling  the medical community  with a pen  the doctor  with a pen mark  on my  bottom of my arm  as i placed it  on the fucking  x-ray machine  you're psychotic 
[02:55:30]  just so they might  see it and go  wow yeah  look at that  it's broken  she should have  taken it to the gyno  fucking creep  check out my  veg  yuck  your son's arm  is fine  his pussy's got  a problem  that's great  watch your arms  stupid  you got pen marks  on there  exactly  you should have  his fucking  tear ducts  sewn up  obviously overused  fucking a  i love that story  let me go to the phone  i don't want to  lose chris in jersey  chris how are you  buddy  hey what's up guys  i just want to 
[02:56:00]  tell you that  when i was a little  kid in elementary  school we had  something called  international day  and we had to  come in and  represent our  culture our  heritage and  so i'm partly  german so i  said my mom made  me dress up  uh and leader  hose in that  food from like  germany and  stuff like that  it was really  embarrassing  yeah you can't  make your kid  dress up  oh no  like that  i know  anthony's got a

[02:59:00]  behind me  decided to  try and piss  between my  legs  piss all over  me  and on our  field trip  i had to wear  the teacher's  retard blue  sweatpants  with my polo  shirt tucked  in  and what  happened to  the guy  that pissed  on you  oh he just  pretty much  he's on a  radio show  now with  hope  he happened  thank you  matt  let's say  hi to victor  in baltimore  victor  hey good  morning  i said i'm  sorry  what's that 
[02:59:30]  i said tell  that last  caller  i said i'm  sorry  i tried to  go over  his shoulder  but it went  between his  legs  look at that  connecting the  last caller  i like that  i like that  it's always good  i like that  were you the  guy that peed  on his pants  no i peeped  got it  hey listen  when i was a  kid in school  one of the  things i tried  to do is  i wanted to  get out of  school so i  went to the  nurse and i  took a  thermometer  told her i  had a fever  she gave me a  thermometer and i  rubbed it on my  corduroy pants a 
[03:00:00]  little too long  i said like  109  109 fever  yeah that'll do  it  yeah stupid  six-year-old  what are you  gonna do  anyway what i  wanted to say  is aunt's mom  probably got  charged with  child abuse  and munchausen  syndrome you  go up to the  doctor so much  all the time  yeah what's  your problem  they didn't have  that shit back  then it was  just called a  dumb kid that  uh craved  attention i  always got my  tummy aches too  my stomach hurts  anytime there was  a problem my  stomach hurts 
[03:00:30]  oh the car won't  start  oh we're stuck  in the you know  on the side of  the road the car  broke down  my stomach hurts  my father would  turn around  go stop  shut up the  car's broken  bro shut  him the fuck  up  he was an  angry man  of course he  was  he's right  how do you  not  to my mother  she was a  bitch on  wheels back  then  let's go to  scott in  new hampshire  scott  my father was  in the air  force i was  always going to 
[03:01:00]  different schools  all the time  and made fun of  because i was fat  and stuff so i  used to go in  the bathroom  the night before  my first day and  i just started  smashing myself in  the face until i  get a black eye  and uh you know  tell him i got  the fighter i was  tough or whatever  and um my  parents were so  oblivious they  wouldn't even  notice in the  morning that i  had this huge  shiner  so you used  to try to give  yourself black  eyes for  attention  well that and i 
[03:01:30]  was afraid to  get beat up so  i figured i'd look  tough with my  black eye you  know yeah yeah  trying to look  tough  when you're 12  it was a scary  world out there  oh yeah  oh yeah  you gotta protect  yourself  all right thank  you guys  and look at this  guy dennis in  yonkers dennis  hey guys what's  going on  uh came from a  big family when i  was a kid um we  didn't we didn't  have the most money  so we had a wood  burning stove and  we were put in  charge of keeping  it keeping it lit and  keeping the house 
[03:02:00]  warm so everybody  was out and i thought  it would be a good  idea for some  attention to pin my  arm against the hot  cast iron as long  as i could and  give myself a nice  burn horrible horrible  idea because they  didn't come home for  like another two hours  and i just sat there  with a burning arm  oh my god  you idiot  see this is more  normal than you  realize  attention  just want the  attention  that's what's great  about having a radio  show then you  realize okay all that  sick shit you did as  a kid you're like  okay it was it was 
[03:02:30]  the norm  what are you looking  at  the one you just  highlighted  which one  i think john  oh yeah yeah  jesus  poor fuck  john in new york  what's going on  oh dear friends  i was living in  manhattan and then  we moved up to the  suburbs so i've never  been on a school bus  mind you i've never  been on a school bus  before first day on a  school bus let me  preface it by saying  that we had sunday  sunday italian dinner 
[03:03:00]  the night before and  as soon as the bus  starts moving ten  minutes later i proceed  to up chuck spaghetti  and meatballs oh you  know how bad puked up  spaghetti smells too  the entire ride the  spaghetti and the  meatballs were just  rolling down  swallowed them whole  of course of course  the kids started  laughing and then  they proceeded to  label me barferroni  for the next two  years  barferroni 
[03:03:30]  the worst  how long did that  excuse me  how long did  nickname last  barferroni  years  like i think the  next three years  until i left for  junior high  i just wanted to  kill myself  you didn't realize  that one incident in  school would just  haunt you for the  rest of your life  you get a nickname  because of one dumb  thing you did one  day  and then now you're a 
[03:04:00]  senior and they're  still calling you  piss pants or  whatever the fuck  you did  unless you move  away or you know  go to a different  school  yeah you gotta go  into the witness  protection program  and move to another  school  that's pretty much  what it was as a  kid the witness  protection program  was when your  family moved  if you were like  pee pee pants  or a pukey kid  or shitty caca pants  and you got a fresh  start  like i gotta leave  one of the treats  our family got was  we got to take a  bath by ourselves  by yourself 
[03:04:30]  one of seven kids  we would pile into  the bathtub all the  time  but every once in  a while you would  get that one  one day where you  could have a bath  by yourself  where you know  as one of your  brothers you could  sit there and blow  yourself  well sure that  might have happened  in the bath all  alone  he might not like  us talking about  that anymore  but it might have  happened  now that he's a  a business owner  and uh  so i went to my  mom one day  and i'm like hey  i want to you know  i want to take a 
[03:05:00]  bath  i want to do that  bath thing  and she goes  you're not dirty  enough  i was only like  10 or 11  so i went outside  and i proceeded  to just like  try to make myself  real dirty  and i came in  like a dirty mess  she said you're  still not dirty  enough  and i went back  outside crying  like a little  baby again  trying to get  dirty enough  so i could  take my stupid  bath by myself  that's pretty bad  fucking insane  right  but you you just  reminded me of  something now  that that is  really really bad  this is really bad 
[03:05:30]  are you embarrassed  yeah  yeah  because the  dirty thing  this this  got me  oh no  and then i think  i got beat  for trying to get  you know  too dirty  for a bath  really  i think  but they found  out  that's why  a lot of my  stories tail off  because then i  don't remember  because i have to  block shit out  what's your story  i was i was going  to day camp  and um  and i i again  wanted attention  uh so i um uh  there was part of 
[03:06:00]  these woods that  were on fire a few  years ago back so  there was still a  lot of carbon and  stuff on the trees  okay sure sure so i  rubbed that all over  my face and my arms  and and i i said  that um i i was uh  like abducted and  and tied to one of  these trees uh and  then i had to climb  up the tree backwards  all the way up to  where it was cut off  at the top right 
[03:06:30]  because it was like  maybe 12 feet high  because it had been  burnt and the top  was kind of pointy  and and it was all  burnt and i had to  climb up backwards  with my arms like no  one could do this but  i had to climb up and  and i remember coming  out of the woods like  like i was all like  oh oh all  disheveled and full  of the the the carbon  and charcoal from  yeah and and i was  i was walking like i  was ready to fall  down like the little  kid that comes back 
[03:07:00]  to the village in  indiana jones and  the temple of jones  that's that's how i  was walking like  and then oh my god  were they looking for  somebody i hate you  sorry i was so bad  you never can they  they bought your story  uh no i don't think  so but you know  they had a look  no day camp  yeah but you know  were the police  ever called  uh no i think the  counselors just  looked yeah  which tells me  that they obviously  didn't believe me 
[03:07:30]  psychopath they  obviously didn't  believe me right  um i'd love to see  you a little walk  and your eyes half  closed like oh  it's exactly what it  was my eyes are half  closed i was walking  like oh i got out of  it oh and no you  know no rope or  anything i said i you  know slipped the rope  where is it i don't  know i said i went  away yeah what  happened to the rope  i don't know  oh was i the worst  what the fuck was  wrong with that 
[03:08:00]  fucking nerd that's a  bad one that that's a  bad one that's pretty  bad the feigning  abduction yeah  abduction fucking  anthony hurst rob a  bank to you fucking  creeper  abduction  uh wait listen to  this story sean in  georgia sean yeah  hey buddy i dislocated  my knee playing hot  or dislocated my knee  and i'm playing hockey  and i got a good bit  of attention from the  school so when it got  better it pigeon went  away so i decided to 
[03:08:30]  try it again and what  i thought i'd do would  be run towards the  gopher tortoise hole  and take my foot in it  that way i'd fall  forward and it would  dislocate my knee again  toe well i did and i  fell face first and  broke my nose and got  made fun of because of  that  plan didn't quite pan  out did it  yeah they they rarely  do  he rarely do  trying to hurt yourself  for attention story by  the way where he tried  to throw himself down 
[03:09:00]  seven flights of stairs  to kill himself  to kill himself  yeah that's different  i wasn't like you know  i'm trying to kill  myself i was just  trying to you should  have hurt myself  enough where people  would care about me  and and and give me  attention every day and  love me i hate your  predator story that you  just that's a great  story yeah yeah it was  really bad you had to  shimmy up a 12 foot  tree yeah backwards with  the rope tied behind  how'd your feet dig in 
[03:09:30]  i i just climbed up and  and i used the rope and  i pulled tight and then  i'd shimmy up a little  bit with my feet and then  put the rope back up  like i described the  whole that i had to  figure out my head how  i how i did it meanwhile  i just was sitting there  rubbing the carbon off  the tree and and rubbing  it on my face why your  face it looked so bad  exactly why not your  back exactly it was not  on my back it was on my  face and my arms and i  was just and then i came  stumbling out of the  woods stumbling that's 
[03:10:00]  great stumbling waiting  for somebody to go like oh  my god what happened but  no one did no one  actually go up to  somebody and say uh that  was just tied to a tree  ever no one can like i  thought i here was my  scenario in my head i  come stumbling out of  the woods with all this  charcoal on me and like  the counselors go drop  everything and like oh  my god what happened and  i tell them and they're  like oh no and they feel  bad for me and they they  there's a manhunt looking  for this uh person that did 
[03:10:30]  this and i'm like you  know oh so glad you're  okay yeah yeah they're  like oh my god anthony  thank god you're okay  but i staggered like that  and no one cared you're  acting like they're just  playing kickball and they  should have played kick  anthony we could have we  could have lost you yeah  yeah something like that  like oh my god oh what a  dick oh just what a dork  well we all did dorky  things baby that is that's

[03:13:30]  deranged serial killer looking well  they didn't have the suvs in the  minivans so yeah if you saw one of  those on the highway it was two things  a family with a lot of kids like yeah  like like my family or someone going  to a dead show the thing is the family  with a lot of kids usually had the  station wagon and the volkswagen  minibus was reserved for real like  lunatics and and hippies well you've  met my family wouldn't you know okay  draw your own conclusion well they ain't  my friend no thanks yeah what seven 
[03:14:00]  kids you can't fit seven kids in the  volkswagen you get them in a station  wagon i'm in the station wagon you can  not really oh yeah they you put the  youngest one in that seat that faces  backwards so they could pick their nose  and wave to the people and someone on  the hump so the story goes my brother  Elmo's already checking in the guy who  designed the the now famous wow bumper  sticker by the way yes he's a bitter man  so this is going to get a little ugly  but basically uh yeah dad said that uh  here i'll get him involved with this  this story hopefully brett will call in 
[03:14:30]  too  Elmo hey what's up hey i was telling this  story yesterday and you weren't  listening obviously yeah well i was my  psychiatrist told me not to call in i  was cringing in the corner  obi erneo wants to know if you guys  called it the buski the buski yeah cute  i'm never gonna live that one down  about as long as we remember so so elm um  you remember right we're all little  kids well first uh like you said the  seven kids but then we also had  karen whoever she was oh yeah yeah  chick who lived with us that's right 
[03:15:00]  i forgot about a chick that lived with  you yeah like she got kicked out of her  family so we like kind of i don't know  we adopted her for two or three years  how old was she she was like hot she  was hot she was like a teenager i never  heard about that i forgot she was like  she was uh yeah she was in high school  and she used to walk around the house  with no bras on and stuff it was really  hot i forgot about it because there's  five boys but cousin oliver of the  hughes house but she kind of looked  like us they kind of looked at like  look like us and uh she looked like us  and they kind of try to pass her off 
[03:15:30]  like she was a real sister what is this  little house on the prairie aren't there  records of who owns who all sudden like  she showed up and and they try to pass  her off like yeah she's a long lost  sister i forgot about that she was a  little runaway causing havoc a little  ragamuffin in mankato so we brought her  back to walnut grove and then it was our  version of oliver actually yeah and then  uh and then like she had it with my  parents and she left one day that was  it but she was a member of our family for  two or three years i forgot about that  made us all look at each other and wonder 
[03:16:00]  like are we all natural children they just  take you up at the mall we even we we  cared about her so much we even put her  in the cement outside our house in the  cement dude i gotta ask you though how old  were you guys during this time we were  like 10 11 did you have some kind of  crush on this check oh yeah she was hot  wow you didn't hear me she used to walk  around move or something she used to  walk around the house with no bras on  little hippie clothes and stuff and and  we were  we'll tell the cement story another day  elms because we don't have kissing  contests or something no i don't know 
[03:16:30]  no what are you doing you want any  piece of us no are you kidding she was  five of us she was gonna choose she was  banging guys in our attic though another  story for another day but uh yeah so so  we had to do a lot of uh cement work  around our house yeah and uh she made  the masons that you are the work you  guys have to do wait a minute if elms  it wasn't a house it was a barrack you're  either plowing the fields with your  bicycles or uh or uh doing cement work  all right here hey they had to empty the 
[03:17:00]  cement out of the bag so they could take  them to school for lunch you guys you  guys you guys have the best upbringing  all right so uh you know what it is it  sounds like like the the typical american  family just off kilter just a bit you  know because you're all together you're  going on vacation you're doing these  family things but it's just somehow not  quite right it always took a wicked right  so elmo tell uh tell anthony about the 
[03:17:30]  cement brett had brett has the best  stories about the cement we we cemented  everything around our house everything  and we're convinced it was just to keep  us busy and keep us out of our mom's  hair just do things yeah our dad would  just be as a something i've never heard  of until him a cement fetish i guess we  had cement paths going everywhere you  needed those we cemented so many paths in  in our backyard we finally asked our dad  why don't you just cement the whole yard 
[03:18:00]  over and paint it green right it was  because that's what it was like he was  into cementing and rock walls rock walls  yeah where we would have to take the  volkswagen bus to like basically other  people's property and steal their rocks  wait you would you would you would take  rocks and just stack them up and we  haven't we had to you know go on a  scavenger hunt and get like rocks from  the woods my dad would pull up i'm not  kidding back then you know the centerport  area and stuff it's not as built up as 
[03:18:30]  it is now he would just pull up to a  hill and go all right kids and we'd have  to go running out and find rocks rocks the  perfect size little bastard perfect size  rocks for uh you know rock walls and if  we were on someone's property my dad  would just say oh these crazy kids you  know i can't control them they just go  out stealing rocks we had a sand pit to  get our sand to make our cement right in  the backyard so you would mix it all up  yeah mix the cement and we were eight or  nine mixing cement from scratch that's 
[03:19:00]  wrong all day long all day long not i'm  not kidding as brett said in between  the barracks yeah and it was like barracks  because we had like uh there was a time  we had five boys in one room two bunk beds  as the chick is uh having sex in the attic  oh yeah god damn this is twisted well you  know what that i uh that's this that's my  other sister what one of her boyfriends  was living in our attic and and we didn't  know for a really long time  right elms that's right come on tell me 
[03:19:30]  i'm lying i know it but the guy like he  was like he was a he was you know in  harborfield's terms yeah a greaser right  he smoked some of that uh pot had the  leather jacket the whole deal sure well  all you harborfield's guys are greasers  when you talk about greasers he was like  like the greaser and he got kicked out of  his house and he was dating my sister  and uh my sister got the bright idea that  he could live uh in the attic live in the  attic and we would hear him banging  around up there speak clearly no we're not 
[03:20:00]  this is no joke we used to hear noises  from the attic and it would scare us because  we're just little kids still 10 11 12 like  did you hear that yeah man there's  something up in the attic and we would  tell our parents and they're like you're  you're out of your effing minds there's  nothing in the attic you know well dad  would say yeah there's something up  there and it'll get you if you don't do  your cement work so how did we discover  that he was living up there because my  sister would bring him food and stuff i  think it was that one night where we  woke up with my mom screaming  hysterically what are you doing 
[03:20:30]  i believe that's how it started  but hey i could be wrong  so a little fun history fact yeah rock  walls were built by field hands in the  winter to keep farm hands from leaving and  going to find other work in the 18th and  19th centuries hey thanks  you might want to know why you were doing  it so i don't know he made a lot of noise  one day my mom discovered it and he was  kicked out of our attic but uh so all right 
[03:21:00]  getting back to the family vacation so dad  like uh you know summer was coming and  he was telling us about this visit this  great family vacation we were going to  take upstate new york you remember what  town no it was like way up in the  catskills i blocked it out yeah it was  way up there it was way up there anthony  so he's telling us uh you know we're  gonna be way up in the mountains uh this  uh you know terry's uh uncle uh you know  uh he's got this property with a house and  all these shacks that he rents out and 
[03:21:30]  there's a stream and all your dreams will  come true oh they made it sound like it  was incredible paradise we were going to  be there for a week and and all you kids  will have your own cabin and there's a  pool sounds great you can run around the  woods to your heart's content and burn  them down fish in the stream and stuff  right so it was it had to be what an  eight to ten maybe twelve hour trip yeah  it took days to get there when you're  taking seven kids you stop a lot you  know somewhere along the uh along the  way we we discovered the i told a lot of 
[03:22:00]  this yesterday but my brother's gonna  help me out with some details i forgot so  uh somewhere along the way we discovered  that the reason we were going to see my my  sister's uncle was because she inherited  his property because he recently died and  that kind of came to light in the back of  the uh of the van there yeah and when you  huddled around and terry finally whispered  to us yeah when you're when you're ten and  eleven and and you hear like anything to  do with death you you just freaks you  out without a doubt you you don't 
[03:22:30]  understand it at all so uh we finally  pull up to this place basically my sister  was in her in the property they want to  see what it was all about and see you  know see what they could do with it uh we  pull up to the place alms you want to  take it from there well it's supposed to  be our stars our family summer vacation in  paradise in the middle of the mountains  our paradise our our hawaii in new york yeah  yeah this is like the brady bunch  going to hawaii right instead we get out  there's a rusted crippled fence around 
[03:23:00]  what i assume was a pool but you don't  know what it was just bobbing beer cans  everywhere the second we exited the  vehicle in a timely manner we were swarmed  by insects that the size of bats oh i  forgot about it was mosquitoes like you  wouldn't believe just swarming going  for my little brothers uh the most  because i guess they're young skinners  so they were like taken down hey was  that the what was this the same trip  when um where uh brett saved his twin

[03:25:00]  and it's just like you know you're  driving along and you see that duck the  the mother duck and all the little ducks  trying to cross the street it's pretty  tough to keep an eye on everybody  keep them together  plus we were waiting for karen to get all  wet and you know sure sure so all i  remember was i was i was kind of in the  i don't know where i was but i remember  the screams like oh my god my mom's losing it  quinn is taking off down the rolling  rabbits and my mom's like oh the river's  got another one and my and my brother 
[03:25:30]  jumped in and saved them yeah oh yeah that  makes for a fun ride the rest of the day  oh my god you almost died yeah i know man  near death you have a wet scared to death  four-year-old kid going to see a dead  guy's house that's a dream vacation right so  yeah back to the day's house so then yeah we  discovered that the guy recently died and we  were you know checking out the property so to  figure out what we're going to do with it  that you that he already described the  pool the grass wasn't cut for probably  over a year because it was what four feet  high yeah you lost yourself in it now 
[03:26:00]  what did this guy that died owned this  uh hotel thing or yeah it was on the whole  thing no joke the house with like ten  outhouses in the woods yeah he rented out  ten little shacks that were kind of in  the woods right i've seen those those  places we've seen them you drive by there  and go who the f would ever ever stay  there right and they don't they don't  clean them out often and stuff so and  then we uh discover uh the way the guy  died uh well he uh he was uh smoking in  bed and uh and he burned himself up in  half the house so then uh i went inside 
[03:26:30]  why'd you go in i made the cut because i  guess i was just a little older because  darren's only what you're two years younger  than me and you yeah you didn't go in no  because we're all trying to go in just to  avoid the mosquito taking us away into the  woods yeah my dad's like you don't want  to go in there and what i saw was  horrific i mean we got we walked into  where he died and it was like just  charred remains i mean you knew you saw  where the bed was and it was just just  just burn marks everywhere the wall was  gone because it's fire that took him him 
[03:27:00]  in the room away  dude these are all little house on the  prairie stories i got it you guys aren't  making this up  every one of these stories has been in an  episode of little house on the prairie  and then there's a guy the caretaker of the  place who who uh looked at us like we  don't get many people in these parts since  they built that new super highway  we're like what is going on and oak was  our big brother who we look up to oh yeah  comes out of the house and we just need  to look in his face like oh my god horror 
[03:27:30]  now we're scared to death we're scared to  death and we're like we're supposed to  stay here a week a week not a day it  wasn't like we had to do this it was a  hassle we're moving on to bigger and  better things no this is our family  vacation so then uh my dad who just  nothing phases my my part nothing in  the world is like okay so uh you know  uh everyone pick a cabin we are just  scared escalates it turns out like six  of us stayed in one cabin because we  weren't we weren't you know separating  for anything strength in numbers and  then what the cabins had like big 
[03:28:00]  spiderwebs and mosquitoes and the bed  wasn't changed and who knows how long  old sheets there was a straw in the  corner and it was like a horror movie  where you're yelling at the screen when  some guy says oh i'm gonna go get a  coke and you're like no he's going to  die we're all huddled in there and  somebody's hungry it's like fight the  hunger fight the hunger we gotta go  out until daylight remember we had our  our little baseball match we're like  all right well we'll just have a little  catch you know get our mind off what's  going on around us and we'd like 
[03:28:30]  through it like twice and then had to  run back in the cabin we were scared  as there any tv or anything no no nothing  oh tv running water would have been a  luxury so at this point my mom is just  losing it just screaming at freddie  my dad's taking the uh burnt sheets  from the bed saying hey we could brush  these off and you know they're fine you  know he's exaggerating a little bit but  my dad like i said nothing fazes him he  would almost do that so then uh my mom  you know got us out what first thing in  the morning i mean daylight was coming up 
[03:29:00]  and it's like pack the car we are out of  here don and we drove into town to get i  don't know the a town that was kind of  like a ghost town ish thing really small  town in the middle of nowhere we get  like a kind of a better bed and  breakfast place and my dad's like hey  why don't we uh go to a movie to uh you  know you know get our minds off uh what  happened because my mom's just freaking  at this point the only movie playing in  town at this theater that shows one movie  was one flew over the cuckoo's nest 
[03:29:30]  nice r-rated movie for  for the seven kids and and karen so you  all drove you went to a drive-in or  it was no we obviously couldn't go see  one flew over the cuckoo's nest so then  we're gonna say a drive-in you could take  him we were just stuck yeah the people  like oh you're the ones who were inheriting  the old hopkins  you better watch out  some say he didn't start that fight  yeah that's with the micro bus you guys 
[03:30:00]  like scooby effing do  with the mystery machine so i wish brett  called in because he had a few more details  but actually brett is here  he's there one last thing about the uh  the bus to remember dad turned the seats  around so we faced each other yeah so  that's what you want as an adult you  want to be driving for two straight days  while eight kids are facing each other  screaming and yelling and fighting all right  does brett have anything to add to this or  no he's trying to call in i believe  i want to know more about this mysterious karen chick  where is she now we don't know i don't know 
[03:30:30]  she one day she was gone she lived with you for how long  uh a couple years at least a couple of years  and now you just don't know where she is  this girl was like an older sister to you  hold on for two years and you have no clue what  happened to her wait elmo yeah i can't believe you  hold on i'll wait uh so what happened to the girl yeah  she couldn't take my mom yeah and uh one day she was just  crying in the in the kitchen as as like her boyfriend was  loading up a pickup truck and said i'm leaving and at this  point we consider her sister yeah you kind of get after three years i would 
[03:31:00]  think and we hugged her and we figured out we'll  we'll meet her at friendlies you know and one of these days  one of these days never seen her again that was it she's gone  she vanished wouldn't it be interesting to find her  i hear she's like in the area and has kids and stuff  wow so that's something but she was like uh like the  warden's daughter when we're out in the field and doing  the cement and she'd bring out lemonade and we're like thank you  wap it off boss we'd be staring at her you know wiping our brow 
[03:31:30]  wap it off boss last day boss water boss that's funny  bathroom break boss bathroom break boss was she wearing daisy dukes  no she'd be there in a nice like yellow flower summery dress pour that cement  convict  plow them fields the only good thing about the cement in the backyard was  eventually it took over all the fields so we didn't have to work in the field  anymore just cement work in the fields this is children growing up we planted 
[03:32:00]  stuff in our backyard we had a mini farm man that's a story for another day  i like new families like this but i never like uh had the in-depth stories like this  but there were always these families that had a lot of kids and then just  drifters that would come in for some reason and just stay there and and then  leave and hey man we have a ton of them that came and went and they'd all like  because there are a lot of families like this especially on long island right  i was friends with a few people that were in families like this and and then 
[03:32:30]  there'd be like the guy that they just pick up some oh he had problems with his  family and drugs so we brought him in oh yeah there's a keeper we're always  bringing people in yeah one day they just stay and like all right i guess  accept it don't ask hold on let me put uh let me put rob on rob what's up hey man  what's up rob i gotta let anthony know all these stories are true especially bringing in the new  people because you know quinn and brett would come home from school or something hey you want  to come over and have some dinner sure and you sit down for dinner and there's a guy that's 
[03:33:00]  you know right in a room upstairs who could be like a serial killer sitting next to you  like trying to eat dinner and keep an eye on him at the same time  you know he tells the truth i don't know who this is what's up rob hey man what's happening  all right buddy good job man had a good time all right cool just some guys hit me hey what's up  hey we need the extra money they were running rooms man i'm on the lamb hey brett yeah here's my other  brother what's up man you guys got me shaking memories huh i'm in the corner crying we told the story 
[03:33:30]  right that's about it yeah but don't talk about my twin brother falling into the river remember  that yeah who do you think pushed them how'd you like growing up with the twin all your life  i want that boy gone brett were you with him when he fell in yeah see i never saw that but i i remember  he was gone and scott jumped in and grabbed him i can see a poor little kid leaning over the rock 
[03:34:00]  leaning leaning just wants to touch the water oh there he goes he's leaning over the rocks with his  little cup because we had no water in the car after the 20-hour drive he wanted to drink some  water my dad thought it'd be brilliant that we get some fresh spring water from the mountains  so we all did a little chain thing from over the rocks each one held on to a hand and my twin  brother was in the lead i was right behind him i said you know what my birthday is coming up  we're always splitting gifts and whatnot so there he goes you guys have to split gifts because you 
[03:34:30]  have the same birthday oh my god everything we had to share the same clothes everything  brett brett's got some great stories man hand me down from eight kids holy crow  let's not forget the time that quinn you know what in your mouth what  oh you what you want to go toe for toe with stories no i don't man well now you gotta tell that one  uh it's another bad tub incident yeah see we had like we had brett yeah you gotta you gotta tell 
[03:35:00]  the bath oh is this the bathtub water story no this is the truth this is horrible this is the truth  because one of seven you know we we didn't have much hot water so uh what what i i got to take a nice  hot bath and then you guys one by one would go in the water after me they never they didn't drain the  water like obi would take a bath and then the brothers had to all get in the family dog our 
[03:35:30]  collie would go before us that's how high in the rain he was but you were bathing in used bath water  well i used to go in there with like a little strainer to try to pick out the hair so the last two in  were were the twins man oh bathing in gravy like a pool skimmer we had to like skim the surface just to get in  in the soap scum that would be in there even after just one bath oh man you want to tell the story  with quinn or no we used to fight over the uh nozzles uh one was in the front one was in the back 
[03:36:00]  and we'd always argue back and forth who's gonna be in control of the water they were really little  right and because it was so rare to get hot water the first one in would take his legs and close off the  tub from the hot water again behind me where the other kid was sitting so i was i got there first  and i eat my little uh i guess well of hot water in front and i'm like oh hot water for heat hot water  my twin brother and i are arguing back and forth like no no they're fighting over hot water in a bathtub 
[03:36:30]  so he's like fine you're not going to let me know you're not going to have any hot water i'll do it  myself and i feel this trickle down my back i turn around but my mouth is wide open so i'm screaming  oh it was a disaster oh my god world war three basically his brother uh decided to make his own  hot water and uh and brett turned around at the wrong time there you go made his own hot water with his 
[03:37:00]  own hot water and when you turned around because you felt something on your back all of a sudden  when you turned around now it wasn't on your back anymore it was on your front oh because my mouth  and due to your screaming you can only imagine what was happening all right all right i think we all  know well there's just a little peek we can't tell them all today it's funny that by the last bath  i think that's almost like the garbage compactor in star wars 
[03:37:30]  a big snake in there we need to have a family day at the studio yeah 3po 3po open the door to the  compactor level we lost the twin yeah one of these days we'll do that all right i'm out there was the  family vacation story that's uh really really disturbing and you made me think of someone i haven't thought  of in years karen karen the hot karen the hot karen who got her name in the cement very good the 
[03:38:00]  cement still there oh yeah and your names are all in it oh yeah i've got to take a picture of it now  there you go come on that's a popular uh thing you put on the website now all right guys you done yep  all right there they go my a couple of my brothers i don't know how you you got this far  that is really bad no karen was not sold off into slavery how do you know you don't know where  she went i have no idea sharing the last and love an opie and antony family special hello friends

[03:39:00]  getting together for drug use stay tuned it's sharing the laughter and love an opie and anthony family  special coming soon to broadway jim norton of the opie and anthony show stars as that lovable redheaded  orphan in the new production of annie the sun will come out come on jimmy tomorrow you gotta lay in bed  and die of cancer tomorrow like yule brenner oh you used to be fun in the sun but now you're 
[03:39:30]  shitting in your bed and your head is full of mush like lyle alzado welcome back to sharing the  left and love an opie and anthony family special hi folks i'm jerry springer and we're back with  sharing the laughter and love an opie and anthony family special in this next clip little jim norton  came to the revelation about his parents when they went on vacation with another couple  he was convinced that they were swingers here it is 
[03:40:00]  i'm starting to suspect my parents are swingers and it's giving me the creep  i just heard somebody say something and i it couldn't have come out of anyone's mouth we just  saw your your your mom and dad uh at the hbo tape she's just a little like sweet little lady yes  you know something she looks like a librarian they were you know they were they were uh young 
[03:40:30]  in what the 60s and stuff so they probably have that mindset right yeah oh brother they went away  with another couple somewhere it just really gives me the crease where some island my dad gave me uh  left me a message and i forget where they went but it was like it just bothered me oh with another  couple i don't know why it annoyed me like it's it just is that the only reason you have to suspect  this are you just like i don't know or do they say things or or how funny would that be i mean 
[03:41:00]  they don't do anything obvious like they're not around they don't see like a ups guy with strapping  big arms and i catch my father going get his info it's nothing like that  so they went away with this other couple and you're just  anything else i just know that and there's something about the tone of the message you don't  want to the tone of the message what was the tone i don't know i just didn't know  no no you it just bothered no what but there's something in the message oh this is creeping me  out seeing jimmy so creeped out your mom drops like ecstasy and stuff no i don't think she's a 
[03:41:30]  drugs she probably has like a little uh what do older people drink something cream like a bailey's  a bailey's no i didn't know what did judy used to drink back in the day grandma yay yeah  yeah uh so what do you think like they're hanging out on vacation and then and then at one point  they'll go hey you know we're gonna we're gonna go into this room over here and some guy takes your  mom in there and no your dad takes some i hope they don't swap i hope oh wow i hope that they're 
[03:42:00]  i hope that they're view only and not swappers i hope my parents don't go oh no oh god do you  think that might be happening the swap i think your dad's just a watcher he probably is he just he  just sits in the corner nude and also it's a horrific face or happy to your mom we just saw them at the  hbo taping that's what makes this so hot hot my dad's a cuckold you think he just watches your dad 
[03:42:30]  watches from the corner of the bedroom and just like breaks down and cries you know your deviant  behavior has to come from somewhere so perhaps it wouldn't it wouldn't you know the obvious choice  is jimmy's dad but i think it's the mom i think she's into some freaky thing the log doesn't fall  far from the i don't know i just know that i got a message and it was uh what was it i i still have  it but i can't replay the whole thing that this part of it i'll see i'll have to i've only heard 
[03:43:00]  it one time i'm saved i'm like you can't replay the whole thing oh yeah your mom i'd get your mom on  the phone now but she's sucking no it was uh this hedonism is terrific we love this yeah they went to  some island with another couple and i don't know why it was like it all depends on the island i guess  what island bermuda something like that i don't know that bermuda is like bermuda that's that's  that's an old people is that old people's island yeah i don't know i don't know i don't know why it 
[03:43:30]  bothered me it shouldn't have what's the message i i have to go through it again there's stuff in there  probably what happens with the the message though that that there's something in that message what  is i don't know it was just he was saying hello you know hello to everybody and you know it was a very  nice message i don't know why oh he was a little too happy right well it was almost like a little too  happy on jimmy's uh voicemail it was i don't i don't know why it bugged me i can't put my finger  on it i don't maybe i've never heard them say anything like occasionally but i've been hanging  out with more couples lately i guess oh no like since they moved away my dad like retired they've 
[03:44:00]  been hanging out with more couples maybe they're just like um part of a nudist colony  but they don't use their real names my dad is a taffy bag jim maybe they're just like  part of a nudist colony well that's good somebody's suggesting uh they're drinking uh donald from  detroit harvey wall bangers i'll have a harvey wall banger oh they get me wild speaking of wall  banging oh i don't know you don't know just hit me to say i know i've heard them no yeah come on 
[03:44:30]  i can't picture that we just saw your parents down there in washington yeah they're not the swinging  type i never thought so either but lately they've been hanging with other couples and going away  with another couple is just creepy going away is too happy huh i don't know what it was about  the time i'll listen to it again i'll give you an update i don't know what the tone of the message  was i just i hadn't mentioned it happened like four or five days ago you didn't hear any moans  and groans in the background while your dad was on the phone with you is that mom you ever hear your 
[03:45:00]  parents having sex no um but i did many many years ago find a prophylactic in the toilet yeah oh my  when i was young i was probably 14 15 sorry guess they didn't want no you don't want to think  your dad's doing that but uh was your little brother in there there was a whole bunch of what could  have been and um yeah i found that it kind of it was supposed to have gone away and i guess the uh 
[03:45:30]  the water didn't take it where it was supposed to pop back up for a friendly hello wow that's  lovely it really is creepy to think about your parents having sex oh it's awful sharing the last  and love an opie and anthony family special i'm jerry springer in this next clip opie's brother calls in  the show to talk about an embarrassing position their parents have caught him in let's take a listen  so brett is it true that mom caught you completely naked in front of uh oh negative come on man now  you gotta tell the story the right way fred himself oh oh his dad yeah oh i thought it was mom which 
[03:46:00]  makes the story much better mom called me in another situation oh really we have yet to talk about that  one though your dad caught you though uh many years convinced her that i wasn't uh wasn't a mo  like me wait all right i want to know what that story is i forgot about that story that's a great  one oh wait wait wait wait wait not so much i wanted to give one it's kind of a wanted one  all right brett put that one together all right listen brett we're gonna count on you for a couple 
[03:46:30]  stories today it's brett day all right listen tell anthony uh of the story and how it goes with dad  catching you completely naked on the couch with the porno on well it was real dark outside  i have this uh bad habit when i get drunk i need to take all my clothes off i just i can't stand  having clothes i get all hot and sweaty and when i moved back from florida i stayed with my parents  for a little bit and my dad always had a porn station which we found out yesterday why somehow 
[03:47:00]  we couldn't get espn or hbo or it's all blocked out but amazingly the porn station always came  through dad's always outside fixing some wire now we know what it was our neighbors next door getting  the playboy bills and stuff right we're enjoying it all right so you come also come home really drunk  and i got the bug eyes going where you can barely focus you try and keep one eye open  all my senses are down because i'm really drunk i'm trying to listen for dotty which 
[03:47:30]  my mother upstairs listening for that one floorboard to creaking oh i gotta change the channel so i'm  really drunk i'm stripping my clothes off and you were uh taking care of business i was taking care  of business all right very good then what happened what a business was no blood circulation nothing  going on too much liquor in the body all right um so you really had to work things really really  really and i'm trying to focus my eyes i can barely see you and i'm like i think that's a  naked chick this is great this is really great so i guess uh one point i passed out passed out 
[03:48:00]  relieving the sprinkler and i guess an hour or so later i hear this dump dump dump on my forehead  and i look up and it's my father staring leaning directly over him like oh oh my god and there's a  sock stuck to my forehead dog hair from our collies and stuff and all the places it was a big mess  and my dad's words were wake up put your clothes on turn off the porn and go to bed 
[03:48:30]  oh you never want to hear your dad's paper sticking to my feet and it was just a big big ugly mess  oh that is embarrassing so later i was uh forced to move out of the house no you were but  oh that is that was for other reasons all right that is embarrassing you got to tell the mom's  story uh that would bury me oh go ahead i hope he buried himself yesterday it was pretty good go  ahead you were you were taking a bath was it i have a twin brother uh and when we're little we're 
[03:49:00]  always forced to take baths together because we have a conservative order my main time is like  bathing greg's dirty tepid pool of filth because they didn't want to drain the  the the bath the wait a minute you had to bathe in water that was already bathed in  not by one person there's my sister terry there's greg there's scott there's darren there's holly what  are you the ingles children from little house then we had to bathe our two dogs and  frank when you have to get in there so then we go in there we're stuck in this mess 
[03:49:30]  so the water's all dirty and cold it went by age though so i i got a nice uh nice bath  we couldn't really use the hot water because my father had the habit of always turn off the boil  right behind the couch gotta conserve electricity the twins are in the tub gotta conserve  so as a favorite to me uh my brothers and sisters were to relieve themselves and tell me  to make the water a little warm shake the dew off their dandelion if i may this is this is awful 
[03:50:00]  but this time my twin brother was feeling a little under the weather so i was all by myself in the  tub my third grade maybe fourth somewhere around there just this chick patricia johnson really had  my eyes she always looked at me i felt a little funny every once in a while all right just be careful  how you explain this uh get on that dumb butt nope all right go ahead so i'm in the  tub looking at the gi joe dolls on little boats and stuff not interested in me anymore my sister's 
[03:50:30]  barbie which i snuck in a couple times wasn't doing the job anymore so i started thinking about patricia  johnson and i thought and i thought and before you know it i was making a tent for a gi joe i guess you  could say was this the first time how come my brother yeah how come my brothers never told me about  this opa was always in the bathroom but geez could you have been doing this i thought it was a big 
[03:51:00]  secret like no one knew i wanted to tell my friends and that's down the road and i got in trouble for  that one school for sharing my new founded friend i guess you'd say with everyone guys you know you can  do this but anyway so i'm in the tub and i'm playing i'm gonna be more it's gotta be more and  not so much i wanted to give something but i kind of wanted something and noticing them you play golf  right anthony uh yeah have you ever heard the term when you smack the ball really far and you're like 
[03:51:30]  oh it's a great drive and it starts going and it kind of curves and they they call it long and wrong  right all right use imagination so things are built up like you know this is amazing  so it was a study in range you were enjoying yourself and and and and and like they say in  clerks you wanted to see if uh you could um oh is that what he was getting at right were you trying  to curl yourself up like a water bug i would see yeah okay all right we can figure that out all 
[03:52:00]  right we can figure that out can you ever see those roly-poly bugs they roll up in a ball when  you touch them mm-hmm yeah okay all right so you were trying to uh make like a water bug i discovered  at a young age i should be a gymnast the way i was maneuvering wait a minute were you able to  so i have things wrapped around shower curtains i have g.i joel's prop behind my head and i have  extra boats you know barbie dolls helping adjust and before you know it i'm like hey i think i'm there 
[03:52:30]  so i pushed a little hair out from you guys taking the bath and from the dogs and i moved  the dirt and i stick my head under the water because i need to i need the extra leverage i  guess though all right so your head went under the water so my head went under the water right  i'm doing something i i wanted not that i wanted to give and i guess during this whole entire time  while my head and ears under the water my mother's banging on the bathroom door trying to figure out  if i'm okay and without me even realizing it i'm thinking it's patricia johnson oh you're a 
[03:53:00]  wonderful girl wonderful a proud older brother here go ahead so i'm just thinking about that  my eyes are closed and i have this big fancy playing on the jungle gym for patricia we get it  dude move on then my eyes open up and i'm staring at my mother out of my mouth i'm like hey mom  screaming at the bathroom  they're never taking a bath by themselves again

[04:03:00]  need a basil oregano hybrid my uncle joe who builds guitars but in his spare time he's cross-breeding spices  spices and we all know you buy that one little jar of spice it lasts you like a decade last you  forever how much could he possibly grow and she uh she was like to my father you idiot it's not  marijuana and then uh my uncle joe had to cut them all down and uh hang them up the whole house dry 
[04:03:30]  him out i remember this house man the whole house when we walked in after school or anything when you've  been outside your mom allowed uh your uncle to dry it out in the house no he said he was getting rid  of it oh but he cut it up and dried it in the house and it was but you went down into his apartment  because we were kids you know when he'd leave we'd like go down and look at his groovy hippie apartment  there was parties going on in there uh i remember uh awful one of the rooms i believe it was the the  dining room there was an opening that used to lead right down to his uh like a window onto his 
[04:04:00]  apartment but he put this big uh smoked glass thing so you couldn't see down into it but in  one of the corners there was an opening so we'd have his pot parties in there and and there was  all kinds of ungodly hippie stuff going on nice and i used to peek in and look through the little  hole in the smoke glass at the parties that were going on but one night i'm watching tell me there was  an orgy no well there was all kinds of stuff going on in there believe me it was all kinds of fun 
[04:04:30]  stuff every party and uh one one night i'm looking and my sister walks into the kitchen and flips the  light on so now behind me i got this light now i was smart enough to know to keep the light out  through the smoked glass there's my big afro headed silhouette with with my face right against the  glass now everyone can see it everyone knows the light goes on yeah so i'm looking and dawn shuts the  light back out and i'm looking to go okay maybe they're not on to me out of nowhere a thumb full 
[04:05:00]  of clay goes right into my eye they plucked the people but the parties they used to have and we  like i said we walked in from school or whenever we'd be out playing and you're in the fresh air  walking in the house it reeked of pot so bad that if a cop ever even came near the house we'd have  all been uh but screwed right yeah right on a lot of fun a lot of fun with the drugs back then so  there you go sharing the life and love and opie and anthony family special i'm jerry springer let's 
[04:05:30]  go to sam and eric to see what's coming up after the break thanks jerry sam and eric here from the  opie and anthony show and when we come back anthony talks about having sex with family members well he  wanted to he didn't get quite the opportunity to do so so he says it didn't go unnoticed by the  show and he went into some really detailed thoughts that we just didn't really need to know when it  comes time for the family reunion who hasn't wanted to bang their cousin awkward stay tuned it's sharing 
[04:06:00]  the laughter and love and opie and anthony family special we're back with sharing the laughter and love  and opie and anthony family special i'm jerry springer sometimes opie and anthony share a bit more than they  should about their childhoods and this is one of those occasions gather around as a family and  enjoy together on sharing the laughter and love i had a crush on one of my cousins um growing up and 
[04:06:30]  you know what went over her house no no no no you don't just casually pass that by well i did this  comes up uh from time to time yeah yeah you're not supposed to have a crush on your cousin no but you  you do you do growing up especially uh at that age you know it was like anywhere between i think  don't well you don't i'm not we can't just let you slide well between like 12 and 16 i think i really  you know uh kind of i probably would have uh had sex with her i probably would have fun yeah it's not 
[04:07:00]  fine jimmy why not be the voice i did i didn't i didn't just because i i not for lack of i wasn't  trying i wasn't really pursuing it like trying but if if she would have turned around and said okay  i would have probably all right yeah i would have this cousin how is she related to you  it's i know she's a cousin but i mean no no it's it's first cousin okay so it's the first cousin  first cousin it's who's who's kid i don't think i should say at this point oh my god of course you 
[04:07:30]  shouldn't at least you're acknowledging that it's wrong jimmy it's wrong but it was years ago it's  wrong you're it was years ago and she was very hot you share the same blood that's creepy  share some other fluids exactly here's blood here's spit here's something else a little bleachy  enjoyed because you shouldn't have sex with someone that where you can recognize the smell here oh 
[04:08:00]  jesus boy that sums it up sure does see what what i'm saying is dude i even got it was during that  time of of life where you're just like pumping the hormones like but just like i i was a goat  just a horn dog and she was uh very attractive and i probably would have but you have big big doughy  eyes like you uh yeah yeah yeah and uh it would have been like their feet like having sex with me 
[04:08:30]  it would have been fantastic for myself staring at each other oh no no not not the same last name  and uh from different um not the same last name all right so it's your mom's sister's kid  damn it damn it no i well my father was an only child so it kind of blows that whole thing to hell  but but but but uh uh it was just one of those things like i i thought about it but couldn't do it 
[04:09:00]  and it would have let's say something happened 22 23 no no i said anywhere between 12 and 16  i was kind of like uh you know kind of like had the hots for her and how old was she um a little  younger yeah just a little not much around the same age yeah more uh but uh went over their house  once and um i i was uh using uh the bathroom off of uh her bedroom and i noticed that there were some 
[04:09:30]  panties on the floor and um i thought that was very cool what'd you do so nothing i didn't do anything  with them i really didn't i'd be completely honest with you as a guy with the hormones you know  rocking through your body when you did come across a pair of panties yeah here and there it was really  cool it was really cool wow i know what goes in this yeah it just gave you like an image like that  oh yeah and i did pick them up and look inside oh there you go so i didn't do anything until i did  investigate the csi it's murder she appeared to be 13 years all i could tell because the body goes 
[04:10:00]  through changes sand oh no gypsy's back part of human development it's a time of confusion and hormones  he's helping me out see he had gypsy understands what a young man is going through during that time  anthony looked like he spilled botulism in his underwear 
[04:10:30]  it was very tough you know very confusing time for me we got a lot of phone calls coming in from  kentucky no i swear to god this is they're all agreeing with you and let me tell you something  it had nothing to do with uh love or or uh wanting a relationship because you hear about things like  that cousins marrying each other things like that it was nothing to do with that it was blatant  just lust over a a girl that had a a great ass and uh this better by the way it's not like i loved 
[04:11:00]  her i just liked my cousin because her ass was terrific there was no love there or feelings that  would be almost nice i valued her as a person and that translated into sexual feelings no it was pure  lust what this is terrible how do i always dig myself into a hole like this  just one innocent little statement from my youth and i end up having to defend myself with a coroner 
[04:11:30]  named jimsy it's just horrid was this your song uh yeah have a song yeah this was it it's kind of  creepy man i'm from a really big family and we're all really good looking and uh  and i did i never had that thought you never and i even have everything and i even have a cousin that's  uh my cousin that's that's all that matters but there's no sharing of the blood she's adopted and 
[04:12:00]  even her oh please and she's beautiful no i i'd do an adopted sister are you kidding if she was hot  yeah yeah things like that like the brady bunch uh thing yeah you know if you had a marsha brady  yeah i mean if you had that be uh on that in a second but you never had a cousin that you  looked at and thought was attractive let's just say that i never said yeah see 
[04:12:30]  you never had a cousin that you looked at and said well there's a a pretty she's turning into a  pretty uh i'm not falling for your game i'm not i'm not gonna playing a game i'm just trying to  bring me into your your creepiness i'm really yes as a human being you could tell uh if someone is  good looking or not but that's very different than saying attractive attractive means there's  a little chemistry there well no no attractive means attractive it's did you ever have a female 
[04:13:00]  cousin that you looked at and said that's a pretty girl look at weddings we might play who's who's the  ugliest cousin and fun games like that but attractive no because that makes it creepy no it doesn't make  it creepy it makes it you're a guy looking at a girl and do you think now to distinguish an ugly  cousin from a pretty one you have to then know that one is pretty see you're using the word  attractive to try to get me into your creepy world yes do i live in creepy world yes you look up there 
[04:13:30]  look up uh the definition jimmy look up the definition of attractive see this yeah you're  using semantics i mean i'm not falling for that no i can tell if someone's good looking yes but that  doesn't mean i want to have sex with them or look at them as uh some kind of uh sex object you wouldn't  look at a cousin that had a nice ass and a good set on her and look and go wow that's attractive you  wouldn't you wouldn't notice it you wouldn't because i would say because you're a cousin i said you wouldn't 
[04:14:00]  even notice that she had a good ass on her yes something inside prevents you from going down all right  what it prevents you from going down that road i could look at one of my cousins go yeah she's  she's she's good look good look yeah there's something that prevents it but you are admitting  that you would notice that she if she had a nice body you're not winning this today i know you're  good at this crap but you're not winning barry what do you got and i can't i can't believe you picked 
[04:14:30]  up the panties and looked in on that so gross why like that was i wouldn't even pick up a supermodel's  panties man what's wrong with you yeah what are you doing no now you look at it like an idiot  no way panties panties give you the uh it gives you a closer feel to what is in them what goes in  them it really does perhaps you ever see like a stray maybe is in there like a stray got caught in 
[04:15:00]  there or or or you see uh some suspicious markings oh perhaps there were markings inside of it oh it  looked like she stopped suddenly on a line of cranberry sauce  wow sharing the laughs and love and opie and anthony family special well folks that's it we've heard a  lot of stories today of embarrassing family scenarios and seemingly unusual experiences with relatives
