<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion amongst Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton about Norton's sleep problems, blamed on late-night masturbation and screen time.  This segued into a morbid discussion about the 9/11 attacks, including a critique of a poorly-executed Mike Huckabee cartoon on the subject and a review of the documentary *Rebirth* about Ground Zero.  They then reviewed *Bridesmaids*, with Norton initially disliking it but ultimately finding humor in certain scenes.  A significant portion was dedicated to their negative experience at a screening of *What’s Your Number*, arranged by producer Roland, focusing on their disappointment with Joel McHale's limited screen time and their overall critique of the film's unbelievable premise.  This segment included calls from a listener using the "F.U. line" and a lengthy call from Dan from Cleveland, detailing his encounter with a faith healer who punched him in the face. The Indiana State Fair stage collapse (with a surprisingly low death toll) was also mentioned, leading to a transition to graphic sexual descriptions by one of the hosts.

The show continued with a caller, Dan, describing a photo of Michelle Bachmann seemingly eating a corn dog, prompting crude sexual commentary.  Political discussions followed, covering Obama's approval ratings, the Iowa straw poll, Mitt Romney, and taxation of the wealthy.  A substantial portion was devoted to racist and offensive commentary about Detroit, gun violence, and Black people, including insensitive "shooting tips" and discussions about drug dealing and racial dynamics. Multiple callers shared their experiences buying drugs in various NYC and Detroit neighborhoods, often with detailed and offensive descriptions, providing counterpoints to the hosts’ provocative generalizations.  This section included Bob Kelly and Penn Jillette being mentioned as upcoming guests, and ended with a repetitive song about anal sex.

Bob Kelly then joined the show as a guest, beginning with drunken ramblings before transitioning to a planned fly-fishing trip to Roscoe, New York, with Jim Serpico.  A large portion covered Kelly's Utah fly-fishing trip, including his fall into a river, injury, and discovery of large paw prints. This led to humorous exaggerations of a potential mountain lion attack and imagined stand-up routines.  The conversation shifted to the hosts' dislike of Kreskin, detailing negative experiences and anecdotes, including Kreskin's ejection from a Debbie Reynolds show at Penn Jillette's request.  This discussion included other magicians and mentalists,  skeptical investigations, and a disastrous seance for Steven Spielberg's bachelor party.

Penn & Teller joined as guests, focusing on Penn Jillette's skepticism towards John Edwards and his purported ability to communicate with the dead.  Jillette detailed his views on cold reading, pre-show questionnaires, and the exploitation of grieving individuals.  He contrasted this with his magic act and discussed anecdotes about John Edwards, including a cancelled 9/11-themed show. A caller, Kathy, defended Edwards, leading to a discussion about deception. Jillette promoted his book, "God No."  The segment included calls from Otto and further discussions on Siegfried & Roy, Uri Geller (with clips from the Johnny Carson show), and a caller's stand-up shows.  The show included comedic interjections, improvised riffs, and promotional plugs.

The final segment started with a graphic audio clip of Chip Chipperson engaging in explicit phone sex.  This led to a discussion of "The Bobo Dating Game," including eligibility concerns, payment arrangements (implied to be sponsored by Trojan), and Bobo's trustworthiness.  The hosts debated Bobo's Twitter activity, his ban from the show, and the removal of his angry tweets.  A listener-submitted song about "Good Boy Phone" was played, followed by a review of a video of Sam tasting Guy Fieri's steak, sparking a debate about Fieri's actions.  The show concluded with a recounting of a physical altercation between Roland and Troy Kwan (who was a guest in studio),  including audio of the incident and discussions of potential future pranks and revenge.

[00:00:00]  And now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony Show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hog, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, it's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're good.  America's America's most trusted name in the news, America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Ah, good morning.  My God.  Monday, Monday.  I'm very tired. 
[00:04:30]  I don't sleep.  Dude, I literally went to bed at like 1 and laid there until 5 and then showered.  What's wrong with you?  I just don't sleep.  Jimmy.  I slept late yesterday.  You're drinking coffee too late.  Yes.  You're probably treating yourself a little too late in the day with some sugary treats.  No sugar.  I did have coffee.  What time you have coffee?  When I woke up yesterday at like 4.45 p.m.  Wow, that shouldn't bother you sleeping.  And then I did jerk off last night. 
[00:05:00]  Someone told me that that kills your melatonin when you look at the screen too late at night.  Like your electronics, it hurts your melatonin production.  Well, how long were you looking at the screen?  It was a while.  Were you edging?  Jimmy was edging.  Just get it over with already.  He's the edge kid.  Just get it over with.  Yeah, just fucking.  You're right, man.  Just do a quickie.  Just fucking yank that roof.  Get rid of the poison and take a Napsky. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, man.  There's a whole world to see, Jimmy.  Stop the edging shit.  I have something that I've been obsessed about.  Oh, boy.  No, no, but you may not exist.  I've been waiting for this day.  It's not a bad thing.  Yeah, yes.  It's the 9-11 anniversary is coming up.  And I've been watching coming attractions.  They're showing there's going to be a Bush interview on Discovery.  And they're showing this computer graphic of one of the planes hitting the tower in slow motion.  Yeah.  And you can see it.  Have you seen it?  No.  It looks like it was done by a computer, like in absolute slow motion. 
[00:06:00]  And I've been obsessed with when the plane hit the building.  And I suppose it's too early for the subject.  But did the people, like how exactly, it sounds like a stupid question, but exactly what happened to them on that plane?  That would be instant fucking pulverization.  But I mean, was it, in that nanosecond, do you get, like did everyone get, like because of the stopping, like domino to the front of the plane?  Or do you have a moment of awareness when you're in the building?  Like I know it's a.  I think it's such a fast thing that it had to just, like you could think of it in slow motion, like a drop. 
[00:06:30]  You ever watch a drop of water in slow motion?  And all the subtle little things that happen.  Right.  But that's seeing it in slow motion.  Yeah.  At real speed, it was probably so fast, everything was ripped apart.  That plane literally disappeared.  When you see it hit, it's there.  Once the nose hits the building, it's fucking gone.  But to stop that quickly, like the G-force to stop, do you in that millionth of a second or whatever, does every chair just go forward and pancake? 
[00:07:00]  I mean, you're dead, of course, before you get to that.  I think before the chair would even hit the back of the other person's chair in front of you,  you're already so involved in the ripping apart and fire and everything else that that part wouldn't even matter anymore.  It's just such a fast.  I think in a millisecond, you're aware.  Yeah, that's what I was wondering.  Absolutely.  A few hundred miles an hour like that?  To stop in a one block. 
[00:07:30]  You're aware, but we don't go through our life that way.  So, I don't know.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  So, you don't, like maybe in that split second, like something's happening.  Oh, gee.  But they didn't suffer.  No, no, no.  I mean, it was the panic knowing.  Yeah, yeah.  What was about to go down.  But when it finally went down, they were dead instantly.  But I don't think that, of course, isn't it?  No, that's not the one.  I don't even know if it's online.  No, this is a cartoon that Mike Huckabee released. 
[00:08:00]  He said it was computer animated.  Yeah, but I mean, it's a really good one.  No, it's just a cartoon, Sam.  I'm not attacking you.  I'm just saying.  I'm attacking him.  I am.  I am.  You're dumb.  No, but this is good to check out, too, because Mike Huckabee releases educational 911 video  for kids.  Critics call profits blood money.  Well, whatever.  I don't know the whole story.  But it's so stupid to put this in cartoon form for kids.  Look, cartoons.  Oh, they got cartoon bin Laden.  You want to watch this?  It's bad animation.  It's just horrible. 
[00:08:30]  Learn history.  Yes.  Drive in America's path.  Look at that.  Cartoon.  How could it be bad?  It's a cartoon.  Yeah.  It was a day that changed America forever.  No!  Who would do something like this?  America was attacked by al-Qaeda, anti-American Muslim terrorists. 
[00:09:00]  Al-Qaeda is led by Osama bin Laden.  The time for jihad is upon us.  Death to the Americans.  Death to the Americans.  Death to the Americans.  But they never counted on America coming together like never before.  Wow.  Look at the police and firefighters.  They're right into the middle of it.  Some of the passengers learned about the other hijacked planes and decided to fight back.  And our leaders were determined to defeat terrorism.  So that's our plan.  Bring down the Taliban and al-Qaeda. 
[00:09:30]  The U.S. and its allies broke apart al-Qaeda and cut off bin Laden from his followers and his money.  The U.S. and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.  And ten years later, everyone's a fucking asshole. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  That was a moment, though.  I'm not a big Bush guy, but when he stood down there with that bullhorn, that's a fucking moment, man.  Everybody was all fucking rabid.  But you put it in cartoon form.  That doesn't seem bad at all.  Makes it look silly.  It does, right?  It's like watching Tom and Jerry.  It doesn't do it justice.  Everybody just walks out of the building looking like someone gave him an exploding cigar, you know?  Right, right.  Yeah.  I told Ann I saw Rebirth.  Did you get a copy of that? 
[00:10:30]  I think I did.  I didn't watch it.  I was reading.  That's the movie where Ted did his famous bit where he wants to take Polaroids.  Remember?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Rebirth is basically a movie where they've had cameras down at Ground Zero for the last nine-plus years.  And the movie's finally coming out.  It's been a project for the last nine and a half, well, ten years, obviously, when it's finally released.  And they follow like six or seven people that were affected by 9-11.  Pretty good movie. 
[00:11:00]  I'll watch it.  It's coming out soon.  I'm surprised.  What happened?  I never had it.  Hmm?  All the weekends.  I saw it.  I saw it.  Oh, you saw it?  I saw it.  I saw a bridesmaid.  Whoa.  Over the weekend.  Whoa.  Bridesmaid.  Whoa.  Bridesmaid.  Whoa.  All right.  We're going to talk about 9-11 another day.  But rebirth is...  This is actually more tragic, what he just said. 
[00:11:30]  I don't know what to say about rebirth because I want people to see it, obviously.  Yeah.  I'll watch it.  It shows ground zero being reborn, obviously, and you see everything being put back together  down there.  And you also see the people's lives that were affected by 9-11 being put back together, slowly  but surely.  Yeah.  And I told Anthony, you know, you think after you die, if you're the one that goes first  that, you know, your loved one will just mourn you forever.  The fact is, they'll just move on. 
[00:12:00]  That's what I learned from this movie.  Yeah.  They'll move on.  They'll fall in love with someone else, have more kids.  Just...  It's just...  You're just a distant memory.  You know how...  Rachel Ucattel.  Huh?  Rachel Ucattel is an example.  Yeah.  Well, you know that time heals all wounds.  So they say, right?  And then you fall in love with someone else and you get married on a beach in Hawaii and  then you end up having a couple of kids.  But, you know, but you lost your fiancé on 9-11.  And it was very tragic for you. 
[00:12:30]  But do you imagine, like, Rachel Ucattel's fiancé, right?  Like, they were going to get married or whatever.  Yeah.  And he died on 9-11.  But it's weird how, like, you can never know how the movie's going to turn out.  Like, he would never have believed you if you told him one day while he was watching  TV, because you know he had watched TV with her and seen Tiger Woods on TV.  Right.  That someday she would be famous for fucking him and getting $10 million.  Yeah.  Like, that guy could not in his entire life imagine that scenario happening.  No.  Bet not. 
[00:13:00]  That she would be a household name.  Yeah.  Because of fucking that golfer.  I guess...  Oh, this is the trailer?  Projectrebirth.org if you want to check out the trailer for Rebirth.  But, yeah, that woman, she ends up moving on.  I guess I spoiled a little bit, but...  Well, I figure they do.  They have to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, but...  It was a pretty cool movie.  Ten years.  Huh?  Ten fucking years.  Right around the corner, less than a month away at this point.  Does it seem like ten years?  No. 
[00:13:30]  No.  Blink of an eye, man.  Not at all.  Blink of a fucking eye.  When we got back to radio, it was only three years.  It's just because it was such a...  Yeah.  Jesus.  It's just because it was such a memorable thing, you know?  You remember every split second of it.  It's not like a ten-year-old memory of fucking, you know, seeing a movie or fucking driving  to the store, you know?  It was like, okay, I remember every fucking nanosecond of that day. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  So, it makes it seem like it wasn't ten years ago.  When does Rebirth come out?  There's screenings...  Now?  Yeah, August 6th tomorrow is the first screening that they have listed.  That's Friday night.  All right, people are going to start checking out this movie then.  East Hampton and then theatrical release in Boston.  East Hampton?  That's where they're starting this?  August 26th.  They're going to hoity-toity East Hampton for this big 9-11 Rebirth movie? 
[00:14:30]  The premiere.  Yeah, and then they're doing L.A. and then New York and then D.C.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  That'll find its audience, you know?  A lot of people interested in what happened in the past ten years to people and Ground Zero.  Yeah.  Bridesmaid.  What?  Yeah.  I begged you to see this dumb movie.  Yeah.  Well, my chick was watching it, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Sure.  Um... 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, it's never you.  Yeah.  No, it's never me.  Of course not.  Yeah, what were you doing?  Lifting weights?  Boxing?  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  Cool shit like that.  Cigars?  Cool manly things.  But I catch, like...  Here and there?  A couple of minutes of it in a row.  Mm-hmm.  And I realized within that five-minute period, I probably laughed, like, three times.  Uh-oh.  Like, and I'm like, what the fuck?  Oh, fuck.  Like, like...  And then I'm watching it, and there was some legitimately funny fucking parts in it. 
[00:15:30]  I gotta apologize to Roland.  It was a chick flick.  How much of the movie did you see?  I saw the whole thing.  Oh.  You went back and started over?  Yeah, I figured I would, you know, catch the whole thing, and aside from the, you know,  the sappy, completely predictable ending, which was total chick flick ending, there 
[00:16:00]  was some, you know, there was some laughs in it.  What am I gonna say?  Am I gonna lie to protect my fucking testicles and manly hood?  I mean, in all fairness, the movie got 90% positive reviews from reviewers, and 82% of  the audience loved this movie.  I just fucking didn't like it, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I like the fat bitch.  Which one?  The fat... 
[00:16:30]  The ugly one.  Oh, the ugly...  Yeah, yeah, the friend.  Oh, because the English fat bitch was pretty funny.  Oh, yeah, she was alright.  With the infected tattoo.  Fuck, maybe I should go back and see this goddamn movie again.  I found it, Britt, we're inviting you to not live with us anymore.  Are you coming over tonight?  I have big news.  I see the trailer's gonna be real bad, I bet.  I'm engaged.  What?  Will you be my maid of honor?  Of course.  You'll love the rest of the bridesmaids. 
[00:17:00]  I'd be more than happy to handle the bachelorette in the shower.  I think I can handle it.  Annie, what is this place?  I know it looks a little scary on the outside.  The food here is really, really good.  Oh, look, you can get a check cash next door.  Come on.  Helen, aren't you having any meat?  It's good to eat a big meal before a fitting.  This is some classy shit.  I want to apologize.  I'm not even confident of which end that came out of.  That's the first laugh.  You got food poisoning from that restaurant.  No.  Everybody, go outside. 
[00:17:30]  Be careful.  We all got the food.  That was very funny right there.  Can you pause that?  Just a witness.  That was a fucking fat girl running across the street, and she falls on her stomach.  It's slapstick.  But again, that made me laugh.  That's not a fat chick, by the way.  Oh, it's a regular girl?  It was really in a bride's dress, and she fell in front of a car.  Can I see that again?  That was a great fall.  She was shitting herself in the bride's dress in the middle of the room.  No.  Everybody, go outside.  Be careful.  We all got the flu. 
[00:18:00]  Were they a flu poisoning?  Yeah.  All right.  Don't blow it.  I'll watch it now.  I feel like her life is going off and getting perfect, and mine's just like...  I need you to touch your nose with your finger.  If I was drunk, would I be able to do this?  I would hope so.  I was gonna leave you till you did that.  I wanted to come over some ideas for the bachelorette party.  I was thinking Las Vegas.  Strip club.  Disney World.  Fight club.  Go to a fight club?  No, we're not gonna go to a fight club.  Oh, okay.  We're gonna be the fight club. 
[00:18:30]  Vegas it is.  I'm a nervous flyer, I'm sorry.  I had a dream last night that we went down.  You were in it.  What?  You should just toss it back.  I'm ready to party!  Pause this.  You're like the maid of Dishonor.  The trailer...  This trailer sucks.  The trailer is...  Because there are laughs in the movie.  Yeah.  There was one laugh so far.  And the slapstick thing.  So two laughs.  That was very funny.  Yeah, yeah.  They're just...  They're putting it together like... 
[00:19:00]  I guess it's very hard to put a trailer together for something that's kind of story-based  and something like that.  All right, let's go.  Let's see if there's another laugh.  All the funny parts in a trailer.  What do you get?  Because you'll notice as this is playing, I've taken the lid off of my coffee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take this huge step, and I'm going to be there right next to you.  I am dead serious.  Dead serious.  Will you marry me? 
[00:19:30]  Yes.  Do you have a date for the wedding?  Because I have a great guy for you.  I'm going to just hang down here with my son Tyler and be back in a minute.  Sure.  Did you eat one of those?  I ate Saturday.  I don't even think that was in the movie that I see.  I don't remember saying that.  It doesn't look bad.  Huh?  Honestly, it doesn't look bad.  We didn't laugh.  Nah, but it doesn't matter.  We laughed at two little things.  Because I know what the trailer...  Trailers really are out-of-context moments, and slapstick to me is one of the only things 
[00:20:00]  that works out-of-context.  Yeah.  It's always funny to see somebody in a bride's dress falling in front of a moving vehicle.  Yeah.  But lines aren't necessarily funny out of context.  Wow, instant feedback.  A lot of people liked Bridesmaids, and Anthony liked it.  Maybe I was just in a bad mood or something.  I got to try it again, I guess.  There was some laughs in it.  Like I said, the end, completely predictable rom-com-y dribble kind of stuff.  You know, oh boy, everything works out.  But, yeah.  I did find myself going like, fuck, that was pretty goddamn funny. 
[00:20:30]  Fair enough.  Yeah, pretty funny.  I like the fat bitch.  Yeah, yeah.  She had some Chris Farley in her.  Pretty fucking hilarious.  The first fucking time you see her on screen, you're like, yeah, the pins.  I got pins in my leg.  Right.  Fell off a cruise ship.  That fucking...  That shit was funny.  All right.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Me and Jimmy got to see a movie on Friday.  Oh.  How was that?  We could talk about this, Jimmy. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Because Roland fucked us over.  Is Roland in yet?  I don't think so.  Roland goes...  Roland tells me and Jimmy, hey, man, Joel McHale's coming in soon, and he's promoting Spy Kids 4, I believe, right?  But he has another movie coming out on September 30th.  What was the name of the movie?  That we saw?  I'll give you a hundred bucks if you know.  I don't know.  Wait a minute.  Let me think.  We just saw it Friday. 
[00:21:30]  Let me think.  A hundred dollars.  Oh.  We just saw this movie.  What's the name of it?  Oh, God.  Come on.  What's your number?  What's your number?  What's your number?  Yes.  Did you look on the screen?  Yes, I did.  Okay.  Thank God.  I really didn't feel like it.  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  So I still don't know if that's what it is until you said you confirmed.  I think we could save face with everybody, but Roland gets a beating today, because Roland 
[00:22:00]  goes, hey, you guys mind seeing Joel McHale's movies coming in soon?  So me and Jimmy are like, all right.  Yeah.  And we're like, how long is the movie?  He goes, an hour and a half tops.  By the way, the movie was almost two hours.  Oh.  So that's the first thing.  That's a big difference.  We go because Joel McHale's a friend of the show, and he's coming in.  We love Joel McHale, right?  Yeah.  Joel McHale is in this movie for maybe seven minutes.  It's not Joel McHale's movie.  Oh, no.  The part he plays in the movie is really funny. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  But it's not his fucking movie.  He's not even in the movie for the last hour and a half of the movie.  It is a cameo.  It's a cameo.  Holy shit.  So on a Friday when we could have started our weekend, we're like, okay, let's do the  right thing.  Joel's coming in.  We'll go see this movie.  Sure.  No problem, Roland.  Roland goes with us.  Nice little screening room.  Did he fall asleep?  No.  But we sat there like, you got to be shitting me.  Yeah.  It's a good movie, but it's a rom-com, and there was no reason to see it. 
[00:23:00]  You know Chris Evans, who's Captain America?  Yeah.  He's in this movie, but I'm certain he's not coming back to promote it.  Because he made this movie before Captain America, and Anna Faris is in it, and she's  really funny.  I didn't love the movie at all.  I thought Joel was very funny.  His cameo was great.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I thought he was going to be the focus of the whole movie.  I just didn't buy.  The basic premise of the movie is that Anna Faris, her character finds out that her friends, 
[00:23:30]  that she's fucked almost 20 guys.  Right.  And she freaks out about that number, and she wants to make the next guy she fucks her  husband.  So she does something stupid, and then she realizes she has to go over and find ex-boyfriends,  and try to hook up with one of them to marry, maybe.  And then she gets Chris Evans to help her, who's like the neighbor across the hall who  fucks a lot of girls, but he decides to buddy up and help her.  And it was almost like, and she's like, oh my god, you sleep with so many women like 
[00:24:00]  that type.  And it's almost like, are you going to tell me a five like Anna Faris isn't going to  fuck an 11 like Chris Evans?  He fucking, the first scene, he opens the door and he's naked, he's holding a newspaper  in front of his penis.  I actually went, oh.  Fucking Jimmy.  That son of a bitch is in good shape.  But I just found the premise to be very, very hard to buy.  Yeah.  I do think she's funny though, and I like Chris Evans. 
[00:24:30]  It's almost like I tweeted, I liked everybody in the movie, but I just didn't buy it.  No, it's going to be a good rom-com.  Oh, I'm sorry, and Tim from The Office was in it.  Right.  But my point is that there was no reason for us to see this movie.  So now was Joel McHale just kind of one of the guys that she meets?  And she gets, this isn't giving much away because it's the first five minutes of the movie,  she gets fired.  And Joel McHale is her boss.  Yeah, okay.  And they hook up in a bar, and he likes to smell his fingers a lot after he's with girls. 
[00:25:00]  He's always smelling his fingers, smelling the back of his hands.  It was really funny.  So then you're thinking, okay, he's going to be obviously a big part of this movie  because Roland told us it's a Joel McHale movie.  All of a sudden she says goodbye to him, you know, because she slept with him, whatever.  And then he's gone.  That was it for him.  That was it for him.  So I would really like to know, Roland, why we had to go see this movie.  And it was in an hour and a half.  And me and Jimmy, we're cracking each other up.  Yeah, because we were all sitting in our own row.  And I actually went to the bathroom at one point and just didn't return. 
[00:25:30]  But he just kept, like, I wasn't, because there was a security guard in there.  They make sure you don't film.  Yeah.  And there was a guy in the back.  I didn't know if he was attached to the film.  But a few times I was just going, like, ugh.  And, you know, and Chip was making noises.  And then I just kept looking back, like, should I?  And he starts going, this is terrible.  This is terrible.  Well, what was terrible was, like, it was obvious shit you see in rom-coms. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Where the girls are getting together and getting a little edgy.  You know, just stuff like that.  That made me laugh.  Maybe rom-com fans might like it.  And then there was, they had the, that black guy is at every screening I go to.  He's the making sure you don't pirate the movie guy aunt.  Yeah.  That's an ideal location to do it.  And he has all these, like, this binocular type thing.  And he's just staring at me and Jimmy and Roland, making sure we're not pulling anything out of our, you know, I guess they can pick up the electronics or whatever.  And I wanted to so bad, just go, trust me, I'm not making a copy of this fucking movie. 
[00:26:30]  Go home.  No one's filming this, mister.  And then at one point, like Jimmy said, he gets up, he goes, I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm like, you son of a bitch.  You knew I was going?  You son of a bitch.  And he never came back.  He knew I was gone.  Yeah.  My problem is, if I start a movie, I gotta fucking sit through it.  I don't know what that's about.  Sometimes I do.  There's only been probably three movies I've stopped watching, walked out on, whatever.  I walked out of Cool World.  I think that was the one. 
[00:27:00]  That's a bad one.  That was the only one I ever walked out of in my entire life.  I always sit through even bad movies.  But this wasn't a...  I walked out of Mr. Mike's Mondo video.  Oh, boy.  That was terrible.  But in all fairness, because now Roland's going to be like, oh, fuck, guys, you're killing me.  You didn't kill the movie.  It's a good rom-com.  But the point, once again, there was no reason for me and Jimmy to fucking spend our, you  know, Friday.  We promote this movie because he's only in it for seven minutes. 
[00:27:30]  So what's he going to promote?  He's promoting Spy Kids 4.  Oh, 4D.  4D.  How do they do 4D?  There's some, I think, aromascope is what they're calling it.  Some kind of smell-o-vision added.  I saw the poster in the theater over the weekend.  So it's 3D with stink?  Yeah, it's some kind of smell-o-vision.  How do they do that?  I don't know.  I just saw the poster for it.  They pump an aerosol into the fucking theater?  Or maybe they give you...  I remember Family Matters had a smell-o-vision episode. 
[00:28:00]  Scratch and sniff card?  Yeah, you get a card from 7-Eleven or someplace and you got to scratch and sniff and Urkel tells  you when to scratch the card.  Is this FDA approved?  Yeah, oh yeah, I did it.  What a dork.  You stink.  Is this FDA approved?  I can't confirm or deny.  Uh-huh.  So, yeah.  Roland's not in yet?  Not yet.  He's on his way, but he's not on.  I want him to defend the fact that he forced me and Jimmy to go to this thing.  No, no, it was just, it's just, they want a screen. 
[00:28:30]  I was just, if you want to go, it's, you know, it's, I hope he's not in yet because  he's having a fucking Robert Shaw on the third rail moment.  Fuck, he ain't like Pridesmaids.  Fuck.  You know, what are you going to do?  Pridesmaids.  Hilarious.  Sometimes I get taken by surprise.  Fair.  Some of these movies.  I know.  You know how it is.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, well, since we had our fucking great, great weekend of weather, it was just a lot 
[00:29:00]  of sitting around watching movies.  You didn't go see The Help?  No.  I heard that was a very, very big movie, though, this weekend, huh?  Number two, 25 million.  What's The Help about?  I know it's Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce.  Is it?  Yeah.  She's going to look at.  It takes place in the 50s.  Wow, between Rise of the Planet of the Apes and The Help, it's a lot.  So, I'm just saying a lot of money brought in.  You know.  Planet of the Apes, number one again?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And what's The Help about?  That was a biggie.  It's about a girl in Mississippi who gets the point of view from the maids that are working  for their, the colored women working for their white bosses as help in, like, the 50s  and exposes the world to racism.  What?  Great.  You want to see the trailer?  Better than the polio vaccine, if you ask me.  I wanted to see the, I wanted to see the trailer of the movie Me and Jimmy Saw on Friday. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, I just wanted to see.  I want to see if there's any laughs in the trailer.  And Chris Evans, I just, he was good.  He was very good, but I just didn't laugh.  I was thinking that maybe you'd want to be my date to my sister's wedding.  Your parents can be?  At my sister's wedding?  I think so.  It just feels a little serious.  That's me.  What was it right there?  Oh, my God.  That was one of the, that was one of the best lines.  This is the movie.  And they, they cut it right there.  She sleeps with this dude, right?  She's been sleeping with him off and on.  So she invites him to the wedding. 
[00:30:30]  And he's basically saying, are your parents going to be there?  And she's like, yeah.  And he goes, well, it seems a little serious.  And then Anna Faris goes, well, it seemed a little serious when your dick was in my vagina  last night.  No.  Or something like that.  What she said, and this is what annoyed me, she said that she's like, it seemed kind  of serious when you were doing me from behind.  Yeah, yeah.  And I was annoyed that she said doing me instead of fucking me.  Right.  Like, even though I know that might change the rating.  And, but it was, it almost felt like, eh, he could have said fuck in there.  It still worked as a good line, but they blow it off and don't have it in the trailer. 
[00:31:00]  That's me.  Before you judge me, you have to realize my dating life hasn't exactly been stellar.  I locked myself out of my apartment.  Do you mind if I use your phone?  When every guy you run into seems to be on the run.  Do you think the woman coming out of your apartment could have helped you with a being  locked out problem?  I look at it as trying to avoid hurt feelings.  It's time to face the facts.  How many relationships do I have to have before I meet the right guy?  In America, 96% of women who have been with 20 or more lovers can't find a husband. 
[00:31:30]  20?  That seems very high.  No, it's low.  I am not going to sleep with one more guy until I am sure he's the one.  That's disgusting, Donald.  I dated him.  Donald?  Who is you?  This is my fiance, Cara.  She's a rocket scientist.  I'm marrying a scientist, too.  He doesn't look smart, either.  Is it possible that all my exes got better with time?  Okay, you help me track down my exes.  I'll help you escape yours.  You got a deal.  What about Jerry Perry? 
[00:32:00]  He's a puppeteer, so he's single.  You should give me your number.  We should catch up.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, babe.  Hey, you're looking good.  You know what?  I think I'm all caught up.  Oh, guys.  What about Simon for kissing?  Ali, it's brilliant to see it.  Simon, I can't believe it.  This is Colin, but he has to go now.  No, I don't.  What happened?  That scene wasn't as bad.  It was rusty, and I went full Borat.  So, we go dancing?  Huh? 
[00:32:30]  How about some dinner tonight?  Are you checking down all your ex-boyfriends so you don't go over 20?  I'll stop as soon as I fall in love.  Wow.  I wouldn't have known I was gay if I hadn't dated you.  Black guy.  Oh, yeah.  Pause right there.  That, to me, was the funniest thing.  Jimmy laughed out loud at that point.  I laughed out loud.  There was a thing he did about how gay he was, and it made me laugh out loud.  Just say it.  LOL.  No, it's a visual.  He said something about, I'm really gay. 
[00:33:00]  Like, I'm one here, one there, one here, one here gay.  Like, mimicking he had a dick in his ass mouth and one in his hand.  Like, it was one here, one there, and a couple of here gay.  It was so fucking funny, man.  He had a lot of dicks around him.  This guy had a lot of dicks.  He liked a lot of dicks.  But he was telling her that he's a flaming homosexual.  That moment made me laugh very hard.  And it was very funny, man.  Yeah.  It really was.  I was gay if I hadn't dated you.  Oh, yeah.  I feel like everyone else is moving on with their lives but me. 
[00:33:30]  How do you know what you want?  You don't know who you are.  I have to go to my sister's wedding alone.  I'll go with it.  You want to do that?  Yeah.  Sometimes you can't live life by the numbers.  You have to figure it out as you go along.  I know that I'm not perfect.  She's on a dress.  She fell.  I want to be with somebody who appreciates me.  Barrett?  It's Allie.  Oh, doesn't ring a bell.  We dated?  We're a gynecologist.  Oh.  Let's see how things are going now.  And he looks at her pussy. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  Allie.  Of course.  What's your name?  I didn't recognize the pussy.  Yeah.  I mean, like, all of a sudden, he doesn't know her.  But then he recognizes her as soon as he gets down there and sees her pussy.  I just didn't buy it, though.  Like, you know, I like Chris.  I like her.  Jimmy Bryan in Washington, D.C.  They fall in love in the end, right?  I'm not going to fucking tell you.  And I couldn't.  Never.  Because by the time that ended, I had one finger in my belly button and one wrapped around 
[00:34:30]  my dick.  And I was tug, tug, tugging away.  Look, I'll say it again, because I know Rowan's going to panic.  It's a good rom-com for rom-commers.  Rom-commers.  But there was no reason for me and Jimmy to fucking spend, you know, on Friday after the  show, 30 seconds watching this.  Anna Faris was good to look at.  She was semi-nude a lot in this movie.  I would definitely bang Anna Faris.  She's got a nice dumper.  Compared to Chris Evans, I don't buy that she's not going to.  A woman like that is not going to not want to bang that guy across the hall. 
[00:35:00]  There was another way they could have got into the premise, I thought, where it turned  out her sister in the movie was getting married to her ex-boyfriend.  So they could have just used that and said, hey, you found your ex.  My boyfriends have all been losers, I thought.  But I'm going to go back and try to find an ex.  It would have been more believable than fucking the numbers thing.  It's amazing.  I'm trying to say why a rom-com didn't have the integrity of fucking a platoon.  Yes, Jimmy.  Let me say hi to Dan in Cleveland.  Dan?  Hey, what's up? 
[00:35:30]  Dan the man.  Hey, how you guys doing?  I'm the same asshole that sounded like Elmue Fudd.  I was just calling to say that you guys told me this movie a new asshole like two months  ago when you saw the trailer.  What?  Oh, we saw the trailer for it and we killed it?  You talked shit about it massively.  You said it's another one of these shitty romance comedies.  Just another rom-com.  On and on and on.  A rom-com.  A rom-com, yes, indeed. 
[00:36:00]  I understand.  Everybody does.  That's the thing.  You talk funny.  I do.  Waskily.  I talk like a waskily.  Waskily.  It was just a rom-com.  We told you.  Put some silly putty in the roof of your mouth and you'll talk pretty much better.  I could listen to you talk about anything, dude.  Oh, I know.  Dan, do you understand?  All I want to do is listen to you.  You rule.  Jimmy, that means a lot to me.  It means a lot to him. 
[00:36:30]  That's very funny.  I don't want to do a great question to my comically ridiculous voice.  That's a funny thing.  I don't hear it.  When I hear myself talk, I sound like everybody else.  But if I hear myself on tape, I'm fucking, oh my God.  Do you want to put a bullet in your head?  So how old were you when you first realized that you spoke a little differently?  Was it basically when you said mama, dada and heard raucous laughter? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Also, it's coupled with this thing.  I'm so fucking loud in person.  I'm so obnoxiously loud.  It's unbelievable.  Have you ever had a fight over anybody saying anything rude?  Oh, not really, no.  Not any fistfights or anything.  Nothing since elementary school.  That means you're a big guy.  Yeah, I am kind of.  You can take care of yourself. 
[00:37:30]  I'm sorry, go ahead.  I went back shit crazy from bipolar disorder.  Oh.  And I haven't really done anything.  Bipolar?  Yeah, bipolar.  Do you at least address it when you talk to people?  How do you address it if you know that they're hearing it?  I just do it the same way I did with you guys.  As soon as I realize somebody knows what's up with it, I go, yeah.  I have a stupid dog-shaped mouth that is a fucking birth defect.  Dog-shaped mouth.  Dog-shaped mouth.  You're funny, brother.  But that's cool.  I bet you when you address it, it actually probably makes it a little bit better. 
[00:38:00]  And people are like, oh, okay, because I kind of noticed that.  It's not that weird.  Yeah, it does.  It cuts it down a little bit, yeah, when I take it right to the forefront and kind of own it.  What about with girls?  You know, it kind of comes and goes.  It helps and then it doesn't sometimes.  Some girls think, you know, I've actually, I've been told on and on and on, I should just  tell people it's like an exotic accent from some part of Europe where they talk English  but funny.  Europe.  Wow.  You sound like you're eating pussy right now.  Yeah, you know.  Just dog mouth.  Just mush that mouth up against the vagina. 
[00:38:30]  The women will love that.  There you go.  Big time tongue, too, I guess, the last time.  Big time tongue.  Does Al Pacino have that?  Al Pacino has a weird thing with his R's and he's always had that.  Yeah.  If he's like, it's very subtle.  He's like, something's really wrong here today.  There's a little bit of that Pacino has.  Yeah, yeah, a little bit.  You're right.  Yeah, you never know.  He might have something like that.  It can be better and worse.  And you can, like I said, you can go to speech therapy and you can put better or less effort 
[00:39:00]  into it, you know.  Way to go, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Compare Dan from Cleveland to Al Pacino, who is a billionaire for making movies in Hollywood.  Right.  Yeah, I'm a bipolar.  Dan's just like Al Pacino.  I'm jobless.  I'm 24.  Yeah, exactly.  And yeah, I haven't been in college and all I do is smoke dope.  I got lifts.  I should have put them under my tongue.  By the way, the funniest thing that would happen, though, in regards to my voice, my 
[00:39:30]  mom took me to a faith healer guy in Ohio, Ernest Angeli, when my dad went crazy.  And the guy fucking punched me in the face and knocked me out when I was like eight years  old.  Why?  Because he was going to heal my voice with his magic powers.  Wait, he punched you to try to heal you?  Well, he punched me with like the heel of his hand.  You know what I mean?  You know how those guys do?  They go like, Jesus, and then they fucking give it to you.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  There is a videotape somewhere because they showed it. 
[00:40:00]  It's Ernest Angeli, the TV show.  I don't know.  I wouldn't know how to find it, but they had a TV show every like Friday and Sunday night.  And yeah, so I got wowed up in the head.  It was ridiculous.  Because I got tricked into going in the first place because I got told it was a buffet.  Hold on.  Your phone got cut out.  You got what in the head?  I got hit.  In the head.  That was a rough one, Dan.  To fix my dummy voice.  Wow up.  Dan.  You got wow up in the head. 
[00:40:30]  People could learn from you, brother.  You just own it.  Fuck it.  You just own it.  To fix my dummy voice.  Dan is just owning it.  My dummy voice.  I got tricked into going.  Well, my mom told me it was a buffet.  Buffet.  So, is he like a preacher?  One of those healers?  Faith healers?  Yeah.  He's like, he's mainly one of the guys that just, he goes on like TV at 10 o'clock.  I'm like, the show, the channel is not even UPN.  And then he goes, well, UPN, nothing's UPN anymore.  Fuck. 
[00:41:00]  But anyway, so he's the guy that's on the shitty 8th network.  And he would be, you know, at 11 o'clock or 10 o'clock at night.  And then they had him on in the morning eventually.  But he would just do healing shit.  And then he'd just talk, you know, and do various Jesus stuff.  And he'd hit people.  There was a woman there that was quote unquote possessed when I was there.  It was crazy shit.  How big a guy are you, Dan?  Like 5'11".  And I've been as big as like 240.  Okay.  And a good amount of muscle.  But now I'm like down to like 200 because I've just been fucking atrophying since high school. 
[00:41:30]  I went batshit crazy my senior year and ended up dropping out.  Can you, now let me ask you, is there a surgery they could do?  There's nothing they could do like to lower the roof of your mouth or put a full?  I don't think so.  I bet, well, you know, they could probably put some kind of fucking silicone implant in there.  Who knows?  You know, but I don't fucking know.  Nah, you don't need it.  I'm not too worried about that.  Nah, it seems like you're not.  Give me personality.  What?  What?  What's this guy's name again, Ernest?  Personality.  Ernest Angeli.  Look him up online. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, we're looking him up right now.  He looks like a fucking creep.  We just got distracted because Wohan just came in.  Wohan.  Wohan.  He took over.  New York Jets, Jets.  He took over the cathedral up here that was, I forgot what the guy's name was, but he was building  this monument in front of it.  I don't remember what the guy's name was who was doing it, but he was one of these televangelists.  And he was building it.  It was called the Lexus Election because it was like a big thing, like the Washington  Monument, you know?  And it never got finished because the guy got bankrupt and he was in some scandal. 
[00:42:30]  God, he loves to talk.  Holy shit, Dan.  Well, I'm bipolar.  I'm crazy.  We're not talking.  Look at this guy, though.  He has a horrible hairpiece.  You want to hear what this guy sounds like?  All right, this is the guy that punched you in the face, Dan, to try to solve your voice  problem.  Basically, he punched his forehead pretty much.  Forehead and palm of hand.  Like, like, uh, curl in your fingers and then, like, do like a, like a, uh, judo chop punch  kind of thing straight ahead. 
[00:43:00]  He did one of those.  Are you saved?  Oh, yes.  Don't smoke or drink.  No, I don't.  I have the glory of the Lord in the vision.  God's moving for your spine, your back, the vertebraes, the disc.  In the name of the Lord.  In the name of the Lord.  This is not a healing.  This is a miracle.  This is a miracle.  Ben, twist.  Do anything you want to do.  Okay.  Wow, that's right.  Wow. 
[00:43:30]  Do anything.  Do something you couldn't do in comfort.  You got a miracle.  Didn't you?  Did you get it?  Believe it.  You believe it.  You feel different now?  It's much better.  Oh, good.  Asshole.  Fucking asshole.  I want him to teach me a spell.  Yeah.  Ernest Angley rules.  God, has he got a...  He's the most un-fucking-inspirational preacher of her.  No care, man.  I wasn't inspired. 
[00:44:00]  What, Dan?  He is awful.  You know what?  He's terrible.  That didn't help you.  Hold on.  Someone might have found you on Twitter.  Let me see here.  I am on a dwill2168.  Oh, it's a...  Never mind.  It's a Life of Brian clip.  Oh.  He's losing anything at all.  That's too long.  All right.  Well, Dan, you rule.  All right.  Nice talking to you guys.  All right.  See you later, man.  Have a good day.  And thanks.  Bye.  Take care.  All right.  Call back soon, buddy. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, sure.  Yeah, you know.  Now and again.  Bye.  Bye.  Roll it.  You shouldn't be allowed to use a phone.  Now, let me preface this by saying I'm not mad at you, because I know you have the potential  to tear our fucking heads off our bodies.  But me and Jimmy want to know why we had to go to the movie Friday.  And Chip, you mean, throughout the whole movie?  Huh?  And Chip.  And Chip, yeah.  Did you hear Chip?  Oh, I heard him.  Um, no, because he was in that movie.  They never told me how long he was. 
[00:45:00]  It was a different company saying Joel's in this movie.  Joe McHale is in that movie for seven minutes tops.  I think I'm being kind.  I think it's less than five minutes.  Yeah, see that.  I did not know.  They say, it's a Joel.  Joel McHale's in the movie.  We'll love for you to see this movie.  I'm like, all right.  Did you like the movie?  I loved it.  It's a rom-com.  No, I told Jimmy, as far as rom-coms go, it'll find its audience.  But we're not rom-com guys.  We thought we'd go because Joel McHale was coming in.  But he's not really in this movie.  I didn't know that he's only in it.  Like, he's not going to promote this movie all over TV and stuff. 
[00:45:30]  Well, I didn't realize he was only in it for five minutes.  If that was a case, I would just want it by myself.  Yeah.  Oh, you should have.  Would you see it again?  Yeah, yeah.  What do you like about it?  It's just like the perfect rom-com.  No, what do you like about it?  It's just a perfect rom-com.  What do you say there?  I don't know.  I'm making it up.  I don't know.  Why'd you like it?  Yeah, you're crazy.  Was Chris Evans good?  Yeah, no, I just liked it.  It was just a funny romantic comedy movie.  No, that's all.  That could be any rom-com. 
[00:46:00]  Right.  Why did you like this particular rom-com?  What makes this a little, huh?  Made me laugh.  No, it's called general info.  Like, Hans said Bridesmaid, and he had specifics why he liked the movie.  Oh, yeah.  Why did you like...  Oh, yeah.  He goes, oh, yay.  Why did you like this rom-com?  Not broad strokes.  And I watched it.  You didn't fall asleep.  So you saw what we saw.  Yeah, I thought, I mean, Joel was funny in the movie, smelling his fingers. 
[00:46:30]  I went, oh, that's funny.  What else?  What else?  Oh, Jesus.  Anna Faris, she looked hot at some points, and then you go, oh, other points.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  It's just a good movie.  Go see it.  He's incapable.  We do radio.  You've got to paint the picture for the people.  Did you like that she would have a lot of conversations with Chris Evan when he was at the top of the steps looking down, 
[00:47:00]  and she was walking up the winding staircase?  You didn't wonder how the fuck does he know when she's coming home?  Why doesn't he just knock on his door?  Or maybe she'd text him.  I don't know.  No, I never thought about that.  Oh, Spectro.  Explain it.  Thank you, Spectro.  We don't need you anymore, Roland.  Spectro from Michigan writes, it has ROM and it has COM.  Yes.  There's some ROM and then some COM.  Do you remember these movies after you see them, Roland? 
[00:47:30]  Like a gold piece?  He says no as he leaves.  All right, fuck it.  All right, we, uh, here's a break.  Yeah, we'll eat something.  Yeah, I know you're not a big basketball fan, but Dennis Rodman broke down as he was inducted into the Hall of Fame.  Did he?  Mm-hmm.  Did he talk about his two bad knees?  Uh, yeah, pretty much his two bad knees and other things.  Yeah?  We got the Indian Elvis Presley.  Did a dream come true for him at some point?  19 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees. 
[00:48:00]  Very bad.  Oh, boy.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  I wonder what happened.  Think that worked out for him?  I don't know.  I hope so.  I beg God, the dream came true.  Oh.  Came true.  If you met him, would you mention that if we interviewed him?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:48:30]  You'd have to.  Oh, absolutely.  He would take a swing at you, though.  He's a tough guy.  I don't know.  He might laugh it off.  Schmitty would fucking take a swipe at you.  Yeah, he's like a tough Ohio fucking middle of the country fucking tough guy.  Don't bring up my pussy moment.  Oh, yeah.  He'll take a shot at you.  Meow.  Got to talk about the Indiana State Fair.  We were just talking about state fairs and how awful they are.  Yeah.  Well, that was a real awful one.  People are dying in Indiana and Detroit.  Yeah, for different reasons, though.  Oh, I know.  We'll explain after the break. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, there's...  Oh.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Hi.  I'm Radio's Daniel Bovo Carlin.  You know me from the Opie and Anthony show, Linger Longer.  I'm here to talk about bullying.  When I was in school, I was picked on, teased, spat upon, tormented, beaded, raped, belligered,  very much disliked, and made to feel less than.  But take it from me, it gets better. 
[00:49:30]  Since high school, I've become an international radio star.  I've met my heroes.  I've exposed my horribly disfigured genitalia with some of the greatest comics in the world.  I've been called stupid by millions of people in the United States and Canada.  I've made out with a homeless man.  And my three-inch erection has been on display for better-looking women than I ever thought I'd meet.  I get phone calls from radio producers at 4 a.m. on a daily basis. 
[00:50:00]  And I've had sexual relations with my brother.  I don't get paid for any of this.  I still live at home with my mother.  I will probably die a virgin.  And my dog's name is Mr. Moon again.  Hang in there.  Take it from Bobo.  Obviously, it gets better.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you!  Yeah, I'm a truck driver, and I just want to say, fuck you!  There's the manager of the store that told me to be there at 4 a.m., not 4.01. 
[00:50:30]  I get there at 3.45.  She don't show up till 4.30.  Talk about, oops, I oversplipped.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yeah, I'd like to say big fuck you to golf.  Put my balls off, drinking and smoking, hitting balls in the golf course.  For once, man, when a fucking ball goes straight, shooting my boys, trying to fucking impress.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yeah, I'd like to give a big fuck you to both my wife and Jimmy Norton.  Number one, being my wife for struggling so much when I try to pinch her nose and fart her mouth. 
[00:51:00]  And then I'll fuck you to Jim Norton for not giving me a good method of doing it.  Fuck you both.  Fuck you!  Hey, this F.U. goes out the boss.  Dude, chewing gum on the radio.  How long have you been on that gum?  You know that nicotine is seeping into your jaw through your gum line?  You're gonna look like that dude Ebert.  Yeah, Roger Ebert.  You're gonna look like him.  You know what your act's gonna sound like on stage?  Anybody wanna buy a dryer door?  Uh, uh, a few of us. 
[00:51:30]  Fuck you!  This F.U. goes out to Les Zeppelin.  Claiming to be like Les Zeppelin is like the WNBA claiming to be the NBA.  Not good.  It's like dudes playing left-handed.  F.U. Led Zeppelin.  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a big fuck you to Governor Rick Scott.  Alien-looking motherfucker.  For cutting teachers' salaries by 3% while using taxpayer money, put your name on the  Florida welcome sign. 
[00:52:00]  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a big fuck you to God for putting something as wonderful as a pussy on  something as horrible as a fucking woman.  I bet you think it's real funny if they're sniffing at your ass off.  A lot of guys gotta put all this fucking bullshit just gonna stick our dick in a worm wet hole.  Fuck you, God.  Fuck you!  Yeah, this F.U. goes out to my stupid, cunt wife.  First, you fall asleep on the fucking couch while I'm at work. 
[00:52:30]  And then I come home and find that our daughter chopped all her fucking hair off with a pair of scissors.  And then you find a way to blame me for it.  Then you throw me out of my own house.  Then while I'm out getting drunk at a bar trying to drink away my fucking sorrows because of your sorry ass,  you call me back saying,  You gotta come back.  We got an appointment to get her hair cut.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Call the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1  That's 866-FU-LINE-1 
[00:53:00]  This is the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  It's the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  The O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  The O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  The O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  The O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  The O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  The O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  Thumbs up or down, Am?  Down.  Never?  Never.  I don't think there's one fucking Punkin's song that I really enjoy. 
[00:53:30]  Sorry.  Just not into him.  That whole whiny thing he does.  This song's just a weird...  I don't know.  I like...  I'm not a big fan.  No.  No, even in what they call...  The day.  The day.  What day was that?  I don't know. 
[00:54:00]  1979.  Yeah.  That's true.  So what the hell's going on at these state fairs, man?  I don't know.  People that's becoming dangerous.  Five dead, 40 injured.  40 injured.  A big stage collapse.  It wasn't even like the stage collapse.  The whole thing.  The wind took it.  Kind of pushed it over and forward into where all the big fans were standing at the front  of the stage. 
[00:54:30]  And it's just like metal truss work and lighting rigs and everything just kind of fell down.  How many dead?  40?  Five.  Five.  Five dead, 40 injured.  And they have video.  You can see it.  It's pretty fucking...  Pretty intense.  Because you can just see the people that were standing there.  And then they're just...  They're gone.  They're gone.  They're underneath wreckage.  Oh, look at that.  Look at the...  You can just see the wind is...  And the whole stage starts coming apart. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, my...  Oh, look at that.  Damn it.  Wow.  There's only five dead from that?  I know, right?  It had to be the people right under the main structure, that beam.  Wow, man.  They cleared out fast.  Yeah.  Why are these people running away?  You're safe.  Then everyone starts running towards it.  They're standing under...  Oh, they're probably on the bleachers and thinking, nah, it's going to be next to fall down. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, my God.  Stage come apart like that.  That's fucked up, man.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  That's how you get...  Can we see that again?  That's how you get a viral video, right?  1.5 million already.  And you can see, like, the beams are just shaking.  At that point...  And I think people knew.  They started running.  Oh, yeah.  They're moving out.  But then...  I think I saw somebody that had to have died. 
[00:56:00]  That's what I'm looking for, yeah.  Had to have died.  I would have just caught it and held it up, you know, help people get out of there.  Sure.  Like super chip.  Something.  Yeah.  Yes.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Something.  Something.  What's up, baby?  You want to get some dirty talk going?  Yeah, that's it.  I'm going to give some cyber sex.  I'm good.  I'm going to lay your back or something. 
[00:56:30]  And I'm going to lick all the way down your neck like this.  I'm going to take my tongue and just go like...  I'm going to clean out your ears or something and get wax on my tongue and lick all the way down your neck.  Oh, that's a nice dark nipple.  I wouldn't mind getting some nook out of that.  And then I'm going to get my tongue and I'm going to start licking it all over your nipples so much that you start coming.  You're going to cum so much that your shoes are going to make sloshy noises. 
[00:57:00]  And I'm going to get down there and just start licking your fucking cuda really good.  I'll just...  I'll open up your cuda.  I got like long nails on my middle fingers.  So I'll dig my nails into your cuda lips and I'll open them up and I'll just go like...  And I'll get in there until you cum so many times or whatever.  I'll stick it right in you too.  I'll climb right up on you like you were building or something.  I'm going to climb on like you were a tree or something and just cram my oats in you. 
[00:57:30]  I'm going to put a finger in my ass.  It stinks.  Not too good with the sex talk.  That's terrible with sex talk.  Terrible.  Oh, wow, guys.  Breaking news.  Dan has something for the radio show.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah, man.  Something we haven't heard about yet.  Dan, go ahead.  Hey, not to be calling back so soon, but he did say call back soon.  But anyway, there's a picture of Michelle Bachman from this weekend at one of these straw poll deals, 
[00:58:00]  the Iowa straw poll.  And she's eating like a fried stick of butter, a fried corn dog or something.  And you can pretty much imagine from there.  You'll find it pretty quick.  What's this now?  A fried stick of butter?  A corn dog or something.  A corn dog?  A what?  Yes, sir.  Well, you got the idea.  I'm trying to get an idea and I need to be on my way, actually.  No, I'm just trying to figure out.  When Dan says certain words, his tongue wobbles like that stage.  It just kind of goes on. 
[00:58:30]  It doesn't know where to go.  It just collapses.  It kind of goes left and right and then just falls over on his lower palate.  But basically, at the end of the day, it looks like he's sucking a wiener.  I don't go for that, Dan.  Yeah.  Oh, Dan.  What's that?  It looks like it's a corn dog?  A dog corn or something, right, Dan?  It's more suited to Bill Murray, I suppose.  How did we avoid that picture all weekend?  I don't know.  Oh, amazing.  This guy says Oz like a bunch of Ws are running around in a circle or something.  Yeah.  Why would she take that picture? 
[00:59:00]  Isn't that so stupid?  As a politician, you really shouldn't take a picture of what amounts to looking like a  giant black cock in your mouth.  That's hot, actually.  I like her more now than I ever did.  Yeah.  She looks too toothy.  Her eye is half closed because she's enjoying the cock.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  No patience.  No patience for fucking thick tongue?  No. 
[00:59:30]  That's not right.  This fucking cathedral ceiling mouth.  Yeah.  Like, who's Michelangelo?  He's a little boy that lives in my mouth and paints the roof of it.  He's scaffolding on his tongue.  This guy on his back painting the fucking roof of his mouth.  Yeah.  Sistine twapple.  Sistine twapple.  A cathedral mouth.  All right.  Yeah.  That's annoying me. 
[01:00:00]  Put a chandelier in there and shut up.  You have no patience, huh?  None.  None whatsoever.  Yeah.  Beat it, Flair Mouth.  We're tired of you.  Yeah, the Michelle Bachman picture was everywhere over the weekend.  Good old Dan.  We even did a little caption contest for that dumb picture.  I can't believe she...  Well, I guess I can believe it.  She won the...  She won the straw poll, but everybody said she was going to.  It's that area, you know.  Did you read my caption for that?  I had a good one. 
[01:00:30]  What was it?  It looks like she's putting dicks in her fucking mouth.  I told Ant before the show, it's all bullshit.  You got Obama's approval rating below 40%.  You got this stupid broad winning the Iowa straw poll.  Is she a religious conservative?  Like a fucking no abortion, no gays, no stem cell?  She's pretty fucking conservative.  She's pretty far right. 
[01:01:00]  I honestly think Mitt Romney's going to get the nomination.  She's a joke, right, Ant?  You know this shit more than I do.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, people are taking her seriously, but when the old push comes to shove...  They'll push it right out of the fucking way.  I think they're going to know that in order to win this next election,  they've got to go back to basics with a, you know, white, presidential-looking guy.  With dark hair.  And that's fucking Mitt Romney.  Full head of hair.  Yeah, he's just got to get past the Mormon thing, 
[01:01:30]  but I don't think too many people are pissed at that.  You got a lot of middle America Christians that he's got to win over, but...  Oh boy, that's going to be tough.  But you know what?  That's going to be tough, don't you think?  Not against fucking the incumbent, that's for sure.  Because they certainly don't like him.  Obama with his 39% approval rating.  Ouch.  What happened?  He's even losing his base.  I don't know.  Yeah, he's going to...  I really... 
[01:02:00]  I want him to turn it around, because the stock market...  Look, I'm certainly no expert, but it's fucking...  It got better.  It did get better.  Yeah, people...  I think 2008 really showed people that it will come back.  No matter how shitty it looks on any given day, it's not going to be that shitty again  for a long time.  People have that knee-jerk shit with the market.  It's like, panic!  Get out!  And I happen to believe that when the market goes down that much, that it's people that  know the market, that make a lot of money in it, pulling out, waiting to buy, and taking 
[01:02:30]  other people's fucking money.  That's what they're doing.  They're smart.  That's why the market swings like that.  What?  Things all of a sudden got better?  Well, the fucking market went back up 400, 500 points because...  Because what?  We got our AAA rating back?  No.  Did we?  No.  When's it coming back?  Never.  Could take years.  Could take, you know...  Somebody to go in there and punch S&P around a little bit. 
[01:03:00]  What do you think about Warren Buffett?  Warren Buffett?  He has an oracle...  I like that Margarita Phelps song.  Eric, how disappointed were you when you met him or when you realized you had been pronouncing  his last name wrong?  I'm just kidding.  Love you.  That is hilarious.  Get it?  Yes.  Like Bill Smorgasbord.  I'm sorry.  Warren Buffett basically saying that the Uber Rich have been getting away with murder and  they should be taxed more. 
[01:03:30]  It's easy for Warren Buffett to say now that he's an older guy at the end of his life with  his money safely tucked away.  Of course.  That's why I have a problem with Warren Buffett.  Why didn't he say this years ago when he knew he was, you know, getting the better end  of the stick?  Because he wanted to keep his case.  I hate when these guys come out, you know, when it doesn't matter to them anymore.  And then talks about what's right.  Doing my part.  So shut the fuck up, everybody that wants to tax me more. 
[01:04:00]  I'm doing my part.  I just wrote a giant check again for taxes.  It's all I seem to do.  Why don't they do September 15th?  They're not doing August, are they?  No, for fucking property taxes and shit for Nassau.  But it's like, you know, it's fucking blow me with you.  I'm not doing my share.  We all got to fucking make sacrifices.  I'm constantly writing giant checks for taxes.  So fuck off.  How about the 50% that isn't paying a dime? 
[01:04:30]  Start taxing them on a flat tax rate.  I'm tired of it.  You make fucking $1 a year.  Give 17 cents to the fucking government, you prick.  You freeloading fuckwad.  We got to get Keith Robinson in here to discuss.  Oh, yeah.  We had a screaming match at the cellar the other night.  Really?  What's his take?  I mean, we know.  I said that Reagan was a decent president.  I wasn't saying Reagan was a great president.  Yes.  I just have to do that.  Because I know that he really was not good to poor people, so I don't blame poor people  or black people for not really loving Reagan. 
[01:05:00]  But he just wasn't listening because he was drinking wine, and he was just screaming.  We were just yelling at each other.  Me, him, and Pete Correale is just sitting there.  He wasn't drinking Sizzurp?  No.  He was drinking some wine.  And then Robin Williams came in with his son, so nobody wanted to yell anymore.  Oh, yeah.  Why?  No, because then Keith went downstairs to finish hosting.  When he came back up, Robin was there.  Robin Hang, like one of the guys?  He's the honest dude.  He's one of the nicest guys.  There's nothing pretentious about him.  So I'm reading the tweets coming in. 
[01:05:30]  Warren Buffett is simply amazing for this article.  Warren Buffett, what a man.  Stop coddling the super rich by Mr. Warren Buffett himself.  Yeah.  Don't coddle.  But it's real brave.  How old is he?  Old enough where...  The system worked for him for many, many fucking years.  He's not going to run out of money.  Why is he brave for saying it now?  He should have said this 10 years ago.  Right.  He knew this shit was going on 10 years ago.  He kept his mouth shut.  So why is he a hero today? 
[01:06:00]  They could tax 100% of the rich, and it still isn't going to cover it.  They've got to find a different way.  I think cutting fucking the budget.  There's too much waste.  There's so much fucking waste and crime and graft and bullshit going on.  Here's a quote, Ant, from the article.  My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress.  It's time for government to get serious. 
[01:06:30]  I guess I'm glad it's coming out, but why not years ago when you knew this shit was going on, Mr. Buffett?  You know, that's it.  Cut the defense budget.  There you go.  I'm not talking about cutting things that give people jobs, by the way.  These stupid social programs that don't do anything.  They perpetuate fucking criminals.  Criminals.  How about you cut some of that shit?  That's what I say. 
[01:07:00]  He's doing some reading over the weekend.  Fascinating.  Reading and video watching.  Wow.  Just keeps backing me up.  What happened in Detroit over the weekend?  Oh, a couple of shootings.  It's good, though.  All done with, you know, legal weapons by very good people that are responsible with guns.  And there must have just been people defending themselves.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  There were people shot at a fucking welcome home party for an assault and attempted murder guy. 
[01:07:30]  And, gee, there was gunfire at the party.  Who's going to that party?  Holy shit.  Whenever I'm invited to a party, I say, look, how many black people are going to be there?  If somebody says two or more, I don't go because I'm afraid.  And I don't want to be afraid.  I don't want gunplay, black people.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Gunplay.  Stop it.  Gunplay.  Have a fun party. 
[01:08:00]  Just have a fun party.  It's very hard to have a fun, like, a block party or one of these back.  Because there's always people that want to show up that aren't invited.  I don't know what that's all about.  Like, if somebody shows up at a party where you're not invited, you turn around and go,  hey, excuse me, you're not invited here.  Could you leave?  And then they leave and don't come back with fucking, you know, AR-15s and AK-47s.  How about you say this is an A and B party.  Why don't you see your way out of it?  Ah, I got it.  A, B, C.  That's good. 
[01:08:30]  That's a good one.  Were the six dead all at one party?  No, 15 shot.  What does that say at the top there?  15 shot over the weekend?  15 people shot, six dead in 24 hours in Detroit.  Wow.  Once again, just showing poor marksmanship also happening over there in the day.  Yeah, 15 shot, six dead in 24 hours.  And, you know, I guess they didn't hear about the laws, you know? 
[01:09:00]  You're not supposed to have those guns.  If they would tell these people that there are laws against that, I'm sure no one would get shot.  See, I think that you're being naive, but that wouldn't help.  Really?  I didn't think I was being naive.  I thought they'd pay attention to the laws that are already in place instead of implementing new laws against law-abiding citizens that want to exercise their Second Amendment right.  You know, a right given you by the Constitution.  But, no. 
[01:09:30]  So, 15 people shot, six dead.  Again, turn your gun up.  You might get a better percentage.  Don't have it sideways.  Maybe clean it once or twice so you don't get a stovepipe jam after the first shot goes off and hits grandma or a baby carriage.  Jesus Christ, go to the range.  You think all those guys shoot to kill, though, or are they just shooting?  They're just shooting into crowds or through windows.  It's just amazing.  I'll tell you something. 
[01:10:00]  You get that front sight, right?  You put it between the two rear sights, and then put your target right in front of the whole schmear, and then pull the trigger.  Don't just pull it out and fire from the hip, guys.  You get a much higher percentage.  Your shot-to-kill ratio.  That should be your...  Very bad in Detroit.  That should be your next video.  Yeah.  That's funny, actually.  Do some side shooting and then show how it's done proper.  Side shooting, how it's done real.  But I think a lot of those...  90-degree turn clockwise. 
[01:10:30]  But I think a lot of those guys don't shoot to kill.  They're just fucking shooting willy-nilly.  Just to be like...  Yeah, like tough and stuff.  Like tough guy?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, hey, kick me out of your party.  Right.  I want to be at the party!  Right.  And then they just shoot some guns.  Yeah.  Yeah, I really believe that.  I think you're right.  I really believe that.  It's much braver to fucking aim and kill the person.  Yeah.  That's what I'm getting at.  You know, you go to the range, you practice a little bit.  I don't know. 
[01:11:00]  Maybe they won't let you there with illegal fucking guns.  Do they check that?  The serial number's stripped off.  Yeah, well, in some states...  In New York, they do.  If you have a pistol, you've got to show your pistol license before you can fire it at a range.  But, I don't know.  Maybe shooting some shit in a back alley somewhere.  Just practice a little.  Before you pull it out at a party with fucking children and old people.  And just wail into the crowd.  Maybe pick an intended target.  Maybe someone that did you wrong. 
[01:11:30]  A drug dealer or something.  I love this.  Silly Goose writes, great.  And it's giving accuracy shooting tips to killers.  Now they'll kill more people.  They're not killers.  They don't want to be killers.  They want to look like tough guys.  So they go sideways and just shoot willy-nilly.  And, you know, if someone dies, someone dies.  And honestly...  You know guns.  If you want to kill somebody, you're going to kill them, right, Ann?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And a lot of black on black crime, gun crime...  It's black on black gun crime.  There's a lot of robberies and assaults. 
[01:12:00]  That are black on white.  But I think gunplay, a lot of the gunplay is black on black.  And it's usually a couple of people that, you know, not very desirable as far as the community goes.  Maybe drug dealers and the like.  So I would actually enjoy seeing some of these drug dealers and riffraff and stuff shooting a little more accurately at each other.  So that the innocent kid in the carriage, uh, in the stroller or the little grandma with the walker with the little tennis balls on the front, uh, doesn't just get mowed down in, uh, you know, on a sidewalk because this idiot doesn't know how to aim his gun. 
[01:12:30]  And clean your weapons.  You don't know how to fucking...  You can't shoot a fucking gun that's all caked up.  Your fucking breach jams it right up.  Mm-hmm.  It's not going to eject the round good enough.  Oh, please. 
[01:13:00]  Your rifling's all clogged.  Clean weapons.  There you go.  Tips from Anthony.  Uh, Sean in...  I'm helping.  Sean in Georgia.  Sean.  Hey, sweetheart.  Hey.  I used to buy drugs down in Detroit all the time.  I grew up right outside of Detroit.  What kind of drugs, for the reference point?  Yeah, pot.  Nothing crazy.  Pots and mushrooms.  But, you know, the gangbangers down there, that's all they're into is selling drugs to white people.  Yeah, I would assume if you're a white person going into the ghetto, it doesn't mean you're going to be fucking hassled with and killed. 
[01:13:30]  No.  Because that's income coming into the community.  Oh, there's going to be some people ripping you off and stuff.  Sure, but when they see Whitey coming, they know that he has money and he's going to, you know, buy some product.  And you end up dead, you probably fucked someone over.  Sure.  I understand.  Exactly, Anthony.  You're going to be ripped off no matter where you're coming from, no matter who you are, no matter where you are.  It's just, you know, in downtown ghettos like that, you've got to be smart about it, just like anywhere else.  Did you have problems when you went into Detroit to buy drugs? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, I used to go downtown when I was a teenager.  I used to go downtown all the time.  I never had problems.  Downtown.  Yeah, but you said you have to be smart about it.  How are you smart about it?  Well, yeah, yeah.  I used to, you know, you've got to talk to the right people, find out where they go, find out which gangbangers aren't going to just beat the piss out of you.  Well, why would they beat the piss out of you if they want you to come back? 
[01:14:30]  That's the point.  Like that, hold on, hold on.  My brother owns FH Riley's.  So let's break it down.  Break it down.  Geez, I love this analogy.  Break it down.  So you go to FH Riley's and you have a nice, lovely dinner.  Okay?  But on the way out, Brett beats the shit out of you.  Why would you ever come back to the restaurant?  You want people to come back for your business.  I'll tell you something, because if Brett could beat the shit out of the guy, not have to spend any money on product on that guy, take his money, and know that there's an unlimited supply of customers still waiting to come in the door. 
[01:15:00]  You think that's what it is?  Maybe he would do it.  Yeah.  It's not just the same dumb white guy that's going in there.  If I was a drug dealer, I wouldn't be beating up my customers, because I would assume they're going to come back multiple times.  Not a lot of nobility in that business.  Charlie doesn't make up a five-square-mile block.  Not the best business model.  I love the visual of Brett beating the shit out of people, though.  He's taking their money and going, get the fuck out.  And then shoving them out, and there's a line of people down the block.  Is that what's going on? 
[01:15:30]  He's waiting to come in, and sometimes he serves them food.  You know what?  Saturday nights are getting a little rough to get a table at FH Riley's, so maybe he should start beating up some people after they eat.  Hey, FH Riley's is not one small place compared to an entire city, an entire ghetto, where all kinds of different people are in it for different reasons.  I think some of those gangbangers should take some business classes.  Yeah.  Like Stringer Bell.  Stringer Bell, yeah.  That's right.  Ended up well for him, didn't it?  Oh, that's right.  You just can't continue to beat up your customers if you expect your business to thrive. 
[01:16:00]  Beat up your customers.  Now, remember, you got to beat the shit out your customers every so often.  Oh, we're taking notes.  Oh, beat the shit out of the customer.  Gary on Long Island.  Gary.  Yo, what's up?  Opie, just to answer your question about Warren Buffett, the reason why he's running his fucking mouth is because he doesn't pay income tax.  He pays capital gains tax.  He only pays himself like $100,000 a year. 
[01:16:30]  No.  He's shooting his fucking mouth off.  So, Anthony probably knows more about as far as income tax compared to capital gains tax.  But that's how he's been skating all of these years.  He's been running his mouth for a long time.  Look, I don't disagree with what Warren Buffett is saying.  And trust me, we're not on anywhere near that level.  But it just bothers me that he comes out now knowing that the system did him right for many, many fucking years, man.  Yeah.  Oh, and just to answer your question for what you were just saying is, that guy you just had on the phone, I don't know what he's talking about. 
[01:17:00]  He was probably getting his ass handed to him because he came through short and the guy that was selling it to him.  That's probably why they're just fucking him up.  Okay?  But when a white guy comes through, it's one of two things.  It makes you leery because he's a cop, and he's guaranteed to always come through with more than $100.  The black beans that come by, for the most part, they're $10 or $20 every visit.  When a white guy comes through, he's spending a couple hundred dollars.  Trust me, I know. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, that's what I'm getting at.  So you want to be nicer to the white customer?  Of course you do.  It's basically because I know a lot of people that, no matter if you're buying weed, coke, or heroin, when a white guy comes through, look, I know people that jump in a car with him and they go have a couple of drinks because this guy's guaranteed to drop at least minimum $300.  Yeah, so why would you beat the shit out of the guy and take his money knowing he's going to come back a lot?  That guy don't know what the fuck he's talking about because instead of coming through with $300, he'll come through with $17 looking for a $20. 
[01:18:00]  And winds up getting fucked up.  Hey, Gary, hold on a line. I want you to take care of a few people for me.  All right.  No, I'm serious. I'm getting your phone number. What part of Long Island are you on?  No, I work in Long Island. I'm on the Southern Estate, exit 27 right now.  What do you do for a living?  I fix cars.  I used to go cop drugs. I would just walk in there and I would just go, give me like a 30 piece or something.  Yeah.  What did you chip?  I always believe that white people in general are safe in the ghetto if you're going up there to get drugs. 
[01:18:30]  They are.  You're a dumb fucking drug dealer if you're going to beat the shit out of the white guy and take his wallet knowing he would probably come back.  If you look like a victim, if you look like an easy mark.  Dude, the drugs are marked up to begin with, so you're not saving much by fucking not giving them the drugs, right?  Yeah, well, but here's the thing. It's not even, and a lot of, and a lot of things, it's not even gangbangers because number one, as far as New York goes, gangs really, believe it or not, gangs really aren't that hardcore like they are out there. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, it's not like L.A. or something like that, yeah.  Now, out here in New York, it's like you can know some people in the gang, but it's like, okay, well, they're just making sure that, like, those Mexicans don't come over here and start no shit.  Or if you're blood, if you're a crib, make sure they don't come through your neighborhood fucking around.  So this way, everybody makes money on the block.  But when a white guy comes through, it's like, yo, you know this guy?  Is he a cop or whatever?  And once it's established that he's not a cop, look, he come out, you go buy him a beer.  Like, look, yo, come back through. 
[01:19:30]  He'll come back through in an hour.  You may probably like, depending on what you're selling, you could probably make $600 just off of him.  Oh, good old white people, right?  It's true.  That's what I always thought.  I will say that when I went to Harlem, this is when I was probably, I'm maybe 17, my friend Rodney and I went.  I had no money.  I didn't have a dollar.  He paid my bus fare and everything.  He was a drug dealer.  And he took me to Harlem.  And we were on, like, 145th and Edgecombe, I think is where we went.  And there was these Jamaican guys.  I was looking for a house up there.  No, they weren't selling at the time.  It was very hard. 
[01:20:00]  Yes, if you had $1.80, you could get a home.  It was fucking horrifying.  In one of them, they wouldn't let me in the building because they didn't trust me.  Yeah, because you look like a cop.  I sat on the stoop, but nobody was mean to me.  No, because Jimmy was only 17, Gary.  Yeah, I think that they just knew I wasn't, I think they knew I wasn't buying.  So I'm sitting on the stoop, and either that or Rodney asked me.  It might have been Rodney.  What was Rodney getting up there?  I think he was buying pop or coke.  I don't remember.  But he might have asked me to stay there just so it didn't make him look weaker, because  I was like a nerd with my tango. 
[01:20:30]  I didn't look tough.  It might have made him look like a faggot.  Your Lord's jacket on?  Listen, listen.  No, Jimmy.  Regardless if you were 17, what they also used to do is they would send somebody like you.  I mean, even though you was young, you could be a young-looking cop.  Because you made me, I think me and you were about the same age.  Because when I was in high school, that's when 21 Jump Street first came on TV.  Oh, okay.  And they would institute that into certain schools.  I went to Thomas Edison High School.  So it's like they had undercover cops in there.  So you could be going uptown, and your friend could be copping something. 
[01:21:00]  They look at you like, you know what, this must be.  He may be looking young, but he still may be a cop.  He's not getting in the building.  It's bad enough he knows where we're at.  Oh, you know what?  Maybe that was, because the guy wasn't, like I sat on the stoop waiting for Rodney to come out.  And the guy goes, could you sit on the other stoop because they were doing business?  Oh, shit.  But he was actually, he was polite.  Yeah?  He said, no offense, if you could just, because we're, he asked me very nicely and politely if I would just sit on the next one.  And we went into one apartment.  I remember, I forget, the guy opened the door, and he had a pistol in his hand. 
[01:21:30]  Jesus, Jimmy.  And he opens the door, and he peeks out at me and Rodney.  Wasn't this Saturday?  Oh.  And he lets us in, and it was really, they were Jamaicans.  And I think it was just pot that he was buying.  But I think it was a very dangerous situation.  Yeah, it probably was.  Let me ask Gary then, because I see the phone's just lit up, Gary.  And a lot of people saying, yeah, you know, just because you're white doesn't guarantee you're going to get beat up in the hood.  And a lot of these guys have been left alone over the years.  What gets you beat up in the hood in that situation then? 
[01:22:00]  When you're drawing attention to yourself, when you're acting like a dick, when you're coming through fucked up.  Like, if you're high off coke, and you come in to cop some more, and you're out there, and the guy's like, yo, cops just rode through.  Yo, go around the corner.  He's like, no, look, I'm just coming through the cop's up.  And it's like, yo, I'll be there.  Just go around the corner.  And you're still standing there, and it's like, look, I'm about to fuck you up.  Go around the corner, and I'll meet you there.  And that's what'll get you fucked up.  Simple and plain.  And to be honest with you, a cop's best friend is a drug dealer because, look, a drug dealer, his main focus is one thing, to make money. 
[01:22:30]  I'm not trying to start no shit with the cop.  If the cops come through, pat me down, I don't have nothing on me.  It's not like, yo, I know my fucking rights, because then the cop's going to get agitated.  And it's like, you know what, you're being a dick right now.  So I'm going to hold you here, or I'm going to start searching the area.  So if cops come through, it's like, how you doing, officer?  And you talk a little bit.  The cops know what you're doing.  It's basically, look, I don't feel like doing the paperwork. 
[01:23:00]  You don't feel like going to jail.  What's good?  It's like, look, I'm not fucking with nobody out here.  No.  The cop, basically, nowadays, the cops are like, look, do you got, any of y'all got guns?  No.  I hate it.  As long as you don't have guns on you.  That's all.  As the guy wants to make money, the cop understands that he doesn't feel like doing the paperwork.  I'm not bad-mouthing cops.  I love cops because my mother takes the train to work, and she's been doing it since I was a kid.  You know, but cops and drug dealers, they kind of, you know, as long as you have respect when they come through. 
[01:23:30]  Do you know what I wondered, too?  I had one incident where I was, I walked with my friend into the New Brunswick Housing Project.  Jesus.  I was drunk, and I was going to buy, I was actually going to buy crack.  That's when I started smoking that.  We were smoking in joint style, whatever.  And there was a bunch of dealers outside one of the buildings, and I remember the one guy said, now, let's do it inside.  He took me inside.  He took me up a flight of steps into the stairwell, and my friend, actually, that guy, Rodney, who lived in New Brunswick.  Hey, let's get some crack, all right? 
[01:24:00]  What do you say, huh?  Hey, how are you?  I got a prescription from Vinnie Boombat.  It's my doctor, Vinnie Boombat.  Walked into the building.  He goes, no, no, no, he's with me.  He's with me.  And I didn't know Rodney was even there that night.  Oh, boy.  And Rodney sold it to me.  Or the guy, I don't remember who sold it to me, but I wondered if that guy was taking me up those steps to rob me or sell me.  Because it was weird that he took me into the building.  I always wanted to have seen Rodney that night save me from a fucking... 
[01:24:30]  And I was very greasy-haired.  I'll tell you like this.  For the most point, the people that you get robbed by, they aren't actually drug dealers.  You got basically two type of people out there that's selling drugs.  You got the ones that make the money and the ones that don't really make the money, but they got to pay the person that's supplying them.  So they got to compensate for robbing people.  So, like, if I got better product than you, and I'm making more money than you that night, but by the end of the week, you got to pay this guy back. 
[01:25:00]  It's like, okay, I'm basically going to rob his customers.  After they come see me, then they're going to rob you to get, you know, to compensate for the money that they're not making selling drugs because their product isn't as pure or is as good as mine.  So those are the people that rob you because, I mean, your analogy is good.  It's like, now, why would you rob somebody that's giving you money?  The only reason why you would do that is because you're not making as much because the shit that you're selling is garbage.  You cannot, believe it or not, nobody's really, I mean, there are stupid people out there, but nobody really is that stupid. 
[01:25:30]  A drug dealer's main focus is money at the end of the day.  Never fuck me, Tony.  Right.  Don't fuck me.  Oh, Gary was better.  Oh, Rodney was better.  Rodney was better.  I mean, you said you had a friend that sold drugs, Jimmy.  Like, if you say that your friend sold it to you, he's a drug dealer.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  We lose you, brother.  Way to go.  We didn't hang up on you.  Oh, fuck.  Please make sure he knows we didn't hang up on him.  Gary, if you're listening, we didn't fucking hang up on you.  Yeah, call back.  I'm not that fucking brave.  I did not hang up on Gary.  I'm panicking.  Okay, I'll be all right.  His phone card ran out.  Oh, shit.  LOL.  It's funny.  I did want, oh, go ahead, Jimmy.  Me and my other friend were walking down Rodney's block.  I was drunk.  We were going to walk to the projects one night, and we walked by Rodney's block, and there 
[01:26:30]  was like 20, like I was probably 17.  There was like a bunch of black kids on the block.  They were probably like 14, 15.  I don't know why they all had sticks, but all I know is that we stood out at like one  in the morning in New Brunswick.  Certainly would, huh?  And they, oh yeah, I think I've told the story, and they chased us, and we fucking headed  right back towards North Brunswick with fucking 15 guys on our heels, and the one guy whacked  me with a stick, and I picked up a rock and just threw it through a gas station window,  hoping to set off an alarm, because I think we were going to get murdered, and that was 
[01:27:00]  when my buddy goes, leave him alone, to the guy who hit me.  Oh, leave him alone.  I know.  That was terrible.  Oh yeah, I had a butcher knife with me.  That's right.  I had a big steak knife.  What happened to Rodney?  I don't know.  I never saw him again.  When did you see him last?  Probably 1987, when I got sober, in 86.  I haven't seen him in 25 years.  You think he's still alive?  Yeah, I saw another buddy of mine, Antoine, who I used to get high with, doing like a legit 
[01:27:30]  job.  He was never a drug dealer, so I was happy to see him.  I saw him about eight, nine years ago, but I was happy to see him doing well.  You know, at least he's alive and kicking.  I hope Gary calls back, because I want to know if he's still in the game.  Yeah, yeah, I enjoyed that.  You think he's still doing it?  Not if he's working as a...  You know what?  If he's a mechanic, maybe he sells to customers, but I don't know.  He might just have a legit job now.  Let me say hi to David in Jersey.  David.  Yeah.  Hey. 
[01:28:00]  What's going on, guys?  Hey, buddy.  I was just calling to say, when I was in Northeast Philly, getting dope every day from the Puerto  Rican gentleman up there, I never once had a problem.  Like, if you go to the...  Even dealers you don't know, they're nothing but kind, and they reach out to you.  They reach out to you.  That's so nice.  They're kind.  Like, what Gary or whatever his name is saying is, right?  Like, you can get beat or whatever, but it's by guys that you don't have business going 
[01:28:30]  to.  Like, if you don't know what you're doing, and you look odd, they'll see a white guy going  through the hood, and they'll, they'll, like, run your pockets or get you out of the car  or whatever.  Staggering around or some shit.  Yeah.  Exactly.  But if they know you're going to be a good customer, why would they ever fuck with you?  Fucking a fool.  Catch a motherfucker slipping.  Sorry, brother.  Let me go to Sal in Jersey.  Trying to get a few of these on the air.  Sal.  Hello.  I need crack, bro. 
[01:29:00]  Sal, go ahead, buddy.  Yeah, listen.  It's just like everybody says.  You don't get robbed by drug dealers.  You get robbed by the junkies and stuff that are looking.  They're looking to cop themselves, and so they wait for Mark to come.  They'll pose as a drug dealer, and they'll take you all your stuff.  But if you go to a good neighborhood, you know, where you're establishing.  You've got to go to a reputable drug deal.  That's what he's saying.  A good neighborhood.  You could leave your car running.  I used to know places in Harlem where you could leave your car running, and you could run 
[01:29:30]  upstairs, get whatever you wanted, and then you go back downstairs, your car was still  wired, and they were watching your car and everything.  Nobody would fuck with you.  But once you go there at the wrong time, and the junkies are out, and the whores are out,  and they're looking to get the supplies for the day also, they're going to look for Mark.  You're the Mark.  When you walk in, and you're white, and you walk into one of those neighborhoods, you're  a Mark.  So if you don't know where you're going, and if you don't know who you look, and they  don't know you, you're going to get hit.  My friend Mike, who was a bodybuilder, you just reminded me of something, Sal. 
[01:30:00]  My friend Mike was a bodybuilder.  I met him in sobriety.  And he told a story one time how he was just on this binge with a hooker or whatever, and  it was in New York somewhere, Harlem or the Bronx, whatever.  And they went up into the building and got high, and he had no money.  And he came down in the morning, and he said his fucking car was up on blocks.  And he said, I just sat on the steps and cried.  Mike's dead.  He relapsed and had a heart attack.  Too bad.  Sorry about that.  He's a good boy. 
[01:30:30]  Well, Sal brings up a good point here.  I mean, yeah, you are a Mark when you move, when you're going to the hood, but it's not  happening by the drug dealers that want your fucking business.  It's the people that want drugs but don't have money.  Well, the best thing to do, if a guy tries to rob you and you're going in there, just go,  I'd like to speak to your manager, please.  Stop and go, oh, all right.  Let's go to Ryan.  Ryan.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey, man.  So, you know, interesting topic you guys got on here.  You know, I used to go uptown all the time to cop weed. 
[01:31:00]  And, you know, we used to go to Brooklyn at first, but then being white kids, you know,  there's a little suspect in Brooklyn.  So, you know, the basic difference between the two is when you go uptown to Harlem,  they got product and they want your business.  They're businessmen up there.  In Brooklyn, they ain't got shit.  They're going to rob you.  I've actually been up in a spot in Harlem and the guy came in and robbed us in the spot.  And the guy from behind the counter came out, chased him down the street with a gun, 
[01:31:30]  beat him, got our shit, came back, gave us free shit and apologized.  Really?  I guess because they also, if you're a white guy going there, and that's the last thing  that spot wants is to get the word out and go, dude, don't go there.  I got robbed.  And they lose fucking, you know, fucking three or four grand a week because of one asshole  fucking junkie.  Word of mouth is very important.  Very important in the drug trade.  You bet.  We went back to the island and we told everybody, when we got back to Northport, we were like, 
[01:32:00]  yo, guys, you'll never guess what happened.  Northport.  Oh, my God.  The white people from Northport.  The whitest town on Long Island and you're going up there to cop.  Hilarious.  What did you say when the guy ran out with his, did you yell, masher, masher?  Why you?  No, you know, we stood there like dumb white kids with our hands up, like, holy shit, don't  shoot us.  We just want some weed.  Right.  Fucking Northport is the whitest town.  Making me want to do drugs again.  Jesus, I'm going to get high.  Sounds fun, doesn't it?  Jesus, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:32:30]  Joe on Long Island is an ex-undercover.  Hey, boys, what's going on?  Retired.  What's up, Joe?  Retired NYPD.  Nice.  I bought drugs for about eight years.  I bought drugs for about three and a half.  And I don't know where these guys were buying or what years they were buying, but they were  nice to me, the brothers and the Spaniards out there in Manhattan.  No?  Not at all, man.  So, I mean, we used to get guns put on our faces, knives put on us.  What years was this? 
[01:33:00]  Like late 80s, early 90s.  Yeah, it was pretty rough and tumble back then.  Yeah, the projects in the Lower East Side and the Deuce, there was no Disney store.  No, no.  So, wait, when you'd walk in, would they rob you or would they just make sure that you  weren't a cop even though you were?  They used to want to know if you were a cop, make you, you know, you had to show track marks  and you had to, you know, pull your shirt up in case they wanted to see if you had a  wire or a gun on or they would search you and stuff like that.  So, you had to really be on your fucking toes and, you know, they saw us coming a mile 
[01:33:30]  away, the white guys.  Oh, wow.  They have a cover story.  But if you're in that line of work and you know they're looking for track marks, what do  you guys do?  You tell them you shoot behind your ball bag and you've got to take your cock out and  they usually say, no, that's all right.  See, I knew you had an answer.  I shoot behind your ball bag.  There's never a plan A and B. There's always got to be a plan C when you're doing that shit  because A and B never work.  Did you ever have it where you got like, where they knew you were a cop?  Yeah, a few times. 
[01:34:00]  I mean, when you've got to pull your gun and put it in the guy's mouth sometimes and  then they kind of figure it out.  Now, in that situation when you're buying, as long as you're not like in a deserted warehouse,  if they find out you're a cop, are they going to kill you or just fucking walk away from  you?  I mean, usually they, you know, once they kind of know the jig is up, they kind of just  want to fight their way out.  So, usually you just at that point it gets to a big brawl.  Wow.  What a line of work.  Holy shit, man.  Yeah, and that's when the cavalry comes in and then everybody piles on the rabbit.  Okay. 
[01:34:30]  Pile on the rabbit.  Did you ever give yourself away by like, when you went to buy drugs, by like acting like  you were in a real store and saying, I'd like to make a purchase, please?  Is that a giveaway?  I have acted like a retard, like a fag.  Like this radio show.  Whatever it takes.  I mean, you know, sometimes you wing it.  You walk down the block and you see who's out there.  And if there's a hooker out there, you wing it like you're going to hook her up.  And, you know, and she hooks you up.  And then you just take it from there. 
[01:35:00]  I mean, it's, it was fun, but it was also kind of fucked up in a lot of ways.  What was the scariest, like, or the closest you came to, you think, getting really fucking  injured, doing an undercover by?  Uh, I got bit by a, uh, HIV, we ended up finding out it was an HIV positive junkie.  And the thing that scared me is that I punched his teeth out before he bit me.  So he was all bleeding when he broke my skin.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  And the fucking district attorney's office didn't want to drop the charges to give him  a fucking drug test.  So we ended up backdooring it somehow. 
[01:35:30]  We got him tested, but the fucking PD wouldn't even pay for my testing.  I had to get that done privately.  He was, he was positive.  I went for AIDS testing for like a year and change to some doctor that one of the other  guys knew.  And I came back clean, thankfully.  And this was like fucking 10 years, 10, you know, almost 20 years ago now.  Shouldn't they be mandatory testing if the guy bites you?  I think so.  We used to get poked all the time by fucking guys had works in their pockets and they wouldn't  tell us when we asked them.  And you get fucking poked by a needle sticking out of his pocket. 
[01:36:00]  So yeah, they should be.  But you know, I don't know if things have changed since then.  But back then it was kind of really just a fucking, you know, dog eat dog type of thing.  Well, it's medical confidence laws and all that shit, but doesn't that go a little  too far when a fucking cop gets bitten and wants to get an AIDS test and he wants  to know?  Or if someone's raped?  There's been cases where women were raped and they couldn't get the results of the  fucking rapist.  Yeah.  It's like, is that really what the privacy laws are intended to do?  Protect guys with fucking needles and rapists?  It's the fucking liberal society we live in, unfortunately. 
[01:36:30]  It certainly is.  It's silly.  Sir.  All right, brother.  Very cool, man.  Yeah, right on, Joe.  Thank you.  All right, boys.  Good one.  Bye, Joe.  Joe from Long Island and Gary's calling back to end this.  Gary, what's up?  Sorry about that.  No, no, no.  I heard it at no end.  My phone call didn't run out.  You know what's funny?  As I meant to tell you before my phone disconnected, I'm your friend on Twitter, too.  Which one are you?  I'm not going to get my whole name out there like that.  I know you got a lot of followers, but it's just, I only got two friends, which is Ant, 
[01:37:00]  and I forget the other comedian's name.  I just, I joined on Twitter, and then I got rid of it, and then I got back on, and it's  like, I really don't fuck with the account, so, like, it just dawned on me when my phone  dies.  Hey, are you, uh, are you, are you still doing the drug thing, or are you out of that?  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  That was, like, I'm 38, I got a job now, you know, got a good-paying job, you know, I have  a daughter, I'm a family man.  But, you know, it's really, as far as New York goes, there's really nothing in New York 
[01:37:30]  now.  All the drug dealers that still do make money, those are the ones you see falling now that,  you know, they get caught with, like, $100,000 and stuff like that.  Those are the ones that were doing it from back in the days.  For the most part, everybody else went out of state.  Atlanta, Florida, Connecticut.  And they kind of pushed them out, yeah.  You still get, like, some of the shit in Washington Square Park and shit, right?  Yeah.  You know, it's...  Nah.  But those are, like, punks. 
[01:38:00]  Not really.  No?  Yeah, I mean, and those aren't, those...  Well, when are you trolling through there at 2 in the morning, Ope?  No, I've been down there a million times, I can't imagine there's still a fucking drug  trade down there, to be honest with you.  It's all hipsters and fucking...  Everybody's buying...  I'm sure you're right in the middle of the night, but...  Yeah, probably in the middle of the night, there's some shit going on down there, but  it's all...  They're, like, punks.  Yeah.  Punk-ass punk motherfucker.  Everybody's buying weed now, like, really, coke and heroin and stuff like that.  It's not really hot and popping like that in New York now.  I mean, for the most part, people that do sell weed, it's just, you know, to make up 
[01:38:30]  for what they're not making at their salary.  I mean, you know, at their job and stuff.  But, nah, I don't mess with none of that stuff no more.  Like I said, I got a good paying job.  I've been here 17 years.  You know, I have no problem where I'm working at.  So, you know, it's just...  You know, sometimes when I hear you guys talk...  I mean, Andy cracks me up all the time, you know, when you do the whole racial thing.  I agree with 90% of everything you say.  I'm like...  Yeah.  It's that 10%.  What's the 10% you don't agree with?  We lose him again? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, his phone is awful.  Gary?  He does have a horrible phone.  It doesn't...  His phone doesn't fade out.  It just gets disgusted and turns off.  That's all right.  90% he agrees with what you said.  Yeah.  But the 10% he doesn't would probably get you killed.  Yeah, that's the hard part.  That's the doozy stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the real stuff.  And one Lulu after another.  Fucking learning about Jimmy today, man.  I didn't realize how deep you were in it.  Well, it's had some hairy situations, but, you know, lucky for me.  With the crack, I didn't know that. 
[01:39:30]  I didn't do as much crack.  I was more smoking that at the very end just to do it, but I still preferred alcohol.  It was mostly alcohol?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, a little boozing.  Yeah.  Like boozing a little bit.  I do.  A little bit.  Any of the other guys get clean from the old days?  My one buddy who reminded me of that horrible song I would sing recently, he got clean three  months before I did.  And he still is, I think.  So that's, you know, October of 86 for him.  Oh, look at the teens in Philly.  They're just having fun.  Oh, the teen trouble.  Yeah, teen trouble in Philly. 
[01:40:00]  None of them will address it.  No.  Except, in my other one article on Twitter, I did tweet a link to a good article.  Philly's mayor, yeah.  Philly's mayor.  Philly's mayor is great.  He went off.  He's black.  He's not afraid.  Pull your fucking pants up.  He's like, no one's going to give you a job.  Black people, honestly.  Home your hair.  Black people are the only people in this country.  I'm not saying they're always right, but they at least address race and talk  honestly about how they feel about it.  Black people aren't fucking politically correct pussies.  Only sometimes. 
[01:40:30]  Come on now.  There are so many black people that just play the blame game.  But at least, again, even if they're playing the blame game and I don't agree with it,  it is.  But at least they're being honest.  This is how they feel.  Even if they're wrong.  Oh, oh.  So honesty on how they feel, all right.  They're mentioning race.  That I'll agree with.  So, okay, I don't agree with them.  I think they're playing a racial blame game.  But at least they're saying, this is how I feel about this racial thing.  They're not fucking cowards who are hiding and pretending it doesn't exist like these  fucking white liberals are.  Yeah, I thought you meant honesty in what they're talking about. 
[01:41:00]  It's honesty in what they believe in.  Whether it's right or wrong, they'll say it.  Where white people, for the most part, will believe one thing and just keep it fucking  hidden to look like the fun, nice, liberal guy you are.  Well, the conservatives, Fox is phony, too, with race.  But blacks are not afraid of seeming racist.  They're not afraid to say something and be misconstrued as racist.  For whatever reason.  Maybe that's because they're not as penalized as you could say, but so what?  You know, black people aren't penalizing white people.  White people are penalizing white people. 
[01:41:30]  This is a fucking 80% white people's problem.  Yeah, I know.  And fault.  Just fucking be honest.  That's it.  I did, and I got some recognition on a certain website over the weekend.  I was trolling it around, and I saw my name in one of the topics.  I'm like, oh, let me click on this.  Oh, boy.  And it was actually the rant.  Fucking tell us it like it is.  Oh, believe me.  There was a couple of like, hey, this guy.  It was the rant that Drew Boogie used to make Bowling for Behave. 
[01:42:00]  So it was a whole, I guess it was almost 20 minutes long, but you could hear the certain  parts where he took it out and put it into the song.  Be honest.  You got a fake account, and you submitted it.  No, you know what?  Honestly, I've never subscribed to it because I think that would get me in a jam up.  You know, I could go visit any site I want, but I think if I became a member, there could  be some trouble.  You know, whatever.  I read.  Hey, speaking of Washington Square Park, this guy knows way more than certainly I do. 
[01:42:30]  He says it's full of methadone zombies.  Washington Square Park.  Yeah, I don't really walk through it as much.  I walk around it to the cellar, and you can hear always yelling by the chess games.  There's always some fucking hollering.  It's a cool place to check out.  Yeah.  Up to a certain hour, you're okay.  Like, I probably wouldn't go past one or two in the morning, even though you might be  okay.  There's always cops around there, but.  Yeah, you would be stupid to try to fucking either sell or cop drugs in Washington Square 
[01:43:00]  Park.  Right?  Yeah.  It's almost, I mean, whatever.  All right.  Hey, people are backing up.  We got Bob Kelly here.  Is he here?  And we got, yes.

[01:49:00]  and fucking both my feet go out from under me i land on my fat flack samoan back  i make the fucking biggest splash noise ever and my there was a sharp rock and my ass hit the rock  my whole left side of my ass is just black and blue and it hurt and it was so cold you know when  you get into cold water your heart just so i couldn't even scream i couldn't yell i just went  cold water it was awful so i made my way over to a bank if i made a fucking splash like that stage 
[01:49:30]  falling in indiana that's kind of funny that's a good visual five kills good this fucking eight  trout dead it was like fishing with dynamite after i went in the water just trout just started floating  to the top we get it all right then  it's like a tsunami so you fell in how embarrassing did the other fly fishermen 
[01:50:00]  immediately looked around nobody saw me fall in thank god but i walked over to this bank uh across  the river and uh there was like a muddy bank with all perfect for fly fishing it was so perfect and i'm  i threw my my line out it's coming down i looked down at my feet and um it's just like 30 paw prints  like big cat or big bear paw it's not a dog it's not a fucking lab it's that fucking ford you know 
[01:50:30]  those four dots pads on the bottom and then in front of them you get the the needle holes from their  claws going like six inches six inches deep into the mud i'm not a i'm not a fucking cherokee indian  but you knew it was some shit i knew it was something and i'm standing like right with it  and it was fresh as shit it wasn't dried up yeah it was wet like my footprint and that footprint had  the same color he had just been there just been there and i'm standing there and i'm like fuck and 
[01:51:00]  there's no way out there's no way out because i'm on the other side of the river and you know you ever  try to run through water you look you just wind up looking like an old person doing aerobics  you know just and then stop and you know a cat would oh i'd be a cat's delight it's either get  eaten up on land or get drowned by the animal in the river you'd be the stuff that you'd be like  the legendary story that they talked about animal generations down the road how long did you eat  for three years 
[01:51:30]  it was when our land flourished it was a gift from our cat gods they sent this slow-moving monolith  the cats would worship like a statue of me  so you think it was a mountain lion and not a bear  well i went i don't know i'm like i said i'm not fucking half india i don't know  it wasn't a dog i know it wasn't a dog it was bigger yeah i think it was a mountain lion i talked  to the guy down uh at the fly fishing place he was like it's probably a mountain lion a lot of 
[01:52:00]  mountain lions up there but he's like i've never had a problem i go yeah of course you don't because  you live here the fat guy from out of town is the guy that gets eaten yeah yeah they're the guys that  tell the stories yeah the one day that guy out of town yeah the one day my wife talked me into  fucking going up there if i got eaten by if i got bit by and and mauled mauled something happened i would  fucking dump my wife oh imagine bobby with no fucking hands yeah they ripped his balls off and  ate his face yeah there'd be a fucking song you know i broke my face dude you guys would make you

[01:54:00]  i wanted to tell everyone you know love everybody that you're with because you never know  this big long pontificating bullshit at the end  but i try to be funny at the end like  love everybody you're with except mountain lions  kill those motherfuckers  yeah romey kelly's first time back ladies and gentlemen  takes me 20 minutes to get off the stage  i used to be really fat  but i can't eat cake anymore  because my wife won't tape the forks in my hands unless i'm eating lila beans 
[01:54:30]  i used to be really fat but the cat ate most of my stomach  bad things are good don't feel sad for me  sometimes you gotta shit in your bag  but it's okay  i got my health down  i got my friends  yeah because anyway my push comes to shove  i'm still here  i'm the same person  i didn't need my soul  you know what dad 
[01:55:00]  so what i don't like kids anyway  so if they scream when i walk by  it's okay dad  my wife left me after the accident  i caught a fucking sucking jim norton off  yeah he was making chip noises  she was just giggling  that would fucking kill me  that's my nightmare  oh man  that would be so horrible  so you didn't stick around obviously  i said fuck that shit  fuck my fly fishing  what really fucked me up was the you know the grass 
[01:55:30]  yeah  it was all bedded down  oh fuck  like something had just you know gone through there  yeah  that sounds like bear  i don't know dude  it was fucking creepy  it was  and those fucking people that live there  i hate  you know  like when i went to maui  and they're still like  yeah don't worry about it man  there's tiger sharks  but they don't  shut the fuck up  but they don't  they don't  and then i find out  they found a torso  a week before i got to maui  on the beach  right on one of the hotel beaches  yeah  fuck off  and they eat turtles  that's their main fucking food 
[01:56:00]  me in the water  oh yeah  turtle  yeah i hate the locals that are like  you'll be fine  yeah i've never had a problem  fuck off  yeah  i don't want to be the first problem  you never had a problem  because you're here  right  like that proved  the people that had the problem  aren't here to tell me  they didn't have a problem  because they're fucking dead  right  i don't mind going out there  if i have a knife  a big knife  i'll fight a beer  i'll fight a fucking mountain lion  i'd do it  if i had a what  a mountain lion  with a knife  i love how you say that 
[01:56:30]  everyone would  not everybody  what's your other choice  some of those broads  just lie there  and take it  you know what i mean  it's always the husband  that has to step in  i've seen the i've survived show  and they have bear attacks  every so often  and it's people that  uh  know that  they just gotta  kinda hunch up in a ball  protect the back of your neck  and just sit there  and let the fucking thing  like bite at you a little bit  no  and then  because that's the only way  you're gonna live  yeah but what  what kind of patience does it take 
[01:57:00]  as soon as you get that first bear claw  of course you're gonna do something  that's just it  but if you fight it  you have to take a few bear claws  do you understand that  yeah  if you start trying to fight it  you're not gonna win  but as soon as you feel that first bear claw  you realize  i have to now do something  no you're supposed to  no i know you're not supposed to  but  have the discipline to just  who the fuck has that type of discipline  put your hands up over your head  and just kinda curl up  and lay there  that's what you do  after all your sexual encounters  yeah  cause then  it will go away  relatively quickly  for you  it'll seem like  18 hours 
[01:57:30]  but it'll be like  just  a matter of seconds  logically  you have to lay there  knowing you gotta  take a few bear claws  yeah  there's not a human being alive  that's able to do that  there's one story  about a guy who got  did we say this on the show  the guy who got bitten  and he got  the bear  bit him a little bit  and then the bear went away  and then the guy sat up  he got up  and the bear was still watching him  from across the field  charging out of like a locomotive  and fucking plowed into him again  another guy had a gun  he shot the fucking bear  a couple times  the bear just was like 
[01:58:00]  well fuck you  yeah they say pepper spray  is better  really better  you need like a  Smith & Wesson 500  right to the head  right to the fucking head  that might do it  if you're carrying around  a 9mm  yeah but it's hard to  I mean to shoot something  it's hard to shoot  there's something charging at you  you can't just  the crisis  hold on one second  prediction to fail  yeah  our favorite persons on Fox  Kreskin  I didn't say this before  Kreskin  and I hope 
[01:58:30]  Rogers listening out  you're now mentalist  for years  I made my decision  for the prediction  October of last year  I announced in Vegas  and I suddenly pulled back  and says no  if I can think of what happened  60 years ago  he's gonna pull out  because the best man  the Republican Party  could have today  months ago  is Mike Huckabee  the trust  the conviction  I travel the country  I pay no attention  to polls  because polls are fickle  when I was a kid  a man was running  against President Truman  and his name was Dewey 
[01:59:00]  when I was a kid  and all the polls  said Dewey's gonna win  and the next day  of the election  they held up  the news  really  the Tribune said  Dewey wins  and Truman had won  it said  Dewey defeats Truman  you dumb fuck  and say Dewey wins  and Mike Huckabee pulled out  for a beautiful reason  you should say  does he  or did he  Dewey?  I don't know  I don't speak good English  this is not more  in broadcasting  than as president  and 60 years ago  the most powerful man  in the history  of this broadcasting industry  everybody's forgot  Edward R. Murrow 
[01:59:30]  Oprah couldn't approach him  was Arthur Godfrey  he decided to run  for president  Bernard Baruch  and Elder Stephen  said Arthur  was he babbling about  he used to do our show  until we just openly  laughed at him  and he has his accent  Pence slams him  in his book too  I think  oh really?  good  Chris is a joke  including  the raising of the salary  of the servicemen  the public doesn't know about  were all quietly done  by Arthur Godfrey  Arthur Godfrey  the guy that used to sell  his film  he's not gonna run 
[02:00:00]  and he did the wisest thing  I think he decided  he could do better  so who do you think  is gonna win  Kreskin where's your  big fucking prediction  so you picked one  and you say people  will be surprised  by the way the vote goes  yes they will  yes they will be surprised  the way it goes  why do you take him seriously  and by the way  I don't think there's gonna  God forbid there's a crisis  I think it's gonna be  pretty much stable  oh fucking wow  we used to do our show  do you have any more  fucking show breaks  you want to throw on  Jesus Christ  that was the fucking  we were having the  funnest conversation 
[02:00:30]  about being a dying  let's listen to the Kreskin  for eight minutes  sometimes they work  sometimes they don't  what can I tell you  what can I tell you  I wish a bear  and a mountain lion  were in here right now  and ate your hand  no you don't  you don't understand  the history  with fucking Kreskin  he used to come in here  and have TV makeup on  and he would make  these ridiculous predictions  and then go  I gotta run  because the press  is waiting for me outside  and we would follow him  out there  and there'd be  no one waiting for him  yeah where's your  press conference  and he'd go  I can't say  who keeps that a secret 
[02:01:00]  it's a press conference  right  yeah  I do that  so  Kreskin  with his dumb handshake  too right  what's his handshake  isn't he the one  that's very firmly  really hard  it doesn't let go  no it's an obnoxiously  hard handshake  I hope he does it  to this guy  are they wrapping up  the segment  because if he shakes  this guy's hand  you'll see what an  obnoxious old fuck  he is  it didn't work  but I mean  I wish the mountain lion  got me  he loved us 
[02:01:30]  he did our show  but we couldn't  we couldn't go  with it anymore  it was all hack shit  so hacky  remember his dumb tricks  with the book and stuff  oh yeah  his assistants  it's sad when you find out  I was on the Montreal  Just for Laughs tour  last year across Canada  they had a magician  on the show  or a pickpocket magician  and he was  no seriously  a fucking amazing  like crazy  Puerto Rican  he was amazing  and then I found out 
[02:02:00]  that the last show  that it was all  a fucking scam  like the people  that he got  oh yeah  they're plants  right  yeah  I didn't know  though  I thought he actually  took the suspenders  off the guy  with the  somebody wanted  magic  just pinched  Bob's little cheek  by the way  Penn  have you seen  Penn and Teller Live  I'm a huge fan  of their show  bullshit  but I've never  seen them live  except on TV  I saw the show  when I went to  Vegas in December  with my ex  they were  fucking great man  like there's a couple  things they do 
[02:02:30]  that I  you know it's a trick  because they're telling you  it's a trick  and a couple of you  they show you how  they're doing it  and they don't show  the guy on stage  who they're doing it to  they're great  it's the best magic act  he's walking down the hall  and now watch  now he's going to go  after Kreskin  and then it's going to  all make sense  Bobby  you watch this  because he fucking  hates Kreskin  you want to move  no stay  no stay  I do magic act  by the way  it says grizzly bear  is indifferent to man  has no fear  a man will attack you  if he feels like it  yeah  the best thing to do  is play dead  he'll rarely sustain 
[02:03:00]  his attack  if you play dead  remember he's very big  and the weight alone  can kill  I wouldn't fuck  with a grizzly bear  no not you Penn  I wouldn't fuck  although  you look like a grizzly bear  holy shit  probably similar  hey Pendulet everyone  we just went to the TV  I fucked up a pretty good  rap that was happening  on our show  but still  Kreskin was on  the dumb fucking TV  we hate Kreskin  Kreskin was on  what is the name of your TV  and we know you're not  a big fan of Kreskin  I read some of the book  what is the chapter 
[02:03:30]  there was one chapter  with Kreskin's name in it  yeah asking him to sue me  you know  it's amazing  when I was  12 years old  or something  you know  Kreskin was on  some TV show  and it wasn't Carson  you know that  because Carson  would not allow  the stupid fuck on  right  that was an absolute  Johnny Carson rule  a little stupid fuck  Carson was really  pro-science  as a matter of fact  Carson was a skeptic  and gave a huge amount  of money to the  James Randi society 
[02:04:00]  and Carson would call me up  about bullshit  you know  he was a real fan  wow  huge into astronomy  he also  he also talked  Carson talked privately  a lot about being  an atheist  but always felt guilty  he didn't talk about  it more publicly  so Kreskin was on  some show  some jive-ass show  Mike Douglas  let's say Mike Douglas  just for fun  and he was demonstrating  his ESP kit  his science kit  with the ESP cards 
[02:04:30]  and this pendulum  that did  idiomatic  micro-idiomatic movements  you know  you think something  and the pension  it starts moving  and I was really  into science  as a child  and my parents  I'm not from  a wealthy family  I'm from  western Massachusetts  a dead factory town  so buying stuff  was a big deal  my parents would  buy stuff from me  if it was science oriented  so they bought me  this piece of shit  ESP kit  thinking it was science  right  because I'd seen him  do this experiment 
[02:05:00]  on TV  you know  experiment  and I was into science  and then because  my sister's  23 years older than me  and had already moved out  I was raised  essentially as an only child  so my parents  would have to sit  and do this  piece of shit game  with me  and we did that  because you know  I took it seriously  you know the kind of guy  I am  so I'm taking like tallies  and other kids  just throwing the pendulum  around and shit  but I'm taking tallies  and doing it carefully  and then like  a few weeks later  I'm in our public library  which I went all the time  and if all of us 
[02:05:30]  are familiar with  the Dewey Decimal System  800's pure science  absolutely  right around  the juggling books  and when I say books  I mean book  because I was  juggling a lot then  were the magic books  you know  and I take out  the juggling book  and I was working  on all this stuff  I took out the magic book  and there was a book  I think by Dunninger  on mental magic  he was a big mentalist  in the 40s and 50s  huge star on radio  and so I'm thumbing  through the book  and there in the magic book 
[02:06:00]  is the exact same trick  that Kreskin had done  and how to do it  and it wasn't science  it was a bullshit magic trick  and because I was 12  maybe not  maybe because I'm psychotic  but let's say  it's because I was 12  I completely flipped out  and I dropped out  of all science  I hated science  I wouldn't go near  I was embarrassed  in front of my parents  I was miserable  I was horrible  it was terrible  was it because you  at that point  had thought  science was a gag 
[02:06:30]  at that point  I thought  well scientists lie to you  scientists lie to children  why should I be involved  with them  and I hated magic  because they were part of it  and the whole thing  and it wasn't really  until I was 18  and met Teller  and Amazing Randy  that I turned around  so I wrote this story  for a skeptics magazine  about how much  I hated Kreskin  I said because  you might think  he turned me on  to skepticism  but he didn't  he just stole money  from my parents  and stole time 
[02:07:00]  and love  from our family  that's why  the chapter is called  maybe that thief Kreskin  will sue me this time  so I get this letter  and this is when  I'm living in New York  remember I'm living in New York  I'm on Broadway  right  I'm not married  I don't have children  and my parents  are both alive  and healthy  okay  all of that is important  and I get this note  from Kreskin  saying  from Kreskin's attorneys  saying he's going  to sue me  and I  just got 
[02:07:30]  rock fucking hard  I was so happy  because now  I could  bring forth  all this vengeance  from my 12 year old self  and just go crazy  so I call my lawyer  and I go  Kreskin's suing me  I'm suing  he says  I'm sure we can get out of it  I go  we don't have to get out of it  this is very very exciting  I want to be sued  I want to take him down  to Chinatown  this will be fucking great  and so I tell him  you know  the New York Times  v. Alabama  civil rights  nothing compared 
[02:08:00]  to what I do  I've got so much  fucking money  I've got nothing  to spend it on  let's use it all  to take down Kreskin  so my lawyer  writes this  note saying  first of all  you can't sue  Penn and Teller  because it was only  Penn that said it  and second of all  any reading of this  means he didn't really  mean you broke  into the house  he means that he  disagrees with you  and the lawyer  of Kreskin  writes back  and says  okay  we won't sue you  so I call my lawyer 
[02:08:30]  and go  what do you mean  he won't sue me  he's got to sue me  and he goes  Penn you can't force  someone to sue you  so then  just to make  how much  I'm getting a little  carried away  please forgive me  I love it  so we cut to  about 10 years ago  I guess  we're living in  Vegas  and Debbie Reynolds  has a hotel  there  the Demi Reynolds  hotel  and I'm friends  with Carrie Fisher  and I've also felt  Debbie Reynolds breast  which is a whole  other story 
[02:09:00]  very good story  and I'll take a little  I was at the  porno awards  we want to hear this  I was at the  porno awards  and I'm there  with Nina Hartley  and I'm there  with Al Goldstein  and a few other  people  and Gina Fine  and Nina Hartley  comes over  and I'm sitting  at a table  that also has  at it  Carrie Fisher  and Buck Henry  and Nina Hartley  comes over  and says  Penn do you like  my new tits  and I go  very much so  and she says  feel them  so I feel 
[02:09:30]  I feel her tits  and they're wonderful  and then she leaves  and Carrie Fisher  turns to me  I'd never met her  Carrie Fisher  turns to me  and goes  would you like  to feel my breasts  I've been in  legitimate features  and I said  yes very much so  so I feel  Carrie Fisher's tits  which incidentally  greatest  fabulous  unbelievable  breathtaking tits  Princess Leia  and that's fantastic  what year  what year was that  this would have been  I don't know  90s sometime  alright fair enough 
[02:10:00]  maybe early 90s  fabulous  and then  later on in Vegas  I got together  with Carrie Fisher  and we went over  to her mother's casino  and she said  you know  you should meet  my mother  then Debbie Reynolds  came out  and Carrie Fisher  said you know  Penn  you love to tell  stories  you're good  at telling stories  and you should  fill up my mother  because that would  be a great story  for you  and she said  so mom  can Penn  feel your breast  and Debbie Reynolds  goes and feels  each of her breasts  and chooses one  and then says  yes feel this one  so I feel 
[02:10:30]  Debbie Reynolds  tits  and I tell  this story  on the radio  in some  you know  dog fuck town  good morning  dog fuck  was the name  of the show  you know  starring dog  and fuck  I go on  the show  and I do  all these  incredibly  unpleasant jokes  but then  one point  during it  I go  and you know  I felt up  Debbie Reynolds  because she's  a friend  they got more  hate mail  on feeling up  Debbie Reynolds  than they'd ever  gotten on anything  so be ready 
[02:11:00]  be ready  our people  will hate you  because you  didn't kill her  so Kreskin  is playing  the Debbie Reynolds  hotel  okay  and  Teller  me  a couple  of show  girls  or show  I don't know  what the plural  is  I guess show  girls  I thought it  was maybe  show gaggle  or something  and Lance  Burton  and a juggler  named Michael  Goodo  who also  writes on bullshit 
[02:11:30]  gang out of  the warriors  and then  the final person  was the  topless  bull rider  from one of the  shows  woman was there  with us  and we all  pay full price  for our afternoon  tickets for the  Kreskin show  because we're  going to go see  them  and we go in there  and we sit down  and the show's  supposed to start  at like 2 in the  afternoon  and there's  nobody there  people get tickets  with the buffet  and stuff  and the show  doesn't start  it's like 10  minutes late  in Vegas  shows start  right on time  so you can gamble 
[02:12:00]  and so we're  sitting there  sitting there  and finally tell  them I decide  we have to pee  so we get up  and we go  we piss  we come back  and the maitre d'  says you're not  allowed back in  I said excuse me  and he goes  Kreskin has said  you're not allowed  into the showroom  he will not start  as long as Penn and  Teller are in the  showroom  and I go  well we haven't  been disruptive  you can tell  we're not drunk  here are our  receipts  we have the tickets  we're going in  he goes I'm sorry  I can't let you  go in  and I said well  then you better  call Metro 
[02:12:30]  because the police  are going to have  to take us out  and now I'm all  excited  because now  not only am I  in a lawsuit  but also I get  to go limp  it's like I'm  in Birmingham  and I tell Lance  Burton call the  local paper  and bring  photographers in  because I want  pictures of Penn  and Teller being  taken in handcuffs  out of the Debbie  Reynolds theater  by a guy who's  going to do  card tricks  this would be  fabulous  and we sit  there  and you know  I have never 
[02:13:00]  heckled in my  life  I'm not disruptive  I mean here  on the show  I'm loud and  aggressive  that's my  fucking job  you invited me  on  if we were just  out hanging  out  I'm not going  to heckle  or something  but I am going  to sit there  full of hate  but he will be  able to detect  that psychically  but there won't  be anything out  there  so now we are  20 minutes after  his show is  supposed to  start  and let me  tell you  let me tell 
[02:13:30]  you what this  guy does  he walks out  on stage 20  minutes late  with his head  kind of down  and kind of  sniffing  and he says  I want to  apologize for  being late  today  my mother  97 years  old  is in the  hospital  it was kind  of an  uncomfortable  time  and I just  got a call  and thank god  she's going 
[02:14:00]  to be okay  and the audience  applauds  now there is  a chance  there is a  chance  his mother  was really  sick  and if his  mother was  really sick  you know  I was very  close to my  mom  I lost  my mom  my heart  goes out  to him  but there  was also  a chance  and I don't  know the fact  there's also  a chance  he was lying  and if he  was lying  fuck him  in the neck  that's all  I got to  say  and fuck  his mother  for taking  partners  so that's  that's 
[02:14:30]  that's my  little comment  about  that's a hell  of a story  do you think  and by the way  about grizzly bears  I don't want to  interrupt you  a friend of  mine was in  the geological  survey  and he was  going up to  go through  Alaska  and when you  go through  Alaska  the geological  survey  bears are an  important thing  to know about  so they all  have to carry  44 magnums  right  and as they  walk through  the woods  you want the  bear  bears are very  nearsighted  so you want  them to know  you're human  so if you're  human they  won't fuck  with you  so what you're  supposed to do  is go through  the woods  singing 
[02:15:00]  and talking  as loudly  as you can  and if the  bear comes  at you  you're supposed  to point  the 44 magnum  at their heart  and you're  supposed to  talk really  loud to the  bear  because it'll  probably turn  around  and it tells  you  and this is  so stupid  it tells  you in the  U.S.  Geological Survey  handbook for  bears to have  something memorized  that you're ready  to say to the  bear  so my friend  Wheeler who's a  geologist  I have a lot  of friends  who are  and if you're  geologists  listening  my favorite 
[02:15:30]  joke is  Moe's hardness  scale but  Moe of the  three stooges  and not Moe  the geologist  so it's Moe's  hardness scale  a finger  two  I four  but that's not  important  if there's a  geologist  listening to your  show they think  it's funny  Moe's hardness  got Moe  you got any  specific gravity  bits  not many  but I'll work  them up  so Wheeler  says to me  I have to  memorize something  to say to the  bear  you have to  have it  memorized  because people  choke  yeah  it's hard to  improv in front  of a bear 
[02:16:00]  Nixon buying  dope on the  subway  go  so you're  supposed to  hold the  gun out  and I said  there's only  one thing  you say  Wheeler  and that's  the bear  is coming  at you  you hold  the 44  and you go  I know  what you're  thinking  bear  that I  fire five  shots or  six  because to  tell you  the truth  and all  the excitement  I've kind  of lost  track myself  but since  I'm holding  a 44  magnum  most powerful  handgun  known to  man  blow a  bear's  head clean  off  you gotta 
[02:16:30]  ask yourself  do you  feel lucky  well bear  do you  in Alaska  that's what  you're gonna  be doing  and the bear  would have  to respond  I gots  to know  I love  how that  guy goes  man  I gots  to know  do you  think that  when you  talk to  Carson  do you  think that  when  Uri Geller  he kind  of fucking  Uri Geller  got kind  of ruined  it seemed  on Carson  he did  yeah he did  do you  think that  was Carson  kind of  happily  sabotaging  it  oh no  no  it's a  beautiful 
[02:17:00]  beautiful  story  Uri Geller  was big  for a minute  there  you know  in the  70s  and they  were pushing  to get a  booking  on Carson  and Carson  said no  no  no  no  no  and then  Uri Geller  got big  enough that  Carson  said yes  and Carson  immediately  called James  Randy of the  Randy Educational  Foundation  JREF  on the  web  called Randy  and he said  Randy this  fuck  Uri Geller  is coming  on  what do I 
[02:17:30]  do to make  sure he  can't scam  anybody  and Randy  gave him  a list  of things  and one  of the  things  was  which I  loved  Geller  I'll have  to do  all this  probable  stuff  because  Geller  is very  litigious  and I  do not  want a  monkey  with  Geller  so let's  be very  careful  allegedly  sometimes  it's  possible  that  Geller  has a  fellow  named  Shippy  who  allegedly  possibly  sometimes  comes  into  shows 
[02:18:00]  that he's  doing  allegedly  possibly  sometimes  as  like a  maintenance  guy  or  something  and he  is there  where he  could possibly  if Uri Geller  does not  have real  powers  possibly  facilitate  some of  his  what could  be called  possibly  tricks  so  Randy  says to  him  make sure  nobody  gets on  the lot  that day  so  Carson  goes to  security  himself  and he  makes  badges 
[02:18:30]  with a  Polaroid  that are  signed  by Carson  and says  on that  day  anyone  who gets  in  without  this  badge  you guys  are all  fired  no sir  I don't  see your  name on  the list  no sir  your name  is on  the list  and Carson  says  I mean  if you let  me on  without  this card  if you let  me Johnny  Carson  without  this card  your ass  is fired  no one's  on this  lot  so  allegedly  supposedly  from the  story  which I  didn't know 
[02:19:00]  directly  first  hand  this  particular  asshole  or may  or may  not  have  been  with  Erie  Geller  showed  up like  six  times  maintenance  guy  sound  guy  catering  he  doesn't  get on  holy  shit  Carson  also  says  when  Geller  comes  on  you know  I want  to keep  the camera  on you  instead  of on  me  so you  no one  can think  you're  doing  anything  tricky  but the  best  thing  he  does  is  Geller  allegedly  possibly  could  be  doing  switches  for  silverware  in his  pocket  switches  so there's 
[02:19:30]  a young  guy  there was  a young  guy  I guess  if that  was true  would  Geller  or someone  doing that  possibly  want a camera  on both  of them  to give  them a  half a  second  he  wants  very much  for the  camera  I mean  when we  do  any sort  of  chat  show  teller  insists  on a  monitor  that we  can see  so that  when they  do the  shot  over to  Letterman  we just  do all  the dirty  work  if you've  got to  do a  dirty  move  why not  do it  with  nobody  watching  is it  that easier  you practice 
[02:20:00]  it forever  and then you  say something  funny  camera goes  to Dave  oh  okay we're  done  you can  pull a  monkey out  of your  pants  at that  point  so yeah  you're  watching that  monitor  and seeing  the camera  off you  so he  finds this  guy  and I was  going to  say young  guy  but a  guy my  age  so in  the 70s  young  guy  I believe  it was  Paul Gertner  who's about  19 years old  at that time  and Randy  puts Carson  in charge  of him  and Carson  and he was  a monster 
[02:20:30]  magician  just one  of these  close up  finger flinger  guys  young  and he  Carson  hires him  as a page  at NBC  and says  when Geller  comes in  you're in  charge of  making sure  he's happy  make sure  he's taken  care of  he's got  the whole  page coat  the whole  thing like  that  but he's  one of the  greatest  young  magicians  in the  world  who is  within a  foot of  Geller  all the time  he's watching  every move  and he's  doing stuff  like let me  take your  jacket  and we'll  send it out 
[02:21:00]  and get it  cleaned  get those  pockets all  cleaned out  and Geller  now needs  to get  allegedly  possibly  to do this  needs to  get rid  of Gertner  so he's  saying stuff  like can I  get something  to eat  and Gertner  goes sure  we have  anybody  any food  here you want  he goes  yeah I'd  like  can I  just get  some pizza  and Gertner  gets on the  phone  and Carson  had already  because of  Randy  set up  like three  guys to  work for  Gertner  to run  out and  get anything  just anything  so he's  saying stuff  like you know  I want  sushi 
[02:21:30]  but with  a pacific  and they're  just going  boom boom  sending people  all over  so Gertner  never leaves  man did Carson  have a hard  on for this  guy  this is a  great story  couldn't Geller  have just said  to him  could you leave  the dressing  I want  to be  alone  yes he  could  and he  would say  no  Mr. Carson  wants to make  sure you're  taken care  of the whole  time  so you can  watch this  clip on  YouTube  because Carson  does this  I mean he  almost sabotages  his old show  because Carson  just kind of  goes go ahead  do something 
[02:22:00]  Ed Geller's  coat's clean  he's got nobody  helping him  now it's possible  he had real  powers  has real powers  and this negative  energy is enough  to fuck anybody  up  I mean that's  the rationale  and that is  what he said  wasn't it  yeah absolutely  but nothing  nothing gets  accomplished  what didn't  happen  I just remember  vaguely it was  something to do  with cups of  water  yeah yeah  he was able  to tell  oh that's  thank you  you left out  part of the  I left out  part of the  story  this is great  he would do  this thing  with like 
[02:22:30]  canisters  like film  canisters  and one of  them had  water in it  and seven of  them didn't  right  and you'd mix  them up  and he'd be  able to divine  you know  I haven't got  the trick  exactly right  with the  numbers and  stuff  but that's  the idea  divine water  in a container  and the way  some people  who think he  doesn't have  powers think  he might have  done it  is to simply  be signaled  which is  simply  you know  you put one  of your guys  in the audience  he sees stuff  while you got  your back turned  it's a simple  to code anything 
[02:23:00]  from the audience  you look over  and he's touching  his baseball hat  it's you know  you don't need to  have too much  special coding  you can really  much hold up  a fucking sign  it's for  douchebag  but that guy's  not there  right  and Carson  mixes the  things up  and you can  see this  on the  recording  it's very  very funny  Johnny also  says to him  and put  put the  things on  a really  heavy table  because you  can find  other appearances 
[02:23:30]  where  if he didn't  have powers  which we know  he says he does  and there's  no reason  to doubt him  he does  bump into  the table  and of course  a table  when it's  jiggled  the heavier  container  won't move  as much  and somebody  who didn't  have powers  could figure  it out  the same way  well  Carson puts  these containers  on like  a solid  it looks like  a solid  chunk of  concrete  he's balanced 
[02:24:00]  them on top  of the  Washington  Monument  it just  does not  fucking move  building  cornerstone  exactly  and you  can see  him  banging  his  fucking  knee  against  this  thing  and you  don't get  Carson's  going to  hurt yourself  there  but this  is a solid  table  and Carson  keeps saying  which is the  thing that's  so  such a  wonderful  beautiful  thing  is Carson  keeps saying  you know  we're taking  all these  precautions  because if  you do 
[02:24:30]  these things  on my  show  no one  will be  able to  doubt  you  we're  trying to  help you  here  because a lot  of stuff  you've done  has been  sloppy  and this  is being  so careful  no one  can turn  against you  and he's  out there  and Carson  just lets  him fucking  die  Carson  wouldn't let  anybody die  if you're  sucking out  there  Carson  takes over  your spot  saves you  he'll throw  you anything  softballs  boom  Carson  would do  what's  necessary  but Carson  is just  sitting there  going  huh  so that 
[02:25:00]  would be  that would  supposed to  be bending  now  and Carson  is not  even doing  jokes  I mean  never mind  he's not even  doing mean  jokes  he's just  doing nothing  just like  okay  we'll give  him 10  minutes  of dead  air time  to fuck  up  so yeah  that was  the whole  thing  and it was  all randy  and you know  surrounding  with magicians  just great  great stuff  why didn't  Uri just  bail on  his appearance  at that  point  you know 
[02:25:30]  that I  think  knowing that  he's going  to fucking  fake illness  or say  he's sick  or something  he knows  he's going  to eat  it  I think  the answer  is hubris  you know  when these  guys  now I won't  talk about  Uri Geller  now because  of course  I don't  know  but people  that claim  psychic  stuff  it's amazing  the shit  that they'll  do  that they  can get  away  with  you know  they will  there's always  the chance  and this  is a really  good trick  they use  is spilling  hot coffee  in someone's 
[02:26:00]  lap  that's what  they do  to journalists  all the time  so the guy  goes  motherfucker  and then you  do your  little move  right  or they  always have  to piss  they always  have to  vomit  they always  have to  leave the  room  and you  can always  get lucky  you know  and one  thing that  psychics do  that magicians  don't do  is they're  ready to  get lucky  now if  I've worked  on a card  trick  and I'm  a magician  and I've  worked on  this really  clever way  to take  the cards  back  and do  a side  peek  I'm going 
[02:26:30]  to hold  the little  break  with my  finger  and then  when you  give me  the card  back  I'm going  to slide  it  and I'm going  to turn  my hand  and I'm going  to just  barely see  the index  you know  and I've  worked on  this slide  peak  in the mirror  forever  and I've  got it down  perfect  and I'm doing  the card  trick  for you  and I put  the cards  out  and you  pick the  card  and I'm  ready to  do my  side  wearing  glasses  and the  reflection  is perfect  and when  you hold  it up  I see  the card  in your  glasses  now a 
[02:27:00]  magician  does the  side peek  anyway  fuck I  practiced  it  but a  psychic  will just  take  any  opportunity  you get  and it's  amazing  the opportunities  you get  we did  this  bachelor  party  for  Steven Spielberg  I don't  know why  you wouldn't  want  hookers  why you'd  want  Ben and  Teller  but he  wanted us  to do a  seance  for him  we'd done  these  seances  years ago  and Spielberg  won  this is  back in  the 90s  so flew 
[02:27:30]  us out  from New  York  and he  had like  you know  the guest  list was  Harrison Ford  and Dustin  Hoffman  and everybody  was a superstar  like 12  people  and we  had  it was a  very  blasphemous  seance  it was the  real stuff  that the  seance  people did  with you  know  hailing  Satan  and all  this  stuff  really  creepy  stuff  all done  with magic  tricks  which we  said at  the beginning  all this  is going to  be magic  tricks  we're going  to play  it real  and we  had this  incredibly  unpleasant  trick that  we did 
[02:28:00]  where we  had all  these pictures  of atrocities  you know  horrible  horrible  the most  intense  SM porn  and war  atrocities  and all  this stuff  like 20  of these  pictures  right  and everybody  was supposed  to pick  a picture  that they  had the  strongest  visceral  reaction to  none of us  are going to  like these  pictures  but the  one you  have the  strongest  visceral  reaction  to  you  take  it  so all  12  people  take one  of the  pictures  right  and then we 
[02:28:30]  mix them  up  right  and then one  is chosen  at random  and then we  pull out  some blood  and stuff  and the  blood  coagulates  and forms  this thing  that says  dude 14  the audience  figures out  over forever  what it is  and they go  to the  Bible  they open  the Bible  to Deuteronomy  and it's  an exact  description  of how  this woman  is tortured  in this  porno  right  really creepy  creepy  stuff  and so  Teller and I  have this  move  where they 
[02:29:00]  all pick  their pictures  and then  I'm to  reach over  when I'm  doing it  and I  cop  the other  picture  the hero  picture  the picture  that has  to be  picked  okay  so they  handed all  their pictures  we've got  12  there's 13  there  because I've  thrown one  in right  and then Teller  has this  move  that he  has to do  where he  has to  be dealing  them out  and the  person's  going to  say stop  I'm making  it simpler  than it is  but for  understanding  and then  he's going  to do a  slide on it  and pull  that out  so that  the one  they're going 
[02:29:30]  to select  is going  to be the  picture we  need  and we've  rehearsed  this  it's hard  it's a  two person  move  it involves  social engineering  it's moving  around  social engineering  means you're  talking and  distracting to  yeah yeah  and you kind  of tell them  to do this  and tell them  to do that  and you're  handling them  and there's  all this  shit you gotta  do  and we  worked on it  forever  years ago  but we haven't  done it in  10 years  15 years  we're sloppy  we've run  through it  but you know  they've flown  us out on the  fucking private  jet  and we're 
[02:30:00]  gonna do the  move  and this is  the hardest  move in the  fucking  whole thing  and we're  kind of rusty  but the show's  going well  but it's like  two hours  and it's all  only 12 people  it's one on one  it's this intense  thing  and I gotta  come up  and do this  move  and you know  I know  we've practiced  it and counted  it and everything  and we turn  the pictures  over  and I give  the introduction  you know  we're gonna pick  one of these  pictures  and Spielberg  decides  I mean  to be a dick  is too strong 
[02:30:30]  a term  but he's just  he's having a good  time  he's playing  with his friends  and before I can  say we're each  gonna pick a picture  before I can say  we're gonna turn  them face down  to not embarrass  anybody  before I can do  like three minutes  of my fucking  setup  Spielberg reaches  and grabs one  of the pictures  and says  I want to use  this one  and holds it up  over his head  an absolute  nightmare  because now  I have to say  no no  I want everybody  to pick a picture  and then we'll  narrow it down 
[02:31:00]  fuck  jive  and shit  but I gotta do this  so now I'm flop  sweating and going  now I have got  to bully  I have got to bully  Spielberg  into doing this  and then make it  so he doesn't  remember me  bullying him  and I gotta get  all this stuff in  and Teller  is across the table  from me  so when he picks  up the picture  Teller can see  it and I can't  you know  and then he turns  the picture  toward me  and it's the  hero picture  and I go  that's the one 
[02:31:30]  you want to use  and you know  he's now cut out  the hardest part  of the whole trick  and he's made it  so that the rest  of his life  unless some  asshole gave it  up on the radio  the rest of his life  no matter  you know  he can talk  to Ricky Jay  he can talk  to anybody  that knows  magic inside out  and they can  never  you mean  you picked it up  you held it up  he didn't tell you  anything  that's correct  he didn't even  like say  he's  no  didn't touch it 
[02:32:00]  well he must have  touched you  you can't possibly  get it  he's told  and because  I'm a professional  I just went  with it  but because  I'm not that  much of a  professional  I make eye  contact with  Teller and  smile first  like  holy shit  yeah  holy shit  would have  struck a lot  sick of our  luck  if I were  really  if I were  really a good  magician  I would have  just moved  and I did  do all the  right stuff  I said  you want to  change your  mind  right  do you want  to change  your mind 
[02:32:30]  and I try  to push him  and make it  very clear  I'm trying to  push him to  change his  mind  so that he  won't  and he goes  no  I'll keep  this one  well do you  want to mix  it in with  some other  no  I'll keep  this one  so at the end  of it  it's an  absolute miracle  so the reason  you don't  cancel that  kind of  stuff  is you  can still  get lucky  so if you're  going to go  out on Carson  and he's  going to be  a complete  hard on to  you and  not give  you a chance  and the  table is  cement  and Randy  has talked  to you  and your 
[02:33:00]  dressing room  has been  cleaned out  you've still  got a chance  of getting it  by dumb luck  and if you  get it by  dumb luck  you are set  forever  because remember  the gamble  that Randy's  taking  and that Carson  is taking  and every  time we bust  one of these  guys that  we're taking  is that  if it's a  one to ten  chance  one out of  ten times  they're going  to get it  so you might  as well try  I mean if  you  if a guy  comes up to  you and says  oh you're  such a card 
[02:33:30]  magician  here's my  own deck  I've shuffled  it  no one has  touched it  you can't  see it  what's the  top card  well you have  two choices  one is you can  go well I  I can't do  that  anything you can  do is go  jack of clubs  with conviction  and you've got  a 52 to 1  shot of hitting  it right  and if you  hit it  if you hit it  there is no  way for the  rest of all  those people's  lives  you're anything  but super  and that's not  a bad chance 
[02:34:00]  you know  no you know  what  overall  and it is  I was on  what show  was I doing  I think it was  Carson Daly  I was on  there and  got incredibly  lucky again  where I was  all ready to  do this trick  and he just  named a card  out of nowhere  that I happened  to glimpse  was the bottom  card that was  in his hand  and he was  shuffling the  cards right  so he's  shuffling the  cards and he  flashes me the  bottom card  so I see the  bottom card  I happen to  know what it  is and he's  been shuffling  himself and he  puts the deck 
[02:34:30]  down and I'm  going to do a  whole different  trick I've got  like three minutes  planned I got a  trick planned  and I say to  him so name a  card and he  says seven of  diamonds and I  say I haven't  touched that deck  have I he says  no I said only  you've shuffled  is that right he  says yes I go  turn the deck  over he goes  seven of diamonds  total luck  and then he's 
[02:35:00]  just going I'm  not in on this  I'm not because  not all the  heat's on him  right right  because only he  knows it's a  great trick  yeah you know  what I mean  if I did it  for you  they'd just go  fuck me up  yeah yeah  so he comes  backstage and  goes listen man  how did you do  that I said I  got lucky  he went ha ha  how did you  do that  but I got  lucky  how did you  do it  how did you  do it  I got it  it was really  man level with  me we're off  the air now  I said I  got lucky  you flashed me  the bottom  card you  happen to  name it 
[02:35:30]  what are the  chances of that  happening  about 1 in 52  so you came  out your balls  are so fucking  big you came  out without a  trick and you  just hoped to  get lucky  no I came out  with a trick and  when I was lucky  I changed the  trick let's do a  different trick  then because it's  easy so you know  you uh that's why  you wouldn't cancel  you do a very cool  one too at the end  of the live show  uh or it's in the  middle or whatever  you and teller  where you hand  out books to 
[02:36:00]  everybody and you  guys guess what  page they're on  it's a joke  it's a joke book  I know the punch  line to the jokes  they're doing  it's a fucking  great like what  do they have to  give you information  before you know  what page they're on  I don't remember  exactly what is it  the audience says  to you I don't  I'm operating on  two levels here  because I know  what the trick is  but I have no  idea so I  exactly so I  could remind you  now of the trick  incorrectly  and make it a  better trick  what happens is 
[02:36:30]  they bring a  book from home  I've never seen  before  they open it to  any page they  want they look at  a whole sentence  they close the  book up burn it  burn it right there  in the theater  I say this only  exists in your  mind and then I  recite it back  but no none of  that happens  we hand out joke  books  and they go  through and they  pick a joke and  then through a 
[02:37:00]  series of questions  I ask them I  divine what joke  it is I do that a  couple times and  then there's a  prediction on stage  with a punchline to  a joke that a  person in the  audience is going  to pick and we  do it very very  much with a joke  book because we  just want to hammer  it home that it's  gag joke show  business you know  and I love the idea  that we're doing a  better trick than the  guys we're  communicating with  dead parents do  but we're doing  with a joke book  you know how  fat your wife  were you thinking 
[02:37:30]  about how fat your  wife is yes I was  but yeah that's that's  that's a trick we do  and that's you know  that's one of the  ones I'm really proud  of because when we  started doing doing  magic the old timers  would tell us you  cannot do mentalism  unless you lie to  people and say that  there are real powers  and you have to use  real emotionally  charged things and  I would say it's  morally wrong in a  light entertainment  to talk about  someone's mother  dying that's not 
[02:38:00]  right you know and  you know guys would  brag you know I did  this thing with this  guy we're talking  about that and I you  know I'm able to  bring up his mother's  middle name and said  she she loved him so  much the man the guy's  crying and they say  that is with pride  yeah and I'm going  you fucking asshole  you know this guy's  got all you've got  when when when a  loved one dies all  you've got is their  memory and the part  about this talking to  the dead stuff that's 
[02:38:30]  never discussed I  mean everybody  discusses well it  gives them some  comfort you know  but my mom and my  dad and my sister are  dead and I was very  close to all of them  and love them and the  most valuable thing I  have and I guess I  have to carve out my  children but it  doesn't feel that way  it feels it's more  important to me than  my children are my  memories of my mom and  dad and then some  prick comes out and  says you know I'm  talking to Valda 
[02:39:00]  Gillette I have I have  her I have her in my  mind here and she  says from beyond the  grave she's happy and  healthy and she's with  her cat and everything's  fine whatever he says  there is even if it  gives me comfort has  taken away some of the  real memory of my mom  and that part is never  everybody talks about  the money I don't care  how much fucking money  they steal from people I  mean that's a bad  thing but stealing a 
[02:39:30]  thousand bucks from me is  nothing compared to  stealing a memory of my  mom with that said did  you ever go after John  Edwards for for what he  does we we did a whole  thing in general but once  again on two subjects  more probably but I'll  give credit for two on  two subjects South Park  absolutely ate our lunch  and we did a thing on  talking to the dead and  we did our the best job  we could and went after  John Edwards and did what  I thought was a funny and 
[02:40:00]  heartfelt and intense show  and then Trey and Matt  came out and did their  John Edwards South Park  when people ask me about  that I go watch the South  party I mean ours is  really good but we were  creamed by the South Park  guys and the other thing  the other thing that got  me on was I was having  dinner with Trey and I  said to him yeah you know  we can't do we can't do  Scientology Showtime doesn't 
[02:40:30]  want us to do Scientology  they want us to stay away  from Scientology and Trey  Parker that prick not  only does the perfect  Scientology Show on South  Park but also says in  every interview you know  we did this because  Penn and Teller couldn't  they said they weren't  allowed to do it so we  went and did so for  Scientology and John  Edwards although I would  love to be the guy yeah 
[02:41:00]  bullshit I would love to be  the guy that did all of  these we did some very good  shows on bullshit we didn't  do any shows in our whole  eight years that were better  than South Park's John  Edwards show and with that  how does John Edwards do  all that shit give that  shit away you know this is  the basic the basic this is  the hard part of it there's  a there's a few things that  work with psychic stuff and  the reason you always have to 
[02:41:30]  be careful like when someone  comes to me and says I saw  John Edwards he did this how  did he do it I have to be  very careful because  sometimes you don't know  okay and you're going to  get very he's going to get  lucky but essentially if  you're doing a TV show you  shoot four hours and air a  half an hour and that's  really all you need to know  yeah to put psychic stuff  into perspective of a card  trick we've already talked 
[02:42:00]  about this if I go out in the  street and say take this deck  shuffle it look at one card  is it the seven of diamonds  you say no we go okay after  an afternoon of shooting  someone says yes I mean  that's the simplest way no  it's never done like that but  if you've got a one in four  chance you just shoot it that  many times so they do  questionnaires beforehand to  people before they go in who  are you trying to get in touch  with just fill this out on this  piece of paper okay once you've 
[02:42:30]  written something in any magic  act anywhere once you've  written something down on any  piece of paper assume it's been  published in the New York Times  the magician has it and it used  to be it used to be carbon paper  and now it's all radio fucking  controlled anybody that gives you  a clipboard there's no time  anyone uses a clipboard in the  21st century no one uses a  clipboard when you go to a  psychic show it's nothing but  clipboards because they know how 
[02:43:00]  to gimmick them so you get this  combination of stuff and then  you have to remember if I say to  you right now I'm gonna do a  magic trick I'm gonna do a card  trick you you tense up you're  watching me you're very very  careful you're a little guarded  on guard right the card down like  this but if you are grieving over a  dead loved one and you are  grasping for some hope and someone  comes in and says I get the 
[02:43:30]  impression of an M and you say well  her name was Deborah but we called  her mom and we you don't want to  debunk it and you get right right  you're giving them the benefit of  it's amazing people that have so  they're giving it up for you they  will of course they do and you know  it's that hope you have to be very  you have to be very careful to  never ever blame the victim you  can't say you know you listen to  these tapes and if you're cold 
[02:44:00]  hearted and don't think about it  being the guy's mother dying your  first thing is to say you told him  everything he tells you back you  told him when she was born where she  was born and then he just told it  back to you yeah how stupid can you  get it's not how stupid can you get  it's how much pain you can be can  you be in you know it's kind of like  saying you know that that rapist is  really good with women well you're  ignoring the gun you know that's an  important part I'm gonna take issue 
[02:44:30]  with that do you have you seen any  that were impressive to you that you  were like like even though you know  did it well yeah or that that  actually confused you or made you go  like huh uh or have you never seen  that there is the amazing thing about  there you know James Randi offers a  million dollar prize to anyone that  does something supernatural under test  conditions it's a million dollars  it's it's it's in the escrow it's  covered some of the money is mine  you just get that also if you do this  thing once you get you know you win a 
[02:45:00]  Nobel Prize pretty much you've changed  you've changed all the physics and  there isn't anything that's even iffy  anywhere yeah yeah there's just not  there's not one situation where people  go you know but if you understand that  I'm saying something different than I  understand how every trick was done  right because I don't understand because  I know you know you can have that  situation where you've got four hours of  tapes of a guy doing stuff trick trick 
[02:45:30]  bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit  bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit  bullshit bullshit and you know you're  bound to be right the story that I've  heard and I can't I can't substantiate  this but but uh uh this is hearsay but a  funny story John Edwards was playing  Atlantic City because you know if you  really care about people's loved ones who  passed away you're gonna be playing a  casino in Atlantic City that's the first 
[02:46:00]  that's all you need for the argument  right that's all he is he's playing a  casino because you know his stuff is as  important emotionally as America's  horse with no name and and he's in  Atlantic City and you all know Atlantic  City you know the audience and so on so  he gets up and one of the things he does  like I said this is hearsay I wasn't  there one of the things he does he says 
[02:46:30]  he's got an audience of 900 people and  he says I'm getting the image of Greece  this Greece means something to people  and uh you know that's there's a lot of  uh Greek uh Greek ancestry around  Atlantic City pretty safe bet yeah a  woman raises her hand and says my  mother loved that musical at which point 
[02:47:00]  John Edwards says no no I meant the  country oh but and then he covers it  goes back to that  holy shit that's that's the kind of thing  you can do you can just um if you're  opening your heart up I can tear it apart  of course we got Kathy from Long Island  she says uh you're dead wrong Penn oh I  Kathy go ahead Kathy's always good for  something there's no doubt I'm dead  wrong but what go ahead Kathy I've been I  went John John Edwards used to take his 
[02:47:30]  show in Manhattan and I had actually been  to his show twice um I was never read I do  have a friend that um was actually two  friends that were read by him during the  taping of his show there were never  clipboards there were never questions  beforehand the only thing I think you had  to resign had to sign with some form of  like a waiver or something like you know  allowing your image on television uh-huh um  but he never um asked questions  beforehand nobody ever asked you  anything you went in you sat it was like  a horseshoe kind of setting uh-huh I know  we all know the setting yeah yeah but um 
[02:48:00]  never there was never any pre-interview  really so you believe you believe he was  communicating with the dead that that's  the that's the movie that's only and I  and I do I've always been interested in  that kind of thing but I will say only  because I know the people that he  connected with sure and know that there  was no relationship of course of course  yeah no no of course and I would never  I would never question your friends  certainly weren't lying they certainly  weren't set up and I believe this  completely to be sincere all I would ask 
[02:48:30]  you is uh if there was a loved one who  had passed on why do you think they  would choose to go through John Edwards  instead of directly to the to the person  that they loved why why would that be  their choice because that's always been  a mystery to me I can't explain how the  trick was done because I wasn't there  and even if I were there they could have  also got lucky but just tell me that  because that you know I I'm a mama's  boy I was very close to my mom why would  my mom choose to talk to a dipshit 
[02:49:00]  instead of me well I think because for  lack of sounding totally cheesy it being a  gift or something like that how could how  would I don't think a person could come  directly through to me per se that's right  um point across as opposed to someone that  can visualize and vocalize it for me yep  can can I ask you something when you went  with your two friends right you're sitting  there before the show it doesn't normally  just start the second you sit down it must 
[02:49:30]  have been a very quiet time you three didn't  talk about anything while you sat at your  seats not a peep didn't say anything and  there's no chance that there could have  been microphones in a television studio  that could have picked up any discussion  anyone said about who they might hope  that they got in touch with no because  you know what um I can tell you that  specifically in my situation no obviously  I wouldn't know about other situations  right  my girlfriend was very quiet about it 
[02:50:00]  because she was so afraid and leery of  what she was going to hear she did not  what was she afraid of no no not afraid but  she she did she wanted to be able to say  that it was something that if it happened  for her that it was legitimate and we  there was no discussions of anything or  anybody that we were hoping pens a lot  nicer pens a lot more diplomatic than I am  I'm going to say for the record your  friends stink  those two dumbbells  because I don't believe that they talk to 
[02:50:30]  the fucking dead relatives on John Edwards in  my John Edwards is a carny it's my  opinion hey hey hey hey in my opinion in  my opinion I'm just saying carnies are  okay yeah don't shit on carnies like  that I believe your friend are dumbbells  yeah so you believe it it went down like  it went down yeah I do only because I  was a witness to it and they were both  actually on the television show yeah but  also um wait wait wait can I ask your  pen what did John Edwards say that got 
[02:51:00]  her and you convinced like holy crap he's  talking to her it was it was specifics  about her how my girlfriend sister's  health situation oh what were those  specifics what were those specifics I  can't I won't get into it on the radio I  wouldn't do that to her because but you  don't know the television  that was her choice well you're not  saying her name Deb we don't know her  name there's no connection to her we  don't have your last name we don't know 
[02:51:30]  her name so you're not breaking her  anonymity or confidence at all because  we have no we don't know who she is but  you do understand that people who die die  of something so it's a very safe bet to  go for an injury or to go for a to go for  disease or an illness and you also know  that there are there are tables of of  what people are most like to die on and  you also know when you're looking at  someone you get you get a reaction from  them if you talk to try an experiment for 
[02:52:00]  me Deb just next time you're next to a  stranger like on a bus or a train or a  plane instead of thinking when you're  talking to that person about what you're  going to say next or how you want to  present yourself or what you're trying  to do try to find out how much you can  find out about that person just by  listening the way they handle  themselves the way they look what their  rings look like what their jewelry look  like and you'll find out that if you pay  attention to other people instead of 
[02:52:30]  yourself this might be one of the only  good things about this if you're not  thinking about what you're going to say  next and if you really watch people  they will give you a huge amount of  information and one of the things that  people do is every time this is  burlesque people do people do a whole  thing like you know did they die of hard  cancer brain I see a leg injury I see but  it's not ever done that grossly but if 
[02:53:00]  you are talking to someone that I've  watched hours of tapes of people in  psychic readings as I'm talking right now  to you and I look over he's nodding he's  doing these he's doing these big as I'm  speaking yeah that's the way human  beings talk to one another and unless  you're trained and trained is important  to not give up stuff you do very much  give up things just by people looking at  you I would also say and this is this is 
[02:53:30]  the thing that is so hard to communicate  to people I don't know what you do for a  living but whatever you do for a living  while you were doing that and learning  that and studying that guys like me were  studying how to trick people and one of  the things you get is very smart people  like doctors will come to you and say  they'll see our show and afterwards  they'll go you know I'm a smart guy and  I watched that whole show and I couldn't 
[02:54:00]  figure it out you must have had a plan in  the audience because I couldn't figure it  out and I go well I'm not a smart guy but  I'm an okay guy and I study stuff too and  yet if you were in the middle of doing a  vasectomy I could not walk in and take  over and that and that and that hundred  hours you spent learning to chop the right  exact right millimeter out of that cock 
[02:54:30]  that's the amount of time I spent learning  to find your freely selected car and you  have to remember that just because you  can't figure it out does not mean it's  supernatural this goes to a lot of this  unidentified flying objects UFOs there's a  lot of stuff I can identify and that  doesn't automatically mean it's from  another planet right yeah so the fact that  something happened for him to be able to  tell you things that you can't figure out 
[02:55:00]  how how he got the information doesn't  necessarily mean that the only choice is  that the dead were talking to him it's  possible there are other stuff so all I'm  saying is I don't know as an answer you  don't know does not automatically mean  supernatural and I will just say to you  and this important thing to remember you  do know for a fact that people lie you do  not know for a fact that the dead come  back and talk so if you have to choose 
[02:55:30]  which one that is you might want to go  with one you've had experience with and  just leave open the possibility just leave  open the possibility one that the soul of  someone you love very much chose to  communicate with somebody in a studio in  New York on TV or also possible in the  same list of possibilities you were  dealing with a lying sack of shit  I mean just give me that  not to each his own then right 
[02:56:00]  not to each no no no no exactly the  not to each his own no I will leave  open the possibility that someone can  communicate with the dead if I see  evidence but please leave open the door  just to crack that someone might have  lied to you in a very malicious and  terrible way and why do they just as a  possibility it's not because I want to  believe one thing and you want to  believe another but let's together say  that there are many things we don't  understand and we always have to factor 
[02:56:30]  in malicious love of money is one of  reasons Kathy as the dummy I got to ask  you this why why does John Edwards talk  in a vague way to get to the answer if  he has this superpower well he's very vague  and then finally has the answer  in my situation it wasn't vague well  with my with my friend situation was  it was this was this aired yeah yeah  and if you watched it since um probably  not in a couple years I mean yeah why 
[02:57:00]  would you if if you know so if someone's  talking to the dead yeah I would watch it  every fucking day  every day there's a miracle we spoke to  the dead why do you just throw it in  with the rest of your dvds and I also I'll  get to it eventually again you know the  time that uh someone talked to my friend  from the grave watch that first he's off  like he was huge for a second like on  everywhere and now he's kind of  disappeared is because he's a scared 
[02:57:30]  because he was gonna get caught I no no no no no he  wasn't running away but these things go in  cycles I think one of the things that  hurt him and when we were pitching  bullshit we pitched it two weeks after  9-11 so I was going into these places  pitching a skeptical show after the you  know the biggest tragedy on American soil  and it was weird because although it was  an appropriate show because we should be  skeptical of rabid believers especially  after we saw what rabid believers can do 
[02:58:00]  the the horror they can they can bring  about um it still felt wrong but I  remember going into uh a few of these  places and saying um I said you know I'm  not I'm not psychic I have no powers I  don't believe in any of that but I'm  gonna make a prediction this is two weeks  after 9-11 I'm gonna make a prediction  that um is just from experience that you  may not believe I predict that within six  months John Edwards will announce a show 
[02:58:30]  where he is going to talk to the dead of  9-11 oh my god and I said when he  announces that show you people in this  room I was pitching this to uh the studio  that had John Edwards of the the network I  said you are going to feel awful because  you were part of this horror and I'm gonna  sleep okay because I at least told you to  try to tell the truth and uh and uh they 
[02:59:00]  all thought it was too intense and I think  it was like four months later wow John  Edwards announced that his next show was  going to be talking to the dead of 9-11  he actually did and uh I remember some of  the people we did the pitch for called us  up and went holy fuck and instantly the  whole country turned against John Edwards and  he pulled that show back he never did it he  just announced it uh and I think that was  kind of sort of a slight turning point for 
[02:59:30]  John Edwards the beginning of the end  there well you know I just think that uh  the there's there's a certain kind of  proof that people aren't at a certain  level believing it that they're just kind  of watching it and saying it's possible  and this happens to my friends and it's  kind of trying to figure out how he's  doing it and we're kind of we're kind of  having fun with it and maybe it's making  these people feel better and then there's  a line now once again if America really  was stupid like Hollywood thinks they are 
[03:00:00]  uh and America really was believing John  Edwards hook line and sinker when he  announced he was going to talk to the dead  of 9-11 we would all be woohoo thank to be  able to communicate with these people that  would be wonderful and the fact that even  people who watch the show thought it was  in bad taste shows that some part of them  when they're watching this show is going  I don't know I'm buying that shit yeah  yeah Otto's been on hold for forever  Otto I apologize Otto from Otto and George 
[03:00:30]  goddamn how you doing Otto and we know  you're a big fan so we wanted Otto to  call in today what's up Otto good morning  hi Otto you know one of the things that  since we have since we have Otto what are  the thing when people do uh possessions  and regressions and past life regressions  you know I've always thought that they  were as a friend of mine um Jamie and  Swiss a close-up magician said all these 
[03:01:00]  people are are just ventriloquists but  not very good because their lips move I  would love to see you possessed by the uh by  the spirit of George and George you know  you should do a whole act where George  dies comes back from the dead that  possesses your body it speaks with you  yeah um well yeah I'm actually um I'm  actually doing seances to talk to a dead  relative it's a hundred bucks and to talk  to him while I drink a glass of water it's  a hundred fifty

[03:03:00]  you both took it together and wanted no  part of me  no of course I was in the photo between  them it's a very rare get  I saw the bullet catch show you guys did  years ago we still do the bullet we  can't we have to do the bullet every show  yeah it was it was like when you like  first started doing in Boston I think I  saw yeah yeah yeah it was just the whole  show is amazing I loved it we got to get  him out really fuck that fast why is 
[03:03:30]  rolling rolling you suck why are you  throwing Penn out five minutes we have to  plug the book which by the way I have to  I can't wait to read I've read 50 pages  of it and it's fucking great man I mean  you're a great writer and I had a bunch  of stuff great storyteller you kidding me I  loved uh let me say I I love this stuff  on Sigrid Sigrid and Roy well you go out  it sounds like you're gonna be shitty to  them and then all of a sudden you just  give this glowing loving talk it's very  funny about what they are as superstars I  thought it was really touching you know 
[03:04:00]  the the thing about Sigrid and Roy that  that that that that killed me you know  when I first you know it's so easy to  make fun of right me the Sigrid and Roy  the easiest guys in the world to make fun  of but um but there was a sincerity you  know you show up we would go to these  like charity functions you know you got  to show up to show you get better Roy  Horn oh well no we got his head bit off  by a fucking time you know you don't get 
[03:04:30]  better you know I mean that night that the  night that that happened it was so you  know telling I came off stage and I had  been I'll just say I was at Ringling  Brothers Barnum Bailey greatest show on  earth I was around these tigers and lions  and I terrified of them terrified of them  terrified of them and uh I would like when 
[03:05:00]  when there was anything going to be done  with a tiger I would like hide in the  other room and close the door because  you don't know I mean even if you have  the tiger trained you don't know if your  tiger happens to be the Charlie Manson of  tigers every every living thing goes  crazy you know what if the elephant you're  on is you know Ted Bundefent you know what  if that's what if that's his particular  mental illness you don't know I'm not an  elephant shrink or if he's down syndrome  and so you know I would say to I would 
[03:05:30]  say to Roy you know I would say to Roy you  do the nuttiest thing in show I mean like  the old time lion tamers we before our  time like Frank Buck and in in our time  Indiana Jones hat and the whip yeah chair  good to Gable Williams yeah I'm training  the beast and he would he would do this  thing that I thought was insane and I  talked to Roy about this all the time  which was you're doing something so 
[03:06:00]  dangerous and so impossible and you're  playing it off is no big deal oh these  are just and no one else in show  business does that you know they're  always going you know he's an amazing  guitarist he plays an e-chord you know  no one's ever done this before no one  never even realized that yeah they took  that element of danger out of it and  made it look like they're friends with  these cats they trained him to do all  kinds of the most abstract thing you  could do you know the whole idea of of 
[03:06:30]  we're not even going to play up the  most important part of it so when when  it happened you know we get off stage  and I know Roy was where I was attacked  and tell him I rushed over to the  hospital and then this crazy thing  happened I mean I'd gone on I always  make jokes about Siegfried and Roy I  always trashed him I always you know  contrasted our show with their show was  all of this but I also you know they  were a team and they invented magic in  Vegas and kind of off off my bluff was 
[03:07:00]  called because when I when I got there  Bernie their manager said to me you know  none of us want to talk to TV or radio  and we're all in in the room with Roy and  we're all too broken up would you do all  the press stuff for us so all of a sudden  I'm the one that had all the reports of  the doctors and stuff and CNN is calling 
[03:07:30]  and I'm on there and you know interviewers  are going didn't you make fun yeah what  all the time you know and it was just  this real clear idea of what showbiz is  yeah I'm fucking with you I'm making  fun of you but now we get real yeah and  I and I and it also because I have done  things on stage that look dangerous  nothing that dangerous someone getting  hurt is is is horrific no matter what 
[03:08:00]  but this is really close this is another  magic team where one guy was fucked up  and their show was over yeah that was it  and so I was there for like all night  and all the next day and doing all this  and and watching this whole thing but  what amazed me about Siegfried and Roy was  just the level of pure honest heartfelt  show business I mean if Siegfried and  Roy were still working and I came on this 
[03:08:30]  show and did shit about them fucking  tigers and you know did stuff that was  slightly slightly slightly uh gay type gags  and made fun of them and trashed them and  did this whole thing we could trash them for  a half an hour and I could bet my life  that um the next day on my voicemail would  be a call from Siegfried going I want to  thank you you are on the opie Anthony show  thank you for mentioning our name thank you for  absolutely every time without and then I would 
[03:09:00]  show up you know to do these like charity  things red carpet stuff you know and I show up  in jeans and a fucking t-shirt you know and I'm  walking down the red carpet they're taking  pictures and you're waving and then I walk up to  Siegfried and Roy and they're wearing like you know  yak dressing gowns and tuxedos they're all about it and their makeup is perfect and their hair is perfect and you know at first you think well how fucking stupid and pretentious and did it does that and then I would just stand there going now which one of these people is doing their job 
[03:09:30]  how many people are going I really want to see a guy walking down the red carpet looking like he's here to fix the toilet that's what I want to see I want to see a guy in jeans and t-shirt you know but uh so I really I really love them you call them superstars and you said what superstars that made them seem like it was that was a great great chapter and there's also a great chapter on that and I know he's leaving but uh about uh very religious Jews uh who have had experiences with you 
[03:10:00]  where they're kind of uh questioning God and uh it's it's a really fucking great book whatever it is so much thank you I can't wait to read it Penn you're always a great guest you know what you can do right now to be a great host you can actually read the title of the book god no god no signs you may already be an atheist and other magical tales I think a lot of people are gonna pick this book up man or download it at least download because a lot of bookstores are closing so if you can't get in a bookstore just just just grab it on your we only mentioned the book once that's all you that's all that's not good

[03:14:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:14:30]  We're going to thank Penn Jillette once again for coming by the show.  It's Penn Jillette on Twitter, and I'm going to do this because he doesn't believe we were going to do this.  His new book is called God No Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales.  Jimmy's halfway through the book.  He absolutely loves it, and I can't fucking wait to read this one.  Penn's great, man, to just sit and listen to. 
[03:15:00]  He's so fucking insightful with shit and just has such a great way of putting things like,  God damn, that's exactly what I was thinking, but had no way how to actually present it to people.  He's logical.  Very logical in how he handles things.  I'm a huge fan.  I just sit there and just listen to him.  I wanted to talk so bad, but I had nothing to say.  What kind of person does it take, if it's true, by the way, because I just learned from Penn Jillette, 
[03:15:30]  you got to be careful with this shit, that John Edwards was actually pitching a show  where he was going to talk to people that died in 9-11.  He's marvelous, John Edwards.  What kind of a fucking person does that fucking take?  How do you sleep at night?  I know.  If that's the case, because I, you know.  Oh, he's magical, that man.  I wouldn't want to tinker with him.  He talks to the dead.  He frightens me.  I haven't had trouble with live people. 
[03:16:00]  What is that?  Is that a new character?  I don't know Helen.  Why did you ask?  Helen.  That was almost like Helen.  I like when Penn hits on something and goes, that's all you need to know.  He's got 20 more layers of how to explain something.  Sure.  But there's something so simple like, and he's in Atlantic City.  Right.  Because that's all you need to fucking know.  Or the woman that, like, didn't watch the fucking tape of their talking to the dead.  Why wouldn't you watch that every day?  Every day you'd be going, this is the day we spoke to the dead. 
[03:16:30]  I don't even care if I know it word for word.  I would still have to watch it every day because it's just the most amazing thing that's ever happened in your life.  It's a miracle.  Ant, really quickly, because he brought up the Johnny Carson thing, and you know more about Johnny Carson than me.  The Carson.  Did you see the Uri Geller thing he described?  Yeah, I saw clips of it.  And what?  He just completely bombed?  Yeah, yeah.  Get on.  His excuse was that he was feeling ill, he was tired, there wasn't the right vibe, like he had some kind of weird... 
[03:17:00]  And maybe that's the way, maybe that's the truth, who knows?  Well, that was the excuse he used on the air.  Yeah, maybe that's real.  And maybe that is true, if he does indeed possess such magical power.  I don't know if he does or not.  Because everyone wants to see this now, so...  Yes.  Now, I remember when that happened, I was there, I was helping out.  No, you weren't.  I almost don't believe in his beard.  Wait a minute.  Where's the Carson clip?  It's on here. 
[03:17:30]  Okay, oh yeah.  Can you turn it this way, Sam?  And also, yeah, Chris in Rhode Island before we get out here.  Johnny's smoking.  God, the fucking 70s.  Wait, Johnny's actually smoking as he's hosting the show?  Johnny's got his cup of coffee, he's probably got vodka in it.  Orange jacket.  All right.  Holy shit, why is it...  Probably a chick blowing him during the show, under the desk.  Yeah, it didn't matter.  Dude, everyone is trying to be the next, you know, late night talk show host.  Fucking go old school and say fuck it and just start smoking.  Holy smoke, drinking.  People will talk about you.  Wear wide lapel jackets. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Call yourself...  All right.  You get it.  I stopped, yeah.  Would you welcome, please?  Yeah.  Uh, Geller.  Now that Peng explains something, he's going to be fascinated.  Yeah.  Would you welcome...  It was good hair.  He's been a magician himself and was skeptical.  I was asked to help prevent any trickery.  Nice to see you.  Thanks.  We, uh...  We have only met...  This scares me.  This scares you?  Well, this is...  We've got some things together here.  Yeah.  I'm glad to provide their own props and not to let Geller or his people anywhere near them. 
[03:18:30]  Also, one of our staff members, uh, did some drawings which have been sealed in an envelope,  uh, and I'd like you to take your own pace when you feel like you want to try anything.  Do you want to try that particular experiment first?  Well, no, feel free.  When you, huh?  Sure.  Oof.  We'll start eliminating the ones that do not have the water.  All right.  Without touching them.  Ah-ha.  He's waiting his hand over them.  Without touching them.  I'm having a hard time with you. 
[03:19:00]  I don't mean to be, all right?  I really don't.  No, no.  Just, just keep looking.  Okay.  Let me rest a little, all right?  All right.  Oh.  Thank you.  You know, I'm surprised because before this program, your producer came and he read me,  please, 40 questions you're going to ask me.  Well, I can ask you all kinds of questions if you'd like me to ask you questions.  I have to have time.  And, uh, um...  Wow.  Is he bombing. 
[03:19:30]  Wait.  This is more to come for Carson.  Wow.  His back smoking.  God, we were back.  Your furry was telling me you don't feel, what, strong tonight?  I don't feel strong.  It's not all tonight.  Right now I'm feeling being pressed and then I can't...  Well, I'm not trying to press you.  I really not.  No, you're only telling me, well, will you try that or that?  Well, I thought that was the idea.  Wow.  I thought that was the idea.  I'm not going to put you down.  Oh. 
[03:20:00]  Much to my surprise, the Tonight Show episode didn't have much effect on Uri Geller's career.  Huh.  Mm-hmm.  Neither did the book that I wrote about him.  But eventually, his star faded.  Why people are so drawn to the irrational is something that has always puzzled me.  James Randi.  I want to be, if I can, as sure of the world, the real world around me, as is possible.  Now, you can only attain that to a certain degree, but I want the greatest degree of control. 
[03:20:30]  I don't, I've never involved myself in narcotics of any kind.  I don't smoke.  I don't drink, because...  What do you do?  ...that can easily just close the edges of my rationality, close the edges of my reasoning  powers, and I want to be as aware as I possibly can.  We're all in our 40s.  You're giving up a lot of fantasies that might be comforting in some way.  Well, it goes on and on.  It's a very long clip.  Yeah, the Carson clip is great, though.  He just is...  Johnny actually lays his chin on his desk, and he's looking at him like, yeah, go ahead, 
[03:21:00]  show me something, asshole.  Go ahead.  It's so uncomfortable.  You got a hard on for him.  So uncomfortable.  I have a hard time watching that.  Even if the guy's a douche, you're like, ah, turn it off.  He's on the Tonight Show.  Just turn it off.  The Carson's Tonight Show, bombing.  Yeah, only three channels back then.  Only three fucking channels.  Everybody's watching, Bobby.  Everyone watched Carson, Bobby.  Yeah, he actually had to get up and turn the channel so nobody did.  How many million do you think that was back then? 
[03:21:30]  Take the country, divide it in three.  That's pretty much it.  No cell phones, no internet, nothing.  They had no way to distract themselves.  Get in here, he's on!  Because if you didn't see it then, you were never seeing it again.  That's why, what's-his-name goes, surprisingly, it didn't affect his career.  Yeah, that's odd.  Because you bomb on Johnny Carson, that usually is the end of you.  There was no pausing it.  You know, hurry up, the commercials are over.  You can boo the Negroes out the window later, he's on. 
[03:22:00]  Look at that, I bombed on Carson Daly.  You didn't bomb on Carson Daly.  Oh, I fucking did.  I know you did.  Let me tell you something.  We were watching it at the Cellar and they don't have the sound on, so I was like, thank  God, they don't play the sound at the Cellar.  And then the stupid closed caption guy wrote, on my first joke, light laughter.  Oh, shit!  Light laughter.  Even the guy watching it.  Smattering.  What a douchebag.  Yeah.  That's funny.  That was very funny.  I remember that.  Just write laughter, you fucking idiot. 
[03:22:30]  Bobby's coming back tomorrow because, you know, we had a great start with you and then we  moved into Penn Jillette, so Bobby's coming back tomorrow.  Penn's a great guest, man.  He's unbelievable.  He really is a great guest.  We don't get him often, so, man, you get him in here and let him go.  But so is Bobby.  So is our Bobby.  Oh, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  What are you promoting, Bobby?  This Thursday.  I'm going to be, oh, I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  No, you go, Jim.  This Thursday, I'm going to be at Bridge Street Live in Connecticut.  Nice.

Because I'm bald.  What are you playing?  Baseball and hockey or something?  Edgy.  Ugh.  Fucking.  Fucking.  What was that word you said?  Down syndrome a fan or something?  Because he, see, it was a play on the, he had said something about a Manson elephant 
[03:23:30]  or something?  Yes.  Physically made me ill.  As it should have.  It just was the fucking worst.  I was, I'll be in Utah this Friday, Saturday, and I'm on Red Eye Tonight on Fox.  Nice.  Doing Red Eye.  Utah, Wise Guys, the big room.  The comedy shindig.  Yeah.  In Utah.  I've never been there.  I've got a lot of emails requesting I come there, so I'm going there.

You're going to have a good time.  Utah, what am I getting, Mormon or something? 
[03:24:00]  No Mormons go to the shows.  Ugh.  Check out my podcast came out today.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  How did they do that?  Go to gloryholeradio.com.  And my podcast, Jim Florentine's podcast is up there, too.  Podcast?  Podcast.  It's a podcast.  My brother, who knows a little bit about geology, says that geology joke was really  funny.  I had no idea.  He goes, dude, that's a funny fucking joke if you know geology. 
[03:24:30]  Stop touching me.  Did you understand that at all?  A geology joke.  From Penn Jillette?  No, I assumed what it was.  Right.  But where was the funny in it then?  Yeah, geology.  What was the joke?  I don't even know.  I got it, of course.  I couldn't even paraphrase what he said.  I just smiled like I got it.  Like I was following it.  That's a geology joke.  Eh, hilarious.  You might as well have been talking Chinese at that point.  I had no idea where I was.  And my geology friend.  Yeah, let's end the show with Tony Sunshine. 
[03:25:00]  You might ask, who the fuck is Tony Sunshine?  Hey, I was talking to Tony Sunshine.  He's pretty bright.  He did this for the show.  For the show.  Another song about the good boy fawn and the naughty boy fawn.  Which my manager just says wrong now.  Good wa-foon, not a wa-foon.  It's not, that's not right.  No, he's just so obsessed.  It's not the proper way to do it.  This is what Tony Sunshine did with Jim Norton's little song.  Bobby, we'll see you tomorrow.  Bye, bye.  Bobby!  Bobby!  He got a good boy fawn and him not a boy fawn. 
[03:25:30]  He not a boy fawn and him good boy fawn.  Good boy fawn and him not a boy fawn.  He not a boy fawn and him good boy fawn.  Little him, he got a good boy fawn.  So he can book a gig with Jim Norton's little Yimmy got him not a boy fawn.  So he can call a tranny when he's edging all alone.  And Anthony has got him good boy fawn.  So he can get the call from Kenny early in the morning.  Anthony, he got his not a boy fawn.

This is After ONA Live.  He was your host, Sam Roberts.  You know it.  Woo woo woo.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:27:00]  I'm Sam Roberts.  They got out of here.  I mean, Opie did talk to management for a little bit.  I saw him.  He talked to management a little bit before he was able to get out of here.  But he got some things off his chest.  Not a hostile meeting at all.  And could be productive.  So I don't see any problem with that.  But they're gone.  Opie, Anthony, Jim.  We're all still here.  Jim will be back.  Jim will be back here?  Mm-hmm.  Today?  Yeah.  Why? 
[03:27:30]  Jeff Bridges.  Oh, Jeff Bridges coming in later?  Yeah.  That's a big star.  Performing.  Performing what?  He's an actor.  I have his new country CD.  Oh, so that's why he's coming in here.  Yeah, performing.  He's got to promote his music.  Well, I mean, still, Jeff Bridges coming in here is a huge gap for Sirius.  I mean, that's pretty amazing.  You didn't have anything to do with that, did you?  No, no.  Not this time.  Because he doesn't wake up early.  But can you talk about your big one that you have coming in tomorrow?  Which one?  The big one that we have tomorrow. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  Well, I think the plan is for O&A to go a little later tomorrow, which I'm sure all of you  are really upset that it's going to run into an hour after Open Anthony Live time.  I know.  We'll all have to get over it together.  But yeah, Ron and Fezzin turn over there with the things on his arms.  We've talked to him before.  What's your name again?  You could just yell or say it.  Spanky Frank.  Spanky Frank.  Yeah, Spanky Frank is a little upset about it.  But we'll all get over it together because Joel McHale tomorrow, live in studio on the 
[03:28:30]  Open Anthony Show.  Jim and me got to talk to him at Comic Con.  And even then, he specifically, we didn't even ask him about it.  He specifically mentioned that he was excited about finally coming back to the show.  Look, the guy's been a little busy lately, hasn't he, Roland?  He's been, yeah, real busy.  And now he's doing Spy Kids 4, which that reminds me, because we talked about it at the  beginning of the show.  Why did you get Opie and Jim to go see that movie?  You're laughing now, Roland. 
[03:29:00]  No, it just...  Opie and Jim went to see...  What was the movie called?  What's Your Number?  Comes out September 30th.  Okay, so the movie is What's Your Number?  And I know I've seen the trailer before.  I saw it, you know, if you go to movies, you've seen it.  And if not, look it up on YouTube.  It's just the typical chick flick romantic comedy where some girl is trying to find  the...  She won't have sex with another man until it's the man of her dreams.  Well, actually, you're wrong.  It's the Cosmo quiz where each girl has a certain number of people to sleep with. 
[03:29:30]  And then she ends up...  Yeah, if you sleep with more than 20, you'll be single for life.  And then it's her friend who lives...  Or her neighbor who lives across the hall who sleeps around a lot.  Who's helping her find her ex-boyfriend.  She ends up talking to and helping her through this as a friend.  Helping her find her 20.  Obviously, they get together in the end.  I don't know.  And they get married and everything.  They stop each other's whorishness.  But why on Earth?  Joel McHale is in this movie for apparently... 
[03:30:00]  I haven't seen it.  But apparently five minutes.  That is a blatant lie.  How many?  Six and a half.  Six and a half minutes.  And your pitch was...  Hey, Joel McHale's coming in to talk about Spy Kids 4.  That's the family movie.  But he's also doing this movie.  You guys should come see it.  Making Opie and Jim think that this had anything to do with what Joel McHale was doing here tomorrow.  It seems to me like you were going to see a chick flick and wanted some company.  Nah.  I love seeing a chick flick.  There's a private screen room. 
[03:30:30]  But why did you get Opie?  I understand why you went.  Because you like the movies.  Why did you trick Opie and Jim to see him?  I didn't trick him.  I said, this is a movie.  I really...  Wait, wait, wait.  Eric, did you just hear Roland's quote?  He said, Roland...  This should be isolated somewhere.  Roland just said, I didn't trick him.  I said, this is a movie.  Yes.  There is no debate.  Eric, was there a debate as to whether or not it was a movie?  A movie, no.  As for who was starring in the movie, yes. 
[03:31:00]  Yes, that was the debate, Roland, as to whether or not it was at all necessary for them to see this.  Well, I mean, literally, the movie company told me, hey, Joel McHale's in it.  I saw him in the trailer.  His name is, like, second name in the movie.  I didn't realize he's only in it for that short of time.  I figured at least half the movie he'll be in it.  Did the movie studio trick you into getting the guys to go, or did you just realize, I'm going to see a rom-com.  I'd like to have my pals Opie and Jim with me.  Well, Jimmy hit the chip throughout the whole entire movie.  Well, why would you bring Jim to that movie? 
[03:31:30]  Well, I invite everybody, because I always invite everybody, and he goes, I'll go.  I'm like, all right.  Because he probably thought that it had at least a tiny bit to do with what we were going to be talking about.  Well, we can mention the movie.  Joel McHale.  Yeah, we can, but why would we?  He's only in it for six and a half minutes.  Yeah, well, I didn't realize that until when he disappeared and she goes, where did you go?  Where did you go?  That's your chip?  Yeah, that's my chip.  I love it. 
[03:32:00]  Because she was having sex, and then he goes, I hope she's wearing protection or something.  I love your chip chippers.  Eric, you're a big fan of chip.  Did you just hear Roland's chip?  I heard it.  Who do you think is better, chip or Roland?  Yeah, it is.  You can't tell the difference.  Your yellow shirt looks like you're the sun.  Or something, right?  Or something.  So, um...  Yeah, but I enjoyed it, and Jimmy, unfortunately, had an emergency meeting and had to leave the movie halfway through.  A jerk-off meeting. 
[03:32:30]  He had to go home and masturbate.  Yeah, well, he left the theater going, argh.  So, when did you realize that Joel McHale was not coming back on that movie screen?  Uh, when she says, I'm done with you, I was like, oh no.  Oh no, what have I done?  I was like, well, maybe he'll come back and fight for her.  And tell me this.  He didn't.  Were you more, uh, uh, worried that you were going to get a thrashing, or were you happy that you were proven right today because Anthony said he likes bridesmaids? 
[03:33:00]  As everything here, once you have a right, a wrong always appears.  Right, because the last thing they want to do is give you credit for anything.  You go, hey, Sam, that was a great pick, but oh yeah, remember that other thing?  Dick in the ass?  Dick in the ass.  Yeah, no, no, this one, I was cringing when I was watching the movie just because I could feel them going...  Pat and the rolling dick in the ass?  Yeah, and I heard up, you go...  Well, did you watch the trailer? 
[03:33:30]  You had to know they weren't going to like it.  Well, I love rom-com, so I thought, do you know what, if Joel's in it through the movie, it'll be funny.  Okay.  And then once she said, I want to see you again, I was like, oh no.  Well, uh, speaking of Chip, we should play this again.  Derek put this together.  Chip Chipperson had some phone sex.  Right after we play this, um, I heard a commercial when we went to, when ONA went to break.  I heard a spot announcing our next contest, which I was fairly unaware of, and I know hasn't been brought up on the air yet. 
[03:34:00]  So, and I just got copy for it.  Is it a Troy Anger Management Contest?  No.  No.  But I have some questions, uh, about this.  It's, it's a little disturbing.  This is, uh, Chip Chipperson, though.  Roland was just talking about him.  What does Chip sound like, Roland, so the people know?  He sounds...  No joke or anything?  Like, what would Chip say about, uh, like, my hair?  What's your hair?  Something, did something, did you put your finger in the light socket? 
[03:34:30]  What is the...  I don't know.  You don't know.  You hear, I think, I'm not sure if it's where the blockage is with you.  If you hear things differently than the rest of us, or if you...  That is correct.  Or if things sound right in your head, and they come out of your mouth differently than you expect...  I'm gonna say both.  There's a lot of mystery going on with Roland.  Um, but speaking of Chip, Derek put together a little song, uh, of Chip having some phone sex. 
[03:35:00]  You're gonna make Gary happy or something.  Play clips.  It's the sensual side of Chip Chipperson here on After Open Anthony Live.  Check this out.  What's up, baby?  You wanna get some dirty talk going?  Yeah, that's it.  I'm gonna give some cyber sex.  I'm good.  I'm gonna lay your back or something.  And I'm gonna lick all the way down your neck like this.  I'm gonna take my tongue and just go like...  I'm gonna clean out your ears or something and get waxed on my tongue and then lick all the way down your neck. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, that's a nice, dark nipple.  I wouldn't mind getting some nook out of that.  And then I'm gonna get my tongue and I'm gonna start licking it all over your nipples so much that you start cumming.  You're gonna cum so much that your shoes are gonna make sloshy noises.  And I'm gonna get down there and just start licking your fucking cooter really good. 
[03:36:00]  I'll just, I'll open up your cooter.  I got, I got like long nails on my middle fingers.  So I'll dig my nails into your cooter lips and I'll open them up and I'll just go like...  And I'll get in there until you cum so many times or whatever.  I'll stick it right in you too.  I'll climb right up on you like you're a building or something.  I'm gonna climb on like you're a tree or something and just cram my oats in you.  Someone put a finger in my ass.  He's got a way with words, that Chip Chipperson. 
[03:36:30]  And if you want more from Chip, you can see some of his Comic-Con adventures.  He was interviewing people at San Diego Comic-Con this year.  That's at youtube.com slash chiptvshow.  That's where you can get Chip at TV.  But my problem, and Eric, you were in there when the spots were playing, I think.  Am I right?  Are we doing the Bobo dating game?  That apparently seems to be happening.  I have the spot if you want to hear it. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, let me hear the spot because when it plays sometimes during the commercials,  sometimes people kind of mentally tune out or they turn the volume down.  Yeah, explain to me what this is.  All right, here it is.  Hi ladies, Bobo here.  It's the dating game with an Opie Anthony twist.  As you all know, I'm single.  That means good news.  So sign up today and you can win a date with me and $1,000 cash.  The Opie Anthony show is looking for female contestants to participate in our very own dating game.  If you've got the guts, send a current photo and short paragraph from why you might be Bobo's dream date to Opie Anthony at SiriusXM.com. 
[03:37:30]  Get closer with triple tested quality Trojan bearskin condoms.  Trojan, America's number one most trusted condom brand.  For official rules and details, visit SiriusXM.com slash the virus.  Oh my God, we're really doing it.  It's almost like a hooker.  You're paying the people to take them.  It's not at all like a hooker.  There's no sex involved.  It's just that you just go out with Bobo.  Bobo's not going to get any action out of this, Roland.  You and I both know that nobody that goes on a date with Bobo is going to want to give anything to him.  That's true. 
[03:38:00]  You know what I mean?  Like it's going to take a lot more than this.  But yeah, apparently you girls, I should sign Jess up for this.  Eric, do you know if Jess is eligible or is that out of your department?  Um, we, I think we could bend the rules if we want to put her in there.  We could get Jess in here, right?  Yeah.  I mean, look, the Robert Spencer household.  You're technically not family.  You know, you're not married, so she can't participate.  The Robert, the Robert household could use the cash. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, you buy like a nicer TV.  She doesn't work here.  You're not related.  I think you're good.  Matter of fact, let's see if, is Travis around?  Because I need some clarification on the rules.  Maybe Rob Cross.  All the rules are at SiriusXM.com slash the virus.  That's SiriusXM.com slash the virus.  If you want to, uh, uh, you know, submit an application, you have to send an email and  write a little paragraph about why you want to date Bobo.  I'm assuming for most of you ladies that the, the key here would be the thousand dollars 
[03:39:00]  that you'll win.  And I'm assuming you don't have to spend that on the date, but I thought Bobo was banned  from the show.  Or why don't they just write three words, a thousand dollars, send.  What happened to Bobo being banned?  I thought he was totally off the show forever.  I mean, Opie told me he didn't want him on the after show.  He didn't want to have him on this show.  Then Bobo started sending angry Twitters out.  Uh, did you see he deleted it?  He deleted his angry Twitters?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Uh, he can't spell a tweet, but he can figure out how to delete one. 
[03:39:30]  Apparently.  Apparently.  So, some chick wins a thousand dollars and a date with Bobo.  That's right.  Team come true.  Who's paying for the date?  This, that's what I was going to say.  This thousand dollars, that's not the date budget.  No.  So.  As far as I know.  We're paying, the company we, is paying for the date.  Well, I think, I think Trojan is, yeah.  Okay.  Whatever it is.  Trojan is sponsoring the contest.  Okay.  Well, I mean, look, I got to tell you something.  Trojan is being a big team player in this.  I agree.  And by the way, their products are fantastic.  Troy uses them all the time.  You won't, you won't end up with a Bobo if you use a Trojan. 
[03:40:00]  It should be their new squad.  And I think, and I think that's the purpose of this contest, that, you know, if you would  use Trojan, you wouldn't end up with Bobo.  So, okay, so they're going to send in an email to Opie and Anthony at SiriusXM.com.  Yes.  Oh, they have to send a photo and a paragraph.  Yeah, we need a recent photo.  Now, if, if you go to the website, if you go to SiriusXM.com slash the virus,  all the rules are up there.  And I encourage all the girls to read those rules because there are specific things that 
[03:40:30]  we need from them.  Like, like if they don't abide by the rules, they're going to get disqualified and not be  told they're disqualified.  So if you want to win, just read the rules.  Yeah, it's really easy.  It takes, you know, two minutes.  So you need a photo.  Full photo.  Now, is that part of the judging criteria?  Yes.  Okay.  And who's judging?  We are.  Oh, the whole staff gets to judge?  Okay.  And a quick paragraph of 500 words or less telling the show a few things about yourself  and why you deserve a date with Bobo. 
[03:41:00]  And that's, we want something heartfelt, right?  That's important, yeah.  Like, you want something that really, don't half-ass this, something that, like, puts  forth, you know, what you, why you like Bobo, why you want to date with him so bad.  Because you don't just want gold diggers, do we?  No, we want someone who really likes Bobo for who he is.  We want somebody that's going to be like, the prize here is the date with Bobo.  Yeah, $1,000, that's, you know, that's an afterthought.  Okay, next month we are actually going to play the Bobo dating game.  Yeah, you, if you're entering this contest, the three final, we're going to choose three 
[03:41:30]  finalists.  The three finalists will have to provide their own transportation to our studios so we  could play the Bobo dating game in studio.  So you could win if you live in Oklahoma, but you've got to get to New York.  You've got to get to New York, yeah.  Okay.  Okay, and here I'm reading the copy, and this is my problem with it.  So girls give a short presentation.  Oh, okay, I see the rules here.  This is hilarious.  After all the contestants have stated their case, Bobo and his uncanny ability to remember 
[03:42:00]  details will have to recite as much as he can remember about each girl.  So now, does this mean they, so they're all three going to do it, and then, like, it's  not like one does it and Bobo recites, the next does it, Bobo recites.  All three have to do it.  Maybe we'll talk to Bobo a little bit, and then he'll have to point to the girls and talk  about what they talked about.  Yeah, that's right.  Oh my God, that's going to be difficult for them.  I think he'll pass with flying colors.  Whoever Bobo finds to be the most memorable.  Okay, so Bobo may not even, if he gets overexcited, and the one that he wants, he can't remember 
[03:42:30]  about, he doesn't get the date with her.  No, because he doesn't remember anything about her.  It's who, and Bobo could technically, if he was smart enough, throw this, and if there  was somebody he didn't want, not, but let's, let's be honest, not remember, but let's be  honest, who does Bobo not want at this point?  That's a good point.  So that's not going to be an issue.  This is my issue.  Whoever Bobo finds to be the most memorable will win a date with Bobo, parentheses, accompanied 
[03:43:00]  by Sam.  That's you.  Why?  How did I get into this copy?  You had dick in the ass.  I certainly did.  I got the old rolling dick in the ass.  Look, I don't know about you, but I would love to accompany Bobo on a date.  Uh-huh.  So I'm, is this because I'm kind of an experienced reporter?  Yeah, for the show.  For the show.  Yeah, for the show.  Plus, you're the cheapest person to go eat, like wings.  Do I get a meal?  I don't know.  Probably wings or something, like chicken fingers.  Well, I better get some food out of this.  And am I going to be sitting at the table with them? 
[03:43:30]  I would hope so.  Okay.  I mean, you got to get audio somehow, right?  Okay, so I'll be recording the date.  Yeah.  And maybe the date will probably happen the day of the show.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll go to lunch.  I would assume that we would go.  Okay, so theoretically how it's going to work.  For a lunch date.  She'll be talking to you the whole meal.  No, no, no.  I won't allow that to happen.  I will not cock-block Bobo.  No, you're like, you know how production staff can't help people on Survivor?  Right.  Yeah, you can't help them.  No, no.  I'm not there to do that. 
[03:44:00]  But I guess we'll do the dating game.  Assuming the show doesn't go until 11 a.m., we'll have Bobo and the girl on the after show.  And then after the after show, maybe the three of us go to a nice lunch date.  Sbarro or something.  Sbarro.  It's my favorite New York pizza place.  Michael Scott's, too.  Oh, it's incredible.  But I guess it might be good that somebody goes, because Bobo, as fun and whimsical as he is in here,  I don't think he's to be trusted around a female by himself. 
[03:44:30]  A, I don't think he's to be trusted, and B, there's no way we would be able to talk to him three days later about what happened.  He'd have no idea.  He'd make something up.  He'd claim sex.  Yes.  Because he lies a lot.  How did, now, is this just because we wanted to do a contest and Bobo just lucked out?  Because, like, literally last week, he was banned.  That's true.  But we did submit this idea to sales a very long time ago.  Oh, is that what happened?  Go sell this.  This is a great idea.  So I might have agreed to this, like, a long... 
[03:45:00]  You absolutely agreed to it a very long time ago.  But I have no recollection.  No.  That's horrible.  Oh, I think Eric's...  Oh, he's probably calling the man himself.  Because, I mean, he wasn't going to be on the show, but maybe he should come in this week on the after show and do, like, some kind of dating profile so the girls know what he's looking for.  Yeah, we could do that.  What do you think?  I think that's a great idea.  And maybe we'll throw it up, like, YouTube, E-Armony style.  I mean, that'll give people, you know, another week.  Because we're soliciting this week and next week, so... 
[03:45:30]  Okay, so you have to get your emails in this week and next week.  You know, earlier the better, folks.  I mean, we're going to start judging this.  And if you put it off, you're just going to...  It's not going to happen.  Does Bo need a dating coach?  I don't think that's fair to give him a dating coach.  I mean, we could give him...  We could all, if he's in here before the date, kind of give him some tips on what he could do.  Because, I mean, honestly, this is for a radio promotion, sure.  But if the two hit it off... 
[03:46:00]  This could be lifelong.  Yeah, I mean, he could marry this girl.  Yeah.  Does it have to be a girl?  That's a good question.  I mean, can guys enter?  I'd, like, know the answer to that.  Okay.  Maybe we should look at the rules.  I'm going to read the official rules.  Okay, because if those rules that are already written, if they don't say must be female,  then I say we open this up to fellas, too, and then leave it to the judges, because we  have to be fair.  Or...  Leave it to Bobo.  Men in dresses.  Something like that.  Like, you know, two girls and a guy.  What if Bobo remembers more information about a man? 
[03:46:30]  Well, then, guess who he's going on a date with?  Sorry, buddy.  Was he not answering, Eric?  He's not answering, but did anybody...  Does anybody know that he changed his voicemail?  It's fantastic.  That is so aggravating, what I just heard.  I don't know.  Maybe we'll just talk to him about it when he's in, just to be on the safe side.  It's a great voice around.  Why, uh...  What did it say, Eric?  He's not that important.  What did it say?  We'll record it, and then when he's in, we can play it.  Eric, what did the...  But what did it say? 
[03:47:00]  We'll still want to hear it recorded in a few days, because we want to hear it.  All right, so he gives his name and said, I'm not here.  Please leave a message.  For Opie and Anthony-related business...  And then he trips on what he's saying, and then he goes, for Opie and Anthony-related business,  please refer all information to my Facebook.  Okay.  He probably gives out the address, right?  No.  Of course not.  What Opie and Anthony-related business could there be?  That's like when you call, like, an executive or something and say, in case of an emergency, 
[03:47:30]  call my assistant at this number, or a doctor, or something like that.  He's not that important.  Well, maybe the bosses have called him.  Eric, could you leave the mic on...  Okay.  ...and call Rob Cross's office...  All right.  ...and then, as soon as he picks up, say, hey, Rob, it's Eric, you're on the air.  And then, once you talk...  And then ask him, when was the last time you called Bobo's cell phone on Opie and Anthony-related business?  Okay.  Okay?  So we'll just call Rob Cross, because maybe because we don't, you know, call him on Opie  and Anthony-related business doesn't mean the bosses don't. 
[03:48:00]  And hopefully Rob is listening to this in his office, so he expects it coming.  Maybe he just won't answer the phone.  Probably get coffee.  You think you want to get coffee?  Yeah.  Oh.  Leave a message if, you know, if he doesn't pick up, because I would still...  Maybe he'll call back or come down or something.  If he checks his messages.  I'm going to reach Rob Cross.  I'm going to reach Rob Cross.  Ah.  That's Rob Cross's voice, man.  I'm talking over it just in case he says...  Hey, Rob.  It's Eric from After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:48:30]  Could you do us a favor and either call in or come down to the studio as soon as you get  this message?  Thank you very much.  Oh.  Okay.  I appreciate you doing that.  Eric, you are one of the Bobo haters, for sure.  Oh, wait.  Phone's ringing.  Oh.  You know how to answer it.  Ah, okay.  Hold on.  Hey, Bob Cross, you're on the air.  Is that cool?  Hey.  Yeah, what was it?  I need to do a phone ring.  Oh, you had a ring.  Does that matter?  Okay.  Bob Cross.  He called her.  We wanted to know, when was the last time you actually called Bobo?  On Opie and Anthony related business. 
[03:49:00]  On Opie.  On Opie.  On Opie.  For Opie and Anthony related business.  You can see who's on the air, though.  All right.  Never?  Yeah, he did.  Never?  Never.  Never.  Okay.  Well, that explains that.  Thank you, Rob.  Thank you, Bob.  That's it.  Eric, why are you going out of your way to be disrespectful and call him Bob?  I love Bob.  His name is not Bob.  Ah, Rob Cross.  I love Rob.  I'd say Rob picks a great food truck.  I was going to ask him what food truck we're going today.  Did the phone just ring again?  Why is he doing it with...  Yeah, hang on.  Why are you always doing the mic off?  Because I wanted to see who the number is first. 
[03:49:30]  Hold on.  So he has to turn the mic off.  Hey, Rob, you're on the air.  Is that cool?  Don't call me Bob, fucker.  You got you.  Well, I guess we'll...  Oh, and can my fiancée, Jess, can she enter this?  Yeah, sure.  She's...  Yeah?  Well, she's not related to any family member.  Oh, Jess, you better...  She's not related to an employee yet.  You better get on that email and speak slowly.  What happens if I hit it off?  Yeah, I mean, I still think I'm entitled to some of the thousand. 
[03:50:00]  Even if Bobo and her hit it off and she leaves me for Bobo, I would still think I get at least 500 bucks, right?  Yeah, I mean, you'd have to talk to Jess about that, but I don't know.  I mean, at this point, we've been together so long, it's like...  That 500?  That 500?  That 500?  New TV?  Exactly.  I was watching SummerSlam on the Simmons View 5000 last night.  Ooh.  The Russell Simmons TV.  Although, I made the mistake of tweeting out a picture with action figures next to it, and people realized that action figures are about six inches tall.  And so, in relation to the television...  Doesn't it look that good?  No, they all made fun of me for having a small TV and asked if I was watching on a laptop, which was not my intention. 
[03:50:30]  Just trying to tweet out a cute little, you know, wrestling picture.  All right, so, everybody should...  All the girls, and we'll check on the guys.  I mean, if you guys want to enter, whatever.  She already probably is fucking Bobo, one of the people on Instant Feedback said...  Who's that, Jess?  Yeah.  That's not nice.  And, seriously, I would probably doubt it.  And I'm sure Bobo would tell us.  We would find out.  We would have found out about it, either from Jess or Bobo by now.  Yeah, that's right.  Plus, he's not her type. 
[03:51:00]  So, email in at opianthony at SiriusXM.com.  And make sure you look at all the rules at SiriusXM.com slash the virus, because the last thing we want to do is disqualify anybody.  I would hate for Bobo's one true love to be disqualified.  Get disqualified.  Yeah.  Because if we find her, we're going to pick her.  Huh?  Or him.  Or him.  Or him.  Or him.  Or him.  Good point.  We don't know.  Who's this Tony Sunshine?  Do you know about this guy, Travis?  He sent in the Good Boy Phone song?  No, I don't know who he is. 
[03:51:30]  I just know that Opie played it at the end of the show, and it's going to be in my head all day.  Well, we're going to play it again.  Great.  I mean, he did a good song.  You played two clips.  What's going on?  I mean, they're not like clips.  They're like little songs.  Just short.  This is the new Good Boy Phone song by Tony Sunshine.  I don't know if he's on Twitter or where he's at, but he did a good song.  Good job.  He is on Twitter.  He was sending it to us all weekend, so.  Oh, okay.  So Tony Sunshine on Twitter.  Yeah, he did a good job.  Here it is.  Almost sounds a little sublime-ish. 
[03:52:00]  Or Blake Shelton-ish.  It doesn't sound anything like Blake Shelton.  It's like Jamaican influence.  You just wanted to mention the name.  Get those album sales up, buddy.  Here it is.  Tony Sunshine and the Good Boy Phone song.  Again, we'll be talking to them.  Him got a good boy phone.  Him not the boy phone.  Him not the boy phone.  Him good boy phone.  Him good boy phone.  Him not the boy phone.  Him not the boy phone.  Him good boy phone.  Little Yimmy got him good boy phone.  So he can book a gig with J Light. 
[03:52:30]  And little Yimmy got a Matty boy phone So he can call a tranny when he's hedging  all alone And Anthony has got a good boy phone  So he can get a call from ten early in the morning  Anthony got his Matty boy phone You never know Casey Anthony could try to  call him a good boy phone And I'm Matty boy phone  Matty boy phone And I'm good boy phone  And I'm Matty boy phone Matty boy phone  And I'm good boy phone Anthony got him Matty boy phone 
[03:53:00]  Little Yimmy got him Matty boy phone  Opie Hughes only got one phone He'm the only one not a creep on the show  It's a good boy phone And I'm Matty boy phone  Matty boy phone And I'm good boy phone  And I'm good boy phone And I'm Matty boy phone  Beautiful. Here on After Opie and Anthony Live  And Opie came off looking like a million bucks in that song  The only one who's not a creep apparently According to Tony Sunshine 
[03:53:30]  Now I  If you want his Twitter is  ToenailTruth on Twitter  Why wouldn't he just make it Tony Sunshine?  I don't know  ToenailTruth?  ToenailTruth  That's a much worse name than Tony Sunshine  Maybe somebody took it  CokeLogic is tweeting in ToenailTruth as well  I can't believe CokeLogic is promoting somebody else  CokeLogic!  You're supposed to be promoting yourself Not other people  What's wrong with you?  Speaking of promoting other people  Opie Radio on YouTube  He posted a new video  And Eric, I don't want to dwell on this 
[03:54:00]  I don't want to talk about it for too long  But I feel like it should be brought up  Okay?  Were you at the Opie Radio YouTube channel this weekend?  Was I at the...  No, why?  Okay  He posted the video  We talked about this on the After Show before  He posted the video  Of me  Tasting Guy Fieri  The steak that Guy Fieri made  Fieri  Okay  No, I'm not going to call him that  Guy Fieri  I'm not going to call him that  He's the best  But he posted 
[03:54:30]  First of all, I can't believe that everybody  To this day  Is still obsessed with what I eat  Relax  Like  There are people who don't eat red meat  There are vegans in this world  There's Sam Roberts  Who just is not going to eat steak  Yeah, but the world countries are starving  They're saying you spit on me  So don't feed it to me  You'll eat it  Fuck yeah  It's not going to go to waste  I'll eat a little baby  Okay  But here's the problem  E-Rock  We had this debate  I mean, it turned into a debate  Of whether or not  One can have an allergic reaction to alcohol 
[03:55:00]  But we had a debate  As to whether or not  Guy Fieri  Putting  Cooking vodka  In my mouth  Was an asshole move  Correct?  We had that debate  That was your call, yeah  And your argument was  It was not an asshole move  I agree  Because  He showed  Opie, Anthony, and Jim  That it was  Vodka  Before he gave it to me  That was your argument, right?  Yeah  I agree with you  I don't see that in the video  Oh, okay  I don't see that in the video, Eric 
[03:55:30]  Yeah  Well, actually  I just  Gave it to him  I thought it was water  I thought he was just joking  Like a fake  Like a squirt  Right  Yeah, no  He did not  Show it to other people  You can check the video out  YouTube  Opie Radio  Say what you want about me  It doesn't  It doesn't bother me  That there are some of you  That would prefer  If I had red meat  For dinner  It's not something  That I spend time  Thinking about  And it's flattering  That you spend as much 
[03:56:00]  Time thinking about me  But  Okay  Okay  You see  Because he lifts up  The bottle of vodka  And then he puts it down  I will  I will apologize for that  Because what  He does  Towards the end of this video  I thought happened before  He went over there  And you were right  They  They turned and grabbed it  And  Went and squirted it  Into the mouth  Guy Fieri made the call  Not Opie and Anthony  No, Guy Fieri  Yes  Thank you  Fieri  Thank you  And  Is that  Give me this, Eric  Yeah  Is that a little more 
[03:56:30]  Of an asshole move?  No  It's still not an asshole move  A little more of one  Give me something  That's what guys would do  What guys would do that?  Regular guys  Nobody that I would hang out with  And eat regular food  And drink alcohol  And everything else  So what's wrong with people  Who don't drink alcohol, Eric?  There's nothing wrong with that  But what you did  They're not regular guys  He wasn't a dick move  They're not  They're not guys  Who don't  Sorry we don't all have  Condoms to fish out of  Garbage cans  Because girls want to  Inseminate themselves  With us so badly  That doesn't make any sense  But alright  It's just  It's a callback  To what you did 
[03:57:00]  When you were younger  Let me ask you  So you mean  The five drinks I had  Was bad?  Roland  Roland were they not delicious?  They were amazing  Listen people  What were they?  They had champagne  And ice cream  And what?  More alcohol  That's all I could  I don't want anybody  To get the wrong idea  Okay?  Roland when you and I  Were at Eric's birthday party  Yes  And it came time for  Oh by the way  I found video  Oh yeah  I found it on a disc somewhere  I gotta bring it in  Of Roland  Tell me this Roland  It came time for 
[03:57:30]  Strawberry mojitos  Yes  Who was the worst influence  At the entire table  Who was the guy  You  Who was having his fiance  Who was shushing his fiance  While ordering you more drinks  And trying to get you  To drink into oblivion  Because you were enjoying yourself  That was you sir  I don't want anybody  To think I don't have a good time  You did  You ordered  I said I'll take one  And you told the woman  Bring him two more  Yeah  So I had three  And then we had that contest  Of how fast I could drink all three  Because you liked that  It was delicious  And we had a good time together  Didn't we 
[03:58:00]  We had a blast  And that's what I'm all about  People having a good time  Not  Yeah you're kind of like  You're like the  Whisperer to the drunks  Right  I love drunk people  I like to hang out  With drunk people  I think they're funny  But Big Kev hits  He doesn't like drunk people  Big Kev is a little more  He punched me  You know Big Kev  He used to have a show  Here on SiriusXM  Called Big Kev's Geek Stuff  Now it's web exclusive  But  He's a little more  Anal retentive  I'm a little more like  Okay we're hanging  Out  I did poke him though  With the  Poke 
[03:58:30]  You also  For Eric  It was a bad idea  To invite  Roland and Big Kev  To your birthday party  You gotta pick one  Or the other  From now on  Who knew at that point  I've never had them  In the same room together  Because Big Kev  At the very beginning  Of the night  Before Roland  Had even had anything  To drink  Went to the bathroom  And he stayed in there  For 25 minutes  Literally  Half hour  Half hour  And the entire  Rest of the evening  Roland was bringing up  Big Kev shits  Now Eric 
[03:59:00]  You know Big Kev  Better than any of us  Yeah  How do you think  That made him feel  What that he was in there  For half an hour  No that Roland  Insisted  In mixed company  When he got back  To the table  Oh announcing  That he was  Yeah  That wasn't  I'd say he's been  For half hour  I don't know  What he was doing  In the bathroom  And then the waitress  Coming over  Oh yeah  And saying  Does he want anything  To drink  And Roland responding  With  No he's  He has the shits  He's shitting right now  Of course there was also 
[03:59:30]  Roland  You can't turn it  Against him  Because Roland  Went to the bathroom  And then he came back  And he stood at the foot  Of the table  And he said very loudly  For the entire restaurant  Quote  I just did caca  Did I?  Yes you did  I remember  At which point  Jess  My fiance  Was just disgusted  She looked at Eric's wife  Who was disgusted  Eric had his head  In his hand  And I was in tears  Laughing so hard 
[04:00:00]  I thought Eric was hot  Like whooping the head  No he was embarrassed  Do you remember Roland  Saying that Eric?  I do now  Now that you said  I just did  Caca  Was the quote  And then followed up  With ordering  Strawberry mojitos  No no it wasn't  Strawberry mojitos  It was some specialty drink  Oh yeah  That had like  Four or five  Different kinds of rum  Yeah seven rums  Seven rums  It was layered  With fruit juice  Give me four seven rums  Yeah it was delicious  It tasted good  Oh man 
[04:00:30]  Well that's all that counts  I can go back  And get wasted there  I gotta go hooligans  And get wasted  But if you want to see  The Guy Fieri video  And realize  That at least  What I'm  I mean you don't  Don't agree with me  If you don't want to  But at least acknowledge  That what I'm saying  Is truthful  It's at youtube  Slash op radio  And it's good  That we have an evidence  Of things like this  And you know  And all I know is  Guy Fieri got a lot  Of tweets over the weekend  That he was tagged on  Of people saying  Nasty things about me  So  Oh really 
[04:01:00]  Oh yeah  They were all like  Hey Guy Fieri  Blah blah blah blah  Not Sam  Blah blah blah blah  I would say  I love the Guy Fieri  Are we gonna have him  Back for Thanksgiving  Or sooner  We may  He wants to do  A no nay event  Oh nice  Tony Sunshine  Just posted the  Good boy phone song  On YouTube  That's a catchy thing  So uh  What is it  Toenail Clippings  Toenail Truth  Toenail Truth  On Twitter  Which is a horrible name  It's horrible  It's the worst  Tony Sunshine 
[04:01:30]  Is a great name  Toenail Truth  Is a horrible name  But  Find him on YouTube  And uh  Look up the song  Cause he does a great song  And if it's him singing  He's a hell of a vocalist too  Um  I wanted to  Speaking of vocalists  Look at that segue  I always try to figure out  What the segue is  In my head  Uh  While we still have  Time  I don't know  If we do have time  Um  Yeah  We'll just play it  And I'll cut it off  Uh  We had a speech impediment  Caller  Do you know what  That caller's name is  Eric  Do you remember  He's called in before  At the beginning of the show 
[04:02:00]  His name is  Gary  Gary  Yeah  Yes you're right  Gary called in before  Our Gary  No no no no no  It's not Gary  It's not  No Gary was the guy  Who called in about  He was talking about  The ins and outs  Of drug dealing  Oh right right right  Phil  Oh Phil then  Who's in there with you  That would be Troy Kwan  Troy Kwan  Mr. Angry  What's Troy Angry about  He destroyed my office  What  Oh you want  Where is he 
[04:02:30]  He's in here  Do you want him in there  Yeah yeah yeah  Roland just brought something up  Maybe we won't play this clip right now  Nah you should talk about the office  You think so  Yeah  I think you should post online  So people judge for themselves  Well I have a video  That I've kind of been sitting on  Uh  Troy's on his way in here right now  Because uh  I have a video from a different angle as well  Oh so you should send it to me  And I can splice together a nice thing  Cause you might have a better angle than me  Okay  Um  Roland is a ball buster  And people know this  Troy 
[04:03:00]  Doesn't particularly like to get fucked with  Not at all  And people know this  Uh  Specifically Roland  And what happens is  Roland sees somebody that doesn't like to get fucked with  And realizes  This is a person  Who I should fuck with  Uh  Uh  A couple weeks ago  Troy has a fan  Pointing towards his desk  So it cools him off  Gets hot in here  Does it not Troy?  Very hot  Time to time  Roland took a pile of napkins 
[04:03:30]  And threw them  Towards Troy's desk  Making sure they got caught in the fan  And so they went everywhere  On Troy's desk  Like a hundred  Right  Troy uh  Threw  Troy went into Roland's office  Threw a couple magazines on the floor  Whatever  And said  Roland  Let this be a lesson  If you fuck with me  I'm gonna fuck with you  Correct?  Yeah  And it's basically one of those things  Where it's just like  Just don't fuck with me  Don't fuck with me  I will never fuck with you  I won't fuck with your food  I won't fuck with your belongings 
[04:04:00]  I'll never touch it  But if somebody fucks with you  But if you cross that barrier  And you fuck with me  I'll be your worst nightmare  Do I hear?  What?  Fuck with me  Right  Let's challenge this  So Roland decided  After much deliberation  He decided on Thursday  Because you weren't in on  What day was it?  No it was Tuesday  Okay it was Tuesday  Because you weren't in on Wednesday  Thursday  On Tuesday of last week  Roland  Got a giant stack of napkins  Then he went to the bathroom  And got a giant stack of paper towels 
[04:04:30]  And combined the two  Yes  Then for some reason  He had pink foam bunny ears  In his office  That he put on his head  He made sure that I was videoing  On my phone  And then he hopped out of the office  Like a bunny  He approached  He approached  Troy's desk  And he threw  A hundred napkins  Directly at Troy's face  Yeah  And they all hit you  Right in the face  Right in the face  While you were working  Right  You got angry  Of course  You got frustrated 
[04:05:00]  The bunny ears pissed him off  And did it annoy you  To see Roland  With the bunny ears  Laughing  That was adding insult to injury  Right  And so what Troy did was  He went straight into Roland's office  And Roland looked at him like  No  And Troy looked at him and said  I told you not to fuck with me  And he went in  And we have file cabinets  Mounted on the wall  We have stuff on top of them  He  The first thing he did  Was take his hand  And scoop everything off  The file cabinets  Throw it onto the floor  Then he took everything 
[04:05:30]  On Roland's desk  Threw it on the floor  Then he grabbed something  Behind Roland's computer  Roland goes  Wait wait  That's important  And Troy put his finger  On Roland's face  And said  You shouldn't have fucked with me  And he takes it  And he slams it  Into the garbage can  It broke  It broke  It broke  Troy then opens  Roland's drawers  I know  And he goes  Oh I forgot about the drawers  Roland wasn't expecting that  And he starts  Taking piles of paper  And throwing them  All over the office  Roland puts his hand  Over the drawer  And says  Wait wait  That's important 
[04:06:00]  Troy puts his finger  In Roland's face  And says  I told you  You shouldn't have  Fucked with my shit  And Roland said  Okay  Because he realized  Physically  He's not going to  Beat Troy this time  So he removes his hand  And Troy continues  To throw things  All over the place  Did you lose anything  In the melee Roland  Thank God for Sam's  Small hands  Because he was able  To reach my  New apartment  Lease contract  I had to get  Signed  Otherwise it would have  Been gone  It was tucked  Behind the drawers  Did you feel better  After that  Oh of course  It was therapeutic  Do you want to try  To hear some audio  Of it 
[04:06:30]  It was like  Two hours of cleaning  Yeah I mean  It's a short clip  If it's any good  Let's see  I'm playing it  Right off the phone  Here  That sounds like  Shit getting fucked  With  And listen  Roland is a clutter bug  So he's got stuff  Everywhere  It's just shit  Everywhere  Piled up  And it was all  On the floor  Maybe I will post  That video up  And Eric  You gotta send me  That clip  Will you 
[04:07:00]  Okay  Wait he's going  Through the drawers now  He was laughing  Sturignolo was laughing  I was laughing  It was a hilarious thing  And a sight to be seen  What will you do  If he fucks with you again  Oh you told me  What will it be  I told him  If he fucks with me again  I'm going to take  I'm going to sleep on it  I'm not going to  I'm not going to  Attack right away  I'm going to sleep on it  It could be a month  It could be three months  It could be a year  Oh my god  But whenever I decide  That I'm going to attack  I'm going to take  Whatever is on his desk  And I don't give a shit  What it is  And I'm throwing it  All in the paper shredder
