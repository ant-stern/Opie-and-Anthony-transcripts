<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with an announcement of a new affiliate station, WCMF in Rochester, New York, followed by a recounting of their firing from a Boston station due to an April Fool's Day joke about the mayor's death.  The irony of Don Belucas, who fired them, now being in a position to approve their appearance on WCMF (a station under his Infinity Broadcasting oversight) was highlighted.  The hosts detailed the investigation and Dave Douglasâ€™ attempts to downplay his role.

A lengthy and scathing review of Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes" followed.  Opie and Anthony, along with callers Bluto, Tony, Dave, Big Kev, and Jay, relentlessly mocked the film's plot, acting (especially Mark Wahlberg's), and inconsistencies like the unexplained horses.  Humorous comparisons to "Back to the Future" were made throughout this segment.

The show then transitioned to Bill Clinton's recent Harlem appearance.  Opie and Anthony speculated on Clinton's motives, his relationship with Hillary, and his solo public appearances, using crude language and playing audio clips to support their sarcastic commentary on Clinton's behavior and speeches. This discussion continued, focusing on Clinton's public image and personal life.

Further comedic commentary on Bill Clinton's post-presidency speaking engagements, described as rambling and unpolished, filled a portion of the show.  Audience reactions to bad stand-up comedians at Showtime at the Apollo, particularly a flamboyant male dancer, were also discussed.  A phone call with Kimmy from *Survivor* followed, where she discussed her experiences, rejecting a $300,000 Playboy photoshoot offer in favor of a more lucrative *Edge* magazine shoot where she kept her clothes on.  Jim Norton, present in the studio, engaged in sexually suggestive banter with Kimmy.  Under pressure, Kimmy eventually admitted to a previous encounter with Kevin James.  A live in-studio performance by Clutch ensued.  Prior to their performance, Neil from Clutch confessed to defecating in the studio bathroom, leading to further humorous conversation with the hosts and listeners. The show concluded this segment with a discussion of their "Man Boop" contest entries, described as unusual and unattractive, culminating in Opie breaking a microphone.

The next segment centered on complaints about intrusive pop-up ads on their website, particularly after voting in the "Man Boob" contest, with Opie expressing anger at the sales team. This transitioned into a series of listener calls and studio conversations about various scams (gas siphoning, parking meter manipulation, fraudulent Home Depot returns), with Jay Moore, Jim Norton, Old Dirty Bastard, and Cowbell Bill in the studio. A caller, Amy from Philadelphia, inquired about a previous guest foot-licking incident.  Other topics included a Christina Aguilera photo, the Puerto Rican referendum on Vieques, and The Rock's return to WWF. Jim Norton's encounter with a transgender sex worker was also humorously recounted.

The final segment covered a range of topics, including Opie's observations of transgender sex workers and Rich Voss; promotion of Pinnacle Horned Goatweed, a male libido enhancement product, with sexually suggestive commentary by the hosts and Old Dirty Bastard; a news story about women drugging and robbing men in Columbia, discussed with profanity and graphic detail; and numerous listener calls containing sexually explicit content and offensive jokes.  The segment ended with a sudden promotion of O2Go water, maintaining the show's characteristic profanity and inappropriate humor throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's, uh, let's, uh, take a break.  And we'll be back.  No, no, no, no, no, we're here.  No, no, no.  Gotta get rid of that at the end of some of the old days.  Yes.  Just a little warm-up bit for everyone.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got brand new Mike Tyson to talk about today.  He's back in the news, so we'll cover that a little later in the show.  Yeah, a little later.  Anthony, we gotta welcome our brand new affiliates.  Yes.  WCMF in Rochester, New York.  Hello, yes, a new city. 
[00:00:30]  The virus has spread to western New York and we couldn't be happier, Anthony.  Isn't that great?  There's a cute little story as far as WCMF in Rochester goes.  A lot of people may think it's because I kind of started my radio career in Rochester.  Well, that's nice.  It's nice to be back, uh, on the Rochester airwaves.  Sure.  But another example of, uh, Opie and Anthony winning.  We always win in the end.  Always win in the end.  Don't want to bore people too much with this story because we've said it, we've explained it, uh, I don't know, probably a hundred times now in the media. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  But, uh, Ant and I were doing a very successful radio show in Boston when we were told to leave the state and to never return.  Yeah, we got the boot.  We said the mayor of Boston was dead, uh, on April Fool's a few years back and they fired us.  Everyone knows that.  Right.  Well, the guy who fired us, the actual guy, the, uh, head, muckety-mucks, uh, employee suit guy that does the firing, uh, was a guy named Don Belucas. 
[00:01:30]  Don Belucas.  Don Belucas called us into a hotel conference room up in Boston and said, uh, I hate to meet you under these circumstances, but, um, we're going to have to terminate your contract.  Right.  Oh, I, he did say before that, I hear you're really good and you're making a lot of money for the company, but, uh, but, uh, we're in a, we're in a multi-billion dollar merger and, uh, we're going to have to terminate your contract.  Terminate your contract.  Remember that day, Anthony?  Yes, I do.  We were kicked to the curb, never to return, and we really didn't know what was going to happen with our little careers at that point. 
[00:02:00]  It was a turning point for the Opie and Anthony show, a rallying point, actually.  Yeah, we lucked out, you know, I mean, I, I encourage every, uh, radio, radio guy in America to say the mayor of your city, of your city, that the mayor died.  And see if you could, like, uh, you know, get your career up and going after that.  Parlay it into the number one market, though, with syndication.  Go ahead.  It's not a guarantee.  Give it a whirl.  And we really didn't know what the hell was going to happen to you and I.  Because you could be, uh, somebody that says something outrageous and then you're sitting there going, water doodle-y, why, uh, why am I, uh, broadcasting, uh, nowhere-y. 
[00:02:30]  So there's a little saying on this show.  We say Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  Yeah.  Another fun example of that today because, uh, the only reason you're hearing us in Rochester, New York today is because of Don Belucas.  Don Belucas.  The Terminator, the man that completely destroyed our careers a little over three years ago.  Yeah.  He had to actually, what they call, sign off on this. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  Because now he was the last word.  He works for Infinity Broadcasting as well now.  Yeah.  Because through this whole merger thing, he, uh, joined Infinity.  Yeah.  And he's in, one of the stations he's in charge of is WCMF in Rochester.  So he had to agree to have us on his airway.  Hey, hey, hey.  Ha, ha, ha.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  And I was up there recently and, uh, I guess Don Belucas, uh, went to like the, you know, the head muckety mucks up there.  Yeah.  And said, uh, man, I hear Opie and Anthony don't really like me. 
[00:03:30]  Well, you fired us, you tool.  You fired us and we haven't talked to you since.  Yeah.  Do the math.  Figure it out.  I've got a contract.  They got back to me.  They were talking bad about me on their radio show.  Why would they do that?  Oh, I don't know.  You left us without jobs for a while.  Because you fired us.  You fired us.  After a week of jerking us around.  What about that woman?  Who was that woman that, um, was handling the investigation?  Believe me, this was such a huge deal.  They had an investigation. 
[00:04:00]  I'll tell you who the woman was.  And it was the old GM of WCMF in Rochester.  Was it?  I told you I used to work for her.  Yeah, but I, there's so many people out of there.  You mentioned, I can't remember.  When I started my radio career, I was just a little punk in Rochester.  Yeah.  And, uh, Susan McDonald was the GM.  That was her.  And she was in charge of WCMF.  So she goes, they were just blowing smoke.  It was ridiculous.  They knew damn well we were getting fired.  But they waited a week to try to see if we'd roll over on anyone else.  So they had this internal investigation to see who was involved in this may or dead prank. 
[00:04:30]  And, uh, the first day we sit down with, uh, Susan, was it?  Did you say Susan?  Uh, Susan McDonald.  She, uh, she goes, all right, well, what we're going to do, we're going to ask some questions.  We're just going to get to the bottom of what happened.  Let's, um, get this over with quick and let's get you back on the air.  Get you back on the air.  Right when she said that, I just looked at her and was like, like, I was disgusted.  Like, I know damn well that we're not getting back on the air. 
[00:05:00]  Her whole job was to try to figure out who else they were going to fire with us.  Exactly.  Well, we took the hit.  We didn't, we didn't take anyone with us.  Dave Dickless, our, uh, PD.  Guys?  On the phone.  How many phone calls did you get that were like,  Guys, hi, it's Dave.  Um, listen, uh, could you just say that, um, I didn't come in until the last, uh, break of the show.  Could you say that?  Ass.  Yeah, the PD, well, we've talked about that too.  He just rolled over on everyone he could. 
[00:05:30]  We'll save that story for when we're live in Boston.  In Boston.  Well, basically, yeah, the PD, Dave Douglas, uh, called me at home begging me to, to keep him out of this and, and begging me to change the facts around.  Even though I'm like, look, man, the show's on tape.  He goes, it's really important that, uh, you didn't start the whole mayor is dead prank until after five o'clock.  When I was long gone after five o'clock.  Because I'll blame it on Bruce E. Mittman and the shwookies.  He goes, you got to promise me that you'll say, uh, you know, it happened after five o'clock. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Like, Dave, I can't promise you that.  There's tape out there.  People are going to think we're liars.  We're going into the gazole.  Dave.  So, hello, Rochester and WCMF.  And hello, Don Balucas.  Don Balucas.  Ha, ha.  Hello.  Hello, we're here again.  And no, Joe, you'll never find out the third mystery party that was involved in the mayor dead scheme.  No, but he's doing very well in morning radio.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  He called me and begged me.  He says, dude, come on.  Did he?  Oh, yeah.  Recently?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Wow.  That would be a great push for him.  I think enough time has gone by.  Come on.  Blurt it out.  No, man.  He's a good friend from the old days.  No.  Still come in time.  He'll want to come on the air with us.  He was the fake news reporter for our little, the mayor is dead.  And I can't believe the industry hasn't figured out who it is yet.  I know.  Bluto, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  You guys see Planet of the Apes this weekend?  Oh. 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Tell him how I was ranting and raving in that back office.  Yeah, right when I walked in.  Bluto, I freaking hated it.  You too, right?  Right when I walk in the office, Rick goes, did you see Planet of the Apes?  And Opie just starts screaming, don't get me started again.  Sucked.  It just occurred to me that the gorillas in Planet of the Apes are actually smarter and  more civil than Mike Tyson.  There you go.  Yeah.  And the Charlton Heston scene?  Yeah.  You see that?  I don't want to cry. 
[00:07:30]  I don't need a gun message in the middle of my movie, thank you very much.  Even if it's being delivered by an old Charlton Heston ape guy.  Oh, my God.  When he said that line, I wanted to cry.  Damn them.  You speaking humans.  Damn them all to hell.  And the comic relief where it wasn't needed just felt like Star Wars all over again.  Uh.  Does Tim Burton show his cute little movies to his friends before he decides to, you  know, release it to the world?  Dude, but he's the type of guy that no matter who he showed it to, they would go, oh, my 
[00:08:00]  God, that's great.  That's great, boss.  The only thing I'd say in that movie was Tim Roth and the special effects.  Mark Wahlberg could not carry a movie if it had a handle on it.  I said Mark Wahlberg couldn't carry a bag of groceries.  He was horrible.  The only thing was the special effects.  He was the worst, man.  Tim Roth was good, but he was constantly looking through his eyebrows.  He always had his head down.  He was looking out of the top of his eyes the whole time with that voice.  Right.  He was really good.  I love you, honey bunny.  He was really good.  Okay, this is a robbery. 
[00:08:30]  But the new Nova?  Yeah.  Even though it wasn't based on...  No, no.  That chick is hot.  She should have been naked, though.  Should have been more naked.  For my $850, $950, whatever I'm paying for a movie these days, she should have been  top or something.  At the end, she kind of looked hot.  I'll tell you, though, the movie, very disappointed.  I liked it because I like Planet of the Apes.  I liked the makeup.  I liked some of the special effects as far as them jumping around and stuff. 
[00:09:00]  It was pretty cool.  But there was no story to speak of.  Horrible.  Just like nothing going on.  Right.  And the ending, I was just like, now people are screaming, shut up!  Don't say...  It was just retarded.  You know, and they've talked about it in the news, not giving away the ending, which I  won't do, don't worry.  But they call it like a Twilight Zone type ending.  Let me tell you something right now.  What?  If I get worked up enough, I will.  No, no.  Because I'm that pissed off. 
[00:09:30]  People will tune out.  No, and I'm thinking I need to give away the ending to save these fine folks some money  today, Anthony.  No.  Holy S.  Why couldn't Tim Burton just take the original Planet of the Apes and followed it line for  line and just made it cooler with special effects and better gorilla costumes?  He thought he could revisit it and do a better job just making a completely new movie, which  I don't disagree with.  I think that could have been cool.  But there was nothing, and there were so many loose ends, it was ridiculous.  We both said it.  We both said this. 
[00:10:00]  It was Back to the Future with Apes.  Back to the Future.  It was Back to the Future with Apes.  I mean, you talk about...  Look, time machine...  I could give every...  Marky Mark was Marty McFly.  Marky Mark, Marty McFly.  Thayde, Senator Thayde, Tim Roth was Biff.  Biff, right?  He's Biff.  Yeah.  He's Biff!  The actual ship was the DeLorean.  That was your DeLorean.  This is it! 
[00:10:30]  Come on!  Bring me the spaceman.  Never said in the movie.  I know.  Well, Marky Mark, you're going to have to work your space pod up to 1.3.  3,000 gigawatts, or gigawatts, it's called gigawatts, and it was 1.2, 1, 2, 1.  It was!  It was Back to the Future 2!  The ending of it revert to Back to the Future 2, where Biff has to go back to 1955. 
[00:11:00]  He stole the time machine, the DeLorean, goes back to 1955, changes history, so that when  Marty McFly comes back from the year 2015 and goes back to 1985, it's a different 1985.  Thank you.  There's your answer.  Whoever saw it and toiled over the ending.  That was the ending.  And it's nice to know after 400 years, you can just dust off the inside of the spaceship  and get valuable information from it, even though the outside, the spaceship, is like 
[00:11:30]  a petrified forest now.  It was so weathered and petrified, yet the sliding glass doors worked.  Right.  You get a storm, and your back door sliding glass door doesn't work, because there's sand  and dirt in it.  This thing's been sitting for 400 years, or whatever it was.  Hey, a little lid just dusted it off, and it's ready to go.  Hey, he even dusted it off.  He shoved his hand in a little thing.  What about the door where he's just dusting off the control panel?  The monitor.  That was great.  He's pulling chunks of rock off of the face of the monitor so he can see the computer 
[00:12:00]  readout.  Great.  That's good.  That's good.  I spill a rum and coke while I'm on my computer and splash a little on the screen.  That's still there.  It's still on my screen.  This guy's got rocks rolling on his monitor.  Tony!  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  $70 million, my ass.  Wow.  That movie made $70 million over the freaking weekend.  It did make $70 million.  I saw it in Huntington, and I'll tell you, everyone left the theater like, no one, you  can tell when a movie, you know, is disappointing when people just walk out, you know? 
[00:12:30]  That's why they did that ending.  So you were too confused to go, that sucked.  Like, no one walked out going, that sucked.  You walk out like you just got stunned.  You just got, like, gassed or something.  And everyone was just like, huh, what?  But I, and then he went, but then, Major Nelson, he came in, but then all of a sudden  he's back.  But then, but who, how did, you're all confused.  You're too confused to say, that sucked.  Here's a sign when you know you're in a bad movie, when you constantly go to the person  next to you that you went with and say, hey, are you awake? 
[00:13:00]  Did she steal your blankie?  The only good, guys, one more point.  I couldn't bring, yeah.  Hold on, hold on.  All right, dude.  Good.  I couldn't bring the blankie because, you know, it's the first week of Planet of the Apes.  It was packed.  Yeah.  My late night movie was packed.  Couldn't bring the blankie.  Yeah.  Every theater was packed.  Go ahead, Tony.  Dude, one, two things.  The only thing that made it worth it for me was the earth, the human chick with the big  bobos, man.  She was on her in sexier outfits.  She should have got her wetter with the gorilla who was spraying down Heston. 
[00:13:30]  That would have been nice.  They should have had the famous ho scene with that and he goes him down.  They didn't treat him as badly as they treated him in the original.  Hey, Ope, in your theater, did they pull an animal house?  Because food was flying at that effing screen, man, and we pulled an Opie on the way out.  We ruined it for about 5,000 people waiting on line.  Hey, you told me.  We were like, F all of you.  The movie bit.  All right, cool.  Thanks, Tony.  Glad to fellas.  Thank God for Chris Christofferson's pivotal role in the movie that really changed the face 
[00:14:00]  of the whole movie.  What a useless guy that was to have in there.  He dies and no one cares.  No one cares.  No one cares.  You didn't figure out who the hell he was.  I think he was the hot chick's father.  Yeah.  Was it?  Yeah.  She didn't seem to care that he died either.  No one did.  No one cared about anybody.  And who was the Zero character?  Oh, what's her name there?  The, uh...  Here's something.  Can you explain why she wants to help the humans?  Janet Jackson. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Whatever.  Yeah, well, she seems to be some type of animal activist, like we have here on Earth.  I want you to explain...  There are some humans that are, uh, don't like it the way we treat some animals.  So there, there were some apes that don't like the way they treat humans.  But explain, like, why, how, who?  Exactly.  They could have went a little deeper with that.  Maybe there was something that happened in her past where she has this, uh, sensitivity  towards humans or something.  Yeah.  And then they had them as house servants, but then they had them as animals, and they 
[00:15:00]  were treating them like, like dirt, but then they had them in their house, handling their  food.  See, I didn't get that.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  The movie blew.  I thought so, man.  I, I, I knew it was going to, though.  Hey, I'm telling you, a dude sitting in front of me fell asleep.  He was actually snoring.  It was a riot.  A lot of people were asleep in the theater I was at.  And how come the woman that was the human rights activist, why does she have a British  accent?  What was up with that?  I don't know.  You know, I mean, weak.  Just totally weak. 
[00:15:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Sorry to hear, uh, Big Kev's question about, uh, Planet of the Apes.  Oh, where are we going?  All right.  Uh, Big Kev.  Hey, what's up?  Now, I finally saw it.  Uh-huh.  What's the question?  Where'd the horses come from?  See, a lot of people had these, like, little loose ends.  They were horses.  Now, supposedly, the apes got there because of what happened, uh, in the movie, this big  spaceship crash thing.  There were no horses on the ship.  And they said the planet was abandoned.  Right.  Nothing there except what the spaceship brought. 
[00:16:00]  And all of a sudden, there's horses.  Ah, ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Hey, you already covered my favorite part of the movie, which was when Kris Kristofferson  met a timely demise.  Timely.  That's a very timely.  It couldn't have happened quicker.  I know.  Kev, that's your only question.  Where do the horses come from?  No, that's the only one I'm going to ask.  How about the chick getting over a fear of water within seconds, and the rest of the  monkeys and apes can't figure that one out?  No, that's the only question I want to ask because I don't even give a crap enough to 
[00:16:30]  ask any other questions.  All right.  Thanks, Big Kev.  Yeah.  Now, Helena Bottom Carter, she's an ape, and they have this huge fear of water.  They cannot even go near the water.  So, the humans use it to their advantage and, like, ride horses and swim across this river,  and the apes don't follow them, won't they?  How about that?  Meanwhile, Helena Bottom Carter is on Dirk Diggler's back as they're swimming across the  river.  Now, she's petrified, but she did cross the lake and found that she was nowhere else for 
[00:17:00]  wear.  Right.  You think these big, badass gorillas and apes can't suck it up and muster up the courage  to cross the water on horseback or on a boat or something?  Another observation about the movie, who's the guy from the Green Mile, what's his name  again?  One of the main characters?  The big guy from the Green Mile.  Anthony Michael Clark.  No.  Duncan.  Michael Clark.  Anthony Michael Hall.  Duncan Clark.  Anyone else notice that all his lines were spoken through like a Halloween mask?  Yes. 
[00:17:30]  They sound like this.  They sound like Marv Albert.  Yes.  Yes.  It sounded like he was talking through a Halloween mask.  Tim, it's not working.  Hello.  Yeah.  Dub his lines or something.  This is what you're hearing as he's going after the spaceman.  Oh, beautiful.  I'm so sorry.  What?  What?  He had a little Darth Vulgar to his voice, too.  Awful.  Ridiculous.  Awful.  Awful movie. 
[00:18:00]  Awful.  Like I said, I just like the fact that it was Planet of the Apes and they updated the  costumes and the makeup.  Rick loved it.  That's it.  Rick loved it.  Well, Rick, you will know Rick will love every crappy movie.  That's the fact that I didn't say I loved it.  I said it better than I thought it was going to be.  You liked it.  Because everything going into it said this is going to suck.  Stinky liked it.  So when you go there expecting for it to suck and it doesn't really suck that bad.  Get stinky in here, too.  Earl liked it.  Earl liked it.  Earl liked it.  With all the cheesy lines, can't we all just get along? 
[00:18:30]  And then the original Planet of the Apes lines that they incorporated in, where Michael Anthony  Hall, Duncan Clark guy says, get your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human.  Don't rehash it.  And Charlton has to Lange in his deathbed.  Damn them.  Damn them all to hell.  And then he just croaks right there.  Damn them.  Damn me, you.  Them all to hell. 
[00:19:00]  What am I, an ape?  The funny thing is, I've aged so badly, they needed no makeup.  I look like a goddamn monkey.  My lines sucked.  That was awful.  I didn't need a loincloth in this one.  For my scrotum looks like a loincloth.  So stretched and weathered by time and gravity and the elements.  Look at my yam bag.  It looks like rawhide. 
[00:19:30]  Yech.  I get a scene laying in bed.  Great.  Ooh, thanks for throwing me a bone, you tool.  And why did I have to give an anti-gun message?  Everyone knows I love guns.  Humans.  Humans.  Their intelligence goes hand in hand with their cruelty.  Didn't Dr. Zayas say that to me?  I'm no, I remembered that.  And I'm senile.  What movie was this? 
[00:20:00]  Oh yes, Planet of the Apes.  I thought it was the remake of Omega Man.  And I was saying, why am I wearing a monkey mask?  People.  Soil and greedy.  People.  Soil it.  What?  Oh, sorry, Tim.  I thought it was Ben-Hur.  Oh, that's from what?  Where am I?  How many laps on this chariot do I have to make it?  Damn you.  Damn you, Tim Burton.  This movie sucks.  Damn you to hell. 
[00:20:30]  Let my people go.  Oh, wait.  I'm an ape.  That's stupid.  My people are free.  I had Nova in the original.  Nova.  I taught you to smile.  She was on the back of my horse, giving me the reach around.  And now look at this one.  I got nothing.  I lay in a bed.  I talk about a gun.  And I talk about it like I hate guns.  I love guns.  From my golden hand. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, did anyone else notice Paula Abdul's cameo?  With that, what was that big?  The big orangutan guy.  Yeah.  Whatever it was.  Paula Abdul.  Paula Abdul swinging from the chandelier topless with a furry can.  Funniest scene, man.  When she's getting ready for sex.  That was Tim Burton's squeeze there, Lisa Marie.  Eddie Trunk, what's up?  What's up, guys?  I just had a...  Saturday Night Rocks.  What's that?  Saturday Night Rocks. 
[00:21:30]  Absolutely.  What's up, Eddie?  I just had to tell you, I'm a huge Planet of the Apes fan.  Who would win in a fight?  Planet of the Apes or Kiss?  What?  I just want to know who would win in a fight.  Four of the Planet of the Apes or Kiss with their superpowers.  I don't know.  That would make a good movie, I guess.  Maybe that would be the next Kiss movie.  I don't know.  But I had to tell you...  How does Whitesnake fit into this whole Planet of the Apes thing, Eddie?  Listen, I came in Saturday.  And first of all, Earl told me he loved the film.  And I had just come from seeing it.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  Earl, why did you love the film? 
[00:22:00]  It made Earl feel empowered.  What?  Earl, why did you love the film, really?  The whole movie's a goof.  If you walk in with no expectations, you'll love the movie.  Oh, great.  You walk in with no expectations.  Everything rules.  Yeah.  I mean, that's the dumbest statement I ever heard.  When I'm plucking down 850, I don't go to the theater with no expectations.  No expectations.  I'm just an effing lot.  Anyway, when you have an original movie, you expect something.  This is Planet of the Apes, my friend.  I didn't wait for this for years.  Hey, that's how Earl talks to the boss. 
[00:22:30]  When you have no expectations of what I do, I rule.  So maybe he just looks at his movies the same way.  Then you do it.  Come on, Earl.  No expectations.  It's Planet of the Apes.  It wasn't like some movie you didn't know what it was going to be about.  I didn't expect any deep, heavy movie.  I was just like, go in and watch it as a goof.  And that's what I did.  And I had a good time.  A goof?  Oh, it was 32 years people waited for this.  For this goof.  I know.  What are you talking about, Earl?  With no expectations.  What I was calling to tell you guys, though, is like last night I was watching that Ebert 
[00:23:00]  and Roper at the movies.  Yeah.  And Richard Roper actually said that this film was better than the original.  Holy cow.  How much money did he get paid to say that?  I have no idea.  The makeup?  Yes.  That was amazing.  I wanted to tell you real quick was that Entertainment Weekly had a great point.  They were talking about the chick that played the Nova character, and they were saying that  it's the first time that 32 years has passed, and the character was actually wearing more  clothing than the one in the original 32 years ago. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they should have had her in less clothes.  I think she has a birth defect or something.  No, I've seen her in less clothes on the websites.  She is hot.  And she was actually the original girl.  Linda Harrison was actually in this film for two seconds if you saw her.  She was?  Yeah.  She was in one of the cages being carted away, and they had a quick shot of a cameo of her  as they were moving away in the car.  Damn, gravity's a bitch.  No ass.  Eddie Trunk?  How did Ronnie James Dio like the movie?  I don't know, man. 
[00:24:00]  I'll see if I can get back to you on that.  All right, man.  All right, man.  Thank you, Eddie.  See you guys.  Eddie Trunk does Saturday Night Rocks here in New York.  That's right.  Does a good job at that.  Earl, why did you like the movie?  Seriously.  There you go.  No expectations.  What else?  Because it was free.  That, too.  Oh, he went to the free screening?  Free, like my people.  Let them go.  Jay, what's going on?  Free them from Pharaoh.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Jay.  Well, I knew it was bad when you leaned over to me eight times during the movie to say,  dude, are you awake?  Oh, this is Jay. 
[00:24:30]  Hi, Jay.  What's up, Jay?  Jay.  No, that chick was hot, man.  Yeah.  She was smoking hot, but Mary Pickford used to have more lines in her movies.  A Mary Pickford reference.  Holy Jesus.  Did you actually consider that, you know, part of her resume?  No.  Don't you have to speak?  No, Ash.  I had a problem with Chris Christopherson, too.  Yeah?  I don't think that was scripted.  I mean, you don't have a big star like that dies in the first 20 minutes.  I think he realized the movie was so bad, he just killed himself right then and 
[00:25:00]  ran into the ape.  No, you're supposed to keep running with your people.  Screw this.  No, I want out of this mess right now.  I got one more problem.  Yeah.  If I'm not mistaken, did that orangutan ape not have ice in his glass?  Ice, yes.  They had ice.  He was tinkling ice in the glass.  Where did that come from?  Same place the horses came from.  They didn't have electricity, right?  No.  Yeah, so how did they make ice?  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  And there wasn't any snow-capped mountains there.  No.  So, I had a problem with that.  I think they did have electricity in the kitchen.  You know, it was all lit up, but you didn't have any fire torches.  No, I saw, like, torches when he cut that one lamp down or whatever it is, that big  chandelier thing, it burst into flames.  Was that electric, though?  I don't think so.  No, it wasn't electric.  No.  It wasn't electric?  No.  No.  All right.  Just four small problems.  If they had electric, they wouldn't need those big, dopey locks on the human cages with 
[00:26:00]  the big, dopey key that Dirk Diggler could pick with his schlong.  In two seconds, he was through that one.  All right, Jay.  Take it easy.  Later, Jack.  There he goes, Jay.  A buddy Jay.  Look at that.  Him checking in.  It's like the old days.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, Matt.  Matt.  He has a good point, but all right.  He says, how the hell did they become gorillas when they all started off as chimps?  Yeah, well, I guess they had some baby gorillas and orangutans on the big ship, and they were  genetically altered, Opie. 
[00:26:30]  That's how they went back to the future.  Back to the future with apes.  I'm telling you, man.  Dirk Diggler.  Want to go back in time.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  We have to take our first break, eh?  We can continue a little bit on this.  I haven't seen one good movie this summer.  Well, put a wire on the clock tower.  Yeah.  I am 0 for like 6 at this point.  You hate every movie.  Mummy Returns, Blue. 
[00:27:00]  I like the Mummy Returns.  I like the Mummy Returns.  Except for the kid.  Didn't like the kid.  I like that.  But...  I like Memento, right?  Planet of the Apes.  That was a summer.  And Rick liked Chocolat.  And Rick liked the Chocolat.  Chocolat.  The Chocolat.  Which is the French title for Planet of the Apes.  The Chocolat.  Chocolat.  Ready?  3, 2, 1.  Opie and Anthony.

[00:29:00]  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  If you're not in the New York area and you want to get a hold of us, 866-277-4.  Wow.  Reggie, what's going on?  Reggie.  Freddie.  Freddie?  Whatever.  Freddie.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Oh, good, Freddie. 
[00:29:30]  Uncle Freddie.  I just want to say, this is Dr. Silly.  My friend just turned me on to you guys about a month or so ago.  You guys are great.  Love you guys.  Thank you, Freddie.  What do you got?  Okay.  Now, the only people that are afraid of water, right?  One shit gets on back.  Mark Warburg's back.  One's to the water, whatever.  Couldn't follow his story with the phone lines.  His phone was all screwy.  Let's try James.  James, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  What's up? 
[00:30:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Maybe you can explain this to me.  Yeah.  They crash on this unknown, desolate planet, right?  Yeah.  And then Mark Warburg, whatever, he goes back to Earth.  It's a completely different planet.  How come there were apes there?  How did that planet, other planet, get affected?  Hey, dopey ass.  Didn't you listen to my Back to the Future 2 analogy?  It's a different planet.  He could go back to the future.  He'd be on that same planet.  No, he wouldn't.  He flew back to Earth.  He went through time and space.  He went back to Earth.  Rent up back to the future.  So then he gets to Earth, and there's like a million humans all over the place. 
[00:30:30]  No, there's apes, you douchebag.  Because Thade got there first.  Right back to the future.  Thade's Biff.  Right.  Marky Mark, Dirk Dingler, Diggler is Marty McFly.  That's it.  That's all you got to know.  We explained it.  The pods, the little space pods is the DeLorean.  It works perfectly if you use that.  Adam.  Okay?  Adam, what's up?  Yo, all I want to know is I want to thank you guys. 
[00:31:00]  Why?  About a month ago, ONA, you guys said that this movie was going to be released late.  It was going to suck.  You guys said Pearl Harbor came out Memorial Day, and then I don't know what came out the  fourth.  And you guys said this movie was going to bomb, and I'm glad I listened to you.  Dirk Dingler, you have to get to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.  All right, I'm going to go listen to myself later.  Dirk Dingler.  We're trying to find someone that enjoyed the movie, but so far, uh...  He should have just smacked people with a Dirk Dingler big, huge junk that he pulled 
[00:31:30]  out at the end of the Boogie Nights.  Just start smacking the apes around with this junk.  Dirk Dingler.  How bummed are the girls when they finally get Marky Mark in bed and realize that was a  prop for the movie?  Marky Mark.  What happened, Marky Mark?  Marky Mark, what happened to your junk?  I saw the movie.  It looked huge.  What happened, Mark?  You got the Irish curse, Marky Mark.  Brother. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  Awful.  Vinny, I need some feedback.  I'm wondering if Bill Clinton is feeling what Mark Wahlberg felt in the movie today.  Oh!  Ouch!  We got to be really careful how we explain this to everybody.  Well, we saw he was, um, today opening up his brand new offices in, uh, Harlem.  He's up in Harlem now.  He was going to get, uh, office space right across from our station here in New York, at  Carnegie Hall, which would have ruled.  Madison, son of a bitches, how you doing?  Oh, and I'll be up later when you got the lesbian couch. 
[00:32:30]  You guys go to the Crystal Cafe.  I'll go with you.  I need a fight team myself.  Hey, baby Ray Ray, could you get me a Snapple?  You know, it would have been great.  It would have been in our neighborhood.  But he bowed to the pressure that, uh, it was costing too much money.  Mm-hmm.  For some reason.  I don't know.  And, uh, he went up to Harlem.  He called his buddy, Charlie Wrangel, and said, hey, yo, what's up, my nigga?  Can I get some office space up here, yo? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I hear that.  I love the guy.  Yeah, he's fantastic.  But now, you know, watching him, uh, give his speech in Harlem, there was not one white  person around him on the stage or in the audience.  The only white people were the reporters that were reporting.  Swear to God.  And you, you were watching him, and after going to the movies this weekend, all I could imagine  was him going, my pod just crashed in the, uh, river up here.  And I, what happened?  What, what happened? 
[00:33:30]  I, I tore my space suit, and I gotta get back somehow.  I don't know what happened.  Well, that's what, that's what they're instant feedbacking, Opie.  Why do you do this?  Bone dry, yeah.  Bone dry, yeah.  What does he need an office for, anyway?  What, Clinton?  Hey, uh, old dirty, what?  It works better when you're talking to a man.  Oh, yeah, no doubt.  Yo, what, number one, what does he need an office for?  He's a big businessman. 
[00:34:00]  What's he doing?  He's giving speeches.  No, he needs that office so he can get a little action.  You know what I'm saying?  He needs some tail.  That's the little love nest of tail.  You don't see the big oak disk, I'm gonna bang your fat ass right on.  This guy has been in New York probably a couple dozen times since leaving office.  We have not seen him with his wife once.  Oh, no.  And she is the senator from New York.  From New York.  He gave some cockamamie excuse today.  You know, uh, the junior senator from New York would have loved to have been here.  He didn't, he never said Hillary today.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  In his speech, didn't say it.  He goes, the junior senator in Chelsea would have loved to have been here today,  but, uh, there was, uh, she, uh, her homework got eaten by the dog or something.  Like, he came up with some lame excuse.  But it's an excuse every time.  She is never with this guy anymore.  Now he's got his posh office space.  I'm gonna get me some of that tan bass.  Let me tell you, I'm gonna ride that tan bass.  Hey, Ben, you still there?  He loves it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's up?  Yo, yaddle doodle, yaddle doodle.  So, um, does the Opie and Anthony drinking game apply when Anthony does an impression 
[00:35:00]  of Opie?  Let'sbunch.com.  When did I, uh, do an impression of Opie?  No, if I did an impression of Opie, no.  Would not, you wouldn't have to.  Wow, we got a lot of tools calling in today for some reason.  You guys usually help us out nicely.  Yeah.  Anthony, we got some clips of, uh, the president in Harlem.  Real clips.  Real clips.  Here we go.  Now I feel like I'm home.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Some people used to clean up the White House were black.  I want to thank my pal, Cicely Tyson, for being here today.  She did a great job under not the easiest circumstances.  Maybe we should give her another acting award.  What?  Another acting award or something like that.  Hey, shut up.  I don't have my speech right.  There's no more.  An acting award or maybe a Golden Globe.  Like, what is the, I think he means Academy Award.  Grammy.  And, while this was going on in the background, you know, I'm answering an email and I'm kind 
[00:36:00]  of listening with a half an ear and they're bringing these people one by one up to welcome  the president to Harlem.  Yeah.  I swear to God, I even turned to either Ben or Stinky and I go, why is Whoopi Goldberg  going on the stage and doing like 10 or 12 different characters?  Swear to God.  I didn't even realize it was for real.  I really thought it was, I thought it was just Whoopi Goldberg doing, you know, all  these different voices.  No, no, no.  More audio.  I want to thank Charlie Rangel. 
[00:36:30]  I never will forget.  Yeah.  I was sitting one morning in South Florida and I picked up the phone and I called Charlie  and I said, you think you could find me some office space in Harlem?  He said, did the sun come up this morning?  You think you could find me some office space in Harlem?  It waited 24 hours?  Here we were.  And I went, oh damn, it did it. 
[00:37:00]  24 hours?  What took him so long?  You think you could find me some office space in Harlem, yo?  Because I need office space that's off the hook, yo.  He ain't nothing but a hillbilly mother.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, well.  He's a true hillbilly.  He'd probably make moonshine and all that.  I'll tell you though, you got to give the guy credit.  He does.  He embraces and loves the black community.  He really does.  And really loves.  Let me tell you.  He likes the chitlins and the pig's feet.  No, he likes some booty. 
[00:37:30]  He likes some of the black booty.  He likes a little...  I really think so.  A little brown sugar.  Yeah, baby.  All right, here's more audio of the former president talking about his wife, Anthony.  Yeah.  I also want to bring you greetings from two people who are not here.  New York's junior senator.  And our daughter, Chelsea, had to stay in Washington today because my mother-in-law had surgery this morning. 
[00:38:00]  And we couldn't reschedule that.  So I ask for your prayers for her.  And I want you to know they're thinking of you.  And now New York has two great senators.  I'm proud of both of them.  Oh, he's got to kiss her fat, white, dimpled ass.  Every second now.  Every second he's got to bring her up.  But he didn't even say her name.  Yeah, she's the one who's bringing home the paychecks.  Yeah, no way.  Did you hear this?  Did you read in the paper? 
[00:38:30]  Bill Clinton keeps $1 million in his basic checking account.  It said he was a whiz in the White House, but he's not too much of a whiz on how to invest his money.  A million...  You know, your checking account doesn't pay you anything.  It's trash.  It's in there to write checks on.  And you know how they found this out?  I read this on Drudge over the weekend.  Someone that works for the Post was with him when he went to the ATM to take some money out.  Beep, beep, beep.  Oh, I'm a password.  Beep, beep.  And looked and saw the balance.  It says, you have $1 million-some-odd in your account. 
[00:39:00]  Amazing.  He keeps it in his checking.  I need some money.  That's a hillbilly move right there.  I'm surprised he doesn't have the passbook.  Could I withdraw $10 from my million here?  Make sure you stamp my passbook.  Sergeant Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey.  Hey, it feels so right at home in Harlem.  Why all the police and Secret Service protection up there, right?  He gets that everywhere.  Yeah, right.  And you know why Hillary wasn't there? 
[00:39:30]  Because she was afraid of all the brothers.  They haven't seen a fine piece of white ass up in there in a long time.  Oh, come on.  I think they like Hillary's ass.  Jay checking in.  It says, mother-in-law had surgery.  Didn't she die in another excuse once?  Yeah.  My mother-in-law had surgery on her leg because she had a car accident.  And she hurt her eye.  And she had an eye patch on.  And she took it off.  And there was no scar.  So we fired her. 
[00:40:00]  My mother-in-law.  Yo, my mother-in-law is so fat.  Woo!  Woo!  Showtime at the Apollo.  Yo, he's probably going to show up over at the Apollo.  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  For amateur night, kid.  He comes out.  And who's that?  Sandman comes out and grabs him with the hook and then wipes off the log.  He's stinking up the joint.  Let me tell him.  No, no.  Yo, yo.  You notice he's sounding more Southern now that he's out of the way out there? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  I call up Charlie Rangel.  Goddamn, let me tell you something.  God, tell you.  I'll say, you get me a goddamn office building up there in Harlem?  Let's hear some more audio from Clinton's little trip to Harlem today.  Hillary called me about 10 minutes before I came out here to make sure I was going to say the right thing.  Yeah, that's why.  Do the right thing.  And tell you how miserable she is.  She's not here with you.  Oh, how miserable she is.  You could have stopped them for that.  Somebody drop her a note and tell her I gave a good account of myself today.  Will you do that?  Will you do that?  He's telling them to write Hillary a note saying Bill did a good job. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, my God.  This poor guy is so whipped.  You know what?  He's one of the most powerful men in the world still.  He's making money hand over fist doing these speeches.  He goes somewhere and makes over a million bucks just to open his gap at some of these events.  And he still has to kiss that cauliflower ass of Hillary everywhere he goes.  You know, Hillary would have loved to have been here, but she's just a C and I hate her.  I mean, oh, damn. 
[00:41:30]  Tell her to write me a note.  Write a note.  Tell her I've done good, please.  You don't know what it is to live with this bitch.  Please just say I've done good and I wasn't touching none of your black asses.  Please.  Could you please tell her that?  That's his alibi.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, he had an alibi.  Hey, I was giving a speech.  And now you write.  And please write in your note that I was in public doing a speech between 8 and 10 last night.  Because I really need that.  And there ain't any good doctors for venereal disease around here. 
[00:42:00]  Because I feel a little itchy and the dripping's starting and it's stinging.  More audio.  I am honored to be in Harlem, in New York City, in New York State.  The United States on the Earth.  You voted for me in 1992 and 1996.  You voted for Hillary in 2000.  You were there on the darkest days and the best days.  And I want you to know, I want to be a good neighbor in Harlem on the best days and the dark days for all the people who live here. 
[00:42:30]  That's a little racist.  You shouldn't be using the word dark.  Oh.  I'm all like, you're not thinking it, though.  I'm here on the dark days.  Wow.  I wonder what floor he's on in that building.  Yeah.  He took the high ground, right?  Yeah.  I'm moving on up.  I want some things on the roof that go, agag, agag, agag, agag.  Pay me money.  Dick.  Dick.  Bill loves New York, though. 
[00:43:00]  He really does.  He's out partying all the time.  He was with Elizabeth Hurley, seen recently with Elizabeth Hurley.  He was hanging with U2, drinking at some bar.  This guy's got the life.  Hey, Vano, I got a million dollars in my goddamn chicken account.  What you got?  What you got?  You know, I really like Joshua Tree, but pop sucked.  You just see him hanging out, though?  Hey, Liz, come here.  Sit on my lap.  Would you like to be on the presidential staff? 
[00:43:30]  Let me just unzip my fly.  He's great, man.  How about you, too?  Edge, come here.  Give me that.  Let me show you how you should have played that line.  He is having the time of his life.  He looks good, too.  He looks like he lost weight.  He looks younger now.  We were talking about that.  It looks like he's definitely keeping himself in better health.  And he doesn't have the stress and pressure of the press looking at everything he does. 
[00:44:00]  True.  Woo!  I love it when this comes on the jukebox.  Hey, Vano, you want another Guinness?  Come on, pussy, drink up.  You're a fag, man.  I'm already down 12 of these goddamn things.  You see Liz Hurley's back there.  I bet you, hey, come here, Vano.  I bet you I tagged that ass before the end of the night.  I bet you.  But now you guys got to back me up because that scene Hillary catches me doing this is going to be hell to pay.  I have run through the fields only to be with you. 
[00:44:30]  I have a call here for Bill Clinton.  Bill Clinton.  No, Taylor, I'm not here.  I just left, though.  I just left.  I have a call here for Bill Clinton.  Alcoholic!  Alcoholic!  Sally Creeper!  Hanging with you, too.  This guy's living it. 
[00:45:00]  You know, and he's really the first president.  Because years ago, the president got out of office.  He was an old bastard.  And that was it.  Yeah, they were gone.  This guy just, mm, I'm tagging.  Hey, baby, I was the president.  Yeah, he came to me.  And you know I like the VJs.  And he came to New York.  He can't run away from the press.  They're going to be parked up in front of his office.  He can get it.  Look at what he is.  He's the former president.  Very likable guy.  And all the girls know what he loves sexually. 
[00:45:30]  He's in.  Like, they walk up to him just with their mouths open.  Come on.  Get in line.  Look, Bono, I'm getting more than you.  And you're the singer.  You, too.  Another Guinness.  Another round of Guinness.  Faggot.  Come on.  Drink up, faggot.  Come here, Charlie Rangel.  What you doing?  I know the independent contractors up in Harlem ain't feeling his presence, though.  Too much secret service.  A lot of federales up there.  Yeah, but he's not going to be up there a lot. 
[00:46:00]  Of course.  He's going to be in his office, right?  No.  I think he's going to go to his office every day.  Every day.  Reagan did.  Chop a club.  What else is he going to do?  I'm just going to sit home and scratch my butt crack.  You know?  He goes to the office to make it look like he's doing things.  He travels a lot, but I think when he's home, he's going to be in his office.  He's been traveling the world.  He should be the new host of Wild On.  On the E channel.  That would be good, right?  I'm in Bombay.  Look at me.  I'm in Bombay.  This is great. 
[00:46:30]  We're going to take you to some of the strip clubs I got here.  This is great.  We're going to see nine-year-old boys that do everything.  We're going to see girls that shoot darts out of there.  They could hit a balloon on your head, I swear to God.  Imagine if he was the host of Wild On.  That'd rock.  Hugest ratings in TV history.  A girl shoots a dart out of there and the Secret Service just pounces on her.  Drop it.  Drop the veg.  We have more audio of Clinton's little visit to Harlem today.  You know, when I was a little boy, Marcus Garvey and Langston Hughes, the Abyssinian Baptist 
[00:47:00]  Church in the Apollo Theater, and I dreamed when I was a young musician that one day I  might be like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington.  Dead in black.  Well, I never made it to play at the Apollo, but I have eaten at Sylvia's.  Yeah!  Don't be so cool, kid.  What? 
[00:47:30]  No, Bill.  And I ain't dead yet.  I may play there yet before it's over.  Oh, my God.  If he picks up that effing saxophone and trots out on that stage, he can act out.  All right.  That was a marginal eff.  He'd be nice.  It's just hilarious how southern he sounds.  I know.  Just putting all those words together.  I'm being nice. 
[00:48:00]  It's just he doesn't sound like the kind of guy.  He is definitely sincere.  I am giving it to him 100%.  The guy's sincere.  But as far as this is concerned, no, don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying everything he said is sincere.  But, you know, it just looks silly.  When you see they brought a band out after he was done with his speech,  and they start playing,  and Bill Clinton starts doing that stupid white guy clapping dance thing  to, like, some real soulful music that's going on on stage. 
[00:48:30]  And what's his name?  Charles Schumer.  Charles Schumer.  Oh, Chuck Schumer is out there,  and he's clapping his hands and trying to look cool.  And it looks so stupid.  It just doesn't look good.  Fake, right.  Fake.  Like that movie that Steve Martin was in, man.  What was his name?  The Jerk.  Yeah, The Jerk.  Yeah, and he's the white guy.  You know what I'm saying?  Black family.  It does.  That's what Clinton's like now.  I was born a poor black man. 
[00:49:00]  I think Clinton's going to run a prostitute house up in that office.  I thought I told you I had to get back to 125.  Don't come back here with no money.  You holding out on me, ho?  Come on.  You know you're my favorite, bitch.  Come on.  Who you go home to?  Let me go to Uncle John.  I gots me a fat hoopie.  It's like the General Lee.  Oh, don't go up there with that Confederate flag.  General Lee.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, could you picture Clinton on stage, the Apollo, and that guy in the clown suit comes 
[00:49:30]  out with a club and is like beating him off the stage?  Yeah.  Sandman comes out.  Hey, what you doing?  What you doing over there?  That'd be hysterical, man.  He beats him off the stage with the cane and then wipes the log off.  Nice.  Thank you, guys.  We have a couple more clips.  Just one more.  One more.  This is Bill doing some shtick, right?  Oh.  Oh, two more?  Is this one good?  Yeah.  I'll try.  Go ahead.  You know, when you're not president anymore, people look at you funny when you walk by them  in the airport.  They say things like, you look just like Bill Clinton, or didn't you used to be Bill Clinton 
[00:50:00]  as if you couldn't possibly exist without all that other stuff, you know?  He's using the propabonics, though.  I doubt he's just walking through airports.  Come on.  Who is she kidding?  Meanwhile, if he did that material at the Apollo Theater, it would look like they electrified  the chairs.  You ever see someone when they got a comic in the Apollo that's really hot, and everyone 
[00:50:30]  starts laughing?  I swear to God, it looks like they just jolted about 50,000 volts through every seat.  Everyone just...  Everyone just explodes.  Boom.  All right.  One more clip.  Or maybe they'd run up to the stage like when Joe was performing up there.  All the chicks...  Oh, it's Joe!  God damn!  Gotta see Joe up close.  And they all, like, run toward the stage.  Let me find out you were watching.  Gotta see Joe up close.  You find out you were watching last Saturday. 
[00:51:00]  I watch Showtime at the Apollo every week, man.  Hell yeah!  It's a funny show.  I love that stuff.  I love when the people bomb.  I love when they come out and bomb, and the chicks in the audience start doing the stuff  where they, you know, they take bold hands straight up in the air and then wave them over.  Like they're waving a 747 off of the carmack.  Get off the stage!  Get off the stage!  Get off the stage!  Get off!  I like when they make fun of Whitey myself.  Oh, I...  That's always fun.  They do it a lot, though.  Hell, they do it a lot.  Not anymore.  I like the guys that come out and go,  Yo, what do you do, man? 
[00:51:30]  I'm a dancer.  I'm a dancer.  And you hear everybody in the crowd go,  Oh, man!  I'm gonna do a little dance for you tonight here at the Apollo.  And the guy is like just a flaming fag.  Gets out and starts doing these dances.  And the people are like,  Get off the stage!  Once again, the 767's over to the air.  Get off the tarmac.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Clinton just sounds like a blabbering idiot without his speechwriters.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's kind of tough listening to him. 
[00:52:00]  It's the new casual Clinton.  I don't need no speechwriters.  I'm a regular guy.  He's a regular guy now.  I'm in the airport, and people are like,  Hey, didn't you used to be Bill Clinton?  God damn, yeah, I guess I was.  You guys are like, guys.  Think you're old.  Like his protocol, people probably told him,  You gotta keep the Southern accent down to a minimum, Mr. Clinton.  Oh, anyway, yeah.  It's all over now.  Let's get the last clip on, because we've got to take a break.  We have a band that's going to rock and roll today for us, man.  Nice.  All right, which one is this? 
[00:52:30]  Whatever.  More Clinton.  Okay.  Harlem always struck me as a place that was human and alive.  Where there was a rhythm to life and a song in the heart.  Yeah.  Where no matter how bad it was, people held up their heads and went on.  Hold your head up.  And where when things got good, people were grateful and cared about their names.  Yes, sir.  Mm-hmm.  You were always there for me.  Oh, yeah, you were.  And I will try to be there for you. 
[00:53:00]  I am.  And together, we can be there for all of our neighbors around the block, around the country,  and around the world.  I love Bill.  Thank you.  God bless you.  I feel at home.  Thank you.  He just said nothing.  He's a speech writer.  I've got to say, people held their heads up high.  It's great.  And, well, I'm here and whatever.  There was nothing in that.  Hillary Jr.  You're standing there in Chelsea and bum legs on the mother-in-law. 
[00:53:30]  What a hack.  He's doing plain jokes.  How about them aircraft peanuts?  I've got to tell you, what's with the peanuts?  I was sitting in coach and, boy, there's no leg room there.  Let me tell you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm going to be at Caroline's this weekend with the Iron Sheik.  We're going to have the Iron Sheik here today.  Are we going to get the Iron Sheik?  I don't know.  All right. 
[00:54:00]  We're going to line that up.  Bill Clinton, I hear, is joining the Kings of Comedy Tour.  Is that true?  Any funny how white people walk?  What's with that walk on the white people?  Like they've got a stick on their butt or something.  Damn.  Larry.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  This guy never stops with women.  I read in some paper that he went to some country, and one of the girls came up to him,  and she asked for an autograph.  He signed it, gave the autograph back, and she said, can I have a hug? 
[00:54:30]  And as he's hugging her, he's saying, you deserve more than that, baby.  Oh, man.  All right, guys.  Good luck.  Thank you.  You've got to love that, though.  Maybe I should approach the former president and see if he wants to open up a personal account with myself.  The bank of OJ.  Free delivery, you know what I'm saying?  I got a million dollars.  Hey, Fred, what's up?  Hey, I just flew in from Washington, and boy, am my arms hurting. 
[00:55:00]  You're just great people.  That's what you can get on my new CD, Bill Clinton's comedy CD.  And let me tell you, hey, at least it's not Norris, okay?  Bill Clinton, I'm killing over here.  Nice. 
[00:55:30]  Fantastic.  Bill Clinton.  Can't wait.  Can't wait for more Clinton sound clips and news now that his offices are right there up in Harlem.  He's right uptown, okay?  Yeah.  There you go.  Is our band ready today?  Not yet.  Okay.  We're going to rock today a little bit, man.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Dirty.  Cowbell Bill.  Nice to do.

And a band that's going to rock your socks off in a few minutes.  Yeah, open that door.  They're like...  Soundcheck.  Yeah, they're doing a soundcheck.  As loud as F out there.  The building's going to hate us. 
[00:58:00]  Also, the Playboy's out with Jerry from Survivor 2.  Yo, where's the...  Wait, you can't find her?  Yeah, that always sucks about Playboy.  You try to find something in there, you can never find it.  Yo, this body being airbrushed, kid.  Yeah.  I'm not digging that at all.  I'm not feeling that.  Still don't cover it.  You don't like the preciouses?  Nah, look at those things, O.D.  You can hang your coat off those nips.  Oh, yeah.  She's got the big, gnarly, pinky tip nip things going. 
[00:58:30]  That's all right, though.  You guys are out of your minds.  What's the problem?  You've got to be solid.  Right?  No, no, no.  You know something?  Jim, I'm not taking your word.  I've seen what you go after.  Jim, I'm not denying the fact you'd throw that down after a night hanging out at a bar or something like that.  Yeah, and that would be a nice catch.  But we're talking Playboy.  That's all right.  In Swank, she would be a killer.  She'd be a hit.  Oh, yeah.  But, you know, Playboy, you're now putting yourself against, look at the centerfold, O.D.  Turn to the centerfold.  Now you tell me something. 
[00:59:00]  There you go.  Yeah.  See?  That's Playboy.  That's Playboy.  Oh, no doubt.  You've got to put her in a magazine where the next shot is a disgusting hair-filled cave shot.  You know what I mean?  One of those big, stretchy pictures.  I can't get past the teeth thing.  They look all grinded down and stuff.  What, hers?  Yeah, something's going on with her teeth.  You're looking at her teeth.  I've got to be honest, I didn't notice her teeth.  I noticed it during the show.  What's up with her toothuses, yo?  Hey, Kimmy.  Hey.  Our pal is on the line. 
[00:59:30]  Kimmy from Survivor.  What's going on?  Kimmy, you could have done a much better job in Playboy.  Why didn't you go for it?  We've seen you naked.  I know you have, but if you look at her boobs in Playboy, and you guys have seen my boobs.  Her boobs look like as big as mine, you know?  Yeah, but they're not quite as perky.  Yeah, she's, I don't know.  I mean, it looks good.  I mean, it's a very simple kind of spread.  I mean, I think, like, the background is kind of boring, but she looks good against the blue.  She's all right.  Jim, you've seen both girls naked now. 
[01:00:00]  Who has the hotter body?  Kimmy from Survivor or Jerry?  Kimmy definitely has the hotter body, but I like Jerry better because I still think I have a shot at banging Jerry.  Oh.  You totally turned, uh...  No, Kimmy off?  She's definitely hotter.  No, she's definitely hotter.  Kimmy, where have you been?  Why do you say you're going to come down and then you don't show up?  Well, you know what it was?  My little niece had some little problems.  My little niece had a problem.  But she's okay.  We found out.  She had what?  What happened to her?  She was having, like, these really bad headaches and everything, and she had to, like, go have an MRI and some CAT scans and everything. 
[01:00:30]  But it turns out that she's okay.  My sister just calls me.  But, you know, she's four, so...  No, I'm glad she's doing okay.  Yeah, yeah.  That wasn't me laughing this time.  And I'll take responsibility for that.  I thought she was 18.  Oh, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, she's almost old enough for you.  She's four.  You cure that by smashing their head on the corner of a porcelain sink.  But, no, I'm going to come in in, like, a week or so, because I did a photo shoot for Edge magazine where it's a little bit... 
[01:01:00]  You know, I kept my clothes on, but it's a little bit racy and fun and playful.  Racy.  Yeah, baby.  Kimmy, you weren't even approached by Playboy?  Playboy had talked to us through CBS, and, yes, I was one of the people that they talked to.  So, why didn't you take it off?  We all know you're not shy.  Honestly, I think that the money that they were coming out with, I'd like to, you know, do something more serious.  How much did they offer?  They were starting in the area of about $300,000, and that's really not, like, a lot of money. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You need a pit to work that much.  Exactly.  I mean, even if they were doing, like, $400,000 or so, I mean, after taxes and everything, it's really not that much money.  Take it or run.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  What did the Edge thing give you?  Edge magazine.  A good time, baby.  And no money?  Um, I don't know.  We haven't even heard of the Edge.  I know.  It's a new magazine.  It's only been out a couple months.  Did they give you $200,000?  I did it in Vegas, so I went out to Vegas.  Did they give you $200,000? 
[01:02:00]  No, but I kept my clothes on.  Yeah, but what's the deal?  Well, who cares?  Kimmy, you have morals all of a sudden?  No, no, no.  You know what?  It's because I want to do something, you know, hosting a wildlife or environmental show or something.  So, for me, if I did Playboy, I have to wait a couple years until I'm really, really worth something, and then I can ask for a million bucks.  You know, Jerry is pretty desperate.  She wants...  No, she really is.  She wants to be famous so bad.  So bad.  And then she's like, all right, I'll go for the Playboy thing right away.  What do you want to...  What kind of nature show do you want to do?  Like the Crocodile Hunter? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, I want to be out in the bingo.  No, I'd really...  I mean, that's what I went to school for and everything, and I want to do something with wildlife or environmental documentaries.  All right, we'll get you in a magazine where you can do a pig or something.  No?  It's not the kind of wildlife thing you want to do?  Right, well, Peter asked me...  We'll have you with a pony.  Peter asked me to do a vegetarian campaign with a pig.  We'll have you do the new horse gag video.  Blah!  Blah!  Who hasn't downloaded the horse gag video?  And right at the point where she goes... 
[01:03:00]  Blah!  Just laugh their yam bags off.  Blah!  It's like a spit take from a vaudeville comedy.  Kimmy, what did you say about Peter?  Oh, Peter wanted me to pose with a pig for a Go Vegetarian campaign.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That's...  That's...  Woohoo!  Wow, that's just as big as being in Playboy.  You're on your way to the top.  I think that when you guys see the pictures that I did in Edge magazine, you guys will actually like them.  Can we spank to them, you think?  Are they spank-worthy?  I think they're spankable. 
[01:03:30]  Some of them are definitely spankable.  Because it was so funny, because I was in Vegas when we did the photo shoot, and in some of the shots I'm wearing lingerie, and we were just running around Vegas, like, jumping out of the car, having the pictures taken, and then, like, jumping back in the car, because you're not supposed to do, like, you know, commercial photography in Vegas.  Right.  What type of shenanigans were going on there?  All kinds.  All kinds of no-good nonsense.  You piped down over there, Norton.  You just piped down.  Oh, boy, oh, boy.  For the love of me.  Oh, gosh.  What do you think you're doing over there? 
[01:04:00]  But it was so funny, because I was wearing, like, these big, huge, like, F-Me pumps.  Yeah.  And little shorts.  Is that big mouth of yours nice and open?  Oh, yeah, and a couple of them, they're open.  That's good.  I like when you open that up.  Oh, yeah.  But just, like, walking through the casinos, like, we were walking through Paris and the Bellagio and stuff, and I had, like, four or five guys with me, and I had, like, my hair all done.  I had, like, really, like, big makeup on.  You guys know I don't, like, wear tons of makeup.  And I was just, like, walking around, and everybody's head was turning, like, oh, my God, who is this? 
[01:04:30]  He's a sinner.  And it was, like, people were taking their small children out of the hotel.  Don't look at her.  In Vegas?  In Vegas.  They're used to seeing that crap.  But not, like, just, like, through the casino.  Did you have sexual intercourse with anybody that night?  No, I did not.  Why not?  When was the last time you had sex, Kimmy?  Didn't know.  What do you think?  What time is it?  A couple hours ago.  Really?  What celebrity's life did you ruin this time?  Be nice to me.  Any celebrities recently hitting on you?  Oh, can I tell you a funny story? 
[01:05:00]  Absolutely.  You know who I actually ran into the other, last week, twice?  Who?  Kevin James?  Kevin James.  What did he say?  You know, nothing.  We just kind of, like, looked at each other.  No, but it was funny, because one night he was up at Wall Street, and it was just really  funny, because we ended up just, like, talking to each other.  And I'm like, I didn't tell everybody that we were doing it.  Oh, what did he say?  He's like, he's like...  Did he believe you?  Yeah.  I think he was a little surprised. 
[01:05:30]  Kimmy has never officially admitted that she did Kevin James.  I will admit that she did Kevin James.  But I'm pardoned him.  Based on all the facts.  Kimmy?  What?  Did you do Kevin James?  Yeah.  Got it.  Right?  Yeah, just admit it.  Yeah, just press it.  I did not do Kevin James.  Oh, now she's totally back and down.  You couldn't say that the whole day you were here.  You couldn't say that, Kimmy.  You fess up to it, or we'll tell the other one.  No, you will not.  Well, then you fess up to Kevin.  Tell the truth.  Okay, fine.  Fine.  I banged Kevin. 
[01:06:00]  Okay.  You cannot go ruin people's lives.  Yeah, we can.  All right, Kevin.  It's always funny.  You guys are so bad.  Don't you have something new to torture me with, like some new whipped cream?  We have a trail of chop meat through this show.  It's just behind us.  Hey, did you give Kevin James the hepatitis slurpee?  Oh, my God.  That's my new favorite Jim Norton saying.  The hepatitis slurpee.  He'd have to give it to her.  Oh, my God.  You guys are so bad. 
[01:06:30]  But, no, I'm going to come down there and bring you, like, my pictures and everything.  All right.  We would love to see you and your pictures.  Yeah, and I want to come down on a Friday because I want to give a big F you Friday to,  uh, Saturn of Smithtown, this bunch of rejects.  No, we extended the whole F you thing all week, so.  Oh, good.  Well, then we can F you Saturn of Smithtown.  What do they do?  Deny you?  You know, you know what?  They're just idiots.  Like, they had some guy totally rip me off in my car.  Like, they went and they took my car in December telling me that I needed, like, a whole new  motor in the side of my door.  Went and I got, I bought the motor. 
[01:07:00]  It turns out that's not what I needed.  I needed a switch.  When you're, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  You guys are horrible.  So, you're telling a fascinating story about a switch?  Fascinating.  Fascinating story.  You know what, Kimmy?  One time I was driving and I was trying to get through a light, right?  And this guy is going really slow and I'm like, are you going to hurry up?  Do you understand here?  Yeah.  I'm sorry, Jim.  Jim, I'll make it more racy and exciting for you. 
[01:07:30]  Let's, let's think of something new we can cover my body in.  Wow, Jim.  Gasoline.  You hit that, dude?  Gasoline.  Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll throw more stuff on you.  Yeah, we got, we got to play some more.  We got to play.  Kimmy, I, honestly, I would rather see you in Playboy than Jerry.  Yep.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, without a doubt.  See, because you guys know me now and, but like, it wasn't always like that.  Remember back in the day before you even knew me?  No, we just said that you sounded really annoying and that opinion hasn't changed.  We think you're really hot. 
[01:08:00]  Well, we just like you now.  First impressions always last.  I mean, why couldn't we get Colleen in the, in the Playboy?  Yeah.  Or Amber.  Or Amber.  Jerry.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know, but I mean, I think that Jerry, I mean, Jerry's eyes look amazing with  the background and her body's cute, so.  Nobody cares about her eyes.  Yeah, ain't seeing it.  Ain't cutting it to me.  You know what, Jerry would be great in Playboy?  Blair's cousin.  Big gnarly crusty nip.  And the facts of life.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That would rock.  In the wheelchair or thrown out onto the floor naked.  Just naked. 
[01:08:30]  Old palsy box.  Oh, no.  The palsy box.  Because it's Jerry, that's right.  Didn't the magazine, I think it was Hustler, do a centerfold with a paraplegic?  Remember?  And she was laying out on the bed and they had to pose her legs.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  How great is that?  Hey, we could do that on our show if you'd like.  You want to do paraplegic posing?  Like lingerie?  Centerfolds?  Centerfold show thing?  Why not?  How will you know if they're really paraplegic, though?  You have to take a bite out of their thigh and if they scream, they're out. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, my God.  Well, you know, there's always something new and interesting and exciting that we could do.  All right, Kimmy, come in and see us soon, all right?  All right, I'll see you guys soon.  All right, there she goes.  Bye.  Kimmy from Survivor Fame.  Ciao, baby.  Yo, no, and you hit that, dude?  No, no, no.  But she was naked in front of me and it was really nice.  Yeah.  We've all seen her naked.  She's unbelievable.  She was completely naked.  She had whipped cream on her.  It sounds like we're bitching about Jerry's body.  Of course, she has a pretty nice body and stuff, but I'm telling you right now, Kimmy's  body is unbelievable compared to that. 
[01:09:30]  Well, dude, she had whipped cream all in every crevice and then she went into the bathroom  to clean off and Norton goes in there and actually took the paper towels, damn paper  towels, and started wiping out of every nook and cranny of her body.  She was bending over and I'm squatting behind her three inches in front of my face.  She was so happy.  Right there, ground zero.  It was nice.  All right, we have to take a break.  Anthony, after the break, we're coming back with Clutch.  We're so excited today.  They're going to jam a couple songs for us.  We've been digging that one song, Careful With That, Mike. 
[01:10:00]  You know, the ha, ha, ha, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're here to hang with us today, so we'll talk to them in just a few.  You guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a Vaudeville show on acid.  Opie Anthony.  The Cruel Circus, Ron and Fez, middays, noon to 3, 1027, WNEW.  Anthony, Hotwire.  Hotwire.

[01:11:30]  Jim Norton in the studio, old Dirty floating around here.  And Clutch has made their way into the studio, Anthony.  Yeah.  We are very psyched these guys are here.  I have a problem right off the bat, though, with Neil, the singer.  I can't imagine what it would be.  Dude, you dumped in our bathroom, man.  Who else smells that grass?  I blew the spot in your bathroom.  It's the crunch-free bathroom.  Because there's no vent or no windows. 
[01:12:00]  But you do have eyewash in there.  Thank God, yeah, for the emergency dump.  Here's audio of Neil taking a dump.  One of those.  One of those leaves your shirt looking like you rode through a mud puddle on your 10-speed.  I was walking out there.  I think that's the guy that's on the microphone that just walked in there after me. 
[01:12:30]  I walked in right after you.  I'm like, oh.  Yeah, we usually keep that a crunch-free bathroom because there's no ventilation.  We got to put the sign up because it's so funny.  The only people that will crunch in there is like guests of the show because no one else wants the abuse.  Well, I just want to leave you something to remember us by that.  Yeah, that's good.  That works.  I got to go to Steve.  He's been holding for a long time.  He's from Philly.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, O&A?  Hey.  Yeah, I'm just glad to hear you guys got a really good band like Clutch on the radio. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, they're playing Irving Plaza here in New York on Wednesday.  Yeah, I want to see him in Lancaster on August 6th, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with the Chameleon.  Right on.  So, you know, Stoked.  Heard you playing that first time when you put him on, was it careful with the mic?  Heard you playing it, I couldn't believe it.  I was like, yes, Clutch on the radio.  That's what I'm talking about.  Big fan for like five years.  Cool.  You got a question for them?  They're right here.  Neil, what are you talking about, man?  You're not.  In general?  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  Just whatever comes to mind.  It's great.  Whatever's entertaining.  Trying to figure out what to do.  Who are you talking about, Astropithecus and Cray?  Astropithecus, that's a kind of monkey.  Like Missing Link.  Uh-huh.  Cray's a computer.  Supercomputer, one of the first ones, I believe.  What are you talking about specifically?  Nothing.  Nothing.  It was just something, you know, a list of absurd rhymes to entertain my bandmates.  You know, didn't direct it towards anybody, and that's the God's honest. 
[01:14:00]  That's the truth.  Cool.  And oh yeah, John Paul, you're ridiculous on the drums.  Love it.  Thank you, sir.  Played drums myself.  All right, Steve.  Thanks, man.  Thanks.  They're going to play for us in a little bit here, so.  I'll be listening.  All right.  Cool.  You guys got together in high school 10 years ago?  Yeah.  This August, what is it, August 10th?  Yeah, it'll be 10 years since our first show.  You remember the first song you played for everyone?  I don't know.  Like in public?  I remember the first show, but I don't remember the first song.  You know what it was?  It would have been Arcadia.  Yeah, we have a song called Arcadia that was on one of our seven inches.  Right.  What was the first performance you guys did? 
[01:14:30]  As Clutch was in Fort Reno, Washington, D.C.  But was there, I mean, was it, I don't know.  I want to ask, was it a talent show?  I mean, you know, was it, you know what I mean?  What was it?  It was just an outdoor.  Free festival.  Free, yeah.  They have them every week in D.C.  Uh-huh.  Bunch of people laying around in the grass.  Jamming.  Yeah.  Feeling it.  Hanging.  Wait, this girl has a great question for Neil.  Leslie, what's up? 
[01:15:00]  Hi, I just want to ask Neil how I could get his attention on a show.  He was at his last show and I was trying to get his attention.  I don't know how to do it.  Take a dump in the bathroom.  No.  I want to get good attention, not bad attention.  Man, you should smell his dump, Leslie.  We all do.  I don't want to do that.  I just want to hang out with him after a show.  Neil, comment?  Oh, well.  How do I get your attention?  Flares.  Can do that? 
[01:15:30]  Throw something at him?  No, don't do that.  Are you a good-looking lady there, Leslie?  Yeah, I'm pretty good-looking.  Yeah?  I was just at your trade win show the other day.  It was a good show.  Did you have a good time there?  Yeah, I had a good time.  I had a real good time.  Were you trying to get backstage or anything?  Not really.  I didn't know who to ask.  I was just trying to look at you through that little window.  You guys playing that angle with the girls?  Is it easy for you guys?  Go ahead.  I'll play that angle.  I'm a married man.  Ah, there you go.  I knew there was something going on with Neil.  He's like, oh.  All right.  You want to know in a good way, Leslie?  Leslie? 
[01:16:00]  Yep.  Definitely.  Definitely a good way.  Are you going to the show on the first, Jim?  Hey, Leslie, are you a goer, though?  I'm going to try to go, yeah.  No, are you a goer?  Oh, am I a goer?  Yeah, absolutely.  You'll go the distance, right?  Absolutely.  There you go.  For Clutch, definitely.  Look at that.  Neil, does this bother you at all?  I mean, you're married, and now you've got the band.  It's happening, and these girls want you.  And I've been listening for a long time, too.  Does it bother me? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  It doesn't bother me.  He's a little nervous.  No?  It doesn't bother you, though?  No, I'm just shaking after the dog.  All right, well, I'll see you guys.  Yeah.  I'll see you guys at the show at Irving Plaza.  Yeah, that's Wednesday.  Yep.  All right, Leslie, thank you.  All right, take care.  Bye-bye.  All right, bye.  We've got Kristen from Philadelphia wants to say hi.  Kristen, what's going on?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  We're hanging with Clutch.  I can tell.  It's about time. 
[01:17:00]  God, I've been waiting to hear Clutch on the radio for so long.  A lot of girls like you guys, huh?  Get a lot of girls at the show?  More and more.  Yeah.  You know, five, ten years ago, it was just strictly a...  Bunch of dudes, right?  Like a frat party, basically.  Not anymore.  Like one of our roast shows.  What do you like about the band, Kristen?  Oh, good God.  I have to name one thing?  Oh, just, you know, in general.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, aside from the...  I mean, they look just like NSYNC.  Oh, man.  That has nothing to do with it. 
[01:17:30]  The fact that it takes intelligence to be able to enjoy Clutch songs.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, look at that.  Look at that.  Do you guys ever visit the Pro Rock board?  Say that again, Kristen.  I'm sorry.  I was asking the band.  Do you guys ever visit the Pro Rock board?  Occasionally.  Occasionally?  Sometimes it's a little disturbing.  There's a lot of nutheads on that message board that like to lie, but it's flattering.  They're going to lie about us.  I mean, they could not be lying at all.  What's the biggest lie you've read about you? 
[01:18:00]  He's laughing.  He doesn't want to say.  You want to feel that?  Oh, really?  That bad?  Actually, they really don't lie about us for some reason.  I wish they would.  You don't think they lie?  About us personally?  No, about themselves, yeah.  You and the message board.  What, you actually feel bad about stuff you read on message boards?  No, not at all.  No?  Never.  Okay.  Okay.  Like, because that's just kind of comes with the territory now, you know? 
[01:18:30]  You got to take it with a grain of salt.  Yeah.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I've been diehard Clutch fans since like 95.  Dude, I want to say thank God for getting them on the radio.  Cool.  I'm going to the Irving Plaza show.  I went to Tradewinds a couple days ago.  I just want to say, Neil, you guys, man.  I remember seeing Marilyn Manson.  You guys opening up for Marilyn Manson.  And then I left him, started going with you guys.  You guys are great.  Right on.  Any way I can get to meet you guys on Wednesday?  Yeah, sure.  Just got a bus, too? 
[01:19:00]  No, you can just strangle Leslie when she's done.  I'll push her aside and take the wheel.  All right, Ed.  Hold on, all right?  Oh, beauty.  All right, cool.  Thanks, man.  Well, you guys want to rock or what?  Yeah.  Hell, yeah.  They are set up outside the studio, and it's going to get nice and loud, ain't it?  Cool.  All right, let's head outside.  Go ahead, Ed.  Yeah, why not?  We're going to take their positions.  And we'll rock.  Well, a lot of people out there now. 
[01:19:30]  It's like 30, 40 people outside of the studio.  Hanging.  Waiting for a clutch.  Can they start quick?  Is it one of those bands that can pop on, or they got to...  I think they're all set, ready to go.  Hey, guys.  Neil.  This is going to be loud.  Oh, all right.  Well, just tell them to go when they're ready.  Hello?  It'll be loud. 
[01:20:00]  Hey.  So we, uh...  Neil, whenever you're ready.  Well, whenever we're ready, huh?  Yeah, this is clutch, man.  Check them out.  You guys ready?  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

Someone on the floor down below  Checking in  Diane  Diane, you should have came up  Yeah  Imagine what that sounds like though  On the 8th floor  What the hell is going on?

Clutch jamming on the AM dial  Like the old days  My lord 
[01:31:00]  Remember the old days of AM radio?  Come on  Music radio  All right  Anthony  I guess we just got to tell everyone  We're not excited about the announcement we're about to make  But we have our 10 finalists in the Man Boop contest  Yeah  Up for your viewing pleasure  I was just told that our finalists were up  So usually we have a contest that involves a website  I go right away  So I clicked  I'm checking  And then once I got there  I'm like  Oh, why did I bother?  This is the worst contest we've ever done 
[01:31:30]  The worst  You're right  It's all the finalists  How many are there?  Uh, we got  We narrowed it down to 10  10 finalists  Ooh  Go to opieandanthony.com  And, um  It's just disgusting  From the top of the page  Scroll down to the bottom  I didn't even  Usually I vote right away too  When we have like the  Hot chick ass contest or something  Yeah  I scroll right to the bottom  I'm like  Oh, here's my favorite  Let me vote  Now, I didn't even vote  Because you know something?  I don't care  And I was like 
[01:32:00]  Ooh, ooh  Who should we vote for?  Should I vote for Ralph  With the Asian woman boobs?  Maybe George  With the one nice breast  Thought I'd get my vote  Or maybe I'll go all out  And get Lil Stevie  And his tumor  And I'll vote for that  What about the guy  That's holding his  His full D  And he's cupping it  Yeah, cupping it  Mmm  The sexy pose  Or who could forget  Ass man  Squeezing his into a cleavage  With his biceps  Norton's over there  With a lump in his underwear  You're turning him on  What about 
[01:32:30]  I'm just thinking about  Stevie  Old pudding head  What about the guy  His chest looks like a W  Man  He's got pointy ones  Norton just took  Hotel lotion  Out of his front pocket  Well, if you're not  Going to spit on it  For me  Like you usually do  Hotel lotion  Oh, God  Jim  And then you got  King Kong Bundy  With his  With his D's  Whatever  That guy was at  Bar 9  Rolling  Hat  King Kong Bundy  Yeah, yeah  He showed up 
[01:33:00]  That night  King Kong Bundy showed up  At Bar 9  Like it wasn't hot  Sweaty  And stinky enough  In that place  It was like a battle royale  We just started  We're all just sitting there  Looking at each other  Sweating  King Kong Bundy  Staple's double team  Walks in to suck up  Even more oxygen  What a mess  Oh, my God  He was sweating  Now, I was like  I hope there's no mosh pit  Tonight  Because this guy's  Going to flatten me  I guess, Opie  What the people do  Is go to  OpieAndAnthony.com  And you get to vote  For your favorite 
[01:33:30]  Know what you should  Really do, though  I mean, there's some  Pathetic guys up here  Yeah  In the finals  You got to vote  For the guy that would  Benefit most  From having this procedure  We have a doctor  Dr. Pistone  Who will make one of  These guys look  Completely normal  Yeah  Who's going to  Benefit most?  Well, then I was  Confused because I was  Voting on the guy  Whose breasts  I felt were the most  Attractive  Oh, really?  I don't know  I was like  Which guy deserves  To have them removed  Because they're so horrible  Now, is it  See, someone like Pat  If you voted for Pat 
[01:34:00]  He would get rid of  His man boobs  But then  It's King Kong Bundy  Yeah  But then what?  Then what is he left with?  It would almost seem  More freakish  To not have the huge boobs  And still have that big guy  Look at Marvin  Marvin's got banana boobs, man  Marvin?  Hold on  Who's Marvin?  Marvin's got like  The little ones  Oh, yeah  Fly out to the sides for  Look at Marvin  Vote for Marvin  Vote for Marvin  He's cupping them  You're right  He's cupping them  They're all hairy 
[01:34:30]  Somebody let the air out  He gets the operation done  All he's got to do is jog  And he's finished  Yeah  But someone like Pat  Or the ass man  Wouldn't they just look bizarre  Not having them?  Well, you would think  Look at ass man  Look at this mess  What is a picture of his ass doing in there?  What is that thrown in?  I guess because he's ass man  He wanted to maybe trick people  Into thinking those were his man boobs  Wow  Get rid of those  And then you got someone like  George who has the one boob 
[01:35:00]  Yeah  Poor George  George  It was a normal looking guy  A normal looking body  And then he's got that one  Boob  One freakish deformity  A freakish  This is kind of fun to look at after all  Womanly boob  Yeah  That's like  That's a small B right there  So do you  Do you vote for him  So he can get that taken care of  And then lead his life  As a normal human being  Or do you go to someone like  Lil Stevie  Who would have the boobs removed 
[01:35:30]  And then  He'd be left with  He'd be left with huge  Giant nips  Look at them  Dude  Look at Lil Stevie  Pop up Lil Stevie  Ben  For Opie  Is Lil Stevie still in the contest though?  Oh he is  Oh yeah  Now if you  If you take care of those  Do you know what that's going to look like?  Do you know what that's going to look like?

That's it  Yeah, but how long?  Two years  We get to bomb that abomination country of yours 
[02:01:30]  For two more years  Okay, let's not get into it  Don't legitimize it by calling it a country  Yeah  Is that Jay Moore?  What's up?  That little dirt heap  That you people keep running away from  To come here  You defend it  That's okay  You got such pride  I'm on welfare  And George Bush gave me a tax break  You're Puerto Rican  And you're on welfare?  This is a radio first  $350 is coming in my pot  With my neighbor's mailbox  Give Old Dirty a microphone  Because Ann was saying 
[02:02:00]  You guys were telling Ann  All those scams you're up to  Oh, yeah  According to Old D  I do crackhead stuff  Yeah  Angry Angel does crackhead scams  And Old Dirty does these  Little, like, business ventures  Yeah, he does high-tech stuff  You see  Remember when we had the gas problem, guys?  Yeah  When the price was, like, going for $3?  Yeah  I used to go around with my boys  And we used to suck the gas  Out of your white boys' cars  And we used to sell them  See, he would siphon out 
[02:02:30]  Gallons and gallons of gas  And then you'd go around  The way and sell the gas  We used to knock on the doors  And say, hey, you want to buy  Just don't let it gas?  Knock on the door  Crackhead  How much we want to buy?  And now, OD, that's crackhead, right?  Yeah, that's a crackhead scam  I understand  With the bad crack teeth  With the gasoline spilling over them  I could totally see why  That would be a crackhead scam  Why?  That's a crackhead scam  You sell it back to the same dude  You took it from?  How much money can you make doing that? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah  Angry Angel  Well, you figure  A dollar a gallon, right?  No, it goes like $2.50 a gallon  And I used to fill up like 5 gallons  You used to give me  Hit me over $10  That's a crackhead scam  Crackhead  I used to pay for $40  And then he was talking about  Another crackhead scam  Where you go to the newspaper machines  Early in the morning  When they're full  You put in your quarter  You take all the papers  And then you sell them  On the side of the road  In the traffic jam  That was my scheme  Yeah, and that's not more crackhead 
[02:03:30]  How many quarters  Are you going to get?  You know what I'm saying?  And then you need  Your initial investment  Of $25  To open the machine  You know what I'm saying?  So you know  You have to quote on every paper  Anyway  Puerto Rican Gordon Gekko  You're risking, dude  Gasoline in your mouth  For $10  You could drink out of a mule  For $20  Who's that?  Norton?  Norton  Norton  It's Norton  Now, Old Dirty  Give us an example  Of something a little more  Upper echelon  Alright, man  So, like, let's say 
[02:04:00]  This is like on the law  Of wrong of my ladder  Right  So let's say you're in a little  Not desperation  But you need a little quick cash  But you don't want to pull  A total crackhead  Nah, you don't want to do  You know  So you just go do hubcaps  Hubcaps  Yeah  So you steal some hubcaps  And then what?  Then you go  Wait for the sun  To come up  Wait for the place to open  And you go sell your caps  Oh, at the wrecking joints  Yeah, at the hubcaps  Police  That's too high class for me  I used to go into  I go to the stores 
[02:04:30]  With a pair of scissors  And the closer you want  Just make a little incision  And go to the register  Hey, I need a discount  Because this has holes  So he cuts the shirt  And then goes to there  And goes, give me a discount  Because it's damaged goods  How about  Hey, remember the competition  I told you about the meters?  What?  Remember what you used to say  That we used to take the meters with us?  Yeah, he would  Cut off the tops of the parking meters  Which now that entails some work  And you're going to get some pain  Can I ask a question?  Let's pay more  These are two men  That live in the United States 
[02:05:00]  Their entire life  And neither one of them  Can speak freaking English  I don't want to be in this country  You people got to suppress enough, man  Yeah, but you're taking that check  From us, aren't you?

Medicare, Batman  Hold on  This guy, Rob, has something  That the Mexicans are doing in California  Rob, what's up?  What's up, man?

[02:06:30]  And fill the thing up  With like 500 gallons of gas  Oh my God  Park it on the side of the road  And sell gas  To whoever wanted it  You know what I mean?  You can just think of what happened  If somebody would have matched in one  I would love to see one of those go up, man  Boom!  I don't know if they're still on it or not  The other thing they're doing  Is they use stolen credit cards  And they deal trucks  They go to a dealership  With a stolen card  Put a down on the truck  With a stolen card  Drive away  And then that's it  Really?  Yeah, because once  Once you put the down on it  And drive away  They think that you 
[02:07:00]  Pay for it  And you're going to keep making your payments  But it's nobody  Yeah, but white people do that, too  I mean, white people  Don't go hatchet parking meters  With a jigsaw  For 45 minutes straight  Because they're all  Hyped up on crack  That they bought  With government money  On the crack  The government money crack  Instead of government cheese  It's government crack  Angry angel  Now explain the parking meter thing  Yo, that was my scam  Yeah  Well, blowtorch

Because, like, you take out  The crime kit  And those first little drives  Start falling  And then you know it's over  Because you can make  All the noise you want, dude 
[02:08:30]  It absorbs the sound  Exactly  The city is ours  It makes  It's loud  So you can hack off  The tops of parking meters  Yeah, I should get a job  With logistics  And the NYPD  Want to give me a call, man  Word up  Yeah, they'll call you  You know what I'm saying?

[02:12:30]  So you put the tube sock in  They're throwing the change in  Yeah  But doesn't it not raise the gate if the money doesn't go through?  It is no gate  It's Jersey  No, like the unattended ones  I know that one of the exits on the parkway is the one from Bloomfield  And there's a McDonald's rest area right there  And you just  And if you don't  There's no one there  So you just drive in  And if you don't have money  You're supposed to take an envelope and mail it to you  Mail them a quarter  Yeah  It's like the honor system  All right, Mike  Thanks  Vinny the racist wants in 
[02:13:00]  Vinny the racist  Vinny!  You know  This jack-off, angry Abe, or whatever his name is  Anglifies everything I've ever called a show about  You know what I'm talking about  Angry Angel?  You don't like Angry Angel, Vinny?  No, come on  Anthony  This kid, you know  They come over here  And they  You know  Instead of working  They want to try to scam  This is how they get by  By scamming people  I mean, they're proud of themselves  He should be ashamed of  He makes his people look bad  Because he should be ashamed of himself 
[02:13:30]  Aw, poor baby  Your wife's got to get him  Banned by PR, right?  Excuse me  Excuse me?  Geek  Angel's talking to you, sir  Yeah, you're on the line with Angel, Vinny  Yeah, I can't remember him  What'd he say?  Called you a geek  Yeah  Would you like to say something  Directly to Angry Angel, Vinny?  I think I just did  All right, thank you  Not as, Vinny, not as angry or as racist  Yo, it's not the fact that when we get over here 
[02:14:00]  We already are starting to establish a crime syndicate  It ain't like that  No?  You know what I'm saying?  We do this in between work  Oh, okay  You know, if there's an opportunity  You gotta go  In between work, get it  Yeah  When was the last time you had a job, Old Dirty?  Yo, I'm an independent contractor  Yeah, we know  We know that  Sometimes there's a 10-year delay  Right  You know, it's gonna take a couple years, right?  No, I tell him  You haven't had a job in at least a year at this point  Yeah, it's been a year, dude  O.D., what's one of the clothing store scams? 
[02:14:30]  Um, well, not really clothing  Just boosting clothes from, from, um  Like you'd get a guy on the inside that works at, uh, one of the clothing stores  Oh, let me tell you, dude  We used to bring out duffel bags from a major department store  I'm not even gonna say that  And then what's the hardware store scam, too?  Where they go in and you'd have the guy make the key?  Oh, son  We got old mom and pop store out on the island, right?  Right  Roll up  Give him, like, four or five keys to make  Yo, pops, here, start making these keys 
[02:15:00]  Once the line  He's cutting keys  We're just boosting cases out the front  Cause you know how they concentrate on the key?  You really gotta watch it  And make sure every nook and cranny's being taken out  So they're watching that  And meanwhile, they're loading stuff out the door  While the guy, the poor old guy's making his keys  Holy ass  He's getting those good tools from Long Island, dude  Oh, my God  Yo, I'm not proud of that  I ain't proud of that  I'm not proud of that 
[02:15:30]  Boy, he found a conscience  The same thing with the clothing stores  They'd get a guy that works on the inside  And just unload clothes out the back door  On the loading dock  I mean, the easiest one was putting them in the garbage  Used to put, like, four or five hundred dollars worth of boots  Clothing in the garbage bags  Garbage day came  You had to stop the carting company  Yo, chill, that's all low right there  I worked at a place that I pilfered from  I did, my place of employment  I won't say exactly where it is  But they had, I think the statute of limitations is about up to 
[02:16:00]  They had these long tubes  It was a machine shop atmosphere  They had these long tubes of pure silver  That they made contacts out of  For electronics  And they put it in these machines  And it would just cut these things into  These very measured out little pieces for contacts  And silver's very soft  They had the cage that they kept the silver locked up in  Big eight foot long lengths of rod  About quarter inch rod of pure silver 
[02:16:30]  So I noticed you could put your fingers through the cage  And pull the silver rods out of the box  It's like a rhesus monkey  He figured out how to get the peach out from the mayonnaise jar  Get the ants out of the ant hole with the little thing  Yeah, that's how it was  And the trouble is  How do you walk out of there with an eight foot rod of silver?  Silver, very malleable, very soft  You could wind it around your legs  Around your midsection, around your arms 
[02:17:00]  Where'd you sell it?  I'd walk out of there like weighing a lot  There was a place that said we buy all silver and gold  Any of those places  They check out the purity of it  And then they weigh it and give you money  How much for an eight foot rod?  Oh, it was pure, pure silver  Did they say eight foot rod?  Where did you get the silver spring?  Yeah, I know  They never asked questions  But it had to be pure because it was for contact  Right  How much money would you say you got per rod?  Per rod?  Probably at the time it was something like 80 bucks 
[02:17:30]  80 bucks a rod  80 bucks a rod  Which was a great score back in, you know, the 80s  Yo, Anthony  Yeah  Yo, what's up?  You know, the guy who hires over there?

He goes, look  We go over to Home Depot  I said, okay  What do you do over there?  He goes, no  We go shop  And we grab a little something  Here we go  Here a faucet or something  And we bring it right  To the return desk  They bring it right 
[02:19:30]  To the return desk  Home Depot  They ask no questions  They get in the cash  They're in it  Oh, the old  Home Depot scam  Home Depot is slowing up  It's probably just  It's slowing up  I used to have a little bit  Of scam myself  I used to own a car stereo inflation  And every single time  I would install  A real hot stereo  I'd make a copy of the key  And I'd have the guy's address on file  So I'd wait  I'd wait three or four months  And it was repeat business  For me  It was great  So I used to go  I used to pay a guy  Have him hop the system out  I used to resell that system
