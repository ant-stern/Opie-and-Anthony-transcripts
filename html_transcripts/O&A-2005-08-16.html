<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Jim Norton, engaging in their usual vulgar banter, insulting both their staff and listeners.  A listener, "Dugout Doug" from whackbag.com, called in to describe the elaborate prank war waged by the show's "pests" (listeners) against rival radio host Jim Phillips, culminating in a billboard proclaiming "Mr. Phillips, You Lose. Good Day, Sir." Doug detailed the coordinated phone attacks and rapid fundraising efforts behind the billboard, and also discussed other planned pranks targeting Russ Martin, including tandem phone calls and commercials. He mentioned the various online forums debating the pests' actions.

The conversation then veered to Opie's frustrating attempts to eradicate a mouse infestation, resulting in several self-inflicted injuries from his mousetrap endeavors.  Jim Norton followed with a tale of his regrettable burgundy dining room paint job and a disastrous acting class performance involving diaper shopping.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the documentary "Grizzly Man,"  listeners' speculation on the filmmaker's death, and a news report about penguins staying at a luxury New York hotel, prompting further sarcastic commentary from the hosts.

The next segment touched upon a missed opportunity to interview penguins, followed by a discussion of Opie's celebrity sightings (Sean Lennon and Yoko Ono, Keanu Reeves, and a miserable-looking Regis Philbin), and listener protocol regarding approaching the hosts in public.  The "Golden Ticket" contest played several audio submissions from aspiring radio personalities; these ranged from humorous bits to lengthy, self-deprecating monologues, including one with homoerotic overtones and another detailing a bizarre on-air incident involving Icy Hot and genitals. The segment also included discussion of Howard Stern's alleged dishonesty regarding SiriusXM subscriber numbers. Studio guests Dick Cavett and Mark Maron were present, and an on-air argument between Opie and a staff member occurred.

Dick Cavettâ€™s in-studio interview, promoting his "The Dick Cavett Show: Rock Icons" DVD set, followed.  Technical difficulties and a bathroom break for Cavett fueled further vulgar banter.  The interview itself covered Cavett's career, including anecdotes about Janis Joplin, David Bowie, George Harrison, Groucho Marx (including attending his funeral), Woody Allen, and others.  He discussed his early career struggles, his views on modern television and comedy, an interview where a guest died on-air, his interactions with John Lennon and Yoko Ono (including a controversial song), modern news media, his battles with depression, the authenticity of celebrity autographs, and encounters with figures like Walter Winchell and Mark Gastineau.

The show continued with further discussion of Cavett's appearance, with listeners expressing mixed reactions.  This transitioned into a conversation with comedian and radio host Mark Baron, who discussed his father's manic depression, anxieties about Scientology, and performed a stand-up bit about cell phone dependence.  He shared anecdotes from the Comedy Cellar and Air America. A scheduled interview with Supercross rider Tyler Evans was cut short due to his lateness.  The remainder of this segment was a lengthy discussion with Baron on political commentary, encompassing left vs. right media, political correctness in comedy, the Iraq War, racial profiling, and the ACLU's role.  A technical issue abruptly ended the segment.

The final segment discussed political divides, including a crudely humorous aside about sex regardless of political affiliation.  The hosts announced their broadcast times (XM and 1190 AM in Manhattan), upcoming guests (Michael McKean, Bob Balaban, and Cindy Sheehan), and internship opportunities (with a joke referencing oral sex).  Mark Maron was thanked for his co-hosting, and Dick Habit and his DVDs (with a comment about a particularly uncomfortable Sly Stone DVD) were mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelcher.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable ass.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  You rock.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  You better get your head and your ass wired together,  or I will take your giant shit out.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  You said, I can smell your cunt.  ONA Party Rock! 
[00:05:00]  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  Don't break.  No fucking way, no fucking way.  No fucking way, no fucking way.  Hello, folk faith.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  What's up, y'all?  Hi.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:05:30]  Ew, I got some on me.  I think we should go right to the phone.  One of the head pests is checking in.  His name, dugout Doug from whackbag.com.  Doug, the radio show is yours, sir.  There's a billboard in Orlando with your name on it.  Yeah, I saw a picture of it.  I haven't seen the picture yet, man.  That's great.  The computer to my left is all screwy, and Eric doesn't have the picture up here yet. 
[00:06:00]  I emailed it to you.  It should be in your email.  I don't know if you went to it yesterday.  Wow, that's pretty crazy.  I'm actually, my breath was taken away yesterday at about 1 o'clock when I got the email.  Now, so we decided to call Jim Phillips yesterday.  Hold on, hold on.  Way before you get to Jim Phillips, you got to walk through, walk everyone through this, man.  Exactly.  We got a lot of new listeners since we attacked this stupid-ass Jim Phillips down in O-Town. 
[00:06:30]  O-Town.  O-Town claiming we don't have many listeners on XM Satellite Radio,  so the pests took it upon themselves to prove Mr. Phillips wrong by pretty much taking over his show for three or four days.  Yeah, that would be seven.  Seven days?  Seven straight days.  Where he threatened lawsuits.  Oh, he was freaking out.  He couldn't take phone calls.  Making all sorts of claims that Eric Logan was just an actor,  and it wasn't really Eric Logan that calls our show,  who, of course, is the head of programming for XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, unfortunately, that is Elo.  And then he cried behind the scenes, like most of these radio guys do, to his boss,  and then the bosses got involved with our bosses,  and we said, look, we can't tell the pests to stop.  Yeah.  That was our exact quote.  We can't tell these guys to stop at this point.  He could have his lawyers tell the XM lawyers not to play his audio, things like that,  but they can't stop the pests.  They're just fans.  Right, so then Whack Bag and the rest of the pests from other message boards and elsewhere, 
[00:07:30]  they decided, oh, they weren't going to let this one go.  So what did you guys do?  You got a collection together?  Apparently, during those seven days, I saw that as a perfect opportunity for me to whore myself all over your show.  Yeah.  And in one of those calls, a guy named Dirty Haiku had emailed me over the weekend talking about a billboard.  And in one of my calls into you guys talking about what we've been doing to Mr. Phillips and cunt, 
[00:08:00]  we decided to go ahead and laugh off a few crazy ideas that I thought I had gotten emailed to me,  like they wanted to take over the whole server for the radio station.  Some guy wanted to get a billboard in Orlando.  Well, enter Chucky, who called yesterday, who apparently thought this was a fantastic idea. 
[00:08:30]  Chucky jumps in there.  He throws a collection, opens up a PayPal account, throws up a collection thread on Whack Bag.  They get the grand for the billboard in, I think, three or four days.  Someone designs it.  This thing's up in two weeks.  That's beautiful.  It was absolutely beautiful.  You know, you guys are making marketing look absolutely ridiculous today, right?  Well, of course I sent an email. 
[00:09:00]  Did you hear how easy that was, Anthony, to get a billboard up?  Oh, I know.  And how cheap it was, relatively speaking?  Sure.  Isn't it amazing that our pests, our listeners, are now doing the marketing for this show?  Yeah, billboard.  Someone in Washington should be very embarrassed today.  I've seen the photo.  Did you see it?  Oh, yeah.  It's fantastic.  So continue, Doug.  I just want to make sure everyone understood what just, you know, transpired there in our conversation.  Yeah, honestly, it really wasn't all that difficult.  I wasn't even involved in it. 
[00:09:30]  Chucky threw the whole thing together himself.  But yesterday when I had emailed the picture to all you guys there, I also copied Eric Logan and threw a little P.S. on the bottom that, you know, this is what marketing is.  Just to let you know.  And he was the first one to reply back, and he was very impressed with what we had done.  Yeah, Elo gets back to the pests.  He enjoys the pests.  Yes.  I'll tell you, though, I got the email yesterday about the billboard and that it was up and that they were going to try to inform Mr. Phillips on his show. 
[00:10:00]  And so I tune in online to listen in, and I got to tell you, it is so completely unlistenable, I couldn't hang in there for any length of time.  They were discussing his trip on the train, that he had taken the train or something.  And that whole next, oh, that rancid meat nest was just as annoying as ever. 
[00:10:30]  What is it, Moira?  I don't know.  At least she's got a sexy name, though.  Oh!  How do you sit there and go, yeah, I'm going to fuck you, Moira.  Moira!  I think we got done with Jim Phillips about two weeks ago.  So it was really great to see how much we can get into a show's head and stay there.  Yeah.  I counted it yesterday. 
[00:11:00]  He is still at a 60-second delay.  60 now, huh?  There is Boston Strangler and myself, we were demoing a new type of call to these shows yesterday.  It's called the Tandem Attack.  Yeah.  It's when he called me on three-way and then got on hold.  He was going to proceed with a regular call, which is exactly what we did.  And in the background, I just whisper, I'm going to suck your cock. 
[00:11:30]  So they're focusing on his call, hopefully, while I'm getting the word cock out over the air.  That's brilliant.  Unfortunately, he did mention the word billboard, and they dumped out on the entire call.  Oh, I like the idea of a tandem call.  It's a clever ruse.  What's great is Mr. Phillips thought you guys were done with him, and then he has to wake up this morning and see this billboard. 
[00:12:00]  What does this billboard say?  Wow.  Way to go, Doug.  I might be able to go from memory.  It said, I think, Mr. Phillips.  Yeah, you lose.  Good day, sir.  Good day, sir.  Good day, sir.  Good day, sir.  The Opie and Anthony Army commemorating the Pat Battle of O-Town.  It's black with yellow letters, right?  Oh, yeah.  It just stands out. 
[00:12:30]  Obnoxious.  And how close is it to the radio station?  I believe it was a few miles away.  There's a map on Wack Bag showing where the billboard is as far as the station is concerned.  Yeah.  There's a lot of debate on whether or not he's actually ever going to drive by it.  Oh, yeah, he will.  I can tell you right now, my second call to him that got dumped out on, all I had to do was mention the word billboard.  Yeah.  He knows all about it, I'm sure.  And I bet you his colleagues are all coming into work laughing at him behind his back. 
[00:13:00]  So there is absolutely no way this guy doesn't know that it's there.  Doug has a lot of haters on Instant Feedback, by the way.  Why?  I don't know.  Whenever Doug starts talking, the haters come in.  That must be my friends from opianthony.net.  I don't know, but there are some haters.  They say, enough of this loser with a bunch of Zs next to it.  In case you guys didn't know.  That's what's great about this radio show.  We have whackbag.com that are fans of the radio show.  We have opianthony.net.  They are fans of the radio show. 
[00:13:30]  But whackbag and opianthony.net don't get along with each other.  How does that work?  It's like Iraq trying to get the Constitution together between the Sunnis and...  Isn't this a common cause, though?  It's like the Marine Corps and the Army.  There are different factions.  Actually, no, it's not even that far.  The different factions of the opianthony fan base, whackbag is where you're getting all  of your pests, apparently.  Because the other factions, like .net or post-horrors even, they hate the idea of pests and the 
[00:14:00]  Army.  I just found that out recently about a week or so myself.  That is so weird.  That's hysterical.  Oh, here's the billboard.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  That's great.  That is great.  Is this picture up on opianthony.com yet?  I think it might be.  Yeah, I believe Steve put it on Foundry.  So I don't know if he linked it yesterday.  All right.  It's a good one.  For the rest of the fans across America, go to opianthony.com.  The listeners got this billboard together on their own. 
[00:14:30]  We had nothing to do with this.  And the picture's up on opianthony.com.  That's classic.  Oh, there's that word again.  Classic.  All right, what are you guys working on next there, Doug?  We're still putting together a lot of things for Secret Mission 1 and 2.  Oh, very good.  We're developing sleeper cells for the secret mission you handed me up in the studio that  day.  All right.  We're developing sleeper cells in Philly, D.C., and Boston, and New York City.  These cells will be activated when we want to do these attacks that you were specifying 
[00:15:00]  the big attacks.  Well, they got Secret Missions and, you know, messing with O-Town and Jim Phillips, that's  all cute.  That's just the pest practicing for the big war.  Well, basically the billboard and we got something coming for Russ Martin, too.  You guys should hear within a week or two.  Okay.  It's not a billboard.  He's another douche in Dallas.  It's just something else.  We're demoing for the larger fish that needs to be fried in a couple months here. 
[00:15:30]  So we're testing out the ability to get some of this stuff running and how long it takes  to actually get on.  You know, like a billboard takes a couple weeks and now we know.  We're actually doing a 30-second commercial doing Russ Martin's show because he wouldn't  put any of us on.  So we're going to do a 30-second commercial during his show, just dropping all the clever  little Connor references. 
[00:16:00]  We're going to drop them all in about 30 seconds during an ad just so we get it on his show  no matter what.  That's hysterical.  The guys are out of their minds.  The guy had no balls anyway.  That's a couple hundred dollars because, you know, it's just one market.  Well, next time you guys set up a PayPal account, let us know so we can throw some money to  the cause.  And we also have, as you all know, the secret website.  Our friend Sniper, who has developed that website, has also developed a secret, secret website. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, this goes so many levels deep, I don't even know where it ends anymore.  I really don't.  I don't even know where to go to join the O&A Army.  I don't even want to know.  Just in case someone comes to me and says, look, we've got to put a stop to this.  I want to make sure I don't know nothing.  They're like the mole fans.  Like, you get, like, one level and then you go down and there's, like, another level of creeps.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To the left, there's more of them.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there's some very scary, scary individuals that we associate with here. 
[00:17:00]  Let's see.  Doug equals Ambien.  Please kill him now.  I'm interested in what Doug has.  This guy is really boring.  Fuck Doug.  He's an ass cunt.  Yeah, but you know what, though?  I love the fact that I could generate some kind of emotion in somebody.  Well, you certainly are.  Hey, I love it.  I love the attention.  You know what's next?  Some people are annoyed at you out there, but you've got four little tents in front of the pants in this room. 
[00:17:30]  We're big fans, Doug.  And that's all that matters.  Good boy.  All right, Doug.  Thanks, gentlemen.  Have a good day.  Thanks, man.  Thanks for the update.  There he goes.  Doug out.  Doug from whackbag.com.  The home of pests.  Right.  I guess.  Pests.  And we also like the gang at opianthony.net, wowfans.com.  Cringehumor.net.  Cringehumor.net.  Posttours.net.  Eatabullet.com.  Churchofopi.org.  That's just creepy.  What?  Churchofopi.org.  That guy is a scary individual. 
[00:18:00]  How cool is that?  The fans now buying billboards for us.  That's very, very cool.  They have bought the first one, and there's another one on the way, I guess.  And you know that there are people, other shows are going to think that we're behind  it, but I mean, we don't do, we try to do honest, you know, nonsense, and we really  aren't behind it.  It's hilarious, though.  They take it upon themselves.  They get obsessed with a certain thing, and they go, and take it to the limits.  It's beautiful.  It's beautiful. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  Wow.  That's how we start today's show.  Yes.  That really cracks me up.  And marketing down in Washington should be ashamed of themselves.  How hard is it to do something like that?  How should they feel?  Ashamed?  Oh.  I don't know.  They definitely should.  All right.  Wait, that would have been...  I know if I had it all queued up and ready to go.  Oh, there you go.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  My picture's that big, stupid hand pointing.  Jimmy goes, how should I feel in points, cartoon hand? 
[00:19:00]  And then I got a hundred buttons to choose from.  Obviously, it was the shame on you one you wanted.  Yeah.  All right.  How easy would it be to grab a few grand for XM?  To grab a few grand and go to some of the big markets and just put up billboards?  It would be real easy.  How easy?  Very.  It would be extremely easy.  Look how easy it was.  There's no month lead time or anything.  These guys put this together in no time.  And what's the problem?  By the way, the pest could take it to the next level now.  I think the media, maybe the websites like allaccess.com, fmqb.com, insideradio.com, rronline.com. 
[00:19:30]  You can get all these websites when you listen to the replay.  Get a pen ready.  I think they would like to know about the billboard you guys bought on your own.  And also maybe the local media in Orlando, radio trades would eat that shit up.  Of course they would.  They'd look and go, oh, what?  The fans have taken it apart.  Wow.  Let me write this down. 
[00:20:00]  See, our goal on this show is to have our fans, the pests, do everything for us.  Right.  When we have a really good show, when we do have a Bill Donahue on the show, or we recap  Sex for Sam 3, you guys alert the media for us and let them know what we're doing.  Makes it so much easier to do this radio program.  Our goal, put no work into the show.  Just have the pests do it.  Just sit down and let it all unfold in front of us. 
[00:20:30]  Yes.  But yeah, it would be very easy to get some billboards here and there.  And I think if we came up with some creative sayings and things that we could put on a billboard,  it would be even that much more effective, right?  All right.  But the picture of the billboard's up on opianthony.com.  There you have it.  Voila.  Right under a tree.  How lovely.  With the military stencil font that they use.  That is hilarious.  This is very good.  Hang that up in the studio somewhere, okay?  The Pat Battle of O'Town. 
[00:21:00]  Pat Battle gets on the sign.  Just when I thought the Pat Battle thing was dead.  All right.  That's great.  Bravo.  I was late for work today because I messed up all my fingers setting mouse traps.  They're back, huh?  They're back.  Ah.  They're back.  Are you leaving garbage out?  No, not at all.  That's the weird thing.  That's how I discovered the mice to begin with. 
[00:21:30]  I'm up to five.  Oh, my God, dude.  Five.  I've caught five so far.  I've caught four on my own without even using traps, and now I'm mousetrapping my ass off.  Mousetrapping my ass off!  That's great.  That's infested.  I know.  Yeah.  Well, I have a landlord that doesn't give a shit.  That's the problem.  Yeah.  I've got to finally buy something in New York City because I'm done.  You're also on the ground floor.  I'll make it harder, though.  The amount of rent I pay on this joint, it's a nice place, but, you know, it's got a mouse problem. 
[00:22:00]  You've got spaces under the door or anything?  It's a space between the counter and the refrigerator.  But where are they coming in?  I always see, you know, them climbing up or down that thing.  That's it.  Creepy.  I know.  It stinks.  But I've already caught five.  Do you have to put food up on there where the mouse has been?  I'm mousetrapping my ass off.  That's the new thing.  So I fucked up, like, three of my fingers this morning at, like, 4.45 in the morning. 
[00:22:30]  I'm sitting mousetrapping there.  Well, I'll explain.  I bought two mousetraps, and Friday night I set one with peanut butter.  Everyone says peanut butter does the trick.  Sure.  So a little dab of peanut butter on the mousetrap, slide it into a paper bag because you want to make cleanup all nice.  Oh, you put it in a paper bag.  Very clever.  A little trick that my brother taught me.  And sure enough, BAM!  That's clever.  Woke up Saturday morning to a dead mouse split in half, basically. 
[00:23:00]  Oh.  Oh, snapped its little, little neck.  Its little mousy neck.  And I just lift up the bag.  It's a little shopping bag.  And walk out of the apartment and goodbye.  Real easy.  Mm-hmm.  So then I set the second mousetrap, and what day are we up to?  Tuesday.  So from Saturday until today.  Mm-hmm.  It's been three days of setting this thing with peanut butter, checking in the bag every morning or later in the day, what have you.  And the fucking peanut butter is gone, and the mousetrap is not going. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, they're figuring out how to get around it.  Wow.  That's clever, little guys.  Well, I heard the mouse, and he was saying, hold that bag at a 45-degree angle.  So then, you know, it was so hot out.  Yeah.  Obviously, here in New York, it was up to close to 100 for a few days in a row there.  I'm thinking stupid me because my kitchen is kind of separate from the rest of the apartment in a way.  There's a door.  And so I don't AC that area. 
[00:24:00]  I just close the door.  So it gets really hot in there.  I'm assuming that it's so hot that possibly the peanut butter is melting stupid me because I'm like, why isn't this thing working?  And I studied a little further.  And I'm like, no, this mouse is eating the peanut butter without setting off the mousetrap.  Figured it out.  So this morning, I wake up all excited, like, all right, I think I've got it figured out.  There's going to be a dead mouse in there.  Sure enough, not a dead mouse, but the peanut butter is gone again.  I'm like, oh, my God.  So I'm looking at the thing, and I'm stupid me. 
[00:24:30]  I kind of just tap the mousetrap, like, what is wrong?  Come on!  It goes off like it's nothing.  It's barely tapping it.  Well, you can't put your finger in there.  Are you insane?  I wasn't testing the mousetrap, like, duh, let me push this down.  I just kind of touched it, like, what the heck is going on here?  And bam, that's all it took.  So I'm like, why isn't this, you know?  So then I ran out of peanut butter.  So now I'm like, this is 4.45 in the morning.  You know how you are if you wake up early.  4.45 in the morning, you're, like, barely awake. 
[00:25:00]  So I got the mousetrap on the counter, and I'm now trying to get a little pile of granola around it because I ran out of peanut butter.  And I'm carefully, you know, placing the granola around the mousetrap.  The thing goes off on its own, snaps my thumb.  How do you fasten granola onto a mousetrap?  No, I'm just piling it around it.  No, you need something that gets a little resistance.  Like, cheese is good because you can kind of slam it on there and anchor it a little bit.  I see what you're saying.  So that the mouse has to tug.  It's got to tug at it.  I see what you're saying. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  You can just pick the granola off.  You're sitting there with no shirt, and the mice probably looking, well, look, we caught a swimmer.  So it goes, so I'm trying to get the granola, a little pile of granola around the mousetrap,  and the thing, you know, goes off again.  Nails this fucking thumb, and the granola goes flying all over the kitchen.  I pick up the mousetrap 445 and slam it against the wall like, you son of a bitch.  And I set it a third time, and it went off. 
[00:26:00]  That didn't hit my finger, and then I finally got it all set and ready to go, so we'll see what happens.  That is probably one of the most nerve-wracking things you have to do is setting a mousetrap.  You freak out as you do it.  It's so fragile, the whole connection thing there.  You're like, I just don't fucking click on my fingers.  Yeah, my nerves, to begin with, suck.  So all of a sudden, I'm just setting them off.  So we'll see if the granola works today.  I know it's not.  I'm going to have to go get the peanut butter, but I've got to get this one.  You need a different type. 
[00:26:30]  They were gone for a while, but now there's, you know, I got one, and there's obviously a little friend.  And others have told me, well, if you see one, there's a lot more hanging around.  The best way to get rid of mice, and I've had to do this before, is when you go to sleep,  I took peanut butter and cheese and mixed them together,  and I piled them on my pillow right by my face.  And when I woke up and the mouse was nibbling right by my face,  I just looked him in the eyes and went, beat it.  That works, huh?  He scrammed.  Scram, you. 
[00:27:00]  So, and that's why I was a little late today, too,  because I was setting these mouse traps for like 15 minutes trying to get them set,  and my fingers are killing me.  You've got a serious mouse problem.  Well, I've got a serious landlord problem.  You've got to get out of there, eh?  That is what it is.  I've got to get the hell out of there.  It's time.  It's absolutely time.  Yeah, my place is starting to deconstruct itself.  I've got to get out of there, too.  Yeah?  Yeah, all of a sudden the condensation line on the air conditioning unit started leaking  right through the living room ceiling. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, you know what happens?  It gets very hot and humid, and if the line is clogged at all, it backs up,  and the water leaks into the attic, and in time it comes through the ceiling.  So now, in my living room, I have a big spackle tape.  You know how they tape the seams of the spackle on the ceiling?  Yeah, yeah.  It came down.  Oh, God.  So that's like hanging like a stalagmite in my living room with a towel underneath it,  and then I don't know where they're coming from, but moths. 
[00:28:00]  Moths.  They're flying around like crazy in my house.  They're just fluttering around?  Fluttering.  You're trying to watch TV?  Dropping their little moth doody all over the place.  Flutter.  Dude, you've got to...  Don't say that.  You have to get rid of every single piece of furniture.  I don't mind moth shit.  Moth doody is very toxic, and they're just fluttering around,  dropping their moth doody as you're trying to yawn.  Yawn. 
[00:28:30]  There's the word.  Stupid moths.  They're fluttering all over the place, and I don't know what to do about it.  I've got to move.  I've just got to throw away the place.  Throw it away.  Way to handle things.  I know.  There's a booger on the couch.  Get a new one.  There's a moth.  Find me a new place to live.  Shit, it's a moth.  It's not Mothra.  There's like ten of them, though, at any given time,  just fluttering around the house.  No matter how many kill, there's still ten.  Get a little butterfly in there.  Oh, run around. 
[00:29:00]  You could be in your tighty-whities running around catching little moths.  It'll give you something to do during the day.  That's a good idea.  You don't really do anything at the radio show.  That could be your little thing you do every day.  I'll do it every day.  Do that.  Jumping around with your butterfly net.  Got another one, honey.  Yeah.  Under shorts and work boots.  Let's let them go.  Then you could put them in a book and flatten them out.  Oh, maybe make a little display.  Yeah.  Jesus, we're the worst.  And I, I, it's, the place is coming apart. 
[00:29:30]  And then during the bad rains we had the other day,  it started leaking in the, in the kitchen.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, this is one of the seams in the ceiling again, leaking.  You do realize that we all, well, Jimmy's the only one so far,  we have to start living like we have money.  Like real humans.  Yeah.  I just don't get a place.  I just don't get it.  We now make money.  I want to get a place.  I haven't found one yet.  I got to find a place before you can buy it and move in.  Yeah.  There's a bunch of crap out there. 
[00:30:00]  Goddamn, they want you to buy a house.  Hey, this one's good.  1955 it was built.  What the fuck are you going to do with a 1950?  I don't care how it's remodeled or redone or anything.  It's still 1955.  Before you know it, it's good.  The ceiling's going to be leaking again.  Any skylights that are in there are after markets so those leak.  People want like outrageous amounts of money for pieces of shit.  Yeah.  Well, good luck, sir.  Good luck.  Then you got to hear about the housing bubble is going to burst and the prices of houses are going to go down. 
[00:30:30]  That'll happen right after I sign when I buy.  It'll just, that's it.  The prices will plummet.  Don't they go back up after that?  I've been hearing that too and it's like they say something like people say that for years.  Yeah, I know.  It's like this goes up and down, up and down.  It's like a little rollercoaster thing they do.  No one asked me how my place was.  Jimmy, how is your place?  Funny you should ask, Ant.  I'm a faggot and I had it painted yesterday.  I had my dining room painted and I had it painted burgundy and I fucking hate it. 
[00:31:00]  You picked the color.  Yeah.  And now it's on the wall and you hate it.  I'm just, I'm fucking so depressed today.  I just woke up like you incompetent ass.  Did you have the painter paint a little bit and then step back and look?  No.  Yeah, you should do that.  You should actually, before all that paint is mixed up, you get a little sample and they put it on the wall.  I did that.  Make a look and go, hmm.  But this person who's been doing it has made so many trips I felt bad.  I kind of figured that was the color I wanted anyway.  Like I kind of knew.  Burgundy for a kitchen? 
[00:31:30]  No, no, no.  For the dining room.  It's a small dining room with a lot of glass in it.  Does it turn out pink?  No, no.  It's not pinkish.  I didn't get too white.  I got it too dark.  It would have been pink if it was light.  Yeah, so it's real dark in there and you don't like it.  No.  Just go off white, beige, beige, beige, beige.  I beige in my living room.  Beige.  Beige.  I don't know what color it goes with.  It's got a flow.  Burgundy looks faggotty.  It looks purple.  I do.  I know.  Eric's got burgundy up on the screen.  Let me see.  It's on my left here.  And it looks faggotty.  No, no, no.  You should have went with, like, the red up there. 
[00:32:00]  You should have went with redwood.  No, it's, uh...  You are a faggot.  I'm not a faggot.  I just picked the wrong color.  I have a light blue bedroom, which is lovely for a boy.  A beige living room, which is fantastic.  And I figured this would flow on.  The Martha Stewart colors are the ones I got.  I will...  Oh, no.  So what?  I will never...  I will never paint a room.  I will never have a room painted.  No.  No.  Why not?  When you get a place, it's good enough. 
[00:32:30]  No, you gotta paint.  It's good enough.  Now...  What color does that look to you?  Oh!  That's blood red.  I know.  That's gonna be a pain in the ass to cover up with any other color now.  I'm so fucking depressed.  You're gonna have to prime the shit out of that.  You won't have to sand it, though, will you?  No, you just have to get an undercoat of, like, gray or something to put over that  before you can paint anything on top.  The room is gonna be smaller than so many coats of paint you're gonna put on that. 
[00:33:00]  Fucking...  I'm so annoyed at myself.  So is that why you didn't call me back yesterday?  I never got your message, to be honest with you.  You called me.  You said you called me.  I had an acting class, which I was...  I was...  Another thing I was just...  I stink.  How did you do?  Awful.  Really?  Awful.  Were there any good actors in the class?  One guy, this guy, uh, uh, Bill...  De Niro?  Yeah.  Bob.  This guy, Bill, he's like a young, good-looking, broad-shouldered boy.  Yeah?  He's a comedian.  Yeah, he's acting very good.  He annoys me, but he can really act.  And what did you have to do?  A scene, which was, uh... 
[00:33:30]  With Bill?  No, no, no, not Bill.  Hello, Bill?  Hello, Bill?  No, it was, uh...  It was me.  It was like a Mr. Mom-type scene, which is revolting, and it's nothing like I'm playing in Louis'  show.  But you gotta, you know, you still...  The scene wasn't that badly written where I can blame the material.  You're not learning how to act like a certain character.  You're just learning the craft.  Well, just, you know, it's just...  It's scene interaction.  It's just, you know...  Yeah.  It helps to do.  What do you have to do?  I played a guy, Nathan, and, um...  They had a reader.  A girl read the other guy's part, and that's pretty much the way it is on auditions, and  she was not...  She kind of read it stiff like the way the other guy would. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  And I just stand there, and I don't know how to talk.  It's like, when you're acting, you're fucking talking, but you're not talking naturally.  It's like I'm stiff.  And my hands are on my hips.  Like, what do I do with my hands when I talk?  It just...  And that's the hardest thing.  You do it every day, and it comes out very natural, how you talk.  But the second you try to act, all of a sudden, you're...  Yeah, you don't know what to do with your body, and your inflection in your voice gets  different.  And I talk like that?  I don't know why I talk like that.  Like, what are we supposed to be doing? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, my God.  You're shitting me.  You do that?  So, when I get nervous, or, um, you know...  Do the corners of your mouth stay really stiff, too?  Wait, you know...  I'm not sure what you're doing.  I'm just...  It's so stiff and uncomfortable.  When I'm good, I do a nice job, but when I'm awful...  You're just awful.  I'm laughable and terrible.  And I was so depressed when I walked...  Because she's like, this is a scene that I thought you would do really well in.  Oh, she did not.  She was good, though.  She was right.  She was right.  I mean, she trained Romano. 
[00:35:00]  I'm not saying he's the world's greatest actor, but he's good enough, and he's a Meisner actor,  and he does a great job on his show, so...  Oh, man.  Forty million a season.  Sign me up, lady.  Wow.  It's such a hard thing to do and come off natural.  Fucking...  I was so aggravated at myself.  It's so great to see, like, when they put sports people in TV shows.  They used to do that a lot in the 70s, when you'd have, like, a sports guy go on the Brady Bunch or something,  and their acting is just the worst.  Hey, how are you kids doing? 
[00:35:30]  It's really just bad.  But it's a hard thing to do.  George Foreman was better.  What was it?  Like, was it a Sidney Poitier movie?  Was he in with Cosby?  He did a better job than I did yesterday in class.  Oh, that sucks.  I was awful.  Oh, old Jimmy.  Oh, I was so disgusted.  Just driving to the cellar, I wanted to just bite my face.  What was one of your lines?  I'm not a big fan of the comfies.  I had a big problem with the comfies.  It was about two...  The comfies?  Diapers.  It was two guys diaper shopping.  Uh-huh.  And I can't play anything, like, I'm not...  Why would two guys be diaper shopping? 
[00:36:00]  Just two single dads or whatever.  Again, revolting conceptually.  What do you play well?  Anger, right?  Yeah, but that's easy, man.  Anger is easy.  Anyone can play anger, you know?  For Pete's sake, you know?  Oh.  What moron can't do that?  Good gravy.  Yeah, get a hold of yourself, Ted.  Yeah.  But I...  To me, that was a little bit...  I would have preferred to play this guy kind of like a douche.  Because that's to me funnier.  A douchebag shopping with his friends and doing this, quote-unquote, motherly or effeminate thing. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, but you can't always be angry or a douchebag, right?  Absolutely.  But now you're just playing a straight guy.  Yeah.  You go in there with your pal and you have to deliver your line and it's what?  A bunch of lines.  One of them was...  He goes, something about the comfies.  He asked about the diapers.  And I'm like, I'm not a big fan of the comfies.  I had a problem with the comfies.  We start talking about the diapers.  I'm not a big fan of the comfies.  I'm not a big fan of the comfies.  Really?  Seinfeld?  Put fucking hydrogen in his mouth?  Asshole?  I'm not a big fan of the comfies. 
[00:37:00]  Yay, the comfies!  Oh, I really should be executed.  That's awesome.  A red dining room and no acting skills.  Fucking...  Ugh.  You'll do fine.  How much primer am I going to need?  A lot.  You've got to cover the whole room.  Yeah.  Of course.  The answer is a lot.  Let's rewind a little bit.  Mike in Massachusetts.  Go ahead, Mike.  Hey, Anthony.  I was just wondering if...  When you have the moth problem,  if you're dancing around naked  with the cock between your legs,  and you're kind of...  If you're saying,  I'm crying, crying, crying. 
[00:37:30]  I'm crying.  I'm crying.  Yeah, boss.  All right.  That's very funny.  Yes, that's what I'm doing.  Pinching his nipples with dirty fingernails.  I mean, fuck me hard.  Fuck me?  Fuck me.  I would fuck me.  Hey, Don.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I own a pest control company.  Anthony, you probably have  Mediterranean meal moths  in your pantry in your kitchen.  No, no.  There's nothing in my pantry.  I've looked.  Okay, you've checked.  I've looked through all of my food products,  and I have none of those 
[00:38:00]  little things in there.  Are they real small arrow-shaped moths?  What shape?  Arrow.  Like arrow-shaped.  They're shaped like moths.  Are they big and fluffy?  No, they're not big and fluffy.  They're those thin little moths.  Then they're either  Mediterranean meal moths,  or with all your fancy clothing,  they might be  case-making clothes moths.  So you've got to dry-clean  all your clothes  and get rid of the eggs.  Aha, they're nesting in your shirt.  Look at this.  Eggs.  They're right there.  Moth egg whites.  You have to either brush it all off by hand 
[00:38:30]  or just simply get them dry-cleaned,  and then you have to, like,  lightly fumigate the house  to kill all the adults  to keep them from reinvesting.  People have this...  People just have got me completely wrong.  I, uh...  The moth thing,  it doesn't bother me on a germ level.  I'm not like,  ew, the germ...  I just...  They annoy the piss out of you.  You're trying to work on the computer,  and they're fluttering  in front of the light  on the screen.  That annoys me.  I smack them around.  I don't care.  How many are there?  I'm flinging it to the wall.  Dude, they're all over the place.  They're moths.  They're everywhere. 
[00:39:00]  What would you do  if there was a mouse in your house?  Uh, then I would just probably  get a hotel room  and leave.  You would really freak, huh?  I would abandon everything.  I think you would.  Moths.  So they don't really have you, uh...  Wrong.  No, no,  because that's disgusting.  It's not a germ thing.  Mice will piss and shit  on your countertops  and, uh...  where you prepare your food.  Oh, I found some mouse poop  on my counter.  Yeah, that...  Very, very tiny little pellets.  Can't be dealt with.  Microscopic.  Ugh.  It's there, though. 
[00:39:30]  And you don't see the piss  that was down and dried.  Yeesh.  Mice are more disgusting  than the wall.  I think people are amazed, uh,  to find out that you and I  are still renting.  I know.  We're just idiots.  I'm looking.  We're just idiots.  It takes a while.  But anyway,  getting back to Jimmy,  I called up Jimmy  because I needed a ruling  on something.  A celebrity ruling,  and you weren't there  to help out your pal.  What was the question?  Well, we went to see  a movie yesterday.  An artsy movie  called, uh, 
[00:40:00]  Grizzly Man.  Oh, two seconds.  It's, uh,  it's, uh,  helium,  not hydrogen, Jimmy.  That's what the listeners  are saying.  I didn't, uh,  hear what you said.  They're absolutely right.  Seinfeld on hydrogen.  Oh, get out of the way!  Seinfeld's exploded!  Oh, this is the worst  catastrophe I've ever seen!  And I knew,  by the way,  that I said it wrong.  I didn't know  what helium was  the right answer.  And actually,  hydrogen was more appropriate  because that's what I did.  I fucking imploded  in acting class.  Well, speaking of acting class,  Jay's, uh, 
[00:40:30]  on top of you  on this one.  I think less.  Go ahead, Jay.  I think little Jimmy's problem  started when he tried  to play a straight guy.  Oh.  That's very hurtful, sir.  I was a Mr. Mom  for Pete's sake.  But I needed a celebrity ruling.  We went and saw  Grizzly Man yesterday.  Grizzly Man.  That was the, uh,  the bear documentary, right?  Yeah, it's a strange movie.  I got some opinions on that  that I'll save for later  when other people see the movie.  But the guy obviously  was a kook,  and I'm thinking that  he, uh, purposely  had the grizzly bear eat him. 
[00:41:00]  Stop.  At the end of the movie.  Like he was suicidal,  and that's how he...  I mean, he just started  losing his freaking mind.  I'm going to kill you.  And he basically  was in the Alaskan, uh,  wilderness,  even though it was  like a national park,  so how...  I don't know.  And he was supposedly...  He was protecting the bears,  but they're already  relatively protected.  Of course they are.  In the national forest  and what have you.  And so he'd go there  every summer  to kind of film them  and study them,  and then he'd come back  to the States  and show his, uh, 
[00:41:30]  footage to, like,  classrooms and stuff,  and he started an organization,  you know,  a typical environmentalist.  And, uh,  after his 13th season,  he decides to stay  later than he usually does,  so the bears that are  relatively friendly  that he knew  were now hibernating,  and in their place  are the more surly bears.  Surly.  That bear is surly!  So the surly bears  come, uh,  come in and hang out  where the, uh,  the tamer bears  would usually be.  Mm-hmm.  And one of these surly bears  ends up eating him 
[00:42:00]  and his girlfriend.  Good.  I'm not giving anything away  that you go into the movie  knowing that.  Was his girlfriend hot?  They wouldn't, uh,  show the girlfriend.  He wouldn't show the girlfriend  because his whole thing  was that he was out  in the wilderness  by himself  pretty much living  among the bears.  Oh.  Was he trying to  bullshit people?  A little bit.  Like he was there alone?  Yeah, because he got footage,  you know,  some of the footage  he never showed anyone  where, like,  she's in the shot  and like,  oh, no, no,  people are supposed to  think I'm alone out here.  Ah.  Okay.  And he was alone  for, you know,  many of the summers  he did it, 
[00:42:30]  but then there was  a few occasions  where he brought,  you know,  this chick.  And one of the bears  ends up eating him  and her  and there's actual audio  of him being,  Did you hear it?  Eaten alive.  No, they won't, uh.  They won't, uh,  play that on the...  What's the use of  going to see that  with the best part  they cut out?  The, uh,  the voiceover guy,  the director of the film,  you see him  with the headphones on  listening to the attack  and he's like,  he's obviously  very emotional  and another girlfriend  that he had  is holding the recorder 
[00:43:00]  and pushing stop  and, and then  the guy hands back  the tape to the girl  and says,  You really should  just get rid of this.  You should never  listen to this.  Put it on the internet.  I guess she's never  heard it and, uh,  you know,  she should destroy it.  Right, and again,  they make a movie  and they leave out  the most interesting part.  Right.  Which is that asshole  being eaten by a bear.  And they pretty much  teased it that, uh,  you might hear the audio  and I'm thinking...  Oh, stop.  I'm going in my head,  uh, do I want to hear  audio of a guy  being eaten alive  by a bear or not? 
[00:43:30]  And my answer was,  Yes, I do.  I did want to hear that.  Ramone.  He was just taunting the bear.  Your website's hard  to navigate.  By the way,  on RottenTomatoes.com,  love the website.  It, uh,  does a great job  as far as reviewing  all these movies.  A 94% rating.  Most reviewers  around America  loving this movie.  How come they love it  when they cut the bear  eating part?  Because it's a documentary  and they look good  loving it.  Just like the Penguin movie.  Well, the guy was nuts.  The guy was absolutely nuts.  Supposedly he lost out  to Woody Harrelson 
[00:44:00]  as far as being on Cheers.  Stop.  That sent him down a road  where he started  drugging and drinking  and all that  and then finally  found happiness  living among the bears.  Did he take an acting class  before Cheers?  I guess he went out to L.A.  He went out to L.A.  and did a few things.  Hey, why is the bear  coming at me?  If the acting  doesn't work for Jimmy,  he's going to go  into the wilderness  and live among  the raccoons or something.  Not now.  They'll just find me  asleep somewhere  on 15th Street  some tranny  eating my guts out.  My video camera spilled.  My documentary spurled. 
[00:44:30]  Cast him in their  natural habitat.  You got a cigarette, Daddy?  Shh.  My opinion on this guy,  like he was coming back  with all this footage  and he was very passionate  about what he was doing  and I think when he came  back to the States,  he even made it  on Letterman once  so he was kind of a celebrity.  I think people were just like,  yeah, whatever.  They didn't really give a fuck  and had all this footage  and stuff and he was getting  more and more crazy  and into this thing  that I really believe 
[00:45:00]  that this guy set up  his own death  by Grizzly.  He says,  if I get eaten,  people are going to  look at my stuff,  look at my works.  Are you sure he's dead?  Oh, yeah, he's dead.  Oh, they had the coroner  describing a lot of stuff  and it was...  Oh, really?  What happened?  What did the bear do to him?  Well, he ate him alive  because he started  on his head.  Just gnawing  on his head.  And ripping his scalp apart  and then I guess  somehow the coroner  could figure out that.  Then the bear gave up  on the head  so he was still alive  and then grabbed his side 
[00:45:30]  and just started...  Oh.  He was eaten alive.  No doubt.  God, he deserves it.  What do you think  he's thinking?  It was a white...  What the heck was it?  A white grizzly or...  A white...  Someone help me out.  It must be a white grizzly.  Now, how come  the girlfriend got eaten too?  She was there  taking a frying pan  and slamming it  over the bear's head  over and over again  trying to save her boyfriend.  Wow.  And he's supposedly 
[00:46:00]  heard on this tape  which you don't get to hear  yelling and screaming  run, run, save yourself  run, run  but screaming it obviously  and bear ate him  and then went  and ate her.  Why would...  I'm so irritated  at that fucking director  for cutting that out.  Why would you cut that out?  Yeah, put the whole thing  in there.  A guy's making a documentary  and he's eaten during it  and you cut the audio.  It might have been  too gory for kids.  Yeah.  I don't want to compete  with the penguin movie. 
[00:46:30]  Do you know what I mean?  That's the danger.  That's what you get  when you lay out there  and hang out with fucking  bear shit all the time.  You're going to get  gobbled up sooner or later.  These people that go  with these wild animals  to document them  and actually start feeling  like they're part  of the animals.  The animals understand them  and they understand  the animals.  They're so full of shit.  They're wild animals  that will disembowel you  at the drop of a hat.  Someone listen to that clip  and see because that might  be worth playing  on the air today.  Oh yeah?  This is the corner.  Oh, the corner? 
[00:47:00]  Showing the metal box  that they brought  the remains back in.  Ooh.  And there was just  two big piles.  Who cares about man cow?  Jesus.  That was yesterday's news.  So anyway,  yeah, I'm thinking  that he set up  his own death  because he stayed  out there too long  and this guy  knew what he was doing.  He was out there  13 years.  He knew how to survive  among the bears  and he was hinting  like they have tape  of him hours  before he died  and he was talking  about his own death.  You know,  you have to be  so careful out here  or you could be  eaten alive  and blah, blah, blah.  The foreshadowing 
[00:47:30]  was a little strange.  Anyway,  Al Roker  interviewing an animal  behaviorist.  Listen to this.  Now,  we always hear about  and we see video  on the news  about these bears  and a lot of bears  coming into people's  backyards.  You see a bear  in your backyard.  What do you do?  Well,  the first thing  you want to do  is to avoid confrontation.  You don't want  to go and tackle them.  Grab whatever you have  nearby  and make as loud noise  as possible  and you don't want  to climb trees  because bear can  climb trees  and they can  absolutely outrun you. 
[00:48:00]  So if you need to,  back away quietly  but make a lot  of noise first  to try to get him  away from you.  I hate these experts  that they have on TV  stating the obvious.  Really,  make a loud noise  and walk away  or walk away.  Really?  Back away.  Most people  would walk  toward the bear  and try to pet them  on their cute little head  because they have  stuffed bears at home.  Isn't that what  this guy was doing?  Wasn't he walking  right up to the bears?  At times,  yeah.  But he was very, 
[00:48:30]  very cautious.  They showed some of that.  The best thing to do  is obviously  to keep him  out of your backyard  or your campsite  is secure your food.  Absolutely.  A lot of people  think they can secure  the food in their car  and bears have known  to break a car window  on different occasions.  The other thing is  people like to have snacks  before they go to sleep  in their tent  and the bear smells  the crumbs,  even the leftover  and they may pour  at your tent  which is not a good idea.  Are there any bear experts  that don't sound  like World War II criminals  that they could have interviewed? 
[00:49:00]  When would a bear  be most likely to attack?  Son,  day,  Wednesday,  Thursday,  Monday.  This movie is getting  such a buzz  that the bears  are going to become  the new sharks  you watch.  Is that it?  It's going to be all  about the bears  and how you're not safe  in our area.  Exactly.  Well,  Jersey has a lot of bears.  They're trying to get  a bear hunt together  because bears are showing up  in people's pools.  So that would be  a topical story  for this area.  Bears.  How to protect  your children 
[00:49:30]  against bears.  The solution is  throw a big rope  like 20 feet  over a branch  away from your campsite  then secure the food  and raise it up  about 10 feet  off the ground  so the bear  cannot reach it.  Yeah.  That's great.  So he's hanging out  smelling something  in the air  and he's trying  to swat at it  with his paws.  That's got to be helpful.  Yeah.  Well,  basically what you're  supposed to do  if you go camping  you take all your food  your leftovers  everything  you tie them up  in a bag  or a knapsack  and go way far  from your campsite 
[00:50:00]  and hang it in a tree.  That's convenient.  So they can't get at it.  So you're on your way  to pick up your food  the next morning  and you're killed  because you're bumping  another bear  who's been standing  there all night  looking at you.  Yeah,  waiting for the person  to come by  to get their food.  You know what I do  with my food  the leftovers and stuff?  I call down  and the room service  comes and takes  the trays away.  Yeah.  That's the only type  of food thing  I have to do  when I'm out camping.  Just rewinding slightly  you were talking about  March of the Penguins  and the penguin movie?  Yes.  Did you see in the paper 
[00:50:30]  today that they  put up a few penguins  in one of the nicest  hotels in New York?  Are you shitting me?  Because the penguins  are on a publicity tour?  A tour?  It's in one of the papers today.  This is why we are hated  around the world.  Oh yeah.  This is another example  of why we are despised  on this planet.  You're in a third world country  and you happen to get  the news of America  and you see this little story  of a penguin eating  caviar in a hotel.  Half of these stupid countries  that worship the thing. 
[00:51:00]  Did anyone find that  in the paper today?  I saw it.  Yeah, but I don't think  anyone would actually  cut it out  and think that would be  good for the radio show.  Hey, you didn't finish  your celebrity story  by the way.  I'm going to get back to that.  Opie, what happened to it?  We're just covering  a million things here  but now we have to stall  and find the cute penguin  thing for ourselves  because no one thought  it would make  for good radio today.  Here it is.  Now.  Penguins invade  Gotham City.  One of the city's  swankiest hotels  turned into a  cold sheets motel 
[00:51:30]  last night  for a pair of  pint-sized penguins  flown in from Florida  to promote the documentary  The March of the Penguins.  The very understudies  of the Emperor Penguins  of Antarctica  they are about  one-eighth the size  of the birds  in the documentary  were booked  into the Regency Hotel.  The Regency.  That is like  the most expensive hotel  in New York  or right up there.  Pretty expensive.  One of the top ten  I would have to say.  Where waiter  Henry Barista  above provided  room service  of herring.  They then retired 
[00:52:00]  for the evening  on a double bed  of ice.  They get room  service.  There are people  listening to this  program right now  that save their money  all year to hopefully  go to a nice hotel  with their loved one  or something  and take a nice  vacation.  Penguins are in  one of the most  expensive hotels  in New York  as we speak.  Later today  the stand-ins  will fly through  a publicity tour  including doing  live with Regis  and Kelly.  We better tape that.  We got penguins on.  Yeah.  We better tape that today.  What are they going  to ask the penguins? 
[00:52:30]  And they're on  the early show  on CBS.  See this is stuff  I hope our  Were we booked?  Did we have penguins  booked on this show?  Did they cancel?  They just didn't show up.  They didn't show.  They were scared  of the questions  we were going to ask  the penguins I'm sure.  The penguins are very busy.  Well they're very concerned  because they're half black.  They're concerned  what you might say.  Well I understand  that another morning show  all wants the penguins  and they can't do both.  Yeah.  I invented penguin robin.  Little penguins quacking. 
[00:53:00]  So there you have it.  Penguins in a hotel  in New York City.  And they got a cute  little picture  on the post.  Jesus.  I like the way  everybody's like  tentatively holding  the herring  like give the little fellas  because he doesn't know  if they're going to  snip it as little  awful Cuban fingers.  A little snack.  Alright so here's how  we wrap up  the whole first break.  So I go see  Grizzly Man.  And I actually  like the film  a lot.  I like to discuss it 
[00:53:30]  down the road  when more people  see it.  Anyway  I'm leaving the theater.  We're leaving the theater.  And there I see  Sean Lennon  walking into the men's room.  I'm like holy crap.  That's a biggie for me.  And  I actually was debating  following the men's room  which would have been  pretty creepy.  Yeah that would have been.  So then  so I'm like wow  that was cool  and I think nothing of it  and I walk a little further  waiting for Sean Lennon  outside the bathroom 
[00:54:00]  is his mommy  Yoko Ono.  The place is pretty much  everyone is freaking out  and she's making believe that  she's got to be making believe  that she doesn't notice  the commotion around her.  Because everyone's  walking out of the theater  like staring at her  like oh my god  oh my god  it's Yoko Ono.  Does she have anyone  with her or no?  Just some  some other woman  younger woman  maybe a friend of Sean's  I guess  you know  of Asian  or Japanese  what would you say?  Persuasion  I was going to say  persuasion actually. 
[00:54:30]  So of course  I'm starstruck  like anyone else  you know  when I saw  Keanu Reeves  walking around my neighborhood  I followed him  for three or four blocks.  You see some fucking  good ones dude.  I know  and you're in my neighborhood now.  I see no one.  I see Liam Neeson  from time to time  I saw Regis  the other day  miserable  with a bag of groceries  or something.  Plus I'm miserable  I'm interviewing penguins  for god's sake.  He was coming from  a corner like a store  I've seen Regis  a lot in my neighborhood  that guy  it looks like  is just miserable  when he's not on TV  he looks like 
[00:55:00]  he looks completely  different when he's not on TV  he just has a scowl  on his face  doesn't want to be recognized  and no one really cares  you know  but he walks around like  he's not a happy person  I don't know what that's about  that's my opinion  so  so  Sean gets out of the bathroom  meets back up  with Yoko Ono  and this other woman  and I'm like  we gotta follow him  we have to  because I know  they live in the neighborhood  you know  pretty close to where  I'm living in these days  Dakota right?  Yeah  so  so 
[00:55:30]  we go out of the movie theater first  because I don't want to  make it feel like  we're following him  from the get go  and we're outside  and sure enough  they walk out  and there's two cars  waiting for them  with the  it looks like security  where they even have  the earpieces in  I'm like wow  that's some heavy security  considering the movie theater  is only four or five blocks  from where they live  I'm like  they got a ride  just to see a movie  I thought that was  pretty interesting  so then  they start walking  and we just start  following them 
[00:56:00]  and that's when I called you  I wanted a picture  with Yoko Ono  really bad  because I think  that's a biggie  that is a biggie  sure  that's a real biggie  and Sean  you know  Sean Lennon's  walking with her  they waved off  the security people  that's what I'm getting at  so they took off  so now they're walking  the streets of New York  and I've heard that  Yoko Ono rarely does that  obviously  considering what happened  so I'm following them  and I'm waiting for  you know  a don't cross  sign or whatever  don't walk  so I can take their picture  but they're not stopping 
[00:56:30]  because they  obviously know the game  they're like  no way  so they're looking both ways  and walking pretty much  in between cars  they are not going to stop  but they want to have  a nice walk back  to the Dakota  everyone is coming out  of their shops  to stare at Yoko Ono  and Sean Lennon  like going  holy crap  I can't believe this  I'm calling you like crazy  what time was this  it was at  right around 536  I guess the movie let out  just in class  yeah  and I'm calling you  because you know this shit  I'm like  do I approach Yoko Ono  and ask for a photograph 
[00:57:00]  or is she going to get  all freaked out  because some celebrity  most celebrities  I would just  I would approach them  because whatever  might as well  because what the fuck  are they going to do  but that's what happened  to John Lennon  is the fan came up  and wanted an autograph  and stuff  well maybe she learned  her lesson  and she'll better  take one quickly  so I'm thinking  she's like  that's the thing  that just freaks her out  like are you kidding me  and I didn't want to get  into some kind of weird  like scene there  so you didn't call me back  because I didn't know  what protocol was  on this celebrity sighting  so instead 
[00:57:30]  I got the  I got to show you guys  I got the back  picture from the back  yeah I got the back  of their heads  which means nothing to me  maybe I could get this  can I get a  somehow get this picture  from my camera phone  online  sure  could have gotten  that same picture  on Mont Street  so this is what I got  the back of a couple  of Chinese people  I just got the back  of their heads  so and then I followed  them all the way  to the Dakota  I felt like a stalker  to be honest with you  you are one  you should have felt like one  what were you doing 
[00:58:00]  following someone  from a distance  and watching them  yeah and just  you should have  walked up to them  the only time I did  I saw I think  it was Sean Lennon  actually one time  in a restaurant  but they were eating  he was with Rick Rubin  and someone else  and as a guy  not in a restaurant  but you always walk up  dude  first of all  they're hugely famous  it's not like it's a kid  it's not like it's a kid  you know  you could have walked up  and just said hello  when Seal and Heidi Klum  had a little baby  I didn't approach them  because you got a kid  you just don't bother  somebody with a kid 
[00:58:30]  no it's interesting  not one person  asked for their picture  by the way  that's the beauty of it  be an ass  they might have said no  but at least they would have  probably would have said no  who cares  and it seemed like  this was a rare thing  because when we got  close to the Dakota  the security people  that were outside the movie  were right outside the Dakota  in their cars  with their earpieces  all nervous  like oh thank god  and then they went in  and that was it  yeah I would have gotten  or tried to  it's awkward though  yeah you would have  definitely  when there's three of them  you have no pride  there's been times 
[00:59:00]  where I haven't though  when it looks like  there's three of them  they're talking  sometimes it's awkward  you don't want to be  just a complete ass  but what does it matter  you're right  I mean I know you're right  like if they say yes  you got the picture  if they say no  even if they get pissed  you walk away  it's a good story  I always figure  it's a good story  yeah  you know  if they say no  the denials make  the better story  well the other thing too  I didn't care as much  because I had this  dumb camera phone  these things are useless  and mine doesn't have  a flash  so it's like  you know  I'm going to go out 
[00:59:30]  of the way to get a picture  that's going to look  awful to begin with  you know what I mean  so I was like  maybe if I had my digital  I would have been  a little more aggressive  I always carry my digital  why don't they just  put out a god damn phone  with a good camera in it  they can but they won't  of course they can  just put out a god damn phone  with a good camera in it  I'm sick of looking  at people's stupid pictures  on their camera phones  let's say hi to Dana  I'm a greeny mess  Dana what's up  well you know  I followed Opie one day  over in Huntington  in what's the mall over there  Walt Whitman mall 
[01:00:00]  and I wanted to know  what the protocol was  to approach you for a picture  because I saw you  walking with your Starbucks  and I said  oh my god there's Opie  and you guys just  got on satellite radio  and I didn't know  what the protocol was  to approach you guys  so what do I do  in the event  that I see one of you guys  everyone knows  we're very very very good  about that stuff  you come right up  and say hi  I had my husband  on the phone  I said I am walking  behind Opie  I am like stalking him  that's kind of creepy  I'm not going to do that again  I could stab him 
[01:00:30]  from here  her husband said  can you get a good shot  I totally felt  like a creepy stalker  but I was  I was starstruck  and I said  I need his autograph  and I chickened out  so  I just watched you  walk up the mall  and watched it disappear  and I left  and I was just disappointed  that I didn't approach you  no it doesn't bother us  at all  you come right up  and get a picture  or an autograph  autographs I think  are easier to get  than pictures  because someone  can kind of sign it  real discreet  without posing  and getting someone else  to do it  yeah but a picture  not a lot of people know 
[01:01:00]  it's better right  yeah and not a lot of people  know why they're taking  a picture  or who the fuck it is  if it's Yoko obviously  you know you know  but  I bet you they might have  said no no no thank you  and kept walking  just because  like Randy Johnson  was such a dick that day  because no one was  bugging him  that was hilarious  that blow off  was hilarious  yeah it was  I loved watching that live  you're mean  Jimmy getting shut down  by Randy Johnson  he's a prick anyway  and I'm running after  Jimmy with his little camera  two losers 
[01:01:30]  trying to get  Randy Johnson's picture  Yoko's really short right  tiny  yeah  tiny  did security walk with him  no  that was a weird thing  no not at all  nope  nope  that is odd  so  all I'm thinking about  is my primer  do you understand  that's in the back of my head  I'm obsessing over this  don't worry about it  you need something  that'll cover up that red  that'll bleed through anything  and primers  primers not gonna be  I guarantee  it's not gonna work out 
[01:02:00]  yeah it will  you can cover it up  alright  sure Jimmy  don't you sweat it  just email  Jimmy at  yellowtreats  at AOL.com  if you have  some help for him  so we can do a radio show today  because he's just gonna  obsess about that all day  I'm obsessed dude  alright why don't we  take our first break  Bob Edwards  stopped over  he got thirsty  Bob Edwards  today on the program  someone that interviewed  Yoko Ono  Dick Cavett in studio  we rescheduled this

[01:11:30]  Theo LeMasters  that's a radio name  Theo LeMasters  Theo  I don't know  this guy is  looking for one of our  golden tickets  hi  I guess this is my  oral presentation  for trying to get  my own show  on XM202  I'm 28 years old  got 10 years  experience in radio  I've worked for

[01:16:00]  let's get your head  and your ass  wired together  alright  the review is coming in  for that last guy  what was his name  Theo  Theo  Lee Masters  Lee Masters  I've been to more  exciting funerals  and why can't a bear  attack be caught on  tape involving  this guy  alright  he sucked  ass  the next show  looking for a golden  ticket  a show called  Tom and Terry  is it T-E-R-Y 
[01:16:30]  or T-E-R-R-I  T-E-R-R-I  uh oh  it's going to be a gem  where are they from  is it Tom and the Hole  we hate holes  I'm sorry  radio  as far as radio goes  I don't want  that came across  really bad  it certainly did  but when it comes to  radio and doing this  every day  we hate  we hate the hole  radio clam  let's just say it  we don't like girls  around here  we love girls  we don't like chicks 
[01:17:00]  we love girls  when we can exploit them  that's right  but as far as like  being an equal  in a radio studio  I don't think so  you like girls  when you get  a nice pink glove  here's Tom and Terry  you know what that is right  of course  alright  Tom and Terry  from KQRS  Minnesota  oh  I hate your  I guess I should  set this up  so they have a fair shot  this is uh  hoe  mow  a parody commercial  oh  a parody commercial 
[01:17:30]  hoe  h-o-e  mow  m-o-w  oh  I hate yard work  all summer and fall  I'd hoe the garden  then I'd have to  mow the lawn  I wish there was  an easy way  to do both  well now there is  introducing  the hoe mow  the all new  gardening machine  that both hoes  and mows  here's what people  are saying  about the hoe mow  I used to spend  hours outside  in the hot sun  with sweat  glistening on my  muscular chest 
[01:18:00]  and legs  then I realized  I need a homo  my husband has never  spent any time  inside with me  that's when I knew  he was homo material  the homo can pound  a trench through the mud  then trim your lawn  and suck the clippings  like you wouldn't believe  I told my husband  our neighbor was  getting busy  with a big old tool  so I looked out  the window  and I said  that's gotta be  a homo  we never thought  we'd see a homo  around here  the homo works  great all over  your property  in the front yard  or in the rear 
[01:18:30]  and it looks great  why that's one  good looking homo  there's never been  a better time  to join the  happy homo crowd  and with special  end of the rear  I mean year incentives  your homo dealer  will bend over  forwards to satisfy you  wow  I'm just curious  enough to buy  the homo  no family  is complete  without lunch  alright  I don't get it  I gotta be honest  I'm not trying to  be a buzz kill 
[01:19:00]  but I don't think  that the homo  is a real piece  of equipment  really?  yeah  I was gonna go  buy one  see every radio guy  including Ant and I  have done the  double entendre  oh shit  it's just terrible  but it has to be  based on  what?  and it's gotta be  fast  it hoes and it  mows Opie  so it's a homo  right  how about this  the homo  tears and robe  not included  wow 
[01:19:30]  I uh  yeah  that was a little  bit of a reach  yeah  I uh  yeah  good production  good luck to  Tom and Terry  do you have the  Willy Wonka sound  effect they're in?  well do they have  any other clips  maybe?  is that all they  send?  oh that's okay  no I'll hope  maybe they have a  better clip  that's just fine  we'll stop that one  they're terrific  I want to hear Terry  talk  that's okay  I like girls in radio  no you don't 
[01:20:00]  I do Ant  they're funny  do you guys want to  continue?  with the show together?  huh?  I mean as a group?  yes  as far as  the golden ticket  thing goes  yeah  we have some audio  from the hideout  a lot of people  talking about the  hideout  in O-Town  it might be an  actual radio show  in Orlando  that we like  and then we have  audio from the  Big O and Duke  show  oh yeah  Big O and Duke  Baltimore  yeah Big O and Duke 
[01:20:30]  basically they spend  their whole show  promoting our show  and they're  their managers  and their  their  I don't know  I'm stalling here  what are you doing?  oh I'm highlighting  so now I know  where it is next time  oh okay  basically  basically they spend  their show  talking about us  and promoting our show  and they're allowed  to do this for some reason  mind boggling  once again  that's today's word  mind boggling  mind boggling 
[01:21:00]  so without further ado  here's some audio  from the Big O and Duke  show  they're on WHFS  in Baltimore, Maryland  see how salty  Spiegel is  look he won't even  look at me  he won't look at me  I'm trying to talk  to him during the segment  he won't even say anything  Spiegel are you going  to participate anymore  on the show today?  no not today  or I don't know  he's on a skiff  why are you mad now?  well why do you have  to point to me now  and say that's a  different number  I didn't pull that  number out of my hat  Spiegel  the number  I'm talking  please  let me finish  my sentence  he's pissed  awesome  ratings 
[01:21:30]  that number  I didn't pull that  number out of my hat  that number is a quote  why are you taking  personal offense  to the fact that  you brought that  number up  because you make it  look like I made up  that number  alright there's a little  interest there  I don't know the  background of why  they're all pissed off  well you don't have to  be here either  that's true  I don't have to be here  if you don't want to  participate in the show  we won't go to you  are you going to quit  every month now  is this a new pattern  for you  would you suck it up 
[01:22:00]  for god's sake  suck what up  the attacks  be a man  who in this room  hasn't been attacked  viciously by everyone  else in this room  wow that sounds like  our show  that could just as  easily be  bah dude  I was on the phone  bah  I like it  yes Travis  has set that up  he quit smoking  and apparently  he was caught smoking  smoking yeah  okay  I don't need to be  yelled at  there's a difference  oh my god  do you realize  the people that we  work for  if you're having a bad 
[01:22:30]  day don't take it  out of our home  if anybody's listening  right now we need  kids gloves so we  can all wear them  to deal with Josh  here's what we need  to realize Spiegel  is that you're either  with us against them  or you're with them  against us  why do you think  I'm with them  because look at you  right now you've  this is like the  second time where  you've gone completely  off the handle  on the air  about something  that means nothing  who else went off  the handle against me  I went off  and in fairness  I was a little rude  to you  can I defend you  though  Oscar didn't stop  talking on the show  and stop doing his job 
[01:23:00]  damn I wish I had  some popcorn  kind of like him  I'd like to hear more  from these guys  let's see what they do  when they're not  arguing  yeah of course  so what's this  count Spiegel  calls in one  that's pretty much  I forget  this guy  when they came back  to drop the stuff  off  he said  count Spiegel  apparently is  supposed to be  Spiegel  who's one of the  characters on the show  it's supposed to be  his father  or something  and that's how  he set it up 
[01:23:30]  Spiegel  in my gigantic  Jewish  vampiric synagogue  castle  count Spiegel  why can't Josh  have  the pot-bellied pig  at the house  my son is not  allowed to have  a pot-bellied pig  it is unholy  and reeks of  garlic and holy water  I am count Spiegel  what about the puppy  why can't he have  the puppy  I do not want  the puppy  licking my face  with its  Christian puppy lips  I'm count Spiegel  god 
[01:24:00]  count Spiegel  thank you for  calling in buddy  son  son  yes  do not say  you love Jesus  anymore on the show  so Spiegel's  part of the show  and his father's  name is count Spiegel  there's something  really funny about that  I like the catchphrase  count Spiegel  I'm count Spiegel  what happened  count Spiegel  called him dude  what happened  I don't know  I missed it  so what are you  going to do  take a stand  and get the pot-bellied pig  or what  well I suggested 
[01:24:30]  I bring it home  for the weekend  just so we could  try it out  and we'll see  what happens  so was he cool  with it  maybe  I don't know  I miss Josh  I love Jesus  and I praise him  every day  alright  a little taste  these guys are  miserable in  commercial radio  a little taste  miserable  they passed  the first round  yeah  they should send  some more stuff  the Big O and Duke  show at  WHFS  in Baltimore  Maryland  Baltimore

[01:34:30]  let's say hi to Keith in Jersey  Keith what's up  hey  what's up  you know  the whole purpose  of me getting XM  in the first place  was to listen to you guys  not for commercial free music  which is cool  like if you guys  are talking to a pro wrestler  or something  or you know  maybe a topic  once in a blue moon  that I'm really not interested in  I'll put on some music  but 99 times to the 100  listen to your show  and so this whole golden ticket thing  is really starting to upset me  because I'm thinking  okay  XM's gonna give you guys  an extra channel  to throw  other shows on 
[01:35:00]  that would be cool  we're not playing  our cards to you yet sir  I'll tell you this much  most of our replays  will not be going away  okay  so don't panic  your pals are in control  alright  we'll get to hear you  all day long  I'll be alright  sir there's gonna be  at least two to three hours  over the course of the week  where you're able  to hear this program  that's just brilliant Jimmy  we got it all figured out  alright  alright man  you just go with it  let's say how to Pete  who's downstairs  Pete  he's on the street 
[01:35:30]  what's up Pete  on the sidewalk  what's up guys  hey  Pete  yeah I'm still chilling  down here  you guys said hold on  so I'm still  waiting by the  damn parking meter  oh you were the kid  that was outside  the station today  when I skated up  yeah that was me  with the sign  what was the sign  off the hill stand Jimmy  I enjoyed that  I had a good kick out of that  what did the sign say  what was that  what did the sign say  open up that sign  for me there  he's down there  with his friends  they've been waiting  all morning 
[01:36:00]  I was sat down  a fresh tranny  for Norton  for an internship  he's just holding  that sign up  on the sidewalk  are you getting  horrified looks sir  what was that  sorry  it's loud as hell  down here  are you getting  horrified looks  from the passerbys  we haven't been  holding it up  too much  we're pretty drained  we've been up  all night drinking  coffee  so we all kind  of want to die  right now  you guys want to  bring Pete and  his friends up  they've been waiting  out there all morning  with a sign  Pete you're the one  looking for the internship  hey do we have 
[01:36:30]  any icy hot  in studio  oh shit  we have some icy hot  hey bro  you want to do  the icy hot bit  yeah let's do it  we could rip  that off immediately  I'm going to be  completely honest  we're going to  rip off  the hideout  in Orlando  we'll give him  major props  this guy wants  an internship  we just played  the audio  of the hideout  doing the icy hot  thing  why don't we have  Pete do the icy hot  thing to see  what kind of 
[01:37:00]  gumption he has  we've got to do  something different  though how about  gasoline  gasoline and matches  right  alright we'll figure  something out  why don't we let  Pete and the gang  up  they've been waiting  out there all morning  but how about this  they don't sit here  because they might  disturb us  make them sit in  the office and  surround Ben  put all three of  them around Ben  let them just look  at him highlighting  in his email file  highlighting nothing  alright  highlighting  unhighlighting  scrolling  psycho  Pete we'll come  get you in a little  bit  Taylor in Virginia  what's up  not much guys  not much guys  I was thinking 
[01:37:30]  the icy hot  bit reminded me  awful lot  of the staple  gun bit  you guys did  on NEW  oh man  that shunt  happen again  the staple gun  challenge  how about you  have the parking  meter guy  come on up  and do that  with his buddies  knowing FedEx  he runs another  great OPA  and Anthony  fan site  called  OAVirus.com  it's a site  that has all  our old audio  I'm sure he'll  throw that up  there in the  very near future  OAVirus.com  but basically  at night  that was a great  contest  I never heard  of this one 
[01:38:00]  before  we kind of  who invented it  you take a  newspaper  and you put it  over your leg  and you take  a high powered  staple gun  not just a  staple or a  staple gun  and you put it  on the newspaper  and you  staple  now there's a  full newspaper  there so  it really doesn't  go through that  much  you might just  feel the tips  just pushing  on your pants  well in the  beginning you feel  yeah  and then  I would hand  the stapler  to Opie  who then  must remove  one page  from the 
[01:38:30]  newspaper  put the  newspaper  on his  leg  and staple  then he gives  it back to me  remove a page  and you keep  going back and  forth  removing a page  making the  paper thinner  and thinner  you feel a little  more of it  going through  it finally gets  through your  pants  and give a  pinch in the  leg  and before you  know it  when you have  maybe five or  six pages left  out of the  newspaper  you're really  catching some  meat with the  stapler  and I think  who won that  one  I think you  did  who won  that one  who won  dude  who won  that one  I won  nothing  go to 
[01:39:00]  one sheet  fedex get  that audio  up on  oavirus.com  in the next  day or two  who won  that one  that was  one of my  proudest  moments  I start  taking the  staple gun  directly to  my leg  that's  how you  won  I didn't  want to  eliminate  any more  paper  I'd had  it  my leg  was bleeding  and the  pants  just stained  with blood  the holes  in them  I still  got tiny  little  scars  on my  thigh  do you  really  oh yeah  bunch of  holes in  my upper  thigh  so you  guys  did it 
[01:39:30]  wrong  because you  made it  go too  fast  you should  have done  the same  bit with  a phone  book  one page  at a time  down to  Zabisco  alright  we're bringing  that kid  up  aardvark  exterminators  it's  going to  take a  while  Matt  from  South  Jersey  starting to  send in a  lot of  production for  this radio  show  and he 
[01:40:00]  came up  with this  Howard Stern  thing that's  hilarious  it's really  good  we caught  Howard lying  once again  on his  stupid  radio  show  he's  claiming  that  the  little  doggy  company  is  just  selling  subscriptions  like  crazy  because  of  an  announcement  he's  like  they're  already  over  3 million  subscribers  blatantly  lying to  his audience  the little  doggy  company  doing  well  satellite  radio  in general  is  going  to  do  well  now  the  securities  and  exchange  commission  would  feel  about  Howard  getting  on  the  air  and  bullshitting 
[01:40:30]  about  sub  numbers  basically  Howard  said  they're  over  3 million  already  because  of his  announcement  and the  fact is  the company  is at  1.8  so he  added  over  1.2  million  to the  actual  total  that anyone  could look  up  so we  discussed  that on  our show  recently  and Matt  from South  Jersey  took the  audio  and he  threw this  little thing  together  as we  go to  break  what you're  about to  hear  is Howard

[01:45:00]  warning  C word  alert  C word  alert  warning  warning  that's right  it contains  the C word  oh there are  several ways  to irritate  a lady  you could  mention  that a rat  has gone  out of style  oh that's  sure to get  a miffed  it's bound  to cause  a tip  but here's  a little  trick to  go the  extra  mile  give  a  just  a little 
[01:45:30]  kick  in the  cunt  a kick  in the  cunt  ah  kick  in the  cunt  that's about  a nice  kick  in the  cunt  you'll  sure  have a  stunt  if you  go for  the  hunt  with a  jolly  good  kick  in the  cunt  now a  lady  of  grace  will  show  utter  distaste  for a slur  or a  randy  suggestion  but if you  call her  a whore  it may do  nothing more  than make  a subtle  change  in her 
[01:46:00]  complexion  so give  so give  her a  kick  in the  cunt  a kick  in the  cunt  ah  kick  in the  cunt  that's about  a lovely  kick  in the  cunt  eh  if you  ain't to  annoy  there's no  better  ploy  than a  rousing  good  kick  in the  cunt  now you  might want  a sucker  of clopping  the choppers  a sucker  of making  a grappa  and knockers  but she'll  go the  coppers  and you'll  in the  jail  where you  eat  bread  and water  and shit  in the  pail  so if  you've  enough  of a  womanly  guff  no need 
[01:46:30]  to be  rough  it'll  be  quite  enough  to call  her  block  with a  huff  and a  puff  to  stuff  your  foot  straight  into  her  muff  just  an  old  fashioned  kick  in  the  cunt  a  kick  in  the  cunt  a  kick  in  the  cunt  as  about  an  ice  kick  in  the  cunt  you'll  sure  have  a  stump  when  you  go  for  the  hunt  with  a  jolly  good  kick  in  the  cunt  it's  on  we have

[01:49:30]  show  rock  icon  three  disc  DVD  set  available  August  16  2005  that is  oh it's  out today  right  it's out  today  featuring  nine  episodes  from  1969  to  1974  featuring  Janis  Joplin  David  Bowie  George  Harrison  Sly  and the  Family  Stone  Stevie  Wonder  and many  more  ladies and  gentlemen  Dick Cavett  there he is  hi this is  Bob joined  the Peace  Corps  Hope  I'm sorry  I had to  do that  I was giving  you the big  intro and then 
[01:50:00]  you went to  the bathroom  on me  not on you  you know how  expensive that  would be  I went on it  near you  we're trying  to be  professional  broadcasters  say again  we're trying  to be  professional  broadcasters  to give you  the respect  that you  deserve  and a nice  intro  and then you're  just wandering  around the halls  I know it shows  no respect at all  but that's my  generation  you know we don't  give a shit  darn  this guy  sitting here  Jimmy Norton  made me laugh 
[01:50:30]  so hard  so many times  really  it was nice  today to be able  to see him  and realize  that he really  exists  where have you  seen Jimmy  I haven't seen him  but friends tell me  about him  oh is that it  he is very funny  that's a great honor  thank you  we love our little  tough crab  yeah  oh you've seen him  on tough crab  I didn't notice  I didn't notice  when that left us  yeah they cancelled us  in I think  we knew by November  of last year  that we were done  wasn't that a great show 
[01:51:00]  you get all kinds of views  on a bunch of different  I know how it feels  to be cancelled  yeah  you've had that happen  a couple of times  but man you just  keep coming back  don't you  whenever it happened  to me  I always was  kind of exhilarated  by it  really  yeah  there will  there will be  something new  that's true  and there always was  it was true  several times over  yeah you definitely  have had your share  of firings  yeah  but look at me  I've still got my  head high  and I'm a regular 
[01:51:30]  little soldier  what the hell  am I talking about  you've carved out  an interesting niche  though  I don't think  there's anybody  that you can really  compare to Dick Cavett  because you  you were in movies  as an actor  you've done  the interview shows  which are great  you have a credibility  as an interviewer  yet you were part of  you know  the subculture  of the 60s  that you know  you appeared on  Laugh-In  and I don't think  you can really find  anybody that  is similar to 
[01:52:00]  Dick Cavett  today  gosh I wish I could  help you with this  problem  yeah well  I was just wondering  if you thought  of anybody  that kind of  fits the same  bill as you  in today's world  I probably don't  think in those terms  no  I always just thought  maybe something  will come along  again  and stay on  as long as you can  and on the ABC  network  people said  you might want  to kind of  brace yourself  because if anything  that goes more  than five weeks  was it Milton Berle  who said to end 
[01:52:30]  Vietnam or put it  on ABC  oh yeah  it'll be cancelled  in three weeks  brilliant  that's a great line  and you got  something in common  with Dick Cavett  Anthony  I do  yeah I'm reading  his bio here  he struck  he struck  friendships  with Stan Laurel  Woody Allen  and Groucho Marx  yeah  you know  I've been goofed on  Anthony's a vampire  relentlessly  he used to hang out  with Groucho Marx  I did not hang out  and look how good  he still looks  as a child  I met Groucho 
[01:53:00]  shortly before  he died  in the mid 70's  and they keep  talking about me  like I was hanging  out with him  your best buddy  Groucho  yeah me and Groucho  were hanging out  back in the 40's  no of course  when did you meet  Groucho  I never met  any of the other  brothers  but Groucho  I met  we could find out  the day  if we had to  it was the day  after I met  Woody Allen  I was sent  by the Tonight Show  to go scout 
[01:53:30]  this comic  at the Blue Angel  anyone have  note  Allen got  very few laughs  and turned  and left the stage  after what  you were scouting  out Woody Allen  at the time  for the Parr show  oh  the Jack Parr  wow  there's a kid  he wrote for  Sid Caesar  when he was 17  I thought  jeez  I've got to  know this guy  called him  voice didn't  sound familiar  thank you  very much  let people 
[01:54:00]  wonder what  I'm talking  about  Starbucks  coffee  Starbucks  bargain  coffee  and  after the show  I went  and Woody  was sitting  in the lounge  of the Blue Angel  and he said  they usually  don't laugh  very much  at me  but  he and his  manager  were in the act  of deciding  whether this  is a good idea  for him to be  a performer  we both  were saddened  by the death  of the great  George S. Kaufman 
[01:54:30]  who Groucho  always referred to  as his god  and we agreed  to go to his funeral  and Woody didn't  go but I did  sat down in a side room  it was overflow  the great Moss Hart  was doing the eulogy  and saying  I can hear George  in the casket  behind me  saying it needs cutting  and  a classy character  he was  and then I thought  Jesus  that  is Groucho  Marx  four feet 
[01:55:00]  from me  with a cigar  not lighted  and that  fabulously  intelligent face  and all looking  what year  was this  you know  I ain't sure  but it would be  in the early  60s  yeah  yeah  and I followed him  to the corner  and he left  with two people  I mean two people  left him  Art Carney  and somebody else  and  man  star-studded  in the crowd  out front 
[01:55:30]  at the funeral  house  you'd hear things  like hi Groucho  I'm Edna Ferber  and I thought  I'm a long way  from Nebraska  yeah  well is that  your only contact  with Groucho  or did you  no  I probably had  a hundred more  contacts  with Groucho  but I wrote  for him  for two weeks  when he took over  the Tonight Show  for two weeks  between Carson  and Parr  and I was  at his house  a lot  and he wrote  me a lot  one letter  I found  the other day  I don't know  how I could  handle it 
[01:56:00]  so carelessly  he said  it saw you  on the Griffin  show  and liked  what I saw  I think  you've hit  a mother load  with the idea  of the rube  in the Ivy League  I've started  in my act  write stuff about  I was from  Nebraska  but I went  to Yale  and they left  brown and white  shoes  and the white  one kept  getting dirty  it was one  sure fire laugh  yeah I just  proved that  every time 
[01:56:30]  I saw him  I was afraid  I was seeing  him for the  last time  yeah  oh I  somebody remind  me I'm on  the album  Groucho album  of Carnegie Hall  because I  introduced him  and I was  had just begun  being on  television  and when I  stepped up  from the  audience  onto the  Carnegie Hall  stage  there was  this  fabulous  thunderous  applause  and I  started to  step back  thinking I've  walked in  on somebody's  entrance  you were with 
[01:57:00]  Jack Parr  in the 60s  right  yeah  do you  remember  the Walter  Winchell  back and forth  that him and  Parr had  where I think  Winchell would  bad mouth  Parr in the  paper  and he was  like arrogant  and apparently  everybody was  afraid of him  and Parr  really gave  him a good  smashing  yes Jack  did he  he had another  one with  Dorothy Kilgallen  if anyone in  this room is  old enough to  remember what's  my line  he just  Jack  didn't get 
[01:57:30]  elaborate or  mince words  he just said  you have no  chin  but yeah  Jack gave  as good as  he got  certainly with  Winchell  and he won  right  didn't he  win  like  Winchell  they said  was unbeatable  and everybody  was afraid  of him  you know  going up  against this  monster in  the press  and Parr  just wasn't  afraid of him  and just  really gave him  a good beating  which I loved  I don't know  how much that  contributed to  Winchell's  decline  he fell in  love with me 
[01:58:00]  somewhere  called my  apartment  I don't know  how  and said  do you want  to go to  the Copa  tonight  the Copa  to see  Tony Bennett  or somebody  it wasn't  Tony  and I  suddenly found  myself out  on the town  with this  girl  journalist  heavy supporter  of red  baiting  and black  list  and all 
[01:58:30]  that stuff  but he  had become  a sad  old man  in a  tuxedo  that was  if it wasn't  a little  frayed  he made  it look  like it  was  by wearing  it  he had  a 38  in his  belt  and his  cummerbund  and he  used to  spend all  his nights  following  police calls  really  wow  Winchell  the police  gave him  a special  radio  the real  one  and he  still had  it  and it  was quite  sad 
[01:59:00]  so tempted  to say  you know  you're one  of those  hated  men  the world  has ever  produced  is that  pleasant  it's a little  odd  to be driving  around listening  to police  call  and oh  god  and one  police place  we went  to the scene  of a crime  or something  and a kid  said to  Winchell  oh hey  oh  do it  again  talk  say something  and Winchell 
[01:59:30]  did  and he  was the  voice of  the untouchables  on television  he wasn't  seen  yeah  but  that  like his  good evening  was the  North American  old ship  to see  let's go  to press  was  he was so  tickled  that a young  person  knew his  voice  when he had  dominated the  business  at one point  yeah  almost as big  as Arthur  Godfrey  now you  obviously  very involved  in television  in the 60s  what do 
[02:00:00]  you think  of what's  out there  today  just the  general picture  reality  television  journalism  today  say again  things like  reality  television  oh yeah  I haven't  watched any  reality  I watched  the first  one  and was  satisfied  the first  one  where the  guy was  walking around  naked  oh  survivor  oh the first  survivor  yeah  and I saw  what it was  like  and I  because now  it's just  I mean  every night  there's  four or  five or  six shows  on that  are just  a group 
[02:00:30]  of you  know  ordinary  people  doing stuff  in certain  situations  eating  unsightly  worms  yeah  fear factor  pretty little  worms  that we  all eat  yeah  it doesn't  interest me  very much  I can't  see why  some of  them  I may  have to  catch  that  but I  usually  don't  television  is largely  junk  and it  probably  always will  be  because look  how much  of it  they have  to fill  it's just  there's no  it's so  hard to  find clever  writing  anymore  or anything  that takes  any real 
[02:01:00]  talent or  creativity  out there  and  and they  still use  laugh track  or  yeah  yeah  where the  laugh goes  bah  bah  bah  and then  geez  Groucho said  that the  laugh  was writing  because you  didn't have  to be good  anymore  the machine  will always  laugh  you'll always  laugh  you never  get that  feedback  from a  live audience  do you  ever  this is one  of the  things i  always find  like when  audition i  get like you  said there's so  many channels  to fill and 
[02:01:30]  stuff but this  whole obsession  that there is  now with  likability with  comedian it's  just revolting that  they are so  obsessed with  somebody being  likable  that's interesting  yes this is  true  um and if i  never see oh  god i'll clear  the room with  this if i  never see  another stand  up comic  if i never  see another  stand up  comic i won't  feel the  loss  um so  many are so 
[02:02:00]  good so  few have  anything more  than uh  likability that  they're peddling  and there's  always one  350 pound  black woman  who uh  makes fun of  her morbid  obesity  and if you  stay tuned  there'll be a  355 pound  white comic  with that kind  of obesity  i don't know  how it works  where it looks  like great  bags of water  um and at  the risk of  seeing one of 
[02:02:30]  those again i  i pretty much  don't watch  just write it  off yeah  but it was a  fun time when i  was in the when i  was in the village  and wondering who  the little creepy  looking guy was  with the spidery  hands and it  was bob dylan  going from club to  club trying to get  get in somewhere  for that night  and play something  uh he knew bob  dylan before bob  dylan made it  that's amazing to  me he was just  walking it's amazing  to me that you  knew bob dylan  walking around the  village before  anyone knew  yeah several times  i thought i'm gonna  ask somebody who  that is that you  do see and he  was just walking 
[02:03:00]  around trying to  get on a stage  somewhere in the  village right it  seemed so yeah  that's apparently  what he was doing  because he wasn't  anyone anybody  heard of right  did you ever go  into cafe fiend  john in the  village which one  is that it was  uh it was just  like a little  cafe where musicians  would play and  like go up and  play and a guy  named manny who  then owned the  comedy show wouldn't  let bob dylan on  because he didn't  think he had any  talent  and uh he  is the head of  the nbc  well but manny was  always loved it you  know because he  showed us in 
[02:03:30]  in dylan's biography  he mentioned that  the only guy that  wouldn't let him  on was menachem  thorman he was  just so happy  like yeah  i thought that  he was the guy  you gotta send him  a little medal or  something to commemorate  the no i used to  see the darndest  people um cosby would  be at the bitter end  i would be at the  bitter end once i  survived dying unbearably  my first night at  the bitter end  silence records  the record-breaking 
[02:04:00]  silence  and i sort of  screwed it up  myself i was  nervous and i  thought jack  rollins and uh  it was what he's  a manager and  mine a lot of  people jack uh  will be surprised  at how good i'm  going to be because  i was a magician in  high school and i  always worked with  audiences and i  had lived and i  don't know i could  feel sweat damning  it dammed up over  my eyebrows and  ever so often it  released a drop  and i thought you 
[02:04:30]  can't reach up and  wipe it off and  they'll admit you're  sweating oh god i  have no idea how i  got off that stage  that night but it  was to the sound of  my feet how long  into it did you know  i'm a dead man this  is not going to be  recovered i swear my  life flashed before my  eyes a number of  times anyone tell you  a good job when you  walked off or couldn't  you fake that jack  being the classy man  that he is um left  about five minutes 
[02:05:00]  into my eight minutes  that i survived and  sort of waited outside  and he said well lad  you got you've what  we call fouled out  tonight but tomorrow  night you'd be ready  you're going to go on  at the improv yeah and  i thought jack look at  this mess we have here  me and it's a nice  good so you'll be glad  you'll do better i went  on at the improv the  next night with the  identical material and  can you see it coming  killed killed i've seen 
[02:05:30]  that exact thing happen  to jim norton as he  goes around town you  bomb five minutes later  on another set you're  doing great or the  worst though when you  have a great set and  then you go to the  next club and you just  start dying like an  animal i know you're  doing the exact same  thing the energy and the  rhythm is right and for  some reason the audience  is different it's really  strange amazing colin quoted  some comedian i don't  remember who the  comedian was but the  comedian said never  blame the audience even  though it's always their  fault i wish i can  that's profound who's  your favorite uh comic 
[02:06:00]  that you saw or  interviewed or just in  general who did you  think was the best i  always find it hard if i  make the mistake of  answering that question i  find later that um i was  wrong how about one that  just there's so many so  different i couldn't  couldn't pick out a  winner um how about  following was there one  guy you hated to follow  because a lot of guys  they hated following  prior like especially in  the 70s and the comedy  story oh well if i'd had  the chance to follow him  prior i would have hated  that too yeah was lenny 
[02:06:30]  work in the uh improv when  you did it lenny bruce or  carlin center carlin worked  at that no there is they're  a little older um but i did  see uh lenny bruce at  carnegie hall and i saw him  again at a concert at san  francisco and it said a  concert lenny bruce and i  didn't know what to say  to him in the dressing room  he said he didn't know me  and i said uh will you be  doing other concerts and  he said if my hands allow  who was the you've interviewed  everybody i mean you're just 
[02:07:00]  legendary for having spoken  to everybody who's somebody  has spoken to you at one  point it seems that way  doesn't it was there was  there one that you remember  that was just a really rough  one like a like a rough one  like a bad interview the  first time i had william f buckley  on um he really scared me  and i had had somebody tell  me once when i was at yale  that you should go over and  hear this guy who's lecturing  tonight at the he's the most  dangerous man in america  so i went and saw bill buckley 
[02:07:30]  and he was wonderful and  entrancing and hypnotic and  strange and intelligent and all  kinds of things in the middle  of the clunky interview i was  doing with him i said oh i'm  not familiar with that and he  said you don't seem to be  familiar with anything oh i've  never understood why he would do  that um to me or anybody yeah  it's the only time i've ever  thought he was nasty except when 
[02:08:00]  he tried to uh when he called  gorby doll a queer and i'll punch  you in the face and you will stay  plastered is the exact wording of  buckley's tough talk tough guy yeah  well worded but quite work but uh i  said i don't know what i did i  remember flashing into sweat just  and say oh i'm uh familiar with  everything  yeah there's really no 
[02:08:30]  you get defensive  to that one  hey buster  i went on to like him as much as  anybody he's uh my wife and i ran  into him in the caribbean and  boarded around and um he's really  an excellent uh fellow except for that  one awful moment in his life when he  said  say to someone let wherever it was  i don't seem to be familiar with  anything  you think he's being a creep or is  he just trying to be william f  buckley for you like sometimes  guys don't know maybe he was 
[02:09:00]  maybe maybe i should have been  prepared for that uh years later he  said on the show uh as oscar wilde  said hypocrisy is the compliment that  vice pays to virtue you have to sit  down with that for a little while  i'll write that one down for later  oh but get this i thought that's  not oscar wilde i know it's not  oscar wilde i was reading a book of  french witticisms over that very  weekend as luck would have it and i 
[02:09:30]  thought that's la rochefoucauld of  course everyone knows that and i can't  wait and i couldn't bring myself to do  it to her oh man you could i got him  back three weeks later and said bill  you have people on your show and you  like to keep a high standard of  excellence and accuracy and so on i  wish you wouldn't come on this show  and spread misinformation he said  what i said you know that line you  dropped a while back uh  i'm sorry i forget how i forget how it 
[02:10:00]  goes in english i don't even understand  it in english  well he was he was shaken just a bit  good but we remained good friends and  he's written the last of his novels of  the spy novels we got a lot of feedback  coming in and this guy says you have to  ask dick cabot about his garbage man  growing up  serial killer  the garbage man oh god yeah  charles starkweather 
[02:10:30]  oh my god that was your garbage man  i hate you know the name don't you  along with his girlfriend killed seven  people the springsteen song nebraska was  about him and his murders were  fictionalized in badlands and natural  born killers is this true you've got  somebody on there who knows what he's  talking about really  your garbage man was a serial killer  i was uh i was in college when i saw  headline nebraska murder with eight  point type or whatever the big one is  and i couldn't believe it in lincoln 
[02:11:00]  nebraska where i live where my folks  were  and i called home and my father said  yeah i i knew this unfortunate character  he was our garbage man my father was an  english teacher and he always befriended  and the dopes and sort of for  lauren type so he said i just attract  them like magnet and they loved him  more than anyone they knew and he used  to talk with starkweather because he  said i thought the guy had something  wrong with him and i just he seemed to 
[02:11:30]  like to talk to me and perceptive  yeah good call something wrong with  him six blocks away he was perhaps at  that point drawing a knife across the  throat of a nice woman um and carol  fugate his girlfriend got out finally about  two years ago  really they never proved that she was  involved and she always denied that she  was involved in the killings  is he dead starkweather 
[02:12:00]  he is quite dead  it's funny when you said i hate named  rock  yeah they uh they dim the lights the one  night  apparently that's a myth  yeah separate electric system the lights  don't dim like they did in the movie a lot  more dramatic though when they do  i like to think of it as i had a letter  i found going through some junk that i  didn't know what i how old it was or what  i had in it must have a lot of junk i do 
[02:12:30]  and i you know i find good interesting  stuff in there sometimes and here was a  letter and i looked at the return  address and it said squeaky from wow no i  tell a lie sadly more uh i'll tell a  lie it was um her real first name  lynette from yeah and it was a little  note about how i enjoyed my work that's  lovely likewise what are you gonna say 
[02:13:00]  it said something like you don't seem  like one of the enemy or some  wow like that that's how you know you  have a good like uh uh part of  collection throughout your career when  you're just stumbling upon notes from  squeaky from and groucho groucho squeaky  yeah pretty much covers i have signed  photos of me with like you know black  sabbath that are in a frame i know  exactly where they are he's stumbling  stumbling on the greatest shit squeaky  from that's what i was saying earlier  too is very interesting about you is  the the you know you pretty much run the 
[02:13:30]  gamut of personalities that you um i  don't know lack of a better word hung  out with uh-huh you know like you you  there there are people that fit into  certain niches you know conservatives  liberals the old uh hippie or  construction workers something some reason  you were able to really transcend that and  kind of spark up relationships with uh all  kinds of people i never consciously thought  about it but it certainly seems to be yeah  true and uh one day i had uh mark gastineau 
[02:14:00]  on remember mark gastineau the jet he  showed me what a quarterback sack was  like and um i just started studying aikido  um of martial art aikido and i thought i  don't know if this will work i don't know  if i've been studying hard now  that's the big boy tested on mark gastineau  i was going to step away and you know the  genius of jujitsu someone's genius concept is 
[02:14:30]  when push pull and when pull push a lot of  that's true in aikido aikido is a passive  martial art in the sense that you don't  attack with aikido you respond so when he  came at me with the sack i was going to  drop to the floor so he'd go over me and  fall on his face but i didn't have the  nerve to do that so i tried something  else and i said are you fairly strong  his head was here and his shoulders  there i said um would you find it  difficult to lift me and he said oh no 
[02:15:00]  i said okay grab me under the arms he  puts me up as if i were joel gray and  uh back down and i said i didn't have  nerve quite to say what i might do so i  said i'm gonna seem a little i'm gonna seem  heavier this time and gastineau says i'm  gonna tell the truth and i said yeah that  right we do please but let's go and i  again and i said okay it's going to be  difficult for you but lift me  no way mark gastineau could not get me 
[02:15:30]  off the floor and i loved it and the  principle is still not entirely  understood that was authentic that  actually happened absolutely and he  sat down scratching his head through  the rest of the show he really picked  you up at first and then on the second  attempt you did something to some kind  of voodoo magic yourself i'm not free  to reveal it but i can demonstrate it  defies kind of dull for radio listeners 
[02:16:00]  i don't know what made me think of that  except that you're saying about various  types yeah because the next day i'd be  out on the street and um passing a  construction site and they say hey what  was that shit with gastineau come on  let me try this you know so i had to  herniate several construction people you  could have just walked away dick of all  it's not like you have i didn't know  that pick you up of all the tricks you  pulled you had to get the one that  would make other men want to just grab  you and what can we learn from this 
[02:16:30]  did you ever get nervous interviewing  anyone i mean you've been i i we see  all the names of all the people you've  interviewed a ton of rock icons and uh  you ever sit across from someone and go  oh my god i hope they don't see me  sweating this out  nothing exactly leaps to mind usually  once i got out there i was fine  um no anxiety going into it like i can't  believe i'm going to talk to john lennon  or yoko no what what i would uh yoko 
[02:17:00]  you're talking oh i thought maybe you're  talking from the dvd because on there is  a segment of talk um oh well there's a  whole show with george harrison the whole  show is there and about a minute into it i  just suddenly struck me that and i said  so that a few days ago yoko ono was  sitting right there in that very chair he  leaped into the air like a man putting  himself out of the way um and i i assume 
[02:17:30]  she was amused by that  no no huh how was the uh the yoko  interview i i find uh i find her a little  annoying  yeah well i i uh it wasn't a separate  interview with yoko but it was when john  and yoko were there and um then came  back i don't have any idea how many  months later uh did a second show but you  know yoko was not considered a shabby 
[02:18:00]  artist even before she married lennon she  had a kind of a good reputation in the  art world um that does some ingenious  stuff when i met him they were in bed  you can't call that singing she does  ingenious stuff though right oh oh oh the  wailing you know what i wonder i haven't  seen all of the dvd but i i wonder if it  includes woman is the nigger of the  world yeah because on the first show i  had him on they wanted to sing yoko's  song woman is nigger of the world and i 
[02:18:30]  think and they did do it they had band  there wow they let him uh they let him  do that the network well afterwards they  decided this was unspeakable and  unacceptable this would have to go and i  said more is going to go than the song if  that's true wasn't i brave actually the  guy wasn't in the room at the time but  but um so we hassled over that i get the 
[02:19:00]  john lennon on for you how much better  guests do you want uh they sing as piece  of their own work and it doesn't condemn  anybody it's a it's the opposite of a  the idea that the the that a woman is  treated as badly as part of our society  and nobody's going to die if you hear the  word nigger in a lyric you know who side  this singer is on and so they said okay  but dick must make read a statement before 
[02:19:30]  the song and so you saw me saying uh this  song is kind of controversial and so on so  and uh you know i just i'm sorry if it  was going to offend anyone and i taped this  thing against my will but it got the song  on and the protest poured in saying things  like why did you make dick cabot do that  mealy mouth announcement before before this  song nobody complained about what they were 
[02:20:00]  afraid of you know it would have been great  if you said look if you read that uh thing  you said look this is the disclaimer and  you read it you'll look this is what i have to  read then you introduced her as the chink  oh god that reminds me of an instant i don't  remember it very well one of warhol's ladies  told a story about being on a plane back  from europe and the entire japanese business 
[02:20:30]  apparently got aboard this plane i'm making  it shorter and she said and i just thought oh my  god i don't want to die like this surrounded  by chinks and i wanted to say um well first  of all japanese aren't chinks they're nips or  yes and uh boy i think they cut that i'm not sure i  yeah i didn't much care in that case did you know um john 
[02:21:00]  lennon personally did you ever get to hang out  with him yeah i spent a good bit of time with them up  in their suite while it was raining outside uh when i  first met them and then uh well i put in some hours  downtown trying to keep him from being deported by the  nixon administration oh i'm sorry you're supposed to  real names here but the nixonites or  richard nixon's constituents or the great unindicted co-conspirators 
[02:21:30]  uh constituents were um really eager to get lenin out of the country and  they thought he was he would start a riot or something that  would overturn the government and and that he would be able to sway  vast numbers of people to something the government was afraid might  happen well he was more popular than god so well he they were right i mean he  probably he could have if he'd had a malevolent 
[02:22:00]  there was a huge i mean how would you how would you recover from losing the nixon  administration there'd be a lot of uh empty jail  cells i had several ones on who went to jail  including john mitchell the attorney general yeah  yeah but it's amazing amazing i am so sorry for anybody who missed watergate  because every day you couldn't wait to get up and turn on the radio turn on the tv see the 
[02:22:30]  paper who's been fired now what are they gonna  um it was very surprising on a daily basis  yeah and to have a disgraceful criminal as president is not um  a pleasant thing is it  well scandal wasn't as popular then or as as common in politics right because of the way the  media was that i mean back when watergate it was there is this just underlying trust you had of  the the people that were in charge and uh if not for their their policies you did for the office  itself and for the man that was yeah taking that office and i i think now you just assume that 
[02:23:00]  behind the scenes they've got to be screwing something up so back then though yeah it was a huge  surprise was amazing have a crook but did you hear me trying to talk politics with dick cavett and  sounding like an ass that i am he's talking about watergate i go yeah but back then you know  what a dope i am  i do apologize  no you're pleased you were informed i had nothing i just realized i just put dot dot dot at the end of 
[02:23:30]  my sentence where do you where you're too modest where do you get your news there's so many places  the internet uh tv uh papers i've been wanting to ask friends that thing you know people you know  that work at time or somewhere how much do you feel you need to read every week do you read  the economist and foreign affairs and the times and the washington post or the la times and  the nation magazine and the republic and somehow i got the feeling that because things are current 
[02:24:00]  they're important yeah like you have to realize they're not like you have to know everything  that's happening and going on and i might not know of it well it is thing there certainly was a time  where it was just the guy the desk and the clock at certain hours of the day and that's where you got  your news now it's just 24 hours a day wherever you want with different spins on it depending on 
[02:24:30]  which network you're watching and it's to fill the hours yeah yeah and it's kind of hard to get  just news without some kind of slant to it one way or another and hearing you say this i just realized  why on the news channels they waste god knows how many hours a day saying hello don how are you i'm fine  bill you know talk to the correspondent say hello and they have a back and somebody actually will say  how are you half of larry king's callers say how are you yeah shut up and get to the question you add 
[02:25:00]  all that up cover a few hours many hours that would be adding in thanks for your insights  hey you ever listen to bob grant here in new york i did i was on bob grant show one time so you know  he bob grant wouldn't people would go bob how are you he finally he would just go i'm fine  he hated it and that's exactly why it was just a waste of time you care and on a show where it's 
[02:25:30]  getting down to the last of the show and every time you want to hear everybody everybody's saying  hi larry love your show yeah we you got a lot of fans here in hartford  and you can see them want to shoot them yeah yeah we're stark weather when you need them  right but i'm taking your call thank you for taking my call yeah have anything to do with  call i know who you are a button was pushed probably automatically and you came on 
[02:26:00]  but you have to know uh you have to be in touch with current events uh what do you do do you do you  do you watch a lot of tv news or no i've i'm weaning my way away from giving up because  you do it you do start realizing that i've heard this story now four times today and uh no different  nothing is added well fox news makes it a little different oh well alert they have a fun fun spin on  everything we do a lot of uh we we replay a lot of the news teases that happen in our area and 
[02:26:30]  throughout uh the country actually people send them in because we love when they sensationalize  things on the news and just pound it into your head like there's imminent danger you know the car  you're driving could be unsafe for your children we'll tell you about it yeah and they just and then  you get to the story and it's really nothing how to save your life tonight at 11 tonight at 11  the food you're eating right now could be deadly what but i'm i i gotta eat dinner before 11 what are 
[02:27:00]  you doing to me television amazingly is amazingly limited and there isn't much that that goes well  on television and certainly they haven't solved the news problem yet and radio news was as with  everything on radio hit you deeper than watching a confusing picture and then that thing the other  that the news channel do somebody is talking interestingly and filling the screen they then suddenly drop 
[02:27:30]  him to one sixteenth of the screen up in the corner and we say the same damn al-qaeda soldiers doing  the hand walk across that thing because someone mentioned iraq right and you want to say what am i  supposed to watch the bloody ribbon the person you reduced to a postage stamp up in the corner or the  exciting news films they're 20 years old by now yeah it's just it just seems that there's no real uh credibility 
[02:28:00]  anymore in news there's no there's no cronkite that you're going to tune in and and he's got that respectability and the credibility uh you know you now you're watching a fashion show or you're watching the better graphics and you know who would sit there anymore and watch that old wooden desk with the ticking clock behind him you know now it's it's all  all about the flash and i think it's very hard for the average american to get news that's accurate these days yeah and and people who talk in their own words whose words they're going to talk in they're going to read to you uh and i i honestly got the great tom brokaw how he allowed himself to say with a straight face almost every night uh now in depth 
[02:28:30]  the such and such story 84 seconds later the in-depth story was over  and you went back to in shallow now brokaw is much too much too smart for that oh man there's a piece here in your um 
[02:29:00]  with it when they have like you know the little the the sheet on you and it said you were sued in 77 for not showing up for a radio show  for for uh manic depressive episodes that's something you still uh kind of do it because i kind of go  through not i don't know if it's manic but bouts of just just complete misery oh yeah i i did a  for i think the third time larry king with bob costas uh hosting it not many weeks ago no matter how many 
[02:29:30]  times you do talk about depression people uh say to you in later months and years you know you  you saved my life now when you hear that you feel like maybe you've done something good um  or uh my dad thought if if you could get this maybe it's all right that he could we were never able to  get him to a doctor until we saw you on sally jesse or larry's show or something like that 
[02:30:00]  it's such a it's probably rivaling obesity as epidemic proportions of how many uh people have  it and uh thank god we have people like tom cruise who in their infinite in their infinite wisdom  uh will in effect go on television and tell people not to take their medicine that scientology is a better 
[02:30:30]  just gotta authority you know get rid of those thetans well if i look like tom cruise was banging  the girls he banged i would be smiling all the time too right look like me and be happy  but it must be interesting to town  it's got to be interesting for a guy to be that successful and that rich and that dumb  yeah you know it's so strange and people whom he would sneer at but professionals have said 
[02:31:00]  uh he seems like a man in some trouble yeah um did you see lewis black on cruise  oh what on the daily show yeah i missed that one he said uh cruise has said that there is no such  thing as chemical imbalance well then what the hell is this thing that's happening to you right now  oh i love black yeah hey a lot of people are coming up with this ask cavit about the guy who 
[02:31:30]  died while he was interviewing him it was some gardener uh guy and he thought he put him to sleep  when he actually died while being interviewed wow true i don't know what the hell you're talking  about a lot of people calling in with that one oh there's no uh yeah they did a guy died uh on the  show and when i bring this up because you were actually interviewing a guy and he died in front  of you uh a moment later i wasn't actually speaking to him at the moment but uh when i tell this at a  college or somewhere and say what i'm going to talk about what about the guy died on your show 
[02:32:00]  i said it's obviously not a funny subject but you will be laughing approximately two and a half minutes  into this and they are because among the odd facts of it is of all the people in all the world who  would die on a television show who could be better than a publisher of prevention magazine  and many many other publications the rodale press uh who by the way are just have just came out with uh 
[02:32:30]  uh let's see oh wait was it wrote it maybe i should check my facts on this um  yeah let me let me let me uh take a cesura here that's the word i picked up on 20 days to a powerful  vocabulary uh the guy came on and he was very funny he'd been on the cover of the new york times magazine  that week he looked like trotsky if you're up on your russians and he had the little beard 
[02:33:00]  he was very amusing um and i made a mental note to have him back let's laugh one  when his half hour finish and we got to the 12 30 turnaround and i brought pete hamill  the journalist out and while pete was talking to me and mr rodale was sitting one down  he went rodale now you know if joey bishop and buddy hackett were on a show together 
[02:33:30]  often one of them would pretend to snore while the other one's talking and get a laugh  and people laughed at his snoring oh my yeah i didn't i thought this guy's dead  and next thing i knew i was on my feet standing in front of him and holding his wrist  but like there was no time in between it was like a dream sequence and i thought i don't know what the  hell a wrist is supposed to show you or anything but i thought i'm the captain of the ship i'm supposed 
[02:34:00]  to do something i said is there a doctor in the audience years later when katherine hepburn first  i first met her and she said before anything else i want to hear about the man who died on your show  uh and when i got to that point about i said i hesitated and said in the audience and she said  because you knew is there a doctor in the house would get a laugh and of course it would have  of course she was shrewd that woman uh next thing i remember is they've got his shirt ripped up 
[02:34:30]  showing the chest you know and the and the terrific pounding that an intern from across  from the fire department uh had and there were one or two nurses in the audience and they came up  and another guy no actual doctor but he was clearly uh he had joined the silent majority by the time he  hit the floor wow hold on to the floor by the way the silent majority thanks to gorby doll for this 
[02:35:00]  it was a phrase that was huge in america some years ago yeah it actually comes from uh herodotus and it  means the dead really and gore said it's nice to know that the republicans know who their  constituency is the great silent majority administration yeah um and please please tell  me that after that guy died on the show please tell me you had a comic scheduled 
[02:35:30]  we couldn't have two deaths in a row oh god what it was it was really it was quite awful  and sure is this on live tv because you're out no it was never aired so it never aired okay but it  might be someday under certain circumstances which i was talking to somebody about but um  there we were with our makeup on and our band over here and our lights and to show us up good to the  people sitting in the audience and a dead man is in the middle of all this there were i remember two 
[02:36:00]  stewardesses in red uniforms who had been winking at me in the front row nice and i suddenly looked  down and they're both crying and the audience didn't understand all at once the situation it sort  of moved backwards slowly until as if people think do you think suppose he's dead this is part of many  thought it was part of the show and that it was going to blow it off some way that is why i had 
[02:36:30]  five or six objects in my pants pocket none of which were mine and somebody had handed them to me his  watch and pocket watch and dentine gum you know oddities like that i don't remember ever seeing them  or having them handed to me and we checked and he was doa at roosevelt hospital  wow but hamill sitting there when rodale snorted 
[02:37:00]  turns to me and forgetting that you can't really whisper something on live television with the camera  there and your face in close-up goes i think this looks bad and that was before we knew the worst  uh but only seconds before hamill got a great column the next day it was just well that was an  odd thing about i'm in the crowd of people concerned pushing what do we do somebody running out with 
[02:37:30]  oxygen machine that had two parts and they didn't know how to fit them together uh all all of that  going on in the middle is hamill making ready a born newsman yeah and i may be missing the point  but the hottest part of the story to me is those two crying stewardesses well i just made them up for  you well dick you're on to a new project it's called uh rock icons the dvd comes out today i guess  three disc i guess it does today i get i get to go over to borders at six i guess which borders uh the 
[02:38:00]  one in the columbus circle okay isn't it yeah and uh when my second book came out another young writer  named cdb b brian and i went to the yale co-op because we'd both gone there to do a signing  four people showed up count them four the the publisher had screwed up which is a publishing 
[02:38:30]  world's greatest talent we've we've been in that position calvin trillin bud trillin or calvin  trillin wants to write a book called an anthology of authors atrocity stories about publishers when was  this that the four people showed up to a book signing at the yale co-op here's dick and this  other guy cd b b brian writer and they're both from yale and sat us down and waited for the  hordes to arrive i think actually it was in that position you just write your name really slowly 
[02:39:00]  hoping more people show up and you should have been here when the crowd was here you have a 10  minute conversation with each person hoping the line builds i think it was three people in a  cleaning way you talk to people after you sign for them like so where are you going here i'll give  you another one anthony and i have been in a position where thousands of people show up and  then you know we've also had the handful and you start like stretching things out you have 10 minute  conversations with each person yeah you propose marriage whatever it takes to make it look like  it's more than it really is say will this cause any trouble if i tell you that i went to see 
[02:39:30]  a thing on my tell you type your own name in ebay and up comes about 15 things and cassettes  yeah and um dick cabot autograph rare  and i thought i'll turn to it and see what it looks like oh boy here we go  it was no more my autograph than it was helen keller  and certificate of authenticity we just did this bit on our show did you really we just had somebody 
[02:40:00]  bring in presents for us and this guy brought me a picture of jack uh nicholson from the shining  uh signed uh and i was like wow that's great he said because there's a certificate of authenticity  behind the picture in the frame so i took the picture out and looked and it was something you can print  off a computer at home it wasn't signed or no stamp nothing and then i went online and started looking  on ebay at jack nicholson uh autographs and they're so different each one of them to the point where i didn't 
[02:40:30]  know what a real jack nicholson uh well jack's a very changeable guy and when he's in one mood the  autograph looks one way and yeah probably uh but i'll tell you i really lost faith that it was uh  authentic you got to be careful like i bought recently uh i actually had a really weird thing  babe ruth signed one of jeter's rookie cards and i bought that and that's a really tough find  good god oh i hate to break it to you but i have one  i've seen those in the store like you walk in the store and they have like babe ruth but it's in like 
[02:41:00]  that newer blue marker i know it's like who's buying this shit there was one at bourbon street in new  orleans and it had three baseball players of widely different times and ages all done in the same flare  yeah who's believing that i guess there are people dumb enough yeah there are obviously yeah yeah  because uh the ebay thing alone when you look at that people are people are buying the autographs  off ebay and there's no way to verify that well we're on ebay right now and under dick cavett's name 
[02:41:30]  there's some great stuff uh an old playboy that you were in 1971 yeah it's selling for a dollar and  95 cents i bet that's a very hairy issue it is sort of a lot of people were appalled that i said  certain naughty things really and it just goes on and on i think until jimmy carter was in playboy  it was kind of dirty to be in playboy oh yeah yeah and then once jimmy carter kind of he confessed  to lusting in his soul yes um i'm looking for a dick cavett autograph is there a lot of jimmy 
[02:42:00]  hendrix a lot of jimmy hendrix yeah he's not on this particular thing we're talking about now the  the dvd because rock icons dvd in alliance with the uh hendrix family brought out of one already that  was uh i think it's in dvd but it's all over my website as my own book cavett 895 harkett brace  ivanovich a book which one comic after another has said saved his life really yeah um they'll say i was 
[02:42:30]  i was out you know i was totally unknown i played a club in waukegan illinois and there was never a  sound from the audience you might not as well have been on the stage and i was suicidal and had  another eight days to go through the same thing again and i found a part in your book about being  stuck in detroit as a comic uh in a club called uh my god i never thought that the mind would erase 
[02:43:00]  the name of it from like freud i'll put it out of my mind and then it'll come back in uh  front row almost touching your knees would be a big lug with his back to you eating lobster  uh with both hands and his wife similar and it was while they'd take a glance at you and dismiss you 
[02:43:30]  there's not anything there instead and the worst part was you could see yourself did you ever have  that uh mirrored wall yeah that's just death because you know don't look at it and yet you can't stop  change your posture and all you keep being afraid you're not going to see your own reflection like  some kind of a vampire like jeez i'm really not here one night in san francisco i had the silence  the real silence and alan woody had written me a letter about three weeks before saying 
[02:44:00]  a fast note to explode the myth of the hungry eye the great uh club and atmosphere and so on that  nourished mort saul and nichols and may and so on is long gone so that encouraged me to go  to san francisco rollins had booked me there and this night it was you you ached from the silence  really and you'd go oh i got at least i got my chinese german food joke that always kills them 
[02:44:30]  nothing chinese german food an hour later you're hungry for power um nothing and then i heard myself  i heard myself say oh bless you i wish i'd had that we do that when someone uh has a joke that  bombs we do a whole thing here but that's painful were you in detroit that week i was playing bless you 
[02:45:00]  i wish i'd had that the four seasons no the four something oh god anyway i just there was a long  pause and i heard myself say why don't you all just get the hell out of here  now that is going badly yeah and that was shocking that didn't get a laugh and then two  what lenny bruce used to call diesel dykes um were in the front row with their boots on the stage 
[02:45:30]  and i was going to kick them off but i thought better to say why don't you all get the hell out of  here with this the two diesel dykes got up and went to they both looked like clint eastwood  it was kind of an interesting pair and they both got to the door and i said to one of them who was  looking back there are no refunds and she said we'll take a chance and she got a laugh that all 
[02:46:00]  those people who were incapable of laughter and had it left out of them by nature  laugh for her and i had a tape of that show i don't know if i do anymore it's reel to reel  and you can hear my steps leaving leaving this you should you should release that  i know i really should if i could god damn you're right there's nothing because to me there's a  comic like cure comics i don't ever want to hear about a comedian having a great show i could listen  to death stories all day yeah it's it's human something fast even if it isn't that's the same 
[02:46:30]  with me all right dick this was uh awesome you got to come back on our show because we just touched  the surface i mean i want to i want to you know hear you talk about jimmy hendrix and janice joplin  and all that is to give time for a quick joplin yes quick chance i would love janice and she  i think she was on four times and i notice on this because you get her all of her appearances on here  that are still in existence at one point i don't know why i said did i read somewhere where you 
[02:47:00]  got a tattoo somewhere near baltimore she said honey it's a lot closer to home than that  that shows a very complex comic mind um  raquel and jan and my my dear friend janice and my dear friend raquel welch were on one show together  along with um brinkley of huntley and brinkley i mean a huntley of huntley and brinkley 
[02:47:30]  and douglas fairbanks jr perfect combination of people really geez you have great friends i hang  out with these zeros  oh god all right uh oh god no wait a minute i've dislodged my story from my own brain  raquel welch  oh yeah there was something about virgin something i actually wasn't listening very closely  and was immediately snapped awake by raquel saying well i think janice would be perfect casting for 
[02:48:00]  the virgin and this got a kind of you know there's going to be a trouble but janice just said  ain't that good an actress honey this was perfect at that moment here's something that'll strike you  was virtually without humor um i said to uh the great majestic august figure of chet huntley who  loved raquel welch and announced it on the show and i said this this needs a footnote 
[02:48:30]  you can't leave because there'll be nobody left in the country saying good night david  except julie nixon now would you believe that that got the opposite of what happened just now  it was  no i'm telling you watch the show you'll see  dick why don't you get the hell out of here 
[02:49:00]  well i don't mind if i do it's the dick cavett show the rock icons it's a three dvd set and  you're going to be signing copies of this at borders in columbus circles sometime today i think i go over  there at uh at six and get my body makeup on a lot of great performances from jazz joplin bowie  george harrison sly and the family stone stevie wonder and many many more you got to come back and  tell more stories dick yeah i got a few more we're happy you came we were certainly thought you didn't  come last week we were like worried like ah tavis not gonna show up he kind of castles we're very happy 
[02:49:30]  yeah what did i need with this show we're happy you came no thought you were on to us  all right to our potty mouth show you guys let's thank uh dick cav for stopping by  absolutely thank you welcome anytime if you'd like to come back to this mess  i can stay now for a couple hours  if you want i mean we just got to get a uh supercross guy in that's doing uh has a movie out  and we got uh mark maron who's uh a very talented radio guy screw him  he's a lefty he's a lefty big time lefty is that good i don't know you tell me lefty 
[02:50:00]  i come from the time when they tied children's arms behind their backs who were left-handed  i think he means uh as a politics right yeah i know okay yeah he knows you never explain a joke  to cavett i'm explaining to dick cavett he's too smart for us we're gonna take a break and we'll  continue dick cavett i like a nice joke once i know about it or he might be stepping out we don't  even know at this point dick cavett everyone he really doesn't care about our lives and i hate  you all oh and i hate you all oh and i hate you all oh and i hate you all oh you gotta have me 
[02:50:30]  look jerky i don't need to talk to you all right kids hold on your hats one two three  show blows monkey ass  show blows monkey ass monkey ass 
[02:51:00]  it's our show you tool  it's our show you tool  i can't go on 
[02:51:30]  opie and anthony  come on it's not funny anymore  make it stop  make it stop  the opie and anthony xm202  coming off freaks  wow that was interesting huh 
[02:52:00]  what's that supercar  i will uh i guess we'll explain in a second here we're back with the opie and anthony program on xm  satellite radio want to first of all thank dick cavett for stopping on by  we found him very very interesting as a legend  it's really weird with this show because uh you do something a little different 
[02:52:30]  because people expect a certain thing for the opie and anthony program so then you go in a different direction which we like to do  and you get people going oh my god that was such a breath of fresh air i really enjoyed this segment  it shows that you guys can go in different directions and then you got a bunch of asses  well first of all the feedback went crazy and it was like 50 50 half of the people love the dick cavett thing  absolutely loved it  and then the next post is like dude what do we do to you guys you're putting us to sleep  yeah there's a few of those  it's unbelievable  and then there's people that just love it 
[02:53:00]  you can't satisfy everyone at the same time  that's what's frustrating when you do a radio show  jimmy i'm reading the uh instant feedback  half the people absolutely love dick cavett on our show  thought it was very interesting it showed a different angle and a different direction that we could take the show on  show in  and then there's a whole bunch of people saying hey what do we do to you guys you're putting us to sleep  yeah and then you get i love the shock jock stuff but this dick cavett interview has been hilarious  bottom line is you get a guy like that a legend who's willing to come in 
[02:53:30]  and sit with you  it's like it's great to have him in here  i mean what do you want just dick jokes all day i mean it was nice to have him in here man  i actually had to call uh you know my uh station he's on my show tomorrow and i had them cancel everything else  so we're going to do three hours  really yeah  with dick no  with that it's mark baron everyone  yeah  good fella  there's a show for air america right mornings i am on morning sedition on air america radio 
[02:54:00]  i'm also a uh stand-up comedian along with jim norton  yes  i saw you at the club the other night right  we uh yeah he loves to discuss politics with anyone and everyone at the table uh waiting to go on stage at the comedy cellar  yeah  i get in fights with some people but that was weird to see cavett because you know  he's got that look you know my my father  is a manic depressive  which i is very exciting half the time  uh  and he got that look the other half not so exciting people don't understand depression but i'll tell you manic depression you don't know what it's like to live with a manic the thrill of the delusional phone call at three in the morning with the big plans my father will call me up three in the morning just like marky up wake up 
[02:54:30]  listen i got an idea we're gonna open a fucking theme park what do you think like disneyland only bigger than disneyland it's gonna be marin world it's gonna be great  i just called this eve would work there if i if i open it would you work there  i'm like all right dad can i run the bipolar coaster  call me when you're crying don't kill yourself i love you  is that sad it's sad right  yeah but it's accurate 
[02:55:00]  yeah you know  it's very accurate  i you know it's weird because he's talking about depression i talk about it a lot lately because you know a lot of people think it's genetic and a lot of people think they're depressed and not depressed and i'm not like a tom cruise i'm not a scientologist so i'm afraid of scientologists  uh it's weird because i you know i read about politics you read anything i mean i'll read anything  but i walk through times square if i go into the trade station i see those scientologists i will not go near the book dianetics i won't go near it i not even but see not even to just go what are these guys all about because i don't know how grounded i am what page does it happen on right i mean you know how the hell do you you trust yourself that much that you're just gonna be like page six oh i don't care about my family they're the ones that broke me when's the mothership coming you know i mean when does it happen you're stronger than everyone in dian in uh scientology yeah exactly you're the one that it's not going to affect yeah the next thing you know you're sitting there holding cans out to people going you want to take a stress test 
[02:55:30]  but how are your thetans exactly they're in me i uh you gotta get rid of them mark do you do the cell phone joke i do do you mind doing it  hold on no i'll explain why no i know i'll explain why i go to the commie cell a lot and yes i was there recently and saw you and you absolutely killed 
[02:56:00]  and i was uh so excited about that joke and um a couple others i heard that night it came right on the show and i kind of try to explain it to these guys  and i always do other people's material horribly i don't give it justice so now i feel like i have to  have you do the joke to well now this is my face a little bit i i keep adding on this you know and we  don't usually ask comedians to do their jokes by the way this is very rare that's okay but it was just one 
[02:56:30]  of those things i had brought it to the table and i so excited to tell it to the guys and they looked at  me like well it's like it don't ever get on stage well it's weird because now that i'm on the other side  of it because i'm hosting my own show and i have comics on i really try not to do that but i know what it feels like  to be on both sides of this thing there's a couple things i noticed because there's certain guys  like we do these live remotes now and when you i've actually started setting up a mic separate from  sitting down if i have a comic on because he'll be like well should i sit down or should i not sit  i'm like oh maybe you should stand up and i'll do the interview from there because they can't help 
[02:57:00]  themselves right like they may not want to do material right listen i'm talking about us like i'm like  i'm a fucking different person anyways you're part of us today what i'm getting to is uh no i'm not  going to do the phone bill i appreciate no i'm kidding yeah it's okay i don't blame you if you  don't want to what do you i mean you know what i mean well anyway it's weird because we'll have  comedians in and they'll remain uh nameless but they just say hey how are you and all of a sudden  they do 15 minutes of their material like yeah what just happened can we talk because if you're a  funny guy our philosophy is if you're funny in general then come in and hang and just be funny and 
[02:57:30]  and and you know jump in when you can but some of these guys feel like it doesn't matter what show  they're on they just have to get their 15 minutes of material out well in defense of some comics  they're incapable of conversation uh and and they don't uh sometimes they're socially that's why  they're comics is that they you know you're sifting down thank you see you later hope i sold some  tickets but uh that's what i notice when i go to the cellar and i won't uh call anyone out again but i  go down there a lot and i see the same guys doing the exact same material making it sound like it's 
[02:58:00]  off the cuff and so yeah let's i guess part of the job you know but some guys do it differently  it's weird because todd berry comes out my show and i was i did what you did i said hey you know  that there was you that what about he just looks at me goes ouch buddy you're not trying to lead me  into one of my own bits are you but that's a funny dude man we want to he's very funny he didn't come  up in the office yeah it'd be great to have you yeah he's a funny little man he's very funny all right  so this well basically the idea the uh the cell phone the cell phone piece if i over the cell phone  i know i'm doing this uh is uh i i i can't not have my cell phone if i do if i leave my house 
[02:58:30]  on my cell phone i go into some sort of lack of cellular induced anxiety disorder you ever have  that moment you're like wait a minute wait fuck the satellite doesn't know where i am what if someone  i don't need to talk to needs to get hold of me they can't i'm just an unidentified human object  floating freely on the global information grid with no beacon no point of reference i am meaningless  on a cosmic level without my cell phone i get a good deal on mine it's only 900 a month  uh why do people have that well what is it 100 a month or you go three calls over the 300 a call 
[02:59:00]  i don't know i don't understand my bill there are 50 pages six columns of numbers by page four i'm  like what the fuck is this i have to masturbate to get through the bill because that's what i do  when i get uncomfortable and stressed out i masturbate has nothing to do with numbers but  my phone has a bach beethoven wagner on it little snippets of classical genius being heard the way they  were meant to be heard small handheld communications device hundreds of years after the death of the  composer have we no respect for genius beethoven wrote symphonies to be heard in symphony halls what 
[02:59:30]  do we do with it beep beep beep hey it's beethoven i wonder if he wrote any other songs  and do you think beethoven had any inkling and even the darkest recesses of his uh unconscious when he  was deaf and sweating over his fifth symphony that one day would emit from some idiot's pockets  and the response would be fuck it's my mom and isn't that wrong am i reading too much into it  i'm not comfortable you know i'm not comfortable with technology in general this is my other fear  about the phones is i don't update mine look at this antique because you know i'm an asshole i just 
[03:00:00]  use it to call people i don't take pictures with it do you remember there was a time where you  actually remembered your friend's numbers what a dark period that must have been now if someone  asked me my number i'm like fuck i don't know let me check if you have a blackberry and a cell phone  and they're in the same bag and you lose it you're two hours away from digging through garbage cans  going what's my name where do i live but uh but i don't update my technology and it makes me nervous  because i know at some point you know i don't even know what this one does you get the the little  guidebook you figure out what you need to do with it but i'm sure at some point someone's going to 
[03:00:30]  come by me like hovering two feet off the ground like flying literally and i go what the fuck is that  they're just going to go i don't know my cell phone does it fuck what is mine do it i gotta get a new  cell phone so there you go that's uh that's the boat very nice man thank you for doing that for  us sir it's no problem man it's uh it's fun to be able to talk freely and to be able to uh  to be on a radio show and uh you know because i i came on here i'm coming over here and you know i've  i've listened to your show a couple times i gotta be honest you're in the one of the most respectful 
[03:01:00]  buildings i've ever seen in my life i'm coming up to do the opiate ethy show there's like a marble  toilet here near you're in the economist building it's unbelievable we're still trying to get used  to it downstairs yeah we're right above steinway that's that's a little strange okay i said by the  way we brought up uh the sugar hill gang the other way the other day i told you about wonder mike it  was on mark's show that i did with him i told you i did a tv show with yeah and mike uh never mind the  buzzcocks oh my god buzzcocks what about that time you remember that time that dark weird time of my  life oh my god doing that show dude look at me you know what i do you know my point of view 
[03:01:30]  how bad was i hurting to do a fucking game show i mean you know what i mean i mean at what point  you know it's it's weird you go through these periods in your life where you're like what the  fuck am i gonna do man i'm fucking fifteen thousand dollars in debt where am i gonna go someone calls  up and go we're gonna do a game show with it's there's no money involved and there's improv and i'm  like oh shit all right okay do the game show it was completely unsuccessful they thought it was  because of the promotion but honestly i was so unhappy inside that i think that that came through i don't 
[03:02:00]  think i sold the game show quite right did you how did you feel about it i don't i did it once i had  a good time i mean i was out with coolio and terry nunn and wonder mike did something i don't remember  what it was i enjoyed it i mean i was happy you had me on i wasn't doing a lot of tv a couple  all right okay let me put it a different way you just did it once yeah i did like 14 of them maybe i'm  being too negative but i'll tell you something that's what i was going to get to about uh depression is  that i think a lot of you out there are probably taking medicine you don't need to be on here's why  the only difference in a lot of cases between disappointment and depression  is your level of commitment to people so just remember that it was like i just want to be 
[03:02:30]  happy you can't be happy all the time that that doesn't look different than retardation really  and you know except without the frustration not being able to fuck but none but nonetheless  am i saying am i saying am i saying you're a lot of safe no you're great now say whatever you want  as much as you want it's so weird it's like i feel like it's been building up we're doing a lot  of lessons building up we look we like when we get to just sit back and listen all right i'm sorry  let other people no i let other people do the heavy lifting regular regular radios rough  these days oh what i was gonna say i was whining because like i thought i was gonna come over 
[03:03:00]  here and start blowing off some steam about uh just about like the stuff that i don't talk about  on my show you know like regular stuff you know like jim norton stuff like the you know the classic  sort of uh the uh the crisis of life the perpetual masturbatory cycles of life and here i am doing it  dude i'm in a horrible depression because i had my my my dining room painted the wrong color  it's it's amazing what that will do is this a jim norton problem he that's just one of many  it's a jim norton problem oh dude he comes in every morning with a new problem it used to be his 
[03:03:30]  hookers had a cock and now it's his paint on now it's a problem if they don't give me those ribs  yeah yeah but it's fucking driving me it's driving me nuts that's hilarious what did you notice it when  you're like uh you know banging someone on the table no i knew it was done yesterday the right color  yeah i knew it yesterday when she was doing it and i was just you know whatever it's like a little  show like that that throws you a depression uh i gotta back up just a little bit supercross  guy uh blew us up not blew us off now he he didn't want to wait any longer he got mad who  what is supercross well tyler evans is uh the star of the star of supercross yeah we were getting 
[03:04:00]  back from break oh no sports dick habit was interesting so we uh went long with the guy  and then we were gonna come back from break and uh throw mark in that seat and supercross  guy in that seat and then see what happens right and just as we're coming back from uh break some  hot chick just pokes her head in the door and goes bye thank you bye thank you and left  with this attitude and walks out what did she expect you expect us to fucking boot  dick habit out so a guy who rides a bike can come in and chit chat well i'll get to you out of your  fucking mind i'll get to the bottom of this but uh tyler evans was uh scheduled for 8 a.m and he 
[03:04:30]  showed up late he showed up around 9 905 and uh and it was it was dick habit's turn what can i tell  you barely a real sport unless tyler evans uh was scheduled later and we had it wrong but i don't think  so even if he was look we would have had him in it would have been great to talk to the guy  but it's not like we're just sitting here the three of us it's dick habit we're not gonna boot a guy  who interviewed hendrix and the rolling stones a legend who's been on television he wrote for  fucking jack parr when i'm gonna ask you hey how did you pop the wheelie how high did you go 
[03:05:00]  fucking beat it with that whore yeah exactly and by the way dick habit's gonna be on my show  morning sedition tomorrow air america go ahead plug it we have replays all day we don't care i'm just  sitting here fascinated that i said the word banging jim martin i don't think i've ever used the word  banging so what happened with the supercross guide could someone tell me he just he just  luck yeah on that mic quickly look at i think he's climbing the building on his bike he wants to make  a grand entrance no right as we were getting coming back from commercial uh he was already out the door  and the girl came in she goes thanks for everything or something like that no no it wasn't thanks for 
[03:05:30]  everything we didn't do anything for them it was thanks goodbye she was annoyed yeah that was one of  those thanks that was supposed to go through something they taught you guys yeah right what  did you gain from doing it it would have been a ten minute interview hey new movie out looks kind of  cool we were at the x games great do you ride a bike on the highway all right thank you what did they  say to the video had a flight to catch had a flight to catch why were they late they could have been 
[03:06:00]  earlier they're on bikes they were scheduled for 8 a.m that's all i know let's say hi to theo in  virginia theo hey hey hey mark i went to i loved your book and i wanted to see if you had another  book maybe on the work uh you know that book took so much out of me you know it's good i i i am  working on something i've been offered an opportunity to write something i you know i think uh uh it's  starting to look like a more of a family oriented book but in terms of me dealing with my family but  i appreciate uh you liking the book and yeah i am working on what's the first book about uh jerusalem 
[03:06:30]  syndrome uh my life is a reluctant messiah was a book based on a one person show i did a few years  back uh off broadway here the basic premise of uh you know what jerusalem syndrome is it's this it's a  temporary psychological condition it happens to normal people when they go to israel not even  religious people they go to israel and they just snap and they think they're a biblical character  like moses or jesus or they think they're in direct communication with god and my the premise of  the book was not only did that happen to me in israel but i think i've had it all my life because 
[03:07:00]  i think i'm that special so uh so the issue is it's uh i go through my whole life in this kind of um  uh through this weird mystical self-indulgent grandiose narrative of me some sort of spiritual  church but it it goes in and out of like uh brand loyalty as being a sort of faith and commitment and  it goes through this whole drug period with uh kennison and hollywood at the comedy store that was the  best part of the book is i spent so much time creating this weird dark chapter when i was 21  years old and uh doing my graduate work in cocaine use uh at the comedy store and hearing voices in my 
[03:07:30]  head and it's interesting that when you coke yourself into a psychosis when you're actually  hearing voices in your head it's never one it's always many and if you're like me you spend a lot  of time trying to get them to pick a fucking leader you know if somebody's got something to say  step to the front of the head so uh so that was that book it's available i think for a for a buck  or two on amazon or you can get it to use there it's around with kennison i did hang with kennison 
[03:08:00]  sure yeah i did i was a doorman at the comedy store and uh is it haunted of course seriously we  ask that question to everyone that has played the comedy store well you know what i've always said is  that uh you know i believe it's an old gangster club just to you know i read i wrote this in the book  it's i believe it's actually built over one of the uh few existing gates to hell and that you know  the evil emanates up through the floors of the place and the comedians who are there the good  ones are able to to absorb it and make it funny so is it is it is it haunted no i think it's much  deeper than that i think it's uh it's uh it's on some sort of axis man i mean that place has such a 
[03:08:30]  a vacuum of darkness and such a freedom of mind it encourages a a a consciousness that is  uh man it is it is certainly just a creepy place when you go it's at the margins of funny it's not  only but when you live there you know i mean i lived in the house uh that she used to rent out  the comics i lived in dice's old room that was that was a funny moment is that i'm living up in  cresto in this little room and you never knew who the hell was going to come up there because the  place basically it becomes a party house for all the comics and a few of us lived up there i lived 
[03:09:00]  there schubert was living up there and uh a couple other people but uh you love schubert why hasn't he  been on our new show is he around i mean he doesn't come to philly sometimes but uh here's  me schubert and this guy named the todd todd lemish who eventually i think he went on to have an aneurysm  and moved to florida and cook or something but uh i remember one night of a dice came up he burst into  my room and i'm sleeping he's like do you ever get a blowjob in the tub you know and i'm like i don't  know do i have to wake up now you know but uh but it was the whole environment of the place 
[03:09:30]  she really let people run wild and i i do believe there is a dark energy but when you're in it  you know when you live in it you start to feed on it and that was like really the darkest most  weirdest period of my life besides you know i was fueled by drugs i remember leaving because the  drug dealer this is the weird thing the drug dealer came up to me i had a falling out with  kennis and i was freaking out in the parking lot and the guy who sold drugs he was this dude he was  an arab guy and he had fought in both uh he'd fought in the in the israeli the six-day war against 
[03:10:00]  the israelis and then he came here and the rumor was that he went to vietnam he was just this  mystical weird dark person he hooks at me and goes you gotta get out of here man and when the drug  dealer tells you to leave yeah you know it's time to go but yes i hung out with all those guys i  learned a lot about comedy it was really an amazing place to hang out for about a year but it got kind  of weird and it certainly is i think it's beyond haunted i think either you see anything ever like  what ghosts i don't know noises whatever uh yeah i i'd like to say i'd like to say that i did but 
[03:10:30]  once you get involved with that place i believe that i was one of the apparitions that you if you  feel like you belong in that place you start to be like i'm part of the store so you actually become  you're on some good drugs well you become one of the creepy things is that people come to the  comedy store and go that's that creepy guy you know he's a guy that works at the comedy store you  absorb the darkness and you become part of it so once you're part of it you're not allowed to say  it's haunted if you say it's haunted you really didn't become part of it all right how's that 
[03:11:00]  very good we got a excellent we got an update on tyler evans the supercross guy according to ben  tyler is going to reschedule he was out all night and fell asleep on the couch outside the studio okay  and he had to leave for a flight and he's on a bike and he's on a bike i'm sorry exactly say it twice  how did you uh get that gig over there air america well honestly what happened was i was out in la you  know i just bought a little house out there with my wife mishna wolf who's a who's a comic as well 
[03:11:30]  and i was working on something for a tv show for fox that they'd give me a deal to develop a show for  myself and that had gone south it wasn't going to happen and i'd heard this thing was starting up and  you know i had a complete deep uh contempt and resentment for this president and i saw this as an  opportunity to uh to be part of a momentum that would not you know help dethrone him and and elect  somebody else so i called up janine garofalo and i said who's in charge of this and she put me in 
[03:12:00]  charge in touch with liz winston i said look i want a shot at this i'd like to to be part of this effort  to you know it wasn't even to me it was sort of like can i help get rid of this guy that worked well  yeah right didn't quite work but uh but i think that it is it's an interesting uh to be part of  it now because it's evolved and there's an audience but that was originally what happened  and i got the gig i wanted to do the morning show because i wanted to try and compete in the market  which in retrospect i'm not sure was the greatest idea it's a hell of a hell of a time schedule  afternoon's rule i i bet i i couldn't agree with you more knowing now that uh what radio is but 
[03:12:30]  you know i do find it incredibly engaging the medium is completely new to me and i had to learn  how to do it and i feel fairly confident in it now and as you guys know it's it's a thrill man when  radio is going well and you're in it when you're in the zone it's the best feeling yeah and you can't  you can't fake it really well maybe you guys have been doing it longer can you fake it  things you do no passion anymore but yeah you fake it all right well that hasn't happened quite 
[03:13:00]  yet so that's that's how that came about oh it's pretty new yeah you break out old bits and things  yeah we know how to stretch things out they uh they tried to left radio for uh quite a quite a while  and just never really panned out what's different about um well what i'm doing now like our show is  is an interesting hybrid because once you said that we set the ideology of the show up in the  network there our show is doing all of the comedy you know most of the comedy on the network we've  got you know characters that we use we've got a lot of great guys who are writing bits and doing on 
[03:13:30]  air stuff we've we've uh infused a a sort of wide spectrum of guests like we're having cavit on we do  a lot of musical guests we're having michael mckean on this week so my show outside of the the rest of  the network is ideologically when we approach the news and when we talk about politics it is going to be  from a progressive viewpoint and i'm fairly irreverent a progressive viewpoint well you  know i'm in a red wedding it's going to be bed wedding well i i don't i don't know if that's  true i'm i'm a sort of reactionary sort of hyper conspiracy oriented person but the more i read 
[03:14:00]  the news but ideologically that's set but the comedy even in in and of itself and and the guests we have  in our show is uh it's it's pretty it's pretty edgy these guys are all you know good writers and i'm  willing to you know push it out to the edge and you know we aren't afraid to to uh offend some  liberals because you can't please all of them that's for sure so you know you have no qualms  about goofing on hillary or no no we do it a lot we used to do a thing called the liberal agenda  every day which was a fax that came from the streisand compound with liberal marching orders 
[03:14:30]  that just completely that's great you know and we've got a character on the show and this guy named  lawton smalls who represents planet bush and he's this completely strange conservative guy that just  toes the party line and at the end of every phone call just breaks down crying with some weird  musical story like he'll start singing musical comedies and you know the the comedy is what  drives me and also the idea that it is a voice that isn't represented whether it works as as well  or as big as as something that uh that happens here or in the standard sort of non-political show 
[03:15:00]  or even as well as right-wing shows is that what was happening originally is you had people out there  like in south carolina people out in the middle of nowhere who were calling us saying you know i can't talk  too loud because i don't want anyone to know i'm listening to you guys but thank god i thought it  was crazy so there's a lot of people out there that are relieved that the the the point of view and the  and the vocalization of how they're feeling is out there so on that level uh it is successful and you  know and numbers start to build when you start to have something like cindy sheehan out there when  people start to get sick of the war that seems to be going nowhere and people start to rally around 
[03:15:30]  a different point of view what do you think of her i like her a lot we've been talking to her every  morning have you yeah i think that she went out there she i think she was earnest i think she  wasn't going out there to politicize herself i think she's been sort of carrying this grudge and  this grief for a long time and what's happening around her i think for a lot of people is is  incredibly relieving and and and fascinating i don't think there has been any sort of vocalization  from the peace movement since 9-11 because people didn't know how to organize and this woman has 
[03:16:00]  some real grief and the people that are surrounding her also have some real grief and real criticism i think  that's given her some leeway i think a lot of people that would normally just bash the shit out  of her look and you kind of feel bad for her because of what happened i don't because her son being  killed yeah whether you're for the war against it whatever i i it's very hard to take a mother  who's lost a son and bash her exactly thank god so she's got that going for her but she comes off as a  little kooky well that's okay i mean i think she comes off as as very open and very uh there's a 
[03:16:30]  vulnerability to her i mean i think i i don't know if it's kooky as much as it is sort of like  she's she's pretty wide open i've noticed that in talking to her that you know you're you almost  feel like you're talking to a very you know a fragile vulnerable person she sounds a little  younger than she is but i think what's interesting is what you were saying it's galvanizing people  that have gut reactions and and real emotional problems with the war and there's so much galvanizing  people is just you people are still looking at our certain people like this fucking asshole but 
[03:17:00]  you're not vocalizing it as much as if it was you know it's celebrity again talking about the war  you could just jump on them and say fuck you you know that what you're saying or the country support  the troop uh it's very hard to then jump on this woman and bash her but i don't know what you  mentioned right but you mentioned i think you know palestine i got a little irritated like that's a  little the war here so you lose a son you say whatever you want right who am i to fucking tell  a mother not to grieve exactly that's exactly what i'm saying who am i to say how a mother should  grieve she wants to fucking stand outside bushes yeah but but then doesn't the question really come 
[03:17:30]  down to you know whether or not the question is is are the people who have died there the 1800 plus  people have died there what what is what are they dying for and what is the real question there  and if people are disconcerted about the war i think it is galvanizing because a lot of people in this  country who are liberals or even people that are conservatives that disagree are afraid to talk  because you know there are people that are so well fortified with bullshit talking points that will  jump down their throat and pummel them just just because they're like yeah yeah i won that one it's 
[03:18:00]  got nothing to do with real feelings of patriotism or real concern about the country there are people  that just like to pummel liberals because they find it entertaining and because they can you got  you got to say the liberals are also very very anxious to pummel the conservative i mean bush makes  a little verbal misstep and the times calls him a dummy whereas john kerry there was one word he  couldn't pronounce they would call it a verbal tick i mean i mean they pound back to him yeah but but  but okay but but that's you know i understand that and and i'm sure the pounding is mutual but i think 
[03:18:30]  that the the game is sort of tilted the other way and the organization of the pounding and the tone of  the media i am not one who believes that there is a a liberal media i mean i don't see it i think  there's an irresponsible media and there's a right-wing media and i think that's it i i believe  that to be true so if there is a pounding going on from the liberals good let them do it a little  bit let them try and get their their their words through it's just there is a wall of very organized  propaganda that is ready to just devour anybody and the fact that they can't devour cindy sheehan 
[03:19:00]  is is why it's galvanized no liberal media but you got to say like maybe not politically when you look  at something like the way hate crimes are reported in the media or the way like uh the way that guy nick  uh in bensonhurst is still in jail for what he did and the way it was front page news and then  when three black guys attack a jew it's page 17 they were yelling hey jew get out jew and it was  a brutal attack that is uh uh definitely a more of a liberal mentality than it is a conservative  mentality and that kind of permeates the media i don't know if it permeates the media in terms like 
[03:19:30]  i know that a lot of people criticize the media and like cnn and for these people not showing both  sides of the war but i really believe that if they were to really show both sides of the war it would  be much worse than what they're showing i mean the media feeds on on violence it feeds on stories  that are painful it feeds on you know a lot of things but i don't necessarily in a lot of ways  think that it is a political agenda i think it is an agenda of selling newspapers and or selling tv  shows i that's that's what i perceive how come the conservative media like fox isn't given the same 
[03:20:00]  uh even that same kind of asterisk like they're doing the same thing i mean fox is definitely  conservative slant and most people don't mind admitting that like yeah definitely yes more  rightly yeah and yet when you mention cnn or you mention some other uh media outlets people like  well i don't know it's the people are comfortable saying that it's and dan rath uh andy rudy was  even saying that dan rather was was was transparently liberal and he wasn't trashing him they're  friends he was saying yeah the media is liberal so what but you understand something though in the  70s and in the in the mid 80s all throughout most of what was the the great time of comedy 
[03:20:30]  right let's just use comedy as an example late 80s well it wasn't the late 80s really though i mean  the the great time of comedy was you know in the mid 70s and in the in the late 60s and all of the  comedy that came out in that time you know george carlin woody allen lenny bruce richard prior these  were all conversations is there was a liberal cultural conversation and that you know is where  somebody like dan rather started maybe he was biased but i don't think he really was and i'm saying  that the tables have turned in the cultural dialogue and there's no way to doubt that i mean even 
[03:21:00]  and culture uh you know tip that off to into the uh the right wing media and i don't think that the  cultural dialogue is at all liberal anymore and i think that if there is going to be a fight it is  on behalf of the liberals to try and be heard and that there is no fair sort of uh balance here back  then the liberals to me i was talking to some guy he was one of abby hoffman's guys he was actually  the comedy seller on so his name was stew something i have a photo with him real like  photographer don't know i don't know we talk i mean like they say the people on the left  no he's like a legendary left-wing guy real radical guy in the 60s and even he what i was talking about 
[03:21:30]  was that it's not necessarily liberal agenda that bothers people so much or bothers me personally  like you know guys like what but prior was talking about which was anti-establishment or lenny bruce  who was going anti-establishment lenny bruce was completely against censorship absolutely but it  seems like the left has become so self-righteous and so willing to restrict freedoms and speech as far  as his content that's the problem i have with them is they become so uh knee-jerk reactionary and so  willing to restrict what you can say here's the issue what's what's what's what's correct and  what's not correct so willing to think for other people i hear that where's that freedom that they 
[03:22:00]  were fighting for in the 60s that's what differentiates them to me well you want to know  where that broke down and i and i've noticed this because i am a comic and i'm certainly willing to  be politically incorrect and i certainly don't believe in censorship but what happens with the  liberals outside of liberal intellectuals is that the diversity of the the liberal tent the idea that  progressives and liberals uh can all exist together is difficult because each one of them  there are all these different salon there's boutique causes is what i call them and it's not the 
[03:22:30]  democratic party it's the idea of liberalism is that you know the liberal principles politically or you  know our health care you know abortion rights uh you know peace you know environmental issues but  progressive issues can range anywhere from like you know how come you're not talking about darfur how  come you're not paying more attention to women's rights what about the fish where do the cats fit  into this why why why do we need to you know i think vegetables have feelings too i mean that you know  you have a fairly broad spectrum of people that are trying to exist under one tent and there's no way to 
[03:23:00]  do that so out of that strange respect for each other or trying to respect everybody's agenda you get  this strange censorship which i think is completely detrimental to the cause and i believe that you know if  you can't have a sense of humor about some things you're really in trouble but is it is it born out  of a respect for each other or or a paternalistic self-righteousness like i find a lot of it and  again i know you're a comic it's it's like but a lot of it is born out of to me a paternalism like  blacks are held to a different set of standards uh uh uh than whites are and i've you know again with 
[03:23:30]  i use comedy central as an example because that's just my point of reference but literally the things  they would come to say to us about what we couldn't make fun of like i mean colin were doing a sketch  one time where he was like you know hitting me and it was a domestic violence reference where he and i were  married the guy no no no domestic violence jokes no you can't do that violence is okay to make fun of  but not domestic violence uh you can make fun of the church you know you can that's fine but you  can't say fag it's like there was just such uh liberal ideology which permeated every note  yeah but wait now making fun of the church and making fun of domestic uh violence now 
[03:24:00]  no violence and domestic violence a breakdown violence you can make fun of violence sure but you  can't make fun of murder absolutely okay you can make fun of you can't make fun of the church but  you can make fun of the church but you can't say fag meanwhile i should even say fag that's a  language thing but like say like you can attack uh a certain priest but you or you couldn't attack  uh a certain ideology of the left too high i'm telling you that's what they would come to say  to us well i mean is it is it an issue of balance or is it an issue that you think that it's liberal  the thing is is once you open the doors and start mocking people you're going to hurt people's 
[03:24:30]  feelings people are going to react and you know unless the joke has some sort of intention  other than hurting somebody's feelings if it is elevating the dialogue a little bit about why  you know political correctness is is detrimental sorry fellas uh you know then i uh you know i don't  know if they're wrong but i don't know if that's liberalism really i think it's just about programming  all the notes they gave us though i would agree with you if the notes were balanced um but the notes  weren't balanced they all came from one particular ideology and i got into it with the lady from 
[03:25:00]  practices and standards about i'm like like on chapelle's show they could say nigger but on  tough crowd they couldn't say nigger now that you couldn't say that absolutely shouldn't be  colin couldn't say it in a sketch where it was where he was mocking these hollywood assholes who  try to assimilate into a thug culture uh wait they wouldn't even let black people say no on the  show on the tone of the show uh and when colin wanted to say it was unacceptable yet when that when  they when the news anchor said it on chapelle's show which was brilliantly funny uh that that that  particular sketch he he was allowed to say it you know it was a very pick and choose and they 
[03:25:30]  always seem to pick and choose on that one ideology i guess so i but i don't think it's sometimes i  don't think it's like a uh an instituted ideology it sounds like the people that were at comedy  central making certain programming decisions because they were uncomfortable it's not something  i don't think that there's some sort of manifesto i think no no no you know and i don't think there  is instituted the political correctness that is instituted you know i do have problems with  because i do think that it shuts some people out and i do think that it mischaracterizes  uh some elements of history and i do think it is censoring because i have noticed myself and the 
[03:26:00]  great thing about lenny bruce or about uh you know some of the stuff that you do or i would do  is that a lot of people do not want to honor that political correctness they're dying to be released  from it they're dying to be able to laugh at themselves and realize that they're taking things  much too seriously so in that sense i don't know if it's an instituted paternalistic self-righteousness  but i do think there is some individual self-righteousness uh in liberals i do think that there is a  sort of like you know you can never uh resolve the problems or know as much as i do i think there's 
[03:26:30]  some of that on an individual level uh because i think those are control issues but i don't notice  it that much on uh on an institutional level and what you're saying is that it is a comedy central  what what just i and again i can only comment on what i've dealt with you know i mean it's easy to  just go out of the media i mean that was an experience i had it was just the guy in charge though  we get that all the time it's very weird but it seemed to come down think about who's in charge over  there but even before doug got there like doug herzog's in charge now you know supposedly he's  liberal i don't really know him that well uh but before doug even i mean this is because standards 
[03:27:00]  and practices this seems like liberals were just uh running comedy central for for a while there  and they seem to run most and then their personal you know feelings get involved which is the worst  thing you could do in comedy obviously because comedy central especially supposed to be like and  again like you know come on it's comedy century you're supposed to take shots at everybody but it's  worth thinking just that the by virtue of the freedom that you want you know by virtue of what  you're protecting and your ability to do comedy and there's certain elements of what you do that  you know you got to admit is at the very least liberal if not fucking out there you know i mean 
[03:27:30]  this is a very specific issue with you it's about language and about political correctness right but  i mean there are certain freedoms that you enjoy and certain things that you would fight for that  can definitely be considered without it without a doubt and believe me i say that i i and i and people  get annoyed when i put the asterisk but i'm never toting the religious right i mean they're the greatest  uh... as far as uh... censorship and no one is saying that i mean that to me they're more  dangerous political correctness is an irritant i mean it's a piece of sand in your eye but you know  to me the the religious right what they've done to shut people down verbally is dangerous i think some 
[03:28:00]  political correctness is what's good what kills the liberal movement in general what kills the  progressive movement in general is because there is this weird honoring of so many different uh...  uh... different points of view and different types of agendas that there's no way to ever get any  momentum going as as a group i mean uh... a lot of right wing and conservative are pretty much under  the same banner they're all it's amazing yeah they can mobilize it's easy when that when that when  they when it's when you're narrow-minded you know to uh... to all be on the same page i think that's why  uh... sure i think that's why uh... right wing radio you know has done much better than uh... the left uh... 
[03:28:30]  over the years yeah because for some reason right wing uh... whining uh... is more satisfying  in in in terms of uh... of uh... placating people's anger and making them get hard get that weird  anger hard now you would say they would say the same thing they would say the same thing you go  who's whining where you know no no but they it doesn't come off as whining it just comes out as  bile you know when they do it there's a you know when when when a liberal when a person think about what 
[03:29:00]  you're complaining about you know when when a liberal is complaining about their or not complaining  or speaking about their their rights are being denied justice you know there there's no way that's an  individual saying you know i want you know i want someone to help me you know whereas you know most of  the time the right is like fuck that guy now what's really more satisfying i want someone to help me or  fuck that guy i like the fuck that exactly so that's why there's a difference but it is still whining it's  just masked in a sort of contempt but the israel and where the left loses a lot of people with certain 
[03:29:30]  like uh again old school guys are different like you know his his uh uh mentor brother we's a radio  guy who's an older liberal guy fought nom he's sitting on it yeah he's one of those guys old  school guys and we're yet nom i swear to god or nom nom the club you never heard it who's having fun  if you ask brother we see one of the reasons he re-upped was because he was having a really good time 
[03:30:00]  over there there are a lot of those guys you ever see you know duval and apocalypse you know  beach party like a blast certainly did you know but we were talking about like uh you know he's  very anti-government he's anti-war anti-bush right hates him um and then i'm like well how do you feel  about you know like when it comes to racial profiling middle eastern guys he's like well you know you  can't win a ball like you're basically going jesus you know there definitely is a point to that  like not so married to the party line um which is what's frustrating sometimes in the left when you say  all right well how about profiling guys you know you're not a lot a lot of guys that you speak to 
[03:30:30]  from the left and the right too they they can't take anything out of the party line and and sometimes  you want to smack and go look i know you well enough to know you don't believe that you believe this way  but you're not saying it because it goes against the party line that's the biggest problem there's no  right well that goes that's the interesting thing about conservatives as well is that you get these  guys that may not know what they really feel but they get a certain amount of talking points in  place and they know they can win an argument but most of the people we talked to on our show like 
[03:31:00]  we have discussions about that like after uh the bomb in england those bombs in england went off and  and the uh the movement to start searching people here and to profile we have discussions about that  there are plenty of liberals that are you know that that are scared and and want solutions and want  to feel safe in this country the real question around that stuff is does it work it doesn't make it  safe how long does it you know go on for do you really trust them to uh to to be responsible  around taking care of this problem was it just a publicity thing we have conversations about this 
[03:31:30]  and i know very few uh few liberals and very few people uh who we have talked to on the phones or even  my partner where you there isn't a discussion to be had we got people calling like a lot of people  again a knee-jerk reaction profiling bad you know and in a utopian society it is bad you'd rather not have it  but the question is do you honestly or anybody honestly feel as great a threat  uh of being murdered in public or blown up by say three middle-aged women you know you go racially  one black one white one asian or three middle eastern men who do you feel more of a threat from 
[03:32:00]  i'll be the first to tell you i mean look you know i live in queens you know i uh you know i have a few  pakistanic guys who have been across the hall from me you know i you know i you know i i'm nice you  know i reach out you know and i don't uh generally suspect them of anything i say things you know i try to be  friendly like hey that music's interesting what's that smell is that food you know but but the worst  food that they cook but i love indian food i mean that's a weird thing about me it's like up the 
[03:32:30]  hallways though oh come on you gotta love it i went to a cab driver this is the saddest thing about me  is i had an indian cab driver said i want to go to india and he goes why and the only thing i could come  up with is like you got that good bread that's a nice all right but anyways well what i'm saying is  that i am a victim of that fear i know where that fear comes from the fear of judgment but do the  numbers line up does profiling really work or are there bigger issues are there port security  issues are there airport security issues are there other issues on a policing level on an intelligence  level that need to be put into place before you start just you know throwing guys who are arab 
[03:33:00]  against the wall and searching them on the train but yes yeah you're i i agree with you all should  be like the stuff you just said is completely correct all the the uh the ports the all that stuff  has to be done better but i don't believe again throwing people against the wall no nobody wants to  see that no one wants to see it done without any kind of respect or dignity i mean you don't want  it to be done where innocent citizens are being subjected to humiliating experiences i think there's  a way to do it it's not but like you said it's not old ladies and it's not a middle eastern guy that's 
[03:33:30]  you know has nothing more than his wallet on him and a light breezy coat i mean if you see some if you  see someone that fits the bill we know what the bill is here that's another thing where i'm saying stop let's  not get uh these party lines and party ideology in the way of common fucking sense oh but what do  you do anthony all right if you see somebody you do you search him but but who who but like i was  on the train this happened twice this happened twice to me twice to me and it might have happened  to you i don't know absolutely i'm on the train in queens i'm sitting there right i across from a guy 
[03:34:00]  he's praying out loud he's a muslim he's working his prayer beads he's got a bag so now i'm sitting  there i'm fucked i'm i'm gonna blow up all right now the odds of that happening are really small  they really are okay they just aren't even in the muslim world they're small all right granted that  some of the people that have done these things are muslim all right so i'm sitting there some yes  yes some majority well there's the three terrorist acts that have happened in this country you know  one was an american two were muslim yes i get it well you know let's go uh you're correct but bosnia 
[03:34:30]  let's let's go with numbers though let's let's let's let's pile a body count up and you might  want to say it was four actual errors in that day or not just one no no i get it okay no i was talking  about the the nice lumping all of 911 together the 95 and then the the oklahoma and let's go with the  year streak that they're on you know i don't think what i'm saying is i'm scared but the truth of the  matter is is as scared as i was you know when you have people if if i can just say look we need to  stop the train if you're going to trust me it's like when they pulled those guys off of that bus down 
[03:35:00]  by times square because someone at gray line says i got a bad feeling you can't fucking have that you  can't have you being able to say you know just because you're downstairs in the lobby you can't  call the cops and go hey i just got a bad feeling about this guy and have them come and rip someone's  car up or or or throw them down how the hell are you going to how the hell are you going to structure  this you're right but on 9-11 they did have two of those guys stop the security for a reason there  was something about two of those guys that they were uncomfortable with and they did have them stop the  security and they let them through and when richard reed uh was boarding uh american airlines in i 
[03:35:30]  think it was a paris flight where he tried to shoot well i mean again that's not america but the agent  said there was something about him i was uncomfortable he bought the one-way ticket i just but again  there's this there's this feeling that i can't embarrass somebody but who do you trust i mean like it's  like that bit i used to do about being searched at the airport and this is the truth of the matter is  is that the reason we let them search us is that it's a democratic thing to do we allow them to  so the people they are racially profiling don't get uncomfortable absolutely all right all right so  so given that and that's a reality with any search situation but my fear is is that you know by and 
[03:36:00]  large racial profiling is not that effective it just it isn't how could it not be effective when  you're profiling the very people that are doing because most people don't do it and what happens  is is you get people that are living in fear you get people it engages in a type of of of contempt  and suspicion that may not necessarily be true in most cases if you're going to profile someone  ninety nine percent of the time it ain't the guy so if you're going to do it a hundred percent of  the time and create a world full of fear distrust and deny people civil liberties for ninety nine 
[03:36:30]  percent of the time being wrong it to change a culture like that and live like that it's not a  democracy it's not freedom it doesn't have to go from searching guys that fit the bill to internment  camps it's not i'm not talking about internment right well i'm talking a lot of people with kind  of do that uh... slippery slope thing but who's going to well i'm going to trust who are you going to  trust to to to make these decisions what is uncomfortable me i trust that i trust the people  that are putting somebody that he thinks might be a problem and again as long as he's respectful 
[03:37:00]  i trust his instinct more than i trust stupid bloomberg going now we're not going to look at  anybody any differently and having a seven-year-old woman search while two middle eastern guys will walk  on to the idea of that is is they don't have the money that you first of all it's going to cost two  million dollars a day in overtime just to get those guys to actually search people even if they search  just arabs all right so the other thing is is it was a publicity campaign just to make people nervous  to make people feel safer and the people that they that the people that want to do this if they are  out there whether they're they're going to be on the train that you think they give a fuck you think 
[03:37:30]  they're not going to figure out another way to do it does the left and the aclu and everyone else  have any options any other idea where they're constantly criticizing anything anyone in power  wants to do to try to protect the transportation system the american people but i never once hear  a solution of something that might make us safer well i tell you i mean what we've been talking about  video cameras i there's some people that aren't uncomfortable with video cameras they seem to be 
[03:38:00]  effective in some ways aclu is against them yeah i know well the aclu that the reason that the aclu  you know makes a stand and should make a stand and always should make the stand that they have  is to provide debate around issues that could cause a slippery slope towards denying people  civil liberties for many years to come in in taken out of context if laws are changed and the  constitution has changed who the hell's to say it's arabs today but tomorrow it's chronic masturbators  who the hell's to say that if chronic masturbators are a threat to uh who decides that who decided 
[03:38:30]  you know what i i think it's really decided by the public no it's not i think being blown up in a  train is dangerous but that's right and i think everyone would agree with there's a lot of people  that think gay marriage is dangerous that masturbating yeah but there's enough people to balance it out  you're not going to find people that go i think blowing up trains is great that's true you're not  you're not anybody you're not this country is based on the balances but if you change laws and the  gay marriage thing yeah there are plenty of people against it but there's plenty of people for it  that keep it balanced where you're not really gonna but i think everybody including the civil libertarians 
[03:39:00]  want this society to be safe they want police i don't think so no i don't think i think that's wrong  they're willing to sacrifice that just to make a self-righteous stand on a principle even if they know  it's a constitutional principle it's a constitutional principle it's not a self-righteous principle  what they're trying to do is protect the future of democracy on a constitutional level  one of the senators said after 9-11 the constitution is not a suicide pact  we've never he we've never in this country to my knowledge had at least with technology the way  it is a group infiltrating and and behaving as citizens and working among us as citizens 
[03:39:30]  for the sole purpose of murdering us uh whereas we japanese internment can't terrible because these  were not these citizens have done nothing wrong right this is a situation where they're they're using  this but let me to to assimilate into society to get people comfortable where they can comfortably  move about and then commit a murder like on the three thousand person wait wait but i i believe as i said  before that the the aclu and civil liberties union are fighting for constitutional ideas in order to  protect us in the future now i think that most of the legislation that's going to go on around this 
[03:40:00]  not unlike england that if some of this stuff is done on a law enforcement level and these things are  done and people are are doing their jobs investigating and making intelligence communities communicate  if the fbi and cia are communicating with the uh with the uh ml5 and in and these things start to  work in a way that isn't competitive that we might have a shot at this as people as people in the  world that live in in fear if intelligence communities and law enforcement communities  communicate with each other and create a technology that would make their job be more effective that 
[03:40:30]  isn't completely intrusive i think there is a middle way but mark i agree with you but what is that  technology when the aclu fights cameras being in the street when you have okay technology that makes  it easy cameras in the street that's infringing i don't think anyone's fighting uh cameras in the  train the civil libertarians would fight a complaint they wanted they complained about cameras possibly  being from the cockpit into the plane they said that was an invasion of privacy where pilots could  look uh on a monitor and see what was going on in the back of the plane but like anthony said 
[03:41:00]  like anthony said the the the people will rule on this and the people will find a medium way if you  don't have this kind of active debate the reason the aclu exists is to try to protect the  constitution of the united states and try to protect the civil rights of individual citizens  and like i said administrations change the tone of culture changes you can't put all you know you  can't change these documents that are meant to protect our way of life you know just to honor  what's going on now because apparently they can with the second amendment yeah that's something hey you 
[03:41:30]  know back then i love when they bring that up back then you know they needed the militia you needed  your weapons for food and things like that back up but times now if the uh forefathers knew what  times would be like now and the weapons we'd have now they never would have this blah blah blah and  then when it comes down to the situation that we're in with terrorism and the rights of of people and  and uh searches and stuff then it's hey it's written in stone back in the old days it's not based on  what's happening now it's just hypocrisy on behalf of the aclu in this particular case and and the left 
[03:42:00]  well i i don't think you can lump all the left together there are plenty of people that are you  know consider themselves progressives that consider themselves liberals that that own guns that believe  in safety that believe in in a lot of things that are constitutional that that is one of the issues  within the left that is not set in stone and i think characterizing the left it's a lot easier to  characterize the right and the religious right as having specific specific ideals but the interesting  thing about the left is that you've got uh you know plenty of people that are progressive yet believe in 
[03:42:30]  some of the same things that you're talking about we got that two minutes left that the computer cut  us off that's that's the i'm good i'm good that's all right you mark is battling i love this hanging in  there will the left and right ever get along yeah yeah that we do meet on certain areas yeah yeah al  goldstein was once considered the left yeah you know we pull trains together if a guy's banging a girl  once you want to blow me i don't care who he voted for there you go i'll high five her over her half past
