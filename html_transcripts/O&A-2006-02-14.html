<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a detailed account of a prank the hosts orchestrated outside their studio.  They placed several items – a "Teen Lust" porn DVD, a "Guys Gone Wild" (male version) DVD, a "Black Tail" magazine, a large dildo ("Mighty Kong"), and a "Bat Boy Lives" t-shirt – on the sidewalk and observed passersby's reactions.  The reactions ranged from swift theft to indifference, with a janitor notably sweeping away and destroying some of the items, prompting the hosts to use a bullhorn to heckle him.  The hosts' commentary was filled with vulgar and sexually explicit jokes, often targeting gay pornography and people with intellectual disabilities. They debated the legality of their actions, discussing potential littering charges and consulting a lawyer over the phone.  The segment ended with planning for a potential sequel to the prank.  Commercial breaks occurred throughout the broadcast.


The legal ramifications of the prank, specifically involving the janitor ("Mop Guy"), were then extensively discussed.  The hosts detailed past arrests of show personnel, including producer Rick, Jimmy Norton, Louis Black, and Psycho Mark, and their experiences in jail.  A caller raised the concern of potential charges related to corrupting a minor due to the placement of pornography in a public space.  The hosts brainstormed retaliatory pranks against "Mop Guy," ranging from harmless to aggressive actions.  This discussion segued into a comedic bit involving a graphic description of a scene from a book detailing Rocky Balboa's supposed fetish for watching women defecate on a glass table, which prompted further crude jokes and sexual innuendo.  The segment concluded with the announcement of a staff contest for leftover PlayStation Portables (PSPs), leading to a debate on how to fairly distribute them, ultimately settling on an Icy Hot challenge on the testicles.  An intern served as a test subject to gauge the pain level.


The Icy Hot challenge, involving Danny, Nathaniel, and Eric (with Travis initially participating but quitting early), became the focus of the next segment.  The hosts described the contestants' reactions with graphic detail and explicit language.  The challenge involved repeated Icy Hot applications to the scrotum, interspersed with increasingly strenuous exercises like squats and jumping jacks to intensify the pain.  The segment included commercial breaks, NASCAR news with Jimmy Johnson, and XM radio advertisements, including a parody of "Everybody Loves Raymond." A caller commented on the shift in the show's content from featuring women to "faggots in their undershorts." The exact winners of the PSPs weren't explicitly stated.


The Icy Hot challenge continued, with the addition of increasingly ridiculous methods to enhance the pain, such as Tiger Bomb and Tabasco sauce, suggested by both hosts and callers.  Travis and then Danny quit, leaving Eric and Nathaniel.  The challenge ended with Steve, a staff member, giving both remaining contestants wedgies, resulting in Eric's underwear breaking.  Eric won the PSP. The aftermath focused on the contestants’ pain and cleaning the Icy Hot from their bodies.  A call from "Jackie," who described a sexual fetish involving knives being dragged across her body, led to her and her roommate/fiancé Rob being brought on air.  Jackie described her fetish in detail while Rob, on the air, used knives on her body as the hosts provided commentary.  The segment included numerous XM Satellite Radio plugs, including one for Dale Earnhardt Jr., a Small Business Minute, a Jim Norton stand-up announcement, and an Esquire Minute.  There was also a brief discussion of Valentine's Day history.


The final segment included a phone call with Kevin Smith, who discussed a potential Fletch reboot without Chevy Chase, Jay Mohr as a possible replacement, and anecdotes about Mohr's stand-up shows and Opie and Anthony fans.  Smith also mentioned his "stink bomb" and its effect on fans.  Following the call, the show returned to "Jackie the Knife Girl," with Rob continuing to use knives on her body on air while the hosts provided sexually suggestive commentary.  The show concluded with short advertisements.

[00:08:30]  and we found five items five items that we don't want anymore or never wanted i should say because  now i'm looking at this list yeah um we have these five items teen lust dvd of fine porn that's porno  now why wouldn't we want that we have about 20 copies i know everyone took one home there you go  there's a couple left over then we have the guys gone wild dvd see this is a great idea it's just 
[00:09:00]  like girls gone wild all right only it's guys only it has lots and lots of what money making potential  they take the dicks out and start swinging them around yeah college guys are kissing each other  yeah that's gonna sell so who came up with that idea just because like chicks college girls making  out and showing their tits sells like fucking gangbusters uh yeah we'll just do it the other  way with guys you know it's just gay men buying this uh i got a great idea but no one will take my 
[00:09:30]  phone calls yet uh-oh tards gone wild  tards gone wild tards now i i guess this would feature uh retarded people just doing what they do  best and what would they be doing just do what they do best just like but they're always going wild  what they are really truly just like like walking and throwing a fit yeah pitch this to us 
[00:10:00]  well one of my dreams is what is it one of my dreams is to see tards have sex  it's one of my wacky dreams and it doesn't work when it's actors playing retards no no like the  other sister it's gotta be the real thing when it was uh yeah i just want to see tards having like  monkey sex retards having sex in the movies no real retard boy yeah i have never seen  a retarded porno retard porn is that illegal would be a market for it i don't know some 
[00:10:30]  exploitation thing i bet you did we find a layer of age did we find a loophole in the  in the porn industry get it why don't you call the police station right now and just ask that  question just to hear the office listen i'm gonna shoot a video um to have two retarded people have  sex they're both consenting they're both over 18 we're about ready to videotape this we're just  wondering the set's here everything's done they've stopped drooling for the time being we really want  to shoot this thing where's uh steve steve would know uh steve c would know he is the porno expert 
[00:11:00]  we'll find everything about pornography so anyway uh just to get back to this as we get steve we got  these five items the teen lust dvd we have the guys gone wild dvd that we got off jim norton's desk by  though i hear steve here the retard with the fluffer in the background yeah don't do that yet  we're still trying to get clearance steve what do you know on tarred porno i don't i know that there 
[00:11:30]  have been titles that have been made that advertise themselves as being retard porn but i'm trying to  determine whether or not they're real i personally don't think they're real now if you just get like  mental disorder porno people could fake it yeah you need what we're talking about really here  swollen tongue is porno is down syndrome pornography the good old ds i think there would be an issue  with the the consent because you know you could always argue consent for some you know that you  didn't get it from somebody who wasn't necessarily all there mentally here's what i believe just kind 
[00:12:00]  of running it through my head for a very short time i think people with down syndrome obviously uh  many of them have to live with their parents for their entire lives sure so you can't like just  approach them and you know get them away and get them on a set to do porno so we need to draft up  some sort of permission slip right it's got to be a permission slip that the parents can sign unless  you could infiltrate one of those assisted living communities and then you know there you go now  there we need some maybe that are a little more handy capable as i say steve you came up with that a

[00:36:30]  would you  as a sane human being  pick up a huge dildo that's laying there  no  i think a trap door would open  and be slid into some gay slavery  at least it's still in the packaging  now if it was just out there like it was like  disposable  which we may have to do  all right here's another gentleman giving it a look  he's looking at all three items  that's what new york's all about isn't it  all right a black lady just stepped on black tail  all right now this black couple  all right  walking by  oh she just stepped on  oh that's hilarious

[00:44:30]  ?  ?  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  During the break, the Black Tail magazine also went, Anthony.  Yeah.  All five items are now gone in the hands of some fine New Yorkers.  Someone grabbed it up. 
[00:45:00]  I love that new bit.  And one angry janitor.  Oh, man, the janitor was great.  First time we've tried that bit, and now we'll hone it and make it ours.  Mold it.  We'll mold it.  Yeah.  It was funny.  The guy thought he was, like, showing us by jumping up and down on the Teen Lust DVD.  I hope we have a video of that because his anger is just amazing.  I just like when he just grabs his fucking dick.  Yeah, he grabs his dick through his pants and, like, hey. 
[00:45:30]  When was that insulting?  Like, when that guy came of age, like, in, like, the late 50s.  Yeah.  He was sick.  I was going to say he's singing doo-wop songs with, like, a fire in the fucking...  Grabs his cock.  Take that, daddy-o!  Blue moon.  He's, like, slicking his hair back with his comb.  He was just really pissed because...  Nah, nah, I plan on being a race car driver, and then I'm going to retire by the time I'm 30. 
[00:46:00]  Mop the floor.  He was just pissed because he really wanted that Bat Boy Lives t-shirt, and we called him out on it.  And then he couldn't take it.  And he's like, fuck!  Yeah, that's right.  He was taking that in.  Yep.  He was taking it.  He was going to keep it.  He was gone.  He was one step in the building, basically, and then Anthony heckled him, and then he had to do something.  Now that he was mad, he couldn't look like a guy that wanted a Bat Boy shirt off a sidewalk, so he ripped it in front of us.  And grabbed his dick.  And grabbed his dick.  The big Laverne and Shirley, you put your thumb under your front tooth, whatever the fuck that means. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, you take your thumbnail and kind of flick it underneath your front tooth upper teeth.  That might have been Carmine from Laverne and Shirley.  Carmine Ragusa, the big ragu.  That was the big ragu.  That was the big ragu.  All right, we're going to have to come up with some other items next time.  And I don't want to wait.  I think we should do this bit next week.  Fucking Fonzie.  That's what happened to the Fonz.  He used to be cool turning on fucking jukeboxes by hitting them, and now he's mopping, sweeping the sidewalk. 
[00:47:00]  Too old for the Pulaski twins.  Yo.  Let's go to Big Dick McGee.  Big Dick.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  What up, bro?  Just wanted to tell you, that's the best thing y'all have done since you have been on Exxon.  Look at that.  That janitor, the funniest shit I have ever heard.  People like it.  I see him becoming a recurring character, janitor guy, anytime you want to yell out the window to him.  Yeah, definitely.  Not as friendly as like when Letterman would do that thing where, you know, he'd look out 
[00:47:30]  his window and make a phone call or something.  He's always very cordial.  We want people to just start shooting.  Like, this guy's going to one day just fire rounds up at us.  Yeah, let's see how mad we can make him.  You need a spotter at the window.  Yeah.  Dude, he's mopping the sidewalk, and then you just run with the bullhorns.  That was great.  What do you say every morning?  I say next time he comes out, well, tomorrow, we just shoot him with water guns.  Super soaker will make it across the street.  Throw a self-help book at him. 
[00:48:00]  Water balloons from the fifth floor.  Or how about we get, you know, I've watched Jackass many a time, and I know there are people  that can vomit on cue just to vomit in front of his place, so he's got to go out there  and mop up puke.  Oh, wow.  Just get people to puke.  The ideas are endless.  Oh, that poor bastard.  I'm already feeling bad for him.  See?  What happened to me?  That was great.  And then the black lady with the giant white dildo.  That was very, very funny, too.  She picked it up. 
[00:48:30]  No qualms.  We got video.  I don't know.  How long does the video take?  Later today, probably?  Tonight?  Early tonight.  All right.  Later on today, you'll see the video of what we just did.  Yeah.  Up on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com.  Jinx in New Jersey, what's up?  Hey, me?  Yeah, what's up, Jinx?  I was just listening to Howard because I don't have XM in my car.  Bastard.  And he said that he invented best ofs.  Really?  Yeah, he said nobody did best ofs before me. 
[00:49:00]  I had to save my tape so people could do best ofs.  It's called reruns.  I would love to abuse Howard, but there's a commercial for one of my serials.  Go lean.  On TV right now.  Go lean.  Yeah, it looked like a Kotex commercial.  Right.  All right.  Well, he invented best ofs.  That is good.  What about the...  I'm looking forward to the master list of all the things he invented, so we all know. 
[00:49:30]  What about the rerun?  What about, like, reruns?  That's...  Those are best ofs.  That's what they do.  Ah.  That guy is amazing.  Have fun, Howie.  Have fun.  How about you do a radio show?  Mm-hmm.  Let's say hi to Sean in Staten Island.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning to you, Sean.  I just must say that was so fucking hilarious, especially when Bill Burr yelled to the janitor,  yo, did his keys open the door to your dreams?  I almost...  I fell over. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, that was a great block, man.  The bullhorn was a nice touch to the bit, I must say.  All right.  Thank you, Sean.  Look at us just patting ourselves on the back.  Well done.  Well done.  Well done.  Good job.  Good job, sir.  We got cops?  What, the cops?  Wait, Mars, get over here.  I don't know.  I just seen them.  I'm going to go out there and check now.  We have cops?  Lock the doors.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we have cops?  We didn't do anything.  There's no problem.  We've been in here doing the weather all day. 
[00:50:30]  We're a broadcast facility.  We were broadcasting.  Let's say hi to Steve in New Hampshire.  Steve.  Hey, yeah.  You guys are trying to figure out what a quarter acre is?  Yeah.  It's 104 feet by 104 feet.  104 feet by 104 feet.  That's like tiny.  He bought a studio.  All right.  Mars, what's going on?  I guess the cops are inquiring about what happened earlier this morning.  Nothing happened.  Exactly.  Yeah.  What do they want to know?  I don't know.  Destroy that video.  Destroy the video.  What video?  Yeah, there's no video. 
[00:51:00]  Here we go.  Yeah, there's nothing.  Omerta.  Why is everyone hiding?  Omerta.  Omerta.  Remember.  You say nothing.  You guys, we're working on the rules where the interns and stuff have to throw themselves  in front of us so they can take the hit.  Why is Poe laughing?  Why is Mars in the studio?  The guy across the street called the cops.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  What, the janitor?  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  What a baby.  Call the police.  Are you kidding?  I knew it.  Where are they?  Try to tell them you took it too far.  They're gone?  Yeah, we can't do that again.  Can't do what?  Yeah.  What happened?  What can't we do?  That guy called the cops.  It's supposedly illegal to do that on the street.  To do what?  To do what?  Yeah.  Putting the stuff on the street and then yelling at people?  Can't do that.  What?  What stuff?  Oh, we'll do it again.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  We'll do it again.  Remember, now if this ever happens, let's make a contingency plan here.  Yes.  Has everyone seen Superman 2? 
[00:52:00]  Remember where they break out of the three criminals from Krypton break out of the glass  thing and they go to the White House and ask who the president is and the guy stands  up and he kneels before Zod.  Kneel before Zod.  And it's not the real president.  You getting my drift here?  I got it.  This is what we need to do.  Before any cops really get through those doors, if it really looks serious, a couple  of you guys are going to have to be Opie and Anthony. 
[00:52:30]  Shouldn't we be having to...  I'm sorry.  Two of you guys are going to have to sit by the mics and just take the hit.  Hey, I found my match.  Who?  Bill Burr.  Close enough.  Bill Burr is going to do it.  We'll need a Bill Burr, too.  Close enough.  You can't throw Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.  He's not sacrificial.  He'll be the Opie stand-in.  I'm talking...  Just because you looked the part a little bit.  I bet.  More than anyone else around here.  Will Bill be my stand-in?  What?  Bill the intern?  Yeah, and Bill the intern.  Bill the intern can be me.  Right.  Which will be crazy.  I'll have, like, warrants out for me for murder in the jail cell. 
[00:53:00]  Anthony Comey escaped today after killing five people in the jail cell.  When they brought you in, you confessed to, like, seven other crimes.  You'd find all kinds of drugs on them.  What do you mean you can't yell at people on a sidewalk?  I think another thing is...  Well, thank God they didn't see the thing that wasn't there.  The thing that wasn't there, huh?  Yeah.  Good thing they didn't see that.  Now, as far as the legality of this goes, since I do have a microphone... 
[00:53:30]  Yes.  ...I believe the only real problem here is the bullhorn.  Why?  There's something about amplified voice that is a disturbance that you're not allowed to do it without a permit.  Amplified vulgarity?  Or, yeah, vulgarity, stuff like that.  Although I don't know if the vulgarity itself...  Is that something else you haven't really researched?  No, but I have Mike.  Okay.  It's right here. 
[00:54:00]  Look.  Why don't we get real experts on the phone?  I do believe...  We have lawyers in the audience.  You're allowed to say anything.  We got the NYPD.  They love us.  Once you say it through a bullhorn, it enters a whole other realm.  And you're not allowed to do that.  So there's no problem with what is being picked up?  And that, I don't believe, is a problem either.  I know selling it is a problem, but dropping something on the street, that might be...  Yeah.  Is that guy still out there?  Can we call him a baby?  Just really quick, because no one's going to talk.  Baby.  I think the cops are down the street waiting. 
[00:54:30]  Fucking pussy, you're going to call your mom.  This is what I say we do.  We got the video?  Yeah.  I think we got to Photoshop other items into the video.  Oh, like...  So the black lady...  A puggle?  Yeah, the black lady, instead of picking up the gigantic white dildo with the veins called Mighty Kong.  Yeah, there's a puggle she's picking up.  A puggle.  It's a garment bag.  I don't know what kind of problem the items are.  We got Billy Mac.  He knows the deal.  Oh!  This segment is called, He Knows the Deal. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, we know Billy Mac knows the deal.  Billy Mac, how are you doing?  What's up, guys?  Just coming back from Charlotte, North Carolina.  Listening to that bit, it was excellent.  By the way, you just need a sound device permit.  You can get that from the local precinct.  A sound device permit.  That's it.  And then you can open a window and shout down to somebody.  Well, pretty much.  You kind of have to, like, lie a little while you need the sound device.  But, yeah, that's what it was.  And what are the rules with certain items being on the sidewalk? 
[00:55:30]  The old sidewalk.  What if there's a dildo on the sidewalk?  There you go.  Well, has it been used?  No, it's wrapped in the package.  Brand spanking new.  Brand new.  Oh, I don't think you put that there, though, right?  Well, let's say...  For the sake of argument, we did.  Yeah, would we be able to?  What is the law against putting a dildo on the sidewalk?  I don't think there's any law that says you can't put it there.  You're not selling it, so you don't need a Douglas permit.  That's what I'm thinking.  I'm thinking that as long as you're not selling it, there's not a problem about porno being sold somewhere or... 
[00:56:00]  The janitor might think you're littering, though.  And can we get away with...  All right, it could be a littering problem.  That's like how they got Al Capone.  Al Capone on litteration.  A littering ticket.  Who cares?  That's going to bring down the Opie and Anthony show?  A littering ticket?  Please.  Where's our balls?  Where do they go?  And can we go across the street and punch the janitor in the face?  What would we get for that?  Isn't that what you got, Matt?  Open hand.  We'll slap him.  No, we personally want to do it. 
[00:56:30]  What would happen to us?  Just one good punch to the face.  Oh, I think that'll be fine.  Now, how many thousand?  How many thousand?  Maybe a Descartes ticket and about 10 grand.  Yeah, you probably got to pay that guy off.  You don't want to do that.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't want to hit him.  I just want to annoy him.  All right.  I want to...  Now it's like a battle.  Now he got the last hit on us.  Yeah.  Sends the cops up.  Anthony, do you really believe he's going to get the last hit?  He's just winning right now.  This is his first win. 
[00:57:00]  He has the ball.  He's got a nice drive going.  Is that guy out there?  You think we're not going to pick it off and take it back for a touchdown?  Is he out there?  I like the puke idea, though.  Let me see.  Yeah, I like the idea of sending people over there to vomit on his sidewalk.  I want people puking in front of his sidewalk.  Is he out there?  No, I see a big wet spot, like right in front, like where his mop was.  Yeah.  So he was out there.  If I know my mop bucket puddles, about 10 minutes, he's been gone.  Hey, make sure Mars has the mics near the window, because the next time he appears, we're going to run. 
[00:57:30]  We could yell without the bullhorn.  No problem.  He'll be able to hear us.  Yeah, I don't think there's any law against yelling out a window.  People used to do it all the time.  Right.  Atlas!  You have a phone call!  Come on.  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!  They'll be arresting people left and right.  All right, guys, punch it out.  All right, there you go.  Billy Max.  Entire cast of West Side Story.  You guys, that ends Billy Max, he knows the deal segment. 
[00:58:00]  Everyone wants their own segment on this show.  Lawyer Kev is going to add to this.  Lawyer Kev, what's up?  Boys, it's Scumbag Lawyer Kev.  How you doing?  Hello.  Hey, Kev.  Listen, you can put anything on the sidewalk.  You can't use the bullhorn unless you've got a sound permit.  Billy Max, right on that.  But the sidewalk stuff is just bullshit.  As long as you don't draw a crowd, and then they start saying that it's disorderly conduct,  which is a violation.  It's not even a misdemeanor.  Now, I think there is a problem.  They could get you for littering. 
[00:58:30]  I mean, possibly for littering, but I mean, that's not even a violation.  Yeah, that's...  Well, what if you intended to pick it up afterwards?  Like, it's not littering if you put it there,  just to put it there to attract attention to it.  That's correct.  I would say that has to go to your intent, Anthony.  Right.  So, therefore, since you didn't intend to litter, I think you'd be okay.  But now, okay, what about if the box has, like, really rank porno pictures on it?  Well, I mean, again, there's no, you know, thank God for New York City. 
[00:59:00]  There is no, in New York State, there is no law against photographic pictures being displayed.  I mean, you walk by those newsstands all the time, you'll see a couple...  Yeah.  Do they actually have them right out there where anybody can walk by, look in, in the newsstands,  and see tits?  They might have a tiny, tiny little star over the nip.  Yeah.  Well, see, that's the thing, though.  The tiny star means something.  No, no, there is, because I remember my little sister came down here to visit,  and I was walking through the village, and I was like, Jesus Christ, you know? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Every other block you went to, there was just something...  Gay porn with a little star over this huge hard-on.  Not even that.  I'm just talking about regular good old heterosexual sex.  Josh from Rochester.  Josh?  Yo, why don't we call up Howard, since he's done everything,  and ask him what the legality issues are.  Oh, that's a great idea.  That's a good idea.  Let's get Howard on the phone.  Call up Howard, since he's probably done this before,  because he's done everything in radio.  Right.  Let's ask him, because he'd know the law.  You guys are great, man. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, Josh, you rock.  Let's say hi to Dan.  Hey, Dan.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, listen, you've got a few problems, potentially.  Number one, you've got a problem with the possibility of using profanity.  Now, what is the law against profanity?  Well, that's disorderly conduct.  The disorderly...  I've heard...  Hey, dude, is it true?  I've heard disorderly conduct is the rap that is like the universal fucking rap.  It is.  It is.  If you need to get somebody on something, but you don't really have anything, you could 
[01:00:30]  always get them on disorderly.  It is.  And it would have to be witnessed by a police officer.  That's half the problem, because it is only a violation of somebody else's...  Right, so somebody, let's say a guy with a mop can't tell a cop that somebody was yelling  at him profanity than...  Yeah, listen, can I cut to the chase here?  He could.  He could make a complaint, but you've got a couple other things...  Hold on.  I want to cut to the chase, though.  Okay, go ahead.  Go ahead.  The Opie and Anthony show is not worried about disorderly conduct.  I wouldn't be worried if that was...  We'll take that with no problem. 
[01:01:00]  Wait, wait.  They could take you to jail for that, though.  It'll be worse.  I'll take the rap on disorderly conduct.  I've heard about the baloney.  Anthony will take the rap on...  Will you take the rap on littering?  I'll take littering.  All right.  What else we got to worry about?  We can handle 15-day rap, anyway.  15-day.  Well, if you continue to go after the guy, then the mop guy, it could be considered harassment.  Harassment, yeah.  Harassment?  If you use electronic means, then it could be aggravated harassment, which now you're rising  to the level of a...  What if we yell to a rolled-up newspaper? 
[01:01:30]  Oh, that's just harassment.  That's only a 15-day rap, so I wouldn't worry about it.  And the only...  What I see as a potential problem is if any kids get a hold of the porno.  They have to be careful about that.  Right.  See, now, what if a kid's walking by and glances down at some pretty graphic porno that's on  the packaging?  They're not going to know what a dildo is.  That could be something like, what, endangering the welfare?  They will now.  Exactly.  Exactly.  That could be a little rough.  I don't want to be a buzzkill, because I thought it was funny myself, but I just want to give  you the story. 
[01:02:00]  No, we kind of like knowing what the laws are.  I mean, so that way when we break them and get hauled away, at least we're not asking  questions.  Yeah, and you know how much time you're going to have to do.  All right, boys, punch it out.  Thank you, man.  Thank you, sir.  I got to tell you.  Oh, I wanted to ask him about the puking.  Is there a law against puking on the sidewalk?  I just figured this all out, man.  The Bill Burr line really hurt that guy.  Oh, yeah.  To the point where he's like, fuck those guys.  He's the key to your dreams?  Stop it.  I got to call the cops.  I killed him.  See how he's already ratting me up? 
[01:02:30]  He's already anticipating the cops coming up here, and he's saying that I was the guy.  That went right to his soul, man.  That guy did not like that one.  Let's see.  Well, let's say hi to Greg in New Jersey.  Greg?  Hey, fellas.  How are you?  All right.  Listen, I was just thinking, if you guys put porn on the sidewalk, don't you think they  might come after you for some sort of bullshit corruption of a minor because you can't control  who's walking down the sidewalk?  Yeah, that's what I think.  There'd be something like that.  Well, we had something in place that protected us from that. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  Punch it out, guys.  What?  We have something in place?  We did.  Like a couple of guys that could have snatched it up real quickly.  Hey, kid's coming.  Get it out of there.  Exactly.  They're not taking this bit away from us.  We're going to do it again, and we will have the video up on the website.  Can we get Sam Adams to sponsor this?  We'll call it Sex Toys for Sam.  No?  He sort of rings a bell.  You've heard of Son of Sam. 
[01:03:30]  Well, he's bad.  Sex for Sam 2.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  Um, yeah.  No!  Um, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shut up, stupid.  Grab your mop.  Yeah, I want Mop Guy.  I want him now.  He is mine. 
[01:04:00]  He will not get away.  He called the cops on us.  What a pussy.  He called the cops on us!  What a pussy.  I have a suggestion.  Oh!  Francine!  Drive by in your Escalade on a, on a rainy day and splash him.  And splash him.  He wouldn't be out there on a rainy day because it would be raining, so he probably wouldn't  be mopping or sweeping.  Is there an awning?  Why don't you put a, just, just put a t-shirt out there.  No awning.  Just put a t-shirt out there.  Put a t-shirt out like bait, and then put a, get a puddle, wait for a big puddle, and 
[01:04:30]  then I'll sit there and, and drive through it and splash him.  Let's go to Josh in Brooklyn.  Josh?  Yo, what's up guys?  Hey.  You guys are on regular radio.  You break every fucking rule.  You get a guy to get a hummer from a dead monkey.  All of a sudden you get on XM, and now you're worried about breaking the rules?  I'm with Josh!  I'm not worried about-  Where did our balls go?  I'm not worried about breaking the rules.  I'm worried about getting arrested for it.  I'm not built for jail.  There's, there's, there's getting arrested, then there's getting arrested. 
[01:05:00]  This is like, ah, getting arrested.  Let's look at who we've had arrested.  All right.  Uh, Rick.  Our role producer, Rick.  Mm-hmm.  Who was like a, a monster anyway.  Right.  Like, Rick was very strong.  He's good for jail.  Uh, Jimmy-  Probably took over the prison.  Probably did.  Took over the cell, ran things for a while, cigarette concession.  And then, uh, Jimmy Norton.  Okay.  He's been arrested because of this program.  Sure.  Uh, Jimmy looks too crazy to fuck with in jail.  He's one of those guys.  And he's not cute enough to the guys to want to have sex with him. 
[01:05:30]  So, Jimmy's fine.  Much to his chagrin.  Yeah.  Much to his chagrin.  Yeah, a little disappointing for Jimmy, but that's just the way it worked out for him.  Uh, Louis Black.  Louis Black, yes.  Comedian Louis Black was arrested for this program.  Um, he, he just, I don't know.  It's Louis.  What's he gonna do?  He's like the guy that they would go to to get legal advice, you know, from, you know,  how do I get, what you gotta do is get the lawyer.  And they wouldn't fuck with him. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, he moves too much.  Yeah, they would.  They'd fuck with Louis?  He'd be like that guy in the end of Boogie Nights on his knees crying.  You think?  I think Louis would hold up good because he, I don't know, he, he is a little crazy and  he's kind of knowledgeable.  They might be able to use him for something than just, what, like a Shawshank Redemption?  Yeah, he could do their taxes.  He'd get the boys some suds.  Some, some beers for doing the roof work.  And then, uh, Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark, yes. 
[01:06:30]  Who, you know, by name alone, you just don't fuck with Psycho Mark.  Right.  Me?  I'm done.  I'm done.  Look at me.  I weigh 145 pounds.  Psycho Mar will get stabbed.  If you go in there with a name like Psycho now, it's like.  Psycho Mark.  You gotta prove yourself.  Yeah, you think you're crazier than me?  Yeah.  And the Tim Robbins character got raped repeatedly in that movie.  Even in Hollywood, you get raped.  Yeah.  Even in the movies.  Well, see, that's what I don't want.  You go to jail, Opie.  Fine.  You gonna take the rap? 
[01:07:00]  I'll take the rap for stupid littering or disorderly conduct.  That's easy stuff.  Are you willing to get raped for it?  I'll take a ticket.  If it comes in a ticket that the cop writes up, I'll take it.  We can't be pussies.  This is a new bit I like.  I like it, too.  We've just begun with it.  We're gonna develop it now.  We just threw the idea around in the office.  All you're doing is figuring out the fucking parameters.  That's all we're doing.  We're not saying we're not gonna do it.  We're just pushing, seeing where it gets. 
[01:07:30]  That's all.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Hey, I'm Jon Stewart, and I listen to Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Angel.  Hi.  Hey, this is Jim Norton.

[01:10:30]  XM 144.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Awful.  Top 10 sports films of all time.  10th place, Raging Bull.  That would have been my pick for, like, number one or two.  Definitely.  That movie rocked.  What was the line from that?  Hey, Ray, you never knocked me down.  Ray?  Hey, Ray, you never knocked me down.  When De Niro got the S kicked out of him.  Which is great.  9th place, Anthony.  Slapshot. 
[01:11:00]  That should have been higher on the list.  Raging Bull should have been higher on the list, I think.  8th place, Chariots of Fire.  7th place, Caddyshack.  Number 6, Brian Song.  Who could sit through that?  Number 5, Bull Dorm.  Number 4, Rocky.  Anne thought Rocky should be number 1.  Hey, Edwin.  I got a glass table.  Why don't you squat over it and take a dump?  And I'll be underneath it.  And you can grab on me. 
[01:11:30]  Mickey, grab on me, Mickey!  Ah!  Wasn't that written somewhere in some whore's book?  Yeah, we interviewed the whores from that book.  And they claim, according to their book, that Rocky was into watching girls crap on a glass table while he was under it.  But you know what's better than maybe laying underneath the table, you know?  And like, watching a sphincter open up and just dump it out of me!  Oh my God, I'm out of your face! 
[01:12:00]  Out of my face, Mickey!  Oh!  Oh!  Come on, baby.  Why don't you, you know, open it up and give me one over the glass table.  Oh, yeah, baby.  That's how I like it.  Sloppy.  I didn't start this!  You started this!  Yeah, give me some. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, look at that.  There's some corn in there.  What's that I see?  Oh, look, I see some peanuts.  Mickey!  She ate peanuts, Mickey!  You know, when a girl squats over a table like that, you're hoping, you know, it's a nice sloppy dump.  You know, you don't want anything to do.  That's a good one.  Yeah, baby.  Oh, that's a little driver.  You know, I don't know where Adrian went. 
[01:13:00]  Adrian must have left the building.  But, hey, Pauly.  Pauly, get over here and squat on the table, Pauly.  Pauly, squat on the table!  Oh, Pauly!  Give it to me, Pauly!  Oh!  Oh, Pauly!  Big fat ass, Pauly! 
[01:13:30]  Hey, Pauly, where's he going?  Now who's going to squat over the table?  Hell yeah.  Hey, Mickey!  Hey, Mickey, come on over here.  Squat on the table, Mickey.  Oh, Mickey!  Oh, no, look, it's first blood!  Mickey, you do first blood! 
[01:14:00]  Not me!  I destroyed it!  You destroyed it!  Ah!  Ah!  Mickey!  Mickey, grab on the table, Mickey!  Ah!  Rocky's full of crab now!  Oh, great.  Okay, where's my check?  Oh! 
[01:14:30]  Ah, whatever.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ha ha ha!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That's wonderful!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Okay, terrific. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, boy.  Okay, horrific.  That's just disgusting.  That's what they said.  Well, according to that book, yeah.  The book that the whore wrote that Rocky Sylvester Stallone actually enjoys that.  Squatting him to the table.  We have a brand new glass table here in front of the lesbian couch.  How long do you think it's going to take before we have that little happening?  We promise before we get fired that we'll make that happen. 
[01:15:30]  Someone's doing a Cleveland steamer on the glass table.  I love it.  Hey, goodbye.  Squatting him to the table.  Where'd you eat?  Some bran or something?  Where'd you eat?  Come on, baby.  I just want you.  I'm going to hold you hostage for a week straight.  And I want you to eat nothing but prunes and baby food.  Before you get on with it.  You whore.  Come on, you whore. 
[01:16:00]  You whore.  Open it up and jump on me.  Jump on me.  I just tried to use it.  Ah!  Ah!  Ha ha ha!  It's your joke.  Ha ha ha.  Oh.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Remember, kids, fart equals funny. 
[01:16:30]  Okay, where were we?  Oh, we were at number four.  This has been such a mess of a radio show today, man.  Why not?  I'm having fun.  I don't care.  Yeah, what the hell.  All right.  We don't care.  So I guess we're at the top five.  Top five sports films of all time, according to USA.  Well, we said five Bull Dorum.  Yeah, but that was about 20 minutes ago.  All right.  It was Bull Dorum in fifth place.  Fourth place, Rocky.  Yeah.  Third place, The Natural.  Yeah.  Give it to me.  Third place, The Natural. 
[01:17:00]  It's a natural movement.  Ha ha ha.  I like it natural.  Ha ha ha.  It's just too bad.  Adrian always does it natural.  She don't need no cow pecta or none of that stuff.  It just comes out.  Yeah, Adrian!  Get ready!  Okay, terrific.  Yeah, okay, terrific to you, too.  All the guys I went to high school with, they got real jobs.  They have to wear suits every day, and we make fart jokes every day.  Oh, do I need a drink? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, let's take a break, Anthony.  All righty.  Let's do it!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is Jim Blessingame, the small business advocate with a small business minute.  One of the most important concepts for any small business owner to embrace is leverage.  Right now, let's talk about leveraging other people's time, energy, and brain power.  You must be able to share the vision for your business with managers,  because they must be able to help you establish goals that will take your company to the winner's circle. 
[01:18:00]  Then, all of you must be able to manage the business in a way that accomplishes those goals.  If your vision and the goals are to stay on track, have regular sessions where the company leadership revisits your plan  and compares it to actual performance.  With this measurement, you can run a finely tuned organization.  Without it, you've got something that looks more like a goat roping or a cat roundup.  Write this on a rock.  You must share your vision with your managers and staff. 
[01:18:30]  This is Jim Blessingame, the small business advocate.  I'll see you on the radio or on the internet at smallbusinessadvocate.com.

I like my penis.  So, anyway, we do have one, maybe, we only have one PSP left?  I thought we had four total. 
[01:21:00]  What happened?  Well, we have, uh.  I took one.  Opie took one.  How many does that leave?  We should have two left because we're going to do something with, like, the rest of the guys, like Eric, Ben, Steve, Travis, Derek, Danny, Nathaniel.  The guys were drooling.  I felt bad.  They come in and poor Travis looks at me like, I don't have one of those.  I want one.  You, you motherfucker, can just go with, you know, your lunch money and go and buy one.  And, uh, he looked like he wanted one. 
[01:21:30]  So, those guys really want one.  And on the mere pittance they're paid to work here, I'm sure they can't just go out and buy it.  This is good.  It's got, like, the one gig memory card and everything.  And, uh, so I guess we're going to be giving a PSP to one of the staff.  One?  Someone stole the other one, then.  Where's the other one?  Did someone steal the other one?  There's a new controversy, uh, kicking up here.  Because there was supposed to be two for the rest of the staff. 
[01:22:00]  I only took one home.  Because Jimmy wanted one, but he wasn't sure if he was going to use it.  So, I'm like, Jimmy, you know, let's let, um, you know, these guys have it.  And then if you really want one, we'll just, uh, tell them.  Yeah, Opie gave Jimmy's away.  Yeah.  Like, yeah.  You fucker, I did not.  You did.  I go, are you going to use it?  You go, I don't know.  I don't use it, but the other, it was all because, it was because of the BlackBerry.  Like, I didn't use the BlackBerry.  She's like, well, if you don't use the BlackBerry, you won't use this.  Then you won't get this.  Yeah.  BlackBerry I would have used if they didn't make you tie it into your XM account.  So we had to punish you.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to be punished.  Punished. 
[01:22:30]  Well, there's a new controversy, though.  There's only one PSP left.  Someone took off with the, uh, fourth one.  That's what I'm thinking.  Look at Hawk running around, not like a madman.  Steve's running around.  Oh, now Steve is going into the office.  See, now there's a problem.  Nathaniel is digging through, uh, Ben's desk pile.  Who took it?  Who took it?  The guys in this room are not even looking at us anymore.  Did they find it?  Wow, something's going on.  Something is going on outside the studio.  Here comes Eric.  It looks like he might have found something.  Ah.  Does he have it in his hand? 
[01:23:00]  I think he does.  There it is.  Where was it, Eric?  Where was it?  It was on Ben's desk.  Oh, Ben.  Does Ben want it?  I don't know.  He's not here.  Oh, okay.  Well, here's the dilemma.  So we got, how many people want this?  Pretty much everybody?  Steve?  Yeah.  Steve wants it.  Nathaniel wants it.  Travis wants it.  Dirk wants it.  Danny wants it.  I see you, Danny.  So, but we only have two.  So we want to have some kind of competition with these guys today.  Are those two different types? 
[01:23:30]  Is one better than the other?  Two different types.  One has the memory card?  The one gig?  Wait, which one has the one gig?  One has a one gig and one has a 32 megabyte.  Oh, boy.  Wait a minute.  One of the blue box rocks.  The first and a second prize.  Uh-oh.  Holy shit.  I didn't get a blue box.  Oh, dude.  You got the shitty memory card then.  Is that all the difference?  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  You sure?  32?  How much is the gigs in the big one?  You get one gig in the big one, and you get like 32 megs on this one.  Oh, okay.  You can't really fit much. 
[01:24:00]  What can you fit on one gig, though?  Can you fit a lot of movies on one gig?  Uh, no, not really.  A lot of songs.  You hold them.  They're like the little handheld things, and you can watch movies on them.  Those are great, man.  Yeah.  I like those.  They're selling movies for this now.  Yeah, you can put movies in there.  You pop them in a disc in the back.  The disc goes in there.  Yeah.  But can you put a stand for them?  Because you've got to hold them right now.  Yeah, there is a little stand.  Ooh.  A little plastic stand came with a blue box.  It looks like we're going to have to get another PSP.  No, no, no. 
[01:24:30]  Just because it's a six-hour flight.  That's pretty cool on a six-hour flight.  One is the giga pack, and the other is the value.  Value pack.  Value pack.  You don't want the value pack.  Shit, I got the wrong one.  You got the value pack?  No wonder your battery wasn't charged.  Mine was charged and made of solid gold.  Amazing.  Love it.  That's a not true.  Anthony, you're Italian.  I corrected everybody.  No.  Did you just say that's a not true?  I was going to say that's bullshit. 
[01:25:00]  That's a not true.  Anthony in Pennsylvania, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to say that corporations these days, just by the very nature of your  computers being on their network, they can lift things off your hard drive and check  your email in real time.  Yeah.  Yeah, I totally believe that.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's crazy, man.  So you have no privacy.  If you take the computer and run, it does nothing.  If they really wanted to, they'd have all that today, tomorrow.  Now, back at NEW, they didn't have that technology there.  Yeah, we get to go back a few years. 
[01:25:30]  Now, the same scenario, you're right.  But I don't think they had that in place back then.  Now everything goes through their filter.  All right.  Thanks, Anthony.  Tell them Fred is writing, if you remember, Jim didn't even know what a PSP was in his  pop culture quiz.  Probably not, but I didn't know.  Do we have the second pop culture quiz for Jim Norman today?  But I knew what it is by sight, because I just didn't know what it was called.  Okay.  What's in the name?  Shakespeare wrote something about a rose.  All right, listen.  What?  So we got these two PSPs to give away. 
[01:26:00]  How are we going to do it?  These guys want to have a little competition to see who gets the PSPs.  Got to be a competition.  Yeah.  Maybe the listeners could come up with something.  Something quick and fast for this.  Got to be a competition.  No, not arm wrestling.  No, not arm wrestling.  Silly.  That means Travis doesn't get one.  No.  Not at all.  A little broken arm.  Yeah.  Fucking spindly douche.  Who would you say would win an arm wrestling contest?  Nathaniel.  Obviously.  Yeah.  He's a lot bigger than everyone else.  Yeah, he's taller, but I would have picked Derek. 
[01:26:30]  I would have picked Derek.  No?  You know that Nathaniel was this close to getting that giantism thing that we were talking about  last week?  He's like, what are you, 6'4"?  That's not that close to the giantism, big-headed thing.  When did you stop growing?  You're talking about slipping a chromosome or something.  No, he looks fine, but you know, you probably were starting to sweat it, right?  No, I was, you know.  How tall are you?  Six. 
[01:27:00]  I'd like to say six, five.  I was growing six inches every year.  And then my parents started to notice something wrong with my head, so they took me to a specialist.  And that's when I was diagnosed with giantism.  Here's some of my baby pictures.  They're perfectly normal, up until eight months old.  That's when my parents started going, I think there's something wrong with my child, took  me to the doctor. 
[01:27:30]  Big misshapen head.  They had the tallest man in the world, what's his name, that we were talking about last week?  Yeah.  Waslow, or whatever his name was.  Yeah.  And they have a picture of him in like sixth grade.  Oh, it's always the sixth grade picture.  He's towering over, just ruining the photo.  It's not even close.  Here I am in sixth grade.  That was already six age.  Of course, I'm in the back row.  This is Mary.  I remember I had quite a crush on her, and she ran in horror, screaming from me. 
[01:28:00]  Inside of that big head.  And my lurch poster's on the wall.  I had to relate to somebody back then.  What size is your shoe?  I have a size 28 shoe.  My feet kept growing very hard for my mother to keep me in clothes.  Yeah.  I would grow out of them by the next morning.  I bet you have a special bed, possibly.  Yes, actually.  I had to put two beds foot to head to sleep for quite a while when I was at home. 
[01:28:30]  And then I would wake up, and they built a dormer for me in the attic because I kept cracking my head on the ceiling.  The ceiling was 10 foot 3.  I kept cracking my big, stupid-looking, misshapen head.  My to-serve-man, Twilight Zone head.  And I hear your brother was normal size, right?  Well, the rest of my family were all normal size.  Yeah.  So I really looked freakish. 
[01:29:00]  But I bet you were a normal kid.  Just a normal kid.  I loved actually playing baseball.  Yeah.  I loved sports.  You had a six-foot strike zone.  Very hard to pitch to.  Of course, if I did hit the ball, I couldn't run at all.  I just looked like some freaky creep.  It was great.  I'm trying to run.  I look more like that big alien that came out of the ship in close encounters at the end, raising his arms. 
[01:29:30]  What about showering?  All these things that you take for granted.  Very difficult for me and my giant, misshapen head.  I would try to take a shower.  Actually, the water, the highest I could get it was penis height.  So I was big, but I had very clean genitals.  I couldn't shampoo my hair on that huge misshapen head.  Sometimes puddles would form in those crevices in my head.  I thought you were a normal kid. 
[01:30:00]  I just tried to be normal.  You know, just try to fit in with everybody.  Here's me at my prom.  Here's a picture of me at my prom.  Yes, it does look completely ridiculous.  It's me and Thumbelina at the prom.  Well, weren't you getting nervous there, Nathaniel?  6'5"?  You've got to start thinking when you're getting up over 6. 
[01:30:30]  Do the parents think that they're going to have to deal with, uh-oh, the neighbors are going to make fun?  Well, my dad's 6'6", so.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  Mine's pretty tall.  Mom's 5'10".  Wow.  Wow.  You could have been a lot taller, even.  Yeah.  I think I got the nice normal side of the bell curve.  You definitely did all right.  You got any siblings, do you?  I do.  How tall?  My brother is about the same height, too.  Man.  You just must be the family walking down the street like, ah!  Just a bunch of them. 
[01:31:00]  Give us your shit, Nathaniel.  Did you play basketball?  Yes, I did.  How many times have you been asked that?  Every.  Every fucking day, right?  Yeah, every time someone meets me.  What about the Giants?  What about the Giants in the studio?  Were you talked into playing basketball?  Well, I got a lot of joint problems.  Yeah.  I got the osteoporosis.  Yeah.  I have some rheumatoid arthritis, so it makes it hard to really move.  I was tall enough to put the ball in the basket, but once they passed the ball to me, I really 
[01:31:30]  couldn't move on the floor at all.  Very difficult.  Lumbering.  Lumbering.  I looked like a newborn moose.  Just big, big knobby joints that couldn't really move.  Not sure.  Sometimes my legs would shake and I'd fall down.  Very difficult.  All right.  Big head that could probably fit moose antlers, too.  Nathaniel, you got a good idea for the PSP giveaway for you guys?  Um, well, there was some mention of staples. 
[01:32:00]  Staple gun roulette?  Yeah.  You know, when I saw that email, I thought, great idea.  I'd been through it.  I'd been through it.  I'd been through the staple gun challenge.  Yep.  It, uh, the fans seemed to really enjoy it.  So, I don't know.  That could be a good one.  You know how that works, don't you?  Uh.  Do you recall?  Yeah.  I believe you take a, uh, newspaper.  Ordinary newspaper, the Daily News, the Post. 
[01:32:30]  Uh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Put it on your leg.  Put it over your leg.  It's pretty thick, the newspaper.  Take a standard staple gun and through the newspaper.  Of course, what will that do?  Nothing.  Yeah.  Doesn't do anything.  Then the other guy does it.  Nothing.  Now, here's the trick.  You take away a page.  Just one page.  It's paper thin.  What difference could it make?  Probably none. 
[01:33:00]  Nothing.  Nothing.  Another page goes.  Repeat, repeat, repeat.  Before you know it, you go, ooh, I think the staple is making it through the paper because  you feel a little tinge on your leg.  Another page, another.  Before you know it, a lot of that staple is coming through the paper and going into your  leg.  And who wins?  The one that, uh, has the least amount of pages left.  Or no pages.  It's a great idea, but knowing these guys, they'll go the distance, all of them. 
[01:33:30]  Even frail little Travis.  Dude.  They will all grail little Travis.  Staple goes through his leg breaks.  Comes out he's stuck to the chair.  A waffer thin gentleman, sir.  A little toothpick leg.  Well, we've got to figure this out.  I don't know if that's going to work.  I'm telling you.  I think these guys will all take it, uh, a staple.  I, I thought, you know, when you first start the game, you're, you're all cocky thinking,  you know, you're going to go the distance when it starts going through and really hurting. 
[01:34:00]  It's very hard to work up the guts to do that next one.  And the next one.  I say a nail gun with the New York Times.  Well, we can start with the Sunday Times, you know, just to give it a little, uh, a little  padding.  How about over the ball bag?  Ooh, over the ball bag.  For the staple.  Jimmy will do the stapling.  No, that can really injure some vital components.  I would if we use like a regular staple that you have to hit and has to be on the desk. 
[01:34:30]  We've got to shove your yam bag in the old swing line.  All right, well, we have to figure this out.  If you guys, any of the other boys have a, have an idea for this contest?  No?  Wow.  Uncreative bunch of asses.  Well, I was going to, I was thinking of an idea.  It's kind of hard to put the job to the people that are going to be winning it.  You know, all right.  Alphabetical order.  Height.  Height.  Yeah.  He picks height.  We got an eggnog drinking contest coming up. 
[01:35:00]  I think, by the way, it's going to be a week from Friday.  The eggnog drinking contest.  The eggnog drinking contest.  We could do, we could do the old drink water until you have the leak game.  I don't know about the drink water thing.  Why?  Last guy that runs out of here to take a leak?  Take a leak, yeah.  If they're drinking like, if they're drinking, I don't know, you know, a half a cup of water every minute.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[01:35:30]  People die from that.  They're not going to die from that?  That's one of those hazing things that people have been dying from.  Yeah.  But it's just these guys.  Yeah.  They're replaceable.  Don't get me wrong.  I don't care about them.  I just care about the lawsuit.  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  Their families probably care for them.  How about a chowder or something else that they won't die from?  Yeah.  They're not going to die from the water game.  You and I did that.  No, we didn't.  Way back in the day.  Well, the diaper?  And the drink in the water?  Yeah.  Wearing the depend all day? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  We weren't doing, like, shots, though, like that.  It was just drink normally and try not to piss.  I was drinking beers.  Beers might be, you know.  How about these guys decide, you know, how much water they could take?  It's up to them.  I don't know if they really know how much water will give them that fucking water on  the brain thing and put them in a water coma.  Get a doctor on the phone.  You really don't care whether we live or die, do you?  All right.  Let me ask you this, Nathaniel.  Would you do this bit? 
[01:36:30]  What?  Would you do the bit for the PSP?  Yes.  See?  Danny?  What about a power hour?  A power hour?  Shot a beer a minute for an hour?  Well, we can't do the beer thing.  Why?  They're kind of like employees and shit.  How about a duty contest?  I win.  Someone's got a great idea.  Fight club.  Yeah, but Nathaniel takes jujitsu.  He'd kick the shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Good point.  Yeah, he is a karate guy.  That's a good idea.  Good point.  The fact that water can cause fatal overdose is not well known.  It's called water intoxication. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, but how much does it take?  I hear it takes like gallons.  Water poisoning results when too much water is ingested in a short amount of time without  replenishing electrolytes, particularly sodium and potassium, which you need to kind of dilute  your system.  Get Gatorade.  Maintains an equilibrium, the human body of electrolytes in the bloodstream.  I'm trying to see how much.  Water poisoning deaths are real, although small.  Problem recreational use.  Health and water issue page.  Occasional deaths in the U.S. and Canada. 
[01:37:30]  Accidentally drinking too much water.  Some from intentional or forced overconsumption.  As a case of a young man required to drink two or more gallons of water as part of the college  fraternity hazing.  Two or more gallons of water this guy drank and he died.  What happens?  Your water fills your brain?  No, it dilutes your system so much that all the vital little nutrients like sodium, things  like that, aren't effective anymore on you. 
[01:38:00]  No, you've got to have weak DNA for that to happen.  You think you're weak?  You can't.  It's water.  It's stupid water.  Stop.  But we're not allowed to piss.  That's the problem.  No, no, no.  But when you're going to die, you can go.  Yeah.  Well, someone's suggesting the old icy hot on the balls trick.  Wow.  How do you win that?  That's a brutal one.  Yeah, how do you win that?  You don't.  We do.  It's an all-lose scenario.  Icy hot on the balls.  Jesus, Eric.  Eric just pulled out the icy hot. 
[01:38:30]  And his balls.  That's right.  All right, guys, line up.  Line up.  Swipe some on their nutsack.  Get a good one.  I don't like you shaving.  Get a good dollop.  Yeah, a dollop.  Let's get a dollop of icy hot.  Who's going to make sure that they put it on and how much?  And then what?  Eric, since he was so eager to take it out.  Yeah.  And then what?  It's like the last person to leave the studio to wipe it off.  It's brutal on the ballies. 
[01:39:00]  It's beyond brutal.  I don't know.  That's a good one?  But isn't there a way to make it even worse?  Like you put the icy hot and then it's like cold water?  Or you apply it with a Zim Zam paddle.  Meat tenderizer.  Well, Kevin in Minnesota has a great idea.  Kevin, go ahead.  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Up here in Minnesota, my brother and I get in trouble back in the day. 
[01:39:30]  My dad had those little mini three-foot canoe paddles.  Yeah.  It's nothing gay or queer or nothing, but I have the boys drop their pants and then have  Jimmy rear up on that paddle and give them shot for shot.  That is so gay.  Guys paddling other guys in any circumstance, in any context, sir, is so gay, so homoerotic.  Jimmy would be doing it.  He loves trannies.  Yeah, Jimmy.  I don't paddle other men. 
[01:40:00]  It's not happening unless they've been bad.  Well, this is more of a...  I wish I knew how to quit you.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Well, the icy hot thing could work.  Oh, you like that, don't you faggot?  Who would icy hot today for the PSP?  Definitely icy hot.  Daddy would icy hot.  But what's the end game?  The end game is they stay in the studio.  The screamer would get to the point they would have to run out.  I don't know.  Does that happen? 
[01:40:30]  I don't know if it happens.  And then the tie is decided by height.  I don't know.  I don't know if it happens.  If you wipe that on your nutsack, is it going to hurt?  There would be hell.  We need a test.  There would be hell.  We need someone to test first that isn't involved in the contest to see if it's worth doing  the contest for.  Because if we do the contest, then it doesn't work.  So somebody not involved in the contest is going to have to do it.  I have little balls. 
[01:41:00]  And that would make a difference.  You can serve the icy hot.  Wouldn't need as much.  Your tiny little nutsack.  Bring in Bill.  Oh, intern Bill.  Why don't we bring in...  Bill will do anything.  How about if Bill just takes just a slight dollop?  A slight dollop and wipes it on his nutsack. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Where is he?  We need a test subject.  Somewhere loading magazines?  Where is he?  Why don't we bring in Ben and then just put it on with a paint roller?  Bill's doing a food order.  Oh, Bill's doing a food order.  All right.  We'll wait for Bill to come back.  How's that?  We'll wait for Bill to come back.  He could swipe on a dollop and we'll see if it's really that bad where he has to flee  the studio.  Who would dollop for the PSP? 
[01:42:00]  Danny?  Eric?  Holy crap.  Eric's eligible?  No offense, but never mind.  No, I'll say it.  The guy won $100,000.  Thank you.  From show papers.  Go fuck yourself.  Buy it.  From show papers.  Still that controversy that you should have shared with everybody because it was the show's  paper.  Hey, he bought us a rock and roll sandwich.  What do you mean with show?  Eric, let's not dump on it too much.  That Philly cheesesteak was delicious.  Thanks, Eric.  What do you mean with show papers?  It was the papers from here, not his personal home paper. 
[01:42:30]  And yeah.  All right.  And he scratched it off and realized it was one of those false winners.  So he had to send it in and they drew it out of a hat.  Well, we need at least three contestants, though.  Well, I'm in.  If we don't get three, then Eric's in.  Travis is in.  Skinny.  I know Derek won't do it.  I know him pretty well.  Derek ain't fucking doing nothing.  Nothing with his ball bag.  He's just a creep with open-toed sandals.  Does he have that?  He always does.  His stupid little fucking toes sticking out. 
[01:43:00]  Why are you looking at feet?  How can you not look at them?  I don't understand guys that look at other guys' shoes and stuff.  Dude, you can't not see it when you look at a man's feet.  I don't look at a man's feet.  How do you not?  You know, this is.  You're not giving them on the up and down.  You're like a man.  You look them in the eye.  A bunch of people.  You'll suck my cock.  A bunch of people from Wack Bag were commenting on the fact that I was wearing sandals.  I was wearing sandals with white socks.  Remember that?  Well, that is silly.  It was a whole thread.  Well, because I inline skate to work, and it's easy just to throw on some TVs or something 
[01:43:30]  after I get here.  And all these people are like, what's wrong with open-up that he's wearing sandals with  white socks?  And I'm sitting there at home like, why are you guys talking about the fact that I have  white socks and sandals on?  Who took the picture?  Put it online.  It was a fan that wanted a picture of some one day after the show.  I'm like, yeah, no problem.  Oh.  And then they're commenting because I got, you know, I still got the TVs on with the  white socks because it was after the show.  I'm ready to take the TVs off and throw my skates on.  Yeah.  But then they have a whole discussion about this. 
[01:44:00]  Bill do that.  It was bizarre to me.  I'm coming into work with a bunch of guys.  It doesn't matter what we look like.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So where's Bill?  Food order.  Still.  All right.  So we got three.  One, two.  We got to have Eric do it, too, man.  Just for fun.  Yeah.  Rich Eric.  Yeah.  For fun.  Wealthy Eric.  Yeah.  There are two of these, right?  Yeah.  It's not like there's only one.  I don't know why I had to say that if you said there's two. 
[01:44:30]  So what's it going to be?  The last two left?  That's kind of.  Well, that's what we got to figure out.  I think there should be two separate contests.  If anyone has done this Icy Hot thing, give us a call because we got to figure out the  details.  Yeah, I don't know.  I think what's going to happen, I'm assuming that it's going to be so brutal you're going  to want it just off you, and that's when you just run out of the studio to take care  of yourself in the bathroom.  Does it get hotter, though?  I don't know.  How does Icy Hot work, Hope?  I don't know.  We need some Icy Hot experts.  How about we take a break?  We'll use Bill as a test subject. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  And then we'll get the rest of the guys who want in, and they'll do it, and then we'll  get a winner.  Oh, Steve doesn't want in?  No.  Steve?  No.  Bill's back, by the way.  He has no idea what we were talking about.  No, I've put Icy Hot on the balls before.  That hurts.  You have?  Where?  Where is it?  It burns.  It burns a lot.  I mean, like, just residual stuff.  Like, I mean, I've been putting it on, like, sore muscles and then went to scratch my nuts,  kind of.  All right.  And that hurts enough.  Someone's got a great idea.  I'm going to do it again.  Someone's got a great idea. 
[01:45:30]  Bib from Whack Bag.  Add more Icy Hot as the contest goes along.  Hmm.  That's a great idea.  You're going to have a fan to blow air on it.  Ooh.  Oh, you mean, like, a mechanical fan?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just a fan of men's nuts.  Making his way into the studio, it's Bill the intern.  There he is.  Hey, everyone.  Who's crazy.  Bill, we got an idea.  Mm-hmm.  But then maybe we should have him in on the contest. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, please.  He's a ringer.  Yeah.  He wouldn't even wipe it off when the contest was over.  No.  All right, Bill.  Walk around the rest of the day with it on his side.  Bill, here's the idea, okay?  Mm-hmm.  We got Nathaniel, Danny, Travis, you're in, right?  All right, Travis and possibly Eric.  They're going to try to win these PSPs that we got yesterday.  We want to do an Icy Hot contest.  Okay.  But we need a test subject to see how bad it would actually be.  Oh, yeah?  So all we're asking is if you would just take just a little of this Icy Hot. 
[01:46:30]  It's extra strength.  He knew we weren't going to ask him to find somebody to test it.  Right.  And then just take a little dollop.  You don't have to go crazy.  Throw it on your ball sack.  And we wanted to see how effective this contest would be.  Because it seems that things don't affect you like other human beings.  Yeah.  So we're thinking if we do get a good reaction out of you, then the reaction out of these guys  will be even that much.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Just a little, I guess.  All right, good.  I'll try.  All right. 
[01:47:00]  And we don't want to see you actually doing it.  So you can, like, turn around and throw it on your...  Yeah, turn around.  Well, how do we know who's seriously...  How do you know who's putting how much on their bag?  Yeah, you guys can't cheat.  That's true.  You guys can't cheat?  Please.  That's all I would do is cheat.  We...  We...  Somebody.  You're going to have to see the bags.  And I'm not being a fucking...  The bottom line is this.  You're going to have to see the bags.  No, I'm not looking at no bags.  How about this?  You got to keep your mule in, but you just pop your bag out for this effort.  It's a bunch of bags.  Who cares?  Why don't you make Bill the spotter? 
[01:47:30]  Just hang the brain a little.  Just fucking bags.  So what?  Why him?  Why are you going to make Ray watch ball bags?  He's just concocting...  We don't pay him.  He's concocting his own fantasy here.  Yeah.  Ben's ball bags.  Ray.  Some Icy Hot.  Come here.  Ray does a great job...  No, over there.  Ray, what are you doing?  Ray does a great job for us behind the scenes, and he has a killer radio voice.  Would you watch guys put Icy Hot on their ball bags?  Sure. 
[01:48:00]  Talk it in the mic.  Sure.  You don't mind?  I don't care.  Wait, do we have to agree, too?  Yeah, these guys would probably mind.  I like Ray.  I'm thinking...  Yeah, Ray's a good guy.  You got to have a...  You don't want to go whipping your bag out.  You got to have a spotter.  You have to for something.  It's not fair if you don't.  How about if they're down in their underwear, and then they pull the front out a little  bit, and they got the dollop on their fingers.  Right.  It's on their fingers.  It has to go somewhere.  It's got to go somewhere.  You wipe it on the ball bag, and somebody will actually watch from behind and make sure 
[01:48:30]  that they...  It'll be obvious if they're wiping it on their leg or something.  He's got to know.  But first, we got to start with Bill to see...  Bill's our test subject.  This is so gay.  What is this called in science when you have the...  Gay.  Hot.  Guinea pig?  No.  The test subject?  It's a...  Control group?  Yeah.  A control.  Thank you.  Here you go, Bill.  It's all upside for you, Bill.  All right, Bill.  Get a good... 
[01:49:00]  Oh, wow.  You can't even just...  Should we nuke it a little bit?  All the agony with no prize.  Good.  Oh, he got some.  Yeah, you could get some in there.  Get like two fingers.  You want to heat it up slightly?  Someone heat this up for like 15 seconds.  That's it.  15 seconds?  No?  That'll be blazing.  Bill, I said a little, you psycho.  That's good.  Yeah.  I'm not going to wipe it.  All right, go ahead.  Rub that on your bag there.  Put his whole fist in there like Caligula.  Wait, get...  All right, get on the mic.  Wiping some off of his fingers, though.  What's yours?  Yeah, just get a wipe. 
[01:49:30]  Get a little.  Turn around right now.  That's right.  Face that right there, inside.  That's one way.  Make fucking Travis and Derek see a bag.  Now, really wipe it on.  Wipe it on the undercarriage.  How about you got to wipe it up the back of the shaft and over the hole, too?  Okay.  And if you have any open sores, we want it wiped on that, too.  That would have been the best if we had a chick...  We planned this and had a chick come in and shave their bags and then apply Icy Hot. 
[01:50:00]  That would have been really fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  If a chick...  All right.  A little bit.  You got a little bit on your sack.  All right, Ed?  Any sensation?  He doesn't care.  Yeah.  What's it feeling like?  Icy?  Well, at first it was icy.  And then...  Eventually it's getting hotter.  Yeah, so they're going to need a bit of this.  I think you should heat it up a little and get a good, like, tablespoon.  Tablespoon?  Oh. 
[01:50:30]  And make sure they all have the correct equal measurement for each person.  And...  This is hurting a lot more than I would have thought it would.  Is it really hurting now?  What is it?  What is it?  Is it a sting or a burn?  Burn.  It's a burn.  Yeah.  Did you apply it to the underside of your bag?  Yeah.  I love that we can't get a reaction.  Nah.  It's actually...  This really sucks. 
[01:51:00]  Build rules.  I can deal with it, though.  But I think this would be a very good competition for those guys.  Ooh.  A little heated up.  Oh, look at that.  Those of us with nerve endings.  Yeah.  Those of us with a soul.  And I'm deadened by some pharmaceutical.  Wow.  And?  Yeah, this, uh...  I'm having trouble coming up with things to say right now.  I'm really concentrating on not...  Screaming?  I can deal with it, I think. 
[01:51:30]  As long as it doesn't get any worse than it is now.  Now get...  Try this.  Get a cup of water, somebody.  He's a classic, this guy.  Get a cup of water.  Two fingers.  Wet your fingers.  And then wet the area that you just rubbed on.  Why, is that going to make it worse?  Well, I don't know.  See, I don't know.  I've heard water kind of...  How about we have...  Why don't you have those guys do it, seeing how they're in the competition and I get nothing  from doing this.  Wow, that's the first time he's actually come close to saying no to something.  Do you realize you're becoming a star on this program? 
[01:52:00]  Sure.  I guess.  He's doing the pee-pee dance.  Now just try a couple of fingers first in the water.  Fingers for all you motherfuckers.  Well, we'll have the guys dip in the water, dip in the icy hot, apply.  I think the water's got to go after, though.  All right, so you apply.  Yeah, here he goes.  He's putting his wet fingers.  Jesus.  Here we go.  All right.  Who the hell is that?  Is that Grey Wolf?  Is that him? 
[01:52:30]  No, that's not Grey Wolf.  Let's move out of the way.  I don't know.  Is that Grey Wolf?  No.  Is that guy going to throw a sink through the fucking window?  Do we have a new homeless guy that's coming in?  Yeah, a new homeless guy.  Not the Grey Wolf, but another Indian fellow.  We're getting ready for the homeless shopping spree as well, and every week Keith brings in  a new homeless guy for us to interview.  What is it doing?  I put water on it.  It seems to just be stinging a lot.  I think this would be a good competition for those guys.  I mean, a jujitsu expert like Nathaniel might be able to psych out the pain, and I know Danny 
[01:53:00]  is really good at doing stuff, like crazy things.  Like with his sack.  Yeah, and so.  I don't know.  I'm just having trouble thinking on my feet right now.  I think that's great for one of them.  There's got to be two contests.  There's two different PSPs.  Yeah.  Wow.  Bill.  All right, number one.  How much did you actually put on?  You put on very little, didn't you?  Like a finger's worth. 
[01:53:30]  But it wasn't even clumped up.  It was like just spread on your finger tip.  Yeah, this guy's going to have a finger tip.  It was a bit clumped up.  I mean, I took a lot off because I had two fingers at first, and I took a bit off.  Heat this off for like 10 seconds just to get it a little softer.  Don't go nuts.  Yeah, look at the instructions first.  See if it's going to blow up the microwave.  Who cares?  That's what I love about Bill.  He's in pain right now, but he's.  That's the best reaction we're going to get out of him.  That's the same reaction he'd have if he was murdering a prostitute.  Yeah.  Just.  The same.  No.  Nothing. 
[01:54:00]  Nothing.  It's all focus.  The person that he's killing is thinking with their last thought, like, my God, how can  he just stand there like that?  He's unfeeling.  Yeah.  So unfeeling.  The head tilts like Michael Myers when he's confused.  Why is the homeless guy drinking a beer out of a Starbucks cup?  I don't know.  He's classy.  He's an Indian dude.  He certainly is an Indian.  All right.  Guy from Predator.  All right, Bill.  You can go to the bathroom if you want.  Oh, it's like the guy from Predator.  Papa was a big man.  You think it'll be a good contest? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  And these guys will have to keep applying every, what, five minutes?  Billy Bear.  That sounds about right.  Every five minutes, Ant?  Yeah.  Or what?  Yeah, all right.  Yeah.  All right, cool.  All right, thanks, Bill.  So what is the method of removal, if not water?  That's your problem.  Yeah.  Okay.  You better get some towels.  All right.  What's that static?  It might be the wireless.  It might be the wireless.  All right, why don't we take a break and we'll figure out this whole icy hot thing next,  okay? 
[01:55:00]  Good idea.  For the PSPs, for the boys.  Next time on a very special Everybody Loves Raymond, Ray goes to the doctor.  Ray, would you like to see your test results?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  What are you doing?  Ray, I'm afraid you've got AIDS.  No, come on.  You have a rare strain of HIV.  No.  Commonly found in post-op Portuguese transsexuals.  No.  The fun really begins when Ray's wife finds out.  Why is the toilet filled with bloody poo?  Come on.  Oh, my God.  The bed is full of scabs.  Hot.  But everything works out in the end. 
[01:55:30]  Sweetie, you're losing so much weight.  I bought you a smaller robe.  Hey, I'm on the air conditioner.  Ray, your mother's here.  She wants to say goodbye.  Oh, what are you doing?  All on the next Everybody Loves Raymond.  Tonight at 8.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show tip of the day on XM Radio.  If you own an 05 or 06 Ford Escape or Mercury Mariner, listen up.  Here's a factory bulletin.  Some 05 or 06 Escapes and Mariners may exhibit a single or multiple clunk or rattle noise from the front end when hitting a bump and turning into a driveway. 
[01:56:00]  The noise may be more noticeable with a hot engine and ambient temperatures.  Often the noise is mistaken for a loose suspension part or sheet metal on the vehicle's body.  The cause of the noise is an audible hydraulic pressure spike in the power steering system.  Ford has come up with a fix for this.  Replace the power steering return line with a newly designed one which contains an internal orifice to reduce line pressure spike. 
[01:56:30]  Got a question?  Check our website at americascarshow.com.  Hear the full show on XM Channel 166, Saturdays, 2 p.m. Eastern.

There's enough shows out there with all the nuts and bolts and stats and all the stuff that goes with our sport.  I want to bring in a whole totally different aspect of what goes on once those cameras shut off and everybody goes on to their normal way of life. 
[01:57:00]  So hopefully I'm going to bring something new.  Jimmy Johnson, not what you expected, an XM exclusive on NASCAR radio.  The NHL taking an Olympic break, so we have lined up an American Hockey League game for you tonight on home ice, XM 204.  7 Eastern, Manitoba will be in Grand Rapids.  Tomorrow night we have Toronto in Hamilton.

[01:58:30]  All on the next Ron and Fez.  Guests of the Ron and Fez show subject to change without notice.  Ron and Fez on XM 202.  It's the worst of the Opie and N3 show.  Okay, why don't we do the Icy Hot thing?  Please.  We got the two PSPs.  We should bring the boys in.  So Ray's going to be the spotter.  And we went with a different type of Icy Hot. 
[01:59:00]  Why did we go with the tube kind?  Because it was easier to get out than the other one.  Easier to spread.  All right, we got four guys, Anthony.  Four men.  Four young go-getters.  Men.  If you're just tuning in, we're going to do an Icy Hot contest.  And the last two guys in studio win the PSPs.  All right.  Right.  We have Danny.  Say hi, Danny.  Hi.  We have Nathaniel.  Hi.  How's it going?  We have Travis.  Hello.  Oh, Travis is so out first. 
[01:59:30]  No, I'm very confident.  You're very confident?  Why?  I just think I can handle this thing.  Someone on the phone lines saying that the guy with the most ball bag hair is going to win.  Why?  Less hits your ball bag?  You got protection.  Is it gay if I said we just had this conversation in the studio?  Oh, really?  So we kind of took that into account and have all decided that we probably don't have a big foresty bag to the point where it's going to affect this competition. 
[02:00:00]  Let's take a look.  Who would you put?  I would put in hair order.  I would put Danny, the most hair.  Then Than.  And then Lil Travis.  Yeah.  And we'll never know.  Actually, Travis has a lot of facial hair.  Yeah, he's got those bushy sideburns.  He looks so young, I bet you his hasn't even dropped yet.  It's just like a little sack.  It's empty.  Empty little sack.  All right. 
[02:00:30]  I guess Ray has to come in here for this.  Are these guys going down to their underwear?  How are we working this?  Huh?  Well, is E-Rock playing?  Yeah, E-Rock's playing.  We need to spot her.  Ooh.  A lot of aggression towards E-Rock.  Yeah, well.  Well, no one really likes E-Rock.  Why?  I don't know.  Just because of that dumb shaved face?  It's really bugging me.  I like you unshaven and messy.  Not chipper.  All right.  Well. 
[02:01:00]  Well, are we ready?  Down in your underwear, boys.  Ooh.  This is just the worst.  No, it's not a bunch of men standing in their underwear putting stuff on their balls.  It's called a contest.  It's called a contest.  And it makes me sick that you guys have fucking chicks squirting all over the place, and then  I come back, and you got these faggots in their undershorts.  I know.  It's not right.  Well, Kevin from Colorado has a good point on the phones.  Kevin?  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  Hi, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, Kevin.  How you doing, Kev?  Thanks for calling the program.  Oh, thank you.  I just wanted to say, we definitely know Jimmy's back in town, because instead of hot chicks,  you know, squirting on Big A, we got guys in the studio rubbing icey out on their ball  bag.  It ain't my choice, bro.  Believe me.  Punch it out.  All right.  Okay.  Well, we're ready to go, guys.  You want them to apply every two minutes, because we don't want to sit around for five  minutes.  Eef. 
[02:02:00]  Should we do other body parts?  Yeah, how about a dollop in the old asshole, tough guys?  How about a finger full right on the old brown eye?  Tough guys.  You want to be men.  That's what we do to be men.  You put a whole finger right up your ass with a little icy light on it.  Jimmy's energy always gets picked up to a new level when we do these weird things.  Yeah.  Well, you can hear it in your voice.  Well, dude, we were just talking before about the holiday tree, and now there's four guys  about to fucking scald their own testicles for a fucking PSP game. 
[02:02:30]  How do you not get juiced?  Steve.  Sorry.  Are they going to dip in water, too, Ant?  I think after a while.  Yeah.  It's not looking like they're suffering.  All right.  Maybe a little water in there, because I think that activates a little more.  All right.  So, what's, uh...  All right.  You give us the order, Ant.  Yeah.  Gentlemen, apply to your bags.  No.  Go ahead.  Flip it up. 
[02:03:00]  Give them a container.  All right.  Well, waiting for Eric.  You guys should do it all at the same time, because that could be key to the contest.  Let's walk, don't we?  I don't know.  He's getting a cup of water.  Oh, yeah.  You're right, because that would be whoever goes last.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They all got to do it at the same time.  Who went out and got more containers?  They're like toothpaste containers.  I do.  Oh, that's probably more easily applied.  Yeah.  That stuff goes on a lot easier.  It's like toothpaste consistency.  All right.  Who's going to dish out the Icy Hot?  There's two fingers first. 
[02:03:30]  Going on Travis's fingers.  Oh, my God.  That much?  Yeah.  It's got to be a lot.  It's got to be a lot.  It's got to be a lot.  That much.  Kev, use your hand.  Just put it on your fingers and just put it on the balls.  Make sure it's the same amount.  Is it about the same?  It's about the same.  It looks like Travis got a little more.  Yeah.  A little more for Than.  A little more for Than.  There it is.  Hold on, Danny.  Fucking all eager.  Danny.  Little.  Oh, Danny's got a lot.  All right.  Ray.  Ray, the intern, has to kind of make sure they're actually applying. 
[02:04:00]  No cheating.  Yeah, don't cheat, man.  Don't cheat.  Now, that's got to be wiped, and you've got to kind of rub it in a little bit, guys.  Don't just leave it there as a swipe.  You've got to get your, I think you've got to get the palm of your hand involved.  Once you wipe it on your bag, give it like a rant, rant, like you're shining a doorknob,  and then you'll be done.  Yes.  This is for the PSP, remember.  Make sure you massage those balls good. 
[02:04:30]  That's right.  Rub it in there.  That's good ones.  What exactly is Ray Lee?  Make believe you're throwing a spitball.  I'm looking at it when we're doing this.  What?  He's kind of just making sure your hands are in the right spot.  Yeah.  Your fingers are not wiping it on your thigh.  He wants to make sure you're going inside your underwear.  Yeah.  You're not wiping it on your underwear.  Right.  Or you're, you know, you're not wiping it on your side as you're trying to fake it.  That's right.  No cheat.  If we find out you're cheating, be angry.  Then Jimmy's going to paddle you.  That's right. 
[02:05:00]  You get a good paddling.  You did say you will paddle if they were bad.  Yes, Travis?  If we're all doing it at the same time, how's Ray going to watch all of us?  Well, Kevin will be watching, too.  Look, why?  Are you saying that you're going to cheat?  No, I'm definitely not.  Oh, then who are you thinking is going to cheat?  Eric is going to cheat.  They all think Eric's going to cheat.  I think Eric's going to cheat, too.  Me, too.  Who do you guys don't trust in the contest?  Who's going to cheat?  Everyone's playing Eric.  They hate Eric.  Because you cheated to win $100,000.  Exactly.  Eric, don't worry.  It's okay to be hated.  You're already mushing it around in your hand to try to activate it. 
[02:05:30]  I'm working up a good lather.  All right.  He's activating it.  All right.  Drop the mic and apply, I guess.  Apply to your bags.  Get those bags out, studs.  Fucking hot chicks are not here.  I get these.  Look at what you get.  And Steve is videotaping, so.  You're going to have to maybe through the top.  I don't know what Dan's doing.  He's going to try to get it through his fly.  You have to because you're going to rub it over the helmet the other way.  No, you've got to get it through the top of your pants, I think.  No way.  You get the balls out the bottom. 
[02:06:00]  You never get it in there.  You take your balls out the bottom.  Would you actually go?  Do you want to go over your fucking shaft and helmet with that stuff on your hands?  If you pull your underwear and pants away from you far enough, you're going to be able to get in there.  That's what you guys got to do.  Danny just doesn't care.  Danny's got his pants open.  And then just, yeah, get it on there.  All right.  Whenever you want to look.  Whenever you guys are ready.  I'm trying not to, but I want to make sure you're not fucking cheating.  Yeah, sure.  That's what you're doing.  Are we doing this on my head?  Yeah.  All right.  Are we ready to apply?  And we need to rub it in and just. 
[02:06:30]  Well, just give it a nice.  Just give it a good.  Wipe on.  So it's on there good.  Not like hanging off your sack.  All right.  All off your head.  In 10 seconds.  Yeah, get it all off your head.  All right.  Get it all off your head.  Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.  Apply.  Contest on.  Oh, jeez.  Can't wait until later when Jimmy's upper lip smells like icy hot.  Now, wait a minute.  I don't like that implication.  All right. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  It looks like they're rubbing.  That looked pretty.  All right.  Travis has come.  They all have come out with an empty hand.  Their hands are pretty, pretty clean.  All right.  Is it icy yet, guys?  It's hot.  It's getting hot already?  All right.  Let's get some mics over there.  Yeah.  Kevin, why don't you work the mics for us, please?  Big Cav or Steve.  What are you feeling?  Oh, fuck.  Burning sensation.  Burning sensation. 
[02:07:30]  On the bag.  Holy shit out of that.  Ray, open the door.  Wow.  Hawk is really having a tough time.  He's turning red.  Hawk.  It's burning.  I'm going to pee myself.  Yeah.  It almost feels like you've already pissed your pants.  Oh, look at Travis.  He's scratching the back of his neck.  I might have to tap out.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  They're all doing the pee-pee dance.  They're all like.  All right.  The icy hot has been on for one minute at this time. 
[02:08:00]  Who wants to tap out, man?  That bathroom's waiting.  You can wipe it down and.  Paper towel.  Is it really that bad?  It's burning.  It's awful.  Hawk is hyperventilating.  Why don't you act like men?  Travis is spinning in circles.  Yeah.  Get a mic on.  Travis, what's up?  I'm just trying not to think about it.  What?  The fucking agony on your bag right now?  You guys talk.  Wow.  Danny, I've never seen him look like that.  Danny's focused.  He's really trying to.  Danny's trying to go into his own. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Trying to not think about this.  Eric's shaking, too, now.  They don't want to talk.  It hurts so much.  What does it feel like, Eric?  Does it feel like the beard stubble of an uncle?  Eric?  It feels like there's a lighter right under you.  That bad.  It's burning.  Wow.  Holy crap.  Look at these guys.  They're losing their minds.  Travis, you all right?  Just say something for the radio audience.  I'm good. 
[02:09:00]  All right.  It smells so minty in here.  Nathaniel?  Dying.  Nathaniel's dying.  Who's going to tap out?  Who's tapping out?  Who's tapping out?  A minute.  Oh, yeah.  We got to start applying more.  I like five.  Huh?  Five?  Five minutes?  No, not yet.  No, this is for one.  Travis is like, not yet.  Not yet.  Oh, wait.  What?  I'm getting all tingling and passing out feeling.  Oh, no.  Travis is out.  Have somebody assist him so he doesn't just fall on the bathroom floor. 
[02:09:30]  Have somebody fucking hide the paper towels in there.  Just make sure.  He said he was feeling like he was tingling and ready to pass out.  He did not like that at all, man.  No.  He was having a really tough time.  Steve is videotaping this.  We just need one guy to drop out and the other two get the PSP.  Sam looks a little pale.  Dan, how you doing over there?  Danny's being quiet.  All right.  He's using the Master Poe thing.  Yeah.  Are you taking your pulse?  He's squeezing his...  Eric? 
[02:10:00]  Oh, moving sucks.  Moving sucks.  They're trying to stay still.  The dance stinks.  Huh?  Dancing around does not help.  Well, that was a good thing you told us because you know what the next step is?  Jumping jacks.  A little exercise.  A little running in place.  Just fucking tap out, pussy, so we can get these fucking things right.  He's an animal.  Danny is an animal.  Danny is doing okay.  Yeah, Danny's not doing bad at all.  Eric, why are you suffering?  Look at Danny.  Danny's not going anywhere.  It's very obvious.  Come on, money bags.  Tap out. 
[02:10:30]  Stick it out.  Stick it out, Hawk.  You can do it.  All right.  Don't let these two...  Fuck, they're trying to punk you because you're rich and spoiled and had a great...  You guys now, 10 squats.  10 squats.  You've got to go down, bend at the knee, all the way down, and then back up all at the  same time.  Or do we go with another dollop?  Well, 10 squats first.  Yeah, a couple of squats.  See if when they're moving, it really hurts.  All right, ready?  Ready?  Count them out.  All right.  Ready and down.  One. 
[02:11:00]  Two.  Two.  Come on down.  Three.  Four.  Four.  Five.  Get lower.  Get lower, Danny.  Get down there, Danny.  Six.  Get up, down.  That's right.  Squat, guys.  Seven.  Eight.  Move faster, Hawk.  Hawk is one behind.  Nine.  Hawk's doing real squats, though.  Ten.  All right.  There you go.  God, do I miss Los Angeles.  One more for Hawk.  Any difference? 
[02:11:30]  Hawk?  You still hurting?  Activated it nicely.  Hawk is really having a hard time.  Nathaniel?  I'm somewhere else right now.  All right.  Fingers, please.  It's time for another dollop.  Danny?  Fuck.  This is the worst thing I've ever done.  Danny?  Yes.  How you feeling?  It sucks, dude.  All right.  It's pretty tough.  Mars, how is it?  It's pretty tough.  Did you see Travis?  No.  Can we do a smaller dollop?  Yeah, smaller dollop's all right.  That was fucking tough.  Yeah.  All right.  Eric?  It's spreading. 
[02:12:00]  It's spreading?  This is going to knock Eric out right here, I think.  I don't know.  Eric's doing better than people expected him to do.  He's hyperventilating.  Don't breathe so heavy.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess it's time to apply the next dollop of Icy Hot.  Now, you'll be really inclined to cheat right now, I'm sure.  But do not, or you will be disqualified.  That's right.  We have monitors here watching you.  Eric looks like he's ready to cry.  All right.  He's fine.  I'm ready.  All right.  Ready?  He's not.  He's cheating.  He's not cheating.  I haven't done anything.  I got faith in you, Hawk. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, let's go, Hawk.  Wipe that bag.  Wipe that bag.  Oh, my God.  Get in there.  There it is.  All right.  Second coat.  Oh, does it just touch it?  It's cold.  There you go.  Scrotum's in my rib cage already.  Oh, wow.  Oh, Danny's having a hard time.  Eric is out.  That'll cool it off.  Eric is out.  Wow.  All right.  Danny's in another place.  Eric's not out of the contest.  He just, his fingers are.  See, this is nice. 
[02:13:00]  This is the calm before the storm.  I think the icy is coming back in.  And then it gets hot again.  Yep.  And here it is.  Right now.  Uh-oh.  Is it heating up?  Okay.  He didn't cheat.  His timing is perfect.  Perfect.  Yeah.  All right.  So now it's, Hawk, say something.  It's burning.  It's tingling.  I think maybe some jumping jacks would be good.  Shut up, Fan.  Wow.  Fan is really, uh...  Go get her.  Yeah.  He's, uh, he's hanging in there.  Danny's having a tough time. 
[02:13:30]  He's doing some deep breathing exercises right now.  Yeah.  Never intended to procreate anyway, so it's fine.  And Eric just wiped his eye.  That's real smart, Eric.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I think, okay.  Uh, jumping jacks.  Ready?  Yeah, hold your pants up.  One arm jumping jacks.  That's right.  Those are hotter anyway.  Let's get jumping.  Make sure you do it high and, uh, open those legs up and then close them again.  This is impossible, jumping jacks.  Ready?  And...  Exercise.  One, go.  One, two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. 
[02:14:00]  Very good.  All right.  Oh, Danny, that kind of hurt.  Danny, what happened?  What is that doing?  Is it unpleasant?  My balls.  That just about sums it up.  My balls, indeed.  My jeans.  What's that, Dan?  Uh-oh.  Push the side of my jeans.  Danny might be out.  Danny might be out.  Yeah, Danny can't let...  He won't let Eric beat him.  Bring in the cheese grater. 
[02:14:30]  That's right.  All right.  Go get the bag of marshmallows.  They're having a hard time.  See, they don't want to let Eric beat him, and Eric doesn't want to lose because he knows  he was expected to lose.  I know.  This is a great...  Well, he didn't lose.  This is a great contest because Eric doesn't want these guys showing him up at all.  Nope.  Eric, how are you feeling?  Oh, well.  You're ready to tap out, aren't you?  I'll do some more.  Oh, Hawk's ready to do some more. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, wow.  I wonder how the water will do.  It will help it.  That'll activate it or help it?  It'll relax them.  Yeah?  Yeah, it'll relax them a little bit.  Put some water on there.  Danny?  Put a little water.  Eric's cheating.  I don't think that's really icy hot on his fingers.  You want to take a look, Danny?  Go ahead.  You want to take a look?  Those are fighting words.  Nathaniel?  What?  I don't want to look at you.  Oh, your mic's off now.  Oh, that mic ain't working.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Anything?  Anything, Tad? 
[02:15:30]  I don't know.  Is it calming down now?  I just can't.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's calmed down.  It's not about E-Rock.  E-Rock?  Oh, E-Rock's not tapping out.  He said no.  I don't think he's cheating.  E-Rock, why don't you get health insurance?  Come on.  All right, more.  How's Game Boy?  How's Travis doing, by the way?  More icy hot.  Here we go for round three.  Where's Travis?  In the bathroom.  Oh, good.  He's all right?  He's got his ball bag in the sink.  I just want to see who walks in to wash their hands. 
[02:16:00]  See these four creeps and their scrotums.  He's got his nuts in the sink.  Because at that point, you'll just throw your ball bag in the sink.  You don't care who sees.  All right, ready for round three?  Wait, Dan, you don't want to talk into the mic?  No, I just don't want it in my face.  All right.  All right.  Well, it's called radio.  Yeah, it's called radio.  Yeah, we got to entertain stuff.  Talk loudly.  He's starting to lose it.  Yeah, we got to entertain the people, too.  He's getting a little...  All right, here we go for round three.  Here it is.  Another application.  Guys, let it rip.  Apply to those balls there. 
[02:16:30]  There they go.  You can do it.  Is it hurt to even just touch it?  Not when you put it back on.  No.  No, it's kind of numb.  Hey, Travis.  Travis is back.  Oh, Travis.  All right.  That's the most pain I've ever been in.  Wait, get Travis on my...  Look at Travis sweating like crazy.  It's still not off.  I don't know how you get it off, but you just got to sit still.  Did they get it?  Danny had some left.  I had some sneak away between my fingers.  There it is.  Okay. 
[02:17:00]  Travis is sweating like he just pitched an idea in a meeting.  Wow.  He's sitting there with his legs spread on the seat.  He can't take it.  These guys are up to their third round, and they're fighting it.  Wow, Danny.  You all right, Danny?  Fine.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Just when you think it's gone away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hawk, how you doing?  It's a fucking burn.  Does it hurt?  Oh, yeah.  Wait, go back to Eric. 
[02:17:30]  He's having a really tough time.  It's all about Eric right now.  Listen in.  Because it spread on my thighs, too.  Yeah.  Listen to the breathing.  Dan?  Can I have a beer?  All right.  Now, here's a little leg.  Put your legs together so your feet and knees are touching.  Ankles touch.  Go ahead.  Ankles touch.  No, make them touch.  Ankles touch.  Ankles touch.  Okay. 
[02:18:00]  Now, twist at the hips.  Oh, look at Eric.  Back and forth.  Twist at the hips.  Twist at the hips.  Further.  Further.  Twist at the hips.  Oh, my God.  Hawk, twist at the hips.  Twist at the hips.  Ow.  Get down, fucker.  Go down.  Go down.  Go down.  Eric is staggering.  Twist at the hips.  Twist at the hips.  Twist at the hips.  Not at the knees.  Twist at the hips. 
[02:18:30]  Eric is staggering.  He stinks.  All right.  There you go.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Wow.  Did it hurt, Finn?  That really must have hurt.  What do you mean?  I'm a relative.  Eric?  Can I separate, or do I still got to stand like this?  Stand with them together.  Yeah, they got to stay together now.  Good idea, Ant.  Knees together, Dan.  I think, yeah, Danny.  Ant's not Italian.  He's definitely German.  Hey, you're a cowboy.  Put your knees together.  You're a sick fuck.  Oh, are they having a tough time?  All right.  Hawks, look how rosy red Hawks' cheeks are. 
[02:19:00]  It's kind of nice, actually.  It's hyperventilating.  Wow, look at Danny.  Danny looks like he's going to kill somebody.  Danny, you all right?  Fine.  This is great, because there's a whole thing going on here.  Like, these guys.  Oh, the competition between these guys.  Yeah, the competition between the rest of the gang and Eric is always there.  Always there.  The next exercise is knees to the chest.  Knees to the chest.  With legs completely together.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:19:30]  My arms are actually, I can feel them going numb like they're tingly.  How you doing, Eric?  My crotch is burning so bad.  You better tap out.  I don't know.  I think Hawkeye.  I would tap out.  You better tap out, have everyone laugh at you, and then you can wipe off.  Don't tap out.  For the rest of the fucking, of the day, they're going to know their balls had a little bit  more temerity than your balls.  Well, someone's suggesting they run in place.  High-stepping.  High-stepping place.  High-stepping.  It's either that or another dollop.  What do you guys think?  High-stepping.  All right.  All right.  Get over there, Eric. 
[02:20:00]  Move over a little bit, guys.  Yeah, so you're in line with each other.  Watch your head on the TV.  You can button up so you can high-step without your pants falling down.  Yeah.  Button up, boys.  A little high-step and a little knees up.  Very nice and minty in here.  Yeah.  Isn't it?  It's wonderful.  It certainly is.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Travis, you still burning over there?  I'm going to wipe the hands off.  He's all mad, Kev.  Come off the towel.  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Danny's just pissed.  Danny's just a fucking crank. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Danny will do anything not to lose this contest.  Oh, man.  All right.  What do you want him to do?  High-step for 15 seconds?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do we have to hot-turn?  Yeah.  Get your hands in front of you.  It should be high.  Yeah.  As high as you can.  It should be a high-high-step.  In four, three, two, one.  Run in place and high-step.  Go!  High-step.  There it is.  Oh, Jesus.  This is for the PSPs.  We've got two and three contestants left.  Oh, Eric.  Oh, God, I heard.  Get him up there.  Hawk is high-stepping.  Hawk is high-stepping. 
[02:21:00]  Danny's high.  Everyone's high-stepping pretty good.  And stop.  There you go.  Eric.  How's that?  Oh, shit.  It rejuvenates the feeling.  Yeah.  I think Nathaniel's not going to tap out.  I think it's between Danny and Eric.  No, Danny is really being a trooper about this.  Eric.  More.  Wow.  You asked for it.  He'll take more.  Yeah.  All right, here comes the big dollop.  Here's a big dollop.  Here comes the showstopper.  Big Kev, apply. 
[02:21:30]  What do you think?  We sneak some back to the crack?  No?  All right, that's good.  That's a good big dollop.  That's a bit much.  That was too much.  It's got to be the big dollop.  Holy shit.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  Dude, we're almost done with the tube.  Get it in there.  Just to make sure.  The tube is well.  He has way less than I do.  I'm sorry.  All right, give him.  That's okay.  You're allowed.  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  Fan, a little more.  There it is.  All right.  You're just going to keep getting more and more people.  You know what's going to happen?  It's going to be fucking 11 o'clock, and we're just going to be here with burning balls. 
[02:22:00]  I don't know about that.  You got two hours.  Believe me, you ain't going to make it two hours.  Yeah, we're going armpits next.  And Travis actually has a suggestion.  He said, sit Indian style.  Now that he's out, he knows all the stuff that would have hurt.  Yeah, look at Travis sitting there all relaxed.  Travis is going to get his fucking neck broken.  Look at the sweat coming from Travis.  Yeah, I think now that they're a little sweaty, though, you go armpits next.  I agree.  Armpits next.  That'll hurt.  All right.  Here we go.  Guys.  Hold on.  Come on.  Reapply. 
[02:22:30]  Danny, why are you holding keys?  I'm not ready.  Sorry.  They fell out of my pocket, little Jimmy.  All right, here we go.  They're applying.  Don't get on Danny.  He was holding keys.  He's going to kill you.  I didn't know why he was holding keys.  I just asked him.  I didn't yell.  Stab you in the neck with them is what he's going to do.  It's understandable.  He's angry.  All right, here we go.  Jesus Christ.  Here we go.  We got the two PSPs, Anthony.  Three contestants left.  This is fucking ridiculous.  One guy.  Fucking A.  One guy bails, and the other two guys will get the PSPs.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[02:23:00]  Start applying.  Let it rip.  Get it.  Get a good one.  Get it right down there.  But, Kev, make sure they're doing it.  Right under.  Spread it around that sack.  What a shock.  Fucking Steve the Sadist writes, helmet, question mark.  Oh, wow.  Fucking creep.  Is it getting, is it getting onto your junk at all?  Yeah, I'm trying to, I almost got the fucking cock head.  Oh, wow.  That would hurt.  Way to keep it fun, Steve.  Let's scar them for life.  Ah, shit.  Wait.  Wow.  Uh-oh.  A little moved.  Penalty for this application.  Get it in there. 
[02:23:30]  Come on.  Get it in there.  Get it in there.  Yeah, you're all done.  Nathaniel's done.  Eric's done.  Danny is now.  All right.  Danny got it.  Danny's done.  There it is.  They're enjoying that very quick moment of icy.  Ah, the icy.  Before it turns hot.  Oh, fuck.  And I believe it's turning hot.  Underpants budget.  Yeah, you need some new drawers there, huh?  Someone is suggesting that we make them teabag the jar. 
[02:24:00]  Another paper towel for it.  Very good, Danny.  As they buckle up.  It'll be the fucking thing.  How do you think a rubber band against a ball bag would be?  Ow.  Now, guys, after you buckle up, pants or whatever you're doing, again, legs together.  Touching.  Hawk touching.  Yeah, at the knees.  Yeah, the legs together.  Ankles together.  Ankles and knees together.  The legs together seems to work.  Stand at attention.  Wow.  Hawk is now bull-legged.  Come on there, Hawk.  Come on.  Ankles together. 
[02:24:30]  There you go.  All right.  Ankles together.  Nathaniel's doing good.  Yeah.  Unless he's playing possum.  You never know.  And all you guys.  And touch your toes.  Go ahead.  Without bending your knees.  There you go.  And touch your toes.  One more time.  Give those toes a little touch.  And touch your toes.  There's one more.  Oh, Hawk almost fell over.  Hawk fell backwards.  Yes, he is crying.  Danny is losing it. 
[02:25:00]  Hawk.  Yes.  Uh-oh.  Absolutely.  Oh, it just kind of, that kind of got it onto their junk, I think.  Hawk.  Mine's sliding into the back.  Oh, great.  Up your ass.  Are you cracking?  Hawk, stand up straight.  You're bending over.  Stand up straight.  I think one more toe touch, Ant.  I mean, that's just my opinion.  And one more toe touch, Ant.  Down to the toes.  Keep those knees locked.  There you go.  Stand back up.  Stand up straight. 
[02:25:30]  Eric.  Eric.  Up burns.  Stand up straight.  Uh-oh.  Eric might be out.  No, he's not.  He's staggering.  They all expect him to be out.  He's staggering.  All right.  You know what exercise I used to love as a kid because it was so much fun?  Which one, Ant?  When you get on your back, hold your hips up and do the bicycle in the air.  Bicycle.  Bicycle, guys.  Bicycle in the air.  It's fun.  It's bicycle time.  Now, get on your backs.  Ed, you're a sadistic.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  It's nice. 
[02:26:00]  Who knew he added in them?  Yeah.  Why don't you get them all pregnant and sew their legs together?  Get on the backs.  This will make some drip into the ass crack.  That's right.  Now, hold your hips up and get your legs in the air.  And now pedal like a bicycle.  Wait.  Danny might be out.  Come on, Danny.  Danny, you're not on your bicycle.  Look at Hawk.  Hawk's pedaling away, Danny.  Hawk's pedaling.  Hawk is pedaling.  I don't see Danny pedaling much.  Danny might be out. 
[02:26:30]  I'm going.  All right.  Danny's going.  Danny's pedaling.  What?  I'm going.  He's going.  Going or gone?  No, I'm going.  That's in my legs.  Oh, he's going.  All right.  All right.  Well, they're doing a good job.  All right.  That's enough of that exercise.  All right.  Back up.  Back up.  I don't want to have it leak into their ass.  Does he?  Hold on.  Fucking Master Paul has a suggestion.  Po?  Oh, Po.  Master Paul.  You okay?  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on a minute.  Eric, you all right?  Eric?  Yeah, I'm all right.  I think the exercise is what's killing Eric. 
[02:27:00]  That's right.  All that mayo.  That's right.  Okay, guys.  He's just smearing mayo on his balls.  Fucking meat arteries.  Master Paul is going to help out.  Help the situation.  All right, guys.  Slowly, I'd like for you to lift up your knee in the air.  Yeah.  And then I want you to bring your knee to the left.  Oh.  That's a good idea, Po.  Bring it to the right.  Po, don't you have a homeless guy going to need secure help?  All right.  One knee up.  One knee up.  You can balance yourself.  As high as your belly button.  So it's like a 90-degree angle. 
[02:27:30]  There you go.  And now over to the side there.  There you go.  And then to the right.  You're not turning your...  He's pivoting on his ankle.  Don't...  What am I doing wrong?  You're pivoting on your ankle.  You're supposed to move your leg over.  You're moving your leg.  Look.  You're not death of a swan, you homo.  Fucking...  You're leaving your foot right where it is, and then you bring it to the left and then  to the right.  Oh.  To the left and then to the right.  You don't pivot, though.  The one leg stays straight.  All right.  A lot of people are suggesting the armpit now that they have exercised. 
[02:28:00]  You guys get the choice of one armpit.  That's right.  You have to keep on going, guys.  No, they're done with that.  Okay.  All right.  We're going armpit.  Eric, take off that sweater.  You got a t-shirt underneath, right?  Yes.  I don't want to ruin your shirt.  Oh, please.  A big dollop to the armpit.  Dave, exercise.  This could be brutal.  A lot of people suggesting this.  It's going to burn?  Really?  A lot of people suggesting this.  Yes.  That'll burn?  I'm sure it will.  Yeah, now they've got to concentrate on two areas.  It could really mess them up.  Wow. 
[02:28:30]  Danny, look.  You're not going to kill one of us, Danny, after this, are you?  Uh, let's see.  Yeah.  All right.  This could be the showstopper.  Look at Eric.  Eric is going from rosy red to pale.  You've got to give Eric a lot of credit.  No one thought he would hang in this long.  Can I just request some help with rolling up a sleeve, please?  All right.  He's going under.  All right.  Are you going under?  Yeah.  Sure.  All right.  Ready?  And, uh, yeah.  Apply.  Apply. 
[02:29:00]  Look at Danny.  Oh, look at that.  He's rubbing it in.  Rub it in.  Rub it in.  There they go.  Yeah.  Than ain't going to cheat.  Holy crap.  Danny looks like LL Cool J from the MTV Video Musical.  They always show that clip.  The fucking white.  Yeah.  Put that on.  There you go.  All right.  Right now, it's nice and cool.  Now, yeah.  And what are we thinking? 
[02:29:30]  Is it burning yet?  Starting to warm up.  Starting to warm up, Eric?  Look at these ideas coming in.  Go with the upper lip.  Put some behind their knees.  Have them blow each other.  That's to celebrate the victory.  Eric?  Starting to burn.  Starting to burn, Eric.  Okay.  And?  Danny?  I mean...  It's nice.  Taking your mind off the nuts.  It's not your balls.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  All right.  We'll go back to the balls.  No, I mean, not that I was complaining.  All right.  Well, if you want to go back to the balls. 
[02:30:00]  Behind the knees.  Why?  Would that hurt?  No.  Eric?  It's hot as hell.  Other pit.  All right.  We already all...  Do the other pit.  I was just going to say, we already all think you're gay, so if you tap out now, it's not  like we'll think differently.  Oh, shit.  You're going home without a PSP, so it doesn't matter.  Ooh.  Ooh.  All right.  Wow.  All right.  We've got to figure out how to decide this, huh?  Yeah.  I say no one gets it.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Why don't we just do a fifth-caller thing and give it to a listener?  All right.  Back to the balls.  It's kind of taking their mind off of the nuts.  Well, this will be the end of the first tube of Icy Hot, by the way, just about.  How can they fit so much Icy Hot down their pants like that?  I don't know.  You know, honestly, after that last dollop, I don't even think applying more to the balls  is even going to do anything.  Really?  Reverse psychology.  Put more on.  All right.  Do that.  We'll see how that works out. 
[02:31:00]  And then splash a little water on there.  And if that doesn't work, we'll splash a little Old Spice.  Yeah.  We could have them just rub their eyes.  Oh, God, no.  You insane.  That's right.  They're blind and can't play the game.  They're going to run across 57th Street.  Bittersweet.  Huh?  My butt just fell off my pants.  Oh, did it?  Pick it up.  He's got to bend down and pick up part of his pants. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  Here we go.  Let's apply again the Icy Hot to the balls.  Ooh, that's reactivated.  Not dead.  Yeah.  All right.  We might have to go with pine cones up the ass.  Take some football camp advice.  We doing this?  Yeah, let it rip.  All right.  Oh, my goodness.  What?  What's the deal, Danny?  My balls feel like oatmeal.  Oatmeal?  Nathaniel?  It's just a mushy mess.  Nathaniel?  Yeah.  It's more of the same uncomfortable awfulness. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  And Travis was in there for maybe 30 seconds.  You really tapped out.  You know how some got in his vagina, so he had to tap really.  Wow, Danny scores.  All right.  What other exercises?  What was the one exercise that really got him?  Knees together.  Yeah, anything with the knees together.  And then bending down.  Bending down at the knees.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, it's back.  What, Danny?  I thought you said there was no feeling down there.  Oh, wow. 
[02:32:30]  I think I'm just...  Uh-oh.  He might have got the shaft.  Danny, what's going on?  I just got like one of those waves.  You know, like one of those...  That heat wave that you get.  Yeah, like a hot flag.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And the hawk is feeling a little uncomfortable.  Wait, how about this?  You've got to stand straight up with your legs together,  and you've got to take one foot and cross it over the other foot.  Oh, yeah.  Cross your feet.  Yeah.  Legs together.  Legs together.  Yeah, cross your feet so you're standing...  No, Eric, look at me.  Yeah, the hawk's right so far. 
[02:33:00]  There you go.  There you go.  And just stay like that.  There you go.  Just stay like that.  Yeah.  Go, Danny.  Put it all the way over.  That's a good idea, Jim.  Eric, let's go back to Eric.  He's having a problem.  Don't give up, Eric.  You all right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of stings.  Good luck rubbing this stuff off.  And with legs crossed, touch the toes.  Here we go.  Yay, touch the toes.  Touch the toes.  Get as close as you can.  Get as close as you can get. 
[02:33:30]  Back up.  Eric?  I have an idea.  How about doing splits?  That might relieve the pain, though.  Oh, no.  I don't think I can basically do a split.  What?  I can't do a split.  Yeah, he can't do a split.  How about they just...  We're dealing with your cheerleaders.  How about they just...  It's the whole area.  How about they just lay on their bellies?  It might spread things out a little bit.  Yes.  Hmm.  Yes, good idea.  Do the caterpillar.  Yeah, you lay on your belly and you pump. 
[02:34:00]  Eric?  No problem, right?  I'll do it.  Danny?  I'm just going to have to.  Yep.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I think if you're going to do that, you might as well...  From the outside of their pants, just grab their sack and jiggle.  Yeah, we could do that.  You know?  If the floor is supposed to do something, I think...  All right.  If they just, you know...  How about punches to the ball bag? 
[02:34:30]  Eric?  You know, you ever see Full Metal Jacket?  Where they're marching around?  Ah, this is my rifle.  This is my gun.  This is my gun.  You know, you got to kind of just grab like that and jiggle.  $300, man, for this thing.  Wow.  They don't want to do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  All right, go ahead.  Just grab a hole of your sack from outside your pants and, yeah, and just kind of scratch 
[02:35:00]  a little and...  Give it a good squeeze.  Dig in like you got the crabs or something.  Dig in there.  That's all right.  Trust me, it makes it work.  Shut up, Kevin.  I'm afraid of you.  Shut up, Kevin.  There we go.  Oh, they're itching real good now.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  All right.  Jesus H. Christ.  I think he's been hard on it.  Eric? 
[02:35:30]  It's burning.  I got an idea.  I mean, I say they take a cup of water now and pour it down the front of their pants.  It'll activate everything.  Yeah.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  We got to get one more.  Let me see your war face.  Sir, you got a war face?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  Ah!  I don't know.  Eric, do your war face.  I can't do a war face.  No, it's a scream. 
[02:36:00]  Ah!  That just fucked our audience up.  Yeah, well.  Should we do the cup of water?  Or just take your hand of water, because it's cold out.  Yeah.  Take your hand of the water.  Rub it in there.  And rub your whole ball bag in the area.  Rub your bag with some nice water.  That ought to help.  I think if you just open up the underwear and pour it in, though, it's going to start dripping  everywhere.  You think?  He's got to go home.  Yeah, he's got to go home.  Just get a cup of a palm full of water and rub it on there.  Get under the balls.  Get a good one.  In the grurn. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, wait.  Danny?  Hey, feeling?  All right?  I'm really glad I took a dump before this contest.  Ew.  Your days of finger-banging old Mary Jane Rottencrotch through her pretty pink panties  are over.  All right, guys.  All right.  Palm full of water.  Sorry.  Well, we kind of all have to do it pretty quick.  I'll agree.  At the same time. 
[02:37:00]  How exactly are we doing this just so I get this straight?  You take water.  You get your hand all wet.  All wet.  And you cup your balls and just rub under the ball bag.  There you go.  You don't need to put your cup down, then.  What have we got here, fucking comedian?  All right.  Here we go.  Now they're going with water.  They're in a lot of pain.  Well.  No shit.  No shit.  Well, thanks, Dan.  As much of our hands as we can get, right?  Yeah.  Your whole hand get wet.  You can bend your hand, too.  There you go.  Perfect.  But Daniel's got that giant hand. 
[02:37:30]  He really does.  Not a giant.  Not a giant.  I'm not a giant.  All right.  All right.  Ready, set, go.  Under the balls.  Under the balls.  There you go.  Now push back towards the crack.  Yeah.  Peace.  All right.  A little water.  My body kind of needed this anyway.  Yeah.  Might be refreshing.  We don't know.  That's right.  Cool.  I think it's refreshing, right?  Eric?  It's not hurting yet.  All right.  Well, good.  There you go.  We gave you a little help there. 
[02:38:00]  Danny might tend to disagree.  Danny?  It fucking hurts, bro.  Danny's having a problem.  It hurts.  Eric?  His nutsack is probably very chafed.  It's starting.  Eric?  Now cross your legs again.  Yeah, cross your legs again.  Cross them legs.  Cross your legs, Danny.  Ooh.  Uh-oh.  This is going to end with a fight.  You watch.  There is no racial bigotry here.  I do not look down on miggers, kites, wafts, or greasers. 
[02:38:30]  Danny Puffin and Puffin having a hard time there.  Eric?  Eric grabbing for a paper towel.  It's burning.  It's burning?  Guys.  Is it burning worse?  We all know what's next, unfortunately.  Yeah.  We all know that a little finger in the dollop between the old asshole is next.  It's either that or the wiffle bat.  How about both of them? 
[02:39:00]  Oh, Jesus.  They can't.  They're not.  They don't even.  Look at them.  They can't do that.  Eric?  I'll do more.  Danny?  Uh-oh.  Danny threw his arms up in disgust.  Danny's like, come on.  Just tap out.  We won 100,000.  Danny?  You know, I mean, I'm down for it.  It's probably getting close.  Yeah.  It's probably getting close. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, it's getting close.  That's bad.  I'm fine.  That's fine.  He is.  My leg is cramping up.  The front of the pants are getting wet.  All right.  Any other suggestions there, Anthony?  Danny's getting close, so.  Yeah, I know.  I think the water really did it.  I say wet your hand, icy hot combination, right? 
[02:40:00]  Like a watered-down version of the icy hot?  Wet hand and icy hot.  We're on the second tube of icy hot, by the way.  All right.  I've never seen more instant feedback in my life.  Just wet your hand a little bit.  A little icy hot in there.  Yeah, dunk the hands.  Yeah, it doesn't have to be soaked, but.  Dunk the hands nice.  A little icy hot.  I think I had a big dollop.  Oh, my God.  Nice size.  Yeah, as big as the last one, I guess.  Yeah, a nice size dollop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A rack of it. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  Oh, Christ.  It's dripping down my leg.  All right.  Eric.  Eric is not going to tap out.  There's a lot to prove here.  Yep.  All right.  Here we go.  Apply.  Jesus.  Apply.  I guess too.  Talk to you guys.  Here we go.  And they're applying once again with a wet hand filled with icy hot.  Oh, my God.  Get back there. 
[02:41:00]  I need more surface area.  You probably don't want to say that to a national audience that you need more surface area.  Well, stuff tends to retreat when you're putting ice on all over it.  Keith had a good idea.  What about a little on the nipple?  On the nipple?  Why the nipple?  It's a sensitive area.  Try it.  Let's see how this works out first.  Yeah, let's see.  What's going on?  It's a little icy right now, right?  A little icy?  It's hot.  It's hot?  Yeah, it's getting hot.  The armpit's still burning. 
[02:41:30]  Armpit's still burning?  Okay.  Hmm.  I can't think of any more sick, cruel things.  Dude.  Trying to.  I'm telling you, the fucking, the ass cheeks are the fucking, that's the deal.  The, uh.  Might have to be the tiebreaker.  Of course it is.  The feedback is ridiculous.  Chris from Long Island.  E-Rock hasn't wanted anything this much since the last time Hellman's released its new line  of mayo.  Shit.  Shit tooth from Long Island.  Just tuned in.  Are you guys doing a live version of Rent Boys? 
[02:42:00]  Shit.  Shit.  Someone suggesting they should do the, uh, the Silence of the Lambs talk.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  I already did that at the Halloween party.  Bill from Waterford.  How much of a pussy is Travis now?  Yeah.  A lot of people suggest that they get some on their taint.  Well, it's already there.  It drips in. 
[02:42:30]  It is well in there.  This is gayer than a, uh, Andy Dick hot tub party.  Oh, that's my brother from Southall.  Very good, Scott.  So, Dan, what are you going to play tonight?  Your brand new PSP or your brand new Xbox 360?  Which is being delivered today.  Hopefully both, Danny.  Oh.  What else can we do?  Let's try.  The cheeks.  I did.  The cheeks.  Gotta go between the cheeks.  I'm just gonna make sure that is accomplished.  If you, if you, you take it and you put it down between, you can see them rub it. 
[02:43:00]  Believe me.  I, I rubbed toothpaste in my asshole when I was young once because I thought it would cool  me off.  I gotta tell you, as gay as this sounds, I've never seen more instant feedback in my life.  Yeah, uh, people.  No one is going anywhere.  Going nuts.  They want to, because there's some bragging rights here.  Yeah.  What else can we do?  Cheeks?  Well, you might have to do, but now I understand, uh, you probably don't want to, uh, take a  finger and jam it up your ass or anything like that. 
[02:43:30]  I would, I would put it on a paper towel and then have them wipe with it as if they were  wiping their ass.  No, because it might pull something up like that.  Danny just took a dump.  I don't want to see that fucking dirty towel.  Yeah.  You don't have to show us when you're done.  Helmet.  Helmet.  I told you.  Helmet.  Helmet.  I'm not going to put it over the cock hole.  That way.  Way to take a stand, Dan.  Really?  That would, uh, that would do anything degrading. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  That would be so much pain.  Yeah.  That's taking it too far, obviously.  That's your rally cry.  Really?  I would, uh, no.  All right.  What else can we do?  It's got to be between the cheeks.  It's got to be a little bit, not.  The exercising was the thing that was really helping.  We haven't exercised in a while.  And Anthony's coming up with the good exercise.  I'm trying to think of any more.  What was the one exercise that was really good for this?  You know, I don't remember.  The running in place.  Jumping jacks they hated.  They hated jumping jacks.  Okay. 
[02:44:30]  All right, guys.  I had a couple more jumping jacks there.  Everybody's got both hands free now?  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Let's make them count.  All right, make them count.  Let's make them count, guys.  All right, here we go.  More jumping jacks.  Ready?  And go.  Go.  One, two, three, four.  I love the Marine.  Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,  seventeen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, three, four, five. 
[02:45:00]  That's good.  That's good.  That's good.  Anything?  Yeah.  It's starting again.  Eric?  Wait, Eric is staggering.  Eric?  Hey.  Huh?  Some ended up around the crown.  Oh.  You can tell that Nathaniel's martial arts guy, man.  Ah, Danny.  The crown.  All right, more jumping jacks. 
[02:45:30]  This is what's going to do it right here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  More jumping jacks.  Here we go.  Danny's out of shape from smoking, though.  You can't make him do too many jumping jacks.  He'll pass out.  That's all part of the game, Jim.  Good point.  More jumping jacks.  That's what's getting him.  You can't let him recoup here.  Ready?  Let's go.  Another set of fifteen.  Here we go.  It's not that the jumping jacks hurt.  It's this whole process now that hurts.  Yeah, I understand.  But more jumping jacks is going to make it hurt more.  Ready, Nathaniel?  Yes, sir.  All right, here we go. 
[02:46:00]  Dan.  And one, two, three, go.  Exercise.  Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.  That's good.  That's good.  That's good.  That makes their junk kind of move around in areas that it shouldn't be.  Legs together.  Legs together.  Yes, legs together. 
[02:46:30]  Shut up, Kevin.  Shut up.  Oh, wow.  Oh, shit.  He is pissed.  And touch the toes a couple of times.  There you go.  Touch the toes.  There you go.  All right.  Eric?  Oh, oh, Eric.  Oh, oh, oh.  Eric?  It's burning really bad.  Yeah, you better tap out.  Don't do it.  Just tap out.  You got that $100,000, man.  100K.  You got 100K.  Who cares if they ridicule you and call you a faggot?  So what?  Shh. 
[02:47:00]  What do you think, Eric?  I'm still in.  Damn it.  We have a radio show to do.  Yeah.  Jeez.  100,000.  You can stop buying medium T-shirts.  Eric?  What?  You're in?  No, he's fine.  Yeah, I'm still in.  Holy crap.  How are we going to decide?  I don't know now.  Now I'm at a loss.  Why don't we just play rock, paper, scissors?  Yeah, exactly.  Cheeks.  Exactly.  Cheeks.  It's got to be cheeks, man.  Yeah, it would have to be.  It's got to be between cheeks.  I hate the fact that it has to come down to this. 
[02:47:30]  No one wants to.  I hate the fact that it's come down to this.  That it's come down to this, but.  Yes?  Ben?  I think there's a huge sort of gay element to that.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, just the fact.  Are we talking cheeks or.  In between.  I think we're talking like.  Wait, what's the matter?  Danny's saying no.  No.  Danny's saying no.  Because it's going to drip.  Because it kind of like.  It just kind of like melts into you.  So I know it's going to drip and actually get in there.  And that's not going to be fun. 
[02:48:00]  In his ass.  Exactly.  I believe it says for external use only.  Okay.  All right.  That is external.  Someone is suggesting we run out and get some Tiger Bomb.  Ten times hotter than Icy Hot.  Same shit.  I don't know.  These three are troopers and I don't think.  Someone is saying that we should set up a fan to blow air at them.  Well, then they'd have to stand there.  Circle jerk.  Well, Eric.  Bring it on.  I'm ready.  Yeah, he's not giving. 
[02:48:30]  This is amazing.  Really amazing.  Poe suggested those cross-legged jumping jacks.  You know how you cross your legs when you do jumping jacks?  No?  I couldn't even do those.  Like without Icy Hot.  Like this.  Like this.  Yeah.  Like a river dance.  Yeah, exactly.  Do some river dancing.  Something's dripping.  I really think it's between.  It's definitely between Danny and Eric.  I don't know if it's the cream or my actual balls melted.  As far as tapping out.  Nuts have melted.  That's what it feels like. 
[02:49:00]  Eric?  Is it unpleasant?  A little bit.  I'm ready.  Give me something else.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We might be in some trouble here.  One more big dollop.  One more big dollop of Icy Hot.  Here we go.  Yeah, and then we got to figure something out.  We're going to work the exercise angle.  Holy crap.  Huh?  Those squats worked pretty well too, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:49:30]  And I think the bicycle worked pretty good.  Yeah.  Let's apply and...  Yeah, the bicycle.  Yeah.  Squats and bicycle after this.  And apply.  Kev, you got to make sure they're doing it.  Yeah, Kev.  Get down in there.  Danny's not doing it.  I'm trying to get my fucking button.  Good call, Kev.  Yeah.  Good call, Danny.  Kevin, get that buckle for him.  All right. 
[02:50:00]  I'm just looking for anything else that might work.  Yeah.  Get any raid?  Get the razor blades.  Nah.  Jesus, it's fucking everywhere.  No, it's just...  It's not absorbing anymore, Kev.  All right.  It's just getting put...  There's so much of this on your balls  that when you try to apply more,  it just moves it around on your head.  I can't imagine if these guys are dealing with this.  Completely clean hand.  Which is fucking impossible.  Dude, I tried rubbing that all on my balls  and I still have a ton of it. 
[02:50:30]  You just rub it on your underwear.  Ooh.  Uh-oh.  First player on the planet.  Uh-oh.  Controversy.  Is he cheating or he's got the biggest set of balls  on the face of the earth?  Like a basketball.  He's cheating.  He's cheating.  He's cheating.  All right.  Nope.  How come Danny and I have had  totally different looking hands than you?  Uh-oh.  They're accusing him of cheating.  Want to take a look?  Yeah.  As a matter of fact,  Danny definitely would.  Of course he would.  I say a little man-to-man inspecting.  Because I think he's bluffing.  I think there's going to be a big fucking clump  right in his underpants. 
[02:51:00]  Uh-huh.  Well, then take a look.  We could do a post-mortem.  Go get the Tabasco.  Dude.  Oof.  Tabasco.  I don't know what we do here.  All right.  Now we do the squats.  We're squatting and then bicycle kicks.  Put the legs together.  Yes.  May I have something to drink?  No.  No.  All right.  Let's do some squats.  Yeah.  It's got icy hot in it.  Tanded on the water cup that he's been dipping his hand in.  His ball hand.  Go ahead.  And start squatting. 
[02:51:30]  Wow.  Eric is sweating.  All the way down.  One.  There we go.  Two.  Legs together or apart?  Three.  Together.  Together.  That's what I heard.  Yeah.  Everybody legs together.  Three.  Come on.  Three.  Four.  Four.  Ooh.  Eric's having a tough time.  Five.  Five.  Six.  Six.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God. 
[02:52:00]  That might cause spontaneous combustion.  Let's go.  Four more.  Their balls could burst into flames.  Seven.  Seven.  Oh, shit.  Almost fell.  Eight.  Nine.  There you go.  Last one.  Make it deep.  Ten.  There it is.  How are you doing there, Eric?  Eric?  Not good.  Not good?  I've lost all faith. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah?  Wait.  All faith in what?  In the integrity of Eric's play.  Yeah, me too.  You think he's bullshitting?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Anything to win, right there?  Ooh.  Anything to win?  I like this smack talk.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, this will end in a fight.  Yeah.  Good.  Kill two birds with one stone.  We have in front of us the mega death sauce.  What is that now?  The hottest sauce. 
[02:53:00]  That's Blair's death sauce.  Apparently, it's in the Guinness Book World Records as the hottest hot sauce on the planet.  This stuff is like if you get in your face.  Danny again is like saying no.  What?  What?  Dude, I have such a bad tolerance for hot sauce.  My brain would probably explode if I had any of this stuff.  How often have you put it on your balls?  Yeah, exactly.  You're eating it.  Yeah, you're not eating it.  Yeah, it wouldn't be eating it.  It would be putting it on your balls.  Gay men's health crisis.  There goes Steve. 
[02:53:30]  Should we go with the hot sauce?  How would you do that?  Will that be any hotter than the icy hot?  I have no idea.  This is uncharted territory for me.  We didn't think we'd get to this point.  No.  The exercise was working, man.  It's not Eric.  Eric?  No, the exercise was working just because it was exercise.  Let's do more squats.  Let's do more squats if it's hurting.  We need a winner here.  Here we go.  Ten more squats.  And go.  Go.  One. 
[02:54:00]  Two.  Three.  Four.  Five.  Go down.  There you go.  Six.  Seven.  Almost.  Eight.  Nine.  And.  Ten.  Ten.  How are you holding up? 
[02:54:30]  Eric can't stand up straight.  Eric?  My head hurts.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's just the exercise.  Could be.  It's.  Well.  You're fine.  I'm still in it.  Oh.  I thought he was going that time.  I thought they had him.  He's wiping sweat off himself.  Jesus Christ, dude.  Danny's really pissed off. 
[02:55:00]  You don't think he's doing this?  Well, I mean, regardless of whether or not he's doing it, I don't think he's deserving  of a PS, a brand new shiny PSP.  That's not the point, Danny.  What's the point, then, Eric?  Eric, if.  Stay in this.  Eric, if you win the PSP, I want you just to smash it in front of the other guys and  then buy one with your riches.  That's right.  Okay.  Dude, you are worth $100,000.  That's right.  Yeah.  This is just to basically humiliate these two. 
[02:55:30]  He doesn't care about this.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, that's what he's doing.  That's nothing to him.  That's nothing to him.  No, he laughs at that thing.  PSP.  Buys a bunch of them.  Give him to the kids in the neighborhood.  Yeah, there you go.  That's what he does.  He's hurting.  What's hurting?  What's hurting?  It's a combination between the armpit and the sack.  Someone is suggesting we get Steve to give him all wedgies.  Oh, jeez.  That's great.  His underwear is pretty much ruined anyway.  I don't know.  I'm at a loss now. 
[02:56:00]  Would you guys go with the quick wedgie?  Wedgie.  Wedgie.  All right.  All right, get Steve.  Steve's going to love this.  He don't care.  I don't want to touch the...  It's my fantasy come true.  Add heat to it from a hairdryer.  Do we have a hairdryer on hand?  This will kill him.  Yeah.  You have a hairdryer?  I have a hairdryer, but a dryer.  All right, let's get a...  We're going to get a dryer.  It's not one of those things that are used to melt insulators on wire, is it?  It is?  Isn't that a little hot? 
[02:56:30]  No, it's like a hairdryer.  No, it's like one.  It looks like one, but it's about a thousand degrees more.  No, let's see.  All right, we're bringing the hairdryer.  Steve.  Yeah.  Would you give these guys a wedgie?  It has nothing to do with you.  It's all about the lawsuits I don't want to deal with.  Happily.  With your teeth.  All right, you've got to give these guys all a little wedgie.  All right, all right, all right.  The classic wedgie.  We're not talking atomic wedgie.  We're talking a classic back-of-the-underwear lift-up wedgie. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Full forward.  You don't hurt them, but just...  No, I don't want...  Yeah, no hurt.  I think you're already in pain.  Just a snug, you know, not that you're trying to rip it out, not that you're falling and  you're trying to pull your ripcord kind of thing, and it's not working.  Just a firm bit of discipline.  Here's how you do it.  Steve, pull their underwear until you start to get a hard-on.  Oh, oh.  If you're just tuning in, by the way, we should reset this, Anthony.  We've got three guys that are trying to win a PSP. 
[02:57:30]  We've got our boys behind the scenes.  We only have two PSPs.  We started with four guys.  We're down to Eric, Nathaniel, and Danny.  Travis bailed within the first, like, 45 seconds or so.  We're almost, like, 45 minutes into this contest, I think.  I think one of our homeless are missing.  Yeah, the homeless guy just wandered off.  All right.  Go ahead, Steve.  Give them all wedgies.  All right.  Here's the first one.  This is Eric's wedgie.  Two.  One.  Ah!  Ah!  Quickly.  Quickly.  Oh, he went down. 
[02:58:00]  You've got to do it quickly.  You know what?  So it's fair.  You know what?  Steve.  I just wanted Eric to get his wedgie.  Oh!  Danny tapped out!  Danny tapped out!  He just wanted Eric to get a wedgie.  Eric!  Get a mic on Eric!  Eric!  Eric!  How does that feel?  Well, that fucking hurts.  Oh, no.  I've got to say, though, in fairness, I hate to throw Thane under the bus.  He should have to get one, too.  You can't fucking have to get a wedgie.  Yeah, sure.  Thane will take it, but you've got to, just in fairness, for Eric. 
[02:58:30]  Well, keep a mic on Eric.  Eric's losing his mind over there.  Eric?  Steve, you've got to give Thane one.  Eric, are you crying?  Eric, out of fairness.  There are tears coming out of his eyes.  Burning like fuck.  You need to get a wedgie here.  Excuse me.  All right.  And...  Wait.  Keep a mic on Eric.  Where are my undies?  Eric has tears in his eyes.  Go ahead.  So do I.  Three, two, one.  There goes my underpants.  This is the gayest shit we've ever done.  We've got grown men giving other grown men wedgies. 
[02:59:00]  What's wrong with us?  Can I keep it up there or can I pull it down?  Huh?  I've got to keep it up there?  No, you guys are in, man.  I think that they're in.  Yeah, you've proven your mettle.  There you go.  Pull it out of your ass.  Oh, shit.  That's true.  We do have a...  Let's make money bags by a memory card.  I bet.  I can have the one gig.  All right.  Finally.  Yes, then.  You can have the one gig.  All right.  Wow.  Wow.  That was great.  Did you get video of the wedgie?  You got...  All right.  Good.  Travis got video of Eric's wedgie. 
[02:59:30]  That's going to be classic.  God damn.  Huh?  Was my underwear breaking audible?  Yes.  Okay, good.  Your underwear actually busted.  He broke your underwear.  Yeah.  Wow.  Are you wearing...  You're wearing boxers, then?  Yeah, boxers.  And you were wearing...  The boxer briefs.  Boxer briefs.  Yeah, that's a little rougher.  Oh, my God.  That looks so painful.  That wedgie was hysterical.  Danny.  Classic bully wedgie.  Congratulations, Danny, for hanging in there that long.  Yeah.  You did a good job.  Now, go in and wash your balls.  Yeah, I went into the bathroom, and I was just... 
[03:00:00]  You just...  You're looking at the stalls.  You're looking at the sink.  What are you going to do?  You don't even know where to start.  You know what?  I would wet some paper towels, go into a stall, and scrub away.  Just go out of town, right?  Yeah.  Wet a stack, and then wet another stack, put some soap on that one, and then wipe and wash.  I think that's going to activate again.  What the hell are you going to do?  I don't know.  I would dry wipe it.  Dry wipe it, yeah.  That's what I would do.  Ask Travis.  The one that lasted a whole 40 seconds.  Travis, what did you do?  What did you do?  Take a Q-tip and just wipe it off? 
[03:00:30]  Fucking hump.  No, I dry wiped, but that kind of...  Okay.  So I just kind of sat there in pain and sweat, and dry wiped some more, but I wouldn't put water on it.  No?  No.  What about soap and water?  I didn't try soap.  Yeah, like put soap and water on a paper towel,  and scrub vigorously.  All right, go get the razor.  We're going to celebrate by shaving Eric's balls.  You know what, Mike?  Get it off.  Just chew up a little bit of dentine and slap that, or cinnamon gum, and slap that on your sack. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, wow.  You've got to see the video of Eric getting a wedgie.  That is going to be...  There were tears coming out of your eyes, man.  You all right, Eric?  That looked very painful.  Why don't you go wipe off, you fucking cuckoo?  Was it so much the wedgie or the fact that it made it burn and moved it?  The wedgie kind of divided it in half, and then whatever residue was left on the underwear  went all the way down and up.  So it's like a big line going all the way up to the back. 
[03:01:30]  Like you shit yourself off.  Well, fucking, you're tougher than Danny.  That's got to bug Danny.  Danny just didn't want to take the wedgie.  I understand.  He did want to see you get the wedgie, but who wants a wedgie?  No, you've got to keep it fair.  Danny was hurting, too, man.  No one wants a wedgie.  He was hurting bad.  He was hurting really, really bad.  In all fairness.  Here's your PSP.  So Eric Erock gets the PSP and the new infected game, and Nathaniel gets the same.  Doesn't it suck that me and Opie got one of those, and we just had to be us? 
[03:02:00]  You mean you didn't go do this at home just to...  Well, you know, have a little fun.  Yeah, my heart was really going out to you yesterday when you were having all those technical issues with your free PSP yesterday.  Well, we got some audio from the Tonight Show appearance.

Welcome to the Esquire Minute.  I'm Andy Langer.  We like the idea of losing weight.  We just don't want to make a bunch of painful sacrifices to get there.  That's why we asked Lance Armstrong's coach, Chris Carmichael,  to help us generate a list of dietary adjustments that seem minor  until you annualize the results.  Granted, these are laboratory figures in the real world. 
[03:04:00]  You've got to be careful not to offset these changes  by compensating elsewhere in the opposite direction.  But you get the idea.  Minor adjustments can yield major results over time.  For instance, replace your Coke a day with Diet Coke,  and over the course of a year, you could save 51,000 calories,  meaning 14 1⁄2 pounds a year off your bottom line.  Replace those three slices a week of bacon with turkey bacon,  and you're looking at losing another 4 1⁄2 pounds a year.  Who'd have thunk weight loss would be this easy?

Ah, Valentine's Day, the time for love and romance.  As is the case with other holidays, however,  the true history behind Valentine's Day isn't all chocolate and roses. 
[03:05:00]  According to the History Channel, there are at least three different versions  of the legend behind St. Valentine and his day.  The Catholic Church now recognizes three St. Valentines,  each of which was martyred.  The History Channel's website offers explanations for each  and the connections to the heartfelt holiday.  This website also provides a few of recent history's most romantic romances.  There's also a list of intriguing facts and figures about love and marriage.

It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  It helps me not to think of them as human.

[03:07:30]  She's down here, you piece of shit.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I'd kill you, but there's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you. 
[03:08:00]  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell fat girls in a fucking store.  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend.  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you.  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  The Opie and Anthony Show.

Uh, Jackie, what's going on?  I am never, ever, ever having sex again because of your show.  Yeah, what happened to you?  What happened?  Like, this fetish thing?  Yeah.  Ugh.  You don't know what we're going to throw at you.  What about the fetish with the knives?  You like knives?  Get out of here!  That was my best friend.  Anyway.  Hold on, Jackie.  What the hell is this?  Now we've got to explore your little sick world.  Okay, fine. 
[03:12:00]  You're into knives?  Yeah, I'm kind of...  Thanks, bagel knives.  Get out of here!  Bagel knives going up and down her.  What, you like knives being dragged across you or something?  Not, like, blood or anything.  No, but just a thought that something might happen?  No, it just...  It feels good.  I don't know.  It feels good.  I'm going to kill you, Rob.  Rob, get the...  He's being buttered.  Wait, get Rob on the phone.  All right, hold on.  I hate you.  What up? 
[03:12:30]  Hey, Rob.  Yeah.  It's ONA.  Yeah.  She likes knives?  Yeah.  Are you her boyfriend?  No, I'm her roommate.  And what's the deal with her?  She's probably told you.  Actually, I found out by playing around one day.  I pulled out a knife and I just, like, grazed it against her.  She was like...  So, obviously, I kept going with it.  She squirmed all over the place and was leaving slug trails and stuff.  All right, get her back on the phone. 
[03:13:00]  All right.  They want you back.  Nicole had the same fetish.  I swear, Nicole had that same fetish, and I would drag the knives across her neck, and  she loved it.  I'm listening to you all the time.  I love it.  That's better than the Chewbacca defense.  Jackie.  Yeah.  If the knives are sharp, is it really a turn-on?  Yeah.  Have you had sex with a guy just using the knives and stuff?  Yeah.  I've been wanting to come on your guy's show for, like, ever and ever and ever.  And how excited do you get when they're dragging the knives across your body? 
[03:13:30]  Extremely.  Rock.  Why do you get so turned on?  I don't know.  It's just one of those things.  So, if we brought you down in the studio and we dragged knives all over your body, would  you have, like, an orgasm?  It's possible.  I can't promise, but it's definitely possible.  But you would kind of get turned on at the very least.  All right, listen.  All right, book it.  Listen, get your boyfriend to get a knife.  He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, your roommate.  Can I come down and be a guest on a knife dragon? 
[03:14:00]  I like the concept.  All right, Jackie, get naked.  He's got the knife.  He's got the knife?  Oh, my God.  What's...  Wait, wait.  Wait, she's really getting into it.  Jackie.  Get the F out of here.  Get out of here.  You like this?  Yes.  What is he doing?  Say.  What is he doing?  Say.  What is he doing?  He's dragging the knife all over.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:30]  She can't be for real.  Come on.  No, I'm dead serious.  She sounds like she's not faking.  She's still going, and she's like five feet from the phone right now.  Get the phone back on her.  I don't want to hear you.  Yeah.  No offense to you.  You sound like a cool guy.  Get Jackie back on the phone.  Hello?  Jackie.  Get the knife away from me.  They're trying to talk to me.  No, no, no.  Let him do this. 
[03:15:00]  Take one for the...  Fine.  Are you topless or anything?  Yeah.  Holy.  Oh, my God.  She's got to...  We've got to book her.  Where's he putting the knife?  On his stomach.  On your stomach?  Holy.  I'm going to kick you.  I have platform boots on.  No, don't kick him.  The knife might...  Wow, this could be a radio first.  A lot of stabbing.  Are you naked?  No.  All right, get naked.  Take your clothes off. 
[03:15:30]  No.  Come on, please.  At least go topless.  Fine.  All right.  Let him drag the knife across your...  People are in their cars losing it, Jackie.  Just get your shirt off.  Listen up.  It's off?  Yes.  All right.  What kind of boobs you have?  What is he doing?  Is this a scene from 8mm?  She's not faking it. 
[03:16:00]  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Please.  Please.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Jackie, what was he doing with the knife?  He's just dragging it all across my chest and stomach.  Across your boobs and stuff?  Yes.  How sharp is the knife?  It's a bagel knife.  A bagel knife?  What is that?  Like a sharp knife?  It's like a bread knife. 
[03:16:30]  Sharp, very sharp bread knife.  Long and serrated.  Yeah, right.  It's a serrated bread.  I've seen those.  Yeah.  They use them at the bagel store.  Yeah.  And it's very long.  Jackie, that is like the coolest thing I've ever heard, I think.  Does he scrape you a little with the...  He just drags it across, not too sharp, not the cut, but just sharp, like.  Like on the sharp side, he drags it, what, just barely?  Just enough.  Where did this start?  He was just fooling around one day, and he dragged it across my stomach because it was 
[03:17:00]  summer and I had a half shirt on.  And it just, wow.  And you had no idea that this was a turn-on until that happened that day?  Hey, let him drag it, like, just around your very intimate area.  See?  Everyone was pissed off at us 15 minutes ago.  Look, we come back strong for you guys.  Okay, let's listen.  Oh, my God. 
[03:17:30]  Go away.  No.  No, don't send him away.  All right.  All right, we need the grand finale now.  Where's Rob?  Get Rob on the phone.  Okay, hold on.  Yeah.  Rob.  Rob.  Whatever.  You got to listen to me very closely.  All right.  Plunge it into her chest.  No, no, no.  No?  Oh, sorry.  No, no, no, Anthony.  I thought that was where you were going.  I ain't O.J.  No, Rob, listen to me.  And you got to trust me.  You have people freaked out all over the tri-state area right now, okay?  You got to really work it now, all right? 
[03:18:00]  All right?  All right.  She's going to say stop, but you keep going.  All right.  Just don't hurt her.  I have to go on record and say don't hurt her, okay?  No, that's not a problem.  All right.  Get Jackie on the phone.  All right.  All right.  And as soon as we start talking to her, you just go off with the knife, all right?  All right.  Hi, Jackie.  Hi.  Hi. 
[03:18:30]  Hi.  Hi.  I hate you, I hate you. 
[03:19:00]  I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. 
[03:19:30]  I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. 
[03:20:00]  That was good, I was on.  I saw everybody go, oh, oh.  That's, that's something.  Did you hear that?  She wasn't faking that, you could completely tell.  Wow, a knife.  At first I'm like, alright, there's some gag going on here, but that was as real as it gets.  Rubbing a knife. 
[03:20:30]  She was topless, nice body, the guy was rubbing a knife all over her body and it drives her nuts.  Can you believe that fetish?  And she'll be in studio tomorrow.  To-mo-ro.  God, that's kind of a dangerous fetish to have, because if somebody holds you at knife point, you're just, oh!  Doing that sound.  Does she get her sex toys from Ginsu?  The Ginsu.  The Ginsu.  Right.  Damn.  That rocked.  Alright.  Alright. 
[03:21:00]  Cool.  Well, we'll go down here and drag a knife across her.  We gotta get some nice knives.  We have to get, like, really...  Good cutlery set.  Yeah.  Someone go out and get a good cutlery set.  How does she feel about meat cleavers?  Oh.  That could hack right through a bone.  We have to get, like...  You and I have to do another guy.  We have to go three or four guys just working the body with knives.  Dragging knives around her.  Alright?  Yeah.  Anthony, let's regroup.  Imagine a machete or a sword from, like, the Renaissance fair.  She'd be off. 
[03:21:30]  Impale her.  Nice.  Hey, this is Bob Saget.  Yeah, it rhymes with faggot.  I had a fucked up childhood.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Should we get Knife Girl in here, Ant, to say hi and stuff?  Yeah, let's have her say hi and see what the deal is with her.  We just talked to her on the phone yesterday.  Big Kev.  Yeah.  Yeah, you do have a stripper body.  Look at you.  Get over here.  Wow, look at that.  There we go.  Knife Girl.  Jackie the Knife Girl.  Hello.  How you doing?  Good.  You're the girl that was getting turned on by that knife yesterday, huh? 
[03:22:00]  Wow, look at you.  Your clothes are barely on you.  Yeah.  She's got a little tat going on.  What's that all about?  It's the Egyptian Eye of Horus.  Yes.  Wait, get her.  I noticed that it was Egyptian.  Get her some.  I've seen it in movies.  Some headphones.  So everyone's talking about you today, Jackie.  Yeah.  I don't understand why.  Why?  What do you mean?  I don't get it.  I don't understand why it's so exciting.  You turned people on so much yesterday.  I don't think anyone has turned on people like you did yesterday.  And we've had some freaky stuff on this show. 
[03:22:30]  Very flattered.  Are you?  Yes.  How old are you again?  22.  22.  22.  Very tall, Anthony.  How tall are you?  I'm 5'7", but I have these on.  Wow.  Well, look at those.  Those are those big.  The Gene Simmons shoes, man.  I was actually kind of afraid that I wouldn't be able to get in.  I thought there was going to be like a metal detector at the front door.  What are you kidding?  Did you bring your knife?  This place?  Yes.  You told me to bring a knife.  Hey, Kev, give me those knives.  Oh, yeah?  You got a knife?  No, don't let her say it.  Let's see your knife.  Let's see your knife.  I'm kidding. 
[03:23:00]  Ow.  I don't like the knives.  Whoa.  Wow.  Let me see.  Bagel knife.  That's a bagel knife.  That's a bagel knife.  Holy smoke, is that sharp?  That was the knife the guy was using yesterday.  And does he drag it on you like this?  Like the way it would cut on the blade?  How does that not cut you?  The weight of the knife alone would.  And just talking about it, she's getting all turned on.  Look at you.  Yeah?  Look at her.  She's squirming, Anthony.  Does he go like this?  Like gently?  Look at her. 
[03:23:30]  She's getting turned on when just you're doing that.  Yes.  Oh, yay.  All right, look.  I'm just doing it on a piece of paper on the console.  We've got a couple more tricks for you today.  Okay.  What do you think of this?  Now, you're going to have to trust us because we sound like psychopaths on the radio,  but we're really just psychopaths.  I brought Rob with me.  All right, ready?  Wow.  It's a very large knife.  Is that a good one?  That's the classic Rambo knife.  Yeah.  Dylan!  No, the Rambo knife. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, and why don't you try it out on the piece of paper and see.  Let's see.  Look at her.  Wow.  That's weighted knife.  How sharp is that, though?  It's sharp.  It's pretty sharp.  It's very sharp.  Okay.  All right.  Is it like a gently dragging thing over you so as not to cut?  Wow, look at her.  Yeah.  You're going to be all right?  Yeah, I'll be fine.  Could you imagine this just on your skin?  Look how sharp that blade is.  Wow, she's blushing and everything.  Are you having fun so far?  Absolutely.  All right.  I love the show. 
[03:24:30]  You love the show?  Absolutely.  And work that knife again on the paper.  Oh, yeah, like this.  Look at her.  Her little bagel knife, and what they do is just slowly drag it across your belly and your  breasts and stuff, yeah, like that.  Wow.  Why can't you look at it?  She really likes that thing.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  What's going on just seeing that?  It's just funny.  I just think it's funny that people just really like my fetish.  All right.  Yeah. 
[03:25:00]  I'm going to show you something else.  Okay.  All right.  Pull those out.  See what she thinks of this.  It's a Freddy glove.  It's a Freddy glove.  What do you think of this?  They're real knife blades.  They're really?  Wow.  You're closer to her.  Check this out.  Check out the Freddy Krueger glove.  What do you think?  We made this for Halloween.  Yeah.  Isn't that pretty cool?  It's neat.  I like it.  Yeah.  Can we use it on your body or what?  If you feel the need.  Really?  Feel the need.  She's looking at us like we're loonies.  Like we're loonies.  That's great.  And work it on the paper.  See if there's any reaction going on. 
[03:25:30]  Would you like this?  Like that?  It's weird looking.  It's not very sharp either.  You need sharp?  Yeah.  She needs sharp.  Like sharp is really hot for you?  Oh my God.  The sharper the better, right?  Absolutely.  So that Rambo knife is going to drive you nuts.  Probably.  Yeah.  That's pretty sharp.  Wow.  This is wild.  All right.  Can we start with the Freddy Krueger glove as a warm up maybe?  Sure.  And then we'll do your bagel knife that's real sharp.  She likes the bagel knife.  And then we'll go to the Rambo knife?  Right.  We got to make sure we're careful with the Rambo knife here. 
[03:26:00]  Oh yeah.  Rob's outside.  Oh yeah.  My roommate.  That's the guy that was doing it.  Yeah.  All right.  Get Rob in here for a minute.  Hey Rob.  What's up?  Hey.  So you guys aren't banging at all?  No.  I thought for sure you guys would do it after yesterday's little phone call.  No.  That incident has happened before.  Yeah.  Like I told you the first time.  It was like a total accident.  I was just like being goofy and ran it across her and went wild. 
[03:26:30]  So obviously I kept milking it out of her.  Yeah.  Everyone is talking about you guys today.  Everybody.  We've done a lot of crazy stuff on this show.  But I mean the reaction that we got after you guys called in yesterday.  Unbelievable.  Never seen anything like it.  Did you see the knives we have for her today?  Oh no I have.  I saw the Freddy glove though.  And the Rambo knife.  Show them the Rambo knife.  Yeah.  This one's pretty good.  Oh yeah.  That's nice.  You think she's going to like that one?  Yeah.  Probably.  Unless she might just be into household cutlery. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  You know?  Like I thought the whole thing would get a wow out of you guys.  But I didn't think you guys would be this crazy.  Oh we'd want to see it.  Just from her reaction.  The noises she really was making sounds.  Yeah.  The noises she was making yesterday were just unbelievable.  Because like she had no idea.  I had it all in my head.  As soon as she called I was like I'm going to blow this up for it.  Yeah.  I just wanted to talk.  Right.  I figured you guys would dig it.  So.  Well can we get you like naked and do this next or what?  Sure. 
[03:27:30]  Sure.  Sure.  Why not?  Alright.  I'm here.  Alright.  Jackie the knife girl in studio.  And uh.  Oh look who's back.  Steve that's uh Jackie the knife girl.  Hi Jackie.  What's up?  Anthony what's up?  How's it going guys?  Alright.  Love your show.  Now listen I think this woman would absolutely lose it if you blindfold her.  Does that work?  It really doesn't make a difference to me.  No.  No I don't think it makes a difference.  I don't think so either.  She was getting turned on just looking at the knives.  That is.  Really?  Yeah.  Look at her.

[03:29:30]  fine young ladies in the studio right now?  Yeah I know.  I love you.  Well it turns out knife girl.  Well I love you.  Yeah knife girl loves you Kevin.  Really?  Yes.  I'm a big fan.  Awesome.  She loves being rubbed with knives.  Isn't that freaky man?  She gets really turned on Kevin.  Is it all form of cutlery or just knives?  It's usually just knives.  Really?  The sharper the better.  How about a spatula?  A spatula.  I don't know.  Kevin you gotta see her face when you rub the knives all over her body she just uses 
[03:30:00]  it.  Really?  She starts blushing.  She starts moaning and she gets scared at the same time.  Jackie do you have a boyfriend?  No.  Oh.  Kevin you think you could fit Jackie the knife girl in your next film or what?  I don't know.  I mean what else can she do besides that?  How many people ask him that every day?  Actually that's how Affleck got into the movies.  He was way into having knives run across his body.  Really?  Yeah.  I heard that.  Hey you got a question for Kevin Smith knife girl?  I wouldn't know what to ask him. 
[03:30:30]  I'm just so amazed by his work.  Really?  Just don't ask how much I weigh.  That's the only question I don't really want to answer.  No.  I'm just amazed with your work.  I live in Jersey.  I know all the places.  What part of Jersey are you from?  I live in Seaside but I used to live in Middletown right next to Red Bank.  Get out of here.  Yeah.  I know Middletown very well.  Yeah.  I know Seaside as well.  Yeah.  I live in Seaside.  God I wish you wouldn't have let that information slip because it just keeps the myth up that  all the Jersey people are whacked out.  So far that's all we're saying.  Did you hear the knife girl?  She's from Jersey of course.  We talked about that the other day. 
[03:31:00]  Everybody that comes in here seems to be from Jersey to do all kinds of effed up stuff.  Kevin we had to take the knives away from the tinkler because we don't trust her.  We got a Rambo knife in here too today.  Really?  Yeah.  And we got a really sharp bagel knife.  Yeah.  You must get some wild girls.  Nothing like that my friend.  Really?  Actually I don't get wild girls at all.  No.  I mean I got married and she was wild enough.  Oh yes.  Still magic.  Yeah.  Still pretty good.  We were just talking about it last night.  We were laying around and I was a friend of mine was debating getting engaged and he said 
[03:31:30]  I don't know it means I can't have sex with anyone else for the rest of my life.  I said well number one no it doesn't but number two number two I mean if that's your  feeling don't get engaged.  I mean get engaged with a person that you can't wait to have sex with for the rest of your  life.  Right on.  There you go.  Yeah.  So I watched Dogma again last night.  That's an awesome movie.  Isn't that the that is such a great movie.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You know with all the stars in Dogma Jay just just just he stole the movie and it was  after that.  He stole the movie.  He so did and they all acknowledge it too.  Nobody was really nobody's nobody's ego was bruised by that. 
[03:32:00]  Chris Rock Ben Matt Linda they all acknowledge it right away.  You know after the first week of rehearsals they're like my god it's his movie isn't it.  I just love how you guys just turn up in every movie.  Yeah.  And you don't even change your persona.  No.  Just throw Jay and Silent Bob in.  It comes down to the fact that I'm just not that talented.  So I just keep working on what works you know if it's not broke don't fix it.  Yeah.  What's with the alternate ending for Clerks? 
[03:32:30]  It was the original ending the one that we shot and after people started seeing the  movie they were like why why do you kill the guy at the end.  And I was like I just I really didn't know how to end the movie.  It just seemed like the note to go out on.  Yeah that was really cool that you killed him I thought.  He's not even supposed to be there that day and he gets killed.  But people convinced me to cut it which I'm cool with.  I was totally cool that it was one of those cuts that I was like no it's what the movie's  about.  Just didn't know how to end it.  I was a really big Do the Right Thing fan. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  And Do the Right Thing is a movie that I love and it's so funny.  It's an incredible movie that you know really becomes quite powerful.  You know at a certain point in the movie toward the end Mookie throws a garbage can through  the window.  Suddenly all the race issues that have been bubbling throughout the movie that are handled well  and handled humorously become quite deadly serious.  Yeah.  So Clerks to me was kind of like Do the Right Thing in as much as the structure is kind of  similar.  Like you know it takes place all in the span of a day in a certain block you know in a  neighborhood.  But you know Spike has everything to say and he's very socially aware and me I had nothing 
[03:33:30]  to say.  I just wanted to tell some fart jokes.  Are you just amazed with that you know?  Yeah.  You put together a movie for a lot.  How much did Clerks cost you?  28 grand.  And what did you just like bring up some credit cards and make a movie?  It was pretty much all credit cards.  Finance the picture that way.  And now huge companies hand you lots of money to make movies.  They do.  Now they give me healthy budgets.  What a goof.  I'm not one of those cats that really goes nuts and wants a lot of money. 
[03:34:00]  I try to keep the budgets low because I like what I do but I'm not the most ardent believer  in the fact that there's a huge audience for what we do out there.  Eventually they find the flicks if they don't see them in theaters they see them on video.  Yeah.  But I just don't.  I'm not one of those guys that gives like give me 50 million bucks because I can't  guarantee 50 million dollars worth of business is going to come our way.  Well it doesn't seem to stop other people.  No.  They'll pump out some real crap.  Too true.  Hey Kevin, you met our buddy Jay Moore recently.  I love Jay Moore. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  In fact I was going to bring him up before because when I saw him out here I saw him  not this time that I came out but about a month ago I had to come out for some casting  and we sat around talking about you guys and your show for about 20 minutes.  He was the guy that really hit me to it.  He's like you've got to go on Opie and Anthony those guys are awesome.  He had nothing but wonderful things to say about you guys.  Screw the phone stuff.  You've got to come in here live, man.  I know.  I told Big Kev that when I come back in the spring we're done with the movie out here I'll definitely  come in.  It's a party every day.  You just let us know when you're coming in.  We'll get some freaky stuff going on for you. 
[03:35:00]  He explained the whole wow thing to me because I'd seen the wow bumper stickers all over the  turnpike and whatnot.  Yeah.  And he explained it to me.  I was like wait no women take their blouses off?  That's right.  We're amazed.  I want in.  We're amazed.  We came up with the wow idea and the girls decided to do it.  Good for you.  We didn't think it was going to work.  Right.  We never think any of this was going to work.  Good for you guys.  Hey are you reviving Fletch?  Fletch?  Without Chevy Chase.  I don't know.  I don't know if Chevy's going to come back or not.  At one point.  Kevin. 
[03:35:30]  Without Chevy Chase.  Well like I said.  I you know.  I mean.  I'm leaving the door open but the fact of the matter is the script is based on a book  called Fletch One which is about the fifth or sixth book in a series of books that Gregory  McDonald wrote because that's where the Fletch movie came from from the series of books and  that book is about a kind of origin story of Fletch like it goes back and tells his first  story of how he went from writing the obituaries of the paper to becoming an investigative journalist.  So it calls for a younger Fletch anyway so Chevy can't really play that character because 
[03:36:00]  it's a it's a year one type story.  He really was great in the first one.  He was wonderful in the first one.  Just give him a cameo or something.  That's what we're trying to think like if we had a framing device where it's kind of  the old Fletch is telling the tale of his first adventure or whatever you call it.  Yes.  Then you then you could kind of throw the bone to the to the hardcore Fletch fans by  having him there.  Yeah.  Something happened with Chevy.  He's just well I'll be honest he's just not doing it for me anymore.  Well what you you weren't a huge fan of Snow Day.  Come on. 
[03:36:30]  How many days was that in the theater?  You know that that cracked up some business man.  I made like 60 70 million dollars.  No the funniest one was that a toxic waste one that he was in.  Which one was that?  Remember Chevy and he got some toxic waste.  Oh oh modern problems.  Modern problems.  Which according to like people in this industry was a brilliant script that went wrong.  Come on.  I swear it's one of it's one of those things you always hear about people say like one  of the best unproduced screenplays was modern problems until they produced it.  Apparently the script was supposed to be very good and the movie just kind of went way 
[03:37:00]  south.  You got to put Jay Moore in Fletch.  Yeah.  Well there's there's actually a part Mosier my producer Scott Mosier was was at the meeting  with Jay too and and there wasn't really anything in the movie we're doing.  Now for him but he right away was just like oh there's definitely something for him and  Fletch and I was like oh god yeah I've met the cat once before and very funny guy.  Yeah.  Sharp as a tack.  He does great stuff for our show so.  Yeah that's what he said that he goes on the show and like whenever he goes to do like  stand-up appearances and whatnot half the audience or more is filled with ONA fans. 
[03:37:30]  It's insane.  Yeah he said that I'd given him props on something he had said to me like he had used a line that  I really thought was brilliant where he's describing somebody's reaction to something  and he said it was like a retarded kid looking at a ferris wheel.  And I said it's such a great line and I've always wanted to co-opt it but I couldn't because  it's so good and I don't want people to think that I came up with it so I never used it.  And he said I just used it again recently last time I was on Opie and Anthony and I said  look at Opie he's looking at the chick with her with her blouse off like a retarded kid  looking at the ferris wheel. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah that was it.  And he said they like that too.  I said that's such a great line.  He's a very funny guy.  He does the premier Christopher Walken impression too.  It's amazing.  He really does.  He's a pretty genius mimic.  You must smoke a lot of weed as they say.  You know I'm not.  What is this weed you speak of I'm not familiar with.  Yeah.  We get that all the time too though.  You must smoke a lot of weed.  Yeah thanks for turning everyone on to the stink pom.  I really appreciate it.  I mean you think you've got it bad.  Like I do college gigs and whatnot and when I do appearances or signing things or go to 
[03:38:30]  a comic book convention.  Every guy I meet who shakes my hand has a glint in his eye and a smirk on his face.  I carry around that stuff that you rub in your hands is supposed to kill 99.9% of the germs.  Yeah.  All the time because people are just like I stink bombed you man.  I'm like thanks that's my fire.  That's my legacy.  You're still getting .1% ass.  Exactly.  No matter how much you scrub.  Exactly.  No matter what I do I always carry a little piece of them with me.  Home to the wife.  I was at an hour game I shook someone's hand and then I got an email like that the following 
[03:39:00]  Monday morning.  Hey Ope I met you at the Islander game and I gave you a stink pom.  I'm like ugh.  Classy.  Isn't it classy?  It's good when you have props and peeps out there.  Nice.  Yeah.  That are willing to go the extra nine.  The full distance for you.  There you go.  Absolutely.  Well Kevin we've got to get you in the studio.  Well definitely coming in the spring.  That's great.  Cool man.  All right we're going to let you go because Jackie the knife girl is getting a little  Yeah please go back to that.  That is far more important.  No.  I think he is more important.  No not at all.  Madam what you do is very exquisite talent. 
[03:39:30]  Thank you.  Do you have anything else for Kevin Smith before we let him go?  I have nothing I could possibly think of that would interest him.  No.  Really?  Everyone has.  You don't know.  I'm a very boring cat so a lot of stuff interests me.  No?  All right.  No not really.  Is she pretty?  Yes.  You guys are so lucky.  I want my own radio show.  It's fun.  She's a stripper and she likes that nice.  You should go to BotCon in North Carolina this year.  We're going.  BotCon?  Yeah.  What's that?  What is it?  It's a Transformers convention. 
[03:40:00]  Transformers convention?  Absolutely.  As in Robots in Disguise?  Yes.  Really?  More Than Meets the Eye?  I love his fault.  He turned me on to Transformers.  Remember that?  Transformers.  Yeah.  Robots in Disguise.  More Than Meets the Eye.  They just released the Transformers movie on DVD.  Absolutely.  Really?  And it's called BotCon?  BotCon.  BotCon.  The other one's in the section behind the curtain.  Well, I have no interest in BotCon.  BotCon, I was there for her.  All right.  Well, Kevin, I'm going to let you go.  Thank you so much for calling us. 
[03:40:30]  No, thanks for having me on.  We're all big fans.  Our producer wants to just talk to you for one second, all right?  Okay.  All right, there he goes.  Kevin Smith, everyone.  Very cool.  Wow.  Boy, that increases the hypness factor of this show.  What happened?  We're starting to get people on our show.  I like it.  All right, Knife Girl is ready to go, Anthony.  Yep.  We've got to interrupt the festivities because you can't have someone like Kevin Smith on hold, right?  No.  Absolutely not.  Out of her mind.  We have to take a break.  We'll get back to Jackie the Knife Girl with the knives next, okay? 
[03:41:00]  Right.  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of radio over the years.  This is probably the worst.  Way back in the middle 60s, there was a small station outside of Moline, Illinois.  I believe it was WRCW.  I'm not sure of the call letters.  It was 1590 day timer.  I'll sign off at Sunrise, Sunset, rather.  They were pretty darn bad.  But this is probably worse.  Agapame to Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.

[03:42:00]  This is Jim Blassingame, the Small Business Advocate with a Small Business Minute.  One of the most important concepts for any small business owner to embrace is leverage.  Right now, let's talk about leveraging other people's time, energy, and brain power.  You must be able to share the vision for your business with managers.  Because they must be able to help you establish goals that will take your company to the winner's circle.  Then, all of you must be able to manage the business in a way that accomplishes those goals. 
[03:42:30]  If your vision and the goals are to stay on track, have regular sessions where the company leadership revisits your plan and compares it to actual performance.  With this measurement, you can run a finely tuned organization.  Without it, you've got something that looks more like a goat roping or a cat roundup.  Write this on a rock.  You must share your vision with your managers and staff.  This is Jim Blassingame, the Small Business Advocate.  I'll see you on the radio or on the internet at smallbusinessadvocate.com.

[03:43:30]  Welcome to the Esquire Minute.  I'm Andy Langer.  In every issue, we get free advice from a medical professional, Dr. Oz.  Let's say your doctor seems more interested in his quality of life than yours.  Dr. Oz's tip on being smart about finding a new one, ask around, he says.  Specifically, ask a nurse.  No one knows more about doctors than nurses.  Once you've found someone you're comfortable with, you need to convey your health profile in writing.  With as much detail as possible. 
[03:44:00]  Then you can start learning.  The word doctor comes from the Latin for teacher.  So assume the role of a student.  Always bring a notepad to appointments and write down your questions ahead of time.  You're bound to forget at least some of what he tells you.  So it's a good idea to bring a tape recorder as well.  You're paying good money for the appointment.  You might as well get everything you can out of it.  For more, check out this month's issue of Esquire on News Stance Now.  Or visit us on the web at Esquire.com.  We'll see you next time. 
[03:44:30]  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time. 
[03:45:00]  And my hot, wax Shannon is here.  She's got a little present for us.  She's going to bring it in a little while.  But why don't we get to Jackie, the knife girl, Anthony?  Yes.  You want to, like, set this up really fast?  I think everyone knows what we're talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead.  We called up yesterday.  We found out she has a knife fetish on the phone.  And our roommate over here was dragging knives across her.  And she was squealing with delight in such a way that I think every radio is tuned in.  And the guys are having problems driving. 
[03:45:30]  I'm sorry.  The guys really like that.  No, no, never be sorry about that.  I don't want to crash cars.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  That is always the goal.  It worked.  Of this show, to get people to crash.  Car accidents.  She was cordially invited to come in today and have various knives dragged across her  to see what this is like live.  Yes.  You know?  All right, why don't we get into this, Anthony?  Yes, why don't we?  All right.  We've got to move the mics around and stuff.  All right, we've got a mic.  We've got the lesbian couch.  I hope you don't mind.  It's okay.  We can lay down plastic if you like. 
[03:46:00]  I mean, it's a little gnarly, the couch these days.  I really don't care.  You don't care.  Okay.  Now, who do you want to do the knife thing?  You want Rob to?  I trust him.  You trust Rob?  I'm afraid everybody else is going to stab me.  Oh, Jackie, get on the couch.  It's really cold in here.  This glove is like tetanus ridden.  All right, Rob's got the.  Wow.  Rob's got the Rambo knife that Scott brought in earlier.  And you got the other knife, too?  The bagel knife?  Give me that mic.  I've got to move on.  Don't confuse bagel knife with little butter knife. 
[03:46:30]  Bagel knife is big, long, serrated knife you use to cut the bagels in the bagel stores.  You ever see those guys?  Hey, my mic just stopped.  That's great.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm just talking to myself.  No problem.  Mic just shuts off.  All right, I need a mic so I can get over there.  We're moving some mics around so we can play along.  Jackie, you can get more comfortable if you like.  Whatever you want to do.  I don't want to force you into doing anything you don't want to do.  Looks like you have some nice panties under those leather pants. 
[03:47:00]  All right.  She's got to take her shoes off to take her pants off.  Well, of course.  Oh, wait.  That works?  Focus.  Yeah, it's better that we have our knife.  All right.  I hope you can plug in over there.  No, this is good.  I got a good view.  Anthony?  Very good.  Jackie's getting naked, Anthony.  Let me move over to the other mic, Opie.  Is that mic working right here?  All right, cool.  God, other shows just set up all this stuff on the commercials play, but we don't care.  It's Jackie the knife girl.  She gets turned on by having knives rubbed all over her body. 
[03:47:30]  Wonderful.  Her roommate, who she's not having sex with, Rob, is going to do the deed.  That's a matter of fact.  Hi, Rachel.  Ah.  So there's a guy named Rachel involved here.  That's what I'm figuring out.  It's his fiance.  I'm teasing, of course.  All right, so Rob wants to make it perfectly clear that he is not having sex with Jackie the knife girl.  You know, this moment looks very dangerous.  Look at this.  This looks like the beginning of a snuff film.  Yeah.  It really does. 
[03:48:00]  Rob, can we trust you?  Because that's a Rambo knife.  We're not playing with bagel knives anymore.  Actually, the bagel knife is far better than the Rambo knife anyway.  All right, Rob, you know what?  For the photo op, I think it would be best if you were behind the couch.  Ooh.  We had a lot of requests to be completely silent for this bit.  Okay.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
[03:48:30]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh 
[03:49:00]  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh 
[03:49:30]  Oh 
[03:50:00]  He's picking up the Rambo knife  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh 
[03:50:30]  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh 
[03:51:00]  Oh  Oh  Holy S  He just picked up the pretty girl of love  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh 
[03:51:30]  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  He's cutting her breath off. 
[03:52:00]  This is when he gets right by the vag.  She's got like knife marks all over her belly.  Her belly is like pink. 
[03:52:30]  You hear the play.  You're listening to the sounds of a knifing. 
[03:53:00]  They don't usually bring you the sounds of a girl being stroked with a knife.  Watch that nip.  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  He's working.  Oh my god. 
[03:53:30]  He just plunged the knife into the couch.  That was scary.  That was scary. 
[03:54:00]  She's got the knife down her panties.  You could fillet her up real nice.  A little tenderizing down you go. 
[03:54:30]  I'm going to stand here and watch him cut that thing open and have that little kitten her boy spill out all over the floor.  Sorry.  This isn't a place for comedy.  Shut up.  Round zero.  This is a turn on. 
[03:55:00]  Go for her throat.  Oh, you wrecked it.  Hey, I ruined it.  You ruined it.  I ruined it.  What a way to end though.  Bravo!  Bravo!  Wow.  Nice.  Let me be the first to say the most erotic thing I've ever seen in my life right there. 
[03:55:30]  Wow.  That was something.  My god.  You've got to be kidding me.  Rob.  Rob and Jackie.  Holy ass.  But you didn't have to have OJ come in.  I can't possibly compare to OJ.  No, no, no.  My knife session didn't last that long.  Wait in.  I was in and out.  You've got to come back here for a second.  Yeah.  Look at her body.  I saw.  I was right there.  There are knife scratches all over her body.  She's all pink. 
[03:56:00]  No, it's not just...  No, it's not like she's pink.  It's like a cat.  You know when you get clawed by a cat?  It's all over her belly, all over her legs.  That's what I was saying when I saw her laying there.  They're like just fine scratches all over her body.  Nice.  Bravo.  How was that, Jackie?  It was very nice.  Very nice.  Very nice?  I don't know what else to say.  That was just amazing.  Man.  Anthony.  What are you thinking?  That was nice, but where's the guy that brings her sunglasses? 
[03:56:30]  Wow.  Hey.  I ruined it.  Well, you can put your clothes on.  Anthony.  What?  Anthony, you dick.  You dick.  You dick.  Hey, I ruined it.  I was ready to say you're the best, Anthony.  I love you, but you dick.  What'd you do?  It was a perfect end.  This is the end.  What are you talking about?  Of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, okay.
