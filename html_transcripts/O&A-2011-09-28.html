<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an introduction by Larry King, immediately transitioning into a tirade about the substandard conditions of their SiriusXM studio.  Opie and Anthony vehemently complained about the inadequate lighting, specifically citing the unusable, intensely bright yellow gels provided by the station despite their requests for proper lighting for video production.  This fueled a broader discussion encompassing their frustrations with malfunctioning equipment, feeling rushed during a scheduled interview with Michael K. Williams due to scheduling conflicts, and the constant interruptions from publicists.  A caller, Tony, criticized their complaints, sparking a heated argument laced with profanity, with the hosts defending their position based on their contributions to the station and the showâ€™s success.  The discussion included their strained relationship with management, outlining strategies to avoid certain executives and recounting past confrontations.  Sam, a member of the production team, became involved in the conversation, particularly regarding his role in obtaining the problematic yellow gels. The segment also briefly touched on a recent incident involving a hockey player using a homophobic slur, incorporating sound effects and snippets from *Caddyshack* throughout.

The show then shifted its focus to NHL player Sean Avery and a video showing him seemingly mouthing a homophobic slur during a game, although the audio was unclear.  Opie and Anthony, along with callers like Kirby from Canada, debated the validity of the lip reading, the NHL's lack of disciplinary action, and the prevalence of such language in a violent sport. This discussion included graphic descriptions of bodily sensations and vulgar speculation about what Avery might have said. The conversation then moved to movie reviews of "Contagion" and "Unthinkable," with the hosts sharing their reactions and discussing plot points.  Finally, a caller named Bobo reported the circulation of fake photos of him with Howard Stern on Twitter. The hosts attempted to find these pictures, ultimately concluding they were indeed fake.  Throughout this segment, the broadcast featured extensive use of offensive language, particularly homophobic slurs and descriptions of bodily functions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, it's Larry King. What the hell am I doing here?  Wait a minute, you want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You gotta go.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, fuck yeah! This place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on this.  Yeah, I think a lot.  It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews and of course your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it. 
[00:00:30]  This show is so disorganized.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying it.  Well then, turn off God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts and we already know this is gonna be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you gonna be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton? 
[00:01:00]  Hello, hello, hello, hello.  Mic check, mic check.  Checking.  Checking.  I'm sure everything is properly working.  I got my mic on.  Well, not everything.  How many issues do we have this morning?  See, I love this.  See, well, you know, there's a conflict among the listeners. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  There's a handful of babies that hate when we bitch.  And there's a lot of people that understand because this is real life shit.  They go through some of this shit at where they work.  So they kind of like it.  Today we got one, two, three, at least three issues since we left yesterday. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And the difference is, you know, I don't get angry anymore because I have completely given up.  I mean.  Why bother?  I have passion for radio.  Absolutely.  I have passion for doing radio with these guys, but I don't have passion for this company anymore because I can't.  I just can't do it anymore.  And the beauty is it's a wonderful big world out there.  And I have no doubt that after this, this ends here, I and we will be just fine. 
[00:02:30]  Usher in a brand new era.  Right.  Because, you know, the reason why I yelled and screamed and sounded like a lunatic all these years, I really gave a shit about the company and just wanted to, you know, for everyone to succeed.  Well, that's silly.  And we just, we just can't get it done.  No.  The simplest, dumbest things.  We saw the video of Howard's brand new studio the other day and he's got the right people behind him.  Yeah.  I mean, that pan shot, that fucking studio looks beautiful.  Yeah.  It's like goes from a crane shot. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  It goes down.  It's dollying at the same time.  It's coming down.  It's like a cinematic magic.  Gorgeous.  And I know we're, we're, we're different people.  We're different shows.  And, you know, there's, there's different money involved.  I get all that.  But there is such a drop off between his studio and our studio.  And we just can't get basic shit accomplished for this studio.  What are you going to do?  You know, we, we were never supposed to be in this closet.  You've heard it a million times.  We were never supposed to be in this closet. 
[00:03:30]  This was supposed to be temporary.  But now we're over two years in, two and a half years.  Temporary is such a vague thing.  So then we're like, okay, at least fix the lights for us.  Because when we shoot video and, and, and take pictures, because that social networking thing,  I don't know how to tell these guys down the hall, but it's really important.  Yeah.  And it's a visual, you know, medium.  Yeah.  And our pictures and videos look, you know, average at best.  So we figure if we get some nice lights in here, at least it'll look a little better.  Punch them up a little bit. 
[00:04:00]  And then people could like maybe respect us just slightly more.  And maybe it'll, maybe it'll lead to some bigger things for the show, you know, maybe  even bigger guests and bigger things we could do.  So, uh, you don't think this looks like that at all?  Well, we're looking at a video of the, uh, Howard's studio.  That's how news, that's how news shows open.  Oh yeah.  I'm not, you know, and I'm not saying, you know, we're Howard.  I'm not, I'm not going to do that.  You know, he's, he's had a massive fucking career, but we've done okay in our own right. 
[00:04:30]  But I'm just talking about the drop off between this beautiful fucking studio that, that debuted  this week.  Yeah.  Even though he's suing the company, which just makes me laugh my balls off.  That's just funny to me.  You want to see, uh, the latest addition to our studio?  Oh yeah.  I've yet to really see these in action, but I begged the guys to not show you until we're 
[00:05:00]  live, just so I could get your reaction.  I've only heard.  Well, as, as you know, we've, we've been asking.  Close the curtain, Sam.  I want to get the full effect of what's going on in here today.  We've been asking about, uh, the lighting in here for the video.  Yes.  And, uh, I have also suggested on, on the air that maybe we get some gels over the front  of these lights, because as you know, we've turned them on and they've been like the  sun.  Right.  It's just been the brightest fucking lights.  Well, yeah.  Well, just to go back a little bit, we wanted new lights.  So they, I don't know where they got these two lights from. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  We're suspicious.  We think that it's just leftover shit from Howard's place.  Yeah.  But it might not be.  I don't know.  Uh, they're, they're placed in the wrong position in the studio to begin with.  And they're too bright.  Like you said, you literally go blind when we turn them on.  Right.  Yeah.  You start seeing spots, right?  Yeah.  It's, it's such a stark white light.  Yeah.  So we, uh, especially Anthony said, look, you know, the solution is, is pretty easy.  Just get some gels for this.  And then we could, we could, we could work with it.  Yeah.  We're always telling this company we can work with what you give us. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  Yeah.  You get some gels, you put it on.  Yeah.  And, uh, that should solve the problem of it being such a stark white light.  Right.  And the video looking, uh, silly.  You could always solve it with a little nice lighting.  Oh, why are you opening the door?  You're going to, you're going to mess up.  Look, everyone's coming in for the big reveal.  They're so excited.  Uh, so this, um, they got yellow gels.  Right.  Uh, which I've yet to see these things turned on.  We, what, what, what I, what I suggested was something, a little peach, perhaps. 
[00:06:30]  Soft.  I remember you saying soft.  You could barely, the gel almost looks clear when, when it's not in front of the light.  Or even a blue or, or, or something to, to calm down the white light.  It brings out the reds better.  It's just not what they got.  And this is a heavy, heavy yellow color gel.  It's a, it's the same color as our logo.  One, two, three, four, five.  And then there's another 12 lights in here.  Little ones that had these gels in it. 
[00:07:00]  And unfortunately, Mara said, I, I, I can't, I can't do that to you guys.  Because it would take probably an hour to get the studio back to a, to a place where  we could broadcast.  So you're ready for the big reveal on the, the, the old lights with the new yellow gels.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's.  And I'm just going to sit back and I'm going to allow you guys to react and let, let the  sounds tell the story.  Yes.  Let's, let's flip them on.  Go ahead, guys.  Three, two, one.  Jimmy's just shaking his head.  Jimmy's just shaking his head. 
[00:07:30]  I feel like a French fry.  It's like under a heat lamp at McDonald's three, two, one.  Okay.  It is yelling or screaming.  Cause I don't, whatever, whatever you're just showing your hand.  This is like playing poker with a guy that keeps his fucking cards face up.  I don't want to be here anymore.  I want to do the pan.  Like the pan.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  In here.  Wow.  This, uh, they look like yellow light brights. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I don't even know how you put this on.  Let me try to take a picture of Jimmy with the new lights and see what it, uh, comes  out like.  Cause a lot of people have seen the video of, uh, Howard's studio.  Cause it's been making the rounds.  All we have to do is label every picture picture.  No, let me just get Jimmy, get Jimmy, but label every picture on the sun.  And then it's cool.  Like this will be Jimmy on the sun.  Okay.  I'm going to tweet this for everybody so you can see.  Jimmy, it doesn't even really do it justice, you know, but you can kind of tell. 
[00:08:30]  It's yellowish.  You can tell.  But, uh, there's a lot of shadows and Jimmy has a big happy smile.  These lights are more yellow than a yellow submarine's lights or something.  Oh my God.  Yes.  Well, we're working on something.  We're working on something different today.  It's a, these are, you know what these gels are used for when you, when you have like  a, when you have like a rock, a rock concert, I don't even know what they go in front of  the lights that are like a hundred feet over the stage and project these big beams of, 
[00:09:00]  of yellow lights down on the stage.  Right.  That's what these are for.  They're not in any way made for photography or video.  Is that what they're made for?  Really?  Oh, did you get a good one?  Let me see.  You got a good camera.  Is yours better?  I'll take yours.  Oh yeah.  That's that's.  Should we use his?  Just all yellow.  Yeah.  I'll use mine, but then E-Rock Radio will have a couple shots of the lights being used in  the studio.  Wow.  Little Jim Norton bathed.  I'm going to say bathed. 
[00:09:30]  Bathed.  Swatch of yellow light.  Bathed in the new yellow light.  Yes.  It does cover up all of our jaundice from drinking so much and ruining our livers.  Why are you lumping us into that category?  Are you weirdo?  Oh no.  I just saw it because Danny walked out.  Oh, you saw a few other.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I've seen Travis tip a couple.  Yeah.  Travis could knock him back when he needs to.  E-Rock has had a cocktail or two in his day.  Yeah, that's true.  Meat was in it.  In a meat in a martini glass, right? 
[00:10:00]  Yellow lights.  Okay.  All right.  We'll tweet this fucker.  So should we turn off the new lights?  Uh, no.  No.  We should do the whole show distracted up the ass with these fucking lights.  And it gets better because who do you think went and got the new gels for our new studio lights?  I would assume whatever lighting techs they use for a lot of these studios that do have video.  Yeah.  Uh, that's the guy that was sent out. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  But that would make sense because...  You're in the darkness, by the way.  Where are you?  What?  You're in, you're like, you're like the dark side of the moon, man.  Yeah.  The right side of your face is completely in the dark.  It's cool.  This is kind of like, uh, what Beatles album was that?  Meet the Beatles?  Yeah.  Where they're like half in the dark and half in the lights.  Cool.  I think it was Meet the Beatles.  So, um, who wants to step forward and, and, um, claim responsibility for the new horrible yellow gels?  Well, get the lighting tech.  Lighting tech's coming in? 
[00:11:00]  I, I, uh, I got the gels.  Sam.  Our own Samwise Gamche got the, uh, got the gels.  And the beauty of Sam, he started defending himself before we even started talking about the lights this morning.  Like, guys, I know what you're going to say before you say it.  Cause the web lady was in here, like, when we first got the lights and I guess we were experimenting with it a little on the after show on the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she said something.  She was like, yeah, maybe you want yellow gels to match the, you know, like we would leave the studio lights as they are and maybe get yellow gels or something. 
[00:11:30]  I said, okay.  And then I didn't think that I was going to have to get the gels, but then the guys in management said for me to pick out yellow gels.  Oh, boy.  So I said, yeah, all right, I'll pick these out.  But they told you to pick them out or did you say yellow first?  No, they told me yellow.  I mean, the web said maybe yellow.  I said, okay, should I get yellow?  They said, yeah, just put yellow.  But you have no experience in lighting.  No, I don't know. 
[00:12:00]  I didn't know what a lighting gel was.  That's who you want sent out.  People suggesting you're not gelling.  No, I guess I mean, yeah.  So I've never played that to be a...  Safe to say, you have no experience in lighting up a studio.  No, I didn't.  So you went to B&H, which is a beautiful fucking camera place here.  Yeah, but I didn't know where it was before I got these.  Oh, my God, I go there once a month.  I love that place.  I've heard good things, but I have no reason to...  So you wandered around and just said, all right, I need yellow. 
[00:12:30]  Well, I went online and did it.  I just picked colors that I saw on the Internet.  Yeah, that's great then.  Yeah, that's all you need to do.  I have shipped here.  Does it work if we turn on the other lights?  Let's find out.  Let's be fair here, Ed.  Oh, my eyes are burning from the yellow light.  Doesn't even make a difference.  I don't know what it is.  This is the oddest thing, because these lights don't make any sense anyway.  Regardless of what color is coming out of them, 
[00:13:00]  it just don't make sense to have these bright fucking lights like that.  No, of course not.  I worked my entire life to get to this shitty point.  Holy fuck.  Holy fuck.  I was a kid when I started this shit.  This is the shitty point I'm at.  After all these years, it's mind-boggling.  I don't know, Matt.  It doesn't matter anymore.  No.  It just doesn't.  All right.  Can we flip those off?  Can we turn off the yellow lights?  We got a radio show.  It really is just killing me. 
[00:13:30]  I am starting to feel a little nauseous.  It's draining my life here.  It's really...  It's like an interrogation technique.  Yeah.  I think it's the lights they use when you have some kind of vitamin deficiency.  Which one?  Like a D, maybe?  Maybe that.  It's jaundice.  It is, right?  Yeah, it's jaundice.  But I think they make me look better.  Yeah, you like...  Yeah.  It takes away the gray.  They highlight your shirt.  Your face.  So there you go.  I think of them as those lights they put up on the big poles when they do highway work.  Yes.  On the expressway. 
[00:14:00]  Fuck yeah.  When you're driving the other way, you can't see?  Fuck yeah.  So...  Wow.  Just such a simple issue.  We just can't fucking figure out.  It's the coat hanger all over again.  Wanted a dumb coat hanger.  It took months.  There it is.  Because they're worried about how it would fuck up the acoustics of this place.  It's the dumbest thing ever.  I just want to hang up my coat.  It took months.  Winter is almost over when they finally installed it.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  So...  Oh, my God.  That's, uh, the...  That's one of the issues today.  That's one of the issues.  Yeah.  And today, you know what I have to say?  Shucky Ducky, quack, quack.  What?  Wait a minute.  What?  No.  Why would...  Wait a minute.  I got Shucky...  See, my shirt...  Wait.  This is Shucky Ducky, quack, quack, quack, here.  Your days of finger banging...  Oh, no.  ...old Mary Jane Rottencotch through her purty pink panties are over!  But that's just an error.  Look, it's labeled Shucky...  See, I got Shucky Ducky. 
[00:15:00]  Look.  Your days of finger...  No.  That should be Shucky Ducky.  All right.  I got a hamburger.  Here's a hamburger.  Hamburger.  Hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and fuck my sister.  Well, here's what I got.  I love this one.  It's from Caddyshack.  Remember?  Thanks for nothing.  Oh, I love that.  I think that fits here.  Let's hear it.  Like, um...  Like, um...  I just like, um...  How about like, um...  How about like, um...  Like...  Dude, that's mine.  Wait, wait.  What?  I...  Oh!  Oh!  And you know what?  That was in N-Person, so let me play my N-Person clip.  Oh, okay.  What?  I don't have the car crash. 
[00:15:30]  I usually have that.  Let me play my car crash.  Listen to this.  N-Person.  Oh, that's mine.  Wait a minute.  Oh, I get it.  Well, keep fucking that chicken.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in.  What?  Oh, see.  I don't have the Caddyshack clips.  I would love the Caddyshack clips.  Oh, they're great.  Like this one?  Be more funny.  No.  What?  How about this Caddyshack clip?  No!  No, I'm supposed to...  These are all the ones that you have.  Oh, I... 
[00:16:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  Homer.  What happened?  Look, could we do something maybe to make it easier for whoever sets up our little sound  machines in the morning?  Maybe if Opie's name was on his...  Right.  ...and my name was on mine, that would make it easier for...  Oh!  Oh, I see.  It is!  Yeah, the names are on there.  My name is right...  Your name is right there.  I'm looking... 
[00:16:30]  It's right there, plain as day.  I'm looking at your name.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay, who hooked up these today?  Because I have to know who will be the victim of the wrath.  Mars?  Oh, no.  Mars?  That would be me.  Mars.  How long have you been plugging in the instant replays?  Dude, you have no idea what I was going through with these fucking lights and gels this morning,  bro.  Well, I know what you were going through.  By the time...  I know what you were going through.  You were enjoying Jimi Hendrix on YouTube when I came in.  So, I guess you were in a place where all your work was taken care of and you were just 
[00:17:00]  relaxing.  Yeah, that's what you do.  There's nothing wrong with that.  After your computer being fucked up and me not getting any...  Oh, yeah.  My computer is fucked up today, too.  Oh, cool.  I forgot about that already.  And not getting any support on it because the people are not here to...  Hey, we're behind you.  Okay?  Yeah, we love you, Mars.  All right.  So, I did do that mistake and I will fix it right now.  Oh, I just wanted...  Because our names are so prominently on it.  Oh, wait.  As I move one of the templates, I see Opie's name's on it again. 
[00:17:30]  So, your name is actually on here with Weiss.  Mars, get back on mic, though.  How would you do that?  Opie, Opie.  Anthony, Anthony.  Mars looks frazzled, though.  What happened?  The gels got to you?  The fucking gels, man.  You knew damn well it was going to be a problem, right?  Oh, my God.  It's not even close.  If I left it with all the fucking gels on every light...  They wanted them on every light?  They were.  Dude, I had them on every light, man.  It was horrible.  What did it look like?  I mean, it's pretty yellow with just those two. 
[00:18:00]  Like I joined this whorehouse, I guess?  Yeah.  I had no idea they were going to do every single light.  Every light.  There's an engineer that likes hand drugs.  You've got to give them a little break.  They were on every light?  I didn't know that I put them on every light.  Who said to put them on every light?  How insane is that?  I don't know.  Yellow gels?  Yes, sir.  Yellow gels on every light.  So it's been a stressful morning for you already?  Yes, it has.  It really has.  Very stressful.  You know what I have to say to that?  Like, oh, my...  That's mine!  Opie, Opie!  Opie, Opie. 
[00:18:30]  It's Opie, Opie's machine.  That's mine.  Let me say hi to Tony in Florida.  Tony.  Hey, yeah.  Hey, fellas.  Hello.  Hey, banana fan of Fofoni.  Shut it off!  I would cry.  Tony.  Hey, Opie.  You know I'm a great big fan, but I didn't need an explanation.  Oh.  Let me preface this by saying I don't ever want you to leave the show, but...  You know what?  First of all, you douchebag, you fucking cunt. 
[00:19:00]  I knew you were going to yell at me.  Yeah, because you...  Just stop with the shit.  I'm a fan.  I don't want you.  You got to fucking complain.  So what is it?  I hate fucking babies like you.  Go ahead.  I want an explanation.  I want to know, why do you complain?  Isn't this the first time you've ever...  First of all, cunt, I'm not the only one complaining, asshole.  Anthony and Jimmy are in on this one, too, you stupid fuck.  Are you not a millionaire?  So you don't...  I'm a multi-millionaire! 
[00:19:30]  You are.  And I'm going to fucking walk away.  Don't leave.  Please.  I have more complaints, sir.  I just have my...  We haven't gotten to my main issues yet.  Dude, everyone has complaints every fucking day.  Maybe I vocalize more than the rest of the people around here, but everyone has complaints  every fucking day.  Okay?  What's his issue?  I could walk away tomorrow and never work again in my life, but guess what?  I still like doing this shit.  But I want to work for a company that understands the fucking radio show and wants to push it 
[00:20:00]  forward.  We're doing our jobs.  They're not doing theirs.  Okay?  We got yellow lights that are fucking horrendous that we can't even use.  You stupid fuck.  Maybe you don't want anything from your stupid life, but I want a lot from mine, you cunt.  So go fucking away.  Did he say his complaint?  Huh?  What was his complaint?  I don't know.  He wants to say that I'm ungrateful.  Are you serious?  I've worked my entire life on the radio.  I want more for myself and more from the fucking show in general. 
[00:20:30]  More for the show, I should say.  You stupid fuck.  You just want to fucking walk through life and do nothing with it.  That's fine.  But you don't understand where I come from, you cunt.  People have passion for what they do.  You don't, obviously.  Jimmy's pissed off today.  Ann's pissed off today.  We're all pissed off again today.  Yes, we are.  And if you don't like it, go to another fucking channel. 
[00:21:00]  If you don't like it, lump it.  Wow.  That's what I say.  Remember that one?  Yes.  We have a shitty studio, and then we're working with this company.  We're like, all right, at least make the lighting better.  They can't even figure that shit out.  So what?  We're supposed to sit here and be grateful?  Go fuck yourself.  I don't need this shit.  Sam's just got to go to lighting school.  I don't want to go to lighting school.  No, you really should.  How great would that be if that was the upshot of this,  is that they gave Sam less on-air duty  and forced him to go and learn lighting?  That would be the sweetest victory, 
[00:21:30]  is if Sam's on-air,  they took the show away at the end  and gave it to the E-Rocker.  Did I have to go to lighting classes?  Where they only have them from 10 to 11 in the morning?  Right.  Yes.  Oh, boy, would people rejoice.  Oh, I mean, you know.  You'd be upset.  I don't understand these little faggots,  and I don't mean it in a gay way,  that just assumes we should just take everything  and this company's shoving down our fucking asses.  You know, I don't get it.  Yeah.  You know, there's a disrespect  when it comes to this fucking radio show,  and these idiot little faggots out there 
[00:22:00]  think we should just sit back and take it.  Take it up the ass.  Proves that you're a fucking loser in your little life  and don't want anything for yourself or for your career.  So you don't want to understand this,  so shut your fucking mouth.  They don't understand how frustrating.  People understand the frustrations on their own jobs,  but when they hear Radio Guard,  they don't understand that this stuff really,  it genuinely is frustrating.  It's like, it really is.  It's like, you try to get certain things done.  That's just, it really, 
[00:22:30]  you said this morning when I walked in,  I complained about something,  and you're like, it's like swimming upstream,  and it's an old expression,  but that is what it's like.  Every day.  What are we doing?  Look, and I preface it every fucking time.  We have great lives.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Absolutely.  People are working their balls off out there at real jobs.  This has never been a real job,  but when you know what this could be  and it's not happening,  it's really frustrating.  Simple as that.  Yeah.  All right?  And I'm not going to go home and cry or any of that shit.  I've got a great life. 
[00:23:00]  You know, I forget about this place  as soon as 10 o'clock hits.  I really do at this point.  Believe me.  9.45.  I start the wind down of forgetting.  Yeah.  So once again, I will preface and say,  yeah, we've got great gigs.  It's, you know, life could be way fucking tougher than this.  I understand that.  Certainly.  But this company is getting away with murder  and they can't even fucking do the basics  for one of their high-profile shows.  Murder.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had an enjoyable hour after the show yesterday. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, boy.  Tony, this is Jim Norton  and he's now going to complain.  Oh, boy.  So why don't you call back,  you little fucking faggot?  A lot of people, you know, look,  we love the liar on this show  and I think our audience knows  what we've talked about.  It's Michael K. Williams  and, you know, a tremendous amount.  What a great guy.  It's the first time I met him.  Oh, yeah.  We had him on the phone  and the one time he was in,  and I was out that day.  He's a solid dude.  He's fantastic, man.  He's a great guest.  He's just a conversational guy. 
[00:24:00]  He's a great guy to have on.  And we love him.  We love his work  and we promote his work  and, you know, whatever.  It's fun to do because we like him.  Yeah.  So we finally get him back in yesterday  after, what was the last time  we had him on?  Over two years ago.  It was obviously the old studio.  Wow, that was a while ago.  It was the old studio, man.  Yeah.  You didn't do a phone or in between then?  No.  Wow.  I bumped into him in public by chance,  but I mean.  I didn't realize that was that long ago.  That long ago.  So we finally get him in.  He's a little bit late.  We have him scheduled for 9.30.  He comes in about, what, 9.35, 9.40?  Yeah, late. 
[00:24:30]  And we're getting crap  because we have him for like a half hour  because he's supposed to be going on  Sway's show right after ours  and then some other stuff  to promote Boardwalk Empire and Community.  And as it's getting to be  our time is quote-unquote up,  the publicist or whatever is,  I guess Sway is getting,  and again, he's just waiting for his guest.  He's just.  Yeah.  But all of a sudden we're getting rushed.  Like, oh yeah, yeah.  There's this frenzy outside the studio.  Panic.  And we can feel it. 
[00:25:00]  And we can always feel it.  I know they got a schedule  and signal you once in a while.  Yeah.  But then they basically just come in  and kind of grab him out of the studio  so he can go on Sway's show.  It was pretty literally grabbed him out of the studio.  Yeah.  I hope we didn't even get to get a picture with him.  And I know that other people have radio shows.  That's one thing.  But a quick photo with a guy  who we've talked about  and who we've promoted for a long time  I think is fair.  I got one.  I don't need a picture.  I got one.  I really wanted one, to be honest with you.  I know you did. 
[00:25:30]  I never saw him again.  I mean, I could bitch about that for five minutes too.  But, you know, what are you going to do?  But the problem I had was  I talked to some people  who were involved in that  that were not part of this show.  And their job is to make everything run smoothly.  And I get that.  They have a bunch of different shows.  And I'm like, well, couldn't you tell the person?  And I'm honestly not shitting on the other show.  Look, he's talking to a bigger audience here.  He came in late.  He'll be there.  Yeah.  It's like, but some people think  that it's more important  to get everything to run on time 
[00:26:00]  instead of being backed up a few minutes late  on other things  at the expense of...  Do you understand what I mean?  I'm pulling him out of our show.  But meanwhile,  when I was complaining about  they don't pull people out of Howard's studio,  I wasn't shitting on Howard.  That's the way it should be.  That's literally the way it should be.  It's like when he's done an interview,  it's annoying sometimes we've got to wait.  But you know what?  I get it.  If we had the autonomy to do that...  Well, just to help you out a little bit, Jimmy,  we sit around waiting for guests all the time, 
[00:26:30]  and we've never bitched to anyone about it.  All the time.  No.  But I guess some of these other shows,  they'll remain nameless.  I guess they bitch to a point  that everyone gets uptight.  I can't think of one time we ever...  Maybe we have.  I don't know.  But in general, we don't bitch.  We sit here and go,  oh, he's going to be late.  Okay, we'll do something else  until they get here.  No one's ever said,  hey, try to get him at it.  It's understood.  Right.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  And that's after an hour interview.  Like Tony Bennett, we had for 10 minutes.  And again, we knew he'd have him for a few minutes.  But when it's a guy that we have talked about a lot 
[00:27:00]  and who I think we were having a great interview with,  to have him pulled out,  and I said they wouldn't dare walk into Howard's studio.  And they shouldn't.  Why do they feel comfortable kind of just coming in here?  Why do people feel...  And I told them, no more publicists out here.  Fuck them.  From now on, Bladder said we're allowed to use that green room.  I was under the impression we weren't.  But I'm tired of looking out and seeing these exasperated faces while we're trying.  And I know you have to deal with it more than me and Ant do,  because you stare straight out.  You're looking out and outside. 
[00:27:30]  I see the faces.  They're in my peripheral, which is worse sometimes,  because it's like, it's so utterly distracting.  They're brutal, too, because they get all uptight.  It's like, do you understand that your client is being well taken care of in here?  And if we go along with an interview, that's just even better for your client?  And that is exactly what it is.  Exactly what you just said.  But they don't tell the publicists, like, look, they're talking to a...  The publicists are looking at it like, A is running late, so B, C, and D are going to suffer. 
[00:28:00]  And nobody here says to them, and by here, I mean even people not involved with that show,  goes, look, it's a larger audience at this point.  I talked to Blatter yesterday.  I was like, am I just...  Maybe I'm overrating the show.  Maybe because I'm involved with it, I'm close to it, I'm looking at it like it's bigger than it is.  And I said that to him.  I was very honest.  I'm like, if that's what it is, I'm like, I won't even come on the air with it.  Just tell me that.  Right.  And he goes, no.  He goes, they should be looking at it like...  He goes, look, here's the way it is.  You know, Howard is Howard.  You guys.  He goes, and then, you know, certain other shows and whatever. 
[00:28:30]  We're just not being looked at that way.  And I guess maybe I thought maybe we're just being delusional.  It's very frustrating.  He said no.  Maybe we are just a shitty show.  We're not a shitty show, but I mean...  Maybe we should lower our expectations.  Lower expectations.  I'm serious.  Put that bar down a bit.  Maybe we're just a shitty fucking show.  Let's do that.  Let's just shut our mouths.  I'd like to do that.  And, you know, do radio in front of yellow horrendous lights.  How about we just...  And if they want to yank their, you know, fucking celebrities out of here, then let them yank them out. 
[00:29:00]  But it's amazing that...  We just bide our time.  Let's just bide our time.  We used to come in and do a show.  Now we can bide our time.  And just come in and, you know, ah, fuck it.  It's almost, you know, keep looking at the clock and that shit.  And to the guys who think we're just complaining, it's like we had a guest that we love on the show yesterday who's not easy to get in studio.  And this is where it affects the on-air thing because they were comfortable enough to yank him.  And people who were kind of, like, running that were comfortable enough to have him pulled because they had to keep the schedule. 
[00:29:30]  So they looked at...  And again, they looked at this show the same as the next show and the next show.  And I guess in God's eyes they are the same.  But as far as an audience is concerned, they're not.  And he won't say that.  And they won't say that.  It's not one guy.  To the publicist.  No, they'd rather have the quantity of shows instead of the, you know...  Because they...  Yes.  ...quality of appearance.  Because they don't care.  As a performer, you want to go on...  I've had times where I was doing rock radio on the road. 
[00:30:00]  And I had, like, a little independent schedule.  And I would always go do my next interview.  But I'm like, is this the bigger show?  You know, I've asked...  Like, yes.  Why would I fucking walk out?  I've sent the club owners.  Why would you have me walk out of a much larger road?  It doesn't make sense.  Yeah.  And then we stay longer.  And then eventually you go and do the other show.  But that's the frustrating part.  Is that he just got pulled.  And again, Sway is just...  Sway is here till noon.  So it wasn't like...  It was just basically they wanted to keep their schedule. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  And they're looking at the picture of you in the yellow lights right now on Twitter.  They're just amazed.  People are, like, amazed.  And a lot of these guys that usually love making jokes, they're sitting there like, this is a joke, right?  You guys set this up.  I'm like, no, that's what we're trying to tell you.  Barely any jokes coming in.  They're just amazed.  They're like, you can't be serious.  Yeah, those are terrible.  We didn't set it up.  We moved the lights exactly how they should be and turned them on. 
[00:31:00]  And the picture's up on my Twitter.  The light.  This is just mind-boggling.  Lighting tech, Sam.  I just got a tweet from this guy, Kurt Love.  He wrote, the worst thing about your job is they make you hate it.  Ah, that's true.  That's so true, because this is the easiest...  One of the easiest jobs in America.  Yeah.  So it shouldn't be this difficult, and you should never hear his bitch.  I'll be honest, you should never hear his bitch.  No.  But for some reason, they make it so fucking difficult.  I did say it's like swimming up fucking stream every day.  For that to have happened... 
[00:31:30]  I was here for an hour afterwards.  An hour.  And I had to leave.  Oh, and I walked out, and the audio was, of course, playing outside again.  And I had to go...  No, we took care of that months ago.  Yeah.  What's going to happen is somebody...  I had to go and do the Sebastian Bach interview, so I had to leave.  I'm actually glad I had that, because I had to walk out, because I was so angry.  Yeah.  But I stayed for an hour after that.  Yeah.  And I like Blatter, and I know he likes us.  I genuinely think he likes us.  Like, you know, he's really...  He listens, and he wants to help out, and he really does... 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, but the company gave him so many hats to wear.  That's what makes it more difficult.  It makes him look silly walking down the hall.  It's ridiculous.  He puts them all at the same time.  The Lincoln stovepipe one on top.  Yeah.  But he insists...  I'm sorry.  He says I'm wearing the Dodgers hat to the side, because he thinks he looks young and hip,  and no one wants to tell him he looks like an ass.  The Lincoln hat on top.  I got caught avoiding the Big Boss yesterday, too.  Here's the picture. 
[00:32:30]  That is the greatest picture ever.  There it is.  On my Twitter.  Oh, my God.  You look at how it looks.  OP Radio.  But we shouldn't bitch, right?  We should just accept that.  I'll tell you one thing.  That's a great...  I mean, really?  That is a great shot if that's what you're going for.  It's Instagram.  Like, if you want to go for a harsh yellow light on the side of one's face...  Yeah.  ...and then darkness on the other side...  We got it.  ...it's a cool shot.  But that isn't what we were looking for.  We figured out Instagram.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  For you iPhone users.  That's it.  With lighting.  Amazing.  And I saw the big guy yesterday, and you fell into his trap.  I've walked all the way around to avoid him.  And then other people noticed what I was doing.  I'm like, look, I don't know what to tell you, but I can't talk to the guy anymore.  Because he...  I ran through the cycle yesterday.  You don't care.  I hit for the cycle.  What do you mean?  I got them all.  I hit for the cycle.  Oh, wait.  Every single fucking one of them.  You went from single A ball all the way up to the majors?  All the way up to the majors.  Dude, I went from a single to a home run. 
[00:33:30]  And I got...  You touched them all.  Right when I got out of here, actually, right before I left, I had a bladder, right?  And then I guess it was...  Who was next?  Was Cross next?  All I know is I ended, yeah, with the big guy down the hall there.  And then as I got into the elevator, I pretty much just collapsed against the back wall of  the elevator.  Like, holy shit.  What is it about that guy?  He will... 
[00:34:00]  I avoided him because I didn't want to be in a bad mood for at least a day.  Oh, my God.  That's what happens.  I'm not in a bad mood after yelling and screaming at Tony.  I'm fine now.  It's easy.  But that guy, because I just know he doesn't listen and just says, I got it a lot.  He doesn't care or see it our way.  I didn't care.  I saw the elevator door open and I was just like...  Do you even know what he was telling you?  Freedom!  That's what I yell.  Like, fucking Braveheart every day when I get in the elevator.  What do you tell you?  Anything? 
[00:34:30]  No, it was something about, you know, some gigs we got going on.  Is it the whole cursing thing again about how they don't want us to be an XL channel  anymore and it's like, stop cursing?  Sorry.  That would be a good one.  Oh, shit.  I got allergies.  No, we're not raising...  Walk in here and just fucking...  We're not raising snakes and lizards in the studio.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking terrarium lighting.  Now the jokes are coming in.  Because they said they weren't coming in.  Now the jokes are coming in. 
[00:35:00]  A terrarium.  It does look nice.  How much are those lights in?  The lights themselves?  Yeah.  I don't know.  We checked once.  Yeah, I think it was $2,500 a piece or something like that.  They're pretty expensive.  Yeah.  They're very expensive lights.  All right, then let me think it over.  I didn't know they were $2,500.  Oh, no.  How much?  Let me think it over.  I think around $2,500 I would.  I think.  Let me think it over.  A piece.  I would.  Let me think it over.  Oh.  You're insurance.  Let me think it over. 
[00:35:30]  I've been looking a pill for a couple of these for a while now.  Yeah, because you would set them up properly.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'd put the proper gels in them, right?  Well, I like the proper gels that I have.  Need a lighting guy?  I got one.  Oh.  Me?  Would it come over?  That's all I need.  I like that yellow light.  I kind of miss it.  Yeah, well.  You want it back on?  It was literally like walking into an illness.  You like it because it's yellow.  Yeah.  I kind of like that color.  Makes me thirsty.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  I like that it doesn't cast too many shadows in that photo either.  Holy shit.  Everything has a shadow that's 12 feet long.  It feels like he's walking into a beaker of piss.  That is what it looks like.  It looks like.  Piss, Jimmy.  Yeah.  It looks like an art display at Piss, Jimmy.  Really?  Let's get this in the MoMA.  Let's get that photo in the MoMA.  It says Piss, Jimmy.  That's funny.  People are outraged.  You take that.  You just got to crop it a little bit where you can't actually see the light.  That's funny.  Piss, Jimmy.  Piss, Jimmy.  They want to know if you're okay because your color looks off today, Jimmy.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  But that's it.  I mean, you know, we didn't set it up.  That's why we bitch.  You can see it for yourself if you like.  How is that acceptable?  And how are you sending Sam to get the lights?  He doesn't know anything about Google and lights.  They just tell him yellow.  He gets yellow.  He doesn't know.  I'm not going to sit here and blame young Samuel.  But that's when, you know, you don't really give a fuck what your guys are saying to you.  So you just kind of throw that job to somebody else.  Like, well, you just fucking go down there and get a fucking filter.  The guy himself should be going down there and asking a lot of questions. 
[00:37:00]  What else does he have to do?  Schedule a music log?  Get the fuck out of here.  Go get us our stupid lights.  Hey, gosh.  I was very bothered yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Still?  Oh, yeah.  I'm still bothered.  I'm not angry.  I'm still bothered by it, though.  Yeah.  Because it's...  Jimmy spent a lot of his afternoon dealing with that issue.  Yeah.  It's very frustrating that that could happen.  That that...  That that could happen. 
[00:37:30]  When I was walking out, and this is how mad Jimmy is and how, like, like, I'm not used  to angry Jimmy, like, and to that extent, he was interviewing Sebastian Bach in the studio  there when I was walking by, and it's all glass studios.  We all know that here.  And I was just going to bang on the fucking window real hard and go, like, fuck your interview  up a little bit, but I was like, I'm not even fucking going to fuck with Jimmy right now. 
[00:38:00]  I wouldn't have been mad at you for that.  I wouldn't have laughed.  I wouldn't have been mad at you guys.  In the middle of doing something, just dong, dong, dong, dong, outside.  But I was just like, you know what?  I'm just going to walk past.  No, I would have been okay with that.  It was...  I'm glad I had that.  I literally was glad I had that for schedule, because this way I had to not keep yelling,  and I had to focus on that.  See?  Jimmy's yelling, too.  I just, I guess, bring it more to the fucking air than Jimmy and Ant, but trust me. 
[00:38:30]  I didn't yell after, but I was, I mean, on the air, I could feel myself, and I didn't  even know, as I was, like, starting to get heated at the very end, I didn't know that  the show was on in the hallway.  Yeah, which we've always said, just don't do that, because it's nothing but trouble.  It's a disaster.  Waiting to happen.  Waiting to happen.  And everybody's telling me, like, you know, no, no, it's handled, it's handled, but I've  been literally told that for months.  We know how things are dealt with here, with management and HR and just things like that, 
[00:39:00]  and I just think it's detrimental to have our show on, because we say things that are  pretty nasty sometimes.  The listeners are one thing, but the people you work with are another, so if someone's  walking by, they hear something...  And it almost happened one time, and I'm not worried about a listener, because you're  listening to this show.  I'm not worried about you guys, or anybody who's even offended by this at all, I could  care less.  Everyone's offended by it.  I would hope so.  It's mean, and it's awful.  But if somebody's walking by, if somebody's walking by, even if we're not commenting... 
[00:39:30]  Imagine if a black guy's walking by, or a woman is walking by, and you're doing a rape  joke.  Boo!  Yeah.  Oh, what?  Well, if it was a woman, we wouldn't recognize her.  What is that thing with the lumps on her shirt?  Oh, it's a gal.  But it was like, imagine if she thinks that we're talking about her.  And I know it sounds crazy, but in a corporate environment that stuff happens, I don't want  to deal with human resources.  They're never going to side with us.  I should be able to walk down the hallways and not have that.  It's like, oh boy, we were just doing a show. 
[00:40:00]  Why was the sound on?  What the fuck?  I've mentioned it.  I've literally wanted to break those things out there, but I can't.  Or unplug them.  And a lot of times, Roland will give them headphones for the publicist.  Okay, I understand that.  Yeah, if the publicist wants to hear their fucking client or something.  From now on, no more publicist in this studio.  I don't care who they're with.  Yeah.  I don't care.  I asked some people yesterday, like, yeah, it doesn't let them in the studio, right?  I've never been in his studio.  Yeah.  I didn't think he did.  And I'm like, no.  No, no more.  From now on, it is only the artist. 
[00:40:30]  Unless it's somebody we have a relationship with and we like the publicist.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, that's Greg from Caroline.  All right.  Of course.  But no more of these people in the studio.  I don't want it anymore.  And I would rather not take the guest.  I literally.  Well, that would mean Gary has to fucking do his job and get that done.  Oh, boy.  We name names.  Gary, I guess, oversees his channel.  Then if this is an issue for the show, which it is, and especially for Jimmy, then he's got  to fucking get it done. 
[00:41:00]  We've been talking about this over and over again.  Get it done.  Set policy.  Make sure this shit doesn't turn on outside the studio.  Let's go.  Let's move forward.  And no more.  If we could use that green room.  From now on, all the publicist people wait in the green room.  All their people wait.  Oh, they'll love that.  I don't care.  I don't either.  I could care less.  More importantly, they're calling you mellow yellow today there, Jim.  Oh.  Little Donovan from yesterday.  I ordered Jimmy whites and I got Jimmy. 
[00:41:30]  Can I get it?  Hey, why can't I get him yellow?  Yes.  That's going to be tonight's sunset picture on my Twitter, by the way.  Just from the studio.  That's all you need.  I literally look like I'm basking on the beach in Tampa tomorrow through Saturday.  Oh, boy.  How you turn lighting controversy into a great plug for a great show is amazing. 
[00:42:00]  All right.  Well, well.  Well, what are you doing there?  Michael was fun yesterday.  He really was.  Wasn't he a great man talking about Brooklyn and stuff?  I fucking love that guy.  I was amazed to find out that his mom never saw him on the wire.  I couldn't believe that.  I thought about that all day yesterday.  Yeah, that mom thing was really fucking cool.  Like, holy shit.  A hit fucking show your son made good and you can't watch.  Yeah.  Because it's too real to her.  That's why.  She just doesn't want to see him like that.  She saw that shit for real when she was coming up with. 
[00:42:30]  Like, my baby.  Right.  She doesn't want her baby on.  She was in the projects for, what, 50 years or something?  50 years.  That's too real for her.  Yeah.  Even though it's her son.  It was nice to see his relationship with his mom.  That was a fun interview.  And Sebastian was great.  We were having a great time.  Did you notice how Sebastian and he yanked out?  Like, he had to go and that was it?  Yeah.  There was no fucking person running in and...  Yeah.  They got to stop with shoving so many shows down, you know, these guys' throats.  They do.  There's no leeway in between shows. 
[00:43:00]  When you are handled as one of X amount of shows and you're looked at in the exact same  light as one of X amount of shows, that's what happens.  They feel comfortable doing that or they feel like they have to do that.  Yeah.  And I know it sounds like, hey, how come you're saying this stuff?  That's the type of stuff Howard would say about your show and you don't like it.  Yeah, I understand that.  But the reality is I actually go out and do publicity on other shows.  Right.  Most radio guys don't get a chance to do that.  Right.  So I know what it's like when you know you're talking to a larger audience. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  You want to stay there.  Of course.  I've never wondered once why wouldn't Ben Stiller...  We've never even said, even when we were annoyed, why doesn't a guest leave Howard  early and come here?  Even when we were mad, Jonah Hill didn't come in.  No one said, why didn't he walk out early?  Right.  We're not dumb.  Well.  Not for that reason.  We're dumb for other reasons.  Can we play Coldplay Yellow today?  I'm feeling a little yellow today.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Yellow.  Nothing but yellow songs today.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We got Yellow Submarine. 
[00:44:00]  We got Yellow by Coldplay.  Any other yellow songs?  We're going to go to break with a little bit of this.  A little yellowish.  We'll get some Beatles maybe later.  Yellow Lead Better.  Yellow Lead Better.  Nice.  All right.  We'll be back.  We'll be back. 
[00:44:30]  We'll be back.  Look at.  Look at the stars.  Look how they shine for you.  Everything you do.  Yeah, they were all yellow.  I came along.  I wrote a song for you 
[00:45:00]  And all the things you do  And it was called Yellow  Sirius XM, the virus  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony  It was an itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny yellow polka dot bikini  That she wore for the first time today  An itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny yellow polka dot bikini 
[00:45:30]  So in the locker she wanted to stay  Two, three, four, stick around, we'll tell you more  No thanks  No thanks  Today's theme is yellow  But it was a white polka dot bikini  Why would she be singing yellow polka dot bikini?  Oh, because she was in here  Oh, so the white turned yellow  I get it now  A lot of yellow songs today for everybody  Yeah  You got another one queued up there in York?  Anything good to play or something? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, well, of course  Yellow led better  Nice  Right when I got in the truck this morning  This was on?  To leave?  No  Pearl Jam Station?  No  Our station was on  And it was like the first thing out of there was chip  I just, I was still like rubbing my eyes  And just started my truck up  And it's like, yeah, what's that? 
[00:46:30]  I was just, and I'm like, oh god, Jesus  The first thing I hear in the morning is chip  And yes, it was on because the shit show was on  Oh boy  On my drive home  You're obsessed with the shit show  Why are you so obsessed with it?  I don't know, because I feel that it is a show that I can  Really criticize, get angry about, and then call into to yell 
[00:47:00]  A lot of shows, you listen to it and you're like  I'm never going to get through or whatever  But this, I can actually call up and just bitch out  Whoever's saying something really stupid  And that's usually on a daily basis  Great  There  Is that for a promo, you fucking hump? 
[00:47:30]  Why don't you like that voice there?  I like this  I fucking love the Eddie Vedder, man  I love him, but this is good, too  He's got a cool voice  I said there's only a few, though, that I do like  I can't go too deep with the Pearl Jam  Yeah  All right, fair enough  Too deep with the Pearl Jam  Hey, remember yesterday we had that hockey guy 
[00:48:00]  Flyers Simmons  Stupid Steve Avery  Sean Avery  Sean Avery  Sean Avery  They only say in the article a gay slur  But it was either fag or faggot  We can handle language, people  So you can write that in the article  It was faggot, right?  It was fucking faggot  Fucking faggot  So Flyers Simmons talks to NHL about a alleged slur of Rangers Avery  I'm not sure if this is the latest on this  So look it up, Sam  If a stern phone call is all Wayne Simmons gets 
[00:48:30]  He'll be lucky  Whoa, really?  They're thinking of  The Flyers winger who allegedly called Sean Avery a gay slur Monday night  Was contacted Tuesday by NHL Vice President Colin Campbell  By the way, I was wrong about Sean Avery  Colin Campbell  And a lot of hockey fans called me out on it  And they were absolutely correct  I said he was an enforcer  And he really isn't  No?  An enforcer  He's not a goon?  He kind of causes problems  But then he doesn't really fight his way out of the problems 
[00:49:00]  With a pinch or a slap?  He certainly fights  But he's not like a typical enforcer in hockey  Yeah  So these people are absolutely right  He's kind of just a dick  Oh, really?  Yeah, he just kind of fucking gets in there  But then kind of never really goes all in or all the way  A lot of the times, I should say  A leaked source said nothing has been decided  But didn't rule out that Simmons could face some sort of disciplinary action  Ooh  A non-playing infraction such as this carries a maximum penalty of $2,500 
[00:49:30]  Uh-oh  Talking to reporters in Philly on Tuesday  Simmons denied that he used any sort of slur  Oh, boy, you can't deny that  Deny?  You can see the video  Yeah  You can't hear it  But his mouth is mouthing out fucking faggot  You could see it  Of course  He asked me if I called him a gay slur  And I said no  Simmons said of his phone call with Campbell  I said a lot of other things  But that wasn't one of them  There are a lot of things I said to him  And obviously I'm not going to repeat them 
[00:50:00]  But I didn't say that to him  That's bullshit  Yeah  He's lying there  What else could fucking faggot  It looks like fucking faggot  But what else could it be  Yeah  I don't know  Can we look at that again, Sam?  If you can probably find it within the 10 o'clock hour  Sam's got an update on the story too, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It says he won't be disciplined  Because Colin Campbell didn't have enough evidence to take any actions against him  He only had the video, right?  He can't prove it  Well, first of all, I applaud the NHL that that's it  And so Glad could go away and go find someone else to go after 
[00:50:30]  Secondly, they should be able to say faggot on the ice, sorry  It's a vicious sport  Yeah  You want these guys to play in a vicious sport and beat the shit out of each other  And hit each other in ways that is just inhuman  They could still fight  But their language has to be clean?  That doesn't make sense  Yeah  That's silly  It's stupid  Oh  Tell Glad to go away, NHL  Oh, he can't find it 
[00:51:00]  What's he doing?  Oh, what?  He can't find it  They might have taken it off the internet though, man  You can't take anything off the internet completely  It's got to be lingering somewhere in some deep, dark corner  True  Can I say my left nostril right now feels like somebody has taken a heap of shit  And fucking hit it up my nostril with a mallet  Yeah  I'm so, I'm wearing off afferents, I'm sorry  Mine is like, I feel like there's feathers in my nostril 
[00:51:30]  Yes, that's what it feels like  I'm all like  I think I just need a good schnoz blow  Yeah  You got it in there?  I think that's it  All right, I bought that sound  Do you?  All right, here he goes, right here  Hey, fucking faggot  That's it  He goes, hey, fucking faggot  You can see it  So obvious 
[00:52:00]  It looked more like nitwit to me  Oh, did it?  Yeah  You fucking nitwit  Oh, let's see  Go ahead  Let me see if I can see it  You clunking dimwit  Yeah  Yeah  Fucking nitwit  Oh, that's faggot  Wow  That's faggot  Wow  I'll bet you that he watched that tape of himself 50 times  To figure out what else his mouth could look like it was saying  What else could have been he's saying?  Yeah  That's something  But he's probably lucky there's no real audio  Right  You know?  Yeah  And that's why the NHL said, all right, let's fucking move on 
[00:52:30]  I called him a fathead hat witch  That doesn't  We'd fine you for that  For being unfunny  We're heading toward a place where the NHL has to deal with GLAAD  Oh my  You gotta be kidding me  Everyone's gotta deal with GLAAD  No  Not everyone  Whole new world  I do my meetings  Let me say hi to Kirby in Canada  Kirby  Hey, what are you doing?  Laying by the grass or something?  Hi there, lovers  I wanted to know 
[00:53:00]  Is Avery in trouble because it was caught on tape?  It can't be the first time the word fag's been spilled out on the ice  Of course not  Yeah, tell enthusiasm me to call and tell him something  Of course not  Someone's saying it could be fucking maggot  Ah, no  No, because maggot's closed  Fag  That mouth was open  Yeah, that was different  And he was yelling it so you could really see like his lips and teeth moving  In a way where 
[00:53:30]  You know, you could read  It doesn't take that  That much talent to read those lips  He should talk behind his hand like Pesci and Frank Vincent  Yeah  In Casino  I'd sit on that dumb fucking bus bench  Simple as this  Avery can't be a prick on the ice if he can't deal with people saying faggot  You can't have it both ways  Simple as that  Right?  You know what?  There's a difference between yelling it from the box like that  And skating past him and fucking going 
[00:54:00]  Hey, you faggot  Something like that  I bet he gets it 20 times a game  Well, can we go back to the famous Wisniewski clip from last year?  Oh boy, that might be tough  Yeah  Sam  With Kirby  Where he did the international sign for blowjob right in front of him  How's it going?  That was hilarious  Yeah  It was Wisniewski  He got penalized pretty good for that  They all just  I forgot to find any  I forgot  It's a classic clip 
[00:54:30]  Like, yeah  Wait, what is the title of this?  This is  Wisniewski imitating Sean Avery's mother  See, that's a guy that doesn't understand shit  You don't get it  No, Wisniewski was going with the rumor  Yes  Like, oh, really?  You want to be a fucking pest?  Look what I do now  Oh, he said Foghat  Thank you, Trucker Bob  Oh  He's angry that Avery likes 
[00:55:00]  Fucking Foghat  He was just, like, psyched  He's angry that  No, he's angry that Avery likes the band Foghat  Oh, yeah?  Yeah  Oh, I thought he was cheering on Foghat  Who was probably going to be playing at the Coliseum or something  Possible  Very possible  Yeah  It certainly is  All right, so the NHL's moving on from that  That's good news  Yeah  Yeah  That's good news  I, uh, finally was able to, um, find a good theater to go see Contagion last night 
[00:55:30]  Where was it?  Uh, it was in a nice neighborhood  Where?  That's, uh, I was just looking for a  I think Sam went specifically  Yeah  I don't know the exact place  If you found a nice theater, we all want to know about it  Well, let me tell you something  Yeah, where is it?  The movie came out a couple weeks ago, I guess  And, uh, it's just been so hard to find a good theater  That has been one of the most difficult movies to find a really good theater to see it in  It plays in all the theaters  What's the movie about?  Nah, I like a good theater  What's the movie about? 
[00:56:00]  It's, uh, a flu, uh, kind of takes over the whole world there and kills a lot of people  And, you know, they gotta try to come up with a cure  Oh, boy  You know that old gag  Yeah  So get Marion Cabretti  Marion Cabretti  That's a great movie  I'm the cure  That and Judge Dredd  You're the disease  I'm the cure  Oh, Contagion  Contagion, yes  It's getting good reviews, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It's getting good reviews  Actually, it's getting better reviews from the, uh, critics than it is the public  That's kind of rare 
[00:56:30]  It's usually the other way  I found it to be a little slow  I'll be honest with you  What do the other people in the theater think?  Uh, they, they, they  That's a good question, Sam  They liked it  Packed house  Um, I would say  Let me think, wait a minute  Yeah, it was like, uh  No, there wasn't that many people in it 
[00:57:00]  No?  Percentage-wise  Pretty good  It was pretty good  Like, the theater was probably  I don't know, maybe  Ten percent full  Oh, that's not that good, then  That means two people  I mean  No, no  It depends on the size of the theater  Is it Long Island, or?  Yeah, yeah  Long Island  I don't want to go driving, uh, too far  Or, uh, at all  Uh, to, to really, you know  Go see that  But it was, uh, it was very, it was very, uh, uh 
[00:57:30]  It moved a little slow in some parts  And then it was kind of, uh  But it was kind of compelling  That whole, uh, whole disease thing  I mean, uh, uh, when, uh  Gwyneth Paltrow gets, gets sick  That's pretty fucking twisted  And then, like, Matt Damon's the husband  Yeah  And he's just kind of like  Alright, well  The doctor is telling him shit  Like, you know  Hey, uh  Don't believe me  You know she dies right from the beginning  So it's not a big spoiler 
[00:58:00]  In the trailer, too  There was a clip of that on, uh  Dimitri Martin did a clip of it on the Tonight Show  So yes, it is  Yeah, and it's just, uh  Like, the doctor tells him  You know, hey, she was in here  And, um  Right  You know, we tried  And she's, and  And Matt Damon's just staring there  And he's like  Um, could  So, when can we go home?  Like, he's so fucked up  Oh, really?  Yeah, that was  Can I talk to her?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I just, when can I talk to her?  And it's like  Oh, gee  Oh, wow  Oh, that's fucking brutal  That was kind of brutal  She's dead 
[00:58:30]  Yeah  Well, she's dead  Yeah, can I tell you  Alright, she's one of the  But that was so cool  Just not hearing the information  He was being told is great  Yeah, he didn't hear a word of it  He's a good actor, Matt Damon  He's an asshole  I like Matt Damon  He's pretty good  I like his dumb movies  Mm-hmm  And, um  This one, like I said  A few parts started moving a little slow  Uh  Brr  I liked the, uh  Another movie I watched last night  Was, um  Is it  Double Feature?  Yeah, Double Feature  Is, uh  Unthinkable  Is that the one it's called?  With, um  With Samuel L. Jackson? 
[00:59:00]  No, it's Jungle Fever, I think  No  Unthinkable?  Yeah  Samuel L. Jackson?  Movie  I liked that one  Come in, she doesn't  I was rooting for, um  More death, torture, and destruction  In parts where  The movie is supposed to make you feel  Some sympathy  And, uh  I liked the bad guys  Sometimes you just watch a movie  and you're like, yeah, I'd rather have people 
[00:59:30]  getting killed.  Especially the children at one part.  I really wanted children to be  killed in this movie.  I know, it's just one of those things.  I liked it. That got a shit  fucking review.  Fucking Trinity was  in it. Motherfucker? Yeah?  Yeah, Trinity.  Samuel L. Jackson yelling  in anything is good. Motherfucker!  I'm in.  66% of the audience  liked it. 
[01:00:00]  No critics reviews.  No critics reviews? That's odd.  Oh, well.  I double featured it last night.  That was kind of cool.  I would recommend Contagion.  I would recommend Contagion.  You would recommend it.  Some parts are a little...  You like that Quintus Paltrow?  She wasn't in it all that much.  But, no, I don't like her.  You don't like her?  To be honest with you,  no, I don't like her.  Who's her mother? 
[01:00:30]  There are a bunch of people in it.  Who's her mother?  Bly the Danner.  Yeah, from Meet the Parents.  And her dad is who?  Just a regular...  Her dad's dead.  Is he dead?  Mm-hmm.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  There's an actor, too.  Oh, okay.  I forgot his name, though.  She's pretty, right?  Paltrow?  Yeah.  Did she used to bang Brad Pitt?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  But Brad Pitt...  Gwyneth.  Brad Pitt didn't like the tiny tits.  Wouldn't mind smooching with Gwyneth.  He moved on.  Gwyneth's a tall, lanky girl.  Yeah, a tall drink of water.  I would hug her from the back. 
[01:01:00]  Like, I would lay on my side  and hug her thighs  and just make out with her asshole.  Jesus.  Oh, those are some sexy pictures of her.  Yeah, yeah.  Sexy pictures.  We got a phone call coming in  with capital letters.  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah, it's me, Bobo.  There's some haters  posting fake pictures on Twitter.  What are you talking about?  Pictures.  What are you talking about?  Pictures of what?  Fake pictures of me next to Howard.  Those are fake pictures. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, no.  Let's see them.  Wait a minute.  And where is this?  Let's go to Twitter.  I think...  Okay, there's a new rule  going down today.  Bobo, I officially unfollowed you.  And anyone that adds me  to a Bobo tweet  will be unfollowed.  I can't...  Wow.  I can't deal with a timeline  filled with fucking Bobo  fucking tweets.  Yes.  I'm done.  I'm done with it.  You guys have fun with Bobo  and make sure he kills himself someday, 
[01:02:00]  but I don't want any part of it.  Yikes.  Leave my name out of your fucking tweets  to Bobo, please.  Please.  What are the fake pictures, Bobo?  You know, there were fake pictures  of me next to Howard  that some fan posted  just to get me in trouble.  Oh, but in trouble with who?  Oh, you guys.  Why would we care?  Why would we care?  Yeah, that'd be a great gig for you  if you get on Howard.  Yeah, if you did that,  that's fucking huge.  Why wouldn't you want to be on Howard?  They treat him very well around here. 
[01:02:30]  Yes.  No, those photos are fake.  Yeah, but who cares?  Where are they?  You think we give a shit?  Do you think we look at those pictures  and go like, oh, boy, that's it?  How would you get in trouble?  Those fake photos, right?  Hold on, we're trying to find them.  I don't even know where the photos are, Bobo.  I didn't even see these photos.  Those pictures I was posting.  They were freaking posting it all over Twitter.  I heard about it.  Is that a lummox on the phone?  Where are those photos I was supposed to see? 
[01:03:00]  Eric, didn't you post it, Eric?  I retwitted it, but it's not showing up here.  Hang on.  Oh, boy.  Why, E-Rock?  What are you doing?  By the way, I think that means Obie should block E-Rock.  I think so, too.  Oh, that's right.  E-Rock's question, Bobo.  Wait a minute.  Did you add Bobo to the tweet?  Yes, you were tweeting, Bobo.  You just said add you to it.  Block E-Rock, definitely.  Absolutely.  Block.  Do it to block Eric?  It was just a picture of pad data, right?  Yeah.  Is that what it was, Eric?  No, somebody, it's Bobo standing next to Howard in the studio. 
[01:03:30]  More finding, less describing.  How could you not find these pictures?  It's Twitter.  Seems to be a link.  Bobo, we can't even find the pictures.  Yeah, you're calling up about pictures that aren't even really on there.  Where are they?  No one's talking about them.  I wouldn't know about this.  I didn't even know until we took this phone call.  When did you meet Howard, though?  How'd you meet him?  I never did.  But there's pictures of you online.  Everybody's talking about him.  Yeah, but someone for... 
[01:04:00]  Right, exactly.  So, uh...  Oh, right.  And anybody could make those fake photos, all right?  How do they make fake photos?  That's impossible.  So why...  But why all of a sudden have you lined up with Howard, though?  Wow.  No, that isn't true.  Don't...  These idiots are making fake photos, all right?  You could do just about anything.  Fair enough.  No, you can't.  Bobo, you have the right to be with anybody you want to.  And if you're not interested in being on this show anymore, that's fair enough.  I mean, we accept that.  No, I am.  I am, all right? 
[01:04:30]  It's just someone keeps posting those fake photos, all right?  All right.  I'm expecting it to E-Rock who hates me.  I can't click on links over here, you dummies.  They're sending me the links.  Yeah, and if Bobo wants to be on Howard's show...  What day were you on, though?  I didn't hear it.  I was never on.  I was never on.  Well, there's apparently photos of you and him online.  Yeah, but those are fake.  Someone superimposed my face.  Either that or they have another...  Or they have a guy named Bobo.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:05:00]  But it's you.  Where are the photos?  Okay, this one E-Rock posted.  Where are the photos?  Just email us for me.  There's photos.  Someone's posting some fake photos.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good, nice photo of you and Howard in his studio.  Oh, wow.  Wow, that's a pretty good picture.  Yeah, I wouldn't want a picture with Howard.  How'd you get that?  Yeah.  I don't have him yet.  Bobo did the show.  That's a fake photo.  That was after you did the show?  I've never...  What'd you guys talk about? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, what did he ask you?  That's pretty fucking good.  Because I've never been...  That's a good Photoshop.  I've never been anywhere in that.  He didn't even hear that we already acknowledged it's a Photoshop, but...  Yes, Bobo, I got it.  He doesn't do, like... </pre>
