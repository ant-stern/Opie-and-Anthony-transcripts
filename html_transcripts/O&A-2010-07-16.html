<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting abruptly between them.  It began with the hosts discussing Anthony's lateness, blaming a car accident on the LIE or Grand Central Parkway, prompting Opie to share his own car-rolling experience (while being chased, not drunk). This led to a rant about bad New York City drivers. A caller, "Rape Kit," called in to discuss Louis C.K.'s controversial comments on NPR's *Fresh Air* and the subsequent suspension of the show, prompting the hosts' usual disdain for NPR.  The Yankees' failure to attend their longtime PA announcer Bob Shepard's wake sparked outrage and a broader discussion about athlete behavior.  An article criticizing double standards in media coverage of ethnic jokes (using an ESPN British Open example) fueled further debate. The show then tackled Apple's iPhone 4 antenna issue and the ensuing controversy surrounding Steve Jobs, interspersed with a humorous aside about a mysterious woman seen outside the studio, involving speculation about a studio intern and contributions from Travis (in the booth) and Danny (doing hallway reconnaissance).  A producer was also involved in the discussion.

The next segment opened with banter about musician Troy Kwan, whose metal version of "Smile and Blow Me" was playing on SiriusXM.  His unusual hairstyle and the hosts’ discussion of Mel Gibson and allegedly doctored leaked tapes followed.  A supposed clitoris-shaped UFO sighting in China led to a segment of Mel Gibson audio mashups using profanity and racial slurs, created by the show's producers.  The hosts then harshly criticized Lynn Stewart, a lawyer imprisoned for aiding Omar Abdel-Rahman, using highly offensive language.  The discussion returned to the BP oil spill and the iPhone 4 antenna, criticizing Apple’s business practices.  A caller discussed the iPhone 4 antenna problem and the iChatR app, leading to conversations about explicit content found within it. Another caller complained about an XM SkyDoc accessory's incompatibility with the iPhone 4. Studio guest Bob Kelly joined, discussing his experiences, including a terrible bone marrow meal and an upcoming fishing trip, along with commentary on current fashion (yoga pants) and sex in pools/hot tubs, all laced with crude and offensive language. Kelly also discussed his recent role in an episode of *Louie*.

A segment heavily focused on sexually explicit topics and online pornography followed.  A Tony Award-winning actress was mentioned negatively concerning unprofessionalism on a film set. The hosts and Bobby Kelly discussed various pornography websites (including girlsinyogapants.com and girlcamramirror.tumblr.com), with extremely graphic and sexually explicit commentary. Kelly promoted his upcoming stand-up shows at the Helium Comedy Club in Philadelphia.  They also discussed a news story about a woman falsely reporting a carjacking to cover up a car accident while performing oral sex, their experiences with Chat Roulette, and Kelly's "shiny dick" condition in graphic detail.  More Mel Gibson remixes were mentioned, and Kelly complained about smaller Jimmy Dean sausage packages. The language used was extremely vulgar and offensive, containing misogynistic, homophobic, and racist remarks.

A segment with recurring guest Dr. Steve followed, focusing on penile ailments (including Zoon's plasmacell balanitis), genital hygiene, the dangers of leaving wet swimwear on, STIs, and the varied appearances of vaginas across different ages.  Graphic descriptions and humorous anecdotes were used. A picture of a severely damaged vagina was discussed, along with speculation on its cause.  A supposed Mel Gibson assault was discussed with graphic detail, followed by a vintage song with explicit lyrics about female genitalia. A near-physical altercation between the hosts was also mentioned, and the segment concluded with a discussion of the physiques of past Superman actors.  The overall tone was highly vulgar and sexually explicit.

The final segment began with an unclear anecdote about a taser.  Mel Gibson's domestic violence situation and Oksana Grigorieva's alleged extortion attempt were discussed, using highly offensive language.  A repulsive "Aquarius Spring" water taste test led to vulgar jokes.  A significant portion focused on remixes by listener "D-Boy," featuring Mel Gibson and Norton's mother, with offensive and humorous dialogue. D-Boy's successful BP stock sale before the oil spill was discussed, followed by a "Homeless Roulette" game.  Another water taste test and more discussion of D-Boy's remixes and Kelly's comedy shows ensued.  Kelly performed a vulgar freestyle rap. The show concluded with plugs for an Olivia Munn interview, a visual of a fan masturbating on a live chat app, and a discussion of a physical altercation between Opie and a producer.  Throughout the entire broadcast, vulgar and offensive language was prevalent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yeah, come on. Bring it on.  You know what? I think this is hilarious.  A whole big bunch of fun.  The greatest show on satellite radio today.  This show is like the box of chocolates  that Forrest's mother was talking about. 
[00:00:30]  You're a no-good son of a bitch, Bob.  You motherfuckers.  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  What's going on?  I do what I'm told.  I'm completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on. It's shocking.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Anthony, we tried.  Anthony's in a major panic. 
[00:01:00]  Driving on sidewalks.  It is Escalade.  We did what's called padding in the business.  But Anthony's still out there dealing with traffic.  And he was yelling and screaming on the phone.  Not at me, but just in general.  Saying, if I'm not there on time,  I'll get in trouble.  It's like going to school.  He has a legitimate reason for being late.  Overturned vehicle on, where the hell? 
[00:01:30]  The LIE or the Grand Central Parkway.  So he's in a major panic trying to get here on time.  So we're doing the right thing.  We tried to pad a little bit, but we just ran out of time.  But who drives that badly in the morning that the car overturns?  How do you do that this early?  I don't know how you overturn a car in general.  I mean, maybe when it's icy.  Sure, I get it.  But there's nothing going on out there today, right?  There's no real weather.  It could be going around somebody. 
[00:02:00]  Although...  It's not weather, but I mean, at this time of the morning,  all the drunks and stuff is going on.  All the drunks, you're right.  Danny beat me to it,  but that's the one thing you learn about when you do morning radio.  You get to see all the horrendous car accidents.  Average people wake up at another hour or two.  But the news always starts with the most horrific car crash of the night.  And you're right.  It's probably someone that was coming home late.  And you know what, too?  That flipped their car.  It's not incredibly difficult to flip your car over.  Oh, you've done it?  You flipped your car? 
[00:02:30]  Not like, you know, 720 in midair or anything,  but I've had my car up on the side.  That rocks.  It didn't take a whole hell of a lot to get done.  Is it a weird feeling?  Dude, it's the weirdest thing you've ever seen.  Are you still in your seatbelt upside down?  Well, I wasn't completely upside down,  but I was on the...  I remember in slow motion seeing the car go onto its side,  and then I just saw the side view mirror just touch the sidewalk.  Yeah.  And then crumble into, like, dust.  And I was just like, wow, that's weird. 
[00:03:00]  That's something that you should never see happen.  Wow.  And then you just crawled out of the wreckage?  Yeah, I had to crawl out through the passenger window,  which was now above me.  Were you drunk?  No, I was not drunk.  I knew that was coming.  I have to ask you.  Were you drunk?  No, I was actually getting chased by a couple of carloads of people.  I think they were trying to beat the shit out of me for something.  Oh, nice.  I can only imagine.  Do you know why?  No, to this day I still have no idea.  But, I mean, that is a good point.  I think it's people coming home real late that flip their cars.  Not Joe Businessman, you know, trying to make it to the city for his lousy fucking job. 
[00:03:30]  Who's in a hurry for their lousy fucking job?  Yeah, it's like sometimes you, I guess if you zip around somebody and you careen off a wall.  It's funny.  I get out of a cab every morning on 6th Avenue to come in here.  And the cabs, I fucking hate them.  They stop in a lane when they don't have to.  They could actually, hi, doll.  You're in trouble.  All right.  You're in trouble.  You're in trouble.  I'm so fucking tired of it. 
[00:04:00]  You're in trouble.  Am I in trouble?  It is.  It's like school.  It's like school.  Am I in trouble?  Oh, we're talking about how shitty fucking drivers are.  I, you know, can't even fucking convey how angry I am right now.  I'm trying to be, oh, the show started.  I should be happy.  I am so pit.  Not even on my side of the road, by the way.  Not even on the westbound side. 
[00:04:30]  Are they all rubbernecking?  Rubberneckers.  But if, you know what?  If there's a car overturned, you got to rubberneck.  Uh, no.  No.  I rubber, I rubberneck my ass off.  I don't rubberneck for the fucking, uh, fender benders.  Absolutely not.  But when you see a car flipped over, how, how do you not look?  Here's when you rubberneck.  When you're on a country road, and a tractor's in front of you.  Then you rubberneck.  Mm-hmm.  Any other time, move!  Who cares?  You're not gonna see anything. 
[00:05:00]  So you could tell your little friends, you know what I saw on the way to work?  Oh my god, it was a car on its roof.  Wow!  That's pretty impressive.  That's something you don't see every day.  It doesn't matter to people.  You should look at stuff, you should stare at stuff you don't see every day.  I'm a great starer of things.  I, uh...  You're a smell the rose, stop and smell the roses guy.  Oh man.  You're a stomp on the brakes and smell the roses guy.  I'm a, I'm a, I'll stare right in your eyes and mock you type of guy. 
[00:05:30]  I mean, I'm the worst.  I am.  I'm the worst.  Move!  And by the way, you just called me more times today than you have in, I think, a total of  three years.  So I appreciate that.  Eight missed calls from Anthony, and I would guarantee...  Were you on the toity?  I would guarantee that you haven't called me eight times in three years.  Were you on the toity?  So that's pretty impressive.  I was so fucking pissed that I had to convey that I couldn't fucking move.  God, I hope you get in trouble. 
[00:06:00]  I will laugh my ass off.  I know, I know.  Believe me.  God, I hope.  And all I was thinking...  Oh, God, please.  All I was thinking is looking into Steve Blatter's face and going, yes, there was a car overturned  in front of me.  You know, I can't play this game anymore.  Steve, there was no accident.  Ant just told me he needed, you know, some time to...  I did need some time, Steve.  He didn't wake up late.  There was just a hot new rest area on the LIE, and Anthony got a brand new fucking wireless  drill. 
[00:06:30]  That was a nice two-inch hole saw.  It's beautiful.  Cuts like butter.  You went to the grand opening of the new rest area?  Yeah.  Oh, and I felt...  When I called you up, I told you, I felt like I was going to school, and I was going to get  in trouble.  Oh, that's all I felt like, was like, I'm going to be in trouble.  Ugh!  I'm an adult!  I'm going to work.  Should we call Blatter to make sure you're not in trouble, or... 
[00:07:00]  I think we probably should.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you can calm down?  Give him a call and say, uh...  What was Jimmy saying about cabs?  Just that, uh, they...  We're talking about bad driving.  Whenever I get out at 6th Avenue, they fucking stop.  Like, there's not...  People park, so they can pull over to the curb, but they stop in a lane.  Oh, motherfucking cabs like that!  You're right, you're right.  They're the worst.  Well, well, especially this time of the morning, because they're all looking for a fare.  No!  Sorry!  Way home, too.  At about 11 o'clock in the morning, when I'm driving home...  Where they jam on the brakes in front of you? 
[00:07:30]  No, not even jam on the brakes.  And almost cause a major accident?  I would love that, because you know what?  At least that would be a little exhilarating.  How about you stopped at a fucking light, there's a cab in front of you.  It's red.  It's been red for a while.  It turns green, and the door opens.  And now, either the cab's an asshole, or the motherfucker in there is an asshole for deciding when the light turns green, he's gonna now get out.  And slowly pay the guy, one, two, three, and I'm sitting behind, looking at a green light, deteriorating! 
[00:08:00]  Well, you gotta make sure there's not an extra one in there.  You gotta.  You don't wanna waste a one.  It's infuriating!  And they will not pull over to the side of the road anymore.  A cab used to pull over to the curb.  Hi!  Curbside service!  Not anymore!  Middle of the fucking road, dead stop, fuck anyone behind ya!  And that's when I start yelling, savage! 
[00:08:30]  I yell, hey, savage!  Move!  Well, this is not even, this was not in the middle lane.  This was in, like, the far left lane, but not the curb.  Like, so what's happening is I'm getting out, and I'm gonna be rear-ended and paralyzed.  Oh!  It's like, I see UPS trucks coming, and you see them barreling down on you, and I'm like, will you hurry up, you fucking chimp?  Tear off the receipt!  Fucking, or pull over!  It's infuriating!  Yeah, it makes me angry as a driver, and when I'm getting out of a cab. 
[00:09:00]  Yes!  But you guys are weird that you don't rubberneck.  That's strange, man.  No!  I will not rub...  I'll look, but not slow down.  I rubberneck, I fucking take out my BlackBerry for pictures, I take out my HD Flip, whatever I can get done in that ten seconds of passing the record.  It better be Area 51.  Right.  That's the only place I'd rubberneck.  Nah, you gotta look around a little bit, man.  Other than that, I'm not fucking looking, I'm driving, and I'm on that horn like a motherfucker the second I see a brake light. 
[00:09:30]  What if a...  Bam!  What if a 17-year-old girl is getting, you know, banged on the hood of a car on the side of the road?  Are you looking then?  My car is probably parked on the side.  There you go.  And she...  There you go.  Point me.  Point me.  Point me.  Did Steve call Platter?  Thank you.  Platter says Ant's not in trouble, he's fine.  Oh, I was expecting a meeting.  What's wrong with a meeting?  Did Steve rat me out?  They're exciting. 
[00:10:00]  Yesterday's meeting, by the way?  No, I was just...  I think it was Steve starts to come in and he's like, no, no, no, it wasn't that.  I was just trying to...  Shut up.  I needed to contribute to the program.  Would you like this A&E special?  It's truckers with mommets.  It's a good special.  No.  He did give me the Black Sabbath special, so thank you, Steve.  Yes, yes.  One out of a hundred isn't bad.  Jimmy, I believe, was my pal Anthony.  I told you about that.  You're right.  One out of a hundred isn't bad.  One out of a hundred. 
[00:10:30]  Yesterday's meeting, by the way...  Jim Norton was very productive.  Almost caused my death.  That's Anthony Koumiou.  Yes.  Not the meeting itself.  It was very productive.  That's all on the way home.  When I sit in a meeting, it is like narcolepsy for me.  I can't sit in an office with superiors without having this feeling of impending sleep.  It just happens.  And I'm driving home, and I finally get home and realize I don't remember the drive. 
[00:11:00]  At all.  That's good.  It's frightening.  You should get a driver.  You think?  Yes.  I do, yeah.  I really should probably do that, but it's so pompous.  It's not pompous.  Isn't it?  Get Bitterman.  Bitterman.  Take me through the park, Bitterman.  You know I love the park.  I don't know.  Drive...  I always feel like if something happens, I need to stop somewhere or something on the 
[00:11:30]  way home.  It's going to be a problem.  I'd rather drive myself, because I know I'll do a hundred miles an hour if I want to get  home early.  It's one of those...  You'll do some things that a driver wouldn't do.  Right.  I can't see the driver.  I will not get up on the sidewalk, Mr. Cumia.  I will not go the wrong way on the one-way street.  There is a police officer I must adhere to the speed limit.  I will not pass him at 85 miles per hour.  True.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, you're here.  Everything's okay.  Oh, my God. 
[00:12:00]  Let me go to Rape Kit, because one of our guys is in the news today.  Well, I shouldn't say one of our guys.  He's his own guy, but he does our show a lot.  Rape Kit, what's going on?  Rape Kit.  Good morning, boy.  Good morning, Rape Kit.  What do you got?  Well, I mean, it's kind of a free speech issue, and I think that it's important...  Shut up!  Does he get it?  Free speech.  Shut up!  Blow me!  Blow me!  But if it's kind of a free speech issue, and I think you guys should definitely take up  the cause, because it involves Louis C.K., and that's one of your friends. 
[00:12:30]  Louis got, I think, a radio show kicked off the air, right?  Are you kidding?  Well, no, here's what happened exactly.  The show Fresh...  I don't listen to NPR at all.  Fresh Air or something?  Yeah.  NPR.  I've been on NPR for over 30 years, and Louis C.K. was one of the guests on it back July  7th.  Basically, he had a conversation, and it wasn't even the entire interview.  It was just part of the conversation.  They were talking about Louis C.K. being ashamed of his body, and he's very self-deprecating. 
[00:13:00]  He talked about how he likes to wear a shirt.  Well, he should be.  Yeah.  He likes to wear a shirt when he has sex, and he hasn't put on...  He hasn't taken off his shirt since he was 23 years old.  And he was making a serious comment about that.  It never got more lewd than that, more descriptive.  That was it.  And he also talked about...  Just that he never took his shirt off since he was 27?  No, I heard that...  23 while he was fucking...  Oh, 23.  As he shouldn't have, yeah.  But I heard that as well.  It wasn't graphic.  That's what he said.  He said, when I have sex, I keep my shirt on. 
[00:13:30]  That was basically it.  And this...  He said he should be the victim in sex, I think.  I should be the one being victimized.  I would hate to have a knee looming over me.  But it wasn't...  It was very, very mild just making fun of himself.  Well, NPR...  Fuck NPR.  Mississippi NPR happened to share offices in Mississippi alone only with public universities and colleges.  So what happened is they said the caller that was on...  The caller was on hold that was on hold at the public college. 
[00:14:00]  And that's what they broadcast over the air.  And she heard that on hold, which had nothing to do with the radio show, except the fact that that's what the public broadcasting...  And she...  The person...  I don't know if it was a she...  That was really a sexist remark.  We're just saying it.  It probably was.  But that person complained.  How does one person have so much power, by the way?  How is it sexist a misogynist to make fun of himself?  No, no, no.  I was saying it's sexist of me to think that it was probably...  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It was on hold.  But you know what? 
[00:14:30]  Whatever the case may be, the person got Louis C.K.  You know, they got upset.  And they got Terry Gross' show kicked off the air.  Wait.  Who kicked Terry Gross?  Was it NPR that kicked the show off the air?  I'm sure NPR did it.  Then it was NPR, not the person.  That's interrupting, dude.  I'll never understand that.  The person complained because they were offended.  So one last...  Hold on, hold on.  We get what you're saying.  Let's jump right in here.  So one person complained, what Louis C.K. said on Fresh Air on NPR.  So now the show is off the air because NPR decided to listen to one dummy. 
[00:15:00]  I fucking hate NPR, by the way.  I despise NPR.  Hold on, dude.  Most overrated fucking...  Most overrated radio in history is NPR.  The most overrated fucking radio ever.  Jim, I disagree with you.  I'm not supporting necessarily NPR's call.  I know you are.  Why are you listening?  I'm not saying you are, dude.  I'm just...  I'm teasing you.  You're panicking, dude.  Oh my God, he's freaking out.  Great, kid.  You're having a panic attack. 
[00:15:30]  I'm just saying...  I'm not attacking you.  I'm saying I've always hated NPR.  I am.  I've always fucking hated the lack of noise.  I don't need bells and whistles.  But how about a sound?  Well, how about some emotion in the voice, too?  It's monitor radio.  It's completely true.  But you know, you've also got other friends of yours that like to do that shit, like,  for big Leo.  President Obama addressed the oil companies today.  Honestly, it's a cure for insomnia. 
[00:16:00]  Well, Louis C.K. put up a video about it.  We heard it the first time.  It bombed.  What'd he say?  Insomnia.  What'd you say, dude?  What'd you say?  Jimmy didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it.  It was...  It was...  You did.  You did already.  This time I actually didn't hear it.  It's on Louis C.K.'s Twitter, though.  This time...  This is the one time I actually didn't hear it.  He said twice it's a cure for insomnia.  I heard him.  Now, listen.  Just so we have the facts straight, it was local public radio in Mississippi. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, it was?  Which is basically a rip-off of NPR.  NPR still sucks.  They do the NPR thing, but they're doing it, like, kind of locally, if that makes sense,  so...  Well, fuck them and fuck NPR.  Yeah.  I still fucking don't like NPR, so...  I don't like their contents.  I wanted to say, thanks for taking my call, but you should seriously...  Right.  Endless.  You're taking my call.  Hey, how much...  You press a button.  What is this?  You do.  It's an endless conversation.  Rape Kit really is fucking falling apart. 
[00:17:00]  And Rape Kit...  It's just...  You're talking like someone being dragged out of court.  It's been a fun night, Jimmy.  All right, buddy.  And Rape Kit, change your name.  You're too intelligent for a fucking name like Rape Kit.  No, he's not.  I was going to say, call it Rape Kit Dummy.  Add to it.  Change your fucking name.  His first name is Ray, and his last name is Kit.  Right.  He's an odd...  He's an odd Eastern European.  I was expecting a duty phone call if you're called Rape Kit. 
[00:17:30]  Change your fucking name if you've got a little intelligence to you.  I said a little.  I'll put a little consideration into it there.  All right.  Get the fucking...  No, no.  Go.  Oh, my God.  Enough already.  He's ready to ramble on again.  Anything starts that guy off.  All right.  Take care.  You know, care is very important.  We got it.  We understand.  We understand.  Here's the deal.  We're trying to get Louis C.K. on the phone, but he's on the West Coast, and I think he  made a video about the whole thing if you want to go further into Rape Kit's phone call  there.  Louis is great about making videos.  Oh, yeah.  He is.  Oh, my God.  Anything that happens, that man will make a video about it. 
[00:18:00]  I know.  Jesus.  I think it's Louis C.K. on Twitter.  I'm sure there's a link to his video if you want to check it out.  I'm trying the West Coast, sinking his giant dick into somebody.  You think he's got a big wish?  I know he does.  Squish.  But we saw it on the show.  I know.  I lie.  His dick is horrible.  His little Irish red dick, even though he's Mexican.  Louis is the only guy.  They didn't even have to fucking change it for TV syndication when they shot his dick.  No pixelation, nothing.  No.  It's small enough.  No one will be offended.  How long is it?  It's 13 minutes.  Louis is rambling on about this, isn't he? 
[00:18:30]  Louis is a panic.  His fucking dark spots under his eyes.  You know what?  I don't know.  It's Louis Rape Kit C.K.  If we need filler, we'll play that 13-minute clip.  I'm sure it would be a great clip to play, but 13 minutes is a little rough right now.  Stop.  Hey, you know what?  It leads into this.  I was reading the paper today, and just a little dumb thing in the sports column caught my interest.  And it has something to do with it.  Is George dead still?  Well, fuck.  Well, there's a couple things going on. 
[00:19:00]  George Steinbrenner.  These fucking Yankees.  Your fucking team sucks a big, fat dick, and I'll tell you why.  All right.  And the papers are reporting on it.  You know why the Yankees suck?  Why?  Because they knew the phone was flawed but released it anyway?  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  Wrong shitty company.  Oh, well, we'll get into the Apple thing, too.  So Bob Shepard dies.  He's 99 years old.  He's been calling Yankee games since what year?  Like, 94?  Oh.  He announced for fucking DiMaggio.  1950-something. 
[00:19:30]  Was it 50-something?  51?  52?  Maybe, yeah.  Something like that.  Joe DiMaggio.  Safe to say, 50 years, he was the Yankees' PA announcer, right, when you go to the games?  So he dies at 99, just short of 100.  How did it happen?  And they had his wake out there on Long Island, in Baldwin, I believe.  Yes.  Not one fucking Yankee went.  Are you shitting me?  Not one fucking Yankee went.  I don't know if the current Yankees are on the road, so that would make it rough, obviously. 
[00:20:00]  No, they're playing in New York tonight.  Oh, it makes it even worse.  Not one fucking Yankee said, you know what, I'm going to do the right thing and give my  respects.  It's right there in Baldwin.  It's an easy drive.  Derek Jeter?  Not one fucking Yankee.  And the sports pages are all over it, man.  Wow.  Not a current Yankee, not a former Yankee, not one fucking guy went to this guy's memorial.  Maybe Bob Shepard was a twat.  Maybe they hated him.  Maybe he was just a great announcer but a horrible person.  And they didn't want to be involved. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Maybe they hated him.  Not one fucking guy.  You know something?  It's not even all that fucking far.  Oh, here it is.  For 57 years, he announced them at Yankee Stadium.  Why didn't one player go to his funeral?  Look.  Wow.  Sounds of silence.  Shepard laid to rest, but not one Yankee player attends funeral.  That is horse shit.  That's terrible.  One guy should be stepping up and going, you know what, I'm representing the current Yankees.  Represent the team.  Or something.  Especially Jeter.  Jeter. 
[00:21:00]  Because he talks about honoring Bob Shepard by continuing to play, you know,  Right.  To use his intro.  Yeah, he's like, I'm going to honor him until I'm not a Yankee anymore.  And you can't go to the guy's funeral.  Wow.  Where were they last night?  They're probably in New York.  They're playing here tonight.  The All-Star game was three days ago.  Guaranteed there's an excuse.  Wait a minute.  And you know what?  There was an All-Star break, which makes it even easier to do it.  Is it because they're going to say they might be doing a tribute to him at the stadium?  No, they're doing a tribute to Steinbrenner tonight.  You know what?  It doesn't matter if they do a tribute at the stadium. 
[00:21:30]  Either way, Cashman went.  You have a few days off.  They're finally, this is the first game after the All-Star break, I guess, right?  Tonight?  Tonight's the Yankees.  Oh, it makes it even worse.  You know what I would say?  They had free fucking time, man.  You know what I would say?  L-I-E!  The expressway sucks.  There's traffic.  You want to talk about rubbernecking, man?  That would have been a hell of a rubberneck.  Bob Shepard fucking dead in a coffin?  You want to see Jeter going by?  I'm thinking rubbernecking from the players.  They don't want to sit there in traffic. 
[00:22:00]  Looking at some fucking Yenta on the goddamn L.I.E.?  How about Greg Nettles gets his ass off the fucking couch and goes?  What does he have to do?  Oh, what a third baseman.  What is Mickey Rivers doing the last few days?  Prison?  Probably.  No, I don't even know.  I don't know nothing about Mickey Rivers.  I don't know.  But anyway, so that's a biggie today.  Biggie.  Wow.  Guy was the announcer for 57 years.  Not one fucking guy stepped up for him.  You know what, though?  Not one.  I bet the press won't even ask him about it, so we'll never know. 
[00:22:30]  Oof.  They are going to hammer the players about that one.  The family's not happy.  They're like, what the fuck?  Oh, the family's bothered, too, huh?  Everyone's bothered.  Like, this guy gave his heart and soul to the fucking organization.  Yes.  Supposedly he worked when he was sick.  He didn't miss a day, I think.  Never missed a day or some shit like that.  He was still doing his job at, like, 96 or something.  Yeah.  He just retired.  Fucking...  Relatively speaking.  He stayed until 2007.  I agree with Jimmy more and more that athletes in general just suck. 
[00:23:00]  Most of them are the...  Just suck.  Believe me, I'm not just pushing for Dana's guys, either.  The UFC guys are the guys that were the fan-friendliest.  They'll be pricks soon.  I hope not, man.  Most athletes I've met have been fucking cocksuckers.  And, like you've said in the past, it's that jock mentality...  Fucking hate me.  ...that never goes away.  That you remember from school, you remember from fucking if you went to college.  It's that jock, I'm better than you mentality that never goes away. 
[00:23:30]  They couldn't get a couple scrubs over there?  Nothing?  Something.  The Yankee organization should have got together and said, wow, we gotta represent this thing.  Jabba Chamberlain.  Somebody.  Send Jabba over.  Somebody.  Ugh.  Jabba.  My fucking cousin should have went.  Right, exactly.  He's not pitching.  Yeah.  It's weird.  They don't have...  They don't mention this in the post.  I mean, they're saying that he's dead and that there's...  But they're showing Cashman.  They're making it look like a lot of people came. 
[00:24:00]  Now lying on a satin pillow.  Mom's seven.  Me.  Unbelievable.  But anyway, I saw that in the sports section, but I also saw this.  I'm a big golf fan.  British Open is happening right now, right?  Ah, golf.  So I was reading all the British Open articles this morning, and this was very interesting.  Quit racial quibs or drop double standard. 
[00:24:30]  What?  Something we talk about a lot.  Who's that?  It's in the paper I don't mention, because they're a bunch of fucking cocksuckers.  Wait a minute.  I don't want to talk anything about race today, because I heard from a few listeners that race,  and I quote from Twitter,  is not a big issue these days.  Anthony, it's not the 50s.  Why don't you lay off race?  Anyway, continue.  Wow.  Yeah, exactly.  Yesterday from St. Andrews, here we go, ESPN host Mike Tirico threw it to Rocco Mediate, 
[00:25:00]  who used to play.  And now he's like a play-by-play guy, okay?  So Rocco is one of the guys.  He's working for ESPN and covering the next shot from Italy's Edorado Molinari,  obviously an Italian golfer, okay?  Yeah.  So Rocco Mediate, kidding among the analysts, began about how it's good to have a Rocco  covering the Italian boy.  All right, so the other guys go, it's good that Rocco's covering the Italian boy, okay? 
[00:25:30]  It's right about pasta time, 7.15 p.m. in Scotland, added Tirico.  Okay, all in good fun.  So they made a pasta joke, right?  Yeah.  Okay, all in good fun, no offense intended, and hopefully none taken,  but what if there had been an African-American assigned to the next shot by a black player  or a Mexican-American analyst covering a Mexican player or a Chinese-American covering a Chinese  player?  And the same as associative cultural cracks were spoken.  I'll answer it. 
[00:26:00]  Italians can take a fucking joke.  Well, listen, and then it's quoted by this, by saying this, hey, it must be fried chicken time.  Imagine if that was said.  Yep.  It wasn't when Tiger got up?  Or it must be time for burritos.  Imagine if that was said.  Or those guys make me want shrimp and lobster sauce, okay?  Hell would boil up and over.  Or the network would apologize, release statements, careers would be stained or ruined.  Yep.  It either has to work one way all the time or the other way all the time.  It can't keep working two different ways and pretend to serve equality. 
[00:26:30]  Why are they just saying?  We've been saying that for fucking years.  Because we're ahead of everybody.  Why are they just saying that?  We know that by now.  Just figuring that out.  So you can still make the Italian jokes, but you can't make the black jokes, you can't  make the Asian jokes, and we learned you can't really make the Mexican jokes anymore  because the dude, what was it, NASCAR guy got in trouble?  Yeah.  By the way, this fucking, whoever wrote that, great article, but how about instead of writing  a proactive thing about the Italians, how about they write an attack the next time it 
[00:27:00]  happens where someone bothers making a black joke, how about they fucking take the riskier  route in the media and go after whoever fucking gets in trouble, like whoever gets them  in trouble for making a black joke or a Mexican joke?  Yeah.  How about you step up and defend?  They'll never defend that.  Right.  I'm glad they wrote that.  Step up and defend.  Man, you're right.  How about some real balls?  I don't even know who wrote this because it doesn't have a name.  I'm speaking for all Italians, by the way.  They don't care.  We have a great sense of humor and things like, you know, of course, the organized crime thing 
[00:27:30]  when you watch movies, Goodfellas, Godfather, Sopranos.  Right.  We don't mind the tie-in to organized crime except for one or two of these Italian groups  that want to speak for everybody.  For the most part, who gives a shit?  Someone wants to call you a guinea, a wop, make fun of a fucking pasta day or whatever.  Who cares?  We don't care.  We hold the entire sanitation and cement fucking business.  Imagine if Tiger Woods was about to hit a shot and they made a fried chicken joke. 
[00:28:00]  Holy.  People would be, they would yank him off the air before the guy got the line out.  Make a Perkins waitress joke.  Well, that would be wonderful.  That would be wonderful.  So, that was pretty interesting paper today.  I'm, right now I'm saying this.  British Petroleum, long and strong.  Thank you, my friends.  Did you make some money off that disaster?  Dude, I am laughing when I see a duck coated in oil. 
[00:28:30]  I laugh all the way to the bank.  When I see a pelican with little oil bubbles coming out of his little bill holes that they  call nostrils, I go, money for me.  Did you make money off it?  Of course I did.  I sold my Apple stock right when this whole shit went through.  I told you Apple sucks.  I've been telling you guys for years Apple sucks.  No signal.  Well, it's about time the world's going to find out.  You know what, Tom?  Press conference today, right?  I have no problem with mine.  Is your phone fucking up like they're saying, Jimmy? 
[00:29:00]  Well, I'm using an older case, which is not made for this phone because of the way it  holds it in my pocket.  But it has when I've held the antenna.  But thank God, I've got to say this in favor of Apple.  Oh.  Steve Jobs knew there was a design flaw.  But he liked the way it looked!  I've read that, too.  Is that...  Yes, it's true.  Could that possibly be true?  Of course it is.  That sounds insane.  The phone came out.  What?  I have no fucking padding on my phone. 
[00:29:30]  I have no bumper, as they call it.  Well, can we explain to everybody what's the deal?  I have no problem.  If you don't have a cover, you're...  Holding the phone a certain way.  Right.  Your hand is way wrapped around the antenna.  If you're touching...  Oh, I hold it in my ass, though.  All right.  Well, yes.  That's different.  Okay.  And that's not even your ass.  That's just the cocks that are in there protecting the phone.  Dick in the butt joke.  That was horrible.  Of course.  So, if you hold it a certain way, like I'm holding it now, with the part of your palm and  your fingers around the outside of it, the claw will drop. 
[00:30:00]  Mm-hmm.  So, the solution, thank God, at least Apple...  Well, how are you supposed to hold the phone so that doesn't happen in your teeth?  Well, apparently in your teeth, or you're supposed to levitate it.  You're always supposed to use it in space, where you don't hold it.  Space.  And they knew it, and they fucking released, because he was warned that it could cause  drop calls.  So, at least they did, is they had these little bumpers designed that go around.  So, at least Apple said, fuck it.  We'll do the right thing and charge people $30.  Here's the conspiracy theory, too.  It's the first time...  They can everyone fucking buy their cases now.  The first time Apple's ever put out a bumper themselves, it wasn't third party. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  They put out their own bumper for the phone.  Right.  And they knew that there was...  Is there a bumper case, basically?  It's a little rim that goes around the outside edge and protects the antenna, and protects  the phone also from dropping it and shit.  And they sold it day of phone.  Day of phone was being sold.  So, they knew there was a problem, and they sold a solution to it for the first time ever  under the guise that it protects the phone.  And they also fucking...  There was an internal memo leaked.  Where they were going, hey, we're not... 
[00:31:00]  Hey, look at the skinny fuck giving the press conference.  He needs a liver.  Yeah.  Apple's too controlling.  I can't be part of their world.  They said we're not giving out the bumpers for free.  Had they given out these bumpers for free, I would have had a little more respect for  them.  Right, yeah.  The internal memo was leaked.  If their phones have a problem, then they've got to offer the solution for free.  I still love the products, but this is just...  I hate Steve Jobs.  I hate him.  It's pretty much a recall.  When you have something wrong with your car, you bring it in, they fix it for fucking 
[00:31:30]  free, right?  Here's what they're going to do.  They're never going to recall it.  It's going to be a giant class action suit, by the way.  Giant class action suit against them.  The people that bought the phone are going to get like, you know, eight bucks a piece  back.  How, though?  How do you not get your money back?  They're going to probably offer refunds.  Here's what they're going to do.  They're going to offer refunds if you want one.  Or some sort of refund or store credit.  And next generation phone that you're going to have to buy will be differently designed.  It's just the way they fucking operate.  They said it's humiliating if they have to do a full recall. 
[00:32:00]  But the class action suit's already against AT&T.  And again, I really have a love-hate relationship because Apple puts out the best stuff.  All right, Windows fan boy.  They do.  I'm all in with Mac.  All in.  But these motherfuckers.  Steve Jobs, I have a fucking hatred for because he's arrogant, man.  I like my Mac Pro, but I just will not jump in with the iPhone.  I refuse to do it.  It's a work of art, but they went with a terrible carrier. 
[00:32:30]  My phone is looking very dated, and I'm not even going to step up and get an iPhone.  Dude, I'd rather talk on a fucking, I'd rather fucking have a carrier pigeon on a Blackberry.  I've had no problems with mine.  I can't agree with that point.  And I've taken a couple of calls with it, but for the most part, I don't use it as a phone.  So you've got to kind of use the, what percentage of time do you use your iPhone?  17.5 on weekdays before 4.  All right, Jimmy, but I calculated you different at 17.3.  Well, fucking Apple, man. 
[00:33:00]  They should step up and do the right thing.  What the fuck?  What's the right thing at this point, though?  I'll tell you the right thing.  The right thing is to fucking hand these things out to fix their problem.  Here's the right thing.  It's not your problem.  It's their problem.  Here's the right thing.  So why do you have to spend another 30 bucks to fix their problem?  A hundred percent.  That's right.  Here's the right thing.  They either, A, offer free bumpers with the phones.  B, they offer you a refund if you want one or a tremendous incentive towards the next  phone.  Or they offer a refund to everybody who paid for the fucking bumper and an incentive towards 
[00:33:30]  the next phone.  When's this press conference?  Today.  At what time?  I don't know, but I think...  Today!  I got to check out this press conference.  It's fucking despicable.  That's embarrassing.  And really, he said that he knew that there was a flaw, but he liked the design?  Well, some internal designer said that.  I guess it came out.  But Consumer Reports killed it.  And that's bad.  Early on, too.  When Consumer Reports killed it, it's bad.  And I guess they can't stop the fucking onslaught.  Sure. 
[00:34:00]  And I love the iPhone.  I love this version more than I've ever loved one.  But I had to buy something to help the reception in my apartment.  Here's the thing, too.  I don't think anybody owns an iPhone that doesn't know the problem.  See this little gap right here?  See that little line?  If you put your finger over this...  Well, I want to do that.  You're going to have a problem.  Well, I got to do that.  It really is a bad design.  Yes, I got to do that.  You would feel compelled to do that?  Yes, of course I would.  You'd do that every time and just go, fuck!  Yes.  But you should be able to.  Stop defending your iPhone.  They don't pay you. 
[00:34:30]  I'm not defending it, but I'm...  Do the right thing and beat the shit out of this company for what they're doing.  I'm saying, until there is a solution, I just don't bridge this gap with my fucking finger.  I'll sit there and talk like this.  Hi!  And if you're listening on the radio, I'm now holding my phone to my headphones.  You'd almost think he was on it if you didn't know better.  I'm an idiot.  You've praised the iPhone.  You've got to beat them up when they do wrong by the people.  Why they...  You have to.  That's ridiculous. 
[00:35:00]  It is a dumb design, but it's one of those designs like, let's say your steering wheel  on your car had a gap in it right at the top, and if you touched it, it would instantly  roll off to the right and go into a tree.  I would have to touch it.  Would you ever touch that gap?  Yes, I would have to.  Why?  I don't know.  Why do I pick scabs for two straight years?  I don't know.  But you know.  Don't do that.  I know if I pick the scab, it's going to fucking take forever to heal, but I continue fucking 
[00:35:30]  picking it.  But don't do it.  I have to.  I don't know why, but I have to.  Probably because I was yelled at as a kid.  I don't know.  Hey, Fuzzy Zeller made the fried chicken comment.  That's right.  Oh, Fuzzy Zeller.  Yeah, he did.  Was it Fuzzy, or someone else was saying it was the other dude?  No, I think it was Fuzzy.  Travis, you know a little bit about golf.  Was it Fuzzy Zeller that did the fried chicken?  Travis, by the way, is the guy in the booth.  That's why I was introducing Anthony and you before, because we were told yesterday, and  Steve Blatter made actually a good point.  There's a lot of people sometimes, who's once in a while, just let people know who's talking, 
[00:36:00]  Jim Norton, because if you're just tuning in and you're not that familiar with the  show, it's like you hear five voices, six voices.  So we're going to copy.  Anthony Cumia here.  Hi, Ed.  I agree, too, when I heard him say that, Anthony speaking, that we should identify everybody  that's talking, Anthony.  Jim Norton agrees.  I'm talking now, and I'm the genius.  Greg Opie Hughes.  I'm just the genius.  Huh?  That's how I want to be.  I'm a genius.  But people will be confused. 
[00:36:30]  That's okay.  It doesn't matter.  Opie looks really tired and loopy.  Like, this is a conversation he's had in the mirror.  Don't listen to them.  You're a genius.  Dry shaving, like fucking Rambo.  I dry shave.  You don't dry shave.  With a fucking Rambo knife.  You ever dry shave with a fucking dull razor, and you still fucking continue to dry shave?  I'm an electric guy.  Oh, it's terrific.  Was it Fuzzy Zeller there, Travis?  That made the Tiger Woods comment?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was Fuzzy.  With the fried chicken thing?  Yeah.  At the Masters, and he almost got kicked off TV for that, right? 
[00:37:00]  He was being presented with the green jacket at the time, I believe, and Fuzzy made a fried  chicken joke.  Yeah, he told him not to order the fried chicken or collard greens.  See, he's making a colored joke.  But that's just as good as the pasta joke, right?  So the guy in the paper makes a good point, whoever he was.  And another thing to add to the Bob Shepard thing, where not one current or former Yankee  went to his funeral or wake, whatever.  Ken's got some more info on this. 
[00:37:30]  Ken.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hi, Ken.  I hope you mentioned Nettles.  Yeah, this is Ken speaking.  You've mentioned Nettles.  Are you a caller to the show?  We just want to make sure people know exactly who you are.  Yeah, people might think it's a staff member.  Yeah, I'm calling from New Jersey just to make everything, you know, exact.  Okay.  Old-timers day is on Saturday in New York.  So there's ex-Yankees and former Yankees going to be attending.  So there's no reason why none of them showed up to Bob Shepard's wake. 
[00:38:00]  So it gets even worse, Anthony.  Not only did they have an all-star break, so the Yankees that weren't playing in the  game were just kind of hanging around for a few days.  Then you got the old-timers in town hanging around waiting for this fucking...  How about you drop him?  ...this fucking old-timers game that's happening over the weekend.  Who wants to go to the ball?  Wow.  Maybe none of them knew personally about Bob, but he probably didn't interact with any of  them.  He was just a voice.  They're like, all right, fuck it, he's dead.  They've heard his voice thousands of times in their career at Yankee Stadium.  I bet if Steinbrenner didn't die, there would have been Yankees there. 
[00:38:30]  I think Steinbrenner overshadowed the entire fucking thing.  Clusterfucked his funeral.  One guy.  I'm not talking about, like...  Oh, believe me, I know.  Joe Pepitone should have been there at least.  Or somebody.  Somebody that has nothing else to do.  Not one guy.  That's the point they're making in the paper.  That is fucking embarrassing.  If you have one or two, then you could go, well, he was there to represent the old-times.  He was there to represent the current Yankees.  We covered our bases.  Not one fucking guy.  It is embarrassing. 
[00:39:00]  All right.  Hey, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I'm right here.  Hey, you mentioned the iPhone and Consumer Reports.  Yes.  I was looking at something yesterday that they actually fixed that by putting duct tape over  the antenna.  Oh, that's a good solution.  Duct tape is the king of fixing everything.  And also, clear nail polish will work, and it doesn't change the look of the phone, and  they can't fuck you for 30 bucks.  It just sickens me that the way that jobs refuse to fucking just give that out to people 
[00:39:30]  and go, look.  It really makes me angry.  I spin my phone on a stick, like the old Ed Sullivan show, the guy with the plates,  and I talk into it that way.  I do it like a globetrotter.  I spin it on my pinky, and I whistle sweet Georgia Brown while I have my dick sucked.  So there is going to be a class action fucking lawsuit.  There has to be.  Because the guy isn't fucking handing these things out for free.  I want the turtleneck.  I'm going to sue him for the turtleneck and his liver.  His stupid liver. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, that thing's done.  Oh, it's awful.  He works like the antenna on the phone.  He touches his side the wrong way, and he shits fucking blood.  Isn't it the pancreas, though, with him?  Oh, who knows?  He's one of the rare guys that comes back from the pancreatic cancer?  Really?  Did he have that?  That's what I thought.  Wow.  I thought it was his liver.  I thought it was the pancreas, and he's one of the rare guys that was able to survive that shit.  Wow.  I don't know.  Thin as a pin, Magoo.  Oh, fuck.  John in Pittsburgh, what?  What, John?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What, John? 
[00:40:30]  John in Pittsburgh.  You can't speak what?  Oh, that's the, uh, your pronunciation of Mike Perico.  Yeah.  And Eduardi Molinara, or Maranara, what did you say?  I don't know.  What's your point, John?  It's Eduardo Molinari and Mike Perico.  Oh!  Wow!  All right, John.  Thank you.  I just wanted to take a little...  Thank God you called in to straighten that out. 
[00:41:00]  I appreciate it, John.  Thank you.  Anything else?  You guys are fabulous.  Thanks.  All right, John.  I didn't know that, though.  Love you.  I'll see you.  Bye.  I realized, uh, it was too early to start reading, to be honest with you.  Too early?  Oh, man.  Still had crusties in your eyes?  I panicked when I realized, fuck, I gotta read at 6.15.  Why am I reading?  I could barely read at 9.15.  6.15.  Oh, it was a liver transplant?  But what the fuck was the pancreas all about?  Was that a rumor? 
[00:41:30]  With the cancerous tumor's pancreas, the prognosis for pancreas is usually very grim.  Jobs, however, stated that he had a rare, far less aggressive type known as islet cell neuroendocrine tumor.  Uh, John, call back from Pittsburgh.  I don't think I ain't got that one right.  I think I nailed it.  Do you?  Yeah.  Neuroendocrine.  I don't know.  I might have gotten an inslet cell neuroendocrine tumor.  I don't know.  I'll call in and say, yes, it was proper pronunciation. 
[00:42:00]  So it was the pancreas.  Where is the pancreas?  It, uh, resides very close to the liver, yeah.  Because I had it, uh, checked out for my acid reflux.  All that came back nice for me.  My gallbladder came back nice for me.  All that shit's on your right side.  Yeah.  And then they just left the left side alone.  You know, most of your organs, if you have a little problem with it, they can fix it.  That pancreas, though?  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, they can't figure that shit out, can they?  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  That is a... 
[00:42:30]  I lost someone in my family recently to the pancreas, fucking, the pancreatic cancer.  Really?  One of the nicest, fucking funniest guys in my family.  Not blood-related.  That's why he was so fucking funny.  I had an ant.  Ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum.  I had an ant go from that.  Really?  Ah, dude, seconds.  Yeah, this guy was...  She's like, I have pancreatic...  And the fucking floor was over, Johnny.  Yeah, fuck.  That's a nasty one.  That's the one you don't want the doc telling you.  This guy, he was a great guy. 
[00:43:00]  He was the one I always fucking went to at family functions, because the rest of my family...  Dumb senses of humor and stuff, but this guy...  Give or take.  This guy had a great sense of humor, and he fucking...  Yeah, he passed a couple months ago.  Great guy.  Oh, a couple of months?  What?  A couple of months ago?  Oh, no.  Yeah, well, he died a couple months ago.  How long did he have it?  I don't know.  All of a sudden, I was at a wedding, and I went, what the fuck?  You know, he'd lost a lot of weight and stuff.  Yeah.  And then he survived another year, I think. 
[00:43:30]  It's a cancer diet.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Eh, whatever.  Pounds melt off you.  It's a drag.  He was a great guy.  Anyway.  I know, I know.  I'm looking at this fucking...  By the way, I'm looking at this ship.  They found it at the World Trade Center site.  Yes!  They extended Lower Manhattan many, many, many, many, many years ago.  You should have had it three more.  Yeah, in the 1800s, 1900s, whatever.  Early 1900s.  Whenever they did it.  So it covered up...  I guess they made a landfill, and the Trade Center were kind of built on that. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  And they just found, while, I guess, digging deep,  an old 18th century vessel here in New York at Ground Zero.  And they're trying to preserve it.  But who gives a shit?  You know what?  Fuck that fucking ship.  Everything old doesn't have to be saved.  Isn't that amazing, how we feel about old stuff?  It's not...  If it was 15th century, that goes...  But if it's 18th century, who gives a fuck?  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  If it was underwater, it couldn't have been any good.  What are you going to do, dig it up and look at it?  Hey, this was once a ship.  But now, you know...  You know what?  I was ready to get mad at you, but I think you make a really good point.  Because then I was thinking...  Let's fast forward 100 years, and all of a sudden they find your shitty Saturn buried somewhere.  Are they going to save it?  Exactly.  Are they going to wonder whose blonde wig hairs are in it?  Are they going to save all that shit?  Hi, Johnny.  You just...  What makes this important?  Maybe it was a shitty ship.  Watch Indiana Jones. 
[00:45:00]  Watch the first fucking Raiders.  And when Belloc talks about the watch being buried, he goes, look at this watch.  You buy it in a store for nothing.  You bury it.  A couple thousand years goes by.  You dig it up.  It's a fortune.  People just fucking think that way.  They think it's fucking priceless when you dig up something old that's just been hidden away for a couple hundred years.  They should have seen this.  A couple hundred years.  And they should have went, let's get some more dirt in here.  This piece of shit fucking ship is fucking poking up. 
[00:45:30]  This piece of ship ship.  Hey, this busted up ship is fucking poking through the ground.  It's bugging me.  Let's throw dirt and cement on it.  So where they were digging now turned into this excavation site to preserve the ship.  Just another delay down there at the site.  That's fantastic.  Keep going.  You'll find dinosaurs, too.  Yeah.  These ships were transporting dinosaurs.  Enough with this fucking ship.  Who cares?  It's old.  Wave at it and cover it with cement. 
[00:46:00]  Wouldn't that be fucked up if they realized that's what Mohammed Atta was going for?  The ship that was buried underneath the trade center.  He heard there was treasure in it.  Yes.  Fuck him.  Fuck his mother.  So does that mean they're not going to build because they got to get the ship out of there first?  Well, you got to fucking excavate the site and make sure everything, there's nothing fucking valuable in there.  You know how they excavate with stupid toothbrushes?  Oh, my God.  Toothbrushes, teaspoons.  They put strings up.  Oh, my God.  Takes forever.  When I was in Greece, I saw that firsthand. 
[00:46:30]  Oh.  You're right.  They put fucking string up.  And a guy worked for eight hours to remove maybe a cup of dirt.  It's like, are you fucking kidding me?  Cup of dirt?  Cup of dirt?  A little, like, toothbrush type of thing.  Was it a cup of dirt in it?  Yeah, and then they had to study the dirt that they brushed to make sure that wasn't anything.  How did they fit in the ass sex?  It looked exhausting.  It's Greece.  Yeah, they're the ass.  Love of Christ. 
[00:47:00]  They have sex all over the place.  Yeah, they love it.  In the Parthenon.  They're just sitting in the Parthenon, fucking each other in the ass.  Lucky them.  Yes, of course.  Who is that?  Who is that?  What?  Yeah, I don't have any idea.  I see some new faces in the hallway.  A little dish just walked by.  A little dish, a dish.  A little dish walked by.  A tomato.  Who is she?  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  Is that an intern-y thing or short hair? 
[00:47:30]  What's going on?  Danny, do a little recon.  One, two, three, four computers down.  Stick your thumb in her butt and see if she goes to HR.  Stick her cock out the door and wiggle it.  Yeah, we've got to see what kind of a gal she is.  And dress her by race.  Right.  We've got to see what kind of a gal she is.  Danny's going out there.  He's in the hallway now.  He's walking up to her.  Wow, he's walking right up to her.  And starting a discussion or just recon?  Danny doesn't do recon.  Danny does, like, fucking, how do you do? 
[00:48:00]  You've got to look around.  Troy Kwan and his fucking tiny t-shirt.  I'm tired of Troy's fucking tiny t-shirts.  Troy's little t-shirt and his fucking, obviously, Bob's big boy hairdo.  His long fucking, his long torso.  I'm buying mediums.  Who decides that their hair is going to be like that?  Like, it's not a do you see on everybody.  It's a guy that has a lot of confidence.  You think it's the confidence factor?  He gets a lot of chicks.  He really does.  Troy Kwan does very well.  Like, but who's going to do that? 
[00:48:30]  Who's going to do that and then realize, like, this works for me?  Jimmy doesn't like your tight t-shirt, Troy Kwan.  Yeah, you have, like, a long torso.  Hold on, before we get to Troy, Danny, what did you find out?  Danny, recon, what's going on?  Did you stick your thumb up her butt?  I didn't want to be too obvious, but I'm pretty sure that's one of Shade's interns.  Oh, what, what race?  Are you kidding me?  What race are we talking about?  That's going to bum out Anthony.  What race?  White girl like that working for Blackstaff.  I'm getting different intel.  Bitch!  Son of a bitch! 
[00:49:00]  Sex Bagel tells me she's a mashup intern.  No.  Mashup?  Oh, Troy Kwan says no.  Troy Kwan just called E-Rock an asshole.  Troy Kwan?  I can't see her.  Should I go take a look?  Yeah.  You want her in here?  Well, no, you're not getting enough.  Jimmy doesn't like your tight t-shirt.  I don't dislike it.  I just said it just creeped me up.  Sorry, man.  And when did you start with the hair?  Now, I know your hair is a very big part of who you are and your look and everything.  Like, when did you start with that and why? 
[00:49:30]  My hair is really thick, so it's hard to do anything with it.  Stop bragging.  I try to have it long.  It's just too much to deal with.  Look at your future.  Look around the room and see your future.  But it goes, like, right up.  Like, up.  You didn't do a side thing.  You didn't do a back thing.  You didn't cut it a little.  I used to part it to the side, and then everybody was like, oh, you look like Hitler Youth.  You have way too much hair now that I think about it.  You do have a lot of hair.  But it's not that, like, illegal alien hairline that goes down the eyebrows. 
[00:50:00]  Like, you've got a forehead and everything.  But once the hairline hits, it fucking hits.  You are full of hair.  I just make it look ridiculous.  You know what I mean?  I just make it stand up.  It goes, like, straight up.  You use product in that?  I do.  I do a little product.  I don't wash my hair ever.  You don't wash it ever?  Maybe, like, once every two, three weeks.  You get in the shower, what do you do?  You just armpits, you crotch your asshole, and you leave your hair?  Yeah, I don't put shampoo or anything in it.  Wow.  Aren't you worried about, like, dandruff?  No. 
[00:50:30]  You don't get it?  You don't get it?  Doesn't your hair smell?  Uh, I don't know.  I can't smell it.  It smells hair.  What was that dumb doll with the hair that sticks up?  Distressed doll.  Fucking help me out.  Somebody.  Oh, the troll dolls?  Was it the troll dolls?  Where the hair just stood up?  It is Bob's Big Boy.  Have you been called the Bob's Big Boy?  Oh, yeah, I get that all the time.  That's the big one?  Yeah.  But fuck the guy, because any time a guy comments on whatever I'm wearing or looking like or  doing that, I write it off and just go, you're a faggot. 
[00:51:00]  So, I'm not even talking about guys.  Girls, they dig it?  They love it.  See?  That's all that matters, though.  It gets a lot of pussy.  It's all that fucking matters.  It gets a lot of pussy.  When guys talk about it, because do guys go like, what the fuck is with your hair?  Yeah, you look like Bob's Big Boy.  What's with your hair?  And I go, you're a guy.  I just disregard it.  Shut up.  I don't care.  All right, listen, Troy Kwan, it's good you're in here, because we'll play this going into  break.  Your song, the metal version of Mel's Smile and Blow Me, is doing very well. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Very fucking hard rock.  I heard Jason Ellis played it on his show yesterday, Liquid Metal's playing it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's cool.  What the fuck is that about?  Just getting some SiriusXM love.  It's pretty cool, no?  People are loving the Mel.  Well, we got to play the two-bar.  Yeah, that was a good one.  We'll do that after.  That was a good one.  Supposedly, tape number six comes out today at 8.30.  Are you kidding me?  And you know what?  I've been studying the tapes a little bit and listening to some reports on it. 
[00:52:00]  They're saying the tapes were doctored by her side.  Maybe.  I think it's...  It's still Mel raging, but they're making it sound like it's one conversation.  They're starting to think it's a lot of different conversations and a lot of shit is left out of  it, and she had a professional microphone, so this was set up in advance.  Are people also saying that she, like, looped some shit? 
[00:52:30]  What do you mean looped?  Like, took her shit out, that wound him up, and put in stuff that made it sound like she  was being calm, cool, and collective.  They're saying there's audio fades in there and all sorts of...  They were using a lot of, you know, technical shit.  She's a cunt.  That it's obvious that these tapes were doctored on her side.  Pins and needles, needles and pins, a happy man is a man who grins, you cunt.  With that, we'll go to break with Troy Kwan's metal version of Smile and Blow Me. 
[00:53:00]  Break in the ass!  Listen to what you do to me.  You make my life so fucking difficult.  So just fucking listen to me.  Break in the ass!  Listen to my fucking ranting.  This is me!  Get it?  You get it now?  You're such a fucking...  Smile and Blow Me!  Smile!  What the...  What?  Smile and Blow Me!  Smile!  You have no fucking soul! 
[00:53:30]  Smile and Blow Me!  Smile!  You sick of your bullshit!  Smile and Blow Me!  Smile!  Fuck you!  You don't care.  You don't care.  I need a woman!  Not a fucking little girl with a fucking dysfunctional butt!  I need a fucking woman!  Smile and Blow Me!  Smile!  That just fucking sucks me drunk!  Smile and Blow Me! 
[00:54:00]  Smile!  You have no fucking soul!  Smile and Blow Me!  Smile!  Smile and Blow Me!  Because I deserve it!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Show.  The virus on Sirius XM.  We lost JFK Jr. 11 years ago today. 
[00:54:30]  Wow.  11 years ago?  That was a quick 11 years, huh?  Damn!  Damn!  What else is going on?  Wow, what year is...  Why is one of the top searches today, China UFO?  I don't know this one.  You didn't see this yet?  No.  It's a UFO that looks like a giant clit. 
[00:55:00]  It's a UFO!  Double UFO!  It shut down the airport.  I forget which airport in China, but it shut it down for about an hour.  Some people say it's military.  Some people say it's a regular airliner on fire or something like that.  Is it video?  Um, there actually is video, but the still is a little better.  I'll try to find it for you.  Yeah, I don't know what to think when it comes to UFOs.  It's a cool picture, nonetheless.  Are they staying away because we all have our fucking camera phones now? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They're just staying away.  Yeah, they're steering clear.  That is what I would call a, um...  So we're looking at...  A meteorite.  Yeah, we're looking at a streak across the sky, basically, right?  Yeah.  A little smear.  It's like a little, uh, light, little smear across the sky.  Looks like an underpants smear.  But then you see something above the smear that looks like, uh, uh, some kind of a structure  with maybe windows or something.  No, you don't.  It could be something.  Yeah, you don't.  See, look at that, up top. 
[00:56:00]  Right above the smear.  Let me see the smear.  Let me pull it up nice and big.  Uh, Danny's gonna enhance.  Oh, fuck, I do see that.  Enhance.  Was that photoshopped?  Enhance.  Is that photoshopped?  No.  No, no, no.  There's video.  What?  From a video.  See, look, there's little windows.  And look, you can see alien faces.  They're sucking each other's cocks.  They're faggots.  From the planet Fagola.  Can you see, uh, the windows in the video?  Can you?  The video, um, this still isn't from the video I saw. 
[00:56:30]  The video I saw, it just kind of looks like, uh, you see something streaking.  It almost looks like, uh, like a, you know, like a meteorite or something like that, because  you just see kind of, like, trails behind some kind of thing.  It's probably a military.  Can we see it?  Yeah.  I'd love to see the video.  Yeah, that's a, that's a little weird.  It's a really cool picture.  I don't care.  You know the military has to test all sorts of shit before they tell us about it.  It is.  It's, it's some kind of, every UFO is some military bullshit.  Like the, the stealth bomber, right?  Yeah, when that was going around, the skunk works. 
[00:57:00]  They had to test that shit.  That was probably, uh, looked at as a UFO by a lot of people.  All the time, they were getting fucking, uh, Area 51 bullshit about UFOs during the testing  of the, the, um, F-117 and the, the B-1 bomber.  Yeah, it's all bullshit.  That or meteor.  A lot of meteors.  I, or I say swamp gas.  Swamp gas.  A lot of swamp gas.  I never bought that one, by the way.  This is it?  Mm-hmm.  Look at that shit. 
[00:57:30]  That looks pretty.  What the fuck is that?  That looks pretty cool.  Obviously, you can find this yourself on, uh, YouTube.  It looks too primitive to be some kind of a fucking, you know, advanced technology that  came all the way here, and it's spraying out a thing that looks like a fucking sprinkler.  Is it going slow or no?  It's kind of hard to tell.  It's just kind of hanging there.  Oh, it's far away, right?  Maybe it's far.  So they couldn't, did this thing land anywhere?  It looks like a giant stingray.  Like a giant stingray, but white.  Like, that's what it looks like in the sky. 
[00:58:00]  The, uh, the, uh, what it's pushing out.  According to the reports that I was reading, it didn't, it didn't show up on radar, and  it shut down, uh, their airport.  They were going to their major airports for about an hour.  Didn't they follow it to see where the fuck it was going?  They were right, but they don't like to comment on strange things.  Eh, no comment!  Don't you follow something like this and go, all right, where the fuck is this going?  What are they going to follow it with, a bottle rocket?  I don't know, man.  I think the word spreads quickly, and you could kind of keep following it.  Especially China's military, man.  If the radar didn't pick it up, that's one thing. 
[00:58:30]  That's a little weird, man.  But, uh, some other, I guess, articles were saying, you know, like, if it is military,  why would they be testing it where, you know, everybody could see it right next to a commercial  airport?  But they wouldn't shut down an airport for an hour.  Yeah.  Something went on, but they ain't fessing.  Did you guys make the Chinese accent joke yet?  Eh, what look at this?  Kevin from Connecticut.  It was an unidentified frying, frying object.  Oh, that's funny.  Frying, frying object. 
[00:59:00]  Ah, we can't get fired here for doing Asian humor.  Get it?  It was frying.  It's a frying object.  Unidentified frying object.  Very good, Kevin.  That's good.  That's, uh.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, who the fuck knows?  Yeah, I don't know.  I say it's military.  Yeah, I'm sure it's military.  Yeah.  And maybe it's not close to the airport.  Maybe it's a lot further in the distance. 
[00:59:30]  It's like a rear view of the Millennium Falcon.  Yeah, that's pretty cool, though.  All that light and shit.  Let it play out with the windows.  What the fuck is that?  That's the same thing?  That's pretty cool.  That's enhanced.  There you go, meteor.  That has to be enhanced.  Come on, someone fucking, you know how they are.  What the hell is that?  Circle.  Now it's just other videos.  Now it's other videos of Frisbee.  Pretty soon there'll be somebody getting a fucking face shit in, like in a wedding dress.  I'll make us sexy.  That look good. 
[01:00:00]  I like this sexy shit video.  Are you guys sick of the Mel Gibson remakes?  No.  Well.  I'm not.  No.  Well.  You want to replay the two-bar one and then we can play two new ones?  Let's hear a new one.  Yes.  I'd love to hear a new one.  Let's play this one first.  It'll still be new for a lot of people.  Oh yeah, the two-bar one was fucking great.  Yeah, we played that late in the show yesterday, so I'm sure there's a lot of people hearing  this for the first time.  We'll try to get this online a little later today.  Yeah, it's a good one.  D-Boy took the Mel Gibson audio and good old red from the two-bar tapes. 
[01:00:30]  Here's the girl again.  Here's the dish is walking by again.  The dish.  The dish.  That's the dish.  Oh, is that her?  Oh.  Follow her.  See where she's going.  She's a dish.  I wouldn't mind having some supple or whatever, you know?  So here's D-Boy's latest creation.  Hello?  Fucking embarrassment to me.  Oh?  You look like a fucking bitch on heat. 
[01:01:00]  Who do you want to talk to?  And if you get raped by a pack of niggers, it'll be your fault.  Why'd you go out and fuck your mother, you son of a bitch?  You'd be a nice guy, ain't you?  Hello?  Stay on this phone and don't hang out for me.  I can't.  I have plenty of energy to drive over there.  Oh?  What company do you want?  You should just fucking smile and blow me.  Yeah, come over here.  I'll suck your prick.  I deserve to be blown first.  Sure.  I'll cut your fucking prick off.  Blow me first.  Well, you motherfucker cocksucker. 
[01:01:30]  Why don't you come over and talk to me person to person?  Hello?  You need a fucking pat on the side of the head.  But you ain't got the nerve, you fucking bum.  No, you're all angry now.  Come on down, you son of a bitch.  I'll give you a $50 reward.  What put you in a fucking rose garden, you cunt?  What?  You understand that?  Because I'm capable of it.  You understand that?  Why don't you come down, you yellow son of a bitch.  For what?  You motherfucker bum.  Fucking blow me, bitch.  If anybody would say that to me, I'd come down and fight him. 
[01:02:00]  Fuck you.  Dan, that could be the best one.  That is a good one.  That really works, huh?  That is a real good one, man.  So we got one from Producer Dan.  Danny was saying this was all right?  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  I liked it.  They took the Mel Gibson audio, Producer Dan did, and did a little Pulp Fiction thing.  Oh!  Did he do the say what again?  Anyone doing the say what again?  Don't ruin it.  Come on.  We didn't even listen.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, you were finished.  Fuck you.  Well, allow me to retort.  What the fuck?  What are you going to say?  What does Marcellus Wallace look like?  What?  What country are you from?  What?  Well, there ain't no country I ever heard of.  They speak English in what?  What?  English, motherfucker.  Describe what Marcellus Wallace looks like.  Say what again.  Say what again.  I dare you.  I double dare you, motherfucker. 
[01:03:00]  Say what one more goddamn time.  Allow me.  Does he look like a bitch?  Oh!  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I break your concentration?  No!  And then you're telling me that...  I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing.  You ever had a big kahuna burger?  No!  Hey, Producer Dan, right on, man.  That's good.  Right on.  Good job with that.  Anything but Samuel L.  And we got this one. 
[01:03:30]  Is this D-Boy again?  D-Boy is like...  Norton's mom?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Norton's mom.  Is this D-Boy?  And Mel Gibson.  Good.  Okay.  This is D-Boy.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here, but we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  What the fuck were you going to say?  You're talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening.  What the fuck do you hope you'll accomplish with that? 
[01:04:00]  I deserve to be blown.  I spent more than five million dollars.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  Don't dare you.  So I was thinking, you know, you have a nice gym downstairs.  What?  What?  You could exercise, and you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  You fucking offended me.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just, I'm thinking of you. 
[01:04:30]  Nobody knows I'm calling.  You know, right now, you don't care about anyone but yourself.  It's you.  Don't get offended or think I'm strange, but I am a mother, and I worry about you.  Look at yourself, and look what you've done.  You fucking excuse for a mother.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on.  I know it's not my business.  But, anyway, I love you, and I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license. 
[01:05:00]  Anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie?  I love you.  Thanks.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  That's great.  You should have told her to blow you or called her a cunt, but that was great.  I think you were showing respect there.  I know.  You didn't have to.  That was very, very funny.  That is really good, D-boy.  Great job, man.  That's a whole stack of remixes now.  Oh, brother.  Oh, God.  By the way, can I say how happy I am that this fucking cunt, Lynn Stewart, this fat fucking 
[01:05:30]  pig who defended Omar Abdelrahman, the blind sheik, was passing messages for him while he  was in jail to his followers, this fucking slob.  And the judge gave her 28 months, and the fat woman with facial hair was out.  She looked like Lou Costello if he didn't die.  And she said, I could do 28 months standing on my head.  Can you?  Well, apparently fatso will be on her dorsal fin because the judge, it really annoyed him. 
[01:06:00]  So they reconsidered, and now they gave her 10 years.  10 years.  So hopefully, because she showed no remorse in her interview, hopefully this pig will  die in jail.  Good.  Good.  Defending that piece of shit.  Wow, the wife.  Just another one of these guilt-ridden, liberal, asshole lawyers.  I just hate her because of passing the messages.  Yeah.  And then apparently she lied on the stand. 
[01:06:30]  Whatever she did, I hope she dies in jail.  The judge was like, no, I'm not good enough.  And it's not, I don't hate her, like, and anyone that goes, yeah, well, she defended him,  that's why she's in jail.  Hey, Ron Cooby's defended some motherfuckers, he ain't in jail.  Man, everyone needs a stupid-ass fucking lawyer.  You gotta have a lawyer.  So, uh, but she did some shit that was, uh, above and beyond being an asshole.  Yep.  Defending somebody.  Oh, she broke down in sobs.  She, she said the original sentence would allow her to see the horizon.  Bye-bye. 
[01:07:00]  Yep, see ya.  Bye-bye.  Hopefully ya fuckin' croak in there with a plunger up ya cunt.  70 years old.  I hope she never gets out of jail.  She's filth.  So, that's it.  Bit of good news.  Yeah.  Also, uh, I was saying earlier, uh, BP capped the well.  They capped their little well.  They're doing a little pressure test on it to make sure that the shit below the cap doesn't blow out.  Uh, I didn't like hearing that on the news.  A lot of people, a lot of these people like, uh, making a little more drama. 
[01:07:30]  You know, when they, when they look at the camera now and there's not that billowing oil coming out, they go, well, what can we say?  All right, we could say that there's a chance that the pipe below the cap now can blow out.  Uh, so BP's doing testing on it and shit.  But, um, you know something?  When I speculate and go to buy a goddamn stock on nothing but a hunch, I don't want to hear bullshit like that, okay?  Imagine if it worked and it stopped the leak, but it backed up everything else, and then for no reason, like, Lithuania is blown off the planet. 
[01:08:00]  Like, it blows out the back of the Earth.  You think the stock would go down?  Oh, would we be in trouble?  I think so.  Like, they're showing footage of oceans and people just being sucked into space.  BP saying they couldn't fix the hole in the Earth.  Sorry, yeah.  So, we got the well thing, but we can't fix holes in the Earth.  And Steve Jobs knew about the problem, but he liked the little circle so much, they refused to fix it. 
[01:08:30]  Boo.  Not a fan of Steve Jobs, huh?  No, I despise him.  But I think he's a genius, and I love Apple products.  I love them.  I think he got a little too greedy.  It's disgusting, dude.  Getting a little too greedy.  The way they gouge people where they don't have to.  There's a business thing.  You got to make a lot of money.  They're brilliant.  But then there's a certain point where they're just purposely withholding things and fucking you.  And it's like, do you have to every time do it, man?  Do you think that's just business? 
[01:09:00]  To a point, yes.  I really do.  But I think they take it further than most companies.  I really do, yes.  Not giving out those bumpers when they well knew the fucking problem.  That's not business.  That's just, let's make an extra $30 million.  But do you think that was an afterthought?  Or do you think they said, let's put in a fucking problem in the phone that can only be fixed with this bumper and will sell the bumper?  No, absolutely not.  I don't think that would.  No, I don't think it's that dirty, no.  Yeah, I don't think it's that dirty. 
[01:09:30]  I think they just didn't fix the problem because he liked the design.  I think the class action suit's going to cost them a lot more money than handing out the fucking bumpers.  Absolutely.  Someone's on the line.  We didn't get to them saying that they're going to just hand out the bumpers.  How about the $30 I paid for it?  Do I get a $30 credit?  There you go, right?  Oh, yeah.  Well, maybe that's what they did.  I think I'd like it.  Decided to let it hang out there for a few days so they'd make money from people like you buying the bumpers,  and then they'll finally come out and go, all right, now we're going to get these out for free.  What if people say, I don't like that bumper.  I want to use my phone without it. 
[01:10:00]  Then what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you get?  That's what I do.  Look at me.  I rock bareback.  I rock my phone bareback, my friend.  No rubber on my phone.  That's how I am.  And I hold it with my thumb and middle finger.  And I put my pinky out and I go, hello?  Hello?  Let me see if it does anything.  I'm going to do the old test.  I got the fucking bars of service.  And this is how I hold my phone if I have to make a phone call.  So we'll just, you guys just talk and I'll just take a look. 
[01:10:30]  No, no, you can't hold it like that.  Your pinky's fucking the whole system up.  You can't do that.  What are you doing?  Hold different.  Like a big Apple logo with a big hold different.  The people, the Apple haters are really having a field day with this.  They should, though.  Have you seen the surgery photo where they show the pinky finger and the ring finger surgically removed and stitched up and someone holding the phone like that?  Like, just cut your fingers off and you won't have a problem. 
[01:11:00]  It dropped bars before, hasn't it yet?  Yeah, I mean, look.  It makes them look horrible.  I mean, it makes them look really fucking bad.  I want to FaceTime you.  Let's do it.  I want to FaceTime you.  Do you guys knock?  You want to FaceTime me?  Did you see the other fucking app, by the way?  No.  Which one?  You don't knock?  iChatR.  Where you can randomly just fucking scan people?  What? 
[01:11:30]  What?  What?  What do you mean randomly scan people?  Because I did a little app surfing last night with my iPad and my iPhone.  I got the one where I can take photos from my iPhone and transfer them over to my iPad, which is very good.  I want to get that.  What's it called?  That's a good one.  It's called Transfer.  Danny, could you show me how to sign in?  No.  Just tell me the app. 
[01:12:00]  Very good.  I like that one.  Because I was able to take pictures, and then you put them on the iPad, and you look at them, and you're like, wow.  It's an automatic transfer, right, without a plug?  Yeah.  Jonathan has that.  Because for the most part, when you look on the iPhone, I mean, they look good and shit, but the pictures are only as big as a fucking screen.  And you look on an iPad, and you're like, fuck, you know, that's a nice, big, vibrant picture.  And I also got an app that you could edit the pictures a little bit and enhance, enhance, enhance them with color. 
[01:12:30]  Or I could do a film noir look.  Or an old Polaroid if I choose to.  I'm going crazy.  I'm just going wild with my apps on my iPad.  Love the iPad now.  Hated it.  Oh, you could pull audio on me just shitting on it.  Actually opening it up and taking a fucking projectile diarrhea shit all over the iPad.  But now, it's my bestest friend. 
[01:13:00]  I am the same worm.  Bestest friend ever.  I'm the same worm.  I bought a couple movies because I got a flight today.  Yeah, see?  So I bought a couple movies.  And you know what?  You'll be there with your stupid little case, with the stupid thing standing up on your little  stupid fucking dinner tray.  Dude, I admit, I'm a fucking bitch Mac fanboy.  I know.  I should have an Apple tattooed on me and go, look at that, fucking pro.  I'm a guy who's always going to be an Apple fan, so this was part of my life.  That's why I got the tattoo.  I bleed Apple's silver antenna. 
[01:13:30]  Fucking asshole sports fan.  Hey, dude, I bleed giant blue.  Yeah, you should, asshole.  All that money you pay, and they're going to sit you behind a post because they don't  care about you at all.  Dunce.  Let's go to Eddie in St. Louis.  Good old Eddie.  You know Eddie.  Eddie.  Hey, guys.  I just had a couple of points to add on the Apple thing.  Back in October of 07, they filed a lawsuit about the AT&T exclusivity.  It just went class action a couple of days ago.  So if you bought a phone after June 29, 07, you're now part of it. 
[01:14:00]  The crazy thing is now is that they're going to be facing this one class action lawsuit.  But if you look at the total cost of what it would cost to, you know, recall the new  iPhones that are fucked up, it would be about $1.5 billion.  That's about 3.5% of the cash that Apple has on hand.  These motherfuckers care more about $1.5 billion than their corporate reputation.  So now, even if they fix the bumper thing and it doesn't cost the consumers anything  because of the poor performance of the 4G and the battery being drained, they're still 
[01:14:30]  probably going to get hit with another suit.  They're not, they don't care really about losing customers because they're not going  to.  Well, I'll tell you why they should care.  The fucking stock's down 7% right now and some people are talking about like it could  be down a fifth to a third by the end of the month.  I mean, they're going to get hit in the pocket.  And then you know what happens?  Their earnings will come out and the fucking thing will go right up.  This fucking, this app is called iChat R and you randomly swipe through people who are  on.  It's usually just guys.  But like, you can see them and they see you. 
[01:15:00]  So wait.  I just saw a puckered asshole on there.  And when, look at my neck.  Guys will fucking scoot right past me.  But wait a minute.  Now, the people on the bottom screen are just on right now on this.  On their own eye, their chat.  It's like, dude, you just, you're going to, look, that's somebody else.  Well, you can go into a private eye chat.  There's a guy's penis.  Look.  Why is it all dick and asshole things?  Because women aren't going to play with their pussies here.  No, but I mean, are you in some kind of special room?  No, you just sign into the app.  Sign on.  Wait, so you could get into people's private eye chats? 
[01:15:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You have to be.  They're signed into this app, too.  Oh, okay.  I see.  Yeah, this must be a public.  A guy's head.  I signed it off.  Yeah.  Guys jack off.  I saw a chick sucking a guy's dick once the first night we got.  Oh, this guy's penis.  Look.  Look at him showing his heart.  And he just, he signed out on me immediately.  Yeah, what happened there?  Oh, what's that?  Is that a girl?  Is she looking at you right now?  Yeah, I'm the only one.  She signed out.  Oh, okay.  So it's not a bunch of people watching me.  It's one at a time? 
[01:16:00]  One, yeah.  So it's kind of like.  Signs on, sees you, and just goes, fuck this guy.  Yeah, when there's a girl there, all weekend we had it.  And when I was in Montreal, we were doing it with Bob Kelly, and we would have like one  of the girls, so the people would stay on, and then we would put our faces in, and get  everybody's vibe.  That is hysterical.  So you could wipe out of the people, and then get someone new.  Oh, look.  See how long he laughs at Jimmy D. He's laughing at you, Jim. 
[01:16:30]  He's laughing.  And then he's gone.  He's signed out.  That was it.  Oh, look.  It's like chat roulette for the iPhone, pretty much.  Oh, that's great.  But it's all dudes.  It was one girl.  Chip gets signed out of really quick.  Chip's face never makes it.  Yeah, look at that horrible face.  Eddie, you done with your knowledge there?  Oh, yeah.  That's about it.  All right.  Yeah, I'm going to be watching that press conference a little later this morning.  See what that's all about.  See what that deal is.  Can I ask you guys one question? 
[01:17:00]  Are you going to buy any Apple products in the future?  Yes!  Well, I mean, I'm...  Bob's here?  I'm sorry.  I'm guilty of loving the MacBook Pro, but I don't have anything else at this point from  them.  No?  Nope.  You would love the iPhone.  You would?  Nope.  Yeah, you would.  Everyone around me has it.  I just refuse to do it.  Yeah, but I don't know.  I don't know why.  Because you have AT&T.  The BlackBerry's awful.  You would love it.  I like my BlackBerry.  You don't.  You're sick of it.  No, you don't.  Touchscreen. 
[01:17:30]  It's looking a little dated right now.  I'll be honest.  All those little teeny buttons.  What?  What's wrong with buttons?  They're the worst, dude.  They're the worst.  You don't need them anymore.  If you had Verizon, I'd stick with you.  I'd be with you, but you got that fucking BlackBerry subway and get rid of it.  I'm waiting for the next Pebble to come out.  You're pulling into the parking lot with a Ford Pinto.  And StarTac's going to put out a new phone in the very near future.  And I'll be back in.  I'll be competing once again with the smartphone world.  You'll be right up there.  That's right.  Why, Eddie, you don't buy anything from Apple?  You know, honestly, I've always been kind of an open source guy. 
[01:18:00]  I use Linux.  I built my own computer.  Open source guy?  What?  You're one of those guys?  You build your own computer?  I really don't like the idea of giving these cocksuckers any money.  I mean, of course, you have to.  Man!  It just seems to me like if they really display the kind of contempt for their customers,  and they have all this brain power, and they can't get it right,  and they can't anticipate little nagging bullshit like this.  I mean, what kind of respect do they have for people?  You know what? 
[01:18:30]  I love my stupid iPhone.  I like this one a lot, actually.  I don't like it.  I don't have a fucking bumper on it.  All right.  I haven't had a problem.  Here's a guy that works at an Apple store.  Steve, what are you seeing?  Yes!  I'm seeing penises, and I love it.  Steve.  Yeah, Steve.  Steve in Queens.  Hey, what's up?  I had a fight with Apple this week.  They would not give me any help because I had a 3G, and it didn't work with the 4 software. 
[01:19:00]  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, they pulled an iPhone 4 out and asked me if I wanted to buy it.  So I bought it.  And my XM SkyDoc, which I listen to you guys all the time, will not work with this stupid phone.  So I fought with them.  Then they offered me something free from the store, and I couldn't find anything I wanted.  But if I do find something, they're going to make me find legal paperwork, releasing them any responsibilities.  Really?  Really. 
[01:19:30]  I don't think they could do that.  The SkyDoc is a completely different...  It's a different design.  It's a different phone.  No, it's not.  The SkyDoc is a...  Are you guys screwing with me, and I'm going to leave?  No, no, no.  What?  No, we're not.  We're confused, actually.  SkyDoc was made for the 3GS.  I think we should have hung up plenty a minute ago, but we're now confused.  You're a misinformation guy.  So you had some problems with Apple, and they want to...  Because...  We have an Apple expert.  Who?  Bob!  He knows more about computers than all of us, except maybe Anthony. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, my God.  He does, though.  Is he here?  Yes.  So how come XM SkyDoc won't work with...  We don't know, sir.  We're not technical people.  Because the iPhone 4 is a different design than the iPhone 3G or the 3GS, so it just doesn't  fit.  All right.  It's not that the phone doesn't work.  It's that it doesn't fit.  What do you got?  I still love you guys.  No, that's fine.  Steve, you're all right.  Listen, quick break, and Bob Kelly will join the program.  Bob! 
[01:20:30]  Bobby.  Let's check this out.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  We welcome Bob Kelly into the studio.  We got Jimmy for a little while, then you got to fly out, right, Jimmy?  No!  Jimmy.  What happened?  I'm surprised that the cock's been missed one.  Are you flying out? 
[01:21:00]  I'm flying out in a little while to Montreal.  Montreal Comedy Festival?  For tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  At least you didn't rape anyone.  You could get in the country.  Rip.  Just the audience.  Rip.  Just the audience.  And I'm back for my birthday on Monday.  Yeah.  Is it your real birthday or the fake birthday for 364 days?  Oh, July 16th today.  I don't even know when your birthday is anymore.  I used to know.  The 19th is Jimmy's birthday. 
[01:21:30]  Okay.  The 19th.  So that's the only day where no one wishes you a happy birthday.  I won't even be in, by the way.  I won't make it in because I landed eight.  That's how the bitch should work.  I'll be back Tuesday.  The only day you don't get a birthday wish.  But nobody can resist wishing me a happy birthday because I'm a sweet boy.  He'll do it for months.  Every fucking day we hear that.  I wish I was up there with you.  Fucking day.  You could have went for bone marrow on your birthday.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking we were up in Montreal and we went out with our chicks and fucking Bob.  Bob's trying so hard just to be anything what he is, which is just a Boston fucking angry racist. 
[01:22:00]  And he tries to be cultured.  You know what, dude?  And he wrote his fucking bone marrow.  It was so funny.  Oh, stop.  You didn't.  Because he wanted to taste it.  But, dude, these giant fucking cow kneecaps show up.  You know, when you see it on TV, you see it on TV, it's like a little thin bone.  You get one.  They brought me fucking dinosaur shins.  This fucking thing was...  Ankles and knees.  You know, like when you see the... 
[01:22:30]  They're probably in better shape than yours, though.  I broke my knee, man.  I sucked the marrow out of my knee, dude.  Hold my hoof.  So, it's just a loud plate of fucking knees and ankles.  Dude, three giant bones.  And then what, a little fork to pluck the marrow out?  Like you're eating lobster?  No, it's like a lobster thing.  A soup ladle.  Those giant fucking bones.  They give you little tiny crisps to put the bone marrow on and sea salt. 
[01:23:00]  That sounds horrible.  That's when people were starving.  I don't eat food that people ate when they were starving.  Hey, get a steak.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  I was trying to be...  What did it taste like?  I was trying to be...  I saw a fat Andrew Zimmerman suck it down in Bali.  Give me the escargot.  I hate Zimmerman.  Yeah, you know what?  I like...  He ruins that fucking show.  That show is great if he wasn't the host.  I hate the way he eats.  He's the bald guy, right?  Yeah, the bald guy.  That pretends he's not, huh? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, but he...  That pretends he's not, huh?  Oh, yeah.  He's got a wife and kids.  But he...  Yeah.  But he has an orange watch.  Yeah, I don't know what he's got.  Anybody with an orange watch?  This fucking guy eats the shittiest shit around the world.  And not once he goes, holy fuck, that sucked.  The only thing he did was...  Everything he liked.  That fruit he puked on.  I didn't see that episode.  There's a fruit.  There's some type of fruit.  It's a white fruit.  Sweet bear wine!  And he likes eating a lot of animal genitals.  Yeah.  Who doesn't?  What's that about?  This is Bob Thumbar.  It's bone marrow, by the way. 
[01:24:00]  Can you see that?  I see the bone marrow.  It's fucking horrible.  Yeah, big bones.  So you saw him do it, so you decided you need to do it.  I thought it would come in one little appetizer, appetizer, bone marrow, nugget.  And I could eat it a couple bites and then put it away.  Three huge, just fucking shins came out.  Do you like it?  It was...  I mean, it tastes like a steak bouillon cube.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, like if you just...  Very, very...  But just like one that somebody cummed on. 
[01:24:30]  Very salty and shit.  Like if a cow cummed on a bouillon cube.  Really?  It was salty?  It was salty.  And then you're supposed to put sea salt on it because it...  Why?  Because it's creamy.  But it's salty.  Why would you put more salt on it?  And then it goes in your throat and it hardens like load.  Not that I know what load hardens.  Why would you eat this shit?  Now, here's the question.  When did you start hating the dish?  How many bites in?  Three.  We've all done that and you get so depressed.  Mistake.  Three bites in and I was fucking trying not to throw up. 
[01:25:00]  So you didn't even finish...  Yeah, because I mean, it wasn't just the grossest of it.  It was like fucking molestation issues were coming up.  Because I was holding Bob's head and forcing it down onto the bone marrow.  You didn't finish the first knee?  No, I took a...  You left the last two knees?  This is what such white trash I am.  I didn't want the waiter, who's probably a fucking scumbag rapist himself.  Doesn't even...  Can't afford to even eat at the restaurant we're at.  I didn't want him to think I was uncultured.  So I took a little bite of each one and kind of mushed it up inside so it looked like I ate all of it. 
[01:25:30]  Like most of it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I told Bobby, I says, just be careful.  Enjoy your food.  Uncle Paul.  And Bobby was telling us during the break, I think it's worth bringing up.  On air.  Fly fishing.  Ah.  I know we talk about fly fishing every time you hear it.  I was looking at our old videos and I want to go again.  But you were going to invite me to another fly fishing trip.  You went solo.  I didn't make it. 
[01:26:00]  Poughkeepsie.  And you said it was horrendous?  Poughkeepsie.  I don't know what the fuck.  I mean, it was...  I was fishing in fucking toxic waste.  I mean, I'm not even kidding you, dude.  I was stepping in shit.  Like, I was...  It was like...  Just like the future after a nuclear fucking bomb went off in Poughkeepsie.  Nuclear.  Yeah.  Nice targeting.  I can't say that on Marilyn.  Malloran.  Whatever the fuck it is.  You can't say Marilyn?  Malloran.  I don't know what it is.  My fucking landlord was Marilyn or some shit. 
[01:26:30]  Marilyn?  I can't say fucking...  What's that other one?  Florampapist.  Oh, what did you just say?  Florampapist.  I can't say that word either.  Try it.  Florampapist.  Florampapist.  Florampapist.  We've done this before, but I can't fucking say it.  I'll get it 20 minutes in.  I'll get it one time.  You'll all applaud.  Holy shit.  And then the next one will be fucking Florampapist.  Florantapist.  Florantapist.  I got it.  No, you don't.  Florantapist.  Florampapist.  Florampapist.  Fuck it.  Anyways.  I had a tough time with Differentiate the other day.  Differentiate. 
[01:27:00]  I had a tough time with that one the other day.  That's a tough one.  I can't get...  What's that?  Oxymoron fucks me up and...  Oxymoron.  Discombobulated.  You got both of them.  Discombobulated.  Those are easy.  Fly fishing in the toxic fucking river.  It was fun.  It's fucking...  Literally, I'm not kidding you.  This guy, Crazy Eddie.  This old, like, 90-year-old guy with a beard jumps out of the rhubarb.  And, like, he's got, like, a...  Rhubarb?  He's got a fucking bottle of...  Is rhubarb just growing? 
[01:27:30]  I don't know.  I just called it rhubarb because that's the only fucking bush I know.  And he...  You ever have a strawberry rhubarb pie?  No.  I never have either.  Oh, get one right the fuck now, Steve.  Rhubarb is sweet?  Get the...  Get it right the fuck now.  I'm going to turn you on to some strawberry rhubarb pie.  Good stuff.  You're going to curse me because, you know, I'm sure you would try to eat it.  I actually have had some of that and thought, like, rhubarb was going to suck, but it really  is good.  You know, it's the sweetness of the strawberries and then the rhubarb.  I'm telling you. 
[01:28:00]  How creepy would it be if you said, Steve, get me a strawberry rhubarb pie and he just  pulled it out of his pocket?  I have one always.  I keep it on me.  That's my name on you-hoo.  Steve Rhubarb.  So the crazy Eddie comes out of the rhubarb, which doesn't sound possible.  This cocksucker's got worms in a can.  Like, he's digging in the mud for worms.  And he's just like, hey!  He starts just talking to me.  He's like, yeah, I fish here all the time.  He walks down the fucking middle of the polluted river and just grabs fish with his teeth. 
[01:28:30]  Worms in a can?  That sounds like something gay dogs can't.  Yes!  I have worms in my can.  I got it at a rest stop.  Yes!  It's tied in closely with worms on the penis disease.  Sorry.  I don't know how I got it.  And my face and ass.  Face and ass!  So, it was just a toxic river.  It reminds me, I was doing some- 
[01:29:00]  Oh, you would have fucking killed me.  You would have been like, what?  Let's go, though.  Let's get our trip together.  I was doing some whitewater rafting in the Black River Gorge, which is above Syracuse.  I believe this goes back a bunch of years.  I gotta go whitewater rafting again.  It's the best experience ever.  But I'm feeling like I'm in nature.  It was really nice.  And about an hour in, I look over to the side of the river, and there's just pipes dumping sewage into the river.  I'm like, there goes my fucking nature experience.  They couldn't hide that fucking pipe?  I had the same thing, dude. 
[01:29:30]  You're looking up here to feel like we're in nature.  I looked up at one point, and I saw this big cement pipe sticking out of the dirt.  And there's like a park right behind it with kids playing.  They were doing some fucking salute to the troops.  It looked like it was beautiful.  And there's this pipe, this sewage pipe dripping out green shit.  The sludge that was coming out of this pipe, I'm like, really?  You couldn't put that underground so we didn't have to see it?  We know we dump into our rivers.  I don't want to see it, though.  It almost made me want to catch a fish just to get like a half trout, half flounder.  See what comes out. 
[01:30:00]  Just a fish with like an old man face or a baby face on it.  Hey, hey.  Welcome to Poughkeepsie, kid.  We got to go back up to...  Could you put me back in the water, please?  We got to go back up to Roscoe.  Roscoe.  Oh, yeah.  Is that where you were?  I might go Sunday.  No, that was the other...  That was...  Roscoe's good.  That was the, uh...  Roscoe's good.  The looker.  Huh?  The tomato just walked by again.  Yeah, the dish.  The dish.  The lovely young lady. 
[01:30:30]  The dish.  I don't know what's going on with the dish.  Let me tell you something.  How hot the chicks are in New York in the summer.  The wintertime, they're just fucking ugly bags.  Yep.  Just wrapped up and no makeup.  Bundled up.  The summertime, man.  Bundled.  With these skirts and the new thin sweaters and the fucking...  What's the new hot thing girls are wearing that is like...  You look and you just go, oh, my God.  Like, are tits out this year?  They got a t-shirt.  Clit stickers.  They got that...  They got that...  They got that...  Potato sack type of fucking dress thing. 
[01:31:00]  Potato sack dress.  Whatever it's called.  I don't know.  I don't like those.  Where it's poofy, but it goes way up.  It's poofy on the bottom.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like the old school sundress on a girl in the summertime.  Oh, sundress is a fucking dress.  Sundress is a rule.  I don't like this new sundress where the bottom then has, like, a fucking compartment  for fucking mashed potatoes.  What is that?  I don't know.  It's like...  It's the right girl.  Where is it?  It's all right.  I don't like them.  The new t-shirts that are, like, worn out. 
[01:31:30]  They're, like, you see-through and not see-through.  Did you see those?  Not see-what?  They're, like, see-through and not see-through.  Oh, not see-through.  It's like a worn-out t-shirt.  What'd you say?  It's a Nazi joke.  Don't worry about it.  But, yeah, I don't like those fucking dresses with the fucking little scoopy thing in there.  The right girl's wearing it.  It's all right, man.  No, you know what?  It's all right, man.  The right girl wearing that would look twice as good in a regular sundress.  Or naked.  Yes, you're right. 
[01:32:00]  Sundress is my favorite.  Did you have a problem in your compound yesterday, you were telling us?  Not a problem.  It's just, you know, eh, there are things.  Well, a lot of questions were being asked by Bob Kelly and something about sex in pools.  Sex in a pool or a jacuzzi or something like that.  Seems like a good idea until you're in the middle of doing it and realize, wow, this really is not fun.  In the movies, it's all romantic and everything like that.  But in real life-  Stallone and Sharon Stone.  Oh, all that.  Fucking in a shower for 40 minutes. 
[01:32:30]  The playboy mansion in the grotto.  Yeah.  And then the reality of it is-  You have to roll her up onto the fucking grotto and fuck her like a seal.  And then roll it back in.  I'm going to roll her up.  You're like a grunion.  Fucking just mating on the beach.  It sucks.  So, yeah, the pool or the jacuzzi is not really great for sex.  They fucking- 
[01:33:00]  Because water cleans that dirty pussy.  The lubricant.  Right.  That dirty juice.  It cleans it.  Your whole deal with foreplay and all that other happy horse shit is getting everything lubed up nicely.  Right?  So you get everything lubed up.  And then the water just washes it away in a pool.  It sounds all good.  You're rolling around in the pool.  You're doing something.  Or you're in the hot tub or something.  And then Danny brought up a great point.  It's like when you go to put your dick in, it's like when you had your windshield wipers on and there's not enough water on your windshield. 
[01:33:30]  So your wipers go, brr, brr, brr, brr.  That's what your dick does as it's going in.  The wiper gets stuck as it's going across the windshield.  Kind of like a pussy lip or something.  It sounds great.  You're in a fucking hot tub or the pool and it's romantic or something.  But the truth of the matter is, I'd rather be in a bed in a missionary position where you could just slide it in.  But you could get it done in a pool. 
[01:34:00]  Feel that fucking warm cake sensation.  You could get it done in a shower, though.  I hate showers.  No.  The water's not shooting up from below.  But it's still going down your forearm into the pussy.  You could get it done in a shower.  A lot easier than in a pool.  And nothing's worse than eating pussy in the shower.  Why?  I love it.  It doesn't smell like pussy.  No.  You know why?  It fucking...  All the water is channeled into your mouth.  So you're not getting pussy.  You're getting fucking water.  You've got to be a trout. 
[01:34:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  You've got to get a girl with a bunt.  So then the water cascades over your head.  And then you could actually shampoo your hair in her bunt spray.  She's a cunt that's a lean-to.  You're well-protected under the bunt.  And then blowjobs in the hot tub.  We were talking about blowjobs in a pool or a hot tub.  I love giving them.  Jimmy couldn't wait to say that.  And his mouth is so full of Bob's cock right now, he had to say it. 
[01:35:00]  But I was still able to talk.  But that's another thing where you kind of, you can't enjoy a blowjob because you're just  thinking, all right, how long could she possibly stay down there?  And then you feel guilty, so you've got to kind of push your hips up.  You're grabbing the edge of the pool.  And now you're doing calisthenics.  You can't enjoy the blowjob in the pool.  Well, you're just going to trust her.  If she fucking passes out from sucking your cock on the wall, she's an idiot.  All of a sudden just goes limp on your dick and does the dead man's float. 
[01:35:30]  You finish off in her ass.  Then I have to explain to her family why you fucked their dead daughter instead of calling  911.  Did they even drown?  She just choked on one of your dingleberries.  Oh, God damn.  Hey, shit.  Fuck, Bobby.  I'd love to.  We spent too much time in fucking Montreal.  Footer's going to help me out.  We're not even talking to Bobby about something.  Go ahead, Footer. 
[01:36:00]  Hey, two quick things.  One is the yoga pants is definitely the fucking hottest apparel item.  Yeah, I agree.  A yoga pants show.  You know what?  What's the workout pants?  It might be the yoga pants where the top is now looks like lingerie.  That shit rocks.  And very tight around the pussy and ass so you can see like the view.  That's the regular yoga pants, but now they're making it where that top inch looks like it's  like lingerie or panties popping out.  Give me the front view, Dan, if you could find one of the yoga pant. 
[01:36:30]  Footer, go ahead.  The key with the yoga pant is that you can kind of see like Jimmy likes that fat pussy from  beyond.  You can kind of see it snug with that pussy real nice.  Yeah, yeah.  Give me that one there, Danny.  Get the ones.  Look at Spanx.  Is there a girl out there that can help us out?  Hold on.  One of the pants where the lingerie, it looks like lingerie at the top, but that is the  new look now that we're talking.  Yeah, yeah.  That's fucking smoking.  Get out of here.  That is wall with you.  Look at that.  I like a pair of dungarees.  Dungarees? 
[01:37:00]  Footer, what else you got, brother?  Tough skins.  Real quick.  Hey, Bobby.  You did a great job on Louie, man.  That scene with you in the diner.  You were fucking great.  Yeah, I can't believe we're not talking about it.  Bobby had a huge scene with Louis C.K. and his new show, Louie, on FX.  Yeah.  All right.  And I went to the premiere with Bobby.  It was a good time.  Who came up to us and said, wow, your acting was great?  I'm just the fucking owner of FX.  And I suck.  I just blew him off like an O&A fan.  I was like, yeah, thanks, kid.  And then he goes up.  Right after saying that to me, he goes up. 
[01:37:30]  He goes, we'd like to introduce you to the fucking owner.  And he just, hi, how are you?  It's the same guy.  I'm like, fuck me.  That's my Chris.  Sucks.  And the Eddie Trunk lookalike also came up to you from Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Yeah, yeah.  Jeff Garland.  Huh?  Jeff Garland.  Jeff Garland loved your acting.  He came right up to you like, holy shit.  He goes, man, you could act.  Yeah, well, Louie's actually a good director.  He actually will fucking let you just, he'll stop and be like, look, dude, just do this 
[01:38:00]  or try this and let you do it as many times as you possibly can.  He just does it, does it, does it, and he gets it.  And as soon as he gets it, he just says, we're done.  I'm out.  And you're playing his brother.  So you're going to be on a few episodes, right?  I got one more episode where we found out.  Don't give it away.  Some shit.  I'm in the whole episode, I think, though.  It was really fun to do.  It was, you know, it was so funny.  I was working with a, he told me that just the lady that we're doing the scene with our 
[01:38:30]  mother is a Tony Award winning actress.  So I'm fucking, you know, I'm paranoid.  Of course.  I'm fucking paranoid.  I rehearse so hard because I want to know every fucking line and I want her to be like,  hey, you're good.  And we get there.  This fucking bitch doesn't know one line.  One line.  She's like, uh, we, two seconds in, uh, uh, uh, what's the line?  Don't do the, I'm like, you fucking, fucking worked.  I knew every, I could have fucking, we could have been done in two seconds. 
[01:39:00]  Four hours later.  Ah, and that happens on everything.  Every law and order I've been on, they know nothing.  Once you get the gig, they could give a fuck.  They could give a fuck.  They go, they go like this, this literally on their blackberries on law and order until  they go action.  And then they literally just stand up and say their fucking two lines.  So where do you think he is now?  Cut.  And they sit back down, get back on the blackberries to figure out the next line.  Yeah.  But Louie's show is fucking good.  This episode coming up is, I hope comes off funny because it was a lot of crazy shit. 
[01:39:30]  What, what was last week's episode?  Cause I got to see the first four.  So I'm caught up.  Last week was yet, right?  Last week was him and Pam.  Remember?  Yeah, Pam.  From Lucky Louie.  Yeah, that was actually.  All right, so I got to start watching again.  It's a good, it's a good, it was a good episode.  It's just a fucking interesting show, man.  You just, like, you don't, it goes where you don't think it's going to fucking go.  I love the show.  Yeah.  There's nothing on TV like it.  I wish it was longer. 
[01:40:00]  That's the only thing.  I wish it was a full half hour instead of the 22 minutes it is.  That's what a half hour is on TV.  Yeah, but on HBO, if it was on HBO, it could be a full half.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  You need that extra eight minutes.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, cause it's like every, I mean, it's probably good, but every week you're like, fuck.  Just give me fucking three more minutes of shit.  That's a sign of a good show.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  I feel the same way about Psych.  What?  It's one of my favorite shows, Psych on USA.  I've never heard of it. 
[01:40:30]  It's a modern Chevy Chase.  Oh, okay.  It's a fucking great show.  It's one of the funniest shows on TV.  A better time somebody calls him, he goes, Psych, and he goes, what?  And he goes, I'm just kidding.  I hate Chip.  I hate Chip in America, and I hate Chip in Canada.  I hate Canadian Chip almost more than I hate fucking theory.  Canadian Chip is the worst.  There was a Canadian Chip?  There was a Canadian Chip, and I fucking hated him.  He was the worst.  And the only one I do like is, what's his name? 
[01:41:00]  I don't know.  Edgar?  No, not Edgar.  Uncle Paul?  No, Uncle Paul was up there, too.  I forget his name.  There's a new one.  Who's the one with the dry teeth?  Edgar.  Oh, that's Edgar.  I don't like him.  Edgar's brother?  Eugene.  Eugene.  Jimmy's psychotic.  My chick hates Eugene.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Eugene is an asshole.  Because he touches with his nails.  Because he doesn't touch with his fingers. 
[01:41:30]  I don't like that either.  It doesn't hurt, though.  It doesn't hurt, but it's gross.  But it's touching with the nails?  Don't fucking bore me.  I don't like him either.  I don't know how he's...  Oh, my God.  What's his name?  What's the other guy's name?  I don't know what you mean.  I don't either.  There's a new one that I love.  I love.  I just want to adopt him.  Maybe it wasn't Jimmy.  No, it was...  Some guy you met in a hotel.  Yeah.  Problem?  I forget his name.  No.  Goddamn fucking Danny. 
[01:42:00]  It's got a whole goddamn...  Yeah, but we still haven't found those...  The one of, like, yoga pants and asses and...  I love that with a crack in there.  Travis linked it to me.  It's just girls...  Those are my favorite.  These...  What are those called?  Those shiny fucking silky Joan Jett ones.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that rump.  They're a fucking...  Wow.  What is this?  It's called girlsinyogapants.com.  What?  Oh, my God.  Look at the ones leaning on top of the other one as if she's teaching her to play pool.  Yes.  Is that a yoga position? 
[01:42:30]  My dick just burped.  So...  Wow.  Oh, wait.  That's a hiney.  Look at the...  I love one that you...  No, that's a fucking piece of shit.  That's a great ass.  That's a great ass.  No, it is not.  What's wrong with you?  Go back.  What's wrong with you?  Look at the way...  Look at the top.  What?  It's muffin top fucking...  Who fucking cares?  What the fuck?  That's a fat chick's ass, dude.  You can't see her spine that's fucking grossing you out?  Her ass is amazing, dude.  Hey, what was that other website, I think, that you were tweeting about?  Yes.  Rentboy.  Oh.  Just gonna...  Rentboy. 
[01:43:00]  What is it?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, that looks amazing.  Look at her pussy hanging out from the pants.  And she's looking back over her shoulder like, hey, who's there?  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus Christ.  Oh, video, video, video, video.  I am going to look right now and find a wonderful sight.  Camera and a mirror or something like that?  Girls and a mirror.  I'm punching it up right now so I can get it.  As Danny looks at floor bumping, which is girls that are doing splits and then making  their asses move. 
[01:43:30]  I don't like when an ass moves like a heart.  I don't like that either.  I like it.  One cheek is fucking a ventricle and one's an oracle atrium.  It shouldn't make you mad.  I don't like it.  What's wrong with you?  I'm upset.  It's not like Jimmy said yesterday.  It's not lima beans.  I'm angry.  Shouldn't get you angry.  Wouldn't mind sticking my eyes.  Is that website gone?  I shouldn't have said anything.  Oh.  Ah, you crashed it?  Yep.  They don't have enough bandwidth.  Why are you getting mad?  I know.  You're getting mad at fat asses.  I'm always getting angry. 
[01:44:00]  Ah, here it is.  Get all I fucking hate you.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Punch it up first.  Yeah, punch it up first so these guys can enjoy and then we'll give it to everybody else  that, you know, that's why you guys got to follow us on Twitter, man.  Yeah, because we just crashed our girls on yogapass.com.  There's a whole other show happening on Twitter after this ends.  But for the people that aren't following us on Twitter, we'll give you the website in a second.  This is easy.  It's, uh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  You know what I think is sexy though?  Those tube tops, it's just an elastic that goes over the tits. 
[01:44:30]  I like that.  It squishes the boobs.  I can't be around it.  It's a weird form.  I can't be around it.  I have the urge every time I see one to grab it with one hand and rip it down just for a  fucking tits will flop out.  I'm an uncontrollable urge.  No joke.  Like, I have to walk away from women wearing tube tops.  Even my wife.  If my wife's out in public with a tube top, I want to just rip her tits out.  We've talked about the perv switch, where some guys, like dentists and things,  they rip these girls' clothes off as they're under anesthesia, 
[01:45:00]  because the perv switch just clicks, and it's over on it.  I go through that sometimes on a daily basis, where I will look and think,  oh, my God, did you see that picture?  And I will think, I want to just rip that girl's pants down  and shove my finger in her asshole.  Like, I'm just going, I could do that.  Like, I could do it.  There's going to be repercussions.  And I understand there will be repercussions.  But right now, I could just rip her pants down and shove my finger in her ass. 
[01:45:30]  What do you think she's going to do, stand there while you put your finger between her stiff cheeks?  I would get a piece of it in there, though.  What if she turned around and was like, oh, and she started making out with you?  I'd be disgusted.  I'd be a fucking whore.  Pull your pants up.  And you'd throw her in your trunk, take her back to the compound, and fuck her head.  Oh, it'd be great.  Bobby, do you like this site?  This site is so good.  We're not going to give it away yet.  This site is called, let me crash it.  It's girlcamramirror.tumblr.com. 
[01:46:00]  Why don't you give it to him?  Why don't you make him work for it?  Why don't you say double and just...  I already tweeted it.  Don't say .com.  Make him put org.  Some guy gave it to me.  This is every chick that fucking snapped pictures of themselves to give to their boyfriend or something.  Oh.  And it somehow got out.  And they are smoking!  Wow.  That's bad for your health.  Smoking.  Not smoking, Chip.  How do you spell Tumblr?  It's T-U-M-B-L-R. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, it is?  .com.  Oh, that'll fucking hold him for a while.  Oh, look at that rum.  Look at the...  Like...  And they're making these cool faces.  They're regular girls.  Giant tits.  Fucking just...  Little boy shorts.  Look at that.  That's a regular girl.  She just got her pussy fucking...  Pussy fat showing.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  People don't have...  Yay.  These are real, though.  These aren't fucking Russian broads. 
[01:47:00]  No, no, no.  They're not.  That's just it.  These are real girls.  Look at this chick.  Look at that.  Look at this one.  Oh, my God.  Why are you screaming?  Ugh.  What the fuck?  I can't help but scream when I see these beautiful nude looking for them.  Are you shitting out old wood?  Jimmy just showed Bobby a picture of his shit.  He looks...  His shit looks like a shipwreck underneath the World Trade Center.  These pictures, though, are just girls taking nudes and semi-nude pictures of themselves 
[01:47:30]  in a mirror.  And this guy fucking posted it on Twitter and said, Anthony, I think you'd like this.  And man, was he right.  And then I retweeted it.  And people were just...  Wow, that's it right there.  ...saying hours they spent.  Hours on this site.  How poor the girls are, because she has, like, a film camera.  She had to go to photo of Matt.  And hope the guy didn't fucking...  Didn't fucking steal the...  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Give me a break.  I like those tits. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, who wouldn't?  Jesus H.  Jesus H.  That's nice.  She's the type of ass cheeks that don't meet.  Like, the asshole's always open.  Are you ready for a good rogering?  Rocco Sucks is saying Ant is a creep.  Let me tell you something.  I'm not denying it.  Well, we know you're a creep, but not for this.  For this?  Not for this.  Look at this site, you fucking homo.  You fucking queer.  I'm not you, Jimmy.  Not you.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, yeah, Jimmy.  No, I wasn't fucking you.  Anthony, if people go to OP Radio on Twitter, I got the website up for everybody. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, you fucking faggot.  What?  You want more fucking goddamn viewers, motherfucker.  Look at her wearing her fucking...  Oh, leg warmers?  Leg warmers.  How fucking hot is that?  I tweeted the website, because people got confused.  There ain't one tit or pussy in that picture, by the way.  And she looks fucking hot.  I was just trying to help him out.  That's all, Bobby.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that's a great site.  Jesus.  Actually, Ant gets the credit first.  Anthony, Anthony, Cole.  And I, I, I, you look at it, look at what I do now. 
[01:49:00]  Look what Anthony does now.  What?  Jerks off to these pictures.  Ban-a-bam-bam.  Ban-a-bam.  Credit goes to Starter4343.  That's his name.  Starter4343 is the guy that turned me onto this site.  And let me tell you something.  I would become friends with him.  Hey, one of these things is not like the others.  Yeah.  All right.  That was the first bad fucking one you killed.  The first lemon in the bunch. 
[01:49:30]  Listen, her tits look like a fucking, like a fucking sleepy guy's eyes.  Let's go back to fireworks.  I mean, there's going to be a few duds, but in general, you're going to have some fine  fucking fireworks.  That's awful.  Why is that awful?  Because look at her fucking pussy look.  It's like not done.  It really is.  Tiny pussy.  It's not done.  Yeah.  It's just, yeah, I'm sure Bobby would say get the fuck out of here.  It's like a premature pussy.  Nothing worse than a pussy that's not done.  That's kind of funny, man.  That's kind of funny.  Look at this broad.  Hold on.  Go back up.  She looks like me. 
[01:50:00]  She looks like a girl next door.  If you're in a fucking metal band.  Look at that.  That's girl next door shit.  It's great.  Yeah, if you live next door to a fucking ugly town.  Live next door to a junior high school.  There you go.  Better.  Look at that.  Can you find the one where someone said, can you find the one that someone said looks  like me if I was a tranny?  Was that the one with the red hair?  That was just, no, I think it was, this goes back a while.  Dude, there are hundreds and hundreds of these girls taking pictures in mirrors of themselves. 
[01:50:30]  Oh.  Look at that, right?  Come on.  Ah, there you go right there.  A little cute Filipino.  Yeah.  With a pink tongue.  That's just, that's Chelsea.  That's a regular chick.  Chelsea Clinton.  Look at that.  Look at that bitch.  That bitch.  Look at those big heavy boobs.  Big heavy tits and big hips.  Yeah.  Oh, she just got out of the shower a little foggy.  There's another one of Spanish descent, it looks like.  There's a girl that looks like.  Fucking Anna Paquin.  Anna Paquin with giant fucking tits. 
[01:51:00]  What a great sight, though.  I think you're getting close to.  Oh, wow.  What's the next one?  Oh, this girl, she couldn't fuck it.  She put the mirror on the floor so she could spread eagle herself.  Keep going.  I think we're getting close to the tranny pic.  Yeah, tranny pic.  The one that looks like me if I was a tranny.  Wow, this side's got some bandwidth.  Oh, that's fucking gross.  Yeah, we're getting close.  I remember this whole string of pictures.  That's gross.  That's nice.  There's me.  The next one.  There's me.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Wow. 
[01:51:30]  Go fuck yourself.  Oh, my God.  I would fuck the shit out of you.  Go fuck yourself.  Dude, I would suck your cock in a jacuzzi.  Piece of shit.  Whoever came up with that one on Twitter, go fuck yourself.  You got to save that Opie tranny picture.  That is really useful.  Get the fuck out of you.  Oh, my God.  That's you as a big-titted, fuckable girl.  Look at the horrible hair.  I'd fucking walk you home every day.  I'd fuck Opie tranny.  Oh, wow.  Look at Opie tranny.  Opie tranny has a nice fucking pussy bulge.  That is a big bulge.  I don't think it's a pussy bulge. 
[01:52:00]  And a little V.  Yeah, it might not be a pussy.  You never had a V, you fuck.  You fuck.  Yeah, fuck.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Look at those nipples.  Look at the size of her pussy.  It's ugly Betty.  It is.  Fucking ugly twat.  I thought you were going to say ugly Bobby.  The best thing about this site is the variety.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, look at her.  What's wrong with you, dude? 
[01:52:30]  What's wrong with you?  Look at her.  She's wearing the hat that fucking...  Boo!  She's Asian, boo!  White girl, yay!  Yay!  Fucking crack at her, white girl.  Nice abs.  Jesus Christ.  I don't like fucking 0% body fat.  I'd have nothing in common with her.  Oh, she has a new iPhone.  This was recent.  What aren't you doing?  I'll just sit here and pinch my man tits.  That's a very recent photo.  The new iPhone.  There's the old 3G.  Oh, man.  Look at this.  This is a great site.  Hey, well, you can't jack to this, though.  You can, too.  No, you can't.  No, this is jackable. 
[01:53:00]  If you do the quick, hard, okay jerk-off.  You ever jerk-off?  It's the okay.  You know when you do the A-okay sign where you just take your thumb and point your finger?  And you rub the head?  And you just...  I'm not even talking rubbing.  I'm talking just grip and rip.  Like, you're fucking...  It's just moving the skin.  No fucking...  No this.  It's this.  Like, you're fucking...  Angry jerking off.  That's for the fast one. 
[01:53:30]  Like, I gotta get this out of me.  When was the last time you used cream to jerk-off?  Oh, fucking long time.  Have you ever jerk-off so hard that your ankles and back lift up off the bed like a V?  Like a George Foreman punch?  That's cartoon jerks.  It's like when Bugs Bunny pulled himself out of the hat.  That's impossible.  It's like you're just...  It's like you're pulling some string that's connected from your spine to your heels.  It's the way Chris Angel jerks off. 
[01:54:00]  Levitating jack.  You look like a boomerang.  People are picking their favorites.  Could we go to...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Could we go to...  Man, people...  Fuck, I lost it.  Right there, right there, right there, right there.  That's fucking cute right there.  Ooh, she's hot too with that.  I'm kind of getting back into the big bush.  Thank you, Bob Kelly.  I've been talking about...  Not the big, giant, 70s bush.  Now, calm the fuck down, people.  I'm talking about a well-coiffed... 
[01:54:30]  Bush.  But natural-shaped triangle.  Yeah, woman's bush.  That when they take the panties off and you see, like, hair, you're like...  It reminds you of, like, when you were growing...  I mean, sorry, sorry.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go back one.  Go back one.  Look, look.  Look at the hair.  Yeah, I like that.  You know why?  Because they take the panties down and you're like...  That reminds me of when I, like, first got fucked.  Yeah.  It was a chick with a bush.  It was back in the fucking, like, 70s, early 80s. 
[01:55:00]  You fucking girls with hairy pussies.  Yeah.  Like, that's good.  I like the bush.  I like a nice hair on the pussy.  Not like back in the day when...  Remember, if you watch pornos back in the day, like, women have hair on their assholes,  like, guys, I didn't know that until back in the day when they didn't shave that.  And you look and the hair goes from their, like, belly button, like, all the way to their  fucking asshole.  It surrounds them.  It's just...  Like, they're sitting on a mink. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is bad.  Like, girls shave their assholes.  Like, they wax...  They're waxing that shit.  They'll wax their assholes.  They're waxing their asses down.  Yeah.  Like, if they...  Like, some...  Like, I almost want to let my wife, hey, don't shave for, like, four...  I just want to see what you've got.  See what you've got.  I want to see where the hair comes back.  See what's going on.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Like, if my wife just had just a fucking toupee in her asshole...  A toupee!  A fucking divot.  A toupee's blown in her ass.  Holy shit! 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  Look at the ass and legs on that fucking blonde.  That is astounding.  Outstanding!  I can't fuck girls like that, dude.  I come too quick.  I can't.  I got nothing.  I need a chick with a goofy face.  I need a chick with a hot body but looks like David Letterman.  Yeah.  What about her?  Look at her.  She's a little goofy.  Yeah, a goofy face with a smoking body, I can deal with.  She's fucking...  That girl right there is cute.  She's got, like, this reddish hair.  She's kind of goofy looking but cute, goofy, and she's got a smoking body. 
[01:56:30]  She's never worked out in a day in her life.  Look at her shoulders.  She's got one need to.  Not one ounce of muscle on her.  Nothing.  That's all right.  I like it.  No, I like that.  She's hiding her vagina like teehee.  Teehee.  Nothing to see here.  These are all winners, man.  Can you just post your own picture up there?  Yay!  Well...  Because I would love to...  What, you?  You mean personally you?  Oh, what is that?  Ugh, zombie.  Boo!  That one sucked.  Boo!  Turn up the contract.  How many dogs in this thing?  Look at that mope.  She was fucking forced into doing it. 
[01:57:00]  Just send me a photo.  I don't want to.  Just send later.  Look at that.  Look at that.  That does nothing for me.  Dumb white ass tan line thing where she wears a bikini that's much too big on her ass.  That chick looks hot.  Look at this.  She's doing a little suicide girl pucker of the lips.  There you go.  Great tits on that girl.  She's got the little glasses on.  Look at that.  She just got done with her homework.  Messy.  She has a messy room and a collage she made.  I was about to say, anytime there's a chick with a collage on the wall.  A collage! 
[01:57:30]  You should probably get away from that website immediately.  Delete photo.  Delete photo.  What is it?  Oh, that's fantastic shit right there.  Wow.  A Selena Gomez poster in the background.  That's not a good sign.  Oh, God.  It's fantastic.  Team Selena?  Oh, Jesus.  Bobby, Team Selena?  Who the fuck is Selena?  Oh, fuck.  Bye, guys.  Come on.  Where have you been?  Yeah, I got to fly.  Where have you been?  What?  I was in Montreal.  Where are you doing?  I got to go to Michelle.  I'll see you Monday.  Have fun in Montreal.  I will.  Make sure your wings don't get tired. 
[01:58:00]  I got to leave early because I got no bird wings, you know.  All right, Jimmy.  Have a good one.  From New York.  Jim Norton, everyone.  My arms hurt.  Hey, Chip.  That's a pretty good one.  That's Selena Gomez, Bobby.  Have fun.  Oh, safe flight, Jimmy.  What's up with her?  If I'm killed, it's been fun.  Shut up.  Jesus.  Don't say that.  God forbid.  God forbid.  Hope you get stopped for being a rippist.  Wouldn't that be great?  RIP!  RIP!  Look at that girl.  If they don't let any of Patrice's friends in either?  That's not the greatest Selena Gomez picture, by the way. 
[01:58:30]  That's not the greatest, but you know what?  You can see how fucking amazing.  She's way hotter than that stupid Miley Cyrus.  Was she the one that was in here?  You think Miley Cyrus is hotter than Selena Gomez?  Was Selena Gomez in here?  Was she in here?  Yes, she was up here in the building.  When I went to the elevator a couple weeks ago, she was standing outside the elevator,  and she looked fucking amazing.  Well, I'm not saying that she's not hot, but I wasn't on the whole Miley Cyrus train.  Miley Cyrus is starting to talk more and more like a man every year.  I don't listen to what she's saying.  I don't even know what the fuck she sounds like. 
[01:59:00]  You think Miley Cyrus is cute?  Oh, very much so.  She reminds me of fucking Linda Blair while she was the devil.  She has that stroke, the teeth where the gums are too high.  She does have a weird smile thing going on, but Miley Cyrus' body is really good.  Her mouth doesn't shut.  But that's the goofy factor that'll keep you from coming too quick, bummer.  It's not goofy. 
[01:59:30]  It's fucking grosses me out.  Oh, Danny's getting mad now because he's clicking on pictures, and they're bringing them to the sites.  Don't you hate that?  You click on a picture that you want to see, and it takes you to the nudity site.  You've got to pay.  I don't want to go to the site.  I want to go to the site.  I want to see that.  Look at that.  Are there naked pictures of this girl?  Oh, I know.  Look.  She does nothing for me.  What's your problem?  Nothing for me.  What's the matter?  No cock?  What's wrong with you?  No, she's not ugly, but Selena Gomez is great.  Go right there.  Stop.  Go back.  Go back.  Go back.  She's forcing her. 
[02:00:00]  Look, she can't close her mouth to save her life.  She's always showing teeth.  What's the problem with that?  She's got fucking wax teeth in from Halloween.  Where is the other one?  Right there.  Right there.  It's not like a fucking Gary Busey.  No, no, no, no, no.  She's got fucking teeth.  Look at that fucking teeth.  Look at those fucking chompers.  But who cares?  Ugh.  They look fake.  What are you going to do?  They look like you wind them up, and you fucking let them run across the fucking desk at an office.  What are you going to make out in the car?  What the fuck do you care? 
[02:00:30]  You're dogging her in that ass.  Look at her.  I'd rather fuck her father.  Billy Ray.  Grab him by his mullet.  Grab him by his mullet and his fucking highlights.  She's actually looking all sexy next to her father.  That's just wrong.  There's a creepy relationship there.  It's so wrong that I'm going to take my cock out.  Or so it seems.  And break the microphone.  Can we go to break now?  Break.  We're going to break.  Break.  What?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  Hey, you want to play a Mel Gibson remix going into a break?  Who doesn't love?  Okay, now, Bobby, what do you think? 
[02:01:00]  It's a problem.  I'll tell you, it's a problem.  Yeah, because that thing is going to be a fucking disaster.  Thank you.  It's going to.  Every girl.  It's starting to happen.  That's not true.  Every girl's going to be a disaster at some point in their life.  Oh, yeah.  75 years old.  You're going to fucking, you know, bang a girl.  Did you say 75?  Yes.  Yeah, everybody.  Come on.  I said everyone turned into a disaster.  I'm talking right now.  That's fucking gross.  Look at that ass.  It's deformed.  It's deformed.  All right, Bobby, you lost me now.  Go back.  Go back.  That picture was really good.  Go back.  Out of your mind. 
[02:01:30]  This right here, her fuck, there's...  She's taking a weird step there.  I'll tell you.  She's taking a weird step.  All right, maybe it's a weird step.  Ass like a Thai boy right there.  It's great, man.  All right, now you got me.  I'm back in.  I'm back in.  You're back on board.  Now it's a little weird.  What's wrong?  You know how to fucking get to a man's heart, don't you?  No Gibson remixes.  Which one do you want to play?  Which one do you want to play?  Oh, Christ.  Which one do you like?  Which one do you like?  There's so many that I really enjoy.  We got the Burn It Down the House thing. 
[02:02:00]  We got the Double Rainbow.  We got the Pat O'Brien.  I like Burn It Down the House.  Let's do that.  It's one of my favorite D-Boy remixes.  Supposedly another tape is going to be released within moments.  You're going to be here for the next Mel Gibson tape when it's released, Bobby.  I'm excited.  We've been right on top of this, by the way, playing it in its entirety.  No beeps, and right when they're released.  We're your Mel Gibson show.  I'll tell you what.  No one is doing a better job at the Mel Gibson tapes than we are.  Yes, Bobby.  I was telling Jimmy on his show, we were talking about it on his show on Raw Dog. 
[02:02:30]  I don't know if you heard it.  But I had the same fucking argument with my wife on a fucking mountain in New Hampshire.  I said the same exact.  Instead of a pack of fucking Negroes, I had a pack of rednecks, pillbillies.  I called her a cunt 19 times.  I told her, I hope she slipped and fucking smashed her head on a rock.  I hope a fucking bear ate her fucking entrails.  And it was all because she wasn't using the stick correctly.  Walking up the hill that I gave her.  A walking stick?  Yeah. 
[02:03:00]  What is this?  Randy Taylor, the Jimmy Dean sausage guy.  I'll smell good.  Is it good?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Jimmy Dean sausage guy.  All right, now we've got to do two going into break.  We're going to do...  Let's do the burning down the house because we fucking promoted it.  And then just stay right where you are.  We're not going into break.  We're going to do Derek's latest fucking Mel Gibson remix with the Jimmy Dean sausage guys.  Sausage.  I said I'm fucking walking you up and said blow me. 
[02:03:30]  Fucking blow me, bitch.  Blow me first.  I deserve to be blown first.  Before the fucking jacuzzi.  I said I'll burn the goddamn house out.  But blow me first.  Blow me.  You're a pain in my ass. 
[02:04:00]  Stop saying that.  Don't follow me.  You're a pain in my ass.  Wow.  All right.  Very good job with that.  We're back live. 
[02:04:30]  Too much going on.  Sorry.  All right.  We're going to do the Derek thing?  I'm distracted because now people are trying to turn us on to all sorts of websites.  These are just, well, they are indeed awesome tits.  These are like Irish girl tits.  Never seen an ounce of sun.  They've been grown in hazy clouds.  They really are.  They look like when a baker puts dough to rise.  I've never been with a girl where it's tough to see where the nipple is because it's so fucking light. 
[02:05:00]  Wow.  That's old school.  You have to bite it so it shows up a little bit.  Jesus Christ.  Bobby.  Look at that.  That's old school right there.  Those are old school titties.  There you go.  There you fucking go.  That's a good sight, too, man.  There you fucking go.  Hey, uh, we got the, uh, this is called what?  Awesome tits dot Tumblr?  Yeah.  Someone needs fucking credit on Twitter.  There's nothing wrong with that. 
[02:05:30]  What happened?  What's wrong?  You wouldn't take a fucking bull job from her?  If you were delivering a sub and you showed up and she was like, hey, thanks.  And then she, hey, I'm going to suck your cock.  You wouldn't let her suck your cock and suck on her titties?  It doesn't belong on this.  What?  When I worked at D'Angelo's, I used to fucking deliver a ham and cheese with pickles and mustard  twice a week to a chick like that.  And she'd suck my cock in her living room.  Oh.  And when the order came in, did you get all excited?  Like, yes, it's going down today.  The first couple times, but after that, I was like, fuck this dirty old bitch.  Give it a sub and a sandwich. 
[02:06:00]  You fucking you.  I want to thank R, the number one R-A-C-R for this fine website we're checking out right  now.  Here's Derek's latest remix, Anthony.  Brand new.  Debuting it.  Oh.  Mel Gibson versus the sausage guy.  The Jimmy Dean sausage guy.  As we go to break.  Nice.  I don't know where you people come from.  I don't know if you test your products, your quantity of your product.  Your products are very delicious. 
[02:06:30]  Love your sausage for 30 something years.  But I can't take and feed a family of five on a little 12 ounce roll of sausage.  What?  I ruined your life.  How did I ruin your life?  How did I ruin your life?  I don't mind paying you more money for your 16 ounce roll of sausage, but you don't have  it anymore.  You've got a 12 ounce roll.  It's real clear.  That was so easy.  The minute I pulled the plug, you're out of here.  And you've got three men that weigh over 200 pounds of beef.  Look at yourself.  Look at your son. 
[02:07:00]  He's a fucking mess.  A woman that's a little plump and a daughter who's 13 and you're going to try to take a  12 ounce roll of sausage and a couple of dozen eggs and feed that.  It ain't going to work.  Stop beating the ass.  Stop beating that.  And I'm not going to purchase your product anymore or ever again.  What the fuck do you hope to accomplish with that?  What are you hoping to accomplish with that?  What, are you going to pay me back?  Never mind.  What the fuck were you going to say?  And as far as your 16 ounce and maple and sage, I don't eat that. 
[02:07:30]  I'm not from the North.  I'm a Texas man.  All right.  Jimmy Dean sausage is for Southern people to eat with the breakfast with the fried eggs  and the T-bone steak.  You fucking offend me and you don't care about anyone but yourself.  And I'm not going to buy two of those 12 ounce packages just because you want to downsize  and charge the same goddamn price.  I was trying to stir your goddamn feelings.  I'd sure like you to go back to your 16 ounce package on your regular sausage. 
[02:08:00]  I can't believe you asked for that.  Because I'm not going to buy it.  Otherwise, ever again, I'll just have my own damn sausage made like I used to 30 something  years ago.  It's not as tasty as yours is, but it'll work.  If you do that, it's over.  How dare you act like such a bitch?  Goodbye.  Least drunk bitch.  Go figure.  Turn whore.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show on the Fire and Sirius XM. 
[02:08:30]  Hanging with Bobby Kelly today.  Robert Kelly.  Bob, what do you got going on?  Anything we're supposed to be promoting?  Yeah, I'm going to Philadelphia.  The Helium Comedy Club is coming up July 29th, 30th, and 31st.  All right, we got two weeks.  Two weeks out, right?  Two weeks out.  Get tickets now.  We're available at heliumcomedy.com.  And pack up the Thursday and Friday show.  I think that's the only day I get bonuses.  You and my boys are going to need tickets. 
[02:09:00]  You know that.  Yeah, of course.  Three of the guys want to go to see Bobby Kelly.  Robert Kelly, Bobby Kelly.  I don't give a shit.  All right, good.  I have 17,000 fans, and that's where I top off on everything.  That's all I have.  That's it?  That's it.  I look at other people's, like, your fan base, and you guys are in the 30s and shit.  I'm between 15 and 18, and I'm done.  That's how many fans I have in the world.  Can't squeak out another 500.  Can't squeak it out now.  So out of all the people that listen to you guys, maybe 14,000 of them like me. 
[02:09:30]  The other half think I'm a douchebag.  That's pretty good odds.  It's not bad.  I'll fucking take it.  I'll take that every time.  I'll take it.  I'll take that every fucking time.  Hey, listen, speaking of Philly, there's a great story.  I don't know.  I can't give everyone fucking credit, but someone just tweeted a great story coming out of Philly.  Oral sex causes crash, but the woman claimed a carjacking.  Oh, so she was giving him a handy? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have read the headline, because that's the punchline, unfortunately.  I fucked it up.  But Vinland, it's still a good story.  Vinland police say a New Jersey woman filed a false report that she was carjacked at gunpoint.  She also claimed that she broke her arm during the incident, okay?  Broke her arm.  This is everything she was claiming to the cops.  The real story, the truth, 23-year-old Sarah.  How do you say it?  How do you pronounce B-L-A-S-S-E?  Blasey.  Blasey? 
[02:10:30]  Blasey.  Sarah Blasey was performing a sexual act on an unidentified man.  So she's driving, well, he's driving, obviously, and she's fucking blowing him.  Yeah.  On an unidentified man when her...  Yeah.  Remember Garp?  Yeah.  Garp.  Uh, when her SUV crashed into a tree.  Wow.  Uh, she then, ready for this, because she needed to cover this shit up?  Yeah.  So she crashes into a tree.  Uh, she then set her car on fire. 
[02:11:00]  Good, good alibi there.  That's great.  Okay.  Police were called to South Jersey Healthcare Medical Center early Saturday morning when  Blasey, or Sarah, was being treated for a broken arm.  There, she said that she was returning from a friend's house when she stopped and asked  a man for directions.  Holy shit, this gets better.  For erections?  She went on to explain...  Erections?  ...on to explain that man pulled out a gun, threw her out of the car, and drove away. 
[02:11:30]  After further questioning, Sarah admitted that she had picked up a man, moved to the passenger's  seat, and was performing oral sex at the time of the crash.  Oh, boy.  She must give a good BJ if the guy's fucking...  Yeah, the guy freaked out.  ...swerving into a tree.  Missed the fucking brake, hit the gas pedal, his legs were flying around like an infant.  He was coming, he just locked up, his legs shot out like a fucking arrow.  To cover up the accident, uh, she set her car on fire.  And she refuses to identify the, uh, the guy. 
[02:12:00]  The dick in question?  The dick in question.  Very good, yeah.  So that's a terrific story coming out of Philly.  Fucking, they're showing their nipples.  We're on chat roulette.  Chat roulette?  You like chat roulette?  Dude, chat roulette on the iPhone is the most addictive, crazy...  I'm getting it.  I gotta get that.  I can't fucking stop.  I actually, my wife was sleeping, I turned it on in the house and I just, I showed her 
[02:12:30]  and every guy would stop.  She's just sleeping in bed.  Every guy would stop and like watch and then it would just turn to me and I'd be like,  ha ha, you fucking creep.  Me and Norton turned it on in Montreal.  Montreal.  Montreal.  Montreal.  Montreal.  Montreal.  And it was just a chick sucking a cock.  Wow.  How great is that?  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's good.  You wouldn't have liked it because the cock was a little dark.  Ah.  Yeah.  Boo.  Come on.  Boo. 
[02:13:00]  Come on.  It was nice though.  It looked like a, it was a black guy's dick but it looked like a white guy's cock.  It had the shape of a white guy's cock.  It wasn't all big and veiny.  It was kind of mediocre.  Don't, you really looked at it that much?  Yes, Anthony.  That much?  Yes, I did.  You had it, yeah.  I have, guys.  Yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  Yes, I absolutely did.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice cock.  Nice cock.  It doesn't take long to get to a jerker, man.  Let me tell you, this is the most, this is the craziest technology ever and somebody, 
[02:13:30]  it's already to fucking just do it with cocks.  It always has gotten to that point.  This fucking technology has just exploded in the last, what, two years maybe?  It's gotten insane.  You were talking about that app with the billboards.  I know we're going with the chat roulette, but you've got to explain that one too.  Oh, the app, it's code.  It's all this fucked up code.  I forget, it's QR code or some shit, and billboards in New York City now, it's just code, and you  need the app to see them.  So you have the app on your phone, and you see that billboard, like Calvin Klein has one, 
[02:14:00]  and you can click on it, and it shows you what the picture is.  What it's supposed to be.  What it's supposed to be.  But does it at least say Calvin Klein, so they're getting their promotion?  You know what I mean?  It says Calvin Klein on top, and then it's just code.  And then it's code.  And then you need the app.  And it makes you want to get the app so you can see what the picture is.  And Danny said it's like they live with the glasses.  It's like when you look at the billboard and see, you know, reproduce.  Marry.  Marry.  Eat.  Sleep. 
[02:14:30]  This is your God.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm dancing right now, and this old guy actually likes it.  He's staying on right now.  Danny's squeezing Bobby's boobies.  Can you put it over here so we can see it?  Oh, it's on your iPhone?  Yeah, it's on my iPhone.  I thought you were doing that.  Oh, there's an old lady.  There's an old...  Hi.  Show your cock.  Show your cock.  My cock's in repair right now.  I went to the cock doctor.  I had to get my cock fixed.  What happened?  I had a little thing on it.  What the...  Oh, no.  Did you have fucking genital warts, you motherfucker?  No. 
[02:15:00]  Stop looking.  Did you get fucking ass?  What happened to your penis?  Come on.  Get in here.  What happened to your cock?  What happened to your penis?  You know, it was weird.  I was like, the top of it, the...  Hang on, I'm going to dance while I'm doing this.  This old guy's loving you.  He's loving you.  Show your ass to this guy.  Oh, no.  I don't want to fucking...  Danny, Danny, show him your ass.  Yeah, show him.  Danny's always good for a good ass shot.  Yeah, I'm going to get right in there, Danny.  They're going to dance like they're going to be happy.  I'm going to get...  Open it up.  Open it up, Danny.  I'm going to put it right in there.  Ready?  Go.  Go.  It's right up Danny's ass crack. 
[02:15:30]  He loves it.  He loves it.  The guy loves it.  He ain't leaving.  He's smelling his gun.  He ain't leaving.  I like it.  You like it?  You want more?  You want more?  Holy shit.  This old guy's loving Danny's ass.  Show us your wife.  He loves my ass.  Show us your wife again.  Show us your wife.  This is his wife right there.  Hi.  How you doing?  Yikes.  Did she just get out of a tub? 
[02:16:00]  They're there at the Overlook.  They're just...  Yeah.  Bobby's now leaning the phone against one of the mic stands and just dancing in front of...  So, anyways, my cock.  Yeah, what's wrong with your cock?  I told you last time I was...  Like, I was...  The fingerprint was fucking...  I thought I was jerking off too much.  Yeah.  And I was like...  The fingerprint on my cock was...  Like, on one side was shiny.  Like, I was rubbing the fingerprint off.  Oh, shit.  You know what it was?  Why?  I was panicking because I was like, oh, my God.  This shit ain't going away. 
[02:16:30]  I thought it was like a fucking yeast infection or something fucked up or some bad shit from  back in the day that was just...  That I had for, like, 20 years.  The creeping crud.  Yeah.  I went in.  He was like, ah...  The guy looked at it.  So embarrassing.  Fucking embarrassing.  You go in and you take...  Was it like a shiny spot or something?  It was a...  On my helmet was shiny.  You ever see those fucking crazy bald porn guys and they just have that shiny red helmet?  It's just like their dick has been abused for 20 years. 
[02:17:00]  What do you have?  Yeah.  What do you got?  It was nothing.  I walked in.  He goes, oh, that's fucking finger flukka flukka flukka.  And he goes, here, just...  That's from working out at a gym.  You worked out.  You didn't fucking...  You probably kept your underwear on and your dick was, you know, from being...  Having a wet cock.  You got athlete's dick.  Is that what you got?  Believe me, I've never been...  I don't have athlete's anything.  What?  Oh.  Athlete's cum in your mouth.  The only thing I have, an athlete's dick. 
[02:17:30]  So it's from what?  Working out?  There's fucking 90 jokes on that.  Why don't we start?  Please.  So you're working out to the point you got a shiny fucking dickhead.  It's this thing.  It's called fingle flukka flukka.  I don't know what the fuck it was called, but it's from working out.  Get Dr. Steve on the phone.  You can work out and you've...  I want to know what this is.  He said no.  This is what he's telling his wife.  Oh, is that...  I have him on fucking...  I have him on chat right now.  This guy is still here.  He's just listening to the show and laughing now.  Maybe we get a new fan out of it. 
[02:18:00]  So this is my pal talk.  This is my fan base.  It's one to one.  That's all you get.  One at a time.  Making fans one at a time here.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, dude.  It was basically...  You can't fuck.  I can't jerk off.  Can't have sex for a week.  Is it a fungus?  Maybe.  Maybe something like that.  Why?  What did he ask you to put on it?  It was just...  Tophactin, tenactin, cortisone, quarter-fucking-cream. 
[02:18:30]  Tophactin, tenactin.  Tophactin, tenactin.  I had those little monsters on my cock.  Ah, the ones that get under your toenails.  I had those little ghetto monsters in my cock.  The ones that scrape you under your toenails and it creeps you out on the commercial.  Or the fucking phlegm ones that are having a party in your lungs.  What do you got on your cock?  I got the ones that are in the tub.  He got scrubbing bubble dicks.  He got scrubbing bubble dicks.  Woo!  So what are they...  It was...  He said, just don't get it wet for a week. 
[02:19:00]  If you take a shower really quick, I'd use this fucking no detergent, no smelly shit,  no nothing, and put this cream on three times a day.  Your cock is like gizmo.  Don't feed it after midnight.  All right, don't get it wet.  What's wrong with you?  So, dude, I put this shit on, it's back to normal.  Two days.  Two days.  He goes, this is...  He was like so confident.  He goes, I'm taking a swab just to prove myself right. 
[02:19:30]  It was embarrassing, though, because when the guy first came in, I'm sitting there and  the nurse comes in, who's like this young black girl, she goes, so what's the...  My wife didn't fucking...  So she laughed at your little white dick?  No, not yet.  My wife didn't tell her what I was going in for.  She said, he needs to see a fucking dermatologist.  So I just go in, I thought they knew, but she comes in, she goes, okay, what are you here  for?  And I was like, fuck, I had to save my cock.  So she's like, I'm like, I got a little rash.  It's white and too small. 
[02:20:00]  She said, I know.  I just pulled it down, I go, this, stupid, look at it.  And then she dug it, she dug it out of my pubes like a fucking dead fish, out of a fishing  net.  Pull it out.  She had a cut.  Like a collapsible cup.  Pull it out, like you're going camping with those dumb cups.  Then you had to show the doctor.  Oh, you poor fuck.  Well, she goes, all right. 
[02:20:30]  She goes, okay, cool.  What do you want to do?  Do you want to put this towel over you?  They give you like a paper towel, a big paper towel to pull over your cock.  Or do you want to just wait till the doctor comes in and pull your pants down to your waist?  I'll go, I'll wait till he comes in and I'll just pull them down real quick.  The doctor comes in with like a team of people, like fucking like, we're at Bennegan's and  they're training waitresses.  Dude, you know when the doctor has a cock problem, he's telling everybody, dude, we got a cock.  Come on in.  Come on in.  He didn't know.  That was the embarrassing part.  He walked in and he goes, okay, hi, Mr. Kelly. 
[02:21:00]  Really nice older guy.  Hi, Mr. Kelly.  How are you?  What seems to be the problem?  And I went, I have a rash on my penis.  And he literally just walked out.  Did Kramer flip a junior mint onto it?  Signed phone.  He walked out.  He turned around and went, ah.  Really doesn't want any of it?  He goes, he's not ready.  Well, look, Dr. Steve is on the phone and I want, because you, you've actually described  it, but we don't know what this is really, what it's from.  You're being a little vague. 
[02:21:30]  Dr. Steve knows everything.  I'm being vague.  I just told you I had a rash on my cock.  Everything medical.  Dr. Steve.  Good morning, boys.  Hi, sir.  Bob Kelly is here.  Hi, Steve.  He, he apparently had a problem with his cock.  Let Bobby explain.  All right, yeah, let Bobby explain.  Yeah, because I, I'm a little suspicious here, man.  And then you, uh, will fill us in and let us know what this really is.  You guys are acting like I fucking hold shit back on the show.  Yeah, I know, exactly.  I just told you I had a rash on my cock. 
[02:22:00]  He fucking...  I mean, last time we talked about how his balls stunk, so I'm not...  Yes.  I fixed that.  He's fucked sinks.  How'd you fix the stinky ball problem?  First of all, I shaved all my...  Washing them balls.  I cut them off.  How'd you, how'd you solve that issue?  I just shaved my, all my hair.  Did you?  All of it.  And then I fucking, what was happening is, I think I killed, I think I fucking killed  some root.  Some roots.  No, I'm joking.  Killed some roots.  I have no idea.  How'd you solve your stinky balls problem? 
[02:22:30]  I shaved all my hair and fucking started over.  You shaved your ball hair?  Yeah, they had some dead roots.  Yeah.  And it was like fucking...  It was like fucking...  Like Mel Gibson hair?  No, my ball hair turned into mulch.  That's awesome.  So listen.  So he's got a new problem with his cock.  Dr. Steve, I already know the problem because I went to a doctor, but I'll retranslate for  you.  Yeah, so you can tell us.  See, it looked like the side of my helmet was getting shiny, like I was rubbing the fucking 
[02:23:00]  fingerprint off my cock.  There's a fingerprint on your...  You had a shiny head.  Yes, you can identify people from their cock print.  If you took your cock, the tip of it, dipped it in ink, and rolled it on a fucking piece  of paper...  I do it all the time.  Absolutely, dude.  I'm fucking doing it today.  Of course.  I have a fucking cock-dipping fucking party later.  Cock print.  Can we do that?  Yeah, you can do that.  Not me.  I don't have...  I'm going to wait until I get better.  Again.  Identify...  Wait a minute.  We should fucking have somebody do a crime in the studio with their cock. 
[02:23:30]  Identify it.  No, I say we all do the cock print thing, and then we figure out whose cock is  whose cock.  That wouldn't be...  We'd know because fucking...  We're not fucking doing the print in front of everybody, so of course it's okay.  That's not fair.  That's not fair, because Anthony would take up a whole sheet of paper.  Oh, now!  Go ahead, Dr. Steve.  Shiny cock head.  Right.  Yeah, okay.  So that's it?  It was just shiny?  Was there any redness or any kind of oozing?  Yeah, no oozing, no nothing, didn't feel anything, didn't burn when I peed, didn't itch. 
[02:24:00]  I mean, literally nothing.  It was just shiny.  It was getting shiny.  It was on shiny.  Like, I literally, like, I just rubbed my dick too hard.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, and just rubbed the marks off.  Yeah, but it wasn't that.  It wasn't that, because I didn't, like, fuck around for a while.  Like, I didn't jerk off or nothing.  And it actually spread, like, to the other side.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It started, so then I, that's when I went to the dermatologist. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Now, was it white, or was it just a normal guy?  What's wrong, Bobby?  Bobby's throwing up right now.  He just saw.  Well, not really.  He's getting close.  He dry heaved a little.  Who the fuck?  Somebody should fix that cunt's pussy.  Is that real?  Can I say that?  Yeah, that's real.  Can I say that?  I'm sorry.  That's probably what Lady Gaga looks like.  Oh, God.  Is that like poverty?  That woman's got a prolapsed fucking vaginal canal. 
[02:25:00]  Ugh, fucking look at that.  Just.  God.  Ugh, it's fucking awful.  Edward G. Robinson's mouth.  Just dark meat.  Wah, wah.  Wah.  What is this lovely sight, Danny?  She should have a cigar in it, talking to his thugs.  I wish your asshole matched her pussy.  If you have a fat-lipped pussy, you need a fat-asshole lip.  It should match.  Someone just sent this to me on my Facebook.  They said if you like, you know, if you guys can check it out on Tumblr accounts today,  this one is lippychicks.  Yeah, I don't like lippychicks. 
[02:25:30]  lippychicks.  Not a fan of lippychicks.  They should all just be girls with black eyes.  I want to go fishing with that.  It looks like earthworms.  Oh, shit.  Match the fucking snatch.  Oh, shit.  Match the snatch.  Oh, shit.  Oh, oh, oh, that's Photoshop.  That's what's her name?  Who is that?  That's Photoshop.  It's Hermione.  Oh, shit.  That's not her?  No.  Fuck, dude.  I got real...  There's nothing turns me on more than celebrity fucking nudity.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Why do we love celebrity nudity?  It's like seeing your teacher at their fucking grocery store.  It's like, you're human? 
[02:26:00]  Oh, my God.  Only a lot better.  You know what I mean?  I kind of like that.  You're human.  Dr. Steve, anyway, he went to the doctor and was told that something about his dick being  like if you exercise and don't change your underwear or if you keep your underwear wet  or something.  He had some kind of thing, which I'm thinking is a fungus.  He made him put, what, some kind of cortisone cream on it.  So what is this, Dr. Steve?  Okay.  Well, there are a couple of things.  One would be a fungus because if you had a little localized fungus, you'd get some inflammation 
[02:26:30]  in that area and some swelling of the tissue and it would kind of obliterate the normal  markings of the tissue.  And they would normally give you an antifungal cream, like clotrimazole or lamacil or something  like that.  And they may even give you one with a cortisone in it.  The other thing is there's this thing called Zoon's plasmacell balanitis. 
[02:27:00]  That's not it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I don't like the sound of that.  Bobby is misrepresenting.  This is what Bobby really has.  What is it?  What is that, Dr. Steve?  It's known for its shiny surface plaque on the glands or the Roman helmet.  And it's usually painless.  It might be accompanied by a little itching.  And nobody knows what causes it, but a steroid cream will make it go away.  And is this communicable?  No.  No.  They don't know. 
[02:27:30]  Well, they don't really know because they don't know where it comes from, but it's not  known to be communicable.  Now, Bobby's doctor told him to stop fucking for, I guess, a week.  But I'm married.  That wasn't a fucking big thing.  I was like, really?  So just act normal?  Go through my daily routine, fucking asshole?  Hey, Dr. Steve, why do you get so many fucking diseases from fucking?  What's that about?  Well, why do you have to catch all this shit from just having sex? 
[02:28:00]  It's the same reason, like, delicious cupcakes make you fat.  Yeah, I don't know.  All the good shit's bad.  But why?  I don't be listening sometimes.  Well, think about it.  First off, it's a good place for viruses and fungi and things to be transmitted.  Dark, wet, warm.  Dark and wet, exactly.  Yeah, like the grotto or my jacuzzi.  Nature knows you're going to go there.  I mean, it's hard for you to transmit something nose to nose if you're not touching your nose. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, but it just doesn't seem fair, Dr. Steve.  Well, it doesn't seem fair.  Yeah, like, did they have this shit back in the day, Dr.?  I mean, is this some of this stuff new?  I know AIDS is new, but what else is new?  Like, did they have warts back in the day?  Like, in the Old West, and they just had to let their dicks look like tree trunks?  Yes, and they called it leprosy back then.  Any kind of skin disorder that was chronic was called leprosy.  So that's why we don't really have these really good dicks.  Oh, they just put them all together to the leprosy category back then and gonorrhea. 
[02:29:00]  But syphilis was a big one.  It killed a lot.  I love to see Dr. Steve in the Old West.  Well, we're going to have to put leeches on it and bleed you out for a bit.  But make sure you catch my rolling wagon show where I sell elixirs on the weekend.  I'll bite into this bullet, and I'm going to put gunpowder into the wound.  And we'll cauterize it. 
[02:29:30]  Dr. Steve, I didn't know what Bobby had.  It was frightening me, so I'm glad.  Dr. Steve will always put my mind at ease.  You have to, especially you, even with the pool.  You have to make sure that you don't go to bed or sit around with wet shit on your junk.  And you're fucking, you're fucking so much.  I mean, all the fucking you're doing.  But what am I doing?  In that tight, fucking really tight underage pussy, it might give you, it might fuck your dick up.  How is that going to fuck your dick up? 
[02:30:00]  Dr. Steve comment?  It seems like it would only be good for it.  Exactly.  Now, the thing about, like, being in the pool, right?  And, like, I wear swim trunks, but I wear regular briefs, tighty-whities underneath.  Because I don't like the feel of my dick rubbing against that netting.  That's fucking...  No, no, the netting that's inside the swim trunks, it hurts the fucking tip of your dick.  Yours.  It does.  It really does. 
[02:30:30]  You're a fucking whale dick.  So, I wear briefs.  I think it's against the law to put your fucking dick in netting.  I think Captain Watson from Whale Wars will show up on the Bob Barker and fucking try to sink your ship.  Shut up, Bobby.  But, now, what kind of danger is there for me to wear my briefs maybe for the rest of the night if I'm hanging out at the pool, right?  And then I sit in the chair by the table and hang out and drink a few beers.  Is that bad for me to sit around in my wet shorts? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  I mean, the reason that bathing suits have netting in them is so that they'll dry out quickly.  So you don't get the fungi.  You don't get fun guys.  And so if you touch the crabs...  You are a fucking fun guy.  Are you using chlorine or Bacquacil?  Sir, I am using a saline.  I have a salt water pool.  Look at that hot pussy.  Hold on, Dr. Steve.  We just found some hot pussy.  Oh, god damn it.  That's a disgusting fucking... 
[02:31:30]  What, you don't like pussy, Bobby?  What's wrong with you?  You show me that fucking every time I'm in here, you fucking creeper.  Dr. Steve, what's worse?  The chlorine or the salt?  It's the blue waffle, Bobby.  Oh, yeah, the blue waffle.  Yeah, you showed me that.  Oh, we've shown you the blue waffle?  Hey, Dr. Steve, have you ever seen the blue waffle?  Yeah, we...  I'm sorry, man.  I showed it to Bobby last time I was on.  All right, but what is the blue waffle?  Most people have seen it by now.  What disease is that?  I'll be honest with you.  I think that's a myth because...  Yeah, that's a photo.  ...I've done thousands of pelvic exams and very... 
[02:32:00]  Legal and illegal.  ...in really unfortunate circumstances.  He can see him in a basement like in Germany.  That woman, she sat on boysenberry hotcakes.  And then her pussy got attacked by a bear.  Dr. Steve...  ...or something.  It just doesn't...  It's not anatomically real.  Yeah, that doesn't look correct.  Well, the pelvic exams...  I think we might have asked you this in the past,  but maybe you can refresh everyone's memory. 
[02:32:30]  Do you get really excited when you got that teenage girl  in the waiting room for her pelvic exam?  You know, you really do get to the point where...  And very quickly, that it's just another part of the anatomy.  Wait, wait, hold on a minute.  I hear you.  Wait, I didn't hear what he said.  It probably is.  What did you say?  No, I didn't hear what you said.  Just fucking fall for it for the sake of the goddamn listeners. 
[02:33:00]  What did you say?  It just really is another part of the anatomy.  You're a liar!  Goddamn liar!  I love the fact that he said...  Wait, wait, wait.  I see the answer in front of him.  Could you say that again?  Because we didn't hear you.  Oh, I thought you had one.  Yeah, it's just another part of the anatomy.  Oh, I thought you had one.  Yeah, it's just...  Shenanigan!  Shenanigan!  Shenanigan!  It's just...  You have to.  Otherwise, you wouldn't...  Wait, Dr. Steve, I'm sorry.  Anthony was out of the room.  Could you just say that again, please? 
[02:33:30]  Is it exciting to see a girl like that?  It really is just another part of the room that we are using chlorine.  Yeah, yeah.  Technically.  So you're not using salt.  But the pool water is a little salty.  It's not like a chlorine sheet.  It's not as chlorine-y.  Yeah.  I've been in both, and I've looked at both of them, and I think that it seems to me that  the salt water pool is less irritating, but I don't know.  It really is.  And I'll tell you something.  That fucking thing is crystal clear. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  Salt water is way better.  All year long, crystal clear.  It doesn't fog up like chlorine.  Very nice.  And my cock, uh, uh, nary, nary a problem.  Uh, knock wood.  You gotta stop wearing fucking tighty-whities.  First of all, you're not...  Stop being white trash and buying tighty-whities.  Look, I'm not a boxer guy.  I'm not either, dude.  I don't like boxers, but you can get the...  I don't like boxers.  Boxer briefs.  Boxer briefs.  Boxer briefs are okay, but try pulling your cock out when you're taking a piss through the  pant leg.  I'm with Anthony. 
[02:34:30]  Because I lift up the fucking leg, and my cock comes out, and I piss that way.  I'm not going to deal with the hole.  Do you lift it up?  Do you have to lift it up?  You just have to use your pinky and open a little hole, and it flops out.  I'll show you how it starts.  I wear golf knickers, and it just sticks out the bottom.  Dr. Steve, so now...  What do you say, knickers?  Knickers.  All right, listen.  You...  Listen, Dr. Steve, now you got the grandma in the waiting room.  Same shit.  It's just another part of the body?  Yeah, absolutely.  You're fucking...  Ah, what the Christ...  You're a liar. 
[02:35:00]  Actually...  You're a liar.  We talked about this last time, that old lady vagina is actually...  Really has less odor and scent to it because...  Because it's dead.  It has no cells in it.  It's dead.  It's like walking through the Dead Sea.  You don't smell anything anymore.  All the hair is see-through?  Like polar bear hair.  You can see yourself in her pussy hair. 
[02:35:30]  What's the oldest pussy you've ever seen?  Unfortunately, I don't think I have an answer.  No, Dr. Steve, what's the oldest pussy you've ever seen?  The oldest?  Oh, gosh.  I don't know.  80s.  Wow.  What does that look like?  Was it prolapsed?  It's an 80-year-old vagina, but the one thing I can say about the 80-year-olds is I've  never had to pull out a...  It looks like ladybug eggs.  You just stepped on something.  It might have been really good.  Sorry.  You said you never had to pull out of an 80-year-old.  Pull out a month-old condom? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, and I was saying, in the 80-year-old ladies, I've never had to pull out a two- to  three-month-old condom that's been lost.  I lost a rubber in a girl's.  Because they didn't have condoms back then when they were fucking...  It's just...  It's fucking like some kind of sheep penis sheep.  Pulled out a wooden tooth.  Or a fucking sickle.  Sickle.  Yeah, Dr. Steve...  Oh, wow!  Yeah, that's an old broad right there.  One time I lost a condom inside a girl, and I was fishing around for it and couldn't find 
[02:36:30]  it, and then I just didn't tell her.  Yeah.  You're a romantic.  Is that bad?  Should I have told her, hey, look, I lost a condom in you?  You might want to go find that.  Dude, that is a very common thing.  I've had multiple times that I've been doing a pelvic exam and pulled out an old condom,  and you know that the guy knew.  Oh, really?  Of course he knew.  Do you suck on it like a freezy pop? 
[02:37:00]  Dr. Steve, you ever pass out after sex, and then you stagger to the bathroom in the  middle of the night, and you're taking a leak, and you don't hear nothing, and all of a  sudden you look down in your fucking sleep days and see a big, huge water balloon forming?  What?  What do you fucking...  Fucking happen to me once?  What do you cum crazy glue?  That fucking happened to me once.  I understand you get a little dam up, and then it bursts through.  No, I'm talking the condom's still fucking on.  He's talking about the condom's still on.  Oh, my God!  Happened to me once in college. 
[02:37:30]  Like he's playing a game at a carnival with a clown's face.  I just want to make it explode.  I passed out, so the thing was still on.  Staggered to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and I'm doing one of those middle  of the night long P's going, wait a minute, I haven't heard water yet.  Swear to God.  Looked down, and a big water balloon is forming.  Holy shit.  Nice buzz, right?  Right, Doc?  Tell me you ran back in the room and went, dude, look at this.  Dude.  Dude, look at this.  How about, hey, Dr. Steve, do you save the condoms you find, like pickers, like American 
[02:38:00]  pickers, and see if they're worth money?  Puts them in a big jar.  This condom I found.  I know an ear, nose, and throat doctor that saves all the stuff he pulls out of people's  noses, and he's got a big display.  Like what?  Yeah, what?  Kids shoves shit.  That's got to be a short list.  Kids and retards, they shove shit in their noses.  And beans, and big old beetles, and stuff like that.  Beetles?  They found them up their nose?  Yeah.  Yes.  Retards.  Kids and retards. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, little kids and retards.  They love shoving shit in their nose.  It's amazing.  It should be the name of a CD if you ever come up with one.  Little kids and retards.  Just you with a big retarded dick.  Jesus.  Where's Patrice?  Bye.  An x-ray that circled around the hospital for a while.  It was a guy with nine Barbie heads shoved up his ass.  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  We've done the ass x-ray bit on our show. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, a lot of trophies.  A lot of trophies.  A lot of guys like trophies up their ass.  Just the head?  No, the whole fucking thing.  I sat on it by accident.  What?  I sat on it by accident.  Yeah.  What was the one?  The guy said he sat on a doorknob by accident?  They had to bring him and the fucking whole door to the hospital?  The whole door.  No, who fell?  Who the...  Wait, what's the story?  We didn't...  The guy was up on a ladder, yeah.  On a ladder.  Changed a light bulb and fell onto something...  He fell onto a tree.  He's from Brazil.  There's a guy...  No, there's a guy changing a... 
[02:39:30]  He's doing some tree work.  He fell off the ladder onto the tree.  It went up his asshole all the way up next to his heart.  They had to cut...  The lady came out.  He's sitting on the tree like this.  They had to come cut the tree off, put him on his belly.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  Put him on his belly.  Find the fucking story.  Put him on...  There's video.  Put him on the belly and they had to cut his stomach open.  Cut the tree in three parts and then pull it out.  Didn't hit one organ.  It skimmed his fucking...  Dr. Steve, is this possible? 
[02:40:00]  We're trying to find the story.  But what was the other one where the guy fell changing a light bulb and claimed he fell  right onto something really unusual?  Like a trophy.  I can't remember.  It's the common excuses when they come into the emergency room that they sat on the light  bulb or they sat on the Coke bottle or whatever.  Yeah.  Wow, Sarah Palin's daughter has really nice boobs.  Nobody ever does it on purpose.  Did you know that before?  Wow, she does.  Did you see how big those are?  We were just looking at Bristol.  Oh, sorry, Dr. Steve.  We got bored, so we started looking at boobs.  What were you saying? 
[02:40:30]  Bristol Palin's tits.  She's pretty hot.  She's pretty hot.  Yeah, she's all right, that girl right there.  I didn't realize they were so big.  Oh, yeah.  Sitting up nice.  She's back with Levi or Levy or whatever the fuck his name is.  Yeah, good for them.  Just a little gossip for you.  Oh, from TMZ.  Hope a polar bear eats both of them.  Gives a shit.  But he leaves the tits.  I'd love to just see her tits.  On the ice.  Just her torso with just her fat tits.  It's not a boating accident.  It's a rough word to say, isn't it? 
[02:41:00]  Tits.  Dr. Steve.  Yes, sir.  Well, thank you for calling.  You know, always leave them wanting more, I say.  Yeah, there you go.  Hey, Steve, thanks for...  I'm going to plug my show this weekend, except I heard a promo for some other show.  Oh, well, why don't you give the big plug for everybody, because you do a great job on the O&A show.  Dr. Steve.  Yeah, that's actually...  Get out of here. 
[02:41:30]  Why didn't he say, I know what you're going to do, and then diffuse it, and then he'd get his plug out.  Why didn't he see that coming a mile away?  Because Opie has a great, nice voice.  You know, right now...  I do have a great, nice voice.  Opie has a fucking mesmerizing, nice voice.  All I can do is picture...  Thank you, Bobby, for noticing.  All I can do is picture him on the phone, on the other end, when that happens, just going like,  you motherfucker.  It must be very uncomfortable for him.  Actually, he's slicing the little girl's neck that he has tied up. 
[02:42:00]  Just going...  Jesus.  You think he's lying?  It wasn't me.  It wasn't me.  You think he's lying about the pussy thing?  Well, if you notice what he said, he goes, after a while.  So that means...  So for a while, it was like, holy shit.  Yeah, I mean...  God damn it, why didn't we pick up on it?  That is good.  After a while, I...  After a while was key to that.  Yeah.  After a while, shemale porn was boring to me, too.  You know what I mean?  You go to work, and all of a sudden, you see that in your waiting room?  In the waiting room?  And you're saying it's just another organ? 
[02:42:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  I've smelled the girl's underwear.  Like, when I was in a room once.  Yeah.  Like, this girl's room.  And I wasn't supposed to.  You know, it was just air, and I went in, and I just found her underwear, and I took  a sniff, like that, and I was like, and then I went like this, and then I went...  Oh.  Dude, do you remember when your finger would smell for, like, three days, like the girl  you were with?  Like, because you wouldn't wash your...  But why don't they smell anymore?  And because that scent is only on girls that are, like, 14, 15, and 16. 
[02:43:00]  No.  Something else is going on.  You bring up a good point.  When we were growing up, that smell would stay around.  Why doesn't it stay around anymore?  The next day, you'd be going to school, and you'd be like, smell your finger.  Our soaps must be better.  Our soaps are better at washing pussy smell away.  No, we're actually...  We're more careful.  No, it's like there was that distinct, like...  Yeah.  And the next day, you would, like, bring your fingers up to your nose and go like, oh, my 
[02:43:30]  God.  Oh.  And you get, like, a raging heart on.  Pussy had...  Pussy smell was something I had to grow into, dude.  I didn't like eating pussy right away, either.  I grew into really liking it, but it was something...  It was just something I had to get into.  It was like, now, I love eating pussy.  I don't give a fuck.  I'll eat an asshole, a pussy.  I don't give a shit about...  I dove in like it was Twizzlers.  Yeah, but Bobby's on.  I mean...  When I first did it.  One of my first girlfriends almost ruined it for me, because I brought it up many times.  She had that smelly pussy disease. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, I had a chick with the same thing.  So I thought, because I was so inexperienced, I thought all pussy smelled like that, so  I was fucking scared after that for a while.  You had to...  It was horrendous.  I had a hot chick.  It was as bad as they say it is.  This girl went to suck my dick, and she almost threw up.  I go, it wasn't me, because we fucked first.  It wasn't me.  She literally...  Ugh.  And I was like, it wasn't me.  She goes, I know.  Her pussy smelled.  That is a...  Get Dr. Steve back on the phone.  That is a real fucking horror show, man, when you get one of those.  Bad pussy. 
[02:44:30]  Well, we've talked to him about that, though.  It is a hard...  It isn't a little bit that you could deal with.  This is like, what the fuck?  It's a pH problem.  Yeah.  There's yeast infections.  It's a dark, moist, warm place where a lot of things can grow.  But think about it.  They grow mushrooms in the exact atmosphere that a pussy is.  It's the same condition.  But are they poisonous?  Can I tell Bobby my favorite story?  I was in Geneseo, and this is the truth.  So, I'm with this girl, you know, and finger popped her, whatever. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  And then I had to drive home from Geneseo like six and a half hours, and I swear to you...  His airbag went off.  For most of the ride, I've told the story many times, but I don't think you've heard it before.  I had my hand out the window.  That's how bad it was.  It was bad?  It was that fucking bad.  That's bad.  I scrubbed everything, and I couldn't get it.  So, I had my hand out the fucking window for most of the ride.  What the...  I don't know, man.  It was horrendous.  With Pepe Le Pew fumes coming off of it, that green fucking wafting cartoony thing. 
[02:45:30]  Pepe?  Me?  No.  It was a free ride, though, because none of the toll guys would take my money.  Goodness gracious!  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen!  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  I know.  All your change turned green.  It was bad, dude.  Whoops.  Ah, what the Christ.  Oh, Dr. Steve's back. 
[02:46:00]  Ah.  Dr. Steve, weird medicine, Saturday nights at midnight?  Midnight.  Okay.  Not this week.  Because now I feel like I have to fucking plug.  Something happened.  You were disconnected.  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  I fucked up, Steve.  I pushed the button.  I didn't mean to push it.  Steve knows this show too well.  Dr. Steve, we probably talked about it on the show before, but I mean, we get new listeners  all the time and people coming and going.  So the really bad, smelly, pussy thing, what is that?  Not talking about a little bit that you could deal with. 
[02:46:30]  We're talking about over-the-top, holy shit.  What is it?  There are good bacteria and there's bad bacteria.  Oh!  Or lactobacillus.  And that's the normal bacteria of the vagina.  Oh, my.  It's a very sweet-smelling and actually it's the same bacteria that makes yogurt into yogurt.  Oh!  Oh, wow.  Like Greek yogurt or Yoplait?  Like fucking what?  Activia makes you shit. 
[02:47:00]  You eat the bitch out and you just start shitting.  Am I getting sick of that cunt on TV?  Oh, we talk about her, too.  Oh, Jamie Lee Curtis and her shit yogurt.  All right.  She was a hermaphrodite.  You know she had a penis, right?  In fact, I have a picture of it.  We don't know for sure.  Urban legend.  I have it in a jar.  Urban legend.  Like with Dillinger's dick.  It was signed Halloween.  I had Mike Myers.  The best part of those commercials are the Activia challenge.  With the chicks with the video?  Well, you're watching going, holy, this is a shit challenge. 
[02:47:30]  It's a shit challenge.  They just know how to clean it up for TV.  I've been eating Activia now for a week and I have noticed a difference.  I shit my pants on the way home.  It's terrible.  Oh, Bobby, you want to comment?  You're no Jim Norton when it comes to farting into a mic, my friend.  I think I just shit my pants up.  I'm actually better.  You took the Activia challenge and you won.  Dr. Steve.  Yes, back to smelly pussy, Dr. Steve.  Yes.  So, well, the bacteria lactobacillus are the normal flora of the vagina, as I said. 
[02:48:00]  The flora?  Flora.  Flora.  Yes.  You know, the normal things that are supposed to live in the vagina.  When they...  My cuck.  When they lose their foothold, they can be taken over by a couple other things.  Is there a war going on in her pussy?  It's like water, Lou.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's a constant battle of the vagina going on.  I can't wait until they make an app for that, like a game, an iPhone game.  World War Pew. 
[02:48:30]  Pussy Lou.  They had bacteria moving into the neighborhood, if you know what I mean.  Yes.  Oh, we know how that happens.  One moves in and the whole fucking...  There goes the neighborhood.  It's a world war pew.  That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.  And so this bacteria kind of, you know, they make pals, they reproduce, and before you know it...  And it's called Gardnerella, and they smell like... 
[02:49:00]  Sister's name.  It's like Middle Earth.  Yeah.  Middle Earth.  There's a fucking troll trying to fucking get a ring back to her asshole.  It's terrible.  Oh, it is terrible.  So what...  One of the ways that we'll diagnose that is to take some vaginal fluid.  And put it on a slide.  Do you take a banana and stick it in if it comes out fucking green and mushy?  Oh, Jesus.  With a bite taken out of it?  So you actually take some vaginal fluid, you wipe it on a slide, and look at it under a microscope? 
[02:49:30]  What does it look like under a microscope?  Well, no, you don't have to look at it.  It's worse than that.  You put some potassium hydroxide on it, and then you smell it.  Oh, no!  You've got to smell bad pussy.  You've got to smell...  How ancient is that?  Isn't there a machine that could do that, Dr. Steve?  Well, I'm sure there is, but...  But you like doing it that way.  Yeah.  You could also taste it.  I licked the slide.  Right.  Much like an artichoke leaf.  What does it look like under a microscope? 
[02:50:00]  Well, it doesn't...  Well...  Does it look like an aerial view of Haiti?  What does it look like?  It looks like District 9.  I like setting up my own jokes.  It's so much fun.  Can't you just pour peroxide on her pussy, and if it looks like Cujo, just don't fuck it?  I think you get that effect anyway, because there are other bacteria in there that would  cause it.  Yeah.  Peroxide bubbles at anything. 
[02:50:30]  Jesus.  Fucking temperamental shit.  From the microscope, you'll see cells that have bacteria adherent to them, and those are  called clue cells, and that's another indication that you've got the bacteria.  Children in the background.  What a creep you sound like, talking about this with a child in the background.  I know.  I know.  They're getting a good education.  I guess they are.  Are they his?  Oh, my God.  This guy in the line, Mike from Maine. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, I hope he tells it as well as it's written on the fucking phone thing here.  Mike in Maine.  Go ahead.  You're on with Dr. Steven, and you got us as well.  Go ahead.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Go ahead.  Hey, okay.  Yeah, we're going to the smelly cunt thing.  We live right next to the Canadian border, and we've been going to strip clubs since we've  been in high school.  And there was this one time, we were a bunch of us at the strip clubs, and the seats are right  next to the stage, and she was doing her thing on the pole, and the bitch, the bitch's fucking  cunt smelled so bad, we started yelling, like, oh, your fucking pussy stinks, and this 
[02:51:30]  and that.  They cut the music, and they hauled her off the fucking stage.  She stunk so fucking bad.  I mean, I thought this was the same chick, this was a few years ago, but she actually  did the whole pole thing, where she slides down the pole, and the pole was fucking wet  after she split it down.  Had a greasy smear on it.  Oh, yeah.  It actually melted.  It corroded like when an alien gets cut.  The manager's like, if you fucking ruin one more pole, you dirty cunt Canadian. 
[02:52:00]  They grabbed her and threw her out.  Great job.  Where was the strip club?  LV426?  District 9?  District 9?  Alien.  Alien?  Love Alien.  Fuck, I've got to watch Alien.  It's a great movie.  All right, thank you, Mike.  You never miss it.  Hey, it's coming out on Blu-ray.  It's coming out on Blu-ray.  Fighting her cunt with a robot?  Did Dr. Steve answer any of our questions?  I don't know.  Oh, I love Dr. Steve. 
[02:52:30]  It doesn't matter if he answers him or not.  We just use you for comedy fodder.  We don't care if we get real info out there.  But Bobby did mention, and thank God for Bobby.  We were talking about the pussy thing when you see a young, like a teenage girl in the  waiting room until you get excited.  And your answer, and we didn't pick up on it.  Bobby did.  You said, after a while.  My dick doesn't get hard, and I don't want to fucking finger fuck the mother out.  You said, after a while, it just looks like any other organ.  So now you're admitting there was a time where you were like, oh my God, this is going to be  a great day.  Well, there's no question about it that when you're learning, it's a real learning product. 
[02:53:00]  That's right.  Lower your voice as you talk about it.  They have these people called talking pelvises, and they are women who volunteer to teach medical  students how to do a pelvic exam.  Did you hear this?  Oh, wow.  Hold on.  I've got to slow you down.  That has to be a girl that gets off on that whole thing.  That's her fucking thing.  So if you're volunteering your pussy so doctors could do pelvic exams? 
[02:53:30]  They're very strict and very, I mean, they take, if you had any idea as a medical student  that there was going to be any sexuality involved in this whatsoever, they quickly disabuse you.  So you can't, let's say you have the speculum in your mouth, there's going to be a problem.  Right.  Yeah, if you go to the vagina and you go, oh God.  Or you sniff and go, all right, let's get started. 
[02:54:00]  What if you walk up to the pussy and go, yeah, suck a dick.  Suck a dick.  Show me what you look like.  Suck a dick.  Say you like suck a dick.  They're all business.  They're very strict.  They're, you know, the one I had was not even very nice.  And it very quickly kind of turned things around to where you realize this is just all business  and it's just part of it.  You know what, when I was in art school and college and I had to take my first drawing  class, like charcoal and you have to sketch nudes, I was right up front, ready to go, 
[02:54:30]  first day.  And then this chick came in.  A dude came in the first day with his fucking huge uncircumcised cock, which was hard to  draw.  Nice.  It was hard to draw the fucking tip of an uncircumcised cock.  I was all prepared for the helmet, like a regular American helmet.  Did you just open up a book with an aardvark in it?  I'm trying to draw that.  That's a test to see who's gay in the class, by the way.  Is it?  The one that has all the details of the cock that's fucking sketched out. 
[02:55:00]  If there's some guy that's leaving the room with a bunch of charcoal stains on his cock,  like on his pants, in front of his...  I drew all the ventricles on his cock.  Exactly.  Spending a little too much time.  Yeah.  Making sure it's just right.  You did get a lot of nudes, and after a while, it was like, no fucking big deal.  But I...  It wasn't...  It wasn't not a big deal, but I...  You still have to, like, fantasize a little bit.  You still jerked off...  You had to have jerked off a little bit, Dr. Steve, when you went home to some of those 
[02:55:30]  pussies.  To one patient that came in?  Oh, Dr. Steve.  They make it.  I have a problem.  I just love cock so much.  I think there's a problem with my vagina.  Could you look at it?  Can you hold my lollipop?  That is just so wrong that you just can't...  As a matter of fact, there are a lot of OBGYNs that, when they're first starting out, they  get turned off of sex altogether.  Wow.  You know, just for a while, and then it normalizes.  Yeah.  It becomes a normal part of your life.  It's like the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan, I guess. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Do you have any...  And after a while, you just get used to it.  Yeah.  You don't want to know the names of the vaginas that come in, because they're just going  to die anyway.  Have you ever had any, like, Dr. Bloopers where you slipped and fell into a pussy?  What the fuck?  You know what I mean?  This is a very good question.  Like, you ever just have a blooper where you're actually, you're trying to fucking do something  and you, you know...  A gag reel.  Sneeze into it by accident.  Yeah, you sneezed in her pussy by accident and...  No, but I, one of my preceptors was doing a colonoscopy on a woman once and got in, accidentally 
[02:56:30]  put it in her vagina instead and wondered why he couldn't advance it more than a couple  of inches.  Oh, my God.  That's happened to me with my dick.  I meant to fuck her in the ass, Dr. Steve.  Oh, it's a funny story I'll tell you someday.  Let me ask you a question.  You can fuck, like, your asshole's longer than the pussy? 
[02:57:00]  Oh, my God, yeah.  Really?  Miles is an asshole.  It's amazing.  I mean, a baby comes out of a fucking pussy, so it's got to go up.  I mean, maybe, maybe it's not longer.  Maybe there's, like, more left and right turns.  Dr. Steve, what is the average length of a vaginal canal up to, from, let's say, the  labia to the cervix?  To the cervix.  Yeah, how much can Anthony get a cock into a regular vagina?  When you do a pelvic exam, you kind of put your foot up on the stool and then rest your 
[02:57:30]  arm on your leg and then to stabilize yourself.  Like the thinker.  And then it takes two fingers, basically, up to the knuckle to feel the cervix and push  up on it so that you can palpate the uterus on the outside.  Yeah.  So it's a, it's a, what is that?  It's about six inches.  That's, yeah, about six inches.  So the average size penis and the average size vaginal canal.  Is six inches.  Which is a. 
[02:58:00]  That's perfect.  Match.  Perfect match.  So Anthony, Anthony is seven times bigger than their average vagina.  But I have bottomed out.  It's good when they go, ow, because you hit cervix.  But you actually hear, like a, like a two by four behind sheetrock?  No, after ow, you hear, I want my mommy.  Oh, Jesus.  And you're a school bell in the distance and a van door opening and shutting real quick.  Would you?  Yeah.  Why do some girls have shallow vaginas?  Well, I mean, why do some people have blonde hair and, you know, it's just a natural variation 
[02:58:30]  in genetics.  Boring.  Boring.  Some people got bigger dicks than others.  I know.  It's not about, it's, I've been, you've hit a back wall, right, Bobby?  But that's, that's the same thing.  You've never hit a back wall?  No.  It's like the same thing.  I've never, I've never heard a girl go, ow.  I've never heard, I've never heard, that's it.  I've never heard, hit a back wall.  No.  I fucked a chick with an angled, a weird angled pussy.  Like, I had to, like, I couldn't fuck her, like, lying down. 
[02:59:00]  I had to have her, it was like a weird angle.  Like, it went up and down of some fucking weird angled pussies.  Does that happen?  Like, they get weird angled pussies?  Like, it's way down, like, near the asshole where the asshole should be?  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, there, there is some natural variation.  Then there was like a ball and cock that was, like, kept flopping on mine.  You're going to fit better with certain people just because their anatomy more. 
[02:59:30]  Frankus is calling it the JFK bullet pussy.  Very funny, you asshole.  All right, we're done with Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's let Dr. Steve do what he does best, doctoring.  I think we're going to take a break, too.  We got the latest Mel Gibson info next.  Oh, it's a great one.  It's a good one.  Yes.  Yeah, you and Big Kev teaming up for the Saturday Night Virus, right?  I actually listened to it.  Two different shows back to back, obviously.  And the belly to belly.  We're alternating weekends is what we're doing. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, so who's on this weekend?  Yeah.  Big Kev's on this weekend, and then he'll actually be on next weekend live from Comic-Con,  and then we're going to alternate weeks from there on.  Oh, so you're not doing a Weird Medicine for a couple weeks?  Yeah, for a couple of weeks.  So it's Big Kev this Saturday night at midnight.  Very cool.  Get a podcast, for fuck's sake.  Yeah, we're very excited about it.  And now we won't have to run any reruns, because I was on a two-week-on-and-one-week-off kind  of rotation because of the...  Shut up.  Oh, God.  He gives a shit. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, my God.  The guy does nothing but help us...  Shut up.  ...and call in whenever we ask.  All right.  Like, immediately.  Oh, my God.  It's Obie's nice...  Obie's nice voice is so nice, and then it...  Yes.  Oh, there goes Bobby's microphone.  Don't fucking talk to me over you.  You're right here, and they can still hear me, shit dick.  Stop with the buttons.  Me and Bobby almost fought at the Louie from here, by the way. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  Did you really?  We understand each other.  We...  Yeah.  What do we have?  I forget what...  We just understand each other.  I don't even want to...  I know his buttons.  He knows mine, and I don't even want to say what it is, because then other people will fucking  start with that nonsense.  But me and Bobby look at each other a lot of times like, God, we are so close to just beating  the shit out of each other.  Yeah.  I would actually like...  And it's in the middle of the Louie premiere.  It's a good day for Bobby.  I actually get to the point in my life where I wouldn't mind fucking fighting somebody.  You looked at me at one point and just said, let's just do it. 
[03:01:30]  Let's just do it.  Let's just fight.  Do it.  Let's just fight.  Let's fucking do it.  Who cares?  What's going to happen?  Someone's going to get...  We're going to get hurt a little bit.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, if I hurt you or you hurt me, it's going to be like, all right, I'm sorry.  Stop.  We'll move on.  Did you...  You know when we were at the premiere?  Probably should do this all fair.  What?  You know that thing we did?  Can we talk about that thing on the air?  Raping that little girl?  Oh, jeez.  Gosh.  I'm kidding.  Ding, ding, ding.  I'm kidding.  Good gosh.  I'll write down a keyword.  All right.  Oh. 
[03:02:00]  Anal.  What?  Oh.  That thing?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Can't do that thing?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  As Ted Knight would say, no, no, no.  Can I tweet it in code?  No.  No.  No.  No tweeting in code?  No.  No?  No.  No.  If that was me, fuck yeah, but no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:02:30]  That's a biggie?  No.  I don't like this guy on fucking Chat Roulette.  He's a cop.  He's in his car, and he's been listening to the whole show via Chat Roulette.  I should swipe him out right now, but he's a cop.  I got to download that app.  He's been watching the whole fucking show.  That's cool.  Chat Roulette, huh?  Chat Roulette.  Look at it.  He's been fucking...  He's been listening to the whole fucking show, but he's a cop.  What's up, brother?  Why don't we take a break?  Let's take a break.  I think we got strawberry rhubarb pie coming into the studio.  Rhubarb sucks.  That was for Jimmy mostly, but you want to try it? 
[03:03:00]  My first sexual experience was in a patch of rhubarb with the blouse, and it made me cry.  I thought God was going to punish me.  She touched my little ding-ding and made me suck on her tits in rhubarb.  Why does it say Chat Roulette light?  Don't get that.  Well, where the fuck is Chat Roulette?  A light must mean it's like, you know, safe.  He keeps holding up his fucking...  All right.  Don't get Chat Roulette.  All right, enough, Bobby. 
[03:03:30]  Jesus.  I feel retarded.  He just said, enough, Bobby.  I didn't do anything. 
[03:04:00]  Enough, Bobby.  You were chastised, Robert.  I was chastised for helping you with your app.  You got me in trouble again, you fucking asshole.  Is the fight going down on the show?  Let's do it.  We should fight.  What if we did this?  What if we got fucking gloves?  Are you a good fighter?  Yeah.  Bobby can fucking...  I can scrap.  But it comes...  Can you box?  I can box a little.  Yeah, I can box.  I can't do MMA shit.  No, I can't either.  I can't do any MMA.  I can throw some, like, close-range elbows. 
[03:04:30]  I have a video of me, you know, the tour I went on?  I have a video of me trying to put a triangle on my friend, and my legs are too short, so  I can't get it on.  It's just a V, and he's like, just sit...  But all my fucking fat weight is holding him down, and he's putting the camera in my face  going, what are you doing?  And I'm like, it's a triangle, and the veins are shooting at him.  We're both almost passing out.  I could never be a fucking MMA fighter.  My legs are too short.  Not my legs.  The part from my hip to my knee just sucks. 
[03:05:00]  Really?  Yeah.  That bad?  It's just a little short, whatever that is.  I think my torso's too short.  Your torso?  You got a long torso.  No, I got long legs.  I mean, I'm almost six, but six foot, I think it was supposed to be like 6'2 or 6'3.  I have a barrel chest, too.  It seems just a little too short.  I have the original Superman chest.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it sucks.  Like the George, was it George Reeve?  What the fuck was the first Superman's name?  Yeah, yeah.  Mayo.  George.  Mayo. 
[03:05:30]  His name was Mayo.  Mayo Khan.  The first Superman.  We're talking about the stupid TV Superman, but...  Yeah, that's the first one.  Well, Big Kev's here.  He would know.  Mayo Khan.  Big Kev, who was the first Superman...  On TV or on film?  On TV.  George Reeve.  George Reeve.  That's what I was talking about.  That's my first Superman.  Who's Mayo Khan?  I have no idea.  Fuck you.  He was the first one on TV.  No, he wasn't.  No, he wasn't.  George Reeve.  Kirk Allen was before that, but I think that was just in series. 
[03:06:00]  I'm going to Google it right now.  Paul Allen.  That goes back to our bit that I don't know if people enjoyed as much as we did.  Like the out of shape.  Out of shape.  In shape guy.  Back in the old days, if you were in shape, out of shape guy.  Did you ever see a picture of him?  They were out of shape, but they were like, wow, he's in shape.  Yeah, for the time, he was like a male specimen or whatever.  Like Chuck Heston when he took his shirt off.  He didn't have a hint of a muscle.  That was funny.  Yeah, out of shape, in shape guy.  Yeah, out of shape, in shape.  They just had rib cages. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Big rib cage because they sucked everything in.  Nowadays, if you don't have a fucking amazing six pack, you're out of the business.  Look at him.  He's just a fucking...  And he doesn't even have a package.  No, he's got nothing going on.  He's wearing undies.  He's wearing fucking underwear and a bad fucking t-shirt with an awful S on his chest.  That's before they made good material for clothes.  That was probably just heavy cut.  Yeah, wool.  Wool.  Poor bastard.  No wonder he killed himself. 
[03:07:00]  Allegedly.  Fuck him.  Could have been shenanigans.  Burt Lancaster in The Swimmer.  Pat from Unaki.  Brilliant.  Because that is the epitome of the bad body, in shape, out of shape guy.  Bobby, look.  Where is he?  Well, that isn't him.  That isn't it.  But no...  Oh, there's another version up there on the right, right?  Yeah.  Oh, whatever.  That's fine.  No.  No.  That's...  Oh, right there, right there. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Out of shape, in shape guy.  I'd actually give anything just to be that.  I'm A-shape.  I'm swimming home.  What the fuck was that movie about?  Right?  You know who's still in good shape?  Clint fucking Eastwood has been in shape his whole life.  Did you see Bridges in Madison County?  No, faggot.  Yeah, exactly.  I had to.  What?  I saw it too, Bobby.  You did not.  Yeah, I did.  Balloon.  Ah, look at you, Bobby. 
[03:08:00]  Look at him.  Wow, he really looks like he's in shape.  He's E.T.  Absolute E.T. body.  Wait a minute.  What is he, fucking 900?  What is he?  He is.  He's an old man.  His belly and tits make him look like Homer Simpson.  That is really bad.  He's not fat, but he's hunched.  What does that look like, though?  It looks like an old lady's face.  If you put hair on his top of his chest.  It looks like a fish. 
[03:08:30]  No.  Like a fish with a mustache.  No, what's the other one?  Does it look like a fish with a mustache?  What's the other Carvel cake?  Not Fudgie the Whale, the other one.  No, it's Cookie Puss.  It's Cookie Puss.  He's got Cookie Puss stomach.  His body looks like Cookie Puss.  His nipples are the eyes, and his belly button is the mouth.  He's a wreck.  All right, Danny got me a song.  Some dude from, what, the 30s came up with this?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I found it the other day.  Oh, the house next door to me? 
[03:09:00]  No?  No, I guess, you know, back in the day, there wasn't a whole lot of dirty songs.  And I guess this guy was kind of like a pioneer of filth.  Wow.  Because he wrote filthy songs with his orchestra.  With his orchestra?  Can we get more of these?  I could probably dig up some more.  Did he get a radio gig out of it?  Hey, laddie, laddie, laddie.  Yeah, kind of.  It was kind of like that.  Falby before his time, I guess. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  There's one pet I like to pet.  And every evening we get set.  I stoke it every chance I get.  It's my girl's pussy.  My, my girl's pussy.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Wasn't that playing at the Overlook Hotel during the ducking goose soiree? 
[03:10:00]  Seldom plays and never purrs.  And I love the thoughts it stirs.  But I don't mind because it hurts.  My girl's pussy.  Often it goes out at night, returns at break of dawn.  No matter what the weather's like, it's always nice and warm.  It's never dirty, always clean.  In giving thrills, never mean.  But it's the best I've ever seen.  It's my girl's pussy. 
[03:10:30]  This is playing when Grady was chopping his kids up with an axe.  You wrote a song about your girl's pussy, didn't you?  Why does it need a musical intro?  It's great.  This is where the cartoon pussies would be dancing in the background.  This is great.  All the bouncing pussy.  All the bouncing pussies.  Stymie's chasing Petey in fast motion.  Stymie and Petey.  What the fuck? 
[03:11:00]  I don't even remember that.  Yes.  Scooby-doo-ba-ba-ba-doo-da-doo.  Yadda-da-da-da.  I can totally do it.  There's one bed I like to bed.  And every evening we get this.  I smoke it every chance I get.  It's my girl's pussy.  Tell them plays, never first.  And I love both in first. 
[03:11:30]  But I don't mind because it's hers.  It's my girl's pussy.  So often you go down at night.  And it doesn't break up, don't break up, don't break up.  No matter what the weather's like.  It's always dry and warm.  I bring tidbits that in love.  We still like to settle down.  I take care to remove my gloves.  When soaking my girl's pussy.  So John Scott says he just jizzed on his spats. 
[03:12:00]  Pats spats.  Pats spats.  This guy had him cracking up down at the old cotton club, I betcha.  Ah, yes.  That was my girl's pussy, everybody.  Here on WQL1.  It looks exactly like you.  Does he?  Yeah.  Yeah, he looks exactly like you.  He looks like my grandfather and my father.  Yeah, maybe.  You know something?  Maybe we all have that gene in us that makes us write dirty, filthy songs and hopefully 
[03:12:30]  be successful doing it.  My girl's pussy.  As long as a colored man wasn't there.  Hey, we got a Mel Gibson update.  She has so much pubic hair.  My girl's pussy.  Because it's old.  We got a Mel Gibson update.  Ah, do we?  We don't have a tape.  They said there was going to be another tape today.  We don't have a tape, but we have pictures. 
[03:13:00]  Pitches?  Yeah, look.  There you go.  That's supposedly what Mel Gibson did to the broad.  Go to RadarOnline.com for the pictures of Mel Gibson's broad.  She looks like she's smiling.  And she's got one chipped...  Is that her?  Oh, shit.  Does she have a fat lip on that one?  Or...  I don't know.  Like, I can't tell.  She might have just a puffy lips.  She almost looks like...  She's smiling.  She's smiling.  And you know why?  Because she's thinking of all the fucking money and houses she's going to get.  The apocalypto money she's going to grab.  She probably did that to herself, too.  Again, The Shining. 
[03:13:30]  She kind of looks like fucking Wendy from The Shining.  This must have been like a...  What?  A post-clean-up shot.  Because, I mean, if you get hit in the face so hard, that teeth break, there's going  to be some...  Yeah, definitely.  Unless you've cleaned this up already.  Well, she's claiming that Mel fucked up her teeth.  Did she have a cap on that one tooth?  Yeah, because I'm confused.  It looks like she got a cap knocked out.  It's half gone, but the cut is perfect.  Like, on that tooth, the one next to it...  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  That cap...  He knocked the laminate off or some shit.  Yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, why...  You fucking...  That was done in Russia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was done in Russia.  I guarantee you the fucking tooth, if you picked up the tooth and analyzed it, it would  be made out of teacups from fucking her fucking dumb Russian grandmother.  Why fix it?  Sit in chair.  I will chip the teacup.  You're perfect to make the tooth for you to go to America, become the whore for the Mel  Gibson.  Yes, it has a flower.  I will paint over flower on teacup.  He will call you the cunt, but you will make the money. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  You take your face, you smash it into toilet bowl.  Yes.  But you're no lucky.  And call the police.  Call the KGB.  The KGB of Hollywood.  The gay police.  Endale yourself to the faggot.  Like Kathy Griffin.  Yes, she loves the fag.  She loves the fag.  Get on Bravo as much as you can.  She doesn't look very good in that picture. 
[03:15:00]  No, she has dark shark eyes.  I don't think she looks very good in any picture.  Oh, she's awful.  Some of the early ones, she's not bad.  Yeah, but she did something to her face, like she's got weird surgery and she looks really  weird.  I think that's a piss smell off because she says you look ridiculous.  She looks like that octomom lady now.  Octomom.  Oh, yeah, good call.  Look at her sunken eyes, too.  I fucking hate sunken eyes.  Yeah, she does.  She's got like a lifeless eyes, dead eyes, like a doll's eyes.  And they're real sunken in.  Yeah.  All black.  There's no nothing. 
[03:15:30]  I don't know.  She, I think whatever Mel says, I think she was kind of, you know, egging them on.  Well, if you listen to the tape, it almost sounds like she was looped in after post-production.  She's so, she knows that she's being recorded, which is unfair in any argument because you  get to fucking be passive aggressive to the point where you're going to make him even  madder.  You know what I mean?  My girl's pussy. 
[03:16:00]  Sorry.  It's just stuck in my head.  I thought I'm going to be singing that all fucking day.  I wanted to be my ringer.  Here's the girl.  What?  Yeah.  Ringtone from the fucking thirties.  Whoa.  Now there's a story on TMZ.  Thank you to Nick from wherever.  It doesn't, it says Nick from dot, dot, dot.  And it's feedback.  Now we're talking extortion.  She tried to blackmail Mel for 10 mil.  Is that popping up on TMZ?  Yeah.  I saw that this morning.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you something.  Also, I know my brother had an issue at one point in his career. 
[03:16:30]  I love that story.  Where a girl took a frying pan and smashed herself in the mouth and called the police.  My brother was summarily arrested and charged with domestic assault.  And, uh, he, he got out immediately and, um, started, uh, planning on how, how to, uh, get her to fess up.  And one of her friends was more of a friend of my brother's.  So it got her to wear a fucking wire and got the, uh, the girl to admit that she smacked herself with a frying pan. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  Because no one, no one's going to, no one's going to believe you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  No one's going to believe you if all of a sudden you go, no, she fucking hit herself with a frying pan.  She hit herself.  Yeah, right.  How many people are going to believe you if you said that to him?  So he had to prove it.  I will tase you.  Turn around.  But I swear, she hit herself with a, right, right, right.  All right, all right.  Okay, okay, okay. 
[03:17:30]  In the end, he, he was telling the truth.  Yes.  Hey, uh, speaking of Mel, what, what's up on the, the extortion thing, Danny?  We don't have to read the whole fucking thing, but now, what is being said on TMZ?  Well, sources connected with Mel Gibson tell TMZ that they have, quote, hard proof that, uh,  Oksana tried to extort him for a 10 mil, uh, in return for keeping the tapes just, uh, secret.  Oh.  Uh, but you know what, though? 
[03:18:00]  That means she fucking taped this shit and went, well, I know how to make a few bucks for myself.  Yeah, but you know what?  I will make a few, uh, rubles.  Yes, but that kind of almost doesn't make sense to me, because for the amount of money that Mel Gibson has, just give her the fucking 10 million.  Yeah, but he's saying, isn't he complaining about money, though?  Isn't he bitching about cash?  He's trying poverty, but let me tell you something.  The type of guy that Mel Gibson sounds like, he ain't fucking fessing 10 million blackmail money.  Yeah, he'd rather, he'd rather have the tapes out.  Yep.  Yeah, fuck him.  Yeah, maybe not the smartest move, but I, I, I'm with Ant. 
[03:18:30]  He's not that kind of guy.  He's that type of guy, like, fuck you.  He's Mad Max, motherfucker.  That's right.  Thunderdome, bitch.  Braveheart.  Right.  Braveheart.  Uh-uh.  Papa.  Fucking signs.  Apocalypto.  There's a pussy in that one.  There you go, Bobby's involved with the bit.  One of my favorite movies.  Avoid all the bad press.  Fucking, he's Riggs, bitch.  Fucking Riggs.  Cheap.  Dude, he's fucking, he's fucking the guy who lost his daughter, and then got angry and killed everybody.  He wasn't as mad at Gary Busey in Lethal Weapon as he is at this bitch. 
[03:19:00]  Anyone.  The guy that killed his fucking wife in Lethal Weapon wasn't as pissed in any movie at anyone  as he was at his fucking girlfriend.  Yeah, but that rage that he's doing, you know, a day later, he's going to be like, I'm fucking.  All he's doing is crying out for help.  If you listen to that shit, all he's doing, all he's doing is saying, please love me, you bitch, and don't fuck me and leave me like I thought you were going to do. 
[03:19:30]  He sounds pretty lonely.  Yeah.  Like a lonely guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, this fucking play school water.  Tastes like shit.  It smells like fish.  All right, Mel, relax.  It does.  It's horrible.  We're drinking Aquarius Spring.  Aquarius Spring, man.  Look at this lame label.  The label looks like Woodstock, and it tastes like the water they were naked in.  Like, this is fucked.  It's fucked water.  Like it's a fundraiser for a grammar school, and they made their own water for the day.  I want good water.  Kenny, could you put, look at him. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, my God.  He jumped up.  I feel so bad.  Kenny, get, I hate this water.  But they donate to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.  That's nice.  Oh, isn't that great?  Isn't that great?  This water is shit.  What do you do back in Boys Town?  The water sucks a dick.  It's in a psychedelic bottle.  They're trying to make it seem cool.  You know, I never thought water, it smells like fish.  Open this thing and smell it.  Talk about bad pussy.  Smells like fucking fish.  It's only the way you just reached across and angrily grabbed my water with your fingertips, 
[03:20:30]  your shaky fingertips.  It's fucking mad.  Yeah, it sucks.  Wow.  It smells like fish.  It smells like fish oil.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I get so angry at bad water.  Wow, that's fucking weird.  I want good water.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, Danny, give it a sniff, right?  Right?  What's the consensus?  Smells like fish.  It's fish oil.  The fuck?  I'm going to drink that shit.  Fuck.  He cleans the palate.  He cleans the palate.  That nose doesn't need any cleansing. 
[03:21:00]  You should be able to fucking smell it from here.  Give it a little squeeze and get the air out of it.  No, no.  He just inhaled the water through his nose.  That's the purpose.  I don't smell it that bad.  No.  It's a little off.  That bad.  It's bad enough.  Your nose is green.  Can I have that cap?  I want clean, crisp, non-smelling, like anything.  When you say it's not that bad, I don't want any bad.  To me, it's faint.  Maybe I just, I'm not receiving it properly. 
[03:21:30]  It's bad.  It's bad.  It's bad.  You know, when I was a kid, we used to drink alcohol.  We used to take the cap off and throw it away and go, Caps are for kids.  And then we'd drink the whole bottle of peppermint schnapps.  Tough guy.  Caps are for kids.  The schnapps.  Nice.  We go, here's how we know how.  Hey, we did it earlier.  We're going to play it again.  Anthony, the Mel Gibson.  The woods, exactly.  Yeah.  Nothing better than drinking in the woods.  I love this.  Mel Gibson remix that Derek did today.  We're going to play it again because, you know, we're going to be out of here for the 
[03:22:00]  weekend.  Which one is that?  With Norton's mom.  Oh, that's a good one.  This one was great.  That is a good one.  Have you been checking out the Mel Gibson remixes that D-Boy has been making there, Bobby?  The first time I heard, first of all, I love the remixes on the show.  The fans and D-Boy.  All the people that are, I mean, amazing.  But this is the first one I've heard and I love it.  What, the Norton one?  I heard the one we just played.  I wonder how mad D-Boy is.  The remix that they just played before.  Yeah.  Which one?  The D-Boy one. 
[03:22:30]  What is he talking about?  You already played one, right?  Which one?  The one before.  He's got a lot of them.  Which one did you hear?  The newest, oldest one.  The one you played yesterday, but today.  All right.  Here's Norton's mom and Mel Gibson.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  It's fine here, but we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  What the fuck?  What are you going to say?  You're talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening.  What the fuck do you hope you're accomplished with that?  I deserve to be blown.  I spent more than $5 million. 
[03:23:00]  You know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  How dare you?  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs.  What?  What?  You could exercise, and you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  You fucking offend me.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just, I'm thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling.  Mom, you know right now, you don't care about anyone but yourself. 
[03:23:30]  It's you.  Don't get offended or think I'm strange, but I am a mother, and I worry about you.  Look at yourself, and look what you've done.  You fucking excuse for a mother.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway, I love you, and I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  Anyway, don't be mad at me, okay?  Sweetie, I love you. 
[03:24:00]  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  Fucking D-Boy, another one out of the park.  D-Fucking-Boy.  I can't really replace.  Star of the week.  Replace something he did.  He replaced, he plays a pussy with a dick.  D-Boy's fucking great, but what happened?  I think he sold his British Petroleum stock two days before they capped the well.  I was thinking of him yesterday when they announced they capped the well and the stock 
[03:24:30]  went up.  I guess the whole market's taking a little bit of a shit today, but yeah.  And I said, I sold off my Apple stock.  D-Boy, were you a little disappointed to hear that BP had...  Why would you sell it two days before they capped the thing?  Because I didn't know if they were going to cap it or not, because remember, they held  off on it for a day.  Well, they have to cap it.  I mean, if they don't, they have to get off this.  And they were really clawed.  Like, they were like, this looks pretty good.  When I decided to buy into BP, I was like, this looks pretty good. 
[03:25:00]  Like, I think they're capping this motherfucker.  And then...  It was a good hunch.  And then D-Boy's just like, ah, I'm selling, I'm nervous.  And then a day later, it's like, well, well's capped.  What's it at now?  What's it at today?  It went down a little bit, but the whole market's shitting.  What'd you buy it at, D-Boy?  I bought it at $36.88.  Oh, $36.88?  And when did you sell it?  I sold it the following day, actually.  It's at $37.50 right now. 
[03:25:30]  I only lost like $15 on it.  It's down about $1.40 today.  It's down...  It's at $37.38, but it was up as high as $39 yesterday.  Yesterday it went up a lot.  Yeah.  So, and like I said, the whole market's taking a shit today.  Yeah.  We're down, what, about 160 points.  But I see, I don't know.  I just figured, they gotta cap that motherfucker.  And the profits are retarded on it.  So, I was like, let me take a shot.  In my humble opinion, as they say, when you're putting signs up now in front of the guy. 
[03:26:00]  It says, show me your cock.  We're doing the...  But we had to write it backwards.  Danny had to write it backwards.  Yeah, it shows it backwards.  Why?  Because it's an alternate universe.  Yeah, that's why I told you to shut up.  Huh?  Before.  What?  Because people didn't know why I told you to shut up.  Huh?  Because you were talking about...  Cocks?  No.  That make you uncomfortable?  No.  What happened?  Dude, I want you to stand up again and show us the space between your belly button and  your fucking patch.  Wow, you saw that? 
[03:26:30]  Dude, it was like, it was almost hairless.  You don't have a lot of hair on your body, do you?  Oh, there's one.  Oh, there you go.  There's a nice one.  Nice.  You're getting your cock.  Nice.  Here we go.  Oh, God, guys.  Oh, that's gone.  It's gone.  Fuck, fuck.  Come on.  We're on the app.  What's the app called?  It's called iChatR.  iChatR.  Not fucking, not chat roulette.  It's iChatR is the best.  Taste test.  I bet you you can't even figure out which one is the bad water. 
[03:27:00]  Are you kidding me?  No, because don't taste anything yet.  I'm smelling.  No, get me two fucking paper cups.  Absolutely.  Fucking-lutely, I would be able to tell.  You trust Kenny to put water in two cups?  Kenny, take this bottle.  So what do we got?  Stick it in your ass hole.  Two cups.  We got Aquarius spring.  Jerk off into a bowl of spring, right?  And bring it in.  Yeah.  I bet you can't even tell.  I will just smell that fucking shit and know which is shit and which is good shit. 
[03:27:30]  What do you think?  I don't know the good shit.  It really is bad.  Don't get high on your own supply.  Don't get high on your own supply.  Oh.  God damn it.  Now I'm just sitting here fucking parched while we do a taste test on water on the radio.  Are you dehydrated?  Oh, I'm so fucking thirsty right now.  After a great week of radio, this is how we end with a water taste test.  We're so fucking lame.  That's the best part about you.  You know.  Exactly.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  We just putter out. 
[03:28:00]  That's what we're known for.  Petering out on Friday.  No, if you don't have it, you don't try.  That's the best part about this show is you're like, you know what?  Nobody's yelling at anybody.  We need content.  You're like, ugh.  What does it taste like?  They gave them so much good shit today.  Right.  They could just fuck themselves.  The whole week was good.  The whole week was good.  Today ruled.  D-Boy's remixes are amazing.  D-Boy.  Amazing.  Fucking day.  Mel.  Fucking.  Bobby Kelly.  It's been fantastic. 
[03:28:30]  There's our water.  Shut it.  Oh, Kenny.  Kenny.  I have to make sure it's dished out in equal proportion.  What is he doing standing there?  I don't know.  Did he delegate the responsibility?  This is an easy thing to do.  Kenny, did you delegate the responsibility?  No.  I told an intern to go get two cups from the kitchen double time.  Yeah.  They obviously have to be told and instructed what double time means.  Why don't you yell at Derek as he's walking down the long hallway? 
[03:29:00]  That's not double time.  Yeah, because it's not fucking 1942, asshole.  Shitty drill instructor.  Double time.  The fuck knows what double time means.  Put a little elbow grease into it.  The unoiled whale squeaks the loudest.  Fucking cunt.  Fucking old school talking motherfucker.  Yeah, these terms.  The early bird gets the worm. 
[03:29:30]  Does it?  Bobby, you want to do Homeless Roulette today?  What's Homeless Roulette?  Oh, shit.  Like the last one we did?  You know that guy's always out there?  That guy we talked to?  I see him all the time.  We got to find another one, though.  A new one.  Yeah, that guy was almost too normal.  Homeless Roulette rules.  We got to find the one that wears the lipstick.  Because we'll get some shit.  That guy's a scary motherfucker.  Oh, that guy.  He doesn't.  Scary.  Did you see the guy?  He starts yelling at you.  He chases you.  Did you see the guy who fucking does karate?  Where?  And there's an old...  Around here?  There's a guy who does karate, and then there's another guy on 8th Ave who just screams at women. 
[03:30:00]  Really?  He just walks up and goes, you fucking...  God, fuck you!  Mel Gibson.  You want to find one of these after the show?  Sure, let's find one.  All right.  Ant's doing the water taste test.  Are they labeled, or you know which one is which?  Oh, you forgot.  Just drink.  Why is one yellow?  First of all, I'm not drinking.  I'm sniffing.  Drink it.  You gotta taste it.  You gotta taste it.  It's not gonna do anything bad to you.  You know that.  Just gotta give it a sip. 
[03:30:30]  You have a 50-50 shot, by the way.  I don't think I do.  I think this is a trick.  Just taste it.  I would say this cup is the shit water.  Can I try, before you answer?  Really?  I would say that the cup in my right hand is the shit water. 
[03:31:00]  Bobby's breathing deep of the water.  Bobby can make a water...  Ant said this was the shit water.  Bobby can make a water taste test bit funny.  Yes.  I don't know why.  It's not a fine wine, you asshole.  He's drooling.  That's the first time I swallowed a load by accident.  This is the second time.  So what are you thinking?  I think it's this one.  That's the bad one.  All right, so Bobby thinks this is the bad one. 
[03:31:30]  I'll put the B for Bobby.  Right.  Yeah, that's fucking clever.  Kenny?  Yes.  Would you please reveal which one is shit water?  Which has the X on the bottom of the cup?  Mine.  That's right, Professor Anthony.  I could tell.  What?  You know why?  It fucking stunk.  I hate it.  Can I have my good water, Kenny?  Yes.  Thank you, sir.  Wow, you nailed it.  You did nail it.  Of course I did.  That water stinks. 
[03:32:00]  What a great Friday show we give them.  Right up to the end.  It's over, right?  This is great.  Thank you.  Did you fill this up with shit water now as a joke?  No.  That would be funny.  No, it's a new bottle.  Thank you, sir.  Are you practicing?  You're practicing for hard alcohol?  Exactly.  How to get it not to touch your tongue so you don't taste it?  Warm it up.  How do I get it to the back of my mouth without tasting any of it? 
[03:32:30]  So I can just be fucked up.  I'll get it right to my brain.  And sing karaoke on the internet.  Oh, my God.  Shut through the heart!  With Danny in the background with a bandana and a cowboy hat like Bret Michaels.  I was going to sing karaoke in my underwear last night.  You did?  Yeah, in my little tighty-whities.  There's nothing better than knowing that you're on live for the night.  Just to see the fucking degre...  Just the fuck...  Hey, who?  And then, yeah! 
[03:33:00]  Just fucking the cameras on the floor like the end of Blair Witch.  Fucking Danny's in the corner.  It's fucking crazy.  You know, if it's a Sunday, Monday's not happening.  You just hear...  You hear, all right, the best of...  Bobby, where are you going to be, Bobby?  I am actually...  I'm heading to... 
[03:33:30]  I just read, show me your cock.  Fucking asshole.  We have 900 show me your cock fucking things.  I'm going to be...  Actually, this coming up week, Columbus Funny Bone.  I'm going to be there Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Columbus Funny Bone, July 21st through the fucking 20-something.  I'm going to be there, so you can go to that fucking website.  Go to my website, robertkellylive.com, for the Columbus Funny Bone and the Philly Helium gig.  And my new podcast is up on my website. 
[03:34:00]  I do it from my iPhone.  Do you really?  I just do it from my iPhone, wherever I am, and I hit send, and it goes up.  It's the worst...  How fucking cool is that, though?  It's so simple.  There's nothing to it.  And you know how sometimes I add music to it?  I play music on my iPad as an intro.  You know what?  That's how it should be.  You are just a piece of shit.  And I talk over it like there's actually some producer producing the show.  That is fantastic. 
[03:34:30]  I slowly bring the volume down as the podcast goes on.  White Trash Podcast.  I have about a fucking $100,000 worth of equipment in a studio, and you are fucking doing it  and probably have 10 times the fucking viewers.  The one of Voss I have, I hope it turned out, he is such a fuck...  He wants to be famous so bad, because I'm talking to him on my podcast in Montreal at  a coffee shop outside, just randomly shitty questions, and he's trying to get deep, like 
[03:35:00]  it's a real interview.  Well, you know, I got...  Let me tell you this.  I mean, you didn't know this, but when I first started calling the chef, I asked you about  how do you like Montreal, you fucking dick shit.  I didn't want to hear about your life.  Okay.  First of all, there's no second of all.  It's going to be up tonight.  It's the most boring, and I...  If you don't hear me talking, it's honest to God, because I faded out like 90 times and  was looking at people on the street walking by. 
[03:35:30]  This is no way to sell a podcast.  That sounds great.  It's absolutely a way to sell a podcast.  I would so watch that.  It's going to be...  No, it's audio.  I'm a fucking alcoholic.  I thought maybe you'd do a little camera, too.  It's on video?  No, I just do the audio.  Oh, that sucks.  No, no.  It's...  Because you could do video, too.  You can do the video, but the video, you can't...  This is what's fucked up on the iPhone.  Yeah.  You can't email.  They have all the bullshit and the iMovie on the iPhone.  Yeah.  You can't email it because it's too big. 
[03:36:00]  You can't send...  The only way you can send a fucking movie, which is whack, is through MMS, through a text  message.  You can't email a longer than 30-second video.  I can.  Through Yahoo.  Dude, I can't.  I got to fucking figure out a way to do it then, but this is right on my...  I do as an app, a voice app.  Record it, and I put it right up on my website.  You know what I could do?  It's called Dude...  What?  If I wanted to right now, I could go on Ustream, which I use now for my podcast, for Live from 
[03:36:30]  the Compound.  I could go on Ustream and broadcast a show right from here, video.  Really?  And audio on my fucking phone.  It's not going to be like my fucking $10,000 Canon...  That's not what I said.  I didn't compare...  I'm not saying is it as...  I didn't say, is it as good as your fucking real podcast shit, Dick?  It's good enough, though.  All right, fucking second stepdad, Billy Magicton?  I'm saying, is it fucked up? 
[03:37:00]  Answer the question.  I'm just saying, is it good?  Is it good enough, or is it shit?  It's an iPhone fucking video and audio.  It's shit.  So, yeah, it's...  It's shit.  But it's video.  It's good enough.  Ah, fuck that now.  If you could hear and see a little bit.  Dude, the audio on...  I'd rather have a fucking great audio podcast...  ...than video.  And do you really want video of Rich Voss and me?  Exactly.  Yeah, it's...  Audio...  Come on, Bobby.  Audio's way better.  You need a little video.  I'll tell you why it's way better. 
[03:37:30]  You need a little video.  Is that you can...  You need a little video.  You can...  You need a little video.  You can...  You need a...  You can...  Video.  You can...  You can...  You can...  You do need...  You do need...  I know, because you have the OPI.  I'm not going to...  Nobody can do the OPI.  Dude, how about you shut...  How about you videotape it?  You know, it's a Radisson, so it's pretty good.  What the hell is this?  Cunt!  It's just a bunch of clips from Fargo.  Can you...  Can you do a little freestyling to end the week here on the OPI?  Oh, shit.  We need a new fucking rap.  You want to write down some thoughts? 
[03:38:00]  No, I don't need...  I don't need...  That's not the way I work, dude.  The blue waffle...  That's not the way I work, man.  Do you need a beat?  Nah, man.  I got my own beats.  I mean, if you got one, I'll fucking roll with whatever you got, but...  You tell me what you want.  This is your bit.  I prefer...  Freestyle and Bobby.  People love it.  I prefer...  I got to stand up, though.  People love it.  The other one...  I got to have the mic.  They love so much, they begged us to get another one for them.  I got to have the mic stand down.  See?  You know, it was like Feliciano.  You got no complaints.  You're right, Bobby?  You know, Bob Kelly, you got no complaints.  You want to warm up your voice, Bobby? 
[03:38:30]  First time in the US.  Give me a little warm up.  A little warm up.  I got to put my hands on both the headphones like a rapper.  Like you're doing We Are The World.  Do some me, me, me.  Get the voice fucking warm.  Yo, yo, yo.  What's up?  Yo, yo, yo.  Check it.  Check it.  One, two.  Yo, yo.  Yo.  Check it.  Check it.  One, two.  Yo.  Yo, Travis is in the booth.  Turn it up, yo.  Turn it up.  Turn up my mic, yo.  Yo.  What's up?  I'm Bobby K.  And I'm on the radio.  And you know it's going to be okay.  Because I'm here with my friend, Anthony. 
[03:39:00]  And Opie.  And Johnny, too.  You might not know him, but he's in the loo, taking a poo.  Oh, shit.  I didn't go there.  We're on the radio all week.  And you know you're not going to get attacked by a bear.  Because it's New York City.  We got no animals.  We got people who are criminals.  Yeah.  So, on the radio this week, we got Mel Gibson yelling at his bitch.  But that ain't no kitsch.  I said kitsch.  You don't know what it means?  Look it up.  Wikipedia that shit. 
[03:39:30]  Bitch.  Because that's why I say kitsch.  It rhymes with other things.  Like bitch.  I said it twice.  That's the way I do shit.  You know that.  I rap like a motherfucking mice.  My head goes back and forth.  My eyes are closed now.  I don't even know what's going on.  Because I'm a motherfucking clown.  Opie's in the house with sweatpants on.  You can see the tip of his cock down by his fucking ankle.  That doesn't rhyme with Frankl.  B. Roosevelt.  Motherfucker.  I'm in the house.  Don't laugh at me.  Yo.  You don't think that it's going to go?  Because the flow just keeps going. 
[03:40:00]  Even into the weekend.  Friday.  Saturday.  Sunday.  Back to Monday.  We're on the air.  This is the show.  We don't give a fuck if you don't care.  Because we don't.  This shit peters out.  Like you know I got the clout.  Shout.  Oh shit.  That I did it.  Like Missy Elliott.  I flow up and down.  And back again.  I added that shit in myself.  What's up?  I didn't say it.  But I said it.  Ding.  Ding.  Ding.  Anthony goes.  From his fring.  Fring. 
[03:40:30]  Fring.  He's in his pool.  It's 9,000 degrees.  And you jump in the jacuzzi.  It's like a fucking breeze.  He's fucking bitches in the pool.  And drying out their pussies.  And all of a sudden.  You say.  Cootie.  Where's that from?  I don't know.  But you look it up.  And that's why.  I don't even need an afro to rap this rhyme.  Make it all the time.  Pit it up at the fucking.  And lick up a dime.  I made that shit work.  And I didn't even know how.  But you know.  Bob Kelly.  I don't fucking eat cow.  I eat pig.  Oink.  Oink.  Oink.  And that's why. 
[03:41:00]  I fucking got a slinky.  That doesn't go down the stairs.  Only two or three.  And then I bring it back.  To you and me.  Because it's the Opie and Anthony show.  And it's just about to go.  Into the flow.  Of the fucking.  Motherfucking.  Starbucks.  Cup of Joe.  Holy guacamole.  Guacamole.  Alright.  Oh shit.  It's like.  Alright.  What do you say after that?  Big Kev. 
[03:41:30]  Get your plug in.  Because we've got to get the fuck out of here.  Oh damn.  We're out.  By the way.  Congratulations to Big Kev.  He got married recently.  About two or three weeks ago.  Betrothed.  Yes.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Yeah.  What?  What's that?  Cock?  You see it?  What happened?  It's a guy jerking off with.  There's a guy.  Show me dude.  Show me.  What's he doing?  He's jerking off with what?  Show me your cock dude.  Show me your cock dude.  Don't be scared.  Don't just show me your cock dude. 
[03:42:00]  Let me see your cock.  It's Eric.  You didn't know we're still on the air.  It's actually Eric.  Yeah.  He said O and A.  He's fucking a fan.  There's a fucking O and A fan that's jerking off with his cock.  That's who you know your fan base is.  It's fucking homos jerking off on eye chatter.  That's your fucking fan base.  You faggot.  You don't get to see my cock.  Jesus.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah.  Big Kev.  What do you got?  The show's coming back finally, right? 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Tomorrow night at midnight in the east and 9 p.m. in the west.  And what are you talking about this week?  We have an interview with Olivia Munn from Attack of the Show.  Fuck.  We've been trying to get her.  Yeah.  So that'll be exciting.  She's a winner.  Is your hair red?  Yeah.  No.  I hate her.  Do you have a redhead?  Are you a redhead?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  You're a redhead?  Strawberry blonde.  You're a fucking ginger, mate.  No.  I'm not a fucking ginger.  Did you used to dye your hair or something?  No. 
[03:43:00]  It was always that color?  Always.  Just really close to the light in the studio.  Is that why?  Yeah.  It's the lighting.  All right.  Stop.  Come on.  What's wrong with you?  I'm going to fucking jump over this table.  I will fucking smash your face.  Fight club.  I'm going to put my knee in your chest.  Like NAW days.  I want to take your shirt and hold your arm over and stick mine.  You know, me and Colin fought once in Iraq.  Really.  Legitimately.  Did you beat him?  Fuck yeah.  I fucking...  They call it the pit.  The Marines must have been laughing their asses off. 
[03:43:30]  Like two spastic babies fighting.  They weren't around.  It was 11 o'clock at night in fucking...  In Japan.  Yeah.  Okay?  It was called the pit.  And what they did is they took tires and chopped them up.  And put all the rubber down.  And that's what these Marines fought.  In this big rubber pit.  Me and him went in there.  Just me and him.  And we fucking duked it out.  I took his polo shirt and I put it over his head like a hockey player.  And I wrapped his arm over and I stuck my knee in his chest. 
[03:44:00]  But he went to...  Colin has rage.  I think he was going to stab me.  Like he was going to get a knife and fucking slice my throat in the middle of the night.  Well, all those kind of quote fake fights become very real when you're in the middle of it.  Of course you can't fucking fake fight.  Well, you know what I mean.  Like he's going to go, all right, yeah, I'll fight you as a goof.  And then the next thing it gets real and someone gets hurt.  Yeah.  I know.  It's fun, right?  Yeah, it is.  How about the guy who wins that has to apologize with a smile on his face?  Dude, I'm sorry.  I fucking...  I should have taken too far.  And that smile gets you going again. 
[03:44:30]  That alpha male shit burst in on the other guy who lost.  What the fuck are you smiling for?  Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have fucking held you down with your own shirt.  Fucking pussy.  That's great.  All right, we're going to fight.  Let's make a pact.  Let's do it.  We'll just let it happen.  Yeah, it'll happen.  Naturally.  One day, just fucking launch over the console or you fucking come flying out.  Yeah, me and Bobby got problems.  Yeah.  But this is the thing, dude. 
[03:45:00]  Me and you got problems.  You can't tell your wife.  You can't go back to your wife and go...  That kicked your ass?  That made me want to jump this fucking console.  What if I just grabbed the mic and started...  Like, something just happened.  I just started beating Opie with the microphone.  Wow.  Yeah, he'd be angry.  He probably would make me feel a lot better.  That's how fucked up I...  And he just started eating pie as I was beating you.  Oh, shit.  What if you threaten anyone on this show?  Oh, shit. 
[03:45:30]  Kenny's coming in now.  Let me tell you something.  First of all, you're a pussy.  If you don't call him off, we're not fighting ever.  I don't need Kenny.  Back him off.  Kenny just wants to hurt somebody.  That's why he's so mad that he's working for you pussies.  Because he's never going to get the opportunity to shoot or kill anybody.  He wants real problems.  Yeah, Jim Norton is...  What's he going to do?  To push a fucking 85-pound redhead away in Cleveland?  Get back, man. 
[03:46:00]  He wants to work for a fucking man with problems so bad so he can use his gun and his karate  skills.  He wants to work for a rapper.  Yeah.  A white rapper.  He just got so excited because he thought he might have the opportunity to push a fatty  around.  If you notice, Opie would not call him off.  Stop.  Who talked you out of violence?  Who?  Who?  What happened?  Was there a thing?  What does that mean?  Oh, yeah.  Thank God for Kenny. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, because in Dallas, I was going to fight.  I literally was going to go fight this guy.  He made me so mad.  And Kenny talked me off the ledge.  So, Kenny, if it wasn't for Kenny, I would have been in fucking jail or killed.  I would have been fucking, yeah.  Because I was going to go meet...  I had a whole letter written up that I was going to meet this fucking...  And I just, in the back of my mind, I remember Norton, he's always touting Kenny.  Kenny knows what to do in situations.  And I called Kenny and he fucking...  I was like, dude, this is what I'm...  And he was like, don't fuck, don't do it.  It's not worth it. 
[03:47:00]  If you go...  You know, and he talked me off the fucking ledge.  And he told me just to suck it up and be a real man and...  Be a man.  Yeah.  So, thank you, Kenny.  You're right.  That was good.  The same guy that talked me out from beating a guy up was just about to punch me in the  face.  Exactly.  He'll turn on you.  Why don't you take your own advice, asshole?  I know when force is appropriate.  How big are your pants?  Jesus Christ.  Your pants are pretty much up to Bobby's nipples.  Do you just buy them off the rack and throw them off? 
[03:47:30]  There's so much area in his crotch area.  Yeah, there's just...  He should always have...  What size pants are those?  Here's the problem.  Your body?  Oh, boy, here we go.  Your torso?  No, I need, like, a 52 long suit jacket.  But, like, they don't sell, like, suits separate.  So, like, if you get a 52 long jacket, the pants are, like, a 48.  So, you can't get them tailored? 
[03:48:00]  Go get them tailored.  There's Asian people all over the city that will fix them to your crotch size.  Yeah, for $2, too, by the way.  It's cheap.  You're wearing parachute fucking dress pants.  No, that's because I'm stealthy.  I can move.  That's true.  Yeah.  He's got to, you know, be able to move.  Yeah, why don't I split my pants?  I'm going to kick someone in the head.  Chuck Norris pants on?  With a stretchy part in the middle, you fucking jackass, which I did own.  And I split them because I was too fucking chunky.  Jesus Christ.  I don't like his thin belt. 
[03:48:30]  That's what bugs me.  His thin disco belt that he always wears.  Sam Roberts doesn't like it either, and I know he's listening.  Oh.  Sam was talking about how he doesn't like it.  Sam, we should wear your belt around his neck like a club kid.  You're going to make Sam wear his pants.  The fucking homo that he is should wear that around his neck would be dazzled Kenny belt.  As he's jerking off and has it tied to a doorknob.  Would you wear Kenny's pants for a goof?  Would I throw those on?  Fuck yeah.  For a Twitter pic?  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  Are you going to make him?  He's going to have to take him off.  He don't give a shit.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know if I'd fit in it.  I think Kenny's skinnier than me.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh.  What are you?  What waist is that?  48.  40.  48.  What waist is that, Kenny?  I hate that the elastic for his underwear, where the leg is, doesn't fit his ostrich legs.  He can also pull the pants off over his shoes. 
[03:49:30]  But look at his fucking legs.  The elastic is fucking loose.  Oh, that's great.  He's got a fucking...  Well, don't talk about any of that.  I was going to talk about that fucking vein on his shin.  Oh, it's got an aorta in his leg.  What the fuck?  Did you get kicked by a bowling ball?  What is that?  It's his legs.  Wow.  These pants are heavy.  What'd you get?  Did you get these at Brookstone?  Are they iPad pants?  It was a giant.  All right.  Danny, will you help me with that? 
[03:50:00]  Bobby Kelly is putting his...  Take your pants off, Bobby.  No.  He doesn't even have...  Oh, my God.  Look at how big...  Look at how big they...  He looks like Lou Costello.  Yeah, look at...  You look great.  You got to pull them all the way up.  I got it.  Yeah.  William Frawley style.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  All right.  See?  I got that guy. 
[03:50:30]  Ah, that's fantastic.  I got to get a picture of this.  Hold on.  I want one without the jacket first.  One without the jacket.  It looks like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder.  You look...  Yeah, you really do look horrible.  All right.  There we go.  And...  Perfect.  Oh, God.  You don't even look like you.  Now, with the suit jacket.  All right.  Completing the look.  You look like a dick bag.  Let me tell you something, you cocksuckers. 
[03:51:00]  My name's fucking Kenny from Jersey.  Listen, you fucking...  You don't fucking...  Norton.  Jim Norton.  His books are on sale.  You are a wreck.  I take the jacket off.  I got to get a picture of it.  Travis said it looks like the end of Big.  I wish...  Bobby, pose for a pick.  He should have suspenders.  Pose for a pick.  Here we go.  That's good.  The out of shape, in shape suit.  That's what I'm like.  Out of shape, in shape. 
[03:51:30]  Out of shape, in shape.  I love the 50s.  Hold on, hold on.  Turn this way.  Oh, no.  Get into the light.  All right, now turn this way.  You do look like out of shape, in shape guy from the 50s.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I got to go way back.  That is a wreck.  You fucking mess.  These fucking pants.  This belt is so...  A spaghetti belt.  Fucking Danny Terrio would wear this belt.  You look like Bluto.  That's great.  It's great.  All right, we've done everything we can with this show today.  I'm actually going to do that. 
[03:52:00]  Wonderful.  Bobby, what's the big plug?  Do you want to plug Twitter?  What do you got?  We got to go.  No, please.  Philly and Columbus, Ohio this weekend.  All right.  Honeybone this weekend.  This week coming up.  That's really confusing.  Not this weekend.  Next week.  Just go to robertkellylive.com.  All right, that's perfect.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Woo. </pre>
