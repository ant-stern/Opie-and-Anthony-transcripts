<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Sam Roberts hosting a "Worst of the Week" segment, focusing heavily on the upcoming Opie and Anthony bus tour to Austin.  A major point of contention was whether women would be allowed on the bus, with Anthony strongly advocating for their inclusion despite pushback from SiriusXM management.  The possibility of two separate buses—a "chill" bus for Opie and a party bus for Anthony, Troy Kwan, Roland, E-Rock, and Sam Roberts—was debated, leading to numerous vulgar and sexually explicit comments regarding the desired female presence on the party bus.  Persistent listener Bobo repeatedly called, begging for a spot on the tour and offering to perform degrading acts to secure it, prompting mockery from the hosts and a brief, annoyed call from female listener Barbara.  A bizarre segment involving a challenge to maintain dead air on the radio also occurred.  Several guests were mentioned: Mick Foley, Jeffrey Tambor, and Kevin Pollack.

The show then featured a sexually explicit phone call with "Bill" and his girlfriend "Lady Die," during which the hosts engaged in invasive questioning about their living situation, Lady Die's struggles with homelessness and alcoholism, and graphic details of their sex life.  Following this, the hosts discussed a gift sent to Sam Roberts by actor Kevin Pollak, who then called in to confirm sending the gift.  The conversation then shifted to Troy, Opie and Anthony's producer, who recounted an incident involving severe diarrhea resulting in soiling his underwear. This led to a call with Dr. Steve, resulting in a humorous discussion of bodily fluids and functions.  Numerous advertisements ran throughout this portion.

A subsequent segment featured the "Friends of the Show" podcast, "My Wife Hates Me," by Rich Foss and Bonnie McFarley.  In-studio guests included Mick Foley (promoting an appearance at Caroline's Comedy Club), Annie Lederman, and Jeffrey Tambor.  A lengthy conversation with Tambor covered his career, including anecdotes from *And Justice for All*, *The Ropers*, and *Arrested Development*.  The conversation frequently veered into sexually explicit territory, touching on Mick Foley's experiences with men possessing micropenises, his loss of genital sensation while driving, his childhood confusion about penis growth, and the hosts' and guests' sexual preferences and experiences.  A "Worst of the Week" countdown was also included in this segment, with Jeffrey Tambor winning the top spot.  The segment ended with a heated argument between Rich Foss and Bonnie McFarley about the paternity of Bonnie's daughter, escalating into personal insults.  Advertisements for Hair Max, LegalZoom, World War Z, Australian Dream cream, and Maui Jim sunglasses were also featured.

The show concluded with a discussion about Richard Voss's planned tattoo: a microphone strangling a woman captioned "It's not about you, bitch."  Voss defended the design as a humorous comment on hecklers, but the co-host and a phone call with Bonnie McFarley strongly criticized it.  The segment also included a recounting of a minor car incident involving Voss and the co-host (involving a flake of something described as a booger or dandruff), Voss's experience at a tattoo convention, a comparison of Voss's and DeRosa's tattoo choices, Voss's recent stand-up performance, a shout-out to Bob Levy, a story about Voss attempting to have a sub's bread scooped out at a gas station, a discussion of addiction and quick fixes referencing Bill Burr, and a story by Voss claiming to have heroically given a bloody, injured man a motorcycle ride home (countered by the co-host's tale of rescuing children from a burning church).  The segment was marked by frequent interruptions, arguments, and crude humor.  Numerous advertisements ran throughout this final segment.

[00:09:30]  partying non-fucking-stop i fully intend to be way back into drinking by then we're gonna have the likes  of troy kwan on the bus i believe roland who we know is a party animal yeah it's gonna be on the  bus i know e-rock he likes to up a good party yeah e-rock uh travis what do you think oh yeah 
[00:10:00]  you're gonna be hanging out and of course sam roberts who doesn't drink get the fuck on the  chipper yeah i'll be on that fucking bus yeah you'll be partying be rocking so hard you'll all be pebbles  barely sleeping just hanging out party maybe some fucking impromptu poker games going on  trail drive down whatever so he's gonna be on that bus chips looking at troy's dick again  yeah but here's the controversy we've been talking about the bitches yeah now this is a 
[00:10:30]  bus we're gonna be fucking going halfway across the country there down to texas if it's a bunch of dudes  drinking and listening to andrew wk it doesn't sound like a fun bus it doesn't right no until you add  the bitches the bitches bitches yeah yeah  and of course we know with a guy like troy kwan there will be bitches he brings the bitches one 
[00:11:00]  thing i must say when you look at his instagram or anything like that everywhere he goes bitches  he's just djing he's just playing the tunes and some bitch has her finger up his ass doesn't matter  right literally you know fingers up is that a true story it's a true story that's what i'm saying  now uh of course we stop at various uh cities and towns and uh we are national program there will be  fans uh if any of these fans are bitches oh yeah they're cordially invited to hang out with us 
[00:11:30]  absolutely for a little bit we're not going to be there long but we'll be there yep you know to hang  out well i overheard something that led me to believe that there could be an issue with the bitches  what i don't know let's just say what do you mean that someone and again this is like the irs  yeah and the department of justice and the benghazi fucking shit it's all this who knows who it is 
[00:12:00]  what where who signed this who talked what's that if you guys are just partying with each other and  no bitches yeah the meditation actually sounds cooler see but i'm hearing i'm hearing tell  that there has been an effort to kind of keep this bitches thing  out of the realm of possibility during this fucking trip someone's trying to curtail the  bitches no bitches uh and you know what i say fuck that yeah 
[00:12:30]  having no fucking homo to me i can't party with fucking bitches yeah  got it  there will be bitches on the bus there will be bitches don't make a  fucking maniac out of me the guys get bitches the guys get bitches and that's from paul anchor 
[00:13:00]  i ain't gonna fucking them guys down the hall think they're curtailing our bitches oh  and you know what what he won't be on the bitches bus what nope there will be a representative for  management on no not on my bus you won't have it not on my watch oh no not on my watch  why you gotta make room for bitches i'll cut off your sherlock nose and shove it up your  fucking ass not on my watch 
[00:13:30]  it's it's gotta be a married and an unmarried bus yes and i'm sorry i'm sorry everybody that's married  oh shit sam roberts i mean i don't i'm okay married to professional wrestling that's right  it's his first love my first love his first love because i don't think anybody with a wife  would want their significant other partying on a bus with  bitches exactly exactly who doesn't want bitches though that's a great question obviously a homo 
[00:14:00]  who wouldn't want bitches wait who's saying no women is kenny is it you kenny is it old chrome dome  oh who is it kenny i plead the fifth oh that's very popular thing to do these days  that's why i said that but you made a statement beforehand i know now you're in trouble i know  because call you back in for the horse yes you put the card before the horse you believe it's not  kenny's it's not kenny's rule it's actually uh radio wizard oh he's the radio wizard he's got to be a 
[00:14:30]  fruit the radio wizard oh he don't wear no suits well well yes he does oh gosh chipper  wait why is he saying no girls i would assume it's probably this again very overly cautious  liability thing which i don't even understand it's like if fans are there and they just want to hang  out for a little bit until we fucking we're off to the next town uh whatever no women on the bus 
[00:15:00]  yes bitches fuck that fuck that we'll videotape everything even the even the  fucking rancid sex can fans say there are hot bitches that are fans can they get on the bus  and come with us to the next stop i'm saying yes right now yes they can yes  bitches yeah yeah everybody and we're talking about shots of cum in the face yeah right 
[00:15:30]  for whoever for whoever but the bitches oh i can't i thought there were no bitches allowed  um we don't need uh we don't need bitches we don't need bitches on the bus  who are these bitches are they signed bitch releases  it's not a responsibility once they get to the other city of where the how they get to where  they're going they're adults right i mean they barely slow the bus down you kick them the 
[00:16:00]  fuck out and pick up new bitches right right guys yeah yeah  no bitches  you know who wouldn't want the bitches on a bus no who a fucking homo that's who  a fucking homo oh well we ain't fucking homo no we like bitches yeah 
[00:16:30]  roland what are you thinking bitches or no bitches step up  titties ass and booze yes all right so eros  there's there's some controversy on which bus roland will be ah but see if there's a married  and unmarried bus it's clear that he's on our bus right why well you would want to be like mellow 
[00:17:00]  no i'll bring booze i i can company sense booze and everything he said though that he might  want prefer the quieter bus but not yeah you have i'll go on the unmarried bus i'll tell you one  thing also there ain't no fucking enjoying the party and then oh i need to go crash out on the  other bus if you're fucking in for it you're in for the the long haul but as it stands only troy and  roland can be on the bus with you guys it's troy roland and jim and the bitches yeah four guys and a 
[00:17:30]  bunch of things with cunts running up and down the aisle that sounds fine to me exactly  i mean why why are you gonna bring a married guy on the bus and ruin the fun for everybody  absolutely me aunt and roland can just watch troy fuck all the hot girls  jerk each other off on a cracker  oh i think you're not mad we can watch all the girls we can watch all the girls  look over our shoulder as we're kissing their necks what are you looking at nothing oh and you know 
[00:18:00]  what lose out again that's also checking for you know wedding rings yeah that's how you keep  management off the bus they're all married oh good call that's a good little married to the job  right yeah it's not to the bitches i guess if we had to get stuck with one person from management  though who would it be if you could choose it's obvious yeah that's right i'd have to go rob don't  think he's even going really oh it's not so obvious then who would i want from management eric logan 
[00:18:30]  yeah that's a good choice right there from oprah's management yes who are the choices who's going  i mean it would probably be gary possibly steve that might be it yeah ross ross has been at our  other events yeah he's probably the least stiff yeah i think gary would just curl up like a cat in  the luggage rack and doze off i can picture him just sleeping yeah but it'd be great to get gary on 
[00:19:00]  your bus and then make him party he's not it's just if there's there's no party there no no no there  would be this underlying i'm watching for any problems thing we're having a good time yeah we're  having some fun we can have some fun guys we could let our hair down oh well but we could like uh you  know have some fun and then and then and then not not that kind of fun something happens look he  glares out of the corner of his eye just looking at you like you're like oh oh and listening to 
[00:19:30]  the bitches talk like who's that guy he's creeping me out he's looking at me who's dad's here yeah  right who's this whole thing up i've seen that guy in the movies isn't that nas for a  nas for a toe or something they get the vibe that he didn't want the bitches right right they pick up  the vibe he's cock blocking us just by being there yeah so he's not invited you guys we don't need  that on our bus right yeah be like hanging out with the fucking dog from davian goliath yeah just 
[00:20:00]  poking his head what are you doing with the bitches wait so it says so the one bus is aunt  jim troy and roland yeah and then the other bus is everyone else obi sam travis eric kenny management  just everyone yeah everyone right yes if they want to play the game sorry yeah and nobody  fucking twisted your guys arms to get married absolutely a bunch of hot girls running around 
[00:20:30]  on our bus perhaps a couple of girls people aren't quite sure right the price of admission on our bus  the ability to have fun right and the uh uh ability to not fucking stop other people from having fun  so that gets you on the bus if you can't do that move it along get your ass out the kitchen next bus  down my friend right right there's a whole bunch of no fun going on down over there i think lady die  should be on your bus she likes to oh she's not married yeah she's not married and she likes to 
[00:21:00]  have fun and she's a bitch yeah fuck that yeah that is not what i mean we could charge admission to see  her see that we could put up a sign that says for 25 cents meet the talking slug lady  i'm not a slug lady of course you're not that'd be a great way to turn it around though to be like  okay well there's a whole bunch of freaks that listen to this show that are not married they're  all going right oh boy no no there's gotta be a rule no dude no dude fans yeah what no dude fans 
[00:21:30]  because because the whole entire fans the everybody would be on the fucking bus no no dude fans on the  bus just bitches yeah you guys gotta take bobo yeah no no way he likes to party no way so the only  men on your bus would be the four of you yeah right that sounds great it's perfect it's perfect all right  and the bitches plenty of bit now i thought bitches were not allowed  uh only if you're a homo if that mo down the hall wants to quay off and queeb with his friends

[00:32:00]  but then you just ask to be on the bus trip what what do you have to what are you calling in for  uh that's what's calling in for to say they'll do just about anything just about anything well how  about you name something one thing that would be entertaining all right just about anything would  be how about you you stop tweeting about us obsessively  okay see this is the bobo we get right when bobo calls up the after show we get the energetic 
[00:32:30]  back and forth he's laughing he's singing songs he's fucking doing and here's the bubble we get  okay i don't know well i'll i'll also be a be a prank calling just about every  one of my relatives at ridiculous hours at night what why why would you do that to your family the  only ones that really give a fuck about you for the for the for the show you only know it's a prank  call because they hang up on you if they didn't hang up on you you would just talk 
[00:33:00]  well bubble great phone call i appreciate it who loves you baby  when i really will do anything to beat i don't care no one cares this isn't  this isn't 2001 2002 oh you'll leave cares you'll even what  eat mr maloon again dog shit what for what so we so you do that and then we have to deal with you for a  week on a bus don't worry i'll behave all right all right you'll eat mr maloon again's dog 
[00:33:30]  shit yes i will why would you do that this would be a part of that trip  why do you want to be part of that trip part of the trip so badly that you'd eat dog  shit volunteer to eat dogs kenny was telling me the other day that we're all going to be  hating the bus trip uh two days in yeah and we're all going to realize what a horrible idea was we're 
[00:34:00]  all going to be kenny could you book a flight back for this asshole of paradise here uh where are we at  with the bus trip uh no yeah i heard you guys uh talking about that yeah yeah yeah we we found out  that um gary's trying to downplay the gary said don't encourage them he truly doesn't understand  what we do huh no bitches in his mind what is what does he think is going to happen i don't know  i don't know because he told troy kwan not to encourage us yes as far as the bitches go 
[00:34:30]  so in his dumb little mind what does he think is going to happen well ant had some theories as  to why he would have said that because he's a fucking homo  but why but doesn't he understand that that just makes good radio and of course and the reality in  the end is we're going to be pretty fucking sad and lonely on those exactly on on the those buses  in between fucking stops doesn't he understand that apparently not oh what was that oh it was a 
[00:35:00]  terrific phone call today yeah all right i really want to be part of that good appearance it's  really great though when i heard about that bus trip i want to be a part of it now that lady died  is back what the fuck it drives me nuts this shit it's just fucking what i want what i want  and fucking just listen to the radio show what's wrong with you yeah you you uh should be proud of  all the great bits you gave us over the years and now i think you go back to just kind of being a 
[00:35:30]  listener stalker patty went back to kind of just being a listener but she had a an amazing run run  she had a great run and we bring her back every once in a while we catch up with her  but back in the day she gave us a million bits you're probably a pest lady die is back so that  bobo role is kind of that's true lady i've been i've been trying to be back for a long time  yeah yeah i really want to be a part of that bus trip i'll do anything i'm i'm even going to 
[00:36:00]  celebrate my driver's license by following that bus if i have to oh you got a driver's license  oh i'm working at getting on it i got the owner's permit you have zero shot at getting on this permit  the same way that fucking he he drives in the fucking driveway slow on sunday  you guys  jimmy is so  fucking annoying here's why i'm irritated with bobo yeah because time and time again we have 
[00:36:30]  fucking told you the same shit and you still give your password away you still just babble at  people on twitter it's like you can't stop being an ass it's like just cut the shit already  you know what i mean i don't mind if you tweet me once in a while hey how you doing  but you know okay just want to be on the show how interesting is that to read it's not  bobo comment trying to help you i'm afraid they won't be asking you you guys on twitter like that 
[00:37:00]  again we've gone through this already time and time again you still do it i've i've said this many  times over the years i i don't understand like what bobo hears when he listens to the show stalker  patty here's when she listens to the show and lady die what she hears when she listens to the  show like how is it deciphered in their weird brains i don't know how are they such ridiculous  over-the-top fans of this show i don't know it is astounding though is it just a tone that just 
[00:37:30]  happens to oh you think it's just some subliminal thing some just some tone in one of our voices that  catches their attention they do yeah and that's the real reason why they listen because they don't  really listen to the words it's light fm to them this is light fm to them you think absolutely because  you're right they never laugh never bobo's never come on it when that was fun it's this desperation  like we're a life raft in a sea of fucking of nothingness and bobo i'll tell you this much i mean  you know i if if people want to follow us as we do this bus tour we're not stopping anybody so 
[00:38:00]  look if they have if they're penises and balls if they have breasts they're not welcome to follow  us so i mean we can't stop you from following us if we do this bus tour but you're not i could i  can guarantee you're not gonna oh god i can guarantee you're not going to be on my bus i don't think he  should uh take his driver's license uh if he gets one uh and the first thing he does is take some  cross-country trip no i think you should practice a little yeah yeah oh well i got i got a friend 
[00:38:30]  of mine coming with me who mr maloonigans no who i'll just say a little friend of mine in queen  let's just say a friend of mine let's just say yeah but no one knows doug in queens  of course not oh there's a million dougs and queens hey you went through another twitter girlfriend  huh just whatever whatever right right right i'm with that why are you incessantly hassling somebody 
[00:39:00]  else on twitter hi i love you oh i gotta ask you you realize these girls don't like you at all and  they're just setting you up and you you fall for it every single time right yeah somewhere in your dumb  little brain do you do you understand that yeah i do that's why i'm done with that yeah you're  finally done with that done with it huh cool yeah all right thanks for the call 
[00:39:30]  i'll do anything to be a part of the book we heard you the third time you said it repeat it again  yeah no no yeah exactly you want to get on the bus you'll do anything you should say that again  because we didn't quite get it redundancy is good at least at least for one at least for one stop to  the other uh at least and then what happens we could drop you off in the middle of nowhere  yeah oh yeah i i got relative that'll build me out and get me back 
[00:40:00]  i just want i just want a piece of that well it's up to anthony if he wants uh you're on his boss we  can't say no oh yeah throw it on me i already said he's not on my ball so it's up to you  what was not married and it was made clear there's a married and a not married bus oh boy  we'll behave all right i won't be a burden i promise oh jesus i'm like this phone call yeah i  i really promise i won't be it won't be a burden all right all right take it easy bobo it was a great  phone call good appearance i guess you got your point across i think all right we really consider it 
[00:40:30]  anthony you're right well it's on me now consider what i don't even know no being a part of the  plus oh of course that will you have him on the bus yet what the bus trip will you have bobo on your  bus well you know things have to be looked at litigation is a problem yeah it's post facto  maybe it's corpus say no did you want to apologize to jimmy because i think you kind of pissed him off 
[00:41:00]  today bubble oh and i'm very sorry jimmy you're right right we really guys really guys they want  to be a part of this bus oh my god so you say you're sorry and then you repeat the same  shit again right but i i really we know we heard you you don't have to apologize just stop repeating  yourself thank you for the call and what would you do i we don't even know what you would do 
[00:41:30]  well well for one thing i'd probably be drinking i'd probably be dancing on the bus  drinking and dancing on the bus on the bus yeah and and i'd be enjoyed and i'd be enjoying all the laughs  how does that help our trip you're enjoying the laughs yeah we want people that are going to like 
[00:42:00]  enhance the trip or yes help the trip maybe i'll even bring in the new character called boston bobo  we're not going to boston oh my god yeah well i'm sorry jimmy in advance but we have to ask  he's an alter ego yeah oh well can we hear boston bobo yeah i heard you what the  is wrong with you  that this guy just wake me up 
[00:42:30]  just wake me up  i'm not wired  see that's it now it's just  that's the only reason to do this i hate boston bobo i hate him  but but jimmy is disgusted but i think his character is supposed to bring out hate in  people so i think bobo he did a great job yes does boston bobo sing the thunder buddies song  fuck you thunder you can suck my dick you can't get me thunder because you just got

[01:27:00]  about him on the air this is great he heard me too he knows who i am just so you know kevin pollack  knows who i am so you should too but it's not about me it's about kevin pollack on the worst of  the week countdown well i i have to um uh present a box oh oh what's her name ah a box yeah i i think  this has something to do with the paul anchor fucking what thing oh jesus christ oh there's a few 
[01:27:30]  buttons i got i got a box a box another gift a another gift another gift all right i didn't  actually i only opened up like the card and then i said i gotta save it for the radio that's a pretty  uh large box remember the paul anchor thing of course paul anchor because he was on our show he  sent me um a decanter a crystal decanter and crystal glasses yes and um the note just says can't believe 
[01:28:00]  sam thought it was me enjoy your gift i believe you want to guess enjoy your kid oh wait you really  weren't you weren't here that day so you're not gonna be able to guess i uh no i wasn't here that  wait were you here for the opening of the paul anchor gift though uh that i wasn't yeah yeah yeah  oh then you should be able to guess wow it's a big square box it's about it's a huge yeah tiffany box 
[01:28:30]  that's a big tiffany box so it's gonna be more nonsense it's uh i got a lot of wedding gifts man  because i'm re-fucking wrapping all this shit is that about 14 inches cubed it could maybe 12 it's a  box that could fit eroc's head easily oh wow yeah right that is a big box do you want to guess  tiff a blue tiffany box well the note gives it away can't believe sam thought it was me enjoy your  gift that's from the day i opened up the paul anchor thing you weren't here when you opened up 
[01:29:00]  the paul anchor thing because that's when we also called barry williams oh shit oh yeah oh yeah i was in  the car you're in you were in route so okay that's fair enough all right i know who i thought it was  i got a gift that day and sam guessed who had to be from because i said it was from a celebrity  didn't i say that much yes a celebrity right colin quinn no no when when shop at tiffany's what's wrong 
[01:29:30]  with you of course not what the hell worst guest ever um a celebrity yeah it's another celebrity  gift obviously it's all based on the fact that sam thought it was him the first time so he decided i  better send a gift now he's obviously done the show oh this isn't from paul anchor no oh no it's  so weird if it was another paul anchor gift yeah the paul anchor gift leads to this because we thought 
[01:30:00]  the paul anchor gift was from the other guy so the other guy said you know what fuck you  you know i can't believe sam thought it was me anyway enjoy your gift oh dr steve no celebrity  well that's what i'm saying but a celebrity would have to be listening to the show to know that  dr steve gave me a very nice birthday with justin stangle and a uh i think it's a hundred dollar amazon  card very nice thank you he's a nice man anthony bourdain no uh should i just give it it's not that 
[01:30:30]  big of a deal but kevin pollock yes oh it is kevin pollock yes oh shit yes because the day when we  were trying to figure out who sent me that uh that gift sam goes what'd you say exactly i said it's  gotta be kevin pollock he's the only celebrity who listens to the show right on a regular basis  turned out to be paul anchor so the card reads can't believe sam thought of as me enjoy your gift so  now he's in con i think huh i think he's at the con movie festival there oh is that close

[01:37:00]  cash in and i don't know this is old school wedding gifts i'm starting to get from people do you think  that i have no room in my house for this a lot of thought went into this i appreciate that there  i was like what can i get ah a refresher set yeah but he's annoyed look at his note can't believe sam  thought it was me enjoy your gift like he felt like he had to send something well i feel when we  realized it wasn't from him what if maybe it's time for stifler to send a gift now yeah he listens 
[01:37:30]  sometimes wait who are our regular celebrity listeners let's strong arm them and have them  send fucking wedding gifts gifts let's call them wedding gifts they're wedding gifts when stifler  came in here he had legitimate favorite on a bits right stifler listens and tom hanks's son colin  hanks colin hanks he's a regular what's his name dana dana's a listener dana white when he  listens oh he's got tons of cash yeah he's got a lot of money a lot of money a lot of money a lot of money  dana a lot of money does mcfoley listen on a regular basis he's coming in today he is but 
[01:38:00]  he's not the most tech savvy guy but maybe he's generous he's not generous cheap i know but maybe  he could stop at a mall on the way just pick up a little get me a like a platter or something from  a kiosk right some dumb platter would be nice stop by one of these gift shops stores on the way  here some kind of like cheese platter like you know display thing yeah yes  yes yeah this is a great this is a great thing we're starting can you get rid of that fucking 
[01:38:30]  thing thanks oh my god it's it's too big where am i gonna put it i'm with your dining room do you  have anything dining room oh the fuck's wrong with you i thought maybe that you had like a side  do you got a sideboard in your dining room i'm lucky i could push toys away and then find a place  to lay down and sleep at night a dining room oh my god that is a lot of glass to have like out when  you have kids around too right yeah when you're having people over how great would this be should 
[01:39:00]  we get some fresh lemonade and do it up nice today yeah or some iced tea like duck dynasty you should  have a like a silver tray that you bring it out on with the iced tea and go everybody some iced tea  i'm gonna set up a registry for all our celebrity friends i'll put that on there it's an ona show  registry registry uh because for some reason i'm getting wedding gifts four and a half years later  that's great though he put thought into this yeah but i keep going back to the note he was strong 
[01:39:30]  armed and and was forced to send a gift you honestly think that he heard like sam say that and was like  oh this guy now i gotta yeah because we were talking about how he listens all the time and sam  guessed it was him and then it turned out to be paul anchor with a handwritten note all nice and stuff so  here's his note can't believe sam photos me enjoy your gift he didn't even sign it oh wait how do we  know it's from him oh well that's who i thought it was oh my god i just assume there's no name on it 
[01:40:00]  at all no that's how annoyed he is god whoa so wait a minute that's how annoyed he is oh you're just  guessing you didn't imply that it was somebody else but sam only mentioned that one person but nowhere on  the gift it does it say uh kevin pollack oh i just think it's kevin pollack yeah what about it what  if it is dr steve no it's not dr steve could be dr steve yeah really he's weird but sam you said i 
[01:40:30]  did say kevin you might have said dr steve in that moment too but i probably also said dr steve what how  did you say it did you go oh i bet it's from kevin pollack or you and oh here's a gift from kevin  pollack opie said who do you think it's from and he was giving hints he said it's a celebrity  and i said i know kevin pollack and opie goes why would kevin pollack be sending something  and i said he's the only celebrity that listens to the show uh it's probably kevin pollack then 
[01:41:00]  return department parsippany new jersey but then there's like it doesn't matter if you order it  online and then says a story of boulevard third floor east elmhurst yeah it's all online yeah  that's just a warehouse but it doesn't say that it's from kevin pollack now that i think about it  no fucking hint whatsoever maybe it's pen gillette pen gillette he listens to the show right  uh i don't know if he does i i think his uh his whole crew does he's very busy he is busy 
[01:41:30]  he's getting fucked out of celebrity apprentice exactly oh being uh-oh  oh is this kevin pollack kevin pollack calling hey hey kevin how are you buddy are you in france  i'm at the can film festival uh very cool this is very cool indeed it is what's going on i saw  pictures of you on the uh red carpet there did you now yes i did i i follow your twitter 
[01:42:00]  yeah i'm here with the uh oh i'm here with uh the film that uh starring jerry lewis i play as a  strange son a little uh family dysfunctional drama yeah i saw the picture of you and jerry lewis  pretty cool that is very definitely especially in france yeah you know jerry lewis love him  they love him in france he's royalty did you send the uh the tiffany gift i don't know what you're  talking about here we go we're gonna have to do this i don't know what you're talking about well 
[01:42:30]  there's no no one i got this wonderful gift and i can't we're assuming it's you because the card  says can't believe sam thought it was me enjoy your gift right so sam uh mentioned to me and something  else no we got hope he got a gift from paul anka but he didn't tell me who it was from he said it was  from a celebrity and i predicted that maybe kevin pollack was the one who would but you predicted  it in a shitty way let's be honest you got the guy in the font so you should be honest it was more  shitty about this you were hinting that he might have been a little needy and then that he sent a 
[01:43:00]  gift or something i said kevin pollack is the only celebrity who listens to this show okay fair enough  that's that's sort of uh my answer to all this is how many fucking times do i have to say that i  listen to this show not only did not only did sam suggest it as me but uh i put opie on the spot who  thankfully said i love kevin pollack i don't think this is from him but no he does listen  and then opie you went on to say of course now he has to send a gift because we've called him out on it 
[01:43:30]  oh oh i didn't hear that part okay well that is backing him into a corner yeah  no so i listened to it and i thought well this is a perfect opportunity to continue this right  and then so then i'm thinking well now it has to be a classy paul anchor company yeah  it was i was thinking you know i'll send that edgerman things i fucked up the first time i was on or  whatever and then you know then i thought i'll go the paul anchor route so i hope it i hope it 
[01:44:00]  worked and made you laugh a you made us laugh and b i you know in the end i absolutely appreciate it  i have to say dumb things on the radio but in the end i absolutely appreciate it and it's not a bad  fucking gift no and uh that's a great gift right there tiffany uh you put your iced tea in there you  got six nice tiffany right the blue uh and a tiffany blue glasses right great i'll tell you it's more  it's more for your wife ultimately for the housewares what have you but uh in keeping with the joke it 
[01:44:30]  just kind of seems perfect no it's funny and and the card is so you i can tell you just annoyed  can't believe sam thought it was me enjoy your gift yeah why didn't you fucking i think i wrote  enjoy your fucking gift didn't i oh wow look at that i guess tiffany doesn't uh appreciate the  blue language so they left out the fucking part oh they like the blue boxes yes yes that it kevin how  did you mess up the innermans the incense i went to three different stores before i came in that  morning and they didn't have the exact one that you wanted and i said fuck it i got it can't go empty 
[01:45:00]  handed so i just grabbed one of them and i believe the quote was yeah this isn't the one  this guy this guy is in con he's in con hanging out with jerry lewis and he has to deal with our  coffee cake demands what a life take a photo of the of the 47 200 foot yachts that i'm literally  looking at right now wow really because it is the perfect juxtapose to uh enjoy your 
[01:45:30]  fucking gift yeah have you yeah it's amazing uh the usual suspects uh premiered here in 95 and uh  that was ridiculous and spectacular and uh yeah it's it's it's a surreal sort of uh salesman hocking  their wares when you boil it right down but then it's set in this stunning beautiful ridiculous place  in the south of france so it's it's a felini movie i mean it's ridiculous it's absolutely  ridiculous every aspect of it and what do you do when you're not doing the whole red carpet thing 
[01:46:00]  over there is there's a lot of drinking a lot of drink okay that's what i was getting at it seems  like it's a big one big no i mean it's a lot of parties and stuff with a lot of idiots who are who are  who are uh very pleased with themselves uh and everybody's in tuxedos thinking they're james bond and of course  no one is of course it is the bullshit capital for two weeks it really is there's nothing but  horseshit going on yeah yeah and you can smell it right oh god is it reek yeah they're not even 
[01:46:30]  hiding it over there no no no and it's a european smell so it's that much greater oh boy yeah yeah  hey were you close to that what was it a shooting or was that before you got there oh the i was right  before i landed uh the christoph waltz press conference somebody shot off a fake gun i think  yeah yeah yeah he was just tackled i guess and then there was also a jewel heist over there  well there better be because that's that's actual news that'd be awesome yes yeah there was an actual 
[01:47:00]  jewel heist well you know this again i'm going to send you this photo there are a hundred hundred  foot yachts that i'm looking at maybe only 50 but it's absurd amazing stacked up side by side so  there's gotta be half a billion in jewelry at this in this small little town right now sure man  you know what if i were an international jewel thief this is certainly where i would be we all follow  you so take the picture i'll just uh retweet it okay you know right now i'm serious i'll be right 
[01:47:30]  now it really is absurd that's why i would do it oh that's funny disgusting display of wealth  yeah absolutely right yes and a wonderful gift from kevin paul yes better than the paul anka gift  my second celebrity gift i believe did did anka come in yesterday is that what it was yesterday well  then i i uh i had uh i had to go do a funeral in rochester i think that was paul anka day so i  think we we missed out on the return visit of paul anka but he'll be back as sam roberts has  pointed out because he doesn't have much else going on i i believe is what sam said i think 
[01:48:00]  he's fantastic and been great on the show and it actually kind of annoyed the shit out of me when  sam was busting his balls to be honest with you he gave us a great hour i didn't say he really did  and he's he's of a dying breed i mean him rickles jerry lewis these guys they're not much of them left  right you know they're true old school yeah and so whether it's kind of hokey and whatnot to sam i can  appreciate that but uh maybe you know have a career of your own first oh nice you just got a 
[01:48:30]  fucking shot right there that's right i'll tell you from kevin paul yes kind of an honor exactly yeah  i mean a little game of tennis right now that's all yeah no i mean if you if you hung with sammy and frank  who else was in that one i guess dean yeah yeah yeah i think when you write the song my way you want  your balls busted by a sam robinson that seems wholly appropriate but thank you very much for

[01:54:30]  parasite issues here on the countdown number three troy shit the bed no it wasn't luckily it wasn't  in the bed it was just it stayed contained inside my did you roll over on it was it flat i was laying  there i just it's like a potato waski it's something something something felt moist back there yeah huh  it just felt like i was like oh man i should probably go white back there i don't know what's going on oh  man and then when i i lowered my my underwear i was like there's a there's a dump you thought you 
[01:55:00]  just needed to wipe a little well i was kind of out of it i was i was really tired oh wow and then  and then i had to take off my underwear and then wash them out in the sink yeah you know what i mean  were you in bed with your girlfriend yeah holy shit did you smell no it didn't smell how does it  not stink i mean if i would put my nose up to it it probably would have smelled but it luckily  didn't smell up the room and we have an air purifier so that probably helped did she notice  no she's she's she's knocked the fuck out she still doesn't know no she she was texting me she's 
[01:55:30]  like you feeling okay i'm like i didn't say anything oh maybe she said you're feeling okay  because she knew maybe but i don't think she did i think i pulled this one i pulled the one and you  didn't just throw your fucking underwear out you washed that what did you do with the walk me  through this you wake up there's shit in your pants i want a fucking not minute a second by  second take the underwear and then you drop the load off into the toilet what did it did you kind  of like you kind of go like this and you push the load on its way and it drops into the toilet 
[01:56:00]  like you're like you're telling something to scurry off yeah just a little like skedaddle a  slight scary like you'd kind of yeah yeah loop get gravity going and then that thing rolls out of the  underpants into the toilet bowl and then what you do then you take the remains of the underpants and  you wore shit out in the sink using the palms of your hand to get it all good well that would be  the case if it was solid and then oh no and then oh then you just hose it down the fucking uh sink  and then you throw it into the regular laundry it didn't leak out of your leg holes between 
[01:56:30]  no underwear luckily i don't know how i was positioned it just kind of first stayed stayed contained and then  i just washed it on the sink and then i had to let it dry for a couple hours wait wait so so like  solid chunks of shit were falling in your sink and going down the drain it wasn't there was no crust  to it no it's it's liquid man and there's like it seems like there's like fibers oh my god you  know what i mean like those are worms yeah nothing is staying solid fibers are probably worms that's  very unhealthy i don't it's not good did you drag your ass on the carpet like a chihuahua 
[01:57:00]  was it itchy oh my god little worms yeah so then it just washed out and i let them dry out for a  little bit and then i had a i position they're in my closet right now they're still drying but i  washed them out real good and then that way because i don't want to throw them in the laundry  basket until they're completely dry your girlfriend wouldn't open your closet no she doesn't go to my  shirt wait why can't you throw it in the laundry before they're completely dry because if they're  if it's still wet you don't want her to know that you were washing your underpants out of the sink 
[01:57:30]  wait i wouldn't leave them out like that because you would wonder why my underwear just sitting  there like it's all mildewy if you put wet laundry under other laundry and just kind of sits there  and you never know there could be a little residue on there that you didn't notice until it dries out  yeah i just rather just be completely dry yeah that way it's just like flaky it'll just flake off  damn yeah yeah it was bad i was talking about yeah so yeah there's something there's something  seriously going wrong in my guts are you gonna go to the doctor i'm debating whether i should or not

[02:01:30]  is this phone call isn't about you sir we're trying to help uh uh troy kwan okay sorry buddy uh  troy what are the odds he has a parasite because ever since he came back from mexico he's losing weight  and you haven't runny shit in general there yeah yeah oh boy yeah he had some ice in there uh in mexico  uh some ice ice baby yeah most of those uh place uh hold on man we're digging on the ice ice baby 
[02:02:00]  for a second oh my goodness i know right all right turn it down sorry all right just don't mention ice  again okay and then we'll be forced to do this oh so what happened but most if you were hey troy were  you at a resort yes okay most of those places will ultra filtrate the ice that they use so that's  not okay what'd you say i told you not to say ice damn it all right yellow and espanol but the uh 
[02:02:30]  they so they will ultra filtrate those things it's most of the time the fresh fruits and vegetables that  you're eating at the resort that's going to give you the teresa so uh the teresa if you come home  uh with diarrhea for a couple of days and it resolves then it was probably a bacterial or viral  teresa but if it persists more than about five days it's most often is a parasite oh my god how long 
[02:03:00]  has it been troy kwan i got back last monday oh oh geez that's that would be a week what kind of  parasites are there dr steve and describe what they do  more than single-celled uh creature that can live in your g.i tract and multiply and eat the food that 
[02:03:30]  you eat and eat your and give you uh inflammation of the uh of the intestine which causes the loose  stool stuff loose stool yeah why is it called a stool dr steve well because they're very interesting  not really uh story behind that but when the kings had privies back in the middle ages uh when they  learned to actually shit it you know in a different room from everybody else they would happy they would 
[02:04:00]  have a stool and they would say oh the king is at stool and because they would sit because everybody  else was squatting and just shitting on the ground uh-huh hit or something right so he would actually  sit on a stool and they would say oh they could the the regent is at stool and that would mean that  he's you know but these assholes couldn't figure out that maybe they should be sitting too  they're just shitting all over the place as the king figured out how to shit properly and why 
[02:04:30]  wouldn't they say at the stool or on the school why just at stool oh i don't know why do they say they go  at hospital instead of at i hate that whole thing i think i have to go to hospital oh oh i i i i'm going  on holiday all right exactly and then prom oh we're gonna go are you going to prom you're not  it's the prom am i not going to the prom oh you might be going i'm not going to the prom

[02:08:00]  first a little words of wisdom did you piss in a lake no oh my god you got one of these fishes up  you got a fish in your dick i pissed in the ocean oh that's oh no in the ocean that's where they live  no they live in lakes no you got one of these things up your people you got a fish in your  water and they live in the uh amazon what is it about piss holes that they like so much  especially it could be the temperature gradient or they may actually be following a chemical gradient  of urea for whatever reason that they're attracted to that and they'll just swim right up your 
[02:08:30]  cock up your rea heap remember them this was this was your rea heap it used to be uh uh felt that  this was a mess easy lemon yeah that guy uh uh the river monsters guy proved that it was uh actually  true so trade you have a warm piss hole i do oh you know what that means fish like it in there  dr c what happens if i just ignore the ignore it and just don't just go with the weight loss 
[02:09:00]  and enjoy it yeah it's um your your body might be able to clear it over time because people live  in these areas and they survive but um it would be a real impediment to your lifestyle over time  especially like i'm assuming you like girls girls don't like guys who shit in the bed  uh that's true you know you might want to take care of it so you might leak out your legs next  time oh gosh and what they would do is they would you would shit in a cup and they would look at it 
[02:09:30]  under the microscope a thing called a stool for ova and parasites and when they do discover which  parasite it is and they would give you a uh uh a medication designed to kill just that parasite  wow what have you done now could it still just be a bacteria yes it's only been a  a week so i'm saying you know if it goes longer than five to seven days then that's when you start  yeah but he's shitting himself at the tail end of what this is supposed to be no pun intended 
[02:10:00]  right it's the eighth day and on the eighth day troy shit his pants  and he said it was good dr c what happens if i have flaggle or uh flaggle rock comment flaggle  fl fl fl will yeah flagel flagel flagel well that's why you have a box marked flagel and you don't  uh shake it up too much so stupid it really is called trichomonas oh trichomonas is a vaginal 
[02:10:30]  parasite and it will also have that yeah how's your bag he's got that on his face right the vag is okay  you've had a lot of you've had a lot of sand in it lately yeah oh oh shit punch him in the face  please oh damn what is that parasite and how do girls get that oh flat oh that's a horrendous  parasite it makes uh a yellowish frothy custard discharge from the vagina ah it's like a monster 
[02:11:00]  go ahead and uh and google google image that one that's a good one uh dr steve has the best google image  uh suggestions uh flag flag flagel flagel is the drug that's it's metronidazole it's an antibiotic  and it kills uh uh anaerobic bacteria but what's the thing we're looking for yeah trichomonas t-r-i-c-h-o-m-o-n-a-s 
[02:11:30]  trichomonas yeah and just look for uh the discharge oh jesus oh  what is it it looks like a watered down mcdonald's vanilla shake  it's on a vagina it's bubbling too oh it's horrendous wow i don't think you should ever  under the microscope because you're not expecting to see a monster under the microscope this is 
[02:12:00]  horrendous looking do you see monsters under the microscope yeah that's gotta be cool as  shit legs and they're jerking around and stuff it's really kind of holy shit tiny monsters inside troy  oh my god are you coming up soon i'm hoping to come up in june sometime so why don't you bring  your microscope i want to check out monsters under a microscope that is so fucking sick that i have  a microscope bring it up you know what that looked like it looked like fidel castro was uh  doing the part of um mia wallace oh ding in the uh when she was vomiting up for five dollars shake 
[02:12:30]  troy is your ass down for whatever is it asked that apparently what do you mean well i'm wondering  if it falls into the category of down for whatever that you're shitting the bed if it means that  there's going to be a penis going into it no it's not down for whatever if dr steve wants to examine  something in my asshole yeah dr steve you haven't uh shoved your fingers in anything in a while 
[02:13:00]  no it has been a while no troy's never uh had that treat so we could uh scoop some fecal  matter out of his can we really yeah all right troy you can't take care of this issue until like  he's a parasite i'm just saying theoretically we could do that he needs to take care well you want  troy he can mail you some of his feces he could smear it on a little index card and mail it like it  said in my underwear or yeah you want to you should sense dr steve your underwear i'll drop off troy's 
[02:13:30]  underwear at the lab they'll appreciate just take a dump directly in a box and just write dr steve's  address on it just might get complicated just send them a box of shit yeah it's got to be a bag  would you get in trouble with the post office oh my god if it was addressed to a doctor and it's just  leaking through the bottom you don't do it proper like not leaking but the cardboard is a different  color a little more oily like when you leave the pizza box out all night the worst of the week

[02:19:00]  in studio to promote he's going to be at caroline's comedy club uh next sunday so a week from right now  he'll be at caroline's comedy club annie letterman very funny comedian has no relation to david her name  isn't even spelled the same she was in studio along with us and uh opie jim and annie all try to make  mick foley feel uncomfortable so why wouldn't you listen 
[02:19:30]  can i show up on one thing about my show i you know we've talked about the cursing issue before  right i've got it down to where i only swear i drop one f-bomb but it gets a standing ovation  are you trying to hurt my feelings no i'm just saying different people work different  here's i got it down to one word that's not the effort all right you know you want me to tell you  why this is boy i didn't see that coming i'm gonna drop an f-bomb for you guys okay i very rarely do 
[02:20:00]  this uh but it was that lady in australia uh the first time that our bodies became one she just looked  up at me and looked me right in the eyes and she said and i was hooked uh why are you gazing into my  eyes while you're telling this for unknown reasons too intimate and then she later said she just kind  of wanted to dangle it out there she didn't want to overdo it and she wanted to see how i reacted and  i was i was hooked i was like a guy with his first taste of uh some type of see if she wanted that 
[02:20:30]  reaction out of me she would have to say like i wish i wish your cock was black and then i would  just i would just come on her leg like a dog  it is fun being friends with you jimmy because i know like if i like do something if i have a  threesome or i fuck a guy with a giant dick i'm like jimmy's gonna be so proud like i can't wait to  tell him i'll be very happy for you mick you have a micro penis it's a it's an irish penis uh 
[02:21:00]  you got an irish penis redheaded what any that's a callback because annie uh told a nice story about  fucking a guy with a micro penis yeah by the way i got a text from a woman i went twice a woman i know  uh i'll just say she's from atlantic city and she's a cop and she texted me i was so rude to the guy in  the micro penis store she had a guy like that she said when i touched it with my hand i actually  looked at him and asked what is this and i said really and she goes yeah i was drunk and put my 
[02:21:30]  hand on his pants he had been trying to sleep with me for a while so i was literally surprised like  really this is what you brought and it didn't end well and she i told him i had to go to the bathroom  and i snuck downstairs and left oh my god how great is that good for you he was aggressively pursuing  a cop she handles guns but it might have been before she was a cop yeah why would i have to give  a literal answer to that she's kidding did it say anywhere in the story that uh this was a male  a female cop what's that does it say that it was a female cop oh yeah oh yeah okay female 
[02:22:00]  cop excuse me you want to tell that other little story that you told us during the break or yeah  i'm not ready to yet i want to yeah but i just can't wow is this what it's like you just egg him  on like this no i have to though sometimes yeah a couple of stories i won't tell that one he's got  a great story he'll tell eventually that's the beauty of the show eventually it comes out it just feels  too cruel can i you want me to tell my story about a micropenis on a cop and micropenis my micropenis 
[02:22:30]  story involving a cop okay okay all right someone's like put your hands up all right and this is on  camera how drunk were you when you were driving you ever have one of those days when you're driving long  distances and all the uh the compiled uh injuries you've suffered uh nerve damage lower back they  combine to create the loss of sensation so you can no longer feel your genitalia as you're driving  you know those days absolutely i would love that happens to the best of us and then i and you  literally although on one level you know it's still there you can't feel it and so i got pulled over 
[02:23:00]  for speeding because i was reaching down to make sure my penis still existed and when i got pulled over  and i was asked why i was speeding i said i can't find my penis and that was my excuse so i got off  was it there it was there it was kind of tucked away it was uh it was scared it was hiding your  dick was like in a fucking like a shame curl under your fucking ass cheek taking a nap are you going  crazy you know is he going crazy no this is a true story you're driving and where would your penis go 
[02:23:30]  you left the house with it what could it be it just you lose the sensation if you've if you've  dropped elbows on concrete for for 20 years and then i just momentarily couldn't find it and i'm not  scared you like you might have taken a walk i put my foot on the pedal i got pulled over and my excuse  was i can't find my penis then wasn't a lady cop she just reached out she's like here it is or he let  you go we had a huge and we had a baseline that came in that would do they still have baselines in 
[02:24:00]  uh porn yeah not so much yeah i always thought that i had a i have a twin brother and when i was a kid  i always thought i wasn't gonna grow a dick it was like really confusing for me i couldn't understand  i kept asking my mom how my dick was gonna grow in  it didn't i don't know why that's just a very that's we all looked at that story and like  you we know you're serious and there's something really interesting about that no no one knew where 
[02:24:30]  to go with it no we were actually fairly i just we used to like bounce on the bed after back after  we would take baths and just we had a song like it would be like i have you have a penis i have a  vagina and we would just sing that but i just never got it that's a story that i could like hug you for  or i could just go home and jerk off to either option is acceptable i think i was mulling over those  options in my mind too because i was realizing that i'm looking at a beautiful young lady who's using the  the word dick and grow in the same sentence and i'm just feeling are you a dirty talk i can't believe 
[02:25:00]  you think i'm young thank you you are young you're not a dirty talk guy i do like it but i like it  sparingly so that's why i rarely use the words in real life that way they take on a greater meaning  when they're when you pull them out what turns you on when a woman says to you um you know i do i do  enjoy my wife uh dropping the occasional f-bomb as long as it's occasional is it but is it saying  is this tough room mick tough room today huh yeah but she's turning on me is it no i'm on your 
[02:25:30]  side i'm on your side is it like oh me or i fucking is it like an aggressive thing or saying like oh  or any woman doesn't be white but is it is i want you to fuck well no it would have to be my wife  but i mean in general i'm not trying to ask i don't you know you know what it's it can't be used it has  to be used as a verb you know it can't uh okay like when i watch uh like you wouldn't turn you on 
[02:26:00]  if someone just said you know like the girl that just sits on the point is oh f yeah f yeah is using the  word incorrectly you know it's got for you for your purposes for my purposes gotcha so uh i don't  know if i feel comfortable getting this uh intimate with you guys about my intimate that's fine  interesting but is it appropriate for santa claus to ever use the the f word no no brings it back  around to you want to know here you want to know about traumatic events all right okay can i just say 
[02:26:30]  that i'm fully scared of you all right okay you will be and i'm going to use one here and this is  why i don't go there very often because you never know i remember that uh the movie with john travolta  is the attorney where he said you never actually ask a question unless you know the answer and so you  know when you really say that he should practice that as massage therapy fucking experiences sessions  yeah exactly so just fucking going for it 
[02:27:00]  well in uh in the late 80s when i was in texas and i was on my brief six-month run that i would  have to live vicariously through for the rest of my life right the memories you know i actually thought  i invented the phrase tell me what i'm doing to you tell me what i'm doing because you want to hear  that word and then this texas girl goes you're fucking me i reckon and it just no kidding took  the you're fucking me i reckon the worst of the week countdown all right we're at number one here

[02:30:00]  recognize it's the ropers oh my uncle used to play this when he tickled me let's talk more about that  i think that's a whole hour right there oh it is and we got that hour remember that norman  felt dancing with the plunger i love my norman we used to go to lunch uh the day of ratings on on  tuesday the ratings would come out and there would be this sweat on his upper lip because i think the 
[02:30:30]  deal with norman was after a certain number he couldn't go back to three's company right and um  um that was that norman was an intellectual did you know that no oh yeah did you mick i did not  know that wait why couldn't he go back to three's company after a certain number of episodes um contract  oh okay yeah those were different days how long did you guys last i think we did two seasons i didn't  think we would do one season i i just said i'll just do this and and and i i didn't know anything 
[02:31:00]  about television i i knew nothing but i had i had so much fun get this the same year i did the ropers  i did and justice for all oh wow  um and so there there it is i mean wow the same act it does the ropers and okay yeah that's showing  a little range huh yeah which by the way as you were talking and as you talk about the ropers and  norman fell i was thinking of your monologue in injustice for all when you go to pacino's house  and you're drunk and fucking earl soames did it again it was so nervous such a great first film 
[02:31:30]  i didn't know what a mark was i didn't know i didn't know anything i didn't know what i'm oh  there's a thing called an apple box yes and if you go out of frame you know i had a uh my first shot i  had a um valise and i kept going out of frame and the guy said do you want to uh to put that on an apple  do you want an apple or a half apple and yes i said no thank you i'll wait for lunch  and that's when they knew i'd never done a film i didn't know what a mark was that's unbelievable 
[02:32:00]  that would have been so that would have been a great joke though what if you could have played  it off like you meant it oh your uncle called by the way what did he say uh he said just come on over  tonight he's dead and that's why i killed him self-defense really yeah because it was really  it was very because it took him a long time to say that um what was your question i just  no question i just think that would be that would have been a good joke you could have played it off  as a joke which one he said i'm waiting for lunch oh no i was too nervous you know my father told me 
[02:32:30]  always ask a question i was too nervous thank you what do you mean always ask a question i adjusted  jeffrey's microphone if you have a question like you say are are we on are we on uh tv or are we  ask a question but i was always too nervous too i was always too proud you know yeah and you got to ask  you know i i mean i did not know that when you do a close-up that they measure it with a you know i 
[02:33:00]  i didn't know any of this stuff thank god for al pacino he just took care of me yeah yeah he knew  it was your first film everybody  have you have you done anything as fun in a movie as throwing those plates down the hall  how much fun was that you know in the baltimore uh courthouse there's still chipped marble oh  really yeah because i threw real plates and i went there the day before and i was uh i was a 
[02:33:30]  very different kind of actor than i am now i i i i rehearsed too much i i went to the theater  three and four hours before the performance i uh i was not uh i was not improvisational i was uh i  worried a lot so i was i actually ruined that movie which is a very very fine movie with worry i can't  watch it really yeah don't worry that's a great movie the only thing i didn't like about justice for  all is the music i thought the music choices were a little weird like uh certain movies have weird 
[02:34:00]  music are we asking you for your no not at all i was really weighing in no no i was only segwaying  back into how good you are okay what is some of your opinion have you read any good books  what you're thinking it was coming back to how great you are yes i was just using it as kind of a  springboard back into your wonderfulness to get back to how great you are i'm trying to remember who that  was because it was a very very big composer yeah yeah yeah jeffrey hated it too i had a problem  with the movie too but i'm not sure i want to bring it up oh my god don't bring it up mick 
[02:34:30]  it's uh seeing john forsyth in uh bondage gear after knowing you remember that how great was that  charlie and blake carrington and i was in bondage you know what i did not know i didn't know what to  do on your day off um because uh and i would just go to the set i did not know i did not know what  to do with that energy you know it was just very weird can we look up was that weird for you to be

[02:44:30]  weigh 270 pounds wow yeah you look good thank you what are you down to now uh 269  i can't do this great am i yes yes what was your uh uh what was your mankind or just let me ask you  this sure is the wrestler not one of the great movies of all it is a great movie great it's a great  movie and did he not nail that i walked in skeptical and i and i i reviewed it for for 
[02:45:00]  slate.com they wanted a wrestler's take on it and i walked in not wanting to like it within 10 minutes  i was like this guy he's not doing an imitation of anyone but i've seen this guy there's so many  shades of guys that guy he's not if you want to see something you must and i was there and he did it  you must see his acceptance speech at the golden globes no independent spirit awards okay it is  the funniest foulest offbeat most wonderful speech i've ever seen okay wow what what an actor this guy 
[02:45:30]  is you know uh you know chuck zito right well of course i've known chuck from just being around but  chuck's not the guy who calls me at my house and i got a call from him one night and he was like hey  it's chuck zito hey chuck how you doing i got somebody who wants to say hello to you and he put mickey on  the phone because i was the first wrestler that he'd gotten feedback from that wasn't involved with  the film yeah and he was just really grateful that i thought that he'd he'd nailed it i mean i loved  it because he played a real person he didn't play a caricature of a wrestler he just played a real guy 
[02:46:00]  and a father and you know just a regular struggling guy it was good i hadn't i liked nine and a half  weeks when i was a preteen explains a lot about you that was my first uh spank shall we say and uh  um and so to see him i mean he definitely changed physically but it was like the perfect role for  what had happened to his physical appearance when you um uh when you uh do you now have physical 
[02:46:30]  ailments because oh man what do you got he's hurt bad uh yeah i actually his first time i called delta  as i'm going to columbus ohio and it's first time i ever requested wheelchair assistance bad back day  today i got out of bed i was like oh this is not going to be a good day i had a very uh physically  punishing uh style that i chose when i was 19 that no longer seemed like such a good idea when i  hit my 30s not staples i hope everything everything yeah yeah he's missing an ear yeah 
[02:47:00]  are you yeah let me see really see jeffrey tambor wants to see the missing ear right i got to show  you the the good one first there's the good one beautiful yeah why are you missing it uh it was one  of those moves that didn't work out like i'd hoped uh you know i got caught up in the ropes and uh in  germany ropes a little too tight and uh you know when i pulled out of the the ropes and i'd had my  ears injured before so when i was was down on the mat i could see the blood dripping down pretty quickly 
[02:47:30]  and i thought jeez you know the ear is mostly cartilage it's not likely to bleed back there  and we had this unique situation because our two english-speaking referees had been sent home one  because of knee injury one due to a death in the family we had a french referee who was unable to tell  us that he had my ear oh he couldn't just show you you know what you mean and it all goes by there's  a grainy there's some footage on the new dvd like a handheld from germany and he actually hands it to 
[02:48:00]  the uh to the ring announcer can be seen like literally running to the back with it and we kept we kept  wrestling that's what i'm gonna watch when i go to bed now and uh and do you want to hear a story and  this is i was talking to the guy that's jeffrey tambor i don't often i don't often drop an f-bomb  but i i will hear and you have to preface this but i have to preface this by saying booker t is a  tough dude in the world of wrestling he did some time in jail and he's written about for armed robbery  and he got into wrestling tough guy and he was on his first overseas trip with uh with the group i was 
[02:48:30]  wrestling with and he said when i walked in this is his first glimpse of me i walked in i just lost  my ear and i said i walked in and i said i think i just lost my fucking ear oh bang which was the catchphrase  and booker t said he was in the corner going i'm not sure this business is for me man yeah  because you're kind of on that like adrenaline rush that's what happens after you've been injured  like you come down after that but you're a young man are you 40 40 almost 48 jeffrey thank you yeah 
[02:49:00]  yeah so appreciate that young so yeah you look good appreciate that and now i i know people come up to  you and say there's always can you say there's always money in the banana stand uh young man came up to me  in the in the airport the other day and i i said uh you want what you want a picture he goes i just  want you to do something oh my gosh well-dressed handsome he said you have to say there's always  money in the banana stand i said that's it he went yeah i said there's always money in the banana 
[02:49:30]  standing and he got all emotional and walks away so we're talking about a fan base here  that is what is that what is that from the rest of development and our pal patrice was in that  scene yeah what is with you here's my special request without any exaggeration i'll do it we have  referred to my son mickey whose nickname is pickle as the holiday pickle meister since since uh the  grinch so if you would utter the words this year's holiday cheer my something along those lines just 
[02:50:00]  say what's the line i think it's this year's holiday cheer meister we did it perfectly but  i'm this year's holiday cheer meister but i thought you were gonna ask me for you know because i have  another one that they shout from uh uh taxi cabs do you know what it is what is it um mr soames did it again  they said they'd be fine they'd be professional but that's fine um do you know what it is we do not 
[02:50:30]  know hey now oh yeah oh yeah yeah that's the one yeah so i have hey now i know and i have there's  always money in the banana stand what's hey now from come on i was just kidding  uh larry sanders show larry sanders show and now my favorite hank kingsley related line was  actually uttered by henry winkler and the larry sanders show where the hank kingsley porn tape had  leaked out yes remember that and then uh henry winkler the fonds links over to larry he goes 
[02:51:00]  he goes so hank's got a tape out and larry's he's really upset about it and the fonds goes  i hear he's got a huge cock though you know what's the problem what's the problem henry is  responsible for one of the biggest laughs i've ever heard when we were at the dga screening of  arrested development and if you remember from uh when he plays my lawyer yes yeah yeah of course he uh  mitch had him do this take uh in the bathroom where just before we leave he looks into the mirror and he 
[02:51:30]  does the the the take uh as barry zuckerhorn but he does the fonds take uh with the hair  and the audience went these are adults right they went crazy  that is that is by the way the nicest man yes we say that all the time yeah no he's the real deal and  i keep looking for the wink like he's an ass yeah right but he's not doesn't happen no he is nice he's 
[02:52:00]  almost too nice he'll anything that's what we say yeah yeah he's been on the show a bunch and we  just feel like there's something that we just don't i know i don't understand about it i actually  heard his feelings we were having lunch once and i said um you're bored aren't you because i can't  believe i'm looking at my the publicist from carolines where i'm doing a show on june 1st sorry  in the middle of a jeffrey tambor story about henry winkler he's a man who deserves an explanation  and that's why i gave the thumbs up and the date huh yeah i ask about your ear and you do the thumbs 
[02:52:30]  up for carolines what are your roots what are you where are you from i don't my where are your parents  from my mom was adopted and my dad's mom was adopted but people speak um russian to me yeah you  look yeah and when i'm in if i'm in greenpoint frowning they speak polish yeah yeah yeah you have  that you have that uh um sad eastern european no no you have a slavic beautiful slavic face thank

[02:54:00]  when i went on stage uh uh carolines wounded ward no no carolines gonna be great okay and uh and i  literally said i went up there you know broadway you get like ten or eight or nine ten good comics  amy schumer was up there and then judah goes on and judah kills and i told the guys from wounded  warriors hey i used to do some comedy if you guys want me to come up there and they called me up  like okay mick foley and then i went up there and i proceed and i tried to change my set because 
[02:54:30]  people were already using you know references and at a certain point i just said if i was in a pool  i'd ask for a life preserver because i'm drowning up here what the audience do you know when i came  back judah judah's there he goes dude a few things first of all you never come out of a crowd when  you're doing a set now i guess he goes also man don't think this the wrong way but if most comics  go up there and don't get a laugh for four minutes they're dead but they were at least listening to you  and then he said i might want to actually have some jokes in my set oh but i remember that feeling 
[02:55:00]  just that helpless feeling of being up there and i mean i'm a guy that had been in front of 20 000  people many times and you can feel like get them in the palm of your hand and now you're in front  of 200 and you're just so you felt guilty basically that you had further depressed wounded warriors  there i've had lower but that's the one my lowest moment was doing a bounce commercial in new  new york i'm a new yorker uh and i couldn't do hey my socks don't cling correctly because my hands  were shaking so really badly and the executive producer yelled from the back of the shooting

[03:15:30]  two or three times and hard shut up you fucking pussy listen to me right now okay listen to me  right now you started off i know who her dad is and then i knew you were gonna frame it as i was  joking so i joked back a little bit right yeah then you said how did you know and you know let's play  that back if you knew how to fucking work that computer we'd play that back right now and you'd hear  your voice and the anger that you had in it i didn't have anger yes you did you know what he 
[03:16:00]  looks like because you really think it no i don't think it and quit pointing at me because you make  me so angry i can't i'm not having this conversation stop she's gonna be six this summer really six  years why don't you just take the fucking test and put it to rest you know why you won't do it  because you don't want to be proven wrong no what are you trying to sound like what's his name that said  that it's i was the one who first said it and then he picked up on it but it's the truth all  right relax no don't tell me to relax don't bring this shit all right and then say oh relax all right 
[03:16:30]  i'm sorry i made a mistake you know everybody write down what day is it today what day oh what day is it  today um may 20th yeah let it be noted that at 4 26 on may 20th what richard voss said he's sorry  yeah now say you're so now now no i will i will not apologize but you've hit me more i've never  hit you once in my life i've never hit a girl and you've hit me how many times hard one time i almost 
[03:17:00]  cried shut up i almost cried remember when you punched me in the jaw then i would that would have  been good we would have all been assured that you're a real person oh i'm not a real person i don't have  feelings i don't think so you think oh i'm like a robot oh unless you make fun of your being jew then  your emotions come out for say something about your sexual prowess then your emotions what word my prowess 
[03:17:30]  what did you just say your sexual prowess do you think anybody has any idea what you're talking  about you come up with words you come up with words i didn't make it up anybody who's read two  fucking books in their life i've never i've read a lot of books i've never read that word yes let's  let's determine what a lot is at least probably 40 books okay i don't know for 50 remember all the  books i used to have no i don't when you first moved in okay all the books on that bookshelf what 
[03:18:00]  happened to them we didn't throw them away in after the fire did we i believe so oh no not all my  books not the sammy davis book acting books every book that i had that i read from in there you said  i never finished it you're are you i've read so many books so many gangster books hot house prison  books yeah anything with what boy on boy sex in it so i go to the tattoo convention 
[03:18:30]  and i think one of the reasons i went and this could be self-centered i'm already done with this  podcast all right no let's rejuvenate i'm sorry shake my hand no shake my hand i don't feel like it  shake my hand and why did you why don't you tell them why i wasn't gonna hit you in the car but why  you thought i was what you did why don't you tell them i was rubbing my nose oh really why don't you  you like to be truthful when it's negative against me but when a little flake fell on my 
[03:19:00]  jeans and i really no a little like yeah and i flicked it off on the floor okay first of all  it was you yelled at the top of your lungs first of all she's in her nose i go can you please i wasn't  in my nose i was going like this i go can you can you please stop picking your nose in my new car  and then she goes there was nothing nothing i was just touching it then all of a sudden she shows  me this big ginder no it wasn't okay ginder nobody knows where did you come up with this stuff 
[03:19:30]  ginder you're making it up so you gotta make it was a tiny flake it wasn't a tiny flake it was  very visible sitting on her pants it was like the size of a of a goldfish scale  listen to me whatever i could see it from the drive  and then she tooks it and tooks it took took it and threw it on you grew up in the ghetto folks 
[03:20:00]  we gotta leave a little slack there on the english and threw it on the floor  anyhow i flicked it on the floor big deal why not pick it up and throw it out the window i couldn't  pick it up it was too small it wasn't too small then how could you flick it picking up a piece of  dandruff the ugliest so i and i think one of the reasons i went to the tattoo convention do you think  this could be true to see if i would get recognized do you think people do that kind of stuff do i do i  think you do it yes and did from being on a tattoo first of all i know for a fact because we walked 
[03:20:30]  into dunkin donuts uh earlier about an hour ago and a man who was pretty heavily tattooed opened  the door for us and rich immediately started talking about the guy's tattoos so the guy would  talk to him about his tattoos and i heard rich say within literally i'm going to say 40 seconds of  their conversation i got mine done on tv and the guy goes on tv wow okay so yeah i'm pretty sure you 
[03:21:00]  went there to no i was i mean is that what your career has come to that you're like i was on a  tattoo show no i just like a regular person no we were we were introduced as comics everywhere i go  people go let me see your tattoo how many people watch that dumb show i watched two or three do you  know what my mom said last time i talked to her on the phone uh yeah because she told me seven times  but tell the people your mom said no no i'm not going to no you got to tell them this is what your mom 
[03:21:30]  said it's kind of it's kind of mean she goes oh my neighbor saw rich on that tattoo show i go oh i  was on it too she goes hmm they did say something about that yeah like that why won't they give you  any accolades i don't know what accolades are accolades yeah yeah i don't know why they won't they  refuse but they they have a hard time giving it to you also to be fair i only realized that later so  it makes me feel better that we're both in the same boat with them so i'm at the tattoo show and 
[03:22:00]  i come up my tattoo idea and i was talking to these tattoo artists from chicago that were pretty cool  they were they were pretty fucking done up and uh i have a great idea for a tattoo and they loved it  and the idea is is like on stage is a microphone it's a microphone and the arms are coming out of the  microphone strangling like a girl in the front row you know that won't shut her mouth you know and 
[03:22:30]  then you write on you know a little writing it's not about you bitch and the microphone is is strangling  the girl in the front row which is and i said to you that's a great idea i tried to determine if  you're a joke kicker dot no i had like no i'm serious i'm like how many people did you tell  well and you said only one which few well here's and you go it was a tattoo guy and he loved it 
[03:23:00]  he loved the idea well i know that i love that you take though people's things like when people  are face to face it's easier to say yes than to say no like oh yeah it's good well i had but you  don't know like on facebook here's ray wagner whipped something up real quick he drew something  no so you did tell somebody else who do i tell i told obviously ray wagner well i put it on  facebook i said no i didn't say that no i had to get a divorce well i might have said i didn't say  for a tattoo i just need a picture but this is what he drew up real quick but that's not 
[03:23:30]  that's the mic choking the girl with the mic cord it is so horrendous after we put this up you have  to like tweet this so people know it is well i'm not gonna this isn't the one i would use i know but  it is even worse than i thought it in my mind's eye what a microphone i i thought is a little  more uh artistic than that i guess okay look there's it's it's so crazy i can't even explain it's like 
[03:24:00]  it's like so that when you have a heckler you just pull up your sleeve and show them  nobody just put the hours of the club on it too oh keep your cell phone remember to turn your  cell phones off put that on your other shoulder just anything people you can put a  thing of your cd buy my cd you won't if you do this right you won't ever have to talk on stage  again no i wouldn't show it to the people like people do it's the worst tattoo idea ever oh i 
[03:24:30]  guarantee if people can see this tattoo i'm gonna put it like a tattoo of a dog pooping and then the  owner not picking it up and just be like it's your job bitch no no you don't when people get tattoos  they're personal literally what what they like yeah but who would who would like you're saying  the fact that you're saying it's not about you bitch you're putting that on your arm you're making it  about them permanently on your arm no yes yes oh i might not even put that writing i might just have 
[03:25:00]  the microphone could you not see how ridiculous it is are you crazy and then he goes to me why it's  not hacky no because nobody would ever do that are you kidding me nobody would ask a million people  no a million would say that is a horrendous idea a microphone choking choking in the front row  oh my god yes because you know how like it shows these girls don't shut up they want all the 
[03:25:30]  attention this and that okay i'm gonna get tattoos uh must be over 18 to enjoy the show  it's not to show the audience it's my own personal i understand but it's a ridiculous  it's first of all it's negative what do you mean it's negative it's not hateful yes you're hating  that person who there's no complete description of the face basically what you're saying and what 
[03:26:00]  you would really the positive flip side to this tattoo is it's all about me but you can't put that  on your arm it is when you're on stage it is about you it is they came to see you so shut up it is about  all i know but that's what you're saying you're saying to an audience member shut up so you're like no  heckling that's your tattoo basically is no heck yeah shut the fuck up yeah yeah so that's why i'm  saying that's a ridiculous no i wouldn't write no heck no heckling is a better tattoo yes no no yes 
[03:26:30]  not that i'm believe me i wouldn't i don't think that's a good touch like if you had said a snake  coming out of an apple if you could have said anything i would have been like yeah great that's  good get it a snake coming out of an apple i mean i don't know what i mean i'm just making something up  anything like a horrendous any horrendous tattoo that you could have thought of i was going to be  like yeah good sounds good but well the microphone is choking someone in the by the way this is what i 
[03:27:00]  love to do is stand up i'm gonna have a microphone choking someone in i wish i had more fans i really  do but what i'm gonna get on my arm is a microphone choking one of those people that's come to see me and  then it's not about you bitch that's what i'm i don't know why i don't have more twitter followers  but i'm gonna i don't know why my audience is it's it's it's not as full as it should be but i'm gonna  get a tattoo choking one of them do you understand how crazy it is it's not crazy the real fan the true 
[03:27:30]  comedy fans and true no and true comedy don't understand that no it's it's like you're just you're  putting too much weight on something ridiculous call wanna call oh i'm gonna call i'll call let  me call derosa ask him well ask him on the line first of all he would know if there's one person  on this planet what that would get a tattoo dumber than you it's him did you see what his tattoo is  what's hold on let's ask him what his tattoo is let's see okay because i guarantee he would think that 
[03:28:00]  let's let me call he's got a tattoo that's like something like george carlin's kicking me in the balls or  keep kicking me in the balls or something like that hold on i think it's a good idea if he's  got a horrifying tattoo and now he's gonna now he's gonna approve your horrifying tattoos so you  can both have horrifying tattoos he'll say yes to yours just so that people will stop making fun of  his tattoo you think so oh he's not gonna answer oh i want to oh no this is oh this is a real like a 
[03:28:30]  good podcast look you don't need to call people defend it yourself no i'm defending because i just  want one opinion but you're right like lately you've been obsessed with that tattoos there was a  a little while ago you were obsessed with getting a juicer you finally i was only obsessed one day  with a juicer but you were gonna go at midnight to go get one like you were like i gotta go get a 
[03:29:00]  juicer i gotta start my diet i'm gonna finish my i'm gonna do i'm gonna do you were gonna do just like  a full only drink juices kind of a fast and you bought two a thing of carrot juice and a thing of  fruit juice you had one drink of each and that was it they were disgusting and you let them rot in the  fridge uh hey can bonnie wants to tell you so can i put you on speakerphone on our podcast  do you got two minutes yes yes hold on hold on yes yes all right see tell them see if you put the 
[03:29:30]  microphone oh put it by the mic okay colin yes hi bonnie okay rich wants to get a tattoo of a someone  of a microphone strangling a person in the front row and then on the bottom it says it's not about  you bitch can we please have your thoughts on that there's no but that's the thing there's no irony 
[03:30:00]  he really just wants it's like he it's he thinks it's just a fancy way of having no heckling on his  arm no it's not irony rich has no irony in him he doesn't even understand it  just the fact that he thinks that's like a good tattoo i don't even know what i don't even know 
[03:30:30]  what to say honestly if you want to know what my answer is whether you should get that or not  yes that's what you want my answer yeah my answer is leave him i know i almost did i was like are you  kidding me because i don't think like yes thank you thank you 
[03:31:00]  i don't get it either i said it's like it's like putting the hours of the club on your arm or like  which really stinks no the no the mic of the microphone is like it's like a big microphone  with arms coming out of the microphone it's even worse okay with arms coming out of the microphone 
[03:31:30]  and you know how the girls don't shut the fuck up like a pretty girl and the microphone is kind of  like leaning over and just either choking her or doing it with the mic cord you know what i'm saying  good yeah it's horrible it's visually it's visually horrible too it's even worse  it's a pretty tattoo than an asshole would get it's a ugly tattoo and it's jackass to treat  the highest order colin he was like why you think it's hacky i was like that's what you're worried 
[03:32:00]  about hacky yes exactly nobody would ever do that  colin i'm gonna get one a tattoo of uh a dog owner not picking up his dog's poop and put it's your job  bitch 
[03:32:30]  oh my god thank you colin for seriously i couldn't get through to him  i'm gonna chew about my window right now i'm so depressed  by the way your show the other night was  he's a little question for this podcast you gotta get some kind of uh neurology people on there and 
[03:33:00]  find out how somebody can be so quick and funny and smart as he can be sometimes and then be so  amsonite it's almost like when he's given time to think his iq goes now which is there's a lot of  people yeah it's over top of the head he's very smart and funny and quick and if he gets him any  five seconds to think things through he gets stummer the more he thinks well i think it's like a  computer like you know some computers go like they're able to go really fast and then some computers  can have a lot of information right right right like he's just got that part where he can 
[03:33:30]  go fast but he can't hold any kind of information all right well  well listen we got to run so you all right so you like it i gotta go thanks man talk to you later  what's that  your show was so good it was unbelievable how was it was so it was so good 
[03:34:00]  unconstitutional it was so good it just it makes you it makes you realize uh how  insignificant most comics are and how they are not saying anything on stage like like we do  uh brother  yeah but thank you guys all right i gotta go anyway  all right bye  thank you see i told you he'd like it 
[03:34:30]  uh-huh no he said it was original didn't he say it was original stop you know you know you're  trying to be like this i'm the dumb guy who doesn't get it i'm not the dumb guy i'm  one of the smartest guys around i like the idea i think it's a cool tattoo i wish derosa would  have asked i guarantee only dumb people think they're the smartest dudes around because everybody  knows that there's a fucking really incredibly smart people yeah there is i mean there's some  smart people that understand game of thrones yeah okay i'm getting really pissed off with game of 
[03:35:00]  thrones can you finish one of the stories maybe let one of the kids find their mom maybe something  positive to end up out of it okay all right just one thing you know hey it's just every  what the fuck is that noise she's using a remote control car up in her room or no it's her pencil  sharpener oh uh you know just finish one story and mad men last night's episode of oh by the way 
[03:35:30]  last night rich said i said he said this happened in the past game of thrones i said you don't know  that we don't know when this is taking place it could be the future and he got really mad at me he's  like this is the past when there was dragons no i said no you did too you said that i didn't say  when there was dragons when people uh use dragons as a myth back then okay dragons were a myth but  that was way back in the day okay i knew there wasn't dragons who the fuck really like i thought 
[03:36:00]  there was dragons all right sure sounded that way last but dragons aren't from the future they're from  the past maybe i should get you don't know that they're not from the future what oh really the  future hasn't happened yet yeah okay but in the past there's so many writings there's so many uh  children's books books all kinds of things on dragons i like how you got stuck on the word books 
[03:36:30]  no nothing books i'm saying what are those things again they open they've got you think you're so smart  i'm a really brilliant person how was your how was your disco you worked the other night oh my god i  i just do these i i mean i don't know what will happen if i get in front of an audience that actually  gets me what could possibly i might just break down and cry i might just start crying because most of my  my sets lately have been like i don't know i mean it's i don't want to get mad at people you know but i i 
[03:37:00]  have a hard time giving them the thing that they want i don't know what they want to be honest well  but it's not uh it's not necessarily what i do well this place was an actual saturday night i did an  actual nightclub did the second you walked off stage the music cut on the minute i said good night  the music blasted i was like really you couldn't wait until i was off stage for one minute like before 
[03:37:30]  i mean it was like well they started okay so it was it was a dance club like where your drink glowed  in the dark that kind of place right so how does a drink glow in the dark what does that mean you  know it's like where it's like a black light or something do you know do you know uh another  a jewish scientist was the best ones are came up with a straw that you put in your drink i love that  idea and you can tell it glows if it's got if there's a date or any kind of drug in your drink 
[03:38:00]  some kind of nice and uh go ahead so the dance club people went to your show so they're ruining  it for all the fellows that just want to get their dick wet huh um what's that so they uh people at  your show that were trying to get into the dance club early you said so i don't know but i'm i'm  thinking that you know they cost 20 bucks to get in but i think that they just decided to pay the  20 bucks and get in early so they could get in because the minute that i was done i mean they 
[03:38:30]  cleared the dance floor they started the show late which i guess was part of the problem so they had  a huge lineup of people waiting to get in while i was on and they could have just given me the light  early they could have just gotten me off i wouldn't care if i got paid the same amount it wasn't  like it was the most fun show i'd ever been doing but most people were just talking in the back like  just waiting for the show to be done and then so they finally like right at 45 minutes gave me  the light i got off thank you good night boom so many men came on that and then and then it was 
[03:39:00]  like ridiculous i'm not even kidding how fast that place filled up like just and then when we went  outside there was a huge long line who goes to a dance club like who but also these people were  like in their 40s and stuff it's not like some of the people that i was talking to in the audience  they were not like the youngest well those were people that were going to the show they probably  left but i don't understand why i don't know whatever bob levy was the only other comedian i  was the second one bob levy headlined it the week before two weeks before whenever they had it last 
[03:39:30]  and then me and i'm gonna guess they're probably gonna do it again oh we didn't let's give a shout  out to a we didn't give our comments let's do a shout out to bob we'll give a shout out to bob  levy this week bob levy uh bob levy uh bob levy uh who can you believe we're on the same circuit  now and i who uh who's really a kind-hearted very nice person just because he eats i always thought 
[03:40:00]  it was whipped cream out of uh women's asses that's how he closes the show yeah uh but it's actually not  it's some kind of dressing like douchey's dressing salad dressing which to me is gross like the whipped  cream out of someone's ass okay i don't know i feel like that's that's fine i don't know if he's  still close salad dressing who it's too rich yeah i was working eat it plain me leaving maybe he takes  a carrot or something me leaving florentine we're working together in florida so we didn't know the 
[03:40:30]  lineup and i was going to either close or or host and uh whether levy oh the first night levy said  let me uh middle florentine was going to host the first night let him middle and i would close  because he said he wanted to make a uh uh tape for tv he wanted to do you know he wanted to film 
[03:41:00]  up yeah and so florentine goes up does i don't know 15 20 minutes very funny and then i then leave he  goes up to make his tv tape and i think the first bit was out of his mouth how many guys like to come  uh oh that was i think his first bit for his tv set how many guys like to come really no none of us  none of us and then he proceeded how many people eat breakfast then he proceeded uh to i mean he did 
[03:41:30]  very well but i don't know what kind of tv he was planning on doing unless you know and then i went on  and then i said guess what i'm hosting the rest of the week uh and then florentine and then levy closed  and and so we're going to give a shout out to bob levy he's our comic of the week right comic of the  week man comic of the week is bob levy originally from staten island living in jersey okay he does 
[03:42:00]  live in jersey south jersey he lives somewhere else i don't know i don't know what you think half the  time so bobby levy i guess uh my robert levy uh so uh i was in a in in  the midwest over the week and i walked and i wrote i wrote a bit out of this and bonnie helped me with  it but i truly i walked into a a sandwich in a gas station though and it was a good gas station not 
[03:42:30]  like they had a sandwich place in it and and and i was getting a half a sub uh you're the worst  storyteller i'm sorry turkey and swiss on whole wheat right already it's like what what's wrong  with it it is hard to listen to you it's not hard to listen i carry this a gas station a good uh it was  a good had a nice sandwich i'm thinking i'm gonna get a a a a a sandwich at the gas station uh 
[03:43:00]  a good gas station go ahead no forget it because you ruin every good story why don't you just say  i go in to get a sandwich i say the lady take out the bread no no because no no at any  whatever it wasn't known as a sandwich are you on drugs right now i mean seriously  whatever so i said to the girl can you please scoop out some of the bread 
[03:43:30]  and she looked at me like i asked her to explain einstein's theory on relativity  and she goes what do you mean take out the bread i go scoop out the bread she goes what we don't we  don't do that here it's against policy and i wrote a bit about but who the you know and she was overweight  i didn't want to say anything like the reason i want it scooped out you know because you can't attack  people but although you know i figured this out you know chris chris everybody talks about this 
[03:44:00]  lap band surgery uh-huh let me tell you about addiction folks addiction after you get through  the physical part when you stop or whatever you quit it's it's about the mental addiction well bill  mar said it's well it's a weird way to solve your addiction problems it's like well let me say what  i'm saying before i hear what bill mar said what i'm saying that's a quick fix lap band surgery you're  going to lose weight why wouldn't you just want the joke that i said that bill mar said because i'm  in the middle of doing mine if his was close to mine i don't want people to take away it would take 
[03:44:30]  away but what i'm saying it's a quick fix uh-huh because no one gets like when you're a drug addict  or an alcoholic there's no really pill to make you stop you know they might have come up with something  but that's not going to make you stop that's just gonna whatever and what's going to happen is he's  going to lose weight but he's going to be at a party and he's going to take a bite of an aclair or  something and back out to the races that's what's going to happen you know an aclair that's what that 
[03:45:00]  usually is what triggers you know the relapse you know that okay the relapse so i'm just saying it  it's a quick fix and i don't attack people that are overweight because it's an addiction and but  this girl had no clue what i was talking about when i said take the bread out what did bill mar say  where was your joke that i might have stepped on should i have told the bill mar joke i didn't tell  the joke i gave the premise well why wouldn't i don't understand i'm not doing my bits from stage 
[03:45:30]  on the podcast i do well then why wouldn't you let me tell the bill mar thing well i gave the setup  the premise out to the races oh we're just doing setups welcome to our show just setups  if you want to hear the punchlines you're going to have to come see a live show rich voss  getting a new tattoo just setups welcome to our podcast just setups 
[03:46:00]  oh my god are you crazy you're really out of your mind you spent an hour uh  i will not tell you the funny part i do do this on stage a sandwich  i mean you took an hour setting it up and if you want to hear the rest of the story  where are you playing this weekend i'm at the stand no friday night and we're at the count  basie theater count basie theater saturday night get your tickets bonnie mcfarland rich 
[03:46:30]  voss jim florence that's a that's a hell of a show that's a hell of a chris covert my boy chris  covert's gonna be on it chris covert throws me a lot of work that guy he's supposed to bring food  from his restaurant i know i always forget he has a deli which pays i think for his comedy  his deli must be doing makeup i don't think so why his eyes always look like he's got eyeliner on  or something oh maybe i did sort of think that the last time i saw him i had one split second of 
[03:47:00]  like let's see he got makeup on but it was dark so maybe he does what's bill mars uh joke bill mars  said the the the lap band is like a i can't remember the setup i do just punch lines this  was rich voss with just setups and bonnie mcfarland he said it's like uh fixing your cocaine addiction by  gluing your nostrils together yeah it's a quick fix it's funny it was a funny bit it's not 
[03:47:30]  you just like bill mars i love bill mars do you know what we're good friends you know i open for  them all the time someone said a funny thing on the radio and just not even a comic about oj simpson  they they used to call him the juice or something and he's so fat now they call him the gravy  or something that's what the guy said i don't know what it was i bet he heard a comic say that 
[03:48:00]  and oh he probably took it from a comic you're right the guy on radio took it from a comic yeah  let's give a shout out to whoever that comic is that got ripped off that got ripped off by the radio  guy they they never know that it's wrong yeah they take stuff i heard people like when when  the guy said that the other guy goes oh i'm using that i'm gonna take that oh i know people say  that yeah i'm using that well that's mine you can't use that intellectual property so we're doing  this thing on saturday this rebuild seaside this it's also for a great cause uh there's a lot of

[03:50:00]  would have done i did what a hero would you tell your hero story and i'll tell mine you have one  yeah yeah well will you tell yours first in case you step on mine okay i had a motorcycle  and um when i was i think it was i was home from college i was like 18 or 19 i guess maybe 19  and stop your stories are way more boring i just got started i didn't do anything relaxing i was riding 
[03:50:30]  my motorcycle okay this is in the northern wilds of canada so even though it was summertime  it was really cold out and how cold because you don't even know temperatures here you've been  how long have you been i still work in celsius i have to like really miss you i know 70 is like room  temperature like we go ahead okay and 100 is boiling i think oh no no that's in celsius see that's celsius

[03:51:30]  i i really was doing that um so let's hear your hero story so i was coming from a party which was in a  rural part of the town and on the highway coming back and a guy was walking along the side of the  road all bloodied he must have been in a fight he was dragging his jacket shirt was off and um i pulled 
[03:52:00]  over the guy was pretty drunk really bloodied and uh put a helmet on him and drove him home  rode him home and uh he tried to get me to go in with him but i wouldn't he didn't know who i was  or anything you know obviously why do you want you to go in because he wanted to fuck me maybe he  wanted you to clean he knew i was a lady a lady on a motorcycle giving him a ride home after he got  beaten the shit out of and then one night you know maybe a week later i walked into the local bar and 
[03:52:30]  this is how crazy and weird i was i had like one of those long jackets on you know those like  sort of yeah like a duster something something like kurt russell would wear yes yes and i have  my motorcycle helmet and i walked in and he was just at the bar with his friends and then he turned  around and he looked and then he looked at my helmet and then he like turned back to all his  friends like that must be her and then i walked out wow that's a good story it is kind of good in 
[03:53:00]  a way like i saved the man's life he didn't save his life he was walking home and then he's always  like wondering who was that girl but he was walking home so he was yeah but it was still  miles and miles from his house maybe in the middle of the night i mean probably like two  o'clock in the morning that's a pretty good story he could have frozen to death it was probably like  may i mean it was pretty cold still one time i ran into a burning uh church and rescued some kids
