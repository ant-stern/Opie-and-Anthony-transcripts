<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a contentious segment focused on Frenchie, a recurring caller known for his French accent and comedic bits.  His absence sparked a series of heated calls from listeners eager to verbally spar with him, using highly offensive and homophobic language.  Callers Henri and Richard, along with a trucker named Max, engaged in a chaotic shouting match with Frenchie, filled with personal attacks, homophobic slurs, and graphic sexual descriptions.  Martini Steve, a show staffer, was unexpectedly drawn into the conflict, becoming a target of Frenchie's offensive remarks about his clothing.  The hosts attempted to frame the segment as a debate, but it quickly dissolved into a vulgar free-for-all.  The segment concluded with the hosts seemingly "firing" Frenchie, citing a lack of material and his inability to adapt to the show's changed dynamic following a two-year hiatus.  The discussion then shifted to Frenchie's poorly attended birthday party, with humorous anecdotes about its lack of attendees (only five), poor ambiance (no music, bright lights, meager food), and the presence of a crying baby.  Martini Steve remained in the studio during this portion.

The show continued with further mockery of Frenchie's disastrous birthday party, focusing on the underwhelming gifts received and the absence of his brother due to a fight with his girlfriend.  Billy Mac called in to add to the criticism, claiming he'd had more fun at communion.  The conversation then transitioned to a prank call incident involving Billy, who had threatened to drive a truck through a restaurant.  This was followed by a call with actor James Remar, discussing his role in *Blade: Trinity*, his sex scenes with Kim Cattrall in *Sex and the City*, and other aspects of his career.

Next, Jeff Timmons of 98 Degrees joined the show. The conversation centered on comparisons between Timmons and Nick Lachey,  including their respective popularity and personal lives, focusing on Lachey's wife, Jessica Simpson, and Timmons' divorce. Brief calls with Tracy Morgan and Dominic Chianese (Uncle Junior from *The Sopranos*) followed, with comments on the show's humor and the struggles of WNEW, their former radio station, attributed to management decisions after their departure.  A drunken Christmas party incident involving WNEW's program director, Frankie Blue, was recounted, teasing a later playback of Frankie Blue's intoxicated on-air rant.

A significant portion of the show focused on a heavily intoxicated Frankie Blue's on-air performance at Mix 102.7.  Multiple clips were played, highlighting his numerous on-air mistakes, including mispronouncing the station's call letters and talking over the music. His slurred speech and nonsensical ramblings about a RuPaul-judged contest were central to this segment. The hosts speculated that Frankie Blue was fired following this broadcast.  Professional wrestler Triple H made a brief in-studio appearance, discussing his career, injuries, his role in *Blade: Trinity*, and his relationship with the McMahon family. He also shared anecdotes about his experiences with other wrestlers, Wesley Snipes, X-Pac, and X-Pac's ex-girlfriend China, and the release of her sex tape.  A former Mix 102.7 employee, Earl, called in, offering little information about Frankie Blue's firing, prompting speculation from the hosts.

Another segment featured a more extensive interview with Triple H, delving into the difficulties faced by wrestlers leaving WWE, the challenges of maintaining fame outside the WWE machine, and the impact of the internet and fan websites on wrestling storylines and wrestlers' public images.  He discussed his relationship with Goldberg, including a public altercation, and his loyalty to Vince McMahon.  The conversation also touched upon the negative impact of internet spoilers on wrestling events and the effect of online gossip on wrestlers' personal lives, particularly regarding his relationship with Stephanie McMahon.  This was followed by an in-studio appearance by three female contestants from *The Apprentice*.  The conversation covered *The Apprentice*, Donald Trump, reality TV editing, and the firing of one contestant for making an anti-Semitic remark.  They also pitched a new radio show idea to the hosts.  Gene Simmons then called in, joining the discussion about marriage, relationships, and differing perspectives on attractiveness between men and women.  Jim Norton's unusual sexual preferences provided recurring comedic elements throughout this conversation.

The show concluded with a segment featuring Gene Simmons, focusing on relationships, attraction, honesty, and the roles of money and power.  The conversation included frank discussions of sex, prostitution, and marriage.  Simmons debated the role of money in attracting women and discussed his views on marriage vows and accountability. He promoted his new DVD and upcoming tour.  The three female *Apprentice* contestants, Elizabeth, Yvonne, and Stacey, briefly promoted their websites, and the overall tone remained irreverent and sexually charged.

We got a bunch of French guys that want to take him on.  He's not up yet.  You want to take on Frenchy, dear?  I want to take on Frenchy, that piece of shit that's faggot, faggot, faggot. 
[00:04:30]  That's what the fucking guy says is, faggot.  This is probably the worst fake French accent I've ever heard.  You know what? You can't even keep it going for more than a word.  And then you just start talking like the American that you are.  Did we get you, bro?  Uh, no.  Oh, no. Now he's Mexican.  He's Canadian. What are you, sir?  Hey, man, I'm French. 
[00:05:00]  Sorry to fucking bother you guys today, then.  I am very French. Very true.  You, Opie and Anthony, and fat kids. Have a good day.  Wait, sir, sir, sir. I apologize for questioning you.  Sir?  Oh.  Say something. Say something.  Mamon, Jacques, speak French.  Uh, no, no. I don't speak French. I am from. My family is from.  What a tool.  I do not speak French.  I do not speak French. I have an accent. 
[00:05:30]  I just do the accent poorly.  Okay. Sorry to bother you.  Uh, shut up, stupid. Just, just.  That was awful.  Awful.  You mean, uh, I am French.  See?  Well, we do have one guy that's going to take on Frenchies.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm looking for the new Frenchie.  Painted a little thin mustache on himself in the mirror.  Little mustache that curled up at the sides.  Wearing a beret, bicycling around town with a baguette sticking out of the basket.  Dragging his hairy legs, non-shaven under the armpit, twat of a woman around town. 
[00:06:00]  Smoking a cigarette, tightly clutched.  Yeah.  Between the index finger.  Yeah.  And thumb.  Judgmental, emasculating woman fingers.  Just going, uh, uh, let me, you stupid American.  Yeah, ooh.  We could do everything if it wasn't for America.  Ooh.  You frog.  Let's hear it.  You fake frog.  They've given us nothing.  Hey, thanks for, what, they fixed milk so we could drink it? 
[00:06:30]  Big deal.  Thanks for giving us a nice mouthful of cow load.  They must have given us something besides milk.  We've pasteurized your milk, you stupid American.  Exactly.  Uh-huh, we took your regular toast and made it sweet with egg and cinnamon.  You just would put it in a toaster.  We made it great with cinnamon and egg and milk.  Fucking fuck.  Uh-huh.  Wow, this guy's pissed.  You used to just kiss and go, mm-mm. 
[00:07:00]  We taught you to put the tongue in the mouth.  Jim Norton took it to the extreme and puts it in the asshole.  But that is doing it, what they say, how you say,  French.  Who's pissed off?  Uh, this guy listening in.  Henry.  Henry.  Henry.  Henry.  I called you guys yesterday.  Oh, you're the Jacques Cousteau sounding guy.  That is me, yeah.  Who's still in the men of the Calypso.  I told because I'm going to take on Frenchie.  This guy definitely wants to take on Frenchie. 
[00:07:30]  Where is Frenchie today?  Is he hiding under his, uh, sheets?  He's not up yet.  Not until nine o'clock.  Who answered the phone?  He said he turned his phone off or something.  Yeah, no, he goes right to his voicemail.  Oh, I think we're going to go, uh, we're going to have dueling Frenchies, uh, in the  nine o'clock hour today, Ben?  When are you going to put the siding on that god-awful Eiffel Tower?  It's been a wreck for years.  When are you going to put some walls on that thing?  You're welcome for the Statue of Liberty.  Oh, oh, oh.  That is true.  Ah, we didn't even ask for it.  Shut up.  All right.  Send it over like a gift. 
[00:08:00]  Like, uh, Norton is the only one who puts tongues and asses, that fat bastard, anyway.  I do.  Yeah, thanks for that Statue of Liberty, taking it upon yourself to let us accept the dregs  of society.  Yeah.  Give us your, your disgusting, your broke, your AIDS-infested.  That's not how it goes.  You're going to say it on there?  It should have, you're tired and you're...  You're worthless and weak.  Exactly.  And you're...  Thanks, France.  What a present that is.  Here, take this, put it at the entrance to your main harbor, and it's a sign that says 
[00:08:30]  everyone with huge problems, come over here now.  How about refixing that stupid statue so the thing says, give us your big tinted with no  gag reflex.  How about that?  That'd be lovely.  Oh, thank you for that, fat bastard, Jerry Lewis.  Hey, you guys decided you liked him.  Piece of shit he is.  We didn't give him to you.  You guys accepted him.  You can't get enough of that nutty professor.  Oh, Jerry.  That is so funny.  Look at when he goes... 
[00:09:00]  I don't like him, so...  All right.  Whatever.  Get that Frenchie on the phone.  Yeah, thanks for Gerard Depardot, you dopey French.  Faggot.  What an awful actor he is.  You and the other two faggots.  Gerard Depardot.  Oh, thank you for Maurice Chevalier.  Thank heaven.  The little girls.  All right.  He was pretty good.  All right, bro.  We're going to call you in a little while.  We got Henry's number or whatever.  Henri.  Henri.  Henri.  Henri. 
[00:09:30]  It's Henri.  I want you to say Henri.  Hey, Henri.  I worry about you, Henri.  You might fall under questioning.  You might fall under questioning.  They were going to find it, Henri.  Hooray.  Karen, that is all we have.  Call me back when you have that cocksucker on me, okay?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh.  Wow.  That's going to be the...  Henri.  That's going to be the bit of the day right there when those two guys go at it. 
[00:10:00]  Oh.  V and Anthony.  XM 202.  All right.  We got Frenchie on the line, and we got another Frenchman that wants to take out Frenchie.  So, we need rules here, because it really sucks when they start screaming at each other.  Yeah.  Can't hear anything.  Should we do it in debate fashion, and then maybe at the end have them go at it?  Yeah.  Frenchie debates?  One coward at a time.  One coward at a time.  Okay.  One coward at a time.  And then the grand finale, we'll let them go at it.  Let them go at it together.  Because the whole going at it thing is good, but it's hard to, you know... 
[00:10:30]  Should we have an opening statement so they could both assess one another?  Sure.  Why don't we do that?  All right.  We got to go to the challenger.  His name's really Ernie, but he's French, so he wants to pronounce...  Henri.  Henri.  Henri, or something like that.  His name is all scrambled here.  Henri.  Henri.  I want my money, Henri.  All right.  Henri.  Henri.  Henri.  Henri.  Henri.  Henri.  Henri.  Are you ready for your opening statement to Frenchie as you try to take him out? 
[00:11:00]  Yes.  Now, are you familiar with Frenchie?  I am.  I'm familiar with that.  Okay.  You've heard him?  Unfortunately, yes.  Okay.  And what do you think about him?  Go ahead.  He has no material anymore.  Every call is fagadis, fagadad, moron dis.  He's got no material.  He never...  You know, when you can reach him, he has nothing to say.  And he's just a little French fagad.  That's it.  All right.  That's your opening statement?  Need I say more?  All right. 
[00:11:30]  Very good.  Okay.  He kind of bashed Frenchie when he's down.  All right.  Frenchie has done a lot for the show, but his last couple appearances, very lacking.  Yeah.  Very lackluster.  We'll see if he can come back now and assess what Henri has said.  Frenchie?  Yes.  The real Frenchie.  Did you invite me to dinner with you and your girlfriend last night?  Yes, I did.  Why?  Because we're going to Pomodoro.  Right.  But why would you invite me?  Because you go eat over there every once in a while. 
[00:12:00]  You want to kiss my ass because you know your appearances on the show have been lackluster and  you're trying to get in a little bit.  Not at all.  I will not back from that.  Why would you invite another guy out if you're hanging with your chick?  Well, because we're going to this place, man.  It's a good place.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  Suck it.  He's like Pepe Le Pew.  I was going to do that old gag. 
[00:12:30]  Put the spaghetti in my crotch.  Just like the Germans did.  All right.  So, Frenchie, someone is trying to take you out.  It's Henri on the other line and he had his opening statement.  Were you able to hear it?  Yes, I was able to.  All right.  And what do you have to say about that, Frenchie?  Well, you know what?  Who is he?  Who does he think he is?  He's not French, first of all.  Why?  You don't think he's French?  No, I don't think so. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, okay.  And why don't you think?  Why not?  Because he doesn't sound French at all.  He's just trying to put a little accent of what he was saying.  Oh, he's calling him a fraud.  Oh.  A French fraud.  All right.  French fraud, yeah.  The yellow light has come on.  So, give the rest of your opening statement.  And, okay, yeah, it's true.  I need to change my material.  But that's going to come up.  That's not really a problem.  Frenchie, you're supposed to kind of attack him now.  Yeah, not defend yourself like you're a fucking author explaining your last novel, stupid.  But he's a nobody, and you can go and suck it, that fucking dick. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, boy.  All right.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Now I'm goddamn pissed off now.  Oh, yeah.  You sound really pissed off.  You really do sound wild up.  I have enough.  Watch out for the old one, too.  It's coming.  I'm so angry I could give my country over to a bunch of Nazis.  I'm so mad I could put a daisy in your hair and polish your shoe.  I don't know what that means.  All right.  There goes Frenchie.  Another guy, Richard, wants in really fast from Texas.  Richard, yes? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  All right.  What's going on?  Well, personally, I think these two assholes who think they're French should speak a little  French, like with a taken guy in the Marge and Marbe.  So what do you think about that?  Are you French?  Yes, I am.  I'm from Montreal, Quebec.  Oh, French-Canadian.  Yeah.  Well, a French cowboy, though.  He's in Texas.  Well, I'm a trucker, so.  Oh, a French trucker.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:14:30]  He's trucking croissants around the country.  All right.  Let's go back to Henri.  Another load of French bread coming in.  Here he comes.  All right, Henri, that was the warm-up.  We've got to hear your A material.  You've got to get mad.  This is it right here.  Let's go at the Frenchie.  That was a waste.  He comes on the phone telling me that I'm not French, and he calls me a nobody.  He comes on the air to invite you to dinner, and I guarantee his girlfriend would not even  be there.  It would be in an alley to try to suck your dick, O.P., because he's trying to kiss your 
[00:15:00]  ass.  That's very obvious.  Okay?  Yeah.  So, I don't understand how he can come onto the air and say that about me.  And meanwhile, I can guarantee that his grandfather died with Hitler's dick in his mouth.  I can guarantee you that.  Wow.  All right.  Funny and sexy.  He's got me.  And I knew that Norton would like that.  I did, buddy.  How are we going to get the winner?  First one surrenders?  Wow.  His grandfather died with Hitler's dick in his mouth. 
[00:15:30]  All right.  All right.  Let's see if Frenchie has a response.  That's going to hurt.  Before we put them both on the line for the grand finale.  I like it.  Violent.  A little creative.  Some history in there.  And you can picture that mustache and the hand on the French head.  Frenchie, what do you have to say about that?  His Hitler pube swept over to one side.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  His new book, Mind Coward.  All right.  Sorry, Frenchie.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  No, I messed up.  I should have been paying attention.  All right.  Go ahead, Frenchie.  Okay.  Well, Henry, first of all, his father died with his dick inside the queen's pussy because 
[00:16:00]  you know what?  What?  He's a fucking fraud.  He's not French.  I'm telling you.  He's a fucking asshole.  But it's radio.  Who cares if they're really French?  As long as we can have the illusion.  I like the people that try to make believe that they're French when they're not.  That's fucking fad.  I think he is French.  I do, too.  I don't think so.  But make him speak some words of French.  I want to hear a whole fucking sentence.  Frenchie, you're kind of biting off of his, your grandfather, you know, is blowing Hitler. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  What do you have to say about that?  And if he died in the queen's pussy, that's not a bad place to go.  No, that's not bad.  Especially, you know, back then, the queen was still kind of...  Better than blowing Adolf while he eats poison chocolate.  Yeah, you're, you know.  Frenchie, come on.  Let's go.  This is it.  Do or die.  Well, uh, I'm not going to surrender yet, but I still call him a father and he's his asswipe.  That's what he is.  All right.  Let him speak French.  I want to hear it.  You don't know much French, you fad. 
[00:17:00]  You tell me like you know me.  You don't know me.  You sound Italian, you fucking greaseball.  You fucking pussy ass.  Shut up.  Listen to this, fad.  Yeah, listen to this.  At least put a better accent at it, you moron.  There is no accent.  This is the one I was born with.  Yeah, but you sound really fucked up with it, man.  Talk like you know me.  They probably peddled you when you were in school, speaking like a little faggot that you are.  This is all you have.  Huh?  This is all you have. 
[00:17:30]  Go back into your hole and die.  And this is all you have.  Yes, I have more than you do, you prick.  How does Opie's balls taste?  Tell me that.  They taste like your fucking ass, you fag.  Yeah, they taste like Anthony's balls.  Your breath smells like a dick.  Yeah, but you look like a fucking dick.  Tell me you have a girlfriend, please.  What is his name, huh?  It's your sister, you fuck.  Please, my sister.  Please.  It's your sister that I was spending on your ass all night, telling her who's your daddy, you whore. 
[00:18:00]  Guys, this is...  How's that, huh?  We know who won this one.  So, please.  Yeah, sure.  It's quite obvious.  No, but just tell me one sentence.  You have no material, come on there and call me faggot, please.  Come on, come on, you faggot, please.  Faggot, please.  You faggot, please.  You, you see, give me a word in French.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Closing statements, we'll go with Henri first.  Henri?  I think everything I said speaks for itself, no?  I mean, this guy has no material.  I come on the air and put him down every which way. 
[00:18:30]  He has nothing to say.  Every other word is faggot, moron.  It's the same shit.  Two years to come up with new material, and he has nothing.  So, I mean, please.  This is no contest.  All right.  And Frenchy, to you.  Well, that's not a contest, first of all.  And you are fraud, so you have nothing to say.  You couldn't fall back into your whore.  Shut up when I'm talking, you faggot.  Freak.  You fuck.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Yeah, you see, I got you, huh, you little whore. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, Frenchy, make a little comeback.  I'm trying to do this faggot time to speak, and he doesn't accept.  Okay.  Well, I'm going to make you my little bitch sooner or later.  Don't worry about it.  I don't even know who's winning this one.  Go ahead.  All right.  Yeah, but I won already.  It doesn't really matter, you goddamn cocksucker.  There's nothing else to say except stupid words.  Please, continue.  But I like that.  Don't you think so?  Well, I want to still hear a little word of French from you, you little fud.  I'm on the air, please.  You on the air, what?  You sound like the fucking guy from Salak 13. 
[00:19:30]  You sound like that French faggot on the Salak 13.  When you kiss your girlfriend, you'll taste my dick.  No, my girlfriend actually blows me.  That's good enough.  Don't you worry.  I don't need your help.  You and the guys in the city while you suck Obie's balls.  That's a good one.  You son of a bitch.  One good line was when the guy, when Henri said, what does Obie's balls taste like in French,  he said, your ass, you faggot.  That was a good line.  That was a good one.  All right. 
[00:20:00]  Well, I do want to hear Henri speak French, though.  I don't know if I'm going to.  Yes, I really kind of do.  I don't know.  I don't know much French.  Growing up in France, I went to a school that spoke mainly American, so I don't know much  French at all.  My ass.  Okay, well, how about a little something in French?  What?  No, no, I'm asking Henri.  I barely know any French at all.  Henri, I cannot believe you grow up in France enough where you have an accent and you don't  speak any French.  I speak barely any French.  How about a little bit?  Go ahead.  Say something, you faggot. 
[00:20:30]  Come on, let's go.  Something.  There's nothing else to say.  Okay, how about this one?  It's best don't kill it.  I'm going to kill you.  All right, Henri's on hold.  I've got to go to Fritz in Dallas.  We only have like a minute left in the show.  We didn't play What Did We Learn Today?  That's okay.  Let's say hi to Fritz in Dallas.  Go ahead, Fritz.  What do you got?  How are you guys doing today?  Good.  I can't believe these French guys.  They really piss me off.  I am so glad that my country invaded them in 1941.  You know why they planted all the trees along the road there in France, don't you? 
[00:21:00]  Why?  Soldiers could march in the shade.  And you know why they closed the year of Disney in France, don't you?  No.  Because every time they had fireworks, all the people in the park jumped on the fucking ground.  You moron.  Those are these guys.  I can't believe it.  You know, where I was living is like 20 miles from the border of France.  And we used to go in and beat up French guys just for the hell of it sometimes, you know? 
[00:21:30]  You know what?  Hey, listen, buddy.  You know what the French...  It was so easy to do, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, listen to what I have to say.  You know what the French...  You know they knew what they were doing when they sold Louisiana to America, you fucking cocksucker.  What do you know?  You know, in Germany...  A Louisiana purchase joke?  You got some...  Wow.  You got some good music that comes from Germany.  What rock bands do you have come from France?  And no need for inbreeding rednecks, you cocksucker. 
[00:22:00]  I think we're done.  ...stucked back in the 1960s with a fucking...  No need for inbreeding...  All right.  And there they go.  We'll make a decision tomorrow.  No, Frenchie won.  Frenchie came back again there.  Yeah, Frenchie's title is still safe for now.  We'll do this tomorrow.  I think we're out of here.  I think we're done.  I think we're off the air.  All right.  I hate that they can do that to us.  What was the last word that was said tonight?  Today.  What?  That ought to hold the little fuckers.  The worst, worst, worst, worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:22:30]  Ugh.  I wouldn't order this shit either.  You suck.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they're not awful.  Okay, terrific.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  No more of that.  It's bad for you.  Frenchie's on the line.  Anthony has a problem with one of the members of the Opie and Anthony program.  This is the old Frenchie, Anthony.  Hey.  Hey, Frenchie.  What's going on?  Hello, guys.  How are you?  I have a little problem with Martini Steve. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, he's got a problem with Martini Steve.  Where is that?  Oh, here it is.  Oh, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  Martini Steve is...  Oh, I need a little volume.  Oh, sorry about that.  There he comes.  Martini Steve.  All right, Martini Steve's in the studio.  Steve, because I know how you could get.  At least let Frenchie talk for a few seconds.  I want to see why he has a problem with you before you absolutely lose your mind.  Yeah, I can't figure out why he would have a problem with Steve.  Why?  I don't think there's much interaction there, but let's hear. 
[00:23:30]  Frenchie, what's your problem with our own Martini Steve?  Where does he get his clothes?  His what?  His clothes?  What he wears.  Closes?  His clothes?  Yes.  His clothes.  Oh, my clothes.  What the...  Yes, you look like a fucking fag, man.  Why have you chosen to kill yourself this morning?  Because you will not be living five minutes past these comments, leave your mouth.  But listen, where did you get this fashion you would like to hang out in? 
[00:24:00]  Is he in the building?  Because if I find out, dude, I'm not in the mood to be fucked with this morning, really.  Really?  Why?  Well, let's hear what Frenchie has to say, Steve.  No, let's not.  Let's find him and kick his teeth down his throat.  Frenchie, what's wrong with Steve's clothes?  Yeah.  I think that I know why he gets his horrible clothes, because he likes to hang out in truck  stops.  Yeah.  I fully admit that I bought the shirt I'm wearing in a truck stop, you fucking retard.  You like it, huh?  When a bunch of big black people get there and get you in the ass? 
[00:24:30]  Dude.  And get you flapped, you fat ass?  You're like flailing.  Oh, you suck.  You know what, dude?  Not the right morning.  They make the thing you are in the bathroom, you bitch.  What?  Wait, what did he say?  They make you drink the water from the bathroom, you know, while you get ass raped by a bunch  of goons.  What's his problem?  First of all, there's not a lot of black people in the truck stops, and not a lot of goons.  No? 
[00:25:00]  No.  Well, how about those bunch of rednecks from, you know, Texas, or from down Louisiana, you  know, when they speak out of a French, they say, who's your daddy, huh?  Huh?  Who's your daddy, you big bitch?  What?  Why do you have a problem with Martin Easton?  I can only assume that he has been diagnosed with some crippling, debilitating illness,  and he's looking to euthanize himself as quickly as humanly possible, because this son of a  bitch is looking to get the shit kicked out of him.  That's not going to happen. 
[00:25:30]  Dude, have you, have, I've stood in the room next to you, you are as nice as can possibly  be.  On the other end of the phone, you grow a big, hairy sack?  Yeah, because Frenchy is the biggest wimp in person.  Yeah.  The biggest wimp.  But I'm a nice person.  All right, yeah, you're very nice to me, and you've invited me to your restaurant a number  of times.  Having said what you have just said this morning, if I see you again, I'm knocking your teeth  out.  Yeah, Frenchy, you're not going to be able to ever come by and say hi to you.  I know, he'll kill you.  You understand that, right?  Because Steve isn't messing around.  I was just doing what I was supposed to do. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, but there's no reason to call here and bother Steve about his Harvey Fierstein wardrobe.  Thank you.  There was a good reason behind it.  Horrible clothes.  Frenchy, who called you this morning and told you to fuck with me?  Your little girlfriend next to you, Ben.  Yeah, of course.  Wait, Ben's involved with us?  Of course.  Well, Frenchy has never had a problem with me in the past.  I can only assume King Instigator had something to do with this.  Who is your daddy?  Who is your daddy? 
[00:26:30]  He's afraid.  He really thinks he's going to get his ass kicked.  Stop it!  Are you kidding me, my friend?  Stop whining.  All right, hold on.  Okay, I'm surrendering.  I'm surrendering.  All right, hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right, Max the trucker is on the line.  He has a problem with Frenchy.  Go ahead.  Yeah, this is Max the pissed off truck driver.  I want to fucking zip tie this asshole to the grill on my freightliner, drive down the road, and use him as my personal bug shield.  Why don't you come by me, and I'll make you my little bitch, you fuck, sucker. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, come by with you big truck.  My sister-in-law's got a couple of poodles.  I put you under the hood, and I peace on you, you fuck.  You fucking ears, you queer.  You stupid bitch.  Yeah, I love it.  I love it.  You know, ONA, I love seeing these old World War II movies.  Go back into your old, you cross-brander.  Fucking blowing up everything.  Where are you driving right now?  In fucking Texas.  Why don't you drive off the road?  I'm right now. 
[00:27:30]  Why don't you next time you see a deal, I want you to hear this, you fuck.  You stupid bitch weirdos, man.  Not to make half your country.  He's trying too hard.  Max or Frenchy?  Yeah.  Yeah, Frenchy.  What?  I don't know, man.  I don't know what's happening with you.  You seem to be trying a little too hard.  No, no, I'm not trying that hard at all.  And now Ben is setting up bits for you.  What's going on?  It doesn't seem to be natural.  He called me all upset that he was off the show. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So what, you decided to?  No, I just said to attack Steve.  That would be funny.  I didn't think Steve would threaten to kill him.  No, Steve will now kill him.  You sink my teeth into my throat?  That's nice.  Thank you.  All right.  Henri.  The way of Frenchy is here, yes.  This stupid asshole.  Why are you talking to this jerk-off anymore?  Huh?  Listen, you fucking Italian asshole.  Come on the phone.  I want to come back on the show. 
[00:28:30]  I was beaten.  Shut the fuck up.  Like a long time ago.  Please just talk over me.  I wave the white flag.  What kind of French accent do you have?  You fucking touchebag.  You are done.  No, you're done.  No, you are not allowed to call the show anymore, you little faggot.  You have a white flag stuck in your ass, you faggot.  God damn it.  Shut the head up, man.  There's a white flag sticking out of your ass.  Yeah, well, you're going to have a black flag sticking up, you fucking ass, you fuck. 
[00:29:00]  You come back at the Marian comebacks where it just repeats what you said.  That's awful.  There's nothing to say.  See?  Shut the fuck up, man.  There's nothing to say.  You bust on Steve.  Steve's going to throat fuck you, then kill you.  No, you're going to come over your house, and it's going to make you use flames on his dick.  He's going to put flames on his dick.  You know what?  The girl's going to smack you mother's ass, you stickbag.  I've proven my point.  I have to go fuck Frenchie's girlfriend.  Goodbye, guys.  Wow.  You can come by anytime, and guess what? 
[00:29:30]  You wouldn't even last five fucking minutes.  That's why we like the new Frenchie.  He knows when to get out.  He comes in, he punches out.  He had a couple good ones, and he was gone.  What a fucking asshole.  This guy is fucking Italian on top of it.  We might have to have the two Frenchies go at it.  Wow.  He's a dick, man.  He's not even French.  I fucking hate that dick.  Well, all right, Frenchie.  I don't know.  All right, I surrender.  That is it.  Well, no, even the surrendering, I think, you know, I hate to do this. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, he hung up on himself.  Oh, no.  I think, uh, Frenchie, it's...  Yeah, he hung up, didn't he?  It's okay.  You can still tell him.  He's listening.  Yeah, Frenchie, um, I just don't think it's working out anymore.  I think, you know, you had your day in the sun over two years ago.  It's like you're breaking up with a chick.  It was, uh, it was big.  It was, uh, it was good.  The people seemed to enjoy it.  Yeah.  They really did seem to like the Frenchie character on the Opie and Anthony program, uh, before 
[00:30:30]  we got the boot.  But something about now when we're back, the new environment, the two years off, kind of  a different, a little, different feel to the show a little bit.  And I don't think, I don't think the Frenchie character of old is really fitting in.  Not to mention you have no new material whatsoever to the limited supply you had in the first  place.  So it might just be time, Frenchie, to turn around.  And say, au revoir. 
[00:31:00]  Au revoir.  Au revoir.  Au revoir.  And walk away.  Just walk away.  Just walk away.  Just walk away.  Au revoir, Frenchie.  Into the setting sun.  Ha ha ha, Frenchie.  Ha ha ha.  Au revoir, Frenchie.  There he goes.  And there he's.  Walking off.  Walking away with his head down.  Head down.  Beret tilted forward on his head.  Big French bread in a paper bag in his arm. 
[00:31:30]  There he goes.  Wearing his striped shirt.  Little kidnapped child on the back of the bike.  A Nazi invading his house.  That was a good call, though.  It had all the humor of the battle of the sexes.  The Ori and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  We have to talk about Frenchie's party, you were saying?  A little bit about Frenchie's party.  I feel bad.  I feel bad.  What do you feel bad about?  I missed it. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  You guys are dicks.  I missed it.  I came home Friday after our big meeting and fell asleep.  I woke up at like 8 o'clock at night or whatever it was.  And it threw me off for the entire weekend.  You have a little bit more of an excuse now.  You live out in the burbs now.  I knew you weren't coming.  Great Neck.  It's very hard to drive to this city.  I can't drive there from Great Neck.  Are they really all old in your neighborhood?  I have a bunch.  I live around old Jewish people. 
[00:32:30]  That's hilarious.  Oy vey.  I heard when you get out of the car, some lady started yelling, Zell, the white angel.  It is him.  This man needs a doctor.  After he cuts his throat.  Gets him some help.  That is great.  Yeah, I live in the neighborhood of old Jewish people.  So you weren't coming back for a Frenchie's party.  No, I screwed my sleep schedule up for the weekend. 
[00:33:00]  So by Saturday night, I had no clue what day it was.  And I could not get in my truck and drive back into the city.  Now you guys, you live here.  The hustle and bustle and herky and jerky of Manhattan.  Yeah, I live here.  His party was like a block away from where I live.  Yeah, and I didn't show up.  And Ovi didn't show up.  How many people were there?  Well, that's what I was going to say.  I went out Friday, hung out a little bit.  And then Ben calls me around, what, 11, 1130? 
[00:33:30]  Well, no, we were talking throughout the day after I had to give you restaurant advice,  which you didn't even use.  And then you, and then, oh, I'll see you at Frenchie's.  So I'm like, great.  So I have the pleasure of getting Billy Mac to pick me up, which is an adventure in itself,  riding with Billy from downtown Uptown.  With a Budweiser in one hand.  Talking about.  Allegedly.  Talking about the first time he met Frenchie, which we all forget when he threatened to  drive a truck through Frenchie's old restaurant, which I forgot about. 
[00:34:00]  And now they're pals.  Now they're best friends.  Oh, they're pals now.  Billy Mac.  You'd never know it from listening to the Voltham talk to each other.  So I had every intention of going to Frenchie's party.  I was pretty much making it an early Friday night, Anthony.  But I figured.  It was Saturday.  Oh, Saturday.  I'm sorry.  Well, he was, yeah, it was mentioned Friday.  So I was planning on making it an early night.  And the party's right there.  It's a couple blocks away.  I'm like, yeah, might as well stop in at the end of the night and say hi to everybody.  And Ben is text messaging me like crazy.  When are you going to get here?  And that's the first sign that I knew that he was just in party hell. 
[00:34:30]  Uh-oh.  Because Ben is like, you know, you guys, I mean, Ben is like just a social butterfly, man.  He knows where all the happening parties are every weekend, all the happening night spots.  He goes to the Saturday Night Live after parties.  Right.  He ends up at these, like, parties that end up in page six and, you know, entertainment magazines.  There's pictures and stuff.  Ben goes to these parties.  Hence, uh...  He knows how to do it.  I don't know how he does it.  I can't do it.  Hence all the rumors that he stars.  Maybe they're not rumors. 
[00:35:00]  It might be like the National Enquirer.  You know, Ben might be on to something with all these, uh, exaggerated things he comes in.  We were talking earlier...  Dan Aykroyd is hanging out with...  He was.  College girls.  He was.  That's true.  He's usually right, though.  Earlier about, uh...  And I'll give my review later on Blade Trinity.  But we were talking about that earlier.  And, uh, Ben goes, oh, Wesley Snipes.  Yeah, I was hanging out at a party with him one time.  I was sitting at the table and talking.  Nice guy.  Like, he just goes to these parties and knows everything, everybody. 
[00:35:30]  Wesley Snipes.  Yeah, Wesley Snipes.  That was years ago at Moomba.  7th Avenue.  See?  Yeah.  See, he knows.  He knows.  So...  He knows everybody.  Yeah.  So then he's at Frenchie's party.  I show up to Frenchie's with Billy and we walk in and I walk in and I see Kev sitting  on a chair.  Some French guy who's talking about serious stock.  Oh!  Frenchie and his girlfriend.  And I'm like, oh, and the lights are on bright and there's no music on.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  And Ben knows how to do it.  All the happening parties. 
[00:36:00]  The lights got to be dim, Ben.  Look, well, you're talking to Ben who throws his own birthday party every year.  Ben knows how to throw a party.  Yeah.  He picks the hottest clubs.  He picks the...  He gets a DJ.  What was that party that Ben organized in that place that used to be like a Yankee Cranky  shop?  Happy ending.  Happy ending.  Happy ending.  Oh, yeah.  Ben went there.  What a party that was.  Only Ben could find an old massage parlor to throw his birthday party.  Liquid Todd spinning.  Todd spun, yeah.  I mean, it was a pisser.  You're sitting in this area that used to be like, I don't know, the steam room. 
[00:36:30]  Yep.  Or the individual Yankee Cranky room.  Yeah.  Andrew W.K.  Showed up.  Now it's a club.  It looks like one big, huge, like, tiled bathroom, but now it's a club.  And Ben finds this place for his birthday party.  Andrew W.K. was there.  The guy from the spin doctors.  Voss was harassing every woman.  He wasn't Voss a real scumbag that night with somebody.  Yeah.  He was hitting on every woman.  He was like, hey, can you give me a Yankee Cranky?  You know, he was the one that's causing all the problems.  Yeah.  It was pretty funny.  It was a great party.  It had a great look.  Yeah.  It was one of those nice, cool Manhattan parties. 
[00:37:00]  Made the newspaper.  Yeah.  Made page six.  Yeah.  And that's what it's all about.  When Ben throws a party, he just knows how to throw a party.  And everyone wants to go to Ben's party.  Knows how it's done.  Ben's birthday parties is like velvet ropes, and there's a doorman, and there's a line.  It's like, but I know Ben.  Yeah.  I don't give a fuck.  You're not dressed right.  You're not herky and jerky enough.  It's a B-Y-O-B-D.  It's a bring your own big duties.  So, anyway, so I walked in, and I was like, oh, no. 
[00:37:30]  And I'm like, at first, I was like, oh, there's no music on.  There's like some cheese laid out and stuff.  And Billy's just hammered.  And then this guy starts talking to me about Sirius, and I just, I, at this point.  Well, everyone relax with Sirius stock.  Everyone owns Sirius stock.  Okay.  That's why that thing is never going to go way up like XM did.  Don't make it sound like, you know, I love when people start talking stocks, and they  go, well, I picked up Sirius.  Yeah, it might as well be a widget stock.  It doesn't matter what the company does, what it sells, what, what, you're just buying 
[00:38:00]  it, speculating, hoping it goes up, not based on anything.  Well, no, what is widget stock?  Is that white stock that acts like, uh, midget stock?  I see where you were going with that.  You were trying to make a white midget joke.  Good attempt.  Widget.  Yo, home.  How you doing, B?  Oh, I didn't think of midget.  I didn't even think of midget.  It's a wigger midget.  I did not even think of midget.  You know, most people buy Sirius because it's down low and they see XM, like, well, 
[00:38:30]  obviously, they're going to go right up to where XM is.  Based on nothing.  No financials.  It trades on emotion.  Yeah.  So, and believe me, everyone's got it.  That's why there's billions and billions of shares out there.  Don't worry about it.  Don't sound like Mr. Wall Street when you come up to us and go, hey, I own Sirius stock.  Ooh, great.  You're going to go to the shareholders meetings there, Skippy?  Ben doesn't miss a beat either.  It's like, are you on Sirius stock? 
[00:39:00]  They suck.  Yeah, they didn't pay me for months.  That's what I told him.  He's like, oh, how could they not pay you?  I go, trust me.  I know five other people the same thing happened to.  I've been looking at the financials.  Shut up.  You probably gave the guy 45 minutes of inside dirt.  He was having homosexual encounters in the Sirius, you know, whatever type of, I won't  even say the position, whatever type of empty studio who might be in there filleting new  talent.  Oh, my God.  Why are you holding a grudge?  I'm not holding a grudge at all.  That's a lousy $50,000.  Dude, I'm not holding a grudge at all. 
[00:39:30]  Hey, thanks for the job.  If you ever want to raise, let me know.  Yeah.  Wow.  Such anger.  Lazy fruit.  Such anger.  Wow.  Why is he a lazy fruit?  Because he didn't put the paperwork in?  Yep.  Yeah, I mean, we've been hinting about it, but at the old place, Jim lost out on $50,000  because someone didn't get the paperwork in.  I don't know.  To be honest with you, I don't know if it was $50,000, what the exact amount would have  been.  It was about.  It was $50,000 grand prize winner. 
[00:40:00]  Baby.  Frankie Blue.  We're going to give you a raise, and then we're going to fuck you.  You're going to fuck you, Jim.  Yeah, someone's going to reach their big hands in and just yank that salary right out of your  bank account.  Never went in.  Baby.  Baby.  So where are we?  So yeah, Frenchy's party just had, what, a little music playing, bright lights, and a  little cheese platter?  So I go right over.  I go right over, and Todd, my friend Todd's on K-Rock on Saturday night, so I start cranking  up, you know, his show a little bit, whoa, there's a baby that lives downstairs. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, no.  Why do you have a party on Saturday night if the baby's, you know, what, a baby downstairs?  I'm just annoyed at this point.  No music, no, no, no, I'm sitting there.  So Ben is texting, I erased all your messages because I, no, the only reason was he used  up all my memory.  He literally gave me 20 messages, Anthony.  Well, you said you were coming.  And what were they?  Where are you, you dick?  Stuff like that.  When you're coming.  That pretty much tells you right there.  No, that's what I'm getting at. 
[00:41:00]  Somebody save us.  I'm a little tired, right?  But I'm like, it's right there.  I should stop by.  Maybe, you know, honestly, I was thinking maybe you're going to be there, some people  from the show, maybe some people I haven't seen in a while.  Sure, it'll be fun, you know?  A little tired, but I'll make an appearance.  So he's text messaging me like crazy, and then he finally gets me on the phone.  He goes, where are you, dick?  And I'm like, Ben, I swear that's exactly what I said, because I hear no music, no  talk, and I go, Ben, it sounds like there's about 10 people there.  He goes, that's about right.  I'm like, and that's when I said, I'll be right over. 
[00:41:30]  You told him you'd be right over?  Jokingly, like, yeah, I'll be, I'm putting my shoes on right now.  Yeah, sure.  And then all night long, the text messages coming in.  It was just, because then you're trying to find it out.  So I'm sitting there with Kev.  Is it true that Earl, who's the most boring person alive, stayed for 10 minutes?  Earl?  Shut up.  And he's all, what?  It was like six minutes.  It was enough time to stuff down a piece of cake.  He didn't even take off his coat.  And Earl is always looking for something to do, because he's very lonely, has no friends.  He's always looking for someone to eat with or hang out with. 
[00:42:00]  Some ear to babble into.  So if he stayed for five or six minutes, you know it had to be just a complete drag.  Where are you going, Tuma?  Earl walked in, and then he yanked the honeybees over it, and everybody got stung.  So how'd you get out of it?  How'd you read?  I don't remember how I started to work out of it, but I said I had to go do something  else.  And I used Earl, I think it was an excuse.  I don't even remember.  You stayed.  What the hell did you do after I left?  I stayed for a little while.  And did anyone else show up? 
[00:42:30]  Because Frenchie's like, oh, more people are coming.  More people are coming.  And Ben takes his weekends very seriously, and then he gets ahold of me yesterday, and  he goes, it ruined my whole weekend.  Oh, Ben.  It ruined my whole Saturday night.  Oh.  It was just, you know.  It wasn't going to make page six, huh?  No, well, you know.  Page six.  Really maxed to sleep with his face in the cheese.  Page six, it wasn't going to make page 128.  You know those stupid little stories they put on, like, page 128?  Why would you go to that on a Saturday?  It's funny, like, last week they were like, you want a Frenchie's party? 
[00:43:00]  I almost didn't allow the statement to register for an answer.  What do you mean?  Don't allow it.  What?  No.  My head won't allow it.  Well, we went, what was it, last year?  I didn't go.  I was out of town, I think, last year.  But it was in a bar.  Yeah.  It was in a bar.  Down in the village last year.  Yeah, there was music playing.  There were more people there.  Frenchie's brother was, like, opening big bottles of champagne with swords.  He's taking a sword and hitting the top of the champagne bottle and a little glass thing,  and the cork go flying, and, you know, it was kind of showy. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, Frenchie's brother.  And this year it's in his apartment?  It's a new apartment, too.  This is a new place, you know.  Shh, there's a baby.  There's a baby.  Oh, that's hilarious.  There's a baby.  Wait a second.  I forgot, too.  So I brought a gift.  I'd never met his new girlfriend, so I figured, oh, this would be funny.  Remember how I was talking about the porn that the cleaning lady found the other day?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I put that in a nice bag and brought it in, and she was just, like, the worst.  Like, you know, these black chicks on the front, big black C, you know, stuff like that.  Nice.  Oh, you're so nice.  A gift.  He's opened up.  A thoughtful gift.  By the way, if you're ever at a party and you're afraid you're going to wake the baby, 
[00:44:00]  you know how you solve that?  Just watch the last five minutes of Caligula.  That's how you take care of that little pesky brat.  Jesus.  Grab it by the feet.  It's the same guy that tells me, you know, off air, I really would like a girlfriend.  Yeah, exactly.  She gets pregnant.  We all know what's going to happen.  Trips a daisy down the steps.  Trips a daisy.  Hey, this is Keith the Cop.  While you're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony, I'm watching Tippy Tom shitting 
[00:44:30]  the garbage.  He's up on the gay shit.  Oh, Jim.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Look who's in the studio.  I see.  Frenchie.  Mark.  Frenchie.  You're back.  What are you doing here?  You're back.  You did not come on Saturday night.  You came to reprimand everybody for not showing up at your party?  Yeah, Frenchie threw himself a birthday party.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  No one showed up beside Ben and drunk Billy Mac. 
[00:45:00]  I heard it was a real Mary Tyler Moore type of party.  Just a horrible dud.  Almost, but he saved the day.  Better parties at the Anne Frank house up in the attic.  More action.  Shh.  Shh.  He took a page out of...  They're downstairs.  He took a...  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday.  Shh.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Shh.  We don't have...  They're coming in.  We don't have any candles.  Blow some dust off my finger. 
[00:45:30]  And then the stupid uncle, what did you wish for?  You fag.  The sound of jackboots downstairs.  Where is he in the closet?  Shh.  Tell me what you wished for.  I just want to run through a field.  Well, I don't think that will happen.  You'll die two weeks before we get out of here, stupid...  Stupid...  The Anne Frank party.  Yeah, because there was a baby sleeping downstairs or something. 
[00:46:00]  Is that right, Mark?  Well, yeah, downstairs, yes.  Is it downstairs?  Yeah.  So you were telling everybody to be quiet?  Well, pretty much so, yeah.  It's not my apartment, so yes.  They will hear you.  Hey, what are you going to do on the 31st?  Are you going to write Happy New Year's on a paper and hold it up at everyone else at  the party?  That stinks.  Pull out all the little metal things in the noise makers that make the sound?  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep. 
[00:46:30]  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  God damn it, man.  Oh, that's classic.  Happy New Year.  Put that down.  A half-track pulls up in front of your house. 
[00:47:00]  Do Nazis get out?  Beheads, there was a party upstairs.  Half-Frenchy.  You're going to go see all the coats on pile up in the bed, and when you lift up the bed,  there's going to be somebody who's tied themselves underneath the bed, who's the girl with the  red dress running in and out of the rooms in the party?  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Oh.  Very good.  Yeah.  And, uh, well, Ben went to Mark's party.  Yes, he did, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, he said, I gotta be blunt. 
[00:47:30]  That it sucked.  And that it ruined his whole weekend.  Not only his whole weekend.  Not only his night, it ruined his whole weekend.  He had to keep thinking about how bad it was that it ruined his whole weekend.  Ben goes to parties that end up in page six in the newspaper.  He throws parties that end up in page six.  Usually, he's sitting at a table with a very well-known celebrity.  Uh, these are parties that the public can't really get into.  So, he really knows New York parties. 
[00:48:00]  Uh, oh, you guys are such dicks.  So, he goes to yours.  What's the matter?  What's wrong, Ben?  I feel bad.  He's right here.  You said it's so much easier when he's out of the studio.  He said his birthday party stunk, and it's...  I love Frenchie.  You should have no problem trashing him in front of everybody in the office.  Yeah, I wasn't trying.  I was trying to tell him how bad his stupid party was.  Dude, there was five people there.  Billy Mac was drinking a little cheese on the thing.  Little phone.  There's no way Tom Brady would come to this party and do coke. 
[00:48:30]  Hey, where's my water bottle cap?  I'm talking into it.  Tom Brady was fucked.  He was doing interceptions.  He was drunk from Frenchie's party.  I know.  I know, because I know all.  You're such a gossip.  It was fun with Billy.  You know, you're the party planner.  Why don't you explain to Frenchie why the parties suck?  Maybe next year he can do a better job if you let him in on...  Because he took a page out of your playbook.  Ben has been throwing his own birthday party for many years, and a lot of people get very  excited when they get the invite to Ben's parties. 
[00:49:00]  We do.  Remember the one up at King's in Boston?  That was an amazing one.  Yeah, I did do it last year.  The one at the Happy Ending place down there in the village, or where were you on that one?  Lower East Side.  Lower East Side, okay.  Yes, Frenchie.  Well, first problem, Frenchie, was the lights were on.  Yeah, you had all your lights on.  I didn't put them on.  I came to work that night.  You need some type of mood lighting, whether it's some kind of colored gel filters on the  lights, perhaps some strategically placed safe candles that are up in places that kind 
[00:49:30]  of set a mood.  A vibe.  Even a piece of red material thrown over your lamp can make it look that much better inside  your apartment.  Thank you, Martha Stewart.  Yeah.  What do you mean you didn't put them on?  That you just walked home and you went...  Yeah, pretty much so, yeah.  Clapper.  Ah, very good.  So the lights were on.  Yeah.  Lights were on.  There was no music on.  Why no music?  Because of the baby.  No, she put the music on later. 
[00:50:00]  It was on very low.  It was on two.  It was on about two.  Would you have light at him playing?  Yeah, pretty.  This is great.  I mean, this is great.  You were nowhere to be fun, huh?  You're a fag.  I was home sleeping.  And I was...  Opie's the one that was right down the block.  And he's telling me that, you know, yeah, they're going to come by.  They're going to come by. 
[00:50:30]  I knew Anthony...  If it was on a Friday night, I could see Anthony coming.  I'm in great neck now.  I can't go out at night.  I figured as much.  He wasn't coming.  But he said he was coming.  So he made it go.  Frenchie, I had every intention of going to your birthday party.  That is a fact.  And then Ben calls me, and it sounded like there was absolutely no one there.  So I go, Ben, it sounds like there's ten people at the party.  And Ben goes, that's about right.  Frenchie, how many people showed up?  We included eight.  Wow, you included. 
[00:51:00]  Now, you and your girlfriend included.  Yeah.  So you're talking six guests.  That's actually four plus Ben, and that includes Ben's bulge.  Which was accidentally counted twice.  It was, yeah.  And Billy, well, Billy was the entertainment.  Was he the life of the party?  Oh, yeah, he was, yeah.  He was already fucked up when he got there.  Yeah.  And then he drank five beers within, what, 15 minutes?  And then he was just standing and sitting down.  And then Earl showed up. 
[00:51:30]  Earl, the life of the party showed up.  Oh, yeah, yeah, he showed up.  But I heard Earl didn't even stick around.  Well, Earl bolted on you.  Right?  Earl had better things to do.  At the same time.  How could Earl have better things to do?  Well, you know, Ben grabs his phone and says, okay, let me call somebody.  Let me call somebody.  You were trying to get people over there for him?  No.  Trying to make it happen.  Well, it was late by that point.  I mean, I don't know.  It was after.  You kept me in Oak away.  You said the party stunk, so he didn't go.  I didn't go.  That's the only reason I didn't go.  I didn't call you, Jim.  No, but Oak told me.  He told me, like, Ben said the party stinks. 
[00:52:00]  I'm like, all right, whatever.  Ben did tell me, too, that the party stinks.  So why would I go?  He said there's no music.  The lights are on.  Too many lights.  There's cheese out.  And we can't be loud because of the baby.  Oh, great.  And the guy that owns serious stock.  There was the guy that owns serious stock.  Oh, yeah, that jackass.  Yeah, well, he's kind of my brother.  At least he showed up.  Well, he did.  Yeah, my brother was supposed to show up, too, and he didn't show up.  Your brother?  Your own brother?  Oh, man.  Your own brother?  He had a fight with his girlfriend in the car, so you drive the car, because he's already  had so many.  Oh, you believe that excuse? 
[00:52:30]  He just didn't have to go to your stupid party.  Oh, my God.  Even family members blown off your birthday.  He was a hit last year, your party last year, which was in a bar.  It was in a bar, yeah.  It was fun.  Your brother was popping the champagne bottles with the knife.  Sword.  Uh-huh.  He's like, bang.  It was a fun party.  Why did you have it in your apartment this year?  Well, I didn't know.  I came from work, so I didn't know where to go after work, so it was a pain in the ass.  Did you learn from Opie?  Did you have some stuff for your party guests to eat? 
[00:53:00]  I made some things, yeah.  Now, you're a very good chef.  What did you make?  I made a cheese platter with four different cheeses and some dry sausages cut up in pieces.  That was the crappy plate of cheese that Ben must have been talking about.  Wow, and some dried sausage.  Dried sausage?  My mother sent me that.  Every year I get that thing that has to be refrigerated immediately, it has cheese in  it, and some dried, awful sausage.  You don't want that.  No.  They were dry Italian sausages. 
[00:53:30]  Earl, the life of the party showed up.  Oh, yeah, yeah, he showed up.  But I heard Earl didn't even stick around.  Oh, Earl bolted on you, right?  Earl had better things to do?  No, you had better things to do at the same time.  How could Earl have better things to do?  Well, you know, Ben grabs his phone and says, okay, let me call somebody.  Let me call somebody.  You were trying to get people over there for him?  No, I was trying to make it happen.  Well, it was late by that point.  I mean, I don't know.  It was after two months.  You kept me in Opie, you said the party stunk, so he didn't go, I didn't go.  That's the only reason I didn't go.  I didn't call you, Jim.  No, but Opie told me.  He told me, he's like, Ben said the party stinks.  I'm like, all right, whatever. 
[00:54:00]  Ben did tell me, too, that the party stinks.  He said there's no music, the lights are on, too many lights.  There's cheese out, and we can't be glad because of the baby.  Oh, correct.  And the guy that owns serious stock.  That was the guy that owns serious stock.  Oh, yeah, that jackass.  Yeah, well, he's a friend of my brother.  At least he showed up.  Well, he did.  Yeah, my brother was supposed to show up, too, and he didn't show up.  Your own brother?  Oh, man.  Your own brother?  He had a fight with his girlfriend in the car, so you drive the car, because he's already  had some in the streets.  Oh, you believe that excuse? 
[00:54:30]  He just didn't go to your stupid party.  Oh, my God.  Even family members blown off your birthday.  He was a hit last year, your party last year, which was in a bar.  It was in a bar, yes.  It was fun.  Your brother was popping the champagne bottles with the knife sword.  Uh-huh.  He's like, bang.  It was a fun party.  Why did you have it in your apartment this year?  Well, I didn't know.  I came from work, so I didn't know where to go after work, so it was a pain, yes.  Did you learn from Opie?  Did you have some stuff for your party guests to eat? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, I made some things, yeah.  Now, you're a very good chef.  What did you make?  I made a cheese powder with four different cheeses and some dry sausages cut up in pieces.  That was the crappy plate of cheese that Ben must have been talking about.  Wow.  And some dried sausage.  Dried sausage?  My mother sent me that.  Every year I get that thing that has to be refrigerated immediately, it has cheese in  it, and some dried, awful sausage.  You don't want that.  No.  They were dry Italian sausages. 
[00:55:30]  Ugh, what are you, a Hickory Farms representative?  That's terrible.  You're a chef.  You're a chef.  Why don't you whip up something good?  Some pastries.  Well, we had a nice birthday cake for, what, 30 people, so we ended up eating only a quarter  of it.  You're still eating cake.  It's still in the freezer.  It's got a freezer burn.  You can still read Happy Birthday to Mar on it.  Did you get any good gifts?  I gave you gifts.  Yeah, yeah.  Ben gave me... 
[00:56:00]  I brought gifts.  Billy brought gifts.  What'd you get them?  What'd you bring them?  I re-wrapped the porno that Steve gave me.  Oh, that's disgusting porno.  A re-wrap of pornography.  It was the worst awful porn ever, too.  Too bad you couldn't give him what he needed.  Bring a box with 25 fun people in it.  You son of a bitch.  What else did you get?  Billy bought me a bottle of champagne.  Billy?  Billy, yeah.  Oh, Billy.  Was it half drank by the time you gave it to me?  I spilled it in my mouth.  Didn't Billy used to hate you? 
[00:56:30]  Not Billy.  Well, you remember the original.  Billy reminded me of this whole story.  I forgot about it.  When originally...  Do you remember when we were taking the sound...  Rick and I would take the sound clips and we'd prank call people?  Yeah.  But some people didn't think it was as funny as we thought it was?  Yeah.  And we prank called Billy with Frenchie clips.  And then Billy threatened to drive a truck through his restaurant.  Yeah.  And called the owner of the restaurant.  And then Anthony got mad.  And then we never played it.  But...  I got mad?  Well, we were mad because...  Because the guy was going to fire Frenchie.  Did we have Frenchie versus Frenchie?  The guy was going to fire Frenchie. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, I was like...  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, I didn't get mad.  I just said, you got to let him off the hook.  Because he's going to fire the guy.  And I eat there.  Well, Billy, I mean...  Again, interfering with my life.  I remember Billy being like, I'm going to drive a fucking truck through your restaurant.  And he's saying that to my boss.  And my boss is running down and says, who the fuck is this guy?  I'm like, I have no fucking idea who this is.  This is crazy.  And then he calls Mike and says, well, if you want, you want to get him at 10 o'clock at night.  That's when he gets out.  Yeah, you should have a party at like a...  In the back room of the restaurant. 
[00:57:30]  Next year, do something fun.  Maybe if you can book the library.  Everybody can curl up and read a good book.  Okay, everybody.  Now for a lesson on the Dewey Decimal System.  Sock it.  B-Y-O-N.  It's a bring your own afghan.  Everybody curl up under one and just read a good book.  Yeah.  God damn it, man.  Cheeses in the 800 section, pure science. 
[00:58:00]  Well, we have Billy Mac on the phone.  Oh.  Billy Mac.  I should have driven that truck through your fucking restaurant.  Shut up, you fuck face.  Dickhead.  And that sausage was, I think, dried mule would have been better.  Listen, you were so fucked up, you had no idea where you were anyway.  So shut up.  Look, let me tell you, you're lucky that Ben and I showed up and forget about Earl, but  you know.  Well, it can do nothing about him.  Billy, I heard it was just an awful party.  Well, I'm going to tell you, I had more fun in the fucking communion, I think. 
[00:58:30]  You son of a bitch.  Hey, Billy, was anyone making noise and like laughing real loud or no?  Jimmy, you couldn't, you weren't allowed to.  I brought Frenchie a bottle of champagne and he was like nervous about uncorking it.  So I put a freaking towel around the top.  You didn't even let the champagne pop.  I did, he's lying.  It would wake the baby.  It's like a dead load coming out, you know, just like dribble, dribble.  Wow.  What do you do with that baby?  You take him to the back of the bus and you smother him because the enemy will hear you. 
[00:59:00]  You pretend he's a chicken.  You pretend he's a chicken, everything will be fine.  Nobody could have hid under any coats because there was only five people there.  Not enough coats.  I'll get you for that, you fucking Billy.  That was a great party.  I got lost on the way home.  I made a wrong turn.  I ended up in Harlem.  You did?  Yeah, about 109.  I was trying to pay attention to see, make sure I wouldn't like go over the yellow lines.  And next thing I know, I was on 109th Street.  At least it was a little excitement.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:59:30]  All right, Mark, do me a favor.  Don't ever invite me again.  And Ben, next time you have one in a happy ending, Hula House, I'm with you, brother.  Yeah, Ben knows how to throw the birthday parties.  Leave the birthday parties to Ben, Frenchy.  Okay, he's going to do it next year.  Henri!  Bye, Billy.  I wake up just now next to Frenchy's girlfriend to hear him on the radio.  I thought you were done with him.  Okay, let me ask you something.  I thought you said goodbye to this guy.  He walked off in the sunset last time we listened, and he was done because he got shot down by me. 
[01:00:00]  Do we all remember that?  I remember.  And now he's back in the studio?  I don't understand.  Yeah, that's right.  You're behind your phone, and I'm here.  So why don't you come over and suck my dick, you fucking fag?  Because I've already had my dick sucked this morning by your girlfriend.  I woke up.  Yeah, that's right.  It's going to be hard to do when you're in California, you dickface.  Why don't you shut your head in a little while and pay for her cab and send her back to you.  Why don't you shut your hole, you fuck?  Piece of shit, throw a party and no one comes. 
[01:00:30]  You lame ass party.  You lame ass party.  Why don't you come over, you piece of shit?  Stupid asshole.  Put a better accent, you fuckface.  This is the only accent I have, you fucking prick.  Yeah, you fucking prick.  I'm going to ass-fuck your girlfriend.  Anytime.  And I'm going to send her back to you to your lame party where no one shows up.  With your two-inch dick, you can keep it between your legs, you fucking fag, like a little dog.  You like a little dog, like you get beaten.  Oh, he's gone.  Henri knows when to punch out.  Yeah, Henri, Henri. 
[01:01:00]  People wondering if Frenchy was serving donkey sausage at the party.  No.  And others suggesting that perhaps Fallujah is more fun than one of your parties.  Do you feel bad that no one went to your party?  Yeah, a little bit, but that's okay.  It doesn't matter.  That's why I have another year after that.  It's my party and I'll cry if I want to.  So you look forward to it, and then when do you finally realize that it's going to be a night of friendless humiliation? 
[01:01:30]  Like at what point when people are starting to come, like, well, everyone's just running late, it's cold.  I will lure people with my good food.  Now, when did you realize, though?  Like, what time did the party start?  Yeah, when did it start getting uncomfortable where you're pacing your apartment going, oh, no, no one's showing.  11, 11.30.  What time did it start?  10.  And then 11.30, you're like, what, no one's coming.  My party is a flop.  When did you realize?  Yeah, 11.30.  11.30 was like, this blows. 
[01:02:00]  You threw the heaven's gate at parties.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  Hey, John.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Happy birthday to me.  Happy birthday to me.  Happy birthday to Frenchie.  I'm all alone in front of my cake with one candle in it.  Hello? 
[01:02:30]  Is this a guest calling to say you're showing up?  No.  Is Bill there?  No.  Wrong number.  Happy birthday to me.  Au revoir.  Did you blow the candle out, or did the tear drip on it?  There was no candle on the cake.  That's it.  Trying to blow out the candle. 
[01:03:00]  Why was there no candle on the cake?  Because my friend bought the cake, and he didn't bring any candles.  Oh, God.  This is how good friends they are.  Not even candles on your cake.  Who needs them?  If he had any real dignity, he would have put dynamite in it and just ended that party.  Wiped out that awful, fun-blocking baby on the next floor.  John in Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to say, hey, Frenchie, maybe next time you throw a party, you can hand  a fucking gun out at the door to put people out of their misery before the party even 
[01:03:30]  gets started.  Ooh.  Don't worry about it.  That will be done next time.  Next time.  Well, maybe you can just shoot yourself and save the embarrassment for next year.  Why don't you bring me a gun, you stupid fuck?  Oh, just tell me where you live.  I'll have a gun ready.  Yeah, I know you do.  All right, I'm punching out guys.  What does that mean?  This is Marion.  Marion, come back.  Marion is channeling you today.  Eric from Virginia, what's up?  Yeah, I think before any foreign people come to the States,  you should have to learn how to, you know, cuss right. 
[01:04:00]  It's a shame when you hear, you know, these French people or anybody,  they're like, are you stupid fuck bitch?  That's not how you thought.  You're in the States.  Stupid fuck bitch.  You're right.  Those are the most fun words you can learn in the beginning.  Do you realize if you did George Carlin's seven dirty words,  that could represent every person at your party?  You'll be shit, you'll be pissed, you'll be cunt, you'll be motherfucker,  you'll be tits.  Seven people.  Oh, did you guys have the TV on?  I feel bad.  No. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, no TV?  No music?  You wake the baby.  Ben, how uncomfortable was it?  It was just, I mean, I don't, I mean, it's just, there was no action.  Were you all sitting?  Yeah, we were sitting down.  Nobody's standing and talking to each other?  Not really, you know, it was, you know, there was not much going on.  How big of an apartment is it?  It's not very big.  You got a good size bedroom for a New York apartment,  but it's about the size of the studio.  Wow.  Yeah, I mean, it's, you know.  Seven people.  In this room?  Milling about in this room. 
[01:05:00]  Kev was in court, Kev had court.  Can one more person come in?  Oh, and that will be, we will recreate the party?  Yeah, we have six people in here.  Don't send Mike, though, because he won't come in until after we leave.  Five after ten, he'll walk away.  Because he doesn't know what go, go, go means.  Danny just walked in, so now we have a full.  This is what the party looks like.  Right here, we have as many people.  Oh, wow, this is really sad.  It really is.  Son of a bitch.  He looks pretty sad today, too. 
[01:05:30]  Wow.  You didn't have enough people at your party for one softball team.  No, not even.  You're right.  Go ahead and play the infield.  Scott from Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, Frenchy.  Yeah.  Frenchy.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Who's on the hotline?  Who's on the hotline?  All right, no one, I guess.  All right, Frenchy.  Who's on the hotline?  No, they're gone now. 
[01:06:00]  Geez, I'm sorry.  Maybe next year.  You've got to live and learn.  I liked going to your party last year.  That was pretty good.  We're in the bar.  Thanks for the warning this year, Ben.  You were right.  Was there alcohol at your...  Yeah, champagne.  Beer.  Champagne.  Beer.  Wine.  I mean, I had everything.  Yeah, no hard liquor.  I had vodka in the freezer.  Yeah, vodka in the freezer.  Okay.  Ready for an evening of fun.  And cheese, some dried sausage, and Ben's hog.  And you should have had chocolate, the same one that Hitler ate in the bunker. 
[01:06:30]  That would have given everybody a nice way out of that party.  You hear a solitary shot from his bedroom.  They all light up in his apartment.  The funeral is dead.  Well, it sounds great.  I'm sorry I missed it.  It was, you know, with my schedule, I can't commit to anything.  I know.  You're too busy on the weekend.  Sleeping.  What did you do instead of go to Frenchie's party? 
[01:07:00]  I believe it was about 8 o'clock at night at one point, and my girlfriend said, you know,  Mark's party is at 9.  And I said something like, yeah, I know.  And that was about it.  End of conversation.  The thought of dragging my ass out.  There was nothing else.  That was the end of the conversation.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, I know.  To get into the truck and then drive all the way into Manhattan.  I'm in Great Neck now, by the way.  It's very hard.  It's not like when I was in Brooklyn, which was a pain in the ass.  Yeah, but Great Neck is not that far.  Come on, give me a break.  Wait.  Dude, just accept the excuse.  The sun was down.  I had to stay in the house.  You don't want to know the real reason.  Jesus.  Figure it out.  Yeah, you know, I was kind of, you know, sitting around in my own filth.  So I would have had to take a shower.  It was just like.  You were in for the evening. 
[01:08:00]  Opie had called me and said Ben called and said the party just socked.  Yep, that's what kept me away.  Ben really cock-blocked your party.  Yeah.  If Ben didn't pick up his phone, there would have been at least 12 people there.  Dude, there's no one here.  There would have been 12 people there if Ben didn't start making his stupid phone calls.  I asked Ben, I go, you know, give me something I can compare it to as far as fun.  And Ben said he had more fun sitting on the toilet when he had food poisoning than he had at your party.  When he was old gravy leg, he was having more fun. 
[01:08:30]  Son of a bitch that you are.  All right, well.  All right, Frenchy.  Maybe next year.  Frenchy, good appearance.  Good job.  Yep.  Yeah, okay.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, it's in my shoes.  Ramone, clean this up.  Say, Jim, what nice feels.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  There's some sexual reference.  James.  Here I am.  James Remar.  It's James Remar. 
[01:09:00]  Good morning.  How are you, buddy?  It's early.  Yes, it is.  Are you in L.A.?  I'm on the West Coast.  Oh, my God.  Then it is really ridiculous early.  The sun isn't up.  You're going to do this all day, aren't you?  No.  He goes, no?  He's like right back to bed after this one.  I'm in bed.  Oh, you are?  He's still in bed.  Ooh, James Remar in bed.  Yeah.  What are you wearing?  Nothing.  Thanks for the visual. 
[01:09:30]  My favorite outfit.  This is the part where he's in bed with the girl and Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte barge in,  try to shoot him.  God damn, I love this guy.  I loved it.  48 Hours, by the way.  You are the best villain ever, ever in any movie.  Gans.  Thank you.  I mean, probably most recognized for that one, I bet, right?  Well, since Sex and the City, it's been sexy for a while.  Yeah, because that's what I'm hearing from everybody.  They're like, oh, yeah, you seem in Sex and the City.  And to tell you the truth, I wasn't a big fan of the Sex and the City show. 
[01:10:00]  A lot of chicks watch that.  But I would go, oh, that guy knows.  I'd rather be more popular with them than you anyway.  Of course you would.  We're in the Warriors too, right?  Yeah, he's in the Warriors.  He was the guy that was like, oh, why are you trying to pick up the chick in the park,  you idiot, stay with your boys.  And then he gets handcuffed to the bench and the cops come.  The lust factor.  Yeah, I know.  You couldn't keep it in your pants.  Well, I could.  It's just it was pulling me in a certain direction.  What did he do on Sex and the City? 
[01:10:30]  Ben knows.  You watched that girl show, didn't you, Ben?  I hope he does too.  He probably has a girlfriend and he watched me do that.  Yeah, exactly.  Let's just put it this way.  I gave up on Sex and the City.  He got to bang Kim Cattrall on the show.  One of the many, I guess, that banged Kim Cattrall.  But I did it consistently.  Oh, you were like the steady kind of?  Yeah, I was a boyfriend.  Yeah.  Did you have to do scenes with her kind of naked in bed?  Kind of, yeah.  It was completely naked in bed?  Well, she looks really hot for her age, man. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, so do I.  We already had gotten to that, James.  We were talking about that.  You're laying in that Hollywood bed of yours right now.  I'm actually overlooking Hollywood Boulevard.  Oh, I love it.  I'm looking for where the premiere was last night.  Oh, yeah.  You're in Blade, right?  Mm-hmm.  I love the Blade movies.  One and two are great.  What's the spin on this one?  This is, how do you mean the spin?  Yeah, what's like the storyline on this one? 
[01:11:30]  Well, it's a Blade movie.  It's Vampires vs. Blade.  And what are you?  I'm actually the real world.  I play an FBI guy who doesn't believe in vampires.  Really?  And then I guess you kind of get convinced.  Yeah, at the end, at the end, I'm convinced.  It's just this incredible body count.  Can you give us the ending of the movie?  I'm convinced.  He's convinced.  We're all convinced by the end. 
[01:12:00]  That's the end.  You didn't have to learn any sword play like the rest of the guys, did you?  Unfortunately not.  That would have been great.  That is pretty cool, man.  They're swinging those things around.  Those movies are really good.  That would have been a blast.  I'd love to have done that.  Is everybody else from the other movies, aside from those that saw Sunlight and Burnt Away,  are they coming back?  The ones that are all ashed away already?  Yeah.  I don't know how they could.  Well, not them.  The other ones, though.  Like, what's-his-name is in that?  No, Wesley Snipes. 
[01:12:30]  I know.  He's like the start.  What's-his-name is coming back.  What's-his-name will be back.  No, Wesley Snipes.  What's-his-name and who's-her-face?  They'll both be back.  No, who's the Bobby McGee author guy?  Oh, Chris Christopherson.  Chris Christopherson.  I can never remember that son of a bitch's name.  God.  You know, he has nothing but nice things to say about you.  Oh, and I badmouth him like that.  I know him as the Bobby McGee author guy.  What a dick.  I stink.  I'm going to remind him, because I think he's going to be on our show in the coming days.  Is he really?  Chris Christopherson is, yeah, he's in it. 
[01:13:00]  He's back, so we'll see the whole cast.  Very good.  What else are you working on, Jay?  I'm doing North Shore for Fox.  We're finishing up the season over there in Hawaii.  I'm going back this morning, actually.  Cool.  What a life.  You know, we were in the middle of playing Guess What's in My Pants with a fatty from Jacksonville,  and we interrupted the call to talk to you.  I don't know if that's a good thing or not.  Sure.  Is Gans and the Warriors, are they like the things that you're most recognized for? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Well, with old guys like you, now the kids.  Now the kids.  Well, no, like I was saying, there's a few James Remar fans out there who know everything,  but most everybody pretty much knows the Warriors and the 48 Hours, like you said.  But lately, Sex and the City gave me a new level of recognizability.  I mean, that's good.  Also, you didn't get typecasts and stuff, because you were pretty much the premier bad guy scumbag of the 80s. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Well, there are some lesser-known flicks kicking around, and where I am scumbagging it around pretty happily.  I've been wanting to ask you this for a long time.  When you shot Luther on that bus, did you shoot him just because he asked the girl if she was okay,  and you said she'd be okay?  I always wondered, if he didn't ask, are you okay, would Gans have shot him?  History, man.  Who can tell? 
[01:14:30]  What a dick question that was.  I think he needed shooting.  Of course he did.  Very good.  At that particular point, he really needed shooting.  Wait, someone wants to say hi to you.  Yeah, she might have been with you.  Yeah, she might have been with you.  Oh, girl.  Nice.  Janine, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say hi to James Nemora.  I'm such a big fan since the Ajax days.  Oh, cool.  I'm a fan of yours, too.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Ajax, lighten up.  That's all we say at my house constantly.  Constantly.  That's it. 
[01:15:00]  What a household.  Yeah, we're losers.  We're losers.  That's funny.  We're chasing each other around.  Chasing each other around the park.  Yeah, I'm sick of waiting for trains.  That's all right.  As long as you don't live with a black guy and yell riff.  Riffs.  They were cool.  Hell, yeah.  I had no idea you were going to be on the show.  I almost drove off the road.  I'm so glad there was an accident on 135.  I think we've got to start promoting the fact that we're going to have big names on our show.  I know.  That would be good.  Very cool.  All right.  Thank you, Janine. 
[01:15:30]  Thank you.  All right.  I think James can get back to sleep now.  We've got Blade, Trinity.  I've been asleep this whole time.  Yeah, I know.  Well, that's why we're saying go back.  No, I'm just kidding.  It's awesome.  Check out James and Blade, Trinity.  Yeah, please do.  When does that come out?  Today.  Is it out?  It comes out today, right?  Yeah, I think today is the opening day.  Is it getting good reviews?  I don't even know.  Beg pardon?  Is it getting good reviews, the movie?  Hell, yeah.  Blade movies are huge, man.  I'm just asking. 
[01:16:00]  They're huge.  Don't be an ass.  I haven't read the reviews.  We just saw it last night, and it's full of action.  That's for sure.  All right, good.  Cole, thanks a lot, James.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There he goes.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Take care, man.  James Remar.  James Remar, dude.  This is what an idiot I am.  I saw the picture, and I didn't recognize that he was Gans.  Gans!  Or Ajax.  I had no idea.  If I'm looking through the thing, I'm like, oh, this guy's got 75 credits.  Gans was the best character in a movie.  Yeah.  Nice gun, and he just shoots the guy. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  Just a scumbag.  Just a creep.  Him with the Indian guy with the big knife.  Oh, the movie's great.  I miss you more than Michael Bay missed the mark when he made Pearl Harbor. 
[01:17:00]  I miss you more than that movie missed the point, and that's an awful lot, girl.  And now, now you've gone away, and all I'm trying to say is Pearl Harbor sucked, and I miss you.  I need you like Ben Affleck needs acting school. 
[01:17:30]  He was terrible in that film.  I need you like Kuba Goody needed a bigger heart  He's way better than Ben Affleck and now  All I can think about is your smile  And that shitty movie too  For all the songs  And I miss you 
[01:18:00]  Why does Michael beg it  To keep on making movies  I guess Pearl Harbor sucked  Just a little bit more than I miss you 
[01:18:30]  For seven cents a day  You can get Opie and Anthony  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face  But you want to laugh don't you  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children  So turn him up and turn on Opie and Anthony  And we'll send you a photo of the child 
[01:19:00]  You're healthy in the outfit of your choice  The Opie and Anthony Show  Here's Opie and Anthony  When they don't suck  Good for what ails you  What what  The worst of Opie and Anthony  Hey we got that guy from 98 Degrees calling in in a few minutes  We're starting to get guests on the show Anthony  Have you noticed?  Slowly but surely  It's that guy  It's Jeff Timmons  It's not Nick Lachey  That's why I said that guy  And then I'm thinking everyone's going to just stay tuned  Thinking they got Nick and they get Jeff instead 
[01:19:30]  We get like the other guy from Wham guy  We always get the other guy  Yeah  Whatever his name was  What the hell was his name?  Who?  Who was the other guy from Wham?  It's George Michael  Is this another gay quiz?  If you know the answer you're gay  Oh hey look who's on the phone  What?  Oh hey  I didn't know you  Hey Jeff  Yeah  You're talking to Opie and Anthony  We didn't know you were calling right now  But that's fine  What's going on buddy?  I don't know  I just got this message that I was supposed to call you 
[01:20:00]  Sorry I'm the other guy  You know you could get Nick  He's the cooler guy  No no not at all man  Let me tell you something  You weren't supposed to hear any of that shit  No no no no no  Why are you putting these people through  When they're on hold  And while we're bad mouthing people?  Don't you know protocol?  I was on TV the other day  You know you guys can go ahead  You know the protocol guys  You don't let them listen to the pre-interview  I like that  No Jeff  Unless you take the temperature  Of how it's going to be  When I'm on the air with you guys  No no  See now  Jeff  No  We got off to a bit  No Jeff 
[01:20:30]  Trust me we're going to get along  I guarantee it  You got a solo CD coming out  Whisper that way  See there you go  There's a plug and everything  Oh yeah  Alright cool  Alright  If you really want to get into this  I'll tell you something  I think Nick is kind of pussy whipped  You think?  I think  I don't find Nick cool whatsoever  I thought you were going to say  You don't find him cute  I think Nick is not getting  Good sex at home  You don't think?  Not at all man  Not at all 
[01:21:00]  It's hard to say man  And I don't think he's getting  Stimulating conversation  I do believe  Stimulating conversation  And I do believe he's quite bored  I think he's quite bored  And he just wants to start  Banging whatever he can again  It could be  I wouldn't know though  I don't know too much about that  Hey let me ask you a question  Does it get annoying  That like the one guy in the band  Is like the biggest name  Does that ever get to be aggravating?  Not at all  Not a bit man  You know it's like  I mean you gotta think about  What he's doing to become  The biggest name  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:21:30]  Do you know you just  Jimmy Norton just asked  The same question  That Larry King  Asked Motley Crue  About Tommy Lee  Yeah  What are you doing?  Oh  Well I was  You know  Nick Lachey  How does it make you feel  That he's more popular?  Yeah did you hear that Larry  He did man  He sounded kind of like  That's good  I like that  Did you hear Larry King  Talking to Motley Crue  The other day  It was quite embarrassing there Jeff  And what he said  How do you feel like  Who did he say  He asked the rest of  Yeah he asked the rest of the band  He asked them 
[01:22:00]  You know  Hey does it make you mad  That Tommy Lee  Got more popular  After the band broke up  Well I'm asking this  Do you think he really cares  Those guys really care  At this point  That's pretty much  What they said  That's pretty much  What they said  To Larry King  It's like Larry  That's a dumb question  And Norton  Just asked the same  And you know what  Well I was only asking  Because he came in  While you were  Saying the other guy  That's why I was asking  No we were joking  About the other  We were joking  About the other guy  I think Jeff  And I heard  What you were saying  It depends on  What you do  To become more famous  Because when  98 Degrees was out 
[01:22:30]  Nick wasn't  Looked at as  Wild the guy  He became the guy  Because of the stupid  MTV show  That I  I have to watch  Because it's so stupid  Hey she's  She's really hot  She's really hot  But she's dumb  Do you ever  You ever meet her  Do you guys really  Think she's that dumb  Come on man  Again she's making  Lots of money  And she's a big star  She can't be  Yeah but it's not  All about money  Come on you know that  What's it about  Chicks  Getting pussy 
[01:23:00]  These guys must have  Done very well  What was that like man  Being in one of those  You know  Boy bands  One of those boy bands  You know  One of those  Manufactured pop groups  Girls just throwing  Themselves at you  Girls throwing  No man  We were real  Conservative guys  You know  We never experienced  Anything like that  Yeah I'm sure  Yeah but it had to be  Frustrating too  Because a lot of the  Girls were way  Underage  I mean have you

[01:27:30]  Which one is  That's when you are  Performing there  Jim Norton is a comedian  There Jeff  And he's going to be  At the downtown  On Long Island  On December 23rd  It's just like  I wish I could be  In town to check that out  I might be in town for that  Yeah it's just like  Selling out arenas  You know  Except for the arena  Yeah  And the thousands  Of screaming fans  That's true  Instead of  Don't forget  They're all young  And prepubescent  I was going to say  Instead of hot teenage girls  Norton gets  People that might be  Homosexual  Guys who crash  The Danza message board  That's all  My fan base 
[01:28:00]  The only thing I sell out  Is my art  Jeff  Am I  Am I hearing in your voice  That there were  Other women  That were at these gigs  Aside from just  Prepubescent girls  Oh you should have  Showed up at one  You might have been  You might have been  Surprised  If I showed up  At a 98 Degrees  Concert  No offense  My friend  My  Is this  Opium or Anthony  It's Anthony  If you showed up  At a 98 Degrees concert  You might actually  Get laid  Yeah see  He just got me  On that one  He's right  Yeah  No I would not  Be getting laid  At one of those 
[01:28:30]  Concerts  Jeff you're married  Now with two kids  Right  I'm divorced  But I have two kids  Oh no  Oh you poor  Bastard  Now you got something  In common with Anthony  Except for the two kids  This thing  How much money  How much money what  Did you get killed  Of course you get killed  And it was you  Up on that stage  It's you singing  You earning that money  And then all of a sudden  Give me half of it  Hey man  You can always make more money  But you can't always be saved  For the rest of your life  That's

[01:29:30]  Yeah  It's a tough business  To be married in  You know  You're always traveling  Or you know  You're always doing something  That you have to be  With someone that's really  Very secure with themselves  Did she catch you  Doing anything crazy  Absolutely not  I was completely  Completely faithful  The entire time I was with her  You were faithful the whole time  Absolutely  But she just couldn't take you  Being away  Very tough  She was very tough  Yeah  Did she get all raggy on you Jeff  No  She was a doll  I love it 
[01:30:00]  I told you we would like you  By the end of this  Let me ask you a question  This has got to be frustrating  As a comic  You don't meet a lot of chicks  But I know singers get laid all the time  When you'd come home off the road  And she'd complain  Did you ever just want to grab her  And go  Do you have any idea  How many girls I could have fucked  And didn't  Who said that  Me  Jim Norton  The comedian  That's exactly right  You definitely felt like that  For sure  Wow yeah  Definitely felt like that  I could be banging all these hot chicks  And I'm being faithful  And you're giving me shit  About cutting the grass  You could have opened the front door  And showed her  The girls that he could be banging 
[01:30:30]  The ones that just followed him home  Please  You know man  Just to keep things sane  And normal  I tried to keep her out of the business  As much as possible  Yeah  Yeah  Well that's so you can look at  The hot pieces of the asses  That were walking around  Once you stay home baby  You know how that goes  I don't care if it's a girlfriend  Or a wife man  You know  You just don't look as much  When they're walking right next to you  Oh baby  The hotels  The buses  I don't want to put you through that  Yeah  The signing of the boobs  After the show  Yeah  There's nothing in it for you 
[01:31:00]  Oh man  You guys are killing me right now  I don't have a private P.O. box  Where they send the naked pictures  Oh that's great man  What a life  That's something  Now you're branching out  Got a solo thing happening  What kind of music is this?  It's more adult contemporary stuff  But it's a lot of harmony based stuff  It's sort of like 98 degrees  A little bit more mature than that though  Yeah  You got some guys backing you up  I know  I'm just kind of singing everything myself 
[01:31:30]  Wrote and produced it all myself  What do you do live?  How do you do for the backups?  Well you know  I haven't toured for the record yet  I've basically just been on this Christmas tour  Which is just Christmas music  And you know holiday music  And stuff like that  A couple of my songs  Once in a while  But I haven't toured for the record yet  No lip syncing when you tour right?  No man  I don't lip sync  We didn't lip sync  Isn't that ridiculous?  We just sang acapella  On a national TV show  You think we lip synced on it?  I know  That's dangerous  With no musical cues or anything  You could really screw up  Yeah 
[01:32:00]  That's how we got started  We were pretty decent at that  Hey do you know Ashley at all?  Oh yeah of course  How did you feel  Watching what happened to her  On live television?  As somebody who knows her  You know what  Even if I didn't know her  It's embarrassing  And you know what  The funny thing is  It was such a big deal for her  And they said  She lip synced or whatever  But you know how many people  Lip sync on that show?  Oh I know  Britney's lip syncs on every show  She's ever on  And everybody knows that  Britney's ridiculous  She's dancing like  You know badly  Like a mad woman  She's got that stupid 
[01:32:30]  Headset mic on  And she's dancing around  Singing you know perfectly  And then the song gets done  And she's like  Thank you  She can't even catch her breath  She's swinging her head around  Where no normal human being  Can sing a song  As their neck is twisting around  While you're dancing  You just can't do it  Everybody accepts it  I think they all accept it  You know Janet Jackson  The same thing  Everybody accepts it  They accept that they're entertainers  And not necessarily singers  So they're just kind of like  Okay well we know they're not singing  What kind of dance moves they do 
[01:33:00]  Is she a hop  Yeah well then why not just play a movie  Of them performing  You sit in front of that  Well does Janet Lip sing too?  Who?  Janet L Jackson  I don't know  What do you think?  Dude did you hear what happened to her  At this role?  What happened?  Was he too busy having sex with girls?  Wonderful  All right Jeff  You're all right man  I told you  Thanks  No I told you  We'd all get along  I had to test with you guys  No you were like  You were not feeling it  In the beginning 
[01:33:30]  And I said don't worry  We'll bring this all together  I figured you guys  Would make it all come together for me  I appreciate it  Hey is your CD out now?  Yeah it just came out  It's yours right now  Yeah it's called  Whisper That Way  It's Jeff Timmons  Anything else you want to promote Jeff?  That's it  Yeah I appreciate your time guys  Can you call us back again?  Because we don't really get celebrities on the show ever  I'm sure you don't  Yeah  How do you like XM?  Do you guys like it?  Yeah because you can say fuck  That's the only reason  That's the only reason we're here  No it's great 
[01:34:00]  The freedom to pretty much say what you want  It's awesome  Awesome  Okay cool  Congratulations guys  Thank you Jeff  I appreciate it  Bye take care  There goes Jeff Timmons  Formerly of 98 Degrees  There you go  Nice guy  You got stars coming in all the time now Alice  Yo listen this is Tracy Morgan  I want you to know one thing  When I'm sitting at home  Or in my car  When I got the fly jaguar port on that XM radio  There's nothing better than listening to 
[01:34:30]  The worst of Opie and Anthony  They're awesome  They're Balarious  That's a new word  That's bananas and hilarious mix  They're Balarious  Hey this is Dominic Kinezzi  You know me  I play Uncle Junior on the Sopranos  Right?  Yeah  You're listening to Opie and Anthony  So you think this is funny  The Frankie Blue thing?  I do  I love it  Anytime you can  It's very voyeuristic  Even though it's going out to a bunch of people on the radio 
[01:35:00]  I think this is very voyeuristic  It's an uncomfortable situation  It's somebody put in a position they shouldn't have been in  Well I guess what happened  Our old radio station  WNEW  Yeah  There's a curse with our old station  Ever since we left  Absolutely  Ever since we left  It's just been in the toilet  They can't figure out what to do with the station  And it's just failing miserably  Ratings are always in the toilet  They have tried  How many different formats?  They've tried three or four since we left 
[01:35:30]  Yep  And the one that did the best  Was the three months that they played Christmas music last year  Right  They started like at Halloween  And played it through New Year  And it did better than any format they put on there  Well our old company  They hired this dope John Sykes  Who was supposed to help the radio division  And the radio division has been a disaster  Ever since he took the helm  And now they're just kind of paying him  And he's like in a little office  And no one bothers him  Because he's under contract  And they're going to fire him real soon  But he had no business 
[01:36:00]  Trying to run the radio division of Viacom  Got to bump Joel Hollander up into that position  He's the genius  Joel Hollander is an amazing radio guy  And he will right the ship  But this guy John Sykes  Which is just a waste of space  An asshole  A two-faced fuck  You know he told Anthony and I  When we did the Sex with Sam thing  That crazy haired dick  That we were going to be okay  He said we were going to be okay  And then all of a sudden he just blew us off  Never talked to us again  And then just hid behind lawyers  And his secretary and stuff 
[01:36:30]  Never could get him on the phone again  And we find out how he didn't like the show  Didn't like what we were doing  That's the type of executive you want  Running your radio division  A guy that doesn't have balls  And will tell you to your face  What's going on you know  Oh didn't he think it was bad for kids  The show  Yeah  Yeah  So you know  He thought he knew what he was doing  And we get fired  And the station has been a complete disaster ever since  And the radio division quite frankly  Has been a complete disaster ever since  They lost millions upon millions of dollars  And in the end it was John Sykes' fault 
[01:37:00]  Simple as that  Joel Hollander wasn't running the radio division back then  He just  No he wasn't  And anyway  It's unheard of in radio history  To have a station that has been floundering for as long as any W  It just doesn't happen  When that happens at a station  They fix it  They fix the problem  Right  Especially in New York  Right  It's the number one mark in the country  Right  You can't have a radio property just sitting there  With one rating  And a history like any W has  Yeah  It's in last place 
[01:37:30]  There are radio stations that don't even have a signal  A strong signal in Manhattan that are beating our old station  Easy listening music stations from Long Island beat it out  Right  It's ridiculous  So getting back to the Frankie Blue thing in our old radio station  That has just been in the toilet ever since we left  Falling apart  Because they really thought they knew what they were doing  By firing us and moving on  Oh yeah  They figured they would compete with other stations that are doing very well around New York  Because boy there's a win situation  Go head to head against stations that are just entrenched in the market 
[01:38:00]  Have great ratings doing what they're doing  Because people will just change their habits like that  For the same thing they could get in the place that they've been  For years and years and years  Now RuPaul is what their morning person now  Weren't there was RuPaul  Person that's good  Oh whatever yeah  Morning guy  It's a guy  Morning parental disappointment  When I  It's RuPaul the drag queen does mornings over there  Okay  When I sit there and you have to listen to some people go  RuPaul she is so pretty  It's got a cock 
[01:38:30]  It's a guy  Boy you're a buzz kill  So then  Big smooth back  So then the old company gets a bright idea to hire this Frankie Blue guy  Because he was really good at KTU I guess  What was KTU kind of like a dance mix station  Yeah kind of like commercial dance music  Like dance music  So they're like well we'll hire the guy that made KTU great  Uh huh  And we'll put him on NEW and he'll have the same success over here 
[01:39:00]  Right  Well so far he hasn't done anything  Except get drunk at Christmas gatherings  Oh  And Earl was there too  Yeah our old pal Earl was here  Earl  Was there I should say  And Earl did not give us his tape  I want to go on the record and tell you  He did not have anything to do with the tape we're about to play  Right  He didn't  Okay  So Frankie Blue was at the Christmas luncheon a couple days ago  A Christmas luncheon?  They did a Christmas luncheon and I guess everyone got completely hammered 
[01:39:30]  I would too if I was working over there  Destroy  As a matter of fact I did many times  Yeah he got destroyed everyone else  And with the ratings that just came out I think he had a few extra shots  Uh huh  Because he's probably thinking oh my god I'm a fraud at this point  Oh boy  So then he goes back to the station and he gets into some kind of argument with the DJ that was supposed to go on the air  Now if he was a little tipsy at the time  Uh I'm thinking it probably wasn't one of those good legitimate arguments where you have a point  I've been in arguments with drunk people  They don't usually make good points during arguments 
[01:40:00]  You ever notice that?  What is that?  Why you gotta wear that fucking shirt?  Oh there's a good uh good argument  Yeah this one will last about 18 hours straight  Yeah  So that's what he does  He goes over there gets in a little tiff  And it's uh the DJ that's supposed to go on the air  She pretty much runs out of the station crying or something  I don't know  I wasn't there  Oh boy  But something happened and she just ran out  So now someone has to do the radio show  So who do they get to do the show? 
[01:40:30]  Well Frankie Blue is uh the boss over there  He decides oh I'd fuck her I'll just do it  He's gonna take the mic  Oh he's not a DJ? He's not on air?  He's the program guy  Oh  He's a legendary quote programmer here in New York  Was he ever on the air?  You'll see how legendary he is in a minute here  And then uh he goes oh fuck I don't need her  I'll just do her shift  And I'll do probably a better job  Now he's doing it for WNEW  During this he's talking about KTU  Which is their arch rival in competition  He's just uh he's using the KTU call letters 
[01:41:00]  He makes a mistake and actually says you know  On 1027 W KTU  KTU  And it's NEW  Yeah that's the station they're trying to beat  Yeah  Oops  Oh they must have been loving this at KTU  I bet they play this and just laugh their balls off  So Ben has been playing this all morning in the office  Just laughing like an idiot  Like Ben  I think it's hilarious  Yeah  Yeah  And Earl's there  You know Earl jumps on the air at some point  Earl was the producer 
[01:41:30]  Board op  Yeah  He's the board op guy  The girl that does the show  Is supposed to do that  And Earl hits the buttons when she goes to commercials  And stuff like that  He operates the board  Yeah  So he had the board op for Frankie  Who's all hammered  Right  And who's his boss  And who's his boss  So Earl  I guess you hear him chime in a couple of times  I guess just out of nervousness  And you know  He must have been sitting there going  Oh my god  This guy's hammered  He can't even talk  He's stammering  He's forgetting words  He hiccups in one word  And it makes the word two words 
[01:42:00]  Yeah  And Earl's just like  You can tell  He's really nervous  And then  You gotta understand too  This is one of those radio stations  Where you talk really quickly  Between the music  Music's the most important thing  If you're talking more than 30 seconds  You're not doing your job  He's talking for about four minutes here  Oh I know  We cut it down  But we'll play about two and a half minutes of this  But he's just babbling about nothing  Saying the wrong call letters  This is the boss of the radio station  That was supposed to put WNEW back on the map  Here you go  In New York radio  The boss 
[01:42:30]  So here  You know what  I gotta be honest  If they got Frankie Blue drunk every day  To do a radio show  Oh yeah  The ratings would go through the roof  I'd listen every day  Absolutely  And I hate that type of music  But that's the type of thing they should do  Just get drunks on the air  Drunk DJs  Drunk DJs  I love this song  This is the fucking boss  I love this song  He's fucking hammered  And don't think for a second  That this is some kind of relaxed  Laid back delivery 
[01:43:00]  Yeah this is not radio from the 70s  When all the DJs were encouraged to talk like this  This guy's hammered  This is the type of station  Where your voice has to be way up there  Like WKTU  Yeah high energy  Don't forget RuPaul at the Mordead  Yeah  High energy  Your next chance to win $2,000  Coming up with RuPaul tomorrow morning  Right here  RuPaul let's get back to the music  Right  That's the new mix  W-N-E-W  That's the delivery you're supposed to have  Right  Andy completely messes up  You're supposed to hit the post  Which is stop talking right when the vocals kick in 
[01:43:30]  Yeah  He goes right over the place  Oh I know  Stomps on it  And he's the boss  I love this song  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw  This is Frankie Blue  Now you know for the last several weeks  We've been giving you a chance to win $50,000 in cash  Holy shit 
[01:44:00]  Wow  That is snotted  Wow  Hey this is Frankie Blue  This was the guy that was supposed to get N.E.W. out of the toilet  He's taking the record off the turntable  You think he's going to use the turntable?  Oh I take pleasure in this  God  That dumb station  They really stink  In the mix 1027 redo  And plus win a Toyota 
[01:44:30]  Scion  And I think that is  Going to happen tomorrow morning  Tomorrow morning at 8am  Ricky  RuPaul  Kim  Will pick a winner  And go to that winner's house  Like publishing clearance  Publishing  Why?  Publishing clearance 
[01:45:00]  Did he try to say like publishers clearing house?  Yeah publishing clearance  Publishing clearance  Oh man  Hey I've been snotted on the air a couple of times  But never  Your station is cursed  The devil  Kim  Will pick a winner  And go to that winner's house  Like publishing clearance  Or whether it's a house  Or it's a job  We're coming to you baby  We're going to find you

[01:46:00]  50 winners of the grand prize  Or is it 50 grand prize winner?  I don't know  Or is it a real drunk guy on the air?  And when you do one of these shows  You know you have to speak perfectly  Oh yeah  I know I speak like an idiot  My grammar stinks  But it doesn't really matter  It's a talk show  You just go with the flow  And if I fuck up  You know someone's going to jump on me  And tell me so  But at these radio stations  Everything has to be just perfect  Right  And you're not supposed to just babble and babble 
[01:46:30]  You've got to get back to the music  Yeah  As far as I'm concerned  You guys never fuck up  Thank you Kenny  Thank you Kenny  Very sweet  Just enjoy your hustler  And let us do the heavy lifting here  Okay  That's funny  That's right  50 grand prize winner  Of the redo contest  Of the winner of the Toyota  Scion  Come on baby  You know you want it  If you have qualified in the past several weeks 
[01:47:00]  We're going to pick the winner tomorrow morning at 8am  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there  Pick the winner  I thought he was really going to go for it  RuPaul's going to dip his fat cock in that  He's going to put some Elmer's glue on the tip of his big fat cock  Because that's a guy  Dip it into the winner and pick out one  You know when we were in the bathroom 
[01:47:30]  I was holding RuPaul's fat cock  This is the boss  I love this  Winner tomorrow morning at 8am  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there  Pick the winner  And we're going to find you  Earl lost the fight right there  It takes all day  It's worth the $50,000 in the car  Alright  We have the armored truck  We've got the party patrol vans  We've got the car  We've got everything 
[01:48:00]  But more important than that  We've got the best music in town  So why don't you give me a call  This is Frankie Blue  For Yvonne Velasquez  And  Telephone number is  If you want to make a request  Is  1-877-MIX-1027  So give me a call  Okay baby  Oh yeah baby  If you're in your car right now  Chances are you're sitting in traffic  Then he goes back on  Oh yeah  Yeah we got one more 
[01:48:30]  This is where he screws up the call letters  Which is just  Probably the biggest radio faux pas  You could ever make  Is screwing up those calls  And especially when you screw them up  By replacing them  With the competitions call letters  Right  He's supposed to  For people all over the country  Say WNEW  Right  But it says KTU  Which is their arch rival  Pick the two stations in your city  That battle it out between each other  And picture one of the jocks  Being drunk  And making the mistake  Of using the other stations call 
[01:49:00]  So here's the boss  At our old station  I'd drink too  If I was the boss  Over at that shithole  Completely hammered  Ratings are in the toilet  He has to go on the air  He thought he could handle it  And this is some more of him  Doing his little show  Mix 1027  The new Mix 1027  This is Frankie Blue  And I am so excited  For tomorrow  Like all the old Foster Brooks 
[01:49:30]  I am so excited for tomorrow  Tomorrow  Tomorrow  Tomorrow  Tomorrow  Tomorrow  A drunken hiccup comes out of him  In mid-word  Nice buzz, man  Wow  That must have been a great Christmas luncheon  Must have been  Luncheon  What time was this going on?  I guess luncheon  He's on the air  At the 7 to 12 shift  At night  So the luncheon  Was probably  You know what  Noon, 1  Noon to 3, 4 maybe  Love the nooners, man  Pounding them during the nooners 
[01:50:00]  Here we go  It's Frankie Blue  And I am so excited  For tomorrow  I got Ricky and Rue  Coming in in the morning  Putting their hand in the big old barrel  And picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo 
[01:50:30]  Oh, there it is  Winner of the KTU Mix 102  Oh, where the hell do I work?  Is he going to start singing Janis Joplin tunes?  Wow  Oh, my God  This doesn't sound like just alcohol, by the way  That's my opinion  Dude, this sounds like you're fired  Yeah  This is a firing offense  Yeah, because this is the guy  This is the boss  This isn't some stupid DJ that has a coke problem 
[01:51:00]  That you're trying to, you know, take care of  What?  She should be fired for walking off the shift  What kind of the boss?  Dude, did you just  He told her to leave?  Oh, he told her to leave?  It just shows you that the old place is still a fucking train wreck  Yeah, it is  It's a dump  Yeah, smart move  Getting rid of Opie and Anthony  The only thing that was happening over there  Even when you were there  It stunk  Except for Ron and Fez  Those guys did okay  Well, us and Ron and Fez  You know, we kept the ship going  Yep  They were making a lot of money off our show and Ron and Fez  They should have backed us  Instead, they got this mess 
[01:51:30]  Two years later  Two and a half years later  They still have nothing  Some of the most entertaining programming I've ever heard out of that station, though  Right here  I would put this guy on the air every day drunk  Every day drunk  I would listen every freaking day  And he's, quote, a legend in New York radio  Wow  A fiery wreck today on our wreck cam  Boy, that's a bad one  That is a bad one today  How embarrassed do you think he is this morning if he's up yet?  Oh, my God  When you wake up sober and you'll hear it 
[01:52:00]  You'll be like, ugh  All hungover  Shaken, feeling a little nauseous  Your head is pounding  And your phone's ringing  Frankie  Yeah, Frankie, pick up  Pick up  Yeah, I heard your  I heard your air joke last night  What, are you stupid?  You fucking drunk?  Get a call from Infinity yet?  You will  Yeah, you will  Take a couple of aspirin  And get your ass out of bed  Because I'm sure you'll be in a meeting today 
[01:52:30]  Can you say fired?  Fired  Yeah, call up Hoppy and Anthony  They'll give you some pointers on what to do during your time off  You idiot  And it's not like nobody's heard this clip  This clip just hasn't been circulating through the radio circles all morning  You know, it's like  Dude, I emailed it to everybody this morning  Frankie, it's your mom  Hi  How you doing?  Dr. Phil said when you give something up to replace it with something else  So, I was good to see you giving up the N.E.W. call letters 
[01:53:00]  And replacing it with the KTU call letters  You stupid fuck  I'm your mother so I can say that  Come on over, we'll do shots  I love you  Oh, isn't that great?  There's just a little more here  I gotta hear the KTU thing again  I hear there's a third clip  No, no, this is it  No, this is the  Rumor has it there's a third clip  Well, I think this  At this point is when he was removed  After this break  He was removed from the station  Who removed him?  The general manager  Oh, that is not good 
[01:53:30]  The GM came in and took him off the air?  He's the Mac Daddy  At every radio station  Doesn't go much higher than the GM  Who finished the shift?  I would assume they probably just played music  Probably just played music  And Earl pushed the button  That's good  When your big boss has to come into the studio  And you're supposed to be in charge of all your DJs  And tell you to get the fuck off  Get off  You had it  You are so fired  Go home  Fired  Come out like the manager going to the mound  Just get out  Get out  Do you got the KTU line in there again?  Did you rewind it a little?  I gotta hear him screw up on the calls again 
[01:54:00]  Yeah  He's supposed to say WNEW once again  Is winner  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo Contest  And also you win a Toyota Scion  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull  They're going to put their hand in the barrel  They're going to pick out a winner  And then they're going to fight that winner  And that winner will be rewarded with everything 
[01:54:30]  Mix 102.7  He's stepping all over  He's supposed to be done by the time those lyrics kick in  That is like the most important thing in that type of radio  That type of radio?  Man, you gotta hit the post  Yeah, it's called hit the post  Right, exactly  What did he say?  We're going to fuck the winner?  That sounded like it  Oh, is that where they thought he cursed?  Yeah  I didn't even notice that until we just listened to it  Toyota Scion  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull  They're going to put their hand in the barrel 
[01:55:00]  They're going to pick out a winner  And then they're going to fight that winner  Fight?  What?  What was that?  I think he said fuck  They're going to fuck that winner  I think he was going to say fuck  And was able to stop just in time  Fuck that winner  Wait, that's not a word  Hand in the barrel  They're going to pick out a winner  And then they're going to fuck that winner 
[01:55:30]  And that winner will be rewarded with everything  Mix 1027, Frankie Blue  What's happening?  Tries to have the cool little thing like he's out  Like, yeah, I meant to step all over the vocals  Frankie Blue, what's happening, baby?  All I know is the FCC should hear about that  Oh  And they're going to fuck that winner  At least you guys never said that  Fuck  Right in the asshole  Frankie Blue, baby

[01:56:30]  On WDRUNK  Well, this story is developing  But I do believe he's  Fired  Fired  How long has he been there?  Not too long, man  He was supposed to be the big hire  That was going to turn around that  Crap hole  That was it  He was going to be the guy  At the turnpike, that big fire  Jersey turnpike  You know what that's got to be doing to traffic  Oh, boy  Oh, boy  We have audio  Bridgefield  General manager coming in

Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun  I think we got like a couple more things to get to  Before the eggnog drinking contest for the MiFi

[01:58:30]  Ben, good call, by the way  I wasn't sure if we should go with it  I love it  I wasn't sure if it was that good  But it is hilarious  This is the Opie and Anthony show here  At Sirius Satellite Radio  That's right, baby  Earl, you missed Bernie Getz  Why did you come in for Bernie Getz?  Yeah, Earl  You should have come in for Bernie Getz  I'm sorry, guys  Wouldn't that be great?  Having Bernie in here with a black gentleman? 
[01:59:00]  All I wanted was to get a photo with Earl and Bernie  I thought that would be hilarious  But then people in Earl's community probably would have been very upset with you  You could have staged something where, you know, he's handing you five bucks and you're laughing about it  You know?  Or you have your hand out like you want it  And he's reaching into his pants, grabbing the gun  Sure  Holding a screwdriver  And then he hears your Black Rock Coalition idea and shoots himself  Earl, how are you? 
[01:59:30]  Can't hang with a comedian, I'm not going to even try  Where's your headphone, Earl?  All right, no big deal  How is it over there at NEW?  Quiet  Hey, thanks for that tape, by the way  I did not, I swear, as Christ is my witness, I have nothing to do with it  With what, the Frankie Blue tape that you handed me personally?  No, I  In the middle of the night when no one was looking?  You're an awful human being, you know  Earl had nothing to do with the Frankie Blue tape 
[02:00:00]  Of course not  Aside from the fact that you ran the board, right?  Anthony, why are you winking as you say that?  I know  What were you thinking as that was happening?  It was over  That's all I was thinking  Why didn't you say to him?  Did you say something like during commercials or something  And say, hey, you know  Maybe you're a little too intoxicated to be on the air?  I have no response to that  I have no comment  No comment  He's so shy  He is a typical Viacom employee  What are you going to do?  Cut your two out?  Do you like Dana McClintock? 
[02:00:30]  Bland douche  Anything, Earl?  Can you contribute anything to this program by telling us what was going on?  Absolutely nothing  I got nothing  You don't want to talk about  No  The drunk  Was he indeed drunk?  No comment  I have more info from Bernie Getz  And he shot four guys  Had he been drinking at the Christmas party?  Were you at the Christmas party?  There was a party earlier  Oh  And was he drinking at that party?  I don't know  Quite honestly  You don't know 
[02:01:00]  I honestly don't know  No  No  I think he was popping something  What was the argument about  My personal opinion anyway  Between him and the  That I don't know  I swear to God  Did she walk out crying?  I don't know that either  What do you mean you'll tell us off air?  No  I'm being honest  I don't know anything  I'm telling you  I isolate that  I'm being honest  I don't know anything  Nothing  No  Don't know what the argument is about  I have no idea what happened  Okay  You were in there  You were working the board  Who finally took him off the air? 
[02:01:30]  I think he actually pulled himself  Now stop  You're not being honest  No  I am being honest  Why did he pull himself?  One minute he was there  One minute he was gone  And that's all I know  No one came in  During that time?  No  Not what we heard  Did you ask Bernie for five dollars?  No  No  Why didn't you come in and meet Bernie Gantz?  Do you have a personal problem with Bernie?  No  Because he's not a black guy?  No  I don't  Honestly  Four potential audience members of the Black Rock Coalition program 
[02:02:00]  No  Honestly  My feelings on Bernie then were the same as they were  You know what  If they tried to rob him  They got what was coming to him  All right  All right  Earl's taking a stand  I'll say he is  What a controversial stand he's taking  That's right  All right  Don't give us any information  What happened with Frankie  Earl  Another great appearance  Thank you  Earl  Great  I heard Earl treated Opie finally to lunch  Or dinner was it 
[02:02:30]  What was it  Not really  And Earl finally fessed up  What'd you treat him to Earl  I didn't treat anybody  You took off to dinner didn't you  No  When I didn't have money I was telling these guys  So you had to like  I coughed up some  I always  I always offer money  Always  Always  Prostitutes maybe  Always  Yes  I've never seen you offer money  At any of the dinners  It's usually everyone else digging in  Or someone pulling out a credit card 
[02:03:00]  I always put money on the  Ben told me you had a burger and a bunch of sodas one day  And just paid for the burger without the tax or any of the sodas  Oh that's not  I always overpay  No you don't  I always not  You do not  Come on  I'm not  Okay  Goodbye everybody  Goodbye everybody  Oh  Earl  Oh  Earl  Earl  Earl  Come on Earl  Earl  Earl  Earl  He's black and Jewish  Come on Earl  Sammy Davis  I can't believe he walked out  I can 
[02:03:30]  He has a good jawline though  That was a fast appearance for Earl  I'll say  He actually left the studio  Goodbye  He's got his head down and everything  Bye bye  I'm not coming in  Goodbye  Goodbye  They're practicing being cruel and unusual  The Opie and Anthony show  Here's Opie and Anthony  Your mate aren't stinking  Who took their shoes off  It's a little stinky in here  The worst of Opie and Anthony  He's our old friend Triple H  Yeah  It's been a while  And it was very funny 
[02:04:00]  Time to play the game  Time to play the game  Jesus Christ  You're even bigger now  What the fuck  Yeah  Triple H has entered the studio  What's up guys  And what I was trying to say  Before the music kicked in  It was really funny  Because Master Poe was telling you  Where to sit  Right  And I'm like  No one tells Triple H where to sit  You know what's funny about this whole place  Is you walk in here 
[02:04:30]  Right  So this beautiful building  Old school  Beautiful building  You walk in here  You get up  The hallway's real nice  You walk in the door  It's like walking into a Hell's Angels  You know  Militant group up front  But you walk in  The guy's like  Hey how you doing  Hey  You want some hot chocolate  We got a great hot chocolate machine  The mini marshmallows  Cookies  Anything like that  Can I get you something  That's what you get  Yeah  You know I think Master Poe  Is finally starstruck  Really  Yeah I do believe  He was starstruck by Triple H  Definitely  Yeah 
[02:05:00]  He's our security guy  And he's  I don't know  Quadruple black belt  But you guys need security  Like was the FCC  Going to come up here  Well not the FCC  We really don't know why  I know you guys don't have that anymore  They might want to come up here  And just fight you guys now  Or something  We signed with XM Satellite Radio  I'm sure you know what happened  Yeah  Sex and St. Pat's  And all that  And they're not really telling us  Why there's a lot of security  Around here  Yeah  We don't know  We don't know  They got a few threats  They might have gotten some threats  In Washington or something  Because we have bulletproof glass 
[02:05:30]  We have this Master Poe guy  That's in us  He's pretty much a killer  A transit assassin  Panic rooms  You push the button  This opens up  You got to hide in the bag  Yeah we run in and hide  In our armored room  Like a couple of faggots  So we don't know why  But there's a lot of security  Yes  It'd be good radio  You guys squealing  With gunshots going off  Screaming like women  Hey I got to tell you what though  I mean  I was so excited to hear  That you guys were back  Yeah  Doing this man  Because I missed you guys  You guys were awesome  Sitting out two years 
[02:06:00]  Sucked  Yeah I'm sure it did  It was really rough man  It's great for you guys  To be back doing what you do  Because you guys are awesome at it  Before we start though  I go to commercial  And I run to go take a leak  And I see Triple H  And I'm like hey what's up  And I give him a handshake real fast  Dude you gave me the wettest handshake  Is that urine or water?  Yeah I've just been in the bathroom  You guys don't have any paper towels in there  Or toilet paper  No I had the water in my hand  It's cool to shake Triple H's hand  But what was on it?  Yeah I'm sorry  It was just clammy  I was nervous 
[02:06:30]  No it wasn't even  No it wasn't cold  You don't get nervous  You do that all the time  At parties or something  If you walk around with a drink  In your right hand  Yeah  And you go oh yeah  Meet this guy  You give him the cold icy wet hand  Well now I'm embarrassed  That I did that  Because that's one of my pet peeves  You know we do these book signings  And all this stuff  And you meet all these people  And you understand  People are excited  And they're nervous  But they come up  How are you doing?  And they just  The wet rag  Yeah dude  I don't know where that hand's been  But it's  Speaking of the book  There's this bevy of bacteria on it  Yeah 
[02:07:00]  Well I got the  We don't shake hands anymore  Because I got the flu really bad  We go for the fist  Oh that's great  We go for the fist  It's the fist now  So you've given me the flu now  Well no  No you don't have it now do you?  No no no  He had gotten it  I had it for like a month and a half  Because we were doing a promotional tour  And our fans were coming up to us  With the clammy hands  Right  So  Guy all red with fever  And sweating  And shaking your hand  And coughing into it  And then shaking it  You're watching him  Three people back in the line  Digging at his balls  And scratching  And stuff 
[02:07:30]  And then like  Hey how you doing  Nice to meet you  I've seen guys  Wipe their nose  Just before they give you their hand  I'm like dude  Come on  Help us out a little bit  Sneezing or coughing  Yeah  Nice to meet you  Put the hand out  God damn  And in the bathroom  Is the best too  And you're sitting there  You're standing there  Taking a leak  And the guy  Was just pissing next to you  And reaches over  Hey dude  You know  Love the show  Or nice to meet you  Yeah  You just had his dick in his hand  Yeah  A second ago  It's a hand job by proxy  The guy  Even if he didn't have his dick in his hand 
[02:08:00]  Does he really want your hand  That just had your dick  Apparently he does  You know what I mean  Like that's  Yeah  I've never understood that  Still got like cock warmth on his hand  Slapping it into your palm  Hey sorry about the pube there buddy  Yeah  Take that with you  Yeah  You can keep it  Go ahead  Sell it on eBay or something  We notice in your book  There's a lot of pictures  Yeah  Less reading  More pictures  Yeah  You know  That's  I try to help people out  Yeah  Making it easy  You know  It's funny  I did a book signing  The other day  And I was at this  Borders bookstore  And the lady 
[02:08:30]  You know  It's like very  Librarian type  Snobby  Bookstore lady  And she goes  I think it's great  That you've written this book  I'm sure a lot of your fans  Probably have never picked up a book  And this might help  To expand literature  And I'm looking at her like  That is like the most pompous thing  I've ever heard anybody say  Like I'm sure they've never  Picked up a book  You know  It's a nice stereotypical view  I hope you put these  Near the comic book  So people can see them  You know  Could you be more condescending  The pictures are really good 
[02:09:00]  If you're sitting on the crapper  It's great to just  Yeah  There's some flip through there  You know  Why did you start out  With a pop-up book  You idiot  Is pretty much  What you're saying  It's  You know  It's supposed to be  A motivational book  For training  I mean  It talks about my career  But it's training stuff  And you kind of  Got to show the exercises  And all that  So it's got a lot  Of photos in it  Is there any chance  Of anybody  Attaining that type of physique  Dude  I mean  I mean  It's  You know  We have to  We have to think  That at some point  It's a lot of DNA 
[02:09:30]  It's a lot having to do  With DNA  You know what though  I mean  When I started  I was 14 years old  I just did another show  Earlier today  The WB Morning Show  And when I was there  There were these  14 year old kids  And I was thinking  God that was me  You know  Were you skinny  Yeah  I was like 6'1 at 14  I weighed about 145 pounds  Wow  You know  And I walked in the gym  I'm sure that everybody  In the gym looked at me  And went  Get out of here  You know  Were you going to do  Mop the floor with you  You know  But I hung out  I just wasn't going to go away  You know what I mean  I hung out  And those guys ended up  I was kind of like  The gym mascot  I think  You know  They just took me 
[02:10:00]  Under their wing  And pointed me  In the right direction  That's kind of why  I wrote the book  Really  I think I just want to  You know  There's some kid out there  That's thinking about  Going to the gym  And wants to get in shape  But he doesn't know  How to do it  And doesn't have anybody  Telling him  Maybe he picks that up  And gets him going  In the right direction  You know  Getting sand kicked  In his face at the beach  Yeah  That old gag  Yeah  You know  Could bulk up  And kick some ass  Yeah although nowadays  At 14 too  He's probably hot  Because he can't get laid  Or something  You know  So he just wants  To get some action  And thinks like  God I better get to the gym  You know  Jim you were 
[02:10:30]  Going to read his book  Right  Yeah I could certainly use it  Something to take away  The extra 30 pounds  Of my stomach  Jim you might want  To read it twice  I just got slammed  By Big John Stud  That really hurt  Big John Stud  Good callback  That is a good callback  So you got married  We didn't even know  Yeah one year ago  Man we've been out of it  For a while  We're so self-centered  When our lives are on hold  Everything is on hold  You guys just like 
[02:11:00]  Hold up in your houses  And didn't come out  That was pretty much it  Two years of doing nothing  We're like  He's going out with Stephanie  And people are like  No you ass  He married her a year ago  Yeah  We got married  October 25th last year  Congratulations  Thank you very much  It's going well  It's going great  Yeah  It's going real good  And you get the perks  Because it's the boss's daughter  You know what  Everybody thinks  I get the perks  I actually get it worse  Really  You know it's just like  Vince doesn't  Certainly in business  Doesn't want to look like  He's playing favorites  So you know 
[02:11:30]  Now an idea that I would have  Given him that he would have  Gone  That sounds great  Now he goes  Sounds alright  But you know what  I don't want people  To think I'm doing it  Just because it was  You pitched it in front  Of everybody  So let's do something else  Listen up sonny boy  Yeah  Plus now it's like  A family thing  And trust me  He takes stuff out  On the people he's closest to  You know  Oh yeah  Yeah  I've got no complaints  He's a great guy  How are the holidays  You sit there with the McMahons  And how weird is that  You know at first  I just picture the table  Getting turned over  And the turkey 
[02:12:00]  Being thrown at each other  Yeah because I mean  You've been involved  You've been involved  With Vince for a really long time  But now you're sitting  At his table  Yeah  During Thanksgiving  Or Christmas  Or what have you  It's really cool  I get along with him great  Now they're  I mean really now  It's the  I consider them my family  As much as my own family  You know but  And I think Steph  Feels that way of mine  But at first  I would love to have video  Of the first time  I went over their house  For dinner with Steph  You know  It was like  This like 6 foot 4  270 pound guy  That looks like  Leave it to beaver 
[02:12:30]  Sitting at the table  Like  Yes sir Mr. McMahon  You know  Not saying a word  And I think Vince  Was as nervous as I was  You know it was just like  A really awkward situation  That is  We just kept laughing  At each other  You know  Yeah it was just  Really weird  Because in the ring  There have been times  Where you're right  In his face  And pushing him  And throwing him down  It was probably  His worst nightmare  To begin with  Until he got to know you  That his daughter  Was going to bring home  A wrestler  You know if you think about it  It's funny  A lot of people  Have said that to him  But he's  And I think a lot of people 
[02:13:00]  Within our business  I've had other wrestlers  Say like  God I've never let my  Well what if she brought home  George the Animal Steel  Yeah I mean that would probably  Have been a little bit different  Yeah  Especially because of the age  Yeah  He's got a colostomy back then  I don't know either  But you know  At first I think  Everybody thought that  But Vince is so like  He loves the business so much  And he thinks that  Everything is so cool about it  I think as long as  It was the right guy  He wouldn't have cared  What the guy did  You know as long as  It was the right guy  And luckily he and I 
[02:13:30]  Before I even ever met Steph  He and I had a really good  Working relationship  And a lot of respect  For each other  In that sense  We got along really good  So you know  It didn't really make  A big difference  As far as that  Because it was just awkward  For a little bit of time  There you know  Like I said  That first dinner  If you had a camera on it  You could probably sell that  For some good money  Because it was really awkward  No matter how much  You know each other  In business  It's a brand new situation  It's got to be a little awkward  Yeah  But now it's  Now I mean  What are you going to get him  For Christmas? 
[02:14:00]  You know he's like  The ultimate guy  That has everything  But uses nothing  He is the simplest guy  You know like  You know I mean  He just  He just doesn't use anything  He's not technologically advanced  Like I mean  Unless his electric shaver breaks  There's absolutely nothing  To get him  You know  So it's  I mean I don't know  It's like you know  I get him wrist straps  For the gym  Or something like that  Yeah  The only thing  That's the only things he does  He's still a workout animal  That guy  Wrestling and goes to the gym  Yeah I mean  He's going to be 60 years old 
[02:14:30]  This year  I got to tell you  We can't fake it  I haven't watched wrestling  In a while  I mean  And you know  Anthony and I  Were into it for  I know  Like hardcore  I don't know what happened  When we fell off the air  Like I said  Yeah we just kind of  Fell out of everything  Well I know  You guys couldn't pay  A cable bill  Yeah  And then you know  Well they were still paying us  Thank God  But I don't know  Yeah I know  So what is going on in wrestling  Like give us like a  Quick update  Well you know  A lot of people talk about  Our business now  It's a little bit down  Right now  It's always gone through phases 
[02:15:00]  Yeah  And it's not  Throughout its history too  It's not really down a lot  A little bit  But I mean  We lost a lot of guys  For a lot of different reasons  You know  Stone Cold got hurt  He can't wrestle anymore  Rock went to go to Hollywood  Mick Foley was injured  And decided to write books  I mean we lost a lot of guys  All in one  Brock Lesnar  Trying to do the NFL thing  Yeah  With the dumbest move in the world  Yeah  We were talking about that  He won a bonehead of the year award  Yeah  I mean you know what  I guess on one hand  I guess  I can't blame him  If he hated traveling that much 
[02:15:30]  And he didn't enjoy it  Then I guess he should get out  You know  And that was the biggest thing  I think he just hated being on the road  You know  And he wanted to  I don't know why he thought  Playing football  I guess  Because it was  He was just going to play  For his hometown team  I guess  Is what he thought  I'm not going to any away games guys  Yeah  I'm just going to play the home games  That's it  But yeah  So he decided to leave  And this is the craziest thing  But you know  As of right now  That's  I think he's  Made calls to come back  But I don't think  They're too interested in him right now 
[02:16:00]  You know  It's just  It's a hard thing  All these guys sacrifice  And do a lot of things  To put you in a position  You're in  And the company does  And then to just walk away from it  Without giving anything back  That's bullshit  It's a little loyalty issue there  And then when you try to come back  Because other things failed  You're going to have  A little bit of a problem  Vince seems like  The kind of guy  That loyalty is pretty high up on his list  It is  And you know what  I mean eventually  Vince will  I mean he's had guys  Screw him over  Way worse than that  And eventually it comes around  And eventually he probably will  It's because he's a good businessman  And he understands 
[02:16:30]  If it works out  And money wise  It's a good deal  He's going to  It's just the unfortunate thing for Brock  Is he hadn't been around long enough  To make himself a big enough name  That right now  If he came back  It would make a big deal  It really wouldn't  Right  You know so  There's not that much incentive  For Vince to go  You know what  I know you screwed me over  But come on back here  Yeah  So we'll see what happens  So what are you  What's your story these days  With me I just got  Stripped of the world title  And we're  Yeah  You know what  And I've been champ nine times 
[02:17:00]  Now  Nine times  Nine times  So  We're going to have  An elimination chamber match  Which is me against  Chris Benoit  Jericho  Batista  Randy Orton  And Edge  And that's in  Puerto Rico  January 9th  Nice  What's the chamber match entail  It's this  Gigantic  Metal  Structure  That is absolutely  Brutal  We had one  I think  Either a year and a half 
[02:17:30]  Or two years ago  I wrestled  And Rob Van Dam  Actually  Landed on my throat  And I spent  Almost like  36 hours in the hospital  Because my  Trachea  Started to close down  They wouldn't let me leave  They said I was going to  If I went to sleep  I might die  You know  And the whole thing  It was brutal  It's a really  Non-forgiving  Metal structure  And stuff like that  So it's pretty violent  Yeah  So I'm looking forward to that  Was that worse  Than the other injury you had  The whole  The thigh muscle  Have you heard about this 
[02:18:00]  Wow I forgot about that one  You want to explain again  For the new listeners out there  This is the sickest thing  I've ever heard happen to somebody  The leg thing was the worst  I was  Well it was actually  Not the sickest thing  Sid Vicious jumped off  Top rope one time  And his leg broke in half  The bone  But this was actually  Probably worse  From a physical standpoint  But I was in the ring  Wrestling a tag match  With Austin  Against Benoit  And Jericho  Live TV on Raw  I went to hit Jericho  From behind  And when I did  I planted my leg  And my left quad  Completely ripped off the bone 
[02:18:30]  Just rolled up my leg  And we had about  Five minutes left of the match  And I continued to wrestle  With my quad ripped off  When did it stop hurting?  When I had the surgery  When they gave me the good drugs  Yeah it was brutal  I've never seen that one  I flew  It was in San Jose  I mean if you watch it back  It's like  I wrestle the match  The second it's over  I just roll up  In the fetal position  On the floor  And just wait for somebody  To come and get me out of there  It was brutal 
[02:19:00]  And I went straight  To Birmingham, Alabama  This guy Jim Andrews  Dr. Jim Andrews  Who's done everybody  In the sports  From Michael Jordan  To Roger Clemens  On down  Did my surgery  And it was a career  Ending injury  They basically told me  Nobody comes back  From these  But I did  I stayed in Birmingham  For the next nine months  I never went home  I rehabbed  From nine in the morning  Till six at night  Seven days a week  And came back  Damn it  No problems with it  Right after I came back 
[02:19:30]  I came back in January  And that year  Going into Wrestlemania  My knees started to bother me  I went and got an x-ray done  We just happened to be  Going through Birmingham  Went and got an x-ray done  I fractured my kneecap  When they put your quad back on  They drill holes in your kneecap  And they just run sutures through it  Right  That's all that holds your muscle on  And my kneecap had cracked  And then  I couldn't take time off  Because we were going into Wrestlemania  So I just kept taping it up  And wrestled like that  After Wrestlemania  It was really bothering me  I went and got it checked again 
[02:20:00]  And the corner of my kneecap  Just broke off  And it floated over  Into the side  And it's lodged  In a bunch of tendon  And you know  He just said  Well it'll hurt for a while  Until it heals up  But just  We don't want to go in  And cut it out  Because it's in  It's in the scar tissue  That is now my tendon  You know  So he said  We'll just leave it there  Unless it starts cutting through something  We'll just keep an eye on it  And I've been wrestling with it  That way since  Now it's fine  Yeah I know  It's just  I just got this big lump  On the side of my knee  Where my  Like formed a pearl in there  To try to like 
[02:20:30]  Yeah  Round it off a little bit  Eventually I'll have it taken out  And carve an ashtray out of it  Or something  Yeah sure  Why not  Kneecap ashtray  Yeah  God damn  You guys  You know  Over the years  You've gotten so much more intense  With the moves and everything  I think that has a lot to do with the injuries  That you see  And why maybe a few years back  A lot of the guys  Got out of the business  All in one clip like that  Yeah  Because  Like I said  I haven't seen it in a while  But you guys were starting to do some stuff  That was just  I'd watch and go 
[02:21:00]  Now they've completely lost their mind  This is stuff that will kill you  Yeah  We've tried to tone it back some  And get back to the actual storytelling  And wrestling stuff  Right  And we've been pretty successful at that  So it's helped some  But I think that's  You know  The injury rate is so high in our business  Because of that  We kept pushing the envelope  Pushing the envelope  And all that stuff  And you know  Eventually  Something's got to break  Unfortunately  It's your body  You know what I mean  But I mean  When I was down there in Birmingham  I mean  Andrews does  Like I said  Everybody  He does a lot of football players  And stuff  And he would always put wrestlers over 
[02:21:30]  I mean he's done a lot of guys  In our business too  And he would always put us over  As just saying like  I don't know how you guys do what you do  Because he said  You guys come in here  Ten times more beat up  Than anybody from any other sport  But you're never complaining about it  He said  You know  Football players get one tenth that injury  And you know  They want to take a year off  Or whatever  And you know  Our guys don't do that  You know  It's just the way we're  Ingrained in the business  You know  Back out on the road  Traveling more than any other sport  Yeah  How much longer do you think  You're going to do it?  Well with the movie  Out now 
[02:22:00]  We're going to seg into that  Because now you're becoming  A big movie star  Well I wouldn't say big yet  You're getting there bro  You know  I don't want to leave wrestling  And that's what I keep  Just telling everybody  I still want to top my resume  To say wrestler  And I still want to do this  As long as I can  You only get a  Wrestling is what I love  And you only get a brief window  To do what you love doing  You know  But the movie thing  Is picking up  And that's definitely  An interest to me  But I think that  There's a way to do that  And be able to do both  You know  Go for two, three months  Make a film  Come back to wrestling 
[02:22:30]  For six, ten months  Whatever it takes  And then make the next one  That comes along  But it's a great position to be in  Because I've got a gig  That I love  So I can be really selective  About what I do  I don't have to just  Take the next script  That comes along  I can be really selective  About what I do  And The Rock doesn't wrestle  Anymore at all  Right  He really just comes in  You know  A show here or there  If we're in his hometown  Or something  And he wants to get  Some TV coverage  He does his thing  He just comes out  And yeah  You know  Runs his mouth  Or something like that  Smacks somebody around  And leaves  You know  He'll probably  He'll probably be around soon  Wrestlemania's coming up 
[02:23:00]  He'll probably want to do that gig  You know  So he'll start coming around soon  Or something like that  It's funny that  As soon as Wrestlemania comes  All the guys come out  Of the woodworks  Oh hey  How you been  You know  That's the big show  Yeah  Mike  On Long Island  What's up  Hey what's up guys  Talking to Triple H  Yes I know  Triple H  Big huge fan  Been a fan of you  For a long time  Just a mire of your work  Thanks man  Sorry to see that  You lost the title  Just wanted to tell you  A little bit about the movie  I saw the movie  I thought you were awesome 
[02:23:30]  In it man  Great activity  Thank you  Maybe you can tell  The fans a little bit about it  What was that  Maybe you can tell  The fans a little bit about it  Tell us what it's about  Yeah I haven't seen the movie yet  Yeah it's  Well it's the third  In the Blade series  Love the Blade movies  Yeah they're great  I was a big fan of them too  Which was  I was thrilled when they came with me  To me with this script  You know it was just because  I liked the first two so much  But this one's a bit different  Wesley Snipes is in it  Still hunting the vampires  But there's another group  That's with them  Called the Night Stalkers 
[02:24:00]  Which is Jessica Biel  And Ryan Reynolds  And Parker Posey's also in it  And I play a vampire  And you know we're trying to  End the human race  And Blade and the Night Stalkers  Are trying to save it  And that's the gist of it  I saw a clip  I think it was Ryan Reynolds  That you picked up  And just slam into the ground  And I was like  That could not possibly be him  That is the only  I'll tell you what  He's a tough guy  Yeah  And he's a comedian  And all that stuff  But he gained 20 pounds 
[02:24:30]  For that role  And the only thing he didn't do  Was that one slam  But the rest  Yeah I looked and went  There's no way another human being  That isn't trained for this  Yeah I did it to the stunt guy twice  And he was pretty fucked up  I bet  Yeah  Yeah  But that's the only thing  Ryan didn't do  The rest of the time  I mean I was throwing him  That room was just a concrete room  I must have thrown him  Across that room 20 times  And I would see him at lunch  In his trailer  With ice bags all over him  Laying against the thing  And he'd hobble out  After lunch  He'd hobble back to the set 
[02:25:00]  You know  And I'd be like  Dude you alright  You know  You gained that much weight  For the role  Because I saw him  On one of the movie posters  And I didn't even recognize him  Yeah he trained for like six months  He was  I mean  Really  He was ripped  He looked awesome for the film  You know  And so did Jessica too  They both trained for like  Six months for the film  And they were both pretty jacked up  Did you get to do any sword play?  No  You know I didn't  There was supposed to be a scene  With Wesley Snipes and myself  Where I had a big axe  And he had a sword  That we were supposed to fight with  But they ended up  There's a lot of issues 
[02:25:30]  With Wesley on the set  Oh really?  Yeah  They ended up changing the script a lot  And I ended up doing a lot more stuff  With Ryan because of it  Was he a little  Diva?  About having an axe swung at him?  No  The official statement is that  Wesley was Blade  The entire time  That we were shooting  Gotcha  He was really  So licensed to be an asshole  Yeah  He was  That's what  Blake wants to say  No I'll say  I'll come right out and say  He was really cool  To the six foot four 
[02:26:00]  Two hundred and seventy pound  Wrestle that was looking at him  Really cool  Gotcha  Everybody else  He wasn't so cool  You know a lot of people  Had problems with him  The director had problems  A lot of people  You know that he didn't  Get along with on set  He was fine to me  He was great with me  I had no problems with him at all  Yeah he's not going to  Screw with you  That's for sure  Who the hell's going to  Screw with Triple H?  Yeah I think he just  Didn't know  You know he's  One too sure of the situation  So better be safe than sorry  You know  So everybody has to  Kind of refer to him  As Blade on the set  He's like one of those  Method things  Some guys do that 
[02:26:30]  Yeah no you know  What it was  Most of the time  That I saw him  Everybody was so hot at him  Nobody referred to him at all  Really?  Yeah he really didn't  Talk to people much  And I mean there was  One  I mean there was a lot  Of situations  But and the things  Where people just  Wanted to talk to him  And he just said  Save your breath  I mean you know  What an ass  Yeah it was  It was kind of stiff  You know  And but like I said  He was cool with me  He and I got along fine  But there's a lot  Of other people  That I think you'll  Hear a lot about it  I think they just  And a lot of people 
[02:27:00]  Didn't want to say  Too much about it  Until the movie came out  But now people  Will talk a little  More freely about it  Is that like your  First real big movie?  That's my first movie  Yeah I did a lot  I've done a lot of TV stuff  But that's my first  My first movie rolling  That's cool  Other offers coming in?  Yeah right now  Especially with the movie  Coming out  It did real well this week  It was a number two  But it was a number one  Action film for the week  And it did real well  So there  You know  A lot of things  Are coming in now  A lot of scripts  A lot of people calling  You wrestlers  Can make that transition  You know  The Rock obviously 
[02:27:30]  Is found his audience  And niche  I think Roddy Piper  Was great in them  Yeah  Remember that one?  They Live  Oh They Live  They Live  Yeah that was good  Right right  Very good  Yeah with the glasses  That was great  I'm kind of looking  For my suburban commando  Or Mr. Nanny vehicle  Right  Wow  That's funny  That is really funny  I'm looking for the next hot thing  That goes direct to video  Where no one buys it  And says  Okay he's rotten  I'm just gonna hang the scripts  On the wall 
[02:28:00]  And throw a dart at him dude  Yeah  Yeah  I'm looking for the next thing  That's terrible  So you're being careful  Anybody can do a good one  You know what I mean  Right  It's like the chicks  Anybody can do a hot broad  There you go  Yeah  It's the real lemon  The real bad  Real piece of shit  That's hard to wrap yourself around  When you can stink the nation up  And the theaters worldwide  Hey now you've accomplished something  My friend  Hey what is up with Hulk Hogan these days?  What's the latest on him?  You know he's not wrestling anymore  What I heard  He's just kind of 
[02:28:30]  Being the  What would they call that?  The pageant mom  And running his daughter around  His daughter's hot  She's really hot  It's unbelievable  She's like 14  I know  That's the scary part about it  You see the pictures  It's a little weird  You see the pictures  You think she's like 18, 19, maybe 20  She's like 35 and been divorced twice  Yeah  Then it says under the picture  No she's 14 years old  But she's like 6 foot or something already  I'd have her chained to the house  With a shotgun next to her  Yeah right  With her string tied on it  If somebody moved her  And shot their head off  You know  Yeah I mean yeah 
[02:29:00]  I think he's just kind of  Promoting her  And she's got an album out or something  And I know like I'll see  Every now and then  That she's like singing  The national anthem  At some sports game  Or something like that  So I think he's just kind of  Doing the promotion biz  Let's say hi to Shane  Shane what's up?  Hey guys  How you doing this morning?  Good man  Hey man  Hey Triple H  Yeah  Question for you  Are you going to add  The new X-Pac in China  Pour into your DVD collection?  I might do  It's the size of a little Connor arm 
[02:29:30]  I'll tell you how brave we are  Triple H  I know what he wanted to talk about  I didn't want to mention it to you live  We were talking about the China video yesterday  By the way  Have you seen it?  No  No we saw stills from it  We got the stills  And I don't know  I mean  We've had China on the show  A bunch of times  She's a really really cool person  And I just feel  Kind of sorry for her in a way  You know what  It's  We're talking about  China made a porn tape with her  They don't go out anymore right?  X-Pac  What day is it? 
[02:30:00]  Because I don't know  You used to be friends with X-Pac  I still am  They both have some demons in their lives  You know what I mean  And I've  They've been off and on  But he's still a friend of mine  He called me six months ago or so  And I tried to help him out  Try to get him some help  And get him going in the right direction  And whether that works out or not  I don't know  And whether they're back together or not  I don't know  I talk to him now and then  And it's one of those off and on things  And I don't really know much about it 
[02:30:30]  But unfortunately  It's one of those things where  You know  It's somebody that was  Could have had the world  And just let it all fall away  And now is really  You know  I hate to throw stones  Because I don't know everything about their lives  But really just scraping the bottom of the barrel  And it's sad  Yeah  Yeah I know  That's what we were saying  Sad as a person  I don't  You know  I mean  Just I don't  I don't have anything to do with it anymore  But it's just sad to see anybody  I don't know  Even if I didn't know them at all  I was going to say  To fall that far  Knowing where she was  And then you're looking at this  We were looking at this yesterday  It's like  Wow man  Yeah 
[02:31:00]  What is going on in her head  He was actually  He was actually really pissed about it at first  When the rumor first came out  That she was going to do this  It was one right in the middle  So no one stole the tape  They did this on their own  You think  I believe  As far as I know  She sold it to the people  That did the Paris Hilton video  Yeah  Exactly  One night in China  Yeah  And he was actually really pissed about it at first  And then in true guy fashion  He said  He said  Well I know the tape she's talking about  Well  At least my hose looks big  That's all guys care about it  That's what he cared about 
[02:31:30]  If it's going out nationwide  As long as it was a good angle  Right  I'm okay with it  As long as I wasn't filmed after getting out of the ocean  It's fine  It was a warm day  I had a good fluff going on  You know  What was the situation with China leaving WWE  Because I think there was actually some people talking to blame  Put on like you  Yeah  Well you know that's the thing  She and I were apart  And then I started seeing Steph  And that was an issue  But prior to 
[02:32:00]  Which was a huge upgrade by the way  Yeah  We love Steph  Yeah  She's the best  She actually is  And I love her to death  But  You know  She just  It's one of those things  That sometimes  The more success people get  And it just starts to become  All about them  And you know  She got more and more miserable  And more and more bitter  I used to say that to her all the time  When I met you  You were selling beepers  And you were  The happiest person I knew  Now you've got everything you ever wanted  And you're miserable  24-7  You know 
[02:32:30]  And it just  She was at a time  She was negotiating with Vince  And she just wanted  So much stuff  I mean I know the things  That she wanted  And see she had the benefit  Of knowing  What I had  In my deal  You know  There was only a couple of guys  That had certain deals  In the company  And that's  She wanted that deal  But only better  And you must have been on fire  You were on fire  At the time  Yeah  I mean I was  You know  It was me rocking Austin  You know  I mean that was the deal  And you know 
[02:33:00]  They just said to her  That's absolutely ridiculous  You know  She blew her own deal with Vince  And she can spin it  Any way she wants  And try to blame it  On anything she wants  She blew her own deal with Vince  They were  They were  More than willing to  Give her a hell of a contract  Let her just work TVs  And push her in Hollywood  More than willing to do that  And she just  She just let the whole thing go away  And I think  Really  I think what she thought is  I don't need you  You know what I mean  I actually  I don't need you  She thought at the time 
[02:33:30]  You know  That she had had some talks  With some people  I believe  About Terminator  Three at the time  And about Wonder Woman  And all this stuff  And she blew all that  And I mean  It's just  It's just  A downward spiral  And now  You know  Obviously  If you're putting out  A porno video  A home porno video  Of yourself  Not to knock anybody  That does that  But if  If you've been to those heights  And then that's  Now you're putting out  A home porn movie  To make some cash  On the side  That's exactly why  We were sad  You have to get 
[02:34:00]  A little reflection  And what's going on  With her clit  Jesus  Dude I don't know  No I'm dead serious  Jim thinks it's  The hottest thing ever  Hottest thing ever  I like that  It's a little too big  It looks like  I don't know  It looks lovely  It's like a thumb  It's like a  Christ  There's something going on  There  It makes me a little nervous  But you know  Jim loves it  He thinks it's the best  When they're nice  And puffy  And big  Like that  We all have our thing  That's my thing  Hey you gotta have your thing  You know what I mean  You could be into  Some weirder stuff than that  I'm amazed 
[02:34:30]  I'm amazed  How many people  Leave wrestling  Think they're gonna be  Just absolutely huge  Without Vince  And then it just  Never happens  It's unbelievable  Over and over again  It's unbelievable  And you know what  The weird thing is  And I don't mean to  Say this in like  A knocking fashion  But it's  It happens to the women  More  It happens to the guys  I've seen it happen  To more women  What's her name  I forgot her name  Sable  Thank you  Sonny  Sable  Chyna  I mean  They think they're  Bigger than the wrestling  Yeah they get to  A certain point  And it's like 
[02:35:00]  The fall off the cliff  Point is Playboy  Right  Alright  It's like they get  The offer  Or they do Playboy  And then like  The next day  They're like  And you're gonna do  What for me  Yeah  Screw you  You know how many  Offers I've had  Last night  Over the phone  You know  And it's like  The second  They don't even get it  Because the second  They get off the TV  The phone stops ringing  Right  You know  Oh wait  Vince is not behind you  With the promotional vehicle  Anymore  You're not getting seen  By 20 million people  A week anymore  I'm sorry  Who are you again  Yeah that's why  The people are calling you  In the first place  Is because of the forum 
[02:35:30]  You have in front of  That many people  Yeah  On the wrestling  And also it's pretty much  Your identity  You can't use China  No  Anymore  And no one cares  Who Joanie is  Exactly  And you gotta realize  That's where your fame  Is coming from  She fought Joey  Buttafuco  Oh that's right  That was brutal  Would they take her back  In wrestling now or no?  No  At this point  I'd highly doubt it  I'd highly doubt it  You know  I mean  Up to the point  Of maybe where  Up to this porno point 
[02:36:00]  Yeah right  I think there's a line  You cross there  Where it's just like  Yeah  And it's a little rough  To cross back over  Yeah how can you  Go back to that  You know I mean  So I would highly doubt it  I mean it's kind of  The end of the road  I think there  In a lot of ways  How many of the guys  Own their name  Do you own Triple H?  You don't  No  There's a few guys  That own  Bits and pieces of it  Like you know  Steve Austin  I think owns Steve Austin  But he doesn't own  Stone Cold  Stone Cold  You know  But the thing is  Even if he did  It's not about 
[02:36:30]  Just the name  It's about the promotion  That comes with  And not only that  But the fans  That come with it  And that's what  I don't understand  What people get  It's like when people  Ask me if I'm going  To leave wrestling  To go to Hollywood  You know what  Even if I got hurt  Tomorrow  And couldn't wrestle  Anymore  But I could still  Make movies  I would still stay  In wrestling  In some way  You can't walk away  From what brought you  To the dance  Not to mention  The fact that I love it  Which is why I would stay  For no other reason  Than fans or anything  Like that  I love it  So I would stay  But on the other side 
[02:37:00]  Of that  You can't walk away  From all that  The people that  Brought you there  The fans that got you there  The guy that got you there  Yeah  You know  To me  It's like  When I do the red carpet  Stuff  It's like  I want to put Vince  Over as much as I can  Because it just  The way I see it  If I can go  Make a movie  And there's  You know  A lot of people  That watch the movie  Go this guy's pretty good  He's a wrestler  When's that on  Mondays  And they tune in  To watch that  It helps the wrestling  Business  They wash each other's backs  You know what I mean  And it just works out  For everybody  I've never understood 
[02:37:30]  The other way  The Rock seems to have  Really done well  As far as doing that  Keeping a good relationship  With the wrestling  And then going out  And doing his movies  And stuff  But he's not saying  You know  Blowing off wrestling  Totally  And it's kind of  It's a good business move too  You know  He's able to promote  His stuff  In front of a huge audience  Sure  And I think that's  Important for him to do  You know  I think there are  Some fans that  You know  Think Rock  Did like  You know  Because he's never around  And I think there are  Some fans that are  Disappointed that he's left 
[02:38:00]  But they're very excited  When he comes back  And he does come back  Enough where  You know  Fans are still  Feel like  Like you said  He's not just  Turned his back on them  And walked away  And said you know  To hell with you  You know  He's kind of  Kept a foot in the door  And that's cool  You know  It's kind of  I've always felt  It's kind of like  What Arnold did  With bodybuilding  You know  He walked away from it  He didn't compete anymore  But he's always had a foot  In either a gym  Or he's got his own show  Or you know  He talks about bodybuilding  When he goes on  Or he's smoking pot  With Tommy Chong  Yeah  Or something like that 
[02:38:30]  We had Tommy Chong on  He's like  Oh I used to get high  With Arnold all the time  Likes his weed  Yeah he likes his weed  Smoking pot  And pumping iron  Let's go to the phones  Phil in New York  What's up Phil  What's up boys  How you doing  We're talking to Triple H  Triple H  Good job in Blade  You got some acting chops  Thanks man  I appreciate it  Listen I got a little  Question for you  What transpired  Between you and Goldberg  Because didn't you guys  Have a problem for a while  And then he came  And you guys seemed  To work together  Pretty good  Yeah  You know it was really  I think just a misunderstanding  I think Bill 
[02:39:00]  You know he's a good guy  But he's kind of a hothead  I think  And you know  He read some stuff  On the internet  And I don't know  Whether it was stuff  I actually said  Very well could have been  Or not have been  I've never hidden the fact  And I've said it to Bill  That you know  He's not a great wrestler  He's had a hell of an image  And all that stuff  But he wasn't necessarily  A great wrestler  Technically you know  And he read some stuff  Pissed him off  But the stupid thing  That he did was  And this is because  He's a hothead  Is we were at a toy fair  Together in I think 
[02:39:30]  New York City  I was at an autograph booth  Signing  And I actually was with Steph  And I'm at a booth  And I hear somebody yelling  And I knew he was there  You know  But I didn't think  Anything of it  You know he was at  WCW booth  And I heard somebody yelling  And when I looked up  It was Goldberg  Like 20 feet from me  With nobody between us  Just yelling  You know  Swearing at me  And saying  I'll kick your  Fucking ass  And all this stuff  And I'm  At first I thought  He was kidding  Like I thought  It was one of those things  Where he was going to  Say a bunch of stuff  Because there were fans there  And then kind of 
[02:40:00]  Give me the smirk  And walk off  You know  Then I realized  Like City  It's serious  And I started laughing  Which made him madder  Sure  And but you know  The thing was  There was nobody  Between  He made himself  Like an ass  There was nobody  Between us  It was you know  And I laughed at him  And he got more  You know  More agitated  And threw a big fit  And then took off  Through the crowd  He didn't spear you  No  He didn't spear me  And  Yeah  You're going to yell  And scream  There's no one  Between you and him 
[02:40:30]  Yeah  You know  You got to make your move  So when he first came in  Everyone's brave  When there's people  Hold me back  Hold me back man  First day  First day that he came  To the WWE  I was  You know  I didn't know  What to expect  And I saw him  I was in catering  And I saw him walk in  So I got up  And walked across the room  I wanted to just hit  The confrontation  Right in the head  You know  If it was going to happen  And I walked across the room  And as soon as I got to him  He grabbed me  And hugged me  And said  We're going to make  A lot of money together man  And that was kind of  The end of it  You know  He just  Later  He just said 
[02:41:00]  You know  I was just hothead  I made a mistake  And sorry  I said  Well you know what  If you ever have a problem  Just pull the guy aside man  Just pull him aside  Say hey  You got a problem with me  Yeah  Let's hash it out  You know  I mean  That's how you do it  You don't  Have you ever purposely  Hurt anyone in the ring  No  Come on  No  Just gave him a little extra  Because you were pissed  At him backstage  I've beat a guy up  In the ring before  I beat Fan up in the ring  Before too  Some fans up in the ring  Before too  For hitting the ring  But I beat a guy up  I hear that goes on 
[02:41:30]  I mean  You know  You don't get along  With everybody  And there's wrestlers  That you know  When they get in the ring  With some of these guys  They'll give a little extra  A little extra  You know what  It's a situation though  Where in the ring  In what we do  I have to trust the guy  I'm working with  With my body  Because I'm putting myself  In positions where he can cripple me  He has to trust me with his  That's crazy by the way  If I had a problem  With somebody  I'd handle it outside of the ring  And not in the ring  There was just an incident  Not that long ago  Where one of our guys  Got mad at another guy  And punched him in the face  And blacked his eye  And beat him up pretty good  In the ring  And you know  That guy came real close  To getting fired 
[02:42:00]  Vince was so mad  It's just something  We don't tolerate  In our business  Now I've had a guy before  When I was in WCW one time  I just started there  And there was a young guy there  That tried to  I think he thought like  If I make myself look real good  At his expense  Maybe they'll give me a job  And you know  We got in the ring  We were having a match  And all of a sudden  He just tried to take me down  And jump on me  And I just  Rolled him over  Beat the crap out of him  And pinned him you know  And got out of the ring  And when we got to the back  I just you know  Pulled him aside  What the fuck was that  You know  If you want to go  Let's go right here 
[02:42:30]  Or not there  You know  And we hashed it out  But  Alright let's go  To a little extra something  Let's go to Rev in Jersey  Rev what's up  What's up boys  Hey  Triple H  Best wrestler of all time  Just gotta say it  Thanks man  I'm completely floored  To be on the phone with you man  Thank you  I got a ton of questions  I want to ask you  But I'll just go with  The first one  What are your thoughts  On wrestling websites  And how they spoil  The storylines  Particularly  They spoiled the  Tough Enough winner  Punch it out Maverick  There he goes 
[02:43:00]  Punch it out  Yeah that's gotta be tough  Now that the internet  Is so popular  Where you know  People go to these  Taped events  And then give all the  Results on the fan sites  And everyone likes to go  To the fan sites  So it's getting  You know  Everything's getting  Ruined for them  It's hard  I have a lot more respect  For the ones that say  Spoiler  Don't go here  If you don't want to know  The internet is a tough thing  And I think it's  In everything we do  I think that  I guarantee the internet  Is part of the reasons  The NBA's beating up fans  Because the fans 
[02:43:30]  Know so much about you  And what they don't know  They make up  And they have their own  Opinions on  And there's so much  Of that out there  And they can really  Are you talking about  Whackbag.com?  We got the fan sites  And the message boards  That think they know  Everything about us  Yeah it's the same  In every business  And everybody knows  Everything about us  And everybody has  Their opinions and stuff  And it's all a joke  It's these people  That don't even have  It's a 12 year old kid  In Podunk  Or some guy that  Wished he was a wrestler  And he's mad  Because he wasn't 
[02:44:00]  Or thinks he has a friend  That knows this guy  That's cousin's brother's uncle  Was in the office one day  I mean it's just ridiculous  And it's a shame  And unfortunately  What we do in our business  There's a lot of  You know it's a lot of  Impact and surprise stuff  Like things that  You're not expecting  And when we do things  It's like now  At arenas  We're having to  Like be careful  Like if we have  Something that we're  Going to do  That we want to be  A surprise  It's like you can't  Nobody can know  We can't tell  The other wrestlers  We can't tell 
[02:44:30]  The crew  You know if  It's like you know  If we want a surprise  And bring Rock out  On the show  It's almost like  We don't want to  Bring him to the building  Until he goes on live  Because as soon as  Somebody sees him  They're on the phone  With their friend  Who calls up  The internet guy  And then it's on  The internet  Rock's going to be  At Raw tonight  Or whatever  You know I mean  It just kills everything  And then as a fan  At home  It just kills the surprise  And it just ruins  It's like knowing  The finish of the film  Like three quarters  The way through it  And the guy next  He goes  I saw this yesterday  Watch this  The guy gets killed  At the end  Right  You know  It's just 
[02:45:00]  It's brutal  Bruce Willis was dead  The whole movie  Yeah I know  That was great  I read that  We have our instant feedback  Over here  And people can just  Email into us  And we read it  On the fly  As it goes by  And one day  Years ago  I'm just sitting there  We're talking about movies  And talking about Sixth Sense  And I look over  And all I see  Printed is  Bruce Willis was dead  The whole movie  I go  Hey thank you  You son of a bitch  You just wrecked that for me  In like one sentence  So then we had to  Say it on the air  Yeah  Of course 
[02:45:30]  Because it was ruined for me  We had to ruin it  Ruined for everybody  Yeah  Misery loves company  Yeah  You ever read anything  On message boards  That like stuck in your head  Or pissed you off  Or something  You know what  At first  Especially when I first  Got with Steph  You know  Because it was like  One of those things  Where you know  I was on top  In the business  And I was chairman  I was all these things  And nobody had a problem  With it  The second anybody  Found out that I was  Involved with Steph  It was all like  I didn't deserve any of it  It was all 
[02:46:00]  You know  Because I'm banging  The boss's daughter  Now I got this  Now did you sit there  And read some of these  And just go  You sons of bitches  Every now  You know what  I would never go on  I don't even know  How to turn a computer on  But every now and then  Somebody would show me  Something or give me  Something you know  Like oh read this  You know  Yeah it would piss me off  What lunatic's going to  Hand you something like that  From a message board  One of the other guys  Trying to piss me off  Yeah  Like oh you might want  To read this  Yeah  And leave it on your  Locker or something  And that  You know 
[02:46:30]  It got to me at first  Now I could care less  I mean there's just  So much of that out there  That I could really  Care less about it  And there's just  Reports on everything  In  Because I have a  Behind the scenes  Relationship with somebody  That's also important  In the business  It's like the  Most talked about thing  And there's always  Somebody with an opinion  Or I did this  Or I  You know  Threatened this guy  That he was going  To get fired  If he didn't do that  Like I have that ability  Or you know  I mean it's just  You know  Pat Patterson 
[02:47:00]  One of our agents  Just left the business  And you know  He's like  Pat's like 60  Something years old  65 years old  He's retired four times  Since I've been with the company  He just  He misses the business  He ends up coming back  He retired again  You know  And decided he wanted  To be out of the business  Well it was like  The big internet thing  Was it was all because of me  Like Pat and I  Didn't get along anymore  And I went to Vince  And said you fire Pat Patterson  And Vince fired him  You know  I mean  It's just ridiculous  You know  Stupid stuff  Yeah  It's just silly  Actually now it makes me laugh  You know  It's just funny  Some of the stuff  They think up on their own 
[02:47:30]  And write down like it's fact  Yeah  I wish we could come up  With that good a storyline  Yeah  You know what I mean  Hey are you allowed to  Spank girls anymore  We used to bring girls in  For you to spank  Yeah  You know  That was a  A big factor  With my wife  Right before I left  Today  Yeah  You know  I was  You gotta remember man  We were huge  With the WWF  Well now WWE  And yes  They all used to listen  All the time  And Triple H  Would come in here  And we would find  The finest pieces of asses 
[02:48:00]  For you to spank  Yeah  It's funny  One of the guys  That was coming in here  With me the day  One of the last times  I was on  Was this guy  Mark Carano  That was a  Publicity guy  For our company  Came with me  On the appearance  That day  I don't know  If you guys remember  I had him spanking the girls  Told the one girl  To make out with him  And all that stuff  To this day  His nickname is Spanky  In the office  Yeah  And I just saw him  Yesterday  I was like  Dude I'm doing  Opie and Anthony  Tomorrow  And he was like  Get out  I'm not going  Oh that's bullshit  You know  He wanted to be here  So bad  You know  So you got the talk  From Stephanie

[02:53:00]  They're from  The Apprentice  A show I gotta admit  I've never seen  It's okay  You're not the first  No it's getting  You know the show  Is doing great  We've never seen it either  So it makes all of us  We're better off  If you don't watch the show  I didn't watch last week  What season is it  Is this the first  Is this the second season  Second season  Second season  And all three have been  Fired  You guys all got food  Almost sixteen people  At this point  Have been fired  How many are left  Almost sixteen  Fifteen and a half  Was Donald nice to you  No  No  Is he a dick  I wouldn't go that far 
[02:53:30]  I met him once  He was really mean to me  I asked for a picture  We don't talk about  Donald's dick  Why  Wow  I kind of like that  Out of the gate  I like that  Naughty  Very naughty  We're not going down  That path Elizabeth  He was very mean to me  When I met him  So I was wondering  If he was mean to you  He's just a caricature  Of himself  He's just like  The most extreme form  Of him  That's what I think  I think everything  Is exaggerated  Okay  And that's what makes  That's what makes great TV  Yeah  He's the biggest  And the best  Yeah  And everything is 
[02:54:00]  In the industry  Biggest and the best  Are we still talking  About his dick  Are you all lawyers  All of you lawyers  No  No  Stacey's a lawyer right  Yes  And what did you guys  Do before The Apprentice  I own my own  Marketing consulting firm  Wow  What did you market  Mostly consumer products  Very good  I spent the last five years  In venture capital  Investing in technology  Oh my god  We got smart girls  That's the only reason  Why I invite these ladies  We're not used to  Having smart girls  In the studio  Usually when we ask  That question  We don't get answers  Like that 
[02:54:30]  No  I've been stripping  For five years  What is venture capital  What is that  We provide capital  For startups  So if an entrepreneur  Has an idea  We sort of evaluate  The idea  See if it's going to be  A big opportunity  And then you know  If it works  You'll invest in it  Give them money  Yeah  Give them money  And didn't you graduate  Like top of your class  In your MBA program  She's pointing to me  Elizabeth  Yeah  Yeah I graduated  Top of my class  Didn't think she was  Talking to Jim Norton  I dropped out  You know  Suicide attempt  In high school 
[02:55:00]  LOL  They think you're kidding  Ouch  You want to see  The scars on his arm  Elizabeth  You got the boot first  Oh no  Stacy did  Why did they kick you off  I know he fires people  That's the big thing  I've never seen the shows  Why did he throw you off  I think he was just  Looking for someone  To take a risk  And I was not  Going to go out there  And just blatantly  Disregard what my  Project manager was doing  I mean my project manager  Was slacking  He wasn't really doing much  And I just kept  Complaining about it  They didn't like that  No but at the end  You were like  I would love the opportunity  To be a PM 
[02:55:30]  Like you were like  I will step up to the plate  Give me the opportunity  To do that  Yeah I did that  But it was too little  Too late  Whatever I got to go  Party for a month afterwards  That sounds like  Our Washington meetings  Yeah  Like corporate talk  I'm not used to listening  PMs and  I'm not used to listening  To smart girls talk  Oh project manager  PM it's the same thing  Sorry sorry  Abbreviation  Can you dumb it down  For us and our listeners  They might be a little  Too smart for our audience  And who was your  Project manager  It was 
[02:56:00]  That time it was Wes  And that's another contestant  Yeah  Yeah  And then he's like  Your boss or something  Basically the way it works  Is that one person  On each team  Is nominated to lead  The task  And they dole out orders  And people are supposed  To follow them  And whether or not  They follow them  It's up to them  Bless you  Don't mind him  A little hepatitis  And basically  If you  The team that wins  Gets a prize  And the team that loses  Goes to the boardroom  And one person's  Fired at the end  Right 
[02:56:30]  Okay so the winning team  Doesn't have to worry  About getting thrown off  Exactly  Like the immunity idol  They all basically  Come on  All basically  Have the same angle going  You know  It's true  It's like Survivor  Or something  Yeah  Yeah the only difference  This season was  Last season they didn't  Have exemption  Which is like immunity  From Survivor  So this season  It was different  Because if you won  Then the project manager  Would have exemption  Which is just immunity  I gotta ask a question too  When you win  You get the job  Right that's basically  You guys are fighting  Now the guy that won 
[02:57:00]  Last year  How much money  Does the job pay  Was it a guy who won  Yeah yeah  We don't know his name  We don't want it  I love it  But it's good that you  Assumed it was a guy  I'll tell you how  No no no no  Hold on there Gloria Allred  I actually  I saw him  On the same day  That Trump blew me off  They said that's the guy  That won last year  So they saw  Pointing it out to me  Backpedal backpedal  No at the Trump roast  I was there  I'm very popular friends  But I wanted to know  What kind of pay  Is it a high paying job  Or is it  What is it  100 grand a year  200 grand a year  250  And for a lot of people 
[02:57:30]  In this group  It's a pay cut  Really  Oh really  Yeah  You guys making a lot of cash  Some people  Nice  Some people  I think the lawyer means her  For her it's a pay cut  No but I mean  There are people  Who have been practicing  For five years  There are people  Who have been out  In the work world  You're a lawyer  Yes I'm an attorney  You're an attorney  You went through everything  And you've practiced law  Yes I'm currently practicing  Currently practicing law  What kind of law  I do corporate work  I work on hedge funds  Hedge funds  Bottom line is  Don't argue with Stacy 
[02:58:00]  I guess not  Don't argue with any  Of these girls actually  I was on the phone  With someone the other day  And they're like  Oh you can't argue  With an apprentice  Can you  That's really the bottom line  So hedge funds  Those are the guys  That kind of  I don't know what they do  But I know they make  I just know hedge fund  People make a lot of money  A lot of money  We know nothing  I know  Hedge fund  You sell bushes  I really am stupid  Uneducated boob I am  And then who got  Kicked off next  Elizabeth  Yeah  That was me  And why did you get  Kicked off  I had a mutiny  On my hands  A mutiny 
[02:58:30]  Yeah  The team decided  To kind of conspire  And not do what  We needed to do  For the task  And since I was  The odd one out  I got fired  Were you the project manager  I was the project manager  Now how did you get that  Huh  How did you get that job  Picked it out of a hat  I think that time  Oh I thought maybe  It was based on skills  Or something  No  No  But it was actually  A marketing task  Which is kind of what I do  So it was a cool task  For me anyway  And was your team  Up for the challenge  Or no  Well you could ask Ivana  She was on my team  Oh Ivana 
[02:59:00]  You were one of the ones  That kicked her off  She was one of the ones  That conspired against me  Well to be fair  Chris Arisa  Who is another contestant  On this show  And I  Were strongly opposed  To doing the coup  But there is  It was split  It was sort of  An interesting episode  Because we had  All these characters  See I don't know this  Because I wasn't there  Obviously  Yeah  They were doing it  We had all  You know we had  All these characters  On our team  And Raj  Who is another character  I'm sorry  Contestant on the show  He's very into 
[02:59:30]  Like the military  And he thinks  He's a general  He thinks he's living  In the 1800s  Like in several war times  And so he's like  Napoleon's his idol  Yeah exactly  And so the guy  Is like  Forget this  We're staging a coup  And he just  You know  Was like  This plan of attack  Came on the whiteboard  You know he erased  Everything that  Elizabeth had written down  And was like  We're doing this  So yeah  It was pretty  Dramatic  But at that point  It didn't really  I mean you know  It's about getting  The next person fired  It was less about  Getting the marketing right 
[03:00:00]  Than it was about  Kind of who to  Is this what your radio show  Would be like  If you had one  Because I heard  You girls want  Like a radio show  Are we right in here  Yeah  No we were talking  We were talking  About different topics  Actually  Really  For the radio show  Like what  Oh I have a question too  I want to ask  One question before  Go ahead Jimmy  Who was the one  That got fired  For saying something  Like anti-semitic  Or whatever  Oh Jen C  Jen C  She'll never work  In New York again  I don't think  Oh  Boom  It's a fact  She needs to move  Was she like a real 
[03:00:30]  Was she a creep  Or was she just  Nice who got misquoted  It depends on who you ask  Well the C  Is from her last name  Jimmy  Define creep  Yeah  Well you guys  Dealt with her right  You were on  You were on the show  With her  Yes  She is a difficult person  What'd she do  Look I feel really bad  That she got fired  From her real job  After the fact  That's unfortunate  It's unfortunate  But you know what  You have to pay attention  To what you say  That's true  The whole world's watching  And if you make  One wrong move  In the wrong direction  You're screwed  You're going to pay for it  You're going to pay for it  That's true  What did she say  She said something like 
[03:01:00]  Cheap Jewish women  Something bad  Basically the task  Was to start up a restaurant  And our first customers  Were these two women  I don't know if they were Jewish  I'm Jewish  I don't know if they were Jewish  There were no identifiable features  I mean  They weren't wearing a big star  It was Friday  It was Shabbat  Okay  Yeah  I mean  You really don't  We don't know  But anyway  She identified them  In her mind as Jewish  And she called these  She said that they were  Cheap Jewish women  Fat  Fat  She said cheap too  Like New York Jewish women  Or something like that  New York Jewish women  Cheap fat New York Jewish women 
[03:01:30]  Mel Gibson should be applauded  Or something really  Yeah  She could go work for him  But to be fair  The episode had blown that statement  Out of proportion  Because it wasn't central  I heard that  To our discussion in the boardroom  Yeah  It seems like editing  Is really handy with reality shows  Like they edit a lot of stuff  To make it look like you said stuff  And had a little more meaning  To what you said  Than you really meant  It never came up in the boardroom  It's true  I mean I never brought it up  The conversation lasted like three minutes 
[03:02:00]  We really didn't understand  What was exactly said  Until they showed it on TV  But then you watch the episode  And it sounds like  We're fighting about it  For like 15 minutes  See  Now are there other instances  Where maybe you said something  And then you watch the episode  And go oh my god  That was like a passing thing  Every episode  I think the one where Maria  Sends me away or whatever  Because I'm useless  Was another one  I don't know  It was the fashion task  And she basically sends me away  Because on the show 
[03:02:30]  It appears that she sends me away  Because I don't know  I'm useless  But in reality  She sent me away  To do interviewing of the buyers  Which is what I do for a living  And it was a really important thing  For the task  And it ended up really helping us win  It's so funny  That a lot of times  People are saying  Well where were you  You weren't even there  You weren't even doing anything  The whole point of the fact of the matter  Was that we were always divided up  Into groups  And we were doing other things  I mean you can't do everything  All together  Right  Now earlier I was asking you  What would you do  If you had a radio show  And you're not talking about  The Apprentice  Because I know that we kind of heard  That you were kind of pitching  Some show idea 
[03:03:00]  My idea  I mean I was thinking about this  And I think that the radio  Needs something fresh and new  Similar to the view  But not quite there  Because I think that we need  Something younger  Something a little more refreshing  Maybe a little sexier  Oh sexier  I like that  Let's hear more  So I picked this idea  Yeah  Well  See look he's so excited  Sexier than the view  No that's not exciting  About Norton's face  I don't know  Because I ordered a shine 
[03:03:30]  That's good  Okay  Alright  What do you mean by sexier?  I mean it's  I think that I'd be more excited  To watch something  Where young women  Are talking about their views  On dating  And on sex  And on everything  I think  Jimmy  Why is he laughing  Saying that?  What's so funny?  You don't like our idea?  No no no no  I think he may be  Lactis intolerant  I just got nervous 
[03:04:00]  What a despicable human being  I'm the one standing next to him  Oh I'm sorry  Oh no  Someone open the door  I just got nervous  What do you think  Those are for?  These girls are so hot  I'm sorry  You effing farted  Did you hear it  And try to be nice? 
[03:04:30]  I did  But there was no way  To avoid that  It was pretty loud  He was trying to be nice  Jimmy's laughing here  And then he  Oh no I just  Alright enough already  Cut it out over there  There's two cans of Lysol  There grab one  I have to apologize  He's literally shitting on our show  He is an awful  He didn't like the topic Stacy  Try another one  I'm sorry 
[03:05:00]  I just  Farting in the workplace  Drink more coffee  I just got nervous  I'm sorry  Yvonne is trying to move  As far away from you as possible  No they're not bad actually  They're not bad  The farts aren't bad?  No no no  Not at all  Disgusting  So anyway  Really busting the whole room  Full of guys on the radio  Stereotype apart  Aren't you Jim?  Sorry  I apologize  Alright so the radio show  Sexier  Yeah  Talking about dating  What else?  What else?  Any like  It's kind of like  Young fresh hip 
[03:05:30]  Like the view  But the cool thing is  We all have  Business backgrounds  So you're getting  Kind of the  Professional women's opinion on it  And different backgrounds  Yeah  And we don't want to make it  Like all about business at all  But it's a different spin  On kind of just the average chick  That you talk to  Just grabbing out of your hat  A subject  What would you like  Discuss?  Well  Kind of could be a little audition  Kind of thing over here  What do you think?  Go for it  Go for it  Well  Well  We've discussed this  Go  Well no 
[03:06:00]  I mean  Well I was going to say  Elizabeth actually was written up  In the Inquirer  But we don't  Oh for what?  For what?  We've got to be  You know  Fresh about it though  I don't want them to ask  All the questions  Before we do it  Do it  Really?  Yeah  Yeah I mean just to  What does that mean  What you just said?  She's saying that they don't want to  I don't want to like  Blow our wad  It'd probably be a different  Whoa  Nice  Glad you asked me to clarify that  It's probably a different audience  To be very honest with you  It's okay 
[03:06:30]  Nobody's even like listening  Go oh they said the exact same thing  You know what I mean  It's cool  It wouldn't blow anything  I think one great topic  For example would be like  Sex on the third date  Is it a major mistake  Or a major move in the right direction  Oh  I agree  It's a waste  If it doesn't happen on the first date  That should be the end of the relationship  Why third date?  I think that's kind of  The unwritten rule of dating  Is it really?  Is it really?  It's like put out or shut up  On the third date  Third date  So first date  Is just kind of  A get to know you  Maybe a kiss at the door  So anyone who wants to call Stacy  Her number is  212-555 
[03:07:00]  What if you go to three different places  On the same night?  Anything?  Does that count?  See Norton wants a girlfriend  But he's not going to wait around  To the  You're not going to wait around  To the third date  Not necessarily true  I feel like somebody a lot  Especially not with that  Flatulence problem  No  I'm going to like that though  Because I think it's open  And cute that I'll do it  I think it's cute  Do you think that's an endearing treat?  It is  It's kind of like a smile or a wink  It shows some vulnerability  And a childlike innocence  Who told you that? 
[03:07:30]  That was such an uncomfortable moment  Oh my god  I knew everyone heard it  I feel like I'm hanging out  With my 22 year old brother  But no  If I like a woman  If I respect her and like her  I don't have to have sex  The first couple days  I'd hang with her  Why not?  Really?  How long will you wait?  It depends on the person  If I really like somebody  I don't need to try to have sex  If I go out with them  Five times without sex  If I get no vibes at all  I'm not going to waste my time  Five times in a month  Or five times  Over how long of a period?  It depends on where they live  I work every night  So it's kind of hard  So it's like 
[03:08:00]  If I go out five times in a month  Or a month and a half  And we don't have sex  If I really like them  That's fine  Okay question  Are you paying all five times?  I've got to get to  Wait how do you know  He pays for it?  We're asking if he pays  Well  I'm assuming to get a girl  To go out with him five times  He's paid at least once or twice  Get a girl to go out with  You have to pay  Probably  Will I pay on all the dates?  It depends on how much money she has  I mean if she's somebody  That doesn't make a lot of money  I know I have more  It's like I don't mind  Why not?  I don't look at her like  Here I bought you a pair  Okay but the question is  Does the money factor  No  No not at all 
[03:08:30]  Influence the sex factor?  Not at all  Well I mean mostly  It does yeah  Most of the time it does  But I mean it's a much more  Direct connection  We avoid the whole dinner  You know  Illusion  He hands her money  At the end of the night  And he hands him sex  Yeah  No I mean  That's the God's honest truth  Jim likes the ladies  Of the evening  Yeah I love him  And spends a lot of money on him  A lot of cash  A lot of cash  In a real relationship like that  No I don't care  I don't look at like  I bought you dinner  Why don't you tell them  What you like girls to do to you  What do you mean?  You were all brave 
[03:09:00]  About farting in front of them  I'll tell anybody anything  You know  Some of these ladies  Come over and what do they do for you?  Just have sex  Regular sex  No no no no  Oh you mean the golden showers?  Well where you have to wait  You like that  Yeah  Wow  Occasionally  Not all the time  No no  It's more than  It's a special treat  Ladies it's more than golden showers  No it's not  Tell them about the log dropping  No there's no log dropping  What are you talking  One slips off  No one's looking  You know  You can't embarrass her  Come on brave man  I'm very brave  I'm just telling you  You have no problem farting  In front of the fine young ladies  Now tell them what you're really into 
[03:09:30]  Tell them how you like  Lay down plastic in your bathtub  I don't lay in the bathtub  In the bathroom  In the bathroom  Because you don't want to mess up your tiles  He lays down plastic  He hires a girl to come over  And sometimes she'll squat over his chest  Okay you're so lying right now  Of course he's lying  No no he's  No I wouldn't lie  No you would lie  And other times  You girls need to leave  Whoa  You girls need to leave the studio  Knowing that that's what he does  Yeah  What  I don't believe you  I swear  And they defecate  I want evidence 
[03:10:00]  I want evidence  I don't believe it  See she's the attorney  No I swear  I need proof  That's his thing  Smell his t-shirt  That's one of his things  It's safe to go over and try it  See what he does  Thanks but no  No I'm a nice guy  It's out of respect  It's not to be a pig  So if you lay down the plastic  If somebody tinkles on you  If a log comes out  What are you going to do  Embarrassing a little  They're horrible  Who's looking  I'm telling you  It's the truth  It's the truth  It's a pack of lies  It's the truth  That's it  Now is that good on a third date  Dropping a log on a guy's chest 
[03:10:30]  Oh look Donald's on TV  Gene Simmons  Good morning  Good morning  Are you for or against log droppings on your chest  Consenting adults  Sounds like the name of a new band  But I like that  This is Gene Simmons from Kiss  We got three girls from The Apprentice in the studio as well Gene  Hi Gene  Hi  Hi ladies  And they're trying to do a radio show  So they're coming in and hang with us a little bit today  Oh god they're in hell aren't they  Ah yeah cause they just found out

I'm 55  Whoa  I'm 55  Whoa  How great is that though  He didn't bullshit or try to hem and haw around  That's why I like this  That's what a rock star is  55 and he'll still have a 20 year old  That's the beauty of Gene Simmons  Still rocking  Yes  Well the way you do it is you add him up  You see  You have two 20 year olds  And then you get a 15 year old  And then it all works out  Oh nice  And then you go to jail  I like that  Not if you're in the right country  I like that  Well you get a 25  That is actually true 
[03:12:30]  That if you go around the world  Or even in different states  It's different ages  It's really fascinating  That must look like something  A little pink nail polish  Chewed off of the tips  Running through his gray chest hair  Oh god I'm really hungry now  Let's get a burger  Love it  Yeah so the girls from The Apprentice  They're going to attempt to do a radio show  I do believe  And why not  Why not is right  They're very very beautiful too  That's the gift of God  Thank you  Do you like the band Kiss Girls

[03:16:00]  Scientifically speaking  The biggest cause of divorce  Is marriage  See how that works out  And the biggest cause of death is life  Well you know why men die younger than their wives  Because they want to  Very nice  The only thing wrong with marriage  One of the two is a man  Yeah  I think unmarried men die earlier than  We don't care  At least we smile 
[03:16:30]  Yeah  I love genes  Yeah  Just what you want to do  Is to wake up in the morning  Or at night  And have somebody  Who never earned the right  Ask you where are you going  And where have you been  The only one who ever had the right  Gave me birth  And my mother stopped torturing me years ago  So that's the one part of marriage  Or one of the parts of marriage  That you hate  Is the fact that you're going to have to  Explain yourself to somebody else  No the only thing wrong with marriage  Is that biologically  It's not a sound idea  Because the male of the species  We're told  Manufactures billions of sperm every day  The female of the species 
[03:17:00]  Only manufactures one egg  Or two eggs per month  Now the only problem is  That ever since we were  Ever since we crawled out of the ooze  We were both created from  You know  At creation  The female of the species  Has actually deluded herself  Into thinking  That all those billions of sperm  Are just for her  Right  So what happens  With gay male couples  Are they just true  Gay doesn't play here  I don't understand that  You know  We're talking about  By the way  Gay men is a different issue  Than gay women 
[03:17:30]  Two beautiful women together  Is just two beautiful women  Yeah why is that  Two ugly women together  That's dykes  No but it is true  That in our society  I mean it's more acceptable  For women together  Than for guys  If you go to the jungles of Africa  And you see two beautiful chicks together  They go  Oh that's pretty  I know  I mean for example  I mean they're passing around  This maxim issue  Of the girls are the apprentice  Yeah  And they're all  You know  In these sort of  Underwear  Yeah poses  And in lingerie  Because the male of the species  Is visually  Stimulated 
[03:18:00]  You know  When we look at  So Dina  Are you saying  You make your sex seem so base  Are you saying  That we're not visually stimulated  You're more  Oh yes  Women no  No I think that's a definition  Guys have given  No that's actually  No  What products sell  Women's products  Typically  How come  Women don't like  Look for guys bulges  Whereas guys  I'm just saying  It's just the way we look at things  No that's because  We've never shown a bulge  You've been seen a bulge  You know how to babysit her  Of course  Hey guys  No no no  Hey guys  The girls will argue  Until they're blue in the face  But if you look at the animal kingdom 
[03:18:30]  The opposite is true  The male is full of colors  And all that  And he's put on a display  Of color and size  For the female  So you're supporting my argument  Gene  There's no reason in the world  Why breasts have to be inflamed like that  That's purely a show of display  That nature provided for the male  Because you can make just as much milk  If the male animal is more beautiful and colorful  Then that means that the female animal  Must be the one that's visually stimulated  That's a nice try  But the animal can be met so  But not for human beings 
[03:19:00]  National Geographic  Welcome to Discovery  But he's right though  It's not knocking women  But men are more likely to be visually stimulated  Than women  More likely  I think you guys are brainwashed  No  I totally disagree  Okay  Women do because they think  It's like a male arrogance  But it's not  It's just  Well let me ask you if this is true  And maybe the ladies can answer  For all women  Because they can speak for all women  Because Opie Anthony and myself  Can speak for all men  Get ready for this one  We're ready for the universal  Okay here's the universal answer 
[03:19:30]  And you can say yes or no  Only yes or no  Yes  Women tend to answer in paragraphs  So guys stop them  If they start talking  I was a child of four  I forgot to clip my toenails  No no  Yes or no  Nothing is ever yes or no  But we'll listen  Well unfortunately  You're on Opie and Anthony's show  And today it's got to be yes or no  See the way they're doing it  It doesn't have to be right away  Gene have you ever been married  No  Can I ask my partner  I was like no  He's got a great story  Here's how it works  Two guys are talking  And two girls are talking  And one guy says to his friend  Listen I've got a blind date for you 
[03:20:00]  So his friend says  What does she look like  Okay now two girls are talking  I've got a blind date for you  So her friend says  What do they do  Okay but you know  That's only because guys are more ugly than women  Starts right away  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  Just say yes or no  But he's right  No  If guys were just as gorgeous as women  We would say what does he look like  He's right  But we may be  You're out of order  Just yes it's true  Or no it's not  No  You're being all humanitive  It's true  Okay they're lying on your show  No we're sharing our opinion  We disagree 
[03:20:30]  We're let's agree  These girls are career women there Gene  So I would be very interested in what a guy does  Not that their looks aren't  The guy's looks aren't important  But the first thing you're not going to think of is  How big is his dick  You're going to think  What's he do  Is this guy something  Correct  And then it all would come from there  Is he a nice guy  His job has something to do with his station in life  Right  And the more money  And the more position he has in life  The more attractive he is  If he comes into a restaurant  And everybody says  See that guy works for the sanitation department  He's not going to get  Well he's not going to get it as easily 
[03:21:00]  As the guy who comes in  Works on Wall Street  Has three houses  Blah blah blah  I asked where they went to school  I'm sorry  Yeah see Gene  I think  You know there are some women  Where that is true  I mean you're talking to three professional women  That support themselves  So I don't know  It might be a little different with us  You know what  You're  And I say this  Just kidding around by the way  If the ladies in the studio are 12 years old  You've got to wait until their biological clock kicks in  And then we'll see  Okay  Well look at  Here's a perfect example 
[03:21:30]  I wish I didn't have my period yet  Let me tell you  It was much more fun as well  What do you think attracts Donald Trump's  Melania her name is  She's gorgeous  What attracts her  Or Marlon Maples  To Donald  I mean he's not a bad looking guy  But do you think that they  Both of them are really hot women  They could definitely get better looking guys  Well do you think that these women are intelligent  Would you please answer the guy's question  Instead of asking your own  So look  Okay let's isolate  Let's isolate the variable then  If there's someone  Looking like Donald Trump  And then you know 
[03:22:00]  Having the same amount of money as he does  Right  So it's Donald Trump  Yeah  And then there's somebody who you're saying  Is better looking  And has the same amount of money  No that's not what was  No  I'm saying  What attracts them  No no no no no  Okay you're putting in the asterisk  Which is has the same amount of money  I'm not saying that  What I'm saying is  If Donald Trump  Let's use Gene's word  Is a sanitation worker  Does he have Melania  Well just speaking from personal experience  I think what attracts women to Donald Trump  Is that he has a certain charisma  Yeah  He is a charismatic  He has a confidence  And a charisma 
[03:22:30]  It's called nine zeros  He has nine zeros  Oh he's so full of it  In all fairness  The women that he has been dating  Or he's married  Are not necessarily  I mean looking for like  An ultimate intellectual probably  I mean come on  You know it's true  I think you know  Like okay  Donald Trump  You know  Art of the deal  Or whatever  I think he's also  You know  Probably perfected  Art of flirting  Like I think he flirts very well  He does  I mean he flirts  He doesn't flirt well enough  To land Melania  If he's a sanitation worker  Guys  You have to quit  Because it's not a fair playing field 
[03:23:00]  They're not playing honesty here  They're playing  But some of us are different  You know  That's not what the question was  Well you know  So basically Gene  Because you don't agree with us  We're lying  No I'm saying that you actually agree  That there are women out there  Who are different  That's true  But the guys  Are only talking about  Predominantly  What seems to be the case  That's all  We're not talking about  Exceptions of course  Yeah  And Gene  You've never been married right Gene  Or you tried it once in a while  No I've never done it  No I can't  I wasn't sure if you did it 
[03:23:30]  A real long time ago  No he's been  He's got the best relationship ever  I have to say though  The exceptions to the rule  For us  Are those other women  That you're talking about  Because we hang out with women  We're professional  And well educated  Then you have to take a look  At the statistics  Blah blah blah  Of course  But you know what  The best  When you meet women  Who are as bright and charming  As they are  If they don't want to play  The honesty game  Let it go  You will not win  You cannot win  Against these women  Let them win  Yeah Gene's allowed to sleep 
[03:24:00]  With whoever he wants  That's great  Right Gene?  Isn't everyone  Well life should be enjoyed  Every day  Well we were talking about that  But the average guy  Can't live the lifestyle  Of Gene Simmons  Like the guy  That's not true  The guy that's selling  Like cars  It's not true  He can always go next door  And borrow a cup of sugar  Yeah that's true  Yeah  But you can't tell the girl  You're dating  Like I'm going to get sugar  You know what I mean?  You can't  No no  Because she's  Remember she's only making  One or two eggs per month  So she sees life 
[03:24:30]  Through different biological eyes  Than the guy does  Guys are hornier  Right Gene?  Well you know  Imagine the most sensitive  Do you really think that?  Just a second  Honestly?  I think that  Just a second  Imagine the most sensitive  Part of your body  Keeps brushing against  Your pants leg  Every step you take  Of course we're more around  I agree with that  And you know  Their button is hidden  They're going  Why do you guys think  About sex all the time?  Well take your little button  And stick it way out there  And just brush it  Against your skirt 
[03:25:00]  Every step you take  I have to just say  I completely disagree  I know so many women  Who are sex obsessed  A lot of them are  You're right  And thinking about it  A lot more than a lot of guys  But again Gene is saying  As a general rule  And he's right  Well as a general rule  The men talk about it more  But it doesn't get  To do anything  No it's not us  We're just repeating information  That's told to us  Social scientists say  That men think about it  Every eight seconds  Women don't  And why is prostitution  So built like on females  Being prostitutes for men  Or even gay men  Being prostitutes for other men  That's about power  No it's not 
[03:25:30]  I get them  It's about sex  Back in the day  It was about power  I'm talking about  My own experience  It's not about power  The guys had the money  Gene I just love the fact  That Jim's trying to win though  That's the best part of this  It was  But I'm talking about prostitution  Like I've spent a lot of cash  On prostitutes  And I mean  A lot of cash  And I understand  What they're saying  But it's not about power  I don't degrade them  It's not like  I'm going to suck it  And get out  It's not sex  Well to Elizabeth's point  I mean  Rape is about power  But not that  I'm just saying  It originated  When men had money  And women had something to sell 
[03:26:00]  That's how it originated  So it was about power  And men couldn't get the sex  So they figured  Hey  Maybe it's about power for the women  Hey look  Give me your money  And I'll give you what you really want  It's about all of that  It's about all of that  It's kind of washing each other out  Hey Gene  Yeah  Sum up why guys should not get married  The whole divorce thing  And losing your money  I was never espousing that  I'm saying that life should be a choice  And you should actually  Say what you mean  And mean what you say  And if a guy ever takes the oath  I'm at  I actually believe in the Catholic notion  Which is if you ever dare 
[03:26:30]  Take that oath  That says you're going to die  In the arms of the person  You're married  You know  Fifty years from now  In sickness and in health  For you know  For sicker or poorer  Richer  All that stuff  You should be held accountable  But everybody lies  You see  They stand in front of their beloved  And their God  And all that stuff  And they say  I'm going to do this  And statistics tell us  That over fifty percent  Within two years  Split  And I'm going  Wait a second  Both of you took an oath  What happened to that oath  Well we changed our mind  And so  I believe in saying 
[03:27:00]  What you mean  And meaning what you say  And the reason  I can't take that oath  Is because  It's fantasy  And I don't like  Breaking oaths  So I'm not saying  To anyone  Don't get married  I'm just saying  That if you do get married  You should be held accountable  And stay there  In her arms  For seventy years  I support that  You're the same person  Every day  That's beautiful Gene  That's right  That's beautiful  I'm agreeing with Gene Simmons  What's the name of the DVD  By the way  The inspiration 
[03:27:30]  Speaking in tongues  And where can people get it  In stores  Oh alright  In stores everywhere  Sure  I downloaded it  And just burnt it to a disc  And I'm watching it  I'm kidding Gene  Don't send your goon squads  After me  In stores and on the internet  Well they wouldn't beat you  They just want to pay my mom  Some more money  So that she can buy another house  Gene what's the DVD about?  Actually about two years ago  The Australian promoters  Asked me to come down  And just lecture 
[03:28:00]  You know get up there  And tell my life story  And I have peculiar notions  About you know life as we know it  The sort of pure honesty  That doesn't exist  Between the male and the female  Of the species  Because we lie to each other  Every single time  We see each other  You know when guys  By the way  When guys talk with each other  They tell the absolute truth  I'm going to kick you  In the balls  I'm going to do this  I'm going to do that  As soon as you meet a girl  You have such nice hair  What's the sign  No I think that's true  Yeah we have to change  We have to speak two languages  We have to speak truth 
[03:28:30]  To each other  And then we have to speak  Flowerly language  To women  Now women want men  To be in touch  With their feminine side  But guys don't care  If you're in touch  With your masculine side  We just want you  To be girls all the time  So women can be women  With each other  And with men  You can just be feminine  We have to be Jekyll and Hyde  Oh  How about that  Cannot argue that point  No I think that's beautiful  In personal relationships  And maybe that's why  We get so confused in business  Maybe that's true  Well you can't have it both ways  You can't walk into the boardroom 
[03:29:00]  You can't have it both ways  You can't walk into the boardroom  With lifted and separated outfit  With perfume and beautiful lipstick  Right  And expect us  Who are visually stimulated  To not think about the other stuff  Right  Yeah  Wow  Don't wear the makeup  Don't wear the heels  Come in  You know  See but then we can't be  Quote women  That's a different environment  Well you want us to be in touch  With our feminine side  How about a little truck driver  Nod  You know  Be in touch with your masculine side  That's right  And Jean  Follow coming together  What's your whole theory on cash 
[03:29:30]  You were saying in these tapes  Cash is good  Well we all  You know  Because America  Is a remnant of the Puritan ethic  We grow up  You know  Victims of all these  Sort of archaic notions  By the way  And I make no  You know  Sort of  Judgments on any of this  If you want to believe in it  That's fine too  We all grow up learning that  Love is the most powerful force  In the universe  And I wish it were so  You know  I didn't make up these rules  But it's not  Money is the most powerful force 
[03:30:00]  In the universe  And I'll prove it to you  Right  It really is  And it's not a romantic notion  It's just life as we know it  Which is  Because of persecution  Let's say  You can buy sex  Well let's say  Let's say  Well it can buy anything you want  It's the currency of life  Let's say you're a mother  And you have a child  And of course  The first thing you want to do  Is to feed that child  And to nurture it  And so on  No matter how much you say  I love you to the child  The child will perish  Unless you have money  To sustain it  Which is shelter 
[03:30:30]  Food  Clothing  And so on  So before  Before love  You have to have the money  Now it's true that  We all prefer love  It's true that  We wish the world  Were different  But it's actually not true  That love is the most powerful force  Money is the most powerful force  Money is the currency  Money is the expression of love  I know it's a bizarre notion  But it is  Well the truth of the matter is  In this society  You can't do without money  But you can probably do without some love  Although there are people  That would say  Wow  They deserve a radio show 
[03:31:00]  They're actually doing a pretty good job  Can you buy love?  Of course  Well  Men have to  Jim buys love every night  And love  Although I will say though  That money is powerful  But love is what motivates you  To want to go out  And get the money to provide  So maybe you could  I wasn't talking about the motivation  I was just saying  What is  So  Money is really it  And that's okay  And if we get over that notion  Then we get  Okay  Money is the currency of life  My mother needs a hip operation  You know  I need to feed my child 
[03:31:30]  I'm going to get there with love  I wonder if it's money or power  Because what does money really give you  It gives you power  Money is power  Without money you don't have power  Women have  A version of power  But it's very  It's only if men are in the mood  Only if you use the money correctly though  I'm sorry  Well that's another issue  Imagine  Imagine the bus of life pulls up  And the door opens  And you go to the guy  I love you  That bus driver is not letting you on the bus  You'd be surprised if they're hot  I bet you we could finagle our way into the bus  Well women have 
[03:32:00]  You know it's the oldest profession in the world  And it's not prostitution  It's sex  Women have figured out a long time ago  That they can trade  Well you've got some experts here  In terms of using sex to sell  Let me tell you that  Well it's true  You can do that  I'm afraid for doing so  You girls  Did you watch the show  Of course I did  Okay  I think actually we're clear examples of women not using sex  All right  Listen we only got like 40 seconds left in the show  Gene what do you want to plug today  I'm done plugging  But usually it's women
