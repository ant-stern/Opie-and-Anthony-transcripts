<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with technical difficulties, specifically with the hosts' microphones.  After resolving the issue with much humorous complaining about aging equipment and upcoming studio renovations, they transitioned into a discussion about a BBC documentary detailing a woman's sexual relationship with a dolphin in the 1960s, which led to a humorous exploration of online images of dolphin genitalia and other animal sex videos (including chimpanzees and turtles).  This was followed by a segment reviewing clips from a Dave Chappelle interview concerning his departure from *The Chappelle Show*, and a discussion about Hillary Clinton's perceived disconnect from the middle class.  A video dating profile for a woman with a past as a stripper and sex worker was played.  A somewhat awkward "Has-Been Corner" interview with Cindy Williams (Laverne & Shirley) followed, ending abruptly.  The hosts then discussed Gene Wilder's birthday and a DM from Courtney Love promoting her daughter Frances Bean Cobain's band, The Eeries, whose song was subsequently played.  Tweets from Colin Hanks and Bubba Ray Dudley prompted reminiscing about a past limo ride with Dudley.  The segment concluded with a preview of the *Dumb and Dumber To* trailer.

The next segment began with a humorous, fictional movie pitch: "Blueberry Bandit," about a man who steals and redistributes blueberries.  This segued into a detailed discussion of the Manson Family murders documentary, "Six Degrees of Helter Skelter," and the hosts' experiences on the Graveline tour of celebrity death sites in Los Angeles.  A caller, Christine, provided extensive details about the Manson murders, including personal experiences at crime scenes and anniversary events.  She discussed the events, the family members' roles, the aftermath, Susan Atkins' death, and Clem Grogan's parole.  The conversation covered Manson's charisma, manipulation, connections to the Hollywood music scene (especially the Beach Boys), and failed music career attempts.  The hosts and callers discussed Manson's motives, evidence used in the convictions, and the enduring fascination with the case.  Another caller shared a story about his mother's imprisonment with Squeaky Fromm.  The segment shifted to MSNBC's apology spree for airing uncensored offensive language (specifically a Dave Chappelle clip), and a San Marino mayor caught on video throwing dog feces on his neighbor's lawn.  The conversation included a debate on appropriate terminology ("dog shit" vs. "dog feces") and an anti-Redskins advertisement, along with a caller's opinion on the team name. An Xbox One was given away to a caller.

A significant portion of the following segment focused on the Washington Redskins name controversy, with hosts and callers debating its appropriateness and comparing it to the n-word, while criticizing the NFL's inconsistent application of its standards.  The conversation included other team name controversies, such as the renaming of the St. John's Redmen.  A caller identifying as an American Indian stated the name didn't offend her. The discussion expanded to a broader critique of political correctness and perceived hypocrisy within professional sports.  Highly offensive language, including racial slurs, was used frequently.  This segment also featured "The Consumer," E-Rock's food reviews, including Emily's Dark Chocolate Covered Fortune Cookies, Pizza-flavored SpaghettiOs, and Campbell's Chunky Hearty Cheeseburger Soup, with discussion on whether he should heat the food before reviewing.  Further discussion included a Dave Chappelle interview on Letterman, speculating on his reasons for leaving *The Chappelle Show*.  The segment concluded with a humorous discussion about a studio intern, Adrian, accused of smelling badly, involving much joking about his hygiene and the use of Febreze.

The final segment heavily featured speculation regarding Dave Chappelle's departure from *The Chappelle Show*, including theories that he felt he was exploiting his own culture.  A caller, David, echoed this sentiment, referencing similar feelings about shows like *The Boondocks*.  The discussion contrasted Chappelle's success with that of other comedians like Daniel Tosh.  A clip from the Joe Rogan Experience featuring Chappelle's co-creator, Neil Brennan, detailed difficult contract negotiations with Comedy Central, alleging divide-and-conquer tactics and strain on their relationship.  Brennan also stated Chappelle resented teamwork.  The segment included comedic tangents, a caller claiming Freemasons were responsible for Chappelle's departure, recollections of hilarious *Chappelle Show* moments (especially the Rick James skits), and another live review of Cheez-It flavors by E-Rock.  The show concluded with the hosts discussing upcoming tour dates and plugging the post-show call-in segment.

[00:08:00]  jerked off a dolphin i mean they have to say it differently in the paper they have to be careful  they say had sex but it was a jerking off thing that's it uh but things got weird when the frisky  flipper started coming on to the trainer peter liked to be with me he would rub himself on my knee  my foot or my hand and i allowed that i wasn't uncomfortable as long as it wasn't too rough trainer  margaret howe confesses in the bbc documentary the girl who talked to dolphins which airs next week 
[00:08:30]  when his libido became a distraction she took matters into her own hands oh literally howe said  i felt it was easier to relieve him manually she admits in the documentary oh my god  she jacked him off oh and right here and it was let it was more pleasant than orally and anally  both of which i tried it would just become part of what was going on like an itch just get rid of 
[00:09:00]  that scratch and we would be done and move on house i tell girls all the time let's just get rid of the  itch just jerk me off i'll say whatever you want come on i'll talk out my anus it was sexual on his  part it was not sexual on mine she added oh eventually the study ran out of uh funding and  peter was sent to live in a lab in miami without his true love poor bastard how do you think that  worked out i bet he didn't like it and i bet he died very shortly a big rod fucking he was pumping 
[00:09:30]  out on someone's knuckle he said he's to come watching the adam's family who was it with the  fucking ham would come out the head thing oh the thing thing i go the hand idiot he quickly grew  uh withdrawn and after a few weeks committed suicide wow by they they say by refusing to breathe  really they can do that huh i guess uh veterinarian andy williamson chalked it up to a broken heart 
[00:10:00]  as a veterinarian i wondered about poor peter this dolphin was madly in love with her he said  so there you go damn wow bitches that'll get you she was jerking off the dolphin regularly once you  start jacking off a dolphin every day like that that dolphin's gonna fucking get pretty used to it  something else you know it's funny i i um i one time bonded with an angelfish by fingering it  how'd that work out it wouldn't stop bothering me it would just swim around and look adorable 
[00:10:30]  yeah yeah fiddle it yes let's see the documentary or the uh stimulate five angelfish at once  the trailer something else was affecting her work with peter oh peter they have sexual urges  i'm sure peter had plenty of thoughts along those lines peter liked to be with me he would 
[00:11:00]  rub himself on my knee or my foot or my hand or whatever and i allowed that i didn't i wasn't  uncomfortable with that as long as it wasn't too rough peter had caused margaret some minor injuries  on her legs and stuff oh boy pushing like an obsessed suitor in the beginning when he would get  rambunctious and and have this need i would put him on the elevator and say you go play with the  girls for a day but as peter's urges grew more frequent the process of transporting him down to 
[00:11:30]  the two female dolphins to satisfy him proved disruptive  dolphiny music yeah very dolphiny this is the i'm about to jerk him off the best way of focusing  his mind back on the lessons was to relieve his desires herself manually manually it was just  easier to incorporate that and and let it happen my english teacher jacked me off i'd have done better 
[00:12:00]  in class uh peter was right there he knew that i was right there again it was sexual on his part  it was not sexual on mine sensuous perhaps sensuous just become part of what was going on like an  itch just get rid of that little scratch it and we'll be done move on and and that's really all  it was right i was there while the tank looked like egg drop soup 
[00:12:30]  it was great that she wasn't going to be damaged by that but uh as a veterinarian i wondered about  poor peter poor peter dolphin was madly in love with her  margaret and peter's relationship was continuing to deepen  oh my god and that's where they leave it they leave us hanging like fucking like peter yeah exactly  come on jerk me off by the way it's all feminists and women who want to talk about language

[00:14:00]  time you would have to you would have to look at margaret as she's jerking off the uh  she was angry that day my friend because they said that they would transport him to mate with  the other two and then it became an inconvenience how much of an inconvenience is it when you're  like all right look i'll just jerk off the sea mammal yeah it must have been really inconvenient that  must have been a real headache it almost looks like a vagina yeah yeah it's weird it almost looks  like just one of those sloppier vaginas pointy dog dick coming out of it rotten pointy or it kind

[00:19:30]  it's a cheap ticket  mmm  for the garden tonight  no one wants to watch the team lose at home in a sweep  that's the worst  nah  nope  it's not looking good  yeah  i predict a big comeback  do you  yeah  mike richter was a fun guest  and because he was a fun guest  and uh he responded well to all questions  um  he did  he did  he answered  and i got some answers  since he was six  since he was six  he was pucking  how old  when did you start pucking  that was a great question  terrible question 
[00:20:00]  a lot of people  you know  they start pucking at a young age  but i uh  i think they're gonna come back  and win four straight  that's my prediction  oh that's  that's funny  only one team in history  two  he's done that  two  the maple leafs of 1942  i think only one  and the rangers of 2014  no  oh  stop now  kings are too good  kings are  they're definitely the better team  they are pretty goddamn good  they lost three straight games to boston  remember four  the yankees were three nothing  first time uh  and boston came back  and won four straight  are they gonna add 
[00:20:30]  yes they did  they're gonna lose  and it's gonna be brutal  they're gonna get their ass kicked  well  they need a little more luck  on their side  uh  yeah  luck of the draw  yeah  one of those games  could easily be  well  one out of the  yeah  two out of the three  one of those could easily  been theirs but  that uh  that king's score  um  scoring on him  with less than a second left  was really kind of disheartening  what  it was tight  well no  it was uh  the first period  and it would have been 
[00:21:00]  nothing nothing  going into the second  and that  that just turned the momentum  it was  you know  there was like  seven tenths of a second  on the clock  when the puck went in  that happens  so it kind of really  took the old wind  out of the sills  mike rector  was a great guest  mike  he was  good guy  he was alright  I hope he comes back  uh  let's say hi  to mike in jersey  he thinks he's got  a better video  than the dolphin  uh  having sex  with a fish head  oh no  uh  I've seen the video

[00:24:00]  but they're too stupid  to figure that out  just a little too stupid  if you could figure out  wait I could take that frog  and fuck it  yeah  why doesn't that  dumb monkey brain  figure out  wait a minute  yeah put a couple of pieces  of wood together  and fucking  make a man or something  start a fire  why does that only have  18,000 views?  oh there's a million  versions of that  that's a pretty viral video  that's been out there  for many years  yeah  and then I showed  the turtle one  the turtle in the shoe  that one was a classic  one as well  animal kingdom 
[00:24:30]  is just so wacky  I think I like the dolphin  one the best so far  that's just crazy  that's a good one  oh alright  yeah the turtle  fucking  yeah that's not the one  that's making  look at the turtle's  lip mouth opening  the turtle's going like  ugh  ugh  this is pretty regular though  this is a lot of turtle  sex videos on YouTube  oh really?  yeah this is the  this is the one I saw  is he making that noise?  yeah  oh yeah  oh yeah  oh that's cute  a little whimper  that's a turtle coming 
[00:25:00]  god everyone loves to come  every creature loves to come  look see there's a million of them  turtles love humping shoes  making the same sound  especially crocs  oh dumb turtle  he's fucking a croc  there's a lot of holes to choose from  in a croc  all those things are good for anyway  but literally if you want to know  why people are sexting with their iPhones  look what the rest of nature is doing  right  they're fucking dead animal mouths 
[00:25:30]  and shoes  oh my god  I'm watching a turtle blow alone  it's fucking  it really is loving that fucking shoe  I've never seen this  yeah put these up on our facebook page please  that's very cute noises  doesn't he care  did she say he doesn't even care  no  it's a turtle you dummy  exactly 
[00:26:00]  or a tortoise  it might be a tortoise  some people care  he carries his house on his back  living by the same standards as him  he's pushing the shoe forward  with every hump  oh yeah  showing that shoe  yeah  oh what happened  who's the boss  why would you stop the video  when do you want to  yeah  I want to know how  the tortoise climax  I want to get the other cuck tortoise  who licks up the inside of the shoe  oh it's so weird 
[00:26:30]  that is just odd  but you're right  the noises are so weird  everyone loves to come  dude blow it alone  fucking universally rules  yeah  yeah  they sure like it  god  people will do anything  creatures will do anything  yeah  yeah  but like  you really have to put into perspective  that's what we are  genetic  yeah  brothers and sisters do  same thing  that's what perpetuates the species  yeah  that's why we're not going to really figure out anything  anytime soon  you can try all you want out there  PC people 
[00:27:00]  it's a delicate balance  we're not that far removed from that still  it's going to take a little longer  that's why I get everyone on the same page  for the most part  males  you know  libido is very high  and  and women can  can do other things  without perhaps thinking about sex all the time  right  it's a delicate balance  between  fucking to perpetuate the species  and getting shit done  right  you know  so  which one do you like the best  that's what happens  I might have to go with the tortoise  the dolphin one's pretty damn good too 
[00:27:30]  the dolphin one is really odd  yeah  it's the most impressive  yeah  it is pretty impressive  very impressive  that's a little fish  that fish is tiny  getting that thing  that's like a little fleshlight  right  a picture  imagine laying a fleshlight  on your bed  you're laying on your side  and without using your hands  you get the job done  right  very difficult  maybe we have to go  with the dolphin then  all right  we should take a break 
[00:28:00]  we got Dave Chappelle  starting to talk about  what happened to him  back in the day  huh  that's many years ago now  it's like 10 years ago  almost  7 years  7 years  wait is it 2008  2007-ish  7  did he walk away  from the Chappelle show  I thought it was way before that  is this the first time  he's really talking about it  it's the first time  I've heard him talk about it  yeah  really  didn't he do Oprah though  I thought he did Oprah  after that  did he Falka  I think he did it right after 
[00:28:30]  but it wasn't like  there was enough time  to be reflexive about it  and actually  to answer the other question  I don't think he did  Ant  no  no  we got a couple  thanks  we got a couple clips  from Letterman's  his Letterman appearance  Dave Chappelle  also  we got apologies  I love those  got another apology  more groveling  Hillary explaining some things  oh  she had to backpedal a little 
[00:29:00]  huh  oh boy did she  everyone took to Twitter  and was giving her a beating  like what are you talking about  ran with it  basically saying that  she's completely out of touch  and we missed that  we missed the one thing  in those clips yesterday  when she said  mortgages  yes  yeah she did say  more houses  yeah I mean  we you know  we thought she was lying  through her teeth  about being broke  after leaving the White House  but in one of the clips  which shows she's  completely out of touch  she said mortgages  if you're broke 
[00:29:30]  you're not worrying about  mortgages  she's got no  getting mortgages  no concept of  the middle class  the working class  none  no  they're all full of shit  they've worked a day in her life  alright  we got this as we go to break  welcome to Attainable Dating Solutions  video dating for the unwashed  and socially inept  profile TWTO94  Sandy Kane  um 
[00:30:00]  hi um  this is Sandy Kane  the naked cowgirl  in the house folks  um  yeah so I'm still looking  for Mr. Right  because Mr. Wrong  always did me wrong  so um  I'm looking for a man  who has a good job  and who's something  glamorous  and something  has a big dick  of course  and big balls  and really  I'm part lesbian  because I'd like  a man to eat out  when I was a  fucking hooker  baby  I was  I admit it  man things are that bad 
[00:30:30]  as a stripper  people think strippers  make money  it was really bad  so I mean  um  I used to snort cocaine  and um  be a hooker  I could only  be a hooker  if I snorted cocaine  I had once  five Latin guys  in upper Manhattan  I worked at this place  um  to kiddo  fucking mucho  man  and they had  great cocaine  and we fucked  five fucking guys  and it was fun  you know 
[00:31:00]  I did get  a trichomonas  one time  that's what happened  I got trichomonas  from like  so many guys  coming me  I mean  it wasn't a good hooker  I really  just  just would  open my legs  and like  just you know  get the money  because I was so poor  and  and the cum  in my pussy  now  why should a person  date me now  uh  well I think  I'm a pretty good lover  I think  with all the experience  I've had  and I think  that we'd have  a good time 
[00:31:30]  so I wouldn't even  tell a guy  I have a genital wart  if he saw it  he'd like  look at it  and say  uh  why don't you  have that  thing taken off  and I'm going  why bother  and Nick Cannon  was hot  you know  it's just like  white men  black men  give me the green  no but  can I really do it  without getting money  yes  I probably could  but you know  it's hard to have  sex with someone  to take off  your underwear  to show them  your pussy  and your titties  and stuff  it's so intimate  that um  maybe with cocaine

[00:42:00]  have nothing  to say about  it  I mean  it's you know  definitely sounds  like something  yes  sounds like  something from  the past  yeah  a little bit  yes  a little retro  90s  what does he  sound like  a little  Soul Asylum  a little  Turner  in there  a little  Oasis  a little  Oasis  yeah  over emphasizing  some of the  words like  Oasis  yeah  so is that 
[00:42:30]  like I guess  now that we're  2014  a lot of  young bands  the 90s  were their  influence  oh yeah  they came up  yeah  I kind of  like it  to be honest  with you  yeah  he's got  a little  Smashing  Pumpkins  maybe  it's called  the Eerie's  their Twitter  account is  Eerie's  Official  so  like I said  I'm a sucker  Courtney  DMs me  I gotta play  the song  you really want  another DM  don't you  I kind of  liked her  I didn't like 
[00:43:00]  that she was  tweaking her  nipples  but  that's the  best part  of it  I don't know  I don't know  it's a nipple  play  oh my god  I love  nipple play  it just hurts  I go  ow ow ow  something fun  about it  no no  not hard  gentle  I like them  touch like this  I'm just doing  my thumbs  I have to do  that while I'm  getting my dick  sucked  I got very  sensitive nipples  they get hard  very easily  they're hard  right now  look  they're hard  right now  look  what does that  mean  you need to

[00:44:00]  with my best friend  I'll tell you  what I like  about it  this is stuff  like  this does remind  me of stuff  from the 90s  yeah  so it's like  I don't feel  as fucking  old as I really  am  oh  this is like  new music  coming out  yeah  just a tough  genre to be  in  that rock  category  really tough  yeah there's  really none of  that going on  these days  all the 
[00:44:30]  all the white  kids  fucking  abandoned  the rock  genre  for hip-hop  it's all  fucking  you little  fuckers  for DJ  huh  DJ  all the  BPM stuff  and smoking  wave  fuck  yeah  bunch of  traitors  right  there's no rock  genre anymore  you got only  a few bands  there you go  the eerie 
[00:45:00]  school kid  all right  yeah  just because  Courtney loved  DMs me  I'm not like  oh that's  fucking  horse shit  no I don't  think it's  horse shit  I like it  I actually  like it  I definitely  like it  it's a little  I can't do  any of that  front and yo  I like it  a little  journey down  memory lane  sounding  yeah  we'd have  played that  on AAF  oh yeah  I wrote it  back  it's like it  should be  on an  American Pie  soundtrack  oh  how old 
[00:45:30]  is the dude  singing  like how old  is the band  they're like  yeah they're  probably like  early 20s  I would say  maybe mid 20s  tops  isn't it weird  to hear people  that were like  influenced by the  90s already  like this is  that's like  15 years ago  yeah  it's classic rock  for those guys  I guess it's  classic rock  for everybody  but  but for a kid  coming up  that's got to be  really old music  right  yeah  damn  I wrote it  back  I hope  I wasn't  too douchey  oh no  what did  you say  oh no  I wrote  I'll check  it out 
[00:46:00]  oh boy  when you're  coming in  again  that's okay  right  okay  that's good  that's good  and then I  finished with  we loved  having you  that's good  that wasn't  too bad  not too bad  alright  no  she'll never  write back  I know what  this is about  I'm not stupid  she's trying to  get some promo  yeah  I'm sure she  wrote a lot  of people  yeah  but I took  the bait  fuck it  do you know  how much  I would give  probably a year's  salary to also  have a Courtney  Love DM  just to hold up  right now  but I don't  oh that would  be good  that would be  the same one 
[00:46:30]  Jimmy  Jimmy  alright  I was scared  to play it  why  well cause you  never know  when someone's  I mean obviously  she's basically  asking for a favor  and she was so  cool to us  I'm like fuck it  and I played it  for Travis  I'm like you know  what this isn't  too bad man  yeah maybe  we'll bring it  to the show  oh Travis  liked it  yeah I think  he liked it  gay  yeah I don't  give Travis  any credit  for anything  no  other than

[00:49:30]  I knew  everybody  that follows  me would  look and go  what happened  to the rangers  go kings  yeah  alright  oh that's  right I did  get another  I would call  this an  almost celebrity  tweet last  night  Sam was  very excited  about this  and had to  like retweet  it I'd never  even acknowledged  that he tweeted  that's an  asshole move  this is a  big  I was  excited  I did  get another  celebrity  tweet yesterday  they're very  rare so to  get two in  one day  is pretty  good  Bubba Ray  Dudley  tweeted me 
[00:50:00]  tweeted you  yesterday  cause the rat  Sam obviously  told him that  we're on the  fence or I  personally am on  the fence as  far as having  him come in  why would you  tell him  why would you  tell him that  I don't know  what you're  hope he says  he's on the  fence  I don't talk  to Bubba Ray  Dudley I know  what you're  talking about  you don't want  to be a rat  you don't want  to be a rat  in this business  I didn't say  Obie's on the  fence  that's my  exact quote  I'm on the  fence  it's in his  tweet  I told him  just trying to  lock the guys  down on  something  that was my 
[00:50:30]  quote to him  no you said  that I'm on  the fence  you don't think  Bubba Ray  Dudley would  just pull  I'm on the  fence  especially  cause that's  exactly what I  said to you  that I'm on  the fence  I can go  either way  phrase  but he's  gotta stop  at the limo  thing  he keeps  bringing it  up  he's gotta  stop  and it  was part  of his  tweet  celebrity  tweet  from Bubba Ray  Dudley  OP radio  on the fence  huh  remember when  I drove you  home in my  limo and you  puked  don't make me  bust your  doors down  see you next 
[00:51:00]  week  he just  booked himself  yeah  wait a minute  he just  booked himself  he's gotta go  through fake  rolling to do  that  come on  back when he  was a big  star  back when he  was a big  star and we  were doing  okay ourselves  at NEW  he came in  we had a  great interview  and he's a  Long Island  guy and  instead of  taking the  Long Island  railroad he  goes I'll  take you  home in my  limo but  he gave me  the side  seat  the side  seat doesn't  do well  for me  not good  with the  stop and  go going 
[00:51:30]  from the  side to  the side  I hate  limos  unless I'm  in the back  facing forward  and then it's  just a giant  leg room is  all it is  you're in a  car with  giant leg room  you gotta  sleep  that's all  you're doing  I don't like  sitting on the  side because  man my  wow I got  I got really  car sick  but I think  he claims I  puked in his  car I did  not  by the way  that's probably  why your kids  get sick because  they're facing  backwards right  no they're facing  forwards now  don't car seats  face backwards  yeah at first  and then you gotta  turn them around  you gotta do a 
[00:52:00]  little turn around  so no then it  was the service  road along  out railroad  because I was  having someone  pick me up  I'm like alright  just drop me  off here  I'm good  I got out  and just started  hurling on the  side of the road  that's true  damn  and he brings it  up every fucking  time  every time  every fucking  time  every time  and I guess he  booked himself  he booked himself  he'll be here  next week  he will  what day  are you guys  cool with this  yeah book him  on Friday  yeah Friday  yes  why would you  tell him 
[00:52:30]  he's on the  fence  you did tell  him  you absolutely  told him  I'm on the  fence  you should  never repeat  what's said  I didn't say  on the fence  it's when you  and Opie  are having  pillow talk  he has it  on his chest  will he  shit talk  oh yeah  yeah he will  who's he  shit talking  whoever  he might have  some stories  finally  yeah  has he finally  had it  well I mean  he's been  out of IWE  for some time  so he'll be  able to  and he feels  like he'll  never be back  there  bully Ray  that's right  he's one of  those guys  he can't  use his  real name 
[00:53:00]  but we're  just gonna  call him  you know  Bubba  the whole  time  yeah  we're not  calling him  bully Ray  no one  knows him  as bully  Ray  no  we all  know him  as Bubba  Ray  Dudley  and that's  what we're  gonna say  to him  bully Ray  bully Ray  bully Ray  right  sounds so  silly  exactly  Vince makes  so much  money off  these guys  and then  when he  fires them  he takes  their names  that's just  brutal  he's like  Satan  that is  brutal 
[00:53:30]  and Bubba's  is an especially  funny one  because technically  he was using  the name Bubba Ray  Dudley before  he was in  IWE  but then  Vince McMahon  bought the  intellectual properties  of ECW  yeah  and that's where  Bubba started  using his name  so Vince went  you know  he was like  alright well  I'll buy that  ugh  he was like  no I bought it  already  imagine you don't  even know  you just turn around  and you're like  I own your name  that's what  happened  don't use it  don't use your own 
[00:54:00]  god damn name  it's mine now  I'll sue the  shit out of you  fucking Vince  is definitely  Satan  I own your soul  come on  the dumb and  dumber 2  trailer  why do we care  about this today  big movie  is the trailer

[00:59:30]  a dusty  old pussy joke  it'll do  very well  yeah I'm sure  it'll do  just fine  that trailer  didn't seem too douchey  nah  it follows in line  with the  the first movie  not as douchey  as a lot of the stuff  that's come out  since the first one  you know  right  they  well not both of them  just fucking  what's his name  put out some real shit  Jim Carrey  or Jeff  Jim Carrey  I've been working on a movie  are you 
[01:00:00]  yes  what is it  it's a  it's a wild  madcap comedy  madcap  like a good madcap  it's a romp  and it's about a man  who steals blueberries  ah  there's enough  about the blueberries  it's always just  whatever's in front of his face  that's what my movie's about  his new character  blueberry  man  oh yeah  it does  chips new character  not mine  oh right  yeah  oh of course  sorry  it's chips  but the  the movie's about  man's  been stealing blueberries 
[01:00:30]  no one would watch that  yes they would  no  alright  you mark my words  alright  I can't wait  you don't even know the name of it  it is a stand alone fruit  do you want to know the name of the movie  what is it  it's a blueberry bandit  you don't think that's good  no  it steals blueberries from everywhere  gives them to hungry people  I don't know what to say to this  I know  but it was funny  when you went  when you went  when you went  yes  because you just wanted me to hustle it  and move it along  exactly 
[01:01:00]  hustle it  move it along  come on  yeah  well  well that looks good  when does that come out  later this summer  alright  I saw a good documentary last night  you did?  yeah  what the hell was it  it was six degrees of helter skelter  whoa  it came out in like 2008  it's not a new documentary  but it's pretty good  was it out anywhere  or just went to Netflix 
[01:01:30]  went to Netflix  yeah  popped that fucker on there  and really  just creepy  guy goes to  to all the  houses  and places  that  the murders  lived at  Manson  and that ranch  that they lived in  well a lot of the stuff  was knocked down  right  a lot of the houses  were knocked down  yeah  the ranch  it's so odd  you see that mountain  behind the ranch  right  and he's standing there now  and all the 
[01:02:00]  buildings are gone  but you know  mountains don't really change  so you see that  and he's like  I'm standing in the exact location  where the ranch was  the Charlie Manson ranch  the little Charlie Manson  old western ranch  and he takes you  to all the residents  that were involved  that are still there  he'll start this over  it's very creepy  because he does it  in like a  one of those  death tour  kind of ways  like the Graveline tour  remember in LA  oh god yeah  we took the Graveline tour 
[01:02:30]  the Graveline tour  the locals hated that guy  oh yeah  they were beeping  and giving him the finger  and trying to run him  off the road a little bit  because he would  drive around in a hearse  yeah  and show you where  all the people died  all the big celebrities  did he still do it?  I think there's another  version of it  yeah  well this guy started up  his own version of it  at some point  and then decided to  make a documentary  and he kind of treats  the documentary in that way  right  so when he walks up  to a residence  he gives you kind of  the history of the residence  and he talks to the people 
[01:03:00]  that live there now  and talks to the people  that had bought it  right after the murders  so it's a whole  different take on  the Manson murders  because everybody  pretty much knows  what happened  so  you think they got  a good deal  in the house?  you know what  I don't know  you think that was a steal?  they knocked it down  oh yeah  the one main one  they knocked down  built a big thing on it  big estate  Sharon Tate one?  yeah  they probably couldn't  take all the people  coming by it  yeah yeah  that one's gone  they actually changed  the address too  they changed the number 
[01:03:30]  of the lot  and they also  they showed the  LaBianca house  and that poor bastard  that got killed  leaving  like  I guess he was  leaving  the Tate house  right when  they were coming up  the killers came up  if he left like  two minutes earlier  he'd have gotten out  and they just shot him  in the car  poor fuck  I didn't even know  about that  yeah  I didn't even realize  that happened  I knew about  all the other ones  I'm surprised  they did that  because that wouldn't 
[01:04:00]  tip off the people  in the house  I guess not  it was a small caliber gun  and they shot him  by the gate  and then they went  in the house  and did all that  but he also  goes to a coroner  and gives the coroner  all the autopsy reports  on all the dead people  right  and he gives  a very detailed  analysis  of the  of the  records  of how they were killed  and what killed them  and the stab wounds  and everything  it's really  creepy  compelling 
[01:04:30]  good documentary  though  because it's a  different take  on the whole thing  let's see this trailer  yeah there we go  let's keep watching trailers  I love trailer day  forget that Roman Polanski  was married to Tate  when that happened  yeah  and there was a weird  thing about that too  Roman Polanski  was asked  how long  was Abigail Folger  and her  little pal there  staying at the house  because the cops  wanted to know  how long  they had been guests  at the house  and when he was asked 
[01:05:00]  that he goes  well apparently  too long  which is like  it's a little eerie  to say something  like that  aren't you upset  he never really  showed any emotion  on that thing  did he  for that  I don't know  I haven't seen him  interviewed about it  I've heard things  he said about it  which show that he was  pretty devastated  and he still misses her  it's like DiMaggio  and Marilyn  like he just loved her  until the day  maybe he's like that  maybe this is just  the one for him  fucking lunatics man  like she was  Sharon Tate was the last 
[01:05:30]  one that they killed  and she's sitting on the  couch and they got her  kind of tied up  and she's just begging  for the life of her kid  of her unborn baby  just begging  and they're like  no  I have no sympathy  for you bitch  and then they just  fucking start stabbing her  crazy  so has any of them  is Squeaky  from out of jail  or any of them  Squeaky got life  for trying to kill  Ford  Ford  and then I think 
[01:06:00]  one of them  yeah one of them  got out  because they considered  him kind of retarded  Clem  the Clem guy  he wound up  wound up getting paroled  but none of the other ones  had gotten out  at least since that movie  was made  I know one of the  women have been  you know  the perfect  convict  prisoner  for decades  and  she came close  they were talking  about getting her out  but when you look  at what they did  there's just no 
[01:06:30]  making up for that  you have to just  you know  take  the fact is  you're going to  spend the rest of your life  in jail  and you should  and you being a model  prisoner  your reward for that  should be that you're  allowed to fucking  wipe your ass  after you go to the  bathroom  I know model prisoners  are great  but if you stab  a pregnant woman  you should never  get out for being  a model  you should just  not be tortured  because you've been  a model prisoner  make it a little  easier in prison  I guess  but that's about it  then there was  a ranch hand  at that stupid  ranch that they 
[01:07:00]  stayed at  that Manson  and I think  Tex wound up  killing  and they dumped  his body  and that body  wasn't found  until 1977  wow  yeah  they found that  they weren't able  to really get  enough evidence  and also  Manson's first  attorney  was found dead  and they suspect  that Manson  did it  but  no evidence  and then the tie-ins  with the Beach Boys  and the whole  Hollywood scene  and the underground  music scene 
[01:07:30]  just really  interesting shit  what was the motive  behind him doing that  he wanted to start  a race war  he wanted to start  a race war  he tried to make  all the murders  look like black  people did it  by like weird  means  like leaving  watermelon rinds  out  really  like eating  watermelon  and leaving  the rinds  I know  yeah  and leaving  the rinds  out  and  I know  walking around  with watermelons  and murdering people  it's crazy 
[01:08:00]  so hack  but he was hoping  to start up  the race war  but the Jews  did it  why  they were pennies  by the body  wow  that was hacky  that is a hacky thing  maybe leaving  earth, wind, and fire  album  laying around  something  watermelon rinds  one giant condom  right  Jesus  there's better ways  to do that  no  yeah  yeah  might as well  have went all in  and had chicken bones  throw the chicken bones  around  how did they catch them  what was the evidence  that first got them 
[01:08:30]  they wound up  finding a gun  they tossed a gun  they thought  with the woods  on the side of the road  and wound up  flying over  the little embankment  landing in a backyard  someone's house  and they found that  but  they had arrested them  for  damaging  equipment  it was something  that wasn't even  involving  murder  and  some people  just started talking  they started getting wind  that they had done it 
[01:09:00]  yeah  how do they call them  oh yeah  didn't one of them  go to jail  and like  start telling  his cellmate  started  yapping about it  it's always the way  was that Tex  I think Tex  was a loud mouth  Tex  Watson right  Tex Watson  yeah  but Manson wanted to be  the only Charles in the family  so they had to call him Tex  Tex  we got Christine  she's been studying  the Manson murders  for 20 plus years  oh  Christine  hi  what can you add  did you see this documentary 
[01:09:30]  Anthony's talking about  I don't know  I just turned on the radio  I've actually been to the house  I actually have a part of the  Sharon Tate house  I've been on tours  I've  went to the 40th anniversary  so I'm pretty into this  can I ask you what the attraction is  I'm just curious  that's  yeah  yeah I don't know  just I guess the heinous crime  just  so how far  crazy it was  but you were talking about  how they first got nabbed  Susan Atkins  was in jail  for I don't know 
[01:10:00]  for some  something  she started talking  and they actually found some  they were  convicted in  I guess  Charles Manson  for earth moving equipment  yeah  yeah  stolen some kind of  earth moving equipment  yeah  some bogus charge  and  you know  Susan started talking  and everything else  thank god she's dead  she died of  I guess  brain cancer  so  I don't know  was her name  Susan  was it Atkins  Susan Atkins  yeah Atkins  died  in 2009 
[01:10:30]  September 2009  bon voyage  yeah  good riddance to her  so and she actually  wanted clemency  she wanted to get out  she was the one  right  yeah  yeah  for sympathy  because she was dying  fuck her  I'm sorry  wow  anyway  yeah  but uh  yeah  but Clem Grogan  Steve Grogan  his nickname was Clem  he actually got out  yeah he did have  like a mental illness  um  he was a little  you know  slow  but um  he wound up  getting out  because he actually  uh  you know  he worked with the police  he cooperated with them 
[01:11:00]  um  in helping to find  uh  Donald Shorty  Shady's body  Shorty right  he was the guy  that was in the uh  he was  he was the uh  ranch hand right  yes  yeah  and what happened  was he started  blabbing to the police  right after uh  you know  all the murders  started happening  you know  and uh  so he was considered  a snitch  so what they did  was wind up  killing him  you know  um  but there were  so many murders  so many retaliation  murders  even after uh  you know  they were all  incarcerated  there were still  family members 
[01:11:30]  going around  killing people  they killed uh  Donald uh  Ronald Hughes  who was a lawyer  who represented  a couple of the uh  you know  uh  people on trial  so  why'd they kill him  did they think  he was not a good  lawyer  uh  they just didn't  like the way  he was representing  uh  Charlie didn't like  the way he was  representing the girls  trying to get the girls  off  saying that you know  they were trying  to separate the girls  from Charlie  and trying to say  that they were  influenced  and Charlie wanted  to run the whole  defense  so  of course  the judge  wouldn't let him  represent himself  and uh  you know 
[01:12:00]  so he was trying  to you know  tell the lawyers  this is the way  you need to do it  you need to listen  to what I want  to do  and so  he  fucking kills  the lawyer  and cooperates  so  next year  one lawyer  went missing  and was later  found dead  so  yeah  god you really  do know  oh yeah  what was his hold  what was Manson's  hold over  these people  like was it  he was just  charismatic  or  well you have  to remember  a lot of these  girls were young  and they came  from families  that there was  a breakdown  in the family  I mean  Susan Atkins family  her mother died  of cancer  when she was 
[01:12:30]  like 12 years old  so  and they all  got into drugs  early  so I mean  I don't know  that they  you know  when you say  that they were  influenced  Charlie was pretty  smart  he really knew  how to target  these girls  he knew  which girls  could be  equally influenced  and a lot  of the girls  were already  strung out  on drugs  anyway  so I mean  as far as  influencing goes  it really  didn't take  too much  to influence  them  yeah  but the funny  thing is  though  you know  who was it  it was  oh gosh  Bobby Bolesale 
[01:13:00]  had got  convicted  or had  put in jail  for the murder  for Gary Hinman  who was a music  teacher who was  friends with the  family  and the girls  were really  upset about that  why was he killed  he was called  Cupid  and he was  one of the  cuter guys  I guess  in the gang  and the family  part of me  and you know  what happened  was when he  got picked up  for driving  around in  Gary Hinman's  car a couple  days after  the murder  and that murder  took place  in late July  I think July  29th  and the girls 
[01:13:30]  were really  upset about it  and they were  complaining to  Charlie  so part of  the reason  why Helter  Skelter  happened  was because  Charlie said  well maybe  if I killed  some people  the way Gary  killed someone  Bobby Bolesale  killed somebody  and they'll  think that  it was a cop  they'll think  that Bobby Bolesale  wasn't the real  murderer  and the real  murderer is still  out there  right  right  yeah they were  trying to  tell the guys  yeah they thought  they'd get their  buddy out of jail  yeah yeah  by doing the  same type of  murder 
[01:14:00]  similar type  of murder  and then  the police  would go  oh well  obviously  it can't  be this  guy  because  people are  still getting  killed like  this  so we'll  let him  go  yeah  great thinking  how much  Manson  how  influential  he was  yes  but he also  had a lot  of connections  in the community  in the Hollywood  community  in fact  one of his  members  and I can't  I think it was  Brenda  I can't remember  her last name  Brenda McCann  I think  she was actually  a niece  of Angela  Lansbury 
[01:14:30]  so  yeah  we're all  these weird  family members  for a while  and I mean  he had obviously  connections with  the Beach Boys  connections with  Terry Melcher  Doris  Dave's son  what was the  connection to  the Beach Boys  I'm sorry  what was the  Beach Boys  connection  okay so  Patricia Krenwinkel  and another girl  in the family  were hitchhiking  along  Pacific Coast Highway  and  who was  at Dennis Wilson  picked him up  one night  and he  brought him home  had sex with him  then he had to  go to a recording  session at his  brother Brian's house 
[01:15:00]  and he left  the girls at his  house  and when he  came back  later that night  the whole family  had pretty much  moved in  came to his  house and moved in  he comes out  and he like  worships  Dennis Wilson  he gets down  on his knees  kisses his feet  you know  and Dennis was  a little taken  back  but he's like  I'm not gonna  hurt you man  and basically  Dennis Wilson  adopted the whole  family  and they basically  live there  and they  basically  you know  stole all of  his money  used his cars  I mean 
[01:15:30]  Dennis Wilson  paid for like  a hospital bill  because they all  had like  gonorrhea  and herpes  and what not  it was like  a thousand dollar  hospital bill  they wrecked his  car  they stole  some of his  gold records  and sold them  for you know  drug money  and shit  but did Charlie  like Dennis  Charlie  loved Dennis  but that was  Charlie thought  that was his  connection  into the music  world  yeah  you thought  he was gonna  be a big star  I have his  record  Manson's songs  do you  you hear them  yeah  I heard them  last night  yeah  on the documentary 
[01:16:00]  I heard a couple  yeah  yeah  so  and um  so  that's how  he got  Charlie Manson  got involved  with Terry  Melcher  who was a  record producer  for the time  for the Birds  for the Beach Boys  and so  you know  Terry Melcher  came out  to the ranch  one day  to listen to them  play  and he gave  them $50  because he felt  bad for them  but he knew  that they weren't  all that good  Charlie Manson  put that $50  as a promise  to make a record  and so  you know  he kept  hounding  Terry Melcher  when are you  gonna you know 
[01:16:30]  record us  when are you  gonna record us  and uh  finally  you know  everything just  spiraled out of  control  I guess  in the summer  of 69  just so many  things converged  and came together  to create  what happened  and uh  you know  some people  say some  you know  people who have  been really  saying the murder  say that you  know  some of the  family members  tried to doubt  Charlie  and so you  know  he was losing  control of his  family  and so you  know  talking about  all this  helter-skelter  and yada yada  yada  and finally  you know  he had to do  something  to prove 
[01:17:00]  that it was  true  you don't yada  Charles Manson  yeah you don't yada  yeah exactly  you don't yada yada  the man who  will eventually  have a swastika  on his forehead  that was a bad  choice  was Terry Melcher  killed or no  no  in fact  you know  he went  I don't know  if you know  Charles Manson  actually came  to face  with Sharon  Tate  on  I think it  was March  23rd  1969  she was  about to leave  for Europe  and he came  to the front  door  Charlie  and he met  with Sharon  Tate's  photographer  and big 
[01:17:30]  Iranian guy  and Shatoki  or something  of that  I can't remember  his name  but anyway  Terry Melcher  was living  at that point  in the guest  house  and so  Sharon Tate's  photographer said  oh yeah  go in the back  alley  he's back  there  and Charlie  was really  insulted by that  but standing  behind the  photographer  was Sharon Tate  and she  actually looked  him in the  face  and later  remarked  to her  photographer  that guy  gave me  the crepes  but  no 
[01:18:00]  Terry Melcher  didn't die  he died  many many  years later  it's  just an  amazing  story  and  like I  said  that  documentary  Six Degrees  of Helter  Skelter  kind of  gives you  a different  take on  it  well that's  the guy  I went  on his  tour  I guess  Scott  Michael  and he  has a  Facebook  page  Dealer  Departed  and you  know  he is  like the  total expert  I mean  this guy  does everything 
[01:18:30]  it was  really  the little  subtle  things that  he was  showing  on the  documentary  are pretty  cool  things you  don't really  know or  haven't seen  in previous  documentaries  did Squeaky  Fromm get  out of jail  this is  Squeaky  we're talking  to her  right now  you try to  assassinate a  president and  you get out  of jail  with the  Democratic  president  her ass  would still  be in jail  that's just  my opinion  is she out  yeah she's  out 
[01:19:00]  she got out  in 2009  wow she did  huh  yeah she  did  was she  done  the murders  or no  she never  murdered  and you  know what  she was  like  Charles  Manson's  like top  you know  when Charles  wasn't around  he put her  in charge  but the funny  thing is  like he  never sent  her on the  murders that  night because  I think he  knew in his  heart Charlie  that she  just couldn't  murder  like even  with Gerald  Ford  like you know  even though she  tried to  assassinate Gerald  Ford  there were  really supposedly 
[01:19:30]  no bullets  in the chamber  so I think  it was just  a threat  so you know  but  what is she  doing now  yeah good  question  not only knows  but you know  the funny thing  is like  Sandra Good  we probably  should keep  track of her  maybe  we should  probably tag her  yeah yeah  probably should  get a tag on her  does she have  a twitter account  or a facebook  page  little Lynette  squeaky  squeakster  psychos out there  love her and  probably worship her  but the funny  thing is she  and Sandra Good 
[01:20:00]  were part of  this  I don't know  trees  air  water  some organization  that Charlie  started  and they were  supposed to  they're not  allowed to be  like associate  with one another  Sandra and  no I bet  can't get those  two together  but  but squeaky  she's in that  case  yeah she was  one of the girls  that used to  go to the trial  and support  Chuck  it's creepy  how much you  know about this  yeah yeah  yeah  you never really  you never really  explained why  that this  this is your 
[01:20:30]  thing  okay here's  the deal  my dad  was a cop  and uh  you know  I guess  you know  being a cop  he was  you know  into true  crimes  and stuff  like that  I remember  when  and this  what I  what I  consider to  be the best  movie on  the Helter  Skelter  movies  was the  TV movie  that came  out in  1976  I remember  that one  Helter  Skelter  yeah with  Charles  with uh  Steve  Railsback  oh my god  he did a  good Charles  Manson  yeah  amazing  but uh  in a creepy  way  but uh 
[01:21:00]  the thing  is you know  my dad  he was like  hey why don't  we watch  this you know  and I'm here  I'm like  eight years  old  and he was  just into  true crimes  and from that  point on  I was just  like obsessed  with him  and I think  a lot of  people are  obsessed with  it because  of his  connections  to Hollywood  because  yeah it's  that  but killers  like that  just the  strange  shit that  they do  it's fascinating  to people  the John Wayne  Gacy story  and all those 
[01:21:30]  you know  the other serial  killers around  the country  over the years  it fascinates  people  they love  seeing where  these things  happened  and touching  a little piece  of memorabilia  from it  I don't know  what it is  I don't know  what the  fascination is  I'm not even  saying it's an  odd thing  because so many  people are into  it  look at the  ID channel  look at all  these CSI  yeah yeah  there's so  many crime  shows  real crime  shows on  TV  and they're  great  I watch a 
[01:22:00]  shitload of  them on  Discovery  ID  oh yeah  we gotta  hold on  hold on  the line  we got  this guy  Billy  he says  his mom  served  with  Squeaky  okay  served  where  Billy in  Houston  oh in  jail  hey guys  how you  doing  my mom  was in  federal prison  in Fort  Worth  wait wait  why was  she in  federal prison  in Fort  Worth  embezzlement  embezzlement  how many years  call a crime  nice  how many years  did she get  she got five  she served 17 months 
[01:22:30]  okay go ahead  so anyway  when she first  got transferred  to a prison  in Fort  Worth  she was put  in the same  dorm  with Squeaky  she was in  there for about  two or three  months  she said  and Squeaky  constantly carried  around this  teddy bear  she said  she was the  weirdest  fucking bitch  my mom  had ever met  in her life  you know  my mom  that hippie  everything else  but she said  eventually  Squeaky  would walk  around  to the other  there were  four people  to a dorm  and she would  walk around  and touch 
[01:23:00]  these other  people at night  and just  talk to them  like they were  dolls or something  how do you  shut your eyes  and go to sleep  when Squeaky  Fromm's walking  around the room  yeah exactly  and so  I went up there  to visit her  and you know  it's true  what they say  about these  federal prisons  it's like a  fucking  it's like a club  you know  you walk in  they're wearing  scrubs  there's not  any real  armed guards  it's like that  it's like a  let's dream  for Jim  you know  and so  anyways 
[01:23:30]  you know  she tells me  yeah I'm  serving with  Squeaky Fromm  and I'm like  who?  she goes  Squeaky  one of the  people from  the Manson murders  and the entire  visit I'm asking  her about this  chick  and she says  she rarely  comes outside  that she's  in a world  all of her own  that if she  does speak  to you  she's not  speaking to you  she's kind of  speaking through  you  she said  it was just  very surreal  to this day  after that  my mom  will not  go up  to a movie  theater  she can't 
[01:24:00]  stand being  in her room  with other  people in the  dark  and she  claims to  the shit  that's weak  you did to  her  so your mom  can't go watch  a movie  because she  served with  some wacko  who held  a teddy bear  right  doesn't make  sense  she won't  say shit  about what  happened  but she  will not  go into  a movie  theater  that's so  weird  she was only  there for a few  months with her  it wasn't like  Lynette did  anything bad  to her  so your mom  can't go watch  Godzilla  who would want  to watch  Godzilla  they made  the god damn  thing four 
[01:24:30]  times because  it sucked  every time  that is true  alright  thank you  thank you  Christine  anything else  not that I  can add  your name's  not Christine  Christine  yeah  anything else  I mean  you were talking  about the girls  you know  obviously  Susan died  Texas  you know  Texas  still in jail  and you know  of the two  remaining girls  Patricia Krenwinkel  and Leslie Van  Howden  we were talking  about them 
[01:25:00]  Leslie yeah  she's the closest  one to getting  out of jail  but honestly  I don't feel  that she has  any remorse  the only one  I actually  there was an  interview with  Diane Sawyer  I guess it was  back in 2000  Diane Sawyer  was involved  Patricia Krenwinkel  actually seems  the only one  remorseful  and she's even  said I didn't  even ask to  get out of jail  no  like I killed  these people  and the thing  that pisses  me off is  they got away  with it  they had the  death penalty  yeah yeah  it was supposed  to be executed 
[01:25:30]  in 1972  yeah  they had  any remorse  they wouldn't  ask to get  out at all  yeah they're  all paid  remorseful  yeah yeah  if you skate  the death penalty  because they  changed the law  you should never  ever get out  yeah well  you know who's a  big proponent  of Leslie Van  Howden getting out  is John Waters  so  really  why  he constantly  is you know  campaigning  for her to get  out of jail  so and I  think part of  that's because  supposedly  when Leslie Van 
[01:26:00]  Howden was  stabbing  Rosemary La  Bianca  she was already  dead  but here's the  thing  she didn't know  that she was  already dead  yeah yeah  not only that  she was upset  that she didn't  get to go the  first night  so don't tell  me that this  bitch has  any remorse  look if you  show up  if you go  somewhere where  you know  you're going  to murder  people  and then someone  is stabbed  to death  and you just  stabbed them  when they're  already dead  fuck you  you're guilty  guilty  prison  life  I know  Deborah  Kate just  came out  with a new 
[01:26:30]  book  that's on  the market  a dedication  to her  sister  and it's  pretty good  it's almost  a tutorial  and a lot  of Hollywood  people are  quoted in it  and I'll  kind of give  that a little  promotion  but I got  mine this  week  it came out  I guess  last week  it came out  she loves  murder  this girl  loves murder  yeah I know  anyway  why couldn't  your dad  put a Disney  movie on  yeah right  dad really  set you  on a weird  path  oh you know  what else 
[01:27:00]  got me into  this also  being from  New York  you know  son of Sam  was happening  in the 70s  and so  you know  my parents  would sit  around in  the summer  with people  across the street  who were from  Brooklyn  and my father  was from the  Bronx  my mother  was from  Queens  they're standing  around the  paper like  oh my god  a murder  happened here  world travelers  so you know  I'm sitting  here listening  to it as a  child  and I'm like  you know  son of Sam  son of Sam  who's son of Sam  you know  yeah that was  pretty creepy  when that shit  was going on  absolutely  I remember that 
[01:27:30]  shit  yeah  well Christina  thank you very much  where on Long Island  are you from  well it was in  Huntington  yes  alright  F.H.

[01:28:30]  and he's crazy  Charles Krautmeier  will never get out  of jail  he knows  this is his real name  yeah  so what's the  documentary again  I see you're getting  cheeky  I'm cheeky  but I'm truthful  cheeky and truthful  sometimes meld  the six degrees  of helter skelter  go check it out  that's what I  watched last night  yeah that was my  documentary of the  evening  nice  sometimes you get  a good one  I like that Netflix  god damn  you could just  you realize when you're 
[01:29:00]  going through the  same fucking  channels on your  cable system  and it's like  there's nothing on  there's nothing on  you got  pop to Netflix  Netflix or that  Amazon is really  good too  I've been noticing  that I was  watching something  I put it on  Netflix and  Netflix has been  having a problem  with their god damn  bandwidth and the  picture was very  pixel 80 and stuff  so I went to  Amazon got the  same show I was  going to watch  and it was crystal  clear so you know  between those two  you find a lot of  good shit  Iraq 
[01:29:30]  you see that  thing that  Verizon sent  Netflix a  cease and desist  because they got  strong armed by  Verizon and  Comcast to pay  that fee so  that they could  stream their  stuff with a  higher bandwidth  to the cable  companies well now  when there's  bandwidth problems  Netflix has this  thing where it  pops up a warning  saying your  bandwidth is you  know being used  somewhere else  some refineress  established a  connection  Verizon sent a  cease and desist  saying you can't  do that anymore  you can't let  people know that 
[01:30:00]  the bandwidth  issue  no that's not  what it was  uh oh  oh you're saying  that last guy was  an asshole  that last employee  was a fool  Netflix sent out a  thing that said  specifically Verizon  it was a shot at  Verizon  yeah  so the message  takes a shot at  Verizon  so Verizon said  you can't put up  a message that  takes a shot at  us  oh  oh the message  that pops up  says hey Verizon's  a bunch of  assholes and  that's why your  picture sucks right  now  yes  wow  but were they 
[01:30:30]  using it was  it true what  they're saying  because Verizon  wouldn't pay their  fucking the fee  that they wanted  right  no it's  protection money  Netflix was  forced to pay  these fees to  Verizon and to  Comcast in order to  get the bandwidth to  stream their service  I don't know all I  know is I want to  fucking rent a  goddamn movie with  good quality you buy  all this HD shit  it's supposed to  look all nice and  then you stream it  and it looks like  crap I'll just go to 
[01:31:00]  Amazon I don't give  a shit Hulu  so we're slightly  out of focus  yeah you're like  what the fuck is  this I didn't pay for  this shite  your movie's on  voodoo too  voodoo  voodoo  there aren't a lot  of providers so  you go back and  forth between some  you'll find everything  you're looking for  and it's it's out  there you're not a  slave to the TV  anymore  what about the  Xbox I love that  Xbox  everything's on the  Xbox  do we have one to  give away  love it  still talk to her  oh man  just call me  Jesus  the Xbox

[01:34:30]  all right  what else  is going  on today  I know  we got  a mayor  that's  being a  naughty  boy  another one  I don't  know when  Mike you  are  how's that  there we  go  yeah  they had to  rewire stuff  in the studio  again today  yeah  whatever  what uh  what what  city is this  naughty mayor  San Marino 
[01:35:00]  California  caught on  video  throwing  dog shit  on his  neighbor's  lawn  why is he  doing this  I guess  he obviously  has a problem  with his  neighbor  why aren't  all of us  so uh  did he  apologize  yeah  no he did  he did  he said  something about  it was a  terrible mistake  and I'm  embarrassed  yeah he said  he took  whatever  he said 
[01:35:30]  he was  sorry  oh you're not  joking  no it was  uh  he said  I take  responsibility  for what  happened  I'm sorry  it happened  it was a  mistake  sometimes I'm  purposely cheeky  yes that is  true  sometimes  let's see  I don't see  this story  that you just  read  oh wait  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh 
[01:36:00]  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  the mayor of San Marino was caught on camera throwing dog feces into his neighbor's yard  you should be able to say dog shit  dog shit in the neighbor's yard  you should be able to say dog shit  he was tossing loads of dog shit  right  I think it softens up the shit  yeah  the shit word  feces  feces sounds stupid  I hate the technical term for anything that is supposed to be dirty when you just talk about it 
[01:36:30]  yeah because as soon as you hear feces you're thinking shit  so you're like oh dog feces  oh he oh I see  he threw dog shit in his neighbor's yard  penis  vagina  right  all that shit  yeah  peck-a-cuda  yeah  right  but why is  language is so dumb  it really is  like why is feces acceptable on the news but you can't say shit  it's the same thing  it's the same fucking thing  you're talking about the same thing but one word is okay to say 
[01:37:00]  the other isn't but they both conjure up the image  that is so dumb if you really just break it down  yeah  feces  all right  shit  oh  right  that gets reaction I guess  doesn't make sense  it doesn't make any sense  words are just stupid  words are just stupid words  yes  all right go ahead there  Sam  mayor  the guy in the yard and he reportedly admits doing it  this video was posted on whittier daily news last night  it shows mayor denis nyer tossing a bag of dog waste onto philip lowes walkway 
[01:37:30]  lost all cbs too  He thinks it was in retaliation because he opposes the neighborhood dog park.  The mayor reportedly said he found the bag and should have left it or thrown it away.  Nyer claims he wrote Lyle an apology letter.  Ah, so there you go.  The apology.  He also, oh, in a statement he admitted it, yeah.  He only apologized because he got caught.  Of course.  Yeah.  He never would have said, by the way, I threw dog shit on your...  And I'm so sorry about that. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, really?  With you?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  You should have put it in a paper bag.  Light it on fire and ring the bell and run.  Has anyone actually done that?  I don't know, but it's just great fucking...  You've done it.  No, no, I haven't.  I mean, I know it's been done.  Then you stomp on it.  So sorry.  It's all shit on your foot.  That's a great prank.  That is...  Whoever invented that gag, someone had to do it for the first time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He probably was like, you know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to put shit on some guy's steps out by his door. 
[01:38:30]  And he'll open the door and step in it.  Right.  And then the guy opened the door and he's watching.  And the guy goes, oh, there's shit down there.  Oh.  And he avoided it.  He's like, fuck, how can I get him to step on it?  What do you step on?  Maybe I'll put it in a bag or something.  And then he'll step on it.  Oh.  And then he avoids it again.  Right.  And then the guy goes, if I light that fucking bag on fire, this son of a bitch is going to  stomp it out.  And this dog shit.  Yes.  It's the progression of a great joke.  But with that said, who is falling for that prank nowadays? 
[01:39:00]  Nowadays.  You see a bag burning on your front stoop.  You're not stomping on it.  You have to though.  You're not stomping on it.  Oh, that's true.  You have to think immediately that it's a bag full of shit and you take the place, you  know, the welcome mat or something.  Yeah.  There's someone in their 20s.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe they do.  That's an old joke.  That's an old joke.  That's ridiculous.  I want to see the commercial that they're running.  Yeah.  We got to do another apology though, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  One more apology.  It's a quick and easy one. 
[01:39:30]  As we try to go 10 lousy days on the opening Anthony show without an apology.  I think the mayor apology counts, right?  Yeah.  News.  And then MSNBC is apologizing yet again, they say.  MSNBC's, how do you say his name?  The T-O-U-R-E guy.  Toray.  Toray.  Toray, because they have that thing over the E. That's why you go Toray.  Toray.  Had to apologize.  Do we have the clip?  On behalf of the network yet again, after the cycle forgot to bleep out Dave Chappelle  saying motherfuckers in a clip on Monday's program. 
[01:40:00]  Whoops.  But I think you're allowed to say motherfuckers on MSNBC, right?  Absolutely.  MSNBC, right?  Yep.  So why are you apologizing?  Well, you're apologizing.  Maybe it's not policy.  That would be offended.  But maybe it's not policy to, you know, have motherfucker on your network.  But if you're technically allowed to have it and it happens, whatever.  Well, you still got to apologize to the people that were offended hearing it.  Who was offended?  People would say I was watching with like kids watching for the news.  Exactly.  There's always going to be somebody offended.  Here's the apology. 
[01:40:30]  I think you have it, right?  No, I have other apologies.  Before we go to break yesterday on this program, one of the tapes we played had offensive and  inappropriate language.  He said, we sincerely, oh, they didn't go with deeply, we sincerely apologize for our  mistake.  So.  Hmm.  And then another guy had to apologize.  They just keep apologizing.  Do you have the clip where he actually?  In the previous hour, MSNBC aired a piece of tape with offensive language.  The network obviously did not intend for that language to air. 
[01:41:00]  And MSNBC apologizes to our viewers.  And they can't stop saying a fucking sorry over there.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  Especially if it was by accident.  Who cares?  But you're addicted to it.  Do we have the clip?  Mm-mm.  Oh, man.  I wanted to hear him say fuck.  Motherfuck.  I love the good motherfuck.  Motherfuck.  I think this is the apology.  Ah.  Yeah.  Congresswoman Murphy, thank you.  Thanks, Ryan. 
[01:41:30]  Thanks, everybody.  Before we go to break, yesterday on the program, one of the tapes we played had offensive and  inappropriate language.  We sincerely apologize for our mistake.  It was yesterday.  Let it go.  What the fuck?  Who's going to remember?  God.  We sincerely, deeply, and sincerely deeply apologize.  It will never happen again.  We apologize.  We will do everything we can to make sure this never happens again. 
[01:42:00]  Typically, the taxi commission is looking for people that actually rode with De Niro when  he was making taxi driver.  Right.  He actually had to get a taxi, not had to, but he got a taxi license so he could kind  of get, you know, get the gist of what it's like to drive a cab in New York and drove  people around.  Did he really drive people around?  Yeah.  Wow.  Picked up people, dropped them off.  So I guess now they're looking for people that rode with him, if they remember. 
[01:42:30]  Why?  I guess they want to interview them for something.  Why wouldn't you just step forward and say, yeah, he picked me up?  Because how could anyone prove it?  Yeah, he sucked my dick in the backseat.  Yeah.  I picked him up.  He kept saying, I actually said to him, hey, you talking to me?  And he went, hey, I'm going to use that in my movie.  Right.  Why wouldn't you just step forward?  Yeah.  Why not?  Just lie about it.  You know, if he even talked to the guy, it was, you know, stupid small talk.  Yeah.  It was like 1970.  Yeah.  He picked me up on 17th Street and he got me up to 38th. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  It was really unremarkable because he wasn't really Robert De Niro then.  He got a hack license.  That's amazing what a method actor like will do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They go through all that shit.  They have to actually do it.  You know, you can't play a cab driver unless you actually drive a cab.  It's dumb.  It really is.  It's really a stupid, stupid thing they're looking for.  It's to act.  There's little things they probably get out of it, though. 
[01:43:30]  Like, little mannerisms or a little, like, all right, all right, like, just trying to  shut the fucking window, whatever it is that they get out of it.  Yeah, maybe.  It's all this weird little experience stuff, I'm guessing.  That cab drivers would notice at the movies.  He didn't do that right.  Well, that just makes you better in the scene.  Yeah.  You know, I would just probably just go, like, hello, I'm taxiing.  Where can I taxi you to?  It would be terrible.  Yeah.  That wouldn't be a good portrayal.  No.  Yeah, so Jimmy wants to see the anti-redskin ad that will play during the NBA Finals. 
[01:44:00]  Who paid for this?  Some American Indians.  The engines?  The Hayas paid for this?  In certain, I guess, only certain markets.  I guess, you know, for money, they probably didn't get all markets.  Redskins are staying strong with the name change thing.  Staying strong.  Cool.  And when they fucking let one of their players say something racist without responding or  without, I'll be 100% behind them. 
[01:44:30]  Ah.  Cool hypocrisy is what you're saying?  That's the only reason I'm completely against them.  And the NFL is the way they handle every other complaint.  This is the only group that they fuck with.  They wouldn't dare do it to another group, so.  No.  That bothers me.  Selective.  It's just weird that, you know, the Redskins logo was accepted for so long.  Yeah, sure.  And now, out of nowhere, they desperately need to change it.  Because it's the times we're living in.  It's crazy.  Well, we've got to push back a little bit. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Then we should push back by having a team name of some other kind of a team name or some  other kind of a cultural thing that fucks with another group.  Do you know what I mean?  Then if every group was getting fucked with, it wouldn't be...  No, it doesn't necessarily mean you have to fuck over some other group.  But they didn't come up with these names to fuck with those groups.  Right.  Like, I played a lot of sports growing up, and we were always named after some kind  of tribe or, you know...  Yeah.  And it was because they were powerful and strong and were warriors, and, you know,  they fought, and they didn't give up and all that shit. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  At the time, I think it was a positive thing when they named all these teams after Indians.  Yes.  I think you're right.  So people are spinning it now and saying it's not a positive thing.  Well, nothing's positive now.  You even talk about a minority group, and you're...  For some reason, it's bad.  I don't get it.  I don't think they were trying to get one over on everybody with these names.  I thought they meant well at the time.  It's just the selective nature.  Now people have a problem with it.  That's all it is, is the selective nature of their stances. 
[01:46:00]  Right.  It's like the Indians are the only ones that they take the...  Well, you know...  But with every other complaint or group, these fucking pussy sports organizations bend over  and go, we're so sorry we didn't mean to...  He's been suspended for bullying.  He's...  There's a no-N-word policy on the field.  Boy, they can't get enough of sucking special interest dick, but this one group, they're  like, well, fuck you, too bad.  Yeah.  You think they're going to do that N-word thing, for real?  I don't know. 
[01:46:30]  That 15-yard penalty?  Field.  For certain language?  Right.  Sure.  It won't be white players saying it.  That is nuts.  I know.  All right.  Let's see the ad.  The anti-redskin ad.  Oh, boy.  Proud.  It starts.  Forgotten.  Silly Indian.  Navajo.  Blackfoot.  Hakawi.  Inuit.  And Sioux.  Survivor.  Sioux. 
[01:47:00]  Spiritualist.  Sioux everyone.  Patriot.  Sitting Bull.  Hiawatha.  And Jim Thorpe.  Mother.  Father.  Son.  Daughter.  You get it.  Chief.  Mills.  Geronimo.  Unyielding.  Strong.  Indomitable.  Yeah.  That's why they live.  Native Americans call themselves many things, but not the one thing they don't. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, they don't say the word, though.  Oh, they just show the helmet.  Get the fuck out of here.  They show the football helmet.  But they don't say the word.  No.  That would have been more powerful.  I don't know.  I think the thing is, one thing they don't, so they don't say it.  I get it.  Get some other dummy to say it.  What?  Red skin?  Just have a good fun.  Oh, God.  A good ball.  That was, uh... 
[01:48:00]  I don't know, man.  It's almost like when they wanted people to pay attention to certain drug commercials,  they had to say, like, what would make you look at the TV?  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Silence.  And they went silent because it was the jarring nature of a lack of...  So you pop up.  That's more effective.  But that's not why they did that.  They weren't brave enough to say red skin.  So they figured out another way that absolutely...  Oh, can you say brave?  I don't know.  So they found a better way to do it, and it is pretty dramatic.  But, you know...  I don't think it wasn't that they were brave enough.  Yeah, I think... 
[01:48:30]  I see it as they won't say it, not because they don't have the courage to say it.  It's just more effective not saying it.  Have you watched the end of that again, like, the last 10 seconds?  Yes.  I really think that they just dropped it off because they thought that's a powerful image.  Yes.  Yeah.  It works.  I could argue that point.  The one thing they don't, and then it's just that.  Let's say it.  Like, the one thing we don't say is red skin. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, it's just the helmet.  All right.  The helmet.  The helmet.  Pinch the helmet.  The hat.  It's a football hat.  What about the Vikings, though?  I mean, that...  They were just a brutal...  I don't think Vikings are complaining, though.  And are Vikings, like, really necessarily a group now?  But they were brutal.  They did some fun things. 
[01:49:30]  But they're not complaining.  Yeah.  Who are they now?  Yeah.  Like, what Vikings are around?  And what Vikings live here?  Cool people.  There's a guy that...  There's no way...  All right.  Let me just take this call.  Jared in Colorado.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  I just want to say, you know, my family's from Norway.  And it just pisses me the fuck off when I hear about the Minnesota Vikings.  Every time I hear Vikings, I just want to punch myself right in the dick.  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't think anybody's believing you. 
[01:50:00]  I don't think anybody's believing you.  I don't think anybody's bad at the Vikings.  All right.  No one's...  Yeah.  Yeah.  But...  All right.  But really, really, how many Indians are upset about the Redskin name?  Because that's...  That should be what matters.  Not us.  I mean...  Yeah.  Not us.  And, you know, if only a small group of Indians, you know what you say?  Fuck you.  The rest of the other Indians go, fuck you.  Who cares?  Making us look like we're pussies.  I think they polled Indians, and I don't think the numbers were that impressive. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Could you find that, Sam?  Possibly?  I believe I read that somewhere.  That's well shot, though.  Yeah.  Looks nice.  Sure.  Show a lot of Indian people dressed in traditional Indian garb.  But why is it so jarring, then, to see another face on the side of a helmet?  Like, why do we think of that?  We all have the same, like, ugh.  Like, it just wouldn't happen.  So why is there that difference?  I don't know.  People hate my stance on this, and I don't care. 
[01:51:00]  It's not about censoring them, and I don't want them to be forced to change it.  I never thought twice about it.  I just thought, oh, Redskins, okay, they're playing, you know, the Giants this weekend.  Who cares?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because I just know that so many teams were just named after Indian tribes and Indian names  and stuff, because they really believed, you know, they were powerful, strong, all that  shit.  Yeah, everything they were talking about was, you know, what Indians are.  That's the reason they put it on the side, not as a goof.  Like, hey, we're a football team. 
[01:51:30]  We want to name, let's slap something goofy and silly on the side of our helmet that people  can make fun of.  What represents teamwork and being, you know, strong and powerful and not giving up?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So the obvious choice at the time was to name it after, you know, Indians.  You're right.  I'm sure that that was the intention.  Yeah.  So, I don't care.  Zulus are strong.  Yeah, yeah.  Zulus are very powerful and respected warriors.  Sure.  So let's have that. 
[01:52:00]  It's a black face who, whatever true to a Zulu face is, with a spear or whatever weapon  it is that they carry.  A spear.  Yeah, but to picture that, you'd go, oh, you know.  Right.  I think that would be hilarious.  I understand your point, but Zulus.  But I keep going back to the fact that you weren't trying to get, you know, get one over  on anybody when they came up with these names.  Yeah, I think you're right.  You know, but probably at the time, you're right, too, that they didn't have the balls  to go all in and say, you know, Zulus or any of that stuff.  Or now they wouldn't.  Like, right now, the Redskins would never defend. 
[01:52:30]  If there was a guy dropping N-bombs in the locker room, and he just kept saying nigger  and he couldn't stop, that fucking Redskins owner would never stand there and defend him.  No.  Never.  No.  And people got mad at the Daily or the Onion or whatever when they said, like, Jew or whatever.  A filthy kike refused it to change.  Right.  Why?  That was funny.  Yeah, that was just humor.  Yeah, it was funny.  Funny's funny.  Humor.  Yeah.  I think I like the fact that they're getting bitten by their own buckling to political correctness. 
[01:53:00]  Because if the NFL had stood tall, all this, and not buckled to any of it, or no teams had  buckled, this wouldn't be an issue.  Well, I think the NFL wants them to change the team, but I think the owner has, you know,  say over that.  I think that's what's going on here, right?  Look at the NBA.  A guy in his private conversation says stupid shit.  Yeah, yeah.  He has to sell the team.  Like, the inconsistency in professional sports is what drives me crazy.  Stop pretending that there's morals involved.  None of it is, it's all who's ever being focused on at the moment. 
[01:53:30]  Let's go to Bill in Miami.  Hey.  How about those heat?  How about those heat?  Yeah, that didn't go so well last night.  Well, they're down two to one.  I like that.  Go Spurs.  Go Spurs.  Everybody likes to hate the heat.  But real quick.  True.  That is true.  The reason they don't show it at the end of the commercial is they try to give it the  same weight as, like, the N-word.  So you're not going to have somebody say the N-word.  Right.  So the same reason you wouldn't have anybody say redskins, or now it becomes the R-word. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, I don't agree with that.  And where does the word redskins come from?  Because I've heard many things.  Right.  Me too.  I don't know.  But when they were getting ready for battle, they painted up their faces, right?  Dude, I'm not an expert on that.  And then the white man twisted that and made it into something else, maybe.  Right?  Yeah.  So it's a derogatory comment.  And, yeah, I mean, but I don't think, yeah, they didn't give it to, but my only point  was just that they're trying to give it the same weight as, you know, you would never say 
[01:54:30]  the N-word, therefore you shouldn't say the R-word.  Well, I think that, you know, let's be real honest, redskin has not been used.  I don't know how it was used back then, but, like, nigger was used to be very fucking  horrible.  Sure.  And maybe redskin was, you know, 200 years ago.  I don't know.  I think redskin was a, it wasn't a nice thing.  I don't know how mean it was supposed to be.  Hey, you know, hey, redskin, get over here.  You know, that doesn't sound like it was meant to be nice.  That's probably what the colonists called. 
[01:55:00]  Wasn't St. John's like the orange men, and they changed to the orange?  Orange men, right?  And then now they're the red storm.  Oh, God.  What is that, you know?  What is a red storm?  That's what the women go through every month.  Right.  They go through the red storm.  That's terrible.  Oh, no, wait.  No, no.  Florida State.  Syracuse was the one.  Yeah, Syracuse was the one.  Wait, was it St. John's?  They were the red men out of the red storm.  Oh, right.  You were right.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  But if you look at Florida State, they're the Seminoles, but my understanding is Seminole 
[01:55:30]  tribe has no problem.  It's, you know, they like being associated with Florida State University and the football team  and everything you're talking about with Brave Warrior.  I mean, they really embrace it.  Right.  You don't see them, you know, at the beginning of every game, they have a Seminole Indian  ride out with his spear and he shuts it down in the middle of the field and there's no  complaints whatsoever.  So it's not like you're exploiting the Seminole tribe.  The Seminole tribe sees it as... 
[01:56:00]  That is a pretty cool moment when he does that, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Comes trotting out.  Anyway, that's all I had, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Kathleen in Detroit.  She's an American Indian.  Kathleen.  Hi.  I'm just calling to say that I don't think the NFL has any place to talk and my high school  was named the Chiefs and we actually had a group come in from out of state about a year  ago that wanted to force our high school to change their name and the people of my town 
[01:56:30]  kind of fought them off.  So they haven't been forced to change it yet.  But like I said, I'm American Indian and it doesn't bother me.  Hi, how are you?  Hi, how are you?  Get that one?  Yeah.  You ever hear that one?  Yeah.  No.  All right.  So you don't care that they're called the Redskins?  No, it doesn't offend me at all.  And I think people should just stay out of it.  Right on.  But it's not about it offending you. 
[01:57:00]  I have an opinion on it, but it's not that I'm thinking for American Indians.  I'm not thinking like, well, they need to be protected.  For me, it's more of fuck you to the NFL because I'm so tired of the way this country and these  teams have handled things selectively.  Like you're either going to stand up to this fucking idiocy of political correctness or  you're going to grab your ankles and take that special interest dick.  And they have chosen every single time to take the special interest dick.  And I guess they're just not.  It's the same for the government, though. 
[01:57:30]  So they're selective as well with who they want to support and who they want to go after.  That's true.  Yes.  Yeah.  And we don't like it there either.  All right.  Thank you, Kathleen.  Well, I don't like it there.  I'm getting word that that's Johnny Depp doing the voiceover for the commercial.  Really?  Why did I say it like that?  He did.  Played Tonto.  Played Tonto.  That movie was a bust, huh?  Wow.  Do you know, I saw some of it and actually liked it.  Really?  I swear to God, yeah.  On a plane or something?  No, at home I was watching it. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, I kind of.  Yeah.  Didn't do well at all.  Let's say hi to Josh in D.C.  Josh.  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  Hey, Josh.  All right, Josh.  So, I live here in Washington, and I'm actually trying to catch my friends.  It's funny.  It's funny.  But nobody here gives a shit about the name.  Like, they just don't care.  And I feel like this is some kind of, I don't want to say propaganda or political thing like  that was mentioned before.  But it just seems like nobody cares. 
[01:58:30]  I feel like this is not something that anybody should be putting their efforts into.  I mean, people around here, they just go, it's the Redskins.  And nobody thinks of what you said earlier, Opie.  You know, it's not like when you say nigger, it associates with something bad.  When you say Redskins, every time I hear the word Redskins, I never think of an idiot.  I think of a stupid football team that my team had to play every single year, twice a year.  So, it makes no sense to me.  It seems like a very small group of people are really trying to force this among the majority,  which happens a lot in this country. 
[01:59:00]  And we end up losing.  The majority ends up losing a lot, which is crazy to me.  White men speak with forked tongue.  Well, yeah, and they're right.  It's the selective policing and the selective language enforcement that's gotten us in the situation we're in.  Certain people get targeted.  Certain people don't.  Certain people, you know what I mean?  It's the same shit that the NFL is doing there.  It's like you either are, you know, you actually stand for something or you don't.  You know what they should do?  What's that?  Rain dance before every game.  Totally fuck up every game. 
[01:59:30]  But they do play in the rain of football.  Yes.  I know, but just it would be a crowd.  It'd be all fucked up.  They'd be like, oh, it's raining again.  Yeah.  They would stop being fans if they had to go to a...  Yeah, it's always raining.  Every home game, it's raining.  The market should decide with all of it, though.  Like, technically, if people didn't go to the games, then they wouldn't make money.  If people didn't buy the redskin hats, but they do.  So, of course, they should be allowed to do what they want to do.  But that's how it should be decided with all this stuff.  Of course.  The free market should decide.  Of course.  Jesus. 
[02:00:00]  That's hilarious.  I guess good bit by Conan.  Conan did a bit where he was showing the interview with Hillary Clinton that she recently did.  Right.  And they just had her eyes being crossed and uncrossed as she's talking.  They superimposed it.  No.  Very funny.  Very wacky.  Let's go to James in Louisiana.  Yeah, I got a solution for this whole thing about the redskin.  Just come up with a team called the Pale Faces.  It balances out.  The Pale Faces.  Who cares?  It balances out. 
[02:00:30]  It balances out.  Whatever.  I wouldn't be bothering the least if a team was called the Pale Faces.  Who cares?  Crack-ass crackers.  Let's say hi to Chris in Virginia.  Chris.  Hi.  Hey.  What's up, man?  Um, I was just going to say that this just shows that the NFL has no consistent values.  Like, I agree with Jimmy that they have no integrity.  Like, you can, if they're going to, they're going to give penalties.  I hope they give penalties to people who say the N-word that it's just going to be black people. 
[02:01:00]  Like, it's going to be hilarious.  Right, yes.  When every penalty is just a black guy thing, the N-word to another black guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Like I said, they're inconsistent, Mike.  Yeah, Whitey.  They're not going to change the, uh...  They're not going to say that.  If you go to an Indian reservation and ask them, hey, are you guys offended that we're using redskins?  They'll be like, what the fuck?  We don't, what?  Get out of here, Mike.  Just buy our fucking jewelry and our cigarettes.  Shut up.  Right.  Just go to our casinos.  There you go. 
[02:01:30]  Go to our casinos.  The N-word penalty in the NFL, if that goes through, that is just completely ridiculous.  Just the fact that it's being discussed.  Right.  As they try to take each other's heads off, that's okay.  And they know they have a major problem with concussions and head injuries in the NFL.  Like, a major problem that they're trying to sweep under the rug.  Because they don't know how to handle it yet.  Because the equipment's not good enough.  But if you say the N-word, then they're going to be all up in arms.  That is ridiculous.  They don't give a fuck.  That goes to Jimmy's point, obviously. 
[02:02:00]  Huh?  Huh?  They don't give a fuck if you're going to be brain dead.  No, they don't care.  By 60 years old.  But, oh, God.  Don't you fucking say the N-word.  Holy shit.  Right.  Yeah, language is, like I said earlier, is so weird to me.  Who cares?  Yeah.  It's just stupid words in the end.  It's all professional sport.  They're all trying to be something that they're not.  And that's what drives me nuts.  Baseball is the same fucking, again, NBA with Sterling.  And yet these guys commit felonies and they're still in the league. 
[02:02:30]  Felonies.  I mean, some guy, and this happens all the time, getting convicted of drunk driving.  Which, to me, is a fuckload more dangerous than some old guy telling his girlfriend not to bring black guys to the game.  I mean, offensive, whatever you want to call it.  But as far as real, substantial danger to other people, I think the drunk driving is a lot more serious.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Well, it's the world we live in.  Yeah.  It's only going to get worse. 
[02:03:00]  It is.  It's never going to change.  I always thought, like, it's never going to change, man.  It's never going to.  We've got to push back.  But as you see, every media outlet just caters to it.  It's unbelievable.  In Canada, I heard one of the places stopped will not mention the names of these people, the killers.  The shooters and stuff.  Good.  If you're still on the loose, that's one thing.  But if you're caught, they're dead.  Because the media is absolutely making this way worse.  Much worse.  Yeah.  Absolutely making it worse.  There's been 74 school shootings since Sandy Hook.  Really? 
[02:03:30]  They add in some that aren't technically the school shootings.  That's still obviously an issue.  But, you know, they say, well, how come you guys talk about it?  You're perpetuate.  When people are doing it, they want infamy or they want to go out in a blaze of glory.  They're not looking like we want people to make fun of us on the radio and shit on us.  They want, like, their manifestos printed.  They want to be heard.  Like, they want to be heard in a certain tone.  And that's what the press gives them.  And we don't give them that. 
[02:04:00]  The press doesn't mock what small, selfish little nobodies.  They put things like the Joker's lair.  All right.  Like, the New York Post knows what they're doing and they simply don't give a fuck.  Yeah, they make these guys into, you know, the supervillains.  They don't care.  No.  That they're contributing to people getting murdered.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  The Post is a goofy paper.  Yeah, I'm fine with that.  But don't, you know.  I think they, let me see what they have here.  There was something they had today.  The Post.  Yeah.  Let me see if I can find that thing. 
[02:04:30]  Our proud New York papers.  Just rags.  A bunch of goofballs.  Rags of two and three day old news.  Right.  The only thing that's up to date is the sports.  Is the sports.  And you could have saw that, you know, last night.  Yeah.  Right after the game.  I'm trying to find it.  It might have even been in the other goofy paper.  Because they are both goofy.  Papers are so fucking obsolete.  I'm doing a new old man character.  I say things like, what are you doing over there?  Tweetering?  That's good. 
[02:05:00]  What's that?  The inner tubes?  That's a good one, too.  I just pretend I don't know technology.  Yeah, yeah.  It's funny.  Work it.  Yeah.  Get the audience to laugh.  Like, oh, you know.  Bet that doesn't happen.  Yeah, not at all.  Hey, what's this?  The IHOP pad?  What are you, the IHOP pad?  Because it's the pancake place.  Yeah.  You know, because he probably goes there.  Yeah, no, it's an iPad.  Here it is.  It is the other goofy paper, the Daily News.  So you got Derek Fisher.  He's going to be the coach of the Knicks.  Yeah.  I know most of you don't give a fuck. 
[02:05:30]  I get it.  But Carmelo Anthony might leave the team.  Oh.  So they're basically trying to say, hey, man, you know, stick around.  You know, it's the Knicks.  Uh-huh.  Time to rebuild, and we're going to be somebody.  Now that we got Phil Jackson, and now we got Derek Fisher coaching, right?  So the headline says, don't be dumb with two Ds.  Stay with Knicks.  And it's showing Carmelo Anthony's wife with a shitload of cleavage.  Double Ds?  Double D.  Don't be double D. 
[02:06:00]  It's a tit joke.  It's a tit joke is basically what I'm getting at.  Yeah.  This is the paper.  This is the newspaper.  Yeah.  It says, Knicks fans have a message for Carmelo Anthony and wife Lala.  You'd be boobs to leave.  Ah, boobs.  That's just embarrassing.  Isn't that embarrassing?  But they're the same ones that will moralize on the front page about somebody, a comedian  who says something wrong, or, you know, da-da-da, disrespects.  They're the same people.  But you'd be boobs to leave. 
[02:06:30]  That's not even close to a good line.  And then it continues.  Anthony has two big reasons to stay with the Knicks.  Why?  What does this have to do with it?  It doesn't have anything to do with it.  Just pun after pun.  How about you just tell the real story and go, oh, by the way, here's his wife's tits.  His wife with big tits.  All right.  Two big reasons to stay with the Knicks.  And then, you know, you're...  Why?  The Knicks have nothing to do with him and his wife.  Who does?  Your mind is in the gutter.  And then they go, well, the two reasons are Phil Jackson and new coach Derek Fisher. 
[02:07:00]  Ah!  We see what you do.  You clever guys.  They are clever.  But there's a picture of his wife right there with...  I mean, they're half uncovered.  Her big, giant boobies.  So, I just read this, like, this is our paper?  Fucking ridiculous.  It's, you know, it's just...  It makes you go, like, ugh.  I know they're, you know, they're in a tough spot with the internet and everything, but Jesus,  that's not going to get the job done, right?  Hmm. 
[02:07:30]  Anyway, why don't we, uh...  Are we done with the Redskins, you think?  Hmm.  I wonder what's going to happen in the...  What do you think of it?  I think eventually he changes the name.  I mean, Buckles to do it.  I don't know.  I just don't want them to be forced to change it.  Like, you can't make someone do that.  I think they'll hang in there for a while.  Maybe.  I really do.  Because there's a lot of money.  Well, there'd be...  I think there'd be more money at stake if they do change the logo, because then everyone  has to update their shit.  Yeah, they've got to buy new...  I don't know.  Buy new shit.  And then they would still buy the old shit as retro stuff. 
[02:08:00]  Although the NFL would probably force the retro stuff out.  Like, alright, now that you changed the name, I never want to see, you know, the Redskins  logo again.  Yeah.  We don't want that name.  It's racially inappropriate.  He's got four felonies and he hit his wife.  Welcome to the team.  Welcome aboard.  Yeah.  Great, great fucking consistent organization.  All right.  I want to check in with the consumer, I'm thinking, after the break.  Oh, yeah.  I was reading some of his... 
[02:08:30]  Is there new stuff?  New stuff?  Yeah.  I read some of his work last night.  We're going to check in with the consumer.  We got some clips from Dave Chappelle on Letterman, which are pretty good.  He's finally talking about, you know, what happened with him and the show and all that shit.  If you want to know what, if you should pick up some pizza SpaghettiOs, I wouldn't go anywhere.  Oh, that was the one he did.  Oh, that's one I saw.  How many did you do last night, Eric?  I think two or three, I did last night. 
[02:09:00]  Well, you're about to get a follower of someone who follows no one.  Someone has zero followers, but he will now follow you.  Is it Chip?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Chip, Chip.  He will now follow you.  We will check in with the consumer next.  Yeah, we're back.  Moving right along.  Ah, sorry.  There we are.  Jesus. 
[02:09:30]  That's buttons.  Studio's rewired again.  Dada button.  He did the dolphin story.  Make sure you listen to the replay.  Oh, yeah.  Hot.  It's a hot one.  Started off with the sexier right away.  I still can't get the image of the dolphin having sex with the fish.  The mouth of a fish.  That's the size of, what, maybe six to eight inches, eight inches, probably, something like that.  He was fucking up.  Just going to town. 
[02:10:00]  Keep fucking that chicken.  Fucking its mouth.  Let's check in with the consumer.  Ah.  Taking over the world.  Taking over Instagram.  Oh, yeah.  Are you going to make videos or what?  We've been discussing this, E-Rock.  Where are you at with the video maker?  Come on.  I think eventually I will, yes.  Eventually?  It's hot now.  Come on.  What do you think we're going to talk about the consumer every day?  It's hot right now.  So many people do fucking videos with food reviews.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, but you got the audience.  You got the built-in audience.  Yeah, that's true. 
[02:10:30]  You'll have a leg up on the competition.  They're not talking to anybody.  No, but not.  A big leg up.  You can be.  A big leg up on the competition.  Oh, yeah.  What?  That was a compliment.  Of course.  It's better than having a leg up on the competition.  Right.  A big leg up on the competition.  That's right.  Competition.  A big juicy prick up.  All right, let's check out the consumer.  It's E-Rock Radio on Instagram, and every night he's doing at least two or three things. 
[02:11:00]  He's just having a taste.  Yeah.  Are you counting the calories?  You know I should, but I'm not.  But that would be funny, too.  Yeah.  Put the calories you consume to do your review.  Well, I'm also not finishing, like, entire meals of this stuff.  No, I know.  A little sample.  A little samples here and there.  Then you throw it away.  Why would you try Emily's Dark Chocolate Covered Fortune Cookies?  Holy shit.  That just sounds terrible.  This is why I'm all in with the consumer. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  I didn't even know there was something called Emily's Dark Chocolate Covered Fortune Cookies.  How did you find out about this one?  These were sent in, and Roland handed these off to me and said, hey, why don't you do  a review on these?  So we did.  All right.  And who reads the review?  Sam, I guess?  I have in the past.  Okay.  Emily's Dark Chocolate Covered Fortune Cookies.  These were sent to us at work.  I'm not a chocolate lover.  I can't imagine.  No, am I.  I can't imagine this. 
[02:12:00]  We might.  We kind of know that by now.  Yeah.  I can't imagine one liking a chocolate-covered anything, much less a fortune cookie.  What's wrong with you?  Bland and unappetizing as those impulse-buy jelly rings next to the register.  Different, but trying too hard.  T.O.  Hashtag the consumer.  That's it for the review? 
[02:12:30]  Did you even eat them?  Oh, man.  Right?  I did.  They're horrible.  Because you don't like...  Why?  Why?  Fortune cookies are all right.  No, they're not.  Fortune cookies are such a waste.  And then you dip them in chocolate.  Yeah, well, I probably would...  If you're a chocolate lover, you like anything with chocolate.  Fortune cookies after a Chinese meal is perfect.  It's not.  There's no taste to it.  It's perfect.  That and some orange slices, and you're good.  You're eating a sponge.  Yeah, I don't like fortune cookies either.  They're weird.  I like fortune cookies.  Iraq, was there a flying in it?  Yes.  What did it say? 
[02:13:00]  If it's still on my desk, it said, an old pal will return to buy you lunch.  An old pal will return...  Better be Donald Trump.  Yeah.  Because lunch is going to be expensive.  What do they taste like, Iraq?  It's a bitter dark chocolate, and then the fortune cookie would just absorb anything that  it's paired with, so there's really no taste to a fortune cookie. 
[02:13:30]  Right.  Yeah.  So, not worth it.  Doesn't sound good.  No.  But it's one of these little boutique dessert.  Yeah, it really does look...  That women in the office would like.  Uh-huh.  You want a chocolate-covered fortune cookie?  Are you saying women are weaker than men, and that's why they would like this?  No, they just eat...  They just eat garbage.  What do you mean women eat garbage?  They do.  Like what?  Like how...  I don't want to...  I'm all right.  I'll have to phrase this different, because I don't want to... 
[02:14:00]  Just say what you're going to say.  Just say what you're going to say.  There are companies that advertise products that, you know, here at this company and other  places where it's mostly aimed towards a guy buying it for his wife at home or at her  workplace or whatever, and they're horrible treats and desserts.  Oh.  They're not the good stuff, like pizza-flavored SpaghettiOs?  Right.  Is that the next item?  Yes.  That is.  Whoa.  All right.  You should photograph your dumps.  Oh, God.  And then we could try to match them up to the food they ate. 
[02:14:30]  Like a game show.  Exactly.  You see, like, a little piece of white paper coming out of it, you're like, oh, that was  some Emily's fortune cookies.  Yes.  The new game, constipation.  Ah, there it is.  Campbell's SpaghettiOs.  Now, I never was a fan of SpaghettiOs.  I liked the raviolis in a can, but never SpaghettiOs.  I always hated SpaghettiOs.  The neat round spaghetti you can eat with a spoon.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Uh-oh. 
[02:15:00]  SpaghettiOs.  Were you a fan of SpaghettiOs?  I enjoyed them when I was a kid.  No.  I didn't like them ever.  You can eat with a spoon.  Yeah.  Oh.  The neighbors.  Yeah, you could probably...  You could probably...  You could probably...  Yeah.  Iraq, do you like regular SpaghettiOs?  Um, I used to...  They changed whatever the formula used to be.  It's not as good as I remembered it.  Because they probably had to get all the cancer fucking agents out of it.  Agents out?  Those delicious fucking carcinogens? 
[02:15:30]  I don't know if Campbell's had cancer agents in their food.  I'm just assuming they might have had some bad stuff in their food.  I said cancer agents, that's what Bob Eatman is.  Oh, God.  He stinks.  You fucking stink.  Sorry.  Jeez.  Go ahead, Eric.  Now, Iraq told everybody also that he just popped that can open,  and dumped it in a bowl, and started eating.  Yeah.  He didn't heat this up.  Now, that, to me, taints the review.  Of course it does.  Because it's supposed to be heated.  You have to eat these things as instructed on the label. 
[02:16:00]  What if he has an asterisk?  Just want to let you know I eat this cold.  But it doesn't matter.  No.  If they...  Maybe the pizza taste, which you said was a little weak and only an aftertaste.  Right.  I remember this review.  It might have brought out more of the pizza taste if it was heated up.  Flavors are very different between cold and hot.  All right.  Spaghetti O's, cheesy pizza O's.  I don't know if we officially said it. 
[02:16:30]  Yes, it's a...  New flavor right on the can, it says.  New Spaghetti O's, pizza O's, served cold out of the can.  Okay.  So he does have a little asterisk kind of thing.  Yeah, yeah.  He tells people it's cold out of the can.  Looks and tastes like regular Spaghetti O.  Uh-huh.  The pizza flavor hits as a slight aftertaste.  Uh-huh.  That's it.  Maybe the heat does something and brings that pizza taste to the forefront.  That is true.  Of course it does.  Not worth your money.  Not worth your money.  How much could a can of fucking Spaghetti O's cost?  Exactly.  A dollar nine.  A dollar nine? 
[02:17:00]  That's it.  Are you kidding me?  All the new Spaghetti O flavors have been disappointing.  What other flavors?  Hashtag the consumer.  Whatever flavor, what other flavors do they have?  They have a beef taco one, which is really gross.  And they had a cheeseburger one, which is very bland.  Well, I think you should heat them up and then eat your Spaghetti O's.  You know why?  Let me tell you why.  And I think I have a point here.  The fragrance, the aroma of a warm bowl goes up your nose, and that's part of the taste 
[02:17:30]  is smelling the food.  Cold pizza tastes different from hot pizza.  Exactly.  Cold pizza's pretty good, though.  You're not eating this properly, Iraq.  Cold pizza's pretty damn good, though.  Yeah, but if you did a review of pizza and you were like, the cheese isn't melty at all,  I'd take it right out of the fridge.  Yeah.  Then you'd be like, yeah, you didn't eat it properly.  Yeah, and you wouldn't write melty because it's not really good.  Or a hot pizza.  I'm sorry, Spaghetti O reviews.  Exactly. 
[02:18:00]  I want proper English.  Or hot pizza dipped into cold sauce.  Nice.  Hot pizza dipped into cold sauce.  Just to get a little extra sauce.  Yeah.  You dip into some cold sauce.  I could do that.  I like that.  Pizza is good enough right out of that box.  What about the place across from Fast Eddie's back in the day?  That was good.  Those giant slices.  I forgot the name of the place, but they were known for really nice slices of pizza.  And then they would throw cold cheese on top.  Oh, yeah?  They would ask for the cold cheese on top. 
[02:18:30]  And it just worked.  You had a lot of cheese.  Wait, was it regular cheese or was it like the pork?  Regular cheese they make the pizza with.  So it's a regular slice of pizza that has the cheese already, obviously.  It's all heated up.  And then you ask for a thing of cold cheese.  And they just take a whole handful and throw it on.  Oh, I like regular pizza.  But then that's melting as you're eating it.  It was great.  You can always add to pizza.  Always, right?  Right.  But I think you're fucking up these SpaghettiO reviews. 
[02:19:00]  By not heating it up.  By not heating.  You got lazy.  You got to be heated.  Why do you get lazy on this one?  That's how I've always eaten.  Yeah, but you're not.  Most people heat it.  You're trying to represent the consumer.  The consumer.  Thus then, hashtag the consumer.  Don't need to heat it up.  Because this and Chef Boyardee and all those things,  if you heat it up or eat it out of the can, it tastes the same.  No, it doesn't.  The heat will rock you.  The heat will roll you. 
[02:19:30]  Do you think it was a good song?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.  Feel the heat.  Oh, here it is.  The heat will rock you.  Nice.  Oh, my God.  The heat will roll you.  Baby, don't you know.  No.  My heat will move yourself.  So whole. 
[02:20:00]  Here we go.  Come on, come on, come on, come on.  Love me today.  Oh, John C. Reilly and this looking at him like all serious playing the guitar.  Love me tomorrow.  Trying to do the harmony.  All day, all night.  You feel my heat.  Feel, feel, feel, feel my heat.  I think we should repeat that again.  Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel my heat. 
[02:20:30]  Feel my heat.  And they say feel one too many times.  Yes, yes.  It's really great.  And John C. Reilly's ready to go feel my heat again, but he didn't do it right.  He goes feel my, feel my heat.  It's so bad.  He's underrated.  Oh, John C. Reilly has been in some great movies, obviously, but I think he's underrated.  How much you bench.  I think he should be even bigger than he is. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  He's fucking hilarious.  All right.  So you got to heat up the SpaghettiOs next time there, E-Rock.  All right.  Because you got to do what the consumer's doing.  Yes.  Most people will heat up their SpaghettiOs.  Yeah.  Did you do a third one or is that it?  No.  There's a third.  There's a third one there.  Oh, my God.  You better have heated this up.  Did you heat up?  Of course I did.  Why would you?  All right.  It's a hearty cheeseburger soup.  Campbell's Chunky Hearty Cheeseburger Soup.  Should come with a stretcher. 
[02:21:30]  Wow.  That looks thick.  How many calories is that?  I don't know.  I'll look it up right now.  All right.  Why would anybody eat cheeseburger soup?  Why wouldn't you just eat a cheeseburger?  You like soup?  You like cheeseburgers?  Shut up.  Somebody's requesting.  But no one likes soup, really.  Iraq, do a review of this, and it is a picture of cyanide.  Zan.  What an asshole.  Oh, that's just mean.  Cheeseburger soup.  Now, what is this?  Like, are there bits of burger in there? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  And the soup itself is the cheese?  Like a cheese soup?  Yeah.  All right.  You've got a lot to say about this one.  Wow.  It's 200 calories it's saying here.  Per serving.  Per serving.  How many servings per can?  That's what I'm looking at.  862.  It can't be more than two servings in a can.  What's the review?  New Campbell's Chunky Hearty Cheeseburger. 
[02:22:30]  I have yet to find a version of Chunky...  Stop your hearty cheeseburger.  Let's see.  I have yet to find a version of Chunky Soup  that doesn't smell like dog food  when you open the can.  Wow.  Wow.  I was excited to try this,  but once again,  a product using, quote,  cheeseburger flavoring  that fails to deliver.  Why are they obsessed with cheeseburger flavoring lately?  Do you know we rock? 
[02:23:00]  Everybody loves cheeseburgers,  and so they think,  oh, we'll put it into everything,  and it's always awful.  Do you like cheeseburgers?  Who doesn't?  You know what I like to taste like cheeseburger?  Pussy.  Fuck yeah.  Put some pickles in that cuda.  Thick, flavorless goop.  Wow.  With bland, half-dollar-sized burger pucks.  Loaded up with all the salt you want.  It's not going to help.  Such a shame.  Hashtag the consumer. 
[02:23:30]  Shame.  There are people dying in the world.  No kidding.  That's a shame.  That's a shame.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  The pizza joint from Huntington.  Eddie, go ahead.  Eddie.  Little Vincent's,  corner of Main Street  and New York Avenue.  Little Vincent's.  Right down the street from F.H. Riley's.  The heart of Huntington Village.  Do you work there, Eddie?  No, I don't.  No, it's just a place to go  after a night of boozing.  Yeah, everyone would just line up  after a night of boozing,  and you get your slice of pizza  with the cold cheese on top. 
[02:24:00]  Is Fast Eddie's gone?  Way gone.  A long time ago.  The Greek place across the street, too.  We used to have some gyros there, too.  The Greek.  You want the ditto?  Ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto.  No chip.  No chip.  Right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, I want to give them a plug.  Little Vincent's does a great job  with their pizza in Huntington.  Absolutely.  There's a place called Grover's  that has cheeseburger soup,  but it's homemade.  Well, how about that? 
[02:24:30]  That could be good.  But not the Campbell's chunky,  hearty cheeseburger soup, no.  Did I see Oreos are doing, like, Reese's?  Yes.  What?  That is today's review.  Oh, look at you.  I didn't know that was today's review.  I guess, you know,  we all get the same tweets.  Somebody was trying to show E-Rock  that this is happening now.  What is this?  How does this work?  It's Reese's peanut butter cup  in an Oreo.  Ooh.  All right.  So you got your Oreo cookie.  Is it the white cookie  that they're overstocked with? 
[02:25:00]  No, no, no.  All right.  And the middle,  instead of the cream,  is chocolate and peanut butter mix.  That's weird,  because you don't need  to make Reese's better.  No.  Or is it Reese's?  Maybe you need to make  the Oreo better.  Reese's?  Exactly.  So they're making the Oreo better.  But the Oreo is pretty damn good,  especially if you do that dip.  It certainly is.  I hate peanut butter, though,  so I will not.  Do you really hate peanut butter?  Well, what am I saying?  I hate chocolate.  I do not stand peanut butter.  God, I love peanut butter.  It is terrible.  Whenever it's on something, 
[02:25:30]  it just ruins it,  because it overflated  it powers everything.  No.  I hate peanut butter.  Nice and soft.  Heat it up a little bit.  I hate it.  Old dewy and shit.  Wow.  I had peanut butter,  like I ate,  in another vegan place last night,  this Blossom,  which is a great restaurant.  And the desserts,  vegan desserts are pretty fucking good,  and one of them was a chocolate  with a little peanut butter in it.  Holy shit was that tasty.  What was it made of?  I don't know.  I don't want to know.  Because they can't use the milk products, right? 
[02:26:00]  Right.  Or eggs.  But the ice cream was even good.  It's made from people.  They're almost figuring out ice cream.  I had apple cobbler,  a little ice cream.  It was phenomenal.  A lot of the supermarkets  have a lot of variety of stuff  that is ice cream,  but it's not the traditional ice cream  we all grew up with.  But they're getting close  to making it taste all right, man.  People don't like the way I say it,  but I like apple cobbler.  I mean, I really don't.  I like apple cobbler.  People don't like the way you're saying it.  No, I don't like peach cobbler. 
[02:26:30]  Feel, feel, feel.  Stop saying cobbler like that.  Or you'll need a cobbler  to pull my shoe out of your ass.  Or someone to push it in further.  One way or another.  So that's it for the consumer.  What else are you reviewing today?  I forgot to add  yesterday's alcohol selection.  Oh, right.  So I'm going to have to add that today.  What was it?  It was a nice vanilla cream ale. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, right.  He was talking about that yesterday.  I like vanilla cream.  I want to be in a live consumer  taping one time.  I want to go  and watch the consumer in action.  Watch and consume.  What do you mean?  You should just do it here.  That's true.  Really should.  Do you got the Oreos right now?  No.  We'll get them.  That's a segment of the show  right there, right here.  Right.  Instead of just reading the reviews  you're doing at home,  why don't you do the next one live?  That would be huge for your fan base.  Take a little taste.  You go through your whole ritual.  Do it now or get something.  Right.  We still have time.  I would love to see a real review  the way you actually do it. 
[02:27:30]  That's right.  Can we get the Oreos?  The Reese's Oreos?  I cannot do them nude.  Yeah, you know.  Do them all nude.  Monopoly pieces  forced into his asshole.  He can't enjoy a meal  without that little silver shoe  causing blood.  Sammy, we want the consumer  to do this live on our show.  That sounds like a great idea.  But we have an hour.  We still want to do it.  Can we get the Oreos quickly?  Those Oreos?  Yeah.  The Reese's ones?  Yeah, how do you get those Oreos, 
[02:28:00]  you know?  They're in stores now.  Maybe Dwayne Reed downstairs  has them.  Well, have somebody who,  yeah, have somebody  just run out there  and get some deodorant  and grab some fucking...  Why deodorant?  I heard that.  Nothing.  Who stinks?  I'm not saying it stinks.  I'm just saying it  while they're out there.  There's a new deodorant  I want to try.  It's this holistic...  Not holistic.  Natural stuff.  Who smells?  No one.  Who smells, Sam?  Sam, does someone smell?  Why are you laughing?  Who stinks around here?  I don't know.  Adrian.  Adrian. 
[02:28:30]  Adrian?  I don't stink.  Adrian?  Again?  Did he ever stunk before,  did he?  I heard...  No.  I heard somebody  was saying that he stunk.  What happened?  I don't know.  I think he's just  trying to get air time.  That's pretty desperate then.  Yeah.  He was working pretty hard.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  Running around.  Humid out.  Something like that.  Do you stink?  Apparently.  Oh, shit.  I didn't notice it.  What happened, to be honest.  How close do you have to be  to smell his stink? 
[02:29:00]  I don't know.  He's got a bunch of stuff  on him now,  because he's been sprayed  with cologne,  and E-Rock doused him  with Febreze.  E-Rock, how bad did he smell?  Well, I didn't smell it,  really, this morning  when he came in,  but there was quite an issue  about it during the pre-show.  So when he came in,  I just kind of hosed him  down with Febreze.  Oh, so this is a non-issue, then.  Sal and Mars had huge problems  with him this morning.  Here comes the very well-coiffed sal.  Exactly.  It smells like roses. 
[02:29:30]  What?  I'm losing my hair  no matter what.  So I try to style it.  Are you really?  Yeah, it sucks.  What happened?  Where?  Where are you losing your hair?  I don't see it.  No?  Then I must be bald.  No.  Where are you losing your hair?  I don't know.  It just happened in, like, high school.  Oh, no.  What?  I didn't see it.  How old are you?  20, going to be 24.  Oh, boy.  Then you're already losing hair at 24?  I don't know what I'm going to do.  Let me see the top.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no. 
[02:30:00]  There's a few parts up there.  You look like fucking Mindy's father.  I'm working with you.  Oh, God.  The part was a little wide up there.  A little wide.  A couple of parts.  A little wide.  But, yeah.  Sam was starting out the pre-show this morning.  And Adrian was shadowing me, as Yorick likes to say, on the board.  And Adrian came over and did the, you know, the...  Hands on hips?  Hands on the hips move.  Yeah.  And I got...  On your hips?  No.  I wish.  It fucking stunk.  It was really, really bad. 
[02:30:30]  And I was pointing at Adrian, like, go away.  Please, please, go away.  He's shooting me away immediately.  Wow.  What happened?  A little humid?  What was I...  Stop drinking?  No, I was doing Bobby's podcast last night.  Bob Kelly?  Yeah.  What do you do for his podcast?  I've been there for about three weeks.  He's trained me to do all the audio with it.  Oh, okay.  Last night I was doing a video stream on it.  So I got in about 2 a.m.  Passed out and I woke up late and...  Just came in.  Jumped in. 
[02:31:00]  Showered for, like, 30 seconds.  Jumped out and had to run.  Over to the pass station to get here.  Oh, boy.  And it's, like I said, pretty humid out there.  And I've been wearing this hat for...  Since yesterday morning.  He said he fell asleep in his hat.  Oh, no.  Does the inside of your hat smell?  Yeah.  Sal, would you smell the inside of his hat?  Just come in.  It stinks.  It's probably not.  It's probably not bad.  Sunburn.  Oh, boy.  Wow, that is real.  Oh, no.  Sam, please, just...  It's horrible, dude.  What does it smell like?  Are you sweaty?  It smells like, you know, dirty, greasy hair. 
[02:31:30]  Vinnie Brand made me smell the inside of his watch band one time.  Watch band.  It would never have occurred to me, he goes, there's smallness.  And I was like, oh.  Bad.  Watch band, yeah, because you don't think that your wrist is going to sweat, but it does.  You've got to throw the hat in the washer every so often.  Rotate them around.  Yeah.  So, like, three hats, and then one goes in the washer.  Rotation.  Comes out.  Worsh that shit.  Yeah.  Take it off on the street.  I place it in the washer.  You wear a hat a lot, though.  It is kind of difficult to...  Yeah.  Hat smell.  Oh, smelly cat. 
[02:32:00]  How about, what does E-Rock need him to get?  Oh, right.  The Oreos with the Reese's.  I sent the other intern down.  Oh, you did?  The girl?  So we can have a live...  What's her name?  The consumer.  This is Carrie Ann.  Carrie Ann, okay.  Thank you.  Carrie Ann!  Isn't that a song?  My baby!  Baby Carrie.  How's it going?  I have no idea, but I know it's a song, right?  Or is it someone else, Ann?  Whatever.  Is Bob Kelly Boston?  Carrie Ann, by the way.  No, Bob is great.  Okay. 
[02:32:30]  Wait, you work with Bob Kelly?  Yeah.  I used to say he's helping him with his podcast, and Bobby's strong on the ropes.  I didn't feel like close enough.  Yeah, like, dude, you got to get early.  I hope Bobby really scolds you.  Oh, does he?  Yeah.  He's been cool with me so far.  He's a right-on-time kind of guy, right?  Bob's a tyrant.  He scolds a lot of other people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He gets pissed.  Yeah.  But he's been cool with me.  He does a good live show, though.  He's taping a special...  Bob, sorry to interrupt you.  He's taping a special...  I think tickets are sold out, though.  It's this, and the Village Underground, this coming Tuesday.  He rolls with an iron hoof. 
[02:33:00]  Bobby sits on an iron fist.  Good for Bobby.  Taping a little special.  Yeah, yeah.  He's doing it in the Village Underground.  He wants that club feel, which will be great.  Yeah.  Of course.  All right.  We're done with you, brother.  That was great.  Really amazing stuff.  Thank you.  We already have a Stinky, so we can't change the name.  Yes, yes.  Amazing.  Very good.  Really good.  How was that hat?  It was bad.  Very hot.  It was very bad, yeah.  Okay.  Dave Chappelle was on Letterman. 
[02:33:30]  Yes.  Oh, I want to find out about this.  And he's finally talking.  Talking, talking, talking.  Yep.  Chappelle says his show wasn't canceled.  Did anyone think it was?  No, he left it.  No one really cares at this point.  That happened so long ago.  Dang it.  A long time ago.  But he stepped down when he was fucking huge.  On top.  That show.  We forget how big that show was, right?  And he was negotiating a new deal, and they were ready to fucking open the vault for this  guy.  And he just said, I'm out of here. 
[02:34:00]  Yep.  God damn it.  He left.  You had the Dave Chappelle show at Comedy Central, and then you didn't have the Dave Chappelle  show at Comedy Central.  And in comedy, the reason most people have a show and then don't have a show is because  they say, well, we don't want you to have a show anymore.  But that wasn't the case here.  The case here was you said, I guess you said, I don't want your show anymore, and you took  a hike.  It's worse than that. 
[02:34:30]  It's worse.  Yeah.  But now are you tired of talking about it?  It's 10 years.  I don't talk about it.  It's like, you know, I just, you know, listen, here it is.  Technically, I never quit.  I'm seven years late for work.  Well, that's five years.  Jesus.  Boy, are you going to be in trouble when you go back? 
[02:35:00]  Well, you know, no, it's like getting divorced in the 50s.  People ain't go to divorce court.  They just look at their wife like, baby, I'm going to get a pack of cigarettes.  I'll be right back.  This is probably fucking funny, man.  All right.  There you go.  That's all.  That's all he had.  That's it?  No.  But he had more about it.  Nope.  But this was the big exclusive.  That was it.  Oh, well, that wasn't much.  He said he did not.  Oh, there's more.  I know he said that they had filmed sketches in season three, and they weren't. 
[02:35:30]  But something happened then.  And I know, I remember in the time, I believe he said something like, if you guys show these,  I won't come back.  And then he wasn't coming back, so they showed them.  I don't remember the details.  Yeah, they had a couple of the guys.  I forgot who it was.  Donnell Rawlins, probably Charlie Murphy.  Yeah, yeah, they would come out and intro some of these bits.  I wish we had more.  I bet there's more.  Yeah.  You look like there's more. 
[02:36:00]  Let's just say I'm you, and ten years ago, I don't one day go to work.  Oh, you just stopped coming.  I stopped coming to work.  And that's what you did.  Am I right about that?  Yeah.  Okay, and you went to South Africa.  Am I right about that?  Yeah, yeah.  And you lived in South Africa for an extended period of time?  Well, no.  I was there for two weeks.  I mean, you know what I mean?  There's not too many good hiding places left in America. 
[02:36:30]  Am I right about this?  There was great mystery about this strategy on your part.  Was there not?  I, you know, I don't know.  Because when it was all over the media, I was gone.  And then if you're the guy, nobody really says anything to you.  Right.  So I don't know if it was mysterious or not mysterious.  It was like living in the corner of perception reality.  You know what I mean?  And like, it's a weird place to be. 
[02:37:00]  When everyone thought Wesley Snipes was in jail, I saw him at a party.  I, uh...  That's right.  He's a weird dude.  What is he about?  He's not really saying exactly what was your motive for leaving.  What?  Yeah.  Because there was speculation.  And again, it was pure speculation that, like, you know, he had spoken to Farrakhan.  Or it said, like, look what you're doing.  And, like, look at the material.  But again, that could be total nonsense.  Oh, kind of like you're acting the fool. 
[02:37:30]  But I don't even, you know, again, that was just people talking.  It could be completely false.  I actually saw Dave Chappelle on Letterman.  Came into the city as a Long Islander for a Letterman taping.  Letterman taping.  And he was the comedian.  He was, like, 17 at the time.  Yeah, I am.  And just killed it, I remember.  And I was like, wow, who is this fucking guy?  I am.  But there's something going on in his head.  What is it?  I don't know.  He was a young guy when he started.  Real young guy.  And he got very famous pretty fast. 
[02:38:00]  But he was funny.  He was, like, legitimately funny.  He wasn't a guy that they pushed through.  Like, he was completely different than what was in the mainstream.  Sure.  Just his delivery and his, you know, hey, man.  He's got that mellow vibe.  And he's a tremendous ability on stage where he could talk about almost anything.  And you just focus on him and listen to him.  And he lulls you.  But not in a boring way.  In a fascinating way.  He's a really, you know, as a comic I watch, and we're like, this guy is just an amazing presence. 
[02:38:30]  And a great comic.  So I think that kind of, when you go through the roof that fast, it's got to put the fucking whammy on you in some way.  Like, one day you're just dreaming about doing what you're doing, and you're in Washington, D.C.  And a few years later, you're like, you're almost this iconic name in comedy.  That's kind of what you were gunning for, maybe.  Yeah, but it's a big one when you get it.  Like, Justin Bieber is kind of growing up in front of everyone and making mistakes. 
[02:39:00]  You know, and Chappelle was, you know, again, when most teenagers are just doing what they're doing privately, he's kind of on stage doing it.  Right.  So maybe that kind of...  Why don't you just talk about it?  It's so weird.  I don't know.  Do you regret saying, I don't want this enormous sum of money?  Well, okay, look.  Dave.  It's very hard to go to something like this because no one's really done it before.  So there's not too many people that don't think I'm crazy, right?  So I look at it like this.  I'm at a restaurant with my wife. 
[02:39:30]  It's a nice restaurant.  We're eating dinner.  I look across the room.  I say, you see this guy over here across the room?  He has $100 million.  And we're eating the same entree.  So, okay, fine.  I don't have $50 million or whatever it was.  But say I have $10 million in the bank.  The difference in lifestyle is minuscule.  So, the only difference between having $10 million and $50 million is an astounding $40 million. 
[02:40:00]  But he's still avoiding...  Why didn't you just say why he walked away?  It's been so long.  He's not saying anything here.  He's making some fucking funny jokes.  When you quit, like, my friends will try to make me feel better.  But no one's been through that.  So they'll say stupid.  Not stupid stuff.  It's nice.  But they'll be like, wait, no, Dave. 
[02:40:30]  At the end of the day, you still have your integrity.  That's great.  I'll go home and make the kids some integrity sandwiches.  It makes no sense at all.  It's like there's nothing anyone can say.  It's just you do what you feel like you need to do.  Right.  Well, okay.  Well, there you go.  That's the answer.  And how do you feel with doing what you felt you needed to do?  It's a very complicated answer.  Because I've felt a variety of ways in the last 10 years.  You know, whenever there's something that I'd like to have that I could have afforded that I can't now afford, well, then I'm upset about it. 
[02:41:00]  But then when I see a guy going to a job that's time consuming and he doesn't have the free time to do the things that I get to do, then I'd feel good about it.  But overall, in your heart, in everyone's heart, we know money is not the answer or the solution.  Money is the fuel for choices.  Money gives me choices.  So that's not nothing. 
[02:41:30]  It's something.  I can choose when I want my kids to go to school.  I can choose what I want to eat in a given day.  It's not the end.  But it's not the end all be all.  There are other things in my life that I did not purchase with money that are very valuable.  That's right.  And let's just say you had the $40 million.  Who's to say you would be a happier or better person?  I think I might be a happier person. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  But he's really not addressing the reason why he left.  It's the first time I've really heard.  Yes.  That's his opinion.  He's not giving the real reason.  It just.  And he's coming.  Dave can go out and make money whenever he wants.  I mean, he's doing like four or five nights in Radio City.  But $40 million.  That's a lot of money.  He could make millions on the road, though.  Chappelle can go out and make millions of fucking dollars if he really wants to.  You know, he still sells tremendous money.  He could still make a shitload of money.  I think he's got like four or five sold-out nights in Radio City.  I mean, he's just amazing. 
[02:42:30]  That's got to be, what, five grand right there.  But that's per show.  So you figure he's going to pull in 25 Gs for the week.  Oh, man.  I wonder what it was.  Perhaps.  Why did he leave?  What I heard way back when, and this might be nonsense, was that he was doing a slave,  and again, pure speculation of what I've heard.  He's doing, there was a slavery bit or something, and he saw one of the, like, the white writers 
[02:43:00]  laughing at this slave bit or this slave thing, and it just, he just felt wrong about it.  It just, maybe he felt like he was clowning or whatever.  I mean, again, I'm getting inside his head, and I'm not qualified.  That was just what I heard at the time.  And then that just kind of sent him, like, what am I doing?  But that could have just been a story somebody thought of and made up.  My God, those are slaves over there.  That was when they went in the time machine, and they went back, and fucking Charlie Murphy  is looking at him from the field like he's going to kill him. 
[02:43:30]  But couldn't he have just said, all right, look, we're not doing this fucking bit after  he had that realization on the spot?  I'm guessing at that point, he had the power to go, you know what, I don't feel right about  this now.  I remember going to Comedy Central with Colin, or to meet Colin at his office at Comedy Central  with a tough crowd, and we saw Chappelle, and he was getting into the elevator.  And he's like, yeah, I'm doing this new sketch thing, you know, and it's like, man, it just  overshadowed fucking everything on the network.  It was, Tosh, I don't know if Tosh is bigger now. 
[02:44:00]  He might be.  I don't think so.  Tosh is pretty fucking big, though.  Yeah, Tosh is huge on there.  Every night he's on.  He's on.  But Chappelle, then again, Chappelle only did two seasons and left, and that.  And they're not giving Chappelle 50, I mean, Tosh 50 million bucks.  And there were less choices back when Chappelle was on.  Yeah.  So he had a lot more eyes on it.  He, I still remember that first sketch we watched at the Comedy Cellar, the black guy who  became a Klansman or whatever, and it just, you just remember it.  That closing things be.  Yeah. 
[02:44:30]  Well, this guy in Cleveland knows why, so let's say hi to David.  David, David knows why.  Go ahead.  It's well known in the black community that Dave Chappelle left the Chappelle show, not  only because, you know, he was making fun of his culture, but he just felt like he was  exploiting it.  I mean, it's the same thing as watching boondocks with your white friends.  I mean, some of the jokes are funny, but then again, you've got to think twice, like,  how funny are they taking them?  So that's my opinion on it.  So, yeah, he just, he probably didn't feel good about it, right?  Exactly.  It kind of hurt a little bit to, you know, exploit his culture like that. 
[02:45:00]  I mean, it was almost ridiculous to a point.  I can remember being 15 years old watching like, damn, that's kind of fucked up.  But it sold.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  Well, hey, thanks, guys.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, David.  Come on, the play of haters' ball.  Shit's fucking hilarious.  The goddamn race draft.  Fuck your couch.  Great.  Exactly.  But if he wanted to do that show, I mean, I don't think they would fire Tosh for him, 
[02:45:30]  but he could still come back and probably do that show on HBO or anywhere he wanted.  He obviously is not going to do that show anymore.  I mean, a sketch show, like whatever David wanted.  He obviously doesn't want to do the sketch show anymore.  Hmm.  I don't know.  That was some funny shit.  It sure was.  Letterman's a good interview, though.  I mean, he's trying to take every angle he can to get the answer, you know?  I don't get the thinking that deeply into, uh...  You're thinking that deeply into it. 
[02:46:00]  You're doing a show.  Do the fucking show.  It's making people laugh.  It's successful.  There.  Oh, I feel that I'm exploiting a certain...  Come on.  Privilege talking.  Go home.  Is that my privilege talking?  Yeah.  That's right, Sam.  I love my fucking privilege.  But what about the other side of it, where, you know, his people, let's just say, they  were watching it in droves.  Oh, yeah.  So they didn't have a problem with it.  Black dudes love that show.  They thought it was great.  But he could have always changed direction, too, I think.  Sure he could have.  He could have switched direction a little bit, or... 
[02:46:30]  Right.  You know, again, when you're Chappelle, you can do what you want.  Yeah, they would have listened to him at Comedy Central at the time.  Yeah, he was by far the biggest guy.  I mean, Jon Stewart was very powerful, but Dave is, you know, that show was a fucking  massive man.  Yeah, he may not have been ready to have the biggest TV show ever with his name plastered  on it.  Yeah.  That freaks people out.  He said I heard what he...  He's still in the show.  You'll never know that.  That's right.  I couldn't handle it.  When he does shows now, they'll still yell, like, Rick James... 
[02:47:00]  Like, back then, he'd literally walk on stage, and they would just start doing,  like...  Coming at darkness?  Yeah, Rick James, just yelling nonsense.  And he's a mellow comic.  He's not a fucking...  Screamer.  Yeah, fuck...  Fuck your couch!  Fuck your couch!  Fuck your couch!  God damn, was that fucking one of the funniest bits I've ever seen on television at all.  He...  That show was...  The James thing.  That show was so big, he made Lil Jon.  Like, everybody going, what? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  Everybody's impression of Lil Jon is Dave Chappelle's impression of Lil Jon.  John Mayer was on that show?  Yeah, yeah.  What?  What did the hand say to the face?  Slap!  Slap!  Darkness, come here, Darkness!  You ever see I'm Rick James, bitch?  Oh, Christ!  Thanks.  One, two, three, and to the four. 
[02:48:00]  Snoop Doggy Doggy, Dr. Dre is at the door.  Ready to make an entrance, so back on up.  Cause you knew about to rip shit up.  Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble.  Hopping in Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble.  Ain't nothing.  Nice.  Nice.  Boom.  Give me, um, the show's coming back.  Give me, um, give me these fucking things. 
[02:48:30]  The show's coming back.  Perfection is perfect.  Show's coming back.  From my young G.  From my young G.  G, dang.  Hey, I'm smoking weed.  Yeah, why we got that today there, E-Rock?  Any reason?  Just cause it's an awesome song.  Nice.  Oh, is it?  Uh, where are we at with the Oreos?  We're waiting on them.  Oh, boy.  First place didn't have them, so they ran to another place.  All right.  You might do a live, uh, the consumer today. 
[02:49:00]  What?  There is a substitution for the Oreos if need be.  What is that?  Uh, new, new, new types of Cheez-Its.  Thanks.  New, new types of Cheez-Its?  Yeah, there's new types of Cheez-Its.  Just a bam, bam.  Uh, someone sent me a, uh, little, uh, clip from the Joe Rogan experience.  Oh, yeah.  Where, uh, let's see here.  Where was I?  God damn it.  Um, where Neil Brennan, who, who, uh, co-founded, co-co-what?  Co-produced? 
[02:49:30]  Co-creator.  He was the co-creator.  And he was a great writer on it, too.  Um, he discusses why the Chappelle show went off the air.  Mm-hmm.  And supposedly, Dave Chappelle and Neil Brennan don't get along that well these days.  Oh, really?  And they were really tight and really close.  Yeah, I've heard they do talk, though.  Like, uh, Neil had told me, like, that they've spoken.  You know, I think, you know, in time, things kind of...  Go to, uh, Pretty Plus More on Twitter.  Is this it?  She just tweeted it.  Yeah, that's it.  I would write it on the Chappelle show.  I would, you know what I mean? 
[02:50:00]  Like, I would...  Wasn't that an issue on the Chappelle show with Comedy Central?  No.  I mean, I mean, that was...  No.  I'd heard that you guys were supposed to...  I know you did.  Yeah.  You know where you heard it?  Where?  From Dave's press junkets.  So it's not true?  No.  Whoa.  We were the golden geese of Comedy Central.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We were a license to print money for them.  So when Dave was saying that they were telling him to stop saying nigger, that was bullshit?  Absolutely.  Wow.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I mean, again, in my experience, that was...  I'm not going to say...  Here's the thing.  I say one thing about Dave and he can go on Oprah and fucking trash me. 
[02:50:30]  So, like, I got to be careful.  But that wasn't my experience at all.  Why would he go on Oprah and trash you?  Is he trashed you?  He has, yeah.  What happened?  You guys had this...  Well, he...  You know, we were doing the show.  Popular show.  You've been on it a few times.  Did wonders for your career.  And then we were doing great.  And then we renewed our contracts, which was extremely ugly.  Comedy Central played Divide and Conquer between us, which I said they're going to do this because 
[02:51:00]  they are going to make...  They're going to...  They have to pay you.  They don't want to have to pay me.  The only way they're going to have to pay me is if you demand that they pay me.  So what they did is they poisoned me within Dave's mind.  And how did they do this?  What did they say?  Like, David said one time at wraparounds that he couldn't do the show without me.  During a taping, he said that.  And I said that to Comedy Central. 
[02:51:30]  I was like, hey, just so you know, Dave said he couldn't do the show without me.  And so they called in and go, you know, Neil says you can't do the show without him.  And then he's like, I'm a motherfucker.  So it just becomes an ego thing.  But wait a minute.  You guys didn't have the kind of relationship where he would call you up?  We did prior to that.  But once the negotiation started, then it became like, I can't talk to anybody.  You know?  Really?  Yeah.  It was the...  Let me be clear with this.  It was the worst period of my life.  I can't imagine a worst period.  And it's just because the stakes were so high and the money was so high? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, it just became an ego thing and it just became like...  No, I can attest to what the scene on the set was when we did the Fear Factor spoof.  And what it was was Neil was running everything and Dave was in character all day running around, you know, I'm Rick James, bitch!  I think that's an exaggeration.  Joe Rogan!  Joe Rogan!  But, you know, I mean, you had a huge part in that show.  Yeah, I was the co-creator of the show.  Like, it wasn't... 
[02:52:30]  That's the thing is like...  But I think what happened was, you know, they made it seem like by Dave admitting that I was...  Lorne Michaels once said, in reference to me and Dave, comedians don't like it when people realize they have help.  And I think in...  And Dave was the one who would say that I was...  Because it was fair.  Because it was only fair of...  He would have to say, Neil makes a big contribution to the show because I did.  It was conversations would come out of shit.  We said whatever. 
[02:53:00]  But again, I contributed, I believe I held up my end of the bargain.  But it just became this thing of like, they made...  I think...  I don't think they made, I think part of it was in him anyway, that he just resented the idea of being on a team.  Really?  Yeah.  And where did you draw this conclusion from?  Did you have a conversation with him about this?  Yeah.  Or did you just...  Yeah?  Yeah.  And what did he say?  We're not a fucking team.  Whoa. 
[02:53:30]  Whoa.  That was after two years of the show.  And we were teams, we were a team when it wasn't popular.  God damn, that sucks.  Yeah.  No, it was really painful.  I know, that's the thing.  It's like, look, me and Dave are cool now.  And I don't think that that's...  I'd like to think that this was all circumstantial.  You know what I mean?  Like, in the circumstance, he was just under a lot of pressure.  And he felt like...  You know, the other thing that...  What you're saying is he cracked.  I don't know.  You know, the other thing that I will say is that... 
[02:54:00]  Is that in the...  When me and Dave wrote Half Baked, I knew that people in comedy would all think...  Would think that he wrote all of it.  And people in show business would think that I wrote all of it.  Because people in show business are predisposed to think that the black guy is a dummy.  And all that shit.  Dude, I would say to people, I swear to God, I was in a meeting with a producer, and I promise  you, he goes, seriously, how much of that script did Dave write?  I promise. 
[02:54:30]  And I was like, half of it, man.  Half of it.  And sure enough, everyone in comedy thought Dave wrote it.  Jeff Ross referred to me as Dave Chappelle's typist.  Okay?  That's Jeff Ross, though.  I mean, he's the Rose Master General.  But that's a little bit beyond hell.  It wasn't that a rose.  That's a little rude.  Especially if the guy doesn't update his act very often.  That's a little rude.  I didn't buy himself.  Good for you, Joe.  Good for you.  Jeff, if any of your writers are listening.  When I was younger, I would have most certainly had a problem with working with a guy and then 
[02:55:00]  having to reveal the fact this guy was writing half of my material.  Right.  Again, but the idea of half...  It's not...  There's so much work on doing a TV show.  It's just...  It's a lot...  I did a lot of work.  Here's the other thing.  Dave did a fuckload of work, too.  And Dave is a Hall of Fame one-in-a-billion comedian.  I don't know if he'll do that.  Like, one-in-a-billion.  There's, like, Eddie Murphy, him, Chris, in terms of, like...  I know.  I forgot Pryor.  I think he's very different than Eddie Murphy. 
[02:55:30]  I think...  No, no.  But I'm saying in terms of the decathlon of ability, Dave can do stand-up.  He can write sketches.  He can...  Wow.  There you go.  A little taste from the Joe Rogan experience.  Pretty interesting.  Yeah.  Wow, there was some bad blood going on there for a little while.  That should be said, that's from, like...  2011.  Yeah, three years ago.  Yeah.  You know, things might be even more different between those two now.  Yeah.  Neil's doing well.  He's got this show he's doing on...  What the fuck's the...  The channel, uh... 
[02:56:00]  I don't know if it's not IFC...  Fuck.  I can't remember, but he's got, like, a thing that he's hosting.  Right.  Okay.  I'm so pissed I can't remember.  Sundance.  Sundance channel.  Yeah.  Sundance.  Yeah.  Let's go to Zach in New Hampshire.  Zach.  Yeah, how's it going?  Hey.  I worked with a couple of guys in D.C. of color, and we were sitting down talking one  day, and they actually brought this up, and I was kind of floored by the comments that  were made, they had said that the reason that Dave Chappelle quit and ran away was because 
[02:56:30]  of the pressure from the Freemasons.  Now, I thought they were fucking with me, and I listened, and they were serious as a  heart attack.  They actually went on to say that the Freemasons were the reason that Martin Lawrence ran through  the street naked.  They were chasing him because they would not come on board and give money to the Freemasons,  and since his name's been in the news, that Tracy Morgan actually is in with the Freemasons,  and that's why he's so popular.  Oh, what nonsense. 
[02:57:00]  What nonsense.  Almost fell over.  What utter nonsense.  I'm not saying you're lying.  I'm saying that for them saying that.  Just shit.  It's a hell of a conspiracy theory.  I mean, and again, I thought they were messing with me, but they were, they couldn't have been  any more serious about the situation.  Yeah.  But hey, guys, I appreciate getting on, best skit in the world, 100 grand back in mass,  baby.  Oh, yeah.  What happened?  Hey, he was just complimenting a bit.  Oh, the 100 grand back?  Back in the day. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  And, well, I guess it's being said now that Jimmy's a Freemason, so of course he'll cover  it up.  Yes, exactly.  Yeah, but I forgot that, I'm thinking of something.  Oh, boy.  Freemasons make a lot of money.  I couldn't think.  Yeah, that's a hard one, Chip.  Freemason, was he in jail or something?  Go ahead, Sam.  There you go.  You got it.  So that's that, then.  The Dave Chappelle stuff.  Yeah.  Still kind of a mystery.  Still a mystery.  Bit of a mystery still.  Ooh. 
[02:58:00]  The hell happened.  I think he just cracked.  Yeah, I think he went crazy.  Whether it was the pressure or some kind of, maybe he had some kind of mental thing already.  I don't know.  Something seemed to just snap.  If he would have come back in a month or whatever, he's like Colonel Kurtz.  Basically, if he would have just come home, they would have just forgot the whole goddamn  thing.  The whole goddamn thing.  Yeah.  Right.  Louis was smart.  Louis took a year off, and maybe that was what he needed with that show.  When you're hitting such a tremendous stride, hitting such massive fame, and then you just 
[02:58:30]  go, you know what?  I'm going to step back and make sure I don't ruin this and write it smart.  Yeah.  And then people are there for you.  No one noticed it.  People are like, where's Louis?  Oh, he's coming back.  And the way TV is now, everything is weird, cycles, and all of a sudden, it's like, oh,  yeah, he's back.  Okay.  Right.  You don't look at it like, it doesn't feel like over a year.  Oh, it doesn't feel like you took a year off.  Last night's episode was really good.  The 90-minute episode.  What?  I haven't seen that one.  The weed episode.  I got to see that one.  A lot of weed in last night's Louis episode. 
[02:59:00]  Louis is a young kid.  Anyway.  Oh, right.  That one, yeah.  Yeah.  That was the last one.  Yeah, I haven't seen that one yet.  What are these snacks?  Snickety Snacks.  The consumer's holding up everything.  Yeah, he is.  No, the stores don't have the Oreos.  Oh, the consumer.  What a hunk of shite.  Well, where are you going to get yours?  I already have them at home.  Oh.  But where did you get yours?  From other stores.  What a crud.  You sound so angry.  The stores.  And what are those? 
[02:59:30]  Cheese It's?  I love fucking Cheese It's.  I hate a Cheese It.  You don't like a Cheese It?  No.  What's wrong with you?  Jesus.  Really?  I just clicked on something.  Sure you did.  I swear to God.  There might be an animation to an E-Rock song.  Oh.  That I just discovered.  Are you going to come in and eat your Cheese It's and give them a review?  Sure.  I love a good Cheese It's.  Yeah, but Cheese It's aren't as good as the Oreos with the Reese's.  Well, there's Cheese It zings. 
[03:00:00]  What's the Cheese It zings?  That's when it zings a zong.  And then you got the Zesty Cheddar Cheese It Grooves.  Ow.  Ow.  Don't eat that.  Hey, E-Rock.  Something to go back and listen to.  No, no, no.  It was not bad.  Oh, no.  It was a terrible joke.  Cheese It Grooves?  What about the grooves?  What are they?  What's the big deal with the grooves? 
[03:00:30]  It's probably if you dip it in something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Is that what they're trying to say?  Yeah.  So you get more of the dip on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the thought.  You're in a peep booth.  Oh, God.  You really want to pile it on?  All right.  Can't you just figure out that on your own without having to have grooves to make it easier?  Yeah.  How easy do you need it?  I bet the...  As easy as possible.  Well, you are the consumer.  I understand.  It's grooved like a washboard. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  They hold a lot of dip.  Well, normally, Cheez-Its aren't usually meant to go into dip.  They're not designed that way.  Well, open them already.  Stop staring at the box.  Somebody wants some Cheez-Its.  Yes, I do.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Have you taken a photo?  I have photos on my phone.  You already have photos of the Cheez-Its?  I do.  Of course you do.  You just walk around with photos of Cheez-Its in your phone.  That's like what he has in lieu of nude girl pictures.  Oh, look at that.  Cheez-Its.  Yeah, I love these. 
[03:01:30]  Look at my cheeseburger soup.  He's got them.  Sam Canberra.  He's sending cockpicks to Nestle.  Yeah, he loves when the fucking chocolate fortune cookies mount the white cheddar.  Now, the problem with Cheez-Its is that they usually taste burnt.  Right.  Oh, really?  Nabisco's cheese nips are much better.  Oh.  But.  Oh, right.  But that's racist.  Cheez-Its has been doing something kind of cool where they've been changing some of the flavors. 
[03:02:00]  They make a Tabasco one that actually is very good.  Wow.  That sounds like it would be good.  Yeah.  What about, they should use Frank's, though.  Frank's over Tabasco, right?  A lot of people don't use Frank's Red Hot.  They, because.  What do you mean?  I don't know if they license well or whatever, but everybody uses Tabasco.  Tabasco's too hot.  Tabasco's more than a cooking sauce, though.  Plus, it's also a name like Xerox, so everybody recognizes what Tabasco is.  Tabasco, though, one drop and your fucking mouth's on fire.  They're good.  But Frank's, you could kind of like, you know, really dump it on there.  So, Cheez-Its has four new flavors in this Grooves line, or Zings line. 
[03:02:30]  Whatever they're doing here.  The Zings and Grooves.  Two out of the four that we have are Chipotle Cheddar and Zesty Cheddar Ranch, which is  the one we have open right now.  They're a bit bigger than normal Cheez-Its.  Oh.  And they're a different texture.  Ooh, HD.  Oh, yeah.  I'm getting a good...  So, you're making a good...  This would be a good video if someone decided to hit record. 
[03:03:00]  So, you're doing it perfect.  So, these don't look like normal Cheez-Its.  They're actually brighter in color.  And the box does smell really good.  It smells almost like...  Cheese?  No.  The Zesty Cheddar Ranch.  It smells almost like...  Ranch.  Yeah, but a certain kind of ranch, because not all ranch is the same.  Zesty Cheddar.  How do you know they're not...  How do you know that not all ranches are the same?  They're not.  They're not.  I've tried many, and they all vary. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, no.  This smells like if you're going to make, like, a vegetable ranch dip, but before you  put it into the sour cream.  Like, it's just the spices from the powder and stuff, yeah.  Oh, the taste.  There it is.  I feel very special today.  I know.  Got the consumer right here.  He's doing his thing.  This is famous.  Lime is in studio instead of just on Instagram.  Oh, boy.  He needed two tastes.  He's taking a few bites here.  Uh-huh.  Let him take his time. 
[03:04:00]  Did he clean off your palate properly?  I did.  Okay.  And I brushed away water.  A nice flavored water.  Yes.  Gasoline and jizz.  He's not ready to say anything yet.  Stop breaking my treats.  Oh, he broke your treats.  He's not ready to say anything.  You have to have another one, just to make sure.  All right.  He's popping another in his mouth there.  James would like some.  Just a couple.  At least smell the box.  It's amazing.  I always do. 
[03:04:30]  He does.  Smell the box.  Let me smell the box.  Oh, no, thank you.  I'll smell the box.  I'm good.  You just pass it along.  All right.  Please.  I'll smell the box.  I'm not bad.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That's a spicy kind of thing going on there.  There's a lot going on there.  I thought you poked.  Oh, yeah.  That smells pretty good.  I'd probably have a few of those.  Yes.  Don't feel like having them.  That's exactly what it is, though.  You can only eat a few of these.  These are fucking great.  It's not like a potato chip, where you can sit there and eat, or a nice bag of pretzels, 
[03:05:00]  where you can just sit there.  Not notice how many have gone as the time passes.  Just eat them all.  Jesus.  I got you.  You can only do...  What's your favorite potato chip?  The people want to know.  Well, it's a...  Hmm.  Well, Lay's original potato chips are very good.  They're very greasy, but they're very good.  You don't like a little flavor, a little salt and vinegar, or any of that chip?  I love salt and vinegar.  That's the problem.  There's...  Cape Cod makes a nice kettle chip.  Nice. 
[03:05:30]  That is salt and vinegar.  Yes, they do.  Which is delicious.  I actually like that one a lot.  They also have a nice sea salt and pepper.  Right.  Would you enjoy those with a cheeseburger?  No, you can eat those by yourself.  I mean, would you like them?  With a cheeseburger, you'd have regular chips, would it?  Salt and vinegar would take away.  What would you have with the Cheez-Its you're having right now?  Well, a ham.  I would pair it with a...  Maybe a nice Belgian ale.  Really?  This is something that you would have probably with, like, a Blue Moon or a Whole Garden. 
[03:06:00]  You didn't hear him say hand-pair.  What is that?  He's hand-pairing it.  What does that even mean?  Exactly.  Suggested drink with the meal.  Oh, oh, right.  It's not a meal.  It's a snack.  It's a snack.  All right, you ready for the review?  No meal for me.  They are better than regular Cheez-Its, but the ranch flavoring is very good.  The cracker itself, the flavoring is not really baked into it. 
[03:06:30]  It's on it.  Oh.  So it disappears real quick.  Gotcha.  So you're tasting blandness as soon as the ranch disappears.  Right.  You want goodness all the way through.  Right.  You want it baked into that.  But you're just chewing it and swallowing.  You're not sucking it like a fucking lollipop.  Well, then what's the point of reviewing it?  I hear what he says.  That's not baked in.  You want your shit baked in, right?  Right.  Okay.  It's like when you have...  We're learning here.  I mentioned he likes a good garlic knot.  Oh, yeah.  And there's a lot of places that can really fuck up a garlic knot because after the fact, 
[03:07:00]  they just paint a little garlic on it and then it's done.  It's like bread with the garlic thing.  It's not infused.  You've got to infuse that shit.  Oh, yeah.  Take the dough.  And this is where the garlic butter saw comes in.  You mix the dough into it.  Let it sit in there for a while.  Then you make the knot and you bake it.  Oh, man.  So it's all the way through it.  All right.  So...  A little fat guy tip for you.  Oh.  Do you have a rating scale as the consumer?  No, I just tell you if I like it or not and if it's worth your time. 
[03:07:30]  Do you like it?  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  Yeah, you're continuing to eat that.  I did enjoy them.  I had a few.  They're good.  Yeah.  All right.  Now move on to the next one.  That's my review.  The other one here is chipotle cheddar.  What's that?  And it's a different shape.  Jeez, it's...  Those are the grooves.  Those are the zings.  Right.  Wait.  He tried the grooves.  Now he's trying the zings.  Everything's chipotle now.  Yeah.  Chipotle.  Oh, it's going to zing a zong.  Everything was what before that? 
[03:08:00]  Before that, everything was pomegranate.  Really?  Yeah.  Every time they discover a new flavor, then everything has to have that flavor in it.  Yeah.  What about the acai berry?  That's an everything.  That was before that.  Oh, wow.  Behind.  The acai berry.  All right.  Oh, it's going to be a good sniff.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  There's no scent from the box.  None.  None.  It's usually a good thing.  I bet it's going to be...  Is that a bad sign?  All right.  That just smells like a fucking cardboard.  It's not going to get much flavor.  It's a cardboard.  Right?  All right.  So these are a different consistency. 
[03:08:30]  They're the Cheez-It zings, right?  Right.  They look like a flattened-out Cheez-It with a...  They make little ridges at the end, not grooves that you would use for the dip.  Hmm.  Let's see how this tastes here.  There he goes.  Popped it right in his mouth.  I don't like these at all.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Negative review.  I'm not trying to be difficult.  I really wanted to like this, but...  Oh, you wanted to like this.  Wow.  The chipotle flavoring is...  That's my favorite. 
[03:09:00]  I don't know.  It's just, like, spicy for the sake of being spicy.  Uh-huh.  Without really enjoying the fact that it's spicy.  Yeah.  So, it's just...  This seems like a big waste.  Jim, what do you think?  Fucking love it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do you really?  Mm-hmm.  Is it just bland?  E-Rock's a tougher palate than I am, though.  Well, it's not bland.  It's just...  It's overly spicy, but you're not really enjoying it.  It's just like, hey, throw a bunch of spicy.  Oh, okay.  I call it Chipotle.  Gotcha.  And then eat it.  And then if you do actually get a bad aftertaste with it, like, it's still spicy even though 
[03:09:30]  you've finished eating.  Mm-hmm.  That's not good.  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  I would have this with a darker beer.  Oh, would you?  Yeah.  Like?  Something a bit more hoppy.  Yeah?  Kangaroo?  Somewhere between that and a stout.  Kind of a stout?  Yeah.  All right.  It's E-Rock Radio on Instagram.  And Twitter.  And Twitter.  Hashtag the consumer. 
[03:10:00]  He's trying shit every day now.  Oh, yeah.  We wanted him to try something else, but...  They didn't have Oreos around.  I know, so we had to go with the cheese.  It's not the greatest thing to try, I would say.  We have Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Oreos and the Banana Split Oreos.  We'll try those.  Can't wait for that.  So how many things are you trying a week?  At least 14, 15?  I'm trying to see if I can do at least two to three a day.  Even if you're sampling, that's a lot of calories.  I want to thank the fine people at Slim Jim, who are now sending me their entire product 
[03:10:30]  line to review.  Hey, all right.  I'm telling you, this is taking off, but you need to make it into a video.  Snap into a Slim Jim.  Who gives a fuck other people making the videos?  You would make it your own.  Right.  And you got the built-in fan base.  That's right.  So make the fucking video.  You did it perfect right there.  Treat boy.  You edit that down quick to a quick 45-second video, you're golden.  You're good.  You're like the Zagat rating of gas station food.  Yeah.  Except you changed the first letter.  All right, let's get out of here. 
[03:11:00]  We fucking...  I love it.  As we stumble to the finish line.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Yes, Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  On, let's see, July 10, 11, and 12, I return to West Palm Beach to the improv  Finally, I haven't been there in five years.  July 24th, I'm in...  I'm sorry, July 26th, Montreal, the Gisu Theater.  August 7, 8, 9, I return to Cobbs in San Francisco.  I haven't been there in a while, either. 
[03:11:30]  Is that in your corn on the...  Dude, you're fucking incorrigible.  Nice.  I think that does it for today.  Yeah.  Tomorrow on the show, Lawrence Fishburne, huh?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Damn.  That is really happening, huh?  That's awesome.  Larry Fishburne.  Kiwi Herman show.  Yes, Cowboy Curtis.  Let's just talk about Cowboy Curtis the whole time.  Just Cowboy Curtis.  How old was you when you did that?  In his 20s.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Holy shit.  It was after Apocalypse. 
[03:12:00]  They were all pretty young.  Bill Hartman was in it, too.  Have you tried...  Someone just...  Tasha Leon was really young.  Yeah.  He was like fucking five years old.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, she was a little kid.  We were talking about Tabasco, and someone on Twitter just sent me a picture of the Tabasco  spicy chocolate.  Have you tried this shit out yet?  No.  That sounds dangerous.  It looks dangerous.  Well, feel free to send it in.  I think that's CarlitosG on Twitter.  Thank you for the picture.  I can't believe they're making that.  That's crazy. 
[03:12:30]  That's why you got a good bit going.  There's so much new shit out there.  Yeah, I found some new stuff.  Even some stuff that the Opster might even like.  Wow.  Like what?  Some weird vegetable chips.  No.  Fuck you.  Weird vegetable chips.  I'm not that bad.  I don't like vegetable chips.  I've tried them, actually.  There's some beet products out there, though.  That's an opportunity for another cum joke right there, still.  What'd you say?  Nothing.  It's like something Opie might even like.  Cum?  You know.  It's too obvious.  Just another cum joke.  Say that again. 
[03:13:00]  Old cum jokes.  What?  Something that even the Opster would like.  Pack of juice!  There you go.  Let's go home.  You know it's going to be a great show when we start with dolphins having sex with fish.  And monkeys masturbating themselves with frogs.  That's how we start the morning.  You know the day is going to go well. 
[03:13:30]  That's the right way to start a day.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  Call up the post show now.  As we go over some of the stuff that went down on today's Opie and Anthony show.  That's the way the show started.  Some lady.  It's come out again.  I talked about this on my Friday show.  That somehow British people are the ones that find the weirdest Americans to document. 
[03:14:00]  All these super strange documentaries about American people all have British voiceover guys.  Which leads me to believe it's a British person making the film.  Last week on Friday we were talking about it.  It was the guy who's in a relationship.  He's 31 years old.  And he's got a quote unquote girlfriend who's in her 90s.  Now the documentary is about a woman who was a dolphin trainer.  And while she was training dolphins decided to start jacking one off. 
[03:14:30]  Because I guess it needed the sweet sweet release.  I don't know but we were watching the video of her.  And it led to watching animals become intimate with other animals.  It was a very weird thing.  But it's 100% right that it does really just cut down to that base level.  It's very easy for women.  Because I mean men aren't terribly far away from chimpanzees or dolphins.  We just want to get off.  And I was thinking I think the reason that animal sex is so quick. 
[03:15:00]  Because they were talking about today.  Nobody it doesn't take a long time to jack off a dolphin.  Because they're not sitting there thinking about all the other things.  They're not thinking about anything else going on in the room.  They're not thinking about their day at work.  They're not thinking about whether or not they're pleasing their partner.  They're not thinking about anything except the physical response to yes I'm being stroked.  So that's why.  I mean if we could all get there.  I'm sure sexuality would be easier and quicker for everybody. 
[03:15:30]  We went from that.  That was the sandwich.  It was dolphin sex on one slice.  And the consumer live in studio eating crackers on another slice.  Everything in the middle.  That was the gold.  So from that gold Sal.  Let's find out what today's line of the day was.  Here comes the light of the day.  Light of the day. 
[03:16:00]  These were sent to us at work.  I'm not a chocolate lover.  I can't imagine.  Oh my.  Ant's getting really good at figuring out where those holes are.  He's getting really good at sneaking those in.  Is he not Sal?  It's just so fucking quick.  It's so quick.  It's so quick.  You don't even see.  You have to sit there.  Stop for a second. 
[03:16:30]  And think.  In order to get his joke.  You can't get his joke faster than he thinks of it.  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  Because that's the beauty is that shock of like.  Holy shit.  He just fucking said that that fast.  Yeah.  And is that.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Let me put that together.  What was I saying before?  I didn't even.  Oh.  And then you laugh and laugh.  Adrian's in here.  Adrian.  You had a big segment on today's show.  Yeah.  It's great.  Real gold.  About not smelling great.  Yeah.  But it seemed like the guys say you're not smelling too bad anymore. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  I mean.  That's good news.  Right?  Yeah.  It was good to have some support of the guys.  Yeah.  Sal.  Were you surprised or disappointed?  Or anything in their reaction to Adrian?  No.  I mean.  E-Rock kind of neutralized the situation early on this morning.  But.  Yeah.  But we were talking about that on the pre-show.  E-Rock's idea of neutralizing odors is to spray humans with Febreze.  Correct Adrian?  Yeah.  It doesn't really work.  No.  I mean.  If Roland or I like fart in the office.  E-Rock is immediately spraying us.  Yeah.  Within seconds.  With Febreze or some other fucking thing you probably shouldn't be breathing in.  Well.  We learned today.  If there's one thing we learned today. 
[03:17:30]  It's that E-Rock is familiar with products.  He knows the air fresheners.  He knows the crackers.  He knows the cookies.  He knows it all.  Okay.  He does.  He's the best.  He.  How much time E-Rock do you spend in supermarkets?  Because you seem to know.  You're just at the top.  I mean.  The minute water treats got into.  Water enhancers.  Right.  Became an in vogue thing.  You were on top of it with a year long supply of them. 
[03:18:00]  Even back at XM.  Yeah.  Do you spend a lot of time in supermarkets?  I try to.  Just lusting.  Is it like an adult bookstore for some people?  Yeah.  It's the same type of experience.  You know.  There's so many things here.  So when.  Do you go with your wife?  When you do the grocery shopping?  I try not to.  Because then I don't buy as much as I normally would.  Oh my god.  So you're embarrassed to go grocery shopping with your wife.  Because you don't want her to see the amount of snacks that you pick up.  I think she's more embarrassed about going shopping with me. 
[03:18:30]  Right.  But you don't want it.  Like it's a secret.  You don't want her to know exactly how many snacks you're picking up.  It doesn't matter at this point.  She sees them when I bring them home.  Do you put them in the kitchen or do you have a secret stash?  No, they're in the kitchen.  Okay.  All right.  They're in the cabinets there.  So do you have a stock cabinet full of stuff that you're like, okay, I got a good week's  worth of consumer reviews here.  Yeah.  You do?  I have a nice little collection to which I've been called a food hoarder.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you throw stuff out after you try it.  Yeah.  I don't eat the entire thing. 
[03:19:00]  But anytime you see a new product, you just buy it?  I have been lately.  But yeah, usually I'll see something.  I'll go, that looks interesting.  I'll try it.  And that's just because you want to keep this hashtag alive.  There's no...  No, I was doing it before that, which led to the, you know, developing the hashtag,  the consumer.  Because there is no...  You haven't figured out any way to monetize this where you could actually pay for the snacks.  No, not yet.  No.  That's step two, though.  It's like what you have...  Sal put it best.  It's the South Park method where it's step one, underpants. 
[03:19:30]  Step two, question mark.  Step three, profit.  Right.  So I've got to figure out step two right in there.  Iraq, what you have with the hashtag, the consumer, is like Facebook.  We don't know what it is yet, okay?  We can't add advertising now.  It has to be cool.  That's what the consumer has going for it.  It's cool.  Do you want people to leave the party early?  I'm going to go public by the end of the year.  That's right.  Selling stock.  That's right.  Become a billionaire.  Yeah.  All because of...  This dumb hashtag. 
[03:20:00]  A hashtag.  Where...  And this is the other thing that nobody...  And it hasn't been brought up on O&A yet.  Opie, Anthony, or Jim, for some reason, are taking you seriously.  Yeah, I don't get that either.  Me neither.  Like, I don't know...  Because I didn't even bring this up to the show.  No.  I was just doing it.  And this is like something where maybe two, three years ago or more, you had done less  than this and gotten just destroyed for it.  Yeah, verbally raped.  Yeah, I would say that's fair.  Now, for some reason, they're taking this thing seriously. 
[03:20:30]  Because I think...  Well, Jim's a little bit more telling, but I think they secretly wish they could try all  these things.  They want the snacks.  Right.  They know better than to do this, but you know... </pre>
