<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts and Jim Norton engaging in crude, comedic banter.  Opie recounted a humorous story about encountering a severely bleeding man, initially omitting the gruesome detail of a bloody leg, which led to much comedic misunderstanding with Anthony.  The discussion transitioned to the desensitization to violence in New York City.  They then covered recent “assaults on the media” – instances of fans disrupting news reports with Opie and Anthony signage, including a Jersey Shore incident caught on video.  A caller brought up Mark Patrick of MLB Network’s seemingly negative comments about the show. The hosts then played and mocked an XM radio commercial featuring Howard Stern, highlighting Stern’s enraged reaction to a listener mentioning it and his subsequent death wish for the caller.

The show moved on to Cousin Brucie’s job loss at WCBS-FM and Chuck Schumer’s attempts to secure him a new radio position, prompting sarcastic commentary from the hosts.  This transitioned into a segment featuring listener-submitted jingles, many vulgar and offensive, which the hosts played and critiqued.  Tom Cruise’s couch-jumping incident and Jim Norton’s upcoming appearance were also briefly mentioned.

The next segment heavily satirized Russell Crowe’s arrest for assaulting a hotel employee.  Initially believing Crowe ripped a landline phone from the wall, a caller identifying as an arresting officer clarified it was a cordless handset.  Clips from Crowe’s apologetic Letterman appearance were played.  The hosts and callers speculated on Crowe’s motives, suggesting infidelity.  This segued into a mocking discussion of Tom Cruise’s Oprah appearance, playing audio clips and focusing on Cruise's declarations of love.  The hosts discussed audience reactions and speculated on his relationship.  A caller shared a story about Cubans using modified cars to reach the US, sparking a discussion of the “wet foot, dry foot” policy.  Various other callers contributed anecdotes.

A significant portion focused on celebrity encounters and fantasies, including sexually explicit conversations about ideal celebrity partners (Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and others).  A caller shared an embarrassing encounter with Tom Cruise.  Another described a scenario where his wife chose Brad Pitt, leading to him “aiming low.” The conversation was highly sexually graphic.  A listener song for Opie and Anthony, by Bruce Kelly, was played and analyzed for homosexual undertones.  Brad Pitt's appearance on Diane Sawyer, discussing ending world poverty, was juxtaposed with the show's earlier sexually charged banter. An audio clip of a physical altercation was played for comedic effect.

The show continued with a discussion about a package from “Dr. Steve,” containing unusual items including potential medication and possibly NXIVM-related materials.  This shifted to a bizarre debate about gravity, with Opie incorrectly stating that planetary gravity increases with distance from the sun.  A caller who had recently completed an astronomy exam corrected him, but the discussion continued with much profanity and tangents, including a humorous segment about a gay pride cruise.  The hosts also discussed the online gaming black market for virtual goods.

The final segment featured callers sharing what they learned that day, including one discovering a movie character was dead the entire time and another learning the words "Angelina" and "gaping."  Tekatan from Cleveland admitted ignorance about gravity. Bob Saget's cancellation was mentioned, and Jimmy, a guest, promoted his stand-up comedy gigs.  The show concluded with an announcement of the podcast's end.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  No, baby.  That's terrible.  We will be at Anthony's show.  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Oh, that's funny.  That's funny.  I'm funny. 
[00:04:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  We look like assholes right now, man.  We look like assholes right now, man.  You have something to say.  I have something to say.  All right.  So let's just talk.  Do you want to kiss me? 
[00:05:00]  Mom!  I'm not going to have to do this now.  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro.  Hey, man.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Right.  Have you spread the virus today?  I guess you haven't because it's too early to be spreading anything yet. 
[00:05:30]  Wow, we got lots to do today.  Oh, wreck of the day.  In a river.  There is a, what, one of those.  Was that a wreck or was that just a flood?  Nah, that looks like one of those flash floods.  They fooled me.  Good morning.  Hello, Anthony.  I caught up with Anthony on the sidewalk this morning.  Yes, we made it in.  Actually, everybody all of a sudden converged on the building all at one time. 
[00:06:00]  Eric, Danny, me, Opie, all at the same time.  Same place on the sidewalk.  That rarely happens.  And that's when we usually start sharing our stories.  Our stories from our couple of blocks walk.  Or the day before.  Whatever.  Well, mine was the guy that I passed by today on my way in.  Some black guy wearing one of those big Jamaican Jiffy Pop hats. 
[00:06:30]  Put their dreads in.  Looks like Jiffy Pop when it's all ready.  And he was across the street.  And I'm waiting across the street.  So he starts coming toward me.  And he's limping real bad.  With this real bad limp.  And when he passes me, of course, I turn around and look to make sure, you know, no shenanigans.  Like he's not just passing me and then turns around and beats me over the head with a cobblestone or something. 
[00:07:00]  So I look.  And the back.  Can I interrupt you for a second?  Uh-huh.  If he did hit you over the head with a cobblestone.  Yeah.  Would you be waking up hearing Christmas music or maybe, I don't know, maybe some Halloween songs?  I don't know.  That's, oof.  That's probably Halloween, like after Christmas.  Like, I'm going two years.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you can't get hit with a cobblestone and just pull out of that one.  And for all the people around America going, man, you guys are paranoid. 
[00:07:30]  No, this happens in New York.  It's New York.  You've got to look out.  Some lady was just minding her own business one day a couple years ago, and she got a brick over the head.  Yeah, a big brick just slammed over her head.  For no reason.  She was just walking down the street.  Homeless guy decided, I'm going to cave her skull in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why not?  So I guess you have that in the back of your mind.  You see a guy limping by with a bloody leg, and you're thinking, all right, maybe something's going on here, and you've got to make sure he's not coming back for you. 
[00:08:00]  I didn't get to the bloody leg part, Opie.  Oh, well.  Hadn't gotten to that part yet.  I'm sorry.  That's news to me.  I'm sorry.  But I turn around, and yes.  I'm sorry.  He had a bloody leg.  I'm sorry.  Let me do this.  Let me do this to myself.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Well, what are you doing?  You tell a story?  Give that punchline?  Get it out of the way?  Well, we're trying to be...  That was the whole shocker moment of it.  I turned around to look.  He was limping. 
[00:08:30]  He had a bandana tied around his leg.  Tell him, Fred.  And his leg was soaked in blood.  And I thought...  Ah, why don't you tell what I...  Good thing this one had a phone call.  That would have went, all right, Ant on the phone has a guy with a bloody leg.  And I was feeling confident, and I figured I'd interrupt your story, because I thought I had something to add.  And what I had to add, stunk.  And then, and I assume that you already said the bloody leg part. 
[00:09:00]  No, no, I hadn't gotten there yet.  We are trying to be better listeners on this show.  That ain't working.  And obviously, I'm feeling miserably already.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  I really am.  I really thought you said that.  You had a bloody leg.  Well, the bandana was what?  The tourniquet.  You think it was a tourniquet?  Yeah, it absolutely was.  He had tied a tourniquet around his leg.  It was soaked from, like, his bottom of his ass cheek.  And it wasn't like he pissed himself for shit or anything, because it wasn't like the back of his pants. 
[00:09:30]  It was his thigh all the way down his pant leg.  And it was one of those thick, denim, homeless guy jeans, you know?  They're real thick.  And it was just soaked right through.  And he's limping and walking.  And I guess he went down into the subway.  Oh, good.  Because Danny was coming out of the subway, and he saw him limping down and figured he would avoid him at all costs.  And, yeah, but it's just a typical morning in New York. 
[00:10:00]  Anywhere else, that would be huge.  There would probably be people stopping him, saying, lay down.  We'll call an ambulance.  Oh, my God, this guy's been stabbed or shot or something.  And here in New York, it's just like, I hope he doesn't hit me over the head with a brick.  Oh, there he goes.  Or I hope he doesn't bleed on me.  Yeah, don't bleed on me.  You're so right.  And there were little dots of blood on the crosswalk and the sidewalk and stuff.  Ah, there he goes.  Another guy just shot or stabbed.  You just see so much stuff in New York City that after a while, you're just like, ah, I'm sure he'll be all right. 
[00:10:30]  Ah, whatever.  Ah, whatever.  Right.  Another homeless guy.  Ah, whatever.  Who cares?  There's no caring.  I don't care.  I didn't care.  And we were discussing in the office before the show that something goes on just before we arrive to work.  Like, there's a whole, there's all sorts of stuff going on in the middle of the night in New York City.  And then we get up a little earlier than most people, so we get to see the tail end of the craziness.  We're in the transitional phase. 
[00:11:00]  The transitional phase between just animals just running around New York City at night and then, you know, the business people getting up and getting ready to go to work.  We see the tail end, like you described so nicely today.  That's what it is.  It's the transition between the animals at night killing each other and drinking and having sex in the streets.  And then the daytime, where if you drive around New York, you know, that's the Giuliani Bloomberg New York, the one that is safe with a low crime rate and great economy, tourism, shoppers. 
[00:11:30]  There's people working, great working economy.  That's the one everyone wants you to know about.  But at night, and not at night, like the nightlife, because that's cool too.  We're talking the early morning hours when people lose their minds and when the kooks and criminals come out. 
[00:12:00]  We're talking between, I would say, 2 a.m. and 5.30 a.m.  Yeah.  They did something with the crime rate here in New York City, but it's not like they, because the crime really went down a lot.  They just reduced the number of hours it happens in.  It used to happen, like, all day and all night long.  But now they've just reduced it where all the crime you could fit in happens between, like, 2 a.m. and 5.30 instead of, you know, 10 o'clock at night where it used to happen or, you know, 8. 
[00:12:30]  Even in the afternoon, if you went into Central Park, it was dangerous.  Now it's all safe for those allotted hours.  But there's that time period where, look out.  Yeah, we've got to make a list of all the crazy things we've seen on the way into work.  Oh, it's just mess.  Because you have a story almost once a week of something.  Yeah, there's always something when I'm walking in.  Some weird little thing.  And this is just because a lot of people, I guess, wouldn't notice these things because they just walk, you know, kind of tunnel vision.  I'm constantly looking what's going on. 
[00:13:00]  It's more than that.  It's also because we're up just a little earlier than everyone else.  I'm telling you.  I mean, there's homeless people all over the, not all over, I don't want to exaggerate, but the one block that we kind of walk together in the morning, there's always a couple, you know, homeless people still, you know, sleeping.  That's where the subway greats are, I guess.  They're not being rousted up yet.  You know, by the time the average businessman, businesswoman starts wandering around New York, then all that stuff is cleaned up.  The cops are rousting up and telling them to sleep somewhere else. 
[00:13:30]  Well, they're just waking up, the homeless, when we get, when we're walking by.  Who the hell is Mark Patrick?  So they're taking leaks.  Huh?  What?  I don't know.  Sorry.  They're taking leaks and dumps like anybody else does when they wake up in the morning, you know, first thing.  So you see the homeless guys waking up and they're pissing on mailboxes and pissing on mailboxes, driving through people's backyards.  Sorry, Anthony.  Jim in Virginia, what's up?  Hey, morning, fellas.  How y'all doing? 
[00:14:00]  Hey, Jim.  Hey, listen, I was switching over during a commercial yesterday and picked up the MLB channel for a second.  Mark Patrick took a shot at you guys.  Oh?  Apparently, Rob Dibble was on yesterday.  Great interview, by the way.  Oh, thanks.  And, you know, they said to Mark Patrick, we heard Rob on the show, and Mark Patrick said,  oh, you're the one guy listening to Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's time to fall in an attack, fellas.  Punch down.  Who is Mark Patrick?  What does he do?  I don't even, I don't, never heard the name in my life. 
[00:14:30]  What does he do?  Oh, he's not.  Ah, all right.  Is he an ex-player?  Mark Patrick?  Who's Mark Patrick, Ben?  We had him on the show.  Oh, we had Mark Patrick on the show?  Yeah, I remember.  Did he enjoy himself?  It was the morning show on the baseball show.  On Home Plate?  Yeah.  We had him on...  Home Plate, you know that?  Yeah, XM-175.  Wow.  I'm having a clue.  I like to know a little something about the company I work for.  I know where the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s channel is. 
[00:15:00]  Actually, I love that channel, the baseball show.  Yeah.  All right, well, what...  Did we have him on?  Yeah, we had him on twice.  Remember, he bombed the second time.  Oh, that guy.  That's why we don't remember having him on.  He didn't do too well the first time.  Oh, boy.  He was the guy doing all the hacky radio and the hacky, like, voices and stuff.  Uh-huh.  Oh, that guy.  All right, now I see.  I knew there was some motive there somewhere.  He probably heard from our listeners.  He probably made that comment as a joke or something. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know.  Yeah.  All right, that guy.  We'll leave him alone.  Let's find out what it's about first.  It doesn't matter, to be honest with you.  He's being a douche.  All right.  So that's how it starts, with a limping Jamaican.  Limping Jamaican who was either stabbed or shot.  And a little later this morning, Anthony, we got one of our pests coming in.  A pest?  Yeah, we had another assault on the media two days in a row.  The assaults on the media are picking up big time. 
[00:16:00]  Was that the beach?  The beach one.  The shark attack.  Yeah, there was a shark attack in Jersey, but there's a lot of people...  They don't even know if it was.  And the newspaper puts a big picture of a great white with his big teeth.  You know that shot you always see of the great white?  Yeah.  Shark attack in Jersey.  And they're like, well, we're not sure what it was.  Could have been a grouper.  Like, it could have been a grouper.  A grouper or a great white.  Or a bluefish.  A bluefish?  The bluefish have some nasty teeth as well. 
[00:16:30]  They needed the money!  Oh!  So a kid's surfing, and something took a bite out of his leg.  Yeah.  And they're trying to, of course, get everybody scared.  A lot of fear.  They love fear-mongering the news.  So they put, like, a big picture of Jaws.  They say it was a great white.  And then they show his ankle.  And it's pretty bad for, you know, an ankle wound.  But it looks like something you could have gotten scraping on a rock or something. 
[00:17:00]  You know?  And they talked to some expert, and he said, well, it looks like it could be a great white.  Great white?  Get out of here.  It was a rock.  Guy scraped his foot on a rock.  Nah, it doesn't make a good story, though.  It looked like something, bitum.  You think?  Yeah, a little bite.  How could you tell what it was, though?  A little nibble.  A nibble?  Yeah.  Took, like, a little taste.  A little taste.  They said, ugh, that's what happens with these shark attacks.  They take a bite and realize, ugh, this is not what I eat, and they move on. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  But, man, the news just losing their minds over this shark attack.  Yeah, they love it.  This, quote, shark attack, we don't know for sure.  They love the fear-mongering.  But I guess the parents sent the picture of the wound down to some expert in, of course, Florida or something.  And they said that it could very well be, like you said, a great white.  Yeah, his name was Matt Hooper, the expert, and sent it down, too.  So, of course, the news people all over the beach.  Where was it?  Long Beach, New Jersey or something like that? 
[00:18:00]  And old Pat Battle.  She's been doing, I don't know, news for New York.  Pat Battle.  She's a black lady, I believe, right?  Yeah.  She's older than time itself.  She's been around for a really long time.  And she's doing a whole...  Oh, awesome.  We're really getting under Howard's skin today.  Sorry.  Oh, really?  The ADD's kicking in really bad today.  Oh, Pete.  Yeah, someone started to get through to Stern this morning about his XM commercial that we play.  And Howard lost his mind. 
[00:18:30]  A caller on Howard's show mentioned the live read you guys play on him.  Wait.  A caller on Howard's show mentioned the live read you guys play of him promoting XM.  Howard dumped out of the call, hung up on the caller, and said you guys should die.  He seemed upset and was distracted.  I sent Steve the clip.  Get it.  Here we go.  So, this is how we work now.  Howard, one more thing.  One more thing, and I'll let you go.  I was pleased to see that.  It wasn't a beautiful ad. 
[00:19:00]  I don't know who their copy department is, but it got the job done.  Probably just, you know, rushed in.  Howard.  One more thing.  Yes, sir.  I heard, I was listening to the other satellite company.  My friend has the XM.  Right.  And, you know, those two eights doing a commercial.  Who cares?  Let them die.  Let them die.  That's it.  We don't care.  I bleeped that off, and I just let them die.  That's all.  We don't care. 
[00:19:30]  He dumped out.  That's so obvious.  We don't care.  Dumping out, huh?  Can't handle it, Howard.  Can't handle it.  Can't take it.  Oops.  Yeah, he doesn't care, all right.  Yeah, come on.  All comers.  Come on.  I'll take you on.  Oh, dump out of that.  I don't even want to acknowledge.  Let them die.  I did hear, because we do have a lot of people that are, you know, friendly with us still at the old company. 
[00:20:00]  Uh-huh.  And it's driving Howard nuts that we have a commercial of him doing, you know, an XM read.  And, you know, the company's not going to help him at this point.  In the old days, they would shut us up and make us stop playing the ad.  But they don't care.  So we're allowed to keep playing it, and Howard is just fuming.  And he's losing his mind, but there's nothing he can do about it.  And obviously that caller got through to talk about it and see what Howard thought about the whole thing.  But Howard decided to dump out and say that we should die and that he doesn't care. 
[00:20:30]  He doesn't want any confusion is what it is.  He's, you know, he's a little nervous about the move, and he doesn't want confusion with anybody where he's going to end up.  And all that commercial spot does is confuse people.  They tell their friends that don't have satellite, oh, yeah, I heard, you know, if somebody's friend, somebody has XM, their friend is a Howard fan,  and they go, yeah, Howard's going to satellite, yeah, I heard on XM. 
[00:21:00]  I heard the commercial, because believe me, that stuff happens.  People get confused.  So they buy XM, and that's, God, Howard's livid.  Just livid.  And the company is livid.  Yep.  But there's nothing they can do about it.  Well, of course.  Radio, this is what's getting them really pissed off this morning.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM satellite radio along for the ride.  XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock, alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop, unsigned bands, blues, jazz. 
[00:21:30]  There's an XM channel for everyone in the family, including the biggest names in news, sports, talk, and comedy,  all in digital quality sound for less than $10 a month.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service.  The XM Roadie from Delphi can turn any radio into an XM radio.  It's the smallest satellite radio ever, so it looks great on your dashboard.  Plus, for a limited time, you'll also get a free home kit, so you can connect XM to any home stereo.  XM makes a great graduation or Father's Day gift.  Check it out. 
[00:22:00]  Electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City.  Beyond AM, Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Ah, thank you, Howard.  And once again from this morning.  Howard, one more thing, one more thing, and I'll let you go.  I was pleased to see that.  It wasn't a beautiful ad.  I don't know who their copy department is, but it got the job done.  Probably just, you know, rushed in.  Howard, one more thing.  Yes, sir.  I heard, I was listening to the other satellite company, my friend has, the XM. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  And, you know, those two doing a commercial.  Who cares?  Let them die.  Let them die.  So much.  And I said, we don't care.  I bleeped that off, and I just let them die.  That's all.  We don't care.  Yeah, you don't care, all right.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  You really don't care.  Again, he doesn't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My jokes don't go over. 
[00:23:00]  I don't care.  Boom, boom, boom.  I don't care.  I don't care.  He doesn't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  He doesn't care.  I don't care.  I'm happy-go-lucky, women call me puk-puk-puk-y.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  He's not stopping.  He just keeps going on and on. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, my God, it's not funny, anyone.  I don't care.  The best part is when he goes zoom, zoom, zoom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Anyway, so we had another assault on the media yesterday.  So they're doing the story on the shark attack in Long Beach, New Jersey.  Yep.  And Pat Battle's doing a serious report on the shark and the bite.  And all of a sudden, behind her, on the beach.  Oh, you see out of one little corner, you see a little person start making the move, 
[00:24:00]  which is personally my favorite part of any assault on the media,  is when you just see him come into frame real far away.  They're back there because you know it's coming.  And that's the first sign of him.  And you see him, right-hand side, lower corner.  You see him pop in and then comes right up behind the reporter with an Opie and Anthony sign.  Homemade.  Homemade Opie and Anthony sign this time around.  Opie and Anthony really big and the nice XM logo right in the middle, Anthony.  Here he comes running up the beach right behind her. 
[00:24:30]  She's trying to do a serious report on a shark attack.  Just being a pest.  Yeah, I love it.  Good job.  That guy's coming in later today.  You can see the video up on opianthony.com.  The guy has just a huge smile because he knows he got the job done, too.  Look at this.  A real serious report trying to get everyone scared.  In these very waters.  And there's a shark attack.  And there he is.  You see the kid running up the beach, Jimmy?  Here he comes. 
[00:25:00]  Look at the pest.  Hey!  Opie and Anthony XM!  Opie and Anthony XM!  And then he just stands there smiling with his shirt off and his sign going, you can't do nothing about this.  Didn't he have Speedos on, too?  Yeah, it looks like he had his Speedo on.  Wow.  That one's pretty funny.  It's up on opianthony.com for your viewing pleasure.  That would have been good if the cameraman or somebody involved at the station would have tried to chase him because it's so funny watching people run in the sand. 
[00:25:30]  Especially a guy holding a camera.  Well, you know what?  They deserve it, the media.  To actually go to the beach.  That's not a story.  No.  How about being honest and saying, yeah, speculation there was a shark attack, but we just don't know yet.  Yeah, we don't know.  Sharks in these waters off New Jersey.  A danger this summer?  Shark attack.  Could it happen to you?  Not even.  Tune in.  They don't even tell you it's Jersey.  They make sure the whole listening area is paranoid.  Shark attack in our area.  What? 
[00:26:00]  Can you be in danger?  Hey, man, I swim in a pond in Pennsylvania.  I live on a lake.  Right, I live...  Sharks in lakes.  Lake sharks.  What?  Right.  Really?  I'll have to tune in.  And for you people that swim in ponds, oh, are you really safe?  Yeah, are you safe?  Shut the fuck up.  And the answer is yes.  Yes, you are.  But they don't tell you that.  Well, they'll tell you at like 1058.  A hidden danger.  Yeah, shark attacks at the beach.  You live at the lake.  Is it safe? 
[00:26:30]  A hidden danger you may not know about.  Right.  What?  I may...  I may not.  Well, actually, I don't.  I don't know about that danger.  Well, I better watch the whole news.  I'm going to have to watch now, dammit.  And just before the fluff piece, they're going to finally give me the answer I need.  It's got to be coming up next, right?  No?  I'll have to wait another commercial break.  Find out what the danger in the lake is.  Bastards.  Oh, that would have been funny.  Rob in New Jersey.  Go ahead, Rob.  The only thing that would have made that assault on the median better is if he would 
[00:27:00]  have had one of those fake shark fins on his head behind her.  With Opie and Anthony written on it.  Absolutely.  Yes.  You know, eventually we're going to have to take this to the next level.  We were kind of hinting about that yesterday.  I mean, these assaults on the media, they're so much fun to watch and download and all that.  But I think we really need to start getting some costumes involved.  Well, yeah.  Some silliness.  It is a lot more fun when something happens unexpected.  Like, the assault on the media, you're expecting the sign that says ONA. 
[00:27:30]  And believe me, we're not complaining at all.  We love it.  The guy yesterday did a great job.  Perfect.  But you're expecting, you know, the sign and the ONA XM satellite radio.  But you'd never expect the guy in the gorilla suit.  You know, when we saw that guy.  It just makes it that much more funny and enjoyable.  What about the guy in the Gumby suit?  The guy in the Gumby suit.  There he is.  There's the picture.  Eric just popped that up.  Yeah.  Yeah, a guy in a Gumby suit. 
[00:28:00]  There's another guy with some kind of light-up hat.  Just a lot of fun little props that could be incorporated in.  Obviously, that guy was at the beach and saw the camera crew there and was very resourceful.  Kind of MacGyvered things there and got the sign together.  So that was cool.  But, yeah, we would love some kind of real, real distraction.  It's so funny because these reporters think they're safe, but they're just not.  Our pests are everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  One of our pests got through to Howard today. 
[00:28:30]  They're just pests.  And just wrecked his morning.  Now he's going to have a horrendous show once again.  The pests.  They call up Don and Mike and talk about Don's dead dog.  It's just hysterical.  Just pests.  It's so annoying.  Jimmy came up with that term, and I love it.  Pest.  Coming soon to the Opin' Anthony program, your official pest t-shirt.  Oh!  Official.  We're merchandising the shit out of this show.  Every little catchphrase. 
[00:29:00]  Why not, man?  All right.  I got something to play, and I don't want to wreck a joke twice or wreck two jokes in the  first segment.  I apologize once again to you, Anthony.  It wasn't really a joke.  It was just the...  Well, not a joke, but a nice story.  It was the big, shocking moment.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  That he was bleeding.  It didn't matter.  It just kind of saved everybody the trouble of just, like, listening more.  It got to the point quickly.  I like it.  It got to the point.  I was going to...  I was going to call it my drama.  I was going to explain what the...  My drama.  I was going to explain what this little piece is that I was about to play, but I think 
[00:29:30]  that would take away from...  That could, yeah.  So I'm just going to hit play and let the fine folks enjoy this, okay?  All righty.  Look, he started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car.  What do you want, fucko?  You want something, huh? 
[00:30:00]  What are you doing?  Oh, no.  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck.  I swear to my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead.  Hold my hand, man.  I got to squeeze something.  Ah, fuck.  Who saw that coming?  That's a good one.  That's a really good one.  Anything from Goodfellas is good.  More good.  Harry Hill and Bob Kelly getting together. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Yes, that was Harry T.  And just when you thought the Bob Kelly remixes were dead, getting to the point of overplayed,  that little beauty came in overnight from Harry T.  Very good job.  Just when you thought it was dead as dead.  Pulp fiction.  I know.  I was trying to remember.  Coke is dead as dead.  Dead.  Okay, we're going to take our first break, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  When we get back, we got lots to do today.  We really do.  Russell Crowe on Letterman last night.  Yeah, I guess they were kind of discussing his little altercation at the hotel.  Right.  We also have Brad Pitt with Diane Sawyer.  We have Tom Cruise on Oprah.  Yeah.  We have Bin Laden's niece.  We haven't gotten to that yet?  Not yet.  Okay.  That'll be some interesting listening.  And Cousin Brucey is in negotiations with someone.  Really?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:31:30]  Well, that's the big news.  We better get on the ball over here.  Which politician is that?  That's, um...  Chuck Schumer.  Is it Chuck Schumer?  Ugh.  Chuck Schumer.  This guy is the biggest publicity hound.  What an ass.  He goes to the...  I saw this guy.  What is he, a senator?  Yeah.  I know him and Hillary just hang out together, basically.  Oh, he has his head buried up Hillary's ass.  He's a senator or something here in New York, I guess.  I was at the Oyster Festival. 
[00:32:00]  If Hillary is O&A, Chuck Schumer is Jim Norton.  Wow.  Just jumping on the coattails.  Everything she says, he goes, okay, sure.  Okay, sure.  Good point.  Good point.  This guy...  I'm teasing, of course, Jimmy.  You're absolutely right.  Please.  I didn't think I picked up a fledgling radio show.  I did my research.  This politician, Anthony, he loves seeing his name in lights, loves seeing his name in 
[00:32:30]  print, loves seeing his face on TV.  I was aware of that when I went to the Oyster Fest in Oyster Bay, Long Island.  The Oyster Fest?  Just a dumb little thing where you eat oysters, drink beer.  Did you see Jackie there?  Actually, yeah.  That's where I met Jackie for the first time.  And then I saw him a few times after that.  Yeah.  It turns out he's a really nice guy.  And, yeah, you just eat oysters, you drink beers, you check out some music, you eat some  other type of food, and your people watch, right? 
[00:33:00]  No real big deal.  It happens every year in Oyster Bay.  Although I think they took the beer away.  Of course.  Of course.  Take any fun away.  And Chuck Schumer was there, you know, to shake some hands and kiss some babies as these  politicians do.  Yeah.  He had people walking with him with huge signs saying, do you want to meet Chuck Schumer?  And they were his people.  His people that walk with him.  So you can't help but see these huge signs, because they're holding up as high as they 
[00:33:30]  can above all the people.  Oh, boy.  And in the middle of these signs is Chuck Schumer.  And then look at me.  You just walk around, and if someone recognizes you and comes up and wants to comment, that's  fine.  Of course.  Of course.  Drawing attention to yourself.  Of course.  But he had a whole, you know, he had a staff of people, you know, three or four people  holding signs.  Like kind of in a square, and then he was in the middle.  So anyway, Chuck Schumer, the senator of New York, has decided that it's really important  to get Cousin Brucey a new job.  Yeah.  He's spearheading this operation. 
[00:34:00]  I don't know, on the to-do list for New York, on the to-do list, if you're one of the senators  of the great state of New York, how far down is making sure Cousin Brucey gets his job?  I think that's pretty low down on the priority list.  I would say it's so low down on the list that you wouldn't have a minute for it in your schedule.  This guy is just a publicity-seeking douchebag. 
[00:34:30]  Well, he did this knowing it would get his name out there a little more, and people like  us would talk about it, and, you know, and the news stations are going to talk about it  today.  We're playing right into his hands.  Of course.  Basically, Chuck Schumer said he wants to find Cousin Brucey in another DJ gig.  I think Cousin Brucey will be fine.  The guy is a multi-millionaire.  I don't think anyone should be concerned about Cousin Brucey finding work. 
[00:35:00]  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  But he goes on to say, a piece of New York will be gone if he's gone, Schumer told the  Post yesterday.  How about dealing with the piece of New York that is gone, the Trade Center, and getting  together and actually agreeing on something and starting to build it?  How about spearheading that?  You hear all these little suggestions, but you don't hear one politician really digging  his heels in and, if I may say digging his heels in, and really going for it, you know?  Making some noise that way. 
[00:35:30]  Christ.  A DJ getting his job back?  Where was he when we got fired?  Yeah.  Where was Chuck Schumer?  A piece of New York heading, getting O&A back on the air.  A piece of New York was gone about three years ago.  A piece of shit of New York.  That's what makes New York great, though.  It's all the, it's the variety of things.  So why just save the good, the good stuff?  The smorgasbord, isn't it?  A cornucopia.  A piece of New York will be gone if he's gone, Schumer told the Post yesterday, hours 
[00:36:00]  after mounting a drive to save a slot on the airwaves for the Radio Hall of Famer.  Cousin Brucie, an icon on New York Airwaves since the late 50s, was let go after 20 years  at WCBSF, when the station, with no warning, announced a format change last Friday.  Put him over at the hip-hop station.  That'd be funny.  Hey, hey, cousins.  This is for all the darkies.  Hey, cousins.  I got my gaff, cousins. 
[00:36:30]  Like we used to say in the 60s, hose him down.  Hey.  That would be great.  Can you imagine Cousin Brucie on a hip-hop station?  Cousin Brucie gets hired by the hip-hop station.  Doing shootouts to all the homies?  Here's a 50 cent.  Wee.  Hey, cousins.  Schumer, who in his youth revered Cousin Brucie, then with WABC Radio, is acting every bit the  obsessed teenager by banging out letters. 
[00:37:00]  He's banging out letters.  Oh, boy.  To New York stations begging them to give the legend another shot on the airwaves.  What stations would he be relevant at?  Well, guess who he's negotiating with.  Um, who?  Well, it wouldn't be this company.  I could say that there's another satellite company in the papers.  Yeah.  They are apparently negotiating with Chuck Schumer.  How do you know?  Well, you know, I got my nose to the grindstone, as they say.  Cousin Brucie offered $500 million.  Yeah, by Sirius.  It's around somewhere. 
[00:37:30]  I am confident that there's some radio station that can make money using Cousin Brucie's great  talents.  He's a New York institution.  Schumer is so intent on lending Cousin Brucie another job, he launched a Save Cousin Brucie  poll.  Are you kidding me?  This guy has this much time?  Even placing it under the Top Issues banner on his official Senate website.  Great. 
[00:38:00]  That's what we need in this state.  That's what one of the senators should be working on.  Getting a DJ his job back.  There we go.  Where would he be when you needed him?  Yeah.  Nowhere.  We just talked about that, Jim.  I know.  I know you know.  I actually didn't agree.  So far, two examples I'm not listening already today.  No, I'm listening.  In the first 40 minutes of the show, maybe the listeners could point out other incidents.  Incidences. 
[00:38:30]  Incidences.  Right.  Cousin Brucie may be on air in orbit.  What?  May be on air in orbit.  Uh-huh.  It says that he's negotiating with Sirius Satellite Radio.  That's all it really says.  Of course.  And then, of course, Chuck Schumer.  Well, he's probably talking with, you know, I'm sure he's talking with somebody here,  too.  I'm sure he's talking about how it works.  Of course.  You don't talk with one satellite company and not the other.  Right.  You must play them against each other to get as much money as possible at them. 
[00:39:00]  That's how the game works.  Well, Cousin Brucie has a lot of light on him right now.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Mel.  Go ahead, Mel.  Tell us a few bucks.  We're going to take our first break, Anthony.  All righty.  Speaking of CBS FM.  Hi.  Remember the jingles?  We got more jingles that came in today.  More jingles?  More jingles came in today.  I like the Greg and Tony show one.  The one that...  How does that one go?  It's the Greg and Tony show. 
[00:39:30]  The Greg and Tony show.  Greg and Tony have Dr. Norton with, and I forget, forget, forget...  Sex advice.  Sex advice.  Wearing a bag.  Get the Hiv.  Get the Hiv.  On XM202 or something like that.  It's not like that.  See, it's catchy.  It's the Greg and Tony show.  Well, that guy redid his, and we got...  That's kind of my favorite one so far.  I don't know which I like better.  The Greg, the first, the original that you can't hear, or the new one?  I'll have to hear both.  Yeah, yeah.  The new one now, we just heard it before the show.  The vocals are up front.  You can understand every word, but I kind of like not being able to understand it. 
[00:40:00]  I'd like to take a little vote on a side-by-side comparison.  That's just a thought.  And I want the Cousin Brucie poll also included.  Well, it's got to go on the site.  Steve, get to it.  You can navigate Foundry and get in there for 40 minutes.  You'll find the Cousin, Cousin Brucie.  Our phone's just exploded again.  What happened?  You mean literally, not this time.  I don't know.  Not in a good way?  They just went away again.  Not in that good way.  All right, when we get back, we'll get into the jingles that came in overnight.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the Olai virus. 
[00:40:30]  I really don't care if a stripper likes me or hates me.  I don't either.  I mean, you're just really bothered by it.  It's just like, do your job.  It's just the whole thing that they're not just coming up to him.  Being naked at all.  Just flash it.  What the fuck is that?  And then that awful energy of a bouncer, they're like, what are we going to do, rape you in  studios, stupid?  Well, good point.  This guy's not really a bouncer.  He plays golf with Rich Voss.  All right.  He's a three handicap. 
[00:41:00]  I mean, what kind of bouncer is he?  He drives the Rolls Royce.  He's good with a 9-iron.  Crack him.  Never.  They don't think I'm funny.  I do cancer jokes.  They don't ever laugh at me.  When they do a lap dance, you fart.  They'll fucking think it's funny when they do that.  Never think I'm funny.  Dead garlic coming from your muff muff.  Never.  You know who thinks I'm funny?  Fucking psycho fat chick.  You think I'm a hoot.  Never fucking strippers.  A hoot.  Oh, that guy.  Oh, okay. 
[00:41:30]  You know what, though?  Everybody's got to make a living.  What do you think?  Eh, man, whatever.  Just one of the captain left.  That's all that really matters, you know?  I like to entertain people.  I'm lucky.  I'm living a full life in a new place.  Getting it all painted.  I feel good.  These girls hit the title label.  They always just fucking drain you, and they want nothing to do with me, and I know they  don't.  I know they don't.  I know they don't.  It's fucking annoying.  And they can't even hide the fact how much they fucking hate my guts, which makes me sick.  But then again, there's a certain honesty I kind of like about that.  There's something about a girl just telling the truth that makes me feel good inside. 
[00:42:00]  You know, they have to love it.  They have to love it.  So what are those whores doing?  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you? 
[00:42:30]  Has someone taken your face?  It's real, the pain you feel.  You trust, you must, get fast.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  And we're off to a great start this morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Still can't get over the fact that the senator of New York is trying to get Cousin Brucey a job  on another New York radio station.  Yeah, I really do think the hip-hop station is a great place for Cousin Brucey to branch out. 
[00:43:00]  You know, he's done the oldies thing long enough.  Put him on one of the hip-hop stations.  Yeah, for the people around America, he had a very unique delivery.  Hey, cousins.  Hey, cousins.  That's exactly how he sounded on the air.  Yeah.  I don't know what that means.  Everything was just, hey.  Oh, all we have is.  You got your Cousin Brucey with you.  We do have the intro.  So, this is his intro, and it's his actual voice, just to give you an idea of what he 
[00:43:30]  sounded like on his show.  And he just babbled about nothing.  He had nothing really to say.  Nah.  He's famous for being the guy that played your oldies.  Yeah.  Played the oldies music.  I'm ready to rock and roll.  I'm ready to rock and roll.  And as we said in the 60s, he...  As we said in the 60s...  I don't get that.  E-e-e-e-e-e.  As we said in the 60s, e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e. 
[00:44:00]  What?  Scooby-Scooby-Doo.  Did anyone say that in the 60s?  Nope.  Peace?  You said peace.  Or maybe if you were on a bus and you said, get out of that seat.  E-e-e-e-e.  As we said in the 60s, e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e.  We did say a lot of things in the 60s.  Hell no, we won't go.  Right, but one of them wasn't.  They said that.  One of them wasn't e-e-e-e-e-e.  E-e-e-e. 
[00:44:30]  How's the Tate girl doing?  Right.  That's something they might have said.  Sure.  Nixon's the one.  Yeah.  Remember that?  The whole campaign for Nixon to be re-elected.  John Duck.  Huh?  Huh?  I don't know.  Everybody who loves the 60s say, baby.  Baby. 
[00:45:00]  As we said in the 60s when we looked at thalidomide babies,  eeeh, eeeh, eeeh, eeeh, eeeh.  Eeeh.  Yeah, you should branch out now, though.  Yeah, maybe.  He's done the oldies long enough.  Maybe work for Hot 97 and intro some rap songs. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, we're going to put on some music for you, my niggas.  How about this one, Cousin Brucey?  99 problems.  If you have a girl problems, I feel bad for you, son.  I got 99 problems, but it ain't one.  99 problems, but the bitch ain't one.  Eeeh.  Eeeh.  Put your guns in the air like you just don't eat.  Oh, it's speed.  I don't think Cousin Brucey would be able to sell this. 
[00:46:00]  No, you don't think so?  All out of touch.  I don't think the Cousin Brucey's listeners want to hear this, either.  Do you know how funny that would be?  I'm about to witness the strength of street knowledge.  Eeeh.  Straight out of Compton.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Straight out of Compton.  NWA.  Straight out of Compton.  NWA.  From the gang-cored niggas with attitude.  Don't bust a cap in this animal on my head. 
[00:46:30]  Eeeh.  Hey, Cous.  I'm sure Cousin Brucey will be just fine there.  Yeah, I wouldn't worry about him.  All right.  Plenty of job opportunities for the Cousin. 
[00:47:00]  Now, that's a jingle.  The listeners still don't understand what a jingle is.  No, they're doing promos, songs.  That's a jingle.  Announcements.  We're looking for jingles.  And our listeners are sending in jingles for the Opie and Anthony program, and we got another,  I don't know, 11, I guess, overnight.  Some are jingles.  Some are songs.  Some are, we don't know what they are.  Like announcements.  Announcements, right.  It's an announcement.  Can we all agree this is our favorite one so far?  This one right here. 
[00:47:30]  Come on.  Opie!  Anthony!  And Norton, too!  Good times, great hits!  XF-202!  Suck my fucking cock!  That's a great one.  So far, that's the best one that has come in.  And that's from Tall Man.  So you want to hear the latest ones?  Yeah.  They're interesting, to say the least. 
[00:48:00]  Well, our listeners, I love the computer age, don't you?  We put the word out, and you get these things the same day.  They used to have to record them and put them on tape and mail them to you.  Now you get them the same day.  Right.  Sometimes that's good, sometimes that's bad.  Sorry, I was interrupted, Anthony.  Tom Cruise is jumping all over Jay Leno's couch, because that's what he does now.  He jumps on couches all over the place.  Now he jumps on couches, and I've seen this jump on the couch thing five times this morning so far. 
[00:48:30]  Do you know how many I'm going to be if he got scuff marks where I have to sit?  Oh!  Wait, that's right!  How dare he put his shoes on that couch when Jimmy Norton's going to be sitting in that very seat?  That damn Tom.  When?  Monday!  So, Monday!  Hopefully they'll shampoo that.  That's right.  Actually, if it was me, I would just throw the couch out and order a new one.  Could be some germs from his shoes. 
[00:49:00]  Jimmy's going to be on Jay Leno on Monday night.  All right, here we go, Anthony.  Here's the first jingle that came in overnight.  Maybe this is live on the Cam 202.  It's Yopi, Yopi, Yopi, and Anthony.  Too long.  Is that an accordion?  Yeah.  Wait till we get to the...  Accordion music.  Okay.  Wait till we get to the Barbershop Quartet.  Oh!  There's a couple of those that came in.  Great.  Maybe this is live on the Cam 202. 
[00:49:30]  It's Yopi, Yopi, Yopi, and Anthony.  I like how they're just pulling music from places and making the words fit.  Because God knows where he got that from.  Polkocyte.  Here's the next one that came in.  And now it's time for Scott Peterson's favorite show, Yopi and Anthony.  See, that's like a news bumper.  That's like what you hear at the beginning of the news show.  Right.  You know, now you're reporters. 
[00:50:00]  You're team news reporters.  You know?  That's not a jingle.  With Dick Hurts on sports.  They put the picture up and smiling.  They turn their head to the camera and smile.  And weather.  You know, hey.  And he turns their head with all these wacky graphics going on behind him.  Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.  And now.  Oh. 
[00:50:30]  It's Donkey 3 Radio on XM202 with that possible trio of Jim, Greg, and Tony.  Sponsored by Lucky Strike.  This week on the show, Jim carries pages out of Native Son.  Brother Joe stops in to plug his band, not Duke Ellington.  Greg shows off his new skateboarder.  And Tony discusses radar technology.  Kind of hard to hear. 
[00:51:00]  A little hard to hear.  Going with the old-time jingle there.  You were talking about skateboarding.  Yeah.  I don't know what Jimmy was going to do.  I was talking about radar technology.  And Jimmy was going to rip pages out of an author's book or something like that?  Yeah.  A jelly donut from wackbag.com came up with that one, Anthony.  Trying to give it that old 40s sound.  All right.  Let's listen to this one.  This one.  Again, not a jingle, though.  Right.  It's like a PSA film or something.  From New York City to San Diego, it's the Spuds Buckley and Burt Convy Hair Show. 
[00:51:30]  Only on XM Channel 202.  Featuring meaty tit's own sports and the bill's dead lady with the weather.  I'm not kidding you, bitch.  Produced by Ben's hog.  Can you critique ad nauseam on wackbag.com?  Unless you have Rich Vosfinger to tune your XM radio to Channel 202, Burt Convy Hair, and  the Spuds Buckley Show.  I like that one. 
[00:52:00]  It's pretty good.  Burt Convy Hair.  Where'd he come up with that?  I get Burt Convy Hair.  That's pretty funny.  It's true, isn't it?  Burt Convy.  When I am in need of a haircut, it does kind of puff up like Burt Convy's hair.  Burt Convy Hair.  What a reference.  Tattletales.  The host of Tattletales.  The best is, unless you're Rich Vosfinger.  Tune in.  Unless you have little Rich Vosfinger.  Yeah, yeah.  Tune in to 202.  All right, here's the Greg and Tony show that we played yesterday, the improved version. 
[00:52:30]  Greg, Tony show.  We can hear the lyrics.  The Greg and Tony show, Greg and Tony show, Greg and Tony got done for Norton with sex  advice, wear no bag, spread the hip, it's on XM.  I kind of like the other one better.  Do you have the original?  It's a little hard on here.  Yeah, okay.  It's creepier where you can't quite make out the word.  Oh, this guy's a, just, is this Pappy?  The guy who did this one? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, Pappy.  Oh, he's a creep.  Pappy.  I don't know which one I like better.  I like them both.  Well, here's the original that came in yesterday.  Nope.  Maybe not.  It's creepier when you can't understand it.  Yeah.  No?  No.  No?  Hit it.  No.  Hawk.  I don't know what's going on.  Why isn't the CD play working?  Click, click, click.  Come on.  There we go.  Thanks, Hawk.  Oh, I don't agree. 
[00:53:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  How come I can hear it perfectly fine now?  It's weird.  It's almost like when you'd read Highlights Magazine.  Yes.  You'd be looking in those fine something here.  Uh-huh.  Fine way to get the lad into your lap.  Come help me look.  And once you know where the things are, the little animals in the clouds, then you can't  help but see them. 
[00:54:00]  That's the way it is.  But that is so obvious now.  Yeah.  It really is.  Gray.  Tony's, yeah.  Gray.  Yeah, I like that.  All right.  Here's another one that came in overnight.

Burt Convy Hair and the Spuds Buckley.  Show.  That's not bad, right?  I like it a lot.  It's just not a jingle, I don't think.  It's not a jingle, no.  But it's very good.  That's another one of those news things, news intros.  Right.  Well, there you have it.  They're still coming in.  It's the Greg and Tony show. 
[00:58:00]  That's a jingle.  Yeah.  And a good one.  They're getting better every day, so.  Yeah, I liked it.  Not bad.  Not bad at all.  I love the Bob Kelly Goodfellas remix.  That is great.  That's a good one, too.  Stupid face hit with that gun.  And listeners get involved and start sending in their various talents.  Very talented listeners we have, aren't they?  See, it's not easy to do this.  I just love that there's so many programs available now for anybody to do this. 
[00:58:30]  This is stuff that you can download for free now that years ago, you'd only get in a studio.  Now anybody can do it.  They throw stuff together.  You can download the songs from the web.  And everyone's a producer now.  There you go.  Why do we need Steve C?  We don't.  We've got listeners out there that can put things together on their own.  Yeah, you used to have to go into a huge studio like Steve does.  A production studio.  A production studio.  Yeah, and put things like that together. 
[00:59:00]  I remember we were flying out to L.A. with Peter Wolfe, actually, and we talked to him a little bit on the plane.  And he had a laptop.  This is only 10 years ago, I guess, 95-ish.  And I remember asking him what he was doing.  And he goes, oh, I'm mixing my latest CD as I fly to L.A.  And that just blew me away at the time.  Yeah, because before that, you just didn't hear about people doing any type of production on a laptop, especially.  I thought what blew you away is that he actually had a CD coming out.  He actually puts out some good CDs. 
[00:59:30]  Does he?  Yeah, commercially, no one cares, but are pretty interesting.  But I was thinking to myself, wow, man, technology is just out of control now.  This would be something where you'd have to be in an even bigger studio with an engineer and stuff.  And he's not, he's just doing it on his laptop as he flies.  And now every pest has it available to them.  We love our pests.  Make our jingles.  All right, Russell Crowe on Letterman last night, Anthony.  Big incident here in New York City at the Mercer Hotel. 
[01:00:00]  Basically, he wants to make a phone call, and he hits some dude over the head with the phone, basically.  It's on the front page of one of the papers this morning.  Well, he couldn't get through to Australia, and this is what I love about Russell Crowe.  He took the phone out of his room.  Is that what he said?  Yeah, I'm just trying to, like, but it just, you know.  Just turn it, just turn it around once.  Wow, that is really loud.  I know, I asked for it to be what it might have been.  There you go.  There you go.  You're all, it's all good now.  It's all good.  It's all good, Jimmy.  And, um. 
[01:00:30]  What?  What happened?  Commenting on how somebody could fix it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Well, inside joke.  We're laughing to ourselves in here.  Russell Crowe wanted to make a phone call, and he couldn't make it to Australia to call his wife.  But he ripped the phone out of his room and went down to the lobby.  That's where he got the phone?  Out of his room.  I was wondering where the phone came from.  I didn't understand that either.  I thought he asked to use the phone behind the desk or something. 
[01:01:00]  And they, you know, handed it to him, and it didn't work.  So he's up there trying to make the call.  Holy crap, that's awesome.  Rips the phone out.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  And then Marches, can you imagine seeing Russell Crowe in the elevator with you,  and he's got a phone that he ripped out of the wall, and he's just holding it in his hand,  going, what the hell is he going to do?  Yeah, what are you doing with that?  Looking for a Spanish face?  Yeah, he found one.  And then.  Threw it at him.  And then he threw it at the guy downstairs that had nothing to do with it? 
[01:01:30]  Well, the guy gave an attitude, apparently.  Apparently, he talked to him.  He probably went down and went, your phone is, you know how you're in a rage,  you just want to bite somebody?  Why can't I make a call?  Yeah, look at this.  A simple phone call.  It's 2005.  I'm trying to call Australia, god damn it.  And the guy probably went.  Sir, sir, if you would calm down a second, I'm on the phone.  Yeah, he was probably like, sir, I'm doing something.  I'll be with you in a minute.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Poof right in the face.  Bam.  Yeah, those awful, those hotel employees really annoyed me,  because they give you the, well, if that's the way it is, sir. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  We can't.  You can't get through.  You impersonal fucking human voice recording.  So he probably threw it at the guy's face.  You struck a blow for all of us, Russell.  Thank you.  Thank you.  To all of us who have stayed in hotels.  That's going to cost him, though.  And dealt with bad customer service.  That's how you deal with bad customer service.  You throw the phone at the man's skull.  That's classic.  I had no idea he'd ripped it out of the wall in his room.  Coming downstairs, all huffing and puffing.  You know what, man?  You've got to beat his L with a phone in your hand and get off and still throw it at someone. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, because you've got to sit there and wait.  Yeah, the calming elevator music, and you just want to keep that rage.  Motherfucker.  That's a great visual.  You can't get through to Australia, you motherfucker.  That awful elevator music, and you're just enraged trying to keep the rage, because you're pissed.  You don't want to be calm until you find somebody.  Yeah, you don't want to focus on the music and start tapping your foot.  Tapping your foot.  Damn it, I'm not mad anymore. 
[01:03:00]  I love this song.  I know in the Park Meridian, they have a TV in the elevator right above the door,  and they play Tom and Jerry cartoons and Old Bugs Bunny and Charlie Chaplin.  So, you know, it's hard to watch those and be pissed off.  But a lot of the elevators, yeah, you would hear mellow music,  and if you're angry and want to throw a phone at a Hispanic person, that might throw you.  All right, we've got John on the phone, and he's claiming to be one of the arresting officers. 
[01:03:30]  John.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hi, John.  You were there, really?  Come on.  No, I swear to God, this isn't my real name, but I was there at the scene.  I just wanted to explain the whole phone thing.  It wasn't like a regular full-time phone that you find in the hotel.  They have cordless phones in the hotel room.  That's what he threw at the guy.  Oh, like a cordless phone, so it's just a handset.  Exactly.  He didn't actually rip anything out of the wall, because when we got him out of the room,  he still had the phone in his hand when we spoke to him.  Really nice guy, real calm and pleasant. 
[01:04:00]  Wasn't as big as the news is making it out.  Shocking that the media is lying and blowing it out of proportion.  Yeah, go figure that one.  Front page news for a couple of days here.  Did you get a picture with him?  No, I'm trying to.  I got a copy of his mugshot, though.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, but he wouldn't sign it.  He's like, nah, it's too keen on signing the mugshot.  You know, we're a bunch of dopes.  We're sitting here all excited, thinking it was an old-fashioned phone that they had to  rip out of the wall.  Yeah, those old, big ringing phones.  When was the last time you were in a hotel room that had one of those old-fashioned phones 
[01:04:30]  that was hardwired to the wall?  Just makes for a better story, you know?  You know what hotel?  The goddamn Tropicana in Atlantic City.  Oh, my God.  Update the place from the 1970s already.  That is the worst hotel.  It's the only one I could get.  It's the only one that had rooms available on that weekend I wanted to go.  It was after we left Washington.  Pretty last minute.  Um, I wanted to stay at the Borgata, you know?  Of course.  Kind of new.  Of course. 
[01:05:00]  I get into the Tropicana, and it's, they have a jacuzzi hot tub in the room that is  like from, it's from the 70s.  It's like one of the first ones.  There's the knobs and all kinds of instructions on the wall for it with these red light-up LED  temperature gauges.  It's, the place hasn't been updated, and the phone was a wired-in push-button old, uh,  like, brrring, telephone.  At least you had internet access, though, with high speed, right? 
[01:05:30]  There wasn't even a data port on the phone like the old hotels had for internet access.  Not even that.  I, I, I turned on my laptop and looked for any kind of Wi-Fi that might have been in the  area.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I love when they say this, too, in these hotels, which makes me, again, I love Russell  Crowe for this.  Well, sir, we have some wireless high speed in the business center, really.  Do you understand why I travel with this clunky thing, you dummy?  Would you like me to go down to the business center and pull my hog out and start jacking 
[01:06:00]  off on your equipment?  You want me to download off Joy Angels and CC log footage while I'm jacking off?  I'll be more than happy to.  You don't have a problem with that?  Yeah.  Come in.  Direct me to the business center.  Could you imagine everyone else using the business center for what it's used for?  Yeah.  You're faxing something.  You're there just answering your emails like it's no big deal.  He's downloading videos of that woman in the bathtub shitting on herself. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  Tub lady?  Tub girl?  Tub girl.  Tub girl.  John, anything else to add or what?  No, that was good.  It was the whole phone thing.  I know it's as good as thinking it was a full-size phone, but he was trying to help out Russell  Crowe because he was a nice guy that night.  Actually, it makes more sense than you're saying.  Obviously, it just seems funnier if it's a big phone and the wire's dangling as the music  being played in the elevator.  When I'll get down to that fucking lobby, he's a dead man. 
[01:07:00]  That's your motherfucker.  Is Johnson here?  No.  I actually wanted to ask him.  Anyway.  What did the guy say to him that made him throw the phone?  There must have been some interaction between them.  Had to be something.  Yeah, that's got to be on the police report.  Don't just throw the phone.  John, if you have anything else to add, please call back.  We want to know what this guy said.  Yeah.  You know he mouthed off.  Yeah, was he snotty?  Was he snide?  Did he go, well, sir, you know, give one of those hotel employee answers?  You're not supposed to remove the phone from the room, sir. 
[01:07:30]  Sir, I'll have someone come up.  Yeah.  That would really annoy you.  Sir, the phone is to stay in the room.  All right.  Now it's going to go in your face.  Well, he was on Letterman last night explaining some stuff.  Let's go to the tape.  Now, tell me all about this.  We see in the picture the newspaper had happened at a hotel.  It was four in the morning trying to call Australia.  Is that pretty much what went on there?  What was the problem?  Well, look, just now that you've given me the opportunity,  I'm extremely sorry for this whole incident. 
[01:08:00]  And I regret everything that took place.  And, you know, I've apologized to my wife.  There's not many things that scare me in this world,  but I'm absolutely terrified of disappointing her.  Right.  And your son.  You have a son now as well, right?  Yeah, little Charlie.  Thankfully, he's not old enough to quite understand what's going on.  That's good.  Apologize to your wife,  who you've done nothing but probably put in a million-dollar home.  All she's going to say is,  my husband, the Oscar winner, is an ass.  How about apologizing? 
[01:08:30]  She's fucking Russell Crowe.  Yeah.  What are you apologizing to her for?  How about the fucking guy that's...  He doesn't apologize to him.  Making 30 grand a year,  who you smash the phone in his probably deserving face.  What an ass.  That's great.  I'm sorry to the Pope and to all the people.  Shut up.  I think Nathaniel's trying to tell me he does apologize.  That's probably for you to do that.  In the second clip.  I know, but it's funny.  It is funny that he first apologized to his wife.  Well, I didn't mean to jump in there.  Let me go in there. 
[01:09:00]  Let me apologize to Danny and to Derek for having to hear that.  Let's go to Jason really fast.  Jason, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, I think Russell Crowe ought to do a live read for Vonage.  I think he could have reached out to you with that.  Yeah, Vonage would have got the job done for Russell Crowe.  Very good.  Very good tie-in to the program, sir.  Excellent tie-in.  And our advertisers.  Maybe Vonage can write up a little copy about how if you want to keep a phone from flying 
[01:09:30]  into the face of an uncut immigrant, use Vonage or something to that effect.  See, if I was working for Vonage right now, that's the angle you'd take.  Right.  That's how you get your product out there.  Instead of getting mad and throwing the phone at someone's face, why not call from your home  phone all the time?  Right.  Yeah, especially for this program.  Give us some copy that has some Russell Crowe stuff in it.  I think it's probably more effective to try to hit the immigrant in the face with the  Vonage router also than it would be that telephone. 
[01:10:00]  That's right.  You don't feel like lugging around a heavy phone.  That's good, right?  Let's go to the next clip.  Do you have trouble controlling your temper?  Um, I have, uh, yeah, I do.  Yeah.  See, I used to have the same problem.  But at the same time, I also have, in the moment, infinite patience.  You know?  So, uh, it wasn't just a thing that had come up. 
[01:10:30]  We've had nine rooms in that hotel over a period of seven days and everybody was having  the same problems and, you know, um, I, uh, you know, without getting into the detail,  the bottom line is, you know, I did something really stupid and, uh, uh, don't wish to ever  repeat that again.  And, you know, actually, while we've got the moment, you know, I, I would understand that  right at the moment that Nestor and his family would be under a great deal of pressure and  I'd like to apologize to them directly for that as well. 
[01:11:00]  These are the people involved in the incident?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, well, it's very, uh, gentlemanly of you.  Now, what will you do?  You say you regret it and you don't.  He threw a phone at a guy.  Did, did, did Letterman, first of all, who asks the tough question, this is why I love  Letterman.  Do you have trouble controlling your temper?  Way to get to the, uh, heart of the issue, Dave.  And then he asked the guy very gentlemanly of you.  I like Russell Crowe.  I, for some reason, don't like this man.  But you threw a phone in his face and you apologize. 
[01:11:30]  Is that gentlemanly and deserving applause from the audience?  No.  He got an applause break.  He did.  For his apology?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  What's the guy's, uh, name?  Probably Nestor.  Nestor.  Nestor.  Nestor.  Yuck.  With fiancee Roxanne Kramer.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Interesting.  And, uh, yeah, he's got, uh, he's on the cover of the papers, by the way, and he does  have a, looks like some kind of wound on his cheek from the telephone. 
[01:12:00]  Think he's going to be, uh, filing a lawsuit?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be worth about.  You'll definitely make a few bucks here.  I'll be worth about, uh.  A hundred G's?  Hmm.  A little more, maybe.  You think, uh, two?  Two?  Too pity.  I'm going to go quarter mil.  Quarter mil?  He's going to claim he needs some kind of plastic surgery.  And he has trouble, uh.  Getting hard-ons?  Every time a phone rings, he can't satisfy his wife sexually.  Right.  Um, he realized how awful his name is once that phone hit his face. 
[01:12:30]  Well, Russell Crowe goes on.  But they, they hold you away.  You went to the, the pokey.  They put you in jail, right?  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, um, I had some experiences that I really do not wish to ever repeat in  my life.  But, uh, you know, I tell you, you know, the NYPD were, um, you know, treating me,  very, you know, as nicely as they could in the circumstances.  Right.  And, um.  Had you ever been arrested and locked up before?  Not in the United States of America.  Yeah.  This guy's hysterical. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Well, it's very gentlemanly of you.  Well, here's the question that, uh, everyone wants to know the answer to.  Oh.  Why he needed to call so badly.  It's not just the, it's not just the simple bottom line of, I'm, you know, a tourist.  I'm a guest in, in, in your country.  I'm, you know, trying to fulfill my basic obligations to my wife who needs to know that  I'm, you know, at home.  I'm in bed.  I haven't had too much to drink. 
[01:13:30]  And that, you know, primarily important that I'm alone, you know, as these are, these  are the questions that every wife has the right to, you know, have answered every night.  And that's my, my, my duty.  So, you know, and I'm, you know, the time difference is really rough, Dave.  If I miss out on calling her at that time, then there's a 20-hour cycle before I can call  her again.  And she's going to be wondering that whole time what I'm doing and who I'm with.  And she wants to know.  Oh, okay.  I got this figured out.  It made perfect sense now.  And I would think in this case, being in prison would probably put her mind at ease. 
[01:14:00]  I got this figured out.  Anthony, I saw your face.  Yep.  This guy's a cheater.  Dang, dang, dang.  Of course, he's a womanizing, uh, mad man.  In my opinion, I think he might have been cheating.  You think?  And goes, holy crap, I forgot to call my wife.  I'm going to have to hit somebody with a phone and get arrested.  It's going to cost me $200,000 or so, but I got to hit someone now and claim that the  phone wasn't working.  Could be.  Or something similar was that he had, she had caught him cheating. 
[01:14:30]  This is a guess.  Yeah.  Maybe she caught him cheating and said, you better call me every night.  You call me right here at this time.  And you know when you have to make a phone call and the call isn't going through, the  frustration must have built up to a fever pitch with him.  And he said he had nine rooms and none of the phones were working properly.  So the whole hotel phones.  He probably ran through nine rooms to try to get, use every phone to try to call and it  didn't go through. 
[01:15:00]  Either he was cheating or if he wasn't and was actually trying to call because he's got  this arrangement with his wife that he has to call.  He must have just been freaking out like, oh my God, I'm going to get a fucking divorce  because this guy, because the phone doesn't work.  Seems like he was covering something up.  What do you mean you only had 20 hours before you could make another phone call?  When's the last time you went to call someone and said, oh, got to wait 20 hours?  20 hours.  I guess probably she does stuff.  So she's going to be away.  Please, Russell Crowe's on the phone. 
[01:15:30]  Who says I can't talk right now?  God, the Mercer Hotel could just bury Russell Crowe.  Nestor.  Just get a live news crew in there and just make the phone call and go, look, it works perfectly.  Here it is.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,  Hello?  Right.  Yeah.  So what are you thinking?  No, I don't know about cheating.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It seems like a pretty elaborate way to get out of it, but I think really he has this 
[01:16:00]  arrangement because he is a dog.  He's got this arrangement with his wife that he's got to call her and he couldn't get through  and it angered him so much because it wasn't his fault.  He wasn't cheating, but she's going to think he was, you know, that whole guilt thing.  And he'd lost his mind and had to throw the phone at this guy's face.  That was a very interesting clip.  I haven't heard that.  Very interesting.  Something was going on. 
[01:16:30]  Something.  All right.  Let's go on.  We have to come back.  Will there be a trial as a result of this?  I really don't know what happens from this point on.  And is there likely that this carries a jail sentence?  I mean, the charge was saying, oh, my God, well, you might go to jail for a longer period  of time.  Has that sunk in?  This is possibly the most shameful situation I've ever got myself in in my life.  And I've done some pretty dumb things in my life.  So to actually make a new number one is spectacularly stupid. 
[01:17:00]  Letterman's smarter than that.  Russell Crowe's not going to jail for this.  Stop it.  David, Hollywood people don't go to jail for things like this.  Don't play into that whole fear crap.  You could kill your wife and you don't go to jail.  I know.  Russell Crowe's not going to jail for this.  The only way you can go to jail, especially from doing that show, is if you're a comic  and you do an edgy joke.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And finally, from Letterman last night.  I'm just getting used to being a husband and a father away from home. 
[01:17:30]  And that level of abject loneliness I'm just not used to at all.  And, you know, if I could change this in any way, if I could turn it around, then I would  do that, you know.  And hopefully at some stage I'll be able to, you know, apologize directly to Nestor.  But at the moment he's not answering his phone.  Well, he probably doesn't want to phone anywhere near his face, dude.  He's afraid of the phone now.  You try holding up a phone to your bruised cheek. 
[01:18:00]  And as far as I'd like to make this any better, you can.  And there's a little piece of paper with numbers on it, and your signature goes to  the bottom.  Right.  That'll make everybody happy.  Paid to the order of...  All of a sudden, Nestor Estrada.  Yeah.  Two...  I got to write real small.  $250,000.  He's going to...  XXXXX100.  Yeah.  Because, you know, he's a PR.  He might take that 99 cents. 
[01:18:30]  I bet you that he's going to sue for $6 million.  He won't get it, but he's going to aim high.  No, you aim high, and then you settle on...  It won't stink.  It won't stink.  No, it won't stink.  On a lower number.  That's what I would do.  All right, let's go to infected breasts.  Yeah.  I agree.  What's up?  It's obvious he had a hot piece of ass waiting for him in the room, and he had to get this  stupid phone call with his wife over with, and he was losing his mic because he was  afraid she was going to leave, and the phone wasn't working.  Well, maybe that's it.  I'm telling you, man, there's something that was going on.  You got a chick all set up, ready to go, and all you got to do, you know, wait a minute, 
[01:19:00]  go to call the wife, and then you're trying the phone, and she's like, hurry up.  No, honey.  No, honey.  I just got here, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah, a little tired, jet lag.  Gone to sleep.  Yeah, we might go downstairs, get a little bite to eat, maybe, you know, hang out at the  bar for a little while.  Yeah.  But I'm really tired.  I'll probably be asleep in the next hour or so.  Yeah.  Just want to call and make sure that, you know, I'm here safely.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Russell!  Ha-la-la-la-la. 
[01:19:30]  Russell!  I'm waiting for you!  Yeah.  Could have been something.  You got to think something.  Something was happening.  Let's go to Chandler.  Chandler.  Chandler?  Good morning, boys.  Morning, Jimmy.  What's up?  Hey, everybody's missing out on the obvious.  Russell Crowe goes to prison and gets a phone call.  Also, do you think Banana Phone was playing when he was going down in the elevator? 
[01:20:00]  No, you're not escaping.  You're not escaping from the first sucky joke.  What was the first one?  And the second one, even worse.  I'll punch out this.  The first one.  Wait, sir, what was the first one?  Sir, what was your first joke?  Russell Crowe went to prison and got to make his phone call.  What was the second one?  Do you think that Banana Phone was playing when he was going down in the elevator?  That was his first joke?  The whole thing?  No, that was the second joke. 
[01:20:30]  But it said on the screen you want to talk about how Letterman has no balls.  Well, he doesn't.  If he had any balls, he would have brought something up that, hey, you know what?  You went to prison and you got to make a phone call.  What's the big deal?  I mean, if Letterman said that, it would have been kind of funny, I guess.  Oh.  You know.  All right, thanks.  Watch it out, guys.  Yeah, here's the other side of it.  Russ in Philly.  Russ, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, no jokes here.  Don't worry about it.  You know, you guys, listen, obvious.  A guy like this with this type of attitude probably worried about his wife cheating on him. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, maybe there's a little paranoia going the other way.  And he wanted to check up on his wife.  And he was driving him nuts.  Huh.  I like it.  There's more to this story that'll never come out.  Although she has a new kid, she's probably home.  Oh, is that why she's probably home?  Yeah.  Like she'd probably be with him.  Yeah, she had a new kid.  All right.  Let's say hi to Second Shift, the trucker.  Second Shift, what's up?  Hey, man. 
[01:21:30]  Sounds mean like Russell Crowe is a pussy whoop, man.  Yeah, it kind of does.  It sounds like he's a little pussy whoop.  Yeah, yeah, it does.  You know, oh, shit, if I don't call my wife, man, oh, hell, I'm going to have to put up with her bullshit  for the rest of my life.  Well, this guy was fucking everything in Hollywood before he got married.  This guy was banging everything.  He took, what's her name, away from Dennis Quaid.  Remember that?  Oh.  Yeah.  He was banging, oh, shit.  I can't remember her name, but I know who he's talking about, yeah.  Kathy Bates?  Meg Ryan. 
[01:22:00]  Ryan.  He was banging Meg Ryan.  I'm trying to read Nathaniel's lips, and it's like, he was married to Mel Gibson?  Meg Ryan, yeah.  He was banging her.  She was so taken by him that she left Dennis Quaid.  It's just good to know an Oscar winner has to deal with the same crap we do.  There you go.  Got to check in, you know.  He's Russell Crowe, and he still has to make the phone calls.  Check in.  Maybe he's a little paranoid that she's doing something, all that fun stuff that we get to 
[01:22:30]  deal with in our lives.  All right, thanks, second shift.  All right, man, I'm punching out.  Only when she mouths off, he could beat her with an Oscar.  Let's get a female point of view.  I'm liking the fact that more...  That was a little stronger than that.  I enjoyed it.  You know what?  I didn't even hear what you said.  And I will listen on the replay.  Listen on the replay.  I think it deserves a little twinkle.  All right, I'm going to listen on the replay, Anthony.  I did not even hear.  It was a life-beating joke.  It has to be funny.  It's mandatory on the show.  Well, he was saying that, like, something about she gets mad, because he has an Oscar,  and he'll, like, instead of the phone, he'll throw that at her, like, face or face. 
[01:23:00]  What I was going to say is I'm loving the fact that more females are participating in this show.  Uh-huh.  It's quite obvious.  Sue, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing?  Pretty good.  What do you got on this?  Listen, the first apology he made was to his wife, that he never wants to disappoint her.  Yeah.  So, clearly, he's cheating on her.  I don't know.  I think his marriage is, like, way on the line, and if you give it another three or four months, 
[01:23:30]  you're going to see it in all the tabloids.  Or it could be that when something like this happens in Hollywood, the first thing you  have to do, politicians do it, too, is you make yourself look like a dedicated family  man, because that tugs on the public's heartstrings.  You know what I mean?  I think that might be part of it, too, is let the family know you're sorry.  If you apologize to his wife in person, you don't have to do that publicly.  Oh, my God.  She's the worst pretentious ever.  I don't know myself as the gossip whore that I am.  If you look back before his marriage, he was such a womanizer.  Yeah.  And he had dated this woman before, and then they had split up and gotten back together 
[01:24:00]  and gone back and forth.  I'm telling you, you can't teach an old dog new tricks.  And I'm sorry to say it, guys, but a cheater will.  I think you're right.  If a guy is unfaithful like that and has a history of it, yeah, I don't think you change  that with just getting married, what does a piece of paper do?  That's right.  A leopard doesn't change his spots.  Wow.  That's a good one.  You make that up? 
[01:24:30]  That's a good one.  I was going to say a...  All right, Sue.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  There you go.  A lot of people want to know why he doesn't have a satellite phone, Anthony, like you have.  Yeah.  You know?  I have a satellite phone.  I don't know what Tito wants to say.  Tito in Atlanta, what's up?  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, I was wondering, when Russell Crowe got arrested and he was out in handcuffs, did  he look at the public and he goes, are you not entertained?  Punch it out. 
[01:25:00]  A little line from Gladiator.  Very nice.  Okay.  Well, enough of that.  That was pretty interesting from Letterman last night.  Whoa.  Yeah, and Eric, during the show, you know, pops up celebrities on MrSkin.com.  Uh-huh.  And he found Meg Ryan topless, and it's just horrific.  All right, now, what movie is that, and what year was it?  Well, that looks like she's a little older.  Yeah, it's in the cut, 2003.  Yeah, okay.  Those look like they were probably pretty perky back in the 80s, in the Top Gun days.  You know? 
[01:25:30]  It's just...  You got any earlier nudes of her?  What year is that?  The Doors, 1991.  Nah.  She was in that?  I'm talking 85.  Yeah, she was, uh...  Jesus, she's been around for a long time.  You forget how long Meg Ryan's been acting.  A little broad.  She's old.  Nothing before that?  A little broad prejudice against Italians.  They don't want to take their clothes off until it's, like, they're past their prime.  Always.  Always, always, these chicks.  The only one that did it right was Brooke Shields.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Jesus.  Good point, Jimmy.  Farrah Fawcett decides to finally, you know, go topless in Playboy when she was 55 years old.  Gee, thanks.  Absolutely.  Thanks for throwing us a bone, Farrah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  You don't want to see her bald head with one titty.  The next one's going to be Britney Spears.  After she has the kids, she'll finally decide she needs to be in Playboy.  She will at some point.  You watch.  Just like Debbie Gibson.  Remember her?  She posed in Playboy.  Was it Debbie Gibson or Tiffany also, right?  Tiffany did the same thing.  Okay.  Why not when they were big in the 80s? 
[01:26:30]  When they were like, you know, whatever they were.  19?  Yeah.  Something like that.  Hey, a real quick story before we go to break.  All right.  Once upon a time, there were three little bears, Opie.  The mama bear, the papa bear, and the baby bear.  I want to be the baby bear.  I'm going to sit back and listen.  I bet you do.  What happened?  Quick story that will lead to a little thing as we go to break.  What a thing?  The Cubans.  Oh, yes. 
[01:27:00]  Have you guys seen the picture of the car?  What resourceful people?  On the taxi?  They're very...  It's right there in the front.  No, go back one.  Where?  Now open the page.  There.  Where?  It's on the...  No, open that page.  Yeah.  All the way.  Now see it?  It's on the left side of the...  Now, right there.  See it?  Right there.  Atta boy.  All right.  I got you.  Fucking Dally Dooley.  It's like, it reminds me of trying to explain things to Dally Dooley.  No, Dally Dooley.  Hit the baseball. 
[01:27:30]  Hit the ball.  Well, do these guys make it?  Well, that's the trick, isn't it?  They make it, they get close, but the Coast Guard picks them up, and there's a, it's almost  like a game show, the Cubans.  There's rules to this whole thing.  If they make it to the beach, and they run up onto the beach, they can then file for citizenship  in this country.  But if they're still in the water, they turn them around and take them back. 
[01:28:00]  Right.  They take them back to Cuba and drop them off.  So the whole thing is to get to the beach.  So they make these cars, they make a boat out of a car, and pull it right onto the beach.  And that's an old 1940 taxi cab.  1949 Mercury taxi.  49 taxi.  Converted into vessel by Cuban rafters.  And they can build these things, they can make boats out of them.  They load them up with people, and they take off. 
[01:28:30]  They paint them like blue, so they're a little camouflage from helicopters.  Oh, okay.  And then they set off for America.  They were intercepted by the Coast Guard, so what does that mean?  That means they go back to Cuba.  But the other papers were saying that they made it.  The post, I think.  Really?  Yeah.  Liars, then, in the post.  Jimmy, look in the post for me.  All right.  Whoever has a post.  I don't have a post check coming up.  I don't have a post.  You know, Anthony, these were the same guys that tried doing it in the Chevy truck in 2003? 
[01:29:00]  Yes.  The 1951 Chevy truck.  You brought up a good point.  Pick up.  They got some killer old cars in Cuba in great shape.  Yeah, all the cars over there are classic cars.  They're all these old 1940s and 50s vehicles that are in really good shape.  All the classic cars are over there.  You wonder where the hell they went.  I went to Cuba one time.  My life was cool.  You did?  A birthday party up on a hotel rooftop.  For a second, I believed them.  I know.  I was with you, too.  And I'm like, why would Jimmy be in Cuba doing a gig? 
[01:29:30]  Right.  They pass around a gold telephone.  Russell Crowe threw it at some guy's face.  If you throw the phone at me, I'll know you didn't get through to Australia.  I can't find it, Opie.  All right.  No big deal.  Who cares?  Oh, no.  Anthony, what I was going to say, though.  Yeah.  Imagine a reality show.  This is a reality show I'd watch every freaking week.  You get a bunch of Cubans together with maybe different ways of trying to get to Key West 
[01:30:00]  there.  And then you set them out with a camera crew and see who makes it.  See if they make it.  And if they make it, besides getting citizenship in this country, you also give them that million  dollars.  Yeah.  You give them a lot of money.  I mean, let's start getting the real reality shows on TV.  Enough of the fake reality shit.  Last Cuban floating.  Here it is.  All right.  Third try for freedom.  The Coast Guard stopped yet another vintage American car modified into a boat and filled  with Cubans hoping to make it to America. 
[01:30:30]  It was the third car boat intercepted by the Coast Guard, and Rafael Diaz, 40, has been on  all three of them.  He needed to get out of the country, Diaz's cousin, Jesus Zamora, told WTVJTV.  He needs to get out, and this was his only chance.  I'm sure if he goes back, it isn't going to be good.  Diaz, who was with his wife and two sons, was also on board a 1951 Chevy truck.  And he also tried it in a 1959 Buick sedan, Anthony. 
[01:31:00]  And that was pulled over by the Coast Guard last year.  Pulled over.  How long does it take to go 90 miles in the water in that?  I mean, how long would you plan for a week long?  Well, if you're doing 90 miles an hour, it would take you an hour.  But it wouldn't be.  It's in the water.  Then if you're doing 45 miles an hour, it would take you two hours.  I can't split 45 and a half.  Oh, I can.  That would be 22 and a half. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, 22 and a half.  And that would take you four hours.  11 and a quarter.  What if you point the wrong way?  11 and a quarter.  That would be eight hours.  But do you roll?  You could do that.  No, they put a motor on there.  Put a motor on it.  Well, Anthony, what's this about?  Goal Pelican.  I've got to ask you something.  Goal Chevy.  Officials wouldn't say what has happened to the refugees, although under U.S. wet foot,  dry foot policy, Cubans intercepted at sea are generally returned to Cuba.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  What is the wet foot, dry foot policy, Anthony?  Well, that's what we were talking.  Wet foot, you go back.  Dry foot, you made the beach.  That means you stay.  Or at least you could file to stay if you're a criminal or something like that, and it's  not a political criminal.  What if a wave just happened to come in just as you were stepping off the boat, and it would  have been dry sand, but the wave just came by, so now it's wet sand.  I think as long as you're on the sand, you're fine.  So if you're in the water, though, and there have been people up to their waist in the water.  No.  You go back.  What? 
[01:32:30]  You go back.  They've sent people back.  What if you're up to your ankle?  Ankle?  I don't know.  It's probably a marginal call.  People that were that close to making it?  Yeah.  They were that close to making it, and they pluck them up, stick them in like a little  one of those Zodiac boats, never made it to the beach, back out to the cutter, you're  done.  That close.  You're that close.  That close.  That's got to be really...  I almost feel bad for these.  I mean, look, if you're willing to get into a car and go into a fucking ocean for 90 miles,  you really want to get to America and get out of that shithole.  But for a green car, I'll carve them up real nice. 
[01:33:00]  Another cab ride.  She's going to love me again.  I'm here.  You want to come here?  And then they...  What the Coast Guard does is they then take the Chevy, or whatever they're driving across  in, and put a few explosives in it and blow it up.  No.  They sink them.  It looks like a cool vehicle.  They should make a museum out of this stuff.  They should.  All right.  We'll play this little thing as we go to break. 
[01:33:30]  Three, two. 
[01:34:00]  Twenty cubits float on a wine bottle cork  Guantanamo Bay is just a five minute walk  But turn around, keep me down, down, down, drop you around  Keep me down, down, down, drop you around  Keep me refugees, keep me down, down, down, drop you around  Keep me down, down, down, drop you around  We took all your relatives, stay away  Remember Ricky Ricardo, Baba Louie  Look at Mamatita, she's as big as a boat 
[01:34:30]  You'd shove a motor up her ass if you thought she'd float  Turn around, down, down, down, drop you around  Keep me down, down, down, drop you around  Keep me down, down, down, drop you around  You are crazy  Keep me down, down, down, drop you around  You are crazy  Oh, oh, oh

[01:51:00]  what he is going to tell you we've met you met yeah how how how how how oh ladies please okay  he's playing to this chick audience he's doing the whole shy boy like oh i'm gonna talk about how we 
[01:51:30]  We met and fell in love.  He's playing up to this.  This isn't the action star, Tom Cruise.  This is the, look at these housewives getting damp over me, Tom Cruise.  I'm not buying it.  I'll tell you how he met.  He pulled his cock out, and he said,  Mission Impossible, born on the 4th of July, risky business.  That's how they met.  He showed his license.  She realized it really was him, and she drank out of his mule.  That's all he's ever got to do. 
[01:52:00]  That's all he's ever got to do.  Mission Impossible.  This guy doesn't have to sell himself.  I don't know.  I'm not buying it.  I don't know.  He's kind of shy.  I like him when he's shy.  Aw.  It's cute.  How?  Just how?  How?  Just how?  I admired her, and I thought that I wanted to meet her.  So I called her because I wanted to meet her.  This is bullshit.  This is all bullshit.  And this is why people say Tom Cruise is gay. 
[01:52:30]  How did you meet?  I admired her.  And I feel...  Wouldn't you go, look at her.  She's so goddamn hot, I was like, I gotta hook up with this chick.  I gotta grab those tits!  I need those tits!  Gotta squeeze her ass!  Right.  You know, that's not the first thing you say.  Oh, I admire her.  I admired her.  Fuck that.  Look the fucking ass.  I gotta grab that ass!  Admired.  Admired her?  Admired.  This is a...  This sounds like, you know, I had my publicist call up her publicist. 
[01:53:00]  That's what I wanted to say.  It's a major meeting because I have a movie coming out and I feel it's good publicity for  me to be in a relationship, even though I hate girls.  Well, that's what people say.  That's what I say.  I know.  Other DJs are apologizing for even assuming that.  So let's all be careful here.  Oh, be careful.  Come on, Sid.  We don't want to apologize like I'm just had to.  I don't do this.  I don't think he's gay.  I mean, I'm telling you, I just don't.  I think we all want him to be gay because he's the type of guy that could literally 
[01:53:30]  fuck your girl in front of you and you'd almost not get mad at her.  Hey, look, it's Tom Cruise.  I don't blame you, sweetie.  Enjoy.  Yeah, would you actually get mad at me?  I don't blame you, sweetie.  Enjoy.  Could you shut the fuck up while I'm fucking Tom Cruise?  Do you mind?  You're ruining it with your awful voice.  What would you do?  I mean...  What could you do?  He's Tom Cruise.  I'd probably just feel his cheeks and go, Jesus, those aren't nice and firm.  What if all of a sudden, you're just having me walk around New York and Brad Pitt decides 
[01:54:00]  that he just has to have your girl.  What do you do, really?  Like a predator?  Like you're a hyena and you've taken down a sickly animal and the leopard comes by and  you just got to give it up?  What do you do?  What am I going to do?  What if your chick says, look, man, I am so in love with you, but it's Brad Pitt and  it's...  I'd say, can I have a picture, Brad?  And I'd get the picture with him and I'd just kick her right over to him and I'd leave. 
[01:54:30]  That's it.  You got a picture out of it.  And nothing else can do.  You showed them.  Absolutely.  Is that a reason for a relationship, Ted?  Honey, call me when you're done.  I'll be home.  Knowing it's just a one-time thing.  I know what I would do.  Do you give that gift to your chick?  Go have fun.  Well, then you got to take one in return, right?  Oh, yeah.  Is that like the deal?  Oh, yeah.  We have to consider the 80 you've taken that she doesn't know about?  That's what the...  That's what I would have to do.  Well, there was Craigslist. 
[01:55:00]  That's why people always have those...  And there was a whole string of it on one of the message boards.  They have that your fantasy get one free from your spouse or mate thing where, you know,  oh, if you could have sex with anybody, who would it be?  Your fantasy one.  You know, the freebie that you'd give.  And because it'll never happen, you know, you allow each other to pick that person.  It would be Tom Cruise.  Oh, okay. 
[01:55:30]  I get to pick one now?  The neighbor.  Girl next door.  Hey, you didn't say it had to be a celebrity.  You're fucking her.  You said it's okay.  Now go get Tom Cruise, bitch.  You know, I was going to...  I was going to...  Just because I aimed low ain't my problem.  Damn it.  You beat me to it.  I was going to take your angle, but you aim real low in the celebrity world where it is possible. 
[01:56:00]  Fuck the celebrity.  Fuck even getting in your car.  Hello?  Hello?  My wife said I could fuck you.  Well, let's think of some fat chick so you know you're getting fucked.  Right.  Well, let's think of some celebrities out there that are just, you know, have nothing happening anymore  where they're actually obtainable.  Kevin Retray.  Mindy Cohen.  Right.  From Back to Life.  The fat chick from Back to Life.  Who couldn't fuck her?  Yeah.  Your chick just goes, you know, Brad Pitt. 
[01:56:30]  They're like, Mindy Cohen.  They got her fucking phone number.  I'll be fucking her tomorrow.  You make her hum the song while she's blowing you?  It's like that.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  There you go.  All right.  Hey, good luck with Brad Pitt, sweetie.  Yeah.  I'm going to fuck this pig.  And she's going to be happy about it. 
[01:57:00]  And while you're at it, get Blair's cousin Jerry in here to tickle my balls.  What is this, her eating before you fucker?  Yeah.  You like that, don't you?  Remember you talking about the one with CP or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a great addition for the cast.  Yeah.  That's what I'm going to call.  You definitely get her.  That's funny.  It's like that old kids game where you see who could punch the lightest and you let the other guy go first. 
[01:57:30]  That's what you do.  You go first.  You let your chick go first.  She'll pick Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise or one of these other idiots.  And then you aim real low.  And then wham.  That is really funny.  Aim low.  You're banging the grandmother that lives next door.  Oh, wow.  Let's see.  I think another celebrity you could really get in there with.  You nailed it, Ant.  That's the bit right there.  That's the one right there.  Tony and Rockaway, what's up? 
[01:58:00]  Is she alive still?  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi, fella.  All right.  I'm out at Wynn's premiere a couple of months ago when they opened up the hotel and my worst nightmare came true.  We saw an entourage of people and this little midget.  And my wife was like, oh, I think that that's Tom Cruise.  So I'm like, that's not Tom Cruise.  She drags me over like a puppy to meet Tom Cruise.  And I'm standing there.  Might as well cut my balls off.  And she's sitting there like, hi, Tom. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, I'm a great guy.  And I just sat there like a fucking idiot.  And now every day, I swear to God, she doesn't look at me the same way.  It was really him?  Yeah, it was really him.  He had about ten people around him.  And, you know, that chick is a piece of ass.  But, you know, she's 20 years younger than him.  So she should be.  Dude, the same thing happened to you that happened to me.  But it happened with Tom Cruise in your case.  I mean, just imagine being mean.  It was a stupid drummer from a band that had one hit.  She was all gushing. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, like you wouldn't believe.  It was the worst.  I could almost relay like, well, it's Tom Cruise.  What are you going to do?  But some douche that's in a band that's never going to make it?  How about the room cost me 400 bucks.  And I know that night when we were fucking, she was thinking I was Tom Cruise.  Oh, man.  I'm punching out.  How are we going?  Hey, good phone call.  Turn the lights out.  I'm going to call you Maverick.  Good point.  Because what else is she thinking about the whole time she's out there?  Devin says Tracy Gold would be another one. 
[01:59:30]  Probably fuck Tracy Gold.  Who's that?  Yeah, she was from.  Well, she was anorexic and then she was in that.  Then she was in that.  Growing Pans.  And then she was in a DWI accident with her family.  Wilson Phillips.  That's the role I'd probably take.  Wilson Phillips just had a kid.  Victoria Jackson.  Well, Wilson Phillips is the whole band.  Which one?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Corny.  Jesus.  Corny.  No, not even Corny.  Wilson Phillips.  I know.  Jesus.  Who do you want to fuck? 
[02:00:00]  Fleetwood Mac.  Right.  I like her.  Let's get back to the audio, Anthony.  It's just, you see someone's work and you hear about them and you hear from people what  a special person she is.  And I help a lot of people.  A lot of people call me for advice on career and life.  And there's, you know, I'm kind of known for that.  What?  Yeah, and I'm sure you're taking all those phone calls.  What are you talking about?  You're known for that.  He's known for, what is? 
[02:00:30]  Man, is he just a babbling space cadet.  Here's what people do.  People want to call Tom Cruise just to say I'm calling Tom Cruise.  So you tap into someone's ego.  Hey, Tom, I need your advice.  Well, I'd be happy to help.  You know, people feel important when they can give you advice.  That's why they call Tom Cruise.  Yeah.  I'm known for that.  And so I just, I meet with people and I wanted to meet this, this woman and, uh, and I met  her and she's.  Okay.  I met her.  You met her.  Yes.  Extraordinary. 
[02:01:00]  She's truly, she's.  Oh my God.  All those, uh, stupid women in the audience.  Oh, why could it be me?  I saw her.  I thought she was really beautiful.  She's talented too.  I'm like, I have to meet her.  So I called her rep and met her.  Why, why not just say it like that?  She's extraordinary.  People call me for, shut up.  How do you know?  She's extraordinary.  Yeah.  Extraordinary.  At that point.  He's using all words that no heterosexual guy uses for a hot chick.  But here, you know, here's the deal. 
[02:01:30]  It's really simple.  When you start going out with someone new, you're attracted to them because of their physical  beauty.  There you go.  That's the first line.  You're not starting to think that she's extraordinary and I admire her and stuff.  That's stuff you hope happens after the physical attraction hits you.  You hope that she's not a zero.  Your first thought is, I got to feel the tits.  Of course it is.  I need that ass.  And he gave himself away too and she's like, what made you like her?  And he goes, well, it's like they said in Rent.  No.  Wow.  Holy.  Oh, my God. 
[02:02:00]  Charger.  It's Charger.  Game play reference.  We get a nice chuckle.  I thought it correctly.  Jerry, cousin Jerry from the Facts of Life.  Yes.  With cerebral palsy.  Yeah.  She is the gimp in Deadwood.  She's actually got a role in Deadwood.  You watch Deadwood?  Anyone?  I should.  Yeah.  I hear it's a great show.  She's the one that she has a cerebral palsy in Deadwood.  That's nice.  But it's like a pretty good role she's got there.  I'm sure she's terrific.  Did you just hear what I said? 
[02:02:30]  Amazing.  No.  Nothing.  All I could add to that was, I hear it's a good show.  I hear it's a good show.  I should watch it.  I should watch it.  That's what I had in Deadwood.  Jesus.  Yeah, Deadwood.  I've never seen you like that.  I've never seen that.  I know.  I knew you did.  And I thought, you know what?  I thought.  What happened to you?  I have to tell you.  No, when you meet someone that's like, you go, huh?  And there's so much that we have in common. 
[02:03:00]  And I just thought, I can't be cool.  You know what I mean?  I can't be laid back.  I just, it's something that has happened.  And I feel I want to celebrate it.  And it's something that I want to celebrate her.  She's a very special.  Celebrate her.  She's a very special woman.  And you're going to, I'm sure you know her.  You're going to get to know her even more.  She's really.  Throw her out. 
[02:03:30]  Heckler.  Wow.  All right.  Let's.  A lot better heckler than I get.  At least I'm not yelling monster rain at him.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Detroit.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, you guys are just missing, man.  All that Tom wants is to get Dawson's number from her.  He's gunning for the Dawson.  That's funny.  Check it out, boys.  All right.  Very good, Jeff.  Uh, let's see, uh, Kerplunk Connor from Jersey. 
[02:04:00]  Very funny name.  He thinks, uh, you could probably bang Holly from Land of the Lost.  Remember, uh, Holly, the, the younger sister from Land of the Lost?  Yeah.  That show?  Yeah.  Definitely.  Okay.  Let's go to Rob in Alabama.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, uh, uh, a couple months back, I took my wife's shopping over in New Orleans.  And I ran into Jessica Simpson in this little boutique.  So, you know, I'm old and fat, but I figured, hey, I'll give it a shot. 
[02:04:30]  I didn't want to be shopping anyway.  So my wife sees me talking to Jessica Simpson.  It's over for the next month.  Every time I try to touch my wife, it's, I bet you're thinking of Jessica Simpson's boobies.  I bet you're thinking of Jessica Simpson.  Boobies.  I was, but that's not the point.  Did she say boobies, sir?  Did she say boobies?  It is Alabama, probably.  They were very nice boobies.  You should have seen them.  But your wife gave you shit because you met Jessica Simpson?  Ah.  Well, because I was trying to pick up on her, but I think she was just being nice because, 
[02:05:00]  you know, I'm not bad.  Rob, why are you lying?  You weren't trying to, you didn't think you were going to try her.  You weren't trying to get action from Jessica Simpson?  We were just chatting with her.  You got to take your shots when you can take your shots.  I'm never going to get that shot again.  I mean, what the hell?  All right.  Trying to pick up on her.  No, what would you possibly say to her?  Hi.  Love your shot.  Maybe you want to go to a movie?  Yeah, you know, maybe I was thinking, you know, maybe sometime, if you're not busy, we go out.  Let's go to Zeno.  Zeno.  Hey, Opa.  So she's, you know, mounting over a drummer. 
[02:05:30]  Weren't you jerking off the NASCAR?  Well, my ex liked the drummer of the Nixons.  I made it perfectly clear in front of me, and I jerked off to NASCAR.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  That was a great story, but I was whacking to porn, and someone decided they couldn't  sleep in the middle of the night and came downstairs, and I had to quickly change the channel.  I was hungry.  I came down to get something to eat.  And all of a sudden, I just quickly hit whatever. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, I went back to regular TV, and there was a NASCAR race on.  And you would never be watching NASCAR, so your chick is like suspicious.  And stupid me, I hit the remote really fast, and then threw it on the coffee table, making  believe I was just watching this the whole time, and there's NASCAR going around the  track, and I'm under a blanket, and I can't move.  And, yeah, it was a very uncomfortable situation, because it was very obvious at that point what  was going on.  Gee.  Yeah.  All right, another clip from Oprah.  Katie once told 17 Magazine that her dream was to marry Tom Cruise. 
[02:06:30]  So, you know, I've been in the dream-making business this year.  Are you in the dream-making business?  Oh, are you?  I'm going to pop the question.  I don't want to disappoint her.  Oh, my God.  The Beatles!  Ladies and gentlemen, the Beatles!  I have to say to her, personally, but, you know. 
[02:07:00]  So...  She's listening, I...  Tom, does that mean you're going to ask her to marry you?  Does that mean you're going to ask her to marry you, Tom?  They are cackling and howling.  Oh, my God.  The relationship's a month old, right?  That's how they are in Hollywood. 
[02:07:30]  Two months, maybe?  All of his immigrants' kids will have 20 mothers.  Somewhere in there.  He was jumping around on the couch.  Who cares?  Who even, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Well, Craig has a good question.  The audience is the worst.  In Tennessee.  Craig, go ahead.  I was just wondering if his, uh, fun shirt turned periwinkle blue when he was talking about  this.  Was he wearing a periwinkle shirt?  What faggots would wear periwinkle?  Periwinkle.  I love the callbacks on this program.  Will in D.C., what's up, Will? 
[02:08:00]  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey, what's up, sweet tits?  Hey.  My celebrity that I want to fucking...  I actually had this conversation with my girlfriend already.  Um, you guys are a little older than me, so you might not be with it, but, uh, the girl  that played Stephanie Tanner on Full House, name's Jody Sweetin, hot as shit.  Jesus, the girl was like eight years old on the show.  Yeah, I know, but she's like 25 now, and I swear to God, if you look up pictures of her,  go to Google and put her name in.  She is hot as shit right now.  All right, let me take a look.  I'm always willing to, uh, see if, uh, little girl turned out hot. 
[02:08:30]  Yes.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, is that spelt with a E-N or an C-C-O?  It's, uh, S-W-E-E-T-I-N, I think.  Yeah.  What?  E-E-I-N.  No, no, no, it's E-Y.  E-Y.  E-Y.  No, E-T-Y.  There's no, it's not coming up any matches.  I told you, it's E-Y.  How do you spell that bitch's name?  He told you.  Last name S-W-E-E-T-I-N.  Yeah.  S-W-E-E-T-I-N.  Right.  J-O-D-I? 
[02:09:00]  No, why?  What?  Fuck her first name.  You don't need her first name.  E-Y.  You don't need her first name?  Shouldn't.  No, you shouldn't need her first name, right?  Not that hurt.  I wouldn't say hot.  Dude, you're a sick man.  Seek help.  I can't find any up-to-date, I find a picture of her when she's like five.  What are you, insane?  I'm trying to find a picture of her.  I'll post on the forums, you'll see.

Oh  People were still maybe a little drunk  Yeah  On the West Coast  It was still nighttime  We definitely got some West Coast action on that 
[02:16:00]  You're right  So perhaps our changing times might have  Nah  There's morning sex going on all over the joint  Yeah  All over the place  All right, Anthony  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie  We're a regular little gossip show today  Well, just today  We go in stages  And spurts  Just seems like there's a lot of this stuff out there  So why not cover it?  Front page news  Front page news  It gives us fodder to go off on some weird tangents  Hmm  That's all we're looking for on this show 
[02:16:30]  Bring us material and we'll make shit up  That's it  That's what we do  That's what we do now  It might just sound like a dumb Brad Pitt, Angelina story  But you never know  You never know  One never know  All of a sudden, you know, the last  We went from Tom Cruise to Anthony Bang  And the fat chick from Facts of Life  See how this works?  That doesn't sound good at all  Well, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie  May have checked into L.A.'s W. Westwood Hotel  As Mr. and Mrs. Smith  Oh, that's the movie name 
[02:17:00]  I wonder if they did  After they attended the movie's nearby premiere Tuesday night  An eyewitness saw the photogenic couple in a room 816  And as our spy was leaving yesterday morning  The couple was  You stay at a room 816  I really wish they were in room 237  To get out of the tub all old and drowned  And he backed out frightened  Yeah, he did  And as our spy was leaving yesterday morning 
[02:17:30]  The couple was wearing bathrobes  As room service delivered their breakfast  They both have AIDS?  Oh, well  One was brought into a barbershop across the street  Are they all full of pills?  Are they banging or not, Anthony?  Let's go around the room  No  What?  I say no  This is another publicity thing  This is a publicity  The stunt  Mr. and Mrs. Smith 
[02:18:00]  They checked in under Mr. and Mrs. Smith  There's a publicist behind all this stuff  They're eating this up  They love it  Movie coming out  And they're getting this kind of press  I don't think they're banging them  Put on robes  Put on robes when room service comes  Yeah, room service will come  Look, we have this idea  You know how that shit works  We have an idea  After the premiere  You two  We've already reserved a room  Over at the W  Go over there 
[02:18:30]  Sign in under Mr. and Mrs. Smith  Because then that's the name of the movie  And then  Of course we have your room set up  Different rooms  Under different names  That you'll go to and actually sleep in  But in the morning  We're going to have you go into the one room  And then come out  For room service  In your bathrobes  Oh, this is going to be great  Oh, you nailed it  That's what they do  If they were fucking  You probably wouldn't even hear about it  Wouldn't make this much of a fuss over it 
[02:19:00]  I know  Making sure there's eyewitnesses  An eyewitness?  It's another publicist  Or somebody that the publicist tipped off  That they know talks to the press  It's all set up  Alright, you nailed it  I want to be linked to a pretty girl like that  Just so the neighbors can take a picture of me and Angelina on the beach  Who is this fat pig?  You know, that's the worst thing about  If you were just a regular guy  Going out with one of these hot Hollywood chicks 
[02:19:30]  You'd think it would be like the Brad Pitt story  Where they'd be taking pictures  Ooh, what are they doing?  Here they are on the beach  It would just be a story about  What is this slob doing with this gorgeous woman?  And it would be every bad picture of you  With her  And just bashing you constantly  I'd wear Speedos all over the place  With my rotten gut  And my appendix scar  And she could just dote on me  And touch my stomach  That would be a great picture  On the beach  Her laid out in the sun  With a knee up maybe 
[02:20:00]  Just kind of basking in the sunlight  And you in a Speedo  With your hands on your hips  Squinting  Like just looking up somewhere  Squinting  Huh?  Like you're like  Huh?  Us checking in at hotels  Me like always looking at a pair of shorts  With no socks  And an open like Hawaiian shirt  And she has to carry the bags  She is carrying the bags?  I carry nothing  You got a cup of coffee in your hand?  I don't tip  I walk through the door  I bark orders at her  Come on with the bags! 
[02:20:30]  What great pictures  This would make, man  Just a cup of coffee  You're walking like  Five steps ahead of her  Yeah  She's hustling the bags in there  Like De Niro  When he's walking down the street  To beat Joe Pesci in Raging Bull  That type of an outfit  With the awful shorts  Maybe the high socks  The open shirt  The gut  Black socks  Oh, Angelina's always looking hot  She always has her makeup  She's always carrying the bags  You just suck 
[02:21:00]  That's really funny  That would be the greatest  Publicity thing ever  It would be fantastic  Well, Anthony  Everyone is talking about  Brad Pitt on Primetime Live  With Diane Sawyer  Did huge ratings  Yes  Absolute  Certainly did  Huge ratings  So let's play a couple of these clips  Really fast  They're short ones  I think it's ambitious  But I think it can't  Okay, this is about  Oh, you're going to preface it  With some explanation  As to what he said, Wolfie?  Well, I kind of listened  To what you said yesterday, Anthony  I learn every day on the show  Instead of just throwing this crap out there  I'm thinking maybe we should set some of this up 
[02:21:30]  Like a real show  Like a real show  We want to be like a real show sometimes  That's our goal  Well, just every once in a while  Occasionally it should be like a real radio show  Brad Pitt talking about ending poverty, Anthony  What?  I think it's ambitious  But I think it can be done  We have the potential  To end poverty in our time  We could be that generation  We could be living in that era  Man, what is more exciting than that?  The potential's there  We could 
[02:22:00]  Gotta go for it  Gotta go for it, man  We gotta go for it  What's more exciting than that?  Angelina with her face in a pillow  And her asshole wide open  That would probably take a little bit of a priority  On the excitement list  Two words, Angelina  Gaping  Yeah  Wow  You see, when he entered the room  That would have been a great story  When the room service came  She's on her face  And there's lard by the bed  And her ass is in the air  And he enters with a fistful of lard  Can I help you? 
[02:22:30]  No, but her hands are tied behind her back  And her ass is up in the air  I think poverty would take a back seat to that, huh?  Absolutely  He tips with lard cake hands  I'm an intense spot hole greasy  Lard  No explanation  Your one shirt sleeve is rolled up 
[02:23:00]  See, that's  Proven at Hollywood  These guys just don't have a sense of humor  Because like Anthony  Anthony set up the whole scene with the publicist  You know, setting up these things  There's got to be one guy in Hollywood  That goes, what the hell  Let's really throw this over the top  This setting up scene  Go out and get a tub of Crisco  Right  You  You're going to be tied to the bed face down  Can you whimper?  Brad, let's spread the lard on your arm  Up to the elbow  Oh, man 
[02:23:30]  That's a good one  He answers  And he's got like the lard  Those shirts he rolled up  And a clothespin on his nose  Room service  Oh, pardon me  Just keep this under your hat  That's classic  Well, he wants to end poverty  End poverty  What a kook this guy is  Doesn't he make 50 million a film?  Why, you know  Why doesn't he do a movie for free  And take that money 
[02:24:00]  And throw it at those sons of bitches  Does he think  That there are  Eight impoverished people in the world?  Eight?  That you could just dole a few bucks out  And the problem is solved  Does he understand how  How  How  Huge poverty is?  And it's going to be ended  In this generation  It could be  No, it won't  There's been poverty  For  Since there's been people  And there will always be poverty  That's it  Stop it 
[02:24:30]  I just can't get the image  Out of my head  How  Brad Pitt  The  Fish full of lard  Tipping  What I tell you guys  See, the Brad Jolie thing  Sounded boring  Going into it  But now look  Now look  Now look what you got  To take home with you  He's tipping with a lard hand  Lard  Where do you get lard?  Such a great word  What do I get?  I live with it  Under my shirt  Oh, well 
[02:25:00]  Let's get back to these clips  With Diane Sawyer  All right  He wants to end poverty, Anthony  He's asking others  To join him  In a nationwide movement  Called the One Campaign  Its purpose  Convince Americans  There are solutions  Ways to end poverty  In Africa  One by one  And impossibly  The campaign  Has united  Hollywood liberals  And Christian conservatives  Pat Robertson  Yeah, it's fantastic  In there  Yeah 
[02:25:30]  Aren't we tired  Of these dividing lines  That separate us  What is his  Common denominator?  Common denominator  Something can be done  In ten years  We could half extreme poverty  We could cut it in half  In twenty years  We could end it  And what was it  You saw that you could do?  I guess shine  Some kind of light on this  I mean, I can't get out  Of the press  These people can't get in the press  So let's redirect  The attention a little bit  If you start fucking  Some you bangy women  That'll get them 
[02:26:00]  In the press  Yeah, by the way  I am tired of those lines  That divide us  The guys that can fuck Angelina  And the guys that can't  Oh, they are so delusional  I mean, you don't hear  About hungry people  In the press  You're right  You never hear about them  You know, we are the world  Never  Yeah, we are the world  Couldn't get the job done  I don't think Brad Pitt can  What you see is these  Fucking starving people  With stupid baskets on their heads  We get it  You're hungry  You want to end poverty  Start handing out condoms  Lots and lots of condoms  Exactly 
[02:26:30]  Rewinding a little bit, Anthony  You know, the lord in the hand  Of course  Answering the door  Freddie B makes a good point  From Philly  It's like the scene of Fight Club  When he answers the door naked  With the kitchen gloves on  I never saw Fight Club  Oh, God  Fight Club's a great movie  You never see Fight Club  God  I was always against Edward Norton  No  Why?  Because of your name?  No  I just never  I like him now  I don't just like him now  You don't think he's a good actor?  I didn't  American History X?  I think he's really good  I thought that was a good movie  Oh, my God  He was amazing  What about the first movie he was in?  That one where 
[02:27:00]  Primal Fear  You didn't like that?  You didn't like Primal Fear?  I was not impressed at all  I thought he was very good in that  It was kind of what made him a star  I know  That's why I kind of resented him  I did like him a lot  I just didn't like the movie  I liked him a lot in the Brando film  With Robert De Niro and Brando  Were They Steal?  Yeah  What's that?  Shit  Where he played the retarded guy?  Yeah, he played the retarded guy  Who was faking it  That was good  That's another role  Where you're kind of just  Playing a retard  American History X was good  That was really good  I thought that was another  Really, really good movie  Although the director one time 
[02:27:30]  Tony K  Was at the comedy cellar  Yeah  So I asked him to sign an autograph  I was too embarrassed to ask him  I'm like  You know, it's for my kids someday  So he signed an autograph  To Jim's kids  Are you kidding?  No  What a tool I was  The score  That's what it was called  The score  I don't mind  Look, when artists are doing stuff  To help starving people  I got no problem with that  Because that's not really  A political agenda  Yeah, that's true  That's fine  It's like  Who are we to judge?  Yeah, I know  We really are dicks  Look at him trying to feed the hungry  Look at him  I just think he's, you know 
[02:28:00]  Delusional  Yeah  That's all  One by one  There's fucking  There's about 12 million of them  Well  Yeah  How about a group by group?  Here we go  Diane Sawyer asking Brad Pitt  Why we should listen to celebrities  The Hutu had a good idea  To rid the tootsies  That might cut the problem in half  Yeah  Cut a few tootsies in half  Go over to the sedan  They have some solutions  They have solutions for having the problem  With a machete  Yes, sir  We've got to go to the phone first  Joe, go ahead 
[02:28:30]  Hey, guys  Hey  I just got in the car  My XM was on  One of the other stations  And that Bruce Kelly dude  Just comes on  I just asked  Here's my morning dedication  To Opie and Anthony  He's playing  The Pet Shop Boys  What have I done?  What?  I like  What?  Actually  I'm fucking Bruce  Actually, if you know the lyrics  It's kind of funny  Because I think it's  What have I done to deserve this, right?  Is it?  Yeah  Alright  That is funny  Wow  See 
[02:29:00]  I don't want to admit this  But I sort of like the guy  I know  Because he gets it  He gets it  Oh, okay  So as long as he's like  Not busting on you guys  Nah, we're friends  You know, honestly  I don't even care if he busts on us  That's the truth  Let me hear a little of that  Alright, here's the song  He dedicated to us this morning  Yeah  That's the Pet Shop Boys  Alright  Ah, enough of the intro 
[02:29:30]  Long 80s intros  Is the thing to do  Don't have a long intro  If you have nothing special  In the intro  You know what I mean?  Yeah  Ah  Ah  Ah  Come on  Here I come  Right now  Ah  More intro?  More intro  Boy, this song stinks already  You always wanna love us  What?  Ew  Jesus, Bruce  You always wanna jump  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah 
[02:30:00]  As I was  What's wrong with the band  How am I gonna get through  How am I gonna get through  I could be looking for my knees  Oh, this is the musical answer  To Periwinkle  Get to the hook already  Jesus  Now you love me with the band  Can't do that  How am I gonna get through  How am I gonna get through 
[02:30:30]  I've brought you drinks  I've brought you flowers  I've read you books  And told the hours  Every day  So many drinks  Such pretty flowers  Tell me  What have I  What have I  What have I done to deserve this  What have I  What have I  What have I done to deserve this  All right, enough  I wear my pants  Up to my nipples  All right, that's good  Pet shop boys  Make the human league  Sound like Sabbath  But faggots  That is a gay song 
[02:31:00]  See, this is the beauty of the show  Now we get to talk about this  For a little while  When you were growing up  On Long Island  Listening to New Wave, right  Because it was the thing to do  I mean, in the 80s, you know  Listen to it  Did you have any idea  These bands were so overly gay?  Like, a couple of them, yeah  Listening to that song  You know, I remember hearing that song  Back in the day  Thinking nothing of it  But now that I'm older and wiser  I'm like, oh my god  Well, I never heard that one  I heard the East End Boys  West End Girls song  That they did  Right, right  I never heard that one  And, you know, that was pretty gay, too 
[02:31:30]  But not quite that gay  That's pretty gay  What about Frankie Goes to Hollywood?  That everyone knew was gay  Relax  Don't do it  Ay, ay, ay, ay  That gay  Of course, boy George  Everyone knew  Gay, gay, gay  Yeah, everyone knew George O'Dowd  Was a homosexual  Again, knows the name  I couldn't even have told you that again  Of course  Even though you told me last week  I'll tumble for you  Is a good number  I'll tumble for you  Says a lot  And you'll tumble for a man 
[02:32:00]  Speaks volumes  It certainly does  Because Dana Reeves said to her husband  What are you going to do for me?  I'll tumble for you  Tumble for you  Jesus, we got it  You're right  I didn't get the laugh  I wanted someone  You didn't need to go there  You didn't need  Alright, whatever  Okay, let's  Why we should listen to celebrities  See, now we're back at this  This is what we do  We kind of veer off a little  But always come back  It's a new way we do our show  We go off on all sorts of  Kind of tangents and stuff 
[02:32:30]  But we get back on the highway  Every once in a while  Why should we listen to celebrities?  I don't know that we should  I'm very uncomfortable with this  I'm not comfortable  Even sitting here today  I'm sweating like a pig  I don't believe people should listen to me  I'm hoping the images  Will speak for themselves  What is his speech impediment?  It's probably just a little nervous  No, there's something going on there  He's not a bright man  Every time I've heard him  He's really not known to be a bright man  Every time I've heard him speak  There's something going on 
[02:33:00]  What is it?  Well, like  I don't  He says  Very  Instead of very  I heard him say butt once  When he said  He butt his penis  In Angelina Jolie  Well, like Pacino  Can't say his R's properly  Sometimes he can go  There's something really  He has a  Maybe it's something like that  That's kind of  It bothers you  But you don't know exactly  Was that before or after  The cop punched him in the mouth?  A little tool for my job  Too cranky  All right  Here 
[02:33:30]  Hold him up  People are misguided, Anthony  How's the Italian food here?  People are misguided  Yeah  Your Google  Is up to now  2.7 million entries  I don't even know  How to respond to that  It's a strange focus  Isn't it?  That my  Relationships  Or relationship mishaps  Or  It takes precedent  Over  Something like that  Listen, I understand  It's about entertainment  But man, it's  It's misguided a bit 
[02:34:00]  Isn't it?  He's so dramatic  Wait, what was he talking about there?

This is an entertainment show  And what people want  To know about  More than  A curing world hunger  Is your marriage  And why it ended  Right  I'm sorry  But that is the  Cold hard facts of life here  And these celebrities  More people care about  His fucking stupid marriage  Than world hunger  And these celebrities 
[02:37:00]  Just went it one way  I mean  Yeah  They put the celebrity  Marriage out there  And now it's ended  So there's a lot of  Interest in that  Well why did it end?  You know you showed us  How happy you guys were  Over the years  And these pictures  And that  What happened?  I don't see  My time  Certainly my marriage  Is any kind of failure  It was  Our time  Mr. Hand  An extraordinary time  You quoted someone saying  Things just take  Different shapes 
[02:37:30]  And it doesn't mean  The original shape  Yeah it doesn't mean  You lose the love  It's just  From the shape  Of Jennifer Aniston  To the shape  Of Angelina Jolie  Reported everywhere  That you wanted babies  And she did not  Ridiculous  Ridiculous  A pretend cough  Masking an expletive  What?  Completely fabric  Wow what happened there?  Is he cursed?  He probably said bullshit  What did he say?  Did he say bullshit?  Is he pulling an old  Bluto Blutarski 
[02:38:00]  Yeah  Bluto Blutarski  Delta House bit  Yeah so  He did that old bit  Where you cover up  The swear with the cough  Bulldog  But he did it enough  Eat me  They couldn't even  Have all of it in there  So  Oh so that's just  So they just have him  Saying bull S  And then they  And then Diane  Cora cuts in  Let's hear it again  That's ridiculous  A pretend cough  Bull

[02:39:00]  To have something  He doesn't  Yeah  A pretend cough  Masking an expletive  Completely fabricated  You know what you'll find  With these stories  Is they usually  Will turn one of us  Into the good guy  And one of us  Into the bad guy  If you look at it  Closely  Or even not that closely  And  It's ridiculous  Most of these stories  You get  Probably 2%  Real fruit juice  And the rest is  Just garbage  With no nutritional value 
[02:39:30]  Alright  A little analogy there  He's a king of analogies  A little high C analogy  Yeah  Kool-Aid  The Kool-Aid analogy  Yeah  This next clip  Something was a brave decision  What  You don't know  How would you work it  Into a  A preface  For the clip though  Well if this was  A real radio show  I would  You'd say something like  I would get more  And Brad talks about  A brave decision  Right  Like I don't know 
[02:40:00]  What it is  But fuck it  Brad speaks about  A brave decision  He made  Right  Concerning  But all I got  Is  I don't know  He did something  And it was a brave decision  He did something  Do you really want  To have a real radio show  No  Okay  As far as I know  We get one shot  At this thing  One time around  And it  Better be everything  You want it to be  I mean it's up to you  To make that  And  That's it  That's it 
[02:40:30]  I actually think  It was a really  Brave  Conscious  Conscientious decision  On our part  I mean we'll see  Splitting up  Is that what he talked about  Getting a divorce  Yeah  Yeah  Being brave enough  To know that  The relationship  Was over  Yeah  That is brave  And that there was  Hotter tail out there  Yeah  That needed to be explored  Fistful of lard  That is brave though  When you're Brad Pitt  To like  To risk not meeting a girl  I know 
[02:41:00]  That's pretty brave  No  Yeah  It would be brave  If it happened to Jim Norton  Yeah  Whenever I tell a girl  It's balls  When John Madden  Leaves a relationship  It's brave  Yeah  That is a good point  Yeah  That's real brave  Like they're not just  Lining up  And  Brad Pitt could just  Go out and go  I'm gonna see  How many girls  I can fuck tonight  Just gonna see  How many  I'm gonna try to  Set my all time record  How many different  Smells I can get  On my bag  Right  One evening  Yeah  Yeah  He's such a brave  Brave man  That's brave  He's brave 
[02:41:30]  We got to  We are really sad  In this room though  Just bashing him  We should be though  Just bashing him  Because he's  He's good looking  Yeah but we're honest  And he's not  At least we expose ourselves  And embarrass ourselves  And don't hide  We have to be though  Understandable  It's part of the personality  That has to outshine  That has to outshine  These good looking guys  I understand it  We're chimps  Believe me  I don't know what we do  Is to make up for the fact  That we don't have  Full juicy kissable lips  Fucking bread  Sure 
[02:42:00]  It still makes me sick though  Alright  She and Pitt  Working together  For the first time  When you first  Met her  What were you expecting  I mean  Had you read all the stuff  The tattoos  The blood  And the bile  He won't comment  But describes Jolie  As not what the publicity  Leads us to think  No  Well I have great respect for her  She's a good egg  And a great actor  And I admire what she's  What she's doing  Admired again  The UN work  Admired  So let me try 
[02:42:30]  Some of these questions  Alright  Let's go  Personal questions  Which I abhor  Did Angelina Jolie  Break up your marriage?  No  I handle this like a game show  No  Everyone says  She's a home wrecker  It's a good story  You know  I've been in these tablets  For 14 years now  At some point  You just become  The zen master  Of it all  Wow  She used the oldest  Trick in media  Everyone is saying  Everyone is saying 
[02:43:00]  Really Diane  Name a few people  Sourceless  Right  That is just the way  Everyone is saying  The media can put things  Without ever having to come up  With who it was  Everyone is saying  Everyone is saying  People are saying  Right  I didn't say it  Fox News does all the time  People are saying  That doesn't make it news  No  Because people are saying  But then they could report it  And it's not their opinion  It's not their question  People are saying  Everyone is saying  Everyone is saying  If Brad Pitt abhors personal questions  Understandable  Don't do an interview 
[02:43:30]  With Diane Sawyer  Right  Just don't do it  What's status now?  That's what we're going to find out here  What's status now?  What's status now?  Is that the preface to that one?  Yeah  You want to guess?  What's status now?  His relationship with one of the chicks there  Alright  I'll go with Angelina Jolie  Angelina Jolie  And just to make it interesting  You go with Jennifer Aniston 
[02:44:00]  Jennifer Aniston  No  Because I know they have broken up  I'm going to say Angelina Jolie  But that doesn't make for interesting radio  Because then one of us can say  See I was right  And the other guy  Damn it  So you go with Jennifer Aniston  Alright  I'll go with Jennifer Aniston  Alright  And you'll go with  Angelina Jolie  Jimmy  I'm going to take Kim Fields  Alright  So what kind of relationship is this now?  Are they officially together?  We give it a try  There's a lot still to put in place 
[02:44:30]  I don't know what the future is just yet  There's still things that have to, I guess, be answered for me individually  Are you going to be able to keep this up?  Not talking?  Not talking about it?  Well, it's more that there's not so much to talk about at this time  Lord  If there is, I will  Well, there's a couple things that are going on here, right?  One, they're not talking because they're getting a lot of great publicity out of it  By not talking?  Leading up to the movie that's coming out, what, Friday? 
[02:45:00]  Mr. and Mrs. Smith  And the other point you brought up the other day  There's got to be some kind of divorce thing here  Yeah  They're still pending litigation  At this time  So he probably  All he can say  Yeah, he probably can't elaborate on their relationship  And how far into it they are  And when they started  And what they're doing  And what he's spending his money on  Things like that  I bet you if she was 300 pounds, though  And they asked him and he wasn't with her  He'd go, no, I'm not with her  Yeah  She's a friend  I admire her  That's not fucking  Stop with the bullshit  I admire her 
[02:45:30]  Do you really?  I admire her  I admire Brando  I want to fuck Angelina Jolie  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah, they're never honest with that  Can we please at one point talk about this?  Oh, of course  We can talk about that next  Please  That and the Bill O'Reilly cruise  We'll do a little cruise break next  Ooh, I can't wait  Alright  You guys know it?  That's what I'm doing  I'm taking a River Rose cruise  Alright, we'll get into that next  Oh  Why don't we play this 
[02:46:00]  What is it?  No  What is it, Opie?  I want to play this again  Go on a break  What is it?  It was very, very good  Came in overnight  And there's new listeners right now  Because they listen to the show  At different times  Harry T sent this in  It's great  Doesn't need a set up  Check it out  Look, he started to touch me  He started to grab me  I told him to stop  He didn't stop  I hit him back  And then he got really angry  He pushed me out of the car 
[02:46:30]  What do you want, fucko?  You want something?  Huh?  Huh?  What are you doing?  Oh, no  Fuck!  I broke my knee, man  Fuck!  I swear to my fucking mother  If you touch her again, you're dead  Hold my hand, man  I've got to squeeze something  Ah!  Fuck! 
[02:47:00]  Like sand through the hourglass  So is the ONA virus  Every rapper in the world  Wants a video game now  Is that the thing now  That they have to have?  They have to have their own video game  Like rappers are very competitive  We know this  They kill each other  They're so competitive  And, you know, it was  Sneakers  And then, you know  Clothing deals  Their rides  Whatever they're driving around in  And now they're very competitive 
[02:47:30]  About having video games  Well, the nice thing, you know  About video games  Is their egos can actually  You know, they're like  Give me some of that waifu  You know, maybe like  Flying through the air  With my kung fu skills  Oh, that's what they want to be like  Super heroes  Because they're always talking trash  About how hard they are  Yeah, man  I wants like wings and shit  That is really funny  I wants to get up on time  Be a working  Yeah, I want 
[02:48:00]  I want this to be like  Really whack  Like something  Completely unrealistic  Have me raising my kids  Yo, man  How about this  I get pulled over and shit  And I present  The proper paperwork  Shit  I don't back talk  To the cops  Or nothing  Oh, damn  I got an order of protection  I lost 20 points  Yeah, boy  Yo, one time in the video game  I want to refer to my baby's mother  As my fiance  Yeah, just completely unrealistic 
[02:48:30]  Then we go to do that mission  Where we shoot up Hot 97, man  Yo, how about this in this video game, man  Somebody does some shit in my community  And we actually take personal responsibility  How are you supposed to program that in?  That's too unrealistic  Just have me flying and shit  Obi and Anthony  The virus is spreading 
[02:49:00]  It's smoothie time.  Get me that kind of smoothie.  And get me a turkey on wheat with a little provolone and some deli mustard and Diet Coke. 
[02:49:30]  And get yourself a burger.  Jesus.  Get yourself a burger.  Look at this kid.  Yeah.  He weighs what?  How much do you weigh?  This is Travis, the go-getter.  I weigh about 125, 130.  Oh, my God.  That's how much Christian Bale weighed in The Machinist.  How tall are you?  5'7", 5'8".  Wow.  Yeah.  That's a healthy height-to-weight ratio if you live on Neptune.  Hey, listen, you got my order correctly? 
[02:50:00]  I want a little pretzels, too.  You want some?  Oh, nice pretzels?  A little bit of Diet Coke.  I want the same type of smoothie that fucking, well, you know what kind of lover he is, is getting.  And I want a turkey on rye with some fucking little bit of provolone and jelly mustard.  His body frame would be more so found on a planet with lighter gravity.  I know.  Probably like Mars or, yeah, not Neptune, which has a lot of gravity.  A very strong gravitational pull would be more a short, heavier life form would be found on Neptune. 
[02:50:30]  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Thank you, Anthony, for clearing that up.  And don't think as soon as I...  It made sense to me.  I was like, yeah.  As soon as I said it, I knew I went farther away than I should have.  I should have went closer to the sun.  But, you know, good thing that you and maybe one listener picked it up.  Right.  Hey, I pardon you.  All right.  That's the body.  I pardon you.  Dr. Steve sent me a package. 
[02:51:00]  Hey, what do you got?  I don't know, Anthony.  But it says Amazon.com on it.  It's an Amazon box.  Did he just send it, Matt?  Is he reusing Amazon boxes?  Yeah.  Dr. Steve probably ordered something from Amazon for himself.  A book on how to beat pedophile charges.  Dr. Steve is sending...  And he's an actual doctor.  He sent us an article.  He's a real doctor.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a cool guy.  But, you know, you keep his last name on the QT.  Of course.  Yeah, because he does send, like, things probably shouldn't be sending. 
[02:51:30]  Dude, this is my...  I have a connection to a doctor who's a really nice guy.  This is what he sends us.  Like a little Nexium, maybe some Prevacet, some antacids.  I don't do drugs.  I can't get prescribed.  I don't want fucking Vicodin.  I don't want any drugs.  Just a little Prevacet for the old acid indigestion.  I really am an old man.  But if you needed Vicodin, he'd probably be cool.  I don't know if he would do an illegal narcotic like that.  Yeah?  Yeah, I don't know.  He seems like he's pretty on the up and up.  Now, that's good.  For lack of another 1930s expression.  On the up and up. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, next time, could you seal this harder?  What is this?  Fucking Coke?  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Open the box, Jimmy.  I'm trying to.  Oh, wait.  Jesus.  Hold on.  Thanks, Hawk.  Fucking eight minutes later.  For a strong guy to kick sand in your face.  He can't get it.  His arms are shaking.  I know.  I'm like Mac the weakling.  By the way, someone...  Oh, NXIVM.  Oh, look.  He even put these little packages.  So the NXIVM...  There's a big box.  There's little balloons in there.  Little plastic balloons.  To keep the NXIVM from bouncing all over. 
[02:52:30]  How about next time?  More NXIVM?  That makes it tight.  Or a smaller box?  Why do you send a refrigerator box with two items plinking around it, you fucking lunatic?  There you go.  I was expecting a bigger bang.  Me too.  Okay.  Thank you, Steve.  I'm going to challenge your theory, Anthony.  Let's go to John in Virginia.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good.  It's not mine.  It's Jimmy's thing that he's challenging.  I was going to, but I didn't want to be...  What theory?  I'll kill everybody.  The further away from the sun you get, the more gravity on the planets. 
[02:53:00]  No, no, no, no.  That's not true.  No, I know.  I just meant I should have went to Venus or Mercury.  No, it's the size of the planet.  Like Jupiter, you'd weigh like 900 pounds if you were 200.  The mass of the planet, my friend.  The mass, not the size.  Not the distance to the sun.  But also the rotational spin, because Jupiter has a 10-hour day, so it rotates over almost  two and a half times per hour 24, which is why you're crushed.  10-hour day, yes.  10-hour day on Jupiter.  Spins in 10 hours.  The entire planet spins around one revolution in 10 hours. 
[02:53:30]  That's why it is such a crushing gravity.  It's the size of the planet versus the distance from the sun.  Say size of the planet again, and I'm going to throw hot coffee on you.  You're right about size of the planet, but it's also the rate at which it's spinning.  And you could take that to the bank.  I'm not sure about that.  Jupiter, 10-hour day.  Yeah, I understand.  But I think the gravity is the gravity, regardless of how fast the planet's spinning. 
[02:54:00]  I'm not sure if you're getting, you're talking like centrifugal force kind of pulling you  off the planet and gravity pulling you back, kind of canceling each other out.  Well, what else determines, like how much, like you weigh 200 pounds here, you weigh 900  pounds on Jupiter.  What else would determine that?  I mean, size of the planet.  Absolutely.  Mass of the planet is, the more mass you have, the more gravity you have.  Well, that's it.  But doesn't that, that also has to count in the speed?  Because mass going at like a slow speed is different than mass going at a fast speed.  I would think if you take a scale and you put it on something that's spinning. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  And then put a weight on it.  If you spin it faster, isn't the thing that you put on the scale going to want to fly off  more, thus making it lighter or seem lighter on the scale?  Maybe the way you're saying it, yeah.  But I know on Jupiter, you're a lot heavier and it's spinning a lot faster.  I think all those things come into play.  I just, I don't know enough about it.  I think spinning faster would make you lighter. 
[02:55:00]  Spinning faster would want to propel your mass off the planet's surface, which would  then take your weight off that scale.  The density and mass of the planet is then pulling you back, which is gravity, and that  is only the mass of the planet.  That has nothing to do with the spinning.  The spinning might make you lighter, and I'm not sure of this, I'm just speculating, that  it would try to throw you off the planet.  But then again, you'd have to be heavier to stay on it than if you're spinning faster. 
[02:55:30]  In order to prevent being thrown off, you'd have to be heavier.  Again, that's the mass.  The planet would have to be spinning like a whirling dervish to fling you off of it.  I'm not saying you'd actually fling off of the planet, but there would probably be some  kind of, you know, if the Earth stopped spinning, you know, we'd all croak.  But for that short time, would you weigh less or more?  I think you'd weigh more because you're canceling out the centrifugal force that would try to  throw you off the planet. 
[02:56:00]  No, wait, that doesn't make sense because then you'd weigh more on the North Pole than  you would on the equator.  And I don't think you do.  Yeah, okay, spinning does nothing.  Thank you, Jim.  I've just solved my own problem.  You'd weigh more on the North Pole because you have no centrifugal force on the North Pole.  When's lunch?  Because I want to go out back and smoke pot with my friends.  I'm trying to figure this out on the air.  I'm sorry I'm working through this.  I think it might be a combination because I know Jupiter spins extraordinarily.  The crushing gravity is from the speed of spinning and the mass.  I think it's a combination.  No, the gravity has nothing to do with the spinning. 
[02:56:30]  Sure it does.  Nothing.  The gravitational pull?  Nothing.  I think it has something to do with the spinning.  Absolutely not.  I am saying now nothing with the spinning.  I will research this.  That's what keeps us on the planet is the spinning.  No.  The spinning causes gravity.  Gravity.  No, it's the mass.  The planet's mass itself makes gravity.  But if the planet wasn't spinning, there'd be no gravity.  You'd be floating off it.  No.  No.  Just a big planet.  Wait.  You're agreeing?  Nathaniel is agreeing with me and Derek is agreeing with Jimmy. 
[02:57:00]  Because you know I'm right.  Spinning causes gravity.  No, it doesn't.  Sure it does.  Mass causes gravity.  But mass has to turn.  Say you just take a big planet and you put it in space with no movement.  Everything is going to float off it.  I think that's why you would probably float off the moon.  Because I don't know if it spins or not.  It does spin.  Maybe it doesn't spin fast enough to keep you.  It spins at the exact same time.  Maybe it doesn't spin fast enough to keep you.  Or maybe it's the lack of atmosphere.  There is gravity on.  But just not enough.  Here's a planet that doesn't spin. 
[02:57:30]  Mars does not spin.  Okay.  And Mars has gravity.  Because it has mass.  It has less mass.  So you don't have as much.  You don't weigh as much on Mars as you would on Earth.  But it doesn't spin.  Then there's got to be some other factor that comes into play as well.  But I know spinning has something to do with gravity.  No.  Sorry.  Or rotation.  I am not agreeing with you, Jimmy.  I know.  But somebody will call it.  Who knows?  I think it's a combination.  The spinning, the only thing I can think of is the spinning probably stabilizes the central 
[02:58:00]  mass, especially on Earth, which is just molten.  It stabilizes it where it would stabilize the gravity, but doesn't make the gravity.  Yes?  I've just been waiting here.  It's quite simple.  Okay.  When a mass is present in the above space, the highlighted part, Opie.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Shut up.  The highlighted line.  No.  Opie, look at me when you're saying this.  I want to feel connected.  Eye-to-eye contact, man.  Explain to me.  Don't look often.  I want to be explained to you.  Guys, it's quite simple.  When a mass is present in the above space-time, it distorts it so that, whilst it remains 
[02:58:30]  true that traveling through space causes you to travel through time.  What?  Whilst.  Time.  Whilst.  Whilst.  Travel through time.  Traveling through time now causes you to move, or you might want to say accelerate,  Anthony, through space.  In other words, just by existing, you are compelled to move through space.  This, my friends, is gravity.  That makes no sense whatsoever. 
[02:59:00]  Of course it doesn't.  It's apples and oranges.  It's space-time.  It's planets.  It's planets and moons.  Let's keep it in the right areas.  I say gravity is based sheerly on the mass of a planet.  Combined with the spinning, with the rotation.  And nothing to do with spinning.  What do you think keeps all of our planets rotating around the sun?  The fact the sun spins is what keeps us all.  It is the gravity of the huge mass of the sun.  The sun is huge. 
[02:59:30]  The mass of the sun is huge.  Its gravity is huge.  It has sucked up the planets and then has them rotating around it because of its gravitational  field.  And the spin.  It has to rotate.  It has nothing to do with its spin.  I could understand the spin stabilizing a mass, keeping it in one spot, stabilizing the  rotation around the sun.  Everything spinning, stabilized, just like a bullet rotating out of the barrel of a gun  keeps it straight.  That would keep it stabilized. 
[03:00:00]  But it has nothing to do with gravity.  If there's a mass large enough, whether it's spinning, moving, or standing still, if it's  mass, it will have gravity.  How does mass have gravity, though?  How does it happen?  That's just something that is.  It's a law of life and law of nature as we know it.  If something has mass, it has gravity.  Just something big draws something smaller to it.  Something, yes, something with mass will have gravity.  It will have an attraction.  I wish someone out there knows the answer.  Anthony?  Just call him a fuckface. 
[03:00:30]  Just get it over with.  No.  Fuckface.  Because I think that's a sociopathic argument to say that mass is just mass.  Mass makes gravity.  Spinning is stabilizing.  No, no spinning.  Jimmy, there isn't spinning.  Go to your outfield and spin.  And have your coach call you a ballerina.  I just did the, Jimmy, what are you, a physicist?  We'd get the answer.  Jimmy starts spinning.  All his playmates go flying towards him because he's all of a sudden got gravity.  No.  That would be Bob Kelly in the outfield because he's got mass. 
[03:01:00]  We would have got the answer to this, but Carl Sagan's been outside the studio for three  hours waiting to come in here.  Why do you make him wait?  If we didn't make him wait, we would have got the answer to this hours ago.  I will do the research.  Can someone call?  Do we have...  All right, we got a few calls.  Let's go to Eric.  I see we have a few calls.  Let's say hi to Eric.  Go ahead, Eric.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I can settle this real quick.  Jupiter and Neptune are both out of planets, so they actually don't have an actual surface. 
[03:01:30]  They're both gaseous planets, so you can't even stand on either one of those planets.  But if you want to stand on one of the Jupiter moons, there's one that's actually larger  than Earth.  That would have more gravity.  So Anthony is right.  The larger the planet is based on the mass, that gives it a more gravitational pull.  It has nothing to do with the spin.  But you're saying that spinning has nothing to do with the creation of gravity?  No, that's more of a...  What is it?  Like almost like a centrifuge.  It just keeps everything together.  But the mass, the size of it is what keeps everything, so you get more gravity based 
[03:02:00]  on the mass of it, not really the spin.  I don't say that the size doesn't go into the amount of gravity, but I'm saying that  I think that rotating has something to do with the creation of gravity or the distance  of gravity.  I would say it has nothing to do with it.  And Eric, what is your background that you know this?  I actually just took my astronomy final about half an hour ago.  For college?  Astronomy final.  Yeah, at Kingsborough in Brooklyn.  There you go.  We have an expert, Anthony.  High quality college education there.  All right, let's go to Matt on Long Island. 
[03:02:30]  Matt, go ahead.  Yeah, when they said...  Up and everything.  What?  Matt.  It creates...  So they feel more like they're on Earth.  Really?  You're...  Wait, what?  Go ahead, Matt.  Try again.  I think I actually know what he's saying.  They have to spin.  In certain space station prototypes and stuff, they have a space station that spins.  And the spinning space station makes artificial gravity.  But what that's using is centrifugal force. 
[03:03:00]  What they would do is build the floor where you'd see the walls of the ship, of the station.  So when you spin it at a certain speed, you'll actually fly against it like a carnival ride.  That carnival ride where you would stick to the wall.  But instead of laying on the wall, you're actually walking on it.  And that's how you make it.  Like Moonraker.  Let me...  The movie Moonraker.  If you remember...  Or 2001 A Space Odyssey is another one.  They show the space station.  And in that case, spinning makes gravity, but it's a whole different concept. 
[03:03:30]  Right.  You're saying it's centrifugal force, not actually...  It's a simulation of gravity, but not real gravity.  Yeah, but not real gravity.  Maybe you are right, but I don't think you are.  I still think that spinning has something to do with gravity.  Why is Steven here?  Oh, Steve?  Steve's mass is actually making gravity.  Exactly.  He's such a huge bear.  What are you talking about?  Exactly.  That's exactly the point I was going to make.  Glide towards him.  If mass strictly...  If mass...  Did you determine...  Oh, no, you didn't.  If mass determines gravity and solely mass, how come larger people don't walk around with  smaller people stuck to them? 
[03:04:00]  All right.  Good point, Hack.  I really...  That wasn't even a joke.  That was...  Yes, it was.  It was an attempt at a joke.  You're right.  An attempt.  It wasn't a joke, though.  That you're correct on.  I was very serious.  Because something...  In order to have gravity needs huge amounts of mass.  You need huge mass.  Ramon, bring me Stephen Hawking.  Gravity is based solely on mass.  Uh-huh.  A lot of people are saying that.  Let's go to Vinny and... 
[03:04:30]  Yes, Vinny.  All right, Vinny.  Hey, L.P., Anthony, Daddy.  All right.  Daddy.  All right, thank you, Daddy.  Jesus.  Hey, one thing you guys are forgetting is if you take a planet twice the size of the Earth  and you spin it three times as fast, is Anthony's periwinkle shirt still gay?  Let me calculate.  I'm punching those figures in now as we speak.  And yes, it's coming up full fag.  Well, that's got a gravitational theory, too.  It's like the more periwinkle your shirt is, the more likely your mouth is to be drawn 
[03:05:00]  to a cock.  And we let that drop today.  Wait, did anybody...  Now, is anybody saying I'm right at all?  I don't think so.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  If everybody said I'm wrong, then I'm wrong.  Jason is saying equally important, which I think he's trying to say that it's both spinning  and mass, but I don't buy that.  I don't think it's...  I don't know what the ratio of importance is.  I just think that it certainly has something to do with rotation.  I'm not saying... 
[03:05:30]  Maybe centrifugal force is a part of gravity.  But centrifugal force would only make you lighter.  With that theory that the spinning has something to do with gravity, spinning on the outside  of the planet, say you're standing on the equator, the Earth is spinning, wouldn't it then tend  to throw you off the planet, which would make you lighter, which is against gravity?  That's the opposite of gravity.  I don't know in a space situation where it's a vacuum.  I don't know.  I'm talking on Earth.  I'm talking here on Earth.  You're on the equator.  There it's spinning as opposed to being on the North Pole, which is you would get no 
[03:06:00]  centrifugal force because you're, you know, the North Pole is the pivot point.  Right.  So you're standing there on the North Pole.  With your theory, you would weigh more on the North Pole than you would on the equator.  Or actually, you would say you would weigh more on the equator because you're saying the  spinning makes gravity.  I'm saying it's a part of gravity.  And plus, even if you're not in that right location, I think the whole planet has the  amount of, the same amount of gravity.  Yeah, that's just it.  It does, regardless of the spin. 
[03:06:30]  You're getting a full spin on the equator.  You're getting the full, like, centrifugal force spin standing on the equator.  You're getting none of it on the North Pole, yet you weigh exactly the same standing on  the equator or the North Pole.  I still think, I mean, I can't argue that point because you sound like you're right.  Because I sound like I'm right.  It does sound right.  Anthony, Isaac Newton was the first scientist to define gravity mathematically when he formulated  his law of universal gravitation.  Right.  Okay.  The law of gravitation says that gravity is strong as between two very massive objects 
[03:07:00]  and gets much weaker as these objects get further apart.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mass.  But it has something to do with the distance, the relationship, how far away you are from  them.  He doesn't say...  Well, yeah.  The gravity gets less the further away you get.  That's why, you know, when spaceships leave the Earth's orbit, the further away they get...  But what causes the gravity?  Mass.  But he didn't say that Isaac Newton is not saying that's what causes gravity.  No, he's not saying what causes it. 
[03:07:30]  He's not saying what causes gravity.  What makes gravity is the mass.  It's mass.  Or the importance of a situation.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's the gravity of this situation?  Back in high school from those, you know, the films that they made to watch in physics  class, when you see the solar system start to come together, and everything's always  spinning.  So, like, the spinning kind of helps to bring all that mass together, which is what makes  the gravity, you know?  Like, it's not...  Either the spinning helps to bring all those atoms and everything together over millions 
[03:08:00]  of years to make those massive planets and suns and all that stuff.  The spinning is a part of the planets and the way they move and react to each other's  gravity, but it doesn't make the gravity.  No.  The rotation, the speed, everything is how it all wraps up and affects each other's gravity.  Every planet in the solar system affects the other one based on its gravity, its rotation, 
[03:08:30]  the sun, but it doesn't cause the gravity.  Right.  The gravity is caused by the mass.  The rotation helps to make the orbits, you know, because, like, you have the sun sitting  when gravity affects the fabric of space-time, and the sun is sitting in the center of it,  and all the planets are around it in the big bowl.  You've got to watch Brian Greene on nobody's really good.  The big bowl, and then it spins around it.  The spinning of the planets is what, you know, makes the revolutions possible.  Yeah, because if you just have an object, a giant object... 
[03:09:00]  Well, that would have a lot of gravity.  A giant object makes gravity, period.  So things are going to be drawn to it.  A magnetic force is what keeps us from getting sucked into the center of the Earth.  Shut up.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  It doesn't make sense just to have a large object is going to have gravity.  I know it doesn't make sense, but it's true.  It makes no sense whatsoever that just because something's large gives it this magnetic pull.  But that's just the way it is.  That's so, so sympathetic.  I don't even know if I know how to respond to that.  If you take a copper and wrap it up and spin it around magnets, it makes electricity. 
[03:09:30]  They don't even know why.  They're not even really sure why a generator works.  But it just happens that's what makes it work.  There's no explaining it.  It's just like mass.  For some reason, when something's giant, things get pulled towards it, as opposed to in a singles bar where it's exactly the opposite.  The bigger it is, the more you shun it.  That would be a while.  Sometimes when I'm looking at paperclips or things, they're all attached to the front of Ben's pants. 
[03:10:00]  Maybe I'm wrong.  Can we look up the definition of gravity?  Yeah.  Why haven't we just gotten that?  You guys...  I'll work on that tonight.  I'll put together a whole report.  I didn't realize that this started because you wanted smoothies, right?  Wow.  Really?  Smoothies.  How did the smoothie turn into that argument?  I don't know, because then Travis was thin, looking...  Oh, right, because Travis is thin, looking like he grew up on Neptune. 
[03:10:30]  That's why you always got to bear with us on this program.  You never know what's going to happen.  You never know what turn we're going to take.  People are sending me links to all kinds of definitions on this, and every link I've checked doesn't work.  You're just wonderfully retarded people.  How about this?  You go to dictionary.com and look up gravity and just see what it says.  Yeah.  Let's go to Dave in Florida.  Dave?  Yeah.  To shoot down Jim's theory, if the rotation...  The space shuttle's in orbit, yet they have no gravity. 
[03:11:00]  What?  The space shuttle.  It's going as fast as the Earth spins around, yet there's no gravity on the space shuttle when it's in outer space.  Well, isn't that an atmosphere thing, too?  Because once you leave the Earth's atmosphere, oh, that's the gravitational pull you're leaving.  Oh, the atmosphere.  That's correct.  Jimmy, the atmosphere has nothing to do with gravity, either.  No, no, no, no, no.  But what I'm saying is, like, once you leave the atmosphere, that's how far the Earth's gravitational pull seems to go.  Oh, no, it goes far.  No, it goes really far.  It goes to, you know...  But isn't the challenge...  Wait, isn't the space shuttle being held to the Earth in that rotation by the Earth's gravity? 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Well, it has a lot to do with escape velocity, too.  Oh, escape velocity.  Yeah, I know.  I was going to say that yesterday.  Yeah.  25,000 miles per hour, by the way.  That didn't shoot my, what, the Earth?  No, escape velocity.  Escape velocity.  You plan on going to the moon.  So, if you throw a baseball that fast, it'll never come, hit the ground?  It'll leave Earth's orbit.  It'll probably be eaten up by the atmosphere.  Guys, can we go back to talking about tits? 
[03:12:00]  Sure.  I want a clear-cut definition of gravity.  Tits and their reaction to gravity.  Gravity is the enemy of the tit, Opie.  You've noticed.  Gravity and time, really the enemy of the tit.  And I don't think we'll get any argument from that.  Uh, no.  Well, how about a definition?  Oh, we got it?  Or, Opie, can you just think of one?  Please, give him the mic.  I've just been waiting for you guys to ask me.  Oh, finally.  Oh, my God.  When it comes to physics, Anthony, the natural force of attraction exerted by a celestial body 
[03:12:30]  such as Earth upon objects at or near its surface, tending to draw them toward the center of the body.  It does say nothing about spin.  Gravity, mass, man.  All right.  Oh, I know I'm right.  Yeah, I think you are.  Should we take a break?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Should we take a break?  No.  Well, the force of attraction between all masses in the universe. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, I guess.  All masses, regardless of them spinning or not.  Well, that's kind of like what I was saying.  Because I did acknowledge that.  Jimmy, you're never too old to learn something new.  You know, it's like.  Don't take this as something bad.  This is a good thing.  You're learning.  Not a good thing.  You're learning.  What I'm learning is I kind of, like, should have shut my face immediately and played it  like, well, I'm not too sure.  But instead I took the argument.  God damn it.  If it wasn't for spin, we'd all be floating.  Spinning sucks my dick and it wrecks everything. 
[03:13:30]  Should we talk about the cruise now or what?  Oh, I can't wait.  Here we go.  That's what I need.  To take off the sting of my stunning defeat, I need to go for a ride on the River Rose.  The River Rose.  That's where you do some spinning, but it's with a mule between your ass cheeks.  I mean, what the hell is the River Rose?  I don't know.  Ben, what does Ben?  This is one of our buddy's boats.  Now, I went out on this boat for Fourth of July.  You've been on the River Rose?  You've been on the River Rose? 
[03:14:00]  Oh.  They have specialty cruises that I have no clue what they are.  And he hadn't started doing this yet.  Did you go on the Periwinkle cruise?  No, I wasn't on the Periwinkle cruise.  I went on the Fourth of July, about four years ago, I guess.  And we went up the East River, right by the United Nations, right where the fireworks are set off.  And it was really great.  Did some drinking on there, watching the fireworks.  It was a really good time.  We should get a booze cruise together for this show.  Yeah. 
[03:14:30]  Thinking about the Bill O'Reilly disaster.  How about the cruise right here?  The River Rose?  The one they're talking about.  They have to change it to the River Tulip Sunny Oregon.  Well, apparently, you know, one Fourth of July cruise a year isn't enough to keep the boat going.  So, he's opened up the boat to various specialty cruises.  And I guess one that he's advertising is...  The River Rose is available for alternative lifestyle weddings, engagements, birthdays, or any occasion.  Any occasion. 
[03:15:00]  Basically, no matter where you stick your dick, you can do it on this boat.  Midnight cruises, sunset cruises, Sunday tea dances.  Oh.  Sunday tea dances.  No, no, and it's spelled T-E-A, but I think it's supposed to be just the letter T.  T.  But he does those dances.  We're leaving quickly.  Leaving quickly.  Tea dances.  The Gay Pride Weekend Sunset Cruise.  Basically, you know, you can watch the sun go down. 
[03:15:30]  I'll go to the rim.  Sunset.  Hey, set your sun on this car.  Well, that's right.  And then he can set his eyes on his friends' families who appear normal.  While yours doesn't.  How come there's a mom and dad in that home, and I just have two fellas with breath robes who cough a lot?  Breath robes.  He was so excited about his joke.  I know.  That's right.  It was a Japanese fag.  That was more just excitement coming out.  He knew he had a good one. 
[03:16:00]  Breath robes.  Oh, my breath roll.  Breath roll.  Yeah.  Me cough.  Day Pride Weekend Sunset Cruise.  Friday, June 24th.  Boarding at 6.45 p.m.  Returns at 11 o'clock p.m.  And God knows what's going to happen during that cruise.  That's right.  It's going to be sassy.  Going to have to squeegee the deck off when he gets back.  Cruise the sky.  Oh, this is around here.  I thought this was in Florida.  Cruise the skyline of Manhattan's Statue of Liberty.  That's right.  Just see a...  Which is actually a tranny, the Statue of Liberty. 
[03:16:30]  Hi, Daddy.  Hi, Big Dick Daddy.  Wave a big thing in the air.  Aboard the River Road.  Sailing from the World's Fair Marina in Queens.  There's free parking there.  Our Sunset Cruise features guest DJs to the sounds of 70s, 80s, 90s disco classics.  House music, salsa merengue, cash bar with bar, special beer, wine, mixed drinks.  Ron B. as Tina Turner.  Oh, no. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, man.  That's right.  What a shot.  Female impersonator.  We'll host a show featuring Miss Mess performing a salute to disco.  Be sure to get your tics early in the free exclamation point.  Of course.  Which means they're going fast.  $35.  Tics venereal disease in the Navy.  Drop down to your knees.  Yeah.  $35 in advance on our site. 
[03:17:30]  Put your dick in another man.  Stick it in his can.  In the Navy.  In the Navy.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's a ball bag on ass feet.  And my ass is black and blue.  They want you.  I'll suck off a Puerto Rican or Jew.  All right.  So, I'll be sure to hop on the hip cruise. 
[03:18:00]  $35 in advance or $40 at Dockside.  Oh, Dockside.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I heard that wrong.  I love the website.  www.divasdamesanddykes.com.  You know what you're getting when you go there.  Divasdamesanddykes.com.  Yes.  Woo!  In the Navy.  Catch the HIV. 
[03:18:30]  Yes.  So, he's doing gay cruises, obviously.  Yes.  Our friend, who ironically has a gay porno mustache, will be fine.  Yes, he does.  Believe me, they're going to say, everyone that gets on the boat with Billy is going,  didn't I see you in 1978 in a film?  I'm going, ah, no, you're going to be there.  Somebody else.  I just can't picture him on this cruise.  I neither can see him.  Does he go or does he just send the boat out by itself and leave it to his own devices? 
[03:19:00]  I bet he goes.  He probably ties his shirt and a little fucking bow in the front and wears Speedos and a pair  of sneakers with no socks.  Oh, he's a queen.  All right.  Divasdamesanddykes.com.  Or you can email divasdamesdykes at AOL.com.  And it's June 20.  That sounds wonderful.  Fourth of Friday night.  And it should be a nice cruise.  I've actually cruised around in the boats, not this particular one.  No?  But, yeah, it's actually cool.  You went on a gay cruise? 
[03:19:30]  I certainly didn't.  Oh, okay.  It was the comedy solo cruise.  We should get a booze cruise together, though.  Squeegee the deck.  It looks like a bunch of white jellyfish behind the boat.  Chasing it.  Hey, somebody spilled silicone implants all over the place.  No, no, no.  Hey, everyone wants to talk about gravity.  We're done with the gravity thing.  And, by the way, you don't have to squeegee the deck.  Just ask the guests to lick the floor before they get off the boat.  Let's go to – all right.  We'll take one more because it's always fun to take a call from Alabama. 
[03:20:00]  All right, Alabama.  Les, what's up?  Yeah.  You know, answer to your rotation gravity deal?  Yeah, deal.  It's the core that causes the gravity.  The rotation of the core is what causes the gravity.  The rotation of the core of the sun is what causes gravity to the sun.  The core of the earth spins rotation, and it causes gravity in the earth.  So the mass of the core is what causes the gravity.  Where did you hear this, sir? 
[03:20:30]  I watch National Indographic, and I watch them nature shows.  I love this guy.  Yeah, I hear you.  So you're saying that while it is a mass that has gravity, now he's listening to himself.  So he's saying that the core of the mass is what causes the gravity in the mass.  My beloved core!  It's what causes the gravitational pull.  So Anthony's right when he says that the mass has it, but you're saying it's the rotation of the core. 
[03:21:00]  It's the rotation of the mass in the core.  That causes the mass to have it.  I will not buy this man's explanation, because there are massive bodies in space that have gravity and no core whatsoever.  What about giant meteors in the meteor belt that are just hunks of iron, and they have gravity?  In the meteor belt, they're held there by the...  I'm not talking about what they're held there by, but they themselves, if they're big enough and have enough mass, they have gravity spinning. 
[03:21:30]  But they have a core.  They have a core.  No, they don't.  They're just huge chunks of iron.  But then again, wait a minute.  The Earth has an independent core that's rotating.  Have you ever watched The Journey to the Center of the Earth?  He's getting his info from Journey to the Center of the Earth.  The only thing I will say, though, is when you look at something like a neutron star, John, I don't know.  The Journey to the Center of the Earth, when they dropped all them bombs,  just to restart the core of the Earth?  Right.  Okay.  When they restarted the core of the Earth, remember at the beginning of the movie, 
[03:22:00]  they had all kinds of bad storms, and they had the problem with the gravitational pull.  When they restarted the core of the Earth...  Then there's a giant lizard.  There's a giant lizard there?  No, no, no, no.  I'm talking about the newest version.  What about...  When they used that...  What about when they shot that spaceship into the person's body?  When they made it real teeny tiny, and they had to go through his heart, 
[03:22:30]  and then the blood cells was trying to eat them like they were so much vittles?  Well, it is the core...  It is the rotation of the core that causes the gravity.  All right.  Thank you, Les.  Thank you.  My only thing is...  Physics with Larry the Cable Guy.  One of the things I have...  Now, this might be a mass thing, but when a star collapses on itself and becomes a black hole,  what sucks things into it is the intense gravity, and that is...  I know there's a tremendous spin there, which brings things in.  That's why I'm thinking... 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, but it's just the mass.  But is there anything else?  It's the mass in such a small area.  If you take the mass of a huge sun and squeeze it down to the size of a softball,  the gravity coming off of that softball is going to be as much as the gravity was off of the huge sun.  But in the size of a softball, it's going to suck everything in like a drain.  I still think that the rotation...  You love the rotation, don't you?  I just...  I don't know why I'm stuck on that.  I've read a lot about it.  I've listened to a lot of the Strami show.  I don't know why I'm thinking it goes into it. 
[03:23:30]  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  I'm scared.  You're scared?  Where's my smoothie?  Yeah, this old...  Travis!  It's a stupid smoothie.  Order.  Who's outside?  Bedelia!  Where's my cake, you bitch?  Bedelia!  Dan, he's laughing.  Creepshow.  Great movie.  Did you know...  I bought a gerbil at the petting zoo.  If Richard Gere can do it, I can too.  I get undressed, I start to lube. 
[03:24:00]  I stick the gerbil in the end of the tube.  Wondering just how he'll feel.  Will he like it better than his little wheel?  Careful now, he's right beside me.  One more inch and he's inside me.  Go, gerbil, go.  Burrow harder, burrow deeper. 
[03:24:30]  Be my little chimney sweeper.  One thing I forgot about.  How am I supposed to get you out?  So now my gerbil's on easy street.  It's warm and cozy and there's plenty to eat. 
[03:25:00]  The situation is beyond my control.  Gotta find a way to get him out of his hole.  I try crowbars, I try wires.  I almost hurt him with a pair of pliers.  I try cheese, but he's not biting.  I wish this wasn't so exciting.  Go, gerbil, go. 
[03:25:30]  Jesus, I am such a sucker.  Please get out, you furry.  I think I am getting ill.  Suddenly, he's very, very still.  Now it's too late, my gerbil died. 
[03:26:00]  I guess I have committed gerbicide.  Here's some advice.  It's very clear cut.  If you love your gerbil,  don't stick him up your butt.  Don't stick him up your butt.  Little fairy gerbil in your booty hole.  All right.  Wow.  The gerbil song.  All right.  Thank you. 
[03:26:30]  Weedy, look.  I feel the ball.  You've got to respect that.  Disgusting.  Oh, God.  These two are still at it.  Now it has something to do with atoms, Anthony?  What do you think? 
[03:27:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Gravity.  Each particle of matter attracts every other particle.  That's what happens.  You get atoms are naturally attracted to others.  So if you put enough of them in one place,  in one object,  they are going to want to pull other atoms toward them.  Atoms attracted to atoms.  That sounds like Billy's boat cruise.  All right, God.  All right.  Can we move on?  I was incorrect. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, bananary.  I was...  I was...  Remember when the Fonz couldn't say wrong?  Couldn't say it was wrong.  What a great episode.  How many of these NXIVMs are you supposed to take and how often?  A whole bottle every hour.  Sounds good.  I got a great amount of respect for him.  He was great in his time.  But I think this is our time now.  You're going to get Kevin killed. 
[03:28:00]  You better stop.  Yeah, this is Tyson, uh...  Saturday.  Tyson fight.  Yeah, and they're just saying he's just a mellow dude now.  But basically, I guess this was, uh...  Fighting a big Irish guy.  Yeah, Kevin McBride.  And this is his advisor, I guess.  Basically saying that, uh...  You know, it's their time.  By their, he means whitey?  Yeah.  Is that what he means?  It's time for another white fighter to do well?  Yeah.  Who was the last one?  Uh...  Gentleman Jim Corbett. 
[03:28:30]  I have no idea.  Jerry.  He's going back to the 1800s.  Maybe Jerry Cooney.  Jerry Cooney.  Laurie.  Isn't that funny?  He's a white guy.  Had that name.  I got a great amount of respect for him.  He was great in his time.  But I think this is our time now.  You're going to get Kevin killed.  You better stop.  Get Kevin killed.  Get him killed.  You better stop.  Just go sit down.  Just go sit down. 
[03:29:00]  Say have a good fight.  Listen.  I've been working with Kevin for two and a half years.  I've never seen him prepare himself like he has.  I'm going to get him like a fish.  Sit down.  Sit down.  I'm going to get him like a fish.  And you know Kevin's probably going,  Ixnay on the speech egg.  Yeah.  Shut the...  Ixnay on the speech egg.  Shut up.  Yeah.  That face you're making on. 
[03:29:30]  Shut up.  Setting.  Ixnay on the speech egg.  Oh, God.  What?  I'm saying what?  Ixnay on the speech egg.  Ixnay on the speech egg.  Ooyay, aryay, ising, pay, offyay, ee they igor nay.  I understood only one word of that.  Oh.  Anthony, it's Gamefly.com.  I was just reading the paper today.  No, was it the...  I was trying to remember what magazine it was.  Damn it.  Was it in the paper today? 
[03:30:00]  Talking about another Tomb Raider coming out.  Oh, yeah?  I heard they tamed down her boobs in it.  Her hotness?  Yeah, they made her boobs smaller in it because they didn't want it to be sexist.  And they want girls to be able to play it and not feel intimidated by Lara Croft's big boobies.  I was a big fan of the Tomb Raider series for a while there.  And then it got to be the same old thing.  And then I heard they were changing the, what do they call it, like the engine?  Yeah, they had to update it.  It was ridiculous. 
[03:30:30]  It was very old.  I guess the new one is there's a buzz on the new Tomb Raider game with Lara Croft.  And you know what?  I'm going to be honest, Anthony.  That's going to be one of the games I'm going to try out and not buy.  You're going to try it?  Yeah, I'm going to do the whole GameFly.com and try out the new Lara Croft game.  It's easy, Opie.  And you could actually pick another game you want to check out.  You have two games out at a time at GameFly.  You keep them as long as you want with none of those late fees.  And if you decide now you like the game, you just click keep it in your game queue.  And you'll get the mint condition box and manual delivered to you, all at a great member discount. 
[03:31:00]  How about that?  Only costs $21.95 a month.  You can start with a free two-week trial.  No commitments.  Cancel any time you want.  Start playing all the latest releases, all those games you wanted to play at GameFly.com.  Over 2,500 titles to choose from.

That's how easy it is.  All the games you want.  Go to GameFly.com slash XM. 
[03:31:30]  That's GameFly.com.  I'm so engrossed right now in stupid Star Wars Galaxies.  I bought the upgrade, and now last night I started my Jedi quest.  I'm questing to be a Jedi.  So that should be done in four months.  Really?  It takes that long?  It takes four months.  Something like that.  It's ridiculous.  They put you on a schedule of these phases that you have to do certain things in certain phases.  And the phases are on like four-week intervals that you've got to do these things in. 
[03:32:00]  And there's five of them.  It just takes forever.  Frigging game.  It's like a job.  I thought I was spending too much time playing Hot Shots 4.  Oh, no.  I'm a month into the game.  No, you've got to get into the real crack.  Massive online.  Massive multiplayer.  I'm still smoking the video pot.  That's what you're doing?  Yeah.  Game pot?  Game pot, I should say.  Little taste?  Video game pot.  I went from video game booze, you know, a couple arcade games of Pac-Man, things like 
[03:32:30]  that, back when I was a kid.  Then I went to the pot, where I picked up an Atari and used to play some of those games  on the home Atari.  That's where the addiction started.  Started there.  Little video game pot.  But once your PC became available, I was right on the heroin.  Just mainlining into my retina.  Just every game I could get my hands on.  Someone wants to know if you ever got your wizard robe. 
[03:33:00]  Yes, I did.  I did.  EverQuest 2.  I was questing for my wizard robe.  That wasn't that hard, though.  When you get the robe, can you make it into any colors you like?  Some of them you can.  Can you make it into a periwinkle robe?  No, I think there was periwinkle in it.  To tell you the truth.  With a whole cut in the back at ash level?  I think there was periwinkle in it.  But you don't want to change the color because you want to go around and let people know that  that's the robe that you quested for and actually achieved.  Then people go, ooh.  There was a case I just read the other day in China where a man just was convicted and 
[03:33:30]  given a life sentence for murdering a friend of his because the friend had gone on to his  online game, some big online game in China that's the same as EverQuest, and found out  that his friend, who he had lent his account to for a little while, sold for real money  one of the online weapons that the guy had collected.  This sword that he apparently had been questing for for months and months, and his friend  sold it for actual money, and his buddy went over his house, they got into an argument, 
[03:34:00]  and he killed him with a real sword.  Took a real sword and killed him.  What was the game where you hit your opponent and an expression comes over its face?  Yeah, fantasy game.  I wanted to see what it looked like when someone happy or perplexed.  So, you know, people take these things very seriously.  So when you quest for a robe or an armor item and you actually get it, you wear it proudly  and people look at it and go, wow, he actually worked for that. 
[03:34:30]  All right, let's go to Corey.  Hey, Corey, what's up?  What's up, guys?  What's up, Pat?  I'm eating.  Hello?  And I have some really bad news for you, bro.  Yeah.  It takes a hell of a long time for four months to get Jedi.  I think that's the minimum you can do it in is four months.  Minimum, if you play like 24 hours a day.  The deal is that you unlock the four branches.  Yeah.  But in order to actually progress up the branches, you have to earn XP.  And the XP is a ridiculously inflated level for Jedi.  What you do is you cash in your regular XP and it converts to like a six-to-one scale, 
[03:35:00]  a three-to-one scale.  So for every six points of XP, you get one for Jedi.  It's one-to-one for a bounty hunter combat XP.  I wouldn't know that because I'm not a bounty hunter.  I would, asshole.  Ha-ha.  Hang up on Corey.  I just beat him.  I'm a bounty hunter.  I'm such a faggot.  Let's go to JR.  Hey, guys.  Hey, JR.  Love the show.  Been listening to you guys for three months.  Just wanted to thank you for keeping some of us fat people thin.  With your laughs, getting a six-pack for a while. 
[03:35:30]  Ah, there you go.  Spread the virus for us.  Tell your friends.  Spread the virus, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  There you go.  JR.  Tell them how you know.  What is this?  AJ in Connecticut.  AJ.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  And I want to know if you've ever bought any online gaming currency with real money.  I've earned everything I play for online, my friend.  Wait, what?  What?  No, have you really?  Hold on.  What's that about, Ant?  People have sold things that they've earned online on eBay for huge amounts of money. 
[03:36:00]  But how do you make that transaction?  You go to various websites or you go to eBay.  eBay has really kind of put a stop to it because Sony, who puts the games out, is really getting pissed off.  But you go there, it says what server it's on, and you find the server that you're on.  You pay the guy the money.  He finds you online and gives you the Rolls-Royce that you ordered. 
[03:36:30]  Wait a minute.  So now you've got this newbie that knows nothing how to play with this uber character that's like, this is really going on?  Oh, yeah.  So, dude, thousands of dollars people have paid.  All right, so let's say you're an expert at one of these games and you've got all these weapons that take, what, months to get?  Years sometimes.  Or full characters.  They've leveled people up to, like, level 70.  All right, so you're playing this game and you know what you're doing and you level everything up and you get $1,000 for a dark Jedi Knight on the Gorath server with over 10 million credits. 
[03:37:00]  All right.  That's dollars.  What do you do with that?  So wait, you play and now you go on there and you kick everyone's ass.  You're the big guy on campus.  Now your status is way up.  Hold on, I want to follow this with Anthony.  So now you make the deal in the real world on eBay, what have you.  And then you decide, all right, we're going to meet in this virtual world at the...  So you meet me at the starport.  At the starport.  There you go.  So there the character comes walking up to you and then you hand over what you had.  Yeah, then you make a trade there and hand over the goods. 
[03:37:30]  That's messed up.  Yeah.  People are buying self-esteem.  Wow, that guy is badass.  Come on, look.  He's got the double-edged lightsaber, double-bladed lightsaber, Dark Jedi.  $500 for that character?  Sold.  So you've never done this?  No, I've never bought.  Once in EverQuest, someone gave me a jaundice bone bracer, which I was able to cast a pretty  good spell.  I got that for free.  That is really interesting.  But I never bought anything. 
[03:38:00]  They should monitor this and anybody who would pay for one of these characters should be summarily  executed because you have nothing to contribute to society.  Granted, I'd pay for feces.  I know there's something inconsistent there.  You know what it is?  If you could pay some money and then be the baddest-ass motherfucker in this group of people  you're playing with, why wouldn't you do that if you're a nerdy guy with some money?  Because it's fun to earn.  It's a game.  I know.  Well, some people find it fun to earn.  Other people who have maybe been spit on their whole life and beat up in school now can be a  dark Jedi with a double-bladed lightsaber is kicking ass all over the game. 
[03:38:30]  That's who he wants to be.  I'd like to buy that character.  I don't condone it, by the way.  And then kill it immediately.  Delete.  That's right.  $1,000.  Buy.  Level 70.  Eat my ass.  Game Boy City.  This topic comes up a lot about people living their lives in the virtual world instead of  in the real world.  And I see nothing wrong with it.  Some people's lives suck. 
[03:39:00]  Why not dive in here first?  If you're getting satisfaction out of it, why go outside and play?  You can socialize.  You can get into battles.  You can team up with people.  Live your life online.  What is that item?  You're bidding on two Jedi characters and their weapons.  Ooh, look at the lightsaber and everything.  How much are they, Hawk?  This one's $300.  $300.  That's so crazy.  Let's go to Matt in Cleveland.  Matt?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Stop while you're ahead. 
[03:39:30]  SWG is dead anymore.  Don't even bother with it.  No, you know something?  It really was, and I was off of it for quite a while, and then I got the jump to light speed,  and it's pretty cool.  I'm kind of digging it again, and I'm noticing other people were coming back to it, so I'm  giving it a try again.  Screw it.  I'll tell you what.  Take your time.  Put it into WoW.  You'll find me later.  Oh, yeah.  World of Warcraft.  I know.  I've heard good things about that.  All right.  But then I heard good things about that frigging Cities of Heroes, and that stunk. 
[03:40:00]  Well, Cities of Villains is coming out soon here anyway.  Yeah.  That game blew it for me.  Very monotonous.  Ant, have you ever spent more than three hours playing a video game?  Holy shit.  Three hours?  It does that in his sleep.  Three hours is a rush.  I don't even sit down for three hours.  Yeah.  Three hours?  I can play the entire time.  I'm not here.  Anthony, I can play.  No problem.  How many hours are in your day?  Because I'm starting to add it up in my head.  Let me think.  You do at least six, seven hours of gaming a day. 
[03:40:30]  Then you have to, you know, keep up on your knowledge.  17 hours is my whole day.  17 hours?  I am conscious for 17 hours a day, four of which are spent here.  The rest goes to games.  And some research.  Every so often I'll shut down the game and go, I'm interested in this subject.  Do you have sex, too, somewhere in there?  Oh, that's, of course.  All right.  Nice.  Let's go to... 
[03:41:00]  Hope that big delicious thing isn't going to waste.  Let's go to Mika, Micah.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  What's your name, first of all?  It's Micah.  Micah, what's up?  Micah.  No, not the mic.  Hi, I'm Baba.  This is Billa and Peter.  Oh, man.  All right, what's up?  He goes, you hear him.  Oh, man.  You sound like a real cocksucker.  I got out of Galaxies about a year ago, but I made about $10,000 out of that game in real  life cash selling in-game credits.  In real life?  Yes.  All through PayPal.  So you would get a bunch of money in the game, a bunch of credits. 
[03:41:30]  Yep.  And then go online and say selling one million credits for...  For usually about $10 or $12.  For $10 or $12, and you've sold...  I sold over $10,000.  Whether it was accounts or credits, I sold over $10,000 worth of real life cash of stuff  in that game.  Quickly, without getting into boring details, how would you make that much money online  in the game?  In the game?  Very easily.  Especially with Star Wars, where you can do such high-level crafting and so much crafting  at once.  When Jump to Lightspeed came out by selling the stuff for Starships and stuff like that,  I made basically about 1.8 billion credits in about a week. 
[03:42:00]  Where'd you get your resources?  We had a lot of accounts.  We set up tons of Harvesters and just dumped it all down at once.  Jesus.  It's a conspiracy.  There's organized crime going on in these games.  There's a mafia of the game.  All right, real fast.  Anthony and Jersey, we're running out of show here.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I was just saying that a lot of people that I know buy a currency on eBay for in-game.  I play WoW, and they have the super elite mount, and it's 1,000 gold, and I don't really  have too much time to play with work and a girlfriend, so I went online. 
[03:42:30]  I went to the website.  I found my server, and I purchased the 1,000 gold, and then within five minutes, I had  this woman from Korea call me, confirming my order while I'm at work.  The next thing I know, I get mailed the money in-game.  I come home.  I log on.  I have $1,000 from some crazy character, because they can never spell out real names.  It's all like J-H-H-J-K.  So your whole transaction took place through Korea?  Well, you know, not really, but basically, what we say is, me and my friends, that we 
[03:43:00]  all have sponsored children in Korea.  That's where our money went to.  We adopted a child who gave us 1,000 gold in World of Warcraft.  God, I had no idea this was going on.  No clue.  Yeah, the whole industry.  It's all over the place.  The whole industry.  Impulsive.  How much is that?  $850.  $850 for a Dark Jedi Knight?  I might have to buy a Jedi.  You're not buying a Jedi.  I'm kidding, of course.  Let's buy a Jedi, Ant.  I'm not going to buy a Jedi.  It'll waste four months.  You know why?  Because the newbies buy something, and then you can tell they bought it, because they stink 
[03:43:30]  with the weapons.  They get up there, and they just stink up the joint.  Wanted to get people killed on missions.  All right, we have time for a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony  program?  Ben's raw ass.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to say, today I learned that the limping Jamaican was dead throughout the  whole movie.  Punching out.  From very early in the show.  Yeah, sure.  Kenji, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, Feather Cheeks. 
[03:44:00]  Hi.  Hey, today I learned two words.  Angelina, gaping.  Gaping.  A little handful of lard for you.  Bye-bye now.  Well, Tekatan, I guess, from Cleveland, he didn't learn what causes gravity.  What didn't you learn today?  Yeah.  I guess that's about it, right?  Yeah, that's about it.  That's sort of educational.  I learned we didn't get Bob Saget.  Yeah.  What happened there?  Blew us off.  Blew us off. 
[03:44:30]  Bob Saget blew us off.  All right.  Why do I think that there's...  Was there a show there's no mistake in the scheduling?  There wasn't, like, a mix-up?  Jimmy, real fast, why don't you plug your Dallas gig?  I'm doing a tonight show this Monday, and then the following Thursday, Friday, Saturday  is Dallas Improv, Addison Improv.  And I think the week after that is the State Theater in Virginia.  All right.  We'll see you there.  And then I have to...  This concludes our podcast. </pre>
