<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion ranking the Beatles' solo careers, featuring vulgar descriptions of Yoko Ono's appearance contrasted with Paul McCartney's, and a debate on the musical merits of Lennon and McCartney's post-Beatles work.  This segued into a graphic, sexually explicit analysis of Shakira's "She Wolf" music video, with slow-motion examination of her dance moves accompanied by crude jokes.  The show then moved to a scathing critique of Susan Boyle's appearance on America's Got Talent,  comparing her to the Elephant Man and contrasting her unexpected success with the sales of a Beatles box set.  Other tangents included commentary on Kevin Skinner's "America's Got Talent" win, opera, cable buffering, Chris Daughtry, a planned Patrick Swayze tribute, a video of Fez dressed as Hitler,  Anthony's upcoming stand-up shows, and sexually explicit commentary on the actresses from Sex and the City.

The show continued with a highly offensive and sexually explicit discussion of the Sex and the City movie, focusing on a flashback scene and the actresses' appearances, using graphic comparisons to feces and derogatory terms. This segment also included celebrity gossip about Jennifer Aniston, Gerard Butler, Nancy Reagan, Burt Reynolds, and Selena Gomez, delivered with similarly crude language. A significant portion focused on graphic descriptions of a YouTube series about the Compton Crips gang, using racial slurs and offensive language.  The deaths of Henry Gibson, Mary Travers, and other celebrities were also mentioned, interspersed with more celebrity gossip and offensive remarks.  A caller mistakenly attributed a Laugh-In line to the wrong actor, and the segment concluded with a preview of prank calls.

The next segment started with a nonsensical discussion about *The Birds*, followed by a debate on which comedians performed better as phone versus in-studio guests (mentioning Jay Mohr, Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neal, Colin Quinn, Kevin Smith, and Michael Madsen). The hosts expressed concern over a potentially controversial segment ("the Leonard bit" or "the McDonald's bit") for their "worst of the week" countdown.  A Seinfeld trivia game led to a discussion of Larry David.  News items covered included the upcoming execution of the D.C. sniper, Linda McMahon's Senate run, and Jessica Simpson's dog's death, prompting discussion of an automated lost pet alert service.  A significant portion featured a compilation of poorly executed caller prank calls, interspersed with the hosts' commentary.  Finally, clips from Wendy Williams' show were played, followed by a phone call from Joel McHale, who explained his absence due to a *Today Show* appearance and discussed reality TV stars' hunger for publicity.

A later segment began with a discussion of Kanye West's apology to Taylor Swift and a humorous reminiscence about a previous show dedicated to menstruation.  Future segment ideas, including one about pre-cum, were also jokingly mentioned.  Guest Joel McHale discussed *Community*, praising Chevy Chase and mentioning Ken Jeong, and promoted his film, *The Informant*. He also discussed his new look and waxing routine.  A heated debate with a listener, Adam, ensued, criticizing Opie and Anthony's perceived one-sided political commentary, focusing on Barack Obama, Van Jones, ACORN, and media bias.  The segment concluded with discussion of a supermarket employee licking chickens and an alleged on-air slip-up by Ernie Anastas.

The final segment discussed the effectiveness of debate, contrasting liberal and conservative viewpoints. Opie stated his support for liberal social causes using strong language.  A listener email criticizing the show as boring prompted an extended, vulgar, and violent rant against the listener, "Janitor Pants."  The segment briefly mentioned comedian Jimmy's upcoming shows and the hostsâ€™ use of a "barometer" to assess listener engagement. A caller, Jake, was cut short before the segment ended.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's do it, buddy!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning to everybody.  Yes, Mace is illegal in New York.  Mace is illegal in New York?  There's questions that pop up every so often.  I like to answer it.  Who's your favorite Beatle?  Let me think.  I would probably...  I don't want to be trendy and say John.  I think John's solo shit  kind of sucked.  There's a couple of good things there, 
[00:00:30]  but for the most part, it's like...  You're not a fan of Imagine?  I just think of him always singing to Yoko.  Like, just every song he wrote  after the Beatles was him  singing and professing his love to that mess.  Do you really believe Yoko broke up the Beatles  or that John was kind of just sick of the whole thing  and wanted to do something different?  I think Yoko was a catalyst.  Yeah, I think Yoko was like a catalyst  to breaking up the Beatles.  Look at the horrible ass on Yoko.  We're looking at nude pictures of John and Yoko. 
[00:01:00]  That is enragingly bad.  And that's a young Yoko.  Young Yoko.  Yoko.  Yes.  And her ass is horrid.  Fucking terrible.  It is the flattest ass.  She should be on Quincy's boat.  She's got a very long crack for a female.  Female crack shouldn't be that long, right?  No?  I don't think so.  No, no.  Rick Shapiro has a funny term for awful asses.  Rick talks about his own ass.  He said he has Alan Alda ass, which is a very funny way of describing an awful ass.  Awful ass.  But that's the only thing I can think of. 
[00:01:30]  Yes.  Her cheek, like from the face where they're facing back, her right cheek is just tiny and  it indents.  It's fucking terrible.  It is a lack of it.  It's like they cut open her butt cheeks and pulled out whatever makes your ass, like,  come out.  Whatever makes your ass bubble like that, they've removed it from Yoko.  You ever see her boobies, though?  Ugh.  They were pretty big.  They were fucking flappy saggies.  She had pretty big boobies.  And a giant muff.  A giant muff.  It was the time, Anthony. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, my God.  It was the time.  She should spray some Agent Orange and defoliate that fucking mess between her legs.  It was the time.  What do you want from her?  Look at that muff.  Oh, God.  Looks like she's wearing a bathing suit bottom.  They just loved fucking being naked, those two.  Mm-hmm.  Ew.  They loved a lot of hair.  Yoko, take your clothes off.  Look at that.  That hair is a mess.  Jesus.  How'd they not get locked together like Velcro when they fucked? 
[00:02:30]  She did have nice dark areolas.  Oh, but they're pointing down.  It's hard to say.  She'll have big nipples, too.  God, she just, ugh.  No wonder they had so many STDs back then.  You gave all the bugs an environment to live in.  Look at all those freaking bushes.  His penis looks awful.  That really is nasty.  Yeah.  She should absolutely be throwing a pointy hat in a helicopter.  Well, Anthony, I ask this because Paul McCartney has voted America's favorite Beatle in  a new poll.  Well, you know what?  I am not a big fan of Paul McCartney, and especially some of his recent stuff. 
[00:03:00]  Some of his 80s stuff was very...  Oh, you've got to be a fan of this.  Thank you.  With his ukulele.  He plays the ukulele.  No one does.  He got bored.  What else was he supposed to do?  Be a Beatle.  Just continue being a Beatle?  Yeah.  Do something.  The 80s, you know, when he's making that hokey fucking shit with Michael Jackson and all  that.  That was terrible.  But let me tell you something.  In the 70s, like after the Beatles, he had a pretty good solo career. 
[00:03:30]  He had some pretty good poppy stuff with wings.  Wings.  And then, you know, he just kind of got irrelevant, I guess.  But as far as musically goes, I've got to give it to Paul McCartney.  Over Lennon?  Really?  No way.  No way.  Yeah.  That's because you're into pop music.  And it's close, especially Beatles-wise.  It's very close.  But the whole picture.  Well, you know what?  Afterwards, after the Beatles, John Lennon was all suck-ass. 
[00:04:00]  Hold on.  You just turned me around.  I mean, I'm a big Lennon fan, but I think you do have to give it to Paul McCartney.  Yeah.  He had a lot of hits with Wings.  Yeah.  A lot.  Yeah.  And his solo, just the McCartney album that came out right after.  It was just called McCartney.  What was on that?  I'm not sure.  I have a rundown on what was on McCartney.  McCartney never did one song that was better than Working Class Hero.  Honestly, as a solo artist, which is Lennon, Working Class Hero is fucking amazing.  Paul McCartney had a lot of great little pop ditties with Wings. 
[00:04:30]  Wings' greatest hits, I still put that in.  Yeah?  And there's not a bad song on there.  What are some of their songs?  Oh, my God.  Maybe I'm Amazed at the way you've been.  That's a good song.  Yeah, Maybe I'm Amazed is good.  Live and Let Die.  I'm going, yeah.  James Bond.  We're so sorry.  I wasn't a big Uncle Albert.  I wasn't a big Uncle Albert.  Like, listen to this shit.  Come on.  Listen to this.  Okay. 
[00:05:00]  Here it comes.  Listen to these haunting fucking vocals.  Do they start soon?  No, totally.  Tootie, tootie, tootie, tootie, tootie, tootie.  This is great.  It is good, but the piano and just him singing.  This is better than fucking, you know, that John and Yoko.  We All Shine On is a fucking good Lennon song.  I'm not saying it was all shit.  That is good.  We All Shine On is a good fucking tune.  Imagine is an amazing Lennon song.  Wow.  You know what?  Imagine is... 
[00:05:30]  It's overplayed, but it's still a great tune.  Yeah, yeah, maybe that's why.  No, man.  It just says that we could all be one in this world.  Why?  Imagine no pubic hair.  That's a nice dream.  Yeah.  That's a nice dream to have.  No religions.  No colors.  No country.  No countries.  No hats.  No hats.  I just threw that one in.  No hats.  Imagine he just ruins his song with no hats.  It's all profound and everything until...  Why no hats?  Yes, imagine the rain hitting our eyes because of no hats.  This is good. 
[00:06:00]  Here's the difference between...  It's hard to argue the Lennon solo career with the McCartney solo career because they  were so different.  Yes, one ended with a butt.  The careers...  Surely.  The careers...  Their music was so different after the Beatles.  It's really tough to kind of argue it.  You got to see, I think, how the collaboration of the two worked really well with the Beatles  is why.  And then individually, it's like anything else.  Some people like John Lennon and hate Paul McCartney's music and then vice versa.  I lay in the middle somewhere. 
[00:06:30]  I think John Lennon's stuff, some of it was good after the Beatles, but for the most part,  I like Paul's stuff better until the hokey fucking, you know, 80s where the MTV videos  of him and fucking Michael Jackson riding on the old wagon with the medicine and...  All right.  Well, here's the question.  Here's the question, maybe for the audience, because I don't think we're going to get it.  What was the last Paul McCartney song that was cool that most people that kind of listened  to our show, I guess, liked?  That if you played it, you wouldn't be made fun of. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  How far back do we have to go?  Because the last few albums, I would bet most of our audience would not be listening to.  No.  You should go up to like 1980.  I mean, it's hard to do that, but we're right in that area because that was when letting  it shut.  Well, how do we go backwards?  No.  All right.  Let's suck.  I don't even think, I don't think McCartney had a song after 1985 that anyone cared about.  That anyone gave a shit about?  Like in our demo, meaning our show and whatnot.  Yeah.  Wait, Ebony and Ivory?  See that?  Yeah, yeah.  Like that shit?  No.  You'd have to go before that. 
[00:07:30]  You can't, you couldn't go with your rockin' friends and play Ebony and Ivory without them  beating you senseless.  You could throw a Wings CD in.  Yeah, yeah.  And people are going to be like, all right, right on.  But yeah.  Not my friends.  Florentine would spit on me if I put a Wings CD in.  But you're in a, you're like, you're not like, you know.  My friends and I rock up.  Yeah.  You guys rock a little harder.  And then this is the guy that fucking did Maybe I'm Amazed.  And Yesterday.  Anytime he hooked up with a Negro, I didn't like it. 
[00:08:00]  I hate the way they say piano.  Piano!  And people are yelling, talk about George.  Hold on a minute.  Who?  George Harrison.  Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Yes, gentlemen?  Hi, Joe.  Hi, Chris.  How are you?  Hey, there.  What's up?  Don't get me wrong.  McCartney, Lennon, it's fantastic.  You can't get over it.  Yes, I understand.  But what about Harrison?  Traveling Wilburys?  Shut up.  A couple little shitty singles.  You know something?  I did like some George Harrison stuff, especially when he hooked up with the guy from ELO. 
[00:08:30]  Who was that?  That produced his stuff?  I checked out.  What happened?  Exactly.  Nobody.  No, I really did.  But I'll help you out.  What happened?  All right.  George Harrison.  Yeah, okay.  When he hooked up with the guy from ELO to produce his shit, and it kind of almost had  an ELO-ish sound to some of his music.  The Traveling Wilburys thing?  No, it was before Wilburys.  The, oh.  The ELO.  Jeff Flynn.  Thank you.  Okay.  See, Kevin from Connecticut. 
[00:09:00]  Fuck!  I didn't know one.  The shit right there.  I love how I just blurt things out, and then people just tell me.  Yeah.  That's how they do it on sports radio, by the way.  Those guys don't know half that shit.  Oh, I know.  They got a master computer where a bunch of guys, like, throwing stats at them.  Oh, it's awful.  You know, what was the Yankees batting average in 1972?  Hey, dog.  Oh, you're not here anymore.  And somebody punches it up.  It just pops up.  It pops up.  We actually watched Mad Dog just blurt out stats from fucking 20 years ago. 
[00:09:30]  He might be the rain man of sports radio.  He really is.  He's the rain man of a lot of other things, even without the sports knowledge.  He's an insane person.  You know what?  He could pull his pants down a little bit, though.  Yeah.  We don't need to see his fucking male camel toe.  Pull your pants down a little bit there.  Mad Dog is all cock.  It's common knowledge.  He's embarrassed by it.  It's a sport of shame for him.  People just point at it.  Louisville Slugger.  He's stealing.  He's a little too close to the belly button with his pants.  Pull him down slightly.  Hey, what about... 
[00:10:00]  Oh, so George Harrison, what about him, Chris?  I was just saying, everyone's talking about McCartney and Lennon.  No one's bringing up Harrison.  He had a pretty good career.  He was bringing up to the Beatles.  I don't know if he'd suck a dick, but, you know, Harrison was great.  Apparently Buck from Illinois, he has a little trivia for us.  Buck.  Buck.  Hello.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Yeah, George Harrison had the first number one song after the Beatles broke up.  Who would have thunk that one, huh? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  What was it?  I can't remember the name of the song right now.  What was one of George Harrison's...  I don't know when all that happened, but...  I'm sorry, man.  I didn't mean to step on you.  What was one of George Harrison's solo songs?  I mean, I know his stuff, but I don't.  Well, he had that one song...  My Sweet Lord, which he got sued for.  Yeah, he had My Sweet Lord.  Why?  Because it was...  By God?  Do lang, do lang, do lang.  It was...  He's so fine.  That song sucks.  If you play...  If you play...  Yeah, this is common knowledge.  If you play this...  You play My Sweet Lord, and then He's So Fine. 
[00:11:00]  Uh, yeah, you can see that he ripped it off.  This is his Hare Krishna phase, where it was a Hare Krishna.  And at the end, it kind of looked like a Hare Krishna.  No hair.  You don't like this?  A little spout coming out of his head.  You gotta slow down your rock a little bit, Jim.  I like fucking...  I love Leonard Skinner, and I like a lot of the...  My Sweet Lord...  This is okay.  Steve from Bayshore.  The corks in my ears hold the pudding in. 
[00:11:30]  That was his song?  I don't remember that one.  It must have been later in his career.  So anyway...  Yeah, you'd listen to this a little bit.  But no one can come up with the last cool McCartney song that...  No.  ...that our audience would say...  Yeah, they listened to.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I think it might...  I think it might have ended with Wings, and then he went kind of more into the pop world,  where it was more like, I don't know, females.  Female fans.  I think with the advent of MTV, I think that destroyed Paul McCartney, because he was making... 
[00:12:00]  He had a lot of money backing, and was doing these duets with people, and the 80s MTV video  thing...  You know what just...  Ugh.  They were all douchey.  You know what destroyed Paul McCartney?  Time.  How long is he supposed to do it for?  Give the guy a break.  Forever.  If Lennon was still alive, I'm sure he'd be playing some ukulele or something.  You think?  Yeah, it would have got kind of hokey with him, too. 
[00:12:30]  I don't hate this song, even though I really want to.  I could tell Jimmy would like this.  The video's terrible.  He'd listen a little bit.  Him and that fucking...  Him and that spotted idiot running around selling elixir.  Elixir.  What is this?  It's Jesus juice.  Puts it right to sleep, doesn't it, Mike?  Behind that fucking wagon, just banging a boy in the asshole.  Creeps.  Creeps.  Say, say, say, ouch.  This is 83, this song? 
[00:13:00]  What about Wonderful Christmas Time by McCartney?  This does stink, by the way.  I hate that one.  Yeah.  What is that one?  I don't know it.  Can we hear that?  Is that having a wonderful Christmas time?  It's so bad.  I can't get...  That's when MTV started just...  I can't hit off quickly enough if this comes on during Christmas.  That's when MTV just started creating Christmas music.  New Christmas music for everybody.  Out of nowhere.  Like, the old stuff wasn't good enough anymore.  Well, you know what?  They had a lot of the newer artists of the time that were making Christmas songs. 
[00:13:30]  Every fucking artist that was on MTV was told to get a Christmas song together.  What about fucking...  Christmas time is 1979?  Fuck.  What's the last Paul McCartney song that was cool?  This is horrible.  No one has it.  This is okay.  I don't hate this.  What was the last Wings album?  Let's go back there.  At least we have a...  Purple.  Yeah.  You're right.  This sucks.  I apologize.  It's got the background music of Detachable Penis.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Wow, wow, wow. 
[00:14:00]  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  That's Hawaii.  Oh.  All right.  Whatever.  If you guys get the answer to the Paul McCartney question, that'd be nice.  Yeah.  We just don't have it.  No.  I think it ended with Wings.  It could.  I think people want to hope it didn't, but I think it did.  Yeah, he had some hits after that.  I think you're right.  Nothing that we would download to our iPhones or whatever.  No.  I want...  You guys know who Shakira is, right?  Yeah, of course.  Shakira?  Shakira was...  I hear the kids enjoy her. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  I know this is kind of coming out of left field, but I watched the finale of America's Got Talent last night.  Yeah.  And Shakira was performing.  And that made me check out the Shakira video for SheWolf.  Oh, yeah?  Holy mother of God.  Hotness?  Holy mother of God.  That'd be merry.  And my tweet was simple.  I said, if you like putting boners in girls' poopers...  That was my tweet last night. 
[00:15:00]  I said, immediately watch Shakira's SheWolf video.  You gotta see the position she puts her body in.  Really?  Oh, my God.  All right.  It's very, very sexy.  She's walking around.  You can kind of see her a little bit while she is.  Do you think she's hot?  Yeah, I think she's a sexy...  Watch what she does to her body in SheWolf.  And you can play along at home.  I know this is radio.  She's wearing like half pants.  Find the fucking video.  Her ass is fantastic.  Watch what she does to this ass.  Those are sexy pants.  I mean, she's dancing like a kind of a weird, like, old school robot. 
[00:15:30]  Herky-jerky robot.  Herky-jerky.  Look at that.  Stop it.  Thank you.  Freeze that.  Thank you.  Freeze that.  I gotta jerk off.  Not the rock part, Danny.  There you go.  No.  Oh, my God.  Freeze that.  She's in a cage.  Thank you.  Now you understand.  She's in a cage.  Holy fuck.  Thank you.  Stop it.  Her ass rose up like a souffle.  Yeah.  You know why the ass is rising there, right, Ant? 
[00:16:00]  Why?  She's getting ready for boners.  Fuck boner.  She's getting ready for a boner.  That would be a face would be buried in there.  Wait.  Go back to that one position, though.  Where she's got her leg.  She was here the other day.  What?  No, she wasn't.  That's serious.  Yes, she was.  Why would she be on our show?  Go to the other one, Danny.  Where her leg is kind of pushed all the way forward.  It was the first move she made in the cage.  First move.  Oh, shit.  That wasn't it either.  That wasn't it either, but that was amazing.  It was way back in the beginning. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, you just.  All right.  Play it out from here.  Okay.  She's doing a little robot thing.  Whatever.  There.  There.  Right there.  Holy cock.  Wait a minute.  Do you know.  I would fucking slide into that like it's second base.  I would just fucking slide in face first.  How ridiculous is that move?  She's juicy legs.  It could be the greatest move a female's ever done. 
[00:17:00]  Look at where her arm is.  She wrapped her foot around.  I can't even describe this fucking position.  She looks like she's crawling.  One leg.  Her left leg is way back and her right leg is like a cat.  She's like a cat.  It looks like a position a monster would be in the ring.  She's one of those fast motion monsters.  What makes it great, too.  She's wearing a bodysuit.  So it looks like she's flesh colored.  So she's not wearing clothes.  She looks completely naked.  Yeah.  Her ass is exquisite.  Exquisite.  Ridiculous. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Continue the video.  Quite amazing.  Is that good, Ant?  Damn it.  Is that good?  Yes.  You like the ass rising?  I like that.  A lot better than this fucking herky-jerky.  Yeah, the herky-jerkies, whatever.  Wearing the Frank Gorshin from Star Trek suit.  Yeah.  Wow.  Her ass.  She's wearing half pants where the one cheek and leg are totally exposed.  The other one's covered.  God damn it.  She's dishy.  I can say that.  You know what?  If she just laid there in bed, it would be a great fuck, but you think she does that 
[00:18:00]  stuff?  Yeah.  I think she wraps around and looks and goes.  I think she's Cuban, right?  Yeah.  She's not.  There's no way she lays there again.  Cubano?  Yeah.  She's sexy, man.  Cubans are dirty.  Oh, damn it.  Look at the ass, right?  The ass comes up like a cat.  You know when a cat, when you scratch a cat's back all the way from neck to like tail,  and they slowly put their ass up?  That's what Shakira did.  She's like, put your boner here.  She is crawling around in this cage.  It makes me want to cage a girl up. 
[00:18:30]  I don't.  Again.  I don't even know if the song is good.  I don't really care.  I wasn't listening to it.  I mean, I'll listen to a pop song every once in a while.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  Yeah, see, now we're doing it the right way.  We're just watching the video without the song playing.  Danny, you're an ass, man.  Everybody knows that.  It might be a little.  End that statement.  It might be a little too small for Danny.  You're an ass, man.  It might be a little too small for Danny.  What do you think?  I'm telling you.  What do you think, Danny?  I say it's a little too small.  Come on, Danny.  Hips don't lie, gentlemen.  That's right.  He wants to fuck Wycliffe. 
[00:19:00]  No, she's definitely delicious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's on the small side of my particular taste scale, but it's definitely fine.  That's fine with me.  You like a little extra meat there, though.  I do.  Let me tell you something.  I don't like a lot of extra meat, but I am an ass, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Damn it.  Now, this is good.  You listen to this song and you watch Shakira.  Yeah.  You know what?  Everybody.  Woo. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, God.  As Shakira's in the cage, you know what I want to do?  Right.  Not well.  Yeah, I would kick.  You shove him.  Stick him.  Love the funnel.  Yep.  I love to watch him.  Uh-huh.  I love to pick him.  And now what?  And I'm going to kick him.  Why?  Coming up.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I'm an ass, man.  Wow, she is fucking...  She looks great in this video.  Metallica should redo ass, man, I'm thinking.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:20:00]  I'm an ass, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm an ass, man.  That'd be great.  Ass, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This fucking Shakira video, though.  Good God.  Yeah.  All right.  Video of the day, Ope.  Thank you, Anthony.  Christ almighty.  See?  I watch some of these douchey shows, and I get radio material.  Yeah.  America's Got Talent.  She was on.  The live version of She-Wolf that she did last night was pretty fucking good.  Pretty good?  She can knock shit over with her hips. 
[00:20:30]  You know that move where a girl kind of just does that, but the rest of her body doesn't move?  Just the hip moves.  And then, look.  She goes back to sleep.  Yeah.  She had a wild little night, and then she just lays her head on the pillow and goes to sleep.  She's a She-Wolf ant.  The end.  Yeah, yeah.  She knows that morning's coming soon.  Full moon.  She goes wild.  Yes.  Oh, I'd love it.  I would like to see her try to hit baseballs with her ass.  Ah.  My balls with her ass would be really nice, but baseballs too, sure. 
[00:21:00]  Well, I guess we seg into America's Got Talent.  Mm-hmm.  The guy that I turned you on to won the whole fucking thing, who Jimmy hated.  Who was the guy?  Oh.  Remember Kevin Skinner, that guy?  And you're like, ugh.  Why'd I hate him?  He had his first appearance just really was just moving for a lot of people.  Why was it moving?  And I tried to bring it to the show, and you were like, this is terrible.  Did I think it was lackluster?  Yeah, he did.  But he won the whole thing.  He was the chicken catcher.  You remember him?  Chicken catcher? 
[00:21:30]  Kevin Skinner.  Oh, oh, oh.  That was his job, right?  Yeah.  And he was some hillbilly guy.  Yeah, unemployed chicken catcher.  Yeah, the hillbilly.  Yes.  And he came out and sang a Garth Brooks song?  He did a Garth Brooks song.  That's the one I remember singing.  He did a couple songs.  I don't watch the program.  I don't watch it.  He did, you were always on my mind.  You were always on my mind.  Really?  And then he did Amazing by Aerosmith. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, right.  But he won the whole fucking thing.  He beat the Opera Broad.  Who should have won?  Some Opera Broad.  Oh, the Opera Broad.  I saw the Opera Broad.  You did?  Yeah.  Not enough.  Falsetto?  Appeal.  No, not enough popular appeal.  People aren't really into opera.  You know, you can respect and appreciate the talent of the person, but you're like, I'm  not going to listen to this shit.  You ever go see an opera?  Yes.  I was going to go, no.  And then I'm like, yes, I think I did.  I saw one down at the Met. 
[00:22:30]  I was going to say, don't laugh at us out there.  When you get a little older, trust me, you'll be dragged to an opera one time in your life.  I was dragged to La Boheme.  It's a guarantee you'll be dragged to one in your lifetime.  Yeah.  Is that the biggest horse shit?  I got to say, the set was amazing.  It was fabulous.  La Bohomo.  No, it was La Boheme.  Look, man.  Jimmy, you ever been dragged to an opera? 
[00:23:00]  If you're on acid.  Wow.  No.  That's a good, imagine that, an opera on acid might make it fun.  Here's the problem with opera.  Mescalon.  You're trying to follow the story, but they're singing the whole time, which makes it very  confusing.  And how about in a foreign fucking language?  Right.  They sing that too.  And there's some murderer, and instead of just killing the broad, he's...  You know what they did?  What?  You know what they did?  They have it at the Met here in New York.  If you're going to see an opera, you got to go to the Met. 
[00:23:30]  It was all in foreign language, you know?  It's all fucking foreigners singing in a foreign language.  What language is it?  I think it was Italian or something.  I have no idea.  But subtitles.  I'm going to go with Gaelic.  Subtitles right there in front of you, on the seat.  On the seat in front of you.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So you're fucking watching this opera, and you can understand what they're saying because  you're reading subtitles, which was kind of cool because I'm like, yeah, I like the  music.  I can appreciate their singing, and the set was giant, fucking really cool looking and 
[00:24:00]  everything.  But if I didn't have that, I wouldn't know what the fuck they were doing.  So cool that you've gone back, right?  Oh, no.  No, I've never been back.  I could barely...  Uh-oh.  What's happening?  What?  That was me.  I was doing my high note.  Oh, no. 
[00:24:30]  I am so mature.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, Christ.  Now bring it down a little bit.  Get this shit off. 
[00:25:00]  Why?  These are the birds.  Yeah, and then some fucking body comes out and represents like a dog.  He represents the dog.  What?  No, ears, tail.  This is silly.  Anyway, so Kevin Skinner won it all last night on America's Got Talent, but this pig, Susan  Boyle, came out.  Yeah.  She looks like the fucking elephant man in this picture.  Where's the picture of her today in the paper?  She looks like John Merrick.  Yeah.  I'm afraid. 
[00:25:30]  They're making a huge mistake with Susan Boyle.  Like God did?  Well, the frumpy look she had kind of goes with the whole thing.  And now they're trying to make her like all glammed up.  They gave her a makeover and it just makes her look stupid.  She's got to look like an old school marm.  Yeah, absolutely.  She can't be gussied up.  But Hollywood doesn't understand that.  They got to polish everything.  Stop polishing everything.  And you know what?  I bet when all was said and done and they put the last bit of detailing on her as far 
[00:26:00]  as makeup or hair or dress, people were just going, you look beautiful.  Yeah, of course.  She doesn't look like the fucking elephant man in this Daily News picture.  That head.  She's fucking John Merrick.  She's got a big head.  She should be singing through a burlap bag with a hole in it.  She's fucking horrendous.  And you know what?  Now that you've been discovered by the world, I don't know, how about you get rid of a few  of your skin tags?  Oh, God.  Did you see all the skin tags on her shoulder?  It's an English thing.  They're big, eh?  They're big.  Are they?  Oh, really? 
[00:26:30]  Like another head.  They get in the way when you're trying to put a shirt on or something or a bra on.  Does a big necklace hang up on one on her neck?  It's like hangs up.  Oh, God.  Just take a nail clipper and eliminate it.  You could clip those things these days.  Can you?  Just clip them yourself.  Yes!  You can clip a skin tag?  There's no reason to live with skin tags anymore.  Have you ever had one?  You take your fucking nail clipper and you put a fucking lighter under it.  You heat it up after a few beers.  I may have had a little one that was just starting on my neck about 10 years ago. 
[00:27:00]  I knew it was good.  You know what it was?  I knew it was going to turn into one.  That was the thing.  Because it started becoming like, as a kid, it's just kind of sitting there as a beauty  mark on your neck.  Looks like a little freckle.  Yeah, it's a little freckle.  And then you start getting a little older and it's like, it's becoming 3D.  It's getting 3D.  And then you just take the nail clipper and go.  And it bleeds like a motherfucker.  You take a tissue, you slam it on there, and then you just take another shot of Jack 
[00:27:30]  Daniels and you did your own little self-surgery.  Oh.  And then you eat it.  A lot of protein in that skin tag.  You wouldn't do that, but I would.  No, I would not.  I would certainly eat my own skin tag.  See, you're lucky that you don't have the freckles.  Because when you get older, the freckles all...  They become 3D?  Yeah, they all take on a life of their own.  They just decide they need to show themselves.  And see the world a little bit.  See the world.  Hey, what's going on up there?  Yeah, they decide to... 
[00:28:00]  They pop out like a little fucking...  They decide to stand up a little bit and take a look.  You're right.  Fucking mole removal.  Like a prairie dog coming out.  Oh, what's going on up here?  Mole removal rules.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you're a band out there, you're looking for a name, Mole Removal.  Mole removal.  Mole removal.  There probably is a band named Mole Removal.  Probably.  So anyway, this Susan Boyle...  Freckles become feelers.  That's what Steve from Bayshore is saying.  Yuck.  This Susan Boyle performed in America for the first time last night on America's Got Talent.  After Shakira, by the way. 
[00:28:30]  Everyone was like, holy shit, look at this Shakira.  And then Susan Boyle walks out.  Wow.  And she's got the number one album in pre-sales there.  Travis, what's that about?  Well, you pretty much said it.  She has the number one album.  What's that about?  There's really nowhere to go from there.  Well, actually...  On Amazon.  No, I didn't pretty much say it.  I'm going to defend myself.  Her album is the number one album in what, America?  Amazon.com.  Amazon.com.  And it's not even out yet.  It comes out in November, I guess. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Because there's other albums on there that are out, right?  That's big.  All of them are out, except...  That's big for her.  So, okay, there you go.  Yeah.  So you just explained it.  No, it's a very big deal, yeah.  Absolutely.  She's beating the Beatles.  No.  I was hoping she would bomb horribly.  Well, I love when they say stuff like that.  Of course she's beating the Beatles.  Why?  Well, it's been dead for 28 years.  The Beatles sold 600,000 albums last week.  Yeah, but give them a break.  Look at the price, too.  She sold more than that?  Yeah.  Oh, on Amazon.  Only on Amazon, actually. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, the price of the Beatles box set is 200 bucks.  You could buy this fucking fat slob for 10 bucks.  That is true.  10 bucks.  10 bucks.  That Beatles box set...  Fuck her!  That was number one until Susan Boyle came in.  Like, that's ridiculous.  So many people are buying that.  You know what?  I'm even buying it.  And I was like, it's bullshit, the remastering everything.  And then we listened.  It's just exquisite.  They're great.  It's all I've been listening to.  Wait, do they have the anthology remastered or no?  No, that's not. 
[00:30:00]  It's just the original albums.  Know what we noticed on the...  Don't embarrass me.  Where's that list?  Jimmy, give me that list.  It's in front of you there.  What list?  The one that...  Yeah.  All right, here.  I love unnecessary anger on this show.  Yeah.  It's just somebody tries to be nice and they just get shit on.  It's not being questioned.  I don't like it.  No.  We were talking about this list before the show, the top 20 albums on Amazon.com.  And Zeppelin makes it, again, with an album that's called The Definitive Collection.  And we're trying to figure out what The Definitive Collection means. 
[00:30:30]  What does it mean?  That's basically a Greatest Hits CD.  Well, no, it's all their albums.  It is?  Yeah.  So it's a box set?  It's The Definitive Collection.  If you were able to...  But they already put that out.  You know what, though?  You need it now.  The Beatles did what they did and Led Zeppelin's doing what they're doing but not remastering, right?  No, Led Zeppelin has reissued their albums a lot.  No, enough with Zeppelin.  Plenty of fucking times.  If you took somebody from back in the day where this was all new stuff and then brought 
[00:31:00]  them forward to the year 2009, first of all, they'd be very angry at the lack of flying  cars.  No shit.  Like I would be.  And then they would look and go, why are these motherfuckers still selling albums?  It would be amazing to somebody to go like, what the fuck?  You're absolutely right.  They're still selling albums and people are still buying them.  You know what?  It's stunning.  We got to give up on the whole...  And then you'd say, can I go to the Martian colony? 
[00:31:30]  And they would go, we don't have one.  They'd go, what the fuck?  Speaking of that...  What have you guys been doing?  We got to give up on the flying car thing.  I know.  It ain't happening.  I know.  Let's start rallying the troops for sidewalks that move.  Moving sidewalks.  We could at least get that done before we die.  We can do that.  What the fuck?  Yeah, why not?  That seems like an easy one.  You just jump on.  Yeah.  They kind of have it at the airport.  The airport.  Let's put it on the streets in New York.  Get it outside.  Get it out there.  Well, that'd be great.  Can you imagine?  Not having a walk.  I would like that. 
[00:32:00]  Fantastic.  Dude, how much would that rule?  You got to go 10 blocks and you just pop on and just kind of hanging out.  Yeah.  Looking around.  It'd be a nice little ride for yourself every day.  It wouldn't work all the time.  It'd always be shut down.  You could just stand next to somebody and videotape yourself and look like you're in a Spike Lee movie.  Just drifting along the sidewalk.  That stupid fucking director.  I love Spike Lee.  I hate when he's talking and they're just moving.  I don't like the way he dubs in footsteps, too. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Stop it.  It's weird.  Stop it.  Stop it already.  So, Susan Boyle, let's wrap this up.  It's on a crane.  This is our music break, I guess.  So, Susan Boyle performed for the first time in America.  America's Got Talent last night.  Sexy last name, too.  Boyle.  She's got a lot of them on her body.  She's just atrocious.  And the first song from this album that's going to be released in November, she's redoing Wild Horses, everybody.  Hope the Stones sewer.  For fucking everything.  Tell me, and have an open mind, and tell me, do you like this? 
[00:33:00]  True.  I actually liked this performance, but I would never fucking buy this.  Does that make sense?  Yeah.  You could go like, I appreciate it, but motherfucker.  But I don't need to hear it a million times.  Yeah.  Enough with the fucking tremolo on the voice. 
[00:33:30]  But it's fucking not even that great.  But she sounds so fucking hot.  She's putting it.  When you don't see her, right?  I can't get it out of my head that it's her.  So I don't.  It's amazing.  That voice comes out of that pig.  I listen.  Yeah.  Well, that is true.  That doesn't make sense.  The things that you wanted.  Sounds like she goes, the Yankees win.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[00:34:00]  Well, I bought them for you.  Oh, right.  Braceless lady.  She just jiggles her fat and makes that sound.  She's one of those oldie time weight loss machines with a belt around here.  And she hits a button on that part.  This is very average.  It's not horrendous.  It's just, who cares?  It's going to kick in in a second. 
[00:34:30]  She's just setting up her vocal to have another verse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  White horses  Couldn't drag me away  They couldn't do a Clydesdale's.  White horses  Couldn't drag me away 
[00:35:00]  I watched you  That's enough.  I don't get it.  She's got some range.  It's nice, but  That fucking voice, though.  Jesus.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm not going to download it, but you've got to appreciate the voice.  My God, man.  There's a lot of women I would have rather have heard do that than her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shakira.  You guys didn't watch America's Got Talent, right?  No.  Nine.  Sharon Osbourne's on it, Jimmy. 
[00:35:30]  You should have watched for that alone.  Well, Sharon and I discussed, Susan, backstage when we were talking for 20 minutes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And what did she have to say?  Wasn't good.  Wasn't good?  Wasn't good.  As opposed to good.  Somebody may have said, well, she sings well for a retard.  I'm not saying that she said that, but it might have flown out of somebody's mouth and I might have laughed really fucking hard.  Oh, shit.  How do you not want to be on Sharon's shit list?  No.  No.  Stephen S.  Rabatio writes, she sounds like she has a vibrating egg in her big fat pussy. 
[00:36:00]  Jowls?  I just don't feel like saying that word today.  Why?  Because I've said the word a lot lately.  Call it beaver.  Box.  Right.  I just like to say in her.  Not a rabbit hole.  In her.  Yeah.  Probably a little bigger than a rabbit hole.  My girlfriend likes when I say this, like, you want me to put my mouth on your.  Who's that?  Wild horses have trampled my face. 
[00:36:30]  That's Gordon in Jersey.  And someone's saying it's dog shit.  You can't say that is dog shit.  It might not be your cup of tea, but she's got a fucking talent with that damn voice of hers.  She's dog shit, but.  And just, I just want to put it out there really quickly that the percussion group from Merck  has got talent should have won the whole fucking thing, but, but you didn't really watch  the show.  Percussion group.  Is that the guy that was all like sweaty or wet with something?  Did they involve water? 
[00:37:00]  Uh, yeah.  They did wipe out was their last thing.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I saw a little piece of that.  It's the whole thing.  And what they're, and what they're beating on and stuff.  Yeah.  They should have won the whole thing.  It was a perfect.  Lippy wives.  Well, it was a perfect fucking act for Vegas.  Really?  One of those?  Because the winner goes to Vegas.  Like Blue Man Group?  Yeah.  It sort of had that feel.  You know what I mean?  All right.  I want to say.  You don't want to see Stomp, Anthony?  Uh, no.  It was actually okay.  I don't want to see Stomp.  If you like Stomp, then you might like these guys, because they're kind of like hipping up 
[00:37:30]  like the Stomp thing.  All right.  X, an act who creates music with, well, just about anything they can get their hands on.  They are buffering.  They are the buffers.  For cycle percussion.  All right.  Just hit pause and we'll get back to it.  Yeah.  Hit pause for a second.  Let it load a little.  I hate when things buffer.  Buffering sucks, and it should be a thing of the past.  Yeah.  Why are we still buffering?  Why are we still buffering?  Why?  There should be no buffering.  I don't like buffering. 
[00:38:00]  Speaking of buffering.  My TV doesn't do that.  Mine does.  No, cable vision, yeah.  That is getting to be very annoying, by the way, with some cable outlets.  They're stretching their bandwidth to the limit, and it's having an impact.  You'll be watching a movie, and it'll just freeze up, and then it kind of falls back.  It looks like Tetris for a while.  It looks like you're watching Tetris, and then everything falls back into place.  It happens to you?  Yay.  I thought it was me, because I have a shitty, like, I don't have a good system like you. 
[00:38:30]  Time Warner.  No.  It's everybody.  Time Warner.  Time Warner is so bad.  They're terrible.  I have cable vision, and it's the same thing.  They're stretching it to the limit.  And take it to the limit.  Limit!  I just canceled a whole bunch of service, because I'm sick of paying them for what?  Like, that's the quality I get, and I'm paying how much money for cable service?  I don't know why.  You show them, Dan.  I don't know why I'm paying for the movie channels at this point.  I don't even know why.  You don't need to.  You got Netflix on Instant.  That's all you know.  And the PS3 and all that shit.  But I don't know why I'm paying for it. 
[00:39:00]  I know.  I know.  Because I think I'm going to be into, like, an HBO show or a Showtime show.  So that's why I think I keep it.  Yeah, that's the only reason why I kept it around for as long as I did.  But then I realized the last HBO show that I was watching was The Sopranos.  And that ended how long ago?  The Sopranos got locked in line.  Oh.  I got that on DVD.  But I have it on DVD, Jim.  Is Californication coming back?  Yeah, that starts next weekend, I think.  I kind of like that show, but last season was...  Last season wasn't so good.  No?  Not really.  Did this buffer it off? 
[00:39:30]  I didn't even think it was still on.  This fucking thing isn't buffering on us.  It froze.  It froze.  It froze.  Oh, that computer sucks a dick.  Come on.  Every day.  At least twice a day.  Yeah.  You want to take a break, then?  We could do that.  Whatever.  We don't have to play it.  But this percussion group, I thought, was the perfect act for Vegas.  Fuck him in the ass.  Because Kevin Skinner, there's better singers out there.  He's going to have a Vegas show?  That's a little weird.  It's just him and a guitar.  Yeah.  He's no Chris Daughtry.  I didn't like his voice.  I did hear clips of it. 
[00:40:00]  I don't watch the show, but I hear clips.  You see clips here and there?  I see clips.  I don't like Chris Daughtry either.  I just like him a lot, actually.  I just wish he didn't go so poppy with his stuff.  Poppy.  Poppy.  That just stopped the show.  Oh, my God.  Did it?  I should just shut my fucking mouth.  I should just shut my fucking mouth.  I was trying to contemplate it.  I was contemplating it. 
[00:40:30]  Boy, that'll get the phones ringing.  We'll talk about Chris Daughtry for 10 minutes.  Oh, shoot me.  How about one more time?  We'll do the tribute to Patrick Swayze as we go to break.  Ah, haunting.  Haunting.  And speaking of the phones, the listeners, I hold in my hand a very good surprise for  the listeners.  Oh, a surprise.  Everything we do should be a nice surprise for the listeners, but this is a very special 
[00:41:00]  CD I hold in my hand.  I like surprises.  You want to do it next?  Okay.  It's up to you, Ant.  I'm in.  You want to do this next?  I'm in.  Yeah?  Reveal the surprise for the listeners?  Let's reveal it.  That I hold in my hand?  Yes.  Don't spill coffee on it.  Dude.  Mars was cleaning up coffee all fucking day.  I know.  But you know what?  It's amazing how much coffee came out of that cup.  But that's the end of my streak because Fez came in as Hitler and just fucked us up and  I knocked coffee over it. 
[00:41:30]  I don't know if people understand that happened while Fez was, you know, playing Fat Hitler  yesterday.  Yeah.  And the video doing very well, by the way, on OP Radio.  Yeah.  On YouTube.  Very well.  But I knocked the coffee over because I was trying to get, you know, all sorts of different  angles.  And then Ronnie's fucking abusing my fucking camera technique.  Oh, was he?  Whoa, is Michael J. Fox filming this?  I'm like, well, fuck, I'm filming and trying to talk at the same time.  I'm knocking over coffee.  I'm trying to get behind Anthony.  Yeah, it got a little shaky. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, it got a little shaky.  What do you want from me?  It's a dumb little HD flip.  We don't have a camera crew.  No.  When we see something, we're all fumbling for our video devices and trying to turn them  on as fast as possible.  That you have to now hang on to with, like, your thumb and forefinger as you're kind of,  it's not a stable platform.  That's the curse of the HD flip.  It's so, you're so right.  It's so, it needs to be just slightly heavier.  You can't wrap your hand around it.  It is so, it's like trying to hold a butterfly.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Try to hold a butterfly still.  That's in my new book.  Did you just shape the camera like a big cock?  That way you can wrap your hand around it.  Film in the back of your throat all the time.  All right, let's slow down a little bit.  Yeah.  Oh my God, that's funny.  Tim in Indiana.  Tim.  Yeah, how would you like to see Susan Boyle in a Wild Horses video in that cage raising  that ass up for you?  All right. 
[00:43:00]  Can you imagine Susan Boyle?  You just ruined that image.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Yeah, triple X, Jeff Scogin.  See, that's why Hollywood just sucks.  Oh, no.  I would give Susan Boyle, if I had it, like a couple million dollars to just redo the Shakira  She-Wolf video.  Wow.  That would be everywhere.  That would be...  That would be everywhere.  Horrific.  Why?  Well, who wants to see that ass?  I can't even imagine what her ass looks like.  It's worse than Yoko. 
[00:43:30]  Well, let's talk about it for a second.  Do we have to?  Pockmarks?  Oh, yeah.  She got the...  Like, she sat in a gravel driveway?  Yes.  We've used that...  The cellulite.  A lot of cellulite.  What else is wrong with the ass, you think?  Skin tags.  You think there's skin tags on her ass?  She's got ass skin tags, especially right around her big brown asshole.  That, like, it's...  The brown comes out much too far.  Nothing wrong with a little brown.  Yeah, yeah.  You just don't want it to go too far.  It comes way out.  And there's, like, some coarse hair on it. 
[00:44:00]  It's not long.  I'm not going to go with coarse hair.  No?  Look at her.  She's got, like, facial hair kind of thing.  I'm thinking...  I'm going with a very light layer of very dark hair across the entire ass.  All right.  Yeah, okay.  It almost darkens the ass cheek.  Not patches or anything.  Just...  Just...  Yes.  Just enough where you're like, what the fuck?  And the sides?  A little darker hair.  Would you?  Would you? 
[00:44:30]  Shoot it?  Would you?  You have to do it for a goof.  So you can tell your friends.  For real, would you?  And then, like, no.  Why not?  No.  She's not famous enough to have a celebrity fucking.  Why not?  It's not one of those, all right, well, she's famous.  Dude.  She fucking...  All right, the picture on the right that Danny just showed looked like Jack Black.  I was about to pull up at Jack Black.  It fucking looked like Jack Black.  Is it the funny one he does with the eyebrow raised?  Oh, it's so funny.  Were you here for our... 
[00:45:00]  That guy's good.  You weren't here for our talk on the VMAs, right?  Did you see Jack Black on the VMAs?  Why would I?  No.  Danny, can we find his appearance on the VMAs where he's on the stage?  I gotta play for these guys.  Did he do a funny eyebrow raised?  I'm so sick of the fucking white guy with the eyebrow raised photos.  Stop it.  Jimmy, wait till you see.  Maybe Sam and the guys down the hall could get it real fast.  It's gotta be somewhere by now.  Jack Black giving an award at the VMAs dressed as some kind of, like, superhero with fake muscles. 
[00:45:30]  You gotta see this.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy, you gotta see this.  You gotta see how horrendous this is.  That's funny.  Wow, there you go.  Jack Black and Susan Boyle separated at birth.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Very good.  It's Jack Black with a big, goofy wig on.  You think she's a female?  Yeah, she's awful.  She should be tested.  No, for real.  She has internal testes, I think.  She has internal testes.  She always looks like she's shitting. 
[00:46:00]  She also kind of looks like Stan Laurel.  Laurel and Hardy.  She looks like a combination of both.  She is Laurel and Hardy.  That picture kind of looks like Stan Laurel making the, oh, I'm sorry, only face.  And then she's fat.  All right, we've got a lady die thing going on there.  We've got to find the Jack Black thing.  Oh, wait.  It's got to be a video, though.  So they can't get it down the hall.  See if it's online. 
[00:46:30]  We'll see if it's online.  We'll play it for Jimmy after the break.  It's going to drive Jimmy nuts.  A tribute to Patrick Swayze.  Let's get one more play out of this.  This is Derek and Steve.  The Opie and Anthony Show would like to honor the late, great Patrick Swayze with a tribute  featuring his 1987 hit song from the Dirty Dancing soundtrack, She's Like the Wind.  And now, Patrick Swayze.  A little breath in my face  Her body close to me  Can't look in her eyes 
[00:47:00]  She's out of my league  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Space Hog.  This brings us back to AF, huh, Ant?  Yeah.  A little Space Hog for everybody.  Fucking love this song. 
[00:47:30]  We should play the vocals one day.  Yeah.  Can I jump in real quick to plug the gig I'm doing tonight and tomorrow  because I have bills to pay, which I can't pay because of certain financial situations  where I'm having a cock shoved in my mouth.  Tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday, I will be in Hartford, Connecticut at the Funny Bone  because someone has taxes that are due.  I'm in a fucking bad mood now.  God damn it, I'm in a bad mood.  Ugh.  Sorry.  Why?  Because I know what Jimmy's talking about and we really can't talk about it.  Oh, right. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Boy, but Jimmy was a soldier.  There was that Opie and Anthony, wow, Sirius XM sticker.  They don't give a fuck, man.  They really don't.  On John, on John, on John, on John Leno.  On John Stewart.  Yes, John Leno.  I was going to say John Leno because I got John Lennon on the brain.  John Leno.  Fuck.  But there's Jimmy.  He didn't have to fucking do that.  I know he did it for us.  That was for you guys, man.  Yeah, but you know what?  You could have, you could have like, you know, it could have just been an Opie and Anthony  wow sticker.  It would have been very easy to cut out the Sirius XM part. 
[00:48:30]  But there's Jimmy, a true soldier.  They see that as a weakness.  It's so fucking bizarre.  It's a bizarre interaction.  Don't get it.  Nope.  Anyway, let's move on.  What did you have?  You had like a secret surprise?  Well, yeah, we're going to get to that.  But you know, I mean, when we say we're going to do it right after the break, everyone knows  they got to wait.  You really don't mean it.  They got to wait at least another hour.  Because we were distracted by Star Magazine.  Right.  Well, they're filming the Sex and the City movie. 
[00:49:00]  The second one, I guess.  Did you see the first one, Ant?  Oh, Opie, I adored it.  It was so fucking.  Who's your favorite?  You couldn't drag me.  Who's your favorite?  Come on.  I know you like one of them.  If you had to, which Sex and the City broad would you do?  If I had.  Oh, this music makes my fucking dick shrivel.  If I had to.  What?  They're just a bunch of sassy broads trying to make it in New York City.  If I had to fuck one of these broads, it would be Kristen Davis. 
[00:49:30]  Hell fucking yeah.  Up top.  I know we don't touch, but let's make believe we're up top.  All right, we're up top.  Up top, all right.  It would be, she is the lesser of four fucking disgusting evils.  Let me take a look.  Let me see who I would do.  I would never do a redhead.  And by the way, she is complete dyke.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  But you got to make believe, because she's not.  In the Sex and the City world, she's all about the penis. 
[00:50:00]  What, do you think you'd have to worry about red hair?  That would be a big gray patch.  No, I don't like, I don't like the redhead.  No?  No, I know my hair is sort of red, too, but I don't like the redhead.  But there's different shades of red that are cool.  Ronald McDonald red?  No.  I don't have that, right?  Strawberry blondish girl?  Yeah, I got a little that, actually.  Very hot.  Sarah Jessica Parker?  Never.  I am looking at...  Kristen Davis.  I'll get to that.  Yeah, yeah.  Kristen Davis would have to be the one.  She's kind of the soccer mom, but that kept herself in relatively good shape kind of look. 
[00:50:30]  If you walked into a whorehouse and those four girls were at the bar and you got to pick...  Oh, shit.  Man, Kristen Davis would be taking all our mules.  Oh, she'd just be sitting there.  One after another.  These dried up old hags would be sitting on the bar stools waiting for anyone to fuck them.  And Kristen Davis would just have a fucking geyser coming out of her ears.  Yeah.  And you know what? 
[00:51:00]  That's not even saying much.  But they're filming Sex and the City, too.  Oh, they certainly are.  They're shutting down Manhattan for these broads.  And let me tell you something.  Yeah.  This sounds fantastic because apparently there's a portion of the film where they do a flashback scene.  Ooh.  I like flashbacks.  Or I don't know how long it lasts, but let me tell you something.  The girls.  Let's call them the girls.  Mm-hmm.  They don their best 80s attire.  What they wore back in the 80s. 
[00:51:30]  Now, the Cynthia Nixon bush eater, she had like kind of a boss lady look, much like Melanie  Griffith in Working Girl.  Okay.  She had that kind of look in the 80s.  So there she is.  Big picture of her.  Okay.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Walking down the street in kind of that skirt, the smart businesswoman look.  She's all business.  She's all business.  Yeah.  She doesn't take the cock.  No. 
[00:52:00]  Then we go to Sarah Jessica Parker, our favorite girl, Carrie from Sex and the City.  And she is just a wild girl because she is dressed like Madonna.  Early Madonna.  Early Madonna, the material girl, Opie, the material girl.  And there she is.  I love how they try to portray Sarah Jessica Parker as like the hot one out of those four.  Stop this.  That's like having like four lumps of shit in front of you. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  And you got to pick one as the tastiest one.  What's the tastiest lump of shit?  I would go with-  The one with a little sugar on it.  Dog shit, hell fucking no, man.  Human shit, fuck no.  Well-  Dude, when human shit pops out of those-  Jimmy, well-  My experience has been when it pops out of the water in the toilet.  You've had a different experience.  But man, when that shit isn't in the water, good God.  Oof.  It's getting really bad.  Good fucking God.  Thank God for the water toilets.  Sarah Jessica Parker has what appears to be that neck divot going on. 
[00:53:00]  Where I believe they removed her Adam's apple.  It left a divot.  She's got that old lady kind of-  All the ligaments kind of are all tight.  And it makes that hole in your neck like it had a trach.  And her cleavage, they're showing some cleavage because she's in her material girl Madonna outfit.  But I don't know what's going on there.  Anthony, be careful because I don't want Sarah Jessica Parker calling the show today. 
[00:53:30]  Yes, yes.  I remember when she called.  That would be a tragedy if she called our show again.  Very, very angry.  Wink, nudge, nudge.  So she's just a mess.  But you said something about her cleavage, too.  Yeah, her cleavage is-  You said that, right?  Okay.  Yeah, it's just, I don't know what's going on there.  I think she got a bad boob job, is my guess.  Bad boob job?  Because she never showed her boobs on Sex and the City, and I think the rest of the girls did.  I don't remember those big tits when she was on that series Square Pegs.  She was a little young.  Oh, maybe they hadn't grown yet. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, look at the face.  Dee Snider.  There's some Dee Snider going on there.  There's atrocious.  Anyway, and then we go to the wild one.  Uh-oh.  Opie, hold on.  We're talking about Samantha.  Kim Cattrall.  She plays wild Samantha, and let me tell you, she is the rocker chick back in the 80s.  Well, who else would be the rocker chick on those four?  A la Lita Ford.  She's looking very big, blonde hair. 
[00:54:30]  She's got the feather earring thing coming down, studded denim vest, a multicolored leopard top,  and snake skin pants that are just real tight to her fucking disastrous body, and red rocker boots like Sammy Hagar would wear.  And she's got a little Walkman on her hip on her 80s belt.  And boy, is she just doing the town, turning some heads, I would think. 
[00:55:00]  Anthony, by the way, people are writing in with their favorite shit.  Scott from Hoppog.  I vote for deer shit.  Probably most healthy with the berry diet.  Deer shit.  Now, you have to go with an animal that is a vegetarian.  Yeah.  You can't go with a meat-eating animal because meat shits, well, we don't even have to discuss it.  Animal, vegetarian animal shits, you could deal with it because it pretty much comes out as a mushed-up version of how it went in. 
[00:55:30]  Would you eat a pellet of shit right now from, like, a hamster or something?  I would if you would.  Let me think.  What does a hamster eat?  I don't know.  What do hamsters eat?  Lettuce?  You give them, like, lettuce and they go...  Danny, are you in?  They eat that, like, that feed stuff that you get at the petting zoo.  Yeah, so it looks like feed when it comes out.  Oh, pellets?  It goes in like pellets, comes out like pellets.  How much of a difference do you think it's going to make?  The animal's shitting.  Well, if he eats, like, a really nice diet, the shit will be fucking delicious. 
[00:56:00]  Dude, meat continues to rot.  That's the problem.  I don't want meat.  Anthony's sort of onto something.  Yeah, yeah, you've got to get vegetables in there.  Although, vegetarians have human shits.  What's that all about?  What is that about?  I don't understand why a vegetarian can have smelly human shit.  Maybe Dr. Steve can help us out.  That's a good idea.  Wake that dummy up.  Wait, he's got an observation about Samantha and what she looks like. 
[00:56:30]  Who's this?  Yeah, this is Roche from Wackback.  What's up, brother?  I assume you're looking at the pictures from What Would Tyler Durden Do?  I'm looking from Star Magazine, but it's probably the same pictures.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, those Samantha pictures, that's like Sandy Cain minus 20 years.  Dude, you are exactly right.  Wait, this is Sandy Cain.  You nailed it.  She looks like Sandy Cain. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And then we have Preppy Princess.  That's Kristen Davis.  She's the good girl.  She's the only one you kind of want to see skin on.  Charlotte.  And they never show skin.  And she is being lumped in, as far as the 80s go, sort of a Kate and Allie look from the show Kate and Allie.  Wearing a little sweater tied around the neck, lime green, little top, a skirt that goes down to her knees, very conservative. 
[00:57:30]  Some L.A. gear footwear, I believe.  And, yeah, she's doable.  You think she has a tight hiney hole?  No, it looks like she's got the secretary spread going.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, you could kind of see that there's something going on there.  Oh, boy.  But the audacity.  Look at fucking Sarah Jessica Parker's hand.  Danny has brilliantly brought it up and zoomed in on her hand. 
[00:58:00]  That's a corpse hand.  Dude, that is a fucking...  If you didn't know any better, you would go, that's a hand from a dead body.  That is a hand.  Yeah, that should be clutching rosary beads on its own lap in a wooden box.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what the fuck?  Oh, but she's still got it going on.  No, she doesn't.  There are four girls just trying to make it in the city.  Just trying to make it in the city.  And this...  Anyway, they can.  Here's my biggest problem with this. 
[00:58:30]  Look, everyone fucking gets old.  What are we in?  In a time machine?  Hyperbolic chamber?  Everyone gets old.  But please, don't try to present yourself in a movie as if you're still in the 80s in a flashback sequence.  Recast.  Do a fucking casting call.  They probably would have gotten a lot of publicity for trying to recast the younger versions of these girls.  Sure.  But these fucking self-centered, self-righteous, conceited fucking diva twats would never allow girls to play them that were hot. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  That would look like, you know...  Yeah.  Those girls from fucking...  The hills?  Like the hills.  Well, you made that point brilliantly.  Oh.  Unfortunately, it wasn't on the air, but I saw a picture of...  Who was it?  I forgot her name.  Stunning McStunning?  Yeah.  Some really hot girl.  Yeah.  And Ann goes, that is sex in the city right there. 
[00:59:30]  That's it, because the girl...  It's a picture of her.  She's a young girl trying to make it in the city any way she can, but she's a hot piece of ass.  She's in a really nice-looking dress on her, and she's walking through the city through, like, traffic, and she's got, like, that, ooh, look.  I'm like, oh.  Right.  Like, oh, there's so much going on here.  I'm young and in the city.  And it is exactly what they are trying to go for with Sex and the City.  Who owns the Sex and the City franchise?  It must be Sarah Jessica Parker and fucking Kim Cattrall, because... 
[01:00:00]  Why don't you kick these four to the curb and go, all right, look, the Sex and the City franchise is massive.  We've got to recast this with young girls.  Do a Star Trek.  Yes.  Just fucking reinvent it, cast new hot chicks, and have them just fucking continue where no man has gone before.  And here's something.  Have the Cougar in her 30s, not her 50s.  Exactly.  The Cougar, Samantha, is actually 53, 54 in real life. 
[01:00:30]  But if you cast them, recast them as young hot chicks and had them dress like Madonna and fucking, you know, Lita Ford and stuff like that, that would be more acceptable, I think.  Yeah.  To an audience, instead of looking at these hags trying to pull off that this is how they looked in the 80s.  I just don't get it.  I know it's for the women out there, but I just don't get it.  Yeah, it is for the women out there, believe me.  But there's things out there for other people, but you could at least wrap your arms around and go, okay, I understand. 
[01:01:00]  Oh.  What, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?  Jen and Gerard Butler, apparently?  It's for real?  Well, I didn't see that headline.  Could you save it for our gossips?  We're now doing gossip on our show.  Do tell, do tell.  Jennifer Aniston?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's 40, though.  It's all right.  She's really put together well.  She's put together well, and she's got the celebrity thing going, so you've got to kind of... 
[01:01:30]  I think she's the hottest 40-year-old out there.  There's a little...  Joel, man.  There's a little...  Nicole Richie, welcome baby sparrow.  Oh, my goodness.  What's going on in Hollywood?  Look at that, Jennifer Aniston.  That ass has held up.  See?  Yeah, it did.  That is very important.  Look at that.  And if she was in the Sex and the City movie, I think she's older than maybe one.  Yeah, probably.  And she looks way younger than all of them.  Maybe.  Right?  Not sure.  Anthony, we got the plot of the sequel to the Sex and the City movie. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, great.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob?  All right.  What's up, Rob?  Guys.  All hyperbaric.  Yeah, yeah.  TMZ leaked the plot of the new movie.  Apparently, the four of them get on a shuttle, and they launch up, and the shuttle explodes.  And then for the rest of the movie, they discuss what happened to the O-ring.  That was mine.  Wait a minute.  That was my synopsis.  That was Jimmy Norton.  Of the first movie. 
[01:02:30]  Funny as that.  That's not.  I love you, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  I don't remember that.  That's right.  What a horrible plot.  I know.  They just discuss the O-rings.  But they don't discuss it.  The prosecuting attorney does with members of NASA.  They're out of the picture.  Within the first three minutes, they're out of the picture.  I remember that.  I actually do know the plot of the second one, because I know an A.D. on the film.  Please tell me.  No, because he will get fired.  Really?  Yes. 
[01:03:00]  I will say it revolves around a barbershop quartet.  Oh.  Yes.  Interesting.  I've got to see it.  Yeah, Jennifer, look at that.  Let me see.  Nice.  That's a nice rump.  That's very nice.  Let's say hi to Larry King, Anthony.  Larry.  Hey, boys.  It's Keith and Tampa.  I'm here with Larry King.  Hang on.  All right.  I actually pretend to hand him the phone.  Okay.  What an asshole.  Good morning.  Hi, love.  Sarah Jessica Parker.  Why the wrong thing? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, can I have a new product, boys?  What is it?  Go fucking catch.  There you are.  Always nice to hear.  Always a pleasure.  Is this Sarah Jessica Parker checking in?  What?  This ain't good.  Sarah?  Hello?  Hi.  Hi, Sarah.  Hey, if you guys are going to plug the movie, you've got to get the name right.  They changed it for the sequel.  It's not Sex and the City.  It's Sex with the Seniors.  Oh.  I was scared for a minute.  It almost sounded like her.  Boo! 
[01:04:00]  Holy shit.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Enough about the Sex and the City broads.  God damn.  I guess we're just jealous, Anne.  Now I'm just thumbing through the magazine at young starlets that are up and coming.  I don't know.  It's from some Disney show.  No.  Let me see the picture again.  Yeah.  Will you stop ignoring Selena Gomez?  Get on the Selena Gomez train.  I'm on it.  Team Selena Gomez, Anne.  Yeah.  Which one would you?  Who's the one on the left there?  Demi Lovato? 
[01:04:30]  Selena Gomez.  Let's see.  The Disney cuties have been this close since they first met in 99 as seven-year-olds auditioning  for the kiddie show Barney and Friends.  All right.  Help me out.  99-7.  What are we looking at?  Yeah.  That's another 10 years.  They're 17.  All right.  Legal, legal beagle.  There you go.  Look at that, Anne.  While they have yet to fall for the same guy, I think I'll be like, you can have him because  I don't want to ruin our friendship, says Demi.  Then she'd be like, no, you can have him. 
[01:05:00]  And then we'd end up not liking him.  Shut up and get in the vault.  Get in the vault under my house.  Very nice.  I got the globe here, too, Anne.  Really?  They're way better.  Larry!  Good morning, boys.  Oh, Larry King.  Surprise.  How important was the menopause?  Feverfall, Tennessee.  You better boss go. 
[01:05:30]  You better.  Here, Anne.  This is the one.  Look at the globe.  Oh.  Because they get a little crazier.  They do get crazier.  The last one had one of the last pictures that you'll see of Jack Klugman before his dad.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was bad.  Oh, and for Jimmy, this is what Jack Black dressed as for the VMAs.  Oh, yeah.  Look.  Look.  You never know what you're going to get with that nut.  Let me see.  How funny is that?  He has fake muscles.  Oh, God.  He's good.  And he really played it up like he was on the roids and stuff and working out real hard. 
[01:06:00]  People must have cracked up.  It was very funny, Jimmy.  Very funny.  Well, it's for a video game.  Well, he, like, wrote and starred in this video game, and that's what he was plugging during  the VMAs.  That's why he's all dressed up and looking ridiculous.  Oh, I understand why he's dressed up and looks ridiculous, but his material was horrendous  because he was trying to get jokes out.  Oh, God.  You never know what you're going to get with that nut.  I'm telling you.  He is crazy.  He's crazy is what he is.  Give me that back. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, here.  Oh.  We're doing our gossip set.  Oh, my God.  Garth Brooks has to lose 50 pounds.  What's going to happen if he doesn't?  Life-saving diet.  Really?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  This is just...  What's George Clooney up to?  Comes off as the perfect gentleman as he kisses the delicate digits of his current gal pal  to a tuted Italian model, Elisabetta Canalis, at the Venice Film Festival.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Anthony?  Boy, that Clooney. 
[01:07:00]  Jesus.  He can fucking get some chicks.  Am I saying something no one knows?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You are.  Really?  Why?  Is there other...  Hold it.  Are there rumors?  Mm-hmm.  Are there rumors?  Mm-hmm.  Are there rumors?  Mm-hmm.  Are there rumors?  Mm-hmm.  Really?  You never heard that?  No!  Let's just put it...  Oh, God.  Nancy Reagan.  What?  Oh, Ronnie.  You're going to have company soon.  Let me see this. 
[01:07:30]  Look at Nancy Reagan.  Oh, no.  She's pretty much wearing a hospital gown and...  At all times.  At all times now.  And she has a big walker with the wheels on the front.  She's got Freddie Lakers glasses on.  Yeah.  What do you expect her to be doing?  Fucking walking out of a JV concert?  JV concert?  I stink.  Boo!  JV!  Oh, Jimmy.  I was so good, too.  Anthony...  I wouldn't expect her to be coming out of a Jay-Z concert either, though. 
[01:08:00]  Boo!  Anthony, Ellen DeGeneres is the new judge on American Idol.  Yeah.  And it seems like Simon's not happy about it.  Still hasn't really talked to her.  No?  And...  It's crazy.  Ready for this?  Here's the quote in My Rag magazine.  Unlike Paula, Ellen is not afraid to get in Simon's face.  Ooh.  Well.  Ooh.  I can't wait to see that.  Those things are heating up.  She just doesn't want Simon's face inside her. 
[01:08:30]  But she dances all over the place.  Oh, she's going to do the dancing.  Oh, when they're singing, she's probably going to get up and the whole audience is going  to get up and dance.  And then the roof caves in and everyone dies.  I don't think that will happen.  No.  Oh, and this just...  I like to knock other NBC employees.  Oh, whoops.  I told Anthony...  Sorry, it's the new Jimmy.  Jimmy the diplomat.  Told Anthony this morning, breaking news, and it's in My Rag magazine as well, Burt Reynolds. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  We all remember Burt Reynolds, right?  Of course we do.  He's in rehab for booze and pills.  What?  And I told Anthony this morning, isn't he too old to be in rehab?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't you get to a point where why would you go into rehab?  It's just your life.  He's 73.  You just keep fucking drinking or doing what you want to do?  Thanks, Danny.  Oh, wow.  Lucky us.  Oh, God. 
[01:09:30]  Look at Burt Reynolds' hiney.  He looked good back then.  I mean, you know, it's easy to laugh at a man.  How the fuck did you find that?  He's too old for rehab, right?  He also had the centerfold in...  Was it Cosmo?  I think it was Cosmo.  Was it...  I'm not sure.  Was it Playgirl?  Was it a football or something covering up his quark?  Oh, God.  Hairy mess.  It's old man. 
[01:10:00]  No twink there.  No.  The ups and downs of Grace's...  I don't care about that.  I like gossip.  Give me some good stuff.  There's nothing good.  Ali turned into dazed cash cow.  Grueling farewell tours.  Boxing legend fights Parkinson's.  That sucks.  They're just leading him around and making money off of him wherever he goes.  He's like a shaky ATM.  Oh, Pink.  She's crazy.  What is she doing? 
[01:10:30]  You never know with her.  She's just wearing a bunch of clothes.  Well, not much clothes.  She's wearing a dress and you can see her tats.  Yeah.  She's got like...  Can we go to Pink's Twitter?  Because she's always saying something crazy on her Twitter.  It's insane.  Let's see what she's talking about today.  This Pink.  You don't want to get on her bad side.  I'm telling you.  Heck no.  Lindsay Lohan has a Just Say No to Drugs shirt on.  How ironic is that?  Come on.  It's so ironic.  Anything worth talking about here? 
[01:11:00]  She broke her collarbone.  She broke her collarbone?  Well, she...  Come on.  She separated it.  Really?  Rather.  All right.  We're going to take a break, Ant.  Oh, no, but...  Are you done with the gossip segment?  I think it went well.  Oh.  Wow.  Fucking David Schwimmer.  Just five years after Friends went off the air, you could barely recognize him.  New hairstyle and 20 extra pounds.  Let me see.  Get out of here.  Yes.  What does he look like? 
[01:11:30]  Holy shit.  Let me see with the 20 pounds.  That's hard to imagine.  Yes.  Look.  See?  Whoa.  Oh, God.  What did he do?  Ross, what have you done to yourself?  Is that his name on Friends?  Of course.  Yeah.  Ross Geller.  Scotty-O in Cleveland.  Oh, no, because it's printed here, so shut up.  Scotty-O.  What's up there, boys?  You're late on all this section of the city gossip.  I heard it all last night on The Man Hole.  Oh, can we play that promo again going into break?  Got to hear The Man Hole.  Thank you, sir.  What's that?  A picture of a boy's life from a boy's life with De Niro and DiCaprio. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  De Niro was chubby in that movie?  I don't know.  He looks chubby.  I think he's just smiling.  Can I say this, though?  Would I get my friend in trouble?  What the plot of Sex and the City is?  The second movie?  Yes.  Please.  Yes.  It revolves.  For some reason, they don't even explain it, but it doesn't take place in modern times.  It takes place in the 1800s, and it starts off with, they're in a stagecoach, and they're 
[01:12:30]  having some banter, and then they're robbed by banditos.  Banditos?  All four of them are shot in the face and left for dead behind a shrub.  And then the banditos go around spending their money.  That's what the entire film is, buying things.  Now that I might go see.  I know.  It sounds like a good movie.  But they don't buy fun things.  They just buy little household knickknacks.  Really?  Yeah.  Not things banditos would have bought.  That's the surprising part of the movie.  Oh, the twist.  Yeah.  Boy, are you in Dutch now when they find out you gave away the plot? 
[01:13:00]  People would be so mad if they died in the first three minutes of the film.  God, would that be great?  We pitched that.  And then bring in new broads.  We pitched that at the beginning, from the last movie we pitched it.  And now, it would be nice if they had done it this movie.  I like the way Ant is nicely trying to tell me, you did that already.  He's not wrong.  No, I'm saying they should have done it the first movie.  And now that they didn't, they should do it now.  I want to see Queen Latifah in this one.  I don't know about you.  I hope she's sassy. 
[01:13:30]  Imagine that if it was a jail movie and Queen Latifah strap-on fucked all four of them in  the ass and face.  And that was the whole movie.  Just rubbing their faces on her vag as they cry.  That's the tagline for the movie.  Wash my pussy with your face.  I'm going to go to break.  Yes.  I'm going to say what we're doing next.  So these fuckers stay around. 
[01:14:00]  All right.  We talked about this.  Is this your surprise?  Yeah.  We talked about this and just forgot about it.  But Travis did not forget about this idea we had.  Travis never forgets.  After the break, a whole CD of callers bombing on the Opie and Anthony show.  Caller bombs!  That's right, fuckers.  Ah, good.  It's time for a little retribution, you shits.  Oh, you have a good laugh when we bomb.  Well, after the break, a whole CD of callers bombing on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, I want to see a few names pop up here going, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh boy, I know I had one.  Yeah.  Well, listen up.  Well, we got ten of them.  Ten!  We got ten of them.  And we will do it right after the break.  Stay there.  Anthony, it's a very sad morning.  2009, the year of the celebrity death continues.  Yeah.  We lost two biggies overnight.  Henry Gibson from Laugh-In fame has passed at the age of 73. 
[01:15:00]  And again, you might not remember him, but...  What was his big line on Laugh-In?  Very interesting, but stupid.  He would dress like the German, uh, you know, soldier and say, very interesting.  And there was also the old guy that would, um, harass, uh...  Ruth Buzzy?  Ruth Buzzy on the park bench.  Right.  And he would, um, yeah, there he is.  Sorry.  And he would, uh, pedal the tricycle.  Yeah.  And then just fall over. 
[01:15:30]  Bam-dee-bam-dee-bam-dee-bam.  Wah!  And then he'd fall over sideways.  And I guess he was in Boston Legal?  The William Shatner, uh, show.  He had some small...  I didn't see Boston Legal.  I heard that was a really good show to watch, too.  And was he in, um, Magnolia or not?  Or it's a different guy?  Um, let me see what's-her-name dancing there.  Sorry.  Goldie Hawn?  Goldie Hawn was the little fucking go-go girl chick.  Jesus, hey, Christ.  Yeah.  That's where Kate Hudson got her boobs from, huh?  Yep. 
[01:16:00]  None boobs.  I didn't know Goldie didn't have any boobs, either.  None breasts.  So runs in the family.  And then we also, uh, lost, and I hope Travis has a song cued up for the next one.  We lost Mary.  Of course he's got a cued up.  What is this?  From Peter, Paul, and Mary.  Oh, boy.  I've had so much of the songs on my iPod for so long.  Why are the phones lit?  Tick dragon, lit by the sea. 
[01:16:30]  Could you totally do this one in honor of the passing of Mary?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And all things strings and sling back and all the fancy stuff.  Oh, toodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly do doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly doodly do 
[01:17:00]  Dude, who needs Mary?  Fuck her.  Was this a drug song?  A lot of discussion if this was a drug song or not.  I don't.  By the way, the phones are lit because these fuckers don't let anything get past them. 
[01:17:30]  Uh-oh, what happened?  They're saying you're talking about Artie Johnson on Laugh-In.  Yeah.  Henry Gibson was a different dude.  Yes.  Oh, Artie Johnson.  Henry Gibson was the guy that said, a poem by Henry Gibson.  Okay.  Can I get a picture of Henry Gibson?  Oops.  I met Artie Johnson, too.  I should have known that.  No, you didn't.  How many laughing lies can you tell?  Every day, it's a different one. 
[01:18:00]  I'm sorry.  I fucked up.  Oh, my God.  I should have known that.  Where did you meet Artie Johnson?  When did this fucking happen?  Same time I met Groucho.  It was all one same event.  For real?  Yeah, same dream.  Yeah.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Same event as Groucho Marx.  What was the event?  It was called the Day at the Races.  It was called the Day at the Races, and it was quarter horse racing out in California.  And I went.  It was like amateurs racing horses.  Did he try to touch your penis? 
[01:18:30]  And my father was racing his horse.  All right.  And no, no, he never tried to touch my penis.  Never.  Why would he?  Just wondering.  And then it was Artie Johnson, not Henry Gibson, that came up to me.  And I was talking to him as a little child.  Mm-hmm.  Which was creepy.  But I knew him from, you know, laughing.  From laughing.  A big star for the time.  Apparently, I didn't remember him well enough because I had him written off as dead.  Was Henry Gibson in, what was the name of the Tom Cruise movie?  Magnolia?  With the raining frogs? 
[01:19:00]  What the fuck was the name of that?  No, it was Magnolia with William Macy.  It was good.  Yeah, it was a good movie.  Wasn't he the guy in the bar?  I don't remember.  Who wanted the bartender?  Any movie buffs out there?  Was he in Magnolia?  Henry Gibson?  I have no idea.  Yeah.  Mm.  Yeah.  We've reached an impasse.  Well, because I want to know, that's all.  I have no idea.  So, whatever.  Peter, Paul, and Mary and Henry Gibson.  And join Patrick Swayze. 
[01:19:30]  Wow.  He was in Magnolia?  Right on.  Okay.  I guess God needed an actor that Anthony thought was someone else.  Yeah.  A couple other deaths.  A Boston sports announcer, legendary.  Who the fuck tweeted me with that shit yesterday?  What?  Legendary Boston sports announcer died.  Was it the Bruins guy?  I don't know.  And then the NCAA guy who fired Bobby Knight also passed.  Really? 
[01:20:00]  He was only like 67.  I think the pancreatic got him.  Wow.  I think.  That's going around.  It's like the fucking swine flu.  Yeah, you don't want to catch the pancreatic.  Jesus, no.  That's a bad one.  Henry Gibson was the head of the Nazis and the Blues Brothers, Anthony.  Do you remember that?  I certainly do.  I don't remember that Blues Brothers movie anymore.  Yeah.  I saw a part of it recently, and I do remember it.  The movie's really long.  Yeah, it is.  A lot of fucking car chases, too.  Long movie.  A lot of.  A long.  Well, the last car chase is just gigantic. 
[01:20:30]  That's pretty much the car chase of all time.  Right.  And too much fucking blues.  Well, it's the Blues Brothers.  Too much blues and soul music for my liking.  I'm not into the musical.  I like the music in that movie.  Yeah, me too.  For real?  Some of it.  The Blues Brothers?  Yeah.  But then the remake.  I don't want to hear.  Ha-da-ha-da-ha-da-ha.  I get it.  That was the Mooch.  I don't want Minnie the Mooch.  That was Cab Calloway.  Cab Calloway.  It wasn't Minnie the Mooch.  That's the song thing.  Yeah.  But it was. 
[01:21:00]  Cab Calloway.  Ha-da-ha-da-ha-da-ha.  Wasn't really into that.  Oh, also, Jimmy's a big M.  Are you into M.A.S.H. still?  I love M.A.S.H., yeah.  37 years ago today, I think.  Gary.  Yeah.  Hi, Gary.  Hi.  I just want to let you know, I was watching TV Land last night, and they were doing a whole  marathon special because Larry Gelbarch, one of the producers or creators of M.A.S.H.  died.  Oh, did he die?  Yeah.  All right.  I think Jonathan knew him, my manager. 
[01:21:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I have something else for Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Yesterday, when you were talking about the bus ride, you were mentioning that the kids  on the bus were, I don't know, in chorus doing something.  Back where I come from, they used to call that going natural.  If you watch these Zulu warriors jumping up and down and shaking their hands and fists  in the air, it's very similar to that.  Interesting.  Thank you for the little lesson on history and racism.  I was going to say, thank you for the racism this morning. 
[01:22:00]  All right.  Take care.  We need a little sip of racism every morning.  Well, I was sitting home yesterday.  No, you weren't.  After work.  Yes, I was.  Yes, I was.  Prove it.  I really can't.  I was completely alone.  But I was sitting home alone and we'll knock on the door.  Was it Joe Pesci?  No.  Why would it be?  Home alone because Joe.  Oh, no, no.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Bam. 
[01:22:30]  And it was two old ladies at the door.  Did you fork them?  So I fucking plowed them, dude.  And they were selling.  They were both 25?  Asshole.  They were selling Girl Scout cookies.  All right.  So they're a little old.  What do you want from them?  No, they were legitimate old ladies.  Yeah.  What the fuck were they selling?  Yeah, it was like, so I opened the door and I'm like, ah, I'm standing there. 
[01:23:00]  I won't let them in.  But they're getting closer to the door and kind of looking like they wanted me to go, oh, why don't you come in?  So I'm just standing kind of blocking the door and leaning on the door.  And the real old one, there was a real old one and then an old one.  The real old one is like.  Do you know, don't, wouldn't you agree that in this day and age,  there's so much strife and pain in the world and stuff.  So instantly I'm like, all right, Jesus, they're selling fucking God. 
[01:23:30]  They're selling Jesus and God and religion and everything.  And they were.  And it's like, wouldn't it be great if there was a world where everybody got along?  That is the paradise that God wants for us.  And then she keeps going, talking about how the world has a user's manual, just like everything else.  And then she knocks on my house and she's like, when you build a house, you need a blueprint for that house.  She's like, the world has a blueprint. 
[01:24:00]  And she's babbling.  I'm looking into her fucking like soulless, dead old eyes.  And just so she hands me some literature.  And I'm just like, oh, that would be amazing.  And she opens up a page in this book and there's a cartoony illustration of a big open field with a waterfall.  Oh, and people, drawings of people of all races, just like a big picnic.  Looks like a big picnic.  She goes, this is the type of world we can have if we all accept the user's manual for the world, which is God. 
[01:24:30]  God, God, she goes, would you just read this and then maybe we can stop back sometime and discuss what you've read?  And I'm like, you know, yeah, that sounds good because I am fucking setting up a camera.  All right.  Because I got my security cameras going in very soon.  As a matter of fact, today.  Thank fucking God you invited them back.  So I figure if they come back, I'm rolling fucking tape. 
[01:25:00]  Bring them into the compound.  Oh, believe me, I'm going to come in.  And I am going to be armed like a motherfucking mercenary, drinking beer.  Make sure you have a boner.  I'll have porno on the fucking big screen.  Sweatpants and a boner, too.  No, I got to wear military stuff.  Yeah.  Okay.  Garb.  Garb, as they say.  No, military stuff up top, fucking sweatpants down below.  Camo sweatpants.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And a boner.  You got camo sweatpants?  No, I kind of got like camo loose pants that are kind of nice to just wander around the house in. 
[01:25:30]  Okay.  Just in case I got to hide behind a fucking plant.  What the hell goes on in your mind?  Oh, it's crazy.  So all that inspiration, though, that they gave me and the book, which I put right on my kitchen table, just flopped it down and stuff, and the whole imagery of all the races living together, the picture.  All it made me do was remember, I haven't visited a certain website in quite a while. 
[01:26:00]  So you went there?  So I went right there and started watching videos about the Crips that are on YouTube.  Wow.  You don't want to get on their bad side.  Hardcore motherfuckers.  But they are completely different than anything else that is known on the face of the world.  They are just about money, drugs, and killing people.  It's fantastic.  I wouldn't say that's different than a lot of other organizations.  It's pretty similar.  True, true. 
[01:26:30]  But the whole thing, like that, I couldn't understand half of what they were even talking about.  It was fantastic, though.  If you get a chance, I highly recommend it.  It's, yeah, Compton Crips Part 1.  Fuck no.  Compton Crips.  Just fucking look at Compton Crips, and it is the shit, yo.  I don't want to.  For shizzle.  I don't want to know.  You know what's happening also?  Look at these fucking hardcore motherfuckers.  Every other word is nigga, too.  Every other word.  We're not allowed to say it, though.  It's just like, yo, yo, nigga, yo. 
[01:27:00]  It's unbelievable.  And they're just, look at this guy.  He's got no leg.  His leg was shot off.  What year is this done?  Very recently.  Yeah, this one's pretty recently.  Why are they showing their faces on YouTube videos?  They love showing the money.  They love pulling out hundreds and just fanning it out and showing their guns and shit.  Spooktown Crips.  This is the Spooktown Crips.  And then there's A Street, yo, and they're throwing up gang signs and there are tats and everything.  It's a fascinating look into some hardcore shit. 
[01:27:30]  I don't know how they get their fingers.  That's how I would get killed.  My fingers wouldn't do the right thing.  I don't know how they get their fingers to do those symbols.  Oh, if your hand cramps in Compton, you're getting shot.  You're like, ow, what happened?  Oh, yeah, I threw up the wrong gang sign.  It's really cool, though.  Compton Crips.  You know what else is going on?  There seems to be this thing that's going on in Compton and in Oakland where if you have a car and you're driving through a certain neighborhood and you get stopped at a light,  they will jump on your fucking car and just keep jumping up and down on the hood, smashing your windshield, punch the windows, drag you out, kick the shit out of you, pull your doors off. 
[01:28:00]  It's just a gang of fucking roving maniacs completely ripping apart a vehicle.  Why would you stay there while they're doing that?  Exactly.  When I was saying watching it, I'm thinking, why the fuck would anybody stay there?  Hit the gas.  He's like, yo, man, yo.  Because this girl is a prostitute. 
[01:28:30]  You're a prostitute?  Uh, yeah.  It's just a great thing.  Why can't they control it?  It's called Compton Crips.  There's six parts or something like that.  Why can't they control it?  The cops were driving right the fuck by it.  They're like, fuck this.  Apparently, also, they said that in Compton and in their hood, yo, it's all sheriff's department now.  They don't get LAPD in there anymore.  And I believe it's because the LAPD has such a bad reputation from some people that they're just afraid of getting caught up in the LAPD black thing. 
[01:29:00]  They don't want anything happening like the Rodney King situation, rioting.  There's such animosity between the LAPD and the Compton black community.  So what they do is they send in the sheriffs.  And these guys love it.  All the gang members are going, yeah, we scared them out.  We're scared out the fucking LAPD.  It's all pussy sheriffs now, motherfucker.  Yo, my nigga.  They're all just fucking. 
[01:29:30]  It was one of the most hardcore depictions of fucking gangs that I've ever watched.  Would that face scare you?  Dude, I had just watching this.  You had nightmares?  I had my .40 caliber by my side just watching this.  Imagine that face.  It was fun.  Imagine that face looking over you on the street.  Jesus, hell no.  This guy was saying, I don't wear.  He goes, I don't wear no rag on my face, motherfucker.  I don't wear no rag.  You know who this is.  Come get me, motherfucker.  Oh, hard fucking core.  I think the guy, one of the leaders or one of the founders of the Crips, I think got the death penalty for some brutal murder. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, that was that fucking big guy.  Big dude, man.  Tuki or.  Tuki.  Stanley Tuki.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, it's an actor.  Big motherfucker.  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  Stanley Tucci was put to death.  No, what's his name though?  It's.  It was Tuki.  He's a big fucking giant biceps and shit.  They said they used to walk.  They would see people and he would just say, go knock that guy out.  And they would just walk up to people and just fucking knock him out in the street.  Yeah.  Just fucking wail people in the face. 
[01:30:30]  Man.  And these guys are all about like hoes, the money, yo.  I got to make my chips, my chips, yo.  I got my, the guy's like, I got my money on my mind and my hand on my nine.  And, and throughout this whole thing, there's some, they do some rapping and I swear the word  Glock comes up every three seconds.  That's why I hate fucking Glocks, by the way.  That is really not a very pleasant neighborhood to be in.  Holy shit.  And this is done today's time.  Why would you be in that neighborhood? 
[01:31:00]  They said, this is during the daytime where they might even give you a pass every so  often, but at night you're fucking dead.  And it's all about fucking shooting people now and, and fucking, uh, uh, they don't give  a shit.  They said, you walking down the street with your kids, whatever, we don't give a shit.  We got a beef with you motherfucker.  You're dead.  And these two just got out of school and, uh, they're, uh, they're, uh, baby G's.  They're BG's.  Anthony, do they have permits for all those guns? 
[01:31:30]  Uh, I don't think they are licensed to carry that firearm.  Uh, oh, that could be a problem.  That's going to be a problem.  If they get caught, they're going to get, uh, an unlicensed firearm, uh, citation, I believe.  Uh, Compton Cripps.  It's great.  Six parts on, um, on YouTube.  I would love to see that.  Yeah, it's really good.  Check it out.  I highly recommend it.  Now, I'm not playing the house liberal, but I will say, if you grow up in a neighborhood  where that is that fucking violent and that awful, you got to join a gang. 
[01:32:00]  It's like, what are you going to do?  You probably, maybe, maybe you could go solo, but if like, if you join a gang, it's fucking  safety.  You know what the thing is though?  And if you watch this, you'll see the younger people are brought into the gangs by their  older relatives, their brothers, their fathers, shit like this guy's selling a safe.  He's just on the corner going, yo, buy this safe.  He goes, it's a cost of 135.  I sell it for 75.  I'll be here all day, all day.  He's got his big fucking Tupac shirt on and shit, but the families bring them in like 
[01:32:30]  brothers and fathers, things like that.  Uncles, if only there was this, I don't know, maybe I'm naive, take all this energy that  goes into this because there was one drug dealer going, yeah, I'm out here all day, sunrise  to sunset and he's selling dope.  Like that's, that's a fucking job time.  You know, it's yeah, but you make a little more.  Exactly.  But you got to go through that.  You can't, I can make a little more by going into a bank and saying, give me all your fucking 
[01:33:00]  money too.  But, uh, well, probably not as more than I make here.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'm so wealthy.  Holy shit.  Okay.  Okay.  No, uh, but these guys, there, there is a hypocrisy in some of these people because they genuinely  say, look, I don't want this life.  I'd like to, you know, have a different life, but then they're, they're the cause of the problem.  They're fucking killing people there.  Look, they love fanning out the hundreds, yo. 
[01:33:30]  Well, that's, I mean, it's a tough spot to be in.  You can't get a real job when you can make a shitload of money, selling some drugs.  So what is the solution?  I don't know what the solution is, but I kind of understand why they would do this.  Dude, the cops roll through these areas and they show it.  They don't fucking stop.  They don't do shit anymore.  Go shoot the cops.  I wouldn't stop.  Yeah, they'll fucking shoot at cops.  And they, and they know that.  So they know that there's not as much of a risk as there was maybe, I don't know, whatever,  10 years ago.  They do it with impunity.  Why would you get a dumb, stupid job like we all had?  They kill, uh, with impunity. 
[01:34:00]  They, they sell, uh, dope on the streets.  Look at these motherfuckers.  Imagine, dude, can you even understand this culture?  Could you even understand being in the middle, being dropped in the middle of this and just  going, oh my God, I'd rather be in Baghdad.  It reminds me of a group of, uh, it's like when you see like supremacist meetings, it's  like the same.  No, no, no.  I was thinking that too.  I'll, I'll let you finish.  Go ahead.  It's the same.  It's a different way of communicating, but it's the same completely, uh, separate from 
[01:34:30]  my life way of being.  Like, I, I mean, I would obviously fit it with the white people better because I could  maybe talk my way out of it, but it's like, it's, it's the same fucking group mentality.  It's like, they don't, here's what the difference is.  The white supremacist groups don't have the impunity to ravage, uh, the, their community  the way that gangbangers do, uh, Bloods and Crips in, in, in South Central.  They own the fucking place and their numbers far outweigh the numbers of white supremacists. 
[01:35:00]  White supremacists don't have this unity that transcends a lot of borders.  It's a few nut jobs here and there preaching that, you know, black people need to do this.  Jews need to do this, but whatever.  This is a genuine working culture that is ingrained into South Central Compton.  Uh, it, it, it runs the place.  I see a business opportunity for us though. 
[01:35:30]  Oh yeah?  Absolutely.  You see all the money.  Yeah.  We could get some of that money.  How are we going to do that, Opie?  I want to open up a gap store because I think they need a gap.  I think the Utes need some clothes.  They got the money.  Me and you will open up a gap store.  South Central.  I would help them rob you.  I would help them.  Why?  A nice gap store?  What other business could, could we get going in South Central?  Oh, because the money's there and we, Starbucks, maybe we open up a Starbucks, open up a Starbucks  on the corner.  That would be nice.  How about, how about punching bags with different colored wigs from white people? 
[01:36:00]  Like you get a blonde wig or a brunette long wig and they can knock their shit out of it.  Jimmy, you don't understand business.  I'm, I'm thinking there's a very good opportunity here.  You think they're really looking Fitch because they have all that money, but what do they got  to buy with it?  So you and I, we go in there and we get a business going.  We start opening up retail outlets of places that you might see in the mall.  A little Abercrombie and Fitch.  Yeah, Abercrombie and Fitch.  Maybe an Orange Julius.  Forever 21.  Forever 21 would be good. 
[01:36:30]  I think a Spencer's would be fun too.  They might like glow in the dark posters.  Yeah, some gag gifts.  Yeah, gag gifts.  Things like that.  All right.  Good idea.  Get that rolling.  It was one of the most frightening documentaries I've ever watched in my life.  I got to check it out.  Yeah, it's good.  Six parts.  Compton Crips.  On YouTube.  Yeah.  All right, Anthony, a quickie, because we got to get to the callers bombing on the Opie  and Anthony show.  But first, Ernie Anastas here in New York.  It's a quickie.  Yeah.  He had a bit of a slip up as he was doing some reading the other day on the news. 
[01:37:00]  Drop C bomb.  On Fox 5 Sky Guardian and then check that Saturday to make your weekend plans.  Takes a tough man to make a tender forecast, Nick.  I guess that's me.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Okay, I'll do that.  All right, when we continue.  Keep fucking that chicken?  All right, look.  What did he mean to say?  I hear the video.  Yeah, that's chicken's good.  I hear the video is really good because I think it's Rosanna Scotto or whatever.  Her eyes just get really big. 
[01:37:30]  Like, what the hell did you just say?  Yeah, that's good.  How is that not an FCC findable find, though?  Findable find.  Keep fucking that chicken, yo.  I think they're saying he said keep plucking that chicken.  That was fucking.  You can hear it.  Let's hear it again.  Let's hear it again.  Fox 5 Sky Guardian and then check that Saturday to make your weekend plans.  Takes a tough man to make a tender forecast, Nick.  I guess that's me.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Okay, I'll do that.  All right, when we continue.  It wasn't Rosanna Scotto, but the other.  That wasn't plucking.  No.  It was fucking. 
[01:38:00]  That was, you heard, you heard that.  That was advice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Keep fucking that chicken.  What did he even mean by it, though?  Okay, Ernie.  Yeah, he just goes, okay, I will.  Here's the weather.  Oh, it's going to be getting a little colder here in the metropolitan.  Yeah, that's good.  Hold the chicken for me.  Hold it in front of the green screen.  I'll fuck it and use its head as a pointer.  There's a high pressure system coming.  Oh.  Yeah.  Ah, scoot.  Oh. 
[01:38:30]  Fucking crazy Nazi fucking a chicken.  Poor chicken.  There it goes.  Uh, Ant, ever heard of Newark or Brooklyn?  I don't know what that means.  They're bad, but they're not as bad as Compton.  Yeah, yeah.  There's bad areas everywhere.  I understand.  We understand that.  Brownsville, even, is not as bad as Compton.  There's Bloods and Crips everywhere, but not in the numbers and with the, uh, just freedom  to really wreak havoc that they have in these neighborhoods.  Because the drive-bys in New York are not going to be what they are, just because the  way New York structurally is built. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, true.  You're going to drive by and blast people and go four blocks into traffic.  It's like, it's a different animal in New York.  You can't just do that.  Yeah, that's true.  You know, meh, meh.  You're fucking stuck in a life.  Oh, shit, yo.  Speaking of slipping up, uh, anyone know this?  Cut slipping!  This Chris Collinsworth.  Yes.  Who?  What?  Does a little NFL action.  He's, uh, he's terrific.  And he played.  He was a very good receiver.  Well, back in, I think, 84, he said something, and, uh, now they're, uh, they're making his 
[01:39:30]  life hell.  25 years later.  Yeah, because it's surfaced.  And now he's got to apologize for something that he, he said 20, I think it's 25 years  ago.  Now, this is the world we now live on.  Says nothing to do.  I'll live in.  Nothing to do with the amazing Yankee win last night?  Okay.  Just checking.  Boo!  What did I tell you?  What?  Football started.  Baseball is officially over.  Everyone knows that.  You're insane.  Everyone knows that.  You're fucking undefeated.  Jets 1-0.  You're undefeated Jets.  That's right.  Mean nothing to me right now, as long as the Yankees are still playing. 
[01:40:00]  So, sorry.  What'd he say?  Is it audio or a video?  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  Chris Collinsworth from, I think, 1984.  Chris, why do you think those girls really like you?  I think probably because of the money, you know?  And I'm not going to deny it.  I walk around with $100 bills hanging out of my pockets, usually, and, uh, try and give  it my best shot because before I ever made any money, it was pretty much, uh, big nothings  bill.  I like girls that aren't too bright because you can trick them a little bit. 
[01:40:30]  The punk rockers all love me.  That's, those are my big girls.  And, uh, high school girls love me.  14 to 18.  I'm a big star with them.  As soon as they, you know, as soon as they matured, after about 18 years old, they start  figuring out that, wait a minute, I know there's better than that out there, you know?  Holy shit.  Where'd they put the microphone in my house?  I'm outraged.  My phone, my phone's being bugged.  Except with you, 14 is the second age.  That's the topper.  Yeah, there you go.  He's got to apologize for that now. 
[01:41:00]  He's just trying to be funny.  It's fucking, you know, 25 years ago.  I hope he's a belligerent bad look.  I was trying to be funny.  I was, whatever.  He's got to fuck off.  Yeah.  That statement was made how long ago?  25 years ago.  25 years ago?  And, and he's catching shit for it?  Yep.  Stop it.  Because he's on the network, eh?  You know?  Give me a break.  Wholesome stuff.  Give me a goddamn break.  Oh.  Should we clear the field so we can do the caller's bombing?  Yes.  Clear the field.  Some men are going to do some drinking.  Some bombing. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, I want to hear this.  I want to finally get back at the listener.  Getting back to Henry Gibson.  Yeah.  He was the priest in Wedding Crashers.  Mm-hmm.  There was another thing he did that was kind of important.  Nah.  What is?  Yes, Danny.  He was the senior Klopek from the Tom Hanks classic, The Birbs.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Oh, I know what it was because you said that.  You guys don't like that movie?  I hated The Birbs.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Is that one of the worst movies ever? 
[01:42:00]  No.  No.  He was in The Birds.  What?  Hitchcock's?  He was in The Birds.  I don't remember him being in The Birds.  Well, I mean, how would you remember that?  I've seen the movie.  Well, he was a youngster then.  He liked The Birds.  What do you play in The Birds?  When she gets her eyes plucked out, that was fucking scary shit.  That was very frightening.  Frightening.  Does that movie hold up?  A little child.  Well, as much as Hitchcock movies do, you know, they're old. 
[01:42:30]  Mm-hmm.  So you get that weird acting.  Hello.  Wow, there's birds.  What are we going to do?  What was with the acting back then?  Stunk.  Oh, my God.  Because they did that on a stage.  Yes, yes.  Stage actors.  Stage actors.  And all of a sudden there's cameras, but they're still doing this.  Right.  It doesn't matter what he was in The Birds.  Fuck him.  He's gone.  More useless info.  Arrivederci.  We'll do the caller's bombing next.  Opie and Anthony.  We got Joel McHale calling us in a few minutes from Talk Soup. 
[01:43:00]  Well, it's just called The Soup now.  Oh, really?  It's just called The Soup.  I like The Soup.  The Soup is good.  It's fun.  I got to tell you, I like Joel McHale a lot.  Yeah.  I'm actually a fan of his, but the problem is I don't like when he calls our show.  Oh, shit.  Really?  No, for real.  For real?  And he's in New York, and we're like, why don't you stop him by?  Yeah.  Because when he stops by, he's more involved.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Call-ins are not the easiest thing.  Yeah.  Some people, it's fine. 
[01:43:30]  Jay Moore does a good phoner.  Bill Burr does a good phoner.  Yes.  Rich Voss doesn't.  Well, some of them other guys do good phoner.  Patrice does a very good phoner.  And we like Rich Voss on the show, so don't start that shit.  But I mean, he's better in studio.  Patrice is really good on the phone.  Who else is really good on the phone?  I stink on the phone.  That's why I don't call in.  Where you get excited, like, oh, fuck, all right, cool.  Colin Quinn.  On the phone?  Yeah, Colin Quinn's good on the phone.  Kevin Smith.  Kevin Smith. 
[01:44:00]  Kevin Smith's real good on the phone.  Edward Norton.  When he's not smoking pot.  Edward Norton's good on the phone.  Where's Kevin lately?  Michael Madsen.  Michael Madsen.  Was he good on the phone?  I'm trying to remember.  He was good everywhere.  We got to have him back in the fucking studio.  I fucking love that guy.  He's had a bunch of really good stories on the phone.  He was really good when he was in studio, especially.  Intimidating as all hell, but.  Leonard.  Leonard was great on the phone, Anthony.  Where are we at with that bit?  I don't know.  A lot of controversy around here.  I know.  I guess we do edgy radio.  I'm not really sure sometimes if we do edgy radio or not. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Are we able to replay it?  I don't know.  Because we're not able to replay it because, you know, they have to keep everything uber safe  around here.  Of course.  Safety first.  Then we don't do the O&A countdown this weekend because it's embarrassing to do an O&A countdown  without the top bit.  Without that being the fucking number one bit.  Sam's running down the hall.  Sam.  Oh, let me see.  You know something?  He's not running.  He's walking very slowly.  Well, when you turned around, he stopped running.  Sam, what do you know on the McDonald's bit? 
[01:45:00]  Wow.  Let's call it the Leonard bit.  Leonard.  Well, as of now, there's not an official word, but we need a word either way by this  afternoon because the law was put down that if that doesn't get to be number one, there  will be no worst of the week countdown.  Because you can't do it.  It's embarrassing for us.  It's embarrassing.  When it's obvious, that would be the number one this week and it's not there.  Come on.  Just fucking replay it. 
[01:45:30]  What is it?  What's going to happen?  When you watch a movie or a TV show, people play parts all the time.  Anthony was playing a part.  There's no big fucking deal about that.  Everyone involved.  We're entertainers.  We just got to start telling everyone.  We're just entertainers.  Yeah.  You know, we're playing parts on the show every morning.  Yeah.  With, you know, based on our character.  It's like Seinfeld.  His show was called Seinfeld.  His name on the show was Jerry Seinfeld.  Sure.  But that wasn't. 
[01:46:00]  And he was a comedian.  Sure.  On the show.  It was a comic.  And that was a part of his personality.  But that wasn't Jerry Seinfeld.  Seinfeld, I'm Anthony Cumia.  I do a radio show.  Seinfeld.  Let's go back to that.  Some dude played George Steinbrenner, right?  Yes.  Was there ever a problem?  They never asked George Steinbrenner, hey, can we play you on Seinfeld?  They just did it.  Yes.  Because that actor was playing a part. 
[01:46:30]  Do you know who that actor was?  Yes, I do.  Who?  I do.  Who?  I'll tell you after the break.  No.  Oh, fuck.  We just came back from break.  On a tease?  I can't Google right now.  Fuck.  It's a little trivia, but you can't.  Travis, by the way.  So easy.  Knows everything.  About Seinfeld?  About Seinfeld.  You play that game.  What was that game?  Dude, he got Seinfeld Seen It.  Yeah.  And I went over his house one day, and he was like, oh, let's play Seinfeld Seen It.  Because he hadn't played it yet.  I didn't even get to answer a question.  He just ran through the game. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  It was me, my chick, and Danny and his at the time chick.  Yeah.  And they played three against me.  Three against you, and you won.  I killed him.  He knew stuff.  He's like, oh, this one's so easy.  And then he would be some obscure answer that I would never know.  Yeah.  Travis knows everything about Seinfeld.  Larry David played.  Larry David was Seinbrenner.  That's like playing Scrabble with somebody, and you're like, yeah, that'll be fun.  And you have a few words, and you're excited.  And then this idiot studies the game and knows all those weird two-letter words. 
[01:47:30]  It's an ass-kicking.  We had a great time.  Fuck that shit.  It's an ass-kicking, man.  We had a great time.  It's not even fun.  It's an ass-kicking is what you're getting.  So, yeah, Larry David played a few parts.  Larry David also played Frank Costanza's lawyer with the cape.  The cape.  The guy with the cape.  Exactly.  He also played the bodega owner who wouldn't accept George's $20 bill.  Yes.  Nice.  With the lipstick on it.  Right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With the lipstick.  Wait, Larry David was George Steinbrenner?  Yeah.  He did the voice, yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:48:00]  It was the guy doing the voice.  I just learned something.  They actually tried to get George Steinbrenner for the final episode.  Really?  But it didn't work out, no.  Why didn't it work out?  That is so great.  The way he's got his hands on his hips with the cape.  Curb your enthusiasm.  It's just amazing.  My favorite episode is where he befriends the sex offender because the sex offender fixed  his golf swing and then he brings him to a party.  He's all excited to have others meet his new friend and they all know he's the sex offender. 
[01:48:30]  He's the pedophile or the sex offender.  Yeah, where he had a register and everything.  That fucking Larry David, man.  Is there anyone funnier than him right now on TV?  Very good.  And he's going to have a great show.  New season starts Sunday.  Yeah, and it's them talking about the Seinfeld reunion.  It's genius.  Isn't it going to be, they're going to talk about Seinfeld all season long, right?  No, it's only like five episodes.  Five episodes.  Oh, that's a lot of episodes.  It's a lot of episodes.  They only do about 12, right?  And it's going to be all of them coming back.  They brought back all the sets and everything. 
[01:49:00]  I saw pictures.  Wow, that's fucking cool.  It's going to be really cool.  It should be cool.  It's the closest thing to a reunion you're going to get.  I know Newman's in it.  Really?  Skinny Newman?  Are they going to address the fact that he's not fat anymore?  I know.  Newman's skinny now?  Yeah, Newman's skinny.  Well, not skinny, but he's lost a lot of weight.  He definitely is not as fat as he used to be.  Probably got his stomach stapled.  Remember Banya, the comedian?  Yes.  Banya.  Banya.  And George's parents.  You know what?  I didn't even know it started Sunday. 
[01:49:30]  Yep.  What time?  I got to set the old DVR.  10 o'clock.  Love it.  On what, ABC?  No.  I know, dude.  That's like an NBC joke because everyone knows it was on NBC and we know it's on cable.  It was just, I was just trying to be, oh boy.  Only on HBO.  That naughty lab tech was arrested officially for the murder of the Elfstein.  Oh, they finally got them?  Yes.  That naughty lab.  No surprise there.  No surprise at all.  Why don't we do the caller's bombing finally?  Also in the news, really quick.  That's just right there. 
[01:50:00]  Hold on.  What?  Why don't we do the caller's bombing now immediately?  Oh, by the way, there was a story.  I know.  Well, this is how we are.  The listeners are going like, we're talking good.  Fucking asshole.  We don't even have to play the audio.  The DC sniper will be executed sometime in November.  It's supposed to be November.  Is that the first execution in this country in a while?  Because I don't even think Texas kills people in a while.  Texas is great.  Are they still killing people?  Oh, yes.  Every eight minutes.  Well, that's how it used to be.  I don't know.  He will get a stay for another appeal.  Enough time hasn't gone by for this guy to be killed.  He will absolutely get another stay for more appeals. 
[01:50:30]  Give me a break.  Call it as bombing, Anthony.  Yes.  Oh, but first, Lennon McMahon.  I was just continuing the bit you started.  Oh, right.  See?  And I wasn't even surprised.  No.  Because that's just the way it works.  It's not even a bit.  Do we care that Lennon McMahon leaves the WWE to run for Senate?  What's her platform?  What is she registered as?  You know what?  A Democrat or a Republican? 
[01:51:00]  I would say Republican.  Who's she going after?  Who's up there?  Dodd, I think?  Is that Dodd's territory?  Jodd.  Kneel before Dodd.  She is the brains behind the body slant, and 60-year-old Linda McMahon is serious about  running for Chris Dodd's U.S. Senate seat.  McMahon resigned her position as WWE wrestling CEO, but she's using her television savvy to  launch a professional media campaign from this Stanford studio.  The folks in Connecticut have lost faith and trust in Senator Dodd, and so I think when 
[01:51:30]  that happens to a public official, it's time to step out of the way.  Indeed, Senator Chris Dodd may be vulnerable to a Republican challenger.  He was cleared of wrongdoing after allegations he got preferential treatment from countrywide  mortgage on his personal home loan.  Still, Dodd's poll numbers are down, and this former wrestling exec is hoping to keep him  pinned.  Well, Dodd's not squeaky clean either, so I think they'll probably match up pretty well,  but I think it'll be the unclean guy versus the Babe Rassler. 
[01:52:00]  Wow.  Is there one politician that's honest and has a squeaky clean record?  Yes.  Jimmy Carter.  No.  I think he's honest.  Oh, he is not.  I think he is.  He's a hypocrite, and he lies to himself.  Oh, shit.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, shit.  You didn't see that.  Thank you.  This is an odd scenario and question.  Let's say she wins.  Okay?  Okay.  And I would never, this is a scenario, I would never wish any ill will upon anybody, but let's 
[01:52:30]  see tragedy strikes, and she loses her life in some way, shape, or form.  You know how the spouse takes over?  Would Vince McMahon then take over?  Yeah.  He would.  Hell yeah.  Senator Vince McMahon.  He'll probably kill her if she wins.  This is a work.  This is a work.  Poor ability.  I'm in a Senate.  Right.  Year five.  No, he walks out into fucking, he walks up to the podiums. 
[01:53:00]  He's the only one that has entrance music in the Senate.  Yeah, he's the only one that has entrance music.  Everyone has to stop what they're doing because Vince has arrived.  I propose a law.  That everyone has to wear wrestling tights.  What?  Why would that be a, that's a dumb law.  Just body slamming people.  Senator McMahon, what about earmarks?  What about earmarks, sir?  Earmarks, you could kiss my ass.  Sir.  Earmarks.  You can't just say kiss my ass. 
[01:53:30]  What do you think?  I want to introduce a new wrestler.  Pork Barrel.  Pork Barrel.  High taxes is coming out of fight Pork Barrel.  Yeah.  That would be great.  Senator Vince McMahon.  So you think if Linda wins, she'll step into her car and it'll blow up on the first day?  It'll blow up the first day in office.  It's a whole work.  Vince will come out.  But it won't be on any mainstream news.  Wow.  And she'll show up at the Senate.  But people watching wrestling will see Senator Vince McMahon. 
[01:54:00]  Of course.  And they'll have to call him Senator.  Oh my God, the Senator's out here.  That would be fantastic.  But, you know, it would mean the demise of Linda McMahon, which we would never want to see.  Nope.  We love Linda McMahon.  She's been great to us over the years.  Hey, there was a squeaky clean politician.  Jay from Huntington has it.  Yes.  Jimmy Tide.  Let's not forget about Jimmy Tide.  Jimmy Tide.  I'm just reading.  Very squeaky clean.  Yes.  I'm reading in caps.  Kevin from Connecticut. 
[01:54:30]  For the love of Christ, play the listeners bombing.  I have to know if I'm on there.  People are so mad when we say we're going to play something.  We don't.  Don't you understand?  Look.  We toy with you.  Look in.  It's right here.  Look.  I know.  Look.  All right.  We've got to do it before Joel McHale calls at 9 o'clock, so.  I just watched.  Look.  Listen.  Listen.  There it is.  It's in the player.  We're ready to go.  Oh.  Hotline's ringing.  I think Joel is on the phone. 
[01:55:00]  No, he's not.  I'm fucking with the listeners yet again.  But speaking of phones.  Yes.  Oh, that one's getting taken out.  Remember we were talking about Jessica Simpson's dog yesterday?  Yes.  Jessica Simpson's dog.  She's very sad.  Got eaten by a coyote.  Supposedly the coyote took the dog right in front of her?  Yep.  And now she's really hoping that the coyote will do the right thing and not eat it alive.  And return the dog.  Right.  You know, she's appealing to the coyote to return her little fucking poodle something mix.  She's like, if you have, Catherine. 
[01:55:30]  Well, thanks.  That's great.  Sam, what's this automated phone thing about with Jessica Simpson?  I just thought it was funny.  She filled out one of those things online where it calls all your neighbors and alerts all the neighbors that your dog is missing as if the neighbor might find the dog.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  If the neighbor's a coyote.  Maybe she has a case here.  Well, I could call my neighbors.  No, the service calls the neighbor. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, I want to do that.  You don't have a dog?  I don't know.  I'll figure out something, though.  The cutest dog ever.  Daisy.  Her name is Daisy.  I think so.  That's what Jimmy was saying.  Her name is Daisy.  Yeah.  He's very smart.  Yeah.  Paul R. Nelson was an honest politician, too.  Let's not forget.  Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Probably the most honest politician ever to run for office.  Travis, you better find me some Paul R. Nelson for the break. 
[01:56:30]  But first, here's the automated phone notice from Jessica Simpson.  This is a lost pet alert from your neighbor, Jessica.  She lost her dog, Daisy, on September 14th.  Daisy is a honey-colored 10-pound multi-tip.  If you have seen her or can help, please call.  You can also view your neighbor's lost pet and their contact info at findtoto.org.  Wait a minute.  Was there a website there? 
[01:57:00]  Oh, was there?  That we could check out?  That's org.  Doesn't she understand that they eat the dog?  They don't take it.  They don't have sex with it and then have puppies with it.  And then it turns up 18 years later.  They don't keep it in a vault underneath the house.  They don't.  It ate your dog.  It's now coyote shit in the woods.  Not only did the coyote eat this dog, other animals are eating the leftovers.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:57:30]  It's the circle of life.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's the circle of life.  Time for the callers bombing.  Ah, callers bombing.  Yeah, we suggested this a while ago.  So soon.  Because, you know, you guys enjoy when we bomb on a daily basis.  So we're like, you know what?  Fuck you.  You guys don't do a good job every day either.  Their average isn't very good.  And then we forgot about it.  And then Travis did not.  And he's been collecting bad callers bombing.  I got distracted because Bretton Vegas, another honest politician. 
[01:58:00]  Yes.  Bud R. Dwyer or R. Bud Dwyer.  Yes, he was.  R. Bud Dwyer was very â€“  R. Bud Dwyer.  Probably amongst the most honest of politicians.  That's right.  Because the second he realized he did something wrong, he fixed that problem.  That's what all politicians should do.  Yes.  He said, this hat doesn't fit me right.  Let me get it off my head immediately.  All right.  Here we go.  Here is the first caller bombing.  We got ten of these.  He should set up the ring in the parking lot. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, yeah.  Raw is going to be on next Monday from Denver.  I don't doubt it.  That's a developing story.  We'll have to wait and see.  Victor the Trucker.  Victor.  Hey, morning.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  All right.  Hey, I think there should be a tag team match.  Get a couple wrestlers against a couple of the ballplayers and best out of three.  You know, whoever wins gets to have the venue for the night.  Then what would happen?  You do it that night.  That way everybody is happy. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, but then what happens?  How does the game get played, though?  Well, you know, you use your third string players.  You know, don't use your first string.  But I'm saying, like, how would they get all the people in for one and then out for the other?  It doesn't make sense.  Oh, it makes plenty of sense.  You know, what you do is, first off, you contact Ted's Emporium.  You get a couple people to bring in some movable rings.  You know what?  That was a good joke.  You guys screwed it up.  I thought he blames all of us. 
[01:59:30]  There you go.  The first one from Victor the Trucker.  He stunk.  Victor the Trucker.  As we do Caller's Bombing here.  Oh, we know this next trucker.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, boy.  Do we know this next trucker?  Oh, okay.  All right.  Which one is it going to be?  Is it Lady Trucker or is it?  Let's go to Lady Trucker.  It's the worst fucking improver in history.  LT, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hello.  Yeah, that second segment you played, the guys are, it was gay talk for Steve's wearing 
[02:00:00]  women's pants.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  I'm punching out.  We were trying to go.  I don't know what she was getting at.  That was so bad.  Wow, did she bomb.  That was a great bombing by Lady Trucker.  Holy shit.  What a thud.  That sounded like her being dropped through your roof from a helicopter. 
[02:00:30]  I, I, I, I, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, just a wet splash with plaster  all over the room.  Eee, yuck.  Is this going well?  Should we continue?  Of course.  All right.  Here's the next one.  Let's say hi to Tony in Maryland.  Tony.  Tony.  Hey.  What's up?  I just wanted to say, I think McCain will start looking like Dan Aykroyd in nothing but  trouble.  Vulcanizer.  And then he goes, with his nose coming off and everything like that. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Not one of, not one of, uh, Aykroyd's more popular movies.  Wait, I actually couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't hear the line.  What, what line did you actually say?  Yeah.  Jimmy, uh, just, uh, entered the studio here.  His, his, he looked like who?  Dan Aykroyd.  I heard you.  I love that.  Ah, what a dick.  All right. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, I remember this one.  Yeah.  Remember Brian?  Brian.  No.  Brian the caller?  Sure I will.  You'll remember this.  Brian in the Poconos is not a fan of, uh, Steve the Whistler.  What's wrong?  What's wrong, Brian?  Good evening.  Hello.  Hey, happy birthday there, sugar nipples.  Hey, Brian.  Let's all just have a slower laugh today.  This is the guy, we should take him and fucking, uh, get him a chimpanzee and let him go bring  a cake to him and let his fucking chimp get rid of his ribs off. 
[02:02:00]  This is going great.  We'll see you guys forever.  Wow.  Holy shit, those, these are cringeworthy.  That was a monumental bomb.  Oh, fuck.  His brain could not fucking get to his mouth in time.  He was stuttering and having a stroke.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Hum-a-hum-a-hum-a-hum-a-hum-a-hum-a-hum-a-hum-a-hum.  Dude, could we please hear that one one more time? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a bomb of epic proportions.  Hall of Famer.  Yeah.  Brian in the Poconos is not a fan of, uh, Steve the Whistler.  What's wrong?  What's wrong, Brian?  Good evening.  Hello.  Hey, happy birthday there, sugar nipples.  Hey, Brian.  Let's all just have a similar laugh today.  This is going great. 
[02:03:00]  We'll see you guys forever.  Wow.  Holy mackerel that he shit the bed.  Oh, man.  That could be the best one.  That's a great one.  That is taking both your balls and shoving them in your mouth and just nibbling.  He looked like he was trying to deliver a joke while standing in the middle of a fucking crossfire.  Like he was trying to look out for bullets and get the joke out quickly.  Holy shit.  Holy shit. 
[02:03:30]  It's going to pain me to play the next one.  This person has done so much for the Opie and Anthony show.  Really?  Do you have Coke Logic or Steven?  We know it's not so much.  Steve C. or E-Rock.  Take that, stupid and stupid.  Poor E-Rock.  He hasn't even done anything.  Exactly.  You know what he's doing right now?  He's just sweating and just trying to get something to contribute to the show.  Where is he right now?  All he thinks about is the show 24 hours a day. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, I know.  He's always archiving things that no one will ever need.  Right.  He does.  This is times you started sentences with a verb in the mid-80s.  Thanks, asshole face.  He is the king of busy work.  E-Rock knows busy.  He knows how to keep himself busy with just mundane tasks.  Oh, when the brass walks by and looks in that office, he is fucking looking like he's working.  Oh, yeah.  All right, here we go.  It's the creator of American Day. 
[02:04:30]  It is Coke Logic.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  Where can the people check out American Day?  He begged me to retweet that yesterday.  Yeah, I know.  Did you retweet?  He was on my ass about it, too.  But I didn't retweet.  I was on the shitter this morning.  I usually don't before I take a pre-leave-for-work dump, so I didn't have time.  I don't know.  Where is it?  All right.  Whatever.  Danny will find it.  But here's Coke Logic as we listen to some of the callers bombing over the last couple of months or so. 
[02:05:00]  Sam, we got one of your fans on the line.  Very, very good news.  Oh, it's actually Coke Logic.  Coke Logic, a fan of Sam.  Yes.  Good evening.  Hey, Coke Logic.  I am a fan of Sam, but I think we could do two birds with one stone.  Two birds with one stone on an asshole.  You still there?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  That's rough.  You had a chance to step back on the gas there.  He was really hoping that there would just be a dial tone at that point. 
[02:05:30]  Yes, we're still here at Coke Logic.  I was really hoping you guys cut me off to spare me there.  There goes Coke Logic.  It's tinyurl.com slash americaday.  If you haven't checked that out yet, please do so if you're a fan of the show.  That tiny URL thing.  That thing.  My goodness.  And I didn't know you could make your own.  It's a stupid me.  Make your own.  I put it in there.  You just keep some paper mache and paint.  And it's all some letters and numbers, and you don't know if it's a zero or an O.  You get all confused. 
[02:06:00]  It's easy.  You can make your own.  I didn't know that.  It's a great website, though.  tinyurl.com.  In this case, slash americaday.  The next bomb from the caller, Ant.  Wow, this is a long one.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Let's listen to Marie bombing.  Marie.  Hold on a minute.  My God.  Marie in North Carolina.  Marie.  That's great.  Yeah.  The song playing on the radio, Pussy Control.  Yep.  How you guys doing? 
[02:06:30]  I listen to you guys all the time.  That's the first time I've ever got on the radio.  And what song we're playing?  Pussy Control.  Yep.  Pussy Control.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  So why are you calling about that?  Huh?  Why are you calling about that?  I can't hear you.  I'm in a real bad area.  I'm in North Carolina right now.  I'm traveling.  Yeah.  Why are you calling about the song we're playing? 
[02:07:00]  Well, because I've been trying to get through to tell you the name of the song on the radio  that was playing while he was raping her.  Jesus.  Oh.  Wow.  See.  Yeah.  Pussy Control was playing on the radio.  Ah.  Because he was.  Yeah.  In control of the food.  Right.  What? 
[02:07:30]  That one was so bad.  It just made me uncomfortable.  Yeah.  I didn't even know what it was.  That was so bad.  That one wasn't fun.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It was like.  What the fuck?  And then we're trying to make something out of it.  We're trying to shape something out of shit.  Next one, Anthony.  Who is this?  Nick.  Yeah.  Nick in New Mexico.  Nick.  Yeah.  Good morning, guys.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There's only so many good contractors in New York, and you know they've got all the good  ones for Yankee Stadium. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  Hold on.  What did you just do, Jimmy?  Hold on.  We have to address something that just happened.  Will you pay attention, please?  We're playing the calls that bombed, callers that have bombed, and as we played it, Jimmy  answered the recording.  Can we replay that, Travis?  You're going to hear two Jimmy's.  You're going to hear the recorded Jimmy saying, thank you, whatever, and then you're going  to hear him say it live today.  Sounds like paradise.  He's got his head down.  Oh, my God.  He had his head down doing something, and he heard Jimmy. 
[02:08:30]  Travis, you got that?  Anthony, don't gloat.  You once answered a fart.  Yes, I did.  Travis is getting that.  Yeah, he'll take it away.  He's like going with his lithe fingers.  Yeah, his very thin, slender, feminine fingers.  Oh, they're calling him Choke Logic now.  That's not nice.  That's not nice, Steven S. from Bayshore.  Steven S. very confident, because Steven S. doesn't call the show.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:09:00]  That's why he can throw out his little barbs.  Throw your barbs.  All right, go ahead.  Next one, Anthony.  Who is this?  Nick.  Yeah, Nick in New Mexico.  Nick.  Yeah, good morning, guys.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You asshole.  Oh, that's great.  Thank you.  You're two Jimmy's.  Yeah, good morning, guys.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  They've cloned Jimmy. 
[02:09:30]  This happened.  That's good.  Now you could do Jay and the show at the same time.  Yes.  That's good news.  More Jimmy's, more gooder.  One more time.  Yeah, good morning, guys.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Now there's three.  I figure the more, the merrier.  At least that's my motto.  Jimmy just added a third ad.  See, that's what we just did there.  Yeah.  Oh, we're very clever.  All right.  Here's Nick bombing. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Nick in New Mexico.  Nick.  Yeah.  Good morning, guys.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you, Nick.  There's only so many good contractors in New York, and you know they've got all the good  ones for Yankee Stadium.  Oh.  Click.  I love the sound of the phone as it's going back to the thing.  He spun into the Sea of Japan.  There were no survivors.  Oh, fuck.  Radar should have announced that call. 
[02:10:30]  Put a mask on.  It's good to see the callers feeling like we do on a regular basis.  The instant feedback is just lit with people going, I'm nervous as shit here.  That it's going to be them.  Them.  Yep.  Kevin from Connecticut writes that.  Oh, yeah.  As well as a few others.  Well, now, I don't want people to think that this is all I have.  Oh, you're holding back.  Oh, we can only do so many at a time.  Oh, my God.  That's why it's labeled volume one.  You got volume two.  Volume one.  Travis has got a bit for the radio show. 
[02:11:00]  Nice.  Although they like you on video, Travis.  I'm very videogenic.  I'll add that to bombs.  Yes, perhaps you should.  Why, videogenic is funny when you take two words and put them together.  Here we go.  I wish I could see his dumb face through that reflection.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  Anthony, a very familiar voice bombing as we continue with Caller Bombs Volume 1.  I love how the celebrities are calling in lately.  This is great. 
[02:11:30]  Well, you know, we're a hit show, Ant.  It's about time.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Larry King.  Larry.  Hello, gentlemen.  Hi, Larry.  What I want to know is if the governor goes down there, how the hell is he going to see anything?  Oh, Larry.  Don't comment.  Boo!  Oh, is that awful?  Yeah.  These guys don't walk around here. 
[02:12:00]  They're distracting us.  Tell them to stop looking at us.  They're peering.  Fuck.  They're peering.  They walk by us.  And they're looky-loos.  I hate that.  Here's another bomb from a caller, Anthony.  John and Buffalo.  Just snap them over my knee and laugh.  Hey, boys.  I've learned two things today.  Yes, sir.  One is the only thing gayer than being in the U.S. Navy is being in the Indian Navy.  And that Mr. Faber-Sham is the one who's behind the Nigerian scans. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  We're going to bring back Lion of the Day.  We're going to bring back Lion of the Day.  That was so bad.  It didn't make sense.  Why would Mr. Faber-Sham be in charge of the...  Like, what...  I know, sir.  Why don't you just throw a wet bag of shit at the wall and go,  I don't even know if this is good. 
[02:13:00]  They're so bad.  No, they're really bad.  That it's good?  Yeah.  Travis has labeled this one, the last one for today.  We'll do this sooner than later, by the way.  We'll bring this back very soon, Travis, okay?  The greatest bomb ever in the history of callers is what this one has labeled.  Fuck.  That's a tough order.  Let's get right to it.  Jamie in Alabama.  Hey.  Opie.  Yeah.  Man, we were flying to Costa Rica one time. 
[02:13:30]  And it was awesome.  This chick got me in the back.  Gave me a good blowjob.  She was a stewardess.  That's what this is.  See, I could have done that.  That sounds like five different stories coming to one.  That is the worst story I've ever heard.  Dude.  I love that guy.  She was a stewardess.  Get it?  All right.  Volume two in the near future. 
[02:14:00]  All right?  Yes.  So Joel McHale is going to call in a few minutes.  Yeah.  We also have the best of Wendy Williams.  We can start this.  The best of Wendy Williams.  Yeah.  We've been watching the monster.  I mean, she's the new thing on TV.  They're really pushing her big time.  They want her to be the new Oprah.  Oh, yeah.  Or the new Tyra Banks.  Oh, her too.  Because Tyra's going to move up to the Oprah spot, I think.  I don't know.  But we've been watching Wendy Williams very closely, and we put together the best of Wendy Williams. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Let us hear it.  Is everyone all right?  Yeah, why?  Okay.  Is everyone all right?  Sam, what do we got on the best of Wendy Williams?  Ah, Sam, our entertainment director.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like that.  I've been watching Wendy Williams as of late, and I wanted to bring in some clips that show  you guys all the different dimensions of her personality.  Ah, very good.  Maybe you will turn around your sort of close-minded, negative ways as far as the way you talk about 
[02:15:00]  Wendy.  Oh, maybe.  Word on the street is she's awful, Sam.  Well, she's doing very well.  Word on the street is she cries a lot, Sam.  Really?  Word on the street is she says, how you doing?  A lot.  That's not how she says it.  How does she say it?  That's her catchphrase.  Yeah, but that's not...  I appreciate a good catchphrase.  You know that, Ant.  Yes, I know.  What were some of my catchphrases?  What's some obvious catchphrase?  Brother man? 
[02:15:30]  What's wrong with the motherhuckers we got?  They catchphrase pretty good.  That's right, motherhuckers.  That's a wheeze one, though.  I attempted brother man.  That didn't really take off.  I can't believe that one didn't fucking take off.  That shit went all over shirts and bumper stickers.  Kind of disappointed, Jimmy.  Brother man.  Stupid brother man.  But it was brother man, brother man.  I forgot.  Wait, you wouldn't say it twice.  I actually don't believe you would do that. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, and let's not forget a boo-boo-boo.  Yes, yes, a boo-boo-boo.  What was that?  It was an abbreviation?  That was old.  Well, you know, when you're trying to be a cool music jock, you got to have some kind  of cool out.  And a lot of people do like, shit.  Right.  So that turned into a boo-boo-boo.  Turned into a boo-boo-boo.  Do we have a recording of that?  Hell fucking no.  Come on, there has to be one.  Whoever plays it gets fired.  How ironic.  A boo-boo-boo. 
[02:16:30]  Right, exactly.  Thanks.  All right, why don't we just get into this?  So, uh, the best of Wendy Williams, Sam.  That's right.  And look, see?  I'm a seer.  The first track, How You Doing?  I told you.  Well, yeah, but you weren't saying it right.  She explains how to say it.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Incidentally, America, I know that some of you are wondering, what is How You Do It?  See?  How You Do It?  How You Do It?  That's better.  How You Do It?  Tell me that's not a tranny, Sam. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, I know.  That's not a tranny.  That's Miss Wendy.  Who did that song, You Gotta Work?  Like, fucking...  Rupaul.  Rupaul.  Sounds very Rupaul-ish.  Who did that song?  Definitely looks Rupaul-ish.  Yeah.  I know that some of you are wondering, what is How You Do It?  How You Doing is the official greeting of the Wendy Williams mess.  You don't say it like Joey Tribbiani from Friends, How You Do It?  No.  You say it like this, and I'm going to teach you, and then we're going to go to the Queen of Sheba.  Look.  You dim your eyes like this. 
[02:17:30]  And when you get to the end of doing, you spread your bottom lip.  I'll do it once, and then go to my website, and you can take lessons.  Okay, look, look.  How You Do It?  Hopefully, we'll have many years together to work on it.  That just made me angry.  Why?  How You Do It?  Because this isn't a fucking webcam.  This is like national TV. 
[02:18:00]  And why are they eating it up?  Broadcast TV, too, not cable.  Yeah, yeah.  It's about time, man.  I think it's time for us to get a little TV show going.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like what?  One of these talk show things?  You guys should go into daytime talk.  How You Do It?  And can I hear your How You Do It?  How You Do It?  How You Do It?  Jimmy's got a good one, too, I know.  How You Do It?  How You Do It?  But you're not, like, spreading the lip.  How You Do It?  How You Do It? 
[02:18:30]  Oh, no.  Ted.  Ted Williams.  Oh, well, we can't use that one.  No, Ted Williams.  No, not really.  I think I got one.  Hey, how You Do It?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  All right.  She is, uh...  How You Do It?  How You Do It?  Wendy adjusts her makeup.  This is, like, the best of Wendy Williams.  We've been watching very closely, because a lot of people are like, come on, man, give  her a chance.  You just started on TV.  You're jealous, because she's a radio person, you know, moving into the TV world, and that's  something you guys want to do, and blah, blah, blah. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Actually, no one has said that to me.  I just think that every day, Sam.  They fuck this radio shit.  TV is fun.  All right, Jimmy.  Oh, now Jimmy knows it.  My friends at NBC treat me good.  Oh.  Unlike this place, huh?  I love NBC.  A little different, huh, Jimmy?  It's like, really?  Are you sure you're dealing with Jim Norton?  It's so weird how two companies can be so different, and how they treat their employees,  by the way. 
[02:19:30]  In any walk of life, you deal with that.  Like, you know, one place is one way, another place is, like, another way.  It's like, wow.  You mean, really?  Was that a caller?  That's one of the calls.  Whatever.  Someday.  It'll be known.  Here we go.  Wendy adjusts her makeup live on the air and sigs into Ted Kennedy dying.  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, boy.  Hey, Morrell.  I think I have some lipstick on my cheek.  Morrell?  Watch this.  Morrell?  Well, what's he doing upstairs?  Upstairs in the makeup room.  Do I have lipstick on my cheek?  Do I have lipstick on my cheek?  Yes.  Sorry.  Don't wipe so hard.  You're taking the makeup off.  Anyway, everybody, I'm glad that you guys are here today.  And I was really sorry when I woke up this morning to hear, as you did also, about Senator Ted Kennedy, who passed away last night. 
[02:20:30]  77 years old.  He had a malignant brain tumor.  And he was the last surviving Kennedy brother.  So, you know, the political dynasty.  So, shout out to the Kennedy family.  We're sorry to hear about your loss.  So, she went from, like, getting her makeup touched up to a death dedication.  Hey, stop.  You're going to take my makeup off.  So, Kennedy's dead.  But at least the Kennedy did get a shout out.  Shout out to the Kennedy family.  Sounds like she's just, like, talking to preschoolers. 
[02:21:00]  No.  Right?  She is, pretty much.  Mentally.  Wendy smoothly segs into a pre-produced video.  Yeah, you know, like in TV shows, when you get a video ready, like, you know, way ahead of time.  So, you're like, and here it is.  This is one of those.  Sam, I don't know if this is working.  Well, you know what?  Anthony, is this working?  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.  Because she's, you know.  Yeah, it's working.  A lot of it is also in the confidence.  If you know it's working, it's working. 
[02:21:30]  So, I have to just be more confident?  That's the secret.  Visualize that it's working.  Know that it's working.  And then, you know what, Opie?  Then it's working.  Watch this for confidence.  Sit up straight.  Yes.  Push your chest out a little bit.  Much better.  See, I'm all confident now.  And it translates.  That'll change once you play the next clip.  I'll slump right back down.  Dear Wendy, I love you and absolutely everything about your show.  Your wigs, your clothes, the set, the hot topics.  But, I have to ask you, what is up with all those flies in your studio? 
[02:22:00]  You're always swatting them.  You gotta take care.  Holy shit, Sam.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  Nothing, Sam.  Why are there flies in our studio, Sam?  You know, it's a TV studio.  I don't know.  Are you secretly working for the man and trying to get us fired?  What are you talking about?  Nothing.  We don't have self-control, Sam.  I'm just pulling clips from Wendy Williams.  Why is she swatting flies, Sam?  She's got all these flies around her.  I don't know.  Is she actually swatting them? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Because, oh.  Watson wants to throw the person.  No, no.  Steve Rambach always has a comment I can't read, but I'm laughing hysterically at.  Well, obviously, we're all thinking this right off the bat.  Of course.  Okay.  Let me have a sharpie.  Sure, here.  What'd you say?  Well, she said swatting, so that's the number one answer on the board right there.  I don't know.  Ant's writing one, though.  Mm-hmm.  Okay. 
[02:23:00]  Mm-hmm.  Hold on.  Mm-hmm.  I like filling up the dead air with...  Yeah, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe just a new studio, so they bring in the new set, some flies, you know.  Mm-hmm.  Jesus Christ.  She could swat a lot of flies, huh?  No, well, she apparently does.  I don't know how that works.  Here's your sharpie, sir.  Oh, sheesh.  Anybody else have one?  Ah.  Okay.  No, I did, but it was in the same vein as you two.  Of course. 
[02:23:30]  It's so obvious.  Dear Wendy, I love you and absolutely everything about your show.  Your wigs, your clothes, the set, the hot topics.  But I have to ask you, what is up with all those flies in your studio?  You're always swatting them.  You've got to take care of this problem, Wendy.  Love the show.  Well, I've got something.  Do you remember when Barack Obama recently was fast enough to catch a fly with his hand?  I'm not quite that fast.  However, I have the traditional fly swatter.  In addition to that, I've got the fly. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, wait.  We have a fly video?  Do we have?  Okay.  Of me swatting the flies.  Oh, this is good.  Go.  I didn't know you guys got this prepared.  There's a fly in here.  And that isn't really, that isn't really something you want to put out on the air that you're surrounded  by flies all the time.  I didn't know what the fuck the flies are all about.  What is this?  Who else had flies around them constantly?  Who?  I'm not even going for a joke, but some knowledge. 
[02:24:30]  Andre the Giant.  Really?  The one time I saw him wrestle in Rochester, New York.  I've told the story a million times.  Flies followed the fucking guy the entire match.  It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen.  The guy smells.  Like when you see a horse and a horse is just swatting constantly.  Yeah, they got their tail going whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.  That's what, Andre the Giant had flies that followed him.  Into the ring, out of the ring, while he was in the ring.  That's all we focused on.  Like what the fuck is up with the flies around Andre the Giant?  So it means he stinks. 
[02:25:00]  No.  There's something going on there.  No, it does.  It does.  Why else are flies in there?  Just because it's an old TV studio and they're, you know, moving and all that stuff.  Oh, is that it?  Maybe.  I think so.  A lot of people know exactly what we're talking about, by the way.  They're very smart out there.  Of course they are.  They've got our references.  They're geniuses.  Well, let's continue.  Wendy responds to a Chris Brown tweet.  Is this really working?  Yeah, I think so.  And this is, now we're moving into.  It's working at it?  Is it?  Yeah, yeah.  I like it.  I like the fly thing. 
[02:25:30]  It was good.  We're moving into some sassiness now.  All right.  She responds to a Chris Brown tweet.  That's right.  I just learned that Chris Brown was leaving an airport.  His Twitter name is Mechanical Dummy.  And he Twittered that one of the men around him reminded him of me, Wendy Williams.  In other words, he's calling me a man.  Well, you know what?  At least if I was a man, then I would spend my time bullying other men, perhaps, and not  other women.  That's got to hurt that big celebrities are calling her a man, not only us dummies. 
[02:26:00]  She's probably crying.  Yeah, but she's hurting.  How you doing?  She's hurting.  Well, she says how you doing like a guy to begin with, so.  I don't think so.  Is Joel McHale on the line?  He doesn't like Wendy Williams either.  No?  No.  Well, I don't know.  He might not.  I think he likes her, but he does use her for material. 
[02:26:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Why does it take so long to put these guys on hold?  Because we have to wait for them to get on the phone?  Yeah.  No, it's the publicity.  Hush now.  Ah, stupid.  Hush now.  My girlfriend hates that if we're arguing and we just set another argument.  I don't doubt that.  It's a startup.  Hush now.  Not a good thing to say.  All right.  Hush now.  Should we play another Wendy Williams?  Yeah, let's get another Wendy Williams.  Yeah, we got to start getting into Wendy Williams crying. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, does she cry when she gets inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame?  Of course.  Get the fuck out of here.  Didn't you guys?  We'll never be inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame.  Thanks, Sam.  Radio Hall of Fame?  They're never going to induct us.  You know that, right?  They put Wendy Williams in.  And if they do-  Are you out of your fucking mind?  And if they do, I'm not going and I'm not receiving anything from them.  Oh, yeah.  Just listening to her.  Are you out of your fucking mind?  Yeah.  I love that one.  He's talking to his wife after he had a drink in a bar where there was nobody and no liquor. 
[02:27:30]  She's just her being loopy.  Yeah.  Loopy.  Caller, are you there?  Yes, I am.  Hello, I'm Bruce Dumont, and I'm calling from Chicago.  I am chairman of the National Radio Hall of Fame, and I'm calling to let you know that  you have been selected for induction into America's only National Radio Hall of Fame. 
[02:28:00]  Anthony, let me ask you seriously.  Do you ever want that call?  For real?  Uh, yeah.  You do?  I want to be in the Radio Hall of Fame.  Sam, hug Anthony.  He's hurting.  Get away from me.  I'll fucking twink with hair.  Do you really want to be in the Hall of Fame of radio?  No.  It's okay to watch it.  No, you kind of do.  I can tell.  Well, it would be recognition of my accomplishments throughout my career.  What accomplishments?  Exactly. 
[02:28:30]  It's not an air award or anything.  Yeah.  We used to win awards, remember?  The air awards were fantastic.  We had a nice run there for a while.  Oh, my God.  We were winning awards.  No one wins awards anymore.  Who else is inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame?  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Okay.  Neil Bortz.  Hey, didn't Bob Grant not get inducted?  He was supposed to, and they fucking...  Oh, yeah.  They fucked him.  Neil Bortz.  Stupid Neil Bortz.  Who else?  Are these the inductees?  The great Dr. Demento. 
[02:29:00]  Wow.  I used to love Dr. Demento growing up, though.  Who didn't as a kid?  Who's Norman...  I can't even read the name, man.  Pattiz.  Pattiz?  Who's Norman Pattiz?  Pattiz?  Oh, he's good.  Pattiz.  I don't know.  He's some chairman of Westwood One.  The founder and chairman of Westwood One.  We love Westwood One.  So congratulations to Norman.  I like Westwood Two.  Who's Ed?  That wasn't bad.  Nah.  It was a throwaway, but it was a little too loud.  It should have been one of those back here.  I don't know what's with him.  Ed Walker.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  He should be in the Hall of Fame.  DC host of Play It Again, Ed, that aired on WMAL-AM.  Obviously.  Garnered one of the largest audiences in DC radio history.  Nice glasses.  Is he an X-Man?  Can he fire fucking light beams out of his eyeballs?  What the fuck is going on with that?  And then finally, rounding out the nominees, a very young Tracy Morgan with a wig.  That's not Tracy Morgan.  That's the queen.  I didn't know Tracy Morgan was doing radio, Sam. 
[02:30:00]  That's just...  That's not Tracy Morgan.  That's Wendy Williams, really?  That's Wendy Williams.  All right.  Let's say hi to our old pal, Joel McHale.  Joel.  Joel.  It is like hearing the voices of my uncles.  Ah.  You're on our shit list, Joel, because you didn't come in live.  I wanted to come in live, but I had to do the Today Show.  We're bigger than the Today Show.  Oh, look, Mr. I'm going to be on a real TV series on a real channel.  He's doing the Today Show.  You're the ones paying me. 
[02:30:30]  I see.  You're forgetting all your old friends that helped you get to the top, Joel.  What are your names again?  Exactly.  It was either us or the Today Show, huh?  Mark my words.  I would love to come in, and I will literally...  You won't be able to get rid of me next time I come in town.  Because we were just saying that.  We like you in studio, because then, you know, it just works.  Yeah.  It just works with you, you know?  Like I said, I'm one of your apps, and we can...  Yes.  We're not big fans of the phoner, but we made an exception for you, Joel McHale.  God bless you.  Well, I'll be back, and I really would love to come in, and I will bring Danish's. 
[02:31:00]  I've been watching The Soup of late.  I just heard you say Wendy Williams.  Yes.  One of my favorites.  Wendy Williams.  And...  But you know what?  You know what's going on with The Soup, though?  You're getting these people.  You're ragging them relentlessly.  Right.  And they actually are doing bits with you now.  Yeah.  They're like, help you...  Don't they realize you're not kidding when you say that they're horrible? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  They...  The great thing about reality stars, they...  No matter what it is, they want publicity, whether it's good or bad.  The number of skanks that have contacted us from the Rock of Love bus or from any of those shows is in the hundreds at this point.  And we go, we say horrible things about you.  They're like, yeah, I want to come on and have me say them to my face.  And I'm like, all right.  I mean, we gave Tila Tequila an award for Entertainer of the Year, and I was wearing a hazmat suit and handed her the award with Tom. 
[02:32:00]  And she didn't get the bit?  No.  And she was like, that's cool.  I'm like, all right.  Yeah, that's cool.  See, we're going to treat you like you're such a skank slut that I have to wear a hazmat suit or I'll catch a sexually transmitted disease.  Get it?  And she was like, sounds great.  That's because they want to be famous so bad.  Yeah.  I mean, that's what it's come down to.  They asked high schoolers a few years ago what they wanted to be when they grew up, and the number one answer was famous.  Wow. 
[02:32:30]  That's terrifying.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess it's good news for reality show producers.  And the soup.  Yeah, it's great for us because they keep adding channels and shows.  Joel, don't worry.  We're going to get to community in a minute or two, but there's a lot going on in pop culture, so we want to just run down a couple more of these.  First of all, Wendy Williams.  I'm so glad we're on the same page with this one.  And we saw her start her TV show, and we're like, oh, my God, she's a monster in a dress.  But she's much â€“ she's literally a hundred times more pleasant than Tyra Banks. 
[02:33:00]  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  What am I trying to say?  Yeah.  Anyone else?  I mean, I think they â€“  Exactly.  Yeah, okay.  We have a clip of her tonight showing Kanye West.  They're like, well, she was wondering, speculating on why he grabbed the mic.  Like â€“ and then they showed him on the red carpet with that bottle of Hennessy.  Right.  Yeah.  And then she starts â€“ this is the clip of her.  She starts going like, well, that's Joel McHale.  And then people are like, huh?  And she's like, I'm looking at a picture of Joel McHale.  I don't know what you're looking at. 
[02:33:30]  So once again, their production â€“ their crack team of production staffs â€“ staff just totally screwed up the photo.  So â€“ and that's what it made â€“ obviously made it on the show.  What do you think of the Kanye West â€“ Taylor Swift thing?  Well, I think he probably was drunk, don't you?  Yeah.  He seemed a little intoxicated.  He seems like he would have done that if he was sober, though, too.  He probably would have.  And then he â€“ didn't he cry on the new Jay Leno show?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  So I think he's â€“ has he been forgiven yet?  Yeah, I think it's kind of blown over.  Yeah, they're going to do a duet now.  It's going to be an album.  They're going to redo separate lives that Phil Collins and Sheena Ethan did now.  And speaking of Tyra, the period show, we had a lot of fun with that.  I think we did about â€“  Was that â€“ that was this week?  I think it was last week.  It was fantastic.  It was just amazing.  A whole show.  Talking about periods for an hour.  Why?  Why do I have to hear about it?  Why? 
[02:34:30]  How did we come to this?  Yeah, how did we come to the point where Tyra is talking with an audience full of these  dolty women about their periods?  They're wearing shirts with, like, red dots on them and â€“  It is â€“ I don't â€“ it's to a point â€“ I don't even know â€“ everyone's like,  when do you think it's going to be the worst?  And I was like, well, just watch Tyra and we'll get there.  I want to see Maury pick up the ball and run with it with that and do a men pre-cum joke show 
[02:35:00]  where it's just men talk about how when you're done with sex and you put your underwear on  and you go to take a whiz after you're done, it kind of comes out like a sprinkler.  Or just a show on â€“  I'm sure that is probably on some cork board or on a posted note that's on a dry mark eraser board.  We'll do it after the â€“ we bring in the primordial dwarves that overeat.  All right, well, save it for sweet. Save it for sweet.  You also, Joel, talk about Courtney and Chloe a lot on your soup. 
[02:35:30]  They now have a spinoff show because, you know, that is how popular â€“ they are a worldwide phenomenon.  Yes.  They are huge internationally.  So we â€“ even though we make so much â€“ we make obviously a lot of fun of them,  but they have become more powerful than Seacrest.  Wow. Come on.  Yeah, I like that.  And they're like, we don't need Kim.  We don't need Kim anymore.  We're going to open up our own shop in Miami, first episode.  Let's go pick Kim up at the airport to promote our new shop in Miami. 
[02:36:00]  It's great.  You â€“ I've noticed you're â€“ this isn't a slap at you or anything,  but you're looking a little more Hollywood.  Thank God.  You're looking a little more â€“ you've done something with your hair, and you look fantastic.  Well, they â€“ I now have a routine â€“ they now cut my hair all the time on the set of Community.  Uh-huh.  And I'm using Ryan â€“ Ryan Seacrest facial cream. 
[02:36:30]  Is that what it is?  Believe me, pick up a jar.  I have a gown.  Where do you get that?  A glory hole?  What?  Nothing.  I didn't say anything.  Nothing, Joel.  You didn't hear nothing.  I'm going to get you in trouble.  Let us do our jokes.  You relax.  You're Hollywood now.  Yes.  Just make believe you didn't hear that.  You can't burn any bridges.  You cross the bridge and smile at the toll guy.  We have to sit there and watch it in flames.  Yeah, we've got to wait for them to rebuild it so we can get to the other side.  Well, thank you for saying that.  I will take that as a compliment.  I'm fully waxed now, so I've collected the hair and I've donated it. 
[02:37:00]  Well, what can you tell us about Community premiering â€“ oh, it's tonight, NBC, 930.  Tonight after the office, so just leave your TV on.  Yeah, I mean, the promos have been pretty funny.  Yeah, I play a DUI lawyer who's a liar and a cheat, and he lied about having a college degree.  He gets thrown out, and they say you have to go get a real degree or you're banned for life.  So he goes to community college thinking it's going to be easy, and he will cheat, and it doesn't work.  And he's in a Spanish study group with a bunch of people he would have never chosen to be with. 
[02:37:30]  Kind of like my family reunion.  And how's Chevy Chase to work with?  He's like Nolan Ryan.  And he might be older than everybody, but he is still very funny.  I don't know if you've seen him in the previews, but he plays this retired guy who's got a moist towelette company.  He was surprisingly funny in the promos, I'll be honest.  Surprisingly.  Because I haven't thought of Chevy Chase being funny in a long time.  I hate to say that.  And then I see you're in the show, so of course it piques my interest.  And then I saw the promos. 
[02:38:00]  I'm like, goddamn, Chevy's fucking funny in this thing.  Yeah, he's really good, and he made up such a huge pile of money in the 80s that he doesn't have to do anything.  Right.  So, yeah, it's so strange being on set with him, because I'm like, I can quote back Fletch to him.  Oh, really?  Big Fletch fan.  I like Fletch very much.  I can quote back Caddyshack to him.  And he's like, okay, I get it.  You've seen them.  Thank you.  You've seen the movie.  Shut up.  Please turn away and walk away from me.  I'm sure he's sick of that by now.  But these are the guys that directed Arrested Development. 
[02:38:30]  Which was a great show.  He loved Arrested Development.  I mean, yeah, they have a great sensibility.  And we got Ken Jeong from The Hangover, the naked Asian guy.  He was also in Role Models.  Let's not forget.  I think Role Models was very underrated.  That movie was fucking funny, man.  When did it come out?  Maybe a little over a year ago, I would guess.  It's worth reading if you haven't seen it yet.  I have not seen it.  He is so funny.  And he plays our Spanish teacher.  He's constantly resenting everyone.  He's like, I know you expect me to teach math. 
[02:39:00]  Or build a wall you can see from space.  Or do something mysterious and ancient.  But I'm a Spanish teacher, you jerks.  So he's great.  Very good.  And then you've got to see the movie coming out tomorrow.  Yeah, The Informant.  Yeah.  What the fuck, Joel?  Save some of this stuff for other people.  It all happens at once, and this weekend's going to be very depressing, because I'll have  nothing to promote.  The Informant looks really fucking funny.  Yeah.  I've seen the trailers for it.  Yeah, Matt Damon.  Really hilarious.  It looks really fucking funny in that one. 
[02:39:30]  And he put on 300 pounds.  Yes, I heard 300 pounds for this role.  It's astonishing.  He wears it very well.  Are you guys good?  We're good.  Yes, we're sitting here in a much smaller studio than when we last met.  Really?  Yeah, they put us over in the Sirius building instead of our little oasis that everybody  forgot about us in.  Instead of being special, we're just one of many now.  That made sense.  I bet.  Now we're just in a fucking factory of studios. 
[02:40:00]  A bunch of just factories here.  Yeah.  Both your voices still have the same velvety fog.  Thank you, sir.  It's still, yes, it's still just, it tickles my ears.  It literally caresses my ears like a lady's tongue.  Well, come and see us, will you?  Yeah, I would love to.  Next time I'm in town, I would love to.  I'll be there for two hours.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'd be good.  We'll goof on stuff. 
[02:40:30]  That'd be great.  If you're still allowed to, Mr. Hollywood.  I know.  It's going to get to the point where it's like, well, you know, you really shouldn't do  this show anymore.  And he'll just be another one of these guys from the soup legacy that has gone on to  movies and stuff.  Can we not hit Tyra so hard?  She's a good friend of mine now.  Yeah, good friend.  You know, you're maybe going to want these people to be on their show.  Yeah, we understand.  We're trying to get Tyra out as a professor on community.  Great.  All right, Joel.  All right, thank you guys.  Thanks a lot, Joel, man.  Joel McKeown, everyone. 
[02:41:00]  You hear the publicist.  Oh, was it?  Did the publicist actually say meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh,  meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh,  right.  Doesn't even understand that there might be a conversation going on.  Yeah, we're talking.  It's just time to her.  We're talking here.  Trying to talk.  What do we got?  The community premieres tonight on NBC at 9.30 p.m.  We're going to take a quick break, and we'll continue with the Wendy Williams thing and some other stuff.  Open, Anthony. 
[02:41:30]  This day in history?  Yeah.  Usually we blow it off.  But this just blows my mind.  Guns N' Roses released Use Your Illusion 1 and 2.  How many years ago would you say it?  That was a huge double album for the band.  Huge.  Hold on.  Use Your Illusion 1 and 2. 
[02:42:00]  I will say 19 years ago.  Why is that?  I have no idea.  I was just picking a number.  18 years ago.  Oh, wow.  18 years ago for Use Your Illusion 1 and 2.  Wow.  That's close.  I almost had it.  That's unbelievable, right?  Off by 1.  Off by 1.  And what about the Obama thing?  The jackass comment?  Well, I know you're not happy about that, but you did say something nice about Obama this morning before the show, 
[02:42:30]  saying that the whole jackass thing, you really believe he did slip.  Yeah, when you see the video, you notice it's not like a stage thing, because I was kind of speculating whether it seemed like maybe he threw it out there knowing that he had the mic on and everything.  Well, we said, you know, they were getting ready for the press conference or whatever they call it down there, the briefing.  And everyone's there with their cameras and they're recording devices, and you've got to assume they're already rolling tape.  Yeah.  He's kind of sitting there. 
[02:43:00]  They're strapping on his little mic.  And he kind of threw out that line that Kanye was a jackass.  Yeah.  And right after it, you see it on the video, right after, he kind of goes like, oh, like he thinks, oh, shit, maybe I shouldn't have said that.  And then he looks at the press and he's kind of like, hey, guys, you know, cut the president some slack.  Did he do an ixnay?  Yeah, he kind of did that finger by your throat thing, like, hey, cut that out.  Don't do that.  But, of course, it made the whole internet and everything else. 
[02:43:30]  I kind of like it.  It's a real moment.  I like these real moments.  And that's what I thought.  It's like, for how much I don't like him, his policies and stuff, that was kind of a real, like, he's a jackass.  Kind of a, he's not a dumb guy either.  He learned, I think, from jumping on his friend's side.  Did I say that already?  Or was I just thinking it?  But he learned.  He didn't take Patterson's bait on the racial stuff.  And he didn't take Carter's bait recently.  So he's kind of, he's smart.  He learned from that one mistake he made.  But also, a little payback, because didn't Kanye say some bad things about Obama? 
[02:44:00]  Did he?  Did he?  I don't know.  Who the hell knows?  He's an idiot.  Didn't Kanye, was he the one who said that Obama doesn't like black people?  No, he said that about Bush.  Oh, Bush.  Oh, Bush didn't like black people.  That's different.  Wow, I'm off a little bit.  Obama and Bush are a little different.  I'm off a little bit on that one, huh?  Just a tad.  Oh, my God.  But he's out humiliating for Kanye.  That's why I believe his apology.  That's humiliating.  Oh, yeah, he definitely meant it.  The first black president, and then you hear he just called you a jackass, like a dismissive.  I know.  And everybody heard it.  Everyone knows it. 
[02:44:30]  It's not like he said it in private.  That is embarrassing.  Not as embarrassing as what just played on our channel, according to The Onion in Madison, Wisconsin.  What?  What?  He writes, there's big words in here, Ed.  I might need your help.  Opie, did you know the most common cause of blindness in the elderly is age-related wet macular degeneration?  Yeah, I've heard that commercial.  Yeah, that spot works for your demo. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Why is that playing on our commercial?  I don't know.  Why is that on our channel?  Why?  We have plenty of stuff we can play for the listeners when we have to take a break.  I bet when they get these commercials, they just go, we're going to run them on every channel.  We're just going to put them on every single channel.  Well, that don't make sense.  Yeah, well, hey, if you've got that runny eye macular degeneration, if you look like one of those fucking dogs in the goddamn late-night commercials. 
[02:45:30]  With the dead eye.  I hate the dead eye.  It's so creepy.  Dead eye fucking cat.  Transparent dead eye.  Fucking betrays it.  Cat with fucking conjunctivitis.  Yeah.  Well, that's kind of lazy.  What?  Just putting that on our channel?  No, the eye.  Oh, the eye.  Yeah, fix your eye, stupid cat.  Oh, yeah, it's lazy.  I mean, you should be able to, like, pick and choose.  You know, that's just wasting time.  Yeah, it kind of is.  We could do a better job with that.  We don't need to just waste time. 
[02:46:00]  Regular radio does that.  We could have better things that fit a little more.  Yeah, absolutely.  And if you don't have enough stuff, then, you know, hand it over to us and we'll come back sooner.  We'll throw a little.  No, we won't.  We're not eating or shitting.  We'll throw just another little quick funny bit in there.  That, too.  You want to do more Wendy Williams?  Wendy Williams.  He's the monster.  The other thing about Obama is Sam makes his way down the hall again.  Uh-oh.  Don't bring it up.  Come on.  White House says Obama doesn't think he's being criticized because of his race, like Jimmy Carr suggests.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, they'll always say that. 
[02:46:30]  They've said it from the beginning.  I was going to say, do you think Obama really believes that?  But it's obviously the right thing for him to say in that situation.  But you think he really believes that?  I think he absolutely believes it.  I think he sees some of this protesting going on in middle America and thinks it's based on race.  And if that wife of his gets a hold of his ear and starts blathering her nonsense into it, of course he's going to start believing it.  Wait.  Because I know damn well she does.  Wait.  You kind of did a â€“ you're making complete sense, but you just twisted my question.  Did I?  Yep.  Does he believe that it â€“ all right. 
[02:47:00]  Wait.  White House says Obama doesn't think he's being criticized because of his race.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought it says â€“ does think.  So I said, do you think he really believes that?  Oh, no.  And you said I absolutely believe that, but then you answered it like, no, I don't believe he believes that.  I think he believes that his presidency is being affected by his race.  I do think he believes that.  Yeah.  So do I.  I think he knows.  But he said the opposite.  I think he does believe that. 
[02:47:30]  And, you know, for â€“ a lot of people are saying that he's being picked on for his association with people, with that idiot that he had as the green czar.  And now they're completely separating themselves from that acorn organization that just turns out to be â€“ wow, are they a bunch of naughty people.  I know.  Now all of a sudden I'm supporting them.  Yeah.  Jimmy thinks they're great.  They're giving money to fucking prostitution rings and â€“ that are bringing underage girls from South America. 
[02:48:00]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Fantastic.  So Obama doesn't believe.  Mainstream media is not killing them.  But we think he really does believe.  Yeah.  I believe he believes.  Especially if, like I said, his wife gets a hold of him.  When she said that frigging line during the campaign where it's the first time I felt proud to be an American, I think, shut the fuck up.  That â€“ some of those lines don't leave â€“ they don't leave me.  Yeah, that line bothered me a lot, too.  That line bothered me.  It's like, what, you haven't been proud of America until what? 
[02:48:30]  America's done some great things.  Your husband gets elected or wins the nomination or whatever.  It's like, yeah, how about you be proud of America because you're an American and not a black American?  Can we just do that for a minute?  Apparently not.  I agree with you on that one.  Oh.  I absolutely agree with you on that one.  Oh, agree with the racist.  Let's get into something a little â€“  I'm such a racist.  People call me racist every day.  They call me racist.  So I embrace-ist it. 
[02:49:00]  Let's get back into something that's a little more fun.  Fun?  Will you just leave the fucking chickens alone?  What's with the chickens?  Enough with the chickens.  Leave the fucking chickens alone.  Oh, these chicken Americans.  Police investigating UK supermarket a guy that they're calling Chicken Liquor.  Police in the UK are investigating â€“  What is he doing?  Hidden camera footage that shows a supermarket worker licking fresh chickens before putting 
[02:49:30]  them back on store shelves.  Oh, yeah.  And they just want to know why the fuck is this guy doing this?  That sounds like a nervous habit or like a tick.  A tick?  No, no, no.  Like doing something like turning the knob.  Like he probably licked one.  They have to lick the chicken?  Like he probably likes the way it feels on his tongue.  It's probably a weird thing with a feel.  You know what he does though?  It's not a feel thing.  He fucking takes the chicken legs, right?  And he grabs them by the chicken feet and he pulls the legs up and then he licks the  chicken's asshole.  He just slowly titillatingly licks the chicken's asshole and then right up to the chicken clit. 
[02:50:00]  And then he pushes the legs back and then he grabs the bottom of the chicken's ass and  slowly slides up and then starts fucking, slow fucking, but deep fucking the chicken.  And the chicken's going,  Yes!  You ever eat chicken ass?  Who hasn't?  It's so funny because their little feet kick back at you, but they're not strong.  Chicken legs are very weak.  They're very weak-legged animal. 
[02:50:30]  Have you ever ate chicken ass?  It was a delicacy in the Hughes household.  Was it?  We used to fight over the chicken ass.  It's very, uh...  A delicacy.  It was a delicacy in the Hughes household.  That and lima beans.  I like to...  We fought over lima beans.  I like to finger the ass of a chicken while screaming political points at it.  You know how stupid you'd look doing that?  Just railing political points loudly?  I don't know what's the worst.  Fucking the chicken or, uh, yelling political points at it. 
[02:51:00]  The chicken would be so confused.  Like, why is this guy doing this?  Like, this is uncomfortable and I don't understand his language.  Uh...  And I'm conservative.  Yes.  Well, the chicken licker story gets better.  So you got a guy licking fresh chickens before putting them back.  On store shelves.  Yes.  The cell phone footage also shows the man wreaking havoc in the aisles of this particular store.  During his night shifts.  This is what this guy does.  Besides, uh, licking the fresh chickens.  Mm-hmm.  He's urinating in a bin in the men's room. 
[02:51:30]  He's playing cricket with food items.  He's smashing eggs and setting off fire extinguishers.  How do you keep your job?  He's a madman.  How the fuck do you keep your job?  He's a madman.  He works at this...  He's crazy.  He is crazy.  The man who called himself Adil Ayyab is dressed in the supermarket chain's distinctive green uniform as he laughs and gloats about his behavior at a store in England.  The workers also observed wrecking furniture in a staff room, slashing the coats of colleagues, and filming firefighters responding to a false alarm. 
[02:52:00]  And he continues to keep his job.  How does he keep his job?  He probably is very efficient.  Yeah.  Like, imagine after all that, he still does a great job.  It's the best.  He's the best guy for the job.  But he just has these little idiosyncrasies.  Do you know how good you have to be to survive licking the food products?  Yeah.  And then putting it back.  False alarms.  Yeah.  This guy who worked for the company from 2005 to last year is also spotted returning to the store this year wearing a hoodie and stamping his feet on fresh, ready-to-cooked chickens in the freezer. 
[02:52:30]  He does not enjoy the chicken.  What the fuck did the chicken do to him?  He does not appreciate the chicken enough.  You don't just lick it and put it back.  He also rips.  You leave the chicken frustrated.  And why didn't he catch some, like, horrendous food poisoning from, you can't lick.  Oh, salmonella?  You can't lick fresh chicken without something coming out of your hiney, man.  Really?  Oh.  Every time?  Dude.  Yes.  He also rips open the plastic wrapping around one of the chickens, pokes his fingers in the flesh, and licks the breast before returning the bird to the shelf. 
[02:53:00]  Flicks the breast.  This guy sucks.  So, there you go.  And I just got an email from Stuntbrain.  Stuntbrain thinks Ernie Anastas definitely said fucking.  Of course he did.  He did.  I want to hear that again because it relates to the chicken story.  I want to play this one more time in case you missed it earlier.  Ernie Anastas makes what sounds like a major slip-up on Fox 5 News here in New York.  Yeah, this is a good one.  We've listened to this a couple times, and they're trying to say he said chicken. 
[02:53:30]  What did he say?  Chicken plucker.  Keep plucking that chicken plucker, right.  Yeah, keep plucking that chicken.  But there's no p-l sound.  It's f-uh.  Wow.  Things don't want to work today.  Not queuing up?  It's so weird.  This thing doesn't want to work today.  Come on.  Talk among yourselves.  Oh, you're cleaning it off?  That always works.  It does.  Does it?  Yes, watch.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm Fox 5 Sky Guardian, and then check that Saturday to make your weekend plans. 
[02:54:00]  Takes a tough man to make a tender forecast, Nick.  I guess that's me.  Keep plucking that chicken.  Okay, I'll do that.  All right.  When we continue.  And he has no idea that he just said keep fucking that chicken.  He might have wanted to say keep plucking that chicken or keep something that chicken, and it came out fucking.  Right.  Like, he just, he did say fucking.  Right.  What are they saying about it?  Is he having to apologize? 
[02:54:30]  Is anyone outraged?  Well, the video's going to do very well today, Anthony.  Very well.  Oh, yes.  And the female newsreader, her eyes get really wide.  Like, oh, my God.  Did she go, oh, shit, you didn't say fucking?  No, she's nervous.  Like, God, please don't fire me, because I just happen to be here at the same time.  Yeah, collateral damage these days.  Right, right.  It happens, you know, a producer fucks something up, and everyone has to go, because something got played.  This guy is very mad at us.  Adam, what's the problem, Adam?  What's the matter, Adam?  Hey, I listen to you guys every day, and most of the time I don't agree with you politically, 
[02:55:00]  but I just wish you were a little bit more, like, independent-minded and fair,  because I know you're independent-minded guys, but lately it's just been,  you've just been tools of the Drudge Report and Fox News.  Oh.  And I don't know if, Anthony, you're just trying to get more appearances on Hannity.  Yeah.  It's like every day you just read only the Drudge Report, watch only Fox News,  and come on and talk about their political stories.  Yeah.  But it's not, it's just, it's unlike you guys, and it's more and more every day. 
[02:55:30]  Every day.  I do only read two websites, it's Drudge and Fox News, and I just get my opinions from those sites.  I don't read anything about Obama's platform, about health care reform, about how this multilateral plan has come up  and how a lot of people still aren't supporting it, about the public option, whether it should be involved in the health care reform or not.  I don't read anything about any of that and then make my own judgments and opinions based on how it's going to affect me directly, 
[02:56:00]  and then discuss it on the air, and because you don't like it, I'm just a tool of Fox News.  You're right.  I just read two sites, and then I'm done.  Right.  If you really go back and listen to yourself and look at all sides of the story.  I do it every day.  It's wonderful.  My voice is amazing.  You give half the story.  Half the story would sound like, I think Obama, and then it would stop.  Maybe we agree on some stuff, just like you agree with some of the liberal agenda, I'm sure. 
[02:56:30]  I'm not saying it makes you a liberal tool, which I think you are, but I'm not saying it.  Dude, don't you understand I have a position based on my own personal experiences, my own personal wants?  But don't you see what their agenda is?  I mean, you have the mind to be able to look through their bullshit. 
[02:57:00]  Their bullshit.  Who's there?  What about CBS, NBC, MSNBC, ABC?  Hold on, hold on.  What about all the other networks besides Fox?  You don't think that's a liberal agenda?  You don't think them giving Obama a special to talk about his health care reform didn't have anything to do with Obama inviting only ABC into the White House?  No, I think that's ridiculous.  I think that's a total conspiracy.  He doesn't give this shit about whether or not only one network is giving him a health care hour. 
[02:57:30]  Did that seal the deal for him?  No, because people don't want it.  That's what's not sealing it for him.  The reason is because people don't want it.  That's why it's not sealing the deal for him.  And he doesn't accept the fact, like you, everyone that doesn't agree with his policy, especially on health care, is either a racist or a tool for Fox News or an ultra right-wing conservative like Hannity or Limbaugh or anybody else.  It's not true.  The truth is I don't like his fucking platform, especially on health care and on things that tax the cunt out of me. 
[02:58:00]  But don't you see this bullshit about Van Jones and about Acorn with some, like, stupid Acorn chapter in California did?  Dude, dude, dude, dude, Acorn, how could those possibly be related to health care reform, which is talking about addressing the health care industry?  You know how it's related?  An issue that's been debated for 40 fucking years.  You know how it's debated?  Three people in California from Acorn.  Three people.  First of all, it's three people in California, and then it's a few people in Jersey. 
[02:58:30]  It seems to be every one of these Acorn offices have fucking shysters in there that are fleecing the taxpayers for their special interest group that doesn't do anything helpful for this country and gets a shitload of our tax dollars.  That's why.  And as far as Van Jonesâ€”hold on, hold on, I let you talk.  And as far as Van Jones goes, it shows that Obama might have questionable abilities in appointing people without knowing where their past lies, where their agenda lies. 
[02:59:00]  He made him the Greens czar, and he turned out to be a fucking atrocity, a self-proclaimed communist.  You want that?  You want that inâ€”to have the president's ear?  You want that guy advising the president?  To be honest with you, if he's the best person at creating green jobsâ€”  He's not.  He's not.  Oh, really?  You know better.  Okay, okay, no, no, I'll let you continue on that, Tack. 
[02:59:30]  I'm sorry.  If he's the best guy for the job, okay, then it's okay that he's a self-proclaimed communist.  He was a revolutionary activist, radical in his youth, and that's okay.  So what about David Duke?  What if fucking David Duke, the former grand dragon of the KKK, who then ran for legitimate office and was just creamed by liberals and African-Americans and the Jews about his past?  Hold on.  And he had some very good ideas about how he would run things if he won his election bid back in the, I believe, 90s. 
[03:00:00]  Um, you think that's okay if he was the best guy for the job, put in a former Klan leader?  Comparing someoneâ€”  Hey, no!  Answer the fucking question!  Yes or no?  If he's the best guy for the job, do you put in a former Klan leader?  No.  Why?  Because he wouldn't be able to do the job fairly if he hates 30% of the country.  Well, Van Jonesâ€”Van Jones can't because he hates fucking 80% of the country. 
[03:00:30]  He's a racistâ€”he's a racist fucking black radical.  That's where he came from.  It's fucking documented.  You don't even know the guy.  Yes, I do!  Oh, right.  I did no fucking research on him.  I don't know him personally.  I never had him over my fucking house.  Iâ€”but I knowâ€”  But don't you recognize that there are deeper levels to people?  Not just what you hear on one news network?  Yeah, again, one news network. 
[03:01:00]  I'm soâ€”I'm so fucking uneducated on Obama and Van Jones and Acorn because I don't agree with them.  So which means I'm uneducated on them instead ofâ€”instead of basing my opinionâ€”no, you are.  You're saying I read two fucking websites and I'm a tool of Fox News.  And by the way, the only reason you only hear it on one network, dude, and you gotta acknowledge this,  the mainstream media is not covering it.  They didn't cover Van Jones, a guy in a policymaking position, the way they covered Don Imus.  Right.  Thank you.  He's notâ€”he's in a position to help create green jobs. 
[03:01:30]  Bro, just explain that.  You're exaggerating the issue.  No, no, dude, justâ€”hold on.  He's in a position of power.  A presidential appointee!  And he was not scrutinized by the media for racial comments the way Don Imus was for an inappropriate joke.  You can't deny that.  The mainstream media did not cover that.  You cannot deny that.  Yeah.  I agree with you.  Well, then don't sit here and ask Anthony, who just ran circles around you, honestly,  not because you're saying that he gets all his opinions from Fox and blah, blah, blah, 
[03:02:00]  but you, for some reason, are completely in denial of the complete bias.  And we can say to you, why the hell do you watch those networks when they're spoon-feeding you an opinion?  Come on, man.  I watch Fox News every day.  I watch O'Reilly.  I watch stuff on Hannity and stuff on Glenn Beck.  I watch all of the networks when I get a chance.  So then why can't Anthony do that and just be forming that opinion?  You guys don't watch it every day.  I don't watch any of them.  I don't watch O'Reilly.  I don't watch Hannity.  I don't watch Glenn Beck.  I watch nobody.  Listen, the point is that Imus was unfairly criticized. 
[03:02:30]  I listened to Imus every morning when he was on.  I love Imus.  Dude, I said media coverage.  Media coverage.  I said media coverage.  Media coverage.  Media coverage does not have a liberal bias or a conservative bias.  Oh, yes, itâ€”really?  Holy shit.  Let me just finish.  Let me just finish.  It doesn't have that bias because they decide, oh, because most of us are conservative or  most of us are liberal, we're going to do this.  They do this to try to attract viewers.  That's why Fox News is conservative.  But let me explain something to you. 
[03:03:00]  They found a big audience that can't find that elsewhere.  Well, there's a reason because the rest of the networks are biased.  Here's a little statistic that came up, and I'm not sure the exact numbers, but I'll round  them off.  Fox News covered the Green Czar story I think about 110 times, and it was brought up on CBS  News twice.  Now, this is a storyâ€”  Hold on. 
[03:03:30]  Hold on.  Did you read any positive articles about Van Jones or any of his personal writings, or  did you base it entirely on articles that were critical of him?  Because I've read articles that were supportive of him.  Now, I don't think that he should be in the position that he was.  Oh, okay.  So that's all I'm saying.  And why don't you thinkâ€”  My point is that it's not that big of a deal, though.  Why don't you think he should beâ€”he should have been in that position, then?  What's your opinion on why he shouldn't have had that job?  Because he didn't know when to keep his mouth shut.  He couldn'tâ€”  And that's it.  Not what he was saying or thinking, but the fact that he said it? 
[03:04:00]  Is that what you're saying?  So if he didn'tâ€”if he still thought these things, but didn't say them, then that would  have been cool.  It probably would have kept his job.  Well, obviously he would have kept his job, but then he still would have been a former  black radical, a self-proclaimed communist, and had the ear of the president of the United  States who appointed this man.  He was not a self-proclaimed communist.  He absolutely was.  No, he was not.  Then you didn't read his earlier writings, did you? 
[03:04:30]  You didn't read his earlier fucking writings, did you?  Do you know no one that's changed politically?  Are we not allowed to change politically?  Ah, okay.  So he changed.  Robert Byrne at one point was a segregationist.  Now he's a Democrat in the Senate.  Like, people changed.  By the way, David Duke changed.  And he was a former member, a leader of the KKK.  But again, you wouldn't have him in a position of power because he couldn't change?  I think that that's a little bit of an extremeâ€”  Oh, is it?  Is it?  I thinkâ€”I think Van Jones is a little bit of an extreme to have as a man that has the 
[03:05:00]  ear of the president that was appointed, by the way, appointed by the president, who  then distanced himself knowing that he can't get involved with that because it's a hot  topic?  I think my point, Anthony, is not that I disagree with you about the Van Jones issue because  I don't think that we disagree much.  The point is that every day your political issues are based on the top headlines of Drudge  and Fox News, and they prioritize their issues based on their very right-wing agenda to attract 
[03:05:30]  that right-wing audience, just like MSNBC does with their liberal audience.  They prioritize their issues, and you guys are just bringing the same agenda that they  have to a different audience.  But here's what you're doing.  Here's what you're doing.  You say you watch Fox News, but you also watch MSNBC.  I do the same thing.  I watch Fox News, and I watch MSNBC.  I'm formulating my opinions based on my own personal experiences. 
[03:06:00]  You are doing the same.  We don't agree.  You are more liberal.  I am more conservative.  That doesn't make me wrong or a puppet or a tool or a racist.  It means we don't agree.  Even though we're getting the same information, I'm formulating it differently because of  who I am and my lifestyle, my upbringing, everything comes into play.  You've done the same thing.  We don't agree on our points, but that doesn't make me wrong or a tool or a racist.  I think it makes you a tool because I turn on your show. 
[03:06:30]  Well, you're a tool of the left.  You're a tool of the fucking left, then.  I'll just be like you.  I'm not even going to try to be logical anymore like I just was trying to be.  You're a tool for the left.  You're a fucking bedwetting liberal motherfucker that loves tax and spend Democrats.  There.  Because you only watch MSNBC and the New York Times.  There.  There.  I just matched you.  Look, when Dr. Aaron Carroll was on your show, you brought nothing to the table.  That's E-Rock. 
[03:07:00]  You brought nothing to the table.  He totally dominated you in that debate.  No, I don't think you did.  But you didn't have enough knowledge.  At that time?  All you did was bring in statistics that you've heard from the right-wing extreme agenda against  the health care reform.  Let me tell you.  You totally lost the debate.  If at the time.  You truly believe that you're bringing in all different types of news sources, that you're  really addressing the topics that are addressed by liberal news sources just as much as you 
[03:07:30]  are right-leaning news sources.  Your whole show.  Yeah.  Why do you think Hannity is such a fan of yours?  Because you go and spew the next morning exactly what he did the night before.  No, because there are certain things we agree on.  You're just adding to his audience.  It's just an entire right-wing campaign that you guys are just now a part of.  Anthony has just ruined you in this argument, dude.  Unbelievable.  And you're still saying the same thing.  He was logical with you.  He explained how he forms his opinion.  He said something about Van Jones being a communist that you obviously didn't know. 
[03:08:00]  And it's like you're still insisting on the same â€“ this is, to me, the arrogance of  the left.  Yes.  If you guys can't believe that your opinions or ideologies are being challenged on their  merits, you always have to find another reason.  Like this is why they're saying â€“ like dumb Jimmy Carter saying Obama is being challenged  because of race.  Like he can't comprehend â€“  Why is that dumb?  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'll tell you why.  Because the arguments I've heard people make are not about how Obama's treating blacks  or being too black. 
[03:08:30]  It's about health care and taxes.  The same things they would attack Hillary Clinton.  That's about what Jimmy Carter brought up.  Jimmy Carter is talking â€“  You didn't read anything about it.  Jimmy Carter â€“  Don't, don't, don't, don't.  Jimmy â€“ you're not going to interrupt me, fuck.  You got to talk.  You're not just going to interrupt me.  I heard what Jimmy Carter said.  He said that he believed the attacks are because it's a black man in the White House.  And I'm saying the main things people attack Obama on are health care and taxes.  And they are.  That's all he said, actually.  And he did say that.  He said the way that he was being attacked was racist. 
[03:09:00]  The fact that people were being so disrespectful.  And in the first three months comparing the guy to voodoo kings and Hitler and the most extreme â€“  They compared Bush to Hitler.  Look, the bottom line is this.  They compared Bush to Hitler after he went to two wars.  Jimmy Carter.  Jimmy Carter.  Jimmy Carter.  You're totally wrong.  No, I'm not totally wrong.  And that's why the fuck you think Obama backed away from it, you jackass.  The White House walked away from it.  The White House walked away from fucking David Patterson's nonsensical things. 
[03:09:30]  The whole transcript, Robert Gibbs said that he believes that only the majority of the criticism coming toward Obama is not based on race.  So he did recognize that some of it is racist in the nation.  Obama did not think â€“ Obama does â€“ Obama does not â€“ I heard Jimmy Carter say it.  I watched his mouth move.  And I formed an opinion.  And Jimmy Carter has always said shit about sitting presidents.  He annoys people when he talks.  It's what he does.  That's what he does.  But Hillary Clinton would be getting killed on the same things. 
[03:10:00]  And the media â€“ doesn't this strike you as odd?  The mainstream media paints these guys, the protesters, the â€“ what do they call it?  The tea parties?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, the tea baggers.  Why aren't they so fucking clib about ever â€“ like the Million Man March or about Code Pink or about any fucking left-leaning organization that protests?  Why is it only a bunch of white people?  The leader of the tea party movement was on CNN the other day.  There is no leader of the tea party movement.  Yes, there is. 
[03:10:30]  You know something?  Hold on.  Wake up.  When people go to these town hall meetings â€“  Let me finish my point about the guy, one of the leaders of the tea party movement.  Go ahead.  The tea â€“ he's the leader of a group called the Tea Party Express, which brings tea parties across the country.  He, on his blog, called Obama a racist Indonesian Muslim thug.  That's what he called him on his blog, which I think is rooted in a lot of racism.  Oh, and what about left â€“ what about left-leaning stuff with Bush? 
[03:11:00]  On CNN representing the tea parties that I think that you can make a fair â€“ you can make a fair conclusion that some of the criticism is based on his race or the way that he's being criticized is based on his race.  That's not the â€“ dude, the way he's being criticized, he's being handled with kid gloves.  Exactly.  One guy blurted out something stupid, which he shouldn't have done just because it does disrespect the fact that the president is talking.  But Jimmy Carter was not just talking about that one guy.  He said that he thinks a lot of the criticism coming at Obama is because he is a black man and we have trouble with a black man. 
[03:11:30]  And I'm telling you, the conversations I have and the criticism I hear, it really is financial.  And when you hear the ridicule that these average citizens get at these town hall meetings by the mainstream media, they're protesting taxes.  They're not saying Obama's doing too much for blacks.  They're not even â€“ it's about taxes going up and health care.  When you see over 100,000 people on the mall carrying signs and old flags that say, 
[03:12:00]  don't tread on me and no taxation, stop the tax and spend, there's nothing racist on these signs.  On those signs, no, but on some of them there is.  Well, then explain why the mainstream media ridicules these people protesting higher taxes.  Explain what?  Why the mainstream media ridicules these people in a way that they have never ridiculed truly crazy fucking groups.  They don't ridicule PETA when they paint themselves in red paint and act like they're fucking animal blood. 
[03:12:30]  They don't ridicule Code Pink.  They don't ridicule any of these fucking groups.  The Rainbow Coalition.  These average citizens, these average citizens who don't want their taxes going up in town hall meetings  and don't want their health care completely taken over in a way that they don't feel is appropriate,  are being ridiculed by the mainstream media.  I think a lot of times the ridicule is coming from their lack of knowledge.  When you look at a lot of the video of the town halls, the questions they ask, the signs they hold up are â€“ 
[03:13:00]  and it's unfair for me to just say that.  So why don't you just say it's the media â€“ why don't you just say â€“  There's a lot of misinformation and people are being taken advantage of.  Do you see the arrogance?  Dude, listen to your liberal arrogance.  The people are being â€“ how about those people have valid points?  And maybe, maybe the left has bias too.  Maybe the media is biased in a way that you accuse Fox â€“ and you're accurate.  You're sitting there saying, you're right, we're uneducated.  What an arrogant, dope. 
[03:13:30]  Anyone who has the same opinion as you is right.  Anyone who doesn't is uneducated or being led by the nose or being brainwashed.  I didn't say that.  No, no, you're â€“  You are saying that.  No, you're not saying that verbatim, but your whole fucking point has been that you're right  and your research that you have done has brought you down the road to rightness.  Yeah.  And my research, based on what I have read, has brought me down the road to being a puppet for the right.  He's right, dude. 
[03:14:00]  Is that it?  You're coming off as so fucking arrogant.  It is.  The arrogance is fucking staggering.  And it's every â€“ to me that you â€“  Why are you calling me arrogant?  How does that play a role in â€“  Because you're saying you're right, I'm wrong, based on opinions we have formulated independently.  I haven't brought up one policy platform for you to even know whether or not â€“  You just said the mainstream â€“  Yes, you have.  Liberal or conservative.  Of course you can.  You just said the mainstream media.  When I said, why are they ridiculing these people?  Instead of saying, you know what, maybe the mainstream media does have a little bit of bias 
[03:14:30]  and they're being protective about the president,  you say, well, it's because the people are ill-informed.  It's because â€“ it's like the correct intellectually elite media is making an informed decision  about the dumb Americans instead of realizing that the media might have a bias the way Fox does.  Look at the facts, Jimmy.  Yes, I am looking at the facts.  Can you answer that question?  Answer â€“ no, no, not â€“ no.  Answer â€“ dude.  I'm answering your question.  All right, okay.  I'm giving you evidence.  Okay.  35% of Fox News viewers still believe that Iraq had something to do with 9-11. 
[03:15:00]  Why is that?  I don't know.  Because they propagate the stories to make you still â€“  I honestly â€“  Ignore that.  I don't know that that's true that you're â€“ because you say it doesn't make it true.  I'm not saying you're wrong, but I can't answer that because I think it's a ridiculous  thing for anybody to believe.  You know, there's always going to be people that will believe that.  Just like â€“ I'd love to know the percentage of people that think the government had something  to do with 9-11.  How about that one?  Do you, by the way?  Do you think it's 35%? 
[03:15:30]  35%?  No.  I don't think it's that high, no.  But there's a percentage of people that do think that.  Sure.  So they're idiots.  Well, you know something?  Are they idiots?  Are they?  Yes.  You know, maybe you just â€“ maybe you haven't read what they read, man.  You know, maybe you just don't know the fucking facts.  You're one of the gatekeepers.  We're a truther, man.  You don't understand â€“ do you understand what I'm doing?  You're attacking me for something that I â€“  Exactly.  Yeah, you're attacking me for something that I didn't even say.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  He's implying that you have the same arrogant attitude. 
[03:16:00]  And, dude, Anthony's right.  I listened to the way you defended.  Instead of acknowledging that the mainstream media also has a bias, you just refuse to acknowledge that.  You refuse to acknowledge that the left also has an agenda.  But they do have a liberal bias because they intend to attract â€“ because they intend to attract viewers, and that's how they get viewers.  They don't care.  That's not what you said.  Yeah, I said that.  You said that they mock â€“ whoa, whoa.  You said that they mock these protesters because the protesters are stupid, not because the liberal bias is what's permeating the media. 
[03:16:30]  A lot of times the media, especially mainstream media â€“ I'm talking about some of the network news aside from Fox, of course â€“ are doing their news and leaning left because a lot of the people in charge are left-leaning personally.  So they don't â€“ they're taking their personal thoughts and ideologies and putting that spin into the news. 
[03:17:00]  Now, whether it's happening on Fox also, sure.  Fox is very right-leaning.  And the people that are in charge, Rupert Murdoch and whatnot, they are putting a right-wing spin on it.  But like I said, when you look at the information and you're educated, you form your own opinion.  Yours is different than mine.  It doesn't mean it's right or wrong.  For my interests, it's wrong.  It's costing me a lot of money, and it doesn't jibe with what I think about things like the Second Amendment, the First Amendment, taxation. 
[03:17:30]  For you, it doesn't jibe with other things, with Fox News that puts on that.  It's a right-wing organization that is trying to bring down the president.  But you know something?  I'm not saying you're wrong.  I'm saying you're a lefty.  Just like I lean right, you lean left.  We don't agree with each other.  But I'm not saying I'm right and you're wrong, but you're telling me I'm wrong.  What I was suggesting from the beginning was that not that your opinions were wrong. 
[03:18:00]  I never once said that I disagreed with any of your opinions.  Yes, you did.  I disagreed with the way in which you presented the headlines of the day, that we never get information about Blackwater and cool stories like that, how they send covert ops and how we're paying mercenaries over there.  Yeah, yeah.  Corruption that-  We were.  Blackwater hasn't been over there in probably over a year, dude.  They were thrown the fuck out.  Yeah, they were thrown the fuck out. 
[03:18:30]  I understand.  They were thrown the fuck out of Iraq.  Boy, you've got to really fuck up to get thrown out of Iraq.  And does it strike you as odd?  That inappropriate cartoon was covered 24 hours by the mainstream media and Van Jones, his comments were not being aired.  And this is a guy who is an aide to the president, who is truly in a position of power in this country. 
[03:19:00]  Doesn't it strike you as odd the way one thing is harped on and one thing is not?  Can't you understand that?  Yes.  Then why are you calling saying that Anthony or anybody on the show gets their ideas from Fox when I also see what the mainstream media reports and doesn't report?  And I see what-  Why do you come to that conclusion instead of realizing that maybe we see the same things you do and just talk about this?  Because I listen to your show every day. 
[03:19:30]  Thanks.  And I know the things that you guys talk about.  And I look at Drudge Report, I look at Fox News, I watch Fox News, and it's the same exact headlines in almost like the same exact order.  Do you know, dude, I honestly, God, never watch Fox.  I really don't.  I mean, I read Drudge because-  You're not deciding on the agenda of the show all the time, Jimmy.  I mean, the-  Dude, I'm telling you, you know what, they're called top stories, and we'll do the most important top stories first.  So if you see them in order on Drudge, perhaps- 
[03:20:00]  They have top stories everywhere.  Hold on, we talked-  Anthony is holding us all hostage with his agenda.  Yes, that's what I do.  For real, man.  It's unbelievable.  Hey, dude, do we talk-  Lopey, I thought I had you there.  I thought, like, I had-  I gotta be honest with you, Adam.  I can't be bothered with this stuff whatsoever.  I know that's so lame to say, but I can't be bothered because these arguments will go on forever, and nothing will ever be accomplished.  Anthony believes in what he believes, and that's fine, and you believe in what you believe in, and that's fine. 
[03:20:30]  No, it's stupid.  But to try to get each side to, like, come to the middle, it's just never going to happen.  Hey, dude, I just can't argue this shit anymore.  Let's take a-  I'm going to leave you guys alone, but the last thing I'll say is that, look, you guys are-  Help me.  Anthony is holding me hostage.  You've got what you want.  All I'm saying is-  Just turn me into a conservative.  You know, how important is it to you to be taxed more compared to how important it is for someone that doesn't have health care to get health care? 
[03:21:00]  For my personal life, I believe I don't want to be taxed for a 15% of this country that does not have health care, and the 85% that does, and the 75% that does, and is happy with it.  I don't think it's that pressing of a fucking issue, to tell you the truth.  And fucking Anthony turned me around on that whole goddamn thing.  Like, I was all about Obama change, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then I realized, wait a minute, more money coming out of our fucking pockets. 
[03:21:30]  Find the money somewhere else and leave us the fuck alone.  $900 billion?  Leave us the fuck alone, and I would be rah-rah, yes, health care for everybody, but enough with taking the money out of our pockets.  I'm pretty fiscally conservative myself.  Yeah.  I am.  But I believe that we should, if we're spending $900 billion, I'd rather spend it on health care for this country than out of our country.  All right, that's your preference.  All right, but as long as that doesn't mean more tax money coming from us.  But it's fine, it's somewhere else.  There's never an argument from the right side about how much money the Iraq war, like the American war. 
[03:22:00]  I fucking do that.  Oh my God, we've talked about that.  We've fucking talked about what a disgrace that is.  Selective listening, selective listening.  How many times?  I'm talking about you guys.  I know, but how many, all right.  Wait, you're not talking about us, but you said that we get everything from Fox and Drugs.  Yeah, exactly.  And it said that we have discussed that.  Let me talk about another thing that I've said.  I think if we're going to have a universal health care, it shouldn't be taken from taxpayers. 
[03:22:30]  I think there's enough fucking improprieties going on in the health care system that can be revamped without socialized medicine.  I think affordable private insurance can be made if you cut the waste and bullshit that's going on in the medical field.  That's what I've always said.  I'm not saying I'm against people having fucking medical care.  I'm saying I'm against it coming out of the taxpayers' dollars, especially the upper echelon, which, by the way, is just the middle class in this country. 
[03:23:00]  Let's not bullshit ourselves and say that the money that is coming out of taxes is going to be just the upper echelon of this country.  And that $900 billion, I know, oh, boy, this is a Fox News exclusive.  It's not going to be $900 million.  Any government program estimate has never, ever stayed within the boundaries that were set before the bill was even passed.  Anthony, if your show was around when Social Security was being debated, when Medicaid was being debated, when welfare was being debated, when Medicaid was being debated, you would be against all of those things. 
[03:23:30]  Maybe I would.  But the fact is that all of them have been instated, and you're still a rich motherfucker.  And this is going to happen.  I'm not as rich as I was.  If health reform happens right now, in 20 years, you're still going to be sitting in a jacuzzi three times as big.  Maybe, maybe not.  Maybe, maybe.  You're going to have a happy, beautiful, rich life.  Maybe, maybe not.  And there's people out there that can't afford to pay. 
[03:24:00]  It's not my fucking job to make them better.  This is America.  America, this is a capitalist country.  It is a democratic republic.  This fucking place is not a place where you come and you're guaranteed fucking health care or wealth.  Leave me alone.  I've made something of myself, whether by hook or by crook or by luck.  I've made something of myself, and I'm not going to fucking dole it out for people that assume they have a right to fucking health care. 
[03:24:30]  You don't have a right to it.  You have a right to pursue happiness in this country, not a guarantee of happiness.  So get out of my pocket!  The Constitution says that Congress should be providing for the general welfare of the public.  And we have a welfare program.  And we have a welfare program.  The general welfare does not specifically refer to the welfare program that we have now.  It could also refer to people's health.  You can make that interpretation.  You're interpreting the Constitution into... 
[03:25:00]  What?  No, you're interpreting it into Karl Marx's manifesto, you fuck.  You can't interpret welfare into someone's health.  Why don't we leave it right there?  Because that was a great little line from Anthony.  You want to agree to disagree?  Yeah, let's agree to disagree.  All right, let's agree to disagree.  I think we got somewhere today.  You're wrong and that's right.  Oh!  Thank you, Adam, from Jersey.  All right, talk to you, too.  By the way, I hope Corazine gets re-elected and taxes the fucking ass out of you again. 
[03:25:30]  Thank you.  All right.  Yuck.  Wow.  I just fucking blew all my Hannity material.  Shit!  Well, Hannity's up next, so that's good news.  That was perfect timing because Sean's calling the show next.  Oh, my God.  Is that exhausting?  It is so exhausting.  Why do you like doing that?  I don't know.  It's just, I like it.  I hate doing that.  It's kind of fun. 
[03:26:00]  I don't like arguing with anybody that's not going to listen.  It's fun.  I don't care if they listen.  It's a great, it's like, it's an exercise in like, not in challenging somebody, but in  basically in your beliefs and their beliefs.  It's a way, in a way, because Adam, look, I don't agree with Adam, but he's not a dumb  guy.  He wasn't, at least he wasn't, you know what he did?  He talked over, he tried to talk over you a lot, but those conversations get pretty impassioned  and stuff, but, but he, at least he had some points and, you know, we didn't agree with  him, but he was making them and it wasn't like just some guy going, dude, you're an 
[03:26:30]  asshole.  But it just feels like those arguments never get anywhere.  They don't.  You're right.  Because no one listens.  You're right.  They just want to get their points out and show their knowledge and it's like, I don't  know.  But it's almost like, it's like if you, if you go into that knowing it, like healthy  debate.  It is.  It's not about changing.  There's no debate there.  Oh yeah, there was.  You know what else does?  Because nothing gets a compliment.  You know what gets a compliment?  It's two one-sided conversations going on, going on at the same time.  Let me explain something though.  There are people now that if that was in a bar and me and him were just talking, we're 
[03:27:00]  never going to change each other's opinion.  That would have ended with a fight.  With a fight.  Yeah.  And gunfire.  With fucking Patrick Swayze having to break it up.  Oh, fucking Dalton.  No shit.  Dalton would have to get involved.  But be nice.  Lead him out, but be nice.  But be nice.  That would have been me and him talking and not really changing each other's opinion.  But in this forum, it's interesting because I never think of it this way, but it is the  media.  So us talking like that, if someone's on the fence about something and I'm giving somebody  that's listening a little information, he's giving them a little information, I think 
[03:27:30]  it's making people that are listening kind of go, huh, I was on the fence about that  and I didn't know that.  So maybe you're not changing each other's minds, but you're kind of enlightening the  listeners in a way.  I got to be honest, I forgot that people were listening to this stuff.  So do I a lot of times.  No, for real.  I was just sitting and going, wow, I'm listening to Anthony have a conversation with a young  gentleman.  I do forget sometimes.  Sometimes people will listen to this dribble.  But that's a good point.  It's like some people are on the fence.  You do get some knowledge and go, oh, yeah, I didn't know about that.  And you throw it out there.  You can inform the listener. 
[03:28:00]  You can make the listener think you're an asshole, think you're a genius, whatever.  But yeah, that's what it is.  It's just two people having a healthy American debate about me being right and him being horribly  wrong.  But it also, in a way, it's like sometimes we think like, I have these thoughts in my head  and my paranoid and my nuts.  And then you hear somebody else doing something and you're like, no, I see, I know that's what  people do.  And it confirms to yourself, like, you know what?  I'm not fucking crazy.  I actually, my thinking was correct on that.  Like, you know, I just didn't like the, I think it's healthy to do.  I just didn't like that, uh, that attitude, that, that liberal attitude of you don't agree 
[03:28:30]  with me.  So you're wrong.  Yeah.  When meanwhile, I like getting into those conversations and I'll, I'll give it to anybody who has a  valid point and is educated on something, has done a little research and has come to a  different conclusion than I have based on whatever, based on whatever, but to then be  told that you're wrong or I only read two websites or I'm a puppet for this or that, knowing that 
[03:29:00]  I read a lot of shit and I've based my opinions on a lot of information and just because he  doesn't agree with them doesn't make me fucking wrong.  Right.  Come on.  But again, that elitist liberal, and I'm sorry, people on the left, it is an elitist liberal  thing.  It's something that is indicative of being a liberal because the conservatives have not  changed that much over the last X amount of years.  You kind of know where they stand on most, most things. 
[03:29:30]  A lot of times they're shitty and they're wrong.  But to me, the left has become a lot of what they hated, which is these thought policing  and people think you hate liberals.  I really don't.  I mean, I probably classify as a liberal much more in my social ideology than I do a conservative.  Yep.  I'm much more from most liberal causes than I am from most conservative religious causes.  I'm only talking about the attitude.  I love abortions.  I fucking love them.  I fucking, I want to have abortion tattooed on my balls.  But do you understand? 
[03:30:00]  I'm for gay marriage.  I'm for gay.  Of course you are.  A lot of the stuff that's fucking, no, I don't mean, stop it.  Me too.  Yes.  Yes.  But it's the arrogance that comes with it.  It's the fucking, may I say, pomposity.  Oh, you may.  Let's leave it here.  Let's wrap up.  We got a line of the day.  We got Jimmy's plug.  It's 1025 already?  Yeah, that went fast, huh?  Line of the day.  Thank that little fucker for calling in and making time fly.  Oh, shit.  Holy mackerel.  We came out of break thinking we had nothing.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  It was two old ladies at the door. 
[03:30:30]  Did you fuck them?  So I fucking plowed them, dude.  And they were selling.  They were both 25?  I was like a three-way.  Fuck, I thought it was mine.  And then I'm like, fuck, it's Anthony.  And then it's Jimmy's.  What the fuck?  Oh, it's all three of ours.  Don't give me hope like that, motherfucker.  Cut my part out.  Line of the day time.  Jimmy, what's your plug? 
[03:31:00]  Connecticut tonight, right?  Tonight.  Tomorrow, Saturday.  Right outside of Hartford.  It's the Funny Bone.  Let me give you the number.  860-432-8600.  And then I have tickets going on sale soon for fucking Kansas City, Boston, and somewhere else.  When I'm coming back up to Boston, I'm going to Kansas City.  And, you know, I'll keep you updated.  Janitor Pants, very upset.  Why?  Janitor Pants.  Oh, no.  He writes, you guys are going to be funny today.  I've turned you off three times.  Boring, boring, and boring.  Yeah, because it's only, you know, something that's really relevant. 
[03:31:30]  And we did an entire show.  We probably spent, what, 25 minutes maybe on that at most.  But the entire rest of the show, we didn't.  You know, just fucking.  What can I tell you?  Turn on Comedy Central and drool.  And just sit on your couch.  And he finishes with, do something funny.  Opie.  Jesus Christ.  Is he comparing you to the two of you?  Oh, yeah.  We're pretty similar in many ways, Jimmy. 
[03:32:00]  I like hearing people argue.  I really do like it.  If it's a point that I'm interested in, and they both sound kind of okay, I like to hear  that shit.  What is it called?  The barometer?  My barometer is this.  When we get going into something like that, and you see the phone's just ridiculously lit,  and Travis can't answer them fast enough, I sit back and go, radio is happening, my  friends.  Radio is happening.  Poor Travis.  My barometer is if I have a big tent in my pants, Ant's right.  That's how I know. 
[03:32:30]  And then there's other days you think you're doing something that's interesting.  You look at the phones, and there's nothing happening.  So I like that barometer.  When those phones are lit like that, I'm like, yeah.  That means people are being impacted and want to comment.  They're compelled.  They feel compelled to get their opinion across.  And you know what?  Yes.  Nap for me.  Oh, fuck you.  I'm ready for a nap.  No, I do catnaps during the political stuff.  Oh, you do a little catnap?  Yeah, it keeps me fresh.  Yeah, I need a nap now.  It keeps me fresh.  I'm going to sleep on the way home like I usually do. 
[03:33:00]  That's good.  Great.  Dozing off in a fucking five-ton vehicle doing 90.  You know what?  I'm going to defend Janitor Pants because then Blue Heeler says, Janitor Pants sounds like a hater.  I don't think he's a hater.  You know the difference between people that are a little frustrated because we're doing something that they're not interested in,  and then just pure haters that don't like anything we do but make believe they're fans of the show.  It's very obvious, the difference.  So I respect Janitor Pants for not liking that segment today. 
[03:33:30]  But a lot of people did.  Janitor Pants is a jizz bucket and should fall into a ditch and fucking get a compound fracture in both his legs right through his stupid Janitor Pants.  His fucking shin bones should stick out and get fucking, like, thread on them and have to be severed.  Jimmy, he knows funny, though.  His name is Janitor Pants.  Janitor Pants.  Pretty funny.  That's cool.  That's funny.  I hope Janitor Pants right now is on his way back from the doctor with some very fucking bad news. 
[03:34:00]  I hope Janitor Pants just wanted to laugh.  Because he just found out that the old pancreatic C grabbed a hold of him, too.  And he just wanted to laugh.  And we disappointed him.  Oh, poor Janitor Pants.  Is it line of the daytime?  I hope Janitor Pants gets to the point where he has to take one leg of his Janitor Pants and tie it in a knot.  Because he doesn't need it.  Because he's diabetic.  I hope old diabetic Janitor Pants.  No, actually, I hope his leg is torn off in an accident that he got yelling at the radio at us. 
[03:34:30]  Like, I hope he drove into a ditch and his fucking leg was pinned and they had to cut it.  Cut through his Janitor Pants.  Exactly.  And now he's a fucking one-legged bird in a fucking chair.  And his wife leaves him for a man of color who fucks her better.  Jesus.  You just had an opinion about this show, Jimmy.  I didn't like his opinion, so I want him one-legged and alone forever.  We get called equal justice for what he did.  If he's a true fan, we've got to respect all opinions on this show.  I hope Janitor Pants is...  I'm all in with the haters.  They're ridiculous and we all need to just get rid of them. 
[03:35:00]  He's not a fan of the show.  Get them out of our lives.  He's a queer.  Here's what he is.  I hope Janitor Pants right now is being fitted for a prosthetic and he's trying to keep his chin up.  I can learn to use this.  And then his fucking stump is sweaty and he falls on his teeth.  But more importantly, Mario Cantone is on Wendy Williams doing his Julia Child impression.  That is good.  Oh, wow.  That is good when he does that.  I knew that would stop the show.  There he goes.  Yes, it did.  Jimmy, can we get back to the fact that I might be just like Jesus?  I think you are. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, in what way?  In ways that you're very forgiving and that you have a quiet love about you.  And you walk on water.  While everyone else walks on eggshells.  That's true.  That's funny.  Thank you.  See, I can be funny.  You can take...  I was funny just there.  You can take one yogurt and make many yogurts.  I couldn't think of other things Christ has done.  Oh, this is going somewhere.  I was really hoping you would go off on a nice little tangent here about me and Jesus.  Nah, I'm just... 
[03:36:00]  Me and Jesus.  We're all trying to get to the crucifix part.  There you go.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes...  La, la, la, la.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Nah.  It's going to pain me to play the next one.  This person has done so much for the Opie and Anthony show.  Really?  To Coke Logic or Steven? 
[03:36:30]  We know it's not Steve C or E-Rock.  Take that, stupid and stupid.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Fucking Jimmy.  Saying thank you to the recording.  That's great.  That's funny.  Janitor Pants turned you off three times today but turned you on four.  See, that's good.  That's right.  That's a good batting average right there, huh?  Right.  As long as you turned the show on more times than you turned it off.  That's all we care about.  That's how much you guys suck today.  Yeah.  I hope right now Janitor Pants is tasting the fucking, his own coppery blood. 
[03:37:00]  Hope right now the back of his teeth have his own blood drying on it.  Oh, that fucking blood taste.  That awful copper flavor of blood.  I know that taste every month.  Yes.  Jesus.  I don't.  I don't care.  Oh, fucking get out of my house.  Lay in the hallway, dog.  What are you, city?  The fucking period comes, they fucking sleep in the hallway.  I throw a blanket at them.  Here you are, farm animal.  Take that fucking bleeding hole you call a vag and fucking, don't. 
[03:37:30]  Beat it.  Don't bleed on my fucking Sabbath photo.  Scram.  Yeah, exactly.  Scram, you tick.  Yeah, lay under the bed, piglet.  You tick.  Anthony, you get right in there or what?  You get right in there?  I don't give a shit.  I don't care.  You'll go down on that?  With women, I don't care what the fuck is going on.  Jesus, I can barely eat a bloody steak.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You need a steak cooked well done.  I can barely eat a bloody steak, and you're diving right into that. 
[03:38:00]  I will dive in.  I'll come up.  Does it ever get clumpy?  Looking like I just had cherry pie.  Oh, Jesus.  I look like one of the little rascals ate some cherry pie.  You look like the coyote that stole Jessica Simpson's little dog.  Yes, exactly.  Licking my chops.  Have you really had just a messy face?  No.  Although my goatee at one point did look like Eastside Dave's.  For real? 
[03:38:30]  For reals, yo.  I don't know.  I don't look in the mirror afterwards.  I wipe my face on the pillow like any self-respecting guy.  And, you know, sometimes the pillow looks like Lizzie Borden's parents.  Oh, my God.  Nice 1800s joke, Anthony.  Oh, that's good.  There's been no one bloodied since Lizzie Borden.  Of course.  You could have said Nicole Kidman.  True.  I meant to say Brown Simpson, but I said Kidman.  I said true like I was listening.  Dumb and dumber.  Wow.  Geez, do we stink.  Nicole Kidman.  You could be like her, I guess, and have no relevance to that joke. 
[03:39:00]  True.  You want another debate?  He's waiting.  Jake in Tennessee.  I'm done.  Let's start him off and see how he goes.  We'll just see.  You know, it's only fair, Anthony.  Yeah.  A lot of people are saying that Adam wasn't that good.  All right.  So get ready here.  Okay.  I think we have another liberal.  Jake, you want to debate Anthony?  We only have a couple more minutes before Ron and Fez.  Good evening.  Hiya, Jake.  Hi, Jake.  What's the scoop?  I'm not a liberal gentleman.  I had one piece of information to contribute. 
[03:39:30]  But first of all, Jimmy categorized himself as a liberal.  He lets hookers take shits on his chest.  That's a real stretch, Jim.  Yeah, I think we could call you a liberal.  That's a liberal attitude.  Yeah, I'm not saying I'm aliberal, but I agree with him more on a lot of social issues.  Social issues.  Yes.  Fiscally conservative.  Militarily conservative.  Militarily conservative.  Homeland Security, I think you're pretty conservative.  Yes.  There's a few things that are a little iffy.  Yeah, here's all I wanted to throw out to you. 
[03:40:00]  I've had several conversations with both pediatricians for my kids as well as a doctor that I visit from time to time.  And what you will find is that.  Did he get us?  No.  Was he trying to get us?  What are you?  No.  You hung up there.  You think someone's going to get the kid?  No.  Right now, Spittle is still in the corner of his mouth.  He doesn't know he's been hung up on.  No one's listening, Jake.  We rarely go past 1030 these days.  No.  No.  Nope. 
[03:40:30]  Ron and Fez next.  Go fuck yourselves.  Later.  Thank you. </pre>
