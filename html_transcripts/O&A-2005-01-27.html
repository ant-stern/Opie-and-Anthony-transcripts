<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a nonsensical audio snippet before launching into a discussion about the cold New York City studio, contrasting it with their warmer, more social previous workplace.  In-studio guest Noah, noted for his unusual attire, was present. Opie detailed his new showering habits (showering the night before), leading to humorous commentary about his morning hair. The hosts then discussed an upcoming interview with CBS This Morning regarding FCC indecency complaints.  A significant portion focused on the state of Opie's couch, detailing various bodily fluids left by past guests. They reminisced about their WNEW afternoon drive show and the more active social life it provided.

A news story about a man's suicide attempt by placing his Jeep on a train track, resulting in a fatal derailment, sparked a darkly humorous discussion about selfish suicide methods. This transitioned into a discussion of the "Tsunami Song" from Hot 97, its offensive lyrics, and the subsequent suspension of the hosts.  The song was played on air, prompting critique of its poor quality and perceived hypocrisy of those involved.  The hosts speculated about the suspended hosts' impending firing and potential media appearances.  Multiple callers contributed throughout this section.

The show then delved into a debate about hip-hop lyrics, covering violence, racism, sexism, and lighter themes of "booty" and "bling," referencing artists like NWA, Ghetto Boys, and Will Smith. This segued into a discussion about radio censorship, sparked by listener outrage over the tsunami parody song, exploring the balance between free speech and station control.  The hosts argued that corporate pressure, not the FCC, posed a greater threat.  This led to a heated debate with Mel Karmazin, challenging his criticisms of their past actions, invoking Howard Stern to deflect criticism.

Several audio clips followed: expletive-laden Casey Kasem outtakes; a caller's sad tale about a deceased pet; and a detailed news report about New Jersey Governor Richard Cody's wife's postpartum depression, including suicidal and homicidal thoughts, prompting a mixed reaction from the hosts.  The show also touched upon a potential Sirius/XM merger, speculated on Karmazin's motives, and accused "The Jersey Guys" of plagiarism.  Super Bowl plans and a coworker's nasal surgery were briefly discussed, along with the international coverage of the tsunami song and further comments on a coworker's fashion choices.

A listener's attire (a leather jacket with potentially offensive Russian writing referencing "Negroes") initiated another segment. This led to a discussion of a listener-submitted "admitted homosexual" list by "C-Rock," incorrectly labeling individuals, including Noah, who humorously defended himself.  Martini Steve was in the studio, having arrived early to compile audio. "Steve the Bear," a listener-created song, was played. Callers expressed concern about a perceived decrease in explicit content and self-censorship. The hosts discussed various online message boards (WackBag.com, opianthony.net, CringeHumor.net) and their interactions. A caller recounted a prank involving an Opie and Anthony sign resulting in a near-miss with an Eyewitness News crew.  Finally, Leroy Wells' American Idol audition was discussed and played.

The American Idol discussion continued, focusing on Leroy Wells’ bizarre audition, the judges (particularly criticizing Gene Simmons), and other bad auditions. News broke during the broadcast that Wells had been arrested for shooting into an occupied vehicle.  A caller, Mark, played a bit pretending to call his mother to tell her he was in jail with prostitutes, including a transvestite. The segment included more American Idol commentary, Gene Simmons' age, more bad audition clips, and graphic discussions about a new intern, Noah's, physical attributes and sexual preferences, featuring crude language and sexually explicit topics. Bob Kelly's indecent exposure was mentioned, along with several commercial breaks and a baseball advertisement.

A caller, "Noah," recounted a sexual encounter, prompting a humorous and suggestive back-and-forth about the inconsistencies of his story. The hosts used homophobic slurs and made sexually explicit jokes, teasing Noah about his perceived femininity and questioning his sexual orientation. Bob Kelly was in the studio. A phone interview with Adam Duritz of Counting Crows discussed his Oscar nomination for "Accidentally in Love."  Big Ten basketball game snippets and XM Satellite Radio promotions were interspersed.  The show concluded with listener feedback, mostly jokes about Noah and Duritz, a humorous exchange regarding Bob Kelly's return, and Jim Norton's penis.

[00:07:30]  We're tanks for nothing!  Tanks for nothing.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Greetings. 
[00:08:00]  You are listening to the pioneers of satellite radio.  We did it first, like it or not.  Howie.  I don't care.  He just doesn't care.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to everyone that works for us.  Thanks to our fans.  And thanks to Anthony and I.  There you go.  Let's thank ourselves.  Pat ourselves on the back?  I'm trying, look.  Oh, wow. 
[00:08:30]  It's a fine 11 degrees out today in New York City.  I have no idea why we're broadcasting from New York City when we can broadcast from a warm  climate, Anthony.  But that's going to be something we're going to have to figure out for next winter.  Next winter, absolutely, definitely, we've got to do it.  Why the hell are we here in New York?  It's not like we're here because we're getting a lot of guests here in New York.  A lot of quality guests.  You don't like the quality of guests we're getting?  Well, you know, the in-studio guests. 
[00:09:00]  We could do any.  Hey, how you doing there, Noah?  Noah's in today.  Great.  Crept up behind me.  Made me a little nervous.  That's all.  Got my banana, my bagel.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, my God.  We really are trying to ignore him.  But he's leather clad today.  Yeah, now he's just trying to look really tough, and it's just not working.  Tough guy.  I mean, he's got, like, you know, the typical tough guy leather jacket on and worn jeans 
[00:09:30]  and, I don't know, some kind of, like, rougher-looking shoes.  But then he has the BMW hat still being worn like I've never seen a baseball cap worn before.  Way back on his head.  And then he's got really expensive Gucci sunglasses on.  What color are they, yellow?  I didn't even know they're expensive.  I don't own expensive sunglasses.  I just don't.  I think they're amber.  I got a pair of, like, Maui gyms, which is, you know, it's a nice-priced sunglass, but nothing too fancy. 
[00:10:00]  But Ben is looking at them in the office going, wow, Gucci sunglasses, that had to cost you a pretty penny.  Of course, he's a little rich kid.  He's richy-rich.  We'll get into Noah a little later.  Anyway, yes, the warm-weather guest, what were we saying here?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, we take a lot of phone guests.  We could do that in a warm place.  We don't have to be here in freezing cold New York.  11 degrees.  11 effing degrees. 
[00:10:30]  Everyone comes in here.  You know, it's just, it would be such a treat to walk into the studios and go to the office  and have everyone kind of in a good mood.  But everyone that walks in that door is going like, oh, Jesus, fuck, my God.  Like, everyone's just aggravated right when they walk in.  It's like right when you get up in the morning and have to leave your house, you're aggravated.  And it's funny, we all stagger in.  So we're sitting there, and one by one, you know, an intern comes in or Master Poe or whoever, 
[00:11:00]  and we have to hear the bitching.  Son of a bitch!  Oh, God, it's freezing out!  Yeah, we know.  We just came from there.  Yeah, and we bitched just before you got here.  Yeah, yeah.  The bitching that was heard before you, that was me.  Before me, it was him.  Yeah, exactly.  The bitching that just comes in, but it puts you in this mood, just nasty, and there's  no reason we should be here.  You're right.  I got to tell you, though, Anthony, I'm a new person.  Who are you?  I showered last night.  I finally took your advice. 
[00:11:30]  The shower the night before.  I showered last night.  I got up at 4.20, and I felt like I had so much time on my hands.  See?  It was absolutely insane.  So now my alarm clock goes to 4.30 starting tonight.  Oh, 4.30.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Eventually, I'm going to get it to like 10 to 5 and just stagger out of bed and run to  the station by 5.  Now you're sleeping.  I mean, look at the hair.  Oh, I know.  I showered last night, but what I have to figure out is I got to shower. 
[00:12:00]  A couple hours before I go to bed, like my hair was still wet.  Oh, it's still wet.  So you lay down, and you get that flat piece.  Look at it, dude.  Not that you care about crap like this, but look at it.  Hence the hat every day.  I shower the night before.  It's like it's so easy to just throw a cap on.  So are you telling me I got to shower like around 6, 7, so it gives my hair a couple hours  to dry, so it doesn't, so I don't walk in like this?  Yeah, so you don't have that pillow head welded into your hair because it was wet. 
[00:12:30]  You know, CBS This Morning, I think, is coming in tomorrow.  He's about to interview us for, I think, Charles Osgood's show.  Charles Osgood.  I think it might even be on this Sunday.  I think they're doing a whole thing on the FCC, and, well, we're the poster children for  indecency, I guess.  Always included.  And I'm thinking, Anthony, that I'm going to come in again tomorrow like this.  Really?  You want to be on camera?  You know how we kind of try to look sort of good for TV?  That middle piece just flips up. 
[00:13:00]  I know.  You got like a squiggy going.  It's the most effed up thing, bro.  I think I'm just going to come in like this tomorrow.  I can't even.  Now you really did it.  I can't even get it down.  You're trying to fix it.  It's just making it work.  Oh, man.  Talk for a second.  It's fluffed up all.  I got to throw my hat back on.  Now there's a curl in the front that's going straight up.  It's the worst.  All right.  There you go.  But I at least changed my shirt, and I actually had to give up on the pair of pants I've been 
[00:13:30]  wearing for about eight days.  Oh, yeah.  You changed your sweater.  Very good.  Yeah.  I mean, I...  You're going with the Danny Wool cap look.  Well, I had to.  Danny the intern.  I got to like squash all this hair.  Yeah.  The curl is hysterical.  Anyway.  One of the pitfalls of showering the night before, but at least you get a little more  sleep.  Oh, it's great.  Now I got to get a coffee maker that has one of those alarm clocks on it things.  Yeah.  Because now I'm making the coffee the night before, too, so I stagger out of bed, just 
[00:14:00]  push the button.  You push the button?  You don't have a timer?  No, I don't.  Oh, you got to get a timer.  That way you wake up.  I never really needed a timer before, but...  Best part of waking up.  There you go.  So, all right.  Let's move on with the program here.  Oh.  A couple people want to say hi.  We got lots to do today, man.  Lots.  I'm kind of...  Before you get to Max, we're sticking with the same subject for just a couple of minutes  more.  Yes.  I kind of shower and then go to bed, and it's been earlier and earlier every night now. 
[00:14:30]  We just go...  We go into bed and watch TV in there.  I got home yesterday and fell asleep.  Now, I would love to turn on the big screen television, recline on the couch, and take  a nap.  The booger couch?  Exactly.  I can't.  You still haven't sat on the booger couch?  No.  Have not even sat on it.  I sit in my computer chair, and now what I do, I'll screw around with the computer a 
[00:15:00]  little bit when I get home, but I'm too tired, and I can't stare at the screen.  I had a headache the other day from just staring at the screen too long.  So, I was like, God, I really want to watch TV.  I don't want to go to bed at three o'clock in the afternoon, you know?  So, I figured I couldn't sit on the booger couch, so I'm sitting in my computer chair.  I spun around to look at the TV and rested my arms on the back of the couch, where my  computer chair is, and leaned my head on my hands and fell asleep like a hostage. 
[00:15:30]  I was sitting down.  Here I have this beautiful couch.  I'm sitting down with my head on my hands over the back of the couch on a computer chair,  on a rolling office chair.  I woke up, my back killing me, finally went to bed at 4.30 in the afternoon.  I was in bed at 4.30.  For the night?  Yeah, but we watched Outlaw Josie Wales, which is like a three-hour movie.  Right, right, right.  So, I wasn't going to bed to go to bed, but I need a couch.  We have swatches coming, Opie. 
[00:16:00]  Swatches are on their way for color, and then we will get a couch.  But in the meantime, I have this huge, like, ten-person modular couch with two, two-count'em,  recliners in the couch.  But you know the kid wasn't sitting on...  La, la, la, la, la, la.  What's that you said, Opie?  What was that I didn't hear?  You know the kid didn't sit all over the couch?  La, la, la, la, la, la.  I think you said something.  I didn't even hear it.  Why don't you just tape off the area that he sat on? 
[00:16:30]  Like, like, put police tape around?  Knowing the boogers in that area, I...  And then he could enjoy the rest of the couch for a while.  You know why?  Dude, I...  Do you know why?  Because a good point was brought up.  Perhaps that was only the one you saw.  Perhaps that was only the one that was commented on when the young child was visiting the house  and wiped a booger on my couch.  Dude, I got something worse than that, man.  I mean, I've been looking at my couch lately because of all this talk. 
[00:17:00]  Someone splooged on my couch.  Simple as that.  Someone splooged on my couch.  That should be something you should have an answer to.  You should absolutely know who could have splooged on your couch.  There's been people here and there, you know, that have stayed at my place and, you know...  Jay doesn't come and bring, like, someone with him.  I'm thinking it might have been someone just whacking.  Someone splooged on my couch.  Who has slept on your couch that might perhaps have whacked?  I've had some...  I've had brothers and...  You think your brothers would come over and whack it on your couch? 
[00:17:30]  I don't know.  You can't take one day off while you're at families on their furniture?  My buddy Jay...  You think Jay might have?  I don't know.  All excited from that job-a-log experience with a fireman coming in?  Dude, there's two spots and I'm like, because of you.  I'm like, oh, God.  What is that?  Here we go.  Could it have been you?  Here we go.  Could it have been you?  How long have you had the couch?  No, man.  Any activity on it?  No, I don't whack on the couch.  No.  No, no, no.  Yeah?  No, no, no.  Not on the couch. 
[00:18:00]  No.  Wasn't there a story once about you...  Yeah, it's an old story.  ...munching NASCAR with an Afghan...  Holy ass!  Did Steve sleep over my place, too?  Yeah, because I had Steve sleep over.  Oh, we all know what a pervert he is.  No, Club Soda Kenny slept there.  Oh, my God.  Please tell me it's not Club Soda Kenny's...  He wouldn't do that.  On which couch?  Your couch upstairs or downstairs?  Upstairs.  I would never do that to your couch, Opie.  He's very concerned, because I was talking about how lonely I am yesterday, and he wrote  a long email.  Where is it?  I'll have to get my email.  What a kook. 
[00:18:30]  I'll get it in a little bit.  He is a kook.  He's all concerned, because I am real...  I don't know what's going on.  I was thinking about you and I yesterday, actually, and I was thinking that we...  You and I are getting stranger and stranger.  I know.  I know.  What happened, Todd?  We used to be, like, very overtly weird and strange on the air.  Our fans saw it, but it was kind of, like, you know, accepted because it was radio weird,  you know?  We do weird things when we go out, you know, at the bars and stuff, and people, you know,  we do contests, and women show in their cans, and we're signing boobs, like, that kind 
[00:19:00]  of thing, where normal people really don't get the opportunity to do it, but now we're  kind of, we're folding inward.  I think we are.  Like, now it's covert weirdness.  Because, I don't know, this is a very, it's a very lonely existence right now.  It's very strange.  When we were doing afternoon drive, you know, for WNEW, we were...  We were out at night!  Well, besides that, I mean, we got to work, you know, 10, 11. 
[00:19:30]  There was a lot of activity.  You could go to lunch with your fellow workers, meet with the bosses.  There was just a lot of stuff going on, meeting with, you know, potential clients.  Yeah, we would get in pretty early, and before the show, there was a lot going on, just hanging  out.  And then you'd do the radio show, and then afterwards, there was always something to do,  whether it was happy hour or go to a comedy club.  It was cool to have the sun out, and it was afternoon when we were in that office, because  it, like, livened the whole place up.  Remember the office?  There was, like, a party going on before the show.  Always.  People coming and going. 
[00:20:00]  You know, we're goofing on each other.  Yeah, people coming in and out.  We're playing video games.  We would watch those girls take showers before the show.  Yeah.  We had lots of stuff to do.  Now, with XM Satellite, it's, you know, we're the only show here in New York, basically.  I mean, a couple guys spin some tunes here and there, but besides...  And they don't even come in until after the show's over now.  Yeah.  So, it's weird.  We show up here at five.  There's absolutely no one here.  The heat's barely on.  Yeah.  You know, we do the radio show, and then, you know, by 10, 30, 11 o'clock, we go home,  and it just... 
[00:20:30]  There's nothing to do.  You're tired.  There's nothing to do.  I just kind of wander around.  Everyone else is at work, so there's no one to really hang out with.  So, yeah, you try to find something to do until, I swear, when it hits like 3 p.m., 3 o'clock  in the afternoon, I'm going, oh, well, it's almost bedtime.  Like, the day is shot for me at 3.  I'm already thinking about, all right, tomorrow.  Just forget about the rest of the day.  It is the dumbest existence ever.  It starts, yeah, around 4 for me. 
[00:21:00]  4?  Yeah, 4 o'clock, I'm thinking, wow, I've got to eat dinner because it's almost bedtime.  Yeah.  Yeah, you've got to eat at these weird times because you can't eat right before you go  to bed, but you go to bed so early, so you've got to, like, oh, dinner time.  It's, you know, 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  And then, you know, I do have friends and stuff.  They call around 7, 7.30.  Hey, you want to grab a bite to eat?  I'm like, are you insane?  You're on some form of drug.  Are you insane?  You know what time I wake up?  Right.  Ridiculous.  This lifestyle, you're right.  It's a very lonely existence. 
[00:21:30]  It's really strange, is all I'm saying.  I don't want people to feel sorry for us.  I do.  It's just weird, though.  No, it is weird.  And sometimes, right before I go to bed, I'll remember I need something from the store,  so I'll quickly go to the end of my block or whatever.  Wow.  And it'll be right around 9 o'clock.  At night?  Well.  You're out of the house at 9 at night?  You're a mad man.  I'm just saying, for something quick, like I need milk for my coffee or something stupid,  right?  Yeah.  And I'm looking around, and everyone's walking around, and I'm like, are these people insane?  It's the middle of the night. 
[00:22:00]  I know.  Middle of the night.  It might as well be 2 in the morning when you're looking at people at 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock  at night.  Anyway.  I don't go out.  Once I pull that car into the airlock that is my garage, it is like I am at a ship, and  outside might as well be outer space.  I do not leave.  Show's over.  I walk home.  If I'm lucky, I get to have breakfast with Jim Norton or somebody.  Oh!  That's a highlight. 
[00:22:30]  Then I go home.  I take my 40-minute nap.  I get up.  I go online.  I go offline.  I go back online.  I go offline, back online, offline.  Then I go upstairs for a little while, maybe watch some Honeymooners.  Then I put my gym clothes on.  I go to the gym every day.  I come back from the gym.  Sometimes I get a cup of coffee at Starbucks and look at all the idiots outside the window.  I'm exhausted just listening to it.  And then I walk back home, and I go back online.  And then I go offline, then back online, then offline. 
[00:23:00]  That's what it is.  And then it's around 5 or 6, time to get a little dinner.  Almost bedtime.  Then I watch some stupid entertainment news on TV, The Insider or E.T., and then I go  to bed.  I feel so good when I'm online and I find a story that I know we're going to use the  next day.  I'm like, oh, I'm doing work for the show.  I'm home.  I'm doing work for the show.  I'm actually being productive.  And that happens like once in a blue moon, you know?  Most of the other time, I'm playing Battlefield 1942 with 15-year-olds online, getting pissed 
[00:23:30]  off because they're shooting the plane that I'm running to right before I get to it.  And then I'll start, like, yelling at the screen.  And then I'll just go, what?  Like a moment of clarity hits me.  I go, why am I yelling?  And I hit escape, quit, back online to look for news stories.  And then within a half hour, I'm back at it again.  Getting all pissed off at video games.  It's just a weird, weird existence.  I mean, I'm having a good time, but... 
[00:24:00]  Afternoons were a little more conducive to our lifestyles.  I like this version of the radio show much better than the afternoon show.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  But the lifestyle I liked in afternoons better.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  Yeah, lifestyle, when you do morning radio, stinks.  But the radio show is a lot more fun to do.  Yeah.  In my opinion.  I love being the first one to talk about the latest news and stuff.  The news.  Yeah.  Speaking of which, my God.  You hear about this dope in California?  Oh, what a son of a bitch, selfish bastard this guy is. 
[00:24:30]  You want to kill yourself, kill yourself.  Please, do the world a favor.  However, but could you just not involve other people that are just trying to go to work or  get home from work?  This ass pulls his Jeep.  He's got a Grand Cherokee.  See, this went down during our show yesterday, and I'm thinking, oh, wow, what a tragedy.  Maybe there was a switching problem or whatever, you know?  Derailed somehow. 
[00:25:00]  Derailed.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  The guy pulls his Jeep Grand Cherokee up on a railroad crossing, and he's going to kill  himself.  Right there, even if it worked, is you're a bastard.  You know, the guy's trying to drive the train, doing his job every day, and he's got to deal  with your sorry ass parked in front of his locomotive.  So he pulls up there.  At the last minute, he decides, eh, maybe I didn't give this enough thought.  I really don't want to kill myself.  So instead of pulling off the tracks, he opens the door, gets out, and runs off. 
[00:25:30]  The train hits the SUV, derails, and just poor timing, another train is coming the other  way, and as it derails, it derails right into the path of the other train.  They hit head on, 11 people dead, hundreds injured, because this guy decided at the last  minute, eh, maybe I don't want to kill myself.  So now he's in jail for 10 counts of murder, and good luck to you. 
[00:26:00]  And here's the beauty of it.  The guy definitely wants to kill himself.  Yeah.  He's now killed, what, 10, 11 people?  Yeah.  That total might rise.  And he'll never get the death penalty.  No.  He won't get the death.  Not in California.  Forever and ever.  But how strange is that?  The guy wants to kill himself, now he commits a crime where, you know, I mean, maybe it  could be argued that they should, you know, throw him on death row, but it'll never happen.  No, they would.  Not for those circumstances.  No, I know, I know.  The guy.  But, you know, it's the same thing with these people that jump out of the buildings. 
[00:26:30]  They jump out and land on somebody, or even land in front of somebody.  We had that story at the Harley Davidson Cafe a few years back.  Guy, selfish bastard.  Yeah, he jumps from whatever.  That guy.  Whatever, the 10th floor or whatever.  Kills himself, obviously.  Makes himself into sidewalk pizza.  Yep.  But he pretty much brushed up against the girl as she, you know, as she was just walking and  enjoying her lunch hour.  Yeah, his hand hit her shoulder.  And now she's horrified for the rest of her life, because she was this close to dying. 
[00:27:00]  And I had a witness, a big splat.  Right.  Like, ugh, they're so selfish like that.  You're going to kill yourself.  Do the pills, maybe.  Do the gunshot alone.  Do the Kurt Cobain.  Yeah, the Kurt Cobain is the way it goes.  You're alone.  No one's there.  Although, someone's got to find you, which is kind of cruel.  Maybe you call the cops.  That's probably good, because cops, you know, you're in it for that line of way.  Once you become a cop, it's expected you're going to see some gruesome stuff. 
[00:27:30]  You don't become a cop thinking, oh my god, I didn't want to see that.  You know?  So call the cops?  Joke about things like that.  So what you do is, you call the cops, but you don't put the thing to your ear, so they  can't talk you out of it.  You call the cops, and just talk into the phone, and go, hi, my batteries are dead.  I'm killing myself, because my batteries are dead in my bullhorn.  And then you turn the phone so you can't hear them, and go, I'm killing myself.  That kid, I like.  He's a go-getter.  He is a go-getter. 
[00:28:00]  Eric knows you don't have batteries.  He's already getting new batteries from across the office.  He's a-running.  And look at that.  He's got a brand new pack of batteries.  He's opening them.  Then you...  Problem solved.  You take the gun.  Look at that.  You're done.  The cops are on their way to clean up the mess, so no loved ones or gardeners or anything  has to find you.  Right.  And you've done it.  You've killed yourself.  No problem.  All right.  Leave the people on the trains alone. 
[00:28:30]  What a tragic story, though.  Absolutely tragic, so.  That was the story, by the way, if you were listening yesterday.  We brought up the Pat from Munaki reference when he was in telling his last joke.  Nothing short of a huge train wreck.  I listened to the replay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is Pat just the most unfunny son of a bitch?  I love the replay.  It is so much fun to get to hear the show like that.  Old days, you'd have to tape it and bring it home with you. 
[00:29:00]  Now, you know, I mean, I listen online.  There's more comedy in his missing pinky toe.  Yeah.  Or whatever toe that was.  Yeah, I listened to the replay on the way home.  I got a little chuckle.  Sometimes I forget what we did.  All right.  Let's go to Bobby in Staten Island.  Bobby.  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  Bobby.  No.  Come on, guys.  Use the manual button.  You know how I bitched and complained what we all did about our situation here at XM? 
[00:29:30]  Because it is really frustrating.  Then Kevin tried to call me all day yesterday.  But what did I say?  Stray low?  What did I say?  No phone calls.  I'm not taking anybody's phone calls.  So.  But then he wrote a long email about how we're going to try to solve the audio problems on  the show.  Yes, Bobby.  Hold on, Bobby.  Hold on, please.  So he writes a really long email.  Expecting a response from me.  I just write, okay.  Two letters.  Okay.  I didn't want to hear it yesterday. 
[00:30:00]  I don't want to hear the same crap.  I want to actually see something happen.  I want a phone call from Elo that says, guys, enough with the talk.  This is happening starting on this date.  Whether it's marketing, getting us off the premium channel.  Levels.  Guys, here's your Super Bowl trip.  I don't want to hear any more BS phone calls that go nowhere.  Okay.  I want to see action now.  Ow.  Action of you impaling yourself with a pen. 
[00:30:30]  Hey, Bobby, go ahead.  Hey, Bobby.  You guys rock.  But you got to stop playing that tsunami song.  I was up all night, and at 4 o'clock in the morning, I'm staring at the ceiling.  As I lie there, the melody going over and over in my head.  I wanted to strangle you guys.  You know what?  We're going to play the tsunami song.  And we're going to give you the tsunami update.  The tsunami update.  Are they fired yet?  They're suspended.  I'm very suspicious.  I'm wondering.  Well, we'll get into it next, but I'm wondering if the company's going to try to ride this  one out. 
[00:31:00]  They could try.  Which would be a brilliant move, by the way, but I just don't know if they have the  balls to do it.  Not after tomorrow.  There's going to be some kind of press conference.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a really quick break, and we'll give you the tsunami update, because  this is a soap opera.  This storyline's coming and going.  Morning, Jimmy.  Hi, guys.  It was pretty funny.  The herky-jerky Ben comes in here.  I just woke up Jimmy, and Jimmy's like, ugh!  I did it again!  I did it again!  Do you know how awful it is to get a phone call and hear Ecstasy of the Gold playing in 
[00:31:30]  the background?  You just know you're not making it on time.  And the best is sometimes you will mess with Ben, you know, and you'll be in the elevator  as Ben's calling you, but this was legit today.  Yeah, he knew it, too.  How are we supposed to call this show Norton and Friends if you can't even start Norton  and Friends?  Oh, the fifth end, Friends.  I got no excuses.  I went to bed last night at 11.30, and I got two hours of sleep before that.  I got my sleep.  You know what image I have in my head?  Ecstasy of Gold playing, and Norton running like Tuco through the cemetery, just running 
[00:32:00]  to the station.  You know how hard it is to put a sock on while you're holding an electric toothbrush in your  mouth?  You can't call the show Norton and Friends if there's going to be Ecstasy of Gold and  then 25 minutes of dead air while you get to the station.  I know, but maybe the spin is that Norton likes to let his friends shine for a while.  Well, his friends show up first and wait for Norton on the stoop.  Check this out, by the way.  Look at my hair.  It looks good.  Shower the night before.  It's starting to flatten out.  He's doing that now.  I started showering the night before.  Ripping me off. 
[00:32:30]  I did that first.  I was the one who showered first.  Of course.  You've done everything first.  I'm a pioneer.  Of course you are.  We know it.  You've done everything first.  I'm talking about people that weren't forced into the shower.  I voluntarily went and took a shower.  Yeah.  I pioneered showering before work.  You know, one of our listeners got through to Howard the other day and asked him, well,  don't you feel like you're following Opie and Anthony to satellite radio?  Which he is.  But, you know, you can spin anything.  Now, technically, I'm the first guy whose name starts with H to go to satellite. 
[00:33:00]  And I think that speaks volumes.  Look, it's a talent to be able to spin stuff.  We understand that.  We do a very good job with that on our own program.  I do it in life.  Yeah.  We're good spin doctors, okay?  Yeah.  So the guy gets through and goes, hey, Howard, don't you feel like you're following Opie  and Anthony to satellite radio?  And you know, that one got through and he's like, oh, oh.  So what did he say?  I think we have the audio somewhere. 
[00:33:30]  He said he was the first person that voluntarily went over from broadcast to satellite.  We were forced into satellite because we were stupid and had people have sex in a church  and were unhirable.  And he says we're still unhirable on commercial radio.  That's not true.  First of all, Fareed hired us to fill in in Syracuse for a little while.  We're in talks with...  We got things.  We got things going on.  We got things.  And before we decided on XM Satellite Radio, we could have gone back to commercial radio.  It's a fact. 
[00:34:00]  Yep.  So stop lying.  Just be honest with yourself and your listeners.  Stop lying.  He's got to spin it in his head.  He's got to spin it that he's the first show.  Somehow, someway.  It's like those records that aren't real records.  And like a movie.  That's what it is.  Movie records.  Right.  You know, it's always, hey, it's the highest grossing film ever.  Released on a Wednesday.  Before April Fool's Day.  Yeah, that's a comedy.  When the temperature was below 45 degrees.  Like there are a thousand films that are number one. 
[00:34:30]  What's number one, number one?  Because that's the one that counts.  But they spin it every week.  It's the number one film that starts with a vowel.  Yeah.  That's not starring Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  Look at Noah's ears just perked up.  He's puckered up, ready to put a big wet kiss on him.  And we didn't ruin our careers.  We ruined our careers for a little while.  But the fact is, if you really want to get into this, you know, the Sex for Sam thing just made us bigger.  A lot bigger. 
[00:35:00]  You know, we wouldn't have CBS This Morning coming in tomorrow if we never did the Sex for Sam thing.  Coming in this morning?  Tomorrow.  CBS This Morning coming in tomorrow.  Tomorrow's coming in this morning?  Tomorrow.  CBS.  You want to do an Abbott and Costello?  Fine.  But if he's coming in tomorrow, Abbott.  So these people that think that we blew up our careers, that we were – I was reading an old article the other day that said that we would never work in radio again. 
[00:35:30]  We would never work in radio again.  We were done, done, goodbye.  You'll never see those guys again.  They will never broadcast again.  They're unhirable.  All that BS.  The fact is, it made us even bigger.  Right.  And then we go on TV, make believe we're sorry, and go, yeah, we're sorry.  It was stupid.  It was morally wrong.  Because that's what they want to hear.  So we'll say that.  And then we move on, and now we're even bigger than we were.  That's the reality of what happened.  There you go.  All right.  Oh, yeah, break. 
[00:36:00]  By the way, I cranked up our mic volume.  I like that.  Because I'm trying to see what we could do on our end to help the audio levels.  And crank down the CD level.  That's what I did.  Yep.  So we're trying.  Let's give it a whirl.  But there's still other problems.  Of course there are.  They're not off the hook in D.C.  All right.  Really quick break, and we'll continue.  When you call this effing show, there are four words that you must know.  Learn to punch out. 
[00:36:30]  I'm punching out.  I'm punching out.  Punch down.  Punching out.  You're going to be great.  You ever do that angry?  Where are you going on?  Oh, yeah.  Ah, fuck.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  He shoots.  That's his.  ACC basketball.  It's the ACC today.  Tie your shoes nice and tight.  Because ACC basketball is breaking you down.  You better box your man out, because we're grabbing the boards. 
[00:37:00]  Ground ball, baby.  It's the ACC today on XM Satellite Radio.  Cut off the ricochet.  It's Thursday, the 27th of January, 2005.  I'm Ari Mykofsky with the ACC today.  A much-improved Virginia Tech team has most analysts scratching their heads and saying,  where did this come from?  Hokie head coach Seth Greenberg talks about the difference of this team this year from last year.  We're a very much different team this year than last year.  Last year, we relied so heavily on Brian Matthews, who had an unbelievable appetite to compete. 
[00:37:30]  And he kind of willed us to some of those wins at the end of the season last year.  And you understand, he was playing with three freshmen.  It was Brian Matthews and a sophomore.  And he was the one grizzled veteran.  You know, and he was kind of our go-to guy.  I mean, we ran our offense through him.  A year later, obviously, we're running our offense through our guards.  You know, we've got one senior in Carlos Dixon, who we also play at the power forward when we go small.  And, you know, Xavier Nadell and Jermon Gordon and Markey Cook and Witherspoon, 
[00:38:00]  two freshmen, two sophomores, that, you know, we really need them involved in our offense.  Now, playing in a conference with such heavy competition, coaches must step back for a second  and look at their counterparts on the other bench.  Wake Forest head coach Skip Prosser talks about Georgia Tech head coach Paul Hewitt.  Well, I think the most important thing is perspective.  I thought Coach Hewitt did a terrific job last year with his Georgia Tech team,  that when they would lose a game or so, he kept telling them and us and everybody else that would listen, 
[00:38:30]  they were a good team, they can continue to be good.  And they would be really good in March, and that's the way it played out.  And that's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.  10-202, The O.B. and Anthony Show.  What up?  Everybody say  When you hear the call, you've got to get it underway  What up? 
[00:39:00]  It's the cold word  No matter what you say  You're nowhere to be learned  You saw me  What?  You saw me  What are you doing?  I was just checking something  Now that the batteries are in there, I want to make sure it was working  Yeah, that's right  Maybe somebody tested it or didn't test it  Oh, boy  Thank you, Eric 
[00:39:30]  Thanks, Eric  Just tell Mars I can't click the phones from the mouse  No, I've got to do it this way today, I guess  Alright, let's try this  Alright, Mark, what's going on, man?  Hey, what's going on, y'all?  Hey  Jim Norton and friend  Hi, guy  Hey, uh  If Scott would have slept on your couch, O.P., it probably would have been scorch marks left there  But, uh  About five years ago  When I was driving over the road 
[00:40:00]  I was up in St. Louis  And I was stopped at a stop sign  And some guy on a big old Honda Goldwing  Just came flying out of nowhere  And just smashed right into the side of my truck  And he was to say  It scared the crap out of me  And gave me about a heart attack  He went flying over the hood of my truck  I got out  Come to find out  The guy was trying to kill himself  Because he's just  I guess his wife just left him  And took the kids  And he lost his job in the same day  And I was like, holy ass 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, so you've got to be involved in his problems  Yeah  Well, it pissed me off  Because I owned my own truck  It wasn't a company truck  So my insurance premiums went up  Because of this jackass  And I wound up losing the load  And wound up losing about $2,000 that week  So the guy  Try to commit suicide  And now you're involved  Yeah  Pretty much, yeah  That's just the worst  People  And got a nice bike too, man  I know there's people out there 
[00:41:00]  That are listening to this program  That'll eventually try to kill themselves  Yeah  Don't try to hurt others, please  That's the pussy's way out anyhow  Jump off a cliff  Cliff is good  And then if it's somewhere in the wilderness  Animals will eat you  There you go  Boy, that's a good one  Yeah  Alright, thank you  It'll be a great way for people to kill themselves  Buy yourselves like 10,000 copies of Yellow Discipline  And just leap off  What's Yellow Discipline?  Oh, no, no  It's just this little CD that's been bouncing around  Right  Is that your CD? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah  Might as well help someone out before you go  How much it hurts that CBS News will be here tomorrow  Opie and Anthony and favorite sidekick Rich Voss  Oh, no  Oh, man  That's right  We're going to purposely make sure Voss gets on the piece  Oh, no  Jimmy's not going to be here tomorrow  And what do you do for the radio program?  Well, I'm one of the guys  I'm here every morning  I'm here on a daily basis  Fell in 
[00:42:00]  I'm the staff comedian  He's so uncomfortable  His eyes will be wide  And he'll come off awkward  The acting  Oh, you know we purposely got to get him on tape now  Rich Voss  That's going to hurt  Opie and Anthony and Rich Voss  Have this to save out  Indecency  You pick a perfect day  What an ass  Have fun in Albany  Is it Albany this time around?  Yeah, I don't even want to plug in  I'm so depressed  It's not like, you know, a network 
[00:42:30]  A major network, too  A major network, television  It's not like it's News 12 or something  National  Nah, it's just a little show that I think everybody watches Sunday  When they wake up  They get their newspapers  And drink a cup of coffee  And watch Sunday morning  Well, there might be some cameras up there, too  Yeah, sure  Oh, yeah  Keep dreaming  Oh, boy  Should we even bother?  No way  Ah, you're not even trying with a hello  No way am I even attempting that one 
[00:43:00]  Nothing  All right, let's  One more call  And then we've got to play the Tsunami song  And get the latest on that  I think we've played it more than they played it  And no one's going to bother us  Because  Because now it's news  It's a news item  David in Mississippi, what's up?  We're outraged  Yeah, what's up?  First thing is first  I just want to give my shout-out to the kings of all radio  And I just want to back up a little bit 
[00:43:30]  And let you all know my crazy hours  Yeah  I go to sleep at 8 o'clock in the morning  And I wake up at 3 o'clock in the afternoon  And I got to be at work at 4  And I deliver a plane all over the station  Enough  That's what I want to hear  The guy's schedule  I got to give you a quick crash update too 
[00:44:00]  Because I saw Bob last night at the Comedy Cellar  And his manager's name is Matt Frost  And he said that he thought he heard that play  He was listening to the Pat from Munaki replay  And that car crash he heard  And he thought he was in an accident  So he pulled over  He thought somebody  He said he was so irritated  He wanted to hurl his accent up  Oh, we got a couple other things  That is funny  We have a couple other things we used to play on the old show  That we got to get  That's true  That just reminded me of something  Let me write myself a little note, Anthony  A little note  A little notes-ski  Oh, that was 
[00:44:30]  Yeah  That's a good one  And that one  I remember that one  And  Oh, oh, oh  That did a lot  And  No, I can't say anything  Okay, that's fine  One might be dated  You think?  Well, you got to keep them current  No, we'll get the current version of that  Yeah, okay  All right, should we play the Tsunami song  And then give the update?  Well, I personally am outraged at this song, Opie  I'm outraged  I am calling for the immediate dismissal of that program 
[00:45:00]  They've been taken off the air  Suspended indefinitely is what the news stories are saying  And they included the names of everybody  Mm-hmm  In the story  And we've been  We've been kind of  We've been kind of dragged into it  Do we have that one?  Yeah, well  It's even going to get  It's going to get worse than this, folks  But  We said it was going to involve us at some point  The suspended employees included Miss Jones  Miss Info  Miss Info got suspended also?  Yeah  She was the one that said she didn't want to be involved 
[00:45:30]  Right  She was against this thing  She got in a big argument with Miss Jones about not being involved in it  And they suspended her also?  Yeah  Why?  We got an audio of her yelling and screaming that she didn't want to be part of it  She's Asian and just thought she just wasn't into it  And they all yelled and jumped on her  And basically wanted her to leave the show for not supporting the entire morning show  She's Asian  Hey, didn't that guy also criticize her in his rap?  Didn't he say something about Miss Info or something like that?  No, no  He was praising her  Oh, he did? 
[00:46:00]  He praised her going  You go, Miss Info  You keep your head up  Ma  Or whatever he said  That was one of the worst raps I've ever heard, by the way, yesterday  Let's see  That's why you got to listen to the show every day  I mean, it's to that point  Because it's an ongoing soap opera  We don't need to replay the audio of them fighting, right?  No  Okay  So the suspended employees included Miss Jones  Miss Info  DJ Envy  Todd Lynn  Who we've seen at the Comedy Cellar many, many times  And producer Rick Delgado 
[00:46:30]  Former producer for the Opie and Anthony show  Alright  Rick  It has begun  You made the paper, Rick  It has begun  So then  I'm suspicious  I don't  I'm on the fence now  I don't know  I don't know if they're going to get fired, Anthony  I just don't know  I would think  I think they are going to get fired  You know something?  This is funny  This is exactly what happens when we get in trouble  Opie starts calling me up going  I don't know  You think we're going to skate this one? 
[00:47:00]  I think we might be okay  And I'm the one going  No, Opie  We are fired  So fired  Completely fired  Yeah, you're usually better at that than I  I'm seeing this as the pressure's mounting  This hasn't blown over yet  It's one of these things where  Now there's going to be a press conference demonstration  Tomorrow  With  They got his name up here?  Yeah, councilman from Queens  John Liu  He's going to be out there 11 o'clock  Tomorrow morning  In front of Hot 97 
[00:47:30]  Protesting and having a press conference  That's bad  That's bad  That's bad  This guy's not going to let this go  Did you ever hear of John Liu?  Democrat from Queens?  No, he's taking advantage of this as well  Never heard of him before  You're not going to hear from him after  So he's going to use this  To keep his name in the news  That's why he's having a press conference tomorrow  Why didn't he have it today?  This is his Tawana Brawley  Right  There you go  Of course  His big cause  So he's going to be out there  And he's not going to be happy  Until they're fired 
[00:48:00]  And you know what radio stations do  They make these little guys  These little jerk-offs happy  Right  By booting shows out the door  It also is saying in the latest article on this  MS Radio president Rick Cummings  Called it morally and socially indefensible  All involved, myself included  Are ashamed and deeply sorry  Little known fact  Rick Cummings, Howard  Was in discussions with Anthony and I  About doing a little something-something  Yeah, how about that? 
[00:48:30]  So you could keep claiming that we were unhirable  And that we're done on commercial radio  If that's what you want to believe  Anyway, you want to play the song?  I can never get enough of this song  It's an outrage  It's an outrage because it's just awful  It is an awful song parody  There's no rhyming  It doesn't really stay true to the original  Look, we're, you know  We're not going to claim to be innocent here 
[00:49:00]  We, you know  But  We've penned some pretty awful song parodies  I would have never played this on our show  No  It's just not good  I would have  We would have listened to this  You and I  Like we do on a daily basis  And said  You know what  It's just  Eh  Try again  Yeah  We would have said probably  Try again  Or if someone else wrote it and sent it in  You mean?  We probably would have played it and gone  Oh, this is just horrible  This is just a bad parody  And there are a bunch of pussies over there  Because they have no problem saying chinks in the song  Yeah  But then they say African Americans 
[00:49:30]  Africans  Why didn't you say niggers?  No  Why didn't you say niggers?  Because that's a derogatory term  You guys are so brave  Why not?  Right  But you have no problem saying chinks  Chinks  Yeah  You're going to use racial slurs  Fill the song up with them  We would have  Right  We would have  Even if we were black  Really?  Yeah  Let me think about that  I would not be a party to this show if I was black  I would be hanging out with you racists  So here's the song 
[00:50:00]  And then we got some O'Reilly comments  And then we'll move on from this  Bill O'Reilly made some comments  I'm sure he's  I'm sure he's defending them  I give the morning team a lot of credit  Everyone's talking about them  But I don't know  You say they're definitely fired  I say definitely they will be fired  I think they're still weighing their options right now  Seeing if they could weather this storm  The only reason they're not fired yet  Is the station itself  And upper management 
[00:50:30]  Are having discussions on who they're going to put in there  How they're going to spin this  When they do fire them  Contractually  What are they obligated to pay these people  All that kind of stuff  The decision's already made  They are gone  It is made already  The only delay is logistics  That's it  I've seen this too many times  So when they get fired  Yeah  That's when we will definitely enter the story  Yeah  Other shock jocks that got fired for doing stupid things 
[00:51:00]  Oh the Fox will call us and want us to comment on what it's like  You get fired  Blah blah blah  Good old Neil Cavuto will be calling again  Yeah  Neil Cavuto wants us on his show so bad to talk about this crap  What are we going to say  Donnie Deutsch will call up again  Yeah  Can you re-tape your interview now that the one you did is old  Yeah  You watch the CBS morning show when they come in and interview us  That's going to be probably a big part of what they talk about  Probably  That's a little coming in Monday  We'll go 
[00:51:30]  Yeah  No  Tomorrow  Tomorrow  When Rich Voss is filling in for Jimmy Norton  That's great  We're going to  We're going to  We're going to want to  Have an intellectual discussion on the FCC  And the tsunami song  And the repercussions  And they'll be  Oh that was stupid  I wouldn't use chinks like they did  I would use it in a different way  That droopy jaw is going to mess it up for everybody  He really will  His awful political opinions  Dude the FCC is full of liberals  Yeah that's what it is 
[00:52:00]  Good point  Did you see my Star of David tattoo  Did you put that on the news  We always argue like  You know you know how I feel about the left  They annoy me  But let's be honest  The FCC is a conservative right now  The conservatives are bad on censorship  You know the left is annoying  And we'll argue this  And they'll go no the liberals are worse  I'm like the parents television council  Is 99% of it  He's like no they're liberals  Tree huggers  The reality is the FCC is a pain in the ass  But you know if you have any talent doing a radio show 
[00:52:30]  You learn how to work around it  There you go  And Anthony and I have always worked around it  For 10 years now  And a company's never officially paid a fine  Because of something we did  They did pay that fine for a lot of incidents  Yeah it was like all the infinity stuff  Us lumped in with a Howard violation  But it was never proven that we were guilty of what we did  Convicted?  No never convicted  Is that a technicality you think?  Yeah  You really think so?  I think it's  They would have never found us guilty of that 
[00:53:00]  I think it's a little rationalizing  But the truth of the matter is  Yeah it was never one of those  Pay this fine for what they said  Alright we'll pay the fine  People were outraged  But you can't fine us  Because the sentence  He's doing the balloon knot  Made it on the air  And that's what it comes down to  You just can't  That's not what the FCC is about  You just can't  No  Language wise that broadcast was fine  Here's the awful awful song  Alright let's listen  And as a news program we're allowed to play it  So we can comment on how awful this is 
[00:53:30]  I'm disgusted  The lack of talent  Featuring Rick Delgado  Former producer of the Opie and Anthony program  He's the one singing with all his heart  Singing his balls off  They're so bad at singing too  This  This crew  You know I love the kids  There was a time 
[00:54:00]  When the sun was shining bright  So I went down to the beach  To catch me a tan  Then the next thing I knew  A wave twenty feet high  Came and washed  Your whole country away  Makes me laugh every time  When people kick in  And all at once  You could hear the screaming chains 
[00:54:30]  Ouch  And no one  Was safe  From the wave  There were Africans drowning  Little Chinaman swept away  You could hear God laugh and swim  You bitches swim  Oh they quoted that one all week  So now you're screwed  It's the tsunami  You better run or kiss your ass awake 
[00:55:00]  Go find your mommy  I just saw a flow by  A tree went through a head  And now your children will be sold  Child slavery  So now you're screwed 
[00:55:30]  Now you're screwed  It's a tsunami  It's a tsunami  You better run or kiss your ass awake  Go find your mommy  Can't find my mommy  I just saw a flow by  A tree went through a head 
[00:56:00]  And now your children will be sold  In child slavery  Oh please  Please love the kids  I'll pay for all the kids  The little Indonesian kids  The little Asian kids  The Chinese kids  The black  Well not the black kids  But the white kids  The Puerto Rican kids  I love them more  I'll pay for everything  I promise  I won't touch them  Bubbles  Come on let's get these kids  No one's upset that he's making  Michael Jackson pedophile allegations  Please help us out  Tsunami  We're coming to help you  All you kids 
[00:56:30]  We love you  What a bad parody  It's just bad right  The singing is awful  There's no rhyming  No format  It's just awful  It's so bad  But we really enjoy playing  It really got stuck in your head  The tune though  So then  This is the official statement  From MS Broadcasting  Alright  It's Hot 97  The official number one station 
[00:57:00]  For hip hop and R&B  My name is Ebro  And  603  The Miss Jones Morning Show  Has been suspended indefinitely  Due to  The content  Of  The Tsunami song  And it's bad taste  They've been suspended indefinitely  We'll be taking your phone calls  Anything that you would like to talk about 
[00:57:30]  We'll get it on this morning  If you're upset  About the song  About the song's content  We'll get that on this morning  That's what we're here for  It's Hot 97  We also have a song  From the rapper  Jin  Coming at this radio station  Coming at it  False sincerity by the way  And that's what hip hop is about  It is  So Jin will have his opportunity  In his song  To express how he feels 
[00:58:00]  This guy makes me puke  That's such false sincerity  He doesn't give a crap  That the morning show  Was suspended  He probably supports them  But his role now  Is to  Go on the air  And sound really  Really  Sincere  That this was a bad thing  And  You know  And take a lot of phone calls  People yelling and screaming  About how awful the song was  Even though most of the people  That will call in 
[00:58:30]  Never heard the song  By the way  True  That is  That is such  Fake sincerity  I've never heard  Fake or sincerity  In my life  Rev from  Whackbag  Shane  After hearing it a few times  I think Miss Jones  Was trying to dodge a bullet  With some of the lyrics  Her line  There were Africans drowning  Sounded so forced in there  You think maybe she would  Put that line in there  Because like  Look  See  Where we're  Making fun of  Our own people too  Possible  Because I remember hearing  About a lot of Africans 
[00:59:00]  Unless one of them  Is one of those  Places on the continent of Africa  I don't even  Yeah it was  Oh what  Alright  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  There were a couple of  Countries that got  Got some of the tsunami  In Africa  God bless Hot 97  They're taking advantage  Of the situation  You know  And they're running with it  But you know  Get a guy that's a better actor  That guy could care less  Better actor  Like Rich Voss  Right  Guy could care less  I'm outraged  A lot of people  Were outraged  And uh  We'll be um 
[00:59:30]  Taking your calls  And you could express  Your feelings  Because that's what  Hip hop is all about  Shut up  That's what hip hop's all about  It's absolutely not  What it's about  Jesus  I thought it was about  Like  A bunch of guys  Driving around in big  SUVs with the windows tinted  Throwing their guns  In the gun traps  When the cops pull them over  And shooting people  In front of  Automotive museums  And in Vegas  Isn't that what it's about 
[01:00:00]  In the end  It's just music  Right  Let's calm down  It's just music  It may have  Came from a place  Where they're talking about  Their neighborhoods  And the streets  And stuff  But most of the rappers  Out today  They're so removed  From their  You know  Past environment  It's not even funny  It's about a lot of anger  There's racism  There's sexism  Violence  That seems to me  What hip hop is all about  You know  All the really good  Hip hop songs  The popular ones 
[01:00:30]  The ones that people remember  Are really about  Awful things  Hip hop is about  The booty  The booty  It's about the booty  It's about the booty  And it's about the bling  And  And that's about it  Killing cops  Was a pretty popular subject  A few years back  I used to love listening to NWA  And ghetto boys  It's not about being polite  And that was really hardcore  You know  It's not apologetic  At all  Or pandering 
[01:01:00]  No  That's what it's all about  Not getting the community together  And helping  Just stop it  Stop  It's angry  Like when you hear  Like Will Smith man  Like sometimes  Like girls of the world  That guy would come at you man  Like whoa  Getting jiggy with it  Yeah  Wow  Nah nah nah nah nah  He was very hardcore  Getting jiggy with it  Way to pick a current song  You idiot  I would have to lunge  And turn the volume down  Because I didn't want  Any kids hearing that  There may be a better example  Of maybe a song  That came out  In the last like decade  Who knows  Jesus 
[01:01:30]  It's like Jimmy's gonna know  I know  It's just funny to hear  You hear that though  You'd be afraid  He was gonna break into your house  And knit an afghan  With your grandmother  Yuck  Alright  Bill O'Reilly  You know that  Too legit to quit  Why don't you get a current song  Like that  Well you said  Get jiggy with it  I just said  Well I said  Girls of the world  I really am an ass  That was when I was still drinking  Back in like 86  And he actually changed the lyrics  By the way  That it used to be  I hit it with a trash can  And ran like hell  And then he changed it  To like  So then I handed her my wallet  And ran like hell  Of course he changed it 
[01:02:00]  Alright well  Here's Bill O'Reilly  Last night  Bill O'Reilly  Robert Reeves  Ocean Springs, Mississippi  I found that radio parody  Of the tsunami victims  Disgusting  It amazes me  That a hip hop station  Would create  Such a racist song  Christy Petty  Johnsburg, Illinois  Bill I think the idiots  Who created this song  Are very wrong  However being a fool  Isn't against the law  Chris Hall  At Salt Lake City, Utah  I agree that there should be limits  To what you broadcast  On the public airways  But whom do I trust  To monitor that  Not the government 
[01:02:30]  Christine Loft  In Greenfield, Indiana  As Asians  My mother and I  Were deeply offended  By the song  Those involved  Should get fired  Deeply offended  You never heard the song  You might have heard  A quick clip  On the news  Read a transcript  Which is even worse  When they put it on the screen  With the quotes  And you gotta read  On CNN  Screaming chinks  And know that  Rick Delgado's pen  Wrote that  But it was like 
[01:03:00]  What is this obsession  People have with  Silencing what they don't like  It's like when  When Ice-T Sound  Sang Cop Killer  I thought it was an awful song  And it was rude  And vicious  And I'm very pro-cop  But I didn't want him  For one reason  One minute  Not to be able to have it  Played on the radio  Or not be able to sell his  Or want him in trouble for it  A lot of people did though  A lot of people came out  Against that one  Absolutely  But I disagreed with them  It's like you can't censor  What somebody says man  It's unpopular speech  Has to be protected  I'm sorry  Right  Absolutely  Of course  But the difference is  When you work for a radio station 
[01:03:30]  It's their decision  It's management's decision  Whether they want that type of material  On their station  So it really  It really doesn't come down  To a freedom of speech issue  They do have the freedom  To play that song  To voice that  But it's the station's  Prerogative to fire them  You're right  What I'm saying is  This obsession people have  With wanting it silenced  Right, right  Like that's what bothers me  Is people who say  They're offended by  I never have wanted anybody  To not be able to say  What they want on the radio 
[01:04:00]  There's never been a song  That I was so offended by  I didn't want to play  And I don't think  For a minute  That management  Wanted them fired  Because of  The content of that song  It's the pressure  From these people  That you're talking about  That want this  All nice and milk toasty  You know  The reality  A lot of people talk about  The FCC these days  You know  When I'm sitting here  Doing a radio show  With you guys  What I worry about  Is not the FCC anymore  I just don't  We understand  And obviously  We're on satellite  But even if we're on commercial  I don't worry about the FCC 
[01:04:30]  As much as I worry about  The company  That we're working for  Right  Because in the end  They're going to be the ones  That destroy our careers again  It's not going to be the FCC  It's going to be  You know  Some bigwigs  And you know  I have to say  Because we're here now  But XM satellite  Is going to have a problem  With something we do  It's going to snowball  And next thing you know  We're going to get fired  Because it's too much  Of a hassle to keep us  Pressure from small groups  It's not going to be the FCC  It's just not  Nope  You know  People are focusing  On the wrong thing  If you're talented in radio 
[01:05:00]  You could do a radio show  And keep the FCC  Out of your hair  But you've got to worry  About the bigger issue  Which is you know  These huge corporations  That you know  Own the station you work at  You say something  A little racially insensitive  Sexist  Homophobic  Things like that  That's the stuff  That gets you in trouble now  Right  It's not the cursing  It's not the sexual content  Because you know  Quite frankly  We could say whatever we want  As far as that's concerned  Right  But you start getting people 
[01:05:30]  Getting very sensitive  When it comes to their race  And religion  Things like that  Yeah the reality is  These guys should not be fired  Or well  I mean  We were just  What I want to say was  It's not an FCC issue  Basically  It's not an FCC issue  They shouldn't be fired  Because you know  This is against the FCC  The FCC will stay out of this  Because there's nothing there  They should be fired  Because that song stinks  There you go  Get a show that has  A little more talent  Jesus  Like LL Cool J said  Back when he did radio  Oh boy  Yeah  Alright why don't we  Step aside 
[01:06:00]  We're going old school  Into break Anthony  Old school  You're keeping it real Opie  Let's go Casey Kasem  Your hip hop  Casey Kasem  The outtakes  Hi  Let's take a listen to this  Faux pas  And we'll continue  The countdown will begin  This Sunday afternoon  At one  Right here on the radio station  You grew up with  Music radio 138  Oh fuck  What the hell's going on here  Geez well  Isn't it the last hour  We got another hour to do  Geez I thought we were almost finished  Good

[01:07:00]  In Cincinnati Ohio  And here's what he writes  Dear Casey  This may seem to be  A strange dedication request  But I'm quite sincere  And it'll mean a lot  If you play it  Recently there was a death  In our family  He was a little dog  Named Snuggles  But he was most certainly  A part of  Let's start again  From coming out of the record  Play the record okay  Please  See when you come out  Of those up-tempo  God damn numbers man  It's impossible 
[01:07:30]  To make those transitions  And then you gotta go  Into somebody dying  You know they do this  To me all the time  I don't know what  The hell they do it for  But god damn it  If we can't come out  Of a slow record  I don't understand it  Is Don on the phone  Okay  I want a god damn  Concerted effort  To come out of a record  That isn't a fucking  Up-tempo record  Every time I do  A god damn death dedication  Now make it  And I also want to know  What happened to the pictures  I was supposed to see  This week  This is the god  Last god damn time  I want somebody  To use his fucking brain 
[01:08:00]  To not come out  Of a god damn record  That is  That's up-tempo  And I gotta talk  About a fucking dog  Dying  The Opie and Anthony  Show award  For most disturbing  Phone call  Goes to  Donkey sausage  What the  Do me one favor  What cuddles  Why don't you get  Some whore  Into your studio  And have her  Shit on the plate  And put it in the microwave  And then have her  Roll around in that  Screaming donkey sausage  Donkey sausage  Raquel  That would be me  You want to shit 
[01:08:30]  On a plate for us  Okay  And then run around  Saying what  Donkey sausage  Donkey sausage  Dude, Jim and Dean's  Donkey sausage  I can do that  I can do that  Donkey sausage  Donkey sausage  Donkey sausage  I like it  There's something oddly  Attractive about that  That's gotta be a promo  The Opie and Anthony  Show  Oh, nice  Only 35 days  Until spring training  And XM Satellite Radio  Is counting down  To the opening  Of the 2005  Baseball season  With some of the  Greatest play-by-play

[01:10:30]  Do you feel like you  Like followed Opie and Anthony  Because they went to XM first  No I don't feel that way at all  I feel that 
[01:11:00]  I am the first guy  In broadcast radio  To walk away  From a very  Very highly paid position  And a huge audience  And voluntarily  Go to satellite  I mean I think  I think in the case  Of Opie and Anthony  They did themselves in  On commercial radio  They are unhirable  I mean what they did  Was pretty awful  You can't go into a church  And encourage people  To have sex  There was a desperation  About it  And that's what happens  To a lot of guys  I mean I was just reading  On Power 
[01:11:30]  You know what  Right  He's so delusional  There was a desperation  Yeah  We were so desperate  We were on in about  20 cities  Number one in most of them  And we were so desperate  That we decided  Hey let's blow it up  And get a couple  To have sex  At St. Pass Cathedral  They're so desperate  He's so dishonest  It's ridiculous  And now he's saying  He's the first  To go voluntarily  Right  First voluntarily  Voluntarily  They didn't go voluntarily  They had no choice 
[01:12:00]  I went voluntarily  So I'm the first  We had a lot of choices  My question is too  He says that  I'm leaving a very lucrative  Radio career  But it's like  Dude you're walking  Into a hundred million  A year at Sirius  Yeah yeah  He's leaving  A very lucrative  Yeah I'm leaving  A very lucrative deal  I'm walking into  A more lucrative deal  Exactly  Jackass  A hundred million a year  I broadcast  Out of my grandmother's  Underpants  This guy lies  On a daily basis  And every time he lies  I will bring it up  On this program  That's hysterical 
[01:12:30]  And he's trying to claim  What we did  Was so awful  Really  Really  Why don't you go  Google Howard Stern's name  And see about  All the awful things  He has done  In his radio career  Things that I guarantee  Are a lot worse  Than a stupid couple  Allegedly having sex  At St. Pat's Cathedral  Okay  A lot worse  Now he's claiming that  Oh you know  Such an awful thing  Really?  How he's been a saint  His whole life  Yeah  Never wished AIDS  On a family 
[01:13:00]  Of a general manager  No  His track record  Speaks for itself  It's just funny  That he would  Go down that road  Trying to claim  How awful  It was  What we did  Never made jokes  About an airliner  Crashing in Washington  He'll deny that  I remember listening  To the show  You know  That is an urban legend  I remember listening  To that show  And he did joke about it  What happened there  How about his apology  In Spanish  To Selena fans 
[01:13:30]  Ugh  I think that was probably  To prevent Mexicans  From shooting him  Absolutely was  They were ready  To kill him  It was a whole bunch  Of people  A whole group of people  That were ready  To kill him  For that Selena thing  And he had to go on  And it's just  You know  Little things like that  Little  There's a whole bunch  Of them  So shut up  As far as saying  How awful we are  For what we did  Relax  Jim from Tennessee  What's up  How's it going guys  Hey  How's it going 
[01:14:00]  Bibi bitch  Hi Jim  How are you  That was rather  Insulting and unnecessary  Just wonderful  It's not what this  Program's about  Cavuto was reporting  This morning  That Sirius  Is going to merge  With  Or is looking  Into plans  To merge  With XM  Due to their  Financial problems  Of hiring  Howard and Mel  That story  That story  Hit the New York  Post yesterday  That there may be  Merger discussions  Between XM  And Sirius  That's why we're 
[01:14:30]  Going to Washington  On Sundays  To sit in on  Some of these  Discussions with  Sirius  And then Mel  Carmisen  During his  Conference call  Yesterday  Claimed that  These rumors  Are false  But of course  That's what he's  Going to say  No matter what  Yeah  So I really  Don't know  Where that is  At  Probably yet  Another lie  Probably started  By Howie  Well to be  Honest with you  Dude  When I talked  To Mel  This week  He didn't  Mention it  Like we were  Just basically  Talking about  Chicks  And we're  Watching  We'll do  Mel and I  We'll get on  The phone  Watch videos  Together  And like  Comment on 
[01:15:00]  The chicks  And he's  Like look  At her tits  And I'm  Like what  About the  Serious  Things  Like ah  Come on  I can't  Tell you  That  What you  Ought to do  Is name  Your little  Mouth  Mr.  Jangles  I gotta name  It after a  Dead person  Because it's  Dead  No  It's  Well  Did he die  Well did  Mr.  Jangles  Die too  What's his name  Michael  Whatever it was  In the Green  Mile  Yeah I know  He didn't  To heal him  Alright 
[01:15:30]  Dude I was  Trying to go  With you  Mr.  Jangles  And John  Coffey  Was the guy  Who healed  Everybody  John Coffey  By the way  I've been  Trying to  Hang up  On him  For about  30 seconds  But we  Can't hang  Up with  The mouse  Today  I sure  Would like  Some of  That corn  Bread  Yeah  Do you know  Who was up  For that role  By the way  Who actually  Got a callback  For that role  As well as  Getting a callback  For Fat Albert  Patrice  Got a callback  And I'm like  How did they go  John Coffey  Fat Albert  I can understand  Patrice is a big guy  Yeah  But John Coffey  Was like  The guy they got  Would look like  An NFL linebacker 
[01:16:00]  Like a big muscular guy  And Patrice  Who is a big fellow  Hasn't lifted weight  Since 1985  When he was a junior  In high school  Clumsy fat ass  He really thinks  He's up for this part  Of this strapping  Bodyguard type murderer  That is hysterical  That Patrice is on TV  A lot  Always as a convict  The guy plays  More convicts  In TV shows  Than I've ever seen  Or bouncers at the door  Patrice is the king  Of bouncers  The bouncer role  Always  He gets the bouncer role too  I'll tell you  If you need someone 
[01:16:30]  To go  Let me see your ID  No one does it better  Than Patrice O'Neal  Or walk in the background  When someone's on  One of those phones  Through the plexiglass  In the prison  He's like walking  In the background  You go  Hey what  I think that's Patrice  So this is from yesterday  Anthony  Really fast  Satellite radio rivals  Sirius and XM  Have been  Cozying up to each other  The Post has learned  The business section  Is usually pretty accurate  By the way  Yeah  I hate to say  I mean  The New York papers  The New York Post  And the Daily News  They're joke papers 
[01:17:00]  Basically  Mel's denied it  But you're saying  Maybe that they just  It's one of those things  Well of course he's going to deny it  He's not going to go  Okay you got me  You know  Of course  Normally they keep quiet  About these things  And don't have a comment  But he actually came out  And commented that  They're not talking  And then it says  While talks have not  Advanced far  Executives from both sides  Have been meeting lately  To discuss the possibility  Of a merger  According to several sources  Close to the matter  So you know  Maybe they're exploring it  I don't know  What does that mean  To us though man  I don't know 
[01:17:30]  Where we stand with Mel  I mean if he wants  To be really vindictive  And then the two companies merge  What did we ever do to Mel  I don't know  That's what I'm asking  I don't think we ever did  Anything to Mel  I went on record  And said that  I have nothing bad  To say about the guy  I defy you  To find one bad thing  We ever said  About Mel Karmazin  What's Mel going to do  Fire you guys  I dare you Mel  Right  I dare you  Go ahead  Try it  I mean it would take  A long time  For a merger  To actually happen  Even if it was going to 
[01:18:00]  So  Wouldn't it be funny  If the talk started  Because the very first time  Those guys ever talked  Was in Vegas at the CES  Over some silly incident  I kind of like that guy  Hey  Shut up  We should hang out  Louder  Louder  We can't hear in the back  You moron  Wow we're blasting  Everyone out  Sorry  I'm really watching  The meters today  And I think we might have  Blasted everyone out  Riding more levels 
[01:18:30]  By yelling  Shut up  Why do you have to yell  He's just whispering  All your minds  Just go quietly  Oh yeah  I gotta go here  Is he gonna fix this though  Bob on Long Island  What's up Bob  What's going on  Hey Bob  What's going on  Hey I heard  I was listening to  Scott and Todd yesterday  They were talking about  The Hot 97  Saying it's disgusting  It's ridiculous  And then they were like  Oh and the other guys  Talking about  What is that  Governor Cody from Jersey  Talking about him 
[01:19:00]  They're like  Oh yeah  The other guy's  Talking about him  And his crazy wife  Putting babies  In a microwave  And stuff like that  They probably mean  The Jersey guys  Dude  Not us  Yeah  What's that  I think the guys  They mean  I don't know  What they're called  But they're in  New Jersey  On 101.5  Or something  Oh they're getting  Some air time  Yeah  I don't know  You know  Remember that  Conversation you guys  Had a while back  About how crazy  His wife was  Right  Yeah  We have audio  Of it  But I'm saying  I think that he's  This time talking  About the Jersey  Because the Jersey  Governor had a problem  With him  Well it is a fact 
[01:19:30]  He was just going  Like the other guys  You know  I figured he was  Talking about you guys  Yeah but no  Did he say the other guy  Did he say O&A  Or did he say Jersey  No no  Jimmy is going to  Prolong this  Just to aggravate you  But he made a reference  Of the satellite radio  Oh  Thank you Bob  We had the audio  And I know he  Had referred to that  Thank you Bob  Thank you Bob  Welcome  Thank you  Jimmy is such a prick  Yeah another guy  That we used to  Work on the same  Radio station with  Is in trouble  We know for a fact  The Jersey guys 
[01:20:00]  You know I'll tell you  This much  Because we do  Try to be very honest  On this program  When Howard talks  About people  Ripping them off  And clothing  And stuff  That is a reality  In radio  There are a lot  Of guys that  Will not come up  With their own stuff  Will surf the internet  Will listen to other  Radio shows  And just blatantly  Copy what they're doing  That is a fact  Our whole argument  With Howard  Was no way  Is he going to  Is he going to  Paint us as one  Of those radio shows  No effing way  Okay  But it does happen 
[01:20:30]  All the time  There's a bunch of  Hacks in this business  That they feel like  It's a radio show  That's not heard  In my area  And they're doing  This cool bit  We're just going  To take that bit  It is a reality  Okay  And these guys  The Jersey guys  They flat out  Take a lot of elements  From our radio show  And just do it  On their show  And then  A bunch of our listeners  Have gotten through  To their program  And they're like  Yo  Opie and Anthony  Came up with  The silent game  Which we did  And Opie and Anthony  Came up with this 
[01:21:00]  And that  It's stuff that  We could easily  Prove we came up with  It didn't come  From anywhere else  And they're like  Oh no no  It's cool  Because we're kind of  Friends with those guys  And it's cool  It's cool  It's not cool  That's what they say  They use  They use the ping pong  Sound effect for callers  They use the bowling  Sound effect for callers  They have a train  It's not the one we use  But something along those lines  And they use a lot of  The same movie drops  That we use  Yeah  The same movie drops  Oh my god  God forbid  Someone else uses movies  I mean  You know  Then you gotta  You can't get too picky 
[01:21:30]  I mean movie drops  Are you know  A lot of shows use them  And you know  It's the obvious ones  You're not gonna play  A bad movie clip right  You guys play some pretty  Obscure ones though man  You don't go with  The obvious in a lot of them  You have  Hello exactly  There's no one else  In the country playing it  Hello exactly  There's no one playing that  But you guys  Guarantee  You will be molested  Right  And we're constantly  Updating our entire show  Our movie drops  Everything so  But you know  This guy Craig  You know  Whatever  Good luck to you  But you are a hack 
[01:22:00]  You know it  You know you're a hack  You were a hack  When you were at NEW  You couldn't get it going  And you're a hack  A hack is like  The worst thing  To be called  He's a hack  Who wants to be a hack  He's a hack  He's a floating shineman  So he's getting  A lot of attention today  New Jersey Governor  Al Sock Jock  Who calls my wife crazy  New Jersey Governor  Richard Cody  This is something  That was brought up  On our show  That's why I'm very 
[01:22:30]  Suspicious by the way  Jimmy brought this audio  In a while ago  And no one else  Was playing it  It was just something  That Jim picked up on  New Jersey Governor  Richard Cody  Yesterday came out  Swinging at a shock jock  Who suggested on the air  That the state's first lady  Was crazy  Because she once suffered  From postpartum depression  This is the exact break  We did  We played the audio  And she is crazy  She's out of her mind  The stuff she was saying  That bitch is nuts  Do we have the audio?  She's nuts  Here  This is the audio  By the way  Listen to some of this  This is the news piece 
[01:23:00]  What news piece is this?  The where Jimmy got the audio  Oh, okay, alright  Oh, it's a long one  Where's the short clips?  We couldn't find it  We only had the wrong one  Can you fast forward through it  Because it was just her  Talking about certain  It's a story of near tragedies  And everyday triumphs  She overcame homicidal thoughts  About her firstborn son  Suicidal thoughts about herself  And found understanding doctors  And a husband  All of whom appeared to work  No less than a miracle  Poor bastards  How about Kevorkian?  I felt like I was some kind of monster 
[01:23:30]  I had a scary thought  About putting the baby in the microwave  And I'm done  She sat down in her living room  With her husband  See, that's a crazy woman talking  Sorry  And then how does the governor handle it?  I'll punch you in the face  There's a healthy couple  Running New Jersey  Why are you?  She wants to murder the baby  And I'll punch anybody  Who decides to criticize her  I've been acting Governor Dick Cody  To share with me  Her lifelong journey through depression  Earlier, we heard about  This school teacher's own humiliations  From her third grade teacher  About how she first  Recognized her depression 
[01:24:00]  And how she was willing  To give up her child  But medications  Turned that around  For Mary Jo Cody  For a while  And then they failed her  And I had the baby  Down below me  In the water  And I thought  I could drown him  In a minute  And I thought to myself  I've had it again  I'm done  And I decided  The hospital didn't work for me  I'm going to commit suicide  But she  That's the governor's wife  And she almost  She was going to drown  The baby  I wouldn't mind her as much  If she wanted to kill  The little cop  But at least speak properly  You South Jersey idiot 
[01:24:30]  Going to drown the baby  Are you?  I didn't even notice  That she mispronounced  I was going to  I was going to  Stabbed the baby  And then threw him  Out the window  Idiot  I was just waiting  For her to say  God almighty  How long has Cody  Been married to Voss?  I was going to drown her  I was hoping  She was going to say  I put the baby  Put the baby  In the microwave  She puts the baby  In the microwave  She does this  When she's told 
[01:25:00]  Run to her doctor  One more time  So then she said  Well let me try you  On one more  Antidepressant  Called an MAO inhibitor  And she said  I didn't want to  Recommend it for you  Because it has  Dangerous side effects  You could get a stroke  And then two weeks later  I started giving Kevin  A bath  And I didn't have  A scary thought  I thought  This is kind of amazing  That I could give him  A bath  And I could feed him  And I don't worry  About smothering him  It came  Yeah you're not nuts  What a line  Could you imagine  Wow 
[01:25:30]  You're just a little  Todd have no idea  What's going on  In mommy's head  As you're just trying  To figure it all out  You're just  You're herking  And jerking  On your back  Like a little band  And she's like  Proud that she didn't  Kill you  Holy hell  I didn't kill him  When Cody  When Cody comes home  From work  Does he go  How was your day  Honey I bathed the baby  And I didn't want  To murder it  Oh  Give us a hug  You know the husband  Just leaves the house  Every day going  Oh my god  What am I going  To come home to  Is this the day  I get the phone call  Is this the day 
[01:26:00]  I come home  The baby's drowned  And my wife  Has a knife through her chest  Can I make one point  To the next day  Oh you're going to  Yeah we're going to  Get back into that  In a second  Wow  We're just trying  To get through  Some of this audio  What a kook  She is a kook  She is absolutely a nut  You're the innocent  Little babies  Smiling up at your mom  Your loving mom  And she has thoughts  Like this in her head  Wonderful  It came down  To trial and error  With various drugs  By his first birthday 
[01:26:30]  I was looking forward  To giving him a party  So it came about  It wasn't like  One day I woke up  And I wasn't depressed  It was like  The thoughts started to fade  And when the thoughts  Started to fade  Then I started to feel  Like I deserved a baby  And that's how  The depression  Kind of faded out  She would have  A second child  Christopher  Going off drugs  But taking shock therapy  To tide her over  The last days  Of his pregnancy  Oh my god  Shock therapy  Maybe you shouldn't  Have a second kid 
[01:27:00]  Just my opinion  Yeah right  If you had thoughts  Of killing the first one  And know that  In order to have  The second one  You've got to go  Off your drugs  Right  Perhaps you should  Just not  Have a god damn kid  Might not be the best thing  And get shocked  Who does she hang out  With a six foot five  Indian who doesn't  Talk to anyone  You want to watch  The game  You want to watch  The ball game  Do you governor  Just put your hand up  Show her you can do it  Oh man 
[01:27:30]  God  I'm glad we have  The long form audio  I haven't heard all this  She is a kook  She's a kook  You are a kook  Yeah because having  Another child  Isn't going to  Add stress into your life  No  And now she has  More choices  Do I kill the first one  Or the second one  That's it  She's got a butcher knife  Eeny meeny  Miney moe  Well that is an advantage  Though because  If you get mad  And you drown one  You can just like  Show the other one  To the husband  And hope he doesn't  Notice that one's missing  Still got one  Yeah  Just never have him 
[01:28:00]  In the same room  At the same time  Cody hit rock bottom  When she talked about  Putting her firstborn  In a microwave  Or drowning him  In the pool  Listen to how  Her depression  Changed on her  Just a couple of years ago  And it got worse  And worse as the days  Went on  And I just  I just told my psychiatrist  I called him up  And I said  I just  I'm not making it  I can't face the day  So she upped my  She upped my  Antidepressants  Too much  And I had seizures 
[01:28:30]  And then I went  Into a coma  She was rushed  To the hospital  Her husband  Joining her soon after  And so when I got there  I would best describe it  The scene  In the room  As the actress  Kicking the plug  Out of the wall  Without cursing  And she was violent  Screaming  Yeah  Couldn't understand  What she was saying  Her eyes weren't focused  Anywhere  Anyplace  On any person  Help me  Written in her stomach  And there was six people  Trying to hold her down  And they were having  A tough time  Doing that  Hot  We eventually got 
[01:29:00]  An open vein  Into her  Put all the drugs  That we pumped into her  Couldn't calm her body  And the physician said  Total recall  In the chair  I've got to put her  In her coma  Otherwise she's  Going to lose some oxygen  To the brain  There's going to be  Permanent brain damage  After seven days  An anesthesiologist  Finally came up  With a drug scheme  That held promise  Her eyes opened  But didn't focus  On anyone  And she's listening  We'll try for about  Two hours  You know  Talk to her  Give her commands 
[01:29:30]  And the sweat  Was pouring off  Myself  And him  And the nurses  In the room  And  Oh  Getting a little  Choked up  He said  Do you love me  He said  Do you love me  No  You didn't say  Your head nod  No I nod  In my head  Adversity  No stranger here  Just three months later  Breast cancer  An interim medication  For her depression  And now a visit  To her cancer doctor 
[01:30:00]  I hope I die  On the table  I seriously hope  That I die  On the table  And my sister  So I have to cry  Oh my god  But I just  Can't go on  When I get like that  I just  I can't  I mean  Breast cancer  Didn't faze me  Hello exactly  Because I was already  Down so low  That when someone  Told me I had  Breast cancer  There was no more  Steps to go down  After that battle  There was one more  Change to her medication  And then  Perhaps the greatest  Relief of all 
[01:30:30]  Normalcy  I feel completely fine  I sleep at night  I get up in the morning  And look forward to the day  I was listening  For a sound  She still teaches  Trying to undo  What her third grade  Teacher did to her  Humiliating her  In the classroom  So many years ago  Third grade  I thought it was wrong  Then and I think  It's wrong now  So I wanted to go  Public with it  So that people  Understand what  Depression is  She enjoys her  Husband's political  Career  Helping swear him  In last month  As acting governor  Replacing Jim McGreevey  Being rewarded  In her personal cause  When he was being  Sworn in 
[01:31:00]  She was running  Around like  Giuliani's kid  During his  During Andrew  Waving and dancing  Behind  Do you solemnly  Swear  Do you solemnly  Swear to keep  This bitch  Locked up in the  Basement  While you're doing  Important political  Things  Was that Farley  On SNL  That played him  In the goof  They did  That was the  Funniest  God damn bit  Farley playing  Giuliani's kid  At the inauguration  This is almost over  Personal cause  When on his first  Day as governor  He had breakfast  With the patients  At Greystone 
[01:31:30]  Psychiatric hospital  In Morris County  Feeling so much  More needs to be  Done  The poorest of the  Poor  Don't get the  Availability  Of the same kind  Of treatment  That my wife gets  And that's where  We really lack it  And still  She lives with this  Do you fear  That you will  Have another  Bout of depression  As you did  Two years ago  For example  I do  I fear it the  Same way  Same way I have  Breast cancer  I worry about  Cancer coming back  I worry about  The depression  Coming back 
[01:32:00]  Because I know  It's going to  Separate me  From my world  I live in fear  Of it  I'm afraid  With luck  Love  And continued  Good treatment  It has many  Years to go  But in sharing  Her story with us  She has written  A chapter that  Few get a chance  To tell  And if you want  More information  On depression  And other forms  Of mental illness  You can visit  Our website  Eatabullet.com  The National Institute  Of Mental Health  And the turnaround  That she describes  Is actually 
[01:32:30]  Relatively recently  All within about  The last year and a half  Brian Thompson  Thank you  Thanks Brian  Oh stop  I'm done  With these news people  Brian thank you  Very much  For bringing that  To our attention  Thank you  They don't care  They were like  Oh my god  Are you rolling  Tape on this  Whack job  Wow  They don't care  There's no sincerity  In the news  So what happens  Sincerity is the word  Of the show today  Right  There's false sincerity  Wow Brian  Brian thank you so much  So glad that we're  Now educated 
[01:33:00]  On depression  Wow okay  I'm so concerned  About this  Yeah  Anyway in sports  Anthony Greg  Did you read the rest  Of this  Yeah let's move on  So that's  Callous behavior  That's the audio  That we played a while ago  Ourselves there  So New Jersey  Governor Richard Cody  Yesterday came out  Swinging at a shock jock  Who suggested on the air  That the state's first lady  Was crazy because she once  Suffered from postpartum depression  Cody and Craig Carton  Co-hosts of the Jersey Guys 
[01:33:30]  Show on blah blah blah  First mix it up  Tuesday when they ran  Into each other  In a hallway  At the Trenton area station  Cody was there to do  His monthly call in show  A day earlier  Carton had mocked  Mary Jo Cody's depression  Which caused her  To have murderous thoughts  After the birth of her  First child  20 years ago  Her husband  Who became governor  When Jim McGreevey  Resigned last year  Has long been an advocate  For the mentally ill  And that's fine  You know that's fine  I feel bad for the guy  Obviously  They have to deal with that  What Governor Cody  Ought to do  Is approve the use  Of medical marijuana 
[01:34:00]  So women can have  A joint and relax  Instead of putting  Their babies in a  Microwave carton  Said according to  The Star Ledger  There's a great statement  Was he serious  You can't argue that  Just legalize pot  That's just a hack line  Relax bitch  Just a hack line  Women who claim  They suffer from this  Postpartum depression  Must be crazy in the  First place  Wow  You're real informed  Too buddy  The next day  Cody pounced on  Carton at the radio station  I wish I weren't  Governor  I'd take you out 
[01:34:30]  Cody said  According to the  Newspaper's account  Of the exchange  Yesterday Cody  Was still in a mood  To fight  Albeit in the  Safer setting  Of a news conference  I defend my wife  Like any man  Or husband would  Cody said  He also said  He told Carton  He would take him  Outside  Not out  On air  Carton demanded  His own apology  Relax Craig  Relax  Funny that's the  Same thing  McGreevey said to him  If I weren't  Governor  I'd take you out  Second  Line of the day 
[01:35:00]  Line of the day  Beat that  That's funny  And then he goes  If I don't get an  Apology from him  And he owes me one  He will wind up  The same way  McGreevey did  Out of office  Based on the power  Of this show  Carton said  He thinks he got  McGreevey out of office  Who knows  End up  Like McGreevey did  Out of office  Based on the power  Of this show  Here's an open  Apology  Now the radio guy  Is being a baby  I actually admire  This guy  Cody and his wife 
[01:35:30]  For saying this stuff  Of course  You gotta tease him  About it  Don't expect to  Not be teased  But I do admire  Them for being  Very honest like that  That's a nice thing  To see a politician  And his wife  Come out  And be like  Yeah we're not perfect  A little honesty  And then he's  Sticking with her  You know that's  Kind of a tough  Thing to go through  I'm sure  And some douchey  Radio guy  Says something  Which certainly  Could come from  This show  The governor's like  Hey shithead  I'll take you outside  Right  He's acting like  A human being  And a man  You can't demand  An apology  And then you go  On the air  And you're a pussy  Going I demand  An apology  Yeah why demand 
[01:36:00]  An apology  From a guy  Who's being a man  Yeah  The guy is just  Being a man  And you goof  On his wife  You goofed  And made fun  Of the guy  Then you gotta  Expect something  In return  Right  And then he can't  Turn around  And be a pussy  And go I demand  An apology  Or I'm gonna get him  Kicked out of office  That's a wimpy thing  To say  Could you imagine  Could you actually  For a second  Imagine this governor  Sitting down  And going  Oh I'd like to  Apologize to the radio guy  For goofing on my wife  And then me saying  That I would like to  Take him outside  It's not gonna happen  And there's no reason  It should  He's a hack 
[01:36:30]  And he's getting  Some exposure  On TV today  And he's all excited  So he's gonna  Make the best of it  The governor  I don't know  Anything about  Cody  The governor's a hack  Why are you  Call the governor a hack  The Jersey guys  Are hacks  And they're getting  Some coverage  So God bless them  And they're gonna  Take advantage of it  But to sit there  And go  I demand an apology  That's  You're a wimp  Yeah stop it  You're a wimp  You demand an apology  Why don't you get into  You should have got  Right into his face  When you had the chance  In the hallway  If you were so offended  By what he had to say to you  There were babies cooking

[01:41:00]  That's awful  Does the baby shut its eyes  Or are those blue things  Just staring at you through the water  Oh my god  He doesn't know the thoughts  Mom what are you doing  What are you doing  I'm too young to realize you're insane  Then he handed her a mental health book  Mama this for you  You know what  Too bad her mother didn't call her  And say that you need to replace it in your life  What you have to do is

[01:45:00]  XM202  You said I'd go away  I'm doing the best I ever did  I'm doing the best that I have  I'm doing the best I ever did  Now go away  I'm doing the best I ever did  I'm doing the best I ever did  Now go away  Weomp weomp weomp  All right. 
[01:45:30]  Any news on our Super Bowl trip?  Huh?  Do we want to give away?  No, of course not.  No, of course not.  Oh, no.  Is Ben around?  Does he have any info on that?  It's Ben.  Is he going to come flying in here?  No?  No info?  No info.  All right, well, there you go.  Thanks.  Thanks for the help.  Thanks for the info. 
[01:46:00]  I don't think we're going to get that off the ground, to tell you the truth.  I don't think we're going to get a lot of stuff off the ground, except for a lot of talk.  You know what?  We shouldn't get into it.  Let's not.  But just talk after talk after talk.  Let's not.  Talk after talk after talk.  They just keep talking and talking and talking and talking.  You can't let it go.  No, because it really is frustrating.  Because I know where we want to be with this radio show, but we're going to need some help.  We're going to need some help.  I know.  When I was bathing Elo, I just wanted to hold his head underwater. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  Yes, Jimmy?  I went to the doctor yesterday.  Stop it.  Yes.  Are you okay?  Yes, I'm fine.  Oh, good.  I just thought you might want to hear about my doctor.  What did you go for?  My nose.  Everyone's complaining in the air.  I get all these emails about stuff sniffling on the air.  It's because I have, you know, whatever.  So they gave me a...  I had to go to this specialist yesterday for my nose.  E.M.T.  Ear, nose, and throat.  Yeah.  I always thought it was ears, eyes, nose, and throat, but it's not.  No, your eyes aren't really hooked into that whole thing.  Well, they're in the area.  So I went, and it was a very expensive guy. 
[01:47:00]  It was like $350 for the visit, which made me want to throw up.  $350 is nothing.  It's a lot for a regular stop into a doctor.  No, it's not.  $350.  Me and Opie burn that a day.  We don't care about $350.  So I go in there.  I like my imaginary cigarettes for $350.  I get there, and this is not a fascinating story.  I just thought it was because I was shooting my new nose spray.  Yeah.  And I go...  New doctor-issued nose spray?  Steroids, yeah.  Oh, steroids.  You're on the roids now.  But it doesn't...  Yeah. 
[01:47:30]  I'm going to get roid rage in my nose.  Roid rage.  But it doesn't get absorbed into your body, he said.  Okay.  I thought you were going to have real muscular cheeks in a few weeks.  I shoot it into my chin.  His sinuses.  He could put a pee up his nose and shoot it 1,000 yards.  I could do coke while I'm still in someone's pocket.  Ben.  Tom Brady was doing coke out of Lord Miller's pocket.  I didn't get Bono there.  They tried to use my head to fix the coke whip. 
[01:48:00]  So the guy has me sitting there, and I'm sitting back with my head laid back in a chair,  and they have to do a sinus check.  So he takes these...  When you go to the dentist, they take a long stick with a little Q-tip on it,  and they numb your gums.  Yeah.  He had to numb the inside of my nose.  But it's like a long stick.  So my head's back, and then he just drops it in.  They don't jam it in, but you can feel it way in the back of your nose.  And it's like 10 minutes you've got to sit there.  Wow.  10 minutes with this thing up your nose?  Your head back, one in each nostril.  And the guy comes back with this little alien probe. 
[01:48:30]  It looks like a long metal shoelace.  Aye, and then you pull some big round probe up your nose.  Aye, wrap your head in a towel, or they will catch you.  Howdy, Quaid.  Welcome to the party, Richter.  Oh, that is exactly what it feels like.  The big thing?  No, it's just like a little probe.  A little teeny thing.  But that...  You feel it.  Snaking up your sinuses? 
[01:49:00]  You feel it, even when you're numb.  All of a sudden, it tickled something in the back, and my eyes just teared.  I look like Bob Kelly at a midget convention.  Oh, it was horrendous.  That is bad.  Yeah, so I've got to go for probably surgery.  And what does that do?  Like, what probe thing?  Oh, they look inside your nose to see if you actually have blockage.  I have a deviated septum, and I'm really embarrassed to admit this, but I have fat turbinates.  Those are the...  I thought they were looking a little chubby lately. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, big turbinates, big, thick, masculine turbinates.  When you breathe, air in, it goes through these little, I guess, bone areas in your face,  and those are your turbinates.  But mine are too thick, so that's why less air can get through.  Do you have to carve that out, you think?  That's why we used to try this steroid spray, because if it's all tissue...  It's not a tumor.  Sometimes the steroids will shrink the tissue, and you're fine, but I think I'm going to  have to go through surgery.  I kind of want to go through surgery.  Now we're having fun.  And it will be on a commission for a few days.  Stop whining. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, I really am belly aching.  Stop it!  And I wanted to put my turbinates in the microwave.  Turbinates?  And they've got to pack you with...  After they cut, they've got to go in there and cut, and like...  They're doing all kinds of things in there.  They've got to go in there and kind of open the whole thing up.  Oh my gosh.  Are you kidding me?  And then pack it with stuff.  It's like having a nose job, right?  It's exactly like that, yeah.  Exactly like that, except I don't have fake tits and I'm not Jewish.  That is frightening. 
[01:50:30]  Dude, I'm so claustrophobic like that.  Like the idea of having my nose packed with material...  Right.  ...and only being able to breathe through my mouth is horrible.  So he said maybe we can put a tube in so you can breathe through your nose.  Maybe we can pin Jimmy down and hold his mouth shut for a few seconds and watch him panic  and then let him breathe and hold it down.  Or maybe you could get a dominatrix to do it with her ass cheeks before the operation.  That I wouldn't mind, actually.  That's a fine kind of suffocation.  Bathe him and hold his mouth underwater.  Anthony, this just in.  Yes.  The booger from Anthony's couch, on instant feedback, so fired, the tsunami song has just gone international. 
[01:51:00]  Really?  Yeah, I guess the BBC is now reporting on the tsunami song.  The BBC.  Wow.  Yes.  We are obsessed with the tsunami song.  Once again, American shock jocks in trouble, don't you know?  Meh.  Meh.  We don't do those kind of things here.  Meh.  Meh.  They're so prim and proper over there.  Do they even have English shock jocks?  Oh, look, I'm having tea with no sugar in it. 
[01:51:30]  I'm a barbarian.  Are there English shock jocks?  I've never been over there.  They're probably shocked at the way Americans overreact.  Really?  Probably.  Look what Harry did and he apologized and it was done.  You say you're sorry.  Look, it was awful what we did, but no, not in America.  They moved on.  They moved on.  That's probably what they're shocked at, what babies we are.  Yeah, shouldn't Harry lose his job?  What's his job?  His job of being second in line to Prince Charles, who's next in line for the throne? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah, rather.  Hey, uh...  Just a little swastika problem.  Nothing to really worry about.  Who came up with this Noah admitted homosexual thing?  He's not an admitted homosexual.  He's not.  No one's even implied that he was gay.  We just were looking and noticing that he does have some feminine qualities.  Yes.  And he dresses like a gay man might dress, but his sexuality is a mystery to us. 
[01:52:30]  He says he's had girlfriends and had sex with girls, so there's nothing really there.  Like today, he's dressed like Pacino in Cruising.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  We were trying to figure it out.  I couldn't figure it out.  Hey, you and your yellow bandana.  You want to stop in?  No, I just like watching.  Then don't wear that.  Ben was laughing at Noah pretty good this morning in the office because of what?  The Gucci sunglasses?  Yeah, the Gucci.  I mean, those have got to be expensive.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  Talk into the mic.  Yeah, Mike.  There you go.  No, his mic wasn't on.  That was the first thing Ben asked me when I walked in this morning.  What kind of glasses am I wearing?  Well, I mean, aren't you concerned about losing them?  Gucci?  How much do a pair of Gucci sunglasses cost?  About $210.  $210.  And they're not, you know, they're yellow.  I mean, are you wearing those for driving or why do you wear the yellow?  No, I just wear it for...  He's just trying to look like a rock star.  It doesn't work, though.  Today, you're just trying to look like a rock star.  Everybody calls it the Bono look, but I don't know.  Yeah, but Bono wears purple ones.  Well, like a member of Shanon Hall. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, Paul, Paul.  Bono without all the talent.  Yeah, and the wife.  And that awful feminine thing walking with him.  I like this kid, though.  At least he cares about the way he looks.  I like the look.  I mean, the jacket is fine and the glasses are fine.  Thank you.  The hat...  Now, did you try to dress tougher today because of all the abuse you're getting on the radio show?  No, I wasn't going for tougher look at all.  You got the leather jacket, like the biker jacket on, right?  What does your t-shirt say?  It doesn't say anything except on the back. 
[01:54:00]  No, there's a...  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  He takes the jacket off, the leather jacket.  It's hung on one arm.  He spins around and shows his back to us.  Like a model.  No, what is the t-shirt underneath the shirt?  Oh, it's a shirt.  Oh, I saw C-O-C.  It's a shirt of guy in the city.  It's in Russian.  I have no idea what it says.  You might want to find out.  What's it say on the back?  I saw it say something about Negroes here and an arrow pointing down.  Oh, my God. 
[01:54:30]  Armani Exchange.  The way you push the back out when you turn, he actually turns and kind of pushes...  I know.  He pushes his ass out.  Let's just be reflexes.  Let me ask you.  Seriously, was Leonardo DiCaprio...  Were you really that mad at him in this boy's life when he said that you played for the  pink team?  I mean, did that really upset you?  I don't know what you're talking about.  That's what he reminds me of.  All right.  Now, who came up with the no-admitted homosexual thing?  You?  No.  Danny, who came up with this?  Steve?  I have no idea.  Someone sent it in also, by the way, since we're on the gay songs, there's a very funny 
[01:55:00]  Steve the Bear song that came in.  Yeah, we should get that.  We should get Steve in here as well.  But someone put this together, and it's not accurate.  Here, you've got to put some headphones on there.  Put some headphones on, sweetie.  There you go, so you can hear that.  Help him!  I guess one of our listeners sent this in.  C-Rock, isn't it?  C-Rock.  C-Rock?  Oh, by C-Rock.  C-Rock.  All right.  Maybe we should have those headphones plugged in, you know?  That would be smart. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, why wasn't that?  Yeah, I want this kid to have headphones.  There you are, angel.  There it is.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Get that chair out of your way.  Yeah.  Make him comfortable.  Sit right next to you.  Get in there.  Martini Steve.  Yeah.  Wow, why do you...  All right, hold on a minute.  Martini Steve.  Who sent this in, the admitted homosexual thing?  Admitted homosexual was a kid named C-Rock, I think.  Who is he?  Some kid.  He said it to Ben, I think, first.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Just a listener.  Yeah, just a listener.  All right, it's a cool-sounding thing, but it's inaccurate. 
[01:56:00]  So I'm going to defend Noah today.  Yeah, you're not an admitted homosexual.  Wait for a change.  Thank you.  Well, listen to all the inaccuracies here, okay?  Okay, I'll listen.  Noah.  Admitted homosexual.  It's a bit on the feminine side.  There's a lot of tell-tale signs questionable about my sexuality.  Right, right.  I have to be honest, I woke up late.  I didn't take time to pick out my outfits.  So I went to a psychiatrist who told me that I was a woman.  Tracks and a man.  Do you shave your chest?  Yes, I do. 
[01:56:30]  Do you shave your butt crack, too, so nobody gets chafed?  Yes, I do.  I got a question for Noah.  Hey.  Ricky Martin fan?  Yes.  Admitted homosexual.  What celebrity would you have sex with?  God, that's a hard one.  I don't know.  I'd say Jude Law is a good-looking guy.  Jude Law?  Admitted homosexual.  What is it that made you pick him?  He's decent-looking?  I don't see anything wrong with that answer.  Admitted homosexual.  So you'd have sex with Jude Law?  Yes.  Jude Law.  So Jude Law, you had to pick a second choice.  But there had to be kissing involved.  I guess.  All right, I guess I would go with Matt Damon, I would say.  Matt Damon.  Brr. 
[01:57:00]  Admitted homosexual.  Admitted homosexual.  That's pretty cool sounding.  That was great.  I'd have to say, that's kind of out of context.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I'm going to defend here.  That's the way it works, dude.  I appreciate it.  That's something they don't teach you in broadcasting school is how much you'll be taken out of context.  Well, let's see.  Let's go through it.  It's true you would have sex with Jude Law, and it's true you would kiss Matt Damon and have sex with him.  Right.  You did say that.  So other than that.  I didn't say I would.  I said if I had those choices.  Those are my only choices.  Right.  Which means you would. 
[01:57:30]  We didn't say there was no girls involved.  We said, you know.  Yeah, but Jim here said.  Oh, I guess we did say if you were gay.  Had to.  Who would you have sex with?  And you said, well, Jude Law is cute, and you would also kiss and have sex with Matt Damon.  I mean, Jim here said Ozzy Osbourne, so I mean, you know, we were given options.  Right.  That was called Psych 101.  We believe that.  When I was in the doctor's office, I'm looking for people yesterday, and I thought of you because it showed, like, the older issues of people.  And at one point, Jude Law was voted sexiest man alive.  Well, how about that?  That's a fine choice.  You have a good taste. 
[01:58:00]  That's a fine choice.  There you go.  But what's not true about this promo, you don't shave your ass crack, right?  No, I do not.  But you do shave your chest.  That's true.  And you shave your junk.  No.  You didn't say that?  I never said that.  All right.  No, we didn't ask that question.  Nope.  And you're not a Ricky Martin fan?  I am not a Ricky Martin fan.  Oh.  But all the other things are true, right?  You like Cher?  I do not like Cher.  Honestly, I don't.  Barber Streisand?  My dad likes Barber Streisand.  I don't.  Interesting.  Yes. 
[01:58:30]  He's actually a big fan, which kind of scares me, but...  Yeah, well.  Interesting.  This is a really good puzzle that we're trying to figure out.  I know.  Because just when you expect him to say, yes, I'm a Cher fan, he goes, no, I'm a Zeppelin  fan.  Yeah.  This is very confusing.  He likes Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones.  I grew up on classic rock.  Since I was six, that was my first album with Led Zeppelin box set, so...  Liza Minnelli?  No.  Led Zeppelin.  Let's see.  Zeppelin.  Anyone else from the classic rock genre?  The Who?  Anyone else? 
[01:59:00]  Like The Who?  I just saw The Who in a concert about a year ago.  You did?  Yep.  They're pretty good.  I'm Mike.  Who was with you?  I'm Mike.  You're going to talk on Mike.  Who was with you?  Who went to The Who Show with you?  I went with my brother and his friends.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Just curious.  That's all.  Yeah, people can be curious, right?  Be curious.  Apparently.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with exploring a little bit of curiosity that happens.  You get curious, you just, you know.  Explore.  Ask.  All right.  Watch.  Taste. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  Say bye and get out of here.  All right.  Good talking to you.  But not B-Y-E.  All right.  That's what I said.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye?  Bye.  Okay.  That's what I thought.  Curious.  All right.  Sorry.  I went way over the top of that.  The dope I am.  Thanks for ruining it.  I really am an idiot.  There he goes.  You say something subtle and I can just spell it out.  Folks.  What he meant was.  What a dope.  That was the only thing I was going to come up with today and you stepped on it.  Thank you. 
[02:00:00]  No, but I thought that I caught it like, oh, I got a good one.  B-Y-E.  Yeah.  I know.  Stupid.  Bye.  Yeah.  That's what he meant.  He wanted him to say bye.  All right.  Well, now I got to hear the promo again.  Mm-hmm.  As we go to break.  A quick break here.  Noah.  Admitted homosexual.  It's a bit on the feminine side.  A lot of telltale signs.  A question of all about my sexuality.  I have to be honest, I woke up late.  I didn't take time to pick out my outfit.  So I went to a psychiatrist who told me that I was a woman trapped in a man's body.  Do you shave your chest? 
[02:00:30]  Yes, I do.  Do you shave your butt crack too so nobody gets chafed?  Yes, I do.  I got a question for Noah.  Ricky Martin fan?  Yes.  Admitted homosexual.  What celebrity would you have sex with?  God, that's a hard one.  I don't know.  I'd say Jude Law is a good looking guy.  Jude Law?  Admitted homosexual.  What is it that made you pick him?  He's decent looking.  I don't see anything wrong with that answer.  Admitted homosexual.  So you'd have sex with Jude Law.  Jude Law.  So Jude Law, you had to pick a second choice.  But there had to be kissing involved.  I guess.  All right, I guess I would go with Matt Damon and I would say it would be.  Matt Damon. 
[02:01:00]  Admitted homosexual.  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today?  Cancel all avoidments.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I mean, I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath.  And begin.  Fix it, fix it. 
[02:01:30]  Guess who's back?  I'm overhitting them.  Back looking.  Nice head, dick.  Bag.  Bag it.  Guess who's back?  Oh, man.  Back looking.  I don't believe it.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Back looking.  Guess who's back?  Too afraid.  Turn it off.  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess who's back?  Turn it off. 
[02:02:00]  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Shit.  Oh, yeah.  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now.  What are y'all doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  This looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me, because we need a little way.  Because it feels so empty without me.  I said, this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me, because we need a little way.  Because it feels so empty without me.

[02:04:30]  To prepare for more.  So be it.  Settle the score.  Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore.  Come to the bay.  In the news today, Texas executes killer who cited Metallica lyrics.  Really?  What was that about?  His final words were lyrics to a Metallica song? 
[02:05:00]  We're back with the O&A program.  How cool is that?  This could be the coolest guy ever.  What was his name?  Kunkel?  Troy Kunkel.  Yeah.  Spent more than half his life on death row.  38 years old.  For shooting a man and robbing him of 13 bucks in Corpus Christi.  How about that?  1984 shooting gained notoriety with disclosures that Kunkel from San Antonio and then 18 quoted 
[02:05:30]  lyrics of a song by the heavy metal rock group Metallica after 31-year-old Stephen Horton  was gunned down.  So he said the Metallica stuff after he shot the guy, shot the guy, and then quotes Metallica.  Did he do it, though, as he was being executed?  No.  Oh, that would be cool.  Oh, okay.  Just shooting a guy and then quoting Metallica isn't as cool as, like, them strapping you  in.  Do you have any last words?  And, you know, yeah, yeah! 
[02:06:00]  And just go off on a Metallica tune.  And what's the lyrics about, just before you die, look up at the...  Oh, help me out.  Uh, uh, for whom the bell tolls, help me out.  Someone on this feedback about looking up in the sky for the last time.  Danny?  No?  Oh, I thought you had it.  All right.  Stevie, you awake?  You're always wearing a Metallica bandana.  After shooting Horton in the head, Kunkel chanted, another day, another death, another  sorrow, another breath.  They say that Horton didn't know what happened when he was shot, and he thought he was hearing 
[02:06:30]  a who.  Uh, Kunkel's, uh, last words before he was put to death, though, uh... 
[02:07:00]  Your mom's box?  Actually, yeah.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Of course not.  Should be the final words.  Your mom's box.  It was, um...  Screaming chinks.  So people were outraged.  Uh, all right, uh, Martini Steve has been here, Anthony, since, uh, 2.30 in the morning.  It's Martini Steve. 
[02:07:30]  Martini Steve.  It's Martini Steve.  Sure is.  And, and you look like you're gonna pass out.  I am exhausted.  I am cranked on, on ephedrine and caffeine like you would not believe.  Just trying to stay awake.  Oh, yeah, it's fun.  Pits are real sweaty.  He came in to get all the audio together for today's program, Anthony.  Yeah.  All the audio that we haven't got to yet.  He's good like that.  Because we're too busy just kind of goofing around today.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm so glad I came in too early.  But, uh, we do have a Martini Steve song. 
[02:08:00]  Well, it's not actually a Martini Steve song.  I know, but that's your name.  Oh, okay.  This one's called Steve the Bear.  Steve the Bear.  By Chemistry.  Chemistry did this one, too, huh?  Yeah, he did a really good...  Chemistry with a K.  And then, uh, I don't know, man.  Wack Bag, you know, you guys gotta calm down.  We're giving chemistry credit for these songs that he's, uh, sending in.  And they're like, oh, that's BS, man.  They're not saying that chemistry is part of WackBag.com.  Oh, relax, you idiots.  Everyone calm the F down. 
[02:08:30]  You know what I noticed, though, to their credit?  It's such a small percentage of people that are complete douchebags on that site.  Very small.  For the most part, everyone's pretty cool.  But there's this small little minority that just point out the dopiest little things.  You want to reach in somehow and choke them and drown them in the bathtub.  Look, you know, the Opie and Anthony message boards are a lot of fun to read.  They really are.  There's gonna be lulls in the program, and there's gonna be lulls in the discussions that you could have. 
[02:09:00]  So at that point, don't start stretching and trying to come up with some kind of new thread.  There you go.  Where you get overly picky and stupid.  Just let the board sit for a day or two.  Don't worry.  Something will happen on the show, and then you'll be able to discuss and discuss and discuss.  But that's where those message boards get into trouble.  When they start speculating all kinds of things.  Or just reaching for the stupidest thing, because there's nothing else to talk about at that given moment.  Did you see the Tim Sabian one?  Yeah.  Where they talk about Tim Sabian, and some jerk-off just chimes in and goes, 
[02:09:30]  Well, they had a falling out.  And I remember Opie and Anthony were really pissed at Tim Sabian.  We've never had a falling out with Tim Sabian, the program director of WYSP, who has been promoted.  And he's like a program director for, I don't know, most of the rock channels or something for Infinity Broadcasting now.  Not only a huge fan of our show.  Dude, I talked to Tim Sabian at least twice a week still to this day.  To this day. 
[02:10:00]  He's one of those guys that became a friend besides working together.  These know-it-alls that confuse people with other people.  That's how rumors get started.  And Tim Sabian really, really wants us back in Infinity Broadcasting.  Yeah.  He wants us on some of the channels.  Of course he does.  Some of the radio stations.  That is a fact.  Mm-hmm.  And there's also other people that want us on in Philly as well.  So there's a big, huge thing going on right now.  There you go.  Things.  No speculation.  That's what's happening.  There you go.  Speculate.  We love Tim. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  That great body of his, packing of those slacks.  Those slacks he wears.  Yeah, showing it off.  Slacks.  All right.  This guy has the Metallica lyrics that I was trying to remember.  Stupid, but before we move on.  Whoa, Pat from Buffalo.  Go ahead.  Hey, the line you were looking for is, take a look to the sky just before you die.  It's the last time you will.  Thank you.  Thanks.  I love that lyric.  You're welcome.  Punch it out.  All right.  It's very simple.  He's got to land that jet.  All right.  Didn't he sound like the opening to the original Superman series? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, that awful wind.  Okay.  Yeah, with that wind sound.  Well, chemistry from whackbag.com.  Is everyone happy now?  What's whackbag?  And now there'll be a thread.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  They made good.  Shut up.  We plug that site a lot considering the fact no one plugs a website more than this show does,  especially one that's not controlled by this show.  We don't control the content of that show.  We always plug it.  And then you plug whackbag.com because a member sends in a song, and then the gang 
[02:11:30]  from opanthony.net gets pissed off.  It's no satisfying people.  I guess everyone's fans of the radio show, but then there's sex.  There's the whackbag contingency, and then there's opanthony.net contingency, and they  don't get along with each other.  East coast, west coast.  It's insane.  If you're a member of whackbag, they don't want you posted on the other one and vice versa.  That's what hip-hop's all about.  Cringehumor.net, there's a problem with them, with whackbag and cringe humor. 
[02:12:00]  There's some kind of a weird thing going on.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  You want to go to war?  Patrick has his fat face buried in some coke on a desk, but it's not coke.  It's just sausage.  I'm snorting it.  And then there's that awful site, wowfans.com.  Oh, does Paul feel my...  I love Paul, though, man.  Paul's hilarious.  Paul just...  We told the story at the sushi restaurant where he's talking about black people, and we're 
[02:12:30]  like, dude, what are you doing?  Oh, all loud?  Real loud.  I'm going to blurt out racist remarks.  Keep him low.  He has no decibel control at all.  My brother, who's pretty insane as well, he was even really...  Remember how pissed he was getting that bad?  Like, will you shut the F up?  It was really funny.  And Paul is just having fun and talking, but he's one of those really loud, and he's a  British guy, and he has that accent, and he's just a psychopath, and his face is kind  of crunched in.  It's not stretched out like a normal face.  It looks like he had a normal length face, and someone went, come here, and crunched it 
[02:13:00]  down.  And he's like a Sharpay, just saying awful loud things.  And my brother was like, he was getting really mad.  The same brother that punched the guy on the train on the way home one day, because the  guy was speaking really loud on the cell phone.  Hell, he should.  And was saying the N-word over and over again, and my brother's like, listen, first of all,  you're talking way too loud, and I don't like that word at all.  And the guy could care less and kept talking and talking, so my brother just sized him up  and waited for his stop, and just clocked him as hard as he's punched anyone in his 
[02:13:30]  life, and just stepped off the train and left.  Is that why he was standing outside Hot 97 this week, waiting for them to walk out?  Sorry, I was reading.  Nope.  Don't worry.  I was reading.  Where's the button?  I didn't...  No, don't worry.  It was a reference to him not liking the racist remarks, so he was going to beat people  up at 97.  You know, when I get home, I'm going to listen to the replay, I'm going to put up my sound  board at home, and hit the crash during that part.  I was actually... 
[02:14:00]  That was where Ope should have hit crickets, though, because regardless of the reason,  there was dead silence after that, and some crickets should have been played.  Jack from Atlanta.  Oh, I was reading.  That was awful.  Jack.  Morning, fellas.  What's up, Jack?  How come the show's kind of changing?  What do you mean?  Ever since y'all started being broadcast on terrestrial radio...  We're not on terrestrial.  You're not on in Rochester anymore?  No, we were only on in Syracuse for two weeks, man.  That ended before the new year, and we kind of figured it was going to for contractual 
[02:14:30]  reasons, to be very honest with you.  What happened to the sexy state and that kind of stuff?  The edge is just kind of off.  Chick's got a call up, and...  Oh, my God, guy.  We went through this yesterday.  The show is still very edgy.  It goes in stages.  Right now, we're not getting a lot of sex stuff on the show, but that'll come back.  The only testing y'all ever do is in the promos when it's just commercials.  And, dude, you don't understand that, first of all, we have not been getting a whole lot  of calls for sexy estate, and then if you do that, like, twice in a week or every two  weeks, you get the opposite end of the spectrum calls. 
[02:15:00]  People are like, dude, with too much sexy estate, it's like there's no middle ground  that makes people happy.  No.  We know what you're saying, dude, but really, people get really weird.  And if you're obsessed with cursing, then, you know, maybe the show's not for you.  I mean, there's enough cursing going on.  We were just joking about babies being drowned in bathtubs.  The show, trust me, is still very edgy.  You know how many curses?  Also, yesterday was a very curse-filled show, I noticed.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks.  It's a certain amount of self-policing, too, and it's just because we want to, dude. 
[02:15:30]  I do it on stage.  You've got to do it sometimes when you're a performer of some sort.  Just the way you work.  And we're consciously trying to be clever and funny, because, you know, Anthony and I have  done a lot of interviews, and they ask about the show.  We've been doing it for 10 years.  We've been very successful.  And I've said so many times in interviews, you know, we get frustrated that all they focus  on is the shock jock angle.  Shock jock.  And the reality is, the reality is, the show works because we make you guys laugh every  day.  And we want to just focus on that as much as possible. 
[02:16:00]  And then we'll throw some shocking stuff at you.  Sure.  We'll throw some girls at you.  No problem.  No problem.  But in the end, we want to be known as a funny, clever, edgy show that just makes you laugh.  That's it.  Relax.  Relax.  It's really, really simple.  There's not enough sex.  I get more anti-sex emails than pro-sex.  Once in a while, somebody just wants sex a lot.  But I get more of them that goes, dude, enough with the chicks.  It's like, you can't make people happy.  Oh, and believe me, you know how many emails we read after we get chicks in here going,  oh, yeah, girls doing things on the radio. 
[02:16:30]  Wow, that makes great radio.  You know, we've got to come in here on a daily basis and do the show that we enjoy doing.  That's it.  You listen to it, you enjoy it, fine.  You don't, sorry.  Go elsewhere.  There's a couple of changes that we are trying to do with this show, and they're very, very simple.  We want to play a lot more audio on the program because we think there's a lot of opportunities  to just goof on people just saying stupid things on TV shows and on the news. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, I like that.  And we have a nice little feel for that stuff because, you know, we can see right through the BS.  It's almost a mystery science theater thing.  Yeah, in a way.  Where you play it and, I don't care, step on the lines.  It's hysterical.  Yeah, it's an element, I think, that's going to be really, really good for the new show.  You know, and we're always...  Keep Steve busy.  We don't want to do the same old thing either.  You know, we want to continue growing and coming up with new things, and that's one way we want to go.  A lot of audio and just goofing on the audio. 
[02:17:30]  And also more current events.  Yeah.  More current events because we're now a morning show, and we get to open the papers up and be the first people to kind of comment on all the crap that's going on in the world.  So those are two changes that we're definitely trying to make.  Everything else, we understand what got us here, so we're keeping all the other elements.  That's what we're doing.  Instead of sitting here waiting for girls to come in so we can, you know, shove bats in them.  You know, what would that guy have us do? 
[02:18:00]  Oh, do sexy estate.  Okay, so let's just sit here and wait for the phone to ring so a chick and a guy can call up and have sex on the phone.  There's always going to be that minute percentage of every audience of every medium that you will never please.  And if you do listen to the show every day, we haven't gone out of our way to say,  Stop calling if you want to be sexy estate.  We haven't said anything.  If it happens, it happens.  We're still playing the promo from time to time, right?  Yeah.  And this guy thought we were on terrestrial radio.  Dude, no.  Uh-uh. 
[02:18:30]  No.  Well, he was just a jackass all around, wasn't he?  Yeah, I don't know.  He's just concerned.  He doesn't want to see the show get all cutesy'd up.  But again, like Ope said, we're talking about throwing a baby into a microwave and drowning it and making fun of that.  That's what edgy is.  It's not a chick with her tits hanging.  That's not what edgy is.  Right.  Or us saying fuck over and over again.  Language, young man.  This is still my home.  You know what we've been talking about?  No more cursing.  Yeah.  How is terrestrial radio going to accept us if we curse?  Come on.  Remember, soften.  Soften.  Soften everything, everybody. 
[02:19:00]  Let's say hi to Pat in Buffalo.  Same guy?  Hey, what's going on today, guy?  Are you?  Are you?  All right.  What's up, Pat?  Hi.  I moved to Buffalo.  Hi, Apple Tits.  How are you?  Shuffled off to Buffalo.  Hi.  It's cold.  Hey, I think those guys at Wackbag, I mean, it's a great website, and it's an awesome message  for those guys take it so fucking seriously.  Like, you cannot breathe a bad word about anything.  If you, there was somebody the other day that wanted to declare war on the Jim Rome fans 
[02:19:30]  because Jim Rome apparently said something about the ONA fans.  So they're ready to declare war, and then there's 19 posts on this guy.  The boys have not officially declared war yet, so it's not time to go to war.  I just need to tell these Wackbag people, they need to light me up because it's a radio  show.  We do love Wackbag, man.  They are psychopaths.  Yeah, but that is kind of fun, though.  They wait for us to declare war, and then all hell breaks loose.  That is fun.  I like them.  There's fun elements to these message boards, trust me.  I like them.  And what they're trying to do is they're trying to keep, because message boards always have 
[02:20:00]  a tendency to self-destruct, no matter what show it's from, but they start like piranhas  starting fighting each other.  It just gets ugly.  So Wackbag tries to keep that under control.  They have to rule with an iron fist sometimes, and they do a good job of it.  They keep their people in line.  It would be complete anarchy if they didn't, and those are the message boards that explode  and self-destruct.  They've done a good job of policing themselves.  There are certain rules in place that the owner of the board has put there, and he sticks  to those rules, and that's it. 
[02:20:30]  And people bitch about him, complain, do it all you want, but that board's still around.  And it's one of the boards that I go to.  I post on it every so often because it's funny.  You know, there's some posts that are really funny.  I like getting involved in the Photoshop aspect of the board, too.  I jump in there, make a few Photoshops, throw them on the board.  It's funny.  I'm just trying to figure out which guy you are on there.  Who, me?  I'm thinking you might be Wiffle Ball Bat Lube.  But I'm not really sure yet.  Wiffle Bat Lube.  Wiffle Bat Lube.  Right.  They know who I am.  Wiffle Ball Bat Lube. 
[02:21:00]  Wiffle Bat Lube.  Just Wiffle Bat Lube.  Is that you?  Yeah.  I never read a post by it.  I just said it's called me.  That's me.  Wiffle Bat Lube.  Cigar and Scott's called in the other day.  He's actually funny.  Yeah.  There are some really funny guys on there.  Absolutely.  There are guys that either through Photoshop or just throwing lines out there that are really  funny.  There are funny guys on opianthony.net too.  And don't forget Cringe Humor.  I've had quite a few laughs there.  Don't diss any of them.  You ever read Jim Norton on Whackbag?  The guy who posts under Jim Norton?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:21:30]  It's not you, right?  Yes.  It is you?  Because you can't tell.  There are some guys that are named Jim Norton and it's not Jim Norton.  I know.  I'll actually only post under my real name.  But you know how funny it is to go to sign up for a weird site somewhere and use Jim Norton  and they go, that name's already taken?  Already taken, yeah.  I want to bite somebody.  And then I'm kind of like, wow, that's really cool.  That's cool.  Guys, using my name.  Yeah, it's cool.  It's just funny.  I get email from some of these guys every once in a while.  They're like, you know, we notice you haven't been promoting our message board lately.  Is there a problem that we could work out here? 
[02:22:00]  Like, problem?  I don't even notice.  Maybe, you know?  Yeah.  I know his Whackbag is just more aggressive and more, you know, I don't know, productive.  Not productive, but they're out there.  Like I said, they know how to run.  So maybe whackbag.com comes up a lot more, but I don't know.  We're not purposely trying to slight anyone.  I think we crashed Whackbag.  Oh, really?  Trying to get on.  It's just not going.  It must be getting slammed now.  Actually, I know the show's starting to grow again because it's getting, you know, harder 
[02:22:30]  and harder to get on some of these websites that crash in.  There's a lot more members, a lot more posts.  So it's kind of exciting to see the show slowly but surely growing.  Yeah, you mentioned a website and it just gets pounded.  The first month here, that didn't happen.  So go to eatabullet.com right now.  You don't want to go there and order the CD or the DVD?  Oh, it's Bob.  Why did he bring in this animal with him?  I was like, yeah, but he's our friend.  He's a bodyguard.  Holy ass.  Bob Kelly needs a bodyguard?  No, no, no.  He's not for what?  Exactly.  Gavin stands at the buffet and keeps Bob away from him. 
[02:23:00]  He has no idea what we said yet until the delay kicks in.  Watch.  He'll jump up in a second.  Johnny from Virginia.  Go ahead.  What's up, Owen?  Hey, morning, Valley Boy.  Hi, Angel.  Hey, Johnny.  Hey, Jones, I got to complain a little bit about the Carson thing.  About the what?  The Carson thing.  You guys hold back a little bit.  A bunch of guys sitting around bullshitting.  And I noticed you check the clip a lot. 
[02:23:30]  Like, Ope, he'll say, holy ass.  Dude, I swear to God, there are times Ope does that in real life.  Oh, yeah.  We do self-police on purpose.  But Ope will actually do that.  It's a force of habit at times.  Yeah, because we did terrestrial radio for so long that we started saying,  F this, F that, holy ass.  So it's just part of how I talk in real life.  And this is an extension of real life in a way.  And, you know, if you want me to try to force myself to curse, fine, whatever.  But I'm not purposely going, oh, wait, I don't want to say the curse here. 
[02:24:00]  So I'll say, holy ass.  It's just that's how I talk in real life.  The beautiful thing about Satellite, I'm not trying to cut you off, dude.  I'm sorry.  But it's like, and I understand people have concerns.  But the thing about Satellite is when the best joke is profanity and that's the line, you're able to do it.  But there have been times even since we've been on XM where I've done stuff where I've been cursing.  And I'm like, that was just not the funniest way to go.  And it's like, I did it because I could.  And that's what gets annoying as a performer.  And that's what we try to avoid.  So it's not like, oh, don't curse.  Like, God, don't.  It's just if it comes out, fine.  If it's the best joke, fine.  But you don't make it happen just to make it happen. 
[02:24:30]  And on this show, I think it distracts from what you're trying to say sometimes.  Yes.  Sometimes it fits in perfect and we've blurred them out.  But sometimes it just distracts from what you're trying to say and the point you're trying to make.  If it comes out, it comes out is what it comes down to, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Seamus in New York.  Seamus, what's up?  How are you guys doing?  Good, Seamus.  Hi.  Morning, sugar nut.  Hi, Seamus.  Seamus.  Have I heard that name before?  What movie?  Seamus.  Seamus.  I think the movie name was Seamus, wasn't it? 
[02:25:00]  Was it?  Okay.  I don't know.  Seamus.  Seamus.  That was good.  I was with a girl one time and she put her finger in my Seamus.  I don't know.  Tee hee hee.  I called Seamus.  So Martini Steve's here and we got Chemistry's song.  Yes.  That's how this got started, I guess.  I'm sorry that we went off on a stupid tangent.  Went off on the message board thing.  We'll start doing radio again.  Yeah.  And the song's called Steve the Bear.  Yeah.  It's actually a bear.  I want to hate Chemistry's guts for this song, but it's really good. 
[02:25:30]  The kid's getting much, much better at putting these things together.  I got to hand it to him.  He's done some good ones.  He's going to get accolades now.  Chemistry from where?  I don't know.  I think he's from some website.  Oh, Chemistry from CringeHumor.net.  No, that's right.  Wait, no.  I thought he was from EatABullet.com.  Or WowFans.com.  Yeah, I'm not sure anymore.  I don't remember.  I have a short-term memory problem here.  Here's the song, Steve the Bear.  Steve, Steve the Bear. 
[02:26:00]  Steve, Steve the Bear.  Sweet Steve the Bear.  Sweet face, so cozy.  We go back to his place and in his cave, he shows me his flame hat.  I wonder how he can wear that.  Wonder how many cubs got caught in his bear trap.  His flaming clothes are exotic, homoerotic, and light, Steve.  It should have never came out the closet. 
[02:26:30]  But if you wear it, the cybern's got to be in good shape.  Can't be a cozy bear if your hair don't look great, Steve.  Steve, Steve the Bear.  Sweet.  Steve.  Sweet.  Steve the Bear.  Sweet.  Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Sweet.  Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Sweet. 
[02:27:00]  Hey, that's not bad.  A cute little ditty.  Let's put that in heavy rotation.  I want to hear that once an hour when we go to break.  It's kind of creepy.  It really is.  There's something really creepy about it.  It's kind of catchy, though.  It really is.  He's an awful human being for making it, but god damn, is it catchy.  That's funny.  Just the fact that everybody knows that you're sweet and cozy.  That's what he knows now, sweet and cozy.  Sweet, cozy.  Wonderful, thank you.  Big bear.  All tattooed up, but you're cozy.  Not for that one friggin' guy.  Dude, that made the whole AVN walk around all day worth it. 
[02:27:30]  The fact that that gay guy called him a sweet-faced, cozy bear.  That made the whole day worth it.  That's the fact they got to see his body.  You like that song?  Yeah.  Steve the Bear.  It's a good one.  It takes away from, now I don't have to hear my awful song.  It's Ben.  I love that one.  Yeah, we like the...  No, that one, I like it.  Yeah.  Hurricane Ben.  Hurricane Ben.  It's Ben Ben.  It's Ben Ben.  I'm Brady.  Ben has a website dedicated to him. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  That was made a long time ago.  Well, what's it called?  I have no idea.  What's it?  Get Sparked or something?  Yeah, it was some guy, when I was at Sirius, made it.  Some gay guy made it.  A gay guy?  A gay guy dedicated a website to you?  Yeah, he made a Ben Sparks fan site.  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  I guess he could look at that hog one day, and he had to get online and do something about it.  Speaking of which, by the way, Bob has the coolest hat ever.  You know how Earl has the black-on-black Yankees hat?  He has the black-on-black Patriots old logo hat.  Bad ass.  Once again, New England ripping off something that originated here. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  I'm surprised New England has anything that's all black, and they're allowed to sell as rotten  racists in Boston.  Unless it's standing up on a block with an auctioneer banging a gavel next to it.  All right, Ron on Long Island.  What's up, Ron?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Don't listen to these assholes.  Your show is perfect.  Language!  Don't change a thing.  But yesterday, we've got to get smarter about the assaults on the media.  I screwed up yesterday. 
[02:29:00]  I was driving through Smithtown.  I'm a heating contractor.  I'm driving down to my van.  I saw an Eyewitness News van on a side street.  It was about quarter to 12.  I figured I'd get ready to do a live feed on the 12 o'clock news.  So I turn around, and it's going through my mind.  I'm going to call my wife.  I'm going to have her tape it, because it's after the 12, so I'm just sitting there listening  to the replay.  I pull over diagonally so I can see him in the mirror, and I pull a piece of cardboard  out of the back of the van, and I start making a sign.  I'm writing Opie and Anthony. 
[02:29:30]  I'm about to write, wow.  I'm not looking in the mirror.  All of a sudden, a knock on the window.  I'm like, scared the shit out of the language again.  I was kidding, dude.  And it was the guy from the van, I guess the cameraman or something.  What are you doing?  So I just panicked, jammed it in gear, and took off.  I almost ran over his foot.  He nailed you, dude.  Oh, God, he nailed me so good.  We've got to get smart, man.  Do you happen to have a WOW sticker on that vehicle? 
[02:30:00]  Actually, yes, I do.  That's exactly what tipped him off, my friend.  Do you understand in the New York area that they're on to us?  You've got to be very, very covert.  I've got to get some duct tape and put it over there.  By the way, we haven't had an assault on the media in a while.  No.  That's what I was thinking.  Everything's going through my mind.  I've got to get this.  Wow, this guy had the perfect setup, and they were on to him because of the WOW sticker.  Yep.  Oh, well.  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  I'm fine.  Thanks for asking.  How are you?  Ugh.  He got me.  He did get you, right?  Yes, I'm yammering on my stupid, friendly answer. 
[02:30:30]  I'm such a sweet-faced boy.  It's Dallas in Colorado.  It's a girl.  We've got a girl on the phone.  Dallas.  Hello?  Hey, what's up, Dallas?  Hey, well, I can barely hear you, for one.  Well, you know, maybe roll up the windows.  No.  I know it's warm in Colorado.  Is it warm in Colorado this time?  Some parts.  Some parts?  Yeah.  I don't know.  What's that?  Nothing.  Get out of the mountains.  Hey, well, I can barely hear you, but anyway, I have a suggestion. 
[02:31:00]  First of all, I think you guys' show is great.  I think it's funny.  I bought this show for my husband, and I end up listening to it.  Thank you.  And second, you know, when you always bring on, like, male comedians and things like that?  Uh-oh.  Why don't you guys invite, like, a female, like, Felicia Michaels or somebody?  Oh.  You know, she'd make Jimmy Norton.  Girl comics.  She'd make Jimmy Norton, I think, blush.  But I don't know.  Dude, I don't.  I'm all for female comics.  Judy Gold, I think, would be a very funny guest to get on.  Judy's funny.  If a comic's good, they'll be invited on. 
[02:31:30]  Who's this Felicia girl?  Who's that?  What's that?  Felicia Michaels.  She's a stand-up.  I know.  I haven't seen her in a long, long time.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry, guys.  You can barely hear me.  Yeah, we gotta move on.  Stay there.  All right, we gotta move on.  Her phone just stinks there, so.  Oh, I love that.  When they do those HBO specials where it's only girl comics.  Oh, I could just watch that for hours.  Ladies' night out?  Ladies' night out.  You know you're just gonna have a fun-filled night of just female comics?  Oh, I'm there for the whole show.  You know what HBO special I love with the funny women? 
[02:32:00]  Where they're walking around, and they get into a car, and they lean their head over,  and they go, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then they hand their money to a pimp,  and he punches them in the face.  What was that funny HBO female comedy special?  Ugh.  Nothing but period jokes and jokes about ex-boyfriends.  Can't wait.  Oh, well, my mother's wondering when I'm getting married.  Shut up.  And I told her when I write a good joke, so she goes, oh, never.  You know, I wanted to drown my baby in the tub the other day, or cook him in the microwave. 
[02:32:30]  I couldn't decide, so I just went for shock therapy.  Oh, how crazy.  Oh, I see.  Brett from Virginia.  Yes, the queens of comedy.  Yeah, Brett.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Let's go, Brett.  Hey, man.  I'm right here with the rest of the guys in Virginia, man.  I subscribed to y'all whenever y'all had the freebie, but things have changed.  Yeah.  All right.  So?  I mean, there's no... 
[02:33:00]  Where's...  What's in your pants?  Where's Childo?  You know, where's the girl coming in and having sex on the show?  I mean, that's the way y'all put it out on the air.  Well, some of that will come back, but here's the decision you make.  If you don't like the direction of the show, then cancel.  I don't care.  It's two bucks a month, dude.  Yeah.  And when I say I don't care, I really don't care.  There's enough people that are listening, and...  When you say you don't care, you really don't care.  No, but I really don't care.  I don't care.  Dude, we're a comedy show.  There's times where sex is integrated into it. 
[02:33:30]  But again, what you're saying is, like, how come the Childo doesn't get played?  We got complaint emails.  Dude, we heard that enough times.  It's like you just cannot win.  Like, I understand what you're saying.  You like the sex stuff, but Playboy has great sex stuff.  Flip over that if you want to have, like, really hardcore sex.  Well, damn, Jimmy.  If I want to listen to Sam Too Broad, you know, talking about gay, lesbian, sex, then, yeah.  I mean, that's what I'd listen to.  Well, Brett, it's two lousy dollars.  If you're not getting two dollars of entertainment from this show, then cancel.  Yeah.  Because we're not going to sit here and kiss your ass. 
[02:34:00]  You either like it or you don't.  That's the choice you get to make.  Do you get seven cents worth of laughs out of this show a day?  Out of you, Jimmy?  No.  No, out of the show, not me.  Oh, boy.  Another Jimmy thing.  I mean, out of Opie and Anthony and some of the stuff that they come up with, the genius that's doing the remixes, yeah.  Okay, so you don't get any laughs out of me, but you do get some out of the show.  So at least you're getting your seven cents worth, correct?  Yeah, I mean, yeah, pretty much, yeah.  Okay, well, then you answer my question.  But I'm just saying that the format of the show has changed. 
[02:34:30]  I know what you're saying.  And I'm saying, do you get your seven cents worth?  And you're saying from the show in general, you do.  Right, but I'm just saying...  We heard you.  We heard you and we addressed it.  You get your seven cents worth and that's all you need to know.  What's the problem?  The problem is I'm just saying that the show in general has changed.  Okay, all right, you know something?  I will even buy that.  I'll say the show has changed.  You know something?  When we first came on the air here at XM, I think we were really...  Because we had nothing else to base it on.  Right.  So we were going on what we used to do in the afternoon at NEW. 
[02:35:00]  And it was very hard to do that in the morning here on XM.  So it kind of seemed a little forced and it was rough.  And we had a hard time the first couple of weeks we were on the air.  I think now we're falling into more of a rhythm of what this show is about.  I think just the time we're on affects what content we have on this show.  It's the type...  You're kind of almost a different person in the morning than you are in the afternoon.  And I think if we were doing afternoons, you'd get a show that was similar to our older show 
[02:35:30]  than you do now that we're in mornings.  Now that...  You know, there's a lot more topical stuff to talk about because the news hits fresh in the morning.  We do that.  We like doing a lot with the sound because that's fresh and new in the morning.  So yeah, has the show changed?  Yeah.  Okay, I'll give you that.  Is it a bad thing?  I don't think so.  No, I think it's a really fun show to listen to.  And this show will always be changing.  And as it changes, we'll lose listeners and we'll gain new ones.  That's what radio is all about. 
[02:36:00]  So you might cancel because you don't like the direction of the show.  But you know what?  We may pick up a bunch of new people because, whoa, I like the new direction of the O&A show.  Do we make a conscious effort to take off Sexy Estate or Guess What's in My Pants?  No!  Call up!  We'll play!  Jesus Christ!  I'm a concerned listener.  You know, I don't want to cancel y'all.  I'm just a concerned listener.  Dude, we don't care if you do cancel.  Stop repeating yourself.  I wanted to go after him.  But who cares?  You don't need to go look.  I'm not going to cancel. 
[02:36:30]  So what?  Bye!  I'm going to make the point again.  This show will always change constantly.  And as it changes, we will lose listeners.  It's the nature of doing radio.  And you will gain brand new listeners that go, hey, whoa, I like when they talk about the news.  Yeah, exactly.  So we can't worry about it.  Enough of the defending the show portion of the show.  Yeah, enough.  Dope from Virginia.  Two bucks an hour.  I mean, two bucks a month.  Two bucks an hour?  Jesus, now it's expensive.  I'm saying two bucks a month. 
[02:37:00]  Let's calm down now, Jimmy.  That show's worth two dollars an hour.  Let's give Seamus another try.  Seamus?  Seamus.  How are you guys doing?  You hereby now?  Hey, we can hear you, Seamus.  My phone cracked out earlier.  How are you doing, Sugar Nut?  I'm better now.  Thanks, Seamus.  That's good.  Don't worry about these fuckers.  I'm not.  Dude, it's no concern.  They can't stop their wives when they get home if they need to.  What's that?  Did you not see American Idol last night?  Well, yes, I did.  That's why we took your phone call.  It's called the radio segue, everybody.  What?  At the very end, when he does his douchey secret out, and he was supposed to have fireworks 
[02:37:30]  behind him when they did it, and it didn't go off right away.  Did you see his face?  Yeah, he said, where are the fireworks?  And then they started going, it was kind of funny.  It was almost like a little outtake moment.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  He's such a dick bag.  Who's that?  Ryan Seacrest.  It's just like, eh.  He's just about done.  Anyway, I'm starting to fade out of American Idol. 
[02:38:00]  Already?  Just like I told you I would, yeah.  Well, you'll probably get back into it when they start having the competition, right?  We got to play.  No, I will not.  No, no, no, no.  It's fun because, you know, it's all the bad singers, and you get the real personalities,  you know, on the earlier shows.  And then it's going to get down to people that are almost good at singing, competing against  each other.  And at that point, it's like, who cares?  For me.  I kind of like it.  No, I know you like it.  I can't be bothered.  I mean, this guy Leroy Wells from the other night, he was unbelievable.  We should play his audio.  Want to start with that? 
[02:38:30]  Leroy?  Yeah.  I loved Leroy.  Leroy, by the way, is the next William Hung.  You think?  Everyone is competing to be the next William Hung.  I think they found it with this guy Leroy Wells.  You watch.  I don't think there will be another William Hung.  Because when he was on, I mean, he was all over the place, like right after he was on,  because he was just so goofy.  That whole look that he had, his bad singing and dancing, not at all.  This guy's just a lunatic.  His innocence.  Yeah, but this Leroy Wells, man.  That tree right through his head. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, it all just added up to a star.  This guy Leroy Wells, though, man.  He came walking in there just stomping and singing.  Couldn't understand a word he was saying.  Couldn't understand him.  They had to have subtitles when he was talking.  They put subtitles on him, and he was speaking what he thought was English.  It was hilarious.  I really enjoyed this kid.  Yeah, that was hilarious.  Well, here we go.  Here's Leroy Wells from Two Nights Ago on American Idol.  Listen to this guy.  Hey, Leroy, what's up?  Can you do? 
[02:39:30]  It's this one right here, baby.  Yeah, come on up.  Where you going, dog?  I don't know.  I'm telling you, hey.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh-oh.  Oh, there's Michael James.  I'm talking about.  Hey, hey, hey.  Baby, I got you money.  Don't you worry.  Hey, hey.  Can you do?  Wait, wait.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Slow down.  That is great.  Dude, that's.  Stomping and clapping and singing.  If we play that ten times this morning, it would be stuck in your head, and it just is 
[02:40:00]  very catchy, no?  It kind of is.  Hey, hey.  I'll give him that, but he looked like a lunatic crackhead on stage.  Yeah, he definitely had a little crack look to him.  I think your stupid Gene had to open his mouth and spoil it, douchebag.  Gene, the worst celebrity judge they've ever had.  Of course he is.  Yeah.  I went back way too far.  Sorry.  Wow.  Hey, Leroy, what's up?  To the beginning.  I don't know.  Sorry.  It's this one right here, baby.  Yeah, come on up.  Where you going, dog?  Why not just play Ecstasy of Gold? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  All right, all right.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, baby, I got you mine and don't you worry, hey, can you do it?  Wait, wait, slow down, slow down, slow down.  Why don't you introduce us?  What's your name?  Okay, my name is Leroy Wells, and I sand blaze and paint for a living to chill, yo, with my  dead.  What?  Wait, Leroy, you got to start again.  Yeah.  I sand blaze and paint.  Sand blaster paint.  Yes, sir. 
[02:41:00]  Sand blaster paint what?  Sand blaster paint.  Sand blaster paint, you know, we're about to betrick.  And, uh, it's a shrimp, but it's real slow-like.  It's country.  And we, we ain't making no money, so y'all need to put me on TV.  Can you dig it?  We can make it.  But wait a minute, dog.  Dog.  Wait, come back.  Dog, dog.  So, I'm going to run it off.  I play the drums, the keyboard, anything.  I'm a musician, you feel me?  But see, I got the tech, get y'all crunked so y'all can feel me. 
[02:41:30]  Yo, man, we need to get crunked like this.  Right there.  Look, look, see.  White teeth.  White teeth.  You got your crunk.  Put your crunk here.  Look at your crunk.  Man, you're going to hear that crunk.  Oh, those aren't your teeth.  Sounds like County Lockup.  What the hell was he yapping about?  Sounds like that scene from Airplane, that old movie.  I speak jive.  Unbelievable.  That guy was off.  And Randy's saying dog.  He has the hip factor of Noah.  That's just awful.  There's nothing tough about you, stupid.  Dog.  Yeah, let's not forget.  He was the stand-in bass player in Journey. 
[02:42:00]  Who was?  Years ago.  What's his name?  Randy?  Randy Jackson.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Randy Jackson was the replacement bass player in Journey when they booted out their original  bass player.  And his name was?  Ross Valerie, I think it was.  Oh, you know the name.  Damn it.  I was going to challenge you there.  My brother in the Journey cover band.  I know all about Journey.  More than I'd ever want to know.  All right.  Now, here's more of Leroy Wells.  Singing some James Brown here, eventually. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, he got his crunk down.  One, two, three, four.  Hey, baby, I got your money.  Don't you worry.  Hey, baby, I got your money.  Don't you worry.  Hey, baby, I got your money.  Don't you worry.  Hey, baby, I got your money.  Okay, I can't take it anymore.  Yeah, exactly.  I think it's catchy as hell.  Catchy.  Get him off.  It's catchy.  The guy wouldn't shut up. 
[02:43:00]  No one could understand what the hell he was saying.  And they entertained him much too long.  Wasn't it, baby, I got your money?  That's what you want to hear from a black guy.  Oh, this is the real one?  Oh, I like Leroy's version better.  This song stinks.  He makes it cool.  Good pickup, though, Derek.  Very good.  Who did that originally?  Is it really a Michael Jackson song?  No.  What is it?  Old dirty bastard.  Okay.  No, but doesn't Leroy say I'm going to do some Michael Jackson for you? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, but what the hell is he saying?  Back to the audience.  I can't.  You dig it.  You know what I'm saying?  Thank you, Jesus.  Because you got to put Jesus first.  If you don't, you ain't going to do nothing.  Tell Simon Kyle he's going to put Jesus first.  Simon, you don't put Jesus first.  No, Simon's over here.  Wait.  He's right there.  You don't put Jesus first.  Something wrong with you.  Now, can you dig it?  In America, do you have a button that puts subtitles on? 
[02:44:00]  Can you spin the cut?  See y'all ain't listening.  This guy needs a subtitle.  Yo, Dalvin, can you sing?  I can sing.  It's crock.  It's just going to be crock.  You just going to do that?  But sing something there.  This is a singing competition, honey.  I told you what I was singing.  Hey, hey.  Yeah, but a different song.  It's the same thing.  James Brown, anything.  I feel good.  I knew that I would. 
[02:44:30]  So good.  So good.  And I got you.  Stomping and clapping.  I got it.  So good.  So good.  I got it.  You're a stepper, man.  You're a stepper.  You're a stomper.  No Negro spoken here.  I thought I heard Negro.  He's a musical fellow.  Yeah.  He knows how to keep a rhythm.  Yeah.  Give him a spackle bucket and some drumsticks and he'll make a fortune out on the streets. 
[02:45:00]  But he's not American Idol material.  I just love this guy, though, man.  Something about him.  Yeah, but I'm trying to make you feel what I'm talking about.  I feel you, man.  We feel you, though.  Can you dig it?  Yes.  Where's your digger, baby?  Look at Simon.  He's right here with you.  Simon, you need to get caught.  You need to cut everything.  Chop and get caught your body here and do that.  Yeah.  Can you imagine a Simon had the crunk teeth like that?  The Simon was crunk.  Hey, this is for the TV and this is for your mommy and daddy. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, baby.  I got mine in the gallon, though.  Yeah.  Dog, you ain't right for this, man.  But listen, we love you, man.  The energy.  He's the hype man.  I mean, you the ultimate hype man.  You are so entertaining and energetic and fun.  But you know this isn't the right competition.  But see, that's why I'm on TV right now.  So y'all gonna put me on.  Can I tell you something?  You are definitely gonna be on TV.  You're definitely gonna be on TV, man.  I don't care.  That's the thing.  I want to be on Hollywood. 
[02:46:00]  I go to Hollywood.  I should not be outside.  You see, y'all don't want me to go to Hollywood.  Because I know I'm gonna take off.  Yeah, you're gonna take off.  I'm gonna take off.  And you know that.  So do what you do.  Leroy.  It's all good.  Planet Earth calling Leroy.  Leroy.  I see a taser in his future.  You really can't get a good assessment of what you do until you listen to Simon.  What?  The winner of the show gets to go on the Jay Leno show the following day.  I'd love to be in their office planning that interview.  It's just ridiculous.  I mean, I did not understand a word you said. 
[02:46:30]  It's all good.  Let me know what to do.  Am I here?  Am I not?  So I can go back home and go to work before my dad?  No.  Okay, baby.  No, man.  Appreciate you, dog.  Y'all got to say it for me.  Can you dig?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we can dig it, baby.  Keep it crunk, baby.  Keep crunking your life.  Keep it crunking, boy.  I'm here.  And there he goes.  I think he should have been shot. 
[02:47:00]  Gene Simmons, the worst celebrity judge ever.  Guy was on.  People are coming up.  They were, like, they give him a little, I don't know, a little extra sympathy to judges,  usually, and let them go through to the next level if they're good enough.  Yeah.  You know, you don't have to be the best ever to get through the first level, because they  understand you're nervous, you don't have music backing you and stuff, and they need  people that are going to be booted out for the second level anyway. 
[02:47:30]  And Gene Simmons is just taking everybody and, no, you're not good enough.  No, I say no.  And people that normally would have gotten through, that would be what pissed me off.  Right.  If I went up there and knew that if Gene Simmons wasn't sitting there, I would have gone through  to the next level, and because Gene is like, he was ragging one guy, because he didn't  look like he should be singing boy band songs.  He goes, you're getting a little too old for that genre of music. 
[02:48:00]  Me?  Yeah.  How about you, you fossil?  He's 60, wearing boots and makeup.  He's like one of the Andrew sisters.  But he's telling this guy, you know, and then, no, no, I don't think so.  Is it this clip?  Oh, wait, it might be long, though.  Randy.  You guys can both sing, man.  It's just funny that you sing boys to men songs.  Yeah, there it is.  You guys can definitely both sing.  Definitely.  Yep.  Yeah.  Gene?  You know, the oozy, oozy kind of whiteboard thing really helps when you're a teenager, 
[02:48:30]  because everybody, the girls, swoon and stuff, you're getting to that age where it's becoming,  in my opinion, too old to sing this kind of material.  Hey, hello.  That's the biggest problem for me.  Paula?  For me.  Oh, God, I just hate him.  No, I won't take a picture with you.  He was your hero.  He was, but he's just such a douche, you can't like him.  I'm going to kick you down the stairs and then hug you and hold you.  I wanted that guy to hug me and love me and make me feel better with his god of thunder  boots.  Anthony, this just in. 
[02:49:00]  Yes.  This just in.  Breaking news.  You nailed it with Leroy Wells.  American Idol hopeful Leroy Wells watches his performance from the lockup.  Oh, no.  Are you kidding?  You nailed it, dude.  Are you kidding?  You nailed it.  An American Idol hopeful gaining notoriety, but not just for his shot at stardom.  TV viewers found Grand Bay's Leroy Wells on national TV Tuesday night.  However, on Wednesday, the would-be Idol could be found in jail, Anthony.  While millions of American Idol fans kept it locked into Leroy, Leroy was locked up behind 
[02:49:30]  bars for failing to appear in court.  The 22-year-old Alabama native wowed fans with his rendition of Got Your Money by ODB.  Even though he wasn't able to watch his performance from home, sheriff deputies tell NBC15 they  did allow Leroy and other inmates to watch American Idol from jail.  Mobile police spokesman Marcus Young says Leroy Wells was arrested earlier this month for reportedly  shooting a handgun into an occupied vehicle.  Nice.  There you go.  Didn't you just know this guy was a criminal? 
[02:50:00]  I don't know.  I'm watching the show going, this guy's got to have something bad in his past.  He's saying, hey, hey, you got my money, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, because you know  what it is?  He was too crazy not to be a criminal.  The guy, you could just picture him on the streets, like going crazy.  Apparently, they were arguing over how the cars were in the roadway, at which time Mr.  Wells allegedly shot the victim in his hip. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, my God.  How the cars were in the roadway, family members say, because Leroy is a pretty boy, he gets  picked on a lot, which explains why he may have been carrying a pistol to protect himself.  Wow.  I guess a lot of people picks on him, and he's had that problem since he's been a kid.  As he got older, he just got tired of it, and so he took measures into his own hands.  Oh, they quoted.  I thought that was a typo. 
[02:51:00]  They quoted his family saying, a lot of people picks on him.  That's what I mean.  A lot of people picks on him.  Alabama.  His brother says, despite those incidents, Leroy is destined for stardom and would not  go as far as shooting another human being.  I'm saying he didn't do it.  It's all hearsay, from what I know.  Hearsay.  Yeah.  He shot a gun.  A guy has a bullet in his hip.  And, oh, my God.  Wednesday, Leroy's family had trouble coming up with the bond money, some $11,000. 
[02:51:30]  Who doesn't have 11 grand?  To get your kid out of the...  Opie, what's $11,000?  That's nothing.  It's a mere bag of shells.  Really?  I mean, I spent that on dinner last night.  Who doesn't have 11 grand?  But then later they came up with the money.  So there you go.  And you nailed that one.  Wow.  Hey, hey.  I was making a joke.  And another idol thing that I noticed, Paula Abdul is either drunk or on drugs during this 
[02:52:00]  whole thing.  I don't know what's going on with her.  She's slurring every word that comes out of her mouth.  She's all belligerent and getting angry.  Not even like in a fun way.  She's really getting pissed off and yelling.  Her eyes are at half-mast and kind of crazy all the time.  And she can't speak.  She's like, I think you're wonderful.  Like she's drinking booze in that cup in front of her. 
[02:52:30]  I never saw it like this on the other seasons.  Carl Roberts?  Yeah.  This is one of the fights, you think?  I didn't watch.  Let me see.  Did it say fight?  Yeah.  Fight, fight.  Yeah, they were having fights.  What track is that?  Six.  She's a very kinky girl.  The kind you won't take home to mother.  Tempers began to fray.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:53:00]  You know what I'm saying?  No, no.  I disagree.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  I disagree.  I really do.  No, you don't.  I do.  Well, then I know more than you.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  With great respect, please.  Yeah, that was a little tiff.  With what respect?  What'd Randy say?  I don't know.  Who cares?  I don't know.  But I like Randy, man.  He really brings it.  He's the only.  He's, I don't know.  I was going to say he's the only real one on the.  They're all douches.  Yeah, they all kind of, whatever.  Simon kind of just sits there and tells him. 
[02:53:30]  He is so sick of some of these performers by now that they come in and if they suck,  he just doesn't even look at them, turns his head and just tells them, you know,  no, why would you, why'd you even come here?  And then when they're good, he goes, you know something?  You're fantastic.  You're one of the best we've seen.  That's why it's so fake because.  I don't think so.  I think it's blatantly honest.  The producers, yeah, but the producers are, have a whole bunch of people in the hallway  and they're like, all right, guys, this is the, we're going to bring in a bunch of  people that just stink.  Here they come. 
[02:54:00]  Here they come.  They already know.  They already know going into it.  Yeah, but you don't know to what degree they suck.  I think people can really be bad, but they're just not that good singers.  And then there's other people that are just, why the hell did you show up?  They honestly think they're good.  There was a woman that showed up last night.  She was singing.  Every single note she sang was off key, completely off key.  Was it on there?  I don't, I don't think so.  No.  Maybe, who knows.  But it was so bad that she could not possibly know, not know she, that she sucked. 
[02:54:30]  And those are the people you just got to blatantly say, look, you're awful.  You are terrible.  I think the disingenuous part is that there's so many singers that are never making it to  that level.  They're purposely, like you said, pushing people through just so Simon can be wacky and say  mean things as opposed to having 40 people come in that are actually all fairly good and  then just going, eh, you're not quite, you know what I mean?  They want him to be able to do that.  But they know America wants to see some of these people singing really bad.  So I get that part of it. 
[02:55:00]  I'm not saying it's wrong, but that's why they do it.  The first couple of seasons, Simon was more with the wacky, goofy insults than he even  is now.  He doesn't really go for those, you know, trying to come up with something witty and clever.  Now he just says, no, you're awful.  You have no business being here.  But it used to be, like the first couple of seasons, he would try to come up with some  witty way to tell them they stunk.  He really doesn't do that anymore.  That's why I think he's the most honest guy on the stupid panel.  All right.  Here's another fight from last night.  I'm so excited.  I just can't hide it. 
[02:55:30]  I'm about to lose control and I just can't hide it.  Can I talk?  Yes, of course.  But listen.  Let me talk without you rudely interrupting me, Randy, for once.  Oh, God.  You hear her?  She's really genuinely angered and she slurs and just sounds like drunk girl at the bar  that's getting into an argument.  On the first day of January, 1892. 
[02:56:00]  Okay.  Simon, what do you think?  Oh, wonderful.  I bet you he can do Kermit the Frog very well because you have that kind of like nasal  tone.  So, Randall, I don't want to be rude, but did you turn up at this audition today to be told  by Paul or Abdul you can do Kermit the Frog?  Shut up.  I'm just reinforcing your point.  Shut up.  I'm just reinforcing the point.  And she's just, her eyes are half closed and she's going, shut up. 
[02:56:30]  I think she's on the dope.  I think she's on something.  Yeah.  Maybe a few pills.  Take a look at her during these episodes.  Well, how would you feel if your biggest contribution to the entertainment industry was a video with  a fake wolf?  That's the last time anybody looked at her was doing that stupid song.  With the cartoon.  Oh, there it is.  Eric's good, man.  Crank it up.  She was hot for five minutes.  Did the awful girl sing Whitney Houston? 
[02:57:00]  Don't remember.  Don't remember, huh?  I kind of went to sleep right after this.  So, I was a little, I may have been a little woozy during the broadcast.  All right, let's just see if this is it.  I don't think it is, though.  Come on, come on, come on.  Can't run from myself.  There's nowhere to hide.  Don't make me close one more door.  What business?  I don't want to hurt anymore.  Okay, thank you.  I don't want to hurt anymore, so I'm going to say no, no, no, no, please. 
[02:57:30]  How do you think you did?  Terrible.  It was terrible.  Stay off the microphone.  Nice to meet you.  Thank you, man.  They show up really thinking, and you could see in their face when they tell them to stop  singing, and they stand there kind of at ease, and they look at the judges like, all right,  what did you think?  And you're just looking like, they honestly think they had a shot.  I'm Sarah Jane Woodall from Vegas.  Okay.  I'm going to represent my city by singing Viva Las Vegas. 
[02:58:00]  Cool.  Well, you've said it all, haven't you?  Right.  I got it all down, man.  Okay, off you go.  Bright light city, gonna set my soul, gonna set my soul on fire.  I got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn.  She was in a little cowboy suit.  Yuck.  I think it was the psychic.  There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there.  They're all living, the devil may care.  The psychic?  Is there a psychic on there?  That's all out of key?  Viva Las Vegas.  Oh, okay.  Viva.  Viva.  She's out of breath.  Viva. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  That's like Elvis grunting on the bowl that last time.  This might be it.  I told you don't be nervous.  I'm not.  I know what I mean.  I'm going to bring that yellow ticket home.  I hope so.  I predict that I will be able to make it in the top ten, and I will be able to be picked  today.  Mama, mama, mama.  It's her warming up outside, talking to her mother.  Na, na, na, na, na.  Na, na, na, na, na.  Her voice warmed up.  The psychic moves to meet her fate. 
[02:59:00]  Hello.  Hello.  How are you?  Hi.  How are you?  Welcome.  Welcome.  Hi.  There's not one note on key here.  What's your name?  Bobby May.  How old are you, Bobby?  22.  She looks like 40.  Yes.  And you work as a psychic?  Yes, I am a psychic.  Are you through or not?  I'm through.  I'm going to go to Hollywood.  Okay.  All the way to Hollywood.  All the way to Hollywood.  All right.  I'm going.  So what are you going to sing, Bobby?  I'm going to sing Elvis Presley, Can't Help Fall In Love With You. 
[02:59:30]  Lovely.  Wise men say, only fools rushing.  That's hilarious.  But I can't help falling in love with you.  Not in one note.  Shall I stay?  Would it be a sin?  For I can't help falling in love with you. 
[03:00:00]  Darling, so we go gently to the sea.  Take my hand.  This is another song from Hot 97.  I'd rather hear the Tsunami song in there.  For I can't help falling in love with you. 
[03:00:30]  I love the depth in the voice.  Oh, yeah.  I love the naked sidekick.  And she's standing there wondering.  I said that I'll make it in the top ten.  She sounded like a bad cassette tape.  Oh, that was the top ten scene.  You can't really watch you.  In front of the TV at home.  The player eats it.  I'm here to sing.  Well, you did.  And you didn't do it very well.  Oh, why is that?  You didn't sing a note in tune.  Bobby, I think you've ended two careers at once.  This is the first time I've seen that.  Who's that? 
[03:01:00]  She was number ten in her seat.  So she said ten.  She saw ten.  So ten was her seat.  That's all it was.  Trying to justify her psychic abilities.  Because she said she'd be in the top ten.  Oh, oh, oh.  And she was in the number ten seat.  And that's what she saw.  So that's what.  Without her mother?  Yeah.  If your child sings like that, you should let her be bathed by Governor Cody's wife.  No talent whore.  Give the little toddler to the first lady of Jersey there.  You know, a Pop-Tart in a microwave. 
[03:01:30]  If you're that old.  If you're that old.  Meany, meany.  We've got to rewind the show just a second.  You know, Gene Simmons is talking about.  Gene Simmons.  You know, that a lot of these people just don't have talent.  And he's very rude and stuff.  And he thinks that some of these kids that are still in their very early 20s are getting  too old to sing boy band type songs.  Which was kind of a stretch.  Because like Jimmy said, what?  He's pushing 60 now and doing his thing still.  Putting on his face makeup and spitting blood. 
[03:02:00]  Uh-oh.  Demon coming.  Uh-oh.  Well, we've got a nice example of Gene Simmons sounding young and hip, Anthony.  All right.  Let's go to the tape now.  I'm a fire starter.  Twisted fire starter.  Oh.  Ugh.  You're the fire starter.  Twisted fire starter.  Yeah, there you go.  I'm a fire starter.  Twisted fire starter. 
[03:02:30]  Gene, maybe you shouldn't be singing those songs.  Yeah, I think you're a little too old to try to cross over, stupid.  Yes, uh, Eric.  You should see the music video.  He's dressed like a pimp in a big fur coat, dancing around in a mall.  Yeah.  Because he's a fire starter.  Yes, he is.  Ooh.  He spits the fire.  Starts the fire.  What an ass.  That guy's hip.  Oh, are we taping this guy on the Today Show?  Oh, they just had an Asian guy on there.  Maybe he was talking about the Tsunami song. 
[03:03:00]  According to Steve, yeah?  Yeah, Steve running in.  All right.  One more bad example of singing.  And this guy's doing Neil Diamond real bad.  On the boats and on the planes.  They're coming to America.  Haitians?  Never looking back again.  They're coming to America.  Home.  Don't it seem so far away.  Oh, we're traveling light today.  Yeah.  In the eye of the storm. 
[03:03:30]  Right, thank you.  Are you aware that when you sing, you do a stabbing motion?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  All right, enough of that.  Tsunami.  Da, da, da.  Watch that tree go through her head.  We're drowning in Indonesia.  Little chinks are floating by.  Drowning in Indonesia. 
[03:04:00]  Little babies washing up on the rocks.  Ain't no big surprise.  They're all drowning with their slanty eyes.  The wave hits so hard, you're knocked right out of your blue jeans.  That's horrible.  I wish I knew more of his stupid songs.  Yeah.  Very cute. 
[03:04:30]  What's the other one of the songs, Eric?  Yeah.  Which one?  Cracklin' Rosie.  Cracklin' Rosie, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Uh-oh, hope there's not a big protest outside.  Oh, look out.  Out the window, watch it.  500 people being angry and you can't tell by their expressions.  All right, all right.  He sounds angry, I don't know.  Let them be angry if they want to be angry.  I know.  What the hell?  All right, what haven't we played in a while?  We should play something a little longer so we can take a break here.  Something with sex in it.  Yeah.  Something with a lot of cursing and sex. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Hey, dude, the show's changing.  I mean, there's not enough chicks.  Yeah.  Fuck yourself.  God almighty, am I tired of these douchebags?  How about this?  If you don't like the show, just cancel it.  All right, I got it.  There you go.  Scumbag.  Easy enough.  In honor of Leroy Wells, we'll play our old tape of Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail.  Oh, that's some segue there.  I know.  I'm trying.  I like to be known as the segmeister on the program.  Ooh.  This is Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail.  That went horribly wrong. 
[03:05:30]  Ah.  As we go to break, we'll have to bring Bob Kelly in next, I guess, because he is here.  Yes, he is.  Looking good.  And should we do the midget audio maybe next?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Because Bob Kelly's here?  We'll talk about the midget show and play some of the audio.  All right, good.  All right.  Hello, Mark.  Yo.  Are you ready to play Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail?  Sure.  All right.  Now, what are you going to tell your mom when she gets on the phone?  I don't know.  I'm going to tell her I was with a couple of prostitutes.  Wow.  That could be pretty good.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  I haven't been to jail in like about eight years, so. 
[03:06:00]  So she thinks you've cleaned up your act, huh?  Yeah, and I'm happily married, you know?  Uh-oh.  Oh, and you're married and you got caught with the prostitutes?  Yeah.  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Okay, cool.  Make this good.  Here we go.  Yeah?  Ma.  What?  Listen, it's Mark.  Yeah?  Listen, I'm in jail.  What?  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  I got caught with a couple of prostitutes.  Who's this? 
[03:06:30]  Mark.  It's your son, Mark.  Where are you?  I'm in jail, downtown.  Don't tell Gina.  I need you to come bail me out.  Who?  You.  With what?  Oh, get away.  I don't know.  You can't.  Don't call me.  Don't call my house.  This call's being monitored, ma'am.  Okay.  The police department.  I didn't know if you were joking with me or if you were serious or what.  No.  Mom, serious.  We've set.  Oh, jeez.  We've set the bail at $5,000, ma'am.  That will be cash.  $5,000? 
[03:07:00]  Yes.  What did he do?  It was found with a couple of prostitutes, one of which was a transvestite.  And it's a serious charge, ma'am.  Will someone be coming to pick him up?  Ma, what?  Can you come?  We've got to clear this up before it makes the paper tomorrow morning.  Who am I speaking to?  This is Officer Jenkins.  Officer Jenkins.  I'll have to call his brother.  I'll call his brother and see if I can get the money.  We know also the prostitute has tested positive for the AIDS virus, which is another problem 
[03:07:30]  he's going to have to deal with.  Hello, ma'am.  Yes, I'm here.  Oh.  Where's Sonny Boy?  Are you speaking up to your mother?  Yeah, ma'am.  What?  Well, I don't know how to tell you how this happened.  I was with the brain.  You know the brain?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I picked him up with a couple of them.  It's not a laughing matter, son.  I know.  I know.  Mother sounds very upset. 
[03:08:00]  You try to raise your kids.  You do your best.  I'm sure you did your best, didn't you, ma'am?  Yeah.  And look at what happens.  Oh, my God.  She's so upset.  I can't do this anymore.  I can't do this.  Ma!  Hey, ma!  Excuse me, ma'am.  Yeah?  Happy Mother's Day, ma!  It's not a joke.  This was the worst.  Oh, I'm going to burn in hell for this, man.  Oh, no.  Ma!  She's all right.  He's fine. 
[03:08:30]  He's not in jail.  It's only...  Ma, you're live on the radio.  You could smack him in the head.  Ma, you still there?  Yes.  Talk to us, ma.  Look how upset...  Oh, my God.  Dude.  I got to make a phone call.  Did you know she was going to get that upset?  No.  Oh, my God.  Usually I can joke with her, you know.  I'm always joking with her.  Oh, no.  I'm always joking with her.  Oh, we feel horrible now.  You've got to smooth things over and call us back, man.  All right.  All right, bro. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, no.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Bye.  Oh, no.  That one didn't work well.  Oh, my God.  Let's do it!  The O.P.  The O.P.  and Amity Show.

[03:13:30]  Nice.  He's hip.  Oh, he really is.  Or did he break one?  What?  Was he hip or hip replacement?  Well, because the rules don't pertain to him, Anthony.  Of course not. 
[03:14:00]  Shut up.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thank you, XM Satellite Radio.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for all you do for this program.  Thank you so much.  Anthony.  Yes.  You know, every day we're trying to bring back all the old elements of the program.  Yes, we are.  And slowly but surely, we're finding all our old stuff.  Things that kind of made the last program we did cute. 
[03:14:30]  It's like a little treasure hunt, isn't it?  Trying to find little things, little bits and pieces of our past.  Remember this clip?  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  Wow.  Oh, man.  I do remember that.  I forgot all about that one.  Thank you, whoever sent this in.  That's from the Ted Williams story.  Yes.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  I think we added in the music, though. 
[03:15:00]  No, we didn't.  That's how it was on CNN.  That's how it aired on the news?  Yeah, of course.  And then, of course, we got this added to the program today.  Come on.  You're a filthy whore!  Nice!  And we found this, Diddy.  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Oh, now those I will absolutely need on my machine.  Of course.  Eric's going to be updating our machines today.  Wow, you are a bear.  Ooh, that's a good one for Steve. 
[03:15:30]  And that's a brand new one.  Great.  You are a bear.  What's that from?  I don't know.  American Wedding.  American Wedding?  Ooh.  Stip work.  Watch any of those after the first one.  Stop.  They made one too many.  Too, too many.  Awful.  I love when a franchise makes one too many.  Whoops.  Ouch.  We thought it was going to work again.  Where's Bob Kelly?  Bob.  Pulling his junk out of the window again?  Oh, man. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, Bob Kelly just showed us his package.  We told him he couldn't come in until we started the break.  And then he pulled his pants down in front of the window.  And you saw my little, uh, looked like a little uncircumcised tsunami mule.  That was uncircumcised?  No.  I couldn't tell.  It was so small it was soft and sticking straight out.  Because I have, I have a...  Jimmy said it looked like a baby's body with hair.  Yeah, like a tall Lebanese child just... 
[03:16:30]  You mean it looked like you?  No.  Nothing.  Ah, I love those crickets.  0 for 1.  You know that car crash thing you play?  Yeah.  That's it, yeah.  First of all, that thing is just...  My manager calls me last night.  He's pissed.  He's like, those son of a bitches.  Those fucking O&A.  I'm in traffic driving in Connecticut.  I'm listening to this stupid show.  And I'm in stop and go traffic.  All of a sudden, they played that stupid car crash. 
[03:17:00]  I thought I got into an accident.  I thought that was my car.  Somebody just smashed into me.  I jumped.  I almost let go of the gas.  I almost smashed into the car in front of me.  He was pissed.  Yeah, when it's loud like that, it really sounds real when you're in your car.  It really is an annoying goddamn...  I don't like that he has such confidence in his appearance that he's just casually holding  his Starbucks as he's just talking to us.  And he's got his other hand down the front of his pants.  Look at you.  I'm trying to rub my mule so it gets a little bigger.  It was small, wasn't it? 
[03:17:30]  It was a little cold out there, wasn't it?  I actually...  My penis, my penis, my dick doesn't hold blood the way it used to.  Really?  Well, you have a...  Either you have a blood penis or a meat penis.  A shower or a grower.  Right.  Or you have a blood meat penis.  A blood meat penis is a huge dick.  Okay?  A blood penis is when the blood pumps to it, it gets to its full girth.  Right.  A meat penis is when it just hangs. 
[03:18:00]  It looks cool.  But what was yours?  But it doesn't get much bigger.  Mine used to be a blood penis.  Like it would...  I mean, mine used to be a meat penis where it would hang all the time.  But now it's just...  It actually is in the middle of...  Like, you know, it's to the left or to the right.  Actually, now it's right in the middle.  Like a little mushroom cap.  And it...  I had a problem last year when I was...  When I was fatter.  Because I lost 30 pounds.  I used to be... 
[03:18:30]  When I was heavier, I literally had...  I had a problem.  Because I don't think blood was getting down to my conch.  Really?  And it would actually pop in.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  I'd walk it on the street and I'd feel it pop in.  And I'd have to rub it to pop it back up.  Are you kidding?  Because blood wasn't getting down to my...  My...  My...  My...  My...  My...  My...  My...  My...  My dick.  So it would...  It would...  It would pop in.  It would pop...  I could feel it.  You'd feel like a like...  You could...  You could...  If there was a sound, that would be the sound, Anthony. 
[03:19:00]  And it would just kind of pop in.  And what would you...  I'd have to rub it and pop it back out.  Ugh.  I...  And I...  I'm like a genie making a wish.  I wish I had a cock like a man.  I think I'm...  The older you get, I think the...  Hey, look who's here for the conch conversation.  Uh...  Popped right in.  You could straighten that right out for him.  Couldn't you, son?  Jesus Christ.  Wait, get on...  Get on mic there, Noah.  This is Noah.  Oh, my...  Noah, how you doing?  He's our new intern.  I'm doing good.  And he likes to dress up for...  I don't know...  For his position here on the Opie and Anthony program.  Yeah, allegedly, I do. 
[03:19:30]  Show him the back of your shirt.  All right.  Show him what it says on the back.  Oh, why the back of your shirt?  Show him the back of your ass, son.  That's nice.  What does that say?  I don't know.  It's the money exchange.  It's just the way he stands with the jacket there.  Oh, dude, you are...  It's like he's modeling for something.  He's a good kid.  We really don't know what he is.  We're trying to figure it out.  He's gay.  Quite frankly.  He's gay.  I'll tell you right now.  I don't know about that.  You're gay.  You don't know you're gay yet?  Oh, you haven't come to terms with it yet?  But you're definitely...  I...  I never said anything.  You're gay.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  I'm looking at you.  Look it right at me. 
[03:20:00]  I'm looking right at you.  Look at me.  Yeah.  You're gay.  Well, I appreciate the comment, but I'm not going to say anything.  Listen, I know you're not going to say...  It's okay to be gay.  He's not going to say anything.  He had a girlfriend.  He had a girlfriend.  He likes Zeppelin, and he likes the Rolling Stones.  Yeah.  Norton likes Ozzy and had a girlfriend, and then, you know, he does like trannies, too,  every once in a while.  That's only being diplomatic.  I feel if I'm going to have a prostitute, you've got to spread the wealth a little bit.  I don't need trannies protesting.  I'm not a bigot.  You know, you all are saying I'm gay, but, you know...  I have not said you're gay. 
[03:20:30]  No one...  Hold on.  Let's go around the room.  I have not said you were gay.  I absolutely have not said you were gay.  Despite my inner thoughts, I've said nothing of the kind.  Maybe implications.  I mean, we say things behind your back when you're not listening, but we haven't said anything  on the air.  I really don't know what you are.  If you have any offers of any girls, I didn't say I would decline that either, so, you know...  Oh.  Ooh.  You know what?  I'm going to suck your cock right now to prove you're gay.  How's that sound?  I'm going to pass an offer, but I'm like, you know...  It took you two seconds to figure that out, though, didn't it?  We could bring back the old gag. 
[03:21:00]  We had a gay guy who really liked NSYNC so much that we had him kind of, you know, eat  out a girl for the tickets.  For the tickets, yeah.  He puked?  Oh, he was out of his mind, miserable.  He had to do it for the length of an NSYNC song.  That's one of the best bits we've ever done.  And he never saw a girl below the belt naked.  So, he pulled her panties down, and he started crying.  He was crying, going, what is that?  Like, he goes, stuff is hanging out.  He was petrified. 
[03:21:30]  Petrified.  He had to go down on a nice stink wrinkle.  Poor guy.  Yeah, it was awful for him.  Well, I mean, I just have to say, I'm a guy who likes to dress nice.  I mean, I don't think that means that, you know, necessarily that...  You know what, though?  I'm thinking people are making more than just the dressing.  Yeah, it's the hand on the hip, the Roman god lean you have on one ass cheek, the little  fingers on the table.  Yeah, there's little things, maybe. 
[03:22:00]  Some of the way you speak a little bit.  Well, I mean, okay, so I'm not a manly man, necessarily, but...  All right.  Well, what kind of man...  What other man is there?  See, there's a feminine man.  No, I didn't say a feminine man.  We asked if you would have sex with a guy if you had to, and he picked...  Like, what guy?  I picked Ozzy, and he picked Jude Law.  Jude Law.  That's such an obscure...  Right.  Who knows Jude Law?  You gave thought to it.  If any guy did...  If you were being tortured and had to come up with an answer, like, any guy would pull, 
[03:22:30]  like, a very popular guy's name out of his head.  You don't go for the Jude Law thing.  I think he's a pretty popular guy.  No, he's not.  You say Brad Pitt, every guy goes, yeah, I'd blow Brad.  Brad's hot.  No, every guy doesn't say that, Bob.  Yeah, well...  You're talking for yourself, Bob.  Sorry.  Jesus.  He's, like, in four movies right now.  He's been on the cover of People magazine.  I mean, he's a pretty popular guy.  He was voted sexiest man alive.  Exactly.  Uh-huh.  The fact that you know this, the fact that you read People...  No, he told me.  He told me.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry.  Well, you're going to talk about this.  Jimmy did this. 
[03:23:00]  And then we asked him again.  He goes, who else would you...  If you had a kiss and stuff.  I said if kissing had to be involved.  If kissing was involved.  And then he changed his answer, and...  Matt Damon.  Matt Damon.  I said Matt Damon.  Bob, who would it be for you if you had to kiss him?  If I had to kiss a guy?  Yeah.  It had to be kissing.  Intimately kissing.  Chin-holding.  Yeah, we all had answers yesterday.  I'd probably have to say...  An actor?  Brad Pitt.  So you would kiss and have sex with Brad Pitt?  I don't know if I'd have sex with...  I'd kiss Brad Pitt.  I might have sex with George Clooney. 
[03:23:30]  Because he'd be a little softer.  I think Brad would be like, you like that?  You like that?  And he'd go into a California role and start pulling the back of my ears.  Come on!  When I was given the choice, I think the choice of somebody who's palatable is better than  like Ozzy Osbourne for a kid.  Palatable?  Good word.  Yeah, good word, homo.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  I think it's a better choice than somebody than Ozzy Osbourne.  No, it's not.  You should never say...  It's a better choice.  That's what we're trying to say. 
[03:24:00]  Because you're making the real decision like he's got a great body.  I'm actually...  I'm willing to do it out of respect for the music.  Like, I wouldn't be gay because I'd be humming Iron Man the whole time.  There's nothing gay about him.  But that's nasty.  They call him Iron Man.  Ozzy's nasty.  I mean, have you seen him without a shirt on the shoulder?  Yes.  That's the fact that you're gay.  Right.  It's not about nasty.  It's not about if he's disgusting.  You're sucking a dick.  Who cares what he looks like?  It's a cock going in your mouth.  There's no pretty cock.  The fact that you'd rather have a great upper torso while you're sucking cock and a pretty... 
[03:24:30]  That's what makes you gay?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Bob just made a weird statement.  You're sucking cock?  It doesn't matter what he looks like.  Well, that proves that you're straight is what he's saying.  Well, if you have to look up and see pretty eyes and nice lips and a nice chin line, you  know, then that means you're gay.  If I had to suck a cock, I don't care if it was Norton's cock.  It doesn't...  It's a cock.  All right, put it in my mouth.  Get it off with.  Yeah, but if we're talking about sucking, I mean, people that old probably can't even 
[03:25:00]  get it up.  Can you say sucking again one more time?  Sucking.  There you go.  So you're saying that you'd prefer...  You're right.  Ozzy might not be able to get it up to do his medication.  Probably not.  So me, I'd have a little limp one in my mouth, but you would prefer one that is filled with  blood and engorged and almost angry.  Yeah.  Nice.  Because there's nothing worse than somebody holding your head and a soft one being shoved  in.  You want one that's going to make you go...  And a little tear come down like you're watching a midget get married.  You want a nice nine and a half cut. 
[03:25:30]  I think the old thing's repulsive.  I don't care what Ozzy did, I mean, I don't care if he was, you know, greatest rock star  legend in history.  Can I ask you a question?  Do you like cut or uncut?  Would you prefer clipped or unclipped?  I don't have an answer for that.  Yes, you do.  Yeah, you do.  I totally don't have an answer.  If you had to go down on a man, what would you rather prefer, cut or uncut?  Do you have an answer for that?  Yes.  I'm asking you.  I do, yes.  Okay.  What would your answer be?  But he asked you first.  I know.  Okay.  What's your answer?  I would have an answer.  Cut or uncut?  It's no big deal. 
[03:26:00]  What's your answer?  Well, I mean, I don't think, I don't think the European thing is very, uh...  The European thing?  Hmm.  That's an interesting way of saying it.  Well, let that...  Cut or uncut?  If you had to blow me or this big hump over here, Gavin, because he has a, oh, his mules.  We're in my gym, and this son of a bitch, I have a sauna for two people, and this guy's  five people, he's six, Gavin from England, six, five, like 300 pounds, just a massive 
[03:26:30]  man.  We go in the sauna, I'm in my shorts, and my t-shirt, like American men do when you're  in a sauna with another man.  Yeah.  He walks in fully nude, those English weirdos, and his huge snuffleupagus, tricolored frigging  mule.  Oh, it had, like, three different colors, the base was, and then the middle, and then  the end of the little snout.  Yeah, but can I ask, why were you looking, and how do you know so much detail?  English guard's hat.  How do I, because I'm a man.  But how do you know so much detail? 
[03:27:00]  Because a man walks in with a big mule, uncut, I'm going to look at it to tell my other friends.  I mean, I might get...  That's why.  Plus, when you're Gavin's height, you can't help it, it's dangling in your face.  Yeah.  I mean, I might...  I'm 5'8", look at him.  I might be able to help a glance, I'm going to look up and not look at it, you know?  He sat on the stoop above me, it was resting on my shoulder.  And it said, Bert.  Bert.  So, cut or uncut?  What were you saying?  Well, I would say cut, I mean...  Cut.  Of course, yes.  Because you just...  To be honest with you, you'd probably say that that looks a lot better than the, like, 
[03:27:30]  as you say, the European look.  It's more appealing to the eye, right?  Well, I guess so.  Do you know if Queer Eye for the Straight Guy came in to do something on you, they just come  in and go, finished.  That's the quickest show ever.  You're wearing tight jeans, a tight shirt, a tight hat.  You're wearing glasses in the day.  Gucci.  Gucci sunglasses.  Everything is...  And you have to show the Gucci belt.  Everything is an ad for, like, look at me, I shop great, Bloomingdale's.  I mean, either you're gay or you have shitty jokes like Rich Voss. 
[03:28:00]  That's the only other tight-clothed asshole I know.  Well, we really don't know for sure, so we're trying to figure it out there, Bob.  Thank you for helping us out.  I'm up in the air on him.  I'm really up in the air on this one.  To be honest with you.  I'm not saying he's not, but I'm not convinced either, because there are guys that are kind  of like, you know, like, you go, oh, he's gay, and all of a sudden, like, no, he's really  like, like, there are certain people that may work for XM that I assumed were gay, and all  of a sudden they're married.  I'm like, oh, okay, I guess he's not gay.  But I'm putting an offer on the table. 
[03:28:30]  I want to take you to, I want to go with him to a, I'll go with you to a gay club.  I got to help you out, though, just in case you're not.  Take your hands off your hips when you're talking.  Yeah, exactly.  That whole hands on hips.  It's just a nervous thing.  Now, listen to me.  Unless you're, stuttering is a nervous thing.  Hands on the hips and ass tilted out is not a nervous thing.  Yeah.  Unless you're a superhero or you're sucking cock, you should never do that.  That's good.  Dun-da-da-da!  Able to kneel in small rest areas.  He has an S on his thing for suck. 
[03:29:00]  You know, I like the way he laughs, too.  He, like, covers his nose like a British woman.  There is just all kinds of things going on there.  And the girlfriend situation, you haven't had one in three months, are you saying?  Is that what it was?  No, it was more than that.  How long ago did you have a girlfriend?  How long ago?  It was about a year ago.  On the mic.  A year.  You haven't had a girlfriend in a year?  In a year.  Okay.  In a year, yeah. 
[03:29:30]  So you haven't had any sexual contact in a year?  That's not true.  What was his name?  Okay.  You've had some sexual contact.  Yes.  With?  With girls I met at bars.  One-night stands?  One-night stands.  Nice.  What was the last one you met at a bar?  Not her name, but what happened?  What bar?  What bar?  The bar was Central Bar.  Okay.  And it's on the east side.  And it was around.  There will always be a question.  The question we ask, you will always repeat it. 
[03:30:00]  That's right.  What bar?  What bar?  What bar?  And it was around the end of the winter semester.  So it was at the end of the winter.  All right.  What'd she look like?  What'd she look like?  She had blonde hair.  She was a little taller than me.  Green eyes.  Good figure.  Good figure?  You're describing yourself in drag.  Stop.  I'm a little taller than you.  What was she?  5'3"?  So she had a good figure, and you met her apparently in 1951.  Yeah, seriously. 
[03:30:30]  Either you're gay or you have a time machine.  So you met her, and how did you hook up in the bar?  Just got pretty drunk, and that was...  Got pretty drunk, and then what?  You went over and started talking to her?  Yeah.  Were you alone or with friends?  I was with friends, but I kind of broke off.  With friends you broke off?  Did you have a car with you?  No.  How'd you get around?  Well, we're in New York City.  Just walk around.  New York City?  So you just walk around.  Did you take her back to your place?  No, I went back to her place.  Went back to her place.  Where was it?  Her place was around Penn Station.  Penn Station. 
[03:31:00]  So she was a little taller with blonde hair.  Your hands are on your hips again.  Take it off.  Yeah, stop.  All right.  She maybe looked like...  Who'd she remind you?  Like maybe Vince Neil.  I mean, who did she kind of beside your uncle?  A little taller with blonde hair.  What was her name?  First name.  First name.  I never got a name.  Wait, wait.  Not even a first name?  Never got a name.  Never got a name.  Never got a name.  That doesn't happen.  I've banged over a hot...  Two hundred...  Three thousand chicks I've banged.  I've touched my ding-ding.  I know all their names.  I know what they look like.  I'll describe what their vaginas, fat labias, big clits. 
[03:31:30]  You son of a bitch.  Whoa, whoa.  Which girl said fat labias and big clits?  I told you.  I don't get names.  And you don't even know her first name.  No, I don't get names and I'll leave in the middle of the night.  Girls don't do that.  Because he's a man's man, Anthony.  He doesn't need the name and he'll leave in the middle of the night.  There you go.  Boy, you sure got Jude Law's name, didn't you?  You pulled that out of the thin air.  So even talking to her in the bar, you didn't get her name?  Nope.  Nope.  And you were able to ask her, what did you say, let's go?  I probably got her name.  I probably forgot it after the morning.  Hey, I forgot her name. 
[03:32:00]  Fucking slut.  Oh!  I don't need...  Hey, you know what her name is?  Hey, you.  Suck this here.  Oh!  You are like the manliest man ever.  Hey, honey, I'd like to hang out, but I true my goo already.  I gotta go.  What's your name?  I don't care, bitch.  Hickory dickory duck.  I wish you had a cock. 
[03:32:30]  Jack be nimble.  Jack be quick.  You gotta pussy.  I like dick.  Oh!  Little Jack Horner.  I fucked him.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[03:33:00]  You are a man's man.  Yeah, sure.  Gotta tell you.  His hands are back on his hips.  Take your hands off the hips.  Playing Simon Says.  I'm gonna let you guys leave what you want.  No, we don't really know.  I don't know.  All we can go on is what you're telling us,  and the story seems a bit far-fetched.  You meet this blonde, blue-eyed,  like the fantasy girl of any guy.  You take her back to her place.  You don't even know her name. 
[03:33:30]  You bang her and leave.  I didn't say she was that good-looking.  I didn't say she was a fantasy girl.  Nice figure, blonde hair, blue eyes.  Yeah, and she lived around Penn Station, you said.  Yeah.  What floor?  What floor did she live on?  It was the fifth floor, I believe.  So you remember that, but not her name.  You remember her floor, but not her name.  Fifth floor.  Who lives at Penn Station?  It's all Puerto Rican 99 cent stores, you jackass.  30th Street.  And Asian massage parlors.  What blonde, blue-eyed girls are living there.  He said 30th Street.  He said 30th Street. 
[03:34:00]  30th Street is actually a really nice apartment.  Fifth floor, 30th Street.  Yes.  Don't remember her name.  I don't ask names.  Between what and what?  Between what?  It was between 8th and 9th.  8th and 9th?  8th and 9th.  Really?  I think that's a little easier for you to say,  if you're saying between 8th and 9th.  You said on the East Side.  You did say on the East Side.  On the East Side?  No, I totally did not.  You were so sad on the East Side.  You said the bar was on the East Side.  The bar's on the East Side.  And then his apartment was by Penn Station.  Now you got him.  You're not going to get me to slip up. 
[03:34:30]  Slip up.  He just said you're not going to get me to slip up.  Right.  That's right.  Ah, you friggin' son of a bitch.  So you then slept with this girl.  That's right.  Had sex with her.  Yeah.  And then left.  Yeah.  In the middle of the night.  You didn't hang out?  Nope.  Now why didn't you hang out?  Because I didn't feel comfortable.  You didn't feel comfortable?  I kind of sobered up.  No, I kind of sobered up and said,  where the hell am I?  And decided to take a cab and go back to my place.  You know what?  I do like those jeans.  Uh-oh, you're a girl. 
[03:35:00]  Those jeans are hot, dude.  Thank you.  Yeah, you're gay.  A real man would say, what are you, a fag?  He said, thank you.  I appreciate that.  I'm a nice guy.  Well, Bob is convinced.  The rest of us, we're really not sure.  We're not sure.  Absolutely.  I'm not going to say definitely is.  We'll keep, you know, we'll keep probing, if I may use the term.  And quite frankly, we don't really care if you are.  No.  We're just trying to figure it out.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with it.  Absolutely not.  No.  If you're gay, so what?  We don't care.  If you're not, you're not.  Big deal.  I don't like either way, any more or less.  We just like, you know, knowing who we're working with. 
[03:35:30]  Well, I appreciate it.  But I would say, you can ask my roommates, and you can talk to the people that I know.  Yeah, we do have phone numbers of your roommates.  You can find out a little bit more about me.  Maybe we'll do that next time he comes in.  Oh, isn't that?  Oh, that's right.  What's the name of that book?  Noah Has a Roommate, right?  Yeah.  Heather has two mommies.  Yeah.  All right.  Noah, bye.  Noah, thank you.  Thank you.  Good talking to you.  Bye, baby bitch.  There he goes.  Just bye.  Bye. 
[03:36:00]  Noah, bye.  Bye.  Wow.  Wow.  We love the kid.  He gives us great radio, man.  You know something?  He comes off as very feminine.  Right.  He is so gay.  We don't know.  There is no one gayer.  That's your opinion, Bob.  No, listen to me.  I walked in.  I've been listening.  You've been talking about him.  I knew it was him the second I walked in.  I just started laughing as he walked by. 
[03:36:30]  Well, look at the rest of us.  We barely shower.  Because you're men.  There should be dirty balls and dirty ass in here.  And bad breath.  And one man that enjoys that.  Listen, we've got to take a quick break, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  We've got Bob Kelly in studio.  Oh, wow.  That's not it.  What hope?  What happened to no admitted homosexual thing?  Oh, man.  I want to play this one more time.  No, that's the other thing.  Damn it.  Man.  Eric, help Hope find that, please.  Look. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Oh, can I have a piece of gum, Bob?  I threw it on your pile.  I threw it on your pile.  Let's see.  He said green eyes.  And every time you said blue eyes, he never corrected you.  That coming in from Mike from North Jersey.  We've got a lot of detectives on the case, by the way.  That's right.  Oh, I'd love to catch this son of a bitch down in the meatpacking district.  Yeah, that'd be pretty embarrassing if he was driving around.  You know I caught him one night, right?  Yeah, we can talk about that again next. 
[03:37:30]  We like talking about things over and over again, so we'll bring that up again.  I'm sure it'll be in an email later.  Hey, guys, you already covered that four months ago.  Drop dead, you picky fuck listener.  Hey, you already covered that.  Let me think over it again.  I need fresh material.  This is C-Rock.  Something called Noah, admitted homosexual.  There's a lot of inaccuracies in this following piece.  Of course.  Making him seem very, very gay.  Noah, admitted homosexual.  It's a bit on the feminine side. 
[03:38:00]  A lot of telltale signs.  Questionable about my sexuality.  I have to be honest, I woke up late.  I didn't take time to pick out my outfit.  So I went to a psychiatrist who told me that I was a woman trapped in a man's body.  Do you shave your chest?  Yes, I do.  Do you shave your butt crack, too, so nobody gets chafed?  Yes, I do.  I got a question for Noah.  Ricky Martin fan?  Yes.  Admitted homosexual.  What celebrity would you have sex with?  God, that's a hard one.  I don't know.  I'd say Jude Law is a good-looking guy.  Jude Law?  Admitted homosexual. 
[03:38:30]  What is it that made you pick him?  He's decent-looking.  I don't see anything wrong with that answer.  Admitted homosexual.  So you'd have sex with Jude Law.  Jude Law.  So Jude Law, you had to pick a second choice, but there had to be kissing involved.  I guess.  All right, I guess I would go with Matt Damon, I would say.  Matt Damon.  Admitted homosexual.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton. 
[03:39:00]  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages.  Savages.  That run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  What road against the wall?  I'm not down against the divas.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee. 
[03:39:30]  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  That's his first tour.  Big Ten Basketball.  It's the Big Ten today on XM Satellite Radio.  It's Thursday, January 27th, 2005.  I'm Maggie Linton with the Big Ten today.  Big Ten!  Two conference heavyweights put records on the line Tuesday night.  And top-ranked Illinois won the battle 75-65 over 18th-ranked Wisconsin, 
[03:40:00]  who had the nation's longest home court win streak at stake.  The final score is deceiving because at one point the Badgers actually led the Illini by eight  with plays like this.  Williams inbounds.  Here's the lob to Powell.  Broken up Wilkinson.  Messes up the dump.  Loose ball picked up by Chambliss.  Here's Sheree to the front court.  Feeds Tucker for the lead.  Right side!  Got it!  Alando Tucker splashes a three.  Badgers lead by three.  Still looks. 
[03:40:30]  He'll throw it out front.  Picked off by Dee Brown on the run.  Out two Badgers in pursuit.  Brown down the lane.  Layup blocked by Nixon.  Loose ball picked up by Taylor.  Lead feed Tucker.  Down the lane.  Layup good.  Oh my goodness, what a turn of events.  Back and forth they go.  49-44 Wisconsin.  And it was Alando Tucker who led the Wolverines with 16, but Illinois proved to be too much.  Luther Head was high point man with 18, but Jack Ingram's clutch play down the stretch sealed the deal.  Williams high on the left. 
[03:41:00]  He's McBride.  Jumped past Ingram for three again.  Right side.  Good again.  Jack Ingram.  His second three here in the last minute.  61-58 Illinois.  All cuts courtesy Badger Radio Network from Learfield Sports.  This was Wisconsin's first Big Ten home loss under coach Bo Ryan in four seasons, falling to 53-3 at home.  The Badgers will return to the court on Friday when they travel to Penn State.  Wisconsin's average margin of victory during their home win streak was 20.4 points per game. 
[03:41:30]  And that's the Big Ten today on XM Satellite Radio.  Big Ten!  Big Ten!  XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Having a lot of fun today.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  We got Adam Dirtz on the phone.  I didn't even know that he was calling in today. 
[03:42:00]  Lead singer of the Counting Crows, Adam.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi.  Big star like you.  We should have been promoting this all morning long.  I apologize to you.  Dude, it's all right.  It's all good, right?  I was asleep anyways.  I wouldn't have heard.  Are you in L.A.?  No, no.  I'm in New York.  Oh.  Well, isn't it time to get out of bed?  Um, nah.  Rock stars don't get out of bed.  I was out kind of late.  I don't know.  Hey, congratulations on the nomination.  Thank you.  Accidentally in Love featured on Shrek 2, the soundtrack, nominated for an Oscar. 
[03:42:30]  That's got to be cool.  That's right.  I was nominated for an Oscar.  Are they going to allow you to sing the song?  I don't know.  I hope so.  Allow you.  No, I'm not kidding.  A lot of times in the past with the Oscars and some of these nominated songs, the people  that actually sang the song don't get to perform it.  There was a whole story about, I think it goes back to Phil Collins or something, where  Phil Collins wasn't allowed to sing his own song because people didn't really know  who Phil Collins was.  I swear to God.  Really?  So they got someone else to sing the song.  That's ridiculous. 
[03:43:00]  I hope they're not feeling like making it up to Phil Collins this year.  I really got Phil Collins to sing my song.  Dude, I haven't seen the film, but I was talking to my buddy, and I'm like, how is Shrek  2?  And he goes, the music is really good.  And I'm like, you like the soundtrack?  And he's like, yeah.  And I'm like, all right.  It's kind of a cool soundtrack, actually.  Like, for a big studio movie, they kind of got a lot of unknown bands.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Cool, like, sort of underground-y bands.  Hey, who are you up against in that category?  Andrew Lloyd Webber is one of them, I think, for Final of the Opera. 
[03:43:30]  What's he done?  And then, what else is there?  Come on, you have to know.  I think from that French movie with Corey, I think.  Oh, I can't win.  And then, uh...  Who are you most nervous about?  Just all the hot chicks.  Dude, what are you going to do if you win an Oscar?  I got to think that you got into music thinking you would never be in line for an Oscar, right?  You don't just carry it around with me everywhere whenever I go out at night.  Yeah, that's probably the coolest thing to have. 
[03:44:00]  You already get to bang hot chicks, so I can't imagine this is going to make it even better.  You don't think?  Put an Oscar out there when you take a girl home?  But, dude, I mean...  Or go to her place if you don't remember her name?  I don't know, just sort of a conversation piece.  I'd wear it around my neck like a rapper.  Look at me.  Put a big chain through it.  And you actually, in between, you actually were bartending at the Viper Room just to  kind of stay down to earth at one point?  No, I don't really stay down to earth. 
[03:44:30]  It was the only people I knew in L.A. were the people that ran the Viper Room, so it  was just less crowded on that side of the bar.  It was kind of fun.  This is why I asked you, because my friend went to the Viper Room, and I had been there  one time many years ago, and he's like, I saw the guy from County Crows.  I'm like, where?  He's like, bartending at the Viper Room.  I'm like, get out of here.  He's like, no, really?  I wasn't really trying to earn regular guy points.  No, I don't know.  I would imagine you're kind of doing that celebrity bartending thing, right? 
[03:45:00]  You know, there were a few people I knew in L.A., and I just moved there.  It was before he was a celebrity.  Oh, it was before the County Crows hit?  No, no, it was after.  Oh, it was after?  Okay.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, I have no clue then.  Things got a little chaotic in Berkeley.  I couldn't really leave the house at the time, so I moved down to L.A., but I didn't  really know anybody.  So, it was just kind of left crowded over there, and you meet a lot of people bartending.  It's kind of fun.  Adam, do you kiss and tell?  Because I'm reading some of the girls you've dated. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  Courtney Cox?  That's quite a resume.  Yeah?  And, you know.  Never heard of her.  No?  Jennifer Aniston?  Saw her on TV the other day.  Nicole Kidman?  Okay, look, I've never even met her.  Kathy Bates?  You know, it's fucking...  Jude Law?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can curse.  It's satellite radio.  Yeah, I can't believe you slept with Kathy Bates.  That's amazing.  Is that the woman in misery? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  But if you really want to see her, you've got to see about Schmidt, because she does a  nude scene.  It's very hot.  Well, you know, I didn't ask her name, and I left early.  So I don't know.  Oh, he heard that.  Yeah, he heard the bit.  Hey, let me say about Nicole Kidman, man.  If you dated her, me and my friend were watching a movie, and he's like, dude, how hot is she?  And I'm like, please, tell me about it.  I thoroughly agree.  I've never met her.  I read...  Come on.  I mean, I'm telling you, sometimes they just make it up. 
[03:46:30]  And Nicole Kidman, they made up?  I've never even met her.  Adam, take some advice from us.  If someone's saying you've banged Nicole Kidman in your past, just go with it.  Yeah.  What do I care?  That's a good name to have on your resume, man.  I'm telling you.  I've had a good life.  I don't have to make them up.  Yeah, that's true.  I was at the Golden Globes like a week ago, and Nicole Kidman was there, and I thought  about walking up and saying, hey, hey, me and you, but we didn't. 
[03:47:00]  And she said, yeah.  I chickened out on it.  I thought I should go up and introduce myself since I'd read about how I might have dated  her.  Yeah.  I've got to be honest, Adam.  You're the first guy ever nominated for an Oscar that I've ever spoken to.  That's nice.  How am I doing?  No, no.  My question is, do you, before the awards, actually have a speech written?  I don't know.  I've never been to the office.  No, no, no.  I'm saying because you're nominated. 
[03:47:30]  Do you have an acceptance speech, just in case you win, already written?  Oh, do I?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, like who are you going to thank?  I don't know.  You know what I would do?  I'm waiting for the first person to go up there and just go, I want to thank me, because  it was all about me.  I just want to thank God for liking me a little better than everybody else.  Yep.  Yeah, exactly.  I hate when they thank God.  Adam, I remember one year, me and my friend are watching the Oscars, and like every time  somebody wins, they have a speech written, and I'm like, do you think they write them 
[03:48:00]  beforehand?  He's like, dude, I got no idea.  I don't know.  I can't see you writing a speech.  No, you'll just go up there and wing it, right?  It seems really...  Man, the biggest problem with thank...  I always hate thank yous on a record, because it's not a matter of remembering who you thank.  What you get in trouble for is the one person you forgot.  Yep.  And then they are just a jerk for the rest of the year.  And then how about the records out there now forever, and then how about the people you  thank that you can't stand after a while? 
[03:48:30]  You know, and then it's like you're thanking them on this album, and meanwhile, you hate  them.  You know, I kind of want to go dig out some of our old records now and see who I can't  stand on the record.  See who you thanked.  Yeah.  What's going on with the Counting Crows?  Nothing right now.  You guys are done, basically, you think?  No, no.  We just came off five years on the road.  I'm like...  I'm burnt out for a little while.  So you're just taking a break from that?  Yeah, yeah.  So what are you doing now? 
[03:49:00]  How do you occupy your time?  I got drunk last night.  I don't know.  It was fun.  Picked up some girl.  Took her to Penn Station.  I'm not doing a whole lot right now.  My mom's been visiting all week.  That's been kind of fun.  Cool.  Wow.  You're a rock star, and you really don't have anything to do.  You know, there's no hockey right now.  It's hockey time.  There's no hockey.  I love my hockey, but at this point, I just don't care.  Dude, that lockout, man. 
[03:49:30]  It's like people are starting to say that this is going to end the whole season.  My friend thinks so, too.  No, you know they're coming back.  I don't know.  I'm not a big hockey fan.  Like, when I was a kid, I played baseball.  And, you know, back then, it was just different.  Okay.  Hey, Adam, you want to...  You know what?  If you're in New York...  There was, but...  If you're in New York and you have nothing to do, you should come on by and, you know,  hang with us.  We have a really good time here every morning.  Yeah, the morning things are stretched for me. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  I understand.  Well, just stay up.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you be out with your Oscar nomination?  Just, you know...  That's the night before.  Yeah.  But, I mean, you probably, you know, hey, I'm Oscar nominated.  You hang out at the bars, and that's when you have your fun, not during the morning.  Yeah, I think it's going to really pay off if you win.  Mm-hmm.  True.  Yeah, they need to go to the bar with you, Oscar.  I'll certainly be tucking it under my arm and heading out to the bars.  I'd be stirring my drinks in the bar with Oscar's head.  Yeah.  You know, just clink, clink, clink, clink, yeah.  Oh, no, that's my swizzle stick. 
[03:50:30]  It's an Oscar.  Big balls in my pants?  Yes, it's...  You know, funny to mention it.  Oscar.  That's my Oscar.  Oscar in your pants.  Dude, I've never won an award in my life.  It's an honor just to be nominated.  When I was a kid, I ran a race with my father.  We did, like, a one-mile race, and just to, like, be a nice guy, he made me a little  trophy because I finished the one-mile race.  Can you keep it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the only thing I ever...  Like, I've never gotten a trophy before.  You still got it?  Actually, no.  It's at my parent's house.  Because you can, you know, stay down to the bar. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, but nobody would care.  It was just, like, a sentimental thing.  But, I mean, the Oscar...  Tell him it's a golden globe.  Uh, what's that?  Tell him it's a golden globe.  Nah, it's just got, like, a little guy running on it.  Nobody would believe that.  It's so sad.  He's got a little man with breasts and a weak chin.  What a sad trophy you got.  Oh, it's awful.  You've got the saddest trophy ever.  I have a dumpy trophy.  All right, Adam, we're going to let you go because we've got to wrap up this radio program  here.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  It was great talking to you.  Good luck, man, at the Oscars.  Accidentally in Love featured on Shrek 2, the soundtrack, and nominated for an Oscar. 
[03:51:30]  Thanks, guys.  Good luck, man.  Thanks, Adam.  All right, there he goes.  Adam Dirtz from The Counting Crows.  That's a cool guy.  You can't hang up the phone?  Yeah, remember?  That was a problem today.  Oh, my God.  Give me a two-fun.  I love that new bit.  I just love it.  I get to the bottom of the issues, though.  You certainly do.  I love that.  Now, I can't wait to read.  I'm sure somebody will go, how come Norton's just ruining the interview? 
[03:52:00]  Relax.  Stop reading that stuff.  No, I don't, actually.  It gets emailed to me.  Oh, really?  I love these sadistic listeners.  If there's a nasty post, they'll send you a link.  What's this about?  They learn well from us.  Everyone is a dick out there.  Ah, they're showing the Katie Couric teen sex.  Teens and sex.  The 411.  You're trying to be so hip on NBC News.  The 411.  Teens and sex.  How hot is this show? 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  Look at that.  Teens talking about sex is the best.  Yeah.  Look at those lips.  Yeah.  What is wrong with teens experimenting with sex?  Nothing.  I mean, what is wrong?  They're all raising their hands.  They must be asking, how many of you have given BJs?  How many of you have talked to Jim Norton online?  Little young hands going up.  Look at that little lad with tussleable hair.  Oh, he's got like that really cool British hairdo.  I bet you know I wouldn't like that, though, because he kind of falls in his eyes.  Right, right.  He's got a little zit chin from shaving before it's time to shave. 
[03:53:00]  Fingerprints are all over Michael Jackson's coffee table books.  The boy.  The boy.  You know, we're never going to get to the HBO Dwarf special audio.  I know.  That's a teaser.  You can't start now.  It's so late.  Yeah, but we have to do when Bob's here.  I know.  Can you come back, Bob?  I can't believe I'm asking you to come back.  Why?  He had some great stuff today.  This is the first time I've ever asked you to come back.  Bob has some great stuff today.  Hope he really, anytime I've been here, he's like, all right, thanks a lot.  Like, it's my last time ever.  He really does give you a... 
[03:53:30]  I can't believe I'm actually saying, Bob, please come back.  Why?  I know the first time I was on the show, I had a hard time.  Now he's all casual.  I know.  He holds his coffee cup.  Holds his coffee cup nicely.  I'll back you up.  Looking all confident.  The first time I was in here, you had a wiffle ball bat in a girl's vagina.  Yes.  You did well the first time, is it?  I said a couple words.  No, you were fine.  Yeah, it was fine, but still, it was a little...  When can you come back?  Tomorrow.  No, not tomorrow. 
[03:54:00]  Monday?  No.  Look at me.  Not Monday.  When can I come back?  Keep going.  Anytime.  Tuesday?  Oh, you son of a bitch.  How about next Wednesday?  Oh, my God.  Well, that's the day we get back from...  Oh, yeah.  We're going to be a little tired.  We're actually gone on the first Monday.  How about maybe Thursday?  Hey, any...  A week from today.  No, but I got to fly out of town, then.  Oh.  I want to be here on Bobby's house.  Of course.  And then Friday, I'm gone.  I'm in Pittsburgh.  Norton's like, I don't want him here when I'm not here.  But then we're in New Orleans. 
[03:54:30]  Right.  Hey, how about this?  Before you set me up for this fucking shithead bit that I'm just catching wind of now.  You motherfuckers.  You're gay.  Listen.  Don't look at me like that unless you're going to suck it.  Yeah, I get what you...  Whenever you want.  How's that?  I'll be there.  I'm at your disposal.  All right.  You're just sitting and waiting for that phone to ring.  Yeah, I know.  It's going to ring, you son of a bitches.  Ah.  You motherfuckers.  Motherfuckers.  I'm sitting here like, yeah, Tuesday, Wednesday.  I'm looking at my calendar. 
[03:55:00]  You walked right into that, though.  Come on in.  I think Bob is very funny.  Last time you were on, I listened to the replay on the way home and the stories about holding  the rock over the retard's head.  The classic stories.  I enjoy when Bob comes on the show.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Absolutely.  So when would you like him back, Anthony?  Anytime.  I'm not getting sucked into this shit again.  He was good acting, too, by the way.  All three of you.  That was really good acting.  I was really bought into that.  I'll tell you what.  When your slong pops back out, you show up. 
[03:55:30]  Geez, I'm working on that right now, Anthony.  All right.  That was only when you were heavier, though?  That happened?  Actually, my penis is going back to...  But if you noticed, it looked like it was a little hanging.  It was stuck in a little bit.  But when I was really fat, it used to go inside.  Like fat was piling up in your pubic area where it would be puffy.  I think it was because I was heavy and the blood didn't go down.  But it actually went inside like my dick went away. 
[03:56:00]  That is bizarre.  Oh, it was awful.  It was awful.  Like I'd walk down the street and just...  And it would go in and I'd have to constantly rub my dick to have it pop back out.  And it became a habit.  So I would be at a store looking at...  And all of a sudden, I'd just start rubbing my cock to have it pop...  And it was like I didn't even know I was doing it.  Unbelievable.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  I have a nice penis.  Right, Jim? 
[03:56:30]  I've never seen your awful penis.  Ask Noah.  So just now when you showed it through the window and it was atrocious.  It did look like an alien's nose.  Yeah.  Who threw cold water on your back as you did that?  Speaking.  Hey.  All right.  Well, should we play...  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony program?  Very educational program today.  It was?  Yes.  Thank you.  All right, Bob.  You come back.  I think we'll be tired, so we'll ride him.  How about Wednesday?  Do whatever day you want. 
[03:57:00]  No, because honestly, Voss is sitting in for him tomorrow, and that's going to be awful  enough.  And then Monday and Tuesday, we're going to be in Washington.  So seriously, Wednesday, we're back here.  Wednesday?  So come on in Wednesday.  All right.  Wednesday's perfect.  Wednesday, we'll finally do the HBO Dwarf audio with Bob Kelly.  I'm writing for the Oscars.  Oh, that's what we're going to have to deal with tomorrow.  Fast Freddy.  He learned Noah doesn't concern himself with girls' names.  Doughboy from Whackbag.com.  He learned unless you're a superhero or sucking cock, you shouldn't have your hand on your hip. 
[03:57:30]  Chris from New Orleans.  Today, I learned the show is like a treasure hunt.  Boner from Jersey.  Today, I learned that while most shows use their promos to advertise their show, ONA used  their show to advertise their promos.  Yes.  Potsy from Glenhead.  I learned that you have to suck someone's dick to prove that they are gay.  Also, if you're straight and you're sucking cock, it doesn't matter how the cock looks.  What did we say?  Wednesday?  You coming back?  Motherfuckers.  Yes.  Are you guys fucking with me?  Not you. 
[03:58:00]  You got me.  I love that story.  That is tragic.  Oh, those big juicy juleps.  Not you.  Ugh.  Brother Scott learned...  Oh, this is my brother from South Hold.  He learned today Gene Simmons is too old to be a Steve's shirt starter.  Uh-huh.  Mickey Biggs from WhackBag.com.  Today, I learned the myth of the wild rock stars died just before the Counting Crows.  15 minutes, we're up. 
[03:58:30]  Does that make sense?  Yeah.  Sort of.  Someone's mad that it's Counting Crows, Opie, and not The Counting Crows.  Whatever.  They're very angry at that.  You have to say The Counting Crows, no?  I also say The Who, and someone said it's Who.  Officially, it's Who?  Is it?  No, it's not.  It's The Who.  The Who.  All right.  I don't know.  Well, I used to hate when people would call Kiss the Kiss.  The Kiss.  The Kiss, yes.  I don't mind, though, when they call Gene the douche.  That's perfect.  Hey, Jim from South Carolina. 
[03:59:00]  What did you learn on the show today?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I learned black criminals from Alabama are called pretty boys.  Uh-huh.  And I learned that Anthony's Neil Diamond impression sounds nothing like Bruce Springsteen.  Hey, that's very good.  I haven't done my Neil in a while.  Rob on Long Island.  What's going on, guys?  How you doing?  First, I want to say, Jimmy, I'm very proud of you of hiring these two guys for the Norton  and Friends show.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, I thought they had talent, and I brought them on board.  Yeah.  Show starts at 7 a.m.  I learned that for $100 million Norton would broadcast from his grandmother's underpants. 
[03:59:30]  Ah, good one.  Punch it out, guys.  Bye, fella.  All right.  Oh, this is pretty good.  Brian from Jersey learned Jim Norton's 20-year comedy career is defined by whores, monster  reign, and a trophy from his father.  Oh, yeah.  We didn't get into this, but Ben writes, today I learned you could blame your third-grade  teacher for wanting to kill your kids.  Yeah, what did the third-grade teacher do to that lady?  I missed the beginning of that audio when I taped it.  I never knew.  Good one.  I didn't catch the beginning. 
[04:00:00]  The whole thing that made her crazy, and we have no clue what it is.  Let's go to Matt in Buffalo.  Matt?  Hi, guys.  I learned that if Bob's penis is a shadow, we're going to have winter for another four months.  Punching out.  Punching out.  All right.  We want to thank Bob Kelly for stopping on by.  Thank you, guys.  We'll see him next Wednesday.  We'll do the HBO Dwarf audio finally.  Right, Anthony?  Absolutely.  Get some of the plug, Bob?  At RobertKelleyLive.com.  Program complete.
