<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a crude description of a photograph, followed by a detailed and derogatory commentary on the physical appearance of a man attempting to enter a taxi.  This transitioned into a studio visit by Paul Stanley of KISS.  The conversation with Stanley covered his solo career, his experiences within KISS (including band member relationships), past romantic entanglements, reunion tours, and KISS merchandise.  Jimmy shared an embarrassing childhood encounter with Stanley, and Opie recounted a bizarre childhood fantasy involving the band.  Following this, a heated argument erupted with Ben Stein, who took offense to Anthony's use of the phrase "chew down the price," interpreting it as anti-Semitic.  Stein hung up, only to call back for further contentious discussion. This sparked a series of increasingly offensive and anti-Semitic jokes and impersonations by the hosts, targeting Stein, Nixon, and Kissinger. The segment concluded with the hosts playing several vintage cigarette commercials, highlighting their misleading and racially charged nature and briefly touching on the health consequences of smoking.

The show then delved into a discussion about old and new cigarette advertisements, stemming from a song about smoking's consequences.  The hosts diverged into a critique of *The Flintstones*, discussing the female characters' attractiveness and the deaths of the voice actors. A caller, Dan, initially called to discuss a John Wayne cigarette advertisement but the conversation shifted to John Wayne's potential exposure to nuclear testing and his cancer death. Dan abruptly hung up.  The hosts then played an audio clip of a woman being tased while singing "Sweet Home Alabama," leading to further tangents about the deaths of actors in a fictional film (possibly mistaken for a Western) and the perceived technological illiteracy of older generations, using their mothers' aversion to new technology as an example.  This segued into a lengthy satire of President George W. Bush's perceived lack of internet familiarity, focusing on his use of "the Internets" and "the Google," and imagining his potential online activities.  This segment concluded with more jokes about Bush and internet usage and a humorous promotional announcement.

The broadcast then discussed a Dateline segment featuring Seth Cook, a child with Progeria. The hosts and callers repeatedly made jokes about Cook's appearance and condition, mocking the segment's tone and arguing it was exploitative.  Audio clips from Dateline were played alongside sarcastic commentary and listener calls adding to the often crude and insensitive jokes about Cook's life and struggles.

Later, the show shifted to a critique of Metallica ringtones, which the hosts found to be of extremely poor quality. They criticized the voiceovers and overall concept, expressing disbelief that Metallica would produce such subpar material. The show concluded with a discussion of a Scott Muni broadcast from the 1977 New York City blackout, playing audio of Muni broadcasting from the Empire State Building during the chaos. The hosts joked about the situation, contrasting Muni's dedication with the city's pandemonium.  Further discussion about the Metallica ringtones and listener calls followed, bringing the broadcast to a close.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is Sports Radio 1140 KSFM.  Some people don't like you to mention certain things.  Some people don't want you to say this.  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things they might happen.  Some people are really f***ing stupid.  You're listening to the worst of worst.  You're listening to the worst.  Not the best, the absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful. 
[00:00:30]  Let's not get confused here.  Dateline's doing this because it's a freak show and it gets the big ratings.  That's the only reason they're doing this.  They don't give a crap about Progeria Kids.  There's only five in the whole world.  You can't care about something that there's only five of?  I think there's more than that, Opie.  All right, maybe eight.  Maybe a couple more.  Here's the audio.  They don't live that long, right?  Here's the audio from the Dateline special.  But Seth Cook would say he's having too much fun to complain. 
[00:01:00]  He considers himself the luckiest kid in the world.  Ew!  Ripping off Lou Gehrig.  Does he really think he's the luckiest kid in the world?  Because he can get in the movies on a child's annual senior citizen discount all at the same time?  Is he really the luckiest kid in the world?  By the way, the intro to this piece, the little fella is riding a toy truck.  Of course he is.  He's riding a toy truck.  You know, before you consider yourself the luckiest kid or guy or woman in the world, 
[00:01:30]  can you really take a look at yourself and then everyone else and really think,  are you luckier than that guy there?  Are you the luckiest kid in the world when you look at dad's driver's license and you say,  what is that?  He goes, don't worry, you'll never need to know.  If being able to see your blood pump in your veins through your transparent skin,  if you always wanted to look like the hiney-headed aliens from Star Trek, 
[00:02:00]  then you truly are, from the Menagerie episode.  For the people that I don't know, precarious kids, they age really, really fast.  Yeah.  They got bodies like old men by the time they're five.  They're totally bald.  They got, like, weird little pointy features.  And they age.  And they, like, by 10 years old, I think they're 90.  And that's about it.  All right, back to the story. 
[00:02:30]  The luckiest kid in the world with great parents and the coolest dog around.  That will outlive you.  No matter what the obstacle, Seth seems to find a way to pick himself up and keep coming back for more.  This is your new mark.  Above all, this is a boy in a hurry.  I can never get moving.  There's no time to waste.  For Seth Cook, life is too precious.  Oh, I beat it. I beat it.  That's it. New record.  A non-stop joy rock that could end any time. 
[00:03:00]  Nice.  All right.  There they go.  That's terrific.  The happy music just ended.  Ended at any time.  Their lives go by so fast that God even gave them the fast voice.  Yeah.  You know?  Hey, how you doing?  Yep.  I'm on my helium diet.  What the hell?  And you didn't think God had a sense of humor.  They just stopped the happy music. 
[00:03:30]  Everything was fine.  Right.  Plays with his dog.  Luckiest boy in the world.  Nice music.  Right.  Let me...  That could end at any time.  They have to over-dramatize it.  I hate when people, like, take something in nature and make it look like it's because of one of God's physical actions.  Like, um, after something bad happens, it was raining.  That's because God was crying.  Yes.  Was he?  I don't think so.  All right.  Hold on.  I've got to get that piece again now. 
[00:04:00]  Did E-Rock steal my breakfast?  Oh, okay.  No.  Where's Ant Comlet?  All right.  Here's the ending again.  Made it a while ago.  Can I say the fruit I just had could be the best thing I've ever eaten, and I want more.  All right.  Well, strawberries.  Here's the end of that piece again with the music's, uh, dramatically ending.  You're passing.  What the freak is going on?  Hold on a minute.  As everyone eats. 
[00:04:30]  I want to eat.  Somebody get the boss.  I got my food over there, but I can't sit here and just chew.  Yes, you can't.  I can never get moving.  There's no time to waste.  For Seth Cook, life is too precious.  Oh, I beat it.  I beat it.  That's it.  The record.  A nonstop joyride that could end any time.  Oh!  All dramatic.  There you go.  Oh, I did it.  I did it.  Did you?  He said, I beat it. 
[00:05:00]  I thought it was, I did it.  Oh.  I beat it.  All right.  The next clip is...  He's racing a fast-forwarded clock.  Who wants to guess what the progeria kid hates?  Sunlight.  God.  The answer is very obvious.  What do you think the progeria kid hates? 
[00:05:30]  Wait, wait.  Oh, the guys.  He's obvious, huh?  Huh?  People that make fun of him?  When he gets stuck to flypaper and he has to yell, hey, don't curl me up and throw me out.  When people treat him special or different.  I bet he hates when people treat him different.  Right.  Like when they, like when they, uh, they, they single him out. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  And go, that's the boy.  We want to throw rocks at you.  Let's go to Jeremy in Jersey here.  Jeremy, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Jeremy.  That would have been fun if they, uh, put that screeching record, uh, sound effect after that intro.  Bye, midge me.  Bye, fella.  All right.  This is what the progeria kid hates.  All right.  11-year-old Seth Cook is a little boy with a big pencil and an even bigger problem. 
[00:06:30]  Math.  I know what he hates.  When his social security checks bounce.  The little fella hates math.  Can you blame him?  Of course he does.  Can you blame him?  What good is it for him, really?  No matter how you look at it, it's bad.  Multiplication, forget about it.  Addition, ugly, subtraction, well, kind of factual. 
[00:07:00]  Why would he want to count past ten?  Yeah.  Doesn't really need to know anything past ten, maybe eleven.  When you take what could have been and you subtract what is, you're left with sadness.  The only equation that really matters.  All this poor, poor little kid, old man, guy.  Uh, dead bent.  He's seen his golden years at age two.  I remember.  Let me tell you, you kids don't understand what it was like. 
[00:07:30]  Eleven-year-old Seth Cook is a little boy with a big pencil and an even bigger problem.  Math.  Like any school kid, Seth would rather be anywhere else.  But math class is where we found him first.  When he's, uh, when he's talking about the old days and when, when, when, when, uh, when Seth describes the big one, he's talking about a doody.  Uh, well, people are calling up with other things he may hate. 
[00:08:00]  Let's go to Scott in Jersey.  Scott.  Yeah, I think the little raisin hates when you press fast forward on the VCR.  Nothing.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, let's go to Anthony in Virginia.  Anthony!  Yeah, I thought you were going to say he's taking naps because that would be the equivalent of a three-year coma.  He hates naps. 
[00:08:30]  They are like comas.  Very good, Anthony.  All right.  Well, that's first.  Found him first.  How you doing?  Hey, how are you?  Good.  My name's Rob.  Nice to meet you.  I think we have something in common.  No, we don't.  I don't like math.  So this is 14.  Oh, I thought you were going to be dead in six months, too.  I am also laughed at by everyone.  Do you really not like math, Rob? 
[00:09:00]  You douche.  Yeah.  Hey, and they all got to get down low and, yeah.  Way to relate to the little fella.  Would you talk to a normal 11-year-old kid like that?  No.  He would talk like a normal person kind of conversation, would go on.  But he's got to get, hey, you know, I'm like you.  Really?  I hate math, too.  Ah, yeah.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Did he buy that toy truck when he went through his midlife crisis?  Oh, the audience is ruthless. 
[00:09:30]  Let's go to Jeff in Ohio.  Jeff, what's up?  I hate the fact that at age 10 he has to take Viagra.  Oh, wow.  All right.  That's so he can stand up straight.  All right, fella.  They both hate math.  Let's continue with the clip.  I don't like math.  Hey, Jeff.  So this would be 14?  With a disease that perversely turns years and numbers upside down,  maybe it's no coincidence that Seth and math have always been at odds. 
[00:10:00]  I saw your report card.  You're passing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you don't know the date on that report card, though.  Oh, things have changed since the last report card?  A little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit?  How about a lot?  I've gained 20 years.  Right.  In one semester.  Thanks, God.  How could you give the kid an F if you were a teacher?  I know, right?  I'd give them all A's.  Why would you even go to school?  Seriously.  Yeah, why would you?  Make them get left back? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  You've got to pass them.  No matter what.  Yeah.  We have to give them a real gym test.  Give them an F.  Yeah.  Come on to chin up.  Alarm cracks off.  Let's go to Elliot.  Elliot!  Hey, I heard he didn't do his math homework.  He got grounded in 30 years to life.  When he gets grounded, it's like 40 years to life, yes.  Well, more people trying to figure out what he hates. 
[00:11:00]  Yes, Max in Dallas.  Yeah, I think he hates Alvin and the Chipmunks because it sounds like they're making fun out of him.  Punch it out.  Bye, Max.  I just want to live a year.  And, yes, he stinks at math because of his Alzheimer's.  Those numbers.  I just did that problem.  No, you didn't.  What do you want for Christmas? 
[00:11:30]  A big wheel slash little rascal.  I can't do the voice.  So I just got to talk like that.  Well, you just got to kind of make it sound a little higher.  He's actually really...  And he's much too high.  Yeah, he's way up there.  Wait, is that good?  No, I can't sound like him.  Hey, Matt's not bad.  I can't do impersonations.  We need helium.  Let's say hi to Matt Maker from a website we can't pronounce.  I hope this school...  I hope his school has a good 401k plan for his retirement.  Talking about the Pajaria kid.  And Mike could be the best one of the day. 
[00:12:00]  Did he go for his first and last haircut at the same time?  Oh, little fella.  Want to get back to the audio here?  As long as we don't make fun of it.  All right.  It's the Pajaria kid on Dateline.  And for the people out there that can't believe we're making fun of this, go screw.  Take a long walk off a short pier.  Pardon my French.  This is how you should do this story.  Not like Dateline and make believe you care about the little fella.  You don't care.  You're doing it for ratings because it's a freak show. 
[00:12:30]  It's a freak show and it's on our TVs.  You can't.  Saturated fat by Seth Cook.  On this school day, Seth is offering his 6th grade classmates a living lesson in nutrition.  Saturated fat plays a big role in my life.  My body is getting older faster than most people.  But amazingly, what others see as a burden, Seth sees as a blessing.  I'm one of 40 kids in the whole wide world that has Pajaria.  So it's really neat.  Oops.  Is it?  Oh, God.  The poor kid thinks it's neat. 
[00:13:00]  Is it really a blessing in disguise?  And during that sound clip, it went from 40 to 28.  Because their lives are, yeah.  Blessing in disguise.  An old man's disguise.  He's even using old person expressions.  Hey, good luck, Seth.  Ah, from your lips to God's ears.  Come on.  Penny saved.  They should at least bring back some of those names where you retired.  Like Gertrude and, you know. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, what are some of the guys' names from way back when?  I don't think there's a, I don't think there's a Caitlyn that has Pajaria.  No, Amber's.  Right.  Oh, no.  It's a Pajaria kid.  Gertie.  Call him Mort.  Call him Gertrude.  Mort.  Morty.  Let's go to Dennis in Jersey.  Dennis.  Yo, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I think he doesn't like playing Half-Life either.  The game Half-Life. 
[00:14:00]  That's terrible.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Let's go to Jason in Indiana.  Jason.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Jason.  Hey, Jason.  Welcome aboard.  I bet you the Pajaria kid hates knowing he's going to go straight from Pampers to Depends.  It's not a blessing in disguise.  Not at all.  He sees it as special because there's only so many kids.  How many?  40?  Yeah.  40.  What are the odds, man?  Wow.  Let's say hi to Doug in Minnesota. 
[00:14:30]  Doug.  Hey.  Hey.  I think at the same time he's going into puberty, they're going to be calling him a 30-year-old man.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we go to the next clip here?  Pajaria kid on Dateline.  He gets both freckles and liver spots.  Let's handle this with dignity.  Yes.  Let's try.  Please.  He talks about the people that stare.  Seth says he often attracts gawking from adults.  This lady was staring at me and she didn't even see the sign in front of me. 
[00:15:00]  She just ran right into it.  She kept walking?  Yep.  And went boom?  Yep.  Ew.  Like right out of a cartoon?  Pretty much.  Oh.  Yeah.  How about kazoo in the Bugs Bunny cartoon?  Stupid.  That was the Flintstones.  Whatever it was.  He's a great kazoo.  Exactly.  The Flintstones stink.  Well, dum-dum.  Who's the one that was on the plane with Bugs Bunny?  With the alien?  The gremlin.  The gremlin.  Yeah.  Whatever it is.  Whatever has a big head and was drawn.  That's what this kid is.  Did the lady really walk into the sign? 
[00:15:30]  I don't know why she stares.  Because you're one of 40 on the planet.  She should stare.  People look at a Maserati when it goes by.  Yeah.  That's true.  There's only so many.  You're not used to seeing them.  Plus, she wasn't looking at you.  She was reading the sign through your transparent skull.  That was unnecessary.  Why did I say that?  But it's true.  Of course we're going to stare.  Maybe not stare.  We're supposed to stare. 
[00:16:00]  Those people out there that think they're better than everyone else because they don't stare.  Shut up.  People don't get it or don't want to get it.  We're very curious beings.  And we like, like, we got to look.  That's why we rubberneck at accidents and things like that.  And that's why when this kid walks by, people are going to stare.  And scream.  Walking signs.  You see pregnant mothers just instinctively covering their bellies.  Oh, please, God.  Is that catching?  Oh, please, God.  He's 90.  Please, God. 
[00:16:30]  Please, God.  I wore my lead maternity top today.  Please, God.  Please, God.  Please, God.  Out of a cartoon.  Pretty much.  What did you do?  I laughed.  I tried to wait until she got down the other aisle of the store, though.  You didn't want to laugh in front of her?  Uh-uh.  And why is that?  Because I didn't want to hurt her feelings.  Oh.  But she was kind of staring and being impolite toward you.  So why would you care?  Just two wrongs don't make a right. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  This kid has the wisdom of a night.  Oh.  Oh.  No wonder.  I think he's been coached.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  How about a fist to the chin?  I'd be a grumpy old preschooler.  I'd be just yelling and screaming at everybody.  He knows two wrongs don't make a right.  A wrong chromosome and a wrong chromosome make a wrong child.  Let's go to Jeff in Idaho.  Speaking of staring.  Yes, Jeff.  I was just going to say, next time Seth sees a person staring at him, he should just say, 
[00:17:30]  hey, take a picture.  It'll last longer than I will.  Oh, fuck.  All right, I'm punching out.  Let's go to Matt.  You know around his house, all they have is Polaroids?  Because there's no time to go to Photomat.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Matt in Port Clinton.  Matt.  Oh, look.  Hey, Anthony's line about kid mayfly didn't get a big enough laugh.  That's okay.  Not many people know that the mayfly only lives for a day. 
[00:18:00]  Does it really?  Yeah.  Touch it out.  That's a bit sad.  I had a pet mayfly once.  They have a nice, they had a pet mayfly.  It's an awful pet to have, especially if you get attached.  Here we go.  More of the Progeria kid from Dateline.  All our time together was spent me looking at it in the corner on the ceiling, trying to  coax it down.  And then it died.  I ate it.  Here we go.  But I had sex with it. 
[00:18:30]  Still, Seth doesn't seem to dwell on what he can't have.  He focuses on what he can do.  And he's about as well-adjusted a pre-teen as you could find, who's best friends with  his ubiquitous dog, a rat terrier named Bullet.  Oh, I jumped right into that.  And crazy for Xbox games.  How many hours have you logged with Xbox?  I don't know.  I'm happy, though.  You have to put it like that.  I know, really.  Can't you just put, how much fun is the Xbox? 
[00:19:00]  Why don't you just do a little percentage question?  Stupid ass.  Sometimes you heard how many hours.  Oh, no.  Likes the Xbox because it beats the next box.  Henchman from Brooklyn writes, hey, we have to stare.  It's not often you get to see the real-life Gollum.  Oh, my God. 
[00:19:30]  That's terrible.  Why do we do this?  Because Dateline is trying to make it sound like, you know, this is a good thing they're  doing.  Well, this Dateline guy is a disingenuous douche.  He really is trying too hard.  What did you do?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I walked by a mirror and wept openly.  What do you think I did?  Stupid.  Why did you wait until she was down the aisle?  Do you want to hurt her feelings?  I didn't want to.  But isn't she?  Shut up.  Exactly.  Shut your mouth.  It is all very self-serving. 
[00:20:00]  Of course it is.  At least here, you know.  You know what you're getting.  Exactly.  Garbage.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, the Xbox clip.  We're halfway through it.  Xbox games.  How many hours have you logged with Xbox?  I don't know.  I'm happy, though, because Xbox doesn't tell you how long you've been playing.  You don't want to know?  I don't want to know.  Even with stubbed fingers, a common characteristic of progeria, Seth has become adept at the controls, 
[00:20:30]  an activity at which he can compete on an equal footing.  Ew.  Stubbed fingers.  Owned.  Come on.  I'll play him.  I'll own him.  Noob.  He's the oldest noob.  Let's say hi to Rachel in Massachusetts.  Rachel.  Hi.  Hi, Rachel.  I just wanted to know if he dressed up for Halloween as a little kid.  Oh, my God. 
[00:21:00]  But he is a little kid inside.  Let's go to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Hey, this kid was doing pretty good until he fell off the jungle gym and broke his hip.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  What's up, guys?  Hey, you know what?  Once you have a child with disability, I wish all you guys freaking cancer.  All three of you.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Boy.  Cancer, you should only get cancer.  He tricked us, too.  He said that one of his arms is 10 inches longer than the other and staring is part of human nature. 
[00:21:30]  Well, what if somebody's arm is longer?  You're offending them with your little joking.  I'm sure he didn't mind us making jokes about anything else, but because it's that.  Well, when it hits too close to home, that's when you have a problem with a radio show like this.  Shut up.  Let's say hi to him.  You're one of the 40.  You've got to be pissed, man.  Yeah, of course.  Believe me.  Let's go to Randy on Long Island.  Randy.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  I was just wondering if he loved the dogs so much because their lives are measured on the same scale.  That was just cruel. 
[00:22:00]  That was just mad.  Let's go to John in Queens.  John.  Yo, what's going on?  I'm back back.  Hey, John.  I'm wondering when this guy reaches the age of the prom.  Is he going to let Elmer Fudd in the end?  Watch out, boys.  He looks like Elmer Fudd at prom.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe he'd been the joke there.  Let's go to John in Arkansas.  John.  Oh, yeah.  The little kid hates when he goes into the grocery store, sees expiration dates, and just wishes he could last that long.  He's standing there, and the clerk actually looks at him and stamps a date on him. 
[00:22:30]  How you doing?  How you doing?  All right.  Let's go back to more audio.  What a buzz kill that guy was.  No kidding, man.  What a douche.  Turn something else on.  You know what kind of show this is.  Yeah, relax.  Yeah.  We finally found something we could all goof on.  Sorry.  We don't pretend to be what we're not.  That Dateline thing you try to watch and get a little tear when all they're doing is mocking this kid.  It's exploitation.  They're not laughing at him.  They're exploiting him.  Stupid.  These shows are exploitation. 
[00:23:00]  Of course they are.  Michael from Chicago.  He's not a preteen.  He's a neverteen.  Oh, my God.  If they really did care, they should be doing a story on him every week.  Every week.  Exactly.  They got what they wanted out of the little fella, and they're moving on to the next disaster.  Moving on to the next Predator show.  Right.  Here we go.  Pajaria Kid on Dateline.  On this day, only the aptly named Bullet can keep up with Seth, chasing a tennis ball and then going bananas over the bubbles. 
[00:23:30]  Now keep a close eye on Bullet as he crash lands.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  That's.  And watch and listen to the biggest belly laugh from the littlest boy.  Did you hear that thug?  I think Bullet needs a stunt dog.  Ew.  Aw.  Do you really think Bullet needs a stunt dog?  It's adorable.  I don't mind the kid.  I hate the reporter.  Yeah.  I don't like Bullet either. 
[00:24:00]  Bullet sucks.  What a bad dog.  Awful dog.  You know what Bullet needs?  A Michelin right through him.  That'll straighten Bullet out.  Get out of here before I throw you out.  How do you think this piece ends?  You know how these pieces end.  It's all fun and games, right?  Yeah.  You got a little tragedy? 
[00:24:30]  A little reality?  Honestly, I don't know.  I don't know if there's an actual tragedy at the end, but you know they got to get very serious at the end.  I'm thinking he addresses how tragic it is and addresses the fact that the kid will, you know, pass on a little earlier than they thought.  Yet, they will focus more on the fact that he is living every moment, Jopi.  Living every moment.  All right.  Right.  Jimmy, you want to guess how this story ends?  I think that the reporter will, the kid will be saying something like, 
[00:25:00]  I'm really looking forward to it.  And the reporter will go, why?  Why?  The reporter's, I think, going to hit this kid with some cold, hard, ugly facts.  Or maybe a game of hide-and-seek, where a little Progeria kid closes his eyes and can see everywhere everyone's hiding through his lids.  Oh, my God.  Smitty in Boston.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Great.  I'd love to buy this kid the PlayStation 3, but I don't think it comes out until December.  Oh, my God.  I wonder if they put hide-and-seek, the reporter's too cruel, he'll probably hide in a place the kid will never find him, like a high school. 
[00:25:30]  Caesar in New York.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, how bad do you think this kid was hoping to be a premature baby so he could enjoy life a little longer?  Oh, my God.  Really ugly.  It really is now just stepping up to ugliness.  We pick tough targets, don't we?  Well, this is how it ends.  Here it is.  Yeah, boy, aren't we real men. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, we don't touch the gangbangers.  We touch the Progeria kid.  Exactly.  The gangbangers, we give a brief mention.  We get the Progeria kid, three breaks.  We'll kick his ass if he comes in here.  Yeah, we'll talk about the gangbangers and hope they weren't listening.  All right, here we go.  Real men.  This is how it ends.  The Progeria kid on Dateline.  If people watching this worry about you, what do you want them to know?  Um, I'm doing fine. 
[00:26:30]  And to hear Seth, the boy in a hurry, tell it, he'll be fine forever.  I can't wait to get to heaven.  I can't wait.  I can't wait.  Heaven is a subject most sixth graders never think about, but Seth brought it up himself.  Patty says Seth doesn't fear death, and he's anxious to see his late grandfather in heaven.  I remember about seven or eight, we told him that he probably would go see Jesus before we did.  And he thought that was thoroughly okay. 
[00:27:00]  What do you think heaven's like?  I'm going to go fishing with the Lord, fishing for Swedish fish, and hunting gummy bears and chocolate rabbits.  Heaven stinks.  I guarantee you can catch at least ten fish a day.  And you don't have to throw them back.  And you don't have to throw them back.  Sounds like a nice place.  What's going to be?  Unless you're a fish.  Yeah, right?  Poor fish.  Where does he get to go?  Fish lives a good life.  And he winds up with his creator sticking a hook in his mouth, showing it to some freakish boy. 
[00:27:30]  No throwbacks.  He's going to go find the Lord.  Oh, I'd be finding the Lord, too.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  That's like a complaint box around here.  Yeah, no kidding.  Why this heaven thing just quite doesn't wash?  That kid's heaven sounds great for him.  I'd be walking around going, another night of gummy bears?  Can I have an omelet like we got from the Brooklyn Diner, please?  God always had a miserable end to the story. 
[00:28:00]  Horrid.  Depressing.  Hampton?  I can't wait.  Good.  That was awful.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Oh, by the way, his grandfather is 18.  I can't wait.  Thank you, Kevin from Connecticut.  Hello.  It's Kelly from the Bad News Bears.  Oof.  Thanks, Kev. 
[00:28:30]  Let's go to Rick in California.  Rick?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Rick.  Oh, that was a great line, man.  I wonder if he slows his voice down just to sound like what he would sound like if he  was a regular kid.  Hey, can we do that?  Yeah, get his voice, slow it down, and see what he would sound like.  Like, pitch it down, you know.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  And see what he would sound like, like a regular kid.  Yeah, definitely.  God damn, finally, I get a line in that I can punch out with.  All right.  Thank you, Rick.  Bye-bye.  It was a true gem.  Let's go to Elliot in Ohio. 
[00:29:00]  Elliot.  Hey, how does this work?  If he was born on February 29th of the leap year, that means he'd be like 80 on his first  birthday?  Punch it out.  That would just be cruel.  That's a poor bastard.  All right.  We'll take a break.  Maybe we'll continue with this.  Maybe we won't.  We shouldn't.  I think that tank is about dry.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  I know what you want. 
[00:29:30]  Bip, bip, bip.  Look at that boom.  My God.  They're giant.  That turn you on.  We'll be about Wednesday.  This is Nicky Six.  You're listening to the worst.  I mean, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You know what that is?  It's our Scott Muni impression.  Scott, so.  My bad Scott Muni impression.  You're a good Scott Muni impression.  The beloved Scott, so who is gone now, but not forgotten.  We have audio tape of him broadcasting during the big blackout of 1977. 
[00:30:00]  Which obviously was 30 years ago.  And for the people that don't know Scott Muni, a legendary rock jock here in New York City.  And during the blackout, Scott Muni decided, I need to still broadcast.  That's when they really gave a crap.  Yeah.  We'd be like, oh, my lights flickered.  I'll be in tomorrow.  Supposedly, rumor has it, or legend has it, he went to the actual transmitter with records and played them.  Yeah.  I kind of don't understand because most people couldn't hear his broadcast because the electricity was out. 
[00:30:30]  I guess he was broadcasting to people with those transistor radios back in the day.  Yeah.  Giving updates and playing tunes.  Oh, and directing traffic, saving children, putting out fires, stopping looters.  Scotso was a superhero.  I really like this one.  Check it out on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I resemble that remark.  That's the OK Terrific guy, Anthony.  OK Terrific.  OK Terrific.  OK Terrific.  OK Terrific.  OK Terrific. 
[00:31:00]  OK Terrific.  OK Terrific.  OK Terrific.  That's right.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  Virgin.  I guess Scott Muni commented about us playing his voice on our show.  Virgin.  Today?  Yeah.  He said bitch on his show today.  On his little show.  That said something like if another radio show wants to use that, he can.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Or he can or whatever.  Feel fish.  Feel free, bitch.  Unfortunately, Scott, so we can't record you on another station and use you here.  Nah, we get in trouble.  So we have to paw through years of tape, try to find more cuts of Scott's up.  Where's Psycho Mark?  Because they found a tape of Scott Muni.  Remember the big blackout of 77?  19 or 18?  The blackout of 1877.  The blackout of 77.  Remember the city was in just complete turmoil? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  I was just a little taut.  I guess they found like audio of Scott Muni like broadcasting from the Empire State Building?  Scott's.  Is that true?  Yes.  What was the tape saying?  I don't know.  Timmy found it.  We, uh, it was in the archives.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh...  It was in the archives.  Yeah.  And, uh, remember the big blackout of 1977? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  You wouldn't remember that because you were living somewhere else.  Well, I heard about it.  Mm-hmm.  Anyhow, uh, they had to, uh, naturally the whole city was shut down.  I guess they had some backup.  The whole city was shut down.  There was looting and...  Rioting.  Rioting and raping going on.  And that was before Giuliani had everybody corralled in.  He'd have, he'd have the cops out on the street like in two seconds with, uh, automatic weapons.  That was an opportunity is what that was.  Shopping spree.  They call that the shopping spree of 77.  Yes. 
[00:33:00]  God damn.  But the funny thing is, I mean, this place...  I need a TV.  Give me a brick.  There we go.  Oh, look at that.  That's a nice thing in Macy's window.  I'll grab that.  This place had its priorities all mixed up, though, because people are looting and raping and shopping.  I have to get on the air.  So he went to the transmitter on the top of the Empire State Building.  Is that the truth?  And wanted to tell everyone that the rock and roll will continue playing on any W.  I'm just amazed.  Wait a minute.  If it was a blackout, the elevators didn't work. 
[00:33:30]  You're telling me Scottson walked up 86 flights of stairs?  I don't know how, but they got him up there.  Come on.  They had King Kong carry him up to the treadmill.  He's broadcasting from this room.  It just sounds like this big, giant hall.  Really?  And he's going, this is Scottson here.  And I wanted to remind everybody out there that we are still playing music.  Ah, yeah.  You still get the best rock and roll.  Even when society as we know it is crumbling outside. 
[00:34:00]  Below me.  Even anarchy needs a soundtrack.  Oh, my God. 
[00:34:30]  Here we are.  Yeah, it's a total anarchy outside.  But we're here bringing you the best in rock and roll.  Scott Muni, the soundtrack of disaster.  Outside.  We're going to try to get to some Pink Floyd.  Bullets just riddling my studio here.  Two for Tuesday must go on. 
[00:35:00]  Two for Tuesday must go on.  Yeah, go find that.  Here it is.  The Beatles.  The Beatles.  British Biscuits. 
[00:35:30]  British Biscuits.  Bringing you British Biscuits.  Whoa, that was a low one.  Blackout down on the streets.  I mean that in more ways than one.  A little racial joke by Scottson.  Complete chaos, but we had our rock and roll back in 1977. 
[00:36:00]  Lights are off from the top of the Scott Muni building.  Oh, man, is that funny.  He didn't care.  I got to get to the Empire State Building.  People need their rock and roll.  It's two for Tuesday.  The Beatles.  Revolution. 
[00:36:30]  M.E.W.  I remember when John Lennon came into this very studio and, whoa, that one came through  the window.  Excuse me while I return fire.  No one's taking Scottson out. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, it's going to be all right if you listen to Scottson.  Let me just pick a few off from high atop the Empire State Building.  Let me get my high-powered rifle.  Look at that one with the TV.  There he goes.  Playing your best rock and roll music from the Beatles and picking off looners from high 
[00:37:30]  atop the Empire State Building.  Hey.  Where rock lives and looters die.  But if you want money for people, you'll find that.  Hold on.  I think we actually found the...  This is the real thing.  Oh, it is?  You got the real thing, really?  On the O.P. and Anthony show.  So this is actual tape of Mr. Muni broadcasting live from the top of the Empire State Building 
[00:38:00]  during the blackout, right?  This is it.  Okay.  1977.  77.  Let's take it back a few years.  It's coming.  It's coming?  All right.  Here we go.  Here it comes.  Here it is.  Whoa.  That's Cat Stevens.  And we're at our transmitter site.  Scott Muni here at WNAW-FM in New York.  And if you are just with us, you already know what's been going on for these low, these many  hours.  You know...  We're back on the air, which is kind of nice, although many parts of the city do not 
[00:38:30]  have power at the moment.  We are in a room that is one we're unaccustomed to, equipment we're unaccustomed to and all.  But we will be doing music and we will be giving you information.  At this moment, there is the possibility that up until midnight, many parts of the city  will not be back to normal.  There's a possibility we may not be with you either, because if they lose power again, we 
[00:39:00]  will disappear.  I have a small microphone here and a small turntable and just a little setup where we  are able to talk to you and tell you we are back on the air after many hours of absence.  It's not due to anything else other than another historical event for New York City that will  be written about and talked about and motion pictures made about albums and no doubt there 
[00:39:30]  will be a song.  Someone right now is writing the song or already has written it about 12 years after the first  one here in 1977, the blackout of 77, which of course broke all the records of the previous  blackout.  And it is warm and we have music for you.  We are WNEWFM in New York.  If you would like, I think it might be a nice idea to tell some of your friends, since we  are sort of a family, if you will talk to your friends, give them a call since telephones 
[00:40:00]  are working and say, NEWFM's back on the air.  And we do intend to give you all sorts of news, what is going on, what's going on now is a  lot of people are talking about what happened or why it happened and why, you know, things  didn't work out the way.  What the hell is that?  At any rate, we will have music for you and we'll do some more.  Hello, Sarah.  Connect me to Bigberry.  A telephone ring. 
[00:40:30]  Wow, that's a classic.  Yeah, we're back on the air, 77.  And we might lose power.  You say we got a revolution.  Fire trucks are rolling past this backup studio here.  Carnage in the streets.  Look like a butcher truck overturned.  But we're playing the Beatles because we have to do what we have to do. 
[00:41:00]  Hey, hey, hey, drop that amplifier, son.  I have to transmit here.  Don't be trying to steal Scotso's equipment.  I'll bust a cap in your ass.  And that saying's not going to be hip for another 10 years.  It's going to be all right. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Wow, look at that.  A little piece of history.  There's more priceless stuff on there.  Probably, eh, I'm lit.  Scotch Munich.  New York is black, but I'm lit.  I think like a Magnum of Champagne that day or something.  Oh, that's the rumor, yeah, that they were drinking champagne.  Magnum of Champagne in one hand and a Magnum Pistol in the other.  I'm ready for the blackout.  Hey, I can't see Earl.  There's no lights on.  Earl, could you smile so I can see you? 
[00:42:00]  Where's Earl?  We must say, though, Scott Muni was very, very cool to us.  He was the only cool guy here.  One of the pretty much on the air anyway.  One of the few that were cool to us in the beginning.  Scott so.  So this is a loving tribute to the man.  Virgin.  John, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Listen, you think Scott was up there between songs trying to **** people? 
[00:42:30]  From the top of the Empire State Building, I'm going to **** people.  All right, what we got, Rick?  All right.  Oh, my God.  I'm not letting you in.  Two for Tuesday.  The big blackout. 
[00:43:00]  And she ain't getting in.  Oh, my God.  That was fun.  That was a good time.  Guess how many boobs I done today.  Whip them out Wednesday.  They've got these stickers all over New York, and it's called Whip them out Wednesdays.  You drive around.  Yeah.  The lovely ladies see it.  They pull up next to you and maybe give it a little lift.  Hey, this is Brian Regan, and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:43:30]  Hey, I love Metallica.  Jimmy, you love Metallica.  Anthony loves Metallica.  I even like the fact that people that don't like them said they sold out with the Black Album.  How?  Yeah, I know.  Well, there's those people.  Who says that?  There's people.  People are saying.  I love old Metallica, but the Black Album, one of the greatest albums ever made. 
[00:44:00]  Agreed.  Now there's the hardcore fans.  You don't even know Metallica.  That's what they started showing up.  You don't know nothing about music.  You don't know.  Nothing else matters is great.  Their music of late, I'm not really there.  Wherever I may roam.  I'm not digging their music of late.  But that stuff, great.  The earlier stuff, fantastic.  Just a great band with longevity, great story, great personality.  Battery.  What's better than Battery off Master of Puppets? 
[00:44:30]  Come on.  I guess.  I don't think anything.  Master of Puppets is a great album, too.  Yes, absolutely.  But I may have to just hang up my fanboy card for Metallica.  Yeah, Jimmy hasn't heard this yet.  Dan was playing something in the office.  I swear to you, I thought it was one of our silly listeners trying to be funny, trying  to come up with something for the radio show.  Danny found this?  Oh, it was Danny.  Derek found it?  Derek found it.  Sorry, Paris the thought.  I give somebody else credit. 
[00:45:00]  Why am I looking at this waif in the glass?  Derek found it.  Well, I really, and when Than was playing it in the office, I was like, get that on a  CD so we could goof on it.  Like, this is so bad from one of our listeners.  We got to have fun with this.  It turns out what you're about to hear is really Metallica.  From when, though?  Like, what is it?  This is brand new.  Oh, no.  It's ringtones.  It's on their website, and you can buy them for $3 each.  Metallica ringtones.  Do they really need the money at this point? 
[00:45:30]  And do they really need to do them in this fashion?  Right.  Someone has to, like, tell them that these stink.  But I think you get so famous that you get the people around you that are too scared  to tell you that something is awful.  I really believe that.  Do you think?  Because I think their friends, at least, could say, you know, dude, do you think this ringtone  thing is good?  No.  No.  It's a problem.  No one just says, shut up.  Yeah.  No.  Everyone is too scared because they like their part of the organization.  You don't want to be kicked out of the inner circle. 
[00:46:00]  Right.  Nobody teases you when you're there anymore.  So here's some Metallica ringtones.  Listen to this.  Whose phone is that?  Oh, it's yours.  This is James from Metallica.  Pick it up.  See, that one's just basic voice.  Yeah.  You know, so it's not that bad.  You're saying, why are you making such a big deal, guys?  That's just him saying something.  It's not that big a deal.  Hey, this is James from Metallica.  I'm stuck in your pocket. 
[00:46:30]  It stinks in here.  Answer the phone.  All right.  More just talking.  That's a little comedic.  And he's trying to be funny and failing miserably.  But he's not a comedian.  It's just a little voiceover thing.  But that's the European ring.  This is James from Metallica.  Pick up.  I don't like the fact that he's saying James from Metallica.  He should say it's James Hetfield. 
[00:47:00]  No.  Because any Metallica...  No, you should just...  No, because if you're buying these ringtones, you know it's a Metallica ringtone.  You're already a fan, so you don't need to be reminded it's James from Metallica.  Well, it's for...  That's the first mistake they're making.  It's for other people who are listening who wouldn't know who that was.  It's not for you.  Yeah, but you would tell people.  Like, I had Ben snore as my ring for the longest time.  Yeah.  And it starts snoring, and that means I got a phone call coming in.  And people would go, what the hell is that?  And then I would be able to tell them what it is.  What else is there? 
[00:47:30]  Well, this is where it gets really bad.  For whom the phone rings, pick it up!  James from Metallica says, pick up the phone!  Yeah.  For whom the phone rings.  Now, I...  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It doesn't end there, Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton.  Who told them this was good? 
[00:48:00]  I'm just having fast-forward nightmares.  Yeah.  I'm picking up the phone on a crazy ring.  No.  How much money can you make off of it?  Uh, hello, this is Ozzy on the phone.  Right.  God, no.  Here's the next one.  It gets worse.  Sad but true.  Your mom's on the phone.  James from Metallica says, pick up the phone! 
[00:48:30]  Sad but true.  Uh.  Your mom's on the phone?  Uh.  Uh-oh.  See, because we're all supposed to hate our parents.  Yeah.  Uh.  Uh.  Yeah.  The only one of those I'll accept is if your friend has been hit by a car and whatever he  calls you, motor breath plays.  See?  Because that ties in cleverly.  Of course.  Give me those elbows.  There you go.  Wow.  Give me those elbows.  Give me those elbows so I can smack myself in the thin lips. 
[00:49:00]  He gets really creative with this next one.  Yeah.  Master!  Master!  Your wife's calling.  Pick up the phone.  See?  Because she's...  She's the master.  Master.  I want to punch Metallica in the face.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is it.  It's over.  What happened?  You thought...  What happened?  You thought the Napster thing was bad. 
[00:49:30]  You thought they were selling out with some of the albums they were putting out.  And it's kind of...  But this right here is it.  This is where even I must agree.  It's over, Johnny.  I liked the Napster.  I didn't blame them for not wanting to be ripped off.  Oh, shut up.  No, I mean it.  I liked that fact.  They had to do it.  Not you, Jimmy.  I was just saying shut up to Metallica.  But this...  Large...  You don't have to do this.  Does Large do any?  Does anybody else do any?  Of course.  Of course, Large does it.  Mostly James, though.  Mostly James, but... 
[00:50:00]  Ready for the last one from James?  Oh, yeah.  Wherever is your phone?  This is James from Metallica.  Pick up.  That's the one I heard.  And I was like, it has to be one of our listeners just goofing on ringtones.  Wherever is your phone?  It doesn't even make sense.  Yeah, how about pick up because you're on Rome?  Why not?  Why not? 
[00:50:30]  I really thought that was a listener.  Why not?  I was goofing on ringtones.  I'm like, we have to play this.  It's horrible.  But it's actually them doing ringtones.  People...  The government should monitor you, and if you spend $3 for one of them, they should just  send electricity into you and kill you through the phone somehow.  Here's one more from Kirk.  That's right.  Seek and destroy your phone.  It doesn't even make sense. 
[00:51:00]  Why not?  That one doesn't even make sense.  Why not?  Why would you destroy your phone?  That's because it's ringing.  Seek and destroy your phone.  Your phone.  Well, it ties in because, like, Seek and Destroy is the song, but the phone thing has to tie in.  Yeah.  So it's Seek and Destroy...  So it's Seek and Destroy your phone.  Yeah.  With the four horsemen ride and answer your phone.  Makes sense.  Master of puppets is pulling your string and answering the phone. 
[00:51:30]  Answering the phone.  Put that anywhere.  Works.  Let's say hi to Rob.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  James Hetfield.  The new Gene Simmons.  Well...  Ah.  Could be.  I don't know.  They're just trying to capitalize?  There's better ways to do it, though.  That is hacky and just awful.  Just put the guitar riffs.  Like, I wouldn't mind hearing that guitar riff that Kirk just did.  Yeah.  Fine.  Answer.  Yeah.  That's all you need.  Beth, I hear you calling. 
[00:52:00]  Will you please pick up the phone?  They could do that kiss.  They'll get together and put out their own ringtones.  I'm sure they have ringtones out there somewhere.  You think?  Gene gets all the money.  It's all about ringtones.  It doesn't matter who does it.  Gene gets the money.  I had some ringtones that I suggested.  They weren't cute, though.  No?  Yeah.  Like?  Kara from MySpace is actually using one.  Remember we did a bunch of ringtones out there at XM?  Oh, that's true.  We did them as a coup.  They were really bad.  Dingy, dingy, dingy.  Pick up the phone, see? 
[00:52:30]  Obnoxious.  Let's say hi to Kramer in Pittsburgh.  Blown up in Pittsburgh.  What's up, Kramer?  Not much, guys.  I got six Metallica tattoos, but as soon as I get home, I'm going to get a cheese grater.  They're coming off.  Yeah, not happy about the ringtones out.  Six Metallica tats, boy.  Dude, I'm sick.  My son is James Hetfield's pick on his crib.  I'm tearing that off when I get home, too.  All right, bro.  They just don't have to do that.  Dave and Yonkers, what's up?  What is this, the kinder, gentler James Hetfield? 
[00:53:00]  If I could get James Hetfield from Kill'em All to, like, go in a time machine?  You don't think present-day James Hetfield would enjoy hanging out with the old James Hetfield?  The old James Hetfield would beat him up.  Nah, that would be a problem.  There would be a fight that pops out of a time machine and just pummels the new James Hetfield.  I think new James Hetfield would smash the old one because the old one was all bearded up.  He did a drinker.  He was all skinny.  New James is like a strapping biker-type build.  I don't know.  I think old James, though, because he's a little juiced up and so angry at the new James, 
[00:53:30]  would probably throw a pretty good scrap at him.  Maybe.  Yeah.  And he's younger.  He's sober and would have all that rage that now can't be covered with alcohol and it's  coming out through fist-a-cups.  And he'd hear that ringtone and just the anger in the old James.  That's true.  The anger might do it over the ringtone.  Although, if it's Terminator rules, he'd be naked and that would be a little awkward  because you've got to come through naked.  I don't know.  I'm going to really have to give this some thought. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, we're going to have to figure that out.  Bob in Jersey.  What's up, Bob?  Yo, man.  What's up, guys?  I'm a huge fan.  What's going on?  What's up?  I can't even believe what I just heard.  Yeah, we couldn't either.  Literally couldn't believe that it was Metallica, but it's on their site.  And like Oak said, thought it was a goofy fan.  A fan just trying to be funny at our attention.  No.  It's James.  It's really Metallica trying to do ringtones.  And I'm with Jimmy.  I mean, if you just got a nice guitar riff from one of those guys.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  That'd be cool.  That's all you need. 
[00:54:30]  Just guitar riffs.  Yeah, I wouldn't mind hearing a bit of this.  Can people use music for their phone?  That's fine.  You're a fan.  You know who it is.  You don't need James to even say anything.  Just, you know, let's hear some guitar.  I like when I hear someone's phone ring with a cool, you know, guitar riff.  I, by the way, can't stand it.  You can't stand a ringtone?  I don't, I like the fact that new phones come out with a new ring.  Some brr, brr, something like that.  I don't like the retro ring.  Who's got that one?  Everybody.  I think I do.  Stop it with the goddamn one that sounds like the oldie time phone. 
[00:55:00]  Brr, brr, brr.  They changed that for a reason.  Know what's great about that?  It is the most annoying sound.  Everyone that has that as a ringtone, they think they're the only ones, and they think  they're the only ones that was clever enough to come up with the old school.  Look, it sounds like an old type phone.  First of all.  Is that a cell phone or an old bell phone?  Whoa.  But everyone thought they were clever.  Yeah.  By getting that one.  You're not alone.  That's probably one of the hottest ringtones out there. 
[00:55:30]  The old school phone ring.  I wound up keeping the one that my phone came with.  I could care less what the hell it sounds like.  Mine doesn't have many options.  I just put that one because it was just an option.  Was that it?  Yeah.  I got the hybrid.  I'm not a queer who thought it was cool.  Download it.  I got Steve's hybrid car as a text message.  Yeah, that's fun.  How do you do that?  I don't know how to do that.  Just give your phone to Danny.  No.  Actually, he was going to give me some new ringtones yesterday.  Was he?  Yeah, just stuff that has something to do with the show.  Like, I want secret agent man on mine. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  That means you got a message or something?  A text comes in.  A text?  Yeah.  Do you know what I want to hear?  See, mine's the same for text and phone.  I don't know.  When my phone is ringing, I want to hear, how did your parents die?  Why not?  How did your parents die?  Why not?  How did your parents die?  Why not?  How did your parents die?  Why not?  Listen to that acting.  You can barely distinguish any difference.  How did your parents die?  Why not?  He should have been in The Departed.  He actually sounds more upset at why not.  Why not? 
[00:56:30]  There's more emotion there.  How did your parents die?  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  You can hear his nose crinkling.  Why not?  Why not?  Hey, I'm looking at a picture of a midget with flipper hands.  This is going up on our website.  Wow.  What's up there, E-Rock?  OpianAnthony.com.  A midget sighting right outside, what, XM?  Was he born the day Hitler died?  Because it had to be reincarnation.  You got to see this picture.  E-Rock.  Midget with flipper hands.  E-Rock's midget sighting outside of XM Studios yesterday.  It's up on OpianAnthony.com. 
[00:57:00]  Oh.  Getting into a little cab?  The little fella needs help with the door.  Of course he does.  What does he do with toilet paper?  Where did I take you, pal?  The East River.  I'm jumping in.  I can't take it anymore.  You half a porpoise.  He takes him to the garment.  Oh, no.  Come on.  No, there's no way to do it.  No, go ahead.  I hailed you down, sir, so you could run over me.  Oh, look at the little fella trying to hop in the cab with flipper hands. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, it's just awful.  Who puts his shoes on?  Looks like, how does he put his shoes on?  You know that they're all, I guarantee you, they're all like laceless.  He slips them on.  They're all slip-on shoes.  Looks like God was hung over that morning.  Oh, wow, his face looks like Big A, kind of.  Yeah, he's got a Big A face, he's got flipper hands, and he's a fat midget.  He's got a bun.  And he has a belt.  You think he just gets sweatpants.  How does he fix the little belt?  How do you become a fat midget when you have flipper hands?  All you have to do is, like, you have to beg someone to feed you. 
[00:58:00]  It's not even really flipper.  Wait, you're not on.  Hold on, Ann.  I'm sorry about that.  What would I be?  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  What?  It's not so much flipper hands, because I see fingers there.  It looks like he's got his hands coming right out of his shoulders.  Like he's got T-Rex arms.  T-Rex arms literally has T-Rex arms where they're very, very short.  And his body, shaped like a T-Rex, very big at the bottom.  And then it gets slender at the top, and he's got a big T-Rex head. 
[00:58:30]  And he's kind of leaning in to open the cab.  And it looks like he's jumping in jolly midget fashion.  Like, you could Photoshop that, like, in a flower patch.  He's, like, up on one tippy-toe.  It looks like he's almost in midair.  If you look at the picture.  Yeah.  You could picture elf music playing.  Oompa, loompa.  That's what he is.  A little oompa loompa.  Where to the East River.  Jimmy.  Just dump him in.  Could someone explain to me how he's fat, though, if he's got flipper hands that don't reach his mouth? 
[00:59:00]  I don't know.  He probably likes all throwable food.  He eats a lot of pretzels.  Yeah, they throw things at him.  Dumplings.  Or his owners might just put the bowl on the floor.  His owners.  He eats out of the bowl on the floor.  They leave the food out.  What, Yorick?  He was trying to get out.  Why would that be honest?  Hold on, what?  He was trying to get out, but he couldn't do the door.  So the cab driver had to lean over and open the door and shut the door.  Oh, how far.  The only thing that would be great about that is if there was some kind of a car fire and the cabbie panicked and ran out.  Just watch the midget bar. 
[00:59:30]  Old broken wing arms just sitting in the back with his clipped wings.  Trying to flutter out of the cage.  Oh, Jesus.  Stupid flipper arms.  I like to just grab his arm and squeeze it and go, why are you living?  What is this?  Yeah, maybe if someone, maybe he's like a balloon.  You could squeeze that fat ass of his and let the air go into his arms and watch him pop out.  Whoop, there you go.  Open the door, idiot.  If you squeeze his bun, his arms come out. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  A little fat, awful belly.  All right.  Well, there you go.  That's up on opiananthony.com for your viewing pleasure.  You should be in a flower patch.  Please put him in a flower patch with some type of a degrading, happy, flowered midget hat.  With a little carnation on it.  Yeah.  Make him cast a spell somewhere.  Little flipper arms.  Toodley-doo.  That's the noise he probably makes everywhere he walks.  Toodley-doo.  Little fat spellcaster. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, what a burden.  What do you think his parents did?  What do you think his parents did when they finally saw that?  LSD?  Yeah, or some type of a Dylan and Eric bond.  Like, all right, look, we'll just put on one glove each and kill ourselves.  Leave him on a church steps.  Yeah, that is really hard.  That must have been a hell of a birth.  Comes out head first, you see the flipper hands, you see the butt, then you see the feet.  I think Rosemary was happier with the final product. 
[01:01:00]  But now we take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  He told me a movie that I liked him.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Jimmy, comment?  Oh, yeah.  I'm very happy.  Oh, and by the way, they're real and they're spectacular.  All sports all the time.  No excuses.  Sports Radio 1140 KSF.  The worst.  The end, Anthony.  Live to win, till you die. 
[01:01:30]  Till the light lies in your eyes.  Live to win, take it all.  Just keep fighting till you fall.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Live to win, I like it.  I mean, we only heard, what, 10 seconds of it so far, but that's the latest from Paul Stanley  who's sitting in our studio right now. 
[01:02:00]  Live to win, off the CD, live to win, of course.  I just came in for my mancation.  I know, I'm sorry.  Mancation.  Mancation.  How pathetic.  He's sitting there drinking his, you know, coffee, whatever, in the green room and waiting  and waiting and we decide to go with mancations instead of Paul Stanley, so now I'm embarrassed.  If it was great radio, then you maybe would understand.  Who would want to go away with a bunch of guys and act like you're in high school?  Well, isn't that what you did for many years?  Yeah.  I was fresh out of high school.  It's called your career.  I was fresh out of high school. 
[01:02:30]  I didn't want to just make believe they're a rock star, too.  Talking about, because we were talking during the commercial break and stuff, and it sounds  like there was a little mancationing going on early in the early days of Kiss.  Yeah, but a time and place for everything, you know.  Yeah.  There's nothing more pathetic than seeing a bunch of old guys leaving their old wives behind.  I don't know.  Going out to be guys again.  Can I have my junk back, please?  Could you take it out of your purse and I could slap it back on and be a man for a week?  It's kind of weird. 
[01:03:00]  It's funny when rock stars look at regular people like, what a bunch of nerds you are.  Got to go away and play golf.  Because all these guys do, I mean, you just basically kick chicks off.  That's got to be the fun part of being in a band like that.  You just fight over, all right, well, you banged that one, but I had that one yesterday  and I'll take this one now.  When you finally settle down, hopefully it's not somebody you want to get away from.  Jesus.  Jesus, you know, that's sort of what I was getting at.  But, yeah, but again, this is for, like, regular guys.  When you're Paul Stanley, when you've, like, looked through the filing cabinet and you've  gone through 4,500 different things, you're like, all right, I'm in love with this person now. 
[01:03:30]  Most guys might have a few, like, you know, five or six, like, that gal from college was  nice.  But, you know, when you're in Kiss and you're the front man from Kiss, man, you've gone through  quite a few different options, I'm sure.  Yeah.  It doesn't suck.  There must have just been a frenzy back in, you know.  It's been everything that people think and then more.  And more.  I mean, it's more than I could have ever imagined.  You told us all the good stuff during the commercial, so now we've got to make believe  we didn't hear any of that stuff.  Yeah, he had some good stuff.  I was talking about Ace Frehley, because I'm a big fan.  I met the band one time. 
[01:04:00]  I got a photo with the band.  It was Peter Jean, Paul, and it was Tommy in Ace's makeup, who looks just like Ace on  stage.  And, you know, Ace, I'm, like, obsessed with meeting now, because I have not, he's the  one guy in the band I haven't met.  Ace is a great guy.  He didn't make it to my show Saturday night, but he's, you know, I give him a lot of credit.  He's been fighting to stay clean and sober, and he's doing a great job of it and takes  it real seriously.  And he's one of those people who used to believe that he was a victim of everybody else's  injustices. 
[01:04:30]  And once he got his head on straight, he realized, you know, he said to me, how'd you ever put  up with me before?  And he's a great guy, and I like him more now than ever.  Do you think that, like, him or Peter, like, when they were out of the band, like, a few  years later, look back and went, I am not in Kiss anymore.  Like, what an idiot I am.  Like, why would you leave that, or why would you do what caused you to get thrown out of that  band?  I think, you know, I think there were other, you know, circumstances.  When you start mixing chemicals and everything else, and I don't think anybody's thinking  straight, no matter how much, you know, they might think so. 
[01:05:00]  I mean, here's guys who won the lottery twice, they came back into the band again, and unfortunately  found the same exit door.  That's got to be a hell of a moment of clarity, though, when your moment of clarity is, oh,  my God, wait, I was in Kiss.  You know?  It's not just like, oh, damn, I lost my car.  Or something.  It's like, wait, was I in Kiss?  What happened?  Yeah, I lost that job at the garage.  It's the door closes behind you, and it doesn't open again, you know?  Or you call people's bluff, and everybody says, there's the door. 
[01:05:30]  So when they came back, I remember, I think it was during an MTV Unplugged thing, it was  a huge moment that Peter and Ace came back out, and you guys played together.  How long did it take, say, when you decided to tour again, for the honeymoon to be over  again?  Like, oh, we still have some kind of problems here.  You know, it's like, you ever have, like, an ex-girlfriend that you go, you know, why  did I break up with her?  She was kind of, you know, she was hot, good-looking, and then you go back with her,  and on the first date, you go, now I remember.  That's the beauty of being me.  I kill them. 
[01:06:00]  So it's kind of like the time to find out you don't want to be with your exes is not  when you're in bed with them, you know?  But look, we had a great second run, made a whole lot of money, made a lot of people  happy, but unfortunately, you know, some certain, you know, individuals have problems that  just kept coming up, and, you know, by the end of the farewells, they're  hooked, or I kind of realized that I didn't want to say farewell to the fans, I wanted  to say farewell to some of the guys in the band, you know?  I didn't want to stop the band, you know?  So we're still around. 
[01:06:30]  Well, doing solo stuff, do you find that you want to do stuff that you couldn't do in  Kiss, like, you got a solo album out, are you saying to yourself, like, alright, well,  this is something that they probably would have wanted to change directions in, but I would  want to do, so you do your own thing, or is it just kind of like working with the  other three guys anyway?  Well, when you do a solo album, it's different, because when you do a band album, then I'm  writing for the strengths and weaknesses of the guys who are playing, you know, when  I do a solo album, I get to write what I want, and then bring in the people who fit  the song, so, but in terms of playing live, they're all my songs anyway, you know, it's 
[01:07:00]  kind of like all my unruly kids get to come out with me, so, you know, I mean, whether  it's Love Gun, or Detroit Rock City, or I Want You, or any of those songs, they're  mine, so, you know, I get to play those, I get to play stuff from my first solo album,  stuff from Live to Win, and it's been awesome.  Yeah, that's what surprised me, this is only your second solo album, after all these years.  Yeah, 28 years later, I said, if I wait another 28 years, the next one will be called Hope  to Live.  But seriously, folks, try the veal.  A surprise, though, you would think you would have, you know, maybe had a few more solo 
[01:07:30]  albums out there.  Well, I mean, it's no secret, some of the other guys in the band are always running off  and doing other things, and I just had this feeling that if we all run off, there won't  be a band to come back to.  So I kind of became like the, I felt like the caretaker, kind of like keeping things  afloat, and finally I reached a point where I just thought everything's pretty steady and  solid at KISS, so let me go off and do what I need to do.  And when the front man kind of goes off and does his own thing, it really conjures up, 
[01:08:00]  especially the rumor mill gets going, like, oh boy, it's got to be over.  Yeah, you know, I think that the stronger each member is, the stronger the band is.  So I'm just trying to make myself happy.  I mean, it's great to go out.  I mean, it goes back to the reasons I started playing in the first place.  It was just music.  I mean, there's no bombs, there's no pyro, it's just me on stage with a great band.  And to me, it's more like the days when I used to go to the Fillmore and see, you know,  Humble Pie, Zeppelin, Derek and the Dominoes, you know, a bunch of guys with amplifiers and 
[01:08:30]  guitars just preaching rock and roll.  So, you look back on your stuff, like, everyone has those moments, you look back on your thing,  you're like, I wish this was better.  Is there anything you look back on, like, musically, like, one song you'll hear and you go,  ugh, why did we do that like that, like, that you wish you could fix, that you just look  back on and cringe?  You know, I mean, there's some songs that I'm not crazy about, there's a couple of albums  that I'm not crazy about, but when we were doing them, they were the best we could do  at that time.  So, you know, everything I did got me here.  So, the good, the bad, the ugly, you know, that's why I'm sitting here. 
[01:09:00]  Hey, Jimmy, can you tell your Kiss story?  It's really embarrassing.  Paul is, and I'll be very honest, I'm a Sabbath freak, an Aussie freak, and a Kiss freak, but  Kiss was my first, long before Sabbath was Kiss, I'd say Paul Stanley was probably my first  idol as a kid growing up.  And I finally got to meet the band, it was, my friend Wendy is close with Gene, and it  was the dumbest luck of the garden.  And I got a photo with the band, and it's just, it's really embarrassing when I look  at him.  And I was, I was so, it was very childhood, childhood of me. 
[01:09:30]  I got to stand in front of Paul for the band, and there was like a few, three of us, four  of us, and the band's behind us.  And Paul, what he does for the photo is he puts his arm on your shoulder, like from behind,  because you have the, you have the heels on, so you're much taller.  And I was such a douche, I took my head, and I tilted it to the right, and it touched his  arm, and I, and I almost like held his, but it wasn't like a gay thing.  I probably, I know it sounds like it is, because like, you know, I really should, I should go  out onto Rikers Island with my hands gripping my ankles after this story. 
[01:10:00]  But it was like, it was like, I was like, I felt like a little kid, and then I'm like,  I'm like, what are you doing?  And I look at, I have the picture here, of course I love it signed, if you don't want to rip  it up and throw it in my fat face.  Oh, it's just horrid, and I'll show it to you.  Yeah, you gotta show him, because he kind of downplayed what he's doing.  He's holding on almost like a kid would with his father on, on a line at a ride at an amusement  park.  Oh, if this doesn't make you want to throw up, let's see if people on PalTalk can see it.  They can, because PalTalk's off right now. 
[01:10:30]  We'll be on over there.  Oh, that camera works?  Okay.  I get it, I get it.  The cool thing about Kiss is it brings everybody back to a special time.  in their lives.  I mean, when you hear Kiss, when you hear certain songs, you remember who you were sleeping  with, where you were eating food, you remember those moments in your life, and they sometimes,  meeting the band can reduce you to that childlike state. 
[01:11:00]  What a nice guy he is.  What he should have said was, Jim, you're a douche.  But he just gave the nicest explanation.  And Jim, that's not the story I was thinking about.  You're telling the easier of the two stories.  Oh, the cute one when you were a real little kid.  Your dreams.  Your dreams with Helen and...  Oh, when I was...  Well, again, this is probably even...  This is creepy.  You might want to leave after you hear this story.  I was born in 68, so I'd have to say this is 76.  Probably I was like eight years old, probably right around Destroyer time.  And I had an imaginary play friend who was named Helen. 
[01:11:30]  She was a middle-aged woman with a beehive hairdo.  I don't know what happened to me, but there's one neighbor out there with a photograph.  Check.  Yeah.  Yeah, he says it's so casual.  Yeah, so he had an imaginary friend named Helen with a beehive hairdo.  But my fantasy when I was a kid, and I know it sounds crazy, and it wasn't, again, it  wasn't perverted, it was just an odd fantasy I would have is that Kiss would show up to  my apartment with their makeup and costumes and beat me up and hurt me and throw me down  the stairs.  And then when I was sad, they would just hug me and make me feel better. 
[01:12:00]  When you were sad from being thrown down the stairs.  Of course, as you would be when your four heroes showed up and threw you down the stairs  and beat you.  After that, shortly after that, was it right after you fell?  They hug you and make you feel better, yeah.  They would come down and hug you and make you feel better.  Folks, we have all kinds of fans.  How awkward is that?  Another great answer, see?  Hey, all kinds of fans.  I understand.  He understands, Jimmy.  Wow.  And I do, I tell those stories, I'm a comic, so I tell those stories on stage, I talk about  it now, but when I realized what I had done in that photo, and again, I don't want it 
[01:12:30]  to come off like it's a homoerotic thing, because I can't even look at it, it's like  really douche shit.  Yeah, I bet.  But I look back on it, you're like, what's the matter with me?  I'm a 30-year-old man.  I swear to you, I think when we went out on the Grammys, before we went out on the reunion  tour, we surprised everybody by walking out and giving one of the awards, and we'd been  gone for like 17 years.  And we came, the four of us walked out, and I never saw so many bands in an audience turn 
[01:13:00]  six years old.  I mean, everybody's eyes got big.  And you know, these guys from these very serious bands suddenly were, you know, they were kids  again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's about kids that's eternal, and timeless, and you know, as long as we can slap on that  makeup and not eat too much, we pretty much look the same.  My dad took me to see you guys in a, I want to say you were working with Cheap Trick, I  don't remember if they were open for you.  Yeah, Cheap Trick, we took them out of the clubs and took them on their first tour.  Was that the first concert your father took you to, or what was the first concert? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I remember there might have been another show before that.  I don't remember any other concert my father might have taken me to.  Oh, come on.  Do tell.  Yeah, which one was that again?  Well, there was Ellen with you.  You and your dad.  I don't know what.  And Ellen, you bought three seats just in case you showed up.  Well, it was, um, it was, uh, it was the infamous Village People Sister Sledge Tour.  Village People Sister Sledge.  I missed that one.  Yeah, it was really, it was really good, probably, because you were, you know, with  girls, that's why you missed it.  I don't know what's the matter with me.  With his dad, Village People Sister Sledge. 
[01:14:00]  Village People, they must have thought we were some kind of a weird, like, Chelsea couple.  I don't know why he would take me to that, because I liked We Are Family, but I mean,  I think I kind of liked the Village People.  I think Felipe Rose was my favorite, the Indian.  I always thought he was the coolest of the Village People I had to choose.  But I don't remember if that was before or after Kiss, to be honest.  Yeah.  But, uh, I, I want to say, it was December 16th, I know that, because I actually bought  a bus ad off of, uh.  That was, uh, I think it was 1977, and it was, uh, there were three nights at the garden.  Yes, it was.  It was the final night.  There you go. 
[01:14:30]  Final night at the garden, and my dad actually just got, I bought off a, there was a bus  ad I bought off eBay.  It was the Alive 2, it looked like the Alive 2 cover.  And, uh, so I went and saw you guys in 96, and it was amazing how it was choreographed the  same.  It was like, it was great, brought you right back, because it wasn't.  A bunch of bitter guys, uh, playing, you know, just to get the money.  It was like the same show, which was amazing.  We were, like, determined to make sure that people got what they remembered, not necessarily  what it actually was, because the shows during the 70s were small, but they were bigger than 
[01:15:00]  everybody else.  So what we had to do was, was multiply it and bring back what people, you know, what  those legendary shows were, which was very different than what actually, you know, existed.  Oh my God, you wouldn't think that, you know, you kind of remember things a lot bigger.  Yeah.  And it's like when, I don't know if you ever go back to, like, an old house that you  lived in when you were a kid, and you go, it's so small, you know.  But, uh, same thing, we had to build, like, this show that was actually not the real show,  but was what people fantasized that show to be.  And then we made everybody go to the gym.  Everybody had trainers.  I mean, the worst thing would have been to have, you know, this band come back and look 
[01:15:30]  like, you know, meatloaf.  Well, that's where the problem was, because Ann and I went and saw the Comeback tour in  Boston, and we noticed you guys are still in great shape with the makeup, and then we  looked at the audience, and, ooh, they were trying to, like, just squeeze into their old  rock outfits.  They should have hit the gym before they hit the KISS concert.  A good night was had by all.  There you go.  He ain't trashin' anybody.  Everyone enjoyed the show. 
[01:16:00]  We enjoyed looking around and seeing girls that probably were hot back in the day and trying  to wear the same exact.  I was looking at their daughters.  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  Well, that's the beauty of being in the band, is, like, you can, like, pass the mothers off  to the other audience members and then hit the daughters.  That's got to be the beautiful part of it.  Two generations of banging.  In the late 70s, when KISS became much more family-oriented and more family-friendly, we would  have all these moms bring their kids.  And, you know, we'd be on stage, and you'd see, like, this hot mom with, like, a seven-year-old, 
[01:16:30]  and you'd go, you know, C-Day, row 13.  You know, you'd tell your guy, and lo and behold, you know, mom would bring little Jimmy  backstage after the show, and you'd send him for autographs and say hi to his mom.  And she'd earn the signatures.  How great is that?  How fantastic.  The amazing thing about KISS is that you were so, like, probably the best photograph band  ever.  Like, you guys so understood what work, whether it was the Chopper poster series, or the, 
[01:17:00]  I mean, what brilliant idea, the comics, the KISS comic books that you had, like, your own  blood taken out and put into the ink.  When we put blood into the red ink, I was just happy they didn't want anything for the  yellow ink.  I mean, it's just like, yeah.  You're a god to make the brown.  You might have liked that.  But it was like, conceptually, you guys were so great, and then you did the four solo albums,  almost like so everybody could get that off their chest or get it out of their systems  without the band breaking up.  This man does, either you did your homework or you're the true fan.  Oh, no, I'm the fan.  He is the ultimate.  Awesome.  I had no questions pre-planned. 
[01:17:30]  The only thing I pre-planned to ask you was, is there anything, because we get trashed  on message boards and stuff, is there anything the fans have trashed you for?  Like, we're going to catch a little crap where you're like, ugh, why do you have to bash  that?  Like, is there one thing that they went after you for that really bothered you more than  anything?  Like, that they shouldn't have trashed you for?  No, you know, everything's, you should see the house that Bad Reviews built.  I mean, everything's, it's all good, you know?  People can say what they want.  There's once in a while, like, a fan will just say one thing, like, they criticize me 
[01:18:00]  for this, that, okay, but then there's that one thing, it's like, ugh, why that?  Why don't you get what I'm doing there?  Everything else you can trash, but that, could you leave alone?  Nah.  He can just go, you know, C-3-0-A.  Yeah, it's all good.  It's all good.  And everything's all better again.  Yeah, I want to get back to that.  Did you guys have just one guy that would take care of that for you and get the hotties backstage?  In the very early days, we had something called the chicken coop.  I know it's not very, you know, socially acceptable to call it that, but.  It's a different time.  We had a room at the end of the show that was full at the hotel of all the women, and 
[01:18:30]  we'd go back to our hotel rooms, take off the makeup and all that, and you get a phone  call, you know, chicken coop's room 317.  You know, and you'd go down and, you know, you'd pick your playmate for the evening.  Wow.  How afraid of you were, were you with cameras?  Because, like, the thing in the 70s, was there a photo of Kiss?  Was that really Gene with Cher?  Or a photo, which, when you look back, there were actually some photos taken of you guys  who would always deny.  Yeah, but it was so funny, because I think that media didn't want to, you know, want to 
[01:19:00]  kill a good thing, so.  Yeah, back then, they played along.  Nowadays, it's completely different, because, like, they talk about how everyone knew about  Kennedy banging broads in the White House, but the media was like, ah, that's none of  our business.  Now, of course, it's changed.  Yeah, you look back at all these presidents and what they were doing, and now, Jesus, I  mean, you know what they had for breakfast, but then, you know, what was going on with  Kennedy or Johnson or any of those guys was, or Hoover.  Gee, the mystique of the whole.  Oh, he was a naughty one, that J. Edgar.  Yeah, that J. Edgar Hoover, that was one for you. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, he was a saucy one.  Him and Mark Foley would have had a lovely IM chat.  You know, so, what figurine are you dressing up like?  He, he.  And if you don't know what we're talking about, you can look it up on the Google.  The Google, right.  The Google.  Just put in parentheses, Clyde Tolson and J. Edgar Hoover, and they'll probably come out  in one, you know.  That's right, Clyde Tolson.  Yeah, how do you not love him?  I mean, Melvin Purvis, he had, like, a whole thing for her, but they kind of.  Melvin Purvis, gee, man.  Yes.  Yeah, of course.  And I'm so, I actually really liked the CD a lot.  I don't mean actually, like, I was surprised, but you never know, like, when somebody that 
[01:20:00]  you love is putting something out, you always want it to be good, like, it's always nervous,  and I got an advanced copy, and I really dug it, man.  I liked it a lot.  I liked it, you know.  Some people said to me they expected something that would sound like the continuation of the first  solo album.  It was 28 years later, so, you know, to go in and do a retro album, the last thing I  wanted to do was try to pick up where I left off.  It's a long time ago.  So, but the heart and soul of the album's the same.  I mean, you know, the things that I loved about music are all in there, and, you know, 
[01:20:30]  the philosophy is the same.  I mean, what got me where I am is that, you know, live to win.  You pick your goals, you pick what you aspire to do, and you don't let anybody get in the  way.  So that way, at least if you fail, you still win.  I mean, if you lose on your own terms, you're still a winner.  Have you and Gene ever had a little discussion about his maybe being a little overzealous  with the marketing of Kiss?  Sure.  Sure.  You know, look, we're very different people, and as much as possible, we try to stay eye 
[01:21:00]  to eye on Kiss stuff.  But, you know, sometimes things that he does outside of Kiss, somehow, you know, it's kind  of like the tar baby.  It gets stuck to Kiss when it really has nothing to do with us.  I mean, you know, I can't stop him from doing his whatever he is doing today.  Whatever he is doing.  And somehow what gets tagged on, understandably, is Gene Simmons of Kiss.  Right.  But, you know, I mean, reality TV, I'd rather take a bullet in the head. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  You know, I mean, but, you know.  I mean, do you, as a member of Kiss, does it kind of get to you that there's so much  overexposure because of what kind of how many products he's putting out and different types  of products that really have nothing to do with the band?  It's pretty much just the name and then, you know, get the product out.  I mean, we put out a lot of products, but the truth is that we would never put out anything  that people don't want.  You know, I mean, you'd be an idiot to put out merchandise and nobody buys. 
[01:22:00]  So my problem is never with the merchandise.  I just don't think that you have to stand on a soapbox and tell everybody, you know,  all about it.  You know, there's, you know, I would just prefer everything be out there and people  will buy it and we're not waving our hands going, look what we're selling.  Gotcha.  How was it doing Phantom of the Opera?  It was very cool.  You know, it was another, you know, anytime I can do something that kind of pushes the  envelope is very cool.  So to do eight shows a week in a legit, you know, show and I think it had run 10 years 
[01:22:30]  in Toronto and I did the last six months, eight shows a week, standing ovations every  show.  That's great.  It's a lot of work, huh?  Yeah, hard, man.  You know, I mean, it brought a whole different sensibility to, you know, bands coming in  and saying, my finger hurts or I hurt my toe.  Yeah.  You know, these people go out there and kill it every night, you know, eight times a week.  We are getting, the music is starting, which we have on a computer because we're on a three  hour time and then the next show comes in and we do the walkover for XM.  So I think Paul is doing the walkover with us.  Yeah, I'm hearing this nice crowd outside. 
[01:23:00]  And it's called Live to Win.  It's your first solo album in 28 years.  I mean, it's real easy as a fan to say I love the CD, but I did love the CD.  I mean, you know, it's so comfortable to say that.  I probably would have lied anyway because I love Paul Stanley and your voice is held up  great.  Thank you.  It just kicks ass.  Yeah, the CDs live to win.  The first singles live to win.  What's that?  What does Helen think?  Helen loved it very much.  Her and Jimmy Robinson, who was kind of like Jimmy Norton, but in a cape.  And Helen, me and Jimmy Robinson hated Jimmy Norton.  I don't know what happened, but there's some older gentleman with a story to tell, I'm sure. 
[01:23:30]  That's true, too.  He's been telling this story for many, many years.  Kissology, we were just talking before you came in.  Is it all this old, six hours of old footage and live?  Yeah.  Vintage concerts from San Francisco, Houston, Detroit.  Us rehearsing without makeup in the early days.  Us playing a club in the early days.  That's cool.  Very cool stuff.  That's great.  Better than buying a bootleg, because the quality is there.  The whole show is there.  This is first generation stuff.  All right, they're going to cut us off.  Paul Stanley, thank you.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  The worst of Mookie and Anthony. 
[01:24:00]  I know.  But right now, we've got to say hi to Ben Stein, Anthony.  Ben Stein.  Hey, Ben.  Hi, how are you?  There he is.  Look there.  Did I just hear you do an ad where you said somebody was going to chew down the price of  a car?  No, he said chew down.  You just said chew down.  That's a lot different.  We wouldn't say Jew down on a commercial.  We would say it during the show.  I do.  But not during a paid advertisement, Ben.  Okay.  You being of Jewish background, I would take it, Ben. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, of course.  And if we were going to say something like that, we certainly wouldn't say it just before  we talked to Ben Stein.  Talked to Ben Stein.  I see.  You sure fooled me.  Oh, my God.  Are we going to get off on a bad foot with Ben Stein right from the start?  Well, I really think that's a jackass thing to do.  But we said chew down.  Well, it sounds just like Jew down.  Oh, my God.  Well, I mean, come on.  That's a crappy thing to do.  That's just an absolutely explicit invitation to racism. 
[01:25:00]  Well, it's a term that is used.  Chew.  Not Jew.  I wouldn't have said Jew down.  Chew down.  You know, you'd say like a beaver would go at a tree.  He would chew down the tree.  Well, it sounds just like Jew down.  And anybody who's listening to it is going to know you're saying Jew down with a tiny,  tiny chain in the accent.  It sounds like Jew down.  Oh, my God, Ben.  Are you this insane? 
[01:25:30]  Are you actually this insanely crazy that you're arguing over chew or Jew down?  Hello, Ben?  I think he just hung up.  Ben Stein just hung up.  I got hung up on by Ben Stein.  Whip about Wednesday.  Look at this big book.  Wow, she's got, wow.  I bet they are so beautiful to just look at.  Boo.  Genius.  This is Colin Quinn.  You listen to the worst of Opie and Anthony, and the best is Lady Diane Marion, so you can  imagine the worst.  Okay, well, what a crazy, crazy show this has become once again today, Anthony. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, I know.  Like today would be different.  I don't know what it is.  There's this aura that this show has now that is just bringing out the friggin' lunatics.  Well, you know, a lot of people want us to start interviewing, you know, more celebrities  and stuff, and on a daily basis, you should see the people we turn down, because we know  they just don't know how to play the Opie and Anthony game.  They blow.  They blow.  They have an agenda.  They don't want to have fun.  They think it's going to suck, so they don't try. 
[01:26:30]  There are certain people that can walk through that door, sit down, and become part of this  show.  So we go through a list of people that call this show and want to get on to plug their  stuff or whatever it is, and we go, no, no, no, no, no.  We know this one isn't going to be good, because you could tell.  Now, Ben Stein, we figure, what the hell?  Comedy Central, we have a good relationship with them.  They give us some fun guests that we've had on this program. 
[01:27:00]  So we'll throw him a bomb.  He gets on, and right after we were doing a commercial, where I guess I said people will  be on the phone when you're trying to sell your car and try to chew down the price.  Chew down the price.  Yeah, that's what I said.  It's the car cash commercial.  Try to chew down the price.  That's exactly what you said.  We got the tape, we have a ton of our listeners as witnesses, we get Ben Stein is on hold  at this point.  Hey, we're guilty for saying some really stupid stuff on this show.  But goddamn, call us for that. 
[01:27:30]  I'm not going to sit here and act like I'm a choir boy or anything.  We're definitely guilty for saying some stuff.  And we don't care about that stuff either.  But we don't like being accused of something that we didn't do.  Because he was convinced you said chew down.  Especially during a commercial.  And then when you explain yourself, then he was trying to cover his ass and say, well,  it sounded too close.  It sounds like it.  And if it sounds like it, people are going to think it is it.  I'm a douche.  Oh, so he's on hold during the commercial. 
[01:28:00]  I say chew down the price.  He starts up.  The first thing out of his mouth is he's got this attitude that how could, you know,  did I just hear someone say, chew down the price?  I said, no, not bad.  I said, chew.  Chew.  And then you explained yourself.  And then he just rambles on it, making no sense.  We got the tape.  I started laughing because I thought he was making, you know, a joke.  That I thought it was so insane, it had to be a joke.  No one could possibly be this serious about something sounding like something.  All right.  So real fast, let's play like only 15 seconds of the commercial where Anthony was explaining, 
[01:28:30]  you know, what car cash does and used the term chew, C-H-E-W, down.  Chew down.  Right.  Here it is.  Three in the morning, you're getting calls from people.  God forbid there's a misprint in the paper.  All of a sudden, your Corvette is being sold for 20 bucks and you're getting calls at all  hours from people.  It's a big pain in the ass.  And then the person that comes over the house and tries to chew down the value of your car  and he's looking underneath saying, wow, it seems to be something with the Ida-Bama muffler 
[01:29:00]  bearing.  There it is.  Try to chew down the price of your car as in nibbling away at the price.  So right after the commercial, we get back into the show and Ben Stein is on our hotline.  He was on hold, so he heard the commercial on his phone.  But right now we got to say hi to Ben Stein, Anthony.  Ben Stein.  Hey, Ben.  Hi, how are you?  Did I just hear you do an ad where you said somebody was going to chew down the price 
[01:29:30]  of a car?  No, he said chew down.  You just said chew down.  Oh, that's a lot different.  We wouldn't say chew down on a commercial.  We would say it during the show.  I see.  But not during a paid advertisement, Ben.  Okay.  And you being of Jewish background, I would take it, Ben.  Yeah, of course.  And if we were going to say something like that, we certainly wouldn't say it just before  we talked to Ben Stein.  Talked to Ben Stein.  I see.  You sure fooled me.  Oh, my God.  Are we going to get off on a bad foot with Ben Stein right from the start?  Well, I really think that's a jackass thing to do. 
[01:30:00]  But we said chew down.  Well, it sounds just like chew down.  Oh, my God.  Well, I mean, come on.  That's a crappy thing to do.  That's just an absolutely explicit invitation to racism.  Well, it's a term that is used, chew, not Jew.  I wouldn't have said Jew down.  Chew down.  You know, you'd say like a beaver would go at a tree.  He would chew down the tree.  Well, it sounds just like Jew down. 
[01:30:30]  And anybody who's listening to it is going to know you're saying Jew down with a tiny,  tiny chain.  Oh, my God.  Ben, are you this insane?  Are you actually this insanely crazy that you're arguing over chew or Jew down?  Hello, Ben?  I think he just hung up.  Ben Stein just hung up.  I got hung up on my Ben Stein.  People are going to know that you said Jew. 
[01:31:00]  No, they're not going to know I said Jew because I didn't, you idiot.  How could he try to turn that around?  You said Jew, but people are going to know you said Jew.  Ben, how are they going to know I said something I didn't say, you frigging lunatic idiot?  Carol, what's going on?  You know, I got a complaint.  Yeah.  I'm offended.  All right.  Did he just say car gash?  Yes, Carol.  No, it was cash, but sounded like gash.  Oh.  And it's offensive to all women.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:31:30]  All right, Carol.  All right, take care.  Hi, I'm an asswipe.  We were doing him in Comedy Central a favor.  Unbelievable.  You know something?  If someone even has an iota of a reason to be upset with us, fine.  That came so far out of left field for no frigging reason.  Unbelievable.  Ben.  Ben Stein's calling back.  Ben.  Hello.  Ben.  Hello.  Ben Stein, everyone.  I'm back. 
[01:32:00]  What's the problem, man?  Well, I was a little upset with the Jew comment.  No, Anthony said chew.  Chew down.  Chew down.  Chew down.  Yes.  Unbelievable.  The blatant racism going on in your program.  If it was about the **** or the ****, I wouldn't care.  But my own people.  Yeah.  The Jew.  Yeah.  Well, Anthony definitely said chew and not Jew. 
[01:32:30]  I don't care.  Chew.  That's a derogatory term for a ****.  A chew.  A chew.  All right, screw it.  I'll be right back.  All right.  That was good.  Please.  Yeah.  What happens when someone sneezes?  A chew.  What?  What was that?  I can't believe you just said that. 
[01:33:00]  The man lost his mind sometime back in the friggin' 70s working with Nixon.  Where's Ben Stein?  Where's the Jew?  Well, everyone knows Richard Nixon.  Big anti-Semite.  I had to deal with Henry Kissinger.  And that Jew Ben Stein.  Hey, you're not going to try to Jew me down.  Where's Liddy?  I'm only going to pay him so much to break into the hotel.  I don't want Liddy trying to Jew me down like Ben Stein. 
[01:33:30]  I'm only paying him so much for speeches.  He keeps trying to Jew me down.  The guy's a madman.  Hey, Frank, what's going on?  You know, he's a hypocrite.  If he's going to be this super sensitive, bear with me here a second.  John Mitchell, another Jew.  Don't you think he could misinterpret the whole point of his show as being an anti-Semitic stereotype?  Explain.  What's that?  Go ahead, explain.  Well, try to win money from a Jewish man who's traditionally stereotypically cheap. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, his whole show is based on the fact that it's his personal money.  Yeah.  And he will do anything in his power to keep from giving you one buck.  Right.  So you have to beat him in this game show format to win my money, which I will defend like a Jew.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, and he hates giving it away.  Hey, when people win, he gets all upset.  Boy, really busting down those stereotypes.  I guess it's okay when they put the check in your pocket. 
[01:34:30]  How the hell do you get upset because something sounds like something else?  That is so friggin' dangerous.  We're reaching a point in this country where you can't even say stuff that sounds like something else.  Oh, my God.  Hey, now it sounds like something that sounded like something.  Utter a word and get your head chopped off.  Oh, my God.  He's a hypocrite.  That's all he is.  He's a hypocrite.  You won't have Richard Nixon to kick around anymore, you Jews.  I had to deal with Kissinger for many years. 
[01:35:00]  Always trying to Jew me down.  Checkers.  Come here, Checkers, boys.  Checkers.  He's my watchdog.  He watches for Jews and **** coming on Pennsylvania Avenue.  Hey, go fly a ****.  I mean kite.  Where's Archibald Cox?  That Jew.  Excuse me, Mr. President.  I thought you said Jew. 
[01:35:30]  I did.  I said cheap Jew.  Write that into a speech, Ben.  Cheap Jew.  We'll make friends with the Arabs and get the oil.  All right, Mr. President.  As long as you pay me.  I don't care.  As long as I'm making my money.  Good, good ****, Ben.  You're one of my favorite Jews.  Along with Hank Kissinger.  Eat me.  Eat me, Ben Stein. 
[01:36:00]  Suck it.  Okay.  Mr. President, we're going to have to write you a speech about the bombing of Cambodia.  Who cares about those little ****, Ben?  We don't care about them.  Let's all get naked with Henry Kissinger and form a daisy chain.  Okay, how much?  Hey, Ben.  You want to hear a good one? 
[01:36:30]  Okay, Mr. President.  What's the object of a Jew football game?  I don't know, Mr. President.  What is it?  To get the quarterback.  Get it?  Get it, Ben?  Ha, ha, ha.  Very funny, Mr. President.  Yeah.  Funny, because you're a Jew.  Hey, Ben.  How do you fit a hundred Jews in a Volkswagen?  I don't know, Mr. President. 
[01:37:00]  How?  You throw a penny in.  See?  Because you're chief.  All you Jews.  Henry found the...  He knew that joke.  Hey, Ben.  Two Jews walk into a bar.  Yes, Mr. President.  They own it.  See?  Because they own everything.  Holy Toledo.  You're my favorite **** speech writer, Ben. 
[01:37:30]  I like being surrounded by Jews.  Ben Stein.  Henry Kissinger.  Stop it.  Hey, Ben.  Here's another one.  Knock, knock.  Who's there, Mr. President?  Jew.  Jew who?  You.  You're a Jew.  I'm still working on that one.  Maybe you can write it for me, Ben.  You're my speech writer.  Jew, have a nice day.  Ha, ha. 
[01:38:00]  Very funny, Mr. President.  Albeit, laugh your balls off in Poughkeepsie.  I'm over here now.  I'm dying over here.  I'm dying over here.  Where's my paycheck?  Where's Liddy?  He's no Jew.  That's a bad one.  But I misuse his characters.  Hey, it was Dick Nixon saying it. 
[01:38:30]  All right, listen.  We got that.  Let's regroup, Anthony.  Hey, regroup.  Pull back.  Ben, write me a speech of how to get our boys out of Vietnam.  Get them away from those little t*** and back here with the Jews where they belong.  How come there's only t*** fighting for our country, Ben, and no Jews?  It's amazing.  It's spectacular.  It's...  Whip about Wednesday. 
[01:39:00]  Wow.  Boobies.  What do they like anyway?  They look pretty good.  Are they real?  What do you do with them?  Motorboat?  You play the motorboat?  Wow.  Who says Vegas isn't a sports town?  We're Vegas' sports station.  Dan Patrick is back in Las Vegas at 9.  Sports Radio 1140 KSFN.  Hey, this is Michael Shiklis.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Let's go.  We're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:39:30]  Good morning to everybody!  Except you.  Yeah, you.  You know who you are.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  You know who you are.  I don't say good morning to you!  Cancer commercials, Anthony.  We got two to play today.  Well, the cancer box song is just terrific.  And that's a commercial?  Yeah, yeah.  But first we got a commercial that they were running for the election that just passed us by. 
[01:40:00]  Some kind of bill.  I think.  I don't know.  Let's take a listen and see what this is about.  Figure it out.  I spilled my first cigarette at the age of 14.  At the age of 48, I got throat cancer.  If you don't want this to happen to your child or someone you love, please vote yes on Amendment 3.  Amendment 3 creates youth, anti-smoking programs, and helps smokers quit. 
[01:40:30]  When you step into that voting booth on Tuesday, think of your kids.  Remember my voice.  Vote yes on Amendment 3.  Thank God the government is there to take care of us.  Because we can't take care of ourselves.  Can't figure out that smoking's bad for you.  So the amendment is what?  Oh, Jimmy doesn't agree.  No, I don't know.  I'm up in the air on this one.  I don't know what the whole thing is, though.  It sounds like, hey, it protects the kids, but what is it, really? 
[01:41:00]  That type of crap annoys me, although the smoking industry in this one, they for so long lied about what was in their thing, purposefully being deceitful.  It's not like they were being honest all along.  Yeah, I get all that.  That was what I like to call the good old days.  I was going to say, yeah, it's not the 50s anymore.  It's 2006.  I'm amazed there are people out there that don't know smoking is really bad for you.  Menthol's good for your throat.  That's pretty much what they were saying back then about cigarettes.  Filter?  Who needs them? 
[01:41:30]  Hey, just smoke your Lucky or your Chesterfield.  They would say, like, you know, nine of ten doctors recommend Chesterfield.  It's got a smooth draw.  These cool words for it.  Smooth draw.  Silky feeling on your throat.  Like it actually helped your throat.  And helps combat lung fever.  Weren't the Lucky Strike ones the best?  Lucky's ruled.  Let me see.  This is an old school Lucky Strike commercial. 
[01:42:00]  Look, you're already winning with the music.  Lucky Strike.  First again with Tobacco Men.  First again with Tobacco Men.  Disjointed.  LSMFT. 
[01:42:30]  LSMFT.  Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  Ew.  Yes, in a cigarette, it's the tobacco that counts.  And Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  So round.  So firm.  Ooh.  So fully packed.  So free and easy on the draw.  On the draw.  So for your own real deep down smoking enjoyment, smoke that smoke of fine tobacco.  Lucky Strike. 
[01:43:00]  And remember, cigarette paper is white.  Even the paper that is rolled around that fine tobacco is white.  Just like your neighborhood if you smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Lucky Strike.  The favorite cigarette of white people.  If you want a white's only cigarette, smoke Lucky's, not like those mentholated Negro cigarettes. 
[01:43:30]  So pick up a Lucky and help win the war against Hitler and the Japs and the Negroes.  Smoke and Lucky.  Easy on the jaw.  Easy on the throat.  Recommended by every doctor.  Cancer?  Cancer?  What's that?  Never heard of it.  Smoking Lucky gets rid of tumors.  We don't even know what tumors are.  But it gets rid of them.  You'll find out in the future.  When there are no more negros. 
[01:44:00]  The good old days.  We're trying to find the good cigarette ads.  Where the doctors endorse smoking and all that.  Of course they lied.  We got them.  I just...  There was a point, though, where I don't think they knew.  Look at medical technology back then.  They're a bunch of dopes.  What did they know?  Sucking smoke into your lungs?  Harmful?  Stop it.  Stop it, please.  We were stupid. 
[01:44:30]  We didn't know anything.  If man exceeds 30 miles per hour for any length of time, he will surely perish.  Nine.  One of my favorites, when the train came out, people couldn't do 30 miles an hour.  Yeah.  For any length of time, or they will surely perish.  That's what they said.  Really?  That's what some dope said.  Yeah.  Ew.  30.  Hey, I think I found the cigarette ad where the doctors endorse smoking.  Ah, let's talk to a doctor.  According to a recent nationwide survey, more doctors smoke camels than any other cigarette. 
[01:45:00]  Three leading independent research organizations ask this question of 113,597 doctors.  Wow.  What cigarette do you smoke, doctor?  The brand name most was Camel.  Now, you probably enjoy rich, full flavor and cool mildness in a cigarette just as much  as doctors do.  That's why, if you're not a Camel smoker now, try a Camel on your T-Zone.  That's T for taste and T for throat.  Your true proving ground for any cigarette. 
[01:45:30]  See if Camel's rich flavor of superbly blended choice tobacco isn't extra delightful to your taste.  See if Camel's cool mildness isn't in harmony with your throat.  See if you, too, don't say Camel's suit my T-Zone to a T.  And then the doctor tells you about the C-Zone you have in your lungs and all over your neck.  Isn't that amazing, though?  Doctors actually got doctors to endorse.  That long ago, they knew there was a problem, though. 
[01:46:00]  The fact that they would have doctors endorsing it that long ago, they knew.  You're like, why would you go to doctors?  They knew.  Like, why would you go to doctors out of all the people?  Why not, you know, have these construction workers love Lucky?  Like, doctors, look, we know this stuff really screws you up, but look, doctors smoke.  Well, no, it happened.  If you know anything about marketing, the word was getting around.  Yeah.  And the cigarette industry needed a big one to help them out.  So they probably did a little payola, plugola with the doctors saying, 
[01:46:30]  look, hey, you want a brand new sports car?  Say something good.  Say something good.  We can't let the word out that people's lungs are turning into Swiss cheese.  Let's go to Bruce.  Would you please give us a little endorsement?  Yeah, let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, Bruce.  Yeah, hey, they talk about protecting the children with these ads.  What about when the Flintstones were hawking cigarettes?  Yeah, we played that one.  That's part of it, yeah.  Winston.  It's also...  Thank you.  These guys, they have to sign these non-disclosure acts. 
[01:47:00]  You can't talk about anything that you learn in the tobacco.  They're just scumbags.  I mean, they've really dug their own financial grave as far as I'm concerned.  They've been complete scum with the public.  But they're still doing very well.  Absolutely.  And I think it's more worldwide, too, because they don't have to adhere to all those rules.  And people around the world love the American cigarettes.  They're being smashed in the U.S. good, though.  Here's the Flintstones ad.  I don't know.  Smoking's coming back with the kids.  It's coming back with the kids.  Oh, good.  Good to see. 
[01:47:30]  They sure work hard, don't they, Barney?  Yeah.  I hate to see them work so hard.  Yeah, me too.  And let's go around back when we can't see them.  Gee, we ought to do something, Fred.  Okay.  How's about taking a nap?  Hey, I got a better idea.  Let's take a Winston break.  That's it.  Winston is the one filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack.  Winston's got that filter blend.  Yeah, Fred. 
[01:48:00]  Filter blend makes the big taste difference, and only Winston has it up front where it counts.  Here, ahead of the pure white filter, Winston packs rich tobacco specially selected and specially  processed for good flavor in filter smoking.  Yeah, Barney, Winston tastes good like a cigarette chute.  The Flintstone has been brought to you by Winston, America's best-selling, best-tasting filter cigarette. 
[01:48:30]  Winston tastes good like a cigarette chute.  Cigarette chute.  How crazy is that?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Smoke a Winston.  Everybody smokin'.  Get the cancer.  And even back then, Honus Wagner's card is so valuable, that baseball card, because he  had it yanked, because he didn't want to put in cigarette packs because he didn't want  kids smoking.  That's why the Honus Wagner card is so rare. 
[01:49:00]  That's the reason?  Yeah.  Really?  No clue.  He did not want kids buying cigarettes to get his card.  And that's why that card is so-  So rare.  Phenomenally rare.  So even back in the- what, 1911 or whatever that was?  They just knew.  Yeah, they knew.  Well, now the cigarette ads are a lot different.  Here's the latest one.  Finally, we get to the Cancer Box song.  Listen to this.  You don't know we die from tobacco.  Sometimes you just lose a love. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, you don't know we die from tobacco.  Sometimes they just sniff out your tongue.  And you won't sing for the acting with a big hole in your neck.  Because you don't always die from tobacco.  I like it.  Don't always die from tobacco.  Yeah, so you might not be dead, but you'll be talking through one of those.  That to me was scary.  That scared me into quitting smoking. 
[01:50:00]  You can't scare a smoker or a drinker into quitting.  That was what got me.  It was the idea of having a piece of my jaw taken out or drooling into a bag.  It wasn't death.  Death is like this intangible thing that none of us can.  Yeah, all right.  When you're dead, you're dead.  But that was like, man, to have to live with a piece of your tongue gone or a piece of your jaw cut out.  That really freaked me out.  Well, there you go.  I'm thinking that maybe the listeners could come up with their own cigarette ads.  It's a good song.  What do you think?  You like that one?  Yeah, I like the voice, but the song was good. 
[01:50:30]  We could give it a try.  Have the listeners come up with their own cigarette ads.  I was trying to see what they died of.  What?  The guys that did the Flintstones.  The voices.  Hopefully they were shot for making an unfunny cartoon.  I hated the Flintstones.  You didn't like the Flintstones, did you?  No, I hated the Flintstones.  Hey, Bonnie, shut up.  Why shut up?  It was one of the greatest cartoons ever, Jimmy.  It never made me laugh once.  Based on, you know, the Honeymooners. 
[01:51:00]  I know, I know.  It just took a little toodaloo noise that they would make.  That's when they were walking on their tippy toes.  I hated it.  I liked that.  Mel Blanc was heart disease.  Bonnie was great.  I just didn't like the Flintstones.  That's too bad.  I know.  That big dumb dinosaur.  Let's say hi to Dan in Youngstown.  Dan, what's up?  There it is.  We had that noise ready.  That's Fred Bowling.  Hello?  Yeah, Dan.  What's up?  Yes, sir.  Hey, I'm a long-time listener. 
[01:51:30]  Appreciate you guys.  A lot of fun.  Good to see you in the morning.  I wanted to give a response to that Chinese answer you had.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, the Japanese.  It's Japanese.  We know that much.  All right.  Dude, the bottom line is this.  The smoking commercials, they've just brought it on themselves.  I have no mercy for them.  All right.  I just don't.  I don't.  I have no mercy.  Even though it's a legal product and you should be able to advertise, I have no mercy for them.  Yeah, but didn't you think like Wilma and Betty were hot?  No.  Rebels. 
[01:52:00]  Their cartoon character.  Betty was better than Wilma.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, Wilma was more of the house.  No.  White thing.  Betty had a little wild streak.  No.  Stop.  And her womb was barren.  They had to adopt Bam Bam.  I saw Betty's Craigslist and it says she speaks Greek.  There you go.  All right.  I was ready to yell, hack radio alert, but Jimmy helped us out.  Yeah.  You know, many DJs have done that bit.  Who do you think is the hottest cartoon chick?  Well, take your calls now. 
[01:52:30]  Who do you think is the hottest cartoon chick?  I think Wilma.  What do you think, Anthony?  Velma.  Velma?  Velma from Scooby-Doo.  Why Velma?  Because she seems like she would work harder.  Yeah.  Jimmy, who do you think is the hottest cartoon chick?  Dora the Explorer.  Saving us from hack radio again.  Jim Norton.  Dan, go ahead.  Hey, what's going on?  How are you guys doing?  Welcome aboard, Dan.  All right.  My grandmother, when we were cleaning out of our apartment, had an advertisement with John Wayne on it. 
[01:53:00]  And it said, exercise your lungs, advertising some cigarette.  It just seemed ridiculous.  Exercise your lungs?  He certainly did.  His lungs got a workout when they were like, one, two, three, four, pull it out.  Pull it out.  And I heard he had 40 pounds of food in his colon.  Someone said that.  Because back then, you know.  Really?  Yeah.  I heard it was so impacted and stuff.  It was just bad eating.  All he did was have big steaks. 
[01:53:30]  Of course.  Just drank gravy and smoked cigarettes.  Down at the Brown Derby.  Oh, the Duke lived it up.  Yeah, of course he did.  If you asked the Duke, if you wanted to die at soda, he'd spit in your face.  Yes.  Well, every movie you see here.  He was a real man.  Yeah, well.  He didn't die from the lung cancer, though, did he?  I think he did die from cancer.  Yeah, but they're saying he died because they were making one of those westerns in the area  where they were testing nuclear weapon training.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nuclear explosion.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that must have been.  Nuclear testing. 
[01:54:00]  I mean, maybe we can find the story.  They're saying a ton of people from this one particular movie died of cancer.  Yeah.  And they're looking at the whole fact that they were filming this movie in the desert  where they were doing some...  Atomic bomb testing.  Atomic bomb testing.  A young hawk already brought something up that said John Wayne died of stomach cancer on June 11th, 1979.  1979, yes.  Is that it?  Hey, Dan, can you give us that commercial?  We'd love to play it.  I don't know where it is. 
[01:54:30]  Dan!  Now I'm listening to myself.  Dan!  No, I was just on the radio.  You're like four minutes ahead of the schedule.  Let's listen to this dummy.  Listen to himself.  Look at this idiot.  How stupid can you...  What a complete ass.  He just hung up.  What an idiot.  I was just on the radio.  Now I'm going to listen to myself.  No, it's a four minute...  Shut up.  I hope you're still listening.  You're a douche.  That's right.  Sweet home...  Where did you pay them?  Pay attention. 
[01:55:00]  Pay attention.  Pay attention.  Where did you pay them?  Where did you pay them?  Sweet home...  What the hell was that?  We've got to get the uncensored version for XM.  It's a chick getting tasered while singing Sweet Home Alabama.  Sweet home...  Where did you pay them?  Pay attention.  Pay attention.  To make the better child of the blue...  Why did they tase her?  I mean, she did suck. 
[01:55:30]  Wow.  Actually, it's on break.com.  It's hilarious.  I was watching that this morning.  Sam and I are on the same page today.  And then it's a montage of people getting tased.  Someone says, Genghis Khan was the movie.  Everyone involved died of cancer, including Agnes Moorhead from Bewitched.  Agnes Moorhead.  She died...  That wasn't a movie, was it?  Genghis Khan?  I thought it was a western. 
[01:56:00]  And, of course, someone says Genghis Khan got glowing reviews.  Very funny nuclear radiation joke.  Agnes Moorhead was her name?  Agnes Moorhead.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to take...  Certainly beats going out with, Agnes, my neck hurts.  Agnes, I'm tired.  Agnes, I don't know you well enough.  Because then she becomes Agnes Black Eye, where Agnes walks home. 
[01:56:30]  Agnes, I'd rather...  That is an awful name to have to go through life with.  It certainly is.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Andre 3000, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I like the Bush thing.  You like the Bush thing?  That was a big story.  Over the weekend?  Over the weekend.  All right.  This is just...  Oh, I don't want to poke fun, though.  Aw.  It's mean-spirited.  Aw, no.  I'm starting to think... 
[01:57:00]  Why?  The older generation just doesn't know what's going on with the Internet.  Well, who brought that up?  Did Dan bring it up?  Who brought it up?  You did?  The separation of the generations?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it has nothing to do with the Internet.  I just assume that old people know what the Internet's all about.  No, they don't.  There is definitely the dividing line between the older generation and the newer generation  is computers.  Older generation?  Not a clue.  They might use them.  They might use them for stuff, the email, things like that, but they really don't know 
[01:57:30]  how they work, what they do.  They use one billionth of a percent of its capacity.  And then there are older people that just, like my mother?  Not a clue.  And we've tried a hundred times to buy her stuff, buy her the easiest computer thing.  Remember web TV?  Even tried that.  Look, it's on your goddamn TV just so we could send you an email or a picture or something.  I don't know.  I don't know.  They're afraid. 
[01:58:00]  They're afraid.  They're afraid.  It's overwhelming when you look at the technology, because when I was in high school in 86,  they were just starting to do like DOS prompt and all that crap and teach you like that  computer lingo.  I don't write into that.  It was like I needed to know how this worked and everything.  But you had a young brain.  Right.  You could soak all that in.  In the old days.  My mother would rather, I tell her all the time, internet movie database, because my mother's  like a movie nut, loves movies.  I go, you just punch in any actor movie. 
[01:58:30]  You could cross-reference, find out when it was made by who this, that.  She goes, no, I have my Leonard Maltin book every year.  She gets this book.  It's two feet tall.  My mom gets that book, too.  It's huge.  And she thumbs through it and goes, what an actor movie.  It takes her a week to find like what she's looking for.  I have my Leonard Maltin book.  Oh, that's terrific.  In two seconds, you could have the answer to what you want.  Leonard Maltin is a creep.  What an ass.  No one likes him.  His big, thick, stupid book. 
[01:59:00]  Exactly.  I'm going to knock her unconscious with that thing one day.  Get a computer, mom.  It's great to get a confession in a South Carolina police station with her.  Right.  Beat your wife around the body with it so the bruises don't show.  The old head and nose palm is straight in her outer.  That's what we also call the Leonard Maltin book.  I'm Leonard Maltin.  I'm Leonard Maltin, and I approve this book.  Another repugnant name.  Well, Bush, this is some scary stuff.  You really think the president would know a little bit more about the Internet. 
[01:59:30]  Now, the president, being an older guy, should be taught this.  Someone should sit him down and smack him in the face and say, look, this is technology of the day.  You need to know this to run this country.  Right.  You need to have a working knowledge of computers and the Internet  in order to really represent the people of this country.  Apparently, he doesn't.  He can handle the power, Zoff.  But when it comes to the power of the Internet... 
[02:00:00]  I hear there's rumors on the Internets.  Not once, but at least twice.  Wait a minute.  Dude.  I got to say, I think he was being silly there.  No, he wasn't.  I don't think so.  Then listen to him be silly two or three times.  But that was the Internets.  No, why?  The Internets.  Because he paused like, uh-oh, how do you say this word?  The Internets.  He's thinking, because he has no concept between the Internet and websites.  So he's thinking the Internets are different sites that you go to. 
[02:00:30]  You know, hey, I'm looking at a few websites here to try to find the answer.  He's thinking the Internets are, each website is an Internet.  And he doesn't really know how to joke.  He doesn't know.  Even when he is joking, it's just so awkward.  But he said it a few times, too.  Internet.  Oh, sorry.  It would be almost like if he paused and said, uh, uh, nuclear.  Or nuclear, whatever the word is.  Nuclear.  Because he can't say that right.  Nuclear.  Like, like, well, I thought it sounded like he was doing a ton-cheek, but maybe I'm wrong.  No, he really doesn't have a clue. 
[02:01:00]  He can handle the powers off when it comes to the power of the Internet.  I hear there's rumors on the, uh, Internets.  Not once, but at least twice, President Bush has inexplicably added an S.  We can, uh, have filters on Internets.  Leading young whippersnappers to mock him.  Everyone's on the Internets.  Yeah.  That's our fearless leader.  Now the leader dubbed Googler-in-chief by the Wall Street Journal has struck again. 
[02:01:30]  During a CNBC interview, the president was asked if he ever Googles.  Occasionally.  And one of the things I've used on the Google is, uh, to pull up maps.  On the Google?  I pull up the maps on the Google.  On the Google.  Here's a guy, he's the President of the United States.  He has Pentagon satellites at his disposal for maps.  And anything he wants.  I pull it up on the Google.  On the Google, on the Internet.  Search on the Internet, a search engine known as the Google. 
[02:02:00]  The Google.  The Google.  When I do the Google.  Sounds like a new dance.  When I'm doing the Google, it's a lot different than the Yahoo.  I'm doing the Google.  And the Google.  The Google.  And he's looking at dumb maps.  Yeah.  I look at, because he was like, what do you, what do you use?  And you could tell, like, he had a thing on his feet there.  It's like, maps.  They've got that, don't they?  Maps are exciting to look at for about 30 seconds.  Where are you driving to that you need to Google a map? 
[02:02:30]  He doesn't have to.  I think he said he likes looking at pictures of his ranch.  Ew.  So it's like, it's where I want to be.  So it goes to Google Earth.  And then I Google, and I say, I think I can see me.  I see my house from here.  Who else does that?  Muhammad Atta was doing that.  Quite a few other people were Googling your ranch.  It was Googling quite a few places around the country.  Right.  Your ranch in particular.  So they'd love to get a hold of that from an aerial view.  The Google.  Sir, they're using the Google. 
[02:03:00]  I like to go to the, what's that one called?  The Cinema Skin.  I like to go to that one.  I like to go to the New Teens.  I use that one every so often for maps.  Maps.  Maps of Hawaii.  Maps of a young, subtle body.  I go to the Google.  I take off the preference filter.  Because if you're having to filter on the images, you're not going to get all the real  dirty, dirty pictures. 
[02:03:30]  Make sure you, when you're on the Google, go to the preferences, and then click off the  filters.  And go to images, and put in nude women.  Go ahead.  Do it right now.  I dare you on the Google.  You'll be Googling when, go to the tub girl.  I love the tub girl.  Just Google my last name.  Just Google my last name, and see how many you got to go through before you get to me  when you take off your filters.  Go ahead.  You're going to see the bush. 
[02:04:00]  How about the horse gag?  Go to the horse gag, the bang bus.  Uh, you could go.  I mean, I went to Bush on there.  I took the preference of, I was, I was pwned.  I was pwned.  I know, I was the pwned.  I know everything about it.  I was playing Counter-Strike, and I was the pwned.  A little more audio.  It's a little bit the way my mom talks about technology.  It's sort of sweet.  Kind of endearing.  She calls to tell you that she got an email. 
[02:04:30]  President Bush said he uses the Google to look at satellite maps of his ranch in Crawford,  Texas.  Reminds me of where I want to be sometimes.  Oh, my God.  What a liar.  You think he just looks at maps of Iraq and makes sound effects?  The door's like, he's like, look, I'm winning.  I don't see any insurgents down there.  Look, I'm zooming in.  I don't see one insurgent on the Google.  The Google, indeed.  Why would you Google your dumb ranch on a laptop when you could just go and say, look, 
[02:05:00]  I would like an aerial photograph taken from space?  Why would you Google a map?  Exactly.  He's got spy planes, satellites, the Pentagon.  He could look at anything.  Hey, I need a picture of my ranch.  Could you get me one at a resolution that's a little better than the Google?  But he's because you know why?  He's lying.  It was it was she she was being a skank, too, by trying to trip him up.  She obviously sensed as a newswoman that he wasn't computer savvy and decided to go in 
[02:05:30]  for the kill and ask him a question.  Do you use Google instead of him going?  No, I really don't.  I, you know, I got people.  Yeah, I'm a little busy to be cruising the internets.  Well, how about no?  Why would I Google when I've had access to all the information that you need to go onto  the web for?  Yeah, I have access to that information.  I have it from the people.  I actually looked on Gary Glitter's computer itself.  All the stuff you're reading on the internets.  We made up anyway.  It's a big grand conspiracy. 
[02:06:00]  You know, that was a cruise missile hit the Pentagon.  Well, I got to go to the Google, the Google when I'm doing the Google.  I love it.  Isn't that great?  But that's it.  He's just he's he's not with it.  He really isn't.  I'm sorry.  And to be a leader in this country, in this day and age, you really got to be computer  savvy.  You know, it's really where a lot of people's ideas are being placed for you to look at. 
[02:06:30]  Maybe he doesn't want to say it.  Maybe.  Maybe.  You know, oh, I hate that damn whack bush.  It's whack bush message board.  Yeah.  You think it's on message boards?  It's called whack bush.  What the hell is that?  Look, they're bashing me.  I'm going to sign up.  I got one post.  You think it's easy running the country?  Angry tapping press.  That's me.  I've been doing the blogging.  I'm blogging.  I'm on the I'm on the MySpace and the YouTube. 
[02:07:00]  Just the image of him like fighting like message board wars.  Listen, you ass.  Right.  Gang.  Not realizing they can look at his IP address and figure out it's him.  It just says the White House.  Well, he's got two different two different names.  He thinks he's being slick.  One is Prez one.  And one is GB second.  Just defending bush, but like not as himself.  He's doing a great job.  Just because he says the Google doesn't mean he doesn't use the Google. 
[02:07:30]  Mock him all you want.  Mock me all you all you want.  Edit, edit, post.  Oh, damn it.  Edit, edit.  Oh, my time ran out.  I can't edit my post no more.  Now it looks like me.  That guy above was this is me.  The president guy above me was not me, but I won't be posting no more.  And one pal talk photo of him just panning down his chest into his lap, waving it at the camera because he doesn't know about screen capping. 
[02:08:00]  Want to go the private?  I'll go the private with you.  Listen, before we take a break, because we got to get up.  We got to take the break.  Well, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  Well, last time I saw a pair of jugs, that big two hillbillies were blowing on them.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Get a wow sticker.  Get flashed.  Get happy.  This is Sports Radio 1140 KSFN.  Got a new driver to insure?  They're all over there. 
[02:08:30]  They're on camera.  They're on camera.  Yeah.  Well, if you want to know why.  Hey, say they're surrounded by amiee.  Then the Po Wire.  Well, if you want...  Yeah.  Now let's go in.  Well, we got a piece of spaghetti and covered.  Now, you know what the assessor is going to be...  Well...  You Sce ambiente, I know what the assessor is. </pre>
