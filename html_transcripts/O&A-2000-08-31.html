<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with Anthony's humorous recounting of his Thanksgiving dinner seating arrangements, attributing his improved position over the years to family deaths. He then discusses his cursing nephews, his mother's drunken "I love you, f*** you" Thanksgiving outbursts, and his own childhood clothing woes, including a fur coat imposed by his mother, resulting in beatings from classmates.  A listener calls in seeking advice on removing a "splooge stain" from a dress.  The conversation shifts to Steve Irwin, with numerous anecdotes about his dangerous animal encounters and resulting injuries.

The show transitions to a prolonged, offensive bit mimicking CBS FM DJs, featuring rapid-fire, sexually suggestive remarks, racial slurs, and homophobic language.  A listener calls to complain about the segment's inappropriateness.  This is followed by a satirical presentation of an O.J. Simpson 911 call and a conversation with guest Laura Korn, who recounts humorous sexual experiences, sparking further raunchy and sexually explicit jokes from the hosts. A Stacker 2 commercial runs throughout.

Continuing with Laura Korn, the hosts discuss her appearance on a daytime TV show, criticizing the female hosts for being “uptight” and censoring her sexually explicit language, including the phrase “bend me over and do me.”  Crude jokes about female television personalities like Star Jones and Barbara Walters follow. Andrew Dice Clay joins the show, escalating the sexually charged banter. A prank phone call requesting “butt plugs” ensues, leading to further sexually explicit discussions and a detailed description of a suggestive passage from Korn's book involving a lit candle and a photograph.  The segment then shifts to listener anecdotes about alleged accidents and cover-ups at Disney World, detailing gruesome injuries and deaths on various rides.  The segment concludes with more sexually explicit and offensive jokes.

The next segment focuses on Opie's reluctant attendance at a *Jekyll & Hyde* Broadway show starring Sebastian Bach.  Listeners call in, expressing disbelief and teasing Opie.  A caller reports even her boyfriend enjoyed the show. The conversation turns vulgar, filled with homophobic and racist slurs, particularly during a discussion about John Rocker. A listener recounts a fan's inappropriate behavior at a Jim Brewer performance. The segment culminates in a bizarre, sexually explicit prank involving a duct-taped, blindfolded "Psycho Mark" and a female caller, Anna (later revealed to be transgender), performing sexually suggestive acts.

The final segment features a prank involving Psycho Mark and Anna, the transgender woman, using pictures from hotshannon.com.  The prank involves increasingly vulgar and sexually suggestive interactions, punctuated by highly offensive language.  The hosts then engage in a fictional, offensive interview with a drunken, debauched, and racist Charlton Heston, filled with racial slurs and graphic sexual descriptions.  A seemingly prank phone call with confusing directions concludes the show, which is consistently filled with extremely offensive and vulgar language throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Only rules, baby!  Yeah, sure.  1-0-7-WNEW  So how was your Thanksgiving, Anthony?  Ah, you know, spent a little time with the family, Opie.  Sure.  Over at Grandma's for the big, you know, Italian Thanksgiving.  Very nice.  All the food that you could feed an army with, and I was right up there.  Right at the, next to the head of the table. 
[00:00:30]  Uh-huh.  I made it all the way up.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Felt pretty good.  My brother wasn't there this year.  He was over at his in-laws.  Ah.  So I got to move up into the Joe seat.  So there I was.  Like, right at the, before the head of the table.  I looked down at the little card table at the end, remembering years and years ago when I was there.  And I had to worry, I remember the middle of the table.  Sure.  I remember when I became a teenager and worked my way up from the card table to the real table, 
[00:01:00]  but way at the card table end.  Well, how many people had to die in your family to get that space?  Oh, quite a few.  Okay.  Quite a few.  And then, you know, I worked my way up, and as I was sitting there next to the head of the table,  thinking there's only one more place to go, you start feeling old.  Old.  Yeah, of course you do.  Old is what you start feeling.  Do you have any teenagers in your family?  Yeah.  So are you like the cool uncle where you, you know, go get them high and stuff in the 
[00:01:30]  coat room?  Oh, no, no.  Give them a little sip or two here or there?  They're like early teens, RJ and Chris.  Oh, all right.  They're pisser.  Cool kids.  Yeah.  Oh, they idolize me.  It's great.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm cursing like a banshee at the table and stuff, and they're just like, you are  so cool.  You were drunk again.  You were drunk again, obviously.  Well, a couple of beers, though.  Not as drunk as my mom.  So you're cool?  My mom was at the point.  She was at the I love you, F you stage.  Really?  Yeah, she gets like that every so often on the holidays. 
[00:02:00]  Was she snotted?  She was drinking her wine.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, sitting there at the table all of a sudden.  And then you bring up the last time we were all hanging out as a family and she was hitting  the wine and she's like, oh, scratch your ass.  I wasn't saying that.  I don't do that because we tell her when she really gets schnockered, she'll say she'll  talk to you and be like, oh, baby, my son, it's so good to see you again.  And you're like, mom, calm down.  I'll at you, at you, at you. 
[00:02:30]  No, but I love you.  I love you.  It's so good to see you again.  All right, mom.  Look, I'm going to go into the kitchen.  I'm going to go, oh, don't leave.  F you, F you.  And it's not F you.  It's the F word.  Well, Coke will do that to you.  Oh, Jesus.  You're saying my mom's doing Coke, Opie?  Well, I'm just assuming at this point.  She's drinking some wine, having a good time with the family.  Could be acid.  Then we tell her that, you know, last time we were all together as a family, you got that  I love you, F you face.  And she's like, oh, no, I wasn't. 
[00:03:00]  Hour later, I love you, F you face.  And then she's bringing up, you know, school.  When I was in school, she goes, remember the time I got you that lovely fur coat?  Fur coat?  Fur coat.  She brought this up.  I forgot about it.  Elementary school.  Did it go with your velour shirt that's on the FM Talk website?  Dude, I don't know what kind of...  You were like a pimp when you were eight years old.  I wish I was as cool as a pimp when I was in that grade.  But it turned out all I was was an elementary school kid going to elementary school in a 
[00:03:30]  fur coat.  My mother's like, oh, it kept you warm.  I go, no, the coat didn't.  The blood running from my nose over my body kept me warm because I'd be beat up.  Because, faggot.  Hey, Anthony, you're a faggot.  Only faggots and women wear fur coats.  I don't know what kind of dope she was doing.  She comes home one day from the store.  I'm just thinking, I want a snorkel jacket like all the other kids had in school. 
[00:04:00]  But, no, my mother said, you know, you ever see on the sidelines of the football games,  Joe Namath wears a fur coat.  Oh, yeah.  Joe Namath wears a fur coat.  Joe Namath was also a quarterback for the Jets at the time.  You know, pretty cool job.  So he could pretty much wear whatever the hell he wanted.  Right, he's not in fifth grade.  People are going to still hang out with him, right.  Exactly.  You know?  Who's that other big, the big black guy that had the daughter in the films, the football player?  He used to crochet on the sidelines.  Greer. 
[00:04:30]  Rosie Greer.  Sure.  He would crochet on the sidelines, right?  Right.  Anybody going to crack him in the head?  Hey, Rosie, you faggot.  Of course not.  If I was to crochet in fifth grade, what would happen to me?  You'd be dead.  The crochet hook would be in my rectum.  Everyone knows that.  You wear a fur coat, it doesn't matter, Joe Namath wears one on the sidelines.  Yeah.  I was being beat up because mom got me a fur coat.  She was always, she was like ahead of the trend and like she was going to make us, we were  models, fashion models. 
[00:05:00]  A fur coat.  Give me my snorkel jacket.  By the time you were in ninth grade, were you dressing like Clyde Frazier?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wanted jeans, I wanted a t-shirt, I wanted sneakers, like I dress now.  So she brought up the fur coat at the Thanksgiving table.  Yeah.  Right.  And I totally forgot about it.  But yeah, she had gotten me a fur coat.  All those, all the little family memories come up in Thanksgiving, things you wish, never  remember again.  But another thing, like sneakers, I always wanted the, what were they, the PF Flyer high 
[00:05:30]  top black sneakers.  Those are the ones I want.  They look like a hoodlum.  If you wear those, you look like a hoodlum.  You want to look like one of those.  And then she'd use the N word and stuff.  Wow, she would?  You know, Italian.  So, you know.  But, hey, come on, she's older now, she goes to church.  She goes to church now, come on.  You know, that was a long time ago.  But I wanted to wear the high top black PF Flyer sneakers. 
[00:06:00]  And my mother would always come back with these, those stupid white skippies, you know.  The stupid sneakers with the rubber front and everything.  Your typical Wonder Years sneakers.  Sure.  You know, and I was pissed.  And pants.  I wanted jeans.  I wanted to go to school in jeans.  She'd get me like dress slacks.  And this is your slacks.  And a dress shirt.  And a tie for the first day of school.  I'm there with a briefcase.  I swear to God.  You would think I was closing deals for IBM the way she dressed me to go up to the fifth grade. 
[00:06:30]  I had a briefcase.  And a shirt, matching shirt and tie.  Which my brother had to wear the exact same thing.  Are we twins?  No.  No.  But she dressed us like we were.  So now everyone thought you were twins.  Right.  And we had to have the same little ties and pants and shoes.  One time in her disco diva phase.  She bought me platform shoes.  Dude. 
[00:07:00]  Platform shoes.  Disco shoes.  I had the big platform shoes.  I swear I had eight inch platform.  I looked like that jerk off in Saturday Night Fever.  Tony, you going to call me Tony?  Tony, give me a call.  She's pregnant, Father.  You think the Pope could get her an abortion, Father?  Tony, you didn't even call me.  Look, Tony, I'm dancing, Tony.  I'm dancing on the bridge, Tony.  I had those big dopey shoes. 
[00:07:30]  That's classic.  And then one time, my sister's dogs, she had two little dogs, ate the shoes.  Yeah, baby.  That was me.  My sister's dog ate the heels of the shoes, the big platform shoes.  I was like, thank you.  Extra can of kennel ration for you.  Back to my skippies.  That's why I dressed like this.  Because for years, I couldn't.  I wanted jeans, sneakers, and a t-shirt my whole friggin' life. 
[00:08:00]  So now, I wear what I want.  And then I go to Thanksgiving dressed the same way.  And my mom's like, you look like a slob.  I go, sorry, I don't have my platform disco shoes and fur coat, Mom.  She could have got the fur coat out of the closet for you.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Look like I'm coming out of the closet with that friggin' thing on.  But her big excuse was, Joe Namath wore a fur coat on the sidelines.  Walking back and forth.  Remember when he was injured a lot of times?  And he had that wacky coat.  Yeah, he was still on the field and stuff.  He walked back and forth the sidelines. 
[00:08:30]  He had this big fur coat.  But he could pull off that look, man.  He had the blondes by his side.  Yeah, two people pulled off that look.  And there were stories in the paper how he's banging broads in between quarters and stuff.  Joe Namath and Fred Mertz.  Remember that when he put the big coat on?  There we go, 23's going to do.  Hey, Apple, let's jitterbug.  I'm going to get some broads with this coat.  Come on, Rick.  He had a big furry bear coat.  That's what I looked like.  So was your childhood idol Joe Namath? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, you know.  Were you wearing pantyhose like him, too?  He did do the commercial for the pantyhose.  No, thank God my mother didn't feel I should be wearing pantyhose.  All right.  Let's go to Cesar.  Cesar, what's going on today?  Anthony, you are a homo, man.  Oh, come on.  Listen, did Mama also buy the little fox skin scarf to match the coat?  No, there was no fox skin scarf.  Yes, there's a little mink scarf.  I bet you.  I'm admitting it was a gay coat.  She put me on a bad gay coat in elementary school where, gee, people aren't judging you 
[00:09:30]  too much by what you look like.  Hey, buddy, I bet she tied the mittens to the sleeve of the coats, too.  No, it wasn't that drastic.  You're a faggot, man.  I had the big dopey, like, galoshes and stuff.  I wanted, like, fireman boots, you know?  Things with the big metal clips.  Sure.  Yeah.  I get the totes, totes galoshes.  Put on your rubbers.  You were obviously poor like myself growing up. 
[00:10:00]  No, she did pretty good, you know?  Well, I know.  I mean, it was all...  No, she was more...  Like, she would spend more to make me look like an asshole.  Now I know why Boomer beat you up in elementary school.  Yeah, exactly.  You had your cute little fur coat on.  My fur coat.  I wanted a bomber jacket, you know?  I wanted regular high-topia flyer sneakers, jeans, just looking like a kid.  But no, my mother figures she's dressing me up like I'm in GQ or something.  GQ?  Well, that's what they would.  They would put stupid things like fur coats on the models and stuff. 
[00:10:30]  And she would see it and go, oh, that's a great look.  She used to dress me up like that.  She was goofing on me because she said over Thanksgiving, she said,  well, when you dress yourself, you look ridiculous.  What do you mean?  And then she pulls out pictures of me with striped pants and a plaid shirt.  I'm walking around like that.  I'm like, so?  That doesn't go.  I'm like, I don't care if it went or not.  That's the 70s look, though.  That's groovy.  That stuff went in the 70s.  Just like Greg Brady.  Haven't you seen the Brady Bunch?  They say it's in. 
[00:11:00]  I remember going for back-to-school shopping and stuff.  You know, you go to the department store and walk around,  and you'd see stuff you want.  You're like, oh, that's good.  That's good.  Oh, no, that's crap.  That's what the lowlifes are wearing.  You know, Charles Nelson Reilly is wearing a scarf off to the right.  You should wear that.  Yeah.  I can't see that.  If there's a picture with you with Charles Nelson Reilly's scarf,  I need to see that.  Where's my scarf?  Oh.  The ghost and Mrs. Muir. 
[00:11:30]  Charles Nelson Reilly.  I'll tell you one thing.  If she would have bought me that coat when I was, like, 13, 14,  I'd have banged it.  Yeah, well, what's with the fur on this coat, Anthony?  Why?  It's like Liberty Spikes at the Punk Rock.  Oh, my God.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You will never see a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. 
[00:12:00]  And we've got to welcome Rick, our producer, back to the show.  He's back.  Rick.  Now a married man.  Yep.  Hold it up high.  Let me see.  Oh.  Hold it up.  There it is.  Wow.  Boy, that is a prominent Rick, isn't it?  Jesus.  There ain't no mistake in that.  I've been tagged.  So when I returned to the wild, she knows exactly where I am.  I was going to say, that looks like a tagging. 
[00:12:30]  This one's been tagged.  Look at him.  I saw that guy this weekend.  Did you?  The crocodile hunter?  God damn, did he make me laugh.  Isn't he funny?  He's really funny.  He, like, doesn't care what the hell he's doing.  Right.  I've seen him stick his head in a cave where there were snakes, and the snakes started biting  his face.  And he's just like, look at these gorgeous creatures.  They're gorgeous.  They're biting my face.  This is gorgeous.  And he's got his wife with him.  Yeah.  She's some American broad. 
[00:13:00]  And they're in the middle of a river, and there's crocodiles in there.  And you see one go by, a big one.  It's like, all right, watch the boat, honey.  And he jumps in.  And he starts, like, grabbing the mouth, and he's talking as he's doing it.  I'm going to try to roll him over before he goes into a death roll.  Death roll?  Because they did, like, a crock will grab onto something, and then roll.  It'll just spin.  And taggle up its tail and everything in there so he can't get free. 
[00:13:30]  And also, whatever it's grabbed onto, it's going to just, it's ripping a chunk out of  it as the crock spins.  Sure.  You know, usually it's some poor dopey wildebeest that went into the river.  Not this dopey Australian guy who's trying to wrestle it on his home turf.  Yeah.  That's the alligator's home turf.  Oh, I've caught him now.  Look at, honey, okay, honey, now jump in.  And he gets his wife in there to sit on the crock's head.  Sit on his head, honey.  I'm going to stick my thumb up his bum.  And see if he's male or female. 
[00:14:00]  Well, this weekend, he was chasing crocodiles.  He was chasing them?  Yeah, there was some form of crocodile.  They moved pretty damn fast and stuff, and he was chasing them.  They were about three, four feet long.  He could run like a mother.  And he's running all over the place, tackling these things.  He doesn't care.  No.  You've seen him with all kinds of animals, and he gets bitten.  He had a kangaroo once, and he was trying to wrestle that thing down.  And the thing's just kicking the crap out of him.  Oh, he's gorgeous. 
[00:14:30]  Look at the color on this.  It's just bleeding and everything.  Yeah.  Bob, what's going on?  You ever notice that he's always wearing those same khaki shorts and T-shirts?  That's all he owns.  That Australian outback kind of wear.  Right, right.  The guy jumps in the ocean, right?  He's going to rescue a shark from a net.  He's wearing the same khaki shorts and T-shirts.  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't change.  No, he doesn't change.  His wife throws in the scuba tank through him, and he's still wearing this.  You see him scuba diving underwater in the shirt. 
[00:15:00]  In his crocodile Dundee outfit.  Right, right.  He's got the boots on over his slippers.  He's some kind of superhero, I think.  I don't know what the hell he is.  Yeah, and then he's diving with those sharks, and he sticks his hand in the hole in the coral  and pulls it out, and it's like totally bloody.  You see him on the boat.  Look, I got my hand.  He seems to have bitten me.  Yeah, no crap.  Look at what you're doing.  You're taunting him.  Guy has no fear whatsoever.  Swimming with crocodiles, going into mud holes.  He ducks underneath the water, underneath the rocks, and pulls out those little crocodiles.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Where the hell did you get that thing from?  Look at him.  Isn't he gorgeous?  All right.  Yeah, and then he's crawling along next to him, right, sticking his face in the thing's  nose.  Oh, he bit me.  He bit my face.  I saw him.  He was holding a snake.  The thing laid right into his nose.  Oh, no.  Don't do this at home.  Don't do it.  Yeah, sure.  I was really just thinking of going out and doing that at home.  Trying to find a snake.  Thank you, Bob.  He was chasing some kind of animals with a Land Rover, and he's on the bumper. 
[00:16:00]  Trying to rope it, and he missed, so he just tells his wife to pull up next to it, and  jumped off the rover onto this thing's head.  It looked like he was being trampled, because he was.  Guy got him, honey.  I've got him.  Like hoof marks in his face.  Look, it's gorgeous.  You think he throws his wife around like that in the bedroom?  Probably.  Look, I'm going to roll her.  She's going into a death row.  Now I'll stick my thumb up a bum. 
[00:16:30]  I'm going to give her what we call the lycus.  Take a U-log over her head.  Jason, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I saw him making excuses for a poisonous snake once for trying to bite him.  Well, I'd be right angry too, mate, if I was in my house trying to get my babies.  And he's coming like two inches from me, snapping away, and him and his wife are trying to catch  these poisonous snakes in like South America, and he's making excuses for them for trying 
[00:17:00]  to bite him.  The guy's such a tool that you've got to watch him.  You've got to love him.  I was laughing so hard.  Crocodile hunt.  Between that and the Giants game, I had a lot of comedy this weekend.  Opie and Anthony.  Wow!  1027 WNEW.  Hello?  Hello?  Who is it?  Hi, my name's Bill, and I have a problem with a stain on a dress.  I'd like to know if you could get a stain out of a dress.  Excuse me, what is it? 
[00:17:30]  I have a stain on a dress that I'd like to know if can be dry cleaned out.  It's a big splooge stain.  You have to bring over showers.  I don't know.  You don't know if you could get a splooge stain out?  What kind of stain?  It's splooge.  It's a big old splooge stain, and it could get me in a lot of trouble.  And I just want to know if you could get that out.  I don't know.  You don't know?  Because the stain out, I don't know.  They have to see it.  Well, I'll let you know.  It's on a black cocktail dress, and it's right on the front, right underneath where the chin would be. 
[00:18:00]  I don't know.  And it's a big old splooge stain.  It's bigger than the...  You don't know.  It kind of dripped out.  I kind of missed it.  It's a big old splooge.  What do you use to get splooge out?  What kind of chemicals best use for splooge?  I heard that commercial, protein gets out protein.  Shouldn't that wash itself out there?  I don't understand what you say.  I don't understand.  It's splooge.  I don't understand.  You know splooge?  I don't understand. 
[00:18:30]  Yankee cranky.  When you're Yankee cranky.  I don't understand too much English.  Okay.  Sorry.  Okay.  When you Yankee the cranky, you...  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is 1027 WNEW. 
[00:19:00]  212-757-1027 if you have anything.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  What's going on?  All right.  Listen, you guys better rip up Bob Shannon up on 101.  Why?  Because he was just ripping you guys up.  I was flipping through the stations while you guys were on break.  Yeah.  And he said that they were in the newspaper that they just cloned them to Monkees.  Because now that you have somebody to take your guys' place, you guys should take a break.  Oh, that's pretty funny.  Everybody talking about the Opie and Anthony Show.  We don't mind.  We don't care.  Keep talking.  All right, guys.  Later. 
[00:19:30]  Thank you.  CBS taking jabs at us?  Yep.  Isn't that the oldies, right?  That's the elephant graveyard.  Yeah.  That's where the old jocks go to die.  Hello, love.  CBS now?  We must be getting popular.  CBS is now taking shots at us.  Donald, what's up?  How could they even do that?  Isn't that just the music station?  Don't they have, like, strict rules?  Who knows?  You know, you're supposed to just seg the songs, shut up, maybe talk about how cold it is out,  and go to the next Shirelle song or something.  You have to go around the corner.  Hey, Donald, what's up? 
[00:20:00]  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I was just listening to CBS.  My uncle had on, he said, uh, that they cloned twin monkeys.  Yeah.  And, uh, he said Opie and Anthony can take a vacation now.  Keep talking about us.  That's pretty funny, though.  I can't believe it.  You guys are great, Ben.  Thank you.  You've got to give him something, because that's a pretty funny line.  It's a funny line, but if you're going to try to, like, get to us, you've got to come  up with something a little bit more than that.  CBS have fun!  Hello!  Hello, love.  Look, they cloned a couple of monkeys. 
[00:20:30]  It looks like Opie and Anthony could be taken to vacation.  Hey, get some CBS music.  We'll do it how they did it.  Probably in between records because they only get, like, 15 seconds to do their shtick, Anthony, you know?  Yeah, let's see if we can talk it up like they do over there.  I wish we had the echo.  We need the massive echo chamber.  Oh, where it sounds like you're, like, playing basketball in the gym and doing a radio show at the same time?  Yeah, you're on a basketball court, it sounds like.  All right.  Wow.  Hello, love.  We don't have that, though.  I don't know why they do that.  God, we must be pissing off just everybody in this business. 
[00:21:00]  Well, our pals at the radio message board, the industry little dumping ground for all the people all weekend long.  And today, once again, we're just the popular post.

Hey, Harry Balls here, CBS FM.  You know, I'm reading they cloned a couple of monkeys and the music's coming in now.  Hey, girl.  We don't have enough time.  Okay, I got one.  We got one?

[00:22:00]  Looks like Opie and Anthony are going to be able to take a vacation.  The Hollies, blonde, cold woman in a black dress.  This one taking you right back to September 1972.  Yeah, that's not bad, man.  Bravo.  Didn't have any more to babble.  All right, well, you want to do, like, a little, uh, weather break?  Do a quick, quick weather break.

You gotta do everything you've ever wanted to say in your life in, like, three seconds.  Well, bitch, you couldn't be down.  You don't even get a chance there.  Oh, that one, you know.  Here, try this one.  Hey, everybody.  Harry Sack with ya on CBS FM.  You know, they cloned a couple of monkeys, and I can't talk about it because the music started.  I wish I was over at Eddie W.

[00:27:30]  Well, it's a tricky job.  I keep stepping on the words because I'm diddling myself.  C-B-F.  That's some gig they got over there, though.  But if all you had to do was, like, during the music, plan out what you're going to say over the...  And listen to the beginning of the song 20 times.  Yeah.  Hey, the Osmond brothers.

[00:35:00]  You think this is really funny?  Yes.  All right.  Caller Frank, you're on the air.  This is really...  I've been listening to me.  It's a guy, Justin Sider.  I don't think it's funny.  You know, CBS FM is a station that's responsible for bringing rock and roll to this city.  Ho-ho, Frank.  Looks like Hitler missed a few.  CBS.  It's not funny, man.  It's just not funny.  It's not funny.  You're saying it's not funny.  It's not funny.  It's not right, man.  It's just not right.  Is my echo coming through?  Because that's all that matters.

[00:35:30]  All right, Frank.  What's the beef with that on the station?  I don't understand it.  I don't understand it.  Why are you mocking on CBS FM?  And dedicated to him will play Just a Little Understanding.  Taking it right back to 1962, Frank.  We understand you.  We're listening here at CBS FM.  What is the purpose of the echo at CBS FM?  CBS.  It's to help enhance my voice so you can't tell them 101. 
[00:36:00]  Just like our frequency.  101 CBS FM.  God damn.  Ron Lubbock, CBS FM.  How you doing, people?  This one's going to bring back some memories of those black exploitation films.  What is this?

[00:44:00]  This is 1027 WNEW.  This is New York.  We can talk about O.J. real fast.  Yeah, O.J. back in the news, huh?  With a 911 call.  Let's check out the 911 call.  All right.  Hey, Harry.  Police and fire.  Where's your emergency?  We have a problem here.  I'm trying to get a girl to go to rehab.  We've been doing drugs with Pedro Corrado.  Yes.  Does anybody there need rescue?  We've been doing drugs for two days with Pedro Corrado, who just got arrested. 
[00:44:30]  It's like cocaine, and I'm trying to get her to leave her out and go into rehab right now.  Is anybody hitting anyone right now?  No, no, no.  Does anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no.  Does the girl be in drugs?  No.  That's my favorite.  Anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Not this time.  Not this time.  She had to ask if anyone was getting hit or hurt or if he has weapons.  Does the woman have another mouth under her mouth now that's really bloody? 
[00:45:00]  No, no, not this time.  I've got to hear that again.  That's it.  Okay.  My cocaine, and I'm trying to get her to leave her out and go into rehab right now.  Is anybody hitting anyone right now?  No, no, no.  Is anybody hitting anyone right now?  Does anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no.  Does the girl need a rescue?  No, she doesn't need a rescue.  All right.  I thought I was running out for her.  You're trying to tell me.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Now, don't get started on that again.  No, no.  No weapons.  That's in the golf bag.  I mean, I don't know where the knife is. 
[00:45:30]  That's in a lake in Chicago.  Don't make me get on a plane.  Oh, I cut my knuckle on the nine when I was dialing 911.  That's where the blood's from.  I swear.  Where's Robert Kardashian?  Help me, please.  He's like, no.  I want to tell.  No, no, no.  Don't think that.  No, no.  Is anyone hurt need a rescue?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I love it.  Don't make me get in a Bronco.  Now, what does he do? 
[00:46:00]  Does he call 911 back?  Oh, no.  911 calls his home, I believe.  I guess they were disconnected or something, and then 911 usually calls back.  Okay.  So, here's the second half.  Hello, OJ House.  For police?  I want you to call the police.  Hello?  Okay.  This is the deuce.  Now, what happened?  I don't know.  You hear OJ going, I want you to call the police.  I had to hit her over the head with the phone receiver, and we were disconnected. 
[00:46:30]  I like them.  Hello?  This is the police department.  So, she left, and I don't know what to do about it.  This guy, Pedro Guerrero, got arrested for having 15 keys of cocaine.  This girl has spent the last two days doing drugs with him.  Me and a friend just came over and said, you're going into a rehab.  She got mad.  She just got her car.  She drives a Mercedes.  She lives in the crossings.  Now, it's loaded out of her mind. 
[00:47:00]  Get her Mustang driving around town.  She drives a license number, but she needs to be stopped.  What color is a Mustang?  It's white.  Like a Bronco.  Is she black or white?  She's a white girl.  Okay, thank you.  I got to go and see if I can find her.  Okay.  All right.  That's all I did, a white girl.  This has got to be a comedy routine.  I believe Al Cowling's driving.  OJ calls 911.  Is OJ putting out a prank call tape? 
[00:47:30]  Is that what's going on here?  The best of OJ.  I call 911 around the country.  Get my 911 comedy tape.  OJ calls 911.  Hello, 911?  911 operator.  Is your refrigerator running now?  Yes, it is.  Well, you better catch it.  911?  911, what's your emergency?  Hello, do you have Prince Albert in a can? 
[00:48:00]  What do you mean?  Do you have Prince Albert in a can?  Yes, we do.  Well, you better let him out before he suffocates.  That's the OJ Simpson 911 comedy tape.  All of yours now.  He's a big one.  Hello, is this 911?  Yes.  Do you have 10-pound balls? 
[00:48:30]  Yes, we do.  How do you walk?  You'll skip a bit of OJ Simpson.  I got to go now.  I got to find her.  He's all concerned.  Man, is he bored, huh?  Oh, man.  I was hoping he would do the famous butt plug, I'll try to call it.  Hello, 911?  Yes.  I'm looking for Michael Hunt. 
[00:49:00]  Is he there?  He goes by the name of Mike.  Laugh along with your favorite murderer, OJ.  Number one?  Yes?  Uh, butt plug.  Bug box?  Butt plug.  What are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Don't make me cut your throat, mother... 
[00:49:30]  Does OJ do any, like, character voices on his prank call tape?  Kind of like the jerky voices?  I'll come down there with my tool box.  I'll bash your head in with a ratchet.  Or a knife.  I'm OJ.  Oops, I just cut myself on a piece of foam rubber.  I better fly to Chicago. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, man.  That's the OJ Simpson 911 comedy tape.  Order yours now.  Friggin' OJ, man.  He's back.  I love him.  Thank God.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Hello, Lamb Chop.  I'm free.  I'm free at last.  Freak at last.

Thank God.  Why do you sound so bitter?  She gave you your break in showbiz.  You'd be bitter, too, if you were to hand up your ass for 20 years.  She wouldn't even take me off when she went to the bathroom, if you catch my drift.  Ah, come on.  Oh, and then she thought it was cute calling me f***ing Lamb Chop.  That's like calling a cow meatloaf, sadistic bitch. 
[00:51:00]  I was the whole act, and she knew it.  We hated each other.  She sucked.  Oh, she's real creative.  I've been listening to that s*** for 20 years.  Creative.  I'm a f***ing suck.  Good thing she didn't have a condom in her hand when she talked me up.  Things would look a little different.  Hey, her f***ing lips moved when she talked.  What kind of crap is that?  It's a book to be a ventriloquist, and your mouth is moving like Monica Lewinsky's. 
[00:51:30]  I'm a 45-cent sock from Woolworths that she made a f***ing fortune off of, and I didn't get d***.  Lamb Chop, what's in your future?  I'm going to be in a couple of new films.  Yeah?  That Lamb Chop sucks a big d***.  And shove your fist in my hand.  And my career's flying, that f***ing bitch.  All right, Lamb Chop, I better let you go mourn some more. 
[00:52:00]  All right, bye-bye, kids, bye.  All right, it's Lamb Chop, everyone.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  Now you're going to hear this on Z100.

[00:54:00]  What is, by the way, the most retarded thing that's ever happened to you while you're having sex?  Well, we talk about retard sex.  Anthony has retard sex with his lovely wife.  Yeah.  You got to retard sex.  Can you do, like, an instant replay right now?  I have retard sex.  Everybody has retard sex.  They do.  We do.  It's just because you always...  You're moving all screwed up and everything.  Get your leg over here, your arm. 
[00:54:30]  You're on my hair.  Yeah.  They're on my hair.  Ah, boy, this is good.  You can look, but you better not touch.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I don't know if we can take that.  I don't know if I can take that for a couple hours.  Oh, my God, guys.  Okay.  Don't make me laugh.  Those deep belly laughs.  I said, that only comes out when it goes deep.  Ah, there you go. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, brother.  Now, do I have kind of like an afterglow going on right now?  Why?  Did you get some?  Yeah, I just had some hotel sex.  You did?  Oh, it's awesome.  Wait, can I explain to people...  It's really cool.  Laura looks like Barbara Eden.  Yeah?  Yes, master.  Ooh.  And you just had hotel sex.  I just had hotel sex.  Bell boy.  Bell boy.  Can I grab your bag?  Well, who'd you have sex with?  I don't know. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, okay.  Room service.  Room service.  Use a tomb space.  No, I'm with my guy.  Oh.  Actually, I did.  It was really funny.  And I hadn't done this page for a while.  I actually did a page from the 52 Invitations called Heels and Squeals.  Heels and Squeals.  And here's what I did.  I put some heels on, and I tied them to the chair.  And then I teased him until he squealed.  Oh.  Whoa.  Yes.  Heels and Squeals.  You know, look at her. 
[00:56:00]  She does have an afterglow, doesn't she?  I do.  You know...  It was good.  It was great sex.  It was cool.  Wow.  You should have taken a shower after your sex.  You got one of those, like, chocolate mints in your head.  A pillow mints stuck to the back of your head.  Oh, my word.  Oh, I'm telling you, there's no one funnier than you guys.  There's no one funnier than you guys on radio.  Wow.  More kissing at the end.  I have been looking forward to this for so long.  You have no idea.  I think the ladies at The View are funnier than us.  Oh, my God.  Laura, we saw... 
[00:56:30]  I turn on The View.  Oh, no.  Which performance?  And I see Laura on The View.  Talking about how to turn a good girl bad?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they kept, like, cutting you off.  I know.  I know.  The second you start getting into being Laura Korn and being fun and sexual, and they're  like, you know, Star Jones going, hey, calm down there, honey.  You calm down there, honey.  We got people watching you don't want to know nothing about that there, honey.  I know I'm a diva.  Diva?  She's a diesel. 
[00:57:00]  Never mind a diva.  But I wanted to see Laura Korn be Laura Korn.  She's, like, losing it.  And they wouldn't let her be her.  You said something, and they just, like, nearly...  Their jaws dropped.  You said something.  I think you used the word vagina or something.  No, no, no, no.  Actually, I said, you know, they were asking me about sex.  I said, guys really like, you know, spontaneous, you know, kind of... 
[00:57:30]  Oh, right.  I think I said, bend me over.  Yeah.  Bend me over and do me.  Not exactly ready for, you know, daytime TV.  Yeah, bend me over the table and do me.  Honey, I don't want to hear that.  First of all, you can't bend me over.  And second of all, they know your table's strong enough to hold the big, fat Star Jones belly.  Why does Star Jones now sound like the river now?  No justice, no peace.  Careful, you almost got the mic caught in your mouth. 
[00:58:00]  I've got to defend the girls here for a second.  Oh, okay.  Come on, guys.  No, they aren't...  What?  What?  No, it's a great show for guys.  Oh, my God.  It's torturous.  We don't get that chat fest.  What were you guys doing watching the show if you don't like the view?  So we could get material for our show.  I heard Laura Korn.  Anthony has to work on the Star Jones impression anyway.  Right.  You heard...  I heard Laura Korn was on, so I tuned it in.  Oh, that is so cool.  And when I tuned it in, I wanted to see Laura, and I saw a Laura being cut short by girls 
[00:58:30]  that seemed a little uptight.  I will tell you.  You know what?  They're all great girls.  I really will say that.  They've been really helpful in selling a lot of books for me.  I really like them.  I think what the problem was is it's very difficult if you're going to go on the show and talk  about a book to talk to four women at the same time.  That was what the problem was.  And I started thinking about it afterwards because, you know, now I've got two people,  but you've got four women trying to get in a word edgewise.  Nothing happens.  Yeah.  And that's kind of what happened.  But I really do like those girls. 
[00:59:00]  I really do.  I think they're all neat.  I understand the problem.  You've got the four broads.  You're trying to talk to them.  They're talking back.  The trick is, you know what you do, honey?  You've got to fill their mouths up with something.  You shut up three of them.  Then you can talk to the fourth one until she pisses you off.  Then wham, you flick that one's mouth.  And then you talk with the other one.  Oh, so how is your sex book there, Laura?  Don't talk about it, though. 
[00:59:30]  It's a very touchy situation.  Hey, come here, honey.  Yeah, look at it here.  I shut you up.  Now I'll talk to the fat one over here.  Come here.  I'd rather talk to your ass.  Here, turn around.  I'm on your good side.  I'm going to talk to your ass now.  All right, honey?  Barbara, look at her over here.  Methuselah.  Gee, how old is this broad, huh?  How old is Barbara?  She's wearing a little, uh, trying to be a sexy bippy number. 
[01:00:00]  It looked like two sweat socks full of sand hanging off her chest, for God's sake.  Barbara, the days are over.  The days you're dreaming of banging Geraldo, they're over.  That was in the past.  Then they got rid of that Debbie Mantatopoulos, the Greek broad, who probably likes it from  behind.  Because you know how the Greeks are.  The only good one in the bunch, the blonde, that would bite the pillow. 
[01:00:30]  And they toss her out.  But then they got the egg full young broad in there now, so that's kind of hot.  I hear they got ones that are sideways.  I'll ring your gong, honey.  Wow, the Dice coming in out of nowhere.  I had no idea he was going to hang with us today.  Thank you, the Dice man.  I think, I guess whenever a sexual topic comes up, Dice likes commenting.  I apologize if anybody was offended by Dice's remarks. 
[01:01:00]  We try to keep him out of the stadium.  We can't control him right after that.  Look, he's out there now talking to the Greaseman.  I wonder what they're talking about.  Oh, God.  All right, Lauren.  So you didn't see the show when Barbara interviewed me.  No, I missed that one.  That was a great show.  Was it?  Oh, yeah, because, you know, and Barbara, it was really surprising because she, she, when  I started talking about the famous page, The Velvet Tongue, she turns to the camera  and says, I know all about The Velvet Tongue.  No.  Oh.  I know about The Velvet Tongue.  Hey, Barbara, let me give you a little hint, Babs. 
[01:01:30]  Before you start using your tongue for sex, try talking right with it.  That's what it's there for.  Speech.  Get that one down and then move on to The Velvet Tongue.  Ugh.  Ew, I didn't, I didn't need that visual.  Wow.  No, but it was kind of, I think it was surprised everybody on the set.  Yeah.  Here's Barbara, you know, Walter's talking about.  You never think of her going Hugh Downs on anybody.  I bet you.  No, you don't want to know something.  See, now I think.  That's wacky. 
[01:02:00]  I bet Barbara in her heyday was, you know.  Quite a goer, yeah.  Yeah, I think her head hit the headboard.  Whoa.  I think she was kind of well with it.  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if she's still wild.  I don't even want to picture that one, man.  No, thank you.  And Star Jones.  No, stop.  Oh.  What, she's a very sexual being?  I think she is.  Yeah?  Yeah, I know you don't want to think of sex, but, I mean, she is.  I want to think of sex, but not with that. 
[01:02:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's somewhere I don't want to go.  We had a couple of beautiful African women in here yesterday.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  My God.  Were they really?  What were they talking about?  Who knows?  You don't even know.  Who cares?  Who cares what's coming out of their mouth?  And what cares is what's going in, huh?  You understand?  They didn't speak English.  Yeah.  Through most of the show.  Uh-huh.  Were you just trying to interpret what they were saying? 
[01:03:00]  Well, I understood, because they were trying to grab my stuff.  Yeah.  Really?  She was.  Really?  And now my chick is pissed.  Yeah.  Is she really?  She heard the show yesterday and heard this girl trying to grab Opie's thingy.  Well, at one point, what did she say?  I want to tash it.  I want to tash it.  And she kept grabbing.  Right.  Like, I want to tash it.  Did you have a woody?  No.  It's hung like an acorn.  That's funny.  He was trying to fight her off. 
[01:03:30]  It was so funny.  He had the chair.  He was sitting with the back of the chair in the front, like, guarding his region.  And the girl's like, I want to tash it.  I want to tash it.  And she's grabbing all around.  Great.  You would think he had a green card down his pants.  I want to tash it.  I want to tash it.  I want to tash it.  Hey.  Opie.  Keep your hands.  Don't waste me a pant.  Ah.  Too late for me.  And Anthony.  I'm just a claim and bag.  More stupidity on the way.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[01:04:00]  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  And it's our pal, Laura Korn, everyone.  Laura.  People are getting sick of your laugh, Laura.  But that's okay.  I know.  I was apologizing about it.  I mean, it's just.  We warned our listeners this time, though.  Because last time, it caught them off guard.  And they were driving off the road and stuff.  I like the way one guy described her laugh on the instant feedback.  It goes, love, Laura Korn, but I hate her laugh.  It sounds like Opie's jumping on her chest.  I wish.  I wish.  Whoa. 
[01:04:30]  Look at that.  We have a love connection.  Can you put the Barbie Eden outfit on for me?  Hey, I've got to say hi to my brother-in-law, Fish.  Fish?  Fish?  Who fouls my sister.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Is that necessary?  Fouling?  I think maybe she might have a different opinion of what that is to her.  They make love, Anthony.  Right.  They have a little one now, J.D.  They have a lovely little family. 
[01:05:00]  I shouldn't have said fouled.  I'm sorry.  Fouled?  My sister's going to kill me.  Jiminy Cricket.  I thought I was in radio mode and just realized that I was abusing my sister.  That's just not a good thing.  Anyway, Fish and Green Lawn.  Hey, Opie, we are playing our opening softball games tonight for my work team.  Guess the name of their team?  The Accurate Balloon Nuts.  Why is it accurate?  The Accurate Balloon Nuts?  I don't get the accurate part, but their team is called the Accurate Balloon Nuts.  Maybe there was already a team called the Balloon Nuts. 
[01:05:30]  Right.  All right, Laura, you've been asking us questions.  We want to ask you one.  Okay.  What is a balloon nut?  Okay.  Is it anything like the Blue Balloon?  No, this is a part of a body.  Part of the body.  What is the balloon nut?  The balloon nut.  Yes.  Oh, I thought you were saying nut.  No.  No, that's a problem.  We're going to have that taken care of.  The balloon nut. 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  Very tough question.  We refer to it a lot here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Would that be a very well hung?  No.  No.  No.  You're thinking of the balloon itself.  Maybe you're thinking one of the long ones that the kid party guy makes the animals out.  That's what I'm thinking.  We're just thinking about the balloon nut itself.  I love when they finally catch on.  Yeah.  Here it comes.  Look at her.  She'll know any second now.  You ever look at a balloon nut?  Yeah.  You ever open up the end of a balloon after it's tied in a knot and look at it? 
[01:06:30]  You ever see that?  Looks just like a balloon nut.  Come on.  You blow up a balloon.  You tie it in a knot.  It's like.  All right.  And then you look at the end you just blew into.  You got it.  When it's now tied in a knot.  And it looks just like.  Looks familiar.  Right.  When's the last time you were standing over a mirror?  Well, I have a virgin one.  Well, good for you. 
[01:07:00]  So do I.  So do I.  Proud to say.  We're in the same club in this room.  Did you ever have to fend anyone off?  Yeah, but you know what?  I did do something kind of wild with it.  Can I say this?  Wait a minute.  Let me get.  I've got to write it.  All right.  Okay.  I can't even believe I'm going to say this on the air.  Wait a minute.  Are we going to all of a sudden have a new opinion of yours?  She needs a pen.  Oh, you know, I made Playboy this month.  Really?  Give me a pen.  Yeah.  I don't have one.  They don't give me sharp.  We'll just play the turn off the mic game again.  Okay.  Turn off the mic.  All right.  Test it off on.  Okay. 
[01:07:30]  Oh.  You can say that.  You can say that.  You can say butt plug.  Oh, you can.  Okay.  Yeah.  You ever hear our butt plug prank?  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you've got to get it.  It's kind of fun.  Okay.  It's kind of fun.  You tried that, huh?  I did.  How big?  Like a finger.  Small one, huh?  Yeah, like a small one.  Yeah.  And, uh, what made you, what made you, uh, say, hey, I need a, I need a, oh, so that's  like a tax write-off for you, too.  You can write that off.  I can see her at her accountant. 
[01:08:00]  Okay, Laura.  Butt plugs.  How many?  Cost?  It's a deduction.  You could take that.  All right.  Listen.  I took like 130 million porno movies off on my back.  Look at that.  That rocks.  And we just have to eat that expense.  All right.  Here's the butt plug prank call, Laura.  Okay.  May I help you?  Yes, uh, butt plugs.  Who?  Butt plugs, please.  Butt plugs, yes, ma'am.  How can I help you?  Uh, butt plugs.  What is it? 
[01:08:30]  Butt plugs.  A what box?  Uh, butt plugs.  A butt box?  Butt plugs.  I'm not following what you're saying.  Butt plugs.  I have a bad connection.  I don't understand.  What is it?  Uh, butt plugs.  Butt, butt plugs?  Is it like a receptacle you're talking about?  Butt plugs, yeah.  What kind of plug is it?  A spark plug you're talking about?  Butt plugs.  Oh, hold on.  Hello.  Uh, what are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Spark plug.  What kind?  Butt plug.  What kind of a spark plug?  Uh, no.  Butt plug. 
[01:09:00]  I, I, I just don't understand you, sir.  I'm sorry.  Uh, butt plug?  A spark plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug?  Butt plug.  Never heard of it.  What do you use it for?  Butt plug.  Huh?  Butt plug.  What do you use it for, sir?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Yeah.  Butt lug?  Butt plug.  I know, butt.  But what do you use it on?  What do you use it in?  I'm trying to figure...  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Yeah, okay.  I got you a spark plug.  There's all kinds of spark plugs. 
[01:09:30]  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt?  Butt plug.  Sorry, sir.  We don't understand what you want.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  I don't know.  We don't carry that.  Butt plug?  Yeah.  We don't carry it.  Thank you.  All right.  We love that one.  Where was that?  Was that here in New York?  Well, okay, whatever. 
[01:10:00]  You can't say.  No, you can't say where we called.  Oh, God.  Because then they'll try to sue us like everyone else.  Yeah.  Have you ever been curious about it?  I had never...  I had to do research.  Butt plugs?  Yes.  No.  Okay.  There's no...  See, okay, off camera, I'll give you a little pantomime of the seduction, okay?  All right.  Oh.  Jeez, Laura.  Butt plug.  No, you know what it is?  No, that's called three-way girl.  Picture trying to drive your vehicle, right? 
[01:10:30]  Jump over the center divider by the Midtown Tunnel and take the outbound tube into Manhattan  That would be easier than me using a butt plug.  You'd have more success during rush hour, did I mention?  Now, what's with that area where a lot of people fantasize?  Fantasize?  Because I'm mostly...  I'm not fantasizing about that.  You mean as far as, like, a guy to a lady?  Yeah.  Because it's like the forbidden zone, man.  Damn, the forbidden zone! 
[01:11:00]  Dr. Zayas told me never to go to the forbidden zone!  It's a big red monkey ass.  Damn you.  I was told to stay away from the forbidden zone, for it was still infected with radiation  from the great explosions.  But I went.  I went to the forbidden zone and saw the horrors.  I should have listened to Cornelius and Zira.  But no!  Damn me!  I saw the red monkey ass in the forbidden zone! 
[01:11:30]  We all love the forbidden zone, us men.  Nothing beats like...  When I had Nova on my horse...  Nova.  Yes.  And my horse.  I visited my horse's forbidden zone.  That's why I wore the loincloth.  My horse identified the sound of my fly going down and ran off.  So I had to wear the loincloth. 
[01:12:00]  I looked sexy in that, didn't I?  The props department for Planet of the Apes let me keep the loincloth.  Now I wear it on my head!  I have my loincloth wig on my head!  Damn me!  Damn.  Yes, we're all...  We're all drawn to the forbidden zone, Laura.  How's your forbidden zone?  Tight.  Tight, yes.  It was very hard to get to, even on horseback.  Dr. Zayas told me, stay away. 
[01:12:30]  I couldn't stay away!  Damn me, the hell!  All right, Chuck, get out of here.  Wow, Charlton Heston, everyone.  Who knew?  I guess when you're talking about the forbidden zone,  Charlton Heston has to come in and make an appearance.  Guy never knows when to shut up.  You're like Sybil.  He burns on that.  What?  Hello, New Yorkers.  You've been hearing a lot lately about Opie and Anthony.  They're setting new standards in New York radio. 
[01:13:00]  Opie and Anthony.  They're mature.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're educational.  Johnny's starting to grow hair in places he didn't have it before.  And they reinforce family values.  Son, you coming down?  No, I'm not.  Not if you're going to start talking about mom's boobs.  Opie and Anthony.  Heard afternoons on this fine station.  N-E-W.  Opie and Anthony and Laura Korn is here looking to order one of her books. 
[01:13:30]  It's 1-800-611-B-O-N-K.  I think John from Jersey has the answer to the question.  Why don't you give the question?  Okay.  There's a seduction.  Are you laughing?  Is it on the...  Yes.  I think he's got it.  Okay, here's a question.  There's a page in the new book, 52 Invitations to Great Sex.  It's called Invitation to Sin.  It's a for his eyes only page.  He sends her this invitation in the mail.  The invitation asks her to bring a kitchen chair into the bedroom. 
[01:14:00]  She comes into the bedroom with a kitchen chair.  She sits in the kitchen chair.  You're doing something.  And you light a...  The candle's lit.  You blow out the candle.  Then you relight the candle.  At that very moment, she sees you do something that's going to blow her away.  What is it?  Did you read that?  No, I haven't read it yet.  He says the only thing he can think of is to blow a rip-ass fart by the flame and cause a fireball. 
[01:14:30]  Right at her.  That'll wake her up.  All right, honey.  Here it goes.  That'll blow her away.  Thanks, John.  You got me crying over here.  I'm laughing so hard.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, bud?  You were saying something about it buzzing.  So is it like a pocket rocket involved in it? 
[01:15:00]  A pocket rocket?  Yeah.  What are you doing with it?  Oh, gosh.  I can't even...  What about on the guy?  Yeah.  I mean, okay, you've got something...  You've got yourself in one hand.  Uh-huh.  Mr. Friendly.  Yeah.  And then you got something in the other hand.  Oh, no.  We're not going back to the forbidden zone, are we?  No.  No, we're not.  No.  No.  We're not going to the forbidden zone.  Return to the planet of the age.  All right. 
[01:15:30]  Okay, so...  No.  So you think it's...  You have a pocket rocket, which is a vibrator in your other hand.  Yeah.  And you're doing yourself.  No, her.  How could she?  She's sitting in the chair.  You can't even touch her.  Yeah.  She's sitting in a chair far from the bed.  You're on the bed.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Something else is in your other hand.  Well, is the pocket rocket in?  Yeah.  No.  Oh, so that has nothing to do with a vibrator.  No, no, no, it doesn't.  All right, dude.  We've got to move on, all right?  All right.  Sorry about that.  Okay, bye.  Bob, I believe.  What's up?  Yeah.  Hey, Bob.  How you doing? 
[01:16:00]  All right.  How you doing?  All right.  Well, the first thing I want to say is I don't think a woman looks the most beautiful  after you make love.  I think it's just before the point of impact, if you know what I mean.  They all look like Cindy Crawford about two seconds.  You know what I think...  And then look like Broomhilda just right after your daughter.  Right after you're done.  Did I drink that much beer?  Damn.  Well, you know, I got up and put a little lipstick on and everything, but I think there's an afterglow. 
[01:16:30]  And I mean, I really do.  Okay.  I was kind of, you know, going towards this other gentleman's thing.  You had the pocket rock in your other hand.  You're just about to insert it.  No, no.  Careful.  Okay.  I said insert it.  Okay.  Either that or surprise her with a package as the candle goes back on.  Something in your other hand.  Well, you got something in your other hand.  The obvious thing is a lighter.  I had to light the damn candle.  Okay.  You light the candle and the other thing is still in your other hand. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  And you present her with a present.  Yeah.  That's finishing with the other hand.  How can you say that on the air without getting thrown off the air?  No, you can't, you know.  You finish the act, let's say, as the candle comes on.  Oh, and you have the results.  Yes.  In your other hand.  There you go.  The results are in.  Well, the results are in her lap.  As I read these off. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, there you go.  Are we off?  No, you're totally off.  Okay, I'll give you a hint.  A hint.  Okay?  This will give her incredible confidence.  Ah.  Now, you've got to know what this is now.  Now, this is just the beginning of the seduction.  Ah-ha.  It will give her incredible confidence.  I mean, it's, yeah.  Do you have a bottle of stack or two in the other hand?  A roll of 50s in the other hand?  Your American Express card. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  All right, Bob.  All right, Bob.  No, that's not it.  But have a good one.  Thanks, Bob.  All right, thanks for calling.  All right, Bob's funny.  Hey, Joe.  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Laughing my butt off today, man.  You guys are great.  Lori, you're the best.  Oh, thanks.  Okay, so what do you think you're doing?  Well, if I had Johnny Happy in one hand,  I think I'd have the candle in the other hand.  No, the candle's, you know, just sitting there.  You relit the candle.  It's on the nightstand.  See, I thought you were going for the wax.  Oh. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  This will give her incredible confidence.  Confidence.  I got it.  I mean, it's just a...  When you went to the confidence, I'm thinking now handcuffs, but...  It's the...  I mean, this is the kind of thing that will invade her dreams.  I mean, this is very erotic.  Oh, man.  I know, when I did the hot wax thing, and that kind of went, you know?  Well, do you have an answer, man?  It kind of went like what?  Was it good?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know, you can drip hot wax in, like, certain areas of the body  and really, ooh, send shivers to places.  Stomp your sign, I'll knock it off. 
[01:19:00]  Hey, stomp your sign, I'll knock it off.  Uh-oh.  He's getting mad now.  I think we need a lady to answer this question at this point.  No, man.  Okay.  I'm going to say handcuffs, then.  Hey, you know what?  I'll send you a copy of my book anyway.  Cool.  All right.  Hold on the line, buddy.  Tremendous confidence.  Tremendous confidence.  I got it.  Okay, you got it?  Lou.  Yeah.  You got the answer?  I thought I did.  I was going with the wax thing myself.  Wait, Anthony?  Yeah, yeah.  Anthony's got it.  Anthony's got the answer?  What do you think?  Come on, come on.  What do you think?  You don't want to give it away now? 
[01:19:30]  No, I won't.  I won't give it away.  I'll wait.  Okay.  I was, okay, I'll give it away.  Her best friend's head.  No.  Teasing, of course.  What's the answer?  He got it.  You don't know?  Her picture.  More pictures?  So you're...  You're...  Not Playboy.  Flogging it.  Not Playboy.  Not Penthouse.  Not her picture.  All right? 
[01:20:00]  So every woman thinks you guys are, like, in the bathroom, you know, like...  Oh, wow.  Right?  Yeah.  That's kind of cool.  Right.  That'll build her confidence, especially when it's her sixth grade class shot.  Yeah, honey.  Look, it's you.  Before the boobies.  Yeah, you were a dirty girl, weren't you?  All right.  And here you are with Dad.  Yeah, this one really gets me hot. 
[01:20:30]  All right, hon.  Here's where you took that class trip to Museum of Natural History with your teacher.  Yeah.  Look at me go.  This one makes me hot, toots.  Here you are.  Look at you, the way you're laying in that stroller taunting me.  You're taunting me.  You're a tease in that pamper.  I can't breathe.  But it's you, honey.  Why are you packing your bags and running? 
[01:21:00]  I can't breathe.  A picture of her.  What's really funny is in the seduction, I say you have all her pictures all over the mattress.  Here's you in church, making communion.  But it's you, honey.  Yeah.  Look at you.  Seven years old with your new Barbie doll. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, wow.  I'm ready to pop now.  Holy cow.  Yeah.  Look at you in your communion dress.  Oh, God.  I say it.  That's pictures of her.  That's top shelf stuff right there, Andy.  Makes sense, though.  I understand.  And it would give her confidence that you're getting so aroused from her.  But that's not all to the seduction, but that is just the start of it.  So if people are tuning in, all right, she's in the chair. 
[01:22:00]  You're on the bed.  There's a candle.  You're waxing the carrot at this point.  Okay, you turn off the, you blow out the candle.  You wait how long?  A couple minutes?  Yeah.  A couple minutes.  You turn the, you light the candle again, and you're still waxing the carrot, and you're  holding her picture.  Right.  What happens?  Imagine if you lose it during that time, though.  It's like, yeah, no, hon, look what I'm doing.  You son of a bitch!  It would just ruin your marriage right there.  Damn Laura Corn, man. 
[01:22:30]  Take the picture.  I lost it right in the mid-stride.  Oh, someone doesn't think the answer makes sense.  Michelle.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Michelle.  Hi.  Hi.  That doesn't make any sense, because it's in the dark.  How can you see the picture?  No, no, no.  Okay, okay.  Well, the seduction is, he can't.  When she comes into the room, you know, he's already aroused.  Okay?  Okay.  But he's not looking at the picture.  Yeah.  Well, there's pictures on the bedspread. 
[01:23:00]  Okay?  She doesn't, she sees it, but she doesn't really know what it is.  So, he relights the candle, and then he is stroking himself.  She sees that.  Okay.  He's got her picture in his left hand, her right hand, right?  Okay.  And there's pictures all around on the bed.  And he strokes himself while he looks at the pictures, and then while he looks at her.  Hey, it's Tom Chassano.  Knock it off.  Hey, it's Tom Chassano.  Knock it off.  Hey, it's Tom Chassano.  Knock it off.  Whoa, he's getting pissed over there, K-Rock.  And while he's doing this, he continues to look at you in the chair and in the picture. 
[01:23:30]  Ah.  But how would that make you feel?  Be honest.  Incredible.  Okay.  There's some logistical problems, though.  People are saying, how the hell could he see the picture when the candle's out?  He can't.  He's just, he gets, he's getting himself aroused.  The lights are out.  She knows.  All right.  It's in the darkness.  If you were sitting in a chair, right?  Yeah.  Right.  And you heard him playing with himself.  Oh, my God.  You guys are in so much trouble.  Yeah.  Even the listeners know at this point.  I think we, uh... 
[01:24:00]  Okay.  I think we understand what the guy's doing at this point for the 80th time.  It would give incredible confidence and God, it would make anybody feel incredible.  See?  I know.  All right.  I know it sounds kind of hokey.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I know my wife would probably go, hey, idiot, I'm over here.  With the picture.  Friggin' picture.  I'm sitting over here.  Hello?  Bye-bye. 
[01:24:30]  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  We leave you.  Now with the sounds of Montana.  And me making my face look like a glazed donut.  Before I get back to my wife.  The sounds of the elusive bearded clan.  And me trying to shuck the hell out of that bearded clan. 
[01:25:00]  I usually don't say things like that, but I'll leave you this Sunday morning with the sounds of me giving her the old pile drive.  So now, pictures and sounds of me and the pile drive on my mistress in Montana.  On the road, the road I prefer, pictures now of the Hershey Highway. 
[01:25:30]  I visited that in Montana a lot.  The Hershey Highway.  My wife often thought I was fishing on my trips to Montana.  And it's true I was.  Here's the sound of the trouser trout coming out of my trousers as I pound some ass.  And now the sounds of me pounding ass with my Montana crotch rat. 
[01:26:00]  We leave you now.  The sounds of me and my mistress and me shooting a tray up in that piece.  And now, finally, the sounds of my mistress hobbing my knob.  We don't often leave you with the sounds of knob-hobbing.  I figure this is a good time to leave. 
[01:26:30]  And now the sounds of me and my knob being hob.  Charles Kuralt on the road.  Hob-knock.  Now the sounds of a purple helmet warrior going into battle again against the dreaded bearded clan.  Montana crotch rat. 
[01:27:00]  There's the Montana crotch rat.  God, I wish she shaved.  A little personal hygiene in the groin area.  So it wouldn't look so much like a possum.  Woman looks like roadkill.  Looks like the last time I saw a woodchuck caught in a combine.  Red and brown and whatnot.  Found the sounds of a woodchuck being caught in a combine.  Leave you.  I mentioned she looks like she had Einstein's head in a leg lock. 
[01:27:30]  She trimmed that.  First time I made love to her.  Pulled those panties down and looked like Fidel Castro eating a London broil.  I used to have a lot of sex in my car.  Yes.  Gave her a Spanish fly once.  I found her on the gear shift.  Now the sounds of my girlfriend on the gear shift. 
[01:28:00]  We leave you.  I just wish she was a little better with the hygiene.  It sort of looked like when you take two big pieces of silly putty, slap them together, and throw them in the floor of a barbershop.  All pink and hairy.  The Opie and Anthony of Boobies and Whores shop. 
[01:28:30]  By 7 o'clock, I think you're going to say, you know what, I had a pretty good time today.  1027 WNEW.  MWU.  After the sports guys and before Opie and Anthony, Leslie Gold is the radio chick.  Why would fast food frequenters like the show?  You know, is there a correlation there?  Maybe because this is sort of like fast food radio that we do here.  It's cheap.  It's fast.  Right?  Yeah.  And it doesn't stay with you.  Wow, it's just like the women I like. 
[01:29:00]  Dig the Chick.  Middays, 10 to 2.  1027 WNEW.  How you doing?  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  I got a lot of personality.  I mean, you got to get a key to got personnel.  Try that one, Anthony.  You're listening to Anthony and Opie on WNEW 102.7 Farmer.  Farmer.  Farmer.  Farmer.  Farmer.  I'm over here now. 
[01:29:30]  Wow.  Grim Reaper checking in.  Anthony from hell.  Yeah.  I tried to get IMIS, but he keeps ducking me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ow.  Boy, the lengths I have to go through to get painkillers.  I remember I was hooked on those for quite some time.  Well, you've been off those for a while now, right?  Well, no.  Back on them now, baby.  Yeah.  Broken ribs. 
[01:30:00]  Five broken ribs.  Collarbone.  Separated shoulder.  Yeah, yeah.  And collapsed lung.  So, back on the dope, baby.  Yeah.  Poor Iman.  Crashing to the ground.  Is IMIS insane?  Is he crazy?  I think he was feeling bad that the press hasn't talked about him in a while and figured,  Yeah.  I got to do something here.  I got to collapse a lung.  Oh, destiny. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, oh, whoa.  Well, let me read this a little bit.  Get well wishes going out to Mr. IMIS.  He's hospitalized.  Radio host Don IMIS was hospitalized with multiple injuries after being thrown from a horse at  his ranch in New Mexico.  Yeah, yeah, baby.  IMIS suffered five.  Five broken ribs.  Five?  Ponderous.  A collapsed lung.  A broken collarbone.  And a shoulder separation after being thrown up to ten feet off a horse. 
[01:31:00]  Ten feet?  Ten feet.  Oh, destiny.  That's what happened to Christopher Reeve.  I mean, I don't want to bring that up, but he's lucky.  My big fag cowboy hat broke my fall.  Saved you from breaking your neck, Mr. IMIS?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And my, no, that was my fag bandana.  Oh, I see.  Around my neck.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah, that saved me from, uh, oh, shut up, McCord.  I guess the fan was reporting this morning he's going to be out of commission for a little 
[01:31:30]  while.  For a little while?  Yeah.  Five broken ribs, collapsed lung, broken collarbone, and a shoulder separation is going  to be out for a little while?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shoulder separation, baby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Well, I fall on glass.  Yeah, yeah.  You're using the same sound effect that, uh, that Anthony was using for the Chuck Knobloch  wild throw.  Well, uh, for some reason I don't have someone falling down on this, uh, machine.  No. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, destiny.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good thing I didn't, uh, fall on my face when I hurt the ground.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, shut up, Bernard.  Jerk.  Uh, blah, blah.  420, Imus in the morning program.  Quack, quack.  Actually, it was the, uh, uh, Chuck Knobloch wild throw that, uh, knocked me off my horse.  Ha, ha, ha.  Wouldn't you just, like, I don't know, a lot of joking's been made about how old he is, but 
[01:32:30]  how old is he?  I don't know.  Does anyone have the slightest idea, even close?  Uh, if I had a guess, I'd say, uh, 78.  Yeah, yeah.  Give or take, uh, well, a month.  I don't know how old he is, but to be, uh, hopping on a horse that can throw you 10 feet.  He wants to be a cowboy, Anthony.  Destiny.  I want to be a cowboy, baby.  Yeah, with my big fat cowboy hat and bandana. 
[01:33:00]  Uh, uh, cowboy, baby.  Yeah, yeah.  Crashing to the ground and a-busting a rib.  Cowboy, baby.  Baby.  Cowboy, baby.  Ha, ha, ha.  Cowboy.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Cowboy, baby.  Ah-ha, yeah.  Moby Worm.  Coming to get ya.  Whoa, hold on, Destiny.  Hold on, Destiny.  Ho, ho.  Yeah, I got my, uh, big, fag, 10-gallon cowboy hat.

[01:35:30]  I'm a big, fag cowboy, baby.  Hey, someone stole the fire truck.  What happened there?  What happened to our fire truck?  I don't know.  Someone erased it.  We need one of these for our own.  With the horn and everything, right?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  We got it?  Oh, well, now we got it.  It's over.  Ow.  Who's listening?  Yeah.  Cause I'm a big, fag cowboy, baby.  With my cracked ribs and collapsed lungs,  I'm a cowboy, baby.  Spent all my time at the hospital. 
[01:36:30]  Cowboy, baby.  Oh, Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on there?  I thought there was a memo.  We weren't allowed to talk about other people.  Yeah, that was good for like a week.  No, Mr. Imus can take a joke.  Yeah.  Mr. Imus can take a joke.  He's got a character.  No, Imus can take a joke.  Some people in this company have no sense of humor.  He can't take a joke.  The Imus can take a joke, even with a collapsed lung. 
[01:37:00]  Even for the simple listener folk like me, I understand now.  All right.  Mr. Imus can take a joke.  Yeah.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  It's the Opie and Anthony shoes.  Yeah.  Want to say hi to everyone going to Shea Stadium? 
[01:37:30]  Give them hell, boys.  Give them hell.  Have fun.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Walt Disney World.  Welcome to the Boardwalk Resort Hotel, here on the sprawling Disney Complex.  Seems there's a hostage situation at Disney World, though, bitch.  Yeah, I see that.  Gunman holding, what, a Disney employee hostage at one of the hotels? 
[01:38:00]  Here in the happiest place on Earth.  How are they going to spin that?  You know how Disney hates, like, negative publicity?  Remember that poor guy that got clocked in the head with a cleat off of that big ship in Disney?  The poor guy saves, like, for years to go on a vacation.  What ride was that again?  Do you remember?  It wasn't even a ride.  It was, you know, that big boat, the Columbia, that circles the river on track or something?  Can't you even float a real boat?  It circles this little river. 
[01:38:30]  And they were pulling into port.  And this poor guy, you know, working, slaving, saves his money so they could go to Disney on a vacation.  Him and his family.  He's been waiting in line to get on this stupid boat ride.  Maybe one of the workers stayed out a little too late that night, the night before, throws the rope over the little thing to stop the boat.  The cleat, they're going a little too fast.  The cleat pops off the boat.  Now the rope and cleat fling like a bullwhip and crack this guy right in the skull. 
[01:39:00]  Dropped him right there.  Dead.  Killed him dead.  He's dead.  So what happens?  Disney gets in trouble because they tampered with the scene.  They haul the guy away, hose the blood down.  Business as usual.  Get Mickey out there waving to the kids again.  It's okay.  It's only another human being.  Is that really what happened?  That's what they did.  They got in trouble because, you know, they should have investigated the scene. 
[01:39:30]  The world is a carousel of color.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  The world is a carousel of color.  History, comedy, fantasy.  Here comes the boat, kids.  This is going to be great.  The world is a treasure trove of faces. 
[01:40:00]  Remember that in Disneyland, there was a ride called the American Revolution, it was called,  back in the 70s.  It was a celebration of America.  And, you know, they get a bunch of those cute little kids singing songs and stuff.  And it was on this, it was a rotating arena.  Big, huge, round thing.  And it spun, spun around.  A worker was in the works when it spun around and got caught and crushed in the gears of this thing. 
[01:40:30]  You know what they did?  Business as usual.  Haul him away.  It's Disney.  It doesn't matter.  There have been a few cool deaths at the Disney Space Mountain. 
[01:41:00]  Isn't there a website dedicated to all that crap somewhere?  Yeah, there's Disney deaths.  At Space Mountain, somebody stood up.  Why would you ever stand up?  There was another one, the People Mover at Disney.  You get in there and it goes like one mile an hour.  You have to be a complete idiot to get hurt on this ride.  It just kind of takes you on a little tour.  You ride around and it's like,  We are now inside Space Mountain.  Please no flash photography as we go at one half a mile an hour. 
[01:41:30]  Now as you look upon the sprawling Tomorrowland,  we will take you to Frontierland.  And like this thing is doing one mile an hour.  Somebody, it was going so slow, they get out of one of the cars  and they're going to run on the track up to the next car where their friends are in there.  Trips, gets run over by the car that he got out of.  Crushed, killed.  You know what Disney did?  Huh.  Get out the hose.  Sprayed it down.  Business as usual. 
[01:42:00]  Business as usual.  Sorry for the slight delay.  You seem to have a crushed human being on the track.  But that's okay as we enter Adventureland.  Put on your safari hats.  Hey, Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah, my brother, he used to,  he worked down there a few years ago.  Space Mountain was famous for giving people heart attacks.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, and they used to,  and Disney would pay like this hush money.  You never hear about it.  Yeah, they pay people off or something.  One time on the safari guy, 
[01:42:30]  he used to, you know, like, they make believe,  oh, there's a hippo.  You know, take a shot.  Oh, that's always funny.  Oh, yeah.  As you see a giant elephant on the side.  Look out.  Oh, here comes the water.  Look at that.  You can't tell it's mechanical with that trunk on a hinge.  That's realistically.  Oh, here comes the crocodile.  Oh, let me shoot him.  Oh, yeah, I got him.  Here, let me take these lums out.  And I'll be back on the show.  All right, Kevin.  Make sure you stop off at the souvenir stand  and buy some of this crap for like 80 bucks.  Hey, Dave, what's up? 
[01:43:00]  How you doing?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got another story about someone who died at Disney.  Okay.  What happened was this little girl was riding a small world with her family, right?  And you know how like people throw pennies and stuff into the water?  Oh, yeah.  So like she reaches in to grab a handful or something.  Her hand gets caught in the track.  She gets pulled in and dies.  Jesus.  What did Disney do, Anthony?  Spray it down.  Hold her down.  There's another thing, though.  What's it called? 
[01:43:30]  Disney, they'll never pronounce anyone dead on property.  No, no, that's true.  What do they do?  They'll always wheel them away in an ambulance.  And then they pronounce dead like en route or dead on arrival or something like that.  No one is pronounced dead here at Disney.  They probably have like, you know, Goofy and Pluto come out with a Goofy stretcher  and like grab the guy's wife instead of the guy that's laying there  and then hit each other because it's fake.  Oh, no, wait, it's the guy.  They run off. 
[01:44:00]  Blackie.  It's the wildest ride this side of the Picos.  Make sure you keep your hands and feet inside the ambulance at all times.  Patrick?  Yeah.  What up?  Yeah, I used to work at Disney, too, and that's true.  They gave a guy who got struck by lightning mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  He was better than snot.  I mean, the paramedics were giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation all the way out of the park  because they refused to pronounce him dead.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  That's something.  All right, Patrick.  Like you said, spray it down, keep moving.  All right.  Keep the rides going.  Yeah.  We're trying to find that website.  There it is.  I was there three weeks ago.  Matterhorn bobsled.  The first ride to kill somebody.  Let's see.  From 1955 to 63, Disney's safety record was flawless.  Not all their guests may have left happy, but they did leave alive.  This record ended May 64.  The killer attraction, the Matterhorn bobsled.  A party for 10,000 Long Beach Elks and their guests. 
[01:45:00]  Tragic first victim, 15-year-old Mark Maples of Long Beach.  Let's see.  He argued with a girl over going steady, blah, blah, blah.  His friends had to restrain him from flinging himself to the ground 50 feet below, but there's  no way to stay depressed at Disney.  He was having an argument with his girlfriend, I guess.  He got on the bobsled.  He felt a sudden, inexplicable need to stand up, wanting to stretch his legs or confuse  the simulated bobsled was much more traditional, like a surfing or skiing thing. 
[01:45:30]  His friend just heard some thump noise, and Mark was gone.  No screams, no triumphant shouts of cowabunga.  He catapulted from the speeding car, landed on the track a few feet down, skull fracture,  various injuries, never regained consciousness.  Dead.  Dead.  You know what they did?  He sprayed it down?  Spray it down and let it rock.  Move on.  Danny, what's going on? 
[01:46:00]  Hey, how you guys doing?  Doing well.  Yo, I got a little story for you.  I was down at Disney World with two of my friends about a year and a half ago, two years  ago, and we ended up catching two of the characters having sex together.  And?  It was unbelievable.  And then when we did, we reported it, and they offered to give us a free vacation coming  back, and they said that they give us free tickets to the park.  And my one, my friend, Santo's son, he's like three years old, and we're like, the kid's 
[01:46:30]  never going to forget this.  Mickey Mouse is banging Snow White.  Yeah, how are you going to do it?  They ended up giving us all free passes to the park, a lifetime, for his family, lifetime  free passes to the park.  Another guy tried to get into the park, poor guy, Cleveland, 19-year-old guy, tried to get  into the park by climbing the fence, climbing up one of the poles that hold up the monorail,  and walking on the monorail track into the park.  Come on. 
[01:47:00]  The newspapers could only describe his body as badly mangled.  It dragged him 30 or 40 feet before it could stop.  Spray it down and let the rides roll.  Grant, what's going on?  How's it going?  We're doing well.  Yeah, I used to do my work at Disney World two years ago at the Grand Floridian.  Okay.  And they made you take these Disney University classes.  Yeah.  They have, like, a university on the Disney World grounds. 
[01:47:30]  And it actually told you something happened while, like, someone on a ride to get rid of  it as fast as possible.  Get rid of it, yes.  Get rid of it as fast as possible.  And I worked there.  I've seen some crazy s*** out.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Sorry about that, guys.  Whoa!  Cursing!  Cursing!  Watch out!  Yeah, while they still have at least a slight pulse, they just want to drag them off at  the Disney property.  Dave, what's going on? 
[01:48:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  I want to tell you, a couple of years ago, me and my buddies were down at Disney World,  and one of them got busted for shoplifting.  And when he got out, he said that the jail cell has, like, a big plastic Mickey Mouse with  a frown on his face just holding onto the bars.  Come on!  So they got their own little jail?  Yeah, they got, like, Disney jail.  Yeah.  And then they hold you there until the Orlando police come.  That's funny.  How about Dolly Young of Fremont? 
[01:48:30]  Riding on, again, the Matterhorn bobsled?  Mmm.  Her safety belt unbuckled.  Uh-oh.  She fell to the track, bounced along, while struggling to regain to her feet, a second  speeding sled smashed into her.  The bullet sled dragged her for a car length before stopping with her corpse pinned beneath  its wheels.  She was pronounced dead, uh, a short time later.  Well, probably after they got her off the track. 
[01:49:00]  She's still alive.  Look, her finger's twitching.  Get the hose.  This guy says he has some twisted stories about Disney.  Mark!  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Former, uh, cast member.  Cast member of you.  They're not employees.  They're all cast members.  I was a monorail pilot for, uh, two years.  Pilot.  Yeah.  Like, like, you're going, you know, I'm going to turn left today.  Yeah.  You know, I'm the pilot.  I'm the pilot.  I'm going left. 
[01:49:30]  Now, all seriousness, I mean, there's so many dark secrets about Disney.  I wish somebody would just, like, write a decent book about it already.  I mean, there's, like, one book out there called Mouse Tales.  Give us a couple, man.  You're a pilot.  Well, a friend of mine, like, I...  Tom Cruise over here.  I lived in the condo complex where, um, a friend of mine, uh, there were,  four characters above me.  And, uh, one played Goofy.  The girlfriend was Minnie, whatever.  But, um, big long story short, he, uh, witnessed an accident that, uh,  took place between a company vehicle and, uh, civilian.  And, um, the, uh, accident resulted in a death of a civilian. 
[01:50:00]  And, uh, the local sheriff and also the, uh, Disney cops,  or Disney cops, believe it or not.  Um, and, uh, they told him if he saw anything or if he said anything  that he would lose his job and this and that.  And they threatened him with a bunch of things.  Wow.  That's the way it is.  You got to figure.  They, they bring in so much revenue for the state that they do want to protect it.  Even the police department and everybody else, they don't want to...  No, I mean, it's like, for example, like, the, uh, Atlanta, you know,  when, uh, the bombings in Atlanta went out, lost, uh, during the Olympics,  uh, I was testing, uh, for, uh, my monorail pilot license. 
[01:50:30]  And it's...  Are you kidding?  Isn't it, wait, isn't it just go and stop?  It's a whole test you have to go through.  It's not just pushy.  Please stand clear of the doors.  Is that what?  Please stand clear of the monorail doors.  No, no.  No, no.  It's...  Please stand clear of the doors.  Please stand clear of the doors.  That was it.  That's it.  No, but seriously, uh, some guy walked on our, um, monorail while this girl was testing 
[01:51:00]  and getting her check out.  I want to take this to Cuba!  No, no, no.  He threatened a bomb, and, uh, as soon as that happened, they were going between the  Transportation Center and Epcot Center, and as soon as they got to the other side,  that was where the, uh, the cops were, FBI, and, uh, supposedly, I don't know if this  was true or not, but CIA.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then, uh, I mean, that's got a million stories.  We had a plane crash into us one day.  We had, uh...  A plane crash into Disney?  A little biplane crashed into, uh, just missed the monorail, smacked the beam while the, 
[01:51:30]  uh, monorail was passing over, so that knocked off.  Pay no attention to the flaming aircraft.  Exactly.  Pay no attention, O.  Exactly.  No aircraft, O.  Underneath Disney at night, they have cockfights.  It's amazing.  Actually, you know what?  And this is interesting.  We had a sniper one night.  Get out.  Really?  On the, uh, top of the, uh, contemporary hotel.  This was about, uh, this happened supposedly.  It was, like, five years ago.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I climbed to the top, and, uh, he was ready to open fire.  Wow.  Yeah, there are probably so many deep, dark secrets.  Yeah, we'll continue this discussion, but, uh, I don't know. 
[01:52:00]  We don't want to get fired.  Why?  We're not owned by them.  We got a lot of power.  We're not owned by them.  All these stories are allegedly, right, Anthony?  Uh, no, this is all absolute facts.  No.  Yeah, I don't know.  These people work there, I'm sure.  There you go.  And, Opie, everyone knows we have to get a cease and desist first.  And then, and then we have to shut up.  All right, why don't we take a break, okay?  2-1-2-7-5-7.  1-0-2-7.  We'll be back in just a bit.  More girls, more gooder.  Hookers for everyone. 
[01:52:30]  You want some of this?  You want some of this?  That's the name.  No longer will our penises remain placid and unused.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh.  Come on.  Come on.  Who put that in there?  I thought maybe you'd want to hear this.  What?  The little prelude.  There you go, Opie.  Yeah.  We all remember this.  A little power ballad. 
[01:53:00]  As done by Skid Row.  Sebastian, but why?  I thought maybe you'd want to hear it.  I have no idea what you're getting at.  You don't want to hear Sebastian Bach singing as a little warm-up?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Hey, Ed.  What are you doing?  No, no.  Hey, Ed.  What?  The WWF's Raw's Warriors returning to Madison Square Garden.  It certainly is.  And we teamed up with the New York Daily News for your chance to not only win tickets,  but qualify for the grand prize, Anthony.  Yeah, there it is. 
[01:53:30]  The grand prize is four ringside seats and lunch at the WWF restaurant in Times Square with Rikishi.  I hope that's not tonight.  You won't be able to attend.  All it is, you cry that call my name.  Yeah.  So you're psyched?  You're psyched?  So you're psyched?  Ah, Psycho Mark.  What's going on?  What are you guys laughing at?  Nothing.  Nothing at all.  I'm playing some music for Opie. 
[01:54:00]  Some Sebastian Bach.  And Skid Row, of course.  I just thought maybe Opie might want to hear it.  Gee, a little Jekyll and Hyde.  Ah, maybe, maybe that's it.  Hey, Opie.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  What happened?  Hello?  Hey, Opie.  You're involved tonight, huh?  What?  Opie's got plans this evening.  Yeah, there it is.  So there's a beauty of empathy. 
[01:54:30]  I have found you on empathy.  Mr. Yesterday.  Shut up.  Come on.  I have no idea what you guys are talking about.  This is the moment.  My final day.  Second Mark.  What's up?  All right.  I'm down here at Hooters.  So if you want to come down, get down by 7 o'clock.  They've got $5 calendars.  And they've got the Hooters girls here.  They're absolutely incredible. 
[01:55:00]  They're incredible?  Dude, they're insane.  56 and Broadway.  Get your WOW stickers, right?  Yep.  They'll be right here.  And you get your calendars.  Your calendars, $5.  So where are you from tonight, Opie?  Your phone keeps coming up.  I don't know why you keep hanging up on Psycho Mark when he asks you what you're doing tonight.  So what am I doing?  Going to catch a little show?  What?  What?  Going to catch a little show tonight?  I'm going to go.  What?  What?  What?  What are you doing?  What?  I'm going to where?  I heard going.  What?  What? 
[01:55:30]  I'm going to check on.  It's just a little hard to hear you.  What?  What are you doing?  I'm going to Jekyll and Hyde.  Yes, Jekyll and Hyde.  And of course, you know who's starring in that now? 
[01:56:00]  As Dr. Jekyll and the evil Mr. Hyde, Opie, Sebastian Bach.  You remember Sebastian Skid Rowell.  Let's have a little.  Regis Philbin checking in, Anthony, from ABC Studios.  Oh, yeah.  Ding, ding, ding.  Sounds like it's Opie's turn to be in the hot seat. 
[01:56:30]  Opie, where are you?  We're waiting.  Oh, come on, man.  Jekyll and Hyde.  Are you disappointed that Jack Wagner isn't still Jekyll and Hyde?  Hmm?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think you'll be hearing this one tonight.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think you'll be hearing this one tonight. 
[01:57:00]  Shut up!  Shut up!  Pussah! 
[01:57:30]  Pussah!  All right.  Come on, man.  You're going to make Sandy upset.  She's outside the studio.  She looks lovely tonight.  Going to a little Broadway show.  I thought Privilege liked us.  That would happen.  Remember my little birthday show or whatever?  Yeah.  We saw all that hot gash and stuff.  Sure.  And then at the end of the festivities, they handed me an envelope with tickets inside.  And I'm thinking, wow. 
[01:58:00]  Could be tickets for a great rock show or something.  Something.  Sure.  Tickets for Jekyll and Hyde.  Jekyll and Hyde.  Starring Sebastian Bach.  Thank you, Privilege.  This is the moment.  I made the biggest mistake, though, because I just brought him home.  Yeah.  Showed sand.  Like, oh, here.  Look what the girls from Privilege gave me here.  And I gave him to her.  And I just flat out assumed that, you know, she'd find a girlfriend or someone in her family  and go.  Right.  Right.  Find out early this week that, oh, no. 
[01:58:30]  She's been planning all along to go with moi.  Oh, no.  Opie, even I wouldn't go see that, man.  And that's from Sebastian Bach.  Check in.  Charlie, what's up?  I saw them last night.  Then?  It was awesome.  Well, you're a chick.  No, my boyfriend took me as a surprise.  Yeah.  And he liked it.  And he hates musicals and Broadway shows.  And he liked it because Sebastian rocked.  Oh, yeah?  Yep.  And there was a ton of Sebastian fans there. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, my God.  See?  No, guys.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Are the girls squeezing into their spandex for the Jekyll and Ike?  Come on.  I swear to God, I do not want to go.  Dude, you're going to see a bunch of 80s metal.  Oh, my God.  Like, you didn't like Skid Row anyway.  Oh, come on.  Oh, come on.  I saw Skid Row back in 87, 88.  I dug the show back then.  I've fessed up to a lot of bands on this show, but Skid Row is one I really never really 
[01:59:30]  got into.  Why?  Why?  I just wasn't into Skid Row.  Well, Sebastian's awesome, though, and he has a great voice.  You might not like musicals and stuff like that, but you've got to give him credit.  I mean, he's awesome.  I've got to give him a lot of credit.  He's getting on stage, looking like a toothpick, playing Jekyll and Ike.  What's going to happen when he hits the stage for the first time?  Is everyone going to start screaming?  Are you going to hear girls scream?  No.  No.  Because a lot of the crowd was like, here are the girls also, and they thought he was  awesome also.  Did you hear girls go like, woo, when he came out on stage, though?  No.  No, but he was screaming, you know, in the clapping part. 
[02:00:00]  After he sang, everyone was screaming.  Thank you, Shirley.  Good luck there.  You need a full report tomorrow on the crowd, the audience.  Just take it.  Take the hit.  Go there, but do a full report.  Really be observant to the crowd.  Steve, what's up?  Steve.  Steve.  Opie.  Yeah.  Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know what?  I'm really disappointed in you.  You're really like a hump.  I thought you'd be like going to a strip club tonight.  You going to see that?  I'm not sure you don't queef too loud tonight and disrupt the whole plane. 
[02:00:30]  All right?  I can't handle it.  Queef too loud.  You know it's just begun, too.  Come on, guys.  You understand, right?  Right?  Like you've never been dragged to something you didn't want to do, right?  We've all been there, right?  You guys understand, right?  Have fun.  Jekyll and Hyde.  Oh, yeah.  You won't be hearing this tonight, but you'll be hearing the inimitable voice of Sebastian Bach.  Skid Row. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Remember this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Opie, you sure got a purdy mouth, Sebastian Bach.  Dan from Pinebrook.  Opie, don't forget your comb for your back pocket. 
[02:01:30]  Frank from Manhattan.  Ope, say it ain't so.  What will the rest of the Kiss Army say when they find out that you're now into one of those new fangled 80s glam bands?

This is Ant's Revenge for the No Doubt Day.  Bring your lighter for the Encore.  I thought you guys would understand. 
[02:02:30]  Can Opie wear white shorts?  Shut up.  Just tell him you couldn't get tickets for cats, you pussy.  Oh, Rick will be interested.  A lover boy in Phantom of the Opera.  All right, I'll get you back in.  Fine.  What?  We'll go one for one here.  What did I do?  Does Anthony's girlfriend even know who Skid Row is?  That old gag.

[02:39:30]  tom brokenjoy everyone thank you i guess tom broke on mb3 nightly news  terror at the 33 000 feet as an egypt era the 767 point 
[02:40:00]  tom what the hell is wrong with you today you sound extra groggy  just a little little woozy why are you so woozy today mr broken jaw i was going for my children's  halloween halloween candy and picking out what i thought was inappropriate and i think something  was laced with very pgp or cyanide i haven't felt the same so you got a buzz from your kids m&m's or 
[02:40:30]  something a little woozy yeah it was one of those peanut butter mary janes  appropriately enough named mary jane a slang word for a marijuana cigarette something i'll be doing an  an exclusive expose on in a future episode of embassy nightly news tom broshoff if i may  continue a jet plows into the sea 217 dead egypt air flight crashes 
[02:41:00]  uh tom there's still something really wrong with your voice today yeah i think it's more than just  the pcp from the uh the mary jane candy bars that your kid brought home from trick-or-treating  i mean your mouth's not even moving to be honest with you i i see you're four feet away from me here  always the perceptive opie noticing these things yes opie i was also going through my child's  halloween candy and i found an apple which can be very dangerous yeah pins and razor blades and whatnot 
[02:41:30]  i will be doing an exclusive expose on that on the future mbc latin well i couldn't resist the shiny  red delicious apple and took a bite thus lodging 20 or 30 pins in the roof of tom brokaw's mouth  of which i've only been able to recover three or four so i'm not only well that's more than the  people they have found in the ocean so heavily sedated yes many lives lost jet plows in the sea 
[02:42:00]  off of nantucket island mbc nightland is tom brokaw i am recording now i don't believe jfk jr was on  board so there is some good news for that matter no kennedys were aboard on this one story i don't  believe any kennedy although they did leave from john f kennedy airport yeah so we will be doing an  exclusive retrospective look at the life of john f kennedy for no apparent reason we just have the footage 
[02:42:30]  from when jfk jr look we'll now go to the graphic of young jfk jr saluting his father all right  also an interesting footnote i'm trying to see if uh bernie gets a squirrel involved in this crash  you know if a squirrel gets sucked into a jet engine it could lose power and if it does happen to be  bernie gets a squirrel as i reported being missing months ago it could have spent me in the death of 
[02:43:00]  200 217 people mbc nightly news tom brokaw i'm also reporting this jet did not fly for four hours  with frozen individuals and professional golfers on board no that that was before it crashed very  observant but that was the pain steward tragedy that was last week uh brokaw also had uh reports that  the navy ship the grasp is on its way jesus christ why don't they just buoy the thing out there for god's 
[02:43:30]  sake how many oh was that the music or did i hear it like that from being as heavily sedated  my god just built some docks out for these ships out there it's like the new bermuda triangle  swear to god if i ever take a flight out there never again but the grasp and grapple and all those  ships that pulled debris up from the ocean floor will be making their way out of course i believe this is 
[02:44:00]  still a search and rescue operation that gets a laugh out of tom brokaw the plane lost about 25 000  feet in 30 seconds oh yeah they'll be finding survivors it was an egypt air flight but i doubt they were  wearing crash towels i can't possibly see anyone surviving a 450 mile an hour plummet into the water 
[02:44:30]  you know could you see that guy hey i'm fine i'm over here could you pick me up with that big navy ship  the grapple please maybe my drugs are getting me to editorialize a little more than a respected  newsman said to tom roca give me a freaking break here  well tom yeah it's always a pleasure when you stop by thank you tom brokendall mbc nightly news

[03:13:30]  You know, I mean, I can actually take a joke, unlike other people on the show.  I tried, joke boy.  At least I didn't rip the bathroom door off the wall and smash things.  You didn't recognize, Anna, without the makeup and the nice hair and everything.  It's our own Mark Parenteau from the old jock from Q104, remember?  It's the rear admiral.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Hey, hey, hey, put your hand up my skirt, Mark.  Hey.  Is that your junkie? You just happened to see me. 
[03:14:00]  Jesus.  All right, Eddie.  Oh, boy.  Well, we've got to thank Anna for coming in.  Anna, thank you very much.  A lot of people checking in on the website, saying they went and saw your picture on the website  and said they wouldn't have been able to figure it out either.  Right on.  Wait, we need her to tape a couple things.  If we hit record, will it work?  All right, just hit record.  Or just get on that.  All right.  Anna, repeat after me, in both voices.  All righty.  Look what I did to you again. 
[03:14:30]  Look what I did to you again.  And now, as a guy, look what I did to you again.  Yeah.  All right, we'll be back.  Hey, let me do that one again.  All right, go ahead.  Look what I did to you again.  Oh, my God.  She has a deeper voice than me.  I can sing like a girl and a guy, actually.  Bad.  Bad. 
[03:15:00]  Type-o negative.  Yeah, I can do that.  Type-o negative, really?  I can do a Peter Steele impression.  Really?  Let's hear that.  Can you do that?  Oh, we're looking for trouble, and boy, I found her.  Wow.  Hey, that junk was just in your face, Michael Mark.  Wow.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Radio is a commercial business that you have to do what people want.  What a load of crap. 
[03:15:30]  We don't do traffic.  We don't do weather.  We do nothing.  Did you just sit here and circle, Dad?  That's it.  It's like the birth radio on the planet.  Yes, we know.  O.B. and Anthony's show.  We're so late.  I'm just waiting for you.  Nicey nice.  Nicey nice.  Twice as nice.  Dicey nice.  I'm over.  Hey, that's what I sing in bed, and then you hear this.  Oh.  I love that one.  Dicey nice. 
[03:16:00]  Nicey dice.  Dicey nice.  All right, we'll play that one, too.  Nobody tells me what to do.  Not even me.  Okay, dice.  All right, Anthony.  Charlton Heston.  Yes.  In rehab.  Isn't this so sad?  Well, this coming from, oh, the Inquirer.  Oh.  No, you know what?  It did make the regular paper.  I think when we were in Boston.  And it is an exclusive interview with Charlton Heston. 
[03:16:30]  So, because he's turning his alcoholism into cold, hard cash through the Inquirer.  Holy Moses, Charlton Heston reveals he's checked himself into rehab with drinking problems.  My going into rehab was a good idea for me.  And perhaps a little overdue, laughed Heston.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yes, I'm a drunk.  Drunk.  At age 76, the hero of the Ten Commandments and Planet of the Apes is still a dynamo. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, he's working all right.  Let's see.  He shot an Outer Limits episode.  And, uh, of course, we all know and love him from, uh, the NRA.  He's, uh, very, very into the, uh, guns.  Guns and booze.  Give me a drink.  Where's that Jim Cook?  I could use some Sam Adams.  Damn you all to hell.  Where's my booze? 
[03:17:30]  Why have you forsaken me, God?  Lord God, bring me my, bring me my scotch.  Or I'll, I swear I'll blow up your building.  Wait a minute.  I didn't say that.  Don't have me arrested.  Damn you all to hell.  I'm a drunken bastard.  I knew I had a problem when I was out in a bar one night.  Getting, getting looped as usual. 
[03:18:00]  And a beautiful woman came up to me.  Oh, she was gorgeous.  Blonde hair.  Blue eyes.  Just a knockout.  Nice body.  I took her home.  I gave her the old chalced and chew.  I gave it to her.  I thrust my staff upon thee.  And when I woke up in the morning,  who do you think was laying next to me?  Who?  Dr. Zayas!  It was, Dr. Zayas was laying next to me. 
[03:18:30]  I was having sex with a monkey red mandrel ass.  Oh my God!  Dr. Zayas!  Damn you!  He was pretty good though.  Tight!  Tight!  I love a tight red mandrel monkey ass.  When I'm loopy!  That's when you knew you had a drinking problem, Mr. Heston.  That's when I knew him.  Yeah.  He does those commercials, right?  Doesn't he do Bud's Light commercials?  Yes, he does, Anthony. 
[03:19:00]  So I'm hanging out in a bar,  and I see Charlton Heston.  You see Charlton Heston?  Yeah, and he's like drinking a lot.  He's pretty hammered.  Quite hammered indeed.  So I'm like, you know,  I say, hey, you're Charlton Heston.  And he punched me in the face.  I punched him in the face.  Indeed I did.  I was drunk!  Yeah, so I was asking him for his autograph.  I just wanted an autograph. 
[03:19:30]  What to do?  What to do?  What to do?  Get another drink!  Over here!  Quick, damn it!  I haven't had one in minutes!  Oh my God, he's taking the knife out of the cheese!  Do you think he wants some cheese?  Oh, you're a hedge!  It's a goner, damn you!  Damn you!  And, uh, yeah, he was pretty effed up.  Quite effed up indeed.  So, uh, I said, Chuck, you okay? 
[03:20:00]  You know, because I was concerned.  Concerned for a friend.  And, uh, what did he do?  He bent over and puked on my shoes.  I puked on his shoes!  Yes, I puked on his shoes.  Quite the celebrity bubble to take home with you.  Charlton, puke!  Oh, we'd get, we'd get trashed back in the old days of Hollywood.  I'd get trashed with all of them.  And then we'd go out and bang whores. 
[03:20:30]  Ah, the old days.  And they'd always end up in my bed, red mandrel ass up, taking it in the back door.  Much like high-pitched Eric at Rikers.  Butt sex.  Yes, I love the butt sex.  That's right.  Give me another drink.  Yeah, yeah, guns and booze.  That's what I like.  I've been known to hobnob when I get past. 
[03:21:00]  You know why I parted the Red Sea?  Not to free my people.  There was booze on the other side.  Lord God!  Spread these waters!  Get me a bottle of Howling Monkey, old dirty.  Quick, I need some ripples.  Zira, get me a shot, you furry-ass red-mask-bandrel bitch.  Damn you!  Soil and green!  It's scotch!  Oh, good! 
[03:21:30]  So, like, I asked Chuck if he needed a cab.  He asked if I needed a cab!  No, he said, no, I'll drive.  Indeed I did.  Three people didn't care.  I'm Charlton Heston.  I need a Fody.  Yes!  Come here, my long-haired friend.  Can I buy you a Seabreeze?  Here at Nobu!  What?  I didn't break the gag, Oden. 
[03:22:00]  I'm in character, like Mr. Harmon.  Damn, I was at the Republican convention.  Did you see Colin Powell's speech?  Ah, yes.  What a well-spoken darkie!  I'm drunk!  I have an excuse!  And that piece of ass, Bush's...  Is that his daughter or granddaughter?  She's, what, 18?  Two daughters!  Twins.  Oh!  Two ponderous! 
[03:22:30]  Epic ponderous!  Is that Don on the phone?  Where's my goddamn drink?  I love it.  I cast this staff across the Nile and turn it into schnapps!  Goddamn, I'm a lush!  Oh, Mr. Heston and Re-Nab, yes. 
[03:23:00]  Ever since the burning bush talked to me, I needed a drink.  See me come down from that mountain, my hair was white!  It's like, goddamn, get me a drink!  Let my people go to the bar!  It's happy hour!  That was the quote!  They stopped it after go!  Oh!  Damn you!  So now I'm in rehab!  I need it!  Look at my wife! 
[03:23:30]  Goddamn!  What's with that face?  She's like a cartoon character!  You see that?  Her lips, though, look!  Red lipstick she wears!  Reminds me of Zira's red monkey ass!  I treat it the same way, too!  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Heston and Rehab.  Yeah.  Wandered the desert for 40 years!  Looking for an open gin mill!  For happy hour! 
[03:24:00]  Let my people drink!  All right.  There it is.  Yeah.  There's your coverage.  Breaking news.  What else does it say in there?  Anything?  Well, let's see.  Bud Light, I said.  Yeah.  So I saw him in the...  Saw Chuck Heston in the bathroom.  Saw him in the bathroom.  Yeah.  He was, you know, up in the urinal next to me. 
[03:24:30]  Sharing a urinal.  No, not sharing one.  That would be gay.  Gay indeed.  And, uh, when I glanced over, I noticed you were peeing on my shoes, Mr. Heston.  Peeing on your shoes!  Quite a treat.  A shoe shine with a famous person's urine.  Damn, I'm hammered right now!  Yeah, he's in rehab now, Opie.  You'd be happy to know.  Okay. 
[03:25:00]  Alcohol and gay sex in the bathroom.  Charlton Heston.  Shoving his mighty staff through a glory hole.  But, yes, I do reciprocate.  I'm hammered.  What do I know?  The joke's on them, because I'm not gay.  I'm just drunk.  Damn you!  Damn you, booze!  What to turn me into a homosexual!  Where does it say that in this story?  The joke has been on gay sex when he was drunk. 
[03:25:30]  It doesn't say that.  I think you're drunk.  Anthony, I do much coffee.  All right.  Yeah, it says that, uh, it was because of his, uh, hectic Hollywood schedule and campaigning  and, uh, representing the NRA that, uh, turned him to booze.  And now, God willing, Opie, God willing, Chuck Heston will, uh, stop drinking.  Okay.  Yeah, so he's, uh, he's fine.  He's doing okay? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  Thank God.  Yeah.  Imagine that, Chuck Heston in rehab.  It's a madhouse!  A madhouse!  I need a creamy head with Jim Cook.  Look, you can float a bottle cap on him.  All right.  We'll take a break, Anthony.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, I don't know.  Go F yourself! 
[03:26:30]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-1-0-2-7-2-N-E-W.  It is Opie and Anthony.  Hello, how are you guys?  Thanks for joining us.  There you go.  Um, Hillary Clinton has announced that she's officially running, Anthony.  What a surprise.  For the Senate seat?  Jeez, does that mean we don't have to foot the bill anymore for every trip she makes here?  Twat.  Oh. 
[03:27:00]  So finally she announced, and what does that mean?  What does she do now?  Well, she had her speech, uh, yesterday.  I checked that out.  Mm-hmm.  She pretty much wants to solve every single problem facing the world.  Where did all that money come from?  The working slob.  Oh, she'll, oh.  I'm getting scared.  I'm getting scared.  I think she's going to win this damn election.  No.  And I'm, I'm, I, it scares the crap out of me.  No.  I think there's enough stupid people out there that, that, that, that's going to push her 
[03:27:30]  over the top, Anthony.  I still think Rudy's, uh.  Rudy has a narrow lead at this point.  Narrow lead.  I don't know.  They haven't started the mudslinging commercials yet, really.  There'll be some great ones.  She couldn't keep tabs on her husband's affairs.  Are you going to elect her to take care of yours?  Paid for it, my friend, a roadie, Johnny.  Hey, honey.  Hey, Dave, what's going on?  Hey, they both suck, okay?  Yeah, okay.  I cannot think of, I can't think of who I dislike more.  I mean. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, that's a great way to look at it.  Everybody, everybody in New York thinks Rudy's like a big bully.  I mean, he gets things done, but he's like this big bully.  And you don't do it my way.  I'll just push you around until I get what I want.  Okay.  So that's, that's Rudy's side of it.  Now you take Hillary, and she doesn't know a damn thing about what she's doing here.  Doesn't have a clue.  The only reason she's in New York is because New York will let her, without being a true resident, run for Senate, right?  Correct.  She doesn't get into the Senate.  Bill is history, too. 
[03:28:30]  How long do you think he'll be around?  I hope a while.  I want to see him do stuff.  I know.  We all want to see him around.  Goddamn, I want to see him just party his ass off when he gets out of office.  Oh, it's going to be interesting after he leaves office.  He's great material, but.  Something's going to go horribly wrong with that guy.  I mean, everybody in New York has got to lose their mind to vote Hillary in, though.  Well, I'm starting to worry about this one.  And that's an insult to New Yorkers, isn't it?  Maybe that'll be the way Bill will get back at Hillary.  Like, for being such a bitch to him and not giving him any and stuff like that. 
[03:29:00]  He'll just treat her like crap and ruin her name.  You know what I mean?  That'll be fun.  Like, she'll be trying to be this legitimate politician.  And he'll just go out and bang chicks and hang out in the booby bars.  Wouldn't that be a great episode of Cops?  All of a sudden, the cop gets a call.  Hey, we have a domestic dispute in Chapel Hill.  And Bill just comes out with his wife beater t-shirt on.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  All hammered. 
[03:29:30]  What the hell do you think?  She comes home all hours.  You know, drunk and everything.  Yeah, I had a girl in the house, but we wasn't doing nothing.  Like, all stained.  Like, he's wearing this wife beater guinea tea all stained up and everything.  Comes out of the house.  All right, Mr. President.  Please go back in the house.  Mr. President, back in the house.  You can't make me do anything.  It's my house.  My house.  I don't care what that bitch says.  F you, man.  F you.  We need backup here. 
[03:30:00]  One more time and you're going in.  One more time, Mr. President.  Hey, go after yourself.  Okay.  Against the car.  Yeah.  Against the car.  Yeah.  Hey, what do you do?  I didn't do nothing.  I didn't do nothing.  That would be great, man.  That would be hilarious.  Very good, man.  Come in the house.  He's just sitting there with his hand down his pants watching TV.  What?  What?  Drinking.  And then the cop.  He's got a big bruise on her eye. 
[03:30:30]  You beat me.  And then the cop's asking Clinton if he was drinking tonight.  Been drinking.  I might have had a few.  It's my house.  My business.  I'm the president.  God damn it.  Go screw yourself.  I'll have your job.  What's your badge now?  I would laugh my ass off.  Cops.  The little cop driving back.  You know, how to arrest the president today.  You know, you never know what's going to, what a day is going to bring this job.  Cops. 
[03:31:00]  Get away from my house.  And the bitch deserved it.  I don't know what you're talking about.  This is my house.  My house.  God damn it.  I was the president.  Get back in your car, you pig.  He tries to stab her with a steak knife.  Get your hands.  F you, man.  F you.  Did you ever see the cops episode where the guy got his ear cut off by his wife?  Yeah.  And they had to find the ear?  Yeah.  That was great. 
[03:31:30]  That show rocks.  Cops.  So I had a chick in the house.  She didn't have to get all effing up about it.  I don't understand.  Mr. President, you know, your wife's very upset.  Why don't maybe, you know, you could leave the household tonight.  They will take you somewhere.  F you, my house.  That bitch don't like it.  She could leave.  I never wanted to move to New York anyway.  You go screw yourself.  Mr. President, if you keep mouthing off, we're going to have to take in.  Take me in.  Go eff yourself. 
[03:32:00]  That bitch.  I'll smack her again.  Okay, Mr. President.  I got the car.  Bad boy.  Bad boy.  What's going on?  We need backup.  The President's running.  The President's running.  He's on the run down the street.  Down the street.  What's he going to do?  Get the helicopter on him.  Get the helicopter on him.  You got nothing on me.  And they have to tackle him.  It's like trying to get over a fence and they set the dogs out there.  Get away.  Get away.  Come on.  Or my favorite thing on tops. 
[03:32:30]  Like they lose them for a little while and then like all of a sudden they shine the light  up in the tree and there's the President hiding in the tree.  Well, they kick over the kid pool and Clinton's hiding underneath it.  What?  I didn't do nothing.  What?  We can all look forward to that.  If she does win.  That could be cool.  Cop out of breath jumping over the neighborhood fences.  The President's in custody.  I need a car over here. 
[03:33:00]  Well, Mr. President ran down the street.  I took Chase.  He tried to make it over the fence.  But a few too many trips to McDonald's.  The extra weight.  I was able to bring him down pretty easy and put the President in custody.  F you, man.  Hitting his head against the police car window.  F you.  Trying to kick it out.  A stained guinea tea on.  You tell that bitch I ain't coming back.  He throws something away while he's running away from the cops. 
[03:33:30]  We found these bits of crack as he was running.  The President's running this.  He's testing positive as crack cocaine.  Mr. President, you got anything in your pockets?  No.  I didn't do it.  It wasn't mine.  Man, I was holding it for Chelsea.  It almost makes you want to have her win, doesn't it?  I love it. 
[03:34:00]  Trying to kick the back window out.  Running with cuffs on.  Or he gets on his little bike.  That's always good in cops, too.  The President gets on a bike and tries to get away from the cops.  He's running.  I wasn't running.  What?  And they try to...  They're so obviously guilty.  And then they catch him.  They're confident. 
[03:34:30]  Like, what?  What?  What?  Episode of the President of the United States.  What'd I do?  Very nice.  She's a fat bitch.  Look at that ass.  Cops.  Brought to you with the co-operative men and women of blood.  F you.  F you.  Opie and Anthony.
