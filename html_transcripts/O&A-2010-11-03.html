<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the midterm election results, featuring studio guest Jim Norton.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Norton engaged in vulgar jokes about the names of various politicians, including Boehner, Crapo (repeatedly misspelled for comedic effect), and Coons, and criticized Andrew Cuomo and Chuck Schumer.  Sean Hannity then joined the show via phone.  Hannity described the Republican victory as a "massacre," expressed surprise at Harry Reid's reelection, attributing it to union pressure, and debated the hosts about government censorship versus corporate influence on free speech.  He credited Opie and Anthony for their outspokenness.

The conversation with Hannity continued, focusing on political ideologies, high taxes, and the portrayal of successful people as villains.  They debated potential 2012 Republican presidential candidates (Palin, Gingrich, Rubio), the harsh treatment of conservative women in the media (using Palin as an example), and Hannity shared personal anecdotes about his family, faith, and marriage, touching on sex before marriage and gay marriage.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the election and the political climate.

Following Hannity's call, the hosts discussed the *Jersey Shore* cast, specifically "The Situation," speculating about his future, and MTV's apology to GLAAD for a transphobic reunion segment, using humorous and offensive language throughout.  Jason Schwartzman then joined the show as a studio guest.

The conversation with Schwartzman covered his acting career, from his discomfort in high school theater to his experiences with Wes Anderson and Bill Murray on *Rushmore*, and the intense pressure of HBO table reads.  He discussed his fascination with drama and conflict, recounting a bizarre watermelon-throwing incident he witnessed.  He also described the uncomfortable on-set argument between Lily Tomlin and David O. Russell during *I Heart Huckabees*.

The conversation shifted to an incident involving the show’s intern, Stevie, and Bobby Lee. Bobby Lee entered the studio, and after showing Stevie his underwear, Stevie’s reaction led to a physical altercation escalating when Stevie's friend, "Pauly the Penis," entered in a pink outfit.  This altercation ended when Bobby Lee disrobed completely.  A heated discussion ensued between Bobby Lee and Stevie, involving accusations of rape and insults, focusing on Stevie's family, specifically his sisters, before concluding with Bobby Lee discussing his pornography preferences and graphically detailing a childhood experience involving molestation by a man with Down syndrome.

Bobby Lee remained a main focus for a significant portion of the show.  He discussed a past incident involving a person with Down syndrome, euphemistically referred to as a "finger fiesta" and a "bargain" for candy.  He detailed his past drug addiction and sobriety, recounted awkward past experiences on the show (including witnessing male genitalia and looking into a 54-year-old man's anus), and revisited the incident with the person with Down syndrome with graphic details, debating whether it constituted molestation.  An awkward apology sequence with Stevie followed, ending with cheek kisses.  He expressed frustration with being mistaken for other Asian comedians, particularly Ken Jeong, detailing instances of mistreatment in Hollywood, including his experiences on *Pineapple Express*. He speculated that the negative press surrounding Mel Gibson was orchestrated, shared further on-set anecdotes, and compared his career trajectory to Craig Robinson and Ken Jeong.  He briefly mentioned Carlos Mencia and left and returned to the studio multiple times. Danny Pudi, from *Community*, was a brief guest during this segment.

A heated exchange between Opie and Bobby Lee about Bobby Lee’s volatile personality and defense mechanisms followed, leading to a discussion of cultural versus personal issues.  The conversation shifted to Danny Pudi's experiences in the entertainment industry, leading to a playful back-and-forth about Pudi's positive demeanor.  The conversation expanded to the challenges and disrespect faced by stand-up comedians versus the perceived easier paths and higher pay in film and television. The hosts and guests discussed successful comedians (Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Carrey), the difficulties of bombing on stage, different comedy clubs, and various other comedians (Voss, Keith Robinson).  Jim Norton shared anecdotes about his early stand-up experiences. The conversation included numerous offensive jokes and racial slurs, particularly targeting Asian and Black communities, referencing Bobby Lee's behavior and Black representation in television and comedy.  Finally, Danny Pudi promoted *Community*, and Patrice O'Neal's upcoming stand-up show was promoted before the show concluded.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal.  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio, satellite radio.  Apparently, Opie and Anthony are dicks.  Oh, here they go again.  It's a fun, dopey radio show.  Not just any radio show.  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dream.  The show is a lot funnier on any W.  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie.  Not an original team.  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us.  It's just astounding to me. 
[00:00:30]  I didn't want to say it's racist, but god damn.  This show will rock as best as we can possibly do this radio show.  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later.  There you go, all right?  God, we just lost our demo, man.  What's wrong with you?  You're just the last draw for the watching radio duo.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Ah, there we are. 
[00:01:00]  Hi, folks.  Hello.  It's an L in folks.  Kenny, can I get a cup of coffee, please?  Of course.  I need another cup of coffee.  Got to wake up.  What would you...  You up late watching the election results?  Not really.  I was watching.  Ready for this?  Yeah.  Jersey Shore.  Oh, yeah.  Because we got the sitch coming in on Friday.  So I figured maybe I should watch the show to be a little informed.  Is there anything new you need to know?  Not really, no.  It was a waste of time.  That's what I was assuming. 
[00:01:30]  It really was a waste of time.  I don't even know what to ask the sitch on Friday.  But that's really what I was watching.  And I did make sure that the Republicans did what everyone thought they were going to do.  Take the house.  They took the house.  And I said, okay, that's all I need to know.  And then I did see...  All right.  I did see a little bit.  I was going back and forth.  That the witch.  I saw the witch.  Yes.  Pelosi.  Oh.  Well, no.  She's the bitch.  Oh.  There's a bitch and there's a witch.  Yeah.  What's her name?  Chris O'Donnell.  Oh, huh? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  What about her?  She wants to be the next Sarah Palin, obviously.  She wants to be a media darling.  Yeah.  And they're already speculating that she would be perfect for Fox News.  The Fox News channel.  Yeah.  Fox News loves pulling them all in.  So, I don't know.  I'm happy Pelosi's out.  Good.  Is she out?  Oh, yeah.  No more Speaker of the House.  Yay.  Bye-bye.  We have Boehner.  I like how he pronounces his name.  Boner.  It's Boner.  It is Boner.  I just look at...  I see Boner. 
[00:02:30]  That's a guy that wanted to do something serious with his life, but he had the name Boner.  Boner.  So, he changed to Boehner.  To Boehner.  But, I mean...  There's another guy out there named Crapo.  Crapo.  It's Crapo.  Your name's fucking Crapo, dude.  Don't even try to...  It's crap with an O at the end.  It's Crapo.  Yeah.  I love the people that add a little French to the bad names to make it sound like something.  Coons won, too.  I know.  Did he win?  Did Coons win?  On Twitter, I saw Fred from Brooklyn saying that there's Coons running... 
[00:03:00]  What?  Is it Ohio?  Yeah.  Where's Coons from?  It's Ohio.  I guess he beat the witch, right?  And I was like, wow.  Fred from Brooklyn being an awful racist.  Delaware.  And then I realized, oh, there's a guy named Coons.  Yeah.  Coons.  It is Crapo.  It is Crapo.  No, look at Crapo.  They were like, and Crapo in Idaho, Crapo.  No, it's Crapo.  It's like, no.  No, it's Crapo.  C-R-A-P-O is Crapo.  That's Crapo. 
[00:03:30]  I don't care how you...  Take the O off.  It's not Crape.  How do you make it into Crapo?  I think you have to go C-R-A-P...  You guys might not like this, but I think that Crapo would be...  Because I think it's a hard A if it's one P, and if it double P's, it becomes softer.  Crapo, yeah.  Yeah, like...  Are you sure?  Like, um...  That's Crapo.  Look at it.  It just looks like Crapo.  Of course it does.  His childhood was horrendous because of that name. 
[00:04:00]  It certainly was.  This might surprise all of you, but I was really awful in English in high school.  No, you weren't.  And that certainly looks like Crapo to me.  Looks like Crapo.  That's it.  Yeah, Crapo would have to be C-R-A-Y.  P-O.  Crapo.  Well, how do you spell Crape?  C-R-E-P-E-S, I think.  C-R-E-P-E.  Yeah, but then if you put an E in, it becomes Crapeo.  Crapeo.  But if you put two P's...  Yeah, yeah.  That's Crapo.  Then it's Crapo. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  But this is probably Crapo.  But he's still shit.  Let's just say that.  It's just Crapo.  Yeah.  We all think crap.  It's duty with an O afterwards.  Yes, it is.  Do they have the results?  So we know how many votes each person in New York...  I want to see how did Kristen Davis do and how did McMillan do?  McMillan got 1%.  1%.  1% of the vote.  1% of the vote, which means about 28 votes I think he got.  Is that more than 50,000, though?  Because you need that to get on the...  It's got to be.  Maybe not.  I don't know. 
[00:05:00]  Where is that shit?  Yeah, I don't know where the rest of it is.  I mean, how many people vote in New York and New York State?  I don't know.  They have the giant Cuomo headlines here in New York from Andrew Cuomo, Mario's son, is  the governor of New York now.  I guess he was the best choice, I guess, considering...  He was really the only choice, but...  He was the only one that was going to win.  Like, Palladino is a raving lunatic.  They weren't going to elect him.  And New York is just such a democratic state. 
[00:05:30]  Or at least the city.  The state tends to run Republican, but it's like...  Does it really?  Yeah, believe it or not, like upstate and shit like that, but the city has such influence.  Buffalo and Rochester and all that is sort of Republican?  Yeah.  That's what I know is upstate.  That's way upstate.  But, you know, Chuck Schumer's back.  I hate Schumer.  We've got to deal with Schumer and his big issues like video games.  Really?  And fucking sugar and shit like that. 
[00:06:00]  Aspartame.  Yeah, while, you know, the state is just going broke.  Yeah, let's worry about aspartame.  So he's back and...  You should move.  Jill DeBrand is in.  She's finishing out the rest of her term.  Yeah, I ain't going to move.  But you should.  Where am I going?  You would be great in a Republican state, man.  You would love that shit.  Wouldn't you?  It would be great.  What's the nearest Republican state from here?  I don't even know.  Oh, no.  We're going to have to go.  It certainly isn't Massachusetts.  It's certainly not New York.  PA.  Is it PA?  I think PA took a few... 
[00:06:30]  PA's a Republican...  Well, isn't that a wishy-washy state?  Yeah, they're a little wishy-washy.  Them and Ohio.  I don't want to live in PA anyway.  And Florida.  Doesn't the election come down to those three states usually?  Yeah, yeah.  See, I know a little bit about politics.  Whichever way they swing.  A little bit.  Whichever way they swing.  I don't know.  I'm very surprised.  Harry Reid in Nevada held on to his seat.  How the fuck did that happen?  Well, how many people got kicked out?  Was it a bloodbath ant? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's the biggest turnover in 70 years or so.  70?  Yeah, the biggest political turnover as far as the House goes.  And the Senate got real close, too.  So they don't have as big a majority as they used to.  Isn't it amazing?  The same thing that got the Democrats in, which was discussed with the Republicans.  Yeah.  Got them out a couple years later.  Two years later.  People have just had enough.  Really, they have.  And Obama spent all that time instead of trying to run the country.  The president shouldn't be forced to sit in the fucking White House and run the country.  Not campaign for people. 
[00:07:30]  Not campaign while you're on the job.  You know what's amazing?  Or do it on your vacation time or something, whatever.  Fucking figure something out.  When was the last time you saw our blind-as-a-bat governor do anything?  True.  He's been out of the news.  He hasn't done anything.  Are we done with him now?  In January.  In January.  Right, right.  But, like, you think he's going to do anything now?  Nah.  Lame gut action.  He hasn't even been in the news.  He hasn't done anything.  Your boy's on the line.  Oh.  He's not my boy. 
[00:08:00]  Sean Hannity.  What is your boy stuff?  Hi, Sean.  Did you show up and vote yesterday?  Me?  No, I don't vote.  I absolutely did.  Anthony voted, yes.  No, Anthony voted.  Yes.  Who else was in today?  Norton.  I had an injury.  I couldn't vote.  You pulled a hammy.  You couldn't get down there.  Yeah, I was injured, Sean.  What was the injury?  I hurt my arm when I should have registered a while ago, and I didn't.  I know.  Jimmy, you don't vote.  No.  You're killing me.  I know.  I admit I'm an ass.  I don't, though. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  I voted, and then I watched the results.  A couple of surprises that I'd like to talk to you about.  This is a massacre.  Oh, I know.  I know.  Absolute massacre.  I want to know how Harry Reid held on to his job.  You know, I've got to tell you, that was, for me, the biggest surprise of the night.  Absolutely.  And, look, he has an effective machine out there.  You know, we got reports that, you know, people that are working in some of the casinos, like  Harrah's and others, you know, were being told by their bosses, go out and vote, guys. 
[00:09:00]  You know, so there was a lot of pressure, a lot of union support that he has, and, you  know, I like Sharon Engel a lot.  I got to meet her.  I've interviewed her a number of times.  We did our Freedom concert out there, and she went on stage.  Lovely woman.  And I thought, you know, she probably could have run a better campaign in terms of her  communication, but she's not a professional politician, so I think that might have hurt  her a little bit. 
[00:09:30]  And, you know, Harry Reid was vicious.  Absolutely brutal.  Yeah, but you look at the issues, you know, highest unemployment and just in bed with every  step of the way with Pelosi and Obama, you would think that out of anybody, he would have  been the one shown the door.  He would have been kicked in, well, what do we say, Norton?  Would have been kicked right there and out the door.  Yeah.  I don't usually say right there, but since you're on the phone.  Now let's go back to Opie.  Opie, what happened? 
[00:10:00]  Oh, why are you beating me up?  Why the hell are you beating me up?  What?  First of all, why won't you come on Hannity, the TV show?  Norton comes on.  He's obsessed with me being on his show.  He's right on the TV show.  Yes.  You know, Anthony comes on and kicks butt on the TV show.  And I keep saying, well, where's Opie?  What's up with Opie?  Can we talk pop culture or something?  I don't want to talk politics.  Well, we could talk pop culture.  What do you want to talk pop culture?  Listen, do you...  You don't know the first thing about pop culture.  Just like I don't know shit about politics.  What do you want me to tell you about pop culture? 
[00:10:30]  What do you know about pop culture?  Ask me a question.  I'll tell you if I know anything about it.  Name three people from the Jersey Shore.  Snooki.  Okay, good.  And I forget the other thing.  You knew Snooki.  Ask me if I've ever watched an episode.  No, ask me to name three senators.  I couldn't do it, so...  You know, but here's the point, and Anthony will tell you this, too.  Do you even care?  Do you look at, like, how much...  Look, I know you're a zillionaire, and you make a lot of money with the radio. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  All right, but do you even care that if you live in New York, you're going to pay six out of every...  60 cents out of every dollar in taxes.  Does that not eat away at your mind?  If I knew how much money I made, it would...  A long time ago, I decided not to really know how much money I make.  That's unbelievable.  I'm serious.  It destroys me.  It is the bane of my existence to sit there and watch them just keep digging into my pockets 
[00:11:30]  and making us the villains, yet the supporters.  We've got to sit in the back.  We're the enemies.  Yeah, yeah.  The bad guys, because you've done everything that this country...  The opportunities that this country has, you've used the opportunities, made something  of yourself, and all of a sudden, you're the bad guy.  Do you know how many people, Anthony, I swear, have come up to me and said,  I can't believe I listen to Opie and Anthony all the time, and Anthony really knows his 
[00:12:00]  stuff.  And then they think, what's up with Opie?  Opie.  Oh!  I have all the things to do.  Let me ask you a basic question, Sean Hannity.  You want to go on offense?  Here we go.  Let's get on.  No, no, no.  And I actually enjoy watching you on the TV.  I do.  You know that.  No, I don't.  All right.  Now, you said...  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You said there was a bloodbath last night, right?  It was a bloodbath.  Okay.  I'm going to go down to the basics, because that's how I deal with politics. 
[00:12:30]  What will change now that there was a bloodbath last night?  I'll tell you, it's like America's boat was taken on water, and the boat's about to sink.  And what was sinking was the American dream.  What was sinking is America's a land of opportunity.  What's, you know, look, if you lived your life the way government was working now, where  literally, you know, we took on, in the short time that Obama was president, $3 trillion  in new debt. 
[00:13:00]  That's more debt than every president from Washington up to and including the eight years  of Ronald Reagan.  And we did it because, you know, look, Obama, when he talked about change, was not just talking  about changing Washington, but literally transforming American society away from an opportunity society  where, you know, people would be pioneers, and they'd work hard, and they'd take care  of their families.  You know, when my grandparents came here into this country, they didn't have guaranteed  health care. 
[00:13:30]  They didn't have guaranteed day care.  We weren't bailing out banks and financial institutions.  Government wasn't buying car companies.  We weren't spending recklessly with this Keynesian economic model of redistribution.  America was a land where, you know, individuals were a responsibility for their own life.  You know, look, I would argue, I've listened to you guys enough over the years, you don't  want government in your life when it comes to what it is you can or cannot say on the radio.  You don't want anybody in the government in your private life in terms of what it is 
[00:14:00]  you're doing, who you're dating, who you're sleeping with, what you're doing.  I'll take the one point on because I see Norton, too.  I don't worry about what the government says as far as what we can say on the radio.  I worry about the company itself now, the special interest groups, corporations in general.  They're way out of control before the government is.  And, Sean, to be honest, when it comes to what we do on the air, and believe me,  the Democrats' political correctness is sickness. 
[00:14:30]  But I think the Republicans made it worse for us, and I hate to say that, but I really  do.  I think it was a lot worse for us when the fines get tenfolded on terrestrial radio, and  that was all the morality of conservatives, and that's where they lose me.  That was Tipper Gore.  That was a lot of people.  It wasn't me.  No, no, no, not the First Amendment.  And I can tell you as a conservative, and in this sense, I have a lot of libertarian leanings.  I don't want the government telling anybody what they can and cannot say on the radio. 
[00:15:00]  Look, here's the environment.  Look, you guys are on satellite, which I know has grown by leaps and bounds, and you have  a freedom that I can tell you that does not exist for me on terrestrial radio.  There are people, and I can prove it to you, who have in some cases George Soros money, whose  only job is to sit in their underwear every day in the hopes that me or Rush or Levin or  Bortz or any talk show host or Imus, that we say one word, one sentence, one phrase, and 
[00:15:30]  they don't like it, and they then get that information out to special interest groups,  and then they begin either one or two campaigns.  They target your advertisers.  That's an attempt to silence your speech.  Or they go directly at your company and try and get you fired for what it is you said.  It's mob tactics they use.  I find you to be the exception, though.  You're the exception rather than the rule when it comes to conservatives.  You're right.  That is more libertarian.  You're one of the very few guys on that side of the fence that really does go to bat for 
[00:16:00]  guys like this show.  And I remember when we were kicked off the air, you did.  Oh, yeah.  You're one of the very few guys that does.  But that's where the conservatives lose me a lot.  Well, you know, look, there are some people, it's a very simple solution if you don't like  what you're hearing on the radio.  Turn the dial.  Right.  You were one of the few that stuck up for Imus, and man, you stuck up for us, too, which  was amazing.  I'm like, why is Sean sticking up for us?  Is it crazy?  You know what it is?  We're duty joke guys.  You are a thorn of my side.  It goes in phases, too, honestly, because I don't think what's on the radio is going 
[00:16:30]  to be of concern to a lot of Republicans right now.  I think they have the work cut out for them, patching the holes that were made in the past  two years with Obama in there and Pelosi.  Thank God she's done.  Oh, I don't have to.  I want to manage everybody's expectations.  Look, these guys are going to get in there, and they're going to vote to repeal health  care.  That's great.  Yeah.  But the president's not going to let it down.  He's going to veto it. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, of course.  They're going to vote to extend the Bush tax cuts.  Yeah.  Maybe it happens.  Maybe it's temporary.  Maybe it's not.  I don't know.  They're going to vote to rein in spending.  There's going to be major fights on this.  And I think what's going to happen is you're going to see emerging two very different visions  and choices for 2012.  And Republicans are going to make the argument, look, we only have the House of Representatives.  You guys got the Senate.  You got the White House.  The president has power.  If you give us the power, all these things that we did in the House, we will nationalize. 
[00:17:30]  And depending on what the state of the economy is at the time and whether or not some of  this Keynesian spending gets under control, I think Obama's in trouble.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  I think the Republican Party has to start really grooming somebody now.  Agreed.  Or else, again, like look at what happened here in New York as far as the governor goes.  There was no hope for any Republican to try to challenge Cuomo. 
[00:18:00]  I'm amazed they didn't have anybody here in New York there, Sean.  Yeah, look, the New York Republican Party, I will tell you, it's almost non-existent.  It's a disaster.  Chuckie Schumer's back in there.  By the way, could you imagine if Harry Reid lost, he'd be the guy.  I know, yeah.  I mean, it's almost, there might be one silver lining.  Exactly.  That it's not Schumer.  Hey, is it true that you guys have already called the 2012 election at Fox News and you're 
[00:18:30]  calling Obama losing?  All right, is it true that you know nothing about politics?  Yes, it is.  What do you think?  Obama's done now in 2012?  What's the deep shots?  Here it is.  You avoid my television.  And Norton comes on and Anthony comes on and I say to them, why won't Opie come on?  I'll tell you why.  Because, you know, we were supposed to do dinner many times and you've blown me off.  So I'm supposed to see that beautiful house of yours, you know, on the little island where 
[00:19:00]  you have to give all sorts of IDs and bring your passport just to get through the guard  tower.  I live in a building here in New York.  Yeah, that's the pressure.  Are you married?  Did you get married?  Oh my God, you don't even know the first thing about me.  Well, you had a kid, I heard.  Yeah, I've been married almost two years and my son is almost six months old.  That kid turns out to be exactly like you.  No, I don't think he is.  I don't think he is.  He's already smarter.  Let me ask you, have you noticed, despite this election, that Jim Norton has not been 
[00:19:30]  on your program in a while?  Yeah, actually, I have noticed.  Thank you.  You know, one of the things, I've got to give Norton a lot of credit.  When we first started putting Norton on the program, because over the years I've listened  to your guys' show a lot, although my hours are very different now.  And so, you know, believe it or not, I'm like on an hour and a half sleep and I'm getting  my kids up for school now, which is why I figured I'd call you and then go back to bed.  Wow.  But, Norton, I give you the, I watched him on HBO.  My wife and I were up one night and we were watching your HBO special and we're laughing 
[00:20:00]  our heads off.  Oh, thank you.  And like, you're scheduled to be on the next night.  Oh.  Every other word is a bleepable word.  And I'm saying, oh, no.  I mean, we're laughing, we're enjoying it, and I'm telling my wife, yeah, you see, he's  going to be on the great American panel.  And she goes, good luck.  But, you know what, you always know where the line is and I give you a lot of credit  for it.  And everyone loves having you on because you're really funny. 
[00:20:30]  Thanks.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, you can't go on Fox or any network and be, you know, HBO is one thing.  Yeah, it's just not appropriate.  You know what's good is, and the other thing is, is people have told me about you, Anthony,  is that they just see another side of you.  I guess Opie brings out the worst in you and I kind of bring out the worst.  Yeah, there's something about the atmosphere of the two shows.  They're a lot different.  Well, you know, it's funny because once you start working hard, you know, what do they  say?  If you're 20 and not a liberal, you don't have a heart. 
[00:21:00]  If you're 40 and you're paying taxes and you're not a conservative, you don't have a  brain.  Right.  This is true.  I, I, the, the, one of the biggest issues I have is, uh, is taxes and, uh, the fact  that I pay so much in taxes and then I'm being told it's not enough.  Isn't that amazing?  That is, is, is infuriating.  And then you can't even really argue any point because people just be, well, if you didn't  have it, you wouldn't have to pay it. 
[00:21:30]  And it's like, no, that, that isn't what this is about.  This is about people, it's what you were saying before.  People mistake, um, opportunity for a right.  There's not a right in this country to be wealthy and, and, uh, to prosper and a life,  liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  It's not the right of happiness.  And some people, I'm sorry, they're, they're going to have to work harder than other people.  That's, that's how this country works.  But, but, uh, they've gotten ingrained in their head that it's a, a God given right that if 
[00:22:00]  you're born in this country, you have to, uh, live off of the, the people that have, uh,  made something of themselves.  You know, all of us and, and Norton, you, I know a lot of comics and, uh, I know a lot  of people that have radio stories when, and, and, and, you know, you think back in your  early days, you guys got behind a radio microphone and you fell in love with it.  That's what happened to me.  You know, I was, I was working my way in and out of school and, and I'd go to school and 
[00:22:30]  I'd run out of money and I'd go back to work and I was involved in contracting.  I've done every job there is.  My father worked in restaurants.  You know, I started out as a dishwasher and bus boy and bartender and, and waiter and,  and I've, I've, you know, hung wallpaper and I painted houses and I laid tile and I framed  houses and I, I fell off a roof three stories right on my head.  Fizzy guy.  Yeah.  You know, that's when I was, became a conservative, Opie.  He's obsessed.  But you think, but you first, all you guys, we get behind the microphone for the first time. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  And I, I fell in love with it.  I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.  And I, uh, and I, I worked for a year for free.  My first radio job paid me 19 grand a year.  I've got hired over the phone.  I packed everything in the back of the van and I moved to Huntsville, Alabama.  Wow.  I didn't know that.  And, uh, well, you know, Norton, when you start out in comedy, you know, you go to the,  the worst places.  Yeah.  Um, you, you pay your own way, you get $25 a night. 
[00:23:30]  If you're lucky.  It was a year before my first paid gig a year and it was a $25 gig.  Yeah.  But you did it.  You followed your dream because you know what, this is what you want to do.  You wanted to be on stage.  You want to make people laugh and, and have a good time.  Right.  And this is what America is about.  Now we make those choices in life.  You know, look, there are some people that are going to bed right about now and they've  been up all night and they've been drinking and they've been partying and they're not  going to get up and they're not going to work hard tomorrow.  But there's a mentality among some in this country that they think they've been conditioned 
[00:24:00]  to believe that America should provide them their health care.  If they have kids, their kids ought to get government run daycare.  You know, the rent is too damn high.  You know, some people want, you know, landlords, individuals forced by the power of government  to subsidize their rent.  That's what rent control, rent stabilization in big cities like New York is all about.  And then there are those of us that think, you know what, uh, get up, take care of  your own life.  You live in the greatest, freest country in the world.  Stop expecting other people to do stuff for you. 
[00:24:30]  If you're really sick, if you're elderly, if you're young and disabled, we're willing  to pitch in and help.  But this is not a permanent gig.  You've got to at some point learn how to fish yourself.  Yeah.  What do you think of yourself?  A Republican I have a problem with is Bloomberg in this, because I think, first of all,  I don't think he's a Republican.  Exactly.  He's a very, uh, he just took that because he couldn't get on a Democratic ticket.  How did he get himself exactly a fourth term and then spend a hundred million on the election?  How does that happen?  I'm sorry, third term, sorry. 
[00:25:00]  Now he's advocating that, you know, or, you know, third term, and now he's advocating  everyone only have two terms.  Yeah.  He really is reprehensible.  That passed, by the way, didn't it?  It's only, uh, we're down to two terms again, right?  Well, what did he exactly do?  The last I saw was, I didn't see the final results.  Yeah.  How did that happen?  What exactly did he get passed?  It really makes me hate him.  Just, well, the referendum was, he gets three terms because, you know, New York really needed  him at this time.  Yeah.  Apparently we couldn't survive without him.  But didn't we want Giuliani for a third term? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  I would have taken Giuliani for a third term.  And wasn't he the guy that said, nah, nah, you know, we got term limits.  The system has to work for a reason.  Yeah.  Look, there was, you know, that was actually Washington, George Washington's mentality,  although we did have, you know, FDR, you know, and, yeah, trying to hold the job like  a Pope.  Yeah, pretty much.  That's one way to look at it, Anthony.  Yeah.  The white smoke coming out.  Yeah.  All right.  So now it's back to two terms.  So, uh, it was bad for Rudy to stay in.  What is Giuliani going to do? 
[00:26:00]  I loved him as mayor of New York.  I think he's thinking of running for president.  You know, if you want my list, I think Palin is really considering it.  I think Newt's considering it.  Palente's considering it.  But, um, I would, I would not be surprised.  I think Christie will be considered vice president.  I think Bobby Jindal may not run, but he'd be a great vice president.  I also think one day he could be a great president.  Watching from yesterday's election, Marco Rubio is a rising star in the Republican Party.  He's got one of the most compelling life stories. 
[00:26:30]  Why?  You know, the very things we've just been talking about.  He's a Cuban American.  His family grew up in communism.  He comes to America.  This is the land of hope and opportunity.  I think, I think he's, was saying on the campaign trail, his dad was a bartender.  His mother was a maid.  And, uh, and, you know, he always was brought up to believe you can be anything in America.  And he really articulates conservatism really well.  Uh, did I say Romney?  I think he's going to get in it.  Yeah.  Daniels.  Um, do you think Palin's going to run as, uh, she's going to want to be, uh, a president 
[00:27:00]  or vice president?  You know, well, if she runs, she'll be running for president.  I, I don't think she's made up her mind.  I mean, in the interviews that I've had with her and the time, she's on Hannity tonight.  I'll, I'll, I'm going to ask her, obviously, but, uh, it'll be interesting to see.  I think she's doing a, I think she actually is doing a good job, uh, backing people and,  uh, did a great job influencing, uh, the vote in that way.  And, uh, and watching her on Fox News, she does come off a lot more informed than she 
[00:27:30]  did, um, when she was, uh, uh, on the vice presidential ticket.  She, she absolutely comes off more informed and, and she's speaking a lot better than,  than she did.  Things aren't blindsiding her, uh, like they used to.  Look, I got to know her a little bit and, and I like her, so maybe I'm, I'm defending a  friend here, but, uh, you know, you think back, look, imagine a scenario where it's the  summer before a really important election and, and you're a governor of a small state  and in her case, Alaska, all of a sudden you kind of get picked out of obscurity. 
[00:28:00]  You weren't on everybody's, you know, top one, two, three, four or five in terms of being  picked as VP.  And, uh, you get pulled out of obscurity and you get thrown into the national limelight.  And then, you know, there's Charlie Gibson and Katie Couric and, and they're on a mission  to tear you down.  You got a campaign that's scared to death.  You're going to make a mistake.  And, you know, so, uh, did those governor, did we all doubt that she knew what, uh, what  newspaper she read every day, but she figured, you know, she couldn't win for losing. 
[00:28:30]  If she says the wall street journal, uh, you only read right wing stuff or the New York  post.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a setup, obviously.  She should have just lied and said, I read the New York times and the daily news.  Yeah.  But then they would have, then they would have said to her, who's your favorite columnist?  Or who's your, what'd you, you know, they, they would have hit her some way.  But I, I, I'm, I'm weird with Palin.  I don't, I don't, I would not want to see her as president, but I also think that part  of her popularity is that she really did kind of just kind of come out from obscurity and  the way she got attacked by the left, it was a really weird attack. 
[00:29:00]  Like, what is it with attractive women who are on that side of the coin, who just get  brutalized?  It's a really bizarre dislike of them that people have.  And I think that people who have her ideals have kind of rallied around her because they  feel bad for her.  I think it's deeper than that.  Um, the treatment of conservative women and yeah, okay, so she's good looking, but think  about this, all the things that were said about her, her clothes, her looks, you know, 
[00:29:30]  let's, let's take her out of the equation.  Let's, let's fill in the blank with Michelle Obama or Hillary Clinton or Barbara Boxer,  you know, or Jerry Brown's campaign.  Granted, it was on a cell phone, but somebody in the campaign is calling Meg Whitman a whore.  You got Joy Behar calling Sharon Engel a bitch.  Uh, you know, imagine, all right, we're back to the terrestrial radio.  I mean, you guys can basically get away with whatever you want because you're Opie and  Anthony, uh, you can, but, but honestly, I, I don't need, would you ever call any Democratic 
[00:30:00]  woman a bitch?  No, I, in an interview, no, I would, I wouldn't call any of them that, honestly.  On stage, you might, but.  On stage, yeah, but not in an interview.  On a comedy stage where you, where you're eviscerating everybody.  Right.  Yeah, but that's different.  Right, that's what I'm saying.  During an interview, I wouldn't do it.  No, I am, but, but this happens to conservatives, all conservative women.  And it's like, fair game.  If I, if I called Joy Behar a bitch, I might be fired.  And I, and I've had the discussion even with comics about Palin.  And again, I would, honestly, I wouldn't vote for her. 
[00:30:30]  I don't, I, I would not want to see her be president, but I don't have this visceral  dislike of her either.  And, and I've had guys go like, she's dangerous.  I'm like, she's a conservative lady.  How is she dangerous?  She's just a conservative lady.  That's it.  She's not dangerous.  Let me, let me just point out one thing.  You know, she would vote, she would advocate for lower taxes.  She wouldn't go with this, with ridiculous notion of shutting down Gitmo or, or given,  you know, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a civilian trial. 
[00:31:00]  She wouldn't stop using the term war on terror or, and call the man caused disasters or overseas  contingency operations.  She wouldn't go around the world apologizing for America.  She wouldn't call America arrogant.  She would, she would advocate for limited government, greater freedom, lower taxes, individual  responsibility, a return to those simple constitutional principles.  You know, in, in the minds of a liberal, she's an idiot, but Barack Obama, who has driven  the country into a ditch is a genius. 
[00:31:30]  I don't get it.  I don't think she's, I don't think she's an idiot or, or the, or the person that she's  painted to be by, by the media.  I don't buy that either, but I, I, I do know that she's a, you know, her thing is, look,  she's pro-life, I think.  Right.  That's her thing.  So there's a personal liberty that she would, I think, remove from people.  Again, she's too conservative for me.  She's just, I think she's too religious conservative.  Yeah.  I'll take her over Barack Obama for president.  Oh, I would take that in a heartbeat, please.  Yeah.  Cause you're a happily married man, Sean.  I still need that law on the books. 
[00:32:00]  Which law on the books?  Well, you know, pro-choice.  I'm still running around.  You really want to get into that because, look, first of all, you meet the girl at the  comedy club and she comes up to you, oh, Norton, you're wonderful.  You know, and then you, you start making your smooth moves and, uh, you have a lot of choices  here.  I know.  And I always make bad ones.  You know, how many shots of bourbon are you going to do?  I don't drink.  That's a choice.  I don't drink at all.  Yeah.  Jimmy doesn't drink.  I just take my alcohol money and give it to them. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Get them drunk.  Yeah.  Cause he's so bored with this discussion, but.  No, I went and got breakfast.  What's going on?  All right.  Hi, you're a pisser.  All right.  So, so you make a choice.  You take the girl out to your car, right?  And then you make a choice to start making out with her.  And then you make a choice to, uh, start removing one article of clothing after another.  And then you make a choice that you're going to have sex, you know, and then you don't  use any protection.  Those are a lot of choices there.  That's true.  Sean just gave us a look into his mind.  If you get the girl pregnant, you know what? 
[00:33:00]  I think the baby has a right to live.  Sean, did you used to have sex in cars?  Never.  Yeah.  I don't like the fact that you didn't give me the credit at least for taking her to my  apartment.  Yeah, really?  Kylie's got me as an animal.  Look, you throw her on the hood, you're out there in front of the entire audience.  They're applauding and booing at the same time.  Listen, I want to go right into the main themes that Opie.  I want Opie to be able to join the discussion.  All right, relax.  Relax.  I've had about five dates my whole life.  My wife and I met, and I was in Huntsville, Alabama when I was doing the radio. 
[00:33:30]  And from the day we met to the day we got engaged was three months, and from the day  we met to the day we got married was six.  Wow.  We got married 18 years.  Oh, my God.  Why were you in a hurry?  Because I'm Catholic.  It's either get married or sin.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Oh, wait.  You're one of those guys?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  I didn't know that.  What does that mean, one of them?  Well, don't you want to try it out a little bit first?  Those days I don't talk about anymore.  But, I mean, logically, wouldn't you want to try it out first?  You know, it's the old kick the tires argument. 
[00:34:00]  Mm-hmm.  I didn't need to.  She was great.  Well, for 18 years, obviously, it was the right move.  Something's working.  Something's working.  Yeah, we get along pretty good.  I'll be respectful.  I'm too indecisive.  Yeah.  She doesn't do what?  I'm too indecisive to do that, to make that kind of – I think my demons go too far in  one direction to make that kind of –  Sean, do you think it's bad to have sex out of marriage, though?  You know, look, I'm a Christian, so, you know, what my personal belief is is that marriage 
[00:34:30]  is sacred and you should wait until you get married.  Do I think most people live up to that standard?  No.  I'm pretty realistic about it, nor do I think I should impose my values on anybody else.  But do you understand why people don't wait?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, right.  Of course.  All right.  He's on the second date.  He's looking for a chapel.  He gets it.  He's laying down the aisle with, you know, Nike sneakers on saying, yes, I do.  How about gay marriage? 
[00:35:00]  Are you completely against that?  I'm against – I don't think we should define or redefine marriage.  Look, this is where I am fairly libertarian in this way.  I wouldn't change – I don't think we need to change the definition of marriage or what  the traditional definition is.  But what people, adults do in the privacy of their own bedroom is none of my business,  period.  I don't care.  You know, I just don't care what people do.  And why won't a lot of the, I guess, the farther-right conservatives kind of – I guess 
[00:35:30]  they're religiously influenced or whatever, but again, that's where they lose me a lot.  It's like they talk a lot about personal freedoms and the government not intruding, but they're  very comfortable with the government intruding there.  Or they're very comfortable with the government intruding on the issues that they feel are  important.  And the liberals are also very comfortable with the government intruding on things that  they feel are important.  It's like kind of both sides, I feel, balance each other out that way.  I think the most intolerant is the left, and especially when it comes to freedom of speech 
[00:36:00]  or people that they don't like or imposing values like – you know, every time they tax  us to impose values, they've got this system or this value system that they think is superior.  And that's that, you know, we have a role in society to take care of the less fortunate  among us, and so what they're going to do is force their morality on everybody by taking  other people's money, or else they're going to take you out in handcuffs and off to jail,  and they think it's superior.  But, you know, if liberals are so generous, why don't they spend their own money in their 
[00:36:30]  cause?  Now, as it relates to the conservatives, you know, why does society have to change its  definition of marriage to accommodate a lifestyle choice of other people?  I would agree with that.  Why do people need the rest of society's approval?  Because the – I think because society's – again, to play devil's advocate, I think  society's definition of something is exclusionary of certain groups who are kind of sick and  tired of being excluded, meaning they feel it's an unfair definition, and if society has 
[00:37:00]  an unfair definition, they probably want to change.  If it takes a male and a female to produce a child, would you disagree with me that a mother  offers certain things to a child, and a father offers certain things to a child that neither  one could offer?  I don't know.  Like, a mom has a way to nurture kids that the father may not have.  A father has a way to really instill strength and discipline in their kids in a way that nobody 
[00:37:30]  else can.  So if it takes a man and a woman to make a child, and we agree that men and women bring  different things in terms of nurturing a child, then how do you make the argument that  it's okay for gay and lesbian couples to adopt?  Wow, Sean, I mean, in a – your definition works in a perfect world, but there's a lot  of shitty fucking mothers out there.  A lot of bad parents.  What are you talking about?  Boy, gee, did you – what happened when you grew up?  What?  There was an intensity behind that. 
[00:38:00]  No, because it's funny.  Because that's just –  You saw that coming.  Because that's just ridiculous.  It really is.  I mean, there's a lot of crap –  What's ridiculous about it?  There's a lot of crappy parents out there where maybe the kid would be better off with  two moms or two dads.  I'm just saying – and again, I'm asking –  You're absolutely right in a perfect world, but we don't live in a perfect world.  The thing I have an issue with is if it's about a mother – because we're defining  marriage.  So if it's basically a mother and a father to create a child, that's like saying, well, 
[00:38:30]  let's just say that they can't have kids.  So then that part of what they could do is removed, but they're still allowed to be  married.  So you can't even base it to me on children, because let's just say that the father or the  mother is unable to – or the male or the female is unable to have kids.  So to me, the marriage shouldn't be based in the idea of children.  All right, but let's just assume for a moment, you know, would any kid choose to – and  my 12-year-old son just walked into the room here.  I've got to watch myself.  And it's his birthday today. 
[00:39:00]  Say hi to Opie and Anthony.  Say hi.  Hello.  Happy birthday.  If you go downstairs, I'll meet you down there.  I'm going to give you a birthday present in two minutes, okay?  I promise.  I wonder what that is.  I'll tell you what it is as soon as he leaves.  Yeah.  All right.  I hope it's something fun.  What do you think Sean gets his son?  I hope it's not O'Reilly's book.  I hope it's something fun.  A nice .22 rifle.  I'll tell you what I got him.  I got him on – because he's like me.  I used to open every Christmas.  I want to see if Sean's a good dad or not.  This is going to say a lot.  I got him an iPad, and he's wanted his cell phone for the first time, so I got him. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  Yeah.  You're a solid dad.  Sean's a good and rich dad.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  You're very –  You have great gifts.  That's what you want.  That's pretty good.  All right.  So now, what was I going to say?  All right.  But again, I want you to realize I don't really care what people do, but it would – with  a lot of kids, knowing maybe society's views on issues, is it ideal for kids to grow up  with two mommies or two daddies?  Maybe not.  I honestly – I don't know if there's enough history to show, but it's like the same argument 
[00:40:00]  could be made if we're not 100% sure on interracial couples.  A lot of people find that, even though it's a male and a female, to be morally reprehensible.  A lot of people would even use the argument that God doesn't like it, and that would  be used to –  Who would use that argument?  A lot of people.  A lot of people who are racist.  A lot of people.  I think you're looking a little more old school.  Maybe old school, but people who don't like it would use that argument to back up their  argument, because most people don't just say, I don't like something you can't do.  It's just a kind of reason for it.  I'm going to be perfectly honest.  I think discrimination is horrible.  I really – I've got to go back to this main argument here, is that I'm libertarian. 
[00:40:30]  Here's what I don't understand.  Why are so many people obsessed with, worried what other people in society think?  If you want to live with somebody, if you want to sleep with somebody, and you're an  adult, I don't see people knocking on your door and saying, who are you sleeping with?  I don't think – you know what?  I think most people, if we get down to the absolute truth, most people are so wrapped  up in themselves, they don't care.  We all have this notion in life that everybody else is watching us, when in reality they're 
[00:41:00]  not.  And as far as the definition, Sean, I think we redefine things a lot as to what we find  offensive or what's appropriate, and I think that that stuff kind of is changing.  And again, I use race as an example only because it's something that at one point was so frowned  upon in this country.  And now if you look at an interracial couple and go, well, they shouldn't have children,  people would go, well, you're out of your mind.  Why not?  But 50 years ago, people would have said, oh, they shouldn't have kids.  It's bad for the kids.  The kids shouldn't be raised in that environment.  So I honestly don't know if it's bad for a kid to have two mothers, but I'm kind of 
[00:41:30]  tired of people enforcing their morality on gay people and making them behave a certain way.  Now here's another – I'll take it to another level here, just for Opie's sake.  You know, what about all religious people?  You may not agree with them, but we believe they have their right to raise their children  the way they see fit, right?  Yeah, yes, of course.  All right, so I'm a Christian in my life, and my faith tells me that either sex before  marriage is a sin or that gay relations is sinful, okay? 
[00:42:00]  And let's say I want to instill those values in my children.  Sure.  And so I pay for these public schools, I send my kids off to school, and then they  go to school, and the values I'm instilling in my kids get contradicted by liberal teachers  that say – you know, remember there was a controversy back in New York, you know,  some years ago where they were giving young kids first, second, or third grade, Heather  has two mommies and two roommates.  Does the educational system and the government have the right to contradict the values of the 
[00:42:30]  parent because they don't like their Christian values?  Whatever happened to freedom of religion?  I agree with you on that, but again, the same argument could be made for, say, Muslims  who believe in Sharia law, and they could say, well, they're showing us that boys and  girls are equal, and we don't believe that in this house.  We believe that a girl should have a veil on or should be forced to wear a burqa, and  here they are allowing them to run – it's like religious stuff should be much more  concentrated on in the home because I think that there's so many different religions  that any public school cannot –  That means a public school should just stay out of it. 
[00:43:00]  First of all, these kids can't read, write, or do math.  So if we focused on that, we wouldn't have a veil on it.  Well, they may not – I agree with you, but they may not be looking at this Heather  has two mommies as a religious issue.  You know, they may not be looking at it that way.  I think the schools have gotten way too involved in people's lives.  Yeah.  Instead of just teaching their kids, they're now trying to instill, yeah, some type of  their own liberal morality into them instead of just teaching them, which is ridiculous.  I think in an ideal world, you know, people, you know, want to have their own commitment 
[00:43:30]  ceremony and whatever.  That's fine.  I don't think they need society sanctioning.  I don't think – you know, it gets complicated after a while.  It really does.  No, go ahead.  Can we talk about Obama's defeat?  I did want to go back to that because wasn't it just –  I've got to go be a good father here.  Wasn't it just amazing to see the man that, you know, was changing and wasn't going to  be politics as usual and was going to be transparent just doing exactly the same thing you've seen 
[00:44:00]  Democrats do over and over again, and even Republicans, just seeing them even backed into a corner  and just started bashing the GOP?  Well, I think it's worse.  I think – look, one of the things people were telling me, you know, when I first started  really looking into Obama and his background, you know, I got pretty fascinated pretty fast.  And, you know, all of a sudden I find that he hangs out with this guy, Jeremiah Wright. 
[00:44:30]  You know, I interviewed Jeremiah Wright.  It was the last interview he gave before the election of Obama.  I interviewed him in March of 2007 before the election in 2008.  And in that interview, I started going through what he called black liberation theology, you know,  and you can look it up, and it's pretty radical.  And by the way, its roots are in communism redistribution and, you know, for the black family, 
[00:45:00]  the black community, the black this.  I said, now, Reverend, if you change the word black with white, wouldn't a lot of people  view that as racist?  And he got angry, and we started having a big argument on the TV show, and he never showed  up on TV again after that.  And then you find out, well, the president sits on boards with and gives speeches with,  you know, a guy by the name of Bill Ayers, a guy that was part of the Weather Underground,  a group that blew up the Pentagon, the U.S. Capitol, and New York City Police Headquarters.  And I'm like, why would the president be sitting on a board with, giving speeches with a guy 
[00:45:30]  with that radical background?  And then you dig a little deeper, and you're hanging out with this guy, Father Flager,  and this other guy, Tony Resco, and there's this other corrupt deal, and he worked with  this group, Acorn, and he, you know, was teaching rules for radicals.  And, you know, you find a very radical president, and what's amazing to me is if you look at  Barack Obama, the only thing he knows is his radicalism.  His, you know, he ran a really effective communication operation in 2008, and what we've learned in 
[00:46:00]  this election cycle is, you know, you can read your teleprompter when you're running for  president, you can make all sorts of promises, and you can hire somebody to write these lofty  speeches, but eventually you're going to have to run on your record.  And then when he had an opportunity to govern, I think the real story out of this is America  is rejected Obama's radicalism.  Yeah, they did, and obviously that came out last night.  People not happy with the past two years, and they're going to talk about change. 
[00:46:30]  Wow, that's the biggest change in 70 years.  All right, now we're going to give the show back to Opie.  Oh, relax.  How did you celebrate the big victory last night?  Did you crack a beer or something?  No, but I'll talk about it.  How does Sean Hannity get loose when something like what happened last night happens?  It's funny, because I drink like two or three drinks, and I got this dumb, stupid, you know,  Irish grin on my face, and I can't drink a lot.  Oh, God. 
[00:47:00]  You don't drunk Twitter, do you?  That'd be funny.  Hannity drunk Twitter.  I'd better not hang out with Anthony, then, man.  You'd be in deep trouble.  I love my Twitters.  And beers.  That's what I was getting.  And beers.  Huh?  Are you Twittering all the time, Anthony?  Not all the time.  Last night I was a lot.  Yeah, I was, you know.  And goes through stages.  Opie, did you, honestly, did you even watch last night?  Yeah, I watched a bit.  I watched a little bit.  I just think it's all horseshit in the end.  You don't, you don't.  How much money, how much money would I save if the Democrats ran everything? 
[00:47:30]  You wouldn't.  I mean, the Republicans.  I mean, the Republicans.  I'm sorry.  You know, in an ideal world, you know, I'll tell you how dramatic it was when Reagan was  president.  I mean, the top marginal rates, believe it or not, when he was, when he came into office  after Jimmy Carter's disaster was 70 percent, and he dropped it to 28 percent.  Wow.  So, you know, if you look at the top marginal rates now, if you live in New York, for example,  it's going up to 39 point, what, 5 percent.  Yeah, watch what happens after January 1st. 
[00:48:00]  But think about this.  Then you've got 10 percent state income tax, or 9 percent state income tax on top of it.  If you own a property, you've got property tax.  Sean, Sean, I understand that.  I'm not as stupid as you think.  I know the taxes are completely out of control.  I want to know how much it drops if the Republicans ran everything.  I think if they dropped it in the right way that would stimulate the economy, I think  they could increase their revenues and drop it 15 percent.  Here's one thing we ought to agree on.  If you work your entire life, you know, you've got a kid now, so you're a dad, and I assume 
[00:48:30]  your perspective is changing a little.  That's what happened to me 12 years ago.  My son was born on Election Day, 1998.  Of course he was.  How crazy is that?  Of course he was.  It was not planned.  My son was born on Mother's Day, so there you go.  Okay.  And I had a lunatic for a mother, so.  There you go.  Yeah, exactly.  So it does work out in the end.  And I forgot the point I was going to make.  Yeah, good.  That was my point.  Wait, no, 15 percent tax is probably dropping. 
[00:49:00]  And your perspective changing, yes.  Yeah, you know, here's the, let's say you work your whole life, and you make all this  money in radio, and you put your money away, and throughout those years you're a good  little liberal, and you're a good citizen, and you pay back all, you pay all your money  in taxes, you have an account, and you do it right.  And then let's say you croak.  If you die on December 31st this year, you pay zero in a death tax.  If you die January 1, 55 percent of your estate goes to the government after you paid money 
[00:49:30]  on all that money.  Isn't that amazing?  That's sickening.  I think that's very healthy for my son.  Healthy for your son?  My dad died.  He didn't even have a thousand bucks in the bank for me.  Oh, God.  Why would you want to perpetuate that then?  Let my son work it out.  Like you, my first radio job is $12,000.  Wow, you were overpaid.  No, obviously, that's insane.  Obviously.  All right, well, that would be one that the Republicans want to eliminate the debt tax. 
[00:50:00]  So we'll get rid of that.  Well, let's say you risk money.  I know Anthony's into the stock market, and he invests money, and he...  Yeah.  It's called the casino, sir.  Yeah.  By the way, I hang out with Anthony in the casino.  I do like to play.  That is fun.  That might be against your Christian values, no?  No, and I'm not betting my milk money away.  I mean, I get paid a decent salary now.  That's where you see Hannity flipping the table and walking away.  There's got to be one place where you just go ballistic.  It's probably the casino. 
[00:50:30]  No, I'm sitting there with Mark Levin.  We could actually sit there for hours and just play blackjack.  I'm obsessed with Sean.  Like, what is the craziest thing you do?  Like, do you get wild ever, Sean?  At this point in my life?  Did you ever, though?  I don't even think you ever did.  I'm 48 years old.  I'm getting, you know, I'm not...  That's not old.  You know, I'll tell you what I do.  I work hard.  I've got a lot of hours that I put in.  But I honestly, every spare moment I have, I spend with my family.  I've gotten off the road a lot in the last number of years. 
[00:51:00]  I mean, for a while, I was traveling a lot.  And I'm not writing as much as I used to.  I wrote my last book this year.  I'm not writing anymore.  And I spend all my free time with my kids.  My kids are very competitive tennis players.  So I travel.  They do some national tournaments.  I travel around the country.  They're good, huh?  They're good.  They're pretty good.  That's where we agree.  I mean, I'm all about family now, but...  Yeah.  That's what matters.  All right, guys.  I've got to run.  I really enjoyed it and continued success.  It's always good to talk to you.  And Anthony, I want to... 
[00:51:30]  Opie, I want to promise.  How about if I brought...  We did the Opie and Anthony Great American Panel one day.  That'd be cool.  That'd be cool.  Then it's you and Ant beating me up.  Get the hell out of here.  You wouldn't even come to that.  Huh?  First of all, you're pretty good.  You just come in with a couple of lines.  Slap me in the head if I get out of line.  I used to beat up your old partner there live on the show.  Combs.  I actually said live on the show once, Combs piped in.  I go, wow, he actually talks.  He gave me the look of death. 
[00:52:00]  We were actually on Jon Stewart once.  And so Jon's talking to Alan for about five minutes.  I didn't say a word.  I say one word.  And he goes, do you ever let him talk?  I was like, okay, I'm losing this battle.  I'm going to shut up.  Hey, Sean, you know we love you.  I don't agree with everything you say, but I love you.  And I appreciate that you stick up for us every single time.  Listen, you guys are radio legends.  And you know what?  A lot of us that are infamous.  Oh, my God. 
[00:52:30]  You are a prick, man.  That wasn't me.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what happened.  That was a mistake.  Oh, God.  What an ass.  He's probably sitting there laughing and falls off.  That'll be that prick.  Oh, God.  A lot of people are upset that it was a one-sided conversation.  Why?  But he was...  We agree with something.  What do you want?  I can't represent.  I agree with him. 
[00:53:00]  What?  I can't represent the Democrat.  I'm not a Democrat either.  I...  What?  I agree with the guy.  What am I supposed to do?  A lot of people are saying one-sided, one-sided.  Who gives a shit?  One-sided.  Good.  One-sided.  Good.  One-sided.  Good.  I talked about what I wanted to talk about.  Yeah.  One-sided.  Good.  It's one-sided.  Go fuck yourself.  Go listen to a fucking one of the liberal shit fucking talk shows if you want the other  side.  Go listen to them crying, crying in their coffee this morning.  One-sided. 
[00:53:30]  That's what you get, though, with the political stuff.  Good.  I like Sean.  I hate...  I never understand people...  I get people who don't like him.  He's too conservative.  But I never understand guys that attack him.  It's like, I always thought he was pretty fair.  Yeah.  I don't think he's that unreasonable.  I like Sean.  At all.  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  Do you think he wants to be a Christian?  Yeah.  I think he definitely enjoys the whole family thing.  Was he brought up that way?  Yeah.  You could...  The family lifestyle.  You could be a family guy without being Christian.  No, no.  I mean, I don't think he was...  Hardcore Christian.  I don't even know if he was brought up that way, or that's just the life he chose, or whatever, 
[00:54:00]  but...  You think he's only had sex with his wife?  I don't...  I don't...  I didn't want to ask him that.  Nah, probably don't want to get in there...  You think he had a few before?  Speculate about Sean's...  Why?  It's a part of what he is.  He's a good Christian guy.  I would guess as a younger guy, growing up, you go to college, whatever...  It's his private life.  You sure?  Yeah, I'm guessing.  Could be.  Could be.  Yeah.  Yeah, could be.  Who knows?  We should take a break.  He's also, you know, a guy's known to go down to the range and blast off a few rounds. 
[00:54:30]  He's armed, right?  Like that.  He's got to be armed.  It's been in the papers and stuff.  Yeah, he's a marksman, too.  He's very good.  Oh, really?  So why don't you guys go shoot guns together?  We will.  Me and him are supposed to do dinner.  Sean's a busy guy.  I'll tell you why I can't hate Sean Hannity.  I don't hate him.  I don't know what I'm even saying.  But when we got in trouble the last time, he called me personally and said,  you guys got to just knock it off.  You got to just fucking knock it off. 
[00:55:00]  Just knock it off.  What are you doing?  He really likes us.  I know.  He likes our show.  He likes what we're doing, I guess.  And he actually called me and said, what are you guys doing?  You really got to just stop.  Yeah.  And I actually listened to him.  Like, yeah, maybe we're just always out of control.  He's the example I always use is one of the only guys who has been very, very vocal about sticking up for this.  Like, the guy who's that conservative and religious is sticking up for this fucking piggish show.  This piggish show.  But I respect that. 
[00:55:30]  And all these progressives out there, all you free thinkers, and I don't mean the fans.  Yeah.  But I mean people in positions of power or pundits.  Look what Oberyn did.  A flaming liberal.  And look what he did.  He couldn't wait to see somebody go for what they said.  Yeah, and he was one of the only ones in the mainstream media that stuck up for Imus.  Yes.  I can't think of another guy that really came out and stuck up for Imus.  McCain and Giuliani, after he apologized, after Imus apologized, they said, yeah, I'd go back on a show.  He said he was sorry, and that's that.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  But as far as, yeah, whatever. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  Hey, so we got Boner's acceptance speech there.  Boehner.  Boehner.  Yes.  Boehner.  Boehner.  Whatever.  Did he have a little bit of a breakdown?  He got a little emotion.  So when we take a break, we'll get into that.  A little emotional.  And speaking of language, the situation, I had to apologize.  Wait till you hear this one, Jimmy.  Wait till you hear this one.  For what?  His life?  He should be apologizing for that.  For fucking wasting everyone's time? 
[00:56:30]  He's the one on the show I like the most, because he's the guy that's going to, he'll make millions out of that show.  Where Snooki will always be some kind of a weird joke.  Yeah, like some kind of a, what did she do now?  Well, you know, she's running around with a log of shit in her shoe.  You know, something weird.  I don't see him having any longevity.  Are you going to take him on when he comes in here on Friday?  I think, no, what am I going to do that for?  Yeah.  He'll be a guest on our show, and I'll talk to him.  He's the guy who gets laid a lot.  Good abs.  I just think he doesn't have a longevity where he's going to be able to pound this into a career. 
[00:57:00]  Look at Eric Nise.  Was that his name?  Yeah.  He was the guy from the real world, season one, and he had a career.  He went on MTV.  He was hosting a few shows, and he was the standout, in shape guy.  And after a while, they just kind of toss you to the side.  I think you're right.  I don't think any of them will have a career.  Eric Nise, or whatever it was.  Although, the situation already did dance with the stars.  Dude, I wouldn't have thought so after season one, but after season two, it's a little bit different.  But it's like dancing with the stars. 
[00:57:30]  All those things doesn't mean you've made it in today's world.  They throw everyone on these crappy, shitty, friggin' reality garbage programs.  No, but making it, all we're saying is make it an entertainment.  He's sort of made it past Jersey Shore by doing that show.  Making it past the point of 15 minutes.  I don't think he's going to have longevity.  But that doesn't matter.  Like, Dancing with the Stars is just like if he didn't do Dancing with the Stars, if you ask me.  It's nothing.  Or then he could go on another fucking show. 
[00:58:00]  Let him go on a fucking crabbing boat.  And he could be on Deadliest Catch.  Well, that's what they're doing with the characters.  Because Snooki's going to be on Cake Boss.  Big episode, I think Monday.  Snooki on Cake Boss.  Most of those guys, like Jeff Ross did Dancing with the Stars.  Did he get anything out of that?  He does roasts for them.  It pushed him higher up in the public eye.  Yeah.  But most people, they get like Liddell.  They get these weird pop culture figures who everybody knows.  It's like, they get people who are already pretty well-known and pretty famous in pop culture. 
[00:58:30]  I just see them like, like the interest these days.  People's interest change so quickly.  Like the wind.  Yes.  We'll be interested in, you know, Jersey Shore.  And then within a few months or a year, it's just, you're done.  I think Jersey Shore has one more year tops.  It peaks.  And then it's done.  And then they all go away, except for maybe one or two that will last a little longer.  And then they'll fade out.  There's so many of those.  There's so many of these fucking things on the air now that we just, our attention span 
[00:59:00]  can't sit there and dwell on one thing long.  And support all these people.  No.  You just want to, you go to the next thing.  And the next group of assholes.  The next group of freaks.  The next group of friggin'.  But Jersey Shore is a phenomenon.  Yeah, it really is.  I don't know why, because I've been watching a lot lately, because I'm like, if we're going  to have him in, I might as well watch the fucking show.  And that's the real reason, because I didn't even watch the whole first season.  Flava Flav's show was a phenomenon. 
[00:59:30]  I understand.  And he was really popular for five years.  That wasn't five years, Ron.  He did two or three of them, man.  Yeah, two or three.  And then after that, he had a little success.  Two or three seasons on MTV, or those things, isn't even a real season.  Flav was already famous, though, by that time.  He had, yeah.  I'm not saying the situation's going to go into movies and be a blockbuster star, but  he's going to be able to keep the fame going a little longer than the rest of them.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah, I think you're underestimating how big that show is.  I think once the show's done, which will be a lot sooner than everybody thinks, he's 
[01:00:00]  done with the rest of them.  They're all just gone.  I don't know, man.  I think they're all gone.  I don't think he's got anything after this show.  He's got a workout tape, dumb stuff like that.  Yeah, I think he's a guy that will keep some kind of longevity just because he hasn't made  the ass of himself.  Snooki has just kind of seen as somebody who's a fall-down drunk.  He's looked at as a dumb guinea fucking, just that, hey, look at my abs.  He's known for his abs. 
[01:00:30]  Gives a shit.  I would love to.  So am I, but for the wrong reasons.  I've been known for my abs for years, thanks to Jim Norton, and I never had an ab in my  life.  Yes, you did.  I never had one.  Dude, I'm looking at eight of them right now, and that little V pointing to what a lot  of people might call the promised land.  I wouldn't call it that.  If I had a dime for every fan that said, hey, what happened to your abs?  I'm like, idiot.  That was Jimmy.  I never had them.  Fucking asshole.  Talking about my V.  I never had close to a V.  My I should do.  Oh, God.  You set me up so bad out there. 
[01:01:00]  Well, you can bring this up with the situation on Friday.  Yeah.  Ask him what he thinks happens next.  All right.  That's a good question.  It's not a bad idea, right?  Yeah.  But he's in trouble, and I stick up for the situation today, because wait till you hear  what he got in trouble for.  It's ridiculous what's going on out there.  Re-fucking-diculous.  I almost tried to plug something before I forget, because I'll forget.  Oh, Allah.  November 1920, I'll be back in Poughkeepsie, Bananas Comedy Club. 
[01:01:30]  Uh, Friday, Saturday, November 19th and 20th.  Uh, I've been forgetting to plug that, so come on out.  Nanners.  Nanners in Poughkeepsie.  What did Iraq just say in the middle of that plug in my ear?  Oh.  Probably I'm hungry.  What?  Well, you see, I said piece of bananas.  He goes, are we giving out splits?  No.  Stupid.  It's a club.  He wants to play something.  All right.  That's fine.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Probably spin the bottle with all of us.  With his asshole.  Queer.  By the way, we got a really busy show.  Yeah, Jason Schwartzman is $7.45.  We got him, I think, for 20 minutes.  From Horde to Death, right? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, and I Heart Huckabees and Rushmore.  Yeah, a million things.  I loved Rushmore.  Yeah, he's great.  Fucking, I don't know why I loved that movie, but I loved it with Bill Murray and, anyway.  And then Patrice O'Neill's coming in.  Bobby Lee, the return of fucking psycho Bobby Lee.  That psychopath will be in today.  Pretty crazy guy.  Sean Hannity was scheduled at 8.30, I guess, so.  Wow, he couldn't wait to call us this morning.  He's smart.  He got in early.  He knows he's up and he wants to go back to bed, give his kid his present.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, play what you're going to play, you rock.  Time is running out.  Tick tock!  The American middle class is shrinking every day.  You know, the people that are hard-pressed, we have to help bring them up.  These economic challenges call for strong leadership, but not everyone agrees.  Some people are starting to go like, hmm, does this guy know what the fuck he's doing?  Senator Nagel says, Anthony Cumia is the Antichrist.  Of course.  Chairman Teff says, Cumia will destroy us all. 
[01:03:00]  Nope.  Chief Justice Roberts proclaims, Cumia will wipe his ass with the Constitution.  Enough already.  Wise, benevolent, and even-tempered, Anthony Cumia has the solution to our nation's economic crisis.  Just tax the shit out of everybody.  Liberal-minded philanthropist Anthony Cumia will restore balance to our nation.  It is like the old communist method of everybody gets a piece of the pie.  Say no to discretionary income.  Say yes to a mountain of costly social services. 
[01:03:30]  This fall, vote for Anthony Cumia.  That's what I am.  Tax and spend Democrat.  You got it.  Paid for by the United Negro College Fund in cooperation with the NAACP.  Yay!  And now, this is the Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  It's time to beat that beat up.  Beat that beat up.  Beat that beat up.  Beat that beat up.  Come on.  Beat that beat up.  Beat that beat up. 
[01:04:00]  Is this the Jersey Shore song?  I guess so.  At the boy, Ant.  I'm going to...  I'm fist pumping.  I see that.  You were fist pumping all night long.  Yeah.  On my cock.  I get it.  It was a big night for Anthony.  Very, very excited.  Right in.  Well, it was a very exciting midterm election to watch the Republicans just pretty much sweep  the House.  Sweep the House.  Nancy Pelosi, goodbye.  Goodbye as Speaker of the House. 
[01:04:30]  No more looking at her behind Obama with her dumb big gavel.  She could take her gavel now and shove it.  Go back to Frisco.  You're painting the ass.  I would have liked to have seen Harry Reid get thrown the fuck out of Vegas to have  the daily double with those two, but...  Yeah, we can...  Wow.  What was that, Tom Cruise?  Dude, I literally could not sleep last night.  Yeah, I saw this too.  I didn't...  Wow.  I kept thinking about these images.  Is that building in Dubai?  It's in Dubai. 
[01:05:00]  It's 2,700 feet, but that's the top of the radio tower.  Right.  We've been hearing this for years, but Tom Cruise does his own stunts in his movies, and he  went over the top for his latest movie.  He's hanging off the side of a building in Dubai, and you're saying that that's higher  than the World Trade Center?  Where Tom was.  They said he was about right around the observation deck, which would be 124 stories.  What dot is he on the left side there, Danny?  That's him right there, hanging off of the...  No, I see it on the right, but I'm trying to figure it out on the left.  No, on the left.  That's him right there.  Like where?  There's a... 
[01:05:30]  Right about there?  Okay.  Wow.  There's a helicopter.  Let me see if you see...  Is it on TMZ if you want to check it out?  Yeah, you can see Tom Cruise hanging off the side of the building for his...  A hundred...  Badass, I guess.  ...and 24 stories.  So basically, the World Trade Center was 110, so this is 150 feet higher or so than the top  of the World Trade Center he was.  Can you do that?  Let's see.  Do you understand?  I couldn't sleep.  My palms were clammy, and I just kept thinking...  It was cum. 
[01:06:00]  No, that would be my face was clammy.  But I just...  Because he's doing a stunt with another guy where there's a photo of him running.  Like he's harnessed in and he's running on the side of the building like Batman used  to do across the face of the building.  And I just kept thinking of the horror of falling.  And I literally got an hour of sleep last night because of those fucking pictures.  They ruined my night.  Really?  They ruined my night.  I couldn't do it.  I would love to sit here and say I could do something like that.  I don't think I could do that. 
[01:06:30]  Nah, it's crazy stuff.  Do you ever think dumb stuff...  Like, you know, you see this long hallway right here that we always talk about or haven't  talked about in a while, but we have?  Yeah.  Now, that hallway, you can walk right down the middle of it, think nothing of it, right?  Yeah.  You could do it all day long and not even think that you're walking down the hallway.  Which some people do.  That's all they do, actually.  Yeah, exactly.  Half this place, that's all they do.  And then you take that hallway and you put it 1,500 feet in the fucking air with nothing on  the sides and it becomes a completely different walk.  You'd be out of your mind, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, you could run down that hallway. 
[01:07:00]  But if it was up in the air, 1,500 feet with nothing on the sides...  You'd be like all...  You would crawl from here to our office.  And you'd still be scared shit that you would fall off the edges.  Yeah, why is that?  I don't know.  Or when I'm riding my bike on a dumb bike path that might be, I don't know, three feet  wide.  You're not even close to hitting the grass or anything.  And I just think, really quickly, if this was in the air, I wouldn't be able to keep  the bike on the trail.  You'd pedal right over the edge.  What is that?  I don't know.  It fucks you up.  Your whole visual thing is all...  It's just too big. 
[01:07:30]  It's too much for your brain to handle.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, put a sidewalk way up a few hundred stories.  And you'd have people falling off the sidewalk all day long.  Yeah, you wouldn't be able to...  And there's not one person that walks off the curb unless they're drunk or something,  right?  But normal people, if they had to do that 1,500 feet in the air, they would fucking plummet.  I wonder what the actual science is behind that.  I would love to know what that's about.  I bet somebody knows.  And I'm not talking...  Oh, the visual. 
[01:08:00]  Something about the vision and the inner ear.  Combine it together.  Yeah, it's the fluid on the inner ear, which determines balance and direction.  When you take that and you have...  You combine that with vertigo and it can be a problem when there's seepage of the inner  ear fluid.  Getting back to the top of the cruise thing. 
[01:08:30]  2,700 feet in the air, Jimmy.  Yeah, he wasn't.  He was about...  Oh, the building's 2,700 feet?  He was two-thirds of the way up.  Okay, listen, that doesn't bother me as much as that French douche.  Of course, he's not harnessed in.  What the fuck was his name again?  His name is Alain Robert.  No, no, no.  The French guy was...  No, I'm talking about Philippe.  Philippe Petit, I think.  Petit.  Philippe Petit.  When he had the high wire across the Twin Towers and then he laid down on the wire in the  middle, that's what horrifies me. 
[01:09:00]  I'm like, how the fuck do you do that as a human being?  Yeah, that's crazy stuff.  Even the guy that climbs the buildings, Jimmy, is not as bad as the Philippe Petit laying  down in the middle of the Twin Towers.  That is the craziest thing I've ever seen.  It is, right?  Yeah.  By far.  I'm so bummed there's no real video of that event.  The weird thing is, I guarantee you there's some footage of this.  They said that there was a helicopter 10 feet from the building.  I don't see how to film the action.  Wow.  That's crazy.  I would love to know how they did it because it's all glass.  How they did it without the reflections wrecking the shot. 
[01:09:30]  It's the angle they shoot it.  That's still very impressive.  Yeah, you just shoot it on like a 45 degree angle.  How do people live?  It's 181 floors high and there's apartments and residences, you know, multi-million dollar  places.  But what do you do in a case of a fire?  My girlfriend laughed at me because when I was shopping for apartments a few years ago,  I wanted to get a place.  I was like, if I live on the 60th floor, which I wanted to, because I would love to live that  high, I would love to be that high up, but I wanted to buy a parachute in case there was  a fire.  Oh, one of those parachute things they were selling? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, a fucking parachute.  It's not a dumb idea.  No, but she called me a total dork.  That would be hysterical.  It's not a dumb idea.  It's not even a fire.  You jump out.  It slams you against the building.  Exactly.  Somebody's smoking next door.  You plummet to your death.  Yeah, he fell down.  Didn't have to.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, so we got to play the Boehner thing because I hear he does a little Mike Schmidt action.  Well, he got choked up.  I thought it was going to be worse.  You could hear.  He really has to pull himself together.  Pull yourself together. 
[01:10:30]  You're going to act like a man.  You want to hear this thing?  Let's get into this.  Listen, I hold these values dear because I've lived them.  I've spent my whole life chasing the American dream.  Oh, that applause saved his ass.  They saved him.  Yeah, they saved him.  That applause saved his ass.  They saved him. 
[01:11:00]  Did he have two bad knees when he was coming up?  I had two bad knees.  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  What happened?  What happened then?  I beg God that the dream came true.  Okay, fuck it.  The true is the best one. 
[01:11:30]  The true is the best one.  It's all high and cry.  By the way, just look over.  That's the footage.  Yeah.  Oh, you got the actual footage.  Oh, wow.  He's running across the side.  It's on YouTube for the people that want to check it out.  Running across the fucking face.  You think they just tied a rope around him?  Dude, the insurance for that.  Listen, one of our biggest stars wants to run along glass at 1,500 feet.  How much is that going to cost us in insurance?  Holy fuck.  Unbelievable.  He's Scientologist, though, so he can't die.  That's true. 
[01:12:00]  They're immortal, aren't they?  The aliens will save him.  Yeah, he's got like thetans or something.  What balls that guy has, man.  Banner continues here.  USA!  Listen, a lot of you know I started out mopping floors, waiting tables, and tending bar at  my dad's cavern.  I put myself through school, working every rotten job there was.  And every night shift I could find. 
[01:12:30]  And I poured my heart and soul into running a small business.  Banner business.  Banner business.  And running a small business.  I heard that.  He gave up.  Banner business.  Oh, yeah.  Right on, Hoffman in Virginia.  It's still real to him, damn it.  Yeah.  He got a little choked up.  Have we played wrestling fanboy lately? 
[01:13:00]  That is victory.  Yeah.  I know.  He's very happy.  Are you crying?  Ah, turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Somebody's just writing turd.  Turd.  Oh, of course you just gotta write turd.  Ah, turd.  You just won your speaker of the house, turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Fuck turd.  You don't like turd?  I hate turd.  Turd.  Turd.  I don't think turd was the problem. 
[01:13:30]  I don't know.  In that situation.  Part of it.  Do you want to hear wrestling guy?  No, we got too much to do today.  Yeah.  Hey, so I want to play this from the Jersey Shore reunion, and you tell me what the problem  is.  Reunion?  Yes, Anthony.  Pay attention.  Why a reunion?  Because.  Because the show's over until they go back to Jersey, which they already filmed.  I don't know when that runs.  Probably January, I would assume.  Yeah, 16 of pregnant's better, whatever that is.  I'm a teen pregnancy fucking whore. 
[01:14:00]  That show's good.  They're all fun to watch.  I like that one.  I don't give a shit.  Stupid girl with the braces.  We had to give up our daughter.  I had to give up my daughter because I was too young, but now we're going to go visit  them because the poor adoptive parents have to put up with us now for the rest of the  child's life.  Stan's sister, right?  Was it Stan?  Yeah.  In South Park.  She looks like, what the fuck is that?  Sounds like that. 
[01:14:30]  Jesus.  I think you found the best site ever.  Just put in teen braces?  Wow.  You just put teen braces in Google?  And that comes up?  What the fuck?  Click on the second one in.  Who is that bitch?  That doesn't seem legal.  Oh, that's great right there.  That's legal.  Oh, by the way.  They don't look very legal.  Look up Princess with the braces.  The fucking.  I did.  I couldn't find it.  What's that?  Dude, come on.  What are you doing?  He couldn't find it.  No, her name is Michelle.  M-I-C-H-E-L-L-E. 
[01:15:00]  Something.  Look up Michelle, Princess Brace.  I can't.  I have the porn here.  I'll let you know.  Yeah.  She's so fucking dirty.  Take it from your laptop there.  So, this is what happened on the Jersey Shore reunion and now there's a situation.  The situation spent a lot of time with this girl that she got like all the clues that  lead me to believe she's a man.  She was wearing something to hide that Adam's apple.  She had something on her hands.  So, we think the situation might have got himself into a situation with the tranny out  here.  I don't even know what the fuck I was thinking. 
[01:15:30]  That's the first time.  First time that that has happened.  A tranny is a tranny grenade.  A tranny.  Dang.  Nobody's trained to deal with that type of warfare.  The new phrase in Miami is if you gotta think about it.  If you have to think about it.  If you have to think about it.  You even have to hesitate to think.  It is.  It is.  The tranny.  Stay away.  It's usually a dude.  The fucking music and the sound effect. 
[01:16:00]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  It's so annoying.  What are they?  The only station that really rocks?  Yeah.  I object.  You gotta have a bed behind everything.  I object.  I'm glad they apologized for that mistreatment of our tranny friends.  Oh, boy.  I do not like this mistreatment.  You into that?  No.  It was more than the situation.  They were all talking about trannies on Jersey Shore, and I guess you can't even do that  on a reality show, by the way.  Wait, what was so bad about that?  That was my question to you.  I just heard it.  Did you hear any problems in that segment?  No, I heard him talking about trannies and the fact that he might have delved. 
[01:16:30]  I have more of a problem that they're forcing terms down our throat.  Only I could do that, motherhugger.  Oh, God.  MTV is...  Every time I forget that one.  Motherhugger.  You said motherhugger almost, though.  Yeah.  On that one, you're like, Anthony!  Motherhugger.  Yeah, motherhugger.  Mudder.  Yeah, it was kind of mudder.  But it is mother.  Yeah.  M-U-T-H-A-H-U-C-K-A.  The worst one of those was when you went, I'm stylin'. 
[01:17:00]  Turd?  All right.  Turd?  Turd?  Turd?  MTV apologizes for Jersey Shore's segment.  Why?  This is fucking...  It's exhausting.  I can't even figure out why.  Every day there's one of these.  Why do you doodle?  Because they were talking about trannies and saying that, you know...  Yeah, but you've got to stay away from trannies.  I'll tell you why.  GLAAD is more powerful in that business than the Italian-American groups that they were offending. 
[01:17:30]  That's why they stuck to themselves on fucking...  But we can't even make fun of trannies.  But do you understand?  That's why they apologized for that, because GLAAD is more powerful.  We can't even make fun of trannies, really?  But was it making fun?  What did he say?  Stay away.  Adam's apple.  Oh, yeah.  Just the whole thing.  But if you're a heterosexual guy...  Right.  You don't want to fucking be fooled.  Yeah, yeah.  If you're a heterosexual guy, that's hilarious to your friends if all of a sudden you're hitting  on a girl and it turns out to be a tranny. 
[01:18:00]  That's fucking funny.  So what's the apology?  Well, MTV has issued an apology to GLAAD for a segment during last week's Jersey Shore  reunion special.  GLAAD decreed as offensive a segment where Mike the Situation flirts with an unidentified nightclub  patron who his friend said was a tranny.  GLAAD described it as one of the most blatantly transphobic scenes aired anywhere on television  in the last few years.  Transphobic?  There's now something called transphobic?  For using the word tranny?  You can't even use the word tranny? 
[01:18:30]  I hope you can.  I mean...  And fucking MTV.  What the fuck's wrong with you guys?  GLAAD says MTV has agreed to remove the segment after the current rotation cycle.  Oh, they're the worst.  Will you stop fucking doing that?  Stop listening to GLAAD.  Just stop listening to all the special interest groups.  But they're particularly hypersensitive.  Oh, really?  They're particularly hypersensitive and irritating.  I didn't even know there was something called transphobic. 
[01:19:00]  They go after Red Eye a lot for Gutfeld and he invites them on to debate and every time  they refuse to go on with him on Red Eye.  Uh, MTV, we appreciate GLAAD voicing concern about the Jersey Shore reunion special.  The segment in question was certainly not meant to be insensitive.  But in retrospect, we realize that it was offensive to some viewers.  We sincerely apologize.  That's...  It's those fucking dumb motherfuckers who run the play.  It's not the Jersey Shore people. 
[01:19:30]  It's just ridiculous.  Sorry we did that.  Sorry.  You heard the clip.  What was wrong with that?  That's how guys think.  Your friend is making out with a tranny.  You're going to fucking make jokes.  You're going to make fun of them, of course.  God, enough already.  The term tranny.  Do you know GLAAD, I guess, got mad at Glee?  Yeah, of course they did.  For using the word tranny on that stupid show.  Because they were doing a Rocky Horror episode.  And one of the characters was backing out of the Frankenfurter part.  Because his parents didn't want him dressing like a tranny. 
[01:20:00]  And that's in quotes.  Uh, and then GLAAD got all mad because they were using the T word.  We're fucked.  We're fucked.  It's the T word.  Entertainment is going to fucking suck in another few years.  The only way to handle it is to fucking not at all be apologetic.  Unless you're really sorry and be belittal.  Right.  There was nothing even bad in that.  Just say fuck off.  Shut up.  Fruit.  But the way to handle it is to just be honest about it and go, stop being hypersensitive. 
[01:20:30]  Stop being such fucking babies.  I'm not sorry I said it.  I was being funny.  Again, stop it.  Ugh.  Well, that's how most performers would probably handle it.  It's the people.  You know who it is, dude.  It's not the performers.  But Ron Howard, you know, had a great statement the other day.  Tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny.  Stop it.  Tranny, tranny.  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  We live in a world you can't even make fun of the trannies?  But it wasn't even, it's like if straight guys fucking, one of them is hitting on a 
[01:21:00]  tranny.  You're right.  Your friends are going to goof on you.  That's just normal.  Of course they are.  Trannies are funny.  They're funny.  They're terrific.  They're men dressed like women.  No.  Stop it.  Stop with your lies.  Stop spreading your Christian propaganda.  They're good eggs is what they are.  They're special gals.  They're special gals.  What makes you feel like it's a woman?  What?  The big over-the-top breasts.  What do you mean, what makes you?  Did you ever see those out?  Look at that vision.  The giant hands.  We can't make fun of that.  That looks like E-Rock in a divine wig.  It really is. 
[01:21:30]  We can't make fun of that.  Really?  Really?  Can't make fun of a man?  Stupid MTV.  A guy that looks like a fucking man?  Really?  We can't make fun of that?  Oh, come on.  Jimmy, what do you think of that one?  Oh.  That's a little much.  Oh, we should.  We should.  Is he done with the liners?  We should get him in just to.  No, I know we should, but he's doing liners.  Is he done?  Oh, then get him right in, man.  We got Jason.  Jason Schwartzman from Bored to Death.  Hi, JC.  There he is.  How you doing, man?  Welcome to the show. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, look at these two hugging.  Yeah, they're familiar.  Hi, what's going on?  That's Danny.  Anthony, how you doing?  Here's the opster.  Real pleasure.  The opster.  Wow, hugging Jimmy and everything.  Yes.  Yeah, well.  Just two men of similar ilk.  Just two Hollywood guys, just kind of.  Yeah.  A couple actors of similar ilk.  Yeah, sure.  Pull up close to you, baby.  How are you?  I know we're going to talk about Bored to Death, but look what I got in my hand.  Oh, wow.  And I have not seen the movie yet, and I can't wait. 
[01:22:30]  Scott Pilgrim vs. the World on Blu-ray.  When does this come out?  Did it just come out this week?  Yep.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yesterday came out?  Yeah.  I can't wait to watch this movie.  Oh, good.  I missed it when it was in theaters, because I became a father, so I haven't really seen  a lot of-  When did you become a father?  Six months ago.  Just about.  Yeah.  What was the birthday?  Actually, Mother's Day, May 9th.  Wow.  Yeah.  You have kids?  I'm about to.  Oh, really?  In four weeks.  Oh, whoa.  You want to talk?  I can tell you something.  Yeah, I would love to talk.  You're right there.  I know.  Do you have children?  No!  No! 
[01:23:00]  He takes them.  No, he's the father, and I'm the pervert, and he's the-  I'm the drunk gambler.  Feel all bases covered.  What about you?  Who is he?  Danny.  He's the producer.  Don't worry about him.  But you don't-  So you're the pervert, he's the-  He's the drunk gambler, and Opus kind of like-  He's kind of like the psychotic one, but he's gotten responsible because he's happily  married with a kid.  You could add something to the father thing.  No problem.  I can handle it.  Yeah, but it's true, though.  You're not just a dad.  I know he's a dad for, what, a few months?  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  Six months.  How do you feel?  They don't want to hear this.  I'm curious.  It completely changed my life.  Oh, great.  I always say that anybody I know that has kids, it's like in Invasion of the Body Snatchers  when they fall asleep next to the beanpot.  Because they don't want to change.  They're like, ah, anything.  I'm not going to go to sleep.  I'm not going to do it.  I'm not.  And then the second they do it and get up, it's like, dude, it's not that bad.  Join us.  Hey, have a kid.  And then everything's fine.  And then you realize, oh my God, they're carting around like a bunch of stuff for the kid.  And I call my brother because my brother had a kid like two years ago now. 
[01:24:00]  But when he first had it, it was, you coming over?  What are you doing?  Ah, I'm busy.  Ah, I got that.  And then they come over and they got to bring a bunch of shit.  And then my brother used to stay for like hours.  We'd just hang out and drink.  And I was like, oh, look at his watcher.  Oh, I got to get the baby back.  And you're just, you know, it's over.  It's just over.  Do you get angry that he has to leave and stuff?  Does it bum you out?  Yeah, a little bit.  It is a little bit of a bummer because it's like, yeah, I just want to kind of hang out. 
[01:24:30]  Because there's not enough time for Anthony.  You hang out and, you know, like we used to hang out and just drink.  Drink.  But the other side of that, you just don't mind any of that crap.  You just don't.  Yeah.  I don't mind packing my car like I'm going away for a month just for one night in Philly.  Yeah, right.  What is she having?  We don't know.  Oh, you want a surprise.  We're going to wait, yeah.  Did you wait or did you know?  I wanted to know because nine months of being pregnant is a long haul.  So it gave us a nice little thing to talk about. 
[01:25:00]  You know what I mean?  It was a distraction.  Yeah.  Yeah, I wanted to know.  If we have a second one, then I would go in not knowing I think.  Yeah.  Are you scared?  Huh?  Are you scared?  I just feel like what is the, like, I feel like I'm going to mess up and therefore no  one, I mean, if everyone messes up in some way, so there's no, like, you can't, what  do you, what is the, what's a perfect record? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, no one has that.  So then I kind of just feel like what am I, what's my standard?  As long as you're not raising a Jeffrey Dahmer or something like that, you know, I bet those  parents are a little bummed that they, they probably messed up somewhere.  Yeah.  Someone who commits an armed robbery, their parents are like, where'd they go wrong?  When your son eats other people, you're probably like, could we have stopped this?  Do we suck that much as parents?  Yes, you do.  How did this happen?  I got a man's foot in a bowl.  That is pretty bad.  That's so true. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, man.  I wonder about, yeah, do you just, like, lie in bed with your wife at night looking at the  ceiling, having, like, that little talk before bed, and it's just like, what happened?  Yeah, what did we do?  It's not our fault, too.  We talk about the...  Yeah, we trace it.  What can we trace it back to?  What did we do?  We talk about the parents that give birth to their own killer.  What about the...  Yeah, that's the honest thing.  Where you were just going through your life, you decide to have a kid, and then he grows  up and ends up killing you.  And kills you.  It's like you gave birth to a tumor that was going to kill you, like, years later.  Full circle, I guess. 
[01:26:30]  But congratulations.  It's a lovely conversation.  No, glass is half full.  I'm going to always go glass half.  You know, it's a full circle.  It is the circle of life, Simba.  Why don't we shut up?  You're right.  I know where I was at four weeks out.  It's beautiful.  So four weeks away.  Are you going to take time?  Are you done shooting?  Why do you guys have the Gatorade?  You guys have...  Do you guys...  Are you low on the electrolytes?  Anthony drinks Gatorade.  I don't like it.  Yeah, I have that.  And you know what?  They bring it in every day.  I never drink it anymore.  Really?  I just drink water.  So is this the new, the G series? 
[01:27:00]  Like, there's like refuel, re-this, re-that.  Is that a new, like, do they get rid of the old Gatorade and it's only this new thing?  Or is this a special?  They just repackaged it.  Okay, yeah.  You know, they want it to look, like, cool, I guess.  Yeah.  So they just put the G.  Because the old Gatorade bottle looked a little dated.  Yeah, right.  You know?  Yeah, that's old.  It is pretty awesome.  And with all the energy drinks.  It's just the G with the lightning bolt.  Have you had the purple one?  No.  Grape?  What?  Oh, you're talking about Gatorade.  It's disgusting. 
[01:27:30]  It's awesome.  It is?  I love it.  Because grape is the hardest of all the artificial flavors to nail.  Grape, low-calorie Gatorade rules.  Really?  Good stuff?  I hate Gatorade.  It makes my mouth dry and sugary.  You don't like that?  It doesn't refresh me at all.  What do you like it?  After sliming and salty.  Yeah.  Look at that.  I like flu mouth.  They're calling us The View right now.  All right.  I know.  I know.  We really are.  A bunch of hens just chit-chatting.  It's going to be marvelous. 
[01:28:00]  God bless.  So obviously, I mean, Jason comes in and hugs Jimmy because Jimmy was on board to death.  Yeah.  Did the one episode.  It was tremendous.  Yeah, it was funny, man.  Really fun to do, man.  It really was.  Jimmy says you're such a nice guy.  And you treat everyone with respect on the set.  Yeah, it was good to watch.  And I think that should be said because we interview a lot of assholes.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And they say the same thing about us when they leave.  How do you know they're assholes?  Yeah.  You just sense by the way they handle certain questions.  They're not fun.  And it's like, you know, after being on the set for a week or whatever it was, on five  or six different days, you can get a vibe of how people are. 
[01:28:30]  You're the best.  Thank you.  I loved every time I would see Jim, I just felt like the day got better.  I don't want to make it a cheese fest.  Yeah.  I'm happy.  No one's ever said that before.  Thank you.  You're the first in 42 years.  But he's so, he's just the best.  You know, he's the best.  And he would always, we'd be working so late and he'd get up to come here sometimes.  I was just committed, man.  His work ethic is ridiculous.  It really is.  But it's obsessive.  And I read your book.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  He gave me the book.  I love, I just, he's a good, this is a, he's the best.  Thank you.  And so, I was so happy when I heard you were going to be in here too.  It made me, because like, you know, I love to see you.  Thank you, man.  So, he's the best.  It was interesting to watch like how people act and it's like, I had no idea who your family  was.  There's nothing in the way Jason acts that you would know that, look, you come from royalty  in Hollywood.  And there's not, but honestly, but there's not one ounce of the way this guy acts that you would  know that if someone didn't say like, you know. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, yeah, really?  Yeah, that's nice.  Okay, okay, we'll move on now.  See?  I look at him now.  I don't care.  Anyways.  It was, I saw that episode was great with Jimmy.  That was a fun one.  It really was funny.  You let your butt hang out on that one.  Yes.  I know, but I had to sign a nudity release.  I had to sign a nudity release.  HBO sent me, because my ass hang out.  There was one more where he was really spanking it well, but I guess they figured that was too,  it just took us out of the scene a little too much.  A little bit.  And I had to sign a nudity waiver that let them know I'm comfortable with being naked. 
[01:30:00]  And I was completely happy.  Of course you are.  We had to rehearse so many times and be falling on him.  It was really weird.  Like, there's a guy, a stuntman, who actually takes you down and goes through every move  with you.  So we knew exactly how we were going to fall.  They didn't care if I got hurt, but they were so worried that Jason was going to get  hurt.  Yeah.  He was going to get hurt.  And they're like, all right, lump, just be careful of Jason.  That's true.  But yeah, they take you through everything, you know you're not going to get hurt, and  they have you falling on a mat.  And we laid on each other for a while.  It was odd. 
[01:30:30]  Close.  That is a bit odd.  I know.  I love the stunt guys.  They're an amazing group in the world of movies and television and stuff.  Their section is so amazing.  There's not a lot of stuntmen, and they're like a brotherhood.  But it's an amazing...  Are they just like real men?  Are they real men?  And they always look out for each other, and there's different...  You know, some people are like expert car flippers. 
[01:31:00]  Some people are expert fighters.  But the funny thing is, every time I've ever met someone who's going to do a stunt for  me, they say, this is your...  This is, you know, this gentleman, he's going to do your stunt.  And they bring over a guy who's like, me, if I didn't mess up with the eating, and like  the late night partying, like the guys come in, they just jack gymnast versions of me.  And it's so weird, because they do look similar.  They're my height, but they're just like beautiful.  They have beautiful bodies. 
[01:31:30]  And I just feel like...  I hope you don't say that to them.  I do.  It's the first thing I say.  It's the first thing I say.  I just say, I'm Jason.  You have a beautiful body.  Really, all kidding aside, just terrific.  They've come a long way with the stunt doubles, though.  Remember when we were growing up, man?  Oh, God.  You know, if they had to do a stunt for a woman or something.  Oh, right.  It was a guy in a wig.  It was so horribly done.  And the guy's like big and bulky.  Did you see I'm Gonna Get You Sucka, that movie?  I'm Gonna Get You Sucka.  Oh, yeah.  Years and years ago.  I love that.  There's a scene where this girl has to do a bunch of backflips, and they just literally 
[01:32:00]  put in a guy with a mustache.  It's so funny.  Doing the flips for her.  It was gonna kill me.  You know who some of the best stunt things, who they did was William Shatner in the original  Star Trek.  So bad.  It was like, sometimes it would just be this big, fat guy, and he's swinging, and then  you'd just see Kirk is on the ground, and the best was when Kirk had to fight Kirk.  Oh.  It was those episodes.  And they wouldn't even care.  Like, it's engineering, and they would go with a long shot. 
[01:32:30]  But you look and go, who's he fighting?  Right.  This is a totally different looking guy.  The guy's got darker hair.  I gotta see that now.  I guess so.  Yeah, it's really bad.  Yeah.  Really bad.  But they didn't care.  Dan it, dan it, dan it, dan it, dan it.  Did you see, we were just talking before you came in about Tom Cruise does his own stunts.  I had no idea he did his own stuff.  Yeah.  And there's footage of him on the side of the tower.  Yeah.  In Dubai.  I saw a picture of it.  Why would you do that when you don't have to?  It's his thing.  He's into that whole, you know, yeah.  Yeah, that's his hobby.  Do you think you get bored, though, when you're a guy like that, and you have everything, 
[01:33:00]  you're like the biggest star in Hollywood, and women love you, so there's basically no  more conquest.  You just kind of have to keep challenging yourself.  I don't understand why.  But I think he always did his stunts.  They're just getting more out of control.  Really?  In risky business?  I think he did his stunts in risky business.  Apparently he did, like, remember.  Did he slide in his socks?  Yeah, he was the guy that slid.  Because he could have fallen down.  Yeah, that was him.  He could have hurt him.  Yeah, that was a very difficult stunt.  Who was the, what was the movie where, was it Mission Impossible 2, where the preview  was him on the rock?  That was apparently really him.  Yeah, that's craziness. 
[01:33:30]  How high up is that?  Oh my God, that was really crazy.  I don't know.  A couple feet.  Oh, yeah, I thought it was higher.  I was a little bit nervous.  No, no, no.  The pad was right there.  Jason, did you ever see this?  That's one of my favorite.  Oh my God!  That was a girl.  Is that real?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This, it's two chicks.  Oh, no.  This video went viral.  They're, she's fine.  Yeah, she's doing a, uh...  They're trying to re-back risky business and she cracks her head.  Why, why, why are we laughing? 
[01:34:00]  But I also love this weird house.  It's got, like, a nude jukebox.  Like, that's like an MP3 jukebox, I have a feeling.  Yeah, yeah.  And then...  It's big TV.  Where are they?  Flat screen.  Really polished wood floors.  One plant just didn't make it.  And then they're in their undies for some reason.  Yeah, that could, that could have been really hot and it was hilarious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, Ant would know.  Ow!  Adam West, stuntman, and, uh, Batman was a fat guy in tights.  Do you remember that one?  Uh, wasn't a big fan of the Batman.  No, wasn't a fan of the Batman show on TV.  Yeah, wasn't a big fan of the original Batman series. 
[01:34:30]  But Jackie Chan does them all.  Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.  Yeah, he's legendary for it.  But he's a martial artist.  You'd kind of expect Jackie to be...  Yeah.  Tom Cruise is, I mean, I was wondering how much the insurance is to get a guy like that to hang  1,500 feet in the air off the side of a building.  I don't know.  Gotta be 10 bucks a month.  Oh, all right.  See, I would have thought it was higher.  Okay.  I don't know.  Jason, you didn't have any...  Can I have a slice of that gum really quickly?  Oh, yeah.  You didn't have any acting experience when you did Rushmore?  At 17, by the way?  No.  Well, I didn't.  In fact, I had two of my friends going into, like, 9th or 10th grade of mine. 
[01:35:00]  I was in 9th or 10th grade as well.  They auditioned for a play, and I went with them, but I didn't make it.  But then I got a call back because our school was just so not, like, normal.  Like, we didn't have a real theater department, all that stuff, and so they needed anyone they  could get, so they asked me to be a member of the background.  And, you know, be a member of a crowd. 
[01:35:30]  That was my only acting experience to that point.  Unbelievable.  Were you all scared walking out as a crowd?  Were you all nervous?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  I was like, uh...  Do you remember your first line?  I didn't have a line.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I didn't even have a line.  Yeah, and it was a really...  It was a down experience because...  I don't know if you guys were ever in theater in school or anything.  A little bit.  Were you?  A little bit.  It's...  Was it clicky?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's why I hated it.  Yeah, that's...  I couldn't...  Like, I got...  You know, it was just very... 
[01:36:00]  It was like a...  It was so weird because I love how even within...  Like, you know, there's...  Popularity keeps getting subdivided and subdivided.  And so, like, there's all these really cool jocks and then, to them, the theater people are nerds.  But then you get into the theater group and then within the theater group, there's like...  Their own pecking order.  Yeah, they're like, you're the nerds.  And so, like, I remember getting in there and I was like, God, this feels just as bad as it did on the outside.  You know, it's just like...  There's like jocks of the acting world, too. 
[01:36:30]  Wow.  And, yeah, and so I just...  I didn't take to it, really.  And so Rushmore was my first true acting experience.  That's hard to believe because you were great in that.  Well, I honestly...  It was...  If you think so, I appreciate that.  And if there's any reason, it's just because Wes Anderson was such an amazing guide and really helped me through.  And also, Mr. Bill Murray was a lot of...  Yeah, you got to act with Bill Murray as your first acting gig.  Yeah, the two of them were really, like, helped me through. 
[01:37:00]  Did they yell at you?  They could tell I was nervous.  Did they yell at you at all?  No yelling.  What are you doing?  No yelling.  God, that's not acting.  No.  You know how scary it is, though, to act?  Because they can all act.  Jason's great.  Zach is great.  And if Dan's...  He's dancing.  Yeah, of course.  And your whole thing at a table reader, everything is, please just don't let me fuck this up.  That's all you're thinking is, don't let me suck.  So what happened?  Yeah.  I don't know.  You didn't suck.  It was almost like I was so sure I was going to blow it that I...  It's like you're not nervous and you don't blow it. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  You were great.  Thank you.  But I was nervous that I was going to blow it.  Yeah, you were really good.  Well, I'll tell you, I mean, I'm nervous the...  Like, we do these table reads, you know, for the show, and they're very...  They get the whole cast and a bunch of the different department heads get together, and it's really nice  because you actually can hear the whole script right out loud and see what's working and not  right.  But it's an intimidating experience.  That sounds unbelievably intimidating.  Well, there's a camera, too.  Like having to sit on a table and read your fucking part. 
[01:38:00]  I'm a terrible reader.  Like, when it's fortune cookie time and everyone's going around the table, I'm, like, trying to  memorize it so that when it gets to me...  Oh, that you don't have to actually read it?  I'm a terrible...  There's a real, like, breakdown between my brain, my eyes, and my mouth.  I'm a terrible out loud reader.  Terrible out loud reader.  I'm with you on that.  I don't know.  I wish I was...  I don't know what happens.  And then to be able to read and deliver the line the way, you know, you think you're supposed  to be delivering it...  Right.  Because you're not just...  You guys aren't just sitting there reading like you're reading the paper, right? 
[01:38:30]  You gotta have to emote.  Yeah.  I would gather.  Yeah, the lines just come out because I'm trying to remember them.  And so any pause I take that seems dramatic is me just going, line?  What's the next word?  Yeah, well, I...  Gotta read this.  You have literally the heads of HBO there, and there's a camera which you know they're  watching you in Los Angeles, too.  Yeah.  They're watching, so you know that there's people that you can't even see watching.  It really is horrifying.  Wow.  Yeah.  And you're like, I know.  I'm going to wind up blowing this.  And then they had a second table read, and I'm like, I told my manager, they want to  fire me, don't they? 
[01:39:00]  They're doing this because they want to fire me.  And he's like, no, you idiot.  They're just doing the read.  I'm like, but that's why they're doing it, because they're not sure if they want me.  Yeah.  You know, paranoid and shit.  Yeah.  That's funny.  I guess you always...  I mean, you know, what is job security, anyway?  I guess we're all afraid we're going to, you know, get fired.  Like, I always think that during the entire shooting process, I'm just like...  You really think they're just going to, like, get sick of you and replace you, or are you  going to screw up?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I do.  I do, but it's, but, I don't know, maybe that's just part of who I, part of, I don't 
[01:39:30]  know, I just think about that kind of stuff, because you want to do a good job, and, you  know, and I guess to me, it's just because I'm excited to be there.  Genuinely, like, I love, I love TV and movies, like, that was, and music, that's all, like,  my childhood is all that stuff, and watching stuff and loving stuff, and for me, like, to  be a part of it, it's, like, it's cool.  It's a real dream come true, so it's, uh, I don't want to mess it up.  Yeah, that would suck.  I know.  How bad was... 
[01:40:00]  Plus, I can't do any...  I don't know how to do it.  I don't know how to do it.  I can't do anything else.  Anything else.  No, I need, I need this.  Was I heart Huckabees as bad on the set as the videos we've seen all over YouTube with  Lily and the director yelling at each other, or was that an isolated couple of moments,  or was the whole time...  Because that's, like, a legendary breakdown.  Or was it put on, too?  Some people think it was just a put on.  Yeah, I've wanted it to put on, too, but I don't think so.  No, it was, um, I'll tell you, I love David O. Russell so much.  He's the writer and director of that movie.  If he called me right now, if, like, line three lit up right now in this studio, David, 
[01:40:30]  if you're listening, and he said, let's, I would like to work together again, I wouldn't...  In a second, right?  I would, he's one of the, I feel like there are so many filmmakers out there who, um, you  know, just are making things because it's part of, they're just part of a, um, a process  or a larger corporate, uh, business making movies, which is fine, because I love all types  of movies, Hollywood, big, everything.  Like, but he's, I could genuinely say, I think is one of the very few, like, real, um, directors 
[01:41:00]  in the old style sense of, like, has something he wants to, um, get across and has a way he  sees a movie and writes a movie, and so he, he's a, he's one of the few amazing, uh, artist  directors out there, and I loved being on that set.  It was awesome.  It was so unlike any other thing I've ever been on, and, um, I feel bad that that moment  got out there, because, um, you know, when you're working in any, when those hours are 
[01:41:30]  crazy, as you know, and, um, you know, tensions are running high when you really are, when you  love something, you're trying to make something, and that was just a stupid moment that was  one minute, and then everyone went back to, to working, and, uh, but, you know, it just,  you don't see all that stuff, but, um, you know, like, ten minutes later, Lily, Lily and  everyone was just laughing, and it was back to business, so, um, yeah, it was, but it  was, it was, um, it was an amazing experience to be part of that movie.  I would do it all over again if I could work with him again. 
[01:42:00]  Well, because it was almost like when the, uh, who had the breakdown on, uh, uh, Christian  Bale?  Oh, yeah.  So when they catch those things now, um, we don't know.  Yeah, there's no real build-up, and there's no finish.  Like, everybody has some crap at, uh, at work that happens.  Right.  You might have a blowout or something like that, and then it's done, and, and it's over with,  but you don't put that part on YouTube, because that's the boring part, you know?  Well, now, I mean, the interesting thing is everything is cataloged and, um, yeah, yeah. 
[01:42:30]  And around.  It's all.  Very interesting.  Forever.  Yeah, that will be around.  Were you on the set when that actually happened, or did you actually see it, like, later, like  everybody else?  Were you in the room when they had the argument?  Yeah, I'm between the two.  I'm the person sitting in the chair between the two of them.  Oh, I didn't even remember that.  Are you really?  Oh, my God.  How uncomfortable.  Everyone leaves, and it's just him, me, and her.  How uncomfortable.  I should have watched that before you came in.  I didn't know, Jason, when that, I've seen that.  Oh.  What were you doing?  Just kind of, oh, shit.  Get in the scrubs.  At that point, it's really uncomfortable when two people in any situation are arguing. 
[01:43:00]  Are you, like, just avoiding eye contact with everybody so it doesn't appear that you're  taking sides?  Well, the thing is, I can't really think about that experience particularly, but I will tell  you that, you know when you watch a movie and something bad is happening and the main  character slowly creeps towards the sound at the end of the hall, you're like, don't  do that, don't do that.  Right.  Like, I wouldn't go to the sound at the end of the hall, but drama.  I am fascinated by drama, and I become like, it's like a kid staring at a fire. 
[01:43:30]  Like, I become transfixed and tranced out.  It's like Burning Man festival.  But, like, I'll tell you one time, I was at a market, and I was leaving a market with  my two brothers, and they're, you know how markets nowadays have, sometimes have a security  guard, which is so weird.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Have you seen that?  Like, it's one of these, I don't remember that ever in my childhood.  Do you?  No.  Not growing up, but I've seen it many times.  You go to LA, you go to these, like, open air markets or wherever. 
[01:44:00]  Why would they have security guards?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Visual deterrent for violence or whatever?  It's so, it's so weird, but there's stuff only costs like 10, 15 cents.  It's weird.  You're, you're, don't shoot the messenger.  It's just part of the story.  So I go, I go, so I'm leaving this market with my brothers, and there is a gentleman who  looks deranged.  I mean, you can't judge a book by its cover, but I could judge this book by its cover.  Yes, but you can judge a book by its cover when the cover's been eaten off. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, he didn't, he didn't, he didn't look, he didn't look all together there.  You were in Santa Monica, weren't you?  I was.  Okay.  And the security guard who was not limber or, you know, he was an older, he should not  have been a security guard.  And so basically this deranged man is trying to get into the market, and the security guard  is blocking him, like a football player, like, trying to block him.  And people are just walking in and out of the supermarket like it's not happening.  And my brother's like, let's go to the car, let's go to the car. 
[01:45:00]  But I'm like, this is incredible.  I don't want to see how this plays out.  The deranged guy begins, there's like a big bucket of like, for sale watermelons.  He starts picking up watermelons and hurling them at the security guard.  But he's deranged and the security guard's old, so it's like all happening in a very messed  up way.  But watermelons are breaking everywhere.  It was so weird.  And then this student, like, I only assume it was a student because it was near a college.  It's like, this guy's walking down the street, who to me clearly looked like a guy who's been 
[01:45:30]  taking karate classes for years and has just been waiting.  For this moment.  Right.  And so he just walks down this, this guy just walks down, my brothers went to the car and  I just stopped and was just watching it like three feet away.  I couldn't stop.  This guy walks down the street, sees it, walks up to the deranged man, puts him in a choke  hold, like he exerts no energy, puts the guy to sleep with like a sleeper hold.  And the guy falls down into the mush of watermelons and then he just walks into the market, doesn't 
[01:46:00]  say a word.  And I just stood there transfixed.  And that is my obsession with drama.  And that is how I was feeling during the David O. Russell thing.  I love it.  I love any type of yelling or weird confrontations or stuff.  And when I met, like, you know, when you're at a, like, I've never been the type of person  who's, if something's wrong, I'll tell the person at a restaurant, like, this isn't right, 
[01:46:30]  I'll just eat it.  Like, I'm like Randy Quaid in The Last Detail.  I just like, I'll eat it how I should just, whatever.  But when people are in front of me in a line that says, excuse me, this isn't right.  Though I think they're being kind of jerky, I love that they're doing it.  You can't, you like to watch the violence or whatever it is unfolding.  Or just the drama in general.  Yeah, I guess.  Sometimes it's not violence.  It's just fascinating to me.  I'm a huge fan of that as well.  I just don't like being part of it.  I can watch people all day long.  I don't like being in a scene.  Yeah.  Like, like. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've been, I've been in relationships where I've had to turn and go, like, don't do it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, because I don't like being in it.  But if somebody's yelling at somebody else, I'm not moving.  It is fascinating.  Yeah, it is.  I don't know what that is.  Well, if you're happening next to it at a table in a restaurant, you can kind of hear it.  Yeah, yeah.  Great.  You've got to listen.  I love it  oh she's pissed  I find myself a lot of times  where violence has been happening  where I've actually walked  and my girlfriend says  what are you doing  but I've walked towards it  not to get involved 
[01:47:30]  but I feel like  it can affect me  sometimes you feel like  and then there's  when you step back  you're like  I could be peripheral  what's it called  a collateral damage hero  but you don't think  of that sometimes  I just want to see  if there's going to be  a shooting  or  get out of there  I know  and it's so dumb  that's how idiots  wind up in the hospital  it's called  innocent bystander  or even like  yeah  living in New York  for bored to death  walking my dog  late at night  you know  I get home from work  and then I walk my dog  and sometimes 
[01:48:00]  like 2 or 3 in the morning  seeing like  drunk guys  fighting outside  I'll stop  and just watch it  with my dog  like right there  my wife's like  let's go  let's go  let's go  and I just can't  stop watching it  I love it  but you're not  a get involved guy either  like you're not  going to jump in  I wish  if you saw a guy  hitting a girl  yeah  I'd like to think  that I would stop that  but it's like  sometimes I don't know  if I would  but this is what  bored to death  that feeling right there  is actually  I'm not to bring it  back to the show  but that's the whole  thing that I try to 
[01:48:30]  want to get across  with the characters  because I think that  like that's why  he becomes a detective  because he doesn't know  how he would handle  himself in certain situations  so he like becomes  this detective  and like  maybe he couldn't  do it as himself  like be tough  but if he's like  pretending to be  a private eye  his like mind  will follow his body  sort of  and so  because I always  feel like  am I this enough  am I strong  would I protect someone  how would I do  in a fight  you know  would I do  what's right  and that's probably 
[01:49:00]  what my character  is asking himself  that's kind of  why he becomes  a detective  and it's fun  for me to be able  to like go  hey that's not right  in the scenes  you know  like get in the middle  of a fight  because it feels good  to like do it  because you would  never do it  in real life  I look around  to the crew  is that believable  I never would  am I supposed to go  I'm wondering  I don't know  it's up to you  date your schedule  we heard you only  have 15 minutes  so we don't want  to mess up your schedule  because you gave me 
[01:49:30]  you slipped me a note  that I almost  want to frame  that said  where is it  this note  that he slipped me  says do you need  to go to Regis  or can you stay  that's not a note  I get very often  believe me  it's not a note  we've had to write  very often  with our guest list  that's very amazing  but I don't know  does anyone out there  we heard we had you  until 8 o'clock  anyone know  see Regis  there's Roland  let's ask Roland  what's he say baby  Roland  Roland  does he have to go  I don't know  is he going to Regis 
[01:50:00]  I just had to listen  go to Regis  Regis and Kelly  what is that  let me get my phone  here really quickly  it's on the phone  do you mind  if I just get on  go right ahead  go right ahead  I don't know  I just don't want  to mess it up  that would be bad  that would suck  if you missed Regis  it's hard to explain  to Regis  that you were  on Opie and Anthony  for too long  I'm just talking  about fighting  and watermelon  throwing  I carried away  Regis  I'm really nervous  to go on the show  because these shows  are like Regis  that's scary  that's a lot of people  watch that thing  yeah  more people will see  that probably  than any of my movie 
[01:50:30]  more people watch  Regis this morning  than any of my movies  combined  probably  no no  Regis is a big audience  but no  not that many  that's a lot of people  did you hear  what he just said  there  oh whoops  we don't have  a lot of people  listening  he's comfortable  here  but being watched  is weird though  man  because if you  make a weird  movie during an interview  and you're being watched  it's really frightening  I would hate to sit there  you're great on Leno though  oh thank you  I'm pretty comfortable  you're good on that one  Jason just notice  how Regis doesn't  know anything  you don't have fun  with that  really  oh yeah  I'm sure he knows 
[01:51:00]  but he pulls it off  every time  he's been doing it  he's a cool dude  anyone who's been  doing it that long  you'll get back to us  and let's go  wow you were right  don't you love  when he and Letterman  are on together  yeah  Letterman's actually  really good on the show  and he's pretty  brutally honest  he is  I never liked the socks  Letterman has on  I have a great objection  to his white socks  they're cabaret socks  they really bother me  they're argyle  but no they're pure white  but he's very funny  and open on the show  I gotta be there  at 845  oh yeah  you better start  and that's  it's Upper West

[01:53:00]  I made this movie  called Scott Pilgrim  versus the world  with Michael Cera  he's the star of it  and he's  do you want to  talk about like  one of the best  people on this planet  if you ever get a  chance to have him in  Michael Cera  we've had him in  he's a great guy  right  yeah we showed him  porno and stuff  oh my god  oh my god  and you showed me  YouTube footage  there's a woman  falling  that is porno  but I love this guy  and I was really  honored to be part  of the movie  and now it's on  Blu-ray  which I don't have  a Blu-ray player 
[01:53:30]  wow really  uh uh  I'm not with it  all about like  Blu-ray  is it great  excellent quality  do you notice  the difference  yeah  sit there and go  wow that's great  you're also talking  to a guy that has  a movie theater  in his house  you do  I had to  so he's kind of  into all this stuff  it's like crazy  it's an 11 foot screen  bunch of  what  got like 14 or so  seats in there  what  yeah it's like  real life  and it looks like  an old school  art deco movie theater  when you go in  oh my god  I needed it  it was like  I'd never go to the movie  oh that's when it was 
[01:54:00]  being built  turns to your right  oh my gosh  that's the look  a look at the seats  that's part of his  is that  is what you  now is what you built  like because you love  this stuff  are you constantly  update  like does the technology  is it changing so quickly  that you're  yeah it really  it really does  but what I'm at  right now  as far as the  projector goes on the  screen is  top notch  storage  I have something called  Kaleidoscape  oh I know  I just load  yeah just load all  your shit into it  it's fantastic  you load it into  a giant hard drive  yeah and then you  just sit there 
[01:54:30]  with the remote  and go through  this giant list  of movies  and then boom  start the movie  dim the lights  blue popcorn  how much is  the Kaleidoscape  expensive  yeah it was  pretty expensive  like what's expensive  I don't know  how much was  the Kaleidoscape  Danny  he's like I don't know  it was  it was five figures  what  just something like that  it's in the thousands  of you know  dollars  it's in the multiple  thousands  the Kaleidoscape  was probably like  ten grand  or something like that  but the projector  was a lot 
[01:55:00]  that was a biggie  I don't know  it was like  thirty  grand  wow really  thirty dollars  thirty dollars  thirty dollars  yeah  it's like a Sony  it's a Bravia  projector  yeah  holy shnikes  yeah it's crazy  but you know what  it's worth a treat  I want to see a movie  that looks like  it's in the movie theater  hey I'll tell you  I think that  like whatever  if you know  what makes you happy  that's what it is  that's not  I mean at the end of the day 
[01:55:30]  maybe a lot of people  would spend much more money  doing something crazy  in the long run  if you put it all right there  and you have it  and it makes you happy  that's why I don't have kids  yeah  I got a full bar  in my house  you don't have kids  yeah what are we talking  for fucking  I get a Guinness  yeah  and then a Bud Light tap  and then just  fucking  did you name your theater  no I didn't name it  yeah  I guess I should name it  I should give it like something  you should get a thing  where you can print out tickets  and stuff  and have people rip it  oh believe me  I've been thinking  about the whole thing  it's a work in progress 
[01:56:00]  the outside  because I want to get  like movie posters  and put them up  in light boxes  like now showing  type stuff  yeah yeah  stuff like that  little monitors  so when you go down  the stairs to the theater  it's showing like movie trailers  and shit  that's cool  and you can just walk in there  alone with a beer  I've done that  plenty of nights  I've reclined those seats  they recline back  and then just drink a beer  and wake up  when the movie goes over  because you fall right asleep  and when the movie is over  the lights automatically come on 
[01:56:30]  so it wakes me up  and I'm like  oh great  I've got to go to work  wow  it's 4 o'clock  we've got to get them out  also hold on  Bored to Death 2  is Bored to Death still on  or is the season done  no no no  it's still on  and we're in the middle  of season 2  we just got picked up  for our third season  which is really exciting news  especially  I think Jimmy could come back  I would hope so  that was left open ended  right  oh yeah  very open ended  maybe Jimmy comes back  maybe he's a young man  who has a case  yeah  you never know  but I'll tell you

So 2010 New York  Comedy Festival,  I'm doing jokes.com  at the Caroline's Comedy Club 
[02:02:00]  tonight at 10 o'clock  and I'm doing a live broadcast  and a live stand-up show  at Caroline's.  Out of shape, huh?  Really, thanks for having me.  No, no, no.  Hang on.  No, because...  What?  We're not...  We'll be all right.  We'll be all right.  We love you.  It's that stupid fucking Stevie.  What could he possibly do?  I came in here aggressive  because I know  what you guys are like.  Yeah.  So I came in here aggressive  so I could hit it  and then leave  and now the awkwardness  is set in.  The listeners love you,  by the way.  Just sit down and relax. 
[02:02:30]  Okay, fine.  Everything's going to be okay.  Didn't he just bolted  last time?  Yes.  I reposted those videos yesterday.  Okay, everything's fine.  It's hilarious.  Everything's good.  My favorite Bobby Lee moment,  our old studio  when the whole console  would go up and down  and we would acknowledge it  and we would do it  in front of you  and you were looking  for someone to...  Anyone else in the room  that has seen  what you were seeing  and we were all in  on the joke  and you were losing  your mind.  Yes.  It's not cool.  You know what I mean though?  I agree.  I've never been here before 
[02:03:00]  and that's not a hello.  You know what I mean?  That's a goodbye.  That's a goodbye?  But you're back.  But I'm back,  so hello again.  Hello.  Hello to you, Bobby Lee.  Hello.  So what's the plug?  You're doing Caroline's  for the Comedy Festival?  I don't know what it is.  Jokes.com live.  Yes, Jokes.com live  for Comedy Central.  It's a live stand-up show  live streaming on the internet  with me and a bunch...  Oh, Joe Mondi.  No, don't worry about it.  No, I'm going to read it.  I've got to read it.  Joe Mondi.  Morgan Murphy is great.  She's great.  Kirk Metzger is great.  Donnell is funny too.  Donnell is really funny.  That's a good show.  And then you're doing Caroline's too?  No.  Oh, what the fuck am I talking about? 
[02:03:30]  All right, I'm sorry.  What are you doing?  What are you in New York for?  Are you just doing this to show?  I'm doing this  and then I go to Kansas City tomorrow.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  Going to do a gig.  How's the road?  Oh, it's awful.  Really?  Really awful.  Every one of you guys  wants off the road, huh?  It's awful.  I don't mind going out  for the weekend,  but I can't go out  for long periods of time.  What don't you like about the road?  First of all,  what I don't like  is Friday Night Second Shows.  Oh, of course.  Really?  Steve Martin said  that's what got him  out of stand-up.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  Steve Martin said.  Oh, really?  I mean, literally,  like, I was in Miami once  and 10 minutes into my set,  there was a couple, 
[02:04:00]  they're black.  I don't know why.  Can I say that?  They're black.  Yeah, I think so.  They were full-blown dancing  in the middle of my set.  Like, as if there was music.  Like, they were doing,  you know what I mean?  Dancing.  I go, what are you guys doing?  We're dancing.  You know what I mean?  They start dancing.  Yeah.  And then some, like,  retarded girl  started giving me, like,  sexual tongue.  While they were dancing,  she was giving me  sexual tongue.  And I literally  started saying F you  to the crowd,  this and that.  There was a riot.  And they had to,  the doorman had to walk me  to my hotel room  because I think  they were losing the crowd.  No, I lost them.  I completely lost them. 
[02:04:30]  But that's like,  that's stand-up.  And it's awful.  And that's the second show,  Friday, is like the bad one?  Late show Friday is notorious.  Because they're all drunk,  and they're all drunk, right?  They're somewhere else  doing dinner and drinking  or whatever.  And they're tired.  They've been working all week.  Yeah, they woke up eight  or whatever.  Wow, I never even thought of that.  It's awful.  That sounds like a fucking  Saturday is great.  Yeah, horrid night.  Late show Saturday is fine.  That late show Friday  and I don't care.  You all right?  He's totally...  I'm okay.  The water went down 
[02:05:00]  the wrong pipe.  Wrong tube.  Wrong tube.  I'm fine.  I love this guy.  I love him.  I love him.  Can I say something?  Yes, Bob.  When is the guy  going to come back?  I don't know.  He's not a man.  Jim.  He's a good boy.  I know.  He's a great boy.  He's literally blind.  You might have to teach him.  Oh, is he really blind?  Almost.  Yeah, he can barely see.  He's not going to do anything to you.  When he looks at the computer,  he's got to get like this close.  You know what?  What the hell?  I will tell you.  Okay, tell me.  I think he has split personalities.  Oh.  And he's going to come in here 
[02:05:30]  as a completely different guy.  I've never seen this character before,  but I hear it's pure lunacy.  Okay, but can I tell you something?  You'll beat the shit out of him?  No, no, no.  What I did earlier,  when I first came in here,  was level seven.  Let's just say that's level seven.  Level seven.  Okay?  There are three levels above it.  Okay?  Level eight.  Do you know some of this?  Yeah, I know all of that.  And at level nine,  it gets real weird.  Really?  It doesn't smell like  a Cambodian jungle in here.  What is that?  It's going to be thick.  You need a machete.  What is a ten?  A ten is... 
[02:06:00]  Is it like a Paul Pai vibe?  Can I go?  Paul Pai.  What?  But you have Danny from Community  coming, right?  At nine?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so, you know.  You can't have two ethnics in here.  It's ridiculous.  We want to do it.  It's crazy.  Sam, is he ready?  Okay, hold on.  You don't have to worry, Bobby.  Sam freaks Bobby out a little bit.  Sam, why don't you explain what's...  Because it's half we don't know what  and half we don't know what.  Sam, what's going on?  Well, Bobby Lee taught Stevie  a life lesson a minute ago.  But can I just say this?  I'm going to throw something out, okay? 
[02:06:30]  If there's anything on me,  I'm leaving.  Okay.  So if there's blood, right?  Anything from within him,  like pus or other stuff,  I'm leaving.  And I'll never come back.  We're not going to put pus on you.  Puss on you.  Nobody wants pus on them.  Stevie's not here anymore,  but one of his friends  wants to get revenge.  Yeah, I'd love to meet him.  Okay.  All right, here we go.  Here he comes.  For the first time on our show.  Oh, my God.  He's wearing a...  I'm Pauly the Penis,  and I'm here to take down Bobby Lee 
[02:07:00]  or give anyone else who wants it sex advice.  You're going down.  You're going down, little man.  I'm here to say,  on behalf of the Wrestling Republic of America,  that you are going down.  Bobby Lee,  the Asian persuasion is going down.  He's wearing a pink...  He's about to do...  Let's go!  Let's go!  Let's go!  Let's go!  Oh, my God.  Relax, relax.  Come on!  Come on!  Let's go!  Can I do the rules?  No! 
[02:07:30]  I need to know the rules.  I need to know the rules.  Well, you came in aggressive with my neck and stuff,  and I'm almost mad,  but like...  You know what I mean?  That was very aggressive.  Like, that wasn't like...  That's like...  Oh, you were aggressive with me?  I can't be aggressive with you.  Yeah, but I wasn't...  I wasn't doing head, like, wrestling moves.  I was just getting sexual.  You know what I mean?  You're being physical.  You know what I mean?  I was getting back...  Yeah, if you want to do gentle touches,  I'll do gentle touches.  Yeah, Stevie, you can grab his neck.  You gotta, you know...  I want to take you down.  My name is Paulie.  I'm gonna...  All right, Paulie.  I'm not here to have sex with you.  But you have an outfit, too, right?  You're wearing an outfit right now, correct? 
[02:08:00]  It's a pink outfit.  A pink outfit?  I have my own outfit.  Can I get into my outfit, please?  That's fair.  All right, that's fair.  Bobby, you want to get into your outfit?  Let me just say,  it's gonna be level eight now.  It's level eight now.  Bobby, leave.  Bobby's getting into his outfit.  All right, Bobby's getting into his outfit,  which means he's completely naked.  He's completely naked.  Get away from me!  Hey, you fuck!  He's completely naked, Bobby.  Hey, Bobby.  Bobby's...  Get him out of here. 
[02:08:30]  Well, it looks like somebody broke character.  Congratulations, Bob.  Bobby, he's completely naked.  No, what the hell are you doing, Sam?  Oh, he's hiding behind Sam.  How did you let that...  What happened to the character, dude?  What happened to the character, dude?  Huh?  What about commitment?  What happened to the character?  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  What happened?  The actor who plays Pauly the Penis  was not comfortable with that.  What happened?  The Asian persuasion, you were calling him.  What happened?  Yeah, yeah.  The Asian persuasion got a little too... 
[02:09:00]  A little too...  He got into his costume.  I got a little too persuasive.  A little too intimate with his...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Costume?  That's a birthday suit.  That's not a costume.  Oh, birthday ship.  Oh, grandma.  What got made me?  You know what I mean?  Is that a hoodie-footie snuggle suit?  Yes, it is.  It's the one I was wearing.  My bulge was much more impressive.  Yeah, you ain't got nothing down there.  You got nothing happening down there, Stevie.  I'm practically getting raped by this guy.  Come on, you want to throw it down?  Let's throw it down.  Let's go.  No, no, no. 
[02:09:30]  Dude, we already played that game.  I won.  No, you raped me.  No, you ran away.  I was not ready.  I won twice, bro.  You ran away.  You ran away.  You were stripping.  I ran.  What?  You ran away.  You ran away twice.  There's wrestling in this.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  No, no, no.  Are you a loser?  You're a loser.  Yeah, you're a loser.  No, I'm not.  Loser.  Loser.  Loser.  Loser.  Loser.  Oh, what's the matter?  What happened after he got into his costume?  You couldn't fucking take it.  It is a costume.  First of all, you see, you know what?  It is a costume.  I don't have yellow skin, dude.  Right?  I'm Mexican.  Costume. 
[02:10:00]  It's a costume.  You pussy it out.  You totally pussy it out.  It's my Pikachu costume.  Loser.  Loser.  Loser.  Loser.  You're a loser.  Loser.  Sam, nowhere did we say that we were going to get naked.  Loser.  Loser.  You got to roll with it.  Hang.  Hang.  Look, he doesn't even want to acknowledge you anymore, Stevie.  Bobby turned his back to you.  He decides to get in his costume when you didn't like it, so let's accept that.  You lose.  My sex advice for this guy, Bobby.  What is this now?  What do you think?  What are you going to do now?  I have a beautiful girlfriend, bro.  Another day.  Now people are going to fucking listen to you? 
[02:10:30]  Why?  You lost.  You're nothing now.  You're nothing.  Lost?  That wasn't even a fight.  The loser doesn't get to give some kind of speech to that.  He never pinned me.  That's not a lose.  You ran away.  You ran away, dude.  By the way, if you ever run behind me again, I will fuck you up.  And I'm not even joking.  No one comes back here.  I'm sorry.  No one ever comes behind me like that.  I was protecting myself.  I'm sorry.  No, fuck protect yourself.  Yeah, you don't risk Anthony's slobbing.  I'll fucking slam you into the wall.  See, I bought Sam. 
[02:11:00]  I'll go back and just slam right into you.  That's what I should have done if I thought.  No, no.  I wasn't thinking.  I would never intentionally do that.  See you.  Fuck your mother.  See you.  Sorry.  All right, Stevie, I think you blew it.  Bobby doesn't want anything to do.  Am I being too mean?  No.  No.  Okay, Jimmy.  Bye.  This is not over.  I want you to know it.  I'll see you later, buddy.  I'm so over.  You lost.  You're fucking pussy down.  Hopefully we'll never see you again, buddy.  You're pussy down.  Stevie.  He sounds like Bobcat.  Stevie, give Bobby Lee your glasses for a second.  Oh, my God.  He's not going to break your glasses. 
[02:11:30]  What do you want me to do?  What do you want me to do?  Just see how blind he is.  Put him on.  Look how blind he is.  Oh, my God.  That puts you in another dimension.  Now you know what you're dealing with.  Before, I thought you had Down syndrome, but I'm sorry.  It was my bad.  It was my bad, dude.  That's all right.  You, the school, the board of education.  Everyone thought that.  The doctor was a baby.  His sisters.  Yeah, we thought he was a little funny when he first came here.  His sisters are hot, too.  Yeah, he's not a little funny.  Yeah, man.  It's bizarre.  Has anyone gotten in touch with the sisters or anything? 
[02:12:00]  She hasn't accepted my friend request yet.  Nah, she doesn't.  What the fuck's up with that?  She doesn't want anything to do with us.  Why wouldn't the hot 18-year-old want the friend request of this show?  Oh, man.  Which one is she?  I think she's the one on the left.  Oh, man.  Let me see.  How could that be Stevie's fucking sister?  She probably has a club foot.  That's crazy.  Who's the one on the right, by the way?  I like the one on the right, too.  What is that?  Halloween, I guess, huh?  I guess.  Yeah, well, if she ever accepts my friend request.  I hope it's not Halloween.  I like hot girls. 
[02:12:30]  How many friends does she...  She has over 1,000 friends.  Wow.  Yeah, she's popular.  She's doing good.  Fucking Stevie's a piece of shit.  Oh, look at his sister's got, like, a bunch of friends.  And there's Stevie with an Islanders jersey.  How many friends does Stevie have?  He has 489 friends.  489, but he's on a radio show.  He's doing all right.  And look, he's in a dopey Islanders jersey with its dopey head.  Oh, I feel bad, man.  Should I bring Stevie back in here and just apologize?  It's my fault.  Oh, my God.  I come here this morning.  I show him my underwear.  I get all weird.  And then, like...  Yeah, but you just gave him a radio. 
[02:13:00]  He comes in here, and I almost raped the guy.  Are you going to really apologize?  Or is it a twist?  That is down syndrome.  There's no twist.  Oh, then I don't want to hear real apology.  That's...  I'll let it go.  I'll let it go.  How come we can look at his dumb pictures and can't look at his sister's?  That's annoying.  She has her shit locked down, and he doesn't, obviously.  What if I try to befriend her?  I'll try to befriend her.  I'll give you her name.  Be my guest.  Do you watch porno on your phone?  On my iPad, but not on this phone.  On your iPad?  Yeah, yeah.  Why?  I'm just asking.  Because they said you were watching porn in the office or something. 
[02:13:30]  What do you like?  What's your porn of choice?  Okay, this is what I like, and this is a little twisted, but I like new girls.  If I've seen them before, I don't like it.  I like the interviews before, right?  Oh, you do?  Like, this is my first time.  You know what I mean?  I just got off the bus.  And then when the penis enters, in their eyes, I have to have them question their judgment.  You know what I mean?  Like, why did I do this?  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  I hope my mom doesn't.  You know what I mean?  Like, I need that, like, you know, that question.  Yeah.  And then I nut.  You like the cock to be a reality check for them when it goes in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:14:00]  I want it to be real.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I don't like it when they're trying to act.  I like organic.  One time, this guy slapped this girl, right?  And she literally started swinging back as hard as she can.  I love that.  You know what I mean?  Because it's not scripted.  You know what I mean?  It's real.  You know what I mean?  Holy shit.  You know what I mean?  Well, you know, I'm twisted.  You know, I was molested.  Yeah?  Oh, were you?  Oh, my God.  No, but when I was in...  How old were you when you were molested?  I was from seven to ten.  Oh, three years.  Okay.  Three years.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you must have been.  Somebody you knew?  I guess I'm sure.  No, no, no.  Well, in Minnesota, I lived in a place called Edina, Minnesota. 
[02:14:30]  And there was a guy with Down syndrome who used to mow the lawns.  We used to have this ice skating rink, right?  But during the summers, it was like, obviously, it's outside, so it's, you know, grass.  And he used to mow the lawn.  And he had candy in the shack that used to live in.  Oh, candy in the shack.  Yeah, candy's the best.  And he used to lure all these kids with candy, right?  Who's that?  I don't know.  Oh, she's great.  I like stuff like this.  This is wow.  This is the type of point you like.  She'll question.  Wait, I want to hear this story, though.  Yeah, I want to hear this story, too.  Oh, is that?  We could easily go back to that.  Yeah, I want to hear this hot story and not see that mood-killing sexy video. 
[02:15:00]  So there was candy in the shack.  Yeah, so it happened to everyone in the neighborhood, right?  But I went back every day for three summers in a row because I love the candy so much.  What would he do to you?  What?  Just stick your fingers inside me.  You know what I mean?  I would do it, and then I'd get tangy taffy or whatever.  You'd make him.  So you molested him.  I think I might have tricked him.  Would you suck his dick?  No, no, no, no, no.  You put fingers in his ass.  How many?  I don't know.  I had little fingers back then.  Right, right, right, right.  So maybe five. 
[02:15:30]  It was a fist.  It was a fist.  But it was small.  It was very small.  Would you wet the fingers first?  No, no, I wouldn't lube it.  No, that's crazy.  Okay, so you'd put them in, and you'd jerk them off.  I don't even know what that is back then.  You know what I mean?  So you were kneeling.  Obviously, you had to kneel because you had to go up to get the hands or whatever.  And then you were jerking him off, and he would bust wear on you?  No, I don't think he ever bust it, too, because I think he was always nervous, right?  So I think maybe he got a little piece, and then when the kids left, he finished it off.  So would you smell your hand after?  No, no, no.  I wouldn't do that.  No, that's crazy. 
[02:16:00]  By accident, did you get candy?  No, I think I remember there was a creak, and I think I washed my hands a couple of times in the creak.  Creak?  Creak?  Some crawdads died.  But when I was 15 years old, I was in a rehab, right?  And because I did, you know, I'm sober now, right?  So I did drugs at 12, right?  I think maybe it had something to do with the Down syndrome.  What kind of drugs?  I did math back then or whatever, right?  I was living in San...  We moved to San Diego.  And I remember when I was 15, I was in family group therapy, right?  And I said, I mentioned in the group, because my parents were there, I go, yeah, I was molested by this guy with Down syndrome. 
[02:16:30]  And this is when my dad goes, he laughed.  I go, what the hell did that?  He goes, oh, you let him do that?  He's literally starting...  He still reminds me now.  Remember when you had the retard touchy?  Remember that?  I remember that.  Oh, but you were a dumb kid, you know?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  I do it on my stand-up, actually.  We'll talk about that, yeah.  How do you fucking, like, he had Down syndrome?  I think, yeah. 
[02:17:00]  And...  Wait, why were you molested if you were doing it to him?  Is that...  I don't get that.  What's the age difference?  Oh, being molested.  Oh, he was influencing you?  Is that what that's about?  I think...  Yeah, I mean, I think some people just get off when he can get...  It's a power thing, right?  It has nothing to do with sexuality.  He never touched you?  He must have.  I must have.  Yeah, maybe.  He must have touched your ass a little bit.  He probably rubbed it on your butt a little bit.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Rubbed it on your butt.  How old were you?  How old was he, roughly?  Probably 28, 30, maybe.  Oh, he was a man, man.  Okay.  He was a man, yeah.  And you were, like, what, 10?  Eight, nine.  Yeah.  I was riding bikes and stuff.  So he would probably rub it on your butt? 
[02:17:30]  But the thing is, is that...  To any consolation, he's probably dead.  What?  Oh, no.  They don't live that long.  Don't dare me.  What?  Did he ever put it in?  He must try to put it in.  No, no, no.  He never put it in.  He never tried?  No, no, no.  I never had that in me.  Oh, okay.  You know what I mean?  Was it big?  Retards are big dicks.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're very strong, too.  Yes, they are.  Yeah, they're stronger than they look.  Retard strength.  Did you talk about it with any of the other neighborhood kids?  It's like, hey, what about crazy candy guys?  No, but I was never...  Yeah.  No, because I know it happened to my brother.  Oh, he did.  But, you know, he had mentioned it to me a long time ago, but now he denies. 
[02:18:00]  Like, that never happened.  But when I was, like, 12 years ago, he had, you know what I mean?  He was drunk a little bit, and he had really revealed, you know?  Oh, he said...  If he's listening right now, he'll tell me, you know?  Did he say what happened?  Was it the same thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was like a finger fiesta.  But the thing is, is that...  Fingers and jerga of a retard.  But the thing is, is that...  That thing must have been huge in your little hand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't think I felt bad about it.  Yeah.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, I...  You got candy?  It was a fucking deal.  I got candy.  I got a deal. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, you made a bargain with the guy.  And also, I'm like, I'm a drug addict, so...  You know, if I...  I just want to fix myself.  You know what I mean?  So if there's, like, cocaine, right?  I'll do pretty much whatever to get to that cocaine, because it's the fix that I want.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't care about my body or me.  You know what I mean?  But now, you know, I've been sober for a while, you know.  How long are you sober?  Eight years almost.  Oh, okay.  No drinking, no nothing.  Nothing, yeah.  I go to meetings and stuff.  I go to the whole thing.  Very good.  Good for you.  Now we know why you were aggressive with Stevie.  What do you mean?  Because he looks like he might have the downs.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:19:00]  You jumped right on him.  Maybe that was it.  I think that had to be it.  Yeah, because I saw the Special Olympics once, and I had a panic attack watching it.  I thought the finish line was going to be, meet my penis.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I really had a panic attack.  Did you really?  You fucking...  Yeah, I had them pull, it was like, you know what I mean?  I couldn't do it.  So you jumped on him and started humping his ass, like, take that, motherfucker.  No, because that was a defense mechanism.  It's your fault.  And I love you guys, you know that, right?  Yeah.  But I have a defense mechanism when it comes to this place. 
[02:19:30]  I gotta agree.  And maybe it's going to get better and better.  What happened with that?  Well, the first time I came here, you know, you did a practical joke on me, and I was confused.  Right.  Right?  Yeah, yeah.  The second time, there was a man here with his penis out.  Right.  And I spit on it.  Yeah.  Which, my girlfriend at the time was this close to breaking up with me before that.  I forgot about that.  Do you remember that?  I was in a car on my way to the airport, because I saw you, but I missed that segment.  Yeah.  And as I'm listening to it, I'm like, we're fired.  What are we doing?  Oh, really?  Oh, I was patting you. 
[02:20:00]  We're just trying to show you a little love, Bobby.  No, yeah, yeah.  And then we let you look into the asshole of a 54-year-old.  That's why I remember that, too.  Yeah, that was funny.  That's why you ran out last time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't like that at all.  You know what I mean?  You did.  It was like a wrinkly calamari.  You know what I mean?  So we should try to do something different with you, I guess.  No, no.  Things are great now.  No, things are good right now.  Things are good.  I came in aggressively.  Yeah, yeah.  I set the tone, and now we're back into talking.  Well, there's something behind that curtain right now.  What is it?  Well, I don't know.  What is it?  Are you kidding me?  Do you want to see it? 
[02:20:30]  No.  Okay.  Do you really, though?  Do you really?  That's how the whole candy negotiation went, by the way.  That's how it happened.  No, all right.  Bobby, we found your molester, and we want you to reunite with him.  Yeah, confront him.  What kind of candy?  You know with the stick and the little dip?  I remember that.  Sure.  Yeah, because I remember he had the whole, you know, there's like five flavors.  He sucked his dick.  I remember him taking only, you mean only grape or something.  You know what I mean?  But he's like, I wanted all five, but he only got, you'll get, you'll get grape. 
[02:21:00]  But he sticked his dick in the stuff, and then you had to fucking.  No, that's probably it.  There was no stick.  He had his dick in there, and you just sucked it off of his dick.  Very warm stick.  Believe me, there's no way.  Fun dick.  Fun dick.  No way you could have someone's fingers in your ass and just make them jerk it.  You got to get it sucked.  You got to.  Is that what you're.  Look, if you're in the shed.  Why wouldn't he be honest?  I don't think he's lying.  I just think he may be looking at.  Yeah, I don't think Bobby's.  I think he's very honest.  It's not gay if you're doing it for candy, Bobby.  Absolutely.  Can I say something? 
[02:21:30]  Can I say something?  Sure.  That's a very interesting point.  You blocked it out.  No, then I might have blocked it out.  I'm sure I didn't, though.  Because I'm willing to admit fingers in the.  Sure, sure.  You know what I mean?  In the hole.  Yeah.  I'm willing to admit, you know what I mean?  Fondling him, too, a little bit, right?  But I've never had it in my mouth.  Right, right.  Maybe you didn't, but if.  Why would I not go there?  I don't think you're lying.  Was he hard when you were jerking him off, or was he like.  Was he just big and dumb?  No, that was in the 70s.  You know what I mean?  I'm almost 40, right? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  I look great, don't I?  You do look younger.  Thank you so much.  I have my Justin Bieber haircut.  But listen, yeah, I was.  Oh, God.  What are you doing?  Well, he's giving me sugar.  Okay, he just, because he gave me a sugar daddy, as if, because he's giving me candy, because  he has Down syndrome.  He just walked in like.  I don't really.  I'm embarrassed, too.  That was really.  That's rude.  He was trying to act, I think.  Yeah, I don't know what that was.  Stevie came in in his pink suit and threw a sugar daddy at him.  Stevie's really run his course, I think. 
[02:22:30]  He's a little strange.  He's trying.  I should apologize.  We tried to have his mother fucked.  Jesus, give him a break.  I'm going to go apologize.  Yeah, we did.  Bring him in.  Yeah, bring him in.  Stevie.  Bobby, let's go.  Hey, hold up.  Can you stop?  Stop for a second.  Yeah, relax.  Relax.  Just relax.  Breathe.  Breathe through it.  Listen to me, okay?  What's with your pursed lips?  What are you doing?  I like you.  As friends, okay?  Victor.  And I want to apologize for my behavior, okay?  I shouldn't have tried to rape you, but before I had my rainbow bright underwear, I showed  it to you, you got a little weird, and I might have gone overboard. 
[02:23:00]  It wasn't the gay thing.  It was the creepiness of you.  No, no, no.  There's no, there's, you know, just pulling down the pants is creepy.  You know what I mean?  And you should use lip balm, because they're too dry on your lips.  I don't like looking at them.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry my lips are too dry.  We call them Larry Sanders' lips.  He's got Larry Sanders' lips.  Okay, so what do you guys have?  Are you and I cool?  Gary Shandling is Larry Sanders.  Stupid.  Bobby, you want to kiss Stevie just to...  Yeah, are we cool?  No, like a European kiss, not on the lips.  Yeah, European kiss Stevie.  Like, bonjour, you don't mean that kind of a thing. 
[02:23:30]  Like, bonjour.  All right, watch.  No, it's okay.  I'm not into the French, though.  That's the thing.  I'm not going to do...  This is part of the apology, Stevie.  Go to my Facebook, right?  I have a beautiful girlfriend, right?  Don't worry about her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's part of the apology.  See, no, no.  He looked important to me with his lips.  That's weird.  Yeah, that was weird.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bonjour.  Kissed him on the cheek.  You got to do it on the other side now, right?  But Stevie didn't do the...  Hey, good to see you.  Mwah!  On the cheek.  All right, Bobby, you...  Stevie, Stevie, now you do that back to Bobby. 
[02:24:00]  Let's see how you're doing.  Yeah, yeah, let's see how you're doing.  Okay, no, with the bonjour and everything.  Let's do a scene.  We're in a cafe.  We're in a cafe.  You know, you and I went to a university somewhere.  How about in Cambridge?  We went to Cambridge.  I hadn't seen you in a very long time, right?  Because we were lab partners in Cambridge, remember?  And the thing is, is that...  And you see me, and we're both professors now.  So I'm in Paris.  Okay, so come up to me.  Say bonjour.  You got to say bonjour.  Yeah.  Bonjour, bonjour, no.  Yes, hello. 
[02:24:30]  Now kiss Bobby on the cheeks.  I have to do with the...  You got to start over, man.  You messed it all up.  Yeah, you fucked the whole thing up.  You have to commit to it.  Hi, Patrice.  Bonjour, no.  Hello.  Goodness.  Mwah.  Oh, no, that just sucks.  That really sucks.  That sucks.  That totally sucks.  That was terrible.  That was terrible.  Yeah, it was terrible.  Well, don't we commit more?  No, no, no, forget it.  We're done with just Steve.  I gave you the scene, you know what I mean?  Yeah, you fucked all of them.  He did.  He made you a professor.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Bonjour, no.  And, yep.  No, not on the lips.  Not on the lips. 
[02:25:00]  Fucking Bobby.  She tells you, but not the lips.  Fucking Bobby.  Man.  Hello.  We went to Cambridge together.  Bonjour.  There's no Cambridge in there.  Fucking Bobby.  Hold on.  It's a Cambridge.  Hey, Patrice.  Fucking Bobby.  Patrice, here's the scene.  You're a professor.  And Bobby and you haven't seen each other in quite a while.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thank you.  We went to Cambridge together, Patrice.  Red Hook Fire Department. 
[02:25:30]  Thanks.  Nice.  I'm in.  Patrice, sit down, man.  What's the matter?  There's not a lot of room.  I'll leave.  I'll leave.  Stay by the way.  No.  You're not going anywhere, Bobby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Patrice, I'll leave.  Get out of here.  No, no, no, no, no, Bobby.  Stay.  Caroline's on Broadway.  Stay, stay, stay.  We're cool.  10 o'clock.  You're not running out of this car.  What's up, man?  We're not running out this time.  Everything's good.  Everything's good.  Did y'all congratulate Bobby on his Adidas commercial?  Is that what that's about?  No, that's Ken Jeong, first of all.  And that's racist. 
[02:26:00]  That's so racist.  You know it's Ken.  I'm sorry.  You came in with music like that, man.  Adidas commercials everywhere.  No, that's not new.  We thought it was you.  That's why we're having you on today.  No, do you honestly believe that was me?  You just do.  Dude, I'm like Bobby's hitting it big.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That wasn't me.  All right.  The way he was doing it, like...  No, I'm playing Kansas City this week, too.  You know what I mean?  That's where my career is.  Have you seen the commercial?  No.  So thanks.  Thanks, buddy.  And why do you have a fucking Chinese karate movie villain mustache, nigga? 
[02:26:30]  What the fuck's going on?  What's happening, Bobby?  Wait, wait.  First of all, can I say this?  The role is really killing him, man.  It's killing us all.  First of all, this took me nine years to go, by the way.  So that's one thing, okay?  I haven't shaved in nine years.  It's the most not-well-looking mustache I've ever seen by.  But wait 20 years, man.  I'm going to look at Joe Gito.  You know what I mean?  Wait 20 years.  God, man.  He comes...  See, this is what's weird about this show.  That's funny, Bobby.  It's very funny.  I love it.  And he thought you were in the...  He just comes...  I thought that was him. 
[02:27:00]  I was like, Bobby's Bobby Lee...  You're not even kidding?  Bobby Lee is blowing up.  You know, that's the problem with being Asian and on...  You know what I mean?  Being in the limelight because people think you're somebody else.  Well, you should...  Like, I was driving down the street.  Someone would drive by and go, heroes!  Right.  Just, you know what I mean?  And I was like, yeah!  Or something like that.  You know what I mean?  It happened more at all...  I mean, you did well on Hangover.  Was that like...  That was not me, Jim.  That was Ken, the same guy.  That was the same guy.  But you shouldn't have all those roles.  Does that bother you?  No, it doesn't bother me.  Ken's crazy. 
[02:27:30]  I mean, Bobby's crazy.  Ken is not.  Yeah, yeah.  Ken is only crazy when he's acting.  Bobby's always crazy.  Bobby's got a problem.  They might find a fucking...  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Face.  Face in the port-a-polly.  Blue ink on his fucking face when he passed down in the...  Holy shit.  ...porty-potty liquid and shit.  We should do...  You and I should do a movie, Rush Hour 3.  But my point is that...  Ken and I are friends. 
[02:28:00]  We did a tour called The Kim's a Comedy.  That was before Ken blew up, though.  Let's be honest.  Then he blew up, right?  I haven't talked to him since.  You know what I mean?  But I'm happy for him.  No, you're not.  You think secretly I'm not?  Yeah, because your eyes just got wider, Bobby.  Because you know you should be that guy.  You know you should be that guy.  Yeah, but what can you do is people call you and go, why aren't you in...  You know what I mean?  They didn't call me.  Yeah, those are your parts.  They don't call you for that stuff.  No, I mean, I went in for...  Like last week, I went in for Cameron Crowe, right? 
[02:28:30]  And we talked for like 20 minutes, and I auditioned for him.  He taped me.  And afterwards, he was like, that's great.  I got things.  He's like, you know how you say a line, and he was like behind the camera going like this?  Give me a thumbs up.  And I drive home, I think I got that.  I got it, right.  Didn't get it.  And that's 10 times a year that happens.  Who got it?  I don't know.  Ken Jeong.  I probably can, but my point is that...  Matter of fact, when he went to read, it said, can you be like Ken Jeong?  He's a type now.  Once he's become a type, it's over with. 
[02:29:00]  But Patrice is doing this to him, and...  It's the same thing.  People say Craig Robinson to you.  At times.  They say everything to me, but they...  You should have a lot of those Craig Robinson roles.  So that's...  You feel for it.  I'm almost like I'm sad and happy for Bobby at the same time.  Like, I'm happy that he goes through the same bullshit.  But we got stand-up.  You know what I mean?  And...  Ken does too, though.  I know, but you look at Ken and Craig.  They're both great guys.  They're great guys, but they're not...  You know what I mean?  They don't...  Don't say it.  I'm not going to say it.  You're not a bridge-burning guy.  No, no, no, I'm not going to say it. 
[02:29:30]  Bobby, I know what you're going to say.  I'm not going to burn bridges.  I'm not going to burn bridges.  I'll say it.  Patrice is way funnier than Craig Robinson.  No, that's not what I'm saying.  That's not what I'm saying.  I know what you're trying to say.  No, what I'm saying is that you and I are at clubs every night, working it out.  Doing your thing.  Just don't do the political.  Just don't even go there.  Did I not separate?  We know what you're going to say.  We feel you.  Yeah, Bobby, shut up.  You're already a minority.  Don't make it worse for yourself.  No, I'm not...  I'm trying to save you.  We're trying to save you.  Shut up.  Just shut the fuck up, Bobby.  No, no, no.  I just want to say this.  Can I just say this?  Can I just say this?  Sure. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  I like...  I love both those guys with my heart.  But, you know...  You know, he sounds like Mike Shanahan.  I just puked in my mouth.  I just puked in my mouth.  And I'm just saying that...  Okay, here's what I'm saying, okay?  Say it.  We're screwed.  You and I, we're screwed.  Why, though?  You guys should be doing fucking big projects, man.  Yeah, this is how...  You gotta be nice, man.  You just...  I realize it's way too late.  See, why was he the guy in the office, though?  In the fucking stock room down there? 
[02:30:30]  You two were both in there.  Because he was...  And then he ends up being the guy.  And they went with him.  Craig...  Craig...  Craig was...  He didn't...  His energy is perfect.  Like, and I say that knowing that your energy is supposed to be perfect.  And my energy was...  Look, aloof is being an asshole.  When you're trying to protect people from yourself...  I thought you were doing a great job.  Yeah, absolutely.  Like, you were the guy that should have been in that stock room. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, I was.  But that's why I couldn't...  I couldn't...  I'm not gonna say that I didn't do it anymore, but when they would call, I just wasn't available.  And it's because I couldn't do 16 hours of what Norton was doing with fucking the Coppola kid today.  I just can't do that for more than 30 seconds of bald taint licking about how much I love you.  Boy, I like the guy.  Stop licking your wrinkled face, stupid.  I like the guy.  It's better off.  What he was doing, genuine, not genuine, that is what you have to have, man. 
[02:31:30]  And you can't do that.  You can't play that game.  It seems fucked up.  Bobby, I have an example.  I know exactly what you're saying.  Go ahead, Bobby.  Ken and I were in Pineapple Express.  We had one line apiece, okay?  So I show up to work, okay?  And Ken and I don't have dressing rooms.  We're in the stable with 30 other ninjas, right?  And I'm with, you know what I mean?  There are little people with ninja masks on.  And I'm in a little horse stable, like leaning against the thing. 
[02:32:00]  I go, I don't get a trailer?  I was on a show for eight years.  So I called my agent, right?  And I said, listen, I'm leaving if I don't get a trailer.  I saw Rosie Perez have a driver.  You know what I mean?  And if we go to a mall, I get recognized too.  So I want a trailer.  So then later, I think I got the vibe of being a troublemaker because I demanded a trailer.  You know what I mean?  Because I didn't want to be in a stable with 30 gooks.  I relate to them. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  Can I say gooks?  Or I may not say it.  You're allowed to say that.  Pan-faced gooks.  Let me say something.  The adjective is too much.  But my point is this, okay?  Is that I just feel like I've done a certain amount of work.  You know what I mean?  You know, as a stand-up, the night show, all the stuff, sketch show, whatever, movies.  I want a little trailer.  You're not asking for much.  You shouldn't have been with the rest of every ninja guy.  Yeah, these stunt guys.  Can I say, though?  Yeah.  In defense and in prosecution of him, he really don't know that that's enough. 
[02:33:00]  That's where the problem is, is that it's not a middle ground.  It's not a compromise.  This is why I know that that Mel Gibson bullshit was bullshit as soon as I heard that the crew  was against them.  Because I've been on enough sets to know crews are the subordinates.  They do what the fucking director says.  There's no cameraman that goes, I will not work with Mel Gibson.  I know that. 
[02:33:30]  There's no makeup.  They are against.  It's a pecking order.  And they know it.  And they treat the people like shit that they can.  Mel Gibson don't get treated like shit by no fucking crew.  So that's how I know this was something that was given permission by others for them to  fucking stand up and rise up against fucking Braveheart and Apocalypto guy.  There's nobody in Hollywood with enough balls to stand on their own to go, I refuse to do 
[02:34:00]  that.  So that's how I know.  So it's easy to be.  If you're not like, hey, everybody, you're an asshole.  And you're not working.  But I'm not saying I don't want to be.  I'm saying sometimes I sit in the corner, try to be quiet.  And it comes off like, who's this quiet, fat nigga with an attitude?  That's what I did on The Office.  So because I didn't want to spoil anybody's fucking day.  But here's what they do.  They always want to fucking be around you. 
[02:34:30]  They want to be around the aloof asshole.  Like, hey, guy.  And I'm like, oh, what the fuck?  You can't just sit there and go, hey, how you doing?  You have to be, I want to be, how are you?  But the conversation, I feel like John Doe from Seven.  Like, writing it that today, this guy said, hello, I wanted to throw up.  And just, you just go, why can't you just push that deep for a day?  Knowing what it'll get you. 
[02:35:00]  Many times, you know what, here's what it'll get you.  We did the damn, what's the movie there?  Furry Vengeance.  Furry Vengeance.  Brandon, Brendan Frazier and Brooke Shields love that shit.  They love the reality of who we were.  They was just drawn to it.  And people would go, why is Brooke Shields and Brendan sitting with those guys?  They're just the construction guys who don't talk.  No, we're not.  We're a-personality motherfuckers who is getting treated like dog shit by the goddamn sock girl 
[02:35:30]  because they think we're extras, bitch.  You better get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, one time I booked a movie.  I hear you now.  And the lady sent me to the extras camp.  I showed up.  Oh, shit.  And she goes, yeah, you're over there, right?  So I went over there with like a hundred people.  Like they were in a stadium.  Like it's shot.  And I'm trying to check in and this and that.  And I go, I think I have lines.  Like into my, you know what I mean?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  And then I say to the lady later, I go, I think I have lines. 
[02:36:00]  And she goes, oh, you're Bobby Lee?  I go, yeah.  And then she got mad at me.  Like, why didn't you?  You're an asshole.  Yeah.  Why didn't you tell me?  You're an asshole.  Like, I'm the jerk.  And he tried not to be an asshole.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then I turned out to be an asshole.  You know what I mean?  He's fighting.  What a weird world, man.  You can't win it.  You can't win it.  So you have to.  It's either hook or crook.  Hook or crook.  He's the boss on his shit.  And it trickles down from him.  That's the only chance.  You always got to, as I say, pick your battles. 
[02:36:30]  Like a lot of times if I have an issue with a club or a theater, my agent and I will talk.  He goes, all right, look, we can do this and take this.  Or he goes, if you want, I'll go back and beat him up.  For whatever it is we're probably entitled to.  He goes, if you want to do that, I will.  But they did this and this.  It's like, you got to pick your battles.  Sometimes it's worth really fighting for it.  Other times it's like, eh, that one's not a big deal.  But Norton, we're not even saying battles.  No, I'm only saying that.  It's just a natural, just basic shit.  Yeah.  It stinks in my trailer.  Oh!  I'm thinking about our shitty trailers that we had honey wagons for two weeks. 
[02:37:00]  Which was, we should not have had honey wagons.  We should have had fucking trailers when we did Furry Vengeance.  We were in those little teeny honey wagons.  And it was either I was going to stay there and hate it or quit or just accept it.  Because they weren't going to give us trailers.  And there's no sense of humor.  There's no mean sarcasm sense of humor.  It's, there's nothing there.  You have to, there's not like.  How is that possible?  Like, you can't even go, what the fuck?  Nigga, I got hemorrhoids for sitting in this trailer so long.  Oh, boy.  Like, I get it. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, boy.  You're in trouble, man.  I'm just joking.  Dude, they called my manager that day and said, does this guy have a problem?  Because I was in the honey wagon.  Holy shit.  So I was sitting on that stress all day.  So I just said something to the old fucking, what is his name?  Roger.  Yeah.  And I go, man, what the fuck?  Because that's my sense of humor.  He's looking with that.  Everything's okay.  And then, what's going on with this thing that's talking to me?  It's like, I was just fucking with you, nigga.  This thing that's talking to me?  My ass hurts. 
[02:38:00]  And now it's like, all right, be funny.  One line construction worker in this shitty movie.  Like, can I be a human?  No, you cannot.  No, you fucking can't.  We went into the house together to meet the director.  Me and Patrice came down.  We were sitting for hours.  And we're sitting at a table in the dining room in the house.  And the director's talking to us.  And Patrice is like, I forget what you were saying,  but I felt like the wife watching her husband have his third drink  and his fourth drink.  And I was like, ah, boy, here it goes. 
[02:38:30]  And you know you're being lumped into the whole thing.  I just watch it.  But I'm like the happy one.  I'm like, yeah, yeah, no, no.  We'll come back tomorrow.  We'll come back tomorrow.  We'll come back tomorrow.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  All right, listen.  Oh, that is great.  We should take a quick break.  We got Danny Putty from Community outside the studio as well.  You're not leaving, Bob.  No, this is good.  This is good.  You have Danny coming in.  I could kill you.  No, hang out, Bob.  I can't have a cigarette, because we'll have a cigarette at least.  Hang out.  Please hang out.  You don't smoke anymore.  I don't smoke anymore.  You don't smoke anymore.  No, no, you don't smoke. 
[02:39:00]  Just hang out.  All right.  You're being difficult.  You're being difficult.  No, no.  I don't think I am.  We're just trying to make it different for you, Bobbie Lee.  He's been an asshole.  Like I was listening to that interview, Jason Schwartzman.  Yeah.  That guy is an Oscar winner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just because that fucker is, he knows.  I think he was genuine, though, in his niceness.  I'm not saying he's a phony.  I'm saying that his niceness is perfection.  I'm not saying he's phony. 
[02:39:30]  It's just perfection.  But you don't have that in you even to put on.  I pray for that.  And you need that to really make it in Hollywood.  Yeah, I don't think I'm going to either.  Well, it makes you, it's like even if there was a problem on the set, Jason, he's a guy  who would, I'm sure, address it, but he's not going to come off and make anybody uncomfortable.  Gotcha.  He would address it very nicely and differently.  He wouldn't come out and just go like, what the fuck is.  Right.  Like you asked him a specific, let me tell you what he did real quick that was tremendously  fantastic.  You asked him a question about, have you been around where people, Lily Tomlund, okay? 
[02:40:00]  He didn't ask, answer that, but he gave you a more interesting watermelon story as a, as  a, as a, as a, I'll give you this.  I'll give you this instead of saying any names that could fucking harm my career.  Wow.  Genius.  And my fat ass will go, yeah, uh, old stupid ass motherfucking Steve Martin, I caught  him something, I'm plunging his own ass.  And you would have been like, yeah, Lily Tomlund's a cunt. 
[02:40:30]  And I saw it myself.  She's got a lot of pussy hands.  All right, listen, Bobby's not leaving.  I might leave.  Bobby.  Stop.  Stop.  I need to put my shoes on.  Bobby, hang out.  All right, you can put your shoes on, but don't leave, because he's going to leave.  No, I'm not.  I'm going to put my shoes on.  Hide his shoes.  Bobby.  Caroline's one more time.  Yes, we're going to.  No, no, no, no plugging, no plugging until we get back.  When is Caroline's?  Your plug is the most confusing thing.  It is tonight, Caroline's?  Tonight, 10 o'clock.  All right, 10 o'clock tonight at Caroline's. 
[02:41:00]  If you're in the area, go see Bobby Lee.  He's unbelievable.  We love this guy.  Thank you.  I don't know if he loves us yet.  You know I love you.  He's confused by us.  I totally love you guys.  But we're trying to work this out.  Tonight at Caroline's is Bobby.  It's jokes.com.  Stand up for the New York Comedy Festival.  Also, I've never on radio have ever said that I was molested by a guy with Down syndrome.  Yes.  This is the first time I've ever...  Because I feel comfortable here.  I think TMZ is going to pick that up today.  No, they won't.  And when are you taping? 
[02:41:30]  Friday night.  All right.  So is it an hour or half hour?  Hour.  Oh, it is an hour.  All right, good.  So just you?  Just me.  Skirball Theater.  It's in the village.  It's where we did the HBO half hours.  Oh, nice.  It's a fucking great theater.  It's Washington Square Park South.  It's by the cellar.  I want to go, but if you go, then they make you stay there for eight hours.  It's a nightmare.  Can I just sneak in?  It's a one hour, dude.  It's a one hour.  No, but how they have to look at the audience and go, oh, that fucking guy can't be next  to that fucking guy.  No, it's just two shows.  It's like I got it like a regular show. 
[02:42:00]  It's not a...  Have you been through one of these?  It's unbelievable how they study the crowd for an hour and have to set everyone perfectly  right.  So it's only an hour?  I think it was for Bill Burr or somebody.  It was like, oh, my God.  It's a great theater.  Don't get me wrong and all that.  And you're going to do fine.  But, you know.  But I taped the hour.  I want to support you.  I just don't want to be an audience member for eight straight hours.  Well, I'm glad that you destroyed the fourth wall for any idiot that didn't know that  that's what they're going to go through when they come as they cancel all the free  tickets they got.  No.  They're not going to do it like that. 
[02:42:30]  It's going to be a regular show.  All right.  When I did my special...  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do it to blow your spot.  When I did the special, they did a little bit of seating up the front.  They wanted to just look a certain way.  And I went ballistic backstage.  I'm like, you tell that fucking audience coordinator that I want fucking mullets.  I don't want a pretty audience.  I wanted what...  And then they did.  Two weeks ago, I'm like, I need...  But then they did it.  So you set up nice.  Because I think it's interesting for the people. 
[02:43:00]  They really studied the audience and go, oh, you're not pretty enough to sit in the first  five rows.  Oh, yeah.  I told them I don't want it to look like the Comedy Central.  We're switching people.  We're switching you.  You sit back there.  It's unbelievable.  And I'm looking like, does that really fucking matter in the end?  Did I get that for his hour that you guys was at?  No, the first one in DC, they...  It didn't delay the show at all.  It's when you're coming in.  They're just like, okay, we'll put you guys here.  But I said to them after, because I was looking down to the front row.  There were some pretty girls.  They were fine.  But they were not fucking hardcore Jim Norton fans. 
[02:43:30]  I'm like, I want the fucking people that would have paid to see me in the front.  And they did.  But I screamed at that.  Yeah, this one seems that it's going to be...  It's not going to be a TV taping.  It's a show show.  It's a Friday night.  It's easy.  You're in.  You're doing an hour.  You're out.  You got tickets to give away?  I think ten more.  And if somebody wants some more.  I got...  They're all gone, but I have like a hundred.  I gave you guys 40.  And then I think there's another like 30 left.  How are we giving away, Danny?  They can call him.  Yeah, people call in.  It's Friday night here in the Village.  Two shows.  It's like going to see a headline show.  Yeah, all right.  The number's on the pad.  Data. 
[02:44:00]  Call if you want to see Patrice this Friday night in New York City.  All right?  Simple as that.  Yeah.  For taping.  We'll give a few away.  Yeah, it's going to...  Patrice is very excited about this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually.  All right.  Follow the O.B. and Anthony Show on Twitter.  Twitter.com slash O.B. Radio.  Anthony.  Twitter.com slash Anthony Cumia.  And little Jimmy Norton.  Twitter.com slash Jim Norton.  Got a full house today.  Bobby Lee in studio playing Carolines tonight. 
[02:44:30]  I'm still confused by your blood.  I don't even know what it is.  It's written so fucked up.  It's at 10 o'clock.  It's at 10 o'clock.  At Carolines, right?  At Carolines.  Come at 9.30.  All right.  It's a live stream for Comedy Central.  It's jokes.com.  Okay.  And they get to see a show for an hour and a half.  Okay.  And it'll be online as well.  That's what it says.  It's only online.  It's only online.  But I mean, if you were there, you're also seeing you live.  Well, if you see it live, yeah.  Yeah, I'm confused.  Me too.  Have fun tonight.  I don't know.  They told me to come.  I came.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And then we got Patrice O'Neill, who's got the big taping this Friday. 
[02:45:00]  We want to make sure the house is filled for Patrice this Friday night.  People are calling to win their tickets now.  We could even give more away right now.  Just call the pad data number.  And also, now we got Danny Putty in studio from Community.  How are you, sir?  Yay.  Hey, everybody.  What's happening?  What's happening?  And you're in the back of the room, and we apologize ahead of time.  Danny, you want to sit here?  I like being in the back.  No, because if I'm in the back, I can escape.  No, that's right.  I need an escape room. 
[02:45:30]  No, that's more of a commitment up there.  Back here's kind of nice.  I get to kind of feel out the mood, see what the tone is up there.  No escape for you.  You've got to stay here.  No, I'm here.  I'm here.  How long have you been here, Bobby?  I've been here, well, Jason Schwartzman was here for...  The longest he's ever been here.  Yeah, yeah, I'm doing better.  Bobby usually bolts out the door in some fucking...  But Danny, I came in aggressively.  I came in with my underwear.  Someone told me you were showing your underwear.  Yeah, my rainbow-by-underwear, and I wrestled a guy that looks like it down.  Is it stripper underwear with a little pouch?  What do we got?  We have a history of Bobby, like... 
[02:46:00]  We have a big history.  We've made him run out of here many times.  Dude, it was the worst.  And we didn't even realize we were doing that to him.  Clothed?  What?  Do you always run out naked?  No, no, no.  I don't know this.  No, I spit on a guy's penis once here.  Yeah.  Inside the studio?  Yeah, inside.  Whose dick was that?  Was that Bobo's?  It was Bobo's.  It was Bobo's.  It was twisted.  His penis was twisted.  Yeah, yeah.  Like a roller coaster.  It looked like a dog had chewed it.  Like a red vine.  Yeah, yeah.  It was really bad.  It was not good.  Yeah, exactly.  Really bad.  I don't like red vines anymore. 
[02:46:30]  Bobby!  Yeah.  There might have been another...  Patrice comes in, right?  Patrice comes in, and he says that I was in the Adidas commercial, that I have a campaign.  Fast!  He's fast!  He's on the show with Danny.  Ken Jeong.  Ken Jeong's on the show with Danny.  He's on the show?  He's a regular?  Yeah.  Ken Jeong, man.  Ben Chang.  El Tigre.  El Tigre.  He blew up.  He blew up.  And quite frankly, no bullshit other than karate.  I've never... 
[02:47:00]  Well, Lucy Liu, and she's some half type of chick with freckles and shit.  Oh, she's gorgeous.  I like her.  But I've never heard of an Asian guy blowing up.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, this is fucking unprecedented, man.  If Ken Jeong was sitting there, he would have offered me a seat, too.  Great guy.  Yeah, yeah.  That probably tear you.  First of all, I just did.  I offered you the seat.  I offered you the seat.  And then you'd betray me like that?  Nah, but you fucked up.  I'm telling you what you didn't do.  These are life lessons.  You should have got the fuck up.  You don't want a life lesson from Bobby L.A.  You don't want a life lesson, man.  You don't want a life lesson from Bobby L.A., trust me. 
[02:47:30]  Nice 101.  You should have got up and insisted and pushed.  That gets you parts.  Yes, you fucked up.  No, no, no.  I don't care.  I'm at a point now where I don't...  You know what?  I walk out of auditions.  No, I walk out of auditions.  You walk out of auditions?  If I sit there and there's 20 other Asian guys in, like, samurai outfits, and I look  around, I will leave.  You know what I mean?  I'm not getting it.  Same thing.  Me in lab coats, man.  Really?  That's it?  Yeah, because they treat you like you've never done anything. 
[02:48:00]  You know what I mean?  I come in.  There's 30...  Can I say pan-faced gooks?  I'm going to say it, right?  I just said it.  I just said it, right?  They have pan-faced.  I'm in the back.  I'm in the back.  You're in the back, right?  And these are all guys that have never done anything.  You know what I mean?  And I sit there, and they kind of look at me.  What's up, dude?  Don't...  Come on, man.  You're half.  I don't think I'm better than them.  You are above that.  No, I don't think I'm above that.  I'm just saying, though, that...  Here's a problem, though.  Uh-oh.  This is a big problem.  Uh-oh.  What's your name again, brother?  Danny.  Danny.  I just asked Danny, is he Indian? 
[02:48:30]  And he's like, yeah.  The weird thing about the Asian, the Chinese thing is that there's not the day of the China  guy.  It's just Ken Jeong.  Right now, it's fucking Indian guy season.  Like, there's spots for a bunch of motherfucking Indian guys, man.  Russell, Aziz, Danny Boy.  Then you got the dude from The Office.  All right.  Who's...  Mindy Kaling, the girl? 
[02:49:00]  No, the dude.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And a new girl on SNL.  And there's a new show.  There's a show with Indians in it.  The whole thing is fucking outsourced.  Indians are working.  Yeah, Indians are the new big thing.  But Asians ain't working.  It's just Ken Jeong.  Why no love for the Asians, Bobby?  Because I think I have a weird vibe out there.  You're doing it for everyone, I'm thinking.  Well, you know, when I was on MADtv, I pooped in somebody at a producer's room, on the floor.  Life lesson.  Why did you do that?  Did you do that?  Life lesson.  Life lesson.  I get it now.  Because I was betrayed. 
[02:49:30]  You know what I mean?  So for me, it's like, I don't have the thing where it's like, I don't think I should poop  in the producer's room.  I think I need revenge.  How did he betray you?  Because what happened was, they had Jackie Chan on the show, right?  So I wrote a letter to the producer saying, I don't care what it is.  I'm on the show.  I want to be in the sketch.  They shot it without me, right?  Wow.  So I found that.  I thought that was a betrayal.  Did someone play you?  And somebody pooped in their dressing room.  Did they not win two Asians?  Yeah.  Is that too much?  No, I didn't think it was a scheduling thing.  I don't know what the hell the deal was.  I don't care, right? 
[02:50:00]  It was deception.  And I'm going to poop in your room.  Bobby, you ever...  Therapy?  Were you ever offered SNL?  No.  Because you were on Mad TV, probably, right?  Yeah, I was on Mad TV for too long, I think.  I was on it for almost eight years.  Eight years?  Oh, then you were the brand.  That's it.  Yeah, yeah.  After eight years.  I know you were...  Nobody from Mad is like...  But I'm thinking...  That's okay.  They must hate the Mad guys.  But I saw the Mike McDonald special on Showtime.  Yeah.  He's a Mad motherfucker, too.  He's an edgy guy, man.  Yeah.  These guys, these Mad TV guys are...  We're edgy. 
[02:50:30]  One thing, too, about Ken.  Ken is traditional Asian, dude.  He goes in character.  Bobby's a problem, man.  Nobody...  Bobby makes people nervous.  Bobby's pooping in drawers, and I'm not here with his other one.  And he opens his fucking mouth.  He opens his mouth about fucking Carlos.  It's like...  It's dangerous to be a guy that opens your fucking mouth in this game.  Why can't you keep your mouth shut, Bobby?  No, that's not...  That's unfair.  First of all...  He's gonna...  You said something.  No, no, no. 
[02:51:00]  I'm not being combative.  I'm not being combative, all right?  All right.  But what I'm saying...  Let your hands...  Your hands are too little to hold those stars.  That's crazy.  The Chinese stars in there?  Is that what you mean?  I can hold the blowgun.  Are you gonna do my life lesson?  Life lessons.  Life lessons.  Yes.  With one hand while there's fingers in the ass.  I'm gonna tell you the reality of that situation, though, okay?  There was a time when Joe Rogan was there every night, and he had this other guy from Red 
[02:51:30]  Bandits, an internet guy, filming everywhere, right?  He was filming everywhere.  He does the podcast.  So I didn't even see him filming.  So Joe comes up, he says it, and I'm just nonchalantly, like I would say anything...  It's some Mel Gibson shit.  Yeah, some Mel Gibson stuff, right?  And that was back when I was using it, too.  I was drinking.  That was a long time ago.  That was footage from a very long time ago.  So I feel like I was screwed now.  With Mencia and Rogan, we're all cool.  You know what I mean?  But that was an awful time ago. 
[02:52:00]  Are Mencia and Rogan cool?  No.  Oh, I didn't think so.  No.  Never.  Never.  Never, never.  Well, I don't think that Joe would want it either.  I don't think he'd want it either.  No, no, no.  I feel bad for Mencia now, man.  Really?  Yeah.  I just feel bad.  He's a friend, you know what I mean?  Well, it kind of all came out and got very ugly for him, and then what happened?  And how did he handle it?  I've seen it.  I saw him on a plane, but I think Mencia, I think Comedy Central, because of all the  letters and stuff, and because of that fiasco, ultimately made a decision to let the show 
[02:52:30]  go.  And I think that, I mean, I don't want to get into if he steals or not steals.  He said he did, though.  Well, he's admitted it.  Okay, okay.  Well, you know, I'm still not going to get into it, because I almost had the Mexican  mafia.  I almost had the Mexican mafia.  He just wants to be, he desperately wants to be a nice guy.  But you missed what he said.  You missed what he said.  There is a Mencia mafia.  What do you mean?  I've seen it.  Really?  A Mencia mafia.  And he's got a lot of guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, man.  Cousins and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, with tattoos.  When the tattoo's on the neck, I don't screw with that. 
[02:53:00]  I don't screw with that.  That's not a level of commitment.  Wait a minute.  He has, he has people, but, but are you saying who he is or Mexicans?  No.  Probably people that love him.  Well, that's not a Mexican.  Well, he's a fucking, he's a, he's like some type of fucking Iranian or something.  No, no, no, no.  He's not Iranian.  Here's the story, dude.  He's had, he grew up in Honduras, because I went to his village.  You know, I went to the Mencia village.  No electricity, no running water.  His dad was German, right?  Had sex with a Honduran lady, right?  Took off.  So he's German in Honduras. 
[02:53:30]  As you're telling his whole family's fuck story.  See, Bobby just needs to leave.  I'm going to leave.  I'm going to leave.  I'm going to leave.  Bobby!  Bobby!  Bobby!  Bobby!  Bobby!  Bobby!  Bobby!  Bobby, come here!  Bobby, stay!  No, no, you're not!  Come here, Bobby!  Come here, Bobby!  He's just one of his fucking minds.  We got an empty seat here.  Yeah, you might as well step up.  I don't want to sit in that seat.  It's cursed.  Bobby can't just leave happily.  He leaves.  What is that about?  We were getting along every goddamn time.  But he's done. 
[02:54:00]  He's done.  He's crazy.  He'll never come back.  He won't come back.  But not tonight.  Yeah, he'll come back.  He's done for the day.  Yeah, he's done for the day.  I don't get it either.  But he's not.  No one's vilifying this motherfucker.  I don't care.  No, no.  He's like, no, I'm the bad guy.  I'm the bad guy.  I'm the bad guy.  I'm the bad guy.  And he leaves.  But here's what I'm trying to help him with.  Yeah, shut the fuck up.  He's not aware of his problem.  No.  I just saw him go through another door.  He's going.  But it's like, Bobby, you're going worse.  He tried to not say something. 
[02:54:30]  And by not saying something, he was saying worse shit.  I'm just curious about his trip to that village.  Why was he there?  What was going on with that?  Why was he in the village of Mencia?  And he knew everything.  He's coming back.  Is he coming back?  Come on, Bobby.  Wait, we can hear.  Hey, Bobby.  Wait, wait.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, man.  Okay, I just want to say this, though.  Can I just say this?  No, no, no.  Let me explain.  No, no.  Let me explain.  No.  No.  Let me explain to you, Bobby.  Let me explain to you what I'm doing. 
[02:55:00]  Hey, Bobby, I saved your seat.  Let me explain to you what I did.  Okay, can I say something?  I'm being honest, too.  I'm not lying.  I don't even lie.  I'm saying what I was doing is trying to help you understand.  No, you're not helping me understand.  That when you're easy, whatever seven voices is going on now, just voice.  Feel it down.  Listen, Bobby.  I'm saying.  Breathe.  Breathe.  No, don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  I'm not trying to.  I like you, but don't touch me.  I'm not going to touch you.  All right.  But you're putting your hands too close to me.  No problem.  No problem.  No, I love you.  No, I love you, though.  Patrice, I don't want a life lesson.  You don't want a life lesson. 
[02:55:30]  Can I say this?  No, Patrice.  Here's what it is.  My dry cleaner's naked when he's taking my phone.  So I'm saying that I was.  I know what you're thinking.  I'm saying that I was saying this is why you are.  You're not aware that you think you're being nice, right?  But what's happening is you are.  This is asshole-ness what you're doing by mistake.  You are a natural, uncomfortable guy.  And I'm trying to say, see what you're doing here by trying to say not things. 
[02:56:00]  You're saying other things.  That's all I'm trying to say.  I'm not trying to play you out.  Oh, so Bobby's an asshole.  Oh, so you're saying.  But the thing is, can I say this, though?  All right?  All right.  All right.  And I'm not.  Because basically what you're saying is that I'm an asshole.  Ooh.  Yes.  But I'm saying it naturally, though.  I'm saying it's not malicious.  It's not malicious.  It's not malicious.  I should feel good because I'm a natural asshole.  I was born this way.  Not that you should feel good.  You should embrace it and say that's what it is. 
[02:56:30]  Bobby, here's the example that was given.  What you were doing was you didn't want to say certain things about Carlos.  Yeah.  And in trying not to say it, you filled up that time with saying worse things.  What did I say?  That was bad.  This German father fucking this Honduran mother.  Ooh, the village.  The village with no electricity or water.  But maybe he doesn't look at it that way.  You don't even know why you were there.  No, first of all, Mencia finds that embracing, right?  He doesn't deny it.  He's talked about it.  He flew me out there to show me.  Why were you in this village?  He goes, hey, dude, you want to come see the village I grew up in? 
[02:57:00]  So I go, yeah.  And we flew out there.  We took a little raft, you know what I mean, to get to it.  You know what I mean?  I stayed for three weeks.  I waited.  You know, I never mentioned Carlos Steele and ever.  That whole thing.  I kept my mouth until I seen a thing where he admitted it.  Admitted it.  And maybe they edited it, but he admitted it and he seemed proud of it.  And that's when I started kind of like going, wow, man.  You know, Joe saw it.  But when you admit it and the way they showed it where he's like, yeah, I do it and I remix 
[02:57:30]  it and I'm going to take your shit as if that's what comedians do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't like that.  He kind of said that's what, yeah, that's what everyone does anyway.  He's a nice guy.  Yeah.  Have you met him?  He's a very nice guy.  Yeah.  I know Carlos.  Yeah.  I like Carlos a lot.  When I was poor, he bought me a car and I was just an open miker.  I didn't have a car.  Fair enough.  He's a nice guy.  He's a nice guy.  And I'm a bad friend because I'm an asshole.  Is that what you're saying, Patrice?  No.  And let me say this.  Probably so.  I want to defend myself. 
[02:58:00]  Patrice is kind of saying that.  Okay.  But here's what I want to say.  I don't know why.  But here's what I want to say.  Sorry, Danny.  But the community is okay.  I like this.  What time does this show come on, by the way?  Thursdays, 8 o'clock.  8 p.m.  Tomorrow night.  Oh, the big Thursdays.  Yeah.  Show's huge.  Patrice, obviously, I've done, you know what I mean, movies and I've done TV stuff.  First of all, before you finish this, before you finish, do you understand the context  first that I've tried to explain?  No, I don't completely, completely confused.  No, not really.  You understand my context.  No, no, no, no, please, please clear it up because right now I'm sweating.  Mom, Dad, stop fighting.  The context is this. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's self-awareness is what I'm saying.  I don't have self-awareness.  I don't have self-awareness.  I don't have self-awareness.  That shit.  You all right, Bobby?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Let me stop.  Go ahead, man.  What did you do in the village?  Yeah, what was going on?  And you were talking about iguanas or something?  Yeah, what happened?  What did you do in the village?  There was no running water or electricity in his village, right?  And he admits to it, you know what I mean?  How long were you there?  I was there for like two or three weeks.  So what did you do in the village?  Why would you go there for two or three weeks?  Because he bought him a car.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How did you spend your time, Bobby?  What did you do?  I got a fucking answer. 
[02:59:00]  He gave me a bottle of muscatel.  I got a fucking...  You and I have to do shit.  We played ping pong.  You played ping pong?  We played ping pong in the village.  For three weeks?  Yeah, for three weeks.  And when they also...  No water, really?  You had no water?  But they had ping pong.  They had flow, you know, the river, the flowing river.  And you killed a pig?  No, they did.  I was a five-in-one.  They woke me up to see it.  You fucked a pig.  I didn't fuck one.  I've never fucked an animal, ever.  No.  I'm not fucking Bobby's face.  After everything, I spit on a dick, fingers, and ass. 
[02:59:30]  How dare you fucking say I fucked a goddamn pig.  I'll kill one of you motherfuckers.  All right, you know what?  No, Bobby.  Because what he's saying is this, okay?  And I'm a huge fan of Patrice, okay?  All right, yeah.  But this is what...  And I think I misunderstood what he's saying.  But this is what I'm getting from it, okay?  That I'm a volatile person.  Ooh.  Right?  I was born fucked up.  Like, I have no sense of, like, you know what I mean?  Social, you know.  Right?  Yeah.  And you know what that means to me?  And part of that is because he's Asian, dude, too, by the way. 
[03:00:00]  I have an Asian fish guy.  Asian people are socially...  All right, that's it.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  That's the second one.  Bobby, Bobby!  Bobby.  I'm gonna get to some sleep.  Where you going?  Oh, man.  You're basically saying it's a cultural thing.  It's 10 at night in China.  You don't need to go anywhere in the swim.  I'm Korean, first of all.  You think that...  That's hilarious.  But my point is this, okay?  Can I say this?  You're saying it's a cultural thing that we just talk shit. 
[03:00:30]  No!  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I talk shit.  You're adding extra shit.  You know what I mean?  I'm saying it's a cultural thing, but then you add to talk shit.  Can I say this?  I'm on your side.  No, no, no.  You're on my side.  You're my enemy right now, but my point is this, okay?  You're part of this whole thing.  And they never...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're part of the whole thing, but let me say something, okay?  The whole thing.  The reason why I am the way I am here, right, is because I have to come in here with my defense  mechanisms.  That's fair.  And the thing is, is that, so I just keep talking, right, so that, and what it is,  I just fucked myself. 
[03:01:00]  Basically, what it is, is that what I'm doing is, I'm holding the gun backwards.  And I'm shooting myself.  Turn it.  And I gotta turn it.  Turn it, Bobby.  I gotta turn it on.  Come on, man.  Just put it up or down.  Put it down.  You came in here and you got naked.  That seems good.  What?  That's insane.  Wait, you were naked first?  He was naked.  I was naked.  Twice.  Was that a defense mechanism?  Bobby, it scares people.  How is that a defense mechanism?  That's a hell of a...  To me, it's funny.  You gotta understand, these motherfuckers, I don't want to scare.  I don't do... 
[03:01:30]  He's a dick all the time.  That's the point.  That's exactly the point.  You're natural.  So I'm fucked.  Just don't shit in my own.  Because I want to do movies.  I want to do movies.  I want to do more work, but I'm essentially screwed as a person.  You should do a movie about your visit to that village.  I'd watch that.  Let me ask a question.  No, I think that'd be interesting.  How come I couldn't touch you?  Is that a personal...  No, you can touch me.  No, no, you can touch me.  I'll give you a hug and everything.  Oh, so you don't even know when Bobby's fucking around, really?  No, no.  None of us do.  All right.  Good enough.  I'm very confused by Bobby.  Watching these two talk, it was like every fucking grocery store in Brooklyn. 
[03:02:00]  Did I have one of those?  I think I knew one of those, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm cool now.  I'm fine.  I know what he's saying.  I know what he's saying now.  You know Danny?  What?  I love Danny.  You know Putty?  No, we have mutual friends.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, like my friend is dating one of the girls on Community, and we had...  We had chicken and waffles together.  Yeah, chicken and waffles together.  Nice.  Oh.  That sounds nice.  Great guy.  Great guy.  It wasn't just us two. 
[03:02:30]  You feel his energy, Danny's energy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the energy of going to work for the rest of his fucking life.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He just got...  It's very...  He has a lot to lose.  Thanks, guys.  You can feel it.  He's got the energy of, I got a lot to lose.  Yeah, he's going to need to be part of this.  Yeah.  It's just...  I don't need to be part of this.  Do you have any angst at all, Danny?  Is it...  What do you want to say when you just...  What do you go, oh, man, I wish I...  I just want to say this, and it ain't good to this business.  Well, he ain't going to say it.  To the business?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I played three Sanjay's in 2007, so there was definitely a little bit 
[03:03:00]  of that, where I'm Polish, too.  Everyone thinks I'm Indian.  As far as angst, besides that, that's really it.  You have my seat?  That's it.  Do you see how easy it fucking is?  He knows how to play it, yeah.  But if you ask me the same question, ask me now.  Do you have any...  I'm going to try...  What do you do?  I'm going to try to do what he does.  Why are you sitting like Truman Capote right now?  Because this is...  I want to change.  I want to change.  I want to change.  All right, ask him the question.  I want to change. 
[03:03:30]  Hey, let me ask you a question.  Yes, hello.  Is there anything about this business that causes you some angst that you just wish it wasn't  like this?  No, I love everybody.  No, I love everybody, and I'm just happy to be here.  Oh, yeah.  But they don't say that!  No.  No.  They don't say it that way either.  They don't say it that way.  Okay.  I'll be honest with you.  Okay.  Okay?  Do you love the business?  No.  And ask me why.  Ask me why.  Why don't you...  It's too late now.  It's already...  I'll tell you why.  Why don't you love the business?  Because it's the land of crazy. 
[03:04:00]  Nothing makes sense.  Okay?  Nothing makes sense.  All right?  If I...  I'll give you an example, right?  What I'm saying is this.  If an Asian guy like myself, right, who's on a series for eight years, who does stand-up,  you know what I mean?  Who sells...  You know, I'm not...  You sell a lot of tickets.  Yeah, but I sell tickets and stuff like that, right?  I shouldn't be able to...  I shouldn't be in a room with these 20, 20-year-old Asian guys, you know what I mean, waiting  to audition for something.  You know what I mean?  I should have had...  They should have called me in a separate time.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I wait an hour with these guys talking about...  I go, no, dude.  You can't kill the way I kill on stage. 
[03:04:30]  I mean, that's the truth.  You know what I mean?  And I feel like stand-ups...  Are you saying it could be racism in Hollywood?  Oh, shit.  Possibly.  No, what I'm saying is that I think that stand-ups in general don't get the respect that they deserve.  True that.  You know what I mean?  I think that, you know, if you go up on stage in front of 500 random people and you can crush,  I think that that should have...  You know, you come in at 2 to 2.30.  But Bobby, can I say that...  The regular people come at noon, you come at 2 to 2.30.  We don't give stand-up...  Now, that statement, though, we don't give stand-up the respect they deserve because as 
[03:05:00]  soon as we think we can leave, we go.  You leave.  Right.  No one stays.  Right.  So everyone wants to get...  Stand-up really is...  The stepping stone.  It's a stepping stone or a lower level.  We do that to ourselves.  Why?  I don't know.  That's what we do.  Meaning, every major comedian that used to start at stand-up that got up to a point where  he's recognized for not doing stand-up anymore, he doesn't do it.  Probably because of the money, though, too.  It's hard. 
[03:05:30]  You know, Jim Carrey can make a lot doing stand-up, but you get $20 million a movie.  And it's a lot easier as far as the grind or the risk of stand-up, which is bombing and  it's live and you've got to get...  It's acting...  Not that acting is easy, but it's less of a fucking grind to be on a film with nice people  who love you for $20 million.  But still, once you get your $20, this is what I'm saying, people quit.  That's what we do to our...  Yeah, Sandler doesn't do it much.  Murphy, Steve Martin, you're right.  Jim Carrey, a lot of those guys don't.  What you want to say?  They're all great comments.  I don't have to do this stupid shit no more. 
[03:06:00]  Why would they go out on the road?  Yeah, but Seinfeld does it, you know?  Yeah.  He's one of the...  Yeah, Cosby did it.  Cosby still does it.  I saw him recently in Atlantic City.  He's still doing stand-up.  Is he?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I mean, it's probably bad investment.  For me, stand-up is one of those things where it's like, I have to do it.  I'm addicted to it.  Yeah?  Yeah, I could be on a Monday night, and I'll go to an open mind.  I mean, they'll just put me on.  But I'll just try new stuff, you know what I mean?  I mean, it's just something that I have to do every night.  Really?  You're one of those guys.  Jimmy's like that, right?  Yeah.  I just love it. 
[03:06:30]  Even when I'm bombing, I just love it.  I don't like bombing.  Because my job as an entertainer, Bob, it's to really get those people feeling good.  And, Norton, if you hit it big where you're a 20 million movie guy, are you going to still do stand-up?  Yeah, I love doing stand-up.  Are you going to do spots on Thursday?  Chris Rock is a guy who makes a tremendous amount of money, films, everything, and still does it.  I would like to have that kind of a career where you're doing it because you have something to say and you want to do it.  Like, whenever he wants to go on, he goes on anywhere he wants. 
[03:07:00]  That's a great schedule.  And he's respectful with the time and everything.  Yeah, he's not a dick at all.  But he doesn't need to do it, but he loves doing it.  Like, that's the kind of career I'd like to have.  You would go fucking crazy because you'd be second-guessing up there, are they here and laughing because I'm funny?  Or are they here and laughing because I'm who I am?  No, but you get over that.  Like Seinfeld said, like the first five minutes.  I've seen Chris not have good sets or Jerry in the cellar, man.  The cellar's forgiving for five minutes.  Hey, we love you.  And they're not going to boo those guys, but they're not going to laugh for 40. 
[03:07:30]  Robin will go in there.  Robin Williams will do great for a few minutes.  And then he starts fucking working on material.  Eh, some works, some bombs.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's like any other comic after a few minutes.  Yeah, but that place is like an anomaly.  They're not going to yell at him.  That place is an anomaly.  But they're good.  That's why Chappelle works out there because they're very honest.  Yeah, but then you go into some regular fucking comedy club.  That's a comics comedy club.  I think the comedy store in L.A. is like that.  Yeah, he's right.  And it's very difficult.  Yeah.  That's why I like going to it.  I fucking, every time I have a TV set out there, I, when I do the store, oh, oh. 
[03:08:00]  Why, why?  It just is.  My first TV set ever was Louis Anderson's, my first real one was Frank.  That Louis Anderson show?  I did that in Santa Monica.  So the night before, I'm ready to tape, I go on, and fucking Dice walks in.  I'd never met Dice.  And they're like, Dice is going on.  So he goes, and nobody wants, Frankie Pace is on there.  She's like, I know he's got the fucking horn on.  I don't want to go on after Dice.  So I'm like, fuck it.  I'll go on after him.  I know I'm in a bomb.  And I had a TV, seven TV clean minutes. 
[03:08:30]  And he's like, the piano player brings you up.  I mean, the piano player tells the comedian on stage who you are, and they bring you up.  It's tag team.  And so Dice goes, oh, who's next?  Dice had just done an hour of filth.  And he goes, who's next?  And they're like, Jim Norton.  Who?  Oh, no, no.  This next guy, yeah, yeah, he's great.  You're going to love him.  I fucking died for seven minutes.  I tried the opening.  Like, I had Dice as my opener. 
[03:09:00]  Nothing.  I was like, 97.  Nothing.  There's nothing worse than bombing, but at the same time bombing, and you feel like you  bombed because they were above that stupid shit.  You said, really?  That was clever seven years ago.  You think we've never heard that faggot?  Yeah.  I bombed for beyond my control.  I couldn't have gotten out of it.  You don't do stand-up there?  I don't do stand-up.  Where you come from?  What's your background?  I did some sketch comedy and improv back in Chicago. 
[03:09:30]  Second City, right?  Theater.  Yeah, the Second City stuff.  I admire stand-ups.  I'm terrified of that.  I don't know if I could ever do that.  Yeah, that would be.  I don't understand how you get up there.  Especially bombing.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  No, I mean especially bombing.  It's just awesome.  When you get famous, though, and it comes down to it, you're going to do it.  Because a lot of comics, I notice the business right now is very strange, where everybody's  downsizing from movie star down to TV star and TV star down to commercial guy, commercial  guy, down to stand-up comedian, motherfucker. 
[03:10:00]  You can see it.  You can't just see it.  It's like fucking Christian Slater.  They've been trying to give him a TV show for, I think, three he's had.  But there's also a late 80s vibe where everyone's doing it now, like Roddy Roddy Piper's doing  it now at the comedy store every night.  Steve O's doing it now.  Yeah, Steve O's doing it?  Yeah.  Mick Foley's doing it.  Yeah, yeah.  So people are doing it now, you know what I mean?  Because they want to make the money on the road.  Damn.  You think it's all financial, huh? 
[03:10:30]  Well, I think they've secretly, like, what do you do to do it?  And that's why I work.  You think those guys think it's easy to?  Yeah.  Obviously, it's not.  I'm not trying to insult you guys.  But do they look at you guys and go, wow, that looks easy.  I could do that.  No, Roddy Roddy Piper has complete respect for us.  He even says, like, backstage, like, I can't do what you guys do.  And he goes up there and he struggles, but he's trying.  But you think they went into it ahead of time to, you think they did it, you know, thought 
[03:11:00]  that it was easy?  Maybe before they went into it.  That's what I'm saying.  You know what?  There's nothing scarier than the first time you go up, right?  And you're backstage and you're like, oh, my God, I have to actually do this.  And then you go up and the lights hit you.  And I've seen that.  You know what I mean?  Even with stars that have tried it for the first time.  Mary Lynn Ricegub did a show at the Laugh Factory.  She's on 24, Mary Lynn Ricegub.  And she asked all the cast of 24 to do stand-up for the first time, right?  So I get a call from Jamie.  I said, I go, you've got to get down here right away and close out the show.  I go, why?  Everyone's eating it. 
[03:11:30]  I went, pass room, the cast of 24, each, like the president, the FBI.  And they're up on stage doing stand-up, right?  There's a humility to stand-up, though.  See, that's the thing you understand.  There's a vulnerability even when you're trying to be.  And I can picture actors going up looking at what they think is funny when they look  at these fucking cheese balls with this new, the new, I don't care, I care, but if  y'all laugh.  Oh, that phony irony, that phony detached bullshit.  Phony irony.  Is that funny? 
[03:12:00]  You didn't get it?  So that, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,  But what I saw was fear on everyone's face.  They weren't even having that.  They were eating it.  I would've stood up, I would've gone stand-up basis for eating, ball-eating, like, good  for you.  That'd be a great episode of 24 right there.  Show it right in your fucking ass, cheese.  I would've loved that episode.  Now you know.  Now you know if I can cut and try it again.  Now you know how you have to cut and re-edit in your mind because you go,  fuck it.  And you do this in your mind. 
[03:12:30]  Motherfucker.  I missed the most important part of the fucking joke.  And that's in your head as you're sitting there trying to be like fucking finger gunpoint  like pain.  Going just how I planned.  A lot of crazy stuff going on.  Yeah, I just wanted to let y'all know that.  See, sometimes we comedians aren't trying to be funny.  We're just trying to be knowledgeable.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a, you know, it's easy.  But, but like I said, funny is a whole different thing from comedy. 
[03:13:00]  Comedy is business.  Yeah.  Just funny guys doing funny shit.  And then as many of those in the game as you think.  And the funny guys doing funny shit are the ones that have, some of them have problems.  Look at like Voss.  Voss is one of the funniest motherfuckers.  Can I tell you how funny fucking Voss was last night at that roast?  Voss is a sickeningly funny guy.  Yeah, yeah.  He's just one of the fun, I'm going to tell you the funniest thing Voss ever said.  And he said a thousand funny things, but he's so fucking good, right? 
[03:13:30]  This girl was in the audience just heckling or whatever.  He's like, all right, shut up.  So he goes, where are you from?  She says, Minnesota.  Where are you from, Minnesota?  And he says, I go to school.  Yeah, what do you do?  She goes, well, yeah, I go to school where you don't take classes and you kind of choose what  you want to do that day.  And Voss goes, who's your fucking principal?  Billy Jack?  My fucking head almost came off laughing that he would say that.  But Voss is like, there's nobody funnier than him. 
[03:14:00]  But that's not him being funny.  That's him being old.  And that's the last movie reference.  That fucker is so, he's a humble dude.  He's a funny guy.  But it's like, there's no way that you, that Big Lake should be on TV and Voss ain't on  TV.  You feel me?  It's just no fucking way.  And it's just, that's the thing about the game.  It's, it's, you know, you all shut the fuck up.  But it's, it's, I thought it was about talent. 
[03:14:30]  And I have, I have hammering at trying to, like, he's a driven guy.  He's not lazy.  No, no.  He's not a lazy guy.  He's been trying for years.  But he's uncomfortable.  Voss meets somebody.  He meets a new comic.  He is uncomfortable.  New comics don't fuck with each other.  I understand what you're saying, though.  We, we used to fuck with each other bad.  Me and Norton and them, we used to have hat court.  Where we would.  Oh, talk, take each other bits to hat court.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, exactly.  Hat court, yeah.  And we would put it, put your bit up for, on trial. 
[03:15:00]  Like, you know.  Oh, that's so cool.  I think that this bit sucks that you do.  Yeah, you have to defend your own bit.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Hack court.  You could never do that shit.  What was Patrice's?  I don't remember even what any of ours was.  No.  I would love to know.  I'll tell you what mine was.  I'll tell you right now.  Was it ass in the front?  I don't know.  Whatever it was.  Let's hear it, Patrice.  It was racist Popeye.  They put up.  They put that up.  I used to go.  Keith.  And I remember I put Keith's toe bulls up on trial. 
[03:15:30]  But I put up.  I used to go, ah, Popeye's a racist.  You can hear him.  He would go, ah, g-g-g-g-g-nigger.  And I fucking, after it went on hand court, I never said it again.  I couldn't defend.  You couldn't defend.  It just was funny.  It was funny to fucking hear.  Just to say that.  Yeah.  And oof.  Yeah, that was like the jury was out for six minutes on that one.  No questions for the judge.  He actually pled. 
[03:16:00]  He pled a fucking settlement.  They didn't even need to go in the back.  They just said, we're ready to vote right now.  No angry men on that one?  No.  Not at all.  We all got fucking killed in Hackport.  That's funny, man.  That's Hackport.  I was doing something on stage one time in the cellar.  It was something that required me, like, it was some horrendous movement.  And I look over and I see Keith and Voss looking at me from the door.  And I'm like, I never can do this bit again.  I was humiliated that I had been caught doing that bit. 
[03:16:30]  Like, looking up, jerking off, and your mom's at the door.  Yeah, but it was one of those fucking, one of those humiliating moments where you're just like,  the audience is okay for them to see it, but not your friends.  And that's why, you know, I distance myself, because a lot of comedy, you don't need to be funny.  And you meet a lot of taking themselves very seriously comics.  Where I go, what drove you to this again?  Because you joke.  Because Voss will go, I've seen people bent out of shape, but Voss will go,  how long have you been in the business?  Somebody will go, two years.  He'll go, okay, great. 
[03:17:00]  And he'll go, go give me a cup of coffee.  And he'll stay in the character.  Or me, I'll fuck with guys that go, hi, I'm such and such.  Like, and the guy that'll introduce is like, Bobby will introduce, Bobby Kelly.  He'll introduce like three young comics who love him.  And then they go, I'll introduce you to the guys.  And they come up with their, oh, we're going to meet Norton, produce.  And then I'll just go, Bobby, you should still be introducing yourself.  You get somebody else to introduce you to me. 
[03:17:30]  And then maybe I'll talk to your shitty friends.  And we won't break character.  But now it's like, this is just too mean.  They're horrified, yeah.  It's just evil.  I'm going to fucking kill myself if I'm being teased.  It's just like, ah, fuck out of here.  You ever see Keith?  Keith Robinson was really funny.  He'd be at the cellar and someone would go, hey, this is, I don't want to meet him.  And he won't look up.  And he gives the dismissive hand.  And he's a terrible actor, but he's great there because he will not look up and he won't meet him.  I don't want to meet him. 
[03:18:00]  Keith is brutal, man.  He's brutal.  I don't want to meet him.  I don't want to meet him, Philly motherfucker.  Oh, he really is a fucking dummy.  Or Voss.  Voss would go, the guy would stick his hand out to shake his hand.  Voss will tell somebody else, can you shake his hand for me?  I don't want to touch it.  It's just funny shit.  Voss will call anybody out.  Voss really does have a bit of Asperger's because he's the guy that will, I've watched  him do it in delis for years.  If they get him coffee and they touch the inside of his cup, in front of a line full 
[03:18:30]  of people, they'll go, you're touching the inside of my cup.  That's good.  Coughing your hand.  Watch your hand.  She's coughing your hand.  I forget who it was.  I was with a girl one time and I was waiting for her.  She went into the fucking store and she came out and she goes, some guy is being such an  asshole in there.  30 seconds later, Voss walked out.  God damn it.  He's the fucking worst.  And don't forget, you can't touch him either.  Can't touch Voss.  I think Voss had to be molested. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, he has that thing?  He gets freaked out.  I always talk about this.  I'll just wash my hand on him and he can't handle love or being hurt.  He loses his mind, yeah.  Wow.  Bobby Lee, though, he'll hump anybody, right, Bobby?  No, no, no.  Life lessons.  Life lessons.  Bobby Lee told me one time she was crying and Voss was trying to comfort her.  Was Danny plugging?  Yeah, I'm sorry, Danny.  It's a weird day, man.  We got a lot of guys in today.  What are you doing?  Community.  He's on Community on Thursday nights at 8 o'clock.  Get me sick.  It's only the biggest show on TV.  Isn't it a hit now?  It's a hit?  Nah, I wouldn't say it's a hit.  It's there. 
[03:19:30]  It's because...  They're picking it up.  They're picking it up.  Second season.  Who's your lead-in?  Us.  Are you at 8 o'clock?  Yeah, we're at 8 o'clock.  Yeah.  Last week we had Shrek as a lead-in.  That was nice.  This week, no lead-in.  That helps a little bit.  But we got Hilary Duff tomorrow.  Who's after your show?  Us, 30 Rock.  Oh, 30 Rock.  Then The Office.  So it's a whole block.  You're a part of the block.  Yeah, it's part of the block.  The must-see TV block.  Must-see TV.  Is that the biggest night on NBC right now?  I think so, right?  That's the only comedy night right now.  A lot of ethnic people go on their shows, which is great.  What?  On NBC, a lot of ethnic people.  Lots. 
[03:20:00]  Because of Grace Wu.  There's this Asian lady named Grace Wu.  A lot of Grace Wu.  Grace Wu.  But not a lot of black people, which, let's be honest, is the one that counts.  You had your...  No, we had two black people on our show.  Let me get two.  You had your own network.  Remember the CW and...  We had two on our show.  What?  Tracy and then the other guy that doesn't talk on The Office?  No, community.  No, we have two.  I mean, on 30 Rock, rather.  On 30 Rock.  On 30 Rock.  And Tracy's not black now, like, meaning Tracy is...  Tracy's a fucking brand now.  He's not, like, just a fucking black dude. 
[03:20:30]  Dot-com says stuff every once in a while.  But you have your own channel, right?  Tyler Perry, the whole thing?  Yeah, Tyler Perry.  I mean, it's like, what do you think about?  We don't have our own channel.  That's not my black people.  That's fucking...  That's churchy black.  That's not my churchy black.  This is my churchy woman.  When they have 3D, a hat comes out where you have to fucking get ties to the black church.  Give back your glasses, everybody.  Give back your glasses. 
[03:21:00]  Holy shit.  Who are your black people?  Who would you say you're black people?  Yeah, I don't know your black people.  God damn, man.  As a whole, I don't like positive black people, and I don't like fucking nigga shit.  I'm in between, so whatever that is...  Wow, what is that?  What is that?  That is right.  Jamie Foxx is a very...  In between?  A guy that's like...  He's worldly, he doesn't hide it, and he's not corny. 
[03:21:30]  I don't like black guys who go, well, I don't try my best to...  White people are watching.  And then I don't...  Like, niggas, I...  Nigga!  I eat scrimp!  And I was like, nigga...  Yes.  It's scrimp, nigga.  It's scrimp.  And fucking spell the T-H-E, nigga.  Stop putting D-A as the...  It's just like, it doesn't make you...  The shit.  So I'm...  Scrimp.  I'm stuck in between, man.  Like, I'm...  It's a weird thing, you know? 
[03:22:00]  Your audience is what?  Your audience is mixed, you're mostly white or half and half?  Oh, shit, man.  Mostly white people do.  It is?  Yeah, because I did a lot of white shit when I started, but I'm trying to get some black  people.  I got a real underground, good black following.  Yeah.  But they ain't coming out like this...  Like, they see Cat Williams, nigga, like...  They ain't like Patrice is in town, because I'm like, if those black people knew me when  I was in Minnesota, that's what would have filled up the other 200 seats that I was missing.  I'm the same way with Asians, right?  Like, the FOBs, fresh off the boats, they hate me.  Really? 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, and then the other ones that go to MIT, you know what I mean?  They hate me, right?  So there's a small group that likes me.  The ones who have fingered their asses of retards.  Anyone who's been raped by somebody who has an extra chromosome.  Like, do the fast and the furious ones like you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Tokyo Drift ones love me.  See, I'm learning something, because I would assume that every Asian comes out to see Bobby  Lee.  I would just assume that.  No, when I'm in Seattle, San Francisco, it's a great time, you know what I mean?  But it's like...  But Bobby doesn't...  He doesn't represent...  This one...  Russell!  I'm like, are you going to attack me again?  Oh, man, come on. 
[03:23:00]  Russell Peters?  Russell Peters somehow is the voice of Asians.  Yeah, yeah.  They go...  And when I say Asians, the whole...  Oh, the whole thing.  So they go, this is our guy.  And Aziz, that's our guy.  Yeah.  You know, Aziz's a little more mixed, but for them to come out, it's like this...  And that's who big comics are now, by the way, are the ones that just whoever they identify  with come to see them.  And that's why Larry the Cable guy, he's filling up 50,000 seaters with rednecks and shit. 
[03:23:30]  But see, I'll see...  I'll perform and I'll see an Asian person who thinks, you know what I mean, they're going  to like me.  And I can see in their eyes, like, this is not...  This is impossible.  This is not what I signed up for.  Yeah, this guy's not representing...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's not talking about...  You know what I mean?  You can see that in those tiny eyes.  Fucking Bobby Lee's going to be at Caroline's tonight.  I know that.  Yeah.  10 o'clock.  Well, you know what, guys?  Thank you so much for having me here. 
[03:24:00]  You want to run out of here before you...  I need a cigarette, first of all.  I need a cigarette.  Where are you going?  No smoke.  Oh, shit.  Daddy's got to go to.  I got to go meet some people.  Community.  Got to go meet my wife.  Yes, community.  Thursday nights.  Your wife.  Thursdays.  How long are you going to marry?  8 p.m. NBC.  That's right.  How long?  Five years?  Really?  When do you want me?  When you're six?  Seven?  Pretty much.  We've been in college.  We've been in college.  We will not.  Hey, Danny, I want to apologize because I think that vibe when you came in was a little weird.  And I think I'm the conduit.  You are the conduit.  Yeah, I'm the conduit of weirdness. 
[03:24:30]  So I just want to apologize because I love you.  You know what I mean?  And God bless you.  God bless you.  And I love how Bobby's facial hair looks like that magnet thing when he was a kid.  Magnet Google.  Bobby looks good.  It's like you can't hold back.  He has the same mustache.  I'm on it now with Bobby.  See you guys later.  Bye-bye.  Bye, Danny.  Nice meeting you.  Community.  What was that called?  Growing up there, Patrice.  Now I need to know what the fuck that was. 
[03:25:00]  I think he said Magnedoodle.  Okay.  Very good.  It was a bald-headed guy.  He just magnetized him.  That's hilarious.  I think Magnedoodle was something else.  It was like fucking Wooly Willie.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I think it was Wooly Willie.  And Patrice is...  I'm filming my special this Friday.  Friday night, two shows.  I'm going, Patrice.  I can't wait.  Where do people get tickets?  Is there a place you get tickets?  No.  I was giving away...  I gave away 60...  Wait, how many tickets?  50 or 60?  Those are pairs, so it's probably less.  50.  So I'll have more tickets to give away, either today or tomorrow. 
[03:25:30]  We're still giving tickets away.  Yeah, definitely.  For people in the New York area.  These are special MyStash tickets that I'm giving to the wonderful show here.  Patrice is really pumped, so...  In November 1920, I'll be at Poughkeepsie and Bananas Poughkeepsie.  I've been there in well over probably a year and a half, so I'm happy to be gone back there.  They'll have you upstairs.  They'll have you at the big house.  Downstairs.  That's what I do, yeah.  Well, fuck you.  Well, I do.  That's what I do.  Asshole.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:26:00]  When the fire is the Sirius XM. </pre>
