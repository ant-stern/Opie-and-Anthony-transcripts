<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of their radio ratings.  They were ranked fifth overall in New York City, but number one among male listeners, a fact that frustrated them given the dominance of hip-hop music stations in the overall rankings.  They brainstormed potentially controversial strategies to broaden their appeal, including targeting teenagers and residents of Section 8 housing.  Numerous callers, many using AAVE, offered suggestions, often involving hip-hop culture.  The hosts engaged in playful banter with the callers, frequently incorporating AAVE phrases and expressions.  The conversation was punctuated by advertisements, a story about Anthony's cigarette acquisition methods (only briefly mentioned), the retirement of a longtime engineer, and an intern's commentary on dating.  The language throughout this segment was extremely vulgar, featuring racial slurs and misogynistic remarks.

The show continued with a rambling discussion about hip-hop slang, particularly “shizzle,” involving attempts by hosts and callers to mimic and satirize this style of speech, often with comedic misinterpretations.  This segment included a lengthy, exaggerated account by Anthony of his unsuccessful late-night quest for "Darshan Classic Beaties" cigarettes, involving a train journey to Philadelphia and ultimately a fruitless trip to New York City and back.  Other topics briefly touched upon included listener complaints about the show's quality, the upcoming "WOW contest" and website issues, a new Sesame Street puppet with HIV/AIDS (including a performed parody song about AIDS), a listener's phone hang-up pranks, postponed calls about masturbation ("whacking it"), and a phone interview with Busta Rhymes promoting *Halloween: Resurrection*.  Busta Rhymes' appearance was marked by his apparent fatigue and lack of clarity.  Further advertisements were aired throughout.

The interview with Busta Rhymes continued, with the hosts and guests commenting on his low energy. They discussed the movie's plot, its poor handling of Jamie Lee Curtis's character, and its nonsensical ending, moving on to other bad horror movies, including the latest *Halloween* and a *Crocodile Hunter* movie. A caller, Rob, questioned whether Rhymes had a problem with the show.  The hosts and Norton discussed the interview's failure and their perceived poor performance. This segment also included Francine, a new intern whose angry and sarcastic commentary on news stories was featured prominently, with the hosts reacting to her fast delivery and unconventional takes on current events. Her commentary included remarks on political figures, celebrities, and news items.  The broadcast concluded with more commercial breaks.

A recurring “week in review” segment by Francine followed, covering a naked man at Wimbledon, a family feud over Ted Williams’ remains (including discussion of cryonics), an Allen Iverson legal dispute,  Michael Jackson's Harlem rally, allegations surrounding O.J. Simpson's sex tape, and Anna Nicole Smith's new reality show. Francine’s living situation, dating preferences, and views on celebrities and news stories were discussed with sexually explicit and offensive commentary from the hosts and Francine.  A graphic story from the Winnipeg Sun about a man having sex with dogs, resulting in the dogs' deaths, was discussed in detail, prompting further sexually explicit and offensive commentary. A new segment, "Let's Ask Francine," was announced, and the segment ended with further discussion of Francine and a reminder about a "Wow Contest."  Numerous commercial breaks were interspersed throughout.

The final segment began with a listener's "sick story" involving a kinky encounter, leading to a discussion about bestiality and sexually explicit jokes.  The conversation shifted to Francine, who apparently had a sex education role on Lifetime Television, and her upcoming appearance on the show. A caller shared an anecdote about aggressive sexual advances, resulting in further sexually explicit conversation.  Numerous advertisements were played, including those for mattresses, beer, vacation packages, automobiles, a lottery, a television show, hair growth treatment, and a vodka brand. Jay Moore, possibly a producer, called in to discuss a television segment featuring Opie as a WNBA stalker, airing the following Tuesday. The show concluded with the "What Did We Learn?" segment, where callers shared humorous and crude observations about the broadcast, incorporating several offensive racial slurs and homophobic remarks. This segment featured numerous offensive comments and sexually suggestive language.

Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  Hi, sweetie. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, you really read me the right, eh?  Glasses, half full, not empty.  You're a cut-up.  Ah, good gravy.  I agree with you, you agree with me.  This is so.  Tasteless, offensive.  The most uncomfortable radio I have ever heard.  Sucks on a daily basis.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Aren't we supposed to be trained to gain listeners' guidance?  No!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Boy, that really sucked 1940 humor. 
[00:02:30]  Lifetime.  Television for Women presents Portrait of an Intern.  Opie and Anthony intern Francine comments on the social complexities of meeting men in nightclubs.  Yeah, men are really stupid.  It's like you're on the dance floor at the club and you're dancing away.  This guy is really thinking he's going to take you home.  He's so stupid.  Oh, can I buy you a drink?  Sure, buy me a drink. 
[00:03:00]  Let me have four sex on the beach, please.  Yeah, he buys you all these drinks and then he expects you to dance with him all night.  No, I don't want to dance with you all night.  I already got my drink.  Get the hell away from me.  You're not taking me anywhere.  Yeah, you're grinding on me so damn hard.  I'm thinking you're penetrating my pants.  Freak.  Don't miss Francine tonight on Lifetime, television for women.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Nice head, dick. 
[00:03:30]  It's not about you, douchebag.  Who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  My bad.  Let me tell you something, my crunk-bick friend. 
[00:04:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oi.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027. 
[00:04:30]  Outside of New York City.  Yeah.  866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  You got to spin it around.  There you go.  And then tighten that.  It ain't working.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, it's kind of in an awkward place.  I think we need Pete, the engineer.  I'll fix it.  What happened to the microphone today?  I'll fix it.  This might work.  I don't know what happened. 
[00:05:00]  I'm ready for retirement.  He's been here 44 years, something like that.  And he's retiring.  He's got under a year left.  He's going to miss the guy.  He's going to miss us.  He's going to miss the guy.  He's going to miss us.  All right.  I hope he's one of those guys that has a nice retirement, though.  Some people get...  I'm sure they'll give him a gold watch or something.  Do you think they'll do that after 40-some-odd years of service here?  Yeah, he worked your whole life for a gold watch. 
[00:05:30]  I got my gold watch.  Now tomorrow I'll wake up and have nowhere to go and nothing to do.  What does he have planned?  I'd love to know.  I've got to sit and talk with him at some point.  He's going to travel the country.  Is that what he's doing?  Yeah.  Did he sock away some cash?  I know he's got a lot of the company stock, but the way the market's been going...  I might have to get a side job at the deli.  That's the saddest thing.  People retire.  They have money in the stock market.  The way it's going now?  He's taking a dump.  Oh, is he?  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  That's what he does these days.  Well, when you get older, you've got to take a lot more dumps.  Lots of dumps.  It's a good day if I move my bowels.  Eugene.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Eugene?  I want to congratulate you right in the post.  You guys are number five or four.  Tied for...  Between five and four, right?  Tied for fourth, I think, overall?  Yeah.  Congrats, guys.  Way to go.  You're the man.  But still number one in all the male demos.  Yes, yes.  I know that.  And that's the most important part.  It's hard to get that 12-plus number. 
[00:06:30]  Well, we made all the papers today.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  We talked about our successful spring book, Anthony.  What about...  The ratings came out, and we did very well.  Yeah.  Some of the highest numbers yet since moving back to New York City.  Yeah.  What about the little girls?  Did Norton help you out with that one?  The what?  What about the little girls?  Did Norton help with that demographic?  It looks like more girls are listening to the program.  Yeah.  More ladies.  Not a lot, but more are listening.  More lovely ladies.  Hey, I love you guys.  Thanks a lot.  All right, Eugene. 
[00:07:00]  I'm very popular with the ladies.  We really should explain that.  We explain this every three months.  Yeah.  Anthony and I were hired to just kick ass with the men out there.  The men.  And I don't know what our streak is out there, but we've been number one in all the male  demos for many, many books.  Mm-hmm.  I think at least two, two and a half years straight.  Okay.  But there's another number, the overall number.  Last book, we were in 10th place overall.  That means everybody listening to the radio.  All the little teen girls, all the old men, old ladies, and everyone in between. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  It's people 12 years old and older.  That's who they survey.  Now, it's our ultimate goal to be number one in Afternoon Drive, 12 plus.  Right.  That means with everybody listening to the radio.  We've already accomplished that feat in the good city of Cleveland, Ohio.  In...  But we haven't done it here in our hometown of New York City.  The closest we've come is fifth place, and I believe we're in fifth place again.  And everyone in front of us is music. 
[00:08:00]  Well, they're all hip-hop stations.  Yeah.  And the Light FM station.  Light FM.  But as far as personality radio, no one is close to us.  We kicked Sean Hannity's ass.  Mike and the Mad Dog, at this point, they're a joke in New York City.  Yeah.  They had the nerve to make fun of our TV skills.  Well, they certainly had every right to.  Well, then we have every right to make sure people know that their show absolutely blows.  What happened, Mike?  We have pretty much twice the audience of those guys in Afternoon Drive.  And before we came back to New York City, they were, if I could use the word king, they 
[00:08:30]  were the kings of Afternoon Radio, Anthony.  Not no more.  They're not even close.  Maybe we ought to put together a wild contest, then, Mike.  Not even close.  So we sit in fifth place.  I think tied for fifth or tied for fourth.  Yeah.  You got it right in front of you.  What are we?  I do.  We got the Light FM station beating us.  It's pretty much elevator music and a bunch of hip-hop stations.  Yeah.  A bunch of criminals, Opie. 
[00:09:00]  Because I like to call them the criminal stations.  But there's a...  That's a lot of tease.  Okay.  Jesus.  Don't worry about it.  They're not listening to us.  I know.  But what separates us between fifth place and second place is point two.  Yeah.  Point two.  It was a dog race this time around, right?  Here it is.  All right.  Light FM and Afternoons, Opie, is first.  Yeah.  Okay.  You got like that big 6.7.  Well, it's a very safe radio. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  For the work environment, Anthony.  Then there's...  You can't have girls moaning as you're trying to get business done.  QHT.  That's a hot 97.  And I guess they're tied with Z100.  Who's that?  HTZ?  HTZ is Z100.  Yeah.  I don't even know who's on Z100 opposite us.  I know.  I don't know who's on opposite us on Hot 97.  And I have no clue who does the afternoon drive show at Light FM. 
[00:10:00]  And then there's power.  You think they're all getting pats on their back?  Of course.  Why?  They had nothing to do with it.  They're just running the jukebox.  You think the jock in afternoons at Light FM is like, yeah, I did it again.  I did it again.  You did nothing.  You pushed buttons.  You run a jukebox.  You could put a monkey in there and then it would be fine.  They'd still get that number one rating.  But, yeah.  And then we come in there.  And we are just a .2.  A .2 rating away from second place. 
[00:10:30]  That was close.  God damn it.  What position are we in, though?  Fifth?  Well, there's a tie in there.  So, yeah, we're fifth.  Tied for fifth?  No, we have fifth.  Somebody's tied.  Yeah, QHT and Z100 are tied for second.  There you go.  It's a real dog race.  But we're number one in all the mail demos.  Woof, woof.  By far.  We got like twice the audience in all the mail demos.  But it's frustrating to us because this is all the papers write about is the overall ratings. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  The reality is our bosses, the ad community, none of those people care less about the 12-plus numbers.  But we do because it's like bragging rights, you know?  It would be nice.  But it's a tough nut to crack when a show like this would have to get listeners that are, you know, the teen girls listen to the Z100.  Well, we try to do teen parties and stuff, but management shut us down.  Somehow it's different.  We want to do teen pool parties and teen pajama parties and teen sleepovers. 
[00:11:30]  They don't like the way it sounds.  Why don't we have a sub-20 party?  Ooh.  Why don't we just call it a sub-20 party?  Because for some reason the word teen upsets other people.  They get a little nervous in the office when they hear us say teen for any reason.  You know what I really want to do?  Is a pool party.  Have a pool party?  Just have someone invite us to their pool.  It doesn't have to be big.  And do the whole show for their...  No, it doesn't have to be big.  I want to go to one of those city pools and do some wilding. 
[00:12:00]  So, anyway, there's something to shoot for.  Yeah.  To try to get that number one overall.  We're working on it.  We're working on it.  Bye-bye.  We're in fifth position, two-tenths away from second place.  Right.  As we move forward from here.  And then we have news from other cities coming up later in the week.  I think Chicago's tomorrow and Philly and Boston and Washington all around the corner.  Cleveland right around the corner.  Looking forward to all those. 
[00:12:30]  Thank you, New York.  Yeah, thanks again.  Nice.  We did quite well.  Ron and Fez did quite well here in New York City.  The whole station went up.  You know, but we needed mornings and middays to go up a lot more.  So, we're still working on those two shows.  Where are all those people on various radio message boards that were spelling our demise?  What happened?  Why don't they, like, post some posts about this book? 
[00:13:00]  Bunch of hypocrites.  Jackasses.  How long do you have to be on the air before you're not a fad anymore?  You know, the flavor of the month, as some people like to say.  We're up to four years.  Is that it?  Does it get to the point after a while people realize, you know, maybe you'll be around for a little while.  A little while longer.  Well, you're still doing well.  These ratings guarantee we'll be around for another six months.  There you go. 
[00:13:30]  Six months.  That's how the radio guys live.  That's how they work.  You get a good ratings book.  You're guaranteed to last six more months.  Other people.  After that, you don't know.  You have a couple bad books in a row.  I mean, they're already looking for your replacement.  That's the reality of it.  We know it.  It'll happen someday.  There are some people in New York that didn't look very promising.  You know what I mean?  A couple of stations.  A couple of people that, you know, a couple of shows, as a matter of fact.  Some of which aren't in New York anymore. 
[00:14:00]  But other ones that are in New York still that, I don't know, didn't seem to be working out.  Name names.  Oh, the radio chick.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It was like, uh-oh.  She used to work here.  Yeah, used to work here.  And it kind of went over to the Classic Rock station.  And nothing's going on over there?  Yeah.  It doesn't seem the numbers aren't moving anywhere.  That's too bad.  And I'd hate to think, you know, maybe the company would look and go, why are we paying  so many people when we could just pay the one guy?  And he was getting the same numbers. 
[00:14:30]  He was getting better numbers by himself.  There you go.  All right.  A little ratings chat for you.  So thank you, New York City.  Thank you.  Hey, Mark.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You said to remind you about what Anthony did to get a pack of cigarettes yesterday.  And I'm dying here.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get right into that right now, okay?  Good stuff.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Hey, you guys suck.  No, and I love you.  Thanks, and I love you. 
[00:15:00]  Mark, but we all do the show together.  And, you know, if you can't talk one guy up, you're going to upset the rest.  One for all and all for one.  Can we share the love today, please?  I'm starting to feel it.  Share the love.  My shallow ego can't take this.  Can you feel my loving?  Just three men standing in a circle, helping each other with hands and wrist action.  Why not?  Yeah, it's a love fest today.  So no goddamn music discussions.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  It's a love fest.  Why?  Everything's good?  Everything is good.  Of course it is.  All right.  The cigarette story, Anthony.  Yeah, well, I'm kind of a spontaneous guy.  Well, can I?  I think I am.  I'll start by saying this.  We were at OzFest on Friday.  Everyone knows that.  We broadcast a lot.  We had a lot of fun, thanks to the gang down there in Philly.  And everyone knew that we had to be on a plane first thing in the morning to fly up to Buffalo  for the T&A with O&A party that, by now you have found out, was Off the Hook Yo. 
[00:16:00]  Off the Hook Yo.  Are you trying to get some of the numbers that those other stations are getting, Opie?  I figure we should throw in a little hip-hop stuff.  Off the Hook Yo is going to get to compete with the hip-hop stations.  All right.  Maybe we can get some numbers like this.  Yeah, boy, I'm hearing that.  Some of these hip-hop stations in New York, and I know you have them in your city that you're  listening to us on, they talk and you have no clue what they're saying. 
[00:16:30]  I have no idea.  I am so out of that culture.  Wow.  I'll be listening and go, what did they just say?  I have no idea what they just said.  Are they planning a riot?  I have no idea.  And then it's cool because every year or so, at least every year or so, sometimes more  than a year or so, out in front of these studios, there's shootings, which is really hysterical.  Yeah, boys.  Yeah, we off the hook, yo, here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:17:00]  Is that Lil' Kim outside?  Let me file up some shots at her hand.  Yeah.  That's right.  You're listening on the heavy end of time, the votes you make back, isn't it?  Yeah, please.  Yeah.  Wow, look, we're going up already.  We'll have second place in no time. 
[00:17:30]  Now I'm one, one.  What?  Ain't that summer?  Remind me of a strip club.  Yo, Puffy, give this to Anderson, man.  Give it a hand.  It's over.  No, don't shoot it off.  Yeah, man.  Whoa.  It's not him, I said.  Yeah.  We all thought you loved yourself.  We're getting jiggy with it.  Oh, man.  Yo, Busta!  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Instead of doing shout-outs, we'll do shoot-outs.  Shoot-outs.  That's it.  Here's a shoot-out to Jason Williams.  Yo, kid.  Let's hang in there.  Everything's got me, all right?  Yeah.  Yo, pass the bottle of Chrissy.  Yeah.  I spent 15 grand a night on Chrissy.  That's long enough to be for me.  You.  So whatever it is, you want to get you.  That's the Kavarsie. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  That's right.  That's right.  Get up for real, just like a man in there.  Who get it all, you spend for the hands with them.  Man, y'all gon' make me lose my mouth.  Woo!  Yeah.

I'm listening to you.  What?  What?  Little Nelly action, right?  Yeah, man.  Listen, this is the first time I ever got through in like a year.  Yeah, because we just scared all the white people away.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No.  So what's up, bro?  Just chilling, just hanging, man.  Enjoying your show.

Find yourself buried next to someone else.  And we all thought you loved yourself.  But that couldn't have been the issue.  Oh, maybe they just saying that. 
[00:22:00]  Now, of course, they miss you.  S***, a n***a tried to miss you.  That's why you're laying on your back, looking at the roof of the church.  Preacher telling the truth.  And you know that it hurts.  S***, a n***a tried to miss you.  S***, a n***a tried to miss you.  S***, a n***a tried to miss you.  Where you're doing?

[01:26:30]  Alright man  Thank you  Godspeed  Friday last day to  Qualify for the wow  Contest  Want to keep saying  That  So they get a  Chance at the  Five thousand dollars  Courtesy of  Riskayvideo.com  Right  Alright  You want to tell  The cigarette story  We all thought  It was  We all thought  It was kind of  Strange  Thought it was a  Little weird  Yeah  But I'm  I knew you were  Up to something  When I got to  The airport  And you were  Already there 
[01:27:00]  Yeah  Yeah I was there  Since four  Four in the morning  About four thirty  In the morning  I had already been  To the  The Philly airport  Alright so  Why don't you  Walk us through it  After the Ozfest  Broadcast  Down there in Philly  Yeah  We all checked  Out Ozzy  And that  And then we went  Back to the hotels  Back to the hotels  And I noticed  We were running out  Of these  Classic Beaties 
[01:27:30]  Darshan  Classic Beaties  Chocolate flavored  Filter  Cigarette things  Who the hell  Smokes those  Besides you guys  They're made in India  It smells like  You're setting  The woods on fire  Every time you  Light one of those  Things up  It smells like  Leaves  Burning leaves  Right  Were you the  Beatles in 1970  These aromatic  Beaties are blended  With these  Specially flavored  Aged Indian  Tobacco  Hand wrapped  In an Indian  Ebony leaf 
[01:28:00]  Enjoy India's  Ancient pleasure  Underage sale  Prohibited  And yeah  It's one  Specific brand  They're called  Darshan  But what's in them  It's tobaccy  Weird  It's tobacco  But it's rolled  It looks just  Like a joint  As a matter of  Fact  When we were  In Buffalo  At the TNA  With ONA  Everyone thought  I was smoking pot  And I wasn't  Sharing with everybody  They're like  Dude dude  Come here 
[01:28:30]  Give me one  I was like  No it's  It's a cigarette  Yeah sure  Okay  Because they look  Look see  It's a leaf  And it's round  And it's got a little  String here  Tying where they  Tie the end of it  And it's  And they come in  Various flavors  Mint  Very good  Chocolate's good  The cherry  Is really good  And  I have had  Nothing but  Problems finding  These  They're very  Hard to find  I live in  Brooklyn  There's plenty  Of smoke shops 
[01:29:00]  Plenty of  Injins  In Brooklyn  And I couldn't  Find them  All over  Manhattan  I went to  A lot of  How many smoke  Shops are in  Manhattan  Six  At least six  I'd say  Seven  There are  I'd say seven  There are  Probably  Thousands  Of smoke shops  In the biggest  Manyest nine  City in the world  In New York City  And there's one place  Now you're not a heavy smoker  No  I think this is like  Kind of  These are kind of cool 
[01:29:30]  For now  I'm into it  It's a goofy little habit  You got going  I'm into them for now  They taste really good  It's not like just a regular cigarette  Important to the story  I understand  There's a lot of people out there  That'll do a lot of things  To get their nicotine fix  Right  You're not one of those people  Really  You've just got a goofy  Little habit  I'm enjoying these right now  That's all it is though  They're  You know  Kind of cool  Okay  And no  It's not one step away  From being a terrorist  Balloon not Joe  I enjoy the cigarettes  They're from India  So 
[01:30:00]  There was one place  It's right there on  55th and 7th Avenue  In Manhattan  That has these  So  The problem is  We're in  Philly  Yeah  Yeah  We were in Philly  At the time  And it's late  And me and my girlfriend  Had run out  Of these  Darshan  Classic  Beattie  Filter cigarettes  It was about  11 o'clock  Or so  At night  And  I suggested  Why don't we go back  To New York City 
[01:30:30]  Go to the smoke shop  On 55th and 7th  And pick up  A couple of packs  For our trip to Buffalo  For the trip to Buffalo  Because call me silly  I don't think I'd have  Found these in Buffalo  But it looks like  It would have been  Alright without them  Yeah but  With the situation  Of the  TNA with ONA  And the drinking  Because  If I'm pounding  Some drinks down  These things are  A fixture in my hand  You know what I mean  So  We went to the 
[01:31:00]  Train station  And  Knowing the whole time  You gotta get on  The first flight  Out of Philly  To Buffalo  Our flight  Was at 930  Out of Philly  To Buffalo  And  Yeah  There's no sleep  Going on  We had done  The Oz Fest  And we were  Pretty beat  But  We tried to get  The sleeper car  From Philly  To New York  The hour  Trip  Or hour and a half  That it is  But they were all  Booked up  Because that could  Have been fun  You have a little  Story about some  Fun on the train  On your way  To city to city  Well you're obviously 
[01:31:30]  Not the only people  That needed cigarettes  At that hour  Maybe  That was a whole  Train full of people  So we took the train  To New York  Philly to New York  Now the train  Leaving Philly  To New York  Was delayed 20 minutes  Which really  Almost screwed up  The time frame  Because we had to  Take a cab then  From Penn Station  To the smoke shop  We got back  With about  Five minutes to spare  To jump on the train  Back to Philly  Or else I think  I would have had a problem  Getting to Buffalo 
[01:32:00]  How many passengers  And how would I have  Explained how I was  Not making it  In time to Buffalo  Because I had to go  Back to Manhattan  For cigarettes  But I bought  Four packs  So he pretty much  Traveled all night long  To get cigarettes  For his trip to Buffalo  And then you get back  To get what amounted  To probably  Four packs  Of $300 cigarettes  That's not even  That many packs  You could have run out  In two days  For four packs  No  We don't like 
[01:32:30]  Smoke that many  Of them  And what was  The train ride  Was what  An hour and a half  Hour and a half  Each way  Each way  With a little stop  And you were in New York  For a total of 15 minutes  Yeah about 15 minutes  So then  When we get back  When we get back  To Philly  I had another brainstorm  And said look  It's now  We got back  It had to be  About  About four in the morning  And I said look  If we go back 
[01:33:00]  To the hotel  And try to sleep  And then get up  And go to the airport  Ain't gonna happen  It's gonna be a mess  The packing  And everything  Why don't we just  Go back to the room  Pack up  And go to the airport  And sleep there  Oh man  So I packed up  We left the hotel  At about 4.30  And within 15 minutes  We were at Philly  International Airport  Over there  The airport in Philly  And slept on the  Metal hand arm rest 
[01:33:30]  In the chairs  For three hours  Until you guys came  Rolling up  Looking all fresh  And ready to go  Ready to roll  And then  And then when we got  To Buffalo  There was no time  To sleep there either  So during the TNA  With ONA  I was hallucinating  I was so tired  I hadn't had  Any sleep  Since  I guess we got  To Oz  Before that  Oh that's a nice

What are you doing then?  Looking good  Looking good  So who are you in that?

You put a bunch of people  In the house, right?  And it's like a  Real world type look  Like a live camera  Web feed thing  And then  And then Michael  Like a spin-off  Of a real TV  Kind of a vibe  Right  So what happens?  Like how does Michael Myers  Come back?  I thought he was chopped up  Last time or something  I thought he was too  But you know  They explain it fully 
[01:49:30]  For you in the movie  That's why I don't  Want to give it away  All right  People are going up there  And see it  All right  Well, what part  Do you play there, Buster?  I play a cool cat  In that movie, man  A cool cat  A cool cat  What do you like?  You're involved  With the TV show?  I'm a young guy  I'm a slick talker  I'm an entrepreneur  Trying to get this  Real TV business  And idea of mine  Off the ground  And I put this contest  Together to launch  The campaign  And this TV show  I'm trying to get going  And you know 
[01:50:00]  Six kids will be chosen  To go into the home  Of Michael Myers  Which is where  The actual  The actual live broadcast  Of daydertainment  Will be taking place  And then lo and behold  He comes back  Yeah, once they get  In the house  And the doors close  And the windows  Are locked shut  Behind him  That's when  The hell breaks loose  Do you get a chance  You don't have to  Give anything away  But does Buster  Get a chance  To kick a little ass  On him?  Yeah, we have  Some real interesting  Encounters in the film  Me and Michael Myers  Yeah?  Yeah  That I want to see  I want to see Buster 
[01:50:30]  Maybe beating  Mike Myers over the head  I do believe  This is going to be  The worst Halloween movie  Of them all  Who said that?  You think so?  Who said that?  You think so?  No, I don't  I thought it looked good  And it's got  Jamie Lee Curtis  Back in it, right?  Oh, most definitely  Yeah  Jamie Lee, Tyra Banks  Sean Patrick Thomas  Tyra Banks  Nice  Yeah, a lot of people  Definitely doing it  Did they put makeup  On Jamie Lee Curtis  Because she didn't look good  In the commercials?  Yeah, they put  That's the makeup work 
[01:51:00]  That she had  That's the look  She had to have  Oh, good  Because I  No, I didn't know that  I just tuned in  And was like, uh-oh  Jamie Lee  You know Jamie Lee Curtis  Is sexy  I know, but I haven't seen her  You've seen her in True Lives  You've seen her in True Lives  You know she hot to death  She looks hot  In those phone commercials  She does  I understand  I just thought maybe  Something happened  And she hit the wall  You know how  The bitches can do that  Sometimes, Buster  They hit the wall  And you saw them  Just last week  And then all of a sudden  You're like, what happened?  I thought that only happens  After you put a good  Rearing out on their ass  In the bed or something 
[01:51:30]  That can happen, too  Yeah  Then you've got to move on  Yeah  Is Donald Pleasance  In this one, too?  Donald Pleasance is dead  You idiot  Is really?  Yeah, he died  I didn't know that  I didn't know that  Hey, Buster  We met you at the VMAs  And actually, our own Ben here  Introduced you to Fatboy Slim  Oh, yeah  You remember that?  Oh, yeah  Anything going on with you  And Fatboy?  Nah, I ain't seen Fatboy  Since y'all introduced me to him  Yeah, it was getting 
[01:52:00]  Real cloudy down there  And we decided to introduce you  To Fatboy  I never saw so much pot  Being smoked  In that bar area  Yeah, I know, man  That was because of y'all  Y'all brought the bongs out  And all of that, man  You know, I was trying to get at y'all  But, you know, it didn't really get worked out  Yeah  Yeah, white boys smoked their pot out of the bongs  You guys used those big, huge blunts  Yeah  You got the  Well, y'all dudes invented the bong, right?  Well, we invented it  I don't see many brothers using the bongs to get high  They get those blunts working 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, yeah  That's usually what the brothers do  Yeah, the brothers do  Jesus Christ  Well, Buster  Anything else you want to tell us about the movie?  It's the hottest movie of the summer  As far as horror flicks is concerned  Yeah, it's the only horror flicks  You definitely need to go to the movie theater  Yeah  You want to see that?  The movie is definitely well-rounded  Well-written and full of action, drama, and comedy  And it's definitely going to be hot  When does it premiere, Mr. Rimes?  It's already in theaters  It's already in theaters?  Okay  Norton, you have gotten everything wrong 
[01:53:00]  Dude, I don't know  I mean  Are you working with Ozzy?  No  Is Donald Pleasence in it?  No  When does it release?  It's released already  All right, I'm trying to give a release date  I didn't know  I'm very out of the loop with everything  You know that  I apologize  Yes  Hey, Buster  Are you the first guy killed in the movie?  Nah, but you know  They tried to have it like that  Well, they always off the black guy first  Yeah, man  You know  You have to change those rules just a little bit  I understand  I'm just stating the obvious 
[01:53:30]  Yeah  All right, Buster  You guys take it easy, man  Thank you, Buster  Oh, but something tells me  If he was on a hip-hop station  He'd have sounded a lot, like, more energetic  And a lot more fun  And happy to be here  I was thinking  After the first two breaks we did today  I was thinking we were kind of in it  We were doing good  And the Buster Rhymes  And if you would have really pulled it all together  And just boosted us right to second place 
[01:54:00]  That was awful  That's all right  When this happens  Jeez  Like, Buster Rhymes  Hey, everybody  Hey, what's up?  Yeah  Yep  No, not that, Buster  What's up, yeah  I want the energetic Buster  Oh  Should have done a four minus three with him  Yeah, see  Maybe we didn't know the lingo  Should have done a four minus three early  With Buster  He sounded like when he said brother  He was like, yeah, the brother 
[01:54:30]  He was like, uh-oh  He'll be starting racial problems  Well, he used to call in the hip-hop stations  And then he calls here  And it's like, hi, how are you?  Yeah  Welcome to the show  No, I was like  I was  I said, was poppin'  Yeah, it was awful  I said, was poppin'  And he didn't give me back the little code word that you give back  Because you probably couldn't see the face  Him looking just like  Not even with the phone to his ear  He's staring at it  Straight in front of him 
[01:55:00]  Just going  We're kicking his publicist in the leg  Was poppin'  And let's stop making the Halloween movies  Stop  You don't like it?  It's over, Johnny  Look at the, uh, Jason  You know, Friday the 13th movies  Stop making those two  Jason in space?  Stop  Are you kidding?  No, they didn't  No, they didn't  That was the last one  Hey, Gary, what's going on?  Horrid, man  I wanted to get on and ask him  I've seen every, um, single Halloween  Yeah  Hands down, this was the worst ever made  What made it so bad?  Well, not to take 
[01:55:30]  Not to try to ruin it from anyone  Oh, because we're all going to run out and see it  Yeah, but the movie starts off with him finally getting and killing Jamie Lee Curtis  Yeah  Which basically ends Michael Myers' reason for living  Oh, wait a minute  The beginning  I thought she was in the end of the movie  Nope, it's the beginning  Ah  So there's no reason for him to have to go on and kill  Oh, so, uh, he kills Jamie Lee Curtis to start the movie?  Exactly  So is there flashbacks after that?  No, what happens is  So Jamie Lee Curtis is only in this movie for five minutes?  Five, ten minutes  Oh, but get this  Kind of like the Drew Barrymore thing? 
[01:56:00]  She's in a, um, she's in a mental hospital  Gary  Yeah  Hold on two seconds  I'll explain what happened because Big Kev told me this  He knows everything about all these movies  He said that, uh, they shot the movie  And no Jamie Lee Curtis or nothing  They shot the whole movie, finished it, tested it  Right  And the audiences were just like  This blows, this sucks, we don't like it  So they went back  Got Jamie Lee Curtis  Five minutes to do, like, a scene  Exactly  I guess this was the beginning of the movie now  Where she gets killed 
[01:56:30]  Right, which  And then they released it that way  Yeah, and, you know, if you follow the storyline  You know, you know, his sole purpose is to find her and kill her  Right  So you start a movie with that  And it's like, oh, okay  There's no reason for the movie to go on  What number is this in the Halloween series?  Five  Oh, five, wow  Five or six, I'm sorry, six, I think  So, six?  Yeah  So Jamie Lee Curtis was dead for most of the movie  Exactly  Yeah  Most of the movie  It was horrible  Was it?  When did Buster get killed?  Unfortunately, he doesn't 
[01:57:00]  Oh, he lives through the whole thing?  Yeah  Was he good?  Could he act?  No  Who kills him?  He does  Wait a minute, Buster kills him?  Yeah, he ends up electrocuting him  Oh, not the old electrocution gag  Did it happen like you see the wire jumping on the ground or something?  Oh, yeah, the wire  And he got caught up in cable TV wires and all this stuff  And he gets fried  Can we chop him up into tiny little pieces so he doesn't come back ever?  How did he come back?  Well, at the end they do an autopsy on him 
[01:57:30]  And then his eyes open up and that's how it ends  Oh, Jesus  Jimmy, I'm afraid  Stop  That sucks  Awful  Well, sir, did they show any of the autopsy or did they just start it?  No, they didn't show the autopsy  I'm Voss  I'm sorry  It's Voss  All right  An autopsy  They found a tortilla  Lean cuisine  He was eating lean cuisine  All right, now I have to abuse you at Westbury Music Fair  Oops, sorry, a little pop there  Oh, okay, who cares about September 7th?  That's what we're talking about today 
[01:58:00]  So Busta Rhymes kills him  Yes  Jamie Lee Kerr is dead for just about the whole movie  Exactly  And he opens his eyes up at the end  So there's going to be another one  How does he kill him?  Does he bore him to death on the phone?  Oh, he attempts to speak English to me  It doesn't work  All right, thank you, bro  Oh, there you go  Aw  Hey, Lou, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  That movie was horrible  Ooh?  Yeah  Oh, it was horrible  You know what was worse?  Really?  The Crocodile Hunter one was worse  Oh, you saw that one? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, that was even worse  He's like, all I know of this movie is the Crocodile Hunter from TV and his wife are trying to relocate a crocodile  But the crocodile ate some kind of a space probe thing  So the poachers are trying to get the crocodile  And the, like, space agency or whatever is trying to get their probe back  So, it's like a bad Gilligan's Island episode, isn't it?  Thanks, Gilligan's Island was better  What?  Gilligan's Island was better  So, how soon into the movie does the Crocodile Hunter get killed? 
[01:59:00]  He should have been killed in the very beginning  But he lived  You know, the Siskel and Ebert team there, they gave it two thumbs up  Yeah, what's up with that?  Or is it Roperd and Ebert or...  I still call it Siskel and Ebert  It's just Siskel and Ebert  I'm not going to accept anybody else  All right  I don't care, the guy's head rotted away on his body  I think it was because the popcorn was good  Old pudding brain in Ebert  Thank you, Will  Hey, no problem, guys  Bye  Ant, when you smoke the little chocolate 
[01:59:30]  He put D-word, cigarettes  Do you use the wood-tipped holder like in Mommy Dearest?  I love this night!  William, you smoke like Clay Shaw  Rob, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Look, I don't have much to say about the whole movie part of it, you know  But, I mean, look, I've heard Busta in a lot of interviews  And, you know, the energy, like you said, was really down  And I don't know, I was really excited to hear him on your show  You know, my favorite show and all  But I'm just wondering, like, honest to God  Do you think that there's a reason, like, he's got something with you guys or something like that? 
[02:00:00]  I don't know  I hope not  He started it with low energy before we even started getting it  Yeah  He's doing phone interviews all day  And when you're calling all these stations  He's in L.A.  He's probably got a call here and Ohio and Texas  No, Rob brings up a good point  What?  He does  I was kind of feeling something weird there  Definitely  Like he was like, yeah, you guys  Uh-huh  Yeah  He was quick to hang up, too  In a way, I mean  Hey, Rick, why don't you call him back?  No, but even Norton 
[02:00:30]  Yes, sir  I knew that was coming  Oh!  Wow  I don't know, man  Oh, yes, sir  I knew that was coming  No, I don't know  I will always admit if I'm God  He got me, but I knew it was coming  I'm not going to lie  I never lie about getting God  If you get me, well, I'll take my hat off to you  Even though I'm not wearing one  It is the eighth Halloween installment  Oh, my God  Eight  Maybe he was very low-key  Because he knows the movie stinks  And they're forcing him to promote it  I really don't think I was going to do it this show  Because you're doing interviews all day  The way they kill these things are like 
[02:01:00]  Enough for it  How many times has that electrocution thing been done  In Bond movies  Jaws 2  Jaws 2  Whenever they  They'll be in a basement  And there's a fight scene  And for some reason  There's that big steel grate  And steel fencing  With all the electric equipment behind it  And you just know  All right, he's going to hit that  Someone's going to throw the switch  Or put the wire against the cage  Oh, enough  How many times?  The Jaws 2 
[02:01:30]  When Richard Harris was chasing him  Through the whole film  Richard Harris  All right, we're going to regroup, Ant  After our Buster interview  Oh, yeah  We're going to do the Francine thing  When we get back, okay?  I want to hear my Francine jingle  She's a dips and a dope and a moron  She never learned to add two and two

[02:16:30]  Francine  Francine  Francine  Francine  Francine  Ah  The angry intern  Yeah she seems like angry at everything  Yeah this all started  She went into the studio and um  She riffed  And she riffed for like 30 some odd minutes  Yeah  And gave the CD to Jim Norton  And Jim Norton presented it to the program  And we got some good stuff out of it last week didn't we?  Yeah  She seems to be very angry  And she's got a  Her  Her own unique outlook on life  A quick wit  And a brand of humor 
[02:17:00]  That's uh  So we figured we would  Take it to the next level  And  And ask uh  Francine to kind of riff on the news a little bit  Yeah  See what her take on uh  Current events are  And she wants to talk uh  About Gary Can Do It  She calls him Gary Conduit  Conduit  Conduit  Because um  You're supposed to sound out every letter  Exactly as it appears on the page  But it's not like that  It's just Gary Conduit  C-O-N-D-U-I-T  Conduit  Appears to be Conduit  Did she run away? 
[02:17:30]  I don't know  We can't find her  Well she's look  Anywhere there's work going on  Look somewhere else  Oh Jesus  I saw her panicking a little bit  Did she run away on us?  I don't know  No she didn't  Come on  She's still crying on radio  Where'd she go?  That would be really funny  She's always right there  She's not going away  She's probably taking a nervous dump  Looks like someone's throwing stew in the toilet  The whole  The system is all messed up inside  Yeah  The fear 
[02:18:00]  Uh oh  Ben's coming down the hall  Ben  Yeah  What happened to Francine?  I don't know  Her and Earl are both missing  Oh  The colors are uniting  They're uniting  Yeah  I don't know  Norton  Planning to overthrow the break room  Unless they spelt it wrong  On his official site  I thought it was a U  It is C-O-N-D-I-T  I really thought there was a U in there  All this time I've thought that  No  Here's Francine  They have a lot in common then  Why  Yeah you're right  Is one of those mine?  Yeah  One of those mine  Uh oh 
[02:18:30]  Oh boy  Which one is  No no no  Oh boy  Are you sure this one's mine?  There she goes  Thank you Francine  There she is Francine  As Francine gets ready on the microphone  Anthony  Why don't we play the  I told you she wasn't a fan  The jingle  She's a dips and a dope and a moron  She never learned to answer and do  She says that she's in college  But she can't tie her shoe  It's so easy to answer Francine  Ah  You like your jingle Francine? 
[02:19:00]  I think it's great  You do?  Yeah  Alright cool  Are you flattered by it?  Um  Not really  But I like it  You're not flattered by it though  Yeah okay  And you did a little  News  Yes I did  You talked about the news  Yeah  A little bit  I was reading all weekend  Oh you are or are you?  Uh huh  How'd that work for you?  Did you learn a lot?  Yeah  Yeah?  You like that reading thing?  Well I do read anyway 
[02:19:30]  But  Yeah?  I was reading news from newspapers  I don't usually do that  What do you usually read?  Um  I think it's Pride and Prejudice  Right now  Oh yeah?  Yeah  Hmm  Novels  Yeah  You like the novels  You don't read magazines  Or any news like that?  No  Where do you get your info from?  I told you  I usually just listen to you guys  Oh she gets her news  From the O&A show  We rarely talk about the news  That is really frightening  Because by the time we get on the air  Everyone else has discussed it 
[02:20:00]  Right  It's really the only reason  Yeah  And the way we talk about it  Isn't really a way to get your info  By the way  A lot of people want to know  When we're going to play  Rick's Christopher Street song  Oh yeah  We're going to play this  Before the next break  Because people want to tape it  Anthony  Okay?  Right  Alright Francine  So you went into the studio  And you riffed on the news  A little bit right?  Yes I did  And we got it on CD here  So we're going to start the tape  And we'll see where it goes  Okay?  Let's listen  Here's Francine  The angry intern  This is Ish  That made the news  And this week's  Angry Interns 
[02:20:30]  Weekend Review  In the general news  Eat it up Democrats  Most news reports  Thought Bush's speech  Last week sucked  David E. Sangers  Of the Times wrote  Stocks which were flat  When the president began  His speech began falling  After he finished  This comes after  Reports were made of  Bush's 1990  Harkham Energy stock  Which collapsed  Soon after he sold  $848,560  Worth of shares  Let's make like a priest  And come out the closet  Stop the lying  And just say you had 
[02:21:00]  A little fuzzy math problem  Bush  Mayor Giuliani  Lost  There you go  I thought you were  Talking in hip hop language  I didn't quite understand  Some of that  You might want to  Take a breath  You really were rolling quick  Well I asked Rick to redo it  And he said no  What was the first word you said  Was issue  Is there any way to play  Just the first two words again  They wouldn't let me do it over  We want to just keep going forward  What is the story  It was reviews on his speech 
[02:21:30]  Yeah  He made a speech  To who  To the  I think corporate America  Corporate America  About lying on their  Lying  Accounting  On their accounting  Yeah  Their accounting reviews  Oh  Their accounting  Yeah  Yeah  And you have a problem with this  No I don't have a problem with it  She was just reporting it  Yeah  You're unbiased basically  Yeah  I don't care  But come out the closet 
[02:22:00]  Yeah  What was that  Well you know  Stop lying  Like all the priests lie  About the little boy thing  Makes sense  But who should come out of the closet  The priest  And Bush too  He should just say  He lied about  The whole accounting thing  He was responsible  For the accounting thing  Yeah  Harkin Energy  Went down  I think  After he  I don't know  I forgot the whole story  But  He sold some shares  Yeah  Right before it went down  Yeah 
[02:22:30]  A whole lot of it  You're saying he had a little  Inside information  Yeah he had  There's no evidence of that  No but  If he did  He should just say he did it  Was he trying to buy  Bethlehem Steel  I don't know  Good question  That's a good stock to buy  Yeah  Because Blue Star  Blue Star was  Up and down for a while  And it was with the same  Harkin Energy thing  Oh yeah  Yeah  Okay  Well let's get back to the  It's the week in review  Not the weekend review  Right  But that's a small thing  Francine  Francine  Francine  Francine 
[02:23:00]  Francine  The angry intern  He lost  $8.6 million  Of $500,000  Upper East Side apartment  In custody of his  All right hold on  What happened here  I believe Mayor Giuliani  Ex-New York Mayor Giuliani  Bush  Mayor Giuliani  Lost $8.6 million  Of $500,000  Upper East Side apartment  In custody of his  Two kids  While gaining an  Undisclosed child support  Payment plan 
[02:23:30]  And his ex-wife's  Legal fees  Hold this for  Legal visitation rights  To Judy Nathan's  Vag  Yeah Rudy  You're a real winner  After telling  Governor Pataki  That he didn't deserve  Parole  Son of Sam  Hey  That's funny  I gotta give her that  That was good  Right  That's funny  All right  We like that one  That was short  And it was funny  Yeah  To the point  Thank you  And you had all the  Statistics and figures 
[02:24:00]  It was cool  Visitation to her  So you think  So you think that  He should have just  Stayed married  Yeah  He gave it all up  Just so he can get a little  But he didn't like  His wife anymore  But you know  He should have considered  The consequences  Now he has to  Pay a whole lot  Of money to her  Yeah it costs you  All kinds of money  To get out of a hell  Yeah  A hell relationship  But why should you  Leave it  I mean why shouldn't  You leave it  If you're not happy  He's getting some  Prime Vag now though  I don't think it was worth it  You can't put a price tag 
[02:24:30]  On Prime Vag  Oh yes you can  With that price tag  Well you can  I guess  If you live in  Norton's little world  All right  Well let's move on  To the next one here  I don't know where  The stories begin and end  So I have to keep  Rewinding a little bit here  Tacky that he didn't  Deserve parole  Son of Sam  Killer  David Berkowitz  Or Berkowitz  Told officials  That he would get  Drunk high  And then kill  Killing innocent people  Isn't cool  But here's a list  Of some dumbasses  Who should have  Been killed last week  Tourist Justin Schoenberg 
[02:25:00]  Howard Marzen  And James Brandon  Were all stupid enough  To attend Spain's  San Fermin Festival  Of all the festivals  In the world  They chose  One in which  Raging bulls  Come after him  In open streets  Ugh  California's  And incidentally  David Berkowitz  Did not get parole  Oh  Yeah  No I said  He didn't get it  Right  Oh okay  Yeah I think  I wasn't sure  Because I like  The whole lack  Of inflection thing  He didn't get any  So  So these three guys  Should be killed 
[02:25:30]  For  Yeah I thought  They should just die  I mean why  Are they going there  There's tons of  Other festivals  Around the world  Why do they want  To go in the streets  To run with the bulls  Yeah they're stupid  Well running with the bulls  Is a very popular  Tourist  It's like an old  Like custom  That they do over there  It's like walking  Into Weight Watchers  With a pizza in your hand  Going anybody hungry  And running out the door  But they should be killed  Because there's other festivals  They should go to  Yeah  Name one other festival  They should have went to  Rio's Carnival  That's pretty cool  What?
