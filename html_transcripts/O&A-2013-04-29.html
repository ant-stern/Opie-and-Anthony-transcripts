<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Greg Hughes, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton introducing themselves and their uncensored style.  The show initially focused on a recent UFC fight between Jon Jones and Chael Sonnen, specifically debating whether Jones's broken toe should have resulted in a loss, analyzing fight footage of the injury, and fielding listener calls about the fight's rules and outcome.

Jim Norton then recounted his experiences: appearing on Mark Maron's podcast with Janine Garofalo and other comedians, attending Mike Tyson's hilariously brutal one-man show (including stories about Don King, Robin Givens, and Brad Pitt), getting a photo with Tyson and Jake LaMotta, and a humorous anecdote about a children's birthday party overrun with unsupervised kids.  He also mentioned an upcoming show with Joe Rogan.  The hosts then discussed their experiences with non-alcoholic beer, their ability to quit habits abruptly (using examples of smoking and a coin-toss divorce), and upcoming appearances by Anthony Bourdain and Mike Tyson.  They discussed Tyson's one-man show, its candid nature, and his animated stage presence, recalling previous Tyson appearances on the show.  The conversation touched on the 21st anniversary of the Rodney King riots, including anecdotes about fear on Long Island and descriptions of violence and looting, and urban legends about gang colors and Halloween costumes.  Further discussion of Tyson's one-man show detailed anecdotes about his drug use, Don King, and his past, and the hosts expressed surprise at continued affection for Tyson despite his past transgressions.  Michael Jordan's recent marriage and expensive divorce were also discussed.  The show then transitioned to Anthony Bourdain's recent ATV accident while filming "Parts Unknown," detailing the dangers faced filming in the Congo, including encounters with corrupt officials and rebel groups, culminating in Bourdain's arrival in the studio.

The interview with Anthony Bourdain covered his experiences filming in the Congo and Libya, describing the post-colonial state of the Congo, the exploitation under King Leopold II, and ongoing conflicts. He discussed the challenges of working in dangerous areas, his coping mechanisms, and his preference for relaxing vacations over adventurous excursions.  He shared anecdotes about unusual foods, a UFC fight he attended, and his CNN show, "Parts Unknown," including upcoming episodes and a previous segment with Keenan Cahill that had low viewership due to Opie's commentary.  The conversation also included a discussion of a colorized *I Love Lucy* episode and anecdotes about Desi Arnaz.

The show then moved to a discussion of George Jones's biggest hits (revealing the hosts' limited country music knowledge), a listener survey on George Jones songs, and the show's short shelf life for guest likability.  A quest to find and consume HÃ¡karl (fermented shark) ensued, accompanied by humorous commentary and expressions of revulsion.  Mike Tyson's extended in-studio visit followed, covering his personal life, opinions on current events (including Tim Tebow and a politician's alleged affair), anecdotes about his career, and his one-man show, with frequent use of crude and sexually explicit language.  The Iron Sheik's past appearance, including an on-air urination incident, was also recalled.  A brief unplanned appearance by Gary Busey was mentioned, leading to discussion of Busey's upcoming after-show appearance.

The show concluded with a segment featuring Gary Busey.  The interview centered around his near-death motorcycle accident, near-death experiences, spiritual awakenings, his appearances on *Celebrity Apprentice* (including interactions with Donald Trump and perceived betrayals by Penn and Lisa), his "abuseisms," promotion of his book and website, his foundation for children's Kawasaki disease, anecdotes from his past (including his portrayal of Buddy Holly, a meeting with Mike Tyson, and a trip to South Africa), and past struggles with drug addiction, including a cocaine overdose.  The hosts playfully riffed on Busey's eccentric personality, suggesting a "Sexual Sponge" Twitter handle, and the segment ended with Busey promoting his upcoming musical projects.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg Audio!  Antonio!  Ooh!  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live now? Is it happening? This is it? 
[00:00:30]  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level. 
[00:01:00]  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yes.  And another week.  This old gag.  This old gag. 
[00:01:30]  Gag-a-rooney.  How bad did Jon Jones beat Chael?  Not many people were picking Sun in the end.  Nah, I mean, Jones is just too good.  And it was bad.  It was a weird night for UFC.  There was a couple of eye pokes.  It just didn't happen.  And Jon Jones broke his toe?  Yeah, badly.  I saw the video.  Had the ref not stopped, I think the ref stopped at a couple seconds too soon. 
[00:02:00]  But literally there was nothing Chael was going to do.  And Jones' toe, I guess, was broken at that point.  So what would have happened if the round finished is there's no way Jones could have come out for that second round.  It's no way.  So they would have had to have just stopped the fight.  And I think Jones would have just kept it up because he won the one round they did fight decisively.  His toe was upside down.  It was terrible.  Oh my God, it's unbelievable.  It was upside down.  And when you see the post-fight interview, Jones was sitting there. 
[00:02:30]  And he reminded me of me when he kicked me.  The feeling of, like, that feeling your body's going into, like, a slight shock from a certain visual or feeling.  Because he was sitting down.  Joe got him a bench to sit, like, yeah, they do the post-fight interview.  Right.  And then he looked down and realized his toe was broken, but during the interview.  And he was, like, he looked woozy.  So Rogan got him a little chair to sit on.  And you could see him holding his belt, like.  Is this it? 
[00:03:00]  Let me see.  Right heavyweight champion of the world, Johnny Bones Jones.  Look at Rogan.  He's an animal.  Yeah.  He's looking at Rogan.  He has no idea right there, Jones.  Oh, he looks down.  He just looks down.  Oh, he's got a broken foot.  All right, have a seat.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, champ.  First of all, I'm sorry about the injury.  You okay to talk right now?  All right.  All right.  Come on.  This has been this whole experience with coaching. 
[00:03:30]  He's pretty even heavier.  He's a little bit heavier.  And then competing against him with all the trash talk and everything.  Very unusual situation.  Give us your take on it all now that it's over and you're victorious.  Well, I wasn't planning on breaking my big toe.  It's all nasty, man.  Yeah.  I was supposed to go to Jamaica after this.  No.  I don't think that's going to happen.  Well, look.  He didn't even know.  Obviously, you're in some serious pain, man.  I'd love to talk to you about this if you can, though.  Can you talk?  Yeah, I'm all right, man.  You know, I was just so happy to get past Chosan.  Chosan is an awesome opponent. 
[00:04:00]  We went through a lot of drama, and it motivated me a lot.  You were very serious and very motivated leading up to this fight.  Was it because of all the trash talk you wanted to make sure that there was no way this  guy beat you?  He's squeezing the belt.  Yeah, definitely.  You know, I really wanted to try to chill Chosan and chill Chosan.  And I think I did a good job at that.  Yeah, that was what I wanted to ask you about.  Like, your strategy, you chose to go after him and clinch with him and take him to the  ground and do to him what he planned to do to you.  Why did you do that?  Just to prove it to him?  Yeah, you know, my coach teaches me to have a screw-that attitude.  So, if people are saying you're going to get out-wrestled, you've got to say screw that. 
[00:04:30]  I'm going to out-wrestle him.  You're like, don't accept being lesser than other people, you know?  You owe it to yourself to believe and to work really hard.  Jesus Christ.  He looked.  Yeah, he definitely looked like he went, oh, fuck.  Yeah, it looked like he went.  I'm sure it was very painful, but I think it was also the shock of seeing it.  How'd he break it?  I didn't get to watch the fights.  Well, they don't show you during the fight.  You saw the video.  Bob Kelly posted a video on his Twitter of it.  Yeah.  It gets caught in the mat while he's doing something, and you can just see it, Ben. 
[00:05:00]  Seeing it on Bobby's Twitter.  Here you go, right there.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It goes upside down.  It goes.  It's like the only thing holding it on is the skin, almost.  Oh!  Holy shit.  That's fucked up.  That's a rough one.  That's fucked up.  Can you take that?  No.  No, it's painful.  I like how it just goes.  Yeah, it flips over.  But the adrenaline, he might have thought he was cramping in that moment.  I would love to ask him, what did you think? 
[00:05:30]  Did you notice anything in that moment?  God.  Yeah, let's put that up on our Facebook there, Iraq, Opie, and Anthony, if you want to see  John Jones' toe.  If you haven't seen it yet, just completely flip over.  I'll tell you the highlight of that night for me, though, was fucking big country, Roy  Nelson, fucking knocking out Czech Congo.  Roy Nelson is a fucking behemoth.  Yeah, he's a big fat guy, right?  He destroyed him.  It's like a fucking cannonball, his right hand.  His right hand is like a fucking cannonball. 
[00:06:00]  Jimmy, I think you got it wrong.  If he doesn't come out for the second round, I think he loses.  No.  Why?  Because they had an injury earlier.  Right.  An eye poke.  But the eye poke's illegal, right?  Yes.  I think there's a difference.  I think if you can't come out because you broke your toe, I think you lose.  Oh, you know what?  You might be right.  Yeah.  Wow, I didn't know that.  Because it's not an illegal move, breaking your toe.  But I think that the fight, the eye poke's illegal, but it's incidental. 
[00:06:30]  It wasn't on purpose.  I'd like to know the answer to this.  And they wound up judging by the rounds they'd already fought.  Right.  Do you know the rules on that, Mars?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hopi, you're absolutely right.  If they would have stopped it, Shell Sonnen would have won.  Wow.  You can't continue.  Even if you wanted to continue, you have a protruding bone coming out your skin, broken skin.  Right.  You can't.  Oh, see, I thought that what they do there is that they judge the round that they already fought.  But I guess you're right if a fighter can't face.  But if it's a broken toe? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, man, that's just bad luck, I think.  And how bad did he beat him in the first round?  He beat him badly enough.  I mean, it was extremely dominant.  Wow, I didn't know.  So when they did the eye poke, remember there was an eye poke that stopped the fight, which  Rogan was just raving about the gloves, so they got to just figure those gloves out because  people keep getting poked.  Right.  What, how come they gave it to the guy, I think, who did the poking?  Like Bisping, Michael Bisping. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, he got it?  Yeah.  I think it was past the first round.  How many rounds did they go through?  They were, I think, in the third, but they were still almost finished with the third.  They had to stop the fight.  Oh, maybe the difference is one time they had to stop the fight and once is you don't answer  the bell.  I wonder if anybody out there knows the answer to that, because I would love to know.  And you get penalized for an eye poke, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  If it's on purpose.  If it's on purpose.  If it's on purpose.  Right, right.  Of course.  Yeah.  I think Chael would have won if John Jones doesn't come out for the second round.  Yeah.  That referee kind of stopped.  Wow.  He was getting beat up, but he kind of stopped it a little too early.  I think so, too. 
[00:08:00]  A little bit.  A couple seconds.  A few more time.  Really?  Yeah.  Want to ask Chael that?  Maybe he's happy that thing.  Yeah, right.  He was, but then afterwards it was a good stoppage.  He did say that?  Yeah.  I think he realized he was in trouble.  Fuck, that toe flipping over.  How long does that take to heal?  Oh, that thing just...  Oh, my God.  You could see exactly when it popped.  It just spun over.  Oh, God.  That's bad.  We would have to take a week off from radio if that happened to us.  Oh, a week? 
[00:08:30]  Easily.  A month.  There's not a man.  There's not a person in this room that could take that.  I would get all woozy and queasy thinking about it.  Like, I'd be like, yeah, I think I'm all right.  The doctor said it and everything's close.  It's like, oh, I think I'm going to throw up.  I'd be all woozy.  That's what he looked like.  He was going to just vomit.  Yeah.  If you are the champ, you need to be beat.  You can't lose by default.  So, wow, we'd still have a conversation here.  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  Hey, how you doing? 
[00:09:00]  Oh, how you doing?  All right, brother.  Yeah, that's always been the rule in boxing.  Going way back is that if you are the champ, you can't just lose by some sort of default  or by technicality or something.  You're already the champ, so you have to actually be beat.  All right, but he has a broken toe, so that's him being beat.  No, no, that's an accident or injury or something.  I don't know if it's an accident.  Let me ask you a question.  I don't know if I was right because, like, say a boxer can't face the eighth round. 
[00:09:30]  He sits there and he cannot come out because of injuries.  I know it's a difference between a toe and this.  And what if you have a broken cheekbone and you can't come out?  Don't you lose?  A lot of people are saying John would have lost the fight.  I'm thinking that you're right, that he would have.  I hadn't put that together like that, but you're right.  I understand your point, Chris, but I think this means he would have lost the fight.  He couldn't come out for the second round.  Everybody would have accepted you the champ.  When you're the champ, you're actually the champ.  But he didn't break his toe because of something that was done illegally by Chael Sonnet. 
[00:10:00]  No.  No, it doesn't matter.  It would have to be a knockout or, you know, a...  I don't know about that.  I'm standing with my original thought.  I think John Jones would have lost.  Yeah, I think you're right.  If he didn't come out for the second round.  Well, we'll just have to agree that this is...  All right.  That was a good point that you can't face...  You can't come out after the bell.  Yeah, it's a broken toe.  But again, especially in mixed martial arts where heel hooks are legal. 
[00:10:30]  Like, if you're fighting someone and you break their arm and they can't come out, you win the fight.  Yes.  If you're not fighting the champ.  No, but even if you're fighting the champ, if you break his arm...  Say me and Jones are fighting and I was the champ.  All right.  Jimmy's the champ.  More realistically, Jones broke my arm.  At the end of the first round, Jones breaks my arm.  So I go and sit down and I realize I can't come out and face the bell.  They're going to say it's a draw because Jones broke my arm? 
[00:11:00]  No, I lose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I know that.  I've seen that.  But I think that the thing with the champ...  Well, now it's I think.  Yeah, no.  I know why you're saying that.  You have to beat the champion.  Like, you have to really...  You can't just squeak past the champion.  You have to beat him for his belt.  But in this case, I think that counts as beating him for his belt, even though it's not what  Chael would have wanted, I'm sure.  And it didn't happen.  Remember, he tripped and hurt his foot.  He didn't actually...  As long as everything is on the up and up and legal, I think Jon Jones loses if he doesn't 
[00:11:30]  come out for the second round.  He didn't trip and hurt it.  So what do you mean?  Yeah.  I think what you're talking about, if Chael Sonnen was just giving him illegal eye pokes  over and over again and he couldn't come out for the second round, then you've got  a situation like you're talking about, I believe.  It's a very tricky situation.  A very tricky situation.  And we're all just believing, I think.  All right, Chris.  All right.  I'm going to hang up and listen to myself on the radio.  All right.  You did a good job, Chris.  Be proud.  Be proud.  I wish we were so early in LA we could talk to Joe.  I know.  And we'll find out by the end of the show.  Oh, we certainly will. 
[00:12:00]  I do believe you lose.  I think you're right, actually.  Let's see what the phone's saying.  A lot of people saying, yeah, Jon Jones would have lost.  I can't explain what would have happened at the...  Okay, this guy could explain from Canada.  Travis, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  How are you?  I'm pretty good.  So my personal understanding of what I think, I think Jones would have lost the fight because  he couldn't continue.  However, the way Dana White kind of likes to go things, he probably would have kept on 
[00:12:30]  to the interim belt for light heavyweight and they just would have held a rematch.  So they kind of would have been the two title holders for the class or the weight class  until...  Now you're throwing a whole nother fucking monkey wrench into this.  But can they do that?  Because it's governed by the Athletic Commission.  So what are the rules?  Yeah, man.  I don't know if Dana White can do that.  There's got to be a written ruling.  Yeah.  What is the actual rule?  The actual rule.  You break your toe and it was no illegal activity.  So now you can't come out for the second round.  Who wins the fight?  I think you're right. 
[00:13:00]  I think Jon Jones wins the fight.  Loses the fight at that point.  Right.  Yeah, if you can't continue, you lose the fight.  Right.  Even if you're the champ.  It's the same kind of thing with Georges St-Pierre when he got hurt.  He got hurt and they had to create the interim belt until he can continue.  Boy, didn't he get hurt?  Hold on.  Didn't he get hurt in training for the fight?  Yeah, yeah.  That's totally different.  Oh, my God.  All right, Travis.  Hands down.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, I think he got hurt.  We get hurt training for a fight.  Everyone has the answer until you pick up their fucking call. 
[00:13:30]  And they blurt out nonsense.  Well, we're going to take one more because this guy says I can give you the actual rule.  Oh, okay.  David in Texas.  What's up, boys?  Amen.  Good.  Okay, so here's the deal.  Under the MMA Unified rules, it's considered a medical disqualification by Jon Jones.  So he would have lost the belt.  Chael would have become the light heavyweight champion.  The deal with the interim belt is that the champion is not able to defend his belt. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  There wouldn't be any interim championships until, like, you know, like, for example,  like if Jon Jones would have won the fight, but then he would have broke his toe during  training, and he couldn't defend his belt.  Mm-hmm.  Then for X period of time, like, for example, with Dominic Cruz, right, you know, like,  they took, you know, 18 months before Dana decided to go through and create an interim  belt, which is when Faber and Burrell fought.  So, and then they created a unified interim title, and then Cruz is still out right now. 
[00:14:30]  Okay.  So, yeah, so basically it would have been considered a medical disqualification.  Jones would have lost.  Chael would have become dead.  Light heavyweight champ.  Wow, okay.  Thank you very much, man.  That was well said.  Thank you.  Yeah, there you go.  Light heavyweight champ.  And then the next fight, obviously, that would have been a rematch.  Right.  And, uh...  Yeah, Chael would have done an immediate rematch as soon as...  Now, the bad part about that is it would have totally screwed up the deal for the  John Jones-Vinerson-Silva-Suka fight.  I don't...  Do you know, be honest with you, dude, Silva's fighting Weidman. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, sorry.  He's fighting Weidman next.  Chris Weidman.  That fight will probably happen.  I'm guessing they're waiting for something like legalization in New York or something.  They're talking like that.  It's absolutely going to happen.  Jones-Silva.  Holy shit.  They're talking about Madison Square Garden.  Yeah.  The UFC 20th anniversary is coming up in November, and apparently, well, Dana won't disclose  exactly who Silva's talking about, but apparently Silva came up to work.  White, after the fight, said that he wants his next fight after Weidman to be a super fight. 
[00:15:30]  So, I think what we're probably going to see is that since Jones all hopped up right now on,  you know, he tied Peter Orchee's record on this last fight for most title defenses,  so on his next one, he's going to go for, you know, obviously breaking the record,  and Silva's spot at 205, like, a whole bunch of times.  So, my guess is going to be is that they're probably going to go through,  go for the 20th anniversary in November, and have Silva go up to 205, and then fight Jones, 
[00:16:00]  and then basically Jones is going to have to prove whether or not he's been in that part  to be able to take Silva down in 205.  I think you're incorrect, and I think Silva's going to fight George St. Pierre.  No.  Really?  Yeah.  Huh.  I think so.  Yeah, but I think Dana White would give him a relatively easy fight to get the record,  don't you think?  Who, Jones?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, somebody else before November, maybe.  Relatively easy.  I don't know about that, but the sheer amount of money that that would bring in with the 
[00:16:30]  Super 5 between Jones and Silva, because if you look at, like, any of the anime forums,  they've been going crazy over Jones and Silva for months now.  Yeah.  Right on.  Because then George St. Pierre, like, I mean, he just finished doing the Captain America  movie, or he's the new Captain America movie, and he just got finished wrapping up with  that, and he wants to do the Johnny Hendricks fight.  The thing with GSP, when it comes down to the Super 5 with Silva, is there's this big  contention on, basically, George St. Pierre wants Silva to come all the way down to 170, 
[00:17:00]  which is craziness, because Silva walks around at, like, 225, 230, so he basically wants that  cut to be as painful as humanly possible for him to be able to fight at 170.  So they've already had, like, this back-and-forth deal with, you know, Silva agreeing that he'd  fight at 177, and then GSP came up at Prince of R.A. saying that they wanted to come all  the way down to 174.  They've had all this done, like, multiple times, so I really think GSP doesn't really 
[00:17:30]  want to go down that road, so I think it's probably going to be Chuck Silva.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, buddy, very much.  This guy knows things.  Yeah, this guy definitely knows his shit.  He knows things.  Thank you, David.  You might be right.  Hey, Jimmy, come back to Dallas, man.  Thank you, buddy.  I was just in Austin.  It was very good.  They told Kennedy.  Yeah, exactly.  I was going to go to Dallas because I saw my picture with a treason written over.  I wanted for treason.  How was Austin, man?  It was good.  I mean, you know, it was a midnight show Saturday night, and I'm like, I had heard that when 
[00:18:00]  Jezelnik was on, people were yelling.  Not, like, nasty, but they were just yelling, like, you know, do rape, Joe.  Like, they were just, you know, being crazy and loud.  Yikes.  And I haven't talked to Anthony, so I'd be interested to hear if it was fun, if he enjoyed  it.  But I was, like, a little worried about it.  I'm like, fuck, man.  It's the last show of the festival.  It's late.  It ain't sold out.  It's after two Gaffigan's sold-out fucking extravaganzas.  But it turned out to be great.  I mean, the crowd was excellent.  The theater was excellent.  And fuck the festival.  It took good care of me. 
[00:18:30]  The Moontown Festival.  Me and Ant, we sit here last Friday, looking at little Jimmy Norton, and now we see you  again today, and in between, you go out there and see the world.  He's out and about.  He's out there.  I was in Texas, yeah.  In the world.  I did Mark's podcast.  Just seeing the country.  Yeah.  It was weird.  It was, I was a little nervous about doing the podcast, too, because we had that, I mean,  everything's okay.  Everybody's, you know, freaked out about Mark.  Yeah, I know.  We're happy with him.  I explained on Twitter, I never had a problem with Mark Maron personally. 
[00:19:00]  That's why I never mentioned him by name.  You know, he was caught in the crossfire.  I mean, the fact is, Howard Stern makes a deal with either publicists or guests or whatever  the fuck, and the company allows it to happen where no one's allowed to talk to his guests  before he does.  So Mark got kind of caught up in that.  Yeah, and then Mark wasn't like, Mark's like, no, I was just already flying out the next day.  He's like, I'll change my flight.  Like, he was so, he was really shocked that that whole thing happened, that he wasn't being  a dick, and he wasn't blowing, like, you know. 
[00:19:30]  So I was really happy to hear that.  He was, like, he was genuinely surprised at the whole thing.  Mm-hmm.  And so I saw him that night.  You know, we chatted beforehand, and I was, you know, the podcast was all, like, with myself  and some alternative, quote-unquote alternative, like, just not my crowd at all.  Right.  It was Janine Garofalo, and...  How's she?  She's nice.  You know, it's funny.  Janine and I had never really spoken until last year when I shot something with her.  Not with her, with the same director she had used.  Because I liked how her special looked physically. 
[00:20:00]  So when I shot Please Be Offended, I was using the same director.  So I'm like, I don't know anybody who used him.  I said, Janine Garofalo did.  I said to my manager, let me, can you call her manager and see would she mind me emailing?  So I wanted to ask her a couple of questions.  And so John gets back to me and goes, well, she doesn't have email.  She's just not into that shit at all.  She goes, but she said, she's not into that shit.  She just doesn't have it.  A lot of people have email, but they're not into it.  She does not have it.  You kind of have to have email.  But she said, you're more than welcome to call us.  So she gave me her number and I called.  We talked for a while. 
[00:20:30]  She was really sweet.  So the first time I've seen her in a year was Friday night.  And it was nice.  I got a chance to thank her and talk about the experience.  And she was great.  She was really fucking nice.  And we had never spoken person to person other than the occasional bump into each other and just didn't talk.  So it was nice seeing her.  And Maria, would you fuck her?  You know what?  It's funny.  I don't think she would, but she looks good, man.  I mean, yeah, she's slim and she looks really good.  I was looking at her while I was talking.  I was like, I don't think she gave me that vibe at all. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, but if the opportunity presented itself, of course.  I'm not an idiot.  Goody, goody for you.  Maria Bamford.  She's really funny, right?  Yeah, she's great.  The little, I've only seen clips here and there, but she fucking cracks me up.  She's a strange bird.  She's very strange.  Is she crazy?  No.  No.  She's nuts.  She's nutty.  She comes across nuts.  Yeah.  She's in, you know, Vasa Bonny's movie.  And she fucking has some great scenes in it.  Yeah, she's funny.  She's definitely her own person. 
[00:21:30]  She's certainly not like any other comic.  Right.  Todd Barry was on it.  And Michael Ian Black was hilarious on it.  And Mark and Dom Marrero went out for a while, too.  That's a lot of people for a podcast.  Yeah.  Mark brings you out, talks to you, and then you move down one seat.  It was, you know, a few hundred people.  And Dom had to leave because he had another gig.  And Bill Burr was supposed to be right after me, but Burr ran late on his show, I think,  so he didn't make it over.  So we wound up talking about sex and stuff.  And, you know, he was asking me at the Ron Jeremy store.  And I felt like I was like, oh, God, I'm being so dirty. 
[00:22:00]  I felt like I was wrecking his podcast.  Because that crap, like, you know, like when you listen to all those other acts, they had  a certain rapport and a certain, it's almost like being in front of an Opie and Anthony  audience and coming out and doing something that wouldn't work for that audience.  But the crowd liked it.  It was fun.  And it felt comfortable.  But I just felt like self-conscious, which is probably just my own shit.  Because Mark said, oh, I loved it.  So I felt better.  But I felt like, oh, fuck, I'm being too dirty.  You know, you get self-conscious about your own shit. 
[00:22:30]  But you're smart.  Yeah, but I was talking about piss.  I mean, he was asking me at Golden State.  I was like, who wouldn't want to talk about it?  Of course.  Yeah.  So it was a very fun weekend in Austin.  I did not love the food in the hotel.  That was my only complaint.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  What happened?  It just wasn't amazing.  My God, what did they do wrong?  It wasn't great.  Oh, God.  24-hour, though?  What could we do to make that better?  Kenny noticed it, too.  Did Kenny rub your belly?  Everything okay?  He rubbed my shoulders.  And I rubbed his because he complained, too.  All right.  So, long story short, Mark Maron will be doing our show Thursday.  Yes.  Thursday? 
[00:23:00]  Thursday.  Nice.  Nice seeing Opie out and about last night.  Yeah, I'm trying to get out there a little more.  I did two things in a week.  Two things?  I did Amy Schumer's premiere party.  I mean, Amy Schumer's show.  When does it start officially?  Tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night.  I think she's going to do really well, man.  Amy is going to do fine.  Her show is really, really fucking funny.  Yeah.  And then last night, Roland texted me around 6.15 to remind me that I got tickets to Mike Tyson.  You got tickets to Mike Tyson. 
[00:23:30]  And I, in my head, I thought it was Tuesday, so I'm planning for Tuesday to get a babysitter.  Me and the wife will probably go or whatever.  I'm like, what the fuck?  And my wife was gone all day yesterday doing some shit.  And I'm like, I don't think I'm going to be able to make it in time.  Long story short, though, she got home and I ran up to the Beacon Theater to check out Mike Tyson's one-man show.  Holy fuck was it good, huh, Jim?  It was unbelievable.  You got to go, Ant.  I know he's playing Westbury, I think.  Sunday.  This coming Sunday. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Tickets still available.  So I highly recommend, if you're close to Westbury Music Fair, whatever.  Oh, certainly.  What do they call it now?  I don't know.  It's some bank theater.  It's the Westbury Music Fair.  Yeah, it's the Westbury Music Fair.  I would highly recommend you see this.  He's a funny guy, man.  Yeah, he's hilarious.  He's fucking hilarious.  And wasn't it great?  He talked in his own, like, you don't feel like you're reading some politically correct or hearing some politically correct script.  I mean, that's how this guy talks to people. 
[00:24:30]  The language was fucking brutal and funny and honest, and there was no mincing bullshit, no, like, trying to be nice when he didn't have to be nice.  It was just honest.  Yeah, real honest.  I heard, well, from what you were saying, he wasn't really fessing up to...  Well, I was telling Ant, like, he doesn't really want to fess up too much, though.  He didn't rape Desiree Washington.  Got an excuse for everything.  Biting Evander Holyfield was not his problem.  It was the refs not doing their job.  Sal should do a fucking show, then. 
[00:25:00]  He could get on and talk about how he doesn't do anything that he's responsible for.  Robin Givens was the real problem.  He wasn't the problem.  I didn't know Robin Givens was going out with Brad Pitt.  Yeah.  I remember hearing that story many years ago.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Tyson and Robin Givens were sort of broken up, but they were still kind of fooling around  with each other, and Tyson went to the house waiting for Robin Givens, and coming up the  long driveway in a car that he bought for her is Robin Givens with some blonde in the 
[00:25:30]  passenger seat.  It turns out to be Brad Pitt.  Could have been O.J. right there.  And then Brad Pitt pops out of the car and realizes it's Mike Tyson, and just how Tyson  tells the story.  It's terrific.  It's really, really funny, man.  Really funny.  I actually believe him about Desiree Washington now, though.  I actually believe it when he talked about it.  And I believe it when he talked about it in Toback's story, because of the way he was  so fucking angry at her still.  Because he said something like, there's a lot of shit I've done that I should have went  to jail for, but this was not one of them. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  And there's something about the way he addresses her, and the anger, especially in that Toback  thing when he was raw and fresh out of rehab.  Like, I believe his fucking venom at Don King.  And he talks about being a crook and a fucking criminal, and he talks about what happened  with that fucking 12-year-old girl when he was 15, and how people did get it wrong.  But he confesses to that, and to drugs, and fucking...  I thought he was pretty open about a lot of stuff, but the stuff that people got wrong, 
[00:26:30]  he was really bothered by.  Yeah.  I wish he got into the Don King stuff a little more.  Yeah.  He would mention Don King throughout the show, and just basically say, fuck you, Don King.  That's as far as he would really go.  But at one point, you learn that Mike Tyson had $400 million in the bank.  And he doesn't have anywhere as near that anymore.  That's a lot of fucking cake.  When he got out of jail.  So, he doesn't have anything close to that.  How do you get close to that?  $400 million. 
[00:27:00]  Bad people around you.  Wow.  That's a lot of bad people.  Well, he finally audited Don King and Don King's people and stuff, trying to figure out  where the fuck all his money was going.  And Don King was charging him $8,000...  Was it a day or a week?  $8,000 a week for towels.  For towels.  Towels.  Don King actually billed Mike Tyson $8,000 a week for towels.  What a fucking cock.  That's almost $100,000 for the year.  It's more than that. 
[00:27:30]  $8,000 a week times 52 weeks is over $400,000 a year.  What was I thinking?  A month.  You're probably thinking a month.  You're thinking $96,000.  Holy shit.  I was thinking a month.  Yeah, that's...  Holy fuck.  You're right.  Well over $400,000.  And he even repeated it for the balcony.  He's like, people in the balcony, they're not feeling me down here.  $8,000 a week for towels.  Holy fuck.  You're right.  Yeah.  I was thinking for a month.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  That's like $430,000 or something a fucking year in towels.  But he tells a great story. 
[00:28:00]  I think he talked for an hour and 40 minutes, I want to say.  I can't believe it was that long.  And there was no intermission.  You didn't need an intermission.  I loved it.  When it ended, I was kind of bummed because I was definitely ready to hear some more stuff.  Because there's big chunks of his career that he just couldn't get into too much.  Because he had so much shit that happened to this guy.  Amazing.  The Cuss stuff was fucking fascinating.  His relationship with Cuss D'Amato.  Right.  And there's one point where he talks about breaking away from his friends. 
[00:28:30]  And how that one guy said, no, no, this is, don't.  They were going to go out.  He said he was getting with Cuss.  And he was going to go out and keep robbing people.  And the one guy stopped him.  Like he said, the guy was a 5%er, which was this hardcore black dude's getting high.  And he's like, just don't.  And that 5%er dude ended up dying.  He got shot a week later.  A week after he was talking to Tyson.  Whoops.  But there's so many fucking near misses with Mike Tyson.  And so many things that should have derailed him early on. 
[00:29:00]  And it's interesting that he fucking, you know, made it through.  He was great.  I loved it.  Again, I loved it.  Called Spike Lee a racist a couple times.  Yeah, it was funny.  Yeah, because there's some things in the, I don't want to give the whole fucking thing away.  Some very funny reveals and shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  He says something and you're like, wow, that's kind of racist.  And then he goes, ah, that's some Spike Lee shit.  He wrote it to this.  That's my racist ass.  It was very funny.  It was funny.  And I went back afterwards.  You guys could have too, but I know you were tired. 
[00:29:30]  I was tired.  I needed to fucking sleep.  And I got, of course, got my, I had to get my, Mike was so fucking nice.  He was so fucking nice.  And, you know, I got a picture with him and Bobby Kelly.  And, you know, I had a champ as, gave me a hug.  Oh, well.  But then I was like, fucking Jake LaMotta was right there.  And I'm like, I took one with Bobby and Jake.  I'm like, I got to get Tyson and Jake.  Like, can I do that?  Oh, you must have been like, I got to make this. 
[00:30:00]  Were you obsessing?  Well, not really, because I didn't want to, you know, I was like, we've interviewed him.  Not really means yes, by the way.  I don't listen to the not really anymore.  He was obsessing.  But I wasn't going to interfere.  Thinking out great, that picture.  Right.  I wasn't going to interfere with Mike talking to other people, because I didn't want to monopolize his time.  And the publicist took amazing care of us.  And her, you know, she was great to us.  So, like, I didn't want to interfere.  So, I said to Mike at one point, he had a second by himself.  I'm like, hey, Mike, can I get a shot with you and Jake?  And he goes, yeah. 
[00:30:30]  And he actually, we had to walk over.  So, he walked me over.  Jeez, you got balls.  Mike made that happen.  Right.  That picture.  Because we had to walk over.  They weren't just standing together.  Right.  For me to get the picture you got, those guys would have to be not even talking to each other,  because then I would feel like I'm interrupting them.  They would have to just be standing right next to each other.  No, with enough space in between for you to jump in.  Would you be able to go to Mike Tyson and go, can I get a picture with you and Jake LaMotta?  No.  Not even. 
[00:31:00]  No.  It's not even a thought in my head to try to work that out.  Well, they had stood together and were talking and taking pictures, but I didn't want to  interrupt them.  That's why I didn't get it when they were together.  That's why you're better than us.  Only the psychopath does that.  But, dude, look at that shot.  Mike, do you mind if we get a picture with Jake LaMotta and then Mike has to walk you over  to Jake?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I would collapse before that happened.  Look at that shot, though.  That's fucking Tyson and the Raging Bull, man.  I'm out of my mind for that shot.  And everyone knew when Jake LaMotta entered the Beacon Theater, he's an old man with his  big black Johnny Cash type cowboy hat. 
[00:31:30]  And he took his seat.  I'm sure he blocked someone's view because he refused to take his hat off.  Bill, George, Obama, could we get a picture with Jimmy over there?  Could you guys come over here?  No, not a chance.  He's 91, LaMotta.  That's 91, huh?  He's 90 fucking one.  No kidding.  And I went on YouTube and I got home, which is why I mentioned this moment, because I  was just thinking about Jake and how he was retired before Ali fought. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he fought Sugar Ray Robinson six times.  And I was watching some footage, the final fight.  I think he only beat Ray once.  But he knocked Ray down for a nine count once.  He knocked him through the ropes one time.  And Sugar Ray never got him down.  So I was watching the stoppage of when Ray Robinson fucking was pummeling LaMotta and how  LaMotta almost went down.  He didn't go down.  I was like, he was a fucking tough son of a bitch.  Hey, Ray.  You never knocked me down, Ray. 
[00:32:30]  That's exactly what it was.  You never knocked me down, Ray.  In the real fight, you don't see him address him.  I don't know if he does or not, but they show, like LaMotta is, it's like the 13th round  is beating.  All swollen and bloody.  You never knocked me down, Ray.  Ray is fucking pummeling him.  Why didn't he go down for these blows?  What the fuck?  Wow.  He should have went down.  This could be one of their six fights, but he was just a tough.  All right.  Is this the final fight, Sam?  Do you know or no?  It's the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.  That might be the fifth fight where I think that Robinson won a decision. 
[00:33:00]  I'm not sure.  But he could take some massive punches.  Yeah.  He is.  I hear Tyson might stop by and say hi.  He's not officially booked, but he might stop by and say hi.  We've had him on twice already.  He's great.  He's awesome.  I just want to hug him.  I just want to hug the guy.  So ask him for hug.  I mean, I don't need it that bad.  I'm just saying.  Mike, he loved your show so much.  I'd hug Tyson in a second.  He hugged me.  I was like, you know, a couple of friends just hugging.  Dude, he was just great, man. 
[00:33:30]  It was so much fun.  Yeah.  It really was.  And the Mitch Green story.  Oh, my God.  It went on for like 10, 15 minutes.  He didn't mind.  It was hilarious.  But do you realize how crazy Mitch Green is?  Mitch Green's a scare.  There's one point where Mike said that Mitch used to rob and fucking strong arm all these  drug dealers in the neighborhood.  You know, Mitch is 6'6".  Oh, they showed that video during the thing.  Yeah.  He was calling. 
[00:34:00]  Here.  This is worth playing.  This is Mitch in 86.  Yeah.  This is around the time he fought Tyson.  To video taunting Tyson.  Yeah.  I want to be some Michelle Cicely Tyson.  He's a homo.  Oh, baby.  Something to do with simulation.  Dog kid ugly.  Tyson ugly.  He a homo.  We want to listen to the national.  Michelle Cicely Tyson is a homo.  Damn it.  A homo.  He's flexing.  Yeah.  He's like his muscles talking. 
[00:34:30]  He could have been a WWE superstar, Mitch Green.  He's fearless, too.  Oh, yeah, he was.  Because Tyson's just going through the story about just beating the shit out of that famous  story of Dapper Dan's in Harlem, that street fight.  And just Mitch wouldn't stay down.  Like, what a tough, crazy fucking dude, man.  Tyson has a lot of stories in him.  I feel like somehow the show could continue with him just, you know, throwing in new stories  and stuff, right?  Without a doubt, there'll be other things.  Dude, you could see it again.  And here's a couple of things I didn't remember from the first one that might have been slightly 
[00:35:00]  different or tuned up a little bit.  Oh, you saw the show already.  That's right.  I did.  I fucking loved it as much the second time.  Nice.  And he could do this again in a year and have...  Throw in a couple little...  Absolutely.  Like Don King's stories would be great.  He talked about Buster and beating the shit out of him, and it was really good, man.  He don't like Don King.  No, he hates him.  He fucking hates Don King and took a stab at Puff Daddy.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It was friendly, though.  Well, back in the day, you know, Tyson had all the money and was throwing the parties, 
[00:35:30]  and he basically is hinting to Puff, and I think he says Puff Daddy.  He says, you know, maybe it's time to return the favor.  Let me party with some of your money now.  Yeah, he beat Mitch Green in the ring.  I think it was a decision, though.  Wasn't it?  Do you know...  Oh, right now he's on Fox and Friends.  So he's across the street.  Yeah, we might get him in here to say hi today.  That'd be cool.  Especially since we saw the show yesterday. 
[00:36:00]  So for us, locally, Westbury Music Fair, he'll be there Sunday, and I'm telling you,  I highly recommend you get a ticket, especially if you know anything about Tyson and you're  into boxing.  It's great.  Yeah, it's well worth it, and there's a lot of...  I want to give away so much more, because it would be so much fun to talk about.  But just say go see it, and then...  Yeah, down the road, maybe we'll talk about it more.  Yeah, because he's got a bunch...  Go to MikeTysonTour.com.  There's a bunch of West Coast dates and stuff.  The people who have it all over the country, he's going out farther with it. 
[00:36:30]  I had a real old couple sitting next to me.  Like, they had to be in their 80s, and the one woman, like, just aggressively was taking  the armrest, and at one point, we're just kind of snuggling together, like, because  I'm trying to squish in my seat, and her old lady arm is up against mine, like...  I hate that.  Like, if you were just...  If you were just...  I'm trying to even think, like, I don't know, in a coffee shop, and there was an old lady  there, you would never snuggle up to them, but because you're in the theater, it's okay 
[00:37:00]  to be, like...  Yeah, you've got to be, like, right on top of them, yeah.  You're basically snuggling with the person next to you, and it's all cool that you're touching  arms the whole show and stuff, but I want to know who they were.  I'm trying to figure it out, because Spike Lee came over to make sure they were sat properly,  and they didn't need anything.  Oh, really?  Oh, was Spike there?  I didn't see...  Maybe it was the Zimmerman parents fucking...  He was paying them back for giving out their address.  See?  I went there.  I didn't see him last night.  He was three feet away from me. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, you said he sat and watched the show?  No, he just made sure this couple that was right next to me was all set up.  I don't know who they were.  They kind of looked familiar, and it's driving me nuts.  Is there any pictures from last night?  I'm sure there are, but there was no red carpet or anything.  They probably were backstage.  There's a picture of Jake LaLotta and Mike Tyson with an adoring fan in between them.  Oh, yes.  Jimmy, they were going backstage.  Really old white couple.  What was the guy wearing?  Oh, God, I don't know.  He wasn't wearing a crazy jacket, though.  I don't know.  Theater clothes. 
[00:38:00]  You know, they were dressed as...  Were they all dressed up?  You know what?  You never know.  It may have been a cousin of Customato's, or it may have been a guy producing...  A silent partner producer.  You know, it might be one of those guys.  And she had that horrendous old lady perfume, the stuff that makes your eyes water.  It smells like raid.  I don't know what the fuck is it.  You know, fucking bug spray.  What is it?  Old lady fucking perfume smells like bug spray.  It's over-the-top flowery.  Ah, terrible.  But it's like the shitty flowers, I guess, you could find.  It's horrible, but for some reason, women get older, and they just love that scent. 
[00:38:30]  It's brutal.  It's the smell of dried-up fucking ovaries.  Old.  How was your weekend, eh?  Oh, I had a...  Let's see.  I had a little birthday party at my house.  Yeah.  For the little kids.  Huh?  Oh, yeah, exactly.  Oh, my God.  Fucking people.  Yeah, Melinda's sister and brother-in-law, two of their kids, it was their birthday, so 
[00:39:00]  they came over, and we had a little birthday party for them and stuff.  And, like, I took a picture and tweeted it, and then 90 fucking tweets back,  Hey, is Uncle Paul there?  Look out for Uncle Paul.  Hey, did you invite Uncle Paul?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  They, it's like, you gotta know, like, by 12, 14 hours after I posted it, that I've heard 
[00:39:30]  the joke.  That I've heard the Uncle Paul joke.  And then, coming in a close second was booger couch jokes.  You throw away your couch?  Look out for boogers.  Hey, is there a booger on the couch?  Better check the couch for boogers.  Where's Uncle Paul?  Well, did Uncle Paul?  Maybe Uncle Paul put a booger on the couch.  Oh, wow.  Look out.  I wish somebody would have said that.  Maybe it would have been a little different.  You could combine the two.  It would have been a little more original.  Yeah.  Oh, they just fucking went on.  But, uh, yes, I had, like, a little party at the house. 
[00:40:00]  And then, um...  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  Did the kids like the dinosaur?  Oh, they fucking loved the dinosaur.  Well, you can't just, uh, skip past that.  They all take pictures with the dinosaur.  They were out of their minds with the dinosaur, right?  I loved the dinosaur.  They were a little disappointed that my pool wasn't open.  The guys are coming today to start work on that.  But, um, yeah, they loved it.  They loved it.  And then, and then, three kids from, like, from, like, next door come over.  They just come over?  Well, there's kids, like, they're playing in the yard and stuff. 
[00:40:30]  Because it was, like, a birthday party, so there's a bunch of fucking kids in the yard.  And then, you know, kids, they could just walk up and go,  Hi, you're my friend.  They're fucking retarded.  They're hanging out.  It's kind of true.  It's fucking hilarious.  You're not my friend.  Yeah.  Hey, you're my friend now.  I met you for fucking two seconds.  Now I get to go into your awesome place.  Hey, we're the same size.  You're my friend.  That's the only criteria you really need.  Are they the neighbor's kids?  Yeah.  So the neighbors have kids.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen them.  Because they usually, I just hear from the other side of the fence, 
[00:41:00]  Mister, can you throw the basketball over?  Yeah.  Yeah, so they were playing.  So then they're having the cake for the kid.  And I noticed, like, there's three kids that I don't recognize.  In your house?  Yeah.  In my house.  And they're fucking, now they're eating cake and stuff.  And then, like, they were there until, like, 1130 at night.  I'm just thinking, where are the fucking parents going?  Where are my kids?  Wait, the parents weren't inside either? 
[00:41:30]  No, we never saw the parents at all.  Because usually they come together in a situation like that.  At some point, you'd think the parents would come over and go, hi, I'm from next door.  Right, right, right.  I saw my kids come in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nothing.  Really?  Not a fucking peep.  How old are the kids?  They were probably maybe 10.  Maybe 10, maybe 9.  Yeah.  And then they're fucking, like, they're running around downstairs blabbing karaoke and then back upstairs.  Then I just walk in.  One kid's, like, got the remote. 
[00:42:00]  He's watching TV.  What the fuck is this?  It's 1130.  You lost control of your house years ago.  No, I lost control of my house, like, this weekend.  That's for sure.  Oh.  I think you lost control a while ago now.  Do you?  Yeah.  You always come in with a good story.  It's fucking crazy.  It's because I don't care, you know.  It's fucking fun and all.  So, yeah, we just, like, hung out.  It was pretty good.  It was a birthday weekend, so it was a little more difficult. 
[00:42:30]  Your birthday weekend.  Yeah, it was.  Did you do anything cool?  Yeah.  No, I hung out, you know.  Hung out pretty much mellow.  Dinner things, you know, shit like that.  But, yeah, it was like...  How did the kids leave?  Did they finally leave on their own, or did the parents finally ring your doorbell?  They finally left on their own.  They just left, like, 1130.  I was outside.  Right.  So, yeah, I didn't see when they left. 
[00:43:00]  But, yeah, like, Jen came over and told me that, like, oh, yeah, they finally left.  I'm like, Jesus.  You'd think the parents would, like...  Now you're friendly.  1130, it's the...  And then we were interrogating the kids.  It was hilarious.  Some of my other guests, like, buddy and stuff.  And, oh, it was Vinny.  Vinny was over.  So he was asking the kids.  He's like, so, do your parents ever talk about the parties that go on here?  Oh, no.  And the kids are like, yeah.  He goes, oh, what do they say?  That you're loud. 
[00:43:30]  And the other kid goes, yeah, one night we heard a lot of cursing.  Wow.  And then he goes, yeah, sometimes my mom and dad, they yell and then have to sleep in  a room on the other side of the house.  Oh, no.  That's great.  That's funny.  I'm like, that's fucking hilarious.  You didn't feel bad?  No.  Fuck them.  You took care of the kids, you mean.  Yeah.  No, wait a minute.  Uncle Paul. 
[00:44:00]  You took care of their kids, though.  Yeah, they were fine.  You can't be too mad anymore.  They had...  Now your pals were your neighbors.  You know that.  Uh, no, I haven't seen the neighbors.  You've never seen their faces?  No, I've talked to them over the fence when I throw the basketball over or something like  that.  Yeah, that's about it.  Is their yard as cool as yours?  No.  Not even close, right?  They got, like, the driveway with the basketball hoop.  Right.  And then they got, like, a small grass area with one of those, um, like, jungle gym type  things on it with the wooden little fucking treehouse-y ladder swing thing. 
[00:44:30]  They got that.  And that's about it.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  The big thrill is when I hover the helicopter over their driveway, and you hear, bring it  lower!  Bring it lower!  No.  You'll hit it with your bat.  Yeah, they just want to throw something out of it.  Yeah, they just want to throw shit out of it.  Watch it crash.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was, uh, that was fun, though.  Did that.  Birthday weekend, uh, I wanted, I wanted to fucking take a little belt.  I want to take a belt. 
[00:45:00]  Did you take a belt?  No.  Wow.  I've been fucking gut.  Went over Joe's, uh, yesterday.  We had a little rot gut, uh, rehearsal.  Mm-hmm.  For our big gig in Jersey on, uh, May 18th.  We're gonna be playing May 18th in, uh...  Where in Jersey?  Where the hell's the name of that place?  Oh, boy.  Well, I don't know.  Look for Joe.  I'll, I'll fuck him.  Yeah, we'll get the plug out.  I'll plug it.  My brother...  We got a couple weeks, we'll plug the shit out of him.  Um, yeah, so it should be fun.  We were doing that at dinner. 
[00:45:30]  We don't want to know about the, uh, I don't know.  I, I feel like it's, it's too personal.  What?  But we are doing a radio show.  Well, we, you talk about anything.  How'd you get past the, uh, wanting to take a belt?  Oh, you just don't.  It's the easiest thing.  But where you're bummed...  Not doing something is the easiest thing, because you just don't do it.  But where you bummed that you didn't do it, or, like, were you feeling like...  Yeah, you know, you see, you watch people, like, have a nice glass of wine.  It's like, ah, that would be nice.  And then you just go, nah, I'll fucking, you know, I'll just suck down some fucking club soda. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  That's Joe probably with the plug.  Yeah, right?  No, but it will be.  I'm kidding.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like, ah, that would be nice, you know.  Ah, well, man.  Go out to dinner, and it's like, ah, I don't know what to order.  Oh, uh, Coke.  Coke.  What is that?  Are people being cool around you, or are they like...  No, they're throwing fucking booze at me.  They are, right?  Oh, no.  Nah.  I don't know, Bill for Anthony for his birthday weekend.  That was, yeah, birthday. 
[00:46:30]  Getting past the birthday weekend is like, ah, you know, because you kind of want to tie one on.  Getting past the summer.  This is your time.  Yeah, yeah.  When that pool opens, this is your time until October.  That's all right.  That's all right.  I'll see if we're, you know, you know, I don't know.  It's the whole ritual thing, too, which is kind of easy to get past, because then you  just need a little club soda and cranberry juice or something like that, a clinky glass  with the fucking ice cubes, and you go clink, clink, clink, and it's like, ah, you just 
[00:47:00]  feel like you've fucking got something.  What was it called?  Near beer when we were growing up?  I hate that shit.  Was it called near beer?  Oh, duels.  Yeah, oh, duels, near beer.  That's crazy.  But at that point, there's so many other things I'd rather drink.  I know.  Oh, well, I got my near beer.  I'm good.  I'm drinking.  I like beer.  I like, you know, drinking a cold beer, but I also like the fact that you get a buzz  from it.  I'm not just going to drink fucking stuff that tastes like beer.  But does, I don't even know.  I mean, does that taste like a good beer?  I've never had an oh, duels. 
[00:47:30]  It's like, why bother when I could just have a real beer?  I remember the bars were trying hard to, you know, stock their joints with some non-alcoholic  beers.  Probably.  Most of those have gone away now.  Yeah, yeah.  It just wasn't working.  No.  People went to other things, like, you know, you just go for a drink that doesn't have  booze in it.  Right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  How are you doing with all that?  It continues.  No, no.  It's fucking...  Is it weird?  No, not really.  Just don't think about it.  You know?  No, but that's why I keep asking questions, because that's really amazing to me, because  it's not that easy for a lot of people.  They do think about it constantly, and that itch, like, drives them nuts, wanting to have  the belt.  The more you just tell yourself no, the more it doesn't bother you, because you're just  kind of...  You're just not doing it. 
[00:48:30]  And you did the same thing years ago with smoking.  Yeah.  That's why I'm amazed by this.  You were a heavy smoker when I first met you.  Yeah.  You were smoking pretty much every day.  I don't even remember...  I loved smoking.  I couldn't even tell you the last...  I couldn't even tell you the year you quit.  It's been so long.  I know.  I loved smoking.  What year was it?  Like, the NEW days, right?  It was, like, 10 years ago.  It was after.  It was, I think, 2002, 2003.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  So, 2002.  But the same thing, man.  You, like, one day said, that's it.  You just stopped.  And I didn't believe you at the time.  Like, there's no way... 
[00:49:00]  There's no way someone just goes, that's it, to a habit.  And you did, man.  Yeah, you just fucking...  I don't know.  I've always been like that.  Just, all right, forget it.  I'm done with it.  Fuck it.  Oh, yeah, you did that with a few other things.  My marriage.  I was there for that day, too.  Like, wow, that's how it just...  Like, that?  It's over.  Gone.  Goodbye.  I tell a story, and it really is the truth.  There was a point.  You basically threw a coin. 
[00:49:30]  I was...  It was an amazing day, hanging out with you.  Yeah.  You were looking at me.  You were kind of talking to yourself.  I don't think you were asking for my advice at that point.  And I remember your head just going, should I...  And you're looking at this car that has a lawyer's phone number.  Yeah.  And I saw it.  Like, your desk was right next to me back then at NAW.  And I saw the thought process.  And I was just sitting there staring at you going, this is amazing.  It's a toying cause, right?  A toying cause, yeah. 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  A coin toss.  Sorry.  A coin toss right now.  And you went...  And I remember, and I know this is exactly what you said.  You went, ah, fuck it.  Fuck it.  And you picked up the phone to call.  I do believe that would be your lawyer.  That's a fucking life crossroad right there.  But you could easily...  That's not a life crossroad.  Let me go this way.  But you could easily say, ah, let me...  I'm not happy, but it's easier to maybe stay married for now.  Let me give it a shot.  But you went, hmm, what should I do?  Fuck.  I heard so many people like, hey, it's cheaper to keep her. 
[00:50:30]  Cheaper to keep her.  It's like, yeah, I'm going to base my whole fucking rest of my life on a rhyme.  The fact that something rhymes.  Fuck you.  Get lost.  Take a hike.  Yeah.  Oh, good for you, man.  Do you regret being divorced?  Oh, no.  Oh, do I fuck it.  I wish I would have done it earlier.  I really do.  That fucking...  Yuck.  Yuck. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  I think it's time to take a break, get some food in us.  We have Anthony Bourdain coming in today.  Very cool.  Oh, right.  What time's the year?  He's coming in around 8.  Oh, cool.  And then...  He's not scheduled, but we're hoping Tyson comes in and says hi today.  We've had him on a couple times.  He's a great guest.  The first time he was on was one of the best appearances anyone has ever had.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we got the mellow one the second time.  Which was mellow, Mike.  Which was pretty good, too.  Yeah.  So, hopefully he'll stop by. 
[00:51:30]  I'm going to ask some questions.  Like, what, you want to box us something?  You're going to box us something?  Yeah.  I just want to say, you know, can we all get along?  Can we get along?  Um, can we stop making it horrible for the older people and the kids?  Police coming straight from the underground.  A young nigga got it bad because I'm brown. 
[00:52:00]  And not the other color, so police think.  They have the authority to kill a minority.  21 years ago today, huh?  Rodney King riots began.  Wow.  Yeah.  I watched some clips recently of the old riots.  That was crazy.  The Asian store owners running around just blasting guns into this tree.  You forget about that shit.  How many people died during those?  That's a good question.  I don't know.  Yeah.  They were fucking burning stores down and looting. 
[00:52:30]  And a couple of these Asian guys just come out with pistols.  And they're just leveling their guns and firing at people in the street.  It's crazy.  Wow.  Yeah.  They didn't want anyone messing with their shit.  Yeah, nah.  With their rice cakes.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I remember being on Long Island.  I think I was working at BAB at the time.  21 years ago.  Yeah.  Right before I met Ann.  And I remember Long Island was scared.  Like the riots were coming. 
[00:53:00]  Do you remember that?  Yeah.  Everybody was like, uh-oh.  There was fear in the air.  Come the riots.  They're starting in Los Angeles.  They're moving east, man.  It's just a matter of time.  Mm-hmm.  I didn't get much action on Long Island.  Nah.  Not really.  Nah, not suburbia.  And then they set up the big police line in Beverly Hills.  They're like, oh, we ain't going to let them in here.  That's nice.  We ain't going to let them in here.  Let them burn down there, you know.  Protecting the one percenters.  Crenshaw. 
[00:53:30]  Crenshaw.  Motherfucking Crenshaw, man.  That was 21 years.  21.  Damn.  I actually thought it was longer.  Seems longer, right?  Seems longer, yeah.  53 dead.  How many?  53 dead.  2,000 plus injured.  53 dead, 2,000 plus injured.  Holy shit.  Wow, that's a hell of a riot.  Because of the old Rodney King.  Did you ever used to get, like, were there ever rumors when you were growing up that gangs 
[00:54:00]  were coming during Halloween?  Oh, yeah.  They used to always tell us, like, the bloods are supposed to be coming to New Rochelle this  Halloween.  New Rochelle.  And be panicked.  They always have those rumors that, like, if you see somebody flashes their high beams  or if you flash your high beams at somebody without their lights on, they turn around  and kill you.  Well, yeah.  Really?  Did you hear about that?  Yeah.  They just wait for the one person that's...  Yeah, people would drive around with their headlights off, like at dusk, you know? 
[00:54:30]  So that's a gang guy.  And then people...  Yeah.  Gang guys.  They're like...  Just waiting for one asshole to go, hey, you're...  And someone goes, hey, click, click.  And it's like, all right, that's the fucker.  We killed it.  Oh, my God.  Is that real?  Gang, gang, gang.  Was that ever real?  No.  I don't know.  Enough people heard about it that it became real.  It's absolutely fake.  Of course.  It never happened.  Jeez.  But, like, we all had to make sure we had no red in our Halloween costumes.  That...  Well, that's gotten people killed in gang areas where you're wearing the wrong colors. 
[00:55:00]  But not in New Rochelle.  Not in New Rochelle.  No.  No one.  Unless the colors don't go together.  Right.  You know?  Right.  Unless they clash.  The fashion police.  Yes, yes.  The gang, the fashion gang.  I haven't worn red in 20 years.  Yeah, right?  I still get scared to wear red.  Yeah.  Hell no.  Blood color, yo.  Yeah.  There are people, though, that have been killed just walking around.  It's like, oh, he's wearing fucking, you know, red.  There have been people that have been killed for saying cuz. 
[00:55:30]  Huh?  Hmm?  Really?  Cuz is what you call...  The Crips call each other cuz.  But everyone says that now.  Yo, cuz.  Yeah, not back then.  And the blood say, what up, blood?  And then you say, what up, cuz?  Well, I got, like, 20-something cousins.  What am I supposed to do?  Yeah.  I'm in the wrong hood, and you're like, hey.  I walk around saying cuz all the time.  Yo, cuz.  Which way is north?  I say partner.  Yeah, partner?  That's okay.  Hey, partner.  That's neutral.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That'll get your ass kicked.  Partner?  And menace to society.  Ain't no partners here. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, partner.  That guy got fucked up.  Sam, I forgot to ask you what you thought of the Tyson one-man show.  Sam went?  Yeah, it was great.  Well.  I love you just sitting there, talking about doing blow.  He's just talking about how bad his drug problems were.  Yeah.  But, uh...  Up until, like, 2006?  I think he said he's got, like, four years down.  2006, he had his cocaine bust.  I was very candid.  I thought there was a lot that he probably couldn't save because of legal stuff. 
[00:56:30]  Like, I'll bet so much of that Don King stuff is all sort of unknown legal that he would actually...  I have a feeling he's got some real people around him right now going, all right, we're going to get some of this fucking money back.  So, we think you should just say, fuck Don King, and that's it for now.  $8,000 a week for towels.  Don fucking King.  Maybe they were really good towels. 
[00:57:00]  It's hilarious how animated he is on stage, though.  He's, like, booty dancing on stage at one point.  It was really...  It was very funny to see him be silly.  Yeah, he was very silly.  Yeah.  If it's not what you'd kind of expect.  Because I think that he had to learn to be silly.  I don't think that his nature...  I don't know about that.  I don't agree.  Or you think it's, like, when he was young...  I think he had to have this persona.  And, you know, he finally is just saying, fuck that, this is the real me.  Like, he always wanted to be silly.  Yeah, I do get silly at times and whatnot. 
[00:57:30]  I think.  Afraid of splitting his pants.  Yeah.  Yeah, he wanted to do a round...  We're giving out too much shit.  That's why it was...  He wanted to give a roundhouse kick, but he had tight, white, like, leather pants on.  I split in my pants.  And he goes, I don't want to split my pants.  And then he did the roundhouse, which was extremely lame.  Well, I love it.  But then he makes a joke, like, look, you know, I know there's a few of you out there  that have seen the show before.  I kicked a lot higher last time, right?  It's just really funny, man. 
[00:58:00]  A couple of idiots were, like, heckling him a little bit.  Yeah.  They just yell, we love you, Mike.  And he just, like, stopped.  And he was like, I'm trying to work up here.  Let me work.  Please, let me do this.  Let me do this right now.  Go into the crowd and fucking pummel one person.  Yeah.  Every show, you should just beat the shit out of somebody.  Another guy, he was like, I kind of like, I like to do it by myself when I'm up here.  I like to do this on my own.  I was amazed that people were yelling.  But they weren't heckling to be nasty.  But they just wanted to say something.  They wanted to have a moment where he heard them. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They can help themselves.  Yeah.  In a weird way, I don't blame them.  You're looking at Mike Tyson.  You're like, holy fuck, Mike Tyson.  And every time he shadowboxed here and there, he does that.  The place just lost their mind.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's some of my favorite footage during the thing.  There's a song they play, which I like.  I don't know the song.  But they show footage.  And I asked him about it the first time he was in, of a very young Tyson.  And I want to say Kevin Rooney was with him.  And he's just in black and white, like shadowboxing in the ring. 
[00:59:00]  And you see how fucking fast this guy was.  It literally looks like they sped the footage up, which you know they didn't.  That's just how he punched.  And I love UFC so much.  But you forget when a guy is a boxer like that good, how devastating he is.  And they showed a picture of him.  And it was a big screen.  Basically, the show is Tyson talking about his life.  And there's a huge screen behind him with pictures that he kind of plays off a little bit.  And they showed a picture of him.  And he turned and went, yeah, I'm 15 right there. 
[00:59:30]  And the place was completely shocked.  You thought you were looking at it like a 22-year-old man.  He was 15, just completely ripped at 15 years old.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah, Cuss really took care of him.  Yeah.  Cussed him on him.  He wasn't in his life that long, right?  No.  Four or five years, maybe?  No.  Not even?  Younger.  No, more.  More.  Because he was 14.  13 or 14, he started taking him out and teaching him to fight.  And when the...  Tyson was 20 when he died in the championship. 
[01:00:00]  But when...  How old was Tyson when Cuss died?  I think he was right before...  Can you check that?  What year did Cuss tomorrow die?  I want to say it was right before.  I don't know how much.  Right before the championship.  So it was probably five or six years.  So that's five or six years, probably, yeah.  He died in 85.  85.  Tyson would have been...  63.  Was it?  Tyson was born in 66.  Oh, you're right.  So 19, maybe going...  You know, maybe heading toward 20 when Cuss died.  So like five years?  Yeah.  Well, six or seven years. 
[01:00:30]  No.  Should 13...  Well, yeah, six years.  I'm going four or five.  I'm going five or six.  That means you would have met him at 13.  So Jim said 13 or 14.  Oh.  Yeah.  14.  When he was taking him out fighting...  Or 13.  He was 14, Tyson said.  14, just beating the shit out of everybody.  At 14.  And the pigeons, too, when he was a kid.  Right.  He's always loved the pigeons.  Oh, yeah.  He has pigeons, right?  Yeah, he loves pigeons.  Like set him down the road of fighting.  Who likes pigeons? 
[01:01:00]  A lot of people like pigeons.  Yeah, man.  It's a weird...  Yeah.  Yeah, I think people who have really weird social skills like pigeons.  Like for some reason...  You know, I don't mind pigeons.  But that's where I just stop.  But I think you could get a pigeon in your backyard next to your dinosaur.  Oh, no.  I don't want fucking birds.  I don't want no birds.  I had a bird that nested like right under the overhang.  Right.  Kind of by my back door.  That's nice when that happens.  No, it's not.  You check on the little fella every morning and see if it's laying eggs. 
[01:01:30]  Really?  Yeah, I like that stuff.  Here's what happened.  What happened?  Here's what happened.  It did lay eggs.  Yeah.  It laid eggs up on top of one of the little columns that hold up the overhang.  And every time I walked out, it would dive bomb my head because it was defending its fucking shit.  So it would come like fucking fluttering.  And I'd be like, ah!  I got my hands over my head.  I'm running around like a maniac in my own yard.  In your own yard. 
[01:02:00]  Were you crying because the bird was picking on you?  Yes.  I was pissy eyed.  Leave me alone.  So I had a bunch of tiles from the pool that were left over.  Yeah.  They're like one by one tiles.  So I just took them and I threw them up on top of the nest and just covered the nest in these tiles.  Jesus, Ed.  What an asshole.  Fuck that.  What was I supposed to do?  Relocate it?  What am I?  Green piece?  Get the fuck out of my yard.  Probably could have called someone for that.  No. 
[01:02:30]  No.  So the thing kept flying over my head for like the next two days or so.  Then I didn't see the bird anymore because it realized I had killed its little babies and it could leave now.  But a bird probably, by the time it crossed into the next yard, forgot all about it.  Yeah, they don't care.  I don't know.  I don't.  It's like they're crying.  Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep.  They don't call them bird brains for nothing.  Yeah, bird brain.  A little bird brain.  So they flew over the fence.  They had no recollection that they were. 
[01:03:00]  Didn't even think about it.  Expecting an expecting parent.  Now if they had hatched and been like going, peep, peep, peep, peep, then I couldn't have done anything.  Oh, that would have been rough.  Because that's crazy.  But when they're just eggs.  That's cereal killer shit.  I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  Then I covered them up with them tiles and that was it.  Bye bye birdie.  Tyson said he loved, the only thing he loved more than stealing was his pigeons.  He's robbing people and taking care of pigeons.  Oh my god.  He was arrested 28 times. 
[01:03:30]  How was he arrested 28 times and not in jail?  By the time he was 13 or something like that?  Well, in that neighborhood, man, that's probably very common.  You probably have to do so many more horrible things to really stay in jail.  And that's how you keep it common.  That's how you keep it a commonplace thing in that neighborhood.  Oh boy.  Unbelievable.  Well, he knew if he wanted anything, he wasn't going to get it.  So he had to take it.  Yeah.  And so he did.  Maybe you can't have everything and you work toward things and finally get them.  I don't know.  When you're Mike Tyson. 
[01:04:00]  Can you just enjoy the story?  No, I can't.  I can't.  He beat incredible odds.  There's a cultural aspect to it that I fucking despise.  Socioramifications of it all?  Exactly.  Well, good for him.  He did transcend to rape.  He should have been dead.  He didn't rape.  He should have been dead.  I mean, growing up in that fucking world, man, that's a brutal place.  Fucking.  Everyone's got a pistol and, you know, if you say the wrong thing to the wrong guy, you  get shot.  It's just an awful place. 
[01:04:30]  He showed a picture of, you know, where he grew up in Brownsville.  That was really funny.  Yeah.  How much nicer it is now that white people moved in.  And he goes, look, you know, you think this, you know, we got this footage from years  ago.  Spike Lee went out like two weeks ago to get this footage and then explained all the shit  that's missing from this really nice picture.  I'm telling you, man, really funny show.  Westbury Music Affair for the New Yorkers or Long Island.  Yeah, you should see it.  I think you'd enjoy it.  It's Sunday.  Yeah.  Then we could talk about it more next Monday.  Man, I would almost go again. 
[01:05:00]  It's amazing.  It's Tyson is up on stage and he's telling these stories that are so candid and everything.  It's just you feel familiar with him.  Right.  Like, even though you're watching him on stage, you're like, yeah, Mike's telling me stories.  Isn't that odd that he's like, after everything he's gone through and done and the insanity  that he would put out there, people just want to like him.  Yeah.  Like he, there are other people you like, they just go away because people don't want  to like him, you know? 
[01:05:30]  But even with everything he's done and all the shit he's done in the news.  This is the guy who said he takes his medication to keep me from killing y'all.  From killing y'all.  I'm going to eat your children.  I'm going to fuck you till you love me.  Till you love me.  The biting the ear off, the rape allegation, the this, the that.  But you're still just like, how do you not like the guy?  Well, he does explain at one point he was the number one hated man in America.  Yeah.  He said, I didn't mind being in the top ten, but there was a point where he was number  one.  After biting the ear, I think.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  And he turned everybody around.  He's a charismatic guy.  What started the turnaround, do you think?  Hangover?  I don't know.  It was before that.  That was a part of it.  You know what?  It wasn't before that, but that was part of it.  I think it was, I think it was, like.  Well, he did the, uh, Tallback, uh, Tallback?  James Toback.  Toback.  James Toback film before that, right?  But I think it was also.  I think that started turning people around.  I agree.  The legend just started growing.  Like, he wasn't doing as much active stuff, so people just weren't so occupied with what's  going on right now, and more like Mike Tyson is this larger-than-life dude that says ridiculous 
[01:06:30]  shit, and became like, oh my god, this is hilarious.  Yeah.  And they did the documentary and the hangover.  But he hasn't been champion since 1990.  And he was champion for a short period of time when you look at, like, how long Larry  Holmes held it, or, or Ali, you know, there's something about him that people love.  And I don't know, like, I asked, I was wondering myself, like, why do I love Mike Tyson so much?  Because I really do.  I've always liked him since I was, my first time I saw him was a cover of fucking Sports  Illustrated when I was in rehab. 
[01:07:00]  Kid Dynamite, I think is what it said on the cover.  That was the first time I ever heard of Mike Tyson.  He was 18, or he was 20, whoever he was.  But I don't know what it is about this guy that I like so much.  I don't know.  Can he?  Can't always figure out why you connect to somebody, or not, not relate to them, but what  is it about you, them that makes you a fan, or makes you dig them?  I don't know.  Because he was so awesome at what he did.  Maybe, yeah.  And he had that charisma.  Like, a lot of these boxers that are really good are not nearly as charismatic.  Right.  You know, it's the same reason people love or hate Chael Sonnen. 
[01:07:30]  Like, he keeps losing fights, but he talks.  And you're like, I gotta watch this guy fight, you know?  I think when you're the best at your sport, you just, there's something about that.  I used to be a huge Knicks fan, but I fucking loved Michael Jordan.  Every fucking time.  Yeah.  I almost rooted for him against my own fucking team.  He was, because he was that much better than everybody.  But he also had that whole, except for a couple of things, had that, you know, good guy, very  wholesome commercials and stuff. 
[01:08:00]  So, he wasn't beating the shit out of people and fucking, you know.  Well, there was always a weird innocence with Mike Tyson, though.  You kind of felt that.  Like, you almost felt bad for the guy.  Yeah, maybe that was it.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  He couldn't really hide that innocence in the end.  I think it felt, too, like, you knew you were seeing, like, really, real greatness.  And I think, like, after, especially, he got hooked up with Don King, you kept waiting 
[01:08:30]  for this greatness to return.  This, like, you knew the potential you were seeing was one of the best, if not the best  ever.  Right.  At one point.  And then when you see him with a guy like Don King, you're like, fuck, you're watching  this thing slip away.  Right.  This thing, this potential to be the greatest ever slip away, being tied up with the wrong  person.  Right.  And you knew it was, like, getting tied up with the wrong person or stuff that was going  on outside the sport.  Yeah, and stuff he was even doing.  Yeah, sure.  But it wasn't like he got in the ring and didn't live up to his potential. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, no.  It was all outside stuff.  It was so much stuff outside of it that you're like, I just wish, you kept feeling like you're  watching what could have been after a while.  At first, it was, this is what he does.  He's fucking phenomenal.  He just beat the shit out of everybody in the first round.  Everybody got beaten up.  Wasted a lot of pay-per-view money.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, this is great.  We're all, you know, partying at the house.  And then, oh, it's over.  That's great.  That was fun.  People started to get pissed at him, too, for ending those fights so quickly. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  He's paying $60.  You know, we mentioned Michael Jordan, and he got married over the weekend.  Yeah.  What an asshole.  You know he's got to try a good prenup.  But Jordan's...  It doesn't matter at this point.  I think Jordan's 50-ish, and I think his new bride's about 37, they said, or something.  35.  35.  Got married again, even though his divorce cost him.  This just...  I mean...  When are they going to figure this shit out, that the guys get completely screwed in divorces? 
[01:10:00]  How much is the question?  168 million.  Holy shit.  I bet you it's more than that.  Oh.  Yeah.  168 million dollars for a woman.  You know what?  I'm not a fan of, like, even when, you know, a marriage breaks up, like, throwing your wife  out on the street and hopes she's homeless.  I'm not like that at all.  Yeah.  But there's a...  It goes on.  But there's a point where it's fair, and then it's ridiculous. 
[01:10:30]  Do you realize the 8 million part of 168 million is a lot of fucking money?  The what?  The 8 part in 168 million is a fuckload of money.  And that's just the 8.  Right.  168 million.  168 million.  It's crazy.  It cost Jordan to get divorced.  That's so secondary.  Sheeper to keeper.  Rhymey fuck.  But how is that fair?  It's not. 
[01:11:00]  It's sickening.  The guys get screwed left and right, you know, that obviously aren't in the Michael Jordan  category.  Where it really fucking hurts.  At least Michael Jordan, you know, he's probably worth, like, fuck, I don't know.  I guess, I would guess close to a billion at this point, right?  Yeah.  If not over a billion.  He's built an empire.  So in the end, he could afford it.  But still, what the fuck?  Even if you could afford 168 million, you sure as shit don't want to fucking part with  it.  Of course not.  Man, that's a lot of million. 
[01:11:30]  No one has ever said, well, thank God that was only 168 million.  Not anything.  That's a lot of anything.  168 million is a lot.  That's crazy.  That's fucking nuts.  That's just not fair.  I'll blow you my nose.  I'll be right back.  Get a good one.  I'm tired today.  Yeah.  Feels like a Monday.  Yeah.  I was out and about late last night.  Too much Mike Tyson excitement. 
[01:12:00]  I went to Bob's after because Bobby Kelly came with me and his wife.  Oh, I thought of you.  When do you sleep?  When I get home.  Like, I want to go backstage and hang with Tyson for a few minutes.  I'm like, no, man.  Every minute I'm wasting, you know, back's not wasting, but it would have been great.  I could be in bed.  I don't mind.  Yeah, but you know what?  I weigh the options.  I don't know how you do it.  Because I'd like this.  Am I going to be a few minutes more tired the next day?  How often do I get a chance?  It's not going to be a long night.  It's not like we're going to, you know, we're going out to the Hamptons.  When's the next time I get the chance to be backstage with Mike Tyson? 
[01:12:30]  It's like it's very rare, so it's like I enjoy it.  I get that part, but what you said in there was,  and then I went over to Bob Kelly's.  I'm like, what?  I ate dinner.  I was starving.  All I had eaten yesterday was I had a little bit of a lunch, took a long nap.  Like, I had a small bag of pretzels because the bacon doesn't have anything that you can eat.  Right.  And then Bobby's wife made fucking pasta-less lasagna.  The vegetable lasagna that you guys said you didn't like with, like, a low-fat cheese. 
[01:13:00]  It was awesome.  I was expecting to hate it, but it was fucking amazing.  Sounds good, actually.  Yeah, so I was happy I did that.  I went and had a nice dinner.  I was really hungry.  Right.  Man, man.  Wait, you thought about me because of lasagna?  Didn't you say you didn't like fucking lasagna?  I thought it was great.  Pasta-less lasagna?  It was great.  Yeah, it was all vegetable lasagna.  What's the layers made out of?  She told me it was just different, just some different vegetables, but it didn't taste, it tasted just like lasagna.  Yeah.  And the cheese was really low-fat. 
[01:13:30]  They usually throw, like, some peppers in there and some eggplant.  Yeah.  Eggplant and...  Eggplant was one of them, right?  Yeah.  That type of thing.  But that fucking low-fat cheese didn't give...  I mean, you know, again, regular lasagna's better, but this was damn good.  Well, we got...  Of course, regular lasagna's better.  But not so much better that it was worth eating.  I didn't want to eat regular lasagna.  We got a really hot mother that was abducted, huh?  What the hell is that?  Jessica...  Abducted.  Why is he abducted in quotes?  Because they're not sure. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah?  Missing mother abducted.  Jessica Herringer.  Herringer.  Suspect of the man 30s to 40s in silver minivan.  Man, yeah, she's pretty good looking.  That's a tricky situation, because now the guy...  That's a very tricky situation.  Now the guy in the silver minivan's like, well, fuck.  They just announced that I'm in a silver minivan.  Yeah.  But they announced that hoping they could find the silver minivan. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's kind of like a catch-22.  Yeah.  Well, even if he ditches it, you need to get evidence from it.  True.  Perhaps.  Abduction.  Definitely white guy crime.  That's being said here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of...  Hey, what's going on with the engine from 9-11?  They found it in between...  It's a landing gear.  You know, it was first report it was an engine.  Really?  It absolutely was.  Yeah, it's a... 
[01:15:00]  You're right, though.  It is a landing gear.  A landing gear.  I thought they reported it as part of the engine, they said, at first.  Yeah, landing gear.  They're going to pull it out of there and then check all the surrounding area for body parts.  Some DNA that they might be able to check off the list.  Isn't it amazing that this thing is in between buildings like that?  Yeah.  I would think they would have checked every nook and cranny down there for sure.  Yeah.  A lot of little spaces that just don't get looked at for fucking 12 years. 
[01:15:30]  Wow.  Amazing.  And what?  Somebody went back there to do some work?  Yeah.  But isn't it a little, like, tight little space?  Yeah.  It's like those little spaces you see between buildings.  Right, right.  Sometimes buildings are built, like, you know, two feet apart from each other.  Yeah, you can put your arms out and pretty much touch the two buildings.  What were they doing back there that they found the landing gear?  I think they were surveying for something.  You know, they're kind of taking a peek around if they're going to do some renovation or new construction or demolition. 
[01:16:00]  But I heard on the news this morning that they, I guess, there's a rope tied around the landing gear.  So they're speculating that perhaps it was lowered down there at some point where it might have been on the roof or it might have been somewhere else.  And, you know, someone was getting rid of it for some reason.  Sure.  And they left the rope on it because that's what you do in a conspiracy.  You leave the rope wrapped around it.  Well, that's obviously going to be a, ah.  But they're saying there is a rope around it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, I mean, it could have been construction guys thinking it was just something else and said, well, we've got to get this thing off the fucking roof. 
[01:16:30]  Not thinking it was a 9-11 thing.  Yeah, and then just lower it down.  No.  Let me see, Sam.  Here's the people who created 9-11 and orchestrated it.  Sure.  But forgot to untie the rope.  Yeah, they forgot.  Wow.  Wait for the conspiracy guys to get a hold of this and go with the whole rope thing.  Ah.  But, yeah, why wouldn't you remove the rope?  Yeah.  Because then that makes it kind of dumb.  But it has the, that part actually had the serial numbers on it and all kinds of information about the plane. 
[01:17:00]  So, very convenient that it matches so nicely to the planes that were supposedly used.  Well, they say they can't connect.  That lets you know where it was made and stuff, but it can't actually connect to the, it won't tie into, yeah.  It won't tie into what plane it was on.  I would assume it's probably one of the two.  Yeah.  That's a tight spot, man.  It is.  The guy could barely get through that crawl space or whatever you want to call it in between the buildings. 
[01:17:30]  Man.  Yeah, so they might find, you know, might find some, uh, some victims.  Give some closure to the families.  Some closure.  What is it, 40% of the people?  They found.  Not found.  Oh, not found.  I think 40% not found.  Not a trace.  Nothing.  Not a speck.  That's crazy.  It's fucking crazy.  That's fucked up.  Just the sheer power of what happened that day. 
[01:18:00]  Boo.  Goodbye.  Just vaporized.  That's fucked up right there.  Mm.  Mm.  That would suck being on the plane.  It's like, you're just shredded.  Yeah, it'd be better.  I think you're just shredded.  That's the way you want to go.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  Yeah, well, you don't want to be up there in the fire and have to jump and jump.  Remember how horrendous all that footage was?  Ah, terrible.  The plane was definitely, before you even really knew what was going on.  Yeah, you'd just be like.  That was fucking fast. 
[01:18:30]  The plane just disappeared.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  And we haven't talked about it in a while.  The reason they jumped was the heat got to them.  Yeah.  To the point where they're, in their heads, logically, that made sense.  Yeah.  To fucking jump.  It's like, well, can't stay there.  You should have something.  Remember them hanging out the window trying to stay, like, you know, comfortable or cool.  And then they finally couldn't take the heat anymore.  That's why those people were jumping.  That's one of the worst pieces of footage is that banker or whoever he was, or he was  this office guy trying to climb.  There's that moment. 
[01:19:00]  Like, sometimes if you stand at these windows, because these windows kind of feel like the  same long, narrow windows the Trade Center have.  And you look outside at, like, what's between the windows, the concrete or whatever.  And you, like, imagine trying to hold on to that.  Do that on the next break.  Like, I looked out there.  Imagine trying to hold on to that and shimmy down.  You'd make it a foot and fall.  Right.  And that's the, this footage of a guy falling off, like, the 92nd floor.  Oh, it's just.  Is he okay?  No, he didn't do well.  Oh.  It's terrible.  I figured I'd ask for the listeners.  But watching him flail, like, in just. 
[01:19:30]  Trying to hold on to the last minute.  Oh, fuck, man.  Yeah, it's pretty awful.  The praying you must be doing, the fucking.  How'd that work out for you?  The fucking, whatever it is that you go through in your mind, it's.  Eek.  Ugh, terrible.  And that's a long way down.  12 seconds about or something?  You got a few seconds to think about it.  Yeah, me definitely do.  Be like, oh, yeah, this is great.  But imagine how long 12 seconds feels like.  Of falling.  Yeah, yeah.  And free fall. 
[01:20:00]  12 seconds of having sex with a crazy attractive woman.  Yeah.  Probably goes pretty quickly.  It's two Vine videos.  Yeah, yeah.  12 seconds of plummeting.  I could ask Jimmy.  Sure.  Every day he gets stuff.  Today it's strawberries and trash bags.  Why?  I'm a serial killer.  He didn't have blueberries.  So I said, there's no blueberries.  Get me black garbage bags.  No, I'll tell you what it is.  I have.  AIDS?  Well, I could have had. 
[01:20:30]  I said, I'm going to get rid of a bunch of clothes today that don't fit anymore.  I'm giving them to Goodwill.  So Kenny said, do you have garbage bags?  So I'll either do it today or tomorrow.  Oh.  Good luck trying to find Goodwill in the city, by the way.  Well, Kenny will do it in Jersey for me because I'm going to give him the bags.  For some reason, they don't want clothes in this city.  Taking your clothes to Jersey?  Maybe.  Nice outfit, Lou.  We try to dump clothes at the local churches.  They don't want them. 
[01:21:00]  Really?  How does a church say no to clothes?  And they're not shitty clothes.  They probably don't want bed bugs or whatever could come with the clothes either.  Maybe.  Or lice.  How about you figure out a system?  You're a church for Christ's sake.  For Christ's sake.  You should be taking free stuff constantly.  Literally.  Right.  Can you see this pile?  Hold on.  All right.  What are you looking at?  This pile of clothes that doesn't fit me anymore.  I fucking...  Look at all those pants.  Wow.  And fucking...  And shirts. 
[01:21:30]  You're nicely folded.  I did that so I could take a picture of it.  I can't believe how many clothes I'm getting rid of today.  That's weird.  I did the same thing.  These are all pants that are falling down.  I got rid of a shitload of clothes.  Spring cleanup.  It's like 15 pairs of nice jeans I'm getting rid of and like 30 shirts.  I have almost no clothes to wear at home.  I got to get new clothes.  Say clothes again.  Clothes.  I kept saying it.  I can get some clothes.  Yeah.  That's old school.  That is old school. 
[01:22:00]  You can't put the goodwill outside in New York City.  No.  Homeless people would just shit and piss all over it.  They shit, piss, and then live in it.  They live in common.  They would probably take a few.  Yeah, but they're not like...  You have the best expectations, but they just end up shitting and pissing on stuff.  Yeah.  In the suburbs, you could have piles of clothes in that thing.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter, huh?  Nobody's walking around shitting and pissing on stuff.  That's a very, very, very good point.  A little, uh, social studies for you. 
[01:22:30]  Well, Anthony Bourdain should be here any moment, so...  Yeah?  We probably should break.  Clear the field for Mr. Bourdain.  Clear the field.  He's doing his, uh, Parts Unknown, Sundays at 9 on CNN.  He's been a great guest over the last couple of years.  I'm going to make everybody laugh when he comes in and go, hey, if someone says get lost,  do you go, yeah, I already did.  That's what I'm doing here.  What?  Walker, you didn't get it.  I got it.  So stupid. 
[01:23:00]  Chip.  Chip Friday was just infuriating.  Oh, my God.  Just trying to, trying to fucking just get in on every joke.  And stealing everybody's, like, saying the same joke.  Every time there was a big laugh.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, yeah.  There was a big laugh.  It would just be cut off.  Wait, wait, wait.  And because she's, and he'd say the same joke.  That was so fucking bad. 
[01:23:30]  He wrecked everything.  Oh, just ruined everything.  I heard one when I was driving from the replay.  It was fucking hilarious.  It was such a fucking asshole.  Just stopped the laughs dead in its tracks.  It's just because he's a dick who wants to take credit for the laugh.  Yes, exactly.  He hears people laughing and he wants it to be about himself.  Yeah, yeah.  Moron.  Chip.  Yeah.  Take a little break. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, Bourdain next and maybe later today, Tyson's stopping by just to say hi.  I guess this is Anthony Bourdain's walking music.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:24:30]  It kind of goes together.  You listen to this song and you see Anthony Bourdain walk down the hall.  He's a tall gent.  He is.  Yeah.  Here he comes.  There he is.  Anthony Bourdain.  Hey, guys.  How are you, man?  Take a seat, sir.  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  Looking good.  How are you, man?  Hey, look at Jimmy Wright.  Isn't he looking good?  He lost 30 pounds, Anthony Bourdain.  Swim and trim.  Like a Greek god.  He's all svelte.  Went to see you on buses all week. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, I know.  It's kind of creepy.  It's nice, though.  It's weirding on my daughter, too.  You know, she's like, Daddy, you're, you know.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Everywhere she goes, there's your face, and it's just kind of odd.  It's bad.  It's too much of that shit.  You start talking about yourself in the third person.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's never a good thing.  The show getting a lot of heat.  Doing really well.  A lot of heat.  And having fun.  I mean, they've been so awesomely.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  I mean, look, their standards and practices have come a long way.  You know, I got to say prolapsed butthole on CNN.  Nice.  Doing pretty strong.  Nice.  And, of course, the ATV footage was everywhere.  Yeah, that hurt.  Yeah, huh?  Bad luck on ATVs.  Yeah, yeah, that's like, what, your second run-in?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I don't know what I was thinking.  Yeah, I was watching, and I'm like, you're going really fast, first of all. 
[01:26:00]  Right.  And going through water and everything, which to me seems, you know, that's that unknown factor.  I've been out in the sun for like four hours to get these shots, and I'm cooking.  I mean, it's really hot.  The sun's coming down.  I'm dehydrated.  I'm drinking beer.  Where was this?  This was in a remote area of Colombia along the Venezuelan border.  And, yeah, I took a tight turn and went over, and I mean, I just sort of drove my skull right  into the ground.  I mean, my crew tells me I ran over my head. 
[01:26:30]  I didn't, I wasn't awake for that.  But I remember I just felt so stupid that I was like, I got to get up and appear like  nothing happened.  Right.  I really don't want to hear the I told you so's.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the first thing people normally do is like, all right, let me get up and make it  seem like nothing happened.  Right.  I'll just, you know, ah, yeah, no, no, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  And then meanwhile, you know, you're not fine.  God, I'm fine.  You know, pardon me while I...  What was the injury?  What was the injury?  Was it a concussion?  I was out for a second, but, you know. 
[01:27:00]  Holy fuck.  Yeah, you got thrown.  I hate that feeling.  That just...  It's that fast, violent, you know, something's not right thing.  You're having control, right?  You're not quite...  You haven't quite figured it out yet.  Like, what am I doing here?  What happened?  I just went straight in and there was like a piled wire, like straight...  My head first straight into the ground.  Yeah.  If there were a comic book noise, it would have been something like a skronk.  Yeah.  Ozzy almost died doing that fucking...  I know, right?  ATVs are rough, man.  The first ATV accident I had... 
[01:27:30]  Who gets to use that?  Is that the first time?  Yeah.  I was on, I think, Jimmy Kimmel, and I showed that clip, and Ozzy was the other guest, and he's  sitting next to me, and after the show, he followed me around backstage for like 45 minutes,  like this doddering grandmother, saying, Anthony, Anthony, don't do that again.  Anthony, you could have died.  I said, Anthony, come here.  And he's grabbing my hand and running it along his collarbone so I could feel all the plates  in there.  Oh, right.  Feel his injury.  He's on plates?  Yeah.  He was personally horrified by this thing, and he just took it upon himself to bring me 
[01:28:00]  back to the light.  You know what the thing about ATVs are, too?  You get on.  You start riding.  And at first, you're kind of cautious.  You're feeling it out.  But in no time, you really think you have it down.  Yeah.  Because you start going a little faster.  You know, you get your balls, and you're like, yeah, this is good.  And meanwhile, you haven't been riding the thing more than 20 minutes.  You've gone from, you know, very slow, just figuring it out, to now you're a pro, going 
[01:28:30]  off jumps, going through water, taking tight turns, sliding.  Yeah.  It's like, no, you're not good.  No.  This thing is overpowering you.  And then you got it in the back of your head.  You got to get some good footage for the TV show.  Well, that, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, there was that.  Were you driving worse than you should have because you knew the camera was rolling?  Probably a little bit.  Compared to what?  I suck.  I mean, I should be on one.  Oh, man.  What other, any other catastrophes during the show? 
[01:29:00]  During that one, no.  You know, we have a Libya show coming up, which is the best thing I've ever done.  I mean, it was awesome.  And then I think since I said it was last, the Congo, which was the hardest show we've ever  done.  Yeah, huh?  What made the Congo hard?  There's probably an obvious answer there.  There's 29 different rebel groups.  Right.  And, you know, this shit goes wrong at every turn.  I mean, it's a country without really much infrastructure.  And the worst case scenario, like if things go wrong, like you're robbed or extorted or 
[01:29:30]  something, or you get a flat tire and you find yourself in the middle of boobies.  Robbery and extortions in the same category as a flat.  The worst case scenario is that the cops of the army come to help you out.  Oh, really?  Then let the real, then it gets really bad.  Why is that bad?  They're pretty good at, you know, rape and murder are pretty much, you know, the specialty.  For the cops in the military?  It's bad.  Really bad.  So if they come to help you, are you saying that?  It's the worst thing that could possibly happen.  They're not going to help you. 
[01:30:00]  They're professionals that will rob you.  Look, a rebel dude wants to take your stuff.  You could say, I mean, I guess you could say, fuck you, I'm not giving it to you.  And you could run.  Or you could, you know, maybe punch somebody or make a break for it.  I mean, not that that would be a good idea.  But when the, an official, I mean, the army have, they've stolen the diplomatic bag from  like the ambassador.  I think the French ambassadors.  I forget which one.  But I mean, they just don't have any problem.  Right.  You've given me that.  And if you fight back, you're, you know. 
[01:30:30]  Now it's an official problem.  You're going to put you in jail forever.  That's probably not a good jail either.  I bet a jail in the Congo.  Oh, my God.  I bet it's not, you can't really protest for better conditions.  It is probably, it is, natural resource wise, it's the wealthiest country in Africa.  It's the size of all Western Europe.  It's beautiful.  It's a very, very, very, very complicated situation.  But it really was an adventure.  And I got to say a privilege to see you now. 
[01:31:00]  How do you stay safe?  It's, look, it's dangerous.  There's no guarantees, eh?  It's a place where the situation changes from minute to minute, where everything, you know,  you just got to be really careful.  You don't carry arms.  You drive around in vans with TV written on the side and a big sign with an AK, like a  silhouette of an AK with a red circle.  Right, that you don't have any weapons.  You do not have any weapons.  So nothing to see here, folks.  Nothing particularly good to steal. 
[01:31:30]  You don't, you don't travel with armed security.  That just isn't going to.  Why is that?  Because it's 29 different official rebel groups.  Those are the ones with names.  Oh, shit.  My, my, who are local defense forces.  You just make yourself a big fat target if you, if you're, if you're in any way armed.  I mean, you have security people, you have local fixers who sort of, you know, the idea  is to argue your way out of a situation, finesse your way out of a situation.  There's a lot of, uh.  You did have a fixer or you didn't? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  You have to have Congolese who are looking after you who know, okay, this guy needs 10 minutes  of FaceTime, a lot of handshakes and maybe a fruit basket.  This is, this guy's a problem.  Time to get in the van and, you know, get out of here.  Wow.  Like, who was the problem?  Would it be like a local chief or?  Local security, whoever the sinister local, you know, head of the internal security ministry  is, but.  A lot of ministries.  I don't like a place with ministries. 
[01:32:30]  What's weird though is like, even in the middle, we're up in, uh, what was essentially  in the book, the heart of darkness, you know, where Kurtz was, and we're about a hundred  clicks out of there, middle of the jungle, no power anywhere, nothing resembling running  water.  Five bars on a cell phone.  We're tweeting from the middle of the jungle.  Holy shit.  That's pretty amazing.  Yeah.  We would love our friend, Jonathan, right?  Oh yeah.  My manager goes to, he's never been in the Congo, but he goes to crazy, uh, takes crazy 
[01:33:00]  trips.  He's obsessed with travel and he's got the same kind of view you do.  Like he just wants to see these places and he doesn't go in armed.  He doesn't, you know, he just, he took a tour of Africa recently and you know, just, he  said the driving was the worst part because you get motion sick because the roads are  so fucking twisted and the infrastructure is just non-existent.  Yeah.  You get to tenderize kidneys.  He didn't go where Anthony went though.  He didn't go like that.  It was, it was like an amazing, amazing experience. 
[01:33:30]  And what'd you end up filming in the Congo?  Oh man, everything.  I mean, uh, Goma, you know, we start out at Goma in Eastern Kivu, which is very contentious  area and then sort of centered on Conrad, Apocalypse Now, the heart of darkness and  the kind of took a look at the history of the Congo through the Congo river.  And wow.  It's a lot of history to, to, to try and discuss in a visual way.  Cause most people look at the Congo and they just throw their hands up in the air and they 
[01:34:00]  say, I, you know, it's too much.  I can't, uh, you know, how do you explain this in three minutes, much less 42 minutes?  Um, so, you know, we try to do that in, in, in, in a visual way that's, but, um, is it,  is it scary when you, you said that you have a handler and like the guys are talking to  the local guy and you don't know if they're being, you know, cause other times in the  language barrier, you don't know if they're screaming at each other.  Is that just how these guys talk or are they, is there a problem?  You get used to that really quick, but there is a lot of screaming and threats. 
[01:34:30]  Jesus.  It's, that's called negotiation.  Sounds crazy.  Sounds exhausting.  You know, him, arrest him, you know, that sort of thing.  But your guy would say to you like, all right, we can't fix this.  It's time.  How did you know that you weren't going to be stopped when the guy goes like, Hey, this  guy's a problem.  Look, there were a lot of, a lot of moments where this situation is bad and these are our  options, you know, make a run for it or, you know, land or, or, or river, you know,  but we had really, really great fixers who were just really good at going through the process, 
[01:35:00]  meaning there's a screaming, yelling and threats process.  Then there's a talk them down process.  And there's, we'll, you know, we'll have some warm beer and maybe some money will be exchanged.  We'll negotiate.  Well, what were they mad about?  You, you, you came to, you talked to the mayor first.  You didn't come right to me first.  Oh, God.  The mayor got a fruit basket and I'm putting him in jail.  You're, you know, you should have come to me first.  Wow.  Putting you in jail?  Well, where's the mayor? 
[01:35:30]  It's like management here.  And then I cannot guarantee your safety, you know, which is not a good thing to hear.  No.  Is that a threat almost?  Because it's not, it's not guaranteeing your safety.  We're going to make it very difficult.  Yeah.  We're going to do it ourselves.  I can't guarantee your safety is definitely not what you want to hear where we were.  So there's no right answer.  Obviously.  You're always pissing off somebody.  Yeah.  Look, man, you're also, you're in a situation where any, any state employee probably hasn't  been paid anything in six months. 
[01:36:00]  There were guys showing up at the train station and kissing on you.  I don't think it's been fully operational, if operational at all, since like early 60s  and only partially operational since the 70s.  Oh, my God.  Their whole staff shows up.  And I mean, the whole train station's overrun.  The tracks are overrun, everything.  They show up every day and they, they do their job.  They, they, they try to keep the trains repaired every day with no money. 
[01:36:30]  Guys who show up at the, you know, this moldering library in the middle of the jungle, they show  up hoping, they just show up to work.  They put on their jacket, they tie, they go in and there's a library and just, we went  to this like Belgian research center in the middle of the jungle.  It was pretty awesome.  Wow.  It was like really, really wild.  What's the library like?  Huge, like, uh, futurist, uh, kind of, uh, you know, Futurama style library complex that 
[01:37:00]  thousands of people used to work at, uh, out in the middle of the jungle, but overgrown  completely.  You see a lot of that.  I mean, you see the hotel where, uh, Bogart and Bacallst and, uh, and, uh, Catherine Hepburn  stayed during African queen, you know, it used to be a really beautiful, uh, industrialized,  uh, wonderland for white people.  Yeah.  I mean, the Congolese weren't allowed to walk their own streets, but if you were a middle  class Belgian, you were, you were living large in the Congo, you had railways and modern buildings 
[01:37:30]  and infrastructure, sports club, you know, the, the pool, the health, you know, the golf  courses, all of that.  And, uh, you know, when they split the Belgians, they plugged the toilets with cement, scuttled  everything at sight.  And since they hadn't allowed anyone to, you know, go beyond, I think like middle school,  they, you know, they left like eight qualified guys in the whole Congo to run a country.  What year did the Belgians leave?  Uh, early sixties.  Why were they such pieces of shit about it? 
[01:38:00]  Uh, man, they were not, uh, before the Belgians, the whole country was owned by King Leopold  of Belgium.  And he basically, uh, killed half the population, uh, pushing them to collect rubber and ivory.  And if you didn't bring in your quota for rubber, um, by hand tapping it and extracting,  cut your arms off.  Jesus.  There were people who were paid by the arm.  This was in the 20th century.  It's kind of like kicking over the sandcastle before you leave the beach. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  Not uncommon.  A lot of, a lot of guys in Africa, a lot of, I mean, it wasn't just the Belgians.  Also, to be fair, uh, the, the, the Congolese, as soon as they got independence, uh, you  know, made this mistake of, uh, democratically electing.  Basically a communist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who we quickly had killed.  Okay.  Us and the British and, uh, the Belgians.  And, uh, so we were not too eager to see them succeed, particularly given the large uranium  deposits in the country, which we did not want to fall in the hands of the Russians. 
[01:39:00]  So, you know, it did not make us unhappy at that particular period of time that the country  was not working.  So without the colonialism there now and stuff, what is the issue now?  They're surrounded, uh, they're bristling with diamonds, gems, uh, natural resources,  uh, that everybody wants.  They've got neighbors like Rwanda with huge displaced, uh, uh, armies have been kicked out  of Rwanda now running around in the Congo, um, because the last president, any president 
[01:39:30]  actually, they can't rely on their own army.  Anytime they have problems within the country, they make a line.  And they basically rent out or sell off their national resources to neighbors, uh, neighboring  countries who send in armies to ally with the current president, uh, and then hang around  and make sure that they get to keep stuff.  So there are all of these surrogate armies controlled by the neighbors as well as all 
[01:40:00]  these little breakaway groups who one minute, you know, 10 minutes ago were working with  the army and the national government and are now allied against them.  Have you ever thought like, what's the solution here?  What would be the solution to get a, a viable world, world accepted, uh, uh, country there?  It's so big.  That's the problem.  I mean, it's a thick, the size of all Western Europe.  Yeah.  Capital and most of it's jungle.  So it's really, really hard.  Um, look, they need a, they need a large functioning management class for sure. 
[01:40:30]  Uh, but you know, we can hardly pull that off in this country.  You said something back there that everything's being overgrown.  Yeah.  That must've been really cool to say.  It's, it's, it's hauntingly beautiful.  Right.  Uh, to see, you know, and the Bogart hotel where they stayed.  Yeah.  That's one of the places that's completely overgrown.  It's a squat now, but it was called the poor qua pa hotel.  And I'm reading a memoir as I'm, you know, looking at it. 
[01:41:00]  And yeah, did you go inside of it?  Yeah.  And it's just being overgrown.  Well, I mean, there's squatters living in it.  Wow.  Jeez.  And that library is not used for anything anymore, right?  There's, there's, there are a few, you know, there are still a few, um, a few Congolese, uh,  students who were trying to make use of that research.  And, um, it's heartbreaking.  You know, people are trying, but it's really, really tough.  That's a situation where you fight to live every day. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, has that given you a, uh, like, how has it changed your perspective of the United  States at all?  Uh, when you see stuff like that and it's stuff that, I mean, only a small percentage of people  in America would even see that, uh, how has it changed your, your, you know, if I hear  somebody whining about writer's block, you know, how hard people will work just to stay clean,  you know, how, how, how, how hard they'll work to just to, you know, maintain their pride, clean 
[01:42:00]  clothes, clean body, you know, that's, uh, uh, it's, it's not what you expect.  Does it give you more patience here?  Do you, are you more patient with things or you, you, you, you, you're thinking that there,  you know, when the ferry goes out and it's another seven hour away to get across the river  and that's every day, you, you know, you think, you know, I'm never going to yell at a traffic  light again.  Yeah.  The one minute that it's taking, God damn it. 
[01:42:30]  I missed the light.  We've been mixing it, you know, I mean, look how easy I got it.  I mean, there, okay, we're bitching about, okay, God, if I just, just one, one, one toilet,  you know, one, one good shower, um, you know, but that's for what a week, 10 days,  the next show I'll be in Spain, you know, eating tapas and, you know, drinking red wine.  Have you taken a lot of shits outdoors?  Yeah, we're professionals, man.  We, uh, you're real good at, uh, you know, all of these things you never thought you'd 
[01:43:00]  have to learn.  We've, we're getting real good at, yeah, the alfresco dump, yes.  Do you ever think like I'm going to this place and, uh, I've, I've, I've overstepped this  time, we made, we made a mistake thinking we were going to be safe and we are, I mean,  I know you have a lot of scary moments, but has there been any times where you're like,  I really fucked up this time?  Me, no.  Uh, there were some, there were some days in Libya, there were some time because there 
[01:43:30]  was stuff going on around us.  I mean, it wasn't like, oh my God, we're going to die.  But this situation was getting worse every day and there was a lot of discussion whether  to stay or go.  Like every day there were, there was an emergency meeting.  Okay.  This is the latest security briefing.  And our security guys were not, you know, when your security guys would say, look, if  we'd known before what we know now, we wouldn't have come.  Great, man. 
[01:44:00]  And so every day it was sort of like the whole crew had a vote.  Are we bugging out for the airport or are we going to try to hang on for another few  years?  How would you vote?  I, I voted to stay.  I, I mean, I felt pretty sick.  I'm not a heroic guy by a long shot, but I didn't see any immediate, it looked okay to  me.  I mean, we, the people around us were cool.  The Libyans were very cool with us because there was stuff happening outside of our view  that was, that was worrying.  We talked to, we have the vice guys in sometimes and, and, and, uh, and I love their documentaries. 
[01:44:30]  And Shane was saying that that's the worst place of all the places.  The scariest was, was Juarez, Mexico.  Yeah.  Would you go there?  Would you go to certain places in Mexico at this point?  Or do you think you might want to avoid that?  I don't know.  It would, it depends on what the, what the situation is.  I'm not looking to put, unlike them, I'm not looking to put my head up into a firing  line just for good TV.  Right.  I mean, that's, I'm there for another reason and I'm willing to accept a certain amount 
[01:45:00]  of risk if there's a really good story or something interesting there, but I'm not  looking at, you know, Hey, look at me.  I'm in Juarez.  Right, right, right.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  I mean, I, I love, I love Mexico.  So, I mean, I'd love, if, if you tell me, if enough people tell me it'll be okay, we've  been to a lot of places where they say you shouldn't go that turn out to be really cool.  When you're, when you're in these places, like, uh, do you come back here and, and see  news from the Congo and from Libya and does it affect you more in that way? 
[01:45:30]  Do you have to carry this around with you now going, you know, not only feeling bad  for your own country and what's happening here, but now you gotta, you gotta have empathy  for like half the fucking globe.  I don't know.  You know, it's, it's, uh, it's weird.  You, you steal your heart to a lot of things.  I think that's what I assume.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  You, you, you have to, I mean, I've seen this happen with NGOs and people who work in  environments like that, you know, just in order to get to work every day without having  a breakdown, constantly weeping, you, you, you inure yourself to certain things. 
[01:46:00]  I get angry seeing really stupid coverage of places like, uh, Libya.  Um, you know, no clue.  You know, they're actually idiots out there saying, you know, we were better off with  Gaddafi.  Oh, really?  You know, really?  Uh, it, it is a, people say this with authority, having never been to Libya, never having met these  kids, the majority of people who overthrew, they, they get their news sources, the most,  you know, cretinous, uh, you know, fringe, you know, under-informed conspiracy theory website. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're pretty, you know, Gaddafi, and they're, and this is from both left and right,  you know, oh, Gaddafi was better.  No, no, he wasn't.  And the majority of the people who, who threw him out were people that you would like hanging  out with, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the pool, there were kids who were, you know, playing like, uh, PlayStation, you know,  a week before they, they went to war.  Yeah.  Went home, you know, from Western universities to, to fight against the guy. 
[01:47:00]  I mean, you know, they fought Soviet tanks with handmade weapons built out of like, uh,  plastic and hair dryers.  Right, man.  So, yeah, I got a lot of, it, you know, it made, when I see really stupid, uh, uninformed  news coverage, it makes me a little cranky.  And, and, and much like, uh, soldiers and, and police officers and whatnot, and you don't  have to be specific, but were there, were the, was there some form of gallows humor a little  between you guys to just see some horrible things? 
[01:47:30]  And, and, and in order to even deal with it, have to, you know, make a little, you reach  this, you reach this stupid zone where, yes, you know, it's, it's like, uh, to cope, coping  mentally.  Yeah.  Well, then you just start to like getting gearily obsessed with, you know, it's a constant 
[01:48:00]  remain, especially when you're sort of, you know, when you're taught, but you're really  tired yeah and run going going going you're stressed you're scared uh you're reading you  know you're reading news reports of just like unbelievably awful shit yes you make stupid uh  and wildly inappropriate humor right right no doubt about it what do you what do you where do you go  on personal vacations like where do you like going around around the world look any beach

[01:58:00]  sausage with the peppers and the onions doesn't that smell good to you sure smells good to me  and i know every single time it's going to be you know 30 seconds over tokyo you know i don't care  you don't puke though right no you get a little gurgling freckling the bowl  situation he doesn't care about getting the run no yeah you get a little percolating going 
[01:58:30]  street gyros you know that's a pretty high likelihood of problems yeah of problems yeah  yeah yeah you know it's a it's really just a scheduling issue right if you have some time and  you don't mind yeah freckling the bowl is probably the best way that yeah that just took the top  place over spraying mud i like you freckling the bowl yes yes hey there's photos of ufc for the  weekend uh oversight did you enjoy it um i thought the uh roy a big country was amazing amazing 
[01:59:00]  that overhand right is a thing of beauty it was incredible because he's up this guy he's up against  this guy who looked like uh you know a gladiator check congo yeah it was really uh that was impressive  it was just a weird night i mean there were a lot of disqualifications and and early stoppages over  you know eye injuries a broken thumb a broken toe did you see the broken toe video yet so bad i thought  well yeah i was right there and what was amazing was he i don't think he had any idea no i think rogan 
[01:59:30]  pointed it out to him he said dude your toe's broken and he started a he started i'm not going to say  faint but clearly yeah yeah yeah it was drained out of his head and he had to sit down he was having  a problem talking i mean he he had no idea he had all that adrenaline and he looks down it's like  it was turned completely upside down it's not flipped over but if if anyone thinks for a second  that well if they hadn't stopped the fight you know gutchell would have totally no he was not making it 
[02:00:00]  another 23 seconds i've said i was sitting with his family and uh right next to me uh and he saw  his interview after um things were not going to improve for him really getting yeah getting hurt we  were watching that i wonder what moment he knew because he's a tough guy and but then there was  he said at first he complained but then he's like no it was a good stoppage like he kind of felt like 
[02:00:30]  they it was they were right to stop it if you're a fan of somebody and i i i like you also i think he's  one of the funniest brightest smartest you know this is a guy who's gonna have a huge long after  his fight career he's gonna have a huge career in broadcasting and just he's very very likable and  really really smart you know even if you're a fan and this is what i don't get you know i i i don't  want the guy to get brain damage or or hurt for my momentary entertainment okay the the outcome of the  fight you see this again again the outcome of the fight is clearly determined here you know which way 
[02:01:00]  it's going to go yeah i'm not going to be happy until he's unconscious and drooling and with a  doctor looking right his eye his pupils are fixed and dilated you know i don't need to see that i  don't demand that as a fight fan i mean yeah yeah a lot of people was settled i guess a lot of people  are waiting for that miraculous comeback and but it's like like you said you you know which way this is  going there comes up there comes a point there it happened a number of times where you the belcher 
[02:01:30]  fans are you know yelling like things are going to get better for him they clearly weren't you're not  going to be happy until he's unconscious and you'll feel better yeah there was one moment of restraint  shown which i really liked like uh it was after it was when nelson hit congo and he hit him oh  fucking and and check congo just kind of collapsed like and he's a big big heavyweight and then as  he's kind of going down nelson hits him again which is very standard because he's he's still 
[02:02:00]  but then he went on his back and and roy came in and cocked and he didn't hit him which i liked because  he was so clearly out and nelson could have got off another shot and been okay and been justified  but i like the fact that he didn't do that because it's like man you got to realize if a guy is out  like that you could really hurt him and uh and he didn't do it which i liked yeah i mean i think  you know when you're dealing with a sport that is potentially as bloody as usc i think it behooves  everybody to be a little more aggressive on the judging you know if you're going to have that much 
[02:02:30]  blood it's good you should try to minimize the lasting injuries right right absolutely so you  worried about your wife doing this stuff well she does she competes in the brazilian jiu-jitsu so this uh  uh you know getting getting punched in the face is no but yeah she just did really well she was just  at uh new york just won gold at the new york open oh wow wow very very happy and uh i think she's 
[02:03:00]  gonna be competing a lot in amateur uh circuit over the next few months and she loves it do you like  the women and i like watching the women's fights i didn't think i'd like it at first but then you  realize that they bring it they they there's no none of that uh you know dancing around here they  go at it and and um i'm sure he's really exciting yeah she's right feel they have something to prove  i'm sure that you know we gotta really put this over the top and it's not like the the the women's  boxing used to be where it just looks like a bar fight with people stopping yeah yeah yeah really 
[02:03:30]  good fighters who who with really good precise form look i'd like to see the ron and rousey steven seagal  fight i i would pay big money to see that and i would totally bet on her yeah i would like to see  her totally choke that hump out why did he say something better no she said something about him  i think you know he was i don't know she was a you know sort of a joke of the moment thing but  personally i i would be curious to see how that fight that would be great to say we had her in  and she and she did like an arm bar on me and i was worried because like and he said you worried 
[02:04:00]  about well it's the one where they have something to prove but she was very gentle and she was  really a lot nicer than i thought she'd be but again there's no well i'm a man she's a woman so  i i could technically she could kick the dog shit out of me and relatively easily and i kind of sense  that in that moment yeah it's what it's awful i mean i live in my daughter's six but she already  does aren't you know mommy's taught her arm bar all right show triangle you know so like i'm yeah  running around it's like at any moment you know these two women in my house could be you know arm bar 
[02:04:30]  knee or getting their hooks in you know do you feel happy that your wife can defend herself too  you feel like safer for her this if anything ever happens she's capable oh yeah um yeah i really i  really feel bad for anybody who would uh you know make make the mistake of even getting lippy with her  but it's also nice to know that um you know every once in a while i get like you know the over  enthusiastic you know biggest fan ever at a bar or at some event and it's always your biggest fan who 
[02:05:00]  suddenly transforms from your biggest fan just like belligerent asshole that's that guy oh god damn i  can't you know that's i can't hit him or break a bottle over his head or obviously i'm going to be  in court for the rest of my life it's nice to know that if i were there with my wife she's coming back  from the bathroom and some asshole is getting lippy with me that you could totally choke him out  pretty much it's over for him yeah holy that's that's funny because uh yeah if you know you you 
[02:05:30]  have those dude yeah you're the best one more and then this is a great one they they go i just wanted  to say hi thanks thanks they walk away like a minute two minutes later they come back ask you a little  another question another and then if you try to say like look i'm i'm over here i'm talking with  this or i'm doing then you're an asshole then you you're the fucking asshole now yeah i was with we  were shooting uh the desert show with josh hami from queens of the stone age and uh this guy we're 
[02:06:00]  inside we're we're we're taking a break from shooting i'm having a beer with josh where we connect  we're talking this little fucking troll comes up and he's like i'm your biggest fan okay gee that's  great i saw you recently at a live show in another city it's great so i guess that means i pay your  salary okay but okay i'm i'm i'm cool this is my wife would really like a picture uh i said well that  will i'm happy to do it you know bring her by i'll be happy to take a picture i'm not going anywhere

[02:07:00]  friend go fuck yourself at which point he starts to you know with the finger at which josh picks  this guy up by his throat he's shaking i'm like a little smurf it was great oh what kind of a  douchebag would expect you to go out and see his wife in the parking lot like don't try to be a hero  to your wife at my expense that is true he doesn't pay your salary i stand corrected it's probably i was  happy to do it right right all your friends i'll stay all day long exactly any pictures 
[02:07:30]  whatever i'm going to trot around to different locations dark desert parking lot oh he's trying  to kidnap drunk troll yeah yeah there's a bunch of guys out there with like duct tape ties and an open  van door and he's gonna pull up he's gonna try to kiss you by the car like philip seymour hoffman  that would be cool that that look even that's where the finger you know the stabbing in the  chest with the finger but you can feel it shift too and they're like dude i love you and then there's 
[02:08:00]  one thing you don't do it like oh what the fuck i'm blah am i bothering you you're not keeping it real  man uh what do you want me to do jerk you off at the bar i said hello i'm happy to see you  it's amazing like i i i never say no before ever ever will i do it but once in a while they  you do something that they perceive as rude because they're drunk but a defense would be  not doing the tequila shot oh yeah yes you know that suddenly like you're you know you're 
[02:08:30]  an asshole because you're not you're not drinking with it yeah yeah got that one right yeah come  you eat food they send you or no because he won't and i i'll do my best you will you know  i'll try yeah yeah i i take a look at who it is you know see who it's coming from that's the  situation if they're covered with open sores right right you know they got that  fucking thousand yard stare and trying putting a prescription bottle back in their pocket  could be an issue yeah you know those little pill balls and a crusher 
[02:09:00]  dummy who did the tylenol thing and she kept a fucking pill ball in her sink a mortar and pestle  you know what it was yeah a pill ball what a pill ball and a crusher  but that's how a normal person says it what did you call it  a mortar and pestle exactly that's how somebody who's poisoning  fucking aspirin bottles  hey what's that pill crusher thing that's how every non-feminist refers to it yeah that doesn't  show up in google i think you're right 
[02:09:30]  what is your show on by the way sunday's nine o'clock cnn  sunday nine o'clock and yeah i'm so happy with how it's going and i gotta tell you  you know cnn is not a place you think they'd have like a big sense of humor right they do  yeah they've been really really great get it good for you they gave me my id the other day  oh yeah that opens doors like i actually i could walk into cnn wow and swipe and like the doors open  up and i'm just wandering around like i actually work in it do you see do you see the people that you  know are on camera all the time hey how you doing and they're actually like fun yeah news 
[02:10:00]  people uh i i do stuff over at fox news and news people are they're uh quite a partying bunch first  of all they have better hair over there yeah oh yeah i've never seen people that can drink as much  as news people yeah they can fucking drink they love going out afterwards and because they've seen  one on at the local gin mill they've seen the shit yeah maybe that's uh they've seen the stuff 
[02:10:30]  they can't air you know shooting in libya and the congo for me look i'm there for a week yeah after a  week i'm like oh man i need a shower like i'll kill for a shower you know i just can't i need something  to eat you know people like christian amapur and barbara star and uh people like that have been you know  for decades oh yeah and bar province and places like right it was like and and also working in  situations where you know your car rolls up at the location and your security guys are saying okay  you've got 10 minutes here okay you're getting you get in and you get back in the car and uh wait a 
[02:11:00]  minute that guy over there was speaking on a cell phone just picked up a cell phone you're getting  back in the car now 10 years of that that's pretty i got a lot of respect for people who do that for a  living yeah yeah um and um i i gotta say i'm grateful because here you know when they announce the show  it's my i've been doing snarky food and travel tv for a while you would think that a lot of people  at cnn who've been doing hard news would not be happy to see me show up they've been pretty they've 
[02:11:30]  been really very friendly to me and very very welcoming which yeah you know if i was in their  position i'd say who's this asshole you're canceling news for this but you fit the bill over there like  you're one of the rare shows that can transcend that because you do travel and you are showing the world  and you are showing these odd locations and these kind of at times dangerous places you're  not you're not doing it just from something and it's not like it's steve o doing it you know you're  kind of knowledgeable about things and you know you're what i don't get is i i've been getting 
[02:12:00]  like a lot of tweets or facebook posts from fans who say like this you know i love your show i always  used to watch it but now that you're on the communist news network i'm not i'm not gonna watch you  know it's like okay you watch you like my show but because it's on the same network as news  who's you know general bent you you don't you don't like you're not gonna watch it i was like  you what's the part you're afraid that you know i might accidentally see another you know after i  see your show i might see another five minutes and suddenly become overwhelmed by a compulsion of 
[02:12:30]  like you know see joe biden's penis you know it's like oh my god i feel myself turning gay and  communist you know you're so fucking weak-minded that you can't handle you can't distinguish  between one show and another and this one i watch fox all the time you know it's like i don't feel  like you know uh i'm gonna it's gonna you're gonna be brainwashed all of a sudden all of a sudden  because it's on for two or three minutes yeah what are we going to see in future episodes  uh let's see with congo libya uh next week is a truly terrifying over the top quebec show i mean just 
[02:13:00]  an assault of delicious food that will will really frighten people um what's their main dish up there  the one thing you have to have they like foie gras and um you know we were there in winter so it's a  lot of maple syrup pork of the finest wines known to humanity um quebec has the finest wine

[02:16:00]  him on after the show one he's still alive oh yeah he's still alive he still hasn't grown a damn  centimeter no he looks exactly the same what's mike laughing what are they doing together sam  in this video let's see it what are they singing why don't we uh kenan's road  every time that you look in my help miss you'll be everything 
[02:16:30]  weird hands  isn't he the guy that gets like millions of views on the video except for the one that you've shot opie  yeah yeah thanks for reminding me but that was a guarantee yes that was my guarantee and that  that up that obviously i did no no i think someone fucked it up though because the oh um  um yeah because we didn't i don't know i forgot about the music oh i remember what was it because  you took could you explain uh this kid right keenan cahill made this huge he just just lip syncs 
[02:17:00]  youtube sensation because he's crazy weird looking but he lip syncs right what was his famous video  i don't know he's the one that put him over the top i don't remember exactly which one well  hold on could it be the one that has wait you're moving too fast uh 55 million views wow when he did  teenage dream it's probably before that or is it the one he did with 50 cent where it's 50 million  views yeah but yeah he's he's got millions and millions and millions of views but he was on the 
[02:17:30]  show and he was lip syncing yeah and so obviously since it was on the radio i had to talk and just  kind of hype it up while he lip synced all right because or it's just or it would just be you'd hear  the song right but then but i say that my video channel is way more important radio show but sam  didn't see it that way unfortunately well no so opie filmed it and then i told him you have two options  you could use the audio that we have or you could just take the original song and just sync it for 
[02:18:00]  his lip syncing but then he chose to use the show audio because i was very excited and i thought i had  a viral video so i just wanted to get up get it up there immediately i was extremely excited and that  took people out of the mix well then they started hating on sam because he's talking right he did  right what he was supposed to do because it is a radio show in the end or it just turns out to be a uh  uh katie perry song i think it was because we were even excited like oh my god he's never done  this song before this is this the one how many did it get he looks a little older now than he did then 
[02:18:30]  well 47 000 yeah that's just like getting 47 million views 47 000 oh boy look look at this  another failure thumbs up if you want sam gone from the 10 o'clock hour and replaced with a mongoloid  or a chimp i fucking hate sam's voice we get it shut up stupid uh sam is trolling this little  wad of jizz uh well let's hear let me hear it i want to i want to kick sam in the head 
[02:19:00]  uh this is more an anti-sam video well because he doesn't you know there's a a disconnect let's  hear it mediums i forgot all i forgot i even filmed this to be honest with you it was a while back  this was a few years ago yeah hit it erock all right so he's moving his head visually it looks  good he's a freak of nature moving his head like he's hip 
[02:19:30]  through that kool-aid follow my lead yeah that's fucking up but not though  it's like he's singing i'm watching him and it's like he's singing it i like this  but it's kesha oh the who kids on there because it's the show it's like kesha but more good looking  you're totally ruining the thing that made you know why did you put it you should have just put  it up without sam all right it's too depressing it's too depressing i can't i can't look at it i 
[02:20:00]  told him i was like you should have put it up without the song i don't know why you did that  why did you get so eager he makes funny faces and then he was like okay well i just put up the  interview then right that much done good yeah that's 22 000 22 000 he's two and a half feet tall  this guy's so small he's yeah why are you reminding me of my failures  he has gotten older though not really yeah no he looks a lot younger there than he does in that 
[02:20:30]  new video it's just his hair is growing yeah that's the only thing that grows on him is his hair  so to give the illusion he's older now right are you kidding me he's the same look at the exact same  face he's got a couple other videos of him doing different kesha songs without your meddling  and they've got four and five million views oh my god so maybe i re uh  dad redo it no it's it's done it's done you sure it's finished kenan he's not even big anymore  no not really it's finished he's done is it over yeah it's a bit over are those the lowest viewed

[02:27:30]  comes in i'm fine you're sure sure i uh i saw your twitter over the weekend i love lucy color yeah  how cool is that that was fucking weird isn't it weird they said they set it up really cool because  they had the original i love lucy episode right and uh ricky's at the his club there the tropicana  he's playing his conga drums his little bongos and he's doing and then it's cut 
[02:28:00]  to a member of the audience who apparently had a color fucking camera yeah but how big was that camera  back i know right or maybe a fucking 55 or maybe it was someone uh it shot like someone was trying  to hide it's just home movie it was it was a home movie camera and they i was thinking if the studio  set it up for whatever reason like look you know we could shoot this in color but obviously yeah it's  not uh cost effective so we're not gonna do anything with this for i bet he didn't even have to hide it  dude back then they were probably like yeah whatever guys in the audience sure they didn't think 
[02:28:30]  about you know oh it's gonna get out but them going from color to black and white that was  that's a terrific video can you put it on the facebook page it is really cool and and i was  never i never really knew what was actually in color on the set if they if they set things up with  color or just everything was black and white because it's a black white show so all you need is black  and white right but it's apparently everything was in color lucy's hair is very red and how did that 
[02:29:00]  black and white shit work have you ever looked into it meaning meaning there's a way where black  and white looks really cool but if you saw with your uh your regular eyes it would be probably  wacky colors to get those black and white shades right right yeah don't you think yeah yeah there's  probably an expert back then going okay you got to wear lavender and fucking orange because it looks  red because it'll look in black and white it'll look cool in black and white yeah yeah they must have  had to have done something like that looked at the black and white and thought all right that doesn't look  good yeah the real colors right the blue uh jacket doesn't look good in black and white so we're 
[02:29:30]  going to change it to a whatever color yeah one of the famous examples of course is a hitchcock and  psycho uh the blood never looked right they couldn't get the blood going down the drain looking right  looking right in black and white it never looked like they would imagine blood would look uh going  down the drain so they used hershey's syrup right which is brown and and shit but that's what they used  and it uh but i bet you at first they used some kind of some kind of red and it just didn't look  right in black and white look right in black and white so they used hershey's zero what we're 
[02:30:00]  talking about yeah totally all right i think but it was so weird to see color uh footage yeah color  footage from i love lucy and it's better that it's just an audience member doing it it's so weird  like to see them going back and forth it's i love lucy and some guy in the audience had a color camera  so he's uh filming it and they intersperse it with the actual episode uh on this clip so you see them  doing the bit and then you see it in color which is you know crazy this was not color corrected 
[02:30:30]  no no that's a guy with a color fucking oh no the footage is kind of shitty because he's filming  around yeah hit play let me see what uh see what it uh looks like going from yeah here's the actual  scene from the show 
[02:31:00]  it's like lucy would blow desi like a seal  she's hot man back then no yeah look at that though man it is so weird  wow it looks like someone's just called home movies let's see what I mean by 
[02:31:30]  the colors those are weird cause you never picked those yeah like that brick  wall is peach right  all I think of is the gangbang song someone thinking and then oh here's the  apartment wow who did this must be a production guy I'm thinking oh not  necessarily it's the audience it's an audience they're talking before the scene 
[02:32:00]  yeah that's so fucking that's cool man Desi was very big into home movies too  there's a lot of colors color home yeah color home movies of the family and kids  at their pool and stuff like that Desi had a shitload of film it's so weird to  picture these people in color because you really just didn't just remember seeing  that apartment and them in black and white hope fred birds comes in that's  what I wanted to talk to you about I have a surprise for you blue jacket you do 
[02:32:30]  yes something that should make you very happy Lucy Lucy you mean yes I can fuck as  as many starlets as I want I think your favorite time oh boy  ah  it's so fucked up  I just go back to the color line there's fred merch there's fucking William Frawley  they're coming out for a bow shaking hands yeah so you've seen footage that was never shown 
[02:33:00]  because yeah that's a cloud wow that's pretty cool that is pretty goddamn coal that oh boy look at Desi in the last fucking moments of his life  he was only sixty something there was he yeah it's from um 82 entertainment  tonight so then I looked up his age  well from radio to TV you know I couldn't sleep the other night turned on late night television and caught are you ready for this a rerun of an old I love Lucy show great 
[02:33:30]  that's amazing wow holy shit it was only on all the time yeah remember the year I think it was like 1951 what hit what a fucking 80s hairdo she has like D Wallace in the howling  yeah he died at 69  oh my god never been off the air  he looked like he was 90  he was 62 there  oh god look  that's all the  that's all the Philip Morris cigarettes 
[02:34:00]  64 actually  brought to you by Philip Morris  wow boy did Desi fuck everything  that came across his fucking transom  I told you we shot Lucky Louie right next door to that from the Hollywood Center Studios  yeah  and someone I did I did table reads in the studio that they used to shoot  really  I love Lucy and  and there's these steps going to the top of the  uh place where the offices were and someone was telling me that's where Lucy would have people watching  Desi  to make sure that he wasn't fucking any of the girls or taking them anywhere 
[02:34:30]  they would watch him from up there  just fuck  oh look at him all  bongoing  I will not  go back and  do as many things as I was doing at one time  you know  sounds a lot like Morris  I will not have to do  I will not have to do  I will not have to do  I will not have to do  be responsible for playing  I think he was riddled with cancer at that point  yeah  his lungs were gone  yeah  lung cancer  yeah  oh that's smoking  oh my god that's smoking  they used to do portraying a corrupt mayor in an upcoming movie called The Escape Artist 
[02:35:00]  well let me tell you something sunny  oh  something  when little boys make up stories  they have to be locked up in their rooms  now get him out of here  oh  what happened  Desi's life is running smoothly now  and despite a recent major illness  he sees a bright future  recent major illness  I see a bright future  diverticulitis  everybody thought that I was dying 
[02:35:30]  diverticulitis  oh  we keep us hard to get rid of  oh god  he probably didn't have a very good diet either  yeah  he only made it to 64  he only made it another  few years after that  Jesus  what are you like 84?  Lucy  uh  86  they would smoke on the show  five more years  I remember it was a  at some point  I guess Ricky's  mother showed up  and Lucy couldn't speak English  and she was trying to 
[02:36:00]  carry on some kind of conversation  so she gets a cigarette  and she  uh  goes  Felipe Mariso  Felipe Mariso  like trying to give her  a Philip Morris cigarette  getting the advertisers in there  Philip Morris  yeah yeah  they'd always pitch Philip Morris  hey we lost George Jones  over the weekend  yeah  that country legend  country guy  what was his big hit  uh  I don't know anything about  George Jones  except the name  I just kind of  I saw a picture of him  I was like  I remember him  he pops a song on  I'll know it  but I don't know 
[02:36:30]  yeah  what's this  this is a song  um  called uh  yeah  this is Johnny B. Goode  yeah  yeah  I don't know this  White Lightning  no  no I don't know  what that's a George Jones song  is what I'm saying  yeah  this isn't like  his big big hit 
[02:37:00]  is it  no  what's his big hit  oh  got me a gun  and wearing me a hat  I don't think  that's his hit  no I'm a feel  oh  what do you got  here  what was his big hit  I don't know  I just have a bunch  of number ones  I don't know  well  go through a couple  let's see if we could  hit on one  she thinks I still care 
[02:37:30]  she thinks I still care  just because I asked a friend about her  oh  just because I spoke her name somewhere  I bet this turns around  where it's like  she thinks like  but he really does  just because I rank her number  yeah listen  he's doing all these things  she thinks I still care 
[02:38:00]  but he's doing all those things right  so of course he still cares  just because I raped her  on the sofa  yeah  we're having a quick survey  on the phone lines  everyone's calling in with their  with their  George Jones songs  okay  they're all going with  he stopped loving her today  I'm  I'm looking for a third  let's see  confirmation  yeah 
[02:38:30]  yeah  yeah  everyone's saying  he stopped loving her today  I'll love you  till I die  man  she told him  you'll forget in time  did pops like George Jones  uh  he probably did  when you're listening to  K L A C  K L A C  best in the west  that was the old days  he's still praying  the country's channel  and now some Loretta Lynn  might have to get Denny down here

[02:41:30]  fermented  and then you ferment it  you rot it  you leave it  what  you leave it in the sun for a while  for weeks  oh no  weeks  is what I read  it ferments  and then you pickle it  who decided that's worth eating  I don't know  what kind of asshole wants that  like well I'd love to  that shark looks good  but could you leave it in the sun  for a couple weeks  and pickle it  and then we're going to  ferment it for a while  that must have been  starving people  in ye olde days  and then they were like  well it's rotting  we don't want to die  so let's pickle it  and hopefully that'll kill things  kill bacteria  I don't know 
[02:42:00]  it's supposed to preserve it  oh my god  I guess this type of shark  has no like urinary tract  so you can do some other stuff  with it  I don't know  wait how does it tinkle  I don't know  what  a no tinkling shark  that's actually the scientific name  so he  spell it for the listeners  H-A-K-A-R-L  we really want some of this to try  we're having a tough time finding it  somewhere in New York City  that I don't know about  yeah  what's it  was it  Chakarl  Chakarl

[02:46:30]  oh  what was that  wet stomach of an animal  oh  oh  that's disgusting  that was some of the worst  stuff I've ever had  why do we have to boil it again  they wouldn't let us have an open flame  so we  no we wanted to boil it  because  I don't know  I thought something happened  and that's why we  went down this road  Tracy had good ideas too  because she was saying  that every time we had  a different animal  we should play the sound effect  of the animal  right  oh did she love  the idea of sound effects  like if there was a pig 
[02:47:00]  hoping  right  that's a cow  I liked it when she came  in our studio  because she was hiding  from management  yeah yeah  I made for a good broadcast  not with her witchy poo hair  I know  I was attracted to her sexually  though  not in the least  if she came up to me  and offered me  anything I wanted to do  to her body sexually  I would just leave  it was  I would just leave

Islanders are going to  have a tough time  they're hot right now  they are kind of hot though  now it's embarrassing  because I've got to  make believe I'm  I've been Islanders  all day  look at him  he passed the studio  no that's  he passed the studio  what? 
[02:52:00]  that's different  that's an intern  and another  oh  oh  see  that's a gentleman  who enjoys the company  of other gentlemen  I believe that's a gentleman  who's never  who's never yelled  boo at a cock  just walked off  but if you're in a situation  where you can yell  boo at a cock  isn't that a little  suspect also?  well you know  yeah  well yeah  I believe that  when he sees a cock  his face  if you couldn't hear him  it would look like  he was yelling boo  boo  yeah but he wouldn't 
[02:52:30]  be yelling boo  he would be using  his lips  almost like when  you see a ship  dock  in a fucking  space movie  oh right  yes  yes  that's what he'd be  using his lips  as  sure  why is he  booing that penis  yet it's getting  closer to his mouth  oh I see  he really must hate it  he's getting closer  to boo it  yeah  why is his head  going up and down  in that man's lap  why is he booing  so vehemently  if that man's  holding his head  no I can't say  the cock anymore  but he seems to be  booing his balls  exactly 
[02:53:00]  and why is he  pointing accusingly  into the man's anus  as he booed  his cock  boy he really  hates cock  balls  and anus  yeah he's just  pointing and making  accusingly  making firm  accusations  he's so angry  he's beating  that man's penis  with the side  of his cheekbone  wow he hates it  ladies and gentlemen  stopping by to say hi  there he is  Mike Tyson  Iron Mike  what's up Mike 
[02:53:30]  there he is  take a seat  what's happening  in the news today  yeah there's all kinds  of shit going on  right  oh god I'm going  for it today  yeah  what happened today  taking love God  yeah this guy  is a  I guess he was  a politician  or something  and he  he's shacking up  with his 23 year old  interns  yeah  I'm wrong with that  right  yeah that's the one  that I think he was  having sex with  and that's the one  that they say  he might be having 
[02:54:00]  sex with now  you know  listen  listen  this is good stuff  man  I don't know  why it's bad  and I know  your guy's saying  Mike Tyson  shouldn't be one  commenting on this  stuff but you know  he should tell his wife  I don't want to be  married to you no more  and I want to be  married to my young  intern  who's old enough  to be my  you know  our youngest daughter  but still I love her  yes  exactly  you know  if that was an  older broad  with a younger guy  they'd be like  oh she's into the  you know  or the boy toys  and everything  and that would be  you know  acceptable  but now that guy's a pig 
[02:54:30]  we should arrest him  right right  we should arrest him  because he doesn't like  being with his wife  that has menopause anymore  right  we should arrest him  he wants that nice  supple ass  yeah  something small  and tiny  and petite  and nothing that  goes all around  like a big blubber  like you ever see  the balloon  the big bubble  the balloon  the bubble  the balloon  that's a big whale  the big soap bubble  and it's just  it's going in every direction  you don't know  where it's going to end up  don't get any of the big  sloppy  white 
[02:55:00]  big doe ass  yeah  put it on you  it goes over your leg  come down  what the hell  you gotta go like  it looks like she's been  it looks like she's been  sitting naked  in a gravel driveway  when she stands up  yeah  looks like she brushed  the gravel off  but the  bad stuff  that's terrible  bad stuff  exactly  I never liked  I never was into  big fat people  like I've done my share  of really awful ones  too  my criteria is just  breathing  I'm complaining now  but I've been talking  about the issue  I'm not complaining  about me being with her 
[02:55:30]  but I've been talking  about the issue  well you have to know  what you're talking about  so when you talk  about a big fat ass  you know  because you've been  there at some point  big fat  miserable  ass that you can't  form into anything  just drop  right right  and she didn't have  pants that'd be  at their knees  and stuff  yeah yeah  I can't believe  Tyson did some  pigging  you gotta do some  pigging  in order to know  the real god  you have to deal  with some pigging  there you go  I guess so  as they say  to appreciate  the rainbow  you have to 
[02:56:00]  experience the rain  oh no doubt  about that  and I've known  what it's like  to be with devil  worshippers  so I understand  it's all about  orgies and blood  and you know  it's good stuff  if you're in that  spiritual direction  of course  of course  isn't it funny  how mad people  get at this  like instead of  acknowledging that  every man would  want to do this  we kind of allow  these politicians  to be thrown  even if he's a good  politician  no because  when you're a politician  see that's why  Obama  Obama just hit  the nail home  on because he  said I've used  cocaine  see all those  other guys  never had 
[02:56:30]  the balls  I've used cocaine  it's cool  I've used cocaine  and now  look what I've accomplished  not everybody  I'm the exception  I'm not the rule  I'm the exception  I could use cocaine  during the college year  the best year  that my functioning brain  and still succeed  yeah  so he agrees with that  that's a big Obama guy  that's straight  what we did  you can't bring up  nothing from the past  that's like me  no past stuff  right  this is it  it's where I ended up  you know  everything else  is just the road  to get you where you are  right now 
[02:57:00]  you're not supposed  to that road  you know what I mean  I think that was  one of the biggest  things that ever happened  a lot of bumps  it came up  and he's flat  and we're honest  this is what it is  this is what we're dealing with  yeah  alright  and still we're going to  make this the best country  in the history  of this millennium  Mikey  I gotta say  I went and saw the show  last night  why thank you  holy fuck  I loved it  I was bummed it ended  and I hate sitting  through anything  why  you have to have patience  I love the show  this is my favorite show  I do  it was an hour and 40 minutes  of you talking 
[02:57:30]  Bob Backlund  Bob Backlund  Bob Backlund  he beat the Iron Sheik  yes  Bob Backlund  he beat Hulk Hogan too  but now I humble him  I humble him  I put in camel clutch  and fuck his ass  I love the Sheik now  I saw the Iron Sheik  not long ago  yeah  he used to do our show  he's batshit crazy now  he pissed his pants  on our show  one time  he was sitting back there  and I was taking a shot  he was drinking beer  and you could see  the spot in his pants  getting bigger and bigger  he literally  pissed his pants on the air 
[02:58:00]  he just had a go  he was drinking a little beer  it's the worst  slash greatest thing  I've ever seen in my life  was him pissing his pants  but he will bad mouth  everybody  and it's hilarious  Hulk Hogan  he's a faggot  I will fuck him in ass  you just crack it up  like this guy's  out of his fucking mind  I love it  he's out of his mind  but it's good  it's hilarious  it's hilarious  it's good stuff  but they're saying  he's mellowed now  that he's not like  into that anymore  he's kind of calmed down  he's not doing  he's just calmer now  his twitter's hilarious  I think they should do that  to you 
[02:58:30]  because I was with  Howard Stern  and you know  Howard Stern  he's  you know  he could be crazy  irritant sometimes  he's very nice  and polite  over the years  before I did the show  I said well I can do the show  now because how is  how is not the old Howard  he's very polite now  well you know  he cares about children  he has  the wife  the dogs  everything  he's very mellowed out now  he's not as radical  he cut the fro a little bit  things are going good  for him  he's doing docile now 
[02:59:00]  that'll do it  so it's probably a better time  to do it  than say 10 or 12 years ago  then we're talking  disgusting things  so Mike  tell me who you're banging  who  my wife  would you ever notice too  when you were doing interviews  how guys would talk to you  in a way  because there's this whole thing  of boxer and interviewer  where they never would have  spoken to you that way  if you had met them  in real life  like taking liberties  that they never should have taken  well that's just a part  of the business  you know  I might take liberties too 
[02:59:30]  you know  yeah true  I was always amazed  that people who would do that  like the only thing  separating you from a fucking beating  is the two microphones  right  you're hostile young man  last night  listen  last night  even I could see  during the pictures  when he's down  I could see  we're taking pictures  everything's great  but he still has to  don't fuck with me  look on his face  I'm like cool  and I'm putting my head  on his head  loosen up  that's right  but he has  he's right there  he's that way  always in these events  come take pictures  got the still 
[03:00:00]  don't fuck with me  watch  you know why  he's so obsessive  about his pictures  he's like focused  on just getting pictures  well you know what it is  it was Mike and LaMotta  and I'm like  what are you  serious to it  that's true  yes he's 91  I'm talking to him  he's coherent  he's sharp  that's amazing  you know  good for him  and he was right  he fought everybody  you know  the motto  Kush used to tell me this story  Jake LaMotta  you know back in the 50's  you know they had the mob  and they set your fight up  and it's just a big tough  it's a monstrous black  you want to fight him  no I don't want to fight him 
[03:00:30]  you want to fight him  and then you go to Jake LaMotta  and say hey Jake  who you want to fight  and Jake goes like this  this is so classic  that people don't know about it  Jake goes like this  I want to fight anybody  they don't want to fight  oh yeah yeah  just like that  I want to fight whoever  they don't want to fight  what a hard headed  motherfucker man  hard heart  yeah yeah  I was watching footage  of him last night  after the show  I went home  and was watching  Sugar Ray Robinson  and LaMotta fight  what a fight  they just  the amount of punches  he took  that's six fights 
[03:01:00]  amazing right  that's the last fight  you saw  that's six of them  six  that's unbelievable  that's crazy  three weeks apart  at one point  holy shit  come on  three weeks apart  listen  that's how they were used  fighters were used  like animals back then  that's crazy  and every fight  was a war  every fight  they had to go  to the hospital  but it's three weeks later  Jesus  you're still feeling  that last fight  three weeks later  right  this is what I know  about fighters  at least this is what  I know about myself  I read books  about fighters  and a lot of them 
[03:01:30]  are so scared  and sad  but they're afraid  to tell people  they're afraid  that's how they  handle their fear  they're afraid  they never tell anybody  they're afraid  they're cowards  and they still become  great fighters  and it's not like  now we can go  to a psychiatrist  where I feel like  I feel like a coward  I feel like this guy  is going to kill me  but you can't do that now  you've got to give me  some medicine  it's going to be alright  but now you've got to  deal with  oh this guy  is going to kill me  back then  you had to just  figure out  what the hell  you would do  with yourself  back then  and all those  great entertainers  were crazy acting 
[03:02:00]  because those guys  had mental illnesses  they just didn't  know how to  diagnose those guys  back then  were you ever afraid  someone was going  to see it in your eyes  when you were doing  the stare down  like I'm scared  and this guy  is going to know  by looking at me  that I'm feeling  fear right now  no because  the only thing  different about me  and the other fighters  that I fought  is that I understood  my feelings  I understand  when I felt fear  I understand  that didn't mean  that I was going  to be a loser  that meant  that I was preparing  me to be better  to excel to  you know what I mean  my highest potential 
[03:02:30]  yeah you were able  to turn it into  potential  we're being told  you have to go  they just want to  get ripped  they know I love  this show  we ain't even  talking crazy  we gotta have you  back on sometime  when you have  a little more time  Sunday night  Mike is it  is it this Sunday  in Westbury  Westbury  Westbury Music Hall  I highly recommend  everyone goes  and sees it  it was amazing  May 4th is Boston  May 5th is Westbury  the show is as  amazing as we told  you  I always look at  the newspaper too  to see this crazy 
[03:03:00]  thing  I'm going to do  a spoof  I'm the world  according to Tyson  and all my spoof  would be from  the newspaper  listen  this is what  I found out  remember at that  thing at the  Empire State Building  where everybody  got shot  I found out  that the cops  had shot everybody  yeah yeah yeah  I said god  I think of these  crazy guys  this is the cops  that shot everybody  we gotta get a  spoof on that  you know the cops  you got to  man down  bah  what the fuck  that would be  the show  if Tyson does  the news  she'd be fucking  doing a weekly  news show  what happened  mistrust of probe 
[03:03:30]  after she falls  look it's him  now  it's him now  that's a juror  that's a woman  juror who fell  for the guy  who I was convicted  of murder  amazing  well that happens  every day  you know you go  to the prison  you know this guy  killed everybody's  mother in prison  next thing you know  he falls in love  with the prison guard  and she marries him  gives him a baby  he then killed  everybody and everything  and everybody's  family member  but I just guess  we don't know  people on people  you know  life on life  terms  we don't know  why people do  what they do  Mike your people  are gonna get  very pissed  never  they're freaking out 
[03:04:00]  never  of course  these people  they don't get high  I'm the one  that get pissed off  to the highest  of festivity  highest festivity  alright Mike  thanks for stopping  this  thanks a lot Mike  take it easy  Mike Tyson  everyone  yes  holy fuck  I love him  the guy is great  and he's in  better shape  again 
[03:04:30]  every time he comes  in here  he's in better shape  the guy's jacked  is it creepy  that he noticed  I was just  lurking  yes  he fucking  remembered your  creepiness  with your pictures  you leave an impression  Jimmy  yeah  he loves coming on  though  he's fucking great  man  because he knows  he could just  come on here  maybe we could  get him for some  more  they said during  the summer  he's got a show  or something  or a book  oh great  and his publicist  loves us too  we weren't supposed 
[03:05:00]  to get him at all  today  yeah that was  very cool  he looks really  good though man  he looks really  healthy  he looks happy  and mentally  he looks in  good shape  he looks extremely  healthy  he really does  he looks like a guy  who is sober  and doing very well  which is nice  and we can't recommend  this show enough  it's fucking awesome  it's moving  you see a side to Tyson  this is what I would  love to ask you  but it was just so quick  about him being so silly  on sale  he really is silly  and just like the goofy 
[03:05:30]  guy you're listening to  now  that's his personality  yeah  when he was fighting  the first thing we learned  about Mike Tyson  is he's an animal  attack dog  when he would  fucking bolt out  of that corner  and just pound  the person  and knock him out  that's all you knew  so the whole story  that built up around  that was  that was all you knew  of him  and then you realize  no this is a guy  that likes a good  funny dick joke  and fucking  goofing around  on the news  and shit like that  that kind of got lost  in the fact that  he was such a  great fighter 
[03:06:00]  yeah  a fighter  a Navy SEAL  Gary Busey  was out there  I guess he just  got here  why can't we get  Gary Busey  there's Gary right  there  yo Gary  he's doing  Shade 45 I think  can we get Gary Busey  in  open the door  we're going to get  yelled at  Roland and us  are going to get  yelled at  yo Gary  there he is  yo Gary  he's up against 
[03:06:30]  the door  there you go  we officially had  him on the show  there you go  he's going in  the shade first  he's pushing his  ass against the  window  he's pushing his  ass up  what a mental  patient  alright very good  I got Tyson to  sign my completed  Sudoku puzzle  what  someone's going to  be very happy  that's a good one  man  I might have to  frame this  that's  oh you're not  giving it away  that doesn't look 
[03:07:00]  like anything  that's Tyson  that's Mike Tyson  oh it's upside down  dude  oh yeah  people are going  to want that one  they will frame it  and hang it up  on their wall  at fucking home  no keep it  oh man  I'll give it away  if I get  give it away now  give it away  give it away  Busey was out there  though he goes  he was taking a photo  I guess for publicity  with Mike Tyson  yeah  and Kenny said  that he goes  grab my arm  as hard as you can  oh shit  why 
[03:07:30]  how'd that work  because they're weirdos  both of them  no no  Busey said that  to Tyson  did he grab his arm  I guess so  fuck  I guess we gotta go home  jeez  are you doing  Gary Busey  on the after show  yeah he's coming  by 10.30  I didn't know  he was gonna be here  at 10  nice  very cool  maybe I'll stay  what do you think  about that  you're allowed to  you're welcome  maybe I will stay  for Gary Busey  the Sam Roberts 
[03:08:00]  after show  gets  some big guests  great guests  you just had  Mike Tyson  in here  I don't know  that was a stop by  that was a stop by  that was just a stop by  that's just cause  he loves Sammy  but you know  I mean  David Chase  how is he  he's good  I mean he was  a little tough interview  but why  did you ask him  who killed  was Tony Soprano dead  I did  come in for a few  minutes  they're pointing  in here  oh yeah  I'll ask him  with a shape  to save their life  oh okay 
[03:08:30]  cause he's standing  outside  he's a mental  case  he's  retarded  are they trying  to get him in  oh are they  here he comes  fucking Gary  coming yeah  there he is  hey there Gary  what's up Gary  you're all coming  back  who's who  yeah  well I'm Jim Norton  obviously  that's Sam  and that's Anthony  Anthony  what's up  Anthony  Jim Norton  Jim  Sam  Gary  Sam

[03:10:00]  fucking wordplay  humor  or I would have said  yeah opie  what's he  in Mayberry  or something  he would have  cracked up  hey Gary  where you from  Indiana  Gary Indiana  fuck yeah  it's funny  it's good  alright look  I'd love to fucking  sit here with all you guys  stay for Gary Busey  what  no that ain't happening  he's doing shade  yeah  yeah  I'll listen on the way home  it'll be great  absolutely  David Chase was in here 
[03:10:30]  at like  1.30  one afternoon  or something  I got him for the Sunday show  not the after show  if it was a Tuesday  or a Thursday  I would stay  you gotta do your shit  Monday  I'm staying  for Gary Busey  you kinda have to  are ya  yeah  for Gary Busey  sure  yeah  he's a maniac  he kept  talking about  Mechanical Dog  last night  on Celebrity Apprentice  what  he got  so fired  last night  but he argued  man  and Trump  loves him  yeah  like the other 
[03:11:00]  contestants  all get so frustrated  cause they go  he goes  who's the worst  player on your team  every time  they go  Gary  and he goes  well Gary's  kind of a genius  isn't he  and they're like  no  we just want you  to fire Gary  he's a fucking lunatic  is what he is  that guy's crazy  um  he's got  like does he give  coherent interviews  like or is it just  you say something  and he just  goes on with what he said  like there's three rules  to work with me  we're gonna find out today 
[03:11:30]  hopefully he's brought  some Busey-isms with him  oh I  I don't doubt it  Sam  it would be my pleasure  for you to give away  the Mike Tyson  science  you can't like  talk about  like the Buddy Holly  story that he was in  when he was an actor  no I mean you could  talk about it  but will you get  any answers  yeah yeah Buddy Holly  Dee Snyder says  that uh  he  cause he was on  Celebrity Apprentice 2  uh huh  and Dee Snyder said  that Gary Busey  is now under the impression  whatever movie he did  he thinks he actually  did that  what do you mean 
[03:12:00]  so like if he was  in Buddy Holly  oh he thinks  he actually was  Buddy Holly  he thinks he was  if he was in a  if he was a fighter pilot  in a movie  he thinks that he  has experience  being a fighter pilot  oh okay  nothing wrong with that  you could get a double  signed Opie Sudoku puzzle  too  from Gary Busey  Gary Busey  Opie and Mike Tyson  no no no no  no  no  just Tyson and you  do you guys want to  sign this one too  no  it's a big  it's a big get  it's not my bit  yeah but they might want it

[03:26:30]  like past  Butch Patrick's table  but Butch Patrick  was just sitting there  talking to  like one dude  for 20 minutes  bored  and like just  there was nobody  there for him  fuck yeah  what do you mean  fuck yeah  I would've just  played some of my  fucking music  yeah  they have bands  out there  I'm surprised  SFPs  actually I'm not  surprised at all  that SFPs  haven't been  yeah they were like  come play your new  song  the devil's circus  that's the name  of your song  fuck yeah 
[03:27:00]  you think that's  cool  how does it go  it goes like  you play the  circus music  with an electric  guitar  as if it's  like cool  Dan in  Chicago  hey Sam  how you doing  what's up buddy  hey I got a  suggestion for  eating that  running shark  to get a  hoot kid in  there and do  taste without  that won't  out  it would taste 
[03:27:30]  better  alright Dan  that wasn't  funny  luckily Gary  Busey's  coming  terrible idea  that was  you didn't  see him on  celebrity  apprentice  this season  no  I haven't  seen him  since Carney  so what do  you want to  ask him  about  Gary  Busey  he's a wonderful  actor  yeah he's  awesome  Gary  Busey  wherever you want  you're the guest  we're on the air  now  Sam how are you  how are you  Gary  yes good to  see you buddy  you have a 
[03:28:00]  great memory  yeah I do  that's what  happens when  you have  massive brain  surgery and  go to the  other side  after you  die  did you go  to the  other side  yeah  what did  it look  like  it's like  explaining an  orgasm to a  10 year old  amazing  just  indescribable  amazing  wow  dynamic  did you know  where you were  when it was  happening or no  what  did you know  you had gone  over when you  went over  oh yeah  I was only  about a foot  long and a  quarter of an  inch wide  and that's the 
[03:28:30]  size of your  soul and your  soul is housed  in the column  of your spine  that's where  you're so  explain to me  do you see  your soul  are you your  soul I don't  understand  you're everything  you are but  you don't see  it you feel  it and I was  surrounded by  angels that  look like almost  the size of a  volleyball and  they were gold  amber light  white light and  they were moving  like they were  breathing and  the love and  the trust and  the truth of an  angel is so 
[03:29:00]  powerful you can't  look the light  right in the eye  without going to  your prone  position on the  floor with love  and respect and  there were three  lights in front of  me and the light  on the left was  abalone and  mother of pearl  colored and out  of that light came  an androgynous  voice that spoke  to me in thought  in thought  in thought  yeah it said  I can't  impersonate it  because my gosh  he said you're  in a beautiful  place  you are 
[03:29:30]  going in the  right direction  but for the  responsibility you  have coming up  in you  you must look for  help in the  spiritual realm  you may come  with us now  or you can  return to your  body and  continue your  destiny  you had the  choice  it's your  choice  wow  and bam  I came back  immediately but  I was still  recovering from  brain surgery  and a friend of  mine Joan  Culpepper  God bless her  said go see  the movie  Ghost  with Patrick 
[03:30:00]  Swayze and  Demi Moore  I said why  she said an  essence will come  from your  subconscious to  your conscious  and you realize  you are not in  a dream  so I saw the  movie when I  saw the white  lights around  Patrick  and I saw  the at the  end of the  movie I  started crying  from down  deep  because it  matched what  you saw  it told me  where I was  right  my friend  said are  you okay  I said yeah  I'm really  okay because  I have been 
[03:30:30]  there  wow  were you  tempted to  go because  people a lot  of people say  they want to  go over but  they're sent  back  no what you  do you react  only to the  truth and the  truth you react  to instantly  without thought  so whatever  is supposed to  happen whatever  is right in  that moment  either going  there or coming  back you make  the right decision  they told me I  had a choice  and you don't  you don't think  this is because  people say that  sometimes experiences  like this are  chemical reactions  from the drugs  that you're under  no I was on  no drugs I  went off a 
[03:31:00]  Harley Davidson  going 40 miles  an hour without  a helmet and  hit on a curb  at Washington  Robertson Boulevard  in Culver City  California and  split my skull all  the way to the  top and knocked  a hole in my  skull  about as big  as a 50 cent  piece  and that's  where you  started  and immediately  you're out  and that's  where you  started seeing  this stuff  my memories  would not  consolidate  for four and  a half weeks  because the  right side of  my skull  and brain  were dormant  wow  and so now 
[03:31:30]  now is your  thought process  different than  it was before  like are you  aware of like  my brain is  functioning  differently  than it was  before  it's functioning  differently  it's been  altered to a  great place  like right  now  I forgot  everyone's  names and  I don't  know where  I am  no  that's  funny now  yeah  yeah  yeah  oh no  it's  it's magic  it's a miracle  and blessing  after you've  been there  and come  back  that you  have knowledge  of things  that haven't  happened yet 
[03:32:00]  you have  feelings of  things that  are coming  in a  prophetic  way  and you  know a  deja vu  is when  your mind  picks up  something faster  than your  brain  and you feel  like you've  been there  before  you've seen  this before  you've lived  this before  what I had  after brain  surgery was  a vuja day  and that  was  I would  see things  and although  I knew  I had seen  it but first  it was like  the first time  I was seeing  it  so  has it  affected your 
[03:32:30]  memory at all  because when  you act  you have to  memorize roles  and parts  and all these  things and has  it affected  you negatively  that way  or has it  kind of helped  no negativity  at all  I'm happy  to say  what about  the way  you're shown  on Celebrity  Apprentice  and reality  shows you've  been on  you're the  star of the  show  but a lot  of it is  you know  they kind of  make a joke  out of a lot  of  out of  what you do  oh they tried  to but it  doesn't work  you don't  think so  oh no  I know so  yeah  how do you  feel  do you watch  the show  yeah  after you  I mean  after you've  done it  you go back 
[03:33:00]  and watch  the episode  oh yeah  how do you  feel about  how do you  feel about  the way  it is  shown on  TV  as opposed  to what  you lived  through  I like it  there were  some things  edited out  of last  night's show  like what  and last night  I was fired  oh when  Ben Gillette  said oh  the mechanical  dog will be  great it'll  be comedy  chaos and  then we'll  go back  to LG  phone  I said  okay  but  because in  the show  I don't  know if  you saw  it Jim  but they  had to  make videos  promoting LG  the phone  company  and I was  doing that  but I had  no support  from Penn 
[03:33:30]  or Lisa  they abandoned  me and  Ivanka  Donald's  daughter  busted  him on  the show  last night  and so  did Donald  Trump  not helping  you  not helping  me at all  they abandoned  me  Donald loves  you  and that  because I  talked to  the people  who have  been on  the show  I bet  you have  and it's  much to  their chagrin  because you  know I  talk to  them and  they go  on and  they you  see it  they're in  the boardroom  and Donald  goes who's  the weakest  player  every week  he says  that and  it was  Gary  because they  want to  get Gary  fired  but every  time 
[03:34:00]  Donald goes  well Gary's  kind of a  genius  isn't he  and they  know he's  not gonna  Gary Busey  is a different  kind of man  that's what  he says  yeah  why does  Donald love  you so  much  I pay  him  no no  no  it's just  a connection  of truth  honesty  sincerity  and stamina  it was last  night he said  Gary  from when you  were on here  two years  ago  you have  improved  so much  your solid  is a rock  yeah  because I  wouldn't let  anybody get  on top of  me  right 
[03:34:30]  there's a real  fascination  with Gary  Busey  it's like  you've become  this larger  than life  thing  it's more  than the  acting  it was  always the  acting  and then  something  happened  and it's  just people  like you  for who  you are  that's me  I'm surrounded  by angels  those angels  were giving  me information  to say  I'm not  thinking when  I say a lot  of that stuff  hi  when did  you  did you think  anybody on the  show was  specifically  dismissive of  you  because people  tend to be  oh Gary  he's doing  the Gary  Busey  stuff again  oh Penn  and Lisa  were they  wanted to  get me 
[03:35:00]  out of  there  oh so  they were  thinking  okay we  know we're  going to lose  this thing  let's just  get Gary  out  yeah  and that's  what happened  yeah well  what do you  say the end  oh my god  you are going  to be  pleasantly  surprised  were you  were you  pleasantly  surprised  I felt  like a  virgin  on prom  night  oh my  well  wonderful  that's a  good thing  very good  thing  as long as  it's successful  for him  yeah  some virgins  on prom  night  go home  alone  exactly  they're walking  no they don't  go home  alone  no  they don't  go home  alone  do you  they go home  after shampooing  somebody's puppy 
[03:35:30]  they didn't know  it  I don't know  what that means  Gary  figure it out  it'll come to  you later  alright  alright  do you like  do you like  the way things  are now  like with the  reality shows  and all that  stuff  or did you  kind of  do you  do you  miss your  anonymity  or your  privacy  oh no  I lost  that in  1979  after the  Buddy Holly  story  but that  doesn't bother  me at all  I refuse  to be bothered  and reality  shows  that's a joke  they're not  reality shows  right  I mean  you're given  a task  you're given 
[03:36:00]  a way  to go  you're given  a process  to go through  you go through  it and you  make the best  you know  one of my  favorite things  you ever did  was Jodie Foster  or Carney  oh yeah  is one of my  greatest memories  of you  is playing that  hey hey  I'm high  and I'm dry  I'm looking  for some bozo  to put me  in the water  yeah  Jodie Foster  and Robbie  Robertson  yeah you played  how would you  describe it  you were the  guy with  the dunk tank  clown  yeah it's  called the bozo  and they come  out  they hide  from the audience  because the 
[03:36:30]  audience wants  to come  beat that  you know  what out of  and so  I put on  makeup  and sneak  in the bozo  tango  they didn't  get knocked  in the water  once I'd  come out  of the water  and set  the seat  up and be  right back  on the seat  and say  I didn't fall  in I just  needed a drink  yeah  it was pretty  good it was  a lot of fun  where do the  abuse isms  when did they  start where  do they come  from years  ago I was  dealing with  my past  yeah  and I  couldn't get  over the  way I'd  been betrayed  what I let  happen to me 
[03:37:00]  what do you  mean I  stopped and  said  yeah I  stopped  my gosh  what I'm  doing I'm  living in  the past  so I said  where am I  now  now  now I'm  in the  now  so the  first  museum  was  now  which  stands for  no other  way  because that's  the way you  have to live  yeah  in the  now  the moment  of now  is the  most precious  moment you  have living  on earth  so you  everything you  see in your  life is a  reflection of  yourself so  reflect a good 
[03:37:30]  image of  yourself to  what you  see and  you will be  floating on  air and  the word  float f-l-o-a-t  stands for  feeling light  on air  today  so you  sitting at  home writing  these or  are you  sometimes spur  the moment  with this  stuff  who do  you need  we'll get  your person  Michael Conley  yeah he should  be in here  yeah where's  Michael  rolling could  you go get  Michael Conley  he's coming  in he was  just in the  other room  I want to  show you  uh  abusing

[03:38:30]  and that  stands for  feeling a  rectal  transmission  that's right  and that's  a bodily  function  which cannot  be denied  and there's  a picture  described  a photo  too  there's a  photo  of an  outhouse  with some  type of  a dust  which is  probably  a fart  coming  through  the roof  here you have  fun  if you win  finally  understanding  nothing  when you can  let go  and the note  is  you know  garybusey.com  you guys out there  if you said  request for  abuseism  to garybusey.com

[03:40:00]  protection  and speaking  through you  they will do  that  were you a  religious guy  before  the accident  my mother  and father  when I was  a young  boy  in Tulsa  Oklahoma  started me  going to  the Christian  church  and the  main thing  that I did  celebrity  apprentice for  was Kawasaki  disease  children's Kawasaki  disease  which happens  for children  between five  and five months  and five years  old  and it's no lab 
[03:40:30]  there's no lab  that can figure it out  and the symptoms  are puffy lips  a strawberry colored  tongue  high fever  for over five  days  a rash  and conjunctivitis  and when your  son  daughter  has that  a fever  for four days  take it right  to the doctor  and say  check  for Kawasaki  disease  and the  buceyfoundation.org  is where we're  receiving donations  from people  for recovery 
[03:41:00]  and research  on Kawasaki  disease  and all your  donations  will be  are tax  deductible  is it deadly  yeah  if you don't  get it in time  the heart  can have  palpitations  and go crazy  and  disabilitating  life  and or death  and that's  buceyfoundation.org  dot org  yeah  send a  send a donation  and you will  you will have  a legacy  of healing  children  that you can't  get anywhere else  are there things  about yourself  because you're  obviously  you're charity  oriented 
[03:41:30]  you care about  people  are there things  about you  that are out  there that  bother you  this misconception  about you  that people  think that  you know  is inaccurate  that's kind  of irritating  well yeah  the reputation  of still being  on drugs  and I haven't  been on drugs  in 18 years  and that was  cocaine  I OD'd on  cocaine  May the 3rd  1995  but that is  no more  and I don't  take things  personally  that people  say about me  negative  you know  no don't do  that that'll  waste your  energy  it's wasted  time  it's wasted 
[03:42:00]  effort  to write  something that  doesn't have  to be  righted  because it's  already  it's already  right  did you have  any experiences  when you  overdosed on  cocaine  yeah I had  a they gave  me a drug  to paralyze  my body  and had  me in the  on the  on the  on the table  in the form  of a Christian  cross  and there's  there's a  that was my  breath breathing  a tube they had 
[03:42:30]  in my throat  about as big  as an exhaust  pipe  and I came  back from  that and  went to  detox  and gone  that was  that was it  that's a part  of the devil  you don't want  to dance  with is drugs  and alcohol  and was that  it was a  methamphetamine  and crank and  crack and  book and  deke whatever  they're calling  them now  but was that  the moment  of just being  like the  scariness  of being  you know  your body's  paralyzed  from this  drug  you I just  never want  to be back  going  you did  yeah but  I wasn't  what did 
[03:43:00]  they give  you they  give you  like succinyl  choline or  something like  that to  totally paralyze  your body  did they  sexualize  my  choline  no  where are  you from  come on  Jim  that's what  I would  have done  you better  show me  your license  no I don't  know what  they gave  me what  they gave  me works  do you  when you're  on reality  TV and  you start  watching it  back do  you take  lessons away  from that  do you start  looking at  yourself differently  as if to  say  oh I  didn't know  that was  how I  was you  know being  perceived  oh no 
[03:43:30]  I'm running  the money  with my  truth  you know  you're very  self-aware  you find  yourself  yeah  and so  when you're  when you're  when you're  watching you  know whether  it's celebrity  rehab celebrity  apprentice and  somebody's saying  well Gary's  just being  Gary you  know when  it's happening  that that's  what they're  thinking  yeah it  doesn't matter  to me  I don't  take it  personally  and I  am what  I am  in a  truthful  unfiltered  not  self-conscious  no low  self-esteem  I'm just  being my  truth  and the  reason we're  on earth  living this 
[03:44:00]  life  is to find  the truth  of ourself  and when you  find the truth  of yourself  you become  your best  friend  without warning  and then  everything is  just beautiful  and God bless  everyone  isn't it difficult  for most  working actors  to be kind  of true to  themselves all  the time  because of  the politics  involved in  show business  well there's  all kinds  of temptations  and serious  confrontations  and issues  of insanity  that come  with art  but that's  what you get  when you buy  that dinner  you gotta be 
[03:44:30]  true to yourself  and be on  the line  of truthful  responsibility  just always  take advantage  of your  responsibilities  and consider  other people's  feelings  first  you do that  and start  every conversation  with a compliment  by the way  I did mean  to tell you  you look great  today  well thanks  did you get  the check  and you  you were  saying something  Sam didn't  mean to rudely  interrupt you  before but you  were making  you said  something about  betrayal  and you were  going to ask  about that 
[03:45:00]  like somebody  had betrayal  when you were  talking about  the abuse  isms  and I was  kind of wondering  how you were  betrayed  well that comes  with a personal  life factor  that I made  a bad choice  on  you know  there's been  some relationships  I've been in  that turned out  to be betrayed  it's all the  lessons  in life  you go through  life  making lessons  taking lessons  understanding them  following them  and the word  failing  f-a-i-l-i-n-g  stands for  finding an 
[03:45:30]  important lesson  inviting needed  growth  so in truth  you don't fail  you just find  a better way  to do it  when you look  at it that way  you're above  the radar  you're so far  above the radar  they don't know  where you're coming  from  so do you look  at that accident  as a weird  blessing then  because it  opens you up  absolutely  but do you  think  now  more than  before  do you think  you're easier  for somebody  to kind of  take advantage  of now  because you  have more  of a good  will  say that again  do you think  that now  since the accident  you come out  you have much 
[03:46:00]  more of a good  will  you're much  more truthful  to yourself  do you think  that makes  you easier  for somebody  to come  and take  advantage  of your  good nature  no  because you're  too keen  and aware  on what's  going on  and see what's  coming  right  and you  kind of  know  so you  know  when you're  doing these  shows  which ones  are the  bad apples  you can feel  it in their  insecurity  and that's what  you saw last night  with Lisa  and Penn  insecurity  and fear  when Ivanka  and Donald Trump  turned on them  wow  and they just  start attacking 
[03:46:30]  what  and they just  start attacking  I said  because they  like it's like  you know  you cornered me  they ignored me  they cut me out  they wouldn't help me  they wouldn't say  anything  the things you  heard Penn say  in the show  last night  it was a private  interview  he didn't come  to me with any  advice  or any  power  or any  strength  no he  he  abused himself  and so did  Lisa  by not following  through with what  the true course 
[03:47:00]  of a task is  which is  teamwork  teamwork  all you need  is teamwork  you still got the  music in your soul  the word team  T-E-A-M  that stands for  together  everyone achieves  more  and that's true  but it becomes  difficult because  people want the  credit  especially when  you're talking  about you know  impressing Donald  Trump  well I've  taken the word  difficult out of  my vocabulary  nothing is difficult  for this cowboy  no I guess not  now will you hold  a resentment  against people  like Penn or Lisa  who ignored you  like say the show  ends and you see them 
[03:47:30]  no I love everybody  I said that  I love them  I said it last time  I love them both  I love everyone  were you happy  to go home  I didn't go home  what happened  you'll see when  you watch the show  oh now we got  another little tease  are you coming back  there's what  I guess there's  five weeks left  am I coming back  yeah  you'll have to  watch and see  we definitely will  so what do you  like to do  when you're not  acting  what do you do  when you're totally  in your down time  and there's no 
[03:48:00]  cameras around  what do you enjoy  there's writing  I do  and there's  I'm doing  I'm recording now  I'm recording a CD  with some of Buddy Holly's songs  no one's heard before  and some that were in the movie  and take a Beatles song  a band song  and a Beach Boys song  one of my favorite groups  ever  in the world  yeah  that's what I'm doing now  music is the highest  art form of them all  and Steven Spielberg  proved that  at the end of 
[03:48:30]  Close Encounters  of the Third Kind  that is an intergalactic  communication value  music  sonic waves  pitches we can't even  hear on earth  yeah  go ahead  do you think that  you portray a guy  like Buddy Holly  who's such a legendary figure  and you look back on it  do you think  if he was alive  and he saw the way  I portrayed him  he would be very happy  with what I did  I know he was happy  because he was singing  through me in the movie  I didn't realize  after the movie was over 
[03:49:00]  when I came home  on December 30th  the day the movie  wrapped  in 78  I felt  a great spirit  of enthusiasm  and genius  had left me  that was Holly  huh  and you  so  because I  they didn't lip sync  his stuff  they didn't have  his  post his stuff  over you  oh no  that was me singing  I was singing  and playing  was that always  the intention  or was that something  that just kind of  happened during the  that was the intention  of the people  who did the movie  people from Philadelphia 
[03:49:30]  Steve Rash directed it  from Sulphur Springs  Texas  and boy  that union  that we had  was angelic  Steve and Rash  and I  yeah it's just  one of those  that was kind of  like the career  launching role  really  it seems like  that was the one  that kind of  set you on the  oh yeah  it was  had you done  Carney before that  or was that after  after  okay  how was meeting  Mike Tyson out here  we saw you out  in the hallway  meeting Mike Tyson  out here  we saw you out  in the hallway  snapping photos 
[03:50:00]  meeting your  Mike  fiance  no you've never  met my fiance  no a lot of people  are you engaged  to Mike  I'm not engaged  to Mike Tyson  I would love to be  he's a charismatic  guy but  yeah we're old buddies  are you  yeah  how'd you meet him  long ago  at Warner Brothers  we were there  for a publicity deal  and Michael and I  were taking a picture  and standing between  us was Bugs Bunny  and Michael said  to me  Gary  when you went  down that motorcycle  we were praying 
[03:50:30]  for you  we stopped boxing  and got on our knees  and prayed for you  I said thank you  Mike  God bless you  yeah yeah yeah  he's another guy  though like you  who kind of  has gone on  this spiritual journey  and the Mike Tyson  that we see now  is very different  from the one  many years ago  welcome to earth  yeah  is that what  yeah  it's called a reality  check I guess  that's my motto  for life  welcome to earth  you had a weird  situation a couple  weeks ago  on Celebrity Apprentice  it made me laugh  and I hope you 
[03:51:00]  don't take offense  to that  but when you were  talking to the  Board of Tourism  from South Africa  yeah  you kept mentioning  that you had heard  murders  when you were in  Johannesburg  I went to  Johannesburg  in South Africa  to make a movie  and I shouldn't  have said that  but that was my  reality to South Africa  but I moved  from Johannesburg  20 miles away  to Sandton City  and it's a beautiful  country with beautiful  people and beautiful  art  worked with the Zulu  and the Swahili  warriors  and learned how to 
[03:51:30]  kill lions  with a short spear  so be careful  when you come  at me growling  I'll get you  so you learned  how to throw them  or actually kill them  you don't throw them  you get down  okay he's demonstrating  get down like this  uh huh  the spear's about  that long  yeah  and when the lion  jumps you go  flam right here  you have to get him  in the throat  while he's jumping  at you  absolutely  so you make  yourself almost  a prey  you make yourself  a potential prey  for the lion  it's called bait  yeah but then  if you don't do 
[03:52:00]  the stick thing  right  yeah  he gets the bait  doesn't he  you might be  dancing with a lion  yeah  and you will not  be leading  yeah what if  your stick breaks  that would be  my feeling  that the weight  of the lion  would just  snap the stick  well you gotta  use your force  of your shoulders  and your arms  and your legs  and I like  touching you  I'm very touchable  people tell me  something mushy  about me  that just makes  people want to  see how I'm  you're like a little  sexual sponge  isn't that the first 
[03:52:30]  time you've been  described as  it certainly is  and there's no one  I would rather have  say it than  Gary Busey  to call me  we met many  many years ago  very briefly  you came to a show  I was opening  I was opening  for Dice Clay  in New Jersey  when you came  to the show  at the Rotten  Room or something  like that  Rascals  it's called  Rascals  are you a comedy  fan?  oh yeah  I mean my gosh  who are some  of your comics  that you're into?  who are some  of the comedians  that you like?  I like them all 
[03:53:00]  yeah yeah yeah  excuse me  what I appreciate  about Gary  is it's the same  thing he was  talking about  with the South  African Border  Tour  that's the truth  that comes out  maybe he will  realize at some  point  what now?  say that again  what I like  about you  oh good  is that at some  point you'll  realize  you know  maybe mentioning  to the Johannesburg  people that you  had seen murders  there was not  the right thing  to say at the  time but in  that moment  that's what you  associated with  Johannesburg  you saw Jim  over there 
[03:53:30]  and what did  you associate  with him?  being a sexual  sponge  you know what I  mean?  you say  look at this guy  what the truth  is  we need to get  some shirts  that say  sexual sponge  would you do  that maybe  sexual  sponge  yeah sexual  sponge across  the front  maybe a new  twitter handle  or something  I kind of like  that  there's a lot  of things  that can happen  I think it'd  be good  sexual sponge  twitter's this  and you're  and you're  and you're just  Gary Busey on  twitter  are you the real  Gary Busey  because I've  seen a lot  of fake  Gary Busey  this is the  Gary Busey  the Gary Busey  on twitter  yeah follow me  man I got some 
[03:54:00]  funny things to  say without  conscience  and you do  your own thing  you do your  own twitter  as opposed to  a lot of  celebrities who  don't do  their own  twitter at  all  oh yeah I  do my own  thing constantly  and consistently  and reverently  and good  yeah I mean I  don't think  there's any  doubt about  that I  don't think  Gary would  allow somebody  to send  something out  to the internet  that said  it was under  his name  I got a  question for  you  yes  what do  you get  when you  cross a  raggedy  and all  right  with a  pillsbury  doughboy  what's that  your little  short fat 
[03:54:30]  ugly redhead  with a yeast  infection  well Gary  on that  note  we're out  of time  I know  how to  get out  of this  shit  so keep  watching  Celebrity  Apprentice  right  cause  yeah  yeah keep  watching it  cause  you'll have  fun next  week  even though  I'm not  on the  show  you'll have  fun seeing  the others  scramble  sink  and drown  Gary Busey  thank you so  much  we'll talk  to you again  soon  God bless
