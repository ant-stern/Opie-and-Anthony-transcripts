<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a detailed recounting of their elaborate prank targeting Howard Stern's SiriusXM launch event in Union Square.  This involved hundreds of supporters in Opie & Anthony shirts and coordinated actions, including the use of walkie-talkies, large placards, and a van playing music.  They described the chaos, their close proximity to a visibly annoyed Stern, and the media coverage, noting the Associated Press's inaccurate reporting of the event's location. The prank even extended to Stern's appearance on David Letterman, where they repeated their actions, forcing Stern to acknowledge them on air.  Technical difficulties plagued the broadcast, particularly with playing audio clips and isolating a specific track from a CD.

The show included numerous listener calls, one detailing a bizarre encounter with Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci, and another complaining about the weight of a promotional Howard Stern-signed radio. Listeners also discussed Stern's apparent nervousness during his Letterman appearance, which the hosts attributed to their prank.  They declared an "all-out assault on the media," encouraging listeners to participate in similar actions. The conversation frequently devolved into sexually explicit territory, including discussions of morning sex and a caller's reluctance to participate in an on-air sex-related segment.  Other off-topic discussions included anecdotes about a book ("Rent Boys") causing internal friction, a recurring bit about midget sightings, and a song dedicated to Howard Stern, punctuated by ad-reads and appearances from "Club Soda Kenny" and "Master Poe."

The broadcast then segued into crude humor about overweight women, followed by a discussion of a Congressional hearing on pornography and the pervasiveness of porn online.  The hosts chanted "Internet is more porn,"  discussed their pornography preferences (favoring amateur content), and promoted a website, "Flash Your Rack.com," engaging in a playful, crude description of its content and user interactions, even attempting to access content based on listener ratings. A listener prank call involving "Hi, Mom" created temporary tension before the joke's reveal. A stockbroker caller was aggressively insulted, followed by a commercial break.  A story about Jimmy Norton's illness after encountering a sticky substance on a banana was shared.  The hosts revisited their media coverage, specifically a Forbes article labeling them "insufferable, but inarguably popular," and continued discussing pornography websites with listeners. A black male caller discussed his Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity experience, leading to a discussion about race and racism, including racially charged jokes. The segment concluded with a call from a woman claiming to be Carmen Electra, who participated in a "Guess What's in My Pants" segment involving sexually suggestive descriptions of her masturbation.

A subsequent segment centered around the "Guess What's in My Pants" game with a remote go-go dancer, Carmen,  featuring absurd and accurate guesses, punctuated by Jimmy Norton's flatulence.  A call with Robert Kelly promoting his show followed.  The hosts discussed a cringe-worthy video involving poker chips and a woman, and continued banter about Norton's flatulence.  A caller criticized Norton for disrupting segments.  The conversation shifted to stories about Colin Quinn, a USO lady, a porno actress, and the hosts' anxieties, particularly Opie's insecurity regarding Norton.  There was an extended discussion about body hair and Norton's exhibitionism. Further calls, including one defending Norton, and a listener's story about childhood sexual experiences, were featured.  The segment included mentions of the song "Monster Rain" and more anecdotes about Norton.

The final segment featured a guest, Bob Kelly, who shared extremely graphic and sexually explicit anecdotes about his childhood sexual experiences, including detailed descriptions of mutual masturbation and a sexual encounter with a developmentally disabled girl.  The hosts reacted with a mix of shock, laughter, and incredulity. The conversation included sexually suggestive tangents and listener calls sharing their own sexually explicit "what I learned today" stories, all interspersed with XM radio commercials.

[00:08:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Hello.  What's going on, Anthony?  I'm awake.  We are the pioneers of satellite radio.  Pioneers.  Like old Ma and Pa going cross country in the covered wagon.  We were the first ones to head out into the wild west. 
[00:08:30]  The first ones.  Let's all remember that.  The first ones.  Other people would like to believe that they're the first.  They'd like to rewrite history.  Put their own little spin on it.  They're still spewing their shit.  But, hey, you can't deny the truth in history.  What a glorious day, Anthony.  I think yesterday was the day that XM finally understood what Opie and Anthony are about. 
[00:09:00]  I think we all came together yesterday, and it's only going to get better from here.  Came together as a team.  Right.  And showed people what kind of assholes we can be.  Right.  Exactly.  But first, we've got to go to Cleveland and say hi to Russ.  What's up, Russ?  Because I agree with this guy, actually.  Go ahead, Russ.  Like you said, the St. Pat stuff is old.  So why not add some of the sexiest day stuff at the beginning?  That way, if the show does go a little homo, at least it was head row at one point. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, I'm sick of the St. Pat's thing.  So am I.  And we start the show with the news clips over and over and over again.  I do believe we've got to keep that fresh.  Yeah, let's get rid of that.  Let's just get rid of that, Steve, okay?  We're done with that.  And what, put something from the show?  Yeah.  We'll come up with something new.  Something sexy?  Something sexy?  How about this call, Russ?  Yeah, what are you wearing?  This call's real sexy. 
[00:10:00]  This fucking show got so gay this week, I swear to God.  Monster Rain, what the fuck?  It really is.  Well, the Monster Rain is funny.  I mean, that's funny.  It's hilarious, but it's very gay.  There you go.  Thanks.  All right.  Well, we'll bring the sex back into the show.  The sexiness.  We said yesterday we need some women to do some stuff because it's gotten way too gay.  Yeah, girls.  Well, we had an attempt yesterday.  It just didn't pan out.  No, the...  It really did.  The lady getting banged in the trailer there. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, Texas making its bid for sexy estate, and the woman calls up, and her phone sucked.  We couldn't really get a good audio of her and her husband, I guess, which was with her  in the truck.  It really didn't pan out.  I was hoping it would have sexied up the show a little bit.  It sure would have.  Washed that gay right out of our show.  Washed that gay right out of your hair.  Out of our show.  But no.  Well, you know what?  There's always today.  We can try again.  We're going to try again today. 
[00:11:00]  We need a couple to try to become the sexiest state in America.  We got Sacramento.  They're leading the way.  California is the sexiest state in America as we speak, okay?  We've hit a dry spell.  Oh, boy, did we hit a dry spell.  I think it does have to do with the fact that the show's gotten gay.  And it has everything to do with this...  Oh, Jesus.  Stupid buck.  No, it doesn't.  Falling off the console.  Yeah, and you better watch getting on the console.  I see Jimmy just look down at one of the pillars that are holding this thing up. 
[00:11:30]  This is unlike any studio I've ever been in.  State-of-the-art.  Yeah.  Brand-new equipment.  Very modern.  It's not that old wooden FM radio-type studio.  There's like a huge granite tabletop that is just giant.  This thing is probably 12 feet long by about 10 feet wide.  Yeah.  It's just really big and very heavy.  I was going to say it kind of looks like what?  An amoeba.  I was going to say an amoeba. 
[00:12:00]  It's a big amoeba.  I was going to say an amoeba.  Very good.  A big stone amoeba.  Yeah.  And it's being held up by metal pillars.  Huge metal pillars.  Yeah, metal pillars.  That are about 18 inches across, right?  No.  Unfortunately, that might help.  But isn't the one over there, is it?  No.  These ones that I got over here are probably about...  Eight inches?  Maybe eight to ten.  Okay.  And there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  I don't know.  There's about a half dozen of them or so.  Maybe eight. 
[00:12:30]  And some of them...  Here's the point, people.  Thanks for sticking around.  Some of them are starting to tip over.  Yeah.  And we were...  Jimmy was getting a little nervous yesterday that perhaps a stripper or someone will get  up here to give us a little show, a wiffle ball bat challenge, and this whole thing will  collapse on top of us.  It's going to happen.  And you know why...  So when you just got up on the console, I was getting a little shaky.  Oh, okay.  You know why it's tilted like that?  Because of that lesbian action we had in front of us that one day.  I don't think this thing is built...  All that humping was just moving the pillars. 
[00:13:00]  It's not built for humping and munching and girls just squirming around on it.  They didn't take that into consideration when they were building this state-of-the-art  studio for us.  No, they didn't.  All right.  What's up, Jimmy Norton?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Very tired.  There he is.  You're sleepy again.  Everybody is tired.  I got eight hours like last night.  I was tired yesterday.  I got an hour and 40 minutes last night.  Two hours.  I'm tired today.  That's great.  Girl trouble?  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Just a painter and she left. 
[00:13:30]  No trouble at all.  Yeah, no.  No problem.  You look really tired.  I walked in today really, really pumped and everyone is walking around like zombies because  they had a tough two days.  Eric Sexbagel never went home.  He's sleeping in the new office, which is just about built.  We can now live in there.  Yes.  I started hanging out in there this morning.  Were you hanging out?  Was no one else in there, though?  So you just kind of sat on the couch, looked around and said,  Well, we really don't need this office.  I know.  It's kind of true. 
[00:14:00]  Isn't that awful for the people that work their asses off to get it done?  Yeah, I guess this is the point where we tell you guys,  You know what?  I don't think we need an office.  Hey, you know?  Come to think of it, we really don't need that office.  I think you could use that space for something better.  We are true assholes.  All the bitching we do about things.  Yeah.  And then we get it and we're like,  You know, we don't need that really.  But thanks.  Thanks for giving it to us.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Don't be horrible like that.  Now get to work by clearing all the cubicles out so you can build more stuff that we don't need. 
[00:14:30]  Well, that will use.  Because it's all about us.  It is.  We're selfish, greedy little asses that just want, want, want and give minimum in return.  I got to tell you, man, I'm in a great mood today.  A lot of people would think, you know, that we'd be in a bad mood today, but no.  A lot of things happened yesterday and we just proved that we're real big assholes.  I tell you.  And it makes me feel really good.  It was a lot of fun and it felt like old times. 
[00:15:00]  Really quick, because I don't want to bore the rest of the country,  our old boss, Mel Karmazin, signed with the little doggie company.  You know, that's great for Howie and that's it.  Yeah.  You know, Mel used to know how to do radio, but then it turned out he knew how to take care of Howie and that's it.  That's all he knows how to do.  He knew the corporate end of radio and without getting into boring details,  the corporate side of radio is what really ruined broadcast radio.  The reason satellite radio is really taking off is because of people like Mel Karmazin and the commercialization of regular radio, 
[00:15:30]  the 18 minutes of commercials, the don't talk, just play the music, just play the same songs over and over again.  This was all Mel and that corporate mindset that came into FM radio.  Opie would talk a lot about old FM radio and the fact that these guys are just stone jocks that would come in,  smoke their weed, play what they wanted to play. 
[00:16:00]  It was hip.  It was cool to listen to.  And then when corporate got a hold of this and realized they could make money off of it,  they squeezed out everything that was spontaneous, fun, entertaining to listen to  and replaced it with long commercials, the same music that tests well in surveys,  and it opened up the door for satellite radio to become something new, something spontaneous, something fun.  And now they just hired the guy that pretty much, you know, was responsible for making FM radio suck. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, I got a lot of email.  I'm not bummed.  I am so happy to be with XM Satellite Radio.  It's simple as that.  It's the better company.  They have the better technology.  We have the better programming.  We have the better geeks.  You know, we do.  We're the king of the geeks, I think.  You know, these guys, we might have to beat them into submission about understanding the type of show we do,  but with a soldering iron, they kick ass.  That's right.  And a circuit board, these guys kill. 
[00:17:00]  You know, the reason the little dog company hired Mel was to cuddle and, you know, take care of Whiny Howie.  That's it.  That's it.  Because Whiny Howie needs Mel.  That's as simple as that.  He needs his daddy.  But no one is great today, I got to tell you.  We fucked with Howard so bad yesterday, and we don't have to go into an office and get yelled at.  We don't have to start getting memos and phone calls from lawyers saying, look, we're putting a gag order on you guys,  and if you do it again, we're going to fire you.  We'd have been creamed.  Not only are we going to fire you, we're going to sue you for every penny that we gave you thus far because you're hurting the company. 
[00:17:30]  No one is going to fuck with us anymore.  No.  And we just took care of business yesterday in a big freaking way.  In a big way.  In the olden days, if we'd have pulled what we pulled yesterday, we'd have been staring at that silver fox's tanned face in that office and just getting reamed.  Reamed.  But it was fun.  It was like I truly felt like I was part of Animal House's Delta House during the parade. 
[00:18:00]  Wasn't it?  It felt like that.  Just a bunch of, a collection of complete assholes fucking with stuff.  We gathered a bunch of misfits.  Misfits?  It was like the first army that they put together back in like 1775.  Just a bunch of misfits getting together to screw with things.  There was two things going on.  It reminded me of the parade scene in Animal House,  and it also kind of reminded me and made me realize how easy it is to shoot a president. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, my God.  And I'm talking about an ex-president because if you say that, you know, then you get arrested.  But I'm obviously talking about the JFK assassination.  I'm like, oh, my God.  This is a breeze.  It really is frightening.  I'll tell you this much.  No, we're going to tell you everything.  Yeah.  We probably had two days of really bad radio because we could care less about our radio show.  We want to fuck with the Little Doggy Company, and we succeeded yesterday.  It was a lot of fun. 
[00:19:00]  We succeeded.  You are talking to the Puppet Masters.  Puppet Masters.  There are walkie-talkies involved.  The NYPD was involved.  Oh, yeah.  People that worked for the Little Doggy Company were involved.  You see, when you don't pay your employees, when you owe them like paychecks that go back three or four months,  guess what?  They're going to help the competition out.  You think Mel will get paid on a regular basis,  or you think the powers that be over there will hold back his check for three months?  It was hilarious. 
[00:19:30]  There is.  Ben, comment.  Good luck.  Good luck.  I got three friends that are working over there that haven't been paid in months.  Well, you know something?  I could guarantee this.  The people that aren't being paid won't have to worry about being paid anymore  because they will be fired because they are not important enough to be around.  One thing that Mel has shown over the years also with radio,  he knows how to get one guy to do the job of five people.  Yeah.  One guy.  Just ask some of the general managers over at Infinity Broadcasting about Mel's grand plan. 
[00:20:00]  He will take you and have you programming and managing five stations.  You will be like poor Ken Stevens on planes, trains, and automobiles just wandering the United States  trying to keep track of five radio stations at once.  Four, by the way, the same pay he got.  They don't give you a raise or a promotion.  You get the same pay, and you have to then manage five stations.  And you know what the end result of that type of management is? 
[00:20:30]  Sex for Sam.  You can't manage five different stations from five different locations.  But that's what Mel does.  So you will see a lot of people getting their asses thrown out the door over there.  And because they listen to us over there at the Little Doggy Company,  because when we were interviewing with those guys, they all had XM radios in their offices.  So they are definitely listening to us today, especially because of what we did yesterday.  Listen, to all the people that are going to get fired the next two or three months,  do not call me. 
[00:21:00]  I don't want anything to do with you.  Ooh.  All of you.  That's right.  You too.  All of you.  Hey, how you doing?  All of you.  It's been a while.  Yeah.  Oh, serious?  No.  No.  Well, no, it was mutual.  I felt it was time to move on.  Yeah.  Hey, is there anything going on over at XM?  Maybe a...  I can give you a guaranteed list of people that are going to get fired very, very soon.  A guaranteed list.  And none of you guys should call us, because I will not pick up the phone. 
[00:21:30]  Earl?  Even though he doesn't work there?  Earl doesn't work there.  They should fire him anyway.  So we've got to go back.  We've got to go back about two days.  We had a lot of decisions to make, and I think we pulled it off perfectly.  Yes.  Because we really didn't know how strong the O&A Army is these days.  I mean, we're going to be honest with you.  We've been off the radio for two years, two years and four months.  We don't know what kind of pull we have out there these days.  We know we'll have a huge pull again.  And it's very difficult just being on satellite radio. 
[00:22:00]  At this point in satellite radio, we are the pioneers.  This is the fledgling industry, brand new.  And it's not like broadcast radio where we can hop on and get the word out to millions of people in one clip.  Right.  It just doesn't happen that way.  We're building.  We didn't want to take that chance.  We're underground big time still, and I think we did a pretty good job considering.  Oh, yeah.  I think we even hired homeless people to help us out.  I have no idea who those people were that were helping out. 
[00:22:30]  I did see a hell of a lot of hot girls.  Oh, yeah.  Where did they come from?  They're all walking past me at one point, just a line of them, a huge line of these hot, young, very young girls.  And they're walking past with Opie and Anthony shirts on and everything.  And I look, and I'm like, hi.  I don't even know if they knew who I was.  Right.  They're totally involved.  Yeah.  They're dedicated, ready to take a bullet for the team.  We recruited from the high schools, I believe.  Was it the high schools or junior high schools? 
[00:23:00]  See, this is the difference between us and Hoo-Hoo.  We are completely motivated, and you don't want to play this game.  You don't have it in you anymore.  Trust me.  This is just the beginning.  Yeah.  You have no idea.  We're into the guerrilla warfare.  You have no idea how connected we are in this city.  We had the NYPD helping us out yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  And they were supposed to be helping you out.  They didn't.  Yeah, the cops were...  We had people from your new company helping us out.  Okay?  Yeah.  We had assigned killers. 
[00:23:30]  Assigned killers.  Oh, yeah, we did.  Yeah, we did.  Yes, we did.  So it goes back about two days ago.  You know, we get the word that Howie's going to do his little thing down there in Union Square.  We're like, all right, well, we're going to rain on his parade.  Simple as that.  Because that's what we do.  We're assholes.  We know that now.  We finally figured that out.  We're assholes.  You know?  It's not about us being bitter or any of that stuff.  Look, Anthony and I make a great living.  Anthony and I are pretty popular.  We're known all over the country.  It's not about that. 
[00:24:00]  It's about Anthony and I being assholes.  It was fun.  And I literally go home and whack off after something like that happened yesterday.  Just thinking about how much of a dick I am and I just whack it and whack it and whack it.  It was a truly asshole move.  It was one of those futile efforts that only we know how to pull off.  So we find out he's going down to Union Square.  We're like, all right, we're going to fuck him up.  All right.  So we got with Washington. 
[00:24:30]  And I'm going to be honest with you.  We called Washington and I was a little scared.  I didn't know what they were about.  I didn't know.  Yeah, it was one of those things where this could be done with the help of Washington and  XM, but they kind of need a good understanding of what we're all about and how much assholes  we want to be.  And we weren't quite sure if they knew how to do that, quite frankly.  But they came to the table big time.  Yes, they did.  They had hundreds of shirts made. 
[00:25:00]  Recruited from the junior high school.  They recruited from the junior high school.  From the all-girls school.  They got most of their staff from Washington to come on up.  I mean, there are hundreds of people involved.  Hundreds.  Yep.  Okay.  Hundreds just in the crowd.  And then just people at vantage points all over Union Square.  Behind the scenes.  It was hilarious.  They sent the van out behind me.  Took a day off to come on up and drive the van. 
[00:25:30]  We had walkie-talkies.  We had porn playing.  We'll explain all the details.  But there was a point where I was in the bathtub with Jim Norton.  Yeah.  And another gentleman.  I have no idea who he was.  I was sitting on a ledge laughing my ass off.  Laughing my ass off.  Drinking a beer.  Just enjoying everything unfold below us.  You know what it was?  It was like an interactive video game.  Yeah.  It was like an interactive video game.  We were watching from above and coordinating and watching people coordinate. 
[00:26:00]  And it was fun to see the little delay in when you give an order and watch the troops move to a certain location.  You know, Howie, when you walked into your big, stretch, black Escalade limo thing, even though you're trying to make believe you're still the common man?  You know when the big, huge cartoon Opie and Anthony faces were right against the window?  Guess who called that strike in from above, you ass?  To the Hamptons, Escalade. 
[00:26:30]  I'm done here.  My work is finished.  Yeah, nice promotion, by the way.  You basically made people wait for hours.  And it's not, they gave out free radios, but the free radios are, first of all, it's old equipment.  Second of all, it's worth nothing.  You have to pay $150 to turn the thing on because you've got to get a year's subscription.  Get this, this is what they gave away.  Now, read between the lines here. 
[00:27:00]  Well, you don't even have to.  Gave away these coupons for subscriptions for Sirius.  They expire in like a week.  The coupons expire.  So you have to use them in order to get this free year's subscription.  They expire in four days.  Okay, four days.  Pretty much by Monday.  And it's a year's subscription.  So what you'll get is free Sirius up until about a month before Howard hits the air.  So you're not, you're down there for Howie. 
[00:27:30]  He's telling you you're going to get free radio and free Sirius.  But then he gives you something where you won't even be able to listen to him.  The subscription that you get for free will expire before he hits the air.  No, you don't even get the, you have to pay for the year.  You just got the radio.  Oh, but you got to pay for an extra extended subscription.  You just got the radio.  You have to now, within four days, call up and buy a year subscription.  So all those people waiting in line for four hours so they can hand over $150 to Sirius. 
[00:28:00]  That's what it comes down to.  So we go with Washington.  There was huge conference calls.  The CEO's in on it.  Even though he's busy raising money and working on the latest technology for XM Satellite Radio,  he's pumped and juiced.  Was he in the lab?  I have a whole new attitude toward XM Satellite Radio.  I'm telling you.  You've got a new attitude?  The last two days were the turning point.  I'm telling you.  Oh.  The turning point.  So we decide that we're just going to completely disrupt the proceedings there. 
[00:28:30]  Have a little fun with it.  Throw that little wrench into the works.  We had a minimum of 100 people in Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio shirts.  We gave away, I don't know, thousands and thousands of wow stickers.  Yeah.  T-shirts we were throwing out to the crowd.  And then we had these huge placards that had our faces on it.  You couldn't miss them.  Yeah, they were yellow and black.  They dwarfed the tiny little doggy freaking signs they had in the audience.  Yeah, they were very visible. 
[00:29:00]  So after the show yesterday, we were barely paying attention because we were taking phone calls during commercial breaks.  We were like, okay, the van's here.  We're hiding that.  You know, all right, we've got the hotel room in the W Hotel.  It's going to be on the sixth floor, room 605, if anyone's paying attention at home.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Go to room 605 someday and see how perfect it was for us.  Perfect.  Yeah, it was a great corner room with windows that overlooked the event.  All right, you guys, your car's arriving at 1015.  It's going to have tinted windows. 
[00:29:30]  It's going to take you, Anthony, and Jim Norton down to Union Square.  We need, like, Mission Impossible music.  Yeah, we need all sorts of fun music because this was great.  During the planning phase.  While they're finding the music, how about all of the homeless people that were online to get the free radios we were just talking about?  Right.  This is hysterical.  You would think it would be a bunch of Stern fans that had come down there.  But when the word got out that he was giving away free radios, they filled up a penned-in area first.  And that area was the people that were getting these free radios. 
[00:30:00]  Not yet.  Back when we do the planning.  Yeah, man.  Jesus.  I wish we had control of this over here.  No kidding.  Yeah, someone has the music cue at the wrong time.  Well, tough shit.  We're not going gay today.  All right, I'm just saying for Monday.  I'm taking the show back over, Jim.  We allowed you to take over the show for a while.  And quite frankly, we weren't too impressed with your gay radio.  So they penned in this area.  And then you start noticing a trend in the penned-in area for the people that are waiting to get their free radios. 
[00:30:30]  They're not like the fans that you would assume would come down there to get it.  It was every homeless guy, every street hustler that you see hawking their wares on the street, filling up this pen.  And that's who got these things.  Because after it was done, they're carrying them away and trying to sell them.  They were on the streets trying to sell these things.  Hey, man, you want to buy a radio?  Like, what?  Yeah, I got...  And you know he has no clue about subscription and stuff. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, this pick up AM, FM, or QM.  CD, radio.  Any kind of AM you need.  AM radio.  Yo, what's your name, man?  You could talk to Pluto on this thing.  I was talking to my friend in Chicago on this rig, bro.  You got to pick it up.  That's who was walking away with these things.  We were laughing our asses off.  We had, like, Steve C's camera.  And we're zooming in with the telephoto lens on everyone. 
[00:31:30]  We could see nose hairs on people in the crowd.  So we're zooming in on people, and that whole pending area was just like...  I was like, oh, look at this guy.  Yo, man, where's my radio?  What's your name?  Yo, Howard Sturms.  I need the radio.  And then they're on the street, like a block away.  As you're walking away, there were tons of these guys.  You know who made a lot of money yesterday was the rental company that was renting the wheelbarrows 
[00:32:00]  so the people could bring their radios home.  Did you see some of those people?  It was so funny.  You couldn't hold it up.  Like, when you get something and you win something...  You kind of want to hold it up to everyone.  Like, look what I got!  You get one hand, and you hold it up and jump a little bit and go like,  woo, look what I got!  These guys were trying to show excitement over these radios.  And it was like they walked away with a television set.  They're trying to...  It was the most awkward line of people trying to walk away with these things. 
[00:32:30]  We were laughing our asses off.  They're like, yeah!  Yeah!  Like watching the Tough Man competition.  So, while we were doing the show yesterday,  XM was getting all the troops into the W Hotel.  Yeah.  Room 605, if you need to know.  And the outside hallway.  Right.  The elevator area.  Yeah.  The lobby.  We couldn't fit everyone in the one hotel room.  This is how motivated we are.  Do you understand what's going to happen here, people? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  We are motivated.  It was, dare I say, we were on a mission.  There you go.  Turn it up a little bit, bro.  So then the show ends, and then the walkie-talkies,  or the talkbacks, or whatever,  they turn those things on, and they're like,  all right, O.P. Anthony, Norton, you're clear to go.  Let's get out of the building.  Okay, deploy, people, deploy.  Deploy.  Take up positions by the elevator.  Don't move until you hear my signal. 
[00:33:30]  Stay by the elevator area.  Roger that.  Team 6-team, team help up by the elevator.  Delta team, we are moving into position by the corner of the building.  That's what it was like.  The radios were just screaming with our orders and people receiving their orders.  Because we like to have fun, too.  We wanted to make sure the coast was clear in the lobby of the building we broadcast from.  They're like, it's all clear.  And then we go running right into the car.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  Running in.  And we're so stupid.  It was like, blue team, blue team, are you in position?  Listen, yes, red team, I am in position.  Dude, you're right next to me.  We really don't need to use the walkie-talkie right now.  Not yet.  Yeah, I know, but it's so cool.  We actually have them.  So we should use them, okay?  Could you maybe go into the bathroom area?  I'll stay in the bedroom here, so at least it feels like I'm not talking right to your face.  Roger that, red team.  Heading toward the bathroom.  And that was our whole day of just being like, being an asshole. 
[00:34:30]  So we jumped into the tinted window car and started making our way down to Union Square.  But of course we have to have fun on the way down, because it's not all about the event itself.  It's all about Ant and I and Norton just having a little fun with Club Soda Kenny.  How could you not have fun when Club Soda Kenny is along for the ride in the front seat?  Right.  He will just roll the window down and yell at people on the street.  You know, I've done that too.  When you're moving and when the light isn't red and when you know you can get away. 
[00:35:00]  He rolls it down at intersections when the light's red and just goes,  Fuck, you're hot!  To these chicks.  And then the car stops right there.  And he just looks, nodding his head.  Nice.  He's just staring at them as they're trying to cross the street.  Like, excuse me, miss, you dropped something.  Oh, that was the drive-by drop something game.  That was hilarious.  I didn't think that would work.  He drives by and yells, you dropped something!  And then the whole sidewalk turns around like it was choreographed. 
[00:35:30]  At one time their head spins and they look down.  They're looking down for whatever they dropped.  And you laugh.  And you laugh.  And you laugh.  And you laugh.  So then, oh, then Kenny decided to do a little disco dance in the middle of the street a few times.  That car driver had no clue what collection of lunatics were in there with him.  Yeah.  Kenny's like, could you turn up the music?  The disco music.  Put on some disco music. 
[00:36:00]  And the guy found one of the stations, a dance station.  And Kenny gets out of the car and actually does a disco dance around the car.  Right.  And shook.  I like the part where he bends over and shakes his ass and rubs it to the cab driver that was behind the car.  Guy didn't know what was going on.  But that's Kenny.  Very entertaining to be with.  And he hops back in and we're back on our way.  This was the music that was playing in my head as we're walking down the sidewalk toward the W Hotel. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, with our feet all moving and the same.  We're here to take care of business.  I was swinging a paint can and I didn't even know why.  We weren't going to paint anything.  So then we parked the sedan about a block from the W Hotel.  Yeah.  And we wait for further instruction from the walking, talking people.  Oh, yes.  Okay.  O&A are coming up.  They're coming up the elevator.  O&A coming up the elevator.  Be prepared, people.  Be prepared.  Not even that, Anthony. 
[00:37:00]  They had to make sure the coast was clear just so we could get into the W Hotel.  Echo team.  Echo team.  Clear the hallway.  Clear the hallway.  Use the flashbang grenades.  Clear the hallway.  Yeah.  Everybody was very, very professional.  We had cigarette man.  We had cigarette man just watching over the W Hotel, making sure the coast was clear.  Well, we knew when he took the cigarette out, stomped it out with his foot, and then turned  the page of the newspaper that it was time to go through the revolving door. 
[00:37:30]  So we ran into the W Hotel, through the lobby.  I guess there was somebody from the little doggy company taking shots of everybody through  their cell phone.  That's what I'm hearing.  Oh, yeah.  A little paranoid, are you guys?  And then we went up to the sixth floor.  Maybe you could get a job as a photographer when you get fired.  We went up to the sixth floor of the W Hotel, overlooking Union Square.  The book depository building.  That's what I'm telling you, man.  Now I get the whole JFK thing, how easy it really was.  You were right there.  It was so easy.  Right in it. 
[00:38:00]  So then we go into the hotel room, and there's literally 50 people in the one room.  Just in the room.  You could barely move.  Everyone's getting their Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio t-shirts on.  The huge placards are being handed out.  Final instructions are being given to the crew.  We've got Club Soda Kenny there.  We've got NYPD cops there.  They were all part of it.  We've got the big brass from XM Satellite Radio.  We have a van that's in the area ready to just cause havoc. 
[00:38:30]  Ah, yes, the van.  Jaime rocks.  Absolutely rocks.  Didn't he almost get arrested?  Yeah.  It was very close.  I saw a cop with a lot of gold stuff on his shoulders and on his chest banging on the  side of the van, and they made him pull over.  I'll be honest.  I don't know what happened.  I'll be honest.  We're not in it again until somebody gets arrested.  Well, that's true.  A lot of people quite fearful that someone was going to get busted.  And as a matter of fact, I saw an email of a lawyer. 
[00:39:00]  XM even sent everybody emails with a lawyer's phone number on it just in case anything happened.  They were prepared.  Oh, we were motivated.  Yeah, ready to take the hit.  So then we took a peek out the window and went, oh, this is perfect, perfect vantage point.  But the bathroom was even better vantage point.  And if you stood in the bathtub like I did with little Jimmy Norton and someone else.  Who was that?  He does graphics for an infinity station.  Oh.  You can't, Rob.  We probably shouldn't say.  I probably shouldn't. 
[00:39:30]  But, yeah, we were standing in the bathtub looking out the window there and had a great view.  There was a corner window with a good view there.  Right.  And there was a great view of the television set, which we put one of the porno channels on in the hotel.  They're going to get that bill and have to expense that.  Yeah.  Who, actually, whose name was the room under?  Because I think it was Stephanie.  Oh, who did a great job.  Stephanie did a great job.  I mean, Megan, the list goes on, Jaime, Master Poe.  Master Poe was a lunatic on the radio. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  He was a lunatic on the radio.  I have, you know something, maybe I was out of the mix a little bit watching the porno.  I had no idea what he was talking about on the walkie-talkie.  I know.  Was he trying to coordinate the van driving around or was Air Force One landing in the square?  I don't know.  But highly motivated.  You know, those stupid camera people in the Rapport, they would have got a great shot of us just sitting on the ledge laughing our asses off. 
[00:40:30]  But, you know, then we have this job to do, but then we took time out to watch porno.  Yeah, we had to take a little porno break, and it was a great film.  Barely legal.  Volume 28, I think.  A girl comes out by a pool, you know.  Yes, Belladonna.  Belladonna.  And she's rubbing some lotion on herself, and then she just starts taking her bikini off.  She was doing what?  Rubbing lotion on herself.  Rubs lotion on its skin.  It does it whenever it's told.  I was singing that all morning long in the shower, by the way. 
[00:41:00]  I'd kill you, but there's someone at the door.  She's rubbing lotion on herself, and then she lays down on her little lounge by the pool.  It seems nice enough.  And then, wouldn't you know it, a pool guy that's coming to vacuum the pool comes in the scene.  And within minutes, he's just got his huge, uncut hog right in her face, and she gobbles it up.  Great plot.  I like the story.  Pool has to be cleaned.  Great cinematography. 
[00:41:30]  The colors.  Direction.  So we took a little porno break for about 20 minutes.  You guys, don't put anyone on hold that doesn't want to talk about what we're talking about right now.  God.  Why would you put other calls in right now?  The phones are going crazy.  People are trying to get in.  A little reprimand over there in the classroom.  Well, you've got to wake up.  That's stupid.  That's stupid stuff.  So then, I guess we had to turn off the porno, because then we were worried about sexual harassment lawsuits.  Yeah.  Yeah, I had to stand by where people walked into the room and tell the girls, no, please don't come in here. 
[00:42:00]  And quite honestly, it was time to get down to business.  We had people all over Union Square with walkie-talkies, running audio, cops, cops helping the XM satellite radio van, helping it get through.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, it was...  So we waited for the big moment.  It was time to deploy the troops, man.  It was time to deploy the troops when the whole shindig got started over there. 
[00:42:30]  And then you just heard the walkie-talkies just went crazy.  Red team, go!  Blue team, go!  Alpha team, go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Deploy!  Deploy!  Deploy!  Where are you?  Deploy!  Deploy!  Deploy!  Deploy!  All right, we're down.  We're down.  Howdy, howdy, where are you?  Howdy, howdy, howdy.  We're heading out the door right now.  We're crossing the street.  And then we looked down the window, and there they are.  There they are.  We're listening on the walkie-talkie.  We're watching them crossing the street.  We're feeling like complete assholes.  And there was Howie, like Niedermeyer, up there, screaming, 
[00:43:00]  A pledge pin!  At one point, he didn't even know what he was giving away.  Yeah.  I mean, this guy has no freaking clue yet.  I'm going to change the face of radio.  I'm giving out the new road, I mean, road, radio.  Didn't he say roadie?  Yeah, he has no idea.  Listen to this real fast.  Oops. 
[00:43:30]  See, because he really wanted to go to XM Satellite Radio.  Everyone knows that.  Ouch.  Oops.  I told you, he has XM Satellite Radio.  He's listening to us right now, I guarantee it.  Get your roadie, you're all.  So then, Anthony and I, being the puppet masters, we gave the signal.  Yes.  And there was time to move in!  And all of a sudden, I mean...  Tora, Tora, Tora!  All hell broke loose from the lobby of the hotel.  From above, all you see is a sea of XM Satellite Radio people in the black and yellow shirts, 
[00:44:00]  the big, huge placards.  Signs.  People behind them with the WOW stickers and the shirts, just taking over the whole, not  the whole event, we can't exaggerate here, but definitely making a scene.  And they split up into various groups and were infiltrating different areas, which was  good, spread it out.  We had a little problem with some of the officers until some of the people we know walked up  and talked to them, but apparently you can't have signs on sticks. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  They don't like that.  Right.  So some of the cops started taking away the signs, and some of our people got right in  the cops' faces.  Megan.  Megan.  Megan's an animal.  Megan is an animal.  She works for XM Satellite Radio.  She's an absolute animal.  She was on pretty much a suicide mission.  Yeah.  She was grabbing the signs back from the officers, because she was smart enough to know that you  could still hold the signs up.  Yeah.  Some of the other people were giving up, like, oh, I guess that's that. 
[00:45:00]  I surrender.  Take my sign there.  Yeah, Frenchy.  Frenchy was out there just surrendering.  He was in the fetal position.  Earl.  Well, you got to give it to Earl.  He had to give up his sign.  He was afraid they were going to stick it up his ass back in the precinct.  Take him back.  A plunger, a stick, whatever.  We recruited Earl also.  Yeah, Earl showed up.  God, we were desperate for people.  I know.  Earl was actually there.  Frenchy was there.  It was great.  We called in a lot of favors yesterday. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Earl, what's going on?  Hello, buddy.  How are you?  There he is.  All right.  I actually owe you guys an apology.  Why?  Water doodly.  Why, Earl?  Because we should have dragged him behind a truck.  What are you doing?  No, because I had no idea of the depth of organization that was involved.  Oh.  And, like you said, it was like a commando squad.  Yeah, this is just a start.  We weren't really sure if we were going to call in a full all-out strike.  Because we have a whole army. 
[00:46:00]  All we had to do was send out one lousy message, and we would have had a hell of a lot more people there.  We just weren't sure.  We like the insurgent tactic.  Yeah, we were definitely doing the insurgent thing.  Fire a few RPGs and then run.  Quite frankly, I don't know what our listeners would do.  It could have been an all-out, like, rumble.  Yeah, that's what we had.  It could have been an old-fashioned rumble.  Yeah.  Like a scene out of Streets of New York.  And quite frankly, you know, their radios are so big, I think we would have lost that battle. 
[00:46:30]  We're taking back the five points.  You know, it could have been a little much.  Yeah, they had weapons, those radios.  Those radios remind me of, you ever see people hold up a lotto check?  A giant check?  Yeah, was that the actual radio, or did they give them giant radios as a representation of the radio?  What's heavier and bigger, a cinder block or one of those little doggy radios?  I was afraid some of our listeners might have gotten the radio rolled on them, like the big rock in Indiana Jones.  You know, we had a runaway big radio trailing after you. 
[00:47:00]  See, the XM satellite radios, they're very cool, sleek, and small, but they don't make good weapons, unfortunately.  So I think we would have lost that battle.  Yeah, Sirius' radio definitely makes a better weapon.  Better weapon.  You could definitely hurt someone more with their radios.  You've got to give them that.  Yeah.  If the kids were thinking out there on Long Island, they should have thrown one of those radios out the window.  They would have taken out the whole family.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, no. 
[00:47:30]  I mean, do you people understand?  We're talking big.  Yeah.  Did we paint a picture for you?  Let's be like that wacky comedian.  We're talking big.  All right.  Well, Errol, I don't know if you helped us, but thanks.  No, I mean, I took some pictures.  Oh, you took, you were the photographer.  You were the official photographer.  Opie, you know, people thought those were two tractor trailers that were there.  Yeah.  For serious.  No, it was actual radio.  That they just painted tires on. 
[00:48:00]  Those were the home units?  See, big.  We're talking big.  And clunky.  All right.  I keep the cop once in.  We have a few more things to talk about here about this thing.  But it was just unbelievable.  Then I'm hearing Club Soda Kenny was just an animal.  No one was going to mess with him.  He was partying the crowd like the Red Sea.  Oh, sure.  So our people could get even closer to the stage.  Couldn't tell our guys where not to go.  And I know for a fact it drove Howie nuts.  Oh, because the signs were right in his face.  And they were so like, it was that yellow and black with the logo. 
[00:48:30]  It stood out from any blue-white thing that was there.  It just was this annoying, like a yellow jacket in your face.  Just this black and yellow that you're trying to swat away, but it just keeps coming back.  And you could see him waving on the one side of the Opie and Anthony side.  And then by the time he came out the other side, the headshot has already been fired.  Back and to the left.  Keith, the cop, what's going on?  Big mess.  Robin was crawling out on the trunk to try to pick up what little brains he had left on the trunk lid. 
[00:49:00]  And it was just awful.  Opie and Anthony run down six flights and steps.  Do they leave?  No.  They stop and have a Coke.  We got mobbed, actually, when we left the hotel, too.  That's when the jig was up.  Everyone knew we were there.  We got absolutely mobbed.  I'm a patsy.  Yeah.  I ran to a movie theater.  I don't know what you did.  All those homeless guys with their radios.  But they didn't look homeless.  They had fresh shaves and nice haircuts. 
[00:49:30]  Straining, trying to carry those radios away.  It felt like that, didn't it?  The whole scene?  Yeah.  It was like, this is how it was back in 1963.  Even the corner view of the show, like the one angle of the street coming up was nice,  and then the other angle had the better shot.  It was very creepy.  We had it right on the corner.  And then, yeah, and we saw the XM satellite radio van slowly make its way right in front of  Howie and the gang.  We don't take the easy shot, though.  No, we wait until it goes down Elm.  Through the trees. 
[00:50:00]  What a bunch of tools we are.  We really are.  You know, we're willing to acknowledge we're just assholes.  Geeks.  Always have been and always will be.  The fucking protesters don't even know.  No one knew.  Honestly, no one knew.  Because it was such a surprise attack.  Oh.  You know?  Absolutely.  And then, yeah, then Jaime has the huge XM satellite radio van, and he's going along  with traffic, and then when he hits like the, whatever you want to call that gathering of 
[00:50:30]  misfits and homeless people, all of a sudden he slows way down and starts cranking out our  Rage Against the Machine music that we start the show with.  And he got shut down within a few seconds by the cops.  And then Jaime, he don't care.  Like, all of a sudden he drives a little further, turns it back on, and that's when all hell  broke loose with the van.  All of a sudden the cops surrounded it.  News crews surrounded it.  Photographers surrounded it.  There's some great photos out there that all those, whatever you want to call them,  the paparazzi or the news photographers have. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, news guys.  I would love to see them someday.  I know some of those guys are fans of the show.  Whatever you got, please send it to the show.  We'll just post on our websites, okay?  It was very entertaining.  Keith the Cop, what's going on?  Hey, Keith.  Hey, what's going on, gentlemen?  Yo, Keith.  While I could not be there yesterday morning, no one should be fooled.  The cops are on our side.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we know that.  You could tell.  I'm in a training class yesterday, and the teacher's speaking, and my phone does not  stop ringing from the cops that are working there. 
[00:51:30]  They're calling me going, dude, what should we do?  And basically just running the operation from afar, taking care of things.  Those people were working for us yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  They let us have free reign.  It was amazing.  It was hilarious.  It was absolutely hilarious.  You know, I just wanted to reach out.  You know, many a phone call I got yesterday, and if things went down, we had to mail them  on our side.  Very cool, man.  All right.  Thanks, Keith.  All right, Keith.  We'll see you guys later. 
[00:52:00]  We're entrenched.  We're like woven into the fabric.  There's no way to get us out.  We know when to pop up, give you a little smack in the face, and then we're back down.  Guerrilla warfare.  We were just watching the whole plan unfold from the floor, just sitting on the ledge laughing  like little idiots.  Just idiots.  Eating the candy that was left in the room.  I couldn't wait.  That candy probably.  That pack of Twizzlers, like 20 bucks at the W. 
[00:52:30]  How much was the little thing of Pringles I had?  $12.50.  I couldn't wait for everyone to leave the room so I could shit.  I had to shit so badly, and all these hot chicks are there.  I'm like, I can't take a dump.  You didn't want to demoralize the troops with a gas attack before they had to go out into  combat.  Noah was awesome, by the way.  We know we're going to get some kind of reaction when you try to do what we do, do what we  did, excuse me, with all the people just kind of going right into the crowd. 
[00:53:00]  A lot of ballsy people, by the way.  Oh, hell yeah.  And barely a peep from his listeners.  No, because you know what?  Barely.  I mean, yeah.  Oh, and they suck for maybe five seconds, and then just dissipated.  Nothing.  Dude, dude.  I'm not going to take away from the guy.  He's got plenty of listeners.  Believe me.  But those weren't the people that were down there.  It wasn't a lot of the list.  A lot of the people were there, like we said, the homeless guys, to get free radios.  And then a lot of people, it was lunchtime, so you get a lot of people that are going 
[00:53:30]  to the square for lunch.  You know, it wasn't like, it certainly was not like 1988, 1989, even 1990 versions of when  Howard used to go out, when it was just hardcore fans that, quite frankly, would have pummeled  anybody that would have come up with some kind of competitor sign or anything, they'd  have been killed.  Right.  Those days, long gone.  Right.  There was a bunch of people checking out a big event that was going on.  That's about it. 
[00:54:00]  So you aren't going to get the, you know, the big chants that just go on and on.  And a lot of those people, like we said before, yo, man, where's my radio?  No, my brother.  You gots to get your own.  Sorry, I'm repeating you again.  I got your radio.  Man, you won't buy a radio?  No.  And then we had, you need the prescription first.  Then you can listen to how it's done. 
[00:54:30]  Why?  Are you selling this?  Do you work for the company?  And then we, um, we had ONA people throughout the crowd, just, you know, getting audio and  stuff.  I got to play this one, this one piece of audio.  A dude yelling and screaming how big his freaking radio is.  All right.  Yeah.  This is, this is funny.  Listen to this.  This is funny. 
[00:55:00]  This is just a sample.  We have a ton of audio.  We're not going to waste your time with, but a lot of people just really pissed off when 
[00:55:30]  they realized that it really wasn't for free.  It's old equipment that is really clunky and they got to pay $150 to activate the thing.  And there was another homeless guy pissed that he couldn't get it because all the other  homeless guys got, you got to prescribe to it.  Those are, yeah, I hope you're proud there, Sirius.  I hope you're proud.  I hope you're proud of. 
[00:56:00]  Oh my God.  Is that funny?  He's going to take radio to a metal.  He's going to take radio to a metal.  He's going to take radio on fucking radio. 
[00:56:30]  Okay.  Hold on.  I'm getting it.  Rain on your parade.  The street audio isn't coming in clear.  Sound isn't working when you play the clips.  No audio within the clip you just played.  We can't hear audio from you.  Oh, come on.  I'm sure the audio is funny, but we can't hear it.  What is it?  Out of phase again?  Hello?  Somebody?  Answer?  Answer, please.  Can't hear it.  Can't hear it.  Can't hear it.  Well, at least we picked up on the fact that they can't hear it early and didn't play the 
[00:57:00]  whole thing.  Oh my God.  This is really funny, too.  No, we're not going to boost it, Ben.  No, it's not boosted.  It's loud enough.  There's a problem with the audio.  It's plenty loud.  Is it done in stereo for some stupid reason that we need this done in stereo?  Do it in mono.  Have it re-recorded.  We'll play it again later.  You want this?  Do you need this version or what?  Where's Steve?  Wake his ass up.  Because this is really funny.  You know something?  There's no reason any audio should be recorded in any type of stereo. 
[00:57:30]  Shouldn't be.  Everything should be mono.  What do you need?  Stereo?  Oh, I need that surrounding.  Oh, look.  It sounds like he's talking from there.  Just record it so we can hear it.  Right.  Oh.  I'm not listening to like a Zeppelin CD or something.  Yeah.  It's stupid audio from a crowd.  Right.  Give me mono or give me nothing.  But I'm hearing it.  It's just a bit low volume.  Yeah, we're just getting the same problem we had before.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:58:00]  Some people hear it and some don't.  Yes, it's out of phase again.  It's not working on mono.  It's out of phase.  It's the same problem we had last time.  These guys, you know, I don't want to beat them up too much because they stayed up all  night because they had a really, really long day.  So then I guess the rally sort of wound down.  Yeah.  Jaime didn't get arrested.  No.  No.  Thank God.  He did a great job just circling Union Square with that XM Satellite Radio van.  A true soldier of the Opie and Anthony show.  I've never seen so many wow stickers plastered on everything. 
[00:58:30]  Absolutely everything over there.  And the people at the little doggy company definitely said, man, you guys got us really,  really, really bad.  Yeah, we know some people there.  Well, the people that don't get paid, you know, they're helping us out.  People that are going to be calling for jobs, I think.  So then we deployed the whole crew to the big, huge stretch escalade of the common man,  obviously.  That's what a common man drives around in.  A huge stretch escalade.  Big stretch. 
[00:59:00]  And our cartoon faces were literally feet away from them.  So annoying.  Not even Stephanie.  Megan jumping up and down like a lunatic, making sure that he saw, which he did.  I thought she was ready to throw herself under the tires.  Oh, yeah.  I thought she was going to jump on the hood.  You're right.  Yeah.  She is one of those people that just put her on a mission.  She will complete the mission.  Yeah, it was just a bunch of maroons.  And then as he's leaving, we're running down the sidewalk with the signs right next to 
[00:59:30]  the freaking car.  Yeah.  Our team is out there running right next to them, just with the signs pushed against the  windows.  And, you know, it was supposed to be his big day, but the AP picked it up.  And I quote, across the square on Fifth Avenue, which isn't true.  I don't know.  Fifth Avenue is not even near Union Square.  Good job with the reporter there.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, what was that?  Well, it's 17th Street.  It's 4th Avenue meets Park Avenue South. 
[01:00:00]  And then there's Broadway's there.  We started from across the street, that's for sure.  But then we ended up in the middle of the whole damn thing.  We got pictures to prove it.  Across the square on Fifth Avenue.  But then again, the news doesn't get things right ever.  The culture war took on another slant with fans of the rival satellite Radio XM staging  their own rally, hoisting placards touting the shock jock antics of its Opie and Anthony  radio team.  And let me tell you something.  When you put on a big event that you've spent a lot of time on and you're bringing Howard 
[01:00:30]  up and everything, it annoys the crap out of you when idiots like us piggyback your story.  When they got to pick up the paper, and because it's an AP story that gets released all over  the country, and our stupid names are part of your story, it bugs the hell out of you.  It drives them nuts.  There is no one alive that likes that.  It's a story about you.  When a story about you is in the paper, you don't like someone you can't stand being in the story. 
[01:01:00]  We know.  We don't like it.  It's one of those things that just irks you.  It kind of gets to you.  So to have that work, mission accomplished, if I may land on the carrier deck with my cock  showing in that little costume and have the mission accomplished banner behind us.  Here, make sure this is right, too.  Thank you.  Drop some.  So then the whole crew went to Letterman's studio, too, and did the same thing as he was 
[01:01:30]  entering and leaving there, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  Right in his face.  I got an email, which is hilarious, from BJ.  We got there just in time to see Howie come out to his Escalade.  We were no more than three feet from him, with the signs up for him to see right in his face  saying, Opie and Anthony, hey Howard, Opie and Anthony.  He went from all smiles to seeing the signs, turning into a snarling face and looking down,  not looking at us again.  CBS 2 was taking film of it as well, and I believe it made the Channel 2 news as well, 
[01:02:00]  Anthony.  We will just keep pounding.  Just keep pounding.  You know why?  I don't know how much it'll actually do, physically, but it just bugs him.  That's a nice little Morse code coming through our headphones.  That's good.  What the hell is that?  The mother ship is landing today at noon.  Everyone, get on this board.  It might be my PDA, actually.  Is it coming from that bag over there? 
[01:02:30]  It is, right?  Son of a bitch.  Give that to me.  Oh my God.  It's a bop!  The bag is beeping.  Yeah, but it just bugs the crap out of him.  It takes whatever happy moment he has when he goes, you know, you're doing Letterman,  it's got to be a happy moment, right?  Whatever little happy moment.  We just want to be there to turn the screw of misery right into your gut because that's 
[01:03:00]  what you did when we were over at Infinity.  Because you were a complete and utter asshole.  A hypocrite jack-off that just couldn't leave things alone, couldn't let another show have  its fun if they worked for the same company you did, could you?  You had to run to your daddy Mel.  Daddy!  They're talking about me!  So we'll be there every time.  Every time you think you're having a happy, fun little moment with your career. 
[01:03:30]  We'll be there to knock you back to reality.  Oh, this is just the beginning.  Oh yeah, please.  This is just a hi, how you doing?  We're just getting back in shape, boys and girls.  Back in shape.  Greetings.  Thank you for including me in the O&A Union Square event.  I think that you accomplished what needed to be done.  You definitely made a statement and got your point across.  Stephanie and Megan should be commended for a job well done.  Should be committed. 
[01:04:00]  Particularly Megan, who seemed to be on a suicide mission, the way she argued and stood up to  the police and got right in the middle of the crowd waving a sign and yelling.  What voice are you doing?  A bad club, Soda Kenny.  Oh.  I look forward to future engagements.  It makes me proud to be a part of such a professional organization.  We have to keep spreading the O&A virus.  Thanks again.  Take care.  Regards.  Club Soda Kenny.  Ah.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you.  Kenny likes acknowledging people's professionalism. 
[01:04:30]  Not only that, then Howie's on Letterman, and we're just a thorn in his side.  We're not going away.  Yeah.  And this little exchange happened last night on Letterman.  What about, remember the guys that were working at a station, and they had people call up  from St. Patrick's, and they were having sex at St. Patrick's, and everybody was run  off the radio.  Now, would you support that?  How do you feel about that?  No, I wouldn't.  I would not support going into St. Patrick's and having sex in St. Patrick's.  That's not honoring people who are religious.  I've never been about that. 
[01:05:00]  I'm for outrageous radio.  I'll say whatever's on my mind.  I won't invade somebody's church and do something.  That's not my thing.  Just that he has to acknowledge that on his appearance on Letterman is, people, you cannot  understand how annoying that is.  You cannot understand how annoying it is.  It's his moment.  He's on Letterman.  He wants to talk about his new gig, and there it is, the thorn of asshole in his side. 
[01:05:30]  That he's even got to acknowledge it.  Yeah, and you're too big for that.  Whatever.  Whatever, dude.  Whatever.  And yeah, that's exactly what we did.  Yep.  We're getting all sorts of pictures coming in with wow stickers all over the little  doggy company's vehicles and freaking billboards.  Very nice.  We've got to get all this up on opieandethity.com.  I think we have video. 
[01:06:00]  I haven't seen it yet.  From our perch?  Oh, from our vantage point?  We have video?  Nice.  So, I think...  Well, we've got to play that one bit of audio from the guy yelling and screaming about it.  Do we have it back?  I'm still waiting for it.  Is it redone?  That's why I'm stalling.  I hope they're not doing the whole CD over.  No.  We just want that clip.  Oh, God.  Make sure they just do that clip.  We just need track 12, bro.  We just need track 12. 
[01:06:30]  We just need track 12 off that CD, not the whole fucking thing.  What?  Oh, my God, Ben.  Ben.  That was the best look.  You know you're the producer of the show, right?  I'm talking about track 12.  What?  You know the...  Oh, my God.  You know the CD that was out of phase?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, they're working on it.  No, we just need track 12.  I know.  That should have been done by now.  Steve's doing it.  Yeah, make sure they don't...  No, we don't need the whole CD.  Just track 12.  Oh, he's doing that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, dude, well...  Up in the Sierra Mountains drinking a champagne cocktail. 
[01:07:00]  Well, you're just casually saying he's doing it.  We're sitting here trying to stall.  You want us to pull more funny material out of our ass?  Sure.  Help us out.  Anthony from Jersey, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I was wondering what was going on down there.  I was in the area, and I saw Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci covered in gold paint doing  cocaine off a bacon's ass.  You want to have a good weekend punching out, guys?  All right.  Oh, you fucking guys.  What the fuck?  Too bad the phone was a little crappy, but that was a great JFK call.  It certainly was.  Oh, wow. 
[01:07:30]  Patty from the street.  Is this stalker Patty?  Yes, it is.  Hello.  Hello.  I was watching the Dave Letterman show yesterday, and he looked a little too nervous than he usually  would be.  He's usually very confident, and he looked like he was shaking or shuddering more than usual.  Howard on the show last night.  People were saying that, too, at the appearance.  They said when he came out and made his announcement.  He doesn't know how to work a crowd anymore.  He was, like, stammering and shaking.  He doesn't know how to work a crowd anymore, and he knows we were going to do something 
[01:08:00]  yesterday, and that probably freaked him out.  We let him off kind of easy, quite frankly.  It's just to let you know we're there.  That's right.  That's pretty much it.  That's right.  Hi.  How you doing?  You did affect him, that's for sure.  Yeah.  Well, he had to talk about us again, again, on his Letterman appearance.  We're piggybacking every little story about him.  Everything.  Everything.  We'll be there.  Hey, Dennis, what's going on?  Hey, I'm on my way to work this morning, and I saw, I was listening to you, and I decided 
[01:08:30]  that I'd flip on Howard quickly to see what his spin is on it, and he has all his cronies  calling, telling him what a great time it was, and one person got in and said, hey,  what about the real distraction from O&A?  He said, ah, that was just minor.  Clearly, the XM fans outnumbered any other fans that were there, and it's just going to  be an embarrassment when it's 16 million people dwarf XM.  Couldn't believe it.  Yeah, okay.  Couldn't believe it.  We'll see.  We'll see.  We rained on his parade as simple as that. 
[01:09:00]  By the way, we're just stalling because we want to play this one last bit of audio.  We always have those little technical glitches, don't we?  How could they still be working on it?  It's one two-minute clip.  We'll straighten them out.  We'll straighten them out?  Oh, yeah.  Steve will.  But it's a new day.  I like how Howard was commenting like he was running for office, and how David Letterman  asked him a question like he was a politician.  Do you support that?  I do not support sex in a church. 
[01:09:30]  That he had to even answer that question.  It thrills me to no end.  You know, I think today we declare an all-out assault on the media, Anthony.  Assault on the media?  I think it's time.  I know we've got my fives to give away and other things coming down the pipe from XM Satellite  Radio.  It's kind of good.  It kind of, yesterday was kind of like the first strike.  It kind of made us feel like this is something we can pull off, and yeah, the assault on  the media is something we should start doing.  Yesterday, we woke the fuck up, is what happened. 
[01:10:00]  We finally woke up.  I think XM Satellite Radio down there in Washington, they woke up, and I think it's time to take  it to the next level, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  I declare an all-out assault on the media.  That means WOW signs, that means Opie and Anthony signs, that means XM Satellite Radio  signs.  There's news crews in your neighborhood doing a story right now.  The live shot.  The live shots.  When you find out you do something like that, we will take care of you nicely.  Oh, you'll be given a prize, perhaps cold hard cash. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  That we'll have to take out of the ATM machine.  Of course.  Thank you.  That's how it is.  What?  You've got to finance it yourself.  What happened?  Steve?  It's fixed.  There you go.  So what kind of happened?  That's your track 12.  Why did it happen in the first place?  Why did it?  I don't think he's in the mood for that today.  I am so not in the mood to be fucked with today.  This guy stayed up.  Everyone stayed up all night. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, we're all sleep deprived.  Everybody's aggravated, and it's just like nobody is in the mood to recut audio and shit.  Now, what happened, though, where the audio was out of phase again?  I have a feeling it's one of the DAT mics, the DAT recorder mics, is a stereo mic, and  depending on how it's set, if you record with one of the settings, it'll be out of phase.  But there's no way you can see it looking in an editing program.  It's not one of those easy things to fix.  You won't see it.  It'll look like it's a stereo track.  It'll look like it's all perfect.  So you did something that would fix it? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, I made it mono.  So now, wouldn't every bit of audio that we ever record do better if we just do it in  mono?  Yeah, and I have been, but unfortunately, I didn't do this.  And I'm not going to throw anyone under the bus.  I didn't do this one.  Otherwise, I would have known to put that in mono.  All right.  Well, thank you, Steve.  And look at what Jimmy's doing.  He's just marking paragraphs in his book for all these people.  We can mark an X on the fucking pavement outside where his body's going to hit if he tries  to even make me read that fucking book.  A lot of uptight people today. 
[01:12:00]  There was a lot of work done in the last couple of days, and there's a lot of edgy people.  We're not reading out of your stupid book today.  I'm not reading out of your book.  Just give me a page.  I got it memorized.  We're going to bring the sex back into this show today somehow.  You've destroyed the show with your gay literature, and I'm not going to take it anymore.  It's what?  You don't feel punishment?  Should I ever be meted out?  It was funny the first 20 times we did it.  You'll notice that fewer mistakes are being made on this radio show.  I understand that.  Yeah, and fewer listeners, too, because everyone's tuning out because they're listening to gay literature. 
[01:12:30]  Why do you think things went off so well yesterday?  Everyone was afraid of being forced to read out of the book.  All right.  Good point.  You might have a point.  Logan and Straley know they're not immune.  All right.  So, Steve, you got some great video clips on opiananthony.com?  Yes, we have.  You got video from the hotel room and the perch and stuff like that?  Yeah, we had a great vantage point from that hotel room that was overlooking the entire park,  and I was running from window to window, and you just saw it literally like an infection, like a virus.  The whole crew of people just would infect them.  That's why they call it the O&A virus. 
[01:13:00]  Exactly, that's why I used it.  And it starts as a little thing.  Do you guys understand what's going on here?  That little thing, which wasn't that little.  It was about 100 people just kind of infecting the whole crowd.  Yeah.  Next time, guess what?  There's going to be more spots on your body, and they're not going to go away with medicine.  What's this?  What's this rash from?  The little doggy company.  You guys have no idea.  Yeah.  You have no idea.  We're professionals at this time.  That's right.  We're motivated.  You can see in the video even at one point the TV cameras get so distracted that they all turn around 
[01:13:30]  and they all point at the O&A signs.  Good point.  We brought a bunch of people to the rear.  We sent them,  Team Alpha, Team Delta, go to the rear.  Go to the rear now.  Go to the rear.  And there they were scurrying to the back of the crowd,  and you saw the cameras that were all pointing forward toward Howie.  All of them spun around and started taping and taking pictures of the infection  because we made it all about us. 
[01:14:00]  So check out the video clips on OpieNancy.com.  Great job, Steve.  Great job.  All right.  We got the audio, Anthony.  Let's hear the audio now along with our listeners.  We're going to have to start over, so we've got to make believe we didn't hear this,  and we'll laugh appropriately, okay?  The guy in the crowd really bitching about his 95-pound radio.  It's kind of funny.  It weighs 90 pounds.  Excuse me, sir.  I don't live in a hurricane area.  I want a portable radio.  This is not portable.  It's signed by Howard.  Make me a goddamn offer.  It's a piece of crap. 
[01:14:30]  Why don't you want to carry it?  It weighs 90 fucking pounds.  It's not fucking portable.  Where's Howard's bullshit?  This is bullshit.  This is bullshit.  Oh, yeah.  Come down $150 if you prescribe.  I want a radio.  Does his fans understand that he made them go down there, wait for hours to hand over $150?  Do they understand that?  Yeah, it wasn't a giveaway.  It was a, we need $150 from you.  I mean, you know, it's fine if you're presented that way. 
[01:15:00]  You're paying for something you're getting.  That's fine.  You shouldn't say free.  You shouldn't say we're going to give away something when, you know.  Well, we're doing our promotions.  We had special offers, things like that.  We didn't tell people we're giving away free stuff like that.  We just did it.  He's lying.  He's telling you.  No.  Hold it.  I'll get the radio first.  It weighs some time.  Get out.  What are you going to do with the radio?  What do you want for that?  It's a lie.  It's $150.  This is, this is, this is, this is, this is a piece of cardboard signed up. 
[01:15:30]  Howard Stern is, he's going to change satellite radio and that's the bottom line.  Howard Stern is going to change satellite radio.  That's right.  Absolutely.  Too bad no one's going to fucking hear it because they have to carry a 90 pound fucking radio wherever they go.  This is, this is not a portable radio.  This is your home unit.  This is your home unit.  It's not a radio.  Give me that radio.  I want a radio.  They don't make a portable radio. 
[01:16:00]  They don't make one.  It's not a radio.  It's ridiculous.  How much you want for it?  Eight fucking dollars.  I don't know if I'm going to do an offer.  Why not?  Still.  You got a phone.  It's a sign.  It's a sign.  You scribbled that on there.  Get out of here.  Get the fuck out of here, dude.  Everybody in the fucking world saw me on the fucking line up there, dude.  I'm making money off of them if you don't like them.  What?  So whatever.  I'm making money off of them if you don't like them.  I'm making money off of them because I don't want to carry this fucking piece of shit.  I waited eight fucking hours.  Eight fucking hours I waited in line. 
[01:16:30]  Why?  You said you ain't going to throw it.  Why?  When I can make money on it?  Why would I throw it?  Why would I make money?  Yeah.  Well, I lost money to be here today because I was going to get a portable radio.  Nice fucking eyes.  Thank you.  Bye.  Leave before it gets ugly for you.  A whole fucking day worth of work and I shouldn't get any money?  Leave before it gets ugly for you.  I'm telling you.  What?  Why do I got to go?  Thank you.  Why do I got to go?  You don't have to.  This is over.  Why do I got to go anywhere?  You don't. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  All right.  I hear people talking in the background.  I'm trying to hear you.  Mundo mouth.  I love that.  That's not bad.  All right.  Yo, man.  You guys, that's a lie.  Because then they tell me you're 150 buff for prescription.  Prescription.  Yes.  You must prescribe to the service.  That's what we were looking at.  Well, because it comes with glasses so you can see how big the fucking thing is.  I gots to prescribe.  All right, man. 
[01:17:30]  We should take our first break.  A lot of fun yesterday, man.  Oh, yeah.  We woke up yesterday.  Trust me.  And this is just the beginning.  Just starting.  Don't forget.  We have declared an all-out assault on the media, an all-out assault.  O&A signs, XM Satellite Radio signs.  We will take care of you handsomely, if I might add, if you do that for us.  Okay?  Can't wait to see the first one.  Oh, yeah.  The first one.  That groundbreaking one is always fun. 
[01:18:00]  That's right.  All right.  You know, I want to play a song, Anthony.  Instant feedback.  They heard it?  Jason.  Yeah, they heard it.  Okay.  The little doggy is going to need a white cone on his neck to keep from licking his O&A virus sores.  That's good.  The little doggy with that big white cone so he doesn't scratch at our sores from our virus all over him.  Oh, wow.  Very funny. 
[01:18:30]  Bravo to XM Satellite Radio today.  Bravo.  Here's a song that I want to play for Howie.  Is it a dedication?  Yeah, we're going to dedicate this to Howie.  Now we play this for you.  Thank you.  We're going to dedicate this to Howie. 
[01:19:00]  Got money.  I'll do anything for you. 
[01:19:30]  Got money.  Just tell me what you want me to.  Got money.  Now may I get the wall.  Got money.  Don't want everything.  He wants it all.  No, you can't take it.  No, you can't take it.  No, you can't take that away from me.  No, you can't take it.  No, you can't take it.  No, you can't take that away from me.  Head like a hole. 
[01:20:00]  Black as a soul.  I'd rather die than give you control.  Head like a hole.  Black as a soul.  I'd rather die than give you control.  Bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve.  Bow down before the one you serve.  You're going to get what you deserve. 
[01:20:30]  God, money's not looking for the cure.  God, money's not concerned about the sick among the pure.  God, money, let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised. 
[01:21:00]  God, money's not one to choose.  No, you can't take it.  No, you can't take it.  No, you can't take that away from me.  No, you can't take it.  No, you can't take it.  No, you can't take that away from me.  Head like a hole.  Black as a soul.  I'd rather die than give you control.  Head like a hole.

[01:23:30]  You're going to get what you deserve  Now available on Nortone Records, a heartwarming compilation.  A tribute to the mentally disadvantaged.  It's Jim Norton's duet. 
[01:24:00]  Straight from the Opie and Anthony show, it's Jim Norton.  A preschooler's keyboard and a room full of retards.  Singing some of television's greatest hits.  Mister, we could use a hanger if your mother gets pregnant again.  The Opie and Anthony show.  If you ran that one into the grand.  That'll be a promo.  Look at this round line.

Yeah, baby.  Pac-10 football is no joke. 
[01:25:30]  Pac-10 football.  The Pac-10 today.  It's Pac-10 football on XM Satellite Radio.  Today is Friday, November 19, 2004.  I'm Scott Fleischer with the Pac-10 today.  The USC Trojans received a very special visit this week from none other than youth football coach, SC fan, and entertainer, Snoop Dogg.  I mean, I'm just doing my thing.  You know, you dig?  I'm one of the coldest, one of the slickest, one of the meanest, one of the baddest mofo jokes you ever want to meet. 
[01:26:00]  Can you dig that?  Snoop dropped by the Trojans' practice facility on Tuesday and ran some thrills and gave a pep talk to the team.  Some of the highlights of the rapper's visit were receiving a 40-yard pass from quarterback Matt Leinhart and exchanging verses with cornerback Eric Wright during a pre-practice meeting.  Snoop, whose real name is Calvin Brodus, grew up rooting for the Trojans.  He told the LA Times that some of his favorite Trojan stars of the past include Marcus Allen, Charles White, Willie McGinnis, Curtis Conway, and Junior Seau. 
[01:26:30]  SC head coach Pete Carroll allowed the Snoop visit because the undefeated Trojans are in the midst of a bye week.  This marks the third bye week in SC's regular season schedule, so Carroll knows how to handle the off week.  What we do here is we're going to meet some objectives of this week in terms of the game plan, in terms of our personnel, in terms of the future of the program,  and work with our young guys as we always do and just try to get better during this week and practice real hard and compete so that we get that done. 
[01:27:00]  The Trojans' next play on November 27th against Notre Dame.  Then USC wraps up its regular season at UCLA on December 4th.  The Heisman hype is now in full gear, and the Trojans possess two possible candidates in Leinhart and Reggie Bush.  Each has already received nominations for other postseason hardware.  And that's the packed in today on XM Satellite Radio.  This is Peter Kessler with today's XM Pure Golf Radio Minute. 
[01:27:30]  Greg Norman feels sorry for people who dwell on the negative.  I'm a very happy guy right now.  I'm very happy about my life.  I'm very happy about where I'm going.  I'm very confident about myself and my being and my presence.  And that's why when people, when I read magazines all the time, they still want to go back to 96.  And they still want to talk about the negatives of my past.  I feel sorry for those people because they don't see, they don't go beyond that.  And if you look beyond that, look at it as a person as a whole, not for one or two specific reasons that they like to hang their hat on. 
[01:28:00]  If you look at it as a whole, then there's a totally different picture than what they really see.  I know that, my wife knows that, my kids know that, my friends know that.  And that's all that makes me happy.  Join me tomorrow for another XM Pure Golf Radio Minute.  To me.  That's right, boy.  Take those britches down. 
[01:28:30]  I want to feel me deep inside of you.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I think you're starting to get why it's the ONA virus.  It's spreading across America, isn't it?  It's so much like the Hiv.  A big hi to everyone that turned on their XM Satellite radios overnight.  And to the people that have been with us for 34 shows, your pals have finally woken up. 
[01:29:00]  We woke the fuck up.  Pick up.  What else is going on in the news?  Oh, oh, oh, okay.  Yeah, really fast, because we just spent an hour and a half.  No, you can keep the music going.  I love the music behind us.  We've got to get back to sexy radio.  Of course we do.  All right.  We're not leaving for the weekend until we feel like this show is back on the sexy track. 
[01:29:30]  Uh-oh.  This ass over here, and there's no winking.  You are an ass.  No, you talk about me, how I'll abuse you and then give you a wink like it's okay.  No.  You brought the gay into this show, and we're putting our foots down.  You can look at this foot however you want.  We're putting our feet down.  Put your foots down.  No more readings from Rent Boys this week.  Okay.  It's a good bit.  You can let everybody run.  You can pull it out of your back pocket every once in a while. 
[01:30:00]  Let everybody run roughshod.  Back pocket.  That would be funny to walk around with the top half of that book hanging out of your back pocket.  As a motivator to do well.  Hey, fella.  We need a girl to take one for the team as she takes one in the ass today.  Oh, that would be nice.  Let's listen in.  And we'll listen in.  Yeah.  We need something.  Something hot.  Something really.  Whoa.  What happened there?  That's okay.  Oh, they don't hear that when you do that? 
[01:30:30]  Oh, my God.  That's creepy.  I heard that.  Well, I'm finally with you guys with the whole being able to hear the booth.  Oh, is that the first time?  Yeah.  That was weird.  I thought he was talking on the air.  No.  You know what?  You got to plow right through it.  You got to plow right through it when he talks to you.  He panicked.  He's like, the music bed's going to end.  Yeah.  And I thought he was on the air.  That is weird.  All right.  Now I'm with you.  All right.  They chit-chat with me constantly.  Really?  Yeah.  No one talks to me.  Really?  No, I'd like them to.  It's because you're a creep, maybe. 
[01:31:00]  Are you like broadcast news?  They're just feeding you lines from the booth?  No, it's like information.  Hey, that's a good reference.  Thanks.  That was good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Broadcast news.  Yeah.  I prefer network.  Network was hilarious.  I saw that recently.  I love that movie.  Fine film.  Yeah.  Anyway, so we got to get the sex back into the show.  Please.  Well, we need a couple to call.  It is a little difficult getting a couple to pull off the morning sex thing.  It's probably easier later on in the show than it is like this early. 
[01:31:30]  Is that your thing beeping again?  Yeah.  What the freak is going on?  Who's calling or...  No, we're getting like tons of emails from Washington.  They're all very happy with us today.  You've got to shut that thing off.  I lost my stylus, though.  How much do those cost?  $30.  Those things...  $30 they get you for?  Yep.  Are you kidding?  What's it made of?  I just made that up.  Oh.  It's just a little like...  All you need is a...  I don't believe in it, though.  Don't you just need a...  Little Jimmy wears contact lenses?  Oh, yeah.  I had no clue.  Dude, I'm awful. 
[01:32:00]  My eyesight is atrocious.  I tried to get him the free surgery,  and he was...  No, because Philitoff was backed up.  There was a bunch of people,  and then he goes and dies,  so I don't know if I'd get that anyway.  I don't trust it in my eyes.  Completely tragic, yeah,  for the old listeners.  Good old Dr. Philitoff passed away  during our time off.  We were deeply saddened.  But he leaves the legacy of good vision,  doesn't he, Opie?  He was an unbelievable guy, too.  We became friends because of our relationship with him,  and it's just a complete tragedy, but...  A tragedy. 
[01:32:30]  All right.  Look at Jimmy putting in his contact lenses.  I don't know.  Everything you do makes me laugh.  Whenever you do something that other humans do,  I'm like, look, he's acting like a regular person.  Oh, there's something in my eye,  and I can't tell you how irritating it is.  Anyone with contacts knows what I'm talking about.  Then again, anyone with an eye knows what I'm talking about.  Why don't you just keep the contacts out today?  How bad is your vision?  Ha-ha, Magoo, you've done it again.  Is it really bad? 
[01:33:00]  I can read the Opie and Anthony sign.  The letters are like one foot high.  I know.  I hope you can read that.  I can't make out your facial features.  I can't make out yours.  Wow.  I can see you.  There's a form there.  Dude, step up and get the surgery, man.  They got that one figured out.  I know they do.  It takes seconds, too.  Angel, I'm scared.  The prep work to get the laser eye surgery?  The prep work takes maybe 30 minutes.  The actual procedure is like less than 30 seconds per eye.  It's frightening to some people. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, I don't want to lose my eyesight, Ope.  You're not going to lose your eyesight.  It's not like they're going in for a manicure or something where, oh, if they clip them a  little tight, it'll grow back.  The only advice I would give to people, that surgery has become so popular that there's  a lot of mom and pop type people doing it.  That's what happens with these popular procedures.  So you just go to a guy that's very reputable, that's been doing it for a very long time,  and you'll be totally fine.  Simple as that.  Is he reputable?  Simple as that.  Yeah.  That's what it comes down to, I'm telling you.  But you had it done, and how long ago? 
[01:34:00]  I think I'm up to about five years, and it's just the most amazing thing ever.  Is there a mirror?  I can't fucking see.  I'm sitting here in a console trying to fix my contacts.  I can't see, goddammit.  See, I did it again.  I'm sorry.  I went to the Empire State Building, and I can't see so good.  This is fucking me.  I put my contacts in, and a whore pulled them out with her vagina, and there's a hair in  it.  Let's go to Rick in New Jersey as we're distracted by Norton and his contact lens. 
[01:34:30]  Go ahead, Rick.  Morning, guys.  Morning.  Let me start off by saying, Jimmy, I'm a huge fan of yours.  Thanks, Rick.  I'm going to get my face smashed.  Now you're going in the barrel.  All right, good.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you, Opie, for growing a set.  Yeah, the gayness got a little out of hand.  What gayness?  What are you talking about?  Just pay two.  Every other thing out of Jimmy's mouth.  You're talking about a girl getting railed on the radio?  Jimmy goes, lucky girl. 
[01:35:00]  Every other word, Jimmy's been, the gaydar's been going off across the country.  What am I supposed to do?  If you're talking about a girl getting railed, though, what am I going to do?  You'll go, yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah, you bet!  You bet!  You bet!  I agree with Jimmy on that one.  You know, I don't think that's him gaying it up.  I think him bringing in that goddamn book is gaying it up pretty good.  Well, I can't believe y'all let it in the door.  I've been waiting for Steve to throw it out a window. 
[01:35:30]  Are you kidding me?  He's photocopying it at night.  Yeah.  Wow, Jim, you all right?  Yeah.  He looks like Popeye, though, now.  He's got one eyes shut.  Okay, good, good.  Did it work?  No, it won't work.  All right.  Well, I personally think y'all need to dig up, like, a penthouse or something.  Every time Jimmy takes a gay, he has to read something from that.  Penthouse Forum.  Nah, yeah, we'd suggest that.  No, you know, I got to say it.  Norton is as straight as they come.  I mean, he has this weird thing where he likes people feeling uncomfortable when he brings  up this gay crap, but the fact of the matter is the guy's, you know, he loves women. 
[01:36:00]  I do, dude.  I love women.  I'll enjoy a cock every now and again recreationally.  Who won't?  You know, maybe when the game's on.  Like Jim says, it's not gay if you don't push back.  Yeah, if you're only doing it to kill time until the game comes back on, it's masculine.  And if you're down there, as long as you don't open your eyes and show enjoyment.  Absolutely.  Just keep your eyes closed and plow through like a buddy.  That was one of my favorite bits you did.  You don't do it on stage anymore when you got arrested for the voyeur bus incident. 
[01:36:30]  I didn't know it was 15 people, by the way.  I thought it was like 10 or so.  Nah, there were a lot.  It was 15 people that were arrested for one of the things we did.  And then you ended up doing about 15, 20 minutes of material on that on stage.  Yeah.  Oh, man, you're not even paying attention.  I'm listening to everything you said.  Look at your eye.  It's bloodshot now.  There's a lash or a tear in my lens, and it's making me want to...  It brings out such anger in me when I can't fuck up all my contact and write.  All right.  Yeah, I get that, though.  When you get something in your eye, and you try to get it out, and you're convinced it's 
[01:37:00]  out, but it still just feels like something's in there.  Yeah.  And it ruins everything.  You just might as well go to sleep.  Absolutely.  Keep your eyes shut.  Go to sleep.  Must be like having an appearance and having you two show up.  Yeah.  We are the eyelash in your eye.  Oh, my God.  And some people are commenting on that.  You know what that eyelash is?  What?  That was what we did at Union Square yesterday.  Yeah.  It's just bothering you.  It's just bothering you.  That's what he just said.  I was reading feedback.  Now who's not listening?  Yeah.  I wasn't listening.  I'm sorry. 
[01:37:30]  I think the book...  Well...  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  Any other day, he'd be reading.  Oh, my God.  I wasn't listening.  Somebody wants to know...  I wasn't listening.  I'm sorry.  ...who taped the XM virus invasion?  Michael J. Fox?  Because I guess it's a little shaky.  Is that what we're getting?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, you've got to understand, it was in the heat of combat.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're getting rave reviews from our insurgents there.  It was also zoomed in.  A time.  When you zoom in the camera a lot, you get more shaky.  Magnify the shake, too.  Speaking of Michael J. Fox, it's very tragic what happened to him.  But you ever watch him interview, how he's always trying to position himself like he should 
[01:38:00]  be moving?  Yeah.  It's really uncomfortable.  It is so sad.  Slash hilarious to watch.  I don't know whether to cry or laugh uproariously.  Tragic slash hysterical.  Should I cry or laugh?  I choose the latter.  Well.  Oh, he's a mess.  So far, no luck on making the show sexier.  Oh, that's what we were talking about.  Yeah, it's kind of early.  You've got to wait, because a lot of people aren't into morning sex.  What are you saying?  No, believe me.  That's the best time.  I think morning sex is fine. 
[01:38:30]  Really?  Yeah.  It's kind of cool.  You're already a little plump.  You know?  It's like the bed's all nice and warm and cozy.  Your bed runs.  Breath stinks.  Good morning.  Dumpster gums right in your face.  It's horrible.  You're not chatting.  I know, but I still don't like it at all.  You save the kissing for the night sex.  Yeah, but you've got to breathe in their face.  The morning sex is all about just getting off.  You don't like it because you just want them gone by that time. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, that's true.  They shouldn't even be there in the morning, to be honest with you.  Bought, paid for, and gone.  Beat it.  No chit-chatting.  But morning is, you know, I think it's a good time.  But there's a lot of people split on that whole thing.  They like the nighttime or the morning.  Well, you know, can you be motivated after you blow a load, though?  Can you do anything?  It does ruin your day.  It ruins your day.  But, you know, you had sex.  That's the good part.  That is the good part.  Yeah, I suppose.  Good and bad and everything.  It's raining for a fight.  What do you have to be motivated for?  Yeah, Jake LaMotta.  Yeah, you're right. 
[01:39:30]  I'm exhausted.  How am I going to get to sleep?  Yeah, you see me pouring ice water down my boxes.  Ah!  All right, well, I'm not going to be satisfied if we don't get something going on on the show today.  All right.  I don't want to go home thinking that the show's still gay.  All weekend long, will that just bother you?  It definitely will.  You'll be thinking, why couldn't we get a couple to try out for the sexiest stage in the country?  A couple, a girl, a girl doing something crazy, whatever it takes, okay?  All right. 
[01:40:00]  No?  What?  Oh, you want to try?  I thought then you were going to go to a call.  Well, I'm waiting for them to place them on hold.  It's the girl's name.  Ooh.  Why no description of what she wants to talk about?  Everyone is really slow.  They are really, really slow.  And I don't want to, you know, they did such a great job yesterday.  You've got to let them slide.  They're all sleep-deprived.  Poor guys.  All right.  Jeannie in Jersey.  Hi, guys.  What's going on, Jeannie?  Nothing.  I just called to say, why don't you guys play the drill, though? 
[01:40:30]  We played that a lot, though.  We played.  I know we have a lot of new listeners, but we play that a lot.  We don't want to go to the old tape.  I mean, we will if we have to.  All right.  Well, it was a suggestion.  I think it's the funniest thing I've ever heard.  It is very funny, and I think it's kind of hot that a girl is asking for it.  But, yeah, we do play a lot.  You know what?  I think Jeannie's a cock tease.  No.  I'm going to the phone thinking, Jeannie, girl, hello.  I know.  Not many calling lately, and we're talking about, you know, getting the sex back into the show, 
[01:41:00]  and she has a suggestion.  She's got a request.  Yeah.  She's calling in with a request.  We don't like women calling in like real people with ideas and thoughts.  We just want, yeah, hotness.  Hotness out of you bitches.  Well, this bitch has got to get ready for work, so she would love to help but can't.  You can't play What's in My Pants?  No.  No.  Guys, listen, trust me.  I'm not a What's in My Pants kind of girl.  What do you mean?  No, I'm just not my thing.  Not your thing?  What does that mean?  I don't know what that means, miss. 
[01:41:30]  You're not sexy?  Well.  Uh-oh.  What's the problem?  No, guys, I really can't.  I just wanted to call.  I wasn't even expecting to talk to you guys.  What do you think is your one problem?  Yeah, what is it?  Talk to us.  Come on, guys.  I'm not doing this on the radio.  We're just chatting.  Is it body-wise or the thighs maybe?  What is it?  Whatever.  Hey, we like the fatties, too.  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with a fatty.  That is a place for the chubs. 
[01:42:00]  Absolutely.  The fatty gives it a bit of variety.  And most people learn that fatties try a little harder.  You grab onto the hips and you go, I can't believe how far apart my hands are.  You know?  You're thinking that.  You're not saying it.  I've never seen one that big before.  No.  You look like you're telling a big fish story.  It was this big.  Come on, guys.  As long as if you're a fatty, that's okay.  As long as you're not a flatso.  No.  That or not.  Flatso. 
[01:42:30]  Okay.  So now you're admitting you're a fatty.  Yeah.  Well, maybe.  A few extra pounds.  There's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong with being a fat.  You can't take everything we say seriously and think that just because we're really bashed  fat girls on this show a lot, that we don't think there's a place for them.  We would update the What's in My Pants choices.  It would be Earth Mama Muff, the JonBenet, or a hoagie.  There's no need to think that we're going to exclude you.  My phone.  A hoagie.  Oh, you're a man.  You're a fat.  Hello?  You guys, my phone is dying.  All right.  Oh, it's dying.  Is that your phone dying?  I think it was picking up XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:43:00]  Plus a...  She's eating it.  Can we play...  Jeannie, real fast.  I'm killing you guys.  Sorry, my phone is dying.  Can we play What's in My Fridge?  There's nothing in the fridge, man.  Hey, guess what's in my fridge?  Guys, I'm sorry.  I can't get my phone off.  I'm ruining it.  All right.  We're going to let you go.  You're the punching out, guys.  Love you.  All right, Jeannie.  All right, Jeannie.  We don't mind the fatties.  Trust me.  Yeah.  As long as you allow us to call you fatties.  That's all.  We interrupt this program.  We interrupt.  The Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day. 
[01:43:30]  Who saw this coming, Anthony?  A midget sighting.  And they all seem to be coming from Long Island.  John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you in the water out there?  I think it was that Shoreham nuclear power plant.  Kind of screwed up the DNA, and a bunch of midgets came out.  Now they're all on Long Island.  To that or after Colin Ferguson, they're all purposely growing shorter, so they're harder  targets.  Harder to hit on the train.  Wow.  Very good.  John, go ahead.  So I'm sitting at the DMV waiting on line to get my wonderful every four-year picture  taken.  And I get called up to the line. 
[01:44:00]  You know how they have the camera, the line, a little background in the background.  Usually your picture looks like crap.  So I'm standing next in line.  Next thing I hear is a voice out of nowhere go, step up to the line.  So I go up to the line.  I'm looking around.  There's no one there.  Just this big, huge camera.  So I'm thinking, all right, maybe they got new technology.  The camera moves automated and light turns on.  And apparently I wasn't on exactly on the line.  Next thing I see is this head come bopping out on the side of the camera.  Move up to the line. 
[01:44:30]  And there it is, a midget sitting right behind that camera looking at me saying to step up  to the line so he could take my picture.  The first thought in my head was you guys and the midget sightings.  I cannot wait to see my freaking photo.  I swear I probably have a big freaking grin on it because it was just so goddamn funny.  Wow, that is good.  I love the common thread of the midget sightings.  I really do.  It's the invisible person at first where you hear this voice or you see something move 
[01:45:00]  and you don't see any people around it.  And then all of a sudden that freak of nature comes popping out somewhere.  I got to tell you, man, I was starting to think the midget sighting bit is getting old.  Yeah.  But it's just still really funny every time we go to it.  I find it hysterical.  All right.  It made my day.  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Let's check in with Club Soda Kenny.  What's up, Kenny?  Hey, boys.  Did you talk about the thing yesterday?  The thing? 
[01:45:30]  We talked about it for like an hour and a half.  Well, I'm sorry.  I just woke up.  Well, listen to the replay because there was a lot of laughs in that.  All right.  But I want to tell you something.  Yeah.  The Stern was reporting there was 7,000 to 10,000 people there.  I think he's embellishing a little.  There was maybe 1,000 people.  Well, you know something?  I'm not going to be the one that says there wasn't a lot of people there.  There was a lot of people.  It sure wasn't 10 grand.  Yeah, but let me tell you something. 
[01:46:00]  XM represents.  We certainly did.  We talked about how you like part of the crowd like the Red Sea.  We talked about Megan just being an absolute lunatic, getting right in front of the Escalade  when he was leaving, which, you know, just pissed him off.  But those Wackbag people, they've got to be commended to.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  I'm sorry.  Yes.  There was a bunch of people from Wackbag.com, the Opie and Anthony message board, that just  absolutely kicked ass.  Kicked ass.  The virus was left all over Union Square yesterday. 
[01:46:30]  There's still wow stickers all over Union Square.  That's right.  That's right.  That's what I say now.  Yes, that's what you said.  Kenny, thank you so much for all your help yesterday in making us laugh on the car ride  down to Union Square.  Well, who's better than you guys?  You guys deserve to laugh once in a while.  And I just want everybody to know who wasn't in Union Square yesterday, they should have been  there.  No, we didn't really, we didn't deploy the whole army.  This was undercover stuff. 
[01:47:00]  Surgical strikes.  This was all about trying to feel it out, feel out our muscles again.  We haven't done that in a while.  I get it.  It was stealthy.  Right.  Yeah, big time.  We were in ninja mode.  Because a lot of people on the message boards are like, why didn't you give out the word?  We would have been down there.  We weren't sure what to do.  Right.  But what we did yesterday worked perfectly.  You know, speaking of ninja mode, I met Master Poe.  Yeah.  He's on the money.  He is on the money, yo.  Yo, yo, dog.  He's on the money.  All right, listen.  And thanks for having me on the radio yesterday. 
[01:47:30]  We had no choice.  You're 6'6 and a black belt.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Master Poe wants to talk to Club Soda Kenny.  Hey, Kenny, what's going on?  How do I do that?  Kudos to you, Master Poe.  All right, hold on one sec.  Master Poe's music.  Yeah.  I remember this from the Karate Kid.  Yeah, Club Soda Kenny, we're going to have to get you a theme song soon.  No.  Yeah, why not? 
[01:48:00]  No.  No?  That could be.  What are you going to say?  He's big and he's stupid.  He's big and he's stupid.  Here he is.  Club Soda Kenny.  Hey, that's not bad.  He's big and he's stupid.  We could do a little jingle.  Okay.  I think that's good enough.  Let's cut that out of the tape and we'll use that.  We'll have Steve repeat exactly what you said and he'll make a jingle out of it.  Just take what he just said.  Yeah, but we'll play that over and over.  But it's his intro music, though.  Yeah, and it'll be him singing it.  Yeah.  He's big and he's stupid. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Attell sings the Insomniac song.  Why can't you sing this?  Right.  It's like those shows like Alice.  Yeah.  She sang her own theme song.  That's right.  Right?  I got a theme song.  Oh!  And you sing it yourself.  Well, because I'm such a great singer, let's face it.  All right, Master Poe, you have anything for Club Soda Kenny?  Absolutely, Kenny.  Kenny, it was a pleasure working with you, Billy, and the entire team.  I think everyone did a fabulous job, and working with you is just amazing. 
[01:49:00]  You're a great guy, and we're a good team.  Master Poe, let me say this to you now.  The pleasure was all mine because you are a great guy.  I think we have a new Democratic ticket in four years.  There you go.  These guys are very good.  I think we give them a little hour or two on high voltage.  Oh!  Their own show.  Why not?  I already got a theme song, and so does he.  And what's your theme song, Kenny? 
[01:49:30]  Oh, here comes Club Soda Kenny because he's big and he's stupid.  Let's say hello to Club Soda Kenny because he's big and he's stupid.  I got two lines.  I'll work on it.  All right.  I think we need a third line.  All right.  By next time, I'll have a whole song.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right.  Have a good show, boys.  Everybody did a great job yesterday, and I'll see you when I see you.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye, sweetie.  Take care, Kenny.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  All right.  And Master Poe, thank you.  Thank you very much. 
[01:50:00]  You did an unbelievable job yesterday.  And there he goes.  Master Poe bowing as he leaves the studio.  Take a Knee.  Yes, Sensei.  Who sang this song?  I have no idea.  It's growing on me, damn it.  You still love it?  Yeah.  Little Danny karate-ing away at that blonde-haired kid on the mat.  So young.  I put this song on and run around my apartment, a pair of undershorts, just play with my fat  tits, practice Elvis-like karate moves in my mirror. 
[01:50:30]  Larry from Texas.  Larry, you're going to find your dog dead in the hallway, Larry.  Hey, guys.  Hey, I want to let y'all know I'm also the guy that Mike from New Hampshire from last week.  Oh.  I just had to do that, man.  That's why I had a southern accent.  Hello, Larry.  Hello.  That's why I had a southern accent.  Y'all are talking about a southern accent, because I'm actually from Texas.  But anyways, I want to talk about having sex with fat chicks, man. 
[01:51:00]  It's the best in the world.  No.  You do it.  Think about it.  Think about it.  Skinny hot chicks get sex all the damn time.  So to them, it's like no big deal.  A fat chick, she don't get it all that often.  Get her done.  She doesn't get it.  But when she does get it, boy, she gives it.  And she'll let you do whatever the hell you want to do.  I agree with you.  It doesn't matter.  They try a little harder, right?  Do they all, though?  Is that just an urban legend, though?  Yes.  I don't think they try a little harder at anything.  Right.  You know? 
[01:51:30]  Good point.  If they tried a little harder at dieting, maybe they wouldn't be fat chicks.  Check it out.  Plus, also, if you ever get tired of a board of one area on a fat chick, just get you some  flour and find another wet spot.  And there you go.  Oh, that old gag.  Oh, my God.  You actually went with that old roll it in flour and look for the wet spot gag?  Hey, yeah, because I had to do it with my ex-wife, my first wife.  She was over 350 pounds when I divorced her ass.  And I got tired of going to the damn grocery store. 
[01:52:00]  You know what I wish right now?  I wish I was in Opie's seat so I could click that mouse on that little square icon down there  and just get out of this one.  All right.  Later on, you guys rock.  All right, mister.  I'm sorry.  That's all right, Opie.  I'm sorry.  Not paying attention.  What?  Not paying attention.  This would have been a...  Huh?  I can't believe I answered him twice.  Joe Esposito, you're the best.  Is that who did it?  Yes.  Thank you, sex bear.  Wow, how did I not get Joe Esposito?  Who the hell is Joe Esposito? 
[01:52:30]  See that song from the Karate Kid?  Yeah, but did he do anything else?  What's up with the porn thing there, Anthony?  Oh, this is more Congress having their hearings, Opie.  It's very important hearings.  They're not going to mention our names this time, are they?  They might in this one.  I don't know.  No.  Congress has hearings.  It's very important.  They have to take a...  What?  Jimmy just picks up a newspaper and freaks out. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  $120 million.  No, it's getting paid.  It's a cash hemorrhage over there.  Wow.  Yeah, Congress, another hearing on important stuff.  On what?  Health care, Opie.  Could it be health care?  It could be, but it's not.  Maybe public safety, something like that.  Homeland security.  No.  Pornography.  Here it comes.  A congressional hearing on pornography. 
[01:53:30]  A bunch of people got together, and they want to study the impact of pornography on our  country, saying that pornography is corrupting children and hooking adults into an addiction  that threatens their jobs and families.  That's from a panel of anti-porn advocates, and they were addressing this congressional  hearing, and say that pornography seems pervasive. 
[01:54:00]  Children run across it while researching homework on the Internet.  Does that happen, too?  Do you think that happens?  I think it does, if you're doing your homework.  Because I notice, I put in, you know, hey, used cars, and I get, like, used cars, maybe  the first two, and then used whores' vaginas will be right under that.  Yeah, you came up with a great observation about a week or two ago that it all leads to  porn.  No matter what you do on the Internet, you could be just checking your email, next thing 
[01:54:30]  you know, you're on some hardcore porn site.  And you don't know how you got there.  I will start reading.  Listen, listen.  I love checking out porn on the Internet.  Yeah.  Who doesn't?  Who doesn't, exactly.  But it all leads to porn.  It is the most bizarre thing.  Oh, no.  Internet is more porn.  Oh, no.  I thought we burned that.  I want to hear that, Opie.  I thought we burned that.  I just got a quick...  Internet is more porn.  That's all you got?  I got a little more, but I don't even want to play that much of it.  I'd love to hear some more.  That's really good.  Internet is more porn. 
[01:55:00]  Internet is more porn.  Swamp.  Hit me up all night, hugging me.  Porn to porn.  Porn.  See, I can tolerate that.  No, I can't.  That's the only...  I just want this.  We can turn on this porn.  That will annoy people all...  Of course it will.  That sits in your head.  You can't get rid of it.  Oh, it's like sign-carrying idiots at your appearance.  Or an eyelash in your eye.  My eye feels better, though.  Update, update.  Oh, good.  Jimmy, eye update. 
[01:55:30]  Remember how, yeah, we started the show talking about how we know we're assholes?  Yeah.  This is what I want you to do for the rest of the show, Anthony.  Over and over again.  Oh.  I want people just humming this all weekend long.  Internet is more porn.  Internet is more porn.  Track me up all night.  Hugging me horn to porn.  Hugging me horn.  Why?  And you think you're immune?  No.  You're like, ah, that won't bother me.  You just watch.  You'll be in a bar with your friends later on tonight or maybe Saturday night. 
[01:56:00]  Or you'll wake up in the middle of the night and you need to take that leak.  And all of a sudden you'll be like, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.  Maybe Internet is more porn.  Maybe Internet is more porn.  Shut up.  Track me up all night.  Hugging me horn to porn.  Porn, porn, porn.  I noticed you get on the Internet.  A lot of times I'll go to a news site first and I might see a news story.  And I want to do a little more research on the story.  Say it's on, I don't know.  Roosters.  A satellite there said rooster. 
[01:56:30]  The cock.  Roosters.  Jesus.  Put in cock and, oh, look, porn.  Wow, what a surprise.  I could go to a site to research the probe that they sent to Saturn.  Right?  Yeah.  And you put in that info.  And before you know it, you just kind of, this road takes you where you got it.  You read some key words, maybe Saturn, Uranus. 
[01:57:00]  But you always end up, a half hour later, I'm just clicking, clicking, clicking on pictures of barely legal girls.  Yeah.  And then you go, wait a minute.  I wanted information on that Saturn probe.  Right.  I don't know if that happens at NASA.  You just get pulled in, you know what I mean?  You get sucked right into the whole Internet porn thing.  The Internet is for porn.  The Internet is for porn.  No.  Be up all night hugging me. 
[01:57:30]  Porn to porn.  Porn.  Porn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they're having another hearing on this.  Know what my favorite porn site is right now?  What?  And it's one of the more innocent ones out there.  Pregnant and...  No, I like more of the innocent websites as far as porn.  I mean, we're in the porn category.  I understand.  Okay?  And I like more like normal girls naked.  I'm all about normal girls naked.  Like, yeah, I hate stripper porn on the Internet. 
[01:58:00]  Hate it.  You know why?  You can pick up a magazine and see that crap.  I hate going to a website and it's a shot that's right out of Playboy or something.  The model with the big breast implants.  The airbrushing.  No.  I like...  I always liked Beaver Hunt and Hustler.  Yeah.  Remember Beaver Hunt?  It was photos that were sent in.  Sent in by a neighbor, Pete.  Yeah.  You know, they'd always credit that.  Sent in by a lover, Jack.  Yeah.  Right, right, right.  And it was just these messes sometimes. 
[01:58:30]  But occasionally you'd get that girl next door.  That was another one, too.  The girl next door was another home photo thing you sent in to...  Was it Swank?  I think it was Swank.  Maybe Swank.  That's a little too normal for me.  You don't like that?  Somewhere in between.  Swank gets a little...  I like those, though.  You know, it's like it could just be the chick next door taking out her garbage in the morning.  There it is.  Like, I want porn of normal girls, but they airbrush the pimples.  Well, you don't have to airbrush.  Just don't photograph the one with the pimply ass or anything. 
[01:59:00]  They like to photograph the pimply asses.  I don't like the airbrushed ones.  Anthony, my favorite website.  I check it out almost every day.  A little plug coming up.  Got to see the latest editions.  Got to see the top ten every day.  Yeah.  And this website uses a lot of our old photographs, by the way.  Oh, nice.  Okay.  Even though they yell and scream, don't take our material.  Uh-huh.  And I'm like, oh, please.  That shot was done at WNW.  Uh-huh.  Flash your rack dot com. 
[01:59:30]  Ah.  For all your needs.  That's all I need.  Right there.  That's it?  Flash your rack dot com.  Really?  Oh, there's, uh, the girls are, a lot of them are completely nude.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You see Bush and everything.  Oh, yeah.  Flash your rack dot com.  I, uh, I like to rate my camel toe.  You ever see that?  I've seen that one.  That one's kind of funny.  Oh, God.  That's more giggly.  No, it's not.  For you, it's not.  I've never even smirked looking at that site.  Really?  It's the hottest thing on the internet. 
[02:00:00]  So what's to take a look at Opie's site?  Oh, my God.  I have to take a leak, though.  Why don't you take a break?  It's been on for 45 minutes.  Yeah, could you, uh, take, take a look, and then you could, uh, you know, discuss it  after the break?  Wait, wait, you get some porn on the internet?  Click to rate this picture.  Yeah, then you rate them.  That's right.  Let me take a look at this one.  Oh, it's a great, it's a great gambling game, too.  Gambling?  Yeah, because you rate it, and then you see what the, the girl, how the girl rates.  Yeah.  So everyone puts their bids in.  I played it many times with my brothers, uh, our old pal there, Jay. 
[02:00:30]  Mm-hmm.  Hundreds of dollars exchanging hand as you're drinking beer and stuff, and you're like, okay.  Really?  Yeah, you pop the picture up, right?  And then you, it's, uh, you rate them from one to ten, and whoever's closest, you know,  wins that particular hand.  Five guys drinking, just looking at the same porn site in a room, that's creepy.  I didn't say five guys.  That's creepy.  Yeah.  What kind of fun game is that?  It's one of those guys.  Gambling is fun no matter what you do, dude.  Jimmy Robinson?  Mr. Creepy?  Jimmy Robinson with the cape never would have needed this porn. 
[02:01:00]  He was busy helping people.  Could it be possible that we have enough listeners that, uh, you mention a website and it's kind  of hard to get onto?  Uh, I don't know.  Why?  See, this to me is...  Stripper porn.  Stripper porn.  It's...  I'm looking at a girl.  Wait, what?  Are you looking at...  I'm looking at top 25.  Well, top 25, go to...  Just go...  Bottom 25?  Oh, no.  Bottom 25 is all guys.  Ugh.  All right, what?  Newest?  Top 25?  No, go to newest.  Newest.  Newest.  I'll go to, uh, newest. 
[02:01:30]  And then go in the, like, uh, wow, that's the newest?  No, no, no, it's loading.  It's loading.  It takes a while.  I think maybe we're to a point where we have enough listeners where they can disrupt web  traffic.  Newest is, uh, good, because then you could, like, because it tells you the, um, the latest  rating for these girls that just came in.  Uh-huh.  And then you stay in, like, the seven range and you're getting more of the natural, uh...  Oh, there's an average down there?  Yes, sir.  All those are...  So I gotta go down.  No, no, no, it's still loading.  These are the...  This is the top 25, which you're right, are gonna be a lot more, um, of the stripper  types. 
[02:02:00]  Internet is for porn.  Internet is for porn.  Bring me up all night fucking me.  Porn to porn.  See, I messed up.  The listeners are crashing the site.  Dude, go to the other one.  Go to...  No, you already said it, so that one's screwed, too.  Doesn't matter.  Oh, there we go.  You got it?  I just got it.  Wow, average 2.1.  Yeah, don't go to...  Yeah, see what the 2.1...  That could be a dude, unfortunately.  No, I'm not even gonna look, then.  I'll go to a 7.5.  Yeah, that's good.  No, her name's Holiday.  It's gotta be a stripper.  All right, go to, uh...  7.5, too. 
[02:02:30]  5, too.  That would be a good one.  Let me check her out.  Um...  Stripper porn.  It's not really.  It's kind of a girl that wants to be stripper, but it's not good.  I don't like that.  Go to Rate My Camel Toad.  You might have to go...  You might have to go down to the 6th rate.  I'm gonna check out a 4.  Yeah, go for a 4.  Let me look at a 4.  Oh, well, the picture's bad.  That's why she was rated a 4.  Let's check out Shower Slut, a 2.5.  Ooh.  Oh, God!  Ah, you son of a...  Why is that a 2.5?  That should be a zero. 
[02:03:00]  That's metric tons.  Wow, is that disgusting.  It's not a zero because it's not a dude.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  See?  All right, that's hot.  That's hot, right?  That's good.  She's a, uh...  I'm telling you.  If you know how to work the site, you see nothing but natural girls, topless and naked.  That's kind of nice.  I'll give her that.  That's all I need right there.  I'm telling you.  She was a 7.9.  You could scrap to that?  Easily.  Let's look at the 2.1.  Wow.  Just a chick's face. 
[02:03:30]  That chick's face.  With a wool hat on.  Dude, my bladder's gonna pop.  Oh!  Oh, 2.8.  Yeah, hot side oak.  Is that a tampon string?  Yum.  No, but I'm not...  I don't hang out in the 2 range, man.  Anthony's doing the 2 range.  I get disgusted.  You look at the 2s.  Not really.  No?  No, not really.  Not at all?  I go to the top 25 to see who's moving up and down the list, and then I do the lace additions,  and then sometimes we do the random if we're gonna gamble.  What's the highest one on here?  Hot Betty at an 8.2.  Oh, she's the stripper-like chick. 
[02:04:00]  She's hot, but...  She's got a 6.  All right, dude, go to the top 25.  I even know which ones are my favorites.  I'll tell you which one I'd scrap to.  Yeah.  Go to the top 25.  That's a good way to get the gay out of the show.  Hey, here's the one I jerked off to.  Click on it.  Yeah, because it's a...  I don't care what it is.  Because it's looking at naked chicks.  Doesn't matter.  It's 25.  Two men.  All right, hold on.  It's creepy.  Is it wife eat ass?  I gotta look at the names.  Wow, there's a lot of...  I haven't been on here.  I want to look at wife eat ass. 
[02:04:30]  See?  Yeah, there you go.  That's all right, right?  That's nice.  That's nice.  I'm telling you.  That's nice.  Looks like a mom who...  Anthony.  Happens to like being naked.  You know what?  I don't do much on the show anyway.  I'm leaving.  I gotta take a leak.  You gotta take a leak?  Yeah, I gotta take a leak.  All right.  Are you gonna stay on the radio?  I don't carry the way.  No, we'll...  I gotta pee, too.  We'll go to a little break.  Oh, my God, my blood.  The internet is...  We're watching porn.  What's that?  The internet is for porn.  The internet is for porn.  How can we porn do porn? 
[02:05:00]  Porn, porn, porn.  And, Anthony?  Yeah?  A little something we did on Dementor World, and we'll return.  Hi, AF.  Who's this?  Michelle.  Hi, Michelle.  You want to play Hi, Mom?  Yes, I do.  All right.  I hear you want to play Hi, Mom.  I'm in porno.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Awesome.  Now, where does your mom live?  Montana.  Well, what are you doing in Boston?  I'm a nanny.  You're a nanny.  Cool.  Maybe you could tell your mom you lost your job as a nanny, and you had to make ends meet,  so you jumped into porno.  Okay.  All right.  I got your mom's number. 
[02:05:30]  I'm giving her the call right now.  Okay.  Nutrition Center.  Hi.  Can I speak to Jean, please?  Is this Michelle?  Yes, it is.  It's important.  Okay.  Hold on, hon.  Uh-huh.  Now, play it up.  Say you lost your job.  You had no other choice.  Okay.  You were all alone.  Hello?  Mom?  Yeah?  I have a problem.  I lost my job.  Why?  Because I just wasn't doing it.  I couldn't cope with it, you know.  I thought you said it was going great.  It was, but things just fell apart. 
[02:06:00]  I'm having a really hard time, so I didn't tell you sooner because I was too scared to,  but now I got a different job, but I'm doing...  I don't know how to tell you this.  What?  I'm doing porn movies?  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  What?  It's too late.  No.  Mom?  No.  You, hold on.  Okay.  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:30]  Holy Jesus.  I think she believes you.  I'm shaking.  Michelle?  Yeah?  Where can I reach you?  I have, like, three days to get out of here, so I...  You don't do that.  What?  Don't do what you told me.  What am I going to do?  How am I going to get home?  You don't have money in the bank?  Well, yeah, but I kind of had to use some of it to get this rolling.  I had to get an agent.  No, you don't.  Where can I call you?  The same number, but, Mom...  What?  There's something else I have to tell you. 
[02:07:00]  Happy Mother's Day.  I love you.  This is just a joke.  I'm on the radio.  Oh, my God.  It's a radio program.  Oh.  I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinking about you.  Mom?  You know, I think those things are so funny when they happen to other people.  I mean, I would sit and listen to them all day long because they're so funny, but that...  You killed me.  Oh, my God.  Mom?  Wait, Mom.  We're really nice. 
[02:07:30]  I am going to kill you.  I love you.  Wait, wait, Mom.  Mom, first kill us.  It's Opie and Anthony from AF Radio in Boston.  Oh, you guys.  We put her up to it, and I got to admit, man, my heart sunk to my damn kneecap.  Oh, my God.  I felt so bad for you.  I'm breaking out in a sweat here.  I'm thinking that it's too bad.  Happy Mother's Day.  Well, thank you.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:08:00]  Let's hear it.  For California.  This guy's a champ, man.  Lucky girl.  Oh, God, I need a towel. 
[02:08:30]  I need a towel.  Come on.  They're applauding from the other booth, too.  Thumbs up.  Stop, Jim.  Jesus Christ, Jim.  Think you can do better?  Call O.B. and Anthony live at 866-WOW-1-WOW  and give it your best shot.  How big does that thing get?  Hello?  Hi, Patrick? 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Richard here with Capital.  How you doing today?  What's up, bitch?  What's that?  I said, what's up, bitch?  No, Rich, actually.  Yeah.  I want to let you know that we're focused here in Portland, Oregon,  in the energy sector with natural gas, crude oil,  unleaded gas, and heating oil.  We believe in about a week's time we will isolate a situation  where a 100%, 200% return in a two- to three-month time frame  is very realistic in these markets here.  Are you serious, bitch? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, that's right.  What, are you just such a loser there that that's the only way you can talk?  Is that right?  Yeah, bitch.  Are you just because you don't have any money?  Do you just sit there and you're back like a punk?  Is that why you do that?  Yeah, that's it.  I guess you're at home during the day,  so you must be sitting there just watching Playboy's channel or something.  Yeah, how did you know?  I'm wishing you had a girlfriend.  You're trying to sell me some crap over the phone and you're calling me a loser?  You're going to take innocent people's money, some crap.  If it was so good, you would just invest all your money yourself.  Why are you calling people?  What are you doing at home during the day?  That's why I got to wonder. 
[02:10:00]  I'm waiting for you to call.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.  You got a string of little boys walking through your apartment, don't you?  Yeah.  And your son is the first one.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah, that's right.  You're real clever, aren't you?  Yeah.  I guess I'm just wasting my time with a guy who can't get his ass off the couch in there  in the middle of the day, I guess, right?  Yeah, that's it.  All right.  Let's go back to the porno channel, okay, buddy?  All right.  Thanks, bitch.  Sophisticated people invest their money in stock portfolios. 
[02:10:30]  Rednecks invest our money in commemorative plates.  Yeah, that's the legends of NASCAR series right there.  It's probably our personal favorite, Richard Petty, hugging his mama.  I can't hardly look at him.  Of course, that's Dale Earnhardt.  He wasn't in a wreck or nothing.  That's just some ketchup on his forehead.  Just when you had time to take a breather, 
[02:11:00]  XM Satellite Radio brings you right off the bench.  Get that weak stuff out of here.  You hear that sound?  It's time to take off the warm-ups.  College basketball on XM Satellite Radio.  We have ACC, Big Ten, and Pac-10.  Round ball, baby.  It'll be a full slate on channels 180 through 188.  Huge rivalries.  ACC, North Carolina and Duke.  Yeah, Hills.  Yeah, Hills.  Yeah, Hills.  Blue Devils.

All season long, we're taking it hard to the hoop.  The effects of pressure continues.  That was a...  With college basketball on XM Satellite Radio.  It's the ACC, Big Ten, and the Pac-10.  College basketball on channels 180 through 188 on XM Satellite Radio.  No one will outscore us.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio. 
[02:12:00]  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  The Bed Girls.  Do you have an Audi belly button?  You ever eat an entire chocolate cake?  Um.  Do you read Anthony's show?  Soar.  Are you bathing?  Soar.  Jaime.  Are you bathing?  Has entered the building.  Yeah.  He was part of the team yesterday, Anthony.  Go check it out, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:12:30]  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We all came together yesterday.  Yes, we did.  We had to deal with a lot of growing pains,  but yesterday was the day where it all started clicking.  It gets much more gooder from here.  It was fun during the commercial break,  or break, or whatever you want to call it.  Are you breathing?  It was...  Ha ha ha ha.  Oh no.  What is he doing?  I don't know. 
[02:13:00]  He did something like took a bite of the banana  and just went...  Ugh.  And had to run out of the studio.  Where did Jimmy go?  The bathroom?  I think he went to the bathroom.  Jimmy ran out of here.  What...  There's a banana in that garbage bin.  What's wrong with it?  He went to puke, I think.  Oh, it's all...  Yeah.  Is it rotten?  It's all discolored.  Oh my God.  We'll get the story in a few minutes.  Is there a bug in it?  I don't know.  Anthony Keith from Jersey begging,  no more internet is for porn, please. 
[02:13:30]  What, this?  Yeah.  They really don't want to hear this anymore.  No more internet is for porn.  Shrek, keep me up all night  hooking that porn to porn, porn, porn.  Oh, we get into your head.  We were...  You don't think so?  Wait till you're humming that song sometime this weekend.  Yes, Anthony, sorry.  During the commercial break,  it was a very fun going through porno with the listeners.  They were up on FlashyRack.com also,  and then the instant feedback would say,  hey, check out this one and give the name, 
[02:14:00]  and we were here checking them out,  looking along with the listeners.  Yeah, we were kind of sharing,  and you had no idea.  Sharing porn.  One guy writes,  Kevin from Massachusetts,  oh man,  P-R-S-N-T-4-U  on the top 25 looks to be about 14 years old.  She's the one that's 8.16 rated.  Hit that.  Are you with me with this site now?  By the way,  this site is pretty good.  That's all I need.  Regular girls getting naked.  The thing is,  it's interspersed with a lot of, like, 
[02:14:30]  stripper-type,  playboy-type chicks,  but you get around them.  That one,  which one did you suggest also?  19 clean.  19 cleaned up.  Yeah.  She's 7.79.  Yeah.  That one's pretty good, too.  What's this one?  Oh, Jesus.  Swallows.  Well, you guys.  Swallows 9.  7.77.  You guys could check this out later this weekend 
[02:15:00]  when you're humming that cute little song there.  Yeah, because you know what the internet's good for.  The internet is more porn.  The internet is more porn.  Track me up all night,  hugging me horns,  you porn,  porn, porn.  I don't know what's more annoying,  that guy singing that,  or the little...  Tracky.  Anthony,  we're getting a lot of coverage today  for what we did yesterday.  A lot of coverage,  and Peachy from WackBag.com  wants to bring to our attention  what Forbes is saying about us.  Forbes?  Forbes. 
[02:15:30]  Forbes called you guys  insufferable,  but inarguably popular.  Insufferable.  Insufferable,  but inarguably popular.  Is that an endorsement  or a condemnation?  I don't know.  What is that?  We do just get under everyone's skin.  Jimmy's back.  Oh, hi, Jimmy.  What happened with your banana?  Nothing tragic,  but I was all ready for my tasty banana,  and there was like a little liquid  on the outside of it,  so I figure that, you know, 
[02:16:00]  there's sometimes water up here  and, you know,  maybe a little bit of coffee,  but I open my banana and I eat it,  and then I realize that my finger is sticky,  so there's a sticky liquid  on the outside of my banana,  so I threw whatever...  I don't know what it was,  so I threw the banana out after one bite  and went and washed my hands.  Really?  Yeah, it really skeeved me.  Wow.  So that's why I ran out like that.  I didn't want to make a stand of it.  Did the sticky come from the banana, though?  Yeah, from the outside of the banana,  so it might have been sitting  in some type of a viscous fluid.  Maybe it just came out of the peel,  because sometimes the top of the banana,  when you try to peel it  and it's hard to peel,  some type of liquid will be sticky 
[02:16:30]  and come out of the banana.  I don't know what it was,  but all those...  It might sound like I'm goofing.  It's in the garbage.  No, I threw it in there.  Anthony, you know,  you were talking about the hearings on porn.  Yeah.  Out there, the trucker,  he writes,  the hearing on porn  is called a stag party.  They're having a little stag party  down there in Washington.  And really fast,  Trey from Virginia.  Trey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Trey?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, I noticed you guys...  I listened to the show  three times yesterday, 
[02:17:00]  just so I could make sure  that when I called in today,  I wasn't fucking up.  All right.  Very good.  But,  you, Opie,  when you had people call in  about your fraternity experiences?  Uh-oh, that was part  of the gay show, though.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, but you noticed  something, though?  What?  No black people called in.  Well, I could explain that.  Black people can't afford  XM satellite radio.  That's not true.  This gentleman is of color.  That's not true.  That's why I said it. 
[02:17:30]  I could tell that you're black.  I was in a black fraternity, though.  I could tell.  But you're not purple-black, though.  You're kind of, uh...  Hmm.  You're kind of like, um...  Halle Berry black.  Hmm.  You got a little, uh...  You got a little white in you.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Damn.  You think?  Yeah.  You could tell.  How could you tell?  Just from the voice.  All right.  Just from the voice.  What black fraternity  were you in, sir?  Alpha Phi Alpha. 
[02:18:00]  And, uh, what happened...  Alpha Alpha?  Alpha Alpha.  What?  Alpha Phi Alpha.  You had to be goofed on  about Alfalfa.  No.  No?  Who's going to goof  on the fraternities?  Oh, Tay.  Who's going to goof  on the black fraternity?  Are you insane?  I don't know.  The white guys  must have called it that.  Not in front of you guys, though.  Of course.  Behind your backs.  White guys are pussies  when they get face-to-face  with black guys.  You should hear the stuff  we say behind your backs.  Oh, behind black people's backs?  It's very brave  in a room full of whitey. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  But then once black people  are there,  they're like,  hello, my African-American friend.  Glad you made us.  Are you sick of white people  making believe they understand?  Um, yeah.  Nah.  Every time I hang out  with a black person,  I try to play it over the top  that I'm not racist  and look, you're just like me  and all that.  I don't know why...  Why don't you go out  of your way to try...  You definitely go out  of your way.  ...guilty white people.  You just want to fit in  while you steal something.  Yeah.  You guys are joking  about what you guys  say behind us. 
[02:19:00]  What do we say behind you guys?  Oh, with your...  See, thank you for saying that.  What do you say  behind our backs?  Stick them up?  Because black...  Don't turn around.  Because black people  are just as racist.  But they...  White black people  are more likely  to say it publicly  and this is where  white guilt comes in.  White people are such babies  that they don't...  They don't...  They don't call black people  out on it  because, you know,  they're such guilt-ridden idiots,  white people.  Black people are more open  about it than white people are.  Yeah, Trey,  what do you say  about us behind our backs?  I can't say that.  I'd break the code. 
[02:19:30]  I'd lose my NAACP card.  Is there something...  Are you guys saying  something cool  besides that stupid honky word?  That thing just never...  Honky was gone  in 30 years ago.  I understand,  but that's the only thing  that they ever came up with  and it just doesn't work.  Peck-a-wood and crack-a.  It doesn't work  as well as you know.  I think black people  are nicer to us  behind our backs.  They won't say  really nice things  about white people  or agree with our point of view  publicly.  Oh, and they're behind your back.  Yeah.  Damn them with that job.  Yeah, they know OJ did it,  but no, they know OJ.  That type of stuff  publicly, it's like, 
[02:20:00]  oh, it's a persecution.  We're just the opposite.  Look at us learning  about each other.  I like that.  That's what America's all about.  All right.  All right, Trey.  All right, thanks, man.  Bye, Trey.  Were you going to tell us  what happened to you  or no?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, we just got our asses beat.  Oh, you did?  For your hazing?  Yeah.  A lot of...  Or for being black.  A lot of gang-related shit.  What would they do to you?  Oh, they'd just get us  all in the room  and...  Make us get a job. 
[02:20:30]  There's no truth to the rumor  that a hose was involved  to get into the fraternity,  was there?  A hose.  No, that was not...  No.  Did they make you do  any pseudo-gay stuff  like the white fraternities?  No, no, no, no.  None of that  picking up marshmallow shit.  Nope, no marshmallows.  None of that.  Just a lot of ass beating.  All right, Trey.  We really thought  you had something for the show.  Thank you.  Bye, Trey.  Bye.  We didn't do the marshmallow thing  because there's plenty of time  the rest of his life  to have something white up his ass  all the time. 
[02:21:00]  Will you ring the bell?  Are you insane?  Very inappropriate.  I think that was about Whitey, though.  It was really...  Yeah, that's true.  Being there up the black man's ass  all the time.  That's true.  Leave him alone.  Let him be.  That's what was inappropriate about it.  Don't ever turn on your own people again  like that publicly.  All right, Jaime's in the studio, Anthony.  Don't ever turn against the people again.  Don't ever speak against them.  We got to bow to Jaime today.  Or is it Jaime?  There you go.  Everyone says your name differently.  Ah, they fuck it up all the time.  And I think it's because people  just have speech impediments  that work for this company.  I know.  Years ago, Jesse Jackson said it. 
[02:21:30]  Is it Jaime or Jaime?  It's Jaime.  It's Jaime.  It is.  Because some people call you Jaime.  Jaime.  You know what it is?  Jaime.  It's Jaime.  It's Jaime with the...  That's what I thought.  With the H sounding J.  Right?  I started going Jaime.  Yeah.  Jaime.  Because I didn't know how to pronounce your name,  so I just want to make it sound cool.  Because Jaime is a derogatory term  for a Jewish person.  Right.  Is it?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jaime.  Jaime Town.  Jaime Town with Jesse Jackson's clothes.  The Reverend Jesse Jackson called New York Jaime Town. 
[02:22:00]  This guy, Jaime.  Yeah.  He so gets it.  He was ready to get arrested for the show yesterday.  Yep.  Everyone else was in a panic.  Like, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Jimmy?  Yeah, look away.  What?  When we were planning in the hotel room and...  Oh, yeah.  Was I nervous about an arrest?  Yes.  I've been arrested.  So, yes.  Of course.  He's like, yeah, and then Jaime's going to drive the van around  and blast the music.  No.  Jimmy's like, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  Don't play.  No.  You play the music.  Someone's going to jail.  I was only making sure you have to be careful with stuff like this.  And we were talking to someone else.  Just make sure you have, like, certain things aren't considered a permit violation 
[02:22:30]  where they can bust your balls on nothing.  That's what I'm saying.  We knew that.  We knew that going in.  That's all.  Yeah.  And I said, Jaime, they're going to tell you to turn it down before they arrest you.  So we'll get a couple blasts out.  And Jaime certainly got a couple blasts out.  Hell yeah.  We're watching from the sixth floor.  If you missed the first part of the show, definitely listen for the first hour.  With our binoculars.  That's what's great about these replays.  We don't have to re-explain.  Just listen to the first part of the show.  And all of a sudden we see the van coming.  We're on the walkie-talkies.  Here comes Jaime.  Here comes Jaime.  And you just slowed way the F down right in front of the whole thing 
[02:23:00]  and start cranking our Rage Against the Machine music.  I was laughing so freaking hard at that point.  Everyone's turning their heads like, what is going on over here?  Yeah.  Another distraction.  And then the cops saw, what happened?  The cops came up to you?  Yeah.  We, it was weird because when we made the turn into the park,  it was only one cop and he just, you know, just let us in.  I'm like, oh shit, this is going to be very easy.  But as we were approaching, you know, our spot was to hit it where the media was.  We wanted to get their attention.  And as we got closer and closer, there were more cops and more cops around us. 
[02:23:30]  As I opened the door, one of them just jumped on the door and just started slamming it back,  trying to close it.  And I was trying to open.  I almost got into a fight with him.  Once I saw it was a cop, I let him close it.  Yeah.  But we kept hitting the music.  So we kept starting the music and just playing it.  I saw that cop bang on the side of the van.  Yeah.  He's like, stop the music.  And we're like, what?  What?  We can't hear you.  Play it again.  What?  We can't hear you.  Play it again.  Until he says, you turn that thing on again.  I'm going to arrest you.  Once he says the arrest word, we said, okay, no more music. 
[02:24:00]  There you go.  No one likes to have fun anymore.  Everyone's in a panic.  Like, what was that going to do if they heard a little Rage Against the Machine?  Well, they got to keep things in control.  Right.  In order.  It's our job to throw it out of control.  And then they had our guys there.  Then they pulled you over.  Yeah.  Which was great because now the van's sitting there and everyone gets a nice look at it.  And then also the media swarmed around it and the cops.  Yep.  But no one got arrested.  So obviously they didn't really have any good footage to use there.  But that's okay.  Yeah.  It did its job.  And Jaime is.  Well, we kept going. 
[02:24:30]  He's a true soldier, man.  I bow to him today.  This guy has balls, bro.  Of course.  Jaime.  In the van.  You got to go all out.  I mean, you're not going to pussy into this thing.  So, you know, like the day before we talked about what we were going to do and we're either  going to commit or not.  Anthony and I were rallying the troops and Jaime was there.  Yeah.  He was like, yeah, this is exactly how you do it.  We were like the generals.  Right.  High above the battlefield.  Out of harm's way.  Yeah.  We were the puppet masters.  But we made another pass. 
[02:25:00]  And the second time around, we were throwing out T-shirts, just giving it to people.  They were all around us.  It was a lot of O&A fans in that crowd yesterday.  So the second time, what they said is, we're going to arrest you for inciting a riot by giving  away T-shirts.  So it's like, okay, now we don't give away the T-shirts.  Yeah.  Let's just keep going around.  So we went around just to go around.  We thought you were coming around one time and we started cheering because we thought  it was Jaime in the van and it was just another serious satellite unit up on the street.  It was mistaken for the van. 
[02:25:30]  They're really big.  Get it?  You know what bothered me about that event more than anything was that blown up plastic  dog sitting on top of the thing?  Arf!  Ugh.  On the roof.  Why?  It would have been really easy to just pop it.  Yeah.  I was told not to shoot my BB gun.  Yeah.  Pop the dog.  Yeah, firing into a crowd.  I thought it would be cute to pop it there.  Not that it isn't fun, but, you know, could cause some problems.  All right.  Let's see.  I like when we yelled, hey, Jaime, hit the music. 
[02:26:00]  And three Hasidic looked fearful as they started singing the dreidel song.  A little mix up on the sidewalk.  Hava!  No, not you.  Not you, Jaime.  Jaime.  Oh, God.  That's what that was.  All right.  Got it.  We got to say hi to L.A.  Who do we got on the line?  Hello?  Hello.  Oh.  Hey, who are you?  This is Carmen.  Carmen.  Carmen Electra?  From Los Angeles.  Hey, we got Carmen Electra on the fucking line. 
[02:26:30]  Hi, Carmen.  She's like, hi, Carmen Electra.  You get that all the time, don't you?  Aren't you Carmen, huh?  Is that your real name?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Nice.  Are you...  You sound very sexy.  Yeah.  Are you a guy putting on a girl voice?  No.  No.  That's right.  Just making sure, because sometimes if a girl sounds overly sexy, it's usually a guy trying  real hard.  I can tell immediately.  You can.  I'm sure.  How can you tell without feeling her huge back?  Wow, Carmen, you sound hot. 
[02:27:00]  Give us some measurements here.  Let's go.  I am 36, 32, 34.  Wow.  Nice.  I do believe they must be implants?  No.  No.  No.  Natural.  Natural.  Natural.  And how old are you?  I am 20.  20.  And when's your birthday?  My birthday is September 5th.  September 5th.  So let's say September 4th, let's call it.  Okay.  How old were you?  19.  Oh. 
[02:27:30]  19.  Did she just say 19?  It always goes back to teen, Anthony.  Thank you.  Thank you, Anthony.  Oh.  Wow.  She was just a teen.  Give me stuff for your wet dreams there.  She was just a teen.  20 years old from L.A.  What are you doing in L.A.?  I'm a dancer.  A go-go dancer.  A go-go dancer.  Teen go-go dancer.  Yeah.  How long have you been a go-go dancer?  Just a couple years.  Two years?  So you started, is it safe to say, at 17?  I was doing just regular shows. 
[02:28:00]  And where do you go-go dance?  Sometimes I go-go dance in Las Vegas at Beecher's Madhouse.  Oh, you must be really hot if you're doing the Vegas scene.  Oh, you do Beecher's Madhouse?  Okay, I like Jeff.  Yeah.  Jimmy knows everybody and everything.  No, no.  I don't know her.  I've only done his show once.  You really have natural boobs?  Could you send us some pictures?  We'll make you a huge star.  Let's see.  I might be able to get me from after I get to work.  Okay.  All right.  Send them.  Well, we'll place you on hold. 
[02:28:30]  Is your name, real name Carmen?  Yeah.  Okay.  What's your stage name?  I don't really have one because my name's sexy enough.  It is.  Yeah, she's got one of those built-in names then.  And do you look like a real California-type girl?  Yeah, I would say so.  Blonde hair?  Yeah, blonde hair.  Fair skin?  No, I'm not.  But tan?  Tan.  Tanned?  Yes.  It has to be.  What color are your nipples?  They're kind of a peachy, tan color. 
[02:29:00]  Nice.  Slow fade?  He dropped his pen.  Larger or small areolas?  Pretty big.  Oh.  Cornstar nipples.  I like that.  Wow.  And what color eyes?  My eyes are hazel.  Why?  You like the eyes?  Love the eyes.  I never noticed them.  How big is your ass?  There you go.  No, she doesn't have a big ass, Jaime.  No, it's nice.  Thirty-four.  Thirty-four.  She's got the measurements working.  What's your height?  Yeah, what?  I'm 5'10".  5'10".  Wow.  What do you weigh?  She's fantastic. 
[02:29:30]  She's fantastic.  Right now I'm wearing my go-go shorts.  I mean, what do you weigh?  Go-go shorts.  What do I weigh?  Yeah.  I weigh like 130 right now.  Oh, she's the greatest.  5'10".  Oh, my God.  That's hot.  5'10 with 34.  Plus if it's in my tent.  You're a perfect California girl.  Opie, why do you write down the info she gives?  Because I'm looking at Opie.  He's like, 5'10".  Because I don't want to forget any of this stuff.  Like a Rain Man chart.  Yeah, a little Rain Man chart.  It's like the ramblings from A Beautiful Mind. 
[02:30:00]  Opie's room is just covered with little writings.  Little measurements.  Looking for code.  Can you see all the math problems I'm doing, too?  How did you know that she didn't really exist?  Her tits never got any bigger.  That's good.  Oh, wow.  Wow, you sound extremely hot.  Yeah.  We really want to maybe skip over the Guess What's in My Pants  and maybe get you doing something else.  Oh, really?  Can we negotiate here?  Well, let's try. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, okay.  We have the wrong Jaime in the studio for negotiations.  We had a different Jaime.  Guys, what would you like Carmen to do?  I would like to play Guess What's in My Pants,  but if you have something else you'd like to do.  Yeah, I like Guess What's in My Pants.  I like that, too.  Although, from her occupation and description,  you can almost guess.  I'm thinking we might be able to get something else out of her here today.  Mike?  Mike, what up?  Do you have any vibrators around?  No, I don't.  Are you home?  I am at home.  I like regular skin. 
[02:31:00]  Oh.  Are you alone?  I am.  Do you have a boyfriend?  No.  Your girlfriend?  Sometimes.  Yeah?  Are you into guys and girls?  Yeah, usually.  Yeah, that's very chic.  You wouldn't mind touching yourself now, would you?  Come on, baby.  Broby and Anthony and Jen Norton.  Oh, wait.  You're the greatest.  Yeah?  Come on, baby.  Are you in your bedroom?  No, I'm downstairs.  How long would it take you to get off? 
[02:31:30]  Let's see.  We really need to bring the sex back into the show,  so we're really counting on you today.  Yeah, I heard there were too many dudes.  How about we do this?  We play Guess What's in My Pants,  but as we're playing Guess What's in My Pants,  you're doing what comes natural,  and then we'll have the grand finale when you're ready to rock.  Well, that sounds like a plan.  Do you have a wireless phone?  Can you go to your bedroom?  I do have a wireless phone.  Maybe she should go to her bedroom. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, let's go to the bedroom.  Maybe completely disrobed.  Let me lead you into the bedroom here.  Leading her?  Do you have stairs, or is it one wrench?  I have stairs.  You have stairs.  All right.  Up the stairs we go.  Up the stairs.  I'm walking up the stairs with her.  I'd like to shag carpet.  Anthony, why are you in my dream?  Get out of here.  I'm not.  Get out of here.  No, this is my chick.  All right.  Are we in your room yet?  We are in my room. 
[02:32:30]  We're in her room.  Do you have posters in your room,  considering you were just a teen a month ago, two months ago?  Actually, I have a large photograph on my wall.  Of?  Of a girl kissing a man.  Oh, very romantic type of picture.  Very mature, I must say.  I was expecting, you know.  Any stuffed animals?  I was just going to ask that.  All girls have stuffed animals in their room.  What do you have?  I have a pink bear on my closet.  A bear?  Yeah.  A pink bear.  A little pink bear.  And your bedspread, is it juvenile or mature? 
[02:33:00]  It's just white.  It's just white.  Do you have anything in your room that brings you back to your teenage years?  Maybe a Barbie doll you forgot to throw in the closet.  What?  A lot of porn.  A lot of porn.  A lot of porn.  Internet is for porn.  Internet is for porn.  So you like scrapping one out to some porno in your room? 
[02:33:30]  Yes.  What's your favorite kind of porn?  I like Belladonna.  I love Belladonna.  You like Belladonna?  You were just saying that the other day.  We were just watching Belladonna yesterday in the hotel room.  I got a great picture at the Porn Awards last year with Belladonna.  I'm kind of kneeling and her ass is by my face.  Yeah, I saw it in the ass magazine.  Oh, really?  A little fat person.  I feel it over there.  You like that?  Oh, you know Joey?  Stop.  Yeah, I met him once.  I love Joey.  All right, let's relax with the personal questions there.  Well, that's not a personal question.  All right, are you naked?  I am bottomless. 
[02:34:00]  You're bottomless.  Why don't you just rip that shirt off, too?  Yeah, might as well.  Lose the shirt, honey.  Hey, hey, hey.  What kind of lingerie do you wear?  I was wearing go-go shorts, and that's it.  Just go-go shorts?  Yeah.  What are they made out of?  They're just like a smoky material.  Little hot pants type things that just hug every little contour.  All right.  Do they give you a camel toe?  Only when you pull them up high.  Yeah, you've got to pull those up high when you're on.  This is what's going to happen. 
[02:34:30]  We're going to play the theme song in a second here.  Okay.  But I do believe you should start playing with the button there.  Okay.  Are you relaxed on your bed?  I am.  I'm laying back.  All right.  And we really want to hear a live one today.  Don't fake it.  Okay.  If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.  We hate when girls fake it.  But just relax.  You're by yourself.  Put the phone down where we can kind of hear you.  And you start playing.  We're going to play the theme song. 
[02:35:00]  And as Anthony explains the game and we go through the process, you should be continuing  with the button there, all right?  Okay.  As much as you can, because I know you have to work the phone and do all sorts of things.  All right?  And if at any point you get really close, screw the game and just let us know you're  getting close and then we'll shut the F up, okay?  Okay.  I think we might be able to work this out here today.  Give it a try.  Jaime, you want in on Guess What's in My Pants today?  Sure.  All right.  Jaime's playing.  Let's play the theme song. 
[02:35:30]  Boom, boom, boom.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Place the receiver.  Up on your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess.  What's in my pants?  My pants.  Hey, I can hear it. 
[02:36:00]  She's listening to XM Solid Radio in L.A.  That's what's so freaking cool about this.  Hey, did you just get home from dancing, by the way?  Last night.  Oh, she's already getting into it a little bit.  I hear the voice change.  Are things going okay there?  Very well.  Very well.  Okay, Anthony, if you will, I want you to explain the game very softly.  I know.  Hurry.  What?  Use your soft voice today.  Oh, the golf voice.  Talk to me, sexy.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to play Guess What's in My Pants.  And Carmen's going to take the phone and rub it up and down on her most intimate of 
[02:36:30]  area, the honeypot.  Can you do it as Bob Ross?  That's what I'm doing.  Oh, that was your Bob Ross?  Yeah.  She's going to take that phone and rub it up and down.  Just rub it up and down on that vagina.  Yeah, that's good.  And we're going to listen in.  We're going to paint a little fluffy cloud over here.  We're going to see what kind of brush she's got down there.  That's right.  We're going to see what kind of brush.  Is it a big, wide brush that you paint the whole house with, with a lot of hairy bristles 
[02:37:00]  on it?  Is it one of those skinny brushes that you use maybe to marinate a turkey with?  Or is it one of those fine little brushes that you would do one of those paint by numbers  with?  Or is it this that I use sometimes, the spackle knife?  Look, it doesn't have any bristles at all.  Sometimes I just use that to paint in a little water line with a little mountain seam, not  one bristle on the thing.  And we'll be able to tell just by Carmen rubbing that phone up and down on that beautiful 
[02:37:30]  go-go dancer 20-year-old box.  And this is why I write things down.  5'10", 130 pounds, 36, 32, 34, blonde hair, hazel eyes.  I hope he's writing it down like a cop writing down a description.  Carmen, how's it going down there?  Very nice.  Very nice.  Very good.  This is getting the sex out of the show that Norton ruined all this week with  his gay readings. 
[02:38:00]  Don't make her laugh.  All right.  Carmen, still play with the button, but I think at this point we need you to rub the  phone up and down.  Up and down.  Yeah.  I can do it all day.  Don't do this.  Just kidding.  Okay. 
[02:38:30]  That's plenty.  Not against the driveway.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Carmen?  Yeah.  She needed a bigger object down there, obviously.  When we do this side to side, you don't have to do it that long.  That was fine, though.  Well, she can do it that long if it's helping her with the big O.  I have a reason to do it that long.  Oh.  She really couldn't stop herself, Anthony.  All right.  And how's the playing with the button going? 
[02:39:00]  Very nice.  You think you're going to have an O?  We'll see.  Okay.  All right.  If you will, side to side.  Side to side.  Oh, very telling.  Very uniform.  Okay.  And now we need it done in round circles all around the area.  Okay.  Okay.  Wow.  Now I've got to change my thing. 
[02:39:30]  I don't even need another choice.  Really?  Can I have one more side to side, please?  Yes.  I got it.  I think I got it, too.  I got it.  Let's start with Jaime.  Now, Carmen, remember, don't tell us and don't hint to us or anything what you have down  there until we ask you, no matter what our guess is.  And as we guess and go back and forth here, you just go to town on that beautiful area of 
[02:40:00]  yours.  Yeah.  You should start speeding the process up there.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Grab a porno.  And we'll listen to you moan in the background.  Do you have porno magazine?  I do, but holding the phone and holding my vagina would probably not do well.  I was wondering, you know, what kind of visual stimuli you might need.  If you want to maybe lay on the bed, put a magazine, open it up.  That's all right.  The soft voice doesn't.  All right.  All right.  You keep playing.  Jaime, it's to you.  I say it's a small brush, the landing strip. 
[02:40:30]  You're saying a little landing strip or a Hitler mustache?  No, not the mustache.  The landing strip.  Landing strip.  Okay.  Jaime says landing strip.  Norton.  Little Jimmy Norton.  I say it's the new category, the, uh, the, uh, I can't remember his name.  All right.  So let's just say the, I stink.  Oh, I still wanted to be with you on that one.  The little, all right.  The little Connor Peterson chest.  Just totally bare.  Why are you still obsessed with that trial? 
[02:41:00]  How can you not be?  That could be the most tasteless thing I've ever heard come out of you.  That is horrid.  That would be a wood floor?  Yeah.  Connor, Peterson, Jets.  Anthony?  A little crib that'll never get used.  Yeah.  A little mobile just hanging.  No one to go, smile at it.  No sticky fingers will ever make contact with it.  Never.  Sky blue paint brought back. 
[02:41:30]  All right, all right, all right.  All right, all right.  Little stars.  Jesus.  Kittens.  All right, all right, all right.  All right.  Let me think.  I think based on her occupation, based on the fact that she wears those very tight shorts  that you can pretty much see everything through, then based on the sound, I'm going to say wood  floor.  Wood floor.  I'm going with Jimmy.  Okay.  Connor chest.  Horrible.  Carmen?  Yeah.  Wait, did you guess? 
[02:42:00]  No, I just want to hear if she's like still, you're still playing?  Of course.  Are you getting anywheres?  I'm moving up.  Or anywhere?  Huh?  I'm moving up in the ranks, yeah.  All right, she's moving up in the ranks, Anthony.  I think L.A. does things differently, and I'm going to go with Jaime, and I'm going to  say a landing strip.  Landing strip, so you're saying the strip of hair.  Yes.  That's good.  All right, Carmen?  Yes.  What is in your pants?  Wood floor. 
[02:42:30]  Wood floor.  I've only missed one all since we've been back, dude.  Yes.  That's pretty amazing, actually.  You're really doing well.  Let's play the theme song, and then we'll see what Carmen's up to.  I've got to sneak that in.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  You want them to delay?  They don't.  Place the receiver upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants? 
[02:43:00]  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  All right.  There you have it.  Carmen from L.A., Anthony.  Go-go dancer.  Carmen?  Yes.  What's going on there?  I'm getting very close.  Should we just listen in now?  Let's listen.  All right.  Don't fucking ruin this, you ass. 
[02:43:30]  She can't hear us right now.  What are you doing?  Don't fart.  Don't fart. 
[02:44:00]  You ass.  It's all hot.  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  Shut up.  Oh, my God.  That stinks.  Jimmy ruined it.  Holy shit, that stinks.  Like smell-o-vision.  This is a bittersweet moment.  Oh, God.  Stop. 
[02:44:30]  She's trying to...  Oh, this is truly the best and worst of both worlds.  Why do you have to ruin everything?  Okay.  Wow.  That is for porn.  That was great. 
[02:45:00]  Carmen.  That was really good, Carmen.  You just became a star on the Opie and Anthony show.  Everyone's going to want to see your pictures, so if you feel like sending in a few, maybe  some sexy shots or naked, whatever you want to do, we'd love to throw your pictures up  on the websites, okay?  Put her on hold.  Well, you never know.  They might be able to see me in New Jersey.  I'm flying out for Robert Kelly's show at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  Oh, bravo.  You know this chick?  Robert Kelly happens to be here.  Kelly, you rock.  Look at him.  Wow. 
[02:45:30]  Excellent.  Brownie points.  Carmen.  Wonderful.  Excellent.  All right, so you're going to be at the Robert Kelly show?  Yeah.  Bob Kelly?  Yes.  Where's he playing?  He's at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  You son of a bitch.  That's a way to give a plug, Jamie.  I bow to Bob Kelly today, though.  Brilliant.  732-545-4242 is the Stress Factory number.  Ha ha, if you have to remember something.  Ha ha.  And you didn't lie about your hotness, did you?  No, I didn't.  No, that's just a feature show. 
[02:46:00]  She's hot.  They're all hot.  All right, right on.  Carmen, you rock.  I'm going to put you on hold just in case you want to send some pictures in, okay?  Okay.  Nice.  Bye.  Very nice.  That was nice.  Look at Bob going, yeah, look what I did.  He's all happy and confident.  Get your ass in here.  Look at him.  That was good, Bob.  Yeah, look.  He won't be in for 15 seconds.  Oh, that's right, yeah, because of the delay.  Well, there's a window there.  Do the wave.  Jesus.  Oh.  How you doing?  Jimmy, did you just fart again?  I thought I heard a bump.  That was hilarious during the vid.  That's what I heard.  You really are a buzzkill, though. 
[02:46:30]  You ruin everything for everybody.  We're kind of getting into it.  She's moaning.  She's, like, really getting it, and Jimmy's laughing, giggling like a retard, and we hit  the button so she can't hear it so it doesn't completely ruin it, and Jimmy's like, I farted.  It's kindergarten.  They're the worst farts ever, too.  Oh, he does it in the building where he'll be in the elevator, and he'll just crack one  out and then get off, and then the people are just sitting there like, ugh.  It's like he went into a funeral home and ate the ass of a cadaver, and then farted out 
[02:47:00]  whatever happened inside of him.  And what did he do in the elevator?  Was it yesterday or the day before where we wanted to freaking disappear?  We were talking.  He does it all the time.  Yeah, but it was something I said, and then...  What the hell was it?  I don't remember.  Whatever.  I got in the elevator the other day, and some business guy is in there, and right as  the doors are closing, Jimmy comes running towards the door.  Wait, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie.  And the door shuts, and now I'm in there with this business guy who's looking at me like 
[02:47:30]  Jimmy was yelling sweetie at me.  And I just kind of glanced, and I'm like, that guy's a kook.  Like, it doesn't take away that he was yelling sweetie, sweetie.  So, Bob...  Did you like the gift?  Oh, you rock.  Well, I wanted to give you something that you couldn't throw in my face like poker chips.  Do you know there's a line...  There's no line with me.  I know, but that's what I'm saying.  Like, other people can hold the baby and not throw it. 
[02:48:00]  I wouldn't throw the baby.  You're the type of guy that would just huck a kid.  I wouldn't throw the baby.  I would just poke at it a little bit.  You should see Opie's house at Christmas time.  He's just heaving gifts at people's faces.  There's no gifts.  He doesn't have chairs at his house.  He doesn't have gifts.  No, Santa doesn't stop at his house.  No, he doesn't.  That was the worst video I've...  I felt...  I cringed.  Oh, we haven't talked to you since the poker video?  No.  Last time I was on here, there was a wiffle ball bat and a girl's twat.  Yeah, that was great.  I was in shock for like two days.  That was a good one.  We're going to do some kind of Thanksgiving feast on this calendar next week. 
[02:48:30]  Really?  Yeah, girls eating Thanksgiving crap off each other, I guess.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Food and sex.  Never mix.  Never good.  It is disgusting.  Everyone goes, oh, you ever see that movie, nine and a half weeks, it's so hot.  No, it's not hot.  It's not about...  You've been brainwashed into thinking it's hot.  It's in actuality disgusting.  We didn't say it was going to be a hot bit.  It's going to be a silly bit.  It's disgusting.  It's silly.  They pour chocolate and they pour chocolate and it looks like shit just all over.  All right, you're right.  There are times where it's cool, but I mean, most times it's awful. 
[02:49:00]  I'm going to...  All right, baby.  I'm going to wrap a shrimp around my cock and I'm...  Did you hear me?  I just...  I was...  I just did a show in Tempe and I did all this regular terrestrial radio, as you guys  say, which I love that term.  Yeah, you almost stopped saying shit.  I almost...  I went shit, shit.  Like I...  That mic's over-modulating way too much.  You're going to have to bring it down a little bit.  What's modulating mean?  It's like over-modulating.  Yeah, try it.  Modulating.  You should be better now.  Am I modulating better?  I'm going to sound like this.  You're going to sound like this.  Tell me...  All right.  Let's get back to the poker chip video.  Who's that hot girl out there, by the way?  I don't know.  She's from my evil... 
[02:49:30]  Oh, that's Yoshi's boss.  She's from Evil Angel.  She's bringing us porn.  But she's not...  Oh, okay.  She doesn't do it.  She's not doing anything.  I already went through.  It's for porn.  Really?  She's bringing porn?  Our goal is to get everyone to hum this song over the weekend when they don't want to.  So, getting back to the poker chip video, though.  Yes.  Tell me that wasn't one of the funniest things you've ever seen after the uncomfortable moment.  I've never felt an uncomfortable moment like that, really.  Because, you know, I've seen some pretty atrocious stuff.  I mean, I've seen... 
[02:50:00]  We've made girls cry at the cellar and just leave, and we all applaud as they leave.  I mean, I've seen uncomfortable...  That really made me cringe and made me think about, like, what am I doing?  Am I a nice guy?  Am I...  You are a nice guy if you cringe.  Yeah, but the people I know, it's like, what?  I know, Opie.  Is this wrong with me for knowing this guy?  You're right.  You get those feelings sometimes.  It's like, this is...  I didn't have any problem doing it.  Sometimes I've got to look at the bigger picture of life, and this is just a bad part of it.  I didn't have any problem doing it, and it just made me laugh harder than I've ever laughed in my life. 
[02:50:30]  And then to see him turn completely red, Norton, and he couldn't look at her, and then Anthony was literally looking out the window.  I couldn't take it.  Do you understand the sound of the poker chips?  Yeah.  It just...  I mean, you know how hard it is to get that box of poker chips?  That's a pretty nice...  I've tried to get poker chips.  That's a pretty nice gift.  That is an awful gift, Bob.  Let me see.  And look how...  That is horrid.  And look, that's the famous poker chip holder.  You can go online right now and get real chips like you play with in real casinos.  Those are cheap, cheesy plastic chips. 
[02:51:00]  In some wood thing that looks like it was from the 60s.  But that's probably worth money.  Those are hard to find.  No, that's...  They're not hard to find.  The only thing would have been made that worse if you made her actually pick up all the poker chips after you did that to her and put them back in there.  Well, Anthony's screaming lines from the Godfather.  No, clean it up!  Clean it up, Guinea Brett!  She didn't know it was like lines from the Godfather, so he says it's bad.  Yeah, she thought I was really yelling at her.  Right.  Go show Carlo the trick.  The trick.  And then she ran out crying.  I was going to say the chips, and I almost said the tree like the movie.  The trick.  Oh, I stink. 
[02:51:30]  Well, the video is...  I think it's still up on opiananthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  And next week, we're going to take a couple days off.  That's definitely one of the bits we're going to replay, because a lot of new people just tuning in the show, that's one you definitely got to check out.  I have an uncomfortable bit on my website.  When me and Colin Quinn were in Japan doing the tour, we went to this Japanese garden, and it was like, you know, so peaceful, and all these little things.  You pick up rocks and put them on, and you say a prayer and tie a thing to a tree. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, I knock down those things when I'm going hiking.  So we go over this bridge, and there's a little pond, and there's one beautiful, like, 10-pound swan with turtles and, you know, fish coming up.  Spiritual Asian.  Yeah, it was just unbelievable, little Asian ladies dressed in the geisha girl, like, clicking across the bridge.  And I'm like, wow, this is amazing, clicking away with my camera.  And I look, and Colin goes on the top of the bridge, and he's looking at the swan.  He's like, wow, what a beautiful swan.  And this lunatic takes a quarter out of his pocket and hums it at the swan's chest, and all you hear is thump, and then runs like a friggin' nine-year-old and just takes off. 
[02:52:30]  What an ass.  I was, like, in shock.  I'm like, did you just throw a quarter at a friggin' swan's, and you just heard it go thump, and just bury it into the swan's chest.  Oh, he's a friggin' loser.  Could not appreciate a moment like that.  Oh, and then you get, and the USO lady, who's like a total, you know, fat chick, peace activist, who hated us day one. 
[02:53:00]  Me, Nick DiPaolo, and Colin hated our guts.  I could see that.  Caught us talking shit about her.  She's up at the window upstairs, and we're just going, that fat moose, this fatso.  She's annoying.  And then I go like this.  I just go upstairs.  Her window's wide open.  All of a sudden, you hear this fatso coming down the stairs.  He goes, hey, guys, if I've said anything to offend you, I apologize, and I really didn't mean it. 
[02:53:30]  But you know what?  You know, you don't have to talk about me behind my back.  And Nick goes, well, that apology was nice until you said that, ruined it with the end piece.  I was like, Jesus, you're such a dick.  Look how comfortable he feels because he gave us a girl.  He's holding his coffee all confident.  Because he knows he's got a bye.  Yeah, he's done.  He did his job.  There's nothing I can do to you today.  You helped the show.  You do make me nervous, Opie.  I know.  You do.  Because outside the studio, it's like, hey, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  But the last time we hung out for like the year I've known you, the last time we hung out, 
[02:54:00]  you started slamming me about my ankles and started picking me apart.  I was like, something's changed.  What happened?  Because I knew you were going to be back on the show.  Did you ever do our show?  I've never done the show.  Wow.  You knocked his ankles?  Yeah.  I just had to show him who was boss because I knew we were going back on the radio soon  and I didn't want him to get any ideas that he could do.  You know something?  What?  I got the same problem.  You do too?  And I think it's the socks.  It's the socks.  No, man.  Anthony, I love you, man.  It's the socks.  Not the socks. 
[02:54:30]  It's the socks.  It's not the socks.  Because he wears like capri pants.  Because you have baby blonde hair, Opie.  I don't wear capri pants.  No, he does.  Do you shave your thing?  No, I don't shave his.  I don't shave my ankles.  It's because we have man black Italian hair.  I got it right.  And he has baby blonde hair.  And sometimes, I don't understand, with the socks.  Norton has no hair.  You have no hair anyway.  You know what's hilarious about Norton?  The only muscle on his body is his calf.  I have bully pin calves, ladies.  Line up.  That's all he's got. 
[02:55:00]  That's the only muscle.  Ben is very hairy.  Ben, where you pull your socks up, is there hair under it?  Yeah, he has hair.  Wait, you have that same problem?  I'm a little mangy under my socks.  I am too.  Why is that?  Because of socks.  You wore socks your whole life.  It sweats.  It kills the poor.  And then the socks die off.  I mean, the hair dies off.  The cirques.  So I guess you wore a lot of hats growing up?  I got a little bit.  You friggin' douche.  I really. 
[02:55:30]  I got a little.  You have bangs, Opie.  Oh, yeah.  Friggin' hearty boy.  Listen.  Friggin'.  There's a few wispy hairs under my sock, but it looks like a chemo patient's head under  there.  Or the chicken you get in the supermarket where there's just a few remaining hairs.  The cheap chicken where there's some hair still on it.  The Chinese chicken wing.  Let's go to Gio in New York.  Gio.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Norton, you suck.  I'm trying to whack one out.  You're farting in the studio.  I'm sorry, Gio.  I didn't mean to.  It just slipped out. 
[02:56:00]  I got excited.  You know what?  Because it has to be about Norton.  That's not true.  I had to fart.  This is true.  We were all enjoying a special moment.  We were all bonding.  And you had a fart.  I couldn't help it.  You couldn't walk out of the studio at that point?  No.  Absolutely not.  What kind of self-respecting guy walks out of a studio and farts?  He does it at my house.  I'll invite him over for dinner.  Me and my girlfriend, the dogs.  And he'll cut one out at the house.  In front of my girlfriend.  Well, no guy walks out.  You can't walk out and farts.  You can't do it.  All right.  You should.  Now, what kind of guy would I be?  Glenn and PA, what's up?  Nice one.  Oh, not much.  I called up to a bitch about Norton. 
[02:56:30]  Why, Glenn?  Because you're a scumbag and you ruin everything that's fucking sexy on the show.  You turn everything gay or about you and you fucking suck.  There you go.  Now, tell me what you mean.  I'm not sure what you mean.  Every time something good's going on the show, you don't know when to shut up and let the professionals  like Opie and Anthony handle the show.  You got to just be in there and get your shit in there.  And it's all about you and you fuck it all up every time.  Now, hold on.  Now, let me have some examples.  Like right now with the farting.  Okay.  Well, I didn't actually say anything.  All right.  Starting the show two days ago with the farting. 
[02:57:00]  Okay.  And during the guest list in my pants, you started with all the questions because you  want to know about the girls like you're trying to, you know.  Talk to a girl.  I'm on the Internet later or something.  I will agree.  You got to pick up on these girls every time.  Absolutely.  So you just said I did gay stuff, but now you're accusing me of hitting on the girls too much.  You got to be consistent, Glenn.  I'm just expecting you to start ragging on my mother or something like you did with  the guy last week that called up bitching about you.  No.  Is that what you want?  Yeah.  And I don't just trip on somebody's mother without due cause. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  If you have a justifiable complaint, I will let you trash me.  And I'm actually surprised nobody played this for you.  I don't know.  What is he playing?  I don't know.  What is that?  Was he doing a line from a movie?  I don't know.  Oh.  Are you trying to play sound effects?  No.  He's gone now.  I feel more uncomfortable than the chip thing now.  What?  Isn't that awful?  All right.  Just let him bury himself.  What an awful caller. 
[02:58:00]  Awful.  Just let it sit.  Yeah, go ahead.  So what do you got to say, sweetie?  Let it sit in his unfunniness.  You guys want to hear anything at the break?  Anything we haven't played in a while?  I like that cunt song.  You didn't give the warning.  We didn't know it was coming.  Wow.  Why?  You can't say that?  Battle stations.  Battle stations.  The whole warning.  Oh, you could say it.  You could say it.  I'm sorry.  But we have to play the warning first.  We're trying to be more female friendly.  You've got to raise your hand or something to give us the sign that you want to go there,  and then we play this silly thing.  Warning.  Warning.  C-word alert.  C-word alert. 
[02:58:30]  Warning.  Warning.  Can I say it now?  We're trying to get more women listeners.  I want to hear the cunt song.  There you go.  Trying to be more female friendly, so if they hear the warning, they can shield their eyes.  I apologize, ladies out there.  I apologize.  Jimmy, you like this one here, or do you need more meat coming out of it?  Oh, my God, yeah.  I like that.  There's a clip of a fat puss going around.  It's called hamburger, or it's called cheeseburger.  But no, no.  This chick is so hot, and the lips are not.  It's not dangling.  There's a guy just pinching in between his fingers. 
[02:59:00]  They're just really fat, but they're very tight and firm.  Yeah.  I like to call it Muppet mouth.  See, that's good.  Yeah, it's definitely a Muppet mouth.  Absolutely.  That's exactly what it is.  Yeah, exactly.  It does look like Curious George's face.  I love that.  Sideways.  You really like it like that?  Fatter even, yeah.  That's not bad, as long as there's nothing hanging out of it.  I don't mind that either.  I don't like looking like the roast beef exploded on the deli slicer, you know, one of those.  He showed me a picture of what he likes.  It actually had, the clitoris had a penis head. 
[02:59:30]  Did it?  It looked like a penis head.  That was, that's the rare exception.  Like a little helmet.  That's a rare exception of the two-inch clip.  That's very rare.  He showed me one, and it was painted like Kiss.  Like the, the, the, had a Paul Stanley.  Had a little star over the clip.  Star on it.  And it beat him, and then cuddled with him.  Is sick fuck.  I would talk, but I don't want to ruin it for Glenn.  Yeah, don't ruin it for Glenn.  Real fast, I want to acknowledge Stingray from whackbag.com. 
[03:00:00]  He did a great job yesterday.  Stingray, huh?  With all that crazy shit we did, okay?  There you go.  He was the one outside Letterman with the Opie and Anthony signs, literally three feet from  Oh, Letterman.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We were all over the place yesterday, so.  Um, all right, we'll play the worst thing you could possibly play on the radio right now.  There's nothing worse than this.  Why, you'll like it like that.  Look at that one.  Wow.  God.  Oh, it looks like the mouth of a sperm whale.  Looks like, looks like she's allergic to seafood. 
[03:00:30]  Freaking swelled up vagina.  Uh, with that.  That is swollen.  With that, we'll play this, and we'll be back with, uh, Bob Kelly.  You have, like, a gambling thing you wanted to talk about or something?  We never got to you that day.  I've got a million stories.  I've got a, like, Seinfeld story.  I've got a million of them.  I've got a million stories for you.  I've got a million stories for you, Opie.  I've got a million stories for you, Opie.  I've got a million stories for you, Opie.  Opie, I've just shown a lot of confidence today after giving us that 20-year-old stripper,  and I don't blame him.  Let's listen to this.  C is for the way you crap on me. 
[03:01:00]  You is cause you're ugly, and so's your peach.  Ends for no, I never told you that I railed your sister.  Tea, thanks for the hummers.  They were better than your mother's.  Cunt is all you'll ever be. 
[03:01:30]  It's true.  Cunt, you must be more than one or two.  Pew, your gash is stanky, and your ass is always cranky.  Cunt, the word was made for you.  You see, it's for castration, try that on me.  Hey, hey, you, well, I urinated, have a shot, it's free. 
[03:02:00]  Ends for some big negro tearing up your leather cheerio.  Tea, you friggin' swat, no, you will never be forgotten.  Cunt is all you've ever been to me.  A cunt, and a really big one, and all my friends agree. 
[03:02:30]  You're that slang word for vagina, can't describe you any finer.  Cunt, the word's just right for you.  Whoa, cunt, the word was made for you.  Can I believe it up, up, up, up.  Cunt, the word was made for you.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony.

You carry them?  We don't want them.  Well, Carmelo looking to buy them, not to sell them. 
[03:04:30]  I don't want them, don't have them, and I'm not interested in them.  Carmelo looking to buy them from you.  Not from selling them from you.  You're not buying them from me because I don't have them.  Yep.  Okay, Carmelo knows how this works, and he got money.  He could grease the right wheels.  Well, honey, I wish you a lot of luck.  I'm not interested in this call.  You have a nice day.  Goodbye.  Okay, then.  Bye-bye.  What about Barbie doll?  What do you have?  Carmelo don't have nothing.  He's looking to buy some Christmas Barbie doll. 
[03:05:00]  Which ones are you interested in?  Well, some of them beautiful Barbie.  Okay, honey, there's a million Barbie dolls.  Okay.  If you tell me what type you want, I may have them.  Okay, then.  What about them, Malibu?  Carmelo remember his sister used to have a Malibu Barbie, and Carmelo used to look at  that Malibu Barbie and go, what the heck?  Look at this here.  This little Barbie doll.  Okay, are you locally?  Yep.  This little Barbie.  Are you a local man?  Okay, hold on.  Could I ask you one thing about here? 
[03:05:30]  Y'all got the Beanie Baby?  You asked me the same question.  I told you I don't have Beanie Baby.  What about the Beanie Barbie?  Honey, you have a nice day.  Goodbye.  Okay.  I'm hanging up.  Goodbye.  Don't hang up and go home alone.  Oh.  Beanie, bitch.  Friday, I was in a bookstore.  I started talking to this very French-looking girl.  She was a bilingual illiterate.  She couldn't read in two different languages.  I left the store, and I went down the street to my bus. 
[03:06:00]  My bus came, and I got on.  I sat down beside this beautiful blonde Chinese girl.  I said hello, and she said hello, and I said, isn't it an amazing day?  She said, yes, it is, I guess.  I said, what do you mean, you guess?  She said, well, things haven't been going too well for me lately.  I said, like what?  She said, I can't tell you.  I didn't even know you.  I said, yeah, but sometimes it's good to tell you problems to an absolute total stranger  on a bus.  She said, well, I've just come back from my analyst, and he's still unable to help me. 
[03:06:30]  And I said, what's the problem?  And she paused and said, I'm a nymphomaniac, and I only get turned on by Jewish cowboys.  And she said, by the way, my name's Diane, and I said, hello, Diane, I'm Bucky Goldstein.  Thank you. 
[03:07:00]  All right, we're just screwing off today. 
[03:07:30]  We don't even have a staff working for us today.  Sex Bagel is out cold in the office, the brand new office.  Is he asleep?  That's just about complete.  He is out.  That figures.  Grab the mic, Ben.  He was really sleepy.  He stayed up all night. 
[03:08:00]  Yep.  All night.  Snoring.  He's snoring and everything?  And I haven't seen Steve at all.  Where's he sleeping?  Oh, no, he's talking to the porno chick.  What a surprise.  He's all excited.  He's like, check out all the new porn we're getting.  I'm like, hey, they're excited.  And you know what?  You guys didn't notice this, but Bob and I were out there talking, and Jim had to pull  his pants down and show us his ass.  Oh, he does that, too, through the window.  No, it is true.  It is true.  We all know it's true.  I mean, what are you doing?  By the way, just wanted to say to the guy that called, he had a schtick ready with the 
[03:08:30]  tape thing, which was kind of corny.  So if you want to call back and try it again, not that it doesn't have to be today, but  some other time.  But at least be a man and just don't expect me to say something and have a clip ready.  That's kind of the way a faggot would do it.  He's trying to be part of the show.  I know he is.  He's a guy who hates Jim Norton character.  Right.  Just call up.  Use your real name, dude.  Don't be a little pussy and hide behind all these different names.  Just call your real name and say what you've got to say.  All right.  Don't try to be clever.  He was prepared.  Did he get to you?  I think he got to you.  Not at all.  No.  Oh, he didn't get to you at all, right?  No. 
[03:09:00]  But he wants to be part of the show, Jim.  Look at Jim.  Jim takes everything personally on the show.  What bugs me is when somebody does something kind of like passive-aggressive like that.  I prefer someone just to call up and be a man.  But he didn't get to you at all, right?  No.  Not at all.  Okay.  Dude, if I got to you, I'd tell you.  I wouldn't lie.  Then why are we still talking about it?  Just because you're discussing something doesn't mean you're...  That was just one of those throwaway things.  It shouldn't have got to you.  It was like, oh, whatever.  You spit your gum in the barrel like Clint Eastwood in a movie.  Just...  You're pissed.  No, I just don't want my gum. 
[03:09:30]  Frenchie.  Ding.  Ding.  Ding.  Ding, guys.  What's up, Frenchie?  How you doing?  Good now.  Doing well.  I was doing good yesterday.  I had a lot of fun.  Yeah, Frenchie was part of our mission.  Yes, he was.  We were so desperate we had to recruit Frenchie as well.  I know.  A Frenchman.  We ran out of homeless people we could find.  We got as many girls as we could from the junior high school.  So, Frenchie, I saw you surrendered your sign immediately upon the police.  No, you were the first one to give your sign to the cops. 
[03:10:00]  He threw it down on the ground and put his hands up.  And then he put his hands up and then he went into the fetal position and offered to bake  them strudels and feed them for their battle.  Megan was the one that grabbed the signs back from the cops after they took the wood away.  No, but I still had mine.  I was actually going around a van and Billy Mark ran after me.  Billy, Billy Mark.  He ripped the sign off my hand.  He's like, take the wood off, take the wood off.  I'm like, what the hell are you talking about?  What am I going to do with it? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, exactly.  What is a Frenchman going to do with a weapon?  So, I'm like, okay.  He ripped it off and that was the end of it.  I mean, it's so stupid.  And Earl, Jesus Christ.  You gave him a shirt to this guy, do you think he would put it on?  No, no.  Earl was too nervous that he was going to lose his job with Infinity Broadcasting.  You know what kind of...  What an idiot.  Infinity Broadcasting hates Howie right now.  Don't worry, Earl.  Your job is safe.  And Earl is saying, well, if you looked at me, I was unmarked.  I could go anywhere I want. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  Earl is unmarked.  He's our secret agent.  Is that what it was?  He was a nice white man.  Yeah, he was emailing me.  I got great pictures.  Can't wait to send them to you.  Who cares about pictures?  Be part of it.  We just wanted the event documented, and Earl's taking Ansel Adams-type photographs.  All artsy and crap.  Yeah, he's got his big camera, his big old camera that he uses.  All he wanted was shots of our appearance there, and there's Earl trying out lenses.  No, this lens ain't good.  Putting it on a tripod. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, he's setting up a tripod.  Took pictures of people playing chess.  I finally reached my limit when he held up that big board over his head and lit off the flash powder.  You know, that took a long time to set up.  Earl and Bridges of Madison County getting the shot just right.  Perfect lighting.  Jesus, Earl.  If he had a sign in his hand, they would have arrested him.  Is it true?  By the time Earl got the photo, the camera ready, there was no one left in Union Square?  It was over. 
[03:12:00]  Actually, Earl got one picture.  It was a time-lapse shot.  But, okay, I think I'm ready now.  Earl, he left three hours ago.  This guy is...  Did he do anything for us yesterday, Frenchy?  No, he's just running around taking pictures, and that was the end of it.  He's like, he's not saying anything.  I'm like, Jesus Christ, do some fucking thing.  Yeah.  The lighting's perfect now.  All right.  Van guy from yesterday.  Thank you, Frenchy.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  I thought Jaime was driving the van.  Did we have other vans?  The part of it he was, yeah.  Van guy.  Yo.  What's going on? 
[03:12:30]  Hey, I drove the van yesterday.  The Opie and Anthony XM van.  Yeah.  First, I want to say thank you to Billy Mack for saving us.  When we first got there, I guess Howie had just finished his little speech, and the plan  was to throw the van doors open, and we had 1,000-luck speakers in the back.  Yeah.  We're going to start blasting the O&A theme song.  Yeah.  And, I mean, the cops were on us in probably about seven seconds.  Yeah.  And Jaime was fighting with the cops to get the door open, and they pulled us right over, 
[03:13:00]  and Billy Mack kind of saved us there.  Yeah.  Well, we had a bunch of guys from the NYPD helping us out, but thanks for helping us  out yesterday, bro.  Yeah.  Just so you know, too, we ended up giving out hundreds of t-shirts and wow stickers.  I mean, the van got mobbed.  Oh, I know.  All morning long.  Oh, I know.  You know, and when we pretty much took over the event there for a while, there was like,  not going to lie to you, there was like, there was booing for about five seconds,  and then that was it.  That was it.  And then people were like, oh, wow, these guys are here, too.  And then they were taking all the stuff we had to give. 
[03:13:30]  So, all right.  Thank you, Van Guy.  No problem.  See you.  All right.  Bye, mister.  Oh, Glenn's back.  Oh.  Oh.  We'll stop the show so Jim could feel good about himself.  Go ahead, Glenn.  Hey.  I just wanted to let Jim know this is my real name.  I don't hide behind anything.  Okay.  That was all.  Thanks.  And, you know, I know I sucked before.  That's why I punched out.  Good.  What were you trying to do?  You were playing a clip from a movie?  Yeah, it was Smokey and the Bandit. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, okay.  I suck.  I admit it.  No, you didn't suck.  It's all right.  It just didn't work out.  It happens.  I just can't stand Jim.  It happens.  Don't beat yourself up.  You tried to be funny with a clip, and you bombed.  I know I did.  All right.  Well, you sound like a real thrilling guy.  No, I suck.  I'll see you later.  You sure do.  Bye.  More passive-aggressive crap right there.  Yes.  Whatever.  Yeah.  I think you're going to call back right now.  I was saying in the future.  You feel better about yourself now?  I feel the same as I felt 20 minutes ago.  Mark from Virginia.  What's up? 
[03:14:30]  Hey, man.  I got to defend little Jimmy.  What's that, fella?  Hey, I got to defend little Jimmy, man.  You're the man.  Without you, man, it wouldn't be a great show.  Oh, and hey, you got a great show, man, but you got to keep little Jimmy in there.  Thank you.  We're keeping little Jimmy.  Well, Jimmy's not going anywhere.  I don't want to get fired.  We just want him to fart less.  That's all.  Hey, man.  He's got to relieve some pressure from somehow.  He can't just whip out his mule and do it right there in the show.  Thank you, sir.  That's exactly what...  And I get very excited sometimes, and it just sneaks out. 
[03:15:00]  I don't mean to ruin the show.  There you go, man.  He pops...  You're my idol, little Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  He pops boners all the time.  So what?  It's all he knows are good things.  Dude, but you have to show everyone.  He gets our attention, and he grabs onto it.  We're trying to enjoy the freaking 20-year-old stripper from L.A., and all of a sudden, we're  all like, whoa, what has he got?  And then we're looking at your hog again.  You don't have to look.  Well, when you're jumping up and down, you might have something.  I don't jump.  I just kind of point, and you guys choose to look.  I don't jump. 
[03:15:30]  He definitely tries to get your attention.  He lifts it over the edge of the console.  And rests it.  He grabs, pulls it sideways, and shakes it a little.  Yeah.  I want a little extension built around his area.  A mule hider?  Yes.  Like a sneeze guard for a...  Exactly.  A mule guard?  A mule guard?  Look, it's perfect height where he can just plop it on the table.  It does.  He lays it on there.  I do rub it against this thing.  It's perfect.  I'll have some of the Norton wiener.  You can't out-gay Norton, though.  No, it's not a gay thing when I do that. 
[03:16:00]  I'm usually turned on by a woman.  It's not like I'm just...  You can't.  If you try to...  He'll try to hug me or something.  I understand what Bob Kelly's saying, though.  Yeah.  You know, out-gay.  I mean, you like to try to get that reaction by doing something that would be perceived as  gay.  No, I don't.  One time, I actually...  You know, he does gay things once in a while, and it freaks you out.  And one time, I was like, you know what?  I'm going to out-gay him, and I actually...  You can't out-gay him.  I stuck my finger right near his butt, and he actually stopped and backed up, and my  finger went in his asshole, and I just... 
[03:16:30]  How many knuckles did he get in there?  It was one and a half.  Yeah.  It was like a little shrimp.  I could actually bend my finger.  That did not back into it.  He just stopped, and then he went like this.  Ooh.  He tried to put his finger by my ass, and it's like, look, you're going to learn a lesson  the hard way.  Why is your pants down at this point?  No, no, no.  My pants were on.  Easy, easy, Opie.  Why did he get a finger down?  We were just walking in the hallway of the apartment.  We were dressed.  I asked how many knuckles you took.  You took a knuckle and a half through the jeans?  I would actually take something real, enhance it, exaggerate it.  Therein lies the ha-ha.  Yeah, he didn't mean to put my ass. 
[03:17:00]  I didn't mean I stuck my finger in his ass.  That would be gay, wouldn't it?  He put it against my ass, and I just backed up against it to teach him who was boss.  He learned how to do it.  Well, you should have told me it was exaggerated humor.  We don't know.  I thought that's what humor was.  Not all the time.  Really?  What's the other type of humor?  Dude, we've all seen him naked, so it was quite possible that that actually happened.  I've seen him naked.  Don't look at me like I'm an alien.  That's an exaggeration, too.  I've never seen Jimmy naked.  There you go.  All right, show him your hug.  I don't want to.  No, I won't show him my hug.  I don't want to see Jimmy naked.  I love the face he gets when he gets ... I was actually with him one time, and he gets 
[03:17:30]  his face, his eyes just open wide, and his head turns down, and his upper lip goes underneath  his back tooth, and he just looks like a little troll, and he just doesn't blink, like  Christopher Walken in a scene, and he just stares at the girl like, yeah.  Yeah, that's nasty.  Oh, he does.  It's just evil.  He is.  His little body.  All right.  You know, no one's really screening the calls today.  The behind-the-scenes people are very, very slow.  Very, very slow.  Anyway, we're all tired. 
[03:18:00]  Hello, who's this?  Oh, that was good.  A hang-up.  I was on that line.  I'm going to do it myself.  Hello, who's this?  Hello?  Hey, Owen.  What?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on?  Hi, fella.  I was going to set up for what did I learn, but it's a little too early.  Yeah.  I was going to hold for a while, but it's cool.  You were going to hope to hold for about 45 minutes?  I guess so.  I'll do one a little early. 
[03:18:30]  For some reason, Jimmy Norton plays Monster Rain just fine, but today, a little sticky banana  juice got his nerves up for some reason.  Yeah, that's true.  It is inconsistent, but it freaked me.  I didn't know what it was.  It was probably sitting in the deli or something, and God knows what those savages spill on their  fruit.  By the way, we did get a brand new Monster Rain song.  How many is that?  This is at least number four.  Oh, my God.  It's not that ... It's ... It's ... It's ... It's bad.  It's good to listen.  We'll all judge.  All right.  Another Monster Rain song.  We weren't going to go to it, but ... The guys are kind of asleep behind the scenes today, 
[03:19:00]  so ...  That's right.  Look at them.  Look at them.  They're not even moving.  They all ... You know what it is?  They want to be punished.  They need discipline.  This damn Rent Boys thing has backfired.  Now everybody's fucking off, hoping to get a reading.  Steve records the thing in stereo.  Ben, we need the phone screened.  Isn't it obvious we're suffering here?  Yeah, we're tired, Ben.  Get fucking people on the phones.  I'm not even kidding anymore.  Get them on the phone, Ben.  No one is screening the calls, really.  It's like slow motion.  Get my mother back on the phone.  Have her do that ...  It's been the same. 
[03:19:30]  We got six phone lines ringing.  We got two guys that have been sitting, and it's nothing we want to go to.  It's boring shit.  Here's the Monster Rain song.  Tell me when to stop.  Let's give a listen.  It really is bad.  Let's listen along.  Oh, Neil Diamond.  Is it done to Neil Diamond?  Yeah.  Love on the porch. 
[03:20:00]  See?  So far, so good.  I was surprised A little drizzle And out came his lies  What?  Come run with me Before the dark Takes the sky  It's getting a little abstract, I think.  You took my heart You took my soul 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Real lines for that.  Gave me a little teeth And played with my own  Innocent's gone But I gave Jimmy  This smile  It's a little rough Give it like 30 more seconds  Big car  First the sky's been talking Then Jimmy starts his talking 
[03:21:00]  Suddenly you're under the porch Hiding from the storm  The fear makes him have you That he wants to have you  Nothing you can do or say Once he starts, you have to stay  It's the Monster Rain This guy's all over the place 
[03:21:30]  So we end it End it  Give me what I need  Yeah, he's breaking all the rules  Makes me know the choice  Breaking all the parody rules  Yeah, he's really singing  Some parody rules are like  First of all, you've got to be able to hear what you're saying  There's a couple of lines there that were a little  Muffled  Yeah, you couldn't really hear it  Second one  You don't use that many of the lines from the real song  Right  The guy's using too many of the real words to the song 
[03:22:00]  It's like a parody slash audition for like as a real singer  Yeah, yeah  Neil Diamond cover band  Yeah  Well, it's dug out Doug  Did you ever come up with  He does a pretty good Neil Diamond  I'll say  Did you ever have a Monster Rain story?  Did you come up with one yet?  No  You heard my story, right?  No, what was yours?  Oh, you weren't listening the other day  He had the marshmallow in the frat house  Which people are saying is just as bad as the Monster Rain  Of course it is  I was out in Arizona last week  I missed the whole show  It's one of those things where you're hazing for a fraternity 
[03:22:30]  And one of the things you got to do is  Pull the pants down, pick up a marshmallow  Yeah  With his ass  And drop it on a little mock  A rivalry  A fraternity house  Frat house  And then no one ate it?  No  No, you sick ass  Come on  But it's a room full of guys with their pants down  See, that's it?  It's a room full of guys with their pants down  Picking up things with their buttholes  Look who says that  The guy that put a finger in my ass  Well, he didn't  Well, I guess my cracky did 
[03:23:00]  No, he had your pants on  Yeah, but I felt the actual shrimp hole  The actual  Separation  Yeah, the separation  I'm guessing there's a Bob Kelly story  That bombs you?  I thought it was a little odd  That frats do things like that  And have guys in these nude circumstances  Doing things  Yeah, I think it's a little odd  There's definitely a Bob Kelly story  Yeah, there's definitely a Bob Kelly story  Now, let me just get this straight  Is it like just pure molestation?  Does it have to be a guy?  Or can it be a girl or an aunt?  No, we all have girl stories 
[03:23:30]  How old would the boy be?  And how old would the aunt be?  Oh, jeez  What the hell is an aunt?  I don't like it either  It's from Boston  I'm from aunt  It's an aunt  Aunt  What do you say, aunt?  Yeah, aunt  If I say aunt, then he's going to go what?  And then it's going to be like a whole back and forth  You know, who's on first?  Aunt  Aunt  Oh, marshmallios  Listen  My aunt, aunt  What?  What?  Aunt  I've done a couple things  I guess we were talking about things that could be  Yeah, you got to do the gay one  Looked at as 
[03:24:00]  A little gee  A little gee  A little gee  Well, I used to  I got shards of glass  You broke a CD and it just made shards  You alright?  Yeah, I'll be alright  That's what you get  Alright, relax  Easy  And I should settle down, huh?  Settle down  Settle down  Why don't you settle down  Find a girl like Henry  Tell us your gay story  It's not gay  Only the good half  It's not gay because it was young  Settle down every night, man  It was young  You were young  Yeah, well, that's the whole monster ain excuse Jimmy gives 
[03:24:30]  Is it's not gay because he was young  Well, it's true  Everybody  Four out of five young boys have done stuff with their buddies' pee-pees  When they're young  Because you don't know what sex is yet  And the fifth one watches  That's what my therapist told me  Really?  Yeah, that it's pretty natural  Really?  So when you were, how old were you and whatever  So I guess I'm not normal  Oh yeah, you are  You're so normal, you probably repressed it  But there's a normal memory there  I honestly couldn't give you one though  It's gonna come out someday  Well, I forgot all about the marshmallow story 
[03:25:00]  So I guess we'll see  I'm sure there's more in there  All right, go ahead  How old were you?  How old was I?  I think I was, I had to be in first grade  First grade  First grade  That's six?  Actually, yeah, it was before first grade  My first sexual experience with a woman was in first grade  And with this chick, the blouse  This local whore  And she made me suck  Whore?  Yeah, the blouse  How old was she?  She was like, she had to be like 14  Oh  So she was older  And she took me in the bushes  Yeah  And made me suck on her tits  And then she played with my little mushroom 
[03:25:30]  Like she just played with it  Wow  And I went home  What a little whore  I actually cried all night  Because I thought God was gonna punish me  And he was going to  And he did  What a good Catholic  I remember me and my  You cried all night because of that?  Well, you know, I was raised Catholic  Of course  And I didn't know  She's touching me and I'm sucking  She made me do this stuff  I was molested  You were molested  That's molested  And then I went home that night  And I was just crying in my bed  Just crying, praying for God 
[03:26:00]  Please forgive me  I'm sorry  This is bad  Are you kidding?  My mother actually came up  She was like, honey, what's wrong?  I was like, nothing  I'm just, you know, I had a bad dream  And I just cried all night  I just felt bad  Thank you, man  Sorry, I just had to, you know  Make this story a little more fun  Yeah  Porn  Porn  Porn  Alright, so you're crying in bed  Let dirty boy finish your story  Well, you know, it's funny  It's like a week later  I actually  You do understand it was your fault 
[03:26:30]  It was my fault  Yeah  Why?  It was your fault  She took me into the bush  Looking all sexy  What are you expecting?  You parade that little hairless jewel around  Who wouldn't touch it for Pete's sake?  Jesus  She used to take me into Tufts University  And after that, I kind of got into it  And I used to grab my friend Matthew  We used to go up into the attic of Tufts University  And just each one of us would grab  She was fat  Just fat and huge tits  And each one of us would just suck on a tit  Wow 
[03:27:00]  Like little babies  Like little babies  You were little babies  Yeah  It was just this hot, sweaty attic  And this fat chick  And she was just sweating  And me and him would just both grab one of our huge tits  And just suck on a flex  And was she getting pleasure out of this?  Was she moaning or something?  No, not really  She would just sit there  Sometimes she'd smoke during it  Smoke?  I swear to God  She'd just light up a cigarette  It was weird  Like she would just do it with everybody  My first three chicks were just fat white chicks  The blouse, Kimba  And some other chick  I don't know 
[03:27:30]  Kimba  Kimba, yeah  She would just  Where's the guy thing come in?  Oh, when I was before  The way to get the gay out  He was trying to tell chick stories  And you're like  Where's the guy stuff?  I kind of liked the blouse story  Yeah, thanks, man  That was nice  I mean, Ope  Sorry  Nice talking to you  Wanted to, you know  Keep you on track  Alright  Well, you know what happened  Is that me and my friend  We would go over to  He would come over to my house  Because both of my parents worked  And my sister would be out  So we'd just lie on the couch  Uh-oh  That's already sound  And  Oh, boy  Buckle up 
[03:28:00]  Buckle up  Here comes another monster rain  This is way beyond monster rain  I can sense it  I don't know why you call it monster rain  Why don't you just call it  Sucking each other's cocks  And being friends  Well, the more  The more I look at it  The more I realize  That there probably was  No such thing as monster rain  I've come to that conclusion  Oh, really?  You're backing out of stuff now?  What are you saying?  No  I didn't know that you guys  Grew up together  No, easy  But I was saying  If me and him were buddies  When we were a kid  We'd have some  Dude, remember that time  I banged you on your ass?  Alright, listen  That wasn't gay though 
[03:28:30]  I talked to my therapist  That's not gay  We just didn't know any better  We're friends, you know  I didn't know  Alright, so  So you and your friend  Would lie on the couch  We'd lie on the couch  Just before I  How old was he?  Uh, 13  How old were you?  No, I'm joking  He was, uh  Ah, shit  We had to be  We had to be  How old were you in 5th grade?  How old were you in 5th grade?  11  11  I don't know  Depends what color you are  No, not 11  11  No, it wasn't 11  What color you are  You were 11 years old  Hang on  I didn't even hear that  That's so bad  That's good  Um

Yeah  Yeah  So you're 11 in 5th grade  It must have been  You were 11  4th grade  I wasn't 11  Because I started drinking  At 11  10 or 11  And I wasn't drinking then  Of course you started drinking  This is my first addiction  This is my first addiction  Then I moved on to booze  So what happened  When you were almost a teenager  You were laying on the couch  You lie on the couch  We just lie there  And this is when  Remember when you first 
[03:29:30]  Started jerking off  You used Vaseline  Yes  Remember like petroleum jelly  Sure  You would like waterproof your dick  For like 3 days  Just jump in the shower  To wash it off  And it would just beat up  Yeah  Just looking for anything  Slippery  At that age  Didn't matter  Run around like a monkey  Just looking what?  Pancake batter?  I don't care  Whatever word  I jerked off with anything  Anything  Anything  I used to jerk off  With the Juergens  And I'd fuck the sink  You ever fuck the sink?

You want a little resistance 
[03:32:00]  You want a little resistance  Because it cracks it  And you're like  Oh  And it feels like  You're cracking the seal  Of a stink wrinkle  Just as it's going in  Oh it's unbelievable  Right now  There's a sink in therapy  Somewhere  I just wanted to clean people  And help  And wash them  And this fat kid  Would climb on  And put his dinghy  In my face  Well  I was in the bathroom  Where I usually am  And the lights came on  These are great distractions  So what happened  With the guy  On the couch  Yeah it's true  So uh  Fucking the sink  I've never heard of that

[03:59:00]  That's shocking  Holy fuck  I need coffee  You have an outie  This is the best show  The game that was born on the radio  Now joins the next generation of radio  XM Satellite Radio is now the official satellite service of Major League Baseball  Starting in 2005  XM will bring you live play-by-play from every MLB team  All season long  From spring training through the World Series  Now you can hear your hometown team wherever you are  All part of your basic monthly XM plan 
[03:59:30]  Major League Baseball  Coming to XM in 2005  It's radio to the power of X  The technophile  Hi I'm Laszlo  Before it was only crazy people who walked down the street talking to themselves  But now you see it on a regular basis  Headsets for mobile phones come in all shapes and sizes  And some people like to walk around with their headset in all the time  Like they're in the Secret Service or something  Recently I checked out one called Jawbone  That monitors the vibrations of your head  Your head vibrates when you talk 
[04:00:00]  And you can actually feel that if you just hold your hand up to the top of your head  That's Hossein Raman  The Jawbone monitors the vibrations from your head  So it knows when you're talking  What we do is we combine that information about when you're speaking  Because what it tells us is it tells us exactly when you're speaking  And when you're not speaking  So we combine that information with information from two microphones  That are scanning your background environment  One's looking for your voice  And the other one's looking for the noise  The noise cancelling technology must be good  Because the Jawbone is just as expensive as a phone  The headset will run you $150 
[04:00:30]  For more go to Jawbone.com  I'm L-A-Z-L-O-W.com  And that's what's on my underground hard drive  Hi this is Tom Torbjornson  With America's Car Show  Tip of the Day on XM Radio  A couple of years back here in Buffalo, New York  We had a massive snowstorm hit one afternoon  In 24 hours over 6 feet of snow fell  Cars stuck everywhere including my daughter's for 17 hours  She was completely unprepared  Here's what she should have had in her vehicle that day 
[04:01:00]  Emergency food and water to keep hydrated and nourished  Thermal blanket, warm socks, boots she had high heels on  Body warming pads, rain gear in case she had to walk outside  You know hypothermia is the number one killer of stranded motorists in winter weather  Flashlight, extra batteries  Check my website for special emergency auto kits  With winter weather supplement  That we put together based on recommendations of experts  On surviving emergency situations in vehicles  Got a question?
