<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic and highly offensive mix of segments loosely connected by recurring themes and the hosts' unrestrained vulgarity.  A significant portion focused on the fallout from Long Island radio DJ Randy Spears' apology for jokes targeting the town of Mastic. Opie and Anthony vehemently criticized the station for forcing the apology, employing extremely offensive language to describe Mastic and its residents, frequently contrasting it with wealthier Long Island areas.  This segment heavily involved listener calls, further contributing to the derogatory portrayal of Mastic and culminating in a "Get to Know Mastic" segment soliciting listener-submitted facts (positive and negative) about the town.  The name "Smothergill," the president of the Mastic Chamber of Commerce, became a recurring punchline.  The hosts also briefly mentioned a separate, vaguely described story about a potential mass HIV and Hepatitis infection.

The show also included a "Mastic Moments" segment featuring listener calls detailing various bizarre and criminal occurrences in Mastic, including a naked drunk woman, a bow-and-arrow murder, and a feces-filled room with numerous dogs.  This was interspersed with discussions about a potentially fake video of a Marine throwing a puppy off a cliff, the video's removal from YouTube, and a feud with Cleveland radio DJ Maxwell, who downplayed the impact of "pests" (Opie and Anthony's listeners) on his station despite evidence of their actions (removed phone numbers, a hijacked MySpace page).  Audio clips of Maxwell were played for comedic effect.

The broadcast featured in-studio guests Nick DiPaolo and Louis C.K., promoting a comedy festival, and promoted Anthony Cumia's sexually suggestive "speed dating extravaganza" and a "hot teen lesbian Pocono party."  Winners of a radio animation contest were announced, and an upcoming animation festival was discussed.  The show also delved into other unrelated controversies, including Rush Limbaugh's reaction to a caller comparing Barack Obama to Curious George, and an alleged vulgarity used by Jane Fonda during a public appearance.  The hosts speculated on the authenticity of the Limbaugh audio and offered their opinions on both controversies.

Another segment involved a prank call, initially believed to be from Randy Spears, that was revealed to be from Ron and Fez. This transitioned into conversations with callers about sex, relationships, and personal experiences, marked by highly offensive and sexually explicit language and insults directed at callers. The hosts also discussed the perceived need for a black co-host on morning television to avoid racial controversies, using Don Imus as an example, further escalating into vulgar and offensive racial commentary and discussions of apologies.  Finally, Eastside Dave, a regular contributor, concluded the show with a bizarre on-air stunt involving a lollipop and his rectum, met with further crude commentary.  A significant portion featured a caller, Tammy, who was relentlessly mocked for her apparent lack of knowledge about cartoons and popular culture, using highly offensive and misogynistic language, with the hosts eventually "firing" her.  The entire broadcast was characterized by its consistent use of racial slurs, misogynistic and homophobic language, and graphic descriptions of bodily functions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  There was some dude who liked horses and liked the radio show and named his horses after us.  And then let him starve.  And then let him starve?  Great.  I like what we're doing to the listeners.  Starving them of entertainment.  They are sick, freak!  Bobby, please, there's one part we want you to see.  That's easy. 
[00:01:00]  Are you okay?  Where entertainment is going?  These guys are watching porn.  Oh, Jesus.  What are we talking about?  Oh, my God.  We're done.  We're out.  What is this?  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  There it is. 
[00:01:30]  It's A, not B, Tim.  E.  Oh, boy.  Ah.  Ah, good morning.  Hi.  Morning.  Something else doesn't sound right.  No, something sounds a little tinny.  Something sounds a little tinny there, Tim.  A little tinny.  Here's the part where I take my headphones off a little bit because I don't want to hear a...  That'll make my head sound like I'm listening into a seashell.  Don't push that.  How about I push this?  What about this?  No? 
[00:02:00]  No.  Sounds a little off.  Wow.  It sounds tinny.  And why were you running down the halls yelling and screaming and making weird noises all morning?  I don't think I was.  What was I doing?  What was that?  No.  It was the werewolf.  It was you, Tim.  They were making fun of you.  I like to make Tim movies.  You were making weird noises as you were running down the hall.  Didn't even realize.  Maybe you weren't running.  Oh, he didn't realize. 
[00:02:30]  Everything's a goddamn catchphrase around here.  All right.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Sounds a bit bassy, but we'll go with it.  Yeah, we'll deal with it.  Maybe look around, make sure all the buttons are where they're supposed to be.  Yeah.  All right.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  ONA Radio.com.  Another fine thing we should be promoting every day.  Lovely site.  Great site.  I was on it.  The way the videos are set up, everything is easy to get there.  It's perfect.  Perfect.  The perfect site. 
[00:03:00]  It's not perfect because they still have a problem with some of the edgier stuff.  They got to wake up and let us get a little edgier with ONA Radio.com.  Yeah, it's a website.  But for the most part, it does a good job for this radio show.  Covers all the bases.  That's right.  Well, we start the show by talking about another DJ.  Yeah.  Yeah, this guy.  Yeah.  We like informing everybody about radio guys, radio shows, radio stations. 
[00:03:30]  Especially the groveling DJ.  Oh, the North American groveling DJ.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, they just have to get out there and grovel for their jobs.  We once had to read a statement on the air with a gun to our head.  Yeah.  And that's that.  And then a statement was later made saying, whatever statements we ever have to read in the future are lies.  We want to get that out immediately. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, because we had it.  We've had it.  I mean, we don't want to play this game anymore.  We're just apologizing for stuff when you're just trying to entertain an audience.  That's going to work.  Yeah, you do a comedy show, a little comedy talk show.  And like I said in the little opener there, it's put in the same category as news and all these things where people would get in trouble for saying something outrageous.  But we're goofing.  Yes.  We're like a comedy show.  Well, last week, Jimmy, you weren't here because Jimmy's outraged.  I'm like, weren't you here for this? 
[00:04:30]  I'm like, oh, yeah, I guess he wasn't.  And he would have really enjoyed this.  There's a dopey show out there on Long Island.  It's WBLI.  You know, being a Long Islander, I know I know BLI.  It's a powerhouse.  It does a fine job.  It plays pretty much, I guess, hits, hit music.  And they got a wacky morning show.  And the wacky morning show, all they're trying to do is entertain people as they go to work on Long Island.  Well, this guy, I forgot his name already.  Randy?  Randy.  This guy, Randy, as part of... 
[00:05:00]  Randy Spears.  Randy Spears.  Randy, who's part of the morning show, got Mastic mad at him.  Yeah, the little town of Mastic out there on Long Island is all mad because of some of his statements.  I guess he took a call.  Right, just to bring everyone on board here.  Randy Spears apologized to Mastic area residents for denigrating them on the air, telling them yesterday their community is a sweet little town. 
[00:05:30]  Mastic is not a sweet little town.  We've been there.  We took horrific phone calls about what goes on in Mastic.  Residents of Mastic were calling up and just talking about...  And these are people that live there.  Yeah.  Talking about how awful it is.  We had one guy, he goes, could you please...  He goes, I know you guys make a good living.  Could you please just buy my house?  Yeah, he's trying to sell his house.  Just get me out of here.  It's just awful.  And then we looked up the sexual predators in Mastic and it lights up like a Christmas tree. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, it was wonderful.  We got yellows, we got reds, we got blues, we got greens.  It's like a broken traffic light.  Yeah.  Just flashing predator.  A contrite Spears appearing at a news conference.  He didn't want to do this.  Contrite.  You have to be contrite.  He didn't want to do this, by the way.  By the way, it's exactly...  You're exactly right.  The guy hated doing this.  He didn't...  No one changes their tune in a matter of days. 
[00:06:30]  You don't sit there and make a joke and then go, that was so inappropriate.  I should drive around Mastic and see that it's a nice place and then apologize to everybody.  You do that for self-preservation.  He's trying to save his job.  Yeah.  Which, you know, whatever.  But he didn't change his mind.  He still hates you.  And how it works, if you're on Long Island, you just know the good towns and the bad towns.  Right.  Simple as that.  It's like anywhere else in the country.  And it gets ingrained in your head.  How about Manhattan here? 
[00:07:00]  Everyone jokes about Harlem, Harlem, Harlem.  Yeah.  You know, well, guess what?  Harlem is coming around finally.  Yeah.  Still not a place where I'm going to go and have dinner and a movie, but...  And there's areas you won't go to.  But it's starting to come around.  As far as Mastic goes, I'll give it another 10 years and then I'll have an open mind and  I'll go through there and see if things have drastically changed.  But as far as I know, from my experience on Long Island, Mastic is not a place you'd want  to drive through.  It's not a nice place to go.  Sorry.  And this kid, he's probably older than us, this Randy Spears, he knows that. 
[00:07:30]  But he had to save his job because his radio station and his management over there, you  know, put the gun to his head basically.  Didn't back him.  You either do this or we're firing you.  Yep.  Which is just such a wimp move by the radio station.  When's the last time a station backed talent?  Oh my God.  Like any situation.  When's the last time?  Had to be...  Maybe...  Had to be Tom Chiasano and CBS Radio when Opie and Anthony had some homeless guy on. 
[00:08:00]  That wasn't even something that happened to CBS.  They did stand by us, but they had no reason not to.  I mean...  Yeah, because it wasn't on this station.  They can only back you if it never went over their airwaves.  Good point.  Good point.  A contrite spear is appearing on a news conference.  He had to do a whole news conference and everything.  Hosted by local politicians.  And I saw the picture of this guy apologizing in the paper.  He's standing right next to a lady that had greasy hair, five chins, a horrible pantsuit 
[00:08:30]  on.  It's stereotypical.  If you look at that picture, it's stereotypical what they call white trash.  Look at this woman.  The greasy hair, big fatty.  That is...  You know, if you made a trailer park remark, and by some miracle, I don't know how this  happened, there aren't any trailer parks in Mastic?  I guess.  I guess.  Because of zoning.  Yeah.  How about that?  Whatever.  Who knew?  But I'm sure that's even better, because I'm sure, like a lot of the houses, they should 
[00:09:00]  probably have trailer parks on the plots.  In its place.  Sure.  Sure.  You know, if I was going to represent Mastic at this press conference as his DJ is apologizing  and groveling, I would have hired supermodels.  Supermodels to walk around with Mastic shirts on.  Yeah.  Mastic, whatever.  High school.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, is this the story?  Yeah.  He's everywhere today.  Look at him.  He's pathetic.  Apologizing.  Apologizing. 
[00:09:30]  I'm sorry to Mastic.  Yeah.  Look at the mess he's sitting next to.  Unbelievable.  Oh, God.  And he's reading a statement, because he doesn't mean that.  He's all nervous.  So, anyway.  He looks like Hitchcock with a Paul McCartney wig.  What a slob.  She's slobbery.  So, he apologized for the remarks and noted that William Floyd, for whom the area's high  school is named, was the first New York signer of the Declaration of Independence.  Wow.  Who gives a crap? 
[00:10:00]  That's good.  So, you've got to go back a couple hundred years to find anything worthwhile.  Well, that's, I mean, yeah.  If that's the best you can do, your town is in deep trouble.  Yeah.  It's like the Chris Rock joke about MLK Boulevard.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  MLK did some great things, but you don't want to be hanging out on his boulevards anytime  soon.  Run!  Right.  And the first New York signer of the Declaration of Independence and a school was named after  him?  Yeah.  You could give me, somebody who lives in a horrible neighborhood, please call up and tell me 
[00:10:30]  about a school or a park that is named after some kind of American hero.  Yeah.  What's your, what's the name of your school?  Right.  They don't pick like the John Wayne Gacy school.  Right.  Of course.  It's always some kind of a icon or like, I don't even know what that means.  Who cares that the high school was named after the first New York signer of the Declaration  of Independence?  What does that mean?  Are they proud of that?  Why put it there?  Seriously, what does that mean?  Why is it in the story?  My high school was named after John Glenn. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  The astronaut.  Right.  Thank you.  What does that mean?  My high school was named after Mr. Harborfields.  Who's Harborfields?  I don't know.  I don't know the town.  We just couldn't come up with anybody, so we just came out.  Fields next to the harbor.  Yeah, I guess.  Something like that.  I guess.  But, you know, they sat around and went, well, let's get some good, you know, info about  Mastic out there.  What do we got?  What do we got?  That's it?  Well, the high school's named after William Floyd.  How about economic stats?  Right. 
[00:11:30]  Start quoting some of those.  Most in the audience, which included county legis, Kate Browning, Brookhaven Town Councilman  Keith Romain, and several Mastic civic leaders applauded the apology.  And the Cloverfield monster.  Yeah.  With greasy hair and horrible woman.  But some said Spears needs to cover more positive news about Mastic before he earns forgiveness.  He has to cover more positive news about Mastic.  They're like telling him he's got to do good Mastic stories. 
[00:12:00]  And the manager of the radio station sat there and let these wannabe politicians, you know,  slap their DJ around.  Oh, man.  Dude, what a collection of worms we have become.  This business blows.  Americans are eunuchs.  We're a bunch of eunuchs.  And our idea of getting something done is catching a guy saying something wrong and then berating  him and whipping him into doing what we want.  Into saying, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  We needed that joke.  Pathetic.  And then you got this guy, Mark Smothergill.  Karen!  You got this guy, Mark Smothergill, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Mastics and  Shirley.  Yeah.  Of the Mastics and Shirley.  He goes, what happened today other than this man has a secure job?  Like, he's mad.  He wants more.  He's mad.  He wants some fire.  He wants more from this.  Spears of Ronkonkoma, a resident, issued the apology at Mastic Park. 
[00:13:00]  Ronkonkoma?  And he's talking?  Jesus!  Issued the apology at Mastic Fire Department headquarters in front of about 80 people.  He sparked controversy on Wednesday.  Jimmy, do you know what he said?  A caller got through from Mastic.  Here's how horrible he was.  Listen to this.  This person was trying to win a prize.  So this guy, Randy, whose job is to try to come up with some edgy, funny stuff, says,  Oh, you're from Mastic?  Are your pipes freeze under the trailer? 
[00:13:30]  That's a common occurrence with trailers.  You know the pipe freeze.  But that's all he said, basically, assuming this person lived in a trailer.  That's a joke.  Mark Smothergill wants him fired.  Smothergill.  Yeah, Mark Smothergill.  Oh, what an awful name.  Of the Smothergills.  I'm from the Mastic Smothergills.  I'm Mark Smothergill, and I approve this self-inflicted gunshot wound.  Mark Smothergill is a deuce. 
[00:14:00]  That's a name just built for the White House, isn't it?  President Smothergill.  And now, President Smothergill.  Hello.  I'm Mark Smothergill.  And I don't know how to have fun.  Mark Smothergill is a dork.  He stinks.  That's the remark.  That's it.  That's it.  Your pipes freeze under the trailer.  He asked a question, and they all laughed like, ha, ha, ha.  Hardy har.  And then she said something like, well, I don't live in a trailer.  And then that was pretty much it.  And they called it a C word. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Oh, damn it.  Maybe that was it.  Beth Wall, President of William Floyd Community Summit, said many listeners in working class  Mastic interpreted Spears' comments as stereotyping their community because of its economic status.  Yep.  All right.  Well, so be it.  Sorry.  You're broke.  You're a broke-ass town.  You're not allowed to make fun of a town?  Why not?  A town you can't make fun of anymore.  Because we're eunuchs.  A little dotted line on a map.  You can't make fun of it. 
[00:15:00]  Paul Brushard.  Paul Brushard.  You're right.  Director of the Pattersquash Creek Civic Association.  Blow this whole place off the map.  Could you please carpet bomb Mastic?  Paul Brushard, director of the Pattersquash Creek Civic Association.  Better known as PCCA.  The PCCA.  What is Paul Brushard's relationship to Mark Smothergill? 
[00:15:30]  Smothergill.  I think they're in an alternative couple.  They're in the asinine name society.  Hello, Smothergill.  What the hell?  Well, let's see what Paul Brushard, director of the Pattersquash Creek Civic Association,  had to say.  Point out that trailer homes are not permitted under local zoning laws.  I have nothing against trailer parks.  Too high income.  And over the Fordham.  Sorry, there's a roof.  You have to sleep outdoors, garbage. 
[00:16:00]  Fast forward.  I'm sorry for calling people garbage.  I apologize to garbage for associating with the Smothergills.  Why don't you die?  Garbage is nothing but harmless cans and tidbits in plastic bags and should not be connected  to the people of Mastic.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Hook up a teepee and sleep under that.  You zilch.  Exactly.  Smothergill. 
[00:16:30]  Wait, wait.  Where are we?  Oh, I have nothing against trailer parks.  I lived in one, Spears told the crowd.  Now he has to, like, grovel.  Oh, I was molested in one.  I have nothing against trailer parks.  Trail of parks, whiskey breath really gets me going.  My emotions.  Ed from Jersey, this stuff is like...  Razor stubble.  I have nothing against trailer parks, whiskey breath, or a friendly friend.  It's time to watch me.  Ed from Jersey, this stuff is like modern day witch trials.  It absolutely is.  Just to get serious for a second.  Absolutely. 
[00:17:00]  Yep.  Arrival station, WDRE.  Uh-oh.  105.3.  Saw an opportunity here.  Is capitalizing on the controversy by making...  This is just as bad as the other stuff.  Here it goes.  Oh, no.  By making this Mastic Shirley Appreciation Month...  What hacks?  Are you guys starting to understand how much this business sucks?  Horrid.  Take me away from this crap.  Mastic Shirley?  John Caracciolo. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, we know this dude.  He tried to hire us back in the day.  John Caracciolo, president of the Syosset-based Maury organization that owns DRE.  They're actually nice people over there, but still a hacky bit.  But still, what a hacky thing to do.  Said the company made the decision to hold the Appreciation Month as soon as it heard that  another station was slandering Mastic Shirley.  Whoa.  I never...  Listeners were calling and wanting to express their opinions, and we wanted to give them  the outlet to do so, Caracciolo said.  Did they get the same call as we got?  Oof.  Spears also read his apology on BLI yesterday morning. 
[00:18:00]  John Shea, the station's vice president and general manager...  Oh, did I give him a beating on Friday, Jimmy?  Good.  Said Spears would probably not have been allowed to return if he hadn't apologized.  God, I hate this John Shea.  Wow.  Yeah, you apologize or you're not welcome back here.  Way to go, John.  Good.  Did you take his genitals and, as they're removed, just tack them to your wall with a  collection of the rest of the people you've just emasculated? 
[00:18:30]  Including himself.  Yeah.  Believe me, he's got no...  Oh, his are up on the wall, too.  Let me tell you something about John Shea.  He's just another failed DJ, and his whole job is to figure out what hits to play.  And usually you find that on the internet and go, okay, here's the list of hits, guys.  Just play this.  Play them.  Just play this.  Don't deviate.  I'm going to go in my office and dream about being a DJ.  I got to put a fire out now.  I failed miserably, so now I just got to sit here and make sure the hits are being played.  La-de-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, phone call from Mastic.  Phone call from Mastic!  What am I going to do?  Yeah, he probably lost his mind.  Not Mark Smothergill!  Do you know what this is going to do?  Hey guys, is Mark Smothergill on the phone?  Oh, God.  Is that Mark Smothergill?  What am I going to do?  Oh, my God.  I'm going to...  Okay, I'll be okay.  All right, I'll be...  Hello, Mark Smothergill?  Excuse me, Mr. Smothergill is holding.  Oh, Jesus.  Not Smothergill.  Oh, no.  Not Mark Smothergill.  Smothergill's a tough customer. 
[00:19:30]  John Shea's a douche.  I hate him.  Old vinegar breath.  He sucks.  Oh, what a loser you are, John Shea.  You weren't going to allow him to return for him.  You weren't going to allow him to return unless he read the apology.  He's saying, do your pipes freeze under your trailer?  Oh, you're pathetic.  You insinuate a lot when you...  Spears said he is scheduled to return to his normal work today.  He said he took five days to issue an apology because, you ready for this?  He needed time to think and needed to say the right thing. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  No.  You don't want to say the wrong thing.  No, they took him off the air and then they had some kind of lawyer write up a statement  and then they handed it to him and said, read this.  What about the zombies in the woods?  Yeah, what about the zombies in the woods?  They just hop out and grab people, drag them back into the woods and sexually assault them.  Yeah.  What about that?  What's that music?  It's scary.  What is that?  It's the mall music from Dawn of the Dead, right?  Oh, because they're zombies. 
[00:20:30]  I get it.  But they don't have a mall in Mastic.  Yes, we do.  We have a strip store.  It has a hardware store.  And a delicatessen.  Boy, do I want to talk to this Mark Smothergill.  Where's Smothergill?  Get me Mark Smothergill immediately.  He's away from his desk.  He's in a rest area drilling a hole in a booth.  But he'll be back shortly.  Just kidding, folks.  I would like to apologize to the Smothergills. 
[00:21:00]  That's what Mark Smothergill does.  He goes from rest area to rest area, making sure that the holes in the booth are the proper size.  Right.  With a little ruler.  A tool.  It's one small that could chafe.  Hey, we got Asbury Park checking in.  Now, let me tell you about Asbury Park.  It's a hell hole.  Now, I haven't been there in, let's call it about six years, I think.  Yep, the last time we were there.  So, things might have changed.  But my opinion still of Asbury Park is two things.  Bruce Springsteen played there one effing time, 25-some-odd odd. 
[00:21:30]  Shut up!  Pony.  How about you let us talk?  Man, you're throwing me off.  Yeah.  So, you've got Springsteen who played there 20-some-odd years ago.  And it's a hell hole.  That's all I know about Asbury Park.  Warzone.  Yo.  What's up?  Yeah.  No, it's just like, you know what I'm saying?  You guys know what it is about Asbury Park and about any other surrounding bad area.  It is what it is, man.  Take it up and stop crying.  Yo, damn.  I know.  People don't get killed in Asbury.  There are bad areas. 
[00:22:00]  Sorry.  Everything isn't the same.  We'd love everything to be the same and everybody to have the same economic level.  But some cities and towns are wealthier than others.  Exactly.  And if there's an impoverished town and you have a comedy show and you goof on the fact  that probably the town's having some problems, you shouldn't have to have your job threatened.  Absolutely.  Oh, God.  And we still got more guns than Anthony.  I'm working on it, Pally. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Don't you worry.  We could talk all peaceful now, but, you know, when it goes down, my brother.  Hey, yo, we're coming for our 40 acres in the Mule and I'm coming for Yellow Air first.  You got it, bro.  All right, sir.  You come.  Come and get me.  We got to take our first break.  But first, I know it's the Mule they want because you're an ass.  Yeah.  Tony Long Island, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Here's a lingo longer.  Didn't you guys talk about a guy getting, a retarded kid getting anally raped at the bowling alley? 
[00:23:00]  Whoa, hey, slow down a little bit.  Yeah, I don't think he could be so graphic.  So graphic.  There was a retarded boy who was sodomized in a bathroom of a bowling alley.  Not sure if it was Mastic.  I'm not sure if it was Mastic.  We'll look it up really fast.  We'll look that up.  E-Rock?  Let's see if Smothergill.  I'm not asking for anything.  I'm just.  Maybe we could call Mark Smothergill and ask him if he knows anything about that.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Smothergill.  Let's go to Steven Mastic.  Steve. 
[00:23:30]  Hello, is it me?  Hi, Steve.  It's you.  What do you think?  There's another Steven Mastic on the phone?  There you go.  Oh.  No, I don't live in.  I live in Queens now.  I moved.  Oh, all right.  I'm sorry.  I just want to say a good thing about it was the football team is 33 undefeated, 33 games in a row.  Right.  And two of the William Floyd cheerleaders went on to become playboy playmates.  Hey.  Oh, you know, the team is undefeated because you got 25-year-old, you know, seniors.  Oh, now you're going to have to apologize to the school.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry. 
[00:24:00]  The students, the football team, you're implying perhaps that they got left back?  A few times.  A few times?  Sure.  My God.  You're evil.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Let's say hi to Ray and Shirley, which is very close to Mastic.  What's up?  Oh, Ray.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hi.  I live out there in Shirley.  I live in the northern part up by Long Island Expressway.  We don't even consider ourselves Shirley.  We call ourselves East Yatang.  Yeah.  Disassociated. 
[00:24:30]  Disassociated from that whole area because when you hit Montauk Highway and you go south,  it is basically a trailer park.  But they don't call them trailers because they're modulars.  They're homes that came in on trailers from out of the states.  They put them up and they put them on a foundation.  Prefabs.  Yeah.  So are you trying to say that they actually look like trailers but they're just not called trailers?  That's right.  But if you built a concrete wall around the wheels, there you go.  It's a house on a foundation.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Listen to this.  Tommy in Kings Park. 
[00:25:00]  This is too good.  We're late for a break, but screw it.  What's up, Tommy?  Hey, how you doing?  It's Dominic.  I was just saying they made him actually research and write a report like a sixth-grade kid for information on Mastic.  Oh, my God.  For the press conference he did.  You had to write a report.  Are you kidding me?  I was listening to the radio station yesterday and they were saying that he was writing a report as if he was a sixth-grade kid.  My summer vacation in Mastic. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, my God.  First, I was dragged into the woods and sexually assaulted by the multitude of predators in the area.  By the woods people.  The woods zombies that I've read about.  The woods zombies.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Ryan in Boston.  Let's see the zombies again.  Mastic's GDP is $20.  Ryan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Just wanted to point out, is it just me or is Smothergill? 
[00:26:00]  Wasn't he in an episode of Scooby-Doo or something?  I think it's Mr. Smothergill.  Oh, yeah, they ripped the mask off him and he's the villain?  Smothergill?  It was you the whole time.  Watch it out, fellas.  Smothergill.  Let's go to show.  Yeah, uh-uh.  Let's go to show.  It can't be fun if that's your name.  No.  Let's go to show in North Carolina.  Yeah.  The last caller was wrong.  Smothergill teaches wizardry at Hogwarts.  You think he's a professor at Hogwarts? 
[00:26:30]  At Hogwarts.  Professor Smothergill.  I want that Potter in my class.  That kid's got nice legs.  I want Harry Potter in a pair of shorts in my office for three minutes.  Yes, Professor Smothergill.  Bring me the Potter boy and tell him to wear a tank top that reveals his belly button.  Professor Smothergill.  I'm going to put a spell on Randy Spears.  Professor Smothergill's face is on that website again.  Megan something or other. 
[00:27:00]  Could you get Smothergill on the phone?  Where's Smothergill?  He was trying.  I'm trying to get Smothergill.  Here's the news story, by the way.  We should play this about 25 minutes ago.  Randy Spears, co-host of Long Island's WBLI morning show, came under fire last week after  making trailer park jokes about people living in Mastic.  He was pulled off the air last Thursday.  At first, Spears refused to apologize, but yesterday met with residents.  It's face-to-face. 
[00:27:30]  And when I made those statements, I was just trying to have fun with the listeners like  I usually do.  It was not my intention to hurt an entire community.  Randy Spears says he spent the weekend driving around and found out that there are no trailer  parks in Mastic.  He spent the weekend driving around Mastic.  Can I explain something?  It takes 10 minutes.  Yes.  You see the hillbillies that get upset about this.  Yeah.  Part of comedy is exaggeration. 
[00:28:00]  We have to be literal in our language, I guess.  And I hate to say that the Yankees played the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and they didn't really  kill them.  Right, right.  The paper says that they killed them, but they didn't actually murder them.  Yeah.  I think we should be very literal in our speech.  No worry there.  Yeah.  I'm more pissed at John Shea, the station manager of the station, the station manager  of BLI.  Oh, my God.  And the radio station itself.  Dude, let me clear this up.  What, what, what?  The Post, just to clear up any misconceptions.  Oh, yeah.  It has a picture of Barack and Hillary on the front and it says, hi, noon. 
[00:28:30]  And it's got them in their cowboy hats.  Right.  And it says, Hill and Obama in shootout.  But I think we should make it perfectly clear that there's not really going to be gunplay.  I thought, see, I thought they had a shootout.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  And one of them might have been injured.  No, no, no.  Let's make it.  Oh, okay.  Good, good.  That's what comedy is.  Yeah.  It's completely literal.  Dummies.  John Shea and the station doesn't understand that.  I'm more pissed at those guys for like, you know, folding to these, these dopes out 
[00:29:00]  there in Mastic.  Yeah.  Go, hey, hey, take a joke.  John Shea should tuck it back and start singing.  I'm crying over you.  Would you?  Would you in Mastic?  Oh, boy.  We got Detroit calling, you know.  Detroit?  Oh, wow.  They're voting worst city every single year and they don't even give a crap.  They love it.  Yeah.  They celebrate by having a car bonfire.  Rolling over police cars.  Right.  That's how they celebrate.  We're number one again. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's roll a few cop cars.  And get some 40s.  That's where Winnie Mandela goes to learn how to properly execute political dissidents.  With gasoline attire around their neck.  Right.  And a match.  It's humor.  Lighten up, smothergill.  It's Opie and Anthony.  That's how we start today.  Chop, chop.  Go.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:30:00]  Morning.  Morning.  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  Is this Super Tuesday 2?  Part 2?  Part 2X.  Yeah.  They're saying Hillary needs a big win today.  A big win.  Or she's out of it.  She says it doesn't matter what happens.  She's going to forge ahead.  Yeah.  But it certainly looks like Barack Obama is being anointed as the Democratic nominee. 
[00:30:30]  And he will be running against John McCain.  Stephen S. from Bayshore getting back to the Mastic thing.  He writes, smothergill is what all the fish die of in the polluted waters of Mastic.  They got the smothergill.  And let's say hi to Billy on Long Island.  Billy, what's up?  Billy, I can't hear you. 
[00:31:00]  Go.  Start over.  Can you hear me now?  Yeah.  Okay.  I just want to make a comment.  I'm not originally from Long Island, but there's a show on News 12, the 12 channel on Long Island.  It's called Long Island's Most Wanted.  Nice.  They profile criminals, Nassau and Suffolk County.  I just wanted to make a comment that most of the people that they profile from Suffolk are from Mastic.  Really?  So they're the most wanted capital of Long Island? 
[00:31:30]  I would say that's a pretty good question.  We'll have to check those facts, sir.  Yeah.  We'll have to check those facts.  We'll check for ourselves.  You know what we have decided to do for Mastic.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, we're broadcasting pretty much all over the world at this point, and we're going to focus on Mastic for the rest of the week.  Yep.  It's going to be Get to Know Mastic on the Opie and Anthony show.  Why not?  We'll get to know Mastic with little fun facts.  Fun facts about Mastic.  About Mastic.  So you don't have to be from Long Island to help this bit.  If you could do a little Googling and searching on the Internet, I don't care if you're from Columbus, Ohio. 
[00:32:00]  No.  Oh, why should we?  Send in your Mastic Long Island facts, and we'll read them on the air.  Yeah.  We're looking for the good stuff, if you know what I mean.  And we're looking for real facts.  Right.  You know, things that may have happened in Mastic that kind of made the news.  Correct.  A mundo.  Things like that.  Let's go to Chris in North Carolina.  Chris, what's up?  This poor dumb DJ.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hold on, but he looks like Sinbad, just next to this whale of a greasy-haired woman. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, that woman.  After he was on the fat smash diet or something.  He's a little thinner than Sinbad.  Yeah, but he looks like a bit of an older gentleman.  He's wet.  Yeah.  He didn't need that.  He probably just, probably the safest show on radio.  Right.  And he just blurts something like that out, and he's there apologizing.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, I saved my job.  He's probably got, like, bills and stuff that he's barely able to pay.  And John said, you're going to apologize.  He got fired up, you know, taking his own life. 
[00:33:00]  I like this Randy, man.  This guy was forced to do it.  He held out a few days.  He's probably like, F you.  Yeah.  Die, and then he's like, you're not coming back.  And I held out a while so I could do some research on Mastic.  He looked around and realized no one had a job opening.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I got to stay here with this John Shea that doesn't stick up for his guys.  Yeah, that's not too uncomfortable in the hallway.  Yeah, no kidding.  When they pass each other.  I picture John Shea.  He doesn't support me.  I picture John Shea as a fat guy.  Iraq, maybe you can help me out on that.  I picture him as a wormy, skinny guy. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, a little worm with a height problem.  A wormy.  I couldn't make it as a DJ, so now I'm going to tell other people what to do on the radio.  Wonderful.  Chris, North Carolina, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  Listen every day.  Thank you.  Hey, just wanted to say that you guys have said worse in the last 45 minutes about this town.  Get the point.  That's the beauty of us.  We don't hold back.  I mean, someone has to fight these battles and show people how ridiculous it is. 
[00:34:00]  Jimmy was making a good point just before he came back from break about how we go into attack mode.  It's kind of what I was saying.  Yeah, I just kind of took it a step further.  It's what we are.  Like when I said Americans are really eunuchs, it's because we don't feel like we're in control of anything.  And it's like we have become this nation of just we like to just wait until somebody has a verbal flub.  And then we just we pile on.  And we look what he said.  Look what he said.  It's like we're like a bunch of hall monitor sissy. 
[00:34:30]  Look what happened to us.  Yeah.  It's embarrassing how much we love to jump on Michael Richards.  And he said something ridiculously stupid.  But it's just how we feel better about ourselves when we can get something done when somebody says something stupid.  It's just so silly.  It's that we can't accomplish anything real.  And that's it, too.  Says something silly.  Yeah.  Like it used to be you had to do something.  Yes.  Physically do something to get in the type of trouble that you get into now for just talking, for voicing a joke, parody, humor, whatever. 
[00:35:00]  There's supposed to be this freedom of speech we have in this country where you can do things like that.  Yeah, exactly.  They just don't get it anymore where you're able to do this.  And it's not the policy because it used to also be, well, it's policy of the radio station and FCC regulations say that you can't say blah, blah, blah.  This stuff is completely protected. 
[00:35:30]  You can make fun of things.  You shouldn't have your job threatened.  One thing about being a comic, it's like I've never been more grateful to be a stand up than now because it's like, yeah, you can't say, hey, just go on stage and you vomit on people.  And they get upset, too, but too bad.  They get up and leave.  Yeah.  D.L. Hughley, how great was it when they tried to protest him in Dallas because he repeated Imus' remark?  Yeah.  Or whatever he said about whatever.  And he just refused to apologize.  And you know what he's doing now?  He's hosting the NAACP Awards.  It didn't hurt D.L.  No.  Just got to hang in there. 
[00:36:00]  Of course.  Just hang in.  People move on to the next thing they think is a catastrophe.  Let's go to Tom and Shirley.  Tom, what's up?  Oh, yeah.  Remember about 15 years ago, Katie Beers, she was locked in that guy's basement?  Yeah.  That was Mastic?  No, she was from Mastic.  She was from Mastic.  I can't blame her.  I can't blame her.  Little Katie Beers.  Well, they were pointing out in the press conference that the first New York signee of the Declaration of Independence was William Floyd. 
[00:36:30]  And they have a high school named after this fine gentleman.  I just know that there's a high school named William Floyd, by the way.  Yeah.  That's how much I know about New York history.  So we have decided to do Get to Know Mastic for the rest of the week on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  So there you go.  There's the first one from Tom.  That's a wonderful story that happened back in the day.  Oh, was that fun?  She went to some little amusement center out on Long Island, kind of out around the Mastic area.  And she was abducted by a neighbor, somebody that was infatuated with her. 
[00:37:00]  He put her in some kind of underground dungeon, locked her in there.  They had a camera.  There was a TV that she would watch in this dungeon that was hooked up to cameras upstairs.  So she saw the police come in and question this guy.  And she had to sit there and watch the TV.  And the cops just leave.  John Esposito, I believe.  Was that his name?  Yeah.  It was under the garage. 
[00:37:30]  Yep.  Yeah.  He had this thing put away where you couldn't even tell it was a dungeon.  Yeah.  How did he obviously was obviously sexually abusing him for years, right?  He held her.  No, he held her for how long was it, Iraq?  Got the story.  I don't remember.  This goes way back now.  It was a while.  It wasn't years, but it was.  It was enough time to mess her up for the rest of her life.  Wasn't there a guy on Long Island who held somebody for years?  I know there's stories.  I'm sure there was.  Long Island has had a bevy of.  Well, there you go.  I wonder if Mark Smothergill is talking about the Katie Beers. 
[00:38:00]  Katie, little Katie Beers.  Let's get another fact about Mastic.  It's get to know Mastic for the rest of the week on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, Jim.  Hey, what's going on, Owen?  Hey.  This guy, Smothergill, sounds like a real bulldog.  But the thing is about Mastic, they actually have kids with whistles around their necks  because of all the kid touches out there.  So kids wear whistles around their neck.  And that's to let the.  I'm a cop with the NYPD. 
[00:38:30]  And Anthony, you actually work out with my dad.  He talks to you all the time.  Oh, hey, I know you.  Cool.  Great, man.  So I appreciate all the good times.  You guys, we work the midnights, sitting here with a bunch of guys in South Jamaica.  You guys really help us out.  Cool, man.  All right, right on.  You guys have a good day.  So according to Jim, the kids have to wear whistles around their neck.  And what happens is they blow the whistle, and that allows people to know where they  are.  To where the young child is.  In case the kid touchers can't find them.  It's their special game of Marco Polo.  I'm reading about Mastic. 
[00:39:00]  Somebody just sent me a link to some kind of message board.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And?  It says, first of all, most people are going to say that Mastic Beach is a wasteland.  I've been told by one of my friends that in a radio report, it was named the armpit of  Long Island.  Yeah.  What about that fact, Mark Smothergill?  You'll find yourself in situations where you ask someone where you live, answering about 
[00:39:30]  15 miles or 15 minutes from the Hamptons.  It's a safe way out.  I live 15 minutes from the Hamptons.  Wonderful.  There's a picture of this Mark Smothergill, I think, online.  If that was him.  What a rosy-cheeked ass.  If that's the guy.  He looks like Jim J. Bullock.  Oh, he really does look like a tool.  Is he taking a picture with his mommy?  Oh, rosy-cheeked.  Is that a picture with him and his mommy?  Might be his wife. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, really?  What?  He looks like a drunken Elo.  It looks like a...  Well, let's say Elo.  Or just Elo.  He looks like a ventriloquist dummy.  What a shiny-faced idiot.  And it looks like Mark Smothergill gets his hair frosted a little bit.  Just a little frosting on the top, please.  Here's a little more of the message board.  Someone called Mastic the armpit of Long Island.  Crotch or rectum is more like it.  Hey, we need an official, like, stinger for our get-to-know-Mastic bit that we're doing. 
[00:40:30]  Since 25 years ago, Mastic was the dumping ground for welfare.  Although many good people have moved in and lived there, the real estate values are depressed.  The local school district is sorting through a serious money mismanagement scandal.  Is that true?  How about that?  Largely due to mismanagement decades ago.  Traffic is very heavy.  Abysmal planning.  Local gas prices are well over $3 a gallon. 
[00:41:00]  And it just seems like a very depressed area.  Well, Travis just handed me just some of the stories about Mastic from January and February of this year.  So these stories are a mere month to two months old.  All right.  So we're not going back that far at all.  In the last month or two months, here are some of the headlines that have something to do with Mastic as we get to know Mastic on the O&A show.  Man breaks into Mastic home and stabs a lover's boyfriend to death.  Homeless man severely burned after another homeless man sets fire to a van he was sleeping in. 
[00:41:30]  Man arrested for trying to lure a 12-year-old girl into his vehicle.  Man arrested for walking around with python wrapped around his body.  And finally, girl sexually attacked on walk to Mastic school.  As we get to know Mastic.  That's from January and February alone.  There does seem to be a lot of this sexual assaults going on in Mastic.  What the hell's going on there?  Let's say hi to Matt from Baldwin, Long Island.  Matt? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  One time, last time I went to Mastic, I heard about this place.  We can get any reservation for cigarettes.  I went to the Indian reservation.  I buy the cigarettes.  As I'm going to my car, some guy runs out of the woods, grabs my car and the cigarettes,  and runs back into the woods.  Maybe they just ought to chop down all the trees around Mastic.  People come out of the woods.  Yeah.  They're coming out of the woods.  Ah!  Ah!  Cigarettes! 
[00:42:30]  Zombies need a smoke!  Right on my hands, man.  Unbelievable.  Oh, that's hysterical.  All right, sir.  One more before we take a break.  We got Freddie in Belmore.  A lot of Long Island calls today.  But the rest of the country can get into this whole Mastic thing.  Oh, I'm sure you know.  You got a town like this near you.  Freddie!  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good, man.  Hey, my sister-in-law lives out there.  She goes, yeah, it's the next Hamptons out there.  She calls it the next...  The next Hamptons?  The next Hamptons.  Yeah, when she was buying the house, she was like, yeah, it's going to be like the Hamptons. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, when the Hamptons finally have to expand, they're going to take over Mastic.  You guys are all going to be jumping.  There you go.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  We've got to take a break and catch up a little bit.  Yeah, 40,000 people might have been infected with HIV and hepatitis.  Really?  Yeah.  That's frightening.  In Mastic?  No, not in Mastic.  40,000 people when?  Overnight?  That's all I'm saying, Jimmy.  Oh, it's a big tease.  This is a tease.  I'm going to make... 
[00:43:30]  Oh, Jimmy's all teased.  I'm actually just going to sit here and look at you two during the commercials.  What?  What is it?  I'm going to make people wait 10 minutes to find out if they were infected with HIV or hepatitis.  Nice.  Because 40,000 people may have been.  Just say, women I've slept with.  Get it?  Give me those ribs, you.  And if you think you're safe, and if you think you're safe, uh-uh.  Oh.  You better just stick around and find out.  You're auditioning for the Channel 11 News here locally.  That's right, I am.  Get me out of this radio hellhole. 
[00:44:00]  Broadcast program.  Saturday Night Virus.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to bring the Saturday Night Virus the dose of entertainment you've been after.  You got it, because this Saturday night, the Than and Sam Show is back live at 9 p.m. Eastern.  After all of the explosive material last time, who knows what to expect this Saturday night on the Than and Sam Show.  Even I don't know.  And I'm the host.  Then I guess you'll just have to tune in Saturday night at 9 p.m.  It's the off-mispronounced Than and Sam Show on XM202. 
[00:44:30]  Saturday Night Virus.  How's everybody?  Doing all right?  All right.  The HIV thing was back.  I can't hear you, Jimmy.  Can't hear you, can't hear you.  Commercials are over.  What's with the HIV thing?  I sat at the commercial.  Oh, oh.  I watched you do the live reads.  You waited.  It was a blast.  I love the products.  What exactly is it?  With what?  No, seriously, what?  The HIV hep thing.  Oh.  It really got me.  Oh, it's got to be around here somewhere.  Yeah, we'll find it, Jimmy.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  Phone number 877-212-O&A. 
[00:45:00]  See, I understand this show well enough.  What I should have done was said, who cares about that?  Yeah.  It would have been the first thing we spoke about.  No, I don't even remember.  What was it?  I don't know.  Do you have HIV hep?  Oh, 40 people might have been infected.  40,000, you said.  40?  Oh, yeah, 40,000.  It's a big difference.  You don't just get to go, oh, okay, 40,000.  Yeah, something like 40 or 40,000.  No, I think it is 40,000.  Perhaps more than that.  And they don't even know they might have been infected by it.  So, the story's around here somewhere. 
[00:45:30]  They'll know eventually.  Might have hep.  I'm in this robe drinking broth.  Might have HIV.  Might have liver fallout.  Could you find the story for Jimmy?  I don't know what happened to it.  We got more important things to do right now.  And now it's time for a Mastic moment.  As Opie and Anthony take a glorious look at this majestic Long Island community.  Let's say hi to Frank, formerly from Mastic. 
[00:46:00]  Frank, what do you have today?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, Frank.  What?  I think Frank is trying to say that a school board guy allegedly took $7 million.  Yeah, there was some misappropriations of some money.  I can't hear you, bro. 
[00:46:30]  Your phone stinks.  Your phone sucks.  Tell Tim we need an outro now.  And that was another Mastic moment from the Opie and Anthony show.  Every intro needs a good outro.  That's right.  Come on.  All right.  A clinic may have infected 40,000 with HIV and hepatitis.  40,000.  40,000 people.  How do they do that by accident?  In the fine city of?  Of?  Ah.  We broadcast to a lot of cities. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, no.  Let me think.  And we broadcast to this city.  We do?  More after the next break.  Wait a minute.  That's the double T's.  We're actually on.  In the city.  In this particular city.  Is it Boston?  Hmm.  Is it Cleveland?  Hmm.  Is it Buffalo?  Hmm.  Hmm.  I would say.  It's not San Francisco.  It's got to be somewhere.  With.  They eat HIV for breakfast in San Francisco. 
[00:47:30]  Wow.  They laugh at it.  It's old hats.  Right.  They take their multivitamin and a nice dose of HIV every morning.  Do you?  There was a group of gay men.  Did we talk about this years ago?  Who was.  There was a fetish in the gay community.  Or was it a rumor?  Yeah.  Where the guys were going out and just having sex unprotected.  And trying to get HIV.  Why would anyone do that?  I'm not making that up.  It's something I heard. 
[00:48:00]  It was just weird.  I don't know if it's because of the sympathy you get from the community when you have it.  Or if it was a rumor.  But it was actually talked about.  Or is it they didn't want to get it really.  But just the.  No, no, no.  The thrill of that you might get it.  I don't know.  Like a Russian roulette kind of thing, you know.  They want to feel pregnant.  Yes.  Is that.  Like you're carrying something.  I read an article once.  And some gay guys like the.  I don't know.  It's some weird pregnancy thing. 
[00:48:30]  Really?  Like they feel like they're pregnant.  Ooh.  Or something like that.  They have what they have.  Yeah, yeah.  It's odd.  Like they now have something that's kind of growing inside of them.  Well.  I just made that whole thing up.  How cool is that?  Oh, okay.  I'm an idiot.  I was thinking, wow.  Beat that, Mark Smothergill.  Smothergill.  That was called some weird improv.  The Smothergills.  Hey, can we play the AIDS commercial, please, there, E-Rock?  You know, if we're talking about AIDS.  Hey, and we'll tell you what fine city this happened in. 
[00:49:00]  After the next break, there's your next hint.  I don't know.  But we are broadcasting to this city.  And not on XM, by the way, on a regular radio station.  Right.  Let's listen to this real fast.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go any place.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6.  AIDS helps control your appetite so you lose weight.  Yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant.  AIDS helped me lose the weight. 
[00:49:30]  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous.  Question, why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  I like that.  Question.  He has to say, question.  Yeah.  Why use?  I know it's a question.  You go up at the end, dummy.  Well, maybe that's their way of saying that, like, we're not asking you necessarily as the audience.  Like, if he might just say, why use?  And then the dumb audience goes, we don't know.  We don't understand the product, idiot. 
[00:50:00]  So, he's like, question.  Question.  Almost like I'm taking the place of you, the audience.  Question.  Right.  Question.  Sure.  That's a good point, Ant.  Why wouldn't you say no?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  You know, it's time.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  As Opie and Anthony take a glorious look at this majestic Long Island community.  Let's say hi to John from Mastic.  From Mastic.  Very good.  Getting to know Mastic.  Celebrating Mastic, if you will.  For the rest of the week.  Yes, John. 
[00:50:30]  John?  Yeah, hello.  Yeah, I think they got a weird cell thing that happens in Mastic.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The X-Files.  Why put a tower in a poor town?  They're using the same phone that Michael Douglas used in Wall Street on a beach.  It's a stupid shoebox with an antenna on it.  A giant brick.  Yeah, John, go ahead.  Yeah, when I was younger.  I used to go to school in Mastic.  And all the brothers used to steal the mail neighborhood and hide it in an abandoned house. 
[00:51:00]  And then, like, once a month, the cops would come and try to get them.  And it would look like the house was on fire.  And they'd all go running down the blocks for the Indian Reservation.  Because when they got to the Indian Reservation, the cops weren't allowed to cross the line.  And then the cops would have to camp out outside the Indian Reservation and wait for these guys to come back.  I love this.  I can't get enough of this town.  I'm falling in love with Mastic.  You're running everywhere.  All I know is when I was, like, driving around in Long Island, we would just avoid this area. 
[00:51:30]  Nah, I got to hang out in this area.  Now we got to go and party there.  He would have to just camp out and wait.  John, wonderful.  What is it, 1850?  That's a great story.  See, we're getting to that.  Not allowed in here, revenue-er.  I didn't like them apples, Mark Smothergill.  Let's say hi to Bill in South Carolina.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, that thing that Jimmy was talking about, Hannity did a story on it.  And they called the guys that had the AIDS gift-givers. 
[00:52:00]  And XMU's got in one of their promos for Hannity that he was talking about that for a while.  Gift-givers?  Yeah, the guys that had the AIDS were called gift-givers.  And the guys that wanted it would go seek them out to get them to give it to them.  But what is it?  Why would you want AIDS?  But you know what?  You might not be so crazy with that impreg-  Hold on, bro.  Hold on.  I'm sorry about to interrupt you.  You might not be that crazy with that pregnancy thing.  It really might be like being filled with-  I don't know, but there's got to be some weird psychological thing.  I did hear that. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Like you're having hardcore sex with another man.  And you're like, get me pregnant.  Give me your seed.  You think there's some kind of a thing that you want?  I don't know.  You want to carry something?  Well, everyone knows what this is.  Let's go to Brad in Atlanta.  Brad?  Brad.  Good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Brad.  Pretty much, yeah.  What it was, the people that wanted the bug or AIDS or whatever the disease was, was a bug  catcher.  And whoever would give it is a gift giver. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, my God.  And they would even have these elaborate bug parties where you'd get together and swap.  Anyway, punch it out.  How great.  That could be the greatest thing I've ever heard.  Interesting.  I'm a bug catcher.  Oh, bug catcher.  Why would you want that?  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  Now, it's time.  Oh, sorry.  Mastic moment.  As Opie and Anthony take a glorious look at this majestic Long Island community.  Let's say hi to Rob from Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  What is wrong with the cell phone? 
[00:53:30]  Every time we try to take a call, it just...  See, even God hates you.  Apparently, the library carries video games.  Because what?  Because the kids can't read on a...  I don't know how.  You know, we're trying to stick to the facts here.  Yes.  Oh.  It's probably saying there's two portals for them.  Oh.  Sorry, Jimmy.  I'm interrupting you, but...  This is depressing. 
[00:54:00]  As Opie and Anthony take a glorious look at this majestic Long Island community.  All right, let's try another one.  It's Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  Good morning, ladies.  Your music is loud.  Oh, is that it?  No, what's up, Chris?  Yeah, that's all right.  Here we go.  I don't know if you remember.  A couple years back, the cop that pulled a girl over from the bar in Nastic and made her walk  home naked while he followed her.  Oh, I remember that story.  That was Mastic?  That's Mastic.  That's Mastic.  Yeah, a cop pulled over a girl.  She was drunk. 
[00:54:30]  And to teach her a little lesson, he made her take her clothes off and walk home as he  followed her slowly behind her.  I remember that one.  Oh, that's fantastic.  All right, getting back to this.  Oh, no.  And now it's time for a Mastic moment.  So much here.  As Opie and Anthony take a glorious look at this majestic Long Island community.  Let's say hi to Dave on Long Island.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, two things, if it's okay. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, I hear some guy invented some sticky tape called Mastic Tape.  Oh, we know it as masking tape.  But I guess it started out as Mastic Tape?  Yeah, I think so.  Because of all the sexual predators that live in the area?  Oh, that's good.  Then they could, now it's duct tape.  Right.  Or they could just bind their ankles and wrists.  And one more thing.  Did you really want to try another one?  What?  Yeah.  We'll try one more.  Okay. 
[00:55:30]  We'll leave you with the sounds of Mastic.  All right.  Toilet flushing, always funny.  Wow, he bailed himself out of that spiral.  That is a huge comeback right there.  First two pitchers, you miss the ball by a mile, where your whole body spins around, and  then the third pitch, you hit it out of the ballpark.  Dude, that's, by the way, the outro.  Yeah.  We'll leave you with the sounds of Mastic and a toilet flushing. 
[00:56:00]  The toilet.  Or a different sound every day.  Yeah.  If Steve's working for the show today, can you run down the hall and tell Tim that that's  the outro we want?  You can stop updating for one minute.  Just please don't tell him.  We've got to address that issue.  All right.  So there you go.  And we did the HIV thing.  So it's a clinic.  Oh, we didn't really do the story, did we?  The clinic thing?  Oh, no.  Oops.  No, we've got to know what.  Oh, a clinic.  Oh, I almost slipped.  It's a clinic.  40,000 people infected with, perhaps infected with HIV and hep. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  We're going to tell you after the break.  It's in a city that we broadcast to.  Yeah, that's all I'm going to tell you right now.  And now I know in a clinic.  They unknowingly might have got the HIV or the hepatitis.  40,000 people.  40,000 people.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex put you here.  It isn't clear. 
[00:57:00]  But what we're certain of is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV.  You've got full-blown AIDS.  Not HIV, but really full-blown AIDS.  I'm sorry.  I wish it was something less serious.  What is AIDS? 
[00:57:30]  You've got the AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  All right.  Before...  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Marine throws puppy off cliff?  Yeah, this is...  Yeah, we got that story.  Yeah.  It looks like it might be fake.  Okay.  Like, there's a big controversy here.  No one wants it to be real.  Shocking video. 
[00:58:00]  Are they showing it?  Why wouldn't they?  They're not going to show the animal splatting.  I mean, they showed dead Marines.  Yeah, but people have a...  Here's the story.  Soft spot for puppies.  Here's the story to get everyone up to date.  Cute little puppy.  Oh, so cute.  So cute little puppy.  Oh, oh, oh, a trip.  That's mean.  That was mean, Matari.  What did I do?  That's the actual video of the throwing of the puppy.  So the video shows a Marine holding a puppy by the scruff of its neck. 
[00:58:30]  And then he...  You hear what they just said.  And then he takes it and just wails it.  And it goes head over heels.  And it makes that...  Sound.  And then, bam, he threw it off a cliff.  Is what he did.  If you want to watch the video, it's right there, Jimmy.  But a lot of controversy here.  Saying that the sound was edited in.  It's actually an already dead puppy.  And, uh...  Yeah, he threw a... 
[00:59:00]  You know, the puppy was dead.  Oh, okay.  And then he threw it.  A lot of controversy there.  What's the matter?  You rock?  Can't get that YouTube working?  It's been removed.  It's been removed?  The video's been removed?  Yeah.  Violation.  Of what?  Violation of animal cruelty.  How about go to somewhere?  But Lonely Girl 15 gets to continue doing her crap.  Go to Dog Pile.  That's one thing about Google that stinks.  Go to dogpile.com.  YouTube has Lonely Girl 15.  Nothing on there?  No?  What? 
[00:59:30]  Lonely Girl 15.  All right.  15.  That hit TV show.  Remember the Britney guy?  He's getting a show.  That guy was kind of crazy.  Well, whatever.  We don't have the video.  But there's controversy.  They're not really sure.  They're investigating, trying to find out if it's real.  Of course, I like to think it's fake and staged because that is, you know, that's a little  much.  It's just needless barbarism.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  Even for a Marine who are completely on your side.  But to just throw a puppy off a cliff, it's kind of hard to explain that away.  You know, maybe we need people like that over there, but we just don't want to see that  kind of stuff.  Like, there you go.  See?  Oh, the puppy.  First of all, it's real.  It's a real puppy, but it might be dead already.  It's not moving at all when he's holding it by the scruff.  Where was this?  In Iran?  It looks a little stiff.  It's not moving at all.  Yeah.  I mean, is this in Iraq?  Iraq, yeah.  Or Afghanistan.  It's not moving.  Yeah, but if you hold a cat like that, I know that much. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, a cat.  Not a puppy, though.  I don't know.  If you hold a cat by the back of the neck, the cat will not move.  He's definitely throwing.  See?  Look, it looks a little stiff.  I don't know.  The other guy's posing next to it.  It's a goof for their dumb friends.  It's probably a dead dog they found.  Yeah, they found a dead dog.  Yeah, I think you're right, because the dog, it was thrown pretty far, but it wouldn't  have died on impact.  That dog would have moved after the fact. 
[01:01:00]  And then they put in, in post, they put in the sound effect of a dog going, yap, yap,  yap.  See, when the dog hits, I mean, the guy throws it, what, 20 yards maybe?  Yeah.  And not even down that much of a cliff, maybe down, he's up maybe, what, 10 feet?  That's not a big cliff.  No, I mean, at the very least, the dog would have, like, moved around after it hit the  ground.  You know, it's pretty sick even throwing a dead puppy like that.  Oh, it is.  He's a Marine. 
[01:01:30]  It absolutely is twisted, but that dog looks very dead.  The private dog's name is Scrappy-Doo, sir.  Why is Private Pyle petting a dead animal?  Or dead animals allowed in the barracks?  Because they smell, sir.  Because they smell.  That is a little twisted, but I say fake.  Yeah, I think you're right.  And now it's time for a Mastic Moment. 
[01:02:00]  As Opie and Anthony take a glorious look at this majestic Long Island community.  Let's say hi to Pete in Sayerville.  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  I've got a great Mastic story for you out there.  Yeah.  All right.  Two years ago, my brother-in-law is taking his garbage out in Mastic.  Right on the corner of the street, we've got these two parties going on that pile out  into the street.  Crackhead kills one of these guys with a bow and arrow from his porch.  Ooh. 
[01:02:30]  You got killed by a bow and arrow in Mastic?  Yeah, hunting bow.  Hunting bow.  Yeah, right in Mastic.  That's just wonderful.  Thank you, Sam.  Fantastic.  Yeah, let's go to Bob on Long Island.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I've got a buddy that lives in Mastic, and we're hanging out in his garage one night  working on dirt bikes.  And I asked him where I should throw the empty beer bottles.  He's like, I just throw them out onto the lawn, try to get them close to the mailbox.  I'm like, why would you do that?  And he said that the land clammers come around at night and collect them. 
[01:03:00]  They'll be gone by the morning.  Land clammers?  Those are people that collect empties?  Empty bottles are called land clammers.  We're learning so much about Mastic.  Thank you, Bob.  And that was a bird's eye view into the scenic town we hold close to our hearts.  A Mastic moment on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right.  We should be honored by Mastic.  We should get, like, a key to the city.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Tim and PA. 
[01:03:30]  Tim, what's up?  It's a key, but it comes, like, with a big metal thing, like when you go to a gas station,  you have to use the toilet so you don't run off of it.  So you don't steal it.  How about it's got a carburetor on it?  Oh, yeah.  Hubcap.  How about the key's just in the shape of a toilet brush?  Sure.  A metal toilet brush.  They give you the toilet brush to the city.  Tim, what's up?  Listen, I hate to break up the festivities, but could you please tell us the name of the city  where the HIV and hepatitis was given out to 40,000 people, please?  Thank you.  Yeah, we'll absolutely do that right after these messages.

[01:48:00]  of him  I don't mean  that he  promoted my  show  I mean  that he  created a  situation  where  because this  lying ass  will now  take that  audio  and make  something  he's the  laughing stock  of Cleveland  obviously  but now  the country  he's trying  the angle  of love  you want  to play  us nationally  we could  use the  publicity  you stink  you're horrible  you're not  a funny guy  I think he's  kind of funny  got some comedy 
[01:48:30]  chats  if he was  any good  we wouldn't  play him  we don't want  to expose  good people  to the country  here look  at this  this guy's  much better  employee  than I am  check him  out boss  you don't  do that  speaking of  not funny  we should  get their  opinion  on the  whole  Mastic  thing  we had  another  DJ  that had  to  apologize  at a  press  conference  he had  to do  a book  report  about this  town  Mastic  they made  him do  pretty much  the equivalent  of a book  report  for Mastic  you actually 
[01:49:00]  do a bit  about something  like that  what is it  about  Radio Jack  got on the  air  and took  a call  from Mastic  out here  on Long  Island  there's a town  that is just  it's kind of  you know  below the  level of  income  that places  should be  but he called  the white  trash  yeah  he actually  said  here's the  whole thing  a woman  called up  and said  he told her  do your pipes  freeze in the  winter  underneath your 
[01:49:30]  trailer  she said  I don't live  in a trailer  and that was it  that was the  whole line  that was it  are you kidding  me  so he had  to apologize  so he got  suspended  for saying  for saying  to your  pipe  for implying  that people  in Mastic  live in  trailers  and do you  know this  Mastic  is not  zoned  for trailers  we love that  then he should  have been  suspended  because that's  a false  statement  of course  misinformation  there  I've been  to Mastic  plenty of  times  it's what  I would  describe  and what  people describe  as white 
[01:50:00]  trash  is that  Shirley  yes  yeah  because  Quinn's  always joking  about Shirley  that's where  his cousin  lives  Tim Gage  yes  so he said  it's the worst  everyone from  Mastic and Shirley  tries to pick  another place  close by  that they're from  they say no  I'm from like  Medford or something  is this like  where the area  where like  this is in  Long Island  yeah it's pretty  much when you  run out of  expressway  so it's like  where Queens  starts to turn  into Long Island  oh my god  no it's so much  further than that  it's closer to 
[01:50:30]  England than  Queens  it's close to  the Hampton  it's close to  the Hampton  here's a news  story  it's 30 seconds  Randy Spears  co-host of  Long Island's  WBLI morning  show came  under fire  last week  after making  trailer park  jokes  about people  living in  Mastic  he was pulled  off the air  last Thursday  at first  Spears  refused to  apologize  but  yesterday  met with  residents  face to  face  and when  and when I  made those  statements  I was just  trying to  have fun  with the  listeners  like I  usually do  it was not 
[01:51:00]  my intention  to hurt  an entire  community  Randy Spears  says he spent  the weekend  driving around  and found out  that there are  no trailer  parks in Mastic  so what  took his car  in a carjacking  and sexually  assaulted him  because many  predators  seem to live  there  but he did  find out  there are  no trailer  parks  he sounds  like a woman  become a man  I was going  to say  why does he  sound like  an 80 year  old woman  who's had  a sex change  and become  a man  well if you  look at the  pictures on 
[01:51:30]  the website  hello  sounds like  I'm  blown away  by that  because I  thought you  were going  to say  that he  said white  trash  and that  somebody  decided  he just  made a  trailer joke  and they  wanted him  fired  and the radio  station said  if he didn't  apologize  they would have  fired him  for that  and the poor  guys got  bills  and he had  to take  back  something  that he  had a  right to  say  in the  post  and it's  only going  to get  worse  if Barack  Hillary  is  president  in the 
[01:52:00]  post  it said  he said  white  trash  since when  do you get  in trouble  for picking  on white  people  he's implying  that they  are white  trash  maybe he  didn't say  it beforehand  I don't know  I didn't hear  it either  it wasn't  in the quote  even if he  did who  cares  who cares  you never  get in  trouble for  saying white  trash  any other  derogatory  race  then you're  in big  trouble  you're allowed  to say  even if he 
[01:52:30]  said people  from Mastiff  people from  Mastic  are all  awful  and their  lives are  wretched  and even  though I've  never been  in a home  I'm confident  in saying  that none  of their  lives are  good  I'll say  that right  now  that's on the  sign when  you drive  into the  town  right under  the population  picture of  Tim  welcome to  Mastiff  Mastic

[02:07:30]  that was a heart's review  into the scenic town  we hold close to our hearts  a mastic moment  on the Opie and Anthony show  a 6 year old kid  smoking out of the hole  in his throat  he's already  throat removed  he's already pushing around  in an oxygen tank  and it's because he smokes  it's not because  it's some chemical  he's been trying to quit  since he was 3  he's got a patch  that rattle in your chest  or your hand  no if you  if you did an ordinance 
[02:08:00]  where you did make people  put their toilets  on the front lawn  that would be an improvement  that would be a beautification  they'd call you  fancy schmancy  they'd be like  what are we putting on airs  yeah these city boys  instead of having  the Virgin Mary  in the you know  half shell  we got a real estate agent  on the line  Miles from Minnesota  what's up Miles  yeah hey  I just wanted to  let you guys know  do you realize  that the closing cost  on those houses  is three times more  than the actual house  yeah  exactly  the closing cost 
[02:08:30]  is where they get you  I don't search  on these things man  oh that's right  the lawyer  that you'd have to hire  and all that stuff  yeah  just the pen  the pen that you use  to sign  more than the house  more than the house  I want to buy a house  though there  I just want to have one  what's up with those houses  that cost less than $2,000  something  I don't get it  yeah  what's up is that  the place is horrible  they're built on a pile  of AIDS needles  and you're only allowed  to be barefoot  in that part of town  yeah there's any ordinance  yeah there's another ordinance

[02:12:30]  you gotta know  how to take a joke  I don't  no  I don't worry  about the joke  I said  I don't care  about the context  how he said things  what I didn't like  is the fact  he had enough balls  not to apologize  on the air  in the first place  right  then he came out  and had this  great written  apology  that everybody  made a big deal  about how  it's  his apology  and how he came out  and he toured  all these different places  and toured the  William Floyd estate  it's closed 
[02:13:00]  till springtime  I've lived here  for 25 years  if he was at the gate  and he toured it  and he's telling us  how wonderful it is  it looks like crap  outside the gate  so you just think  he's being disingenuous  I think he's full of crap  yeah  so you're not insulted  by his making fun of Mastic  you think he's being phony now  is that the thing  I'm not thrilled about him  picking on Mastic  because I mean  why  we're an easy pick  but  so  so that makes it more fun 
[02:13:30]  wait Mark  let me explain  what happens  in these situations  the station made him apologize  he wasn't going to apologize  absolutely  but they basically said  you're going to be fired  unless you read this statement  that our lawyers put together  right  and I told them  when I spoke to the news  I told them  I didn't care that he was fired  I didn't care about any of that  what I cared about  or even suspended  I didn't want him suspended  I don't know the context of his show  don't listen to it  I told them at the time  I listened to your show  we had other people that complained 
[02:14:00]  while Opie and Anthony  jumped on the bandwagon  which I knew you would  because  you're not into people  getting suspended  or fired for things  because it's something  that's near and dear  to your heart  but Mark  at least we're doing  our research  in how horrible  Mastic is  yeah  I mean here's the thing  people in your town  put pressure on  this guy had to go back  on something he said  because he's got a job  and he has the bills to pay  and they couldn't take  a really light joke  about their town 
[02:14:30]  which is  if you knew anything  about the area  who cares  who cares about the area  yeah Mark  it doesn't matter  it's just a joke  people can make a joke  that Mastic  is just a pile of poop  and not know anything about it  and then the people in Mastic  should hear it  and go  oh well  I'm going to go live my life now  that's the thing about this area  it's been so fractured for years  so what  it's just words  it's just a radio DJ  making fun  of a stupid town  where you can buy a home  for $1,600  so who cares 
[02:15:00]  that's not true  and you know  it's not  yes it is  no we're looking  and apparently  you can buy a house  for $1,600 there  so we found it online  you can't buy a house  we're a little confused  but we're online  and there are houses  for sale in Mastic  for $1,600  I don't understand  how this is possible  but I want like a dozen  I want to buy  a bunch of these houses  a six pack of houses  my wife sells real estate  on the side  trust me  even if it's not true 
[02:15:30]  we're going to buy  one of these houses  and we're going to force  all the town people  to take their dumps  in the house  that's what we just said  we're going to have everybody  we want an ordinance  where toilets go  on the front lawn  not even  no you just walk  in the house  and just  do what you have to do  the whole house is a toilet  the bottom line  our goal is to try  to fill it up  to the ceiling  it could be worse  it could be the dumpy area  you used to live in  Boston  that I hear you talking about  oh Ashland  so that's okay  that's the whole point  who cares even if it's true  people make fun of a town 
[02:16:00]  and that town goes  and shuts up  I mean who cares  it's just a town full of babies  that should just die in a pile  you know why  it's good that people  stood up and said something  why is that  it's not good  because we've been  beaten down to long  oh big deal  poor babies  grow up  grow some thick skin  move out of mastic  you're the prop of the country  congratulations with  but Mark  because you guys  stood up for your town  we just made it a lot worse  the last couple of days  yeah  just drink Drano

[02:19:00]  go screw  Radio Bad Boys  Opie and Anthony  controversial radio personalities  Opie and Anthony  infamous DJs  Opie and Anthony  talk show radio host  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Radio Shock Jocks  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  there was some dude  who liked horses  and liked the radio show  and named his horses  after us. And then let them starve.  Let them starve. Great. I don't like what we're  doing for the listeners. Starving them of 
[02:19:30]  entertainment. I've got sick free.  Bobby, please look. There's one part  we want you to see. That's easy.  Are you okay?  Where entertainment is going? These guys are  watching porn. Oh, Jesus.  What are we talking about?  We're done.  What the fuck?  It's time for people to understand  these are words. If you don't  like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:20:00]  Wow, that would be really cool.  Here we are at XM Satellite Radio. We're just  getting word that I think we're getting  Bubz and Omar from The Wire  for tomorrow's show.  I mean, there are no Nick DiPaolo or  Louis C.K., but still, it's a big get  for our show. We're very happy.  Extremely happy. Yes.  Reminds me of good times.  You've ever seen The Wire?  I'm going to do what Jimmy did. You didn't really watch The Sopranos  really big, but then you bought the whole thing, right?  I finally caught up in season two.  That's what I figured I'm going to do.  I never really saw it.  I'm going to bang it out. Ignore my wife for a month. 
[02:20:30]  I'm banging it out right now.  I'm four episodes into the second season.  Oh, you're already in season two?  Yeah, I'm moving fast now.  I'm doing two to three episodes a day.  That guy that plays Omar, though, he's in  that bad movie I wrote with Chris Rock.  He's good in it.  Which movie?  Is he?  I think I love my wife.  He was in that?  Yeah, he plays this ex-boyfriend of the guy that his chick is dating.  He was also on...  He's really mean and nasty.  He's great.  Fochote!  Well, I'm mean and nasty.  I could have got the call on that one. 
[02:21:00]  Fochote!  Feel me?  Michael K. Williams and Andre Royale.  I don't trust it, because we're supposed to get another guy from season four  who's become a big star in season four and five.  If Roland fucked that up and got my hopes up for Michael K. Williams,  I'm going to bite Roland's fucking car.  Who's Roland should know about it, too, not to get your hopes up.  No, it's Omar.  Yeah, Michael K. Williams is Omar.  No, I'm going to just call him Omar.  This is 80% sure, Jimmy.  I'm calling him Omar the whole time.  We should only talk about his role in Gone Baby Gone.  He was in a very small part. 
[02:21:30]  He was a cop in Gone Baby Gone.  Yeah.  We should only talk about that.  He was the good cop, and his brother in Gone Baby Gone was the Omar character.  That was awful.  Hey, it stunk it.  I liked Gone Baby Gone.  It wasn't that bad.  There's worse movies.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it wasn't.  That should be the quote in the other.  There's worse movies.  There's worse movies.  Anthony Camina.  And the star of Gone Baby Gone is in season two of The Wire.  Whatever the fuck it is.  It makes a big difference.  Dago name.  It's just another WAP name. 
[02:22:00]  Anthony Italian.  I saw a great movie last week.  What movie?  That's what they should have done.  Sorry, we're having two conversations.  This show just doesn't listen.  It's all right.  I apologize.  The listeners will pick what conversation they want to go with.  Yeah, do it in stereo and just split it.  We're the worst at listening to each other.  It's amazing.  What do you want to do?  What were you guys doing?  I don't remember now.  I was making fun of his name being Italian.  Oh, okay.  If you want to see a great movie.  You're Italian?  Practical Magic with Sandra Bullock.  Practical Magic with Sandra Bullock. 
[02:22:30]  Jesus.  He's really good.  I put that right above Midnight Cowboy.  Right below Cuckoo's Neck.  Anything with that Sandra Bullock.  She's good, though.  I mean, you know, yeah.  What was the Dennis Leroy of 2FIC?  Yeah.  That was so terrific.  Boy, can she pick them.  I like the lake house myself.  Oh, God.  That is the worst thing I ever saw.  Was that horrid?  Just, they don't even, it's based on a really hard to sell premise and they don't even try.  What's it about?  It's a lake house.  It's about mastic.  A two bedroom in mastic. 
[02:23:00]  It was bought for $1,200 and it was a piece of shit.  And the mailbox.  Yeah.  She owns it in like now times.  It's so bad.  And what's his name?  Keanu owned it.  Like a few years before.  It's not even like a man from the 40s who owned it.  Hello, what is this?  It's like a few years before.  I hope it's not from a Negro.  Yeah.  But, and they'd send letters to each other in the mailbox of this place.  And then they figured out like they were in different times.  Like she would put a letter in the mailbox. 
[02:23:30]  That happened to me once.  Did it?  Wait, she would put her mail in the mailbox.  It's email.  She put her.  This sounds good.  She put a letter in the mailbox, which who does that anyway?  Yeah.  I don't.  And then it was just gone.  She put the flag up or some shit.  What it was is that.  Oh, you're kidding me.  What it was is that he.  That was the big dramatic part.  Oh, you're fucking kidding me.  He wrote a letter saying whoever.  I don't even.  I can't even do it.  She lived there.  And she's like, no, I'm living here.  So they kind of figured out that they lived in a different time in the same house and 
[02:24:00]  kind of fell in love over this.  Yeah, that always happens.  Yeah, of course.  By mail.  He should have just dropped the load in the mailbox.  But she opens it up with a big shit.  And just gets a fucking load of cum in her hand.  Here's your delivery.  There's your timeless love, you cunt.  There you go.  Or a mousetrap.  A mousetrap with fucking AIDS blood on it.  Here you go, slut.  Here's your time-traveling splooge.  So they kind of made this deal.  He said something to the woman playing her.  Yeah, you did a great job in speed too, you fucking hole. 
[02:24:30]  They kind of made this deal for him to meet her.  Yeah.  And he winds up getting hit by a car and dying or some shit.  No, but the thing is where they destroy the premise, which is bad anyway, is that they  wanted to start having to be able to have conversations that are like two or, you know, instead of  long letters.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just bad dialogue.  So they want to be able to go, so how are you doing?  I'm fine.  How are you?  So they just stand there and each put one in, like, right, I'm okay.  How are you?  Put the letter in.  And then the other person gets it and says, oh, that's nice here.  And then they start talking really fast back and forth. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  And the flag magically goes up and down.  Yeah.  And one of them dies with a paper cut.  Oh, I see they fucking, they're in different times in the same house, just writing letters  to each other.  And the mailbox has this magical ability to transport the letters.  I was just putting a fucking one walkie-talkie.  Put one walkie-talkie in the fucking mailbox and stand at it with another one.  Yeah.  And you can talk to each other or some shit.  Exactly.  Try things.  That's a horribly tedious fucking plot.  It sucked dick, this movie.  How about send a photo of your 20th century pussy?  Yeah.  I've never heard of a camera yet. 
[02:25:30]  Send a photo of your cunt in a racing form.  Stop wasting my time.  Take me off the fucking stock sheets.  Let me know what stock I should buy, you dumb cunt.  Send me a picture of your mouth around the genitals of a Negro.  Oh my God.  This show is unbelievable.  It's just gotten horrific.  How does the dumb movie end?  He gets hit by a bus.  Or she stops him from getting hit by a bus.  That's how it starts.  It starts with somebody getting killed in the road and Sandra Bullock is with her mother, 
[02:26:00]  I think, and looking out and going, oh, that's kind of a horrible thing.  You don't realize at the time that that's him.  And then at the end of the movie, it turns out through everything that had happened,  he was coming to meet her.  And then because of that, she saved him from killing him.  So you don't realize until 20 minutes in that it's him.  And he's killed by a bus.  Is he really killed by a bus?  Yeah.  Which is ironic.  Yeah, exactly.  Don't you think?  Fucking speed.  Speed.  That is just...  I forgot about that.  They were in that together, huh?  All of them.  You can't make a fucking movie without a bus in it, that dumb whore. 
[02:26:30]  We want to do a stage wagon.  It's in a rider.  Yeah, it's in a rider.  There has to be somebody that dies by bus in my movie.  I want to give props to Drudge.  Holy shit, go to Drudge.  It has...  I saw this this morning.  It has a picture of Hillary, and underneath it, it says C-Day.  I know.  Oh, nice.  It says C-Day.  What is this guy?  What's that supposed to mean?  That's funny.  Yeah, exactly.  They just said it to you on the way over here.  Yeah, they are doing that on purpose.  It's a big day for Hillary.  It says C-Day. 
[02:27:00]  But why do they call it...  What's the straight line?  She's a cunt.  That is a straight line.  Is there any other way to look at it?  That is a straight line.  No, but so there isn't...  There isn't, like, some...  This is a single entendre calling her a cunt.  I just said to him on the way over here.  We should have a new...  He was talking about...  We should do a newspaper, yeah.  To do a newspaper like The Post, but that just goes further.  Just wave.  We should have her there on the cover and just write...  Just write C?  That's what I...  C, and that's what he was saying.  C in quotes, and then you turn the page and it says,  By C, we mean cunt.  That's so weird that you just... 
[02:27:30]  That's fucking bizarre, man.  That paper would sell.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, we should have sold it on the air  because we probably threw away a million dollars just now.  God damn it!  There's some millionaire listening.  You'll be going down the street tomorrow?  It's going to be...  By the time we can leave here, it's going to be...  X-Rex!  The guy hands it to you with a little guy.  X-Tree, X-Tree.  We would get...  We'd get old-fashioned paper boys with knickers.  Oh, oh, the short pants.  The C loses the Texas A.  We're on the show today.  No, we're not going to hire them.  X-Tree, X-Tree. 
[02:28:00]  X-Tree, X-Tree.  Hillary Clinton's a cunt.  Would you like a paper, sir?  That would be a wonderful newspaper.  It would be amazing.  The Daily Shittin' Mouth.  Yes, exactly.  Oh, God.  Here's a good picture of her.  Oh, they are really fucking mean.  They love fucking with her with pictures.  He looks so awesome.  Look at him.  He's got sunglasses on like he's fucking...  He looks like Malcolm X.  Will Smith, Malcolm X.  Look at that turkey neck on that pig.  And she's...  Look at that.  She's pulling her chin in. 
[02:28:30]  She's about to blow chunks onto my balls, I hope.  She had like 12 pounds of Chinese food in a six-pack before she went to bed.  Look at those horrible chin.  That's like Kevin Meany.  That's just because you just lean back.  We've all done the lean back in a picture and look horrible.  Yeah, big old actions.  Hey, I don't want the chocolate.  Every time somebody takes a picture, I'm like this.  Oh, yeah, I stick my chin out.  I'm like a fucking ski jumper.  Let's get E-Rock in here, because talking about Obama,  supposedly Limbaugh said something pretty outrageous. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He just laughed at something.  We're just getting this line...  He laughed at something somebody else said.  This is how we get the line on the air without getting fired, by the way.  Wow, look at the young Hillary.  Wow.  Geez.  Hello.  She hasn't looked like that in 10 to 12 years.  Nice astronaut.  Still not really good.  No.  Still not really good.  Yeah, very good.  She limits your...  Well, that's not bad.  I would cum in that hair.  Even youth doesn't help her. 
[02:29:30]  The best she gets is just weird fantasies like that.  Well, I would jerk off in her face.  That's right.  She's not getting like, I would make passionate love.  No, it's like...  Yeah, love in the face.  We got E-Rock in studio.  We got to be very careful with this hint, hint, okay?  But, E-Rock, tell me what you heard.  There's a transcript online of a caller Rush took on his show yesterday comparing...  There's an actual transcript, though?  Yeah.  Look at how nervous you are.  Because I'm trying to...  You're breathing heavy. 
[02:30:00]  You just swallow.  Like, you just did...  Comparing that involuntary swallow when you're all nervous.  Comparing Obama to Curious George.  All right.  Oh, no.  The caller, when Limbaugh was laughing about it...  Oh, so Limbaugh laughed about it.  Laughed at it.  Supposedly.  Yeah.  The caller may have been making monkey sounds.  Oh, and Limbaugh didn't hear it or was laughing over it, and that's what the controversy was.  Yeah, okay.  So we don't know if that was true or not. 
[02:30:30]  All right.  Look how we have to tiptoe.  We're trying to find audio.  I know.  We're trying to find audio of this.  Isn't it, Jimmy?  He went to break and then came back and did about 10 to 15 minutes of apologies.  Do we have that audio?  No.  None of this audio surfaced yet.  We have no audio.  Who do you not apologize to in the office?  It's a fucking radio show.  It's a surface.  It's not hitting me.  It's got to be somewhere.  So nobody hit it.  It was a preemptive apology.  This is so great, though.  No one's taping him where they...  This is a hidden lesson.  Someone has the audio.  He apologized before...  50 bucks on his site to get it.  He apologized before anybody complained. 
[02:31:00]  That's fantastic.  He apologized to the man with the yellow hat for making fun of his friend.  That's right.  Well, we're trying to get that.  I'm familiar with that story.  Yes.  We're trying to get that audio.  I, for one, hope it isn't true.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're a good man.  I hope it isn't true.  Hey, we did get it.  Hold on, hold on.  Rush didn't say the Curious George thing.  It was a caller.  Please get it right.  We said that, Lon.  Yeah, we said that.  Come on, dummy.  We said that. 
[02:31:30]  The whole thing that Rush was laughing.  Fucking E-Rock said the audio hasn't surfaced.  Surfaced.  You got any footage of that movie landing?  Now they're hiding it.  Footage of the movie?  Fucking incompetent shit dick.  Get in here.  Yeah.  The audio hasn't surfaced from that major nationally syndicated radio show.  Exactly.  Listened to by more people than anyone on earth.  Yeah.  It's like Rush whispered this to someone.  But no one can dig it up.  He fucking sent it to a microphone so it would go out speakers.  You fucking Hillary face cunt.  Go get it.  Fucking, I'll wrap your neck around my dick and just fuck your under face. 
[02:32:00]  Ask somebody who's making a phone call in a Dunkin' Donuts and they've got it on their fucking...  Jesus.  Somebody's leaving somebody a message.  Hey, we got an update on the Jane Fonda thing, too.  Oh, when she dropped the C-bomb.  She never said it.  Well, I know you're...  Well...  Amazing.  I know when it started, there were some A-list celebrities who came out to help you, but  Jane, you at first were not a big fan of the play, so what turned you around?  Well, it wasn't that I wasn't a big fan. 
[02:32:30]  I hadn't seen the play.  I live in Georgia, okay?  I was asked to do a monologue called Cunt.  And I said, I don't think so.  I got enough problems.  But then you were invited to go see it.  Fucking love Jane Fonda right now.  It's in a monologue.  It's called Cunt.  First of all...  I got enough problems.  I love all of this.  She said cunt like you're supposed to say it.  She said cunt.  Cunt.  Like you came from underneath.  But you know what?  That's not even her line.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  There's a female comic.  I don't know if it was Cunt or Caroline Wright.  One of them said that in their act.  Really? 
[02:33:00]  Yes.  It's not even her fucking line.  So she stole it?  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  And then you hear Meredith Vieira laughing at her, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Now she's denying she didn't even really hear it.  Because I didn't hear it.  She was turned away from me.  I wasn't even in the room.  I fucking didn't hear it with my kids.  Cunt.  Cunt.  That's the update right there.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Yeah.  She claims she never heard Jane Fonda say it.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  She's laughing at it.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  And then Meredith had this to say.  Before we go to break, in our last half hour, we were talking about the vagina monologues  and Jane Fonda inadvertently said a word from the play that you don't say on television. 
[02:33:30]  It was a slip and obviously she apologizes and so do we.  We would do nothing to offend the audience.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Please accept that apology and when we come up.  I'm not accepting it.  We're going to be talking about the secrets to making your love last.  A nice sight.  Cunt.  There's so much.  God damn it.  That's the secret right there.  Get a 12 year old cunt.  Get your fucking.  Fucking.  Get a 12 year old cunt transplanted into your old body. 
[02:34:00]  That'll make your love last.  Jesus.  Cut out that 40 year old box.  And you replace it.  Fucking switch it out.  Oh my.  Fill your pussy with rocks.  So there's something for him to run against.  Buy six pounds of chicken livers and sew it in there.  Switch out your old pussy for your daughters, you fucking useless whore.  Switch it out.  It's a fucking filleting knife.  Get the pit crew to put a new one in.  The Penske team surrounding it.  It's 10 seconds.  Done.  Fuck her again. 
[02:34:30]  Oh shit.  My belly hurts.  She just was denying everything now.  Well now she's saying she never even heard it.  She was laughing.  Never heard it.  She apologized.  Can you fucking imagine?  Wonderful.  Can you imagine?  She laughed at it.  She fucking gave it a nice fat laugh.  Like that guy in Onsana.  Let's go to Andrew on Long Island.  Andrew.  Andrew.  Hello there.  Yeah.  I heard the comment yesterday.  Oh you did.  I was in a rush right after you guys.  Alright.  And uh.  The lady didn't make any sounds in the background. 
[02:35:00]  All she uh.  Did was compare that.  Her son said that he looked like Curious George.  Yeah.  And Rush just laughed right after it.  When Rush got back on the air.  He really didn't apologize.  He kind of made a joke about it.  Stating that uh.  How McCain had apologized.  Using his middle name.  So he's making a joke.  He didn't really apologize.  Okay.  He's joking around about it.  So he was.  According to Shaking E-Rock.  This was a national incident.  And the audio's been hidden in the archives.  And it hasn't surfaced yet.  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  Should we get E-Rock back in here?  I want to grab Eric's neck fat.  And pull it up over his head.  Let's say hi to Stryker.  Stryker what's up?  Like a sweater.  Good morning boys.  There was numerous references to the Curious George book on Rush yesterday.  He signed off his show by saying I'm sick.  I'm going home to read Curious George.  And then he made some comment about Obama.  Good for him.  For not fucking being a fucking little pussy about it.  Yeah he will.  Speaking of pussies E-Rock is back.  E-Rock.  E-Rock what's the matter you nervous Nelly? 
[02:36:00]  Nothing.  Okay.  Are you all frightened?  Look at you.  You're all scared.  What's up?  Can you blame him?  Look at the talent.  So some woman was saying that her child made the observation that Barack Obama looks like  Curious George.  Kids don't lie.  Oh kids are crazy.  Kids don't lie.  Kids say the darndest things.  Ouch.  Kids say the darndest things.  But look.  I mean.  Stop.  If you're a kid.  Seriously.  Only a child.  Oh my goodness.  Only a silly child.  Now which one's Barack?  Would see. 
[02:36:30]  Let's say hi to Blake in Virginia.  Blake.  E-Rock's leaving now.  There goes E-Rock.  E-Rock come back.  Only a silly child.  Oh my belly hurts.  Would make.  Dumb children.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  You guys are killing me.  E-Rock wants to talk to you.  Go ahead Blake.  Go.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  How you guys doing?  Good.  Hey.  I was listening to him yesterday.  He.  The woman.  Little kid.  Said.  By the way.  I think Obama looks like Curious George.  And he didn't apologize. 
[02:37:00]  And I was watching Saturday Night Live the other night.  And they were doing that Obama skit.  And he does.  He's got the exact same facial features.  Well you're saying that Fred Armisen dressed like Obama looks like Curious George.  But look if you're an actor and you try really hard to look like Obama.  And you end up a Curious George.  Yeah.  Then what does that say about a similarity?  Here's the audio right there.  Go find it.  Wasn't Obama actually on SNL too?  He was once.  Yeah.  He was once.  Yeah.  I know Hillary dropped in.  She was thrilling.  Well they did a thing.  By the way. 
[02:37:30]  The thing that he did.  No.  It was Hillary being at a costume party.  And there's a guy dressed like Obama.  He's wearing an Obama mask.  And he takes it off and it's him.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  Ah.  That's right.  Yeah.  Clever.  Yeah.  But the mask was kind of funny.  Was it?  Yeah.  It was Obama.  If he becomes president Obama masks are going to be very.  Oh huge.  He was a seller.  Very offensive.  They are.  Well that's the thing is that like Nixon masks and those masks they're meant to like really  caricature and make fun of and give the worst of the guy. 
[02:38:00]  Right.  So if there's a black president and they make an Obama mask it's going to.  True.  It ain't going to be pretty.  Yeah.  Because like a Nixon mask always had that ski slope nose and everything.  Big nose.  Big nose.  The Reagan mask.  Big jowls.  Yeah.  Had the big jowls and stuff.  Yeah.  So what is this going to have?  It's not going to allow you to make that mask.  No.  That mask won't be able to make it.  It's going to have paper thin lips.  It's going to be a really.  It's going to look like Warren Hutchinson.  Remember that?  Yes.  It's going to be.  It's going to be really dignified.  It'll also have to like come with gloves.  Yes.  Oh for the.  Well white people.  Yeah you can't. 
[02:38:30]  You know you can go around with a mask without gloves.  Yeah.  Otherwise you're not doing a proper impersonation.  For all these years of having a white president we just could put the mask on and walk around.  Come out with gloves and 16 foot shoes.  That's a funny.  Oh she's on.  She was on the Daily Show huh?  Well.  That whole liberal media thing was just a big lie wouldn't it?  She did cheek implants?  Did Hillary get cheek implants?  Hopefully.  Hopefully they're delivered with a fist.  Look at that.  She is in pain when she has to smile like she did get some fucking.  Look at her.  She's like a fucking squirrel. 
[02:39:00]  Petrified jizz injected into her cheek.  That's where she keeps Bill's balls in her cheeks.  Look at Joe Scarborough.  Look at Scarborough with his fucking fucking inbred eyes.  Look at those dime slots.  This guy's good.  Well he took over for Ivis and now Chuck Nice is part of the.  There's not enough fucking writing on the screen.  Look at that.  Wait why is Chuck Nice on TV and I'm not.  That is so they can't pull an Imus.  Yeah.  He's on with who?  Chuck's there so.  Chuck Scarborough.  To go for Ivis. 
[02:39:30]  And that way if there's any racial controversy.  Chuck is on there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See what.  Nick's had it.  Nick just put his head down.  You don't want to be there.  You don't want to be there.  Yeah I do.  At this fucking point I do.  That's how fucking.  You want to be on fucking.  On morning TV.  Laughing at people that are funny.  I'd rather be on my blog radio talking to six people.  If you do fucking morning TV.  You're going to be fucking apologizing like a fucking.  A pilot in captivity in Iraq. 
[02:40:00]  Fucking in about 10 minutes.  He was a black guy.  I did in no mean.  No means.  I did in no way mean to offend.  The African American immunity.  That's a good one man.  You'll be doing that in a second.  Our country is waging an illegal war.  I love that one.  It's like right after they pull that bomb handle.  The second they go down and get caught.  This country is a legal war against your country and its people.  It's horrible.  That's what these apologists look like when people apologize for their fucking curses. 
[02:40:30]  They look like they got a fucking AK-47 in their head.  They should hold a newspaper with the date on it.  I'm sorry I said what I said about your town.  Looking around like you know just off camera is an AK-47 muzzle.  Trying to blink another message to your wife.  That's hilarious.  Please help me.  That's what they look like.  Yeah.  And it's on weird videotape from another country.  I should never have said it.  It's a horrible thing.  Please.  Cut my head off please.  I just don't want to hear how hard it is for a fucking place. 
[02:41:00]  Alright we're going to take a break and get the Rush audio.  They're getting it now.  Oh they're getting it?  How did they find it?  I don't know Jimmy.  How did they find such hidden audio?  It hasn't surfaced.  Something so obscure.  Just the fact that he used the word surface.  I'll tell you how they found it.  They logged on.  Yeah.  It's not like we're asking you to find a fucking snuff film.  They tuned the radio to 15 different stations that carry Rush.  In every town.  But E-Rock says it hasn't surfaced yet.  He was just shaking like a blithering idiot.  He was so nervous.  He found it by cupping his hand around his ear and craning his neck a little to the right. 
[02:41:30]  Ah there it is.  It's in the air in America.  He's trying to say it's hard to find Rush Limbaugh audio in this day and age.  I don't know.  It hasn't surfaced yet.  Oh these guys.  During the Limbaugh generation.  These guys just suck.  I wish he'd go swimming and not surface.  We'll be back in just a bit.  A little joke about him drowning.  What's up Joanne?  This Jimmy guy, he's useless.  No one cares about that.  That's very nice.  Be a little more effective if a man called in.  Dumb broad.  Dumb broad.  Hold on, hold on. 
[02:42:00]  The man's talking.  Being abroad, we take your opinion a little less seriously.  Dumb broad.  And right now, hold on.  The man is talking.  Dumb broad.  Dumb broad.  That smells.  The bottom line is you should be on your knees scrubbing a toilet and laughing at what  the men said.  Lee Anthony.  Right back at it.  O and A.  Supposedly Randy Spears is on the line. 
[02:42:30]  I am.  The dude that got in trouble on Long Island.  I don't know if this is true, but we'll see.  Randy.  No, I'm not.  I'm at work and the final puzzle is back.  Oh, well, thank you.  You have a great day today.  Okay.  You guys have a great day too.  Bye, Yankee fan Kevin.  Mike from Kings Park.  Oh, my.  For the bumper stickers, Mike.  Oh, yeah.  You know, I had to wait.  I had to hold off because you've got, you know, he had this meeting and stuff.  Well, he is back, Mike.  So how do you feel?  This is WBLI, obviously.  Well, thank you, Mike. 
[02:43:00]  He did his apology.  He did his thing.  And now he's back.  And now we can get back to normal life here with the radio.  Exactly.  We're so excited to be all back together.  Please put us on with this clown on the show.  And you were so sweet and so supportive in such a nice way.  Shut up, Paul.  So it was great to hear from you all along.  Every time she talks, I wish she'd just fly across the table to a fucking jawline.  Yeah.  I want to say hi to Randy.  Oh, is this Diane?  Your fucking voice is a homing beacon for fucking right beating fist. 
[02:43:30]  Just hands with no bodies attached to the floor.  Listen to this dribble.  Wait, wait, get right back into it.  I spent my whole weekend watching Randy videos.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Wait, did you go to WBLI.com and all the YouTube videos?  She should be circling a fucking Yorkshire Terrier.  What about the ones that they kept flashing on the news when you were dancing to the damn milkshake?  If you get on, just don't curse.  You're on regular radio.  I don't know what they're trying to do.  I'm sure it isn't a listener just holding his phone up to the radio.  Sounds like we're on hold. 
[02:44:00]  Hi, I just wanted to welcome Randy back.  We have, I've missed him.  I'm a resident of Randy.  I don't hear the Randy guy, though.  No, I'm trying to figure out who Randy is.  I'm a Mastic Beach listener.  I gotta tell you, I love everybody's Mastic.  Is that him right there?  Yeah, that's him.  Oh.  How's that my answer?  Oh.  He really has like a...  I said, Alan Seuss in the house.  Alan Seuss.  He's got like one of those sort of halfway through hormonal treatment voices. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Like he's halfway to getting a pussy put in.  No, he sounds like a woman to man transformation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's where I'm...  I thought that was in Riley.  Wait, wait, wait.  We'll talk idle and all the fun and frivolity, of course, as usual.  Bye, everybody.  Wood Kingdom, not only built the finest...  Is that the big closer?  Yeah, it's a good show.  Randy.  Yes.  That was you on that awful show?  What's that?  What's that?  What are you crazy guys saying?  You just forced us to listen to BLI for five minutes, and I just heard awfulness. 
[02:45:00]  Oh!  Poor thing, it's not my fault.  Anthony, I saw your pictures on the web, kind of cute.  That's him?  Yeah, I get it.  Gay guy, like, hitting on me.  Why?  You're good looking.  It's not wrong with that.  What?  I'm just saying you're kind of cute.  You're not my type.  Randy.  What?  You were forced to read that statement at the press conference?  Ooh. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  We've been there.  We've been there.  We understand.  You were forced to read that, huh?  Did I say how cute you were?  A little hard to swallow, huh?  Well, maybe not for you.  But, I mean, when you're reading a statement like that, it's kind of rough to have to, you  know, spit that out.  Randy.  Damn it.  No, I spit.  No.  We stood up for you guys, but, man, that John Shea that runs that station, what a lame  ass.  He should have stuck up for you guys and just said, shut up, Mastic. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  My boy was making a little joke, and that's all it is.  That's exactly right.  They have a $7 million pool out there.  No one said anything about that, did they?  Yeah, huh?  Thank you.  That's because they embezzled it from the school district or some stuff.  But no one got all up and up in arms about that, did they?  No, but now I'm kind of seeing why nobody from the station got behind you.  Why?  It's safer than in front.  Swimwalk. 
[02:46:30]  Swimwalk.  So, you're safe now in your job?  No problems?  As far as I know.  Is this gay Marco?  It's real.  As far as you know.  It's real, I think.  No, it's me, Randy.  Oh, no, it's not.  Oh, it's Fez.  You motherfucker.  This is fake.  You motherfucker.  This is me, Randy.  Wait a minute.  Nobody says it's me, Randy.  Like, nobody says.  It's me, Randy.  What?  Are we allowed to swear on this show? 
[02:47:00]  Yes.  Oh, you dumb motherfuckers.  I am Randy.  Oh, well.  I really am.  Is that fucking Ron and Fez?  It's fucking Ron and Fez.  That's crazy.  So, they got the end of the show on tape?  You did production for this gag?  You guys don't work this hard.  That's hysterical.  I was so eager for a scoop.  I don't care.  If he says it's him, it must be him.  Huh?  I want to come down and see you guys down there at that studio of yours.  Yeah, you come down any time. 
[02:47:30]  Usually from noon to three.  Poke chop, poke chop.  Greasy, Greasy.  We can beat your team.  Greasy, easy.  What the hell are these idiots doing today?  We got to go meet with management.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, there's so many damn meetings.  One after another, I can't even take a...  Take a... 
[02:48:00]  Take a...  I got that guy from Channel 12 News,  and they didn't put that on the air, the fuckers.  He was so cute, you guys.  I took him by surprise.  He was so serious and everything,  and I looked right at him.  I said, what's your name?  And he told me.  I can't even remember.  I said, well, you're kind of cute.  The poor bastard, he didn't know what to do.  What to do?  I gave him my number. 
[02:48:30]  What the hell?  You guys, I could just talk to you forever.  What's on your agenda today?  It matches the actual show so perfectly.  It really does.  It's really good.  Because the show that they were playing was god-awful.  Yeah.  And you sound god-awful.  God loves me, and he doesn't tell me I sound awful. 
[02:49:00]  I just spoke to him last night.  I was like, oh, God.  Oh, God.  Well, it's about time Fezzie comes out of the closet.  We got a big scoop on the Ron and Fez front today.  Ron and Fez.  New to three.  9.30 till three.  Yeah.  Apparently.  Ronnie.  You cute little things.  I'll lick you later.  Ronnie.  Ron. 
[02:49:30]  Ron.  Who's Ron?  Ron.  Ron Bennington.  Fez Watley.  Ron.  Ron and Fez show.  Andy Spears.  Miss Spears.  Do you obey?  Is Eastside Dave there?  Yeah.  Where's Eastside Dave?  Is Eastside Dave?  Who's he playing?  The hole?  The hole.  The part of the hole?  You bastards.  I gotta go.  All right.  I love you long time.  All right.  All right.  See you later, Fez.  Bye.  Bye, Fez.  Did you hear Ron in the background, right? 
[02:50:00]  Hopefully it had to be Ron and Fez.  I fucking have no idea.  Uh, let's say hi to Chris in the Bronx.  Chris, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  This thing, guy, girl, whatever it was, sounds like one of those carnies.  Do you throw balls at them for $3 at the end of the day?  They dunk the dummy tanks.  Pardon me.  Boo!  At the end of the day?  At the end of the day?  At the end of the day.  At the end of the day.  Oh, that was a collar puller.  These guys are going to laugh so hard when I hear this.  When are you guys going to laugh so hard? 
[02:50:30]  When I say this, they're going to invite me on the show.  I'm going to say, I think it's a part of the show.  Go check.  At the end of the day?  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  Back to my job.  That's the punchline.  At the end of the day.  Back to my job, yeah.  Oh, well.  Make another box.  So was that Ron and Fence?  I don't know.  They didn't break character.  No, it was actually Randy.  We're out of flux.  Randy Spears?  Remember the welding flux?  Because Louie goes, is that Randy?  This is fake?  And you go, no, no, no, that's him.  It was just funny that you said that.  Oh, okay.  You said that with complete confidence. 
[02:51:00]  Is this Randy?  Yes, it's Randy.  I thought it was Randy.  Like, how could you not know?  It's Randy.  Come on.  Yeah, I don't think after apologizing like that, he would come on this program and talk like that.  And, uh, although he did look a little queenish.  Earrings.  A lot of people saying, yo, that definitely wasn't Fez.  Now I have no fucking idea.  It might have been Dave and Ron.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Or Lily.  But it sounded like the character from the show.  Exactly.  But it was too perfect. 
[02:51:30]  The show ends and then they jump on the air with us like that.  That's why they did that.  Yeah, they had the phone probably up to the radio.  But they're like us.  They don't like producing a show.  Well, it's only 10 a.m. now, so you think they signed off a few minutes ago?  That was really well conceived, though.  To have it sound like we're on hold.  Right.  Because you guys know that you hear the show while you're on hold.  Right.  And then the show's over.  And then hear the show end and then come back.  I mean, it took the confidence that you wouldn't just go, oh, this is where we're on hold.  And hang up.  Yeah.  You hung out. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It was smart.  Fucking all of a stone directing over there?  It's a big mystery.  Now we've got to figure this out.  Guys tell all the truth about sex and relations.  Yeah.  I'm sure that paints men in a good light, right?  Yeah.  The Chinese cunt in the middle.  Anyways.  She's very sexy, but she's got a deeper voice than me.  Why don't we get all this?  Yeah, look at all this.  The one on the left looks like a fucking guy.  Guy in drag.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Oh, my God.  Carrie's pretty hot, man.  Or not even in drag.  That is a guy.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God. 
[02:52:30]  It's Michelle Obama.  Don't be working your traps some more, you dyke.  We're watching the Today Show.  Did you see her with that sweater on a couple weeks ago?  I think she's a beard for him.  I really don't.  Do you?  She's beautiful.  Why don't you use gay?  Yeah.  Very hot.  But she had a voice like this.  Next up, chicken salad recipes.  Do you like nuts and celery in them?  I'm going to give you a good firm stool.  We'll be right back.  This woman looks like John Leguizamo.  Yes.  With the wig on. 
[02:53:00]  Say hello to fucking Scott LaRose.  What is this crap?  Oh, God.  Look at it.  This is what they picked to speak for men.  Guys.  Now they're spinning it this morning.  And the fact that she's now having to fight for her political life shows that the momentum  is all on their side.  How would you respond to that?  Actually, I think most political observers would say just the opposite.  That's not the channel we want.  We want the other channel.  We want the other channel.  We want the other channel.  We want the other channel.  We want the other channel.  We want the other channel in Texas.  Hello.  Who's it?  We want the guys to tell all the truth about sex and relations.  Hello.  How do I change this? 
[02:53:30]  Gay guys tell all about straight guys.  That's who they speak for us.  Yeah.  A bunch of gay looking gentlemen.  Seemingly.  I just think this changed really fast.  We want to listen to that.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, it's like, I suggest that Democrats really have some doubts about a...  Nope.  Nope.  That's still up top.  ...marriage.  There you go.  Andy, Andy, Andy.  Many years.  You've got many years.  15 years married.  So many years.  Yes.  Tell me.  What do you do?  Well, you know, spark is spark.  You know, when you're hot, you're hot. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Swallow another love.  When you're not, you're not.  You know, but it's all about communication.  Shut up.  It's all about communication.  It is not.  It's all about communication.  It's all about communication.  I'm not the same guy I was when I married my wife.  Because I'm gay with sperm in my mouth.  Yeah.  I'm not the same guy I was when I married my wife.  I'm not the same guy I was when I married my wife.  Diddle, you fucking click.  Like, oh, it's Wednesday.  That's why.  Isn't a guy saying that?  Wednesday is good.  Wednesday is very, very good.  Today is Tuesday, which means...  It is about communication.  I got a hard dick and I'll fucking realize that the person that you are married to is still that beautiful  woman or for women and for women and for women and for women and for women and for women. 
[02:54:30]  I don't even know you're a gay man.  You have to remember.  You're a woman as much as you do or as much as you wanted to back in the day.  So now you have to keep doing the things.  We're not talking about rape.  We're not talking about things that you used to do.  Now, be real.  Are you still romancing them like you used to do?  Yes, I do.  I try to be creative.  I try to do stuff like sometimes I just take off all my clothes.  Sometimes I suck a man's penis.  Try to mix it up a little bit.  And pretend it's like.  If no one else enjoys it, I had a good time and she's had a laugh. 
[02:55:00]  When we were at the back talking, just before we came on air, we were talking about how you keep that far.  Yeah.  We're not going to talk about the wigs and the lingerie.  What we're going to say.  The one you're wearing at the back.  Let me ask you two guys.  Are you guys romantics?  I mean, when you show up, I don't know, whether it's a date or whether it's to your girlfriend,  do you come with the flowers and the chocolates or do you get into the romance part?  I mean, I'm a chef, so I've got to be.  It's got to be about food.  It's got to be about nice wines, candlelight.  You know, a bit of, I sort of think romance comes from a situation. 
[02:55:30]  It really does.  It comes from a date rape drug.  Fucking roofie.  I get rough.  It's creative though, right?  Romance is definitely a big piece of it.  I just had this conversation with my girlfriend.  They're all gay!  I know.  They're all gay.  That's who speaks for us today.  It's why I'm a fucking hateful heterosexual.  It's not about the sex all that much.  It's about how they feel.  So our biggest thing.  It's the little love notes.  It's the love notes.  I left my wife a love note. 
[02:56:00]  Make them important to us.  Women also take a little longer to warm up.  So guys, we're always ready.  Because, see, we're just, we don't know.  It's like, so we need to be ready at a moment's notice.  We like that.  To what?  To bust into a condom?  Women aren't always ready.  So you got to foreplay.  Take it slow.  Foreplay is whatever is leading up to sex.  It might be in the morning when you leave the house.  What do you know?  A wrinkle next.  And then you go out and you call it during the day.  This should be called guys tell things.  This is what passes Saracen. 
[02:56:30]  After 16 years, you know, there's a lot of just life intruding all the time.  So, yeah, sex is easy.  The romance can be hard.  Pardon the pun.  And the truth of all, Dick Joe, how to find out, Dick Joe.  We weren't even going there.  You might have been going there.  We were going to find ways all the time to reinvent ourselves, to keep things fresh.  Because the glass is the latest one.  All right, let's take a look at our next question.  This is from Whitney from New York.  She asks, what happens after you hook up on the first date? 
[02:57:00]  Let's take a look at our question.  You know, the cops come to my house and go, where's the head?  My question is, if you hook up with a guy on the first date, is there a potential for  it to go somewhere, or was it just a one-night stand?  How do men feel about the woman the next day, the day after?  The single guy.  I kind of felt like this was coming my way.  You know, look, I personally wouldn't judge somebody, whether they hooked up with you on  the first date or not.  I think that every situation is different. 
[02:57:30]  You know, it depends on how it came about.  Did you meet him in a nightclub and then end up back at the hotel room?  How about if she wiped her ass on your towels before she left?  Now, when you judge her, you fucking fag.  Brett, you have a little bit of a different point of view on that, right?  No.  Yeah, I believe that it can turn into something.  You know, I'm listening to a very natural, innocent sort of flow of a relationship.  Are you, you fucking fagola?  It's like your brother's neck, fucking white gay douche.  Maybe she did that yesterday.  I mean, isn't that kind of propping up in your head?  I think it has a lot to do with the self-esteem and maturity of the man. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  And also, like you said, the situation.  Go warm up my car.  It's the type of situation where you're out on a date and you're kind of going very well.  It just naturally progresses to the point where you wind up going further than you expected  on the first date.  That's a different story than if you had a frat party back and, you know, down in alcoholic  beverages.  And then you wake up the next morning and you don't remember how you got there.  We had an interesting segment on yesterday, which we were talking about sexlessness.  I still feel about a relationship that doesn't lead to sex right away. 
[02:58:30]  It's disgusting.  It should never happen.  Let's be honest.  Wow.  Wow.  It's easy there, guys.  Sometimes the longer you wait, the better it is.  Yeah.  Like forever.  You must wait a long time, you fat.  Wait for that dirty vagina.  There truly is a sexual compatibility.  Now, if you're expecting a guy to be totally cold turkey and go into a serious relationship  with you that might even lead to marriage without ever having any type of sexual contact 
[02:59:00]  with you, the risk that you could wind up in a situation where you're just like, I can't  be married with someone who I have no sex with at all.  There's so many ways to connect on.  Like for women, for us, we connect on so many different levels.  I mean, sex is just one of those levels.  You're so complex.  Guys, it seems like, okay, you're like one-nosed darling.  You're acting on so many levels, the fucking wallet and the cunt.  Yeah.  You're a real fucking enigma.  You're a real enigma.  You're a real enigma. 
[02:59:30]  You're so much more.  We're so complicated.  Somebody lays the complexity, you fucking.  We want your comment and your money both, so try to figure that out.  You know, when somebody cooks for you, you go out of their house and the first thing  you do is you smell what they've cooked, you know, and you get a big side of it.  It's just the anticipation of the meal.  Yeah, nothing gets me harder than fucking eggs over easy, you faggot.  You know, sex, I don't think it's just an act.  I think it's something more than that.  It's something really special.  And it's something to share with you.  It's a dick in my fucking ass. 
[03:00:00]  It's a dick in my fucking ass.  It's a dick in my fucking ass all day.  Yeah, that's one of the things about that is also, but when you're having sex in a committed  relationship...  I'm with you because we're both men and we're gay.  It's much more intense.  Listen to this fucking...  This guy...  No better sexual guy would ever say that, ever, in a million fucking years, ever.  I've met in relationships where sex came later on.  Let's not bring the fucking police into this.  If I knew that we were sexually compatible...  Yeah, but we're talking about consensual sex.  He said sex in a committed relationship is so much more...  And there's so many ways to communicate. 
[03:00:30]  That guy, he's a phony.  He's never seen a snout in his life.  No, he hasn't.  Never.  But it's just that most guys aren't going to really go for that.  Again, we're talking about consensual sex.  Even if he is waiting for you, he may not be waiting.  He's like, well, I won't have sex with you, but I will have some sex.  He has...  Okay, well, moving on.  Yeah, yeah, very effeminate.  To another great point.  I respect your wishes.  You know, that guy knows when the date's over and somebody blows a rape whistle.  Anita from New York asks about how she can tell the guy is lying to her about having sex with other women. 
[03:01:00]  To your point.  Let's take a look.  I'm wondering, how do you tell if a man is lying about sleeping with other women if he says they're just friends?  If his crotch smells like a blimper.  Why would it matter to you, you ugly whore?  And they know when something's up.  And it's very simple.  If you can see sort of the inconsistencies...  No, they don't.  I've cheated my whole life.  You're fucking dumb as a bag of hands.  Wrench your dick, go home and go, hey, I'm going to watch a ball game. 
[03:01:30]  Fucking stop it.  If you suck his dick and there's shit on the tip, chances are he's been with someone else where he tripped.  Yeah, let's ask Bo Jackson's younger brother.  Stupid.  How do you guys hide being gay from your wives?  Yeah, that's the question, exactly.  And that relationship is doomed.  That's a great point.  It's all about the trust in you.  And if you have to ask the question, you will probably already have your answer. 
[03:02:00]  Because even, you know, like you said, even if the answer is no, the fact that you have asked the question shows a lack of trust.  Yes, and there's so many other things that are probably going to happen.  It's all on your mind, bitch.  Well, sometimes it may be coming from another relationship.  When he comes home and he's saying pepper spray.  She knows he's been cheating.  It may have nothing to do with the relationship.  It's not about you.  That's all I'm watching his face.  Will you put him on another chat?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You see a sketch of him on fucking the local news.  Have you seen this man?  Ask him to give my vagina back. 
[03:02:30]  For men and women when it comes to having casual sex.  Let's take a listen.  Why dismembered tits in his sock drawer?  Why men think they're the only ones.  They can be the only ones to have casual sex without attachment.  And women can't.  Well, you need to.  I'm so sick of this question.  That's so fucking...  This guy's out of control.  He's the bad boy.  Yeah.  Because he's wearing a ripped hoodie. 
[03:03:00]  He thinks he's right fucking Stuart.  When guys are out having casual sex,  I think that we have a healthy understanding that women do the same thing.  But are those the kind of girls that you're building a lasting relationship with?  Yes.  That's the thing to remember.  There is a double standard.  Because when I look at a woman and they're kind of being like that.  Very casual.  You don't like that, do you, faggot?  The wholesomeness.  You don't want them for the long haul.  I don't want them.  It's to be the mother of my children.  I do.  The mother of my children.  Some girl licks my asshole the first day.  I'm getting her a ring within an hour. 
[03:03:30]  I want to use her as a cum spittoon for the next 40 years.  Next time she licks your asshole, there's a little ring in there.  That's how you...  Hey, lick my asshole.  Do it again.  She's six and talking.  What is that?  Oh, I love you.  She's crying.  How romantic.  It's shit on the ring still.  It's two carrots and a piece of corn.  My wife is on the road with Major Rock and Roll.  Oh, okay.  I'm the kind of person.  I don't care about what you did before me. 
[03:04:00]  As a matter of fact, don't hurt me.  Just don't tell me.  Don't even tell me.  Okay, wait.  Can I ask you guys to come back again for our next segment?  That was great.  Are you guys great?  No, you guys are great.  All four of you, we expect you back.  You're right.  He's a pussy connoisseur.  Thank you.  And we come back while you may want to use those gift cards that you got for Christmas  today, right after these messages.  Yeah, that's...  Yeah, that's stressing.  Wow.  That's fucking garbage.  Drivel.  How the fuck am I not a trillionaire?  I don't understand. 
[03:04:30]  The whole...  The gay guys talking for...  There's another white man being betrayed while in a commercial.  There you go.  It's like a carrot.  It's like that movie, American Beauty.  Remember that movie?  Oh.  Where they got...  Infuriating.  Kevin Spacey playing the man.  Heterosexual, yeah.  And he's in love...  He wants to fuck...  He's fantasizing about fucking a cheerleader in high school.  Right.  And the way they represent this in this gay movie...  It really was.  This fucking bunch of come-through-a-projector that this movie was is... 
[03:05:00]  This is a fucking...  This is a...  This is a man...  When you fantasize...  According to this movie, when you fantasize about a cheerleader...  Right.  You lay on your back and flower petals fall all over you.  Right.  Rose petals just fall all over your body.  That's what you think about.  Yeah.  Instead of just like her hot, sweaty ass...  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the confused look on her face...  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  As you fucking cum in her stupid eye.  And then bash her brains in with her own pom-poms.  And just fucking hold her throat and tell her not to tell people.  As you throw her into her cab and she's crying. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, exactly.  You fucking bleach your hair and move out of town.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Or you yell, give me a C, give me a U, give me an N, give me a T, as you punch her in  the belly.  No rose petals needed.  Avoid her calls when she skips her period a fucking month later.  She's holding a middle of light on her eye to put down the swelling.  When it's done, I want the sheets to look like there are rose petals on it.  Exactly.  Are you spotting her to wear a fucking...  To her shiner? 
[03:06:00]  You make her wear a fucking cheerleading outfit while you give her ass to mouth.  Exactly.  God.  No, it's Kevin Spacey with this sweet look on his face and his flower petals.  Yeah.  And also, like, cluck music, you know, jazzy music.  Yeah.  That music with the...  Yeah, that's how you fantasize.  With those wooden blocks.  Fuck yeah.  And then the Marine at the end of the movie, the Marine, of course, the ex-Marine is really...  Yeah, he's the one who's really gay.  None of us are gay.  It's actually that one hetero guy.  He's the gay one. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  No one else is gay.  Yeah.  Kevin Spacey's not gay.  Yeah, no.  Fuck.  He's fucking straight as an arrow.  He lifts weights, listens to Zeppelin, drives a Firebird, and thinks about fucking rose petals.  Yeah, the rose petals really...  And then when he actually sees her tits, he wants...  He almost vomits.  Yeah.  And puts a blanket around her.  Yeah.  Where the fuck is the fucking man?  There's no man there.  No, absolutely not.  He finally sees the 18-year-old tits and goes, what have I been doing all the time?  I forgot I like men and their anathons. 
[03:07:00]  I forgot I like...  Exactly.  ...suck cock.  I don't like vaginas.  They're disgusting.  E-Rock found the Rush Limbaugh audio.  Oh, he did, finally.  It surfaced.  Where's E-Rock?  It was on RushLimbaugh.com.  Of course it was.  It was actually on OpieAnthony.com.  He got it from your show.  He actually went into the future to get it.  That's how long it took.  He went into five minutes from now.  Where's E-Rock? 
[03:07:30]  I don't know.  Is he coming in?  Whoa, look at Ohio, folks.  Jesus.  It's tied.  It's tied up 44%.  She's finished.  Oh, boy.  But Texas Hillary's winning by a little bit.  That's weird, because it was the other way around a few days ago.  No.  The poll's just open.  She's tough.  She's a fighter.  Oh, the rednecks are coming out in Texas.  E-Rock, I see the audio.  Surfaced, huh?  That's a small portion of it.  Huh?  That's a small portion of it.  We just got the whole story.  What?  That's a small portion?  You hear us go, hello.  Hello. 
[03:08:00]  Welcome to the...  That's it.  Can we hear what portion we have?  That's all they have.  You know, Obama can talk about the future, and the Clintons can talk about the past.  I stand up for the right now.  I'm big on the right now.  Somebody's got to be for right now, and that's me.  Hey, listen.  My 12-year-old daughter, she heard a statement last week was, who cares what the guy's middle  name is?  He looks like Curious George.  Don't let me laugh.  I can't laugh.  The point that we're going to make to you is, you're going to have to be very careful 
[03:08:30]  how you try to disabuse...  You don't have to disabuse him.  All right.  He heard the comment.  He laughed at the comment, and then realized that he was like a nervous titter.  I think it was a polite con...  A mercy laugh.  Yeah, like, ha ha ha, don't make me laugh.  Kind of a mercy laugh.  She had shitty timing, anyway.  That wasn't a...  She wouldn't have funny...  Oh, God, that's funny.  Yeah.  She kind of threw it away, that line.  Yeah, she did.  She should have really punched monkey.  No.  She had no confidence.  If he was honest, he would have said, that's not funny.  Yeah, she should have punched monkey.  Fuck you, and fuck your kid. 
[03:09:00]  If he had any fucking...  Fucking hutch.  Well, I wouldn't say Curious George.  More like, uh...  What's the one on there?  Dr. Zayas.  Yeah.  And then the...  Oh, come on.  Don't make me laugh.  And then he came back from break and did this.  I never heard of Curious George until that caller...  Yes, you did, Rush.  No, he's kidding.  He's kidding.  He's kidding.  I mean, I think this is a joke he's making.  You think he's, like, being very sarcastic?  Yeah, he's making fun of the...  That he's probably...  That he knows...  Of all the pressure that's... 
[03:09:30]  Is that all you have?  I don't...  I don't know.  I don't care how old Curious George...  I never heard of Curious George.  I had no idea what she was talking about.  He's being facetious.  Oh, of course he is.  Now they tell me Curious George's a monkey.  Well, whoop-dee-dee.  No.  That's what you get coming in the second.  He's not kidding.  That's pretty balky.  I don't think he is.  I think he's kidding.  He's not kidding at all.  I don't think he is.  He's making an excuse for why he laughed.  Yeah.  I never heard of Curious George, and now this...  Because he has to acknowledge what it is.  He's trying to save his ass.  That's exactly...  Yeah, he was not kidding.  No, but he said...  Of course he heard of Curious George.  That's what I'm saying, is he's pretending. 
[03:10:00]  Because he says...  He's pretending he never heard of Curious George.  He says, I don't care how old he is.  Right.  Like, he's saying...  I mean, because there's nobody on Earth who doesn't know who Curious George is.  Yeah, Barack Obama.  He's lying, but he's not being ironic about it, going, of course I do.  He's lying.  Right.  Of course he knows who Curious George is.  Fucking...  I think he's saying it.  Well, that was a pretty good kind of way, though, that his listeners hear there's a little  sardonic in the voice.  Oh, I don't know.  You're just being a ditto head.  We're missing the obvious, by the way.  A lot of people pointing out that Iraq said small portion for the first time in his life. 
[03:10:30]  God, they're like lasers.  What else is there, Iraq?  God, they're better than fucking Clinton's advanced team that listens to everything and  issues faxes.  I'm cutting up a piece of audio now where he just goes on for several minutes listening  every cartoon that he's ever watched and what those cartoons consisted of.  All right.  And then apparently there's a caller calling him out saying he's a big liar and everything.  Oh, really?  Can I have more, please?  Stone guy mouth.  I've got...  Iraq, what's wrong?  It's all dry.  That's it.  Like, after you smoke too much pot, you just... 
[03:11:00]  Wait, is your mouth dry?  Iraq, was that audio hard to find?  The rest of it just showed up.  What, did he get a FedEx?  At the door?  Yeah.  Hello?  I'm recording.  He's going to come here and say it himself to her.  Send a UPS ground?  I didn't know.  We probably should have had that audio this morning.  It was out there.  I was looking for it.  I asked.  Nobody else could find it, so...  All right.  I didn't have it.  Get Eastside Dave.  I'm wondering if he's ready for our contest.  We said 10.30 today. 
[03:11:30]  And in other news, Brett Farr has announced his retirement.  Well, he had a good run.  God love him.  He is done.  God love him.  God love him.  What a great way to go out, throwing a fucking interception.  That's it.  That's his last memory.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  Now he's going to be like a...  What is he?  35?  A big one, too.  No, he's fucking 40.  I hope he shoots himself in a room.  He's going to own a fucking car dealership on some strip in Green Bay now.  No, in Oshkosh.  I'm going to be selling fucking Pontiacs.  Come down to Brett Favre's, yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Fucking...  What?  You got miles of savings.  They do that just to get out of the house, you know?  Awful.  Well, I know.  Oh, my God.  Awful.  Iraq is going to be fucking signing footballs at a fucking retard convention somewhere.  Iraq, Dave's requesting a minute.  He's still getting ready.  No, it's 10.30.  We play the new game with Eastside Dave.  All right, well...  What's the new game?  He's not going to do it in front of his wife, is he?  Yeah.  Aw, she's been...  Wait, Dave, it's not... 
[03:12:30]  We're not ready yet.  Do you want to do it now?  What the fuck?  Are you ready, Dave?  With this fucking show.  Hold on, hold on.  Get out there.  Hold on.  Are you ready to play this?  What the fuck are you doing?  Wait, I can't hear you.  Hold on.  It's noon to three.  Hold on, what?  RomFest noon to three.  Was I supposed to shove it up my ass before?  Because I did.  All right, hold on.  Or do you want me to shove it up on the air?  Wait, stay out there.  We've got to play the official promo.  Eastside Dave's here.  His wife's here.  He's got something in his ass.  His wife is on...  Does he? 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, well, yeah.  It's our new contest.  He just loves taking his ass off.  RomFest started this new war.  Goofy, like...  Goofy radio bits.  They got spinning the hit,  and now we came up with this.  Here's the official...  And she's holding the cup over his dick  while he takes his shirt off.  Oh, why does he have to take all his clothes off?  Yeah, he's got it, Louie.  Here's the intro to the new bit.  He's completely naked, and he's ready.  Except for he's going to yell.  And now, ladies and gentlemen,  it's time once again for  What's Up Eastside Dave's Box! 
[03:13:30]  Oh, okay.  Eastside Dave has stuck an object up his ass,  and Opie and Anthony have to figure out what it is.  Wow.  It's What's Up Eastside Dave's Box!  I heard this bit on NPR.  But now you know,  ladies and gentlemen,  Eastside Dave makes his way into the studio.  He's completely naked.  His wife's outside on the bleachers, mortified.  Eastside Dave is waddling into the studio.  Oh, his non-existent penis. 
[03:14:00]  But he's got his pants at his ankles like that.  What are you, shy about your ankles?  Like the Victorian era?  But you don't mind showing your dick and balls?  I can't take my pants off.  There's something in my asshole.  Oh, so, okay.  He actually has something up his ass,  and we have to guess.  Something up his ass,  and we have to guess.  Yes, we have to guess what's up  beside Dave's ass.  Do we get clues?  How does this work?  Do we ask him questions?  Yeah, we ask questions.  Yes or no questions would suffice, Ryan.  Is it bigger than a bread basket?  Wait, we get...  What's up your ass? 
[03:14:30]  That's not a yes or no question.  Is it a food product?  Yeah, let's start with Jimmy.  Is it a food product?  Very good.  Yes.  All right, it's food.  Is it in a wrapper right now,  or is it a bear?  I mean, okay, is it in a wrapper?  Yes.  What is it in a wrapper?  It's in a wrapper.  Is it a Snickers bar?  No.  Is it a Jolly Rancher?  No.  Is it a ham?  Hold on, hold on.  Is it a candy bar?  No.  All right, it's not a candy bar,  but it's in a wrapper.  All right, is it sweet?  It was. 
[03:15:00]  Yes, Mr. Anthony.  All right.  It's sweet.  It's in a wrapper.  A head of lettuce.  Is it covered in chocolate?  Yes.  Is it...  I didn't know that sticking things up your ass  is starting to force things to come out.  Wait, you said it wasn't a candy, though.  No, but it might be sweet.  He said it wasn't a candy bar.  Is it one of those emergency packets?  Like, you know, vitamin packets?  Because that would give you a paper cut.  No, but it is hurting.  Is it a fruit?  It's hurting.  What's it, a lobster? 
[03:15:30]  What's a...  Is it round?  Or is it oval?  Yes.  Hold on, hold on.  Why aren't we filming this?  We are.  We are.  Oh, I didn't see you, Sam.  I'm sorry.  Round in a wrapper.  It's sweet.  But it's covered with chocolate, too?  No, the chocolate was the poop.  It's a joke.  It's a shit joke.  Is it a ham?  Shit joke.  Is it red?  Is it red?  Uh, no, it's not red.  Oh, does it have a stick on it?  Yes.  All right. 
[03:16:00]  I would like to say...  Hold on.  Go ahead, Anthony.  ...it is a lollipop.  Oh, God.  He's going to pull it out.  It's still in the wrapper out of his head.  Don't touch it.  Jesus.  Specifically, it's a blow pop, guys.  A blow pop.  Oh, now he's gagging.  Because he put it in his mouth.  Oh, yeah.  Well, too bad.  Oh, fuck.  I don't know.  I'm getting turned on looking at his wife watching this. 
[03:16:30]  You're right, Dave.  Pop it in your mouth, Dave.  What are you doing?  I'm trying to get the wrapper off this.  Put it with the wrapper in your mouth.  Oh, Jesus.  He put the lollipop in his mouth.  What the fuck is wrong with this dude to three now?  Okay, so it's the game over.  Yeah, thank you.  Can I go back to doing prep for us?  I guess he's the wrong guy to ask about what's going on in Ohio right now as far as the election.  All right.  There's Dave putting his clothes back on. 
[03:17:00]  Dave, when are we playing?  What's up?  You saw Dave's ass again.  I'll have to talk to my higher-ups about that.  Whenever you want.  Right after the stitches heal.  In five minutes, if you ask him.  When Anthony guessed the lollipop, he pulled the lollipop out of his ass.  Yes.  Did he ever?  It was indeed up his ass.  Oh, God.  Sounded like a champagne cork.  Nice brow.  Look.  Oh, God.  Stop making yourself puke with your own shit on a lollipop.  You got the gig.  Don't worry.  People are going to know.  Thanks for letting me in here today. 
[03:17:30]  All right.  Sure.  Ron and Fez, noon to three.  There you go.  You should make somebody else smell that, by the way.  Yeah.  You should fucking rub that in the summer.  Yeah, put that in the candy dish down in the lobby.  We need an outro for the bit.  See, right now it would be nice to go back to announcer voice guy.  Yeah.  When Anthony guessed it, that made him try to pull that.  Oh, God.  And the wrapper was still on, so you know that caused some damage coming out.  Oh, paper cuts.  And now he's walking around in victory with the lollipop up in the air, with his gut hanging 
[03:18:00]  out and his awful box was still on.  And he's shoving it in people's faces.  You're always around for the banner shows, Daryl, Lou.  Listen, it's completely entertaining.  Yeah.  Sam, you got that for YouTube or something?  There you go.  Private collection.  Dick Dick will have a reality show.  Millionaire.  I'll be reading for fucking Laura and Oda.  I'm going to take a look at Dick Wolf's headlump. 
[03:18:30]  Fucking trying to impress a dude with a fucking goiter in his eye.  And he's like, nice one, Nick.  We'll talk to you soon.  Yeah, thanks.  Can I put a lollipop up my ass?  Maybe that'll help.  Can I get validated, please?  Yeah, I can do a Columbo for you.  We will wrap up this mess next.  All right.  This is radio and it's most fascinating.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the worst radio I've ever heard. 
[03:19:00]  On and on and on and on and on.  It's fucking boring.  It's hard to be a good listener in general, but to try to listen to this,  you better off jerking him up into a napkin and crying yourself to sleep.  Trust me, kid.  All right.  Getting ready for line of the day.  E-Rock's supposed to run in some audio of Rush talking about cartoons,  all the cartoons he's seen over the years.  What? 
[03:19:30]  Claiming that he never saw Curious George.  Here comes E-Rock once again.  E to the rock.  Look at him.  That's running.  That was apology rambles about cartoons he used to watch.  Okay.  All right.  Let's see.  He's just trying to cover his ass.  Because he laughed at the fact that someone said that Obama looks like Curious George.  Right.  And then he's claiming he never saw Curious George.  He was just laughing.  Rush line.  I need to apologize to both Senator Obama and to Senator McCain. 
[03:20:00]  We had a caller, the last caller of the hour.  Your name was Tammy.  Is that right?  What we were talking about McCain or Hillary and Obama and that race with her, right?  Obama, Obama's qualifications.  And she told me what her 12-year-old's, that right, 12-year-old's reaction to Obama was.  That he, little 12-year-old thought Obama looked like Curious George and I chuckled.  And we went to a break.  I've never heard of Curious George. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, he's thinking I'm his whole way, man.  I never heard of Curious George.  I, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, how am I gonna, how am I gonna get myself out of this one?  I thought Curious George was half a fag.  Yeah.  Then we went to a break.  I've never heard of Curious George.  Um, only now have staffers sent me little pictures of Curious George.  I bet.  Never heard of Curious George.  You know what, the camera was a kid.  Now that I've seen it, I realize that he's a monkey, and I'm not sure what the big deal was, because that's clear. 
[03:21:00]  Curious George.  Never heard of Curious George.  Folks, when I was a kid, the last cartoon I ever watched was Popeye.  No, I didn't watch Mighty Mouse.  I never watched Mighty Mouse.  This is the whole point.  I watched, one of the cartoons I watched, I watched Yogi Bear, I watched The Flintstones, The Wacky Racers, which was hilarious.  Was it?  Wow, what a, he's going to have lost his mind.  That's really sad.  I thought that in the last segment that he was going like, oh, I'm sure this is what you want to hear, that I never heard of Curious George. 
[03:21:30]  It's sad that that's what it's come to.  But he's actually trying to say, I never heard of Curious George.  You can't do a radio show as long as he has and not know who Curious George is.  Yeah.  That's just ridiculous.  He's lying.  It was also a big, when that movie came out, you couldn't get away from the side of a bus that said Curious George.  Didn't they just remake it recently, too?  Yeah, they just did it.  And why were you laughing?  I wrote on it for a month.  So basically, he's never been to a movie website, is what he's saying.  No, he's never, you know. 
[03:22:00]  I gotta be honest, I didn't know who it was myself.  I don't know.  That's how much...  I thought all those pictures were of Barack Obama.  I had no idea.  I didn't know that there even was.  That's how much I like they are.  Hillary Clinton is tied with Curious George in Texas.  I watched a cartoon based on the movie Birth of a Nation.  It was a lot of fun.  I don't know about this Curious George character.  I had no idea Curious George was a monkey.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  No one's a fucking liar.  The Jetsons, I didn't like the Jetsons. 
[03:22:30]  I didn't like the Jetsons.  I didn't like...  This is the whole point.  The great people just said,  Curious George, I liked.  But you know why there were no black people in the Jetsons?  Well, the future looks bright, doesn't it?  I don't know how the joke goes.  I don't care.  I didn't like...  This is the whole point.  I didn't read comic books.  I did not...  I didn't.  They were children's books.  I did not watch cartoons.  What did you do?  Well, I did like Elkabong.  Quick draw McGraw and that sort of thing.  I did not watch cartoons.  He keeps naming so many things that shows that he is completely taken in popular culture. 
[03:23:00]  I know Elkabong.  I know.  He's mentioned everything but Queer.  Yeah.  He's...  Other H.A.  Ray not books.  I'm getting a fine fact.  I liked...  I liked...  The giraffe.  There was a giraffe.  I'm getting a fine fact from Than.  There have been 58 Curious George books since 1941.  58.  It's pretty much one a year for the last 60 years.  I don't know Curious George.  I would concentrate on the man in the yellow hat.  I never knew he had a house partner. 
[03:23:30]  I don't know this Curious George.  I don't know what he does.  That's right.  Nope.  Did...  Did not...  Never read Batman.  Never read Superman.  Never read Flash.  We get it.  Read comic books.  Come on, dorks.  It's not a comic book.  It's a huge children's book.  What a nerd.  And it's a doll.  And it's a movie with Will Ferrell's voice that came out about two years ago.  Tops.  Is it?  Yes.  There was one town...  There was a comic...  My mother was going to have to be gone, so she made me heat up a Swanson's fried chicken 
[03:24:00]  TV dinner.  And I wanted to read something while I was eating it.  It was some cartoon.  I bet you didn't have one there, did you, fatso?  My mother was going out of town, so she put me in bed with my grandmother and her friend  like Midnight Cowboy.  Yes.  And they gave me a dollar and said, go to the movies, lover.  She bakes TV dinners like the average person bakes cookies.  Why are they bringing up fried chicken?  That was kind of stupid.  Yeah, a little racist.  That was weird.  Just a whole tray of TV dinners. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, I didn't know Swanson's made chitlins.  I never had fried chicken growing up, or watermelon.  I used to...  We had the Swanson's jowls.  I was eating some cartoon.  I can't even say what the comic book was.  But I have no idea who this mighty, or this curious George guy was.  Oh, my goodness.  God, shut up.  Jesus, what an asshole.  I wish to apologize to both Senator Obama and Senator McCain.  It was not my intent to bring dishonor and guttural utterances into this campaign. 
[03:25:00]  It happened.  I laughed about it.  It was a 12-year-old kid's reaction to Obama.  It was told by his mother.  I was laughing because I was being polite, and I'd never heard a curious George.  I still don't know what the deal is.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, but this is the bullshit of it, you fucking...  He's like Maxwell.  Oh, my God, are you going?  He's a liar, because he...  That's then.  He not only laughed, he went, huh, huh, huh, don't make me laugh. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, don't make me laugh.  Like, I can't laugh at that.  Right, it was obvious that he knew that there was something there that he wasn't supposed to laugh at.  That he shouldn't be laughing.  It was a cautious, uh-huh, okay, don't...  Why would he say, don't make me laugh?  Don't make me laugh at that, right.  I would give another reason for him to say that.  If he didn't know.  That if he didn't know what curious George was...  Exactly, I didn't even think of that.  Why did he go, huh, okay, don't make me laugh, I can't, we gotta get off the air.  Very good counselor.  Very good.  But that's what this...  People are actually able to deny shit that's on fucking tape of themselves. 
[03:26:00]  This is like friggin' Stalinism.  I only laughed because I was being polite.  Really?  Then why did you mention it?  You can't even say things, you can't laugh at, you have to explain why.  No one called him out on anything.  This is fucking Soviet Union circa 1950.  Yeah.  He started explainership before anyone said anything.  It's fucking horrible.  Can you...  I'd love to hear the laughing again.  Sure.  Yeah, the original laughing.  The original laugh.  Let me just find out.  Hold on, let's get to the end of this.  And just hear how he's going, uh-huh.  But I have no clue what curious George does.  I don't know. 
[03:26:30]  And Dawn stunned me.  Well, you know, curious George was around when you were growing up.  Well, first I have heard...  In fact, I can tell you, I have never seen a cartoon starring a monkey.  McGillagorilla?  Yeah, liar.  Are you a liar?  I can't even murder monkeys.  McGillagorilla is a gorilla, which though it is one of the primates, one of the great apes,  it is different than a chimpanzee, which I believe is what curious George is.  I thought King Kong was a guy with a crown. 
[03:27:00]  Fucking con.  Shut up.  He's afraid to make any reference to anything.  Oh my, what a fraud.  I know Davey Jones was in a band.  I don't know what the name was.  I never heard of it.  Mickey Dolenz.  He's just a great monkey.  I was somebody's uncle.  I don't remember who.  Unless there was one on the Jetson, or on the Flintstones.  He has a barrel of something.  Sorry, I'm a planet of the something.  Unless there was one with Charlton Heston, planet of, uh, what was it? 
[03:27:30]  Something.  That's right.  Oh my God, he mentions the Flintstones.  Yeah, he mentions if there was any monkeys in the Flintstones.  Which brings up the most racist cartoon joke ever.  Exactly.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, I think he's speaking in code.  You know why there weren't any black people on the Flintstones?  The Flintstones, well.  He's not speaking in code.  What?  I know.  He's a dope.  Fucking fat junkie cunt.  Unless there was one on the Jetson, or on the Flintstones.  But I think those were dinosaurs and alligators.  Dinosaurs and alligators. 
[03:28:00]  What?  He's insane.  He's panicking.  Who do you think he used to fucking wash the dishes and go, it's a living?  You know, a fucking monkey did something in that.  I know it.  How about grape ape?  You never heard of grape ape?  Yeah, exactly.  Like a gorilla?  You know, Obama can talk about the future.  Here we go.  And the Clintons can talk about the past.  I stand up for the right now.  I'm big on the right now.  Somebody's got to be for right now, and that's me.  Hey, listen.  My 12-year-old daughter, she heard a statement last week was,  Who cares what the guy's middle name is? 
[03:28:30]  He looks like Curious George.  Well, your daughter's a racist.  Listen, I can't laugh.  The point that we're going to make to you is,  you're going to have to be very careful how you try to disagree.  You don't have to disagree.  He laughs and then goes, I can't laugh.  I can't laugh.  The laugh itself is like,  I can't laugh.  I can't laugh.  Why would you say I can't laugh?  Why would he say that?  Why can't you laugh?  Unless you're on a pill that every time,  like for your heart,  but every time you laugh,  your asshole falls out like a fucking dog's pussy.  Pick it up like it's your keys.  Yeah.  It's slinkies out of your pants. 
[03:29:00]  E-Rock just handed in something else.  What's this now?  More cartoon babble?  He says Hillary probably liked the comment,  and then he had to go and apologize to Hillary for saying that.  Oh my God.  This is what happens.  This is what fucking happens when you get a woman and a fucking,  this is the,  fuck.  This is,  fuck.  You understand?  This is what white males have been going through the last 50 years.  Yeah.  You can't say shit.  No.  E-Rock's smiling,  and then what?  And then he goes on another cartoon.  Fucking insanity.  Another cartoon rant, 
[03:29:30]  claiming he's never seen Snoopy,  but then describes every character in Charlie Brown's world,  but has never seen Snoopy.  And then he goes,  was Snoopy in the newspapers?  Was he a comic book?  I don't know.  And he just keeps going.  I think Rush is losing his mind.  He really is.  What the fuck?  I always thought he sucked,  and he was a cornball,  but now he really is just becoming irrelevant.  So at any rate,  we have fired the caller,  Tammy.  We're not going to put up with this on this program,  ladies.  That's a little sarcastic. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah,  see that sarcasm right there.  That's part of me that thinks that he's doing this to make his listeners laugh.  Like he's going way over the top,  saying,  I could never have heard of me,  and I watched the Flintstones.  Maybe he's playing.  I mean,  I don't know if there are any mothers.  He's on a Flintstone.  Yeah,  but you don't think he just might be fucking worried about losing his fucking empire?  But he's doing both.  He's getting to do both. </pre>
