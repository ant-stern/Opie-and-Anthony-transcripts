<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a discussion about the upcoming Oscars, predicting low ratings due to a lack of popular films and Hugh Jackman's hosting.  This segued into a scathing critique of the Tyler Perry *Madea* movies, punctuated by played clips highlighting their perceived flaws.  The show then pivoted to the death of Verne Gagne, a professional wrestler with Alzheimer's and dementia, who allegedly killed a fellow nursing home resident. This sparked a conversation about professional wrestling, its staged nature, and the collaborative aspects of finishing moves.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to the recent killing of a Philadelphia police officer.  The hosts expressed outrage at the lack of media attention compared to other less significant events, like a newspaper cartoon controversy.  Numerous callers, including friends of the deceased officer and Philadelphia residents, shared their anger and frustration using highly offensive language.  The conversation delved into the suspect's identity, racial aspects of the situation, insufficient police resources, and a perceived lack of respect for law enforcement.  Callers also discussed specific details of several officer deaths over the past few years, and the insensitive trivia contest held by a local radio show on the day of an officer's funeral. This section also briefly touched upon the economic crisis, bank bailouts, inflated housing prices (as described by a caller who overpaid for his house), and the assault of Rihanna by Chris Brown (with images shown from TMZ).  A brief, joking nod to Black History Month featured a fictional character from *Major League*.

The show then featured an in-studio guest, Sam Robertson, for a preview and critique of the Osbourne's variety show, including clips of Ozzy Osbourne's antics.  This segment also included a lengthy discussion about "bromances," reality TV (specifically, `Rock of Love Bus`),  and workplace rumors about potential job losses and restructuring at the radio station.  Humorous interludes included a discussion of "The Wonder Boner" (a fish deboning tool), and several "FU Line" messages.  Other brief discussions touched upon 9/11 conspiracy theories, Kurt Cobain's death, and misspellings on the Guitar Hero game cover.

A lengthy interview with a 21-year-old NYU intern, Jill, followed.  The conversation began with jokes about their former boss, Bruce Mitman, and quickly transitioned into explicit discussions about Jill's sex life, including detailed descriptions of sexual acts and preferences, and a humorous discussion about penis size statistics.  The segment also included a detailed, fictional sexual fantasy recounted by a male intern, David, involving two women, prompting further explicit conversation.

The show concluded with a caller, David, providing a lengthy, graphic, and detailed account of a sexual fantasy involving two women.  This was followed by another caller, Daniel, offering a much shorter and more direct account. The segment spontaneously transitioned into a seemingly impromptu show hosted by David and another caller, "Bobo," with further off-color and rambling conversations with other callers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  it's the opie and anthony show opie and anthony radio shop job opie and anthony  lose that you're done you might as well blow your brains out  but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the road  ah friday yeah that does seem to be a something that kind of gets perks you up a little bit 
[00:00:30]  doesn't it effing friday  nice nice nice  oscars this weekend yes they're saying no one cares though  people are saying it's going to be the lowest rated oscars ever because the movies are a little too  weird well the movies are a little uh weird a little off no big uh mainstream hits i think 
[00:01:00]  and then um i guess hugh jackman hugh jackman is hosting it  oh really the first non-comedian to be hosting since 1985  uh-oh and he says they're going to be doing a few things differently  uh-oh don't they say that every year yeah i know this year we're going to try some  different things something a little different but uh he has hosted the 
[00:01:30]  the uh tony awards which is uh you know  oh you know how uh hosting the tony disease you just got to make a few girls like how are my girls  doing out there  just great you  how are my sisters  wonderful hugh thank you very much  i'm applying that they're gay  yeah we got that  that's where i was going  jack nicholson saying he's not going to the oscars 
[00:02:00]  why that's a big big sign right there that uh you know it's going to be a bust  i hope a comic does an imitation of him  turns around i'm not going to the oscars  mac friggin nicholson impression  how come they're not getting a comic is it because they can't tape being teased  is it because those little fags can't tape being made fun of is that what it is  i think it's because every year when they get a comic unless it's uh you know whoopee or  it gets a little too edgy uh it gets crazy and then people complain that it wasn't funny 
[00:02:30]  not funny well  not funny do the bit  yeah  and uh it just gets a little a little crazy  well good for them  you know what no it should have happened  medea  should have released the movie  three or four months ago and then  it would be the rage at the oscars this year  dude i  are you gonna go see medea this weekend jimmy  i don't know what medea is oh my god where have you been you don't know what medea is 
[00:03:00]  i would not  go to see a medea movie  come on  if i was paid to go see it  i would not go see it  how many medea movies have there been  i couldn't tell you too many  i would say  uh and and  that is where i i was talking about our cultures being a little different  you don't see many white people going to medea movies i don't think  i think they do better in the urban areas  it looks like 
[00:03:30]  the most unfunny  hack  uh black  uh uh entertainment  i i just don't  i don't get it  medea goes to jail  oh  come on  this is like earnest  these are like earnest movies  yeah it's like the new earnest  earnest goes to camp  earnest goes to jail  medea goes to jail is the latest one  it is  it's the new earnest  it's gonna  it's gonna do gangbusters  and and i saw i saw a clip of the trailer during some show i was watching and um 
[00:04:00]  there was medea  tyler perry dressed as his beloved character medea  in jail  and there was this uh white chick  as the head of the prison you know  kind of worked her way up i guess  to be a head of the prison  and she's trying to tell medea what to do  uh oh  you know  oh yeah  oh yeah  uh oh  see jimmy knows  he got it  he got it  he's laughing 
[00:04:30]  and uh  medea sets her straight  yeah  little white girl  sets her straight  and medea i guess becomes you know  the head muckety muck  of the jernt  well  yeah  i think uh  you know we should keep an open mind  and we should go see the medea movie  open mind  and see what happens  yeah open your mind  pour your brains out  and then go see the medea movie  medea  never  no  never  so people are sort of talking about the oscars 
[00:05:00]  um  we got two great wrestling stories today  yeah a couple of those  that's pretty good  we got  we could start with verne  uh  how do you say his last name again  gagne  remember verne gagne  i uh  for the older people out there  when i saw the move  uh the uh  news story  and i clicked on  and i was hoping it was going to be somebody i knew  but um no  the name didn't ring a bell for me  verne gagne  wrestled with uh  hulk maybe a little bit 
[00:05:30]  never  they never crossed paths  probably not  more  more bruno san martino probably  hold on  oh there you are  resident expert  yes  verne gagne started the awa  and that's where hulk hogan  got his start  so there was sort of a connection there  but not really  oh yeah  thanks for helping me out  i appreciate it  he was  what year did he actually uh  was he in the squared circle  wow  long long time ago  he was like  andre the giant  60s  70s and 60s  he might have made it  into the 70s  that was when people thought it was real 
[00:06:00]  it is  in front of their black and white tv  going come on  come on  why didn't the ref see it  bunch of adults  that used to be very frustrating  oh actually thinking it was real  before you knew it was all phony crap  what are you talking about  it used to be  very frustrating  i've seen it  and you were always like  well wrestling isn't as  as hot as baseball  hockey  football  basketball  so they're getting the crappy refs  that weren't good enough  for the real sports 
[00:06:30]  yeah  that's how i justified it  but again  that illegal move  oh my god  come on  wrestling is a far more  it needs more training  it's a far more action packed sport  than any of those other things  and so it's harder for a referee  to see every single aspect of the action  it's acrobatics  it's like cirque de soleil for retards  no  that's what wrestling is  it's acrobatics  and they know exactly what moves they're doing  well  they know what they're doing  but their opponent don't know what's coming 
[00:07:00]  you know they're  i know  see they do too  you know your boys are embarrassed  they would never do like a wrestling match  next to a ufc event  what do you mean  they have to look ahead of  ahead of time and go  wait  is there a ufc event in town  because if there is  we got to go somewhere else  because we're going to look stupid  ufc is  i mean  ufc is good and all  but wrestling is  wrestling  see explain this to me then  when uh  someone's doing a finishing move  like uh  the tombstone 
[00:07:30]  yeah  or um  what's uh  what's his name  uh you know  he's got a big finishing move there  where he does that thing with his arms  and then  you mean  john cena  no no  he's married to um  vince's daughter  oh you mean the pedigree  triple h's  triple h's pedigree  now i've never seen a finishing move that takes so much cooperation from the opponent  to wrap his arms around things like why do they actually hold on to like the legs  and and and and help him out 
[00:08:00]  to give him this finishing move  to give him this finishing move  these guys are skilled professionals so they know how to get their opponents in these compromising holes  but the opponent  is actually like holding his legs  and going all right come on drop me on my head  no he's not he's in a dazed state so his arms are a little more loose  loose  they're tightly wound around his legs to like hold him in the proper position so he doesn't hurt himself  only because triple h has put them there intentionally these are trained professional athletes 
[00:08:30]  sam i i hate that you play this role on the show  what are you  shut up  shut up  are you saying that they become more pliant due to their beating  yes  of course  could you just tell us the verne story please  well verne ganya  ganya right  yes  he's now 82 and he has alzheimer's  and dementia  oh boy  ganya ganya  his brain is ganya  office space man 
[00:09:00]  well i like the first track because the news has some good lines about uh forgetting things and having dementia  all right so this is what happened of good old verne  yes  some of you guys might remember this old school wrestler  his name is synonymous with pro wrestling  is it  verne ganya practically invented the flamboyant genre back in the 50s  oh that hurt  but he never forgot his humble minnesota roots  but the 82 year old ganya  is forgetting  i guess he forgot  he never forgot his humble roots 
[00:09:30]  but he you know forgot the fact that he shouldn't be  killing people  that's the thing about wrestlers though  what  they'll kill you  thank you  i like the turn the reporter makes here  yeah  he gets a little serious all of a sudden  the 82 year old ganya  is forgetting  most everything else  he is suffering from alzheimer's related dementia  and for the last few years he's been living at the friendship village home  in bloomington  all right so 
[00:10:00]  that's uh the update so far  right he's got a bit of the alzheimer's  forgetting almost everything  and he's living in a nursing home  right  but then something happened  yeah  i want you to kill someone  it's an alzheimer's match  yeah  an alzheimer's match  this is where on january 26th  ganya allegedly attacked a fellow patient  who also has dementia  throwing 97 year old helmut gutman's the floor 
[00:10:30]  gutman suffered a broken leg and a head injury  he was hospitalized  then released  but re-hospitalized with complications  oops  gutman died four days ago  he killed someone  like a body slam  but because of medical privacy  and confidentiality laws  there's very little detectives  or friendship village can say  but sources close to the investigation  tell fox 9  one thing is already clear  verne ganya was not in control  of his mental faculties 
[00:11:00]  and criminal charges are unlikely  because a man once known  for his powerful sleeper hold  was most likely unaware  his fighting days were long over  alzheimer's had a sleeper hold on him  they should have added that  they should have added that  all kinds of wrestling terms  and everything  oh poor guy  poor old bastard  as they say  but even with alzheimer's  he's still out there  regulating  what is he regulating? 
[00:11:30]  what are you talking about?  the other patients  I'm sure that guy was talking  all kinds of smack  on verne ganya  verne ganya comes in  what do you think  they were actually  like doing mic time  yeah they were  cutting promos on each other  cutting promos on each other  at the alzheimer's clinic  and verne ganya came in  and said okay let's go  let's go sunshine  and slammed him to the floor  put him up in the  texas clover leaf  texas clover leaf  and he shattered like a  graham cracker probably  when he hit the floor  oh hell yeah  broke his leg in half  a little pretzel rod femur  if you're 82 or 97 
[00:12:00]  you have alzheimer's  and you're in the middle  of a wrestling match  that's got a rock in your mind  oh yeah  I mean in your mind  it's got to be  the greatest thing ever  he probably thought  he was back in the ring  oh yeah  the crowd is going wild  he actually saw that  in his head  that's got to be  just amazing  I hope they put him  just back into the  nursing home  and he just keeps doing it  that's it  to everyone  they should have called  911 and had the cops  shoot him  why  because he's like a chimp 
[00:12:30]  he's like a wild chimpanzee  he's a hall of famer  is he really  he's in the  WWE hall of fame  that's wonderful  hope they don't  eject him  because of this  no if anything  they'll put him up  his last victory  he's still winning  he's still  he can't be beat  no apparently not  not even by the old  alzheimer's  no  some 97 year old  wants to step forward  alright  he just takes it  and uses it 
[00:13:00]  not alzheimer's  he's like  screw it  I'm going to  another match  make up my own match  right  kind of the alzheimer's  took those memories  and just threw them  to the floor  smashed them on the back  and broke them  little body slam  of his memories  alright Sam  good job  we're just getting started  it's Friday  phone number  877-212-0&A  we're going to take  a quick break  and continue  Opie and Anthony  it's Opie and Anthony 
[00:13:30]  I'm looking at pictures  of topless broads  smoking cigarettes  down there in NYU  here in New York City  broads  broads  they're alright  they're really good  for topless broads  yeah you know how to  I like how they have  to smoke cigarettes  because they're really  uncomfortable being topless  is that what it is  like  yeah  the cigarettes  are like a little  security blanket  they're all nervous  they're exposed  to the world  man 
[00:14:00]  man  Jimmy  what do we know  on this  they're protesting  about what  Andrea Pizer  from the Post  yeah  usually irritates me  but today on page  five of the Post  what a  just a sarcastic  slap  just the opening  line of this  they're occupying  I don't know exactly  what it is they want  does it have anything  to do with Israel  and Palestine  I just read this  story twice  I still don't know  why they're doing this  they got problems  with NYU  they got problems  with Palestine 
[00:14:30]  they're upset  about the recent  budget cuts  so they're demanding  full disclosure  and there's also  been something  added in there  about scholarships  for people from  Gaza  but everyone's  budgets are being  cut  yeah everyone's  are  scholarships for  people from  Gaza  yeah they're  demanding all the  teacher salaries  be posted  and the operating  budget be posted  so they can  judge it  oh  they just  it's cute  actually  they're trying  so hard  to be something  but the opening  line is  she's like  they don't make 
[00:15:00]  radicals the way  they used to  some 60 students  all elite  lily white  and whiny  took over the  cafeteria  at New York  University  Kimmel Center  Wednesday  this day is not  a party  but a protest  she's just using  like a really  condescending  start  face slapping  just how they all  show up armed  with their laptops  and their little  cell phones  and they called  their moms  and made  their demands  and their first  big thing  was to make sure  the university  would go and let  them go to the  bathroom  oh really 
[00:15:30]  yeah well they  had to tinkle  during their  protest  yes  so  wait but it  looks like  they're blocking  the doors and  stuff with all  the chairs and  tables  I don't know  what they do  maybe they  move it  but the one  girl was on  the phone  and said  not allowing  us to use  the bathroom  is a human  rights violation  oh then  just  stop your  stupid  protest  of course  and the one  girl said  my parents  are a little  worried  at least  they picked  a good  thing though  just topless  chicks  they're not  in this  article though  are they at 
[00:16:00]  the same  protest even  yeah  a little  later on  outside  about 40  supporters  held a  rally  Kerry  Lyons  20  and Nadia  walked around  topless  in some kind  of protest  over NYU's  failure to  expose where  its money  goes  or something  it was cold  I see  yeah so  I don't know  those guys  they're radical  I mean you know  you can't  you can't  who knows  what's going  on inside  those crazy  minds  they're crazy  they're all  privileged  yeah yeah  just a bunch  of spoiled  little  suburban  white kids  we wouldn't 
[00:16:30]  make a difference  we're special  and we can  change our  world  shut it  you cannot  quiet  go to school  exactly  and go play  some beer pong  somewhere  yeah  what happened  to just  having fun  how would you  know about  the budget  of NYU  I went to  college  that was  the last  thing  I cared  about  what the  budget was  of the  of the  university  we want  full disclosure  of the salaries  of the teachers  do you  everyone's budgets  are being  you know 
[00:17:00]  cut  people are  losing jobs  shut up  well the  number of  students  had dwindled  there was  like 60  during the  big takeover  the number  of students  dwindled  to just  over 20  by nightfall  as kids  went to  class  or went  home  one who  gave up  was  Colin  Dillon  who bounded  out of the  building  and reported  that NYU  would serve  dinner  a lot of  people  have very  particular  diets  he said  food  allergies  or they're  vegetarian  or vegans 
[00:17:30]  bunch of  tools  vegetarians  or vegans  man  god  a generation  of wimps  coming up  behind us  it's terrible  a generation  of wimps  I don't eat  anything with  a family  or a face  is that it  that's how  they justify  eating plants  yes  yes  yes  yeah but  how do we  know  that's what I'm  saying  yeah  you know  plant has a  face  just looks  like a  leaf  how do we  know what  the plants 
[00:18:00]  are thinking  kind of  family  well the  scientists  well yeah  that's how  we look  at things  though  maybe in  the overall  universe  the plants  are very  important  there's no  science behind  what they're  thinking  who knows  they just  think a  salad  doesn't  hurt  eat rocks  and dirt  if you  want to  be sure  there you  go  have a  rock  sandwich  get your  vitamins  and minerals  yeah but  when you eat  the dirt  you're eating  little microorganisms  yeah  maybe those  are very  important  maybe they're  the most  important thing  in the  universe  we like  to think  we are  there's 
[00:18:30]  living  I doubt  we are  living  cells inside  vegetables  who's to  say  it's our  take on  things  maybe someone  else's take  on things  it's all  about the  plants  they want the  forest saved  you can't  chop down  trees for  paper or  anything  plants are  okay to  eat  animals not  okay  it is very  selective  we're saving  we're saving  a lot of  trees  lately  jimmy  because  you know  we're all  digital now  we don't have  to print up  every single  thing  that's true  we do  but  so we don't  chop as many  trees down  as we used  to  I didn't think 
[00:19:00]  of that  yeah  you should see  how many  government  organizations  still use  tons of  paper  tons of  paper  but  have you ever  been out  paper  well people  don't understand  that when  you're out  west and  you see all  the forest  being knocked  down for  paper and  what not  they plant  little trees  right behind  it  you see a  whole  mountainside  destroyed  the trees  are completely  gone  and you go  around the  corner  and then  it's a  whole  mountainside  of tiny  little  trees  that will  be growing  for the next 
[00:19:30]  whatever  20-30 years  you see what  they've been  doing with  strip mines  when they do  strip mining  where they  just take  these giant  holes in  the ground  that are  built like  in levels  so they can  get the  vehicles down  to the bottom  and stuff  they've been  filling these  things in  and reclaiming  the environment  they call it  and a company  goes in there  and fills it  up  puts grass  over the top  of it  and you never  know a mine  was there  right  so we're 
[00:20:00]  doing things  that are  you know  supposed to  be good  for the  environment  and stuff  but it's  just constant  just constant  beginning  NYU students  standoff  oh that's  good  I like watching  whoever that  cop was  with that  nightstick  I'm all  for it  nah he was  pummeling  people  he wasn't  pummeling  nobody  what was he  hitting the  just the  barricade  he was  just showing  that he means  business  stay where you  are or this  will be your  head  who's next  that's all  well and good  it's nice that  the topless girls  were doing their 
[00:20:30]  thing yesterday  it does get  attention the  topless girls  we've noticed  that over  years  I've read the  article  it made me  read the article  I don't know  what they're  protesting  maybe one of  these students  could call up  our show  yes sir  I have no  idea  but in the  meantime  we got  this  I mean  we started  the show  talking about  this  and now  I mean  for everyone's  pleasure  pleasure  we are all  struggling to be  our best  can I have some  me time please  did I ever ask you  for some me time  what the hell is me time  my dear you have

[00:21:30]  if I had to  if I had to  sit in a theater  and watch a movie  and the only  choices were  Pink Panther 2  or any  Medea movie  I would have  to go to  Pink Panther 2  I would have  to  and hate it  but I would  hate it less  why  you get more laughs  out of the  Medea the writing  would probably be  less politically  correct  would it be  oh yeah  would it be  or would it  just be another  sassy black woman 
[00:22:00]  made out of  a white  black man  and doing  every stereotypical  stupid  I'm a  oh don't  mess with  Medea  oh she  crazy  I mean  I'm not  happy at  the choices  but I'm  with Jimmy  original character  original character  what  this Tyler Perry  made up  Medea  well he didn't  steal from a  dead guy  what  he made up  a character  called Medea  I'm not saying  that  dig up  Flip Wilson

[00:26:30]  crap  it's a  wet bag  of it  it is  a  sopping  wet  I'm only  saying that  compared to  what Steve  Martin is  doing  I will  still  take  this  even  though  this  is  crap  I'll  take  it  over  Steve  Martin's  movie  I'm  with you  I got  a gunshot  in this  one  I got  yeah  well  hopefully  there's  one  in  Big  Panther  aimed right at  Steve  Martin's  head  I'm  just  going to  play  the  race  card  on  this  one  they're  equally  as  crappy  but  because  I'm  playing  the  race  card  I'll  go see 
[00:27:00]  the  white  movie  of  course  pretty  much  it  I  could  play  the  race  card  why not  you have  an ace  in the hole  do you  that's  right  a diamond  a club  or a heart  I didn't get  less and less  this is  beautiful  one more  clip  from  Madea  goes to  jail  thank god  you got  another  good  you saw  me get  ready to  take this  spot  I took  it  oh my god  look at  your car  it's a little 
[00:27:30]  road rage  incident  right  cool  little  urban music  behind  everything  you can't  even hear  what stupid  M  Mott  the  D  what's wrong  with urban  music  yeah  it's too  loud  I'm saying  you can't  hear  what  Mott  the  DEA  is even  saying  how do  you not  like that  there was  a road  rage  incident  and a  gunshot  in that  movie  so far  because  it  wasn't  me  on the  road  let's 
[00:28:00]  go to  Malik  in  Asbury  Park  in front  of me  Malik  how are you  Malik  hey yo  Ant man  you a  hypocrite  man  you  ain't  gonna  go see  no  Madea  movie  but  when  Michael  Miles  is up  there  you  was  giving  a  mad  praise  for  all  his  Austin  Power  movies  and  I  do  believe  he  had  a  sassy  Beyonce  in his  movie  that  was  praise  for those  well  let me  tell you  that  was  part  of  the  movie  I'm  fine  with  a  sassy  black  woman 
[00:28:30]  being  thrown  in  so  they  could  bring  in  some  of  the  urban  audience  because  that's  all  that's  for  by the  way  but  it  wasn't  the  entire  movie  and  it  was  a  parody  of  a  70s  style  black  exploitation  kind  of  woman  that  they  were  doing  in  Austin  Powers  even  though  the  movies  he  based  those  movies  on  that  character  that's  a  fictional  character  it's all  about  stereotypical  depictions  in his  movies 
[00:29:00]  you know  what I'm  saying  you can  still  get  with it  because  it's  like  you  say  Anthony  stereotypes  are  based  on  truth  that  Pink  Panther  oh  my  god  y'all  spit  on  Steve  exactly  I'm  not  I'm  not  saying  this  I'm  not  saying  I  would  watch  that  because  Pink  Panther  and  Steve  Martin  is  so  good  it  goes  to  show  you  how  much  I  will  never  see  this  Tyler  Perry  movie  because  I  think  Pink  Panther  just  stinks  on  ice  and  I 
[00:29:30]  would  see  that  before  I  saw  any  Tyler  Perry  movie  have  you  seen  any  of  these  movies  yeah  I've  seen  the  first  one  Diary  of a  mad  black  woman  I've  seen  the  Broadway  play  and  it  was  pretty  good  and  believe  me  I  am  no  fan  of  Steven  Tyler  at  all  I  don't  back  him  that's  not  my  kind  of  thing  what  Malik  was  the movie  good  though  it 
[00:30:00]  was  funny  I  got  it  it  was  funny  all  right  that  is  part  that  made  me  laugh  I  mean  just  give it  a try  but  you gotta  stop  drinking  that  haterade  juice  man  you gotta  do that  man  haterade  does  have  a big  glass  of  haterade  I  love  my  haterade  believe me  I love  my  haterade  how many  clips  would you  give it  how many  what  how many  clips  would you  give it  if you  want  to rate  how many  you would  lay into  the  screen  during  the  movie  out of  a ten  I  give it  a five  five 
[00:30:30]  clips  I  give it  a ten  and a  half  I  like the  fact that  you wanted  to say  a ten  and an  eleven  you know  we can  settle this  argument  we need  to find  someone  that's  half  white  half  black  go see  both  movies  and  then  give  us  an  honest  opinion  Sam  Obama  because  this  Madea  movie  I  mean  everyone's  calling  it's  not  made  for  whitey  they're  all  saying  it's  not  made  for  whitey  well  I  thought  we  were  one  people  you  had  an  open  your  mind  it was  like  Anthony  said  everybody 
[00:31:00]  know  what  black  stereotypes  are  and  black  people  know  what  white  stereotypes  are  white  people  know  what  black  stereotypes  are  believe  me  you  should  watch  this  movie  you  can  go in  there  and  really  open  your  mind  and watch  this  movie  like  I  said  I  I  don't  understand  this  movie  for  white  people  you  just  don't  understand  open  your  mind  I  like  the  original  Peter  Sellers  and  Benny Hill 
[00:31:30]  and all  them  so  you  just  a  hater  all right  Malik  thank you  sir  we gotta  move on  because  it's  hater  all flavors  but grape  let's go to  Benny in  Philly  Benny  screw you  Benny  when y'all  was there  I forgot  one of  them  I was  there  and I  was doing  one of  y'all  contests  the push  up  contest  and y'all  shoved  my face  in a  duck  in a  what  remember  that  thing  that  y'all  did  in  Philly  I  forgot 
[00:32:00]  what  theater  it  was  exactly  and I  was  doing  a  push  up  I  remember  it was  a live  broadcast  we did  unbelievable  there was  lines outside  the door  and then  they  kicked us  off the  radio  a week  later  because  that's  what  they  do  in  radio  these  jokes  what  is  going  on  with  y'all  losing  all  these  stations  man  well  let's  you know  the haters  will say  one thing  but the  fact is  this  business  is just  collapsing  it's  let's 
[00:32:30]  get  talent  off the  air  and throw  a guy  in there  for  $30,000  a year  to spin  records  and that's  about it  it's all  about  getting the  cheapest  show  possible  and playing  a lot  of records  which I  don't  understand  I would  go the  other way  I would  go  personality  driven  big time  especially  with the  whole world  falling apart  I think  people need  a little  more  than  a marathon  of music  that they  could get  in a million  different places 
[00:33:00]  sorry  well  what I was  trying to  explain  to y'all  is that  I want to  know something  why are all  the cops  being shot  in Philly  you know  what man  I'm one  of them  brothers  that ain't  into that  stuff  and I  really  feel bad  personally  if I was  a cop  I definitely  feel I would  put my  back down  because they  just don't  got no  respect for  cops  black guys  are drinking  haterade  when it  comes to  the police  I'm not  going to  disagree  with them  but the  truth is  now that  it started  it becomes 
[00:33:30]  a trend  so like  now that  you shot  a cop  it's a bad  job  if you  lived through  it anyway  I hate to  say it  but that's  the way  it is  like I  said  that's not  my style  in my life  but I know  these people  who do  stuff like  that  I asked  that because  the last  cop that  got killed  down there  in Philly  was part  of the  Philly  crew  no  yeah  we lost  one of  our boys  24  it was  what  a few  days ago  yeah  I know 
[00:34:00]  the dude  he was  24  25  with a  wife  two months  pregnant  and two  how's the  story go  two cabbies  were fighting  and one  the cab  driver  I think  he was  going to  rob the  cab driver  the cab  driver  said  I'm  going to  call  the cops  and you  said  you  call  the cops  I'm  going to  shoot  you  in the  cop  that's  exactly  what  he said  he goes  if you  call  the cop  cops  I will  shoot  a cop  this is  two  cabbies  arguing  it was  a cabbie  no 
[00:34:30]  it was  somebody  trying to  rob a  cabbie  I believe  right  so the  cabbie  said  I'm  going to  call  the  cops  right  and  then  the  robber  goes  well  you  call  the  cops  I'm  going to  shoot  the  cop  and  it was  really  a  mess  up  trend  down  here  I don't  know  if  it's  a dude  from the  Philly  crew  he shows  up  he's  a young  police  guy  down  there  in  Philly  and  he's  dead  so  the  cop  the  guy  robbing  first of  the guy  robbing  the  cabbie  did he  shoot  the  cabbie  as well  or  did he  shoot  the  cop  and  did he  get  shot  I  didn't  hear  nothing 
[00:35:00]  about  the  cabbie  getting  shot  so  I'm  really  I'm  kind  of  even  wondering  if  he  was  robbing  the  cabbie  I  think  he's  gotten  a  gun  blazing  that's  how  the  cops  should  show  up  to  these  calls  of  course  guns  blazing  it was  a  relatively  they need  to have  an AK  on their  head  because  I 
[00:35:30]  family  actually  works  for a  living  and  some  thug  25  years  old  filthy  thugs  gotta  put a  bullet  in  them  what  the  police  ought  to  just  go  on  a  rampage  screw  the  camera  phones  screw  any  videos  you  see  put  it  on  TV  put  the  family  of  this  guy  mourning  at  his  funeral  instead  of  putting  videos  of  cops  slamming  these  bastards  up  outside  their  head  with  billy  clubs  because 
[00:36:00]  that's  what  they  should  be  doing  disgusted  remember  the guy  they were  chasing  a video  in  Philly  and  there  were  like  20  cops  that  stomped  these  three  guys  after  the  cop  got  shot  and  killed  you  remember  that  well  that's  kind of  how  they  feel  about  it  let me  tell you  another  thing  the cops  are so  petrified  of going  to jail  these  days  for  just  being  a  cop  some  guy  pulls  a  gun  on  him  and  the  cop  shoots  him  all  of  sudden  there's  activists  all over  the  goddamn  place  and  the  cop  is  now  wondering  if  he's 
[00:36:30]  going  to jail  that's  why  they  second  guess  and  that  second  guessing  is costing  them their lives  guns blazing  go in  go into that  call  with your  guns out  and  expecting  the  worst  and  if  you  see  a  flinch  blow  their  head  off  because  they're  not  going  to  become  anything  anyway  thugs  goddamn  thugs  here's  the  problem  it's  bad  everywhere  but  Philly  it's  an  epidemic  this  is  like  the  sixth  cop  in  the  last  what  couple  years  in  the 
[00:37:00]  last  two  years  how's  Al Sharpton  is he  on his  way  over  there  or  is  he  he's  complaining  about  a  goddamn  drawing  in  a  newspaper  how  about  you  go  there  and  visit  the  family  of  this  dead  white  officer  by the  way  white  officer  what  color  was  the  perp  I  want  to  know  what  color  was  the  perp  we  got  a  description  was  the  paper  or  anyone  brave  enough  to  put  a  description  of  the  guy  in  or  did  they  just  say  he  was 
[00:37:30]  a  male  approximately  19  to  50  how  about  you  narrow  it  down  to  10%  of  the  population  and  say  perhaps  he's  white  or  black  what  color  was  he  I  want  to  know  the  race  I  want  to  say  it's  a  hate  crime  yeah  son  of a  bitch  stupid  media  stupid  activist  get  out  Sharpton  with  the  outrage  that  there's  no  there's  no  guidance  in  the  black 
[00:38:00]  community  and  no  one  raised  these  young  men  to  be  citizens  that  can  assimilate  to  society  get  decent  jobs  and  not  thug  around  give  me  a  break  is  that  whitey's  fault  too  I'm  sick  of  it  we're  trying  to  find  out  who  the  purpose  Benny  shut  up  for  a  second  will  you  get  a  hold  of  yourself  and  you  fall  apart  Jesus  Benny  Schwarzenegger  should  put  a  drill  through  the  side  of 
[00:38:30]  I  didn't  know  how  to  bring  this  up  but  he  is  part  of  the  Philly  crew  I  didn't  know  him  that  well  but  I'm  a  fan  of  the  show  the  people  I  do  hang  out  with  know  him  really  well  and  he  leaves  behind  a  wife  who's  two  months  pregnant  and  what  I  got  to  do  is  I  got  to  put  a  benefit  together  for  this  family  I  have  to  go  down  good  for  them 
[00:39:00]  but  you  know  what  this  one  affects  me  personally  and  I'll  admit  you  get  involved  when it  affects  you  personally  good  for  them  I  don't  like  those  guys  but  if  they're  doing  that  that's  pretty  good  but  we're  going to  set up  our  own  benefit  and  figure  something  out  I  up  Benny  likes  hearing  himself  talk  please  shut 
[00:39:30]  up  for  a  second  he's  on hold  what  do  you  got  Danny  did  you  have  something  well  I  think  I  found  the  name  of  the  suspect  you  guys  would  like  it  the  suspect  identified  by  police  as  Rashid  Scruggs  alright  thank  you  and  don't  tell  me  you  can't  tell  by  a  name  you  can't  shut  up  alright  another  black  guy  kills  a  white  cop  where's  the  outrage  there's 
[00:40:00]  no  outrage  wake  up  whitey  why don't  you  get  out  on  the  streets  and  start  protesting  say  something  open  your  yap  there's  a  huge  problem  in  Philadelphia  what  the  why  isn't  anybody  doing  anything  there's  cops  being  gunned  down  by  these  thugs  and  city  officials  and  police  brass  are  afraid  to do  anything  about  it  because  they'll  be  called  racists  they'll  have  activists  all over  their  ass  if  they  start  shaking  down  these 
[00:40:30]  these  goddamn  thugs  and  believe me  I'd  rather use  different  words  because  if  any  word  qualifies  for  this  son  of a  bitch  it's  that  word  six  cops  in  the  last  two  years  in  Philly  alone  that's  insane  tired  of  it  and  I  hear  the  mayor's  like  he's  a bit  on  the  weirdo  side  that  city's  a hunk  of  crap  let's  go to  Gary  Philly  Philly  go  screw  Philly  do  something  at least  our city  knows  they put  cops  that'll  crack  some  skulls  out  on the  street  well  the  cops 
[00:41:00]  you should  see  what the  cops  do  when they  get into  these  situations  well  you know  what  they do  a little  street  justice  trust me  this  young  officer  should  have  had  his  gun  out  and  known  that  there  was  going  to be  shenanigans  happening  but  what  you  pull  your  gun  out  now  you  got  a  report  of  why  you  pulled  it  out  oh  because  I saw  a young  black  man  I felt  in danger  no you  can't have  that because  that's  racist  that's  profiling  shut up  put his  face  in the  ground  put your  knee  to his  neck  put his  gun  to his  head  honestly 
[00:41:30]  it wasn't  that type  of call  I mean  the officer  at the time  didn't know  that this  guy said  yeah call  the cop  I'll shoot  him  he had no  I'm sure  they were  doing  what  you know  they're  intimidated  by the  climate  that we  live in  today  police  are  scared  crapless  that they  are going  to be  thrown  not only  fired  put in  jail  for doing  their job  that's a  great incentive  to do 
[00:42:00]  your job  knowing that  if you do  it  and you're  making a  split second  decision  that you  could possibly  go to  jail  you have  to bring  up the  judge  that went  into the  35th  district  where  this  officer  put his  belt  on  every  day  and  turned  his  picture  over  when he  was given  trials  as not  to be  partial  to the  state  while he  was  in this  cop's  district  this judge  went and  turned his  picture  over  he put  his filthy  hands  on his  cop's  picture  and turned  it over  inside the 
[00:42:30]  courtroom  inside the  35th  district  this judge  went in  there  and turned  the cop's  memorial  picture  over  in front  of the  police  officers  he put  his hands  on that  cop's  picture  and turned  it over  this is the  guy who's  responsible  for putting  these maggots  on the  street  to assassinate  us  and he went  in there  and turned  that cop's  picture over  that is why  we have  the problem  we have  here  yeah I'm  sure  this thug  left  college  I think  his name's  Craig  Washington  I think  this man  went in  there  and disrespected 
[00:43:00]  every cop  in the city  turned his  picture over  just because  he wanted  to make  the criminal  feel a bit  more comfortable  yeah these  judges  a lot of  these judges  should just  be thrown  off the  bench  absolutely  thrown off  they do  nothing to  help us  I'm only  private security  out here  and I gotta  watch my back  because I might  get assassinated  these cops  go out here  and they know  that they are  targets for  assassination  this call  came over  as a  fight on  the highway  this guy  waited for  the cop  to make  his way  around the  car  before shooting  him through  his jacket  this wasn't 
[00:43:30]  a standoff  this wasn't  a tough guy  going up  against the  system  this was  a scumbag  assassinating  the cop  got assassinated  didn't know  what hit him  like you gotta  be kidding me  you're shooting  over this  I am  disgusted  and the same  ill could judge  is gonna sit  there and see  the sad side  of this  oh his life  his broken  home  the drug  addiction  all kinds  of problems  just give him 
[00:44:00]  an excuse  oh what do we  got here  Stunty  oh that's  the fine  young gentleman  I wonder how  long this ass  his rap sheet  is  he didn't look  like he just  came out of  college  no  he was a  career criminal  exactly  and these judges  just let him  loose  let him loose  until they do  something like  this  there's a  young cop  making his  way  or until  they make  their way  up to the  judge's house  where he  feels nice  and comfortable  away from  the disease  that he puts  on us 
[00:44:30]  that we have  to sit  out here  and fight  and then  the politicians  go and they  try to ban  guns  and take  guns out  of their  hands  of people  to defend  themselves  from these  maggots  leaving us  to be led  to slaughter  that's the  bottom line  alright Gary  I got someone  going to the  actual funeral  right now  I'm just  disgusted  with the  society today  I was going  to bring  this up  today  and here  we go  this guy  he was a  cool dude  and I gotta  do something  I'm putting  together  they're starting  to put together  a benefit  but we're  going to put  it over the  top 
[00:45:00]  and do  something nice  for this  family man  because they're  in a tough  spot now  you can't  look at  you can't  just look  at a man  like Barack  Obama  that made  his way up  to the  presidency  of the  United States  all the  black men  that he's  appointing to  his cabinet  these days  first African  Americans  to reach  such a  pinnacle  of power  in this  country  you can't  look at  that with  a little  pride  and maybe  think  that you  can do  something 
[00:45:30]  with yourself  instead  you gotta  thug it  out  and shoot  cops  what a  waste  of life  just die  just friggin  die  before I  get to  Shane  John  and  Geneseo  I can't  get to  you  but yes  we lost  a cop  in Rochester  as well  a place  I know  very very  well  a 14  year old  kid  shot a  shot a  cop  tired  of it  take care  of your  own  friggin  families  do  something  so these  degenerates  are off  the streets  shot a cop  dead  in Rochester  sick of it 
[00:46:00]  Al Sharpton  look at  I gotta watch  a protest  about a  god damn  comic strip  with  black  activist  tearing up  the New  York  Post  how about  you tear  up a  picture  of this  animal  that shot  this police  officer  that's a  little more  important  Al Sharpton  take care  of your own  family  first  then worry  about  cartoons  there's some  real stuff  going on  in Philly  go down  there  go down  there Al  let's go 
[00:46:30]  to Shane  in Philly  who's on  the way  to the  funeral  actually  Shane  hey  good morning  gentlemen  how are  you Shane  yeah  hater  that's me  been better  been worse  hey listen  real quick  and I don't  know if you  remember  actually  October 31st  2007  I was actually  on the phone  with you  at your house  when my  other brother  from the 35th  district  Trump  Cassidy  was  murdered  alright  okay  I do remember  that  yeah Shane  alright  I really 
[00:47:00]  do  I'm  assigned  down  the  ballistics  lab  I  originally  came out  of the  35th  district  nah  you know  it's  yeah  you guys  are in  the  you guys  are in  the driveway  yeah  it's  become  epidemic  in our  city  I mean  we're  we're  now  on the  eighth  officer  since  2007  and  there's  no signs  of it  really  stopping  wait  we got  this is  the eighth  one  since  2007  unbelievable  why isn't 
[00:47:30]  anyone talking  about this  what is  Mayor  Nutter  doing  and his  name is  Nutter  by the  way  I just  looked  on the  Philly  what is  Mayor  Nutter  doing  about  this  apparently  nothing  I just  went over  all his  recent  press  releases  and the  philly.gov  website  there is  no mention  of this  there is  no mention  of the  violence  against  the  police  acceptable  loss  that way  we can  coddle  the  community  and not  make them  feel bad  about  themselves  and not  stereotype  and not  a profile  just let  cops  that are  trying to  earn a 
[00:48:00]  living  and take  care of  their  families  just let  them keep  dying  instead of  doing  something  instead of  really cracking  down  and racking  some heads  it's actually  been steadily  increasing  for the  past  about  10 years  assaults  against  police  officers  and violence  against  cops  is just  taking  huge  dramatic  leaps  in  Philly  I mean  it's  not an  unusual  thing  to have  a couple  cops  go to  the  hospital  every  night  keeping  in mind  that  we're  not 
[00:48:30]  that  big  of a  city  in the  grand  scheme  of  things  we're  like  number  7 or  8  as far  as big  cities  go  and we're  ranking  number  one  for  the  most  dangerous  city  for  cops  yeah  yeah  isn't  isn't  isn't  that  wonderful  yeah  another  one  now  I look  behind  me  and  another  story  about  the  cartoon  and  Al  Sharpton  protesting  the  cartoon  who  wouldn't  want  to  just  and  believe me  this  isn't  a thread  I'm  not  making  a  threat  but  when  you  see  something  like  this  who  wouldn't  want  to  just  punch  Al  Sharpton  in  the  face 
[00:49:00]  for  being  a  hypocritical  one  sided  race  baiting  phony  that  he  is  opportunistic  boy  did  they  get  that  right  in  the  post  when  they  said  he  is  an  opportunistic  guy  that  just  latches  on  to  these  high  profile  in  the  news  stories  a  comic  about  a  dead  friggin  chimp  has  him  up  in  arms  get  your  fat  ass  to  Philly  and  find  out 
[00:49:30]  why  these  thugs  are  killing  police  officers  there  you  go  you  know  how  much  more  respect  you'd  get  you  stupid  ass  Al  Sharpton  how  much  more  respect  you'd  get  if  you  address  that  problem  that's  a  problem  who's  worse  than  Sharpton  is  the  media  because  that's  what  they  report  they  report  this  ridiculous  post  story  I'll  blame  the  media  too  instead  of  going  down  there  with  a  camera  crew  into  that  area  and  reporting  this  cop 
[00:50:00]  getting  shot  scared  everyone  scared  what  are you  scared  New York  is close  enough  to  Philly  that  they  could  be  doing  a  fine  story  on  this  this  is  a  big  problem  everyone  in Philly  is talking  about this  except for  the media  and except  for the  politicians  giant  problem  there's a  complete  lack  of  discipline  in  this  community  where  these  guys  are  being  brought  up  with  no  supervision  no  nothing  and 
[00:50:30]  not doing  anything  to improve  the  community  so that  nothing  but crime  running  rampant  drugs  and  murder  there's  an ass  down there  that does  a radio  show  that made  fun of  the last  cop  killing  made it  a trivia  part of  a trivia  contest  that's good  I hope  he gets  his door  kicked in  and the  cops are  maybe a  little slow  to answer  his call  Shane  who was  the DJ  a lot  of the  guys  down  there  know  is it 
[00:51:00]  Chio  I think  yeah  I think  Chio  had a  little  fun  with  the  last  cop  that  was  killed  made  a part  of  his  little  morning  trivia  contest  some  ass  that  does  a  radio  show  down  in  Philly  I  didn't  forget  about  that  I've  just  been  waiting  to  bring  all  this  up  Shane  what  could  the  average  Joe  do  that  is  listening  to  our  show  I'm  definitely  throwing  some  kind  of  benefit  together  the  Philly  crew  just  sort  of  working  on  it  but  I'm  going to  try to  put it  over the  top  and get  some  people  involved 
[00:51:30]  but  is there  a website  or something  oh great  of course  your phone  craps out  Shane  your phone  crapped out  just when  we're getting  the good  info  Shane  your phone  is dying  call back  you're going to have  to call back  let's say hi  to Keith  in Philly  Keith  hey yeah  I've been  talking about  the dual  budget right  now  and  somebody  said  I forget  which  news station  but they're  looking to 
[00:52:00]  cut 30%  out of the  police  budget  that's  fantastic  cut 30%  out of the  police  budget  and then I'm  sure in this  stimulus package  there's all  kinds of  money going  to some  low income  crap  that Obama  is putting  into Philly  I guarantee  he's pushing  his recycling  program right  now  yeah  recycling  there you  go  there you  go  I can't  tell you  how many  I can't  tell you  how many  people  that listen  to this  show  part of  the Philly  crew  are cops 
[00:52:30]  I can't  even tell  you  so many  so many  so  just  ridiculous  it's infuriating  yeah let's go to  Geneseo  John  John  turn your radio  down and talk  dummy  hey you hayseed  turn down your radio  who doesn't  who doesn't know  in 2009  who doesn't know  to turn their radio  down  and talk on the phone  it's 2009  you stupid 
[00:53:00]  hayseed  have you ever  heard a radio  program  you're that guy  maybe he got shot  maybe John just  died and fell on the  steps  yeah  John you dope  you just missed  your opportunity  to be on a huge  radio show  now you know  what's gonna happen  in a couple of  minutes or whenever  the delay kicks in  he's gonna start  talking to his radio  no I'm here  he'll be talking  to his radio  like a dolt  oh by the way  I already know  the answer  this was barely  was barely a blip  on the radar  down there  as far as the 
[00:53:30]  newspapers go  Shane  hey sorry guys  you got that info  yeah yeah  first of all  anybody wants to  donate money  to the family fund  they can donate  through the  Philadelphia Police  and Fire Credit Union  you can find them  on the web  and do it right  through the web  or you can  contact the  Philadelphia  FOP  that's the  Fraternal Order  of Police  Lodge 5  Broad and Spring  Garden Streets  they're also  accepting donations  another  a police and fire  bar that we all 
[00:54:00]  love a lot  Smoke Eaters Bar  is also putting  together a couple  of benefits  they're really  stand up folks  and there's also  going to be  a benefit  tonight  after the funeral  at the FOP  at Broad and Spring  Garden  15 bucks a head  food and beer  you know  to try to  raise a couple  of dollars  you know  it's all fine  and well  to do  memorials  and charitable  things  after a cop  is killed 
[00:54:30]  but is anything  being done  to stop it  from happening  nope  in Philadelphia  nope  this place  nope  business as usual  they've been  calling it  Philadelphia  for a while  now  business as usual  bro  it's astounding  to me  that that many  officers can be  killed  in such a  couple of years  and no one's  talking about it  there isn't a  giant outcry  and a search  for the reason  that it's happening  and if I gotta hear 
[00:55:00]  Whitey being blamed  for this  I'm gonna  friggin choke  somebody  when's the last  time you saw  college students  protesting  something like this  like all these  spoiled  oh stop  they don't want  to look like  racists  when's the last  time you saw  them protesting  the killing  of a cop  or the lack  of action  being taken  over cop  that's why  college students  most of you  are just so  putrescent  because you're  such one-sided  little children  why don't you  where's your voice  on something like this  just latch on to  your little  liberal subject  matter  and don't  latch on to 
[00:55:30]  anything that  really matters  and you know  something  I'm seeing a lot  of people that  are texting me  here and  on Pal  talking stuff  and saying  I'd love to  speak out  but you know  all they'll do  is call you a  racist  let them call  you a racist  it doesn't matter  it's a word  it's a word  that unless  unless you really  are truly a racist  it shouldn't  it shouldn't even  matter to the  person that's  calling you one  or to yourself  because the bottom  line is when you  come out against  things like this  you're going to  be called a racist 
[00:56:00]  it's the defense  it's the only  defense  people in  these  crime riddle  communities  have  when you  criticize them  is the  R word  to call you  a racist  so just let  them call you  a racist  but speak  out  you have to  be vocal  whether it's  just a bunch  of people  having a  discussion  about it  no matter  what your  race is  have a  discussion  about what's  happening  and try  to come  up with  a reason 
[00:56:30]  that this  is going  on  I want  a viable  legitimate  reason  why these  thugs are  going around  and just  without emotion  or anything  gunning down  police officers  in cold  blood like  this  I don't know  what the  reason is  May 8th  2006  officers  Skirsky  killed with  a lone  gunman  when a  lone  gunman robbed  Pat's Cafe  in northeast  Philly  September  24  2007 
[00:57:00]  rookie  officer  Richard  the  coach  shot  in the  face  at a  traffic  stop  in west  Philly  October  28  2007  this is  recent  history  ladies and  gentlemen  officer  Sandra  Van  Hinkle  wounded  in the  leg  in a  shootout  in  University  City  October  30  a mere  two  days  later  officer  Mariano  Santiago  shot  in the  shoulder  in  Center  City  October  31  2007  wow  all  within  three  days  these  officer  Chuck  Cassidy  shot  and killed  when he  walked 
[00:57:30]  in on a  robbery  at a  West  Oak Lane  Dunkin Donuts  May 3rd  2008  officer  Steven  Lisbinski  is shot  and killed  while in  pursuit of  a suspect  from a  bank robbery  September  5th  2008  officer  Isabel  Nazario  was killed  when her  police cruiser  was involved  in a crash  with an  SUV  that was  being chased  by  police  September  23rd  2008  two  Philadelphia  highway  patrol  officers  are shot  in  North  Philadelphia  one  of them  officer  Patrick  McDonald  is  killed  at least 
[00:58:00]  one  suspect  is shot  and killed  McDonald  would later  be  promoted  to  sergeant  November  17th  2008  that's  just a  little  while ago  ladies  and  gentlemen  a  Philadelphia  police  officer  Sergeant  Timothy  Simpson  is killed  in a  crash  with a  suspected  drunk  driver  while responding  to a  call  and then  of course  February  13th  Philadelphia  police  officer  John  Pawlowski  was shot  and killed  in the  only  I don't know  how to say  that  only  section  of the  city  so there  you go  so it's  like  out of  the 
[00:58:30]  10  it's  an  epidemic  and I think  one was not  killed  so seven  dead  cops  epidemic  I think  by shooting  and this  Pawlowski  was a hero  just months  or weeks  earlier  he jumped  on a bus  and wrestled  a guy  who had a  gun  in his  pocket  and was  menacing  people  he was  fearless  a young  cop  with a  young wife  two months  pregnant  five months  I think  somebody  actually  I heard  two  five months  pregnant  someone actually  making something  of themselves  making a  career  and for how 
[00:59:00]  corny it  sounds  because I  know a lot  of cops  get into  the line  of work  into the  job  for you  know  money  retirement  things like  that  but  putting their  lives on  the line  they're the  ones at  the end  of the  line  when you  call  911  that show  up  and help  you  and just  the  complete  lack  of  respect  that they  get  in  Philadelphia  the threat  of being  murdered  like that 
[00:59:30]  is  an outrage  but no  one's  talking about  it  let's go to  Dano in  Kentucky  Dano  hey good  morning fellas  hey buddy  hey you  guys were  talking about  was Philly  going to get  any money  for their  law enforcement  and the  answer to  that is  no but  they are  getting a  few million  dollars for  their zoo  for a new  polar bear  exhibit  that's  fantastic  isn't it  nice  how about  at least  it's a  polar bear  of all the 
[01:00:00]  bears it  could have  been  thank god  it's a  polar bear  there you  go  alright  that's more  important right  Chuck in  Philly  Chuck  yeah  hi guys  you guys are  talking about  this and  saying nobody's  talking about  and all that  I'm one of  the paper guys  here  it's on  every newspaper  and cover  every major  newspaper  up here we  mean  why would  you care  what happens  down here 
[01:00:30]  because  you're going  to tell me  in Philadelphia  they're not  covering the  New York  Post race  article  they grab  Good Morning  America  which is a  national show  hold on  can I answer  your question  or not  Good Morning  America  and all  these shows  they grab  a story  like the  New York  Post cartoon  but they  don't grab  the Philadelphia  cops being  gunned down  story  so these  national  shows  are grabbing  these stupid  stories at the  New York  Post cartoon  and not a  story like  this  and your  turn  we assume  that it's  being covered  locally  let me add 
[01:01:00]  this in  too  I'm not  saying no  one's  talking about  it like  the news  isn't  reporting  dead  police  officers  of course  they are  I'm talking  about a  dialogue  between people  where they  get together  and talk  about why  this is  happening  and try  to come up  with a  solution  to prevent  this from  happening  a dialogue  not just  reporting it  in a soundbite  on the news  or a photo  and a story  in the newspaper  I'm talking  about getting  results by  talking about  it amongst 
[01:01:30]  government officials  police officers  and the  community  leaders  that apparently  are doing  nothing  except  concentrating  on cartoons  that's what  I'm talking  about  of course  it's being  reported  ok well  I misunderstood  what you were  talking about  I thought  you might  Jesus Christ  I'm going off  for half an hour  over here  alright Chuck  thank you  make me think  what the hell  I'm doing  alright we gotta  go to break  we're real late  but Brian  a cop in Philly  was in the academy  with the officer  who was just  shot and killed  Brian  good morning guys 
[01:02:00]  it's a sad day  in the city  and John  was a very  good officer  he was  you spoke  about him  disarming  a suspect  on a bus  about three  weeks ago  their suspect  had a ball  proof vest  on  holy  Jesus Christ  so we are  outmanned  we're outgunned  and they are  cutting our budget  we are  they actually  pulled a class  that was in the academy  they stopped  the guys  laid them all off  and we're out  we don't have  any more cops 
[01:02:30]  that they're putting  on the street  yeah  unbelievable  John  John was in  the 6th district  which is mainly  center city  and he volunteered  to go to  the 35th district  which is a lot  busier  and a lot  more dangerous  and the suspect  that shot him  made a statement  to  to the guy  who was fighting  I will kill you  and I will kill  the officer  if you call police  did he kill  the guy too  or did he  obviously not have  the story  if he got reported  did he shoot  the guy  he was fighting  no he did not  he only shot  the officer  the officer's 
[01:03:00]  partner  returned fire  and another  officer that  was throwing up  on the incident  also returned fire  they shot the  suspect I believe  five times  is he dead  no he's not  five shots  and he's still alive  they were both  taken to the  same hospital  and John  died and  the suspect  was taken  into surgery  and I'm sure  the suspect  and his family  will sue  the police  department  guaranteed  he will sue  the police  department  for excessive  use of force  even though  he killed 
[01:03:30]  an officer  he'll say  he didn't  know  he felt  threatened  pulled out  the gun  shot  and then  was shot  five times  oh my god  now I'm  I can't  sleep  I can't  have sex  I can't  walk  and the city  will give  them all  kinds of  money  I'm disgusted  Anthony  you're very  you're correct  the officers  that we all  work with  and they're  on the street  every day  we're scared  we don't  like you said  we are  behind the eight  ball  and we  flinch 
[01:04:00]  we're dead  taking that  little pause  to think about  your job  your livelihood  your own  personal freedom  and that  split second  is life or death  all right  if you want  to donate  to this  this cop's  family  we'll have  the info  on owneday  radio.com  I'll also  I'll commend you  for everything  I'll also tweet  it to my  followers on  Twitter  whatever  and hopefully  next week  I'll have  more details  on the benefit  I'm going to  try to get  going down 
[01:04:30]  there in  Philly  it will be  highly appreciated  and a lot  of the officers  will definitely  come  the Philly  crew  I call them  they're a  tight knit  bunch  and they're  already working  on it  but we're  going to put  it over  the top  so hopefully  I'll have  details next  week  and the  information  will be up  on the  site  just go  there  it's  onaradio.com  will definitely  have it  so  yeah  and then  like I said  I'm at the  cathedral  I have to go  all right  man  make some noise  about this  you know  really  this has to be  brought into  the forefront  here because 
[01:05:00]  it is a huge  problem  all right  Brian  thank you  thanks guys  just really  I mean  wow  and the  sad thing  is it  ain't just  Philly  believe me  oh I know  but it  seems to be  really bad  down there  I mean  because  apparently  they're doing  nothing about it  to try to  solve the  problem  they're cutting  the police  budget  they got  politicians  over there  that don't  see they're  blind  they don't  see it  well we got  one too  but apparently  the mayor  right Jim  look up 
[01:05:30]  Mayor Nutter  the mayor  of Philly  he's a weird  one  he's a weird  one  all right  we got to  take a break  we're really  late  so Opie and  Anthony  stay there  the phone's  just lit  we'll try to  go back to  the phones  in a few  minutes here  Opie and  Anthony  877-212-018  let's go right  back to the  phones  we got  Vernon a  black guy  out of  Philly  Vernon  good morning  how y'all  doing  all right  Vernon  listen I 
[01:06:00]  was just  like I was  just saying  one of the  problems I see  is the fact  that no one  fears the  cops anymore  I remember  there used to  be a time  where you  had fear  about cops  where you  just didn't  go there  like that  back in  the day  in Philly  there used  to be a  commissioner  named  Rizzo  and anybody  that lives  in Philly  that's born  and raised  in Philly  know how  Rizzo  ran his  department  he ran  his department  and he ran  his department  and people  did not even 
[01:06:30]  come near  these cops  but now  you got so  many  piss ass  laws  where cops  are afraid  to do  anything  because the  first thing  happened  as soon as  I get shot  you know  they have to  be questioned  they have to  be you know  grilled and  everything like  that and now  you know  cops are like  second guessing  about you know  doing things  that they have  to do because  they fear that  you know  they're going  to lose their  job or they'll  be and stuff  like that  and I have a lot  of friends  that's cops  and most of  them you know  people are you know  cops that I know  a lot of these guys  are getting like  they're coming off  the streets 
[01:07:00]  and one of the  reasons they're  coming off the  streets is because  you know it's like  they don't have any  they don't have any  more authority  out there  yeah  yeah  the thugs  the thugs  know  the thugs  know  that the  cops are  second guessing  themselves  if you get  especially a  white officer  young white  officer like  the gentleman  that was killed  if he shoots  a black man  there's going  to be  investigation  outrage  uproar 
[01:07:30]  before they  even look  at the  circumstance  it's just  the way  things are  and listen  I'm an  African American  and trust me  you know what I  mean  you know I hate  you know one of  the things that I  hate is the  fact that  and this is  with anything  this is with  anything  every time a  situation comes  on it always  has to be  with race  and like  as you know  when are we  going to just  like grow up  and like move  on with  situations that  everything has 
[01:08:00]  to be about  black and white  because and  it's funny  because  no other  situation  can play out  as much as  black and white  you can have  no offense  you can have  Mexicans  and all different  Jews  and all different  types of  nationalities  move up in  different areas  and stuff like  that and it  can be welcome  you know  Chinese and all  that but  as soon as  like a black  person move  up in a  predominantly  white neighborhood  or a white  person move  down in another  neighborhood  all of a sudden  the big issue  is black and 
[01:08:30]  white  why is America  only built on  black and white  I gotta say  every area  has that  it's like  America  the big two  are black and  white  that's the issue  but again  you go to  the Middle East  it's Jews  and this one  you go to  this one  it's the Indians  and the Pakistanis  it's like  no matter where  you go  there is that  you know  there's that  head butting  so I mean  here black and  white is just  a big one  there's just  this lack  of respect  for police  that a lot  and I'm talking  about the 
[01:09:00]  thuggish  people in the  communities  a lot of  these cops  that work  in the  projects  man  it's just  I don't  know how  they do  it  there is  no respect  for the  cops there  there's no  male  figureheads  like a  father  that is  responsible  and working  that can  teach these  children  that he's  having  with other  women  the rights  and wrongs  so they're  learning from  friggin drug 
[01:09:30]  dealers  how to  you know  how to  live their  lives  and that  entails  you know  the cops  are bad  don't respect  them  kill them  and that's  got to change  that whole  thing's got to  change  right  and don't get  me wrong  because I mean  you know  just like  there's good  people and  bad people  there are  cops that's  good and  bad too  and I'm  not  just  in that  situation  but the  fact of  the matter  is  you know  I mean  like  you know  cops are  they're here to  do a job 
[01:10:00]  or whatever  like I said  I mean  I've had  certain run-ins  with cops  where situations  happen or whatever  and stuff like that  and you know  it is what it is  but you move on  or whatever  but this situation  here  and actually  I think  from reading  statistics  I think  when I was reading  I think  like  the last  two years  cops have just  been getting  gunned down  with no recollection  and nothing like that  and like I said  it goes back  to the fact  that  no one fears 
[01:10:30]  police officers  no more  there's no fear  there's no  no  there's no  justification  because every  criminal is armed  every criminal  because of these  bullshit laws  that cops are  afraid to do  things because  they're worried  about being  pulled in now  exactly  that's what  happened  like  if anybody  thought that  was going to  be a good  idea  to start  persecuting  and literally  prosecuting  these police  officers for  doing their  job  they were  sadly mistaken  because  you know  who picked  up on that 
[01:11:00]  the friggin  perps  and now  they are  running around  with impunity  just killing  cops  and those  are the big  things that  you hear about  you know  how many  cops are  injured  because of  this  you know  how many  cops don't  use deadly  physical force  or hard  restraint  because they're  afraid of  lawsuits  and going  to jail  that got  picked up  people  people know  this  and they use  it to their  advantage  by having  no fear  of the  police  anymore  not only  that 
[01:11:30]  it's like  and then  it's the  situation  of  the easy  access  to the  weapons  that they're  getting  the vest  they're getting  I mean  it's like  it's so much  easy access  to get  you know  like  more firepower  than the cops  can even  carry  and that's  another problem  too  so you know  how you fix  that  you delegate  against  responsible  citizens  that's what  you do  you make  more laws  against  responsible  citizens  because that's  what gets 
[01:12:00]  the guns  off the  street  bunch of  jackass  politicians  that have  their heads  firmly planted  up their  cracks  I hate  it  again  I'm watching  again  I'm watching  a bunch  of people  marching  and protesting  about this  god damn  newspaper  clipping  the cartel  I just wanted  to say one  more thing  and then I'll  hang up  because I  appreciate  you having me  on  one other  thing  like you  said earlier  you're wondering  why this  situation  is not getting  national exposure 
[01:12:30]  and I really  can't answer  that  and I'm  really outraged  the fact  that  you know  like all  week I've  been hearing  about this  damn  tripping  this damn  fucking  lady  excuse my  express  but you  know all  week I've  been hearing  about this  damn  tripping  this lady  and like  Sid  this situation  here when  they start  talking about  these cops  and everything  you know  like the guy  said earlier  they've been  talking about  this like  just blue  in the face  and silly  but I mean  I've been  listening to  CNN  you know  through the  radio  and all that  and not once  did I hear  anything  about this 
[01:13:00]  situation  that's going  on  yeah it  doesn't get  the coverage  that it  should  put their  lives on the  line  because it's  not as  interesting  as a silly  cartoon  that's the  problem  with the  media  today  lives on  the line  and they  get crapped  on  this is much  more important  than a dumb  cartoon  thank you  Vernon  we're going  to go  to  I've got  to go  to Rich  in Philly  we've got  to take  another break  to kind  of catch  up  we're on  a major  tear  here  but  we've got  to play  some lovely  commercials  Rich  what's up  hate breaks  hey how you doing 
[01:13:30]  this is Rich  I'm from Philadelphia  they're actually  they're actually  going to have a walk  on March 1st  on Sunday  at 2pm  in the northeast  part of Philadelphia  it's called  the Flyer State  Zone  and just a rally  for all the  fallen officers  good  you know  I hope  I hope a lot  of people  show up  and I hope  the media  shows up  to this  like they did  with Al Sharpton  ripping up  a comic  in a newspaper  where nobody  was killed  nothing happened 
[01:14:00]  there's Sharpton's  statement on TV  they can't cover  this god damn  monkey story  enough  enough about  the monkey  let's try to get  that dope Al Sharpton  on our show today  yeah  that publicity  whore  try to get Al Sharpton  to call our show  here it is  here it is  I'm working with  community activists  all over the country  to try to  stem the violence  I have a  silence the violence  campaign  I have a  this that  he's been around  for 30 years  this son of a bitch  and nothing

[01:19:30]  the stock market  at a six year low  we're getting close  to like  9-11 numbers  down there  on Wall Street  yeah  pretty close  it's  it's  yeah  it hasn't been  this low  in six years  so since 2003  and  yeah  they're really  digging that  stimulus plan  boy  Wall Street  they're loving it  wait who's the  guy in Wall Street  calling for like  a Boston Tea Party  type thing  like don't  just don't  he was a reporter  well that's what  we're getting at  Rick Santelli  yeah but he had  this was some 
[01:20:00]  fun TV yesterday  he was in Chicago  and he had  he had all the  troops behind him  though at the  what was it  the commodities exchange  hold on hold on  Stump Ray  he's always on the  floor of the exchange  and they do this  spin around all  the various markets  and Santelli  always walks the  floor and talks  to the guys back  home and he had  some interesting  responses yesterday  they were all  whooping and  hollering for him  it was just one  of those moments  he wasn't going  for anything at  first and then  all of a sudden  he got swept away  and just started  yelling and screaming 
[01:20:30]  all the liberals  might want to  turn their radios  off  this might get  to him  and it has to  be pointed out  that the people  that were responding  to Rick Santelli  weren't the big  wigs  they were like  kind of like  clerks  and you know  kind of the  lower level  of the finance  what  they're the  Chicago exchange  that's where  they were  over there  the floor guys  so here's what  Rick did yesterday  hey Rick  what  who thought 
[01:21:00]  they're like  putty  they're like  putty in your  hands  did you hear  well they're not  Joe  they're not like  putty in our  hands  this is America  how many of you  people want to  pay for your  neighbor's mortgage  that has an  extra bathroom  and can't pay  their bills  raise their hand  how about we all  President Obama  are you listening  how about we all  stop paying our  mortgage  it's a moral  hazard  this is like  mob rule here  I'm getting scared  this guy's a little 
[01:21:30]  annoyed because  they actually brought  something up  you might have a  clip on it  where they talk  about the fact  that they want  to lower the  interest rates  for these people  that can't afford  their mortgage  payments  right  and then they  they said that  if the mortgage  rate was zero  they still couldn't  afford the  principal  right  they can't afford  these houses  and they're being  given money  to keep their  houses that they  can't afford 
[01:22:00]  right  even if they  had  yeah  it's a weird  situation  I'd still  rather see that  than see banks  get bailed out  well you know  what the country  needs banks  I know  the unfortunate  thing is you  can't have the  banks folding  and people making  a run to  withdraw their  money  the problem  right now is  the fact that  the banks  even though  they're there  aren't lending  money  if the banks  weren't there  where are people  getting their  money  the mob  well people  I'm not saying  we should pay 
[01:22:30]  for people who  just have  overextended  I have more  I guess  empathy for  someone that  is overextended  because they  want to live  in a home  and they want  to get into  a better  situation  than the  scumbag  banking industry  which has the  money and just  doesn't give it  out  and all the  dirty crap  they've been  doing for all  these years  I have no  mercy for any  of these major  companies  because there's  a selfishness  and a vindictiveness  in what they do  where somebody  just trying to  keep a house  is trying to  keep a house  but Anthony  makes a really  good point  these people  are way 
[01:23:00]  overextended  it's not even  going to come  close to  helping them  out  however  we all got  caught up  in it  the place  I'm living  in  I'm like  what  it's worth  what  and why  and everyone  did the same  thing  and just  hoped for  the best  well I guess  in the next  30 years  I'll figure  out something  to pay  for this  house  it was  just what  you had  to do  if you  wanted to  own your  own home  but a lot  of people  went way  above their  means  and overextended  themselves 
[01:23:30]  and now  the taxpayers  are paying  for it  it's like  oh I like  when they  say this  too  whenever you  hear  that  GM  Ford  Ford  doesn't want  to be  lumped in  with GM  you saw that  yesterday  right  Chrysler  the mortgage  companies  the banks  they're looking  for government  loans and money  or actually  government  handouts  bailouts  whenever you  hear government  that is  you  that's not  the government  this is  taxpayers 
[01:24:00]  money  this is  your money  that is  being used  to bail  out  the banks  right  in that  situation  since it's  our money  I think  somebody  should  oversee  how it's  being used  and if  it's being  used  wisely  if it's  being used  to our  best  interest  because  it's  people  they hear  these numbers  when you hear  trillions  and government  it becomes  an unreal  thing  you can't 
[01:24:30]  wrap your  mind around  it  it's like  the universe  is infinite  try to figure  that one out  so you hear  trillions  and government  you just think  alright  it's more  of this  bureaucracy  and oh  it's an amount  of money  I can't even  figure out  it's  what you  did in  April  it's what  you  the check  you wrote  that's where  that money  is coming  from  so you  have the  right  to  accountability  we do  from these  people  apparently  but  if they're 
[01:25:00]  still giving  out  multi  billions  in bonuses  and things  then there's  a problem  and again  speak up  you know  open your eyes  speak up  be involved  and write  emails  or whatever  you want  I've never  done that  in my life  written a  letter  to  congressmen  to  state  officials  to the  senators  and stuff  until  like this  year 
[01:25:30]  you're writing  letters  emails  you actually  write emails  I have a whole  big thing  going on  with the  second  amendment  right now  that I'm  so you're  involved in  that  yes  alright  so I'm  making sure  our  senators  get  you think  they're  reading  your  emails  I don't  know  I doubt it  I bet your  letters  my suggestion  would be  print out  what you  write  in an email  or print it  out on a  microsoft word  document  and then just  mail it  mail it  I think that  they get more  attention  than this  I don't know  why but when  someone hand  writes a letter  it really does  move people 
[01:26:00]  you know what  they probably  do  they probably  sprinkle baby  powder on it  and then  send the police  to your house  look at what  he sent me  what was that  hope  it's hard to  get in  step on you  it's fine  we got another  clip of Rick  Santelli  here on CNBC  cool I wonder  if he was  yelling and  screaming about  the bonuses  these guys  were getting  where was Rick  Santelli  screaming about  how our faces  are being raped  we're giving  bailouts  and they still  want to give  these scumbags 
[01:26:30]  it's a weird  situation  we're between  a rock and  a hard place  these banks  need the money  or we're all  screwed  but you can't  tell them what  to do with  the money  for the most  part  and that's  what Obama  is yelling  about  but how  is he  going to  get that  figured out  he said  a $500,000  maximum  he said it  but how  is it  actually  going to  be enacted  who does  it  get something  signed  it's in  the bill  so it is  in the bill  it's in the bill  and it's retro  so that'll help  a little bit  and then the money  itself  they're not 
[01:27:00]  lending it  they're using  it for other  interests  to try to  make money  on the money  they're being  lended  but they're not  helping the economy  which is this  that we're supposed  to do  by again  lending to  responsible  people  that can  pay back  people just  aren't going  in for loans  for the most part  and people that  are being  turned down  in droves  because unless  you have  a crystal  clear  a clean 
[01:27:30]  credit record  you're not  getting accepted  because we're a  country of  vultures  there's no  it's like people  say well  I believe  I don't want  a socialist  country at all  but the flip  side is  if you have  no government  mandating stuff  this is what  you get  like the banks  do you ever  think the banks  are going to  act humanely  towards you  like do you  ever think  that they're  ever going  to  you know  what  give this  guy  never  they will  never do  that  this is the  banks reacting  from 30  years of being  told they had  to make  these bad 
[01:28:00]  loans  they had  to give  money to  people  who didn't  deserve it  listen  just because  it was brought  up that a lot  of these people  are overextending  beyond their  means  it's a much  bigger problem  this guy  I don't even  know how to  say his name  he's going  to have to  say it  from Jersey  this is what  I was thinking  too  go ahead  sir  I don't  know  Prentice  yeah  Prentice  okay  go ahead  yeah  I just bought  a house  a year ago  after the  market started  the fall  and I agree 
[01:28:30]  with Opie  that you know  people got to  live within their  means but  because the  market was so  out of control  by these people  living outside  of their means  I definitely  think I overpay  for my house  but I'm  living you know  I'm making  the payments  every month  there you go  it's tough  it's tough  but I'm doing it  and I'm not  going to be  getting a bailout  from the government  because I would  go hungry  before I would  declare bankruptcy  your tax money  is bailing  someone else out  by the way  but it's safe  to say that 
[01:29:00]  everyone  everyone overpaid  for their houses  yeah right now  I mean I went  through the thing  I went through  the thing  I was looking  for over a year  and a half  in the suburbs  in the city  I'm like  they want  how much  for what  but the market  was paying it  dude I bought  it was insane  at the tippity top  of the bubble  I bought  at the absolute  time where housing  was at its most  expensive  everybody was  throwing their arms  up going  I can't believe  my house increased  100% in two years 
[01:29:30]  and that's when  I bought  I got families  I mean  I'm lucky in my life  but I got family  members that are  in houses  and they weren't  overextending  themselves by any means  they wanted a house  in a relatively nice  neighborhood  with enough rooms  for their kids  they're struggling  they're not living  in some  multi-million dollar  effing gated  community type house  it's a regular house  and that's what  the average person did  they overpaid  for the houses  they didn't have  a choice  unless you want 
[01:30:00]  to live in the ghetto  or in some  horrific place  I was reading  a bunch of  things that came  out of WAMU  and they were  they were forced  a lot of the workers  at WAMU  were forced  to just make  the loan  they were told  by their superiors  I don't care  make up  an income  for this guy  they were actually  told  this guy  came in for a loan  and they go  to their supervisor  and go  look this guy 
[01:30:30]  he barely works  he makes  $20,000  a year maybe  and he's looking  to get a loan  for this  half a million dollar  house  he can't do it  and they would  tell them  well what does  he do  he's a musician  alright  well make him  as a musical  director  boost up his  salary  and they lied  they blatantly  would lie  on these sheets  just to get  the loan out there  now Mike  you said it was  because they're  being forced  to do it  but couldn't 
[01:31:00]  it be that  the banks  wanted to make  these loans  because they're  making interest  on them  and if they  foreclose  they just resell  the house  and win anyway  doesn't their  greed  have anything  they're not  this mom and pop  operation  all this was  built in  there was a  segment of the  banking that was  forced to make  loans to people  who couldn't  afford it  there was a  greedy segment  of the banking  industry that  did make  125% loans  at the peak  of the market  and then would  package those  loans and sell  them in these  weird derivative  security markets  that then crumbled 
[01:31:30]  so yeah there  were different  ends of it  but the banks  were forced to  go from 4%  risky loans  to almost 40%  risky loans  in the last  30 years  and that was  a horrible  thing that they  did that put  the onus on  the banks  to go into  the other  greedy end  so yeah  there's guilt  all around  but did it  put the onus  on them  to go into  the greedy  end  or is the  fact that  they were  in the  greedy end  put the  onus on  them  to make  other kind  of loans  I'm not  saying the  banks are  completely at  fault  125%  loans are  just a  recent issue  and those  derivatives are  recent 
[01:32:00]  this started  back in  the 70s  when they  started forcing  community banks  to make  loans to  risky  individuals  we will  guarantee it  yeah  they have  Fannie and  Freddie  I want to  get the  second part  of the  Rick Santelli  clip on the  air here  from CNBC  then he  continued  live on TV  how about  the notion  that  Wilbur  pointed out  you can  go down  to 2%  on the  mortgage  you can  go down  to minus  2%  and still  have 40%  not be able  to do it  so why  are they  in the  house  why are we 
[01:32:30]  trying to  keep them  in the  house  Mr.  Summers  is a  great  economist  but boy  I'd love  the answer  to that  one  Jason  we're  thinking of  having a  Chicago  tea party  in July  all you  capitalists  that want  to show  up to  Lake  Michigan  I'm  going to  start  organizing  what are  you jumping  in this  time  there you  go  pretty much  you can  make the  rate  whatever you  want  they still  can't  afford  they can't  afford  it  can't  afford  it  we're  aft  this is  an ugly 
[01:33:00]  situation  how about  we stop  giving money  to other  countries  how about  we take  10 billion  dollars  that we're  going to  give some  other scummy  nation  and give  it to  people  who  they  overextended  but no  one's  complaining  that we're  giving money  to other  countries  that overextended  I'm tired  of it  I understand  there are  certain people  that shouldn't  be in their  houses  because they  were douches  and they  bought something  eight times  they could  afford  I'm talking  about people  that were  kind of  close  and figured  they could  work it  out 
[01:33:30]  and couldn't  lost the  job  the economy  turned  yeah the  ruthlessness  with people  want to deal  with them  how about  we deal  with certain  banks that  way  with other  countries  that we've  been given  money to  yeah  take money  out of  our  of course  they did  the banks  knew that  a lot of  these people  were going  to have  a real  tough time  making their  mortgage payment  every month  they didn't  care  because they  were making  money  either way  you know  what I was  thinking at  the gym  the other  day I  gotta say  this very  carefully  I was  thinking about  how the  economy 
[01:34:00]  I mean the  world is in  a weird  place right  now  I'm like  there's gonna be a  situation to take  care of it  you think a  situation  I'm gonna  I'm gonna  I'm gonna  I'm gonna  just say  a situation  let's just  say  a thinning  of the  herd  and that  scares the  crap out  of me  oh like  a plague  or  I'm just  saying a  situation  media  a situation  but  I was  thinking  well how  how does  the world  get out  of this  mess  well if  there's  a situation  that  thins  the herd  it makes  it a lot 
[01:34:30]  easier  to kind  of you know  bounce  back  zombies  how cool  would that  be  because  I'm  I'm  friggin  and I  said  I don't  find  and I  don't  trust  I don't  trust  our  government  I don't  trust  the world  government  come up  my house  me  Danny  zombies  cool  yeah  but you  know what  I'm saying  zombies  you know  what I'm  saying  yes  how else  do we  get out  of this  when  hell  is  full  the dead  will walk  the earth  all right  then we  get the  look  open the  gates  let the  zombies  out 
[01:35:00]  zombies  how is  hell  full  just put  more  of them  in there  the dead  will walk  the earth  there's got  to be a  reason why  they're going  to walk  the earth  there's  maximum  occupancy  like an  elevator  yeah  you gotta  sometimes  people get  in and they  go okay  I'll wait  hell starts  dinging and  then a few  people have  to get  out  and a few  people gotta  go walk  around  what do you  think of that  thought really  zombies  a situation  a situation  yeah  and would that  solve a lot 
[01:35:30]  of these  world  issues  uh  yeah  yeah  I think  it was  they say  that war  like solves  a lot  of uh  war  yeah  world  problems  world war  would solve  that would  we've been  in a war  for you know  quite a few  years  it's uh  hmm  it hasn't  helped  done nothing  it's hurt  but um  AIDS didn't  solve anything  starvation  didn't solve  anything  you know  I noticed  the economy  really starting  to turn  and I know  the housing  thing  had a lot  to do  with it  but when  the price  of gas  started shooting  up to like  five bucks  a gallon 
[01:36:00]  uh  it really  screwed  things up  because  gas  you know  drives  the  planet  and  it really  made  everything  expensive  and now  gas is  real cheap  but things  are still  screwy  so  gas is  going up  though  right  people  stopped  buying  SUVs  gas just  took another  dump  today  though  but we've  gone from  150  to almost  two bucks  yeah  it's been  moving upwards  again  193 now  but how did  that  how it  like  again  all these  terrible 
[01:36:30]  people that  overextended  again a lot  of them  were idiots  but how  how does  that happen  how are we  all of a  sudden  allowing  these  filthy  countries  to dictate  that we're  paying  450 a  gallon  it's  irritating  how we  if we're  going to  go invade  a country  Saudi Arabia  take it  there you go  we got it  that's that's  too complicated  Jimmy  come on  just take it  that's too  logical  or something  yeah  it's about  refining  we're not  refining as much  yeah well  start refining  and drilling  again  I say it 
[01:37:00]  again  I say  three cents  a gallon  our politicians  are a joke  we gotta  take another  break here  why did  you just  hand me  tissues  oh thank  you  wow  that's  perceptive  I thought  I was  sniffling  into the  mic  he was  trying to  help you  out  we'll try  to lighten  it up a little  bit  we got an  Oscar  moment  why  I don't  need tampons  oh okay  Oscar  is the  Sunday  fishing  through the  garbage  Oscar  moment  on the

[01:41:30]  you throw  the keys  of a  Lamborghini  I'm still  going to  go out  Karen  is if  someone was  driving  angrily  you know  someone's  driving  angry  yeah  and you're  afraid  you're  going to  go through  the back  of a dump  truck  so maybe  that was  I don't  know  it's the  only way  to drive  though  quite frankly  angry  it's fun  that way  all right  and the  Osbournes  we got the  trailer  for their  new variety  show  this can't  be good  it can only  be good  first of all  anything  variety  show  is as 
[01:42:00]  dated as a  pet rock  or a mood  ring  well they're  they're kind  of doing  variety  shows  though  America's  Got Talent  that's not  a variety  show  they're sort  of  doing it  no  the variety  show  you're going to  see the variety  show come back  that's the problem  let me tell you  what the Osbournes  are going to make  every channel  have a variety  show  the variety  show is  you take  a host  or numerous  hosts  usually based  around some  kind of subject  like a family  a television show 
[01:42:30]  things like that  right  and then  every week  they do  sketches  little comedy  sketches  maybe a little  song and dance  number that is  inappropriate  for them  to do  and then  special  celebrity  guests  that join  in on the  hijinks  that's a good  point  and that  is your  variety  show  that is  your  typical  staple  variety  show  think  Brady Bunch  think  Sonny and Cher  think  all that  crap  the Osmonds 
[01:43:00]  the Glenn  Campbell  show  Jonathan  Winner's  variety  show  Flip Wilson  Flip Wilson  Laughin  was that  a variety  show  sort of  Laughin  was a  variety  show  Rosie O'Donnell  Rosie O'Donnell  what are you  talking about  that was a good  one  wait Rosie O'Donnell  tried this in  December  where did that  show go  was it ever  on TV  did anyone  see it  no  it was so  bad it was  one and done  it had  Liza Minnelli  showing up  and all kinds  of crazy 
[01:43:30]  was that  one and done  that show  yeah  it was supposed  to be a pilot  to kick off  a weekly  variety show  boy she  started  she annoyed  people so  much  with her  stupid  9-11  views  people were  like I'm  right with  this fat  so  yeah she  just went  over the  edge  she was  like  she was  loved  during her  TV show  especially  when it  first started  then she  started  getting a  little  lippy  with her  stupid  politics  uninformed  politics  by the  way 
[01:44:00]  and  yeah  Tom Selleck  gets on  and she  hijacks  or blindsides  him  and then  she just  started  going off  like a  lunatic  about 9-11  and the  conspiracy  theories  and saying  that some  of these  buildings  were blown  up  not knowing  what goes  behind  demolishing  a building  with dynamite  yeah  dummy  you big  fat load  but they  just drop  you on  the roof  she made  news this  week too  she stopped  blogging  oh why  people loved 
[01:44:30]  her blogging  how about  she stopped  eating  stop blobbing  let's see  what the  Osbournes  are  hogging  all the  food  I got  a million  of them  hogging  I'm gonna  watch  Jimmy  very closely  here  because  in his  eyes  Ozzy  and the  rest  of them  can't  do  anything  wrong  infallible  right  there's  something  to be  said  about  having  your  rock  stars  go  away  I'm a  huge  Kurt Cobain  fan  I'm bummed  he died  but you  start thinking  what would  he be  doing  if he  was alive  today  it probably 
[01:45:00]  wouldn't  be good  no  right  is that  picture  from  stakeout  yeah  yeah  where they  try to  make her  look like  she was  the hot  the hot  girl  what was  it called  I think  it's a movie  called  exit to  Eden  yes  you're  right  and she's  dressed as  a little  dominatrix  type thing  a big  dominatrix  thing  in some  kind of  a rubber  suit  or leather  whatever it  is  leather corset  with some  leather  like  bracers 
[01:45:30]  around her  arm  and stockings  she looks  awful  she looks  better there  than she does  now though  well  why does she  look awful  she's  60 to 70  pounds lighter  than she is  today  maybe 100  pounds lighter  than she is  today  they were  trying to  make her  look like  she's a  sex pot  yeah  you know  the corset  was holding  in a world  of hurt  she was  probably  having a  tough time  breathing  they probably  pinned the fat  behind her  back  kurt's  birthday's  today  thank you  travis  what  i should  know this  he would 
[01:46:00]  have been  42  really  oh my god  no he was a  youngster  yep 27  i think  27  he made  the 27  club  so  the osborne  variety show  i think has  potential  all right  let's take a  listen  it certainly  does for a  big chill  of the douche  variety  disagree  we got  the wise  ass  sam  robertson  studio  sam  i got  to watch  the trailer  they put  out an  extended  two minute  trailer  and it  showed you  a lot of  the things  you can  expect  some of  the things  anthony  described 
[01:46:30]  sketches  musical  performances  but i mean  what really  this is the  big intro  to the clip  what network  is it on  fox  oh fox  all right  edgy  fox is known  for bringing  you the most  outrageous  families on  television  now we're  doing it again  with sharon  jack  kelly  and ozzy  it's the  osborne's  reloaded  a new kind  of comedy  show  like you've  never seen  before  get ready  to go  wild 
[01:47:00]  get ready  to go  wild  that's right  that we're  getting ready  for  oh that's  just the  announcer  well of  course it  is  yeah  no that  was ozzy  saying  oh boy  okay  ozzy's got  one of those  guns and he's  shooting shirts  into the audience  can she let  this poor son  of a bitch  just sit down  and and sleep  can she just  leave him alone  for a little  while and let  him just  enjoy his 
[01:47:30]  his uh  aging  family's too  crazy not to  be on tv  they gotta  it's that  it's insane  is that  it sam  really  they just  have it  in their  blood  i got  showbiz  in my  blood  you gotta  think ozzy  doesn't want  to do  any of  this  no  he wants  to tour  though  this is not  a straight  on his  voice  this is  probably  a cake  walk  doing this  as opposed  to the road  he goes  to one  of his  castles  and enjoys  his life  oh i 
[01:48:00]  don't know  he's a rocker  it's what  it does  the rocker  doesn't do  a stupid  variety show  like the  hudson brothers  did  the hudson brothers  had a variety  show  all right  what's this  next clip  there uh  sam  well one of  the skits  is the  osbornes  undercover  and they  have ozzy  you know how  sometimes when  you drive  through at  a fast food  restaurant you  talk to the  person on the  other end  sure  well imagine  if that  was ozzy  i'd love to  get food from  that place  no stop it  wait a minute  wait wait wait  wait you're 
[01:48:30]  saying ozzy  is taking  orders at a  fast food  restaurant  drive-thru  he's hard  to understand  face to face  right imagine  coming out of  that little  speaker  oh god i gotta  see this  yes let's  roll tape  hamburger combo  no pickles  no pickles  no onions  no onions  no mayo  sure you want  a burger  yes  all right  come on  well he threw 
[01:49:00]  fries at the  window  then he threw  he noticed  the laughter  after that  they pulled  up to the  studio  she pulled  up to the  window after  making that  order and  and um  ozzy having  that that  great line  and then  and then ozzy  just threw  french fries  through the  drive-thru window  and into her  car window  but can you  like the  thing about it  is it's like  if you're going  to a fast food  place you expect  to get it  your way  you know  and so you're  saying  no mayo  no lettuce  ozzy can you 
[01:49:30]  imagine if  somebody's there  saying are you  sure you want  a burger  oh sam  the way you put  it now i get it  i'll say i think  ozzy was probably  annoyed that they  were saying i don't  want this i don't  want that i don't  want that and he  said you sure you  want an effing  burger that's what  i would say  right right  but french fries  are safe why  can't he throw  like hot coffee  or bowling ball  or or the shakes  or the uh  bullets the soda  french fries  aren't gonna  do damage  i see now  it's steaming  hot coffee 
[01:50:00]  wow  oh yeah  that'd be going  just burns  yeah  third degree  burn  so far i like  it  all right  come on  jimmy's insane  i do  the oscores play  with the audience  i wish i was in  the audience  i'm sure you do  what happens is  this isn't audio  friendly for the  radio per se but  oh no  they get a person  in the audience  and say who here  would make out with  a stranger for a  hundred bucks  and so they get a  good looking guy and  a good looking girl  and say you and a  homeless guy  i didn't go for i  didn't get a hundred  bucks  you did that for a 
[01:50:30]  pilot that obviously  was never going to be  picked up  it still might get  how desperate are  you  you're still hoping  we never heard from  those guys again  the tape is still  in existence  it was so bad  they didn't even  acknowledge we ever  made it  they taped over it  i'm sure  it was so bad  we never even got  the call  they just made  believe we never  existed  never happened  but it could be  that makes you feel  good as a performer  yeah  maybe they want it  for the fall  yeah okay  possible  but then they  blindfold a good 
[01:51:00]  looking guy with  the girl in front of  him and he's ready  to kiss her  uh oh  uh oh  what happens  there's an old  woman backstage  that they pull out  from the curtains  stop  and while he's  blindfolded he's  kissing the old  lady  hey by the way  wow yeah  uh jimmy gets  very mad when  other bands uh  rip off black  sabbath  uh spiro  with that in mind  has something  spiro  hello good audio  uh this hacky  uh drive-thru bit  letterman did it  years ago didn't he  yeah letterman did 
[01:51:30]  this bit a lot  where all of a sudden  people are like  wow what the  letterman was  taking my order  i don't get mad  if someone does  a sabbath cover  and this is  basically a cover  um no one would  think that this  bit's an original  concept of you  know fish out of  water type thing  that's been done  many times so  that the interesting  thing is just to  see ozzy doing  something that is uh  no variety show  sketch is really  gonna be  original  yeah you can have  variations on crap  that's been done  what are you gonna do  they dress in wacky  clothes or  spiro he can explain 
[01:52:00]  everything this uh  jimmy  he'll put then ozzy  to his last breath  hey if it's not good  i'll say it's not good  i'll watch the show  all right what's the  last clip there uh sam  well what they did was  they took two little  kids and had them go  buy movie tickets but  they dressed up the  little kids  they dressed up the  little kids as ozzy and  sharon and they talk  uh they profanely  no it's a it's a  sketch it's not like  a hidden camera thing  so i mean ticket  takers in on it and 
[01:52:30]  everything oh okay  oof well you scared  me for a second yeah  i didn't want to make  anyone nervous but  you did still you can  imagine with this clip  i like children cursing  welcome to majestic  cinemas  turn for a jack of the  blind tape batch three  i'm sorry that film's  rated r and i've got  the over 18 see it  look at you you're  barely out of  f***ing appies yourself  can't tell us what the  f*** to do  um look those are  the rules  and this is not  this we are coming  in and you can  shove your f***ing 
[01:53:00]  balls up your  wow that's like a  sketch yeah that's  one of the wacky  comedy sketches i  would i would have to  see the the oh  there's the video  all right and it  looks like a little  like little ozzy and  little sharon i must  say though little  english kids cursing  probably the most  adorable thing  besides a chimp in an  engineer costume  yes or in a driveway  right having a nose  sandwich  with a side order of 
[01:53:30]  jaw  i bet you the show  does very well  it'll fight its audience  will it  i think so  i don't  you think it's gonna be  a bust  i see  dude if bromance  does well  the great silver  doors of the enola  gay opening up  oh yeah  wait i said  bromance and what  did sam say  it's brody jenner  what about the 
[01:54:00]  homo uh undertones  they said it's not  even subtle  no they're there  overtones then  yeah they're very much  overtones  what's bromance all  about  well bromance is  when they're competing  it's a bunch of guys  competing to be  brody jenner's new  like best dude friend  i don't know who he is  he's from the hills i think  i take pride in knowing  pop culture  he's one of the hills guys  he's one of the hills guys  all right  you know  when when you hang out  with your dudes all the  time it's like a bromance  it's a romance  but you're bros 
[01:54:30]  it's not like a  if you call  your friendship  with uh  your your guy friends  a bromance  me and intern david  have a bromance  well  you better learn how to  fake snore in a tree fort  because that's a coming  that question  well the term  the term bromance  came from big brother  no that's  i heard it came from  big brother with uh  with that uh  the two dudes  the one that was  the doctor and the other  guy that owned the  clubs in la  that's a showman  a showman  i think he went  i think they came up 
[01:55:00]  with bromance too  well because you and  david worked together  would that be a bro job  right  or a bromance  why would it be important  to have a bromance  yeah  why wouldn't you just  hang out with your  friends  why does it have to  be a bromance  you need to have  your bro  like it's one thing  to be just  oh that's my boy  your wingman  yeah your wingman  hey you want to be  my wingman  yeah  let's go pick up  some broads and  bang them at my place  he's the guy  you can count on  when i go in  yeah  you're my wingman 
[01:55:30]  hey you take one  for the team  and you go home  with fatty  maverick you never  leave your wingman  hey i had to go  home with fatty  because you know  it was her best friend  and my my bromance  exactly  fucker was really  digging that chick  yeah bromance  target rich environment  right  yeah  i hated that whole  wingman thing  now it's bromance  bromance  i used to say  hey fatty beat it  stupid  i'm gonna bang  i'm gonna bang  this one  go home  here's cab fare  i don't need a wingman  to bring the fat broad 
[01:56:00]  home  i did fine  you just worked out  the situation on your own  you're not good for a bromance  doesn't the man's part of bromance  mean romance  it comes from the word romance  yeah but  isn't that something you don't want  with one of your guy's friends  is a romance  i think it's more like the uh platonic part of the relationship with a girl  oh so the row part is the uh that's that's the romantic part  the mance is what 
[01:56:30]  the man mance is like when you're best friends  that's called a man  bromance  yeah it's when you're bro is like your best friend  your confidant  you know what i mean  when times get tough  can you get bromantic with some guy  yeah i mean when you guys have a moment  it's being bromantic  yeah  when you guys are sitting around and be like  dude we just had a moment  i was right  bromance came from big brother  thank you stump right  you can find anything on the internet  face  face  i guess so 
[01:57:00]  yeah  you ever have a wingman  yeah  i had a wingman  we're gonna go in for the kill  here we go  walk in look around  yep yep  let me scope it out  some targets  yeah  i got tone  hey fatty here's some money  go get yourself a sub  i'm gonna be busy for the next couple hours  a bucket of wings  instead of a wingman  that's all you're talking  are you kidding me  you gotta go in with a wingman  if you wanna score the hot broads 
[01:57:30]  yeah  is that right  yes  sam is that right  that's exactly right  you need a good bromance  yeah  do ya  yeah  you know what it works  you go in there with your wingman  target rich environment  yeah  you see your girl sitting at the bar  right  and then uh  you have your wingman go up  and  and  introduce himself  while you're getting ready to turn around  and seeing you lost that love and feeling  right  so you spin around and do it  and then your wingman helps you out  and then 
[01:58:00]  when  when that romance is made  they all peel off  in the  you know  missing man formation  because you're  kind of left behind  to uh  I gotta give credit to the girls out there  because they wanna F just as bad as you do  do they  and the fat friend wasn't getting in the way  this whole  oh  I would love to  but you know  I got  you know  fatty with me  the albatross  I've seen these girls  blow off their fat friend  more times than I could count  ah  they give them the keys  they give them everything  that beat it 
[01:58:30]  there it is  yeah  Tom Cruise singing to Kelly McGillis  who now looks like  this  like  I don't know what she looks like  like Kelly McGillis  Kelly McGillis  she looks  still looks like Kelly  just the male version  oh  she could  he could have a bromance with her now  have you seen the hookup artist on VH1  no  yeah  that's where you learn how to open two sets  and three sets  you mean the pickup artist  the pickup artist  yeah  the pickup artist  it's mystery  yeah  yeah  wait a minute  you open up what 
[01:59:00]  you can open up a two set  what's a two set  Spock explain  if a girl's in the bar  with her friend  sometimes you don't have a bromance  and you gotta go in  and open up a two set  on your own  because you're only gonna be able  to really walk out  with one of them  you're taking on two Migs  yeah  phew  it can be done  those guys are kind of  those guys  I would tell you  there's a book by a guy  called The Game  by Neil Strauss  yeah  about these pickup artists  and the way they  neg girls  like you know  like make fun of them 
[01:59:30]  and all these techniques  they use to get laid  and these guys  bang nothing  but hot chicks  these dumb  it works  are they  good looking guys  average  some of them  probably good looking  but they're weird  they know how to be weird  well quirky  mystery always wears goggles  on his forehead  alright  that's kind of weird  he's a weird guy  but you know what  and he's like a depressed guy  he's not even if it's Eric  he's Canadian  he apparently  would bang nothing  but hot strippers  like the ones that are hard  to get in bed 
[02:00:00]  he would bang them all  wow  there is a method  to it that works  it probably looks terrible  but strippers  were never hard  to get in bed  are you kidding  strippers  to walk out  with a stripper  from a strip club  oh he's walking  out of the strip club  with them  not easy to bang  strippers make their living  convincing people  they might have a shot  and then not doing it  yeah  true  yeah these guys  this book was excellent  hmm  his sidekick's name  is Matador  yeah  they have all weird names  yeah  all weird names  Matador 
[02:00:30]  he says it like  Matador  Matador  alright  did he wear a costume  no  he didn't need a  he had like a furry vest  and what was that called  his costume  costume  costume  you know speaking of reality shows  I wasn't going to mention it  but it made me laugh hard  in the paper  they do a little reality show  recap  you want reality  and they  they did something  they did something on  they did something on 
[02:01:00]  on Love Bus  Brett Michaels  yeah  Rock Bus  whatever it's called  Rock of Love Bus  Rock of Love Bus  sure okay  that too  Jesus Rock of Love Bus  I don't know what  all these papers  are the exact same paper  fly off an embankment  can you look in the other  dopey paper that  thinks they're a newspaper  oh god  Taya Parker  is still on  Rock of Love Bus  yeah we're  we're friends with her  hope she wins  Taya Parker  oh yeah  she's still on there  yeah  yeah  she's doing good 
[02:01:30]  I'll find this  just babble  about anything  I'll be right with you  just babble about anything  I'll be right with you  don't know if right  when we start babbling  you're gonna  you know  find it  here we go  Rock of Love Bus  so they do the reality  bites segment  one of the papers  Jennifer who Brett  invited to join the tour  last week  revealed on Sunday night's  episode  that her father  recently passed away  and that she's  she's still dealing  with her emotions  over the ordeal  but that she wants  to be on the show 
[02:02:00]  because it would make  her father proud  proud  yeah  how is  banging  Brett Michaels  making um  daddy proud  maybe there's a big  Poison fan  oh right  that makes sense  father dies  she doesn't do the  right thing  and leave the show  to be with her family  and go to the funeral  and stuff  she needs to be on  and then she needs  to be on  Rock of Love Bus  because that's what  daddy would want  she finally like  built up the courage  to tell Brett  and she was like  I just want you to know  I'm experiencing a lot 
[02:02:30]  but I love being here  with you  my dad just died  blah blah blah  so Brett gave her the boot  and said she shouldn't  be here  oh wow  kicked her off anyway  kicked her off  and that was the week  where they were mud wrestling  and playing mud football  you know  the type of thing  dad would be proud of  he just didn't want  the thought of maybe  dear old dad  peeking in on her  while you know  because you think  that sometimes  when you're having  a sexual relations  that some of your  dead relatives  could just make  a little visit  because apparently  they could go anywhere  and look in on you  you know what  it's like you know  some girl 
[02:03:00]  or something  and a father dies  and she's in a big play  and things like that  and then she's like  oh thank you  I just wish my father  was here  and then the mother  says something like  you know  he was watching you  he was here  watching your performance  and I'm sure  he was so very proud  it's like  why then  wouldn't he just turn up  at an inopportune moment  like when you're  you know  just doing something  horrific  having sex  and illegal  you're doing that 
[02:03:30]  for the first time  and it's hurting  dropping a deuce  dropping a deuce  Danny just put up  Tub Girl  yeah  was Tub Girl's  father in the room  very dishonorable  even an eye on  his daughter  yeah  I mean  you know what  they did that to me  at my wedding  did they  I was like  I'm bummed  my dad's not here  how do you know  he's not here  and I want to say  because he's dead  because he's dead  and he's not here  and I don't want  to follow me  to the honeymoon  watching that  oh gaping 
[02:04:00]  you know  they mean well  and they try to say  the right thing  but it's like  stop  but do you think  they have  if he was there  he would have  patted me on the back  mysteriously  would have felt it  I would have felt  some mysterious  pat on the back  do you think  they have some  kind of a  you know  ethics  where  alright  I'll come in  and check out  his wedding  but I'm not  gonna like  you know  watch anything  inappropriate  I think they see  everything  but the rules  are so different  now that you're dead  it doesn't matter  like it doesn't matter 
[02:04:30]  that's how I look at it  like you've been  assimilated  like the Borg  you just don't  care  it's not emotional  you like Invasion  of the Body Snatchers  it's good to see  my boys doing  exactly what I did  there he is  let me get  one of my  bromance buddies  up here in heaven  and I'll show him  what he's doing  my thought is  it just doesn't  matter anymore  so it's like  yeah  but then that would  suck  because  then they're  different people  when you meet  them in the light  and go see them  you'll be like  hey were you  checking me out  and they're like 
[02:05:00]  yes  it doesn't matter  to me  I did not care  that you were  having intercourse  and now they're  zombies  heavenly zombies  heavenly zombies  I can't stand that  finishing the  Rock of Love Bus  mystery of the  universe  so she wanted to  stay on the show  because this is  even better  than what I  haven't read yet  and the woman  that writes the  column I guess  we should give her  credit Christina  Canaan or something  like that  I mean terrible  situation  but really  catching Brett's  mono is going  to have  dear dad 
[02:05:30]  smiling  come from  heaven  why not make  a donation  to a good cause  or adopt a puppy  instead  so she trashes  the reality show  with shows  with her reality  bites column  yeah  that Rock of Love  bus I was watching  it in the gym  yesterday though  why am I not  watching this  every week  they were playing  mud football  and one of the  girls strategy  was to rip  the clothes  off  everybody else  just rip  pants off  and they are  barely cubing  out stuff  that and the 
[02:06:00]  playboy show  they showed  one of those  girls stripped  the other night  and they were  cubing out  the area  oh really  and  kind of see  through  and my wife's  like wow  she doesn't  shave  it was obvious  that this woman  doesn't shave  did you do  the squint trick  oh yeah  and then it's  like full  whenever anything's  pixelated  squint  and you'll be  able to see  it  perfectly  yeah  dvd  that show  are uncensored  works great  really  yep  nice  all right  fu line time

[02:44:30]  still represents  fucking it makes  me yearn for the  kent state days  absolutely  they would just  fucking fire  on the students  yeah  fuck them  they knew how  to stop a protest  they sure did  certainly did  they knew how to  change the subject  real quick  they weren't into  that nonsense  no you goddamn hippies  you do that  well look what we do  all right now what  you live on campus  go get crosby stills  national we need a song  i live in brooklyn now  you don't live uh  in a little dorm or  something  i did in the east village

[02:46:00]  is she is she cute  she's adorable  yeah  yeah so maybe  does she go out  you see her in her  underwear and stuff  is she very um  free about walking  around like that  girls do that all  the time  do you have a small  camera that's  inconspicuous  just asking  oh you're into  that huh  i mean  are we on dangerous  ground should we  call the lawyers  we are right  yeah  no  are you kidding  we certainly are not  are you kidding  she's ready to tell  us some  what do you mean  what do you tell  about  what do you tell  what do we want  human resources  got involved  with our 
[02:46:30]  our internship  program  i think  well this is just  an interview  going uh  you know  talking about  roommates  what's the issue  and wait  danny go ahead  no i agree  yeah  believe me  but what's the  word  well last time  something of this  nature popped up  you know there was  an issue because  we don't say pop up  that's so sexually  suggestive  i should be fired  yeah  but uh  they're uh  they seem to  have an issue  because we have  current interns  and um  the internship  program 
[02:47:00]  does not like  to have their  interns  uh treated  in such fashion  all right  well the intern  program should  go to other  shows and not  the opian anthony  show  well that's  what's gonna  happen  you have to  suck your life  away  it's the way  it should be  she wants to  talk about this  on the air  she's talking  about it  i agree  wholeheartedly  i just want to  know  like like  it has nothing  to do with  fcc and  and these weird  satellite rules  that are popping  up out of nowhere  are you uncomfortable  are you uncomfortable  right now that i'm  waving my genitals  she's ready to get 
[02:47:30]  into some hot  lesbian story  i just want to  know what this  is all about  so she walks  around in her  panties and bra  i guess at some  point  yeah we have a  system  and do you  what's the system  we say surprise  time if you're  gonna be in your  underwear  and then super  surprise time is  when it's more  than underwear  now how does that  work what do you  mean you say  surprise time  yeah so it's  optional if you  want to you know  upright your gaze  or just keep  doing what you're  doing oh so  you'll come into  the room and go  like surprise time  yeah and you'll 
[02:48:00]  be in your  underwear exactly  and she'll she'll  like gaze at you  if she wants  and when you hear  surprise time from  her you get like  a little butterflies  kind of like  yeah yeah  travis is suggesting  that we have  surprise time here  yes let's all do  surprise time let's  start with steve  hold on let me  jump in  believe or not i'm  going to be very  responsible all right  what's your name  jill jill uh  you're officially  fired from the  opian anthony  show is this  being responsible  well we're a lot  of fire interns  right um i would 
[02:48:30]  imagine so you  will be rehired at  11 15 by the way  but for this for  the sake of this  uh conversation that  we're having you are  officially fired from  the opian anthony  intern program is  that is that good um  i guess you want me  to you want us to  write a little something  that you have to  sign just uh print  out a fax mcfry  all right back to  surprise time all  right so you  surprise time  officially not an  intern of the opian  anthony show right  now super surprise 
[02:49:00]  time yeah has this  ever happened where  she comes in and goes  super surprise time  yeah it happens  occasionally and  that's when she has  on what not less than  underwear less than  underwear like only one  so like maybe just the  panties and no bra  right how often does  super surprise time  happen i mean less  often than surprise  time but more often  than you think don't  you think that's kind  of a kidney little  play thing that you  two have going that  that is kind of a  prelude to maybe  something uh happening  i mean we'll find 
[02:49:30]  out won't we yeah  for another few weeks  have you gotten do  you do you are you  are you ever alone  together where you're  drinking and just kind  of hanging out she  started drinking  lately nice very good  by the way very good  so she started drinking  what does she like to  drink by the way  oh she used to be into  amaretto sours yeah  now it's beers and  vodka and beers vodka  wine a little heavy  do that's good and  and you you drink a  little bit oh yeah  yeah so oh yeah  no i don't okay yeah  well whatever and  aren't you having a  party this weekend i'm 
[02:50:00]  always having a party  every weekend doesn't  your party start in  about an hour and a  half my party start well  actually on fridays it  starts an hour before  the show ends so it's  party time it's party  time yeah right now  okay uh currently so  now now you you you  drink and sit together  uh is there any  chitchat do you have  sex talk about like  your your former  exploits and things  like that we talk  about boys you talk  about boys yeah does  she ever or have you  ever talked about girls  or interesting girls  even just in a fleeting 
[02:50:30]  passing kind of a  thing i mean i guess  the way that we talk  about any kind of the  one exception rule you  know yeah the one girl  you'd go gay for the  one girl that you'd be  so you've had that and  did she get any kind of  inkling maybe that you  would be into her and  yeah you're still  feeling it out how  long you've been  together roommates um  we were roommates last  spring so i guess a  year and a half a year  and a half roughly that's  a long time have you  ever uh seen her and  and listen to her bring  boys home and and heard 
[02:51:00]  like things i mean sex  things yeah does it  happen does it turn you  on a little bit to hear  her like uh getting all  excited and everything i  wouldn't exactly use the  word turned on more more  like kind of grossed out  really why is it the  racial difference between  them is there no you  you don't like hearing  her maybe getting a little  pleasure do you hear a  moan and things like  that i was thinking maybe  that might get you  excited oh i think i  think it's like the  hearing it and not the  you know being being  involved right right 
[02:51:30]  that's what it is oh  why because you hear  fucking the guy that  shit guys should shut  the fuck up when they're  fucking just let the  girls make noise so the  neighbors could have fun  exactly you could be uh  uh have you ever um  thought about her while  you're you know taking  care of business with  yourself what when you're  taking care of business  by yourself you should  explain further i'm i'm  confused you ever diddled  yourself a little  masturbatory um action  there no no you don't  do that at all i'm not  no no that's really well 
[02:52:00]  it's kind of like they're  kind of icky no offense  to what vaginas yeah  now you'd be into a girl  well like certain but  what would you do with  her faces you know oh  like you would just like  to be into the touching  caressing part and not  the you know glazed donut  face part because if  you're doing it right that  shit better be far head to  fucking adam's apple  absolutely  adam's apple yeah well for  a guy i'm just saying you 
[02:52:30]  know my and ear to ear by  the way okay your face  should look like it has  salve on it  yeah but you're not into  that at all see girls are  weird sometimes they don't  understand how guys can  look at a vagina and think  this is the greatest thing  that has ever been put on  this earth uh you know some  girls are very self  conscious of it i don't  know it looks funny it looks  silly it looks it's  confusing yeah and but i  think i think some guys are 
[02:53:00]  a little you know self  conscious about their uh  their dicks when it comes  to that too they're kind  of goofy i'll be honest  now you you sexually  active uh yeah you have  been for how long about  three years three years  yeah okay responsible all  right she proved uh and  what do you think of that  part do you think that's  kind of goofy do you do you  get turned on when you see  it it does it have to be  working and an inaction for  you to be turned on i guess  well it's kind of goofy 
[02:53:30]  looking but i'll say this  that i prefer i'm given  the option of lady cards  you know like playing  cards and and male playing  cards and choose the lady  ones just because it's more  familiar yeah like like if  you're if you're looking at  threatening if you're  looking at porno yeah you'd  rather look at girls naked  girls yeah than naked guys  most likely really yeah do  guys uh bring you to the  ultimate pleasure the uh you  know the the big o do they  um they give you that yeah  yeah okay and is that 
[02:54:00]  through intercourse or  through you gotta be doing  all kinds of other things  because i know some girls  it's like working fucking  machinery your hands are  going your hips moving your  knees got to move you're  doing fucking push-ups i  think i think i'm pretty  easy to please yeah yeah  oh really this is good we're  getting to like you know  know you a little more yeah  it's much better than fucking  bringing that goddamn jew in  here and talking to him  another friday fuck him well  we got a situation with  him though why a major 
[02:54:30]  problem we got a major  problem so we're leading  to that but we went off on  a nice tangent here just  you know it's it's good to  i think and some people  think it's just for  titillation i think you  learn a lot about someone  through their sexuality and  how they are if they're  easy going with it if they're  uptight with it things like  that you seem very easy  going you're easy to talk to  about it um very confident  you're very i think you're  very normal when it comes  to that i think a lot of  chicks are into chicks  especially just the way 
[02:55:00]  they look naked not  necessarily you know  burying your fucking face  in the carpet but uh you  think they're really which  is really hot by the way  you think they're really  into chicks or it's just  like a trend it's thing to  do no no i think they're  very into girls bodies are  fucking beautiful and if  you work of art even if  you're a girl uh i think  they appreciate that  softness and curves without  the having you know hey i  want to you know tap that  ass i'm not arguing that  that's that's again but 
[02:55:30]  what i'm trying to say  here is when we were  growing up why wasn't this  lesbian thing happening i  think it was if you if you  talk to women if you talk  to women when they call up  and say yeah i'm fucking  yeah i'm in my 40s let me  tell you when i was 10  years old and me and my  friend did this i think it  was happening well this is  what i do goodbye goodbye  goodbye goodbye goodbye  goodbye goodbye i want to  know if it's a trend or if  women have always been  doing this lesbian thing  because now it's like  completely accepted and if  you're not like finger  popping your your best 
[02:56:00]  friend you're you're you're  a freak but she's not  doing that is what it is  and i think that i think a  large majority of the  girls love the woman's form  and their body and the way  it feels and everything  like that uh and would like  to maybe just like what lay  down in bed a little  massaging touching yeah  cuddling up and falling  asleep i think that's i  think that's kind of a  thing you talk about see  i gotta come it's just the  way it is you're talking  about a nude woman being a 
[02:56:30]  work of art like when you  look at a guy's ball bag  that's like a work of art  right oh yeah hairy and  saggy that's fantastic  oniony yeah that's that's  what you want to look at  the same thing right oh  yeah like girls girls bodies  uh in magazines and in  photographs can absolutely  be works of art that could  be displayed um you know  anywhere really but the  guy's body is pretty much  just built for pornography  just disgusting hairy 
[02:57:00]  fucking rods and balls and  asshole who needs that  unless you're beard rubbing  me asshole right are you  fine with uh this  conversation oh yeah i  think it's been handled  tastefully yeah but let's  get it out there because  we will hear from the  dopes that think they know  what good radio is so you  know she's willing to  discuss this openly right  no one forced you jesus  danny can you put that  picture away please  what  guy's got a big bag  here one you want to see

[03:05:30]  fuck is your cervix by your lungs holy  shit stuff to come by too i was reading  a statistic about about cock size yeah  and i think uh to to even get over i  think seven and a half you're looking at  like under seven percent of the  population seven percent yeah like  everybody almost ten percent of the  population  almost almost everybody falls in that in  that like you know like four and a  half to like six and a half category  four and a half but i'm saying and then 
[03:06:00]  everything else is like the like the  it's measuring from the asshole the  bottom 15 percent you're just like  trying out it's like you get a heart on  and feel back like hey the underside of  my taint's hard i'll measure from  fucking here i'll measure from  underneath your ball bag yeah i feel a  muscle in my asshole from your  fucking that's part of my dick from  your tailbone i just i just measure my  leg i'll shove that in there you go take  this you got bigger things than your  dick your fucking fist look i'm i'm 
[03:06:30]  fucking i'm two feet long and as thick  as a baby's apple or an arm clutching  a baby's apple baby's head baby's  apple all right why don't we take the  apples are small let's get jill out of  here oh we gotta eat yes jill you were  cool with this oh yeah because i don't  feel like dealing with phone calls and  email today that's totally cool with  what we asked you and it was all right  and you didn't feel forced none of  that there's a good little interview i  think yeah thank you for doing that  put your top actually we appreciate  distribution of lifestyles penis length 
[03:07:00]  data what is this i i always have a  home page i like it funny about the  graph it looks like a penis oh wow well  you tell me to work the crowd on friday  so this is the this is the questions i  asked what i i suck it uh i said yes  you did i suck at graphs though what the  fuck is what this is basically saying  this is uh the percentage of men that  have this penis size so for instance if  you look at the percentage of men who 
[03:07:30]  have five inch penises and that's it  you're looking at under five percent in  china it's over 99 but you think you see  here by this according to this graph  anybody you know to even be over seven  you're already under you're way under  five percent that's looking like two  percent of the pop of the male  population has is bigger than seven  inches well basically it's saying like  ten percent have a five and a five  incher ten percent of the country have  a five inch dick six and a six inch  cock you're looking at twenty five  twenty five percent and like six and a 
[03:08:00]  quarter we'll call that is like another  twenty five percent so you're looking at  half the men in this country have six  inch penises yeah that's that's the  average but then it's always been the  average drops drastically yeah then it  drops drastically when it goes up higher  the nine inches are barely represented on  the graph and to be perfectly way less  to be perfectly honest with you those  those two twenty five percent marks  that's before six it's it's just  slightly before six the nine inches is  at what percent it's like under it's  like almost it's under one percent yet  it's fifty percent of the prison  population i don't get it  even your stats all right we gotta take 
[03:08:30]  a break you don't want to talk about  penis more come on we'll do it during  the break fuck it you want to play that  wonder boner thing again a little  surprise for david after the break  on david things open anthony and jim  norton  a lot of people disturbed that uh danny  was looking up dick sizes on the  internet  why it says please please don't let  danny slide for saying he was

[03:09:30]  fat dicks absolutely you know  can you google image big fat dicks sure  let's do it again probably autocomplete  gary in new york gary hey boys what's  going on hey man i want to know what  normal guy goes online and just decides  how big the big cock what normal guy  doesn't well listen man i mean we first  of all we're not normal guys we do a  radio show and you know we got to we  got to you know make sure we're doing 
[03:10:00]  the right thing for the listeners  exactly what's wrong with testing your  gag reflexes see if it's normal yeah  i thought i was listening to ron and  fence for a second like like the guys  out there weren't just sitting there  and barely breathing waiting for what  the average dick size is yes  god oh god please please be four and a  half the average please  please pull out my own people rule  jesus christ look at this how's the first  this is the first result big fat cock  big fat dicks that is a big and a fat and

[03:47:00]  how this happened and it's still fucking night time yeah but you're in bed all of you are  completely naked all right you just fast forwarded eight hours i have to this guy ain't fucking  giving shit out that's true that's what my fantasy is everyone has a different fantasy they're both  naked one of them is bruised like rihanna and the other one has a clit like agent brody's nose  you're chasing brody you're chasing one down the hallway with a chainsaw  exactly like your son hides in the kitchen what's wrong with contact scatman brothers 
[03:47:30]  what's wrong with adrian brody's nothing in particular it's a clip david go ahead  yes david uh so now you're in bed all right we skipped a minute okay yeah yeah you're finally  because after everybody's like clothes are pretty much off and everything you said hey why don't  we take it to the bedroom and they giggled okay i'm just helping you out here fine fine  so you you all go into the bed and now what happens how do you  a mild-mannered man such as yourself satisfy two girls at the same time right go yeah well 
[03:48:00]  um we're in the bed and we're pretty much just like making out and then i'm proceeding to uh  you know just uh make out with one of them i want i'm first of course moving on to the next one  you can get a dog starting getting on your side those are your only choices  oh that's do you kiss one while you put your coppery asshole in the mouth of the other  uh i don't think so i'm not into the whole asshole type type like for them kissing that i don't know  you don't like you rock 
[03:48:30]  eric oh wow you must get him really drunk so then so then i pretty i pretty much just say i pretty  much and after we're kissing and we're making out and i pretty much i'm ready for the sex at this  point right oh the attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes stays laser praise  i mean whatever happens your toes are still tap right right whatever you say right so so now  he said he's ready for what you're ready for what i'm ready to have sex with him already at this point 
[03:49:00]  so you're ready to have finally have sex yes i think so yeah how does this work you have to  satisfy two girls at the same time yeah how do you do this that's right you can you can obviously  bore a million people yes how do you satisfy two girls it's very difficult to satisfy two at the  same time like with one if i'm having sex with one you got to think about that if i'm having sex  with one the other what is the other one doing what are you doing to the other one do you leave 
[03:49:30]  an egg as a christy novel in the bed that one can read well you're fucking well i'm not doing  anything to i'm having sex with one of with one of them there's no way you can satisfy two  girls at the same time well how would you do that you have a juggle two girls i think what it would  yeah i'd be having sex with the one the probably the blonde you mean you'd be having sexual intercourse  you would be putting your penis into her vagina and pumping vigorously how did this cock get out 
[03:50:00]  they take your cock out they were naked in bed well anthony skipped over i had to get him naked in bed  this is fucking preposterous yeah preposterous skip to that so so now you're you're banging one you're  crawled up on top and you're fucking just banging one right and then what do you do now the other  girl's laying there kind of looking laying there no what's she doing she moved up on top on top of  me she's sitting on your back wait what yeah you're fucking what she's laying on your back  while you're fucking the other one missionary style yeah is that not then why would you fuck with

[03:52:00]  way the other girl can be satisfied until you fuck her what else could you do use your imagination a  little bit i don't think so just use your imagination go wild what could you do with what's left your dick  it's being used my dick is being your dick is being fucking used occupado now what else could you use  to maybe make that girl feel good that's just kind of sitting there aside from her fucking playing

[04:00:00]  how much you got in you you can spread it around a little bit i think in my imagination when i'm ready  to you know to release myself yeah i'm ready to release myself i think i'm my my call it release  myself yeah release yeah yeah myself yeah yes yes so when i'm ready to release myself i think um  uh i my their mouths are both up to me oh so they're like they're doing that thing where they  both kneel in front of you yes in their mouths yes and their mouths are open yes mouth and then  you just kind of like little baby birds and yes and you feed them like baby not like that no 
[04:00:30]  but it's mouth yes that's what i choose in my fantasy fantasy ever yeah that's what i choose mouth  yeah you choose you choose but do they choose mouth i choose life they open their mouths or they like  they close it tightly my fantasy i tell them to take your what what what do you say i say open up  your mouth now for what jesus they know they'll know what do you say what do you say they don't  know open up it's time for aids yeah go ahead you think they don't know i think they realize all 
[04:01:00]  right but you say open your mouth and then what no i say i'm gonna come now open your mouth  and they say sorry open i'm yawning they don't say anything they're just moaning they're moaning  and they're really drunk and they're really horny so they just that was our audience so they just  really come up they just come up to me and they they kneel down they've opened their mouths up  and you're are you stroking your penis or are they doing it no i am right i am do you have to like 
[04:01:30]  collect collect your cum after you put it on their bodies no i'm not putting it on their bodies  because your religion don't you have to have to keep all that crack shot but i'm not putting  the cums on their bodies it's going right into their mouth it'll go somewhere though  what is david because what's going in there what's going in their mouth the cums is going  right into their mouth it's not going on their bodies the cums the cums the cums i didn't say that  did i yeah of course you did i didn't mean to the cums go in their mouth 
[04:02:00]  no it's not going on their bodies going right in their mouth how do you know you can't be that  crack of a shot  with the fucking...  Put it right up  to their mouth.  So what?  What are the tastes  about?  Well, while you're  switching over  from one to the other,  it's like when a  bartender lines up  a bunch of shot glasses  and just pours  over the top.  Someone's getting  on the bar.  Well, their mouth,  both their mouths  are directly up  to my cock,  so then I just  put it right into it.  I'm not, like,  pointing it anywhere else. 
[04:02:30]  Well, good.  Shouldn't point  that thing at anybody.  See, it's done  to destroy it.  You'll dump  half the cums  in the one girl's gullet  and then really quickly  you'll just turn  and fire hose  the other pig.  No, both their mouths  are right up to it  at the same time.  See, you can't get  both of them  at the same time  in the mouth  with one shot.  You're going to have to move.  You can't.  Why can't I?  Because it's like  fucking a fire hose  putting out a fire  with two windows.  You've got to aim your cock.  You've got to at some point,  you know,  move it around. 
[04:03:00]  There's a couple rooms burning.  Well, their mouths  are right...  One mouth is on one side  and one on the other side  and they're just right there  and they're right up to it  and they're doing it.  So you don't think  when you're swinging  from one mouth  to the other girl's mouth  they're not conjoined  twins joint  at the cheek, dummy.  You've got to  at some point  move your dick over  and during that  you might hit one  in the cheek.  That's right.  All right,  so I move it a little bit.  I'm aiming for their mouths.  I'm aiming for the mouth.  I know.  I've aimed for things  before too.  Sure. 
[04:03:30]  Hit me right in the eyeball.  I came on my ex-girlfriend's  cat jingles.  I did.  It came on a mouse  Mr. Jangles.  No, jingles was a cat  who was crippled  and I shot a load  off the bat  onto jingles' back.  Jingles.  You fucking bank shot it?  Jingles hated me.  Stupid jingles.  Let's go to the phones.  That fucking fantasy  story was better  than what he called.  Danny and Philly,  go ahead.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  David can't use his mouth  because he has to leave  a one-fifth distance  from the clip. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, yes.  Ah, the one-fist rule.  Right.  And let's go to Casey.  Casey.  Hey, what's going on?  I want to say  David's pussy  like a horse  eating a sugar cube  out of a child's hand.  Can we hear you  eating pussy again?  Yeah, let's do it  one more time.  All right.  Close your eyes.  No.  You can really get  into that pussy.  Go ahead.  Okay.  All right. 
[04:04:30]  You sound like  you're eating peanut butter  while you're drowning.  All right.  Why the...  Why the...  She was.  Why the...  Like eating spaghetti.  What's that about?  Yeah, yeah.  What's the slurping?  I don't know.  There's a lot  of slurping involved.  Yeah?  Why?  I don't know.  There's a lot of...  Because of the yeast infection?  Oh, he's sucking up  cottage cheese.  Yeah, I am.  I think so.  She's dropping muffins 
[04:05:00]  in his mouth.  I think so.  There's a lot of like...  There's a lot of like...  There's a lot of stuff  floating around.  Like juices floating around.  Oh, there you go.  Flotsam and jetsam?  Right.  There's stuff floating around.  Yeah.  There is.  All right.  All right, well.  That's a wonderful fantasy.  That's great.  There you go, guys.  That was for you out there.  Good job, David.  You're welcome.  David, you got everyone  all turned on.  That was some...  They've been...  They're shooting chism  in their trucks.  Now, once again,  I'd like to say  they're not booing  their yelling Jews.  Yes. 
[04:05:30]  So don't get confused.  They're not booing at you.  They loved it.  Right, guys?  You loved it, right?  No.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, David.  Wow.  David.  David, your sex story  was a little long.  Yes.  Fail.  I don't want it  to be too short.  Yeah, but you didn't  have to start with  my credit card  was declined  at the restaurant.  Oh, don't look  at the phones, David.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, don't look  at them.  Don't look at... 
[04:06:00]  Wow.  Worst one ever?  Daniel, you like  that story David told?  That has to be  the most boring fantasy  I've ever heard.  And you know  a fantasy, right?  You know how  to fantasize, right?  Heck yeah.  Wait, a fist away  from his mouth, please.  Yeah, fist away.  How would you  have changed  the story there?  No, I'd start up...  I'd walk in my room  and I'd find  these two broads  making out. 
[04:06:30]  Probably one of them  brown hair,  one of them blonde,  and probably the brown hair  one wearing the mini skirt.  And I'd just go  and I'd just start  making her out,  feeling her out,  pulling down that skirt.  and I'd just go  right there.  I'll just ram that...  He'd waste no time.  I'd go to the other one,  all right?  Yeah, see,  that's how you tell a story. 
[04:07:00]  He's ramming pussy.  I'd go to the other one.  She'd get it.  Actually, her,  she'd get it  up the fart box.  You can learn  a thing or two, David.  Go ahead, all right.  This guy knows.  Let him finish up.  This guy actually knows.  Go ahead, Daniel.  Finish up your fantasy.  They want it.  They'll get the jizz,  all right.  They'll get it  all over them.  I'm not aiming  for any specific. 
[04:07:30]  I'll just let it  all spray all over them.  That's silly string.  Let it all  spray all over them.  That's a story  right there.  Right?  That's actually pretty good.  He'll come in his hand  and chase him  and throw it at him.  Multiple Migs.  Daniel,  do you care  if they come?  That's even better.  If they come?  Yeah.  Yep.  How about if they die  while you're fucking them?  Do you finish up anyway? 
[04:08:00]  They passed away.  I'm dropping them.  I'm dropping them  in the East River.  Excellent.  All right.  He's got a plan.  He's coming from a man  who can stare at a leaf  until it turns brown.  They passed away  when I'm doing them.  I'm dropping them  in the East River  all jizzed face.  All right.  Jesus.  All right, Daniel.  Thank you.  All jizzed face.  Why are you dropping them  in the room?  What?  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[04:08:30]  Oh, my God.  That's great.  I think we've done  enough damage.  Yes, we certainly have.  He wasted no time  with his fantasy.  Yeah, and you wasted  everyone's.  I apologize for that,  but that's just how I am.  I don't want to be fast  and be over.  I like to enjoy myself  and take that time.  Get your money's worth.  Yes, I certainly do.  So, in his time,  he likes to go right at it  and do as fast as he can  so he can come right away.  That's his fantasy.  That's his business.  Yep.  People are asking  if David and Daniel  could do the last half hour  of the show for everybody, 
[04:09:00]  a little call-in show.  Oh, that would be fantastic.  A little David and Daniel.  Let them rock.  Want to do a little radio today, Daniel?  It is Friday.  Sure, no problem.  Come on over here  and sit in the big seat, huh?  Get in the big boy chair.  Wow, look at the applause  he got for his fantasy.  Ed, just shoving his cock  right in there.  No ifs, ands, or buts.  Dumping their fucking torsos  in the fucking river.  Oh, after he just sprays cum  like a fucking fire hose.  He doesn't care.  This is what we're going to do.  We're going to leave.  When we get back,  we go live till Rana Fez,  noon to three, 
[04:09:30]  and when we come back,  it'll be Daniel and David's  radio show.  There you go.  So call in with your fantasy.  Come on, David.  You look petrified.  You all right, David?  I am scared.  Why?  Oh, wait a minute.  Betty, Ed, you could use  the name that my sister  uses for me.  When she was young,  when she was younger,  she didn't know how to say  she didn't know how to say brother,  so she would always say Bobo,  so the name just stuck with me.  The Dave and Bobo show.  I like it.  You already got her 
[04:10:00]  fucking radio name.  Dude, this guy's blowing you away.  Why are you scared?  Hold on, Bobo.  Why are you scared, David?  She still calls me Bobo  to this day.  We got it.  David and Bobo up next.  David and Bobo show.  Wait, why are you scared?  What's wrong, David?  Yeah, David, you all right?  I guess I'll make it work.  Yeah.  What, David, we got?  I don't even know what you're saying.  Motherfucker, now I'm not going  anywhere until noon.  What did you do?  I gotta hear this.  I'm running to my truck.  Yeah.  Why are you scared, David?  All right, listen, we're gonna...  I don't know, I'm just scared.  I don't know what this guy 
[04:10:30]  would want to talk about  or what he's got.  That's radio.  That's what's the beauty of it.  Just fucking roll with it.  You guys gotta roll with it  right after the break.  Hopefully it's a quick break.  We're out of here.  Jimmy, you good?  Tower Theater tomorrow night  with Artie, as people know.  So come one, come all.  Very, very good.  FH Riley's tomorrow night.  I think a lot of us  are gonna be down there.  Yes.  My brothers joined 400  New York Avenue  in the heart of Huntington Village.  Yeah.  And thank you to the big audience. 
[04:11:00]  They're not going anywhere.  They want to listen  to the Dave and Bobo show,  which is next.  Have a good weekend.  All right, welcome  to the Dave and Bobo show,  the first ever edition.  I'm Dave and we're here with Bobo.  What's up, Bobo?  Everything's going great.  Everything's going great, David.  Thanks a lot, Bobo.  This is the first ever  edition of the show  and I want to get to know you  a little bit.  So first of all, you're Bobo. 
[04:11:30]  What gave you the name Bobo,  if I may ask?  My sister's been calling me that  since she was a baby  and it just stuck with me.  She still calls me that  to this day.  Well, why does she call you Bobo?  I mean, she could have picked  like dick face  or she could have picked  like clown or whatever.  Why does she call you Bobo?  Where does that come from?  I don't know.  When she was little,  that's how she said brother.  Brother means Bobo?  How does that work?  I have no idea.  If I could figure out  baby language,  I'd be a freaking genius.  Yeah, do you consider yourself  a genius there, Bobo? 
[04:12:00]  I don't know a genius,  but if I freaking knew  that language,  I'd be a freaking genius.  What language do you know, Bobo?  Yeah, the only language  I could speak is English.  You can't speak  any other languages?  Nope.  What about Bobo language?  That's the same as English.  Oh, that's the same as English, yeah?  Yeah, the phone number  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's right, Bobo.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  There you go.  So did you have  a pretty good relationship  there with your sister  back in the day? 
[04:12:30]  Yeah, she's only 13, so...  Oh, she's younger than you.  Yeah, she's younger than me.  All right, so how did she...  What made her  start calling you Bobo?  I was like,  she couldn't mention  any other name.  Like, why that name?  As I said before,  I have no idea.  That's how she said brother.  All right, I got you.  So do you hang out  with your sister a lot?  Are you too close?  I see her every so often.  She's going out a lot.  I don't know.  Are you going out a lot?  What are you going to do this week?  That's what I get to.  It's the weekend coming up,  you know, Bobo. 
[04:13:00]  So what are you going to do  this weekend?  Got any big plans, man?  What are you going to do?  What's your typical weekend, Bobo?  What are you going to do?  This weekend,  I might be heading out  to Long Island  to pay visit my cousin  as they do sometimes  on the weekend.  All right, hold on  in a minute, Bobo.  We're going to go  to the forums right now.  We've got Brooklyn Ace  on line, too.  Brooklyn Ace,  what's up, man?  Just out of curiosity, David,  first of all,  you're not a radio host.  You're maybe a backroom guy.  And are you going to ask Bobo  the same questions  I want to ask him  for the rest of the conversation? 
[04:13:30]  I'm just curious.  This is our first show  and I want to get  to know the co-host.  We just had this discussion.  We just listened to this.  Why do they call you Bobo?  Because my sister said that.  What do you open up with?  How come they call you Bobo?  Come on, David.  Well, I'm just curious.  I want to get to know the co-host.  I don't know the first thing  about this guy.  I'm interested.  I want to know him.  So I'm asking him  a bunch of questions.  You got a problem with that?  Why don't you come  and run the show  if you got a problem with it?  I could do a hell of a lot  better job than you could, David.  You think you could?  Anyone could.  Neo could.  Neo?  Oh, whatever.  Forget you.  Goodbye.  Okay, we got another caller. 
[04:14:00]  Victor on line three.  What's up, Victor?  How are you?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  What's up, man?  I cannot believe  they are giving you  valuable fucking air time.  This is unbelievable.  You are like a...  You're a dope, man.  I'll tell you what.  If you do midnight radio  for insomniacs,  you would be perfect.  How dare you?  That's not...  How dare you?  I'm off this caller.  Hang...  Yeah, hang up on that caller. 
[04:14:30]  Darn, yeah.  What do you think about this, Bob?  That's pretty rude  all about all these callers,  don't you think, man?  Yeah, it is.  We got Mitch on line eight.  Mitch, how...  How you doing?  Hello, Mitch?  You there, Mitch?  Hello, hello.  What's up, man?  Hello, David.  If you had a little  freaking radio presence,  maybe you know I was here.  I didn't even know  you came to me.  I didn't hear you.  You didn't hear Bobo?  He went to you.  So what's up, man?  Nothing much.  He's not saying  the goddamn word Bobo already.  We know his freaking name.  You suck. 
[04:15:00]  Good for you, man.  Goodbye.  All right.  So, Bobo,  what are your plans this weekend, man?  What are you going to do?  This weekend,  I'm going to visit my cousin.  I got...  Got a DVD box.  Got a Lost DVD box  that I've been trying  to get him into Lost  for quite a while.  Oh, you like the show Lost.  You're a big fan?  Do you watch every week,  every day, Lost,  when it's on every week?  Every week.  I've been seeing every episode  since the beginning.  Since the beginning?  Wow.  So you're a big fan.  What do you like about Lost?  Like, what do you like about that?  Do you think it's a good show, man? 
[04:15:30]  Yeah, it is.  It just makes you want to watch  the next episode.  Like, wish it was next week  right now.  All right.  Cool, man.  Hold on for a minute.  We got Matt on line three.  Yo, Matt, what's up, man?  Hey, Dave.  Yes, what's up, man?  Besides proceeded.  He proceeded to.  Then I proceeded to.  Okay, so why don't you  come on the show  and you say whatever  you want to say.  Then he proceeded to.  Good for you, man.  Then I proceeded to.  Then she proceeded to.  Then I proceeded to.  Yes, you proceeded  to do a lot of things, yes.  But you didn't proceed to.  Yeah, I'm fucking thesaurus, Matt.  Did you proceed 
[04:16:00]  to host this radio show?  I'm thesaurus.  Did you proceed  to host this radio show, Matt?  I don't think so, no.  Did you proceed  to answer my question?  No, I didn't proceed  to answer your question, no.  Can you please proceed  to go fuck yourself?  No, I can't proceed  to go fuck myself.  I can proceed to.  I can proceed  to have you go fuck yourself.  Bobo, let me interject here, Bobo.  What do you think  about this, Bobo?  What do you think  about this caller, huh?  That sounds like  something on that.  Then he proceeded to.  Sounds like that.  Then I proceeded to. 
[04:16:30]  Shut up, man.  What do you.  Yeah, continue, Bobo.  I proceeded to proceed.  I have on this guy already.  Good enough  for this guy, Matt.  Bobo, what are your thoughts  about this?  Then I proceed  to proceed some more.  Let the dude  get a word in, all right?  Let the kid talk  for a minute.  Come on, now.  Bobo, what do you think?  You can not proceed anymore.  You know what?  I'll proceed to.  If you don't shut up,  I'll proceed to hang up on you.  You proceed to take it.  Yes, I do.  Bobo, what do you think 
[04:17:00]  about all these callers  and making fun of me  and saying proceed, Bobo?  It sounds like  this sounds like  that WABC guy,  that guy in WABC  that goes,  Yeah, I proceeded  to say that.  Wait, Bobo,  what ABC guy is this?  I'm not familiar  with this guy.  I don't remember  the name of this guy,  but this guy  would always like,  yo, get the F  off my phones.  Was it on radio  or was it on TV?  What was this?  It was on radio.  I forgot the name  of this guy.  That's all right.  One moment there, Bobo.  We got Dave  on line seven.  Dave, what's up, man? 
[04:17:30]  Hello, Dave?  Dave, you're on.  Hey, Dave, how you doing?  Yes, hey, what's up, man?  You know a fucking monkey  with a pencil  could do your job  as you proceed  to do and ask  the same fucking questions?  Good for you, man.  Good for you, man.  Good for you.  Proceed, proceed.  Yeah, good for you, man.  All right.  So, Bobo,  what are you telling me  about this guy  on ABC radio?  This guy would just go  if he felt like it.  He just, 
[04:18:00]  if the guy didn't,  if the person  didn't agree with him,  he'd just, like,  go and yell, like,  get off my phones.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, he would.  I forgot the name  of this guy,  but the guy,  the guy.  Was that one  of your favorite  radio personalities  back in the day?  You listen to him  all the time?  I don't know  if he was my favorite,  but.  Who was your favorite  radio personality?  Do you have any  favorite radio shows  you always listen to?  I don't know.  I used to,  back in the day,  I would,  of course,  I would listen to  Mike and the Mad Dog  in the afternoons.  Oh, Mike and the Mad Dog? 
[04:18:30]  You can see him.  I'm a huge Mets fan.  I see that.  You got a big Mets cap  on that.  Your favorite baseball  team there, the Mets?  Yep, been a Mets fan  for years.  All right,  one moment there, Bobo.  We got Kevin on line one.  Kevin, what's up, man?  The phones are ringing  off the hook.  Wow, Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  I'm Bobo.  I want to hear  what it sounds like  when you two guys  are eating pussy together.  You got two girls,  just the two of you.  You got a little orgy going on.  Playing some kissy face  on some pussy.  I want to hear  what it sounds like 
[04:19:00]  Bobo, you got that?  Well, there's one thing  I'd like to say.  Ask and you shall receive.  All right, great.  Let's hear it.  What you doing there, Bobo?  What's that voice  you're doing there?  That's your voice there?  Your voice for kissing a girl  or making out with a girl?  Is it a mic?  Is it pussy a microphone?  Yeah, that's pretty much  the sound of it.  Okay, cool, Bobo.  Dude, keep going.  Keep going.  Make the noise.  Make the noise.  Okay, I'd do that too, yeah. 
[04:19:30]  Da-da-da.  Whoa, Bobo,  that's how you get in?  You get in there  with all that.  Would you be giggling, though?  No, I don't think  I'd be giggling.  I heard a little giggling  in your voice.  How would you be  interacting with that girl?  I want to hear it, David.  It's making my dick hard.  Oh, no, Bobo.  That's kind of sick, Bobo.  What do you think about that?  Making the guy's dick hard.  Isn't that sick, Bobo?  Does that turn you on?  Does that turn you on?  A male caller  is getting his dick hard.  Does that turn you on there, Bobo?  No, that would make me puke. 
[04:20:00]  Puke?  Why would you puke?  You don't like that?  That's not comfortable for you?  I have no idea  why the heck the guy  would get his dick hard  by the sound of that.  What is comfortable for you, Bobo?  What is comfortable for you?  Bobo, what is comfortable for you?  If that's not turning you on,  what would?  A simple, a good porn film.  Oh, a good porn film. 
[04:20:30]  Okay, hold on there, man.  We got Mike on 912.  Yo, Mike, what's up, man?  Hey, why don't you...  You're supposed to have a co-host there.  It's a fucking co-host.  You're not interviewing  the guy that's supposed to be your co-host.  You're fucking talking to  Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo,  like you're interviewing him.  Talk about something.  Get a fucking subject  and didn't fucking talk about it.  You don't know how to  carry on a conversation. 
[04:21:00]  This is Bobo we're talking...  This is Bobo we're talking about here.  This is Bobo we're talking...  You don't fucking retard.  You don't fucking...  Hey, Bobo, what do you think about...  Bobo, what do you think about  the microphone for your face?  Bobo, what do you think about  this is...  What do you think about  fucking shitting?  This is Bobo we're talking with here.  Pick a topic  and fucking talk  to the guy about it.  You think so?  Why don't you host a show  with Bobo, alright? And then you see  what you can talk about with him, alright?  Alright? Yeah, I thought so. You hung up, huh? 
[04:21:30]  That's right. That's what I thought, man.  Great. Good for you.  I don't know. These callers are being  really ridiculous. Bobo, what do you think about these callers,  huh? They're being pretty ridiculous.  They're being  pretty ridiculous, alright, but I have to  admit, though, that does make interesting radio  hearing these guys. Alright, so, okay.  Okay, fine. So, you want to talk about a topic?  Do you have any topics you're interested in, Bobo? How about  Rihanna? Rihanna's on the front page  of the cover of the New York Post.  You heard about this whole story, though? 
[04:22:00]  Rihanna and Chris Brown?  Yeah, I heard about it, alright.  I heard about it, alright.  I haven't seen any photos of  yet, but I could imagine...  Yeah, I looked at the newspaper. She's right on the top of the corner.  This guy, Chris Brown, brutally...  They were dating. You know who they are, right?  First of all, you know who they are, right, Bobo?  Of course I know who they are.  They're big R&B stars, R&B, R&B, rap, pop stars.  They're big stars, big singers,  and they're dating, and Rihanna  is getting brutally beaten up  by Chris Brown. She's taken it from me. 
[04:22:30]  Look at all this... I mean, you've seen all the scars  and bruises on the face of Rihanna. What do you think about all this?  I think this is terrible.  This is the wrong way to go.  How are they going to get far in life or have a relation?  It's just... This is bad for the music industry,  I personally think. What do you think about all this?  Yeah, it is.  To me, it amazes me they're still dating.  She must really like an ass-kicking  if she's still going with him.  You think so?  Yeah, Bobo, if I may ask before that,  you know Mike, the guy that just called before.  What do you think about this guy, Mike, that just called before?  If I may ask, real quick.  I'm sorry to interject about the Rihanna story, 
[04:23:00]  but real quick.  I think a lot of people are just getting used to this  because this is just a new thing  that they're just hearing this.  After all, this is the first show.  Right.  This is the debut, so of course...  Right, so...  But did you think he was like a real asshole?  And you think he was like a real asshole?  I think that guy was a personal asshole.  Like, he's ruining our show  and making fun of our show like this.  That fucking idiot asshole  was ruining our show and saying rude things,  telling us how to run our show.  This is the Dave and Bobo show. 
[04:23:30]  Come on.  Come on, Bobo.  You gotta have some stuff about him.  What do you want to do to...  If Mike for some...  Pretend Mike was in the studio right now.  What would you want to do to him right now?  He was rude and made fun of your show  and was trying to tell you what to do.  What would you want to do to him right now?  What he said to you on the show.  What would you want to do to him, Bobo?  I'd say...  Ramon!  Somebody...  Somebody get...  That's what you would do?  Wouldn't you take a fist  and knock it to his head  and beat him up  and fucking punch him out  and beat the shit out of that guy  for all of what he said to you? 
[04:24:00]  Heck yeah.  I'd probably go...  I'd probably knock the guy out after.  You knocked the guy out?  But what was that before?  What was that noise you were making before?  Come on.  You wouldn't just go there and make noises.  You'd fucking punch him in the mouth.  You'd beat him up.  You'd knock him down.  You'd bust him out.  You'd send him to the hospital.  You'd want to kill that guy, wouldn't you?  He was rude.  On your debut of the show,  you had a rude collar like that.  That's pretty rude, man.  If I admit that,  I'd want him to look like a UFC victim.  A UFC victim?  There you go, man.  You'd kick him in the cunt,  wouldn't you, Bobo?  I know I would kick that guy in the cunt. 
[04:24:30]  I think I'd go one step further.  I think I'd bring out the old flamethrower.  The old flamethrower?  Yeah, I'd fuck that guy in his mouth,  wouldn't you?  I don't know about that, but...  You wouldn't do that, Bobo?  I think I'd probably bring out the...  the whole rocket launcher on the guy.  That's what you'd do?  Yeah, I'd bring out the rocket launcher.  All right,  these collars are getting pretty brutal  with us for the first entire show.  That's over? 
[04:25:00]  That guy's been pretty brutal  for the first entire show.  You know, Bobo?  Yep, I know what you mean.  Looks like we got the Mary Brothers music.  We gotta finish up.  Yeah, we definitely do gotta finish up.  Well, Bobo was a good first show.  I enjoyed it.  So, once again,  this has been the Dave and Bobo Show.  Have a good weekend, everybody.  Goodbye, guys.  Bobo?  Bobo, say goodbye to the collars.  All right.  Bye, collars. </pre>
