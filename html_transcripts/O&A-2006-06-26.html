<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments.  It began with the hosts discussing a lavish food buffet provided by WBCN in Boston and The Palm restaurant in New York, alongside boasting about high ratings in Cleveland and their triumphant return to WJFK in Washington D.C., accompanied by positive press from various major news outlets.  Opie then launched into a graphic description of his ongoing mouse infestation, culminating in the horrifying discovery of a maggot-infested dead mouse in a trap, detailing the smell and the subsequent cleanup.  Meanwhile, Anthony lamented the chaos caused by his houseguests – a married couple and their three children – detailing the destruction they wrought on his recently renovated home, including a scratched floor and a clogged toilet, and his strategies for avoiding them.  Numerous callers contributed to the discussion, adding their perspectives on both the maggot incident and Anthony's domestic woes.

Guest Jimmy discussed his experience on HBO's "Lucky Louie," including the unexpected placement of a male nudity scene, and recounted several minor run-ins with police officers during Gay Pride week, sparking a debate with callers and the hosts regarding appropriate conduct towards law enforcement. The segment concluded with a promotion for a listener contest to win an iMac and further mocking of WBCN’s "Man Town" promotion, playing several listener-submitted audio pieces satirizing it.

A significant portion of the show focused on listener-submitted audio clips, heavily critiquing their comedic merit and production quality.  Danny, a contributor, participated in the humorous, often crude and offensive, banter surrounding the submissions, with "Man Town" serving as a recurring joke.  The conversation then dramatically shifted to global warming, with varied perspectives from callers, news clips, and even a homeless man's comedic take on the subject.  The hosts displayed a range of attitudes towards the issue, from skepticism to outright dismissal, interspersed with sarcastic remarks and jokes, and mentioned Al Gore and Stephen Hawking.  A lawsuit regarding a malfunctioning penile implant was discussed with graphic and comedic detail.  The segment concluded with commentary on Logo TV, punctuated by crude jokes and observations on gay culture, promotion of "The Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus" comedy tour, and mentions of sponsors and giveaways.

The show then transitioned to a segment recorded outside their old studio, interacting with fans, including "Alex from New Hampshire," known for his adult website reviews.  They discussed an upcoming appearance in the Washington Post and an invitation to a Derek Jeter charity dinner, where Opie planned to bring his date, "Roland," a photographer, despite a no-photography rule.  Concerns about Opie's lack of a suitable suit were expressed. The show included listener calls and audio clips from a Gay Pride parade, featuring interviews riddled with sexually explicit and offensive language, discussing various aspects of gay identity and experiences. A video from the Golden Nugget casino showing a shooting incident involving Black people prompted a controversial discussion about gun control and racial stereotypes. Other topics included Warren Buffett's donation to the Gates Foundation, Jim Norton's stolen jokes, smoothies and fruits, and a “bit court” segment settling comedian disputes, mentioning E-Rock and Norm Macdonald.  The hosts then revealed and mocked a competing "Opie and Anthony" show airing concurrently on a different station.  Jim Gaffigan was mentioned as an in-studio guest, although specifics of his appearance were not fully detailed in this excerpt.


A substantial segment focused on a competing radio show in Washington D.C., which the hosts believed was imitating their style.  The hosts, using homophobic slurs and other offensive language,  played audio clips highlighting perceived similarities and took calls from listeners confirming their observations.  Chris from D.C. called in to confront them about previously mocking midday radio hosts, only to be met with further insults.  Comedian Jim Gaffigan joined the show in studio, initially promoting his movie, *The Great New Wonderful*, but the conversation quickly branched out into discussions about his commercials, physical strength, and gym experiences, then back to the D.C. radio show and listener calls.  A lengthy, argumentative call with No Filter Paul, regarding a stingy tipping incident at Opie's brother Brett's restaurant, FH Riley's, ensued, involving further arguments and offensive remarks from all participants. The segment concluded with a brief return to Gaffigan's movie before the broadcast ended.


The final excerpt featured a continued conversation with Jim Gaffigan, who discussed his role as a "pedophile clown" on *Law & Order: SVU*, comparing the filming and audition processes.  The conversation also involved a comparison of SAG and AFTRA health insurance, with negative opinions from all participants.  A caller from Indiana briefly contributed.  A major portion was dedicated to recounting past "radio wars," detailing a long-standing feud with Don and Mike, along with conflicts with Tom Likas and Star, describing the experience as akin to professional wrestling and detailing listener involvement in antagonizing other radio shows.  Audio clips from Don and Mike were played, highlighting their past conflict and upcoming return to the same station. The hosts criticized the poor audio quality of some clips. The discussion also touched upon the firing of Opie and Anthony from CBS, suggesting management was at fault. The episode concluded with promotion of an upcoming party, discussion of Gaffigan's film and tour, announcement of Def Leppard as the next guest, and a disturbing final listener call.

[00:07:00]  it was thursday or friday and they're back the mice are back for some reason i've caught in three or  four and then i was sweeping up the backyard yesterday and there's a there was a drowning  mouse just wandering around the uh the outdoor space just completely covered in gook from all  the rain we've had not doing well whatsoever you know the diseases that can come off of these things  opie well it's now you're living in like bubonic plague uh era uh environment well now it's on my uh 
[00:07:30]  my broom so you gotta throw the broom away the fella you gotta throw the whole place away the fella  how to die the little fella what'd you do what'd you do did you smash him with a broom  bam a little fat wet mouse oh god it was a drenched mouse just wandering around it wasn't doing well  so that was uh i guess that was number four mercy killing i guess that was number four within the last  week and if you've been keeping track at home i've killed probably i'm i'm serious well over 20  well over 20 through the electric traps mostly so uh remember on thursday or friday i was telling you 
[00:08:00]  like i came up with a new concoction it was like peanut butter and cheese peanut butter and cheese  works great on the traps right what you were saying yeah and the cheese it was uh it was out in one of  the traps for a couple weeks so it was starting to kind of kind of kind of get a little gamey  pretty stinky just a little gamey right yeah and uh i noticed on i guess friday after the show that  was getting really gamey in the kitchen i mean really gamey i'm like man that doesn't smell like 
[00:08:30]  uh a little cheese that you might have left out gamey that is really a disgusting term  there's an electric uh trap like under a counter and you you look for the blinking light when you got  one this little light blinks it blinks like every four or five seconds to tell you there's something in  the trap okay because it's so creepy to open those things up to see if you got anything so the light  will tell you and then you just have to open up the trap and empty it and it's it's easy cleanup i 
[00:09:00]  mean these traps are amazing i would love to give the guy another plug electrocution so the kitchen was  uh a little gamey and i closed it off from the rest of the apartment so the ac could you know work  better that's a good solution what just close it off and turn the ac up well the gamey the gamey went  from just a little bit like a little oh what's that something's a little off yeah to what the hell  is that so i look under the counter again i'm like the trap's not blinking there's nothing in there 
[00:09:30]  right so you depended solely on the light on the trap to tell you if you had a mouse yes  no visual inspection not for the most part no for the most part no okay no continue so then uh  so then all of a sudden i also noticed on friday i'm like man i've noticed lately there's uh there's  a bunch of flies flying around in this apartment oh ew swear to god and i'm like i haven't really 
[00:10:00]  opened up the windows any you know uh recently because it's been so muggy and hot in new york  that i uh that i had the ac cranked right so no reason to have windows open where maybe a fly  could fly in but i'm noticing like man there's two or three flies in the living room what's this about  how they're getting in here and then the gamey smell in the in the kitchen that drastically went  up on friday so i look under the counter again i'm like man it's just not blinking but maybe i  should check this smells like gacy's basement right maybe i should check this trap you know 
[00:10:30]  at least get rid of the smell may i you know i got to get rid of the this peanut butter cheese  thing i've been yeah because that must be it a little dab how big was it the size of a dime  yeah pretty much dab of that sure it's stinking your whole house up so that's the only reason i  picked up the trap off the floor going i gotta you know get rid of the this cheese smell that's all  i'm thinking yeah this flies in the living room like this is weird man dude i opened up the trap  and started dry heaving immediately just thinking about it right now i i i might have to run to the 
[00:11:00]  bathroom and dry heaving again in the trap oh it just got me as i was ready to say it was a dead  mouse yeah that i figured that much yeah that i did not see because the stupid light wasn't blinking  maybe maybe the battery went dead in the thing because it fried it so bad um the belly was completely  open and maggots like i've never seen before maggots like i've never seen before i mean quick guess 
[00:11:30]  at least a hundred hundred maggots just just going to town on this mountain crawling through its open  belly wound crawling like like i've never seen crawling before i started dry heaving and screaming  like a little freaking girl to be honest with you running around the apartment like oh my god oh my god  oh my god oh my god i had to cover my mouth like it was some kind of crime scene  to to get rid of this thing to put vaseline or uh vix you put vix under your nose i was just 
[00:12:00]  spraying like the uh crime investigators i was spraying lysol on like a like a towel or whatever  and just you know doing that it was it was horrific it was horrific throw the whole trap out  absolutely now you're one electric trap down yeah i know now they're mice are gonna get a foothold  on you because they know when they've sacrificed one of their own to get rid of a piece of your  artillery i need more more electric traps but it was the worst worst scene one of the worst scenes 
[00:12:30]  i've ever seen in my life you have to smell i i you gotta leave the establishment i uh i i'm putting  a bin in a place today we'll see what happens oh we'll see what happens 20 30 bucks yeah a little  more than that could be a little more than that a little higher than that anthony look i understand i gotta  get out i i understand that yeah i'm trying trust me i'm trying i i've looked at like you're living in  like crazy leather faces house or something like a horror movie you have rotting flesh in your 
[00:13:00]  rotting flesh right there in your kitchen but it went from like it went from a tiny little smell like  what what is that to oh my god what is going on that's the fun of death you have it's slow rot  mice roaches maggots and flies you are flies are gone maggots are gone dead mouse is gone  apartment smells uh like roses right now oh it does and and i don't really see i see a cockroach  every once in a while don't matter one is you guys have been there it is a nice place it's just a great

[00:18:30]  some music that's great through the whole thing i like that so then it goes into like a stanley kubrick  ai just dreamy weird you know time thing yeah and then uh and then the movie should should end  well i don't want to give it away but it should end at this this point where you would leave the  theater really sad like oh that was pretty effed up yeah and then they they bring it back they have  to make it fun to make it all fun and happy at the end because hollywood uh needs those happy endings  yeah i heard it was kind of like a it's a wonderful life kind of thing yeah and uh yeah the concept 
[00:19:00]  was interesting you know christopher walken's in it he's pretty funny who hasn't thought of that  concept though i have like the whole concept thing i i saw adam sandler on the the daily show  this was on the other day or something and uh john stewart had said you know who hadn't come up  with this concept when you're just stoned with your friends imagine if the remote like worked  everything and you can like pause yeah that's stoner talk we all we've all had that so they decided to 
[00:19:30]  make a movie out of it and then they kind of added in uh this uh dramatic kind of like really dramatic  angle like you gotta be kidding me is he going for an oscar stop i hate when they do stop right now  either that or on a tv show when they're going for an emmy moment yeah you're a goofy comedian  that makes you know subpar movies just continue down that road anytime a comedian is doing some  kind of like drama or crying on a sitcom on a sitcom on a dramatic show on tv they're absolutely 
[00:20:00]  thinking emmy absolutely and in a movie it's got to be oscar god gotta be nominated for this  playing a retard is another thing that'll get you uh the thing going in your head any uh aspirations  from um an award like that jimmy because i know you're a comic you're doing television now  anything do you do you have like a dream in your head about oscar speech emmy even well i do briefly  get to play a retarded person oh yeah yeah this oh yeah yeah i make fun of the retarded make fun of 
[00:20:30]  because that's in essence is exactly what it is when a person of normal intellect is on television  or a movie playing a retarded person what you're doing is making fun of them but for some reason if  it's on film it's accepted and uh award you get award awards for it yes and fat women like linda  stacy you think it's terrific that stupid shot with her that severed hand holding her face in the

[00:27:30]  where they're kind of doing this big reconstruction and they break down these little houses from the  50s and they take the lot or maybe two lots together now and build a bigger house or in your  case a whole block it looks like it looks like these houses have been dropped by parachute into these  neighborhoods because they kind of like don't fit right but then as they knock down more little  houses and build more big houses it becomes a very nice affluent community so i live around uh  you know they're all jewish people i'm i'm the only catholic like i think on the whole uh neighborhood 
[00:28:00]  and i like that jewish people take care of their houses certainly do wonderful uh but uh  now i have a house a house guest um i have okay uh married couple uh jen and buddy they're the  parents of the kids uh how many kids anthony uh christopher who's my godson and vincent  there are five i believe like three four-ish and then uh like two-ish one one and something-ish 
[00:28:30]  you know good age how many kids there's three oh three good age you have running around the brand new  house oh jeez i'm sure they're not uh scratching anything nah they don't the kids know nah now just  last um just last week i'm listening to a replay about about the couch that i have in my reading room  which has a nice wood floor and they call this wood floor it's like a one wood floor it's got no knots  in it or anything nice because sometimes you see wood floors there's knots in it and imperfections 
[00:29:00]  this is all oak wood floor not a not to be found not even in the closets i'd like that so there's a  couch and an ottoman in there that never moves and i i hadn't put on the little teflon booties on the  bottom of the wooden uh and metal uh things on the ottoman yet someone slides on the wood floor  so last week i was listening to the best of with uh jimmy going oh you're done that's gonna be so  scratched up and i go no i'm watching the ottoman to make sure well apparently one of the children 
[00:29:30]  had used it as some type of walker um in the room and was just kind of walking and hanging on to it as  all along the wood floor there it was just gouges in uh in the wood floor he's working a ouija board  a big oak ouija board i'm just horrified but but like what i think i've reached the the point where 
[00:30:00]  i'm just like destroy it i know i have to fix it once they're gone i what am i gonna do as a and i'm  the worst like that's why i'm not a parent that's why i'm not i don't know how to work these kids i  don't know where the off button is to me i swear to you i've started to think how much time could 
[00:30:30]  they possibly how much time could they possibly give me for for murder it's like what 20 years  here's the off switch by the way is that it well you know something it's not in the old days that  was the off switch but nowadays it's called a time i can't hit first of all hey you get a time i can't  hit other people's kids yeah and it's time out and stuff it's time out hitting is uh hitting's fine  i think it's fine a lot of people still think it's fine but it's a no-no out like their father 
[00:31:00]  now it's a it's called a time out their father buddy's hysterical because like he's italian i  kind of remember growing up and hearing this he threatens them with like you touch anything i cut  off your hands and the kids are petrified kid came in with like dirty feet one day and he goes  come here i'm gonna cut your feet off and the kid's like no like runs away from his father  because he thinks he's gonna cut his feet off it is the funniest damn thing to see i love when kids  are either horrified or crying i don't know what it makes me smile like i heard last night i'm finally 
[00:31:30]  trying to go to sleep and i hear um one of the kids was doing something so uh uh the the mother  uh gave him a little whack and i hear the kid in the other room like yeah crying and i just got this  big smile and i said to my girlfriend i go i don't know why i get such pleasure in hearing  children crying because they're upset or in some type of pain i think it's because of the damage 
[00:32:00]  report on my house now we got the wood floor all scraped up and then i go into the my my my powder  room which is um kind of off the kitchen very very convenient uh bathroom to have right there  first floor got a couple of them on the first floor it's nice but that's it's a bathroom it's  not a no it's a powder room do you know every fixture in there the vanity is like furniture it's  not just like this little thing it's furniture in there it's a wonderful little thing to tile 
[00:32:30]  all handling it's beautiful anyway uh i go in i go to blow my nose i throw the tissue in the toilet  and flush and have that horror feeling as you see the water's not going down it's climbing  climbing toward the edge of the toilet so i dive underneath the bowl and and now it's a race  between the water level and that little oval silver handle on the little pipe to shut it off  because if you could get that turned off quickly enough the water stopped oh so i finally got right 
[00:33:00]  shut off right before it's going down and i look and i don't know i see something poking out but  something had been flushed down the toilet i don't know what it is could be a big heavy piece of paper  towel could be uh an action figure from the latest pixar movie cars i have no idea what it is could be  your dreams of a nice home my dreams of a nice home flushed right down the toilet all i know is i came 
[00:33:30]  downstairs my house i've had it for probably a month and a half months maybe two months something  like that and i come downstairs turn on the light and see like some type of like in some type of  bodega an out of order sign on my bathroom downstairs out of order out of order  do you know i have to open up my beautiful stainless steel refrigerator i have to open it up 
[00:34:00]  with the handle as above my head i have to hold the last like four inches of handle because the  handle runs the entire length of the door it's one of those um uh like what the hell's the name of it  sub-zero thank you thank you than than knows his appliances big stainless steel sub-zero  and i can't touch the handle because it is it is encapsulated in various forms of food 
[00:34:30]  yogurt and jelly and and so you don't mind germs you mind goo goo you mind sticky things like that  get me crazy sticky gets me crazy and then i walk into uh one of the bathrooms and and i go i go to  you know do what i do in there and i'm going what i smell a i smell a baby i smelled baby smell  it was a diaper it was in the little little tiny little for your tissues garbage pail in in the bathroom

[00:45:00]  whole week a whole week in manhattan boy i wasn't paying attention to that so well this was not it  well yeah i didn't know you had a program and everything i know i didn't know it was a week of  activities week of fun saturday when i'm driving to the village to try to do my sets uh they're blocking  off these weren't the cops these were uh these scumbag uh traffic people who are not all right  they're not real cops they dress them like cops just so you don't spit on them when you drive by  yeah but i'm like going down greenwich and i want to cut over to mcdougal and i see the guy i go look 
[00:45:30]  and i know no one can come through here i'm like look i'm a comedian i'm working at the comedy  cellar i've had this happen a couple of times over the years where they won't let you in  but they know you're an employee you're going down there to work they just don't want through traffic  going through real cops always let you through yeah come on this what do they call them the people  what are they called kenny the traffic guards exactly traffic these these faggoty crossing guards 
[00:46:00]  yeah which is pretty much what they are crossing guards that have the power to write tickets  wouldn't let me in i'm like dude i'm working down here i'm sorry sir i'm sorry sir so i go up one  more and i see a guy and i ask him to and he's another he's another non-cop yeah un-cop and he's  like nope can't let you and i'm like dude i'm not bsing you man i'm working down here i'm an employee  i'm not here to hang out i have a garage i park in right here you know i can't let you can't let you  and i just i go you're not a real cop are you you're not a real cop and he goes uh yes i am i'm 
[00:46:30]  a police officer i'm an officer with the traffic division oh shut up you're not a cop stupid  so i finally uh park on sixth avenue as i'm walking by this guy again i i've never wanted to attack a  guy in a uniform before but i mumble you're not a real cop sea sucker and i mumble it i start turning  around looking at him he's staring at me and i realize here's the decision you have to make right  now you're not a good fighter yeah he probably is he probably knows that much you'll never win this 
[00:47:00]  there's nothing you can do here so i walked for half a block and i kept turning around and i know  he wanted me to come back and say something to him uh but then again he might have thought i was  going to attack him i really really i know i avoided jail by continually walking i know i did yeah uh  yeah because i hate them by the way if that's what you do for a living if you're one of those  little ticket writers you're not good enough to be a cop you're never going to be a cop that's why 
[00:47:30]  you try to exercise your power so much crap now on to last night as i'm driving home 66th street  i don't know what precinct this is there's an ambulance stopped off to the side so i'm driving  with my friend and there's a car stopped in the middle of the street the car's driving he sees  the ambulance there's two cops there he stops in the middle of the street and starts  rubbernecking this ambulance thing oh boy he stopped and he's looking to the left so i give  a little beep and i mean i saw the cops there i didn't blare on the horn it was this beep it was 
[00:48:00]  hey hey hey hey like god let's go yeah no stopping to look so the guy the guy uh the guy drives away  and and stupid whatever precinct that is cop well i see him strutting up and i'm like here it comes a  problem so i roll down the window and he goes uh you know you beeped at that guy uh he was just  slowing down to make sure nobody was jumping out of the ambulance oh he was was he is that what he 
[00:48:30]  was doing you horse's ass of course i didn't say that i said uh no i said no i know buddy i just  who was a little bit he goes oh no no it's officer not buddy is it  it's officer not buddy really how's douche is that acceptable how about that well you should have  addressed him by his proper title that's a courtesy you extend it's not an official title that is 
[00:49:00]  you're legally bound to to address anybody and do it was when you go into court do you call the judge  hey pal hey pally no there's a difference because you're you're already you don't you don't know  i don't okay it was such a casual thing he i was being very polite and he knew i was being polite  i wasn't going i wasn't like this hey buddy buddy right nothing like that it was i'm sorry buddy i  just you know the guy was ahead i just i would you give me the demo of this uh cop uh look like a 
[00:49:30]  white guy um in his 20s he was probably on a demo either him or his partner must be familiar with  the show 66th street last night like around 11 30 there was an ambulance call on 66th around there  in broadway so if you know who this cop was it's officer not buddy you didn't look at his name tag  no i didn't want it for one i mean he didn't do anything wrong you know then you could just kind  of make fun of him for whatever ethnic background he is when you drive away it makes you feel better  i would that but then i knew what i'm gonna do he could obviously give me a ticket for beeping the 
[00:50:00]  horn i mean please no i mean once you're you're driven away then you can call them whatever you  want but i was embarrassed for comfort of your own home it's like well dude like you knew the tone  i was coming at you with you're not stupid yeah you knew it and uh just to throw that out there  was really well maybe there was some maybe he saw something a little injured child perhaps and it  got him a little you know no maybe he's a little on edge yeah he saw me beeping i was on the upper  west side he thought i was probably one of these upper west side snot i just want to say what i'm 
[00:50:30]  trying to get to here i love it yeah as far as the nypd goes i have never had a problem with them  they support this program we support them all i know is wholeheartedly they protect us every single  day every day this studio go to the other studio i love the nypd they don't make enough money  mike cole in the back of the uh studio and perhaps hi pal perhaps one of the reasons is they don't  make enough money uh they're always being denied the raises that they so duly deserve in this city 
[00:51:00]  uh having to uh uh wrangle animals on a daily basis these officers of the law that put their lives on  the line for us on a daily basis i salute you i respect you i address you as officer regardless of  the situation friendly unfriendly um if they know me if they don't know me they will receive the same  respect because i respect the uniform and the work that went into getting that uniform not so much the 
[00:51:30]  man behind it as it is the institution the people keeping us safe in this city oh a little  inconvenience that jimmy couldn't get past the ambulance a second or two earlier an old benny  horn beeper had to just go and upset everybody now when an officer comes over and does his job  because you're not supposed to beep in this city all of a sudden he's the bad guy well jimmy 
[00:52:00]  shame on you shame on you thank you excuse me excuse me it's radio guy not jimmy  i'm sorry you douche all right hold on let's say hi to tom tom what's going on  kenny kenny very anxious to make his relax kenny we'll get to you in a second i'm sorry kenny  yeah tom what's up well like i said uh i told you greener i'm a police officer uh yes officer 
[00:52:30]  i'm a police officer in the county where big shot lives and on the north shore and uh regardless of  what type of situation you come into with a police officer you need to be respectful and buddy  regardless of how you're how nice you are is not respectful oh stop it it is so i know how to i i have  i've never in my life had a problem with the cops i support them completely on this show i always do  and and if you and buddy is not respectful yes it is he didn't come up and go excuse me sir 
[00:53:00]  it was casual he walked over you made a beep an oar and i'm sorry buddy i just was you know that's  the i'm sorry i'm a 37 year old man it wasn't a confrontation between me and this guy i was admitting  that he was right i was whenever you come in contact with the police officer whether he is casual or not  you know you need to be respectful i mean that's how i was growing up before i even became a police  officer and that's just i've corrected people by calling me buddy i don't appreciate being called 
[00:53:30]  buddy yeah really well dude i understand that but that to me is a complete show of arrogance because  he knew again if i was being a smart ass going hey sorry buddy then i understand that point because  he's going well wait a minute don't get out of line but he knew the tone and don't say the tone  doesn't matter it does matter it absolutely matters because if i'm being a snot and still  calling him officer well then does that make my being respectful just because i used the word  officer he knew the dude he knew the tone i was coming with you know you're a civilian and you don't 
[00:54:00]  understand but i you know i understand maybe your point of view but being on the other side when you  have people speak to you i mean granted when we work in nassau county where where big shot lives on  the gold coast over there hey big shot i'm the guy that backs you guys up and so do i all the time  sir and so do i all the time that one pompous ass and sir we're a big shot lives uh we take care of  our residents very well thank you sir all right thank you thank you sir we got your point let's go to 
[00:54:30]  gasper from the nypd gasper make it fast please hey how you doing uh guys just wanted to let you know  i think what uh jimmy ran into here was uh our rookies just got out of the academy so uh he  probably ran into one of these guys it's his first day out and he's going to save the world  oh maybe he was uh happy to be there and uh you never know but i mean i've talked to enough cops  to know i've called them buddy before it's like they understand exactly what the situation is and  the tone that's why when i asked him to drive through once in a while if there's a cop guardian 
[00:55:00]  he'll let you because they're comfortable making that decision like yeah go ahead cut through i know  you're working down here right we know you're not going to have a problem wow there's some audio  of uh the police officer oh uh last night what we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect  for the law well i have to agree with that officer then no that officer is wrong speaking of the new  class kenny with his name yes and anthony forgot to say how professional the nypd is of course yeah 
[00:55:30]  professional courteous while we're on the subject we all love the nypd we want to give a big shout  out to the academy class that's graduating this morning 10 a.m at madison square garden especially  company 06-05 congratulations to everybody best of luck and godspeed salute and remember and remember  there's cameras everywhere yeah guys please keep that in mind everyone every troublemaker has a video 
[00:56:00]  camera and remember you you young cops out there there's cameras everywhere don't think grandpa's  old cute stories can hold up these days right about tuning some guy up in the back of the car  and dropping him off in a bad neighborhood take him behind a building will you this guy he was a tool  and i knew from the moment he walked up he was a tool yeah he was a tool yes don't let one bad apple  spoil the whole bunch i'm not calling for anarchy i'm just calling out this one tool  it's officer not buddy is it stupid look now we got cops calling like crazy we got cops calling like 
[00:56:30]  crazy buddy is hold on buddy is disrespectful and then others saying it's fine so let's just let's  just leave it alone at that okay lighten up that's right one of our cop friends yelling from anyone that  says it's disrespectful in the tone that i said it in and in the moment that he came up  it was such a harmless thing it's not disrespectful uh a little more audio from uh the officer  son all i've ever asked of my marines is for them to obey my orders as they would the word of god 
[00:57:00]  and then when he called him buddy what's that supposed to be some kind of sick joke  the word of god it's uh it's officer not buddy oh sorry all right let's uh can i can i offer you  that sir let me let me beg forgiveness did he ask you if you're going to the kitkat club  yeah kitkat club couple of beautiful girls come out can we uh can we all uh agree that man town is  for faggots certainly can man town oh we got the latest batch of promos from wbcn up there in boston

[01:11:00]  oh  is it going to land  oh hey steve hi that thing folds right up into a briefcase it's amazing piece of technology wow and  katie says that uh your hybrid's doing nothing doing nothing stinks no no i know i think  your hybrid stinks certainly doesn't i don't like it the official man town vehicle really it is not  it uh it a lot a lot of people yapping about uh global warming now uh it was a big thing of course 
[01:11:30]  a lot of people were talking about it and then you got uh uh former vice president uh gore yapping  about it but then when stephen hawking came out and uh why didn't we get that audio by the way  this is imminent the earth is in trouble we need to do something immediately  do we and he's talking about leaving uh earth and we have to build moon bases 
[01:12:00]  and maybe mars you know he's like we got to flee the planet it's that urgent and it took him uh only  three months to say thanks most of the people had to go home yeah it was a conference what in uh  beijing or something yeah and they pretty much couldn't wait it out yeah please they had a movie  to go see if if you were if you were like him a a brilliant mind in just this shell that that is just 
[01:12:30]  an awful way to have to live a life wouldn't you kind of be a little bias and hope that the world  is going to end tomorrow like i think there's some hope in him that goes yeah you bastards i hope an  asteroid hits or i hope there's another uh immediate ice age or this global warming thing ends the earth  within you know our lifetimes because then i get to see everybody you know suffer and and drop dead  and i don't have to be in this stupid body anymore uh his life sucks so he wants everyone else's lives 
[01:13:00]  to suck it's basic human nature maybe he's not that smart after all it's basic human nature maybe  he's just a party pooper that's it because nothing works on you uh you certainly would like to think  everything just ends when you do and i gotta say it again you know he's basically he's the smartest  man in the universe yeah and he's basically saying earth is doomed and it was on page what 37  of the new york papers because the front page had to have something important something about 
[01:13:30]  britney spears dying right and there hasn't been any follow-up since no it's just like i was just  a story for that day who cares let's move on to other news the guy who i think he's the one who  theorized black holes he's like a theoretical physicist he takes what regular physicists do and  he theorizes further i could be a lot of string theory yes in his repertoire yeah he's a bright  cookie he sure is a smarty pants just but he can't even do math like with his hands he's just 
[01:14:00]  got to sit there with that head and think you know smarty pants and pencil legs jesus poor guy hey turn  of toes come here and ask me something you're real smart here's the latest on global warming today as  we told you earlier the northeast is bracing for possible record rainfall this after severe flooding in  houston last week and on the opposite end of the spectrum ongoing wildfires in the southwest  scientists say they know what's causing all of this extreme weather but warn that it is here to stay 
[01:14:30]  it seems to make no sense record drought right next to downpours just this week arizona on fire flash  floods in texas but to scientists it does make sense the simple reason the air is getting warmer and warmer  air holds more moisture so when the warmer winds sweep across wet farmlands they suck up more moisture  drying the farms out when the winds finally dump that moisture out as rain the downpours are much 
[01:15:00]  heavier suddenly you've got a gully wash you've got too much water and then at other times you've got  drier conditions potential for drought this is associated with global warming because of this  increase in water vapor in the atmosphere what about that anthony what about that oh and that  happened uh when a gully wash when did it happen this year we finally hit the mark because as far as  i'm concerned this uh rainy summer that we've been having is this year last year if you remember let's 
[01:15:30]  remember last year summer started in like april last year it was wonderful we had a long it's not  hot warm summer it's saying one extreme or the other in new york summer is not supposed to start  in april but it's supposed to get showers in april but what does this global warming bring mayflowers  what does it give us does it give us early long summers of of dry nice sunny weather or does it give  us this uh uh bleary dreary rainy summers that we we've been getting steve comment i think it gives you 
[01:16:00]  unpredictable weather unpredictable weather as opposed to the predictable weather that the world  has given us over the years like the ice age right every so often the earth's weather goes into a  pattern regardless of what we decide to spew out of factories or car exhaust pipes i'm sure now i'm  sure i'm not gonna be a complete idiot thank you i am certain that what we have done to this planet 
[01:16:30]  has somehow affected the weather on some level but this cataclysmic event we are all so stupidly  self-important as human beings that we think we are powerful enough to screw this planet up this  planet will swallow us all spit us out and start anew you're exactly planet of the eights you're exactly  right but you're i i think your desire to expedite that whole process is is desire no it's your guys 
[01:17:00]  desire you guys are have this calendar like hey it's at the end of this calendar year you have  december 31st penciled in as doomsday it's gonna take thousands upon thousands of years no who said  that plenty of people i read websites my friend a lot of people saying oil is going to run out in 20  years uh people are saying that the global warming thing is going to make cataclysmic events within the  next decade they're talking the truth of the matter truth of the matter if we keep going at this rate  and keep increasing and china keeps industrializing then perhaps in 10 000 years we might have a little 
[01:17:30]  bit of a mess on our hands then again who the hell knows what 10 000 years is going to look like  in the year come on everybody 25 25 if man is still alive who cares you'll be long dead and they'll come  up with something that they needed to fix it you know why we always have we just always have people  are pretty clever and the time the second we can't and we can't adapt and we can't fix it we then become 
[01:18:00]  extinct that's how this planet works it's it's just the way it is we figure it out we'll colonize the moons  that's the next step if in a few thousand years we're able to do that comfortably which i think  we will sooner than that but but you got to figure in in five ten thousand years which people don't  want to think about because it's so far away from their own stupid insignificant piece of crap little 
[01:18:30]  life that they want to think it's gonna oh it's all ending tomorrow no it's not you'll be gone you'll be  dust the people that mourned you will be gone and there'll be this uh uh uh technology will keep  growing we might go to mars or some other place and colonize the earth might uh become this uh burnt  out dead hulk like mars is now make it stop but but that's the way it is i feel like i'm eight years  old again i just found out i'm gonna die the way the planet has worked for centuries millennia 
[01:19:00]  it's what the i said who caused the goddamn i say the jews the jews exactly  what's wrong with you i'm sure  god damn jimmy hey we have another expert on uh global warming it's good old tippy tom from our  homeless radio show fantastic i love this clip it's really quick we asked tippy tom uh what he thinks  of global warming dan from rhode island you got a question for tippy tom and blue it's growling 
[01:19:30]  yeah i got a a question for old golden buns um hey tom what do you think about global  golden buns  what do you think about the global warming issue and uh how should we solve it  well i i believe in heat i like warm so global warming is good good yeah if you sleep outside  blue your thoughts global warming 
[01:20:00]  on global warming yeah i want more heat i get cold  there's the homeless take on global warming by the way back it up too uh you know how we're talking  about steven hawkins basically saying that uh the earth is doomed yeah earth earth uh earth days are  a number that yeah that was the quote from steven hawkins uh and it was on page 37 39 around there  you are buried in the paper pat munaki pat from munaki's checking in he said his hot dog eating 
[01:20:30]  contest that he won on the jersey turnpike somewhere in a rest area was on page two  page two pat from munaki eating hot dogs page two yeah just to let steven hawking world's days are  numbered it was buried friggin 30 there you go here's another clip on bad weather caused by global  warming from abc news certainly it is here in new york abc news more rain or more snow like this  winter in the western mountains 71 normally more snow is good news for farms and towns below 
[01:21:00]  three quarters of the west's water comes from snowpack but a warming trend over the past 30 years  means snows are often melting weeks too soon leaving drier summers like this year hot day like  this in the mountains the snow melting fast you might be tempted to think this is a sign of global  warming and climate change but of course it's not all by itself there are natural cycles some years it  melts earlier than others yeah extremes in the past like the dust bowl in the 1930s happened in only one 
[01:21:30]  region at a time what worries scientists now these climate extremes are global look at wildfires over the  the last five decades soaring in the u.s and the other continents floods the same precipitation for  the planet as a whole is up twenty percent so say sinus for the coming decades we must get ready for more  frequent extremes of too dry and too wet that's like filmstrip voice guy i know 
[01:22:00]  that's the filmstrip all right i told you a theoretical physicist who lives in my building  who i love you call him buddy no i call him doctor doctor and i creep him out completely he almost went  onto another elevator one time when i saw him like he was walking towards his elevator and i'm like hi  dr kaku i can say his name because he says he's an nyu professor and um he's like hi and he turned 
[01:22:30]  around and he almost walked towards the other bank of elevators because he thought i was just a weirdo he's a  genius and he's probably trying to figure out what type of organism you are right i really  i just want him to like me and talk to me and he won't let's go oh you just want him to be your  friend i just want to be friends with him just trade a little info but have him like you say something  that he goes it's interesting how's your sex like he'll ask you my set and i'll go that's cool what do  you think of uh you know what do you think of the uh string theory you just you just want to explore 
[01:23:00]  black holes with the guy yeah you and him and black holes right i told about the gravity thing  and he gave me a brief explanation on the way up i told you you were right i want to spit on  jeremy in jersey what's up hey listen i just tuned in so if i'm getting it wrong i apologize but it  sounded like you know some of the things anthony was saying he was sort of acting like you know  global warming either you know it's something that's not happening right now or it's far away  we don't have to worry about it's not a big problem so all i'm saying is like there's there  are no respected scientists out there that don't that don't believe that global warming is real and 
[01:23:30]  is happening and is caused by you know man-made greenhouse gases it's no big deal it's no big  deal look this is what i'm saying it is a big deal and like people either want they either want to say  it's not a problem can i ask you why it's a big deal what what in the long run is global warming why  is it such a big deal to uh uh to human beings on this planet well if you look at at the way that  the the polar ice caps are melting glaciers over time the levels the sea levels are going to rise 
[01:24:00]  hasn't right right right but it doesn't that take so long sir and hasn't and wait i'm not done i'll  let you finish i will let you finish doesn't that take so long and hasn't over the course of the earth's  whole entire history or at least until humans were here where when it got important hasn't the the world's  geography changed naturally where things that were land are now water and things that were 
[01:24:30]  water were now land and did we perish or did we just adapt well you said when we weren't here so  i mean obviously it wouldn't affect someone right here no it's changed since we've been here too  what is the big problem if some of the polar ice caps melt and some of the things that are land now  become water what's the big problem over the course of a very long time not  one cataclysmic event what's the problem one cataclysmic event i'm saying it's like within  the next 50 years stop it it is not here's where you idiots with your global one no you're you're 
[01:25:00]  idiots here's your panicky pete 50 years it's not going to be 50 years the office you're in right now  yeah in manhattan yeah yeah right now water in the street stop it you're silly you're silly  you're being silly have you looked into this at all have you looked of course i'm a genius you  idiot let me talk or not yeah i say let him talk yeah i want to go ahead i say sooner than 50 years  i'm on your side sir i say let jeremy speak we'll just build bigger walls to keep the water out 
[01:25:30]  i know that you're putting on these sensational things to radio because it's funny and i agree  with that but no but i'm saying is you need to look at something besides the crazy media sensationalism  look at the real facts that are out there how are you get where is your timeline coming from  you've got to be kidding me you haven't looked into any of this yes i have where is your timeline  coming from have you i i went to see al gore speak all right al gore your 50 year timeline's  coming from al friggin gore that guy has got a lot of scientists on his side enough he has a lot 
[01:26:00]  of scientists on his side 50 years and manhattan will be 50 years all the reputable scientists on  his you're saying 50 years there's no scientist who's not a quack jeremy not real jeremy i'm gonna  leave something in my will okay okay and i want you to also please if in 50 years there is not water  right down on the street of here my kid i won't have one but i'll i'll designate somebody of the same 
[01:26:30]  age gets to gets to murder your child uh with impunity gets to choke your kid because you're  being an idiot 50 years and manhattan's gonna be covered in water what is your reason for thinking  it can't happen you talk because you talk about humans think that we're so important we call this  change why do you think humans think like we're so invulnerable because you think we're so important  that we have the power to change something in such a short amount of time get out of here this earth  is going to do what it wants to do it's going to go through cycle weather cycles and there's no way 
[01:27:00]  we are going to cause the ice caps to melt so quickly that manhattan is going to be covered in  water in 50 years that whole panicky pete thing's been going on for years probably 50 years dancing  feedback is going crazy here chris and philly and some of us don't want to be extinct and what and what  are you uh basing your position on guesses some gut instinct path performance wishful thinking but  jeremy jeremy jeremy oh he's gone uh chris from cue guards he hung up no we're just trying to move 
[01:27:30]  on he didn't hang up he was hanging in there and uh every scientist in the world disagrees with you  there's not one peer-reviewed article in a scientific publication that disagrees that global warming is  real and a real problem sure there isn't just not ones you've read popular press not one that you've read  it's another agenda driven thing also i'll tell you that a lot of people that um uh have a certain  agenda will only listen to certain scientists and a lot of people that have uh the other agenda will  only listen to other scientists that that do uh dispute this uh it believe me it's not going to 
[01:28:00]  be some quick everyone loves hollywood movie type friggin endings their argument may be that it's not  quick it's been happening for a while and hold on it's right am i right no it's been happening for  like the last 30 years and now the problem is coming exasperated and if it opens a little hole  the heat that can come into that hole could probably melt things i that's probably the  argument they're making is it's not just starting not like going from today right no it's not it's 
[01:28:30]  it that that's exactly the point that these global warming uh scientists uh bring to light it's not  this didn't just show up the i think people are just starting to pay attention now there's not  they've been paying attention for a while these these are also weather cycles does everybody agree  that the earth itself independent of anything that's happened is its own little entity it works  it has its own cycles that go through changes right course yes of course and do you also agree  that uh a lot of uh uh stuff uh uh the earth does to itself sure volcanoes are a huge uh source of 
[01:29:00]  pollution could those changes be expedited by some kind of intervention whether it be us probably not  not well probably not there is nothing we can do so severe that is either going to push it one way  or the other so far that we're going to cancel out the earth's natural cycles which we're probably  going through now it's probably a cycle that uh in a few years will be something else well not not to 
[01:29:30]  just not to disagree with you you know and take stephen hawking side uh but i i i think that um  i i think where does he go a little hole in the atmosphere becomes a bigger hole i do think that  can cause a lot of a certain amount of melting which then no one is saying that the planets can  become a mess it's just oh no we'll adapt we'll adapt for a while a problem they certainly are saying  that chris and philly i gotta read this it's gonna piss off anthony but uh anthony yes uh updated 
[01:30:00]  i hate that it updates and and your big quote goes away anthony you you usually sound like you know what you're  talking about right now you sound like some talk show hack read some scientific journals i do to  politicians i do realize you are wrong you know you people are panicky petes they're all on this  bandwagon you're the bandwagon jumpers i know what i'm talking about i do read why i read both sides i don't 
[01:30:30]  go see al gore's effing movie and then decide that that's law that that's what's going down that  that's the ultimate in what's happening on this planet al gore's movie did you see al gore's movie  i think we need no  stephen hawking said it he like another panicky peter no i i understand but but stephen hawking is also not  not putting a 50 year time frame on this i'm so bummed because last night i could have seen al gore's 
[01:31:00]  movie or click you saw click that's more entertaining right in this conversation today instead of seeing  that adam stephen hawking is not saying 10 years 50 years 100 years he's talking uh all right a long  time all right well like i said we're very adaptable and the second we're not dinosaur city boom out off  we got a lot of people that want in uh we'll go to the phones after the break also as we go to  break speaking of global warming and the craziness that is happening including hurricanes yes the 
[01:31:30]  hurricanes are on their way yeah of course the chinese are coming and the hurricanes are on their  way blame the chinese in china for their uh burning coal more homeless radio with tippy tom he discusses  hurricanes all right tom let's uh that's a good point let's go to the phones peter from massachusetts  you got a question for blue and tom on homeless radio hey guys uh i have a question it's actually  two parts number one do you think we're going to have a bad hurricane season and do you think a 
[01:32:00]  hurricane will hit new york city well i really feel sorry about that i have no control over the weather  and the thing is if you had a hurricane that's nature and so you pray to god to please  pray to god all right believe in god that's what i do uh the thing is that that hurricane come over  and blew your house over i i had no control over that i'm not all that powerful i wish i could i would 
[01:32:30]  stop it but a hurricane is a hurricane and you gotta deal with it ob the bone crusher hughes plus  anthony the hitman kumia equals party city the opian anthony show yeah right sounds good here what  everybody else is talking about oh and a uncut and live continuing the show on xm satellite radio 
[01:33:00]  starting at 9 a.m eastern visit xmradio.com to subscribe the opian anthony show  this is the opian anthony shoot hi once again i want to say hi to washington dc  being heard on wjfk for the first time in about four years today right what's up 
[01:33:30]  up want to continue with global warming jimmy's a little bit why  maybe one one that uh agrees and one that doesn't oh and then we're done with that subject  let's say hi to dana dana dana dana what's up dana new york welcome back to new york we're very  excited you're here uh we're excited to be back thanks for buying the xm we greatly appreciate it 
[01:34:00]  where were you you've been around for two years that's being kicked off the radio but  all right we're back they don't want to flip the bill right what's going on dana um you know i have  to agree all these people it's all just you know an agenda it's just something that you know for the  oil companies they have to try to feed them in congress and the only way to really do that and get  their word out to say that they're bad and they're causing global warming and everything we do with 
[01:34:30]  the cars and all this nonsense the bottom line is there are a lot of scientists out there in the  community that aren't being heard as much that are saying that we are still slowly coming out of the  ice age and that is why there is a warming pattern and it's going to continue how about that  uh exactly and i dana i know you're making a very very important intellectual uh point but uh jimmy has  found something funny in the paper and uh sorry i didn't mean we have to go to jimmy i can't believe 
[01:35:00]  something so important as global warming and jim laughing as it must be something that just the  the uncontrollable uh laughter that set them off uh very important indeed i can't help it  i was looking at the funny paper oh no not the funny paper  well we all know how funny newspaper comics are that's right just a laugh riot jimmy's a huge fan 
[01:35:30]  the first one starts with the uh the sarge and a black uh gentleman soldier they're looking at  look he can't even get it out you know nothing funnier than newspaper comic strips entertainment  from the 1800s has always been hysterically funny the sarge is looking at the garbage can right and he  goes uh come out of that can beetle i know you're hiding in there and the uh the black guy is looking 
[01:36:00]  and he yells uh here comes the general and in his second um uh a panel the uh the sarge and the black  guy are saluting and beetle here it comes he stood up in the garbage can with the lid on his head  he's he's saluting and the caption is the general saying the man on the left is out of uniform 
[01:36:30]  that's a good new one we need we need to update the uh the near miss 
[01:37:00]  very good wait so who's out of uniform well because now he needs to know i lost something  what happened was beetle beetle was um he was hiding in the garbage can and more ridiculous than  him going hey why are you in the garbage can he's saying hey you're out of uniform because he's like  in a garbage can he's in the garbage standing up and he's got the lid on his head because i guess he  heard that the general was coming so he stood up yeah oh oh so he's wearing a garbage can yeah 
[01:37:30]  technically from by the way we're actually the government is starting to do this thing  uh where they go house to house and if you're actually caught enjoying dunesbury they smash  your face with a rock rightly so which one did you like eric oh calvin and hobbes oh you really like  calvin and hobbes where are they did you used to buy the little day calendars you don't tear it off  and get a brand new calvin and hobbes every day a little known fact my brother is a cartoonist and 
[01:38:00]  he was this this close to being syndicated across let me uh tell the listeners opie was just holding  his thumb and forefinger very very close together this close and and he's gonna visualize it and  he's beyond frustrated because you know he pretty much has to wait for some of these dumb strips to  finally die but even when they're dead the lockhorns guy died years ago and his son uh excuse me the  lockhorns guy yeah befriending my brother did he big time and then died showing him the biz and 
[01:38:30]  things were going well and then he uh dies on him it's like this is great all you got to do is goof  about her cooking who in where by the way why are calvin and hobbes on the paper oh my god that hasn't  been in the paper in years jimmy oh did global warming killed them off it was an awful thing what happened  the guy retired years ago well but like anthony said that that doesn't matter they the the strips go on  the strips go on and on and on peanuts charles schultz dead dead no he's dead he was very badly 
[01:39:00]  raped you see brett from instant feedback funny papers bit greatest bit ever by the way there's  actually a funny paper jimmy reads the funny papers uh senator norton the person of auntie stop you're  spilling it hagar the heart like there's actually somebody that draws a cartoon named agnes  agnes agnes not one of your more well-known comic strips here's what this is two lesbians are  walking they appear to be lesbians i can't thank you fiorella laguardia reading us the paper during 
[01:39:30]  the strike what an ass my one goes they're both just walking sidewalk one goes my imaginary friend  started following me around again and the other one goes oh and then the other one goes the odd thing  is she usually shows up during one of my bouts with emotional stability and then she goes it's not  like her to show up during a period of normalcy like i'm having now and then the other one goes  maybe she likes you better when you're normal  like how do you know when that one's over like when you don't because i didn't when you're writing 
[01:40:00]  that i bet you that's a continuous story for about 15 panels and i bet you they just cut it in threes and  mail out whatever it is what crap no why because no one's looking so they're getting away with murder  yeah they just draw a paycheck there are some that are like they've been in the paper for a  century uh for years and it's an ongoing like soap opera in the comics who who is so starved for  entertainment that they need to read like brenda star you know what though uh sudoku is taking over 
[01:40:30]  the world because the chinese are coming and uh they're taking up more and more space and eventually  it's going to be all sudoku is there still brenda star i think so because you ever read some of  those like like you just out of nowhere open it up and and it'll be dandy is there still dandy in the  favor that's from like 1850 that you'll read brenda star and it'll be something like brenda get in the  car okay she gets in where to take me to work the end and like you're like what the what what what 
[01:41:00]  just because it's a soap bar but uh so uh daryl pennsylvania what's up yeah that was kind of weak  man what's that buddy don't try don't try to cover it up now with something funny man you guys rock  still love you but what do you mean oh you didn't like what do you mean you didn't like oh my god  okay doesn't get the bit guy strap in strap in for trying to get the bit guy daryl your doesn't get  the bit guy how cool is that for you today i guess you talked me into it wait daryl he's doesn't 
[01:41:30]  that guy it was never supposed to be funny see i can't believe i got to tear down the fifth wall  today fine yeah well the bit is that the deal is man and i don't want to explain the bit because  then it's going to ruin the bit for others but the bit was there it's not funny oh my god give me  finger blame it's funny but we all know the the cartoons stink oh boy it's a tumor when you have to  spend more than 30 seconds explaining it daryl oh poor daryl you're a dummy you're

[01:42:30]  hysterically then he goes then he goes and and then you cover it up nice covering it up it wasn't  funny for everybody else like we've ever covered up when something's bombed on this show by trying  to make it as long as the voices in your head think it's funny that's what counts wow daryl  you're don't get the big guy today thank you he's the guy that wanders around the party trying to  fit in but doesn't get anything and they just all that poor mike poor bastard mike from pennsylvania

[01:43:30]  looking at each other like uh you know one said something the other's looking at it inquisitively  and it's it's lovely it would have been funny if there was one on each leg and they were just  pointing up the thigh going what the hell is that falling let's go to kevin in edmonton by the way  before kevin before you talk you want to hear funny cartoons hustler hustler magazine has the  only playboys cartoons suck they try to be political because they're dopes yeah hustler cartoons yeah  are laugh out loud funny very funny uh let's say hi to uh actually it's keith and edmonton

[01:45:30]  and i do have you guys an excellent but my job is a limo driver unfortunately these cars don't have it  in the morning so now i have some fun radio in the morning that's it all right doll i want to say  what's up to jimmy i saw your show oh thank you and um do you guys hear about the guy in providence who  won a lawsuit from some implant company yeah it's like a my 10-year erection wait ah yes we did hear about  the uh implant story yes sir hold on hold on hold on mark hold yeah hold on yeah hold on here here's  the uh see we the quandary we're in yeah this is the quandary we're in one of the greatest stories 
[01:46:00]  ever was printed over the weekend i got in front of me and we don't even know how to handle it on  this side of the opian anthony show yeah we'll get to it hold on mark because i i think you're going  to blow up our spot but we did see the story we'll talk to you soon all right all right how about we get  to it at nine o'clock that's what i'm thinking this might be an xm story today absolutely we can't  cover it properly here because uh well you want to try uh i'll just give the basic story and then  we'll have to give the details you know let me read details let me read all right i'm a good reader 
[01:46:30]  at times good luck four hundred thousand dollars for ten years of painfully hard time we're allowed  to say that that's the title so far so good all right providence rhode island a former handyman has  won more than four hundred thousand dollars in a lawsuit over a am i allowed to say this let's say  over a penal implant that gave him a 10-year you know what how's that anthony how is that hot yeah  you got to think a little bit on this show yeah okay so for 10 years he had a you know what 
[01:47:00]  yeah uh charles uh chick is his middle name or his nickname what's wrong  we're gonna be able to get through this uh this is gonna be a rough one yeah i'm just thinking  because it was prefaced by what the guy said on the phone that there might be an issue now  really yeah are they dumping out see if he rocked if he working today if we hadn't taken that call  see we can never depend on the listeners well that's why i stopped them  huh nothing dumped so far all right charles chick is his nickname or middle name lennon 68 received the 
[01:47:30]  steel and plastic implant in 96 of course that was before all the lovely pills were invented yeah  so you had to go uh down this road oh yeah all right i i'm thinking this thing kind of works like uh  you know those uh cop steel batons yeah you ever see they pull it out and go like yeah and uh it gets  longer and kind of locks in position yeah these these rings are separated by springs and and i think what 
[01:48:00]  what you do is you're able to pull the implant and it kind of like clicks into position where it  it's uh fully opened no this works like a cop a time but the problem is the guy will go it's officer  not buddy and it just springs to life itself you could jimmy a door with it but but his problem was  it could uh open up but then it locked in that position for 10 years so he couldn't then uh get what 
[01:48:30]  would amount to a cop steel baton back into the uh on uh extended position where you could then put  it in you know that's right it's holster or whatever they they uh hold it in so now you're stuck with  this what is amounts to an extended baton that you now have to walk around with right and it's very  obvious that the baton has been extended it must walk around with an extended we got baton in your 
[01:49:00]  pocket we got it it malfunctioned yeah all right uh the greatest paragraph ever in a newspaper is  about to be right here he said he couldn't this is why he got four thousand dollars he said he could  no longer hug people and no one wanted to hug him geez he can no longer ride a bike swim or wear  bathing trunks because of the pain and embarrassment why couldn't you ride a bike wait what's the what's  the what is what is the next line there's another line in there which really makes me laugh he has 
[01:49:30]  become a recluse yeah and is uncomfortable being around his grandchildren uncomfortable his lawyers  because you know they always ask the question they gotta explain it kids  kids are always asking questions he's grandpa creepy look grandpa creepy we're just uh touching  the surface with this no we're not when we can when we continue on xm we'll really really get into this 
[01:50:00]  story but uh did we get through this sort of i think that's good all right uh you know what notice  the genius of the cop baton analogy yeah see that saved us yeah my friend why don't we just keep it at  that yeah and we'll do a little more on this when we go over to xm in about a half hour okay cute  it's the greatest story ever though oh thank you for the family circus oh i got one of them nice  there's two family circuses and bill keen writes them and this bill keen sure knows how to touch that 
[01:50:30]  nerve in all of us it's a circle and it's got the father and the little girl driving and there's a bit  of shade in the top of the car he's shading the father's face but the little girl is getting the  light showing right in her face and and and this is as cute as it gets she says daddy will you will  you move the son please oh yeah this this says a lot of things uh naivete naivete of a child the uh 
[01:51:00]  looking up to the father as if he could do everything you know they're driving in the car  that's sweet sure daddy will you move the son please who hasn't had a moment like that um god  we should try to get my brother's uh cartoon published in one of these papers wish they'd  show two seconds later when they hit the abutment or yes or uh daddy could you move the dock please  as he's getting out of the minivan waving buh-bye to all his problems and there's the other one it's the 
[01:51:30]  mother pouring cereal for all the kids and the little boy breakfast table scene all the kids  sitting around waiting eagerly for their breakfast he says i wish we could have gruel  g-r-u-e-l is how it's spelled and it's called capitalized i wish we could have gruel for breakfast  oliver twist even wanted seconds oh see the kid didn't know gruel is an awful thing but because  oliver was so poor and was so hungry even he wanted two helpings of that it just goes to show 
[01:52:00]  you how pathetic and sad oliver was but he sees it as it must be good because he wanted to  kill yourself and you know who should be pouring him breakfast is the is the mother from sixth sense  who was pouring soup with a sick kid  all right nice uh topical reference to bill keen like any kid would know who oliver twist is  in uh this day and age i'd like to smack bill keen right in the mouth with a police baton that won't 
[01:52:30]  go down repeatedly from grandpa creepy yeah why did it take him 10 years to file a lawsuit man  mm-hmm when you file that immediately can't hug his grandkids can't ride a bike or hug people how many  times he's heard ew ew grandpa what's that uh could you take him out of here take him out of the room  all right we gotta take a break by the way if you want to look look i'm grandpa look and you know they

[01:59:00]  defamation so it's really glad glad we're glad we're so glad and they were doing the media awards  last night so um i stopped there and could not change the channel it's actually a great channel  it was oh my god did you see that show uh don't like that it's not a cigar  i gotta tell you i was just fixated with it uh it was a whole thing of you know empowerment and and 
[01:59:30]  gay pride and everything and that's fine and dandy i got i really have no problem with that they brought  up a bunch of uh uh gay people presenting to straight people who have uh uh during the course of their  career um kind of uh shown gay people as equals which is great they brought charlize theron onto the  stage and you couldn't have seen a more bored crowd of men really oh i was that's like that 
[02:00:00]  that was the fun of watching this whole thing it was an audience full of like the best dressed  best hair uh guys all sitting there some of them holding each other's hands and then you'd have like  charlize theron walks up in this little gown and just looking hot hot and uh stands by the mic and these  guys are like oh boring they're just snap it up bitch boring come on bitch get the speech over 
[02:00:30]  with care terrific care exactly  and one of the straight guys in the audience people keep your hands off of my meal yeah he was just a  seat warmer that's who they should have sent out to do comedy it should have been bob kelly and a  pair of assless chaps with an open leather vest if it was assless chaps he'd be invisible 
[02:01:00]  that's right stupid we're calling you an ass total ass  so i i was watching that and uh wow there are some very very gay people  getting up accepting awards and everything and it's been i guess all gay weekend with gay pride uh  where the gay pride parade here down here the award kind of looks like a black power thing  because it's like it's like a nice award with a fist on it i was saying like empowering  you know you don't have to tie up your hands holding it when you carry it out 
[02:01:30]  of course you don't  hey how do i get this thing out of here oh i see  god that'll work so i i noticed um during the commercials on logo this was on logo which is on  cable vision uh i know cable vision carries it i don't know if time warner does but uh they carry  logo it's the gay channel it's the gay channel oh my god it's a yes homer it's an entire channel 
[02:02:00]  of nothing no nothing but gay programming  don't worry  it's okay  p.s i am gay three simple words i am gay i wish i knew how to quit you 
[02:02:30]  yeah really good shows man so i was yeah i i was seeing some of the advertisements uh the promos  for new programming yeah and then there's a a whole movie thing that they do uh uh quintessentially  queer it's called and i guess queer has become like i wish we could say it but the n word in the  gay community where it's okay for gay people to use the word queer um when describing themselves or  programming or something like that but straight people can't use it because it's very derogatory 
[02:03:00]  the stupidest thing i don't like that rule i don't like that rule that rule stinks with the black  word it stinks with the gay word i'm like okay from this day forward it is never called the n  word it's the black you just coined a perfect example because it seems more offensive it's  as the black black word jesus right but that argument is so stupid we're allowed to say it but  you're not yeah no it's the other way uh everyone should be allowed to say whatever 
[02:03:30]  the hell of course it's freedom of speech that's what it is yeah unfortunately for some people freedom  of speech includes the freedom to for other people to offend you with their words or ideology or  whatever and that's what it is there's this thing in this country where freedom of speech again if it's  not pleasant and uplifting it is not considered uh defensible but that isn't what freedom of speech has  ever been about of course it's it's always been about the reason you need it if everything was  pleasant and everyone agreed with it you wouldn't need to write it down and say hey people have the 
[02:04:00]  freedom to speak it's because everyone would go i don't mind what he's saying it's lovely it's the  freedom to say things that people don't want to hear it's to protect unpopular speech right and  again we all know tpm time place and manner you can't yell fire in a movie theater we're not  talking about that we know it can you yell the black word in a casino that's being shot up though i  i couldn't believe that they were that that happened in these golden nugget which is just  a fantastic casino wonderful two hundred dollars saved for the year  almighty you should be shot just for staying there 
[02:04:30]  yeah great well anyway so i'm watching the gay channel by the way the black word you mean lazy  and no i don't know mr torrance mr torrance of course all right let's go yeah the um the gay channel  so i was watching some of the uh the promos i said promos for for shows that are on one is uh  noah's ark all right what's wrong with noah's ark uh yeah noah's ark yes felt a-r-c uh logo 
[02:05:00]  explores the daily lives of noah alex ricky and chance four african-american gay men in los angeles  through their relationships with their friends and lovers noah believes he's finally found a love  in his new boyfriend wade wade my dear wade oh these are fantastic numbers there chance but uh  soon uh realizes that he along with his best friends must still endure the everyday drama that 
[02:05:30]  comes with living in la from new boyfriends to strained friendships to career changes these men  persevere and live their lives with grace and wit did you see the big episode where all wade uh  thought that noah was cheating and uh the big line was i'm not cheating that's tapioca on my face 
[02:06:00]  no i missed that one yes the pudding chronicles someone's got to get audio of these tv shows please  oh yeah absolutely then there's um one of my favorites here it's called the complete tale of  the city and uh here's here's a little uh uh synopsis of an episode tensions arise i guess it's this  multi-cast like an ensemble cast kind of soap opera i guess you can compare it to a dallas or a 
[02:06:30]  falcons crest kind of a show knows there's a tom sellick looking guy yeah tom sellick i would  have a 70s porno mustache but tensions rise at 28 barbary lane as norman investigates mrs madrigal's  past edgar is blackmailed by an anonymous man and learns of mrs madrigal's secret michael unexpectedly  finds a a friend uh is the straight as a straight womanizer brian as they go out uh together searching  for a good time and then of course john spends time in a bathhouse and encounters a familiar face 
[02:07:00]  like the whole thing was okay like you could kind of get like it's almost like a uh um what the  hell is that stupid show with the old broad solving crimes oh oh uh the murder she wrote yeah it was  almost like a murder she wrote episode until the bathhouse at the end wait i want to know what the  familiar face in the bathhouse he saw it was the grim reaper his physician 
[02:07:30]  oh jesus but every episode has to have some type of this uh real hardcore gay thing like and that's  all the shows it's not just about like god because i know gay guys and gay people in general want  acceptance in society as just let us be us but the shows aren't just like gay guys it's got to be some  over-the-top thing like why does it have to be in a bathhouse that is such a stereotypical place for 
[02:08:00]  gay people to be the bathhouse meet dirk he's a decorator of glory holes my day is he  of course he is of course i want him teaching my children of course i do and then they had um  oh this this one isn't what i thought from the title the title's called wisecrack must be about a smart  girl it's it's a stand-up comedy series oh i get it featuring uh the best of comics uh judy gold 
[02:08:30]  uh alec mappa mappa hawaii on his back no  well yeah and a bunch of i guess gay comics  open bar new series follows one man's personal decision to come out as uh gay to his family and  friends told against the backdrop of his work to open a new gay bar in west hollywood good luck  jesus from the groundbreaking uh to the grand opening to the opening of the bar 
[02:09:00]  open bar tracks the entrepreneurial owner as he balances his new profession uh uh personal  and professional endeavors it's like cheers for gay people right  of course i think we're gonna have to continue uh they they push in your stool as a courtesy yeah  you certainly do we're running out of time here unfortunately and the uh programming that i  noticed was all and this is real like xena warrior princess which is very um uh lesbian things a lot 
[02:09:30]  of uh gay uh themed shows that weren't supposed to be gay but just come off as gay and then movies  they have a whole series on movies gay that gay people enjoy not even gay movies like did you know  they like barbarella really yeah they liked uh they like anything with streisand in it and things like  that but not necessarily um game learned a lot about the gays uh through logo well over the weekend  we'll have more on uh the fine new uh gay and lesbian oh tv network yes certainly in the coming weeks we

[02:19:00]  arrests have been made police are still investigating  let's do it the blonde one uh radio shots our society needs borders these parameters you  dick they get their jollies by saying let's keep pushing the envelope they were doing what they  were paid to do even when there are bucks to be made there's a price to be paid in terms of the 
[02:19:30]  cultural degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore are you adequately prepared  to rock rock rock but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the road  let's get it  like 
[02:20:00]  and  get it  so  so  so  Ah, man. 
[02:20:30]  How long was that going?  Ah, a while today.  That's got to get annoying.  Well, the elevator took forever today.  Got the show already.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Next time, satellite radio.  Our second job.  Yeah, you know, Mike, we have like two jobs to make ends meet. 
[02:21:00]  We're trying to make ends meet.  We've got to make ends meet in these tough times, Opie.  That's right.  That's why we can hold down two jobs.  All right.  Back to the bit on cocksucker broadcasting.  By the way, how about that grandpa with the metal cock?  God, did I want to say that.  Old tin dick.  Come on, kid. 
[02:21:30]  Bounce on my lap and get an asshole full of memories.  I don't like sitting on grandpa's lap.  It makes my butt wet.  Does it?  Earn those toys.  Grandpa creepy.  This roll a quarter's cock.  I'm so ashamed.  I can't even bounce my grandson on my lap with my hands on his shoulders like I used to do.  By the way, this is what we weren't allowed to read in the article over there. 
[02:22:00]  The door or two is designed to allow impotent men to position the penis upward for sex and then lower it.  Yeah.  Like you're lowering a drawbridge, I guess.  That's funny.  I can't believe they wouldn't let you say that over there.  I know.  But whatever.  That's fine.  That's why we got here.  And the Washington Post, the headline today is Opie and Anthony get the last laugh.  What's that?  I'm just letting the folks know the headline in the Washington Post today.  Opie and Anthony get the last laugh.  That is very cool. 
[02:22:30]  We do.  Do we?  I want...  They were a little nervous that the Washington Post wasn't going to give us a good article.  They gave us a great article.  Well, we've had our run-ins with them before.  They didn't get everything quite right, but they never do.  They quote Anthony when I'm talking.  They quote...  Yep.  They got my quote wrong.  They added in, like, things to my quote.  It's weird what they...  I don't get that.  They will just add in.  And there's no accountability for that stuff.  No.  No recourse.  I forget what I had. 
[02:23:00]  I want bananas, strawberry, and what was it?  Pineapple?  Pineapple.  Pineapple.  Why do you want to tart it up like that?  I don't want mango.  Mango's good.  I hate mangoes.  Mango's good.  Have a mango.  That's what Chef threw at Lance when he was trying to get the puppy here.  Take a mango, too, when they shot the whole family in Apocalypse Now.  Right.  It was great.  Check behind that basket.  G.H., anything?  G.H.?  No, I don't like smoothies anymore.  I want a smoothie.  I want banana, pineapple, and strawberry. 
[02:23:30]  You want some blueberries?  I don't want blueberries.  I don't know how you eat those deli blueberries.  Kenny knows mine.  Those are healthy blueberries.  Some of them are, but sometimes you get the one at the bottom with the little white beard on it.  They're just the most...  They're too tart.  Not if you get them right.  They're out of season.  They're out of season.  They're out of taste.  They're out of season.  They're out of taste.  I get blueberries all year long.  They're tart, though.  You're right.  Even at the ponds, which was great.  They were a little tart, the blueberries.  I like sweet fruit. 
[02:24:00]  Your cantaloupe.  Your honeydew.  I'm sure you do.  Your strawberry.  I want a banana, too.  Your logo.  Sweet fruits.  No.  All right.  All right.  Let's see this.  Wow.  We're good.  Is that it?  That's it.  I don't want to be this good.  I'm going to be the one that speaks.  We're being too good over there.  No, we're not.  We need to blatantly curse.  No, we never do.  Why would we do that?  No, that doesn't make it through anyway.  Hey, no cursing.  I'm going to curse tomorrow. 
[02:24:30]  No.  No, we don't need it.  I'll dump.  No, you won't.  No cursing.  We don't need to curse.  I curse tomorrow.  We look silly.  I curse tomorrow.  But it won't make it through.  See, the reason that only one dump is good is that we are getting this stuff out in a form  that is perfectly fine for the FCC.  I'm cursing tomorrow.  This one wasn't even a bad word.  What?  This dump sheet thing.  Do we even need to do the dump sounder?  No.  I think we do.  No. 
[02:25:00]  No, there's only one.  7.26 a.m.  Phone number given out during fake listener produced Mantown promo.  A phone number was given out?  Yeah, he did like 1-800 or hot cock and then he gave the real number out.  So it was.  What an idiot.  Yeah.  Can we ever go with no dumps?  You know, just a little, you know.  Oh, it's got to be one.  Excuse me.  Joe in D.C. has something.  Hey, Joe.  Yeah, blueberries are in season, Jimmy.  I got them in my front yard.  I'm not a fruity, but I love them. 
[02:25:30]  Okay, why don't we do a whole segment today on what's your favorite fruit and why?  I love blueberries.  I thought the blueberries because I was eating blueberries and they were tart.  Like, I like a sweet blueberry and a tart blueberry is not quite as good.  That's why I'm getting pineapple, strawberry, and blueberries.  And they're too small.  Hey, Brian O'Dell.  Brian.  Brian.  Hey there, Brian.  I'm from Mobile, guys.  What do you got to say? 
[02:26:00]  I got a question for you.  Sure.  Um, how the fuck can you guys not read something in the paper over the fucking radio?  It's ridiculous, dude.  Believe me, it really is.  I really don't get that.  I don't think I'll ever get that.  It is all, it all has to do with context.  That's just bullshit.  Well, dude, it's in a paper that kids could read.  I'm going to step out of character.  Is that the excuse?  Oh.  This is the actor.  No, that's my bitch.  What? 
[02:26:30]  Don't start throwing booveries at you.  I'm just saying.  Don't steal another one of my bits.  I only have a couple.  I was saying this is the actor from Lucky Louie.  That's who I am.  Oh.  Why can't I do that?  Wow.  Because I thought he was going the other way.  What?  I thought he was trying to steal your bit.  What bit?  Don't take my bit, please.  That's all I got.  Dude, I'm the actor from Lucky Louie.  People know me as Jim Norton.  Greg Hughes, the actor that plays O.P.  No, it'll be on the ocean.  That's my bit.  Why would I do that?  That's my bit.  Don't take my only bit.  Oh, speaking of bits.  No, that was my brother's bit that I stole from him. 
[02:27:00]  You can't steal it from me.  Yeah.  Why would I steal it from you?  That's my bit, too!  What?  Always asking the question when things aren't done right.  Why would it be?  Why would I have water here?  That's my bit!  Why?  That you enjoy because you...  Bit court.  Bit court.  I only got a few.  And don't tear down a wall, I'll freaking throw...  No, I wasn't.  I was going to pop up the ceiling tile and peek over.  I noticed that.  All you guys are tearing down walls now. 
[02:27:30]  It's funny.  We used to have this thing the comedians would do to each other.  We would take each other to hack court.  And me and Patrice and Keith used to take each other to hack court on each other's bits.  I'm taking you to hack court on that.  And we would just smash each other's bits.  Fat Patrice would never admit that one of his bits was hack.  It was just really brutal and great.  Me and Adam Ferrara and Joe Curry used to have bit court, which kind of sounds similar.  I'm ripping...  You were ripping us off.  Hoo-hoo!  But it was bit court.  And if you came out with something that sounded a little too close to the other guy's bit, 
[02:28:00]  it would have to be settled in bit court.  And we'd have to get some kind of a third-party arbitrator to listen to our story about how  the bit came up, who did it first, when, where.  And they would then decide who gets to keep that bit.  And Joe Curry lost once and almost in tears went,  Well, but what will I do at Eastside?  Eastside Comedy Club on a long island.  He lost his big case in court. 
[02:28:30]  Now what am I going to do at Eastside?  Did you guys ever get laid in that house?  Nah, it was just a collection of guys fucking around.  It was like the Logo Channel.  It's just awful.  Will in Michigan.  Will?  Hello.  Hey, Will.  How are you?  Hey, Will.  Hello there, Will.  How's it going, boys?  Hello, Will.  Jimmy, are we allowed to talk about Lucky Louie?  Can we do it tomorrow?  Oh, yeah, maybe.  I want to watch it.  A lot of people might not have seen it.  Did you enjoy it?  We kind of agreed that Tuesday's Lucky Louie discussion day.  Okay, fair enough.  I hope you can't stay up that late. 
[02:29:00]  I got on DVR.  I'll be watching it today.  And actually, there's other people that are pissed off that we talk about on Monday.  No problem.  Talk to you tomorrow.  I hope you enjoyed it.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Bye.  I'm hearing good things.  I'll say that much.  I'm hearing it.  It was a very funny episode.  Hey, someone's saying, let's go to John Chicago.  John.  Hey, Opie.  How are you?  Hey, Jim and Anthony.  Hey, and you forgot Fan.  Hey, Fan.  And he's fantastic.  So, I think Jim and Anthony should stop stealing Opie's bits when Opie stops repeating all 
[02:29:30]  of Jim and Anthony's funny lines right after they say it.  Does Opie do that?  I never even noticed that.  I'm guilty of doing that all the time.  Really?  I, like, repeat.  I'll repeat a funny line all the time.  I didn't realize I did that.  And as I'm laughing, I'll go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, Grandpa Creeper.  Yeah, but I think that's true.  Like, I do that all the time.  I think that's just something friends, like, guys do, man.  We, like, you just, like, laugh at your friend's joke.  I think that's a pretty common thing that we all do.  Yeah, yeah, but people hate me, so they want to pick out this stuff. 
[02:30:00]  I don't think you, dude, are you shitting on Oprah now?  Bro, I didn't think he was shitting on you.  I think he's just, I don't.  He's still there, but, all right.  All right, I don't think he was trashed me.  Let's go to Bill at the Gay Pride Parade.  Bill at the Gay Pride Parade.  Bill.  I'll do it.  Hey.  What?  What, they catch Bill marching?  That fucking fantastic body of his, the little tube top.  Who went down the Gay Pride Parade?  Hair of spandex bike shorts.  Bill, look.  Who went down there that's willing to admit it?  Bill and a co-worker? 
[02:30:30]  Bill, right.  Yeah, who went just for the fun of it?  Here's Bill.  Who else went down there?  Looking fantastic.  How about you, Bill, or is your now known Mr. Popular?  Hey, everyone.  How's it going?  Did you get a haircut?  Uh, yeah.  Somebody ripped it out from the back.  Down at the Gay Pride Parade?  Uh, nah.  Not before that?  Nah.  Yeah.  Wait, who'd you go with?  It looks like you're freshly shampooed.  Yes.  Very, like, you have body to your hair today.  Yeah, it's a nice haircut.  It's got bounce.  You look like it's shiny a little, but not greasy. 
[02:31:00]  It looks like you should be on a Just For Men box.  Right.  Just for men.  That's what he looks like when he grows that friggin' Dan Haggerty beard in two days.  Just for men.  Did you do a lot of man-to-man kissing yesterday, did you?  Um, nah.  A little open mouth, a little butt-fuckin'.  Just because you're down there.  Hey, you know, you normally don't like, uh, what?  Like, uh, Spanish food, but you go to the, uh, Hispanic Day Parade, you might have some  Spanish food.  That's right.  You go to the gay parade, you don't normally like a cock in your ass, but, uh, you're there. 
[02:31:30]  Out of respect.  When in Rome.  Oh.  Hmm.  Take a big fistful of grease up the ass.  Hey, who'd you go with?  Child Star?  Nah, uh, actually, I just went with my friend.  I'm going to take Child Star down there.  Why do we only have one guy from the show going?  Take some, let's take some fresh steaks down to the lion's cage and throw it in and hope  they don't eat it.  Take Child Star down there.  Forget about it.  Why didn't he go?  I thought he was going.  Because he would be chum.  Basically, it was just myself and my friend Ed who volunteered to help when you found out 
[02:32:00]  who was helping.  Your close friend Ed.  He had no problem, uh, volunteering, right?  Yeah, I'll be there.  I was going anyway.  Just Bill and Ed, Ed and Bill.  Right.  Yeah, my bodyguard and me.  Hold, uh, any hand-holding?  As you're walking?  Nah, nah.  Get along to the crowd a little.  All right.  So what...  They'll hold on to each other.  So what'd you see down there?  Basically, we started, uh, at the top of the parade on 5th and we walked down it into  the, uh... 
[02:32:30]  Well, basically...  Started as a top.  It was like Conrad's Heart of Darkness.  As I walked closer to, uh, Christopher Street, Conrad...  It got a lot more weird and, uh...  Hold on, I gotta look.  That hedonistic society.  And it was...  I think he's accurate.  Yeah.  I think that was the original author, right?  Yeah.  The part...  Yeah.  But I'll bet you there wasn't a lot of violence.  Original author, right?  I never read.  Like there were more than one.  No violence, right?  On the ass.  And everyone knows it.  Uh, no violence.  There was definitely a lot of, um...  Love.  Homosexual people.  Well...  Oh, yeah.  The gay parade would draw homosexuals. 
[02:33:00]  If you're from out of town, you think it's just one big family?  Well, there's a lot of, a lot of ugly women in this family.  Uh, marching in very provocative attire.  Some of them, right?  Oh, yes.  A lot of trannies.  Um, yeah.  There were some.  Yeah.  It doesn't seem a little odd if you're trying to, um, assimilate to society and get the  respect that you are due as a human being.  Um, that you would choose to have a parade that is telecast, that shows the real fringe 
[02:33:30]  kind of stereotypes in that community.  Well, what's the point of acting like a human being, you know, to those people?  So, why would they want to assimilate?  They get, they, they love the fact that they're on the outside.  Yeah.  But the, the, the problem I have is not, I mean, they should be allowed to march, of course,  but it's that, like, the gay community complains, like, hey, you know, well, why can't we  be Boy Scout leaders?  And I agree in most cases, you should be able to, but when you as an organization showcase  the craziest side as well, they're part, look, black people, Irish, everyone has crazy 
[02:34:00]  or fringe members, and you don't have to shoot them, but you don't have to  stick them on a float and go, eh?  Eh?  Look at this guy, the way he sucks a cock, right in the middle of the street as he takes  one in the ass.  I mean, yeah, the Irish and the other ones don't showcase, or they shouldn't.  I mean, I guess, uh, you know, this Puerto Rican Day parade certainly did with some of the  questionable elements. 
[02:34:30]  Well, couple of years, sure.  So we got some audio, we should get right into it.  Yes, please.  Are you uncomfortable, Bill?  Let's dig deep into it.  Not really.  Let's thrust deep into it.  The first track is labeled, Two Gay Guys.  Ah.  Okay, that's simple.  This is Steve specific.  So let's listen to, uh, Two Gay Guys.  Two Gay Guys.  Jesus.  An elderly guy and his young friend.  Ew.  Yeah.  That's how I know, by the way, that I'm too comfortable around gay people in New York. 
[02:35:00]  Because I've actually seen people like that, and I've said, how did he hook up with him?  How did he get him?  Must be a sugar daddy.  There's nothing sadder than an old single gay guy.  There's one.  You know, he just ain't getting anything.  There's a sushi place I go to right around the corner from the cellar.  And there's a gay guy that goes in there, and he is, he looks like William Frawley, but  his head tapers.  He has a tiny tapered head.  He's a fat, older gentleman with a white must.  He is horrendous looking. 
[02:35:30]  And he hits on this very feminine looking Asian boy that works at this, uh, at this,  uh, uh, sushi place.  The guy is really a flaming homosexual.  And it's so funny to watch this older man try to seduce this young, svelte, uh, I'm guessing  pseudo masseuse.  All right, let's get into it.  Two gay guys.  All right, so I've noticed that you're gay.  On a scale of one to ten.  Oh my god, this is gonna be... 
[02:36:00]  Wow.  You are observant.  So what gave it away besides being at the gay pride parade?  Um, when the guy was pissing into a box on the sidewalk, the other guy was holding his  shoulders.  So...  All right.  I think it's gonna be the appropriate people to approach.  That would certainly give it away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got an answer for everything.  You should have been a detective, Bill.  Yeah, really.  All right.  So I've noticed that you're gay.  On a scale of one to ten, how gay are you?  Notice.  How gay am I?  I'd say about a six. 
[02:36:30]  Ten and a half.  Uh, was it easy to open up to your parents?  For me.  Not for them.  Fairly, yeah.  For you.  On a scale of one to ten, how disappointed were they?  Mother, not at all.  She knew before I did.  My father...  Half.  I'd say fifty.  All right.  Do you find the term faggot offensive?  No, I am one.  I am one.  You can't have people use it who don't mean it in a malicious way?  No, they're just ignorant.  When it's used maliciously, it's offensive, but... 
[02:37:00]  If I said, like, that tree's a faggot, would you be offended by that?  No.  It will be a bundle of sticks one day, by definition, when it's chopped down.  Actually, cool.  Um, who do you think of a better dresser, the gay community or the black community?  Or is that more influential?  Do you think Jesus was gay?  He had long hair.  Last question.  What do you think about f***ing as gay cologne?  Is that offensive to you?  No comment. 
[02:37:30]  Thank you very much, guys.  Thank you.  No problem.  When was that beeped?  Oh, boy.  Now we have a new problem.  Oh, well, this was bleep because we were thinking about playing it on the first half of the Opie and Anthony show.  But we're not over there anymore, are we?  Gee, I can't think of what that beep was covering.  Hmm.  Drakkar?  Yeah.  Which I'd rather wear a cum than Drakkar.  Cum?  Why would they bleep?  Oh, you think that was it?  Should I say?  Yeah.  It was, I think it was jism.  Fart.  Fart? 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, I guess.  I would have thought cum.  Is this whole thing bleep?  They're reburning the unbleeped audio as we speak.  They're reburning the unbleeped audio because the XMers are going to lose their mind.  We're playing shit that has curses in it on FM, and then we're coming here and playing bleep shit.  Why would we have it all figured out?  Why?  That would be crazy.  God damn.  How come no one helped Bill, though?  No one helped Bill this week.  Why didn't nobody help you? 
[02:38:30]  This is the greatest staff in radio history.  It really is.  You make a good point.  Shits and fucks get through over there on FM where the dump guy's got to hit the button.  Yeah, he's losing his mind.  But here, thank God we're bleeped because we'd hate to look like fucking assholes over here.  Hey, whoa, whoa, not that type of talk, Ant.  So now what?  Now what?  I got smoothie on my face.  Let's hope.  Mind you, yesterday, doesn't it, Bill? 
[02:39:00]  Bill, why don't you just sit there?  We're going to take a break, and we'll figure out this whole dump.  That sounds good.  A break.  Maybe we should play a Stephen Lynch song.  If I were gay, some kind of gay theme here.  Or a gay theme.  I like yogurt.  What about, we don't have that Norm Macdonald clip.  Oh, do we?  God, that's funny.  Have we played that over here?  Uncensored.  We have that?  It's one of our greatest clips ever. 
[02:39:30]  We have played it over here?  Yes.  Let's see.  See, now we've got to scrimm.  I want to hear it.  I want to hear it uncensored.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock comes running in.  Holy shit.  E-Rock.  He's just pointing at stuff.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Look at him go.  That mouse is just moving.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Loves cock.  E-Rock.  Loves cock.  E-Rock.  Likes cock.  Thanks.  I was just saying E-Rock. 
[02:40:00]  That's right.  That child's shirt.  Jesus.  What are you, a tall six-year-old?  What's the matter with you?  You can never win.  How can he?  With stripes on the sleeve and shoulder.  Vroom.  Vroom.  What's wrong with you, Eric?  Vroom.  Ah, shit.  Like you're racing into a cock backwards.  Vroom.  It's got racing stripes. 
[02:40:30]  Vroom.  What's that?  That's it.  All right, here's a thing in your club.  Here's our favorite club, Norm Macdonald.  Listen.  One time I was doing this thing in San Francisco and they were all gay people in the audience,  they told me.  So I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  No.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to it.  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about, because I went to this gay pride parade and I saw in it there  were these old men and old ladies with these signs that said, we are proud of our 
[02:41:00]  gay son.  And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, because it's not an achievement.  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I just wondered, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men are actually bragging.  I worked like, hey, Bill, my kid, oh my God, we're proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, first in his class, you know what I mean? 
[02:41:30]  And now he's articling over at a law firm and, oh yeah, he loves cock.  This kid.  He can't get enough cock in his mouth, his ass.  This kid's always cock.  I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's cock.  I want to talk to him.  To watch the maturation of you as an artist, to realize it took you nine and a half minutes 
[02:42:00]  to get around to the second cock stuff.  It's beautiful to see you comfortable in your own skin, Norman.  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton's thing.  Forget me not, you sightless thot, your dog just shit on my rug.  Thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony show.  You don't do sketches, stupid.  We have Jim Gaffigan in-house. 
[02:42:30]  We'll get him in in a few minutes here.  We're just trying to get through this gay pride parade.  We want uncensored audio for XM.  You got it?  Not yet.  We're waiting.  Should be done soon. 
[02:43:00]  I worry so much about that N-word.  I worry about shooting each other when one of you step on the other one's foot.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know what happened.  I'm just watching that video from the Golden Nugget, I guess.  That's the video of the day.  Yep.  Jesus Christ.  They have a better angle of it, too.  A cleaner angle.  The other way, you can really see the guy firing.  I don't know.  Apparently, a bunch of homeboys walking in.  They have a problem with each other.  One throws a beverage at one, which, you know, someone throws a drink at him. 
[02:43:30]  You got to pull out a gun and start shooting wildly into the crowd.  God.  They're not even good at it.  Jesus Christ.  How many innocent bystanders do you people shoot?  Can black people take shooting lessons?  Can we maybe give them amnesty for a day if they have illegal weapons that they could keep them if they at least take some fucking shooting lessons?  Hold the gun straight up.  Hold the gun straight up.  It looks cool sideways. 
[02:44:00]  We understand.  But you really got to hold it straight up so four-year-old kids don't get shot.  Okay?  That's a guy?  No.  I think it was the guy that he was shooting at.  I mean, I think.  Did he actually hit his target?  Wow.  The guy was two inches away from him.  Did the casino pay him for hitting his fucking target?  Because the odds are less of that happening than hitting the fucking jackpot slots.  The only violence I've ever seen in Vegas casinos on video is black guys freaking out.  Why is that?  If there's other footage, fine. 
[02:44:30]  Send me a link to it and I will absolutely correct myself tomorrow.  I've seen stealing any of the surveillance tapes, stealing white guy.  Everyone steals.  Always white guy that walks by and then they have a diversion so the old lady looks the other way and they steal her big bucket of coins.  Some of the funniest video ever.  I'm laughing at the old broad.  You dummy.  Like someone will drop something next to her.  Another one of the criminals will be in a team.  And one will drop something and go, oh, I'm sorry.  And the woman will bend over and go to get it. 
[02:45:00]  And as she bends over, someone just walks by, boom, takes a bucket of chips.  And they're out of there.  But then they show the door where they're trying to leave and then five security guys just jump on him, bring him to the back room, get the saw out.  Tune him up.  Tune him up a little bit.  The other thing in the news today, Warren Buffett is giving all his money to the second richest man in the world.  No, he is.  He's the second richest man in the world giving all his money to the richest guy in the world.  To the richest guy, okay.  Yeah, apparently, yeah.  Not to be confused.  How does that happen? 
[02:45:30]  Confused with Jimmy Buffett, who I don't think is giving his money to anybody.  Warren Buffett is giving his money to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  A billion dollars, right?  Something like that?  More than that.  More than a billion?  Could be a couple more than that.  Wow.  I like Bill Gates.  It's like what?  $37 billion.  $37 million.  Billion dollars.  Is it a billion?  Yeah.  Billion dollars.  He's just handing over $37 billion.  Yeah.  When?  When he dies or something?  No, he was going to do it when he dies, but now he's doing it as he lives. 
[02:46:00]  But he's doing it in, like, sections and segments so that his company can keep growing as he gives.  Does he have a family that's going, wait, wait, wait.  No kidding.  Pardon?  Excuse me?  Could I have something?  Does he do it depending on his checkup?  Maybe he found something, you know?  Plus, you're a little high this time around, Mr. Buffett.  Maybe he's got the big casino.  Right.  Or something.  But, yeah, man, that is a lot of money to hand over to a charity.  All right.  Maybe it's something that only rich people know about. 
[02:46:30]  Maybe it's a loophole to keep your money and not pay taxes on it anymore.  Maybe it's something Opie brought up in the office, a brilliant thing that people aren't thinking.  Maybe the rich have figured out immortality or space travel through black holes, and it costs this much to do it.  Right.  Microsoft has all that figured out.  And Microsoft's got it all because they got all the latest technology.  So Bill Gates has invented maybe a youth machine, and it costs $37 billion to use it. 
[02:47:00]  He's holding out.  He's holding out, though.  There's only going to be a few rich people around.  They do have a youth machine.  It's called Healthy Eating and Exercise.  Wow, Jimmy.  Fat smash diet, Jimmy?  That is profound.  Jimmy, are you finally fat smashing?  No, but what I've done is I eat – I've been giving up little things, like diet soda I gave up, and I also give up –  That is a little thing.  Well, no, no.  I mean, I don't eat that badly.  Diet soda you've given up?  Yes.  I don't eat that much.  Is it bad for you?  Apparently it is.  A lot of sugar. 
[02:47:30]  A lot of sugar.  And I also have in my – every day I would order from the Petergrill –  That's not too dieting.  In the Petergrill, I would order my food, and I would have this low-fat rice pudding, which is delicious, but I think it still puts some calories on, so now I've been foregoing that.  It's right to my thighs.  Oh, you know, moment on the lips, lifetime on the clit.  All right, let's get back to the audio.  People at the Gay Pride Parade, we're ready to go here.  Oh, Bill.  Second track is titled Gay Spanish Guy.  Okay, so I guess –  How did you know, Bill?  How did you know? 
[02:48:00]  I thought I wrote Gay Puerto Rican Guy, but I might have spelled it wrong.  Well, that's a hell of a way to spell Puerto Rican.  I know there's a U in there.  Anyway.  All right.  This guy's like a closet guy who came out or something.  All right.  Hey, on a scale of 1 to 10, how gay are you?  From 1 to 10, how gay I am.  I consider myself to be 5 from 1 to 10.  I could be 10, but I'm fine now.  So is that like bi?  Like 5 at a time.  It's gay, but probably more of a closet type of gay. 
[02:48:30]  Oh.  This will be the first time in a parade.  Was it hard coming out of the closet?  Hard to come in out?  It's a process.  You know, it's a lifetime process.  Was it hard to tell your parents?  Was it hard to tell my parents?  It's something we don't discuss about.  Something that we know from the beginning, and we respect that matter.  What do you think's safer, the Puerto Rican day parade or the gay parade?  Safer?  What do you mean by safer?  Least likely to get stabbed during or accosted. 
[02:49:00]  I'm from Puerto Rico, and I cannot make a comparison.  It's just a different type of setup.  Do you find the word faggot offensive?  Yes.  It could be offensive.  Even if it's used indirectly?  Like not at someone or maliciously?  No one a faggot, but sometimes I feel like calling faggots faggots.  It gets into your nerves to be a faggot.  I understand.  You mean like overly gay people?  They get overly, they exaggerate between ourselves, and they could get offensive in our own community.  It's weird. 
[02:49:30]  It's between us.  It's not, you know, that's the worst thing that we have to fight about.  I think that'll be all.  All right.  Skid marks to turn on?  A skid mark?  What is that?  I don't know that.  No, no, no.  Acquainted with that term.  That was it.  That was it.  Ed just chimed in.  Good boy, Ed.  Good dad.  It's all right.  You know what that guy sounds like now?  Now when I give a blowjob, the cum dribbles out my throat. 
[02:50:00]  It did not used to be like that.  You see in the commercial, he's got an alcohol swab, and he's cleaning out his asshole.  I can't swim because all the water goes into my culo, and the people are just laying there on the ground.  Oh, what are you, what are you, what are you, uh...  More corn tickets.  More corn tickets.  More corn tickets. 
[02:50:30]  My goodness.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll do...  Ooh, yeah!  Good gravy.  Maybe we'll do that tomorrow or later today.  Corn tickets.  Con.  Con!  All right, the next one.  What's the next one labeled?  Gay Ed.  Gay Ed?  Gay Ed?  Some guy named Ed.  What did he look like?  A big bear guy.  Fat guy.  Oh, a bear?  Hairy guy.  Was he big and hairy?  Yeah.  Do you have tattoos?  Did he drive a, uh...  He had like a son with him.  What's wrong? 
[02:51:00]  He just smelled something.  What's the matter?  What did he smell?  I don't know.  Are you kidding?  No.  Did he fart, Bill?  No.  All right, no, maybe it was just me.  I'm sorry.  Did someone just walk in and walk out?  You rock.  So, Gay Ed.  All right, here's Gay Ed.  Hey, what's your first name?  Ed.  Hey, Ed.  Okay, on a scale of one to ten, how gay are you?  Eleven.  All right, um...  Do you wish it was raining men right now?  Only on me. 
[02:51:30]  All right, what do you think would be safer?  The Gay Pride Parade or the Puerto Rican Day Parade?  Gay Pride, of course.  Why is that?  Everyone's just out here to basically have fun.  Uh, and it's a group of very diverse people that agree upon the same thing.  So, we're just here to have fun and show people that we can also be regular people.  Unlike the Puerto Rican Parade, which is more aggressive, right?  Correct.  All right, who do you think is a better-dressed community?  The gay community or the black community?  The gay community, of course. 
[02:52:00]  We have style.  Why is that?  Well, there's a lot of designers understanding, and of course, there's a lot of competition out there.  Do you think that Lance Armstrong's bracelets are gay?  I have no opinion on that.  Do you think Jesus was gay?  Jesus is everything anyone wants him to be.  Aw.  Correct.  All right, which of the following items do you think are...  Do you think the following items are gay or not?  iPods?  No.  Corn on the cob?  Could be.  Smoothies?  I don't get into smoothies.  I only get into fur.  Egg white omelets? 
[02:52:30]  Could be.  Bagels and seltzer?  Never.  Starbucks apple cake?  Absolutely.  And rollerblading.  Sure.  Thank you very much, Ed.  The boy, Bill.  Have a gay day.  Thanks.  Way to go, Bill.  Bagels and seltzer.  The Norton and Faggot Show.  That's what we should call this program.  That was a very funny line of questioning.  Yes, very nice.  It sounded offensive.  That took a fine turn.  Bill, at the Gay Pride Parade, the next track is listed as Gay Hipster Guy. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, yeah, this guy didn't seem to be liked, didn't like answering questions.  This guy looked a little too cool for the room.  Oh, really?  Jesus.  Hey, what's your name?  Just so, uh, first name.  Rick.  Mark.  Nick.  Rick.  R-I-C-K.  So I've noticed that you're gay.  On a scale from one to ten, how gay are you?  Ten.  Do you think Jesus was gay?  I don't think he was gay, but I think if Jesus, if he knew someone that was gay, he was going to forgive and love.  At what age did you decide to turn gay? 
[02:53:30]  I didn't turn gay.  I was born gay.  What was the first time you tried on your sister's clothing?  I never had, I don't have a sister.  What do you dislike about the gay community?  What do I dislike about it?  I'm too focused on youth and being young.  Once you hit 40, it's over.  Well, unless you have money and then you pay younger people to, you know, like you get a, uh.  No, no, no.  You love you?  No, not necessarily.  Because I'm pretty sure in the gay community also, money speaks volumes. 
[02:54:00]  Are skid marks to turn on or no?  I don't even know what that is.  It's, you know, a little, when you, you have a sneaker and you leave a skid mark on the floor?  Yeah.  What's turn on or?  No.  All right.  One more question.  Would you rather be black or gay?  No comment.  Thanks, man.  I'm starting to believe they don't know what a skid mark is.  How does he, uh, how do gay people not know what skid marks are?  None of them wear underpants.  Well, they've got to keep it nice and clean back there.  They don't, they don't have the skid mark problem.  It's always pushed up so deep it never reaches the underwear. 
[02:54:30]  That's fine.  Get back in there, you dappy bastard.  Or it gets cleaned out, so, like, instead of skid marks, every other cock looks like  it has a mohawk.  All right.  The final clip from Bill at the Gay Pride Parade.  By the way, Bill's doing a fine job.  Bill's.  You got balls, Bill. 
[02:55:00]  You got balls.  That's right.  And they were groped.  They certainly were.  I bet you Bill had his balls cupped gently a couple times.  You think?  A couple of these, like, eh.  This kid.  Jiggled a bit.  This kid.  Cop, cop, cop, cop, cop.  Gay man on rollerblades.  Oh.  How do you feel about the Catholic Church stands on marriage?  Gay marriage.  I think the greatest problem in our world today is fanaticism.  And the problem with the Catholic Church right now is the fact that it is so suppressed 
[02:55:30]  within its own environment and fear of homosexuality because of what has happened with the scandal  of the priest.  Do you think a good way to get back at the Catholic Church is to have a couple have gay sex in St.  Catholic Cathedral?  Cathedral, you dope.  To have sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral?  Show him a lesson.  What?  Show him a lesson. 
[02:56:00]  Well, I thought about it.  I think it's better to just go up to the crucifix and just, you know, my whole support is for  blowjobs for Jesus.  I think that my foundation, blowjobs for Jesus, will not be condemned.  No, I think that Jesus was homosexual.  I do want to say one thing.  I saw frescoes in Italy.  I go to Italy a lot for work.  I saw frescoes under a church that weren't supposed to be seen.  And on the frescoes, it shows John and Jesus almost, I mean, like a gay couple. 
[02:56:30]  Exactly.  Makes sense.  One last question.  I've noticed you're wearing rollerblades.  Is rollerblading an activity of the gay community?  No, I think it's an activity of any community.  I just do it to get around.  But mine are more fabulous, of course.  Bears or smoothies?  Bears or smoothies?  Smoothies.  Smoothies.  Only because I was a competitive athlete for most of my life. 
[02:57:00]  And I don't know.  I think we just all adhere to our own needs.  What would you rather have right now?  A fistful of $50 bills or a cold and full of fists?  Oh, God.  I like from the bottom of my heart to the heart of my bottom, I would like $50 bills because  I'm a pitcher, not a catcher.  Although I look like a catcher, I've been told.  Pitcher.  Oh, my God.  Not a catcher. 
[02:57:30]  Bill asked some tough questions.  He's got some extreme opinions on religion, that guy.  Bill, you did great.  You really did.  You're a ball.  That first question was Nathaniel's, that first question I usually open with.  I hear some Nathaniel questions in there.  Let me borrow that.  I liked his...  I hear some Nathaniel questions in there, yes.  I like that guy delving into Jesus and what was that?  Who did he say?  John?  Yeah.  It was like the Da Vinci load.  It was. 
[02:58:00]  Very nice.  The pushing.  Well, of course, we've got to end our gay discussion today with a fine little song.  Thank you, Bill.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  Bill.  Jim Gaffigan's here.  We're going to talk to him next about some movies.  Yeah, I think it's A New Kind of Wonderful, it's called.  I could be saying that wrong.  I'm doing it off the top of my head.  Is it a serious movie?  I think so.  I saw only a minute of it, and then let's just say someone showed up to massage me for  money.  Oh.  It's called The Great New Wonderful.  I'm sorry.  It's in New York City, Boston, and DC theaters now, other cities soon.  There's your girl. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, they just went to Cars.  Who's my girl?  Kate Beckinsale.  She's not my girl.  Her assistant never even called me back.  They probably heard us joking about it on the radio, and she probably said, this guy  thinks he's going to date you.  I doubt it was even Kate.  Oh, my God.  Look, you don't want to blame it on Kate.  You don't want to blame it on Kate.  You know what?  Because her sense of humor, I don't think she would have given a fuck.  I guarantee it was the fucking publicist or the assistant.  You're probably right, but I don't want to think it was.  I want to think it was her blowing you off.  I don't blame Kate.  Just dissing you.  I don't blame Kate. 
[02:59:00]  Let's call the publicist on the air.  Let's do it.  Can we get her on the phone?  Why can't we get Kate on the show?  Why didn't Kate show up at the cellar, and we want her on the show.  Tell her it's Jim Norton, and he wants to talk to her good friend.  Well, she wasn't technically, I can't say she stood me up, because she didn't technically  commit.  She said, we think we're around tomorrow night.  I just wish the assistant would have called me back if they couldn't make it.  That's fine.  You got the number of the assistant?  Let's get to the bottom of it.  I don't have it with me.  It's in my phone.  I don't have my phone with me.  I will have it tomorrow. 
[02:59:30]  Did you throw it against the wall, finally?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
[03:00:00]  What?  We're competing against Opie and Anthony as I speak.  Right now?  Right now we're competing against, or what, in like 10 minutes?  Five minutes?  Yeah, not yet.  All right.  In seven minutes there's a show called Opie and Anthony that we're going to be competing against.  Where is that going to be on?  It's going to be on WJFK.  Those hacks.  In D.C.?  In D.C.  It starts at 10 o'clock?  Yes. 
[03:00:30]  And they're calling themselves the Opie and Anthony show?  Yes, we're going to have to get the ONA pest involved.  Oh, my God.  We're competing with a show called Opie and Anthony.  Those midday flops.  We want them.  Yeah, right?  If they were so good, what are they doing in midday?  Absolutely.  At least change the name of the show.  That would be nice.  What do they do?  Are there any, like, bits?  What do they talk about?  Do they have comics on the show?  You know the mouse story I told this morning?  Yeah. 
[03:01:00]  I hear they got a mouse story today.  How convenient.  And this Anthony fella has house guests.  And guess what?  What?  He doesn't like kids or germs.  You know.  And gooey stuff?  Full-fledged attack on these hacks.  Rip-offs.  Hoo-hoo.  If you don't believe me, if you're in Washington, you got to tune in WJFK.  Don't give them...  Wait, you want to give them some kind of publicity?  Why not?  They suck.  I'm not afraid of them.  They suck.  Why not?  Why not?  Because what if our listeners hear them and like the show? 
[03:01:30]  We know we're better.  Good luck.  We know we're better.  That dog shit.  We know we're better, so we can do this.  Okay.  So someone down in the Washington area, tune in Opie and Anthony.  You want to get maybe somebody in D.C. to put their phone by the radio so we can hear  what these hacks sound like?  That's right.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I can't even say the name right.  I know, man.  What a weird...  What a stupid name.  Rolls right off the tongue.  How about you get a name you can pronounce like Opie and Anthony? 
[03:02:00]  Hacks.  That's stupid Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Another couple of rip-offs.  They're Opie and Anthony light.  Listen for yourself.  I bet you they don't curse or anything over there.  Probably don't.  Bunch of pussies.  Commercial radio faggots.  Bunch of pussies.  I can't wait to hear them now.  After the break, we'll listen...  Never even heard of them, to tell you the truth.  After this break, we'll listen to Opie and Anthony as they do their show.  All right.  Our new competition.  What's the Don and Mike audio?  It's right here.  It's pretty cool.  Where it's always been. 
[03:02:30]  Where it's been for the past two months.  I know.  But we started on WJFK today, so we've got to play the audio.  Huh?  Tie it in.  We end the gay discussion with good old Rick's Christopher Street song.  Jesus.  Damn it.  This is a damn funny song.  Yes.  This thing is just...  I've got to admit, it's just classic.  Why is Dan saying our acting stinks?  What?  Our acting happens to be very good, Dan.  Now Steve, on the other hand... 
[03:03:00]  That's right.  Oh my God.  What are you doing in my house?  Please can we play some Steve clips today of his fucking acting?  Yes, we can.  You and my motherfucking house.  So why don't we do this?  What, do you got Steve clips?  Just the one right now.  What is it?  Please?  Yeah.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You're an emotionless stiff asshole.  You're doing in my fucking house.  What's your motivation?  To suck. 
[03:03:30]  Mission accomplished.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  But I'm just trying to...  And you're getting fucking fixed.  He's just getting a little fucking manic.  All right, listen.  He's great.  The Opie and Anthony show is going to start up down there in Washington.  We've got to hear what they're up to today, right?  Yes.  But first, here's Rick's old song called Christopher Street. 
[03:04:00]  We're all gay, sticky, C, N, R, A.  T-cell's low, we've got the HIV.  It's a great way to lose some weight on our way to Christopher Street.  Dead in days, lesions all over my face. 
[03:04:30]  Pound my eggs and grab some A-Z-D.  You can watch my life wither away on our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street.  Okay, terrific.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Greg Opie Hughes.  Holy crap, my brain just exploded. 
[03:05:00]  Anthony Koeman.  Wrong idiot.  Bullshit.  James J. Norton.  Hi.  What a faggot.  You stay away from me, Jim Norton.  Fuck you.  Hurricane Ben.  Go, go, it's quick.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Martini Steve.  Cozy Lebanese fat thingers.  E-Rock.  E-Rock radio.  Shut up, Eric.  Who, who, who, who, who.  Right, Robin?  Rob, Ben.  I invented everything.  Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him, Fred.  Everybody.  Ski. 
[03:05:30]  All right.  Let's do a bit where we pretend we don't know around the air when we come back.  Let's try that.  No, that never worked.  Because we're such bad actors.  Let's say hi to Chris in D.C.  Speak for yourself.  We wouldn't know.  Chris.  What's up?  Wait until we go back on the air.  I just had to bust you guys out on this about a couple months ago, 
[03:06:00]  and it's too bad we remember all this shit.  You guys were making fun of people that do middays,  and people who generally do middays have no talent at all.  Well, welcome to D.C. Midday.  We know.  You want to bust us out on that?  Okay, I'm a faggot.  I'm sorry.  Chris.  You know how easy that's to explain?  First of all, if we were doing middays all over America, whatever.  We're doing morning radio, and then we're picking up some middays in other cities,  and there's a reason for that because it's called warming up in the bullpen. 
[03:06:30]  You ass.  Didn't we just acknowledge the fact that perhaps a show that is very similar to ours is doing middays?  I want to hear about Anthony on WJFK.  Could someone please tune them in?  We got sports junkies in the morning.  They didn't do very well, and not a mic in the afternoon to do very well.  Yes.  What are they doing?  And we're not doing middays.  We're on in the morning.  Yeah.  There's some hacks over there that have ripped off our entire act that we're competing against. 
[03:07:00]  And then when we do this midday discussion, then, of course, they go, well, Ron and Fez do middays.  Ron and Fez are not midday hacks.  It's okay if you have a gay person on your show to do middays, by the way.  That seems to be the ruling.  Hey, Fez.  Hey, I'm here.  Ron and Fez, brilliant, and they're warming up in the bullpen as well.  Hey, Fez.  Unfortunately, they've been warming up a really long time, but they are warming up in the bullpen for bigger and better things. 
[03:07:30]  But everything was put on hold for now.  And that's all we can say.  I'm wearing the headphones.  I love when you say that.  Well, if you weren't, you know, gay.  What?  Hey.  Starting Monday, Opie and Anthony are on Free FM.  We're squeezing in between the junkies and Don and Mike.  Opie and Anthony, yay.  Welcome back.  We missed you.  On Free FM, 106.7 WJFK.  Oh, I'm all energetic. 
[03:08:00]  BCN, better production.  Uh-oh.  Well, I just want to make them try a little harder.  Oh, boy.  How about we have a full day there first?  All right.  Let's get Jim Gaffigan in here, and we'll talk about the new movie, The Great New Wonderful.  What is that?  I don't know.  What the hell is it?  It's Jim Gaffigan.  Here he comes.  Jim Gaffigan.  He's all over everywhere.  I see him on every commercial that's ever on TV now, ever, ever. 
[03:08:30]  You're like on everything.  What are you watching?  I'm only on one.  You're on, like, no, it's one, like, thing.  It's one product.  But there's 20 commercials for it.  And they bought a huge schedule because it's everywhere.  It's everywhere.  Hold on a minute.  We got to miss Jim.  We got to break into this for a second because there's a show down in Washington, Opie and  Anthony.  Oh, really?  And we're competing against them.  Oh, that?  Yeah, because we're on right now.  That's BS.  See, we're on live.  You're seeing us broadcast.  And there's this other show that's doing what we do down in Washington. 
[03:09:00]  And people say it's a little too similar, the two shows.  Let's say hi to Dan in D.C.  Dan.  Dan.  Fellas, what's up?  Hey, look.  These fucking hacks are chomping at your material.  You really should listen.  Ripping us off.  All right.  This is...  Let's hear this crap.  This always happens in radio.  Let's listen to Opie and Anthony on WJFK.  It's been a little longer since, you know, it's not in the morning.  Yeah, we're in afternoons, I guess.  Simulcast?  Yeah.  Simulcast, whatever you would call it.  We're...  Yeah, whatever. 
[03:09:30]  So, we expect food from Cleveland tomorrow morning.  But I thought you guys were...  It's a little hostage for food.  So, thank you to everybody listening to us in Cleveland.  Oh, really, man?  We're on in Cleveland, too.  They even sound like us.  I thought you guys were joking.  No, this is Opie and Anthony.  They even sound like we do.  This is coming...  If you listen to JFK, WJFK in Washington right now, you're going to hear these two idiot  rip-offs that sound exactly like us, do the same material. 
[03:10:00]  It looks like they figured out how to get free food through their radio show.  Right.  Just like us.  Dan?  What else do they do?  Dan?  They got this...  I think they have this thing.  It's like on Wednesdays.  It's a wow.  If they do wow on Wednesdays, I swear I'll rip their eyes out.  Let me hear a little more of them.  All right.  All right.  Sure, sure.  And could you talk in a higher voice, please?  No kidding.  Without gay sex or anything, it's kind of like that.  It's just like that without the stitches. 
[03:10:30]  Right.  Without laying in the sick bay that they got over there on your stomach going...  That's pretty funny.  No, it's not.  Yeah.  Kind of like that.  Oh, guys.  Terrible.  So, you know, we got to say hi to everybody listening to us on WJFK.  And there's a fine article in the Washington Post.  We had an article in the Post today.  But they were very, very friendly and nice, and they wrote a fine comeback.  Oh, my God, Opie.  If this guy isn't trying to sound exactly like you. 
[03:11:00]  The WJFK sounds a lot like Howard Stern.  Who?  Ooh.  Jesus.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  Peace out, pal.  Can we wait until we can hear the Opie guy try to read?  I think you guys should be flattered.  At least we'll have an excuse if we bomb in Washington.  We're competing with ourselves.  We're competing against ourselves.  We kicked our ass.  What?  Wouldn't they just add the ratings?  Yeah, just add it together.  That makes perfect sense. 
[03:11:30]  Like, what do you do if you're in your car right now and you got XM and WJFK?  I know.  Which Opie and Anthony are you listening to?  What do you listen to?  That's how good we are.  You get us, or you can have us.  Yeah, us or us.  All depends.  It's a little bizarre, no?  That is odd.  It's really arrogant.  If we had it our way, we would just be on every station, replayed constantly, and still  think it's interesting.  We are working on that, aren't we?  Idiots we are.  Yes, we are.  No choices.  Dude, that's sad.  That's a real sign of lack of success for you guys.  We're failing all over the place. 
[03:12:00]  We've been failing for a long time now.  The only problem with getting so many markets and actually getting ratings means we'll be  there longer to expose our failure to so many more people for such a longer period  of time than if we had bad ratings or never were syndicated.  I hate this failure.  It's dangerous.  It really is.  The devil's watching you.  Yes.  So, Jim, you're in this movie called The Great New Wonderful?  The Great New Wonderful.  The Great New Wonderful.  It doesn't sound like a comedy, is it?  Well, it's a drama with a comedy element. 
[03:12:30]  Is it a true story or no?  No, no, no.  It's five stories of New Yorkers that are inadvertently affected by 9-11.  Isn't one of them a story of two guys?  I think one is Tracy Morgan and you're trying to get his soda?  Yes, that is one of them.  And that is one of them.  Tracy Morgan's in it.  I love the continuing storyline between you, Tracy.  Who else is in those commercials?  What other people wanted lots of money? 
[03:13:00]  Let's see.  Exactly.  I just watched those and I'm like, look at Jim now.  But now he's playing kind of a different guy.  I'll tell you.  Sometimes you're someone's husband and then sometimes you're just a friend.  There's no continuity.  I can change my shell.  It kills me.  I can change my shell and eat different things.  I can see that.  But the soda is the common thread.  That is the thread.  Through the whole thing.  It's little stories, if you will.  Yes.  Vignettes.  I can't wait until they release a DVD of all the Sierra Mist commercials.  Yeah, I want to see the director's cut. 
[03:13:30]  Here's the point now.  Here's the point where Tracy, thinking he's going to give it to one of the friends at the ballgame,  sells it to the guy behind him.  I know.  You never know where it's going.  You don't.  I think it's up for writing.  It should be.  It's up there.  An Emmy for writing.  Because people actually mistake them for a soap opera or some type of show.  Well, it's a sit commercial.  That's what they tell us.  It's a sit commercial.  Okay.  That sounds a little too true. 
[03:14:00]  And I'm always kind of like, where's the check?  No, it is a sweet gig.  It's just like we do it for a week and we just kind of play.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you'll know each other.  Commercials have been very good to me.  Yeah.  Fucking Gabby.  You pop up in so many of them.  Everything commercial-wise.  It's sweet.  It's like, where would you like me to play dumb?  Because I'll play that.  You got it.  He's a dumb white guy.  But, you know, and some commercials are just embarrassing.  You never know.  But, like, I feel like the Sierra Miss commercials, they're all right. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  They definitely are all right.  They are.  And, like I said, funny comics, you know who they are.  You know?  Yeah.  You know who you guys are and stuff.  I only saw the opening scene of this because, again, somebody came over.  I settled down to watch it and I forgot I had company coming.  Wait, we got advanced copies of this?  Well, let's just say I had one.  I had one given to me.  Oh, geez, that's good.  Wow.  Well, you had to tell the guy in the movie about the bootleg.  And then the prostitute showed up and he was like, yeah, I'll put this away.  If only, Jim, if only you knew, you hit the proverbial nail on the head.  All right, I'm going to hide any O&A stuff here, too. 
[03:15:00]  But Gaffigan's scene is he's got a little monologue in the beginning where he's talking  to a psychiatrist and, like, I like the room setting.  It's just an awful little room.  It's like a cafeteria, like a, what is it, a break room in a company?  Totally.  And it's like the psychiatrist is telling Jim that he's suppressing rage, which I've  always felt about Gaffigan anyway.  That's true.  Yeah, no, that's the funny thing.  It's like all the comics are like, so you play a guy that explodes at the end.  How's that different from your, in everyday life? 
[03:15:30]  That's sad.  There's a lot of vulnerability inside of me.  Yeah, because Jim's very, like, very laid back.  You just know it's something going on there.  He was a wrestler, man.  Gaffigan was a wrestler, correct?  There's a big tumor inside of me somewhere.  We're going to find it.  We're going to find it one day.  Yes.  You can tell this guy has rage when he happens.  Oh, Gaffigan's a fucking, look at the size of his forearms.  He's a fucking problem white guy.  It's weird.  I was like an athlete.  I was an athlete all my life, and then when I started doing stand-up, everyone was like,  you're the nerd! 
[03:16:00]  I'm like, really?  What happened?  I was the jock.  It's weird.  It's strange.  Are you a strong guy?  I'm strong on the inside.  No, I think, I was relatively strong, I guess.  I don't know.  How many years did you wrestle?  What is it, on the playground now?  How strong are you?  How strong are you?  I just want to know how much you could lift.  I could, I could, I could, I could up to like 400 at one point.  No, I don't, I don't even remember.  I used to, I remember during the days when you used to know how much you could bench.  It used to be, when it was important.  I was kind of like, 300 club! 
[03:16:30]  Just, ah, broke 300.  300 club!  Hey, nice, huh?  Yeah.  You ever need someone to spot you, you know, put their balls in your mouth while you're  lifting, give me a call.  Yeah.  It is, that's, like, you go to the gym, and that is like the last vestige of the playground.  You go there, and there's always some guy who's like, I'm stronger than you, and you're  like, yeah, but you live in your car.  You know what I mean?  I could beat you up, man.  I could, I could totally take that guy over there. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, I guess you could.  I don't know.  I love the guys, uh, hey, can you give me a spot?  Give me a spot?  Give me a spot.  And then you don't even care about this guy, you just want to get your dumb workout in.  It's like, I'm trying to get strong over here.  Next thing you know, next thing you know, you're cheering on some stranger as he tries-  Come on, one more!  Right, as he tries to get 250, 260 up, and you're like, I don't even know this guy, and I'm  now cheering him on, because he needed a spot.  There's like a-  And then you have to go, very good, and he goes, thanks, and then you get to go back to  what you were doing, and then you meet in a locker room.  It's a strange social environment that exists in health clubs anyway. 
[03:17:30]  You know what I mean?  It's just like, you can't talk.  Like, everyone has headphones on if you, like, ask a woman how long she's going to be on  a machine.  She's like, I got a boyfriend.  And you're like, look, just get off that Treadmaster so I can be less fat for a week.  I got a boyfriend.  I just think it's weird they even give you those membership cards, because I don't even  like to work out, but, like, that membership card, you know, they had to do that, because  there were actually people sneaking in to work out, which is just pathetic. 
[03:18:00]  It's like, yeah, I'm going to, you know, I might get arrested, but I'm going to try and  break into crunch.  I'm going to give it a shot.  I love the women that walk around with their pocketbooks from machine to machine, and you're  sitting there like, hey, they get ripped off.  You can't put your pocketbook anywhere.  You shouldn't bring a pocketbook to the gym.  Girls need pocketbooks.  Then you'll see some women in, like, full-on makeup and stuff like that.  Oh, yeah, it's a social thing.  Actually, we make fun of a girl at my gym that does exactly that.  She's got clown makeup on. 
[03:18:30]  And my mommy got ripped off her pocketbook at the gym.  Ripped off from her car.  A pocketbook.  There's a whole thing, and they even warned the people in the gym, which is why I wanted  to wrap my mother in the head.  I go, you were warned about this.  She goes, yeah, they did an announcement and said that the parking lot, the cars are  being broken into and valuables are being taken.  And I go, and so you left your pocketbook.  She goes, well, I put it under the seat.  Well, if someone's watching a woman that's obviously going to the gym come out of her car 
[03:19:00]  without a pocketbook, they're going to break into your car knowing that women have  pocketbooks, and yours is probably in there.  She probably left the straps to get out.  Where is she working out?  Yeah.  We're like...  I know.  She works out in the Bronx.  Yeah, I know.  She's doing chin-ups in a sweaty board of Apache or something.  Did you wish your mom a happy birthday?  Yes, I did.  My stupid brother made me look like an ass.  He called up Ron and Fez.  We got off the air.  Joe was in San Diego.  So the time difference, he thought we were still on the air. 
[03:19:30]  So he calls up, and Ron and Fez are on, and he proceeds to tell them that he called  to remind me to tell my mommy happy birthday.  Like, I didn't remember.  So then Ron and Fez, of course, took it in the spirit which it deserved and completely  goofed on me.  And Fez, he's calling Joe the good son because he remembered.  And he's got to call up the bad son that doesn't.  She is so hot.  I remember.  She really is sexy.  Don't call my mom.  She's so hot.  Stop it.  And so young.  She is not. 
[03:20:00]  You get a sexy kid.  No, I don't mean that.  I mean, she acts young, and she, you know.  She works out.  She works out.  She works out like an animal.  I saw pictures of her on whackbag.com.  That's great.  Pictures of my mom are on whackbag.  Isn't that wonderful?  She went down to F.H. Riley's Saturday for the Big Big A No Filter Paul birthday party.  My brother bent over backwards for No Filter Paul and Big A.  You know, my brother's restaurant. 
[03:20:30]  Wow, that is a gift.  400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  Yeah.  And fucking Paul left $20 to the bartenders after drinking all night long.  That cheap, limey prick left $20.  Not only was he drinking all night long for free, because my brother is so much nicer than me.  He's like, he basically told everyone, look, No Filter Paul and Big A drink for free all night.  And if they want to buy a drink every once in a while, that's fine.  According to my brother, like, Paul is buying shots for the entire bar. 
[03:21:00]  And I'm not getting charged for it.  Yeah, of course.  So the bartender's fucked up and No Filter Paul fucked up.  We're trying to run a business.  We're going to be out of business if we have people like No Filter Paul.  Was the bartender annoyed?  Of course.  At the end of the night, he's hammering.  He goes, well, thanks for taking care of me all night.  And he hands over $20 and goes, is this good enough?  And they didn't know what to do.  A $20.  I'd have chewed it up and spit it in his face.  When I tell you this guy got to drink for $20, I mean, for free for hours and was buying shots for everybody. 
[03:21:30]  He should have given, what, $50 or $100, right?  A little more than that, at least $21.  If you're drinking free the whole night, if they tell you, by the way, you can drink free,  it doesn't mean you open up the whole bar to your friends.  But, you know, if the bartender's hooking you up, you're supposed to tip him all the money that you would pay for the drink.  Right, right.  It's just kind of like...  They don't know you from a hole in the wall.  And then if you take advantage of that and start, like, inviting people in, then you really better take care of that bartender. 
[03:22:00]  Totally, if you're buying drinks for other people.  Just to shut him up for nothing else so he doesn't go to the owner and go, this guy, free drinks, he's the guy that drained the whole fucking bar.  How much did a big A tip?  No filter, Paul.  Oh, please.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How much money did you tip?  I don't remember.  I don't know.  Oh, now he's claiming alcohol blackout.  I remember.  The bartenders remember.  My brother remembers.  $20.  I didn't come out of my wallet.  You cheap limey.  No, you walked up to the bar and said, is this good?  And you handed over $20. 
[03:22:30]  That wasn't me.  I don't...  I don't...  I would have...  I would have tipped more if I didn't...  But you said you don't remember.  I don't remember.  You don't remember.  It wasn't him.  He would have tipped more if he had it.  What the fuck kind of excuse is that?  I don't have an excuse.  I was...  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Sonny Pirelli's in on this.  Sonny Pirelli.  Hey, fucking Paul.  You're a cheap fucking motherfucker.  I'll tell you.  I was at FH Riley's last week, man.  My bill came out to $26.  I gave the fucking bar made a $20 tip. 
[03:23:00]  Well, you're an overcompensating psychopath.  Compensating.  You know, fuck it.  I thought you meant to go back down there and take care of everybody.  I was...  At a breadstick.  I gave him $383.  That's right.  He'll love me.  Paul.  Yes.  How many drinks did you buy for other people?  It was only right at the end of the night.  We did a bunch of Jager shots.  Before that, I did not buy any drinks for anyone.  You know my brother is not rich like me. 
[03:23:30]  He's not a rich guy.  Who is?  You know that my brother hasn't made a dollar off that restaurant yet?  He's scraping by and he's got to buy all your freaking shots?  Your brother is the nicest guy in the world.  I don't even know how he's related to you.  His brother!  He's a nice guy, but he doesn't want to be taken advantage of, Paul.  Yeah, his brother is a nice guy.  We're trying to run a...  His brother.  He's trying to run a business down there. 
[03:24:00]  Absolutely.  He can't afford to be buying, you know, shots for everybody.  We did.  We did.  We went through one bottle of Jager.  That's all we went through.  One bottle of Jager.  A bottle?  There's like 800 shots.  I know.  How many shots are in a bottle?  Did Big A tip at all?  Of course not.  You know that one bottle of Jager?  I'm not in the business, but that's a few hundred dollars that he can easily use at this point?  Let's get Big A on the phone, too.  We're in the middle of summer.  The restaurant is really, really slow.  All of Huntington's really, really slow. 
[03:24:30]  And my brother's like, I got to be honest with you, man.  You know, first of all, my brother loves the fans because they don't cause any problems and they're really cool.  But he's like, you know, we should have made a little extra money, but I'm hearing that Paul was just buying, you know, shots and drinks for everybody in the place.  Don't call me cheap no more.  Officer, call me.  Because he was nice enough to say that you could drink for free for your birthday.  He's not even listening to you.  Look, he's talking.  My wife's saying, I'm telling you, she's like, I tip 20.  I'm like, I think that's the problem. 
[03:25:00]  You tip $20 and you guys wonder why I hate your guts.  I would never hang out with people like you.  Ever.  Why'd you tip 20 bucks?  I don't know why my brother would.  I don't remember any of this.  That's what I'm telling you.  You tip $20?  The party was for you.  You were drinking for free and you were allowed to, well, you weren't allowed, but you decided to take advantage.  And you bought shots for everybody in the area and you tipped $20?  I just said, I don't remember any of it. 
[03:25:30]  You go back there and apologize and give him money.  And there's a misconception because, you know, yes, yeah, I'm making a lot of money doing radio now.  Yes.  My brother is scraping by.  My brother hasn't taken a paycheck from that joint yet.  It's not like he's made of money like, oh, this is cool.  Don't worry about it.  He's too nice.  Absolutely.  My brother was panicking as he goes, you should see how many empty bottles of beer we have here and, you know, something's not, you know, matching up. 
[03:26:00]  I guess.  A $20 tip?  Are you fucking kidding me?  That wasn't me.  I totally lost track.  You leave a $20 tip like in a diner.  Yeah.  It's like a diner tip.  You went through a whole, yeah.  I don't know why people are giving 20 bucks.  You went through them just for hanging out.  I'm that generous.  Just for, like, being.  Someone sneezes, I give them to you.  Hold on.  Bless you.  You went through a whole bottle of Jägermeister, which means you not only went through a whole bottle of Jägermeister,  I guarantee there were beers and drinks as well that wasn't paid for, okay? 
[03:26:30]  And you're tipping $20.  It wasn't me.  I don't remember.  Do you understand how ridiculous that is?  We're getting a gift with Brett and then we were sending him a thank you gift.  A gift.  He needs money to pay his bills.  What?  Maybe it's a gift of hundreds.  A gift of what?  You're going to get him a little tchotchke?  He doesn't need tchotchkes.  What gift do you mean?  Yeah, what gift?  We haven't decided yet, but we're trying to figure out.  Well, I decided. 
[03:27:00]  How about cold, hard cash?  Yeah, no tchotchke.  And then he's making extra money on my expense on top of it.  How's that?  Sonny.  I do this pest poker thing every week, you know?  And then he decided.  He doesn't have to fucking play the game of fucking poker in his life.  And then he decided he's going to be associated with full-tilt poker and fucking make money off of my deal.  Sonny.  That's my deal, Wade.  Sonny, I know you don't drink.  And I know you hate Paul's, but you got to keep it real.  Did you see him buying drinks for people? 
[03:27:30]  Or free drinks for people?  I wasn't there this Saturday.  Oh, that's right.  You were, okay.  You're talking about last week when I saw you there.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I don't even fucking drink, and I gave the fucking bartender a $20 tip.  Someone's saying you get 30 shots and a bottle of Jaeger.  If he's admitting one bottle of Jaeger, trust me.  We all know how human nature is.  That means it was a hell of a lot more than that.  No, that was the only thing that got shared with other people.  I did not take advantage of.  Oh, I did not take advantage.  I left him a $20.  I'll tow Bitterman to pay the rest. 
[03:28:00]  I'll tell you this much.  You limey, drunk, cheapo.  Exactly.  You skinplint.  Paul, I'll tell you this much.  The bartender said you tipped $20, or Denise did, whatever.  And they're swearing that you were just buying shots and drinks for people left and right.  And you weren't buying it because every time you went to the bar, you got free drinks because my brother's that nice.  Exactly.  That didn't start until about 2.30.  It was a bottle of Jaeger, and that's all it was. 
[03:28:30]  Brett.  Don't joke.  Have No Filter Paul call you?  Oh.  Or do you want to call the show?  Yep.  Do it on the air.  Yeah.  All right, hold on a minute.  My brother's standing by.  No, Brett's calling.  Yeah, hold on.  I don't know which one he called from.  Hold on.  Sorry about this.  How do you got to do that now?  Hold on. 
[03:29:00]  Meep, meep, meep, meep, meep.  Oh, shit.  Hold on.  He's got to transfer the call.  Put it on.  Sorry.  Hold on.  No, I'm trying to get the number for Travis.  But then.  Because I don't know the number offhand.  Who knows numbers in this day and age?  They're all on the phone.  How about you give him the phone.  Jesus.  All right.  There you go.  Paul, you're pissed off my brother, and he's like one of the nicest guys in my family.  Yeah, 20 bucks.  He's absolutely the nicest guy.  I openly admit I'm not.  Well, I am a nice guy in my real life, but no one gives a shit about that. 
[03:29:30]  Trust me.  It's what I do on the radio.  The actor that plays Ophi on the radio.  He shows up in real life a lot, too.  Funny, that's where you're a real method actor.  Sonny, I've got to let you go for now, because I'm going to need the other phone, all right?  All righty, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Yep.  Yeah, Sonny, when he goes to FH Riley's, he's very appreciative, and he takes care of everybody around him.  Right.  No filter Pauls, but I would do too.  He doesn't get drunk and not even know what's going on, so I'm not even going to discuss that. 
[03:30:00]  It's pathetic.  Just trying to get in there and get the freebie.  You tightwad.  Jim, we'll get back to you.  You're a big movie star.  I'm going to sample.  We've got to iron some shit out of you.  It has to be settled.  This skinflint.  Skinflint.  This pinch penny.  Paul.  Paul, did my brother bend over backwards for you?  Absolutely.  All right.  Well, here he is, the owner of FH Riley's, my brother, Brett.  Brett.  Brett, how you been? 
[03:30:30]  What up?  What's happening, man?  What's up, guys?  Paul out there?  Yeah, yeah.  Paul is right there.  You are speaking to him.  Brett.  Paul, hold on a sec.  First of all, you guys got like the best fans ever in the whole freaking world, man.  When they come out here, they have a great time.  No one causes any problems.  Everyone gets along.  They all help out.  Brett, did we have a most amazing night?  You did such a wonderful job for us.  I really, really appreciate it.  And we're going to-  Yeah, you really appreciated it.  20 bucks.  And we're going to come and take care of everybody. 
[03:31:00]  It would have been an amazing night if my brother could have counted some, like, actual real money in the cash register.  You're going to go broke.  Well, I don't-  I'm not going to discuss what he made.  You know, he-  That's his business, you know?  Yeah, that's his business.  Yeah, it's obviously not yours.  You didn't consider him.  He's all polite.  Well, you know, I don't want to be rude.  Someone discuss his business.  You can't get-  You can't get a kid in the car for 20 bucks anymore.  But you can get a black one.  It's not really about the money and all that.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[03:31:30]  Pretty funny.  I love how that was crossing my line.  Hey.  Here's my brother.  Go, bro.  All right.  Brett.  It's not really about the money and all that.  You know, of course, it helps when you're trying to run a business and stuff.  I volunteered a whole entire party for No Filter and Big A.  Big A rocks, man.  What a great guy.  Really nice guy.  And Paul, here we go.  There's no question about it.  But I also often throw out a buffet for the guys and all that kind of stuff.  A late-night buffet for people out of hammering and fill up on food.  And maybe get home safe and whatnot.  So, you know, I did some extra things. 
[03:32:00]  I went up to No Filter, Paul, and even Big A's.  Drinks around me, guys.  Tear it up.  Happy birthday.  You know?  Big A's as well?  Meaning the drinks for the two guys.  Right.  Paul and, yeah.  But Brett even said yay.  Then I told the bartenders, like, you know, they come up to the bar.  They got their girl with them.  They got a buddy.  They got whatever.  Even a super fan, man.  Just toss them a shot.  I was also offering $2 mirror lights and also $2 house shots,  which actually were made with Absolute Peach and the Homets and other things.  Because we don't really use the cheap crap here. 
[03:32:30]  And, you know, he took a couple shots here and there.  And then one point I just watched what looked like a choo-choo train of shots  across the bar of Jägermeister.  Yeah, that was Jägermeister.  I was like, what the fuck?  So I pulled the bartender aside.  I'm like, look, I told you guys.  One, not a problem.  Two, not so much problem.  But when you got 10, 12 of them lined across the bar and everyone's saluting,  that's a big problem.  Oh, brother.  So I pulled the bartender aside and I started getting on them.  And they were like, look, he's screaming at us.  He's telling us, I want my drink.  I want this.  I want that.  And I got a little bit terrified by that. 
[03:33:00]  So I walked away because, you know, I love all the fans and stuff.  And, you know, I love my brother's death.  And I don't want to cause no problems with the guys.  Then as I'm walking away, Paul in his little birthday hat comes running after me.  Where's the buffet?  Where's my free buffet?  I want my buffet.  And that's what really put me over the top.  I'm like, it's coming, Paul.  It's coming.  Relax, relax.  Have a good time.  It's coming.  But everyone's leaving.  All my guests are leaving.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, so I'm in the kitchen now.  I'm trying to get all the food out and stuff, which I want to do around one or two.  Because you know people are going to be hammered when you're at a big party. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  And the best time is when you're getting ready to leave, fill up in food, you know, absorb that alcohol and stuff.  I'm not going to put it out at 10 o'clock.  It's not like a Jewish wedding or something like that, which kind of seemed like it turned into.  And then you're the last ones here and the bartender's tired and they're trying to get out of here.  And Paul wanders up to the bar and he's like, nondiscreetly, hey, is this 20 bucks good for you?  Even my bartender looked at me.  I didn't do that.  Yeah, you did.  Even the bartender.  I was my wife with Denise.  I know she just told me.  I never even knew she left anything.  I fully intended to come back down there. 
[03:34:00]  You guys did a wonderful job.  Tell me about me.  Tell me about me making money and all that.  It's about my employees and all that.  I'm not a Jew.  I will absolutely pay for one.  Every one of those shows.  A Jew?  Here's a bigger shovel for that hole.  You know what I find interesting?  He was leaving.  He was like, I was going to come back later on.  Because that's what you do.  You always tip a couple days after.  You tip after.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like he doesn't even live close to the place. 
[03:34:30]  You should just come straight and just go, you know, I fucked up.  But no, he'll never do that.  It's always, I'm not a Jew.  You know, trying to make a bigger problem so this one's forgotten.  You know, there wasn't any holocaust.  You know, it never happened.  So, Brett, did he just politely ask once about the buffet?  No, he was up my ass about it.  I feel like I was catering to some Jewish man who was trying to give a wedding to his daughter.  It's all about the Jews, suddenly.  What did the Jews do? 
[03:35:00]  Yes.  So they're out there for this.  The Jews like to eat.  They certainly do.  All the Jewish people in the car are going, what the hell's happened?  What did we do?  I wasn't even there.  Controlling Hollywood in the media?  All right, we'll take that one.  No, I'm trying to enjoy myself and have a good time, too, because I love rocking with all of you guys and all the fans and stuff.  And this guy has me running around like I've never run around before ever in the business.  Like he's a paying customer. 
[03:35:30]  Like he's a Jew.  I knew we wanted to make a big nut off the night.  It wasn't all about that.  It was, you know, promotions.  And actually a good time, man, because those guys, I'm telling you, the fans, when they come down to the best.  Well, you want your guy taken care of, too.  The bartender, you've got to tip the guy.  I mean, yeah.  Right, because they're very loyal to me, and I try to be as loyal to them.  I'm like, look.  What night was it, too?  I'm virtually loyal this past Saturday night.  It's Saturday night.  That's the night you make all the money.  Yep.  No Phil DePaul is now officially Mr. Pink.  I don't tip. 
[03:36:00]  It's their fucking job.  Well, the one thing the bartender, he is like shop specials and drink specials and all that, because, you know, people are going to come with very little money and, you know, maybe leave with $2 on the bar.  So they're a little pissed I was doing something like that and giving them a lot away.  I said, look, they'll take good care of you.  Trust me.  They're great guys.  I really, really trust me.  I put my, you know, I basically put my honor on the line, and then Dez walks up to me and goes, the motherfucker just handed me $20.  Yeah, but.  I go, how much did she hand the other bartender? 
[03:36:30]  And she laughed.  She goes, no.  Oh, wait.  That means that he handed me $10 and the other bartender $10.  I was like, you've got to be fucking.  Now, he should have thrown like $100, right?  And he's anti-Semitic.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  $100.  I don't really care.  You know, if I make some money, I make some money, but it's not about that.  It's about, you know, they're like my family.  They're my friends and all that.  That's what's really about.  Yeah, the bartender alone should have gotten a C-note right there.  Absolutely.  He went through almost two bottles.  Yeah, you're.  Paul's agreeing.  Yeah.  Paul didn't do it, though. 
[03:37:00]  Absolutely.  He's like, absolutely.  He's like bad-mouthing himself.  Absolutely.  And I was so gone.  I apologize, Brad.  He was gone.  You're the nicest guy in the world.  No, I don't want to.  No, it's not me that wants to.  No, I understand.  It's all about the, like, Dez and Mike.  You would absolutely be taking care of those guys.  No, I already took care of them.  That's the point.  I already took care of them because I do the right thing.  It's a tuppence.  God, man.  I would absolutely take care of you.  The last thing I'm going to do is leave anyone dry.  I'd rather shoot myself in the foot.  But, you know, you.  Man.  You made a pretty blatant, like. 
[03:37:30]  And she even looked at you, like, you're serious.  And you're like, what?  What?  And you turn around and you walked away.  Dude.  Oh, wait, wait, Brett.  I had a way back from pummeling you.  The guy said, are you serious?  So Paul didn't just say, is this good enough?  And the guy went, yeah.  He said, are you serious?  Are you kidding?  Yeah, she looked at him like, and if anyone knows this, man.  That is not true.  It was not me.  It was Denise.  I did not have anything.  I was fucking outpicking.  He's like, I didn't even consider pipping.  But when we started this conversation, you don't even remember anything.  I don't remember anything.  Maybe we were lucky enough to get $40 out of you.  $20 from Denise and $20 from you. 
[03:38:00]  She had the girl with the black hair and with the little white.  The little bit on her head.  The $20 bill.  We didn't even talk to the guy.  So that was not me.  Well, he's a bartender, man.  He's helping out all your guests that you invited.  Is it a no filter, Paul?  Is it true that at one point Brett came up to you to ask about your tab and you hit him over  the head with a bottle and told him, get the fuck out of here?  We would be having a totally different conversation.  Trust me.  Paul was saying earlier.  He didn't even tip at all.  Paul, what do you actually, up to one point, do you remember the night then? 
[03:38:30]  I remember bits after about one o'clock.  I do remember the Jager bottle.  Absolutely.  Two Jager bottles.  And then the next thing I remember waking up 11 o'clock in the morning.  Remember the Jews.  So, Brett, do you remember bossing the slave around to get your food to you there, Massa?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was cost of the Bambino, the only black kid.  Hey, Brett, so it was two Jager bottles?  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  Depending on that, we charge anywhere from $4 to $4.50, $5 a shot.  How many shots of the Jager bottle?  They're saying about $30.  Yeah, about $30.  Wow.  We got a good shot here.  That was close to $300 worth of shots for everybody there, Paul.  I think you should show up with one of those Lexus cars with a ribbon on top.  Yeah, I know.  Wait a minute.  The worst part of all this, if all this happens, he's on my bar screaming at me to give him  another bath, you fucking bastard.  And I'm looking at him.  Oh, if you know anything about any of us, you know, once someone starts talking down to 
[03:39:30]  us, especially when we went way out of our way, it's almost go time.  I'm looking at him holding on to a vodka bottle, like I'm a little bit closer, Paul.  Oh, you'd have been a hero, Brett.  I tried doing that.  What?  I can't hear you.  I tried doing the whisper over the bar.  Yeah, to get him in a little closer?  My old Jags.  He would not come into the net.  What was he asking for?  A bass, another pint of bass.  Oh, bass, okay.  And we called last call, like, look, last call, everyone's out.  And this was after he left his tip.  I'm like, last call, that's it.  Everyone get the F.  It was only four people.  It was him, his wife, who's a sweetheart, and another couple. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, I can't wait for her to leave you, Paul.  I mean, to be honest with you, she is a very nice lady.  You're an ass.  Hey, Paul, do you remember yelling at me about the bass thing?  You want another pint of bass?  I thought it was half I was drinking.  What's that?  Wasn't it half I was drinking?  I don't fucking remember.  Oh, go have your birthday somewhere else next year, Paul.  Wow.  I'll take care of Brett.  Don't you worry.  No, no, don't.  Hopefully, family will be visiting his plot next birthday.  It's all taken care of.  Yeah, it's all...  I'm not even there for bad taste in your mouth or my mouth. 
[03:40:30]  I will be down there, and I will absolutely take care of it.  It's too late, Paul.  I am not a typical...  Too late.  You're going to go two hours to give another $20?  Yeah.  Keep your $20.  Another $20.  I am like $100, and that's what he's going to get.  I got to say, he's a little bit into the attention thing, because Big A is cool.  It's his party, too, but Big A wasn't...  Maybe I can't speak to properly, but he wasn't on the level of the place screaming, you know,  I want this, I want that.  He was...  He walked up.  Thank you for him.  Paul, you didn't even say thank you, man.  You didn't even shake the hand and say...  That's what I look for.  That's what I look for.  I look for him.  He didn't say thanks for everything. 
[03:41:00]  All right.  He didn't even thank you for the night?  No.  Paul's an ass.  I always knew it.  It's like 20 different times, I'm sure.  I kept saying it.  Are you happy with everything?  I'm happy with everything he's doing.  I thank you.  His girlfriend.  Big A gave me a hug, man.  Very warm.  Very nice.  Paul, while you're running around bossing everybody around, Big A is just looking for  a waitress to strangle.  I know.  Exactly.  All right.  We're actually missing one.  All right, Paul.  Oh, shit.  Hey, Paul.  Yeah. 
[03:41:30]  All right, Brett.  See you guys.  See you, Brett.  Take it easy, Brett.  See you later.  See you later.  Boy, mobile device coming in on instant feedback.  All the black jokes, no filter.  Paul tells, and he winds up tipping just like one.  My brother's the nicest guy.  I mean, it's ridiculous how generous the kid is.  He doesn't have any money because he's always handing it to somebody.  How convenient.  He doesn't remember the end of the night.  Yeah. 
[03:42:00]  Well, go to FH Riley's 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  It's a slow time of year, so my brother could definitely use a few din-dins.  Yeah, you hear how out of his way he went and how, like, even during that conversation,  very courteous.  Still nice.  And nice.  Still nice to the end.  Saying that all the fans are very nice.  And then Paul just, oh, what a, what an awful guest.  Makes good radio.  I reckon so. 
[03:42:30]  All right, Jim Gavigan in house, in studio.  We're going to talk about the great new wonderful after the break, okay?  We finally should get into that.  Get the word out for the new movie.  And we got Don and Mike audio.  We should stay a little late today, I'm thinking.  Why don't we go into break with the Don and Mike audio and comment when we come back on it?  It's like three tracks.  Oh, okay.  It's all over the place, so we're never going to get to it.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come.  Oh, we're in the empty.  Here we go.  Walka, walka. 
[03:43:00]  Talkin'.  He, he, he, he, he.  Hey.  What the fuck is that?  Hey.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  Oh, yeah.  What an ass.  Oh.  I, I, I can't believe. 
[03:43:30]  Are you insane?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God damn.  All right.  Say what again?  Come on, say what?  What?  Drop the fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Stop.  Oh.  Give it to me.  Fuck it.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  Give it to me.  Back, back, back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up. 
[03:44:00]  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  Back it up.  When we're really gonna need them  Throw out your tears and fly  Wanna go for a ride?  In studio, Jim Gaffigan.  Oh, he's charming.  Let's talk about this movie, The Great New Wonderful.  It is wonderful.  You started talking about it, and then we went on an hour tangent. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  It revolves around 9-11, right?  Well, not really.  It's totally indirectly related to people, New Yorkers after 9-11.  But it's a good movie.  It was like a hit at Tribeca, and it's got good people in it.  It's got Tony Shalhoub and Edie Falco and Olympia Dukakis, Maggie Gyllenhaal, blah, blah, blah.  Heard of these people.  What is your rage about?  What is your rage about? 
[03:45:00]  I think that everyone should see the movie and decide.  But explain the plot.  It's just people with rage.  No, it's kind of like...  What is the deal here?  It's about 2002.  Yes.  You know, five stories of New Yorkers, you know, and how we were kind of living our lives,  2002 in September.  I mean, you kind of remember...  I mean, in watching the movie, I always kind of remember, like, there was that whole year  where it was kind of like you were existing and kind of like this, is this place going  to explode in a moment? 
[03:45:30]  Kind of, you know, this freaky kind of like...  Yeah, waiting for the next show.  Kind of like when you come from a funeral, that kind of fatigue in your, you know, kind of  like your emotions and stuff like that.  But it's a funny movie, I mean, too, at times.  I mean, not that 9-11's funny at all, but it's about, you know, like awkwardness.  And it was directed by Danny Liner, who did Harold and Kumar and, you know...  That was a weird movie.  Harold and Kumar? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  I didn't see it.  I didn't see Dude, Where's My Car, either.  But it was like...  I almost liked that movie, Anthony.  What?  Harold and Kumar?  I almost liked it.  I found it entertaining, but it was very weird.  Really?  I mean...  Yeah, like strange.  Like, who thinks to make this a movie?  That's why I got to start smoking pot again, so I can enjoy...  Is that it?  Yeah, so I can enjoy some of these movies.  I think it's a big stoner flick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's a good movie.  I mean, you know, but what am I going to say?  It's bad?  I mean, it's...  Of course not. 
[03:46:30]  I think it's...  And it's cool as a comedian, and I'm sure Jim will...  It's fun to, you know, to get an opportunity to act and, you know, just, you know, kind  of stretch out and do different things.  Yeah.  As opposed to just being a comedian.  That's right.  Just being a comedian.  It is weird.  People will say to me, they'll go, hey, there's a lot of really good actors.  And that, uh, how'd you get in there?  Yeah, what are you doing in there?  And I'm like, well, I'm right here.  I know.  I mean...  I know that's very flattering of you to say, but thank you. 
[03:47:00]  I know.  It is really odd that, like, comics, for the most part, most of them, most, all of them,  are looking to get into acting, into a TV show or something, when what they do on stage  is pretty much just be themselves, for the most part, and talk about themselves.  They're the ones that want more than, like, any other group of whatever.  Like, Jim Carrey wants to try to be a little more serious.  Robin Williams, obviously, is a great example.  But even at the beginning, when maybe you're getting comedy roles, like, it's not just... 
[03:47:30]  You're not just a stand-up comic doing cities around the country.  It's like, you're always looking to get on a pilot or, you know, some kind of show.  It's always like this quest for this acting thing.  It's...  I don't know.  I mean, I think it's kind of like a creative thing.  You want to try different things, too.  You know what I mean?  What's wrong with juggling?  I never had acting aspirations.  Plates spinning.  It just happened.  You didn't?  No, I really didn't.  I don't.  I want to be good at it when I need to do it.  But, I mean, most sitcoms I've seen are dog shit. 
[03:48:00]  I mean, and, you know, some people would say about the same about Louis.  Whatever.  I don't want to do most projects.  I don't think they're good.  But I think the one thing I would add is that most comics have to do stand-up.  You know what I mean?  Like, they...  I mean, wouldn't you agree, Jim?  It's like...  Oh, yeah.  It's like...  There's some...  Because there's some people that are like,  Hey, I'm an actor.  I'll do stand-up for a year, and then I'll, you know, cancelate that into getting on, you know,  the funny house sitcom.  You can't really reverse engineer that whole actor-comedian thing. 
[03:48:30]  You can go comedian-actor, but actor-comedian, yeah, I don't think that works very well.  Yeah, it's Sally Field.  What movie was that?  Punchline.  Punchline.  But Tom Hanks has the breakdown on stage.  That's funny.  Wait till you see the acting that Adam Sandler does in this new movie, Click.  Is he good?  I want to.  That's just in entertainment, right?  It's just kind of like a silly movie, right?  No. 
[03:49:00]  See?  It's not?  I went, knowing that it was a silly Adam Sandler movie, and most of his movies are average  at best, and halfway through the movie, I'm like, this is almost...  It's not funny anymore.  I was going to say, the movie itself was, could have been funnier, I guess is what I'm  saying.  And then all of a sudden, it wasn't funny at all.  Oh, really?  Then it becomes beyond serious, and all of a sudden, you're in some kind of Stanley Kubrick  film for a while, and you're like, I look at my girl, and I go, is he trying to win 
[03:49:30]  an Oscar right here?  I mean, what is he doing?  And then, of course, it has the dramatic ending, but of course, Hollywood can't have  that type of ending.  Where he throws away the remote one.  He's like, you know what?  I don't want to control my destiny.  Is that the story?  That's the final scene, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Because you know...  That's the final scene.  After he goes Stanley Kubrick on us for a while, and has this dramatic death scene,  I don't give a fuck if I ruin this movie.  It sucked.  We almost walked out 40 minutes in.  And then he gets all dramatic, and he dies, and right there, the movie should end it, 
[03:50:00]  but Hollywood can't handle that type of thing, so it has to end with some kind of fun and  happiness, and some goofy song playing in the background.  You can do it!  But it's that whole...  Does he become friends with the young boy that he helps through the journey?  That's always another one, too.  I totally thought that was a comedy.  That was actually a joke, I think.  Brian McFadden, when I first started stand-up, he used to have that joke about having a remote 
[03:50:30]  control.  Oh, yeah.  You just fast forward when your girlfriend's talking.  Yeah.  And then...  Brian McFadden would do that.  He did that 20 years ago.  You're right.  And I remember seeing the movie.  20 years?  Was it though, like...  Like with a big old remote?  You know?  Wow, yeah.  McFadden did do that shit.  But when I saw a commercial for it, I was like, wow.  I thought it was a total formula comedy movie.  It's like, what if you hit fast forward and then pause?  What if the pause button gets stuck? 
[03:51:00]  That's what I totally thought that movie was about.  No, apparently...  And then Rob Schneider's in the movie.  That guy has possessed.  Rob has to be in every Adam Sandler movie.  I get it.  I get it.  You're friends.  You're helping him out because he really can't do it on his own.  I don't know.  Why can I have a friend that does movies?  Okay.  Yeah.  I guess you have a point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Tim in North Carolina.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, good morning, buh-buh boys.  How's it going?  Hey, Tim. 
[03:51:30]  Hey, Tim.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, Mr. Gaffigan there.  Yes, sir.  You have some acting chops.  I just saw you on a rerun of Law & Order the other day where you were the creepy mortician  who wasn't burning the bodies.  There you go.  Thank you.  Oh.  Taken from the headlines.  A story ripped from the headlines.  Dun, dun.  No, Law & Order.  Have you done a Law & Order?  Dong.  I've done anything, just think of any show, and the answer's no.  Oh.  Hey, have you?  No.  No, Law & Order.  I was a pedophile clown on Law & Order, too.  Were you?  My friend Adam played a pedophile, not a clown, but a pedophile murderer. 
[03:52:00]  Well, you know those things.  I behave like one.  Law & Order at SVU, you're always a pedophile.  Yeah.  And I think they love it when they're like, it's a comedian who's playing a pedophile.  A clown is a pedophile.  Those Law & Orders.  Those are fun to do, though.  Are they?  Is it quick?  What are you doing?  Dang?  No, it takes like 20 minutes.  That's it?  It takes longer to audition for it than it does to shoot the thing. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  They're just like on the go and everything, but that's a sweet gig.  And then TNT runs it to death, so you know.  So a check comes in the mail every so often?  Yeah, but it's like a cable check, so it's like a nickel.  It's like that guy's tip at your brother's bar.  Thank you for your part.  I have a question for Gaffigan.  What's got better health insurance, SAG or AFTRA?  SAG.  Okay.  I have both.  Should I deal with SAG?  SAG.  I think SAG.  Okay.  AFTRA blows.  AFTRA, you know, you get the information in the mail from AFTRA, and it's like, it might 
[03:53:00]  as well be in like Koran, you know?  It's like, you are a part of AFTRA.  I heard the Writers Guild, that's what you're supposed to get.  And the voting, they send some big ballad for the voting, and you don't even know what  or, because it's not even like people you're voting for, it's things.  Yeah.  And I look through this thing, and I throw it right away.  Boof.  See ya.  Throw away.  Let's go to AFTRA.  AFTRA's worthless.  Let's go to Cody.  Cody in Indiana.  They did nothing for us when we got fired.  They're worthless.  And now we're back with them. 
[03:53:30]  For what reason?  I don't know.  Why are you with them?  Why do you have to be with them?  You have to be.  You have to be ready to work.  Yeah, yeah.  Certain places.  Cody in Indiana.  Fucking thieves.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Mr. Gaffigan.  I'm from Valparaiso.  Oh, there you go.  How you doing today?  Good, good.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for your countless hours of laughter.  No, thanks.  I will enjoy a nice Shoops burger for you.  Oh, Shoops is the shit.  See ya.  Punch it out.  Bye-bye.  All right.  He loves you. 
[03:54:00]  It is really good.  Hey, we got to play this dynamite audio, or they're going to kill us, because we started  up on JFK.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, our show's being played right now, matter of fact.  Yes, we're competing.  We're competing against ourselves.  What is something, Mike?  They're showing DC.  They're on afternoons.  We used to have major problems.  We have a backstory with that whole thing.  I love this aspect of the show.  Oh, radio is just...  Yeah, no, because one time I came in, and there was some radio station in Florida that  were like...  They were like, and then that Opie guy with his roller skating.  It was just like...  It's always entertaining. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, there's always a problem.  There's always some war, a battle going on.  Well, they're trying to create conflict, probably because they'll get the publicity, because  you guys will play them and make fun of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had a huge blowout with Don and Mike.  I mean, it was one of the biggest.  When we were at WNEW in New York, they came to WNEW.  Everything started out fine and dandy.  And I swear to you, I can't even remember what happened. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, I was going to say the same thing.  Or what went wrong.  Is it like a status thing?  Like, you were higher status than them, and then they came in, but they had some status  in D.C.  Well, they had very big status in D.C.  Yeah.  Like, they have huge numbers in D.C.  Yeah.  We came down to D.C., and we had just started there, and we didn't have good numbers.  Right, right.  But it was even before that, because we wouldn't have just started bashing each other for ratings.  Right.  Like, I can't remember why it started. 
[03:55:30]  Like, we were both at the same station.  I think everybody at NEW was pretty miserable with the way things were run, and we were just  all pissed off at the world back then.  Right, right.  So, like, and it wasn't every show, because Ron and Fez was there, and we got along with  them.  It was just, there was this, just, like, funk between shows, certain shows.  Same thing with, like, Tom Likas.  He turned out to be a fucking asshole.  He really is an asshole.  And that, we had problems with him.  At least he talks in his real voice, though. 
[03:56:00]  Hey, Tom Likas.  Oh, two o'clock here, and there's going to be a woman who, uh, shut up, fatso.  I hate him.  In some of these conflicts, is it sometimes where you, uh, they're nice to you, and then  you listen to their show, and you're like, I can't deal with it.  Uh, yeah, there's a time.  And I'm sure, like, you guys, you know, a lot of people are going after you because of  your success.  Yeah, yeah, that's happened, too, where people, that used to be friends, they turn on you.  Like, radio is like wrestling.  It's like professional fucking wrestling.  You go in the ring, you're together, you're ready. 
[03:56:30]  You, you know, kick this tag team's ass, and then you turn around, and your partner  hits you in the face with a folding chair, and you go, what?  And the crowd goes, what happened there?  But they were friends, and now they're enemies.  Yeah.  It's so ridiculous.  It's weird when you go to cities, and, like, uh, you can't even do the same radio station  on the same day.  You're like, I'm just trying to get people to go and see me to do stand-up.  Yeah.  It's just a loyalty oath you have to take. 
[03:57:00]  They're like, can you not be funny on two shows in the same day?  And you're like, argh, argh.  I know.  It's ridiculous.  That, we never hold against anybody.  And that's something we never have.  Like, if anybody, Colin Quinn does Stern's show.  Every so often, Howard will invite him on to sit in on the news or something like that.  And normally, you know, that would infuriate Stern if somebody, like one of his guys, because  we consider Colin one of our guys, he's on our show a lot, and he would ban him from 
[03:57:30]  the show.  Like, we always found that ridiculous, and it's really silly and stupid.  Good, because I've been meaning to talk to you about something.  Jimmy, you go anywhere you want.  If you think you could have fun on someone else's program.  I want to be on the Tom Lankus show.  You want to be on Lankus show?  You want to be on Lankus show?  You want to be on Lankus?  You tell the Lankus.  Now, is Tom Lankus, what was the falling out there?  You said that you just did that.  Tom, that was an authentic falling out.  He came in to New York like he was the champion of the world.  He was the shit. 
[03:58:00]  And started really talking down to us.  What do you mean talking down to you?  On the air?  Yeah, on the air.  Talking down to us, saying that.  And we're hacks, and nobodies.  And we were sitting in our office one day.  It's like Sopranos when I hear these stories.  And I'm like, the guy, he's from the L.A., you know, he came in here, he didn't show respect.  He didn't show proper respect.  You know, he's coming to New York to, you know, fix the station, because it was a mess.  But we were doing very well, and the rest of the station was really, you know, struggling 
[03:58:30]  in the ratings.  And he legitimately stinks.  I've listened to him in L.A.  I couldn't get enough of his fucking phony voice.  You fucking phony bag of shit.  Now, how do you, I guess, all right.  But how do you guys reconcile some of these conflicts, or don't you?  You just let them go on.  You just let them sit out there.  You just let them go on.  Sometimes they just fizzle out.  Sometimes you actually have a conversation with people.  Sometimes so much time goes by.  Do they call you up and they say, truce? 
[03:59:00]  Nah, there's never a phone call.  Oh, there's sometimes, we've had people call up, yeah, somebody's, some people's people  call up and say, could you, like, knock it off?  I'd probably go and talk.  Tell these people to knock it off, because our fans are vicious and brutal and don't stop.  Oh, really?  They love to, like, fuck with other shows really badly.  Right, right, right.  And they know all the tricks.  They know, like, how to get through screeners.  So their whole show is taken up with our stupid callers, just, like, goofing on them with 
[03:59:30]  inside Opie and Anthony jokes.  It's really funny.  It makes, like, ten other people laugh.  And it's vicious.  Sometimes they're just vicious about it.  But, so, yeah, we've had people to call things off.  But for the most part, they just, enough time goes by, they fizzle out.  Remember Cool Guy?  Yeah.  We followed a guy named Cool Guy who does a music thing on Boneyard.  Why wouldn't you?  On Boneyard?  Yeah, on the XM channel.  And then the fight just kind of fizzled out. 
[04:00:00]  And I tuned him in a few times just to really hate him.  And I fucking loved the show.  It really annoyed me how much I loved every song he played.  I was like, goddammit, this cocksucker plays everything I like.  So after a while, like, I couldn't be mad at him anymore.  So now I just fucking dig his show.  You know, I really like the show a lot.  Yeah.  Well, let's play with Don and Mike all the time.  Yeah, man, you're like, eh, it was bullshit.  So we had a big problem with Don and Mike.  And they were talking nicely about us on their show recently.  Yeah.  And how many years have gone by?  Four years.  Four years.  Over, I think, four years. 
[04:00:30]  Four years.  I mean, when he can't even remember what shit was about, perhaps it's time to just, you  know, patch things up.  Here we go.  Bailey, we want to ask all of you out there to great unwashed.  Come on out.  Our next number 15 party.  And we will have a limited amount between 200 and 500 of the We Are Number 15 Listen  Harder buttons.  And we will also have something we will not be discussing on the radio, a special commemorative  button that you can only get Wednesday night out of Hankston. 
[04:01:00]  Can you pause this for one second?  It will be irrelevant after that.  Did we get this audio?  Were they broadcasting from a sub?  How did we not get good audio?  JFK is a major station.  Why would we?  Where did we get this?  Who got the audio?  Maybe there's just a bit with it.  Was it Steve?  Isn't that awful audio?  It's terrible.  I mean, but they're on like JFK.  They're not on like a small station.  It's like real audio.  It sounds like the transmissions going from the base to the Rebel fleet and getting to  the Death Star.  It's like communication on the show. 
[04:01:30]  Like MASH.  It's like, all right.  Is there a chopper coming in or not?  Horrible.  I don't know if we're going to be able to sit through that.  We've got to get radar on that.  Yeah, it's all like underwater-y.  It will be.  It shall be.  And we can't talk about it on the radio.  So come on out to Mike's Place of Merit.  That's next Wednesday night for our We Are Number 15 party.  And to quote Opie Anthony, it's a hang.  It's a hang.  Yeah.  It's a hang.  That's all it is.  You like that, Joe?  No.  No.  No.  He doesn't like it. 
[04:02:00]  You don't listen to them, Don.  Come on.  Hey, what was that?  That was the audio just shutting itself off because of the quality of it.  How did we not get this?  Where did we get that from?  Was that the streaming?  It was sent it in off the streaming feed.  Oh, this is it.  All right.  Well, let's try.  Streaming into a toilet.  Yeah.  What kind of awful radio was it?  Transistor radio?  Hey, shit, Dick, get a better radio and record for us for free.  Here's Don and Mike talking about us coming to JFK.  We started up today.  And talking about radio wars, Jim. 
[04:02:30]  Well, I was going to say something that I just thought I should say because I'm pretty  sure that before you know it, Opie and Anthony are going to be heard on, if not this station,  many stations that we are heard on.  I think I said, you know, the other thing is a hang, just like them.  And a lot of people behind the scenes have been asking, what do you think about it?  Now, Mike and I discussed this pretty much ad nauseum, both when they got fired from CBS  and then when they got hired back.  Well, here's my take on it.  More power to them. 
[04:03:00]  You know, I'm at a different place than I was four years ago when we fought with them.  You know, I would say that they gave us the best fight we ever had, and I would hope that  they would save us the same in return.  And really, I mean, like I said, since Frida died, it's like radio wars and stuff to me  seems stupid unless there's some genuine hatred there.  And at one point, four or five years ago, there was.  But then, you know, then Frida passed away, and then I got like an MP3 of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:03:30]  I think I mentioned this when I came back.  You most certainly loved them the day that they were on their show.  And more specifically, their funny guy, Jimmy Norton, who really was very eloquent about it  and seemed to draw the line between, you know, there's a radio war and then there's real life.  So, yeah, oops, I've let another cat out of the bag.  I haven't died.  You know.  I've let another cat out of the bag that Opie and Anthony will be on the station soon.  Oops.  Cool.  Yeah.  That's pretty much the deal. 
[04:04:00]  It was a big radio war.  His wife died tragically.  Yeah.  His wife died a year ago.  And a lot of people were asking us to, like, go after him.  Like, oh, yeah, and making jokes about it.  And it's like, dude, you've got to understand where the radio shit ends and real life begins.  There is a crossover point.  But, you know, with something like that, it's so horribly tragic.  Yeah.  That you could not possibly, like, try to drag a radio war over to how serious something like that is. 
[04:04:30]  So, it ended the whole thing right there.  Yeah, that was the day I said, you know, why?  How the fuck are you going to...  Enough.  Yeah.  I mean, how are you going to drag something as stupid as a radio war into something as serious as that?  But it made me reflect on some of the good times we did have walking into Don and Mike's office at N.E.W., opening up the window and throwing all this stuff out.  It was so many really, really funny things that had happened.  Oh, my God.  But it was a great war. 
[04:05:00]  It was a really good radio war.  I mean, it was vicious.  We got one more clip.  Yes, Jim?  Well, I'm sure you guys already talked about this, but I remember reading, like, a couple weeks ago, wasn't there some DJ that threatened some other DJ's daughter?  Oh, my God.  That was a bad one.  Yeah.  Star from the Star and Buckwild show had a problem.  But they're all, like, from urban stations and stuff, so they're all black guys and just, you know, full of just ready-to-shoot people.  I don't understand it.  But for some reason, it gets really serious really quickly. 
[04:05:30]  Like, we could be in a four-year radio war and never even see the person.  Yeah, yeah.  Urban stations, if you're in a radio war for three minutes, when you walk out the front door to go to your car that night, you'll get shot or your car will explode.  It just...  It is amazing.  This station that you're talking about, the guy that worked there, had how many shootings?  Three?  I don't even know.  I think three or four shootings outside by various rap bands.  Star, or was that outside of 97?  Oh, 97.  Just the station alone. 
[04:06:00]  Well, DJ Envy didn't get fired.  It was Star from 105.1.  Yeah.  Who was just talking about, like, his kid.  They threatened to find his kid or something.  It was said in humor, to be fair.  But, I mean, it was a dumb thing to say.  That sounded like some serious shit when he was saying it.  I don't think he really wanted the kid.  He said, you know, he was soliciting the listeners to send the school that the child went to to him and threatened, like, sexual assault on the child.  Yearning on the kid.  Yeah.  It was really, really crossing the line, you know, as far as not, you know, FCC thing. 
[04:06:30]  Or even if something like that is done in a dark, humorous way.  I think that's actually criminal, isn't it?  Yeah, they said actually, yeah, it was.  If you do something like that in some dark, comedic fashion where there's some kind of background to set up a context, that's one thing.  Then, fine.  Let it fly.  I happen to think anything in the right context can be funny.  But something like that and the way he was presenting it was a little too rough.  All right.  Let's play the last clip here. 
[04:07:00]  They talk about our firing.  The fact is, you can't ignore, you know, the fact that they have done what they've done.  And these guys, I think, were victims of what anybody that does what we do could have had.  That could have happened to anybody with that whole thing because what they do, and let me just pull back the curtain a little bit here.  This company will come to you and they will say, hey, be as edgy as you can.  Push that envelope.  Do what you can.  Do what you can.  And then when it hits the fan, you saw what happened to those guys. 
[04:07:30]  And out of that, they, you know, they did resurrect their situation.  They even went down.  People only got canned when we were, you know.  I remember what you said in our band.  It's the management.  I mean, you said specifically, and I remember this, when that happened with all the fighting we did.  And believe me, it did get personal.  And it did get tense.  And it wasn't fun.  And we were really legitimately pissed on a number of occasions.  But what you said was, you didn't think they should have been fired for what they did.  And I remember that.  And that was right at the very, because the management marvel of the fact that we were still feuding with those. 
[04:08:00]  The management knew that they were doing that contest, to have sex in a public place.  Management knew.  You know, that's exactly what Mike's talking about.  It's not like they were doing it.  The management should have been canned.  Yeah, it's not.  Well, and they were.  You know, remember that's why they said four heads in a duffel bag.  Anyway, I don't know why I mentioned that.  I just mentioned it.  All right, that was the line.  I got to tell you, as far as that goes, if they wanted to know now if that infuriated me.  Wait, what was the line again?  Four heads in a duffel bag.  Right. 
[04:08:30]  When we got fired, they were still on the air.  And I heard a tape of what they were saying about the whole thing, because we were kind  of getting everybody's opinion on the whole thing, different DJs and stuff.  And I remember hearing Don laughing his ass off that we were fired.  And I'm sitting there fired, feeling like shit.  And Don just goes, there they are.  Oh, we couldn't ask for better.  He goes, you know, we thought maybe one would go or two over the years or something like  that.  But there it is, delivered.  Four heads in a duffel bag. 
[04:09:00]  And I'm sitting there like, oh, you motherfucker.  I was so pissed off.  It's a funny line, too.  It really is.  I know.  And it was.  Four heads.  We can laugh now.  One sucking on three cocks.  But it was four heads.  Four heads and one holding onto coattails.  I wasn't even in the duffel bag.  I was just hanging on the outside.  Come on, guys.  I really am a worm.  Make myself nauseous.  Oh, it was horrible.  But boy, did that get to me.  I was livid.  Four heads in a duffel bag.  Anyway, I don't know why I mentioned that. 
[04:09:30]  I just mentioned it because, well, hey, we're the eagles.  We're the eagles.  And, you know, I don't consider opening Anthony but he flies.  There are other flies out there.  Other flies that are more worthy of us stomping on and eating.  You know, so anyway, that's all.  They're coming to work here.  And if they want to fight, that's okay.  We don't want them.  You know, what's the point?  Right.  You know what I mean?  It was fun, like, when it was happening.  But it's now then, you know, they've done what they've done.  I mean, you know, our choices to fight are, well, really, you know, Howard. 
[04:10:00]  And even though Howard doesn't work here anymore, you know, gosh, who knows how things might end up.  You know, the people that you hate one day end up being your employer the next day.  Yeah, it's weird.  Your enemies become your friends.  Your friends become your enemies in this business.  So, there you go.  Thank Donna Mike today if you guys are in Washington.  Give him a quick call and say thanks.  For real, like, not a bullshit one.  That was actually cool of him to do.  Yeah, we finally got to listen to the audio. 
[04:10:30]  Is that pretty rare for someone to do something like that?  Yeah, on air, yes.  A lot of times.  Definitely on air.  It's very rare, yeah.  To actually break character and go, all right, look, man, we're done with the fight.  Yeah, you don't hear that that much.  It is odd that it got so bad and so personal.  And so, like, there was this hatred and you don't even really know where it came from.  It's amazing.  Like, I can't remember exactly what it's built up from.  If anyone says anything bad against you guys, a listener will get you that information. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because they love being a little instigator.  It's kind of like in a comedy club.  If you do a joke and you're talking to somebody, the audience, even if it's not insulting, they'll  go, ooh.  Yeah, yeah.  Ooh.  You guys going to fight?  Ooh.  Well, so-and-so says you're doing his bit.  You know, like that.  Like, the comedians are like weasels just trying to start problems.  All right.  We got to get out of here.  I don't want to get out of here.  I'm tired.  Jim, where can people see your flick?  Well, I have the information in front of me. 
[04:11:30]  It's in New York, D.C., and Boston right now.  New kind.  It's the great new wonderful.  Great new wonderful.  And you're playing Vergara?  Tell me something about your guy.  Who are you in the movie?  I know you don't want to give away why you're raised.  I play this guy who's forced by his employee to go through a therapy session with Tony Shalhoub.  But it's all about people dealing with their emotions after 9-11.  It's kind of hard to describe.  It's impossible to describe.  Just see it for God's sake. 
[04:12:00]  You have to do it all in theaters, too.  It's really bugging me.  He does it.  You're doing the Borgata?  You're doing huge theaters.  But I don't want to.  I did the Borgata.  You and Natal.  What did you guys do?  Like, the amphitheater?  The event center.  It's called the event center.  I don't want to.  The event center.  It wasn't an event.  I always love when comics are like, I'm so jealous of you doing commercials.  I'm like, you're on a TV show on HBO.  No, I don't.  Yeah, but I don't like it.  I never look at what they have and appreciate it.  I've only been on that for recently.  You're doing a theater.  You're touring with Opie and it's like...  All right, let's get out here. 
[04:12:30]  What do you get to Borgata?  July 15th.  Jim Gaffigan.  His stand-up rocks.  Yes.  And he sells out.  I love seeing Jim Gaffigan.  JimGaffigan.com.  G-A-F-F-I-G-A-N.  For any dumbbell that would try it with one F.  I would have.  Oh, you wouldn't have, sweetie.  Don't sell yourself short.  You'd have put three.  When has you guys got a bunch of that tour coming up?  Oh, yeah.  Shit, yeah.  We got one.  We don't need to sell the show.  Ticketmaster. 
[04:13:00]  Plenty of tickets.  Ticketmaster, yeah.  No, through Ticketmaster for our tour.  Hey, Jim, thank you.  It's always a pleasure.  Thanks for having me.  You're welcome, man.  Def Leppard tomorrow on the show.  All of them?  I think so, yeah.  I heard it was only two of them.  Which two?  Joe Elliott, not Rick Allen.  Not the door.  Whatever.  Cool.  I would have to get all of them.  It's still pretty cool.  Joe Elliott's pretty cool.  I love Joe Elliott.  He's actually really funny.  He did great in the Aussie documentary.  I can't wait to mention that to him.  I'm sure you will.  He was great.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  Bye, Jim.  All right, man.  Thank you. 
[04:13:30]  See you tomorrow.  Bye.  I just love listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sometimes I laugh so hard, I forget about all the times my Uncle Henry rubbed my special  place.  Opie and Anthony! </pre>
