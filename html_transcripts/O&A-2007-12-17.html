<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts defiantly asserting their right to be offensive.  They then launched into a discussion of the NFL, mocking the poor performances of the Cowboys, Dolphins, and Jets, while celebrating the Patriots' undefeated streak.  Their frustration with a local news station prematurely cutting away from a live game was also aired.  Anthony then recounted his upcoming Christmas trip to Colorado, focusing on his successful negotiation to stay in a hotel to avoid his girlfriend's three young children who kept entering his room at night and his very talkative mother-in-law.  He also described a difficult flight over the Rocky Mountains.

The conversation turned to the death of Dan Fogelberg, prompting a lengthy, offensive, and humorous critique of his song "Leader of the Band,"  with crude jokes about Fogelberg's father, his possible military service, and his death from prostate cancer.  Anthony's *I Am Legend*-esque car and the upcoming *Knight Rider* movie were briefly mentioned. A caller brought up "Christmas Shoes," leading to a darkly comedic dissection of the song's lyrics.  The segment concluded with discussions of Jim Norton's stand-up performances, Andy Pettitte's admission of HGH use, and a mocking of a news clip about Roger Clemens' return to the Yankees.

The next segment opened with the hosts mocking sports commentator Susan Waltman. They then discussed the surprising box office success of *Alvin and the Chipmunks* compared to *I Am Legend*.  The bulk of this segment focused on Maxim magazine's "Top 10 Best and Worst Things to Happen to Men in 2007" lists, with the hosts expressing considerable skepticism and derision towards many of the choices. The "best" list included the writer's strike, the McRib's return, Daniel Tosh's rise, increased sex among female gamers, A-Rod's re-signing, a Van Halen reunion, a supposed breast-staring longevity study, and Hayden Panettiere turning 18. The "worst" list included the ending of *The Sopranos*, smaller Jimmy Dean sausages, Evel Knievel's death, Bear Grylls' exposure as a faker, Crocs, Oscar De La Hoya in women's underwear, Boston sports dominance, David Beckham in America, and "Two Girls, One Cup," with the number one worst being men who dance.  The hosts played and ridiculed a Tom Tancredo political ad and discussed a newspaper article on sexless marriages, offering sarcastic commentary on the listed reasons. A caller, Ian, unsuccessfully challenged the hosts to name all 50 states. The segment ended with discussions of John C. Reilly's upcoming appearance to discuss *Walk Hard*, gratuitous nudity in movies, and *Knocked Up*, along with further crude commentary on reasons for sexless marriages.

Opie began the next segment by recounting a failed romantic dinner, criticizing clich√© romantic settings. The conversation shifted to their upcoming interview with John C. Reilly, promoting "Walk Hard," and included a brief chastisement of a co-worker for missing a screening.  John C. Reilly then joined the show, discussing his musical background, roles in "Walk Hard" and "Boogie Nights" (including anecdotes about filming and a surprisingly funny nude scene in "Walk Hard"), the "Walk Hard" soundtrack, collaborations with other musicians, theater experiences (including "True West" with Philip Seymour Hoffman), career progression, current fame, and a funny anecdote about witnessing a pornographic film shoot.  The hosts promoted Reilly's concert. After Reilly left, the hosts discussed Christmas gifts, Opie's Colorado trip, the impracticality of renting a Porsche in snow, reminisced about Reilly's appearance, and Opie expressed his dislike for Tim Meadows.  Caller interactions followed, discussing "Walk Hard," cars, Colorado weather, the absurdity of Christmas gift-giving, and Opie's continued dislike for Tim Meadows. The segment concluded with mentions of SalsaSnack.com, compared to "Two Girls, One Cup," and Big Kev's Christmas party, featuring "The Spirit of Taking."

The next segment focused on Big Kev's Christmas party, Jim Norton's exclusion, and Jim Norton's therapy.  The discussion delved into Jim's struggles with emotional expression, self-loathing, and anger, detailing incidents involving a cab and a physical altercation. Anthony's emotional state was addressed, with Jim urging him to cry. Anthony attempted to sing a song.  The conversation included humorous and self-deprecating discussions about Anthony's sweatpants and "ass leakage," listener calls, and continued discussion of Anthony's emotional repression and the benefits of therapy.

The final segment featured graphic and humorous accounts of bodily functions, specifically anal leakage and related embarrassments.  Listener calls shared similar experiences, with the conversation filled with crude jokes.  Jimmy's therapy and emotional state were again discussed, using metaphors about expelling "big, heavy shit," along with recurring jokes about his unwashed sweatpants and long johns, which he promised to bring to the studio for the hosts and Jared (a returning intern) to smell.  Jared was interviewed, with the conversation frequently veering into irreverent tangents.  Listener calls detailing bodily fluid experiences and embarrassing situations were included, along with a discussion of a window washer's miraculous survival. The segment concluded with a song choice ("It Was a Very Good Year") evoking emotional responses from Opie and a final mention of "goofy gags" involving uncircumcised penises.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  A shocking thing that border on offensive in order to entertain their offense.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw! 
[00:00:30]  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Intimus DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony striking again.  I sat with some of the greatest dancers in the world.  John Gotti, Jim Babbana.  And I went out that said, John, you ever f***ed with me again.  This is over.  Here we go, son.  Opie and Anthony.  I was amazed Guns N' Roses was starting to blow up and you didn't have guitars to play 
[00:01:00]  because you were pointing them off to get some dope.  Yeah, I was a big fan of the age.  Big fan.  Opie and Anthony.  This country went off the cliff and it's just in free fall.  It's just a sick, sick, it's disgusting my voice you hear.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, Jimmy, your Cowboys win. 
[00:01:30]  I didn't watch the rest of the game.  They lost 10-6.  It was 10-6?  A terrible offensive game.  What the hell happened to me?  Where the hell did I go?  Oh, I think I decided to go to the gym or something.  That was such a great game and then I just blew off the second half.  I don't know why.  Interception and then stupid.  But they had like third long and stupid Donovan McNabb competing like a 27-yard pass. 
[00:02:00]  Oops.  I'm sitting here and I realize I never watched the end of the Eagles-Cowboys game.  And I was into it.  I can't feel bad about that, though.  I mean, 12-2.  10-6.  10-6.  Stupid Dolphins win.  Yeah.  Yeah, that sucked.  Here in New York, there's a little controversy because a minute left in the game or a minute before they finally scored on that 64-yard scoring drive, whatever. 
[00:02:30]  Locally, they decided to just blow off the rest of the game.  Because I guess the Jets game ended early.  So then they went to the Dolphins game because there's interest in seeing if they're going to, you know, be 0-16 for the year.  Yeah.  And then the game's in overtime.  It's heating up.  It's really exciting.  And then they just, I don't know.  They went to a juice maker commercial or something.  They go to like highlights.  Yeah.  Of other games.  Why would you cut the game off?  There's no reason for that.  Like, who makes that decision and why do they still have a job? 
[00:03:00]  Nah, it's the NFL.  They have all sorts of rules when it comes to that crap.  Stupid.  Stupid.  That's stupid.  And the Pats, man.  Come on.  Undefeated.  So many people were thinking, I wanted the Jets to beat the Pats.  I don't like the Jets this year.  I didn't see that happening.  I haven't liked the Jets since week two, week three of the season.  I want the Pats to go undefeated.  What do they got left?  I know they got big blue. 
[00:03:30]  They got big blue left.  Big blue and they got the Dolphins, right?  The Dolphins.  Now that would be an ironic little twist of fate if the Dolphins beat them.  Beat them, Patriots?  Yeah.  That would be hysterically funny.  Why don't you keep on dreaming?  Good morning.  It's the opening of the show.  The Jets did hold Brady.  He wasn't able to make a touchdown pass.  Excuse me.  Are you crazy?  That's a little telling right there that maybe the momentum is slowing down. 
[00:04:00]  They had a blizzard overnight.  They couldn't even hold the football.  And do they have to invite the fans to clean out the stadium?  Every once in a while they have fans cleaning out stadiums around the league.  Yeah, they give them little shovels and let them in there early.  And give them a gift certificate to Subway or something.  And make them work.  And they feel that that's something fun and good to do.  Like you're helping out the team, man.  Screw you.  Yeah.  Yeah, we won.  We won.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Why?  Because you cleaned off a seat.  Now you're part of the team.  So that's why you didn't throw any freaking passes or anything, man.  That was a boring game.  The game of the week, though, is the Browns and the Bills.  Did anyone see that?  No.  Did it bring you back to being like 12, 13 years old playing football in the snow with  your friends?  You didn't see it?  They couldn't even figure out where the 50-yard line was at one point.  Snowy game.  Did they have to bring the old snowblower out to go and mark the lines? 
[00:05:00]  Well, what it was, though, is that icy, crappy snow that Western New York gets and Cleveland  gets.  And so they couldn't really brush it off the field.  So they pretty much played the whole game and it was just white.  Usually when they play these snow games, they're able to get a lot of the field brushed off  so you kind of see the field underneath.  Not yesterday, man.  The Cleveland Browns and the Bills game.  Browns knocking out the Bills last night or yesterday afternoon.  Where was it?  Cleveland or Buffalo?  Cleveland, right? 
[00:05:30]  I believe.  Yes.  Look at us with our sort of knowledge.  Well, that's the beauty of us.  We give you just enough.  If you need more, go find ESPN Radio.  What can I tell you?  Browns beat the Bills 8-zip.  What a dumb score.  8-0.  Well, that is a silly score.  Ain't nothing.  The four safeties?  Stupid.  Well, there was a safety and then two field goals, right?  Was that it?  Atrocious. 
[00:06:00]  They didn't score.  Or did they score and miss the extra point?  I don't know.  I didn't watch the game.  I was watching the Jets and the Pats.  And the Jets had their third-string quarterback in for a while.  I didn't even know we had a third-string quarterback on the Jets.  Why bother?  Just an awful game.  That game was boring, too.  Yeah.  And then the game to watch was the one I walked out of the house to go to the gym or something.  Oops.  I don't know what I did, Jimmy, but I really wanted to see the rest of that game.  I didn't.  I hadn't.  Phone number is 877-212-O-N-A. 
[00:06:30]  Anthony was letting us in on his Christmas plans just before he went on the air.  Yes.  And I told Anthony he has to write a book because there's a lot of people, obviously, in relationships out there.  They're married, obviously.  And, you know, holidays, you have to kind of decide whose house you're going to go to.  Yeah, what you're going to do.  Like, in my case, I'm going to hang with the Philly crew this Christmas.  Yeah.  And, you know, my girl, she hung out with my family for Thanksgiving. 
[00:07:00]  You know the deal.  This is what you have to decide every year if you're in a relationship.  Well, Anthony, we found out about a week ago, is flying out to Colorado.  Yeah, I'm going out to Colorado to go out with ‚Äì I'm going out there with my girlfriend to see her sister and her husband.  Buddy played on one of our softball games.  Great guy.  Have a blast with him.  I love her sister Jen.  Great girl. 
[00:07:30]  Sister Jen?  Yeah, yeah, I know.  I've got over the name.  Yeah, I've gotten over the name, don't believe me.  Do you have a little, like, nickname for her just so you don't have to call her by her name?  Hey, you know, that's odd.  I really don't remember saying the name that much, so I guess I ‚Äì  I imagine you wouldn't, man.  Just go like, hey.  But the truth of the matter is, and it's no reflection on them, but I don't ‚Äì I'm not a big kid person. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  Now, they have beautiful children.  How many?  Three boys.  What ages?  They're, like, I guess ‚Äì let me do the math right.  Let me move down.  It's sort of a ‚Äì and don't crucify me if I get this wrong, okay?  Oh, who's going to crucify you?  I don't know.  Them.  I would guess something around 2, 4, and 6. 
[00:08:30]  They're probably ‚Äì  Somewhere around there.  They're probably 12, 14, and 16.  7, 8, 6, and 4.  Look, they're little kids.  All right, they're in that age.  They're all under 10.  Yeah.  Okay.  All under 10.  And I'm not a good guest at people's house guy.  Not because I'm bad or the house ‚Äì people at the house are bad or anything. 
[00:09:00]  It's just I'm not that guy.  I can't stay at other people's houses.  Well, this is why ‚Äì  I'm a hotel guy.  Well, let me set this up.  This is why you have to write a book and explain how you're able to get this done for other people out there.  Yeah, yeah.  Go ahead.  Well, when I found out we were going to Colorado, I'm happy to see everybody, but I don't like going out there because, first of all, it's Grand Junction, Colorado.  It is a pain in the ass to get to. 
[00:09:30]  You've got to fly either Denver or Salt Lake and then take a little turboprop jet over the Rocky Mountains.  This was the flight where I took the last time I went that I thought we were dead.  I swear to you, it's not even like one of those, wow, that was some heavy turbulence.  I really thought we were dead.  I had a Pez dispenser with Xanax in it, and I was just like, whap, whap, popping them. 
[00:10:00]  It was horrible.  What was the problem?  Dude, the plane was flying sideways, and I crap you not.  It was at a point where I was looking out where the pilot should have been looking.  My side window was now the front windshield of the plane.  It was twisting around sideways and dropping up and down and rolling.  On every axis, there was such updrafts coming from the Rockies on this little piece of crap plane that it was just bouncing like you couldn't believe. 
[00:10:30]  They apologized after the flight.  Thank you.  Did they at least come on and explain some stuff to you?  Nothing.  Those pilots were white-knuckled.  I know they were.  You think they were scared?  They were working.  Yeah, but they fly that route all the time.  They know the updrafts.  But they were working.  You ever drive home, and it's an ice storm, and it's windy, and you've got to really kind of concentrate.  It's not just that one-handed drive home.  You're used to the roads. 
[00:11:00]  You've done it a thousand times.  But you're like, you've got to watch out for other cars.  All right, I'm coming up to a curve.  This is really slippery.  No brakes.  No brakes.  Don't accelerate around this.  You're thinking.  You're not trying to find a song on the radio?  No, exactly.  The pilots weren't.  They were working.  They were working.  Or watch a movie on your...  Completely sideways.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All I can think of is that plane tilt and scoot.  It was sliding.  You get this slip sideways, and I was like, whoa, we're going sideways. 
[00:11:30]  That is just amazing.  Because the headwind coming from the other direction, the pilot has to turn into it, and then you're just going sideways.  Nice.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  So that I have to deal with, which I really didn't want to deal with.  I wanted to fly into Salt Lake City and then fly back to Grand Junction, so you're kind of over a flat desert kind of area instead of Denver, and then fly down the mountains.  So you're not going over the Rockies this year?  No, I am.  I have no other choice.  So right now, you're already freaking out. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, I'm not happy about the transportation.  Why didn't you go the other way?  Because there were no flights available.  I put Kenny on it.  He checked every single thing.  There was no way to go through Salt Lake City.  Wow.  Because I waited so long because I didn't want to go.  Right, right.  All right, get to your story.  Get to your story.  So I was supposed to stay at the house with everybody, and my girlfriend and her sister's mother is there.  She's been there for quite a while, and she talks a lot. 
[00:12:30]  She talks a lot.  About what?  I don't know, but she talks a lot.  During movies.  During movies?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And my girlfriend says, you know, Mom, shut up.  Like, she'll be blunt with her.  Just quiet.  And so your girl realizes she talks too much.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So it's kind of a known thing. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  When did you start with the movies?  When did you first, like, watch her in a movie, and she started chit-chatting?  The first night I met her.  What movie was it?  I'm sure it was an easy movie to follow.  No, it was an episode of The X-Files.  Oh, okay.  Years ago.  Oh, all right.  And we're just sitting there in the living room, and then a conversation sparked up.  Yeah.  And I'm just trying to be polite, but I'm like, I'm watching the frigging X-Files here.  I got to concentrate a little bit.  I just, what? 
[00:13:30]  And then, you know, my girlfriend will tell her to be quiet, and then that'll work for  like a minute, and then, hey, how you doing?  How's that work going?  Well, she's small talking?  Small talk.  Not even, like, talk about the movie that's being watched?  Small talk!  Driving me batty!  Driving me batty!  So she's out there.  She's out there.  Your girl's sister. 
[00:14:00]  And the kids.  Three kids.  Who like dropping into the bedroom when you're asleep, and crawling up on the bed, and then  getting on their hands and knees right over your face until you wake up.  So it's like a horror movie.  If I opened my eyes and saw a kid's face two inches away from my head, they'd be flying  me back in the cargo hold in a wooden box.  Yeah, that would be...  I'd die right there.  Wait, so they warned you that the kids like to crawl in bed with you?  Yeah, because my girlfriend went out there like a couple of months ago by herself, and 
[00:14:30]  she goes, oh, it was such a great time.  The boys just like to, you know, three in the morning, they're jumping on the bed.  And coming into the bedroom and saying hi.  Oh, really?  Are they?  Somehow that's not adorable to me.  Especially during my vacation.  Can't you just lock the door?  No.  Why?  Because then they...  Oh, they start pounding? 
[00:15:00]  They start banging on the door.  Would that annoy you?  Dude, you can't even imagine how annoyed I'd be.  So you wouldn't even be able to deal with it on any level?  On any level.  And this is like...  But they're family.  I understand.  I know you're not married and all that, but this is family to you.  Exactly.  That's why I'm going out.  It's your girl, sister, kids.  That's why I'm going out there.  But there's a certain line between visiting family and being tortured during your vacation. 
[00:15:30]  So, I am staying at a hotel.  I am staying at a hotel very close to the house.  Can I stop for a second?  Yes.  At that moment, a lot of people just looked at their radios and either said, you lucky son of a bitch.  Yeah.  Or how the F did he get that done?  Right.  I, uh...  You're staying at a hotel.  Yes.  And your girl's staying with her sister and the family at the house. 
[00:16:00]  The whole time.  Well, that's what she wants...  And how far is the hotel?  That's what she wants to do.  The hotel's probably five minutes away at most.  It's very close.  So you're barely going to be hanging out with them.  No, no.  I will be.  I just won't be sleeping there.  I'll stay there on, like, Christmas Eve, you know, Christmas Day, things like that.  But if I need to get out, I am going to go to the hotel. 
[00:16:30]  That's hilarious.  I have a little skate pod.  And I do plan on renting a ridiculous sports car just to drive around.  But you know these kids are going to wonder where Uncle Anthony is.  I know.  Uncle Anthony's at the hotel, and he'll be here at some point.  And I'll play with them.  It'll be fun.  I'll play.  It'll be great.  But then I don't have to get woken up at three in the morning.  I'm on vacation.  Just throw money at him.  That's what I'll do. 
[00:17:00]  And then you'll be able to stay at the hotel as long as you want.  The little rug rat will be on your chest.  That sounds like fun.  You'll wake up and go, Uncle Anthony, and you're like, little tyke.  Shut up.  It doesn't sound like fun.  It does.  It's one of my nightmares.  I'm amazed you got this done.  And yes, yes, it is an amazing story of how I got it done.  No, he's afraid that what's going to happen is the kids are going to see him sleepwalking  and then say, how come Uncle Anthony stands in the living room in his underpants and salutes?  Why is he hailing a cab alone in the living room? 
[00:17:30]  How'd you get this done?  Well.  Did you have to kind of like carefully bring it up?  It was a negotiation.  It was a negotiation.  Really?  Yeah.  And it was deemed that it's fair to me during my vacation, which I need to wind down.  You know how this show is.  It's just nonstop the whole time.  So I need time to relax and wind down. 
[00:18:00]  If I come back from a vacation and I have not vacationed, I've spent it like up, not sleeping, nerve rattled, I'm going to come back here a mess.  So, you know, that's part of it.  I have to have a getaway.  So I just picture me and Buddy will be at the hotel bar and then watching movies.  Oh, he's loving it.  Yeah.  Because he's got the great excuse.  Well, I'm going to go check out Anthony at the hotel. 
[00:18:30]  Let me tell you something.  I don't think Buddy's too fond of mom's conversations either.  I don't think.  Dude, get double beds.  He'll end up sleeping there.  I don't think, you know, some of the conversations that pop up are as entertaining as maybe the movies you want to watch.  Why, has Buddy indicated that?  He could have said something in a text, a passing text.  Or maybe when you guys are drinking, you're just discussing.  Don't blow up his spot.  For hours.  Don't blow up his spot.  Hours. 
[00:19:00]  Don't blow up his spot.  That's not cool.  No, I'm not blowing up his spot.  Believe me.  Believe me.  Yeah, so I have to go out to Colorado and that's what I'm doing.  I'm going to be staying at a hotel for most of the time.  Down the road from where the Christmas holiday celebrations will be happening.  I think it's going to be better for everybody because daytime I'll come over.  I'll be all chipper and fun and in a good mood.  I'll play with the kids.  Yeah, but daytime for you starts at like three in the afternoon. 
[00:19:30]  Exactly.  So it's going to last a couple hours and boom, back to the hotel.  And you're talking about three kids under 10 so then they're ready for bed around seven  or eight.  You're going to be spending four hours with these kids tops.  A couple of days?  Christmas Eve, I'm there.  And I guarantee knowing you, a couple of those days you're not even going to show up at  the house.  If I got the cold rag on my head, it means I had a rough night.  I might have to do a phone call.  Oh my God, you rock.  You've got to write a book. 
[00:20:00]  That's almost impossible to get done.  Yeah, I know.  Really.  Can I ask, like, when it first came up, like, did you say, like, did she say, like, we'll  go, we'll stay there?  And you went, like, I don't know.  Maybe we should stay at a hotel.  And she went, no, no, we can't.  How did that, how did that first get back?  No, she said, she goes, I'm not staying at a hotel because I want to, you know, I'm  going out there to see my sister and the boys and everybody.  I'm staying there.  I'm like, oh.  Uh-huh.  And then my wheels had to start spinning. 
[00:20:30]  And I had to, you know, kind of, I had to put the point across that although I'm very  fond of everybody, I can't be in that situation during my vacation time.  And it's nothing, you know, I never want to be a bad guy either.  I never want to come off as the bad guy.  So it's very hard for me to tell people that, look, I appreciate your hospitality, but I can't  stay in a house with three young children like that. 
[00:21:00]  And a mother-in-law that, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.  And the yapping mother-in-law without, you know, a place to go.  You get up at four in the morning and it's like when you're off, you would like to sleep  in.  It's a very rare treat.  Ho-ho.  Exactly.  So what was the negotiation?  Correcto mundo.  What was the negotiation like?  The negotiation was-  Where was the turning point?  It's that it would be more fair- 
[00:21:30]  For everybody involved?  For everyone involved if I stayed at a hotel.  Was it an argument?  No, it wasn't an argument.  It was a discussion.  It was discussed.  Was cold, hard cash involved?  No, there was no cash transaction involved in this discussion.  No, like, a little gift?  No gift.  No.  This was just a straightforward discussion and-  God bless you, man.  Now I'm staying in a hotel.  All right. 
[00:22:00]  And that's how we start today.  Yeah.  So you're looking forward for your week off.  Yeah, because now, see, I was dreading.  That's another thing that came into the discussion.  I said, look, I'll be honest with you.  I'm dreading this.  I'm dreading everything from getting on the flight to being there and not being vacationing.  Being awakened at all hours.  Screaming, kids. 
[00:22:30]  I can't watch a movie.  If a mother-in-law wants to know what size shoes I'm wearing.  Does she ever ask you that?  I don't know, but it's just something else equally as inane.  But is it at good times in the movies?  Or is she aware that you're watching?  Dude, it is like a turning point in a movie.  It's Michael Corleone ready to shoot McCluskey.  And then what happens?  And then it's just, hey, did I tell you about the time back in 1967 when Jen did this?  Well, she wasn't born in 67. 
[00:23:00]  Whatever.  I gotcha.  I just want to make people older than they are.  Does it bug you, though?  Have you ever wanted to say, shut up?  Yeah.  I have honestly wanted to say, could you shut up?  I'm watching this movie.  Could you shut up?  For two lousy minutes.  Are you watching the same movie I'm watching? 
[00:23:30]  Because this part is integral.  Integral to the plot line of the movie.  Could you shut up?  You got to phrase it like this.  For the love of God, will you shut up?  30 seconds.  Is she one of these talkers where she'll ask you something and you start to answer her,  but she's already on to the next thing?  Or does she?  That'll happen.  Or is she at least a good listener?  That'll happen.  I hate those people.  And then there's the conversation, like if there's a few people in the room, the conversation 
[00:24:00]  will start up.  And I will stay fixated on the TV.  Don't turn your eyes.  Don't turn your eyes.  Because if you turn your eyes and make eye contact, all of a sudden you're in the conversation.  And I'm just like...  But I'm here in the conversation, and the fact that I don't want to get into the conversation  is distracting me from the movie in itself.  In and of itself.  Well, it's a full-time job just to stay out of the conversation.  Exactly.  I get you.  Do it like Keith.  Keith Robinson is the greatest way of doing this.  He's the most obnoxious pig on the planet. 
[00:24:30]  But if someone is talking at the table, he won't address the person.  He'll actually look at...  Like, just go, shut her up.  Shut her up, or I will.  And the person doesn't really know that Keith is talking about it.  But it's so obnoxious.  Oh, that's a good one.  I've been talking to somebody, and he'll be behind just going, for the love of God,  will you shut her up?  And they'll look around a little bit uncomfortably.  It's like, it can't be me he's talking about.  Nobody thinks he's spoken about like that.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Yep. 
[00:25:00]  Well, good luck to you.  It sounds like it's going to be an adventure.  Yeah.  Between the flight over the Rocky.  Yeah.  I just got to hope for good weather.  I'm like, it's like I'm going west in the 1800s.  I'm hoping for good weather.  Well, and it's early winter, you know.  I'm sure there's not much wind going on out there at this time of year.  And I looked at the temperature, because I have it on my iPhone.  As a matter of fact, let me just, just to finish this up, let me look at the temperature  right now in Grand Junction. 
[00:25:30]  Well, because I have it.  I have it right here on my iPhone.  Why would anyone move to Grand Junction?  Hey, it's 15 degrees.  Is that the wind chill?  No, that's the temperature.  That's the temperature.  And you know how I enjoy the cold weather.  Oh, I'm a big fan of the cold weather.  And the whole week. 
[00:26:00]  I'm getting a feeling that you really don't want to do this trip.  13 degrees.  I'm just, you know, if they lived in the area, I wouldn't mind it at all.  I'd be there all the time.  Why don't you do separate holidays this year?  No, I can't do that.  Slow down.  I got the hotel, okay?  Slow down.  You got a cool chick.  She would understand.  Yeah.  Separate holidays.  I don't think that's going to.  Last minute, separate holidays.  I don't think that's going to happen.  Why?  Bring your pal talk and you'll be there in spirit. 
[00:26:30]  They did not.  They could put a pal talk screen where you would be sitting at the table and there you are.  It ain't going to happen.  You could even eat the same meal from the comfort of your warm mansion.  You're an ass.  How funny would that be, man?  So start talking, Anthony Lee, and what did mom say?  All right, we got to take our first break.  We're a little late.  Yeah, a creepy songwriter died.  And we'll tell you who it is next, if you don't know yet. 
[00:27:00]  But when he sang his songs, he just would bring out that creepy feeling within me.  And I don't know.  Really?  You didn't like him?  No.  Instead of a warm, fuzzy feeling, you just got this creepy feeling of just death around you.  I'll explain next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning to everybody. 
[00:27:30]  Hope you had a good weekend.  Not a boring one, actually.  Did you?  Kind of.  I went to Ron and Fez's Christmas party on Saturday night in Brooklyn.  That was kind of cool.  How'd that work out for you?  I don't know.  It seemed to be in the middle of like...  Well, not the ghetto, but industrial ghetto?  Yeah, yeah.  Warehouse.  I decided to drive there, and I was like, there's no way I'm coming back to a car that's not broken into. 
[00:28:00]  I was convinced.  And I was like, ah, what the hell?  It was a great parking spot, and I knew that just has to mean, you know, problems.  Trouble.  Graffiti all over the walls, all over the place.  And they pretty much had their Christmas party at like a hip-hop rave slash gangster club.  Was it in the back of the club, though?  Like, sometimes there's another room.  We had a little room to the side, but then it was part of the main club, and I don't know,  all of a sudden, like around one in the morning, like, two black DJs come in and just start rocking. 
[00:28:30]  And then you got all these, like, kind of Ron and Fez nerdy types, like, just busting it up, man, on the dance floor.  I'm like, what is going on here?  Hopefully someone filmed Fezzy, because Fezzy went off on the dance floor.  Did he?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure they filmed him.  He doesn't like when he's filmed.  With a tribe called Quest playing, and he's just moving.  Wow.  And then I watched some football yesterday, and that was it, really. 
[00:29:00]  I was all about Call of Duty 4.  I'm a lieutenant now, by the way.  Oh.  I worked my way up.  Of course you did.  Yep.  It's all about it.  That game is huge now.  It's taken off.  Are you going to bring that game to Colorado?  Well, yeah, I should.  Yeah, you should.  You really should.  Hook it up to the hotel TV.  You should just have your whole system FedExed out there.  The whole, everything.  Computers, chair. 
[00:29:30]  How great would that be?  All right.  Listen, we've got to move into other things.  A great singer died.  I'll tell you this much, man.  When I moved into Onondaga Dorm in Geneseo, my roommate at the time, you know, they room  you up with people from all over New York State, and my roommate freshman year was into  Dan Fogelberg and Billy Joel. 
[00:30:00]  I'm like, what is wrong with this kid?  Come on, Fogelberg.  Yes.  Yes.  All right, cool.  And this kid would, like, just crank up his Dan Fogelberg, and I remember going, these  songs aren't nice.  It just brings a creepy feeling to your soul.  Which one is this?  Leader of the band?  Yeah, listen to this.  Do you get a nice, warm, fuzzy feeling when you hear this?  This one was written about his father.  Really?  He was a band leader, and got him into music. 
[00:30:30]  Really?  I don't know any Dan Fogelberg.  His dead father, by the way, of course.  Well, listen to the hook, because now it's about him.  Only child alone and wild, a cabinetmaker's son.  His hands were meant for different work, and his heart was known to none.  He left his arm and went his long and solitary way.  Can you pause that? 
[00:31:00]  So, basically, his dad was a big drinker or a pot smoker.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  Kind of left.  I mean, nowadays, making cabinets is very lucrative.  Yeah.  But when Dan Fogelberg wrote about his cabinet-making father, not making a good living doing that,  I'd imagine.  You'd probably forget to put handles on it.  Right.  All stone.  There's a cabinet that's all nailed in.  No door.  Giant piggy bank for plates, they just crash and break when you drop them in. 
[00:31:30]  A slot.  Rotten cabinetmaker.  Yeah, it looks like dear old dad didn't pay attention in school.  Those cabinets suck.  You forget to put bottoms in them.  Right.  You put your plate, it just falls through.  This guy's cabinets blow.  He should die.  And he did.  Awful band leader.  And I know we're going to get calls now, but I said it.  It's a lucrative business nowadays, because I'm trying to get cabinets and stuff for my  house, and it's ridiculous.  These guys make a fine living.  Don't call Fogelberg cabinet company.  No, but no way.  He's trying to glorify the fact that his father made cabinets back in, what, the 50s? 
[00:32:00]  I have no idea.  He just opened the door, and he never nailed it, so the whole door just pulls off.  And then you put a teacup on it, and the cabinet falls off the wall and comes crashing into  the sink.  Like, this Fogelberg bum is not a good cabinetmaker.  He should be in Yee Poor House.  So a little Fogelberg decided to write a song about it just to glorify it.  He had to change the name from Fogelberg's Cabinets to Fogelberg's Piles of Timber. 
[00:32:30]  And Crushed China.  Kindling Wood.  What a bum.  I think we got a bid.  Let's listen to the leader of the band.  Continue.  And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay.  Hopefully divorce.  Prostate cancer.  Divorce from his mommy.  The gene for prostate cancer.  So mommy can find a quiet man of music.  A real breadwinner.  Denied a simpler fate. 
[00:33:00]  He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  He tried to be a soldier.  He washed out of the army.  I was just like, don't ask, don't tell.  It was like a Biloxi Blues moment.  The old fruity cabinetmaker was on his knees in the shower when Sarge walked in.  His cabinet sucked and he couldn't even survive the military.  What the hell is this?  A crappy cabinet?  His cabinet sucked and so did he.  I hate an unlocked cabinet pile and a queer. 
[00:33:30]  That's all he put in cabinets is men's magazines until they finally crashed through because it was so heavy with men's bondage magazines.  A nice man all of a sudden now.  Oh, now we're just bashing him incompetent.  Making balsa wood cabinets sort of lighter.  We'd make them out of sheet metal.  They had no personality at all.  A shink.  A shink.  And he wouldn't even round out the edges so people would constantly cut their knuckles and hands on the cabinets. 
[00:34:00]  How do you make cabinets funny, Jimmy?  You rock.  All right.  Let's get back to the leader of the band.  This is Dan Fogelberg who died over the weekend of prostate cancer at the age of 56.  You got to get your thing checked out, guys.  Absolutely.  You get that crap taken care of early, you're going to survive the prostate cancer.  He was a cabinet maker, but he never realized that you couldn't use nails on glass.  He tried being Fogelberg's glass cabinet emporium and he put the nail on. 
[00:34:30]  Damn it.  Back to the drawing board.  Time to try something else out that I'm going to fail at.  Crazy glowing in cabinets.  So what happened with him in the military?  I don't know.  Because he was into his music?  He probably hung out with Jane Fonda and sat on North Vietnamese tanks.  He was a traitor.  Well, let me hear one star on that Dan Fogelberg Sr.  Oh, man.  All right.  All right, another one here.  All right, give me another, little Danny.  Give me another pane of glass. 
[00:35:00]  Damn, I stink at this.  Someone wants glass front cabinets.  Now they're saying it was his grandfather, not his dad.  I guess we got some Fogelberg fans.  Wait, we got a Fogelberg fan on the line.  Greg in Maryland, what's up?  Hey, it's not his dad that was the cabinet maker.  It's his dad's dad, according to the song. 
[00:35:30]  How do you get that?  Well, listen to the beginning again.  Oh, he's talking about the son of a cabinet maker.  Oh.  Well, his grandfather was an awful cabinet maker.  Well, that's even worse in the 30s.  He was a cabinet maker who never associated with Negroes.  With a name like Fogelberg, he's lucky he was here making cabinets.  Well, he was either here or Warsaw.  Those weren't cabinets he was making.  Let's get back to this.  Oh, the wooden boxes. 
[00:36:00]  Let's get back to this song.  He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait.  He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand.  What?  Velvet hand?  Gentle means of sculpting souls.  Took me years to understand.  Oh, he was a pain.  He just, like, smacked the backhand at him a few times.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, this is about Dan Fogelberg today. 
[00:36:30]  Blood runs through my instrument, and his song is in my soul.  Oh, boy.  See?  I'm getting that creepy feeling I used to get when I was in college.  Turn it off.  His song went through my prostate.  And it hit my colon, too.  Poor Dan.  I got to get it checked, though.  That's scary.  What's prostate cancer?  It's scary, man.  You should have gotten the old digit.  Very curable, though, if you get your crap checked out.  You got to get your, uh, you got to get the, uh... 
[00:37:00]  It's the old digit.  Camera.  Yeah.  Well, first, he just gives you the digit to make sure there's nothing going on in there.  That's only if you have strep throat.  Yeah, for you.  It said it's got to feel soft and spongy.  By the way, uh...  Dr. Steve said that.  Wait, they check your prostate that way, but for colon cancer, they have to put...  Oh, yeah.  He had a prostate problem.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, prostate cancer, yeah.  Oh, okay.  He had advanced prostate cancer that he's been fighting since, uh, 2004.  Ugh, it sucks.  Uh, same old Lang Syne is another one that just creeps you out when you hear it. 
[00:37:30]  What the hell's that about?  It just gives you that creepy feeling.  We break a dose for now.  Try to reach beyond the happiness.  But be the one who has...  What feeling do you get, really, when you hear this?  It's kind of a cross between a rod and murderous rage.  You can't decide.  It's soft.  I like this kind of music.  It's like James Taylor type of... 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Easy charm.  I'm not getting the creepy feeling.  I'm just getting, like...  I remember hearing it years and years ago.  Yeah.  Longer is creepy.  When mom would put the radio on.  All right, here's Longer.  One more by Dan Fogelberg.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's a good song.  I remember this one.  This is a huge hit for him.  Aw.  Longer than there have been stars up in the heavens. 
[00:38:30]  I've been in love with you.  How many weddings was this played at?  Right.  They look into each other's eyes and dance.  You Scott take Lacey?  Exactly.  Heavier than every anchor.  Longer than that doctor's middle finger.  It might have helped.  Let's boy in for the brick.  Jesus. 
[00:39:00]  I Am Legend was number one at the box office.  Of course it was.  Huge.  Biggest December opening ever.  Another hit.  And your car opens up the whole movie there, Anthony.  Is that the opening of the movie?  And now everyone's going to say that you were ripping off Will Smith when you bought your  film.  Hey, I like your I Am Legend car.  The exact one.  The same color.  Stripes.  Everything, right?  Everything.  What is he doing it?  Does he have it for long or does he wreck it?  I didn't see the movie. 
[00:39:30]  I heard that that's how the movie pretty much starts.  Yeah.  And it's also going to be the kit car.  Yeah.  They're doing Knight Rider, the movie.  Yeah, and they're making the Shelby, the kit car.  I guess they officially ran out of TV shows to make into films.  Yeah.  They're going with Knight Rider, the movie.  And that is in Mustangs in a lot of friggin' movies.  And your car is going to be the new kit.  Great.  And no David Hasselhoff is the main guy, but he's going to have a cameo in that movie,  if anyone cares.  As the drunk guy on the ground eating a burger. 
[00:40:00]  As the homeless guy.  Michael, you're drunk.  Oh, that blows.  I'm going to have to get a new car.  Let's say hi to Bobby in Jersey.  Bobby.  Yeah, bro.  Dan Fogelberg, he's got this song.  I think it's called the Christmas Shoe Song.  Oh, no, Ro.  Not Christmas Shoes.  Is that Fogelberg?  It makes me cry.  Yeah.  My wife, she listens to her all the time.  I tell her, shut this crap off.  I don't think Fogelberg does that. 
[00:40:30]  Who does Christmas Shoes?  It's not Fogelberg.  Wait, Bobby, do you know the connection with Christmas Shoes with Anthony?  No, I have no clue.  Oh, you've got to linger longer, my friend.  I guess that's going to have to explain it.  All right.  Thanks, Bobby.  Yeah.  Sal plays, of course, my mother's husband, Sal.  Whenever he hears Christmas Shoes, he cries.  This is so sad, Ro.  And then when the shoes, when he gets the shoes. 
[00:41:00]  This song is hilarious.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  What's this song about?  I'm trying to buy that last gift or two.  Not really in the Christmas mood.  Not in the Christmas mood.  Standing right in front of me.  Little boy winging anxiously.  He's waiting.  Oh, anxiously.  Facing around like little boys do.  You know how little boys will do that.  In his hands he held.  A pair of shoes.  A pair of shoes. 
[00:41:30]  They're the Christmas Shoes, Ro!  So what's the problem?  The boy bought some shoes.  Well, for his mom.  Well.  She needed orthotics.  You know, when it came, it's time to pay.  I couldn't believe what I heard him say.  No!  Sir, I want to buy these shoes.  Sir, I want to buy these.  For my mom.  But can I just buy one because Heather Mills is my mother?  Because I'm receiving these shoes are just her size. 
[00:42:00]  Just her size.  That's nice.  He's buying shoes.  Who gives that?  What a crap.  Hurry.  Daddy says there's not much time.  Oh, boy.  What?  Dinner's starting?  She's been sick for quite a while.  Sick?  What?  Wait, hold on.  If we pause this so we can ask a question, but I don't want to step on the lyrics.  Yeah.  Daddy says there's not much time.  She's been sick for a while.  Yeah.  Isn't that the last thing?  How about a pillow?  She's sick.  Satin pillow?  She's not going to have scrapes around the house.  How about a suit jacket with folded arms already built into it? 
[00:42:30]  What are shoes?  He just wants shoes he can bring back and say nobody used them.  This kid sucks.  A pair of Christmas shoes for an almost corpse.  He's thinking.  She's not going to be able to walk.  I think he's buying the shoes for himself.  He's got a nice excuse to put on mommy's shoes after she grows.  Because he gets those feelings.  And the father's somewhat a morbid father.  Harry, son, there's not much.  I'm going to buy mom some shoes.  Well, Harry, there's not much time.  Not much time.  She'll be dead before nine.  Before you even get back with the shoes. 
[00:43:00]  I'll crack the walnuts.  We'll eat them.  You put the shoes on her.  And then we'll call the coroner.  Here's Common Ion from Pal Talk.  I want to hear the other version of the song Christmas Oven Mitts.  The dog feels so silly with them, but they prevent him from clawing mother's ribs.  Let's see what happens with Christmas shoes here.  Could you hurry me, sir?  Daddy says there's not much time. 
[00:43:30]  You see, she's been sick for quite a while.  I know these shoes will make her smile.  I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight.  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  See, mama's going to meet Jesus in slut pumps.  That's what he bought her. 
[00:44:00]  Why is she going to meet Jesus?  Did she commit a rape in Death Wish 2?  You're going to meet him.  Yeah?  Mama made Christmas good at our house.  Certainly did.  Most years she just did without.  Tell me, sir, what am I going to do?  Somehow I've got to buy you.  What, he didn't have money?  This kid's BSing like those kids that sell candy.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  They don't have no basketball game to get to.  No.  In Florida, wherever the hell the tournament's being held.  I'll never forget the look on his face when he said, mama's going to look so great.  No, she's not.  Mom's going to look so...  She's going to look purple.  Well, it sounded like he said, mom's going to look so great.  Oh, well, that might be.  You didn't even have to use the purple joke in that one.  Is she going to look great when the coroner's sawing her skull open in her new shoes? 
[00:45:00]  Cutting that Y incision.  We're going to leave the shoes on, Sam.  That's the family's incision.  Leave the Christmas shoes, Sam.  Jim C.  Wow, Quince, I think I would look very pretty in them.  I agree, Sam.  I love your Asian cabs.  Very pronounced.  Quincey's stealing the shoes and giving them to Sam.  I'm outraged.  Stupid coroner's going to throw them in the garbage.  Of course he will.  Yeah.  Get these off her.  I got a job to do.  He'll remove them from her feet with like a bat. 
[00:45:30]  Swat them off her dead feet.  Because they're a little stuck because of her swollen feet.  He'll pick up an aluminum bat and Louisville slugger those cheap shoes off.  I like the thought of her laying in the coffin for like 10 years as her toenails continue to grow through the shoes.  Oh, my God.  I don't imagine the answers on those second-rate Christmas shoes, Clarice.  What's this part? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, it's the kid.  The kid sings Christmas shoes.  Are you kidding me?  And he sent that little boy to remind me what Christmas is all about.  What is it about?  Depression and dead people?  I want to buy these shoes.  Oh, Ro, look, the kid's singing, Ro. 
[00:46:30]  The kid's singing, Ro, about the Christmas shoes.  I'm from Baltimore.  That's why I talk like this, Ro.  Oh, boy.  It's not much time.  Quick, get her shoes.  How about medicine?  Exactly.  As they're putting the oxygen mask on her face, this dumb kid is trying to put shoes on.  The left on the right, she's struggling because that's her ankles.  She has elephant ties into the ankles.  How about swollen, diabetic feet?  How about daddy go to the singles bar and get me a new mommy? 
[00:47:00]  I'm going to be a little lonely now.  How about some Christmas insurance so mother can get medication for your dumb shoes?  Oh, no.  It's Jesus.  Tonight.  Oh, tonight.  Tonight's tonight.  Hey, Justin, he got back just in time with the Christmas shoes.  Great.  So, yeah.  So, his Christmas is going to be wrecked for the rest of his life.  Believe me.  His mommy dies on Christmas, and this kid's supposed to enjoy Christmas?  The important lesson in that song is that kid, when buying those shoes, keep the receipt. 
[00:47:30]  Can I bring these back?  They were never worn.  They were thrown onto an almost dead person for 10 minutes, and then the paramedics took them off.  Oh, in a twist of fate, the coroner found the shoes a little sexy.  Got him thinking.  It certainly did.  And he had stirrups, so what the hell?  I'm just going to do it for a minute, Sam.  No one has to know.  Those Christmas shoes were leaning on Quincy's shoulders.  His stupid kernel of corn teeth in her face. 
[00:48:00]  At least her ass isn't flat, Sam.  Oh, coagulated blood at the blottom of her stupid ankles.  At the blottom.  At the blottom.  Her feet are all dehydrated, so he's got a shore like a horse.  A few nails in there.  Whatever the kid wants.  Thud, thud, thud.  That's hilarious. 
[00:48:30]  There's a serial killer named Jerome Brutus who would kill women and then photograph their feet in different shoes.  Yeah, he was a good boy.  Sexy guy.  And in that song, he said that's what Christmas is all about, right?  Yeah, well, you don't have to go back.  I kind of heard that lyric.  Well, this is what Christmas is all about for this lady.  Huh?  Like to say.  Tanya Owen feels anything but blessed today.  She told her kids this afternoon that there will be no Christmas.  That's because someone broke into her house sometime over the past week and stole everything. 
[00:49:00]  Not only the family's personal belongings, but their remodeling tools, their Christmas gifts, and even the family Christmas tree.  I can't believe somebody would walk out my front door with my stuff and my crucifixity.  And they had to make more than one foot for the amount of stuff they could.  We're in a silly mood today, man.  Wow. 
[00:49:30]  They even took the Christmas tree.  Wow.  That's like a Grinch thing.  What creeps is right.  All right.  We got the things to do.  Stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's David Tell whoring up my comedy dates.  Sound familiar?  Catch me at Caroline's Comedy Club, December 27th through the 30th.  That's New York, New York.  212-757-4100.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:50:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Hey, Jim, how was Scranton?  It was great.  It was great.  The crowds were very hardcore O&A fans, man.  Oh, yeah, I got a text from you, and you rarely write me when you're on the road, but you're like, man, these people are animals.  Yeah, they were very hardcore fans, and, you know, it was good. 
[00:50:30]  I think it would have been, it was actually open seats because they didn't take enough reservations.  They hadn't done a show like this before.  So, they were sold out, but you actually could have come and gotten in because they didn't over-reserve enough.  They didn't want to send fans away pissed off, they said.  So, it just wasn't handled, like, probably the way it would have been a little easier to get more people in.  But the shows were fantastic.  The crowds were great.  They were just, they were animals.  And how are we doing for New Year's Eve?  I don't know. 
[00:51:00]  I'm at the North Fork Theater, and thanks, man, in Long Island, which is the old Westbury, Ticketmaster.  And maybe later we can give away some tickets or something.  I got a couple pairs left to give away on New Year's Eve.  I'm working with Marina Franklin.  And it's all non-HBO material, by the way.  It's all new stuff.  Very, very good.  All right.  Nice.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Heading into the Christmas season here, obviously.  And we played this on Friday.  It's worth another play.  A German guy performing, Oh, Christmas Tree, by, can you say this word? 
[00:51:30]  By farting into a recorder.  The video's hilarious.  It should be up on onaradio.com later today.  But basically, this guy bends over and uses this instrument, and he kind of belts out a tune.  Toots out a tune.  He toots out a tune.  Here it is.  Here it is. 
[00:52:00]  There you go. 
[00:52:30]  What do you say after that?  I don't know, man.  How do you practice that?  I don't know.  I'm stupefied by that one.  All right.  Andy Pettit did the drugs, huh?  Did the what?  Growth of the...  Human growth hormone.  But he admitted to doing it twice.  Twice for healing.  Basically, the bare minimum you could do this stuff, he'll admit to.  That's what makes me laugh when I was reading these articles over the weekend. 
[00:53:00]  Wasn't that before it was illegal, too?  Like, he did it when it was still not a banned substance.  He just wanted to come back from an injury, and he did it just twice.  And he said, you know, I had a commitment to my team.  I wanted to be there for him, so I was trying to heal up.  I did it twice.  Yeah.  He said...  And he said two times, like 20 times in his little speech.  Right.  Well, he'll admit to the bare minimum, is what it comes down to.  Like, all right, I'll admit it, but I'll only admit to twice.  So now all eyes are on Mr. Clemens there.  What does HGH do?  It just makes your muscles grow. 
[00:53:30]  I don't know.  I don't even know what it does, but apparently he was told it'll help heal his elbow.  Faster.  Faster, yeah.  Yeah, it just speeds up everything, I guess.  So now everyone's looking at Roger Clemens.  What do you think Roger Clemens is going to do?  Make a speech that inspires everyone from the owner's box.  Hey, I did some steroids.  Thank you.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Pettit's nodding because he know he did it. 
[00:54:00]  Roger Clemens is shaking his head no.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  They're all clapping their feet like steroid using horses.  Goodness gracious.  She's the worst.  She's the stupid Muppet face.  God, we got some mileage out of this this year, huh?  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  My favorite clip of the year, by the way, is the Susan Waldman.  Is it really?  The long form?  The long form, yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Can we get the long form?  We haven't done the long form in a while.  It just lends itself to be screamed at.  Yeah.  You know, I was telling Anthony before the show, too.  I'm a Yankee hater.  I'm a Mets fan.  I don't like the Yankees.  And it would be great to kind of, you know, have fun with this whole thing.  But you just know it's every team.  Everyone's doing it.  Stop.  It's every team.  So it's like, what am I going to do?  Not every one, but yeah, every team.  Every team's involved with this whole steroid thing.  You got it?  Here's the long form. 
[00:55:00]  Susan Waldman.  Thank you all.  That's Roger Clemens.  Well, they came and got me out of Texas.  And I can tell you it's a privilege to be back.  I'll be talking to you all soon.  Wow.  Roger Clemens is in Georgia's box.  And Roger Clemens is coming back.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, 
[00:55:30]  Roger Clemens standing right in George Steinbrenner's box,  announcing he is back.  Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee.  And there we go, John.  You don't have to worry about who's going to take that spot in the rotation.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Bedlam.  There's a big grin on Jorge Posada's face.  A grin.  He had it new.  Besides, Roger Clemens is now a Yankee.  That's the best part of the clip. 
[00:56:00]  And now we don't have to discuss who takes that place in the rotation.  That's the best part of the clip is her description of what you should see.  There was a grin.  Not even like, hey, in the dugout.  It's like, you should see.  You got to see this.  You should see this.  You're not going to believe this.  It's amazing.  I wish you were here to see what I'm seeing.  There's a grin and someone new.  Yeah.  There was happier faces and more excitement at the Christmas shoes house.  Of all the dramatic things, the boy is crying, the father's calling a prostitute, and the mother's dead.  The father is begging them for the receipt so he can take back the shoes. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, and Father dramatic.  Roger Clemens is standing in George's box.  Unfortunately, Dan Fogelberg's grandfather made it, so they're falling to their deaths on the upper deck.  I don't think you're going to have to wonder anymore who's going to end up in that coffin.  And then Roger goes, what, five for nine?  It sucked.  Just the worst record ever. 
[00:57:00]  Here we go.  Play that part again.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Oh, let's see.  Let's see.  Big grin.  Big grin.  Okay.  Jorge Posada's face.  Andy Pettit knew.  Big size Roger Clemens is now a Yankee.  In the Yankee dugout?  Are they here?  Who's holding it up?  Mattingly when he was the batting coach?  Is he just holding signs up in other Yankees' faces?  Yeah, what the hell was that?  Holding it up in Spanish for Rivera, Japanese for Matsui.  She's no worse. 
[00:57:30]  How about this?  Of all the mediocre things I've seen.  Yeah.  Oh, Steve from Bayshore saying, I hope Susan Waltman's kids has to buy her a pair of shoes  this Christmas.  Special shoes.  Stupid fraggle rock lips.  She should be popping up in a balcony making that speech.  Yuck.  What over-the-top zilch analysis.  Oh, net as high.  I love it for me.  How do you listen to Yankee games anymore?  And she's trying to raise her voice, but, you know, a guy might be able to pull that 
[00:58:00]  off with the yelling voice.  I just came out like screaming.  Crazy woman.  She could just as easily be screaming, I told you kids to keep it down.  Days of our lives is on.  Yeah.  That's what she should be yelling in that voice.  Get in the house.  The lemon bundt cake is ready.  Stupid lemon bundt cake.  All right.  There you go.  We talked about I Am Legend.  Alvin and the Chipmunks somehow makes $45 million this weekend. 
[00:58:30]  What?  What?  What?  What happened?  That Alvin and the Chipmunks movie did really well.  Yeah.  As we were joking about Jason Lee with Kevin Smith and goofing on the fact that he's doing  that movie.  It's...  Well, it's a kid's movie.  It's huge.  What else are the parents going to do this past weekend?  Shop and bring their little...  They can see I Am Legend.  Their little kid to Alvin and the Chipmunks.  26% good reviews and people went to the box office anyway and the movies and checked 
[00:59:00]  out Alvin and the Chipmunks.  All right.  Hey, Maxim's got a top 10 worst things to happen to men in 2007 list.  Oh, yeah?  Worst things?  And they got the best things.  Which one do you want to hear first?  We won't do all of them.  I like worst.  You like worst over best?  Yeah.  Well, the best, just to go through, just to set this up, like, number 10 is the TV  Rider Strike.  That was...  Why is that good?  That was good for men this year.  Why? 
[00:59:30]  I don't...  Oh, I think because it got people out, away from their TVs.  Yeah, but why is that good?  So maybe you can go out and get some.  Keeping up with all the fine programming of the fall can be time-consuming.  Important stuff like girlfriends, yard work, and even bathing can go easily by the wayside  when there are new episodes of The Office to be watched.  Luckily, the Rider's Guild Strike has left our TVs packed with reruns and unaired episodes  of canceled crap so we can get outside and live our lives. 
[01:00:00]  Mm-hmm.  That's what it is.  You get out there and knock off a piece.  Mm.  And then some of the other ones worth mentioning.  The McRib takes a third farewell lap.  The McRib.  That's good.  Daniel Tosh, the comedian, is listed.  That's good.  That's one of the best things that happen to men.  I like to set fire to Maxim's home office.  Who's Daniel Tosh?  Exactly.  He's a pretty popular comedian.  I hear he's funny.  I've never seen his act.  So I can't...  Why is that a good thing for men?  I don't know what he does.  I guess they said he was a fresh look and offensive.  It may be. 
[01:00:30]  I can't...  I don't know what he does.  I've heard he's funny.  But I'm resentful because that's not me that they're mentioning.  Yeah, no.  I hope everyone at Maxim dies.  Of course.  No, I understand why you're not happy.  Female gamers have more sex.  I guess that came out this year, so that's why it's a good thing.  One of the best things that happened to men in 2007.  Well, for the most part, female gamers aren't the sexiest bunch.  Hey, I'm not talking about all of them.  I understand there's some very hot gamers out there.  But for the most part, especially with these fantasy role-playing games, 
[01:01:00]  you're getting girls that, ah, ah, not quite up to par.  And, you know, they tend to be a little sluttier.  They've got nothing to lose.  Well, we had a girl on our show.  She said that she played games and had the kick-ass gaming system  because it got her more, you know what.  Yeah.  She's able to meet guys that way.  And say, hey.  Dressed as a little wood elf, a little nymph,  marching through the woods.  She makes her little character look all skinny and nice. 
[01:01:30]  And then she hooks up with somebody and, whoa, she better perform.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  She's got to get the guys away from that disappointment of seeing her.  So, yeah.  That's what happens.  Maxim's top best things happened to men in 2007.  Some other ones worth mentioning.  Baseball owners tell A-Rod to F off.  But then they re-sign him.  So, what is that about?  You know the lead time on these stupid magazines.  Van Halen reunion was a great thing to happen for men in 2007.  For the men of the band. 
[01:02:00]  Science proves.  Number two is science proves that staring at boobs prolongs life.  So, now you have an excuse when you're looking at boobies  and you get caught by your chick or your wife.  You're just prolonging your life.  In a study that's likely faker than Bigfoot's hair color.  At least I keep it funny.  Yeah.  That's a hoot.  German researchers found that staring at large breasts for 10 minutes a day 
[01:02:30]  is equal to doing a half hour of cardio.  Shut the hell up.  Stop it.  German.  Are you kidding me?  How does that work?  As fake as the Bigfoot.  Is that the best they could do?  The study that's likely faker than Bigfoot's hair color.  And then in parentheses it says totally a natural redhead.  How about faker than Heather Mills toenail clippings?  That would be a little better.  Despite the redundancy on this program of that reference.  Yes, of course.  Faker than Robert Reed's Kisses of Carol. 
[01:03:00]  Well, it gets a little...  Go back into the witty zone here, though.  We know it's not true mainly because we're as heart healthy as Dick Cheney.  That means not.  Can the as, you know, we are as, and the as joke thing just stop?  And then the number one best thing to happen to men in 2007, Hayden Penetary turns 18.  Is that the best?  From Heroes.  She looked fine at 17.  What was the problem?  Best thing would be if she returned 16. 
[01:03:30]  And then Maxim's 10 worst things to happen to men in 2007.  Number 10 is the lame ending of The Sopranos.  That was bad for men in general, I guess.  But that ending gets better and better as time goes by and you think it over a little bit, right?  I still don't like it.  You still don't like it?  No, because I...  I love the fact that it...  Who was explaining that?  It's just such a big F-you to everybody.  I love that.  I do get that.  But, you know, an F-you to people that have been buying the DVDs.  And I understood what he was doing.  Couldn't leave him alive. 
[01:04:00]  Couldn't kill him.  But it was like, you know what?  Have the courage of a solid ending.  And I know that took courage.  But have a real ending.  You want to be ballsy?  Kill him.  You want to be ballsy?  Kill him off at the end.  Didn't he feel like he was forced to continue The Sopranos, though?  And maybe this was his way of going, you know what?  Go F yourself.  I never wanted to make the last season or two.  I don't know.  Maybe.  I mean, I just felt that someone should have turned on him.  Nothing happened in that last episode.  So it was just like a regular episode.  So if you want to do that, well, then the last MASH means nothing. 
[01:04:30]  The last New Heart means nothing.  The last Mary Tyler Moore means nothing.  Last episodes are important.  It's a closing for people.  And I just thought he sucked in that last ending.  I didn't like the whole episode.  The stupid truck catching fire.  Nothing happened.  When you build somebody up and you let them off without a climax at all in a movie,  that's not some brilliant move.  That's just cheesy, bad writing.  There you go.  And it was Dennis Leary who said it was a big F you.  Thank you, Iraq.  Number nine, ten worst things happened in 2007 as far as men go. 
[01:05:00]  Jimmy Dean reduces sausage from 16 to 12 ounces.  All weekend long.  Sausage.  All weekend long that came up again with the Philly crew.  So we're just walking around going, sausage, sausage, sausage, sausage, sausage, sausage.  Number eight, Evel Knievel dies.  We didn't spend a lot of time on Evel Knievel.  It's not like Evel Knievel was doing anything recently.  The hell does that matter to men?  Most men that are alive don't remember anything he was doing.  Yeah, but he was like a man's man, that guy. 
[01:05:30]  He was insane.  He was doing stuff way before anyone else was doing crazy stuff like that.  Yeah, to people over 40.  Now you go on YouTube and it's all over the place, but Evel Knievel was the first and the only one for a while.  Who else was a daredevil when he was doing it?  No one remembers that shit.  Like, oh shit, did I just drop the S-bomb?  Jesus, what's wrong with me?  It's a weird day today, man.  God, I just don't do that.  Why did I do that?  Oh well.  Because we're heading toward a little time off? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, no one remembers that crap.  That it was like a big thing.  The wide world of sports would do it.  Like Sunday afternoon, there would be a whole show around Evel Knievel doing a jump.  Yeah.  And then people just don't care anymore.  You could see the clip in two seconds on YouTube if someone does something stupid.  Like a jackass stunt.  Right.  So the daredevil is done.  Really, the daredevil is.  The only one I like is Alain Robert, that guy that climbs buildings with nothing but 
[01:06:30]  his stupid French hands, some rosin powder on his feet.  That's creepy.  He climbs the buildings with nothing.  I would love to take a hammer to his fingertips.  When he's on the 108th floor.  Right.  Just ruin his career.  Smashing of his fingers.  Watch him fall.  Ten worst things to happen to men in 2007.  Bear Grylls is exposed as a faker from Man vs. Wild.  Oh.  Did anyone, we haven't really discussed this on the show yet, did anyone check out Man  vs. Wild where he's living inside the camel for a night to keep warm? 
[01:07:00]  Come on.  That's an old Star Wars gag.  He gutted the camel in the middle of the desert and showed how you could crawl inside it to  keep warm when the temperature drops at night?  Would you ever do that?  No.  Because then you're just covered in wet animal entrails.  And then what?  You get up and have to leave and it freezes on you?  I don't know, but check it out on YouTube.  You don't have to watch the whole show anymore.  Man vs. Wild drinks camel poo juice.  Yeah, he did that as well.  Squeezed out the poo to get some liquid so he could survive a little dehydration. 
[01:07:30]  So even though they're saying he was exposed as a faker, look at this.  Yeah, he's exposed as a faker as he's got camel poo in his hand and he's squeezing it above  his head and swallowing the goodness that's coming out of it.  Would you do that?  I have.  Oh, good point.  It's disgusting.  All right.  What else made this list?  Wouldn't you throw up and not keep the juice down?  You would think, Jamie.  You would think. 
[01:08:00]  10 worst things that happened to men in 2007.  Crocs.  Those dumb shoes.  Ugh.  They're colorful with holes in them and I don't know.  I would never wear a croc.  Number five, Oscar De La Hoya in women's underwear.  That wasn't good for men in the year 2007 for some reason.  This is why Maxim is so predictable.  That was great for men because if Oscar can do it, we can all do it.  Number four is Boston sports dominance.  It wasn't good for men in general in 2007.  David Beckham comes to America. 
[01:08:30]  Who gives a crap?  What does that mean?  He's going to take our women?  Is that what Maxim's getting at?  David Beckham's going to take our women because now he's in America?  Yeah.  We should all be in fear of David Beckham?  Ugh.  Soccer stinks.  Number two, two girls, one cup.  Really?  Worst things that happened to men in 2007.  Worst thing?  Why have rallied guys together to get together and watch it and laugh?  Well, Maxim, they write, we like porn.  We like going number two. 
[01:09:00]  We even like watching porn while we go number two.  But we don't like porn that involves people going number two.  Sure, the reaction videos this clip has spawned are great,  but we never dreamed that the day internet porn went mainstream,  this would be its ambassador.  What a dopey list this is.  No one's looking at that as true porn.  They're looking at it as kind of freak crap.  Freak show stuff, right?  And could they have used, do they have to use the word number two?  Like, it's like a guy's magazine.  Why wouldn't you just use the word? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Like, you know, I can see it on the air, but a guy's magazine, use the word.  Yeah, and I didn't adjust that.  No, you didn't at all.  You read it as it was.  And then, number one, worst thing that happened to men in 2007, according to Maxim magazine,  men who dance.  If Jean-Claude Van Damme taught us anything, it's that men should never bust a move in public.  It's all kinds of awkward and will never get you, mmm.  Even worse, Dancing with the Stars has managed to convince world champion athletes to hit the floor.  Come on.  Floyd Mayweather, we want to see you bashing brains, not flitting to the foxtrot. 
[01:10:00]  And, number one, that list.  That was pretty funny, though.  Yeah, it was just funny.  Lists always blow.  Yeah.  They just, it's very rare you get a list that is actually funny, well-written, plingent.  Maybe on the show, before the end, we, as a show, could come up with a list. 
[01:10:30]  Well, the listeners can help us.  End of your list.  Our listeners and us will come up with a better list.  Absolutely.  We'll start that after the break.  877-212-ON-A.  We go to break with another Grammy Minute, Grammy Moment, whatever the hell we're calling them.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Record of the year.  What goes around, comes around.  Justin Timberlake.  It's breaking my heart to watch you run around.  Because I know that you're lying, I'm never lying. 
[01:11:00]  That's okay, baby.  Baby, baby, because in time you will find.  Around, goes around, goes around.  Turns all the way back around.  What goes around, goes around, goes around.  Turns all the way back around.  Yeah.  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:11:30]  We greatly appreciate it.  I want to thank all the people going to iTunes and downloading the O&A short.  It's number one as far as podcasts go.  Tell your friends about that.  It's very, very cool.  Finally getting mine up.  Yeah.  Oh, it's been, God, like weeks.  Yeah?  But, yeah, Laszlo.  The wonderful Laszlo has hosted my podcast.  And he said he was hanging out over the weekend with a little red wine. 
[01:12:00]  And he decided to add a few sound effects to it.  So, he helped out with a little of the sound production and did a great job.  So, the guys over there at Rockstar are compressing it to a reasonable size.  And then it'll be up probably later today.  I'll have a link and I'll put it up all over the place.  Your video podcast about protecting your home.  About home invasions.  Home invasions and the horrors of home invasion. 
[01:12:30]  Home invasions are a serious matter.  That's why your local law enforcement decided to put this video together.  Ooh!  Home security strategies with Anthony Cumia will instruct you on how to protect your loved ones  and, more importantly, your valuables.  This week's episode is...  Defending a single-point entry.  Your best defense is having a situation where they all have to come through one place. 
[01:13:00]  You ever see the 300?  If you've got a home invasion and they've got to come through a door or a window,  you've got to keep stuff secure enough where it's going to take them a little while to get in.  And then when you hear that commotion, grab your weaponry!  Take up a position.  That door flies open.  Yeah!  Bam!  They're all right in your sights.  We hope you've learned a lot from today's video.  For more information on home invasions or other videos, contact your local police department. 
[01:13:30]  There you go.  And turn me in.  Yeah.  Get some feedback.  We've got a guy.  Don't have his name, unfortunately.  Worst thing to happen to men in the year 2007?  Chris Hansen.  And earlier we were talking about football and we forgot to thank our fine friends at Dish Network.  They sponsor the football picks every week.  Time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today.  The football pool is just about done for this year. 
[01:14:00]  I think we're going to extend it through the playoffs, though.  And we're all going to pick a team out of a hat.  Yeah, that'll be cool, right?  Is that how we're going to do it?  Huh?  Is that how we're going to do it?  Yeah, I guess.  Out of a hat?  And they still won't care out there?  No.  I mean, they love Dish Network, but they don't really give a crap about our football picks.  We've tried everything this year.  Even having you pick it by, you know.  I know.  I tried a wacky method.  A wacky method. 
[01:14:30]  When do you pick again?  Why?  You want to pick this week?  Yes, I guarantee you I'll do well.  All right.  We'll pick in a couple days.  Okay.  You let me know.  Thursday?  I don't know.  The games start early this year.  This week, right?  I think they start with Thursday games again.  Well, Friday games, Saturday games, Sunday games.  I don't know.  Right?  Thumbs up from Travis?  Of course.  Hey, we got some fear-mongering ads that need to be on the air.  Danny found this.  Where's Danny?  Danny!  Where is he?  I don't know. 
[01:15:00]  The bars aren't open this early.  What's up, Danny?  What's going on?  What do we got in front of us here?  I don't know.  What are you playing?  The fear-mongering ads?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you and Milv doing something?  Yeah, these made me laugh this morning.  Some guy is trying to run for president, so, of course, with every campaign comes the trying  to scare the crap out of you, so vote for me ads.  Right, right.  And this is two of them.  Wait, this guy's running for president?  He's trying to get nominated for something.  Some kind of office? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, some kind of office.  All right.  And we got to hire him.  We got to elect him, or this stuff is going to happen.  Yeah, like gang violence is going to happen if we don't hire this guy?  Well, isn't gang violence happening?  He's, the ads have a recurring theme of how we have to protect the borders, and how we  can't allow the immigration laws to get out of control in this country like they have  been, so one of his points is how gangs have come in across the borders, and now it's  a big problem, so this wouldn't happen if you vote for me.  Let's hear it.  Hi, I'm Tom Tancredo, and I approve this message because someone needs to say it. 
[01:16:00]  Mothers killed, children executed.  The tactics of vicious Central American gangs now on U.S. soil.  Pushing drugs, raping kids, destroying lives.  Thanks to gutless politicians who refuse to defend our borders.  One man dares say what must be done.  Secure the borders, deport those who don't belong, make sure they never come back.  Wow, we need this guy. 
[01:16:30]  If you don't vote for Tom Tancredo, your kids are getting raped.  Yes.  That's a tough stance to take, though, because once you start, like, then kid rapists won't  vote for you.  Yeah, yeah, you're losing a lot of people, potential voters.  You're going to lose all the red dot houses.  And then there's one on terrorism?  Yeah, I don't know if this one is as shocking, I suppose, as the first one, but it ends pretty  apocalyptically.  Mm, nice.  Hi, I'm Tom Tancredo, and I approve this message because someone needs to say no. 
[01:17:00]  There are consequences to open borders beyond the 20 million aliens who've come to take  our jobs.  Islamic terrorists now freely roam U.S. soil.  Jihadists who froth with hate, here to do as they have in London, Spain, Russia.  The price we pay for spineless politicians who refuse to defend our borders against those  who come to kill.  Now, the visual on that one is a terror, well, an alleged terrorist. 
[01:17:30]  He's roaming around, like, a market with, like, a knapsack, and the end part is him  blowing up this morning.  If they don't show it, it just fades to black.  Yeah, I think you know what happened.  I mean, it's just short of, you know, mushroom cloud.  Right, right, right.  That old gag.  And apparently that ad was running, and it scared the crap out of, like, a five- or six-year-old,  you know, and they complained to their parents, and now the parents want it, you know, want  the ad off the air because it's scary for kids.  Where's this guy running? 
[01:18:00]  I'll have to find out.  Well, he ran already, I'm sure, right?  The elections are over.  He's probably running against Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  What happened to Paul R. Nelson?  Hey, where's he?  Selling houses somewhere.  Yeah.  There was an interesting story in the paper over the weekend.  20 million marriages are sexless.  Wow.  And they give you some reasons for why these marriages are sexless.  Do we have that list, Jimmy?  And basically, they're saying most men are just bored with their wives, and that's why 
[01:18:30]  they're not having sex with their wives.  Here's a couple of the lists.  One is she's not adventurous, 68%.  Adventurous.  She's not adventurous.  Meaning she doesn't like to bite the pillow.  That's what I'm thinking.  Another reason, she doesn't enjoy it, 61%, which means you're boring, and she doesn't know  how to tell you that, so she pretends she's sick.  I do with others, but not her, 48%.  48%.  48% of the guys that were surveyed for this? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Because this is 20 million marriages.  Yeah, 48% of the guys that answered said that they would do with others, but not her.  Probably because, again, when a woman becomes a mother, too, it's hard for a lot of guys  to bang their wives once it's a mother, because you'll look at her like she's the mother of  your kids.  It's hard to be.  Once it's a mother.  I mean, once she's a mother.  Yeah, I'm tired.  Yeah, I like that.  That's funny.  Another reason is I'm bored, 41%.  41% are bored.  And she gained weight, 38%.  And if you're bored in bed. 
[01:19:30]  I think it's higher than that.  I think so, too.  Could be higher than that.  But women have this thing where they think that if they just lay on their backs, you're  supposed to be ready to have sex with them.  There's like a weird thing there.  Women think you should be ready, whenever they're ready, you have to be ready, and  they don't want to work for it.  Right.  So I don't blame a lot of these guys for being bored after 10 years of that crap.  Technical difficulties, 30%.  I don't know what that means.  That's probably going to be a Viagra or something.  That's no good.  You need the pill.  Prefer online porn, 25%.  A woman really can't. 
[01:20:00]  Prefer online porn to the real woman that you are married to.  You'd rather look at sexy videos online and take care of yourself.  Well, if you're in a boring marriage and she's not doing anything and she has middle of  the road, occasional sex, why not cruise filth online?  Yeah.  I mean, I encourage you to do that.  Why not?  And then just like you say, yeah, you just take care of things.  There's no need for her to be involved.  Right.  Let her lay there with her stupid mullet.  Having an affair, 20%, which is pretty ballsy. 
[01:20:30]  Wait, but you already said that he's having sex with other people earlier.  Usually, these percentages don't end up to 100.  Oh, okay.  I do with others, but not hers, 48%.  But 20% were actually having an affair.  Okay.  So I guess they don't have any energy for her.  Yeah.  She'll wonder, what happened to you?  Did you drop a filet of fish sandwich in your lap?  And you'll be like, I don't want to talk about it.  Too tired, 14%.  Because, you know, men work and we get tired.  A lot of times women don't understand that.  But I think men are lying half the time. 
[01:21:00]  They're not tired.  No, it's very rare that you're too tired to have sex if you're a guy.  Believe me, you've got to be really tired.  Really tired.  Because if a girl reaches over and grabs hold, it's over.  All of a sudden, you're not that tired anymore.  Believe me, you can work.  That's what happens.  I don't buy that.  I've been too tired for sex, though, because we get up so early.  If I'm, like, going all day, I mean, literally, I don't want to have sex. 
[01:21:30]  I'm white.  Has she made a move on you and you go, so tired, really?  But I'm never too tired for someone's head to do all the work while I relax.  I'm never too tired.  And watch the big game, right, Jimmy?  You're such a giving lover.  I'm never too tired to put my hands behind my head and hear,  nighty night.  As you're eating a sandwich, watching the big game.  I'm never too tired for that.  But sometimes I'm too tired to work and chip in. 
[01:22:00]  Not interested in sex at all, only 3%.  And I'm gay, less than 1%.  1%.  I'm gay.  Ooh.  Someone actually wrote that down in the survey?  Yes, but less than 1% are gay.  Married guys.  I guess our own Steve took the survey, huh?  What's that?  Oh, it's a...  They showed a picture of John Travolta and it said, he's out.  What?  And I thought they meant, you know, out of the closet because there have been  allegations of... 
[01:22:30]  Well, I was showing you the picture of him kissing a guy today.  Yeah.  But...  Because he's getting onto his plane.  Apparently he's out...  On the lips.  Yeah.  He's out of the movie, Dallas.  Making a movie as...  Who the hell is he going to play?  Probably J.R., right?  Yeah, J.R.  He must have been playing J.R.  Yeah.  Why is he out?  He thought it was J.O.  They're putting in Ben Stiller.  That's what they said.  Which is... 
[01:23:00]  Is J.R.  Really?  I know.  What, is it going to be a wacky comedy, Dallas, now?  Or...  I don't know.  But when I saw a picture of him, we were talking about 1% of married men.  The reason they don't have sex is because they're gay.  And I look up and see John Travolta and it says he's out.  I thought maybe there was breaking news.  You got a bit confused there, right?  Yes, I did.  All right.  Confused.  Diana from California.  What's up?  Hey, in that tape of the politician, is that the thing voiceover guy that does, 
[01:23:30]  the cheater show?  Yeah, someone else said that.  Those ads use the narrator from cheaters.  Oh, yeah?  The fear-mongering ads we just played.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is crazy.  Huh?  I said it's crazy.  It totally sounds like that.  Why would that be crazy?  Because.  Why would he be doing a politician's show?  A politician's ad?  Someone has to.  I guess so.  You're making it sound like, you know, these political ads are really important  and she's acting like Obama did a commercial for Hillary. 
[01:24:00]  It's madness.  It's crazy, everybody.  He did it for some money.  And if you want to see a tired picture.  All right.  We're done with you.  Thank you.  Diana.  California.  If you want to see a tired picture of Hillary Clinton, go to Drudge today.  Yeah.  They say the campaign trail is really kind of wearing on her.  Is she walking everywhere?  She looks horrendous.  Look at her.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I'm sure they had some better pictures of her, but they picked the worst  She's got a lot of makeup on and picture they take the worst one and throw it up there. 
[01:24:30]  Good.  And then says the toll of a campaign.  It's a picture of her soul.  It's old and ugly.  She doesn't have a chance at this point, right?  She's got Bill Schilling for her going all over saying that Obama isn't qualified to be  president and she's such a nice person and she's the best candidate.  He got really sarcastic.  If we could get yesterday's paper, there was a lot of great Bill Clinton quotes because  he's sticking up for his wife and trying to beat up Obama a little bit. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  And some of the stuff he was saying was pretty funny.  We got to get it.  There was like four or five of them.  He just went off on them.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Basically saying he's not qualified and all sorts of stuff.  I just think he really does want her to be president just for the fact that it would  free him up completely now.  Like the second this is over, if she's not president, they go back to, no, I think they  just go back to Chappaqua.  You think they're real?  Nah, man.  And she goes back to doing what she does. 
[01:25:30]  He goes back to doing what he does.  But she's still like over him, you know?  She's still got it over him and she's there now.  If she's in the White House, Bill could do whatever the hell he wants.  She's got to be the president.  I think they stayed married so she could have a chance at the White House.  And as soon as that dream's over, they're done.  Yeah, but you don't think in four years she's still thinking about it?  I don't think she wants to screw that up.  She's going to try in another four years?  This is it for her. 
[01:26:00]  It's been known to happen over and over again.  This is it for her.  I don't know.  She has a strong showing.  She's not old to the point where she couldn't do it again.  This is one shot for her, I think.  If she has a strong showing.  She's been building to this point for a long time.  This is it for her.  But don't forget, she wasn't an elected official for a long time.  And then she's been in New York for a while.  So now people see her as a presidential candidate.  If she has a good campaign, she absolutely could run again in four years.  Get a little more experience under her belt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little more experience under her belt, of course. 
[01:26:30]  Hmm.  What's that?  Belt.  I was hoping the phones were...  Yeah.  We know what's under there now.  Certainly do.  A big one.  I was hoping the phones were going to ring as far as that sex survey went.  We should spend a little more time on that.  Yeah.  I guess guys are like that.  That's true.  Bill Clinton came out guns a-blazing in an interview with Charlie Rose taped Thursday that aired Friday night.  Some of the things he said on Obama's lack of experience.  Obama supporters say they want someone who started running for president a year after he became a senator.  And we're willing to risk it. 
[01:27:00]  He said on the media, the Obama people got the press on their side.  On Obama, I get tickled watching him.  These are all sarcastic tones in his voice when he was saying this stuff.  On Obama playing down the experience issue, that's like saying that because 100% of medical malpractice is committed by doctors,  the next time I need surgery, I'll get a chef or plumber to do it.  And on Iowa, it's a miracle Hillary's got a chance to win. 
[01:27:30]  He's cracking wise.  He's cracking a bit wise.  Yes, Anthony.  Why do people care about Iowa?  I've had enough of the Iowa caucus.  The caucus.  I'm sick of Iowa.  They just want Iowa to feel good, like you finally matter.  We let you vote.  What does it mean, Iowa?  Yeah.  Can one of you Iowans call and explain what your dumb state is talking about ever?  Yeah, how did Iowa get so much power?  It's ridiculous.  It has to go back to something that happened back in the day when they used to talk in the back of trains and stuff. 
[01:28:00]  Way back when?  Way back when.  Radar O'Reilly is from Iowa.  That's the only good thing of Iowa.  Good.  That old mangled hand.  Yeah, old damaged fingers holding a clipboard and hiding them.  Yeah, why do we give Iowa so much power?  Iowa sucks.  We don't even know anything about Iowa.  Nope.  Name a state that even, like, borders Iowa.  Wyoming.  Kansas.  I'm going to go with Chicago.  The state of Chicago. 
[01:28:30]  Which isn't even a state.  That's the bit.  I don't know.  We need to know more about Iowa today.  Iowa.  Nebraska.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Are you sure about that?  Nebraska fan?  Could you name all 50 states right now if you had to?  It would take me a long time.  No, I'm serious, though.  Oh, yeah?  Nebraska does border it?  Yep.  What about Illinois?  Yes.  Yeah!  Oh, man, that I pulled that one out of my you-know-what. 
[01:29:00]  I can name them unalphabetically.  Oh.  Really?  Starting with?  How long would it take you?  Probably less than two minutes.  He's so...  He's such a liar.  I love when Jimmy lies.  Give me the state.  Because he sets it up.  He's like, probably about two minutes.  He's acting.  No.  I like acting, Jimmy.  Obviously, we all could name all 50 states.  But how long would it take?  Because you would have to start, like...  You'd have to...  I would go, like, A, all right. 
[01:29:30]  Alaska, Alabama.  And then I have to keep going and thinking of all of them.  Yeah.  Jimmy, why don't you set the record, and then we'll...  Arizona.  Florida.  Oh, wait.  I didn't see.  Burbank.  Wait, I need a...  I need a print out of that if Jimmy's going to do it, because I've got to check him off.  I can't do it alphabetically.  No, no, no.  But I'm very quick.  But it's the only way to do it, really, is alphabetically.  I'll think of the math.  In high school, I was nominated Boy Most Likely to Name States Quickly.  Ooh.  Yes.  Wow, congrats. 
[01:30:00]  How long do you think Voss would take?  He'd take...  I'd say Voss would take the whole show to name the ones that border New York.  And he's worked at all of them.  He's so stupid.  Would you...  Like, yeah, there's two ways to do it.  Alphabetically, or look at the country in your head as a map, and then run yourself from  the west to east, or look to south.  That's how I would do it.  But then the Midwest would mess me up.  Would it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There's some weird-looking states.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Tennessee.  I'd get Tennessee.  You'd get Tennessee?  Yeah, that's a thing.  Missouri.  Missouri.  I might leave that one out.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Jimmy, you want to set the...  I can't set the bar.  Well, no, you're going to set the bar.  Okay.  All right, ready?  Whenever you're...  This isn't going to work.  No, of course not.  I can see your face.  I'm ready to go.  All right, go.  All right, Vermont, Maine, New York.  Whoa, where's Vermont?  Well, that's not going to help.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:31:00]  This is really going to be bad.  You can't find it on an alphabetical list.  You know what you need?  You need a map.  You need a map with the names in the map, and that way you can cross it off.  All right, start over.  Because then you know where to look if you know where the states are.  All right, start over.  All right.  Whenever you're ready.  All right.  All right, go.  Vermont.  All right.  Maine.  Connecticut.  New York.  I see your strategy.  Pennsylvania.  Sucks.  New Jersey.  You left one behind.  I certainly did not. 
[01:31:30]  I did not leave any behind.  Yes, you did.  No, I didn't.  You're already in Pennsylvania.  Texas.  I'm going all over.  Texas.  You went too south of me.  Florida.  You're never going to get it this way.  This is a horrible strategy.  Georgia.  He's going to end up with 10.  Tennessee.  Alabama.  Arkansas.  Did I say Pennsylvania yet?  Yes.  Okay, Illinois.  Michigan.  Wait.  All right, go ahead, go ahead.  Wyoming.  Uh-huh.  North Dakota.  South Dakota. 
[01:32:00]  Nebraska.  Nevada.  Washington, California.  Hawaii and Alaska.  And I said Maine and Vermont.  New Hampshire.  That's the one you forgot.  I know.  Iowa.  I didn't forget.  I just wanted to go buy it because I don't like it.  Iowa.  Yeah.  Oh, there's plenty more.  I mean, I'm not.  Jesus.  Colorado.  Colorado.  Colorado's one.  Yeah.  I already said California. 
[01:32:30]  I already said Washington State.  Mm-hmm.  I said Mississippi.  Mississippi, I didn't say.  Okay.  They were up to what the country was in like 1830.  Minnesota.  Minnesota.  Ohio.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, hold on now.  I didn't say I could do them quickly.  I did Pennsylvania.  I was thinking of Pittsburgh.  That's not a state.  Ohio.  I did Colorado already.  I'm just going over cities now that I have gigs coming up in North Fork Theater, New 
[01:33:00]  Year's Eve, Long Island, Borgata, January 20th, but that's New Jersey.  Oh.  Oh, there's North Carolina, South Carolina.  Mm-hmm.  How many do I have so far?  Not a lot.  I do have a lot.  You kidding?  I got like 40.  About half.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  About half.  All right.  Name one I forgot.  Well, Jesus.  Well, name one.  Okay.  How about Massachusetts?  South Dakota.  I didn't forget.  I said North Dakota, South Dakota.  You didn't do Massachusetts. 
[01:33:30]  Of course I did.  Montana.  I didn't say Montana, but I wasn't there yet.  You're rushing me.  I hop over states and go back.  I use the method like I do the jump method where I jump a couple states and I yell, king  me, and I come back up.  You're horrid.  I already did Texas, didn't I?  Yeah, you did Texas.  It's a hard thing to do.  What's hard about it?  I'm laughing at this.  Arizona, okay.  You want to stay capitals?  I'll give you them someday.  All right.  You get the point.  It's a pain in the ass to try to get them off.  No, it's awful.  Every nerd in the country is calling, I can do them backwards.  I can do it in 30 seconds. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  We'll take a break and we'll get into other things.  It'll be a big surprise for everybody coming off after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're getting very excited.  We got John C. Reilly coming in today.  Yeah, big staff.  He's going to stop by for a quick visit, talk about his new movie, Walk Hard.  I think Roland's talking to him right now.  Roland, are you talking to him? 
[01:34:30]  What?  Yeah.  What?  What?  He just arrived.  He just arrived.  Very good.  We'll get him in here in a few minutes.  Talking about Walk Hard.  We saw the movie.  It's pretty good, man.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really well written.  Except for the, uh, you know.  What?  Except for the, uh.  Oh.  You know.  The nude man.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you're just trying to enjoy a fine movie, and next thing you know, you're 
[01:35:00]  violated by you-know-what-in-your-face.  Oops.  Oh, yeah.  Yuck.  I didn't know.  What?  Right.  It was.  But at least he brought back the topless broads.  Yes.  That's what I say, uh, movies need.  When we were growing up, every movie had topless broad in it.  Didn't matter what the subject matter was.  And then, like, you know, because we live in these politically correct times, I guess  that's a no-no.  But some of the films finally bringing that back. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  You used to watch-  Gratuitous nudity.  We should talk about that someday.  There were movies that just had a girl topless for no reason.  It had nothing to do with the movie, the storyline.  But they just knew guys wanted to see that when they were sitting in a movie theater.  And then it went away.  Just run around the scene with her top off.  Yeah.  That's why I hated Knocked Up.  Because, uh, that broad was, uh, you know, she didn't want to get topless in the movie.  Drove me nuts that she wasn't topless in a movie called Knocked Up.  They gotta have the, uh, the stunt boobs, you know? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Where they kind of pan up and down the body but don't show the face.  And then-  Yeah.  And you see the face and-  Oh, Katherine Hagel, yeah.  From, uh, Grey's Anatomy.  She would not get topless in Knocked Up.  And that drove me nuts that she didn't get, uh, topless.  And then she, uh-  Damn scruples.  She said recently that that's a guy's movie and she kind of was sort of, sort of trashing  Knocked Up.  Did you get that quote?  It's like, oh, well, it did-  It did well by you.  Made you a movie star.  Made you a lot of money. 
[01:36:30]  And now she's coming out saying, you know, it was a guy's movie.  Made women look stupid in the movie.  And I don't know.  Yeah, because movies never make guys look stupid.  Every stupid-  Everything on television makes guys look retarded.  Every commercial-  Oh, dad can't do it.  Shut up.  Dad's an idiot.  Dad's a bumbling idiot.  Just sitting there in his own feces.  He can't fix the VCR.  And mom's zipping around the house, carrying a baby, bringing home the-  We get it.  We get it.  You're better than we are.  Let's go to Ian in New York.  Ian.  Hey, what's up, Ian? 
[01:37:00]  What's up, Ian?  Hi, Ian.  How are you?  I'm okay.  Yeah, what's up?  It worked, so you tell me.  So, you-  All right, you guys are killing me with trying to say these states.  Why?  It's-  It's-  This is something I learned in grade school, okay?  I thought everybody learned it, but apparently not.  So, if you don't mind, I'll say them.  I'll probably say them in, I don't know, 30 or 40 seconds.  Is this necessary?  I do mind, because we're-  You think we're-  You're dealing with dummies?  You got the list right in front of you.  No, I don't have the list.  Even if you don't. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, even if you don't.  We don't care.  Who cares?  You know that whole naming of the states thing was just a goof.  Yeah.  What do you think this is, a morning zoo?  How long do you think it would take you to name them all?  I don't care.  40 seconds.  I don't care.  40 seconds and they're written down in front of you?  No, they're not.  Shouldn't it be faster than that?  Dude, who's buying that?  You don't have it up on your computer screen right now.  What order would you do them in?  Alphabet.  I could care less. 
[01:38:00]  All right, go ahead.  Alphabetically.  Let's hear you name all 50 states.  This is Ian from New York.  Wants to show us up today.  Go ahead, Ian.  Alabama, Alaska.  There you go.  I'm disappointed that he actually got part of Alaska.  Yeah, I know.  What happened?  What?  Oh, Catherine Hagel recently told Vanity Fair that Knocked Up is a little sexist.  It paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight,  and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys.  I had a hard time with it on some days.  I'm playing such a bitch.  Well, you sound fun in your interview. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  What's the problem?  You know, that movie made her a movie star.  Shut up and cash your check.  We were going to do the five most liked Christmas songs  and the five most disliked songs,  but then I'm finding out it was a survey where they surveyed women.  So that's not going to do us any good today.  No.  Enough about the list.  Huh?  The end of year list?  There's some good ones, though.  The end of year list.  The boys found a good one.  The worst band names of the year. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's a good one?  I don't have it in front of me right now, but yeah, that's a good one.  I don't like that.  I just got kind of tired of the end of year lists.  Like, lately, it's just everything's got an end of year list.  It's that time of year.  About everything.  Yeah, but when you hear the number one, you're like, oh, wow.  No.  Like, top movie of 2007.  No.  Let's see.  Go ahead.  Top movie of 2007, Ant.  Top movie 2007, 300. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, that's number seven.  Oh.  Well, now I am interested.  Every movie name would be one that you've pretty much saw.  You've seen.  I know.  There's going to be no surprise.  The Simpsons movie was eight.  Pirates of the Caribbean was four.  Harry Potter was five.  Transformers three.  Shrek the third two.  And this is where you go, oh, wow.  Here it is.  Oh, wow.  Here it is.  He's going to say number one.  Spider-Man 3, number one movie of 2007. 
[01:40:00]  I should have known.  Oh, wow, right?  No?  No.  How about the top ten DVDs of 2007?  Oh, the same things?  Huh?  The same movies?  No.  Well, they don't play fair with DVDs.  No.  They only do, like, quote, unquote, like, traditional films.  Oh, right.  Not at the museum for 300.  Dirt was three.  Transformers DVD two.  Happy Feet, number one.  So, that right there you go, oh, wow.  Wow.  I tried to sit through that. 
[01:40:30]  What?  Happy Feet?  Yeah.  It's like, what is this about?  Who cares?  It's about, what, penguins?  Yeah.  Penguins, dancing penguins, I think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he had Happy Feet.  Somehow that saved all the penguins.  All right.  How about this one?  How about...  I didn't watch the whole thing.  I was on a cruise ship at the time, and gambling and drinking were first and foremost in my mind.  How about the top tour of 2007?  Top tour?  Rolling Stones.  No.  They're always the top tour. 
[01:41:00]  The Dewey Cox band?  Very good.  From Walk Hard.  The Police was number one.  Genesis, number two.  Justin Timberlake, number three.  And the rest, who cares?  Top website of 2007, Ant.  Top website.  Oh, gee.  Huh?  Lemonparty.org.  Top website?  Yeah.  Google.  Of course.  The Google.  Followed by?  The Yahoo. 
[01:41:30]  The Yahoo is right.  Followed by The Drudge.  And then after that, it doesn't matter.  It's all MSN, Windows Live, Microsoft, AOL, Fox, eBay, YouTube, Wikipedia, Apple.  Number one game?  Call of Duty 4.  No.  Guitar Hero.  No.  Is it on the list?  No.  I could have just kept blurting out games.  Top 10 CDs of 2007.  Ah.  How about that one? 
[01:42:00]  Paul McCartney.  Paul McCartney?  That stupid one that he has.  No.  Awful.  That plinking.  That plinking ukulele.  Or whatever the hell he's playing.  We'll go with Josh Groban.  Number 10.  Acon.  Nickelback.  Kane West.  I always say Kane.  Kanye West.  Kane West.  I always say Kane.  Doesn't the Y3 off in there?  Yeah.  I don't know what's going on with that.  Every time I see it, I know it's Kanye, but I have to say Kane.  Kanye. 
[01:42:30]  Six is the Eagles' long road out of Eden.  They came back with a new album this year.  Fergie, No.  5.  Hannah Montana soundtrack.  No.  4.  Linkin Park.  Linkin Park.  Wow.  One of the top CDs of 2007.  Nice.  No.  3.  Daughtry, No.  2.  And then that dumb High School Musical 2 soundtrack is No.  1.  The girls love that thing.  These lists stink.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  All right.  How about top pop song of 2007?  Up, up.  Fergie.  Is it Fergie's song? 
[01:43:00]  How do you know that?  I just know.  Every time I hear a top pop song, I say Fergie.  And it works sometimes?  Did it work?  Big Girls Don't Cry.  Yeah.  Do we know that song?  Yeah.  You do?  I hear it in the truck.  Oh, this thing?  Yeah.  This is Fergie?  When I'm alone in the truck.  I've never gotten past three lines of this.  I listen to this and I cry.  It's like Christmas Shoes to you?  Yes.  It's on my iPod, yes. 
[01:43:30]  Bastards.  That's the number one song of 2007.  Nelly Furtado is...  Ah, whatever.  Who cares?  You're right.  You're right.  Is Daughtry on there?  Huh?  Is Daughtry on there?  As...  I don't know.  I just ripped up the list.  Ah, right?  For what?  Top pop song?  Yeah.  Don't even bother putting it together.  I don't care.  Look, but I ripped it up perfectly where I got the list right there.  I'm one of the least squares.  Number seven.  It's not over or whatever.  Let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  Steve. 
[01:44:00]  How'd you guys not spend the entire week on the why guys don't have sex with their line,  with their wives thing?  Yeah, I know.  We want to get into that a little bit.  I don't think we spent enough time on it.  Nobody called in.  No one called in because everyone was scared.  Well, unless wives are listening to this, I don't think so.  Well, you got to start telling stories, though.  We got to get our listeners in there.  So you got to kind of tell a story about, you know.  The line porn has got to be a bigger reason, but guys aren't allowed to go on.  The easiest way to hide that is to tell your wife that you're checking your fantasy football 
[01:44:30]  until two o'clock at the morning.  Is your wife computer savvy?  Sure, sure.  So you got to...  Now, hold on.  So you have to make sure you're clearing up your history and everything like that.  Well, you know what you do is you put it into a search engine and you click it off there  so it doesn't go into the web browser.  Yeah.  Just reset it.  I'm giving every woman a reason to check this stuff now.  When are they going to come out with, like, throwaway computers? 
[01:45:00]  Disposable computers.  Disposable computers.  You use them once and throw them away.  They haven't.  They're called Dell.  You got to have, like, a thing where you just pull a string on the back, like a grenade  pin.  Right.  And a big piece of primer cord just fries your hard drive.  I was thinking more shukka, shukka, shukka, shukka.  Oh, like an Etch-A-Sketch?  Yeah, yeah.  You shake your hard drive upside down and all the stuff falls off into powder.  Just shukka, shukka, shukka.  Yeah, and then you just sweep up the dirtiness that is what you were looking at and put it 
[01:45:30]  in the wastebasket.  I have 10 paperweights around my house, a whole hard drive.  The worst is when you start to type something in and all the dirty websites that you've  ever visited start to come up as the memory.  Yeah.  It's like, hey, that sounds like you're trying to get here.  I'll help you out a little bit.  I think there's a market for disposable computers or the shukka, shukka technology.  The shukka, shukka.  I'm going to go with the shukka, shukka technology.  It's so embarrassing at my house when I try to type in horse garage. 
[01:46:00]  What do you got, Stan?  My computer refused to stop filling in a certain site when I was living with my girlfriend.  Really?  Like, yeah.  What?  Namo.com?  No.  Like you'd start typing in an address and it would finish the address.  Yeah, I'd clear the history.  I'd even set it to don't guess the address when you're typing an address.  And for some reason, my computer really liked the site.  What was the site?  It was some girl's name, I think.  Oh.  And you were stalking?  No, I was like an amateur porn girl. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, of course.  Someone that fan-assed out when she said, no, he killed her.  I'm trying to think of my own experiences.  I like giving those to the listeners so they could jump on it and laugh at me.  And maybe get into the whole thing of the sex and marriage thing.  Because as you know, I was married for a while, Opie.  I almost forgot.  Yes.  Almost.  Almost.  And, um... 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, when did the sex go bad?  I know things were kind of, uh, kind of, you know, iffy.  Um, she would want to have these romantic evenings.  Candle night.  Candle night.  For the people that linger along.  But it wasn't a scheduled thing.  I would just pull up with Opie when me and Opie used to carpool together when we lived  in Huntington.  And, uh, Opie would be driving me home.  And, uh, we'd be driving down my street.  And I'd look at the house and notice, uh-oh, the lights are off.  And I see, like, candlelight flickering inside. 
[01:47:30]  And I knew that was, like, there was an attempt being made at romance.  And the pot roast would be in the oven waiting for you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was being cooked.  There was a tall, icy cold tumbler full of, uh, Captain Morgan and Coke.  Some of those fingerling potatoes roasting.  Why are they called fingerling potatoes?  Like, it was, uh, you know, it was something that a lot of guys would be like, wow, this  is great.  I'm gonna have a nice meal. 
[01:48:00]  You get home to suburbia.  Some beers and some sex with a wife.  Your wife is there with candlelights.  Dinner's ready and a little, uh, a little, uh, effing around when, when everything's  done.  Sure.  Uh, I needed to hit the next level of Half-Life.  It's very, uh, these headcrabs were a bitch.  Couldn't get past the level.  And, um.  So you walk in the house.  I walk in the house and my eyes immediately darted to the left at the computer monitor.  Like, oh, how am I gonna try to say I want to play this game right now? 
[01:48:30]  Wait, your computer's to the left and she's to the right in some lingerie with the lighting  down a little bit low?  Yeah, yeah.  It was something like that.  Yeah.  She's backlit nice.  And the, uh.  With the candlelight?  There was a candlelight and there was like a TV tray set up in front of the couch with,  uh, you know, just show what maybe I wanted to watch was on or something like that.  And, uh, dinner was on there and, uh, like I said, nice big glass of Captain Morgan and  Coke, so. 
[01:49:00]  She read this in some girly manner.  That's what I was, I was thinking.  A little fire going.  It's set up a little too perfectly, I think.  A little fire going in the fireplace that later in life, uh, ended up all my radio awards  and clothing being thrown into.  Has it burnt?  The, the, the, the chimney looked like the stacks at Auschwitz.  That's just my clothing burning.  She's burning your radio career memorabilia.  Everything I've ever earned in radio went up in smoke. 
[01:49:30]  The fireplace.  Oh, yes.  The fireplace that used to be lit for romance night.  Had the smell of plastic for the rest of the neighborhood.  I think, uh, uh, the sex thing just wasn't there for me anymore because I just wasn't,  uh, I wasn't into her.  It was like, uh, you know, I just wasn't, uh, it wasn't there.  Well, women don't understand that candles are not sexy to anybody but them.  Fires aren't sexy.  It's just cornball, harlequin romance.  I do like a good fire in a fireplace. 
[01:50:00]  I do like a little, yeah.  And I like a little candle burning.  The candles, I, I, I, I'm not a big candle guy.  I'm always worried that it's going to fall over and start a fire.  Dim the lights and put on a hooker skirt and some shiny hooker lipstick and just pretend  to be a whore.  That's sexy.  For real.  That's, that turns me on.  With no candles.  I don't care if you have, if you have like, uh, an, an airplane's headlights in the room  shining on yourself.  I don't need candles.  I'm not Dracula. 
[01:50:30]  I have a feeling you went the other way with that candle thing.  Yeah.  No, I, I, I was never into candles.  A fireplace is good.  Not even that it's adding to the mood really.  It kind of does, but, uh, I don't know.  It's just, it's, it's kind of good to have around.  What about music?  Are you into music or are you just into, uh, a little music action?  Some tool is nice.  Really?  You like, you like having sex to tool?  We're taps after I fail sexually. 
[01:51:00]  Apologize.  You know, we're finally onto something.  It's a tap staff.  Might as well play the music.  We're finally onto something, but we have to take a break because we've got a big star waiting  to come in.  And we're really got a show on this.  Great.  On this side.  Yeah.  John C.  Reilly from, uh, walk hard is coming in in a few minutes.  And Jimmy and I saw the movie and fans saw the movie and Sam saw the movie.  And did you see the movie, Iraq?  Why couldn't you?  Why?  Why?  Are you going to tell them that?  Why you couldn't?  Yeah.  What's the matter with you?  We were all invited.  Why didn't you see walk hard?  I had to work. 
[01:51:30]  What?  Work doing what?  We worked together.  The whole staff went.  That was the beauty of this job.  That's going to see a movie of a star you're going to interview is considered part of the  job.  That was part of work.  Didn't have time.  What were you doing that was so busy besides not exercise?  Getting vacation stuff done.  Oh, all right.  You don't have to yell at us.  Jesus.  Way to humiliate us.  All right.  I hope you and Anthony.  I've had to struggle every day my whole life through. 
[01:52:00]  Seem a share of the worst that this world can give.  But I still got a dream and a burning rage to live.  Walk hard.  Hard.  When they say you're all done.  Walk bold.  Hard.  Well, they say you're not the one. 
[01:52:30]  Even if you've been told time and time again that you're always going to lose and you're  never going to win.  You've got to keep that vision in your mind's eye when you're standing on top of a mountain  high.  Damn, that's good right there.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  In studio, John C. Reilly from Walk Hard and, of course, a song from the film right there  that we're checking out. 
[01:53:00]  Good morning.  Oh, wait.  Got the wrong mic on, I think.  Can you hear me now?  There you go.  John C. Reilly.  There he is.  It was Opie's fault.  Did I read at the end of the movie correctly that this was co-written by you and Marshall  Crenshaw, or am I wrong?  Yeah.  Well, me, Judd Apatow, Jake Kasdan, and Marshall Crenshaw, but mostly it was Marshall.  It was his song.  We just retrofitted some of the lyrics for the comedy of it all, and so, yeah, and Jake  and Judd came out with the title of the song and the basic concept, but yeah, we got nominated 
[01:53:30]  for a Golden Globe the other day.  All right.  Nice.  The four of us, yeah, for best song.  Very cool.  And my performance got nominated, too.  Were you always a good singer growing up and stuff, or is this something new?  No, I've been singing my whole life, yeah, since I was about eight or nine, and then I've  had different bands over the years.  I lived in New York.  I left Chicago in the late 80s, early 90s, moved to New York and had a couple bands here.  One of them was called Frozen Spit.  You may have heard of them.  Maybe not.  I don't know. 
[01:54:00]  Trudging around New York, just trying to get gigs somewhere.  Yeah, on a day like today, I'm reminded of the name of that band, too, because...  Yeah, it's a bit cold here in New York today.  Your spit actually does freeze before it hits the ground.  One of my favorite scenes in Boogie Nights is when you're screaming at the magic on those  tapes.  That's right.  You might own the physical tapes themselves, but the heart and soul and the blood and sweat  and tears.  But that was so great that you guys are sitting there working that tune out, and you're like,  you got the touch, and you're like, yeah, it's just great. 
[01:54:30]  It was just this horrendous song, and you're a...  Yeah, well, you got the touch.  I think it was a Night Ranger song?  Yeah.  And then I actually wrote a song for that movie, too, called Feel the Heat, which is a...  Kick ass.  A legendary song, yeah.  I wrote the music, and Paul Anderson wrote the words.  Knowing that you sing, and of course, Mark Wahlberg sings, it must have been difficult to be so bad.  Because I know if you can sing, it's hard to sing badly on cue when they tell you to. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Well, it wasn't that hard for Mark at that time, actually.  I think that was one of the reasons that he didn't get in the New Kids on the Block.  No, I'm sorry.  What was the name of the group that his brother was in?  No, no.  I almost said New Kids.  Yeah, that was New Kids.  Yeah, New Kids.  It was New Kids on the Block.  Yeah.  He just confused us by giving the right answer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, wait.  We're all sitting here waiting for it.  What was the name of the band?  They wanted him to take voice lessons and work on his voice, and he wasn't interested.  He wanted to be a rapper or a dancer or whatever.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  But yeah, he used to treat us to like, he used to take those microphones.  He used to make set announcements and launch into improvised versions of the different songs  to the pain of everyone around him.  What was the question?  It doesn't even matter anymore.  And I was saying, it must have been tough to sing so badly, because I know if you sing  and you listen to somebody, that's really off-key.  I was trying to sing the best I could in Boogie Nights. 
[01:56:00]  I wasn't trying to, I mean, the song is kind of dorky, but we were trying to sing it right  if we could.  When you got that movie, Boogie Nights, did you think, were you a little leery, like,  is this going to be porno, or is it bordering on it?  No, I'm really close friends with Paul Anderson, who wrote it and directed it, so I totally  got what he was after.  Actually, the movie, I mean, for all of its scandalous reputation, it's kind of a family  movie.  It's a movie about a family.  Yeah.  You know, like this weird, dysfunctional porno family, but it is like a father and a mother, 
[01:56:30]  and you know, like, anyway.  No, I knew it wasn't going to be too raw, just because, you know, we couldn't have it  be rated X, or whatever, the studio expected a certain kind of movie.  Well, that's what it was.  A lot of people went in with the misconception that it was going to be some kind of a porno  movie, and it's just turned out to be like a cult favorite, too.  I mean, you cannot not watch it.  There's some pretty hot scenes in that movie, though.  Hell yeah.  Between Julianne Moore and Mark, it's a pretty hot scene. 
[01:57:00]  That's a good one, and then Roller Girl has some great scenes where she just throws  her clothes off and jumps in the bed, and some good scenes.  I remember when we were shooting that scene, and just thinking, like, how on earth did  I get so lucky?  I'm standing here right now.  Heather Graham, naked.  Did you guys fight at the end of the movie as to who got to keep, like, Dirk Diggler's  prosthetic?  I don't want that to my own self.  You know, you'll have to have Mark in here one day to talk about that, because he claims  there was no prosthetic involved. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, wow.  You know, that's up to the viewer to decide.  Speaking of nudity, I mean, here's the fine segue into Walk Hard.  I love the movie.  We saw it, I think, last week, and didn't love the naked guy thing, though.  Yeah, but don't get me wrong about that.  What was that about?  What was that about?  And you didn't even warn us.  Seven seconds of the movie, and you guys are like, that's all you remember.  You're scarring for life.  We're kind of crossing boundaries here, you know?  But you have people crazy these days.  You've got to throw a couple, you know, sausage and beans in there. 
[01:58:00]  But it's just all of a sudden, I think you're on the phone, and all of a sudden, this thing  comes into frame.  But come on, it could be a lot worse.  It could be, you know...  Actually, it got a huge laugh at the screening we went to, because you just weren't expecting  to see that at that moment.  It got a huge laugh.  That answers the question why it had to be in there, because it got a huge laugh.  At least it wasn't inflated, you know what I mean?  Right, right.  It could have been worse.  It could have been glistening and menacing.  You know, did you guys have to, like, line up a bunch of models and, like, study this 
[01:58:30]  and decide on the perfect one or something?  Because it wasn't, uh, it wasn't, uh...  It was tiny.  Yeah, that's what I was getting at.  It was tiny.  It wasn't too big.  It was just kind of there.  You know, like...  You didn't want to insult anyone, I guess.  The guy, Tyler, told me, you know, I'm a grower, not a shower.  Right, right.  So, I think a lot of guys can relate to that.  That's his excuse, right?  You know, if you're not in that, uh, you know, ready-to-go phase, uh, things are not  so impressive visually to look at. 
[01:59:00]  No, the whole point was, like, my character tries marijuana, like, the scene before this  in the movie, and, uh, I'm on tour for the first time with my rock-and-roll band, and  I become so debauched, like, in 24 hours that a whole orgy in my hotel room, guys and girls,  it doesn't even phase me, and, like, the joke of it is not that, you know, it's some  sexual situation, it's just he comes up to me and he's like, hey, you want some eggs  or some coffee?  I'm like, what time does the bus leave, and I'm on the phone with my wife, and this guy's 
[01:59:30]  joint is right in front of my face.  That's the point, like, that I've become, you know, so depraved that I don't even notice  that there's a naked dude standing there.  It was a funny scene, and, uh, we thank you for bringing back, uh, The Topless Girl to a  movie.  Did we bring that back?  Has it been away for some time?  Has it been away in comedy?  Especially in comedy, you don't see a lot of topless scenes anymore.  We were saying when we grew up, every movie had the topless girl in the movie.  We've got quite a few.  And it went away for a while, and you obviously brought it back. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  You know, little things, I'm getting out there so that people go see, you know, walk hard.  Yeah, and, you know, speaking of...  The Dewey Cox story, by the way.  She doesn't get topless in the movie, but, you know, fans of The Office might not recognize  old Jenna Fisher.  She looked really hot.  In her movie, yeah.  She looked really sexy.  She's dolled up and ready to go.  It's a really dark comedy.  It's got some really dark humor, which is kind of nice, because typically they just put  out these soft, um, mom-and-pop adorable, and the opening, one of the opening scenes,  I'm not going to give away the movie, but let's just say that, uh, there's two kids. 
[02:00:30]  One is Dewey Cox and his little brother, and the little brother is saying things like,  God, things are looking so up, like, I'm going to have such a great long life, and you're  like, oh, something awful is about to happen to this child.  And it was such a great way of pulling it off, because it was every stupid cliche in  every movie, and here they are, giving it to you, and you're like, oh, he's got to die.  So there's a lot of dark stuff in the movie.  That was the point of the whole movie, was to have some fun with all these conventions  that you see over and over in these musical biopics, you know, like Ray walking on, or 
[02:01:00]  Great Balls of Fire, or La Bamba, or whatever it might be.  Like, all these movies traffic in these same kind of seminal events, and like, you take  a guy like Ray Charles and a guy like Johnny Cash, how could they possibly have such similar  lives, but when you compress them into 90 minutes, it kind of boils down that way.  So yeah, we decided to just have a goof on some of these things that audiences are really  familiar with in musical biopics, but at the same time, like, we wrote a lot of original  music for it, and I think we recorded like 40 original songs, and now I'm on tour with 
[02:01:30]  the band supporting it.  Speaking of the original music, Roland, he gave me the CD.  I forgot the name, is it called Walk Hard?  Walk Hard to do a cock story, yeah.  But the CD is called that as well?  Yeah, it's the soundtrack, yeah.  And I'm going to be honest with you, I just kind of threw it to the side, I'm like, I don't  want to hear, like, you know, like songs from a movie.  And then I saw the movie, and went, where's that CD?  I had to go find it, and I've been playing it, it's awesome.  Oh, thanks, yeah.  I mean, you've got some really catchy songs that you guys wrote for this movie. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, we started with Marshall Crenshaw, like you mentioned, who wrote the title track  with us, and then we've got Dan Byrne and Mike Viola, who did music for That Thing You  Do, and yeah, tons of great people.  We have this huge stable of songwriters helping us.  What was that double entendre song that you had?  Let's Duet.  Let's Duet got a massive, massive laugh at the screening we went to.  In My Dreams, You're Blowing Me.  Some kisses.  Yeah, that's me and Jenna Fisher, when we're falling in love in the movie, that's the song 
[02:02:30]  that we kind of started.  Based on kind of that Johnny Cash scene in Walk the Line.  Yeah, I guess so.  A little bit, a little bit.  I mean, the song's pretty original.  Well, Johnny and June never sang that to each other.  No, no, but I mean, it was that stage persona that you saw in Walk the Line, but obviously  it was very different.  They were communicating through the song.  Right, right.  You guys were communicating, and Johnny and June were singing, like, nice stuff to each  other, and you're just being kind of filth bagged.  Yeah.  Well, that's the thing.  Like, there's so many different aspects of this movie that people find appealing. 
[02:03:00]  Like, you like the darker stuff.  Like, you like the sausage and beans.  What?  I didn't say I like it.  The music.  And there's the music.  Way to twist that.  Thanks, John.  The music is something that's like this universal thing that everyone finds really appealing,  because we went, like I said, from the 1950s all the way to the present day, and along the  way, we, like, evoked all these different bands, like, you know, Elvis Presley and Johnny  Cash and Roy Orbison and Buddy Holly, to Brian Wilson and Bob Dylan, and, like, into the 
[02:03:30]  70s, into his kind of, like, lost era in the 70s, when he has his variety show on TV.  Dude, you, the, uh, God, I, I, the Bob Dylan stuff was hilarious.  I'll just say that.  Oh, thanks.  Where, it was like, what is he singing about?  Oh, yeah, what the F is he singing about?  And everyone's like, Clueless, like, what are you, well, you were playing, like, a Bob Dylan  character, like, your Dewey Cox kind of went through his Dylan stage, and the songs were  just nonsense.  You, you're great, as an actor, this is what John's great at, like, giving, uh, idiotic retorts, 
[02:04:00]  like, well, maybe he ripped me off.  Right, right.  Right, right.  Well, that's the thing, my character in this movie, this fictional guy, Dewey Cox, he goes,  you follow him from the beginning of his life all the way to the end, like, he thinks he's  the fountainhead of every musical movement.  You know, whatever he's in, he claims that everyone ripped him off, so it's almost like  a Forrest Gump of music, the movie, the way we go through all the different stages, and  how he's there at these cultural moments in, you know, music history.  Yeah.  I want to ask you something as an actor that I've been wanting to, with this fascinating, 
[02:04:30]  because I'm a big, we all are Philip Seymour Hoppin fans, you can't not be, and didn't  you guys do a, like, a two-person play together where you switched roles back and forth?  Yeah, it was called True West, it's a Sam Shepard play, we did it here on Broadway, yeah.  Was it about brothers, and how often did you switch the roles?  We switched roles every three performances, so sometimes, I mean, it just, and that's  just how it felt, we kind of broke it up evenly in every three performances, and then sometimes  on, like, matinee days, we do the matinee one way in the evening, the other way, that 
[02:05:00]  was pretty crazy.  The hell do you do that?  How great would that be to go see two different ways like that?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  It's a great way to sell tickets, I'll tell you that.  Yeah, right?  You'd see it twice.  Right, right.  Get everyone to see it twice.  When did you realize that you went from people that saw you, went, it's that guy, you know,  it's that guy, and then people actually know who you are.  Well, now it's that guy who showed me his nipples on the billboard, you know, I don't  know if you guys, I don't know if they're as ubiquitous as they are in L.A., but that 
[02:05:30]  poster for Walk Hard is everywhere in L.A. right now, and yeah, I'm topless in it, so.  It's a Jim Morrison, it looks like a takeoff of a Morrison photo, right, a very famous  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, but for a few years, it was, you know, you were out there, you were doing great work,  but it was like, that guy, I know him from this movie, or I've seen him there.  Yeah, it's still, you know, Talladega Nights kind of kicked things up a little bit in terms  of like, a lot of people knowing who I was, but it's still, you know, people still know 
[02:06:00]  me from a certain movie, you know, it's not like people still piece together all my work,  like, oh, it's that guy who played all those parts, it's more like, oh, I know him as  the fisherman from Perfect Storm, or the guy from Boogie Nights, or Talladega Nights, or  whatever, but that's fine with me, you know, if they know my characters better than me,  that's exactly my game plan, yeah.  Your list is so impressive, like, I didn't realize you were in a lot, I've seen a lot of  these movies, and I just didn't realize you were in, because I haven't seen them in years,  but State of Grace, Hoffa, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, I mean, you have an amazing, 
[02:06:30]  Gangs of New York, Magnolia, you have an amazing resume.  Thanks, man.  Were you in theater, like, early on, school?  Yeah, I did a lot of theater in Chicago, grew up doing, I mean, that's how I learned to sing,  was doing musicals in Chicago as a kid, and then I went to the Goodman School of Drama  at DePaul there, studied acting for four years, and then got really lucky, started working with  Steppamo Theater in Chicago, and then took a, even took a show here, Grapes of Wrath, we  took to Broadway here, that was when I first moved to New York. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, so you hammered it out as, like, one of these old-school actors who actually went  through all the channels, instead of just, hey, look at this guy, pluck him out of nowhere  and make him a star.  Overnight sensation.  With a face like mine, you gotta work, you know, you gotta put your back into it, it's  not like I'm some pretty boy who's gonna be handed the world overnight.  Dude, you played a porno star, I mean, how beautiful is that?  Yeah.  I mean, not that you're not a handsome fella, you know, but I mean, when you look at Marky Mark,  and you look at, you know, John, well, you wouldn't think of them both being naked with 
[02:07:30]  the same film.  But I'm saying that's what a great actor he is, is he played a porno star, I mean, that's  fantastic.  Well, you know, now in the days of Viagra, the porn world is different, but back in the  day, if you could make certain things happen on cue, it didn't matter what you look like,  you were the man for the job.  And you needed the mustache.  I'm not saying I could do that for real, but I played someone who could.  Did you ever watch them film them?  I got to host the porn awards a couple of times, and I've actually watched them make 
[02:08:00]  porn.  You hosted the porn awards?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow, like the NVA, what is it called?  AVN, yeah.  AVN, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did.  I visited one set, although, you know, when we made Boogie Nights, the world of porno  was so different.  I mean, we made that movie in the 90s, and we were talking about the 70s and early 80s  in our movie, but yeah, I remember going to visit one set, and these people were into  it.  They were actually doing it in this room with sweaty, and there was two girls and this  guy, and just dripping with sweat and makeup, and it was gruesome. 
[02:08:30]  And I'm watching this guy go at it, and he's, you know, messing with his junk, and he's  doing to the girl and everything, and I actually, I thought, this guy might recognize me.  He's going to come over and want to say hello, and I'm going to watch which hand he's using  to manipulate his junk, and sure enough, he's using his right hand, and he comes up to shake  my hand, and I'm a big fan, and I'm like, oh, man.  And he's shaking my hand, and I look down at his hand, and he goes, don't worry, I used  the other one, and I was like, in my mind, I'm thinking, no, you didn't. 
[02:09:00]  No, you didn't.  I was paying attention.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Hey, getting back to Walk Hard, the Beatles scene is on YouTube, and a lot of people are  viewing it.  How do you feel about that?  How do I feel about people viewing it online?  Before the movie comes out.  Oh, whatever.  It's like the small chunk of the movie.  It's a funny, funny scene.  Yeah.  Basically, they're doing the whole Beatles going to India thing, but Dewey Cox is with the Beatles  hanging out, and it gets pretty funny. 
[02:09:30]  Four amazing guys to play the Beatles in the movie.  We've got Jack Black, Paul Rudd, Jason Schwartzman, and Justin Long.  Right.  And they're all over the top with the accents.  They're every exaggeration of the Beatles, and they're just like four asses, but they're  the Beatles, and it's really a funny scene watching them infight and smash each other.  I got a really huge, there's a lot of really big laughs in this movie.  Because, again, I tend to like the harsher stuff, or the morbid stuff, or that type of  dark humor.  Yeah.  There's a lot of that in this movie. 
[02:10:00]  You know who was funny in the movie, too, was Tim Meadows.  Yep.  He kills in the movie, yeah.  He definitely killed for you in Walk of the Heart.  He plays my drummer, who gets me into every drug known to man.  Yep.  Start with a little pot, then it's the coke, and then it's the pills.  Pills.  Pills.  But he always starts off with, you don't want to do this.  Right.  And then he gives you all these great things that the drug does.  Right.  You don't want to smoke this.  It relaxes you, helps you create, makes you feel good.  Yeah, it's really funny stuff.  And one other thing, Elvis Presley, was that Jack White?  Yeah, Jack White with the White Stripes, yeah.  He did a great job with that scene. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, I thought he'd kill, man.  He came in, like, no one had any idea what he'd do.  I mean, we just loved him as a rock star, we thought, like, who better to play Elvis?  Right.  And then he came in and nailed it.  He was able to improvise.  We did a whole version of the scene where we did nothing but, like, gibberish.  Like, hi, man, I was home.  I was home.  I can't wait.  I'm on a grass.  I'm on a cornbread.  And he was just amazing.  Yeah.  Very good.  So you've got this going on.  You've got other films coming out.  It's got to be nice to know that you finally hit, man, after all these years of, like, you  know, trudging. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, you've got a great movie career.  Now you're just, you're pretty much, like, you're a really famous dude.  Yeah.  Well, we can always lay an egg this weekend.  You never know.  But, yeah, you know, it's, like I said, it's been a long, hard walk.  Walk hard.  So, yeah, the movie opens Friday?  Yeah, the 21st.  Walk hard.  And you're doing a concert here in New York?  Yeah, the Knitting Factory.  We're doing this little special.  Dewey Cox and the Hard Walkers are performing in their Cox Across America tour, 2007. 
[02:11:30]  So we've been doing, like, little mini concerts.  Well, not actually mini.  We do, like, an hour-long set for people after they see the movie.  Oh, very cool.  Yeah, we've been to Chicago, Cleveland, Nashville, Austin, and now we're doing New York.  So Knitting Factory, what day?  We have that right here.  It's Thursday, isn't it?  Thursday?  Okay.  No, it's Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday, December 19th.  Wednesday night.  It's 7 o'clock here in New York City at the Knitting Factory.  And we do have some tickets to admit, too, that we can give away to some fans.  Yeah, we'll give it away on the walkover or something.  Yeah, the Knitting Factory is a small place, so I would imagine it's going to be pretty tight already. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, it's a cool place.  I would love to go to that, man.  I actually have been there for a show, for a comedy show, and it's like a small little room with great acoustics.  It's a great place to see a game.  Cool.  Absolutely.  Well, we've got to get out of here.  They're going to turn us off here.  John C. Reilly from Walk Hard.  Movie opens on Friday.  Yeah, my pleasure.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, John.  It's a really funny, dark comedy, and you're great, man.  Thanks.  Thanks, Steve.  We're out of here.  We're heading over to XM.  If you're not joining us, have a good day. 
[02:12:30]  Jimmy, you good?  New Year's Eve, North Fork Theater, Long Island.  Please.  Please?  Pretty please?  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  You're welcome. 
[02:13:00]  Thank you. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Take care of the kids.  We've done the big everyone gets a present from everybody since I could remember going  over there.  Same house.  That's insane.  Same everything.  Since I was a little, little tater tot.  So how many gifts would you have to buy for, like, the extended family? 
[02:17:30]  50.  You'd have to buy for aunts, uncles, nephews you barely hang out with, nieces you barely hang  out with.  Yep.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Yeah, exactly.  So what would you do, like, buy one thing in many different sizes?  Nope.  You used to go out and go crazy because me, the procrastinator, I'd be out on Christmas Eve  running around, motherfucker, what do I get grandmas and fucking slippers?  But grandma's easy.  It's the uncle you don't really know much about, the aunt you don't know much about. 
[02:18:00]  I'm just saying in general.  Well, I don't know your relationship, but I'm just saying in general, that would be like,  that'd be a pain in the ass.  Who decided that was fun?  It's just the way it's always been.  As far as I remembered, it's the way it always was.  Ever since I was, I can remember.  We'd go, dude, same house in East Northport.  Same fucking house, same place, still go there.  It's like one of those constants in life.  But now, you know, I'll be in Colorado this year. 
[02:18:30]  It'll be fun there, right?  In a hotel.  Yeah, you're going to have fun in Colorado, though, man.  I will have fun.  Me and buddy, going to be drinking.  Wait, you're going to have fun because you've got a hotel room down the street.  Got a hotel down the street.  I'm going to rent a Porsche, I think.  Dude, you can't rent.  And just go wild.  You can't rent a Porsche.  It's the middle of winter.  Exactly.  What an idiot.  No, it's okay.  Grand Junction's weird. 
[02:19:00]  It'll get really cold.  And it might even snow.  But then in the afternoon, there's no snow to be found on the road.  It's freezing effing cold, but there won't be any snow.  One of these places where you ski in the morning and then you swim in a pool in the afternoon.  Let me tell you about it.  No, it's freezing cold all day.  Right.  But the snow isn't there.  It just doesn't snow a lot.  You can't get a Porsche.  That's just stupid.  Why?  Then I could drive those mountain roads.  They don't do well in the snow.  Depends on what you got.  Front wheel drive, right? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, but I'm not going to drive in the snow.  Yeah, you will.  I don't want to drive in the snow.  I'll take something else.  I'll take, you know.  You heard about the blizzard for Colorado, right?  No, blizzard.  I'll take the snowcat.  Yeah.  I'll call up that fucking dummy at the gas station.  You should just try to rent it.  From the airport.  I need a snowcat.  You should just rent a snowcap and drive around.  Drive around in the snowcat.  Until they pull it over and go, what are you doing?  Until somebody cuts my distributor cap out.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  A little.  John C. Reilly was cool, huh? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  He was a really nice guy.  He should have came over here.  He's probably.  I'm only guessing.  If he flew out of red eyes.  He was rubbing his eyes.  He was so exaustrated.  But he was a nice dude, man.  And it's like weird.  They really appreciate when you see the movie and stuff.  And he's a nice guy.  He's a trooper.  Because he walked in and you could tell he was really tired from a red eye.  But he went right into showbiz mode.  And he was really good.  I'm sure he's got a million interviews today.  And we liked the movie, Walk Hard.  It was nice.  It was nice.  Yeah, there was some really funny, dark shit in it, man. 
[02:20:30]  And if you guys call up.  If anybody calls up.  Can I say this?  If you want to go see the band play after the movie on Wednesday.  Knitting Factory?  Yeah.  I mean, there's a couple of admit to passes we'll be happy to give you.  Wait, so what's the deal?  You see the movie first.  Then you get to see Dewey Cox perform?  I don't know.  I think so.  But I mean, it is kind of cool.  Dude, how cool would it have been?  And seriously, we saw the screening last week.  And then right after the screening, we go somewhere else and watch him sing these songs.  That would have been kind of neat.  It is tempting to do.  And I had to bite my tongue, by the way.  And you might have heard it during the interview. 
[02:21:00]  I said, Tim Meadows, he's really funny in this movie.  In other words, Tim Meadows always sucks.  I fucking hate Tim Meadows.  And that's what I was kind of getting at that.  Wow.  I was going to say, and I wimped out.  I was going to say, how did you make Tim Meadows funny?  That's even worse.  I hate it.  I can't name one thing I liked that Tim Meadows did.  Come on.  SNL, all the SNL skits, all the cameos he did in other people's movies. 
[02:21:30]  What about that movie he put out?  Dude, it was god awful.  Yeah, Lady's Man.  One of the worst movies ever.  Yeah.  I think it was voted one of the worst movies ever on a lot of lists.  How many SNL movies suck, man?  Lorne Michaels really annoys me.  I don't know what he does to people.  The only good one I could even think of is Deuce Bigelow, European Gigolo.  What?  The second one.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, God.  I mean, there's a few good ones, like Blues Brothers.  Murphy was great on SNL, but there's so few good movies from SNL characters. 
[02:22:00]  Michael Myers put out some good ones.  Of course.  This is Pat was a big box of success.  Not the Halloween one, of course.  He just killed people.  There's more than one Michael Myers?  Well, there's Mike Myers, who puts out the movie, and then there's Michael Myers, the  one that kills people in the Captain Kirk mask.  Right.  Yeah.  Never confuse the two, by the way.  Right.  You ever look at a picture of a girl blowing someone and almost yell out, what a nice cock?  Wow.  What are you thumbing through? 
[02:22:30]  A hustler?  Oh, okay.  Highlights.  Highlights magazine.  Patrick in Colorado wants in on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, Patrick.  Hey, Patrick, what's up?  Morning, boys.  How you doing?  Morning.  Anthony, do not get a Porsche.  Bad idea.  What's the problem?  Well, there's a lot of snow on the ground.  I'm driving to work right now, and you'll probably die in a Porsche.  Where do you live?  Boulder, Colorado.  All right.  That's that.  March 14th, Jimmy's playing the Ogden Theater in Denver.  Oh, look at that.  That's a little different, though. 
[02:23:00]  Thank you.  Sure.  Grand Junction's a weird place.  It's in, like, this valley, and their weather is very different than the surrounding areas  and a lot of Colorado.  Colorado's got different weather, depending on where you are anyway, but Grand Junction  is really weird.  It's very fucking cold at night.  In the daytime, it doesn't get very cold, even in the winter.  Is it kind of like a...  Comparable to, uh...  Is it like a desert there?  Yeah, it's like the high desert.  It's like a high desert.  And, um...  Uh, the snow really doesn't accumulate that much. 
[02:23:30]  They'll have a big snowstorm every so often, but for the most part, you'll get some snow,  and then it'll be gone by the afternoon.  Right.  It'll just be gone.  It's the way it works.  But talk about motherfuck cold at night.  I mean, where you can't even...  Don't try to leave the house.  It's colder than Buffalo?  Yeah.  How do you know?  Temperature cold.  Because I've never been in a colder fucking place in my life.  We had an early morning flight, and we had to leave at like 3.30 in the morning or something. 
[02:24:00]  Right.  And take the bags out to the car.  The air itself was frozen.  And I shit you not, what would normally be fog was ice floating in the air.  It was...  The air was frozen!  That's fucked up.  It's too cold.  Buffalo's water.  Buffalo's weather was so cold at times in the winter when I lived up there that it would  bring you almost to tears.  It was so fucking cold.  I would wear long johns, and I didn't have a lot of money, so I had to pretty much wear 
[02:24:30]  the same couple of pairs over and over again.  No!  I was making $12,000 a year, and I had to pay for rent, and I was living away from home.  I literally had no fucking money.  And I would wear these things until they would pretty much fall off my body by spring.  Wow.  It was so fucking cold in Buffalo, because you get the lake effect snow, you get the wind  blown off the lake, and it's cold to begin with, because it should be part of Canada to  be, you know...  Yeah, it's just...  It should be...  It's one of those cold fucking places. 
[02:25:00]  It's just awful.  Oh, uh, by the way, you might notice my voice is shot, because I was just singing falsetto  for Tim.  Oh, were you?  Can we get Tim on the phone?  Give these boys a piece...  I was wondering how you did.  Give the boys a piece of my singing, uh, magic?  Ooh.  That's what I want to hear.  And can I comment?  I didn't even realize this was her.  This Brie Olsen that we had in studio last week is a hustler.  Yeah.  What a fat...  What a fucking sexy girl.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  You like that?  Holy shit, dude.  One of the Philly crew was pissed at me, because we didn't get her completely naked, because 
[02:25:30]  he said...  She's fantastic.  He said that she has one of the best pussies in all of porn.  It's fat, man.  Wow, is she fantastic.  I didn't even know she was in this.  I just happened to be...  PH or F?  F.  I don't say PH.  All right.  Just checking.  I wanted to see if you were street.  I am.  I've got a lot of what they call a creed.  A creed?  Cret?  Oh.  We got your Porsche, by the way.  What you got?  Andy in North Carolina.  Andy?  Yeah.  Hey, get a C4.  It's an all-wheel drive.  It'll handle it.  No problem.  Uh-huh. 
[02:26:00]  Get the old C4.  Very good.  I might not get a Porsche.  Huh?  I might not get a Porsche.  Why?  I might get something else.  I'm looking into some Toyota Camrys.  What do you think about that?  Wow, you're really sporting.  You're losing it.  You're losing it.  All right.  Uh, Justin in Utah.  Justin.  Hey, man.  What's happening, guys?  Hey.  Are you guys crazy?  SNL put out a lot of good movies.  Adam Sandler movies.  Oh, okay.  I forgot.  Chris Farley, Spade.  Yeah, you're right.  No, but based on SNL shit, right? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  That's what we're getting at.  Not the guys going on to movie success.  Based on the characters.  Name one good SNL movie.  Uh, Pat.  Pat was terrific.  Got to give it to you on that one.  Pat sucked.  That was a shitty movie.  Name one SNL movie.  Mr. Mike's Mondo video.  Yeah, you guys are right, but, you know, happy.  We're not talking about the guys that went on and became huge movie stars.  We're talking about an actual movie based on an SNL skit.  I can't even think of one that was good.  There was the, uh.  You're right.  You're right.  First Wayne's World. 
[02:27:00]  Happy birthday, genius.  Uh, uh, the first Wayne's World.  First Wayne's World.  End of bit.  End of bit right there.  Yeah, first Wayne's World was very funny.  It definitely was a very funny movie.  Uh, Dan in Colorado.  Yeah, this is, uh, Dan in Colorado calling from Grand Junction right now.  Got a live road report for, uh, Ant.  Yes?  Uh, it's barren dry everywhere, dude.  Yeah.  That's how it is.  It's pretty cold right now.  It's 16 degrees.  Uh, there's about an inch of snow on the ground. 
[02:27:30]  It was kind of crappy last week, but, dude, get a Porsche.  See, it is.  Like, the roads stay pretty dry, but it's just so fucking cold.  Right.  Uh, yeah.  It gets a little frigid, brother.  Hey, uh, Dan, you got a new job for the rest of the week.  You got to call up with, uh, the snow report for Anthony before he gets out there.  When are you flying, Ant?  Uh, Saturday.  Saturday?  Saturday.  Are you flying into Junction, Ant?  Uh, well, you know, I got to stop in Denver, and then I got to, uh, take one of those 
[02:28:00]  turbo prop.  He's taking the sideways planes.  He's taking the sideways plane.  The fucking loop-de-loop plane I got to take into, uh, Walker Field over there.  Oh, fuck.  Superstar.  We forgot about Superstar.  I had to land once.  It was snowed in so bad.  Or actually not even snowed in.  That frozen fog so bad.  I had to go to that other place.  What is it?  Telluride?  Yeah, it used to build down in Telluride.  Yeah.  It's just hella cold down there, too.  I had to get an airport over there, and then rent a car and drive into Grand Junction,  because the air was frozen.  That's a nice drive.  The air was frozen. 
[02:28:30]  Wait, they couldn't get planes in the air because the air was frozen?  They couldn't land my plane in, uh, Grand Junction, so they had to go to Telluride, and then  I had to, uh, drive a car a couple of hours.  Why didn't they just slide it in like you're going down a steep slope?  Yeah, that's it.  It would have hit the frozen air and just plummeted.  Yeah.  It would have deposited about three inches of ice on the wings.  Hmm.  All right, thank you, sir.  Not fun.  Not fucking fun.  Let's go to Kurt in the Poconos.  Kurt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Are you calling from a heart-shaped tub? 
[02:29:00]  Yes, I am.  A champagne glass?  Yeah, you got it.  Champagne glass would have been better.  Hey, on a great show there, Jimmy, on Friday night.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  Thank you.  I'm the didgeridoo guy.  Oh, I remember you.  Hi.  No, he doesn't really.  No, I do.  He tooted on my penis like a didgeridoo.  Absolutely.  Hey, Ian, I'll be sure if you're seeing a stand-up.  Didgeridoo.  I played on your show that one day.  We did a secret stand-up this year also, but I still feel obligated.  I went out and bought everybody gifts. 
[02:29:30]  Did you do the same thing?  You're the wreck-it guy.  Yeah, because then everyone else is looking at you like, what the fuck, dude?  You're blowing up my spot.  You wrecked it.  The reason I'm doing it is because I think everybody else is doing it, but even though  we're having a sacred Santa.  So did you buy any?  Did you break the rules?  I'm not getting anybody anything else.  Can't we just cancel Christmas?  Yeah.  Or make it into something else.  Oh, don't be such a screw, Jopie.  Let's cancel Christmas.  Make it into something else.  Hey, Jopie.  Yeah?  I'm the guy that sends you your Special Forces t-shirts.  Did you get your Pump House Jim's t-shirt? 
[02:30:00]  What?  This guy's just the guy that.  He's the guy that guy.  I am.  I'm the guy that.  And then insert something stupid that we don't care about here.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Linga-linga.  Thank you, sir, for all you do.  I just got a communique from Elo, the great Eric Logan.  He just writes, number one on iTunes, baby.  Number one on iTunes.  That's what we're talking about.  Is it Kenny? 
[02:30:30]  Is it once a week for these O&A shorts that you could download in the podcast section  of iTunes?  I don't know.  I don't either.  I think it's every week one comes out from CokeLogic.  Know what I'm suggesting?  There might be some other animators out there that want to give this a shot.  Mm-hmm.  Because CokeLogic is, you know, he's working around the clock like he's working in one  of those, like, sweat factories to try to get these fucking things out.  He's good, though.  He's really good.  Don't waste Logan's time, but if you're an animator, you want to animate one of our  bits and give it a shot, you can maybe send it off to Logan and let him decide if it's 
[02:31:00]  good enough, okay?  Yeah.  I actually debated doing that.  I mean, CokeLogic is the main guy, but it's not a bad idea to get a couple others just  maybe, you know, just the little side guys here and there.  Oh, you can make...  Not to take away from the CokeLogic.  You can make CokeLogic go like, oh, boy, they're trying to replace me.  No, not at all.  We love his stuff.  He's got a lot of pressure, though, because, you know, number one on iTunes, he's got to  be pumping these things out quickly.  Yeah.  And efficiently. 
[02:31:30]  Let's go to Patrick in Colorado.  Patrick.  Good morning, fellas.  Hey.  I just wanted to let you guys know about SalsaSnack.com.  It's going to be the new Two Girls, One Cup.  Just check it out.  SalsaSnack.com.  A lot of videos, people are saying this is the next Two Girls, One Cup.  Right.  So far, none of them have stacked up.  I remember a little band called Kaja Goo Goo was saying the same thing.  This is the next Two Shy Shy.  And it just never happened. 
[02:32:00]  They never got one of those, did they?  That's a one-hit wonder joke for everybody out there today.  Dave in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  I just want to ask Deconstructing Anthony there to please come back.  We really like you.  Deconstructing Anthony?  What are you talking about, sir?  You need to be safe and sound, sir.  Why?  Because we like you.  I'm safe and sound.  I'm the safest and soundest.  Yeah, he's just going to drive a Porsche really fast in Colorado in the middle of winter. 
[02:32:30]  What's wrong with that?  I like driving fast.  Merry Christmas, guys.  I was coming back from, actually, I was leaving Big Kev's Christmas party, his annual Christmas party this weekend.  Wow, where was that?  Sounds like it was a...  It was at his house.  And there's, like, about 30 people there.  And they do kind of a Secret Santa, but it's a whole different thing. 
[02:33:00]  It's the Spirit of Taking, it's called.  And you get a number.  When your number is chosen, you go up to the tree.  You grab a gift.  And then the next person's number is picked.  And then you can either get to the tree and grab a gift, or you can steal it from the person that just took theirs.  And then it goes the next number, and you can take it from anybody else.  So there's constantly people taking other people's presents.  Well, what if you liked what you unwrapped?  Attaboy.  You don't unwrap it until the end. 
[02:33:30]  So some of these presents will get, like, celebrity status.  Like, I want the one with the shiny one and the bow.  And that present becomes, like, the coveted present, even though no one knows what's inside of it.  Everyone's stealing it back and forth.  And then you open it up, and there's nothing.  There's bubble wrap inside or something.  And then the little piece of shit one no one wanted to get, that's what the good one is.  Regardless, that isn't even the point I was making.  We were talking about driving.  What did you end up getting?  People at least need to know that. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, God.  After all this trading and conniving and giving.  I wound up getting the complete Josie and the Pussycats cartoon series on DVD.  Very nice.  That's an awful gift.  They have long tails and ears for hats.  For hats.  Guitars.  Guitars.  And then something else.  And suits that are good for hazmat.  I don't know.  I don't know the rest of the song.  But Frenchie was there.  You know, Mark, the French chef, of course.  Also known as the has-been. 
[02:34:30]  Yes, the has-been from the show.  Yes.  And he was there, and he goes, I get lost coming here.  I don't have a navigation.  I will follow you to New York.  And I go, no, no.  Mark, I do 100 miles an hour.  And he goes, I drive fast, too.  I go, no, I literally do 100 miles an hour.  You cannot follow me.  It's impossible.  And then he left dejected before I did, I think, because I think he kind of thought I was being rude. 
[02:35:00]  But I really do 100 miles an hour.  You should have rear-ended him on the way home.  Wham.  Pushed him on the guardrail.  A scene out of Duel.  Any problems going 100 miles an hour?  Nope.  I love it.  It should be the fucking speed limit.  Yeah.  100.  I would pay.  What would I pay?  I'd pay $20 a day for my own lane.  For, like, a highway that's just for people willing to pay $20 a day to be on that.  And if you fuck up, you're not allowed to use it. 
[02:35:30]  And by fucking up, I mean going under a certain speed limit, not moving over.  It's two lanes.  One lane's for passing.  One lane's for driving.  Both of them got to be very fast.  And get the fuck out of the way.  They are thinking of doing HOV lanes for rich people.  To get into the city.  30 bucks a pop, right?  Yes.  For rich people, you'd like...  I'm in as long as I could pedal to the metal.  They're thinking about it.  But you know that's just going to get so clogged up.  It's going to bother people so much.  Oh!  Rich people are flying in. 
[02:36:00]  I would wave to everybody.  Oh, yeah.  They wouldn't see it because I'd be going much too fast.  They say they guarantee, like, less than a 10-minute way of the tunnel to get in.  Which everybody would do, no matter where your financial status is, once in a while, if  you were late for a meeting, or if you were going to be fired, if you didn't make it in  by a certain time.  I mean, there's times where that could come in very handy.  Yes.  I'm boring myself at this point.  Did you like the Big Kev holiday party?  It is always fun.  It sounds like fun. 
[02:36:30]  It's at his house.  Why can't you ever trash Big Kev?  I've trashed Big Kev.  There's nothing fun about what you just described.  No, you've got to be there.  Why?  You can't describe it.  Because everyone is buying awful gifts and wrapping them up.  So then the big goof is like, oh, you got Josie and the Pussycats.  No, no, the whole thing of it is the fact that certain boxes that are wrapped up get  celebrity status, where I want that.  So alliances are made between couples and friends to try to figure out how you can keep 
[02:37:00]  that, because if someone takes it, then the other person will take it from them and get  it somehow back to you.  How drunk do you have to get for that to be exciting?  Oh, hammered.  All right, good.  Out of your gourd drunk, you got to get.  Yuck.  Maybe I'm just jealous because I've never been invited to Big Kev's Christmas party.  Well, why would I?  Our own E-Rock was there.  And the lovely Mrs. E-Rock.  E-Rock was at the party? 
[02:37:30]  Yes, he was.  I wasn't invited either.  Jimmy Norton wasn't invited?  Nope.  Well, that isn't me.  Big Kev thinks I hate him.  I don't hate him.  I just can't relate to him.  That's all.  That was funny.  I was like, Big Kev thinks I hate him.  I don't hate him.  I don't hate him.  It's just a strong dislike.  No, I don't even dislike him.  I just can't relate.  I can't relate to that geek crap.  That geek culture.  Well, he's got...  Not at all.  He has some fun interviews.  I do like his horrendous interviews.  Rule.  The best one was Samuel L. Jackson. 
[02:38:00]  Amazing.  Okay.  I must say, I've never heard a more in-depth interview with a person than I did Samuel L. Jackson when  Big Kev interviewed him at one of those Comic-Con disasters that he goes to.  We'll get that interview now that you refer to it.  Please.  In Boston.  Go, Pats.  Go.  What's up, Rick?  Good morning, fellas.  Hey.  I just want to comment one thing on Jimmy's fantastic show Saturday night, that shithole  in Scranton.  Thank you.  And I agree with you. 
[02:38:30]  Those Christmas lights on Music Street stink.  Yes, they do.  What is that about, Jimmy?  Me and Kenny are driving to the gig, and we see a line of traffic, and we're like, oh,  fuck, it must be an accident.  It turns out all these zilches are on Music Street making a right to look at lit houses.  I've never wanted a Molotov cocktail so badly in my life.  Why?  Because they're shithouses.  Lit houses.  Why do they do it here?  People are shitheads.  How did, uh...  How was it being with Kenny all weekend? 
[02:39:00]  It was as it normally is.  Look at that little kid move her ass.  I know.  That's amazing.  How does a little girl learn to move her ass like that?  Sir, why do you insist on continuing to talk?  We're trying to watch TV.  I'm sorry.  Ow.  I just don't get it.  I just broke my finger.  She's a dancer.  Yeah, well, she's a dancer, all right.  She's going to be on a pole when she's fucking 18. 
[02:39:30]  She's very good.  At that rate.  Rick, go ahead.  I just want to comment on the Secret Santa.  We've done that two years in a row, and I continually have gotten shafted with $25 gift certificates  from either a gas card or fucking Walmart.  All right, thanks.  God bless you.  And Matt from Mansfield fucks dick.  All right, let's say hi to Big Kev.  Big Kev?  Hey, there's Big Kev.  Good morning.  Hey.  Kev, thank you.  I did have a good time at your bash. 
[02:40:00]  Okay.  Thank you for coming.  Well said.  I'm very hurt that I wasn't invited.  I'm sorry.  I've never invited Jim, and I'm sorry about that.  I did invite Opie one time, but he didn't come, and I didn't really think he would, but  I extended the invitation anyway.  What was my excuse for not going?  I want to remember.  I think you laughed at me when I invited you.  Oh, not even an excuse, just laughter. 
[02:40:30]  And I wonder why I sit at home alone every weekend.  This is the dark side of what I do for a living.  It sucks.  Phone doesn't ring, no email, nothing.  I actually laughed at your invitation.  Yeah, you laughed at me when I invited you.  And then I left the party, and then I stopped in the city to have a little drink with Dan.  Yeah?  Yeah.  For his post-show little drinking wind-down period. 
[02:41:00]  Nice.  And then drove home in some horrific ice storm that came out of nowhere.  Boy, that was treacherous.  So, Big Kev, the big Christmas party was a success?  Oh, yeah.  We had about 35 people in my apartment.  It was very nice.  I'm sorry I've never invited you, Jim.  I probably should have.  Why wouldn't you?  Because I know you're very busy, and I didn't think you would come on a Saturday night.  I'm sure you have spots to play and things, but I guess I should have invited you anyway. 
[02:41:30]  No, you're right.  I couldn't come, but I know you would have let me come on.  But let's be honest.  Why didn't you invite Jimmy?  That's why I didn't invite him.  Let's be honest.  Let's be honest.  Because people will at least invite knowing that the person can't come, just to cover all bases.  I really, that's the only reason I didn't invite Jim.  I get along great with Jim, I think.  I sense a problem between you and Jimmy.  What is it?  No problem between Jim and I.  I sense a problem.  The one I'm making right now. 
[02:42:00]  You're not going to create one, so no, there's no problem.  No, there's definitely a problem.  What would it be?  I don't know.  Why don't you create, I mean, tell me.  All right, Big Kev.  All right, take care.  Could you invite me next year?  Sure, I'll invite you.  I'd love to have your girlfriend at the party.  Yeah, I know.  That's the problem with me right now.  Everyone wants to hang out with my girlfriend, but not me.  People like you.  No, they don't.  People just like her better.  They like her a lot better. 
[02:42:30]  That's fine.  Why?  Because she's fun and smiley?  My own family likes her better than me at this point.  You're a good egg.  That's why I'm going to go to a therapist.  I'll definitely be my hope.  If you want to make a shout out of the big city, you're definitely invited for next year.  All right.  Are you going to a therapist?  No.  You should.  That was just the radio bit.  No, no, no.  It was?  Let's talk about it.  No, I'm not going.  I think you'd like it.  No!  Why don't you just try it?  No!  I think you're open enough.  All right, I'll try it as a goof.  If you sit there with my observations. 
[02:43:00]  And just try it.  I think you're open enough.  No!  To benefit from it.  For real.  I'm not saying you need it because you're nuts, but you're open enough to benefit from it.  No.  Look how uncomfortable he's getting it.  Even the prospect.  No.  But you would goof on it, but something helpful would happen.  Like what?  Like they cause you to look at things, and they show you patterns, which is really helpful  because the thing about them that I like is they have no interest in me whatsoever. 
[02:43:30]  And that's the selling point for me.  They have no reason to lie.  Time?  Yeah, that's why I can't go.  That's what they'll do.  Good.  Does a regular doctor, when he fixes me up, give a shit about me?  Of course he doesn't.  First question.  Where's your insurance?  At least some therapist will work on a sliding scale with you if you don't have money.  I mean, I don't care what their motives are.  I care what they can tell me.  No, I already know my deal.  Knowledge is no defense.  And I'm...  Holy shit.  Where did you read that from?  It's true.  It's about alcoholism. 
[02:44:00]  Knowledge is no defense against the first drink, as they say.  Wow.  The first drink.  The first drink.  Like if I know I'm an alcoholic, well, that knowledge does nothing to stop me from using it.  All right.  I'm going to throw myself under the bus.  Fuck that therapy.  Where does this go?  What is it?  Where does this go?  You talk for an hour.  Oh.  They help you.  I haven't cried in therapy.  I'm much more open to crying in other places.  She's very...  She gets all the information.  I want to get a good cry in.  It can be very helpful.  I think it'd be very helpful. 
[02:44:30]  No.  I think you'd like it.  It would be the end of the radio show.  No, it wouldn't.  No.  Yeah, it would be.  No way.  Oh, yeah, it would be.  I got something for you guys.  Instead of therapy, I...  I like therapy.  I lose myself in music.  I think without the therapy, it could be the end of the radio show.  Exactly.  I know.  That's the scary part.  Why do you think I'm pushing you?  What the hell are you talking about?  I know it wasn't because you actually cared about me. 
[02:45:00]  That's not true.  I do care about you.  That's not true at all.  I do.  I'm not stupid.  I care about you very much.  We were off the air.  Did I not care about you?  Not really.  Knowing that we'd someday be back?  Of course I did.  I like to sing.  That's my therapy.  Everyone knows that.  You're good.  CD2.  CD2.  CD2.  I can't play this.  Because I know how bad this is.  This is the raw audio, though.  They're going to like...  Play it. 
[02:45:30]  It's going to be great.  Let's hear.  Let's hear.  It's going to be good.  Come on.  I lost my voice because I was trying to sing my heart out.  Let me hear.  I want to hear you.  Because you put out...  You built out a tune.  Let me hear.  You hold a note.  Let me hear.  I got my headphones real tight now.  All right.  I hope you know.  I hope you know.  That this has nothing to do with you.  It's personal.  You know, myself and I.  We've got some straightening out to do. 
[02:46:00]  And I'm going to miss you like a child misses their blanket.  But I got to get a move on with my life.  It's time to be a big girl now.  And big girls don't cry.  Big girls don't cry.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.  This son of a bitch on some level actually likes his voice.  I do not. 
[02:46:30]  He likes his voice.  That was...  That's me actually...  That's me actually trying to sing.  Really?  Yes.  You thought that was me doing a goof.  Yeah.  That was me giving it my all.  Well, that's kind of a hard song for a guy to sing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because it's, you know, not a guy's song.  Yeah.  There's no more takes, right?  I think there's another take.  I can't wait.  It's time to be a big girl now. 
[02:47:00]  Big girl.  And big girls don't cry.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.  This could be the first time ever the PalTalk people are bitching that the sound is on.  You're making me cry. 
[02:47:30]  That's really me trying to sing, though.  Please mute the room.  See, I know what I could have done as a goof and sound, you know, like awful on purpose,  but that's what I...  My whole angle was to try to actually sound good.  Everyone's saying the ringtone.  That's going to be their new ringtone.  Jimmy can't even look at me.  How can you after that?  I was thinking, yes, the Joke Man, Snap Man. 
[02:48:00]  Mm-hmm.  But that's my falsetto.  Song of the year?  Well, there's a fan.  That's my falsetto.  Thank you.  Why don't we take a break?  That would be...  No!  You'll love it.  I've been nicer lately.  It's not about being nice.  My chick calmed me down.  She's got me on the right path.  I don't need a therapist.  You do?  No, that's for like...  No.  It's helpful.  No, it's not for me.  It's helpful. 
[02:48:30]  No.  Because they don't give a shit.  That's the beauty of them.  No.  They don't pretend to give a shit.  That's why I like them.  No, I would know if they were pretending to give a shit, and that's the problem.  Because I think they do pretend to give a shit, and they don't give a shit.  No, no.  No one's supposed to give a shit.  You develop a relationship with them after a while.  It's not a give a shit.  My therapist is giving me her number.  She's like, if you have a real problem, call me, like with this or that.  Like, she's actually...  But after a while, and they get to know that you're not some psychopath.  But, uh...  She's good. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, man.  It's not a cure-all.  But it's like helpful.  Like, I do feel a lot better.  Like, I see patterns in myself.  I'm like, fuck.  What am I doing?  I really do.  Like what?  What's one of the patterns?  Behavioral patterns about getting close to people and shit like that.  Like with a girlfriend, why do I get to a certain point and then back off emotionally?  What the fuck am I afraid of?  It's not even about sex.  Like, why do I get to a certain point where I'm in love, and then try to wreck it somehow?  Is there an answer to that? 
[02:49:30]  Um, I don't know.  I mean, it's almost like...  I realize this myself.  I got so mad at my girlfriend for teasing my glasses.  And then I remembered that when I was in sixth grade, I got glasses for the first time, and  the girl I was in love with didn't like them.  I'm like, yeah.  Oh!  Second time.  It's weird how you connect things.  The glasses are a little weird, though.  Of course they are.  They're coming off Friday.  Yeah.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday-wide.  And does your girlfriend now, um, prefer sitting in sticker bushes?  Then...  Exactly. 
[02:50:00]  That's exactly what it is.  I love that story.  But I just realized certain things that I didn't...  Poor little Jimmy.  She'll help me realize things I don't like about other people sometimes are things that  I have in myself.  Like, she's, you know, she's like, are you sure that's not something that, uh, you don't  do?  I'm like, ugh.  Really?  Die already.  But yeah, she's sharp.  Die already.  But she's nice.  She's not imposing, and she's not a phony.  She's a nice woman.  And it's easier to talk to a woman.  Yeah.  And she's not judgmental.  She doesn't give a shit what you tell her.  Like, as far as, oh, tsk, tsk. 
[02:50:30]  Which people who care about you do.  I mean...  No.  No.  I don't.  No.  I'll drive you.  Let's say, uh, what's...  Uh, Jim in Jersey, what's up?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  Hey, Jim.  Please, never play that ever again.  I'm actually hiding under my desk right now.  That was me really giving it my all, too.  Oh, dude.  How...  I mean, let's be honest.  How bad was that?  Uh, it was pretty bad. 
[02:51:00]  It wasn't even, like, bad enough to be funny.  It was just really bad.  It's just pretty bad.  It's just pretty bad.  Yeah.  Like, when Kenny sings bad, it's funny.  Yeah.  When I sing bad, you just feel sorry for me.  Well, the difference was that you have no music with yours, which...  Well, that was the raw audio.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I know, but we're kidding.  It's raw audio, and...  Yeah, I'd be surprised to hear that, um...  I want to hear that with the music.  No, you won't.  Yeah.  You definitely want to hear it with the music.  No, you won't be hearing that.  Why?  With the musical background?  No.  I think we should. 
[02:51:30]  No.  See, this is the only copy.  And...  It'll be awkward at first.  I mean, you sit down, and they'll go, like...  Shut up!  And you go, I'm all right.  I'm not too sure why I'm here.  I don't think I really need it.  No, I know...  Well, tell me what you think.  I know all my issues, I just gotta, like, like...  I don't know.  Well, I know mine too, but...  I can write them down for you.  There's a book about them, but it doesn't matter.  Look, this show works because we all have our issues.  Let's just keep it that way.  Yeah, no.  Like, my demons that make me funny, there's a very fine line with harnessing them. 
[02:52:00]  It's like the same things that make me funny ruin me.  So, there has to be a way to harness that part of myself and make it work for me, but it's  also very destructive.  You're not gonna get rid of who you are.  That's the fear that I was gonna lose.  You just know where you came from.  But you described what I do for the show.  Some of the things that are endearing to listeners also can ruin us.  No, but there's... 
[02:52:30]  I like that.  Yeah, but I have the same kind of monsters.  And at times, they're very productive for me.  And I'm not talking about you secretly by saying me.  I sincerely am talking about me.  At times, they are fucking very productive and helpful in my heart.  And at times, they hurt me and make me less productive.  My sexual addiction...  That's not about just fucking hoogers.  Like...  You know, it's about...  It's about fucking...  What is this fucking need to not be alone with myself in a room?  I cannot be alone with fucking Jim Norton. 
[02:53:00]  Really?  Yes.  Like, it's amazing I've gotten anything done.  As much time as I spent jerking off and fucking distracting myself.  She told me, like, I like to avoid feeling something.  And I understand that.  I'm like, yeah, but I'm afraid of being bored.  And she's like, well, your life now sexually is boring.  I mean, not with your girlfriend, but with what you do with the porn.  She's like, what's exciting about that?  It's the same stuff over and over.  That's hard to...  Do you think you're therapist?  It's hard to argue, though.  I mean, like, that's a hard point for a therapist to argue. 
[02:53:30]  What do you mean?  It's the same thing over and over.  No, it's fucking porn.  You can jack off to that until the fucking cows come home.  You can.  And then jack off to the cow.  Yeah, absolutely.  And then jack off to the cow's mouth, cut eater.  What's her point?  Just that, like...  She's trying to downplay the hotness of porn.  No, she's not.  What she's saying is I'm using it to numb myself for feelings.  And the sexual obsession is a numbing element.  And she's right.  It numbs me.  It takes me away from feeling anything, from experiencing anything. 
[02:54:00]  From being Jimmy Norton.  Just from being alive, man.  It really does.  And it's like anything else.  I mean, drinking has a more obvious effect because you're drunk.  Drugs have a more obvious effect.  But when you're zoned out, and you're just zoned out, you feel nothing.  You know what I mean?  It's like you're feeling turned on, quote unquote.  But sometimes my dick's not even hard.  I'm just jerking off my dick's not hard.  Like, what am I doing?  I'm fucking running.  It's silly.  Wow.  What is it about Jim Norton that can't be just alone with your own thoughts?  I don't know. 
[02:54:30]  Still trying to figure that one out.  Same thing that Anthony Cumia and Greg Hughes have.  It's called self-loathing.  And let's be honest, it comes out in everybody in different ways.  I have a problem with confrontation.  Yes.  I don't confront.  I don't voice my feelings.  I won't talk to people about, you know, if I'm upset about something or things like that.  I'll just plaster on my smile and go through my day. 
[02:55:00]  Suppressing rage, of course.  I mean, you know, it's all childish stuff.  Anything, rage or anything else.  And I think it is because when I was growing up, my lovely environment I grew up in with my parents,  who are completely confrontational and confronting each other all the time,  why would I want to revisit that?  Why in God's name would I ever want to revisit confrontation when it's all I grew up with?  I'll tell you why.  So I don't.  I fucking, I go to another place. 
[02:55:30]  Because that fucking, it's stuffing stuff is so bad.  It's so, it's almost like,  Is it?  It's so fucking, it's a health risk.  And I know it is, but I feel myself, the rage I feel, the irrational shit comes out.  When I don't deal with stuff, I deal with it somehow.  You put air on too much air on the balloon, it bursts for that, you know, but it fucking comes out of bad times.  Yeah.  It comes out of bad fucking times.  Like, I have so much anger from other stuff that comes out, people think I'm mad at them, but I'm not. 
[02:56:00]  It's like, I don't know how to fucking be healthy with it.  I, um, I had another incident this weekend.  What?  Speaking of rage.  Oh, boy.  That you just reminded me of.  You know when you, like, see in, like, mafia movies, like how they slam car doors into people's heads and stuff?  That's a good one.  I like that move.  I, uh, might have done that this weekend.  Yeah.  How's Lindsay?  No, I don't know.  Oh.  No.  No, my rage is getting a little, uh, a little scary at times. 
[02:56:30]  Maybe that's why I have to talk to someone.  No, we were, went to, uh, dinner on Friday and, uh, here in New York City was an awful, horrible night and it was almost impossible to get a cab, right?  So we started walking and it was brutally cold with the windchill and stuff and I'm just trying to take care of my girl.  I can walk home, whatever.  I'm like, all right, we got to get a cab, right?  So we're on a side street and, uh, all of a sudden, lucky us, the, the cab's light goes on right as we're in front of it and these, uh, this lady's getting out. 
[02:57:00]  So, uh, Lindsay all excited, like we got a cab, like, holy crap.  And this cab's not even near the traffic light.  So, uh, so she's actually holding the door while the two ladies get out and all of a sudden this guy comes from nowhere and goes, that's my cab.  And he didn't see me, but he saw Lindsay and thought he could take advantage of Lindsay.  And he's like, that's my cab.  I, I, I, the cabbie, there's no, I, the cabbie, go fuck yourself.  That's exactly what I said. 
[02:57:30]  I said, go fuck yourself.  This is our cab.  And at that moment I saw another guy and I'm thinking to myself, fuck, I'm not that stupid.  I'm like, fuck two on one.  I'm going to get my ass fucking kicked.  Turns out the other guy wasn't with him.  And at that split moment, as I was sizing up the situation, trying to figure out what I'm going to do, the guy pretty much pushes Lindsay aside and jumps in the cab.  So I hold the door and I'm ready to yank him out.  And he, he was, uh, it was obvious I wasn't gonna be able to yank him out.  And his, his foot, his whole leg was still out of the cab. 
[02:58:00]  So I got two really good shots in with the door, boom, boom, really hard.  The guy went into panic mode, was able to close the door and took both his hands and locked the door right in front of us.  And he was in a major panic.  And then I might've started yelling and screaming, begging Lindsay to let me beat the shit out of the guy.  And I was, and then I spit on the cab.  Oh, I see nothing wrong.  And then the rage was over, but then I looked like an idiot cause everyone's looking at me.  But I, in that moment I was, I was so fucking in, in, I wanted, that's a clear reason to be mad. 
[02:58:30]  And I wanted to beat the shit out of the guy.  And I, I, I was asking my girl, I'm like, please give me permission to stop this fucking cab and beat the shit out of this guy.  I was so pissed.  And the reason I was pissed and whether it makes sense or not was that the guy didn't see that there was anyone with Lindsay and thought he could just strong arm his way, you know, past a girl to, to grab a cab in, in horrible weather here in New York.  When any other person would have like gave their cab to a chick, right? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  And that situation, if you're both running for a cab and it's questionable whose cab it is, I swear to God, cause I know people think I'm one way on the show.  So I'd be the one going, yeah, here, why don't you have this cab?  I'll, I'll try to, you know, I'll walk her.  Or how about something like, Hey, where are you going?  Maybe we can share the ride.  I'd be happy to beat a hot chick out for a cab.  I would love it.  But I went, I went old mobster film and I, I took the door and started beating him up.  Whack his leg.  Whacked his leg twice.  And then he was able to get the leg in and lock the cab. 
[02:59:30]  Should have kept his leg out.  Cab explodes like Vince's limo.  Nice.  Right.  But that's not like the, to me, the, the angry part of that is more like when you, when  you feel like you can't defend your girl, like that's almost about like the girl is there  and you feel like she's somehow been violated in like, even in a shitty way of kind of pushing  their way by her and then you can't be helpless.  You know what I mean?  That's about letting her know that she, she's fucking lack of masculinity at that point.  And it's, that's, what's very frustrating.  You have to be able to defend your chick. 
[03:00:00]  I was livid.  And the only reason I didn't like pull him, cause like I said, I saw, I saw this other  guy and I'll be honest to the, the other guy was a pretty big fucking dude.  And, uh, you know, as much as we all like act like tough guys, we, we size up the person  you're going to mess with.  That's just human nature.  And I saw there was going to be two on one and the second guy was a lot bigger, but it  was just another guy walking by.  And that's what pissed me off more than anything.  And the guy was able to get in the cab when I turned around.  You've distracted me, you cocksucker.  Beat the big guy up.  So I had a little more, another moment on Friday. 
[03:00:30]  That's not that bad.  I mean, it's not like, at least you had a reason to be annoyed, but I mean, but you didn't  handle it right.  But, but the best, and I wasn't drunk or anything.  The best was after the incident, he locked the car door.  I'm screaming, not screaming, but yelling as loud as I can.  Please give me permission to beat the shit out of this guy.  And she's looking at me like, you're insane.  Hey lunatic.  Calm the fuck down.  Oof.  Calm the fuck down.  But back to therapy.  I think. 
[03:01:00]  For you, it's working, right?  You're fine.  Yes and no.  At times it is, at times it's not.  Trust me.  I've, I've, uh, I've, uh, controlled myself an awful lot in the last two months.  I'll just say that much.  But my thing is not even like.  There's so much stuff I want to say and do.  And I, and I, trust me, I'm, I'm doing a lot more thinking these days.  Trust me on that.  I know.  Then that's all I'll say about that.  But.  Because even just discussing this will get me in trouble.  Therapy is good.  Like certain people.  Therapy is very helpful. 
[03:01:30]  Nothing wrong with going in.  Because the stuff's already in there.  It already affects me.  No.  So why not vomit it?  Because that's what it is.  It's emotionally vomiting.  I'm fully aware of my chemical makeup.  It's very, it's very cut.  You know, it's very cut, cut, uh.  Cut and dry?  Cut and dry.  Yeah.  My mom was completely insane my whole life growing up.  And my dad was completely normal and full of love.  And I got, right down the middle, I got both of them.  Right down the middle.  Pow!  So there's ways to make the lovings.  So what am I going to do about that? 
[03:02:00]  I'll tell you what.  There's ways to make, because I think that you're, you're a lot sweeter, and this is corny,  but you're, you're, you're much nicer than people would think.  You're much more responsive to emotional and nice stuff than people would think.  So there's a way to embrace the one side of me.  Of course.  And let the other side be there, because it's always going to be there, but make it, there's  ways to fucking let the good side of me kind of win in the arguments with the shitty side  of me.  Like, you know what I mean?  There's a lot of ways to do that without torturing myself.  Practice is one way. 
[03:02:30]  I think, I mean, I'm a fucking loon.  I have to go.  You know?  Yeah.  I'm not out banging.  It's just, it doesn't matter.  Right.  When you're jerking off for that many hours or whatever you're doing for all that time  and it's making you unhappy, it's like, what the fuck am I doing?  I just think it's hysterical going to therapy, but no, no, no offense.  Oh, no, of course not.  Because you're jacking off.  Well, it's not just for jacking off.  I know.  It's for the obsessive.  That must be a little weird, though, talking to a female therapist about your jerking off.  It's weirder than, I would rather talk to her. 
[03:03:00]  You think she gets hot?  No, no, she doesn't give a fuck.  You honestly don't think she doesn't give a fuck?  Not even a little.  Talk about sexual shit.  With me?  No, because I'm not talking about hot stuff, you know, at all.  I'm not being sexy in my descriptions.  I'm just being blunt.  By the way, I wasn't going for a joke there.  Oh, no, I know.  I was really curious.  I know.  Because I'm sure therapists hear a lot of stuff and I wonder if they're like, you know,  they're being professional, but inside they're like, holy shit, this is fucking, I'm going  to spend a couple more minutes on this subject for my own personal use.  I'm very informative with my therapist. 
[03:03:30]  She gets all information, but I'm not emotional with her.  Like, I can't cry in therapy.  I can cry around my girlfriend or I can cry watching a movie because I'm a fucking sap.  Right.  But in therapy, I don't cry.  And like, I'm talking to you guys right now, like as detached as I am right now and just  giving you information.  That's why I talk to her.  And she actually said to me at times, like, I feel like you're performing right now.  Like, not comedically, but you know, she's right.  At times I am.  Just doing like a monologue.  Yes.  Just again, dishing out information to her with no connection to what I'm saying. 
[03:04:00]  That's fine though.  You're talking.  Right.  You are.  Is it calculated to try to, is, is what you're saying calculated in a way where you're trying  to sway her, not opinion of you, but like, like you're, you're choosing your words a  little too carefully and maybe shining them up a little bit and you ought to just spew  the shit out.  Sure.  Like to add this because I want her analysis to kind of go along with what I already think  of myself.  So of course I want to send it out that way.  Um, but you know, she points stuff out and she's not overbearing. 
[03:04:30]  I can't take that shit.  It's people think it's just, it's going to be like ordinary people where you call your  therapist at three in the morning crying and they rush over in their sweater.  My God, what's wrong?  Are you having a breakthrough?  My God.  Never.  But she did say, if you really need to, you can call me.  It's okay.  And she meant it.  You're that fucked up where even if in the middle of the night you need something, call  me.  Yeah.  Like if something's really wrong or whatever, uh, my girlfriend's in therapy as she should 
[03:05:00]  fucking be.  Oh no.  But I mean like she has like a long years long relationship with her, with her therapist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's like for years ago it was like, ah, it's this trendy thing people do.  But in life there's so much fucking tension and so much pressure and stress and there's  so many ways to unhealthily fucking build shit up.  It's just a healthy hour a week for me.  Yeah.  By the way, Matt LaFar from Queensbury.  We love Matt LaFar from Queensbury. 
[03:05:30]  He writes, nice split personality, Opie.  One minute singing like a faggot.  Next minute slamming a guy's leg in a car door.  I can't believe Jimmy thinks you need therapy.  What?  Why is Dan and Sam trying to do their own radio show during our radio show?  What, what happened?  Sam forgot to use his inside voice.  There was, your mic was on right here.  Yeah.  What happened?  No, we're just putting together line of the day.  Oh, we can go home already?  Yes.  All right. 
[03:06:00]  I think it's brought to you by Bodog.  Hint, hint.  No, it's going to happen there.  I looked the clock on.  Wow.  What are you saying, hint, hint?  This is kind of interesting radio.  People are kind of glued to their radio sets.  It's being really silly.  I've been enjoying this too and I think Jim's onto something.  A good, uh, shut the fuck up.  I am.  Ant could use a phone.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Oh, text message.  I think a good cry for Ant would be helpful.  I don't need a cry.  That's for sure.  I think so.  When was the last time he cried?  When was the last time he cried?  Anger's a cover up. 
[03:06:30]  I, let me, I, let me think.  No, anger isn't a cover up.  I'm trying to think.  I'm saying for, not just for you.  Extreme whole makeover last night was a tough one.  And before you call in, I didn't even see it.  I'm done with that stupid show.  It started, it started bringing emotion out of me and I don't want that.  Anger's saying good.  So I watched it three weeks in a row and I, I know what this is about and I've seen enough.  But my anger doesn't come out, Jimmy.  It comes out in little bursts, uh, if it really builds up. 
[03:07:00]  But not in bursts where, you know, I'm frigging, uh, uh, punching people.  It just, it comes out in like, oh my God, am I fucking pissed?  But then it's like enough.  But then, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you push it down.  Yeah, I can't be, I'd rather be diplomatic and solve a problem at the expense of me getting  angry and letting that out.  That, that to me is easier.  It's like, almost like a martyrdom kind of thing. 
[03:07:30]  Like, I'll take the anger, I'll take the, the shit and stuff, but I need to diplomatically  and, and, um, very civilly, uh, take care of an issue or a problem that I'm having.  Well, that's like, doing stuff like that's like responsible.  Like when you're not, you don't act in anger, you handle things like whether it's in my  work or my professional life, my personal life or on stage.  I mean, there's times where I don't allow the anger to overrun me because it can block  things.  Of course.  But there are certain times I should be angry and express it and I don't. 
[03:08:00]  Why is Jimmy bringing this mumbo jumbo to the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, I think that most of our fans are fucking self-hating, self-hating, and I'll tell you,  anger is safe.  At times it's called for.  That would make me angry.  Yeah.  Normally under it, I've found that it's fucking normally it's fear or it's sadness or it's  embarrassment or it's hurt feeling.  But that shit is not, as a man, it's hard for me to control that.  You motherfuckers, that's easy to control because I'm a man that's anger. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  But the smoke screen, it's like when my girlfriend pisses me off, like, you know, that dummy,  she really hurt my feelings when she didn't like my glasses.  But I was angry at her.  I was like, I fucking cunt.  I was mad, but I was really hurt.  I was embarrassed.  I felt stupid and ugly.  Like, you know, she hit a soft spot without me.  Aww.  But you guys didn't because you're my fucking guy friends.  I thought it was hilarious.  I don't fuck you.  So I don't care what you think of my physical being.  And that's what hurts me, Jimmy.  Of course.  Are we sharing?  Yes.  My fianc√©e made me feel really stupid last night. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, no.  She said that my sweatpants smelled.  Did you smell like ass?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  I think she laughed a little.  Holy shit, what are you doing?  She's a 10.  She really is a 10.  And you got fucking ass-smelling sweatpants on.  You ought to be in the shower like every hour.  She embarrassed me.  And I walked off to the bathroom to scrub up.  Holy shit.  And I threw the sweatpants away. 
[03:09:30]  That is embarrassing.  And the Philly crew was up.  The Philly crew was up.  And three or four of them were on the couch.  And my girl and me were watching football.  And every time I got up, people were like looking around like, what the fuck?  Oh, no.  And then.  Someone must have said something when you were away.  Probably.  And then Kenny, Lindsay's brother, was a huge fan of Ron and Fez.  He doesn't like us?  I think they like Ron and Fez a little better.  Noon to three.  Right here on 202.  The Philly crew loves Ron and Fez. 
[03:10:00]  They came up just for the winter carnival.  He has that attitude.  And then he finally, I kept getting up and he goes.  Ronnie.  Did you.  He goes.  That doesn't talk.  Did you fart?  I go, no.  Oh, no.  And all of a sudden I got a whiff, but I'm like, oh, that's weird.  Oh, no.  And then after everyone left, my girl had to tell me that I have stinky pants.  That's fucking embarrassing.  Oh, you had like poopy pants.  You had like a diaper, a diaper on. 
[03:10:30]  Does OB have to be changed?  And then she gave me a little talking to that, you know, because I like to go to the gym and  work out a lot.  And maybe I should, maybe I should have more than two pairs of sweatpants and maybe I should  be washing them.  Yeah.  Washing them a little bit more than I do.  Yeah.  So, Jamie, I can relate.  That's embarrassing.  I felt very embarrassed.  Aw.  When you're sexy, your beautiful girl tells you that there's something about that that's  unsexy and it's embarrassing.  Yeah, man.  But you didn't get mad at her, though.  Like, to me, that's good, though, because you're like, yeah, that's embarrassing. 
[03:11:00]  I'm a dummy.  I get angry and I fucking mask that, that embarrassment or that shame.  How do you do that?  I get fucking mad.  Oh.  And I'm like, I can't, my girlfriend's great at diffusing an argument.  Like, she'll go, look, I just want to work this out and it annoys me because I want  to remain angry because I don't want to tell her you hurt me.  You've really embarrassed me by saying that.  You made me feel fucking unsexy or whatever it is.  Or I feel embarrassed.  It's not masculine to feel that shit.  It's masculine to feel anger or to want to knock somebody in the teeth or want to be brave  if I have to knock somebody in the teeth.  It's not fucking, it's not, it's not masculine to be hurt. 
[03:11:30]  Women are taught that they can be hurt and that's cool, but we're not.  So as men, we feel like faggots when we're unhappy or sad.  You know what I mean?  It's amazing.  That's why women probably fucking have less strokes than we do because they cry with each  other when stupid waiting to exhale is on.  And we do what you do, which is give up and go, I got to go to the toaster.  I do the same shit.  And now my girlfriend laughs because I'm a blubbering fruitcake with movies.  So why don't we, um.  A blubbering fruitcake.  Yeah, but she doesn't care.  She likes that. 
[03:12:00]  You faggot.  I'm the worst.  Oh, that's funny.  But I, why don't we, um, uh.  All sit and have a big cry.  We should go out in the woods nude and play the Vongos.  Let's try to get a big, let's try to get us all crying today.  No.  Yeah.  How do you do that?  I don't know.  We can watch a video or something.  It wouldn't do us for me.  I can cry pretty easily.  Let's get a big, let's get a good cry going.  It is very healthy though.  It really, it simply makes you nose stuffy.  But it's very, it's very releasing all the energy out.  If you play Frank Sinatra, I'll, I'll, I'll cry for everybody and then I'll leave. 
[03:12:30]  Aw.  And then you won't see me for a while.  Crying is a weird thing we have.  Probably a month or so.  Aw.  A fucking weird shame that men have with it.  It's such a healthy way of fucking getting emotion out.  Yeah, but it's just, that's a taboo.  Can I tell you?  Yeah.  For men.  Can I?  You don't, you don't cry.  Can I tell you a, uh, this will make everyone uncomfortable, but I love this in some sick  way.  I love this.  So when I was like first dating Lindsay, well, no, we were dating a while.  I think we were coming back from Philly and she's a huge Frank Sinatra fan. 
[03:13:00]  You might not want to hear this story.  Oh no.  Okay.  And, uh, she had her CDs and I think she had like a Frank Sinatra greatest hit CD and we're  jamming tunes.  It was cool.  It was just one of those things.  Song after song.  I was like, yeah, right on, man.  I'm digging this today.  And then, uh, what was the song that my dad likes?  It was a very good year.  It was summer.  What's it called?  Summer of my.  It was, yeah, I think it's called summer of, uh, autumn of my years.  Something like that.  Yeah.  It's a good song. 
[03:13:30]  And it came on and I was trying to be cool.  Cause I'm like, you know, you know, you don't want to like let your guard down.  I wasn't at that stage.  That's just a sad song.  I wasn't at that stage to totally let my guard down with, with Lindsay, who's now my fiance,  but I was getting there.  Oh, so the song comes on and I'm like, uh, she's, she, she knew right away what's wrong.  I'm like, uh, and I told the story recently on the air.  I said, that's the song my dad loved and would put on, you know, he had a 78 and he'd put  it on in the living room.  A 78? 
[03:14:00]  Oh yeah.  My dad had an, holy shit.  I didn't think that speed was ever used.  My dad had those original 78s, like thousands of them.  I don't know what, if they're worth anything, but he was, he was huge into collecting music,  but he was a bit older than me.  So he had like Tony Bennett and Sinatra and all that shit.  And he would put that on and just enjoy himself and think about his life and sing the song  and stuff by himself.  Loved it.  Wow.  Would do it almost every day.  Oof.  So when I think of my dad, I think of that moment.  Oh no.  He's obviously not around anymore. 
[03:14:30]  Most people know that.  And, uh, so the song comes on and I'm like, oh my God, what to do, what to do.  And she could tell.  And I told the story and she's ready to push like next track.  I'm like, no, it's all right.  Oh, I got it.  Look, I can handle this.  I'm trying to be cool.  I can handle this.  We were coming into the, uh, Lincoln tunnel around the big helix.  Fucking boring.  Oh no.  Fucking boring.  In front of my chick.  Oh shit.  Cause I, cause I'm like, nah, I can't. 
[03:15:00]  Fucking driving.  I'm fucking.  You gotta try to blame it on someone else.  I don't have easy pass.  I hate that fucking Timex billboard.  Fucking.  Fuck the Panasonic jam cam.  Jim Morton.  For God, look at the billboard.  It's a pig in the fucking building.  Were you embarrassed or were you cool that she was seeing you cry?  Nah, I mean, I, before that I knew she, she was definitely,  uh, you know, the chick for me.  Yeah.  No.  So I wasn't, was I embarrassed? 
[03:15:30]  You had to be a little bit.  Maybe a little, but it wouldn't be like the, I was, I don't know what I was.  Obviously sad.  Yeah.  Obviously.  I think in the end it was really cool that I was able to show her that.  Yeah.  If that makes sense.  But, uh, fucking balling.  And then the next track came on, it was like Summer Wind or something.  Like, all right, cool.  Let's get back to where we're having this fun little drive with Sinatra.  Sinatra.  Balling!  Oh, man.  Phew. 
[03:16:00]  That's a toughie.  When I meant by a bit older, I meant a bit older than most, like, dads.  You know, parents, you idiot.  Someone writes, Opie's dad was just a bit older than him.  What?  Why?  People don't fucking listen.  Don't have to listen that close.  You know what I mean?  I mean, if I'm saying he had Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, most, most, uh, most kids  my age, I mean, their parents were into the Doors and the Beatles.  He, my dad just missed that era.  Just missed it.  So that was a moment there.  And I, you know, I'd let it, I'd let the emotion come out. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  I'd let it come out.  I don't avoid it always.  I'm trying to remember.  I can't, I can't.  Yeah.  See, it's all that.  All that I remember is like ghost.  Ghost?  Well, when I was watching ghost and the little tear came out of  Demi Moore's eye.  That made you bawl?  A single little tear.  That made you bawl?  I was like, no, I just got like, hmm.  I was like, what is that?  Stop that.  Why is someone telling me to die in a fire because I had stinky pants and I cried to  the fucking Sinatra?  Stinky pants.  Maybe they're hoping the fire would burn your awful pants. 
[03:17:00]  Hopefully that wasn't the same day.  When everyone at the party smells your ass, those are bad pants.  I've never heard of that, actually.  I have never heard of an entire room full of people knowing how stinky it is.  The family looked at each other.  I was mortified.  I went into the bathtub and I was doing fucking soap scoops over and over and over.  I think I can't, I could barely sit down today.  I was scrubbing so fucking hard.  Didn't you, didn't you smell it yourself?  If you're working.  I kind of did, but I thought it was somebody else. 
[03:17:30]  And I was like, God, that's gotta be embarrassing for that guy.  He's a stinky pants.  Oh, no.  That's what I was thinking.  You.  That's what I was thinking.  Your ass smell, they're trying to eat chips and watch the game and your ass smell is fucking  lingering in the air.  Dude, I've been farting a lot lately and I think it's because I got that Nespresso machine  that Super Agent Bob Eatman got on us, which you gotta bring yours in because you're not  using it.  We can use it for coffee in the morning.  So I'm drinking a lot more milk and I think it's causing horrific farts, man. 
[03:18:00]  Horrific.  Air farts where just that warm air.  Yeah.  I want to try skim milk or lactate helps me a little bit because the lactose fucks me  up a bit.  Is that what your therapist said?  No, no, no.  My therapist didn't care about that.  I don't fire on her.  What kind of milk are you using, Jim?  I said, I said half and half.  And she said, is that an expression for bisexuality?  Oh, yes.  And I said, no, it's not.  One percent.  She said, is that an expression for not committing?  And I got another one from the weekend.  We were all getting, the Philly crew wanted sake and we were getting milk for some cappuccinos 
[03:18:30]  before the big winter carnival and getting some like Red Bulls, you know, just getting  the necessities before going out.  And we're at a corner bodega and there's what looks like a java log on the counter.  So my chick has to ask about the java log and then explains how terrific they are according  to me.  And this guy was like, I don't want to talk to you.  But she insisted on like embarrass me with the java log too. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you had a java log in your sweatpants.  You can't get over that, right?  I really can't get over it.  I've never had people make eye contact over the chips that someone's ass smelled.  Do you have a food, we're on a roll here.  Yes.  Do you have a food that makes your ass leak?  I'm trying to figure out, I'm trying to figure out the food that, not leak, like kind of,  kind of gives you a little cranky ass, a little, uh, sweaty crack or just a gross, but you 
[03:19:30]  can wipe and clean up.  You can clean up nice and an hour later, there might be a little, what can only be deemed as  slight leakage.  Let me tell you this about my asshole and let's, let's, for the record, it's fucking,  you could eat fucking ham and eggs out of it.  It's immaculate.  Did you want me to get cranky ass?  Fucking my asshole, of course in moments I do, but it's rare.  Um, you can basically open my ass and put your nose in there and you'd feel like you 
[03:20:00]  were breathing in sunshine.  Oh.  I mean, honestly, I, my ass is hairless and, uh, I scrub it like a motherfucker.  Here's what an ass needs.  A good scrubbing in the shower.  Yes!  A good scrubbing, soap, the washcloth, the whole deal.  You guys.  Get in there.  Get in there for some action.  You know what?  You guys aren't ready for therapy.  And then.  Sorry.  You're lying.  I'm not.  Not, does, you don't get like.  It's very rare I do.  I can only, it's not, it's kind of like, I like sushi and I think I eat too much wasabi 
[03:20:30]  and I think somehow that breaks down and starts leaking out of my ass.  I don't think anything.  It's kind of like that butterscotch.  Ah!  No, I don't get that.  I don't think anything can leak out of your ass.  And don't say I got a loose ass and all that fucking bullshit.  This is every once in a while, so I'm trying to figure out what food is causing this.  I'm just trying.  And I'm not alone, so someone fucking call up.  Because they said the, the, the chips did it with that, uh, that, that, uh.  Oh, that Alestra. 
[03:21:00]  Aline.  What?  What was that called?  The Aline.  Alestra.  Alestra.  Yeah.  So, this is something that's going on and I'm just asking what is the food that makes  it happen to you?  Well, I don't think I have one.  I mean, but again, I have enough problems.  My asshole leaking isn't one.  I'm not saying that it never stinks.  And then wipes.  The goddamn, uh, uh, like, aloe wipes or whatever they are.  After you do that, you gotta use those.  I fucking.  Do you understand how clean my ass has to be?  I pull hair and I'll put a girl on her back and put my ass on her mouth and make her lick 
[03:21:30]  it.  I'll rub a girl's nose in my ass and I'll say, just, just your nose.  Brush your nose on my ass.  It smells clean.  It's clean.  I would never do that if I wasn't clean.  I would.  Ever.  I'm never self-conscious about my ass.  I would never.  I hope he can just make women pass out on the street, like, using his pants.  That's true.  That's how he kiddaps people.  Like, like.  Puts his switch out of their face.  Water for.  Just dangles.  That's how he keeps crows off the farm.  Just hangs those sweats out in the fucking cornfield.  That is a hell of a story. 
[03:22:00]  Which one?  The fucking pants story of the party.  I can't get over it.  That you're getting up and.  See, we all have these stories, but you guys aren't willing to fucking share.  Are you kidding?  You guys want to be, like, fucking superheroes all the time.  No, no, no.  I've told other stories.  I've never had, like, that happen.  I'm trying to think of an embarrassing moment.  I was mortified.  I don't even think I can look at her today.  Why am I not throwing myself under the bus?  I haven't had that.  Your stories just sound cool all the time, though.  Maybe to you they do.  No, that's not cool at all.  I fucking.  I'm a sensitive little baby. 
[03:22:30]  I was a big crybaby.  I used to cry at the drop of a hat when I was a kid.  Oh, my God, what a little crybaby I was.  That's who I picture when I see you guys, really.  I mean, really.  To the core of who you are.  You're not fucking cool guy and cool guy.  Oh, shit.  You're fucking hide in the apple tree, little fellow, and cry when the spaghetti's on the wall.  That's the core to me.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's fine.  It's good.  I like it.  It makes me like you guys a lot.  Thanks, Jimmy.  This is the first official communique from my fianc√©e that has made the radio. 
[03:23:00]  Oh.  I've only referred to her.  Well.  Dear shitpants.  I've only referred to her, but I've never given an actual communique from my child.  Yes.  She writes, I don't mind the crying or your pants that smell like asshole, but your asshole  leaking is too much.  She's packing.  It's not an actual leakage. 
[03:23:30]  I can't explain it right.  What is it?  Leaving skid marks?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Mm.  See, I'm not saying I've never had it, but it's just rare that I, like, after a sweaty  gym, like, if I'm on the bike or something, forget it.  My asshole's a horror show.  Well, I've been riding, dude, I've been riding the exercise bike a lot at the gym, and I'm  just sitting in my own sweat, probably other people's sweat that's still in the seat.  Oh, yeah.  When I actually went to the bathroom, getting back to the stinky pants, after I was mortified 
[03:24:00]  and I closed the door, two doors, by the way, I was able to close between me and my fianc√©e.  An airtight airlock.  Fucking get smacked.  And I'm like, how bad can these things smell?  Of course you've got to smell now, right?  Did you hold them up to your nose?  Dude, I was immediately, and I'm by myself, immediately embarrassed for my soul.  I was so fucking embarrassed.  And then I'm sitting there in the bathroom going, holy shit, she smelled this.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  What do I do now? 
[03:24:30]  Holy shit.  You know, were you sitting on the couch?  Oh, there you go.  Chris from Ohio.  Hot wings.  Thank you.  First honest fucking guy.  Were you sitting on the couch?  Were you stinky pants?  Yeah, so every time I got up.  Did you smell exactly where you were sitting?  You might need a little Febreze.  Hey, it's a brand new couch.  Just came in.  Oh, shit.  Just came in.  You got ass couch.  You might have to spray that fucker down.  There you go.  Tube steak makes me leak, see?  Tube steak?  I think he means a big hard cock. 
[03:25:00]  I just don't have anything that does that to my ass for some reason.  There's some things that make me fart worse where my ass will stink because I've been farting a lot,  but it's just rare I get that.  Coffee?  Yeah, does that do it?  Thank you.  So people know what I'm saying.  Maybe leakage is not the term, but there is, you know.  Like a sweaty, disgusting food in your asshole.  Ew.  If I get into it, it's like not all your shit is solid.  Of course not.  It's a little looser and like a little more water-based, and some of that gravity's taking 
[03:25:30]  its toll.  That's all I'm saying.  When I eat almonds, my fucking shit, it's like a fucking, a moist pile of shavings.  Oh, God.  And it stinks.  Yeah, we're getting off the subject.  See, duty is a safe subject for boys.  We're very safe.  Fuck you.  Fuck your mumbo jumbo.  I admit it.  I cried.  What else do you need from me, Jimmy?  I want to talk about Anthony, and this poor boy's need to shed some tears. 
[03:26:00]  Because I think Anthony, underneath it all, is a very sweet, sensitive boy.  Oh, I'm very sensitive.  Hold that thought, just because I don't want this to go by, because I've never heard this  before.  Kurt Tran from Canada.  Opi's symptom is called wolf bites.  It happens when you think of shit, and you think you're clean.  Fucking updated.  God damn it.  Wolf bites?  And you think you're clean, but an hour later, a little shit leaks out.  And someone else knows what I'm talking about.  Mike, it says, it's when your butthole spits in your pants. 
[03:26:30]  And this guy says, all right, his ass gets seepy, he'll call it seepy, when he eats cauliflower  or veggie platters with ranch dressing.  So maybe the body doesn't break down some of the condiments that we put in our bodies.  Well, you also got to make sure when you take a dump that you get everything out of  there, because they're sort of like your intestine, and then right at the asshole, there's  sort of a waiting room, where, you know, everything kind of waits to come on out.  And if you leave that waiting room full, you could have a problem during... 
[03:27:00]  ...activity.  All right.  If I'm holding a shit in a long time, my ass could sweat a little bit, and then it  will stink.  Like that, yeah.  But there's no food in particular.  That's more like whatever, if I'm not shitting immediately, that will happen, but it's not  from any particular food.  If you get sweat running down your ass crack, I don't care who the fuck you are, you're  going to be in trouble.  Absolutely.  You've got to get...  Then you've got to clean up and ace whatever clothes you're wearing and throw them in the  laundry.  Sweat down the ass crack.  Not unlike tears, down a little boy's face. 
[03:27:30]  That's right.  Yes.  Back to Anthony.  Very sensitive and very sweet young boy.  Yes.  And I try to still be that.  I think Anthony's a good, good, heavy cry.  Like a blubbering.  Yeah.  How would I go about that?  I don't know.  What do I do?  I think if you sat down in a room with a person who understood...  Do I hurt myself?  No.  I have to bring it on with pain?  No.  Just to be honest.  It comes with things coming out. 
[03:28:00]  Don't you have to write a check soon?  Bring in your checkbook.  Oh, okay.  I forgot.  I cry every three months.  I cry on the first.  Yeah.  It's taking that big, heavy shit.  Sometimes they pinch a little on the way out, but man, it feels good when they're gone.  That's the way it is at this time.  That's what it is emotionally.  It's a big, heavy shit.  Yeah.  What happened?  And it feels wonderful once it's out.  That's funny. 
[03:28:30]  I'm seconds from gagging.  What happened?  That's my communique.  I'm seconds from gagging.  What part?  I don't know.  Probably Anthony being emotional.  Yeah.  It can't be my stinky pants.  I'm not the only one that ever had stinky pants, right?  But here's one from my girlfriend.  Jesus.  Die.  No, I don't fuck you until you take the glasses off.  Swing and a miss.  I get a big chuckle. 
[03:29:00]  She didn't communicate with me because she's asleep.  Thank you.  Jay from Danbury.  He's joining the club.  The Swamp Ass Club.  Maybe we could have Swamp Ass card holders.  Card holders.  We have them for everything else.  I have toilet paper holders.  Hey, oh, my cornhole gets drippy.  Anytime I have chicken soup.  Wait, come on.  These guys are now finally playing.  Ah, fuck.  It went by too fast.  Chicken soup and what?  I need to know.  I have to piss very badly.  Oh, you're getting dick leakage. 
[03:29:30]  I am.  That's embarrassing when you take a leak and you wear a nice light pants and you don't  shake good enough.  And then you walk back out to the dinner table with a little spot of piss on the front  of your pants.  Pull it down your leg and you're still going.  And you realize you never stopped and you're old.  You never left.  Never left your house.  You only pretended to go to the bathroom and you're really conversing with your girlfriend's  family while you're pissing your khakis.  And you're not wearing pants at all.  Exactly.  Just pissing on them.  Just jerking off in front of your girlfriend's family. 
[03:30:00]  Pissing and cumming all over the turkey while they sit in shock going, what is he doing?  I'll bring it back.  Wait, wait.  Go pee, Jimmy.  George from Long Island.  Print up the instant feedback.  It's great during the break.  George, go ahead.  Hey, I want to run a thought process when somebody has people over the house and they're wearing  dirty sweatpants.  Any sweatpants.  Well, it was the morning and I like to sleep in the nude.  So am I supposed to go out to the living room with my nudity in front of my chick's brother? 
[03:30:30]  It might have snowed less.  No, honestly, I just threw something on.  It was like in the morning and, well, morning went into late afternoon because we were watching  football and I still had the pants on.  But it was a snowy day here in New York and no one was going outside.  So I said, what the fuck?  Might as well hang around in my sweatpants.  The other thing, I call that a courtesy wipe.  Yeah.  You have to do your business and you're going about the day and you feel a little burning  going on.  Yeah.  That's a courtesy wipe. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, you need to like.  You got a cake.  There you go.  See, people know what I'm talking about.  Courtesy wipe.  It's more like swampy ass, but most people don't want to really describe it.  So they just say swampy ass.  But what does that mean?  There's some action going on down there.  Something seeping out?  A little seepage from gravity.  Just a little.  Nothing crazy.  You need a tighter seal.  I got a tight seal.  You got to exercise that sphincter muscle.  Try doing some heavy lifts with marshmallows again.  Yeah, maybe the marshmallows did it. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, that might have done it.  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll do some shit next.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[03:32:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  It's a pretty intense style. 
[03:32:30]  And if you do it, you will talk to intelligent beings from other dimensions, for real. 
[03:33:00]  He once told me that you don't have to find who you are.  Just get rid of all the crap you're not, and whoever you are shows up.  Oh, that's kind of nice.  My good friend Sean McShane taught me that.  Chris M. from Oklahoma City writes,  Jimmy sounds like someone who just tried heroin and now wants everyone else to try it.  Jimmy's new addiction, therapy.  Douglas, wow, that could be.  There are people that are addicted to therapy.  But I'm not.  I go once a week, and it's helped me a lot. 
[03:33:30]  I've been going best in general.  It's helped you a little.  All right, well.  If we're all going to be honest with each other today.  It's helped a little.  I think there's been a very positive change in Jimmy.  It's helped me a lot.  Douglas from Austin.  Pizza is my killer.  While visiting New York City, I ate greasy pizza and leaked in my pants while I was sightseeing.  Oh, fuck.  Patsy from Texas.  Opie, my husband gets leaky ass from greasy cheeseburgers or chili.  Opie, you do remember you're marrying an 11, right?  Hey, oh, my cornhole gets drippy any time I have chicken soup and or any cheddar. 
[03:34:00]  It's awful.  That's Jay from Danbury.  That was the other half of his thing.  Tim from Pittsburgh.  Swamp ass is the perfect term.  Happens at least once a week.  No particular food involved.  Even after six wipes an hour later, there's still some seepage.  Bob from Manorville.  Eating chicken soup gives me ass clam.  Ass clam.  That's disgusting.  Phil M. from Clark, New Jersey.  You ever pick the lint from your boxers out of your asshole before you jump in the shower and smell it? 
[03:34:30]  Or is it just me?  The best to do is when you're showering and you dig your fingers in there and you pull away a little rolled up paper that was in there.  I'm like, oh, this must have reached.  Jim from New Brunswick.  Oh, my wife said the same thing to me.  I wear sweat shorts as PJs and she went to put her head in my lap and recalled with a face that looked like someone maced her.  You did.  And Eddie from Boston.  Hooters 911 wing.  Sometimes something about the sauce makes me leak.  Ten mile ride on Route 93 South pulled over five times. 
[03:35:00]  So I'm not alone.  Speaking of the awful sweats.  I gotta make a call.  Jeez, what did you just say, Jimmy, about that?  Because I had something to comment on.  Why what?  The last thing you said.  About get rid of all the crap you're not?  No.  Wait, wait, wait.  That's all the toilet paper.  Let me get this.  Did you wash the sweatpants? 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  Are they washed?  All right.  Don't touch them.  I'm bringing them.  I am bringing them in tomorrow.  What are you going to touch them?  Are they sticking?  She's screaming, don't bring them in.  Don't touch them.  I'm bringing them in tomorrow.  Who's going to have to smell them?  Who's not?  I see everyone on the staff wears them on their face.  Oh, God.  That makes boogie boogie noises.  And don't touch the long johns either.  I forgot to tell those guys about that.  Oh, what's wrong with the long johns?  Yeah, I do hang them around the house on hooks. 
[03:36:00]  They have to air out.  All right, don't touch them.  I'm bringing them in.  The airing out doesn't get rid of the bacteria that reactivates.  All right, good news, guys.  Moisture or heat.  Good news, guys.  Good news.  The sweatpants have not been washed yet, and the long johns that were underneath that  were just as bad, because I forgot to tell you, I like to be warm in the winter, but  I also like to work out.  So I had long johns and sweatpants, went to the gym, and rode the exercise bike for about  an hour.  Wait, so the sweatpants that they smelled were over the long johns? 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  So the long johns have to be nuclear, man.  I got good news for everybody.  I got them.  They haven't been washed yet.  Good news for everyone.  Who's that good news for?  Fuckin' it.  Everybody listening.  Hunting dog in case you go missing, maybe.  Everyone in studio.  Oh, basset hound.  Yeah.  Go find him, boy.  Boop, boop.  Very good news.  Yeah.  Good news for everybody.  How do I bring him in, though?  With a stick? 
[03:37:00]  With fucking Snoopy running away from home.  Over your shoulder.  You would have to put those in multiple plastic bags.  It might be too personal if I make interns smell my sweatpants.  No, it won't be.  What are you talking about?  You should make them smell you while you're wearing them.  No.  What's his face there?  Pat Duffy?  No, no.  Jared.  Big boy made a duty.  Jared.  Jared.  Oh, Jared's back, right?  Jared's back for a couple days for the Christmas break.  All right, Jared, is he here today?  Yeah.  All right, tell Jared.  Jared.  It's Jared.  Look at Jared. 
[03:37:30]  Jared's back.  Hi, Jared.  Hey, Jared.  Look, it's actually good to see you.  It kind of is in a weird way.  Look, you're like, I almost fell off.  Stupid asshole.  He tried to sit down and almost fucking hit the floor.  Yeah, he didn't realize that the chair with wheels would move when he pushed his ass into it.  Sean from Monroe, New Jersey, I get the ass leaks from the garlic butter saw.  Garlic butter saw.  I love the garlic butter saw.  Who doesn't like the garlic butter saw?  They're my favorite.  You have to just almost get the seat out. 
[03:38:00]  Garlic butter saw.  Jared, you're going to be smelling my sweatpants tomorrow, and it's good to see you.  Okay.  Thanks.  Okay.  I'm looking forward to it.  Where is he?  There he is.  He's a good boy.  How have you been?  I've been great.  Are you famous for Big Boy Made of Duty?  Yeah.  And the duty hat?  Yeah, I actually, I was walking down the street in Syracuse, and this kid walked up to me,  and he's like, holy crap, it's you.  It's Cream Pie Jones. 
[03:38:30]  Cream Pie Jones.  Yeah, but you were replaced by Pat Duffy.  It happens.  All right.  So what have you been doing?  Are you interning at our Syracuse affiliate?  Yes, 95X.  Do they like us up there?  Yes, very much.  They do?  Yeah.  You can be honest, I don't care.  No, yeah, Alexis and Jim, Jim's the guy who does board op, likes you.  Alexis loves you guys.  Right.  Is she hot?  Oh, wow. 
[03:39:00]  What have you been doing?  Maybe you don't like girls.  Is she hot?  She's attractive.  That's a no.  I've been doing production work.  Production work?  Yes.  And you're up there for school, though?  Yes.  Ah, so you're going to school?  Yes.  Okay, and what do you do there?  I go to Syracuse University.  What do you do?  Everyone just goes, they go to school.  I don't know what everyone...  No one knows what the fuck they take in school anymore. 
[03:39:30]  It doesn't matter.  The thing is to be able to brag about the school you go to.  It doesn't actually matter about what you do at that school.  It doesn't matter what you're going for, what you're looking to achieve once you leave  that hallowed...  Dude, you can basically be a janitor.  ...hallowed halls of...  You can be a janitor that's sweeping the classrooms out at Syracuse University, and people go,  what do you do?  I go to Syracuse.  But you're going to a job, but they don't have to know that.  Yeah.  And you're cool, because that's an impressive university.  How about this?  Let me ask the way the young people talk.  All right.  What subjects are you taking, and how are your marks?  I am... 
[03:40:00]  How are your marks?  Are you getting high marks?  Grandma, did you get promoted?  I'm a psychology and anthropology major.  Psychology and anthropology?  Yeah.  That's interesting.  And you're like, well, what are you doing with the radio thing?  Well, my whole logic was...  Excuse me.  Let me interrupt you for one second.  I wasn't.  No one was saying, what are you doing with the radio thing?  Failing miserably at it.  We're not a fucking class that you're giving a motivational speech to.  No.  You might be saying...  You're all looking at me going, hey, what is this guy doing?  All right.  Now I'm going to tell you. 
[03:40:30]  Yes.  What's this Jared's infomercial?  Why am I putting a shit hat on?  Well, funny you should ask that, God, and everyone else on the planet.  Now, what's with the anthropology?  That seems like I had a left field for you.  I am...  Trying to find out what you are.  I took anthropology of American life through literature and film.  Oh, my gosh.  What?  Exactly.  Really interesting course.  What is interesting about that?  Because we read a book called Culture Against Man. 
[03:41:00]  It was written by a guy named Jules Henry.  He's a douche.  But what was the gist of that that was so interesting?  It's that you see it.  You don't notice these things, but they exist.  And it's just...  Like what?  The interesting part of this chat?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I thought anthropology was more the classic anthropology.  Well, there are several different fields of study among anthropology. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  Archaeology.  Uh-huh.  There's linguistics.  There's ethnology or cultural anthropology.  Oh, of course.  They ought to throw that one in.  Make everyone feel good.  Then there's applied anthropology.  We all know who tried to get that course and put in the schools.  And then there's what, the last one?  Applied anthropology.  Applied anthropology, which is like just all sorts of different...  Anthropology you use on a daily basis.  Like when you write a check or go shopping.  Or like CSI.  Oh, CSI.  Oh, he told you.  See, that's interesting then. 
[03:42:00]  Talk to Anthony like he's a dope.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I wouldn't know.  I didn't know what anthropology courses were like.  Man, there's so many of them.  And how are you going to use that in your future?  I don't know.  Ah, see.  That's what everyone says.  That's what I was getting at.  You don't know what the fuck you're going to do with your life.  Well, my whole logic is that I have none.  Logic.  Well, sometimes you start off doing something in college and it doesn't necessarily designate 
[03:42:30]  the career path you're going to follow.  Oh.  Like my mother, for example.  She was a communications major.  Oh.  And now she...  Didn't tell you to get closer than three feet away from the microphone?  And now she's dead.  Oof.  No.  Sorry.  Sorry.  There's my meanness coming out because I hate you right now because I'm bored.  I could always leave and do something else.  No, no.  Go ahead.  I like you.  Trying to figure out a little bit about Jared. 
[03:43:00]  What he's been doing since he's been gone, I thought maybe, perhaps, after a few months  of being away at a school, he'd have some fun stories and adventure.  I'm trying to pull it out.  And he has nothing.  I sensed something here and I just got to go on record.  I'm not bored because of your participation in this.  You did your job.  Trust me.  It's this zero that has nothing.  Anyone that goes away from it for a few months, you would think, would have something 
[03:43:30]  of interest to bring back to the people that he worked with?  I used to, but this semester I kind of became a homebody.  Ew.  You got agoraphobia?  I just didn't feel like going out.  Oh.  It was cultural anthropology.  Anxiety?  How close are you to killing yourself?  Not very close.  No.  Why don't you leave your house?  I just didn't feel like going.  I was really tired on the weekends.  You're an odd bird, Jared.  Is there a part of anthropology that an elder would come back to the village and discuss 
[03:44:00]  what he did out there in the wilderness or something?  Maybe linguistics?  No.  No?  No.  Nothing like that?  You should walk around with one of those long sticks on your cock.  Yeah.  Like the tribesmen of the Kalahari.  What is the definition of anthropology?  It's the study of humankind.  Uh-huh.  Mankind.  Stop being peaceful.  So that wouldn't apply?  That's what they say in class.  Who cares what they say in class?  A guy coming back to a village after being out and experiencing life and then somehow 
[03:44:30]  communicating that to his people isn't part of anthropology?  I guess it would be.  Holy mother of fuck.  How much is your tuition?  A lot.  How much?  How much is being wasted?  40 grand a year?  Wow.  Awesome.  40 large.  I'm going to be paying that back the rest of my life.  Oh, motherfucker.  You're going to owe $160,000.  You could open up a nice little anthropology shop and make your money back. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  Sell theories.  Has your mom kind of given you any hints that she realized that it's such a waste of time?  No.  Oh.  Grades good?  Yeah.  A's?  What's your average?  3.2.  3.2.  That's a A.  That's a B.  It's a low B.  A little over a B.  That doesn't look good, though, on a, you know, transcript, a college transcript, does it?  You're going to be sniffing my underpants tomorrow.  Yeah.  My long johns, which are long underpants, and my sweatpants. 
[03:45:30]  The sweatpants, worse than the long johns, though.  These are the sweatpants.  The sweatpants weren't washed.  I just thought about it for at least two weeks of workouts.  Just kind of lazy.  An entire family smelt ass from these.  Yeah.  Just in casual passing.  Now you are going to hold it right up to your nose.  It's okay.  Okay.  All right.  You got no problem with that.  And then we'll talk to you more. 
[03:46:00]  All right.  That's all.  Yeah.  More about your fucking anthropology.  Jimmy, I never got to go to Chinatown, and I think that it has affected my life.  Aw.  No.  You can go whenever you want.  Yeah, but I was a kid at the time, and I was looking forward to the trip.  Well, those little things do haunt us, but...  And my mom took us all out of school.  We were going to go down to Chinatown, the big day in the city, and we were going to  have Chinese food and buy Chinese stuff.  Buy back scratchers. 
[03:46:30]  Whatever.  And it was going to be a nice day in Chinatown, and we got all excited, woke up early, and  packed our little bags and our little lunch boxes for Chinatown.  And then my mom's best friend, who's a raging alcoholic, obviously died one on the night  before, and was too hungover to help my mom bring us all to Chinatown, because there  was about five to six of us, and my mom had to break the news that we weren't going to  Chinatown.  And I never went to Chinatown, Jimmy.  You should go.  And I think that affected me. 
[03:47:00]  It probably did.  That's just a little thing that guides us and makes us the people we are.  Sure, it makes us resentful of people with afflictions, which would make me resentful  if somebody was a drunk.  Mm-hmm.  If they cost me a day trip like that that I've been looking forward to, it fucking makes  us prepared for little heartbreaks.  Well, the excuse, she was sick, you know.  But you knew.  But we knew.  We knew what sick meant back then.  Alcoholism.  That was her sickness.  We're going to Chinatown now.  We weren't allowed to go to Chinatown, and we were going to reschedule.  Guess what? 
[03:47:30]  We never rescheduled.  So take your girl and go and look at the stuff you would have looked at.  Why not?  I'm 30 years old now.  Give or take a few.  A couple of years.  Give or take a couple of administrations.  I think you should go to Chinatown.  See, there you go.  I share.  So I would tell a therapist that, now what?  Now what happens?  It's not just about that.  It's about being in an environment where you really...  See, that's a thing.  That's not a risky thing to talk about. 
[03:48:00]  Whatever it is that you're scared to talk about, which we all have those things, which  not we're scared like people will know, but they're hard to bring up emotion, or they  bring up real sadness.  Not the bullshit.  I'm mad at the guy I work with.  Shit.  That's easy stuff.  It's like the stuff that really...  Like, who I am.  Like, that type shit.  When all the nonsense is said and done.  Deep-seated.  Sure.  Of course.  Anchored in there.  Of course.  Blue Healer from Kentucky writes, didn't get to go to Chinatown, but Opie got to go to 
[03:48:30]  Funky Town.  All right.  Everyone's looking...  I got Jimmy on the camera with his glasses, and they're all saying, you look adorable.  Thank you.  They're all being very nice.  I look like a fucking...  An egg-headed clod.  No.  No.  Let me see.  Look at this.  Who fucks me?  I'm looking at my head right now across the thing. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  Oh, there's one person that says the Dalai Lama.  I don't know what...  Oh, the Dalai...  Looking like the Dalai Lama.  I'm actually not that bad.  Without the thing...  Like, if I do like this and I talk, I take them off, I can't see shit.  But that's what...  That's how I talk when I talk therapy.  Oh, you take your glasses off occasionally?  You make a point?  And I do this to make a point.  I close the one piece.  Like, the one ear piece.  Yeah.  And I put the other piece in my mouth, and I go, my earlacks tastes shitty.  I shouldn't do that again. 
[03:49:30]  No, you shouldn't.  I like looking at myself on the monitor.  I look like a dignified gentleman.  Yeah, look at you.  And I put my hood on, and I try to recapture...  Oh, look.  Little red riding fat pig.  I fucking...  Look at my neck.  Yuck.  Well, don't pull it like that.  You can't pull yours, because you have a slender man's neck.  Look at me.  I should be going to grandma's house to get liposuction.  Fucking fat-net cunt. 
[03:50:00]  Jimmy was grabbing his fat in the middle of us having fun over at the other joint, and  he just went...  I didn't mean to.  It was off mic.  No one saw it except me.  I didn't mean to, but I just like...  I think I was the only one who saw it.  I'm like, what is he doing?  We're in the middle of having fun.  I just looked at my stomach.  He pulls up his shirt and squeezes his fat and goes...  You lost a lot of weight.  You just need toning.  Thank you.  I certainly do.  Yes.  Like a veal.  I need a lot of toning.  Can I deliver that more Vordelian?  Toning.  Like a veal.  I gotta go.  Let me tell you.  I gotta do something.  Aw. 
[03:50:30]  At noon.  Therapy?  Oh, wow.  Look at what time it is.  No, therapy's Wednesday.  Wednesday.  I canceled it two weeks in a row because I've had things to do.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  Yeah, it was that important to you.  Well, look, again, like I said, I make it.  I'm not, you know, obsessive.  Yeah.  Not an obsession.  Why don't you just lose that mumbo-jumbo shit?  It's helpful, though.  Mumbo-jumbo.  I find myself more willing to not fight with my girlfriend when I know...  It's harder to do shit when I know that I'm doing it. 
[03:51:00]  Mm-hmm.  First step is to own it.  First step is to own it.  For real.  If you know you're doing something, then you can keep from doing it if it's bad.  Or it's harder for me to be comfortable doing it, which is, again, a step.  Like, if I'm with her, and there's times where I stay mad and I know I want to be mad.  Like, she was sending me these nice texts once she knew I was bothered.  She's like, look, you know I love you.  All these nice things, but I didn't want to respond.  I was attacking because I was angry, but I knew I was angry at that.  It's very childlike.  Yes, it is. 
[03:51:30]  Especially through a text to attack like that.  Yeah.  We're going to...  Did you use little initials for things?  No.  You spelled out the word.  See?  I was...  But I realized I like that feeling.  That feeling of being hurt.  I like it.  Why do you like that?  I don't know.  That's weird.  It reminds...  I don't know.  I hate that.  That feeling of being hurt or left.  I like that feeling.  You like that?  That's how I'm comfortable in that painful feeling is. 
[03:52:00]  Because you're feeling something.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah.  Maybe that's what she said.  She said you do that because you need to feel something.  And you can't feel the other stuff like happiness and contentment with yourself.  So you just like feeling what you can, which is hurt.  Oh, that's sad.  I feel like I don't deserve good things.  I know you feel that way.  Yeah?  If it really feels that way, yes.  Oh, jeez. 
[03:52:30]  Spit on the board, Joe.  All right, I feel like I don't deserve good things.  Let's end the show.  You fucking creep.  Get rid of this mumbo jumbo.  You're scaring the shit out of me.  No, it's okay stuff.  You're a very good guy.  You're a very sweet guy.  Even when you're cranky, you're a very sweet guy underneath.  I've spent enough time on the road with him where he's a very sensitive guy.  Shh.  He can be loud and break your balls.  I'm not loud.  Shut up.  He's a very sensitive guy. 
[03:53:00]  Shut the fuck up.  Hidden under that cranky-ass exterior.  Exactly.  Hidden underneath that fucking garbage scow he calls an asshole.  He's a very sweet guy.  Hey, there's a great linger-longer coming in.  Chris from Ohio.  Hidden underneath the fucking gulls circling that fucking West Shore Expressway he calls underpants.  That fucking... 
[03:53:30]  Old Staten Island sweats.  Hey, they're coming in tomorrow.  Wow.  I'll find out if my fiancee truly loves me because if she threw him in the washing machine...  A worser.  That means she doesn't truly love me.  Hidden underneath.  She's got to allow those to make an appearance on the show tomorrow.  That fucking stable you call an anus.  He's a very gentle and sweet boy. 
[03:54:00]  That fucking slaughterhouse.  That fucking...  Hidden beneath that August day on the corpse farm that you call a pair of long johns is  a very kind man.  Dude, don't be fooled.  The long johns aren't as bad as the sweatpants.  Long johns only had about two days for me to kind of like marinate in.  Yeah.  Marinate.  Oh, that's wonderful.  It's the sweatpants that will knock someone down tomorrow.  Yes.  Hidden beneath tank one at the sewage treatment plant. 
[03:54:30]  Right.  Hidden beneath that fucking Mike Rowe season finale.  Mike Rowe's going to do a dirty job.  We're going to launder Opie's sweatpants today.  Wow.  This is a bad one.  This is really bad.  This was a great linger longer.  Opie didn't go to Chinatown, but he did get to go to the uncle's burnt out house.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, legend of the fall. 
[03:55:00]  This is a story we're obsessed with.  I know we're getting ready for the line of the day, but the window washer who survived  falling 47 stories.  Yeah.  I've been reading everything about this fucking guy, and he's still alive.  He's now moving his hands and his feet and trying to open up his eyes.  He's in a coma.  He's still in really bad shape, but he's alive, and this happened well over a week ago. 
[03:55:30]  So, Jimmy, we figured he fell around 470 feet because you said 47 stories times 10, right?  No, it was over 500 feet.  It was closer to 550 feet he fell.  Now, his brother got killed.  They both fell at the same time.  His brother hit a fence and was split in two, dead, dead on impact.  This guy, whose name I can't pronounce, was hurtling downward at a speed of 124 miles an hour.  Nice.  He was clinging to a 1,250-pound scaffold that acted like a surfboard in the sky. 
[03:56:00]  That's the only thing they could fucking figure out.  Somehow that was like, you know, surfing the air a little bit.  A little bit, because it's still fucking falling.  Yeah.  Those grappling with why he miraculously survived his plunge from the roof of a 47-story high-rise  say the aluminum platform added air resistance that slowed his descent  and blunted the tremendous force of hitting the concrete pavement in an alley below.  Experts said a random air current, they're thinking this could have happened, 
[03:56:30]  a random air current rising between the Upper East Side buildings where Moreno plummeted  slowed him the extra bit that spared his life.  50% of people who fall four to five lousy stories.  What are we on, the fifth floor right now?  Yep.  Falling right there, right, Ant?  Outside your window.  50% of the people who would fall out that window behind Anthony would die.  We should do that with two interns.  Have them jump out and bet on which one lives or dies. 
[03:57:00]  Because of 50%.  That's, all right.  Yeah.  So 50% from five stories, ready for this?  By the time you reach 10 or 11 stories, just about everyone dies.  So they're like, how the fuck is this guy still alive?  He landed in a tangle of cables, and the pictures in the paper, it's just like, I mean, just looking  at, oh, he landed, okay, this is kind of key to, he landed in a tangle of cables and bent  railings that may have broken his 500-foot-plus fall or absorbed some of the shock.  Yeah, anything to absorb some of that shock. 
[03:57:30]  So he landed on some shit.  I mean, 500-foot fall.  It's amazing.  If it was a 20-foot fall or an 80-foot fall, a 500.  And then it says, in a free fall, both men would quickly have hit a maximum speed of  125 miles an hour.  That's terminal velocity?  Absolutely.  Or terminal velocity.  The point when gravity pulling a person down is balanced by upward air friction.  But the scaffold's platform likely slowed this guy down significantly by pushing the air,  he said.  His landing position also could have made a huge difference. 
[03:58:00]  They're trying to, they're thinking he might have laid down on this thing to distribute.  I mean, he wasn't doing it to distribute.  He was panicking and holding on, sure.  Yeah, so he's like, fuck, and he laid down.  He had a little bit of time to think like, wow.  No, he wasn't thinking.  What do I got to do now to maybe make it through this?  No one's thinking.  I think he just kind of.  I think that's a long enough fall where you're actually going, I'm falling.  I think if you're, you know, five stories up, by the time you actually have a chance to  think about it, you're already on the ground.  The last part of this, if he was lying flat, not only would the scaffold act as a shock absorber, 
[03:58:30]  but the force to stop him would be spread more evenly over his body.  If he came down on one point, the sudden shock could easily break the back or neck.  Yeah.  So they're still trying to figure this out because it's just amazing.  It was God.  It was God.  It was the miracle from God.  It was the finger of God.  Finger of God.  All right.  I think there was something else, but yeah.  But fuck it.  Let's go out line of the day.  All right. 
[03:59:00]  Line of the day brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  It's college.  Hell yeah.  Bowl season.  Put your football skills.  Put your football skills to the test with Bodog Fantasy.  College pick-em contest.  Register for the contest in the College Bowl.  Public Prize League with your Bodog account, and you could win up to $100,000 by picking  games correctly.  BodogFantasy.net.  That's right.  The fine people at BodogFantasy.net.  Yeah.  I don't know why your mic was so low during that.  You sounded very enthusiastic here. 
[03:59:30]  What?  Here's a long runner-up line of the day.  Stupid coroner's going to throw them in the garbage.  Of course he will.  Yeah.  Get these off her.  I got a job to do.  He'll remove them from her feet with like a bat.  Swat them off with dead feet.  Because they're a little stuck because of her swollen feet.  He'll pick up an aluminum bat and Louisville slugger those cheap shoes off.  He's a little slugger.  Oh, get the Frank Sinatra song.  I'm not going to listen to it. 
[04:00:00]  It's been standing by, I think.  All right.  We'll play that, though.  They should have played it before.  No, because I don't really.  I share it, but I'm not going to.  Well, you would have just said turn it off.  No, I'll just leave.  We're off.  You'll hear the song that gave me a damn good cry, and that is what reminds me of my pops,  who was an amazing man.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Separate holidays.  I don't think that's going to.  Last minute separate holidays.  I don't think that's going to happen.  Why?  Bring your pal talk and you'll be there in spirit. 
[04:00:30]  They didn't.  They didn't.  They could put a pal talk screen where you would be sitting at the table, and there you are.  It ain't going to happen.  You could even eat the same meal from the comfort of your warm mansion.  That was more of a little bit.  Anthony staying at a hotel while his girl is at the house with the kids.  At the house with the family.  And her mother and everybody else.  Yeah.  Here's another runner-up line of the day. 
[04:01:00]  When Dan Fogelberg wrote about his cabinet-making father.  Uh-huh.  I'm making a good living doing that, I'd imagine.  You probably forget to put handles on it.  Right.  All stoned.  There's a cabinet that's all nailed in.  No door.  Giant piggy bank for plates.  They just crash and break when you drop them in.  Slot.  Rotten cabinet maker.  Yeah, it looks like dear old dad didn't pay attention in school.  His cabinets suck.  You forget to put bottoms in them.  If you put your plate, it just falls through. 
[04:01:30]  This guy's cabinets blow.  He should die.  And he did.  Oh, that was so good, Jimmy.  Just going off on fucking cabinets.  I forgot about that.  Ten minutes.  How do you make cabinets funny?  Jesus Christ.  That was very funny.  I'll say that I did cheat, though.  Because whenever there's a dead guy attached to him, you know, that's always the ace in the hole.  Yeah.  You can always go after him and his legacy if you have to. 
[04:02:00]  Oh, God.  What are you trying to conjure up another pair of pants?  Is that it?  Let's go home.  What?  It's another runner-up.  Oh, another runner-up.  Is this the last one?  No, I think this is the last runner-up.  All right.  One more runner-up line of the day.  Her shoes are all, her feet are all dehydrated, so he's got a shore like a horse and a few nails in there.  Oh, that was Dan funny.  That was Dan's line. 
[04:02:30]  Aw.  That's why I liked it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you cheated.  Why are you making faces, Jimmy?  I'm trying to have a lick.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day, line of the day, line of the day, line of the day. 
[04:03:00]  That's embarrassing when you take a lick and you wear a nice light pants and you don't shake good enough,  and then you walk back out to the dinner table with a little spot of piss on the front of your pants.  You're on your leg and you're still going.  And you realize you never stopped and you're old.  You never left.  Never left your house.  You only pretended to go to the bathroom and you're really conversing with your girlfriend's family while you're pissing your khakis.  And you're not wearing pants at all.  Exactly.  Just pissing on them.  Just jerking off in front of your girlfriend's family.  Pissing and cumming all over the turkey. 
[04:03:30]  While they sit in shock, going, what is he doing?  He's too.  Holy shit, that E-Rock sound.  Choking E-Rock is a great ending.  All right, learn something.  Never sharing again.  Why?  I talk about really smelly, horrific fucking sweatpants and I don't get no acknowledgement in the runner-up lines of the day. 
[04:04:00]  No more sharing for me.  Going back to a board up.  That's what I do now.  But I don't think that was line of the day material.  All right, board up now.  I think that was more...  I go back to pushing buttons.  What do you think of that?  Apples.  How about if we said line most likely to draw fruit flies?  All right, we're going to end the show.  The line of the day from the front opening where you piss from to the fruit of the loom label.  Mark of the day.  Mark of the day.  Brown line of the day. 
[04:04:30]  Fuck you, man.  Those sweatpants are coming in tomorrow.  They're going to be a hit, I tell you.  A hit.  I'm putting my coat on because we're going to end the show differently today.  You're going to have to evacuate.  Well, you can go to the Zeppelin channel, which I'm fucking loving and we haven't acknowledged on this show for some reason.  Channel 59, man.  In between us and Ron and Fez, you should check it out.  It's a fucking amazing job they're doing with that.  I think Lou Brutus put the whole thing together.  It's amazing.  Fucking amazing.  The Zeppelin channel. 
[04:05:00]  59.  Coat's on.  Yeah, you are ready to go.  So, this is the song that my dad really dug and this is not good for me.  But we'll play this today in whatever.  Memory of my dad.  Whatever you want to think.  And you leave because I don't want to see any emotion out of you.  I would never fucking cry in front of you.  Play it.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  I want to discuss.  No.  No, you got to go. 
[04:05:30]  Oh, that's a sad horn.  When I was 17, it was a very good year.  It was a very good year for small-town girls.  Oh, shit.  I'm just going to try to go with it.  All right.  No, get the fuck out of here.  You know, I want to talk to you about it. 
[04:06:00]  I'll be serious.  Please.  We'd hide from the light.  He was very sad.  You get stuck.  All right.  Thanks.  When I was 17.  All right.  Shut this off.  No, I'm kidding.  Turn it off. 
[04:06:30]  Don't do dare.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  It was a very good year  It was a very good year  For city girls  Who lived up the stair  With all that perfumed hair 
[04:07:00]  And it came undone  When I was 21  When I was 35 
[04:07:30]  It was a very good year  It was a very good year  For blue-blooded girls  Of independent means  We'd ride in limousines 
[04:08:00]  We'd ride in limousines  Their chauffeurs would drive  When I was 35  But now the days 
[04:08:30]  Are short  I'm in the autumn  Of the year  And now I think  Of my life  As vintage wine  From fine  Older cakes 
[04:09:00]  From the brim  To the dregs  It poured sweet  And clear  It was a very good year  It poured sweet  And clear  It was a very good year 
[04:09:30]  Hey, this is John C. Reilly  And you're listening to  Opie and Anthony  Goofy gags  To plan your uncircumcised pals  Funny things to do  With foreskin  One was you put  Fucking a little  A little crazy glue  Around the rim  And you put it  Around an exhaust pipe  The foreskin  And you drive away  Fucking pull the skin aside 
[04:10:00]  And dump rock salt in there  Clean that out  You fucking baboon cock  One was itching powder  And the fucking thing  And then you staple it shut  On top  Dirty fucking European dick  You stand a fucking  Uncut guy against the wall  And you put  You lay on your back  You put your feet  On his thighs  And you grab his force  And you lift both hands  And you pull it up  To your chest  And you let it snap  Like a window shade  And it will actually  Make the noise  I have to fill that  Skinny fucking  Fleshy pouch  With crushed glass  And I'm gonna fucking  Smash my fist out  Goofy gags 
[04:10:30]  To plan your uncircumcised pals  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Hit the bricks  Crusader dick </pre>
