<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a "Chipperson Thanksgiving" featuring a visit from Jim Jefferies.  The hosts relentlessly teased Jefferies about his intense phobia of bananas, repeatedly showing him one despite his visible distress, causing him to briefly leave the studio.  Jefferies also shared a traumatic childhood experience involving molestation at Cub Scouts and subsequent physical abuse from his mother. A listener called in to confirm the banana phobia.  After returning, Jefferies elaborated on his aversion and mentioned a fear of vacuum cleaners.

The show then transitioned to an interview with George Carlin.  Their conversation covered Carlin's long career in radio and stand-up, his staunch views on free speech, his criticisms of American society and media, and the rise of political correctness.  Carlin shared anecdotes from his career and reacted humorously to news teases from local newscasts.  A caller praised Carlin's routine about the f-word, and the discussion touched upon baby boomers, a Dennis Hopper retirement commercial, and Carlin's observations on America's declining international image.  He also commented on the potential demographic shift due to differing birth rates between Muslim and Western populations.

Next, the show featured an in-studio conversation with Ricky Gervais, along with Louis C.K., Ron Bennington, Jim Norton, and Jay Moore.  The discussion was filled with offensive jokes and vulgar language, revolving around weight loss (including the differences in British and American measurement systems), Gervais's HBO special "Talking Funny" (featuring Gervais, Louis C.K., Jerry Seinfeld, and Chris Rock), and an awkward interview Gervais had with Gary Shandling.  They extensively discussed Gervais's show "Idiot Abroad" and Karl Pilkington's unusual personality and behavior, speculating about a possible autism diagnosis.

This segment continued with a discussion largely focused on comedy, interspersed with talk about investments (specifically gold coins) and the differences between British and American humor. Opie and Anthony proposed a "Fool's Gold" TV show concept. Gervais delivered an offensive rant against the English.  The comedians compared their comedic styles (Gervais, Chris Rock, Louis C.K., and Jerry Seinfeld), debated the nature of comedy (empathy vs. jokes, need for personal problems), and discussed the Marx Brothers.  Stephen Merchant joined, focusing on the differences in UK and US comedic timing and cultural references (including the word "cunt").  They discussed the internet's impact, the changing nature of celebrity, and the differences between the British and American versions of *The Office*.

The show then featured an interview with Stephen Merchant, mainly about his projects, including "Life's Too Short" (featuring Warwick Davis, Liam Neeson, Johnny Depp, and Sting) and a particularly funny scene with Neeson doing improv. Merchant discussed his stand-up, influences, and comparisons between American and British comedy styles. He also talked about *The Office*'s David Brent and his work with Karl Pilkington, sharing humorous anecdotes from "An Idiot Abroad."

Ron White joined the conversation, discussing his career, experiences with other comedians (Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall), his appearance on the Imus show, and the challenges of performing in different environments. He shared stories about his tour bus and his difficult relationship with his manager, who he described as a "genuine asshole," recounting incidents of the manager's sabotage and White's response.  He also mentioned a high school principal being fired for showing a clip of his special.

The show concluded with a segment featuring Dane Cook, Bill Burr, and Bob Kelly in studio. The conversation included vulgar banter, jokes about hair loss, a lost videotape of early stand-up performances, and criticisms of improv comedy. They shared stories about difficult audiences, bad food experiences, and their time on the comedy club circuit.  This portion also involved a detailed and graphic story about a comedian with a skin condition, numerous jokes and insults, and references to Matt Malley.  The final segment included reminiscing about teenage sexual encounters, a guest's documentary about his WWII veteran father (including anecdotes about his father's confrontations, behavior, and an encounter with Paula Abdul), and stories from the set of a film with Clint Eastwood, including descriptions of Eastwood's use of racial slurs and other unusual behavior, as well as interactions with Harvey Keitel.  The show ended with holiday greetings.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This holiday weekend, we're proud to present their most memorable appearances.  I took his hand and put it in.  Oh my god!  And bringing it all to you is a man of razor-sharp wit.  A man who knows funny.  His mother says so.  Double guns, motherfucker.  This is a very Chipperson Thanksgiving.  What's that?  Here's your host, Lyle Chip Chipperson.  It's day two.  It's a Chipperson Thanksgiving celebration.  We're playing a bunch of appearances by comedians on the Opie and Anthony radio show. 
[00:00:30]  Not counting myself.  Because everybody says it like my comedy is the best and stuff.  And I always come up with the good jokes.  But you know, some other guys had some good ones too.  Like this is Jim Jefferson.  Jim Jefferson reveals he's afraid of bananas.  So of course we have to find out why.  I was never scared of bananas.  I remember one time I heard my mother yelling from the other room. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, Lamar.  Stick your big banana deep.  So I guess they was in there having daiquiris or something.  I don't know.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  My mum, I had a friend commit suicide a while back.  I'm telling you it's a cheery thing.  But I had an argument with her before she committed suicide that day.  I rang my mum up and I go, I said some awful things, mum.  And she goes, well, James, in your life you're going to say hurtful things to people that you don't mean. 
[00:01:30]  But you just try to minimize these things so they don't happen again.  And she goes, I'm just happy.  I've said some awful things in my life.  But I'm just happy that I never said anything bad to you or your brothers.  And I'm like, what did you do when you left the house?  Were you just like stabbing people in the street or something?  Last time I was home I got woken up by this 400-pound woman bashing into my room going,  I want you to know that when I'm dead in many ways you've been a huge disappointment to me.  And the reason for that is because I didn't show her some photos and I showed them to my dad. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, she's mental.  She used to beat the hell out of me.  I got scars on my foot.  Really?  She used to hit me with a belt buckle from a scout belt, right, because I wouldn't go to scout.  The reason I wouldn't go is I was being molested every day I was there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  She goes, why won't you go?  I don't want to go.  Boom.  You must have been an adorable little kid.  Now it explains all the stories you told us yesterday.  Yes, it does.  Right, Jimmy? 
[00:02:30]  That is stupid.  Now we understand why you do what you do sexually.  I had MySpace messages just a row of 20 when I got back to the hotel yesterday that just said,  Gay.  You got molested at Boy Scouts?  I had Scouts, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he never actually physically inside or anything.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah.  Well, was that all right, you think?  Yeah.  Probably not.  He used to just put me in a corner.  Anyway, it wasn't a good day.  Either way you look at it.  It wasn't a good day either.  What would he just, was he into just looking at you? 
[00:03:00]  The thing is, he always wanted you to call him Baloo through the whole experience.  He never lost his, you know, seniority from the Jungle Book.  What did he make you do?  You got to kind of keep it like sort of vague.  But we'll figure it out.  A lot of swearing and sitting in the corner.  And it was like being in the front row at SeaWorld.  Oh, no, okay.  What did they do?  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Oh, God. 
[00:03:30]  When Shamu flips up in the air and lands in the air.  Caution, you may get wet, is what they say.  Yeah, when Shamu.  That was the best way I could describe it on Boy Radio.  I thought that was pretty good, the way I danced around there.  Wow.  Oh, God.  So this was going on at Scouts.  You go home, and now you decide, you know, it's in my best interest not to go back there anymore.  It was Cubs, actually.  And now you're getting beat by your mom. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Because you won't go to Scouts to get molested, basically.  Mom used to thrash me with the belt buckle of the Scout belt.  When the hell did this happen?  And those Scout belts, they're like those big buckles and everything.  It wasn't nice.  In the end, my dad found out.  I tell this a little bit in my routine, but I'll mention it anyway.  In the end, my dad found out.  I swear to God, this is what he said.  He comes to me, and he goes, I went with my mate, who it also happened to, and my dad said, 
[00:04:30]  you've done the right thing by coming to see us, and I want you to know that you've done nothing wrong,  and he's done everything wrong, and he's going to get what's coming to him.  And then my dad hugged me and looked at me and went, I wonder how you got all those badges.  And people think I made that up, but I swear to God, that's true.  And the thing is, I respect my father so much for that, because I believe comedy is all about taking risks.  And my father was holding his molested child, and he thought, no, it's a good one.  Have a go.  Maybe I'll get a joke here. 
[00:05:00]  I'm just going to let this one fly.  I'll just work it in.  Did you laugh?  No, I didn't really get it.  I can promise you, later on that evening, he was in the pub with his mates going, and then I said.  Let's say good morning to Cleveland.  We got Pete on the line.  Pete?  That is true.  Pete, what's up?  Dude, that's awesome.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  All right.  I've been lingering longer, and you guys were playing, I don't know, it was when you were on vacation or something,  they did a replay, and Bob Kelly was in the studio with you guys, and he was talking about, 
[00:05:30]  he did this set, and there was this guy that was in the waiting room with him that was like,  deathly afraid of something, and it turned out it was Jim Jefferies.  This was a long time ago, and I guess you guys all forgot about it.  Hmm.  What is he afraid of?  Bananas.  Oh, yeah.  No, I don't.  I don't like bananas.  In fact, there's a pill over there that I've already.  How did you?  How did you?  No, don't do that.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[00:06:00]  No, no.  Seriously, it's open.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't screw with him.  Wait, what is this about?  He's actually leaving the studio.  I don't like bananas.  I don't like bananas.  I'm just holding up the...  Are you doing a bit?  No, I'm serious.  Put it back, Opie.  Don't make the guest uncomfortable.  No, don't put it back.  I don't like it when it's open like that.  Like this?  Yes, don't do that.  All right.  What is going on?  Put it back, and we will ask, and maybe there's an explanation. 
[00:06:30]  Wait, this is like kryptonite.  Look at this.  Watch it.  No, don't make our guest uncomfortable.  Don't open up.  No, seriously.  It's not funny.  Wait, do those things open look like what a Scoutmaster's trousers look like?  All right.  Put it back.  Put it back.  Hold on.  It's got to be said that I just...  He saw my banana over here.  I eat a banana and yogurt every morning.  This guy just said that he's deathly afraid of bananas, and he pointed at my banana.  I picked it up.  I just started showing it to him, and he's moved away. 
[00:07:00]  How did that guy know I didn't like bananas?  Who told him about bananas?  I guess Bob Kelly had said it once.  Wait, this is a real moment.  What's up?  I have a thing with bananas.  All right.  You're going to tell us after the break.  This is the tease right now.  Wait.  Who's turning off the channel right now?  If I shut my eyes, I can't see it, so do what you want.  You can feel it, though, right?  No, no, no, no.  Just feel the banana.  No, I'm not going to touch the banana.  Please, just feel it.  I'm not going to touch you.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Why would you do that?  How weird is it, though?  Look at him.  He doesn't like.  People don't like balloons. 
[00:07:30]  Some people don't like baked beans.  Some people don't like clowns.  I don't like bananas.  How does it make you feel when you see it, though?  It used to make me vomit.  Now it's just like someone holding a spider to an arachnophobe or something.  Well, it looks like a spider because it's all like flayed out.  No, yeah, yeah, yeah.  When it's open like that, it's like.  Why are you doing that?  Because it's an amazing reaction.  Leave him alone.  I've gotten better.  A year ago, I couldn't even be in this room.  In the room?  No.  You barely could be in the room.  You're like moving away from the mic.  When did you realize that there was this?  Ever since I was a child, I never liked it. 
[00:08:00]  Wow.  You know what the banana represents?  Who are we kidding?  Who are we kidding?  I can't have a squirt gun with milk shooting out of it.  Brr.  You're being very cruel.  It's his kryptonite.  He doesn't like that.  Yeah, but see, my problem is now, because he wrote Robert Kelly, he tells everybody, and  some guy in, I don't know, Wisconsin or something rings up and tells me that I don't like bananas.  I thought it was a fairly well-kept secret.  And now there's going to be like people at the show tonight just with a banana, just sitting 
[00:08:30]  on their knee, just in the front row.  Have them thrown out.  Oh, yeah.  If you bring a banana, you will be thrown out of the venue.  I once shagged a bird, you want me to say that word?  Oh, sure.  Okay.  I once shagged a bird, and she put a condom on, and it was banana flavor, but I didn't  know, and it was banana.  I vomited all over.  With that artificial, the artificial smell of just, you don't even like the smell of  banana.  So you don't like any banana flavor?  Let's just see what happens.  Just hold this banana. 
[00:09:00]  I'm not going to hold it.  I'm not going to hold it.  It just ain't going to happen.  Hold my banana.  Something happened.  Did the scalp...  No, no, I was, yeah.  No, no, but I mean, is there a...  No, no.  Was I molested with a banana?  No, no.  By breakfast or something, with that smell.  It's a visceral reaction.  My mom said even as a baby, I wouldn't eat, like, mashed up bananas.  Really?  I remember my brothers used to hold me down and mash banana into my head.  Oh, what bastards.  Yeah, but I didn't like it before then.  They would do that because you didn't like it, and that wasn't the cause of it. 
[00:09:30]  They weren't mashing bananas into your head.  That's what they told your mom.  Child protective services.  That's right.  Grrr.  Grrr.  Grrr.  Yeah, I didn't do that.  Grrr.  Grrr.  Opie, why are you being such an ass to our guests?  I'm just showing love, man.  We love this Jim Jeffries guy.  The guy...  How would you like if someone brought a vacuum in and just started vacuuming around you?  Don't you like vacuums?  Bit over.  Bit over.  He hates vacuums. 
[00:10:00]  Anthony figured out a way to make you stop.  Why wouldn't you like vacuums?  Bit over.  Bit over.  The sound of a vacuum drives him nuts.  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  Nuts.  My mom would vacuum our house, I don't know, hours at a time, and we'd be watching TV and...  And when they found that out...  Lift your feet!  Listeners would start calling, listeners would start calling, and over the phone, just play  them the vacuum sound, and it would freak them out.  Dude, I'm lucky... 
[00:10:30]  Exhaust fans in, like, bathrooms, it's the same sort of sound?  No, it's just vacuums.  I'm lucky enough now in my life to have a cleaning lady, and she comes once a week, and she was  vacuuming the other day.  I had to leave the apartment.  Really?  I had to leave the apartment.  All right, see?  Look what it does.  I love that sound.  It smells good.  That's my thing.  Yeah, I like that sound.  And just like you, I don't know why.  It can't be just because my mom was vacuuming a lot as a kid.  But look at my arm.  Goosebumps right away from the sound of a vacuum. 
[00:11:00]  Can I feel them?  Yeah, here you go.  Ooh.  You know what...  That was very sensual.  What the hell, Jimmy?  You know what gets me?  You know what the air hose on a compressor?  Use it, like, to clean off.  If you work in a shop, you use it to blow off sawdust or metal chips off a lathe or something  like that.  To put it a little too close to your arm and hit the air, and it, like, makes your skin  go, like, a little bit.  That, I can't even deal with that. 
[00:11:30]  How often does that happen?  Well, you know something?  In the...  When you're working a shop, it happens a lot.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, because you're, like, cleaning stuff up.  You used to do that?  Let's see.  And just the air coming out of the nozzle kind of gives me the heebie-jeebies.  I'm sadistic, though.  I will do a bit where we get a lot of vacuums, turn them on all at the same time.  I want to see how many vacuums I can take before I actually have to leave the studio.  Right.  Because I will leave the studio eventually.  I bet one.  I don't think one.  The one makes the goosebumps pop up immediately in the hair on the back of my neck.  But, you know, and someone is reminding us we're missing the obvious here. 
[00:12:00]  What?  Maury.  Maury fears.  Maury fears.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you would be perfect on Maury Povich.  Yeah.  Because he has people confront their fears, you know, to help them.  Whoa.  Whoa, the banana's getting loose in my hand.  Don't.  Whoa, it has a life of its own.  Whoa.  You know something?  Whoa.  Jim is.  Stop it, will you?  Stop it.  Whoa.  This isn't even good radio.  Stop it.  People at home are already bored of this.  This is boring.  Jim has been nothing but a great guest on our program. 
[00:12:30]  And you're rewarding him by being a douche.  I won't vomit or anything.  I'm all right.  My ex-flatmate put a banana in my underwear drawer and I punched him in the head.  You punched him.  And I made him wash all my underwear as well.  It's weird because you look down.  Like, you can't make eye contact with the banana or the person that is holding the banana.  You kind of look down and shy away from the microphone.  Watch.  Whoa.  Oh, would you?  Why?  It's that little flinch that a dog gets that you've hit a lot. 
[00:13:00]  That's what I say.  Yeah, that's exactly what you look like.  No, no, no.  No, don't give it to Norton.  I'm actually just going to give it to Norton.  Don't.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  You can't watch people eat a banana.  No, the whole density of the thing and they chew it.  Jimmy, let's eat our banana.  And they chew it.  Oh, my God.  Why are you doing this to this man?  Jimmy, we won't.  My mouth is thick with the banana.  Oh, my God.  They're so untested with the banana.  I'd rather eat big-eyed tongue.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I thought you said that.  Hey, Jim. 
[00:13:30]  It's too thick.  No, see, look.  He's going to leave.  He's going to leave.  See, he's going to leave.  He's leaving.  It's just a...  I'll be back.  Just finish your banana.  It's delicious.  Holy crap.  This is a real...  He just left.  Dude, this is not fake.  He doesn't like bananas.  He's thick and banana-y.  Next time he comes to New York, we have to have a studio filled with bananas.  Quickly, Joe.  I was...  Hundreds of them.  I had a smoothie yesterday, and it's, you know, banana, heavy banana and strawberry, but 
[00:14:00]  it smells like banana, and he was kind of sitting, like, in the seat next to me.  I wonder if that was bothering him.  Oh, this sucks.  All right.  We like him too much.  Wait, let me finish my banana.  He's been a great guest.  You don't want to have him not come back.  I'm not having a hissy fit.  I'll be back.  Just finish the bananas.  What?  I can't hear you.  Just finish the bananas.  Could you walk to that mic?  I can't hear you.  I'm not being a girl.  I just...  Oh, he's got the banana peel just cocked back in his hand like he's ready to heave it at 
[00:14:30]  him.  You are so mean.  He's giving us such great radio, too.  Jimmy, are you done with your banana?  I certainly am.  Oh, hi.  No, Jimmy's put the banana peel on his head.  Look, we'll make it fun.  We'll wear them as little banana hats.  All right?  All right.  Jim, look.  Look what I do for you.  No, I'm serious.  Don't dangle it, man.  What?  Even this?  I'll start swearing when we take it off the air.  You don't want this. 
[00:15:00]  Leave him alone.  Do you like Jimmy's banana hat?  I like Jimmy's...  It's a banana hat.  Yeah.  Coochie-coo.  That is weird.  It's not nice.  Jimmy, you got one of those things?  Mine is vacuums.  His is bananas.  Ants is air hoses or whatever.  Do you think I would tell you?  I have one and I would never tell you.  You got one?  Oh, yeah.  Isn't it an innocent thing?  Kind of.  Heterosexual sex?  Isn't it an innocent thing?  See, mine's...  Like the laugh of a small child? 
[00:15:30]  Oh, I got something for you.  Thank you, Ther.  Thank you, Ther.  Hmm.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  There's no word.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  No, it's still holding it open.  So appealing.  So appealing for us to get together and sing.  Sing!  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding.  Banana phone. 
[00:16:00]  It grows in bunches.  I've got my hunches.  It's the best.  Beats the rest.  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  You're a bastard.  I'm doing the dancing banana.  That's a soft wine.  Banana phone.  Pick wine.  Woo!  It's no baloney.  It ain't a phony.  My cellular, bananular phone.  All right.  Jim.  See?  It's in the bin.  Listen, listen. 
[00:16:30]  There we go.  All right.  It's dead and buried.  It's in the garbage.  Did you get Norton's one as well?  I threw mine out.  Oh, okay.  All right.  We're okay.  I'm sorry about that.  And now people think I'm an idiot.  I have another one.  But I do enjoy a good banana.  I like to eat them.  Yeah.  I know people, too.  It's a superfood.  It's a superfood.  It's full of some vitamin that I obviously lack.  I have potassium.  You've never had a banana?  No.  No.  No.  That's so weird.  All right.  We got Big A in the studio.  Someone offered me about $500 once to eat a little bit, and I vomited.  Well, could you do that for our radio show next time you're in town? 
[00:17:00]  That would be terrific radio.  I would need much more money than that.  Would you ever take a gig?  That was when I was poor.  At Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  That's a funny question.  Would you ever take a gig at Bananas in Poughkeepsie?  I can handle the word.  Yeah?  There's big bananas hanging.  It's fake.  Oh, yeah.  They're fake, but they're fake.  You can do that?  I used to have one of those blow-up bananas that you rode in the pool with.  Oh, really?  Like a pool pony, but I was cool with that.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So you're not completely insane.  It's just actual bananas.  I can't go to Queensland, though.  Up in Queensland, there's just banana plantations everywhere. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, wow.  I'm walking through it, and the tree's attacking me all the time.  They're not trees.  They're like bamboo-y type things.  Yeah, banana, whatever they are.  If you were drowning, and the only way to reach you was with a banana, would you grab it?  What do you mean the only way to reach me?  Like you're just out of hand's reach.  Oh, yeah.  So you're saying a banana, this is going to happen, is it?  The only way to reach me is banana.  You haven't got an item of clothing that you can chuck off with your hand. 
[00:18:00]  You're naked.  You're only holding a banana.  You couldn't stick your leg out instead, which is longer than your arm.  You're just out of leg's reach.  You've got to put a banana between his toes.  The banana.  I love how this guy is.  Geoffrey's rules.  We really do.  I would tell you that use your leg, or use your shirt, or something like that.  Because then I know, even if you save me, then on the boat, going back to the big boat,  you'd just be baiting me with a banana the whole time. 
[00:18:30]  It's true.  And that would be uncomfortable, going, who saved you?  Who saved you?  Just have to jump in the water again.  What's that?  More unforgettable appearances from the biggest names in comedy coming up.  This big world, this big round globe, is theatre in the round to me.  I'm just here for the show.  A very chippers in Thanksgiving will continue on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Now, more legendary O&A appearances from our favorite stand-up comics. 
[00:19:00]  A very chippers in Thanksgiving continues.  George Carlin!  This is the last appearance of George on the show.  I didn't think he was very funny.  I didn't get his stuff at all.  I didn't like that.  The seven dirty words.  I say them all the time.  Shit, cocksucker, piss.  We were talking about, I guess, his 50 years of doing comedy and his radio and stuff and free speech.  And he talked about his HBO special.  And he said something about, like, Chipper, I think that you're the guy that should carry the torch or something with comedy. 
[00:19:30]  I don't know.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  We're fortunate enough to interview a lot of people with this radio show.  And every once in a while, someone comes through that door where we're, like, starstruck and a little freaked out.  And you're one of those guys.  And it's only a handful of times this has happened over the years.  Thank you.  Now, calm down.  Right.  We're all, obviously, huge fans.  And we love everything you've done.  I really appreciate it.  50 years, right? 
[00:20:00]  50 years since I went into radio in 1956.  Wow.  40 was just starting.  Rock and roll was just starting.  I was 18.  And I had the advantage of having a car down in Shreveport.  I was in Shreveport, Louisiana.  I was in the Air Force.  And I could go out at night and tell the chick, hey, you want to hear a song tomorrow?  Carl dedicated to you.  What do you want?  You know, it was magic.  Magic, man.  Two paychecks.  Didn't have to do anything on the air base.  Just do my show. 
[00:20:30]  That's why it was just never changed as far as that goes.  That's why most people got into radio was for the free CDs.  Well, free CDs now.  Whatever.  Free music.  And hopefully picking up a few extra women on the side.  And trade-outs with the sponsors.  Right, right.  Yeah, the old plugola and the payola.  Well, radio must have been a hell of a lot different back then than it is now, especially.  Did you have freedom to really talk and say what you want?  You didn't have a PD up your... 
[00:21:00]  It was the first stage of Top 40, so personalities were still in play.  And you had a kind of a persona on the air, and they did set your pictures out, you know,  and all that.  And I was a young guy, so they wanted...  You know, we had a lot of young listeners, naturally.  And so they wanted to have like a fan club and all that stuff.  And yeah, the thing about it was our radio station was a daytime...  Well, dig this.  It was a day timer.  That is to say, it went on the air in the morning, went off in the sundown. 
[00:21:30]  Because that was the way you did it, some of them.  A thousand watt.  And we had to gain our audience back every morning.  And we had a 52 Hooper in a nine-station market.  A 52% share of the audience in a nine-station...  A hot radio market, Shreveport.  They had a big CBS station with Louisiana Hayride.  Had a lot of great radio stations.  And we were number one.  But yeah, we had an owner who hated rock and roll.  But he played it. 
[00:22:00]  But he also played Ray Anthony and stuff like that.  So it was schizophrenic.  And you could choose everything you wanted.  You know, you had 30, top 30.  You had the newcomers.  And then you had oldies and dusty discs and all that.  But it was up to you, you know.  Yes, you could make your own program.  You would pick it.  And then what about like talking between the records to get some of your personality in there?  It wasn't just time and temperature and label and artist.  Right.  It was, you'd talk about whatever you felt like.  And you could play around.  I used to always, any live spots, I always had fun with them. 
[00:22:30]  I would do them in foreign accents.  Or I would do them as characters, you know.  So, yeah, it was a lot of freedom.  Yeah, now, it's a business.  Which, I think, Ope says it a lot when he got into it, even.  You know, it was a bunch of guys just kind of hanging out.  Especially FM radio.  FM radio, they hired you because you smoked pot.  No, I'm serious.  And like the album-oriented rock stations in the 70s, especially, they hired you because you were one of the guys. 
[00:23:00]  And you would smoke pot and play whatever the hell you wanted.  And then someone figured out, whoa, we can make money off this.  That's right.  Which turned out to be a bad thing in the end.  They called it underground radio for a while.  Sure, it was underground radio.  I used to listen to old air checks.  And you hear these guys, they're completely stoned.  Looking out the, I mean, you hear it on the radio.  They're like, oh, I'm just watching the snowfall.  They're just completely gone.  And this was CMF. 
[00:23:30]  I got to listen to some old air checks.  And then you fast forward a mere 10, 15 years.  And there's consultants.  And there's PDs running in.  And the general managers.  And it's a whole different, you know, ballgame now, unfortunately.  They test everything.  And they send out hooks.  Yeah.  They actually have people listen to hooks to see which hooks they have.  They don't bother with the whole record.  You like this whole section?  Okay, that's a good one.  Yeah.  If you like two seconds of this song, our station's going to play it.  How ridiculous is that?  I know.  And I was one of the guys when I first started radio, I was the guy that had to play this 
[00:24:00]  little hook for people at home while they were trying to eat.  You did that.  I was an intern.  That was my job.  Yeah.  And I would just fudge the results because half these people would be cursing me out,  saying, F you, I'm eating, don't ever call again.  I'm like, all right, they like the song.  Is that a yes?  Yeah.  Right on the air.  So, you know, and the consultants would take all this research seriously, but they would give  it to interns to do.  Of course they're not going to, you know, work that hard at doing that.  Well, it's just, it's just another sign of the absolute disintegration and decay of this 
[00:24:30]  country.  It's been in its death throes, you know, since World War II.  It's on the way.  It's going away, man.  People think it's going away.  If you can't smell that, if you can't see that, you ain't paying attention, man.  You've said a lot of things that have been really controversial with some people, and  that's, that's one of them.  I happen to agree with you.  Yeah.  I think we're doomed as a nation.  We're going to go down in history as one of those empires that kind of peaked and then 
[00:25:00]  kind of went away.  Overreached.  Yeah.  Selfish.  Arrogant.  Ah.  And have, and now we have things like, uh, tequila lollipops, you know, and I counted  I, in the, in the car wash, about a year, a couple of years ago by now, I counted of  all the ways you could change the smell in your car from things you hang on the window  to beads, to sprays, to, they had several delivery systems for this stuff.  I counted over 200 different things you could do to change the smell in your car, and one 
[00:25:30]  of them was called new car smell.  And, I mean, it's over.  It's finished.  Take a look, you know?  One of my favorite things is, like, as the years have gone on, you're less good at hiding  your revulsion for everything, which is what's so, it's great.  Thank you.  I love it.  As it's gone on, it's just gotten, like, just angrier and just less trying to be polite  to them and just assaulting the people that are actually sitting in the room. 
[00:26:00]  And, you know, I want to just, if I may, for a moment, correct the word anger, even though  it's an understandable word to use when you describe some of that stuff I do.  It's really a disappointment and a disillusionment and a contempt for people, this country and  the human species, either one you want to take, the American nation or the human species.  We were given great gifts.  This mind, this brain that we have as humans and the wonderful gifts in this country.  And we have squandered them, made all the wrong choices, organized ourselves poorly. 
[00:26:30]  We believe there's an invisible man in the sky who's running things.  And all we want is the latest gizmo.  We want a cell phone that'll make pancakes.  If we can get that, we're going to be fine.  And it's just absurd.  And what it is, it's frustration.  You know, it's not an anger.  You intensify it on stage and it reads as anger.  I know that, but I don't live an angry life.  And I look at this and it's an amusement to me.  This big world, this big round globe is theater in the round to me. 
[00:27:00]  I'm just here for the show.  And you got an outlet.  You could go on a stage and kind of spew what you're seeing out there.  And we have an outlet.  We get to do a radio show and we point out a lot of stuff that's going on.  You have the immediacy going for you.  You can get right on it the next day.  I think I would go insane if I wasn't able to just like go on the radio and talk about  all the craziness that's happening around us.  I really do.  We were talking about the news and how it has just deteriorated from, you know, when I was 
[00:27:30]  growing up as a kid, you'd see Walter Cronkite on the news.  It was a desk.  It was a clock.  It was Walter.  And you pretty much believed him.  You know what he was saying?  You felt he wasn't trying to pull something over on you.  Whether he was getting accurate information or not, he was just reporting the news.  He never got up and danced.  I never saw him get up and dance.  He never needed flashy graphics.  And he never teased what was coming up next with some kind of deadly disease or there's 
[00:28:00]  a toy in your house that could kill your child.  We'll tell you about it in four hours as your kid plays with toys.  It's just this thing, this business to get people to tune in and keep tuning in.  It's an entertainment show now.  I once heard a 7 o'clock news tease that said, prominent senator, no, it was during the  entertainment hours.  It was during primetime, like 8.30, something like that.  They said, prominent senator dies, find out who at 11. 
[00:28:30]  You know?  I wrote it down.  It was so funny.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Hey, you know, we have to play some of these news teases for George.  I think he would really appreciate it.  Oh, a couple of the Hall of Fame ones that we picked?  Yeah.  We make fun of the local news and they're news teases, right, George?  Yes.  And you might want to put the headphones on so you can hear this or put them close to  your ear there, whatever you want to do.  I got it.  I'm not going to tell George Carlin what to do.  This is the thing to tell me what to do.  Yeah, but what we do is we collect all the news teases that come into our show and then  we make a Hall of Fame of the best of the best so far, okay? 
[00:29:00]  We've only been doing this about two years and I think we've got like six.  We'll play a couple for you, like this one.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  All the sex offenders, three-block area, right next door to you.  Right next door to you.  Three-block area.  Small city.  That's fantastic.  And who wants, who's running on that platform?  Yeah.  Like who wants to do that?  We will have the sex offenders. 
[00:29:30]  Every one of them.  One three-block area.  That's great.  Then you got this one.  How a twist on the predator law could shut down religion.  Let's hope so.  Yeah.  Please.  But just one little twist and that's it for religion.  That's it.  That's all it's going to take after all these years, right?  Complete anarchy.  Could frequent hiccups be a sign of cancer?  Watch News 8 and 10.  That's on the money. 
[00:30:00]  It's always that fear of your health.  And the music, they got, that's the exorcist music.  Yeah.  Is it?  Like playing underneath.  It sounds exactly like tubular bells or something playing under there.  We can't get enough of this, George.  Here's another one.  Are you normal?  Thursday at 11 on News 8.  Are you normal?  Don't go by us.  What a set on these idiots.  Doesn't that sound like something from Kentucky Fried Movie or SNL, but it's really the news.  We only got a couple more real fast. 
[00:30:30]  Could your house be making you fat?  Tomorrow, CBS 2 News at 5.  We collect these like baseball cards.  They are just too much fun to own.  And we take it very seriously.  We debate it on the air.  Should this one be in the Hall of Fame?  We're not sure.  Yes.  You know, it takes a lot to get to the Hall of Fame.  And the ingredients in shampoo that can make a boy develop breasts.  Tonight at 10.  Give it to the girls.  Send them to the neighborhood with the sex predators.  Might as well play it out.  We got two more. 
[00:31:00]  Go, go, go.  Sex offenders may be in your house.  In your house?  Especially if you're one.  Right.  And then finally.  The problem solvers of uncovered sexual predators sent to live in our nursing homes.  Do you really know who's living down the hall?  Could this happen to your mother?  Just the thought.  You sure they're not making fun of themselves.  They've got to be at this point.  Just the thought of your mother being ravaged.  That's pretty much what they wanted you to get.  Your mom's laying in a nursing home, barely breathing, and being ravaged by some predator. 
[00:31:30]  By some predator that you didn't know about in the hospital.  What a great project.  When did it happen?  It's like, and I talk about the downfall of the society the whole time.  I'm constantly saying we're doomed.  We're doomed.  But I don't know what did it.  Is it the nation as a whole with getting greedy?  Is it just the leadership?  Is it political correctness?  The world just opening up and getting more info? 
[00:32:00]  It used to be kind of us against the Soviets.  But then when information started being spread a little more easily, they kind of figured out what was going on.  I don't know.  No.  But it is depressing and just disappointing.  It's kind of entertaining when you look at it, though.  You know, when you're born in the world, you're given a ticket to the freak show.  When you're born in America, you're given a front row seat.  And some of us have notebooks.  And that's as simple as that. 
[00:32:30]  You and all of us in this room, we have notebooks.  And we make little notes.  Some of the freaks are self-appointed.  Michael Jackson, Mike Tyson.  Certain ones.  Other ones are thrust into it.  Leona Helmsley.  It's just an interesting thing to watch.  I mean, from the standpoint of personalities alone.  But I don't know.  I think it's a cascade, you know.  Yeah.  It builds on itself.  And they say, hey, as you say.  It reminds me of a line from Fireside Theater. 
[00:33:00]  Hey, we can make whiskey.  You know, hey, we can make money, like you said.  Once they find out there's an extra dollar or two to be squeezed out, they do it.  Yeah.  You have this great.  I'm sorry, George.  You have a great knack of taking the way people are thinking and just really making you doubt your own point of view.  Like, with voting, it's such a brilliant point you made about how people say, ah, you can't complain if you don't vote.  And then you point out how, like, the people that voted are the ones that put these people in office.  So you have every right to complain because you're not a part of it.  You stayed home that day.  Of course I'm complaining. 
[00:33:30]  I didn't do this.  It wasn't my work.  The greatest ability to narrow everything down to one simple, beautiful point, like anorexia.  I think it's probably my favorite thing you've ever said is anorexia.  Rich C's don't want to eat.  F them.  Yeah.  I mean, what a beautiful, accurate thing.  I had a friend in my neighborhood, Jack Heaney.  We call him Billy Heaney.  He was Bill John.  And he had that reductionism.  He could do that.  And I sort of, like, liked that.  And I think I must have picked some of that up from him. 
[00:34:00]  He had a way of looking at something and really presenting it to you in bare bones.  And, of course, he went into a different field, but I was able to use it in my field, you know.  It's just a way of not BSing yourself, looking at the thing and saying, hey, wait a minute.  What is this really?  Oh, yeah.  Here's what they're doing, you know.  Why did stand-up become so likable-oriented, too?  It's really, like, annoying how they're focusing so much on people being likable and people being, like, sweet and kind of cuddly for an audience. 
[00:34:30]  In what respect?  Where?  Well, just like on television, it seems like they just want to take, like, the balls out of anything.  Oh, yeah.  Especially stand-up performance-wise.  Well, I think everybody's running really scared.  And I think any voice that sounds a little scary to them is going to be neutralized or compromised.  Yeah, it's just, it's a stupid, if you're talking about commercial television, forget it. 
[00:35:00]  Commercial anything.  I mean, that's all it's about is selling goods.  All that other stuff, nothing, the stuff in between doesn't mean anything.  It's just a delivery system for sales.  And you're not going to get anything worthwhile in between the selling.  You've been linked to the FCC now.  I mean, forever, you will be forever linked with the seven dirty words.  Which is now 700, by the way.  But it's gone so far beyond that now because now we don't only have to adhere to FCC regulations. 
[00:35:30]  We have to adhere to nice regulations.  We have to, it's political correct little interest groups that'll, like Reverend Al Sharpton and people that will just fire off some letterhead to your boss.  And they will then give you another list of words that you can no longer use on the air.  This disgusts me.  Sure.  It completely takes your balls away. 
[00:36:00]  You can't do the show you want to do.  No.  Once advertising is involved, once the cash register comes into play, everything else is subordinated to that and has to be.  Unfortunately, that's just what they do.  But I just think it doesn't, it would never pan out to where the advertiser really would have to worry.  Like, like you say something on the air.  A group comes up and says, all right, we're going to boycott. 
[00:36:30]  I would love for someone to go, go ahead.  Let me see if this affects, you know, Coca-Cola's bottom line at the end of the year.  Let's see how far this really would go.  But they get so scared.  We're talking about the IMA situation, obviously.  Like, you know, when you do a radio show, you follow the FCC guidelines.  You have to.  You're going to get fired and get the company fined.  But now, like Ant said, it's not about that anymore.  You have to now be nice on the radio.  You can't offend.  You can't offend a Rutgers basketball player, woman's basketball player. 
[00:37:00]  People think they have a right to not have their feelings hurt.  They actually think that's a given right that the forefathers wrote in that said, your feelings, they can't be hurt.  And that is, you could say whatever you want as far as hurting someone's feelings.  They could come back at you and say something else.  That's that left-wing paternalism.  Big white daddy knows best. 
[00:37:30]  That came, you know, everyone, we all got to understand that we could expect censorship from the right wing.  Over time, we know that's where it's going to come from.  But to expect it from the left wing, from the politically correct people in the campuses, especially the Eastern Ivy League campuses, that caught me by surprise.  I mean, isn't that the guys, the people you grew up with that were going to, you know, really change things and, you know, had this freer thinking? 
[00:38:00]  And then it just turns out to be a bunch of phonies, just like you said, paternalistic.  The conservatives have always hid behind, like, family values and religion.  And it seems like what the liberals hide behind is things like hate speech.  Like, that's how they get you to kind of not say what kind of smashes their ideology.  Yeah, it's this this country went off the cliff and it's just in free fall now.  It's just, you know, that we're waiting for the for the Big Bang to happen.  And it's so wonderful what nature is doing to smack us back. 
[00:38:30]  This this this arrogant species who overbuilds, overreaches, overuses, wastes, just completely lays waste and despoils everything it touches.  Three wheel vehicles, all terrain vehicles.  We're going to go everywhere.  There's some sand.  We're going to make a mark and we're going to make an ugly mark.  And then we're going to not worry about it.  We're going to come home and we're going to barbecue.  You know, it's just a sick, it's disgust in my voice. 
[00:39:00]  You're hearing.  You had a great take on the beheadings.  Everybody's like, oh, how horrible they are.  And you said the beheadings when you said, F them.  Stay out of another man's country, Jack.  I'm like, God damn it.  That was a good point.  You don't go to Iraq.  You don't get beheaded.  So now you know that.  Put that on your list of stuff.  Stuff not to do.  Yeah.  What a great thing to say, though.  Again, boiling it right down to the simplest of things. 
[00:39:30]  Simplifying it.  That's why when I hear you say something like the big invisible thing in the sky that people.  Well, we did a whole bid yesterday, you know, the Harry Potter books being banned because  there's wizardry and it's not good for the kids.  And then Jimmy made a brilliant observation about, you know, our own Jesus Christ there  and the wizardry that was involved with that story that was quite similar to some of the  stuff you're reading in these Harry Potter books.  Yes.  Like walking on water, changing water to wine, healing people.  It's wizardry.  You're not Lazarus. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  You know, you're not dead.  I'm doing a bunch of stuff you're going to like in this next HBO show.  The final part, the last 12, I don't know how long it is really, is a series of things  on civic customs and civic beliefs and slogans and things that I question and that I never  have believed in.  But basically, I'm talking about questioning them.  I'm not trying to reject them outright.  I'm holding them up for question.  Proud to be an American.  God bless America. 
[00:40:30]  Swearing on the Bible.  Taking off your hat when the flag passes by.  The last one is rights.  The fact that you really don't have rights.  You know, they're imaginary.  Rights are, they're like the three little pigs.  They're like Pinocchio or the boogeyman.  We made them up.  We made that up.  You know, we have 10 rights in the Bill of Rights in this country.  Britain has 13.  Why is God changing numbers on people?  The Germans have 26.  The Swedish have 29. 
[00:41:00]  I have six.  The Belgians have 29.  Why would God give different people in different countries different numbers of different rights?  So, again, it's that reduction to the obvious, you know.  And it's a wonder.  I just love when I get to that part of the show because I know I'm going to have a lot more fun even than what has come before, you know.  Well, I walked in and I saw George in the green room and I went, my favorite thing he's ever done is, you are all diseased.  It's just, just to me, I can't stop watching it. 
[00:41:30]  And you close, a live HBO special, and you close on a bit how there's no God.  And you say that at the end of the show, like the bit's very funny.  And at the very end, you're like, there is no God, never was, not one.  And I'm like, what balls?  You close a live HBO special saying that.  And I think I said, and if there is a God, may he strike this audience dead.  And then I put it on myself and I said, see, you know, he's afraid.  He don't want to kill me or whatever it was.  It was such a great, great way.  It's a lot of fun to throw it down in front of them and then step across it, you know. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, let's get right back to it.  We got George Carlin in the studio.  We don't want to waste a minute with George.  Can I say one of my favorite things is that I was just thinking in the break.  You've never become pompous as a comedian.  Like, I love so much the fact that your subject matter.  I mean, it's by far the most brilliant social commentary any comic's doing.  But then there's also like silly things and fart jokes.  It's never become too hip for the room.  It's just whatever is funny to you.  Yeah, the room was never hip anyway. 
[00:42:30]  The room was always lame.  I was always hipper than the room when I was a kid.  Yeah, George could go real deep and real silly.  Like, your whole thing on moving and stuff and that whole – I love that bit.  There were three areas – actually, four areas now that I kind of draw from.  Language itself, just for its own sake, talking about words and phrases and stuff.  Words hurt, George.  We had to read a pamphlet here to do our radio show, a whole pamphlet.  I didn't mean to interrupt you, but you just brought up some that – 
[00:43:00]  I'm just not understanding what you meant.  I think you would appreciate this.  That's why I jumped in here.  With the political correctness and stuff, they handed out this pamphlet about how words hurt.  It's called Words Hurt, and we had to read different stereotypes and how they're used and we shouldn't use them.  We're at a point now on regular radio where I can't go into Chinatown and speak to somebody  and then convey the conversation here using the accent of the Asian gentleman  because an Asian group will write in and say, I'm doing a stereotypical accent. 
[00:43:30]  No, I'm imitating the guy at the store I was at.  You can't say that.  I could go to any other store and go, yeah, I was talking to a salesman, and he said,  well, that shirt looks a little big on you.  That's right.  I could do that, but I can't talk about how the egg foo young isn't done yet.  Right, so this Words Hurt, it was the pamphlet, we read every word on the air.  Really, yeah.  And made a huge joke out of it, and then we get in trouble for making a joke out of it. 
[00:44:00]  We're like, you're going to drive us insane.  We can't take this stuff seriously in what we're doing on our radio show.  Words have become so empowered.  People have become very, very nervous.  Where are the four places you draw from, though?  Well, English language, social commentary, kind of.  I think that's the best word for some of that stuff, because it's not political, really.  More like social.  And silliness, you know.  And observations, you know, like about stuff. 
[00:44:30]  Universalities, things we all know.  And therefore, you have half the job is done with the audience, because they already know  the premise.  And all you have to do is kind of like then take care of business.  I think I started throwing stuff away after listening to your stuff bit.  Like, you know, we just collect stuff that just means it's nonsense.  Well, there's an interesting thing about something that someone gives you.  So, you know, it's very hard. 
[00:45:00]  Like, a year after your aunt gave you a bad-looking clock or a dumb thing for a lamp, a year later,  two years later, ten years later, it's really easy to be in storage and say, get that out.  That goes in the big pile over on the left.  That's going to Salvation Army or Goodwill or whatever.  But you know what's really hard to do?  Throw it away the same day she gave it to you.  And it's the same clock, and you feel the same way about it.  But your conscience won't let you take it and put it in the dumpster when she leaves the house. 
[00:45:30]  It's very interesting.  Enough time has to pass, and then you feel, okay, I can throw this away now.  You're so right.  That's really right.  Throw it out with the gift wrapping still on it.  That's right.  Yeah, say, why don't you meet me in the back?  Meet me back by the garbage cans when you get to the house.  It's because I got on it to make it easy for both of us.  I throw stuff away now, and people get outraged.  Like, you just got that for your birthday.  I'm like, yeah, they will never know that I just threw their stuff out.  I'm not.  Maybe that's where they're getting this stuff, going through the dumpsters. 
[00:46:00]  What is it about just the passage of time that makes certain things okay  when immediately it's just not?  I was brought up the Titanic being just a horrific thing.  A ship sinks, kills thousands.  Yeah, they sing.  And then, yeah, you fast forward a few years, relatively speaking, a blink of an eye,  and there's an inflatable ride at kids' parties that is shaped like the Titanic sinking into the lawn 
[00:46:30]  with a hose, and little kids slide down the deck.  And it's like, now it's a ride.  And they give you some smokestacks, too, so the kids can bounce off the smokestacks.  Yeah, they can bounce off the smokestacks, and you're like, this was a horrible tragedy  where people died in horrifically painful ways.  But enough time goes by, and it's a kiddie ride now.  And they wonder why it's all ending.  Yeah.  What's wrong with our country?  That's why after 9-11, I brought up that same thing. 
[00:47:00]  I go, how much time has to pass before they have a ride based on that horrific disaster?  And then people call up, hey, hey, hey, what do you say?  You're sick.  Well, the Titanic.  Come on, you don't think those people had family, friends, loved ones?  And now it's a kiddie ride.  Enough time goes by, people just seem to want to forget it.  And it's all different people.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all different people.  All different people.  And I've also found that it's okay to show dead people if they're far away or if it's 
[00:47:30]  old in black and white.  Yeah, yeah.  Like old World War II stuff, it's fine.  You could show Japanese people just burned to a crisp from a flamethrower.  Right.  Um, and you can show dead people now as long as they're a certain, uh, a few miles away.  Yeah.  You can't show them here.  Like they won't show American dead people in a car wreck or shooting.  I hate it when the newscast tells me, uh, you, you, you may, this coming, the footage  we're going to show may be too graphic for you. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  And I, you know, and I think not for me.  What else do you have in there?  You must have some more.  I start showing me the raw feed.  I start licking my chops.  All right.  I know you're lying.  Where's the raw feed?  I don't like, that's an edit.  And I, you know, something else I don't like when these local newscasts just say, there's  a woman in Los Angeles and she said after any accident or most accidents, the ones that  follow the description I'm going to say right now, she'll say, well, thank goodness 
[00:48:30]  no one was hurt.  And I don't agree with that.  I don't like, that's an editorial remark.  Save that for the editorial page.  Maybe it's, it's good.  Some people got hurt.  Maybe there are people who deserve to be hurt.  You know, maybe we should have more people hurt.  Well, how, who is she to decide this for me?  Yeah.  Tell me what happened, lady.  That's what I want to know.  That's why I tuned in here.  I'll say, thank goodness they weren't hurt or good for him.  Right.  I hope he's dead. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  They might be horrific people.  Yeah.  I like getting Carlin reports.  Like once in a while, you'll see like a comic that will go to see you as you're working  through the special.  It's always funny to hear like the things that cause certain people to walk out of the  room.  And occasionally over the years I've gotten them from people like, yeah, he was doing  this thing on abortion.  And some woman screamed, F you, George, and walked out.  It's funny to know, like even you as who you are, you're still getting this crap on the  road occasionally.  It's funny that people will buy a ticket who only saw you on the Johnny Carson show in  the 1980s or 60s or 70s or something. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  There are people who, that's why I really don't like Las Vegas audiences.  I go there for, for sound reasons for my own, um, travel, unless my markets kind of  breathe a little, you know, I go out.  80, 90 dates a year.  That's a lot of, uh, every two years I go out to a place.  And so I like to let them breathe.  And I go to Vegas to earn some money.  And, um, I've always told those audiences saying there's three kinds of people here  tonight.  I come out and I'd say this in the beginning. 
[00:50:00]  We have three kinds of people.  We have, we have hardcore fans, the kind of people, and some of them cheer when you do  that.  Hardcore fans, the kind of people that'll drive from Buffalo to Cleveland to see your show.  They're fine.  I said, then you have casual fans.  People who've seen you a few times and they saw you in college in the seventies and they've  heard a couple of your albums and they're okay with you, but they don't really know  what it is you do.  I said, and then there are the schmucks, there are the schmucks and the a-holes. 
[00:50:30]  I say, these are the people who, uh, one of them is from Thailand.  I'm sorry, Thai people.  One of them is from Thailand.  The other guy has on short pants and, and, and socks and is scratching his nuts.  And he has a coupon.  And these people, if these people are sitting near you, don't be influenced by their reactions,  please.  You know, I, I used to give them a great little, about five minute pep talk, but you couldn't  trust those audiences.  They go either way on you.  Aren't they dumb?  Isn't it, there's nothing more aggravating on stage.  Bombing is acceptable, but when you know you're bombing on content because they object to the 
[00:51:00]  content, like, oh, there's nothing worse.  That drives Jimmy nuts.  I, I would rather just get stared at.  I respect them staring, but I hate when they try to throw their, just, it's like an acting  job for the rest of the audience.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  And I don't know why they go out.  I don't know why they go out.  To aggravate you.  It should be open.  If you go into a theater of any kind, it should be open.  You should be there for wonderment and a new experience and surprises.  Yeah.  That's right.  Things like that.  Not, not, oh, oh, oh, I have to leave. 
[00:51:30]  I can't even be in the same room as it's like you're physically beating them.  They can't take the audio that is going into their ears.  It freaks them out too much.  What kind of frigging close-minded ass leaves a room because they're hearing something that  they, they, they don't really like.  Let's go to the phones.  A lot of people really want to talk to George.  Chrissy in Jersey.  What's up?  We got George Carlin in the studio.  Hi.  I just wanted to say that I love the F word that he does about the F word. 
[00:52:00]  Thank you.  I am obsessed with it.  It's the, probably the funniest thing that I've ever seen in my life.  And I, every time, like I have a couple of friends over, I show the skit to them and  it's probably by far the funniest thing that I've ever seen in my life.  I love it.  You sound like a nice group.  Thank you very, very much, Chrissy.  What's that about there, George?  Just for the people.  I think she's talking about the F.  Oh, please.  Oh, sorry, Chrissy.  The F word, she said.  Yeah.  You just do a whole thing on it? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Different variations in usage.  You attack the baby boomers.  I don't think anything makes me happier than when you really slug the baby boomers.  It's just such an accurate, awful, and have them in the audience.  They're such pigs.  And it's not just a demographic thing.  It's a certain type of boomer.  I mean, some guy in rural Minnesota who's of that age group obviously doesn't fit the  description, but the stereotypical baby boomer who was all in favor of free love and peace 
[00:53:00]  and screw authority who became a banker and now is kicking people out of homes and shit.  You know what I like?  I like that commercial, the retirement commercial now with, oh, who the hell is in it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The guy was in Easy Rider.  Yeah.  Oh, Fonda.  Dennis Hopper?  No, Dennis Hopper.  Oh, Hopper.  Thank you.  Dennis Hopper is trying to be like, cool, man, but he's talking about your retirement  plan, man, and how you got to go.  Their key word is dreams.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:53:30]  They think if they say that, that gets them in the door all the way down.  Right, right.  Your dreams didn't die, man.  Your dreams don't retire?  Yeah, your dreams don't retire, man.  Come on, man.  And you're like, wait a minute.  This is the guy who was smoking pot and a wild man.  You should have that then pan to an old lady being beaten by a black orderly.  By the way, during the break, you were talking to George about just going about your life  and seeing stuff and going, wow, this is why the rest of the world hates us. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm one that, like, I just kind of skip through life with my shoelaces untied.  I know.  I kind of have a good time.  I like having fun.  You enjoy sucking up all our energy.  I drive a big, disgusting gas guzzler.  I have a sports car that even uses more gas.  I don't care.  I really don't care.  I'm on a roller coaster ride, and I could give a crap if the sun exploded tomorrow.  I'd actually feel better about it because I'd get to watch. 
[00:54:30]  You know, that's how I feel.  That's how I feel about the whole thing.  But I do understand watching television shows and seeing things that happen around.  At least I know what I'm doing.  I see why we're hated by the rest of the world.  It's some of this reality programming, things like you bring up anorexia, the news.  You just watch certain things and go, you know, we have no clue how, like, France and Spain,  other countries are looking at us and just going, oh. 
[00:55:00]  Malignant narcissism.  Americans.  What's that?  Malignant narcissism.  And that's what we were guilty of.  We're narcissists.  We see our own reflection, and we were entranced by it.  Well, we were the big, you know, we were the big kahuna on the block for quite a while.  And we were pretty much the world's saviors, keeping everyone safe from the dreaded commies for so long.  You can get into the details of a lot of that. 
[00:55:30]  Well, I'm talking about perception here.  You know, as far as especially Americans go, we were raised thinking, oh, my God, these awful communists here, they're taking over the world, and we're the good guys.  So when that whole thing came down, we ended up with no one to really have as an enemy.  Right.  And I think we really started turning on ourselves.  Yeah.  Then we found the Muslim religion to turn on.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  They're going to win, by the way.  I say that in some of my shows.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Muslims are going to win because they're going to out reproduce us.  They're already doing that.  They will definitely have more babies than we do.  And they don't care.  You see, they have nothing to lose.  I learned very early growing up in West Harlem, you don't necessarily, if you have to, you have to, but if you don't necessarily get into a fight with some guy who doesn't give an F, a guy, a person who has nothing to lose will always beat someone who has things at home that he wants to protect. 
[00:56:30]  Always, always, always, always.  They don't care.  They don't care.  And there's more of them, and they're going to be more and more and more.  Or Europe is already becoming Muslimized.  That stuff is over.  White race is on its way out.  We don't even reproduce a replacement rate.  No, we kind of fairly replace ourselves.  Because we actually think about it sometimes.  They go, can I afford this?  Is this, well, my career is a little more important than this. 
[00:57:00]  How many kids can I afford?  College costs are so high.  I guess we could do two.  I really wanted five or seven.  I agree with you.  Because it's a long game.  We look at it as like this generation.  Yeah, right.  They're in for the long haul, man.  That's right.  They're in for the long haul.  Time is on their side.  And we're so anxious to look at the next quarterly dividend.  The next quarterly dividend.  They could wait a thousand years.  It's coming, folks.  And some of you are going to be alive to feel the blade. 
[00:57:30]  To feel the blade.  It's going to be wonderful.  They certainly could wait a few hundred years.  Yeah.  Because, especially in America, everything is ADD.  Everything is instant gratification.  Oh, yeah.  They don't think on that level.  They're like, we'll take our time here.  What do we got?  Got some sand?  You got a little fire going?  Okay, man.  We're cool.  We're good for another hundred years.  Yeah.  We'll wait this one out as they're concerned about getting their latest phone that cooks  pancakes, like you said.  That's right.  Yeah, and rubs your nuts.  Man, I thought the exact same thing.  I'm like, these guys are going to win because they're not about this generation, about getting 
[00:58:00]  it done right now.  Right.  This is a long-term thing.  Doomed.  We're just doomed.  Do you ever regret going after anything or no?  No.  Like, is there anything you went after that you're like, ah, I shouldn't have?  No.  I've never, I don't remember ever feeling like that.  No, no.  Sometimes I wish I had done some things extra.  You know, some, some, I wish I had thought even harder about something.  Because I hear people like that so much, why didn't I put more work into that?  You know, that kind of feeling.  But nothing on the other direction, no. 
[00:58:30]  Good.  And, well, you're acting.  Kevin Smith has put you in a few movies.  Yeah, yeah.  Very entertaining.  It's fun.  Kevin's a good dude, and it's a lot of fun.  But it's a waste of time, because you sit around all day for someone else to tell you  what to do about something another guy wrote.  Right.  A different guy wrote it.  One guy wrote it.  One guy directed it.  And all you do is you just show up and repeat.  And I'd rather be sitting there writing stuff and going out and saying, hey, listen to this.  You know, what do you hear this? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't seem like the kind of guy that wants to just sit around in a trailer.  If I had started at 19 and had real tough, good acting coaches in New York, good teachers,  good course, you know, really learned technique and all that, acting would have been a great  life.  But that didn't happen.  And you can't just say, oh, I'll do that, too.  In my case, you can't.  Yeah.  Some guys do it.  Some guys pull it off very well.  George Carlin's show lasted, I think, one season.  Yeah.  Was that, was that, I'm sure it had some, was the writing difficult because of what they  were telling you above?  Was it hard to go where you had to go?  I knew it probably wouldn't have much of a chance, but I was, I think I was 55 then. 
[00:59:30]  And I said to myself, you know, I've had a lot of offers from different directions about  sitcoms over the years.  And maybe I ought to at least give this one shot so I don't say someday, gee, I should  have tried that.  I mean, I hadn't really turned into as good a writer as, that was 15 years ago.  And I'm a better, I didn't know I was a good writer then.  I mean, I've had three books since that thing failed.  I'm so glad that show went away.  When that guy called me from Fox, I said, thank you. 
[01:00:00]  Thank you so much for doing this because I was afraid this would drag on for another year  and then come to an end, you know?  I had a showrunner, creative partner, Sam Simon, who was a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant  comic talent, but famously disliked by his colleagues in the business.  And he admits that.  And it was very difficult for me.  And I don't, I think the cards were stacked against me.  I wasn't part of the club.  You got to be part of that club.  That's a Hollywood club. 
[01:00:30]  And you have to work your way into it in certain ways.  And coming in from the outside like that, it didn't work.  And they didn't back my show.  Fox didn't really back it.  So that's fine.  But I wanted to give it a shot.  I didn't want to walk away saying I'd never tried that.  Yeah.  Well, that music means that we are ending this side of the show.  Slightly.  Damn it.  We're going to definitely plug, Joe.  We're so happy you came in, man.  By the way, for the trick-or-treaters, we're health-free.  Sally and I are health-conscious. 
[01:01:00]  The kids come to the door, they get a B12 shot.  That's nice.  The Opie and Anthony Channel presents a very chippersyn Thanksgiving.  You guys know there's only 12 good comics at a time.  More legendary appearances from our favorite stand-up comics coming up.  Double guns, motherfucker.  More memorable ONA appearances from the biggest names in stand-up.  A very chippersyn Thanksgiving continues on the Opie and Anthony Channel. 
[01:01:30]  Hey, it's segment three here on a chippersyn Thanksgiving.  This is Ricky Jervison.  He's also joined by Louie, J Ma, and Ron Bennington.  Lewis and Ricky are going to talk about doing an HBO special with Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock.  And they talk about Ricky doing his show, Idiot Abroad.  I didn't understand that.  I don't like British humor. 
[01:02:00]  It's too weird up.  It's too snooty.  Oh, let's have some tea and crumpets or something.  I never liked that.  My mother used to watch Martin Lawrence.  She'd sit there with a giant kielbasa.  And she'd put her legs up on the ottoman.  Say, now get out of the room, chipper.  I'm going to watch You So Crazy by Martin Lawrence.  She's a wonderful woman.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, we're back.  And in studio, Ricky Gervais.  It's an all-star lineup. 
[01:02:30]  You've got Louis C.K., Ricky Gervais, Ronnie B., Jim Norton, and Jay Moore.  Oh, my God.  How are you, Ricky?  Very well, thank you.  And you walk in the room, and everyone just starts talking about how much weight you lost.  Yeah.  And that it could be because maybe something's going to come with you.  But not in a complementary way.  I was saying that he looks AIDS-y for a fat guy.  That's what he said.  I was being polite.  Lots of half slices.  Brilliant.  A lot of half slices.  Half slice.  Half slice.  Look at you, you big fat slob.  Yeah, I'm eating.  You've got no regard for the people listening.  This is what Ricky does when he starts shitting on me because he's deflecting negative attention 
[01:03:00]  from himself.  Attaboy, Lou.  He thinks I'm an easy target because I'm kind of heavy, and I eat in front of people.  I'm a little messy.  It's not going to bother you.  But Louie runs like 10 miles a day.  Do you still run?  Not these days, no.  I saw Louie in a locker room in Las Vegas, and he just got off a treadmill for 12 miles.  I used to run a lot.  And then he goes right into a Waffle House.  That's right.  And he said you run so you can eat that way.  That's right.  Oh, really?  Maintain a shitty health.  Fuck, that's a smart way to do it.  That would kill me if I didn't exercise. 
[01:03:30]  That's smart.  It would kill me.  That's smart.  Yeah.  I've never...  But you're pretty fit, though, aren't you?  You box and you run about.  You're just big.  You're boxing training.  But you're naturally big as well, aren't you?  I have a big body, yeah.  I always think of Louie.  You know the thing in the Fantastic Four?  It's like you peeled off all the lumpy bits, and that's what you're looking for, Louie CK.  That's what you're looking for, Louie CK.  More or less.  Ricky, how much did you lose?  Let's get it out of the way.  Jeez.  You know how much you lost.  You're trying to act like casual.  You're told I am now. 
[01:04:00]  I was...  I'll convert this for you Americans.  I was...  For you Americans.  I was 13 stone 13.  Stone.  Say no more.  Oh, I don't know.  Worthless country of fucking idiots.  And now I'm 12 stone 3.  He lost five quick.  So you lost less than a pound?  Stone.  He actually lost Sly and the family stone.  No, like he sits in a big scale, and they put rocks on the other side of the scale.  That's how fucking shitty your dumb country is.  Brilliant.  Yeah, you've nailed us.  Well done. 
[01:04:30]  Perfect.  Brilliant.  Aren't the English stupid?  For having empirical white system.  Well, you started with, oh, you Americans.  I have to convert this for you Americans.  Yeah, that's what pissed off Louis.  That got me going.  How was that an insult?  I'll be the ref.  That's what pissed off Louis.  I knew the differences between our white systems.  Nah, you insulted him a little bit yourself.  Yeah.  You got a little out of one yourself.  De Niro coming through.  Louis doesn't go for the anti-US shit.  He never has.  No.  Thank you.  All right. 
[01:05:00]  What are you having there?  Yeah.  Should we start?  What are you having?  We started.  Yeah, we're already taping.  What are they bringing?  What are you having?  I want to know what that is.  This is radio.  No one knows who brought me anything.  Well, I'm telling you, somebody brought drinks in here.  Someone brought you something.  Look at all these hot chicks in here.  Look at all these hot babes.  Wacky time.  For the big Ricky Gervais interview.  Now we need to know what you're drinking, because now we did bring it to the attention of everybody.  This isn't radio.  It's a cup of tea, and they brought me some milk to put in it.  Right? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, just let's have a conversation.  Let's have a conversation.  Yay!  Let's have a conversation about stuff.  Do you prefer skim milk now that you look better?  Yes!  Yeah, I do too.  Oh, this is good practice when I do the view.  Your show is good.  I saw the episode.  Thank you.  It was fucking great, man.  That's what I'm here for.  Normally, comics, me and Louis said, normally listening to comedians talk about comedy is  revolting, but it wasn't.  Honestly, it was fucking really insightful, and everybody was honest.  It was fucking great.  Let's get the name of this. 
[01:06:00]  I really enjoyed it.  It was really good fun.  I was really worried that there'd be lots of talking over each other, but it was good,  because we really came at it from four different points of view as well.  Louis was great.  He was brilliant.  No, because it was like he wasn't doing it like he was on television.  Do you know what I mean?  I think that's his life, though.  I think in most things, he does.  Look, I want to get the basics out.  It's called Talking Funny. 
[01:06:30]  Is it a one and done?  Because that's what we can't figure out.  Well, at the moment, we'll see how it goes down, but then we can do some more with better  comedians.  And it's you, Louis C.K., Chris Rock, and Jerry Seifeld.  That's right.  It picks up from mid-conversation.  It just starts like literally like the first half was chopped off, which is great, because  there's no lead up.  They're just talking.  Well, that's kind of what it was like, wasn't it?  Because we sat down, and they mic'd us, and we're all chatting already.  We started talking in the hallway, all four of us.  And so they start corralling us to our seats, and we don't even notice the difference. 
[01:07:00]  Now we're sitting in chairs, and somebody's mic'd us, and we just kept talking.  And I think at some point, we realized we've been on this show now for 40 minutes or something.  Because it was like five hours, wasn't it?  Well, I felt afterwards, I thought, oh, I didn't really, I wasn't really funny, and  I didn't talk about comedy.  Because I was thinking, this is a TV show.  We better have something to talk about.  But it just sort of flowed.  And we talked for about four and a half hours, didn't we?  And then cut it down.  So it's nice and tight.  What are you going to do with the other three and a half hours?  I think a lot of comedy fans would love to hear that. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, we've got that.  A lot of that, at one point, Louis just shut his pants.  So we had to clear it out.  I had to take that out.  It was really funny.  I do that every, that's how I, I just, that's part of my maintenance.  Ricky's done this before with Gary Shanling.  That was the most amazing, uncomfortable, hysterical.  He went to Gary Shanling's house.  Yeah.  And Gary Shanling looked cagey and felt invaded.  And it's the two of them talking and Gary just not letting Ricky have a conversation with him, really. 
[01:08:00]  I think.  And then he left.  I know.  It's fascinating.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Good to see that.  He was sort of in a different place then.  And he spoke to me afterwards.  And he said, oh, I tried something.  It didn't quite work.  So I think that.  What was he doing?  A character?  Well, I think.  Well, no, I think he thought we were filming for his DVD at one point because we were going  to do that as well.  So I think he was, he was sort of in a different sort of place for it.  But yeah, it's, it's interesting. 
[01:08:30]  I left, you know, I left in all the awkward bits.  I think you've got to.  Yeah.  But what is there to try during an interview?  Someone's interviewing you.  Like, I tried something.  What?  Fucking into the closet.  Well, he tried.  He kind of tried being unpleasant.  Just like he's acting like he didn't want to do it.  But it's fascinating.  It's like a great hysterical interview.  And you're just like, I'm so glad I'm not there.  I'm just glad I'm watching.  You know, it's great.  Well, I couldn't.  The thing is, what I couldn't do is I didn't want to sort of come back at him too much because  I'm this young pretender seeing my hero. 
[01:09:00]  And I thought it would have looked really bad.  So I don't know if I, did I, did it look like I was sort of caught in the headlights  a little bit?  Yeah, but it looked like you were enjoying it.  It looked like you were, you know, taking some shots from a guy that you're like, this  is still great that I'm here at his house.  That's the thing about it that's fun to watch.  Yeah.  Is that he's slinging these horrible comments at you.  They weren't that bad.  And you're kind of, you're kind of giggling.  Yeah, you were laughing.  There's nothing funnier than being insulted.  Right.  There is nothing.  If someone insults me.  Oh, you get excited, right? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, exactly.  We're not in that way, but yeah.  Do you, uh...  What way?  Oh.  Ricky, do you like being uncomfortable?  You get a boner when people insult you.  I love being uncomfortable.  I think Louis loves it.  He gets an erection when people insult him.  That's what we're trying to refer.  He gets a hard penis.  What is it?  What is it about being...  When people insult him.  I'm glad you quantified that, because his father used to say, you piece of shit, and then he  would get really hard, and he'd go jack off and come in his room.  Well, when he says I'm getting an erection, I'm still flaccid. 
[01:10:00]  That's my version of an erection.  He gets a softer.  Do you jerk off on your...  Yes, it goes softer, in fact.  But then, yeah.  Do you jerk off on your back or your stomach?  Sometimes I lay on your stomach.  Oh, you mean laying on my back?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought you meant, like, a fountain.  No, no, no, no.  It goes up, then I catch it, like David Beckham doing ball tricks.  Hey, watch this, yeah.  The bicycle kick.  The bicycle kick with his own cunt.  That's right.  Oh, it's like radio. 
[01:10:30]  Why do you like being uncomfortable?  Well, I don't like being uncomfortable.  I don't really get uncomfortable.  I like when the situation's uncomfortable.  Maybe not me personally.  I think being embarrassed is almost admitting it.  If you come out of a...  You know, you're a party and you come out of the toilet  and you've got a piss stain  and everyone's sort of, like, you know, not saying anything  and you look down and you see it,  that's just embarrassing.  If you come out and go,  look, I pissed myself,  there's no embarrassment.  Do you know what I mean?  Why do you have a piss stain when you go to the bathroom?  Exactly.  It's on the back of the front.  I've told you, I've been doing cum tricks  and I popped it away too quickly. 
[01:11:00]  You just piss through your pants,  you just let it go through your...  Why do you even go to the bathroom?  I filter it through,  like when your nan used to strain,  sort of jam through...  My nan.  Stockings.  Oh, oh.  That's right, my nan,  I forgot about my nan.  Don't forget who invented English.  It's not about the words,  it's we don't have nans.  We had parents  and then we raised ourselves.  We didn't have fucking nan.  What the fuck is it, nan?  I don't mean nanny,  I mean gran.  I mean grandmother.  That's our word for gran.  I don't know what that is.  All right, then say parents. 
[01:11:30]  I don't know what that is.  Brilliant.  I don't know what that is.  Me nan.  Jesus Christ.  And over here,  we all call our grandparents  different things  than even our neighbors.  Like, we don't have  a catchphrase for that.  Right.  People go,  mum, mum, papa,  pay, pay.  This makes shit up for grandparents.  Your grandfather's just the guy  who molests you.  Oh, that's sad.  You didn't mean to ruin the movie.  Not only that.  It was sad.  It was sad.  It was true.  You got a little out of line yourself.  Do you feel bad when you liked it, though?  No, not at all.  I kind of egged it on.  That's why there's shame. 
[01:12:00]  Those diapers fell off by themselves.  That's why there's shame.  Because it feels good.  Sure there is.  Oh, boy.  You guys invented incest, too,  over there, didn't you?  It is very popular.  It is very, very popular.  Actually.  Only in sort of like  more the countryside, I suppose.  Peter Philly is definitely  more popular in England than America.  I thought you said a guy's name, 
[01:12:30]  Peter Philly.  Pete from Philly.  Pete Philly.  You're on the air.  Peter Philly is very popular.  Don't you ever edit  what comes out of your mind?  You ever thought?  Why do that?  Don't bother saying that.  Why do that?  That's not ready.  That's not ready for an anecdote yet.  Let's keep that in there.  Why do that?  I don't fucking shit with happy.  No, I don't.  That's right.  That's why your new CD  is called No Filter.  I want to feel bad about that, 
[01:13:00]  but I don't.  I just can't.  Do people sort of listen,  going to work in their cars this show?  Do you get any feedback about this show?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do they do?  They've been on the air for like 20 years.  They never got any feedback.  I don't think it's going out.  No.  I really don't think.  It's like some big practical joke.  If you need to know,  we won't be looking at feedback today.  I want to do that with Celebrity Big Brother or something.  They go in there,  then after six weeks, 
[01:13:30]  you say we weren't filming any of it.  Yeah, you just wasted six weeks of your PR.  How great would that be?  That would be so great.  And the people still don't know who you are.  That would be so great.  Would the real show be filming them after?  Yeah, exactly.  Yes, the real show would be watching their reaction.  All right, no filter.  I'm talking to a heavy hitter here.  Relax.  You're talking to who?  A heavy hitter here.  You should film them, though.  You have to film them anyway.  You can't just not film them.  You have to film them,  tell them you did,  and then film the rest after.  Jim Rickey.  No, but you didn't get them.  No, I know,  but you weren't painting the whole picture. 
[01:14:00]  You were fucking telling them a shit show.  I'm trying to fucking help you.  You were going to pitch a bad show.  He's working on it.  What the fuck is bad about it?  Just film them after?  What if some shit happened during,  you got to film them during  and just lie to them?  Ruth, like, we really didn't film you?  Then you're wasting the cruise time.  You're being greedy.  I think the thing you have to do  is really put people in a room  for like three months  and tell them that they're on a show  that's going to be huge  and don't film it.  Exactly.  And don't film their reaction.  Just for yourself,  enjoy shitting on those people. 
[01:14:30]  Can't you film and show them their face  when you told them it was being filmed?  No, don't film that either.  Don't film it at all.  No one will ever know about it.  In fact, don't let it go.  Just an enormous skitter box.  Don't even just let it go out  by word of mouth.  Send messengers out.  If somebody could figure out  a way to advertise on word of mouth,  that would be really something.  You're not allowed to tell this story  unless you say buy a Buick  or something like that.  Yeah, I wanted to do that  with starving Africans.  I wanted to hit the button.  Give them T-shirts  with like Office DVD 
[01:15:00]  still available or something.  So then when you saw them  on the news thing,  they were sort of like,  they were getting free clothes and stuff.  Right.  And then you say,  please feed this kid.  Yeah.  And people are like,  oh, fuck, the office is still out there.  Yeah.  You still get that.  That's what you would advertise  is that your show from 20 years ago  is still on DVD.  That's what you would advertise.  Okay, talking funny.  There we go.  Yeah.  We started talking about that,  didn't we?  What?  Well, I don't know what else we have.  It was very kind.  There was different philosophies.  The interesting part is to hear,  you know, 
[01:15:30]  Jerry's philosophy is a lot different  about keeping the act  than Louis,  who flips his act every year.  And it was just interesting  to hear them kind of fucking banter  that back and forth.  Yeah.  I couldn't get over that.  Jerry is like the Rolling Stones.  You know, he just...  He's the hits.  Yeah.  He goes to sort of Vegas  and he tours around  and he never commits anything to DVD.  Doesn't it get boring?  No, well, I think he's sort of...  No, he loves the bits.  It's an evolution, isn't it?  Yeah.  He loves the bits to the point.  People come to see him  and the act.  That's right.  He does that thing.  But do you think the Rolling Stones 
[01:16:00]  like just playing the hits?  Or do you think they would really  want to get up there  and fool around?  Well, somebody told me they...  I know who knows...  None of this is true.  But whatever.  I was told by somebody  as I'm going down the road  of the credibility of the story.  You realize this fucking...  It's very thin.  I need to hear it anyway.  But somebody told me that  Keith Richards has a bunch...  A guitar for every song.  And the guitars are pre-tuned  instead of having the regular  six-string tuning.  They're tuned so he can just 
[01:16:30]  put one finger across the board  and just play the chords.  Five strings.  He takes the six strings off.  He takes the six strings  and he just plays  so he can just be barely awake  and just be running through the...  I don't know if that's fun.  Would you go crazy  if you weren't changing up your act?  Louie, hold on.  Yeah, I think I would have quit  if I didn't start doing that.  I think the person that told you  that was Keith in his book.  Oh, did he say that in his book?  It's kind of a huge chapter about...  So it is true.  I take the six string off  all my guitars.  That's why you can't pick up  a guitar in a guitar shop  and just play Start Me Up.  It sounds weird 
[01:17:00]  because there's six strings.  He uses the six string  to tie off with.  He's starting like that  as a kid  and then he's always right.  Are you criticizing Louie  for telling that story?  Like he's like,  all right, keep this under your hat.  I got the inside skinny  on the stone.  I knew a guy.  Check this out.  We're scalping Mets tickets.  We're in Queens.  Guy comes up to me  and tells me Keith Richard's story.  Now, I can't vouch for the guy.  You managed a band called Suede?  Well, yeah, sort of.  Oh, my God.  Sort of how? 
[01:17:30]  Well, I had him out  and then that comes out  once you're, you know,  now...  You could say famous.  You can say it, Rick.  It hurts, doesn't it?  It still makes me feel slightly weird.  It's a famous fucking guy.  Oh, you're a celebrity.  Yeah.  You're a shiny, shiny star.  Yeah.  Stars don't fall from the sky, do they?  No, they don't.  So are you now.  You're a sparkly star.  Yeah.  You won the comedy award, didn't you?  You beat me.  Yeah, I did beat you.  Best stand-up.  You and Whitney Cummings.  Yeah, no.  Deserved. 
[01:18:00]  You deserved it.  There was only three people  nominated for comedian.  Who was the fourth?  I just remember Ricky  because I like him.  I remember Whitney for the other thing.  What?  Who was the fourth?  Slappy White was in there.  You were doing great.  I remember the other one.  Stephen Hawking.  Father Guido Sarducci.  He should have won.  He says things funny.  He says I'm a funny.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, that was a dumb thing, the awards.  It was stupid.  It's nice.  It was.  It's the first time they did them 
[01:18:30]  and nobody cared.  24 hours later,  you take a shit all over their nice program.  They just gave you a fucking award.  Show some gratitude.  Did you even turn out?  What if I give you an award?  Then you have to say nice things about me.  I say nice things about you everywhere I go.  You're a fucking great guy.  Here's the water award.  That's for you.  You never say anything bad about me.  I gave you the water award.  Louie's incredible.  It's beautiful.  But what award is worth something, though?  It's only a matter of how long it's been going,  how credible it just turns up.  That's right. 
[01:19:00]  It's still the opinion.  Was it?  They told everybody three weeks ahead of time that they won  and then you showed up and it was like three weeks ago  and then it was on the news that people won.  I was canvassing right up to the day.  It's still weird.  I was wasting it.  I wasted a million pounds phoning everyone I ever knew.  What did they hand you, Louie?  What did the award look like?  Did you turn up?  Yeah, I went because it's an industry for my house.  Thank you.  I'm Louie C.K.  I may look cynical on the outside.  That's right.  I said my name, too. 
[01:19:30]  I want to be friends with you.  I know Ricky Gervais.  He's famous.  I want to be famous.  I know Chris Rock as well.  I've got a watch by Chris Rock.  He came here.  Oh, my God.  You fucking.  Oh, my God.  That's brutal.  He really is saying that you say one thing,  but you're really a speech-making cunt at the award show.  No, it's true.  It's true.  Mostly I want to thank the other nominees.  Whitney and Ricky.  They're just incredible.  And whoever the fucking fourth guy is that we don't know.  I like the word that I identify myself during that speech, though. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, I'm Louie C.K.  Like, I would say my own name.  He's an immigrant cleaning houses.  Oh, hello.  I'm C.K.  Thank you.  Oh, I love Louie.  Oh.  I shared a plane ride with him once, right?  It's on YouTube.  And look it up.  It's Ricky and Louie goes to New York.  That's right.  And it was when we were filming The Invention of Lion.  Shut the fuck up.  Right?  And we were living in Lowell, weren't we? 
[01:20:30]  Lowell, Massachusetts.  Yeah.  Thoughts?  It was all right, wasn't it?  About Lowell?  Yeah.  I met Mickey Ward there.  I know.  It was a big relationship for me.  Absolutely, yeah.  No, sir.  He traveled with me and trained me for the special I did the next year.  He went on the road with me and trained me as a boxer for my special.  Mickey's an amazing guy.  But I met him.  He was driving trucks for the show, for the movie.  Yes, it is, I think.  Yeah, he's a working guy.  Yeah.  And then we were on a private jet.  Yeah, that's right.  Ricky had a private jet that the company gave him and it flew to New York. 
[01:21:00]  And we were here.  Hold on.  Those are two words that don't go together.  Private jet, lol.  Yeah, no, not very much.  We were the only private jet to ever land in Lowell.  They were all a plane tree.  They were all looking up until they fell over like penguins.  And we were here in New York and I was getting a ride back with him and he was getting pissy  because I was late and I was late because my dog got hit by a truck.  No, you weren't.  No, on the way there, he's late. 
[01:21:30]  I'm waiting for him.  It turns up he's forgotten his phone.  We have to go back for his phone.  It turns out he hadn't forgotten his phone.  He'd forgotten another phone.  He had the phone on, but then he's forgotten his key.  So now we have to wait for him to go.  That was on the way here.  Absolutely, a shambles.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  Sounds like a comedy of ours.  Honestly.  But he doesn't care.  He doesn't say sorry.  He just goes, oh, I don't know.  I said sorry.  What do you mean I didn't say sorry?  I lost my money.  I lost my money.  Right?  That's how I talk?  Yeah.  And honestly, you have never seen anyone so scared as him on this plane. 
[01:22:00]  It is amazing.  I'm scared too, but because he's more scared than me, I'm laughing, thinking we're going  to die.  And it was sweating.  It was bad turbulence.  It was, he was trying to get drunk really quickly.  Yeah.  Just sweating.  And he filmed it.  It was amazing.  Did you get sick?  All that bouncing around makes me nauseous.  I take Dramamine when I fly.  The things he was shouting.  He was shouting.  The most disgusting things in history, yeah.  Fuck your mother.  Put a frog on your cock and fuck your mother.  Hitler fucked his wife.  Ten-year-old gay kids.  Fuck me. 
[01:22:30]  Being racist.  How does that help you, though?  How does that help?  It takes me out of my fear.  Just being racist.  That's his happy place.  Brandon.  I didn't say anything racist.  You did.  I said babies with AIDS.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's much better.  That's racist.  That's racist.  Because you know they're black.  You know what kind of guy.  See, there he goes.  Oh, my God.  Of course it was.  All right.  That's unbelievable.  Hey, talking funny on HBO.  This will do us no good at all.  You never know. 
[01:23:00]  Someone's listening to that.  An idiot abroad.  I just want to say that.  I love the fucking show.  We're trying to figure out Carl.  You've known him for a long time.  Some people say he's an improv guy.  No.  He is brilliant at whatever he does.  He's either brilliant at being stupid.  You've seen the show, obviously.  Yeah.  I love it.  It's great.  I love it.  He goes.  His mind works really fast.  Well, he thinks like a comic.  That's what I'm saying.  He looks so completely like a comic because he looks at the situation, and it goes in, and  he says exactly what he's thinking, and they're like honed one-liners. 
[01:23:30]  People think he's scripted.  People think that.  But there's something about it because you keep thinking when you watch the show that  you're going to reach a point where he's going to become self-aware.  Yes.  Like the computer in Terminator or whatever.  And it's going to kill the comedy.  But he doesn't.  He stays that one way.  But he's not stupid.  Does he understand he's a comic, though?  Does he understand he's funny?  Oh, no, he doesn't.  That's the weirdest thing about it.  Well, sometimes.  Not when he's angry.  I think that rustling is just Louis just eating stuff out of a big bag like a fucking horse.  I'm sorry for my father in you.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:24:00]  I mean, just no concession to the public at all.  Never read me.  People have taken time to listen.  He's working.  I'm doing very well in my career.  Yeah, I wanted a word.  Yeah, I did.  I did.  Louis C.K.  I am Louis C.K.  And I did win an award.  Right.  And I crinkle the paper.  He just comes in because it's free shit.  I'm going to go on the right idea of that award.  Because you won the water award.  And I don't even know who else was nominated.  Congratulations on the water award, by the way.  Thank you, Opie.  It was a fucking bullshit show.  And they gave me a bullshit award.  It fucking sucked for us. 
[01:24:30]  But what the fucking prick?  Who the fuck is going to invite you back?  I don't care.  They're pretty worried, you fucking asses.  I don't care.  Hey, Brando snubbed the Oscars.  This is a Darwinist business.  This is a Darwinist business.  If this shit catches up to me, I will be gone.  Right.  As long as it's working, I don't care.  You're going to go with it.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  I don't care.  I want to go back to Carl for a second.  So when he says something funny and you laugh your balls off.  He's a normal guy.  But you see it in his eyes.  Like, he realizes he just made Ricky Gervais fucking laugh.  Well, yeah.  He knows that. 
[01:25:00]  I don't think he finds the things he's saying as funny as I do.  Because when he's saying them, it's usually from a point of anger.  You know?  Yeah.  It's like he's so wound up when he says something.  And you have to prod him and prod him.  And I'm doing it for my amusement.  Sure.  And a lot of people think it's bullying.  I don't see it that way at all.  It's not bullying.  It's not what mates do.  Even Carl says.  He says, well, if they say it's bullying, they're not doing anything about it.  You're giving him a good life.  Yeah, exactly.  He said, who's coming to my rescue?  No one's helping me. 
[01:25:30]  Now, Machu Picchu was the last episode.  Most people have seen it by now.  He really didn't want to go the distance?  It was a lot.  It's been a long time.  He climbs all the way up, if you know where Machu Picchu is.  And he sees it in the distance.  And he calls up Ricky, or it might have been Stephen.  He goes, I'm close enough.  I don't need to go any further.  I'm like, you're that close to an amazing place in the world.  That's a good example of what that guy's like, is that he doesn't have the same values as other people.  But it's almost like that part of scripted.  He doesn't need that the way anybody else would.  No, he doesn't need anything, though.  He doesn't need anything. 
[01:26:00]  He doesn't know what he wants.  He really didn't feel like going any further at that point.  He's looking forward to being old.  He said that.  He said, I'm looking forward to being old.  He said, the old people are no trouble.  I said, what do you mean?  He said, well, you just sit in a chair in the street, and no one looks at you like you're lazy.  That's an ambition for this man.  It's just great.  He's just happy doing his own little thing.  Second season?  But he's sorted it out.  I think he's got it right.  I think he's absolutely got it right.  He sees the world.  Yeah, he's a Buddha.  He's great.  A lot of people spend their whole life to get to that Zen moment of just being wherever 
[01:26:30]  you are, and he's born with it.  I love that he climbed to it.  You guys just shit on me for acting that way.  An hour ago.  No, we thought it was great.  You live totally in the moment, Jay.  You're like a fucking dog.  We thought that was great.  Yeah, but you do that emotionally.  You do that in a negative, bad way.  Yeah.  Because...  Like a bad dog.  Yeah, bad dog.  Bad dog.  All right.  Bad dog.  Fair enough.  Like a dog sucking his own dick.  Like one of those dogs that make you uncomfortable.  I don't know.  A dog that growls at somebody who just fed them.  I've never, ever seen that in my life. 
[01:27:00]  A dog sucking his own dick.  I've never seen...  I've never seen that.  Get the YouTube up.  Get the YouTube up.  Let's get the YouTube up.  You're right.  Even though they can, they don't.  They lick their balls, but they can.  Like, go down...  This is the dog sucking his own dick right there, Jay Moore.  It's good work.  It's all sucking his own dick.  Is it on YouTube really a dog sucking his own dick?  They suck their own dick.  With the gorillas walking up.  It's there, Louie.  What were you going to say about Carl?  You said you loved the fact that he...  That he would go to Machu Picchu and look at it and go, fuck, I don't need to... 
[01:27:30]  From a distance.  Yeah, I don't need to...  But he wasn't impressed by anything because he's uninfluenced by peer pressure.  He's a man who was never, ever bowed to any peer pressure, ever.  He's sorted out what he wants, and nothing will change that.  Were you surprised how well the show did?  Yeah.  It ticked ass.  Science channel, right?  I think people connected with him.  I think, you know, I think they...  Everyone sort of knows someone like that.  They're just never on the telly.  Right.  And I think that was refreshing about it.  He's not a...  He's not an actor.  He's not a presenter.  You knew what he was saying was the first thing that came into his head. 
[01:28:00]  Sure.  And that's gold dust, because you just don't get that.  Of course.  Are you going to do a second season?  Yeah, he's doing one now.  He probably didn't want to.  He didn't...  No, but...  Well, we lied to him.  Really?  He'd never hear this.  He'd never hear this.  Does he care that he's famous now?  No, he hates it.  What kind of lie did you tell him?  Well, he picked his...  Well, the first ones happened, for example.  Again, there's a thing on YouTube where he leaves a message on my phone. 
[01:28:30]  And he picked...  It's things to do before you die.  And one of the things he picked was see a whale.  So we sent him to Alaska.  We got him a boat.  But he didn't know it was a working fishing boat.  So once he was out there, he was fucked.  And they wouldn't turn around.  And it's like minus 20.  And he leaves this message at 6 in the morning going,  You fucking cunt won't turn around.  I'm not fucking doing the rest.  You fuck...  He's going mental.  Wow.  I put it on you, Jim.  He's got another 6 to do.  I can't.  Sign the contract.  All he had to do was...  Once he signed the contract, then he can't give the money back. 
[01:29:00]  Right.  So he's got to do it now.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  It is just like the best practical joke ever.  Wow.  Ever, yeah.  And he's picking things to do before you die.  And that's it, really.  Which he didn't understand.  He...  I remember explaining things to do before you die.  And he said,  Well, why would I want to do that if I'm dying?  I went, no, it doesn't mean you're dying.  They don't get a sick kid when he's got a week to live  and throw him in with some dolphins.  It doesn't mean that.  I'm going to get me back to the life support machine.  He thought that was it.  That's the thing.  Just before you die, you get chucked in with some dolphins or something. 
[01:29:30]  But he's...  Yeah, he's quite incredible.  But, I mean, I think he's...  I sort of think he's a genius as well.  Genuinely.  He's a...  A savant.  Yeah.  I wonder if anybody ever has a dying...  He deconstructs.  He looks at someone and he deconstructs it and he brings it down to its...  It's rawest nub.  And you can't argue with it.  He just...  Is it a form of autism?  I gotta ask.  No, he's not.  He's normally smart.  He makes stuff.  He's good with his hands.  Yeah.  He's, you know...  So is Carl in Sling Blade. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  But you see, there's a thing.  You just described an autistic kid.  He's good with his hands.  But it's also the way, like, people used to be before they were cluttered with a bunch  of extra shit to think of.  Yeah.  And he's not thinking about that.  He's thinking, like, really precise, like a person alive, you know?  But he says things like, knowledge is hassle.  He says you don't need all this stuff.  You know, he's got...  Well, you really don't.  No, I know.  I mean, you don't want to live a life.  But I think he's smart.  You don't need to know all this shit.  I think he's got emotional intelligence.  He's beyond most people.  I think he's sort of... 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, he's highly intelligent.  Yeah, I really think he is.  And he is funny.  I mean, he's hilarious.  And he laughs sometimes.  People have never seen him laugh.  Because, as I say, usually when we film it, we do a podcast, I've wound him up so much  that he's just so angry.  It's like...  I suppose he's like Rain Man, but without any of the clever shit.  And Tom Cruise just winding him up all the time.  All right, he's autistic, Ronnie.  He's not.  He's autistic.  Do you think I'm a bit like Tom Cruise?  What?  Of the two...  Of the two, of Rain Man and Tom Cruise, I'm more like Tom Cruise, aren't I? 
[01:31:00]  Why would you say that?  Why would that...  Based on what?  Just...  And I like that the other guy is Rain Man.  You're like Tom Cruise based on the rumors about your sexuality.  That's right.  That's right.  You're like Tom Cruise.  Get it?  This is surely libelous now.  This is surely libelous now. 
[01:31:30]  Do you care?  No, man.  We're just going with it.  Yeah.  What about the office there, Ricky?  Yeah, what about that?  You're getting your feet wet with the American office.  Yeah, well, I was just popping up for a laugh.  I remember years ago, you were like, you were staying away.  Now you've kind of taken a peek.  Well, we were staying away for a very good reason.  That we thought that it should be made by Americans for Americans.  You know, I worked in an office for seven years, and we made that.  And the attention to detail, I think, what made the office good.  And then, what's the point in doing a remake and doing it again?  It just didn't seem... 
[01:32:00]  Right.  I mean, originally, they wanted me to play the David Brent character.  And I thought, what's the point of that?  I just could have kept mine going.  But once it's on its own sort of two feet, I'm just doing it for fun, really.  It's a little...  What if they come to you and go, five million an episode?  That's what I got.  I got five million.  Dollars, though.  So, yeah.  But it was good.  You know, like, who was that bloke?  He's dead now.  Marlon Brando.  Didn't he get a million pounds for that cameo in, like, the early...  Superman.  Oh, money to Superman.  I forgot about that. 
[01:32:30]  He left out.  They handed him a bag of money and he left.  They actually gave him the money in the fucking scene.  Where he looked into it.  And they worked into the scene.  Said, all right, it's here.  Actually, Chuck Berry has done the same thing.  Oh, he waits.  Yeah.  You've got to have cash for him.  Yeah.  There's a bunch of million dollar guys.  There's a bunch of guys.  Chuck's not one of them.  He's a nine grand guy.  Not anymore.  But whatever you pay him, you've got to give it to him that second.  In the guitar case.  Yeah.  Next to the pistol.  He actually will unplug, put the guitar place in.  He's got a bunch of things.  Because he also wants a red Cadillac rented for him, waiting for him at the airport. 
[01:33:00]  That's one of those things that probably isn't true.  He wants a ham sandwich before he goes home.  His agent or whoever looks, has to be backstage with the money so he can see it while he's  on stage.  He does.  Yes, it is true.  And I actually saw him because he'll just use local guys.  He uses local guys to play with him too that he hasn't practiced with.  And then he walks out, plugs in while they're there.  They're playing.  They keep on playing.  And he looks at his watch.  It could be like, fuck it.  I'm done. 
[01:33:30]  But it's okay.  Yeah.  35 minutes and he's gone.  And they say, what are we playing?  He says, we're playing Chuck Berry songs.  Yeah.  And he just goes, it's the same song, I guess, 14 times.  Just keep doing it.  But everybody will end up there.  It'll be Louie one day.  It'll be just the same thing.  Louie's got a great attitude to money.  I think he says it in Talking Fire.  I don't know if we left it in.  We're talking about when Chris is saying, you're the blackest white guy ever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Countdown to poverty.  Yeah.  How black people, when they get Chris's old bit about how when white people are rich, 
[01:34:00]  they're rich and their kids are rich and their grandkids.  But when a black guy gets rich, it's countdown to when he's poor again.  But that's what it's like for me, yeah.  But you said you don't see it as your money.  You see it as the money.  Yeah, it's the money.  It's an element.  It's like oxygen.  That's great.  It's not right to hoard it around you.  You've got to keep circulating it back out into the system.  So you earn money and you spend it.  I spend it right out my asshole.  I just buy shit.  What'd you buy today? 
[01:34:30]  Nothing.  It's early.  It's only fucking 10.30 in the morning.  You buy gold, though.  That's smart.  Yeah, I bought some gold coins.  The gold thing's smart.  Yeah.  I love it.  I don't know.  You can pay Louis in three magic beans.  And he'd be happy.  I've got a bunch of gold coins.  They were about 900 bucks when I bought them.  They're an ounce each.  And they're now worth 1,500.  Oh, so this is true.  You really did buy some gold coins.  I've been to the gold store.  Where did you do that?  There are gold bullion coins.  What were you thinking?  I had cash.  I got paid in cash for it. 
[01:35:00]  So you went out and bought some gold coins?  I got some gold coins.  You did.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  And they went from 900 to 1,500 bucks each.  That's a pretty good profit.  It's just a weird purchase, though.  What else did you get?  A horse and a slave?  Yeah.  It's a throwback.  It is strange.  That is weird.  Did you do it as an investment?  Or did you think, I wonder if this will work?  What do you mean, if it'll work?  Did you do it as an investment thinking, I wonder if I can make money of this?  Or was it a little way more?  I just wanted some gold coins. 
[01:35:30]  It was shiny.  And I also knew that gold keeps going up.  It always goes up.  How do you know they're real, though?  Like, how do you know that's honestly 100% legit?  Is there American mint?  Is there U.S. Eagles or Canadian?  What do you think of this as an idea?  I want to do Idiot Abroad 3.  You bite it.  You bite the coin.  I want Carl to do this.  So Carl's going to do it, we think, right?  We're not sure yet.  But it's called Fool's Gold.  I give him a million pounds, and he's got to spend every pound once, and he's got to  make another million.  And he thinks it's easy.  He thinks it's easy.  He's got to give him a million pounds, and he's got to spend it all, and make two million. 
[01:36:00]  So make one million pounds.  So we invest.  He has to buy things that would figure some shit out.  And I said, what would you do?  He said, first thing, he said, buy some scratch cards.  He said 5,000.  That was his first thing.  5,000 scratch cards.  So $5,000 goes to scratch cards.  Yeah, and then he's just scratching it.  That's not terrible.  That's not terrible odds.  If he gets a few 20s in there, a few 40s. 
[01:36:30]  You know, scratch cards, you can make a few hundred bucks once in a while.  Yeah.  But here's the thing.  If you win, say $50, they'll say, do you want $50, or do you want me to give you 50 more  scratch cards?  Yeah.  That's a mistake everyone makes.  That's how they get you.  Yep.  I did that once.  When I was going, I forgot to buy my family presents, and I went down, and I got them  all like 10 scratch cards each.  You forgot to buy your family presents?  Yeah, yeah.  When I was late, I was going, yeah.  And the kids, there was like these nephews, like 10-year-olds, you know, winning a fiver  and then going down the shop and getting...  From like the smoked cigarette shop? 
[01:37:00]  Exactly.  They're addicted now.  The smoked cigarette shop.  Yeah, the smoked cigarette shop.  Whatever the fucking English fucking retards call it.  Whatever these fucking worthless fucking people call their version of it.  How many people did he offend in that?  English fucking retards.  Just in that one sentence.  Two, exactly.  Really, one.  They're all over there.  Oh.  Every retarded person is in England.  It's true.  Oh, God. 
[01:37:30]  Wow.  Jimmy.  Were you intimidated talking to, I mean, not on a personal level, because you know Louie  and you know Seinfeld, but you're talking comedy and stand-up.  But Chris Rock, because he's black, maybe you're intimidated by him.  I was trying not to say that, but it is what I meant.  And then he might steal something.  No, I was...  No, but three great comedians like that.  Yeah.  I mean, you're talking stand-up with three guys who are legitimately great.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was really.  All you're thinking then is, I don't want to be the least funny person in the room. 
[01:38:00]  I was.  But, you know, but then I get the back end.  No, but I loved hearing you talk about your fucking doing a new act every year.  Why do you curse so much?  Because it just makes me sound like people listen more when you curse.  I'm insecure about what I'm saying, so I say fuck, and people like this guy's got secret.  I liked it.  I liked it.  He's great.  I love this guy, honestly.  One of the most honest people.  I know.  I love his face.  Thank you.  I like the way he talks.  I like his fashion.  First time that's ever been said.  Yeah.  How can you not like that face?  He's great.  Jim is lovable.  Thank you very much.  Jimmy Norton. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, well, now the pressure's on me.  I'm just going to start fucking bombing fucking right, to be honest.  Never notice me.  If you don't notice me, I kill.  I remember Louie ruined your act once.  He made me laugh.  He said something to me when you were on stage, and you heard it.  No, that wasn't.  What happened?  Please don't tell me you're confusing me with that fucking buffoon Bob Kelly.  No, no.  Yeah, no.  You heard.  Really?  Yeah, because Bob was on stage.  He's confusing me with Bob Kelly. 
[01:39:00]  Bob was on stage.  I was on stage, and you were in the room, and I was in there with you.  The Comedy Center.  Yeah, and I said something to you, and you laughed, and Bob got excited, because he thought  you laughed at his end.  Yeah.  But you weren't even listening.  I was distracting you.  I thought that was you.  No.  Thank God you're wrong.  Were you on that night?  I was, but you were, I think, you weren't there when I went on, because I remember seeing  you outside.  Oh, maybe that's, yeah, maybe that's the confusion.  It was a great comic.  Thank you.  No, I know.  I've seen, I have seen you. 
[01:39:30]  No, I'm happy to be confused with Bob.  That's like somebody saying, like, hey, was that you in the yard?  Oh, sorry, that was dog shit.  I stepped in.  Your stage name is Carrot Top.  Yes, it is.  I have a lot of funny toys I pull out.  I used to hit a watermelon.  I was kind of him, too.  I was kind of him, too.  Did he die, or are you going to have a heart attack on stage?  He works at the smoking cigarettes shop.  And he has to sell his house now.  Oh, really?  Because he had a heart attack?  I don't know.  He's going to live in a van like the wrestler?  We learned that he day trades in between radio interviews, so I guess he wasn't good at that. 
[01:40:00]  He day trades?  Yeah.  Franchise had him on.  His brother, and his brother toured as Gallagher 2.  No, I remember that.  Yeah, we know.  But he's, so he's, but he's.  After the interview, he hangs out the entire day at the radio station and day trades.  It's very strange.  He just sits in the hallway.  I sat with him for an hour.  Buy gold coins.  Buy gold coins.  That's the way to go.  I've never been buying gold coins.  That's great.  I just can't imagine it.  Just imagine you going in and out with your breakfast all over you, and you've got a big  one of the cash.  And I go, good morning, sir. 
[01:40:30]  Hi, how much is that?  Yes, that's the way it works.  Buy a bunch of gold coins.  If the economy crashes, why would gold be worth anything?  Gold always runs up against depression.  But I guess at one point, like, oh, here's something shiny.  This is great.  But now human beings have, you know, television.  It's perfect.  Yeah, but gold keeps going up.  But it's perfect, isn't it?  Because it's finite.  So they know you cannot make it.  And that's it.  And you can't get it from anyone else.  The first time I ever bought gold coins when I was, like, I don't know, in the late 80s 
[01:41:00]  once.  This is so weird.  And they were $300 an ounce.  $300 an ounce was gold.  Now it's $1,500 an ounce.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, it's gone.  It just screams upward more than anything else.  Multiply.  That's really not that much.  But it's running the same as Coke.  It's running the same as Coke.  Yeah, but no other stock is like that, you know?  Sure it is.  Apple.  That's a good point.  Why does it go up?  Yeah, it's insane.  Because you could see, like, if you were a caveman, like, oh, it's shiny.  But now, if everything goes, if there's no water to drink, nobody's going to give a 
[01:41:30]  shit that you're holding gold.  That was the best radio face in history, by the way.  No one will get that.  If there's no water to drink, I'm not going to worry about my gold coins and how much they  get.  Fuck, my coins are worth shit.  I'm going to die with worthless gold coins.  There's no water.  That's going to be what I'm worried about.  My daughters are skeletons, and I'm worried about my gold coins.  It just seems like if you have gold coins, they're going to die with you, because you'll 
[01:42:00]  never...  You're not going to be a skeleton with some gold coins and a pirate hat next to you.  That's what I think.  Now, gold has, you know...  Do they move it around?  You know, when it's against, like, stocks or shares, or one country gives another country  $20 trillion billion, is that gold move somewhere?  I don't understand it.  I don't understand it.  Fort Knox has this massive gold reserve in it, but it might not exist.  No one goes and looks at it.  No one goes and makes sure it's in there.  Have you seen it?  I just wanted to be a part of it. 
[01:42:30]  Felt good to jump in and have the floor for a second.  That Bob Kelly is amazing.  Yeah, he's terrific.  I got tire tracks in my back.  Ronnie ran right over me for the flashlight.  Well, our money used to be on the gold standard.  That's what the pounds are, and you're pounds sterling.  They must see it, though.  It used to be when we have...  When we used to have American dollars, really old ones are called silver certificates.  But there must be a movement of gold, though, because otherwise, you could say to another  country, you know, we'll buy this and give them money that doesn't exist. 
[01:43:00]  There must be something to show for it.  There must be some sort of token.  How many stones did you lose?  How many stones?  It's not worth it, right?  Almost a stone.  It's about £22.  Atta boy.  But, you know.  Yeah, thanks.  You lost a lot more than £22.  You'll edit out everything that's happened between those two statements.  Right.  Six seconds.  I want you to lose a little bit of £22.  I go, thanks for talking funny as on.  Don't plug that.  No.  No.  That'll be cut.  No.  It's just stories about your friends. 
[01:43:30]  No, it's just not like radio.  It's just like hanging out.  Well, that's how we try to do our show, Rick.  It's the best way to do it.  Hearing Seinfeld, you said something interesting about how comedy is empathy.  I thought, well, he's right.  And then Seinfeld goes, no, it's not.  No, it's just jokes.  And then I was like, fuck, that's actually a good point by Seinfeld.  I don't know.  I think it is empathy.  I think you have to like someone.  I think you have to understand what they're saying.  I think everything has to be personified.  You can't make jokes about the inanimate.  But he was saying you are above the audience.  About the what?  About the inanimate.  The inanimate? 
[01:44:00]  Inanimate.  Something that has no...  I didn't hear the T at the end.  All right, sorry.  Maybe to laugh at somebody, you have to like them.  But Seinfeld is a weird...  He doesn't really fit into...  Every comic has something wrong with him that I know.  Like, they're sex addicts, they're drug addicts, they're gamblers.  And with him, I can't figure out what his fucking psychosis or problem is.  We'll find out after he dies, it'll all come out.  It certainly will.  His computer will be open.  I don't buy that, that you have to be...  You have to, you know, have visibly something wrong with you.  I think you have to be aware of your own inadequacies and plan on them.  But I don't think you have to wear it on your sleeve. 
[01:44:30]  Not necessarily, but every comic I know has something wrong with them.  They don't even necessarily...  Hold on, I'm having a pissing match here.  They don't have to wear it on their sleeve, but they actually all have something.  Seinfeld said you have to be above the audience?  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, he said...  That's what Bob said.  No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.  No, I said...  Catch a coffee!  No, I said...  Bob, you need some money.  No, I was saying that you can't be above the audience.  You have to sort of fall over for their pleasure.  In a way, you have to put yourself below the audience. 
[01:45:00]  Show them you've had a worse day than them.  It'll be funny.  He was saying, but you're already above them because you've got the mic.  They're all looking at you.  You're the only one talking.  I thought it was...  Well, Jerry also, he doesn't look at...  I mean, you have this really humane version of comedy, and it comes from sort of like Laurel  and Hardy and Chaplin and stuff.  Yeah, that's cool.  It's unbelievable, but he...  Jerry is a technician.  He's about the jokes.  Jerry looks at comedy like music.  Like, he used to tell me he was like playing a horn. 
[01:45:30]  It stops on paper, yeah.  He just likes to get...  He gets off on the material.  He gets off heavily on the material and how he does it, and he is...  You know, when I was young, I used to open for Jerry.  When I was like 18, 19, I got to open for him in one gig in Boston, and he liked me,  so he took me to a bunch.  And it was an enormous experience, because I kind of didn't think, when I was that age,  like, he wasn't my favorite guy.  I liked Stephen Wright, and I liked Carlin and Pryor, and I thought he was good, but I  didn't really know of him that much. 
[01:46:00]  But watching him do, you know, hour-long shows and theaters...  And this is before he had his show, when he was just a top-ranked heavyweight comic.  Like, watching him do that, the fucking guy is a virtuoso.  He is like a great, like, Vladimir Horowitz.  He's a fucking genius at putting on a comedy show.  He works so hard for his audience.  Yeah, he does, yeah.  But he's also, he's almost professorial about it as well.  He's got everything worked out, you know.  He's in control. 
[01:46:30]  He's very much into being in control.  And we identified that, too, on the show, that, like, he's...  Like, when he did my joke about the vacation going around the car, he did it in this very  controlled Seinfeldian way.  And it was like a one-liner, wasn't it?  It was at that rhythm.  That's my vacation.  What I was saying, that Louie's...  He's angry.  Yeah.  We're laughing at him because he can't get it out.  We're laughing at the human aspect of him.  I'm sweating and I'm sputtering.  I mean, they're there.  They're all there.  They're all sort of disguised and hidden.  But we're laughing at a man's breakdown. 
[01:47:00]  We're feeling it more viscerally.  We're not looking at the dots on paper.  And I think that a lot with comedians, when you see the comedians, and they can be great  one-liner with the puns, but you feel that you haven't learned about them.  You feel that you could read them out yourself and get just as good a laugh.  Well, there's almost no right answer.  That's what I...  There is, and why would there be?  When you look at Pryor and Carlin, I think they're the two greatest.  And they were completely different.  Pryor was extraordinarily personal.  Carlin told you nothing personal, but was still an observational genius and a social genius.  And Pryor was, too, but he did it through a person.  They both took different vehicles to get to the same place. 
[01:47:30]  Well, also, Carlin did bits, and he worked them out.  He had really well-phrased stuff.  And Pryor would just talk.  Pryor would just talk and talk, but he would hit beautiful moments that you know were precise  for him.  Carlin said he really turned the corner when he said, he used to say, I'm a comedian that  writes his own material.  And then he started saying, I'm a writer who performs his own material.  And he realized he was writing essays, and he was doing a one-man show in like four  pieces, like a bit about Earth, and he would just do a one-man show. 
[01:48:00]  That's right.  I tried to do that when I started off.  It's too hard.  Yeah.  It's too hard.  So now I just get bits, and I pretend to work them together.  You had the best quote in Esquire, and you said, Laurel and Hardy is like, the basic  root of comedy is Laurel and Hardy.  It's never been improved upon.  I'd be so much better off if I wasn't with this idiot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  You just can't improve that.  No, that's what it's about as well.  Ever since you said that, they just started showing it on these bizarre channels, and  I watch it, and I go, fucking Ricky Gervis. 
[01:48:30]  But it's even deeper than that, because it's like the blind leading the blind.  They both think they'd be better off without the other.  And one is more stupid than the other one, because he thinks he's cleverer than the  other one.  I have nothing to say to you.  It's just lovely.  It's just lovely.  It's just great.  And see, Louis, Louis' stand-up, I think, is good, because he's really sort of like  a threat, because he shambles out like an underdog, whose life's falling apart, but then  he's really clever.  And his targets are all correct. 
[01:49:00]  Even though they don't look like they are, they're all correct targets.  He goes after people.  Like retards fucking in England?  Well, you know, that's what you say about being above it, or I'm hung up on the empathetic.  Like, so are you, though, the jokes you make, they're clearly, actually, if they look cruel,  they're not.  They're not at all.  Yeah, no, I mean, I think people know that I'm being an asshole.  Of course.  I don't mind people thinking I'm an asshole.  Yeah, but they get it. 
[01:49:30]  They get it on a subliminal level, because they know you can't be.  But I don't know anyone that thinks you are.  What's that?  I don't know a single human being that thinks you're an asshole.  Oh, there are definitely people that think you are.  I don't know anyone.  I've never met anyone.  No, they know you're not.  When did you say it?  They go, oh, Louis is hilarious.  Or like, if I said it, you would not have a job.  I mean, it's like, when I do, there's things I do on my show where I take on certain subjects,  and the one way I've managed, when I'm doing something that's kind of controversial,  what I do is I make sure that I lose.  Yeah, because you're fighting an unreasonable world. 
[01:50:00]  You're always fighting an unreasonable world.  You're fighting with what, you know, the hand you would doubt.  And also, I like the fact you also start off, and I don't know if you do this consciously  or not, but people like you because you're bringing up two little girls.  So they know whatever you're doing, you're bringing up two little girls.  And I think that, and I think people have got to like you.  As an example, the Marx Brothers, right?  They're the biggest things involved. 
[01:50:30]  You don't have children, right?  No.  I don't know what that means.  I don't know what the hmm means.  The Marx Brothers, funny, everyone loved them doing stuff, right?  They transferred the films, and it's sort of exhausting, okay?  It's too long to be doing zany stuff.  So the eventual producer, director of the best films, they came and said, listen, I can  make you so much bigger.  And he said, we're putting a musical number, and we're putting a love story.  So now, it's these idiots, right?  But they're being idiotic and running around because they're trying to get two lovers together. 
[01:51:00]  So now everyone wants them to win because they're doing something worthwhile with their  stupidity.  You know what, though?  I hate those Marx Brothers movies.  I like the earlier ones, when they're just being fucking nuts.  I've got to agree with Louis, and it's because he won the award last night.  It's strange.  When they do that, and I think I'm in the minority, but...  It's an award-winning opinion.  That's right.  I was given an award for having this opinion.  No, I think it's the humanity again, because Groucho is always the underdog.  Even though he thinks he's cleverer than that guy, he's getting conned.  He looks...  No, no, that's what they were like.  But when they put in the couples and had them sing to each other, and the Marx Brothers became 
[01:51:30]  like a B story...  Those love stories were synthetic, horseshit, bad Hollywood love stories.  As opposed to the Marx Brothers act?  The great Marx Brothers movies, like Animal Crackers, that were just fucking crazy stories  that made no sense, but that were driven by this great comedy that they did.  But you need the decision, because it's exhausting.  Even, you know, like you're...  Okay, you can come out, and I can watch you for an hour telling me a story.  That's the human aspect. 
[01:52:00]  You can tell a story, and I can watch you for an hour, right?  If you come out and you do the best thousand one-liners, I'm looking at my watch after  20 minutes.  Yeah, no, when you purify comedy into just a fastball.  But, you know...  Yeah, I think that has to be...  There are guys...  I think it's just everybody's just different.  You can't...  You know...  There's some people who are empathetic and personal, and there's other people who just  got the fucking jokes.  After no further, his album's going to be...  Everybody's just different.  Everybody's just different. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  But with the same underneath, if you turn it over, and it's just him, leaning on his hands.  Leaning on his hands.  Put the same underneath, that'll be the album.  Everybody's just different, and I'm wearing like a leather jacket with the collar up.  Like Dennis Leary in the 80s.  And then on the other side, but the same underneath.  Folded hands.  I'll get you to tell some of the stories you told on Talking Funny, but that would ruin  it, wouldn't it?  I don't remember any of what I told you.  You told the best anecdotes.  They're all...  I don't remember.  You were great, man. 
[01:53:00]  You were really good.  It was a fun day.  When is your show going to be on television?  I saw Seinfeld.  It was a thrill to me.  With more respect.  That four hours went.  I saw Seinfeld looking over at you more and more, thinking, this guy's good.  Well, Jerry, you know, he used to kind of haze...  He used to tease me a lot, because we knew each other when I was fucking 18.  Why do you keep writing new material?  Why do you keep getting bigger when I'm sort of the same as I was before?  Have you ever noticed socks?  You gotta change.  I want my feet not to have shoes, but I need something between me and the floor. 
[01:53:30]  I have enormous awe and respect for Jerry and Chris and you.  I mean, when I saw The Office, when I first said...  I wouldn't have said it.  You think I felt like I had to?  I would have fucking loved if I didn't feel it inside.  Then you would have seen how those things hurt.  How fun that would have been to say, I had enormous respect for Jerry and Chris, and  then just watch your eyes kind of notice it.  I would have loved that.  I can't do it.  Or you could have just said Jerry, Chris, and Bob Kelly and humiliated me, too. 
[01:54:00]  How smart is Jerry, though, that he's the one that got Larry David in the middle of  all the comedy, boom and all, he was the one that, oh, I created a show with Larry David,  which was, Larry, you're right, and I'll do my acting.  And Larry couldn't get arrested back then.  Larry was just struggling.  But to be able to recognize that, to be able to get that.  But do you know, would you sound like you'd know that Larry did more of the heavy lifting?  No, I think that the stuff that he wrote, he wrote all the...  Seinfeld was all Larry. 
[01:54:30]  I've assumed it was...  Oh, you can tell.  Well, I mean, Jerry, Jerry, now that we know who Larry is, it came from Jerry's...  Who asked you?  Oh, sorry.  Why don't you shut your fucking mouth?  I'm sorry.  Yeah, what the fuck?  This is exactly like The View.  I'm going to say, when everyone's talking, everyone says, what the fuck are you talking?  Well, we say this show is kind of like the inmates run the asylum, you know?  That's a curve.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  It's like an upside down.  It is like an experiment.  It does feel like I'm part of an experiment.  Now, you're going to go out and you're going to fucking rape and shit. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, we should leave a sign on the door or something.  Rape is not an experiment.  It's a proven...  It's pretty well perfected at this point.  What's that?  Rape.  Oh, it certainly is.  Wait, I mean, you shouldn't do it, but it works perfectly.  Yeah.  You can do it.  Somebody's not minding their P's and Q's.  I think with that, we should get out of here.  Oh.  When is this program on television?  Always end on a rape guy.  Yeah, he's a guy.  Every time.  Rule one.  Rule one.  Bob Hope.  Oh, Bob Hope used to be the troops.  Bob Hope did the rape show.  Yeah.  I always lean with a rape show. 
[01:55:30]  But then he wouldn't win the Oscar.  Fine and the truth.  Great, great, great.  Yeah.  He made the girl back in Bangkok.  But he didn't win the Comedy Central Award, did he?  That's true.  That's true.  That's true.  Lois.  That's right.  Thank you.  Lois.  Thank you.  You beat out Ricky and Whitney Cummings.  You know, they don't let you keep the fucking award.  Who's the fucking fourth person you beat?  No.  They took the thing for you.  They never told us what that thing was.  That's so they can engrave it.  You came off...  They told me I won it a month before.  When did they fucking...  Well, on the award show, they couldn't just hand it that says, hi, here, Louie. 
[01:56:00]  No one's got...  Everybody got the same one.  No one's got...  I'm sure no one's getting it.  What does it look like?  You never told us.  It's a microphone on a black thing.  Yeah.  Stupid.  Yeah.  It's a fucking microphone.  Yeah.  Terrible.  And you're never getting that award.  It's a fucking terrible award.  It's because it was a bust.  Nobody cared about it.  It's just a prop.  So I swear they're going to go, why are we going to engrave them?  Nobody...  Do you know why I like winning awards?  Because I know there's loads of people out there that hate me even more for it and think  I shouldn't have won it.  And that gives me a bigger buzz than the people who go, well done.  I know there's someone somewhere in an apartment going, I fucking hate you in a fucking way. 
[01:56:30]  Here's the thing, too.  We don't know.  This could be big.  And he's like Wings of Desire.  He won the first year.  No one knows.  Those guys didn't show up.  They went, I don't give a shit.  Some stupid thing.  And now you were there for the first.  But I like to think that my special that didn't win is like Citizen Kane not winning.  That's true.  And people talk about that years from now.  Can you believe the bullshit?  Oh, with your little fucking flesh-colored microphone on your face. 
[01:57:00]  Your fucking headset microphone that's flesh-colored.  And now Colin has one color.  Like your fucking Sammy Hagar.  He's not real stand-up.  He doesn't hold it with one hand.  That's right.  That's right.  Take this shitty thing out of your voice and it's correct.  He's not really a stand-up.  He doesn't hold it with his hand.  I saw you in...  It was actually impressive.  I thought you were just talking really loud for a while.  Yeah.  Wow, this guy's good to read.  You're a great performer, man.  I watched you at the Paramount, I think.  Ricky's great.  I very rarely go to see stand-ups. 
[01:57:30]  But it was a very impressive show.  It was fucking great.  Thank you very much.  Let's end on that, surely.  Yeah.  That's the quote.  I mean, it's great patience on stage.  Ricky has...  Ricky, like, invests in little moments on stage.  That's all I can do.  I know.  That deserved more than it got.  With that, Ricky, thanks.  I have to ask so much.  Do you really like me, or is it really Bob Kelly we're thinking of?  No, I do like you.  Thank you.  But I got confused, because I wasn't watching him.  Oh, jeez.  It wasn't, obviously, because he was making me laugh about something, so I remember talking  to you that night.  It was a little hurt. 
[01:58:00]  I'm sure I've seen you as well.  No, I think you were great.  Probably on HBO or whatever.  I like your style.  It's like I've said.  I like the fact that it's visceral, and it's angry, and it's just not about that.  Do you remember one joke you did?  No.  That's the beauty of it.  Whenever you see a great show, you don't remember the jokes.  You just remember the feeling of being elevated that you experience, as opposed to my fucking  nonsensical joke.  You want to talk to him?  You talk to him.  You're not dying, Ricky.  You're killing everyone around you.  He had a big bag of props, and he got them out.  He did a different joke on every single one of them.  And none of it was planned. 
[01:58:30]  He was just cutting them out of the audience, wasn't he?  Yeah, it was like they just filled my prop bag, and I'm like, oh, what is this?  Yeah.  Improv.  We've got to get Ricky out of here.  Come back with Carl, will you?  Yeah, I will.  For the second season, can you bring Carl next time?  I think you should get Carl on and just ask him questions for an hour to show that he's  a real thing and get people to find him.  All right, we'll set that up.  We'll get Carl on.  Ricky Gervais, thanks.  Talk It Funny.  I think everyone's going to check it out on HBO.  Always a pleasure, sir.  We'll see you soon.  Bye, everybody.  Thank you. 
[01:59:00]  Nothing but the most memorable O&A appearances from the biggest names in comedy.  Just another sign of the absolute disintegration and decay of this country.  A Very Chipperson Thanksgiving will continue.  What's that?  On the Opie and Anthony Channel.  Nothing but legendary appearances from the biggest names in comedy.  A Very Chipperson Thanksgiving continues.  Here's your host, Lyle Chip Chipperson.  This is segment four, Stephen Merchant.  Stephan talks about restarting his stand-up career years after comedy writing. 
[01:59:30]  He's doing his first tour of The Us.  Jim and Stephan compare notes about starting out and how comedy progresses.  It sounds like a very mature discussion.  I don't really go for the British humor.  It's too snooty and up in the air.  Oh, let's have some tea or something.  And maybe some crumpets too, Chipper.  I like really good jokes. 
[02:00:00]  Like if someone's talking and you put your head in the room and go...  And make fucking fart sounds.  Why weren't you in...  Why were you in more and extras and not in the office?  Did you not want to be in the office?  No, it was just that there was no obvious role for me in that show.  And I was just pleased that I was writing it and being involved with it at all.  You know, it never occurred to me until much later.  Wait a minute.  Ricky was getting loads of free stuff for being on TV.  And that couldn't be me.  That's why I put myself in extras. 
[02:00:30]  I didn't want to miss a trick there.  But no, it was one of those things.  The weird thing is people always presume, if you're involved with TV,  that you want to be on TV and be a star and be the centre of attention.  I was enjoying being a writer and director and stuff.  And your town hall tomorrow and the next...  Right, two shows.  So much for behind the scenes.  Wow, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, no, because I started stand-up years ago.  That was the first thing I ever did was stand-up.  Oh, good, good.  Right, when I first left college.  And I went, you know, I did it for sort of five years to almost total indifference. 
[02:01:00]  And since I've had a degree of celebrity,  I've thought I'll cash in on that.  Yeah, you might as well.  You'll get people down there to see you because they like your animated character.  Right, exactly.  And I'm quite animated on stage, which people are always impressed by.  When I can't get a laugh, I will just do a funny face, a funny dance.  So I have no shame.  I'm happy to do that.  So have you been going on and just working out material?  Well, I just did a tour in the UK, which I've just finished.  And I did a little show last night here in New York.  But it's the first time I've ever performed in America.  So it's kind of weird to just – it's not just a question of changing pavement to sidewalk. 
[02:01:30]  It feels like there's a whole other rhythm maybe that I've – I've only got two nights to get into.  Do you feel it?  Do you feel like, you know, like you feel that the people are giving you back some goodness?  I just feel like I – I was just talking to Sam about this because there's just a different rhythm that's not quite the same that I've sort of got to try and get used to really quickly.  You should go work out somewhere tonight or at least go to a set somewhere if you can.  Yeah, go get a few minutes and go work.  I mean, I would.  That's why I've never gone over because I'm like, I don't think they'd like me in Europe. 
[02:02:00]  My cadence is different.  I think they'd love you.  No, no, no.  But he's right.  What is it?  It's the pace.  It's a rhythm.  Something's different.  Something's different.  Yeah, I'm a little bit jumpy about that actually.  And yeah, there are certain references I've changed.  And I've got a joke which ends – in the UK it ends with the C word.  And I've been talking a lot to people because it's like it seems it's a much stronger word here.  Not on this show.  Exactly.  All jokes should begin with it.  Don't listen to them.  Do what you do.  Fuck them.  You've got to say cunt.  You've got to say cunt.  But it does mean a lot more here. 
[02:02:30]  But that whole Laurie thing and Lou, you know, that doesn't work.  No, that doesn't make any sense.  It's a truck and a bathroom.  I understand, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks because I've got a big routine about it.  About the lavatories at truck stops.  Which would have destroyed you because that's a lot of Laurie and Lou and Lou and Lou.  Yeah, and the fag, fag thing is confusing.  Fag thing.  That gets a lot of people.  Some of them love it.  Some of them are very confused.  Exactly.  Oh, and you see a comic do ten minutes on that and how the mix-ups can happen.  It's such as –  Very integrity-driven. 
[02:03:00]  Integrity-driven.  Ricky's doing stand-up.  Have you seen him do stand-up?  I've seen him do stand-up in the past.  I haven't seen his latest stuff that he's working on.  But, yeah, no, I always try and go see the shows.  I don't think he comes to see my shows.  He tends to be asleep by, you know, nine.  Oh, really?  Really?  Yeah, he's an early – he likes to be in his pajamas by sort of six.  Wow.  And, yeah, he doesn't go out much late at night.  So –  Yeah.  He tweets a lot.  He does a lot of tweeting.  I don't look at tweeting a lot.  You're not a tweeting guy?  Well, I do it just for the tour I've been tweeting, but I find it too weird. 
[02:03:30]  Which one are you, by the way?  Because people are trying to figure it out.  Yeah, there's one – SM Hello Ladies.  That's you, okay.  That's the real me.  There's a lot of – there's imposters.  Do you have imposters?  Yeah.  This is a weird phenomenon, it seems.  It really is, yeah, yeah.  And when you're verified, you don't have to deal with that.  You're verified?  Yeah.  How did you get verified?  That's just what I do.  I can't.  But I can't be bothered to tweet.  And I am me.  Like, the idea that there's someone else who's pretending to be me doing more tweeting than I am.  And often far more amusing than I ever was.  They have to live their life and your life. 
[02:04:00]  But what mindset is that?  It's so bizarre to me.  It really is.  It's so strange that you wake up and you think, I would love to pretend to be Steve Murchison.  There doesn't seem to be a reason.  Are they pretending to be you or are they saying shitty things that you would never say?  No, not at all.  No, they're saying things like, just had dinner with Carl.  Just like kind of things that might happen.  A lunatic.  It's so strange.  Creepy.  Isn't that weird?  Yeah, people.  I can see when they're attacking people.  Like, they'll have like, what was some celebrity that were like, not him, like Gary Busey or something. 
[02:04:30]  They were saying, I guess.  That makes sense.  You see, yeah, if you want to bad mouth someone.  But just to masquerade as them and imagine what they might write.  And then write something similar.  Right.  That's creepy.  Do you feel like there's, the internet has, like, were we always this crazy as a civilization?  No.  And the internet has just revealed to us how crazy we all are?  I don't think so.  Or has it bred craziness?  I think it's bred craziness.  It's opened it up.  It's like one of those, you know, you put your toe in the water and in time your whole body will be in the water. 
[02:05:00]  At the onset of this social networking, it was just a toe in the water.  You didn't feel like giving out that much.  It was an anonymous post on a website was fine.  And now it's like, hey, this is absolutely me.  Right.  You know it's me.  And I'm going to post pictures from my house and tell you what the argument I got in and tell you what I ate.  Right.  Like, first of all, who really cares?  Yeah.  And secondly, why do we feel so compelled to put our lives out there?  It's so strange.  Every minutia.  But not just with that.  Like, was there as many pedophiles in the 50s as there are there? 
[02:05:30]  Like, is it people just, like, going online thinking, well, I mean, I've heard a lot about it.  Or just, I'll see if it takes my fancy.  But again, you know, when you dip your toe in that water, it doesn't take long before you're diving all the way in.  You know what it is?  We've always been this crazy.  We've always, look at, look at.  Do you think?  Yes.  I mean, they used to put people on their heads and open their legs and saw through their vaginas and penises.  When was this?  In the Middle Ages.  I've never heard that.  That was a torture method.  That was your people back in the old European days. 
[02:06:00]  That was one of the methods.  They would open your legs.  Was that a torture method?  The Spanish Inquisition?  It wasn't a reward when they would saw through your crotch.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm an idiot.  But, I mean, we've always been this crazy.  We've always been nuts.  But now we're, we're now more open about it.  Right.  We're just a little bit more open.  We used to hide it better, I guess.  And we want to connect with each other.  We want to learn more about each other.  We're like a bunch of, do we really want to learn about other people?  We're a bunch of weird little animals coming out of holes.  I think we want to be heard more than we want to listen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, fair enough.  I like the fact that people will tweet things and just not even acknowledge what has been 
[02:06:30]  written by other people.  Yeah, right.  It's not this exchange of ideas.  It's everyone yelling, please look at me.  It's a me, me, me mentality.  That's kind of what this whole thing has turned into.  And I don't know where it's headed from here, but it'll be interesting.  Well, it's like, there's always the comment sections on online versions of newspapers.  You'll see an article and then there'll be like a series.  And then they get into arguments with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck you.  You're an asshole.  It's so weird.  It's all with fake names, by the way, which drives especially Jimmy the fake names I hate.  People have this just, they want to be heard. 
[02:07:00]  And now more than ever, we were talking about when people used to have to get in touch with  a celebrity, even for a picture.  Clark Gable.  You wanted to fucking get a letter to Clark Gable.  You could write one.  That letter wasn't going to Clark Gable.  It was going to his people.  They were going to take a picture that he'd signed or they stamped and send it out.  You could never say, hey, Clark, love this movie you did.  Or I thought Gone with the Wind sucked.  You know, whatever.  Now, you go to Twitter, you directly have access to these celebrities to go, your movie sucked. 
[02:07:30]  And he might just go, fuck you.  I think the movie was great.  It gives you this access to people that we never had before.  But it's also, it's cheap and celebrity in a way, and particularly movie stars.  Like, it used to be that Clark Gable was untouchable.  Untouchable.  He was a god.  You were never getting to Clark Gable.  You were never going to see Clark Gable coming out of a bar drunk.  And that's all you, yeah, drunk.  You weren't going to see that ever.  Camera in his face.  So, Clark, what are you doing tonight, man?  Hey, fuck you.  You don't give a damn.  We don't. 
[02:08:00]  Well, it seemed Clark didn't give a damn that night about drinking.  Oh, they're all TMZ.  They're going crazy.  It's like that TMZ show where they're all stood around, like, appearing to just, like,  ad-lib a conversation in the audience.  Oh, it's terrible.  Hey, here I am, just bad-mouthing some people.  That fucking idiot.  Done better than me.  That roach Harvey Levin just leaning over with his stupid beverage with his straw.  Oh, it's terrible.  But it has cheapened celebrity to the point where we don't have those iconic, you know,  Humphrey Bogart.  Oh, it's not as special as it used to be. 
[02:08:30]  No.  If John Wayne was on a talk show, that was a huge...  It was huge.  We got John Wayne on a talk show now.  It's like every star is on every talk show.  Every talk show, no matter how big they are.  All right, look, man.  It was a special day for us.  He just told the same anecdote.  How many anecdotes does he have at the making of the movie?  He just put us down.  Anyone could be on a talk show.  All right, well.  It was fun for us, Stephen.  It was true.  Anyone can.  We enjoyed it.  Sorry about that.  I realize I'm pretty insulted you.  Sorry about that.  But it is an odd thing, and I think it's going to, as it moves forward, we're going to see 
[02:09:00]  some more just weirdness out of humanity.  Yeah.  It's really strange.  I like what's going on here in North Korea, having this Kim Jong-il die, because I don't  know if it's...  Do you like this?  Yeah, I like that.  Well, you were in your day, huh?  I like Kim Jong-un.  I like Kim Jong-un.  Yeah.  28 years old.  A little younger.  I think we're going to see a more hip North Korea.  We're going to be, you know, they're going to be rocking the iPhones and the iPads.  Sure.  One of those Apple adverts.  Yes, yeah.  Well, they're all just, you know, smiling people. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  You know, they've used dead people in ads before.  It's going to be Kim Jong-il just, you know, using his iPad.  It's nice that there's only one word different in his name as well.  Like, we haven't got to change everything in our mindset.  It's Kim Jong.  What's the guy from Korea?  Kim Jong?  Kim Jong.  Is it on?  On.  On.  Yeah.  A lot of the stationery doesn't have to be changed.  But he's 28.  So you're getting a younger leader.  I don't know when he's actually going to take power. 
[02:10:00]  I think there might be some shenanigans going on over there before this kid actually goes in.  And you know this how?  Because the internet, all of my travels to North Korea.  He knows this shit now.  I know because I have a microphone in front of me.  When I speak into it, what comes out of people's radios has to be true.  It's on the radio.  Of course, yeah.  So that's the only.  It was fascinating, though, the North Korea.  Like, it's such a fascinating place.  Shut off from the rest of the world.  Unbelievable.  Even with the advent of all this social networking and mass communications.  I mean, even the Soviet Union at the time, back then, couldn't keep it all from info from the West coming in. 
[02:10:30]  China is having the same type of problem keeping their people in check because they see the rest of the world.  But North Korea could shut down everything coming into that fucking country.  And do you remember that weird thing?  I was fascinated by that story where Kim Jong-il was a big movie buff.  And he kidnapped a husband and wife film directing team from, like, South Korea.  And kidnapped them and brought them to North Korea and made them make films.  That's hilarious.  It's just, like, it's the best. 
[02:11:00]  It's like the worst kind of James Bond villain.  Right, right.  He wants to make a movie.  How long did he keep him there for?  They were there for years.  And eventually, I think, he foolishly let them go to, like, a film festival somewhere else in the world.  And they just ran away.  So strange.  Wow.  And you can't make shitty films because that'll be your life.  Imagine being so good at something that they steal you to make movies.  Like, I can't get into one on any fucking way.  How humiliating.  Waiting for a dictator to kidnap you. 
[02:11:30]  What I'm trying to do is be the English guy that people go to when they can't get Simon Pegg.  Oh, yeah.  This is what I'm trying to do.  You could work that out.  I'm hoping they'll be, like, a rip-off version of Mission Impossible.  You know, like, Mission Difficult.  It's just difficult.  It's not impossible.  We could get Simon Pegg.  How well do you know Simon Pegg?  Pretty well.  Yeah?  I see you call him Peggy.  You've got to know the guy pretty well to call him Peggy.  He's a lovely man, Simon Peggy.  He's fucking very good.  Yeah.  Really good.  Like, the first thing I saw him, and I think a lot of people were Shaun of the Dead,  and then you realize how much he had in making that movie, not just acting it. 
[02:12:00]  It's like, wow, that's fucking smart.  Then you realize, why wasn't he around longer?  Was he big in England before Shaun of the Dead?  Well, he was pretty big, yeah.  I mean, certainly among comedy fans, yeah.  Right.  He did that show Spaced.  Did you ever see Spaced?  Yeah, yeah.  It was here for a little while.  Right.  Yeah, but it was one of those English shows.  People were like, meh.  Not quite one of the...  It's no office.  It's no office.  You know how many arguments I've had about The Office, where I tell people Brent was  a better fucking character than Archie Bunker. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, please.  And people don't want to hear that shit here.  I love Archie Bunker.  He was brilliant, but David Brent was a better fucking...  A more believable human being.  Yeah, yeah.  More believable.  A more perfect character of an ass.  Yeah.  He just didn't have the racial stuff.  I'd be with Ricky walking the street when that show was on, and people would come up  and say...  Men would come up and say, I'm just like that guy you play.  See you later.  It was like a badge of honor.  Like, they were proud of it.  It was so bizarre.  It's like we always say, it didn't change anything.  There are still people like that behaving like that in offices now.  It makes no difference. 
[02:13:00]  Where did you see people like that where you were able to convey it so easily?  I went to the BBC.  It was like it there.  It's...  We always say...  Middle management.  I bet if you work at NASA or the mob, it's still the same.  I just think people are...  I was saying that years ago to Opie.  It's like, you have this impression that no matter where you work, there's a bunch of  assholes and idiots.  But there's...  The next place up has got to be different.  It'll be blissful.  And it's going to be amazing, and people will know from looking at all the assholes at  the lower end of the jobs how to do it when you get to the upper end. 
[02:13:30]  But then, as I kept progressing in my career, I realized, wow, everyone's stupid, and this  never changes the whole thing.  It never gets better.  But then you start thinking about shit you're not in, like the government and things like  NASA and stuff.  And realize, no, it's the same cubicle idiots that...  That's the terrifying thing about the...  Yeah.  You know the people in power are exactly the same.  And you realize...  Petty...  Yeah.  It's barely hanging together by a thread.  Of course.  We are...  It's...  Because...  Also, I think with politics, it's like...  It is that thing of who'd want to be a member of that... 
[02:14:00]  You know, if you want to be in the club, you shouldn't be in the club.  It's like...  Right.  If you think...  I mean, you know, God bless President Obama, but who wants to be the president?  No, no.  It's insane.  The responsibility is crazy.  That's why I think the people that would be best suited to be president would never  run for president.  They're too smart to look at that office and go, for the amount of money he's getting and  the amount of aggravation, no one ever just pours accolades onto the president.  I mean, talk about receiving some bad-mouthing on Twitter.  Oh! 
[02:14:30]  Wow!  Does he go on Twitter?  Do you think, oh my God, they really did.  That was a high policy.  Yeah.  You captured something, too, in the extras, too.  It was like, you had this great way of capturing, like, the really arrogant, annoying side of  a person, but it also...  It was a complete person.  It was like, he wasn't a caricature of an annoying guy.  Like, uh...  And you had a great role in that as well as the agent.  But there was a real person there.  It's like, wow, you really feel for him sometimes, and you can understand why he's an asset.  People used to say we were really cynical, and the shows we did were kind of black comedies,  and that they were cynical.  But I think there's always a real... 
[02:15:00]  I hope there's a warmth towards those characters.  Even with David Brent, like you were saying earlier, we feel there's a humanity in them  that is interesting to us.  The worst people have something about them that is likable, and that's kind of interesting,  and that friction is what's interesting.  You laugh at him.  You're definitely laughing at him as anybody else would, but you also feel bad, and you're  thinking if that was, like, a real character, he would be the most pathetic thing and sad  man to be walking around. 
[02:15:30]  And that's another great line when he's trying to impress the new guy at the office, and  he tells Dawn that she's being fired, and then he has to confess and say it was a joke,  and she's like, you're a sad man.  You're a sad man.  But his response is, am I?  Like, that's such a real...  The writing in that, it makes me sick.  It's so good.  Like, I would have tried to write a punchline, or fucking when he's holding the dildo,  whose is this?  And he's holding it in the girl's face.  But there's no dildo puns.  There's no dumb fucking jokes.  It is just that awful moment.  And it's like, that's what great comedy is. 
[02:16:00]  It's like, oh, Jesus.  And of course, when the answering machine falls in the garbage.  That's my favorite moment in the whole series.  It's one of the great...  But I think it's the thing, if it wasn't done as a fake documentary, a lot of that stuff  wouldn't make sense, because it's the fake...  It's knowing that there's this camera crew there that he's showing off to.  He's showing off.  It's a huge thing.  And again, like we were saying, nothing changes.  Your reality TV, the number of people who go on reality TV, and it's like they think, having  had no education, I could...  Well then, I'm not going to look like an asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  I know how this works. 
[02:16:30]  I'll be the one that comes off looking great.  And it's such incredible.  People keep volunteering to go on reality shows.  Yeah.  They keep on being made to look like dicks.  Every week.  Do you like the American version of The Office?  I love it.  You do?  Yeah.  Do you like it as much as The British?  I mean, you guys are kind of, I guess, exec producers on it, right?  But I just wanted to sound like I was on TV.  So you like it as much as The British?  Or do you think it...  Well, I do because I never could enjoy The British as a fan.  You know what I mean?  So whereas I really enjoy it as a fan, the American show.  You pretty much knew every line that was coming out.  Often.  Often I did.  Often.  Do you watch yourself and enjoy it? 
[02:17:00]  That's a corny question.  I can't bear it.  You can't?  I can't even.  Really?  Wow, that's weird.  I can't bear to hear myself on the radio or watch myself on TV, anything like that.  I just can't.  Because all I see is the mistakes.  Right.  The witty thing I should have said.  Yeah, yeah.  That is a weird thing because whenever I listen to replays of shows or something,  I never sound like the guy that's on the radio.  Like, I sound like, ah, they should throw me out at any minute.  But apparently, I guess to the listeners, you sound like the guy on the radio because  you're the guy on the radio. 
[02:17:30]  And it's got to be the same on television.  You're looking and just, you're so taken out of the show because you're in it.  Of course, exactly.  And all you remember is the mechanics of it.  The, we had to break for lunch there.  If only we'd done a couple more takes.  Or, you know, I remember I was in a foul mood.  Or, you know, that's all I see.  I can't, all I see is the nuts and bolts of it.  But not ten years down the road, maybe I'll revisit.  It sounds good from what I've heard.  It's not bad.  I literally have watched it so many times.  Like, you know, you don't even laugh at the joke because you know the joke.  Right.  But I just enjoy it as watching a guy portray a fool. 
[02:18:00]  So, like, Rupert Pupkin was a great one.  De Niro did a great job.  Oh, man, yeah.  But that was more of a caricature.  And this is like a fucking, a real documentary.  I mean, you know that.  And, uh, and extras.  What a brilliant role to take on.  Just, you never think about these fucking people.  You mentioned that it's like a real documentary because we, at the time, there were real documentaries  coming on and we were like, we remember calling each other saying, we can't compete with the  real thing.  It's true.  Real documentaries are, when they are good, they are off the charts.  Yeah.  Did you see that one, um, King of Kong?  Oh, yeah.  We love King of Kong. 
[02:18:30]  Those characters you couldn't write.  Could not write it.  That guy.  It's like, okay, we want you to write a character.  It's like a video game guy.  It's years later.  He set the record.  Here he is.  What type of person would he be?  You couldn't write a big asshole like that.  Oh, Billy Mitchell.  Billy Mitchell is the key.  Billy Mitchell is the key.  Oh, minor villain that anyone has ever heard.  Fantastic.  Just the hair, the...  Oh, the ties, the bad ties.  You can't write that.  There's a lot where he said something like, um, he said something like, uh, they say  you learn a lot from losing.  I should try sometime.  He's all smug when he says it. 
[02:19:00]  Unbelievable.  Not a hint of irony.  No.  No wink to the camera.  No.  That's what he believes.  He meant it.  He thinks people love...  Uh, some people getting mad because we're talking about shows that are old.  Yeah, we know.  Come on.  I've never gotten to talk to Stephen Merchant about this masterpiece.  But we wanted to make sure people know about Life's Too Short.  Which is, uh, your new project, right?  Right, like, it's a show we did that's coming on HBO in February.  And, uh, it's a show we did with, uh, the actor Warwick Davis.  Are you familiar with Warwick?  He was in, uh, Harry Potter and Return of the Jedi. 
[02:19:30]  And he's, uh, a little person.  And, um, and we worked with him on extras.  And, uh, Ricky kicked him in the face on that show.  On TV, not in the dressing room.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah, so it's a whole show kind of following him.  Again, fake documentary star.  Ricky and I pop up as ourselves.  And a little like extras, we've got some celebrity names in it.  So Liam Neeson is in an episode.  And, uh, Johnny Depp and Sting and people.  And, uh, Liam Neeson is absolutely hysterical.  That fucking Liam Neeson clip where he's, yeah, talking about, uh, comedy. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, and he wants to break into comedy.  And so he's trying to do some improv comedy with Ricky.  It's hilarious.  It's one of the funniest fucking clips I've seen on the internet.  Great.  Because it's so out of place.  Like, I didn't think he had a sense of humor.  He's amazing.  He's absolutely amazing.  He's making, like, AIDS jokes and shit.  It's just the least appropriate comedy routine.  Is he funny?  He's not trying, it's not coming off like, look, I'm being funny.  Right, right.  But he's hilarious doing it.  I can't wait to watch this.  Yeah.  And it's not by accident.  Like, he knows what he's doing.  Oh, he knows what he's doing.  It's brilliant.  Really good. 
[02:20:30]  He never had an opportunity to do that before, obviously.  I guess not.  You know, he's always been like the hard guy.  When you get someone like that on a show, their public image is someone so intense, Oscar  Schindler, that when you can make them do things on TV, it's great.  Holy shit.  Life's too short coming out on HBO.  Yeah, we had, what's his name in here a couple of weeks ago.  Fuck.  He was in The Professional.  Gary Oldman.  Oh, Gary Oldman, yeah.  Gary Oldman was in here.  The nerve of us to forget his name. 
[02:21:00]  I know.  You know what it is?  When you're trying to think of a name, you can never think of a fucking name.  But he was in here, and not known as being a funny guy, but he was funny, and just genuinely  fun to be around, and telling his stories, and laughing and stuff.  All I'm thinking is the guy in The Professional, you know.  Right, exactly.  Get everyone here.  Oh, what do you mean?  Everyone!  Taking those popper drugs and shit.  Where the old lady comes out, he goes, get back inside, and then he fucking shoots  the window next to her.  I told you to get back inside.  It's fucking great. 
[02:21:30]  That movie, I think, was, what, 12 years old?  Yeah, yeah.  There's some people on your email that are really going to hate that.  Yes.  Sort of like Clark Gable.  Well, yeah, Clark Gable.  You know, The Wizard of Oz.  Let's go back.  Talking about little people.  The Wizard of Oz had a few.  Do you have an opening act, and do you just stand up?  Or do you just go out and do the 90 minutes for yourself?  I'm normally trying to have an opening act.  You do, right?  It helps.  Just to sort of ease into and stuff.  I'm jumpy about these.  Nah, you'd be fine, man.  You really will.  Yeah, I don't know.  I love American comedy. 
[02:22:00]  I grew up adoring American comedy, particularly that sort of New York, wise-ass Jewish humor,  you know, Woody Allen and that stuff, Jack Benny.  And I just always...  There's something about the American, the way Americans speak, the sort of rhythms of American  speech that lend itself to a particular kind of humor.  Like, there's a great Woody Allen joke in Broadway, Danny Rose, where he's saying, my aunt, not  an attractive woman.  She looked like something you'd buy in a live bait store.  We would never say something in England like live bait store. 
[02:22:30]  It would have a kind of long, like a fishing tackle equipment supplier.  Do you know what I mean?  There's nothing kind of neat and compact about English, English.  But the English comics, you guys have this type of delivery and the cadence in the voice  that is conducive to English comics.  I guess so.  Which is that whole, you know, like, almost like you're looking down your nose at us.  Right.  You know, but it's funny, I mean, and completely acceptable.  Fawlty Towers, I thought, was hilarious. 
[02:23:00]  1975.  Yes, let's go back.  1975.  Fawlty Towers was a huge influence on me.  Because John Cleese grew up right near where I grew up in Bristol in England.  And he was a big influence on me.  Because the way he was smart, but physical.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Again, the funny walks and stuff.  Amazing.  The way he would deliver his lines.  And just when he'd be mad, how detailed he'd get into, like, just giving it to somebody.  And then maybe losing his train of thought and getting pissed at himself at the end of it.  Well, we were talking about David Brennan.  I think there's a long tradition of kind of American sitcom, sorry, English sitcom characters 
[02:23:30]  that have that, he's a very similar type, you know.  And I think what was different in those days was that they aspired to be in high society.  That was the thing.  In the 60s and 70s, you wanted to be, you know, hanging out with royals and the mayor.  Now, I think it's you want to be celebrity.  And I think that's what David Brent was in a way.  That the new thing, the new urge is to be famous.  Be famous.  That's the high society of the modern age.  Well, he used performer lingo, which just, it makes you fucking, it humiliates you for him.  Like, when he's telling Neil, he goes, just go out and talk and then bring me on. 
[02:24:00]  Like, bring me on.  Like, he's a fucking comic.  And those awful jokes, he's like, paper, blew away.  The paper shop blew away.  And it's just, it's bombing horribly.  And the phone rings.  He goes, all right, that's why you're not enjoying it.  Because, oh, shut up.  It's perfection.  It's perfect uncomfortability.  So, do you, you do get a little nervous when you go on stage?  I think I will here in the stage.  Just because I, as I say, I'm sort of inexperienced performing in America.  I do some gritty New York humor. 
[02:24:30]  Like, I'll go out there, I'll just go like, well, these cabs.  What are these guys from crazy places?  That'll do it.  Oh, yeah.  Get them hard.  Imagine if he had that exact joke written.  Put it tilled because he said it right there.  Got to get rid of this.  I'm not above some cheap observations.  I'll do anything.  When I'm up on stage, I'm so desperate to make people laugh.  I will pander mercilessly.  Just go anywhere.  I don't care.  Good for you.  Anything.  You know, it's all very easy in the writing room trying to be really clever and smart.  But when you're out on stage and they're just looking at you. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  I'm dying to see.  I'm going to come one of those nights.  Oh, yeah.  Tomorrow or Wednesday.  Let's do this.  Stephen Merchant at Town Hall.  Town Hall.  I guess their 8 o'clock show.  It's an amazing venue on 43rd Street.  Yeah.  And it's a very intimate place to see a show.  Great.  And I didn't even know you did stand-up.  I'm happy to hear that you do it.  Thank you, man.  Because I would love to come and...  Yes, you're welcome.  Yeah.  Listen, I can probably get you half-priced seats.  I'll appreciate that.  That's a bargain.  Two for one.  Yes.  I've already scalped for double, so I'll just take them and sell them back to the man.  Is the animated show on HBO?  Yes.  I think that starts again next year.  So I'm so terrible at keeping track of what it is I'm doing. 
[02:25:30]  It's just like, I know I did it, so it's going to turn up somewhere.  That's done really well, too.  That's a fun thing to do.  Yeah.  It's just...  I don't know who's doing the animating, but it's amazing.  They're great.  And they're so inventive.  And they just take it into another realm.  Yeah, yeah.  Because the podcast itself is very funny.  And then you add that visual element of the cartoons, and it just becomes ridiculous.  Well, Carl Pilkington has such a sort of vivid imagination.  And I think...  Has it been on the one where he comes up with a movie for Tom Cruise, where Tom Cruise gets 
[02:26:00]  like in another person's brain or something?  I've seen a couple of those themes where he comes up with movies.  Every movie idea he has is always the same.  Like someone going in another person's brain.  Another brain.  Yeah.  Carl rules.  The one where, yeah, the woman was dead.  Yeah.  But you could take her brain out and put it in someone else's body.  Someone else's body, and so the love can continue.  He just comes out with shit.  And I was saying when we weren't on the air earlier that you could ask him a question  or put him in a situation where you would 99% of the time know what anyone would do. 
[02:26:30]  Right.  And you're almost saying like, oh, I know what line's coming next.  Yeah.  And he will go so far in another direction that...  It's never what you think.  No.  And that's what makes it so funny and just so perplexing to watch him.  I think as a comedy writer as well, it's like you...  You're sort of constrained a bit by your own intelligence and your own smartness.  Do you know what I mean?  Whereas he's just like so ill-informed.  He will come out of left field with such...  I think we spoke last time about how he was talking about the pyramids, and he was saying 
[02:27:00]  it's such a terrible design.  You know, kind of huge living room, tiny bedrooms.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like, I know it's a mausoleum, so it would never occur to me that it's a house.  Of course.  Why would you even think that?  That his take on bugs gets me every time.  He's obsessed with bugs.  Does he hate them or love them?  No, he kind of has an affinity for him, but he thinks about how they think.  He can't conceive of the idea that a bug is just doing what it does.  Right.  It's not thinking like a human.  I got to do... 
[02:27:30]  I got to lift this twig today.  Yeah, he's always thinking that.  I didn't sleep well.  I had a fight with my wife.  He's obsessed with the idea that they...  He's just one of many in the colony, and it upsets him that he's like...  And you're like, no, he doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  He's not thinking.  How do you know?  Exactly.  Of course, that's it.  It's just...  It really is great.  Ants and bees don't give a shit about individuality.  No.  Couldn't care less.  He's great, though.  What a brilliant find.  I've never heard him, because I've never heard the find.  I know who he is, and...  Idiot Abroad is a great show, too. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, when they sent him to...  What was it?  The Dead Sea?  Right.  And he's floating next to snot.  There's a snot fucking wad, because it's apparently disgusting.  There's so much salt in it that everything floats.  So he just got in there, and he's like, oh, I'm floating, but he's talking on the phone.  And as he's doing it, there's these old men just hacking up shit, and there's a blob of mucus  that's right next to him, and he's trying to shoo it away from him.  Because it doesn't sink.  It all just hangs out on the surface.  It was so disgusting.  But just the way he handled it was... 
[02:28:30]  Did it see?  Can you float on it?  Oh, my God.  You can't sink if you wanted to.  Can you go underwater there?  I guess for a second.  It's really salty, though.  Yeah, it's really salty.  Yeah, close your mouth.  It's just like you float more.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's a real ocean, right?  Oh, yeah.  The more amazing about that show was Machu Picchu.  I said it to you last time.  He didn't even have the desire to check it out.  Well, that I find weird, that lack of curiosity.  You're sending it to amazing places.  Total lack of curiosity.  How are you not curious enough to now walk around?  He saw it from afar.  He's like, yeah, this is close enough. 
[02:29:00]  Well, his argument now is with high-definition TV, why would you go anywhere?  I understand that rationale.  I mean, if you don't want to eat the food and meet with the local people, then yeah, I guess  you'll see it in better conditions.  I'm obsessed because I want to go to Machu Picchu, and here's Carl.  He's there, and almost there, and decided he did enough for the TV show, and just wanted  to get down.  I'm like, what?  Who does that way?  Carl.  Well, I get furious with him because he does stuff which I would love to do, you know, swimming  with sharks.  Yeah.  Part of the thing with the show is we slightly screw with him, so we told him he was going 
[02:29:30]  to swim with dolphins, and when he got there, it was sharks, which kind of annoyed  him somewhat.  It annoys him so much, just the littlest things, which is hilarious, too.  No, he's remarkable.  Yeah.  You've had great success in the States.  I'm happy to see it.  Thank you.  Really happy.  It's always happy to see guys that are really smart and funny doing clever stuff.  Yeah, man.  Really clever.  Really, really original shit.  It's so good to see.  We're starting to get more clever stuff on TV, finally, but it's not easy.  Oh, there's still so much.  No, I know.  It's not easy.  The grass is always greener, though. 
[02:30:00]  I think, you know, there's so much terrible stuff on UK TV as well.  You see the best of it, hopefully, but I still admire American TV.  I don't think we're doing stuff of the quality of Mad Men or The Sopranos on British TV.  You know, I think, just enjoy what you've got, guys.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, man.  If nothing else, you know, just take that message away from you.  They have taken more of an attitude that you get in film on television here.  Yes, exactly.  And I think it's because the stations knew they couldn't compete anymore. 
[02:30:30]  I think a lot of the stuff that you used to see in American cinema in, like, the 70s,  kind of brave, personal movies, five-easy pieces and stuff like that.  Brian Song.  Brian Song.  It feels like that's what they're making on TV, on HBO and cable channels and stuff,  whereas American cinema, I guess, is perhaps less adventurous than it used to be.  Yeah, and with FX and channels that allow for a little more graphic content.  Nudity, ideally.  Who doesn't like it?  This is one of the reasons I never watch animated films, because there's never any nudity.  No. 
[02:31:00]  Nothing's pleasurable enough.  How great would Up have been with a clit in it?  Well, English television has had nudity in it for years, and that, to us, especially growing  up, when I used to put on Channel 13, which is our educational television here, and brought  us things like Monty Python and whatnot, there was plenty of nudity in that.  Well, there was occasional nudity.  There was a lot of underwear.  Believe me, it was a lot more than we were getting on any channels in the United States.  Aside from maybe Ronan Martin's laughing, we'd get Goldie Hawn in a bikini painted in psychedelic 
[02:31:30]  colors, but other than that, you know, you could get, even if it was that kind of clip  art shit they used to do on Monty Python, where they'd have the nude woman.  Yeah, it's like, for that age, at that time, it was like, fuck, I didn't have the internet.  This was huge.  Wasn't Benny Hill more sexual than Monty Python?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was sort of running around, girls chasing him in their underwear.  Giant tits in their underwear.  We loved Benny Hill.  Is that kind of hack for you guys?  How old is that now?  It's pretty old.  It was always fascinating that Benny Hill was huge over here. 
[02:32:00]  I mean, he was big in England as well, but it's such an odd...  Was it hack though for you guys?  It became an ironic thing, though, here.  It wasn't like...  I don't think we were watching it like, wow, this is...  It was kind of a goofy old guy.  But also, it was titillating, because, you know, this was before the internet and everything  else.  That's how we got to see our tits.  The little stupid old man just hitting his head.  This is very funny.  I mean, it was kind of wacky.  There must be a lot of men of a certain age who have been kind of slightly corrupted sexually,  but if that was their only exposure to women... 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, the big...  The nurses with the big boobs.  Yeah, it was always nurses chasing him.  Yeah, fast motion.  Yeah, fast motion.  It was some sick shit.  Yeah, maybe that's the whole thing I got on.  The phobia of nurses.  I was surprised to find out he was gay.  I didn't know that.  Then he was?  I did not know that, yeah.  Oh, you're making implications.  Yeah, I've heard that.  I know he sort of died quite sort of lonely and...  Oh, did he?  ...in a little sort of council house, you know, with like no sort of money or...  No money?  Or his money was squirreled away, you know, under the mattress or something.  There was something about those guys from that age who'd grown up sort of on the stage  and stuff who were just upset.  Like, money was... 
[02:33:00]  They just wouldn't put it in a bank.  They couldn't trust a bank.  Yeah, yeah.  They grew up in the 30s.  He was just, you have to hang on to your money to die.  You're holding your money.  Like an old prospector.  They could end up in another depression and lose it all.  Just put it in my mattress, ticking.  Wait, was he a stage actor?  He's a stage comedian.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I guess our equivalent of sort of vaudeville, they would have started on.  You know what I like from England, too?  We had him in Chris Morris.  I think he's really good.  Chris Morris is a genius.  Oh my God, we love him.  He's brilliant, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  He, uh, that Four Lions was fucking...  I didn't see Four Lions, but I...  Oh, yeah, amazing. 
[02:33:30]  Four Lions was amazing.  It didn't do well here, unfortunately.  Why would it?  You know, it was a great movie.  It was a comedy about...  Suicide Bombers.  Suicide Bombers, yeah.  That's kind of an odd subject to...  It was a hilarious movie, man.  Really good.  It was like...  I wanted to cheer when it was over.  I was watching my apartment.  I was like, good.  They didn't...  You figure they're going to fuck this up.  Like, every 20 minutes and a half hour, I'm like, he didn't fuck it up yet.  He didn't fuck it up yet.  Yeah.  Don't go for the happy ending.  Double cards, motherfucker.  Chip's guided tour through the ONA archives continues, with more unforgettable ONA appearances 
[02:34:00]  by the world's top comics coming up.  This show got me in trouble.  Of course it did.  This is A Very Chipperson Thanksgiving.  What's that?  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  The most memorable ONA appearances from the top names in comedy.  A Very Chipperson Thanksgiving continues on the Opie and Anthony channel.  This is what Ron White came on the show. 
[02:34:30]  And the guy was talking about Ron's comedy and stuff through blue collar.  That's funny stuff.  I like that.  You might be a redneck if me and my mother would try to guess what he was going to say next.  He would say, you might be a redneck if, and I would say something like, you got a bunch  of weeds in the yard or something, right, ma?  She would fucking crack up.  So Ron was there and he was talking about being a major star and he shared some stories  about Jeff Foxworthy and Bill Engvall. 
[02:35:00]  My mother likes Bill Engvall because she said, Lyle, that's a man that don't need to use dirty  language to be funny.  And there's some stories about the tour bus.  My mother one time went on Master P's tour bus.  She was there for six hours.  She said, Chippa, wait outside.  I'm going to go tell Master P and his friends how good the concert was.  And she limped off the tour bus like six hours later.  And she had a bunch of mayonnaise on her cankles. 
[02:35:30]  She said, Chippa, they're very nice young men.  Now drive me home.  What's up, Ron?  Hey, hey.  Hi, buddy.  God damn, you dress up all nice in the morning, huh?  Well, I think you guys are going out over the airwaves with this program, right?  Yeah.  Well, not TV-wise.  Oh, okay.  We kind of want a visual element.  I just did.  Imus, how was it?  The gunslinger.  How was it?  How was it?  He was awake.  How was it?  To be honest.  You know, I like the guy. 
[02:36:00]  And it was, you know, I really was kind of concerned a little bit when it first started  because he really wasn't making eye contact.  He didn't really remember I'd been on the show before twice.  But that's okay.  I mean, my brain is like an Etch-A-Sketch.  So you just shake it a little bit and it's gone.  We support Imus, but he's a tough one.  But what happened when you think we didn't see your appearance?  Was it awkward?  Because I'm a little irritated with Imus myself.  No, it was fine.  It was...  Okay. 
[02:36:30]  Are you irritated?  Oh, yeah.  He wasn't.  He was kidding, but he wasn't.  And I'm just going over my act.  Like, because I did a show recently.  And it's like, I'm a little worried about doing material that's going to get the guy fired  again.  Like, I can't do anything racial on this show.  So I'm kind of...  It's hard to do regular radio.  And I don't do...  I'm not good at doing bits on the air when I go on.  Are we on the air?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, we are?  Oh, yeah.  Is that bad?  See, that was like a natural conversation we just had.  Yeah.  That's good.  It's so smooth.  People like that.  No, it is actually.  It's funny.  No, we like it that way, to be honest with you.  But I'm not good at doing bits on the air. 
[02:37:00]  Like, I can't go on the bit and go, no, it's funny.  I was down and I'm just not good at that.  So I try to keep it conversational.  But then he's saying this morning, like...  And he was kind of kidding, but he kind of wasn't.  Like, he didn't like my appearance.  But it's like, what do you want me to do?  You want me to do my fucking Sandusky jokes on your show?  Or you want me to do the Sharpton shit I've been doing?  Come on, man.  I can't do that stuff.  I have to say your appearance was absolutely fine and it was funny.  It's not going well.  He's got to work, too.  Like, if Ron's falling flat, it's up to us to fucking work it out, too, man. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, try to draw something out of me.  It's not like, hey, here's Ron White and then you entertain everybody.  We've got to work this thing a little bit.  And I don't think I'm his works as his shit sometimes.  Well, you know, I think he kind of remembered that he liked me.  He's always been good.  I wrote a book and he's the reason it got on the New York Times bestseller  because he just came out and said all these wonderful things about it  that I couldn't even make up.  And I was like, really?  I'm that guy?  Nice.  I didn't put that much effort into that book. 
[02:38:00]  Right, right.  But anyway, yeah, it was fine.  It was fine.  Yeah, no, the only reason we're talking about this now is we just played a clip  of I'm just talking about Jimmy on the show.  He just bashed me on his show.  He kind of bashed him a little bit.  He was kind of, but again, what's a bash?  He was saying, like, a lot of these comedians come on.  And again, I don't mind his sarcastic humor because I do get that.  And they're unprepared.  And he's like, yeah, but he's like saying Carlin would come on with his laptop and stuff.  Like, first of all, I'm not Carlin in any way, but I don't do that anyway on radio.  I can't bring on, and it's not that I think I'm too good for it. 
[02:38:30]  I just don't do it well.  Yeah, I'm too good for it.  That's the difference between you and me.  He's obsessed with saying that Carlin was always well prepared for his appearances on that show.  Yeah, but I'm used to this where we're just talking and having a good time.  I'd rather talk and see what happens.  Right, me too.  Doesn't it seem awful to go on and go, you know, it's funny.  He lead me into a funny bit about San Francisco.  Yeah, I was totally not prepared to do any material, but he set me up to do it.  I mean, he goes, so what's funny these days? 
[02:39:00]  And I'm like, okay.  And then I just, and then I got to go through my brain, figure out if he wants me to do a bit, I'll do it.  I don't care.  I mean, I'm on it for publicity, you know, and funny sells, and dull doesn't sell a ticket.  So I'm just fishing through my head, and then I come up with a couple of jokes that I thought I could get away with, and then ba-da, ba-da, ba-doom.  Jimmy makes a good point, because we're friends with all the comedians, but we used to hate having comics on the show. 
[02:39:30]  Hate it.  For the reason you just brought up.  They would do bits.  They would just do bits, and I'm like, no, you're in here, you're supposedly a funny guy in general, so let's just have a conversation and see what happens.  But these guys needed the setups for their jokes and stuff.  I'm like, ah, God, no.  So we said no to comics for the longest time.  Yeah, because when you go in, you know how it is, man.  It's like you go in and do a, it just, it doesn't feel natural to talk to two or three people in the room like it would to talk to, you know, in my case, 80, in your case, 10,000.  But you know what I'm saying?  It doesn't feel as natural to communicate like that. 
[02:40:00]  Enough of all that.  That's fine.  We made our point.  We had Vic Henley in last week.  I thought he was coming on today, too.  He said he's sick.  I tried to get him to come out and party with me last night, and he wouldn't do it.  Oh, then he's got to be sick.  Yeah, he's got some kind of flu.  You don't want to be around him.  He came out to Radio City, and he opened Radio City for me last time I was here.  Right.  And luckily, he was off.  He's a dear friend, so he came out and hung with us.  All right, now we believe him because we thought he was just bullshitting.  Yeah, well, we did get tore up. 
[02:40:30]  No, I know you guys go way back.  How was Radio City?  It was great.  You know, it's kind of a big room to steer, you know, just for one guy standing on stage.  You know, usually when that show's, you know, there's a show there, there's a lot of things  going on, you know.  So, you know, so it's not my favorite room to work, but it's still, you know, I'm from  a town of, you know, about 700 people in Northwest Texas with dirt streets to this day.  So it's a big deal for me to do it, you know.  And I know a lot of people think, hey, well, it's just Radio City. 
[02:41:00]  But to me, it's Radio City.  Of course.  That's a big gig, man.  That's a fucking great gig.  How many people in there?  It's like 5,000, 6,000.  That's a big gig.  Yeah, we had sold out 50, we were about 5,700.  Oh, that's awesome.  And so, and it was a blast.  I worked really slow and, you know, it didn't bother me, you know, to do it.  It's just another room, but it's on one level.  But it is awfully big to steer.  I don't really, you know, I play the Fox in Atlanta, which is almost that big. 
[02:41:30]  The Fox in Detroit, St. Louis.  And they're just not my favorite.  I'm more comfortable with about 1,700 to 2,500 people.  And that's, you know, just easier to steer.  What's the biggest gig you ever had?  20,000.  Now, how was that?  Well, it was at the, oh, not the Thomas and Mac.  It was where the Predators play hockey in Nashville.  And the Gaylord Center is what it used to be.  I don't know what it is now, Brickstone or something.  But that was with Blue Collar, so it wasn't just me.  But we set the attendance record for that building and still have it today. 
[02:42:00]  And it probably can't be beat because we had a small stage right in the middle of it.  And we beat Elton John and the other piano.  Yeah, Billy Joel.  Yeah, Billy Joel.  But they just had a bigger stage.  Right, right.  That's all.  That's the only reason we beat them.  That was an amazing tour.  And I didn't realize, because I don't really watch a lot of comedy TV, but I didn't realize  that you didn't do Blue Collar TV.  Like, did you, when the tour was over, were you just done with the concept of it, or did  you just not want to do TV? 
[02:42:30]  Well, you know, there were more than one contributing factor.  One, I'd just become a, you know, really popular comedian.  And so my retirement plan up until that point was maybe something needle happened.  That was my whole plan.  I was banking on that.  And so then something neat happened, and I wanted to go do stand-up.  I didn't want to do television.  I did a couple episodes of it.  And it, you know, and then there's a lot of strain between, you know, their manager and 
[02:43:00]  me.  Their manager's just a dick.  Oh, Dick doesn't like him either, I think, right?  No, no, nobody does.  No, he's a genuine, genuine asshole.  So how does he have clients?  Well, you know, he makes them rich.  That's how he does it.  But he's a genuine asshole anyway.  And, you know, he wants a lapdog type client, and I'm more of an in-your-face type client.  So it just doesn't work out.  And he hates me with just, I don't have the energy to hate him as much as he hates me. 
[02:43:30]  I would like to hate him that much, but I don't have time.  You know, I gotta, you gotta muster it up.  What is that all about?  If my manager or agent interfered with something I was doing on TV with other performers, I  would call and say, if you fuck with me on a TV gig, I'll fucking fire you.  What are you doing?  Why does he hate you so much?  Oh, yeah, because I got in his face.  And he's just, we had put just film Blue Collar 2.  We were finished with it.  And we were all in a bar in Denver, and I mean, the whole cast, everybody, sound, lights. 
[02:44:00]  We were all there just having our big after party.  And I'm just snot drunk on scotch and pot, and, you know, I'm loaded.  Well, he likes to pester the fuck out of me, you know, and he'd always bring up that I was  just an overpaid opening act, and, I mean, just, which, you know, at the time I was.  But anyway, he just knew how to needle me, and, but what happened was, since Blue Collar 
[02:44:30]  1, he wasn't, he wasn't fucking with a broke comedian that needed his help, you know.  I was making money, so, you know, he said it, and I got up, I'm like, fuck you, fuck  you, fuck you, I'll fuck you.  Anyway, so, now the next day, I was pretty much over it, and all these years later, he's  still not over it, you know, but he is a dick, and I wouldn't, he, when they got back  together and toured, he was the producer of it, so I wouldn't, I won't work for him. 
[02:45:00]  I mean, I couldn't, because, you know, he does everything he can to screw up my career.  He calls me my lawyers, because he'll go to them and go, if you don't, if you don't  drop Ron White as a client, I'm going to take Larry the Cable Guy away from you, who's a  bigger comic than me, and so, most of the spineless pricks did it, you know, but, you  know, lawyers, you know, they're a dime of fucking dollars.  Well, did you, because it's really, it is weird, when you're dealing with other comedians  on a, and I've done this type of stuff on a much smaller level, but sometimes you just 
[02:45:30]  got to call the other comic and go, hey man, look, let's just talk me and you, and then  sometimes they'll go and hide behind their agent, because they're pussies too, or other  times they'll go, oh, I didn't know that was happening, because sometimes, you know,  sometimes the comics don't know.  Right.  And then, genuinely, I'm a little rowdy for those boys anyway, you know, because I'm not,  you know, I smoke pot pretty openly, and they all have, you know, some corporate work that  they do, and I don't, I don't get any corporate work, nobody's looking for an overweight alcoholic 
[02:46:00]  that smokes and tusses, nobody.  How's the pot?  I hear it's really strong these days.  I've been pretty clean for a while.  Yeah, I'm using medical marijuana to get off of regular marijuana, that's what I'm, that's  what I'm doing, and it's working too, because I don't even hardly think about regular weed  anymore, it's just so shitty.  Fucking Ron is like a rock star, man, he really, you're one of the, like, you're one of those  guys that is just on the road, fucking, selling again, 5,000 seats, like, what a great  career you have, man, that's a great way to go. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, yeah, well, it's, you know, there were 16 years that nobody gave a shit, and then,  Well, you're an overnight sensation, right?  I am.  How many, how many days a year on the road?  I did 148 cities last year, and I'd usually do right around 140.  How many days away from home?  Oh, I don't have any idea.  Because 148's got to, you've got to add at least another 50 on there, right?  Right, just for travel and all that shit.  But Vic Henley's like, you've got to ask about the tour bus, because you travel the country 
[02:47:00]  in style.  Right.  He says your tour bus is amazing.  Yeah.  It's great, but it's nothing like Larry the Cable Guy's bus, he got a new one, two and  a half million bucks.  Holy fuck.  Larry spent two million on a bus?  Two and a half million.  Two and a half million.  What a fucking hayseed.  Who does that?  It's amazing.  I mean, really, I just saw it, and I played his golf tournament last year, and he'd just  gotten it, and I literally, I love my bus, and it didn't make me want that bus, because  for two and a half million dollars, I got my bus and a jet for the same price. 
[02:47:30]  I got a free jet with mine, so I'm like, I'm just going to go this way, so...  Larry, what's his bus that's so great?  Yeah, what'd he get with a two and a half million dollar bus?  Does it suck your dick every night?  Quad slide it, it's got an auto suck.  Auto suck.  Yeah, plug it into the lighter there, and it sucks away.  It just, a quad slide out, it gets really big, and then it's beautiful, and then it's  got great TVs that drop down from the ceiling, you know, he's a big sports fanatic, so it's 
[02:48:00]  just, you know, it's just cool, but mine, you know, my tour manager has been my best  friend since I was six, Steve Cook, and then, you know...  Alex Ramundo opens a lot of shows for me, and he's been a friend for 25 years, and I'm  married to his sister, so it's a big family thing.  The bus driver built the bus, and the bus is cool.  I mean, it's got great audio, video.  We rockin' that thing. 
[02:48:30]  We get what we call bus fucked up, which means you gotta get, you stay sober enough to make  it to the back of the bus, which is not very goddamn sober.  Wow.  And they've got a picture of me where I didn't quite make it, and I was just kind of slumped  over the bed, passed out, and nobody woke me up, they just left me there, because I had  enough of my gut up there to stay, and just kind of balanced there for a little while.  Vic said, because I was amazed, like, because I know there's the rule, you don't shit on the  bus ever, except he said... 
[02:49:00]  Oh, that's a great story.  Steve, my buddy, he comes to work for me, and I'm looking forward to it.  I know there's a learning curve, and he's not the smartest guy in the world.  He's smart, but he's, you know, country fuck like me.  You know, so I walk into the front of the bus, and there's a bathroom in the back and a bathroom  in the front, and he has just dumped a big old stink, man, just a big old stink.  And I'm like, hey, Steve, listen, nobody shits on the bus but me.  And then he goes, okay, all right. 
[02:49:30]  I said, if you need to shit or anybody needs to shit, we'll pull over, and you go in and  shit.  And I don't want to live in your funk, you know?  And he goes, okay.  So that night, we had some people from the venue on the bus, and as soon as they get on,  Steve goes, all right, heads up.  Nobody shits on the bus but Ron.  I'm like, I was talking to you, Steve.  I wasn't talking about everybody.  It's nine o'clock at night.  Who needs to take a shit?  Nobody does.  I think I love Steve.  Yeah, Steve is great.  Steve rules.  And then Pat, my bus driver, got thrown in jail on Saturday night. 
[02:50:00]  No, Friday night in Hartford.  Why?  Well, Pat is my, he's kind of like a bodyguard, bus driver, jack of all trades.  Seven degree black belt.  Used to be, what's that frizzy headed singer guy's name?  Which one?  Could be a hundred.  The one you hate.  The, anyway, all right.  Male or female?  Oh, now I need to know.  Female.  No, male.  Male.  Country?  Rock?  No, rock, pop. 
[02:50:30]  Rock, pop.  Long, frizzy hair.  Ian Snyder?  No.  Peter Frampton?  Oh, fuck.  Now we need to know.  He's just a singer.  Oh, you know him.  I can't believe it.  My brain also works like a lazy Susan.  And it turns very slowly.  But eventually, it will come back around.  All right.  Fair enough.  Michael Bolton.  Oh, yeah.  We do hate him.  Yeah.  Right.  There you go.  Fuck that guy.  But anyway, he was his security guard for years.  And so we're sitting there watching the Predators game on my bus. 
[02:51:00]  It was almost over.  And Pat's from Nashville.  His sons all play hockey.  Two of them play professional hockey.  And we're just sitting there waiting.  And we're right in front of a bar that we're going to go into.  A blues club in Hartford.  Great club, too.  Great band.  I can't remember the name.  But it'll be back around in a minute.  And this cop just opens the door and walks into the bus.  And, you know, so he's standing there in a cloud.  And Pat's natural reaction, if anybody comes on the bus, is just to get them off the bus. 
[02:51:30]  And so they had a little bit of a physical confrontation, which was wrong of Pat.  But, you know, Pat's deal is it doesn't matter if you're dressed as a nun.  If you come on my bus with a gun, you've got to talk to him about it because that's his job.  You know, so anyway.  Are they allowed to just go on your bus like that?  You know, I don't think it held up in court.  It would have held up in court.  And I think that's why we eventually got him back. 
[02:52:00]  But, you know, he took him off the bus, slammed him up against it, handcuffed him.  And I'm like, oh, man.  And this is one of the nicest guys in the world.  This guy's just a great, raised eight kids.  They're all great kids.  You know, just handy as a shirt pocket, man.  He's just a great dude.  And I'm like, oh, surely they're not going to take him to jail.  And then somebody pulled a fire alarm.  So there's three cop cars behind my bus with lights going. 
[02:52:30]  They won't turn them out.  And then somebody pulled a fire alarm in the hotel right next to us.  So now there's five hook and ladder trucks.  There are lights everywhere.  There's big glass windows on this club that we're about to go into.  And they're just jam-packed with people with phones just recording this incident, which is fine with me.  You know, anything sells tickets.  Oh, fuck yeah.  So it's all over the web.  Oh, I didn't know that.  We should have fucking looked at.  And this is a fucking traveling comic.  I know.  That's the type of thing that happens to a band, not a fucking stand-up.  Right, yeah. 
[02:53:00]  Like I said, I'm a little rowdy.  Right.  And then also, did you hear about the high school teacher that got fired for playing one of my bits?  How long ago was that?  Two days ago, three days ago.  Oh, this is a new story.  Yeah, I don't drag around old stuff, buddy.  I fuck up every day.  We get a nice one sheet on all you guys.  And I just assume it's like the highlights of your whole career.  This just happened.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's a high school principal in Columbus, Georgia.  Was reassigned after showing members of his faculty a part of Ron White's special, You Can't Fix Stupid. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, reassigned is the wrong word.  He was fired.  He was fired.  Okay, he was fired.  Your special, You Can't Fix Stupid, that contained references to women's body parts.  Ron has publicly protested the principal, being fired, as have students.  So what part of the special did he play?  He just played the bit, You Can't Fix Stupid, which I haven't done in years.  I don't even know how it goes, but the crux of it is that if you're picking a woman, you can fix almost anything. 
[02:54:00]  If her boobs start to get big, you can have breast implants.  You can go to a titty bar and pick out a set of titties and say, I want those titties on that girl.  Right.  If your hearing goes bad, they can put something in your ear, make you hear as good as you could the day you were born.  Your tummy starts to sag.  You can have an operation that'll make you look like a cheerleader, but you can't fix stupid.  So don't marry a stupid girl because there's nothing we can do, right?  So he was using that as a motivation to go out and get these teachers.  He was saying, you can fix stupid, which, of course, you can't. 
[02:54:30]  But he was saying, give it a try while we're here.  Give it the old college try.  Right.  Go out there and try to patch this stuff back up.  So that's what they did, and they fired him.  Over that?  It doesn't sound that crazy.  It is crazy.  And you know there's somebody who had an agenda.  He's a black man.  He's a doctorate.  He does a doctorate.  He's dedicated his life to educating children in Georgia, which not a lot of people have done.  And he's just beloved by this student body.  So some cracker, I would imagine, was sick of him being their boss, and they used this as a... 
[02:55:00]  So anyway, we're going to have the Thousand Tater March.  Nice.  I'm playing there next Saturday, just by chance.  All this stuff went down.  So I'm going to get 1,000 kids, each of them holding a potato.  I don't know why.  And then you can't fix stupid signs.  We're going to have those made up.  We're going to call every news station in the world.  Good for you, man.  You know, my son's two years old, just about.  I don't know how I put him in school. 
[02:55:30]  I hate all these stories that come out.  This is one of these every fucking day.  Oh, yeah.  The political wreckedness, and, you know, the guy's trying to make his teaching a little  more interesting, and he gets fired for it?  What the fuck?  Yeah, you know, when I first...  I heard about it on my Twitter account, so it kind of came to pieces...  The information came, you know, a piece at a time.  So I thought he'd played it for the whole student body, and I'm like, fucking rock and  roll, dude.  Because it is a medium, I mean, and why not take it apart?  My son's band teacher, they studied Back in Black for six months. 
[02:56:00]  Every song on it took every song apart.  He believed it's important modern music, and it is.  It's the second biggest selling album in the history of music.  50 million copies of Back in Black.  Is that second after Thriller?  Yeah.  Is it Thriller number one?  No, Ron White is right, man.  That thing continues to sell.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, Brian Johnson's a buddy of mine, so I've got to go to a lot of shows.  Brian rolls, man.  Oh, he is so funny. 
[02:56:30]  I can't understand a word he says.  He's happy all the time.  Right, yeah.  I took my son to Amsterdam to see ACDC.  Oh, that must make sense.  Yeah, 91,000 people indoors.  It's a huge stock at soccer stadium, and it was just great.  He's just a great dude.  His wife is just wonderful.  His wife's mother is wonderful.  So we go catch up with him whenever we can.  91,000 people.  ACDC does fucking gigs. 
[02:57:00]  91,000 people.  That's, like, typical for them.  Brian comes across as just a regular dude, man.  Yeah.  Just a regular guy.  Comes in a T-shirt with a hat.  He does not at all act the party.  He's just a nice guy.  Do you guys party?  Him and...  You know, I'm not going to...  Oh, we know.  He parties.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  Well, you know I do, so...  And we're friends.  Yeah.  So let's add it up.  What do you think we have?  Yeah, I didn't want to get that deep.  We got two guys getting fucked up together.  I can only imagine.  It's a good party.  Did you partake in Amsterdam at all?  I've never... 
[02:57:30]  No, no.  I...  Every once in a while, I'll just Christian it up for a little while, and Amsterdam just  turns me off.  No, yeah, no.  I partied like a buffoon.  Does it slow you down at all, the partying?  No.  No, that's the beauty of being a comedian, is that you genuinely have time to recover.  Right.  Because you're not waking up and going to more.  You know, you've got 23 hours to kill before you do anything else, you know?  Mm-hmm.  And when I get...  When I'm on the tour bus, you know, it travels at night, and I'm asleep, and so I wake up the 
[02:58:00]  next morning at a golf course, usually, and go play golf.  Really?  What's your handicap?  Uh, 14.  14, nice.  Is that good or bad?  That's a nice number.  It means every time I play golf, I miss 14 par putts.  It means he's...  And make four.  It means he's probably at 10.  Right, well, I'm sandbagging for some shit I got coming up.  Oh, okay.  People lie about their handicap?  Oh, yeah.  A 14...  All the time.  You don't want to play a 14.  Those guys know how to make money on the golf course.  A 14 is a good number, man. 
[02:58:30]  That means he's probably at 10 or 11.  Oh, okay.  He's squeezing a few shots.  I think the 14's pretty honest.  Okay.  How is Larry?  Maybe I should say it on this platform.  Larry's a horrible golfer.  Okay, I'd hope so.  That would bother me if he was good.  He's better than he used to be, but...  And it doesn't matter where you're playing.  It's sleeveless, flannel shirt, camo shorts, and they let him play.  And it doesn't matter where he's eating.  He doesn't change for anything, does he?  No.  He doesn't have any other clothes.  He doesn't.  No, you open up in his closet on his bus, and he's got like 10 shirts with no sleeves and camo shorts, and that's it. 
[02:59:00]  That's all he has.  Do you guys think that being the blue-collar guys, like, there's a real elitism in comedy where, like, a lot of guys attacked Larry, these fucking cornball comics that would bash him, and it would just drive me nuts.  Did you notice any of that type of horseshit?  Yeah, well, you know, I did.  And, you know, and if he hadn't made a lot of money, nobody would have said anything, you know.  But, you know, people are just, I don't know, shitty, you know, just jealous. 
[02:59:30]  I'm happy when my friends make it, you know, and, you know, I'd cheer anybody's success, you know, because they did something to get there, and they're being recognized for it.  And I tell you what, Dan is one of the quickest guys I know offstage.  Do you know him very well?  I don't know him well, but I know him fairly well.  Yeah, just really, really funny and just a good guy, you know.  And now, is his act my exact cup of tea? 
[03:00:00]  No, no, no, exactly no.  But that's not important.  It doesn't have to be.  But I know he's a funny guy, and, you know, he's a good guy to hang out with.  So I don't know why you would waste your time, you know, criticizing.  You're not a critic, you know.  You're a comedian.  You better go be a fucking comedian because you're wasting time here.  I want to back way up.  You said something earlier that I kind of wrote down.  But you're from a town of 700 people with dirt roads?  So how the fuck do you get out of there and become Ron White? 
[03:00:30]  My father worked for an oil company up there, and they got transferred to Houston when I was about seven or so.  And Houston's a great comedy market.  Well, I wasn't actually in Houston.  I was in Deer Park, which is just dead in the middle of the refineries and the funk in Houston.  And I didn't start stand-up until I was 29.  I started in Dallas.  Oh, yeah.  What did Vic say you did?  Vic was telling us your whole bio.  Yeah, how you guys met.  Vic loves Ron White.  Yeah.  Well, the feeling is mutual.  I love Ron White, too.  No, he said he met you the day that you quit your job. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, right.  I was selling windows and doors, and I was driving around in this little Nissan pickup truck,  and I had sample windows in the back.  And I'd been doing open mic for, you know, I guess about two years or two and a half years.  But I did a lot of it because we had four clubs in Dallas and Fort Worth combined, and I was smart.  I learned how to be a good host.  And I always memorized my announcements.  I always did a slick job.  And then, you know, my comedy was okay. 
[03:01:30]  But I was a good host, so I got to work, you know.  And so I worked every week doing eight or nine shows a week, you know.  And that's what you need as a comic.  You've got to have stage time.  And hosting makes you stronger because you're going up to a dead crowd, totally cold.  It's like everybody likes to middle.  Right.  But going on as a host, and then when the middle is...  You're swinging the bat with the weight on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It makes you better.  Yeah.  And I still do it today, you know.  I'll host open mic night every once in a while just because I do hosting stuff.  And so it's just good, you know, good to throw yourself in an environment you're not really comfortable with. 
[03:02:00]  Do you do corporate stuff?  You say you don't do a lot of corporate stuff or...  No.  Is it because you curse?  Yeah, yeah.  And I don't have another show.  I mean, I don't have a corporate show.  And it would probably beheve me to do it.  But right now, you know, I don't need it.  And every once in a while, somebody will pay me an ass load of money to come do a show for them.  And I'm always surprised.  And then they're always surprised that the show is so blue.  And I'm like, well, we told you.  No kidding, man. 
[03:02:30]  You've got to listen to a record.  Plug it in.  That's what I do.  How about you do a little research before you hire me?  Do what you can, man.  Has it gotten ugly when you do corporate?  Because I was offered recently, a guy came to me for corporate work.  And he said, I can pay you this.  And it was an astronomical amount of money.  And he goes, can you work clean?  And I go, he goes for like 45 minutes to an hour.  And I said, no, because I can't.  I can work without profanity.  But understand corporate.  But the subject matter is still going to be offensive to.  Yes.  And then I had the money. 
[03:03:00]  It almost made me.  Well, what is that about, though?  Corporate people want to hear some edge, don't they?  But you see the problem, like Ron, the principal had.  Right.  That's the way every company is.  And nobody wants to book a comic and get fired because he said something about black people or about Jews or about gays.  Right.  Like they defend somebody in the company and they come after the guy who hired the comic.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  So that makes it tough.  Yeah.  It does.  And if they don't do the research.  When they say, hey, get crazy.  This group is great.  They don't understand comedian crazy.  They mean 5% crazy.  Yeah.  Get 5% crazy.  They mean say shit once 20 minutes in, not do beheading jokes to open. 
[03:03:30]  True.  I did one for this guy that was a German.  He owned a big steel company.  And he was a fan.  He lived in Denver.  And what happens is people are just not comfortable laughing at this stuff with the bright lights, dinner.  You're nowhere near them.  And this is a horrible setup.  But this guy loved me.  He was just out there just guffawed at everything.  And he got drunk as he could be.  He was a big old huge strong guy.  He comes up and hugs me afterwards. 
[03:04:00]  And he and I were drinking McAllen.  And he's throwing them back.  He's throwing this back.  Whoa.  Whatever.  You know, he paid me too much money.  And then we're going down the escalator.  There's a bunch of us.  And this guy starts falling.  He's 6'4".  270 maybe.  And a huge guy.  And he starts falling.  And he takes down seven or eight people with him.  But never spills his drink.  And then he gets up and throws the glass over the edge of the escalator. 
[03:04:30]  It busts on the floor downstairs.  I'm like, well, this guy's a mess.  That type of corporate work is okay.  Yeah, that was fine.  Yeah, of course.  That works.  And this is amazing too as a stand-up.  Fucking, you've gone platinum ten times as a comedy.  He said, nominated for Grammy twice and CD DVD sales have gone platinum ten times.  Wow.  That is fucking...  How many?  That's a lot.  That's just a lot.  That's a lot.  It's a big pile.  Yeah, it really is, man. 
[03:05:00]  Are you the most successful of the guy or is Larry is?  Larry is.  Is he still doing 10,000-seat gigs?  Uh-uh.  No.  No, but, you know, I think he's down to, you know, still really respectable numbers, you  know, like 3,800 or so.  But every once in a while, a real big one.  Isn't that a relief to knock that number down?  Because like you were saying, it's kind of a nightmare.  Oh, yeah, because we were all playing hockey rinks and, you know, bad acoustic buildings.  I'm sure you loved the experience and liked it, but it wasn't the worst thing when you 
[03:05:30]  knocked it down a few thousand.  Right, no.  Yeah, so I'm, and my average show is only like 2,100.  So, well, I mean, I feel like I'm bragging saying 5,800, but I don't do that number anymore.  And now I'm, I live on the top 50 tours in the country, usually, and so I don't, you  know, I don't need it bigger, and I'm perfectly content with where it is.  Would you guys go out again?  I'm sorry, would you guys go out again together, or any couple of you? 
[03:06:00]  I don't, you know, I think we'd probably get together for charity, but I can't see it.  In fact, they just quit doing their tour again, so Jeff kind of backed out.  So, and I haven't talked to him, but yeah, Foxworthy.  Who was on that tour?  It was Engvall, who I, Foxworthy I've never met, Larry I know, and Engvall I've only met  one time.  Who else was with them?  They had a, they replaced me with, oh God, I can't remember the kid's name. 
[03:06:30]  He used to open for me, because he gets a lot of laughs, but no punchlines, and that's  a perfect opening act, you know.  Here's a punchline.  Wow!  Reno Collier.  No, I don't.  Nah, he's a, but anyway, they didn't, you know, it was their show, and he opened it,  you know, they didn't say he was one of the blue, because they didn't call it Blue Collar  Comedy Tour, and they could have, and didn't, so they called it something else, so, you know, 
[03:07:00]  that was fine.  Who is your cup of tea as a comic, like, growing up or whatever, when you're starting, I mean,  if it's not like a cleaner, who did you like growing up?  You know, everybody that sold albums, you know, because I bought them all.  But who's your, like, top five?  We always talk about Carlin, and, you know, Hicks, and Cosby in there, I'm a huge Hicks  fan.  Yeah, Hicks is the biggest influence on me, for sure, is Bill, and, but I had everybody's 
[03:07:30]  albums, and, I mean, and Steve Martin, I loved Steve Martin back in the day, that was  such an original take on comedy, it was so original, it was almost a parody of a comedian,  and then, and he dropped out, he was doing 45,000 people a night, and quit, because...  Well, was he really doing them that big?  Oh, fuck, yeah.  45,000?  45,000, he was the biggest, he's the biggest comic that ever lived.  That's outdoor shit.  Yeah, it's outdoor shit, baseball thing, I mean, I think his biggest shows were around 
[03:08:00]  100,000, 80,000.  Why doesn't anyone talk about how huge he was, because I guess it's been so long.  Yeah, 25,000 a night, my God.  He's known as a movie star, too, like now, it's mostly his movie, I didn't realize he  was doing them that big, I thought he was doing 10,000 to 15,000.  Oh, yeah, because he was coming off Saturday Night Live, when he was doing those bits with  Ackroyd, and on TV all the time, and, yeah, so it got huge, and he, and...  What happened to him, you think he just got burnt out, as far as that goes? 
[03:08:30]  He considered himself a parody, and he didn't think he could reinvent it, and make it  interesting, so he just walked away from it, and went and did The Jerk, and...  I like that movie.  Yeah, it was a great film, great film.  I really like that one.  He wrote it, and so, I mean, he lives in Montecito, where I live, in North L.A., and I've never  met him, but I'd love to, you know, he's a tremendous talent, but I, but also, you know,  everybody else, Pryor, and Carlin, and everybody. 
[03:09:00]  You'll listen to Woody Allen's stuff from the 60s, his stand-up from the 60s, he was  a great stand-up, it's one of those, but he hated doing, like, when you watch videos  of him, he's holding the mic stand, he's all fucking...  So uncomfortable.  Yeah, I think he said he used to puke before he'd go on, like, he genuinely hated doing  stand-ups.  Would you imagine going to see him?  Yeah, he was a great one.  That would be kind of cool.  Right, now, we had this, well, it was called, what it was, was football, and it was an Andy  Griffith album, when I was a little kid, and that somebody had given my father, and I used  to play it all the time, and I know I didn't get the jokes exactly, real country stuff, 
[03:09:30]  but I remember, I really liked to listen to people laugh, you know, because it was a  good recording for the day, and we had some New Heart also.  Oh, right, right, right.  Bob New Heart's great.  Didn't they have the number one and two comedy, like, number one records in the country?  Yeah.  Fucking.  He put out two, and they went one and two.  And he was brand new when he did that first record, like, he was not an experienced stand-up,  like, he had done it a few times, like, he was literally, I think, a brand new comic. 
[03:10:00]  Love his delivery.  And he just recorded, like, this amazing comedy record.  Right.  You know, it's kind of depressing, also makes you want to fucking blow your brains out.  Well, not me, but you, I can see.  Me, yeah, absolutely.  I can see where that has some kind of effect on you, eventually.  Yeah, wouldn't bother Ron, who's in the fucking tour bus, although not quite Larry's bus,  but...  Oh, I know, we learned that Larry's bus is even better.  I want to see a king-size bed on a bus.  I want to see that.  Yeah, you know, he may have one on his, because he's got those two slide-outs in the back. 
[03:10:30]  So, I don't remember.  You don't?  I have one slide-out in the front.  That's it.  And you have a king-size bed, or no?  No, queen.  Oh, queen, okay.  And how is it shitting on the bus?  Are you fine doing that?  I'm fine, as long as nobody shits on the bus but me.  Is the shower okay?  Steve told everyone.  Yeah, the shower's okay if you're stopped, but if you're moving around, it's, you know,  it's not that great.  But you've done it.  Oh, yeah, I have.  But Larry's shower.  Yeah, Larry's shower.  It's on the roof.  When the bus is moving, you can still shower. 
[03:11:00]  He's got a hot tub.  Do you really, do you love the road?  You know, I miss it when I don't do it, but these days, I haven't missed it as much when  I've taken time off.  I mean, I start tapping my toes, you know, I get antsy to stay at home, because I've done  this for 26 years.  It's what you know.  Yeah, so, but lately, it's been harder to, you know, okay, I gotta, because I gotta keep  my chops, so, which is why I do so many shows, and I gotta, you know, if you wanna see what 
[03:11:30]  happens to a comic when they sit on their ass for a couple years and then go do a special,  look at Dennis Miller's last special, which was just awful.  Was it bad?  When did he do it?  Oh, he's reading it off a teleprompter.  Oh, my God.  And I, now you gotta go see that.  I was, I was watching it.  It's pretty old, but, I mean.  Yeah, I'm gonna check it out anyway.  Yeah, I literally, I was watching it, and I'm like, oh, fuck, I need to go do a set.  I got up and went down to the punchline, and I go, hey, can I get on and. 
[03:12:00]  Do a little time.  Do a little time.  You gotta go on and just work out material.  How often do you flip, like, would you just do the, once you shoot an hour, will you  kind of.  I try to ride it out of my show.  Yeah, you get sick of doing it, and it's like, it gets very boring.  I don't know how guys say the same thing for 10 years.  Is it hard to say goodbye to some of that material, though?  It's a goddamn nightmare to say goodbye to some of it, but if you don't, they're gonna  quit coming to see you, you know.  Right.  They'll come see it twice, and then I also get a lot of complaints, because I don't do  any of it, and off the, anything off the first three albums, nothing.  And I saw Steve Martin one time in a theater that I play in San Diego, when I was in A 
[03:12:30]  school in the Navy, and he didn't do anything off of Let's Get Small, and I walked away  kind of pissed, and now I don't do it either.  But I get it.  You gotta move on.  You gotta go.  It's not a hit song.  It's nothing like a hit song.  And if you know the joke, you know the joke.  That's it.  It's not gonna catch you off guard.  It's not gonna catch you off guard.  Right.  Yeah, and I'm not gonna get the reaction.  What they'll do is they want me to do the Tater Salad story, which is eight minutes long,  and if I say, I got thrown out of a bar in New York City, they will go crazy, and then 
[03:13:00]  I gotta drag them through an eight-minute-long bit.  They know.  So instead of laughing, they applaud, which I hate.  I want your reaction to be laughter, that you can't just a knee-jerk reaction.  So I don't need, you know, I'm not, you know, once it starts getting the pop, I know it's  done, and then, you know, just take it out.  It's like Dice with the nursery rhymes, where he got in a way where they would just cheer  for the rhymes, or they would yell the rhymes, but there wasn't that same effect that they 
[03:13:30]  had, I'm sure, like when he did the Dangerfield special, of just the fucking raw laughs.  Right, right, right.  You do more movies?  You're in Horrible Bosses.  I love that movie.  Yeah, I did one that we shot last summer, and Billy Bob Thornton wrote it and directed  it, and I met him at a bar in Austin, and the next day was gonna be Ron White Day in  the state of Texas, and we stayed up drinking on his bus all night long, and I was supposed  to be at the House, address the House of Representatives at 7.30 or so the next morning, and he wrote 
[03:14:00]  me a note that's an excuse note, and then he signed Canada's favorite son, Billy Bob Thornton,  and that day, he told me, he said, hey man, I got a script, I got a part for you in it,  and I'm not finished with it yet, and he goes, you got the part, and I said, oh yeah.  And any time you hear something like that in Hollywood, it's a fucking lie, you know, it  never comes back.  A year later, he calls me, and he goes, hey man, I got it, it's ready, you want to read  it?  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, sure, I'd love to read it. 
[03:14:30]  And he goes, now, you'll love the role, which is a great role.  I play a two-time pro bowler that owns six car dealerships in the greater Atlanta area  and can't quit talking about himself, and he said, it's not going to pay a lot of money.  Dude, I'll mow your lawn for a fucking year.  I didn't mean me personally, but I'll get my agent to do it.  So it's a good movie, and I don't know when it's coming out, because I'm just not in the  loop.  My wife and I went to Berlin in January to see the world premiere at the Berlin Film 
[03:15:00]  Festival, and we took our mothers, and I don't recommend this, because our mothers, they're  really good friends, and they're little bitty, they're both around five feet tall, and they  hold hands everywhere they go.  So we were there for 10 days, and it was just freezing cold, so we had 10 days of, I don't  think I have one of my gloves.  I'm like, I know, let's go get you another pair of gloves then, Mama, they sell them all 
[03:15:30]  over this town.  Well, find your gloves.  Well, I really like those gloves, and well, they're gone now, Mama.  Let's move on.  Just like those bits.  Right.  One more thing, because we're just getting to know Ron White.  I hope you come back and see us.  Arrested, 2008, marijuana possession?  I just saw this on the sheet.  Yeah.  If you don't want to talk about it.  Oh, no, I don't care.  I don't care.  But they found, what, pot on your private plane?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened was, I fired these two pilots for being just incompetent dickheads, and 
[03:16:00]  they were such dickheads, they started following my plane around on a software called FlightAware.  If you know the tail number, you can follow any plane in the world, anywhere it goes.  And then, before I'd land in town, they'd call the cops and tell them it's a drug plane.  So, the cops come out with, you know, guns and dogs and SWAT teams, and that's pretty  fucking funny.  And one time, it worked.  He goes, what'd you tell a doctor to get a prescription for marijuana?  I said, well, the doctor asked me if I had any symptoms, and I said, I get bummed when  I run out of weed.  Stamp.  Marijuana cures that. 
[03:16:30]  All right, Ron White.  This was a pleasure, man.  Yes.  Hey, thanks.  You guys have a great show.  Finally get to be Ron White.  How cool is that?  What's that?  More unforgettable appearances from the biggest names in comedy coming up.  This big world, this big round globe, is theater in the round to me.  I'm just here for the show.  A very chippers in Thanksgiving will continue on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Now, more legendary O&A appearances from our favorite stand-up comics.  A very chippers in Thanksgiving continues. 
[03:17:00]  This is segment six.  Fucking Dane Cook and fucking Bill Burr and fucking Bob Kelly.  All these fucking guys from Boston.  Fucking Bob Kelly's a fucking cocksucker.  Yeah, you know what, dude?  Fuck you, cocksucker.  This was one of the rare occasions where Dane come in the studio.  He's usually too hoity-toity.  He's on the fucking phone or something.  And Bill Burr, what is he, cold or something?  That's what I always call him.  I go, hey, it's Bill Burr. 
[03:17:30]  Burr.  And I fucking stand there and shake for like five minutes.  Everybody cracks up.  And fucking Bob Kelly.  They're all in studio.  And they talk about how they came up in comedy together.  I don't give a fuck.  Who cares?  Hey, remember that time that I told that joke?  Fuck you, cocksucker.  This is the worst coffee and the mysterious XM.  Dane, what's up, brother?  Look who's got to take the fucking couch.  Oh, Bobby.  What?  What's wrong with the fuck?  Bobby's got to take the couch. 
[03:18:00]  It's the first time he's ever been asked to sit on the couch.  I saw him.  That was just hurtful and mean.  I'm kidding, Bob.  Settle down.  I was just talking to him about the Propecia and the Rogaine.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think I want hair again.  I think I might go the way.  I'm getting a great mullet growing back here.  I've got a video.  I've got to get rid of it.  Can I have some of your mullet?  Yeah, I'll get it from the donor area. 
[03:18:30]  What's your video?  I took the Propecia and I started cumming yellow chunks.  What?  For real?  I'm not even kidding.  Honest to God.  I'm supposed to put it on your head.  Bob is dipping his cock in Propecia.  I'm really hairy balls.  I'm killing his dick holes.  What the fuck are you doing?  You know what?  You're bald.  You put the hair back on.  Boom.  You got hair again.  A cup of coffee.  Cigarette.  Yeah.  You can call me wearing hats.  Dane said he's got a video.  What's the video?  Somebody said Jay Hall's brother from Chicago had our first. 
[03:19:00]  It was 92.  And it's all of us doing our stand-up and then sketches.  It's the whole show.  Wow.  Yeah, we did improv, which is one letter short of improve.  No, no, no.  Here's our improv.  Here's our improv.  We're so savvy.  We're on stage and we're like, all right, we need a fake movie.  You know, improv is like the first thing somebody yells out.  We're sifting through all the options.  Guys are like, ghost house, and we're looking at each other.  Nah, what else? 
[03:19:30]  Keep yelling.  Keep yelling.  If you yell something we've done before.  It's fucking improv.  You're supposed to just go with the first one.  No.  Nah.  Improv stinks.  I just hate it.  You know, my girl's taking an improv club.  I went to class and she actually gave me the book on, like, you know, how to do improv and  everything.  And the amount of swipes they take at stand-up comedians.  Oh, you shitting me really?  I was reading it on the plane.  I just kept going like, yeah, they're just like, you know, this isn't like a stand-up comedian  where it's all been rehearsed time and time again. 
[03:20:00]  Sure, there might be a little bit of improv.  It's just like...  Yeah, it's great when you go, okay, and freeze.  But if I wrote a book on stand-up, at no point would I feel the need to take a swipe at people  who do improv.  Because they're fucking jealous that they...  I'm telling you, improv people are fucking jealous that they can't just stand in with  a microphone.  They need eight other people.  And when they run out of fucking steam, they yell, tag, and the next asshole comes and  bails them out.  We don't have that option.  You think I don't want to yell, tag, sometimes?  I'm fucking eating my balls?  Please come up and help me. 
[03:20:30]  Now, wasn't that improv right there?  Did you have all that written?  I said that actually yesterday morning, exact same time.  Every morning, same thing.  I tried it on 800 different radio stations before I came...  That's what I was thinking.  I was thinking, Yopi and Anthony show you improv every day.  Oh my god, we don't know what the fuck we're going to say next.  We're reading a teleprompter right now.  Right, yeah.  The whole rule of improv, too, like number one golden rule.  Don't deny.  Don't deny.  And our whole thing was deny.  We would just mess with each other.  You'd be like, oh, obviously holding a fake baby rocket. 
[03:21:00]  Why are you carrying your own tire from your car?  It would just destroy each other with the night.  That's great.  Like comedy cock block.  You guys aren't all the biggest assholes out there.  Comics are just assholes.  Don't let anything go.  Sometimes the problems will be false.  I just found that fucking... 
[03:21:30]  This just sucks.  I ordered an egg white almond with ham, and there was a carrot in the middle of it.  Why egg whites with ham?  Fuck, why is there orange?  Like, why bother with the ham?  If you're going to have the ham, you might as well just go all in with the eggs.  Go with the yolk.  The yolk is the best tasting part.  I like egg white.  And douse it in salt and pepper.  The only time I like the yolk is when it's gooey.  Yeah, you could have it like loose.  When you bite it in a sandwich, it just shoots out, then you wipe it up with a fucking...  Some toast.  Yeah.  Good shit right there, man.  Don't get me going on fat stories. 
[03:22:00]  Don't get me going.  But I actually was in Miami Improv.  I went to El Polo Tropical and ordered $40 worth of meat.  The next year I went back, they remembered me.  They were like, oh, you last time here.  What are the most meat ever?  Remember we had like that session at Fogo?  A session?  We sat there so long that the knives were dull by the time the check came.  How about the other night?  We were working out for like two weeks straight, eating egg whites and chicken breasts. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  And then I brought up McDonald's for some reason.  Oh, no.  How I hate getting fries, one fry, large fry, because it ends.  You know, you get to the end, and you're like, ah, that's that one mushy fry at the end  that you're trying to...  Should I dip it in ketchup?  Should I eat it raw?  How should I enjoy...  You eat a large fry, and you're upset that it ends?  Dude, fat people make food so fucking gross.  He goes...  They just make it gross.  So he tells me, he goes, well, do what I used to do.  I used to get three large fries, put them in a bag. 
[03:23:00]  That way, I'm not going to eat them all, but they never end.  Oh, holy shit, it's never ending.  That's a great way to go about it.  I thought it was fantastic.  We're talking about it.  Then we decide we're going to do it one day.  You just eat it until you sleep.  We decide we're going to do it one day, and then it turns into either tomorrow night  or the next night.  And then we're driving by McDonald's after the gig, and we're like, dude, there's a McDonald's.  And we're going back and forth.  All of a sudden, this stupid limo driver just turns in.  Turned in.  He made the decision for you.  We weren't going to say yes.  So for the whole time, we're like, yeah, dude, there it is. 
[03:23:30]  There it is.  And this guy just gets in the drive-thru.  We just froze and stared at each other.  And he did that thing where he pulled up so the mic was next to the back, you know, the  back window.  So we had the entire option to be like, no, we're good.  Dude, two double quarter pounders with cheese, a shake, ten chicken McNuggets, three fries  each.  Each.  Each.  Yeah, they had to drop new fries for us.  Then we got on the plane. 
[03:24:00]  We had Tyson documentary, and then we ate all the food.  I thought it was fucking hallucinating.  Yeah.  Because we saw the northern lights.  We're coming from Alaska.  So I look out the window, and it's just green and purple.  I'm like, I'm dying.  I caught diabetes.  He's got, like, so full of trans fats, he can't recognize colors anymore.  That's fucked up.  You know what's funny, though, is you sit there and you say you're not going to eat it, but  the second you get a whiff of that grease, it's over.  It's fucking over, it really is. 
[03:24:30]  It's one of the great smells that's on this planet.  You guys like the Tyson documentary?  How great was that?  To see Tyson have a fucking brain.  Yeah, man.  He's really, he's like Mensa smart, man.  That guy was.  Absolutely.  No one knew that.  So intelligent.  Anyone who watched Anvil?  Have you seen that documentary?  I love Anvil.  I've had Anvil in here.  They're the fucking great.  It's good to know that they're doing okay.  Yeah, but now I heard they're going to do the soundtrack for, like, Iron Man 2.  Yeah.  Now they're as big as you can get.  That's incredible.  But they made it because they didn't make it. 
[03:25:00]  Like, it's a fucking paradox.  They made it because they hadn't made it for so long.  Yeah, that's what I'm hoping for.  And that's the only way they made it.  I'm hoping to make a documentary next year.  Have you seen it in?  No, I haven't seen it.  No, you've seen it?  No, I didn't see it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  You feel so bad for the one guy because he's just believing in the dream that he should  have gave up on 20 years ago.  He's got the lip quiver.  Yeah.  Okay.  We're going to do this.  We have to all agree that it will. 
[03:25:30]  He was just freezing in the meat locker where he works.  And then they go to the...  What do you have to do?  You have to deliver meals?  You have to deliver meals to the elderly or something in the middle of winter?  But this is the worst part.  The bass player who's the shit out in any band, he was his boss at the fucking vegetable  factory or wherever the fuck he worked.  So he's the one who makes all the vegetables and puts them in the tins.  This asshole has to go get it from the bass player.  And he's got an attitude and shit.  Like he has a chef's jacket on and he's fucking mixing vegetables for homeless people. 
[03:26:00]  You know, everybody who works at the restaurant makes fun of them.  Why are they still the long hair?  Dude, they're in a band.  He walks by, they're like, metal on metal.  I love documentaries.  Talking about forks.  This is one of the best documentaries, though.  I mean, they're at big, huge festivals in Europe and the guys that they came up with  could give a shit that they're there and they're all excited.  Like, Lars is going to recognize them and stuff.  Oh, wow.  Oh, they just get the cold shoulder from everybody else in the business.  And his own kid.  And whenever your kid is like, you know, they're like, what do you think of your dad's music? 
[03:26:30]  And the kid's like, yeah.  At least to have the kid be like, no, my dad rocks.  That would, like, fill me up.  And instead I ate two more large fries and stared at the northern lights.  And the family doesn't believe in him anymore.  Our sister.  The sister's still giving him money to keep his dream alive because he's very rich, I guess.  Yeah.  He's fighting with club owners over a hundred dollar fucking, you know, a hundred dollars  for a gig or something.  All right, I gotta see this now.  Fucking Germany.  Oh, you're gonna love it. 
[03:27:00]  Did you guys see, uh...  What about the tour manager crying on the, uh, on the train tracks?  Yeah.  But she wasn't even a tour manager, right?  She was just a fan from Europe who wrote them and was like, I believe in you.  Yeah, but she kept fucking everything up.  Taking buses and rickshaws and shit.  That sounds like Spinal Tap.  Totally like, it's shit, gets in charge and fucks things up.  I mean, the train goes and they're still on the platform and she breaks down crying.  And then, I forgot their names, but they're like, what do you mean you didn't buy tickets? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  And now they're just stuck in the middle of Europe with no fucking plan and she's crying.  I have no heart for anybody who goes with the excuse of, I'm trying so hard for you.  How about fucking prepare a year in advance instead of trying to wing my career?  I am doing everything that I can to...  What?  You made one phone call to see if a train was coming.  Can you imagine if Barry Katz doing that to you, Dean?  I can imagine.  I witnessed it for a time.  It's called the first five years of my career. 
[03:28:00]  There's Alex out there.  There's the fucking...  What's up, Alex?  That's the man right there.  Alex is the main guy now?  We call him Tree Face.  Alex.  Yeah?  What's Alex all about?  Yeah, he looks like an old man in a tree.  What the fuck?  Look at him.  Look at him.  Fucking big jaw.  You know what that reminds me of when you talk about that whole, I'm trying?  I was sitting...  One of my pet peeves is when you're sitting in the green room at a club and there's no waitress.  And you're sitting...  There's no water.  There's no food or anything.  So three times I got to ask to get a waitress to come back. 
[03:28:30]  I'm fucking starving it before I do a show.  So finally this waitress comes walking in and she just goes, oh my god, I'm like the  worst waitress ever.  And I go, really?  Well, can you send the good one back here?  It's like, what?  Because you called yourself out for sucking?  Now I'm supposed to accept it?  Oh, now it's funny.  Now it's funny because you said you sucked.  So now I can just enjoy it.  Now you go, oh my god, I'm the worst tipper ever.  So this is a great combination.  She read one of those dumb books about you got to own your own stuff so that nobody can 
[03:29:00]  take your power and fuck with it.  So she came in.  I am the worst ever.  What's my move on the chessboard?  How to suck and still succeed.  Just admit to it before somebody calls you out on it.  There you go.  But you know what?  You take it to another level of like, yeah, your boyfriend must hate you.  Just something weird when she walks away.  What?  Make her leave angry.  Yes, but I'm not a bad girlfriend.  Well, that's just going to spit in your food.  Do you worry about that?  She probably will.  At a comedy club?  Well. 
[03:29:30]  Probably make it taste better.  Fucking shitholes.  Stupid chicken wings.  We were talking about this last night when.  Quesadillas.  Oh, fucking dumb quesadillas and skirt steak.  A fucking poor man's steak.  When you meet somebody and you go, oh, it's really nice too.  I meet you.  And they go, we've actually met before.  They pull that in front of other people.  This girl, oh, hey, yeah.  It's cool.  Nice to meet you.  No, we actually meet.  We met before.  And I'm just staring at her.  Everybody's kind of looking at that awkward moment. 
[03:30:00]  I'm like, oh, yeah.  Yeah, what's up?  What's going on?  You don't remember.  You don't really remember.  I love that one, too, where it's like, hey, how you doing?  You're like, hey, what's up?  You don't remember me, do you?  It's like, why do you got to put me in that fucking position?  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  No, I absolutely don't.  We meet a few people, you know, I might not remember fucking, you know.  I have cousins.  I don't even know their fucking name.  Right.  Exactly.  If people in my family at barbecue is like, who's that little cute girl?  You don't remember?  And they know the time limit you talked?  We talked for like a half hour. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  At a party.  Oh, really?  Or they go, all right, what's my name?  Because sometimes I try to bluff and go, do you remember me?  I go, yeah, hell yeah.  Yeah.  What's my name?  All right, look, I gave you an out to feel good.  Now I'm just going to dive on you.  I have no fucking clue who you are.  I don't care about you.  I'm even bad if I know people.  Sometimes I get like a panic, like, oh, fuck.  So I literally, if I was working with these two guys, I've known these guys for like 17  years.  If I was working with them just as a backup plan, I'm such a moron. 
[03:31:00]  I would, and if I was hosting the show, I would write their names on my hands.  Not these guys, but you know what I mean?  Like guys, you know what I mean?  I would literally have to be writing that.  That was my big panic as a host that I was going to forget the name.  I've had people come up and I'm like, all right, someone's coming.  I know the face.  I don't know the fucking name.  So you turn to whoever you're with and go, all right, I'll say hello.  Immediately introduce yourself.  Yes.  And I'll be like, I'll be like, oh, I'm so rude.  I'm sorry.  And then right when they say the name, you go like, Karen, Karen, this is Karen. 
[03:31:30]  To try to make it seem like you knew it was.  It's a timing thing, though.  It is totally a timing thing.  And then I blame myself.  I'm like, oh, I'm so fucking rude.  I'm sorry.  Yes, of course.  I thought you guys met, but you guys didn't meet before.  Yeah, I thought you did.  I got that worked out with my girlfriend.  That's the deal.  That's me too.  If I don't introduce you.  Immediately.  Yes, don't get mad.  Introduce yourself.  And go, he's rude.  Yes.  And you know what the worst thing is?  The worst thing is when your girl says, you know, hey, I'm Karen.  And then the other guy goes, oh, hey, how's it going?  You're like, fuck, say your name.  What's your name?  Say your name. 
[03:32:00]  Here's your job to get both their names.  I get so paranoid with being the guy that goes out.  What's up, bro?  Because usually, hey, what's up, bro?  What's up, man?  Leads to it.  That used to work.  Then I try to get clever, and I'm like, muchacho.  And I end up calling him some weird.  You're going to chief champ.  You're going everywhere.  What the fuck is your name?  What's up, lips?  I get my nickname.  The fucking bro thing used to work, though.  You could get out of situations.  You're just saying, hey, bro, what's up, man?  Here's the worst one I've had recently.  I went to town to this club, and there was some guy, some chef at a restaurant, right? 
[03:32:30]  He was a big fan.  So, yeah, come on down.  So we go down there, and this guy feeds us like it's the last Thanksgiving ever.  Everything on the menu.  It was, like, bizarre.  Like, we had, like, shrimp, and then waffles came out.  It was unreal, but it was all delicious.  And I hung out and talked to this guy for 45 minutes.  And he goes, yeah, I'm coming out to the late show tonight.  I go, all right, dude, well, hang on.  I'll get you a DVD.  Thank you so much, blah, blah, blah.  So the end of the show, the guy stands in line like a regular person.  So I'm totally in robot mode going, hey, did you have a good time? 
[03:33:00]  All right, thanks a lot.  So the guy who just made me a free meal, I'm talking.  He's like, hey, what's going on?  I'm like, hey, man, did you have a good time?  You want a DVD or something like that?  And the guy's looking at me, and I totally didn't even recognize him.  Did he pay for it?  No, he ended up walking away.  And then the middle act comes up to me, and he goes, oh, did you see Chef Chris?  Chef Chris came out.  I go, oh, fuck.  I had a dick.  No, no, but I went down to his restaurant the next day with DVD in hand.  I was just like, dude, you got to understand, people come up to you, and they say, my brother 
[03:33:30]  just died.  He liked your comedy.  They're just like bizarre shit.  People slapping you on the back.  He's like, yeah, thanks.  Right, go fuck yourself.  There's no excuse.  I was still full from what the guy fucking hooked me into, and I couldn't remember.  I couldn't remember.  What?  And a big gay guy.  Robert Kelly?  No, I said great hair.  Oh, that was back in the day you did?  I did.  You're a model, motherfucker.  You're some nice hair.  I could have been in Menudo.  And he had the fuzziest pink. 
[03:34:00]  It was just this hairy, fuzzy pink sweater.  You're right.  It was so hot.  He just made the wrong choice in wardrobe, and he was sweating the whole time.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That music.  It was always like a Casio keyboard or some really cheesy saxophone.  There's always a bouncer at the front door of the club.  And they do the fake freeze, but they're still kind of moving. 
[03:34:30]  And there's the name.  And then when they show the performer, he's got to do that surprise look like he doesn't  know the camera, like the double take.  Then he runs to the backside entrance, and he enters this.  It's a bad cut to the stage, too.  It's like, oh, I'm running right from the alley, right on the...  Back then, balance is all wrong.  He's gotten a haircut since the opening show.  There was a haircut.  One comic's putting his fucking jacket in a locker, and comics get lockers. 
[03:35:00]  God damn, those were really...  They're on HBO Classic now.  Every so often, they pop on.  And you see these guys that wound up becoming huge, and then these other guys are like,  who's that?  That's like, he just fucking muddled his way through comedy clubs and never made a dent.  Nothing.  Nothing.  That gay guy with the pink sweater was just sweating his whole set.  Do you remember there was a guy on Stand Up Spotlight?  Every time he would do...  When he would finish his act, he would do a backflip. 
[03:35:30]  That's what I got.  And he'd do a backflip, and then do like this big...  That's what you need.  Like he was doing the YMCA.  He'd just do the Y.  He would do that.  And I remember this before I got in comedy, and I was embarrassed.  I actually liked the guy.  I was literally like the moron comedy fan.  Like, this is the guy who does the backflip.  He's the backflip guy.  I totally saw...  I hope he's in a motorized wheelchair now, running it with his mouth, because he fucked  up one night.  I used to do comedy.  I did a backflip.  What's the comic's name that was in the wheelchair where you used to forget him upstairs all the 
[03:36:00]  time at the end of the show?  Oh, yeah.  He had the mustache, the red...  Matt Malley.  Matt Malley.  What?  Is he a Boston guy?  Yeah.  It was like...  There was like fucking three huge flights of stairs to get up to the comedy club, and  there was just a big, huge picture window.  Yeah.  And we'd all...  A great show.  We'd be up front, hanging out, smoking butts.  We'd always look up and just see him steaming up the window, because we forgot him upstairs.  Yeah, but his wheelchair was like the template wheel.  It was like made of concrete.  It was the heaviest thing you ever tried to...  An alloy that was like found on Mars. 
[03:36:30]  It was six of us.  It was like the Flintstone wheelchair.  You're like wheels made out of stone.  Everybody used to be...  He had a teak backboard on him.  Jesus Christ.  We used to have to lift him.  Dude, that guy one time, he booked me at a...  He told me it was a high school.  He goes, I got a gig.  It's a high school.  Me and remember Jim Dunn?  Yeah.  He goes, me, Jim Dunn, and Matt Malley books us at this high school, right?  And we're sitting there going like, oh my God, this is going to be brutal. 
[03:37:00]  It's a high school.  What the fuck am I going to talk about?  What am I going to talk about?  Dude, we show up.  It's a junior high.  Holy shit.  We're standing backstage.  The kids are so young, their voices haven't even changed yet.  So it's just to see it.  They go like, oh my God, we're going to die.  I hope he does a backflip.  Yeah.  Is this backflip guy?  So the principal shows up, who actually looks like an ex-marine, like a janitor.  He goes, all right, I'm doing the intros.  What do you got me to say?  So he tells me intros.  And he comes walking out.  And the kids are like, hey.  This is the intro. 
[03:37:30]  He goes, and we are quiet, please.  And everybody just shuts up.  And he starts berating them, saying if anybody says, you know, yells out anything, they're  getting detention and all that.  So I think, and we were so, how did it go?  I forget the lineup.  But all I remember was, I think me and Jim went on first, and then Matt was closing it  out.  And he was eating his balls, his numb nuts, just sitting there.  And we sat back there and enjoyed it.  We were so fucking mad at him. 
[03:38:00]  We were so mad at him for booking it.  We just sat.  It was the best part.  It was worth eating my balls out in front of him.  He was nervously rolling back and forth.  He booked me and Aldo Benny at the White Stallion.  It was just like a bikey bar way up in New Hampshire.  And we're hanging out.  It's just a hell gig.  It's just terrible.  And the owner comes out to start the show.  And he's shit-faced.  He grabs the mic.  He goes, all right, we start the show.  It was like four people, drunk fucking MILF. 
[03:38:30]  And he goes, all right, we're going to bring up the first guy.  He's in a wheelchair.  Get this.  This is how it happened.  He was emptying a fish tank out the window, and it pulled him out.  And he fell on his neck and snapped his neck, and he paralyzed himself.  He goes, hey, Matt, why didn't you just fucking let go of the fish tank, stupid?  Matt Malley, everybody.  And then he wheels up.  That might be the best intro I've ever heard.  That's fucking bad. 
[03:39:00]  I'm not going to say the comic's name, just out of being nice, but there was a comic who  used to have a lazy eye, and he was unbelievably sensitive about it.  Unbelievably sensitive.  So I'm bombing this hell gig.  It's a two-story bar, and we're upstairs, and they have screen windows.  There's like a carnival across the street.  It was just fucking horrific.  So the dude goes up to host the show.  He's all excited, because he finally has a room to do with a lazy eye.  And then literally, he gets like, hey, how's everybody doing?  And the guys from Time to Kill are literally sitting in the front row, and the guy just 
[03:39:30]  looks right at him, and he goes, dude, the fuck is wrong with your eyes?  Right?  He had nothing.  He was just standing there going, just going, I can't believe you said that.  You think he'd have something to do.  You think he would have worked on his lazy eye material.  And then he's trying to get pity from all these other people playing like pinball,  they don't even give a shit.  Can you believe someone would say something like that?  Why would you be so mean?  I know what you're talking about.  That one comeback for that.  It wasn't even, it wasn't even, who?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:40:00]  Remember the guy, who was the guy that had this, who would bleed?  What?  Because he had that skin disease, and he would just bleed?  How do I forget that guy?  The guy, remember, he was just red all the time.  He was always red, and then he would, he would bleed.  He'd have to have a napkin, because his lips would chap up so bad, and his face would chap  up, he would just start bleeding.  And then you'd go to eat with him after.  I used to have to tell him, go sit on the table, because you're bleeding.  I can't watch you dab blood onto a fucking tissue.  It was like his whole body was chapped lips. 
[03:40:30]  And if he would go to...  He was shiny, because he always had to grease, he had to dip his head in grease before he  went out.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I remember that guy.  Holy shit.  You remember that guy?  I don't know.  Was he funny, at least?  No.  No.  Scaly.  What the fuck did he have, man?  Dude, I don't know, but he was shiny all the time, because he had to always condition  his face, and he would bleed.  Like, on stage, he'd have a napkin, dab, because when he'd tell a joke, his lip would  crack sometimes, and just start bleeding. 
[03:41:00]  And just start bleeding?  Oh.  That's horrible.  Oh, it's awful.  What kind of affliction is that there's no God.  You just took the front of the room with that story.  There's no God.  Jesus.  Where do we go with that one?  It makes you bleed.  It's almost maybe a gag.  I'm getting crazy signs.  We've got to get Dean out of here.  He's got stuff to do.  Okay.  Okay.  Are you sticking around, though, Bobby?  How'd you burn, by the way, Bobby?  Yeah, it's good.  What happened?  You all right?  Oh, this cock's fucking...  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  Hey.  You know, we're...  Hey.  You know, we're...  Now it's six minutes.  You fuck around. 
[03:41:30]  Easy.  Easy.  Yeah, I'll fuck it.  You just called me a cock blank.  You burned me.  You just called me a cock blank.  That's hilarious.  Now I'm going to do 28.  All right, Bobby.  Just bring people up.  I'm lighting on your intro.  Oh, fuck you, both of you.  That's kind of funny.  That's kind of funny.  I'm going to bump into your time, and I'm going to do the whole show.  Just annoy everybody.  Every little girl's going to go, what the fuck?  I, uh...  You know, we fuck around backstage all the time.  We throw shit at each other and fucking whip each other with coat hangers and just punch 
[03:42:00]  each other in the face.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  This fucking dummy grabs a...  What was it?  What did you do first?  Let's start with the...  I hit him in the nuts.  Yeah.  With a Fuji bottle.  Which immediately takes you to DEF CON, you know, I'm doing anything I can to get back  you.  I have to go on stage in 10 minutes.  You just hit me with your...  You know, in the nuts.  I got to go on stage in fucking 13 seconds, and you burnt me with a fucking flat iron.  That is true.  What?  He pinched my elbow with a flat iron.  Jesus Christ.  This is his theory. 
[03:42:30]  He goes, dude, I didn't know it was that hot.  I put it on my head all the time.  I go, dude, it's a fucking...  The word iron is in it.  It's fucking...  Dude, he's got the John Bender, do I stutter, burn.  Holy shit.  This is what you get...  What's wrong with you?  It looked like an arrowhead for like a week.  ...and spilled paint in the garage.  Do I stutter?  Oh, you're getting one tonight.  Smoke him up, Johnny!  Yeah.  I know Dane's had a tough year, but now he's fucking taking it on his fucking friends.  Oh, I was... 
[03:43:00]  You know when somebody burned you and you...  Holy shit!  He's testing your loyalty.  Some accidental shit happens and you get fucking angry and you're...  He hit me in the balls open.  Yeah, dude, you fucking burned me.  Yeah, but you could still be a father after that one.  No, it sounds like you hit him in the balls first.  He did.  He did.  He did.  No, no.  I was second.  He actually...  Sir, he did.  He did.  Who's sir?  You started it.  Me.  I'm sir today.  Sir Missy changes the whole mood.  I'm the judge.  It became testimony.  I'm the judge.  I'm the jury right here.  All right, here we go.  I was trying to get the tattoo so I could ruin it. 
[03:43:30]  You don't like that tattoo either, do you?  No, no.  We hate it.  Are you really going to go on?  We just haven't told him to his face yet.  Are you done?  Yes, Bobby.  Go ahead.  Match that.  Shut your face.  Is it a dragon, Bob?  Yeah.  It's a koi.  No, no, no.  It's a dragon.  Where's the koi?  Is it a fish?  That one's over here.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Can you get a picture of you, a tattoo of you like fly fishing?  I just remembered I hate two of your...  On your other shoulder with like the big rubber pants.  Look, we got to get David out of their pacing.  What's that?  Tell your story.  Get a tattoo of you like fly fishing on your arm.  Be a cool one, man.  Yeah.  Big rubber pants. 
[03:44:00]  Be like an action one where you can tell like the thing's moving and you just, you've  found your piece.  If I flex my muscles, the fucking...  He does have a good whip.  Okay.  But I burnt you once.  Oh, yeah.  But how many times do I give you a big hug and I say, Bobby, I want you to be your best  tonight and I really want to see you succeed.  Go out and make these people laugh.  How many times do I embrace you at that?  What are you, Bon Jovi?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Oh, that's so nice.  How many times do I tell you I believe in you?  Yeah, that's so nice, Bobby.  Yeah, why would you hit him in the balls like that? 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, see?  First of all, we were fucking around.  Who's the judge?  You the judge?  I'm the judge.  You're the jury?  I'm not a fan of hanging out with guys that like to do ball shots.  I have a brother that's into that.  Exactly.  Thank you, sir.  My brother is so into just ball shotting guys.  What happened?  Did you burn your retinas looking up at the big Dane Cook sign as you walked into the arena?  Is that too mean?  A little bit.  A little bit.  I took a couple shots.  You're going to do it tonight anyways.  What the fuck are you talking about?  That's what I thought.  I thought it was going to be funny.  Like a couple of lugs sitting at a lunch counter.  It wasn't that it wasn't funny. 
[03:45:00]  It was just too wordy.  You're just looking up at the thing and the retinas and the thing.  There's a lot of body parts.  I just don't want to be in trouble for keeping Dane in studio too long.  There's no story.  He was fucking with me.  So you ball shot.  No, he was fucking with me, antagonizing me.  What was I doing?  I don't know.  He was doing some horse shit.  He didn't even know.  He was doing some shit in my face and he did something.  Why did it involve some kind of movement?  It had movement.  I don't know why.  That's all I remember is movement.  That's good to know you guys hate each other.  I love this.  I love it.  So I took the bottle and I didn't throw it like a fucking baseball pitcher. 
[03:45:30]  I tossed it.  A little Fiji bottle.  Tossed it.  It was like a ski ball toss.  Oh, really?  I'm not that good at ski ball though.  Yeah.  He was going for the hundred point.  Hit him in the nut and then he grabbed the iron and pinched my elbow.  Oh, that's fucking great.  We got to hang out.  Yeah.  You're sick like me.  I wish I had it on video.  Yeah.  You videotape everything.  You don't have that?  What are you talking about?  You videotape me fucking my knee.  When I broke my fucking leg, this cocksucker, I look up, he's looking at the camera lady 
[03:46:00]  who wanted to put the camera down and felt bad.  I see him doing the rolls, keep rolling sign, pointing at her.  Old school too, right?  Old school.  Keep it rolling.  But he pointed at her.  I saw her point at her and go, you fucking keep rolling.  And then he does the roll and she puts the camera back up with a tear in her eye.  That's a great moment though.  He captured a man recognizes drama.  That's a true producer though.  I told him, I said, Bobby, I know that a month later you would have been like this.  Dude, you should have rolled in that dude.  You should have.  See, I did it for you, Bobby. 
[03:46:30]  It's one of the greatest video clips ever though.  I'm going to get you the clip that I just got of Bobby and I in 1992.  Oh good, please.  It's crazy weird.  Yeah.  Is this the red VCR tape?  You know what you're doing?  You know what you're doing?  It's our first paid gig, like a check.  And Bobby, you were like mad at Al, who was videoing.  And you go on a rant, a Bobby rant.  Maybe one of the first ones.  I think I might have captured the first like...  Bobby rant.  Bobby rant.  He's like, dude, I told you, dude. 
[03:47:00]  None of you guys believed in it.  I said, we're going to get paid, dude.  And now we're getting paid?  And his hair is just all over the place.  Like Pirates of the Penzance hair.  And now look, dude.  Look at the check.  We get the check.  It's like 85 bucks.  You got to see it.  The Opie and Anthony Channel presents A Very Chipperson Thanksgiving.  You guys know there's only 12 good comics at a time.  More legendary appearances from our favorite stand-up comics coming up.  Double guns, motherfucker. 
[03:47:30]  More memorable O&A appearances from the biggest names in stand-up.  A Very Chipperson Thanksgiving continues on the Opie and Anthony Channel.  This is segment 07.  This is with Jim Brewer and Dennis Leary.  Dennis Leary was talking.  And Jim Brewer just came or something.  And they were talking about doing comedy in the past.  And Jim's got a documentary on his father.  About military veterans.  And how old people think. 
[03:48:00]  I don't know my father.  He's been away for a long time.  He sells encyclopedias.  My mother would always say,  Chippa, your father called, but you wasn't home.  And she said that all those guys that come over are my father's friends and they're helping fix the house.  My father didn't have any white friends.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  Brewer, what the fuck?  You don't say I am.  Hey, Jim Brewer.  Are you doing the stuff I saw you doing?  45.  Fuck, man.  We are fucking old. 
[03:48:30]  Jesus Christ.  We're all old.  You used to be the really young guy.  He was the kid.  Or one of the really young guys.  And now you're 45.  It's true.  How many kids you got?  Three girls.  Three girls.  The oldest is 13.  I got a little kid hanging around the house now.  Oh, man.  I can't believe how old we are.  I'm less sure.  I do, but I can't say that because I don't know if my neighbors listen.  Yeah, you can't do that.  You can't say that.  I think the kid, I'm pretty sure.  Yeah, there's something going on.  He doesn't know yet.  The kid helps my wife decorate.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  No, you're good.  You're good.  Yeah, no, I'm pretty confident. 
[03:49:00]  It's a good problem to have.  He's like, Mr. Brewer, your new shades match your walls.  What 12-year-old child says that?  None.  None.  One that wants to fucking keep coming to the house without the father thinking anything.  He goes, I want to know I'm not over-welcoming my stay.  Am I still okay if I could use your pool?  Yeah, you can do it.  He wears a college shirt.  Wow.  I think I'm all right.  No, you're good.  You're good.  You're good, man.  I feel confident.  Yeah, no, you're all right.  She's 13 and she looks like what? 
[03:49:30]  18?  She looks like she's 18.  Well, maybe he's really smart.  And maybe he's throwing the fucking sight game at you.  That's a good one.  Hey, he's probably too smart, man.  He's pulling up Bull Russell on it.  Yeah, yeah.  He may be doing that.  That could be.  Imagine that.  He's like, hey, listen, I'm going to make your dad think I'm gay.  Yeah.  So he has no idea how deep we're going in this relationship.  Because even now, when he talks to her, he stands really close, but he frails with his 
[03:50:00]  wrist, but he'll touch her arm and stuff.  But she doesn't give an ounce.  She doesn't give an ounce.  She doesn't give.  Have you spoken to her about how far the relationship's going?  Yeah, she shuts it down instantly.  She's like, no.  Yeah.  No.  No.  She has clearly showed who she's liked.  But she's a smart cat, too.  I don't know if she's playing with my emotions, either.  Look at you.  You've got to fucking try to figure all this shit out.  You're going to start dressing like a transvestite just to keep boys away for the next eight  years.  I'd hang out with you more.  That's the only thing I'll keep chicks away. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, you would.  Yeah, you would.  Yeah, you would.  You may even be able to buy me.  Man, the fucking mind games that are going on.  You've got to figure out if they're bullshitting you about their sexuality.  I know how to change it.  I'll bring them to the movie Spider-Man.  Let them sit in the back.  And then I'll see what's going on.  That's what the kids do now, too.  They sit in the back of the movie.  They want to get dropped off of the movie theater.  Oh, shit.  That's what goes on in my town.  I've got a lockdown in my town.  Dropped off of the movie theater.  They sit in the back.  And they pretend they're seeing the movie. 
[03:51:00]  They wait until you turn the corner.  And they go, suck bass.  And this and that.  This and that.  Yeah.  It's a nightmare.  I love that he's saying this like this is a brand new thing.  Yeah.  To me, it is.  This is what we used to do.  That is true.  I remember a fingering girl during Friday the 13th.  During the Defiant one, some guy got blown.  That is Defiant.  It really is.  Oh, my God.  I wasn't in that world for years, though. 
[03:51:30]  I was playing stickball until I was 15, 16.  Yeah.  It's like hockey.  No chicks, though?  Come on.  I would show off with the chicks, but I wasn't trying.  Yeah, you weren't trying.  It wasn't happening, right?  No.  That was all we wanted, though.  My crowd of guys that I hung out with, it was just the fun shit.  We just didn't get it.  And, of course, you knew every girl wanted a fucking 69 Nova full of degenerates.  Right.  You got any friends?  Right.  It's the last thing they wanted.  That 69 Nova. 
[03:52:00]  How much that car's working now?  I know.  It's fucking crazy.  Not after I was done with it.  Jesus Christ.  The Plymouth Duster.  Remember those?  The Plymouth Duster.  That was a great one.  My brother had a Duster.  It's going to Duster tonight.  Fucking A.  I had a Nova.  Chevy Nova.  73 Nova.  Hit the gas, faggy.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Hit the big fucking cars in the back, faggy.  Get the J.C. Whitney catalog and fucking get some good shit for it.  That thing loaded down in the back of, where was it?  Green Acres Mall. 
[03:52:30]  It was the only white guy.  Green Acres Mall.  What the hell is that?  Long Island.  Valley Stream.  Oh, Jesus.  Valley Stream.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  South Shore trash.  I love it.  I love it.  South Shore?  Why trash?  South Shore is trash.  The Long Island.  The fucking expressway is like the main road.  Mason Dixon line of fucking Long Island, man.  It really was.  You stay over there.  I'll stay over here.  You stay over here.  On the North Shore.  What?  What would Carl think?  Oh, Carl.  Oh, wow.  I can't believe you brought Carl up there.  My favorite. 
[03:53:00]  My favorite person living or imagined.  I knew it would be.  Who's Carl?  I remember Carl.  You guys just, he knows why it's coming down the street.  Hey, listen.  The jungle's back the other way there.  Hey, LeBron.  You're out of your neighborhood.  There's no fruits in these trees, if you know what I'm saying.  Yeah, it was one of those neighborhoods.  It was one of those.  Meanwhile, that was my dad.  Drinking the lawn.  Hey, the jungle's back that way, LeBron.  There's no one to mug here. 
[03:53:30]  We're all watching each other.  Hey, did you ever do more of that documentary?  No, but I think I'm going to.  You should, dude.  You should, man.  Well, I've been thinking about it, and I think I may do it in the fall.  I almost called you once from a lobby.  I was just thinking of you, like, fucking, would you keep filming?  You got more there.  No, you're right.  I'm going to film in the fall.  What's the documentary?  Him and his old man.  What is it?  I took my dad until he was 84, 85 at the time. 
[03:54:00]  I brought him on the road.  He's a World War II vet.  Never talks about shit.  Right, of course.  Just talks about chick.  If you ask him, hey, what was the war like?  He goes, Australia was fantastic.  Had us on leave for two weeks.  And that's all he'll go.  So it really was about, you know, I know he's not going to be living much longer.  He's starting to get senile.  Great idea.  I brought him on the road.  It was touching. 
[03:54:30]  It was sad.  It was a little disturbing at times.  It's really good.  It is.  It's really good.  I fucking love it.  From what I saw.  I love it.  That's right up my alley.  But the conclusion should be, there's more information now.  I think he should film more with his dad now.  Yes.  He's getting worse.  See, he can talk about the war.  Maybe you can get him to talk about it.  You know what?  They won't.  They won't.  They won't.  You see in the documentary, I ask him a million times.  But that's okay.  I mean, that would be interesting to watch you try to make him talk about it.  Well, I, not that you'd watch it.  I would watch it.  I'd probe him literally every, we'd go to dinner and I'll go, so what, what, what was 
[03:55:00]  the worst place?  And he'll go, what the fuck do you want to know?  And I'd say, which is the worst?  He goes, they were all worse.  Hey, look at that hot ass.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he doesn't want to know.  Just to flex.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know what?  Shit.  I have Alzheimer's now.  Like, dementia.  I was going to ask you something when you were, oh, so does he mind the cameras when you're 
[03:55:30]  shooting him?  No.  He's a ham and scene stealer.  Oh, okay.  Like, we're in, what's great is because he's older, so we're in a diner and the chick comes  up and I had to edit a lot.  I mean, he drops C words.  He's really.  Are you ever going to keep those in?  I had to edit.  That's great.  Go on.  Were you ever embarrassed?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Like, the one place we were at, we're in the diner and she comes up and he's going, you 
[03:56:00]  know, he's a fag, right?  Like, and then she'd walk away and she's like, yeah, she's a cunt.  She didn't get it.  And then I go, oh, God.  I didn't get it.  And then, like, there's something to get just by pointing at someone saying, I need some  fag.  You need some fag.  You know what I mean?  I get it.  He must be a fag.  I get it.  She didn't get it.  You would, the best thing about him, I used to introduce him to stars, like whenever  it started, and by far the best ever.  Now, this is years ago.  Paul Abdul.  Just to still explain my dad. 
[03:56:30]  I go to the bathroom.  We're finishing the SNL party.  I go to the bathroom and the party's 5,000 people here and you're kissing.  Hey, you're great.  Hey, you're great.  Let's do things together.  I come back.  Let's do things together.  Did they say that at the parties?  Oh, my God.  Every single one.  Yeah, no.  Keep it in touch.  I'm still looking for a job.  Yeah.  I come back and Paul Abdul is with him.  He's laughing. 
[03:57:00]  He's naughty.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Now, I already know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Something transpired.  He goes like this, which to me is still the greatest thing I've ever heard in my life.  He goes, Paula, you like playing puppy?  And she goes, what's puppy?  Hey, that's when I sniff your ass and you just growl.  Oh, my God.  That's like in his eight.  Oh, yeah.  He's fucking, yeah.  Oh, wow. 
[03:57:30]  And she's like, yeah.  Okay.  I'm going to take him home.  Now you think about your dad.  Now you think about your dad and what he was like on the two weeks leave in Australia that  he talks about being the greatest two weeks of his life.  How insane was that trip?  After he took out a week-long shower to take the Japanese blood off his body.  Right.  That you know he saw.  They just strung Mussolini up and killed him and then went to Australia to drink and get  laid for two weeks.  What were they saying that? 
[03:58:00]  Oh, yeah.  I can only imagine what they were.  And they were conquering heroes.  That's right.  They were huge heroes.  And those guys wear those hats.  I always go up to any vet with a hat because they want you to go, hey, man, nice, nice.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Nice fucking hat.  They're wearing the hat.  Thank you so much.  Oh, yeah.  I think last time I was here, right, it was a guy with a hat.  I went up to him and shot bright.  I said, World War II vet, thank you very much.  And he goes, three years, eight months, 22 days, 1942, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:58:30]  We bought it.  Oh, he rattles it off.  He just rattled the whole thing off.  Wow.  Because they want it because they know it's over.  Jap bodies up to my knees as we storm that beach.  I have a flamethrower.  Germans coming at me from the sky.  Japanese coming at me from the ground.  We'd set them on fire so we wouldn't waste bullets.  Right.  Jesus.  Shit that we will never, ever do in our lives.  Can't comprehend it.  Shit.  You know, Durning was on Rescue Me. 
[03:59:00]  And he was landed at Normandy and he was in the Battle of the Bulge.  Jesus.  He's got one half of it.  I think it's his right leg is still black from the frostbite from one of the battles.  And he's got a mark in his chest.  It looks like somebody took a claw hammer and dug it into his chest.  It's from when he was killing a Nazi guy and the guy's hand was clawing as he was crushing  the guy's face with a rock.  Charles Durning?  Charles Durning.  Wow.  Face to face and he's got a reminder like that.  But he never talked about it. 
[03:59:30]  He would never talk about it.  And I couldn't get him to talk about it.  I wrote some, I'd write stuff into the scripts and he would say it, but he would never talk  about it.  Right.  So then I went to do the Memorial Day thing one weekend, you know, when they were on of  the troops on PBS with Joe Mantegna and Sinise in Washington and he was getting honored that  year.  And when I saw him backstage, when he was waiting to be introduced and I saw Colin Powell and  the heads of all four military who were about, you know, to go on stage, walk up individually.  He was sitting down and shake his hand and talk to him. 
[04:00:00]  I went, wow.  He did something.  Because these guys, you know, unbelievable.  Those guys didn't, it's weird.  We never talk about it.  They say that they, a lot of them wish they had therapy and stuff because it was healthier.  The fucking ghost guys just didn't talk about that stuff.  I asked Durning about therapy and this is a famous showbiz story.  I'd heard that he once held a William Morris agent outside the window who didn't pay him  upside down, like 15, 20 stories in the air. 
[04:00:30]  Should night.  Right?  Yeah.  So I asked him one time.  I said, is it true that story about you holding the William Morris agent upside down, like  20 stories in the air?  He goes, it was 15 stories.  And yeah, that was my therapy after the war.  And I was like, holy shit.  Wow.  Well, that's, I also, this, I started learning about my dad by the, by the town bully.  And there was, they were the Della Pines.  And, and when you grew up and anyone that was in jail, you're like, holy shit, fucking 
[04:01:00]  Della Pines are in jail.  Don't fuck with the Della Pines.  Kids stole my bike and all that shit.  It was eight of them.  Three of them were armed robbery.  They were thrown in jail for armed robbery.  But they were out.  So, cut to, I'm 12 years old.  And this is, this is when I realized, like, my dad's, there's something fucking off with  my dad.  My dad is, and he's a little guy.  He's, he's smaller than me.  The main Della Pines is on my front porch.  He rings the bell.  My dad's already passed out from the fucking beer. 
[04:01:30]  My mom's marked to three martinis in.  That was the routine.  And your dad's beer is fucking Sue Simmons.  Sue Simmons, he's out.  He went local.  Yeah, I got to get monkeys.  All monkeys.  All monkeys.  Let's guess who did that.  Monkeys.  Oh, my God.  Stay out the sea.  Stay out there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  They're out.  They're out cold.  Fuck it.  The door rings, Della Pines, at the front door. 
[04:02:00]  I actually have a heart attack.  I'm so scared, I almost start crying.  And he goes, he's looking right past me.  He goes, we want to talk to your father.  And I went, my father's sleeping.  And I look out.  I swear on my children's lives.  There's three of them on my porch.  And there's two standing in my walkway and more outside their car, leaning against the  car.  And I go, my dad's sleeping.  I feel a claw grab me, pull me aside. 
[04:02:30]  And my father walks out on the patio.  And he goes, what is it?  Fucking one, two, three, four, five, seven.  How many car?  Yeah, three fags.  There's seven of you for one little old man.  He goes, you may get the best of me, but one of you are going to fucking die.  Which one's it going to be?  Is it going to be you?  Is it going to be you?  Which one of you little fucks are going to die tonight? 
[04:03:00]  Because you're going to watch one of you fuckers die.  And my mom's like, Jesus Christ, you're in the goddamn house and we're calling the cops and  his son's a cop.  And the whole fucking deli.  Now the oldest brother's going, we're just, we're just, you hit a chain.  You hit my little brother with a chain.  And he takes out of his back pocket the dog leash, which we had a poodle.  A little poodle.  And he's like, this is what you're worried about.  He goes, again, you got five seconds because I want to get it on. 
[04:03:30]  Who's going to die?  And they were like, oh, we really apologize.  You fucking mean it.  And they left.  And that was a defining moment the rest of my life.  I just, I looked at my dad like, were you fucking crazy?  Do you know they have guns?  He didn't care.  Guns?  See, I would have loved to have one of the Delapines die in that story.  Right? 
[04:04:00]  Yeah.  Right?  From a death blow to the neck.  As your father throws a warning shot.  What's that?  What's that?  The blood coming out of every hole in his head.  He just hits the fucking neck.  What does he give a fuck?  He was in World War II?  He doesn't give a fuck about the Delapines?  Fuck you.  That's when I realized.  I love your dad.  I do too.  I haven't even met him, but I love him.  I can't wait to see this fucking documentary.  That is great.  It really is good, Dennis.  You're going to love it, man.  It really is good.  A lot more people should be seeing this damn thing.  You'll fucking love it.  It's hot, man.  How long is it? 
[04:04:30]  It's an hour.  I'll make it longer.  You told me, and you really made me think about it.  I'm definitely going to do it.  I got to, you know, now I got a nurse, so you got to clean.  He wears diapers and shit.  So it's, you know, on that trip, he shit three times.  Oh, man.  That's a rough thing to clean up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's fun to do for a film.  You should film more if you can, though.  I am.  I am.  I just booked a whole fall tour.  Oh, you did.  I want to get a bus and just film the shit out of him. 
[04:05:00]  Because he's still funny.  Yeah, he fucking sounds it, man.  The ambulance comes over the house.  He looks like he's dying, right?  Everything out of his mouth is always funny.  He always tries to be funny, no matter what.  They go, Mr. Brewer, you okay?  You're in pain?  He goes, yeah, I'm in pain.  Where's it her?  He goes, I'm pregnant.  I don't know who the father is.  I wouldn't tell you, because then you'd start rumors. 
[04:05:30]  Oh, my God.  While he's drooling and his heads are twitching.  Can you imagine what he was like in the war?  Oh, man.  He literally was like that guy from Die Hard doing a fucking one-liner,  wise-ass one-liners while he was killing people.  Non-stop.  He must have been a fucking blast to hang out with in the war.  Well, you know what's funny?  Oh, man.  I would say so, because as I grew up, he was just a dad.  And it was my college year where kids would go,  you're a brewer, because he's a lot older.  Everyone thinks he's a grandfather.  They go, you're father. 
[04:06:00]  Does he drive a garbage truck?  I go, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I had your father for the time.  He's the funniest fucking guy I ever met in my life.  I'm like, my dad is the funniest fucking guy.  And as I got older, I mean, he started fights at town halls.  Wow.  What a hero.  He was the clown of clowns.  What a hero.  But I didn't realize that as I got older.  So that's another reason I made the documentary.  You never had any war buddies come over or anything like that? 
[04:06:30]  They all worked together.  They all, as it's really said, they all worked together at the sanitation place.  They all got each other jobs.  And two of his best friends died of a heart attack.  They were all heavy fucking drinkers.  Yeah.  Can you blame them?  No, one hung himself and one shot himself.  Jesus Christ.  My dad was the only one.  Wow.  My dad was the only one.  That's hardcore, man.  Yeah.  That's crazy right there. 
[04:07:00]  But that makes sense, doesn't it?  When you think about it.  Like the horrors that they saw.  What they must have been through.  You can't even fucking fathom.  But he never.  And what I thought was amazing, which I brought out in the doc, is that he never put all that  on me.  Right.  He was just a dad.  Right.  Right.  He was there at the games.  He was there at the thing.  He never was like, you know, you fucking.  Even when I had my dangling cross-searing and Judas Priest on the bag, like, fucking Judas  Priest, dad.  And the singer, like, yeah.  He's like, yeah. 
[04:07:30]  That's great.  That's great.  It's great music.  Never.  Kept it inside.  Can you imagine what he would have said?  I'm going to love him.  No, can you imagine?  Oh, my God.  I do.  You've got to love him for that shit, man.  He's fucking A.  What a guy.  What a guy.  Yeah, he could have been that.  I defended him country for this shit.  Yeah, this is what I defend him for.  To wear your faggot earring and fucking.  How's your mom doing?  I just love that he was out cold.  Just that story about the Della Pines, where he's out cold after Sue Simmons. 
[04:08:00]  But as soon as there's a whiff of trouble for his son, not only is he wide awake, he's  moved the son out of the way and has taken on 15 Della Pines and doesn't give a fuck  because at least, I mean, you've got to, that's a dad.  That's a dad.  Fuck you.  That's a dad.  I love that.  There's like two or three of those incidents that I'll remember forever and ever.  Fucking great, bro.  It's like an animal.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Five, ten brothers and sisters, five, just the opposite of band of brothers. 
[04:08:30]  All five went to the war.  All five came back.  Wow.  One was shot down in Germany.  One was a prisoner of war.  I know.  Wow.  The old one came back.  My uncle Jerry came to this country and was here and to get his citizenship had to join  the army.  So he went to Korea and fought.  Again, came back and he was fucked up and was strapped.  He always acted like he had a great time, like it was the easiest thing in the world.  But when he died and the guys that he served with came to his funeral, this is like two  years ago, we started hearing all this shit about, oh yeah, no, we used to, you know, 
[04:09:00]  we used to be afraid of him because he was so fucking crazy and they showed us pictures.  We're looking at pictures of him on the front and we're going, he fucking told us he was  like back, you know, behind the seat.  At a motor pool.  Yeah, never said anything.  You know, it was like, I just, they fucking locked it up.  They locked it up.  Threw it away.  Threw it away.  Whiskey.  And the, oh, that's why.  Whiskey.  Whiskey.  Whiskey.  Whiskey.  Smoke, smoke, smoke.  Whiskey.  Whiskey.  Whiskey.  Right?  Meanwhile, you're going like, you know, you're thinking everything's fine with him. 
[04:09:30]  Now when he dies, you go, fucking guy was crazy.  Right.  Right.  Thank God he didn't kill you.  Right?  Thank fucking God.  When I think about how scary our dads were, you know, about like when we fucked up, when  they, I don't know if your dad ever threw a shot at you.  Oh, man.  He never threw a shot at you.  My dad threw a shot at my older brother who challenged him once, Kiwi.  Kiwi was my, he came home drunk after a fight.  My uncle Danny was a police officer.  He was called and said, he was fucking in a fight with a bunch of guys with shovels.  My dad was like, that cock sucker.  And he came home and he walked in the front door. 
[04:10:00]  He was already drunk and he went to the refrigerator and he opened it up and he grabbed the beer.  And my old man went, you crack open that beer, I'll knock you out with one fucking punch.  And my brother was huge.  You know, he's bigger than my dad.  And he cracked the beer.  And I'll never forget it.  He hit him and he was like slow motion.  He went backwards and he, his head hit the linoleum.  He was already out.  So hard.  My mother went, you killed him.  And my old man, he hit him and he walked away and lit up a cigarette.  Like I told him I was going to fucking hit him.  Right.  When you think about what's really in their heads from World War II. 
[04:10:30]  Right.  No.  Crazy.  It is pretty wild.  It's nuts, man.  It's amazing they could live a normal life, you know.  That's what blows me away too.  I learned a lot.  Because I have sisters and that.  Yeah.  Fucking this happened to me as a kid.  Anyone that brings up the violin story.  Yeah.  Pretty much about anything.  Like, listen.  Fuck off.  Fuck off.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  These guys are everything.  And they did what you saw.  They were great Americans.  Hey, listen.  And that fucking cliche is true. 
[04:11:00]  We wouldn't fucking be here if they didn't win that fucking war.  It's that simple.  They took on the whole fucking world and kicked the world's ass and came home.  Right.  And then kept their mouths shut.  And gave us like plasma fucking TVs.  Right.  And all the shit that we have comes from those.  That's why we have this shit.  Nothing but legendary appearances from the biggest names in comedy.  A very Chipperson Thanksgiving continues.  Here's your host, Lyle Chip Chipperson.  This is segment A. 
[04:11:30]  Jay Moore.  He does the second best impression.  I do a good Harvey Keitel's too.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's going to hit the ball or something.  Hey, talk about doing Clint Eastwood.  I do a good Clint Eastwood.  Yeah, punk.  Make my day or something.  This is a Chipperson Thanksgiving.  And I hope everybody enjoyed it.  Go have some turkey or something.  My mother would always say,  Now, Chippa, we're going to make a wish after,  so don't put the wishbone in your hiney. 
[04:12:00]  Hey, happy thanks.  Fucking turkey, cocksucker.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  On SiriusXM.  But that scene where you said Clint yelled at that lady,  I just couldn't wait for that scene.  What exactly did he say to her?  Sweetheart, where is she?  Keep going.  Keep rolling.  I cannot possibly explain how little this fucking movie is about you.  Christ, I could have hired your arm if the union would have let me. 
[04:12:30]  Let's do it again and not make a big fucking deal out of it.  Got a lot of talent out here.  Wow.  And he just jogged back.  And I was like, oh, my God.  And she was embarrassed.  And he went, P-U-S-S-Y.  Really?  Did I ever tell you that?  No, not the spelling.  He asked me if I wanted to,  Jay, would you like to join me for a Czechoslovakian beer?  And I said, no.  And he goes, well, then I guess you're done for the day.  But he said it like, you fucking faggot.  You sicken me.  And I was like, going back to my hotel in the van, 
[04:13:00]  like, did I just get fucking fired?  And I was thinking, talking about an addict brand,  I'm like, will I work more if I just have this beer?  Like, I'll just fucking pound beers with Clint.  We're done for the day.  It's three in the afternoon.  And I'll just go to a fucking midnight meeting after a nap.  And said, look, I had to.  Clint said, like, maybe I would have been in fucking J. Edgar Hoover right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  And I go, no.  And he goes, well, then I guess you're done for the day.  But he said it like Dirty Harry.  So it's so freaky.  And we come back the next night or two nights later. 
[04:13:30]  And we're the same night as that gal.  I would have hired your fucking arm if they would have let me.  And he says, how long has it been since you had alcohol in your body?  And I go, I don't know.  98, I guess.  And he goes, that's good.  Is your mic on?  And I go, yeah.  And he goes, cover it up.  So I cover my mic with my hand and my shirt.  But, like, Matt Damon and Richard Kine.  Like, everyone.  And the boom guy.  Like, they're still all mics.  And he goes, my problem was never booze or drugs.  My problem was always P-U-S-S-Y. 
[04:14:00]  And I thought, did he just fucking spell it so no one could hear it?  Like a crazy person.  And he goes, let's do it again.  And I'm like, now I got to go act knowing Dirty Harry's a pussy addict.  Yeah.  That's all you can think about now.  I don't even know my lines.  And he's like, all I can think of is like, P-U-S-S-Y.  Box, box, big hairy 70s box.  And I had no lines because it was that scene.  That is fantastic.  That's awesome.  He spelt it. 
[04:14:30]  Could you have just hung with him and not had the beer?  Like, I would have said, no, but I'll have a soda and hung with him.  He doesn't want to hang with a guy.  It was, would you like to stay and join me for a Czechoslovakian beer?  And it wasn't going to be.  Specific fucking bizarre request.  Jimmy, would you like to sit with me and make tiny orange socks knitting?  Wow.  If I had a beer, you have to look at, if you had a beer, you would have had the beer, but  then you would have woke up somewhere and went like, what?  You would have had weird memories of him going like, what the fuck are you doing? 
[04:15:00]  You would have just been doing dirty Harry lines at him until he left?  I think you'd take, I would have just kept doing fucking Escape from Alcatraz when he  dropped the N-bomb.  Oh, exactly.  I just don't like niggers.  Jimmy, Jesus.  He said that.  That's what he said.  I know, but we're corporate men now.  Let's say, look, one of the greatest lines.  I noticed that.  I just hate niggers.  What's the matter?  You keep to yourself or you just don't like niggers?  He goes, the English, he goes, there's two reasons you didn't sit on my step.  You scared boy, or you just don't, or you just hate niggers. 
[04:15:30]  That's what he said to Clint Eastwood.  Believe me, I know.  He just doesn't want to say.  Oh, please.  It's a great fucking, it's an amazing moment between him and Paul Benjamin.  Right on.  I was there.  I actually went to Alcatraz and I fucking sat.  I was on, you're like Keitel in Bad Lieutenant.  I was on the set.  I saw him before that take.  He told me he's saying nigger.  Come on, Cal Daniels.  I went there and I sat on that step because it was actually shot in there.  And I love that scene so fucking much.  He walks up a few steps and then he comes back down.  That yard at Alcatraz is just amazing. 
[04:16:00]  Oh, fantastic.  And so, a very chippers in Thanksgiving draws to a close.  Listen for more throughout the weekend.  And happy holidays from the Opie and Anthony channel.
