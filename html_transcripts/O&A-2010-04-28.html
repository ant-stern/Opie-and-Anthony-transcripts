<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion centered on comedian Louie Anderson (initially misidentified as Bob Kelly), filled with offensive jokes targeting his physical appearance and making crude allegations about his childhood. This led into a Family Feud parody,  ridiculing Anderson with sexually suggestive and vulgar questions and answers about his supposed eating habits.  The segment was rife with homophobic and sexually explicit language.

A caller’s criticism of the hosts’ treatment of Louie Anderson only fueled further mockery.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to the topic of using incarcerated individuals for cheap labor, generating graphic and offensive jokes about prisoners' potential conduct in agricultural settings.  A female caller attempting to contribute to the discussion was met with dismissive and insulting remarks from Opie and Anthony. The show continued with the hosts discussing their relationship with someone they referred to as a "Nazi," along with negative comments about a previous guest's father. The segment concluded with jokes about the hosts' potential future engagements at low-budget, unsavory events. Profanity was used liberally throughout the entire broadcast segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's Sam.  Hey, it's E-Rod from Opie and Anthony.  More O&A coming up.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah?  You know when Anthony likes to tell that story about a fat comic who was abused as a kid,  used to get hit with a whiskey bottle?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, but I don't understand why he keeps talking about show friend Bob Kelly like that.  I didn't know.  And it was awkward with Bob sitting in the studio right next to him.  Maybe he was actually talking about Louie Anderson.  No, I think it was Bob Kelly.  Probably right.  You listen.  I have radio shows calling me fat, contributing to my already low self-esteem, high weight. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, God, Louie.  Leave Louie alone.  Louie had a tough life with whiskey bottles.  Whiskey bottles being thrown at me by my abusive father and my enabling mother.  Survey says.  Survey says homosexual.  Top ten answers on the board to this. 
[00:01:00]  What does Louie like in his a**?  Show me big black a**?  In school, I was just made fun of.  I was poked fun of in school, and now I'm poked by big a**.  Oh, here we go.  Ah, family feud.  We're going to be playing the feud.  Dude, it's a coincidence that I host this game show, Family Feud, because I've been  in a lot of family feuds over what I do while I'm babysitting. 
[00:01:30]  It's a child abuse joke.  I'm insinuating that he abuses and molests children.  All right.  Surveyed our audience and top ten answers on the board to what's Louie's favorite food?  Louie's favorite food.  Okay, they're trying to decide who's going to go up and press the little thing to tell  who goes first.  Jeez, this takes forever. 
[00:02:00]  Okay.  Thanks, E-Rock.  Louie E-Rock Anderson.  All right.  Is it steak?  Is it steak?  No, it's not steak.  You have a chance to steal on this one now.  A chance to steal.  Michelle, what's Louie's favorite food?  Uh, your answer is, uh, man-  Yes, it is.  It's big, hairy, man-  I eat it like pudding. 
[00:02:30]  I love it.  I like a nice musky smell.  Uh, like when a man knows he's got a shower after sitting on the bowl.  You ever sit there and just know you got a shower?  It's wafting up.  You do a courtesy flush and realize it's you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, young boys. 
[00:03:00]  Wasn't a question.  I'm just saying.  I love them.  You got it!  Yeah!  You got it!  What's that?  AIDS?  If I got AIDS, it would take me 20 years to wither away.  Tim H. from Columbus.  I like how you said, leave Louie alone, and immediately start making fun of him. 
[00:03:30]  I'm just thinking of that.  I'm like-  You guys are ruthless, he writes.  Hang on.  Leave Louie alone.  Leave Louie alone.  Yeah.  Then we hammer him way more than they ever even-  Leave Louie alone.  The O.B. and Anthony show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  Why don't we use people that are currently incarcerated in our prison systems and have them work off their  own tab for being arrested?  And then that solves all of our problems with legal aliens and the economy working in low  level farm jobs.  I think they do that to a point. 
[00:04:00]  They get some convicts out there on the-  Do they?  Yeah, but you know, you don't want fucking-  Not enough.  Murderers and rapists out there picking your shit, putting strawberries up their ass, throwing  them in the basket.  Is it just angry?  They're just mad at being in prison.  They're all chocolate covered in fucking strawberries.  Yeah.  What happened?  What the hell, man?  The guy who was arrested of putting a prostitute in a bear trap is now cleaning your lettuce.  Yeah.  I don't want that.  I don't think I like that either.  That could be a problem, Jimmy.  Yeah.  That's-  What happens is the incompetence in teachers is what's causing this problem, stupid. 
[00:04:30]  Sarah, comment on that?  I can't hear you.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, right.  Of course you can't.  You have no answer for that, do you?  I can't hear you.  I'm sorry.  Yes, you can.  You just got no answer for it, as usual, with the teachers ruining this country.  I'm sorry.  I don't know what you're-  My phone's not working.  Yeah, exactly.  Good.  I thought so.  This must be what it's like in your classroom.  You don't understand the student.  Jimmy's the student.  You're the teacher, and she's gone. 
[00:05:00]  All right.  That was mean, Jimmy.  I did.  Of course.  Mean Jimmy, but maybe her phone wasn't working.  Oh, no.  I held up a sign that said Mean Jimmy, and I was going to do it to the next caller.  I love Mean Jimmy.  But then she was still there.  I just decided to.  Talk about it quite a bit.  We got books on him.  I bought him books.  Not about Nazism, but about the war.  And he liked reading about that.  And I had a friend that was a Nazi that I used to do antique shows with.  How is this?  I agree, old. 
[00:05:30]  How is this helping?  What a fucking asshole.  I had a friend that was a Nazi.  God, Jesse James, your dad's a douche.  I just want you to know I love you very much.  But what you were doing to yourself, I cannot stand by and watch the hee hee hee hee.  Shut up.  Just get up and backhand her.  And they have help writing their letters.  I want to see these people without letters.  How awful.  Their speeches would be.  Their speeches would be horrendous.  Because they're just reading them.  Right.  And it's horrible.  Let's not laugh at this too hard. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, yes.  Because we all realize we're going to wind up in a fucking karaoke basement in Long Island  sooner or later, reading our letters.  As I walked out, I was going, oh, this is a party?  Yeah, it is.  We're all wearing hats that have boo on them and Anthony with an X across his face.  Opie and Anthony live next.  Opie and Anthony live next. 
[00:06:30]  Opie and Anthony live next. 
[00:07:00]  Opie and Anthony live next. 
[00:07:30]  Opie and Anthony live next.  Opie and Anthony live next. </pre>
