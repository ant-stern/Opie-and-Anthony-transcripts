<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment featuring E-Rock and Primetime Sam Roberts.  The focus was on two 911 calls: one from Tim Peeler describing a Bigfoot encounter in North Carolina (detailed account of its size, appearance, and whistling), and another from Freddie Willight, who shot his wife, claiming she "enticed" him. CNN's lack of skepticism regarding the Bigfoot story was criticized. The show also touched upon an oil spill, speculating about a possible Obama administration conspiracy.  Bill Burr then joined the studio, sparking a heated debate about racial dynamics in America, particularly comparing the treatment of Black and white people expressing racist views, focusing on the Black Israelites in Times Square.  Anthony and Bill clashed over white guilt and responsibility, with callers James (Canada) and Q (New Orleans) contributing to the discussion.  The segment concluded with a return to the Bigfoot story, oil spills, and shark videos.  Profanity and offensive language permeated the entire segment.

The show continued with a discussion about the firing of a 50-year career journalist for controversial opinions on Jewish displacement; the hosts and numerous callers (Matt, Joey, Ness, Jim, Justin, Tony, Andrew, Nick, Kevin, Max, and Kate) debated whether her comments were genuinely anti-Semitic or a misinterpretation, and the sincerity of her apology.  The segment also delved into relationship dynamics and frustrations men experience, such as being forced to watch disliked TV shows (including "American Idol" and a Super Bowl commercial recap show), chick flicks ("The Love Letter," "Bridges of Madison County," "How Stella Got Her Groove Back"), and other partner-selected activities.  Technology (laptops, video games like PS3 and Half-Life, online games like Farmville and Poker) was cited as a source of conflict. Callers shared anecdotes about relationship issues, including one about a relationship ending due to OCD and kleptomania, and another describing a prolonged relationship conflict. Opie mentioned being in a relationship with a "very hot girl," and the hosts joked about their experiences.

A subsequent segment was dominated by a video of a special needs prom, with the hosts and callers repeatedly using the word "retarded" while making offensive comments about the teenagers' appearance and dancing.  Patrice O'Neal, present in the studio, then launched into a lengthy, highly offensive rant filled with racist stereotypes and generalizations about Chinese, Asian, Jewish, and Indian people.  This included comments on Chinese people's perceived cheapness, negative stereotypes about Asian men's penises, and generalizations about Indian women's happiness and behavior.  Numerous callers contributed to the offensive commentary, interspersed with commercial breaks.

The show continued with further discussion focused on negative stereotypes about Asian people, fueled by callers' anecdotes about their experiences with Asian business owners (dry cleaners, laundromats, restaurants).  One caller recounted a confrontation with an Asian woman in a wheelchair; another found humor in a bizarre Japanese game show.  The hosts and callers compared experiences with Asian, Black, and white-owned businesses, using offensive language and racial stereotypes.  The show later shifted to a discussion of the 1970s TV show "Quincy, M.E.," with Andy Levy and Bill Schultz from "Red Eye" (Fox News), Jim Norton, and Anthony Cumia in studio.  They mocked the show's plotlines and acting.  The segment also featured Bob Kelly and Jay Moore in studio, engaging in comedic banter and impressions, including a story about a chaotic live performance with Tracy Morgan at Princeton University that nearly resulted in Morgan's arrest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, this is Jay Moore, you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Isn't all of it the worst?  Hosted by Primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock.  Alright, well it's the worst of Opie and Anthony, I'm E-Rock and joining me as always is Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony aren't here, so when they're not here, we're here, whether you like it or not.  Trust me, we'd much rather be at home, but we have a service to perform, and that service is for all of you,  and that service is hosting the Opie and Anthony's worst of show.  And how much do we get paid for that?  For that in particular, well it's a very small figure, but we won't get into that.  E-Rock, we have a huge worst of show to do.  So, as a matter of fact, it's too big for us to sit here just talking about it. 
[00:01:00]  Let's start this thing.  Sam, Bigfoot was spotted in North Carolina.  Ah!  We're not in North Carolina.  Woo!  We're in New York City.  Ah!  Why is that, uh...  The big city's scary.  We're on the 36th floor, look out that window.  Woo!  Well, we were spotted in North Carolina, and of course the news has to jump on top of it,  because there's just some dumb hillbilly telling this story.  And, because of primetime Sam Roberts, we get a treat, and we get to listen to his 911 call.  As he informed the operator, he didn't want to kill this Bigfoot monster, 
[00:01:30]  but if Bigfoot wouldn't stop messing with his dogs, he was going to have to.  Eric, I think he was intoxicated.  Maybe he was just asking for permission and being polite.  That's true.  Well, Eric, either way, he called 911 because there was a monster in his backyard.  And he's a drunk hillbilly.  That he is.  Hillbilly Jim!  Really?  I want to get a photo.  Not really.  Nothing fun, nothing happy.  You're listening.  Nothing happy, nothing fun.  To the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Nothing fun, nothing happy.  Or the virus.  Nothing happy, nothing fun. 
[00:02:00]  Sirius XM.  Bobby, there's a guy that sees Bigfoot.  Can you get the video of this, too?  Danny, I'm sorry.  No!  Please.  No!  Can we play it off that so it syncs up?  You think the audio would be good?  The original one.  And then we got an update.  Oh, the first one.  Right.  There's this guy.  He kind of looks like Artie Lang.  He's in North Carolina.  And he swears he's seen Bigfoot.  And CNN is playing this like it's a real story without going, holy shit, this guy's out of his fucking mind.  Really? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Which frustrates me.  Because although it's a fun story to check out for the radio show, it's like, you're CNN.  Why don't you fucking call this guy out on his horse shit?  But they don't.  So this is the original clip.  We'll have it in a sec.  And then we have an update.  A good update, by the way.  Why is Sam running in here?  Uh-oh.  What's up, Sam?  It's just the 911 call.  Is that bad?  No, I know.  I'm playing the original first.  Right, but the CNN clip is, uh... 
[00:03:00]  They actually treated it.  They said there were...  They added it to other crazy 911 calls.  Oh, well...  But the 911 call by itself is funny.  Tim calls 911.  Right.  That's just the 911 call.  Yeah, that's good.  Okay.  That's the update, though.  Okay.  Right?  To the original story?  Yeah, just making sure because you were referencing the CNN clip from this morning.  Oh, yeah.  It was on CNN again this morning.  That's all.  Okay.  Okay.  Ah, commercial.  We got it.  Ah, the commercial. 
[00:03:30]  Is this a 30-second commercial?  Wasn't this 15 seconds yesterday?  They always used to be.  They were like 10 seconds at first.  Oh, my God.  Enough.  Internet commercials.  Now it's just...  They got to pay for it somehow, don't they?  10 seconds before a video starts.  It's really...  It really has thrown a wrench in on the...  Ah, it's a pain in the ass.  Wanting to put videos on the radio.  Video on the radio.  Yeah.  Here it is.  I tried to call them.  Tim Peeler thought he was calling coyotes. 
[00:04:00]  Instead of them, him.  He got something that frightened even the self-proclaimed mountain man.  This thing was 10 foot tall.  He had beautiful hair.  It scared me.  Sergeant Mark Self is a Cleveland County deputy.  He didn't see the creature this time.  There was a 8 to 10 foot hairy man looking person.  But remembers the stories of a Sasquatch when he was a kid. 
[00:04:30]  Was killing some animals, breaking in chicken houses, killing chickens.  It's the same M.O. that Tim says he saw for himself.  The Sasquatch going after his dogs.  I come out here.  Cheer.  Cheer.  And rough talk to him and run him off.  Rough talk to him.  Got him to leave.  Called 911.  Then the creature came back.  And I said, get away from here.  Get.  Get.  The fight's reenacting right now. 
[00:05:00]  Deputies filed a suspicious person report.  And Tim is still recalling the details.  He looked like he had six fingers on each hand.  Fucking Jesus Christ.  But even though sworn to serve and protect.  This is just totally blowing my mind that it's even brought back up.  Are left manning up, at least for the cameras.  Doesn't bother me now.  I don't think there's anything to it.  Didn't bother me now.  So that guy swears he's seeing Bigfoot in North Carolina.  That guy rules. 
[00:05:30]  And they reference a 911 call.  Now I know what Sam's talking about.  We got the 911 call.  Because in the piece they say he called 911.  So we got that.  Right.  Cheer.  What is he referring?  Queensland County 911.  Hello.  Can I help you?  Yes.  This is Tim Fugler.  Uh-huh.  Go ahead.  Right. 
[00:06:00]  You probably have my address.  Yes, sir.  What's going on now?  This beast is playing.  Possibly in the description.  My dog.  I've got five dogs.  Bear dogs and hog dogs.  He's hammered.  And I found a light on this thing. 
[00:06:30]  But I would not shoot it.  Okay.  What did it look like?  It looked like a giant angel with a man's face.  But I was afraid to kill it.  And it made a whistling sound.  A whistling sound. 
[00:07:00]  CNN had heard this clip, but then they don't have a story.  It made a whistling sound.  And I said, get.  I rough talked it.  I rough talked it.  Oh, my God.  You know how many times the N-words just flown out of that guy's mouth?  Just flown out.  You see his technique of fending off Bigfoot with that stick, though, Bobby?  I said, get out of here.  You don't belong in our schools.  I made my stick into a gun.  Now you got to go. 
[00:07:30]  He was play-acting with his little stick.  Get your own drink and fainting.  Jesus Christ, man.  I'm going to hit the bell.  Oh, God.  Well, that guy is the.  We got more to the call, too.  That guy is the equivalent of anything I bring up as far as black people doing stuff.  That guy is the equivalent of making Whitey look just like idiots.  Yeah, but I could talk to that fucking guy for 10 fucking days. 
[00:08:00]  I'd love to sit down and just listen to his stories.  Yeah, Bobby, you know sometimes I'm lonely.  Sometimes the revenuers show up and I got to shut the steel down.  The whistles, too.  Fucking Bigfoot plays the flute.  Bigfoot whistles and has beautiful hair.  What if Bigfoot really did play the flute?  He was just out in the woods.  That's what he did.  Bigfoot whistles and Star Trek songs. 
[00:08:30]  Star Wars.  Yeah, yeah.  That's his favorite song.  How the fuck do you know the whole song, you fucking nerd?  I'm glad you said it. 
[00:09:00]  It really is a nerd.  He doesn't want people to know.  Dude, he really is a nerd.  Dude, there should be a point where you forget that.  Exactly.  You know the whole thing on the fucking...  That's the bar music!  Oh my god.  Dude.  You shouldn't be on a cool radio show.  You should be fucking writing for Gizmodo.  You faggot. 
[00:09:30]  The fuck?  What the fuck do you know?  I like to toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  I would know the first four notes of the Star Wars song.  Dude, maybe.  I know some classics, too.  Yeah.  Covered with cheese.  No, it's from Chariots of Fire  Oh  Right? 
[00:10:00]  I don't know  Is that the theme?  What is it?  Chariots of Fire  Is that the fucking gay movie?  It's Jethro Tell  Can you do Beverly Hills Cop?  Wait, what was the last one?  Oh, Jethro Tell, right?  Yeah  And you can hire Anthony from parties, bar mitzvahs, weddings 
[00:10:30]  What was that other one?  Jethro Tell?  Yeah  What was it, Bungle?  That was it  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun  Yeah, yeah, locomotor, bro  Yeah, yeah, yeah  What do you do?  You practice on your cock when you're home and you don't have that  Yes  I fucking squeeze my balls  You put a straw in your dick hole 
[00:11:00]  It's my toodly-doo flute  We got more of the 911 call from this Tim guy with the Bigfoot  Billy in Jersey, by the way, writes  Bigfoot enticed me my entire life  He enticed me  What is that?  Oh, fuck  That was another drunk 911 call with some guy that shot his wife  Fuck it, E-Rock, go get that for us  And he just tells the 911 operator that  She enticed me  And you can just tell he was so annoyed he needed to shoot her 
[00:11:30]  Fuck it  Travis just got it right away  You want the long one or just that little clip?  How long you got?  Well, the entire call is two minutes  Fuck it, what else are we doing today?  Yeah, let her rip  I love this one  This is what we're referencing  North Richland Hills, 911  That's it  Hello?  This is Freddie Willight  How can I help you?  I shot my wife in the stomach with 38  What address are you at?  84-32  Is she still there?  Yeah, she's lying on the floor  And what is your name?  Freddie Willight 
[00:12:00]  I killed Donald Hargreaves  Where's the gun at?  What?  Where's the gun?  It's in the closet  What is her name?  Donna  Is there anybody else there with you?  No  Okay  Why did you do this?  She enticed me  And she would ridicule me  Throughout my lifetime 
[00:12:30]  Okay, and you're at  84-32?  That's it, baby  Okay, I'm going to get somebody out there  Where out in the house are you right now?  Well, I'm in the dining room  I don't know if she's dead or not  How long ago did this happen?  A few minutes  Okay  I'll see if she's alive 
[00:13:00]  Sir?  You're alive?  What are you here?  Do what?  He said he shot a wife in the stomach  You're there?  Are you there?  Sir, I'm here  I think she's dead  Okay  Is there anybody else in the house with you?  No  I'm peaceable, it's okay 
[00:13:30]  Okay, sir, it's okay  I understand  I've got help coming up there  I just want to stay on the line with you  Until they get there  Okay, okay  And then I'll go down  I'm sorry?  I'll go down  Okay  Okay, are you all right?  How great is that?  I'm peaceable  Did I hear him call her a stupid cunt?  Whisper a stupid cunt?  Did you hear that?  Really? 
[00:14:00]  I didn't hear that  You didn't hear stupid  She's a stupid cunt  I don't know  You didn't hear that?  That's just not in your head all the time  The best part is checking if she's alive or dead  You're alive?  Or dead?  Or dead  Well, I like how he's practicing good gun safety  Because he says  They ask where the gun is  And he says in the closet  So he shot his wife  And put his gun away  I put my gun away  I'm not stupid  She enticed me  The way he said it  He goes  She enticed me  That was years of just  Her ragging his ass 
[00:14:30]  He didn't start  He said my whole life  My whole life  Oh my god  You're just waiting, man  You're just waiting  Fucking rednecks are fascinating people, man  He probably finally took his trip to the Grand Canyon  And said, okay  Now it's time  It's time  Oh my god  Hey, let's get back to the Bigfoot guy  Who supposedly is on the line  If that's him  Can we make sure he doesn't go anywhere?  Oh, I'm sure it's him  We'll see  Yes, it's him  We'll see 
[00:15:00]  But we got Tim  Talking to 911 about Bigfoot in his yard  It continues  But I just wanted y'all to know  I have not shot one or killed one  Okay, was there more than one or just the one?  Just the one  Okay  He was about  Nine, ten foot tall 
[00:15:30]  With real long arms  And  I've had experiences with him before  In the deer stand  But this one  Somehow  I go out there  He gets gone  Then I come back in the house  And he gets back there again  And my nose is just raising 
[00:16:00]  Head  Didn't want to say hell, I guess  Yeah, yeah  He's a God-fearing man  He said he had come across him  Before  In the deer stand  It's like when he's hunting  Bigfoot will come up  And kind of say hi to him  Yeah  Wow  That guy is one of those  Backwards motherfuckers  I could fucking hang with him for weeks  Just  Oh  He might get that opportunity  Because he might be on the line  But first  The 911 call continues 
[00:16:30]  So I go back out of my gun  And my spotlight  And he goes back into the woods  And then I bring my gun  And my spotlight in  About 10 more minutes  He does the same thing again  So he came through more than one  No, it's one 
[00:17:00]  But he said he did the same thing again  Oh, no, he thinks it's more than one  Would I get in any trouble  If I shot and killed this beast  This animal  Or whatever it is  Would I get in any trouble  I can't answer that question  Yeah  Well, that's the way I am 
[00:17:30]  That's the way I am  God damn me  We've all talked to this guy  In our lives  Jesus Christ  What you want to do  Is go down two blocks  I'll take you if you want to go  That's the  The best part of this  Is the fact that  He sees the Bigfoot  Yeah  Apparently the Bigfoot's  Not fucking with him  Right?  Yeah  But his big question is  Can I shoot it?  It's really a great question  Can I 
[00:18:00]  You should be able  To answer that question  If it's Bigfoot  Yes, of course you can shoot it  Yeah, but like  Can you  If you shoot Bigfoot  Is that like  That's an endangered species  If you kill the only  Fucking Bigfoot around  Yeah, yeah  You drag its fat head  Into your house  He's the guy  Yeah  Like in the bar  In the next  For the next years  He'd be like  Hey, that's the asshole  That shot fucking Bigfoot  The last one  And you'd be in the corner  Trying to tell somebody  Hey, we're ten foot tall  If he was an inch  If I 
[00:18:30]  Whatever that means  If I  If I could have it  Do all over again  I wouldn't even look  Exit that Bigfoot  So I pointed my rifle at him  Because he enticed me  But it turns out  To be a stick  So he came at me  What an asshole  The best accent ever  Oh, he is just a hillbilly  The call continues  This thing  Some reason  Tonight 
[00:19:00]  Is coming down  Messing  With my dogs  Trying to get towards  My back porch  But  If he goes too close to me  I'm gonna kill him  Okay  I can't answer  If you can do that or not  I don't mind him  I don't mind him  On the mountain  I know what's on the mountain

[00:20:30]  Any harm  They never use any harm  But  I thought I'd call you  And tell you  In case I have to  Make that shot  Okay  I'll call and ask you back  What to do  All right  All right  All right

[00:30:00]  Uh  Okay listen  Wow that is a big  Fucking nasty  Scary shark  Whoa  And they're right there  Guys we gotta learn  About knobby though  Bo in North Carolina  Bo  Jesus  Bo lives near the  Bigfoot guy  Oh yeah  Yeah  Same area  Drilling holes in a shark  With a fucking  With a fucking  Makita drill  What part of the shark  They can't feel that  It's the fin  It's the fin  It's like  Cartland  How do we know for sure though  I'm trying to put it  It's like a bitch  They don't feel it  It's like  Maybe you won't feel 
[00:30:30]  Maybe you won't feel this  When I bite your fucking  Leg off  Yeah they probably  Say the same thing  Don't worry  He doesn't feel it  He has no vocal cords  So the shark is like  Ah  Ah  And the shark  Turns to the other one  And goes  He doesn't feel it  It's like that fucking  They have no brain power  It's like that Metallica video  Just  Oh god  He's just fucking  Laying there  I'm here  Yeah that could fucking kill  Bo what do you got buddy  Up in  Up in Kayser area  Just over from  I live in Pocco  Which is like  Seven or eight miles 
[00:31:00]  From Kayser  Over towards the west  Of us  There's a little  Area called  Delay  I want to  Excuse me  Sunshine  And Gold Valley  And they used to have  A smaller creature  About five foot tall  They used to call  Nobby  And people going up  Through there  Would see it  Running across the road  Just moving from  One side of the road  To the other  But I've never seen it  And I've lived around  There my whole life  Well there's no Nobby  There's no Bigfoot  There's none of that shit  I don't believe  There is either  But them people up there  They will start stories  Like that to keep 
[00:31:30]  The teenage kids  Out of the woods  To leave their  Damn stills alone  Right  Oh to leave  Their stills alone  I got you  So they make up  These stories  So the kids  Don't go  That's genius  That's the start  Of a horror movie  That's genius  Then there really  Is a Nobby  That's a good one  Isn't that  That M. Night movie  M. Night Shyamalan  Which one  The shitty one  Exactly  Which one  The one where  People live in the woods  They tell them  There's monsters  The village  Oh the village 
[00:32:00]  That's right  Yeah isn't that  What they did in that  They figured out  The village  Oh that's right  It's the exact same thing  Yeah  Those weird red creatures  Whatever right  Weren't they red or something  Yeah with the coats  And the fucking skulls  And the bones  With the claws  Well Sam  Bill Burr is in studio  Everybody loves  When Bill Burr is around  We miss him  He moved to LA  What the fuck  Happened to him 
[00:32:30]  But this is one of  The rare times  That he's back  And we're talking  Politics  Of black people  Versus white people  Well of course  Anthony is our  Resident expert  In all things white  He loves white  He calls it right  And he was there  Talking about white politics  Whereas Bill Burr  Our resident black man  Was there to discuss  Black politics  In the community  Find out  Who comes out victorious  Right now  On the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony show  Holy shit  This is stupid  This is the worst  Of Opie and Anthony 
[00:33:00]  Five minutes into it  You're like  What the fuck  On the virus  Serious exam  Changing gears  Oil spill  I'm thinking you might have  A conspiracy theory on this  Although you're not doing  Conspiracy theories as much  Bill  I do  Are you trying to fade out  Of the conspiracy theories  They were driving me crazy  I just tapped  You tapped out  No I still have my theories  This is the Obama administration  That is responsible for this  The whole thing  Because one of his  He tried to appease people  By saying he was going to drill 
[00:33:30]  I like when Bush was in office  He wasn't into conspiracy theory  And now he is  Oh no  Now they're all happening  Politics  See because he had said  He was going to start drilling  And people were like  Yeah good  We need more oil  We're going to start drilling  And he said  Yeah we're going to  Look into drilling  And then he had his people  Blow up this platform  Get this leak going  So now he can say  Ah  I don't want to drill  Because he never wanted to drill  In the first place  And now he's got a reason  And the public will be like  Yeah we shouldn't drill  Okay  So he's responsible for 
[00:34:00]  The whole thing  His administration  They just swam right up  To that thing  That they had a camera on  They sent Navy SEALs  With thermite paint  And they painted the thing  And blew it up  You got a theory on this Bill?  I have a theory  I saw a thing the other day  Where this guy  This guy had 21 kids  That then produced  90 grandchildren  And I think what's coming  Out of his dick  Is worse for the environment  Than what's coming  Out of the ocean  You know 
[00:34:30]  God damn  That's an environmental disaster  Are you talking about  19 and counting?  Does your girl watch  19 and counting?  No  Or is it 18 and counting?  I know  It was in  Rolling Stone  It was some R&B singer  Of course  Who I had never heard of  Sure  Right  And he had  Dude there's another kid  In Tennessee  He's 29 years old  He has 21 kids  By 22 women  And they go  They go like  What happened  He goes  I don't know 
[00:35:00]  He goes  It just happened  It just happened  My dick fell into  Another chicken  Like two years  He had four children  He had four children  Two separate years  Oh god  Wow  So now  They're trying  Now  They're trying to  Break up his  Check for all the  Child support  Oh wow  Which is literally  Coming out to like  37 cents  Yeah  Per person  So they're dragging  Him in jail  It's like  You know  It's horrible  He produced  21 fucking kids  Who really aren't  Going to have a father  No  Who are going to 
[00:35:30]  You know  Then do what the fuck  He did  Unless they go to therapy  No this is  And learn that it's wrong  It's not going to be  Yeah it's not  It's not going to  Be changed  And you can't sterilize people  Do you even know  90 people's names  Forget about the extra 21  Like you could even  Oh  That's insane  Yeah was it  Somebody who  Is maybe from a background  That is stereotypically known  To procreate  At a ridiculous rate  I think you're kind of  In your own  You're in your own league  When you do stuff like that  Yeah  What do you 
[00:36:00]  India  India  A bunch of people over there  Have like fucking 12 kids  India  You know  I mean  We can stare it  Into the black neighborhoods  Again like you always like to  Alright  Let me do that now  By commenting on a video clip  I saw yesterday  Oh Anthony  What no no  You know what you're like  You're like me  When I was into conspiracy theory  And all I did was read shit  That supported my opinion  I already had my mind made up  And I was like  See there you go  No no no  And after a while  I realized that was a moron  But for some reason Anthony  You never had that moment of clarity  This happened 
[00:36:30]  And no one's talking about it  And it is  What happened  It is a racially based crime  What happened  The tea party  People were having a little tea party  Oh yeah that guy on the video  Yeah  They were protesting  And peacefully protesting  And a black gentleman walked up  And socked one of the guys  Right in the fucking face  Yeah and it's not being  You're right  It was on Fox of course  But it was  CNN didn't  I didn't see them touch it  Is that the one where the guy spit on him  No  Or drop the n word or something  No  That no one could even prove happened 
[00:37:00]  Of course  Of course  Of course not  Those guys would never say something  Breitbart offered  A hundred thousand dollars  To anyone that could prove  That that happened  And no one had proved  Maybe they did  Who cares  What what  All the other tea party people  Who were around  I mean  For a hundred thousand  Somebody would have  Would have  All right you called him a name  Or something  It's not like  It holds a little more weight than that  But okay  It's not like punching  Walking up to a guy you disagree with  Did you just reduce that word  To nana nana nana  Yes  I want you to go downstairs 
[00:37:30]  Let's do downstairs on the sidewalk  And just test out both those words  Start off with nana nana nana  All right  So we can complete the experiment  Okay  I'll do it in front of the fucking  Black Israelites  That do nothing but bad mouth  White people when you walk past them  All right  I'm not saying that they're right  That's good  How about I fucking drop the n-bomb on them  See what happens  But why is that video  You wouldn't  Not getting more coverage  You wouldn't  Oh I would  You wouldn't  What driving by  It's sexy  I absolutely would  Go do it tough guy  Right now  Take out  Put your pistol on the table  Go downstairs and do it  Now you're fucking throwing rules in there 
[00:38:00]  That shouldn't be in there  Jesus Christ  Oh see  What did you think the black Israelites  Is Red Dawn like a comedy  You have that in the comedy section  Of your DVD collection  Comedy  The black Israelites  Are fucking ridiculous racists  That get away with standing in Times Square  And blurting out their hate  Meanwhile if I stood on a fucking  Spacklebucket  And blurted out  Shit about black people  The cops would haul me away  Or I'd be fucking beat up first  Oh stop it 
[00:38:30]  The fucking Klan can get a permit  To go down the street  And do what they want to do  It's the same shit  You're talking about  An ignorant group  And an ignorant group  That's what you're doing  Now you're going to try to act like  You know that they can walk around  Saying all kinds of fucking racist shit  They can  How does it affect you  Why aren't they removed  From fucking the sidewalk  For inciting  The Klan  This is why  Has to get permits  That's a great point  That is a great point  Because of the  Reaction of white people  It doesn't  We look at them like  It doesn't affect us  So we don't give a shit  If we actually  If it actually  Incited a riot 
[00:39:00]  Okay  But white people are scared  Is what it is  The way the Klan can  The way the Klan can  Incite a fucking riot  If you put the Klan  In New York City  There's going to be  Fucking problems  Yeah of course  Right  Because it's easy to  Be aggressive  And go after white people  Regardless of their ideology  It's easy to do that  That's not  But you're really  Not looking at  How the position  Of people in society  Like  Do you think  The position  Of people in society  Do you think  Yes  Do you think  A king gives a fuck  When a serf  Is fucking 
[00:39:30]  Yeah  Scream  He doesn't give a shit  He doesn't give a shit  That's basically  The way it is  Oh because  We rule so much  Because when you go in  For a job interview  As a white person  90% of the time  You walk in  It's a white dude  So that guy  Doesn't really affect  What's going on  In your life  How did that come out  Of the black Israelites  And me going up to them  And dropping the N-bomb  On them  Because you're saying  That they're inciting a riot  Why don't they get  Halled up for inciting a riot  Because they never  Incite a riot  People will yell at them  There's a few people 
[00:40:00]  Do it  But they never  It's out of fear  It's out of fear  White people  Are afraid to confront them  They are fearful  Of black people  Because of  What they see  And what might happen  To them  If they drop the N-bomb  On those black Israelites  That they'd step off  Their fucking little buckets  And punch you  In the fucking face  Because most people  Equate black militants  Or people with black  Afrocentric ideology  To violent behavior  If you criticize them 
[00:40:30]  Let me ask you this  Their racist behavior  How has it affected your life?  Directly?  Yeah  What have you not been able  To do because of that?  Exactly  That's why it doesn't  Incite a riot  Because at the end of the day  He's just some dude  Who has no power  Over your life  Screaming  Now if you've got  A bunch of white  So what is me dropping  The N-bomb on him  How does that affect his life?  How does that affect his life?  Because of white people's  Fucking dominance  In the culture  Fuck that  How am I dominating that guy?  You know Opie  Wouldn't you think  That I would learn  Like I'm going to  Actually convince him  Bill  How am I dominating him 
[00:41:00]  By dropping the N-bomb?  Bill's making a good point  But you can't totally  Discount black racism either  Like you want to  Make some really good points  I'm not  I'm saying what those guys  Are saying is wrong  They shouldn't do it  But the reason why  The reason why  That they're  They don't get hauled up  For inciting a riot  Is because they don't  They don't incite a riot  But of course they don't  That's what I'm saying  But the reason they don't  They annoy me  I've yelled shit at them  Is because white people are afraid of them  I've yelled shit at them  And I've thought the same shit  That you're thinking  And it is fucked up  It's fucked up on both sides  But there's a reason why  Like I can't 
[00:41:30]  It doesn't affect my life  If this guy's standing there  Going you know  White people  They fucking smell like  Fucking baloney  You know  White devil  Yeah the white devil  They smell like wet dogs  They're animals  They're spawned from  The devil's cock  And whatever  The next day  I'm still on with my life  It's not a problem  It goes  I think it goes beyond that  White people don't like to acknowledge  A lot of times  There is a huge segment  Of the black population  That does not like white people  Or they're angry  A lot of white people  Don't like to acknowledge the fact 
[00:42:00]  That blacks are very pissed off  And what bothers me  Is the Klan  Has white and black people  Attacking them  As they should  But the black Israelites  Should they?  I think so  Yeah I think they're garbage  Okay  But you'll never see  You'll never see  Blacks confronting  The black Israelites  You just don't see that  It's like  They're allowed to say  What they want  Without the confrontation  I think it goes beyond  Beyond just not affecting the life  And a white guy  Cannot fucking say anything  About a black guy  Or white pride  Or fucking  The south 
[00:42:30]  Or the fucking  Stars and bars  Whatever the fuck  Whatever level  Of whatever  Is determined to be racist  By black people  You can't do it  Right  And because of that  Yeah but it levels off  And you also get to live  You have cops who are friends  They wave to you  As you come down the street  As you're smoking a joint  And fucking driving your Mustang  200 miles an hour  With your get me out of a ticket sticker  Hey  It balances out Anthony  You're doing alright  With your 58 hot tubs 
[00:43:00]  And fucking  I'm not saying  Come on dude  Stop it  Just stop it  You don't have to drag  The fact that I've actually  Done something with my life  And assimilate to society  Very well  And made friends  And act like a fucking human being  To other people  Please  The fact  You have to drag that out  Instead of  Come on dude  Brian Gumbel still gets pulled over  Brian Gumbel could still  At any moment  Get the shit kicked out of him  If someone doesn't watch  Good Morning Today  Or whatever the fuck he's on 
[00:43:30]  What happened  In Bill Burr's life  That made you such  A guilty white person  I'm not a guilty white person  You are so guilty  No I'm not  He's tapping out  He's tapping out  He just capitulated the argument  I'm not  Victory for Bill Burr  I am not tapping  You know what  I'm going to leave  I'm going to leave right now  Bill Burr and Caroline  You just got fucking destroyed  And you got nothing  When did you become  Such a fucking douchebag  Iron Sheik  That's not even  Don't pull an Iron Sheik  On me motherfucker  Fuck you  I fuck you and your ass  Make you humble  I don't want to do this anymore  You just  You just 
[00:44:00]  You just had an Iron Sheik  That's a new thing  The Iron Sheik moment  You tapped out  I did not tap out  You did  Why did you tap out  You stopped making points  You're the one that could  Fucking just  You lay shit on me  You stopped making points  You just started insulting me  You just did that to me  You kind of tapped out  I asked you what happened  In your life  Thank you  You kind of did  There we go  Why did you tap out Anthony  I didn't tap out  Why did you tap out  New York for the pest  Capitulate  I made you guilty  You will not  You just capitulated the argument  You did not blame black people  His eyebrows are up  Look at it  It's over  His fucking heart rate 
[00:44:30]  You won't blame black people  It's over  For any  It's over  There has to be some responsibility  But why did you insult Bill Burr  In the middle of it  Yeah why did you quit  What happened  At what point did you quit  I didn't quit Bill  You quit  I'm here  I'm right here  No you didn't  You abandoned your argument  You completely abandoned it  And you turned it into a personal attack  Put your eyebrows down  And be a god damn man  Gather yourself  Do we need to take a break  No  Maybe Anthony can 
[00:45:00]  This is too good  I did the same thing  That you did to me  Three times during this discussion  No you didn't  Yeah  Is that why Opie's agreeing with  Opie's agreeing with me  He's more agreeing against Anthony  Than he is with you  Opie is stirring the pot  What  What are you talking about  I've seen this for years  There was a white guilt thing  He said to Bill Burr  That he's a very guilty white guy  I think that Opie has a track record  That speaks for itself  That he doesn't do things right  No no  He doesn't do things like that  He doesn't do things like that  Bill  I mean  What  Bill  Bill  There you go  Oh Anthony's back 
[00:45:30]  Bill  I didn't know who that guy is  I apologize to Bill first of all  Are there any  Eyebrows and your mustache  Everything is fucking  Full mast  Full mast  Are there any situations  Are there any situations Bill  Where black people are to blame  I'll give you a great example  I'll give you a great example  I didn't even ask the question  I already know what you're asking  What am I going to ask  You did ask it  You fucking shouted it  With your eyebrows  At full attention  Is there anything  Are you  You would have thought 
[00:46:00]  You were out of food  Have you no  Answer the question  That Anthony never asked  This is one that I hate  I hate whenever  A black dude  Is like a pimp  Or something like that  And then they just blame  His social situation  And be like  Well if he was white  He could have been a doctor  It's like  No  He's making a scumbag move  How come if he was white  He wouldn't be a CEO  For Enron  He wouldn't be a banker  He wouldn't be a complete  Piece of shit 
[00:46:30]  All of a sudden  Like just because he's black  He's going to be an angel  People are people  And most people  Are pieces of shit  And they're fucking liars  That's what I feel  And most people  Don't do the right thing  Including myself  Because that's the hardest thing  In life  Is not to be a complete  Piece of shit  It is  It's easier when you're younger  When you have parents  And they can act like  They're not complete  Pieces of shit  And try to fucking  Make you a better person  But the second you leave  The nest  And then you go out  In the world  And it's like  I could go to a peep show  Right now  And I'm not going to get 
[00:47:00]  Sent to bed early  Then you slowly go off track  Which has fucking happened  In my life  So that's my thing  No I don't  I don't just openly  I don't  You know  Believe me dude  I've had unbelievable battles  Unbelievable battles  With other black comics  Who are all sitting there  In the middle of a deal  Before I'd ever gotten a deal  Telling me that I had it easier  As a white person  That is enraging  When black comics  Pull that fucking shit  Yeah  So that happened  Not to start a fucking  You know  Soapbox thing here for Anthony  Another subject to go off of 
[00:47:30]  Yeah there's definitely  My eyebrows are down  There's definitely that stuff  Okay  I've lowered my brows  Yes you have  Alright  We got two great phone calls  Coming in  First is James in Canada  James  Good morning boys  Good morning James  Anthony  Yes sir  I'm whiter than two bags of milk  And I got no guilt for nothing  But I find it funny  That you have these battles  With Bill or Patrice  But when Quentin Rampage Jackson  Or Frank Lucas was in this week  You didn't say shit  What am I going to start a racial discussion 
[00:48:00]  With them for  They're not known for that  What am I going to do  Exactly  All Frank Lucas did  Was a million dollars a day in drugs  Yes  Why would you discuss  The black community with him  Why am I going to get into it with him  And Bill Burr is known  For his racial stances  Yeah at times  At times  Yeah  I've seen Bill up on his soapbox  Alright  You have a good day  And you're a fucking Canadian  So shut up  You can't even talk about this  Oh shit  He did it again  You won sir  You're 0-2  You just did it again  You kind of did it  That is the biggest 
[00:48:30]  Bill that is the biggest cop out  Because you're not bringing up a point  What do you know you fucking Canadian  He is  Go dump some syrup on your cock  The guy  Well I made my point  You mean to tell me this guy knows  Anthony you're a child  You argue like a child  About African Americans  They're not called African Canadians  Clean up your toys  And go to your room sir  No  And think about what you've done  No  There you go  They're not called African Canadians  We're talking about African Americans  You have to live amongst them  To get an understanding  Of what we're talking about  A Canadian does not know  What the fuck  I'm talking about  He does raise a good point 
[00:49:00]  About Canadians  Commenting on racial relations  In America  When they don't experience it  It's a totally different story up there  They have a totally different point of view  They don't fucking put up  With shit up there  If a white fucking Canadian  Says something bad  Racist  Race  Wise  It's more of a crime  The Human Rights Tribunal  They really are pathetic in Canada  It's more of a crime  Than fucking yeah  Killing somebody  The fucking CBC is worse  Than the FCC  It's crazy  So I don't want to hear  From Canadians  Alright let's go down  To New Orleans  And talk to Q  Oh Christ  Might as well be Canada  Q I believe  Has been on our show  A few times  Q  Yeah I've been called  A couple of times 
[00:49:30]  What's up boy  What's up Q  What's up Q  Congratulations  That's the first thing  I want to say  Jimmy love your stuff  Thank you  Phil you're a killer man  I love you to death  Congratulations Q  I'm sure you have  Lots of kids  See  See  0 for 3 Bill Burr  Although funny  That was funny  That was funny  That was funny  That was funny  Q how many kids  Do you have  For the discussion  On hand  Hold on Q  How many kids  How many kids  I've got two  I'm 37  I have two kids  By my wife  That we've been married 
[00:50:00]  For six years  And my son is five  And three  Wow you're the guy  In all the commercials  Wow holy shit  Or maybe he's just  Been shooting blanks  For the last 15 years  But no I mean  But you know  My background  I come from a background  That I wanted to wait  And that was the way it was  Now I had a lot of friends  That you know  Grew up as such  Had a lot of different kids  And things like that  And also grew up  With a lot of racism  I grew up with a lot of racism  And everything like that  Yeah  I grew up  I grew up  Not so much in the inner city 
[00:50:30]  I grew up not so much  In the inner city  But in the suburbs  And what not  And then we moved out  To a little place  That was like  Completely country  School went from  Kindergarten to 12th grade  And I was like  One of five blacks  In the whole school  So that's when  I first encountered racism  But anyway  The whole thing  I wanted to say was  It's so funny to hear  Ant  Because a lot of times  Ant goes on his rants  And everything  And sometimes  I gotta admit  I gotta turn it off  And I almost get to the point  To where  Oh shit  I'm canceling my exam  But you know  Oh Jesus  Don't worry 
[00:51:00]  Sirius will do that  When you stop paying the bills  It's all in a day  It's all in a day  It's all in a day  It's all in a day  It's all in a day  And I really love you guys  For everything you do  And for everything else  You've gone through  And you know  And everything that you say  But  It's so funny sometimes  To hear Ant  Go on these rants like this  Because it's almost as if  To say that  White people  Are you know  White people are mad  Because we don't have  Enough power  No no  It has nothing to do  With power  It has to do with  When it boils down 
[00:51:30]  To it  Like you were saying  Like you were saying  With the black Israelites  On the corner  Now like I said  I'm not endorsing  Any particular  You know  Any particular ideology  Anything like that  As far as what everybody  Says and stuff  But  From the way you're making it sound  And just to  You know  Reinforce Bill's  You know  Bill's point  Was that you're saying  That when you pass on the corner  And these guys are just  You know  Oh white people  Blah blah blah blah blah  And everything  And it's like  Why don't more white people  Get mad  Right  And how come  It's like you get a black person  On the corner  You know  You get a white person  On the corner  Doing the same thing  Because it's a fine line 
[00:52:00]  Because unfortunately  Especially within the climate  That we live in right now  It's a very fine line  That man  Chicken get reverted  To 1965  Or you know  1955  Believe me  I don't think it's going back  To 1965  With a black president  In the white house  Oh yeah  Go on youtube  And read some of the comments  And there are comments  Under videos  That show  Horrid atrocities  Committed by black people  Oh really  Yes  I can go  I can go  No no no  Dude you can go on  Anything  Anything  And there's 
[00:52:30]  This shit that has  Nothing to do with race  And what I love  About the race  Is they can't even spell  Somebody wrote the other day  Left a comment  And he goes Mexican  I could have guessed  G-U-E-S-T  Bill actually said it right though  You said  It is the king surf mentality  But that really is  Like Ant gets like  Yelled out like  Oh he's a racist  But that king surf mentality  Really is  A very closeted racism  And a very closet  And I don't mean by you  But I mean  The people that feel that way 
[00:53:00]  Like oh the black Israelites  Shouldn't be held accountable  For what they say  They're children  They're serfs  That is the mentality  Of white people walking by  Which is a weird racism  It's a very very subtle form  Of being a real  Paternalistic racist  No  It's more like this  It's more like this  At no point  Have white people  Had to deal with  Like  Like being  The weaker culture  So that they  Were the under the thumb  Of somebody else  The same way like  Jewish people  Freak out about everything  Because of the shit  That they went through  We haven't gone through that 
[00:53:30]  So that's why  When those guys  Say that shit  It doesn't hold the weight  Because no one  Has successfully done that  Now  If somebody  Successfully  Makes white culture  Drop down  And we go through  A whole bunch of bullshit  Like that type of stuff  That goes there  Would not be tolerated  It wouldn't be tolerated  But it's kind of  The same point  Like  I understand why it happens  You're right  I mean  Blacks were dominated here  For a long time  And all up through the 60s  And even you know  Into today  The institutionalized racism  Still exists  But you can't say 
[00:54:00]  That there's  There is a double standard  In the language  That to me  Goes beyond that  It goes beyond  Just like common sense  Going hey  You know what  That's like  If you're complaining  About hey  How come they hired  A black guy  Who is equally qualified  As a white guy  That's where to me  Hiring quotas are legitimate  Like you know  If you have three black guys  And three white guys  And they're all  Equally qualified  And you hire the black guys  Because the playing field  Has been so shitty  For so long  That makes that argument  Sense to me  But when it comes to  This double standard  In the thinking  And the language  It goes beyond that 
[00:54:30]  It goes way beyond that  Especially with  The way things are now  What do you mean  A double standard  In the thinking  The language  Like white people  Hold other white people  Much more accountable  To standards in the language  Than they hold blacks  And to me  That is the way  You talk to somebody  That you feel better than  That is the way  You talk to a child  It's not the way  You talk to somebody  Who you just see  As a worker  I would agree with that  Like I don't think  The solution is  To make it easier  For someone  To get into college  Rather than having to do  The same amount of work 
[00:55:00]  You're not helping  That's like  You know  I got a couple  You know  Friends that kind of bums  And it's like  You give them money  You're not helping them  You're not helping  Because they don't learn  And then they burn  Through the shit  And if you don't  Teach them anything  You know  It's just  I definitely know  It's called being a certain  Kind of rich  Yeah  Huh  The name of it  Is being a certain  Kind of rich  They call it  No  These are white people  God damn it  Anthony  You're the worst  You really are  The fucking worst  And then he sits there  And acts like he's not a racist  On any fucking level  You really are  He's pretty much admitting 
[00:55:30]  That he's a racist now  He's pretty much admitting  That  I am an out of the closet racist  How can you so openly  Be like that  And that fucking old lady  There from the white house  Says one thing  Her career is just  Completely over  You know why  Because she was living  A fucking lie  In a facade  I am open  And honest  And so when I say something  People accept it  She wasn't living  In a facade  She was  She was a flaming liberal  She was a flaming liberal  That's what you get fired for  I'm on your side  I don't think she's a real  None of us 
[00:56:00]  So then why did you just say  She's a flaming liberal  Because she was always open  About her views  She was always open  She was always open  About being radically left  Not really about Israel  And Jews  That's a radically left view  To have though  But saying  Coming out  And just saying  Jews should be sent back  To Germany  And Poland  And the United States  From Israel  Is a little much  It's beyond left  Beyond yeah  But she always  And that's worthy  Of getting fired  After a 50 year career  No no not at all  It's fucking ridiculous  No no not at all  It's fucking ridiculous  It is  She's worse though  Because she groveled  In her apology 
[00:56:30]  She's 90  And she was like  I'm sorry  I just hope that  Those lovely people  Work it out  It's like just  She fucking attacked  Bush so hard  She's been very very open  Just say what you got to say  And don't fucking  Don't don't  Grovel after you said it  You're 89 years old  Yeah  And they asked her  What she thought  And she gave an honest opinion  She never should have  Got shit to that  There's a lot of people too  Who I've heard  Say that same thing  And it's not against  Jewish people  It's like  You fucking took them  And you dropped them  Into a goddamn hornet's nest  And then you're wondering  What the fuck's going  It's crazy  I mean  And then there's 
[00:57:00]  Oh we were here first  You were first  It's like  You're never gonna solve that  That shit is never gonna get solved  Right no  It's never gonna get solved  There's too much bad blood  So whatever  You're walking down  And she just fucking  Send them back to where they were  And then all of a sudden  It gets shown  And then she's like  The worst person ever  And I love how she was  She was in the public eye  For 50 years  And it took to the 50th fucking year  Before she finally  She's asked hard questions  For every fucking president  For 50 fucking years  I think they just wanted  To get rid of her  Get out of it  Get her out  They were done with it  Yeah  They just were looking  To get rid of this person  And it's 
[00:57:30]  I mean  You can't  It's just  I don't know  I agree  Basically in the early 60s  When she started  You could essentially  Be open racist  Openly racist  Wouldn't that shit  Have come out back then  I mean they had presidents  Who were openly anti-Semites  Everybody fucking knew it  I don't like the Jews  Yeah  And he's recording himself  Yeah  He was recording himself  Check one Jew  Check one Jew  He was the worst  Yeah Jew hater in the house  Exactly  He didn't care  That it was on tape  Yeah so I think 
[00:58:00]  That I think  It's complete bullshit  And she was only answering  Questions that she was asked  The guy said  What do you think  Should happen  And she said  This is  Like I think  That they should get out  He goes  Where should they go  And she answered  It wasn't like  She approached somebody  And just started  Spitting shit out  She was just  Answering questions  That she was asked  To me she did  Nothing wrong  I see  I see  Where I'm called  A racist a lot  Is that I don't see  This responsibility  On the part of  The black community  As a whole  It's you know 
[00:58:30]  Individually  You'll get  Some  Responsibility  And people  Taking responsibility  For their  For their actions  But for the most part  It's just like  It's like  Everyone's making  Excuses  Instead of just  Fucking living your life  And doing  What you know  Now this is the thing  I agree with  What is right  For the most part  I 100% agree with that  I 100% agree with that  But the thing is  Is you're putting that  All on one group  If travel the country  Dude  Do stand up  And you will find  That you know  That whole  Fucking 
[00:59:00]  I don't want to  Even  That Walmart  Culture of  Fucking people  White trash  It's called  Yeah those people  They're in this  This fucking  Death circle  Of stupidity  And no one can seem  To fucking get out of it  And it's like  You know  Dude I mean  You basically  Have described  Most people that I run into  That's what happened to me  I used to be conservative  Then I went fucking  Hardcore left  And now I'm back  More towards the middle  Where I really think  A lot of people  Cause their own fucking problems  And they're full of shit  And there is 
[00:59:30]  You know  The way the playing field is  It is not fair  And that type of stuff  And it's all how you react to that  If you choose to use that  As an excuse  No one gives a fuck about you  So you're not  You're not gonna get  Then no one gives a shit about me  You're not gonna get ahead  If you just keep using that  As an excuse  But on some  On another level  I can't sit there and act like  It is like  But I think the playing field is level  I think the playing field is level  Oh yeah  The Kennedys  The Burr family  It's all the same thing  Their big house down there  Martha's Vineyard  It's all the same thing  I think the playing field is level 
[01:00:00]  Between the races  We lived in a duplex  They had a compound  It's all the same thing  You know  I'm sure they paid taxes  On all their bootlegger money  Oh I doubt it  Oh no  No literal Jim  You're listening to the worst  Of the O.P. and Anthony show  On the virus  Sirius XM  Sam you're in a relationship  With a girl  That's true  A lot of people  Don't realize that  But yes  It's with a girl  A very hot girl  That's true  She is banging  I'm in a relationship  With a girl

[01:02:00]  Or go to their  Friggin website  And vote on them  And the one that won  Was some streak  Like a shaved lamb  Streaking through  A football game  From like water buffalo  And antelope and shit  And they had these  Two slack jawed cowboys  Commenting on it  And that was the one  That won  Greatest commercial  The past 10 years  You know I  I watched that show  Last night  For 30 seconds  30 seconds  Was enough  I fucking couldn't 
[01:02:30]  Change the channel  Fast enough  Yeah  We're gonna be watching  All the great  Superbowl commercials  From all the past years  Yeah  And the way the guy  Was describing them  I mean he  He couldn't have been  More of a tool  And then they'd have like  You know the eye candy  Going to like the football  Players  The comment on them  Yeah  They would all be like  Oh yeah I liked that one  And uh  And then Ray Rice  Was on there  And he'd be like  Hey diddle diddle  Ray Rice up the middle  For a touchdown  And it was just  The dumbest show ever  What did you want  To watch last night  But you were forced  To watch that 
[01:03:00]  I wanted to play PS3  There it is  He didn't want to  Watch that shit  You gotta get a second TV  My friend  Yeah well  There's nothing wrong  With  I can't play it  On the 27 inch  In the other room  I gotta play it  On the 46  So you know  My wife wants to  Sit in the living room  And watch TV  On the 46 for an hour  And I can't like  Wait till that  Shit's over fast enough  Sure  And then I get to  Play at 10  Sorry about that brother  Hey yeah  When you were married  Did you have to like  Sit down and watch  Programs that you 
[01:03:30]  Didn't want to watch  Oh  You did right  Oh yes  Nightly basis  Just sitting there  Going oh god  This show sucks  I wish I could remember  Some of the shows  But I've pretty much  Tried to block  That entire chunk  Of time out of my head  Yeah  And I'm doing a pert  Good job  Sure you are  But I do remember  Sitting there  Going like  God damn it man  I don't want to be  Watching this  And then god forbid  I got on the computer  To play like Half-Life  Yeah  What are you doing 
[01:04:00]  Oh yeah  I'm just gonna  You know  Play Half-Life  For a little bit  A little bit  Alright well  I guess I'll see you  At 3 in the morning  In case you know  I'll come and sit down  And watch  This lousy  Fucking show  With you  Just to not  Make any waves  Not have an argument  And be able to  Just sit  And fucking  Why do you  There are shows  That are made  For women  There are shows 
[01:04:30]  That are made  For men  And then  Yeah  And yeah  And there are shows  For both  Yeah  But when it comes down  To having to sit there  On the couch  Because your woman  Likes a particular show  What is that about  Making you sit there  You're not having  Like special time  Together or anything  Yeah  It's not like quality time  You're just sitting  Watching a stupid show  And the thought  That I couldn't  Just go over  Which by the way  My computer was  10 feet away  From the couch  And I could see  The TV and everything  I'm in the same room 
[01:05:00]  And everything  But just that  I don't know  I guess it's a  Power thing  With some couples  Right  Where the wife  Does not want  The husband  Doing something  Just for the fuck  Of not letting him  Do it  With no reason  To back it up  You know  I'm lucky so far  There are times  I'm like  Alright  I'm gonna go  In the other room  And you know  I'm gonna watch  Whatever  Whatever I wanna watch  And she'll do  The same thing too  I'll be watching  I'll be watching  The Islanders  She goes  You know what  I got some  I got some shows

[01:06:00]  Now I'm stuck watching  I don't even remember  What the horse shit shows  Were back then  But I was stuck watching  Two TVs  He's just joking  Nobody has two televisions  So I think  It comes down to that too  You know  Yeah  Although I think  Most people have  Two TVs in their house  At this point  Oh fuck  Come on  But it's just like  Doing anything  Like wanting to  Sit and play  A computer game  And it just turns  Into this like  Yeah you know something  What if I do  Just come staggering 
[01:06:30]  Up to bed  At three in the morning  Considering  Especially  I didn't have to  Be to work  Until three in the afternoon  So why the fuck  Wouldn't I just play  A video game  Until three in the morning  Who gives a shit  Like who would give  That big a shit  That I'm enjoying myself  That's what I'm doing  Just you know  Let me do it  Why this power play thing  Yeah what business  Is it to you  And it's had  Yeah  It's had a lingering effect 
[01:07:00]  On how I do things  When I do have  You know  Company over the house  Or something  Because sometimes  It's like you know  Yeah I'm going to go inside  I got to check some shit  In my office  On that computer  Because that's a Windows  Or I'll just  Flip open the laptop  Start playing a little poker  But I'm still sitting  On the couch  Watching TV  Whatever  And I'm thinking  In my head  Oh boy  There's going to be trouble  Oh my god  There's going to be a fight  Oh my god  Should I even grab the computer  I mean well  It's no problem  It's no fucking problem  Right  But it's been ingrained in me  Like over years

[01:16:00]  Of women  It is a matter  Of a power trip  But that for most  Of us  It's purely attention  You know  It's like Anthony  Said you could be  In the same room  With the television  In sight  Making an attempt  And still  If you  Your attention  Isn't all on us  Yes  Something  You know  It just sort of  Irks us  Like what are you doing  You know  So  Yeah  But in this day and age  Women should have  Their own lives  This isn't  This isn't  The turn of the century  I mean there's a lot 
[01:16:30]  Of shit going on  For women now  I remember  And it was  It was  98 I believe  1998  I remember  The ex  And  And her mother  We were all  Going to the movies  Together  And it was  It was a  Ridiculous chick flick  And I got there  And finally  Like stood up  For myself  And said  I cannot  See this movie  I'm the only one  That remembers 
[01:17:00]  This  I know  This Anthony  Yeah yeah  I'm literally  The only one  I don't think  Anyone is connected  To that old Anthony  Except for me  No  Maybe a couple  More people  I think  I think  They went  To go see  How did  You stand up  For yourself  I think  They were  Walking in  To go see  How Stella  Got her groove  Back  Oh shit  Oh god  And I was  Just kind of  Like  And I was  Gonna go  Like  But then  I'm pissed  The whole time  In the car  The whole thing  I'm just like  No  No  So we get there

[02:52:30]  Because he had his baby  But  Bill Schultz  And Andy Levy  Were in studio  From TV's Red Eye  Along with  Ant  And  Jim Norton  Talking about how terrible television was  In the 1970's  Now it's basically because  They only had four channels back then  But some of these shows  That I guess you could consider iconic  If you watch them by today's standards  It's total crap  Well you didn't have much of a choice back then  But what's fun is  Going back  Revisiting  And seeing how these TV shows stand  In today's standards 
[02:53:00]  Quincy and terrible shows from the 70's  On the Opie and Anthony show  This is the worst  Opie and Anthony  I would like to smoke  Your cock  The virus  Sirius XM  I've been  I've been partaking  And watching a little Quincy  And who brought up the fact  That it's like this  Very powerful music  And they've got to have the goofy  Because it's Jack Klug  Was that Danny?  Somebody broke it up  Might have been you  Everybody just knew  He was a funny guy  Bill Burr I think  It could have been Burr  Yeah  But I've been watching  Some Quincy episodes 
[02:53:30]  And how this show  Was on the air  And people watched it  And took it seriously  Is beyond me  As a girl  She was smoking  Contaminated grass  Was that one of them?  Oh yeah  Talking about grass  And man  And just  He tried to take down  A magazine  Like High Times Magazine  Only  It was called  Far Out Magazine  And there was  A head in it  Yeah  The kids are calling it  Far Out  And there was 
[02:54:00]  Some kind of  An ad in there  For this chemical  That made plants  Grow really big  And kids were using it  To make their pot  Grow big  But it would  Kill some of the kids  That were using it  And he's like  If one more child  Dies  I'm going to that  And he went to the magazine  And talked to the editor  Who was one of these  I don't need to be  Hassled  By the man  And meanwhile  We're just always laughing  At how  He's the coroner  He's supposed to be  Sawing someone's head open  And weighing a brain 
[02:54:30]  Not out doing  What detectives  Are supposed to be doing  Coroners are never  Caught in a web of intrigue  No  There's never car chases  With the coroner  He's never questioning people  Yeah but we do that  Like with CSI  Yeah yeah  Same thing  What the fuck  Are those people doing  They're supposed to be  In the lab  Or at the crime scene  They're not supposed to be  Going to  Suspects  Chasing people  When I watch things like  First 48  Or cold case files  Things like that  You'll see the detective  Will get a lead  On who the suspect is 
[02:55:00]  And then they call  The cops  They call officers  Or the SWAT team  Or whoever  Has to go in  Depending on what  This guy did  And get him out  They're not there  Knocking on the car  David Caruso  With his gun out  No they're like  Hey I need some detectives  I'm a patrolman  To back this shit up  There's no reason  For anyone in bones  To be in a car  Yes  They don't even get  To deal with the flesh  They're just  It's all like  Yes  And Quincy  Quincy is out there  Just investigating 
[02:55:30]  Crump  He went over  One of the girls  That died from  Smoking grass  And he goes over  The house  And was like  Do you mind  If I look in a  Bedroom  For like clues  And he's looking  For  Please the coroner  And he's going  Through her music  Boxes  And  Taking her panties  Yes  Let me smell these  I need to know  If she had a yeast infection  And he finds pictures of her  Frederica Bimmel  Is she a big fat person 
[02:56:00]  I'm going to write big fat  There's a moth in my hair  I was watching the very first episode of Quincy  Oh the first one  The pilot  Yeah he actually travels to Mexico  On his own dime  For an investigation  Because he was  He had to go figure out  Who the murderer was  So there was some connection  You gotta go  To where the jazz cigarettes  Are first made  Sam I don't touch them  I just like to look at them  They're so small  I go to Mexico  And photograph them 
[02:56:30]  Book me a flight to Thailand  He brought his live-in girlfriend  With him to Mexico  And then they get into  A car accident  Where like the car goes over  Like the cliff  Like that cliff  And then he leaves her there  And flies back to the United States  To finish the big investigation  He left her in Mexico  In a Mexican hospital  Well she said it was okay  So  He was only interested  She's dead  That's really my expertise  She was sold into slavery  Yes  It's in my chest of drawers  Chest of drawers  You know he tried to expense it too 
[02:57:00]  He tried to expense it  They were like  What the fuck were you doing in Mexico  Quincy  What are you doing  Yeah  The gruff lieutenant guy  Monaghan  Yeah  Yeah it was lieutenant Monaghan  Was that a lieutenant  That ain't quince  We can't do it  We're too busy  Yeah  You do it  Because if another child dies  It's on your head  How does this bill from Club Med  Have anything to do with the child dying  It was a family Club Med  I was investigating  It was apparently chlorine poisoning  From the pool 
[02:57:30]  Yeah  And margarita poisoning  Quincy  The guy was shot in the head  No coroners out there investigating  But you know what  I remember it was on in my house  When I was growing up all the time  Definitely  And people would talk about it  Like wow  Do you see Quincy?  What?  It's about an ugly 55 year old coroner  How shitty would it be  To like live in a time  Where the water cooler talk was 
[02:58:00]  Quincy  Quincy  Yeah  Did you catch the Quincy last night?  And then Sam came in  And helped Quincy  And he opened the refrigerator  You thought it was going to take out  Some kind of a human organ  And it was a Sam  And they thought it was an amoeba  But it was only Sam's genitals  And his jet black pubic hair  I forgot about Sam  Sam and Quilcy  Quilcy?  What show was that?  That was a girl  That was the leather Tuscadero of Quincy  And shows like that 
[02:58:30]  And Canon was another one  Big fat  Canon  And I remember the coolest thing  Canon had a phone in his car  And it was a phone like you would have in your house at the time  With a coiled wire  That went to this big box  And I thought it was so cool  Because he'd like pick it up  And it would be like  Mobile operator  Mobile operator  Get me 555-3821  And they'd have to go through like this  Special mobile operator  But he was driving the convertible  And talking on the phone  And it was like 
[02:59:00]  Wow, the fucking  Be at the point in history  Where you could do that  That is fucking  And then a cop pulled him over  What are you doing?  You're not supposed to be on that thing  You know  In 40 years  You'll fat fuck if he did by then  I was so  Canon  A Quinn Martin production  Epilogue  Yeah, they'd have like chapters  Like it was a big drama  This was the theme song to Canon?  Canon  And what could Canon do?  He weighed  William Conrad 
[02:59:30]  William Conrad  He was giant  Sweating constantly  And they did show him a couple of times  Trying to pursue people  And he would catch them  You'd see him get out of his car and run  They'd go around a corner  And then the next scene  He's got them on the table  It's like  How the fuck did he catch that guy?  There's a 21 year old black man  He just wades from around the counter  And just sort of falls on him  Like a timber type movie  That's why every year at the Emmys  They'd say  And the winner for best editing is 
[03:00:00]  Canon  There it is  Canon  Oh, there's the Quincy cast  Mannix  I prefer the Quincy gang  Wait  Who's the other one on the left?  Who's that guy?  Looks like Quincy's son  Who's that guy?  There's Quincy?  Sam?  His boss?  I bet that's a gruff reporter  That was always after the story  That Quincy had  That Quincy  I can't tell you now  I'm embroiled in an investigation  If only I was as tenacious as Quincy was  Yes  If only I was willing to use my own money 
[03:00:30]  My room is messy  Wait  Wrong show  Yeah  I grew up on those shows  And at the time  They, I guess, were the shit, you know?  Yeah  Your parents would sit there  And just be glued to this stuff  Like it was fantastic  Mannix  This is what happens  When you would only have four channels  Like, stuff like Quincy would be  That God forbid you changed it too quickly  Yeah  You gotta break it  Invent the remote 
[03:01:00]  What the fuck you want from me?  Yeah, you couldn't go from like  Channel 2 to Channel 11  Right  You'd be quick  Or you'd get yelled at  Yep  But for some reason  You had to really fast  You're gonna turn that knob  Right off the TV  Yeah  Hey, you're right  I did  Did you do all the time?  Every TV  You always end up having to use the pliers  To change it  That little white thing  That stuck out  You'd have to maneuver  And then you'd have to actually tune  Like  Yeah  You'd have to fine tune  Your television  I definitely remember that  It was fucking ridiculous 
[03:01:30]  Just trying to watch quality television  You never had a clear picture  Of anything  It was always kind of  Jimmy, nice one  It was always kind of  The sound would never be good enough  To pick that up  Or the ghosting you'd get  Or the ghosting you'd get  From another channel  Yeah  Like if you're watching  ABC here in New York  You'd get the Connecticut  Channel 8  Would always ghost in on you  So you're watching Quincy  And some fucking  Like Channel 8 show  A cooking show  Is on 
[03:02:00]  And it would be like  A white ghost  With wavy lines  Cooking over Quincy  Yeah  Someone's cooking food  There's a meatball  In my colon  Every time I go  Into these breaks  People go  You're old  I had a Sony  Trinitron  I had a Zenith  We all trusted  Walter Cronkite  Yes we did  What time is Dana calling  Did anyone know  I don't know  It was supposed to be like  Oh 945 
[03:02:30]  Oh I thought it was 915  Oh silly me  We'll keep an eye out  For him  I started that  I apologize  We'll keep an eye out  For him  He paddled after  A Japanese show  Really  What was  Frank Canna Quincy  Was a Canadian show  Before it was  I have no idea  Let me hear  Hey Don from Nevada  Hey guys  How you doing  Hello Don  You have some  Quincy information  My god  No back then  There was a  Coroner in LA  He was a Japanese guy 
[03:03:00]  I can't remember  Ken Noguchi  Quincy  That was before  Thomas Noguchi  I'm sorry  He was getting really  In the way  In investigations  I remember him  Catching shit  All the time  By the  The cops  And the government  People  For getting involved  In investigations  Oh really  Can I ask why  Nobody's impressed  That I knew the name  Of a Japanese  Coroner in LA  You're a very good actor  Jim 
[03:03:30]  And you do that  You go like  Oh I know who it was  You'll know I'm wrong  If I go Thomas  Noguchi  Look that up  Is that right  Just look up  You'll never get  Noguchi  And he would get  Involved with  Investigations  And I guess  Piss people off  So Quincy  That's what happens  In real life  When a corner  Gets involved  Just pisses the cops  Always run  And annoying  Suspandating crime  Scenes you idiot  You don't have  Your booties on  OJ's running loose  Because of you  Is that him 
[03:04:00]  He almost looks  Like Quincy  Thomas Noguchi  Looks like Quincy  Squinting  Because he can't  See his page  In front of him  He's a face  Like Quincy  And a cock  And balls  Like Sam  Boo on both counts  Good job Quincy  We gotta let  This murderer go  Because you  Questioned him  Illegally  Yeah  Very good  Thanks again  That's 22 this month  Guess what  Quincy  Another child  Did just die  Because of you  That's it  All the defense  Attorney would  Have to do  Is  Was a coroner
