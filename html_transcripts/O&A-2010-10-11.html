<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts, Anthony Cumia and Greg Opie, apologizing for a delayed start with characteristic profanity and banter.  They then launched into a discussion about Columbus Day,  derisively referencing indigenous populations as "savages" while debating the historical significance of Columbus's voyages.  This segued into a discussion on the physical characteristics of different ethnic groups and the influence of environmental factors, punctuated by offensive generalizations and profanity.  The conversation shifted to a scathing critique of a New York Islanders hockey game at Nassau Coliseum, focusing on overpriced and poorly maintained parking, a lackluster presentation,  and the replacement of familiar concessions with Capital One branding. Opie detailed his negative experience, highlighting poor pre-game video and audio synchronization issues during the game.

Next, they reviewed an episode of *Conspiracy with Jesse Ventura*, specifically focusing on the Plum Island germ warfare conspiracy theory.  They found humor in the episode's content and Ventura's presentation, continuing their use of profanity and references to conspiracy theories.  The discussion then turned to Rich Vos's Comedy Central special,  its editing process, and the removal of certain jokes. Vos, present in studio, shared a personal anecdote about a recent sexual encounter with his wife, including details about kissing (or lack thereof).  Further commentary on the *Conspiracy with Jesse Ventura* show and a visit to Strawberry Fields concluded this segment.

The next segment delved into Rich Vos's anxieties about the paternity of his three daughters, stemming from a general distrust of women.  He used crass humor to exaggerate potential future scenarios involving drugs and sex, ultimately stating his love for his daughters regardless of paternity. The conversation shifted to his use of a V-harness golf training aid, leading to more off-color jokes.  The arrest of comedian Ralphie May for marijuana possession in Guam followed, with humorous anecdotes about May's interactions with drug-sniffing dogs.  This led to a discussion about the ingredients in processed meats, sparked by Vos's consumption of turkey bacon,  including a graphic description of a video showing hot dog production. The segment concluded with discussions about the popularity of 10/10/10 for weddings, a listener complaint about the online stream inexplicably switching to the Ron and Fez show, and Vos's frustration with the show's "babysitters,"  culminating in a humorous email exchange about scheduling a proctologist segment. Vos ended by promoting his upcoming stand-up shows.

The following segment focused on technical problems with the online stream, repeatedly switching to the Ron and Fez show for extended periods.  The hosts expressed their frustration and disdain towards the Sirius XM technicians,  referencing listener emails and tweets confirming the issue's widespread nature.  The second topic involved censorship concerns surrounding a planned comedic bit featuring a prostate exam by Dr. Steve, whose lack of a New York State medical license raised legal concerns.  This was contrasted with previously aired, more outrageous bits from their terrestrial radio days, highlighting the perceived restrictive nature of their current employment.  They also discussed past bits like the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Rich Vos showed a rough cut of his documentary about female comedians, leading to playful bickering.  The discussion included Rick Sanchez's apology for anti-Semitic remarks, and Dr. Steve called in briefly to discuss the prostate exam bit and his licensing plans.  The segment concluded with brainstorming alternative versions of the prostate exam bit to address the licensing issue.

The final segment covered the firing of CNN commentator Rick Sanchez following his controversial comments. Opie, Anthony, and Rich Voss discussed Sanchez's apology and the ensuing media firestorm, with Sanchez himself calling into the show.  The conversation covered Sanchez's comments about Jews controlling the media, his justifications (exhaustion, needing to get to his daughter's softball game), and Voss's argument about hypocritical criticism.  The discussion expanded to include stereotypes about various ethnic groups, the role of banks in financing movies, and minority representation in television.  Sanchez's in-studio appearance involved unconvincing excuses, mocked by the hosts and Voss. The latter half featured the "Jacktober" prank call segment, revealing several radio stations using the same pre-recorded calls.  A call from Sanchez's girlfriend, Bonnie, interrupted the segment.  The show concluded with further discussion of the prank calls and a brief mention of upcoming events.  The entire broadcast was rife with profanity and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We see Anthony on satellite radio.  Our host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie.  We and Anthony apologizing for yet another launch.  We comment profanity like a rat.  Is this the last straw for the Rocky Radio Bureau?  Yee-haw! Yeah! Come on, bring it on.  You know what? I think this is hilarious.  A whole big bunch of fun.  The greatest show on satellite radio today.  This show is like the box of chocolates that Forrest's mother was talking about. 
[00:00:30]  You're a no-good son of a bitch.  Bob, you motherfucker.  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  What's going on?  I do what I'm told.  Completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on, it's shocking.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do this.  But enough of this fucking palaver.  Hi, everybody. 
[00:01:00]  We've got to hurry up and do this radio show.  I've got a hockey game to go to.  Oh, shit.  And you've got a parade to avoid, so we should jump right in and start this shit.  Yes, exactly.  What is it, Columbus Day today?  Yes, the day that everybody comes out and bashes good old Christopher Columbus  for being a murderous Itrallian coming over here to the United States.  Well, what it was before then, just some land, and discovering it, even though there were engines here. 
[00:01:30]  How many engines do you think were in America?  Who knows?  What would your guess be?  Who knows?  You can't tell by anything they built or did, so fuck them.  That's what I say.  I've always said that.  So how did he get away with discovering America if people were already here?  Because we didn't think engines were, like, a full human?  No, because they couldn't build tall ships that could get across the ocean.  They didn't have, like, cool weaponry and things like that.  And they were, as they called them back then, savages. 
[00:02:00]  Savages but not human beings.  Right.  It was kind of like, ah, they look like people.  But I don't see any, you know, I don't see any buildings.  I don't see any modern shit that humans make.  Did you buy that Columbus story when you were growing up?  Or did you question it when you saw, like, the big ships in the harbor or whatever  and you saw the engines on the land doing what they'd been doing for many, many years  before Columbus and his people came here? 
[00:02:30]  They brought cornucopias.  But did you buy into the fact they discovered America?  Yes.  You did.  I still do.  I was like, what is this horse shit?  You can't discover something that other people have already discovered.  Discover is a gray area with this situation.  But I will say he claimed it, you know, for Queen Isabella.  He claimed it for the smart people.  And, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He claimed it.  And then once you claim something.  It's yours.  It's yours. 
[00:03:00]  Especially back then.  No one knew what they were doing.  Well, I just claimed your computer.  Hand it over.  Ah, no, see, I have this and I can defend it.  Yeah, you can.  So that is a different, that's, therein lies the difference.  Yeah, you can.  As a matter of fact, I'll take your computer.  I can almost defend myself.  Right, sitting Opie.  Wow, look at this.  We're having a little history lesson right here.  I'm the engine and you're the fucking Columbus fucking meatballs. 
[00:03:30]  Meatballs.  Uh, yeah, I don't know, you know.  But that doesn't mean that you discovered it because you're more powerful, you've got  weaponry and they just have bows and arrows.  I think if you go somewhere and bump into a big chunk of land that no one knew was there.  Right.  You discovered it.  But people were there.  Yeah, they were there.  But, you know, the word didn't get back.  When Columbus came back, it was like, holy shit, I found this place.  Right. 
[00:04:00]  And, and it was a discovery.  For, you know.  For that world.  Yeah, for the old world.  But not the world that was already sitting nice.  No, they pretty much had dibs.  You think there's some engine out there?  Well, he's long dead now, obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  That actually discovered America and gets no credit for it.  Yeah, I think.  Who was that engine?  I think from the facial features and whatnot, I do believe in one of the theories that the  Indians, the American Indians, did come down from the north.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:04:30]  From maybe even Russia over the Bering Straits, which was connected.  Eskimos.  And then, yes.  And then down where they adapted to the hotter climate and became what we know as American  Indians.  Well, explain this then.  How did we get rid of the flat-faced Eskimo look?  Well, Indians sometimes do have that same facial feature.  Not so much, though.  Not so much.  So what were they breeding with to kind of change their look?  Over time. 
[00:05:00]  Over time.  Over time.  Nature adapts.  Under the blue skies.  We adapt.  Now, if you look at an Eskimo, he is set up physically for cold weather.  Ooh.  You know, the small, like proboscis.  Be careful, Jimmy the Greek.  No, no.  I'm just saying.  See, what you got is the Eskimo with the small nostrils.  You're retaining body heat by not having anything that's sticking out too far and pumping blood 
[00:05:30]  into an area that wind can whisk over and steal body heat away.  So, hence, the smaller features and the smaller eyes because the reflection of the snow and  the sun.  Wait, you're trying to tell me.  Hold on, hold on.  You're trying to tell me the Eskimos have squinty eyes because they had to squint a lot  and then nature eventually just said, you know what?  Instead of squinting a lot, we'll just make your eyes that way.  Very bright up there.  That's fucked up.  Very bright with the sun.  That's fucked up.  It is fucked up.  You think it's as easy as that? 
[00:06:00]  Uh, yeah.  Yeah?  And then when they came down here, they adapted to a certain warmer lifestyle.  Do people in Iceland have really big eyes?  No, but if you notice people in Iceland, because again, it's cold there.  Right.  They do kind of have kind of a, look at Bajork.  Bajork, sure.  Bajork has squinty eyes.  Well, because she came from somewhere else?  Some kind of Nordic thing.  Like, the people do have kind of thinner eyes.  They're not Asian.  So there's a lot of glare up in Iceland, too? 
[00:06:30]  I've never been.  I don't know.  Anywhere you go up north, it's, you know, a certain place.  You get kind of, you know.  Where's there less glare where you got the big eye people?  Big eye people?  You look at places like Ecuador.  Danny's writing that.  I know all that, Danny.  We're just having a radio show.  It's called Natural Selection.  Go back to school if you want to know the real shit.  Danny's watched a lot of Discovery Channel.  I see that.  Where are the big eyed people?  The big eyed people are in Africa. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  If you notice Africa, you get a lot of big eyes.  Right.  South America.  Right.  You get some big eye people because...  They don't have a lot of sun there.  A lot of vegetation.  A lot of jungle.  You're under a canopy of rainforest.  So you don't have to squint as much.  So you don't have to squint as much.  And you need your eyes wide open.  Right.  Because there are a lot of predators around.  Ah.  So you got to be constantly on guard.  Whoa.  Whoa.  This is the best lesson I've ever had in my life. 
[00:07:30]  It's just amazing.  I like this way better than going to school to learn this shit.  I buy into this theory.  I do.  Absolutely.  And then the American Indians, they came by and they slowly lost some of those facial characteristics  characteristics of the Eskimo and the Russian, Siberian Russians.  Right.  And became American Indians after finding some warmer climates and adapted to America.  Nice.  Just in time to be completely slaughtered. 
[00:08:00]  So someone else could discover America.  Right.  And fuck it up.  The real big schnazzola of Chris Columbus.  You're an Italian, right?  That's right.  You good with this?  I'm fine with it.  I love Chris Columbus.  He's our hero.  Came over in big boats.  Big boats that were just amazing.  What it must have looked like to the American Indian looking out.  Could you imagine?  And seeing giant ships just going, what the fuck is that? 
[00:08:30]  We don't even have a wheel.  They didn't have a wheel?  No.  They'd have those travoys.  Those stupid travoys.  Those two sticks with the leather in between and they would pull shit.  Wouldn't that get just stuck in the dirt all the time?  Yeah.  They'd put it on the back of a horse.  Why couldn't they figure it out?  Just make round things that roll.  Why couldn't the people that came before us figure out the wheel way before they did?  That's why they're not in charge anymore.  All you had to do was see a rock roll down a hill or something and go, wow, why don't we imitate that? 
[00:09:00]  Ding.  Ding.  The light bulb goes off over your head.  But for many, many years, they just watched rocks rolling down the hill going, wow.  Meanwhile, over there in certain parts of Europe, oh, my God, wheels like crazy on the carts to cart away the dead.  The black man invented all this stuff.  Well, the stoplight.  I know the black man invented the stoplight.  Where's Earl?  He'll tell you all the black inventions.  Or at least, you know, some kind of filament.  Of course he invented the stoplight.  See?  I'm with you today. 
[00:09:30]  See?  All right.  Enough said.  Stop already.  So it's Columbus Day, and we got a parade route that we got to get on the other side of.  Yes.  What time is that parade today?  Fifth, 11 o'clock.  They shut down all the shit.  I know the coverage starts at noon with, know who they got this year?  Who they got?  Joe Piscopo.  Ooh.  Joe Piscopo will be doing parade coverage.  You think?  Oh, who's the Grand Marshal? 
[00:10:00]  Grand Marshal?  Like, who's that?  He's like the big muckety-muck.  Is it usually a politician, or is it like a celebrity?  Yeah, it's a celebrity, usually.  And then they wave.  So I guess some of the Soprano people have done it over the years, or no?  Oh, yeah?  Well, that's probably a bad image.  You know how they are.  They get a little like, ah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Fuck, who cares?  We all make fun of everybody.  Just relax.  No.  Calm down.  Relax and enjoy.  Who's the Grand Marshal?  Let's see.  Does anybody know?  I don't know.  Should be me.  Snooki. 
[00:10:30]  Shut up.  Stupid Snooki.  It's not Snooki.  Once again, I was watching Jersey Shore last night.  She's a Grand Marshmallow.  I know this is an ADD.  No?  I know this is an ADD show.  I was watching the Jersey Shore last night.  I don't know why this show is popular.  I don't either.  Are we officially too old for this shit?  Why are people watching Jersey Shore?  I ask this question once a week.  It's sort of the freak show thing.  They just hang out in a house.  I don't care.  Like, when you watch The Real World, they were actually doing shit in the house.  This house, they just hang out and do nothing and wait for T-shirt time. 
[00:11:00]  Then they'd sing a song, it's T-shirt time.  And then they'd go out and party.  And that footage isn't even good because it's so loud in the club, they have to have subtitles  on the screen.  And then they show, like, the situation spreading his fucking herp or whatever the fuck he has  to many different girls.  And then someone brings a girl back to the house.  That's the whole show.  Like, what is this show about?  Yeah.  There's no, um, no one cares.  I don't care about them. 
[00:11:30]  Like, I don't give a flying fuck.  Not that I cared about the real world people, but their stories were kind of compelling.  They were interesting characters.  They had back stories.  They believed in something.  They argued their point.  These people are...  Very one-dimensional, just kind of fucking, all right, look, you got this fucking idiot.  Right.  And this is his gimmick.  Right.  And then you got Snooki, and she's the drunk idiot.  Right.  But none of them have anything else.  They don't go in-depth into any of the other parts of them.  And I understand when the show first hit, you know, it's different. 
[00:12:00]  So people like watching, but they're still watching.  Yeah.  The numbers for this show are ridiculous.  That's huge.  And I just sit there and watch and go, why?  Why?  I don't get it.  Why?  I don't get it.  In the end.  Maria Bartiromo is the Grand Marshal of the Columbus Day Parade.  Who?  You might know her as the money honey, as she was known years ago.  On Wall Street, right.  Before she became a little long in the tooth and a little married.  Right.  But back when we were at NEW...  I think Danny's a fan, though, because she wore the glasses. 
[00:12:30]  Right, Danny?  She's got the glasses look you like?  No, no.  Maria Bartiromo isn't the glasses chick.  Sure she was.  Wasn't she?  No.  No.  No.  No.  She was...  Which one?  When...  Oh, you're right.  When Gary Wall was our PD.  What do you mean she's long in the tooth now?  Well, she's not as hot as she used to be when they called her the money honey.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She got married and shit.  She's not bad.  I'm not saying she's bad, but...  What is she now?  Money not so honey?  Money, meh.  Men's and men's. 
[00:13:00]  That's her nowadays?  Is it her now?  I don't know.  What's the date on that fucking thing?  I don't know how long...  No, I don't think that's...  Close.  She still looks good.  I mean, she's all right looking.  Right.  She's probably got a big, nasty Italian bush, though, I bet.  Big, fucking, black, thick, hairy...  Are the Italians still growing the bush hair?  Italian hair.  No, they could shave it, but by the time they go out...  Like, they could shave it when they're ready to go out, but by the time they hit the sack,  after the date and everything, it's Fred Flintstone mouth. 
[00:13:30]  Right down there.  She's definitely got that.  Right down there where the naughtiness happens.  Italian chicks just really have a little trouble keeping that hair in line.  Yeah, what do you want to do?  And to me.  Well, you guys are part black.  That's why.  Ah, you know, the Moors.  The Moors came.  When the Moops came over.  Well, that's good.  So we got the Columbus Day Parade.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm going to the Islander-Ranger game today out there on Long Island, Anthony. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  And it segues into my little rant that I have about the New York Islanders, a team I followed  since I was just a little nugget.  You're a bandwagon jumper with that team, I think.  I sure am, man.  I sure am.  This is the first year you're really paying attention, I think.  Well, I need another week to even know who the fuck's on the team, first of all.  The whole team changed again.  Yeah.  But I drive up to the NASA Coliseum.  It's the big home opener.  The big home opener for my team. 
[00:14:30]  We've all been to home openers, right?  Oh, home opener, yes.  Home opener?  Yes.  When the Yankees have a home opener, it's like pomp and circumstance.  What's the other word?  It's huge.  Circumcision.  Circumcision?  No, pomp and circumstance.  Yes.  Where they really...  Ladies and gentlemen, you're 2011 New York Yankees.  Oh, it's just a giant thing.  I mean, Yankees are a great franchise, even though I'm not a fan.  But you could even think of the lesser teams in every sports league, right? 
[00:15:00]  The Gophers?  The what?  You got tickets for the Gophers?  Are you kidding?  So I drive up to NASA Coliseum for the big home opener.  And the first thing I noticed as I was driving into the parking lot, I've been paying $7 for  parking for the last few years.  So I hand my $20.  Yeah.  I can afford it.  I understand.  But I'm talking for everybody else.  The common man.  The common man, sure.  Right.  And they hand me $10 back.  Go, hey, hey, hey, bub. 
[00:15:30]  So the first thing I noticed, they just decided to raise parking about what would that percentage  be?  About 40%.  Oh, shit.  Don't make us figure out percentage.  All right.  But it goes from $7 to $10.  Yeah.  And I was telling you before the show, usually when people decide they want more of your  money, they decide they want to rip you off.  Yeah.  They actually put a fresh coat of paint on it to make it look like they did something.  Some new lines in the parking lot.  Yeah, my point being, if you're going to raise parking by $3 and rip off people even more, 
[00:16:00]  maybe you should make it look good.  Maybe you pave the fucking parking lot.  Repave it.  Maybe, like you just said, you put new lines in so you can figure out where the fuck you  can park in the lot instead of making up your own parking spot because no one has given  a shit about this parking lot for years.  Maybe you sweep the whole fucking thing so you don't get a flat tire from the bolts and  the nails that happen to be in the parking lot from years of whatever the fuck happens  in there.  Fill in a couple potholes.  No.  You now have paid $10 for the same shitty parking. 
[00:16:30]  Same shit.  Right?  Yeah.  Shouldn't you fucking dress it up a little bit?  You'd think they'd do that just so you can't really bitch and complain.  Right.  Then I walk into just what I have to say is the worst presentation in the, it has to  be in the NHL anyway.  It's got to literally be.  I go to Ranger games because I live in Manhattan so I get to go to Madison Square Garden a few  times a year.  Excitement.  I got the in-laws down in Philly so I get to check out a couple flyer games every year 
[00:17:00]  and because they're right over there I go to the Devils too.  So I go to four different arenas every hockey season.  This place is such a shithole.  I'm starting to look up now and wonder if these rafters are going to fall down on us during  one of these games.  You know what the scoreboard did once?  It fell down, yeah.  During the offseason or something.  No one was in the place but the whole fucking scoreboard did fall.  So I'm looking up going when the fuck are the rafters going to start falling in this shithole? 
[00:17:30]  And they refused to build a new arena out there.  They've done nothing to it.  Nothing since I was a kid.  Yeah.  I remember the first time I saw Charlie Daniels there and they have not done one thing.  Right.  And yeah, you walk in, you feel like you're going to a minor league hockey game compared  to these other places I get to go.  Where it's modernized, excitement.  The second you walk in to the garden for a ranger game, isn't it exciting?  Yes, it is.  It's like, wow, this is fucking awesome.  Look, it kills me to say it.  Yes, it is.  Yeah.  Same thing with the flyers. 
[00:18:00]  You go in and the lights, there's just lights and lasers.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,  bright lights.  Yeah.  They changed their bulbs.  Crazy.  The lighting at Nassar Coliseum is even shitty.  Yeah.  And I'm like, okay, so you can't get a new arena, I get it, but how about you dress  up the product?  The team itself is a good, I have no problems with the team, the coaches, none of that shit.  But slap a coat of paint on the walls.  Slap a coat of paint on the walls.  Roger Luce, who we know very well from our BAB days, he still does a great job calling 
[00:18:30]  the game for the people inside.  Absolutely.  I'm not trashing him, but I'm pretty much trashing everybody else.  The bra that took Jill Nicolini's place years ago, Jill Nicolini used to be the girl that  would work the crowd.  Yeah.  And she was great.  Oh, I thought you meant the Canadian girl.  The one that took Jill Nicolini's place.  Oh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Get it?  Well, then get her to the fucking Coliseum.  Because she would do a better job than the bra they got.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Who just looks haggard for her age.  Shit.  Doesn't have the skills to be on mic or on camera.  No.  Has a shitty, like, teeth smile after she talks.  Dude, that looks painful.  So then I walk into the Coliseum, and I usually, one of the things I do is I get a Starbucks  coffee, you know, especially, I don't know, I don't drink, you know, I don't drink that  much.  I'll have a few beers throughout the year, but nothing crazy.  But I'll have a cup of coffee, right?  My Starbucks coffee was replaced by Capital One Coffee.  Well, people do know how good banks make coffee. 
[00:19:30]  And the theme is Capital One, I guess, bought the concessions or bought, I don't know what  they bought, but it's Capital One everywhere, which is just shitty, shitty white containers  on everything with their shitty Capital One logo.  Capital One.  They have the worst fucking logo.  So now my...  Their motto is, what's in your wallet?  Can we please have it?  Yeah, exactly.  So now my Starbucks coffee, which is a little nice, and the logo's nice, you feel like you're 
[00:20:00]  drinking a nice cup of coffee, is now Capital One Coffee in a shitty white fucking cup, no  better than any crappy deli coffee you would get.  And then my brother, who went with his son, he gets, his thing is he gets a big thing of  popcorn to start the game, right?  Nice big, you know, thing of popcorn.  Now the popcorn is half the size in a shitty white box with the Capital One logo.  Now it's Capital One popcorn.  There you go.  You're getting your sponsorship out there. 
[00:20:30]  It is just...  It's the corporations taking over, man!  Man!  Why doesn't Jesse Ventura investigate that whole thing?  The New World Order corporations taking over our popcorn.  I got stuck watching that, too.  Not stuck.  It's the best thing ever.  It's gotta be the best show.  Did you watch the first season?  Because they gave us a free copy.  No, I did not. 
[00:21:00]  Of the first show of the next season?  Dude, it's a scream.  Wait, should I watch the first season or the second season?  Second season's coming up, I guess.  Oh, you mean you watched...  The middle of October.  Oh, they gave us a disc of the whole first season.  No, no.  They gave us a disc of the first show of the second season.  Which you watched.  Which I just watched over the weekend.  Yeah.  It just had me roaring.  Especially after watching that parody of the guy doing...  The wrestling thing?  Yeah, on the wrestling.  Yeah, we got so much to do today.  It's just...  What was the first episode about?  It was about... 
[00:21:30]  I was laughing so hard at the whole thing.  Oh, it was...  No, I...  You know something I completely forgot?  It was...  Because I also watched one about 2012.  Which I think was from last year.  Right.  Oh, this one was about Plum Island.  Plum Island.  Plum Island.  Plum Island, right off of the coast of Long Island.  And are they using it for experimentation on animals and human beings?  And I'm watching it. 
[00:22:00]  What the fuck is this?  He goes...  And then the best part.  We're taking a boat out to Plum Island.  I was a governor.  I was a Navy SEAL.  I should be allowed access.  And then Coast Guard, like, a little Zodiac starts following them.  Yeah.  There's the Coast Guard.  They sure don't want us there.  It's like, it's a fucking installation that no one's allowed in.  Of course.  They're turning us back.  They're turning you back because they don't want the rest of your hair to fall out, governor. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, they're saving you.  You know how contaminated that island is at this point?  And then they had the...  Remember the Long Island, the Montauk Monster?  Oh, yeah.  That was in the news.  And it turned out to be like a fucking...  Giant squid or something?  It was a raccoon.  Oh, that thing.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Or a turtle without its shell.  They had some guy who amounted to nothing more than a blogger.  Okay.  Nothing more than a blogger, a conspiracy blogger.  Sure.  And he was like, Governor, all these animals have been washing up on shore. 
[00:23:00]  And they come from Plum Island.  There's irrefutable evidence, people.  I think we knocked the lid off this one.  Oh, my God.  And it was just proven to be something else.  I think my brother's a marine biologist.  Didn't he explain to us what it was?  Yeah, yeah.  What was it?  I forgot.  There was an actual explanation for the...  What was it called?  The Montauk Monster.  The Montauk Monster that washed ashore.  And it was either a dog that was in the water too long or a raccoon or... 
[00:23:30]  When things end up in the water...  Oh, they're saying it was a raccoon, Danny?  A raccoon.  Yeah, when it ends up in the water and the fur comes off and then it gets sunburned and shit...  Right.  It's just a fucking raccoon.  Look, there it is on the internet, Jeff.  Yeah.  Well, you buy the government's line that it's a raccoon.  Go ahead.  I was a Navy SEAL.  And I've never seen anything like that when I was treading water.  Looks like you were practicing your Jesse Ventura over the weekend. 
[00:24:00]  It was all I was doing.  Yeah.  My girly over the house there.  Yeah.  She could not deal...  All I was doing all weekend was conspiracy stuff.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, we got to go to the Apple store.  I've never seen an Apple in the place.  I want to talk to Steve Jobs about this Apple store.  Hi, I'm Jesse, the governor.  Can I get in the stock room?  No.  They won't even let an ex-governor in the stock room to prove there are no apples in this... 
[00:24:30]  Right, Jesse.  It didn't matter.  Everything became a conspiracy.  So what is he saying about Plum Island?  We all know it's a fucking...  That it's a place that is specifically made to create things for germ warfare.  It has nothing to do with anthrax and hoof and mouth, and they're trying to find cures for animal diseases.  These are all animal disease things that aren't transferred to people. 
[00:25:00]  It's a very secure island.  That's why they didn't let Jesse on the fucking thing.  It is a creepy island, though.  That's where we had to turn around.  At one point, he goes, yep, we're being shadowed by the Coast Guard.  And they had to use a telephoto fucking lens, and you could barely see this little raft, the Coast Guard raft.  Right.  It could have been anywhere.  That's funny.  There I was.  They won't let me on the facility.  Of course they won't. 
[00:25:30]  It's a secure island.  Plus, they're trying to work.  Yeah, let them work.  Let the poor fuckers just work, Jesse.  Just trying to work.  And then he gets in the boardroom with his people.  Right.  I want you to talk to this guy in New York who claims he knows an employee that saw everything.  Who are the people, though?  They're bloggers.  Just other whack jobs.  One guy was Internet Reporter, they called him.  Oh, really?  Internet Reporter.  You know what that is?  Big copy paste, copy paste. 
[00:26:00]  Right now, I'm going to 10 o'clock and I can't handle it.  Apparently, Opie and Anthony are dicks from an Internet Reporter is reporting this.  Opie and Anthony are dicks.  And how do you respond to charges?  The show was a lot funnier on any W.  I'm reading a website here from an Internet Reporter.  Oh, Jesus.  Might as well, right?  It's exactly it.  Same shit.  Come on. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, that's great.  Now I've got to watch Conspiracy with Jesse Ventura.  Why did they tell Hannibal Lecter he could stay there on Plum Island?  He's a fucking ass.  It was so goddamn funny to watch, though.  Do we have another copy in the office?  I don't think they actually gave me one.  Because now I've got to watch.  Yeah, all the dramatic moves he does and the dramatic camera work, we were laughing that  there's no fucking way the staff and the people that edit it and put together the clips and 
[00:27:00]  come up with the stock footage aren't roaring laughing at Jesse, directly laughing at him as  he's got his arms crossed and they're doing that circular camera move around him as he's  looking up at the sky like, oh, I'll get to the bottom of this.  No, you won't.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, there he is with his arms folded.  His first season was successful because they gave him a second season.  Do you know, apparently there's a giant shelter underneath the Denver airport for political 
[00:27:30]  people and rich people for 2012?  That's what he's saying.  Oh, it's here.  And then as he's driving out of the Denver airport, they see these pipes, these square  pipes, and they slow-mo it.  And he goes, there they are.  No mistaking that those are going to be tunnels.  Because apparently there's tunnels from NORAD, Cheyenne Mountain Complex in NORAD, to the 
[00:28:00]  shelter under the Denver airport.  Well, maybe they're just...  Irrefutable proof, Opie.  Maybe it's like Disney World where they got...  Don't give me your poppycock.  Maybe they got an underworld city or something because the airport's so big.  Like, they need space for shit.  How about the fact that a lot of times you've got to kind of take a tunnel from the terminal  to baggage?  Right.  You know, and whatever it is.  Of course.  And there's trains and why, if the airport is already built, why are they still excavating?  They're still excavating and digging. 
[00:28:30]  Well, maybe they're building something else near there.  Yeah, that's the government's line.  He's going to ruin it for all you real conspiracy theory people out there.  Oh, it's great.  He's going to ruin it for everybody.  It is great.  Hey, just to finish up.  So, oh, you did that because of the Capital One poppycock?  Yeah, yeah, Capital One.  Yeah, of course.  Just two more.  It always goes back around.  Just really quick.  So then, you know, this is the home opener for the Islanders and their produced piece was 
[00:29:00]  some weird fucking, like, almost hair metal-y song that I never heard of with highlights  like, this is the year for the Islanders.  And it's supposed to get the crowd pumped and no one's pumped.  They're like, what the hell?  What is this horseshit?  Who fucking put this together?  Hofstra College?  Oh, yeah, right.  It's right down the road.  I mean, somebody that they decided they didn't want to put a lot of money into the big production  piece that started the season. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Then they haul out, like, a square and a rectangle where the players are going to come out.  Uh-huh.  I'm like, what the fuck is that?  It kind of looked like speakers.  No, it was, like, extra video, extra video screens.  Are you kidding me?  You know how everyone else in the fucking sports world are coming up with these massive, you  know, video screens?  They're giant screens, and they're all around the perimeter of the place, so you know how  the way you're sitting, you can see it.  This was just to kind of try to enhance the presentation as the players came out with some lame-ass 
[00:30:00]  leftover from a Charlie Daniels concert smoke machine in the background.  It's sad.  And then finally, you know, they're doing a lot of video presentations, you know, up on  the Jumbotron, whatever the fuck they call theirs, right?  And the audio's out of sync.  It's opening night!  It stinks!  It's the home opener!  My brother goes, the fucking audio is out of sync. 
[00:30:30]  I'm like, ah, they'll probably fix...  I'm trying to be, like, the...  Yeah, yeah, the, uh...  The optimist.  I'm like, oh, they'll probably fix that.  It's probably just a little...  They didn't realize it's just...  I go, it's just a setting.  It's pretty...  That's pretty easy to fix.  The entire game, the audio was off by at least a second, a second and a half.  It's your home opener, assholes!  They stink.  And then my brother looks around and goes,  I don't even think they sold out the home opener.  How do you not sell out the home opener?  Because no one wants to go to that shithole. 
[00:31:00]  I go, maybe, you know, the security lines are, you know, long and, you know, that happens a lot, you know?  Sure enough, like, late in the first period, these seats were still empty.  I'm like, holy shit, they didn't even sell out the home opener.  There's thousands of people that aren't here.  Yeah, I was saying, I went to the range yesterday, and it was right about when the Islander game was starting, when I left.  And I looked, and I said, I go, I think there's an Islander game tonight.  Like, the lot wasn't full. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  The parking lot wasn't full, so I thought, oh, maybe there's something, some small fucking minor league bullshit going on in there.  No, it was the Islanders.  Yeah.  No one went.  Hey, man.  You know, I could, if you want to hire me, I could easily turn that shit around for you.  I could easily turn around the presentation.  Turn around.  The whole presentation, I could turn that around in a second for you, but it's going to cost you.  Tell Wang I'm ready.  Hey, Wang.  Give me a fucking call, and I'll consult you fuckers and teach you a thing or two.  Or how about you do this? 
[00:32:00]  Go to any other NHL game in the league and see what the fuck they're doing.  Take a look around.  There's excitement in between plays and stuff.  And then finally, I don't know if this is a new thing everywhere, but when a goal is scored or there's a big hit on the ice, you want to see the replay.  So everybody, you're trained to look up.  Right.  Go, okay, they're going to show the replay.  They didn't show any replays, and every time you looked up, it was a commercial.  Is that what they're doing now?  Wow.  Because they know they got your attention, because you're used to, if you go to a lot of sporting events, you look right up when something just happened because you want to see the replay. 
[00:32:30]  Next thing you know, it's some lame-ass fucking commercial for some lame-ass shit I'll never fucking buy or anybody else in the place.  And they must be like, all right, your commercial placement, it's right after a goal.  Right.  Everyone's going to be looking at it.  Everyone's going to look up.  That's probably how they're selling it.  You're right.  They charged them a fuckload of money for that one.  Oh, brother.  They didn't show any of the big hits.  They didn't show the fights.  They didn't show any of the goals on the replay. 
[00:33:00]  So then I'm talking to my brother.  Maybe the fucking replay thing is busted and not ready for the season.  Oh, my God.  Dude, being a long-time Islander fan, I am so fucking disappointed.  That stinks.  I mean, it's one thing to not have a new arena, but you could jazz up your presentation no matter what it is.  No matter what it is.  Like you said, just go to another fucking arena.  Look around and go, all right, that's nice.  That's exciting.  That looks fun.  And ready for this?  Puddle of AIDS, you're absolutely right.  He does a sports blog.  It's pretty good. 
[00:33:30]  We promote it every once in a while.  An expert in sports.  He does a sports blog.  He writes, ha, ha, ha, ha, your Islanders have a college radio station as their Islanders radio network.  It's true.  Is that at Hofstra?  It's true.  It's true.  Is it Hofstra?  It's true.  A college radio station is doing the radio fucking play-by-play.  That's beautiful.  That place is just right.  Or it's being broadcast on a college radio station.  There's something weird.  They couldn't get a real fucking radio station.  Oh, that'll carry the games?  To carry the games.  So it's on a college radio station or something. 
[00:34:00]  Sad.  Real sad.  And I'm going there today for the big Ranger game, which is embarrassing because now I'll  sit there and there'll be more Ranger fans at the game than Islander fans.  Yep.  That's what it's come down to.  Just fucking move the team at this point.  Yeah.  Would it even be like, I think people are hanging on to nostalgia.  Well, then there was an interview because, you know, this may be too local, but there's  something called the Lighthouse Project.  But there's some politician in the way out there on Long Island that she doesn't want to get  this done for whatever reason. 
[00:34:30]  I don't pay attention to politics too closely because I think they're all full of shit.  Carolyn McCarthy.  But one of them is in the way of this project.  So then they had another fucking political dummy that they interviewed before the game.  And they did that interview before the game to get everyone pumped.  And of course, the audio was out of sync and saying, we're talking to Charles Wang and  we're doing everything we can to make sure this team stays in Nassau County after 2015. 
[00:35:00]  Like the big dramatic, like, wow.  You could hear crickets.  The whole arena's like, yeah, whatever.  We've been hearing this for fucking years.  And we're here even though we think the rafters might fall on us at any moment.  Was he really like thinking he was going to get the big buildup and he'd have to start  talking louder because we are going to end up.  People would be like going crazy.  And it was nothing.  Nothingness.  It was absolute nothingness.  Oh.  You know, there's hope maybe we can move this fucking team to Queens or something. 
[00:35:30]  And we're going to destroy Lincoln.  All right.  Is it all right or?  I think, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, it was that type of shit.  Look, it's not easy coming up here.  Shit.  Wow.  They got to do something.  It's just disappointing.  I mean, the presentation is disappointing, you know.  Aren't they thinking about, yeah, putting it next to City Field or something? 
[00:36:00]  They're also thinking of going to Kansas City.  No offense to that guy you're reading on Pal Talk.  It's just Kurt Love.  He's a dick.  They've been saying this horse shit for years.  Yes.  For fucking years.  Put it near City Field.  Years.  Yeah.  But instead, you get the parking going up and you get the Capital One logo on everything.  With your delicious Capital One coffee.  And the delicious cold popcorn because they have to get it nice in the Capital One fucking boxes.  In the tiny little boxes.  Because it's more important to make sure everyone knows where the popcorn came from than actually making the popcorn tasty. 
[00:36:30]  Yes.  Cold fucking popcorn because they got to pack them in the Capital One fucking boxes.  Remember when you got popcorn, like there's the popcorn machine.  And you get a nice warm bag of popcorn.  Right there.  Not anymore because you got to shove it in the Capital One popcorn box.  God.  That's pretty bad.  Unbelievable.  Eh, shit.  What else is going on?  You want to take a break before we get into the other shit?  Yeah, I was, uh, took a little, uh, I did a Louie festival. 
[00:37:00]  Because, uh, Netflix, by the way, they listen to Anthony.  And they got the Louie on the Netflix.  They listen to me bitch and complain that I tried to go to Amazon and it was a big confusing mess.  And then finally, uh, I get home and Netflix has, uh, Louie season one available for streaming.  Good for you.  Right there.  So I did, uh, all 13 episodes, watched them.  I'd seen some.  I missed some.  And, um, fucking show's brilliant.  It was great.  There wasn't one bad episode.  Did you see the, uh, episode where the high school kid threatens to beat him up? 
[00:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  That, that, that should win an award.  That was so fucking good.  That show should win.  If he's, I know you, uh, you know what, you, you, you, you, you put one of your shows into the, into the till to see if it can win an award.  That's the one they gotta be, uh, putting in there.  That kid was good, man.  He was the typical douchebag that would do something like that.  Hey, what are you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, for the people that didn't see that episode, uh, Louie's on a date.  They're in some kind of diner or some kind of place late at night. 
[00:38:00]  And having a nice little conversation with us to date.  Right.  And these, uh, drunken high school kids come in with their varsity jackets.  All rambunctious and loud.  And one of them comes up to Louie and basically fucking threatens them.  Yeah.  Cause Louie told him, he's like, Hey, could you guys keep it down?  Right.  Right.  Cause they were having a good conversation.  Right.  And then the guy comes over and his knuckles are all busted up cause he had belted someone  else in the face a couple of days before and just lays the law down to Louie.  Like, you know, I could just, how about I beat the shit out of you right now?  Right.  He goes, well, you know, why don't you tell me that you don't want me to beat the shit 
[00:38:30]  out of you?  And Louie's basically.  He's like, all right, could you not beat the shit out of me?  No, I didn't think.  No, that wasn't good enough.  Right.  You didn't mean it.  Right.  Right in front of his girl.  He's trying to impress.  He emasculated him.  Emasculated him.  Oh, fuck.  That was great.  Yeah.  And then the girl's not into Louie as much anymore.  I know.  It's like just something.  And then Louie.  I don't know.  And then Louie's pissed off.  So then fucking just follows the kid all the way home to, I think, Staten Island.  Yeah.  Cause there was ferries and subways involved. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Right up to the guy's front door.  Then knocks on the door and then has this conversation with the father outside as they're smoking a cigarette.  Yeah.  It's an amazing, an amazing episode.  Yeah.  Cause the father grabbed the kid and just starts smacking him in the face.  And Louie's like, hey, hey, this is why he's like this.  Right.  What the fuck are you doing?  Right.  But yeah, then they had just a conversation sitting out on the stoop, smoking cigarettes and shit.  Unbelievable.  Louie's really fucking good at playing Louie.  Right.  I mean, it's like his facial expressions are great. 
[00:39:30]  His standup is hysterical when they go to the standup clips.  It's just a fucking solid show.  But the guy has confidence too.  Cause he puts this thing together.  He's a great director.  He does everything.  He does everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he knows exactly what he wants to do with his show.  And to have the freedom to do that, no one gets that.  And he's not listening to many people from the outside.  You can tell.  No, he does what he does.  You can tell.  Cause it takes balls to do that episode we just described where he just fought.  Most of the episode is him just following him.  Following a guy.  Trying to figure out what he wants to do to this guy.  Yeah.  I know.  Like, should I just kill him? 
[00:40:00]  It could be anything from you thinking, wow, is Louie going to, you know, kill this kid?  Stab him?  Yeah.  And blindside him with a punch.  Right.  Or something.  But no.  And you, the viewers, you're just sitting there waiting to see how this is going to  end.  Yeah.  And you're totally into it right to the end when they have that conversation on the stoop.  Yeah.  It's a fucking great show, man.  Unbelievable.  Cool.  And Jimmy was on TV this weekend.  I couldn't stay up for that.  I got to watch that one.  He had a good part.  He fucking just shows his ass, though.  I'm bored to death. 
[00:40:30]  His fucking ass just, yeah, is bored to death, yeah.  His ass is just completely hanging out as he's fighting with somebody.  Right.  He had a good part, though.  He had, like, a meaty part, a lot of lines.  Yeah.  I can't wait to check it out.  Yeah.  So.  Let's eat sandwiches.  Yeah, we'll eat.  Then we'll get into this 10-10-10 thing, because it's just amazing.  A lot of people got married, because it was 10-10-10.  Oh, it's all over the news.  We got that and other things.  Also, I hung out at Strawberry Fields. 
[00:41:00]  Did you?  Or Strawberry Field.  I don't know what they call it.  Yeah.  Which is across the street from the Dakota, of course, where Lennon was shot and killed.  You kidding?  And everybody was out there, all the freaks of.  Yeah.  Was that Lennon guy that always fucking, he puts the little round glasses on and plays  Lennon songs on an acoustic guitar there?  They had a fucking hate that guy.  They had a bunch of guys there around the Imagine logo.  I think they were sitting in a hippie circle or something playing Beatles songs, because  I couldn't even get close to that, because I went there to check it. 
[00:41:30]  I love that type of shit.  I love people watching.  Oh, yeah.  And it was just a weird fucking afternoon.  Weird vibe over there.  A strange vibe.  Can I tell you the one thing with the documentary lady real fast?  Yeah, yeah.  Because there's not much to say there.  There's just a lot of fucking hippies out there.  Impromptu, like marching bands going up and down, playing Beatles songs.  But there was some documentary being filmed by, I don't know, some foreigners, I guess.  And they were talking to this typical New Yorker, and I was filming her, and then I'm 
[00:42:00]  like, wow, she has nothing to say.  So I turned off my HD flip, and right when I turned it off, she said the most ridiculous  thing ever.  And it starts by this.  When someone gets a camera shoved in their face or a microphone, they feel like, holy  shit, I got to be an expert right now.  My opinion matters.  So they're just babbling shit they don't even believe, but they think this is what the  camera wants, or in this case, the documentary wants.  She goes, this is such a special place. 
[00:42:30]  Now, she's in between the Dakota and Strawberry Field, where the famous Imagine thing is that  everyone has seen at this point, right?  She goes, this is such a special place.  You got good versus evil.  And the guy's like, what do you mean by that?  She goes, well, right there at the Dakota is where evil lies, meaning that's where Lennon  was shot and killed, right?  That is an evil...  I think they cleaned it up and put the guy in jail.  I don't think evil lies there anymore.  Thank you.  Plus the fact Yoko still lives in the evil building.  She never left the evil building.  Maybe she has a point there then. 
[00:43:00]  But she goes, that's where evil is?  And then she goes, hey, right behind, right behind...  Her voice is getting all excited.  Oh, yeah.  Right behind me is Strawberry Field, where there's peace and love.  Good versus evil right here.  And then she goes, I feel so much safer in Strawberry Field than I do in front of the  Dakota.  And I'm sitting there like, what a stupid bitch you are.  All right, dummy.  Yeah.  Why don't you go to Strawberry Field when it gets dark out?  Because you feel like it's a safe place.  Yeah, there you go.  As someone is lurking in the darkness to knock a hippie over the head and take their wallet. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Go to Rape Field.  It's called Rape Field every other day of the week.  But you don't feel as safe in front of the Dakota, where it's all lit up.  Yeah, lit up.  It's a building.  Oh, really?  There's doormen.  There's, you know...  Yeah.  But she was pontificating about good versus evil right there in this spot.  Dummy.  I'm like, fuck, why am I not filming right now?  But that's it about that, I guess. 
[00:44:00]  That's it about that.  Oh, you know what?  And we've got to play the Jesse Ventura wrestling thing later, too.  Ah, yes.  Jesse Ventura.  Jesse Ventura.  I saw it before, and then Joe DeRosa brought it to our attention as well.  It's so goddamn funny, man.  It's a parody on the Jesse Ventura conspiracy show, obviously, where he's going.  He's got all his old wrestling friends.  Yeah, yeah, a couple of wrestlers in there.  To help him with his conspiracies.  The whole thing is based on the fact that Jesse goes in to see if wrestling is fake.  Right.  It's really funny. 
[00:44:30]  You think the audio's worth playing on the show?  I'm not sure.  It is visual, because the guy does such a good Jesse Ventura.  When he's talking to someone, and they do the reaction shot, his lip is quivering.  He's shaking.  It's really good.  For now, you can just link it somewhere.  We'll tweet it or something to the people.  But he talks to the ultimate warrior.  It's great, yeah.  The ultimate warrior.  He's moving.  It's great.  Got an update also on what the hell is that after the break.  We've got to get people for the what the hell is that bit. 
[00:45:00]  Yes.  So we'll talk about that as well.  Lots to do today.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus, the Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  We've got Rich Voss in studio today. 
[00:45:30]  Certainly do.  Bananas Comedy Club.  Hasbro Heights, New Jersey.  One show Friday.  This Friday?  Yeah.  This Friday.  And then two shows Saturday.  BananasComedyClub.com for your tickets to see Rich Voss.  That can.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What's up with you, Rich?  Anything going on in your world?  I had, we watched my Comedy Central, the Comedy Central special last night.  Thank you, everybody that tuned in.  Yeah, it was you, Mike DiStefano, Norton.  And Bobby Kelly.  Bob Kelly. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Sounds like a great lineup for a nice Comedy Central special.  Yeah, it was cool.  It was shot pretty cool the way the look, you know, it was like just a cool look.  A couple bits of mine they took out.  I'm upset, but I'm also...  Why would they take him out?  I don't know, but the good thing is I could do them now on another special or whatever.  But you were telling me those are some solid bits.  Yeah, those are some really good ones.  That gets a real good reaction.  They took it out of the special line.  Yeah, but see, here's the thing.  If you're doing a comedy addiction type combo for Comedy Central, everyone knows it's a bunch 
[00:46:30]  of guys that have had addiction problems and now they're talking about it and making  it funny.  You should leave all the shit in there.  I think it has to do with timing and commercials and, you know...  Oh, so you don't think they chopped it because the material was too edgy?  Oh, no, it definitely wasn't because the material was too edgy.  Oh, then what the fuck?  They got to do what they got to do.  It was because of editing, you know...  I understand that.  I don't understand when they take out the best bits because they feel like it's too edgy.  Oh, no, because, you know, I mean, Mike had some edgy stuff.  We all did. 
[00:47:00]  It was uncensored.  They played it at 1 a.m.  Sure.  You know, and I never blame the network.  It's the editors.  You know, people in the network aren't sitting over top of it.  It's just some editors in an editing booth going, oh, this is what I think is...  You know, it's like with our movie.  Is there a point to this or we're just going to babble about it for 15 minutes?  Well, I'm going to leave it...  Are we going somewhere with this?  Yes, we are.  All right, let's go.  Listen, fucking professional stallers.  What are you fucking talking about?  Your whole fucking show is a stall.  All right, hold on. 
[00:47:30]  We're going to go to our 86 caller.  Go fuck yourselves.  All right, I'm telling the story with a lesion.  I know.  Really?  You haven't said anything here in five years.  That means anything.  So after the special...  That's your fucking point.  Let's go.  It's Columbus Day.  We had sex, my wife and I, last night.  Ah, how did that work out?  It was good because...  First time in how long?  Two weeks, I think.  Really?  Is that like your schedule now?  Two weeks?  Yeah, I count the rubbers before I leave town. 
[00:48:00]  I know exactly.  I bet he does.  I'm sure he does.  I had six before I left.  I had six when I got back.  If she was cheating on you...  Three Viagra pills.  But if she was cheating on you, wouldn't she just get her own fucking rubbers?  No, you never.  Sometimes they slip up, man.  That's how you catch people.  Just slip up.  Watch the law and order.  The shower fucking nozzles always turn all the way to the right.  You know, I can tell the shampoo bottles are facing a certain way before I leave.  Wow, really?  You fucking set it up.  Yeah, man.  Do you go in search of pubic hair ever? 
[00:48:30]  I've done that before.  But they all taste the same.  You never know.  So how did it work out?  It was good sex because I didn't have to kiss her.  We just did it.  Why don't you want to kiss your wife?  It's like fucking a hooker.  It is.  You don't kiss him, right?  Why don't you want to kiss your wife?  There was a car door in my room and she opened it and spit out of it.  Toss a 20 at her when you're done.  Yes.  It was funny.  You don't like kissing your wife anymore?  It's all right, but it's not like you used to.  When I used to pick her up at the airport when I first met her, and I used to pick her up, 
[00:49:00]  she'd come in from L.A.  We'd sit in the car and make out.  Yeah.  You don't make out.  Like, what the?  Who?  Who does that now?  Do you make out with your wife?  Make out?  Make out, make out, yeah.  Really?  Not as much as when we first met.  I understand what you're saying, but it's still cool when we do.  So that's the key.  You said it's not as much.  And you've only been married a year or so, right?  Almost two.  Almost two.  Been together six.  All right.  So we've been married over five years. 
[00:49:30]  So if you're at almost after two, by five, you'll be where I'm at.  I'm not fucking kissing her.  I'm not making out of that.  What the fuck?  But, all right.  So maybe I, why not, why though?  Why?  Yeah.  Why don't you want to kiss her anymore?  Five years into your marriage.  One, it's a time killer.  Two, if it doesn't lead to sex, what's the sense?  You don't see the point in it.  It doesn't give you like any kind of pleasure.  So it's like, why bother?  Does she have bad breath or something?  No, she's a good kisser and everything. 
[00:50:00]  But then it gets all fucking, you know, it's too emotional.  It's too, you know.  Oh, you don't like emotions.  I forgot.  You don't like being emotional.  Who wants to get all emotionally connected with their wife?  Because you know it's not going to, you know.  Because when the end of it all happens.  But that's the one person you should still be emotional with.  I know you don't like anyone touching you and all that shit or discussing emotions.  But at least maybe with your wife.  Yeah, no, because the only people in life that really can't hurt you are your kids. 
[00:50:30]  And you can make out with them.  Yeah, I know.  You really think your kids aren't going to hurt you?  Huh?  What are you, nuts?  You're going to be the only parent that doesn't have kids that hurt them?  How are they going to hurt you?  As long as they don't sleep with black people, how could they really hurt you?  Ah, that's pretty much the one.  That's the one.  That's the biggie.  That's the one.  Come on.  Your daughters have never hurt you?  Not, maybe unintentionally.  But you've never been hurt by something they've done or said? 
[00:51:00]  Not yet.  And they're kind of reaching that age where they're past that, where they could really  fuck you up.  Their teenage years were pretty good.  The only time my one daughter stayed out all night and lied.  Oh, boy.  That's basic shit.  Everybody's done that.  Basic shit, right?  You know, so what can they do?  They're not doing, you know, drugs.  They're not, you know.  Then you know it.  They, you know.  My parents thought I wasn't doing drugs during those years, too.  No, because my kids have asthma.  So they're not really...  Okay, well, I'll give you asthma.  So he knows that.  I know they're not running around sucking dick, you know. 
[00:51:30]  They can't breathe.  They can't breathe.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  If there's an inhaler with cum around the fucking thing, then there's a problem.  So if you have a daughter with asthma, that's a blessing.  What are you kidding me?  I made sure I smoked in the car.  Right.  You can't keep that shit going for a while.  You can't really smoke the pot, right?  You can't.  They can't be blowing guys.  You're not doing...  You're not smoking freebies.  They really can't do lines, because you've got to keep breathing. 
[00:52:00]  You can't smoke cigarettes.  They're just a bunch of alcoholic prudes.  I always thought asthma was a bad thing.  Now I'm thinking it's a good thing to have.  Do you see any kind of, like, addictive personalities in them, like you have?  My middle daughter.  My middle daughter.  In what way?  She's like me, very superficial.  Very superficial.  Like, I started buying them, like...  Like, when they were young, they wanted Louis Vuitton pocketbooks, and I bought them fake  ones, but they look real, real.  Yeah.  You know, and they were, like, you know, young.  The knockoffs. 
[00:52:30]  I started buying them, like, true religion jeans, because I would swear, and I realized  these are kids, you know, in $200-something jeans, and now that's my middle daughter.  That's all she wants is nice stuff, you know?  Mm-hmm.  She wants, you know, she wants my car, you know?  She just wants nice stuff, you know?  Yeah, but I mean, like, you don't see any problems in the future with her being addicted?  No, that's...  And an addictive personality?  No, that's why I question whether they're mine, but they usually say that's every other 
[00:53:00]  generation, I think.  Oh, really?  I don't know, I think so, or I'm making that up.  That's skip generation?  Wait a minute.  Or that's baldness, I'm sorry.  We can't let them get past that, though.  What?  You know, you think your newer daughter, Ray Lynn.  Yeah.  It's Ray...  Did you call her Ray Lynn?  Ray Lynn?  That's a callback, sorry.  No, uh...  It's Rayna Lynn, though.  Rayna Lynn.  Yeah.  Close enough.  But we don't call her Rayna Lynn, we call her Rayna.  Rayna, I'm sorry, right. 
[00:53:30]  That's like someone coming up to me, hey, Richard, Ira.  Right.  Oh, really?  Is it Richard, Ira?  You question if she's your daughter.  Everybody does.  But now you're starting...  Well, not you, because your kid, you both have blonde hair, so if your kid had, like,  black curly hair, then you would question it.  You're insane, though.  Your daughter...  I mean, I know we've done this a million times, but it's going to lead to the second  part of this.  You're insane, because your daughter looks like you.  The one you have with Bonnie.  You're the one who says that.  No one say...  No one else says that.  And the eyes...  She looks like Bonnie. 
[00:54:00]  You could see the Bonnie, too.  Oh, obviously.  But this is my point.  So you question if she's your daughter, but I never knew you'd question if your older  daughters are yours as well.  Oh, all of them.  I don't trust...  Why?  Because, one, I don't trust women.  One...  Okay.  You can't trust them.  I don't care how close they are, how nice you can't trust them.  So all three of your kids, you question if they're actually yours.  Yeah, well, yeah, now I'm used to my 20 and 19-year-olds, so...  But there's still a slight...  So even if they're not... 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I mean, I've already...  But I've already, you know, invested in nothing.  But there's a slight doubt in your head that they're not yours?  Of course.  Why don't you ever have a...  That's not of course.  I don't think that's the average thought of a guy.  I think it is.  No way.  Why don't you ever do a DNA?  Oh, I'm doing it with the baby for the movie.  Oh, are you?  Oh, yeah.  It's part of the movie.  Oh, God, please.  I would love that.  He doesn't...  He says for the movie, but...  No, it is.  He figured out a way to get it done.  Look, Barney, we'll do it for the movie. 
[00:55:00]  You know, I know it's my kid, but this would be fun for the movie.  No, you really need this done so you can sleep at night.  But I keep putting it off.  She goes, you want to film it?  I go, no, let's wait.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, where does that come from?  It's your daughter.  That is Rich Voss being the, I'll just be honest, many years being the guy you were  with not being very trustworthy with girls.  Yeah, it's a person of my mom.  And things like that.  And you carry that over with, you know, not trusting girls. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  I just said that.  Because you were kind of a scumbag that would fuck anything that moves and hookers and  Jim's fucking getting head while you're tagging her in the ass or the other way around.  And because you see women in a different light.  Well, that's all because of growing up as a kid.  That's all growing up as a kid.  Yeah.  You know, when like I talked about this before, when you're, you know, your mom drops you  off on the doorstep and says, I don't want him.  It's abandonment.  I don't want him.  You take him.  Oh, thanks. 
[00:56:00]  Thanks.  That's good.  That's a self-esteem booster for a seven-year-old.  And the doorstep was Auschwitz.  I know.  Jesus.  Right to the Nazi stuff.  I know.  My God.  Terrible.  Well, we could dream, can't we?  Whoa, tagging his horrible joke.  I don't know if it was horrible.  It might be horrible for you, sir.  I don't know.  It's just every, you know, you, I don't know.  Why would Bonnie stay with you? 
[00:56:30]  Huh?  Why would Bonnie stay with you?  She would, she would stay with you, have a kid with another guy and then continue to  be married to you.  That's insane.  That's insanity.  Well, sometimes.  I'm not saying Bonnie, I'm not saying Bonnie, but couldn't say you were with a girl in  life.  It happens.  Yes, I get it.  And by, you know, they, they have, you know, a quick affair or get raped and, you know.  All right.  Listen, how many, how many of your daughters you, you, you have no doubt in your mind are  yours out of the three?  No doubt. 
[00:57:00]  No doubt.  Definitely your kid.  And, and, and what are the ages of your kids before you answer this?  20 and the other one turned 19.  So 20, 19 and, and the young one is about three?  Three.  Three.  Wow.  Wow.  That was a quick three years.  Yeah, I know.  You know a little too much.  Go ahead.  Oh, look at this.  See, look at that.  Wipe that cum off your chin.  So, but you, see, I don't think you have any doubt whatsoever because.  I understand this is something that some guys go through, but. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, I imagine.  But you got three daughters.  I love them to death.  Out of the three.  They're the best kids.  How many, no doubt, they're yours?  You've been living with the one for 20 years.  You don't pick up, see that she does some of the same shit you do?  Well, they picked that shit up from living with you.  You think it's just all environmental or you think some of that shit's in the DNA?  Oh, wow.  This is getting deep.  I would go with environmental.  DNA, I would go.  It's both.  You think so?  Absolutely.  So out of the.  Well, when my daughters start cruising rest areas, then I'll know it's in the DNA. 
[00:58:00]  If one gets diagnosed with sickle cell.  Yeah.  Really?  There's a peek of balloon following her.  Answer my question.  Out of the three.  All of them.  They're all mine.  Yeah, see?  They're all, you know.  And you know what?  Just say they were.  Let's even say some crazy thing.  None of them were.  I would still love them just as much.  See, that means he has doubt.  Except maybe the baby.  That means he has doubt.  Except maybe the baby.  I haven't really connected yet. 
[00:58:30]  Why haven't you connected with your baby?  I play a lot of golf.  I bought something off a late night.  Television for golf.  Do you watch the Golf Channel ever?  Here and there.  Have you ever seen this V harness thing you put on?  Yes, I've seen the V harness.  I've seen the V harness.  I've seen the V harness.  I've seen the V harness.  Can you put up the.  Thanks, Danny.  You've got to see the V harness.  I do know this one.  It's pretty good.  Oh, God.  This helps your swing.  Yeah.  But you have a. 
[00:59:00]  Your swing is retarded.  No, I fixed it.  You shoot, you know, you shoot good numbers, but your swing sucks.  Not anymore.  Because of the V harness?  The V harness.  Really?  Yes.  And what does the V harness do?  You put a girl in it, right?  Yeah.  There's two.  You see the elastics on the side there?  Uh-huh.  When you put it on and you pull the club back, if it breaks, if it doesn't stay, if the tension  doesn't stay tense or whatever. 
[00:59:30]  I think I'm seeing it.  Then.  Yeah.  Wow.  Then you're swinging wrong.  Looks dangerous.  Huh?  Looks dangerous.  It's kind of cool.  Looks like it gets snapped back and hit you or something.  Why is Kenny Rogers selling the V harness?  Kenny Rogers.  With a horrible hair system, by the way.  Yeah, no.  I think it's good.  I haven't taken it to the range yet.  I did it in my hotel room.  Do you know how much people would laugh at you if you went to the range with that thing?  I think you'd be laughed at. 
[01:00:00]  You think so?  Yeah.  Like, even if it works.  If it was a shooting range, not a golf range.  That would be silly.  Because in golf, people, you do anything they can and buy any kind of product.  To try to get better, right.  To try to get better.  What are you kidding me?  What are you doing?  I'm taking the grease off the bacon.  But there's still a lot of grease.  It's bacon.  It's turkey bacon.  Just enjoy your bacon.  Yeah?  Really?  Aren't you not even supposed to dig on swine?  This is turkey bacon.  Oh, it's turkey bacon.  And that's the kind of attitude that's going to turn you into Ralphie.  Attitude. 
[01:00:30]  Ralphie who?  May.  Oh, God.  Oh, the drug dealer?  He got caught in Guam.  You haven't heard yet?  What happened?  Ralphie May got caught in Guam with pot on him.  In Guam?  How many fucking dummy is petting?  He's petting fucking drug dogs.  You haven't heard this story yet, Ed?  We haven't talked about it yet.  Oh, shit.  I heard that, too.  Was he really petting drug dogs?  Not only one.  He petted the second one. 
[01:01:00]  Once, he petted and sat.  Wasn't it at the airport?  Oh, my God.  I had a dog at an airport.  You avoid those dogs.  Well, you never travel with pot.  Don't bind you.  So where is he now?  Is he in a Guam prison?  No, Guam is part of the country.  I know it is.  My brother lived there for a while.  Somehow.  I don't know what that means.  But, and so they just let him go.  Like, if that was turkey, they'd be making, like, fucking Midnight Express 2.  Oh, forget about it.  So, good old Ralphie May.  Think how much hash he could tape to his body. 
[01:01:30]  Corn beef.  Oh, Ralphie.  Ralphie May says, stupid to pet drug-sniffing dogs.  Why?  If you have pot on you, wouldn't you just avoid all dogs and just assume that maybe one of  these dogs around the airport is a drug-sniffing dog?  No, a lot of the cops bring their pet dogs to work.  Yeah, just have fun with.  Yeah, you know, they get lonely.  He thought they were blind police officers and they were just seeing-eyed dogs for them. 
[01:02:00]  He thought they were Middle Easterns traveling.  Yeah.  You gotta think he's...  The women.  He's got a new hour of material now, though, so he's gotta be pumped.  He is a writing machine, this guy.  Yeah.  He comes up with a new hour special every week.  It's unbelievable.  Wait, here's the story.  When I got to baggage claim, this is, of course, Ralphie May's words, I actually walked up 
[01:02:30]  to the dog.  I love dogs and petted Nikki, the beautiful shepherd mix, and she sat down.  That indicates to the handler that I had marijuana on me.  Yeah, that's how they react.  They sit.  I didn't know that.  I just thought that the dog loved me.  Then another dog came over and it sat down as well.  I petted that dog, too.  I was thinking these dogs love me.  They could tell I'm a dog person.  He could be the stupidest person alive.  First of all, the dog sacked, because they knew if they moved, they could have been eaten. 
[01:03:00]  They saw the perp and they stood still.  Wow.  That is just stupid.  What the hell was he thinking?  Was Ralphie looking for a bump in his career and said, you know what?  Yeah.  I'll take a little marijuana charge.  I'll have a great story to tell.  Yeah.  This is suspicious.  Who's this stupid?  Where's Ralphie?  Now we have a reason to have him on the show.  Can we call Ralphie, May?  All right.  We'll try.  I hear they did a body cavity search and that Kittner boy fell out. 
[01:03:30]  No answer on his phone.  Did he eat it?  Just everything's a fat eating joke.  Jesus.  Fuck it.  You know, Lee's going to back up something I was going to say.  Lee, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  I wasn't sure, so I didn't say it.  But go ahead, Lee.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  I read online that they eat this, not that shit, that turkey bacon is worse than real  bacon because it's loaded full of salt and salt is worse than, you know. 
[01:04:00]  Well, don't they salt up the regular bacon?  Yeah.  A little bit.  But, you know, to make any kind of flavor out of turkey, they got to fill it full of things.  You know, and the one thing that you're trying to avoid is salt.  No, I don't.  I don't.  First of all, you know, it's funny.  When I was out of work, I would always cruise the Internet and find out about turkey bacon  and stuff like that.  I don't eat pork or red meat.  He's saying you're out of work, sir. 
[01:04:30]  I don't eat.  It has nothing to do with health.  That's not the reason I don't eat.  That's the reason I'm eating turkey bacon because I just don't eat red meat or pork.  You know, so there's some salt in it.  Yeah, there's a lot of salt in things.  But how much salt is in turkey bacon?  I go behind the scenes and find the bacon conspiracy.  Right, Jesse?  Shut up.  But you brought it up.  I know.  I get confused when you say that.  I got a yell at Jesse.  We wouldn't have had Jesse on the air if you decide not to do the Jesse impression.  I'm very confused by you. 
[01:05:00]  But I learned, though, for a while there, I was trying to eat better, and I would get  the ground chicken instead of ground beef and throw that in my sauce, and it tasted  almost as good.  Almost.  Let's relax.  But it's a good alternative.  Then I learned to make ground chicken.  They throw everything in there.  All the shit that is, like the skin and everything else, the parts of the chicken you don't want  to eat because it is bad for you.  But isn't there, like, ground chicken you can get that is, like, the top of the line? 
[01:05:30]  Where?  Because you can get shitty ground beef, too, but you can get like this stuff.  I read that it's pretty much maybe a specialty store, but the basic chicken, ground chicken  shit in your supermarket is worse than ground beef.  Here's what you got to do.  You got to go to a fucking butcher, you pick out some nice chicken cutlets or some shit,  and give it to the butcher and go, hey, grind this up, motherfucker.  And take the skin off.  No, here's what he's talking about.  What Anthony's talking about, what you're talking about has eight grams of fat in his 
[01:06:00]  ground chicken.  I don't know grams of fat.  I wasn't talking about eight grams of fat.  Well, I'm going to tell you.  You're talking about eight grams of fat.  And then what he's talking about is ground.  You stupid V-harness wearing faggot.  He's talking about, okay, woo, let's start the day off.  So he's talking about ground chicken breast, which is two grams of fat.  Is this how they make it?  It's got to be the best.  No, it tastes hard.  What he's talking about is better tasting.  It tastes better because it has all the skin and all the fat shit. 
[01:06:30]  Well, I don't know if they put skin in.  I know like hot dogs or like pork roll or Scrapple has like the pork.  We also saw the pink sludge by now, right?  That was on the internet.  No, what's that?  You didn't see the pink sludge?  This is how they make your chicken McNuggets?  You didn't see the pink sludge?  They're supposed to be like fucking a type of plastic in chicken McNuggets.  Some kind of a foam inhibitor or some shit.  I never thought growing up when I was eating more fast food than I do now,  I never thought the chicken McNuggets tasted like chicken. 
[01:07:00]  Now I know why.  It was just whatever it was tasted good with the sauce they gave you.  You haven't seen the pink sludge?  No, is that?  There was a picture of the pink sludge and they said,  this is what makes Chicken McNuggets.  Now they're grinding up chicken, but they grind up everything.  That's what I was getting at.  That was just dead chicken.  Look at this mess.  Two girls and a chicken cup.  Food starch modified.  A shitload of salt.  Salt ground mustard.  This is the hot dog one. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, the hot dog one.  Brutal too.  My God.  It's the same thing.  We're a bunch of Marys.  Look at this.  What the hell is that yellow stuff?  I don't know, but the government knows.  That's thermite paint.  And of course, just add water.  Just add water.  Of course.  Stupid Jesse.  With fluoride in it.  Yes, fluoride is being put in everything to dwindle down the population.  You know, I saw this one.  This is how they make hot dogs.  Yeah.  How it's made rules. 
[01:08:00]  This, I haven't eaten a hot dog since I saw this one.  Because look how fucking disgusting that looks.  I know in the end the hot dog tastes good.  It looks like a fat kick.  No, it really did.  Ah, shit.  Look, it's petting a drug dog.  That looks like a rough Sunday morning after a lot of drinking.  Yeah.  What's coming out of that pipe.  Oh, what are they, casings?  Yeah, and then they shove it in the casings.  Oh, man.  Yeah, man.  This is so sick.  Yeah, look.  Wow, look at all them hot dogs. 
[01:08:30]  They're flying out.  Those are frankfutters.  Oh, God.  Who's this Nazi woman fucking?  You think she enjoys grabbing the frankfutters?  Oh, look at that.  I bet she could give a great hand job.  Every day, that's what she does.  Kill yourself.  Throw yourself in the machine.  That's what they do when they terminate employees.  Just put them in that big auger.  Oh, sure.  Make fucking hot dogs out of them.  I'm sure.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, I haven't eaten a hot dog since.  This is how it's made.  You know what always amazes me when I watch things like How It's Made and you watch shows 
[01:09:00]  like this, is how much of this shit they sell.  Like, how many people are buying hot dogs?  Apparently, billions of fucking people.  Right.  Because they need all these hot dogs.  They can't go one day without making them.  Making just millions of them.  And it's like, oh, let's see how a fucking doorknob mechanism is made.  And then they show doorknob machines and millions of fucking doorknobs are flying.  It's like, how many fucking doorknobs does everyone need?  You're so right. 
[01:09:30]  They just make a shitload of these things.  Like, there would be a real problem if the doorknob factory shut down for a day.  They shut down for a day.  People would be going, I can't leave my house.  I got no doorknob.  I hate in a window when a doorknob truck doesn't come anymore.  I know.  Where do you get your doorknob?  Yeah, where?  Boy, these guys are making...  Danny had a good idea to have a show on how they make the machines on how it's made. 
[01:10:00]  You know, like the presses and the dyes.  Because it's all like one-off stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like, you know, the same machine that makes the ball bearings is going to make the hot dogs.  No, no.  So there's specialty machines.  So do a show on how they make the machines.  And there's so much shit.  Like, I don't even...  I would love to know, like, who maintains all that shit?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, what happens when something breaks and you need a part?  Like, how do you have to make a whole new one-off part?  They actually do.  I worked at a place called Deutsch Relays, and they made relays.  Whatever.  And there were machines that were specialty machines that would make armatures and little screws just custom-made for all this shit. 
[01:10:30]  And there was an old guy that ran around with a monocle, and he was German, a monocle and an oil can.  And his whole job was to maintain all the machines.  And every day, he'd have his monocle down, one machine would be shut down, and then they would take the die out, and like a machinist on duty, would get to the big Bridgeport milling machine and just start grinding away a new piece, pop it in. 
[01:11:00]  It's like I was watching a movie with Colin whatever.  Maybe, no, it wasn't him.  It wasn't him.  No.  But he was working...  Colin who?  No, it wasn't Colin.  It was the other guy.  Oh, the other one.  He was working in a machine shop.  He lost, like, 300 pounds to do this.  Oh, yeah.  The machinist.  Kristen Bell.  Kristen Bell.  Right?  The machinist.  Yeah, I don't...  Something tells me that movie probably confused you.  I thought he was making Schindler's List 2, and he's... 
[01:11:30]  But, and, like, when someone caught their hand and lost an arm, it's kind of almost like an officer being shot or something.  That's how they treat it at a machine shop.  You know?  It's like the...  Like the lieutenant getting fragged or something.  Yeah, the flag goes ahead.  They don't have mass when somebody loses a finger.  Everybody's quiet that day at work.  You know?  There's always an arm gets pulled in.  You know, you can always tell a wood shop teacher, because they always only have, like, two fingers.  Yeah.  You know?  Not...  Not...  Not good enough to stay at his job, so he had to teach. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  So he's at the wood shop with two fingers missing.  And there's always these rumors of how he lost it.  My friend was cutting wood with a power saw and took off four of his fingers.  What, was he holding the wood in front of the blade?  He was...  He had a hangover, his little buzz.  Oh, yeah.  And he's cut, right?  So the fingers come off like this, and he's kind of, like, in shock.  And there's some little kid running around and stuff outside where the house he's working. 
[01:12:30]  And he yells, go get me a bag of ice.  So, you know...  And now the kid's traumatized for...  What's the word?  The kid's certainly not traumatized.  Sound it out.  Traumatized is going up on the wall.  Oh, look, our list has gone.  What happened to our list?  Well, someone took our list.  We just updated it with all the new stuff.  Oh, good.  Oh, good.  We'll add trauma-ized.  Get trauma-ized on there.  He's full of trauma.  And...  My friend put his fingers in the bag, and they reconnected them. 
[01:13:00]  But they're not right.  They're not the right fingers in the right places.  Why?  What the fuck did a doctor fuck up?  Why did they move them around?  He shattered a bunch of them.  You know, they had to piece them on as good as they could.  It doesn't look bad.  I mean...  Right.  You know, it's his left hand, so thank God he doesn't have to shake your hand with his  fucked up fingers.  I don't want to shake any dead hands ever.  Ugh.  No.  On living people especially.  There was a guy in my neighborhood, this old black alcoholic, and he burnt his hand in  a fire, and it just was all molded into one, like, long fucking... 
[01:13:30]  One long...  Like, it was like this.  Why can't he split that shit back?  That amazing people melt.  Huh?  Why can't he split that back into fingers?  I don't know.  Anybody want a piece of turkey bacon?  What did that idiot just do on that video?  Oh, he's...  It's...  It's...  Watched a video of a circular saw.  A guy's putting his finger right up close to a circular saw.  It's a safety mechanism called saw stop.  And basically, it makes it so that you can't cut your fingers off.  Bullshit!  Because basically what happens is, like, there's a small electrical pulse running through the 
[01:14:00]  saw blade, so the second it makes contact with something that could conduct the...  Like, this brake kind of grabs the saw and stops it and pulls the saw blade into the  circular saw.  Look, it broke, though.  Yeah, well, I mean, hey...  Yeah, but you got your fingers.  Yeah, you see that or...  Missing fingers.  My shredder has, like, two electrodes on it, so you can't stick your fingers in there.  If you complete the circuit with your finger, it stops.  It's amazing.  Safety.  Safety.  Yeah, well...  Why don't we do this before we... 
[01:14:30]  Where's the 10-10 people?  Oh, boy.  Look out.  10-10.  We got something on the 10-10 people.  Who cares?  Where the fuck did it go?  What did it do?  Was that guy willing to test his own fucking machine by...  Yeah, that was his finger.  Yep.  Putting his finger in there?  Obviously, he doesn't have interns.  Yeah, go ahead.  Anthony, yesterday was 10-10-10.  Rich, did you know yesterday was 10-10-10? 
[01:15:00]  Yes, I do.  It was a very special day.  I renewed my vows.  Yesterday?  Yeah, I'm 10-10-10.  Did you really?  No.  No.  Renewing vows, please.  It's like going to fucking counseling.  You never consider counseling?  Did you go with your ex?  Yeah, I went with my ex.  How'd that work out?  I wrote a joke about it.  Back in and down.  You remember that one I used to do?  Spent $5,000 to have two women call me.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I used to team up on...  First of all, counseling makes no sense, 
[01:15:30]  because what are you going to do?  Explain your whole life.  They have to know the back...  They have to know everything to make...  You know what I mean?  Yeah, to make an assessment of why you two are like the way you are.  Yeah.  You have to go way back, yeah.  You know, anything I do.  And if the one person explains their point better,  then they're going to win.  Yeah, of course.  Well, she could be the asshole.  Yeah, exactly.  And you would think the one who's paying should be the winner.  Yeah, counseling is ridiculous.  Well, yesterday was a very special day, 10-10-10, 
[01:16:00]  and a lot of people thought they had the original idea of getting married on 10-10-10,  so it's a little special for them.  Yeah, and it makes it easier to remember the anniversary, I guess.  Basically, half the world got married yesterday.  Yeah.  Thinking they were the only ones that came up with this brilliant idea  to get married on 10-10-10.  10-10-10.  Yeah.  Weddings are special every day,  but on this day, 10-10-2010,  to help...  Why did she ruin it?  She ruined it by saying 10-10-2010.  Right, just say 10-10-10. 
[01:16:30]  No.  Dope.  I think your 10-10 must have been good.  Did 10-10-10-10-10-10?  Did 10-10-10-10 have fun with 10-10-10?  They did the 10-10 twins.  What is that?  It was these girls that were born on 10-10 and they're twins.  I don't get it.  I don't either, but John Montone had fun with them.  They were born October 10th, but what year?  Yeah, exactly.  19-10.  They wheeled with men.  Weddings are special every day,  but on this day, 10-10-2010, 
[01:17:00]  Suhel Fernandez and Juan Rodriguez  of Washington Heights, Manhattan,  found perfection.  She picked the date, and I agreed.  You can never forget our anniversary.  Never.  Yes, yes.  St. Rose...  First of all, obviously weddings aren't special,  at least mine wasn't,  when it came to the people that showed up,  so they're not really special.  Are you going to let it go ever?  Oh, no, I forgot.  It's stuck in my head.  Just let it go.  It's stuck in my head.  I even apologized to you. 
[01:17:30]  Let it fucking go.  I thought I was going to a comedy show.  I'm sorry.  Apology would be a gift in the mail.  That's how...  Let it go.  If you need a special day to remember...  To remember, yeah.  Well, I did.  A court date.  Ant didn't remember his wedding day.  I didn't remember.  I got it mixed up with Swallow's Day,  which was March 19th,  and my anniversary was May 19th.  It was up on the stand with Dominic Barber  like fucking giving me the old one-two in court 
[01:18:00]  during the divorce.  And he goes,  When was your anniversary?  Anthony, tell me the date of your wedding anniversary.  And I was sitting there,  and I'm just going to...  I go, uh, March 19th?  No, that is incorrect.  Your Honor, do you see the misery  she had to go through in the door  with the shut up, you fuck?  Really?  I mixed it up.  Because you made a mistake on the anniversary?  How many people...  I mixed it up, yeah.  ...forget their anniversary?  Yeah, a lot of people, 
[01:18:30]  unless you're 10-10-10.  It was May 19th,  and I mistook it for March 19th.  Come on, the M is in there.  Well, what do I give a shit?  Close enough.  But yeah, it was close enough.  The 10-10-10 thing is stupid, too,  because it could have been 10-10-09, 10-10-08,  because, you know, the year doesn't matter,  unless you're trying to remember  how many years you've been married.  I guess.  That might work,  but if you can't remember that shit,  go bye.  Yeah, maybe.  Go bye!  Yeah, but what makes it special, 
[01:19:00]  if they don't use a year,  then you could...  I could do it 12 times a year.  Oh, yeah.  You know?  10-10-10-10-10-9-9.  11-11-9-9, you know,  so that's what makes it...  We can't do...  No one can do this again  until next year in November 11th.  11-11-11.  There you go.  And then we'll get a 12-12-12.  No, that's where the world ends.  Oh, yeah, we don't do that one.  It's over.  Mayans.  Yeah, forgot about the Mayans.  Fucking everything up for us.  Oh, yeah, that was...  Yeah, I saw the movie. 
[01:19:30]  St. Rose of Lima Church  in Washington Heights  hosted another bride  walking down the same aisle  later in the afternoon.  Ah, dummy.  And these are just two  of the more than 31,000 ceremonies  scheduled for...  There you go.  Your special day is shared  by half the world.  31,000?  What, in the country, I guess?  No, in the area?  No, it's St. Patrick's.  Couldn't have been.  Oh, I don't know.  How many people are married?  You can't get 31,000 fucking weddings  in one spot?  No.  But I mean, in the country, I guess? 
[01:20:00]  I would think in the world.  Going world?  Country.  I would go the country.  I would go the country.  Wait, wait, 31,000 people  getting married?  Yeah.  But every weekend, there's weddings.  So how many weddings  across the country  on any given Saturday, Danny?  What would you think?  What's that?  I'm sorry.  You're good at this shit.  Say again?  How many weddings  on any given Saturday in America?  Wow.  What would your guess be?  They're saying 31,000 yesterday.  We don't know... 
[01:20:30]  I would say 50,000.  I would say 50,000.  I would say 1,000 a state.  I would round it off.  50,000.  Every Saturday,  there's 1,000 weddings per state.  Do you think so?  So then what's the big deal of...  It's got to be less than 31,000.  Because they said 31,000.  10, 10, 10 was a big one.  That would be my guess.  All right.  It says here  that around 2.3 million couples  get married in the U.S. every year,  which breaks down 
[01:21:00]  to about 6,200 weddings a day.  So why is 31,000...  Well, I think...  I mean, that's averaging.  So, I mean,  let's say most of these  happen on the weekends.  Okay, I got confused.  So about 6,000 a day  get married  in the United States of America.  Yesterday was 31,000.  So there was a massive spike  because of the special  10, 10, 10 thing.  Yeah.  Got it.  So that means 40, what?  2,000 timing of weddings?  Is that there, down there  if you scroll down a little more?  42,000 weddings a week? 
[01:21:30]  Is that what we're looking at about?  Weddings take place.  All right.  So all these people  that thought they picked  a special day,  there was a massive spike  in weddings yesterday.  Instead of 6,000 couples  getting married yesterday,  there was 31,000.  Caterers were out of control yesterday.  It was insane.  Ceremonies scheduled  for 10, 10, 10,  according to Brides Magazine.  In Las Vegas,  couples gambled  on the lucky date.  And in South Korea,  close to 7,000 couples 
[01:22:00]  joined together  in a mass ceremony.  Back in Brooklyn,  Mo Massoud  wanted a wedding date  that would be considered  lucky and numerical.  Believe it or not,  years and years ago,  I've always hoped  that this would be the day.  There are just  two more lucky number dates left,  11, 11, 11,  and 12, 12, 12.  Then,  that's it  until the year 3,000.  In Korea.  Oh, fuck, man.  Oh, shit.  I'm waiting for the year 3,000.  Yeah, well, yeah.  That's when I'll get married again. 
[01:22:30]  Only a few of us  will be alive  in the year 3,000.  to enjoy that one.  I'm going to be frozen.  My head with Ted Williams,  right next to Ted Williams' head.  His defrosting head.  You joke,  but my pal Weez,  when he dies,  he's fucking having a skull  on the mantle  for his family to enjoy.  That's kind of sick.  Did you guys talk about that  when you were out there?  He's dead serious about it.  He wants to put his skull  on the mantle?  He is.  On the left side of the mantle?  Yeah, way left.  It fell off.  It fell off.  He is going to have 
[01:23:00]  his skull preserved.  Not his head,  his skull.  Oh.  So instead of the family  having his ashes,  they're going to have  his fucking skull.  That's fucked up.  He's serious.  That can't fuck kids up at all.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's fine.  Daddy's skull on the mantle?  That's fucked up right there.  It is, right?  Yeah.  I told him it was.  That's what I want to do  at my funeral.  I want to stand up.  I want to be propped up  with a mic in front of me  and have a tape playing.  Like, you know.  So you die again?  So I die. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Like he's dying.  I'm dying.  Is it hot down here?  The comic that never dies.  Shecky Cumberbund,  the comic that never dies.  He'll be standing there  with a microphone.  That would be unique.  They had one guy  on a motorcycle  and it looked like  he was racing on a bike.  It was creepy.  It was creepy.  You just put him in the box,  shut the lid,  put a picture,  play nice music,  go get something to eat.  Play some Time of My Life  by Green Day.  Yeah, whatever.  You want to be buried  with something? 
[01:24:00]  Like, do you want to put,  like, do you...  No, who gives a shit?  You don't want a golf club  or something?  No, who gives a shit?  You want to be golfing?  You don't want...  I want a phone.  Your arms would go flying.  Do any of you guys  have the fear  of waking up in your coffin?  Do you ever have that...  You don't have that...  That's claustrophobic.  I think technology these days  is pretty good  with pointing out  if you're dead or not.  Yeah.  Do you remember  the Twilight Zone  where they didn't know  that guy was dead  until a tear came down his eye?  A tear came down his eye.  So, I mean, crazy.  That's why I want  one of those houses,  those mausoleums 
[01:24:30]  or whatever the fuck  they call those things,  you know?  Yeah, that's a mausoleum.  Mausoleum, right?  And you just sit up  with a phone or whatever?  Are the Jews allowed  to have those?  Huh?  If you sublet it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they just rent them out  and never maintain them properly.  I got other people living.  Yeah.  There's like 40 black guys  in one room that we...  The Jews trying to evict them.  They won't leave.  They'll always end up in court.  By the way,  that news dummy was beyond wrong. 
[01:25:00]  I hope everyone picked up on it.  Yeah.  It's going to happen  way before 3000.  How?  2101.  Because it's 201.  So then it'll be 111.  It'll have to be 21.  And then 222.  And then we do the whole cycle again.  21, 21, 21.  Why?  What's the difference  between 2010  and 2110?  Wait, what?  Hold on.  21, 21.  What's the 21st month?  No. 
[01:25:30]  That's not how they do it.  Yeah.  Because we're in 2010.  Yeah.  10.  Yeah, but the last two are 10.  So.  We're not looking at the 20 part.  So you're looking at, what, 20?  Yesterday it was 10, 10, 10.  So when it's 21.  2100.  Right.  Why?  We do the 10, 10, 10 again.  01.  01.  01.  Right.  Yeah, I fucked it up with the 10. 
[01:26:00]  No, that's right.  Why can't you?  Well, she said it won't happen  until 3000.  Hey, what the hell's wrong  with this dummy?  I fucked up by saying the 10 part.  I'm sorry.  No, you're right.  But 2101, it'll be 111.  Yeah.  So this shit will happen again.  That dummy.  You're right.  And when does the 10 thing happen again?  Is that what she was getting at?  2110.  It does, right?  So what is she talking about?  2110, it gets to 10, 10, 10.  Yeah, because it's 2010 now.  It's not 10, 10.  Or will we be saying 110? 
[01:26:30]  10 is starting to sound like a funny word now.  I can say it too long.  All right.  Let's get stupid.  Okay, yeah.  That was wrong.  In 100 years, we'd just do it over again.  Everyone's saying it now.  Okay, yeah.  She's an idiot.  Right.  Why would she say it won't happen again  until 3000?  I don't know.  Wow.  Wow.  She's a woman, and women are stupid.  They are.  Dummies.  Get her in the kitchen and bake something.  Leave the broadcasting toss.  Ah, shit.  Hope he's right.  Okay, 112101 will be 111. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Yep.  And then you can just keep doing it every year after that, right?  2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  Hey, are we doing Jocktober today, Ant?  I sure hope so.  Yeah, we should do a little Jocktober.  We got to get them.  Why are you staring, you fucking ghoul?  Are you all right?  Is Rich just staring?  He was just staring at me.  Well, because your eyes weren't there.  Are you all right?  I was spanking. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, wow.  When that happens.  That's why I picked up on the stare.  It was, like, lifeless.  What is he doing?  He has to shut all of his systems down to think.  Like, all the basic systems have to just shut down.  His heartbeat slows down.  It's like 10 beats per minute.  His eyesight goes, hearing, everything.  He's just thinking.  I've known you forever, and I've never seen a stare like that before.  You all right?  Yeah.  What were you thinking of?  Huh?  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[01:28:00]  I was thinking I could use a few more cans of that part of the meter.  Exactly.  What goes on in that mind of yours, Carl?  It was a lifeless stare.  You all right?  Yeah, yeah, I'm good.  That was great.  What were you thinking of?  Do you know?  Yeah, a couple.  I was thinking about when you said Jocktober.  I'm going, I wonder if it's going to be one of the radio shows I've done.  If it is what we're doing this year, because we fucked up a lot of you guys last year, just  walk out until we're done.  But I can't imagine you being on any of these shitty shows.  You guys need some of these shitty shows. 
[01:28:30]  It doesn't matter anymore.  To get some people in the seats.  You know what?  Here's the thing.  If you're in this business, and you can't take a joke, you're in the wrong business.  That's what I'm saying.  I mean, are any shows going to help you sell out bananas?  The Comedy Club in Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey.  One show Friday, October 15th.  And two shows Saturday, October 16th.  If you need tickets, go to bananascomedyclub.com or call 201-727-1090 for Rich Voss. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  I'll sell it if a fucking plane crashes in the room.  Fucking sell out.  It'd be more fun.  I'm going to fucking shit out of that.  I feel less of a disaster is what you're saying.  I think that's what he's trying to say, man.  Rich is great on stage, man.  I don't fail.  Fucking hysterical.  I'm just on stage.  He kills.  He's great.  He kills.  I do an hour and a half, two hours, whatever.  I just did up in Rochester, Ohio.  The O&A fans, you know, they come out. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They absolutely come out.  But the only thing I hate.  Unfortunately, they do come out.  They do come out.  It's like Groundhog's Day.  Assholes.  I know.  They come out.  You could spot them, too.  You could smell them.  Well, they could say stand when you're selling CDs or before.  They're standing.  You know how I was just looking?  Yeah, yeah.  That's how they look.  They got that look all the time.  And it's like they're standing like they're ready to walk in and start just shooting.  Like, you know what I mean?  It's either they're waiting for their mom to pull away because their mom just dropped them off. 
[01:30:00]  You know, and they're 42.  And they're just standing there.  And then, you know, they say something really uncomfortable.  Or, you know, you're just like, talk.  Say something.  Do something.  You know.  Stand there.  You know, can you imagine if you were a hot broad?  How they would fucking act?  You know, standing next to you.  Masturbating like a monkey in front of her.  Not even caring or knowing it's wrong.  Creeps.  Ghouls.  Like a monkey. 
[01:30:30]  They are just awful people.  What do you want to do?  Take a break and then do some Jocktober there.  Oh, yeah, we could do a little of that.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  Also, we're doing what the hell is that?  We'll explain the what the hell is that bit with an update.  Love that one.  After these messages.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  So, do we have a problem with the online feed or not? 
[01:31:00]  Yes.  I've been hearing things off and on for a couple of weeks.  Yeah, every time someone's listening to the online feed, at some point it just switches to Rana Fez.  A lot of people on Twitter saying.  So, is it a real problem?  It is a real, actual problem, and I don't know who the fuck to talk to about this.  How great is that?  Yeah.  That we don't know who to talk to?  Yeah.  How great is that?  How great is that?  It's astounding.  You just insulted the babysitters, by the way.  It's astounding.  That would be the babysitter's job. 
[01:31:30]  It's a problem that's been addressed, but never solved.  But if we know that the online feed is fucking up, and the listeners know the online feed is fucking up, why aren't the babysitters taking care of the problem?  That's the problem I'm trying to uncover.  Why does O.P. and Anthony's feed keep turning into the Ron and Fez show?  It's a conspiracy of biblical proportions.  Those guys are ridiculous. 
[01:32:00]  Ridiculous.  Like, fix the fucking thing.  It's basic shit.  If you're a babysitter for 202 and 197, and there's obviously an issue, you have to know about it.  Get it fixed.  You have something to do today.  Congratulations.  If they even came to work today, I don't even know.  A lot of people listen online.  Of course a lot of people.  No answer is what we get.  No answer.  That's it.  No answer.  I'm not saying who typed that.  Yeah.  It's right here on my BlackBerry. 
[01:32:30]  I got a no answer.  Oh, God.  Unbelievable.  What do they do?  Does anyone know what they do?  The babysitters?  I know they fuck up bits.  Wait to hear this one, Ant.  Yeah.  And then we'll move on.  It's, you know, I don't even get mad anymore because it's just laughable.  It really is just laughable.  You know when you want to do that prostate thing with Dr. Steve?  Dr. Steve.  You mean one of the funny fucking bits that would, like, people would really be like,  wow, that's kind of funny and entertaining. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  It would be a lot of good conversation between Dr. Steve and the lunatics that come up here.  Sure.  I'm going to take you through an email thing, okay?  This is going to make a lot of sense, and then we'll move on.  So one of the babysitters, Gary, he calls me on Friday.  It's Friday.  What did I tell him?  Between 6 and 10, I'm all ears.  Yeah.  I don't do nothing after 10 o'clock for anyone anymore.  I am a la carte. 
[01:33:30]  So guess what?  Because I had him write you back and forth a couple times, you're going to be billed.  I'm a la carte.  Do you understand?  You're sending a bill for a text?  Yes.  Friday afternoon when I'm hanging out with my wife and my kid, and you're trying to get  a hold of me, that's a la carte time.  You are now getting a bill.  Are you like a lawyer where you'll bill in, like, 10-minute increments?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not joking, man.  They chose this for us, not us.  Between 6 and 10, you won't know the difference. 
[01:34:00]  This show will rock as best as we could possibly do this radio show.  And you always round up.  11 minutes is 20 minutes.  But at 10 o'clock, I ain't fucking around.  I ain't talking to nobody.  They're not paying me enough.  So stop.  So he calls me, and of course I don't answer the phone because I see it's him.  I'm like, I'm not talking to you.  I don't talk to the babysitters.  They don't have my respect at all.  At all.  Because of things like this, by the way, the online feed.  They can't even fix the basic problems around here. 
[01:34:30]  So finally, I just, look, you can see it for yourself.  Yeah.  Subject, what's up?  And then in the place where you should be writing a long email, it's just a question mark.  How much do you charge for texting a question mark?  That's a lot of money, Ed.  That's a quarter hour right there.  That's a quarter hour, yeah.  So then he writes back, just want to quickly walk through Dr. Steve's time on your show next week 
[01:35:00]  and make sure we can do things you want.  And how long have we been doing this?  A long fucking time.  A long time.  What does that mean?  I didn't even go over this with Anthony before I just brought it up on the show.  But watch what my pal does right here.  What does that email mean?  Problem.  Thank you.  Red flag.  Thank you.  Not going to happen.  Thank you.  I'm like, what, do you think I was born yesterday, you stupid dope?  And this is the lulling you into this. 
[01:35:30]  Right.  Like, all right, we'll gently ease into the fact that we can't do that.  We're here for you.  You're not here for me or Anthony.  Everything is supposed to be fought for.  Right.  But it doesn't work that way.  So, exactly.  That's what I was thinking.  So then I'm like, okay.  Anyway, so I wrote back, babysitting my kid right now, what's the issues?  I call it babysitting my own kid, Rich.  Isn't that terrific?  What's the issues?  Because I'm not getting on the fucking phone.  By the way, another quarter hour.  All right. 
[01:36:00]  Charge to him.  And he writes, would rather talk it through.  Oh, boy.  That ain't happening.  Talk it through ain't good.  That ain't happening.  You know what?  Talk it through means he couldn't just text, well, it's a go.  Of course.  You know, that would be easy.  Well, it's a go.  We'll discuss the details later.  God bless you.  Because just in case I confused the first email, the second made it very obvious what's going on here.  Okay.  So he writes, would rather talk it through, but assuming we work through getting the proctology bit approved. 
[01:36:30]  What does that mean?  Assuming.  Assuming.  Usually when they say assuming something, it never happens.  Right.  That is corporate bullshit.  I wanted to talk about how we get enough participants on both that and what the hell is that.  And then Travis mentioned we didn't have volunteers yet, so I want to see if you were up for focusing on one bit.  Just one bit at a time.  We wanted to do a lot of stuff while Dr. Steve was up here.  We wanted to set the Guinness Book of World Records for what? 
[01:37:00]  Most proctology exams.  Most fingers in the asshole within a four-hour period.  Like we're going to have a bunch of guys line up, and Dr. Steve's going to put the fucking gloves on.  Right.  One glove at a time.  Whap.  Rip that off.  Another glove.  Another glove.  And then go down the line and examine every guy's prostate.  Right.  Can't beat my record.  Right.  With fingers.  Not your cock.  Nope.  But why would they have anything against that?  He's a doctor. 
[01:37:30]  Exactly.  He's a doctor.  Rich Voss.  Okay.  Making perfect sense here.  Oh, you know what?  I'm a dentist.  Let me look at your teeth.  Well, let's go to the lawyers and find out if a dentist can do that.  I don't know if they can do that.  So he wrote that, right?  Yeah.  What do you think I did?  What do you think I did at this point, Anthony Cumia?  I did not discuss this before bringing it up on the air.  You've texted a single question mark.  I know that. 
[01:38:00]  You then asked a question.  By this point, Opie is probably fed up and doesn't answer.  Ring the bell.  He never got an answer.  He never got an answer to that email.  Oh, that is great.  Look for yourself.  You see Gary, Gary, Gary.  And what else do you see?  Nothing.  Yeah, I just figured at this point, it's your weekend.  Nothing.  It's like, why am I doing this?  Because they're just fucking up another bit.  I can't.  They'll never get my respect. 
[01:38:30]  Never.  So you guys.  Never.  Obviously signed a new contract.  Okay.  I don't know if Norton did because Danny's talking a lot.  But so can't you just close the curtains and do what you want?  You know what I mean?  And make it, make the, you know, I mean, make the decision yourself.  Like, I think you guys know from the past that you'll make the right decision.  Of course.  This is only, this is only part A.  By the way. 
[01:39:00]  Part A.  By the way, Anthony.  Yeah.  We were just talking about the online feed.  But, and someone is going, oh, here they go again, right?  Yeah.  Because I'm bringing this up on the air.  Thank you.  Sorry, but it's a real issue for a lot of people.  They listen to our show online and it's been fucked up for, I don't, I, at least, you're  going to go with two weeks?  I was going to say at least a week.  So, okay.  I think it's longer than that.  At least two weeks, our show is crapping out.  It goes into some Ron and Fez stuff for a little while, then back to us.  It is a major issue.  So, sorry we're bringing it up on the air, but this is how people listen to our show, 
[01:39:30]  right?  You're not going to believe what I'm about to read to you.  Uh-oh.  Are we all in agreement it's been about two weeks?  Yep.  In agreement, it's been about two weeks, right?  Mm-hmm.  This is why I call them the babysitters.  This is why I don't respect them.  This is why I don't talk to them after 10 o'clock, except for a little nod and answer a couple  questions when I'm going in the elevator.  Two weeks at least.  Are you ready for this?  Yeah.  From Gary.  Am I going to get in trouble?  Because this is internal shit.  I got in trouble for this recently, too.  It's on your phone.  What's the current issue with the feed? 
[01:40:00]  Question mark.  I, in a tech, have just checked iPhone, BlackBerry, and online with no problems.  So, is he hearing about this for the first fucking time?  It's an issue that comes and goes.  So, maybe right now it's, everything's fine, but people are having a problem.  Apparently, this was brought up last week.  This issue was brought up last week.  What, what, what?  Can we read from the minutes of last week's meeting? 
[01:40:30]  Meetings that we don't go to?  That's what we're going to have to do, is like, just have, have a stenographer in there.  How many people are saying there's an issue?  They're now saying there's no issue, man.  Because they just checked it right now.  You know, you know how good you guys are.  I just realized how good you are.  Like, I could never go on stage at a comedy club and sit up there and trash the owner in front of them and expect to work there again.  These are babysitters.  They're not the owners.  They're guys that have no business running our channel because they have no experience at this type of radio. 
[01:41:00]  And they have no power?  They're very nice guys, and they're very good at programming music channels.  Very good.  Matter of fact, Gary programs one of the channels here that I really like.  But when it comes to this type of radio, they are in way over their fucking heads.  And, you know, Howard Stern has Tim Sabian.  Tim knows how to do this type of radio.  Tim Sabian is not waiting for Howard to bring it up on the air that there might be a problem with the online feed.  He's already on it. 
[01:41:30]  These guys aren't on it.  They're not on it at all.  Here's a tweet from an hour ago.  Fix the fucking online feed.  An hour ago, why can't I listen to your show one day online without it switching to Ron and Fez?  What the fuck am I paying for?  Here's another one.  Fix the online feed for the Opie and Anthony show.  And this is before we brought it up on the air, by the way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because it's time-coded.  Yep, yep.  So people are having issues. 
[01:42:00]  I don't know.  Did it go back to the Opie and Anthony show?  And maybe that's why when he checked, it works.  But for some reason, it's cutting out for a while every day and going to the Ron and Fez show.  Well, there is obviously something going on.  I don't know that shit as far as this business goes.  Maybe it's only happening to some cell phone.  I don't know.  But something is going on.  Yeah, XM Online has been an issue since its inception.  Intermittently, daily, $2.99 a month to hear every fifth word. 
[01:42:30]  Really?  Great.  Good.  Yeah, well, the listeners are pissed off out there.  Yeah.  Just fix it.  Get someone on there and fix it.  That's all we need.  You should tell them you talk to your listeners.  You talk to Frank and Tom, and they're pissed.  Yes, our two listeners.  You want part B of this whole scenario?  There's a B?  How many parts are we doing this in? 
[01:43:00]  Oh, boy.  Have you seen the Harry Potter show?  Are you ready for this?  Yeah.  What do we got?  Are you ready for this?  Yeah.  You know how we want to do the proctologist thing?  Yeah.  With the fingers up to the ears?  Yeah, prostate exam.  It actually saves lives.  Wait till you.  Let me read a little email from Dr. Steve now.  Oh.  By the way, by reading these emails on the air means less emails for me. 
[01:43:30]  Because now they're going to be not sending me emails knowing that I might read them on the air.  Just wanted to catch you up on what's going on as far as the prostate exam bit goes.  And as soon as I read that, I'm like, okay, what's the problem?  Problem.  What's the problem?  And just for the new listeners so they know, Dr. Steve's a great friend of us.  And he's a very good doctor.  But he lives in Tennessee.  And he comes up maybe once a year, sometimes twice a year.  And we always force him to shove his fingers up someone's ass. 
[01:44:00]  It's been Big A's ass.  It's been Tippi Tom's ass.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Homeless Tippi Tom's ass.  Okay?  Get it?  It's a good fucking bit to force a doctor to do horrific things.  So then we come up with the idea, wow, we should try to set the records of how many prostate exams this guy could do in one morning.  Yeah.  It's an okay bit, right?  Of course.  So Steve writes me yesterday, wanted to catch up on what's going on with the prostate exam bit.  So then I'm thinking right away, what the fuck is this problem now?  It's exhausting how many problems there are around here. 
[01:44:30]  From guys that said, look, we're going to work for the channel because we know how to work around the lawyers.  I'll never forget that, Ant.  Work around the lawyers.  On Friday, Rob Cross called me and asked me if I had a New York State medical license.  Oh, that's what happened to, that's Dr. Steve texting?  Yes.  They asked him if he had a New York State medical license.  Why would a guy need a New York State medical license, Anthony?  To check a prostate. 
[01:45:00]  Which we've been doing for years on this show.  For entertainment purposes, I don't give a fuck if you have a polyp in your asshole.  He's a doctor.  Who gives a shit?  Don't worry about it.  Who's the person with the polyp in the asshole?  Of course, but that's not my problem.  We're doing it to have fun.  The doctor's shoving his fingers up a homeless guy's ass.  That's good radio.  Of course, it rules.  Okay?  All of a sudden, even though we've been doing this for years,  they're asking if he has a New York State medical license.  He said the lawyers above him were concerned that I would be practicing medicine, Anthony, 
[01:45:30]  without a license if we did a diagnostic procedure on the air.  Practicing medicine without a license?  He's a fucking doctor checking prostates.  But he doesn't have a New York State medical license.  It would be in New York State.  We didn't have medical licenses when we were shoving wiffle ball bats up girls' assholes  by the way.  Well, speak for yourself.  I did go to years of medical school to learn how to properly place a wiffle ball bat in 
[01:46:00]  a woman's vagina.  Yeah, to keep it on the up and up.  Yes.  I think every time you check your prostate, you should have that curtain closed.  Someone gives Kenny like a dollar.  You open a curtain.  You see the finger go in.  Come, curtain closed.  Oh, and close the curtain like kind of a peep show.  That's what I'm thinking because now it's not medical.  Now it's cum on the window.  We'd have to do it.  Oh, we'll just get a squeegee.  Yeah, squeegee it all.  But the point being, you and I shoved a lot of wiffle ball bats up girls' memories. 
[01:46:30]  Or at least the show did.  Yeah.  We try to not, you know.  And really implicate anybody in particular.  Yeah, right.  Everyone else was blindfolded, so you never knew who was actually shoving that big fucking  bat up there.  And let it be known, it was on regular radio.  That's the point I made today.  So we went from regular radio where we were shoving wiffle ball bats up girls, and now  we can't do a basic prostate exam because the doctor, the doctor, an actual doctor might 
[01:47:00]  not have a New York State medical license.  Actually, he doesn't have the New York State medical license, Anthony.  So lawyers are concerned that practicing medicine without a license.  What are they concerned about?  Because you can shove fingers up people's assholes.  Yes, you can.  You really can.  Yeah.  There's not a problem, especially in a medical context.  Now, I'm not saying legally, like, what are they worried about legally in New York? 
[01:47:30]  Because you can't get the diagnosis after it.  You could say this is for, do I have to do everyone's jobs?  You just say it's for entertainment purposes.  That's all you say.  It's for entertainment purposes.  Like, you know, I'm not licensed in New York State, so I'm saying as a doctor in Tennessee,  you might have something going on in there, so I'm just suggesting you go to your regular  doctor.  But follow up with a regular doctor.  That's how it should be.  That's how every doctor gets aware of it.  That should be end of discussion.  Well, it's the same as when that doctor came in with a lung with cancer in it. 
[01:48:00]  That's a medical, you know, fill in the blanks.  You know, sometimes I get caught for words.  Fill in the blanks.  You know, that's the same as.  I'd like to with lead.  That's right.  One big blank.  Right?  Didn't your doctor used to come in with the screwed up lungs and stuff?  Yeah, I don't know where he was from.  Yeah.  You don't even know if he was a doctor.  He could have just been a lung guy.  Just some guy that was collecting fucking rotting body parts.  Oh, that's right.  A guy did bring in a cancerous lung.  That's when Norton quit smoking.  No, it was because of what the hell is that, and the guy might have had something in his 
[01:48:30]  mouth.  Oh.  Norton saw mouth cancer basically being diagnosed.  But that brings me back to what we're talking about today.  That guy, you know, the doctors were like, wow, you've got to see your regular doctor because  we're just doing this for fun on the radio.  Now it's getting real.  It turns out the guy was okay.  Uh-huh.  But, you know, thank God the guy got checked out.  You never know, right?  So all of a sudden, now it's, I guess we're a doctor's office.  Everything is serious now.  It's a doctor's office. 
[01:49:00]  And the lawyers and the babysitters and everyone else, they forgot that this is just a fucking  entertainment program.  It's a fun dopey radio show where we want to fucking give a, honestly, how is anyone going  to get in trouble?  Like, the lawyers are going to have to defend a prostate exam.  Like, how, pick a scenario where, unless, let's talk to Steve, didn't clip his fucking  nails that day.  Right.  Where there's going to be an issue that the lawyers have to step in and defend a prostate 
[01:49:30]  exam.  Right.  I can't figure one out.  No.  And believe me, I'm usually the one that thinks pretty far ahead and goes like, there might  be an issue with this or that or the other thing.  No.  But if, if going into it, you tell everyone, look, I'm going into it.  Well, going into the asshole.  Before you go into the asshole, if you're, if, if you're telling everyone, look, we're  just doing this for fun on the radio, you know, but you know, you might want to go to  your regular doctor to get a real exam because I'm not licensed in New York.  That should be it.  That's it.  That's it.  And you could put it.  That's it.  But, but they're still discussing it. 
[01:50:00]  You could put a sign out front, like, you know, how they have free flu shots out front.  Free prostate exams.  Yeah.  Free prostate for entertainment purposes only.  Once you put a sign on the door, this is for entertainment.  It's like when you're filming.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're, you're, you're covered.  You're covered.  You know, all the gay guys that would just be coming up here.  You're looking at one now.  Company.  Can you imagine that?  Richard B with a mask on.  I know I just showed up. 
[01:50:30]  My doctor, my doctor told me he was given a prostate check and some gay guy got hard when  he was doing it.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  But, uh, so, so, so, and to summarize, it would be like getting jerked off by a fucking  female doctor.  You go in, she starts jerking you off.  It's like, yeah, okay.  Of course.  Yeah.  To summarize.  So, uh, no surprise.  Another one of our benchmark bits.  Now all of a sudden there's problems.  How come you guys can't do it?  It's satellite radio.  We did way more on regular radio at this point. 
[01:51:00]  We did.  Maybe you don't want to do it anymore or you're not allowed, and I don't know why I'm asking  this because maybe I shouldn't be, but how come you don't do the 50 gallon drum thing?  Oh, 55 gallon drum, yes.  We talked about that last week.  Really?  You're not allowed to do it?  They would never.  No.  Never clear that.  No.  Girls.  Girls fucking.  Girls screaming, you know.  Bikinis.  Who wants to hear that on the radio?  With goop all over them.  Hot girls screaming because they're scared because we're throwing eels into big huge barrels  and balls and cockroaches and everything else.  But what would be the problem with that?  Oh, really, Rich? 
[01:51:30]  Why don't you walk down the hall?  Yeah, talk to the lawyers about it.  They'll explain the problem to the point where you're exhausted and want to kill yourself.  Actually, we have the explanation.  As a lawyer, I would like to tell you, Rich, it's very hard to get crickets to sign the  no indemnity contracts.  We need every insect brought in to sign a contract saying that we will not be held responsible  if a leg breaks off or an antennae or some sort of bug-type problem.  I think to get around it, and you could do it without letting them know, do the 54-gallon 
[01:52:00]  drum challenge.  It's completely different.  It's a gallon less, guys.  You know, and I know we joked out we run out of here at 10, but we do.  But the real reason we run out of here at 10, and I'll be honest with everyone today,  there's a bunch of zombies outside this studio, and they're trying to bite us.  Like, I'm not joking.  Like, there's a creative thing that is happening every day on this show, and as soon as you  leave this studio, they start sucking the creativity out of you with their meetings 
[01:52:30]  and their talks, and we have to talk to a lawyer about this, and they're just killing  everything.  So the sooner we can get out of here without running into any of these zombie-type people,  the better we are for the show.  And that is not going for jokes or nothing.  That is the God's honest truth at this point.  If a zombie bites you, it's over.  Your sense of humor goes away, and you just become a zombie.  Let me show you the marks.  We used to love hanging out at radio stations.  Loved it. 
[01:53:00]  We haven't been...  You know we have an office down this hall?  Well, I haven't sat in that office in...  We have an office?  Exactly.  We haven't sat in that office in well over a year and a half.  They could give it to someone else.  I'm not ever going to sit there.  I got a computer down there I've never even turned on.  And we used to love hanging out in our office before the show, after the show, hanging out,  there's creativity going on.  Not this place, man.  You've got guys that dress up for casual Fridays, and it's obvious they're dressing up for casual  Fridays, you know?  It really is obvious. 
[01:53:30]  Everything is so calculated, and it's like, if we could get to 10 and to the elevator without  anyone touching us, that's a great day for everybody involved, including the listeners.  Because they just suck the energy out of you with the bullshit.  Dr. Steve now needs a New York State medical license to do a silly bit we've been doing  for years.  For years.  Makes no sense.  And I don't even know what the problem is with, what the hell is that, so I don't even  know if we should continue promoting it, because I didn't write the guy back, because  I can't do that to myself anymore. 
[01:54:00]  I can't be frustrated and pissed off because another guy is ruining the creative process  of this show.  And I'm sure he's answering to people, so maybe I shouldn't even blame him totally.  But he's the messenger.  You've got to always beat up the messenger.  I don't care what people say.  You always beat up the messenger, because you can't find the other guy.  Don't kill the messenger, right?  You've got to kill the messenger.  Yeah, that's me.  28 days later, you're just running out, running away from management. 
[01:54:30]  That's how we flee every day.  If you've seen 28 days.  There's a zombie on fire chasing a guy that could very easily be me.  Yeah, just run to the elevator.  Just run.  Run!  So maybe somebody could talk to these guys and see if there's a problem with what the  hell is that, because I can't email these guys back.  I can't call them back.  I just can't do it anymore.  Just can't do it.  It ain't happening.  It ain't happening, man.  Damn it if you do, damn it if you don't.  I always say that. 
[01:55:00]  You know, I thought when you pay for this type of service, you're allowed, well, I mean,  you don't have to listen, or you don't have to buy it, and when you do buy it, you have  to deal with the fact that it's a little risky, and that's what I thought cable was, you know,  HBO and stuff like that.  I mean, in all fairness, we are still doing risky stuff that you can't do on regular radio,  but, I mean, I just thought we'd be able to do a lot more than we're doing, is how I 
[01:55:30]  would answer that.  Yeah, I don't know how...  And I'm not doing the, you know, I'm not, that's not the company line.  That's exactly how I feel.  We still do edgy stuff, but a lot of the stuff we used to do, we just can't even do here.  It's mind-boggling.  And I've talked about it.  The lawyers, they just overthink everything, and they find ways why we shouldn't be doing  bits instead of figuring out ways to make them work.  Like, this prostate thing is a no-brainer if you're telling people going into it, it's 
[01:56:00]  an entertaining show, and, you know, we're just doing it for entertainment purposes.  What could possibly be the problem after that?  But they never go in there and battle the lawyers.  Like, even in the old days at NEW, Ken Stevens would, you know, go to bat for us.  Oh, hell yeah.  He'd go in there and say, you know, talk to the lawyers and sit them down and be like,  this, the lawyers say something, and the only thing they do is come back to us and go,  well, the lawyer said no. 
[01:56:30]  It's like, no, you're supposed to go in there and duke it out with them and put our point  across.  Especially the biggest mistake, it was either Gary himself or someone who introduced Gary  to us.  One of the first things that was said is, this is the guy that knows how to talk to these  lawyers.  Yeah.  At least be honest and say, look, we have no clue what to say to the lawyers.  They'll win every time.  And then we'll go, okay.  They pretty much have won every time since I was told that this guy knows how to talk  to the lawyers and get things done.  And I question them. 
[01:57:00]  Like, really?  What's your experience with this type of radio?  There's only a few of these shows.  Did you work for another one of these type shows?  I don't think so.  Well, what's less aggravation?  Dealing with them or are you just guys going straight to the lawyers?  I mean...  I don't even know what they look like.  They hide most of the time.  They've got big noses.  No, because they're not radio guys.  Like a propaganda poster from 1938.  The biggest problem is they're not radio guys.  They don't care.  Their success doesn't...  Oh, yeah.  It has nothing to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  Why would they? 
[01:57:30]  Well, don't they have entertainment lawyers that they use?  I don't know.  They don't use entertainment lawyers?  I don't know.  No, they use liability lawyers and stuff.  It has nothing to do with entertainment.  Well, let's just say...  Why would satellite radio have anything to do with entertainment?  But wouldn't that be the lawyer you think you would go with,  with entertainment lawyers that would know?  No.  No?  I don't know.  I don't know that world, to be honest with you.  They're like, we have to protect,  and then we don't even know what they're protecting.  We made the mistake when we went back to regular radio.  We were like, holy shit, has this world changed, right? 
[01:58:00]  And so me and Ann were sort of in a panic situation.  So we actually agreed to sit down with the lawyers to explain to them,  look, you hired us for these guys that did all this stuff.  We assumed when you hired us to go back to regular radio,  we were going to be doing our stuff.  We had to reinvent ourselves, like, quickly.  And some people say it didn't work out.  I would argue that point with people, but whatever.  Whatever.  If you think we fucking...  I loved it when you guys went over there.  If you think we totally sucked and fucked it up, whatever.  No. 
[01:58:30]  But I could easily argue that point with anyone.  But me and Ann were like, holy shit,  we can't do anything that the listeners are expecting  now that we're back on regular radio for the first time  in whatever it would be, four years.  So we actually sat down with the lawyers.  We went and had a lawyer meeting.  Remember, Ann?  They flew up from Washington and everything.  We're like, okay, they're going to see it our way.  And we basically said, guys,  you've got to figure out ways that we can get this stuff done.  We're suffocating here. 
[01:59:00]  And the whole meeting,  and this is why I'll never meet with another lawyer in my life  as far as this stuff goes,  the whole meeting was about why we can't do everything.  I'm like, I already knew that.  I thought this meeting was going to be about  trying to figure out how we could get things done.  Remember that, Ann?  Yep.  And we just sat there like, holy shit,  they don't want to listen to us.  They didn't want to listen to us at all.  They're explaining to the PC this and this  and blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah, blah.  I'm like, you could have just emailed me this.  I thought we were meeting to try to figure shit out. 
[01:59:30]  They had no interest at all  because it has nothing to do with their livelihood.  They don't give a fuck if you failed on regular radio.  Guess what?  They still have jobs over there.  They still have jobs.  So in the end, it didn't matter to them.  In entertainment especially,  no keeps their jobs.  When they say no,  they're not going to get fired.  When you say yes,  why can't somebody wake up  and realize that is hurting the product in the end?  I mean, look at regular radio.  If it didn't hurt the product, please.  I mean, radio shows aren't allowed to do anything anymore. 
[02:00:00]  So they hurt the product.  And now the value of these radio companies  are just in the shitter.  If they're turning any profit,  then they think we're doing something right.  Because you look at some networks on television,  you're going,  how the hell do they have so many bad shows?  Because the good ones  are making them turn a profit.  So they really don't care.  And the bottom line is,  hey, we're making a profit.  So, you know,  it's like people don't understand.  You think like as a comic too, 
[02:00:30]  oh, you just go on stage.  Now you're dealing with clubs that don't advertise.  They want you to,  you know,  you got to do 400 radio shows on the road.  You got to,  can you post it?  Can you do this?  Can you do,  hey, why don't you start to advertise?  It's your fucking club.  Oh.  What?  It's like Nicky Negative.  You can't go in  and just be creative  like you're supposed to.  You know what I'm saying?  You just want to be creative.  What?  What?  What?  You know,  I always work so much better 
[02:01:00]  with other comics.  I need that sound clip  when Rich talks.  What's that?  What?  What?  It was a great point, Rich.  Thank you.  No, I make that.  Dr. Steve, what's going on?  Oh, it's Dr. Steve.  No, I was distracted  because I saw Dr. Steve on the phone.  Dr. Steve.  I have a solution  to this problem.  When I come up on Friday,  we could just talk.  Why?  Is there other issues  I don't know about?  No, no, no.  We could just talk.  Are we allowed to do  what the hell is that? 
[02:01:30]  What are the stipulations  with what the hell is that?  Does anyone know?  No, I don't have.  No one's talked to me  about that.  And, you know,  in all fairness  to the one I mentioned  in the email,  I wasn't trying to throw him  under the bus.  He actually was.  No, you wrote.  He came to me.  You wrote.  Hold on, hold on.  Just so people know.  You wrote me.  You didn't know  I was going to read that  on the air.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  No, it's okay.  It's fine.  I mean, I stand by everything  that's in there  because it's true.  I mean, they came to me 
[02:02:00]  just asking me  kind of do you have  a solution to this  because, you know,  I don't see one.  Can you talk with  a finger puppet?  I don't know.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.com.  Yeah, Rich Voss.  I'm going to the dermatologist.  I have a solution to  the final one.  All right.  So when you come up on  another Nazi joke.  Jesus Christ.  That's okay.  Enough with them already.  When you come up on Friday,  we'll just talk, I guess.  Yeah.  Wow.  I mean, why bother? 
[02:02:30]  Well, Jersey Shore's  been interesting this year.  Sounds great.  All right, sir.  I am going to get  my New York medical license.  Here's the thing.  Four years ago,  I asked if I needed  to get one,  and I was told,  no, don't worry about it.  It's just a bunch of guys  goofing around.  So I never pursued it.  So it wasn't a problem.  I would have, you know,  had one if anybody  had ever told me  it was an issue.  And what's the problem?  Like, now, I don't know. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  You call our show  and you do your own show,  Weird Medicine,  which is a terrific show  and you're going to be  live this Saturday.  Yes.  You're diagnosing people  on a radio show.  What is,  why is that okay?  Dude.  Because you're only licensed  in Tennessee,  so all the people  calling from everywhere else,  wouldn't that be a problem?  Yeah, you know,  doctors have been doing that  for years on the radio.  We're just the first  to do it in an uncensored.  It's just another example  of lawyers just overthinking 
[02:03:30]  what possibly could go wrong.  You know,  we always run a disclaimer  that says we're not  your medical provider.  That's all you have to do.  That's all you gotta do.  That's it.  You even have people sign it  if you have to.  Yep.  Fucking go to work  on a dumb fucking form  that they have to sign.  This is for entertainment  purposes only.  Yep.  That's what I say.  Holy shit.  Enough already.  I'm amazed  they have doctors  in Tennessee.  All right,  Dr. Steve,  thank you.  Good one,  Rich.  We'll see you  Thursday or Friday.  All right,  brother?  See you Friday. 
[02:04:00]  Okay, bye.  Good, man.  So that's the update  there, Anthony.  I thought that would be  quite interesting  for everybody  that we now  basically  can't do  our prostate bit.  It's typical.  He doesn't have  a New York State  medical license.  It's typical.  All right,  so can we  change the bit  to how many  fucking fingers  Dr. Steve  could shove up  asses in one day?  Let's do that.  Has nothing  to do with  the prostate.  I don't know,  and it's not  a doctor thing  or anything.  Yeah, it's a tribute 
[02:04:30]  to Caligula.  How many fists?  No, we should do.  We line up 20 guys.  You like to gamble.  I like gambling  on silly stuff,  and then we have  Dr. Steve,  he has to shove  his fingers up  the 20 guys' asses  or until he comes out  with a little shitty  on his fingers.  Like the Wonderama  snake can game.  Back in the old days.  Or you could do  an over-under  and see how many  people go, ooh.  No, but the bet  would be where we  guess how many guys  he's able to accomplish  this before he comes  out with a little  shitty on his fingers. 
[02:05:00]  A little cocky.  Yeah, but that's no good  because if you put  a hundred down  on that, Ed,  how great would it be?  I'd put a hundred down.  And then we study  the guys coming in  and go, oh,  I think the seventh  guy's going to be  a problem when Dr. Steve  has his fingers  on his ass.  You call it the brown jack.  No, that's not a good bet  because if he comes out  with poo on the first one,  so you've got to bet  an over-under  out of like 20 guys  how many of them smile  or how many of them  go, ooh.  Oh, you want a bunch  of different bets.  Well, because you've got 
[02:05:30]  to get through all 20.  If he comes out  with crap on his table.  Yeah, if he comes out,  you've got it all over  the place.  I've got him down  on a hard eight.  Who could talk  to the babysitters today?  I want to change the bit  to Opie and Anthony's  craps.  Craps.  We're playing craps  on Friday.  He's gambling.  Who could talk to them?  Shooting craps.  Really?  If you want me to do it.  You guys want to play  paper, rock, scissor  to figure out  who has to go talk  to them? 
[02:06:00]  I'm serious.  Go down the hall  or E-Rock,  get off the fucking board  because you seem  to be the good  corporate boy  and go talk  to one of the babysitters  and say that Opie  and Anthony  want to do craps  on Friday instead.  It has nothing to do  with a medical license.  I want to do crap  right now.  Jesus, Rich.  Oh, my God.  Rich is really  stepping in for Jimmy today.  I know.  I got nothing today,  but I came out strong.  Oh, you're good.  Rich is just not  I'm in with a fart.  It's like a Jimmy.  Jimmy loves doing that.  Can we find out? 
[02:06:30]  Makes me miss him.  Can you guys quit  talking about  like he's not here anymore?  It's just,  oh, Jimmy.  He hasn't been here  in a week.  Where's he been?  It's been a while.  I think he'll be back Wednesday.  It's been fucking tearing up.  Where's he been?  L.A., right?  Places you're not  going to be anytime soon.  Oh, TV.  That's okay.  In a gay porn booth.  We said places  you wouldn't be.  He's going to be  back Wednesday. 
[02:07:00]  He's doing Leno stuff.  He's all over the place.  Being a star.  A big star.  Probably looking at  houses out there  if I know Jimmy.  All right.  We're going to take a break,  but E-Rock's going to  see if we can play  craps with Dr. Steve  on Friday.  With real betting, man.  How great would that be?  It would be fantastic.  That would be great, man.  I'm going to call you guys  Friday from Bananas,  Friday night,  to see how it went.  Is that where you're  playing this weekend?  Oh, yeah.  I'm in Hasbro Heights.  Yes.  In Jersey.  And there's a lot of  O&A people in this area. 
[02:07:30]  So, all right.  You know when you see  Voss, and you guys see me,  you've never seen  the same show twice.  Ever.  Ever.  No, no.  You see some of the  same material.  But it's always new material.  Like that whole bit.  Like he doesn't.  That was back in the  NEW days.  All right.  Enough with that bullshit.  You're a writing machine.  I'm a fucking machine.  Enough already.  And when it comes to  crowd work, just stop.  Stop already?  No one better.  No one better.  All right, Dan,  we're going to do some  Jacktober after the break.  Jacktober.  And do we care about  what Rick Sanchez said?  He finally apologized.  I'd like to hear his 
[02:08:00]  dumb apology.  All right, after the break.  Of course, he's a, you know.  Oh, you're a Jew.  Star David he's got there.  He's from the tribe.  Diamonds.  Wow, where'd you get that?  Where'd I get it?  It's Subway.  It came with chips and cookie.  I got the whole.  That is a nice Jew bling  you got there.  Are you a proud Jew?  Well, I mean,  I played golf on Yom Kippur,  but.  Oh, really?  Yom Kippur.  Yom Kippur, whatever.  Whatever they call it.  Whatever, you know.  That is pretty cool, though. 
[02:08:30]  Is it real like diamonds in there?  Yeah, yeah.  I got it from Patrice.  No.  No, I bought it.  I was just going to say.  All right, so you care  about the Rick Sanchez thing,  so we'll get into that next, Rich.  All right?  Yeah.  And a little Jacktober, too.  Stay there.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Is someone getting the best?  The best.  The best.  The best of you.  Is someone getting the best?  The best.  Why that look, Anthony? 
[02:09:00]  Oh, because Corey Feldman is on Channel 5 here,  the Fox station.  We passed on him.  We're promoting The Lost Boys, The Thirst.  What's that?  I guess a sequel to The Lost Boys.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a live, interactive experience,  and I've been working very closely with people  at Live Nation and Warner Brothers,  and we're working on this event, 
[02:09:30]  which is...  Where'd he fly in from obscurity?  Terrible.  Hey, give me that other thing.  Please.  I don't know what I've seen anymore.  Why?  Oh, you want to see some more later?  Oh, my God.  Because I want you...  You're a panicking fucking lunatic.  You're exhausting.  That's what my wife says.  You are exhausting.  What gave you the impression we didn't want to see anymore?  Because I want you to sit and concentrate on it,  you know, 
[02:10:00]  and...  And what?  And get, you know, the full effect.  You know, there's a lot of things going on here.  You've got lawyers, Dr. Steve...  You didn't film Citizen Kane play the fucking thing,  and we'll give you our...  What's wrong with you?  Now we've got to explain.  We're doing us.  We're making a movie Citizen Colin Kane.  It's where he does my act.  Oh!  Oh, shit.  Really?  No, I like the kid.  I'm just fucking around. 
[02:10:30]  No, Rich brought in a very rough copy of the documentary  he's doing with Bonnie about female comics,  and we were watching during the break  because he was very excited to show us a rough cut of it,  and me and Ann, you were enjoying it, right?  Yeah.  The first couple of minutes were good.  Wasn't that a good opening, though?  I loved it.  Everything was fine,  and then you go to Danny as we come back live,  like, give me that back.  No, I meant take it out so I could hold on.  You're all panicky and paranoid that something's going to...  What?  That we're going to sell it to the Asian market?  What's that?  Is that the only copy there is?  No, that's just a rough... 
[02:11:00]  Why do you have hard drives everywhere?  Why did you need it back?  I don't fucking know.  And then you don't think we're watching properly.  Put it on YouTube.  I'm just going to put it on YouTube.  That would be terrible.  What are you and your girlfriend doing for Halloween?  I have no idea.  Besides trick-or-treating.  Trick-or-treating, yeah.  I can't wait to say that.  Yeah.  No, I kind of...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  But we weren't watching properly?  I need to get into this.  No, Anthony was texting. 
[02:11:30]  And there was a good scene with him in it.  There was a very good scene.  He's being serious, too, Anthony.  What?  It was coming up.  You were texting when we were supposed to be watching this Citizen Kane thing.  I was listening.  Yeah, but you...  Oh, really?  Do you go to a movie with your fucking eyes closed?  You got to see the movie.  Sometimes.  Huh?  Sometimes.  You know, this is...  Don't get on Rich's bad side.  He'll be bringing this up for the next 10 years that you weren't watching properly.  I was looking up.  And then you were texting during...  I was looking up as I was...  During the big unveiling of this Citizen Kane project.  This fucking movie is going to be... 
[02:12:00]  It's going to be...  It's going to...  It's going to turn everything around.  It's so fucking funny.  The shit we filmed over almost a year and a half.  But you don't want us watching anymore because we weren't watching properly.  You're fucking twisted.  I was watching.  I'll watch properly.  You want us to watch properly?  I will.  Right now?  Not right now.  I don't want to do it over the air.  You know, it's a sense.  You don't want the stuff getting out for free like that.  No, fuck no.  Where is this going to go?  What do you mean, where is it going to go?  Like, is it going to go in theaters?  No, we were hoping to sell it at BJ Wholesale outlets. 
[02:12:30]  You know, just have some screens there.  All right, now we're going to do some at our Golf Galaxy.  Rich, now you know exactly how we feel when you talk.  Okay.  See that feeling you got?  That's it.  No, yeah.  We're going to go for a theatrical release.  Of course you are.  Of course you are.  And with the celebrities we have in it and how funny it is.  Who's in this documentary?  Or as Bonnie said, a coccument.  No, we're not using that.  That's getting fucking cut.  Who's in it?  Yeah.  Well, so far, am I allowed, should I say, do you think, or what do you think? 
[02:13:00]  You know, tease a couple of them.  A couple of the big stars.  I'll give first Chris, Dane, Wanda, Sarah, Joy, Rosie, Rita, Jim, Colin, John.  That's impressive, but I need to know the last names.  It could be fucking Dane Johnson.  It could be Chris Riley.  I mean.  Chris Riley's funny, man.  You just said some impressive first names.  Everyone you think of, that's who it is. 
[02:13:30]  Wanda Williams.  Who else?  Everyone you think.  I can say the names, sure, and it doesn't matter.  Fucking Chris Rock, Dane Cook, fucking Wanda Sykes, Sarah Silverman, Lisa Lemonelli,  Artie Lang, Brewer, Colin, Jesus, Joy Behar, Susie Essman, Jeff Ross, Paul Mooney,  Michael Ian Black, Colin Quinn, Maria Bamford, Todd Glass, Andy Kindler, Greg Giraldo, every 
[02:14:00]  fucking body's in it, man.  That's awesome.  Tom Arnold.  Is it the last film Greg Giraldo made?  Can you bill it like that?  I wouldn't do it.  I'm not going to try to.  You know what Colin said at his wake?  We're at the wake last week, and he goes up to speak, and he's going, you know, it's  just, he's saying all this stuff, and we're just, and he was so talented, and I'm just, 
[02:14:30]  we're just so mad that he's gone.  Do you think we'd be this mad at Rich Voss' funeral?  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  I'm getting a shout out at wakes.  Patrice O'Neill.  Patrice is in it.  Patrice, a lot of guys, man.  Good for you.  I'm sorry we weren't watching properly.  I don't know what to tell you about that one.  But the whole thing is, you know, Joe DeRosa is so funny in this movie, it's unbelievable  how fucking funny he is in the movie, the character he plays, which I can't give that 
[02:15:00]  away, but it's so fucking funny.  God damn.  Joe's very good.  He really is a good actor.  He really studied, and he was prepared.  He was so fucking prepared, it was unbelievable.  Bobby Kelly was great.  Just one scene in the movie where Bobby is holding court at the cellar, and he's just  on fire, and he's holding court, then he takes a bite of bread, and he starts choking on it, 
[02:15:30]  and you could see he thinks he's going to die.  His whole life flashes in front of his fucking disgusting humanness.  We're sort of watching it as you talk.  Who did the animations?  That animation?  Yeah.  It is Coke Logic.  Good for him, man.  It's very funny.  We're going to get some more stuff.  I hope you tossed him a couple of bucks.  I'm going to, but he's got more stuff.  Because we never did.  No, I'm going to.  We pay everybody.  No one works for free for the fucking...  Wow.  I saw that we were in this little thing.  Where's my little taste?  No one works for free.  We worked for free. 
[02:16:00]  No, that's not working, what you did.  You guys, first of all...  A typical Jew.  Oh, damn!  That's an explanation for everything.  Give me my fucking money.  I'm not typical.  I'm not successful.  Are you playing it now?  What?  You just said Coke Logic.  You can't play it now because you can't hear it.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  No, we saw the animation.  I'm not playing anything.  Relax.  We just saw it.  Where'd you see it?  Well, it was right on the screen.  People were watching it, I said.  But why would you watch it without sound?  That's what I'm saying. 
[02:16:30]  We're not watching it properly again, Anthony.  Well, how the fuck can you watch it?  It's not a silent movie.  It's not Citizen Kane, you asshole!  But you got me fucking sound, you morons!  I just wanted to watch it to see who was in it.  Yeah.  It's 20 minutes.  You think we got everybody in in the first fucking 20-minute rough cut?  Danny's been just going through it a little bit so we get a good feel because we're talking  about your dumb fucking documentary.  It's not dumb.  Let me explain something.  I'm sorry that Anthony text on the whole thing.  Yeah, okay, but you're watching it now without sound.  So that's okay.  Then we'll see what sounds.  Because this part is really fucking funny right here. 
[02:17:00]  All right, let's put it.  Let's put it.  Huh?  Can I play it on the air?  With this part right here?  Well, get this one from the beginning.  You can play this part from the beginning.  Bonnie's going to kill you.  No, you can play this one.  Let's not do it.  Wait, let me see.  I don't care if you play this part.  Let's see.  Well, I got it.  Let's see.  Holy shit, Anthony.  Are you watching properly?  Yeah, I'm watching properly.  You better.  Wait, hold on.  Before this?  Okay.  Okay.  What are we doing, Rich?  Okay.  You do realize we're doing a national radio show right now. 
[02:17:30]  That's okay.  This is more important.  Yeah, of course.  How do you want us watching, by the way?  Huh?  I'll sit up straight.  What else do I need to do?  A little more.  A little more.  He wants to go forward.  Okay.  From the time he's...  Let's see.  Let's see his part.  See, I mean, it leads into it.  All right.  Hold on.  Wait.  How do we watch this, Rich?  Huh?  How do you want us to watch this?  I don't know.  Yeah.  How should we watch it?  I don't know.  Danny's turning the lights down.  Oh, yeah.  Turn the lights down.  Is that good? 
[02:18:00]  Is the lighting good?  What else do you need?  Watch it like you did the entertainment business when you guys were kicked off the fucking  air.  Okay?  Watch it like that.  Oh!  I don't know what that means, but it was hurtful.  I don't even know if it was.  Be very attentive.  It just got me very confused.  I don't know what you were saying.  My ad-libs aren't really on point today.  I'm kind of tired.  All right, Dan.  I drove eight hours.  You want us to hand in our phones so we don't text or tweet during this?  I'm watching.  You're okay?  Well, you got to tweet.  I mean, I don't know. 
[02:18:30]  Maybe you could tweet.  I get it.  A sunrise, sunset.  No, you tweet a lot.  I like them.  Oh, thanks.  Let's see what this part is.  Damn it.  I'm just explaining to her.  All right, let's go.  This is a...  You got to knock these things out.  You need to reel them in.  You need to be assertive.  You're...  You're...  What do you call it?  Maybe...  Hold on.  Jesus, Rich.  What?  Maybe you could set up what...  Yeah.  You know when, like, real stars go on Leno and all that?  They set up the clip.  We set up the fucking clip.  Why don't you give me time? 
[02:19:00]  All right.  Go back a little.  Again, this part, if we keep this in the movie, I'm explaining...  Oh, now he's panicking.  No.  He went from, you got to see this, to if we keep this in the movie.  Listen, fucking Elliot, exaggeration.  I fucking said...  Wait, first of all...  Did I say you have to watch...  I said, this is a scene we can watch.  How am I exaggerating?  I just repeated what you said.  No.  What I'm saying is, this is a scene, if we keep it in a movie.  Okay? 
[02:19:30]  Go back a little bit again.  You're hoping it's in the movie, because you think it's really good.  No, I don't think it's really good.  I think it's a good scene.  I'm explaining to Bonnie how to do the interviews, how to be an investigative reporter in the scene.  Okay.  Okay, so we're in, and I'm saying, this is what you got to do.  Okay.  Okay.  Asking the tough questions.  Do you Twitter, by the way?  With the unwavering support of my husband.  Look, you got to knock these things out.  You need to reel them in.  You need to be assertive.  You're, what do you call it? 
[02:20:00]  An interviewer.  All right?  It's like sales.  Prospect.  Presentation.  Close.  Boom.  Close the deal.  Get them in, and boom, they let it out.  They, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  You don't get what I'm saying, do you?  Questions.  Questions.  80s.  Talk about the 80s, okay?  The appetizer.  Some soup.  Salad.  Then the main course.  You see what I'm saying?  Then the main course. 
[02:20:30]  You're, you have to be more funny.  Well, step it up, that's all, and be more funny.  You look good.  I see.  Getting ready in the bathroom.  Let me interview the first one just to show you how to do it.  Want to keep watching?  I'll interview her.  You don't want to start off on the wrong foot.  No offense to you, but I'm going to be interviewing them.  Thank you.  I used my connections as a successful stand-up comedian.  Not supposed to be here.  Okay. 
[02:21:00]  No, that's okay.  Kenny's in it.  This movie has everybody we know.  To talk to as many experts in the field of comedy as I could.  You should be talking to, like, a sociologist, because I'm just a fucking drunk.  I'm just a fucking drunk, he said.  Stanhope's great.  See, now, in that one scene, you guys laughed.  Yes.  And we were watching properly, too.  Yeah, and the first scene.  I didn't blink once.  But I'm saying how good this body's fucking genius.  I'm serious. 
[02:21:30]  She really is fucking smart.  Maybe not with her picture life.  Yes, exactly.  I was thinking the same thing.  She fucking, this whole thing's in her head, and the way she's tying this all in.  I mean, I give a lot of, not a lot, I give some input, you know, obviously.  But you caught the funny line in that.  Shut up.  Who is the silent film star again?  Who?  Please say it again.  I didn't hear this one.  Who did I?  This guy's reliable, too. 
[02:22:00]  Who is the silent film star that you referenced?  Buster Keen?  No, Charlie, Charlie Chaplin?  What did he say?  Charlie Chapman.  Charlie Chapman.  Yeah.  Tracy's father.  All the DVD tray is stuck.  Your movie's stuck in the...  That's okay.  I got tons of those.  I'm serious.  What do you mean it's fucking stuck?  He'll get it out.  The DVD is stuck in the tray. 
[02:22:30]  He can't get it out.  Oh, no.  Is it really stuck?  You better leave with that copy.  A lot of people would just fucking put that on the street, Rich.  Don't trust anyone.  That's not a case.  You guys got a nice movie on your hands.  Oh, man.  I'm so fucking excited about this.  I've seen way fucking worse.  And that's rough cut.  Rough cut.  The beginning.  The beginning.  Quick cuts.  Artie was fucking funny up front, man.  A lot of quick cuts.  Oh, you lost Anthony's attention. 
[02:23:00]  He's texting.  That's okay.  He's texting again.  Is that right?  I'm just...  Are you all right with that, though?  What's that?  Are you all right with that?  Yeah, we're done watching.  But that one scene, how funny.  Talk about the 80s, huh?  Strong with the 80s.  Strong stuff, Rich.  Strong.  Strong.  That was good.  Really good.  Does it look good?  It looks very good, yeah.  Yeah, we can't fuck you up too much.  No, you can smash it because it's a rough cut.  Who directed it?  No, it looks good.  Who directed?  Who directed it?  Yeah.  Bonnie's doing all...  Because I like the way it went back and forth like that. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  The cuts and stuff are good.  The editing's good.  Brewer's guy is doing it.  Telling the guy, the Brewer's guy.  Yep.  Well, Bonnie's on top of him the whole time.  Oh, Jesus.  That's a problem.  Really?  What's that about?  Is she going to have a kid?  See what I mean?  What?  Of course.  You lob it in.  What the fuck is Danny under the desk?  You got the fuck...  He's trying to get your DVD out.  Oh, I thought he was trying to get a raise. 
[02:24:00]  Get it?  Get it?  Yeah, I got it.  That's what Tom Poppins said my tagline is going to be.  What?  Get it?  Get it?  Get it?  Get it?  You should be the get it comic.  Yeah.  That would be great.  Oh, we were at Bobby's party last week.  It was a small surprise party.  It was going to be a big thing.  Wait, I got an email that was canceled.  It was.  So we just had dinner for him.  Yeah, I had an Evite.  I had an Evite, too.  What happened?  Why didn't we get invited to the small gathering? 
[02:24:30]  What's that?  You did?  How come you didn't show up?  I didn't get invited to the small gathering.  I got an email saying everything was canceled because of the Greg Girald.  Yeah, maybe it was the last minute put together that day.  I don't fucking know.  Anyhow.  Wow, someone's in trouble.  Huh?  We should have been there for the small get together.  Yeah.  Oh.  And we're sitting in there.  And me, Patrice, Keith, and Colin at one table, and Bonnie, and everything.  And Bobby's personal appearance agent, Matt Frost. 
[02:25:00]  Frosty, right.  In my opinion, is a jackass.  It's my opinion.  Okay.  Okay, so I can't be sued for my opinion.  Why is it your opinion that he's a jackass?  Because when I was with him, he didn't get me anything.  But it's part me.  I'm quite the bridge burner around this fucking comedy community.  Obviously.  And all of a sudden, we're sitting here.  Oh, Jesus.  And you hear fucking boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  And he comes tumbling down the stairs. 
[02:25:30]  He fell?  Yes.  And Bonnie turns to me and says, I willed that.  I can't say, Bonnie's great.  Fucking Bonnie.  But he came down the stairs and didn't drop a drip of his beer.  Wow, that's talented.  The DVD tray is officially stuck.  Someone stick it.  He's trying.  He's prying it open and scratching your disc up at the same time.  Voss, we could care less about the Rick Sanchez situation, but you being a Jew and all, it seemed like you got excited about this. 
[02:26:00]  Well, he apologized, I guess, for his anti-Semitic comments.  But going into it, why are you excited about this whole thing?  Well, two things.  I don't want to see any of these guys getting fired, whether I agree or disagree with what they do.  Man.  Well, here's the thing.  And I said this to Anthony before.  Well, one, the apology, that's all bullshit because people only apologize.  No one apologizes for real.  For real, because if you're saying it, there's years and years of buildup, and all of a sudden you're going to turn around. 
[02:26:30]  You're going to be sorry?  You're right.  And buildup?  What did he say?  He barely said anything, Rich.  Well, whatever.  He's going, no, when he's saying.  He had a couple opinions on Pete Dominick's show.  We played the audio, and we were like, he got fired for this.  We couldn't believe it.  Wait, there's two ways to say a thing.  The Jews are successful, and they have achieved high status in running the entertainment business, or Jews run the business.  There's a difference in tones and how you say things. 
[02:27:00]  But wait a second.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let's have a conversation.  When so many people have, it's a tagline, basically, the Jews run the entertainment business.  We've all heard it a million fucking times.  You're right, but it's not a positive thing.  Why is it not a positive thing?  I think it would rule.  What's that?  I think it would rule.  Yeah, I know.  But when you have radical minorities or radical anti-Semitic people, you know, like the Farrakhans or the Leonard Jeffries.  How many Farrakhans are there? 
[02:27:30]  And how many Jeffries?  Jeffries are there.  We're not fans of the Brett Favres.  The Tom Brady.  You know, you got your Tom Brady.  You got your Derek Jeter's.  You got your Obama's.  Yeah.  Okay, but see, you don't see it because you're not a Jew, so you don't see the answer.  But wait a second.  Oh, Christ.  Okay.  No, what do you mean, oh, Christ?  You should be defending Rick Sanchez.  No.  Because they're going to come to get you eventually.  They're going to go after comedy clubs eventually.  You're stupid if you don't think so.  Well, I'm not saying I don't disagree. 
[02:28:00]  I definitely agree with freedom of speech.  You don't have to be happy about it, but you should be saying, wow, this guy should not be fired.  Let me get to my point.  I didn't say, you know, not once did I say, should he be fired?  So don't put words on me.  I never said that.  I didn't say he should or shouldn't be fired.  That's another topic.  If you want to get to that, then we'll go to that.  What I'm saying is these people that spew, oh, the Jews run this or run that, and this  is what I put on Twitter last week, how come those same people that are negative towards  the Jews running the media weren't too negative when the Jews got their president elected? 
[02:28:30]  When that media covered up all the bullshit that Obama has done in the past, that same  media that was on their radical left side, they weren't complaining then.  No, they weren't.  Okay.  So you can't pick and choose when to go after the Jew media, okay, if it's not in your favor.  Okay.  Do I think it should be fired?  Fuck no.  Of course not.  Because it's freedom of speech.  Okay.  But the liberals and the conservatives threw Imus under the bus.  Nobody stood up for his freedom of speech, which is basically a big liberal platform. 
[02:29:00]  Okay.  The freedom of speech until you don't want to get involved or it's going to hurt your  career.  Wow.  Okay.  So there are a bunch of fucking hypocrites.  All right.  So if you want to attack the Jews for running the media in a capitalistic society where we  fucking got ahead, I'm sorry that the 3% of us fucking pulled forward and we're running  that.  You know what?  Maybe you start attacking the Italians for running construction or start attacking the 
[02:29:30]  Japanese for running the car business.  What happened?  Okay.  What did I do?  So you know what?  This is a...  Let him go.  He's on a roll.  A capitalistic society.  It's a business.  You know what?  These are the same people too.  It's quite impressive.  These are the same fucking people when they're getting ready to get locked up or praying there's  a Jew there to keep them out of jail or when they're getting ready to have their stomach  cut open to have their intestines fucking removed or their heart surgery, they're praying  to fucking Jews above them.  You know what?  You kind of pissed me off a little though because you're perpetuating a stereotype that 
[02:30:00]  all Italians drive around in escalades and have guns.  No, I...  Well, that's what they're saying.  All Jews run this or run that.  Oh, that's funny.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to cut you off.  No, you didn't.  Okay, so it's...  Well, Rick Sanchez is apologizing.  So you want to hear the audio?  No, fuck no.  I've heard it all.  I want to hear him say I'm sorry.  I want to hear how insincere this is.  We'd love the I'm sorry.  I want to hear how insincere this is.  I thought he went on Pete's show and he was just trying to have a little fun and he got 
[02:30:30]  spanked for it.  I don't think so.  I really don't.  You thought he had an agenda really?  Of course.  Well, his main agenda was to sell books.  That's his main agenda.  But that would be a stupid agenda.  Mine's to burn them.  If he really thought he could get fired for stuff like that, I don't think he's the type  of guy that would go for it.  Listen, people...  It's easy to go after Jews because they're very passive.  There's only three...  You know, it's easy.  People don't really attack the Pope.  You ever hear any of these people attacking the Pope?  Yes.  The Pope's getting attacked a lot. 
[02:31:00]  The Pope always gets attacked.  Your argument would have been better if you said Mohammed.  That's what I meant.  The Pope's good friend Mohammed.  Will you quit cutting me off?  That's the argument a lot of people use.  But the Pope gets the shit beat out of them.  That's why Donahue gets so frustrated and he says, why don't they go after Mohammed  the same way?  Okay, Mohammed.  But Buddha's another one.  No one ever attacks Buddha unless he's petting, drug-sniffing dogs at the airport.  Because he's fat.  So you can see my...  Yeah, I get it.  I got it the seventh time you did it. 
[02:31:30]  Okay.  Jesus.  Yeah, but it's a great little story.  I know it is.  Nothing about petting, drug dogs.  Come on.  I got to keep going back there, Rich.  It's our job.  So you see my point.  And I made a valid point.  Okay?  I love people that are going, Voss is going to fuck this up soon.  Wait for it.  Yeah, just wait for it.  No, I...  My argument's closed.  Here's Rick Sanchez apologizing.  And Rick Sanchez joins us.  Now I know this has not been the easiest week for you, but you're still smiling.  It's tough.  I screwed up, George.  What happened on that radio show? 
[02:32:00]  I was tired.  I'd been working 14-hour days for like two and a half months.  I was doing three shows.  Stupid Jews working to the ball.  The Jews have been working me like a dog.  They offered him two hours.  Really?  Doing three shows.  I was exhausted.  It was right after the air.  My daughter had a softball game I desperately wanted to go to, and I was a little impatient.  Every time after I came from my daughter's basketball game is when I always wanted to drag gay people from behind my car. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, I was exhausted.  Daughter had a game.  I had to check the mail.  I was clipping my nails.  I had a shoelace broke.  Anything else I could come up with because I hate the Jews?  I mean, like this guy's excuses are terrible.  They are the worst.  Like, this is shit people just do.  The best he could have at least said, okay.  He's living a life, basically.  He should have said, a Jew looked at my artwork and said it wasn't good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:33:00]  He's just living his way.  I don't know.  I work hard, then I have to go to my daughter's softball game.  Softball game was terrible.  I'm really sleeping well.  Just described everyone on the planet.  Put gas in the car.  It was terrible.  I don't even know it.  How hard is it?  My tire pressure light came on.  It's been on my mind all day.  I was just thinking, it must have been the Jew.  This guy's fucking just the worst excuses. 
[02:33:30]  We bitch a lot, but we know how easy this job is.  Oh, God, stop it.  We know.  He's got an easy job.  It was rough.  He's got a really easy job.  When my driver was taking me to work this morning, he asked, how was my night?  Oh, God, I hate him because he's, you know, a Jew.  Really, you're going to believe the driver's a Jew?  Oh, yeah, I know, right?  Boy, that was a stretch.  When I was getting my manicure, I had to wait an extra 20 minutes before the gook got to me. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I might as well be, you know, racist all around.  Flashbacks of my drinking and driving days.  Are we allowed to say that word, or now am I in trouble?  I was just trying to go for a joke.  What did you say?  Because he was, you know, the derogatory term for Asians.  Yeah, I apologize for that.  From Southeast Asia.  I certainly have a lot of Asian friends, and I don't want to offend anybody with that.  No offense taken. 
[02:34:30]  I'm fine.  All right, good.  And you're part Asian, so I'm good now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's part Asian.  Of course.  That's right.  Yeah, you're allowed to say that.  And I said some things that I shouldn't have said, and they were wrong.  And not only were they wrong, they were offensive.  And people who were...  He don't believe that shit.  Not at all.  He doesn't believe it was wrong, and he doesn't believe it was offensive.  This is where we get the fake apologies.  I stood online at Starbucks.  I got a coffee. 
[02:35:00]  They made it wrong, and I didn't get the proper change.  Ah, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.  Driving back to my...  Driving back from the Hamptons, there was a traffic jam.  Oh, I got it.  This guy...  Census Bureau sent me four letters.  His excuses are beyond me.  They're the worst.  People who were offended by it, you know, deserved to...  People thought they were anti-Semitic.  Yeah, deserved to know that, first of all, that's not what I meant.  Second of all, I apologize, and it was wrong of me to... 
[02:35:30]  For me to be so careless and so inartful.  But it happened, and I can't take it back, and you know what?  Now I have to stand up and be responsible for it, just like I teach my kids.  It's fucking boring shit.  Just like I teach my kids.  Okay.  You know what?  Every single one of these guys should be able to say whatever the hell they want.  And now he's got to go on an apology tour.  And you know what?  I don't even like the guy, but I don't like what's happening to him at all.  I like that he said that it didn't come out right, like he didn't mean that, yet he's  apologizing for it.  Yeah.  What do you mean? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, what do you mean?  And you know, here's another point, too, when they talk about the Jews running the business,  you know, the film business.  Let me explain something to people that don't realize this, okay?  They have higher-up positions.  You know who runs the entertainment or the film business?  The banks.  Because they're the ones who are financing.  The banks run them all.  The banks.  Now, who runs the banks?  I'll uncover whether it's the banks or the Jews.  Okay.  Where do you think the money's coming from to finance these $200 million movies? 
[02:36:30]  The banks.  Okay.  And investors.  But who?  Who runs the banks?  The Wasp run the banks.  Do they?  Oh, really?  Do you really think the Jews run Chase Manhattan Bank?  The Wasp run.  The Jews weren't even allowed to work.  You're going to get fired for this.  What's that?  You're going to get fired for this.  Who's going to get fired?  You.  How am I going to get fired for it?  You're going to make fun of the Wasps.  You're a comedian.  First of all, I can't get fired from a job I'm not getting paid for.  How am I going to get fired?  Fired from the comedian community.  If Kenny walks in, I'll hit bonus, I guess. 
[02:37:00]  Can we get back to this, Rich?  But you see, I make some...  Yeah, I know.  All right.  No, it's just the whole perception of...  We got it.  We really did.  And I guess the...  I don't know what.  The Greeks run the fucking diamond district?  Diners.  Oh, yeah, right.  Okay.  No, the...  Yeah, but what does that mean?  They run a diamond district.  In every city, there's a diamond district.  It's the Jews? 
[02:37:30]  I don't know.  Did you just say that?  It probably is.  All right.  Let's go back to you.  Rick says there's no minorities hosting new shows.  What the fuck is he?  There's a million of them.  I went in there with a chip on my shoulder.  I was a little bit angry.  And look, I will be honest with you, and I hope you don't mind my saying this, but I'm  just going to go ahead and say it.  But if you look at the landscape right now in our media, in prime time, there's not  a single Hispanic.  There's not a single African American. 
[02:38:00]  Every newscast is done by a black and a Hispanic.  And blacks everywhere.  An Asian, a black, and a Hispanic on almost every newscast.  What is he talking about?  Is he talking about CNN and MSNBC and all that?  What is he talking about?  Every commercial is an Asian, a black, and a white person.  And they're making fun of the white person.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're all having fun together.  I think he's talking about hosting news shows.  But hosting news shows, wouldn't that be your local news?  Is he talking about news shows?  I think so, yeah. 
[02:38:30]  I'll go back a little.  He said prime time.  I thought he was talking about TV shows.  Did he say prime time?  Media.  In prime time, there's not a single Hispanic.  There's not a single African American.  In prime time, hosting a prime time show in the United States.  2020.  Which is 2020.  I'm talking about newscast.  That's just 2020.  Yeah, yeah.  Only 2020, you know, the show that's been on forever.  Yeah, he proved you wrong right there, Rich.  In the United States.  2020.  He proved you wrong?  Which is 2020.  I'm talking about newscasts. 
[02:39:00]  In cable news.  In cable news?  That's true.  That's fair.  I'm referring to cable newscasts, straight newscasts, not magazine shows.  There's not a single Hispanic, a single Asian American, or a single American.  Connie Chung did have a show at CNN.  There's a lot of people who've had shows a little bit in the past.  I'm talking about right now, though, George.  And I think it's significant, you know, that we do have some representatives.  Well, it's interesting the way you put that.  No.  I was wrong to say that. 
[02:39:30]  And I was wrong to scapegoat Jon Stewart.  Wow, he's got a chip on his shoulders.  He certainly does.  What the fuck?  A corn chip.  That's right.  I like blue chips.  Blue chips, Rich?  Yeah, they're pretty good.  Fritos?  In this society.  How bad do you want Fritos right now?  Oh, I hate Fritos.  You didn't like the Fritos?  Ah, they smell like feet.  Disgusting.  Oh, what, Rich?  I like Doritos.  In this society where.  Society!  In a capitalistic society. 
[02:40:00]  There's a, like.  And Magic Johnson's smart because.  He has AIDS.  He got AIDS.  How smart could he be?  How smart is that?  How he opened his own theaters in urban areas.  Okay, there's enough influential minorities where they could start their own distribution  companies, their own movie theaters.  They do.  With cocaine.  No.  Do you see?  It's not a closed business.  Anybody else can start their own, you know.  Like Magic Johnson starting the movie theaters. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  So you say, like, the black community should get together and just start doing business amongst  themselves.  Yeah, they can make their own.  There's enough influential black people.  Oprah does it.  She's smart.  She has her own networks.  Yeah.  You know.  So.  Why?  But she hires white people left and right.  What I'm saying is.  What are you talking about?  I'm telling you what I'm talking about.  I'm so confused.  Okay, what I'm talking about is the Jews that sit together and build their own empires,  whether it be the diamond district, you said, or the entertainment.  Or pyramids.  What's stopping anybody else from doing it? 
[02:41:00]  What's stopping?  Exactly.  I've said that many, many times.  You know.  I say it at home all the time.  It's like the liberal mentality.  We'll give you the fish.  Not us.  We'll give you the pole.  I heard that on the radio yesterday.  Well, I like that.  Are you just repeating something you heard on the radio?  Well, that's what you do in life anyhow.  You only repeat what you've heard.  Give a man a fish he eats for a day.  Teach a man a fish.  That's the pole part.  Yeah.  No, are you kidding me?  I teach him a fish, right, Rich?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Of course I heard it.  That's what you learn. 
[02:41:30]  I hear you.  Someone tells you something, you learn it, and you fucking repeat it.  Okay?  A penny saved is a penny earned.  What's that?  I don't know.  A penny saved is a penny earned?  Figured your ears perked up.  And a little more audio from this rich, uh, who is it, Rick?  Rick Sanchez.  Yes, Rick Sanchez.  And when I called John Monday and I said, why do you always pick on me?  He said, because you're the one I like.  You're the one I like.  I mean, the guy's been so good.  You gave him some material getting tasered.  Well, but a lot of this stuff, though, it's like, he'll criticize. 
[02:42:00]  And here's where I think there's an equalization issue that comes in from time to time that  it bothered me.  And again, I'm not trying to make excuses, but I was at, from time to time, let me give  you an example.  How many feet and how many inches are in 10 meters?  How many feet and how many inches are in 10 meters?  What is it, uh, 330 feet?  No, in 10 meters.  Yeah.  It would be 10 meters is like three, it's like 11 or something.  What is this, our show?  And so we come out.  What the fuck is he talking about?  What are they just going to our show?  Yeah, really?  It's because he knows about, oh. 
[02:42:30]  What is he talking about?  I don't know.  Who cares?  We don't use meters in America.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Piece of shit.  Now, not, not, not with those pay boxes.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You should have done that in the chip voice.  Or something, right?  And so we come out.  Anyway, exactly.  I, I, I got confused.  Well, one time I said on television that I didn't know how many feet and inches were in  10 meters.  And I was, uh, part of John Stewart's skit where he had the whole audience laughing, saying, 
[02:43:00]  look how stupid Rick Sanchez is.  So, it's almost like if he does a piece on Glenn Beck calling the president a communist,  then he has to do a piece on somebody at CNN, and I'm the one he chooses, and then he does  that.  And I was feeling like, you know, is that really fair, and why is it always me?  Oh, oh, yeah!  Boo!  It's the Jew!  The Jew is getting, Mickey's making fun of me!  Shut up!  John Stewart has made fun of everybody at CNN, right? 
[02:43:30]  How fucking liberals have trashed Bush.  They did, what are you kidding me?  The Sarah Palin skits on fucking Saturday Night Live?  Are you kidding?  And they were great, too.  She was fucking good at it.  But they slammed her.  They slammed her.  Yeah, they slammed her, and she was dead on point, Tina Fey, with it.  So the way they treat the right Bushes, Hitler, Bushes, that,  if any of them called Barack Idi Amin, they'd be fucking done the next day. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, we'll find out, and hopefully you're right.  Idi Amin?  You know what I'm saying.  Are you saying it, Rich?  No, not at all.  I like the guy.  Well, you just said it.  I said if someone else said it.  I didn't say it, okay?  But it came out of your head.  Maybe you do need the lawyers here, because I have a little bit of law background in my, uh...  Well, do you?  None.  None.  Here's the final clip, Anthony, Rick.  He says, not now, but maybe someday.  Would you go back?  Absolutely.  CNN is a wonderful, wonderful organization that treated me well and took care of my family, 
[02:44:30]  and I owe them loyalty, because they've been good to me.  CNN didn't screw up.  Rick Sanchez screwed up.  Rick Sanchez wasn't artful.  Rick Sanchez said, then, this may have been offensive.  Rick Sanchez unjustly accused Jon Stewart of being something he's not.  I learned later that he's the classiest guy in the world when I called him, and I'm the  one who needs to be in trouble.  And if CNN ever takes me back, I'd be happy to go back.  You're a stand-up guy to come out. 
[02:45:00]  Rick Sanchez likes Elaine.  Rick Sanchez would like to date Elaine.  This fucking was like a political fucking advertisement.  Rick Sanchez is tired from going to his daughter's softball game.  Rick Sanchez knew Jon Stewart when he took my collect call.  Rick Sanchez has some insecurities there.  He thinks Jon Stewart's going after just him, and that's why he took the shot at Jon Stewart,  I guess.  No, but he took the shot at how they run CNN, the Jews, and no one else. 
[02:45:30]  So what he's saying is the Jews aren't hiring minorities to run these networks.  They hired him.  Isn't that good enough for him?  I know.  You know what?  He's a Hispanic that got some nice prime time on CNN.  They hired him.  End of argument.  What, he's special?  And didn't they offer him, like, his own two hours?  And what about Geraldo?  What is he talking about?  Doesn't Geraldo still have a show hit?  Yes, he does.  That wasn't brought up in the discussion. 
[02:46:00]  No.  Geraldo's a minority.  He's been on TV since I was born, I think.  It's proportionate, he's probably saying.  Whatever.  But, you know, TV isn't, what do you call it, affirmative action.  And it's somebody's business.  We're going to take a break.  Bananas.  Hasbro Heights, New Jersey.  Rich Voss will be there Friday and two shows Saturday.  Right, Rich?  Yes.  We've got to cut you off because we've got to get into Jacktober.  We're running out of show.  Jacktober. 
[02:46:30]  And Rich Voss on Twitter.  Did I make that?  Yeah.  You did good, Rich.  Did I make my point?  Yeah, I think you did.  Were we listening properly?  Yeah, it was good listening.  You were listening properly?  Yeah, now I'm going to be stuck in the play or something.  See what I mean?  See what I'm saying?  It's fucking stuck.  I know, you're panicking, right?  Not at all.  You need that copy back, don't you?  Not at all.  All right.  Jacktober, after the break, Ed?  Yes, please.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:47:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Anthony Show.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Opie and Anthony.  Rich Voss doing a great job for us today.  Anything we forgot, Ed, before we get into Jacktober?  All I'm fixated on is Jacktober.  Okay.  Actually, quickly, I also want to mention Jim Norton.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at Foxwoods Casino, where he will be playing the comedy club. 
[02:47:30]  I will be playing the high roller table.  Nice.  So, come down, say hi, see Jimmy, and leave me the fuck alone, because I'm going to be very busy trying to take their money.  You're going to be gambling.  Yay!  I got to go to a wedding, so I won't be joining you boys.  Damn!  You go to a lot of weddings.  No.  I got a younger wife, and that's the age.  That's what it is. 
[02:48:00]  She's in the age.  All her friends.  She's in that age group, man.  I lived through that, where it's a wedding every weekend, and now I'm back in that world.  Oh, jeez.  This one's actually one of the ones that I do care about and would go to.  But then there is absolutely a bunch where I'm like, holy shit.  Yeah, I've been to a lot of weddings this year.  Let's play golf Wednesday.  All right, let's do that.  Get your father-in-law.  I'll teach him a lesson again.  Will you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who are we featuring on Jack Tuber? 
[02:48:30]  I don't know.  Where's Sam?  I don't know, but...  Anthony, really fast.  Brett Favre.  Brett Favre.  Now they're saying he might have hit on the Jets team masseuse.  The masseuse?  I hope it was a woman.  They're saying that he might have done that as well.  Did you see Brett Favre's penis picture?  No.  They have a picture of it?  It's sad.  Supposedly, yeah.  What do you mean?  It's hard or soft? 
[02:49:00]  We don't know.  He was trying to get it plump, so he's squeezing the base.  Yeah, he's pulling down, like giving his penis a facelift to make it look like it's harder  than it is.  Yeah.  And people are saying that it looks small because he has huge hands.  We're just saying he's got a small penis.  I don't know.  I don't think it could be that small if he's going to put it out there to some girl.  You know what I mean?  When it gets hard, it's probably fucking nice.  Maybe he thinks it's big.  Is that me?  Oh.  Oh, you got it.  Oh, good.  I don't give a fuck if the whole place breaks down now. 
[02:49:30]  You got your DVD back.  Thank you.  Danny's been working on it for 20 minutes.  I didn't hear those things.  Thank you, Danny.  You sure, Danny?  Thank you.  Was it a proper thank you?  Yes, it was very nice.  Yes, thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Gatsby.  The hat.  Oh.  Oh, okay, good.  I have a couple.  I bet you he has a nice...  You don't send pictures of a small dick to anybody.  You want to see his dick?  Huh?  You want to see his dick?  If you turn the lights down, yes, I would love to.  And I hopefully threw a hole in that wall. 
[02:50:00]  That's the only way.  Yeah, I want to see it.  Where's his dick?  We've all saw it.  We were checking it out.  How did you see it?  Because it's everywhere.  You know what?  If you fuck a celebrity and you're a celebrity and you do this, you have to kill them.  We don't know if they had sex.  You have to kill them?  Yes.  I don't think they had sex.  If you're a celebrity, fucking fuck.  I don't think anything happened between these two.  She was not really interested in Brett Favre.  But then she decided, but I might as well ruin his life.  That's what I'm getting at. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  I think.  I got you.  She wasn't into him.  Of course, you know, maybe he shouldn't have sent the cockpit.  Whatever.  He also left voicemails.  She was not into him at all, but decided, I might as well ruin his life, though.  Well, there's ways you can look at it.  She could have said, leave me alone.  Or she also could have let him on.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know the whole story.  Well, where's the picture?  I don't know the whole story.  Jesus.  Are computers down?  Yeah, we're fucked for today.  All the computers? 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  All the computers.  This whole place is like a meltdown.  Yeah, no shit.  Holy fuck.  This reminds me of the millennium.  What is that?  Remember that?  Y2K.  Are you talking about?  A big conspiracy.  Are you talking about Y2K?  Yeah.  Okay.  I wasn't talking about the hotel in New York.  Honestly, I don't remember that because nothing happened. 
[02:51:30]  Nothing.  Yes, you did.  It was a bust.  400 bucks out of the bank.  You did, right?  It's all life savings.  I was working Carolines that night, and I filled a backpack with four cartons of cigarettes and everything.  Why?  Did you think you weren't going to be able to get cigarettes after Y2K?  Well, if we got stuck in Carolines in the basement, like a fallout shelter, I wanted to have smokes for a while.  You were worried about smoking?  Fallout shelter, Carolines.  If Y2K happened, you would have a lot more to worry about than having a cigarette. 
[02:52:00]  Cigarettes.  I know.  Who's going to watch the movie?  You wouldn't have time to smoke a cigarette.  You'd be dodging death left and right.  In the middle of Times Square, you're done rioting.  That's where it's all going to begin.  The buildings are blowing up, and I'm dodging them.  Oh, shit.  He did his own joke.  I like it.  So the team of Seuss is claiming Brett Favre hit on her.  It is on her, Anthony.  Well, you can't show me.  Can you draw me it at least?  It's probably as small as your penis. 
[02:52:30]  My dick is normal.  It's nice when it's hard.  It's normal.  When it's soft, I can't.  Have you seen his dick?  I have a picture of it hard.  He always shows pictures of it.  Here's the deal.  When it's hard, it's not gigantic.  It's not small.  It's a little above average.  One girl said to me, she goes, okay, it didn't hurt, but it didn't pop out.  Okay?  Okay?  Okay.  So, she goes, it's average.  Wow.  Is that a compliment, you think?  Yes.  If it popped out, then it's not. 
[02:53:00]  That's really funny.  You know, we had Florentine in here.  Can you do a classic for us?  Because we do have some new listeners, and I think the old listeners would appreciate  the story, too.  I'm going to write it down, because I don't want to give away the punchline.  Uh-huh.  Sorry.  No, that's okay.  Because Florentine told me again, and I laughed like the first time I heard it.  That is a good one.  Oh, I don't know if I...  That's one of my favorites.  Hopefully, I'll remember it.  Oh, you'll remember this one.  Yeah, you'll know that one.  No, I meant how to read. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, with me?  Yeah.  That's a true story.  I know.  Could you tell it again?  Because Florentine was telling me as we were leaving the other day, and I was like,  you know what?  I did it the other night.  I do it once in a while.  After a show, I picked up this girl at Rascals down the shore, right?  So we went out.  I go, let's go get something to eat.  That's a lie.  You don't go, will you go home with me?  Because if they say no, you don't have a chance.  You say, let's go get something to eat.  You get them a turkey burger, I mean a hamburger.  And you got to eat anyway, so you figure what the hell might increase my odds. 
[02:54:00]  It's just true.  So we were fucking, we're in the diner, and I bought her whatever, a hamburger.  I didn't get her a whole deluxe, you know?  What the fuck?  And then we're sitting in the parking lot of the diner, and I start making out with her.  She said, I can't do this here.  I go, you know what?  You're right.  So I pulled out, and I went next door to the car wash, right?  And I started making out with her there.  She goes, I can't do this here, right?  And I'm fucking, she goes, I can't do it.  I go, I know where there's a little hotel.  It's a, you know, I didn't tell what kind, but on the other side of the highway, on 35 or 36 by Rascal South, there was like one of those, you check in for like, you know, an hour or whatever. 
[02:54:30]  Just for fucking.  We pull in the parking lot, and there's not one car in there, not one car in the lot.  I'm not bullshitting.  And, you know, it's all, you know, it's a beaten down side of the road motel.  And before I go in to get the room, we start making out, right?  And then she either blew me or jerked me off, and I shot a fucking load.  So I go, wait here.  I'll go get us the room. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, fuck.  Who's calling me?  It's that girl.  She's pissed.  Oh, it's Bonnie.  Hello?  Oh, Bonnie.  It's good.  Hold on.  I'm telling the story.  So.  Oh, shit.  I just hung up by mistake.  So I shot a load.  In the parking lot of the motel.  Yeah.  And I go, wait here.  I walked into the hotel, and I came back to the car.  I go, they're all sold out.  She goes, there's no cars here.  I go, it's a crack hotel.  But then when I went to drop her off at my car, I hand her my CD as she's getting out of the car.  Like it's a parting gift. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, here you go.  Because you blew your load, you had no desire to be in a motel room with her, so you went in.  Why the fuck?  I already shot my...  And they believe they were sold out.  I know.  I said, Joe, I don't know why they call her cum.  They should call her leave.  How did Florentine call her?  What did Bonnie want?  And we're saying, we got to do Jocktober.  Let's do this.  Why is she calling me at work?  This isn't work.  She knows you're here, right?  Yeah.  What's she doing?  That means she's up to something. 
[02:56:00]  How's it going?  Uh-oh.  What the fuck would somebody...  She wanted to make sure you're here, not on your way back.  She wanted to make sure you didn't leave early.  All she's got to do is keep the radio on.  It's a classic move, Rich.  Now I understand your paranoia.  You got satellite at home?  I got it on my phone.  I had the...  Can she get it?  No, it's not hooked up.  Oh, see.  Now she's not going to answer.  Now she's not going to answer.  Now she knows she's got time.  Yeah.  How much time?  If you left for right now, how long would it take you to get home?  See, Opie and Anthony know.  The reason you're calling, you... 
[02:56:30]  Put her on speaker, at least.  How can I put her on speaker?  How do you do...  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Speaker.  Oh.  Can you hear me?  Yes, I can hear you.  Put the phone next to the mic, please.  They're saying...  Now, I didn't say this.  They are.  That the reason...  This wasn't me, because I'm a different guy now.  They're saying the reason you're calling to see how I'm doing, because you know I'm at  radio, because you're trying to get a feel whether I could be coming home any minute  now. 
[02:57:00]  That's what they're saying.  Now, what's your response?  My response is that it would take you a long time to get home anyway.  Yeah, but you don't know...  You could be...  I know where you are.  I know where you are.  Why don't you just have sex when you're playing golf eight times a week?  I don't worry about you having sex with a girl.  If you have sex with other guys, I just don't want you to tell me.  She thinks I'm gay.  She thinks I'm gay.  Because you won't have sex with her enough.  We had sex last night.  Then it was two weeks before that. 
[02:57:30]  Hey, Barney, do you like kissing Rich Voss still?  Because Rich says he doesn't like kissing you.  No, I didn't say...  Hello?  We make out.  Hello?  Yeah?  Can you hear me?  I said we don't make out as much as we did in the beginning.  That's all.  I didn't say I didn't like it.  I love making out.  We just don't get around to it as much with the baby and everything.  And we watched some of the movie.  Everybody's cracking up.  Fucking Kenny couldn't stop laughing.  Oh, right on.  Okay.  Can I talk to Barney?  Barney, if you could hear me, Rich was mad because we weren't watching the film properly, 
[02:58:00]  by the way.  No, I'm not even kidding.  He got really mad at us because Ann just happened to maybe do a quick text or something in the  middle of it.  And he got really upset and said, well, we're not watching anymore because you're not watching  properly.  Aw, that's sweet.  So he's sticking up for you.  I thought we were watching properly.  We thought it was the rough cut we saw.  It looks really good. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  We got to go.  We got to do Rocktober.  Everybody's waiting for Rocktober.  It's called Jocktober.  It's Jocktober.  This is one of their biggest bits that they do every year.  Okay, cool.  I can't hear what's going on anyway.  All right.  Bye.  She should just call the show.  She doesn't know the number.  Where's Sam?  Is he around for this Jocktober?  Yeah, come on, Sam.  What the fuck would you say to my wife?  I don't like kissing her.  You want to start a fight?  You said it on the radio.  Yeah, but no one listens.  I can't even beat you up for that one. 
[02:59:00]  I don't have a comeback for that one, Rich.  You're right.  You're so right.  Jesus, two lawyers.  So basically saying it on the radio, it's like shouting in the middle of the forest.  Does anyone actually hear it?  Jesus.  Sam, what do we got for Jocktober?  Is it a quickie?  Because we only got 12 minutes left.  Oh, fuck.  Not really.  How's the vibe down the hall today?  Pretty good, I would assume?  No.  Well, the problem was some of the things that you said, I mean, they would have upset anybody 
[02:59:30]  in their situation.  Why?  What did I say wrong today?  I don't understand it.  You read their emails as if it's ridiculous that you're even sending me this, and then you  made a point to announce when the exact time was that you just ignored them completely and  stopped responding.  But my point was well taken, right?  Why I do that.  I took it well.  It made sense to me.  Right.  I want to fuck your eyebrows.  Wow.  Wow.  You miss Harry Bush's, huh? 
[03:00:00]  You want a Harry Bush?  Oh, I don't like that.  I think we want to just talk to Rich for the next time.  Oh, my God.  Fuck Jack Tober.  Jack Tober can wait.  Rich Ross, I don't know.  But can you tease who you were going to do?  I want to see if I know him.  And we were, well, we still have a, actually, we could do this, Sam, because I don't think  we have to play all these tracks.  Yeah, let's just get a couple.  Yeah.  All right.  Explain.  Well, we highlight, what show is it? 
[03:00:30]  I don't know.  They're all, you know.  Are they blurring together?  Same shit.  More or less.  I think on Thursday, a show that had a prank call service called Carmen's Calls, and so  as a special treat for all the Jocktober fans, I went and found every radio station that  uses Carmen's Calls.  The same bit?  Yes, they all.  And they all make believe that Carmen is special for just their radio show.  Yeah, it's like, this is their prank call, Lady Carmen. 
[03:01:00]  I did radio a couple weeks ago, and it was a guy and a lady, and the lady was sitting  like this in the chair with her legs up like a lady.  Yeah.  I'm going, how the fuck can you do good radio sitting like that?  Side saddle.  You know what I'm talking about like this?  Yeah, yeah.  Sitting like a fucking chick.  And it was fucking the worst.  Well, here's Carmen calling Rebecca and Leo on B93 in Odessa, Texas.  Oh, that's who we did, right?  This was the first show. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, boy, good morning.  Little Rebecca in the morning time, B93, and it's Monday morning, and, well, you got your  coffee, you're ready to roll, you got your coffee, your iPad, you're going through the  news, the mics are on, roll, and now you got your Carmen, you know what I'm saying? 
[03:02:00]  Why?  Andale, Carmen, andale.  And it's time for Carmen's Calls with Leo and Rebecca on B93.  Oh, what does the B stand for?  Oh.  Why is it so loud? 
[03:02:30]  It's time.  Why is it loud?  Oh.  Hello?  Hola, can I please speak to Mrs.  Yeah, this is she.  Hi, my name is Scottaman, and I'm calling with ***.  We're a little concerned at the fact that little *** has not been in school this entire semester  yet, and we have her enrolled, and we wanted to know if she's doing okay.  No, I didn't enroll her.  Because she's enrolled, we saved a spot for her, which means that another child wasn't able 
[03:03:00]  to take it, which means that we're out some money, which means that you are now responsible  for that money.  No, I'm sorry.  I mean, if someone else wants the spot, they can have it, but I...  That's great, but now I have to start making phone calls, and that costs me money, because  I have to actually take time, and time, of course, is...  Can you tell me how you got my phone number?  Excuse me.  Next time you have a question, raise your hands.  This is ridiculous.  Hello?  Wow, you got her to hang up. 
[03:03:30]  Wow.  You got the bad actress to hang up.  Yeah.  No, she worked at a school.  Wow.  Oh, really?  The bad actress hung up, Sam.  Yeah.  This is ridiculous.  Hello?  She called back.  Hello?  Hold on, this is Scotterman.  I believe we were disconnected.  No, we were not disconnected.  I hung up on you.  We've already started the school year, and this entire time, we've been marking her as  absent.  Which means...  Are you saying you're charging me?  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's ridiculous. 
[03:04:00]  I...  I...  No, but...  I don't understand.  That's ridiculous.  First of all, I've never heard of anything like this happening before, and what is wrong  with you people?  That's ridiculous.  What are you people?  Louie beans.  No, I don't mean you people.  Who's in...  Louie beans.  Yeah.  Who's enjoying this shit?  It's not...  I would understand if it was...  It's not interesting.  It's nothing.  I would understand if it's on one radio station, but we're about to show you what happens  with this shit.  Yeah.  I don't mean you people.  I mean your school.  What do you mean you people?  I don't understand.  You don't understand, and apparently your daughter's not going to understand much either, because 
[03:04:30]  you don't want to bring her to school.  Hello?  She can't contain herself.  Hello?  Yes.  What?  What do you mean?  Excuse me.  There's no need for you to be rude, okay?  Let me ask you a question.  I don't understand how...  Oh, excuse me.  I already told you.  I already told you to raise your damn hand.  I'll put your ass on time now.  Are you...  Are you...  Are you...  Do you teach at a school for...  Children?  Are you...  No, I don't.  Maybe that's why you're kidding here.  Yes.  Oh.  Ah!  No. 
[03:05:00]  What's this?  Oh, no, they didn't.  Hello, Leo and Rebecca.  They hung up on me.  I'm through.  Done!  Done!  Wow.  How did Carmen get a job with the district?  I'm just...  I'm just wondering, you know?  That must be part of the fee you pay is that she sends a thing with your names at the end.  You don't think she was sitting in there with them like, no, no, no, no. 
[03:05:30]  And that makes it sound like she's part of the show.  And, yeah, their special little...  Yeah, yeah.  ...show piece there.  Well, what you're about to see is she calls all over the fucking country, making believe  she's only calling for that one radio station, Anthony.  Here's Carmen calling Lucas and Amanda.  We won't play the whole bit.  Don't worry.  Please.  On KWIN in Stockton, California.  Stockton, California.  Coast to coast, Carmen.  The KWIN Morning Block Party with Amanda and Lucas. 
[03:06:00]  Hello?  Hello.  My name is Carmen, and I was calling to ask if you'd like to participate in a survey.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't really have any time right now to be...  It'll only take literally one minute.  Oh, my God.  Yes?  Yeah, sure.  Okay, do you like nuts?  Get it.  Why are you laughing?  You know, I'm...  Yeah, exactly.  Why are you laughing?  Yeah, you're laughing.  Exactly.  No one would laugh.  Even she knows.  I don't...  Um, you know, I'm sorry. 
[03:06:30]  I really...  I don't have time to...  Why are you laughing?  Hello?  Hello?  Hold on, I think she's got him, and I believe we were disconnected.  Um...  I'm calling...  Yeah.  No, listen.  I'm calling because I wanted to know if you wanted to participate in a survey.  You said okay, and then you started laughing, and then it just stopped.  Okay, uh...  I just wanted to know if you like nuts.  Isn't that the same actress from the other call?  From the other call?  No, they're different...  They work at different places.  Wait a second.  This isn't one person selling her bits to a bunch of radio shows, or is this every radio 
[03:07:00]  show pretending they're Carmen?  What the fuck is this?  I'm lost.  Oh, Rich.  You don't even know the basics of what we're doing right now.  I kind of do.  Rich, it is indeed.  Well, you didn't set it up kind of like my movie.  I set it up nice.  I didn't grab it.  It's the same fucking person making me believe she's working for one lousy radio station,  but she's working all over the country.  It's just a service.  It's a service, which basically what we're trying to show people is that these morning  shows don't do their own material. 
[03:07:30]  They just buy material out there.  That's what I'm saying.  So they're useless on the radio.  Why?  What is the...  Do I like nuts?  What?  And Anthony's now pointing out that the other person on the other end of the phone sounds  like the exact same person, too.  Other actors.  I think there's only two people.  Because not only is it a fake prank call, people are buying fake prank calls instead  of coming up with their own material for their morning shows.  I like nuts.  I love nuts.  Do you like nuts in your mouth?  That's usually where I eat them.  Where else do you put them?  Why are you laughing? 
[03:08:00]  This is just...  Is this a joke?  Is this for real?  Why every time when I say nuts, you start laughing?  Okay, you asked me to take a survey.  I'm sorry.  I just...  I don't...  I asked you, do you like nuts?  You said, yes, you like nuts.  Then I said, do you like them in your mouth?  And you said, yes, that's how you eat them.  And then I asked you, what else do you keep them?  You know what?  I'm sorry.  How much longer is this survey going to take?  Have you ever had nuts?  I'm not exactly sure what this is about. 
[03:08:30]  Have you ever had nuts in your car?  Send go.  In my car?  Yes.  Yeah, sometimes when I'm driving, I will pack a snack of nuts.  What about nuts in your pants?  Excuse me?  In your pocket.  Have you ever taken a pack of nuts in your pocket?  I'm sorry.  I don't...  How is this relevant?  Have you ever had nuts in your...  Okay.  What?  Your handbag.  No, no, I haven't.  So when you eat...  Here's the thing.  Even if this was the best phony phone call, it's still a phony phone call. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  But yeah, it doesn't even start there where it's not even a good fucking prank call.  You should talk to Carmen for your documentary.  Well, Anthony.  Yeah.  Carmen makes a brand new call for Obi and Lil Sean on Power 95.3 in Orlando.  We haven't heard it yet.  Brand new.  We're not going to play the...  We're not going to fucking play.  No, please.  Don't even play as much as...  All right.  We won't.  We won't.  Obi and Lil Sean on Power to show.  It's 829 right now.  It's 65 degrees this morning.  We're going to go into the 80s, but still breezy.  Now, on to another new adventure of the Carmen call. 
[03:09:30]  This is brand spanking new.  This time on...  You know what?  There's...  I don't even need to relay what's going on.  Let's check this out.  Carmen's getting a friend of hers.  Hello?  Hello.  My name is Skyriman, and I was calling to ask if you'd like to participate in a survey.  I'm sorry.  I don't really have any time right now to be...  It'll only take literally one minute.  Okay.  Yes?  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  Do you like nuts?  Oh, my God. 
[03:10:00]  That's the exact same answer.  The exact same one.  Both shows purchased the same call.  Oh, God.  And introduce this brand spanking new.  Yeah.  Let's go to Carmen with a brand spanking new call.  Let's go to Carmen calling Jay and Julian on B96 in Chicago.  All right.  B96, this is Jay and Julian.  Carmen, 7 a.m.  Crank call time.  Wow.  Carmen is calling a guy to let him know that his credit card might have been stolen.  You may want to hear what he's buying, though.  Apparently, he may want to lose a couple pounds. 
[03:10:30]  Future Biggest Loser contestant, maybe?  Hello?  Hi, is this available?  Hi, I'm Operator 1142, and I'm calling with card service.  It's Carmen.  It's Carmen.  It's Carmen.  And then Carmen calls someone in Wichita.  Wichita.  Power Morning Playhouse.  Listen to the intro for her, though.  Our Carmen call this morning.  Well, it's just downright mean, I got to tell you that.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm sorry.  Carmen being mean?  No, never. 
[03:11:00]  Well, we got this email from a guy.  He has a friend, I guess, who likes to go to strip clubs all the time.  Mm-hmm.  And...  Is this going to be the same call as the other call that we didn't play?  Mm-hmm.  But he's making it like he got an email.  Yeah.  And then Carmen calls.  Oh, boy.  Because they know Carmen.  Carmen's on their show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's their prank call.  So they got Carmen to call.  All right.  Well...  He wanted Carmen to call up his wife. 
[03:11:30]  Okay.  So we have a guy in Wichita this morning that's really hot.  He's in Wichita.  At Carmen.  Yeah.  And maybe a little tick to you and I, too.  I have no idea why you would be upset with us.  Here it is.  Carmen up to no good.  It's another Carmen call on Power 93.9.  Filler.  Filler.  Filler.  Filler.  Phone sounds filler. 
[03:12:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Yes?  Hello?  Who is this?  It's the same.  Hold on.  My name is got him in his **** there.  It's the same girl.  She's calling Wichita.  She's in Wichita.  This bitch is a gypsy.  I know your husband.  ****.  Okay.  Well, I don't really know him.  I'm a dancer at Big Al's.  Oh, shit.  And he's been coming here for the package.  Wichita, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah.  Big Al's is in Wichita.  I'm sure it is.  Somebody in Wichita is unhappy.  It continues.  Carmen calls the morning show on 95.5 The Beat in Atlanta.  Carmen, you're in a lot of pain. 
[03:12:30]  You're itching a lot.  Yeah, well.  I told you.  Don't go there.  You see them using the soundbites as if she's in the studio.  You can't be around all those people.  Or doing whatever you're doing with those people.  Go ahead and call up this person.  Oh, my God.  How do they sit there with any pride?  Hello.  Flowers.  It's a beautiful day for flowers.  This is ****.  How may I help you?  Hold on.  My name is Batman.  I'm calling to complain.  I received flowers from my boyfriend today.  Okay. 
[03:13:00]  Okay.  And he said that he got me...  It's the same shit.  They're just buying a bit.  Make him believe it's their own.  But she said they told her to.  Hey, give her a call.  You got a call.  You make that call.  Answering your phone is now officially deemed dangerous.  Danger is my middle name.  The Phone Jacks on the Cypher Sounds and Rosenberg Show.  Hold on, Carmen.  We're still taking calls right now on this Tiger Woods situation.  Basically, I asked the question, does being a cheater make you a bad father?  Yes. 
[03:13:30]  Okay, Fox, our decision may be overturned because women are upset right now.  Well, I'm a woman and I just wish that I had a father in my life.  All right.  You know, but I don't think that it makes you a bad father.  We're going to talk about that next after Carmen's Phone Jack because you know Carmen  is up to her same old tricks, man.  Carmen wants some information about hand-carved wooden ducks.  Now, do you respect wood?  I respect wood.  Pause.  But the guy she talks to, she starts calling him a loser for making those ducks.  Carmen, you can't do both. 
[03:14:00]  Carmen, Carmen, like she's right there.  Yeah, she is.  Hello?  Hola, my name is Carmen.  I wanted to get some information about the hand-carved wooden ducks.  Yeah, what would you like to know?  I want to know what they're for.  Actually, years ago, wooden ducks, decoy ducks were for duck hunting, but now they're collector's items.  What do you mean, decoy duck?  Like just in case, like you didn't get any ducks, you brought them home just to make you feel better?  Like, look, I got a duck.  No, no, no, no.  What? 
[03:14:30]  Originally, not, I mean, they still are made, but they're more high-tech now.  Originally, they were for to put on the lake and the other ducks would be attracted to them  and then you'd shoot those ducks.  And who makes the hand-carved wooden ducks?  Well, I prepare them.  What?  What a loser.  What?  What?  Hello?  Oh, the callback.  Do you want to hear the callback?  Do you want to hear Carmen callback?  This is New York City blazing hip-hop. 
[03:15:00]  If you make it to New York radio, you should be doing your fucking own bits.  As for radio, I don't know.  Or if you're playing this horse, you just say, look,  here's some horse shit that the PD fucking bought to enhance our show.  Here it is.  Nick Callen's talent guy.  Hold on, this is Scottiman.  I believe we were disconnected.  Yeah, we weren't disconnected.  I just hung up on you.  Why did you hang up on me?  Well, it sounds to me like you get a fake duck,  try to make it look like a real duck so that other ducks would be attracted to it 
[03:15:30]  like you're into some kind of duck porn.  Okay, you really have some attitude, lady.  I'm really sick of this, okay?  It sounds like to me you've got to find a real woman, for God's sakes.  Will you shut up?  Or are you making one of those out of wood?  Great acting.  What?  What?  What?  What did you say?  What?  What?  What did you say?  Why are you yelling at me?  What?  You, you were a, what did you say?  Listen, listen.  Never mind.  Forget it.  Okay, lady, I'm sorry.  No, listen.  At least you're not as much of a loser as those guys that make the high-tech fake ducks. 
[03:16:00]  What?  What?  Those guys are really geeks.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Can you f***ing hear me?  F*** you.  Hello?  Oh?  Oh.  That's right.  Hot 97.com for your phone jacks.  You can listen to them whenever you want.  And gotamenscalls.com if you want to see me naked.  Just kidding.  Oh.  You know you like it.  You hear how the audio quality drastically changes?  I know.  Because she said that separately than the f***ing Frank Hall. 
[03:16:30]  That's the f***ing bit, man.  You guys should be calling these stations daily.  What?  Daily.  What?  And asking them why they're doing this.  Why are you doing like a fake Carmen chick bit?  Yeah.  They'll go on the air with you to get national radio?  What are you kidding me?  Of course they will.  Oh.  And expose themselves.  I'm going to do that.  That's the frauds that they are.  That's the frauds that they are. </pre>
