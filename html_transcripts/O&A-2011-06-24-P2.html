<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The "After Opie and Anthony Live" show, hosted by Sam Roberts with E-Rock in studio, began with a discussion about the biases inherent in documentaries, using examples like "King of Kong," "The Cove," and "Catfish."  This segued into a lengthy segment detailing the unsuccessful attempts to book the band Sister Hazel, leading to a conversation about their current standing and booking practices.  Club Soda Kenny's prior apology to Sam was mentioned.  The winners of the "Couch of Zilches" contest were in studio, sharing their surprise and experiences.  Kayla from Octane radio promoted her new jewelry line and upcoming launch party, mentioning her other radio shows, including one focused on Christian rock.

A substantial portion of the broadcast centered around Ron Bennington's "Wheel of Hosts" idea, sparking a listener call-in segment suggesting potential hosts.  Numerous names were proposed, including SiriusXM personalities, past Opie & Anthony guests, and even Ron & Fez interns.  Sam expressed frustration with securing guests, citing the Sister Hazel debacle and his exclusion from Sturney Olo's show, mentioning a perceived "arch nemesis" within SiriusXM. The calls were varied in quality and enthusiasm.

The show concluded with a series of angry "F-U Line" calls directed at Bill Tetley and his theme song, followed by the "Line of the Day" segment featuring humorous listener submissions.  The broadcast ended with E-Rock delivering a repetitive and somewhat nonsensical rap/shout-out after the main show's conclusion was announced.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, sir.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  He already knew that.  I'm Sam Roberts. He already knew that, too.  I hope he skated out of here.  I guess he had an appointment he needed to keep or something.  But everybody's gone, except for us. It's a Friday. 
[00:00:30]  E-Rock, you're still here, right?  Yeah, I'm still here.  They won't give me back the monitor.  I want to look at you.  I wouldn't have to ask if you were here.  You're not missing anything.  You're right. You're right, Eric.  We've got to thank Seth Gordon for stopping by.  He directed King of Kong.  I mean, he's in to talk about horrible bosses.  I think everybody's going to go see that.  But King of Kong is probably the best documentary I've ever seen.  And regardless of whether or not it was biased one way or the other,  have you ever seen, Eric, have you ever seen a documentary that's not biased one way or the other? 
[00:01:00]  No, it's usually like, hey, I'm going to make this movie to express my particular point of view on this subject.  Like, whenever you watch a documentary and you look it up on Wikipedia or you Google it or something,  every single one has something from somebody else.  Like saying, well, he was lying about this, he was misleading about that.  My favorite ones are the ones, you know, the ones where they show like how vegetables can become fuel,  like corn can be turned into gasoline.  Yeah.  And then they're saying this is what we need to do.  This is how we're going to solve all our economic problems and whatnot.  And then you see the other one that's on the Netflix list about how horrible this is for the environment 
[00:01:30]  and how this is just going to destroy America.  When I watched The Cove, the one where they're killing all the dolphins and stuff,  at first I was like, I can't believe they're doing that to the dolphins.  And then I decided to look it up and, like, see what the controversies were around it.  And, I mean, there are people who bring up kind of a good point of...  It's just really shitty documentaries about how dolphins kill people.  Yeah, exactly.  No, I was, what's the difference between doing this to dolphins or cows?  And I was like, oh, yeah, I guess they just kill dolphins instead of other animals. 
[00:02:00]  It's that Dennis Leary bit, you know, you kill the ones that are stupid  and the cute and smart ones are the ones that get to live.  But I have to agree with Coco.  Did you see Catfish?  Yeah, I did.  I have to agree with CokeLogic on that.  Don't be afraid to disagree with your hero, Opie, Eric.  I see you hesitating in there.  I'll tell you where it lost me.  You know the part where they find the person's house and there's no one there,  so they look into the barn?  Yeah.  And I'm thinking, all right, this is going to get, like, kind of creepy. 
[00:02:30]  There's some, like, vicious going on.  And there's nothing.  Look, where it lost me is in 2011,  the idea that somebody is lying about who they really are on the Internet  is not shocking news.  This was, like, I figured this out in 1996 in chat rooms.  But for whatever reason, like, the fact that it wasn't really a little girl,  it was some woman pretending, I don't know.  And the discovery that she had all these phones and was doing these personalities  came, like, in the middle of the movie.  It wasn't the end for the big reveal. 
[00:03:00]  Plus, you assumed she was lying because it was on Facebook.  Like, you assume when you meet somebody on the Internet, they're lying.  So they do the reveal in the middle of the movie,  and then they're just kind of sitting there at this person's house,  and you're just waiting for the thing to end.  What's the status with Sister Hazel?  I don't know.  I can go find out.  Are they coming up here?  I heard they were.  Really?  If we could get Sister Hazel in here.  Let me make some calls.  Because all the people who won the, whatever, the Couches, Zilchers,  they're all still in here,  and I'm assuming that they would all like to see Sister Hazel. 
[00:03:30]  The Ron and Fez interns are now setting up for Ron and Fez.  They would like to see Sister Hazel.  It'd be nice if we could get them in here to follow up on some of that,  whatever, that lover boy buzz that we had going, what was that,  last week, two weeks ago?  Last week.  It's been a long week for some of us here.  Also, yesterday it was a wild after show.  Opie stuck around, Ron stuck around, Club Soda Kenny was here,  Mars was here,  and Club Soda Kenny ended up going on to my Facebook page 
[00:04:00]  and issuing an apology for calling me prick-faced Sam Roberts on the air.  And I guess people were commenting,  I hope that Club Soda Kenny knows that I accept his apology,  and if I have said anything that would really hurt him or his family,  I humbly apologize myself as well because that's not the intention of what we do here.  Sam, I got an update for you.  On Sister Hazel?  Yes.  Yeah?  They decided to pass. 
[00:04:30]  On what?  On doing your show.  What are they doing?  Other shows.  What other shows?  I have no idea.  Probably...  What, the phone show?  When were they big?  90?  So probably 90's on 9.  There's no way...  Is that all they're doing?  Why won't they just come in here for a second?  I don't even know what they're doing here.  Who told you that?  Uh, the talent booking people.  Well, tell them that Loverboy had a great time in here,  and Weird Hour had a great time in here,  and the Mob Wives had a great time in here.  All right, let me see what I can do.  You know, I mean, you gotta push this thing, Iraq. 
[00:05:00]  I know you do a good job, but you have to push this thing.  Um, so yeah, we have, uh, the Zilch is still in here.  Are you guys still all, like, pumped up?  Yeah.  You don't sound pumped up at all.  They just want to go home.  Yeah, I know.  So, did you guys, do you guys want to go home?  You don't have to stay.  Nah.  You sure?  The best hour.  You think so?  The best hour.  I didn't say that for the record.  That was, uh, Fabian.  I remember Fabian's name.  I don't remember anybody else's name. 
[00:05:30]  But, what's the female's name?  The female.  Amy.  Amy.  Uh, are you aware how few female listeners,  Opie and Anthony, and the whole virus as a whole have?  But, especially Opie and Anthony?  Uh, no, because, uh, a lot of guy friends I have listen to the show.  Uh, yeah.  I mean, we have a lot of listeners, but most of them are, like, male and overweight.  Actually, this, this grouping of guys here is not typical.  I mean, you're a slightly overweight guy who won the show, but not, like, really, like, obese. 
[00:06:00]  Like, there are a lot of savory characters who listen to this show, and, I mean, the fact that you all came in here,  and, I mean, some of you actually have jobs, you're a female, it's, like, it's not a typical ONA audience.  So, it really is an amazing thing that comes out of this, uh, of this Couch of Zeltches thing.  Did you guys have any idea what you were in store for?  You can come to one of these mics, I guess.  You guys have mics over there.  Did you guys have any idea what you were in store for?  Or, uh, when, when, the, the posting on Facebook was the first that any of you had heard about this. 
[00:06:30]  Did you have any idea what was going on?  No, just, I randomly gave it a shot.  I was like, why not?  A simple email.  Yeah.  And that's it.  Did you have to take off work?  Um, I work later in the afternoon, so it didn't affect my job at all.  You figured.  You might as well.  And did you have any, what's your name again?  Spencer.  Spencer.  You won the chair of honor.  I did.  Did you have any idea you were in store for such a life-changing morning?  No.  I woke up early on the way in, I hear the chair, uh, the, the couch of zilches. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And I was excited.  Because you were like, okay, they are really pumping this off.  This is great.  Then I got the chair of honor and the whole morning turned around.  That's amazing.  Uh, Sex Bagel.  Okay, E-Rock, fine.  You won't respond to Sex Bagel.  You have an update.  Yeah.  Okay, so here's the latest that I found out.  And it's not a slide at you that they didn't do the 10 a.m.?  I don't believe that for a second.  Well, here's the reason.  Uh, they're not doing serious at all because nobody booked them. 
[00:07:30]  Well, somebody's got to pass these things by me.  They were offered and no show wanted them.  Who's...  So they're not coming here.  Eric, who offers these things?  Troy, you know what I just found out?  Kayla, you can come on in and join the fun.  You know what I just found out?  What?  The, the, the word is that Sister Hazel was offered to the platform and everyone said no.  Wow.  What's everybody talking to that they don't want to talk to Sister Hazel?  Yeah.  And how can everybody say no when I didn't even get a shot?  Right.  You'll talk to anybody. 
[00:08:00]  Especially Sister Hazel.  I mean, you took Loverboy.  Yeah, I mean, I did.  Um, is Octane talking to Sister Hazel?  Yeah, no, I don't think so.  Okay, so you're one of the no's.  Yeah.  Um, because we would have loved to have, I mean, I think whoever is performing on Fox  News on Friday mornings should be coming to After ONA also on Friday mornings.  I mean, that makes perfect sense.  Right?  I think it's a good plan.  A nice little tie-in?  Yeah.  It's not happening, though.  Troy, you have a big weekend coming up.  Huge.  I guess I'm assuming that since you just waltzed in here, you want to plug DJ gigs. 
[00:08:30]  Well, I mean...  I mean, you just walked in like, hey, I'll join the conversation.  What are we talking about?  By the way...  That's not what I had in mind, but since you do bring it up, there's a couple things coming  up.  I'm actually in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania tonight at the Tally Ho, and...  You will be.  I will be tonight.  You spoke in the present tense.  It's the future tense.  I will be tonight in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania at the Tally Ho.  And then...  Good thing Sam's here for your grammar education.  Yeah, exactly.  He has horrible grammar, too.  No, I did well on my SATs.  I'll bet better than you.  I didn't even take them.  So, right there. 
[00:09:00]  You got a zero.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And then Monday here in New York City, I'm going to be at Tammie Hall.  Kayla from Octane.  That's her.  And the Boneyard.  Hey, it's me.  She's launching her new jewelry line.  Yeah.  So, I'm doing like a big launch party.  It's a slash birthday party as well.  And I have a jewelry line where you're going to be able to check out the jewelry there.  Troy's DJing.  We got Red performing the August Infinity, which is like a local New York band.  And then Uncrowned from Atlanta.  We're going to do a little runway show, show off the jewelry. 
[00:09:30]  I couldn't even get Obie to come to my birthday party.  And you've got all these bands and like...  It's a big event.  Troy Kwan is going to DJ.  Where is it?  It's at Tammany Hall.  So, it's on the Lower East Side.  Oh, my gosh.  All the information is on my website, thekayloreilly.com.  You can check out the jewelry there.  In fact, yesterday, I had our first purchase.  So, I'm all excited.  So, it's like up and running now.  This sounds so hip.  Lower East Side selling jewelry.  Yeah.  You've got a lot of things going on.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I mean, I like my rock music and doing that thing. 
[00:10:00]  But I kind of want to do something else.  Is it rock and roll jewelry?  Or is it like...  Yeah.  It's like rock and roll edgy guy and girl stuff.  I'm wearing a couple of pieces now.  Like two finger rings.  I like my spiked ring.  We call it the tenderizer.  I wear this one a lot.  Oh, I get it.  And it's good if you're going to get into fights.  Yeah.  Troy.  Yeah.  You've gotten into fights before.  I have.  I haven't had the ring on, but...  You could use it, though.  I could have used it.  Yeah.  Troy and I were just talking earlier today about how I need to start accessorizing more.  So, this could be perfect for me.  Yeah, this is good because the guy stuff and the chains and, like, you know, pendant type stuff that we have. 
[00:10:30]  We have, like, an amp jack.  We have devil horns, headphones and stuff.  You know, right up your alley.  Radio guy.  Yeah.  You know?  And it's not overbearing.  So, it's just a nice little accessorize for you.  That's why I was just about to ask.  Is it overbearing?  No.  No, is the answer.  Just a couple of little staple pieces.  Maybe, like, a nice necklace.  Are you going to start rocking some jewelry, Troy?  You know what?  I don't know.  It bothers me.  Jewelry does?  Yeah.  Because I don't know why.  Because I have, like, a real nice watch and I don't wear it.  Sometimes I wear a necklace.  Well, maybe Kayla has done her jewelry in such a way that...  It doesn't bother me.  It doesn't bother you. 
[00:11:00]  It'll work for both of you.  Yeah.  Well, we'll accessorize.  We'll see how we can do it.  And the cool thing is, if you come Monday night, we're also doing raffle prizes, prizes up  to...  Oh, my gosh.  50-50?  Well, you can win up to three different prizes and the proceeds are going to go to the Wounded  Warrior Project.  Give something back to our men and women.  So, no 50-50, then?  No, no.  Oh, well.  Then I'm not going to enter that raffle.  But, all the info is at the...  Yeah, the...  Because there's a lot of Kayla Reillies floating around. 
[00:11:30]  We're looking for the Kayla Reilly.  Well, I wanted KaylaReilly.com, but it was taken, so I don't know what it is.  The, not the, right?  The, the, the...  It's spelled the same way.  Well, isn't the with two E's?  No.  What are you, Shakespeare?  The is the same thing as the.  I don't think so.  I think there's an umlaut over top of it or something.  Oh, my God.  Big word.  Big word.  There is no website with an umlaut in it.  No?  No.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know that.  Uh, Kayla, you're on Octane and the Boneyard?  Yeah.  Actually, I'm on the Boneyard right now, so I'm going to probably head back and do some 
[00:12:00]  music.  Are you pretending you're live?  Is that why you're laughing?  No, she's live.  Kind of.  Yeah.  Um, well, I mean, I guess if you have to get back...  I was going to say...  What?  Uh, are you going to be plugging your jewelry just on every break?  No.  Why not?  Just be like, hey, that was a good song.  Well, that would be great.  Speaking of good music, you should get some jewelry.  Uh, no, that would be great.  That would actually be kind of cool, but I think I'd probably get in trouble for that.  Yeah.  I, I, if something tells me that some people down the hall would be a little upset about  that.  Once it's on the air, though, it's on the air. 
[00:12:30]  Plus, you're on...  They might be upset that I'm even here.  Who knows?  You're on...  Yeah.  You didn't get permission to do this?  They probably don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would assume not.  You're on Octane and the Boneyard.  Any other channels?  And I do a Christian rock show Saturday night.  That's right.  It's called The Message Amped.  I thought that's on the Catholic channel, right?  Uh, no, it's on The Message, which is like adult, contemporary kind of Christian music.  So, then we have like the rock side of that, uh, Saturday nights.  You're on three channels and you have your own jewelry line.  Yeah.  And a birthday party with bands and Troy Quintas, the DJ. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  So, even if all you want to do is make fun of Troy, you can come out, right, Troy?  I mean, if...  If...  As long as there's people coming out.  Yeah.  And enter the 50-50 while you're there.  Sure.  50-50.  All right.  Well, thank you for stopping by, Kayla.  I guess you do have to go back because...  Yeah.  That probably would be a good thing.  But I appreciate you having me on real fast and talk about it.  If you're in the New York City area, all the info is on thekaylarreilly.com.  Awesome.  Thanks.  Thank you, Kayla.  Troy.  Yo. 
[00:13:30]  Are you in...  Did you hear the after show yesterday?  Yes.  Are you in for this Wheel of Hosts concept?  Yeah.  I mean, sure.  You are.  I think there's people that would be better at doing it than me.  Don't sell yourself short.  Well, you know.  Eric, Wheel of Hosts, where are you at?  I'm not going to be in it.  Why?  But I'm going to help out with it.  Why aren't you going to be in it?  Because I've got too much to do.  If you weren't listening yesterday, Ron Bennington put the challenge forward that other people  should be hosting this show besides me.  And I said, nobody wanted to. 
[00:14:00]  That's why...  That's true.  That's the whole reason I got it.  And he said, well, you should have a Wheel of Hosts.  And, you know, every day a different host, and it's randomized.  And I said, okay.  I don't...  You know, I'm not attached to that level.  I don't mind doing that.  So next week we're going to do it.  And every day next week...  And I check...  Rob Cross, our boss, he's on the wheel.  I'm writing his name down right now.  Honestly, I think he's going to do a kick-ass job.  Better work...  I think he would do good.  Better than you?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm not like a radio host.  But you're on the air right now. 
[00:14:30]  And you're on the air on the Boneyard or whatever.  I'm not on the Boneyard.  Whatever.  One of those rock and roll channels.  Liquid metal.  Liquid metal.  But yeah, but you know what it is.  It's like you have to drive the ship.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  People don't understand how hard that really is to drive the ship.  I drive this ship right into an iceberg.  I don't care.  I'm crazy.  It doesn't matter.  We just see where we go.  I go with the current.  So I mean, I take my hands off the wheel and let it spin.  Yeah, but you're able to kind of rope it in in a certain area if you need to or send  it into a certain area.  I mean, that's harder than you think.  We should get the pulse of the fan base. 
[00:15:00]  Luckily, the couch of Zilchers is still here.  They're still here.  What are...  Like, who do you guys want to see hosting this next week?  Who do you guys...  What names pop up that you've heard on the air that you want to see on the wheel of hosts?  Any of you can go for it.  I'd love to see Kenny.  You want to see Club Soda Kenny?  One day.  Because yesterday, Club Soda Kenny said he wouldn't do it because he doesn't work for  free.  Right.  Which, that's a stipulation.  You're not going to get a paycheck for this one-off.  Or any-off. 
[00:15:30]  Any of you?  What do you think?  Mr. Chair of Honor.  Who do you want to see hosting this show?  I want to see David and Bobo again.  Oh, wait.  I turned off that.  What did you say?  David and Bobo again.  I'd love to see.  Okay, so David and Bobo.  But here's the problem.  We'd have to have them in studio every day next week.  Because the way this is going to work is,  we're going to spin the wheel right as the show begins.  So that people don't have time to like crap and do a whole bunch of stuff.  Right as the show begins, we'll spin the wheel.  And see who gets to host that day.  So now who do you think?  So there's what?  Like four options, essentially? 
[00:16:00]  No, no, no.  We'll have more than four.  I mean, this could be building wide.  We already got Troy.  We got Rob.  Eric, you're not going to do it?  No.  Should we add Travis and Danny?  They said they'll do it, right?  Danny would be good.  You want to see Danny?  Okay, we're going to add Danny.  Any votes for Travis?  Don't make it feel bad.  Yeah, why not?  You have got to be the quietest group of fans I've ever seen.  They made me nervous coming in because the guy was like,  don't talk, don't interrupt.  But I'm asking you a question. 
[00:16:30]  Now you're just being impolite.  He put us in like a weird zone.  That guy's gone.  He's in the car on his way home.  Yeah, all right.  Well, I'm going to...  And that's the guy I want to host.  Yeah, let him host.  People are calling me.  Hello?  You're on after OBS?  Yeah.  I wanted to put an offer in for who she hosts.  Who do you think?  Than.  Than.  I don't know if we can get Than.  He's very busy at Rockstar Games these days.  But he's fantastic.  He is good.  Thanks, buddy.  He's the soul of my life. 
[00:17:00]  How about you?  Hello.  You're on the show.  It's like the phone show.  Except no screener.  No.  Who do you think should be on the show?  Or host.  Sam, I think you...  I think Sam should keep doing it.  So you think I should put my own name on the wheel?  Yes, I do.  I like that.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Sam.  See, I got a little bit of support out there.  How about you, buddy?  You're on the air now.  Yeah, I want to see Reginald the Gay Flores.  I don't know if he was gay, but... 
[00:17:30]  Or the gay D-Man.  I don't know if D-Man was...  Or Fed is trying to fucking do some show.  All right, look, enough.  This is no room for nastiness.  How about you?  Hey, how about getting Stalker Patty in there?  Patty is a name that's been brought up now.  We may have to just get a group of misfits to just come and sit in all week, just in case  their name pops up on the wheel.  Yeah.  How about you?  You're on the air now.  Hey, what about Fezzy?  It just came up in the last call. 
[00:18:00]  I guess I shouldn't be yelling at him.  His phone was probably ringing.  Yeah, it's on delay.  Yeah.  How about you, buddy?  Yeah, hey, Sam.  Hey.  Too long.  I feel like I...  All right, now the phones are blowing up.  I told you people.  People say, nobody calls this show.  It's because I don't take calls.  The minute I take calls, what happens, Chair of Honor?  Look at this.  Look at the phone.  What happened?  Yeah, it lit up.  Boom.  You're on the air, whoever you are.  Who do you think should be on the wheel? 
[00:18:30]  Is this me, Sam?  Yeah, that's why the phone's not ringing anymore.  Oh, I didn't hear the click.  I'm terribly sorry.  That's all right, buddy.  The wheel of a post is a horrid idea.  This show is prime time Hollywood.  It's Sammy Sweetheart Roberts' show, and you have made it into what it is.  Who the hell says Ron Bennington gets to direct what goes on after opening Anthony's show?  He might be smart, he might be brilliant, but he has his own damn show.  This is your show.  He got stiffed on the busted open, which is bullshit.  This is your show. 
[00:19:00]  Thank you very much.  I like that caller.  Wow.  Thank you, sir.  I mean, but Ron Bennington is a guy who's been in the business for a long time, and any idea that he has, I'll respect.  Plus, I hope he thought it was a good idea.  So I said, let's go for it then.  You guys are not dumb guys when it comes to this stuff.  Uh, you're on the air now.  Yeah, yeah.  Lewis Twitchell's been Kenny.  You think it should be Twitchell's in the scene?  Is he still alive?  Uh, hopefully not.  All right.  Uh, how about you?  Uh, he hung up.  See?  I'm trying to go to the people whose phones have been ringing for like a minute, and they  hang up right before I get to them. 
[00:19:30]  It's like one of those, they had it, now it's gone.  Uh, how about you?  You're on the air.  Yeah, why don't you get a hoo-hoo?  He's off.  You think Howard Stern should come in and post after opening Anthony live?  I don't know if we can, I don't know if we can book that, but thanks, buddy.  You, whose name should I add to this list?  I think you should put a hoo-hoo on there, Sam.  All right, that, the guy right before you had that call.  I'm sorry.  He got so excited. 
[00:20:00]  I guess that's why people screen calls.  Yeah.  So they could be like, I mean, these phones are going crazy.  I could do this all day, but, I mean, these aren't real.  Twitchell's and Patty, I don't think we could just have Twitchell's in here running  and Fez interns.  Ron and Fez, Ron yesterday said that you guys were an amazing crop of interns.  Do you think you, as a unit, should be added to this list of people who could potentially  be on the wheel to host this show?  Meet all three of us?  Yeah, I mean, Troy, do you think I could just give, I can give it to one of them. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, give it to all three.  Do you think they should be on the list?  Sure.  What do you think?  I think we'd be up for it.  What about you, guy?  Yeah, we'd definitely be able to do it.  All right, I like the confidence.  So, Ron and Fez interns.  Oh, that's a hotline.  Hello.  What about Blake Shelton?  That's Roland suggesting Blake Shelton.  Thank you, Roland.  Well, Roland, you can come in here if you have a comment. 
[00:21:00]  You don't have to call the hotline.  I didn't look at the number.  I'm trying to memorize it.  Well, the voice is done next week.  So, you think Blake Shelton is going to come in here next week?  Well, E-Rock, you weren't able to get Sister Hazel for me.  Get on this Blake Shelton thing, okay?  All right.  I also have the, I was sent the list of all the acts that are going to do the Fox and  Friends concert series for the summer.  Okay, read them off.  I'll tell you who I would take.  Well, next week we're off Friday, so we can't do.  Her name was Anna Nalek.  I'll come in here and do Anna Nalek. 
[00:21:30]  All right, you'll be the only one then.  Okay.  Uh, then you have Augustana.  I don't know that group.  They should be.  They sound good.  Uh, Lifehouse.  Oh, yeah.  We got to get Lifehouse in here.  Hang him by a moment.  Michael Franti.  Michael Franti.  That sounds familiar to me.  Troy, you know Michael Franti.  I don't know who he is.  No.  Any of you Quiet fans know who he is?  No.  Let's see.  On the 29th of July, they have Three Doors Down.  Let's get Three Doors Down.  I bet somebody at Sirius has booked Three Doors Down.  I guarantee it.  I would think so.  Are they still relevant? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  I mean, they're on the pulse, right?  I would think so.  Then there's Matt Nathanson.  Oh, yeah.  Zito's probably busting a nut over Matt Nathanson.  He's good.  All he does is tweet about Matt Nathanson and John Mayer.  Uh, Grayson Chance.  Don't know who that is.  Switchfoot.  Switchfoot.  They're a real band.  Well, I'll talk to them.  Uh, Chris Young and Joshua Radden.  I don't like any of those bands as much as I like Sister Hazel and Loverboy.  Yeah.  They don't have the ironic comedy to them that Sister Hazel and Loverboy did, which is what 
[00:22:30]  has gotten in.  It just angered me about Sister Hazel not being here.  You know what I'll do?  I'll go and I'll look through the list for the Today Show and Good Morning America and  see if we can, uh, feel somebody from there.  Yeah, why don't we have Rihanna in here when Rihanna was performing on the Today Show?  Yeah, what the fuck?  You know what you should do, Eric?  Go downstairs.  I'm sure Sister Hazel is just wandering around on the sidewalk hoping somebody wants to talk  to him.  Probably having some of that free barbecue that they have out there.  Yeah, just go down and see if they want to talk.  Let's see if anybody's got any other suggestions.  How about you? 
[00:23:00]  You're on the phone show.  Yeah, how about Pepper Hicks?  Pepper?  That's a name that's...  Oh, damn Robert!  It's like chicken fingers and dicks in his mouth.  You were right about the first one.  Pepper Hicks.  Wow.  He's wound up.  Yeah, I mean, people get home crazy.  They get on the air and they go crazy.  Yeah, they're nuts.  How about you?  Now you're on the air.  Well, I was talking about Michael Franti.  I met him about three weeks ago. 
[00:23:30]  I'm going to hang up on you.  Roland just came in here and said Sister Hazel in ten minutes.  Roland!  You're not going to get me.  You're not going to.  He lies like that.  To all of you fans who have heard about Roland with his pranks, that was why.  He was lying just now.  There's no sister.  Is that right, Roland?  Did I call you out on a lie?  Not a lie.  They didn't want to do your show.  They'd rather take a shit.  E-Rock just told me that nobody in the company booked them.  Well, E-Rock just reading the list. 
[00:24:00]  I could read the list, too.  You don't think E-Rock's talented?  There's Brad Pitt.  Get him.  Tom Cruise.  Get him.  Roland.  You want the Today Show's list for their summer concert series?  I mean, it's probably a little more impressive.  Who's on Today?  Today they had Bruno Mars.  Why didn't we get Bruno Mars in here?  I know.  What the hell?  The line was all the way around Rockefeller Center when I was walking in.  So bring him up here and get some.  How long the line was?  How long was it?  Yeah.  I just said.  I hear you.  It was all the way around the block.  Shut up.  You got him.  You're funny.  Next week is Jill Scott. 
[00:24:30]  The week after.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, it's two days they're doing it.  Jill Scott and Pitbull featuring T-Pain and was it Nio?  Nio?  Nio?  Nio?  Jesus Christ, Eric.  If you're going to read lists, at least pronounce the names correctly.  Sorry, I don't know the rappers.  Oh, is that a racist comment?  July 8th, Blake Shelton.  So there you go, Roland.  July 8th, Blake Shelton.  Roland.  I already talked to his people.  He may come in.  Nice.  Roland, your name hasn't come up yet from these callers about the Wheel of Hosts for next  week?  That's fantastic. 
[00:25:00]  I think I might, though, suggest your name for the Wheel of Hosts.  Duh.  Could you handle this?  I don't know.  One day.  Rob Cross, I think.  Rob Cross is on the list, regardless.  He's there.  Mr. Niolla.  I don't know if he gets...  I mean, he's got his funny in the morning thing going.  I feel like...  Small picture guy?  Plus, I feel like Sturney Olo, his flame was hot this week because of the phone show.  Phone show's not on next week.  I feel like next week is burnout time.  This was his peak of popularity, and then next week he's going to be like, anybody could  book him.  He's like the American Idol rejects. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  So I don't know if I want to get him on this show.  There's some bitterness.  There's some bitterness.  I can just tell.  What?  Towards Sturney Olo.  With you.  You know why?  I do know why.  Yeah, because he fucked Sam over.  He did.  And he's telling me, hey, good morning.  Hey, I had no choice, but I had no decision making.  Well, I feel like as much as the...  Like yesterday, Ron and Fez spent so much time talking about the phone show, right?  Opie and Anthony talked about the phone show.  We, on the after show, introduced Steve Sturney Olo to the virus community and created an 
[00:26:00]  ONA star out of him.  Who did that?  Who brought him in?  You did.  You did.  Did I?  I don't know.  Did he?  Yeah, I'll take credit for it.  Why not?  And then I find out that on the finale of the phone show, he gets Pete Dominick and Nicole  from the morning mashup to be his guest judges.  After everything that we've done for him on the virus, he couldn't bring me...  If you're looking for a young up-and-comer, bring me in.  If you're looking for someone established, bring someone like Ron Bennington in.  You couldn't bring somebody from the virus in to be a guest judge on that show? 
[00:26:30]  That's fucked up.  We did.  Who else was talking?  You think the morning mashup was doing breaks about the phone show?  No.  I don't think so.  They probably mentioned it maybe one time in quick passage.  No, they didn't mention it.  Probably not.  Yeah.  Probably not at all.  Let me talk to this guy.  You're on the air.  You.  Yes.  Yes.  I would like to see Sam's mom.  My mom.  Ooh, if she brings carrot cake.  She may bring carrot cake.  I wonder if we could do a thing where my parents hosted the show.  They'd have to...  I mean, the whole problem is the randomization of it and the lack of prep time. 
[00:27:00]  I feel like it has to be people who work in this building, no?  Yeah.  Or do one where you have like a week out and like a special guest.  Well, that's a special guest thing.  That's not the wheel of hosts.  That's a whole different deal.  So let me see who we...  Oh, he's right there.  Tuesday meeting.  A new idea.  Jesus, bro.  So we have Troy, Rob Cross, Danny, Stalker Paddy, Twitchers, I don't know.  Reginald, the florist, the D-man are both on the list, I guess.  Ron and Fez interns as a group. 
[00:27:30]  Pepper Hicks, Roland.  Liam.  I don't think we need to get Liam in here.  I mean, I don't think even...  Could he do it?  I think, yeah, Liam could do it.  I think Liam could do it for two minutes.  Yeah.  Plus, Liam's too busy to sit in here for an hour, isn't he?  Yeah, they're not going to give him an hour off.  Yeah.  Well, can you do like a walk-by?  Liam could do a walk-by today.  What difference does that make?  That has nothing to do with the wheel.  Sober?  I can't guarantee that he's sober, no.  But, so, who else then?  Nobody voted for Travis, right?  Travis, yeah, I think you could do it. 
[00:28:00]  You did?  Yeah.  But the fans, I just gave them a third opportunity.  I'm like, Travis, anyone?  And they're like, no.  Pull the room.  I just did.  What was that?  Silence.  That's not a good way to be responded to.  I like Travis, but, I mean, do you like Travis, line two?  Hi.  Hey.  My On Air.  Yeah.  Do you like Travis for this thing?  Yeah, Travis fucking rules.  Okay, so I...  You could do it with D-Boy.  Well, I don't know if we can start pairing people up, because that's kind of like... 
[00:28:30]  I mean, the idea is to just let them in here and just let them go.  Like, if we start co-hosting people, it becomes a different thing.  It becomes a little easier.  How about Bill Tetley?  I wonder if Bill Tetley is free.  I know he's got a lot of stuff lined up.  He's got a Christmas special.  He's working on a couple different TV things.  We should put DeRozan, Bob Kelly, they live down the street.  Speaking of Bill Tetley, I wanted to play this again.  Oh, we should do line of the day today, Eric.  Oh.  We didn't even think of that. 
[00:29:00]  Can we get that ready real quick?  Let me take a look.  Okay.  Let me see what's done first.  Okay.  I know we were pulling lines.  We'll do line of the day.  I wanted to play this again, because ONA didn't get a chance to.  The FU line, which we opened up, it's 866-FU-LINE-1, right?  Yeah, where people just call up and rant about whatever's bothering them.  It's like the phone show.  So, this is a montage of people, only in one week, who all called up to rant about Bill 
[00:29:30]  Tetley and the Bill Tetley theme song.  Troy, have you brought the Bill Tetley theme song home with you?  I have not, no.  Not yet?  No.  Is it in your head at all?  Oh, yeah.  Sing it.  Sing it.  Bill Tetley.  No, no, no.  B-I-L-L-T.  What is it?  I don't know if it's the exact same.  Eric, are you marking this?  Yeah, that's a Marskin spell.  That's Troy.  It goes B-I-  I didn't have it as stuck in my head as other people did.  Roland, do you know the song?  No.  If you want to earn that, who knows a Bill Tetley song?  All right, let's get a female voice singing the Bill Tetley song. 
[00:30:00]  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley.  That's it.  That doesn't stick in your head.  I don't know what will.  Here's the F-U line in honor of Bill Tetley.  This fuck you goes out to B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley.  F-U-G-A-Y-O-U, Jimmy Norton.  Fuck you.  I got a big fuck you to B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley. 
[00:30:30]  Thanks a lot, Jimmy, you fucker.  I'd like to send an F-U to Jim Norton for getting that stupid Bill Tetley jingle stuck in my head all after.  F-U-C-K-Y-O-U, Jim Norton.  I just wanted to give a big F-U to B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley.  F-U-B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley.  You've been in my head all weekend.  Oh, B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y.  Fuck you. 
[00:31:00]  I want to send a big F-U to B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley.  Please shut the fuck up.  I can't fucking stand Bill Tetley.  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley.  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this fuck you goes out to Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley, why'd you put that stupid fucking song in my head?  F-U-C-K-Y-O-U? 
[00:31:30]  Ah, fuck you, Bill Tetley.  I want to give a big fuck you to Jimmy Norton for getting the B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley, stuck in my damn head for the last week.  Fuck you.  I just want to give an F-U to Jim Norton.  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tetley.  F-U-C-K-Y-O-U-J-I-M?  Fuck you, Jim Norton.  God damn, it's your stupid Bill Tetley fucking song.  I'm out here in the desert trying to lay a fucking pipeline. 
[00:32:00]  Stupid fucking song in my head.  Fuck you.  So Bill Tetley has some fans, needless to say.  Eric, were you able to pull it together?  Yeah, I just got it set up right now.  Oh, you are a dreamboat.  You could have two or three runners-up, depending on what you want to do for time here.  Let's do three runners-up.  All right, three runners-up and a winner.  Roland, you ready for this?  Yeah, is it playing up or no?  Huh?  Oh.  What's wrong with you?  What did he say? 
[00:32:30]  I don't know.  What did you just say?  I had a brain form.  My brain just went, meh.  Did he just wake up?  Yeah.  He just looked up at the ceiling as if there was like an airplane flying over you or something?  What were you, what was the response to that?  What did you think I was saying?  Ice-based dad for a moment.  Yeah, I don't know.  And then you put the headphones on.  All right, let's do a line of the day.  Eric, why don't you play us the first runner-up?  This is, by the way, C.O.P. and Anthony's show's line of the day.  If you missed any of these lines, listen to the replay. 
[00:33:00]  It starts at 3 p.m. Eastern, and it was a good one today.  So you're going to want to listen.  Here it is, the first runner-up.  Oh, sometimes I feel so alone on this radio show, but it's so good to know that there are people out there that think just like me.  Travis, did you get something from Nambla?  That was good.  That was good.  Nambla, Jim comes in for the runner-up.  You know what?  I think I know what number one is.  And if it is what I think it is, I hope it is what I think it is. 
[00:33:30]  Here is now the second runner-up for line of the day.  I think it was hiding while they open the lid.  And then he slides over to look at the goodness.  The goodness, yeah, yeah, the goodness of the shit just falling on his face.  Could you imagine how excited he gets when he's looking, no one's on to him, and he sees the asshole going,  Wee, wee, wah, wee, wah, wee, wah, wee, wah, and then it just opens up, and it's like, oh, here it comes, falling on my face. 
[00:34:00]  It's an asshole talking.  It's funny.  All right, runner-up, line of the day.  So if he drives you home, could he meet your dog?  What's his name?  I've got two dogs, Rosie and Mr. Maloonigan.  I just love hearing him say Mr. Maloonigan.  Bobo with a runner-up line of the day.  I thought that was going to win it, folks.  That was my pick for number one.  So, Eric, I mean, if that's not number one, when are we going back to original line of the day production, right? 
[00:34:30]  No, we're going to the current one.  We are?  Yes.  That's your call?  Yes.  Okay, okay.  Here comes something funny that was said on the show today, because we're here and live and on a vacation.  Sue and the company.  Mars swears that fucking uncles are touching kids in Hispanic families left and right. 
[00:35:00]  Hey, habla espanol.  Oh, no, dos, tres.  Those are the only ages.  Fuck you!  Let's give a round of applause for Tio Pablo.  Roland, are you sure you didn't get touched as a kid?  I think so.  No, I didn't get touched.  And Fabian, you too.  And I ask you, because you're Hispanic and you brought up, you confirmed Mars' thing of that being going on in the culture. 
[00:35:30]  But so far, every Hispanic person that we've talked to has told us, yeah, it didn't happen to me, but it happens a lot.  Well, I'm going to give you that same answer.  It didn't happen to me.  Some of you are lying.  Nah.  Are you lying?  It didn't happen to me, and I'm lying.  Do you know anybody you would happen to?  Yeah.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  Yeah, all the time.  All the time?  All the time, I swear.  You're thinking somebody would find another hobby.  I usually hear within ex-girlfriends that were Spanish, within time, they'll tell me, yeah. 
[00:36:00]  The females.  Oh, females.  I don't hear much of the barons or niños getting touched.  I mean, there are some that I would hear from the far distance, but with the niñas, I hear a lot more.  Roland?  Unfortunately.  Yeah.  What are Hispanics touching their kids?  Sure.  What do you mean, sure?  Where are you today, Roland?  Oh, no, I'm tired, man.  You thought, what?  You got on your director today and your two A-listers yesterday, and you're done, huh? 
[00:36:30]  I'm fucking done.  You're finished.  We had some Elijah Wood production today.  Yeah, next week to think about us.  Were you nervous when, uh, what's his name, the director for King of Kong, was late?  No.  Everybody, there's more people in here who can see you rolling your eyes down.  Well, I mean, you never know when Opie's going to be like, or Opie and Anthony, for that matter, are going to be like, all right, let's end the show early today.  Well, that's why I was worried, because I said, well, let's end it early, and he's supposed to be here at nine.  I think I told him, oh, he'll be here at nine, we can get him in early, then out early. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, didn't happen.  I mean, they had a great time with him.  They always do.  Oh, yeah.  But, uh, was he booked anywhere else on Sirius?  No, just here.  So he would have been, you would have, you would have tried to...  Dick in the ass.  Dick in the ass.  The infamous Roland, dick in the ass.  Well, look, next week is going to be a big week.  We're looking at a list of Troy, Rob Cross, Danny, Travis, the Ron and Fez interns, Pepper Hicks, Roland.  I don't know who's going to host this show next week. 
[00:37:30]  I'm going to spin that...  What did you say, Eric?  We're not putting, uh, Zito on that list?  Is he in there?  He was.  He just walked out as soon as I said that.  I don't know if Mark Zito's allowed to be on the air or not.  That's not my call.  That's Sam's arch nemesis.  He's going to put him on the air.  Why would that be my arch nemesis?  No.  Why?  I don't know.  Okay, well then, I don't know what that's based on.  Listen, Roland, go start your weekend.  Go start drinking.  I already have.  I figured you had.  I hope you all enjoyed your time as Zilch is on the couch. 
[00:38:00]  Um, I don't know if you can win twice in a row, but try again next week.  Maybe you can come back.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez.  You guys will have to listen on your radios because you're not sticking around in here.  You're done now.  This is it.  The glory is over.  And, uh, we'll be back next week on Monday with more, uh, Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony live.  Goodbye, everybody.  Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[00:38:30]  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey.  On the virus.  Oh, no.  Ladies and gentlemen, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Sex, Megan.  E-Rock.  I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.
