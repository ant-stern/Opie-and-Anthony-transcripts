<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, jumping between serious news events and irreverent humor.  The show opened with a discussion of the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, focusing on the Fukushima nuclear crisis. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton analyzed news reports, videos of the destruction, and the ongoing efforts to contain the meltdown, interspersed with darkly humorous commentary and speculation. They critiqued the Japanese government's response and media coverage, questioning the accuracy and potential for propaganda.  The segment also touched on the American fleet's involvement, volunteer efforts, the effectiveness of iodine pills, and the displacement of the Japanese population.  This was followed by a discussion of a New York bus crash, detailing morbid aspects and the survivors' subsequent casino visit.  Charlie Sheen's media presence was briefly compared to the scale of the Japanese disaster. A recurring comedic element was "Derek's Earthquake Remix," a remixed audio clip warning frantically about earthquakes.  Numerous phone numbers for various products and services were also mentioned.

Next, the hosts transitioned to a lighter topic: a video of a scantily clad South American weather girl. They attempted to identify her and share the video online.  Jim Norton recounted his trip to San Francisco, including crossing the Golden Gate Bridge (with Kenny, who joked about his imminent death), observing suicide prevention measures, and a visit to the Mythbusters' workshop where he met Carrie Byron.  Norton also detailed a visit to San Quentin State Prison, arranged by a fan who worked there. His account included vivid descriptions of the prison's layout, inmates, security measures, including witnessing a prisoner selling sneakers, and the "bad vibe" of an old torture chamber.  A stabbing interrupted their tour before they could see the gas chamber.  The discussion also covered prison-made weapons and contraband.  Finally, the segment concluded with the hosts' complaints about airline service, particularly frequent flyer programs, and a suggestive, altered sound bite from the *Today* show with Kathy Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb.  They briefly touched on the *Arthur* remake before a news update on Fukushima.

The following segment began with a discussion of the *Arthur* remake, focusing on Russell Brand's portrayal and comparisons to other remakes like *The Brady Bunch*. This transitioned into a discussion of Larry Kudlow's insensitive comments on CNBC regarding the Japanese tsunami's human and economic cost.  They then discussed Montreal radio host Marco Campagna's firing for excessive cursing due to a technical malfunction.  Michael Madsen's legal troubles, Gallagher's heart attack, and the hosts' dislike of Randy Quaid's performance in *Battle: Los Angeles* were also covered. A significant portion focused on the Black Israelites in Times Square, their behavior, and the perceived double standard in their treatment compared to others.  A black listener called in, questioning Opie's perceived fear of black people, leading to Opie recounting a personal incident. The conversation concluded with further discussion of the *Arthur* remake, the iPad 2 launch, and potential plans to interview Black Israelites.

A subsequent segment highlighted Anthony's self-made 80s sitcom-style video, detailing its violent and humorous plot, including a fake blood mishap.  They discussed posting it online.  The hosts mocked Bob Kellyâ€™s lack of an iPad 2 after their own purchases. A phone interview with UFC fighter Jon Jones followed, discussing his upcoming fight and training, interspersed with dropped calls.  The show then debated whether an SNL sketch was a rip-off or homage to their "Billy the Bassman" bit.  A childhood anecdote about meatloaf and a misinterpreted event was shared, alongside mentions of an upcoming Boston show at The Wilbur Theatre and a UFC event.

The final segment included a rambling discussion about a "meatloaf emporium" and Ted's tangents.  Jimmy's absence was explained by a "Wilbert the Pig Theater" engagement and a CD called "Despicable." The hosts briefly discussed the 10 o'clock hour's lineup, including Billy the Bass Man, Snoop Dogg's *The Wire* appearance, Carrie Byron, and Pamela's performance of "The Sign."  A humorous exchange about maintaining the illusion of a continuous broadcast while rushing to the elevator to speak with Sammy concluded the broadcast, followed by Jimmy mentioning upcoming filming for *The Tonight Show*.  Kenny was a guest in studio for a portion of the show.

[00:00:00]  I 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cream  style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God.  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts, buddy, and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and they've even gotten their  show suspended from satellite radio. 
[00:04:00]  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You're the crazy, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fuck and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Ah, fuck.  Hey, everybody.  This daylight savings time blows.  That hour, pretty important.  Yeah.  Pretty important.  I was laying in bed tweeting and someone wrote me and said, oh boy, you're tweeting at 1130.  Oh, yeah, I saw that.  Ant's tweeting at 1130.  There's not going to be a show tomorrow, is there?  Because I know it's going to be worse, Tom.  See, I read all your tweets.  I didn't write your back.  Sorry.  But I couldn't fucking sleep because it was supposed to be 1030. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you get that feeling like, fuck, I didn't think it was this late.  See, yeah.  As humans, we're just completely fucked up.  I think Japan shows that.  When you build nuclear power plants in an earthquake-ridden area, it just shows you that human beings are fucked up.  Sorry.  And right by the water.  Yeah, exactly.  So the tsunami can do stuff to you.  But then someone writes, you know, there's a nuclear power plant somewhere in New York.  Got a fault line, too.  A fault line in New York.  Shut up.  Every so often it goes, a shuka, shuka, shuka. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, a shuka, shuka, shuka.  Not a hydrogen fucking bomb blast or whatever the latest is in Japan.  But daylight savings time, really fast.  And then we can move on.  Why shock the system with springing forward or falling back with this hour crap?  Why shock us?  Why not give us a minute every day until it adds up to an hour, you idiots?  That's stuff like having to reset your watch every...  But why do I have to figure this stuff out?  What day is it?  It's March 14th. 
[00:06:00]  All right, so daylight savings time happened March 13th, right?  Yeah.  Start it, I don't know, February 13th.  And give us two minutes a day until it adds up to an hour.  And then no one notices.  Because this fucking blow is getting shocked by an hour.  When you wake up...  I woke up and some of my outside lights were still on because they're on timers.  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, why are they on?  Yeah.  Like, oh, yeah, that's right.  I got to fucking reset all the timers now.  Just ridiculous.  I like how a lot of clocks these days...  It used to be in the olden days, as I like to call it. 
[00:06:30]  You used to have to go around your house and fucking reset clocks all over the place.  Yeah, yeah.  Now they just kind of know.  Yeah, I know.  And they do it automatically.  It's kind of creepy that way.  It is.  My other observation, I know a lot of us...  There's a lot of us trying to get attention on YouTube and stuff with videos.  How do you compete with the videos that are coming in every day from Japan?  There have been some that are unbelievable.  How do you compete with this?  That one guy that was right down by the raging torrent, that was some unbelievable footage. 
[00:07:00]  It starts out seeing the street, and then you just see the water come by, and then by  the time he's done, entire buildings are gone.  And trucks and planes and everything else are floating by, crashing into everything.  And what the fuck are all those blue things in Japan?  I don't know what those are.  What are they?  I think they're carports or something, I'm thinking.  Really?  I don't know.  I don't know.  They don't look a little small, but they're in every shop.  Oh, look. 
[00:07:30]  Look in the back.  Is there some kind of recycling thing going on?  Maybe they're like recycling bins.  In Japan, where everyone has to have the same container?  Yeah, I don't know.  Because what is it?  Oh, those are actually things that they ship shit-porn in.  Who the fuck are you?  I'm Jim Norton.  Hi, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy's back.  Jimmy's back.  And last we left you, the death toll was 16, and we laughed at that, if you remember,  on Friday.  I don't even know why.  Is it higher?  I don't know why they give official numbers, because everyone knows it's way worse than that,  but they have to stick with the official numbers. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  But honestly, the numbers are pretty damn low, considering.  Well, one guy, a constable in a township, said that he personally knows that 10,000 people  are gone, just wiped away in his little town.  As you continue to watch the videos, though, I mean, if it's less than 100,000, I would  imagine Japan would be, I was going to use the word happy, that's not a good word, but  they're going to be sort of relieved that it wasn't worse, right?  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  I mean, a lot of these places, especially Japan, that have a good economy and have  earthquakes, they know how to build their shit and everything, you know, the building.  Did you see the videos of the buildings rocking back and forth?  Yeah, no.  Oh, man.  But maybe you can help me with this, because I heard that some of that video is old video,  that they're sneaking by us as new video.  Those bastards.  I read it a few places.  I don't know.  I don't know if that's true.  I don't either.  I'm sure those buildings were rocking.  Either way, who cares? 
[00:09:00]  You know, you've got skyscrapers really swaying.  Just swaying.  But they know how to, like, keep them from falling down.  True.  And they also build platforms for tsunamis.  Yeah.  Obviously, the one that...  Not in some towns.  Yeah, obviously, the one that hit.  I mean...  But you saw a lot of people in these homemade videos that are coming out, where you see  people just hanging out over rails and watching, like, the water just come flying by them.  Like, what are you doing there?  But they knew where to go in some places.  All the cars just get picked up at once and just start clunking together. 
[00:09:30]  And then just...  And then it looks like a water ride.  Yeah.  Then the car just goes...  Yeah.  Like a fucking log flume.  And I don't know how they're going to clean this stuff up.  I was seeing, like, just individual videos.  Not even videos.  Like, a part of one video.  And I was thinking to myself, that alone would take a week to clean up.  They had, like, cars piled up on each other.  A car on a roof.  And a house, like, slammed into the side.  And that's, like, one tiny, maybe...  Yeah.  Not even a block, like, one little lot. 
[00:10:00]  And I'm like, that would take forever to clean up.  Yeah, that.  And then you realize how strong that flow of water is.  When you see a ship, not a boat, a ship, capsize, hit an underpass...  Right.  ...and not even slow down.  Like, it just crushes it...  Right through it.  ...and shoves it out the other end like a wood chipper.  Unbelievable.  And what are they saying?  Now Japan has a lot more water or something?  Because a lot of this water didn't go back in the ocean.  No.  It's just going to be there now.  Japan, a lot of...  Because it's a low-lying area, so obviously the water is going to stay, you know, in some 
[00:10:30]  of these areas.  Japan's been, over the past few years, well, for a lot of years, they've taken land from  the ocean and made little extensions on Japan for...  Didn't they make an airport?  ...build up their real estate?  Yeah.  One of their airports.  One of their airports is all... that was in the middle of the water?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think.  And once the water comes in and reclaims that, it just doesn't go back in the way.  Yeah, that is it.  There's a guy they found 10 miles out on his house. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, I see that on the front page.  On his roof.  On his house.  That's crazy.  And only a Japanese guy could handle that.  Yeah.  An American would be screaming his ass off until, you know, he's dead or something.  This guy looks like he's hanging out just... you know, I'm just hanging at peace with  himself and the world and the universe.  Ah, if they get me, great.  If not, ah, whatever.  I'll enjoy the view until I die.  Him and his wife were evacuating at the time, and then his wife was waiting, I guess, outside.  Yeah.  And he went in to get some stuff out of the house, some personal items, and the tsunami 
[00:11:30]  hit, and his wife didn't quite make it.  Ooh.  So I'm sure he's kind of standing there on the roof, bumming out.  Maybe.  Maybe.  You know, they had a bad relationship.  Yeah, maybe he had a horrendous...  Maybe he didn't like her.  People don't want to hear this when you bring it up, but with all these tragedies, there  are probably a very small percent, I'll be honest with everyone, that are relieved.  Like, I was in a hell of a marriage that I didn't know how to get out of, and the next  thing you know, she fucking... she's out at sea. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And now I got to walk around this town making believe I'm bummed out.  I mean, there is some people that are truly relieved.  Believe me, there was at least one person I really wished was in Tower 1 or 2.  Yeah, exactly.  Believe me.  I imagine, eh, whatever.  But, you know...  It's probably a little too soon.  We should shut the fuck up.  Too soon?  Jesus.  No, I mean...  There's something there.  I mean, there's logic.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well...  No, the Tower 1.  Hey, it happens.  Certainly not, but...  It happens.  You're probably right.  There's somebody over there going, you know what?  Thank God.  I lost a lot of shit, but oh, that cunt is finally gone. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  There's somebody happy.  A bad neighbor, a horrendous boss, a kid touch, or something.  Yep.  But that's a small percentage.  This is just...  Not all good people.  This is horrendous, man.  So I can't even sleep at night, because every time I wake up and check the shit out, there's  some new thing happening.  What's the latest?  The nuke problem.  Although, boy, they sure are selling it over there.  There's been three explosions at this fuck you nuclear power plant. 
[00:13:00]  The first one I could handle, where it had the shockwave that you could visually see,  was kind of creepy.  But the latest one, where there's huge chunks flying in the sky...  And plumes of God knows what.  I'm thinking, man, I don't think that's good.  Yeah, and they're trying to spin it like, you know, well, that's...  You can't look at that footage and go, that's definitely the safety system they put in place  working like it's supposed to.  No, these are supposed to explode horrifically in a mushroom cloud.  No, we released a valve. 
[00:13:30]  That's all that is.  Yeah, yeah, that's...  It's perfect.  The buildings are supposed to absorb the explosion of the...  Really?  Really?  Is that what it does?  I don't necessarily trust the media in America.  I think they're probably a little worse than Japan with their propaganda.  Japan keeping, like, well, let's keep these people from really panicking now.  Yeah.  And also, it seems the American fleet, the Ronald Reagan, is out there.  And they sent a helicopter.  And it flew through one of these radioactive clouds.  Right.  And their sensors went off. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  And the ship's sensors went off.  Yeah.  So they turned the fleet around, and they're backing off a little bit.  They said, fuck that.  Yeah, but the Japanese officials are still saying, well, we don't have to worry about, you know, this.  Three explosions.  And they can't cool this core down like they're supposed to.  Well, I learned from Bill Nye, the science guy.  Bill Nye, the science guy.  Which I'm not comfortable watching him on TV explaining this shit, by the way.  I'm sure he has the knowledge, but he just.  Very odd looking.  He's very odd looking. 
[00:14:30]  And he did silly experiments and made a lot of dough off that on TV.  He looks like Uncle Leo's eyebrows, too, when they had to draw him in on Seinfeld.  Yeah, very good.  And he was explaining last night that, you know, you hear about cooling down these things.  Yeah.  And so someone goes, hey, Bill, who the fuck does this if there's radiation in the area?  Yeah, yeah.  Who's stupid enough to do it?  And I believe he says something like they get volunteers.  Volunteers.  So you got volunteers, and you're assuming they're doing the right thing. 
[00:15:00]  And he says it's pretty much like putting out a fire or something.  They just got these hoses, and the environment obviously is horrendous, and they're doing the best they can.  But there's explosions, too.  So they can't be doing this all the time.  And they're dressed in such a way that it knocks down the radiation, of course.  Yeah.  They're using the seawater.  But my point is, who the fuck would volunteer for that job?  Can you go with helicopters or planes?  Can you fly over and just drop it?  It's inside the building.  Like, it's inside the containment building.  So there's no way to get to it from air.  So you got to just literally pump the ocean water and douse this core that becomes uncovered because the cooling system is broken. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  And if the core becomes uncovered and isn't cooled, it just turns into a molten, radioactive mess that then burns through the containment floor, burns through the earth.  It melts rock and everything.  How far down does it go?  Until it hits water.  Until it hits underground water.  We got water down there.  There's water down there.  Nice.  And then a giant radioactive plume of steam and debris and everything else shoots into the atmosphere. 
[00:16:00]  It's a horrific thing.  It happened at Chernobyl.  Right.  Chernobyl had a meltdown.  But we're fine now, right?  A few years.  No, Chernobyl you still can't go to.  No, we're fine.  That is off limits.  They encased the whole place in concrete.  Wow.  And it's still like, you see, animals don't live more than a couple of years.  There's all kinds of mutated fucking babies from Teal that lived there.  And that was, you know, during the time where Russia really didn't fucking say anything. 
[00:16:30]  Everything's fine here, comrade.  Right.  Very good.  Right.  Really?  But, so that's like the thing that everybody's worrying about.  And with all these explosions, I don't know how you could keep a hose on a fucking core when things are exploding around you.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  It's unbelievable.  Is that a Chernobyl foot?  They did a special on a guy from Chernobyl who was going back to his apartment 20 years later or whatever.  He lived in Chernobyl, like right around there.  Get his keys?  It was supposed to be this emotional reunion. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  And it was awful.  He goes back and he's the guy who used to live here.  And then you're like, who gives a shit?  And that was the end of it.  And it looked like the day he left it.  Yeah, it did.  Just nobody was there.  Yeah.  A little dust.  Who cares?  It was just empty.  We're just stupid.  Oh, look at that big waterhead from Chernobyl.  We're just stupid as human beings.  We really are.  Why the nuclear power plants in Japan?  They get an earthquake every other day.  Tremors or something.  And they all know eventually they're going to get a really big one, but they still build nuclear power plants. 
[00:17:30]  They're supposed to be impervious to these things.  But when you get an earthquake of that magnitude and then a tsunami and then explosions, your safety systems, they start dropping off.  And we're still going to get the aftershock, they say.  Which is, if this was an 8.9, that means the aftershock, the real aftershock is going to be a 7.9.  They say, on average, it's like one less.  Really?  They'd be getting like sixes.  Yeah, but they said there's still one more big one if it follows the pattern of earthquakes. 
[00:18:00]  Earthquakes, yeah.  Yeah.  I like to know how somebody on the coast in California or Oregon, was it, died from the tsunami that hit there?  What a fucking idiot.  He was trying to take pictures.  Yeah.  And he got swept out.  How much advance notice do you fucking need to not go down to the beach?  That was like following your relatives flying that tsunami.  You know what I mean?  It's going to hit another six hours, another four hours. 
[00:18:30]  Okay, you got three hours.  Yeah.  How many weeks?  Clear the beaches.  If you're at the beach two hours from now, you got two hours to get the fuck out.  And yeah, you're right.  The guy still got swept out.  You see that marina that got nailed?  I laughed at those assholes.  But that was like, all their boats just going.  Yeah, but they did a story on those guys.  They're all sad and stuff.  It's like, sorry, but your sadness means nothing in this situation.  You lost your stupid houseboat and you don't know where you're going to live.  It was what?  Santa Cruz?  But in San Francisco, they kept showing the same footage of the same one boat. 
[00:19:00]  Two boats getting brushed back.  It's like, it's not going to kill a lot of people.  It was creepy, though.  It was pretty impressive.  That wave came into that marina, you know, what, eight, ten hours later.  From fucking Japan.  That's kind of fucking weird.  But still, I mean, your damage is nothing compared to what's going on in Japan.  They say that that energy wave in the water travels the speed of a jet.  Speed of a passenger jet.  500 miles, right?  It's just flying.  Didn't they say 500?  Yeah.  Just flying underwater.  No, it's weird.  I was telling you just before the show, I was at FH, my brother's joint, in Huntington for St. Paddy's Day. 
[00:19:30]  Nice turnout.  And I was driving home last night.  So I'm like, I've got to get the latest in Japan.  So I turn on the 1010 winds.  And for my whole ride, just about, well, about half the ride, about a half hour, 40 minutes, they didn't mention Japan once.  What's the problem?  We want to keep it local.  Yeah.  Enough of keeping it local.  We just saw this guy, John Huddy.  He's one of these, I don't know, fucking news guys on Five Local.  He's standing in flood water almost up to his knees. 
[00:20:00]  We need to tell you there's roving construction on the Gowanus.  Right.  Who gives a fuck?  We want to know locally, assholes, if this radiation in Japan is going to fuck us up here in New York.  We need to know if a radioactive cloud is headed our way.  Why don't you work on that instead of dumb floodwaters that are receding?  Yeah.  Just idiots.  And then 1010 winds not even mentioning it on the way home.  Like, what is that about?  They just want it to go away?  There is a hell of a jet stream, too, that goes right from Japan over to the United States. 
[00:20:30]  Well, we'll see how L.A. handles it first, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They'll get hit first.  The West Coast will get it.  Is that how it works, kind of?  And then the Midwest, a little north.  I think some parts of Canada get it.  We're tucked away nice here.  That happens, yeah.  Actually, the Japanese, during World War II, used to use that jet stream because it was so impossible to really get to the American mainland.  They'd put bombs on balloons and set them off into the atmosphere.  The jet stream would pick them up. 
[00:21:00]  And they would hope, once they got over the United States, that these balloons would deflate and these bombs would just come down and land willy-nilly.  What a great and dumb idea at the same time.  It's brilliantly stupid.  Right.  And a few of them, I think they do have record of a couple of them hitting in the forests of Oregon, which Oregon in the 40s must have been like, what are you going to hit?  A tree.  Right.  But a couple of them did make it over here, but none, you know.  You're talking too fast because when you said a forest in the 40s is like, I was going to say, is like your hair in the 80s. 
[00:21:30]  Exactly.  You're not hitting the fucking scalp anytime soon.  No, no.  Very lush.  Right.  Yes.  You could get lost in it.  Just hitting the top of the treetops.  Right.  Trees blink a little bit.  Now I had to go to the farm and get some new seedlings put in.  But look at this.  I mean, every day the new videos and pictures coming out of Japan.  Look at that.  That looks like a lumber yard. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Just miles and miles of wood that used to be houses.  You can't even tell they were houses.  It's a mess.  It's just.  And to see how that tsunami shit works, it doesn't look very threatening at first.  It looks like, oh, there's some water like trickling down the road.  Right.  And like, oh, this, you know, how high could it get?  Oh, it's up to the curb.  Yeah.  And then after a while, it's like there is the fucking Colorado River now.  Unbelievable.  Roaring down the main road here.  Unbelievable. 
[00:22:30]  Taking everything with it.  That water is some strong stuff when you get enough of it going in one direction.  You're very smart.  I was just listening to Antoine when he saw the nuclear reactors.  Yeah.  And I really feel like a little kid who just wants to ask you things.  Ant knows a little bit about everything.  But dude, I had no idea how they melted.  I'm like, what is a meltdown?  What is it?  And then you just happen to?  The core gets very hot when it's not covered with water.  How thick are the walls in a nuclear power plant?  Between the concrete and the steel and everything. 
[00:23:00]  You're looking probably, it depends on the age of the plant, but you're looking at upwards of 20 feet in some cases.  So why not make it 30 or 40 or 50?  You've got time on your hands.  It doesn't matter.  Oh, is that what it comes down to?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  It doesn't...  Because wouldn't you just make it a mile if you have a mile in the area?  Let's just make it a mile wide.  Why not?  Once the core hits groundwater, it doesn't matter how big anything is. 
[00:23:30]  The pressure alone...  This is not...  These...  Going off these explosions are hydrogen.  Like, hydrogen is expelled through the process and builds up.  And it's lighter than air, so it goes against the dome of the containment building.  And anything sets that off.  So those have been blowing up like the fucking Hindenburg.  Jesus.  And then they can't cool the core off, so...  How do you cool the core?  It usually sits in water.  And what they do is they have these nuclear rods, and they're separated by some type of material that keeps the rods from saying hello to each other. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  Because if these rods meet up with each other and get close to each other, they start getting hot.  Right, right.  They start trading shit.  So they separate them with this kind of, sometimes carbon, sometimes in the old school it was lead.  And then you slowly pull the rods out of this containment, and then the reaction starts happening.  It gets hot. 
[00:24:30]  And the water starts boiling.  And they take that boiling water and shove it through some turbines like a little steam kettle.  And it blows the turbines and spins it and spins the generator, and you get power.  So then if it gets too hot, they go up, up, and they dip it back in and keep it from separating and keep it from, you know, keep it from heating up.  And then the water's got to constantly be going through because the water would heat up instantly.  So you've got to keep circulating with these pumps.  Well, when the power died, the pumps died.  Then they had diesel backup. 
[00:25:00]  Those got swamped.  Then they went to battery backup, and battery power runs out.  So now they've got guys with hoses spraying the sea water.  Spraying salt water from the ocean on this thing.  And by the way, where's that water going?  Because I guarantee the nuclear power plant people are, you know, they're working for a company kind of like you and I and the rest of the people listening to it.  Oh, exactly.  You don't want to.  So they're like, you don't pay me enough to stay and stick around this joint.  Go fuck yourself.  Fuck you.  And that's why the volunteers that are just fucking nuts in the head. 
[00:25:30]  And do you think they won't let them talk about nuclear reactors that happened a year ago?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Get the hell out of here.  Yeah, so they're giving people iodine pills.  What does that do?  Does that keep your hair in?  Well, it's good for, like, one type of radiation poisoning, which I guess these reactors throw off.  And it fills up your thyroid with this iodine so that the radioactivity, which it goes to your thyroid and fills it up, can't fit into your thyroid. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, my God.  So it goes through your system instead of building up.  That's good.  It's kind of like, hey, no room here.  No room at the inn for you.  Yeah, that doesn't sound.  Yeah, that doesn't sound very healthy anyway.  You're going to get so much radiation, you want to be stuffed so it has nowhere to go but not your asshole.  Yes.  That's comforting.  Comforting.  Wow.  Yeah, it's a nasty situation.  Yeah, this isn't comforting at all. 
[00:26:30]  They said Japan moved, what, eight?  Is it eight feet or eight meters?  Eight feet.  Not meters, right?  Eight feet.  Eight feet.  The island of Japan moved to eight feet.  How does that happen?  And what does that do to GPS?  Like, would you be driving and it looked like you're eight feet off the road?  Oh, that's hilarious.  Because, like, GPS just knows earth coordinates.  It just fucks up everything.  They don't know where Japan is.  You think, um...  It's like, hey, wait a minute.  Did I make this turn in eight feet?  You motherfucker.  Do you think the news, it's...  They're really into it, obviously.  But do you think they have a sick perversion to this whole thing? 
[00:27:00]  Oh, every time!  Do you think they get really, really jacked and excited when something new is happening over there?  Everybody does.  Not just the news.  Because this is the truth of the matter with human beings, and I've got to be honest, I kind of feel this way, too.  I don't like the loss of life thing.  You know?  It's tragic.  But people...  That's why they go to action movies.  You love watching the footage of an entire house being torn off its foundation and being crushed going under a bridge. 
[00:27:30]  You just don't want to think that there's some old...  That's some fucking guy, right?  ...some old grandmas in there.  Right!  You hope...  Yeah, you want to see all this without the death part.  Yeah, they go, you know, we'll leave you now with some images from Japan.  Oh.  And they play the tragic music, and the images...  Thank you for saying that.  Yeah.  Sorry, go ahead.  I interrupted you.  No, because...  But they know that you're going to sit there and watch those fucking things.  But I'm glad you said tragic music.  Because I was yelling at my TV, I think it was CNN yesterday, it's bad enough, the images,  you don't need the...  Right, right. 
[00:28:00]  Sarah McLachlan fucking puppy with conjunctivitis.  Yeah, exactly.  You don't need to pump anything up.  Relax.  We get it.  No.  Sometimes maybe you need to pump it up, but you don't need to bring us down even later.  Lower.  We get it from the images you got.  It really is kind of a pat thing that they've been doing over the years.  It really is something that they just do every disaster.  We've seen this before.  Is Anderson Cooper okay? 
[00:28:30]  When I went to bed, there was a...  Someone punch him again, or...  Someone...  I think it's on Mediate.  M-E-D-I-A-I-T-E.  The latest explosion, Anderson Cooper was reporting, and he was basically saying, should I leave?  Oh, are you kidding me?  No.  That's funny.  He's like, should I leave?  He's like, I should probably just get the hell out of here.  Could someone tell me if I should leave?  He's like a little nervous. 
[00:29:00]  Does he have a radioactive badge on there?  Cooper reacts to...  I don't know if it's this one.  It says...  Yeah, he says...  They have his quote at the end of that...  Yeah, should I get out of here?  Let's give a listen.  I love this.  Sorry.  NHK is reporting.  White smoke seen at nuclear reactor.  Is it number one or number three?  It's a little long.  Whatever.  We have time to kill.  I'm being told that white smoke, smoke rising from a blast was heard, a reactor number three, 
[00:29:30]  smoke rising from a reactor number one.  We have Jim Walter, an employer expert, CNN contributor, standing by.  Jim, what does this tell you?  What does this tell you, Jim?  Well, as soon as you started to say that, Cooper, I said unit number three.  The government had been earlier concerned that hydrogen was building up.  Remember, at unit one, we had an explosion.  It turned out that that explosion did not compromise the core facility.  This might take a while, but...  But the same process...  Look at that Googler.  It's just amazing. 
[00:30:00]  Pretty fucking amazing.  We lose a cooling pump.  We have problems at one reactor.  The hydrogen builds up.  Then it explodes.  That happened at unit one.  Apparently now that's happened at unit three.  And we're going to have to...  There's no way to just keep hydrogen from not blowing up, it seems.  That hydrogen is wacky.  The hydrogen is on the sheet of the building itself and has left unaffected the reactor  and unaffected the containment vessel.  Because if it were to affect those things, that would be bad news.  So what went up? 
[00:30:30]  The cafeteria?  Oh, and by the way...  What the fuck?  What's exploding, dummy?  ...unit number three in order to cool it down.  So we're going to have to wait and see whether that's going to affect that process.  And that would certainly be unwelcome.  Unwelcome.  That's one way to put it.  Nuclear cloud.  Jim, just hold on.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  But first, I just want to ask my crew some questions.  How far are we from Fukushima?  North or...  Okay, which way is the wind brought?  West.  All right. 
[00:31:00]  I'm just concerned, Jim.  If there's an event like this, you now have an evacuation zone around Fukushima, 20 kilometers,  which is 12 miles.  We're now, we're about 100 kilometers to the north of this reactor.  Do you expect Japanese authorities to be expanding the evacuation zone?  It all depends on the particulars of this explosion.  If this explosion...  Should I get out of here?  Yeah.  I hear you, Anderson.  My...  And of course, I want to err on the side of the caution for you here. 
[00:31:30]  My guess is that you're okay.  But I don't want you to sue me if I'm wrong.  But I'm inclined...  No, the best part.  It's a long climb.  Why would it matter if he's sterile?  It doesn't matter if he goes sterile.  Not at all.  Less beverage for someone else, maybe.  It was so telling, because that guy gave his explanation.  There was a really long pause, because that's Anderson Cooper stepping out of his role as  a reporter going, that doesn't sound good.  I've got to get the fuck out of here.  He's getting smashed in the face over in Egypt, and now he's getting nuked in Japan. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, what are you doing?  You know, just stay in the fucking...  Use CGI.  That's what I say.  Just fucking stand in front of a green screen.  So if it doesn't hit any water, it'll just keep going?  Yeah, but it always hits water.  There's groundwater everywhere, you know, at some point.  But theoretically...  And that's why it's called the China Syndrome here in the United States, because theoretically  it would burn through the Earth to China.  But obviously it couldn't do that, because gravity is...  Is that a movie, The China Syndrome? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's a pretty good movie, actually.  I like that one.  It's...  Jack Lemmon's in it.  He's very good.  I like Jack Lemmon as a character.  Jack Lemmon was a great actor.  And that commie Jane Fonda was in it.  Yeah.  And it's very good.  It's about a nuclear power plant that had a problem, and they were trying to cover it  up.  Right.  Yeah.  Is it a true story?  No, but it was one of those things that's like, oh, that probably could happen.  Yeah.  But...  They liked making those...  Michael Douglas is in it.  It's a very young Michael Douglas.  It's an old movie. 
[00:33:00]  They liked making those...  It could be true movies in the 70s.  Yeah, yeah.  They loved those.  So, all right.  I don't know what the latest is.  It seems like we got another explosion over there, and there was a rumor of another tsunami,  but I guess that was false.  Yeah, they've been...  It's been hampering the rescue and recovery efforts.  They keep going out, and then the cops keep going, go back, go back.  There's been another aftershock, because with every aftershock, they don't know if it's  going to bring another tsunami.  Right.  So, yeah. 
[00:33:30]  On Twitter, one of the trending topics is pray for Japan.  That shit drives me nuts.  Pray for Japan.  Like, God was...  If you believe in God, he was fully aware that he was going to hit this area with an 8.9.  Yeah, what's...  Idiots.  Yeah, what...  It doesn't make sense.  So, now you want to pray for those people.  It's like, if God does everything, he did that, so what are you praying for?  Like, I don't understand.  And then with prayer, what, God's going to go, okay.  All right, you talked me into it.  You're right.  I'll put it back together.  I'm sorry.  God's reading his tweets. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  I'm sorry.  With the hashtag, pray for Japan.  Oh, I didn't see that coming.  And, I mean, and if that's the way you go in your life, look, I'm not...  Fine.  Fine.  I'm not going to argue that.  But, instead of praying for Japan, give money through the Red Cross.  Yeah, yeah.  Send a care package of fucking sponges.  I don't know.  Whatever the fuck.  Something, yeah.  Sponges and crazy glue.  They need a lot of that right now.  Ice cubes.  Send them ice cubes.  Send them ice cubes.  But then there was someone else that is starting something. 
[00:34:30]  I guess we were all supposed to wear red today for Japan.  What does that do?  Did I do that?  No, I don't have a stitch of red on me.  None of us have the red on for Japan today.  Maybe they couldn't get it going.  Maybe it was just one person.  But I saw it a few times being retweeted.  Wear red for Japan tomorrow.  Some guy who owns redpants.com.  Trying to get his business going.  But what does that do?  Nothing.  It brings us all together for what?  Let's support them.  If you're not giving them money, it doesn't matter in the end. 
[00:35:00]  It just makes you feel good and brings you closer to the tragedy.  They're not even asking for money.  I mean, Tokyo, for the most part, was spared completely.  They had some damage.  But again, they know how to build those buildings.  And then they just casually throw a few billion into the economy to stabilize it.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what they do.  They just get mad.  So why don't they use that few billion to make people's lives a little better?  I don't understand that shit.  You know what I am very fascinated with as far as the Japanese people go?  Their sense of unity, commitment to each other, and helping each other out. 
[00:35:30]  I don't see looting.  I don't see fucking people waiting around for other people to help them.  I see people that are motivated, taking care of each other and themselves in the wake of a huge, huge, epic disaster. 
[00:36:00]  You're really seeing that?  Yes, I am.  I'm not kidding you.  So what's that about, you think?  Well, that's about some people just are, I think, inherently better at taking care of things as a community than others, let's say.  There could also be a mentality that happens to your community once you get the old A-bomb hat.  That's everybody.  You know, it is amazing what a few years will do.  We're like, let's help Japan.  We dropped atomic bombs on them. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, compared to that, it's like, oh, this is, you know, it's a bad couple days.  I hear you.  Yeah, good point, Jim.  Well taken.  You want my theory on it?  Yeah.  Very simple.  I think when you all look the same, you kind of take care of each other.  Well, and sometimes.  I hate to say it, but.  But in some cases, that didn't work either, so.  But that's the first thing I thought of when you said that.  I think you're right.  It has something to do with the fact that everybody there is identical to a certain degree.  Japanese, and there's a weird.  There's a weird culture over there that is very, has a great work ethic, great sense of community, and, you know, working together as a unit. 
[00:37:00]  They think of themselves, Japanese think of themselves as Japanese, not, their sense of individuality and stuff isn't as important as sense of, you know, community and pride as Japan.  When you see them waiting on a line because someone told them to, like, okay, I'll wait on a line.  There's no fucking fighting and shit.  Did you see some of those videos?  There's no, there's no clamoring for fucking, like, grabbing at shit. 
[00:37:30]  They had a video of, the subway system was messed up yesterday, I guess, right?  And they just showed people online, and some people just asking the authorities, like, what's going on?  You could just, you could read their body language, and he's basically going, hey, you've got to wait on a line today.  And you see the person go, oh, okay.  All right.  All right, no problem.  All right.  All right, well.  You know, in New York, it'd be like, that's bullshit.  Yeah.  They'd be yelling and screaming and shoving.  I mean, yeah, you could think of disasters that have happened in this country and how they were handled and things, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever. 
[00:38:00]  I wonder if certain disasters would have been better, though, if the response to them had been a little bit better.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, Katrina was a lot of looting and stuff, but I wonder, that might have been better if the response had been a little bit more, a little faster.  Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.  God, we're watching footage of it going over a road, like, and then just wiping out an entire parking lot.  Just pushing cars.  These ships that fall off the edge of this embankment because the water is just, look at this ship. 
[00:38:30]  It's giant.  It falls in to the water, capsizes, hits an overpass, and doesn't even slow down.  Right.  And then it goes underneath.  It rips the shit out of it and squeezes under a bridge.  What do you do when you see that rush of water headed towards you?  Oh, man.  Look at these people.  They're driving away from it as quickly as they can.  Trying to outrun fucking a wave that God kicked at them.  Yeah.  That stinks.  And here's what it looks like at first.  You're just like, oh, there's some water coming down the street.  I can handle that. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  This is going to be a little fun.  And then before you know it, it's 20 feet high and ripping buildings from their foundations.  And those blue things again.  Those blue things.  What are they?  The little tsunami boats?  Why weren't more people in those?  Well, you know, one thing they don't hold is giant condoms.  They're probably, they've got small dicks.  I get it.  They're probably little radiation homes.  Is that it?  You just flip them on top of you?  Right.  They should.  Which are useless right now. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, and then the airplane that just is, you saw the one with the airplane just tooling  down the river?  The fucking disaster made river?  That is just a mess.  And like you said, where do you start?  All right, let's dig that fucking Toyota out of the mud.  And there's one.  Yeah, I don't know.  Only three million more cars to go.  When you talk about the people that helped with the cleanup down there in Katrina, they  said, yeah, we just left most of the stuff.  What are you going to do?  Where are you going to put it? 
[00:40:00]  You just leave it.  Holy shit.  You watched it.  It'll be a tourist attraction eventually.  So quickly.  Oh, yeah.  They don't fuck around, right?  They're crazy like worker ants.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  Hey, the other thing really fast.  There was a horrific bus crash here in New York.  Another fucking bus coming from a casino.  I don't know why you would get on a bus going or coming from a casino.  They were coming from a casino, right?  Yeah, they were going to Mohegan.  Oh, they were going to. 
[00:40:30]  Going to Mohegan.  And this driver says that a tractor trailer clipped him.  That's being disputed by a lot of survivors.  They said he was swerving a little bit or acting erratically.  A little erratic.  Like, so the bus tips over and you couldn't have fucking planned a disaster better.  It windshield first went right into a sign.  Right.  A pole.  Wow.  Those big giant signs that go over the highway.  Right.  Each side.  And ripped right through all the windows right to the back of the bus. 
[00:41:00]  Like the can opener.  Yeah.  It sliced through.  It must have decapitated a few people, I would think.  Well, the only reason I'm bringing it up, look at that pole.  It's not even dented.  It didn't move an inch.  Why do they have to be that strong, those poles, and right off the highway?  You know what it is with that?  Can they push that fucking thing way back in the woods?  Light poles have breakaways.  Right.  So if you hit a light pole, it'll fly over the top of your car, the modern ones.  Those are for those giant signs that are over six lanes of traffic. 
[00:41:30]  I understand.  The wind itself would rip down anything that...  So they need them that close to the highway?  Probably not that close, but as a little money saving, you don't need as much steel.  Where's that going to go?  Like, God, you always think if you're going to hit some of that shit, you know, God forbid  you're swerving or you fade off the road, that you could maybe go right through them.  And how about the people...  You're not going right through that thing.  How about the people that went a little further off the shoulder and went, thank God that  thing wasn't a little further off the road or I'd be dead. 
[00:42:00]  So I think no matter where you put it, someone's going to hit it.  You think there was someone in the backseat of the bus just staring at a pole?  A pole going like...  That's where it stopped?  Well, two survivors got on a bus and went up to Mohegan.  Afterwards?  After.  Fucking idiots.  Yep, a couple hours later, because the guy said, I figured Lady Luck was on my side.  Oh, really?  And he lost his money.  He lost money.  And it's like, maybe God was telling you, don't go.  Luck is not on your side.  You were in a bus accident.  You would have been one of those guys.  No, I think I'd have gone home and had a fucking drink. 
[00:42:30]  You got that gambling it so bad, I think you'd be one of those guys.  I don't know.  That's a gambler to me.  Someone said Lady Luck.  Depends how far on the road.  Lady Luck.  Yeah.  How close were we?  Someone said Lady Luck is on my side.  Yeah.  The guy in front of him had his head lopped off by a sign, and he thinks, I should go and  see if I can hit lemons.  What idiots.  Yeah, what goes on in your brain that you saw a bunch of people get decapitated, and your  first thought is, well, Blackjack.  It's like, well, can I get on a bus? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  And then you know he enjoyed his weekend.  Oh.  He was smoking.  Medical attention, please.  He was smoking, gambling, and probably enjoyed a fine restaurant up there.  That's fucked up.  Convincing himself, you know what?  You know, I'm on borrowed time.  You know what?  You can't take it with you.  You know, all the dumb things people tell themselves.  Wow.  What a horrible tragedy, though, man.  13, 14 people dead.  Yeah, that's a big bus accident.  He was betting on the coin toss.  He just chose heads. 
[00:43:30]  How mad is Charlie Sheen?  Because they were a bunch of decapitated people.  That was cute.  That was cute.  You never want to hear that your attempted humor was cute.  That could be the worst.  That was cute.  How mad is Charlie Sheen getting knocked off the front page like this?  Who's that?  Like that.  Who's that?  Floating.  Oh, God.  Charlie Sheen.  And he's still trying.  He's still trying to keep it going.  He just got his T-shirts out.  He got charliesheen.com.  He's got a picture of him with his new T-shirts. 
[00:44:00]  Good for him.  And, boy, losing.  I mean, is anyone saying winning anymore?  No.  No one's covering him.  He can't.  Sorry, Charlie.  I'm worried about this radiation and how close it's going to get to us.  Oh, really?  The artwork on his site was done by the same girl that did the poker chips for my house?  That's pretty cool.  There's another tie-in.  There's another rip-off from Charlie. 
[00:44:30]  Thank you.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  It does look like the poker chips.  Nice.  Good for Charlie.  And good for that artist.  Charlie Sheen's got a cool autograph.  I've got to give him that.  It's kind of like very loopy like Charlie.  But, yeah, he's done.  How do you compete against that?  You can't compete against the world ending.  No one's tweeting winning.  You can't compete against the world ending.  I'm sorry.  Fastball.  Sorry, Charlie.  Fastball.  T-shirts.  Buy them. 
[00:45:00]  Available.  Winning.  Winning.  Duh.  Duh.  Oof.  You think his live shows will be good?  Oh, my.  What is he going to do?  Yeah, that whole thing.  What's he going to do at a live show?  They're going to want something.  He's going to pack it with other people, I think.  Oh, of course.  It probably won't be a disaster.  He'll be able to get some real people behind him.  I would just show Platoon with live commentary.  Something like that.  How about you do that?  That'd be kind of cool.  Yeah.  Hey, Jesse Ventura. 
[00:45:30]  Should we start paying?  What is he doing?  I was just thinking, should we start paying attention to this guy?  It's the HAARP.  The HAARP system is what started the earthquake.  He's got to be talking somewhere.  Can we find his audio?  He's got to have a lot to say about this earthquake.  You don't think they painted the inside of the reactor with thermite paint?  It's obvious.  Is it?  Really?  What is he saying, though?  You got to think he's saying something.  You got to think.  Right when they closed down his conspiracy show.  Oh, boy.  That's not on anymore? 
[00:46:00]  No.  Do we have a chance at Michiukaku today?  I can't even look at Jimmy because we had a little fun with Michiukaku.  I've seen him on the news.  I heard about it.  He's all over the news.  My first thought is Jimmy's not going to be happy, but he got all his plugs in before  we really...  I'm sure it was deserved.  It was the day before we needed him, though.  The day before.  We called him about something stupid.  What we should do is find audio of him.  I think it was almost a year prior where he predicted this. 
[00:46:30]  Did he?  Everyone is tweeting the video going, because it's online somewhere, saying, Michiukaku predicted  this on your show, you dummies.  Oh, that there's going to be an earthquake in the ring of fire.  He said it's going to destroy a city, or...  I forgot exactly.  We should go through the audio, though.  And I think he mentioned Japan and San Francisco as the two big ones that it could possibly happen  to.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  He predicted this shit on our show, but we were too busy making fun of him.  Ah, the quatrains.  Can we try to get him on today? 
[00:47:00]  He's a big star, though.  I mean, everybody's using him.  He's probably busy, busy.  GMA's loving him.  ABC's loving him.  He's odd to look at.  He knows how to talk to regular people about physics.  Asian.  Nobody knows how to talk physics to regular people and make it countable.  I don't like how he giggles.  Like, he knows more than we do, and he giggles about it.  Ah, you dumb motherfuckers.  Here's what it is.  Yeah, he knows when the end of the world's going to happen, but he giggles as he tells you.  That's creepy.  The Haldron Collider could have a small black hole. 
[00:47:30]  Yes.  Picture it like a merry-go-round that you would ride on and laugh because you're retarded.  You know, I can't stand him.  Oh, yeah.  Dr. Steve is a little jealous.  A little jealous.  No one's calling Dr. Steve with his physics questions.  I bet he'd have good answers, though.  He probably would.  Dr. Steve would probably know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We should take our first break.  Yee-oh.  Hey, we've got to get this online. 
[00:48:00]  Too many people asking for Derek's Earthquake Remix.  We've got to put that somewhere because people want to download it and do whatever the fuck  with it, and I don't think it's online yet.  Earthquake.  Maybe we can put it on our Facebook, Danny.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Facebook.  It's got to get hosted somewhere for us, but yeah, we can do that.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, we'll figure it out, but people are asking for this.  If you haven't heard yet, Jimmy, there was this...  It's a viral video, this waterhead predicting earthquakes.  Oh, that guy's the best.  And then Derek took the audio and made this. 
[00:48:30]  Attention, citizens of California.  Attention, citizens of Oregon.  Attention, citizens of Washington.  Attention, citizens of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Earthquake, rustic.  Earthquake, rustic.

That video should have 40 to 50 million views  Easy  Screw fucking cats and all those cute animals on YouTube  That's what you want to see  They should fire Al Roker  And just hire a chick like that  Oh, would that be great?  Yes  Imagine the outrage  But you just bring her in

[00:56:30]  Oh, Jimmy was in San Francisco  Oh, were you?  Yes, I was  Great  Good comedy shows?  Unbelievable  Awesome  I needed a good weekend  It was phenomenal  Well, the economy's rough, man  It's harder to get people out these days  No, I know, but the shows were all packed and it was  That's good to hear  Yeah, it was great  It's one of my favorite cities  And I...  I saw your tweet and I'm thinking to myself  Man, I don't think Jimmy's feeling well  Because he's actually outside his hotel room for once  I know  Enjoying the sights of a city  You were out there in Frisco  Yeah, I call it Sanny Franny 
[00:57:00]  Because locals love that  Sanny Franny?  We were worried about you  The Barbary Coast  We were worried about you because the tsunami was going to hit over there somewhere  They were obsessed with that  It was nothing with that one marina with those three  With Quincy's house being blown  Yeah  That was the whole thing  My flat ass girl went off the boat  Yeah, there's an earthquake, Sam  And the tsunami's going to knock a cardboard ass right in the water  The man's going to float on it  Yeah, it was a...  They were just obsessed at... 
[00:57:30]  What were they saying could happen in San Francisco?  It was just...  They was going to take out the Golden Gate Bridge, right?  No, they didn't get that morbid  They were just saying that, you know, the reporters down there  I mean, one piece of footage they showed  There was somebody on the beach playing behind them  It was so bad  It was like, there's nothing going to happen here  Yeah, that's not...  You know, they took the local news  Can it happen here?  Yeah, it's the local angle  Very big there, I'm sure, yeah  Yeah  But someone was swept out to sea  I don't...  Right, some dope  When you see the ocean kind of like, you know  Pull back  Do the pull back 
[00:58:00]  Pull back  Why would you stick around?  Yeah, you don't stick around for that  That means something really bad is going to happen  Where'd it go?  Right  No  But you...  I saw that you tweeted a picture on the Golden Gate Bridge  I want to talk about that for a second  Because I was out there about a year ago  Yeah  That is...  One of the best things you could do  Is walk over that bridge  It is unbelievable  Well, we got there on Thursday  I got there on Thursday  I was very tired  I didn't do much  I do press Thursday  So Friday, I had gotten an email inviting me somewhere 
[00:58:30]  Two emails inviting me  And I never accept invitations  I never do  Yeah  But I decided to do it  I just...  I realized like  I want to live a little bit when I'm on the road  I don't...  I don't want to just sit in the hotel room and sleep all day  Yeah  Even though I was tired for the shows  I just...  All I do is sleep  It's depressing  Yeah, that's gotta be a drag  Yeah  It's good to get out, right?  Yeah  So we went to...  The second day we were...  On Saturday we went to the Golden Gate  I'm like, I want to walk across the Golden Gate  So we got like a car...  Rented like one of those...  Had to get a driver 
[00:59:00]  And just got plopped on one side of the bridge  And me and Kenny, just like two queens  Made a vacation out of it  And we got...  We were getting our picture  We were getting photos taken  Like, you know, before you go over the bridge  There's like that little scenic area  Where you can have San Francisco in the back  And there's a lady there  And Kenny goes, we're on our honeymoon  Could you take our picture?  So she does  And then we go to another lady for another photo  And Kenny goes, I said to her  I have six months to live, can you take our picture? 
[00:59:30]  I'm sure she's heard that before  Holy shit  He's a little homoerotic  Yes, I have six months  He picked the wrong city though  To get the shock value  Oh yeah, nobody was surprised  Nah  You do that in Texas though  They'll be like, what the fuck you boys doing down here?  It was a nice walk over  I'm afraid of heights  So it was kind of uncomfortable  Because of...  The bridge shakes  Yeah  You were frightened?  Yes  Not only does the bridge shake  These guys fly over the bridge 
[01:00:00]  60, 70 miles an hour  No problem  And they're feet away from your head  As you're walking out there  Damn  Right?  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah, it was amazing  You can feel the air of the car going on  Yeah  So you got a shaky bridge  The drop off is just unbelievable  And then you got the cars zooming by your head  Do you look at the spots  Where you know people probably jumped off?  Oh yeah  You can see the easy places  The creepy thing  Probably Jimmy saw this  When you look over the rail  There's like an area  There's like...  Right? 
[01:00:30]  There's like a...  I'm trying to remember  Like a beam or something  There's like a one foot extension  Did you see the shoes and stuff?  And you're like, alright  Who left their fucking shoe there and why?  Oh no, I didn't see any shoes  You didn't see any shoes?  No, no, no, no  It's classic  I'm sure there's some jokester  Who just fucking puts one in a backpack  And goes, I'm gonna fucking leave a shoe here  For whatever reason  Oh yeah, you'll see the shoes if you look long enough  Well they had this...  That's the photo of Kenny and I  That was the one who thought he had six months to live  Oh, that's lovely  And there's the first one  Is us with San Francisco in the background  Yes, look at that 
[01:01:00]  And that was a little bit of honeymooning  Oh, you two girls  I'm trying to find the one  That was the...  Oh, it's on my phone  There's the little call box  That says, if you feel depressed  Oh, really?  They put a call box up there  It's like, yeah  This is a great place to jump  Please give us a call  It says that, yeah  Like, it gets better  I think I took a photo  I saw the one near the call box  That was pretty funny  Oh, the one I tweeted?  Yeah, yeah  What's it say?  It has little yellow phone boxes everywhere  And it says, crisis counseling 
[01:01:30]  There is hope  Make the call  The consequences of jumping from this bridge are fatal  Fatal and tragic  And it's like a yellow  Oh  A little yellow button that you push  And I guess you talk to somebody  And you're just smiling, pointing at it  Just big ass  But it's not fatal  Because when you were out there  A high school kid jumped  On a dare, right?  On a dare, right?  Yeah, I read about that  And survived  And survived  Did he get hurt?  I don't know, but he survived  Just got busted up a little bit  How do you do that on a dare?  That's crazy  It's scary  I get scared looking up 
[01:02:00]  Like, we were stopped in the middle of the bridge  And I would look up at the suspension cables  And I get vertigo  I have to hold on to something when I look up  Can he?  No, because that big pussy was frightened too  Was he really?  Of course he was  Oh, that's great  He kept stopping  And he kept holding on to the rail as he looked over  He's like, I'm afraid someone's going to push me  Who's going to push a monster like him?  If I was taller, I'd love to  Right  You can't move, can he?  No  It was a really, really fucking cool thing to do to walk across  People who live out there, I know to you it's nothing 
[01:02:30]  But I had never done it  And it was just scary touching the beams and the bridge  It's really frightening  It's just so big too  It is  You can tell the locals on their bikes and walking  They don't even look at the view  Because they've done it a million times  They're just trying to go home  And that's what they use  That's like walking around Manhattan  Yeah, I guess  Because after a while you don't look up at the buildings  You don't look up and go, ooh  It just creeped me out looking up the  Looking up  Oh, that's a cool picture  Yeah, that's very cool  Looking up the  I took a picture at the base of the cables  The cables  I'm looking straight up 
[01:03:00]  And it's just, it really  That's a very artistic photo, Jimmy  Yeah, and I took this one of the bridges  A little bit off-center  I'm really  My new photography class  Yes  You're gonna get a C- on that  You gotta  Oh, that wasn't very good  But the colors were nice  You should be using the rule of thirds  Right  Very nice  What's the rule of thirds?  You just, you know, put it in  Split the whole thing up into thirds  No, no  All the way on the left is the bridge picture  And then on the right is just sky  Yeah  But I wanted it to be balanced  It's my photo  My collage called Balance  There's a collage called Balance 
[01:03:30]  Balance  And I have balanced photos  Are you getting an art show together?  Yes, I am  I'm attempting  Photography is my new  Look at this photo  It's my passion  It really is  It's my love  It's where I express myself  Like, look at this photo  There's a little few boats out there  Yeah, look at that  There's an island in the back  Isn't that Alcatraz?  It certainly is  It's more than an island, my friend  But you can't see it  It looks just like it  Look at these boats  Look at the zoom on those boats  I mean  Oh  I'm actually writing  I'm releasing  A photo book  Oh 
[01:04:00]  And it's called Boats Down There  And there's a lot of aerial views of boats  Of boats down there  As funny as that is  Some douche is probably doing that exact thing  Boats down there  And there I am holding on  Look guys, I'm holding on very frightened  Wow  I actually was nervous though  Yeah, I don't know  It's creepy  But really, really fucking cool, man  The iPad rules to look at pictures  I have to say that  It really does, doesn't it?  Yeah  And then you just  You could make them bigger or smaller  You pinch  Yeah 
[01:04:30]  You go, you expand  Yeah, you know how it is  Oh, look at that  You go to the thing  Look at you  Talk about it  That's kind of cool too  Oh, the Mythbusters warehouse thing there  I got it  Jimmy had a tourist weekend  I did the day before  I'd gotten a couple of emails  And let me see if I can just read one  Oh, that would be nice  If I can find it  I'd probably  Oh, here it is  I don't know what her  Carrie Byron  Yes, it's Carrie  She writes  From Mythbusters  She writes  Hello, Mr. Norton 
[01:05:00]  I heard on Twitter  That you're coming to town  I'm trying to find a babysitter  So I can come see you  I know you don't watch Mythbusters  But if you want to make your friend Danny jealous  You have an open invitation  To come to our shop in San Francisco  Oh, that's great  Oh, man  Hey, she remembered you, Danny  She did  That's at least a good thing, right?  No?  I guess  I guess  Yeah, she remembered you  I guess  I guess so  And I did go to the Mythbusters 
[01:05:30]  Their lab  Or factory  Yeah, the one that she was working at  M7  I don't know  Maybe that was it  I don't know  We did it on the way back from the other place  Where's Kenny?  He might be getting me some hot soup  Oh  Oh, here he is  Good  Oh, hi Kenny  So what did you see?  What were they doing?  Yeah, why isn't there any part of this?  They were only doing a little green screen  Wait, wait, I want to go backwards  Oh, they were?  So how was your Golden Gate Bridge experience there, Kenny?  Any time I get to spend with Jim is terrific  Atta boy 
[01:06:00]  Do you have any feelings for anything?  I have  I have  What was your take on the Golden Gate Bridge?  I have very dire feelings for you, Anthony and Jimmy  What was your experience like on the Golden Gate Bridge?  It was  Did you even know you were up there?  Yeah, I know  It was a beautiful day  It was like 60 degrees  A little breezy  Oh  You know?  It was a two mile walk across the bridge  We kept stuck  Two miles  Yeah  Yeah, two miles 
[01:06:30]  I had to piss for most of it too  That's the worst part  Is you really want to hang your hog off the bridge  And just let it fly onto the sailboat people  At the sailboat  And I figured that'd be a great shot for boats down there  The flicker of yellow rain on the little people in their boats  One fella said the water cold  The other fella said the deep  I believe one was a comedian from New York  And one was lurch  Get it?  Get it?  I did something very exciting on the bridge  Oh? 
[01:07:00]  Not what I was encouraging you to do  Yeah, exactly  Big first for Kenny  I would have liked to have seen him jump  What'd you do?  I spit my gum and watched it float down into the water  The water  That's exciting for you?  Yeah, for him it is  You don't spend enough time with him  That's a big thing  Were you studying the wind and what it did to the gum?  Did it make it go sideways?  The bridge, was the bridge doing something to the wind?  No, it didn't take it too far 
[01:07:30]  No?  Pretty straight  And you think he's kidding  But he actually did tell me  I spit my gum and I watched it  I watched it  Do you understand?  As awful as this is  This is the second time I'm hearing this story  I can get it  It's the second time I'm hearing it  And I watched it  I wish it was still in your mouth  I wish she was still chewing it  As you watched it go down 
[01:08:00]  But it is, to look straight down like that is really frightening  For me the heights are terrible  I don't want to lose this guy  He says he knows the kid that jumped off the bridge  Eric, you just trying to get on the show or is this real?  No, no, no, it's real  Actually what happened is my buddy surfs underneath the bridge there  The Golden Gate Bridge  And he was down there surfing  And no more than 5'10 feet away from all of a sudden he just hears splat  And this kid just lands in the water  So they run over on their surfboard to pick him up and all the kid says 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, I made it!  And they got him up on the paddleboard  And rushed him to shore  And the kid got a broken ankle and a ruptured spleen  Oh, he ruptured a spleen, wow  Oh, that's spleen  What's that?  No, sorry, go ahead, bud  I don't personally know the kid but he goes to a high school up here in Windsor, California  Which is about an hour north of...  Was he fucked up?  And were his friends right there encouraging him to do it? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, no, it was just a school trip  And he just got up to the bridge and jumped off  Where he jumped off is not exactly the highest point of the bridge  It's high enough  He fell 200 feet, survived with a torn lung  A broken tailbone, officials said  Yeah, I thought it was a broken ankle  My buddy surfs there all the time  His foot up his ass  And all of a sudden, you know, the kid just splats right in the water  10 feet away from him  200 feet, that's a 20-story building  So he, on a dare, he could either die 
[01:09:30]  Most likely, he should have died  Yeah, he's got balls, he did a dare  He's gonna be a big shit on campus  Boy, is he?  He'll have to keep topping himself  Probably gonna get into a better college now  That's what they're looking for  It'd be funny if he died falling off a chair in his kitchen  The irony would be so thick you could cut it with a knife  He actually, I actually know that kid  I had handed him a camera  Because I wanted the, I wanted the snap as he was falling 
[01:10:00]  I said I wanted to get some action shots  For boats down there  For boats down there  It's my coffee table book  Of boats taken from the air  Did you shush Carrie from Mythbusters during your comedy show?  No, did I?  You might have, maybe you didn't know  Armando  Hello  What's going on fellas?  Hi  You were at Jimmy's shows out there?  I was, Friday night, the late show  He killed guys  Thanks man, that was great  Of course he did  Despicable, on sale now 
[01:10:30]  Anyway, I was sitting next to Carrie  And one of the other guys, the white guy  From Mythbusters  Tori, yes  Yeah, those guys were laughing their asses off too  But at one point, Jimmy asked the audience about roleplaying  And who asked little, you know, little kinky stuff  Oh, is that what I said, yes miss, but I'm talking to her?  Yeah, she said shush madam, or something like that  Oh, was that Carrie? I didn't know that  Was she chiming in for roleplay?  She was, and I was like, oh my god  Oh, I didn't know that was, because she could 
[01:11:00]  I never see people I know close where I could see their faces  Yeah  I wish I would have known that was her  Because nobody wanted to, I always ask you for the same  But we talk about roleplay sometimes with the audience  And one woman said that she had used it  Or wanted to use a strap-on or something  Oof, yeah  Was it strap-on or roleplay that Carrie spoke?  I didn't know it was her  Oh, roleplay  And I was like, I had the biggest fucking rod  I'm thinking Carrie is about to tell everybody about her fucking roleplaying  And you ruined it, Jimmy  I didn't know it was her  Believe me, I would love to 
[01:11:30]  I've never heard about Carrie's roleplay than that lady  Yeah, me too, she was a fucking whore  She didn't give you that much  That same girl that talked about her roleplaying  Was pissing outside her car 30 minutes later  That's hot, actually, I like that  But I didn't know that that was Carrie that spoke up  Or I would love to have gotten into her with her  And find out what she was, what kind of roleplay  You blew it, good opportunity  Maybe we'll have to call her to see what she wanted to say at the show  Yeah, I'm kind of  Maybe she's up, well not now  Not at this hour  But I am kind of curious now 
[01:12:00]  She looks very, very good  Yeah, right on  Thanks for insulting my brother after taking a picture of without Flash, Jimmy  I'm sorry  Why are you so rude, Jimmy?  I don't know  They come out to see you, they love you  Speeding up people like that  Anyway, you killed Jimmy, I gotta get to work  Thanks for coming, buddy  No problem  Or Mondo, thank you  We were only in the Mythbusters thing for like 10 minutes  Because it was the end of the day  And they were shooting, she was shooting green screen  No, you were there, you got your picture and that's all you needed  Yeah, you didn't care about anything else 
[01:12:30]  There wasn't much to see, there was a bunch of like the shark on the wall  They had a bunch of stuff, you would have went nuts  Because you would have known what the shows they were from  Of course  But it was just a small little warehouse  And I didn't want to intrude, you know  Too late  Maybe I felt like they actually were working  I was texting her to tell her like we weren't lost  I wasn't hearing back  So I'm like, oh, she must be shooting  Probably like, oh God, this guy won't stop texting me  I'm like, did you get the picture?  Did you get it? 
[01:13:00]  Myth busted  Where else did you guys go in San Francisco?  Well, we got an email, an invite to go to San Quentin prison  That's cool  Yes, and we accepted that  That was what started the whole weekend  I'm like, what am I going to not, because Carrie had invited me  What am I going to not go see Mythbusters?  Am I not going to go see San Quentin?  What am I, a dope?  Yeah, now don't get that mixed up with Alcatraz people  Which is where most people go, Jimmy went to San Quentin 
[01:13:30]  An operational prison  With real prisoners in it  They were real prisoners, one of the CO's is a fan, big fan of the show  He listens every day, so he's probably listening  Chris, he's probably enjoying the show on the way into work  And he offered us a real tour  Is he a bull? Is he one of the bulls?  Yeah, one of the screws  One of the screws?  He's a young guy though, how old is he, 26, 27?  Yeah, he's only been on the job a couple of years  And he got promoted to investigator already  Cool  Kenny had to be in heaven 
[01:14:00]  Was he punched in the face by one of the...  I asked him that, he said yes  He's had his share of...  Feces thrown at him?  No, but he's talked to me  What are they called, gas bombs or something?  Yeah, Jimmy was hoping for the fecal matter  No, I wasn't, I was hoping, I was traveling with it  He, uh...  The fecal matter at hand, it's not very official  You know, he said they let it ferment for a couple of days in a bag or something  And they throw... 
[01:14:30]  It's bad enough, why do you need it to ferment?  I don't know  It's bad enough coming right out of the source  He, uh...  But he was a cool guy and he said that he would take a...  It wasn't like a tourist can't get to do this  You have to know somebody to get this  Are you allowed to even be talking about this?  Oh yeah, yeah, it was okay  He had to get permission from the warden  And it was all in the up and up  So we go there and he goes, no blue jeans and no blue sweatshirts  Because the prisoners wear blue, so you can't get mixed in  That would suck, huh?  Yeah, it would  You'd get mixed up and you're like, ah, nah, I gotta get out of here  Did you have to buy slacks just to go in there? 
[01:15:00]  No, that's what I mean, Kenny had sweats on  But we get there and the guy letting people in, like the guard or whatever  Goes, no, they can't go in with sweats  So Chris goes, okay, I wasn't sure  So they had to walk us back out to the guard house  Why can't you go in with sweats?  I don't know, it was just whatever, the prison rules are weird  They have different colors and different stuff  So they made us put on, like, hospital scrubs  Yeah, green hospital scrubs  So you couldn't get mixed up with anybody  That's probably affiliated with a gang or anything  Yes, unless the gang is called St. Elsewhere  And, you know, we were two leaders of the St. Elsewhere gang 
[01:15:30]  I just wanted to say that joke twice  And I figured out a way to do something  Jesus  We couldn't bring any cameras or cell phones in, of course  You can't  You walk in and it is really scary walking through  Because you have to get stamped and show your ID  And then you're in this open air  What would you call it, a little courtyard?  We were in the yard, yeah, it's called the yard  You know, the rec yard where they all work out  But they weren't, the part of the prison we were in was locked down 
[01:16:00]  Because there's a chicken pox quarantine  Well, you can't go, the one place you can't go is they call ADSEG  Administrative segregation, I guess  The hole?  Yeah, pretty much  I mean, that's where I wanted to go too  Because that's where the Night Stalker is  And Sirhan Sirhan  Were you going to try to get pictures with him?  Scott Peterson  That would have been great, hi, Scott  You touch his arm through the bars  You know that's what he was hoping though  I guarantee Jimmy was over a few pictures  I would love to have had a Sirhan Sirhan shot  But you couldn't get into that building at all 
[01:16:30]  Sirhan Sirhan shot  Why can't you get in that building?  No, they just don't allow anybody except really elite people  Yeah, that's right  You can't play, like the Mexican Mafia, I think leaders  Like the guys, hardcore gang member leaders  You can't play games in there  So we went down into the, around the back of the buildings  With the yard where all the inmates stay  And there was a couple of inmates milling about  But it wasn't like packed because of the quarantine  So he was showing us where all the Latino gangs go  He goes that's where the blacks are, that's where the whites are 
[01:17:00]  Everybody's got their territories  Yeah, wow  I wanted to go and sit on one of the benches  Where the Latino guys are  Because there was none there  But I just figured if somebody saw me through the window  That might be a problem  Because you literally were in the jail  It was like we had one guy with us  And he takes us into the dorms  And we walk into this open, it looks like a basketball court  And there's just 300 prisoners  It used to be a gym because of the overcrowding  Yeah, overcrowding  And there's 300 inmates now living in this gym 
[01:17:30]  And they all just, they just stopped  They're all looking at us  When we walked in  Because you're in there looking at them like  Oh, this is a circus  They must hate that  I don't know, I mean, yes and no  I mean, he said Chuck Liddell went through recently  And they went bananas, they all love Liddell  They're all MMA guys, they're all, he said when they walked down the tier  They were all chanting, like they love Chuck  I bet  And they had, you know, this one was like a more relaxed area where we were  Because these were guys that like, I think were on better behavior or whatever  Because there was just, you know, bunk beds 
[01:18:00]  Minimum security  In this one little, in this room  And he said that the bad part of it, he goes, if somebody wants to do something  In the 3 o'clock in the morning, they can  There's nothing anyone can do to stop them  Nothing can stop them, because if like a Mexican guy or somebody wants to hit you  Or put a lock in a sock, I think it is  Oh, yeah  And they smash you in the face with that while you're sleeping  And you never see it coming  Ow, ow, ow  Dumb private pile  So we were going to go see, we wanted to see 
[01:18:30]  We would have got to walk down the cell block  Because when you walk into this, well, how would you describe it?  The other area we went into  Well, they took us to the one cell block where Death Row is  And we got our pictures outside the gate  It says Condemned Row  Condemned Row  Let me see that picture, that's the one I want to see  Yeah, yeah, and we were going to go, and this is the real place  And we were going to go...  You didn't tweet all these pictures, did you?  No, not yet, I will  Yeah, you should  We were going to go...  Oh, no, I did tweet that one, did I or no?  I didn't see that one, I saw the Golden Gate 
[01:19:00]  The cell block next door, that's the one that you could take visitors in  But that's the one that had the chicken pox quarantine  Yeah, you don't want to be going there  I don't have it on my iPad, I have it in my email  You do not want to be going there  No, there was...  But when you look in the door, here's the...  The Condemned Row is right in front of us  And to the left was a giant steel door  With hundreds of flies just milling about  And when you look in, that was the tear  I mean, the guys could have walked out and we could have walked in  Flies?  But it was just the... 
[01:19:30]  I never had chicken pox, so I couldn't go in there  Oh, no  You don't want prisoner chicken pox  Something tells me, I don't know why, but it would probably be worse  It would be fucking horrendous  And we were going to get to see the gas chamber  That's what I really wanted to see, which is not being used anymore  I really wanted to see the gas chamber  Your pants?  Why couldn't you see that?  Because he got called away to a stabbing  Are you serious?  There was a stabbing that occurred while we were there  And he had to go...  Ruined your visit? 
[01:20:00]  Ruined your little tour  Have you seen the gas chamber?  Yes  Fuck!  And as soon as he got the call  He got to go...  I'm like, they're going to cut this short because he had some real work  Why couldn't you just go off on your own?  I asked him that, I'm like, why don't you let us just wander around?  Yeah  Just mill about  I'm going to go find the gift shop  With the gen pop  Kenny, you forwarded me the photo, right?  Yeah  Nice little shank  Yeah, get a couple trinkets for the people back home  A shank and a snow globe 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, exactly  Well, he took us in...  They have like a little museum there with all, you know, the history and artifacts  Oh, that's cool, really?  All prisoner-made weapons that they've found over the years  Oh, some cool ones?  Oh, yeah, zip guns and fucking...  Yeah, it's amazing the things convicts invent to kill each other with  They had an old ball and chain there, too  Like a mace, kind of a...  Oh, a ball and chain that they wear around their ankles  I thought you meant to wife  Get it? Because...  No, no, no, it wasn't a wife 
[01:21:00]  They made it out of like old cannonballs  And for punishment, they had to walk around with the ball and chain  The ball, the old ball and chain  What a pain in the ass that would be  That would really suck  It was an actual-sized cell  Your thigh muscle is giant from dragging that thing  M-Gro  And it's written in like oldie-style fucking font  Like calligraphy letters almost, right?  Is that calligraphy it's called?  Yeah  And that's, um...  That's the door?  Yeah  To get in?  You walk through this, there's a cage around the door 
[01:21:30]  Boy, they don't want you out  And you have to go upstairs or something like that  Like that was just where the elevator is  Let me see  Pick up phone, automatic dialing  Must be for the governor  Yeah  Hey, quick, pick this up  Oh my god, that's a great picture  Tweet this fucking thing  I'm going to you, I just...  Oh, Kenny emailed it to me  I haven't...  Kenny's smiling for once  He finally found something that makes me excited  Yeah, of course  Think of how many people went through here and died  Yeah, Kenny was just thinking of all the sad families 
[01:22:00]  That have had to make this stop  They showed us like the top secret torture chamber  The top secret torture  Right, we didn't get any...  We didn't have cameras  That was a photo he took for us  He only took pictures of where he was allowed to  But we were down in...  Right...  When you're going between...  When you first walk into the courtyard  Where you see the ad stake building  Where all these high profile criminals are  And all the things for the fallen officers  That were killed there  They look like these little monuments for them  When you go down this driveway around the back  To where the inmate yard is  As you're going down the driveway 
[01:22:30]  There's an old rusted out entrance  And it looks like the entrance to where you store garden tools  But he said that's in the 1800's  Where they were taking torture  Convicts to get the information out of them  Yeah, he said that was a really bad vibe in that room  Wow  Really bad vibe  But yeah, that was really cool shots, right?  With fucking...  Oh my god, yeah  Me and Kenny, and that really is condemned row  Very cool  But I want to go back, man  And he goes, let us have more notice next time  And we will make sure we get a proper tour set up 
[01:23:00]  And I wanted to walk down the cell block  If there's any way you don't want to go  If you're uncomfortable, let us know  We don't have to  You're not a pussy  But I'm like, I would have went anywhere in that prison  Even though it was scary  I still would have done it  You know what?  I could be a friend to you  Yeah, I'm looking for a new punk  Remember Wolf?  Yes, a wolf  The showers in the dorm area where we were  Were all open air showers  And open air toilets  You had no privacy in there, so  Oh boy  The troughed pissing 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, I could never take a shit in there  You'd learn  Yeah, I bet  But I wanted to walk down that fucking  So when I looked through that door  That was right by Condemn Row  If you're standing where Kenny and I are right there  If you look to our right  You can't see it off camera  But that's where this giant black steel door was  Which opened and closed into the actual cell block  And I was... you could see like the cells  And the guys were walking back and forth  I was like, fuck, I wanted to walk through there  That's creepy  Yeah, I would  Would you go?  Yeah, I would do that  Oh yeah  I told him, I'm like open air and go fucking nuts for this place  Because he's a big fan 
[01:24:00]  So I think he would arrange it if you wanted to go out there  That would be cool  I'd get out there once in a while  Next time  Oh hell yeah  We should make a trip  I would take a couple days to go to San Quentin  I thought Alcatraz was cool  Fuck that  I want a prison where people still milling about  Are suffering  Yeah, this was a real deal, man  And I would love to take a real walk through it  It's a whole little trip  Yeah, and he said that it's a weird kind of mutual thing that the convicts have with their guards and vice versa  It's like, you know, there's tension there 
[01:24:30]  But it's like the reason... the convicts could pretty much overrun it whatever they want  There's so many of them  He told us stories about how guys hide things up their ass  I asked, he called it their man purse  That did make me laugh  Man purse  Yeah, we found this other guy's man purse  Oh God  What do they hide up there?  Weapons  Do they give you a list of shit they found up there?  Shanks  Like things that are wrapped in saran wrap and then toilet paper and then more saran wrap  And then they'll shove it all the way up their assholes  Yeah 
[01:25:00]  So they hide dope  And what do they hide... like, when do they take it out?  I guess when they get where it's not in the...  You know, hopefully not when they're in the warden's office  They probably do it when they're alone and it's late  Don't they make them, like, bend over and grab their ankles and check in?  That's why they shove it, like, way up there  Yeah, exactly, it's not hanging out like a fucking rat tail  They're not Manx cats  They're guys hiding drugs in their asshole and weapons  That can't feel good  You'd walk through, though?  When you get one of those stiff duties that can't really make the turn in your colon 
[01:25:30]  That's exactly what it was  You get that uncomfortable feeling  Get the fuck out of here  Although, think about it  I walked through that shit, no problem  Think about it, though  If something happened, you would be a hostage  We absolutely would be a hostage  You would be a hostage  Because we were standing, what, 12 feet away from the guy  I guess we could have spoken to it  Because the one guy had shoes for sale  And these white guys had these sneakers  They just said, for sale  What are you talking about?  The prisoners are just selling shit?  Well, they trade  Two books of stamps  Two books of stamps 
[01:26:00]  So I asked Chris, I'm like, how much is that?  Like, is money good in here?  And he goes, let me find out  And he walked over and he asked the prisoner  And the guy was like, two books  Which I guess means two books of stamps  Two books of stamps?  And he said that the races are all separate there  In the dorm you have white and black and Latin  But I think they're not right next to it  They're not mixed in  And he goes, you don't cut through  Oh, you don't cut through that area  I think I saw that on a documentary once  Where they had a dorm area that was made out of a gymnasium  And stuff  And it's segregated  And yeah, you walk around 
[01:26:30]  You know, it's like, that's the white area  Here's the fucking  Yeah, it's just like lockup  If you ever saw that on TV  Yeah, yeah  You don't mix  So the guy was just hanging out selling sneakers  Yeah, they were just sitting in front of his thing  And it's like, the trust that nobody was just going to take them and walk off  Cause that's like a murderable offense  Yeah, yeah  To take those sneakers  Or at least, you know, you have a fucking  The old sock lock across the teeth treatment  Were the sneakers nice?  They weren't as bad as you'd think  A prisoner's sneakers would be that he's selling 
[01:27:00]  Yeah  They were really nice  But I was going to walk over and just talk about my orthotics  And ask if he had this suggestion  How did he get the sneakers?  Probably a gift  Yeah, he fucked me in the ass  I have an 8x6  If you can handle that  That's a cool experience  It was great  I wanted to walk around the whole thing  But I think he...  I don't know if we could've  Well, we definitely would've seen more  But he had a go  No, no, no, no  Oh, I mean around the entire dorm area  I would love to have taken a circle around 
[01:27:30]  You saw enough  I wonder what people were going to do though  Were they going to yell?  Like...  Would the guys yell?  Would he just let my cat call you or yell at you?  Yeah, yeah  You'd like that, huh?  What do you do?  I would avoid eye contact  Just go, fuck you  Shut up  Ah, you're locked up  You ain't going anywhere  No, they were definitely checking us out  Ah, Blanche!  Yeah!  They were...  Oh, no, they were close enough to run over and grab you if they wanted to  Oh, really?  There was nothing between you and them?  No, we were just standing in the room with them 
[01:28:00]  Wow  That would be a little scary  It's like a giant cafeteria or a giant gym  Yeah, yeah  With bunks and you're...  No, there was no glass or wall between you  You just, you know  The guy walked over and he asked them about the sneakers  That's pretty fucking creepy  I just wish we had gone down that cell block  But he had to go  Yeah, it's creepy  Next time I'm gonna go  I'd go out there for a couple days just to do that  Yeah, yeah  Oh, God  Jesus  What the fuck is that?  San Francisco rules  It is a cool city, isn't it?  It's fucking great, man  There's a lot going on out there  It's a great city  It's one of my favorites  I wanted to hang out there and just eat  Because the seafood's fucking amazing 
[01:28:30]  Seafood eat food  Not down near...  That's a good one  Not down near the piers, though  It's like...  I ate at a couple of places down there  And it's a tourist trap  Yeah, Fisherman's Wharf is a tourist place  Yeah, I didn't dig the seafood down at Fisherman's Wharf  I think they would have amazing seafood  No, we didn't  No, guys, sorry  No, so we didn't do that either  We ate at a couple of good places  We did a lot of walking  It was fun, but we had like a real...  You walk up some of those hills?  No  Hadn't...  We navigated around them  Yeah, you had to 
[01:29:00]  Well, some of those hills, they have stairs right into the sidewalk  That's crazy  It really was just creepy  I'm sorry, I'm yawning  I'm sorry, I'm yawning  There's a lot of walking around for a sweet boy  Yeah  We had like a real walking trip  We were like a couple of queens  Just doing all these things together  Yeah  That's good  I was happy to see that  Because I don't think you guys take advantage of the road at all  A lot of times...  But a lot of times, like when you're in certain places in Cincinnati or Portland  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  But I bet you, if you just got the word out  Even a city like Cincinnati that you would assume has nothing 
[01:29:30]  There's probably some really cool shit you wouldn't even think about  To see  My manager's been obsessed with sending me old airline commercial clips  What?  Just like the ones...  It's kinda cold  Continental when they were like...  Yeah, yeah  And the lounge...  This was in the 70's  They were like, they have the first class lounge  And there's a giant lounge in first class  At Continental Airlines  And like, you could play Pong  And the fucking Pong  Wow  Top game  Oh yeah  It literally just...  One pixel  That was in the first class lounge  It was in the fucking coach lounge 
[01:30:00]  A ball you could roll with each other  But they had a coach lounge and a first class lounge  All those old commercials for planes were great  That the...  What was the airline that had the stewardesses and used to plug them all the time  It's like, yeah, fly me  I'm...  I'm...  Judy, fly me  Yeah, that was the one where...  National, that was national  That was the one where we put the beeps in and it sounded like fuck me  Yeah, it sounded like she was fucking  Speaking of which, I wanna play that Hoda, uh...  Kathleen Gifford beep thing we did on Friday again 
[01:30:30]  Oh yeah, that was a good one  That's worth playing again  I wanna do it to break if we can get a really fast E-Rock or wherever  It's on a CD  But also I wanna do the fly me that Ant was talking about because...  Fly me  Fly me  We know exactly what they're talking about here  It was all about the sexy stews and people smoking on the plane  Ah, fuck it  I had a lousy flight to L.A. recently too  I was taping that metal show and it's just amazing how the airlines are just...  They don't care about you at all  They don't care anymore  They stink  I had lousy flights  What happened? 
[01:31:00]  What's different?  Well, no, it's first of all...  Besides the obvious...  Me and Jimmy are frequent flyers so you build up your miles because you're a loyal customer  So usually I use my miles to upgrade to first class and they don't fucking let you because they're so stingy  They want you to pay, you know, the revenue tickets  But isn't that something they do?  They don't let you...  It's almost impossible to use miles to upgrade  They're never available  Never  It's like they suck you into being a frequent flyer and they just don't live up to their part of the deal 
[01:31:30]  It's enraging  So there's no reason to have any loyalty  No!  And I don't anymore  I don't...  I fly American half the time, Continental half the time  Yeah, whatever's available for the fastest flight  And I got flown...  I'm lucky I get to fly first a lot  But again, it's network contracts  It's all people are flown that way  They don't do that for me  They just do that so when they want to fly, it's in the contract  So I got flown out for that metal show  And I was in first and I'm in the last  And you're not going to garner sympathy from people complaining about first  I understand that 
[01:32:00]  But...  And I didn't even have to pay for the ticket  But I was in the last row of first and the seat doesn't go back as far  I hate that seat  And it's like...  It just annoys me so much  Because the same thing happens in coach in the back  It's like they...  They charge you the same and they just fuck you on the service  So they have certain meals you can choose  So they get to my row and of course the meal I want isn't available  So in coach they have these snack packs  So I ask for one of them and they charge me for it  And I'm like you should be embarrassed  Did you say that?  Did you say that?  Yes! 
[01:32:30]  Good for you  It's like they...  The ticket was like a $2,000 ticket  Which again, luckily I didn't pay for it  Yeah  But it's like...  It's just such a scummy thing  That really is  And if it's first class and you have a choice of meal  It should be a choice for everybody  Not just the first half of the plane  Right  And then they run out  It's just...  It's not just first  They do it in coach  It's just this horrible way of relating to people  And none of them think on their feet  None of these employees should go 
[01:33:00]  You know what?  Yeah, that's right  They didn't have what you wanted  They should've  We'll take care of you  There's none of that  Dude, I flew Continental for years  And then the Tonight Show started flying me American  They're just better  You were pulling cash out of your pocket in first class  No, no cash only  No, no  My credit card  They swiped $11.90  They got me for  What a lousy airline  That's ridiculous  They're just lousy  You got miles out of it  What's that?  Use your Continental credit card  You got miles 
[01:33:30]  Here's the old airline commercial that Ant was referring to  This is what it used to be  Yeah  Fly me to New York  You'll love my two 747s  Oh  Fly me  Fly Maggie  Fly Maggie  You'll love my two 747s  Fly Maggie  Yes, and my hanger between my legs  You know what they're talking about right there, right?  Yes, big tits  It has nothing to do with flying, right?  She has wings like an angel, I thought  No, she's talking about her tits, I think  It's just terrible 
[01:34:00]  Alright, we're gonna go to break  Wow, it sounds like you guys had a great time  Amazing trip, yes  My LA flight was enraging  That's awesome  I thought I was gonna have an  I was so mad  I said to the woman as I was walking  She's like, okay, just give me your credit card  I'm like, you're gonna charge me for that?  I'm like, your airline just sucks  I was so angry  And I went into the bathroom  So when I came out  I had to swipe the credit card  Because again, they want you to pay the same as everybody else  But they don't have the same service  Because that's the way it should be  Right  The same shouldn't get the same service  So they had a male flight attendant next to her 
[01:34:30]  Oh  Like I guess I was considered a problem at that point  They've gotten to the point where  You can't comment about anything  You can't comment  Right, right  About real shit  About lousy service  Right  And people like, when you go in economy  To the back  The last row is against the wall  And it's like, I understand you're a company  And you gotta make a living  You gotta make a living  But how do you screw people  In the back of the plane like that  Like they're right by  A, they're right by the bathroom  Yeah  And B, they can't even recline their seat 
[01:35:00]  And they're like, no, all the seats go back  No, they don't  No, because they shove that extra row in  God, they just have to fuck you  Every foot  They have to fuck you for  Un-fucking-believable  That you have to pay for that  I haven't flown in a while  I don't know what you want  And you're right  Now they have complete control  Because if you're like, you know  This fucking sucks  I'm paying the same price  And I get  Oh, there it is  Problem  Land the plane  FBI  Get everybody on board here  Because he's making a problem  On an airplane  Continental starting economy plus now 
[01:35:30]  Where you can pay more  For a few inches of leg room  Unbelievable  They're just despicable, man  They really are disgusting  The way they  Look, you gotta make a profit  But the more of them that merge  The more they just rape people  Yeah  They rape you  No other options  Ugh  And then I think about Louis C.K.  And I'm like, yeah  I probably shouldn't complain  He's like, you're in a chair  In the sky  And I'm like, I guess he's right  Like a mythical god  Love that bit 
[01:36:00]  We're gonna break with that  Kathy Lee Hoda clip from Friday  Because they were talking about airlines  And bags, remember?  Yes, bags  We love this fucking show, Jimmy  Kathy Lee Gifford and Hoda  Comes on at 10 o'clock  And we get off the air  It's the worst show on TV by far  But we've decided to take their audio  We're gonna, it's gonna be a regular feature  And put beeps in it  So it sounds like these two broads  Are talking about cucks  Cuck  And this one worked out perfectly  First of all  For some reason  I bring a big 
[01:36:30]  On the plane  I wonder what  And it's not too big  Because it fits  If you just jam it  It fits  No one fits  You have to jam everybody else's  I've seen you in action  I politely say  Whose  Is this  And then they say  Mine  And I say  Would you mind terribly  If I just moved it from  To  They look at you  Like venom  It's first come first serve  Okay, wait  You're the last one on  So when you get on  There's no room  To put your  And you have a  And mine's  Hefty 
[01:37:00]  Needs room  Here's the thing  You learn a little discipline in life  And you get rid of the  That's in your  I need all the things in there  Follow the Opie and Anthony show on twitter  Opie  Twitter.com slash  Opie Radio  Anthony  Twitter.com slash  Anthony Cumia  And little Jimmy Norton  Twitter.com slash  Twitter.com slash  Jim Norton  Sirius XM  The Virus  Did you just see that? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah  Just in time as we're coming back  They're starting to promote the Arthur movie  With Russell  Russell Brand  Russell Brand  And we're not fans when they  Of comedies that are remade  Not at all man  Especially when they worked  So well  Perfectly fine the first time  And especially when they feel timeless  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You can pop Arthur on today  And it would still work  Yes, I brought a few other cars  So why are they remaking it?  Yeah, why  Why can't they make another character  That's sort of like an Arthur character 
[01:38:00]  But make it their own?  But Russell Brand is remaking Arthur  He's a funny guy  I gotta give it to him  And then they had the scene in the hospital  Where what's his name is dying there?  Help me out  It was John Gielgud  Yeah, but what was his character?  In the movie  I forgot  And he was dying and he had the cowboy hat on  Right?  Bitterman was the uh  He was the uh  Chauffeur  Yeah, he put the cowboy hat on  In the original movie  If I begin to die, please remove  Exactly  Yeah  Well the new movie  Hopkins  Hopkins 
[01:38:30]  Hopkins  Hopkins  Not Hobson  Hobson, thank you  Hobson  Thank you, whoever came up with that  Someone got Hopkins and put us on to Hobson  So you suck  Okay  So they remade the scene for the trailer  It's in the trailer  And he's wearing a Darth Vader mask  Yeah  In the hospital room  We have the official trailer  Oh good, I wanna see this  I wanna see this  I haven't seen this yet  Cause that's the first time I've seen anything from the new Arthur  What?  What's up?  Oh yeah, cause you would have a problem with this  Yeah, Jimmy's in the bathroom  He's probably not gonna like this  You know what? 
[01:39:00]  We can do a couple things  We're eager beavers  We can do a couple things  We'll do the Arthur trailer in a second  But for Anthony  Uh, Kyoto  Oh  Is that a town in Japan?  Yes  Okay, Kyoto  Uh, fuel rods at number two reactor of uh Fukushima  Number one nuke plant now fully exposed  Uh oh  Is that bad?  Yeah  That's a bad one  And there's a guy  I gotta thank  Here's a guy  I gotta thank Andy Levy  He's, Andy Levy knows where to go for news 
[01:39:30]  I know  He really does  He's got sources and contacts too  That just text him or tweet him  And he's like, you know  He's in the know  Well, he turned me and a lot of other people onto this guy on Twitter  It's W7VOA  Yeah  And I guess this guy is big time in the know  And getting info way before the mainstream media that we are aware of  Yeah  Like CNN, Fox, and what have you  Yeah, this guy's the go-to guy  This guy is getting most of the stuff first  And then it filters out to everyone else 
[01:40:00]  And you can follow him on Twitter  It's W7VOA  And I want to thank Andy Levy for that  But he is saying this guy  He is saying this guy  Kyoto  Fuel rods at number two reactor of Fukushima  Number one nuke plant now fully exposed  You want to explain that to us, Sam?  Yeah, that means that there's nothing cooling it  And nothing keeping it from having a giant reaction with the other rods  And melting  Melting  Meltdown  Yeah  That's called your meltdown 
[01:40:30]  That shit gets hot  So, and I'm sure CNN and all them will have this in another hour or so  But this just came in  Yeah, you're supposed to keep those underwater  Okay  Underwater  It's fully exposed  Yeah  Jimmy, we started talking about the Arthur trailer  And then we said we better wait for Jimmy to get back  They just showed, as we were getting back from break  Russell Brand in the hospital room  Yes  Remember the famous scene in the original Arthur?  Sure  But instead of the cowboy hat  You know, Hobson  John Fader, right 
[01:41:00]  Oh, you've seen it?  Yeah, I thought the trailer was actually pretty good  Am I crazy?  I haven't seen it yet  It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be  But  I haven't seen it with the sound  We're still not fans of comedies being remade, right?  I agree  Yes  So I'm really bothered that they're remaking Arthur  I saw this preview, this trailer, and I'm like  There's no way it could be good  And I watched it and I was like, you know what?  Oh no  I can't say  The trailer didn't look bad  You may have a different take on it though  But it was  Alright, let's take a look at this  The new Arthur with Russell Brandt  Who obviously is a funny guy  You gotta give it to him 
[01:41:30]  We used to know him  Yeah, no kidding  And we even said what would happen and he laughed at us  No, he didn't laugh at us  He said, yeah, that's exactly what's going to happen  No  Bitterman, open the door  Bitterman, close that door  Get in the car  Not you, Bitterman  Who are you people?  I'm his nanny  I'm not, I'm Bitterman  I hate the music  Morning Arthur  Yeah  Hello Hobson  Say goodbye to your friends now, Arthur  Make me  Ow  Hobson  Get on the horse 
[01:42:00]  No, it's okay  Maybe daddy could help  Let me  Ow, but you're not qualified  Please  That was no trouble  You're going to marry Susan Johnson  Hello Arthur  Hello Arthur  Ah  What was that?  French kiss  Really?  Because the French always surrender  That was decidedly German  Your mother will see you now  Arthur, to what do I owe the pleasure?  I don't want to marry Susan  Fine  You are cut off  Cut off from the...  The money  I think I could live without the money 
[01:42:30]  I am a grown man and I shall get a job to prove it  Don't let that undermine what I just said  We should not get married  It's a business partnership  Is that like that?  We don't have anything in common  You love horses  I don't trust them  Their shoes are permanent  Who makes that kind of a commitment to a shoe?  We get on you  Do you know how to use Excel?  No  PowerPoint?  No, I'll look  Generally positive  You know, I mean I have down days like anyone, but...  Let me look after you 
[01:43:00]  How does this bag of tea work?  It's obvious  Be careful, it's going to be very, very...  John, no!  Hot  Are you running from yourself, are they?  I wish I was, because I'd let me get away  Put this on, please  Say, wash your winky  Wash your winky  Could you do chewy?  Hobson  We're going to hang out together  And they made hearts in a woman  You never hung out in my life  And I'm not going to start tonight  Hobson  He's weak  He's stronger than you think 
[01:43:30]  You used to say  I thought  You could do anything under the sun  I never spoke like that  It was a bit like that  Do you like it?  Meow  On the bag, kitty  Stop!  My bed is made of magnets  Get me out of here  At least something in this room is attractive to you  Um...  Benjamin?  Why are you shaving?  Because Robin doesn't have a beard  I can see your tummy  I can see your tummy 
[01:44:00]  Oh my god  Can I start?  Please let me start  Yeah, go, go  I hate it  And the number one reason I hate it  He's not drunk  He's not a drunk in this movie  Which is Arthur  Hey, wait a minute  He is not drunk  What they're doing is he's a fuck-up  He's a rich kid fuck-up  But he's not a drunk  Whoa, I didn't even realize that  That drives me fucking nuts  I think he is  They probably didn't show it in the trailer  I think he is though  You sure?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Because they're obviously blowing it off in the trailer  Yeah  He didn't look drunk in any scene  He didn't look drunk in any scene 
[01:44:30]  He looks like, yeah  There was one scene that he sort of sounded like  Like Arthur, drunk  Right  I'm starting to think that he's not drunk  He's just a fuck-up  Because it's bad to show somebody drunk having fun  It would be very bad  Right, yeah  I think he is a drunk, but  I don't know  You think he is?  Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure  Can we...  They gotta be talking about the movie somewhere  I need to know now  I watched the trailer again  I didn't like it as much  I didn't like the way the...  And the music  Oh, well that's the trailer  That's what trailers do  That's what trailers do  Yeah, yeah  I also noticed 
[01:45:00]  I hate that they gotta make Hobson a woman  That's...  Whatever  Also, they...  It's kind of the same basic storyline  But it looks like they redid everything  Well...  Like, which is good  They're not trying to use the same jokes  Remember when they redid the Brady Bunch  But they went over the top with it and made fun of it?  Yes  If they're...  That's...  If they're doing that, then awesome  I would love to see this movie  You know what I mean?  Yeah  If they're kind of spinning it and going  Alright, we're gonna make fun of the whole Arthur thing  I think they were doing a little tribute 
[01:45:30]  Kind of funny thing to John Gielgud too  In that one scene where he said  You sounded like this  He goes, I never sounded like this  Because that's kind of like, you know  John Gielgud sounds like that  Yes, he did  Alright  A drunken playboy stands to lose a wealthy inheritance  When he falls for a woman his family doesn't like  Yeah, that's the first one  Like, it sounds like the first one  How drunk is he?  It could be implied drunkenness  Or is he gonna be drinking and bah  With the drink out the window  Driving in the car 
[01:46:00]  Russell Brand was...  He was in control  Yeah  He looked like he was just more of a fuck-up  I didn't see him staggering  They...  Which is even worse if they're blowing that angle off for the trailer  To try to, you know, keep it all friendly  Yeah, they should show him drunk  They should show him drunk  Now I'm really confused which one it's gonna be  But Helen Mirren  Oh my god, let's see her naked  Really?  No  Yeah  But you can see her naked in Caligula  No broad  I wanna see the old version naked  Ew  Ew  Ew  Ew 
[01:46:30]  Um  I was gonna say something and I forgot  I just hate when they remake comics  I agree  I typically don't like it either  Because I mean Russell Brand can play...  He can play just a different character that's sort of similar to that  Why not?  And the difference is like in the original Susan  The woman he was supposed to marry  Is...  Was proper  Prim proper  Prim proper  Boring  And then Liza Minnelli  Is the star  Who's the average looking woman  Right  But who really sweeps them off his feet with her personality  Yeah  And she was great in that movie  Who's playing Liza in this movie? 
[01:47:00]  A girl named Greta  But they don't like show her at all in the trailer  Fran Sustrand  Not at all  And what about Liza's father?  That was...  That's Nick...  Oh  That shit was hilarious in Arthur  I think Susan's father is Nick Nolte in this  Um  Okay  But they...  The Susan is played by Jennifer Garner  And from what I hear her she's...  She's good in it  And it's like...  It's hard to convince somebody that you're not gonna wanna fuck Jennifer Garner forever  Uh...  Especially if she has a personality  Yeah  But they didn't show the... 
[01:47:30]  They changed the storyline a little bit  Because they didn't show the other girl at all in this  Greta  Hmm...  Well we'll have to wait and see  When is that movie coming out?  Another month or so?  April  April  Uh oh  Coming in April  Uh oh  What?  Is that bad movie time?  Oh yeah it is  Coming out...  Coming out before the summer releases?  Never good  Rooter  They saved the good ones for the summer  Uh oh  Uh oh  Oh boy  What does that mean? 
[01:48:00]  Uh oh  Yeah we used to have Russell on the show  Remember those days?  Yeah  He won't be drunk in the movie because it's PG-13?  Then he can't remake...  I think he can show somebody drunk  A little bit  Maybe uh...  I think it's gotta be too politically correct  I think so too  I don't think we're gonna be seeing a very drunk um...  No  Arthur  Playboy-ish  Maybe there'll be a drink in his hand  I don't even think he can show a drink in his hand in a PG-13 if you're looking for a big audience 
[01:48:30]  Yeah  Hope it doesn't happen  Who knows  We'll be following that one closely  Hey uh... you hear what Larry Kudlow said  Who?  About the tsunami  Oh yeah I know that  What?  Yeah this is not good  Uh oh  This was a little slip up  Oh boy  Someone in trouble?  Someone apologizing?  Ah there is an apology yeah but here we go  Look at the S&P bouncing back  It's up about four tenths of a percent  All in all the market taking this in stride  I mean the human toll here looks to be much worse than the economic toll 
[01:49:00]  Oh wow  Okay that probably wasn't the best way to put it  Oh back up  Listen to this, this is really kind of bad  The human toll here looks to be much worse than the economic toll  And we can be grateful for that  And the human toll is a tragedy, we know that  But these markets, all these markets, right?  Stocks, commodities, oil, gold  There is no major breakout or breakdown 
[01:49:30]  As the traders told us, oil is very much a part of this today  Because oil is moving lower  Oh boy  He just, he just mixed up, he meant to say the uh  I don't think he meant to say that at all  No  I think he meant exactly what he said  Yeah and he got caught  The human toll, who is he saying it to?  The human toll is greater than the economic toll, which is a good thing  Like thinking, because he's just talking money  No  Yeah  Nobody would say that on TV  He'd be fucked up  Hey  Guaranteed  There you go, we got a reporter  Oh, he's up to his ankles, yeah 
[01:50:00]  Is it ankles or knees?  Is it a reflection?  Yeah, I think it's a reflection  John Huddy, locally here on Fox  He's standing in some water today  Yes  I think if you listen to New Jersey  Yeah, in Jersey, yes of course  I think if you listen to what he said  You got Anderson Cooper trying to figure out if he should leave  Because the radiation cloud is coming toward him  Then you got this local asshole and water up to his ankles  Because there's some flooding in Jersey  Flooding in Jersey  If you listen to what that guy said, he absolutely meant what he said  Yeah, of course  Yeah  Well, it's CNBC, because they think about economics all the time  Money, money 
[01:50:30]  Not human lives  Yes  I guess he apologized later on Twitter  Oh, did he?  He apologized on Twitter  Oh, what did he say?  I apologize  Did he say that? I didn't mean to say that? Or it came out backwards?  I honestly don't follow a boar like that, so I don't know  Nah, it just says that he apologized on Twitter  Now we got a radio guy in trouble in Montreal  Oh, what did he do?  Ha, ha, ha  Montreal  Montreux  Ha, ha, ha  Montreux  Ha, ha, ha  Ha, ha  Ha, ha, ha 
[01:51:00]  What did he do?  Um, he cursed  Oh  Oh  Which, by the way, it's tough to play  It's because we're on satellite where we can curse  But you gotta understand  Yeah, remember  A lot of places you still can't curse on the radio  And this guy, Marco Campagna, I guess  Curses up a storm after the computer messes up on Montreal's 990 AM  Well, there's a computer problem, you gotta come  You gotta come  Fuck  Fuck  Fuck  Fuck  Visit adstandards.ca 
[01:51:30]  Fuck, man  Ha, ha, ha  Everything's broken in this fucking place  I can't even play a spot right now  Cause the fucking phone is ringing  And I can't see the screen when the phone rings  Fuck  Now we have dead air  It's the French version of me  This sounds exactly like, like, this place  Yeah, the fucking, they don't have a fucking skill set  Ha, ha, ha  This is with a French accent  The fucking phone is ringing  And I can't see the screen when the phone rings 
[01:52:00]  Fuck  Now we have dead air  Fuck  No, you don't  Sapping on Sunday mornings at 6  Supersize your sports knowledge  As Gary Whittaker and Nick Merdaco host the franchise  The franchise gives you a three-hour head start on everything you need to know  To face the day with a well-rounded outlook on the night before  And the day ahead  All delivered like a delicious pizza by the two guys  Who aren't happy  Unless they're biting off more than they can chew  Nick Merdaco  Gary Whittaker  The franchise 
[01:52:30]  Jesus  Isn't it funny that like  How, did he get fired?  I don't know  I don't think they care about  Fuck that bad up there  Just don't say fuck  And then put like a race in front of it  And you're fine in Canada  Yeah, just don't say fucking Jew  Yeah, yeah  Probably right  Yeah  So, but that's always fun to listen to  Oh yeah, somebody melting down  Someone that was in their fucking mind  Exactly  Uh, just kinda going through some things here  Michael Mattson  Who was just on our show  Oh yeah  Oh my god  Turns out that he's, uh, he's dodging a lot of people 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, he seems to be  Maybe not a lot of people  Yeah, maybe a lot of people  Cause you know more about this story than I have in front of me, right?  Oh, I know a little bit of everything  You have the Tarantino angle that I don't really see in here  Yes, yes  And, uh, Pierce Brosnan  He borrowed money off of  Really?  Yeah, he filed for bankruptcy a couple of years back  Uh, and I, I guess he doesn't have to pay them back now  But he borrowed, uh, a few hundred thousand from Pierce Brosnan 
[01:53:30]  And borrowed a million dollars from Quentin Tarantino  And hasn't paid those things back  And hasn't paid, hasn't paid it back  Uh, he's $500,000 deep in child support and, uh, spousal support payments  So they issued a warrant for his arrest  Uh, and he's, uh, he's on the lam, I guess, right now  Oh, my God  Can we get him on the phone?  He's so good  It's like, what the fuck is he doing?  We love him  He's becoming a friend of the show  He seemed like he was in a good place when he was in here a mere week or two ago  We know he has to make a lot of movies  Oh, that's why he's pumping out those movies 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, he played his hand a while ago  And said, look, I'm making these movies  Cause I got a, I got bills to pay and a mortgage to pay  Madsen issued a arrest warrant after missing court hearing on child support  And, uh, like you said, spousal support  Uh, arrest warrant  Failing to show up, uh, to a hearing about his spousal and child support debts  Yeah, $570,000 in the hole, like Ant said  Skipped out on a hearing about the sum  Oof  And his bail is set at $26,000 if they get him  Michael Madsen in trouble 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, that's, uh, that's a shame  Where did all his money go?  He has killed Bill of money  Shit, too many kids though  Kids, ex-wife, fuckin' maybe some bad investments  Oh, a lot of them do  The business, a lot of business managers, man, are so  I keep my eye on fuckin' everything  Every dime  I go online, I check my account  Yeah  All the time, man  Make sure my taxes are paid  Yeah, you got it  I don't go over every tax thing  But I, I add up my totals  I go over all my shit, my receipts  I fuckin' pour over it 
[01:55:00]  I mean, it's like you have to know what you're doing  So you don't want it broke  Yeah  Yeah, absolutely  Oof  Yeah, he's, uh, looks like he's gonna be pumping out more of those movies  Poor guy  Yeah, that sucks  Just had him in  Yeah  Seemed happy, right?  Yeah, he probably still is happy  He doesn't seem like a guy that, uh  Gives a fuck  Is bothered by a lot of that shit  Yeah, that's a good point  Whatever  And our, uh, our boy Gallagher's doing well  That turned out to be a minor heart attack  We had that story on Friday  Was it? 
[01:55:30]  Minor heart attack  He's already out, back on the road  He's  Oh my god  I don't even think he missed a gig  Jesus  He's been released from the Minnesota hospital  Where he was treated for a minor heart attack  Did you see the video, Jimmy?  I did not, no  Gallagher in the middle of, uh, smashing shit  Drops  Oh no, I, I saw the photo of it  And then some asshole  Who finally has a reason to be videotaping something  Is all shaky with the camera  And he's, he's fucking filming  People are terrible at that  People are terrible at that  They're such dummies, aren't they?  You finally have an opportunity  Will you keep your camera still? 
[01:56:00]  But he's out of the hospital  And he suffered a heart attack ten years ago as well, so  He needs a smaller sledgehammer  Exactly  Might be a little too heavy for him now  A little too heavy these days  Hammer-o-matic  He is 67  Is he really?  Yup  He doesn't look 67, right?  Gallagher's almost fucking 70  Yup  Jesus  He doesn't look it  So he's back out doing his  He's not doing the gigs he used to do though  The major gigs  Nice  No, this looked like a little shit club in fucking  Where was it?  Minnesota  Somewhere 
[01:56:30]  He used to have  He did a lot of specials, man  Yeah, yeah  Back in the day  He would fill up fucking huge places  Theaters, yeah  Theaters, yeah  He'd have showtime specials like  Every fucking six months  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Very prolific writer  So the tide came back in in Japan  And there was a thousand bodies in the water  Yeah, that's the thing  So the tsunami pulls them all out  And then throws them back on shore  Throws them back  And the tide comes in  And they throw them back on shore  They're estimating about a thousand 
[01:57:00]  Washed up on shore  I'm not sure  Yeah, there's gonna be tens of thousands of dead Japanese people  It'll make a hundred thousand  A hundred and eighty thousand  Flee as Japan's new plant crisis intensifies  Yeah, that uncovered fucking core  Will that shit fuck up Tokyo?  Or is Tokyo far enough away?  All depends on which way the wind's blowing  But, uh, yeah  On the map it doesn't look that far away  I mean, that thing could fuck up  That thing could fuck up  The world  A lot of shit  Yeah, all around the  It gets up in there 
[01:57:30]  And  Third largest economy  And you got radiation floating around  Just starts  Can't be good for the world  Floating around the world  God, we're just gonna poison ourselves eventually  We're just gonna  We're just gonna pollute our water and our air  To the point where we can't even survive anymore  Just another extinct life form  Oh, of course  Remember humans?  Yeah  Yeah, I remember that  They fucked it up  We think it was a meteor  No, they just fucked it up  They'll be like, we think it was a meteor  No  There's no record of their existence  No, they decided to poison their own air and water those dummies 
[01:58:00]  Big ship just going backwards down a street  Right  Where do you see that?  I don't know  I just looked up there's a giant ship  Going backwards down a street  You know what I feel bad for?  That movie Battle for L.A.  Oh, yeah  Who's gonna watch that one just to watch the real shit on TV?  Oh, great  They have the worst timing ever  Some people said they have great timing  No  No, Battle L.A. is a  That's fake  And you get the real shit  Terrible  Like Ann said, you get to see a huge ship just fucking floating down where a street used to be 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, giant ship, not a boat  Not a pleasure craft  And then you got this nice explosion with massive chunks going, it looks like a quarter mile in the air  Yup  Why would you  Amazing, right?  Why would you see the movie when you could see the real life version?  See the real deal  I, uh...  I'm a pilot  I belong up there  Fighting for the tsunami  Yeah  That came on yesterday, Independence Day  And I read a lot of tweets from people that say they can't watch it anymore 
[01:59:00]  It's now a comedy  How about how awful was, uh...  Randy Quaid stinks  He was so fucking bad in that  Just...  Oh, over the top  Yes, sir, Mr. President!  Like, why is this fucking asshole involved in this?  Killing the aliens  We...  We...  We...  We...  I'm a pilot  They need me up there  Oh, good  Hopefully you'll test good in front of a focus group 
[01:59:30]  Guess there's no...  Fucking asshole  There's no way I could talk you out of this  Why don't we get on the horn and let everyone know how to take down these sons of bitches  Yuck  Randy Quaid helping the president  What a douchey fucking movie  Tell my family I love them  Tell them yourself  You fucking asshole  Land your shit plane  Let the military do it  Crop dusting in one fucking scene 
[02:00:00]  And the next  He knows how to fly and operate an F-18  Yeah, and he has access to the president as aliens are coming  Yeah, I'm sure the president is easy to get next to for a photo  While some dumb stripper is fucking finger popping his wife  Fucking bricks around his head  Fucking movie stunk on ice  It's just, I cannot get enough of hating that movie  Oh, it's atrocious  And like Patrice was saying last week  I was all in  It could have been a great movie 
[02:00:30]  But they...  But the...  The unfunny, uncreative fucking pussies that they are in Hollywood ruin it every time they ruin it  But they didn't ruin it  But they didn't ruin it  I mean it made a shit load of money for everybody involved  But I'm saying for what I would like  They make a lot of money  But I mean...  Yeah  They ruined it to me like what I would have enjoyed  Yeah, I absolutely agree  But for some reason enough dummies went and saw it  I knew they enjoyed it  Well we all did  I'm part of the dummy  I was enjoying it  I'm like please just don't let them wreck it  Don't let them wreck it  I'm enjoying this  Don't let them wreck it  Oh, you wrecked it  And those motherfuckers wrecked it 
[02:01:00]  What?  You're supposed to punch aliens in the face  Oh...  No you didn't  It's only way to stop  Welcome to Earth  Why don't you have them just soft shoe?  Why don't you have them fucking dance down some steps behind Shirley Temple?  Every...  It's fucking annoying  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah  Exactly, yeah  Put them in a Cab Calloway white suit  Let us sing Mini the Moocher as the white people fight aliens  If you're gonna make the guy shuck and jive, do it for real  Yeah  Every fucking fighter pilot I've ever seen that's a black guy on real documentaries and stuff 
[02:01:30]  Are the most well-spoken  Yeah  Wonderfully analytical and calm, cool, collected people  Yeah, they're fighter pilots  They're fighter pilots  They're not going like  Yeah, I be shooting missile up his ass, yo  No, he's very fucking articulated in the ways of the FAA team  Yeah, I've locked in the target  Yeah  Yeah  Is that a black guy?  No gives me dat in the  Yeah  Gives me dat tone  I need tone 
[02:02:00]  Gives me dat  No gives me dat in the cockpit  You know, it continues to  Gives me dat  No TNB  It continues to this day  Yeah  Because I know we did the independence thing for  Oh yeah  Solid hour or whatever  But Chris S. from Shirley says it continues today  Battle Los Angeles had same douchey ending with  Get on the horn  Oh, if you don't want the spoiler  Well, I'm sure  Jesus  But I think you can figure out how this movie ends  But it says  Get on the horn around the world  And tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down 
[02:02:30]  They don't say that in the movie  That's what this guy's saying  If someone could back up Chris S.  That's the exact same line  That's what he's saying  It continues to this day  He's gotta be goofing  Because that's verbatim  That's verbatim  Unless they did a tribute  A tribute  To a bad line in another movie  He's probably fucking around  There's no way  I think what he's saying is  Battle Los Angeles had the same douchey ending  Maybe as that  As that maybe  Okay  Can we see Robin Lowe just say that  Or is it hard to find  There's a bunch of people that have seen the movie  So please back Chris up  If it's something like that 
[02:03:00]  Robin Lowe is your line  Yeah, Danny will find it  I'm sure  Dude, there was some fucking horrible lines  Randy Quaid was a wasted character  I'm the primer pilot  Like the president's  Oh, shut up  No, you're not  Hey fellas  I'm back  Fucking  I hated him  As he's flying his plane  Ballistic  At zero speed  I hate characters like that in movies  I fucking  Oh, I know  You don't think it's enough  That aliens have attacked 
[02:03:30]  The White House in New York  Isn't that enough?  We don't need more  No, we really don't  We really don't  I don't need a wacky guy  No, we apparently we didn't  We needed the wacky guy  Who was abducted  That movie sucked my ball bag  My oniony bag  It drained the onion flavor out of my bag  That movie  We should do a Beavis and Butthead  And watch the whole fucking thing  Comment about it  Really, really take that apart 
[02:04:00]  But if we had a nice visual element for our show  We could do that  I know, right?  We were working on that down the hall  I hope they didn't just like  I have a great suggestion  That if people are all in on it  I will write up a treatment for it  Please  Oh, well  What is it?  I mentioned it in the meeting  But I'll tell you off air  Oh, it's a real thing?  Oh, yeah  Oh  Possibility  I thought it was more of boats down there  Oh, my coffee table book  No, you know what it is?  Boats down there  The hard part is each one 
[02:04:30]  Could you make that book?  I'm going to  It would sell so well  And piss off so many people  That you came up with a book called  Boats down there  It's going to be a book  Boats down there  They're going to be about  Two and a half feet by three and a half foot photographs  Heavy, thick construction paper photographs  And just fuck over your own fan base like you said  And you don't tell them how big the book is  You kind of blew it already  Until they get to the book signing  And now they have to carry this giant book home  There's three pictures in it 
[02:05:00]  It's very heavy  $179  $179  And I'll sign it for $20  They can't even get it in a cab on the way home  You're just bothering everybody  Boats down there  With your giant book called  The title stinks  Boats down there  What does that even mean?  You know what?  There are boats down there  Don't talk about it much  But when you have a kid  And you see these  When you see these fucking kid books  I wouldn't be surprised if there's one out there called Boats down there  I'm sure there is  I'll come in with the titles of some of the books my kid has 
[02:05:30]  It's ridiculous  And it goes back to that Brian Regan bit  Yeah, yeah  Where they're all making a bloody  The clock  Bloody fortune off books that have nothing in them  Tick tock  Nothing of substance  No  You know, I hate to be a complainer  But  What happened?  God, I asked for that soup a long time ago  You did?  Who went?  I know we're short handed and everything  But I asked for that like a  Had to be over an hour ago  It was  No one listens to you anymore  I don't think they do  And it bothers me  Well, you know what? 
[02:06:00]  The company  Hot soup!  The company thinks that it's perfectly fine not to have interns  Yeah, to have no interns  For a high profile radio show  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, they punish us for something that might have happened  I don't get it  Why punish us?  We had nothing to do with it  I don't know  The fucking logic  I gotta sit here and whatever  Hey, uh  Anthony gets the soup  Anthony gets his soup  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me  Did they forget?  I don't know  Was the soup thing forgotten?  We'll find out 
[02:06:30]  Kenny?  What's the story with the soup, Kenny?  I'm sorry to report that now that the weather's warming up a little  They're not having the soup ready as early as they used to  Oh, it's not an issue on this end  What the fuck is that about?  That's stupid  I don't know  Soup's delicious no matter how warm it is outside  What else do they have that's on soupy?  By the way, that's a great title for a bumper sticker  Soup's delicious no matter how warm it is outside  Perfect, let's get those made too  Nobody would want that on their car  What?  We'll hand them out 
[02:07:00]  Not even soup people  We'll hand them out for free at your book signing for books down there  Yeah, maybe the soup Nazi will come  Hey, I'm at that chain  Fucking temperamental dickhead  And then the cunt would give us one soup that we had to share every day  Oh, he sucked  He was so stingy with his soup  I know  We're your big advertisers  Get us some  Fuck, get us some soup  And he'd give us the shittiest soup too  Yeah, the one that wasn't selling  Like the broccoli  The broccoli and cheese  Or whatever it was  Yeah  Like fuck that, where's the turkey chili bitch?  I'm so glad we could finally talk about this asshole 
[02:07:30]  I don't want the toenail armpit sweat soup  With fucking little hair follicles in it  It was the soup guy from Seinfeld obviously  Soup Nazi  Soup Nazi  He opens up a bunch of chains  Most of them have gone under  Yes they have  You see one every once in a while if you travel  And we're like  Hey guy  We're doing the live reads  But we don't know how your soup tastes  So can you bring some samples for us every day?  Yeah  And he got really mad  And he would only give us like one soup  Like  And shitty  Lousy choices  He's lousy  It wasn't the turkey chili that we wanted 
[02:08:00]  Remember?  Every day we're like  Could you just give us some fucking turkey chili soup?  Turkey chili  They don't have turkey chili down there?  They do sometimes  See, I'm not allowed to leave  You know, I have to stay at my post  Sure, sure  Yeah  You know, but if I was allowed to go down there  I would give them a nice gratuity  Yeah, right, right  By the way, he says that to people  Do you understand?  We're getting out of a cab  And Kenny goes  Hold on a second  I want to give you a nice gratuity  He always tells people 
[02:08:30]  He's going to give them a nice gratuity  And you know it's only 10%  Oh, it's never a good gratuity  On a $7 fair  No, no, I got to give him the celebrity tip  Because Jimmy's there  Celebrity tip  Yeah  Nice  That's 11%  Yeah, I like it  And that's my new CD  Here's Despicable  Whatever fucking tongue you're babbling in  Here's Despicable  You can eat it  Jimmy's not stingy  He likes to spread it around  That's right  By it I mean my cum  Jesus  Spread it around like butter  Brian in North Carolina  What do you got on the kid book thing? 
[02:09:00]  Hopi  My kid has a 35 page book  That takes me about 4 and a half minutes to read  And it leaves me about 25 minutes to figure out  What else would do before I have to put him to bed?  At least your kid pays attention  My kid pays attention for one or two pages  And then decides he needs to eat the book  And that's it?  Yeah, then he has to eat it  Eat it  I eat that shit  And he decided yesterday that shampoo tastes good  That was exciting  He's probably not wrong  Is it Johnson's baby shampoo? 
[02:09:30]  No  That is delicious  We had a lot of visitors at our house the last few days  And somebody  I'm just going to throw it out there  Yeah  We had a big shampoo and a big conditioner in the bathtub for their usage  Yeah  And it has a pump  So someone that we had in our house in the last 3 or 4 days  Wasn't smart enough to use the pump  So what did they do?  They unscrewed the top  So I'm watching my kid for literally seconds  I turn my head  And I turn back  And he basically has the pump part out 
[02:10:00]  And he puts it in his mouth  What the fuck?  Kids just don't know what they're doing  But see, that's your job as a parent  You go into it understanding that  Right  But what you learn is  Fucking adults  Adults don't know what they're doing  No  Look, we have a kid in the house  Figure it out  Keep everything tight for us  Sorry  Sorry  Oh, God  I saw your nephew at F.H. Riley's though  Little Warren 
[02:10:30]  Kid's getting big  He's getting big, yeah  He's yapping a lot  I don't even think his parents knew I was there  I saw them from afar  And I couldn't get to them to say hi  Oh, yeah?  Yeah  But  Donnie and Patrick  Oh, this is where we're going  Because that's all nonsense, obviously  Were you in when we had Snoop on the air?  I was not  From the wire?  Snoop  I'm crying, I missed that  You weren't here  I was arrested  It was me and Ann  Yeah  She gave us a great interview, man  And we even talked about how, you know, you're not acting  This is  You're a tough broad from the streets 
[02:11:00]  So mad I missed that  And she got swept up in a drug raid, man  Snoop from the wire  Felicia Pearson, her name is  Shocked to be facing charges of conspiring to sell her hair on  Her attorney said Friday  She's a little bit dismayed at being in a position that she didn't place herself in  I don't know what that means  She's probably  Maybe it had nothing to do with her and she was there in the wrong place  She might have been wrong place, wrong time  One of 64 people charged  Yeah  So she got arrested 
[02:11:30]  64?  Where?  Baltimore?  Yeah, Baltimore  Yeah  There's some shit going on in Baltimore  Yeah  So I guess she's saying, look, man  I have nothing to do with this  But of course that's what you would say, right?  That's the I ain't did nothing  I ain't did nothing  I ain't did nothing  I ain't did nothing  Is that different than the  Gibbs Madat?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Oh, yeah  And then there's Madicken  What is that one?  Madicken is what happens  That's like rape or incest 
[02:12:00]  Shit like that is Madicken  And then there's, you know  I can't say it  But when someone freaks out  Like whenever you see that  Like the camera inside a  Inside a Burger King or a McDonald's  And someone's freaking out  Some woman in the order didn't get right  And she weighs like 400 pounds  And she's freaking out  That's called something too  Oh, boy  Freaking out is it called?  Well, it's got out in it  It's got out in it  But it's called something else  Yes, a lot of people that I'm reading here 
[02:12:30]  That I'm reading here seem to know exactly  Of course they do  And there's TNB  What's that?  It's a  It's a gossip website  Oh  It's typical  Yeah  It's typical  And then the N-word behavior  So people call it TNB  And then they give an example  These are all on racist websites  That me being  Me being  I like  Racist  No  I like looking at what's going on in the world 
[02:13:00]  I like knowing who's getting along  And who's not  And why they are  I'm a student of society  And they come up with a lot of different terminology  For black people and what they do  And things as such  And black people do also  They come up with things about white people  That are, you know, pretty hysterical  Hysterical  I watch those goddamn  Those black Jew guys 
[02:13:30]  Black Israelites  Black Israelites  Black Jew guys  Black Jew guys  Jesus  The black Jew guy  Hey, Jew boy  Prejudice against the black Israelites  His day and age  And they just  They really are inciting  Out there on the sidewalk  And when white people come up  And start yelling back at them  They try to get the black people  That are in the crowd around watching them  To perpetrate violence on the white person 
[02:14:00]  Because they won't do it themselves  But they're like  Why don't you take care of this man?  Why don't you take care of him?  You see what he's doing?  You know, so they try to incite  If I went up in Times Square  And started some kind of anti-black babble  I would be arrested in a second  I wish I had the guts to do this  I would love to see footage of somebody  Standing in front of them laughing  Like they were watching a comedy show  Like just fucking howling  You probably could find that  But not angrily 
[02:14:30]  Right  But like genuinely enjoying it  Like ah ah ah  Clapping and laughing  And like this guy's the best  Did you hear what he said?  You lay down to the guy next to you  Did you hear what he said?  The original man!  You know we got cameras  Let's go do it  That would be really funny  Let's fucking do it  That's one that we should do  I don't care about this  It's gotta be the over the top De Niro laugh  Yeah  Their dumb prison anger  I don't give a fuck  They're just dopes  It really is stupid  Look at them  Preach!  Shut up  And the one guy will read passages  From the bible 
[02:15:00]  And the other guy will  Try to tell you what they meant  And completely twist it around  They look like clowns  Are they black wizards?  They are  They're dressed like wizards  Do they have wizardry?  They're practicing wizards  But they  Nobody takes them seriously  It's like  They're allowed to do it  But they just  They look just  Making clowns out of themselves  And the fact that they're allowed to do it though  Is one sided  The clan could do it  The clan could not stand in Times Square  And do that  No fucking way could they do that  Maybe cause the violence against them 
[02:15:30]  Would be too bad  Well how about the violence against these people  Why don't  How come we gotta look at them  Calling you a devil  Calling white people the devil  Pointing out white people  And saying how they're the devil  If you go up  I saw a video of one guy  He had a bible  White guy  Walked right up to them  And started reading scripture back to them  And telling them what it meant  And they were just yelling at him and shit  It's inciting a riot  Is what it's doing  The reason people probably don't attack them  Is A, nobody takes them seriously  The clan has a history of violence 
[02:16:00]  Oh and black men don't  Oh no black men do  But I'm saying this group  The black Israelites  Yeah  Don't have a history  The clan's history is just  To me they're fairly harmless now  They're just a bunch of racists  That's old history right  But it's like the Nazis  You can't be a part of that  And not expect  The same thing that would give people  Reason to listen to you  Is the same thing that's gonna cause people  To wanna throw bricks at you  I would like to see bricks thrown at Klansmen  More than these guys 
[02:16:30]  Cause these guys annoy me more  Cause I'm white  They just annoy me  But to me these guys  They haven't been such cowards  Where they're hiding  At least they're not hiding their faces  Well you know why  3 o'clock in the morning  Fucking burning crosses on people's lawns  But here's why  They know they can do this with impunity  No one's gonna hit them  No one's gonna fucking take any action  The cops aren't gonna stop them  Because god forbid you do anything  To the black community  That's trying to preach  They would say better themselves  By preaching hate and racism 
[02:17:00]  Is what they do out in public  Which like I said  I am all about first amendment  Right  Say whatever the fuck you want  But right down the street  In Times Square  I'd love to see a fucking gathering  Of national socialists  But I'm saying  Preaching their fucking ideology  The Klan hid their faces  Oh yeah  Because there would have been  No repercussions for them  In the 50s and Mississippi  In the 40s  They could have done whatever  They did do whatever they wanted  But there was such a cowardice to it  Because they were doing wrong shit  These guys 
[02:17:30]  I don't like these guys  I think they're laughable  They're irritating  I would love to have the balls  To stand there and laugh  Or just stand there and keep yawning  And how boring they are  You know  There's so many things  Or fucking breakdance in front of them  I wish  Breakdance  I had the balls to pop luck  In front of them  Like fucking 1985  Because that would annoy them  We should write  They're used to being yelled at  We should write something up 
[02:18:00]  And go do it  They ain't gonna touch us  I'm not worried about them touching us  No they're just clowns  Let's go have some fun  They are clowns  But they have no history  This group  I don't think that they have a history  Of actually doing shit to people  Other than being enragingly annoying  And they are enraging  I would love to just  You'd love to just  Attack them with a flamethrower  Yeah  But they're not doing anything  Other than just talking shit  Well then let  Other people do the same thing  In Times Square  Do you think they're getting a permit  Do you think they have a permit everyday  To go out there? 
[02:18:30]  They might  How do they have a permit everyday?  Because they were in front of the MTV building  A long time ago  Yeah  When I used to do stuff there  And let me tell you something  The reason that the Klan  The National Socialists wouldn't do it  Is they wouldn't have the balls  To stand out there  Without police protection everyday  Most of them wouldn't  Like it's like the fucking  Westboro Church  Like you  The Klan  Why do they need police protection?  Because they're white people  Preaching against let's say black people  And they know that black people  Would come up and clock them  In the fucking face  Absolutely  And these guys know  That scaredy shit 
[02:19:00]  Douchebag white people  Aren't gonna lay a hand on them  They know it  You are right  But again  We suck as a race  White people  White people suck  That's not true  Hold on there's a couple things going on  Because Times Square has a lot of cops  So they're protected everyday  Yeah  They're certainly protected everyday  And I want to ask Garrett really quickly  Yeah  When I walk by that  And I think when Jimmy walks by that  I see how comical that is  But it seems like it enrages you  Oh it enrages me because  Have you walked by those guys in Times Square?  It's not so much  Yeah yeah  Okay  It's not so much 
[02:19:30]  I could give a shit what they're saying  They look like clowns  I know  They look like fools  I know I think my point's being kind of missed here  Well that's why I want to ask you  I'm not talking about what they're saying  That isn't enraging me  It is infuriating what they're saying  But that isn't the gist of it  What I hate  Is the complete double standard  The fact that they can do it  And stand there and preach  Fucking hatred  Bigotry and racism  Right  Which by the way black people  Apparently can't really do  Because they don't have the power  They've tried to brainwash everyone  To think you can't be black and racist 
[02:20:00]  Right  Which is complete bullshit  But then there's the white people  That can't do it  Legally they can't  They have permits for everything  Yeah I'm sure they do  So they have permits to stand there  So if national socialists  Wanted to go out there every day  And preach anti-semitism  And racism  They would be allowed to do it  Just as readily as these people  Here's the difference  This is why  Believe me  White people 
[02:20:30]  It's not like white people  Are a race of cowards  Who have never confronted blacks  It is literally  Not in the modern age  But when you look at historically  The Klan has a history  A long history  Of violently and cowardly  Attacking civilians  The Nazis  Have a history  Of fucking barbaric abuse  These are not just opinions  These are people who are basing  Their identity  In a group with a history  And it's almost like people  Are attacking that history  It's like  These guys 
[02:21:00]  They're just fucking clowns  They have no history themselves  How about I bring up the recent history  Of the totally disproportionate number  Of violent crimes committed  By black men  How about that history  Right?  What they're talking about there though  Is a dumb religious thing  The dumb religious thing includes  White people  I know  Being the devil  I know  And them preaching  How white people  Should be wiped  From the face of the earth 
[02:21:30]  And how they will  Eventually  How they come from  Queens  And kings  And princes  And flying pyramids  And all that happy horse shit  And no one can confront them on it  You can't fucking smack them in the face  You can't get so outraged  That you would commit violence against them  Because white people don't do that  For the most part  In these situations  But guaranteed  You get somebody up there  Preaching racism against blacks  They'd get either shot  Or a punch in the fucking face  Let me go to a cop  That worked that beat  In Times Square 
[02:22:00]  I'm a cop you idiot  Eric  Eric can give us a little more info on this  Eric in Staten Island  Go ahead  Good morning gentlemen  Hey man  I just want to let Anthony know  I've worked there a few times with them  They do get the sound permits  For that speaker  But on the other point  Of the same way  The white guy doesn't go up to him  I've had to  I haven't physically locked someone up  But you get the tourists from middle America  Who do actually go up and hit these guys  And we have to lock them up  And vice versa  When they get into it  And we have to lock them up too  That's nice  Yeah they do roll with the people  So they're getting arrested  Yeah exactly 
[02:22:30]  It's the tourists who go after them though  It's not so much New York  Yeah yeah  I can see some guy from the Midwest  Like hey what the hell you talking about  Bulla  Because I think New Yorkers were  I hate to say this  But we're immune to a lot of this shit  Yeah  You see this crap when you're walking around  And it really is comical  On the surface  These guys are no  These guys are no threat  Other than they're annoying  That's all they really are  And I know what you mean about a history of  They are a threat  They are inciting violence against white people  That is dangerous 
[02:23:00]  It's the same thing  You want to look back at any movement  The Klan  You want to look back at National Socialism  It's  And I'm not saying that's where this is headed  Right  But it did start  With guys just bullshitting on the street  Like that  People do take this shit to heart  And think if Whitey's the devil  I could perpetrate crimes against them  They're inciting  You're inciting right now  People are very upset  Yeah fuck them  Hold on  Chris I'll log out really fast  Exactly  Anthony you are inciting 
[02:23:30]  Listen  You're real close to Times Square  Go down there and punch the guy in the face yourself  If they're calling us a bunch of pussies  No I  Because we're pussies  Because I first of all  Don't want to get jumped in on by 20 guys  Because you'll never see a fair fight  I'll get sucker punched on the side of the fucking head  And then kicked and stomped in the skull  Because that's common practice with fighting  And I'm not going to do that  Because you know what  Silly me  Don't want to get locked up  Don't want to go to jail  No you're right  That's exactly it  We're not a bunch of pussies 
[02:24:00]  We have too much to lose  I said we're pussies  Not for punching them in the face my friend  We're pussies  For not  For not  Going on the other side of the street  And preaching hatred  Against these people  We  Does that make you better  To lower yourself  Do they have standards?  Eh  It just makes it  It exposes the double standard  The fact that they would be standing out there  Long after you're  Chased away by the cops  For some rule  That the mayor would come up with  For inciting a riot 
[02:24:30]  And speaking hate speech  Hate speech  Hate speech  Nobody takes them seriously  That's hate speech  Like all of their anger  And their rage  It is of no value  They're standing there  On crates  Err!  Pre!  Err!  Really getting nothing done  Well then  Racists against black people  Should be able to  Spew  The same  Hate  And ugliness  And nastiness  Okay  On the other side of the street  Where are all of those brave  National socialists 
[02:25:00]  And brave klansmen  Not even in their uniforms  Where are all these brave white people  To just go as citizens  And stand there?  Guaranteed they would have such a problem  Getting a permit  And even being able to stand there  No, no, no, no permit  Why not as a bunch of citizens  Where are all those brave souls?  Because you'd be arrested  Stand there for them and listen  And then yell back  You'd be arrested  You could stand there and yell back  Oh, you could yell back at them  Sure  But by the way, I've seen that  Yeah  I've seen it  But I'm talking about an organized group  That every day 
[02:25:30]  Goes into Times Square  And preaches their hate  And their want of violence  Against a certain group of people  Where is that?  We should get one of these guys on the air  Oh God  Would you not think that  That is just as ugly  As what these guys are doing?  Of course it is  Yes, that's what I'm saying  I'm not rah-rah-ing for the other side  Dude, you're missing my point  I'm saying that there's no balance there  Because the law will not allow a balance there  There's no balance there  This is also the  These guys are not a reflection on white weakness  Them existing and doing that 
[02:26:00]  Is not a direct reflection of white people being cowards or afraid of them  Individually, yeah  It's 15 black guys on the street  You don't want to  But if you also notice these brave souls  They're not standing in Bensonhurst  They know where they are too  These guys are no different than any other group  They're not dummy  They also know there's police  Yeah, there's police protection around them  There is  Do you think they would stand there comfortably in Bensonhurst?  Of course they would  There'd be fucking 200 people throwing rocks at them  Hey, we got BJ from Memphis  He wants to ask a question 
[02:26:30]  He's a black guy  Which is important for the discussion  What's up, BJ?  What's up, fellas?  Anthony, I would just like to know where you get your fear of black people from  I have no fear of black people, sir  I have no fear of black people  Aren't you Sicilian?  He said he's not afraid of black people  But I think you're right  Yeah, I'm Sicilian  You know, the Moors  They did a lot of fucking  My great-great-great-great-grandmother  I have no fear 
[02:27:00]  No fear at all  I walked out of the mall the other day with my fucking MacBook in my hand  Being followed by five young African-American gentlemen into a dark-lipped parking garage  As they were eyeballing the shit out of me, by the way  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah  And no problem?  You didn't tell us this  Nary a fucking problem  I got right in my Escalade  Gave them a look  They looked back at me  Everything was fine 
[02:27:30]  Fine and dandy  Did you?  I didn't do anything  I just walked  I'm just saying  I just walked  I just walked  People have a sixth sense about those things, I think  I have no problems  This was a  I love black people  This was a real thing that went on with you  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Walking out  Getting the eyeball  Getting the  The fucking eyeball  I hate that fucking eye 
[02:28:00]  Don't fucking look at me like that  I'm not a mark  I'm not a victim  That's all  That's all  That's all I'm saying  Hey, things have happened  You ever see that guy lose his fingers?  Has he got that bag ripped out of his fucking hand at the mall?  Holy shit  You know how hard it is to get my eyes to get this big?  I've got tiny little squinty eyes, man  But they're as big as that guy in the fucking rowboat from Caddyshack right now  Damn 
[02:28:30]  Alright  My truck was very close to where I left  I'm just reading between the lines  No, let me just say my truck was  You didn't say anything or  No, no, I'm not saying  And I'm not saying anything  Sure  My truck was very close to the door  So when I walked out  I didn't have to walk very far to get to my truck  I honestly think  And this is from someone whose head is on a swivel  Not a paranoid person  Somebody who would back away from a gathering or a situation I see 
[02:29:00]  Rather than let guilt put me in a dangerous situation  Right  Which people have been guilty of in the past  But I think if my car wasn't that close and I wasn't getting into it  There might have been some type of situation  Maybe, sure  Because they were absolutely looking  I'm walking out with what amounts to a $2,500 computer in my hand  No bag, you could see it  It's just a little apple carrying case  So I think if I didn't because when I got into my truck 
[02:29:30]  I was being fucking eyeballed like a motherfucker  They were just following you out?  Followed me out  And I got into my truck  They were backed off me a little bit  And I think they thought I was going to continue walking  Further down the parking lot  Into the garage  Into the dark parking garage  And I got right into my vehicle  And they kind of stopped and just looked at me  Yeah, you're probably right  I was like  This isn't paranoia  Nope  And then I backed out  And I could have taken one exit one way 
[02:30:00]  But I came back around  Just so I could drive right past them  And give them a little smile on the way out  That's good  You made it worse for the next white guy  So I jumped back  And gave them a little smile on the way out  Yeah, I probably did  But fuck that  We should get one of these guys  I would love to interview one of these fucking black Israelites  Why not?  If they would come in the studio  We should do what Kevin Smith does  And embrace these people  Yeah, right?  Isn't he having the Westboro people on stage  At one of his premieres?  Is he really?  Is he doing that?  That's what I'm hearing  Smart move  We should get him on the phone maybe 
[02:30:30]  To talk about that for a couple of minutes  Dude, these guys are fucking  Are hateable guys  Making pornography featuring X-Men  Right, and I don't want to watch that before I eat lasagna  That's tough  Like some guy  We should make fun of the guy  Yeah, we should get some clips of that maybe  Oh, we really should  Because they're just yelling  It's almost like a bunch of children  Who have a little place in the backyard  Where they can yell and make noise  And mom and dad let them 
[02:31:00]  Go ahead, yell all your dirty words  We're going to the clubhouse  That's what that is  Clubhouse  That's why  On a whole  On a giant level  They're not dangerous  Or a threat to anything  Yeah, let's get them on the phone  We should do that  Because we talk about this a lot  I'd rather have one of the guys in studio  We bring this up a lot  So we should maybe talk to them  Or a couple guys in here  I'd love to have a couple in there  Yeah, no problem  Hey, by the way  You got the iPad too?  What's the difference?  I think I'm holding out  What's the difference?  Because you went and got that  As well as the computer, right? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, it's got a camera  Processors are faster  FaceTime  Yeah, you got FaceTime on there  That FaceTime is pretty amazing  Oh yeah  Comes with iMovie  So you could edit some shit  Yeah  Shit like that  I want to get it  It's smaller, it's lighter  Looks cool  Is the screen smaller?  No  No  No, it's uh  It's just new  So it's cool  It smells good  I'm gonna take it out of the package  I love that smell  I want to go to the Apple store today  But I don't know if I know anybody 
[02:32:00]  Oh  I know people  Mmm  Oh  I knew somebody in the Apple store  I know but I know  What are you doing?  But I was saying I just called them  And that's when I'm getting that message  Oh really?  The number you dialed is no good  So you probably changed it  And I want a kid to be calling  The key  He knew the key  It would be on the phone soon  I don't  I don't understand that I  I saw people on  A line that was three to four hours long  Wow  To get the iPad too  Man, I saw that video you posted  It was uh 
[02:32:30]  The Apple store in New York City  And it went completely around  An entire city block and further  It was  It made uh  Cause a lot of people were asking  It made an uh  An S  An S shape from the door  Yeah  If that makes sense  S shape around the one block  Was half the S  And then looped back around  So it was three quarters of one block  Oh  And then made another  The top part of the S  Wait, wait, wait  Where would it be about  Uh  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Or was it a flying W?  I guess it would be a backwards S 
[02:33:00]  They did it smart though by the way  The way they had  The Apple is smart  The way they had the uh  So  People out there  Keeping the lines split  It was almost two complete blocks  Is what I'm getting at  Massive  Yeah, I filmed the video  And uh  And you know what?  I saw that line all day  By the time I finally said  I gotta do something with this  The line was actually shorter  For the people that did check out that video  If you could believe that  Really?  The line was actually shorter  Than what I showed in that video  And I had to run  Just to get to the end of the line  It took four minutes  It's a four minute video 
[02:33:30]  Of going from  The front of the line  To the back of the line  Four minutes on video  Is an eternity  Yeah, I liked when it's like  Oh, so this is the end of the line  I get in here  It's like  And everybody panics  No!  No further!  You go!  But how  How bad do you need it on the first day?  I don't understand that  Is that just a tech thing?  Tech heads  Yeah, yeah  You wanna  It's like anything else  Where people wait on line  Now, I would understand  I would never wait on line  I should've interviewed  Some of those people  Because I'm wondering 
[02:34:00]  If they waited on line  To get the iPad 2  To turn around  And make a profit off it  Mmm  A few people  But most people  Just needed it that day  Yeah, I think people just like  Why?  Because it's out there  And you wanna be the person  That's playing around with it  But why?  I don't know necessarily either  But I would  I'm willing  I want them the first day badly  I'm just not willing to do that  Right  But I understand the want of it  Because I want it as bad as they do  They're just more willing to do something  I'm not  But there was a  There was a weird excitement in the air  So maybe people get caught up in that 
[02:34:30]  Like they wanna be part of something  Yeah  It wasn't like the Apple employees  Were like rah-rah-ing everybody  They did the same thing at the mall I was at  You see a little bit of that in my video  But in general they're rah-rah-ing  And there's cheers going on  Ooh, yeah  They're high-fiving everybody that's coming in  Yeah, I don't know  It's like what is this?  Cult  Fucking cult is what it is  Apple has an amazing  There's something about the smell of those fucking stores  I know  And the packages  I don't know what they do  Great  There's fucking heroin in the fucking vents at Apple  Right 
[02:35:00]  I don't know what gets you so hooked  I don't get it  But you have to have the new thing  Dude, I'm a fucking  I'm an Apple jizz bag fanboy  I hate myself  Me too  I definitely love a lot of their stuff  I blew off the iPhone when Atrix  I'm digging my Atrix, by the way  But I love the Apple stuff  Isolate that  Because this will eventually be replayed  When you say I'm digging my Atrix  Eventually it's gonna be iPhone  We'll see  I think everyone's gonna go in that direction  I was happy to, you know, go Atrix  Is it all touch?  Yeah, yeah  It's all glass?  I definitely like it so far 
[02:35:30]  But I don't understand why you would wait on line that long for anything  I'm trying to think what I would wait on line that long for  Nice piece of pussy  Yeah  Despicable  Despicable  Well, the black lady's like  What is everyone waiting for?  And I go  Well, it's free blowjobs for the guys  She was outraged  Outraged  She was outraged  She wanted to be there giving them  She was so outraged  I was running  And I don't think it  The video picked it up  But she was out  She was like  She was mad that I said that to her  She was really pissed 
[02:36:00]  And I actually had to say  Oh, I'm sorry about that  But I couldn't help it  I'm sorry that  You're the victim here today  But  That video's up on the Facebook page  Opie and Anthony  If you want to check it out for yourself  Heather Hite twittered  She goes  You fuckers  That's my black Israelites  Bit idea  You want to bring snacks in a chair  And clap and laugh  Oh, that's good  Yeah, you just sit down  With snacks  And you watch them  Like a bad comedy movie  Like a movie  Yeah  Woohoo!  Cheer them on  But to Heather and the rest of the people  That haven't  It's just an idea until you do it 
[02:36:30]  So go and do it  If it comes out well  I'll retweet that shit for you Heather  Oh, 3D glasses?  Yeah, that'd be funny  3D glasses  That'd be  Wow, it looks like they're right here  Yeah  It looks like the re-release of  Oh, do I want to name a movie?  Yeah  Those guys suck  Hey, did we  Speaking of videos  Did we post Anthony's sitcom video?  Oh, yeah  Yeah, it's up on our Facebook page  It's our Facebook page  We can do whatever the fuck we want, man  Yes 
[02:37:00]  This is a bit...  Did you see it?  I certainly did not, Gregory!  Oh, boy  My sitcom opening  Can I...  It's a tribute to the 80's sitcom  Can I...  Ah  I'll ask you one thing  Okay  Did not see that  And it's not the other thing that people are talking about  Alright  Let's see  Can I mention this?  Uh...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  It bothered me so much  I know  That was my mistake  When you go to the Facebook page  And hopefully you see my iPad video  But also see Live from the Compound sitcom opening  Is up there  That aunt there with his girl 
[02:37:30]  It's a...  It's a great take on sitcoms  And how they opened up in what the 80's  Play a little music  Oh, who did the song?  I don't know  I found it  Oh, you just found it?  Yeah, it's...  See, it's more of a visual  Yeah  But, like, if anybody could identify them  It's a sitcom opening where...  Where the characters don't realize they're being filmed  So they turn toward the camera  Yeah  And smile all happy and stuff  And look what book she's got  Oh, I Hate Your Guts  Yes, I Hate Your Guts book 
[02:38:00]  You have to replace that with boats down there  And then this entry  Anthony comes home with his laundry bag  Hey, hi  It's always the nodding head  Yeah  And there's a laundry bag full of fucking white supremacist literature  Hey, look, there's a mismatched sock  One's black, one's white  Yeah, she throws the black one out  Because she's in your house  And then it starts getting a little weird  She's suffocating me  I want to go back  I'm amazed you guys knew where the laundry room was  Yeah  Did you have to ask someone where it was?  Yes 
[02:38:30]  But for this opening  How come all the white sheets don't have eye holes in them?  Yeah  And now it's getting more and more violent  Anthony punched her in the face  I felt her in the face  Knocked her out  But then she gets you back  You're on the couch with the computer  She gets me with the shovel  Gets you with the shovel  That's great  The shovel  And then, well  Well, she pays  And then Ant's hacking her apart in the tub  But there's a film flop  Yup  The fake blood is on the side of the tub 
[02:39:00]  Right, in a bowl  You forgot to move that  Oh, that's hilarious  Oh, you boo  Boo  I'm like, Ed, it's a perfect video  But you fucking left the bowl of fake blood  There's a bowl of blood there  On the side of the tub  You know what?  Everything was covered in it so much  That I didn't even notice until it was done  And I was like, oh shit  Yeah  Can't do that over again  No, you should though  That's the way you should do it  Just leave the fake blood right out there  I know  It kind of ruins the whole illusion  I told Anna  It looks like it could be a candle 
[02:39:30]  No, I said  It's the bowl that I was using  To cut her heart out  And put her heart in there  Alright, so there you go  It's still there  It still works  Ain't working?  I don't know, I like when I see a plane  In the green screen  I like when they pan back  And I can just see the crew around  Yeah  I pointed that out  Cause I'm a  I'm a film flub douchebag  Douchebag  That's on my  O-P-A-N-T-X-M  YouTube  It's also on  I think  It is on Funny or Die  Also 
[02:40:00]  It's on Facebook though  That's the easiest place  Facebook  We linked everything through our Facebook page  Yeah, yeah  Anthony, so  I mean that  Yeah, very good  That's very good  Yeah, I like doing little videos like that  A lot of fun  Alright  Something good to do on a  On a little Saturday afternoon  We'll uh  We'll break here  And  We have John Jones calling again  I was hoping to get him in studio  But he's uh  He's fighting uh  For the uh  Light Heavyweight Championship  And there's a Strikeforce thing happening  We'll talk about it after the break  Yes  And he fights on Saturday 
[02:40:30]  I don't think  No, I can't  Why?  Why?  Well actually  No, I can actually  I'm going to that  Yeah  Absolutely  No, cause I was thinking of going to Boston with you  Boston  You got a Boston gig this weekend, right?  Yes, I do  And I'm going  I'm doing the Wilbur Theatre 2 shows  And then I come back lately that night  And go to UFC the next night  In Prudential Center in Jersey  Yeah, my thing was to go to Boston with you  And then uh  Cause you creeps like drive home in the middle of the night  And then I would stay the night  Yeah, you creeps  They're creeps  Oh, I know  They go to these places that could be cool  They flee the town 
[02:41:00]  And then they're done with the gig at 2 in the morning or whatever  And then they drive home  Like why not fucking have a nice hotel room  Sleep in  Maybe check out the city a little bit  Then go home  Cause I honestly  These creeps leave in the middle of the night always  I travel so much that the travel becomes  It's a big part  It's almost like I've learned  I've sat in so much traffic  I'm like why would I spend hours doing this  Right  When I could be home and just sleep  So I blew off the idea of going to Boston with you  Cause like I said  You guys will leave  Oh yeah, we'll leave  I'll just be there 
[02:41:30]  2 in the morning  Wondering what to do  So now I'm going to go to UFC on Saturday  Where is it?  It's Prudential Center in Jersey  It's Jon Jones against Shogun  Nice  And Uriah  Faber's fighting  Oh, Faber's fighting again  Yeah, he's a  Oh, nice  Really?  Alright, well we're going to have him on the phone  Not Faber  Jon Jones on, right?  Yeah, he's a black fighter  He's the longest reach in the UFC  He's very fucking good, man  I don't know half these guys  Nah  Just when I think I know a lot of them  I realize I barely know any of these guys  Me and Bobby got a photo with him 
[02:42:00]  We were at UFC  But I didn't know who he was at the time  Bob's like this guy's fucking  Bob knows a lot about UFC  He's like this guy's going to be great  Very great  And Rashad Evans got hurt  So now this guy's taking his place in a fight  Alright, cool  You uh  By the way  Hold on  Wow  Hold on 2 seconds  Oh no  Don't worry  Is this good news for me?  It's a  No, no, of course it's not  Why not?  I want good news  I want the iPad 2  Exactly  That's this  I'll pay for it  Speaker  I'm gonna play this 
[02:42:30]  Hold on  You're sitting in traffic you dumb fucking  Bob  Hey  Anthony  Kelly, you got a fucking iPad?  God damn it  My fucking connection failed  Miserably  I'm so fucking annoyed right now  Just failed  Oh God  Fucking  I love you but I despise you right now  That you have it in your fucking hand  Just walked in 
[02:43:00]  God damn it  His business sucks  His business sucks  And you know him  He is one of those guys that needs this shit when it comes out  He was losing his mind  He needs it  And all we were doing  Yeah  Was texting him pictures  Of all of us  Because we all went back to my house  After our iPad shopping spree that we did  And we were just texting Bobby pictures of us with our iPads  That's hilarious  And he was getting really mad  I should have fucking  Please if anybody has a connection in New York  There's two stores 
[02:43:30]  67th and  Just  To burn Bob Kelly  Yes  I have an iPad  Two  And I will just take pictures of it  And I fucking  I want to do nothing but annoy that  Fucking idiot  I got a guy  At ours  I got the magic card right here  Oh you do  I had one  But his number is no good anymore  I got a guy  His card says  Expert  Expert  That's all it says  At what?  I got a guy  He's an apple expert  It just says expert  Maybe he sells fruit or something 
[02:44:00]  Apples  Expert  We go after the show  Let's go talk to my guy  Yeah I need to go  After the show  I didn't need an iPad 2 that badly  So I didn't go with my guy  I really do want one  I like this one  It's only two months old  I'm good for now  I don't need one either  I'm good for now  And I had to buy a new fucking MacBook too  Why?  Because my other one is two months old  And they came out with the quad processor  And the fucking Thunderbolt interface  You bought one two months later?  Yeah  Besides  Where does all the old stuff go? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah  Well I'm using both of them now  I render on one  And then I can work on the other  While it's the other projects rendering  Well what did you do with the one  Like the one obviously we know  What kind of porn is on that one  Right  After you wipe it clean  Shit  I use both of them  Like a fucking  Like a Emerson Lake and Palmer  Fucking  I'm working two keyboards and shit  It's good  You could fucking  That's cool  You could get some shit done  Alright why don't we break  Oh by the way those blue things are for fishing 
[02:45:00]  Someone told me  What?  Because it's a fishing city there  A fishing town  I'm going to do a lot of fishing  That's a lot of fucking fish then  Yes  Because my gad  I forgot  Someone told me what it was  And now I'm way past  What's happening to this guy?  I don't know  What's happening to that gentleman?  I think he got shot or something  He's fallen down a hill  Where he got pushed out  Is this Iran?  Or who knows?  Everyone's not even paying attention to the outrage  That Gaddafi is like kind of winning  How did he figure that shit out?  He's fucking 
[02:45:30]  I thought he was dead in the water  They said  And this is classic  They said  That the rebels  Just don't know what the fuck they're doing  And if they just dig trenches  And get in holes  When bombs fall  That they'd be much better off  But they're so unorganized  That they don't even know to dig a hole  And get in the fucking thing  When planes and artillery are hitting you  I'm amazed he's surviving that  I think he's going to pull this one off  Just to tell you the truth  Tell you the truth  Yeah  They're kind of crushing the rebellion  The rebellion 
[02:46:00]  Rebellion  Tips on how to talk to your kids about the tsunami  The news is just ridiculous  But I want to know how to talk about my kids  There's no way  I mean it's universal  It's everywhere  As we're speaking  Dick Dick  When I say censor  I'm saying  Look at the information first  As far as the websites that you choose  To share with your kids  Because you want to use that information  That's much more age appropriate  Instead of just putting in a tsunami  And then seeing whatever comes up  And sharing with them  You lie to your kids  That's what it's saying  So preview it first 
[02:46:30]  And then share the information  Atomic catastrophe coming kids  Run for your lives  I'll tell you how to talk to them  Oh no  Yeah you give them another example  Of a tsunami with fluid coming out  Instead of just the emotion of it only  That's terrible  Because they are going to be scared  There's no way to avoid that  But you can help to manage some of that fear  I think a lot of these kids  They get so far away  Yeah  I really have to say  It is  You know I was watching with my son  Granted he's 16 years old  No one gives a fuck  Oh  He's embarrassed right now  Maybe it's different 
[02:47:00]  I don't know  They don't feel concerned about it  They don't feel concerned about it  I think some adults are more concerned  But you know what  They should be a bit more concerned about it  Because they do have  Japanese American friends  Let me just write this word down for you  They do have you know  Children who you know  Whose parents perhaps  Well that part I can understand  But they don't feel any concern for themselves  Well here's what's going to happen  When they go to school  Don't touch me  This sort of thing is going to start being talked about  So the teachers are going to talk about  How many people know what a tsunami  Where did the word tsunami come from? 
[02:47:30]  It's a Japanese word  You know that means harbor  Nami did something bad  And was taken to court  And litigated against  No no no  With suicide Nami  Oh  This is something that is happening in the world  Oh Chip  Yes it's far away  Shut up  Kids know way more than parents in general  Yeah don't worry about it  This black nerd is really annoying me  I don't like black nerds  That should be a white person thing  Black nerds just look unnatural  They're like fucking white break dancers  Yeah  Or white rappers  They're creepy  It looks silly  Just think Urkel right?  It's creepy 
[02:48:00]  You always think Urkel  Urkel  He kinda has an Urkel look to him  That is an Urkel  White newscasters are looking at him like  Shut up you fag  Nah the guy on the left is a complete nerd asshole  A nerd  I study these fucking people  And that one I saw walking into a yoga fucking studio  Yeah  All the weekend  I was over in Japan when the quake hit by the way  Yeah what happened there?  What?  It's a tsunami  I was saving people  They were like Chip help us out  Yeah  Wow  Really?  How many people did you save?  75  Something 
[02:48:30]  There was stuff blowing back  I'm like where are all these blue things  I was throwing them  How'd you stay away from the water?  I was riding the waves and stuff  I was on top of a car  Just surfing and grabbing people out of trees  Helping them  Surfing?  On top of the car  Cause a lot of stuff  But a lot of the debris  Could probably  Would have hurt you  Nah but it sounds like  Pfff whatever  Saving people  Lying chip is the word  I was just saying  They were helping them out  I'll help you but give me some money  Oh you charge them to help you?  Yeah  Or for you to help them?  Yeah  400,000 dollars 
[02:49:00]  These numbers are ridiculous  I wanna  I actually wanna talk to Ted today  Desperately  Because I remember when Heath Ledger died  Someone's reminding me  And I appreciate that  Neon taster  Israel  Israel checking in  He said that Ted talked to the children  About how to handle the Heath Ledger situation  So I'm just wondering maybe after the break  If Ted's around today  He could help us out  And how he discussed the tsunami in Japan  To our children  And also I wanna find out  If he set up some kind of emporium 
[02:49:30]  To make a little money off the  The disaster over there in Japan  I know I'm just  I'm just saying  I'd like to find those  I'd like to find those things out as well  Because I have no idea  If Ted's been thinking of that stuff  Well that's why I figured  Maybe in an eight minute break  That maybe  Maybe  Yes Ted may have an idea  Ted might have something  He might not  He may  I wouldn't hold our breath for Ted's  I'm not  I'm not  Yeah it's a little too  A little too soon  Oh no no no  For Ted's emporium 
[02:50:00]  Oh not at all  Ted would fire out some ideas  If he had them  Sure he would  The fuck was your tweet on the tsunami  Were you Galash's guy?  Oh yeah  Galash's  You were Galash's guy right  I just said  It was fucking hilarious  Something about  Galash's  He was Galash's guy  Is that word?  I just I don't remember  So he had bad news  He was talking about the tsunami man  Yeah I tied it in with  Galash's  Galash's  Galash's is a funny word  It certainly is  I just don't remember what I  Yeah whatever  I said 
[02:50:30]  I like to read my own  I think it's painfully obvious  We need a break  I'm tired  Where's Z-Rock today?  Yeah where is that  Did he make it into work?  Yeah Eric's cutting up some  Some stuff to play a tackle  Oh okay  Cutting up some fucking pizza  Cutting up a rug  He's dancing in a room by himself  Cutting up a rug  Yeah and then the music from fucking  Escape from New York  Escape from New York  I want to see Eric dancing to fucking Ernest Borden  Escape from New York  Can we do that for our amusement?  I really want to see him dancing on a small throw rug 
[02:51:00]  Oh god  After the break  Only bring this up  Cause way too many people tweet about this one as well  Cause a lot of times we're like eh  But this one  I don't know  SNL  Did they rip us off?  I am going with a yes on this one  You are  And I'm one of the most  I'm always like ah  This shit is funny  Think about things  And one guy has one bit  One guy's got another  It doesn't necessarily mean it  This one is so out there 
[02:51:30]  And just came out of nowhere  I feel like we're on the radar  As far as SNL goes  Certainly Jimmy Fallon  Cause Jimmy is  You know he's a friend of the show  I'm not saying he's ever ripped us off by the way  Funny or Die  Funny or Die  I feel like we're on the radar  Family Guy  Maybe South Park  Yeah  And sometimes it's very suspicious  When you see some of this stuff in other places  But this SNL thing  Is pretty much our Billy the Bassman bit  It was Billy the Bassman bit  It was definitely Billy the Bassman 
[02:52:00]  Making fun of Larry the Cable Guy  And there really wasn't any  Nothing happened recently that would like spark that  No this thing  Except for the bit  This thing came out of nowhere  Yeah  During SNL over the weekend  I'm not going to say a rip off  I'll say you know an homage  It was an idea  All we're saying is that  Maybe someone that is a writer  Or works for one of the writers at SNL  Just happens to listen to our show  And might have brought an idea to them  Because it's like what?  What?  Yeah you could listen to this show  And then go like  Oh that would make a good bit 
[02:52:30]  Right  The bit was called King of um  The original Kings of Catchphrase Comedy  Comedy  And it's uh  And we only did this a week ago  It's a bunch of comics  Two weeks ago  They have lame  Yeah turn it up  Let's give it a listen  Let's do it now  Fuck it  Boom boom boom  This is The Network  Oh Christ  How long is this commercial?  I hate the ones that are really long  Yeah  Five second ones  Fine  I can handle 15 even  15 I'm fine with 
[02:53:00]  Just stop right there  The 30's are really starting to get  They're getting a lot of 30's in there now  Makes you itchy right?  Oh boy  There's a lot of videos  I decide not to check out  You bail out  Cause the commercial hits me  I'm like you know what?  It wasn't that important to me  Sorry you just lost me  You bail out  Work  Rethink possible  I ain't giving you fucking  Alright here we go  You ready to laugh?  It's the original Kings of Catchphrase comedy tour 
[02:53:30]  The four kings of Catchphrase are back  And they're going absolutely  Frazy with David Beef Jelly Winfield  So my buddy Jimmy says  Hey man  You wanna go to the waffle house?  And I look at him and was like  Man I ain't going to the house made from no waffles  Beef Jelly  Croatian import  Goran Funky Boy Bogdan  I go to your Sonic restaurant  I order a plate of Dobrzejki  They tell me the washroom is that way  Ooh  Funky boy 
[02:54:00]  Slappy Pappy  Oh man  If a Dracula is chasing you  Turn around and trip the mix  Slappy Pappy wait wait  And Pete Airhorn Schultz  The kings are back  I heard Zach was hilarious on SNL  But I  Well that was Zach  I feel like he decided he didn't want to write anything for this bit 
[02:54:30]  He said I'll just fucking go out there with an air horn  I'm just gonna be the air horn guy  Yeah  Yeah  What do you think Jimmy? That's part of it  We'll play the rest of it in a second here  I mean obviously  It's extraordinarily close and the timing of it is  Yes  The only thing we have is the timing of it  Yeah  Because it came out of nowhere literally two weeks after we pretty much did this bit with Bob Kelly  Bob Kelly did a brilliant Billy the Bassman with his catchphrase  Where are we going?  Yeah  Where are we going?  It was all about the catchphrase  It wasn't even about the material  No  And that's exactly what they're doing here is just the catchphrase that doesn't even fit 
[02:55:00]  Right  It has no reason to be in there  This was a year later whatever  Whatever  It's an obvious one that certainly if you're into writing comedy you would go with  Or if there was a big tour going on where those guys were touring  Right  No this is a filler bit for SNL  Yeah  Because SNL tries to go with what's happening in the world  This has nothing to do with anything current really  It's just something that has been going on in comedy for a while  Well there is that  I know the one writer that does listen to the show  B.C. Dudley 
[02:55:30]  Is a writer for SNL who likes the show  You see us all get our hopes up like really someone from SNL  All you got to do is listen to the names he uses  I know I know  Let's continue with the bit  Because then it gets really obvious with other comedians they pop in  You're dusting off all your old favorite bits  Like Eatin' Dookie  You ever come home and catch your wife Eatin' Dookie  Talkin' about  What put this Dookie in my hand  You did you nasty ass bitch  B.C.  Kicked in the Johnson 
[02:56:00]  I tell you I've no luck with American women  I offer them a Grisetti  They kick me straight in my Johnson  Ooh  Funky boy  McDonalds breakfast  I can't get an Eggie McMuffin because it's ten thirty five  Flappy boppy wait wait  Wait, wait.  And New York versus L.A.  Phrase the Lord.  The kings are back, and this time they brought friends.  Barry the Plumbing Gentleman.  Not in my bake shop. 
[02:56:30]  Mike, insert joke here, Henry.  Idaho, insert joke here.  Chip, I'm single, Fenny.  You know what?  Yeah, I'm single.  Boston Powers.  Do I make you horny, baby?  Dr. Velociraptor.  Addie Newsflash, sweetie.  Newsflash, I'm crazy.  White Bernie Mac.  And of course, Fur Code Rhonda. 
[02:57:00]  Of course I can afford gas.  I'm Fur Code Rhonda.  And the audience yells.  Hello there, catchphrases.  Slap it.  Slap it.  Wham.  Wham.  The original kings of catchphrase tour.  Phrase the roof.  Wow.  Coming soon to bootleg DVD.  The problem, obviously. 
[02:57:30]  I mean, the timing.  I mean, we literally did that.  Yeah.  Just a little while ago.  You know what's sad about comedy and probably...  Well, let's get Jimmy's take on this.  They can now take those characters on the road and sell out everywhere.  I'm serious.  There's enough idiots.  That's how that shit is.  There's enough idiots that actually would go, oh, fuck yeah.  Let's see the SNL catchphrase comedians.  I will say, if I ever see a guy close to Chip or Ted or Uncle Paul on there, I am going  to go fucking bananas. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The original characters, man.  But the one, that foreign comic, if he, whoever played that guy, if he hit the road, he would  sell out now.  Yeah.  People would see that and actually enjoy it.  So you're saying it's too close, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm saying definitely.  That is...  Because you're a good one with this stuff because you really like...  Yeah.  I really kind of...  I give the benefit of the doubt all the time.  Right.  But not on this one.  Not on this one.  And officially saying not on this one. 
[02:58:30]  That's why you're known as the BOTD kid.  B-O-T-D kid is calling.  Do we have Billy the Bassman for break?  Why am I totally wrong on that?  I'm sorry, but that wasn't a ripoff.  Anthony is totally wrong on this one.  Really?  Really?  Why would I be totally wrong on this one?  It's very similar to Billy the Bassman and Where Are We Going?  Any answer there?  No?  No?  Because it's not even remotely close, dude. 
[02:59:00]  Well, I'll...  He just wrote because it's not even remotely close, dude.  All right.  That's what you think, and that's fine.  It's the same bit.  But see, when you get one person tweeting saying, I think they ripped you off, and then  you don't see any others, you're like, nah, that guy just did not see it.  But I'm telling you, a lot of people tweet about this one.  A lot.  The whole gist of our bit is the fact that he has a catchphrase...  And that's why...  That doesn't make any sense in any context with his material, and then he blurts it out 
[02:59:30]  at the end of the joke.  Right.  And that was the exact same thing they were doing.  Right.  And it started with just a goof on fucking Larry the Cable Guy.  Get her done.  So we said, look, man, you know, if you're a comedian, if you just get a catchphrase,  you'll do much better, because Larry the Cable Guy was a regular comedian before he came  up with the character and the catchphrase, and then that's what led to Billy the Bassman  and where are we going, and now SNL is doing catchphrase comedy.  It's the same fucking thing, asshole.  Well, as long as I don't take my stupid catchphrase, that's all, I'll go nuts. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Don't say it then, Jimmy.  Don't do it.  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  Don't say your catchphrase.  Cut the mustard.  Love that one.  But how would you use that?  Couldn't cut the mustard!  You have to go ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  My girlfriend got so mad at me one time, people were arguing, and I kept saying,  somebody couldn't cut the mustard.  And I didn't realize what an old man expression that was.  Oh, it really is.  But she told me after, and she wanted to choke me. 
[03:00:30]  You didn't use it as a goof?  No!  I was angry.  Somebody couldn't cut the mustard.  I'm an older gentleman.  You used it angrily.  As it's supposed to be used.  Oh, yeah.  Cut the mustard, cunt.  Why, you?  I get people mad at me on Twitter because I'm using old man phrases as a goof.  But they think, oh, what an old man that you're using that.  I'm like, no, you idiot.  That's the goof.  Only an old guy would say broad.  I was fucking goofing, you idiot. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, to bring up...  Oh, geez, that was a nice one.  And I called Kim Kardashian a dodo bird.  They're like, that's an old phrase.  I'm like, yeah, that's why I'm using it.  You dodo bird.  No one wants to be called a dodo bird.  I don't like that type of language.  It's hurtful.  One more thing about the little...  Dismal thing?  No, the 86.  Oh, the 86.  Somebody actually wrote, dude, funny, but you got a little carried away with the transitions.  It's like, that's the bit. 
[03:01:30]  Do you get the point?  The point is that those old shows had the horrid, bad transitions.  Like, some people just, they're retarded.  You don't think you were saying that, like, to be obvious, like a goof?  No, it wasn't.  Like, you could tell when somebody got the joke.  But that one was like, really?  Really?  You think that I got a little crazy on the transitions?  Oh, God.  I have to think.  Oh, joke.  Yeah, they need...  Twitter's got to hire Twitter police that just yanks accounts for stupidity. 
[03:02:00]  Good luck.  No, I know.  They'd be out there yanking and yanking.  Jay Moore got all fucking pissed off.  Jay Moore's.  He got in a tizzy.  Why?  I had a private conversation with Jay Moore about it.  I don't know if he wants to...  Jay Moore's.  He made a lot of sense.  Jay Moore's made a lot of sense.  Twitter police.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da.  He made a lot of sense.  He's saying he's done with Twitter.  Yeah.  What happened?  Yeah, let him...  Okay, they censured one of my Twitter photos, which they shouldn't have. 
[03:02:30]  Who did?  Twitter, because I had a picture of a strap-on lady or something.  Like, it's a movie at my house.  And, uh, bam!  I Twittered a photo of it, and they're like, it violates...  They usually remove the photo.  What do you mean?  They did remove it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah.  But it didn't violate anything.  Oh, really?  You gotta find another site.  I forget which one is good with that stuff.  You just gotta find another site for those special pictures you wanna tweet.  Gotta have a couple different places you can go with your stuff.  Oh, yeah.  I don't Twitter that.  You gotta stay one step ahead of them. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Let's, uh, break.  Oh, oh, uh, we don't have time to play Billy the Bassman now.  Ten o'clock hour.  We're really starting to produce the ten o'clock hour.  In the ten o'clock hour today, you'll hear the original Billy the Bassman bit.  Uh, cut down, by the way, because we did it all morning.  Oh, yeah.  We went on and on.  I think we got a ten-minute version for everybody in the ten o'clock hour, and then you can decide  for yourself if it's, if it's exactly what SNL ripped off.  Yes.  Please.  Hey, man, we gotta go right to the phones. 
[03:03:30]  We got John Jones on the, on the line.  UFC 128, right?  Yes.  Oh, the press conference is Wednesday at Radio City Music Hall at 1230, free and open  to the public.  I didn't know that.  Broadcast live on UFC.com. 
[03:04:00]  So, let's say hi to John Jones.  John is the, uh, main event.  Yes, of course he is.  Hey, uh, Mr. Jones, how are you, sir?  Welcome to the show.  Hey, I'm doing good.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good, good.  Are you in New York yet?  Yes, I am.  I'm actually in New Jersey.  Oh, okay.  We should have had you come in.  Where, what part?  Are you close to the city?  Uh, yeah, I am close to the city.  I'm not sure of my exact location, so.  Okay.  Oh, that's right.  You're probably in town.  When did you come in? 
[03:04:30]  I got in yesterday morning.  So, what are you going to do?  Are you, I know you got to train all week, or are you done with training now?  No, I'm going to train all week.  I got to have this interview with you guys, and then, uh, you got to get, uh, fitted for a suit,  and then I'm going to go work out at, uh, Crufield Nurses Gym called the Watt Academy  over by Soho, and then I'm going to work out later on tonight, um, around the time I'll  be fighting at the hotel, probably do a little cardio blast.  Okay.  Uh, John, you're fighting in, uh, five days.  So, why do you still have to work out? 
[03:05:00]  What could you possibly learn in five days, sir?  Uh, I'm not going to try to learn anything new.  All that stuff is already done.  I'm just trying to get adjusted, get my lungs adjusted to, uh, uh, having, uh, you know,  not being in good, great cardio, uh, at sea level.  Oh.  All right, there you answer the question, because I'm thinking five days out, you guys just want  to just completely chill and just, uh, you know, wait for the fight.  Nope, nope, no.  I train at high altitude in Albuquerque, and, uh, I'm trying to push myself to a different 
[03:05:30]  limit.  Gotcha.  Do you hate to impress, like, uh, week of the fight?  Because, I mean, you've got to be very, very focused on just fighting.  No, I don't, I don't mind doing press.  Uh, you know, fighting is who I am.  It's a part of my being, and it's, like, second nature to me now.  So, uh, despite anything, you know, anything I do before the fight, uh, once that cage closes,  uh, whatever I've trained will just come, come to pass, so.  How much, and you're fighting for the, uh, the belt.  How much time, uh, have you had to get ready for this fight?  Because I know it was not supposed to be fighting. 
[03:06:00]  Uh, yeah, not too much time.  I got to train for five weeks for this fight.  I, I just competed, uh, not too long ago against Ryan Bader, so.  Yeah, and how long would it normally, would you train for?  Normally, I would put it in about eight weeks.  So, Rashad Evans got hurt, he hurt his knee, and then all of a sudden they just tell you  that you're fighting Shogun.  Yep, just like that.  And, uh, do you have the option, I, I, did they offer this to Rampage, and he said,  no, there's not enough time, or was that a rumor?  No, that's, that's totally true.  I think Rampage weighs about 250 right now, and, uh, I think he would have spent the whole 
[03:06:30]  five weeks just trying to lose, uh, you know, 10 pounds a week, um, so that's just wouldn't  be possible for him.  Wait, why would you, why would you go up to 250 if you're an active fighter?  I don't get that.  I understand after fights you want to chill out and, uh, you know, live your life a  little bit, but, uh, gain that much weight sounds a little crazy.  Uh, Keith.  Mm-hmm.  Hello?  Much of a, uh, trainer in his off time.  We couldn't, John, we couldn't hear you, your phone cut out a little bit.  No, I'm sorry.  We heard you.  Can you hear me now? 
[03:07:00]  Yes, now I can.  Can you hear me now?  Yep, I love that commercial.  And, can you hear me now?  Yes.  And, I love that commercial.  That's it.  Perfect.  Can you hear us?  I was saying the key word was an active fighter, and I don't really think Rampage is very active  on his downtime.  Oh, okay, he just kind of sits around and eats?  Yeah.  That's funny, Rampage just gets fat in between fights.  If he was here right now, I would never be laughing at that.  I'd be like, come on, man, that's bullshit.  No, no, no, no, not at all.  Have you fought him or no?  Even in amateur or no?  No, I haven't, but I've been watching him since I was a young kid, and, uh, you know, 
[03:07:30]  I'd be honored to fight Rampage.  Um, how do you feel at UFC, uh, kind of gobbling up Strikeforce?  Um, uh, you know, I think that's interesting, you know.  Strikeforce was a good leverage for a lot of fighters to, uh, be, have a little more negotiation  power, and now that the UFC officially owns the whole game of MMA, um, you know, I guess  what Dana says totally goes now, which is cool with me, because I'm on his good side.  Thank you.  You just said what we think. 
[03:08:00]  We, we help take down regular radio, and then, guess what?  There's, there's, there's no competition, so then the company that you help make bigger,  uh, they just, uh, you know, kind of screw you on the low end.  Yeah.  Of course these guys aren't excited that they're coming together.  We love Dana White, and we think he does take care of his people more than, uh, most  or whatever, but, uh, yeah.  You can't negotiate with anyone else now.  Right, and Dana White definitely takes great care of me, and he does so much behind the scenes  that people don't realize between charity events, um, you know, he's paid for fighters' 
[03:08:30]  personal health things, but he's loaned money to fighters.  He, I mean, he really is, uh, he really is the king of MMA, and I appreciate the role that  he plays.  Yeah, I, I think he'll, uh, in the end take care of you guys, but, I mean, from a fan  standpoint, to see some of these guys in the UFC now, that's really exciting.  But isn't it better, too, because you have, like, one NFL, you have one NBA, even though  you have different teams and stuff, isn't it kind of better to all be under one umbrella  so it doesn't all get splintered, and, you know what I mean, it's kind of easier to 
[03:09:00]  focus on the sport when there's just one league.  Absolutely, absolutely, and, you know, I know Strikeforce in the past has had some issues  with professionalism, so, um, I think that, uh, Dana, taking over, it can only be a good  thing.  I mean, look what he's done with the UFC, the WEC, uh, you know, he's, he's very business  savvy, and I'm sure this will only be good for the sport in a lot of ways.  Are you nervous that you haven't had enough time to train?  Is there any part of you that says, like, hey, I'm glad I'm doing this, I got, like,  lucky by, by the numbers that, uh, you know, uh, Rampage couldn't do it, and, and  Evans got hurt, but is there any part of you that's a little nervous about not having 
[03:09:30]  enough time?  No, not at all, man, uh, Ali said a quote that said, uh, don't count the days, make  the days count, and that's what I've done, there's, uh, there's 24 hours in a day, and  I, uh, I really, really take advantage of every hour, uh, by, uh, you know, studying on  my free time, eating healthy, training, uh, working fast, switch muscles, working, working  everything, and, uh, I feel totally prepared.  And, uh, you're, you're going to be at the press conference, uh, which is Wednesday  at 1230 at Radio City here in New York, and it's, uh, again, like Ope said, UFC.com, and 
[03:10:00]  it's free and open to the public, and they said that the fans who come to the press conference,  you're going to get a free UFC t-shirt while supplies last, so, um, if you guys want to  go to the press conference, if you get there on time, you will get some, uh, a shirt if  they have them.  If they don't, um, you get nothing.  This is going to be really sweet and nothing.  Yeah, you get to see if you can lift Rampage up.  I, I, I talked to Dana about the press conference, and, uh, he's got seven shirts, so that's,  uh, very, very good news.  Get there early, though.  I'm going to go fast. 
[03:10:30]  Seven shirts for everybody.  No, there's more than seven shirts.  Oh, sorry.  He's probably got fucking pink berries spilled on all of them, too.  Has Dana, has Dana made you eat pink berry yet?  Are you guys kind of tired of Dana and his pink berry obsession?  I haven't heard of this.  Oh, it's all he tweets about.  It's, he gets every pair of gloves he gives away is behind a pink berry somewhere.  It's really this creepy relationship with this delicious food he has.  Yeah, it's funny.  Yeah, hey, uh, on top of that press conference, um, a manager called the Everlast Company, and,  uh, I'm going to be signing, uh, tons of gloves and, uh, MMA gloves and boxing gloves and just 
[03:11:00]  MMA apparel and handing that out also.  So, guys, make sure you're there because, uh, you don't want to miss that opportunity.  I've only met you one time very briefly backstage, and, uh, you seem like you're pretty fan-friendly.  Uh, most of you guys are pretty cool with the fans.  Uh, yeah, I love the fans.  I realize that it's a spectator sport, and without fans watching it, I mean, who will  we be, really?  Now, you're in a relationship.  How hard is it to kind of, is it, how hard is it to avoid the women?  I mean, it's got, you know, you're a fighter.  Women love fighters. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, yeah, and sexy tall chocolate one, too.  Yeah.  I don't want to phrase it like that, but it's kind of what I was thinking.  You know you think I'm hot.  No, I'm joking.  Um, no, I actually have a girlfriend that I'll be marrying within the next year or so,  so, uh, um, you know, girls aren't too much of a problem for me.  And how far before a fight, is it a big myth that fighters don't have sex before they fight?  Like, how long do you give your body without it because you want to keep your energy?  Is that true, or is that bullshit?  Uh, no way, man.  I just masturbated last night, so, uh. 
[03:12:00]  That's great.  I don't know.  I guess I could be a fighter, then.  All right.  That's, uh, a myth.  So, yeah, you know, so you don't, you don't have to be, like, a month before.  It doesn't mean anything to you?  Hmm.  Hello?  Testing.  He's gone.  Uh-oh.  Because we, uh, lost him.  I was done with him.  No, that wasn't me this time, I swear.  No, no one hung up on him.  Tsunami.  Hello?  Something happened.  Uh, hello?  Hello?  Ding dong.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  I remember that. 
[03:12:30]  Of course you do.  I had three questions left.  Hello?  Anyone else in here?  Hello?  Hey, who's this?  Ding dong.  What happened to John Jones?  Ding dong.  Hello?  Hello?  John?  Hold on.  Help.  Hello?  Hey, what up, guys?  Are you there?  Yes.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Anyone in here? 
[03:13:00]  Hmm.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hey, John, we're back.  Are you on an iPhone?  Yeah, what phone are you on?  Because we don't want that phone.  Yeah, we, uh, we got cut off.  What phone are you on?  I'm on a Crackberry.  Oh, all right.  I just threw mine in the garbage.  Do the same.  What service?  And I was the biggest fan of those guys.  TNT.  TNT, of course.  How did we know?  Exactly.  It was lousy AT&T.  He's across the river, and we can't hear him.  I think you said you masturbated and hung up.  I'm like, what a great outline that is.  I really am.  I like to end every conversation like that. 
[03:13:30]  I don't know where we were, John.  I'm sorry.  Just a couple more questions.  The press conference is, again, the fight is, let me promote the fight.  It is Saturday night.  You're fighting for the Light Heavyweight Championship against Shogun.  Uriah Faber is on the bill.  Eddie Wineland.  And I never know how to say this guy's name.  Yoshihiro Akiyama?  That's right.  Oh, I actually got it right.  Okay.  And the press conference, you get a free shirt while supplies last if you go Radio City 1230.  Can you act at all?  Because, like, all these guys are doing movies.  Can you act? 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, I think I can act pretty well.  Definitely.  Have you ever taken an acting class, or do you just kind of think you could just wing it?  I haven't, but I was, like, a singer in high school and stuff like that.  And I was around the same field of things, I think.  And what is, this is the last question I have for you, because we, what is the closest  to fight time you've ever had to go to the bathroom?  I'm upset.  I pee constantly.  And I'm thinking, like, besides the fact that I get the shit beat out of me, having to go  into a ring, what do you do if you go into the ring and you've got to go to the bathroom?  You know what?  It was funny, because you have to have the commission to watch you tape your hands and 
[03:14:30]  watch you tape the gloves onto your hands.  Oh, my God.  This phone went again.  This is not me.  No, we're not.  Hello.  People get confused.  Hello.  I know what he's...  Are you there, John?  He's here.  I'm here.  Okay.  So we heard up to the point where, obviously, the commissioner or somebody has to watch you  get your hands taped and stuff, so there's no funny business going on.  I already know what you're going to say.  So now you're all wrapped up, and now you have to take a leak, so someone has to pull your  wiener out, right? 
[03:15:00]  No, not exactly.  I was so nervous for the Stefan Bonner fight, I actually had to poop with my MMA gloves on,  and then I had to wipe with my MMA gloves on.  It was just so awkward.  Oh, shit.  Let's be honest with each other.  We're men.  Did you leave a little on the gloves to make it hurt a little more?  I got a little spur in the front of the gloves.  I think that's funny.  How long before fight time did you actually take a dump? 
[03:15:30]  Is it on again?  This is too good.  This is good shit.  Oh, those phones.  I'm just really going to step in there and get pink eye.  Oh, no.  You cut out, and it obviously had a great line.  Yeah, this AT&T is just horrendous.  I think what we missed, Jimmy said how...  How long before the fight was that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How long before you went into the ring?  I said I pooped about 15 minutes before the fight, and I'm really glad Seth didn't get pink eye.  Oh, yeah.  That's correct. 
[03:16:00]  How great would that be if you just got shit in his eye and got disqualified for that?  You'd be an MMA legend.  That's horrible.  I love it.  John Jones, you know, we just became big fans of yours.  Yeah, you know what?  Next time I'll have to come into the studio and do it in person.  Yeah, we would like that.  Yeah, we would like that.  It's much easier.  All right, we'll promote the fight.  It's Saturday night.  A lot of us are going, so we can't wait.  Yeah, UFC 128, and it's going to be the press conferences on UFC.com, 1230.  Now, is this fight being shown, this is a pay-per-view, or is this being shown for free? 
[03:16:30]  Oh, it is pay-per-view.  Okay.  What a dumb question.  Is it for free?  What a naive child's question that was.  Is it for free?  Mister, is it for free?  All right, it's at...  I'm sorry, John.  No, it's definitely not free, buddy.  All right.  And it's at Prudential Center in Newark.  I'm not sure if tickets are available.  Can I ask one last hack question?  I love asking you guys this.  Worst injury you had?  Because it just amazes me what kind of punishment you guys could take. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, worst injury that I've had?  Actually, I haven't had any injuries yet.  I think probably what happened the most that really hurt was I twisted my wrist, a few  cams back, and I had to continue training with a really sore wrist.  Oh, that's not that bad.  Yeah.  Compared to other things.  No.  All right.  All right.  Well, good luck Saturday, John, and I really hope you beat him.  I would like to see you be the next light heavyweight champion.  All right, man. 
[03:17:30]  I appreciate it.  Big time.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  We'll see you Saturday.  Thank you, John.  John Jones, everyone, from the UFC.  Yeah, we'll see him Saturday.  AT&T is just so...  They fucked up our interview.  What an embarrassingly bad service.  He's right over in Jersey, and we can't hear him.  But it goes up into space.  I was at my brother's restaurant yesterday.  I wanted to tweet some shit, and I couldn't get a signal in my own restaurant.  It's fucking horrible.  It's so fucking infuriating.  I'm looking forward to that fight, actually.  Yeah, it's going to be good. 
[03:18:00]  I like to clap and yell, yay.  A lot of yay?  Yeah.  I like to act like a retard at events.  We're going to have fun.  You need to show me...  I have to tape something after this, so you have to show me your card, who you know,  at the thing, so I can look...  Nope.  I might know them.  That was a tease.  I can't have the expert.  Is their name Steve J-O...  I don't want to say his name.  Wait a minute.  You know the same expert?  Better get him quick.  How do you know this guy?  Somebody slid him under my door. 
[03:18:30]  He's skinny.  How do you know this guy?  Oh, I know.  I was just joking.  I was saying Steve Jobs.  I was kidding.  Well, it is a Steve.  Oh.  Yes.  Hello.  Yes.  I can't help you.  I can...  I have no idea where they are.  Everything you use it for, though, will have my logo on it.  I have the iPod.  I sit on it.  I put it in my man purse.  Ha ha ha.  Our pal, Dr. Michu Kaku. 
[03:19:00]  And I hope we get him back on the show soon.  He's very busy with the rest of the media.  He'll get to us eventually again, I'm sure.  He was on our show April 19th, 2010.  So almost a year ago.  A year ago.  About 11 months ago.  Okay?  Give or take.  And this is what he said 11 months ago on our show.  Now, obviously, 2012 BS.  What's the one thing we've got to worry about as humans? 
[03:19:30]  What's the next big thing?  You told us last time an earthquake taking out a city, a major city.  Tsunami.  A tsunami.  Right?  Yeah, well, if you take a look at disasters now, okay, volcanic eruptions take place on  the scale of centuries.  But earthquakes, you know, we are overdue for a big one in California and Tokyo.  And so in our lifetime, in our lifetime, we'll probably see one or more of these great cities 
[03:20:00]  reduced to near rubble.  And we're just going to have to prepare for that fact.  He said Tokyo.  He was pretty damn close.  Yeah.  Close.  It was off the coast of Japan and sort of off the coast of Tokyo.  Yeah, I know.  That's pretty fucking pretty good, man.  11 months ago, he said that.  We're due.  Yeah, no.  He just took a guess two places.  I bet you in another interview, he said, you know, someplace New Jersey.  Yeah, that's all he does.  Well, it tricks me up.  He just names every place.  Or, I guess you're right.  I mean, if you're playing the odds in Vegas, you would pick California and fucking... 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, Japan.  Ring of fire.  Ring of fire.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  What was Dr. Steve's fucking rebuttal?  It was going to be a meteor strike.  Yeah.  Well, you know, predicting an earthquake.  Yeah, that's really good science.  Just saying maybe it'll happen.  That's exactly right.  Everybody knows that earthquakes happen.  And so, I guess he's Nostradamus, and you can just call him when you need your Valtrex  refilled, as opposed to me or somebody in my profession. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, shit.  That's great.  We can predict these things with a certain amount of accuracy, but he just hates Kaku.  Oh, he really does.  If Kaku said Cleveland, Ohio, and some other weird, obscure place, then it would be impressive.  I'm backing off that prediction.  You're right.  California and Japan.  Okay.  Yeah.  That would be number one and number two for the big earthquake, right?  Yeah.  I have a system for predicting earthquakes, Gregory. 
[03:21:30]  Oh.  What is it?  I take a nickel, and I stand it on its end, right by the end of the table.  And if it falls over, you better duck.  What would ducking do?  I don't know, because then the things won't fall on you, I guess.  I haven't been in one yet.  I don't know what to do.  But one time, the nickel fell over, and I got it to the table.  But then I realized my uncle had just knocked it off, and he went,  Wait, why are you down there, Teddy?  Get over here.  He fooled me. 
[03:22:00]  Your uncle?  Yes.  My uncle Paul fooled me.  He fooled you.  I thought there was an earthquake.  He said, quick, breathe through this.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  My mother was picking a meatloaf up off the floor.  Her lover had gotten angry and thrown it at her.  A full meatloaf.  Did she deserve it?  I don't know.  She was just talking about Babburgers. 
[03:22:30]  And her lover said, bitch, because he was an African-American gentleman.  Oh, okay.  He said, bitch, shut up about motherfucking Babburgers.  And he threw a meatloaf at her.  Babburgers.  The meatloaf slammed it in the side of her head and gave her stitches.  She had to get stitches?  She had to get stitches.  I was just terrorized.  I said, oh, mother, be careful.  I thought the earthquake got her.  I'm like, meatloafs are falling from the sky.  There's black feet by my face. 
[03:23:00]  Why are there African-American tootsies by my face?  Oh, I forgot your special friend is over.  My mother and I lay there on the floor for hours waiting for the tsunami.  Did it ever come?  I thought it did, but apparently her lover had thrown his wine at her.  But I thought the tsunami had come.  It was just wine thrown at her?  It was just wine. 
[03:23:30]  Because I was wondering, how come the tsunami is purple and there's a glass after it?  I didn't understand what happened.  I was young.  Why would you stay with such a guy?  I don't know.  Apparently he put it to her good.  At least that's what he told me.  He said, whenever I'm with that bitch, my meat don't loaf.  And I laughed like I got the joke, but I didn't.  I'm like, mother, this is one odd darky. 
[03:24:00]  What is he doing here?  Fucking Jimmy.  It's not Jimmy.  That's Ted.  Oh, well, whoever it is.  You put a nickel up right by the edge of the table.  And if it falls off, there's an earthquake coming.  That's Theodore.  I don't think there's any scientific fact of it.  There certainly is.  Have you ever seen a nickel stand up through an earthquake?  I'll ask my case.  I'll sue you for defamation. 
[03:24:30]  Better look out then.  Certainly better.  Help, there's an earthquake.  Get over here.  Breathe through this, Teddy.  I don't understand the breathing.  I didn't either, but I didn't.  For a tsunami, probably.  I didn't know.  But I just did what I was told.  It was very confusing.  My head kept hitting the back of the table.  He was wearing slacks.  Slacks?  Yes.  They had meatloaf sauce on them.  He loved Mother's Meatloaf. 
[03:25:00]  Beverly Sheckler was known for her meatloaf.  Beverly Sheckler.  Up and down the block, they would rave about Mother's Meatloaf.  Except her African-American friend.  He said it tasted like shit, and he threw it at her.  He said, bitch, the motherfucking meatloaf cold.  And she had to get stitches.  She had to get stitches.  She had to go to the hospital.  I thought she was injured in the earthquake.  I dragged her by her bosom under the table with me.  I grabbed her breasts, and I pulled her to safety. 
[03:25:30]  And then I got meatloaf and ate it, but it had fur on it from the floor.  Bambergers.  That's an awful start.  She would talk about Bambergers a lot.  She would say, well, today on Socks, we had...  And she would describe whatever incident had occurred.  Not the most exciting stuff.  No, no, it doesn't say that.  Do you know one time a pair of socks was missing?  We heard about it for a month.  Oh, God.  That doesn't sound exciting.  It certainly doesn't. 
[03:26:00]  Especially when Mother's drinking and telling you.  It's 3 o'clock in the morning in my room, telling me about it.  Oh, she hits the bottle?  Yes, she did.  What do the neighbors that talk about the meatloaf think about her mail company that she keeps?  I don't think they care for her very much.  No?  No.  I think they think she lives by the river because they kept yelling, river lover.  Oh.  Maybe you were hearing wrong.  Or maybe they thought that he was taller because they thought that she was a bigger lover.  I didn't understand what they were saying. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, yeah, again, you probably, something in your ear.  Yes.  A piece of meatloaf.  I don't know what it was.  Or they were yelling, go figs your mother.  Something like that.  Go figs your mother.  Fucking drool.  Ted's got meatloaf all over the house.  Looks like it was a, should be called a meatloaf emporian.  Emporian?  Does Ted have an emporian for Japan?  I certainly don't, Gregory. 
[03:27:00]  Okay, just that.  Ted went off on a tangent.  He sure did.  Holy shit.  That's called limping to the finish line.  Nah, man.  Two and a half minutes.  Let's go.  We could do this.  We could do this.  Two and a half minutes.  We could do this.  You don't want two and a half minutes because you ain't going to get Ted in the office.  Oh, well, why don't we end the show early then?  Where's Jimmy going to be?  Jimmy will be in Boston doing the Wilbert the Pig Theater.  It's like, I don't know, something. 
[03:27:30]  And then it's called Despicable, the CD or something.  And I don't know what you do.  You get it in stores.  You get it in stores.  Something.  Or something.  Hi-ya.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  You know what?  I'll go to E-Rock.  E-Rock, what's going on in the 10 o'clock hour?  Roland.  What?  What's going on in there?  Does he even listen to our show?  We're listening.  Roland just wouldn't stop talking.  Me love food. 
[03:28:00]  All right, we get it.  Me love food.  I love when he yells, me love food.  E-Rock, be honest.  You didn't even know we were going to.  No, I did.  I was sitting right here looking at you.  But Roland kept yapping to whoever else was in the room here.  At 10 o'clock, we got Billy the Bass Man.  We're going to highlight Snoop's last appearance from The Wire on our show.  Only appearance.  Only appearance.  And Carrie Byron from Mythbusters.  We're going to feature some highlights from that.  Oh, nice.  Wow.  And it's the anniversary of that Pamela girl who sang The Sign on the show. 
[03:28:30]  Wow.  Oh, she was great.  Oh, nice.  All the swines.  All the swines.  It opens up my eyes.  All the love is to mine, dude.  Oh, why can't I play it?  Nice.  All the swines.  And it whoopened.  She was so bad.  I don't know where it is.  I want to play it.  You guys will play it?  Love that.  Yeah, we made her come in and perform it live in front of an audience in the studio. 
[03:29:00]  Are you going to play the original, though, too?  We can do both if you want.  Of course.  It started with this, and then we had her come in and do it live.  That's what you do.  I would start E-Rock.  You play them both.  I got to go soon, because apparently I got to talk to Sammy on the way out the door.  I'm going to rush to the elevator and talk to Sammy.  I heard you do that.  That was hilarious.  We want the illusion that we're just still doing show as we go to the elevator. 
[03:29:30]  The illusion.  But Jimmy decided to tear down one of the walls.  No, no, no.  I haven't talked to Sammy on the way to the elevator.  Jim, you got a second on the way out?  Yeah, I'm going to rush.  Let's get to the...  On the way out, but I'm getting my coat or something.  Okay.  We'll rush out of here.  Before we get to the elevator.  Before we get to the elevator.  Why don't we get the fuck out of here?  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Jimmy, you going to be here tomorrow?  I am until 8.30, and then I have to go shooting for the Tonight Show this week.  All right, so we get a little Jimmy time this week.  That's nice.  All right, stick around for the 10 o'clock hour. 
[03:30:00]  It's so worth sticking around now that we finally decided to produce that hour.  So, all right.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. </pre>
